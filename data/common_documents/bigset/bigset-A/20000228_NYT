 By JONATHAN FEIGEN  
 c. 2000, Houston Chronicle  
LOS ANGELES _ Shaquille O'Neal gave Steve Francis a way out, an
escape from this disaster. Like falling on a stack of grenades, it
would not have been pretty or painless. But it might have beaten
the catastrophe well under way.
<TEXT>
<P>
   O'Neal had stopped on his way to the free-throw line to flip the
ball back to an official. Instead, he bounced it directly off
Francis' shoulder. Francis shot back a mock glare as if considering
a re-enactment of the early-season Charles Barkley-O'Neal
Wrestlemania act.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing came of it. But Francis would have been better off in
the rumble. He would have given up 10 inches and 140 pounds. But he
would have come closer than he and the Rockets did the rest of the
day.
</P>
<P>
   The Rockets eventually lost by only 101-85 to the Los Angeles
Lakers on Sunday, but that has become an increasingly frequent
measure of Rockets success _ how little they lose by.
</P>
<P>
   Having spent the season fighting off such ignominy, the Rockets
have been slapped around in four of the past seven games, even
without Francis choosing not to go Barkley on O'Neal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't like it worth a ,'' Rockets coach Rudy Tomjanovich
said. ``We have to work our way out of this thing somehow. This is
embarrassing.''
</P>
<P>
   It was not, however, unusual. It barely stood up to the recent
no-contest collapses against the Hawks, Spurs and Nuggets. This
time, the Rockets made their too-late run a bit earlier. With the
Lakers having become as disinterested as the beat-the-traffic crowd
that deserted the high-dollar seats, the Rockets rallied from as
much as 26 back to within 12 with 5:06 left.
</P>
<P>
   Cuttino Mobley, who has become the Rockets' expert trash
collector of garbage time, scored 17 points in the fourth quarter
and finished with 29. In the Rockets' four recent collapses, he has
averaged 25.8.
</P>
<P>
   But his effort did little but force Lakers coach Phil Jackson to
wake up O'Neal and Kobe Bryant and send them back to the mismatch.
Each scored the first time he touched the ball, and the Rockets
never sneaked within 10.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went to church this morning with Ernestine Bradley (wife of
presidential candidate Bill Bradley), and I saw more energy there
than on this court,'' Jackson said. ``I thought we played an
energetic first quarter, and then we just hit the punch bag.''
</P>
<P>
   Presumably, hitting the punch bag meant the Lakers merely went
through the motions, having waylaid the Rockets from the opening
bell. The Rockets' late rally could not hide a horrible shooting
day or the way Bryant and O'Neal toyed with them.
</P>
<P>
   Stymied from the outset by Bryant's quick-footed defense,
Francis missed his first nine shots, giving him a run of 15
consecutive misses going back to the Denver disaster of Thursday.
He finished with six points and seven turnovers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Steve just couldn't get going today,'' Tomjanovich said. ``I
mean, we couldn't do the simplest deals. I was hoping he would work
his way out of it. We talked about it at halftime, taking a little
bit of your aggressiveness out. If your ball-handling is
struggling, get into the flow of the game, letting the ball come
back to you and getting off the schneid that way.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him to slow down. We looked at the tape a little bit at
halftime. There were plays that it had nothing to do with the
defense. He was just overanxious, kicking it.''
</P>
<P>
   Francis blamed himself for the loss. ``I (messed) it up,'' he
said again and again.
</P>
<P>
   But he was far from the Rockets' only problem. By the end of the
first quarter, they had fallen behind 30-13, their lowest-scoring
opening quarter of the season. Bryant cruised to 18 points in the
first 12 minutes, and the Lakers seemed bent only on winning easily
enough to rest for Tuesday's showdown with Portland.
</P>
<P>
   The Rockets were so outmatched with their starters that
Tomjanovich began the second quarter with a lineup of Pig Miller,
Matt Bullard, Bryce Drew, Moochie Norris and Mobley.
</P>
<P>
   It was not an improvement, and the Rockets' 29-point half was
their worst of the season.
</P>
<P>
   But with Bryant matching his season high with 31 points and
O'Neal rolling to 24 points, 13 rebounds and eight assists,
Tomjanovich was more critical of the Rockets' defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our defense has been horse (manure),'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And with all that, the Rockets were stumped to understand what
had gone wrong since their Super Bowl Sunday upset of the Lakers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no explanation, no reasons,'' Kenny Thomas said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was embarrassing,'' Mobley said, ``because it was on NBC,
and to go out there and watch Kobe go for layups, dunks, laughing
and smiling, we'd have tried anything.''

LAKERS WIN; BLAZERS ARE NEXT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Sometime between the Lakers' last losing skid and
their current winning streak, Sunday's payback game against the
Houston Rockets became a nationally televised formality. An
afterthought.
</P>
<P>
   But a necessary prelude, as well.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers entered the day tied with the Portland Trail Blazers
for divisional supremacy, and for the best record in the league.
The rivals play Tuesday night, for the final time this season, and
for dramatic emphasis all they needed was to keep pace with one
another.
</P>
<P>
   Easy enough for the Lakers, who beat up on the Rockets 101-85 at
Staples Center, thus assuring a perfect script for the date at the
Rose Garden.
</P>
<P>
   The Blazers earlier held off the Utah Jazz, leaving them tied
with the Lakers in both win-loss record (45-11) and winning streak
(11 each).
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in a groove right now, we're in a rhythm, so we're going
up there with that groove we have now,'' said Kobe Bryant, who
scored a game-high 31 points. ``It's important to have a game like
we had today, nationally televised. It's good for our momentum,
good for our confidence.''
</P>
<P>
   And good for the soul. They needed a cleansing after a loss at
Houston last month that coach Phil Jackson characterized as
pathetic, their worst game of the season.
</P>
<P>
   There was never any danger of a sequel.
</P>
<P>
   Bryant held fleet-footed rookie Steve Francis to zero points in
the first half, and six in the game, and the Lakers shot better
than 50 percent (41 for 77) for the third game in a row.
</P>
<P>
   It took an unaesthetic second half -- in which the Lakers simply
nursed their double-digit lead -- for Jackson to find anything to
grouse about.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went to church this morning at the AME church downtown here.
... The AME had a lot more spirit there than we had today on this
court,'' said Jackson, who attended services with Ernestine
Bradley, wife of presidential candidate Bill Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   It only took one quarter of spirited play to get the win,
though. Bryant hammered the Rockets for 18 points out of the gate
as the Lakers took a 30-13 advantage. It put to rest any concern
over Bryant's bruised left calf -- especially he opened the game
with a one-handed fast-break jam -- though he admitted he's still
sore.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's bothering me,'' he said. ``On that first dunk I didn't
mean to even jump. Phil said, `What the hell are you doing?' I said
I didn't mean to. It just happened.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's funny, when you have injuries, your concentration tends
to pick up a little bit. You tend to focus a little bit more.''
</P>
<P>
   Shaquille O'Neal fed Bryant for his first three scores and
finished with a game-high eight assists, once again just missing a
triple-double. He finished with 24 points and 13 rebounds to go
with five blocked shots. Glen Rice added 17 points.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Bryant) played very well,'' O'Neal said. ``He took a lot of
shots, and he hit most of them. And on any given night, any one of
our top three can play that type of basketball.''
</P>
<P>
   It was enough to overwhelm the Rockets (21-35), and the Lakers
built as much as a 26-point lead in the second half. Then a
fired-up Cuttino Mobley almost single-handedly brought Houston
back, scoring 23 of his 29 points in the second half.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's embarrassing,'' Mobley said, ``because it's on NBC, just
watching Kobe lay it up and dunk it and laugh and smile. I don't
appreciate stuff like that. That team's an OK team, but without
Shaq, I just don't think, come on. It's just Shaq, he cleaned up
the whole lane.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rockets had happier thoughts about their next matchup here.
</P>
<P>
   ``The good news,'' said Matt Bullard, ``is that we've got the
Clippers next.''

USC LANDS RECRUIT HANOUR
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ USC received a verbal commitment from shooting
guard Travis Hanour of Laguna Beach High on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Hanour (6-foot-5, 200 pounds) selected the Trojans over Arizona,
Utah and San Diego State. He made his official visit to USC over
the weekend, and was in the locker room after the Trojans' 80-77
loss to Oregon at the Sports Arena.
</P>
<P>
   He is considered one of the rising stars in Southern California,
with many schools becoming interested in him this season. He is
considered a late bloomer, after not playing his sophomore season.
</P>
<P>
   Hanour is the third player to commit to USC. Shooting guard
Desmon Farmer of Flint, Mich., signed in November and point guard
Robert Hutchinson of Okaloosa-Walton Community College in
Niceville, Fla., committed in December.
</P>
<P>
   Clancy eager for return: Forward Sam Clancy has moved up his
comeback to Thursday against Stanford, but Clancy nearly made a
stunning attempt to against Oregon.
</P>
<P>
   Clancy participated in pre-game warm-ups, taking jump shots and
working on some post moves, and when he felt no pain, announced he
would play against the Ducks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I could play but the trainer wanted me to take it
easy,'' Clancy said.
</P>
<P>
   Clancy has been out since Jan. 20 with a broken foot, and a
return against Oregon would have been far sooner than expected. He
previously said he would come back for the Cal game on Saturday,
but after the Trojans' loss to Oregon, decided he wanted to make
his return Thursday in Palo Alto.
</P>
<P>
   USC coach Henry Bibby cautioned against false expectations when
Clancy returns.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's totally up to Sam when he returns, but Sam is not the
savior,'' Bibby said. ``We're not trying to put pressure on him.
Sam knows he's not in shape to play.''
</P>
<P>
   There is still a chance Clancy will not play this weekend, if he
experiences any flare-ups in his foot in practice.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it's hurting, then I will back off,'' Clancy said. ``I
might just rest.''
</P>
<P>
   His mere appearance in a uniform Saturday was surprising enough
for his teammates.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was interesting to see him out there,'' forward David
Bluthenthal said. ``It was kind of fun.''
</P>
<P>
   What's left? The Trojans (14-12, 7-7) know they need to win
their last four games for a shot at making the NCAA Tournament, but
what happens if they win three of their last four?
</P>
<P>
   That would give USC a 10-8 record in conference. Not impressive,
but no Pac-10 team that won at least 10 games has ever missed the
tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Working against the Trojans would be a 4-6 record in the final
10 games of the season, since that is one factor the selection
committee uses to pick at-large teams.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we get 10 wins, it's not in our hands to decide,'' forward
David Bluthenthal said. ``We know that we probably have to win out.
It will be tough going to the Bay Area. But not a lot of people
have given us a chance to all year.
</P>
<P>
   Guard play: For all of the focus on the offensive prowess of
forwards Brian Scalabrine and Bluthenthal, an easy way to gauge the
Trojans is the shooting of guards of Brandon Granville and Jeff
Trepagnier.
</P>
<P>
   In last week's loss to Arizona State, Granville and Trepagnier
were 9 for 28 from the field. In Saturday's loss to Oregon, they
were 4 for 18.
</P>
<P>
   But they made 9 of 17 shots in Thursday's victory over Oregon
State.
</P>
<P>
   ``We pounded the ball inside pretty well (against Oregon),''
Scalabrine said. ``That's usually enough for us.''

ATTENDEES SAY RAVES NOT ABOUT DRUGS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 BY CHRISTINA LEONARD  
 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Brandon Switzer calls himself the ``Boy Wonder.''
</P>
<P>
   As laser beams bounce over his head, the 18-year-old dances in a
sea of pulsating bodies, twirling his glow sticks to the endless,
dense, thumping beat resonating from inside a dark Mesa building
Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   His smile stretches from ear to ear.
</P>
<P>
   Rave scenes have come under the microscope since the arrest of
mob turncoat Salvatore ``Sammy the Bull'' Gravano, who is accused
of financing and operating a ring that dealt the drug Ecstasy to
Valley ravers.
</P>
<P>
   Organizers deny it, but police say 90 percent of the
midnight-to-dawn revelers imbibe in Ecstasy, alternately known as
``E,'' ``X'' or ``XTC,'' which produces a euphoric high and intense
feelings``'' of alertness and well-being.
</P>
<P>
   But ravers like Switzer said that leaves out the most important
part of raves: ``Most of us are here for the music and for PLUR _
peace, love, unity and respect.''
</P>
<P>
   ``No matter what you are: Black, White, green, bisexual . . . we
don't care,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Switzer was among the estimated 1,100 young people _ some
donning neon blue hairpieces, Afro wigs and blinking visors _ who
squeezed into the renovated Nile movie theater in Mesa on Saturday
night for the ``Daylight'' party.
</P>
<P>
   He doesn't deny that the designer drugs like Ecstasy and
Ketamine _ a horse tranquilizer _ permeate the scene, but shrugs
and says, ``We're just here to have fun'' and dances on.
</P>
<P>
   At the Nile, there were telltale signs of the drugs' presence _
trance-like stares, surgical masks, pacifiers. Ravers say they coat
the masks with Vicks Vapo Rub either to help them breathe or
enhance their high; the pacifiers help keep them from grinding
their teeth, a side effect common with Ecstasy.
</P>
<P>
   But that wasn't the whole scene.
</P>
<P>
   Organizers say they spent more than $18,000 preparing for
Saturday night's event _ they had to secure a venue, pay for
lighting, sound systems and a DJ, world-famous New Yorker named
Frankie Bones.
</P>
<P>
   Security was abundant.
</P>
<P>
   Girls in tube tops and feathered boas shivered outside the
building waiting in line for security officers to pat them down.
</P>
<P>
   After a search of one teen's wallet turned up something
suspicious, security officer Sal Augone tore open the tiny package
and threw the white-powdery substance in the plastic bin along with
the rest of the confiscated items like water bottles and surgical
masks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sorry buddy, we can't let you in,'' Augone told the
disappointed teen.
</P>
<P>
   A few other kids huddled outside, kicked out for looking too
drugged out, Augone said.
</P>
<P>
   Others paid $25 a head to rave until 6 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   Maria Espinosa, 25, said electronic dance music _ whether
trance, jungle hip-hop or hard-core _ brings people together in a
safe, happy environment.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you bump into somebody at a bar, they'll try to fight
you,'' she said. ``You do the same thing here, and they'll hug
you.''
</P>
<P>
   By 11 p.m., the theater was packed.
</P>
<P>
   It was a young crowd, with an average age of 17, dressed in
everything from simple white Polo shirts and baseball caps to silky
pajamas and pig tails to fishnet hose and nose rings.
</P>
<P>
   They wore blinking lights, edible candy and fairy wings; they
carried Pokemon dolls, water bottles and pacifiers. Glitter and Glo
sticks abounded.
</P>
<P>
   They danced on the stage, lingered by the walls and gave each
other massages. Some bounced their heads inches away from speakers,
others whirled Day-glo vials like nunchuks.
</P>
<P>
   Booths sold bottled water, Gatorade and Red Bull, an energy
drink.
</P>
<P>
   No alcohol or drugs were allowed, but that doesn't mean they
weren't there. In fact, most ravers don't deny the drug use.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure, some people take `X,' '' Switzer said. ``But I don't get
why they blame it on raves.''
</P>
<P>
   Alan Holcomb, an attorney who represents promoters, said there's
no way 90 percent of the kids were on drugs, as police indicated
last week, but he admitted that it's impossible to keep all
drug-use out.
</P>
<P>
   He and promoter Gino Carlucci say they do everything they can to
keep their raves clean, which distinguishes their parties from the
illegitimate parties.
</P>
<P>
   `` '' These illegal parties, which usually have no permits or
security, were the ones police targeted, Phoenix undercover
Detective Jim Gibbs said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't believe the availability of Ecstasy, GHB and
Ketamine,'' Gibbs said. ``It's pretty wild stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   He said dealers advertised Ecstasy or Ketamine by wearing
T-shirts or bracelets with ``X'' or ``E'' with a circle around it
and it wasn't uncommon to see kids passed out, throwing up or lying
on the ground in the parking lot.
</P>
<P>
   ``We get a bad rap because they think we're all on drugs,'' said
Aspen Tufares, 18. ``But you see just as many drugs here as you
would at any college party.''
</P>
<P>
   Every weekend, thousands of Valley ravers click on a Web site or
dial up recorded messages that direct them to abandoned warehouses,
airport hangers or desert areas so they, too, can join the masses
of young people who rave until dawn.
</P>
<P>
   The once-underground society has been throwing raves for years,
and has now become an international phenomenon that's more
mainstream, more commercialized, and more of a business than ever.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the culture has remained relatively quiet in the Valley _
until now. &QL;

BETTER LATE THAN NEVER? NOT FOR `GRAPEVINE' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BILL GOODYKOONTZ 
 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Networks often yank low-rated shows amid talk of returning them
``at a later date.''
</P>
<P>
   How about eight years later, with an almost totally different
cast?
</P>
<P>
   That's the story behind ``Grapevine,'' which returns to CBS
tonight. And the moral of said story?
</P>
<P>
   Not everything's worth waiting for.
</P>
<P>
   The ensemble takes us into the love lives of several attractive
young people who live in Miami. There are the cruise director, the
restaurant owner, the sportscaster, blah, blah, blah. With the
exception of George Eads as Thumper, the boneheaded sportscaster,
the cast is notable mostly for being unlikable _ especially Kristy
Swanson as the cruise director.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; The original ``Grapevine'' started a six-week run in the summer
of 1992. Although summer is usually a swampy graveyard for TV, CBS
had launched the hit show ``Northern Exposure'' the previous summer
and was looking for more magic.
</P>
<P>
   No rabbit in that hat. Shot without an audience, with characters
breaking the ``fourth wall'' between themselves and viewers and
with a decided emphasis on sex, ``Grapevine'' withered _ even
though plenty of shows adopted some or all of those features in
later years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I started to think, `Maybe we are a little bit late to the
table,' until I saw some of our rough cuts,'' says David Frankel,
the show's creator. ``I am still convinced there is nothing like
``Grapevine'' on television.''
</P>
<P>
   With good reason.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from sitting on the CBS shelf for almost the entire
Clinton administration, there is one other interesting aspect to
``Grapevin''e: It's a show about young, beautiful people on a
network that appeals to older viewers. (CBS president Les Moonves
told critics that ``my 15-year-old daughter said it's the first
show she's ever wanted to watch on CBS.'')
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know, I think it might be nice,'' Frankel says. ``The
timing might be right for this show to work on CBS.''
</P>
<P>
   It is toned down, he said. ``The old show was a lot about sex,
and how far could we push the envelope showing sex and talking
about sex,'' Frankel says. ``The new show, I like to think, is
about romance. It's a function of me being eight years older and
American culture being eight years older.''
</P>
<P>
   And with any luck, wiser _ wise enough to pass on
``Grapevine.'' &QL;

INHERITING THE WORLD: AMERICAN FOREIGN POLICY AFTER THE COLD WAR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By NORMAN LEVINE  
 c.2000 Special for The Arizona Republic  
 ALSO MOVING IN THE ``A'' CATEGORY 
 RETRANSMITTING INHERITING-1, INHERITING-2 and INHERITING-3 FOR
THOSE WHO MIGHT HAVE MISSED THIS SPECIAL PACKAGE BY NORMAN LEVINE 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the past hundred years, the United States has had three great
debates over foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
   From 1914 to 1917, President Wilson led the country into World
War I to make the globe ``safe for democracy.''
</P>
<P>
   From 1947 to 1949, America mobilized against Soviet communism,
and George F. Kennan devised the ``containment policy.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, as the nation prepares to select its first president of the
21st century, it has entered its third great debate, and the
question, baldly put, is this: Now that we have inherited the
world, how shall we rule it?
</P>
<P>
   What is at stake in the outcome of this debate is nothing less
than the peace and prosperity of all Americans in the coming
century. Fortunately, America is at peace at the moment, but with
the demise of the Soviet Union as the second-greatest
superpowerL{.Xcareas of instability and threat have surfaced on
international waters. Terrorism, the proliferation of nuclear,
chemical and biological weapons to rogue states such as Iraq, Iran
and North Korea, the rise of Islamic fundamentalism have brought a
series of mortal challenges to America's doorstep. The United
States must redefine its global role once again, for that act of
self-definition is vital to the security of the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Sadly, it is only every four years, at the time of the
presidential election, that Americans come to face these
life-and-death issues for themselves and for their children.
</P>
<P>
   The conditions in which this discussion takes place are uniquely
different from the 1914-17 and 1947-49 periods. Today, because of
its victory over Politburo totalitarianism, the United States
stands alone as the Earth's only superpower.
</P>
<P>
   The Cold War consensus, based on a bipolar standoff between the
United States and the Soviet Union, has imploded, and in the place
of this consensus a bewildering diversity of opinions has emerged
from the Washington foreign policy elites on how to manage Pax
Americana.
</P>
<P>
   These voices can be grouped into four categories, two
conservative and two liberal.
</P>
<P>
   On the right, the two camps are the Conservative Moralists and
the Conservative Realists. On the left, the two camps are the
Liberal Moralists and the Liberal Realists.
</P>
<P>
   The Dupont Circle area in Washington, D.C., is the miracle mile
of the foreign policy research establishment. Within the 20036 ZIP
code, it is only a five-minute walk among the Johns Hopkins School
of Advanced International Studies (Madeleine Albright's alma
mater), the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace and the
American Enterprise Institute. This is contested turf, a brutal
scrimmage line, for this ZIP code is a kind of foreign policy
football field in which Republican and Democratic advocates block
and tackle fiercely.
</P>
<P>
   Dressed Establishment casual, comfortable in a blue woolen
sweater, Robert Kagan, senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for
International Peace, told ``The Arizona Republic'' in January,
``The United States must be more assertive in advancing the
enlargement of democracy around the globe.''
</P>
<P>
   Kagan and fellow conservative Bill Kristol, editor of the
influential journal the ``Weekly Standard,'' coined the phrase
``benevolent American hegemony'' as a flashcard for their views on
U.S. foreign policy. (``Hegemony'' is code for ``we're in
charge.'')
</P>
<P>
   Kagan and Kristol are the leading exponents of what we will call
the school of Conservative Moralists. A deep strain of moralism
runs through their thinking, because they are unflinching in their
belief that democracy should be the universal form of government,
and they do not shy away from the fact that it may be necessary to
intervene in the affairs of other sovereign states if that is
necessary to bring them the American idea of freedom.
</P>
<P>
   A DAPTING WILSON &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Even though Kagan denies it, the Conservative Moralists are
indebted to the idealism of Woodrow Wilson. One part of Wilsonian
thought was to convince the world of the superiority of democracy,
and this is the part that Kagan and Kristol follow. Another part of
Wilson's thought was the belief that national interests should be
sacrificed to a League of Nations, and both Kagan and Kristol
reject this part.
</P>
<P>
   The school of Conservative Realists, whose most distinguished
practitioner is Henry Kissinger, rejects the moralism of Kagan and
Kristol. All the members of the realist school acknowledge that
democracy is the most desirable form of government, but they deny
that the United States has the missionary purpose of converting the
entire planet to democracy. For this camp, the proper end of
American diplomacy is the preservation of national security.
</P>
<P>
   Kissinger and like-minded policymakers are realists in the sense
that they see the world as made up of competing, self-interested
nations. For them, diplomacy is a jungle. In the spirit of Ronald
Reagan, this group is skeptical about international organizations,
although they see their usefulness. They also draw a line in the
sand between internationalism and the preservation of national
sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
   Conservative Realism is a doctrine that favors unilateral action
to defend the national self-interest of the United States. It
doubts the effectiveness of multilateral action _ for example, the
U.N. peacekeeping mission in Bosnia, which is widely acknowledged
to be a failure. The members of this school argue that the
multinational United Nations never has demonstrated its ability to
efficiently carry out its peacekeeping responsibilities.
</P>
<P>
   Straight and elegant, her mind as sharp as a quarterback in a
fourth-and-one-situation, Jeane Kirkpatrick, ambassador to the
United Nations under Ronald Reagan and now a professor at
Georgetown University and senior fellow at the American Enterprise
Institute, disagrees with the Kagan-Kristol School. A strong voice
within the conservative movement, Kirkpatrick doubts that democracy
can be spread through interventionist methods.
</P>
<P>
   REAGAN'S WAY &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Ronald Reagan, whom I admired as a great president,''
Kirkpatrick said, ``understood the sanctity of national
independence. The U.N. is a useful tool. All international
organizations are useful tools. I am not opposed to the U.N. But
one principle that Reagan stood by, and that I stand by, is that
the U.S. must never surrender its sovereignty or national
self-interests to any international organization.''
</P>
<P>
   The foreign policy agenda of the Republican Party is made up of
both Conservative Moralists and Realists. Gov. George W. Bush
himself stands squarely in the faction of Conservative Realism.
Many members of the realist school, including Condoleezza (EDITORS:
CORRECT) Rice, Elliot Abrams, Richard Perle and Paul Wolfowitz
(EDITORS: CORRECT) (all of whom held high foreign policy positions
in either the Reagan or Bush administrations), are currently
advisers to the present Bush presidential campaign. John McCain is
also a Conservative Realist, and one of his foreign policy advisers
is Henry Kissinger. Neither the Conservative Moralists nor Realists
are isolationists.
</P>
<P>
   The liberal Establishment also fields a team within the 20036
ZIP-code playing field, and the expertise of the Brookings
Institute is certainly playoff quality. Although it is primarily a
research center for scholars from all over the world, and as such
its public image must be as objective, the Woodrow Wilson Center,
yards away from the Dupont Circle, currently is headed by Lee
Hamilton, who presented to ``The Republic'' the arguments of the
Liberal Moralists.
</P>
<P>
   A Democrat and former member of Congress, Hamilton was chairman
of the House Foreign Relations Committee. Stately, and possessed of
a typical Hoosier friendliness, Hamilton said, ``The Republicans
are too quick to defend unilateral intervention. Even though
international organizations are imperfect, America must learn to
work in cooperation with them.''
</P>
<P>
   CARTER LEGACY &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The political heritage of the Liberal Moralists grows out of the
unusual alliance among Wilson, Jimmy Carter and Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   From Wilson, the Liberal Moralists take the ideas of the
dissemination of democracy, as well as a commitment to collective
security and internationalism. From Jimmy Carter, they borrow the
dogma of universal human rights, which includes the rights of
women, children and labor.
</P>
<P>
   The war in Vietnam served as a bloody lesson that the arrogant,
unilateral exercise of U.S. power can produce the diplomatic
isolation of the United States. Like the Conservative Moralists,
Liberal Moralists also advocate an expansive role for democracy and
the capitalist system. Unlike both the Conservative Moralists and
Realists, the Liberal Moralists are suspicious of unilateral
intervention as a means of disseminating democracy and human
rights. Liberal Moralists prefer to act within multilateral
institutions, such as the United Nations. For example, Liberal
Moralists favor humanitarian intervention under the umbrella of the
United Nations. The American involvement in Kosovo is presented as
a model of humanitarian intervention, for in this case the United
States became engaged to prevent the continued slaughter of
Kosovars, but under the aegis of the multilateral United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   Recognizing that globalization was one of the dominant
tendencies of the last decade of the 20th century, Liberal
Moralists are free-traders. A large corporatist faction exists
within Liberal Moralists, because multinational corporations see
the opportunity to harvest huge profits from the
internationalization of trade.
</P>
<P>
   Liberal Realists speak the language of national self-interest
and not the tongue of democratic moralism. Like the Conservative
Realists, their brethren the Liberal Realists take a dim view of
the idea that the purpose of American diplomacy is the conversion
of the globe to democracy. They also view the goal of international
relations as the preservation of American nationhood.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike their conservative brethren, however, Liberal Realists
perceive contemporary international relations as multipolar. They
stress the importance of the United States' working in harmony with
multilateral organizations because they see the danger of causing a
reaction against the American imperium. If the United States were
to pursue a unilateralist course of action, the Liberal Realists
argue, this would result in the undesirable development of an
``anti-hegemonist'' camp _ the alliance of Russia, China and Iran
to halt American primacy.
</P>
<P>
   CLINTON OPPOSED &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The most prominent members of the Liberal Realist camp are three
academicians: Professors Michael Mandelbaum and Robert W. Tucker
(emeritus) of the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International
Studies and Professor Ronald Steel of the University of
California-Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   True to their belief that America must show great restraint
before exercising unilateral action, the Liberal Realists opposed
the Clinton policy of NATO expansion. Mandelbaum's book ``The Dawn
of Peace in Europe'' is the classic statement against the need for
NATO enlargement on the grounds that it would drive Russia and
China together. Tucker's book ``The Imperialist Temptation''
criticized President Bush's Operation Desert Storm because it
represented U.S. overreach, extending U.S. responsibilities from
Western Europe, the original site of the American-Soviet standoff,
to the Persian Gulf, a colossal stretch of American national
interests.
</P>
<P>
   Clintonian foreign policy is an outgrowth of Liberal Moralism.
Although there are significant differences in terms of their
foreign policy, both Al Gore and Bill Bradley are members of the
Liberal Moralist wing of the Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   The grand foreign policy debate of the new millennium, the
search for the Second Coming of George F. Kennan, is essentially an
in-house dialogue among inhabitants of the Washington policy think
tanks. During the Kosovo entanglement the American people were
activated by TV war imagery to think about America's role in the
world, but Kosovo is over, and Americans again have turned their
gaze inward. It is Social Security, medical insurance, education
and taxes that consume their interest in this election year and not
``ethnic cleansing.''
</P>
<P>
   As Norman Ornstein, a specialist on Congress at the American
Enterprise Institute, pointed out, ``63 percent of the House of
Representatives were elected after the fall of communism.'' The
amount of money spent on agencies in the U.S. government dealing
with foreign affairs has been cut by Congress. The amount of money
given to international organizations also has been diminished. It
is truly a new world.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not that Congress is isolationist,'' Ornstein suggested,
``it is rather that Congress is insular. Domestic needs have taken
priority.''
</P>
<P>
   Unless there is a terrorist act of great bestiality, unless the
TV screen can show decapitated bodies and mangled limbs, Americans
will elect their first chief executive of the new century on issues
relating to homosexuality and abortion rather than on this
transformative moment of how the U.S. colossus should behave in the
world after it inherited this wondrous sphere.  &QL;

BUDROYALE GETS LOW TOP WEIGHT FOR BIG 'CAP
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARCADIA - Little separates Budroyale from General Challenge and
Cat Thief in the weight assignments announced Sunday for Saturday's
Santa Anita Handicap.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, nobody should have much complaint about rookie
racing secretary Michael Harlow's first Big 'Cap assignments, with
the possible exception of fans who like to see top horses tested by
heavy burdens.
</P>
<P>
   Budroyale will carry 122 pounds, General Challenge 121 and Cat
Thief 120. Malek, the 1998 Big 'Cap winner, and Puerto Madero are
next among likely starters at 118. Others: Dixie Dot Com, 117, and
Bagshot, 113.
</P>
<P>
   Budroyale's assignment is the lightest for a Big 'Cap highweight
since Helmsman (121) finished fourth behind Mr Purple (116) in
1996. The four-pound spread among the top five horses is the
tightest since 1994.
</P>
<P>
   ``Weight's never a concern (for the Budroyale camp),'' said
trainer Ted H. West, whose 7-year-old carried 121 to victory in the
San Antonio Handicap last time out.
</P>
<P>
   Tim Yakteen, assistant trainer of General Challenge, would have
liked to see his colt assigned the same weight as Breeders' Cup
Classic winner Cat Thief.
</P>
<P>
   ``But you're talking about a pound or two,'' Yakteen said.
</P>
<P>
   Entries for the $1 million, 1-mile race will be finalized
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Antley's back (way back): Chris Antley, the 1999 Triple Crown
hero who hadn't ridden since the Nov. 6 Breeders' Cup because of
weight and knee trouble, returned to the races with a last-place
finish aboard Dance Master in Sunday's Baldwin Stakes at Santa
Anita.
</P>
<P>
   ``It felt great,'' Antley said despite finishing 15 lengths
behind winner Fortifier ($15.80) and jockey Brice Blanc in the
6-furlong race moved from the soggy turf to the sloppy main track.
</P>
<P>
   Antley said his weight is down to 119 pounds and he hopes to get
to 117 during the Santa Anita meet. He said it has been easier to
get back in shape than it was a year ago when he came back and rode
Charismatic to victories in the Kentucky Derby and Preakness.
</P>
<P>
   Notes: Two-year-old champion Anees covered 6 furlongs in 1:12 on
a ``good'' track, the fourth fastest of 22 workouts at the distance
Saturday, and is aiming to make the March 19 San Felipe his first
start since winning the Breeders' Cup Juvenile in November. ``This
horse is a lot fitter than people think,'' said Richard Mulhall,
racing manager for The Thoroughbred Corp. Anees would use the April
8 Santa Anita Derby as a prep for the May 6 Kentucky Derby....
Leading rider Corey Nakatani skipped his last two scheduled mounts
Sunday after telling the stewards he banged his left foot while
finishing last aboard Sparquita in the first race.... Equine nose
strips will become legal at California tracks Wednesday. Only five
of the 70 horses entered for that day's card at Santa Anita are
scheduled to wear the breathing aids.... Bella Chiarra, who used to
be trained by the late Charlie Whittingham in California, won the
Rampart Handicap at Gulfstream Park in Florida for Pat Byrne. Jack
Mandato owns the 5-year-old mare.

 STARS, AVALANCHE MAKE FOR GOOD HOCKEY (For use by
NYTimes News Service clients) By JENNIFER FLOYD c.2000 Fort Worth
Star-Telegram
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ If the Stanley Cup playoffs began today, the Stars and
the Colorado Avalanche would play in the first round.
</P>
<P>
   Just in case you didn't notice that's the same two teams who
spent 65 minutes last night at Reunion Arena scrapping, clawing and
banging for every inch of space in 1-1 tie in overtime.
</P>
<P>
   ``Great,'' Stars coach Ken Hitchcock said as he rolled his eyes
before adding, ``only if we have to.''
</P>
<P>
   Anybody needing a refresher course on just how exciting, intense
and close games between these teams can be need only to watch last
season's Western Conference Finals.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars won the seven-game marathon on their way to winning
the Stanley Cup last season, but if last night showed anything it
is that it would be even closer this time around.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both teams were kind of desperate,'' Stars captain Derian
Hatcher said. ``After the game we played against Chicago. They were
slipping as well in the standings. I thought both teams
concentrated on the game.''
</P>
<P>
   The Avalanche came in losers of three straight games and were
looking at possibly not making the playoffs. The Stars were coming
off an embarrassing loss to lowly Chicago on Friday and are looking
at a week that includes games against legitimate Cup contenders,
Philadelphia, Phoenix and Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   Both teams wanted two points. Both teams were more than happy to
leave with one.
</P>
<P>
   Hitchcock said the hockey term for what took place last night at
Reunion arena is ``man's game.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not for weak-kneed people,'' Hitchcock said. ``It had the
feeling of a sudden death game.''
</P>
<P>
   In final 15 seconds of overtime, both teams had good chances to
go home happy.
</P>
<P>
   First, Stars winger Brett Hull came speeding in on Avalanche
goalie Patrick Roy only to have Colorado defenseman Sandis Ozolinsh
prevent him from getting off a good shot.
</P>
<P>
   The save made, Roy started the play going in the other
direction. Only this time it was Avalanche winger Milan Hejduk
skating alone up the right side and only to have Stars center Mike
Modano get a piece of it at the last second. Stars goalie Ed
Belfour made the save.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first 10 minutes wasn't the greatest hockey, but the last
50 were pretty solid,'' Modano said. ``We had our opportunities,
but Roy and Belfour are two of the top goalies in the league right
now and that's the way it is against those guys.''
</P>
<P>
   Without Belfour, the score could've easily been 4-0 after the
first period. He stopped 12 shots, making the Avs settle for 1-0.
Colorado defenseman Greg De Vries scored at 9:47 of the first
period on a shot that bounced off of Belfour's pad. He finished
with 24 saves.
</P>
<P>
   Roy made 18 saves in all, but really wasn't tested until late in
the second period.
</P>
<P>
   With two minutes remaining in the second period, a pulse was
finally detected on the home team. The line of Scott Thornton,
Brett Hull and Kirk Muller along with defensemen Darryl Sydor and
Sergei Zubov finally put some pressure on Roy.
</P>
<P>
   Three of the Stars nine shots in the period came in the
60-second span that group was on the ice.
</P>
<P>
   The crease, which seats four comfortably, had six players along
with Roy crammed in the little blue space by the time the referee
blew the whistle with 54 seconds remaining in the period.
</P>
<P>
   They created the momentum. Modano capitalized.
</P>
<P>
   He drew a tripping penalty on Colorado defenseman Adam Foote
with 43 seconds remaining in the period. He scored the power-play
goal 13 seconds later.
</P>
<P>
   Stars winger Brett Hull took a shot from the point that
ricocheted to Modano in the circle, who unleashed a wrist shot.
Roy, in the process of changing directions, watched the shot sail
high and in.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a bad break on that goal,'' Roy said. ``It hit two
skates and bounced straight on Modano's stick.''
</P>
<P>
   The third period felt like it was an extension of last season's
Western Conference Finals.
</P>
<P>
   The hitting was fierce. The saves were spectacular. The whistles
were put away. Overtime loomed.
</P>
<P>
   Overtime wasn't any different and didn't decide anything.
</P>
<P>
   ``It shows you when hockey is played tough at that level how
gripping it can be,'' Hitchcock said. ``It was at a whole other
level.''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, February is over. The playoffs have begun.

 MODANO PLAYING LIKE AN ALL-STAR (For use by
NYTimes News Service clients) By GIL LeBRETON c.2000 Fort Worth
Star-Telegram
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ He was an All-Star, and Mike Modano wondered why.
</P>
<P>
   He wasn't playing well, he argued. He wasn't helping his team.
Life after drinking from the Stanley Cup, the star of the Stars
moaned, had turned into a long, lousy burp.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's an emotional guy,'' coach Ken Hitchcock mused last night,
after the Stars' hard-fought, 1-1 knot with the Colorado Avalanche.
</P>
<P>
   ``But he's been playing great. He's been playing really tough,
very tenacious. I think Mo's got a grip on this team, and he's got
a bite on this season right now.''
</P>
<P>
   A bite? For the better part of 25 minutes last night at Reunion
Arena, the Stars seemed all gums. That unofficial Patrick Roy Force
Field was up, discouraging or deflecting the home team's every
advance.
</P>
<P>
   The Avalanche's current malaise _ they've won only twice in
their past 10 games _ has left them desperate and wondering. But as
Hitchcock said, ``They're hungry. Plus, starting tonight, they were
a healthy hockey club.''
</P>
<P>
   When Colorado failed, however, to extend its 1-0 advantage,
Modano was able to nullify the Avalanche's opening two periods of
dominance with one swift, game-tying shot.
</P>
<P>
   If you've been following the Modano saga, the guy who moaned the
woe-is-me's at midseason now has 24 points in his past 17 games. In
the Stars' last six games, he has five goals and three assists.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, the Stars have taken root at the top of the
NHL's Pacific Division. Tell me a better candidate for the league's
Player of the Month award for February.
</P>
<P>
   You can't.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of worrying about who's playing beside him, over the
past month Modano seems to have gotten an infusion of energy from
them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he's enjoying playing hard right now,'' Hitchcock
said.
</P>
<P>
   And for a while, Modano was making it seem like it was all too
hard.
</P>
<P>
   He had a note from the doctor, of course. Several notes. Two
games into the season, on a night when he had already scored two
goals, Anaheim's Ruslan Salei gave Modano an earnest goose toward
the end boards. While Reunion Arena gulped, Modano was immobilized
and carted off on a stretcher.
</P>
<P>
   Somewhat miraculously, the final diagnosis was only a broken
nose, a mild concussion and a damaged ligament in his neck. But as
the team swooned and piled up injuries, Modano's zest for the
season began to droop.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had a couple of chats,'' Hitchcock said. ``Mike got
caught in thinking that the inn at the end of the journey was too
far. He was trying to hope that one game would turn his season
around.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him to go and enjoy the daily stuff. Stop looking too
far ahead. I told him to not try to hit the home run, but to
contribute to the team with hard play.''
</P>
<P>
   After champagne from the Cup, Modano suddenly began to enjoy the
sweat.
</P>
<P>
   For the record, the Stars are 27-6-3 when Modano registers at
least one point in a game. He has again become a leader, which has
been critical with Joe Nieuwendyk, Jere Lehtinen and, until
recently, Derian Hatcher in sick bay.
</P>
<P>
   Hitchcock thinks the Stars' nest of young players has helped as
well _ players such as Brenden Morrow and Kirk Muller.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've given him life,'' Hitchcock said. ``They've got a lot
of energy and grit. I think they've given Mo a lot of juice.''
</P>
<P>
   Fittingly, it was Modano's goal in the dying seconds of the
second period that gave the Stars a psychological wake-up call that
launched a playoff-caliber third period. Then, in the overtime,
after Brett Hull's breakaway on Roy was spoiled at one end, it was
Modano who hustled back to disrupt Joe Sakic's potential
game-winner just enough at the other net.
</P>
<P>
   For the Stars, Hitchcock pronounced it a positive start to what
looms as a week of stern testing. A gantlet of playoff
thoroughbreds awaits the Stars.
</P>
<P>
   ``The good players were good players tonight,'' Hitchcock said,
sounding satisfied with the hard-earned tie.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, Mike Modano was good again. The best player of the month,
in fact.
</P>
<P>
   And this time he's enjoying it.

U.S. FOREIGN POLICY, THE DEMOCRATIC WAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By NORMAN LEVINE  
 c.2000 Special for The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; (LAST IN A SERIES OF THREE ARTICLES. ALSO MOVING IN THE ``A''
CATEGORY  &UR; - RESENDING INHERITING-1, INHERITING-2 AND INHERITING-3
FOR THOSE WHO MAY HAVE MISSED THIS SPECIAL PACKAGE. The author
 &UR; examines the Democratic ``Liberal Moralist'' and ``Liberal
Realist''
 &UR; positions in the debate over the direction of American foreign
policy.)
</P>
<P>
   The American people are undergoing an out-of-body experience:
History is repeating itself, and they have been transferred back to
1920 and the battle waged by Woodrow Wilson and Henry Cabot Lodge
over America's entry into the League of Nations.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson wanted both to make the world ``safe for democracy'' and
for the United States to obey the covenant of the League of
Nations, irrespective of national self-interest. His opponent was
Lodge, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, and
although Lodge favored America's entry into the League, he wished
to modify certain articles as a means of preserving U.S. national
self-interest.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson refused to make any concessions and, in 1920, the League
went down to defeat. The conservatives of 2000 are the spiritual
descendants of Lodge, while present-day liberals inherit the legacy
of Wilson.
</P>
<P>
   As a liberal moralist, Clintonian foreign policy is an amalgam
of Wilson, Jimmy Carter's ``universal human rights'' and reaction
against the Vietnam War with its rejection of unilateral action by
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   After initial hesitation in 1993, Clintonian diplomacy shattered
the boundaries of the containment of Communism theory articulated
by George F. Kennan, a foreign-policy expert and diplomat, at the
beginning of the Cold War. Essentially a strategy to halt further
imperialism of the Stalinist empire, containment theory limited the
extension of American power to the Elbe, which, from 1947 to 1990,
was the eastern border of Germany. &QL; 
NATO EXPANSION &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Clintonian foreign policy committed itself to the enlargement of
the horizon of democracy, and Clinton pursued this goal on two
fronts: expansion of NATO in Europe and support of Boris Yeltsin in
Russia. When Clinton embarked on the jihad of making the world safe
for democracy, he not only embraced this aspect of Wilsonism but
capitulated to the arguments of Anthony Lake, his first national
security adviser.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton Doctrine brought Poland, the Czech Republic and
Hungary into NATO. By including these three countries under the
NATO umbrella, the United States committed itself to the defense of
countries it never previously considered within its own sphere of
national self-interest. This enormous broadening of American
guarantees was justified under the principle of missionary
democracy.
</P>
<P>
   In expanding NATO, Clinton broke American implied agreements
with Mikhail Gorbachev. ``A World Transformed,'' written by George
Bush, who was president at the time of the disintegration of the
Soviet Empire in Eastern Europe, and Brent Scowcroft, Bush's
national security adviser, is unequivocal on this point: At no time
did Bush, Scowcroft, or Secretary of State James Baker indicate to
Gorbachev that NATO would be extended eastward to Poland, the Czech
Republic and Hungary after the Soviets voluntarily renounced their
title to these tracts of land.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. policy toward Yeltsin was another case of missionary
democracy. The Clinton administration adamantly supported Yeltsin
on the grounds that he was leading the democratic capitalist
transformation of Russia.
</P>
<P>
   However, Yeltsin's resignation from office and the crowning of
Vladimir Putin as his successor is a serious setback for the
Clinton doctrine. Putin's recent alliance with the Communists
belies the assertion that democracy is functioning in Russia.
</P>
<P>
   According to Lee Hamilton, Democratic loyalist, respected former
chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, and current
director of the Woodrow Wilson Foundation, Putin's recent coalition
with the Communists ``amounts to a defeat for Clinton, for it
strengthens the power of the Communists in the Duma.'' &QL; 
PUSHING MULTILATERALISM &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Another Wilson ideal that the Clinton doctrine continues is that
American diplomacy should unfold within multilateral institutions.
Liberal moralists are suspicious of unilateral actions because they
fear it will give rise to worldwide anti-Americanism.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of the fact that recent ventures in which America
acted under the aegis of the United Nations _ such as in Somalia,
Bosnia-Herzegovina and Kosovo _ all appear to be failures, the
White House still upholds the usefulness of multilateralism. The
Oval Office fears the bully backlash _ that other nations will
express their resentment against the paramountcy of the United
States by opposing American policies.
</P>
<P>
   Another principle of liberal moralism to which the Clinton
doctrine abides is free trade.
</P>
<P>
   Liberal moralism wishes to turn the movement toward economic
globalization to an advantage for the United States, and so Clinton
has devoted much effort to the reduction of tariffs.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton wishes to use trade as a form of social engineering,
because he hopes that free trade will encourage the growth of a
capitalist entrepreneurial class in countries making the transition
out of communism, like China. Borrowing a phrase from his former
economic adviser, Andrea Tyson, Clinton thinks in terms of
``strategic trade,'' or trade with a deeper purpose than just
making a profit.
</P>
<P>
   In its approach to China, the Clinton doctrine combines the
strategic trade and the ``strategic partner'' approaches.
</P>
<P>
   The theory of the strategic partner is to detach China from any
``anti-hegemonist'' bloc alliance. Primarily, this means preventing
the re-creation of the Cold War Sino-Soviet coalition. &QL; 
OVAL OFFICE'S PLAN &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The hook of strategic trade is associated with the universal
human-rights theory of Carter. By its use of strategic trade, the
Oval Office hopes to ensnare President Jiang Zemin into granting
more ``human rights'' to Chinese citizens. The ultimate aim of
trans-Pacific social engineering is to both speed the development
of a commercial middle class in China and to provide these
entrepreneurs with the protective shield of civil liberties.
</P>
<P>
   Conservatives of all camps attack the Clinton doctrine on China
as a contradiction between rewards and punishments.
</P>
<P>
   Reflecting upon the differences that separate Republicans and
Democrats, Democratic loyalist Hamilton told ``The Arizona
Republic,'' ``Republicans are very skeptical of international
organizations, such as the U.N., the World Trade Organization and
the like. Democrats generally support these multilateral
institutions.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a monopolar world in the social and economic
sense. Even though the U.S. is the only superpower in the military
or `hard' sense, it cannot dictate to all nations of the globe in
matters of gender, children, values or culture. In terms of `soft'
power _ education, information and trade, this is a multipolar
world and the U.S. must learn to act in conjunction with
international organizations.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is important to recognize that the most important lever of
diplomatic power has changed from `hard' to `soft' power. To me,
trade is the crucial issue.'' &QL; 
PARTY SPLIT ON POLICIES &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``The Republicans tend to stress military power,'' Hamilton
added. ``I am an unrepentant free-trader because I believe that
unrestricted trade, from which all sides benefit, is the best way
to export the democratic order.''
</P>
<P>
   But policies are divisive ones within the Democratic Party. To
hold the presidency again in November, Democrats desperately need
the support of American labor, and the AFL-CIO has already endorsed
Vice President Al Gore. Nevertheless, a divorce has taken place
between the corporatist and labor wings of the Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   The corporatists favor strategic trade and China's entry into
the World Trade Organization, because they will be the ``winners''
from the globalization of trade, while Big Labor is opposed to
these policies, because they will be the ``losers'' when domestic
wages are repressed. The Seattle meeting of the World Trade
Organization ended in chaos when Big Labor and environmentalists
led street demonstrations demanding environmental protections, an
end to child labor in China and other Asian countries and
improvement of working conditions before any further reduction of
tariffs.
</P>
<P>
   The issues of China and world trade will be hotly debated along
partisan lines when Congress is called on to approve China's entry
into the World Trade Organization in the fall, and they will play a
major role in the November elections.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has already become a victim of the Democratic dependency on
Big Labor. Gore suffers from a split personality: one face as vice
president and the other as party candidate. As vice president, he
speaks in favor of the Clinton doctrine, but as candidate he must
massage the labor unions.
</P>
<P>
   This past week, Gore's divided personality made the front pages
when the AFL-CIO criticized him for placing the reduction of
tariffs before the increase of wages, the growth of labor unions
and the end of sweat shops in Third World countries.
</P>
<P>
   In spite of Gore's problems with the labor unions, he is also a
Liberal Moralist. In the war of words currently waged in opinion
journals, Stephen M. Walt, a professor of international relations
at Harvard University, has acted as the vice president's script
writer. In an article in the March/April issue of ``Foreign
Affairs,'' Walt has written a Democratic response to the Republican
broadsides that were published by ``Foreign Affairs'' in the
previous issue. The vice president's proxy only proved that on
foreign affairs, Gore is a clone of Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Bradley is also a Liberal Moralist and although there are
no significant differences between Gore and Clinton, there are
important divisions between Gore-Clinton and Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   Gore-Clinton favor an increase in the defense budget, but
Bradley advocates a cut in appropriations for the Defense
Department. Bradley would use the money saved from the military
spending for his domestic agenda such as his health and
anti-poverty programs. Bradley is also far more attuned to the
growing gulf between the cyberspace Atlantic world and the
spinning-wheel Third World.  &QL; 
`BULLY BACKLASH' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Liberal realists, particularly professor Michael Mandelbaum of
the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies, agrees
with Clinton-Gore that it is vital to work within multinational
organizations, but he dissents from the Clinton doctrine on the
issue that America should become a global proselytizer for
democracy.
</P>
<P>
   Mandelbaum led the charge against the expansion of NATO because
he feared the ``bully backlash.'' Mandelbaum's essay, ``Foreign
Policy as Social Work,'' appeared in the January/February 1996
issue of ``Foreign Affairs.'' In the essay, he criticized Clinton
for seeking to turn the United States into the messiah of
constitutional government.
</P>
<P>
   Mandelbaum wrote of Clinton and Lake, his first national
security adviser: ``They tried and failed to turn American foreign
policy into a branch of social work.''
</P>
<P>
   Clintonian foreign policy, Mandelbaum and the entire liberal
realist camp argues, has overextended and overtaxed U.S. resources
around the world. The liberal realists oppose intervention in the
internal affairs of other sovereign states, and they reject the
notion that America can play the world's shrink, using the methods
of a social worker to aid the dysfunctional.
</P>
<P>
   No Republican or Democratic candidate in the current campaign
embraces isolationist or protectionist positions. As the new
century dawns, the United States is experiencing instant historical
replay. The First World War is over, the Treaty of Versailles is
written, and America in 2000 must decide whether it will sign the
League of Nations in 1920.
</P>
<P>
   All those who favor close collaboration with international
organizations, forgoing all instances of unilateral intervention,
will vote for Woodrow Wilson. All those who favor the retention of
full American self-interest, the need for unilateral intervention
to further national security, will vote for Lodge. But whatever
your vote, you must face the consequences: If Americans can put
aside their obsession with the marrying-a- multimillionaire
melodrama, they will bear in mind that history is a life-and-death
sentence, that it repeats itself, and the Second World War followed
the First.  &QL;

   ``This is not a monopolar world in the social and economic
sense. Even though the U.S. is the only superpower in the military
or `hard' sense, it cannot dictate to all nations of the globe in
matters of gender, children, values or culture. In terms of `soft'
power _ education, information and trade, this is a multipolar
world and the U.S. must learn to act in conjunction with
international organizations.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is important to recognize that the most important lever of
diplomatic power has changed from `hard' to `soft' power. To me,
trade is the crucial issue.'' &QL; 
PARTY SPLIT ON POLICIES &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``The Republicans tend to stress military power,'' Hamilton
added. ``I am an unrepentant free-trader because I believe that
unrestricted trade, from which all sides benefit, is the best way
to export the democratic order.''
</P>
<P>
   But policies are divisive ones within the Democratic Party. To
hold the presidency again in November, Democrats desperately need
the support of American labor, and the AFL-CIO has already endorsed
Vice President Al Gore. Nevertheless, a divorce has taken place
between the corporatist and labor wings of the Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   The corporatists favor strategic trade and China's entry into
the World Trade Organization, because they will be the ``winners''
from the globalization of trade, while Big Labor is opposed to
these policies, because they will be the ``losers'' when domestic
wages are repressed. The Seattle meeting of the World Trade
Organization ended in chaos when Big Labor and environmentalists
led street demonstrations demanding environmental protections, an
end to child labor in China and other Asian countries and
improvement of working conditions before any further reduction of
tariffs.
</P>
<P>
   The issues of China and world trade will be hotly debated along
partisan lines when Congress is called on to approve China's entry
into the World Trade Organization in the fall, and they will play a
major role in the November elections.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has already become a victim of the Democratic dependency on
Big Labor. Gore suffers from a split personality: one face as vice
president and the other as party candidate. As vice president, he
speaks in favor of the Clinton doctrine, but as candidate he must
massage the labor unions.
</P>
<P>
   This past week, Gore's divided personality made the front pages
when the AFL-CIO criticized him for placing the reduction of
tariffs before the increase of wages, the growth of labor unions
and the end of sweat shops in Third World countries.
</P>
<P>
   In spite of Gore's problems with the labor unions, he is also a
Liberal Moralist. In the war of words currently waged in opinion
journals, Stephen M. Walt, a professor of international relations
at Harvard University, has acted as the vice president's script
writer. In an article in the March/April issue of ``Foreign
Affairs,'' Walt has written a Democratic response to the Republican
broadsides that were published by ``Foreign Affairs'' in the
previous issue. The vice president's proxy only proved that on
foreign affairs, Gore is a clone of Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Bradley is also a Liberal Moralist and although there are
no significant differences between Gore and Clinton, there are
important divisions between Gore-Clinton and Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   Gore-Clinton favor an increase in the defense budget, but
Bradley advocates a cut in appropriations for the Defense
Department. Bradley would use the money saved from the military
spending for his domestic agenda such as his health and
anti-poverty programs. Bradley is also far more attuned to the
growing gulf between the cyberspace Atlantic world and the
spinning-wheel Third World.  &QL; 
`BULLY BACKLASH' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Liberal realists, particularly professor Michael Mandelbaum of
the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies, agrees
with Clinton-Gore that it is vital to work within multinational
organizations, but he dissents from the Clinton doctrine on the
issue that America should become a global proselytizer for
democracy.
</P>
<P>
   Mandelbaum led the charge against the expansion of NATO because
he feared the ``bully backlash.'' Mandelbaum's essay, ``Foreign
Policy as Social Work,'' appeared in the January/February 1996
issue of ``Foreign Affairs.'' In the essay, he criticized Clinton
for seeking to turn the United States into the messiah of
constitutional government.
</P>
<P>
   Mandelbaum wrote of Clinton and Lake, his first national
security adviser: ``They tried and failed to turn American foreign
policy into a branch of social work.''
</P>
<P>
   Clintonian foreign policy, Mandelbaum and the entire liberal
realist camp argues, has overextended and overtaxed U.S. resources
around the world. The liberal realists oppose intervention in the
internal affairs of other sovereign states, and they reject the
notion that America can play the world's shrink, using the methods
of a social worker to aid the dysfunctional.
</P>
<P>
   No Republican or Democratic candidate in the current campaign
embraces isolationist or protectionist positions. As the new
century dawns, the United States is experiencing instant historical
replay. The First World War is over, the Treaty of Versailles is
written, and America in 2000 must decide whether it will sign the
League of Nations in 1920.
</P>
<P>
   All those who favor close collaboration with international
organizations, forgoing all instances of unilateral intervention,
will vote for Woodrow Wilson. All those who favor the retention of
full American self-interest, the need for unilateral intervention
to further national security, will vote for Lodge. But whatever
your vote, you must face the consequences: If Americans can put
aside their obsession with the marrying-a- multimillionaire
melodrama, they will bear in mind that history is a life-and-death
sentence, that it repeats itself, and the Second World War followed
the First.  &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   In the past hundred years, the United States has had three great
debates over foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
   From 1914 to 1917, President Wilson led the country into World
War I to make the globe ``safe for democracy.''
</P>
<P>
   From 1947 to 1949, America mobilized against Soviet communism,
and George F. Kennan devised the ``containment policy.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, as the nation prepares to select its first president of the
21st century, it has entered its third great debate, and the
question, baldly put, is this: Now that we have inherited the
world, how shall we rule it?
</P>
<P>
   What is at stake in the outcome of this debate is nothing less
than the peace and prosperity of all Americans in the coming
century. Fortunately, America is at peace at the moment, but with
the demise of the Soviet Union as the second-greatest superpower,
many areas of instability and threat have surfaced on international
waters. Terrorism, the proliferation of nuclear, chemical and
biological weapons to rogue states such as Iraq, Iran and North
Korea, the rise of Islamic fundamentalism have brought a series of
mortal challenges to America's doorstep. The United States must
redefine its global role once again, for that act of
self-definition is vital to the security of the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Sadly, it is only every four years, at the time of the
presidential election, that Americans come to face these
life-and-death issues for themselves and for their children.
</P>
<P>
   The conditions in which this discussion takes place are uniquely
different from the 1914-17 and 1947-49 periods. Today, because of
its victory over Politburo totalitarianism, the United States
stands alone as the Earth's only superpower.
</P>
<P>
   The Cold War consensus, based on a bipolar standoff between the
United States and the Soviet Union, has imploded, and in the place
of this consensus a bewildering diversity of opinions has emerged
from the Washington foreign policy elites on how to manage Pax
Americana.
</P>
<P>
   These voices can be grouped into four categories, two
conservative and two liberal.
</P>
<P>
   On the right, the two camps are the Conservative Moralists and
the Conservative Realists. On the left, the two camps are the
Liberal Moralists and the Liberal Realists.
</P>
<P>
   The Dupont Circle area in Washington, D.C., is the miracle mile
of the foreign policy research establishment. Within the 20036 ZIP
code, it is only a five-minute walk among the Johns Hopkins School
of Advanced International Studies (Madeleine Albright's alma
mater), the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace and the
American Enterprise Institute. This is contested turf, a brutal
scrimmage line, for this ZIP code is a kind of foreign policy
football field in which Republican and Democratic advocates block
and tackle fiercely.
</P>
<P>
   Dressed Establishment casual, comfortable in a blue woolen
sweater, Robert Kagan, senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for
International Peace, told ``The Arizona Republic'' in January,
``The United States must be more assertive in advancing the
enlargement of democracy around the globe.''
</P>
<P>
   Kagan and fellow conservative Bill Kristol, editor of the
influential journal the ``Weekly Standard,'' coined the phrase
``benevolent American hegemony'' as a flashcard for their views on
U.S. foreign policy. (``Hegemony'' is code for ``we're in
charge.'')
</P>
<P>
   Kagan and Kristol are the leading exponents of what we will call
the school of Conservative Moralists. A deep strain of moralism
runs through their thinking, because they are unflinching in their
belief that democracy should be the universal form of government,
and they do not shy away from the fact that it may be necessary to
intervene in the affairs of other sovereign states if that is
necessary to bring them the American idea of freedom.
</P>
<P>
   A DAPTING WILSON &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Even though Kagan denies it, the Conservative Moralists are
indebted to the idealism of Woodrow Wilson. One part of Wilsonian
thought was to convince the world of the superiority of democracy,
and this is the part that Kagan and Kristol follow. Another part of
Wilson's thought was the belief that national interests should be
sacrificed to a League of Nations, and both Kagan and Kristol
reject this part.
</P>
<P>
   The school of Conservative Realists, whose most distinguished
practitioner is Henry Kissinger, rejects the moralism of Kagan and
Kristol. All the members of the realist school acknowledge that
democracy is the most desirable form of government, but they deny
that the United States has the missionary purpose of converting the
entire planet to democracy. For this camp, the proper end of
American diplomacy is the preservation of national security.
</P>
<P>
   Kissinger and like-minded policymakers are realists in the sense
that they see the world as made up of competing, self-interested
nations. For them, diplomacy is a jungle. In the spirit of Ronald
Reagan, this group is skeptical about international organizations,
although they see their usefulness. They also draw a line in the
sand between internationalism and the preservation of national
sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
   Conservative Realism is a doctrine that favors unilateral action
to defend the national self-interest of the United States. It
doubts the effectiveness of multilateral action _ for example, the
U.N. peacekeeping mission in Bosnia, which is widely acknowledged
to be a failure. The members of this school argue that the
multinational United Nations never has demonstrated its ability to
efficiently carry out its peacekeeping responsibilities.
</P>
<P>
   Straight and elegant, her mind as sharp as a quarterback in a
fourth-and-one-situation, Jeane Kirkpatrick, ambassador to the
United Nations under Ronald Reagan and now a professor at
Georgetown University and senior fellow at the American Enterprise
Institute, disagrees with the Kagan-Kristol School. A strong voice
within the conservative movement, Kirkpatrick doubts that democracy
can be spread through interventionist methods.
</P>
<P>
   REAGAN'S WAY &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Ronald Reagan, whom I admired as a great president,''
Kirkpatrick said, ``understood the sanctity of national
independence. The U.N. is a useful tool. All international
organizations are useful tools. I am not opposed to the U.N. But
one principle that Reagan stood by, and that I stand by, is that
the U.S. must never surrender its sovereignty or national
self-interests to any international organization.''
</P>
<P>
   The foreign policy agenda of the Republican Party is made up of
both Conservative Moralists and Realists. Gov. George W. Bush
himself stands squarely in the faction of Conservative Realism.
Many members of the realist school, including Condoleezza (EDITORS:
CORRECT) Rice, Elliot Abrams, Richard Perle and Paul Wolfowitz
(EDITORS: CORRECT) (all of whom held high foreign policy positions
in either the Reagan or Bush administrations), are currently
advisers to the present Bush presidential campaign. John McCain is
also a Conservative Realist, and one of his foreign policy advisers
is Henry Kissinger. Neither the Conservative Moralists nor Realists
are isolationists.
</P>
<P>
   The liberal Establishment also fields a team within the 20036
ZIP-code playing field, and the expertise of the Brookings
Institute is certainly playoff quality. Although it is primarily a
research center for scholars from all over the world, and as such
its public image must be as objective, the Woodrow Wilson Center,
yards away from the Dupont Circle, currently is headed by Lee
Hamilton, who presented to ``The Republic'' the arguments of the
Liberal Moralists.
</P>
<P>
   A Democrat and former member of Congress, Hamilton was chairman
of the House Foreign Relations Committee. Stately, and possessed of
a typical Hoosier friendliness, Hamilton said, ``The Republicans
are too quick to defend unilateral intervention. Even though
international organizations are imperfect, America must learn to
work in cooperation with them.''
</P>
<P>
   CARTER LEGACY &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The political heritage of the Liberal Moralists grows out of the
unusual alliance among Wilson, Jimmy Carter and Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   From Wilson, the Liberal Moralists take the ideas of the
dissemination of democracy, as well as a commitment to collective
security and internationalism. From Jimmy Carter, they borrow the
dogma of universal human rights, which includes the rights of
women, children and labor.
</P>
<P>
   The war in Vietnam served as a bloody lesson that the arrogant,
unilateral exercise of U.S. power can produce the diplomatic
isolation of the United States. Like the Conservative Moralists,
Liberal Moralists also advocate an expansive role for democracy and
the capitalist system. Unlike both the Conservative Moralists and
Realists, the Liberal Moralists are suspicious of unilateral
intervention as a means of disseminating democracy and human
rights. Liberal Moralists prefer to act within multilateral
institutions, such as the United Nations. For example, Liberal
Moralists favor humanitarian intervention under the umbrella of the
United Nations. The American involvement in Kosovo is presented as
a model of humanitarian intervention, for in this case the United
States became engaged to prevent the continued slaughter of
Kosovars, but under the aegis of the multilateral United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   Recognizing that globalization was one of the dominant
tendencies of the last decade of the 20th century, Liberal
Moralists are free-traders. A large corporatist faction exists
within Liberal Moralists, because multinational corporations see
the opportunity to harvest huge profits from the
internationalization of trade.
</P>
<P>
   Liberal Realists speak the language of national self-interest
and not the tongue of democratic moralism. Like the Conservative
Realists, their brethren the Liberal Realists take a dim view of
the idea that the purpose of American diplomacy is the conversion
of the globe to democracy. They also view the goal of international
relations as the preservation of American nationhood.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike their conservative brethren, however, Liberal Realists
perceive contemporary international relations as multipolar. They
stress the importance of the United States' working in harmony with
multilateral organizations because they see the danger of causing a
reaction against the American imperium. If the United States were
to pursue a unilateralist course of action, the Liberal Realists
argue, this would result in the undesirable development of an
``anti-hegemonist'' camp _ the alliance of Russia, China and Iran
to halt American primacy.
</P>
<P>
   CLINTON OPPOSED &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The most prominent members of the Liberal Realist camp are three
academicians: Professors Michael Mandelbaum and Robert W. Tucker
(emeritus) of the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International
Studies and Professor Ronald Steel of the University of
California-Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   True to their belief that America must show great restraint
before exercising unilateral action, the Liberal Realists opposed
the Clinton policy of NATO expansion. Mandelbaum's book ``The Dawn
of Peace in Europe'' is the classic statement against the need for
NATO enlargement on the grounds that it would drive Russia and
China together. Tucker's book ``The Imperialist Temptation''
criticized President Bush's Operation Desert Storm because it
represented U.S. overreach, extending U.S. responsibilities from
Western Europe, the original site of the American-Soviet standoff,
to the Persian Gulf, a colossal stretch of American national
interests.
</P>
<P>
   Clintonian foreign policy is an outgrowth of Liberal Moralism.
Although there are significant differences in terms of their
foreign policy, both Al Gore and Bill Bradley are members of the
Liberal Moralist wing of the Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   The grand foreign policy debate of the new millennium, the
search for the Second Coming of George F. Kennan, is essentially an
in-house dialogue among inhabitants of the Washington policy think
tanks. During the Kosovo entanglement the American people were
activated by TV war imagery to think about America's role in the
world, but Kosovo is over, and Americans again have turned their
gaze inward. It is Social Security, medical insurance, education
and taxes that consume their interest in this election year and not
``ethnic cleansing.''
</P>
<P>
   As Norman Ornstein, a specialist on Congress at the American
Enterprise Institute, pointed out, ``63 percent of the House of
Representatives were elected after the fall of communism.'' The
amount of money spent on agencies in the U.S. government dealing
with foreign affairs has been cut by Congress. The amount of money
given to international organizations also has been diminished. It
is truly a new world.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not that Congress is isolationist,'' Ornstein suggested,
``it is rather that Congress is insular. Domestic needs have taken
priority.''
</P>
<P>
   Unless there is a terrorist act of great bestiality, unless the
TV screen can show decapitated bodies and mangled limbs, Americans
will elect their first chief executive of the new century on issues
relating to homosexuality and abortion rather than on this
transformative moment of how the U.S. colossus should behave in the
world after it inherited this wondrous sphere.  &QL;

research center for scholars from all over the world, and as such
its public image must be as objective, the Woodrow Wilson Center,
yards away from the Dupont Circle, currently is headed by Lee
Hamilton, who presented to ``The Republic'' the arguments of the
Liberal Moralists.
</P>
<P>
   A Democrat and former member of Congress, Hamilton was chairman
of the House Foreign Relations Committee. Stately, and possessed of
a typical Hoosier friendliness, Hamilton said, ``The Republicans
are too quick to defend unilateral intervention. Even though
international organizations are imperfect, America must learn to
work in cooperation with them.''
</P>
<P>
   CARTER LEGACY &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The political heritage of the Liberal Moralists grows out of the
unusual alliance among Wilson, Jimmy Carter and Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   From Wilson, the Liberal Moralists take the ideas of the
dissemination of democracy, as well as a commitment to collective
security and internationalism. From Jimmy Carter, they borrow the
dogma of universal human rights, which includes the rights of
women, children and labor.
</P>
<P>
   The war in Vietnam served as a bloody lesson that the arrogant,
unilateral exercise of U.S. power can produce the diplomatic
isolation of the United States. Like the Conservative Moralists,
Liberal Moralists also advocate an expansive role for democracy and
the capitalist system. Unlike both the Conservative Moralists and
Realists, the Liberal Moralists are suspicious of unilateral
intervention as a means of disseminating democracy and human
rights. Liberal Moralists prefer to act within multilateral
institutions, such as the United Nations. For example, Liberal
Moralists favor humanitarian intervention under the umbrella of the
United Nations. The American involvement in Kosovo is presented as
a model of humanitarian intervention, for in this case the United
States became engaged to prevent the continued slaughter of
Kosovars, but under the aegis of the multilateral United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   Recognizing that globalization was one of the dominant
tendencies of the last decade of the 20th century, Liberal
Moralists are free-traders. A large corporatist faction exists
within Liberal Moralists, because multinational corporations see
the opportunity to harvest huge profits from the
internationalization of trade.
</P>
<P>
   Liberal Realists speak the language of national self-interest
and not the tongue of democratic moralism. Like the Conservative
Realists, their brethren the Liberal Realists take a dim view of
the idea that the purpose of American diplomacy is the conversion
of the globe to democracy. They also view the goal of international
relations as the preservation of American nationhood.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike their conservative brethren, however, Liberal Realists
perceive contemporary international relations as multipolar. They
stress the importance of the United States' working in harmony with
multilateral organizations because they see the danger of causing a
reaction against the American imperium. If the United States were
to pursue a unilateralist course of action, the Liberal Realists
argue, this would result in the undesirable development of an
``anti-hegemonist'' camp _ the alliance of Russia, China and Iran
to halt American primacy.
</P>
<P>
   CLINTON OPPOSED &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The most prominent members of the Liberal Realist camp are three
academicians: Professors Michael Mandelbaum and Robert W. Tucker
(emeritus) of the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International
Studies and Professor Ronald Steel of the University of
California-Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   True to their belief that America must show great restraint
before exercising unilateral action, the Liberal Realists opposed
the Clinton policy of NATO expansion. Mandelbaum's book ``The Dawn
of Peace in Europe'' is the classic statement against the need for
NATO enlargement on the grounds that it would drive Russia and
China together. Tucker's book ``The Imperialist Temptation''
criticized President Bush's Operation Desert Storm because it
represented U.S. overreach, extending U.S. responsibilities from
Western Europe, the original site of the American-Soviet standoff,
to the Persian Gulf, a colossal stretch of American national
interests.
</P>
<P>
   Clintonian foreign policy is an outgrowth of Liberal Moralism.
Although there are significant differences in terms of their
foreign policy, both Al Gore and Bill Bradley are members of the
Liberal Moralist wing of the Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   The grand foreign policy debate of the new millennium, the
search for the Second Coming of George F. Kennan, is essentially an
in-house dialogue among inhabitants of the Washington policy think
tanks. During the Kosovo entanglement the American people were
activated by TV war imagery to think about America's role in the
world, but Kosovo is over, and Americans again have turned their
gaze inward. It is Social Security, medical insurance, education
and taxes that consume their interest in this election year and not
``ethnic cleansing.''
</P>
<P>
   As Norman Ornstein, a specialist on Congress at the American
Enterprise Institute, pointed out, ``63 percent of the House of
Representatives were elected after the fall of communism.'' The
amount of money spent on agencies in the U.S. government dealing
with foreign affairs has been cut by Congress. The amount of money
given to international organizations also has been diminished. It
is truly a new world.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not that Congress is isolationist,'' Ornstein suggested,
``it is rather that Congress is insular. Domestic needs have taken
priority.''
</P>
<P>
   Unless there is a terrorist act of great bestiality, unless the
TV screen can show decapitated bodies and mangled limbs, Americans
will elect their first chief executive of the new century on issues
relating to homosexuality and abortion rather than on this
transformative moment of how the U.S. colossus should behave in the
world after it inherited this wondrous sphere.  &QL;

U.S. FOREIGN POLICY, THE DEMOCRATIC WAY

 c.2000 Special for The Arizona Republic

<P>
   &UR; (LAST IN A SERIES OF THREE ARTICLES. ALSO MOVING IN THE ``A''
CATEGORY  &UR; - RESENDING INHERITING-1, INHERITING-2 AND INHERITING-3
FOR THOSE WHO MAY HAVE MISSED THIS SPECIAL PACKAGE. The author
 &UR; examines the Democratic ``Liberal Moralist'' and ``Liberal
Realist''
 &UR; positions in the debate over the direction of American foreign
policy.)
</P>
<P>
   The American people are undergoing an out-of-body experience:
History is repeating itself, and they have been transferred back to
1920 and the battle waged by Woodrow Wilson and Henry Cabot Lodge
over America's entry into the League of Nations.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson wanted both to make the world ``safe for democracy'' and
for the United States to obey the covenant of the League of
Nations, irrespective of national self-interest. His opponent was
Lodge, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, and
although Lodge favored America's entry into the League, he wished
to modify certain articles as a means of preserving U.S. national
self-interest.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson refused to make any concessions and, in 1920, the League
went down to defeat. The conservatives of 2000 are the spiritual
descendants of Lodge, while present-day liberals inherit the legacy
of Wilson.
</P>
<P>
   As a liberal moralist, Clintonian foreign policy is an amalgam
of Wilson, Jimmy Carter's ``universal human rights'' and reaction
against the Vietnam War with its rejection of unilateral action by
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   After initial hesitation in 1993, Clintonian diplomacy shattered
the boundaries of the containment of Communism theory articulated
by George F. Kennan, a foreign-policy expert and diplomat, at the
beginning of the Cold War. Essentially a strategy to halt further
imperialism of the Stalinist empire, containment theory limited the
extension of American power to the Elbe, which, from 1947 to 1990,
was the eastern border of Germany. &QL; 
NATO EXPANSION &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Clintonian foreign policy committed itself to the enlargement of
the horizon of democracy, and Clinton pursued this goal on two
fronts: expansion of NATO in Europe and support of Boris Yeltsin in
Russia. When Clinton embarked on the jihad of making the world safe
for democracy, he not only embraced this aspect of Wilsonism but
capitulated to the arguments of Anthony Lake, his first national
security adviser.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton Doctrine brought Poland, the Czech Republic and
Hungary into NATO. By including these three countries under the
NATO umbrella, the United States committed itself to the defense of
countries it never previously considered within its own sphere of
national self-interest. This enormous broadening of American
guarantees was justified under the principle of missionary
democracy.
</P>
<P>
   In expanding NATO, Clinton broke American implied agreements
with Mikhail Gorbachev. ``A World Transformed,'' written by George
Bush, who was president at the time of the disintegration of the
Soviet Empire in Eastern Europe, and Brent Scowcroft, Bush's
national security adviser, is unequivocal on this point: At no time
did Bush, Scowcroft, or Secretary of State James Baker indicate to
Gorbachev that NATO would be extended eastward to Poland, the Czech
Republic and Hungary after the Soviets voluntarily renounced their
title to these tracts of land.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. policy toward Yeltsin was another case of missionary
democracy. The Clinton administration adamantly supported Yeltsin
on the grounds that he was leading the democratic capitalist
transformation of Russia.
</P>
<P>
   However, Yeltsin's resignation from office and the crowning of
Vladimir Putin as his successor is a serious setback for the
Clinton doctrine. Putin's recent alliance with the Communists
belies the assertion that democracy is functioning in Russia.
</P>
<P>
   According to Lee Hamilton, Democratic loyalist, respected former
chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, and current
director of the Woodrow Wilson Foundation, Putin's recent coalition
with the Communists ``amounts to a defeat for Clinton, for it
strengthens the power of the Communists in the Duma.'' &QL; 
PUSHING MULTILATERALISM &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Another Wilson ideal that the Clinton doctrine continues is that
American diplomacy should unfold within multilateral institutions.
Liberal moralists are suspicious of unilateral actions because they
fear it will give rise to worldwide anti-Americanism.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of the fact that recent ventures in which America
acted under the aegis of the United Nations _ such as in Somalia,
Bosnia-Herzegovina and Kosovo _ all appear to be failures, the
White House still upholds the usefulness of multilateralism. The
Oval Office fears the bully backlash _ that other nations will
express their resentment against the paramountcy of the United
States by opposing American policies.
</P>
<P>
   Another principle of liberal moralism to which the Clinton
doctrine abides is free trade.
</P>
<P>
   Liberal moralism wishes to turn the movement toward economic
globalization to an advantage for the United States, and so Clinton
has devoted much effort to the reduction of tariffs.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton wishes to use trade as a form of social engineering,
because he hopes that free trade will encourage the growth of a
capitalist entrepreneurial class in countries making the transition
out of communism, like China. Borrowing a phrase from his former
economic adviser, Andrea Tyson, Clinton thinks in terms of
``strategic trade,'' or trade with a deeper purpose than just
making a profit.
</P>
<P>
   In its approach to China, the Clinton doctrine combines the
strategic trade and the ``strategic partner'' approaches.
</P>
<P>
   The theory of the strategic partner is to detach China from any
``anti-hegemonist'' bloc alliance. Primarily, this means preventing
the re-creation of the Cold War Sino-Soviet coalition. &QL; 
OVAL OFFICE'S PLAN &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The hook of strategic trade is associated with the universal
human-rights theory of Carter. By its use of strategic trade, the
Oval Office hopes to ensnare President Jiang Zemin into granting
more ``human rights'' to Chinese citizens. The ultimate aim of
trans-Pacific social engineering is to both speed the development
of a commercial middle class in China and to provide these
entrepreneurs with the protective shield of civil liberties.
</P>
<P>
   Conservatives of all camps attack the Clinton doctrine on China
as a contradiction between rewards and punishments.
</P>
<P>
   Reflecting upon the differences that separate Republicans and
Democrats, Democratic loyalist Hamilton told ``The Arizona
Republic,'' ``Republicans are very skeptical of international
organizations, such as the U.N., the World Trade Organization and
the like. Democrats generally support these multilateral
institutions.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a monopolar world in the social and economic
sense. Even though the U.S. is the only superpower in the military
or `hard' sense, it cannot dictate to all nations of the globe in
matters of gender, children, values or culture. In terms of `soft'
power _ education, information and trade, this is a multipolar
world and the U.S. must learn to act in conjunction with
international organizations.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is important to recognize that the most important lever of
diplomatic power has changed from `hard' to `soft' power. To me,
trade is the crucial issue.'' &QL; 
PARTY SPLIT ON POLICIES &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``The Republicans tend to stress military power,'' Hamilton
added. ``I am an unrepentant free-trader because I believe that
unrestricted trade, from which all sides benefit, is the best way
to export the democratic order.''
</P>
<P>
   But policies are divisive ones within the Democratic Party. To
hold the presidency again in November, Democrats desperately need
the support of American labor, and the AFL-CIO has already endorsed
Vice President Al Gore. Nevertheless, a divorce has taken place
between the corporatist and labor wings of the Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   The corporatists favor strategic trade and China's entry into
the World Trade Organization, because they will be the ``winners''
from the globalization of trade, while Big Labor is opposed to
these policies, because they will be the ``losers'' when domestic
wages are repressed. The Seattle meeting of the World Trade
Organization ended in chaos when Big Labor and environmentalists
led street demonstrations demanding environmental protections, an
end to child labor in China and other Asian countries and
improvement of working conditions before any further reduction of
tariffs.
</P>
<P>
   The issues of China and world trade will be hotly debated along
partisan lines when Congress is called on to approve China's entry
into the World Trade Organization in the fall, and they will play a
major role in the November elections.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has already become a victim of the Democratic dependency on
Big Labor. Gore suffers from a split personality: one face as vice
president and the other as party candidate. As vice president, he
speaks in favor of the Clinton doctrine, but as candidate he must
massage the labor unions.
</P>
<P>
   This past week, Gore's divided personality made the front pages
when the AFL-CIO criticized him for placing the reduction of
tariffs before the increase of wages, the growth of labor unions
and the end of sweat shops in Third World countries.
</P>
<P>
   In spite of Gore's problems with the labor unions, he is also a
Liberal Moralist. In the war of words currently waged in opinion
journals, Stephen M. Walt, a professor of international relations
at Harvard University, has acted as the vice president's script
writer. In an article in the March/April issue of ``Foreign
Affairs,'' Walt has written a Democratic response to the Republican
broadsides that were published by ``Foreign Affairs'' in the
previous issue. The vice president's proxy only proved that on
foreign affairs, Gore is a clone of Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Bradley is also a Liberal Moralist and although there are
no significant differences between Gore and Clinton, there are
important divisions between Gore-Clinton and Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   Gore-Clinton favor an increase in the defense budget, but
Bradley advocates a cut in appropriations for the Defense
Department. Bradley would use the money saved from the military
spending for his domestic agenda such as his health and
anti-poverty programs. Bradley is also far more attuned to the
growing gulf between the cyberspace Atlantic world and the
spinning-wheel Third World.  &QL; 
`BULLY BACKLASH' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Liberal realists, particularly professor Michael Mandelbaum of
the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies, agrees
with Clinton-Gore that it is vital to work within multinational
organizations, but he dissents from the Clinton doctrine on the
issue that America should become a global proselytizer for
democracy.
</P>
<P>
   Mandelbaum led the charge against the expansion of NATO because
he feared the ``bully backlash.'' Mandelbaum's essay, ``Foreign
Policy as Social Work,'' appeared in the January/February 1996
issue of ``Foreign Affairs.'' In the essay, he criticized Clinton
for seeking to turn the United States into the messiah of
constitutional government.
</P>
<P>
   Mandelbaum wrote of Clinton and Lake, his first national
security adviser: ``They tried and failed to turn American foreign
policy into a branch of social work.''
</P>
<P>
   Clintonian foreign policy, Mandelbaum and the entire liberal
realist camp argues, has overextended and overtaxed U.S. resources
around the world. The liberal realists oppose intervention in the
internal affairs of other sovereign states, and they reject the
notion that America can play the world's shrink, using the methods
of a social worker to aid the dysfunctional.
</P>
<P>
   No Republican or Democratic candidate in the current campaign
embraces isolationist or protectionist positions. As the new
century dawns, the United States is experiencing instant historical
replay. The First World War is over, the Treaty of Versailles is
written, and America in 2000 must decide whether it will sign the
League of Nations in 1920.
</P>
<P>
   All those who favor close collaboration with international
organizations, forgoing all instances of unilateral intervention,
will vote for Woodrow Wilson. All those who favor the retention of
full American self-interest, the need for unilateral intervention
to further national security, will vote for Lodge. But whatever
your vote, you must face the consequences: If Americans can put
aside their obsession with the marrying-a- multimillionaire
melodrama, they will bear in mind that history is a life-and-death
sentence, that it repeats itself, and the Second World War followed
the First.  &QL;

INHERITING THE WORLD: AMERICAN FOREIGN POLICY AFTER THE COLD WAR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By NORMAN LEVINE  
 c.2000 Special for The Arizona Republic  
 ALSO MOVING IN THE ``K'' CATEGORY 
 RETRANSMITTING INHERITING-1, INHERITING-2 and INHERITING-3 FOR
THOSE WHO MIGHT HAVE MISSED THIS SPECIAL PACKAGE BY NORMAN LEVINE 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the past hundred years, the United States has had three great
debates over foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
   From 1914 to 1917, President Wilson led the country into World
War I to make the globe ``safe for democracy.''
</P>
<P>
   From 1947 to 1949, America mobilized against Soviet communism,
and George F. Kennan devised the ``containment policy.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, as the nation prepares to select its first president of the
21st century, it has entered its third great debate, and the
question, baldly put, is this: Now that we have inherited the
world, how shall we rule it?
</P>
<P>
   What is at stake in the outcome of this debate is nothing less
than the peace and prosperity of all Americans in the coming
century. Fortunately, America is at peace at the moment, but with
the demise of the Soviet Union as the second-greatest superpower,
many areas of instability and threat have surfaced on international
waters. Terrorism, the proliferation of nuclear, chemical and
biological weapons to rogue states such as Iraq, Iran and North
Korea, the rise of Islamic fundamentalism have brought a series of
mortal challenges to America's doorstep. The United States must
redefine its global role once again, for that act of
self-definition is vital to the security of the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Sadly, it is only every four years, at the time of the
presidential election, that Americans come to face these
life-and-death issues for themselves and for their children.
</P>
<P>
   The conditions in which this discussion takes place are uniquely
different from the 1914-17 and 1947-49 periods. Today, because of
its victory over Politburo totalitarianism, the United States
stands alone as the Earth's only superpower.
</P>
<P>
   The Cold War consensus, based on a bipolar standoff between the
United States and the Soviet Union, has imploded, and in the place
of this consensus a bewildering diversity of opinions has emerged
from the Washington foreign policy elites on how to manage Pax
Americana.
</P>
<P>
   These voices can be grouped into four categories, two
conservative and two liberal.
</P>
<P>
   On the right, the two camps are the Conservative Moralists and
the Conservative Realists. On the left, the two camps are the
Liberal Moralists and the Liberal Realists.
</P>
<P>
   The Dupont Circle area in Washington, D.C., is the miracle mile
of the foreign policy research establishment. Within the 20036 ZIP
code, it is only a five-minute walk among the Johns Hopkins School
of Advanced International Studies (Madeleine Albright's alma
mater), the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace and the
American Enterprise Institute. This is contested turf, a brutal
scrimmage line, for this ZIP code is a kind of foreign policy
football field in which Republican and Democratic advocates block
and tackle fiercely.
</P>
<P>
   Dressed Establishment casual, comfortable in a blue woolen
sweater, Robert Kagan, senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for
International Peace, told ``The Arizona Republic'' in January,
``The United States must be more assertive in advancing the
enlargement of democracy around the globe.''
</P>
<P>
   Kagan and fellow conservative Bill Kristol, editor of the
influential journal the ``Weekly Standard,'' coined the phrase
``benevolent American hegemony'' as a flashcard for their views on
U.S. foreign policy. (``Hegemony'' is code for ``we're in
charge.'')
</P>
<P>
   Kagan and Kristol are the leading exponents of what we will call
the school of Conservative Moralists. A deep strain of moralism
runs through their thinking, because they are unflinching in their
belief that democracy should be the universal form of government,
and they do not shy away from the fact that it may be necessary to
intervene in the affairs of other sovereign states if that is
necessary to bring them the American idea of freedom.
</P>
<P>
   A DAPTING WILSON &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Even though Kagan denies it, the Conservative Moralists are
indebted to the idealism of Woodrow Wilson. One part of Wilsonian
thought was to convince the world of the superiority of democracy,
and this is the part that Kagan and Kristol follow. Another part of
Wilson's thought was the belief that national interests should be
sacrificed to a League of Nations, and both Kagan and Kristol
reject this part.
</P>
<P>
   The school of Conservative Realists, whose most distinguished
practitioner is Henry Kissinger, rejects the moralism of Kagan and
Kristol. All the members of the realist school acknowledge that
democracy is the most desirable form of government, but they deny
that the United States has the missionary purpose of converting the
entire planet to democracy. For this camp, the proper end of
American diplomacy is the preservation of national security.
</P>
<P>
   Kissinger and like-minded policymakers are realists in the sense
that they see the world as made up of competing, self-interested
nations. For them, diplomacy is a jungle. In the spirit of Ronald
Reagan, this group is skeptical about international organizations,
although they see their usefulness. They also draw a line in the
sand between internationalism and the preservation of national
sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
   Conservative Realism is a doctrine that favors unilateral action
to defend the national self-interest of the United States. It
doubts the effectiveness of multilateral action _ for example, the
U.N. peacekeeping mission in Bosnia, which is widely acknowledged
to be a failure. The members of this school argue that the
multinational United Nations never has demonstrated its ability to
efficiently carry out its peacekeeping responsibilities.
</P>
<P>
   Straight and elegant, her mind as sharp as a quarterback in a
fourth-and-one-situation, Jeane Kirkpatrick, ambassador to the
United Nations under Ronald Reagan and now a professor at
Georgetown University and senior fellow at the American Enterprise
Institute, disagrees with the Kagan-Kristol School. A strong voice
within the conservative movement, Kirkpatrick doubts that democracy
can be spread through interventionist methods.
</P>
<P>
   REAGAN'S WAY &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Ronald Reagan, whom I admired as a great president,''
Kirkpatrick said, ``understood the sanctity of national
independence. The U.N. is a useful tool. All international
organizations are useful tools. I am not opposed to the U.N. But
one principle that Reagan stood by, and that I stand by, is that
the U.S. must never surrender its sovereignty or national
self-interests to any international organization.''
</P>
<P>
   The foreign policy agenda of the Republican Party is made up of
both Conservative Moralists and Realists. Gov. George W. Bush
himself stands squarely in the faction of Conservative Realism.
Many members of the realist school, including Condoleezza (EDITORS:
CORRECT) Rice, Elliot Abrams, Richard Perle and Paul Wolfowitz
(EDITORS: CORRECT) (all of whom held high foreign policy positions
in either the Reagan or Bush administrations), are currently
advisers to the present Bush presidential campaign. John McCain is
also a Conservative Realist, and one of his foreign policy advisers
is Henry Kissinger. Neither the Conservative Moralists nor Realists
are isolationists.
</P>
<P>
   The liberal Establishment also fields a team within the 20036
ZIP-code playing field, and the expertise of the Brookings
Institute is certainly playoff quality. Although it is primarily a
research center for scholars from all over the world, and as such
its public image must be as objective, the Woodrow Wilson Center,
yards away from the Dupont Circle, currently is headed by Lee
Hamilton, who presented to ``The Republic'' the arguments of the
Liberal Moralists.
</P>
<P>
   A Democrat and former member of Congress, Hamilton was chairman
of the House Foreign Relations Committee. Stately, and possessed of
a typical Hoosier friendliness, Hamilton said, ``The Republicans
are too quick to defend unilateral intervention. Even though
international organizations are imperfect, America must learn to
work in cooperation with them.''
</P>
<P>
   CARTER LEGACY &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The political heritage of the Liberal Moralists grows out of the
unusual alliance among Wilson, Jimmy Carter and Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   From Wilson, the Liberal Moralists take the ideas of the
dissemination of democracy, as well as a commitment to collective
security and internationalism. From Jimmy Carter, they borrow the
dogma of universal human rights, which includes the rights of
women, children and labor.
</P>
<P>
   The war in Vietnam served as a bloody lesson that the arrogant,
unilateral exercise of U.S. power can produce the diplomatic
isolation of the United States. Like the Conservative Moralists,
Liberal Moralists also advocate an expansive role for democracy and
the capitalist system. Unlike both the Conservative Moralists and
Realists, the Liberal Moralists are suspicious of unilateral
intervention as a means of disseminating democracy and human
rights. Liberal Moralists prefer to act within multilateral
institutions, such as the United Nations. For example, Liberal
Moralists favor humanitarian intervention under the umbrella of the
United Nations. The American involvement in Kosovo is presented as
a model of humanitarian intervention, for in this case the United
States became engaged to prevent the continued slaughter of
Kosovars, but under the aegis of the multilateral United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   Recognizing that globalization was one of the dominant
tendencies of the last decade of the 20th century, Liberal
Moralists are free-traders. A large corporatist faction exists
within Liberal Moralists, because multinational corporations see
the opportunity to harvest huge profits from the
internationalization of trade.
</P>
<P>
   Liberal Realists speak the language of national self-interest
and not the tongue of democratic moralism. Like the Conservative
Realists, their brethren the Liberal Realists take a dim view of
the idea that the purpose of American diplomacy is the conversion
of the globe to democracy. They also view the goal of international
relations as the preservation of American nationhood.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike their conservative brethren, however, Liberal Realists
perceive contemporary international relations as multipolar. They
stress the importance of the United States' working in harmony with
multilateral organizations because they see the danger of causing a
reaction against the American imperium. If the United States were
to pursue a unilateralist course of action, the Liberal Realists
argue, this would result in the undesirable development of an
``anti-hegemonist'' camp _ the alliance of Russia, China and Iran
to halt American primacy.
</P>
<P>
   CLINTON OPPOSED &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The most prominent members of the Liberal Realist camp are three
academicians: Professors Michael Mandelbaum and Robert W. Tucker
(emeritus) of the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International
Studies and Professor Ronald Steel of the University of
California-Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   True to their belief that America must show great restraint
before exercising unilateral action, the Liberal Realists opposed
the Clinton policy of NATO expansion. Mandelbaum's book ``The Dawn
of Peace in Europe'' is the classic statement against the need for
NATO enlargement on the grounds that it would drive Russia and
China together. Tucker's book ``The Imperialist Temptation''
criticized President Bush's Operation Desert Storm because it
represented U.S. overreach, extending U.S. responsibilities from
Western Europe, the original site of the American-Soviet standoff,
to the Persian Gulf, a colossal stretch of American national
interests.
</P>
<P>
   Clintonian foreign policy is an outgrowth of Liberal Moralism.
Although there are significant differences in terms of their
foreign policy, both Al Gore and Bill Bradley are members of the
Liberal Moralist wing of the Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   The grand foreign policy debate of the new millennium, the
search for the Second Coming of George F. Kennan, is essentially an
in-house dialogue among inhabitants of the Washington policy think
tanks. During the Kosovo entanglement the American people were
activated by TV war imagery to think about America's role in the
world, but Kosovo is over, and Americans again have turned their
gaze inward. It is Social Security, medical insurance, education
and taxes that consume their interest in this election year and not
``ethnic cleansing.''
</P>
<P>
   As Norman Ornstein, a specialist on Congress at the American
Enterprise Institute, pointed out, ``63 percent of the House of
Representatives were elected after the fall of communism.'' The
amount of money spent on agencies in the U.S. government dealing
with foreign affairs has been cut by Congress. The amount of money
given to international organizations also has been diminished. It
is truly a new world.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not that Congress is isolationist,'' Ornstein suggested,
``it is rather that Congress is insular. Domestic needs have taken
priority.''
</P>
<P>
   Unless there is a terrorist act of great bestiality, unless the
TV screen can show decapitated bodies and mangled limbs, Americans
will elect their first chief executive of the new century on issues
relating to homosexuality and abortion rather than on this
transformative moment of how the U.S. colossus should behave in the
world after it inherited this wondrous sphere.  &QL;

 MATCH PLAY-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM MCCABE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CARLSBAD, Calif. _ It is a look that the golf world has come to
recognize, a stare that could melt ice more quickly than the desert
sun.
</P>
<P>
   The Tiger Woods stare.
</P>
<P>
   Only Sunday it belonged to Darren Clarke. ``He looked Tiger
Woods right in the eye and said, `I'm gonna kick your butt.' And he
did, too,'' said Butch Harmon, the swing coach to both players who
was among those who could not quite believe what had just happened
at La Costa Resort and Spa in the Andersen Consulting Match Play
Championship final.
</P>
<P>
   Clarke, previously regarded as a gentle sort who believed in
living well more than in his golfing skills, put a 4-and-3 drubbing
on Woods that earned him $1 million, though its true worth may be
priceless. ``If he can't believe he's a great player now . . .''
said Andrew Chandler, who has managed Clarke's career since the
native of Dungannon, Northern Ireland, turned pro in 1990, and who
has striven to convince the golfer ever since of his talents.
</P>
<P>
   That should change, said Chandler, because Clarke never blinked,
never wavered, never came close to even a scent of intimidation. He
conceded Woods's superiority off the tee, but saw it as a positive.
``I think Tiger's length was to my benefit,'' said Clarke, 31. ``It
gave me an opportunity to be hitting into the greens first, so as
soon as I got in there close, that resulted in pressure for
Tiger.''
</P>
<P>
   Pressure? Woods embraces it, so it was no surprise to see him
roar going out, making five birdies and turning in 33. Touche, said
Clarke, who also made five birdies, the second of which came at the
par-4 fourth after he stiffed his approach to 5 feet. Incredibly,
it wiped out the only lead Woods would enjoy in the 36-hole match.
The defeat was that convincing.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be honest with you, he flat outplayed me today,'' said
Woods, who matched Clarke nearly shot-for-shot on the back side
(birdies at the par-5 12th, eight pars) to keep the match all
square heading into the afternoon 18. While Woods rushed from the
18th green to a driving range that was quite a distance from the
first tee, Clarke decided otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   ``Put it this way,'' said the 260-pound Clarke, who joked
frequently about his weight, ``I didn't want to walk back down the
hill again and walk back up.'' So he lit up an ever-present cigar,
had lunch, and pondered a six-birdie effort, a round of 67, and a
week that already had gone beyond his expectations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't set any goals at the start of the week,'' said
Clarke, the 19th seed. ``Probably get through two or three rounds
would have been pretty good.''
</P>
<P>
   Pretty good quickly turned to quite remarkable as Clarke
duplicated his morning assault on the outgoing nine. He birdied the
first hole to go 1 up, fell to all square when Woods birdied the
par-5 second, then assumed the lead for good with a conceded birdie
at the fourth after Woods could do no better than bogey. It started
a stretch of four birdies in five holes, which put him 4 up and had
Clarke thinking one thing: ``Birdie four of the next five.''
</P>
<P>
   Not quite, though Clarke, after losing a hole to Woods's birdie
at the par-5 ninth, continued to hit fairways and greens, his
blueprint for success all day.
</P>
<P>
   Even if his place in the fairway was 30 yards behind Woods, as
was the case at the 10th hole.
</P>
<P>
   Clarke, from about 180 yards, played his approach to the center
of the green, safe, but on the lower tier and nothing that would
shake Woods. ``He puts it 40 feet to the right,'' said Woods,
holding a 9-iron from 156 yards and envisioning a shot that would
set up a birdie and cut the deficit to two holes. ``I had the
perfect opening to knock it on the shelf in there.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Woods pushed his approach right, landing it even
farther from the hole than Clarke's. ``Not to be able to shape that
shot in there,'' said Woods, ``that's frustrating. I was just
trying to find my golf swing, to be honest with you.''
</P>
<P>
   The frustration carried over to his putting stroke: a birdie bid
that he rolled 5 feet strong, and a comebacker he missed. Three
putts. Four down. But Clarke refused to breathe easy. ``I was
expecting Tiger to do a couple of special things and have a go at
me,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A Woods birdie at the par-3 11th could have signaled a charge,
but Woods's momentum defused quickly at the par-5 12th, where he
had performed his magic in Saturday's semifinal thrashing of Davis
Love, a 6-iron from 221 yards that bent around a tree and led to
eagle. This time, Woods's pushed approach into the right bunker led
to a rally-killing par.
</P>
<P>
   It was a tough lie, said Woods, who had very little green to
work with and tried to fluff it perfectly. He left it in the sand,
blasted out close, and walked away with matching pars.
</P>
<P>
   At the 13th, Clarke made his 12th birdie of the day, matching
one by Woods, to remain 4 up, and when the next two holes were
halved with pars, the thumping that everyone had expected was
complete.
</P>
<P>
   ``Except,'' said Harmon, ``Clarke did to Tiger what Tiger has
been doing to everyone else.''

was coming back from back problems. Fassero was the Mariners'
Opening Day starter last season, too, after Johnson was traded to
Houston.
</P>
<P>
   So Red Sox general manager Dan Duquette, needing a veteran
starter to replace the surgically impaired Bret Saberhagen, scored
a major coup when he signed the lefthanded Fassero as a free agent
in the offseason, right?
</P>
<P>
   Come October, maybe everyone will be in agreement, especially if
Fassero helps pitch the Sox back into the playoffs for a third
straight season.
</P>
<P>
   But in February, with Fassero graying at 37, coming off the
worst season of his career, and just 16 months removed from elbow
surgery, there are legitimate concerns that he is closer to the
final curtain than another opening.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox clearly are betting otherwise. At the moment,
Fassero ranks as the team's No. 3 starter, behind the brothers
Martinez, and is the only lefthander in a rotation that didn't have
one last season until Kent Mercker was acquired in August.
</P>
<P>
   ``You want to forget, but you can't,'' Fassero said of last
season, when he went 5-14 and had an earned run average of 7.20,
the highest ERA for a pitcher with at least 150 innings in 62
years. ``I'm not going to deny it was a terrible year.
</P>
<P>
   ``A year like that eats away at your confidence. But I have a
mindset where I'm determined to go out and prove that last year was
not really me. It's no way to end a career.''
</P>
<P>
   Fassero is hoping he can jump-start that career again by
reuniting with Joe Kerrigan, pitching M.D., his mentor for five
years in Montreal. Each morning, before the dew has even dried on
the freshly mown grass here, Fassero and Kerrigan have trudged to a
practice mound for a daily session of shadow pitching, in which
Fassero simulates his delivery without throwing a ball.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mechanics were horrible last season,'' Fassero said. ``Joe
knew me for five years, which helps a lot. He looked at film of me
in Montreal and told me, `I know what you're doing wrong, I know
what we can do to correct you.' ''
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, Fassero won 13 games for the Mariners, the fourth
straight season in which he had won 13 or more games, and he also
threw 224 2/3 innings, the seventh-highest total in the league. But
his elbow had begun to bother him as early as March that year, and
in October, Fassero had surgery to remove bone chips and shave bone
spurs.
</P>
<P>
   He admits his fouled-up mechanics the following season may have
been due to the surgery.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a good possibility I could have subconsciously been doing
things to protect my elbow,'' he said. ``Your mind and body want to
compensate for an injury.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it was a situation I just couldn't get out of.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners, already reeling from the absence of Johnson, were
in full retreat when they finally sent Fassero to the bullpen in
mid-June. The Texas Rangers, looking for a lefthanded starter for
the stretch run, picked up Fassero in a late-August waiver deal and
he won all three of his starts, but they wound up putting him in
the bullpen, too, and made no effort to re-sign him.
</P>
<P>
   Duquette, after flirting with the idea of signing lefthanded
Angels ace Chuck Finley before the asking price soared, signed
Fassero three days before Christmas. Sunday morning, Fassero faced
live hitters for the first time this spring, and he appeared
self-conscious as he attempted to implement the corrections
Kerrigan had suggested.
</P>
<P>
   ``My back leg has been collapsing, which makes my front shoulder
go up too high,'' said Fassero, who last season did not have his
usual command of his off-speed pitches, most notably his forkball.
``We're working on keeping my shoulder level. It feels pretty
comfortable, the way it needs to feel.''
</P>
<P>
   Jason Varitek was a young catcher in the Seattle system when
Fassero was at the top of his game. He recalls catching him only
once or twice, but he watched him plenty and, of course, has faced
him as an opposition batter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Fassero can still be a dominating lefthanded
pitcher,'' Varitek said. ``His problems last year were just
mechanical. I think he's going to be a guy we're going to be able
to rely on. Joe (Kerrigan) will get him back to where he's pitching
naturally. I'm very confident that this is a guy who just had one
off year, really.''

   &UR; c. 2000, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
LOS ANGELES _ The good news is that Rudy Tomjanovich has a new
four-year contract to get him through days like this.
</P>
<P>
   The bad news: That extended time will feel like 28 in dog years
if the Rockets continue to feed him such a steady diet of
Alpo-inspired efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Woof! Woof!
</P>
<P>
   The young nucleus of which the organization is so proud might as
well have been a litter of puppies chasing their tails for the
production they had Sunday against the Lakers.
</P>
<P>
   They rolled over. They played dead.
</P>
<P>
   They needed a flea dip.
</P>
<P>
   It is not losing 101-85 to one of the hottest teams in
basketball that is cause for concern, but more the way they did it.
Or rather, didn't.
</P>
<P>
   From the opening tap, Kobe Bryant, Shaquille O'Neal and the
Lakers appeared bigger, stronger and quicker, while the Rockets
looked uncoordinated, out of control, even disinterested.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was like they were playing a different game than us,''
Tomjanovich said. ``This is the kind of thing I expected earlier in
the year. It's not pretty, not fun to sit there and watch.''
</P>
<P>
   And despite some of the highlight-film images we have been
presented by rookie sensation Steve Francis and a few memorable
wins along the way _ i.e., over the Lakers on Jan. 30 _ what is
important to keep in mind is that the Rockets are a lot farther
away from returning to the level of playoff contenders than Houston
wants to let itself think.
</P>
<P>
   For those with a lack of patience or a low pain threshold, the
next couple of years might be a good time to find a hobby or start
watching PBS until Rudy T can slowly, steadily get this thing up on
two strong legs again. At this point, the Rockets can barely crawl.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had already beaten the Lakers twice this season and should
have beaten them a third time,'' Francis said. ``I think we were
all excited about coming out here on national TV and doing it to
them again. I guess we got a whole lot carried away.''
</P>
<P>
   We guess.
</P>
<P>
   When the Rockets last met and beat the Lakers, it was Super Bowl
Sunday, so long ago it was still football season. Now, as February
gives way to March, it is indisputably basketball season, and these
are clearly two teams headed in entirely different directions.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers, after suffering through their own period of malaise,
are back rolling again, playing cohesively on offense and
aggressively on defense.
</P>
<P>
   The Rockets, after a brief fling with a six-game winning streak
in early January that gave them an inflated sense of themselves,
are now playing like a team without a sense of purpose or pride.
</P>
<P>
   What is alarming is that in their last seven games, the Rockets
have been blown out four times. Not just beaten, but thoroughly
whipped, beaten and destroyed. Too many times they have looked like
a team that is not ready to compete.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's my fault,'' said Francis, who is never shy to take the
burden. ``Rookie or not, it's my job to get us into the game and
playing with a rhythm. Today it was like I was out there with my
own drum.''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, he struggled again on offense, finishing with just six
points on 2-for-11 shooting and seven turnovers.
</P>
<P>
   But it was more than Francis. It was all of them, shooting just
36 percent, getting hammered on the boards, falling behind 30-13
after the first quarter and 48-29 by halftime.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, there are physical problems to consider. Shaq and Kobe are
a bundle to handle, and the Rockets are playing without the injured
Kelvin Cato, and Hakeem Olajuwon had to leave after just 13 minutes
because of unexplained fatigue.
</P>
<P>
   But this has happened of late in Atlanta, in San Antonio, at
home against Denver. A lack of commitment, of effort.
</P>
<P>
   Before anybody starts planning parade routes for the next
championship, it would be wise to wait for the heart of this young
team to prove itself over the long haul rather than one hot week or
two.
</P>
<P>
   What we know about Cuttino Mobley is he'll create one-on-one
opportunities for himself to score. We know Kenny Thomas has a
spark. We know Francis is spectacular but can be spectacularly bad.
We know Bryce Drew is, well, still here.
</P>
<P>
   What we don't know is how they'll grow or if they'll grow
together.
</P>
<P>
   ``The difference in a good team is that it won't always bring
its A-level game,'' said Matt Bullard. ``That's not possible. But
it always will bring the same kind of effort. It's getting your
mind ready. We're not there yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, the good news is that we've got the Clippers next.''
</P>
<P>
   The bad news is that the Clippers are saying the same thing
about the young pups of the Rockets, who are still far more bark
than bite.

U.S. FOREIGN POLICY, THE DEMOCRATIC WAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By NORMAN LEVINE  
 c.2000 Special for The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; (LAST IN A SERIES OF THREE ARTICLES. ALSO MOVING IN THE ``K''
CATEGORY  &UR; - RESENDING INHERITING-1, INHERITING-2 AND INHERITING-3
FOR THOSE WHO MAY HAVE MISSED THIS SPECIAL PACKAGE. The author
 &UR; examines the Democratic ``Liberal Moralist'' and ``Liberal
Realist''
 &UR; positions in the debate over the direction of American foreign
policy.)
</P>
<P>
   The American people are undergoing an out-of-body experience:
History is repeating itself, and they have been transferred back to
1920 and the battle waged by Woodrow Wilson and Henry Cabot Lodge
over America's entry into the League of Nations.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson wanted both to make the world ``safe for democracy'' and
for the United States to obey the covenant of the League of
Nations, irrespective of national self-interest. His opponent was
Lodge, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, and
although Lodge favored America's entry into the League, he wished
to modify certain articles as a means of preserving U.S. national
self-interest.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson refused to make any concessions and, in 1920, the League
went down to defeat. The conservatives of 2000 are the spiritual
descendants of Lodge, while present-day liberals inherit the legacy
of Wilson.
</P>
<P>
   As a liberal moralist, Clintonian foreign policy is an amalgam
of Wilson, Jimmy Carter's ``universal human rights'' and reaction
against the Vietnam War with its rejection of unilateral action by
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   After initial hesitation in 1993, Clintonian diplomacy shattered
the boundaries of the containment of Communism theory articulated
by George F. Kennan, a foreign-policy expert and diplomat, at the
beginning of the Cold War. Essentially a strategy to halt further
imperialism of the Stalinist empire, containment theory limited the
extension of American power to the Elbe, which, from 1947 to 1990,
was the eastern border of Germany. &QL; 
NATO EXPANSION &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Clintonian foreign policy committed itself to the enlargement of
the horizon of democracy, and Clinton pursued this goal on two
fronts: expansion of NATO in Europe and support of Boris Yeltsin in
Russia. When Clinton embarked on the jihad of making the world safe
for democracy, he not only embraced this aspect of Wilsonism but
capitulated to the arguments of Anthony Lake, his first national
security adviser.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton Doctrine brought Poland, the Czech Republic and
Hungary into NATO. By including these three countries under the
NATO umbrella, the United States committed itself to the defense of
countries it never previously considered within its own sphere of
national self-interest. This enormous broadening of American
guarantees was justified under the principle of missionary
democracy.
</P>
<P>
   In expanding NATO, Clinton broke American implied agreements
with Mikhail Gorbachev. ``A World Transformed,'' written by George
Bush, who was president at the time of the disintegration of the
Soviet Empire in Eastern Europe, and Brent Scowcroft, Bush's
national security adviser, is unequivocal on this point: At no time
did Bush, Scowcroft, or Secretary of State James Baker indicate to
Gorbachev that NATO would be extended eastward to Poland, the Czech
Republic and Hungary after the Soviets voluntarily renounced their
title to these tracts of land.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. policy toward Yeltsin was another case of missionary
democracy. The Clinton administration adamantly supported Yeltsin
on the grounds that he was leading the democratic capitalist
transformation of Russia.
</P>
<P>
   However, Yeltsin's resignation from office and the crowning of
Vladimir Putin as his successor is a serious setback for the
Clinton doctrine. Putin's recent alliance with the Communists
belies the assertion that democracy is functioning in Russia.
</P>
<P>
   According to Lee Hamilton, Democratic loyalist, respected former
chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, and current
director of the Woodrow Wilson Foundation, Putin's recent coalition
with the Communists ``amounts to a defeat for Clinton, for it
strengthens the power of the Communists in the Duma.'' &QL; 
PUSHING MULTILATERALISM &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Another Wilson ideal that the Clinton doctrine continues is that
American diplomacy should unfold within multilateral institutions.
Liberal moralists are suspicious of unilateral actions because they
fear it will give rise to worldwide anti-Americanism.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of the fact that recent ventures in which America
acted under the aegis of the United Nations _ such as in Somalia,
Bosnia-Herzegovina and Kosovo _ all appear to be failures, the
White House still upholds the usefulness of multilateralism. The
Oval Office fears the bully backlash _ that other nations will
express their resentment against the paramountcy of the United
States by opposing American policies.
</P>
<P>
   Another principle of liberal moralism to which the Clinton
doctrine abides is free trade.
</P>
<P>
   Liberal moralism wishes to turn the movement toward economic
globalization to an advantage for the United States, and so Clinton
has devoted much effort to the reduction of tariffs.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton wishes to use trade as a form of social engineering,
because he hopes that free trade will encourage the growth of a
capitalist entrepreneurial class in countries making the transition
out of communism, like China. Borrowing a phrase from his former
economic adviser, Andrea Tyson, Clinton thinks in terms of
``strategic trade,'' or trade with a deeper purpose than just
making a profit.
</P>
<P>
   In its approach to China, the Clinton doctrine combines the
strategic trade and the ``strategic partner'' approaches.
</P>
<P>
   The theory of the strategic partner is to detach China from any
``anti-hegemonist'' bloc alliance. Primarily, this means preventing
the re-creation of the Cold War Sino-Soviet coalition. &QL; 
OVAL OFFICE'S PLAN &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The hook of strategic trade is associated with the universal
human-rights theory of Carter. By its use of strategic trade, the
Oval Office hopes to ensnare President Jiang Zemin into granting
more ``human rights'' to Chinese citizens. The ultimate aim of
trans-Pacific social engineering is to both speed the development
of a commercial middle class in China and to provide these
entrepreneurs with the protective shield of civil liberties.
</P>
<P>
   Conservatives of all camps attack the Clinton doctrine on China
as a contradiction between rewards and punishments.
</P>
<P>
   Reflecting upon the differences that separate Republicans and
Democrats, Democratic loyalist Hamilton told ``The Arizona
Republic,'' ``Republicans are very skeptical of international
organizations, such as the U.N., the World Trade Organization and
the like. Democrats generally support these multilateral
institutions.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a monopolar world in the social and economic
sense. Even though the U.S. is the only superpower in the military
or `hard' sense, it cannot dictate to all nations of the globe in
matters of gender, children, values or culture. In terms of `soft'
power _ education, information and trade, this is a multipolar
world and the U.S. must learn to act in conjunction with
international organizations.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is important to recognize that the most important lever of
diplomatic power has changed from `hard' to `soft' power. To me,
trade is the crucial issue.'' &QL; 
PARTY SPLIT ON POLICIES &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``The Republicans tend to stress military power,'' Hamilton
added. ``I am an unrepentant free-trader because I believe that
unrestricted trade, from which all sides benefit, is the best way
to export the democratic order.''
</P>
<P>
   But policies are divisive ones within the Democratic Party. To
hold the presidency again in November, Democrats desperately need
the support of American labor, and the AFL-CIO has already endorsed
Vice President Al Gore. Nevertheless, a divorce has taken place
between the corporatist and labor wings of the Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   The corporatists favor strategic trade and China's entry into
the World Trade Organization, because they will be the ``winners''
from the globalization of trade, while Big Labor is opposed to
these policies, because they will be the ``losers'' when domestic
wages are repressed. The Seattle meeting of the World Trade
Organization ended in chaos when Big Labor and environmentalists
led street demonstrations demanding environmental protections, an
end to child labor in China and other Asian countries and
improvement of working conditions before any further reduction of
tariffs.
</P>
<P>
   The issues of China and world trade will be hotly debated along
partisan lines when Congress is called on to approve China's entry
into the World Trade Organization in the fall, and they will play a
major role in the November elections.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has already become a victim of the Democratic dependency on
Big Labor. Gore suffers from a split personality: one face as vice
president and the other as party candidate. As vice president, he
speaks in favor of the Clinton doctrine, but as candidate he must
massage the labor unions.
</P>
<P>
   This past week, Gore's divided personality made the front pages
when the AFL-CIO criticized him for placing the reduction of
tariffs before the increase of wages, the growth of labor unions
and the end of sweat shops in Third World countries.
</P>
<P>
   In spite of Gore's problems with the labor unions, he is also a
Liberal Moralist. In the war of words currently waged in opinion
journals, Stephen M. Walt, a professor of international relations
at Harvard University, has acted as the vice president's script
writer. In an article in the March/April issue of ``Foreign
Affairs,'' Walt has written a Democratic response to the Republican
broadsides that were published by ``Foreign Affairs'' in the
previous issue. The vice president's proxy only proved that on
foreign affairs, Gore is a clone of Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Bradley is also a Liberal Moralist and although there are
no significant differences between Gore and Clinton, there are
important divisions between Gore-Clinton and Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   Gore-Clinton favor an increase in the defense budget, but
Bradley advocates a cut in appropriations for the Defense
Department. Bradley would use the money saved from the military
spending for his domestic agenda such as his health and
anti-poverty programs. Bradley is also far more attuned to the
growing gulf between the cyberspace Atlantic world and the
spinning-wheel Third World.  &QL; 
`BULLY BACKLASH' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Liberal realists, particularly professor Michael Mandelbaum of
the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies, agrees
with Clinton-Gore that it is vital to work within multinational
organizations, but he dissents from the Clinton doctrine on the
issue that America should become a global proselytizer for
democracy.
</P>
<P>
   Mandelbaum led the charge against the expansion of NATO because
he feared the ``bully backlash.'' Mandelbaum's essay, ``Foreign
Policy as Social Work,'' appeared in the January/February 1996
issue of ``Foreign Affairs.'' In the essay, he criticized Clinton
for seeking to turn the United States into the messiah of
constitutional government.
</P>
<P>
   Mandelbaum wrote of Clinton and Lake, his first national
security adviser: ``They tried and failed to turn American foreign
policy into a branch of social work.''
</P>
<P>
   Clintonian foreign policy, Mandelbaum and the entire liberal
realist camp argues, has overextended and overtaxed U.S. resources
around the world. The liberal realists oppose intervention in the
internal affairs of other sovereign states, and they reject the
notion that America can play the world's shrink, using the methods
of a social worker to aid the dysfunctional.
</P>
<P>
   No Republican or Democratic candidate in the current campaign
embraces isolationist or protectionist positions. As the new
century dawns, the United States is experiencing instant historical
replay. The First World War is over, the Treaty of Versailles is
written, and America in 2000 must decide whether it will sign the
League of Nations in 1920.
</P>
<P>
   All those who favor close collaboration with international
organizations, forgoing all instances of unilateral intervention,
will vote for Woodrow Wilson. All those who favor the retention of
full American self-interest, the need for unilateral intervention
to further national security, will vote for Lodge. But whatever
your vote, you must face the consequences: If Americans can put
aside their obsession with the marrying-a- multimillionaire
melodrama, they will bear in mind that history is a life-and-death
sentence, that it repeats itself, and the Second World War followed
the First.  &QL;

state, which will account for only 2.2 percent of delegates at the

HARPER SIGN OF RED SOX' REDEMPTION 
</HEADLINE>
 COLUMN-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAN SHAUGHNESSY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT MYERS, Fla. _ Tommy Harper is back with the Red Sox, and
his presence in a Boston uniform says a lot about how far the ball
club has come in the area of race relations.
</P>
<P>
   Sixteen years ago, Harper was Rosa Parks in Fenway's first base
coach's box. He was a black man brave enough to answer questions
truthfully about club policies that condoned racism at the club's
spring site in Winter Haven. The words cost him his job, which led
to a discrimination suit against the ball club. In 1986, when the
Red Sox played in the World Series, Harper was hanging out at an
auto body shop near Fenway Park. His suit eventually settled, he
spent two years out of baseball, then joined the Montreal
organization, where he worked until now.
</P>
<P>
   A lot has changed since Harper left. The Red Sox organization in
the early '80s was polluted by employees and attitudes held over
from the 1940s and '50s. An institutional racism colored hiring and
scouting, making Boston a tough place to work if you didn't look
like Dave Stapleton or Glenn Hoffman.
</P>
<P>
   No more. The 2000 Red Sox clubhouse _ long a sanctuary for
average white guys _ is a study in racial and cultural diversity.
It's where Jin Ho Cho, Israel Alcantara, Rheal Cormier, and Pedro
Martinez dress alongside Michael Coleman, Tomokazu Ohka, and Derek
Lowe. The Sox don't have a single player named Whitey. They've
beefed up international scouting, set up a baseball academy in the
Dominican Republic, and reached out to Boston's inner-city
community with both arms. They've washed their hands of old sins,
and the hiring of Harper is both practical and symbolic.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is like night and day,'' said the 59-year-old first base
coach. ``This is a different atmosphere altogether. It's
refreshing. It's not the same as it was. It's a lot better, and the
Red Sox as an organization have done it quietly. They don't go
around beating their chest and saying, `Look what we've done.'
They've just done it. Let people write or let people see what they
see. You don't have to say, `We have X amount of minorities.' We're
just an organization . . . taking people who can do the job. I
don't feel like there's a number, or that I'm a number.''
</P>
<P>
   He wears No. 35 and will work in the box vacated when Dave Jauss
took a position as minor league field coordinator. Harper still
holds the Sox record for steals (54) in a season, and he helped
Carlton Fisk steal 11 bases when he worked as a first base coach
for Don Zimmer and Ralph Houk. The Expos led the majors in steals
three times under Harper's tutelage.
</P>
<P>
   He's not sure how much the Sox will run this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I need to know more about how Jimy (Williams) runs his
games,'' said Harper. ``Now all I can do is focus on the players
who have speed and work on fundamentals. The theory part as to when
to run always comes with the manager. I have to find out what Jimy
likes to do and when he likes to run and doesn't like to run. That
will come later. Now all I do is work with the runners and get
their techniques down.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do believe that the better the hitters are on your team, the
less you have to take a risk on the bases. But there are times when
base stealers feel it's not much of a risk. There are times when
the runners have to help the hitters.''
</P>
<P>
   Harper, who lives year-round in Sharon, played for the Sox for
three seasons and worked in the organization for six more years
before he was banished by his own words.
</P>
<P>
   For those who don't remember, this is why he left:
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox trained in Winter Haven for a quarter-century, and
before Harper spoke, the club allowed representatives of the local,
whites-only Elks Club to leave courtesy passes on the chairs of the
white players and coaches. As far as anyone knows, nobody ever used
the passes, but the Globe's Michael Madden discovered the practice
and asked Harper about it. Harper validated the story, and the
fallout was fierce and predictable.
</P>
<P>
   ``I regret that the story even had to come out,'' said Harper.
``I wish that it could have been taken care of internally, which I
tried to do. I went to the organization a year before Mike Madden
asked me the question. I had said that this thing could become an
embarrassment to the ball club at some point. It was agreed that
that was a fact, but a year later the same things occurred. I
thought they were going to take care of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was well known by a lot of people, but it just wasn't out
there. I didn't go to the writer, the writer came to me. Had I said
anything different, people would have known it was a lie because
people all knew. It was difficult at times. My main concern was
that I liked baseball and wanted to be a part of baseball. At the
time I didn't have a job, and it was very tough.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's still a little sticky for me. I never discussed it with
anybody because I wasn't angry. I never was. It was something that
happened, and I wish it didn't have to happen that way and
everything could have been taken care of and I never would have had
to leave in the first place. It was just an unfortunate thing. It
got the Red Sox a whole bunch of bad publicity and national
exposure for the wrong reasons, and people were angry with me
within the organization. The toughest thing for me was that people
that I thought were my friends were angry because I answered a
question. But that's the way I felt. I felt it was wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   It was wrong and it was corrected. And the Red Sox seem to have
learned from past sins. All these years later, Harper is back on
the Boston baseline, where he belongs.

CELTICS FOCUS ON RODMAN, NOT HIS ANTICS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL VEGA  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WALTHAM, Mass. _ You have to go back to the 1980s, when Detroit
was Rock City and the world champion Pistons were the NBA's Bad
Boys, to recall the Dennis Rodman of yore, the one Tony Battie
fondly remembered Sunday as being ``a levelheaded guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Yup, you read that right.
</P>
<P>
   Dennis Rodman . . . levelheaded guy.
</P>
<P>
   Of all the villainous acts Rodman has perpetrated in his NBA
career _ don't even get Karl Malone started _ being ``levelheaded''
is one thing he's never been accused of before. NBA scofflaw? Yes.
But levelheaded? NBA commissioner David Stern would probably
convulse in laughter to hear that one.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got a lot of things in common with him kind of right now,
because we both went to the same high school (South Oak Cliff) and
we both grew up in Dallas,'' Battie said after practice Sunday in
preparation for Monday's 7 p.m. visit from Rodman and the Mavericks
at the FleetCenter. ``We're not looking to turn it into a circus
event or anything like that. We just want to go out and help the
Celtics win.''
</P>
<P>
   But Battie knows their Texas ties are where all similarities
end.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dennis is one of the best _ if not the best _ rebounders in
the game,'' Battie said. ``So we have to take this game serious.''
</P>
<P>
   Back in the day when he was considered a bit actor in Detroit's
championship cast of Isiah Thomas, Bill Laimbeer, John Salley, Joe
Dumars, and Vinny (The Microwave) Johnson, Rodman was just your
average, run-of-the-mill rebounding fool.
</P>
<P>
   Now that he has embraced a bohemian lifestyle, discovered
sparkle lip gloss, wed and then divorced Carmen Electra after an
all-nighter in Las Vegas, done time recently in a Miami jail with
said ball-and-chain (oops, that's Mrs. ex-ball-and-chain),
co-starred with Jean-Claude Van Damme in an entirely forgettable
action flick, and written in his outrageous tome about his desire
to play his last NBA game in the nude, he is fancied a fool who can
really rebound.
</P>
<P>
   A recalcitrant rebounder.
</P>
<P>
   But, as Malone will tell you, Rodman has a tendency to cause a
stir on the court. What exactly does he do to cause such a
distraction?
</P>
<P>
   ``He outhustles you. He taunts you. He gets away with a lot of
stuff,'' said Danny Fortson. ``But he's won seven NBA rebounding
championships and a couple of world championships, so I guess he's
able to do stuff like that. That's what frustrates a lot of young
players who go up against him, because he gets away with a lot, but
you just have to keep your cool and keep going hard.''
</P>
<P>
   In the six games he's played since signing with the Mavericks
Feb. 3, Rodman has been hit with five technicals, ejected from two
games, fined $10,000 and suspended for one game, and slapped with
another $3,500 fine for failing to leave the court in a timely
manner following an ejection.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shoot, they should have suspended me,'' Rodman told the Dallas
Morning News after Saturday night's 98-96 victory over the visiting
Denver Nuggets, a game in which Rodman picked up yet another
technical for arguing about a foul. ``I'm surprised they didn't,
because it seems like they're trying to prove some kind of point.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether or not Rodman proves to be a distraction on the court is
not Rick Pitino's concern. ``The only thing I'm concerned about is
rebounding,'' said the Celtics coach. ``The other stuff I'm not
concerned about, because he's a ferocious rebounder. They won seven
out of eight prior to Rodman's arrival, so they have excellent
talent. But Rodman just gives them one of the premier rebounders
and defenders in the game. Each game that goes by, he just gets
himself into better and better shape.''
</P>
<P>
   Through six games, Rodman is averaging 14.8 rebounds, having
collected 89 total (including 65 on the defensive boards). His
offense (2.7 ppg), meanwhile, has left much to be desired. ``Ahh,
that's because he's got no offense,'' Fortson added with a laugh.
``Simple as that.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Pitino, ``We've got to rebound with two people, because one
is not enough against Rodman. What happens a lot is that you feel
he's not an offensive factor on the perimeter, so you go to help
out, and he pushes you from the baseline and grabs the offensive
rebound.''
</P>
<P>
   With scorers such as Michael Finley (22.3 ppg), Cedric Ceballos
(18.5), and Dirk Nowitzki (17.3), who needs offense from Rodman?
</P>
<P>
   ``When you've got confidence in scorers like that and then
you've got some security down there with a guy who's going to bust
his butt to get the rebound,'' Battie said, ``it takes a little bit
more pressure off those guys shooting it, knowing that Dennis is
going to grab the board and get it back to them.''
</P>
<P>
   By any means necessary.

   BOSTON _ The struggle continues, and so does the search. With
the NHL trade deadline only two weeks away, the Bruins need more
than John Grahame, a rabbit's foot, and a box of Lucky Charms if
they're going to keep alive their faint dream of playing beyond
April 9.
</P>
<P>
   They need bodies, specifically a capable scorer or two and a
presence back on the blue line. The two players they picked up
along the way _ winger Joe Murphy and defenseman Marty McSorley _
both are now, shall we say, otherwise engaged.
</P>
<P>
   Murphy was a hothead who got himself fired. McSorley went
swinging for the fence and got himself knocked right out of the
ballpark.
</P>
<P>
   For a roster already depleted by injuries and the ever-present
budget concerns, the Murphy-McSorley losses were two more crushing
blows. They also should have been a call to action for the front
office.
</P>
<P>
   Assistant general manager Mike O'Connell, who was with the club
over the weekend for the win in Washington (3-0) and the tie in
Pittsburgh (2-2), said trade talks have been ongoing but, to date,
unpromising. ``Yeah, we've been making calls, and other clubs have
been calling us,'' said O'Connell. ``We'll keep looking, but right
now, there's no one being offered who interests us.''
</P>
<P>
   In short, don't count on the cast of characters changing much,
even with lingering injuries to Byron Dafoe (knee), Anson Carter
(shoulder), and Rob DiMaio (torn hand ligament), and the loss of
No. 1 pivot Jason Allison (wrist surgeries) for the duration.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the club's most tradeable commodity, Sergei Samsonov
struck for goals in Washington and Pittsburgh, only the second time
he has scored in back-to-back games all season. If the little left
winger could start mirroring the promise he showed in his freshman
and sophomore seasons, that would be a major boost to what has been
a moribund offense.
</P>
<P>
   The pursuit of badly needed personnel aside, a couple of very
encouraging signs emerged last week. To wit:
</P>
<P>
   --The Bruins finally began to skate. Head coach Pat Burns
finally implemented a more aggressive forechecking scheme 3-4 weeks
ago that has brought a number of positive results. Not only is the
opposition held at bay a little more, relieving pressure on the
defense, but it also has the entire five-man unit more routinely
skating forward rather than standing still in the neutral zone or
lost in retreat. For one period in Edmonton, and for all three
periods in Washington, it looked like a club with a replaced clutch
and a new transmission. Given the Bruins' talent level, no one can
expect an Indy race here, but at least they appear to have stopped
playing Demolition Derby.
</P>
<P>
   --The play of Grahame in net brought an obvious and badly needed
spark. In fact, the boost he provided was as obvious as the club's
improved skating. The Bruins broke to the lead in Washington and
Pittsburgh. Grahame, hot here before being demoted after Dafoe
ended his monthlong holdout, did not allow one bad goal in two
nights and both times was awarded the No. 1 star. Count on Burns
rolling him out again Tuesday night when the Senators come to town.
If he stays sharp, he'll remain the No. 1 goalie for the full final
quarter of the regular season. Simply put, Grahame is the single
best thing the club has going for it right now.
</P>
<P>
   The microcosm of the Washington-Pittsburgh swing provides some
important math. The Bruins collected three of four points, .750
efficiency, in the two stops. Keep that number in mind. With 20
games to go, and considerable ground to make up in hopes of landing
the No. 8 playoff berth, the Bruins essentially have to hit three
for four the rest of the way. Based on how they've played for the
majority of the season, that doesn't seem realistic, but a hot
goalie and a slightly uptempo skating game make it far more a
possibility than it was a week ago.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps, though atypical of a classic turning point, last Monday
night, when McSorley bashed Vancouver's Donald Brashear, will be
remembered as the time the season bottomed out. When everyone
around the club was wondering if things could get worse, suddenly
things got better. At least for two games. The skating fell off
some Saturday night, but that could be expected after the effort in
Washington and the fact that it was the fifth game of a five-game
sojourn.
</P>
<P>
   At Washington, Paul Holmgren and ex-goalie Ron Hextall,
respectively assistant general manager and scout for the Flyers,
were seen in the press box. Rumors have circulated for two seasons
that Philly will make a deal for a No. 1 goalie. Perhaps Holmgren
and Hextall were there in hopes of rating Dafoe, who was back in
Boston having his knee examined.
</P>
<P>
   If the Bruins are convinced that Grahame is their guy in net for
the rest of the season, and if they are equally convinced he is
their guy for the future, then that could convince them the time
could be right to deal Dafoe. In return, they would have to ask for
a legitimate goal-scoring winger. A goal-scoring center would be
fine, too, especially now, but that role should be filled
adequately by Allison and Joe Thornton for many years. The two top
names to fit the description in Philly are, of course, Mark Recchi
and John LeClair, neither of whom would be available. After them,
it's a considerable drop to Daymond Langkow, who in the '95 draft
was the No. 5 pick overall by Tampa Bay.
</P>
<P>
   All of that, of course, is purely speculation. Chances are, the
Bruins won't do a thing to change personnel between now and March
14. The past two years, they've let the trade deadline come and go
like any other, which, come to think of it, might be why they woke
up Sunday in 12th place in the Eastern Conference, looking at the
prospect of not reaching the playoffs for the second time in four
seasons.

DE LA HOYA VOWS TO SHOW JUDGES 
</HEADLINE>
 LA HOYA-COLEY-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON BORGES  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Kevin Kelley was watching at ringside. The former
featherweight champion knew exactly what Oscar De La Hoya was doing
Saturday night as he steadfastly pursued Derrell Coley until he had
knocked him to his knee for a 10-count at the end of the seventh
round at Madison Square Garden.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was sending a message to (Felix) Trinidad and (Shane)
Mosley and the rest of the guys who want to fight him,'' Kelley
said. ``He's coming to hurt people now.''
</P>
<P>
   De La Hoya had promised such a thing in the weeks following his
controversial loss to Trinidad last September, a fight in which he
blew a comfortable lead by running for the last three rounds
instead of fighting, thereby losing a split decision and the right
to complain about it.
</P>
<P>
   Now De La Hoya is on the verge of either a rematch with Trinidad
June 10 at Caesars Palace in Las Vegas or a fight against Mosley,
the undefeated former lightweight champion now campaigning as a
welterweight, June 17 at the Staples Center in Los Angeles. Either
way, De La Hoya promised Saturday he will use the same stalking
style he employed against Coley, whose steps he dogged from the
opening bell to the final crushing shot to the liver that destroyed
his opponent's will.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fighter you saw is the fighter I am,'' De La Hoya said.
``I'm not going to box anybody (anymore). No more Mr. Nice Guy. Let
them adjust to my style instead of me adjusting to theirs. Whoever
it is, I'll be ready. I'll be strong. My goal for 2000 is four
fights, four knockouts.''
</P>
<P>
   Stopping Coley is one thing, however. Stopping the quick-moving
Mosley or the power-punching Trinidad will be quite another.
</P>
<P>
   As De La Hoya made these boasts from a makeshift dais in the
Garden rotunda, Mosley stood in the back watching, wearing an
impeccable suit and a wide smile. He had come to see the ``new''
Oscar De La Hoya unveiled, the one who promised mayhem.
</P>
<P>
   What he saw, though, was not what De La Hoya promised. At least
not to Mosley's trained eyes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought Coley didn't come to fight,'' Mosley said. ``He was
in to survive. I think I can trade with anybody. I want the fight
because it's a good fight for the fans all over the world and an
opportunity for me to make my reputation.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I'm not sure it can be made now. It will depend on what
happens with Trinidad and David Reid.''
</P>
<P>
   Those two fight next weekend, and if Trinidad wins the 154-pound
title, he is likely to relinquish the welterweight belts he now
holds, one of which will be assumed by De La Hoya. Then they'll
have to agree on a catch weight between 147 and 154 pounds, and the
rematch will be on. But following his victory Saturday night, De La
Hoya said he did not want to go up more than 2 pounds to meet
Trinidad.
</P>
<P>
   Frankly, everything is all but set, but some things could change
if Trinidad loses. Then it would be on to Mosley.
</P>
<P>
   ``I boxed (Trinadad) for 12 rounds,'' De La Hoya said.
``Obviously that didn't work. Thank you, Trinidad. That loss will
bring out the best in me. That loss is the best thing that ever
happened to me. It was unfair, but it got me back to being who I
am.''
</P>
<P>
   De La Hoya believes he is a stone killer again, as he was at
130-140 pounds. He believes he can fight with cold eyes at 147 and
win, and that is how he says he will fight Trinidad or Mosley.
</P>
<P>
   But you will not see Oscar De La Hoya challenging bigger men any
time soon. Not a 154-pound Trinidad, not Reid, and not IBF champion
Fernando Vargas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look, 147 pounds is my weight,'' De La Hoya said. ``I've moved
up four weight classes already. I'm not going to go up more just
because I have to fight a guy. This is my weight, and I'll stay
here for 1 1/2 to 2 years. Then I can move up to junior
middleweight.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the meantime, I'm staying at 147.''
</P>
<P>
   Staying a welterweight stalker looking for one thing: three more
guys to knock out this year.

 BOXOFF-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

<P>
   MASHANTUCKET, Conn. _ The US Olympic boxing team at Sydney could
be the nation's best ever. Even better than the 1976 team, which
produced five gold medalists and future professional champions.
</P>
<P>
   ``More than six of these guys could be world champions, from 106
(pounds) up,'' coach Tom Mustin said after the Olympic box-off
trials ended Saturday. ``Nobody sticks out like a Ray Leonard. It's
more a blue-collar team of hard workers. They will sneak up and
win, like they did at the World Championships.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not making any predictions on how many medals they will
win. But last year was the first time we ever won four at the World
Championships, and some of the guys I predicted would win there
didn't. It was the guys who worked the hardest who won.''
</P>
<P>
   The 1976 US fighters, who included Howard Davis, Leon and
Michael Spinks, Leonard, and Leo Randolph, combined the traits of
amateur eclecticism and professional brutality, bringing a high
national profile to Olympic boxing.
</P>
<P>
   Cincinnati lightweight Ricardo Williams's style recalls that of
the '76 group. But Mustin warns success depends on the basics.
</P>
<P>
   ``Williams is the most talented guy we have,'' Mustin said.
``But unless he does the work he needs to do, some strong guy will
knock him off, like in the World Championships. A lot of times it's
not the best boxer, but the guy who is the strongest, who has the
most stamina.''
</P>
<P>
   The next step is the Americas qualifying round, scheduled for
March 27-April 1 in Tampa.
</P>
<P>
   The US team received a seal of approval from 1996 Olympic coach
Al Mitchell, who works at the US Olympic Education Center in
Marquette, Mich.
</P>
<P>
   ``They will be a good team because they are good kids and they
have good training, good coaching,'' Mitchell said. ``They are more
blessed than in '96, not with skills, but because everyone has gone
pro. In '92, it was only the Russians who had come out, but now you
have Russians, Germans, Hungarians, Poles in the pros. The only
team that doesn't have to start new is the Cubans.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only thing I worry about is the back-to-back fights. They
have to qualify, then qualify again. They are going to have to
watch that they don't overwork them, give them rest.''
</P>
<P>
   The US team won eight medals, including one gold, at the Atlanta
'96 Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before the World Championships, I predicted four gold medals
in the Olympics,'' said Gary Toney, president of USA Boxing. ``When
people look back, I believe this team will be compared to the 1976
team. I don't think that puts any pressure on them at all. They
will definitely match the eight medals and win more than one gold.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the 1997 World Championships, we only won one bout. In
1999, we won four golds and the team title. We went from the bottom
to the top. Our philosophy has changed. We are competing in more
international tournaments, and our coaches are gaining experience
and seeing different styles. It has paid off.''
</P>
<P>
   US training methods have become more sophisticated,
acknowledging the influence of computer-based scoring methods.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tell the fighters we are not trying to change their style,
but enhance their style,'' Mustin said. ``They are fighting against
the computer, and there are some things they need to do to compete
in the international arena.
</P>
<P>
   ``They need to step and run more. They need to make sure the
judges see that their punches are connecting, so that means less
flash. Before, we weren't studying how to score against the
computer. Other countries did. We didn't.''
</P>
<P>
   The most controversial elements of the trials surround the
granting of an Australian visa to heavyweight Michael Bennett, a
convicted felon, and a charge of racism by coach Ted Palac, whose
son, Arthur, was defeated, 10-9, by Jeff Lacy at 165 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   Bennett, 28, served seven years in prison for armed robbery.
Australia does not grant visas to felons, except in special cases.
USA Boxing executive director Paul Montville said the Illinois
Parole Board has approved Bennett's travel plans, and a verdict
from Australia is due in two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Bennett) has paid the price and tried to turn his life
around,'' Toney said. ``He is a fine individual, a fine person. I
can't imagine they won't let him in the country.''
</P>
<P>
   Toney said Palac has not made an official protest.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is unfortunate that one of our coaches would make such a
comment, and it is absolutely untrue,'' Toney said of the racism
charge. ``We want the very best boxers to advance to Sydney, and
that has nothing to do with race or ethnic background.''
</P>
<P>
   Palac said no white boxer has made the Olympic team since 1988.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't look at that as evidence,'' Toney said. ``The best
boxers won. Arthur Palac is a good boxer, but the judges felt he
did not win the fight.''

U.S. FOREIGN POLICY, THE DEMOCRATIC WAY

   &UR; (LAST IN A SERIES OF THREE ARTICLES. ALSO MOVING IN THE ``K''
CATEGORY  &UR; - RESENDING INHERITING-1, INHERITING-2 AND INHERITING-3
FOR THOSE WHO MAY HAVE MISSED THIS SPECIAL PACKAGE. The author
 &UR; examines the Democratic ``Liberal Moralist'' and ``Liberal
Realist''
 &UR; positions in the debate over the direction of American foreign
policy.)
</P>
<P>
   The American people are undergoing an out-of-body experience:
History is repeating itself, and they have been transferred back to
1920 and the battle waged by Woodrow Wilson and Henry Cabot Lodge
over America's entry into the League of Nations.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson wanted both to make the world ``safe for democracy'' and
for the United States to obey the covenant of the League of
Nations, irrespective of national self-interest. His opponent was
Lodge, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, and
although Lodge favored America's entry into the League, he wished
to modify certain articles as a means of preserving U.S. national
self-interest.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson refused to make any concessions and, in 1920, the League
went down to defeat. The conservatives of 2000 are the spiritual
descendants of Lodge, while present-day liberals inherit the legacy
of Wilson.
</P>
<P>
   As a liberal moralist, Clintonian foreign policy is an amalgam
of Wilson, Jimmy Carter's ``universal human rights'' and reaction
against the Vietnam War with its rejection of unilateral action by
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   After initial hesitation in 1993, Clintonian diplomacy shattered
the boundaries of the containment of Communism theory articulated
by George F. Kennan, a foreign-policy expert and diplomat, at the
beginning of the Cold War. Essentially a strategy to halt further
imperialism of the Stalinist empire, containment theory limited the
extension of American power to the Elbe, which, from 1947 to 1990,
was the eastern border of Germany. &QL; 
NATO EXPANSION &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Clintonian foreign policy committed itself to the enlargement of
the horizon of democracy, and Clinton pursued this goal on two
fronts: expansion of NATO in Europe and support of Boris Yeltsin in
Russia. When Clinton embarked on the jihad of making the world safe
for democracy, he not only embraced this aspect of Wilsonism but
capitulated to the arguments of Anthony Lake, his first national
security adviser.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton Doctrine brought Poland, the Czech Republic and
Hungary into NATO. By including these three countries under the
NATO umbrella, the United States committed itself to the defense of
countries it never previously considered within its own sphere of
national self-interest. This enormous broadening of American
guarantees was justified under the principle of missionary
democracy.
</P>
<P>
   In expanding NATO, Clinton broke American implied agreements
with Mikhail Gorbachev. ``A World Transformed,'' written by George
Bush, who was president at the time of the disintegration of the
Soviet Empire in Eastern Europe, and Brent Scowcroft, Bush's
national security adviser, is unequivocal on this point: At no time
did Bush, Scowcroft, or Secretary of 2RpO )M[Y

 CUP-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TONY CHAMBERLAIN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUCKLAND, New Zealand _ If you discount a few hundred
journalists rechecking their plane reservations, the only agony of
Sunday's nonrace day belonged to Italy's Prada.
</P>
<P>
   After all, the merchants, restaurateurs, and barkeeps around
this city could not be happier about more race cancellations.
Spread this thing out until June, for all they care. Saturday's
scheduled race was postponed because of light air. It was the third
such postponement of this America's Cup.
</P>
<P>
   Every day and night, the America's Cup Village is packed with a
growing crowd of Kiwis awaiting the coronation of their repeat
heavyweight champions.
</P>
<P>
   The Kiwi sailors are loving this. They find it increasingly
difficult to hide their cat-with-the-canary grins. Russell Coutts
was even seen smiling on the last leg of Race 3 Friday, something
out of character for the superfocused Kiwi skipper.
</P>
<P>
   The longer this Cup finale hangs on, the longer Team New Zealand
has to relish its moment in the sun. That moment could end this
week in an explosive celebration when the boats go out to race
Monday and Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Team New Zealand has a 3-0 lead over Prada in the best-of-nine
series.
</P>
<P>
   So only the Prada team is not enjoying this suspended lull of
windless high summer across New Zealand. More such weather is in
the forecast. How long, they wonder, must it take us to lose this
thing? ``Pradamania,'' which gripped Italy as nothing else has
since the country's World Cup-winning soccer team in the '80s, is
now a balloon without much air.
</P>
<P>
   But the Prada sailors are still talking bravely.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we can just win a start,'' said tactician Torben Grael.
``If we can win the start and get in the controlling position,
maybe we will be the boat with no passing lane.''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, maybe. And maybe if the Patriots learn to block, protect
the quarterback, develop a running game, and get receivers open,
they won't be the playthings of the NFL next season.
</P>
<P>
   The fact is, controlling the opposition is not something you
hope and pray for in a match race. It's something you earn.
</P>
<P>
   To date, the Kiwis have been dominant in every phase of sailboat
match racing. Their boat, NZ60, is faster over a range from 5 to 35
knots. There is no magic going on here, just a package that has
been optimized in every department.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past four years of development, said Tom Schnackenberg,
New Zealand's design coordinator and on-water navigator, ``we
worked out a relationship between the sailors and designers that
let us push every idea to the testing stage. If a sailor had an
idea, we'd try it and see if it worked. That's the relationship
that sailors and designers should have.''
</P>
<P>
   The result of such development has been telling. There has been
no one big breakthrough, like the famed revolutionary ``winged
keel'' of Australia II in 1983, but rather a long list of minute
improvements.
</P>
<P>
   According to Schnackenberg, when the Kiwis brought the Cup home
after their 5-0 thumping of Dennis Conner's team in 1995, they
decided to review every system and see how they could improve them.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from the longer waterline achieved by the spoon bow, or
``knuckle,'' just below the foredeck, these advances range from
their ``millennium'' rig to their gybing technique.
</P>
<P>
   ``All these little bits of things _ no one is that important,
but all together they make the boat that much faster,'' said Nippon
skipper Peter Gilmour.''
</P>
<P>
   Then there's the crew. Former Cup tactician and now TV sailing
analyst Gary Jobson put it this way:
</P>
<P>
   ``When I look at all 16 sailors on TNZ, and then took an
all-star team of the top 16 sailors from all the challengers, I
can't think of one Kiwi sailor I'd replace with one challenger team
member.''
</P>
<P>
   Prada's development was different. With superiority over most of
the challengers, Grael and skipper Francesco de Angelis learned to
win from a front-running position. Rarely did they fight from
behind until late in the challenger trials, when Paul Cayard's
AmericaOne forced Prada into its first hard-fought series of races.
</P>
<P>
   So facing this overwhelming mismatch against the Kiwis _ who are
now 8-0 in the America's Cup match races they have sailed since
1995 _ Prada's remaining hope is that it will be over soon.
</P>
<P>
   But, said Grael, they do have a strategy. Prada plans to sail a
superaggressive start and fight for the right, where, in steady
breezes, the control of the race is found.
</P>
<P>
   De Angelis and Grael have a slim chance of succeeding, even for
one race. But at least the next five minutes in this America's Cup
finale should be more interesting than the last six hours have
been.

DUCKS DEFEAT OILERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GREG CHRISTENSEN  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM -- Craig Hartsburg admitted it wasn't perfect, Teemu
Selanne said the performance wasn't pretty, but the Mighty Ducks
know they can't afford to be picky these days.
</P>
<P>
   And when compared to the recent crash-and-burns that Anaheim has
suffered through in recent weeks, Sunday's 3-2 over the Edmonton
Oilers before a sellout of 17,174 at The Pond ``was pretty sweet,''
according to Selanne.
</P>
<P>
   Not only did the Ducks pick up two desperately needed points,
they managed to hold a third-period lead and Guy Hebert made a
successful return to the nets after a nine-day boot camp of sorts
with goalie consultant Francois Allaire.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll only play if I'm playing well,'' said Hebert after the
Ducks held a team to less than three goals for the first time since
Feb. 1 (a span of nine games). ``We need somebody to drive the
car.'' After a series of sub-par performances, Hebert admitted he
was ``heavily motivated and excited to play'' and said he thought
about the game all day long.
</P>
<P>
   ``If things didn't weren't going to work out the way I wanted
them to, it wasn't going to be because of a lack of preperation,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Ducks as whole certainly came out motivated. They scored on
their second shot of the game -- Marty McInnis banging home a
rebound of a shot by Oleg Tverdovsky at 1:06. Anaheim made it 2-0
on its fourth shot, a nice three-way passing play that Fredrik
Olausson finished off at 2:32 by faking Edmonton goalie Tommy Salo
to the ice. Kevin Haller gave the Ducks a 3-0 lead at 19:07 when he
took Mike Leclerc's pass and beat Salo on the short side from 40
feet.
</P>
<P>
   But as has been well documented, the Ducks hadn't dealt with
success well in the six previous games -- blowing two-goal leads in
five of them and settling for a 2-2-2 record in that stretch. And
history looked as if it was going to repeat itself on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Edmonton cut Anaheim's lead to two just 8.4 seconds after
Haller's goal when Ethan Moreau scored. The Oilers pulled within
3-2 at 10:35 of the second period when Leclerc lost track of Jim
Dowd in the slot and the winger beat Hebert easily.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if we got scared or what because the second
period was awful,'' said Teemu Selanne.
</P>
<P>
   Things didn't look particular good for the Ducks -- considering
that Edmonton has outscored its opponents 60-44 in the third
period, while the Ducks have been blitzed 67-49 in the final
period.
</P>
<P>
   But for the first weeks Anaheim appeared confident in the last
20 minutes and as result the Ducks (26-27-10-1) pulled within four
points of San Jose and Colorado in the battle for the final playoff
spot in the Western Conference. Tuesday they will have a chance to
draw within two of the Sharks when they play in San Jose.
</P>
<P>
   ``We finally showed some good poise and character,'' said
Hebert. ``I felt everyone had learned a lesson.
</P>
<P>
   ``Between periods I was thinking there's no way I'm giving up a
goal and think everybody else felt the same way. As the period went
on we played with more confidence.''
</P>
<P>
   Confidence was something Hebert has been searching for, and he
picked up a great deal of it when he slid across the crease to stop
Todd Marchant on a two-on-one shorthanded break early in the second
period.
</P>
<P>
   ``I read the pass and got over there,'' he said. ``That's a save
I haven't been able to make lately, so it felt good.''
</P>
<P>
   Hebert also stopped the speedy Marchant on a breakaway with a
minute left in the second period.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was probably the biggest save of the game,'' said
Hartsburg.
</P>
<P>
   Hebert, who stopped 25 of 27 shots, certainly was spectacular,
but the Anaheim coach said ``Guy doesn't have to be spectacular, he
has to be solid.''
</P>
<P>
   And Hebert was just that, much to the delight of his teammates.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's our guy, if we want to go any further we need him,'' said
Tverdovsky. ``We need him, he's a huge part of our team. He was
great tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   ``For any team goaltending is huge,'' said Selanne. ``He's
hungry and he's back. It's great to see him with his confidence
back.''

PATRIOTS ADD BJORNSON TO BACKUP FILE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NICK CAFARDO  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ The Patriots' search for second-tier players
led them to tight end Eric Bjornson over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   The former Cowboy, 28, was a backup for David LaFleur the past
two seasons. Bjornson has been plagued by injuries, starting only
nine games the last two years after starting 24 in 1996 and 1997.
He caught only 10 passes last season for 131 yards and no
touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   No contract details were available on Bjornson.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in this free agent period, the Patriots signed running
back Raymont Harris, who missed the entire 1999 season.
</P>
<P>
   Bjornson is represented by agent Leigh Steinberg, which could
mean the Patriots and Steinberg are discussing a new deal for
quarterback Drew Bledsoe as well.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots released five-time All-Pro tight end Ben Coates
earlier this offseason and will throw Bjornson in with Rod Rutledge
to compete for the starting job.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots signed wide receiver Troy Brown to a five-year, $13
million deal Saturday. They have now signed two of their own free
agents _ the other is strong safety Lawyer Milloy _ and have let
guard Heath Irwin (Miami), cornerback Steve Israel, wide receiver
Shawn Jefferson (Atlanta), and defensive end Chris Sullivan
(Pittsburgh) seek other deals. The Patriots may still sign
linebacker Tedy Bruschi.

THE LAST STRAW, AT LAST
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TOM HOFFARTH  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Maybe today, we'll find out if Darryl Strawberry
has any lifelines left in his version of ``Who Wants to be a
Million-Airhead?''
</P>
<P>
   Buddy Boy Selig's final answer shouldn't have anything to do
with the precedent set by those before him who perpetuated Steve
``Snow Day'' Howe's situation until it reached ridiculous
proportions.
</P>
<P>
   Here, a lifetime ban, not just a one-season ban, is the
statement that needs to be made for baseball's version of Ike
Turner. The other three major pro leagues wouldn't tolerate a third
drug-related lapse. Why does hardball have a soft core?
</P>
<P>
   Selig has used the ``integrity of the game'' stance to keep Pete
Rose's lifetime-ban appeal for gambling from even being considered
again. Straw's been gambling, too - with his life. He should be
held to the same standards and practices.
</P>
<P>
   Various employers (including the Dodgers) have done more than
required to assist this employee in getting treatment, but when he
plainly violates probation terms less than a year after we
applauded him for beating cancer, maybe it's a sign for him to try
another profession. One where $30 million (his lifetime earnings)
aren't so easily at his disposal, for starters.
</P>
<P>
   We feel for ya, Straw. We tried. Time to stop rolling the
dice....
</P>
<P>
   Just as stock in Strawberry crashes, the company known as
YankeeNets, which runs the New York Yankees and New Jersey Nets, is
selling $250 million in high-risk junk bonds to complete the
acquisition of the baseball team. The company, already $380 million
in debt, is also trying to buy the New Jersey Devils....
</P>
<P>
   Maybe this is a shot in the dark, but putting a bow and arrow in
the hands of Justin Huish right now doesn't sound like such a smart
idea....
</P>
<P>
   New Blue Jays outfielder Raul Mondesi told the Toronto Globe and
Mail: ``Some people say there's too much pressure for the players
in L.A. People say a lot of things, you can't concentrate.... I was
in a slump for a couple of weeks (last year) and a lot of people
started to say something and talk a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   So, what about the fact new teammate David Wells has complained
about the team getting Mondesi in exchange for Shawn Green? Mondesi
has justified that in his head by answering: ``Some people told me
he said some things. To me, that doesn't matter.''
</P>
<P>
   What your teammates say doesn't matter, but what fans say
does?...
</P>
<P>
   After what happened at the Grammys, Rafael Santana should
consider a comeback....
</P>
<P>
   Steve Lavin has the rollover contract. His players just roll
over....
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Harrick, our IRS agent will see you now. And bring your
son....
</P>
<P>
   Stop releasing tapes of 911 calls to the public through the
media. It is one of the most invasive, unnecessary acts of non-news
judgment ever allowed.
</P>
<P>
   That said, the most hilarious clip in circulation is Tonya
Harding's boyfriend making his distress call after she allegedly
smacked him in the nose with a hubcap....
</P>
<P>
   As far as Kings fans are concerned, Marty McSorley need not
worry about being remembered as a stick-swinging maniac. He'll
always be a blade-bending meathead....
</P>
<P>
   Ray Romano just finished his round at Pebble Beach....
</P>
<P>
   Two events the Los Angeles Sports and Entertainment Commission
has targeted to get are the 2003 NBA All-Star Game and the 2006
U.S. Open golf tournament....
</P>
<P>
   So was that dress supposed to distract people from looking at
Jennifer Lopez's backside?

GYORFFY SETS COLLEGIATE MARK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN VELLANTE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HANOVER, N.H. _ Early Saturday afternoon, Harvard coach Frank
Haggerty said his prized high jumper was ``in a class by herself.''
</P>
<P>
   Less than 24 hours later, Dora Gyorffy proved her coach right.
</P>
<P>
   Gyorffy, the Budapest native with an eye on the Olympics,
cleared the bar at an NCAA record-tying 6 feet 5 1/2 inches to
highlight the 53d Heptagonal Championships at Dartmouth's Leverone
Field House.
</P>
<P>
   That, along with the superb performance of Brenda Taylor, who
won the 55 high hurdles, 55 meters, and 200 meters, helped propel
Harvard (109 points) to its first Heptagonal title in a decade.
Brown (92 points) and Cornell (69) wrapped up the women's top
three. Princeton (121.33 points) won the men's championship for the
third straight time, ahead of Brown (90) and Navy (88).
</P>
<P>
   Gyorffy leaped her way to a share of the record set by Amy Acuff
of UCLA in the NCAA Championships in 1995 and equaled by Erin
Aldrich of Texas in the Canon Invitational in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Gyorffy raised the bar to 6-6 3/4 in an attempt to set a new
record. She failed in two attempts and bypassed the third when the
side of her shoe tore away.
</P>
<P>
   It was the third time in as many years that Gyorffy has set the
Heptagonal record. As a freshman in 1998, she jumped 6-3 1/4 to
shatter the previous standard by 5 inches; last year, she added a
quarter-inch to that with a leap of 6-3 1/2. Sunday's jump beat her
career best of 6-4 1/4.
</P>
<P>
   Gyorffy, who won Sunday when Princeton's Shawneequa Callier
failed in three attempts to clear 6- 1/4, wasted no time in inching
her way to the record-tying jump. On her first tries, she easily
hit 6-2, 6-3 1/4, and 6-4 1/4. She missed her first attempt at 6-5
1/2, but on her second, went over with room to spare.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I could have set (the record) if my shoe hadn't
split,'' said Gyorffy. ``It tore apart just when I planted and it
affected my plant. I'm so pleased, though, because it's the
second-best jump in the world this year. I still can't believe
it.''
</P>
<P>
   The record-tying high jump was just the beginning for Gyorffy.
An hour later, she moved over to the triple jump pit and won with a
Harvard-record leap of 41-9 3/4, breaking by an inch her own mark.
</P>
<P>
   The record-tying and record-setting efforts earned Gyorffy her
third straight Heptagonal Outstanding Performer Award.
</P>
<P>
   As great as Gyorffy's performance was, one can't overlook the 30
points Taylor brought to the table. She edged her twin sister,
Lindsay, of Brown, in the hurdles and breezed in the 55 and 200
meters. When Taylor and teammate Marna Schutte finished 1-2 in the
200, the combined 18 points put them ahead of Brown _ and they
never looked back. Schutte also won the 400 and anchored Harvard's
winning 4 x 400 relay team.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, they're fabulous talents who don't know how to
lose,'' said Haggerty of Gyorffy and Taylor, who combined for 50 of
Harvard's 109 points. ``They gave us everything we expected of
them.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Dartmouth's men enjoyed a slight lead on Princeton before Scott
Denbo won the shot with a throw of 59-3 1/2 to put the Tigers in
front for good. When John Mack followed by winning the 400 meters,
and Ryan Smith, Chris McFadden, and Matthew Notary went 2-3-4 in
the 800, Princeton was home free . . . The Harvard men finished
last in the nine-team field with 19.33 points.

SPARKY AWAITS CALL FROM HALL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   THOUSAND OAKS - The essential story about George ``Sparky''
Anderson and his suburban home of 33 years concerns the winter day
a pair of strangers tailed him from the neighborhood Thrifty and
parked in front of his house.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson approached the car and asked if he could help. One of
the men said he was a baseball fan from Michigan who just wanted to
see where the Detroit Tigers' manager lived.
</P>
<P>
   They talked sports for a few minutes. Then the tourist from
Michigan summed up his brief sightseeing experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a little disappointed,'' he said to Anderson, ``in the
house.'' He explained that he expected the great Sparky, making $1
million a year in Detroit, to spend offseasons in something more
palatial.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went inside and told Carol, `Some guy just said he's
disappointed in the house!'' Anderson recalled a few days ago.
``She said, `He didn't!' I said, `He did!' ''
</P>
<P>
   Suffice to say the Andersons weren't shamed into moving - and
probably never will move. It's only Sparky's baseball legacy that's
about to get a fancy new address.
</P>
<P>
   Barring a miscarriage of justice, the lone manager to win World
Series with teams from both major leagues will receive his ticket
to Cooperstown on Tuesday, when the veterans committee is scheduled
to meet in Tampa to select new members for the Hall of Fame.
</P>
<P>
   The telephone call should come late in the morning, the official
invitation for Anderson to be inducted on July 23, along with his
old Cincinnati Reds first baseman Tony Perez, voted into the Hall
of Fame by writers in January.
</P>
<P>
   The anticipation will force a rare break from Anderson's daily
routine.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll be nervous (awaiting the call), yes, very nervous, I
wouldn't kid nobody,'' Anderson said, animated as ever, in the
lunch room at Sunset Hills Country Club, where he plays golf a
three-minute drive from his house. ``People ask me, do you want it?
Absolutely!
</P>
<P>
   ``That's something that stays here for eternity. Until God
decides to destroy this world, your ancestors will always be able
to go there and see you. Can you imagine your grandkids - and their
grandkids - saying, `Man, my grandpa, he's up there!' That's quite
a thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't mean you would walk with any arrogance,'' he added.
``But I'll tell you this: Inside you'll walk prouder than a
peacock.''
</P>
<P>
   If Anderson, who turned 66 last Tuesday, were inclined toward
arrogance, he could have started long before now. In addition to
winning World Series with the National League's Reds (1975-76) and
the American League's Tigers (1984), he's the only manager to
record 100-win seasons in both leagues (Cincinnati, 1970, 1975,
1976, and Detroit, 1984), and trails only Connie Mack and John
McGraw in career victories (2,194).
</P>
<P>
   Arrogance? He walks and talks with what seems to be a practiced
modesty, saying he never considered his Hall of Fame chances until
a couple of years before his 1995 retirement, and continuing to
speak with uncertainty (``if that would happen ...'') about making
it.
</P>
<P>
   Arrogance bugs him.
</P>
<P>
   ``The trouble with the people who are more fortunate (is) they
think that's the way it's supposed to be,'' Anderson said, shifting
in his chair. ``They just (begin ital)happen(end ital) to be more
fortunate. I don't pretend to be better than anybody. But I do know
I was more fortunate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know that if I hadn't gone to Cincinnati in 1970, you
wouldn't be asking me about the Hall of Fame. The Hall of Fame for
what, painters?''
</P>
<P>
   Anderson's dad was a house painter. He moved the family from
Bridgewater, S.D., population 632, to Los Angeles when George was
9. They lived a block and a half from USC and George became the
batboy for Rod Dedeaux's Trojans. George rode the bus to Dorsey
High, instead of his neighborhood school, because Dorsey had a
baseball team.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would not trade one moment of my time at 35th and Vermont,''
Anderson said. ``It made me understand all the different types of
people. All people are good and all people are bad. You can't label
people.''
</P>
<P>
   He and Carol, whom he'd met in grade school, had lived in Canoga
Park while he worked the assortment of coaching, minor-league
managing and non-baseball jobs that bridged his Pacific Coast
League playing days and the start of his 26-year major-league
managing career.
</P>
<P>
   ``We couldn't afford to buy in the (San Fernando) Valley. And we
couldn't afford to buy here (in Thousand Oaks) except my
father-in-law gave us $8,000,'' Anderson said. ``People ask, `How
come you stayed? You have that same house.' I say, `One, out of
fear of my father-in-law.' He helped us build this house. I didn't
know what he'd think if we moved.''
</P>
<P>
   Anderson came home to Thousand Oaks for good in 1995, resigning
from the Tigers at the end of the season, worn out by a weak team
and the lingering unpleasantness of the strike, during which he'd
taken a principled stand and forfeited $150,000 in salary by
refusing to manage a ``replacement'' team in spring training.
</P>
<P>
   ``What in the heck am I doing here?'' he'd thought while wearily
watching ``Oprah'' in a hotel room in Chicago one day that summer,
``when I could be home, starting to learn to enjoy life?''
</P>
<P>
   Not until July 1999, when he needed triple-bypass surgery after
feeling ill during a celebrity golf tournament in Ann Arbor, Mich.,
did Anderson realize the fatigue that prompted his retirement at 61
might have been caused by his heart.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way I feel right now,'' he said seven months after the
surgery, ``if that had been back then, like an idiot I'd still be
working.''
</P>
<P>
   After the surgery, Anderson had to make some changes, giving the
hook to Mexican food, cheeseburgers, pizza and his beloved pipe, as
quickly as he used to give the hook to wild pitchers.
</P>
<P>
   His day begins before 7 a.m. with an hour's walk through the
neighborhood. Then, a breakfast heavy on juices and fruit. Next,
errands, and then, five days a week, 18 holes at Sunset Hills.
</P>
<P>
   He walks the course, too, now. He calculates he walks 35 miles a
week.
</P>
<P>
   His stint as an Angels TV analyst is over. ``Me, broadcasting,
is the Peter Principle,'' he said. ``If I wasn't Sparky Anderson
and had managed all that time and been in five World Series, I
wouldn't be sitting behind that mike. I didn't kid myself about
that. I'm goofy as a jaybird, but I never kid myself.''
</P>
<P>
   Among his friends, and in his family of three children and 14
grandchildren, he is George, not Sparky. The nickname attached to
him by a minor-league radio announcer in the 1950s applies to the
extroverted public figure, not the introverted homebody who often
is in his pajamas in time for the 6 o'clock news.
</P>
<P>
   He rarely ventures into Los Angeles, claims never to have been
to ``an L.A. party,'' and leaves California for speaking
engagements reluctantly.
</P>
<P>
   Companies pay him to connect dugout wisdom to business, and he
tells them what he thinks - whether they like it or not.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think so many CEOs make a terrible mistake. They want the
people working for them to understand them,'' Anderson said. ``The
CEO that's good at his job understands his workers. The only way
you can ever have respect (from employees) is if you earn it.''
</P>
<P>
   What makes a good manager or coach, he'll tell the businessmen,
is getting good players to follow you.
</P>
<P>
   ``I laugh in hysterics when I see (managers) with their books
(of statistics),'' Anderson said. ``We are not Harvard professors,
and my IQ might be 35. But you don't need an IQ to manage. All you
need is a pair of eyes and the ability to talk to somebody.
</P>
<P>
   ``Baseball is so simple. There's two kinds of managers. There's
the `moron' who gets bad players and loses. Then there's the
`Einstein' who gets good players and lets them - lets them - win a
lot of games, and hangs around a long time.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to have talent and them get 'em to follow you,'' he
said. ``The impact of a Johnny Wooden is he made them follow him. I
think Phil Jackson's doing that now with the Lakers. He's (saying),
`Just follow me. Give it a chance.' If you can get talent to follow
you, oh my goodness ...''
</P>
<P>
   They'll follow you all the way to the Hall of Fame.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson's teams twice played exhibition games near the Hall of
Fame. He attended Tom Lasorda's induction in 1997. (Lasorda was
eligible for the Hall of Fame as soon as he retired because he was
over 65. Anderson has had to wait until five years after he
retired.)
</P>
<P>
   But Anderson has never actually been inside the Hall of Fame. In
a nod to superstition, he decided never to tour it until he became
a member.
</P>
<P>
   That should happen Tuesday. If he belongs anywhere but in
Thousand Oaks, it's in Cooperstown.

REID-TRINIDAD IS HUGE GAMBLE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MICHAEL ROSENTHAL  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK - Rumors in the boxing world are that the Felix
Trinidad-David Reid fight on Friday in Las Vegas might not come
off.
</P>
<P>
   Don't believe it. The promotion has picked up too much momentum
to turn back now.
</P>
<P>
   But make no mistake: At least a small part of promoter Don King
would love to scrap the fight at the last minute because he and
others - including Trinidad, his client - stand to lose a fortune
on two fronts.
</P>
<P>
   It's estimated that he'll need a pay-per-view audience of at
least 400,000 to break even when a more realistic number might be
closer to 100,000. At the same time, the live gate at Caesars
Palace isn't expected to be overwhelming.
</P>
<P>
   Rival promoter Bob Arum said King could lose $5 million on the
fight and he might not be far off.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's the proposed two-fight deal between Trinidad and De
La Hoya - who knocked out Derrell Coley here on Saturday - on June
10 and in September in which the fighters would share a monstrous
$80 million if they can reach terms.
</P>
<P>
   The catch is Friday's fight: If Trinidad loses - which many
experts believe is likely - the deal with De La Hoya is off.
</P>
<P>
   Forty million each ... down the drain ... just like that.
</P>
<P>
   Trinidad, who might never again command that kind of money, will
make a relatively paltry $4 million (to Reid's $3 million) for
Friday's fight.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, the decision to fight Reid, made in good part because King
didn't want to be dictated to by Arum, is among the most stupid in
the history of boxing from a business perspective.
</P>
<P>
   ``To take that kind of risk for $4 million instead of $20
million to fight De La Hoya may prove to be the worst business
decision in sports since the Red Sox traded Babe Ruth,'' one boxing
insider said.
</P>
<P>
   Only one thing could be more stupid: If Trinidad wins and he
(begin ital)still(end ital) doesn't agree to fight De La Hoya.
</P>
<P>
   Remarkably, that's possible given that Felix Trinidad Sr., the
fighter's father and tzar of his camp, has been reluctant to
compromise on any aspect of on-going negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   The key sticking point could be weight.
</P>
<P>
   Arum, De La Hoya's promoter, and King, who handles Trinidad,
have a working agreement that the fight would take place at a catch
weight of 151 pounds - about midway between the welterweight and
junior middleweight limits.
</P>
<P>
   But neither De La Hoya, who fights at 147 pounds, nor Trinidad,
who has moved up to 154, has agreed to compromise.
</P>
<P>
   Somehow, it's difficult to believe they wouldn't. Forty million
dollars is quite an incentive.
</P>
<P>
   Interested bystander: Shane Mosley of Pomona will be rooting for
Reid on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   If Trinidad loses, the former lightweight champion is expected
to fight De La Hoya on June 17 at Staples Center in his first truly
big-money, big-exposure fight.
</P>
<P>
   Negotiations already are under way for that fight.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes me a little uncomfortable having to wait to see
what's going to happen,'' Mosley said. ``That's the way it is if
you're following isn't as big as some fighters (read: De La Hoya).
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully, everything will work out and (begin ital)I'll(end
ital) have that kind of following and be in a better position.''
</P>
<P>
   The Staples Center is holding the date in the event Trinidad
loses and the De La Hoya and Mosley camps can reach an agreement.
</P>
<P>
   If Trinidad wins and ends up fighting De La Hoya again? Mosley
said he'll probably fight WBA welterweight champ James Page and
ultimately would like to unify the welterweight titles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to fight everyone in the division - everyone,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Job well done: De La Hoya fought the right fight against Coley:
He fought with controlled aggression.
</P>
<P>
   He didn't run, as he did in the first Trinidad fight. And he
didn't bang, as he did in the second fight with Julio Cesar Chavez.
He found a happy - and efficient - medium that might best suit him
the rest of his career.
</P>
<P>
   His performance might've been more striking had Coley
cooperated. But Coley realized early in the fight that he was in
over his head and settled into survival mode.
</P>
<P>
   And when a skillful boxer such as Coley decides he doesn't want
to fight, it's very difficult to catch him with many meaningful
punches.
</P>
<P>
   In that sense, De La Hoya did all he could do.
</P>
<P>
   ``I chopped him down,'' he said. ``It's like a tree. You take
out the bottom and the whole thing falls down.''
</P>
<P>
   Was he? Was De La Hoya hurt early in the fourth round?
</P>
<P>
   Coley, who landed a right to De La Hoya's head that appeared to
at least stun him for a few dramatic moments, said ``I know'' I
hurt him.
</P>
<P>
   De La Hoya denied it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't hurt,'' he said. ``When he had the confidence to
throw combinations, at the same time, I was thinking it's a matter
of time that he'll get tired. I wasn't throwing punches back
because I was kinda like bringing him in, opening the door so he
could get tired.
</P>
<P>
   `` ... It was part of like a little game plan we had, but he
never did hurt me, I'll be honest with you.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of those at ringside believe otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   Clarification: De La Hoya backed off somewhat from his threat to
boycott the major sanctioning bodies.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all know that we have to pay sanction fees and I personally
think it's a lot of money,'' he said. ``I have to be very smart
about it. I'm not going to give my money away.
</P>
<P>
   ``...It may be about negotiating and finding out what
organizations are respectable. ... I have to really think about who
I'm going to fight for.''
</P>
<P>
   De La Hoya won the fringe IBA title on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Mismatch: Arturo Gatti's brutal knockout of Joey Gamache on the
De La Hoya-Coley undercard magnified a serious problem in boxing.
</P>
<P>
   The fighters weighed in Friday at 141 pounds. But at fight time,
Gatti weighed 160 to Gamache's 146. It was like a middleweight
fighting a welterweight.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a physical mismatch,'' said Lou DiBella of HBO. ``You
don't have to be a rocket scientist to see that that's dangerous.''
</P>
<P>
   Fighters should be weighed a second time on fight night and
scratched if they balloon more than a designated number of pounds.
</P>
<P>
   Holyfield watch: It's hard to imagine Evander Holyfield in
anything but a megafight at this stage of his career.
</P>
<P>
   But his tentative bout with No. 1 WBA heavyweight contender John
Ruiz on May 27 in Las Vegas is hardly compelling, even if it turns
out to be for the WBA version of the heavyweight title.
</P>
<P>
   Most likely, the fight would be for the No. 1 ranking and the
right to fight for Lennox Lewis' WBA crown. But King, Holyfield's
promoter, reportedly is pushing the WBA to strip Lewis of his title
because King says Lewis reneged on an agreement reached before he
beat Holyfield to fight the top WBA contender.
</P>
<P>
   How good is Ruiz? He was knocked out in 19 seconds by David Tua.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis is scheduled to defend the unified heavyweight titles
against Michael Grant on April 29 at Madison Square Garden in New
York.
</P>
<P>
   Rabbit punches: Former six-time world champion Julio Cesar
Chavez will face journeyman Bobby Elkins in a 12-round welterweight
bout on the Reid-Trinidad card, although rumors are that Chavez has
threatened to pull out unless his purse is increased.
</P>
<P>
   Chavez is expected to face WBC junior welterweight Kostya Tszyu
if he wins. ...
</P>
<P>
   In all the hoopla surrounding the De La Hoya and Trinidad-Reid
fights, a bout between WBA bantamweight champion Paulie Ayala, The
Ring magazine's fighter of the year for 1999, and Johnny Bredahl
has been lost.
</P>
<P>
   The fight is scheduled for Saturday at the Mandalay Bay in Las
Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   Oba Carr will face Yory Boy Campas in an interesting junior
middleweight bout on the card. ...
</P>
<P>
   Correction: The result of the second Marco Antonio
Barrera-Junior Jones fight was incorrectly reported.
</P>
<P>
   Jones won by decision, not by a knockout. &QL;

KATIE COURIC OF NBC LEADS THE MORNING PACK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY DAVID KRONKE 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR;  LOS ANGELES _ As its morning show ratings fell last spring,
ABC brought back former morning hosts Charles Gibson and Diane
Sawyer and built an $80 million set overlooking Times Square in New
York City.
</P>
<P>
   As ratings fell last fall, CBS recruited its high-priced, failed
prime-time star Bryant Gumbel, dropped $30 million on its Central
Park-adjacent set and hired the mastermind behind the ``Today''
show's success, Steve Friedman.
</P>
<P>
   NBC did nothing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today's'' Katie Couric still reigns supreme in the network
morning TV competition.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are people who don't watch CBS because they don't like
Bryant Gumbel,'' observes Robert Thompson, founding director of the
Center of the Study of Popular Television and a professor of film
and television at Syracuse University.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are some who don't watch ABC because they don't like the
people on that show. But there's no one who doesn't watch NBC
because they don't like Katie. (italics) No one (end italics)
doesn't like Katie.''
</P>
<P>
   Morning is the only time period in which network TV viewership
is expanding _ unemployment has been down for several years, so
more people are simply getting up to go to work and flipping on the
set. Thus, competition in that lucrative 7-to-9 a.m. time slot has
heated up.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today'' has been the No. 1 morning show for five consecutive
years, boasting 6.3 million viewers daily; the show cleared a
reported $100 million in profit last year.
</P>
<P>
   ABC's ``Good Morning America,'' averages 4.2 million viewers;
``The Early Show,'' CBS's umpteenth revamping of its morning news
program, trails with 2.7million viewers.
</P>
<P>
   The morning's biggest audience isn't even watching television _
National Public Radio's ``Morning Edition'' draws 8.8 million
listeners daily.
</P>
<P>
   Morning, coincidentally, is the time when the audience's viewing
habits are most firmly entrenched, and ``Today,'' which has been on
the air nearly half a century, has become for many a morning
tradition.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a bigger hill to climb than nearly any time slot,''
Thompson says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Morning is logically the time when the remote is least in use
_ you're running all over. The tendency is to settle on one show
and watch it throughout. And that tradition is to watch `Today' _
and it has extended for generations. There's not that habit for
CBS. In fact, the habit for generations is (italics) not (end
italics) to watch CBS, and they've gotten good at it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Five years on top is an eternity,'' notes Steve Friedman,
executive producer of ``The Early Show.'' Before his current job,
Friedman spearheaded ``Today's'' march to the top. ``Part of it is
`Today's' a good show; they have great people both on camera and
behind it. But much of that time, `Today' had no real
competition.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Before Diane and Charles came back, there was not a ton of
competition in the morning,'' agrees ``Today'' spokeswoman Allison
Gollust.
</P>
<P>
   ``The additional competition makes us work harder. We can't get
complacent. Just because you're on top today doesn't mean you'll be
there always. No one is just kicking back and enjoying the view.''
</P>
<P>
   Part of the success of ``Today'' seems to be the chemistry
between Couric and co-anchor Matt Lauer.
</P>
<P>
   ``NBC was extremely fortunate that we got Matt and Katie at the
same time,'' admits Gollust.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both of them are highly talented individuals, and for them to
have walked through the doors at the same time and turned up on our
morning show is a huge reason why the show does so well. That
chemistry is not something you can just make happen.''
</P>
<P>
   That chemistry attracts the audience _ both television viewers
and New York City tourists standing outside the show's ground floor
studio windows at Rockefeller Plaza. The window segment was brought
back to the ``Today'' show five years ago to wild success. Dave
Garroway first used it in the 1950s when the ``Today'' show set the
standard for morning TV.
</P>
<P>
   In adding their own outdoors segments, Thompson says, ABC and
CBS look like copycats.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those segments are always specious, five minutes of people
giving T-shirts to the weatherman. But they make the show appear
open and friendly _ that's what CBS is responding to, but they're
so pathetic to follow in those footsteps.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, CBS's fortunes have bewildered many industry observers.
Lori Robinson, assistant managing editor for the American
Journalism Review magazine, says, ``I'm surprised it hasn't done
better. There was so much hype before it came on, and lots of
people respect Bryant. I thought people would be interested in
tuning in to see the show, but that hasn't happened. I'm not sure
what CBS can do to turn things around.''
</P>
<P>
   Friedman concedes that outside of staging live executions of
millionaires, CBS's options to increase its viewership are limited.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our position is it's almost impossible to do anything
significant to change the equation _ the other side has got to
(screw) up for you to grow. It's difficult to get them to change.
It's extremely difficult for us.''
</P>
<P>
   A possible window of opportunity could open for CBS after the
May sweeps period, when Charles Gibson or Diane Sawyer, or both,
may exit ``Good Morning America.''

LOS ANGELES: Morning America.'' 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients)
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``GMA'' executive producer Shelley Ross says, ``Charles and
Diane are having a ball _ they're excited to come in; they like
each other and the show.''
</P>
<P>
   But industry observers find it hard to believe that Gibson and
Sawyer, who can call their own shots, will stick around forever.
ABC already has credible possible replacements for them in Jack
Ford and Elizabeth Vargas.
</P>
<P>
   ``There isn't a time frame, but we will never again surprise
viewers with some radical change,'' Ross says, referring to times
in the past when new anchors such as Lisa McRee were foisted on the
audience, to extreme indifference.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever happens will occur over a slow period of time. It
will be a transition that viewers will be in on.''
</P>
<P>
   Robinson observes: ``Anchors make a huge difference. If Gibson
and Sawyer leave and viewers are not happy, certainly, that's a big
chance for CBS to do something.''
</P>
<P>
   Much of the focus of CBS's hopes for ``The Early Show'' _ as
well as its woes _ has centered on Bryant Gumbel, who was a 15-year
veteran of ``Today'' and hosted a failed prime-time news magazine
on CBS, ``Public Eye.'' Gumbel's professionalism has never been
questioned; how viewers perceive his sometimes prickly personality
and his personal life is another matter. He didn't win many fans
when he slagged Couric in an interview last year, and now he's
going through a messy divorce.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a great asset to the people who like him, and a liability
to the people who don't,'' Thompson says. ``He's a celebrity, and
he carries the baggage of someone with a public image.''
</P>
<P>
   CBS's Friedman responds: ``He's the best live interviewer on
morning TV; he brings a heft to the show. The show got instant
credibility when he signed on. There's no one better in the morning
arena. His edge is what morning TV lacks. Anyone who doesn't like
him, I invite them to watch the other morning shows.''
</P>
<P>
   A spotlight has also turned on co-anchor Jane Clayson, a
heretofore unknown who, most critics suggest, appears out of her
element.
</P>
<P>
   Friedman defends her, saying, ``Jane is coming on like
gangbusters.'' When Bryant was in Florida hosting a charity event,
Friedman says, ``She ran the show, and she was crisp and
confident.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, on Friday, news reporter Julie Chen handled the
hard-news interviews on the death penalty and drugs in sports;
Clayson contributed a fluff piece on attending a movie premiere.
</P>
<P>
   CBS has suffered through a revolving-door programming policy in
its morning block for nearly 20 years. Whatever it has been called
_ ``The Morning Program,'' ``CBS Morning News'' or, more recently,
``CBS This Morning,'' it has failed.
</P>
<P>
   ``CBS This Morning'' was roundly considered a flop, but since
its incarnation, ``The Early Show'' has struggled even to match
that program's ratings.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a really bad sign,'' says Thompson. ``When you start
something new and the numbers go up just a little, that's a little
disappointing. But if you do something entirely new and the results
go down _ that's saying something that has to be dealt with.''
</P>
<P>
   CBS was successful before it went the news route, when it aired
the long-running children's series ``Captain Kangaroo.''
</P>
<P>
   Says Thompson: ``CBS never did better than when they had
`Captain Kangaroo.' When he left the air, it was a sad, sad day.''

NEBRASKA CORNERBACK TRIES TO CATCH THEIR EYE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By FRANK C. GIRARDOT  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS - As a college football player, Ralph Brown, a
cornerback for the Nebraska Cornhuskers, was nothing but special.
</P>
<P>
   Brown, a graduate of Bishop Amat High in La Puente, Calif.,
earned a unique distinction this season when he became the only
Cornhuskers non-kicker since World War II to start every game of
his career.
</P>
<P>
   Attending the annual scouting combine in Indianapolis this
weekend, Brown is hoping that his track record for longevity will
translate into a roster spot somewhere in the league for the 2000
season.
</P>
<P>
   The NFL brought more than 300 of the nation's top players to the
combine, where the athletes will undergo a battery of physical and
psychological tests that could determine their pro future.
</P>
<P>
   Doing well can make a player an early-round draft pick. Doing
poorly might guarantee a one-way ticket to NFL Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Through the first day of workouts for defensive backs, Brown
said he was comfortable.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know what to expect at first, but it's not as bad as
some of the players make it out to be,'' Brown said as he carried a
set of X-rays from the RCA dome to his room at the Indianapolis
Crown Plaza.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of the coaches are nice, and I'm just taking everything
with a grain of salt and I enjoy being here.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown is part of a class of defensive backs that includes likely
first-rounders Mario Edwards of Florida State and Dwyane Goodrich
of Tennessee. But, he's not fazed by the competition.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just try to stay relaxed and focused and not worry about
everybody else,'' Brown said. ``The reason I'm here is to try to
raise my stock and meet the coaches. Hopefully they'll like me.''
</P>
<P>
   Just about every NFL team has interviewed Brown and he expects
to undergo more interviews before the combine ends this evening.
Like everyone else, he's also met with several doctors and
trainers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had to meet with every doctor,'' he said. ``You go through
the same thing every time. They check your knees, back, shoulders
everything.''
</P>
<P>
   A cursory background check would reveal some pretty impressive
facts about Brown.
</P>
<P>
   This year, Brown, 5-foot-9 and 184 pounds, was selected as one
of 12 semifinalists for the Jim Thorpe Award, which is given to the
nation's premier defensive back.
</P>
<P>
   Brown started every game of his career at Nebraska and set
school records for breakups in a game (seven), season (14) and
career (42).
</P>
<P>
   In 1999, Brown led a Huskers defense that ranked in the top
eight in all four defensive categories, including seventh in
passing efficiency and third in total defense.
</P>
<P>
   His Nebraska coaches know exactly what Brown brings to a team.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the ... years I have worked with Ralph Brown, he has only
played at one speed,'' Nebraska secondary coach George Darlington
said. ``There has never been one instance, not in practice or in a
game, where he didn't go 100 percent. As a coach, I appreciate
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of his fortunes over the next few months, Brown said
he is content with what he has accomplished so far.
</P>
<P>
   ``I reached a lot of goals and more goals that I never even
thought of, like starting every game for four years,'' he said.
``Just being All-American and one of the highly touted cornerbacks,
so I've achieved a lot of my goals that I set out before going to
college.''

SORRY ENDING FOR McSORLEY 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GREG CHRISTENSEN  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Marty McSorley's legacy is now complete. The
former Kings defenseman will not be remembered as a marginally
talented player who worked hard and actually rose above his
so-called ``enforcer'' status, especially during his years with the
Kings. Instead, McSorley will be remembered as a guy who didn't
have the foresight to use a legal stick in a crucial moment of the
Kings' only Stanley Cup finals appearance, and the pathetic figure
left near tears after inexcusably slashing Vancouver's Donald
Brashear in the side of the head last Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   His image could, and did, survive the first black mark. Time
heals many wrongs.
</P>
<P>
   McSorley being penalized for using an illegal stick more than
likely cost the Kings a Stanley Cup title in 1993, but he was still
such a popular figure in Los Angeles that former-owner Bruce
McNall, without informing then-general manager Nick Beverley,
brought McSorley back to the team by trading Tomas Sandstrom and
Shawn McEachern to Pittsburgh in Feb. 1994, less than five months
after he had been traded away. The deal that lives in Kings infamy
to this day.
</P>
<P>
   It will be much harder, perhaps impossible, to forget his
cowardly act on Feb. 21, 2000. Not only did it scar McSorley, it
brought the NHL exactly the kind of attention hockey doesn't need.
Just three nights before McSorley went head hunting, Paul Kariya
and Oleg Tverdovsky combined for a goal that was pure magic. But if
you weren't at the game or watching the telecast how many times
have you seen it?
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, McSorley's brutal act has been splashed over front
pages and sportscasts by newspapers and television stations that
normally all but ignore the NHL.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't have to end this way. McSorley, 37, could have gone
out the people's champion instead of a pale imitation of Mike
Tyson. Instead trying to chase down the young gun (Brashear),
McSorley could have left as an inspiration to those with limited
skill levels, but the willingness to work at improving.
</P>
<P>
   In Los Angeles, McSorley certainly was a man of the people.
Wayne Gretzky may have turned the town on to hockey, but it was
Marty McSorley and Luc Robitaille who captured their hearts.
Perhaps it was only fitting that McSorley assisted on Gretzky's
record-setting 802nd goal.
</P>
<P>
   With his long, blond hair and hard-hat work ethic, McSorley
appealed to both the casual and hardcore fan. Three times he was
named Los Angeles' most popular player in his first six years with
the Kings, Gretzky won the award twice.
</P>
<P>
   Never to busy to talk, he was a reporter's dream. He would stay
hours after practice filling up notepads with articulate responses
to any and all questions.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1992-93 season McSorley became almost larger than life.
Asked to play a bigger role by new coach Barry Melrose he scored a
career-high 15 goals and 41 points while accumulating a league-high
399 penalty minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Then in what should have been the defining moment of his 17-year
career he almost singlehandly changed the momentum in the
conference semifinals with his hit on Doug Gilmour late in a Game 1
loss. That set the stage for Gretzky and the Kings to upset the
Maple Leafs and head to Montreal for the Stanley Cup finals.
</P>
<P>
   Before the series began, Gretzky, proudly spoke of how much it
meant to see his protector turn into a legitimate NHL player, not
just a hired gun.
</P>
<P>
   McSorley had become such a valued member of the Kings, that none
dared to single him out for the illegal stick call just a few days
later. For years he had covered their backsides, now they were
covering his.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately for McSorley that's something nobody can, or
should, do now.
</P>
<P>
   --
</P>
<P>
   The McSorley incident has renewed the long-standing argument
that fighting should be banned in the NHL, as it is in Europe and
college hockey.
</P>
<P>
   Many feel such a policy would reduce the chances of something
like this happening again.
</P>
<P>
   But not everybody shares that opinion.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Kariya played NCAA hockey at the University of Maine, where
fighting isn't allowed and full masks are required.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of the most serious stick incidents I've seen were in
college,'' said Kariya. ``I don't think stick incidents would go
down, I think they would go up.''
</P>
<P>
   Ducks coach Craig Hartsburg was even more adament.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think fighting has anything to do with it (stick
fouls),'' he insisted. ``We've got people that don't watch our game
talking about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have a right to voice their opinion, but they don't have
a clue about our game.''

Boeing, Starbucks and Nordstrom, a mild climate _ it's the spoiled

from post-Vietnam stress disorder. McCain is a vital part of the
country's struggle to put the disorder behind it. &QL;

   Mexico's long-ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI)
knows all about the power of cinema. For 30 years until the 1960s,
the country's film industry, like the PRI itself, enjoyed a golden
age. It dominated Latin American screens, with stirring but
politically soothing tales of love, treachery and Mexican cowboys.
The memory of the medium's power still lingers, it seems. How else
to explain the PRI's clumsy attempt to censor ``Herod's Law,'' a
movie that casts a piercing gaze at that bygone period? &QL;

   For now, the biggest tug of wills over Kosovo's future is

northern fifth of Kosovo and ethnic Albanians to the south. How
firm that division becomes, and how many families survive on the
``wrong'' side of the line, will be a tough and telling test for
both the U.N. and NATO, which is rushing to boost the size of its
force from the current level of 30,000 to meet the challenge. &QL;

including the use of force'' if Taiwan were to refuse
``indefinitely'' to negotiate with the mainland on reunification.
The timing is not coincidental. On March 18, Taiwan is due to hold
an election to find a replacement for President Lee Teng-hui. &QL;

   ``This is the weirdest state I ever saw,'' says a Seattle man
who has lived in Washington state for 23 years after spending time
in Chicago, New York and California. ``Washington has cheap
electricity, no real social problems, companies like Microsoft,
Boeing, Starbucks and Nordstrom, a mild climate _ it's the spoiled
rich kid of the nation.'' Yes, but even for a rich kid life has
problems (ask George W. Bush). This is beginning to dawn on
Washington, and particularly on the state's largest city, Seattle.

   John McCain may be splitting the Republican Party asunder. But
when it comes to the rather more important question of the country
as a whole, he is more of a healer than a divider. Ever since

from post-Vietnam stress disorder. McCain is a vital part of the
country's struggle to put the disorder behind it. &QL;

knows all about the power of cinema. For 30 years until the 1960s,
the country's film industry, like the PRI itself, enjoyed a golden
age. It dominated Latin American screens, with stirring but
politically soothing tales of love, treachery and Mexican cowboys.
The memory of the medium's power still lingers, it seems. How else
to explain the PRI's clumsy attempt to censor ``Herod's Law,'' a
movie that casts a piercing gaze at that bygone period? &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   This week the Republican Party took one great step forward and
one huge step back in its quest to recapture the White House.
</P>
<P>
   The step forward was to capture the imagination of the American
electorate. Voters of all parties are flocking to the Republican
primaries.
</P>
<P>
   In South Carolina, Senator John McCain had been expected to pick
up momentum from his win in New Hampshire. Instead he was trounced
by George W. Bush. Three days later, Michigan seemed certain to
dispatch McCain; yet he won by seven percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican race, now heading towards a showdown in New York
and California on March 7, is the most exciting since Gerald Ford
and Ronald Reagan battled it out in 1976.
</P>
<P>
   But there is also that backwards step to consider. To win in
South Carolina, Bush ``turned negative'' with a ferocity that few
expected. McCain's response has been only a little more
gentlemanly.
</P>
<P>
   Worse, the squabbling party seems to be splitting in a way that
could spell disaster in the general election in November.
</P>
<P>
   With McCain picking up the votes of independents, Bush has been
dragged to the right. Conservative posturing, such as making a
speech at a South Carolinian university that forbids interracial
dating, may help the Texan win the nomination, because the next
primaries are nearly all ones in which only registered Republicans
can vote.
</P>
<P>
   But such shenanigans could put off the independent voters that
the nominee will desperately need in November. This helps explain
why, even as the Republican race grips the attention, much of the
(supposedly) smart money in Washington is shifting towards Al Gore,
the likely Democratic candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, there is even the suspicion that minority politics might
actually suit some hard-core Republicans in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Held hostage by special interests and the religious right,
outmaneuvered by President Bill Clinton at every turn, their only
remaining clarion-call has been to propose cutting taxes far more
than the electorate wants. Such tactics lead towards a political
ghetto.
</P>
<P>
   From now on, Bush and McCain must seek to avoid that fate.
McCain's chance of doing so looks the better one. His candidacy
should anyway have two big attractions for all but the most
narrow-minded members of his own party.
</P>
<P>
   First, he is a true-blue conservative. How an anti-abortion,
pro-deregulation, pro-gun war hero could ever be deemed
unacceptably liberal remains a mystery.
</P>
<P>
   Second, he stands for moral leadership which, combined with his
passion for campaign-finance reform, could skewer the
ethically-challenged Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, one sad fact of the Republican Party's recent history
is that it often takes an outsider to reform it _ and make it
electable. Ronald Reagan and Dwight Eisenhower were such creatures;
McCain could be another.
</P>
<P>
   Bush is still the party's front-runner, and still stands a fair
chance in November. Yet he risks finding himself trapped by the
relentlessly rightward path he has adopted.
</P>
<P>
   Independents make up 15 percent of the electorate; every
conservative fusillade from Bush's lackeys against McCain sends the
independents shuttling towards Gore.
</P>
<P>
   He could, nevertheless, redefine himself once again. After all,
the Bush family has a habit of running dirtily but governing
cleanly (President Bush, now revered as a statesman, used the
infamous Willie Horton advertisement against Michael Dukakis).
</P>
<P>
   And, if nothing else, Bush, who in New Hampshire gave the
impression that electioneering bored him, has shown that he really
wants the job. Indeed, in his desperate transformation, he has
mimicked that other dynastic scion, Gore.
</P>
<P>
   The vice-president's campaign against Bill Bradley has also been
mucky and disingenuous. And Gore has been dragged to the left on
issues such as trade and gays in the armed services.
</P>
<P>
   Come November, Gore could also be painted as an extremist _
provided, of course, that Bush can inch a bit closer to the center.
That is not impossible.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's political credo has been somewhat traduced by the
campaign. By most standards, his record is reassuringly moderate.
On issues such as trade and immigration, he has stood out against
the nastier isolationist tendency in his party.
</P>
<P>
   It is hard to imagine that a man who speaks fluent Spanish and
has a Latina sister-in-law really stands for white racist values,
as he has sometimes seemed to suggest.
</P>
<P>
   In Texas, his achievements in education are real enough. And he
can point to a decent record of constructive cooperation with
Democrats. Remember, it was this moderate, inclusionist, optimistic
George W. Bush who once led Gore in the polls by 19 percentage
points.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Republicans' choice should have little to do with
being fair to either candidate. The point of this exercise is to
choose the man most likely to beat Gore in November.
</P>
<P>
   On that measure, the choice should surely be John McCain. Of the
two, he has demonstrated the clearest ability to appeal to
independent and Democratic voters, which will be crucial in turning
a party victory into a presidential one.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, he is most clearly the man for the post-Clinton
moment, the anti-Gore: clean, heroic, straight-talking, likely to
stand up strongly for democracy's interests around the globe.
</P>
<P>
   The Economist disapproves of his positions on guns and abortion,
and of his anti-tobacco stance. But if we had a vote, then on the
evidence so far it would go to Senator McCain. &QL;

as he has sometimes seemed to suggest.
</P>
<P>
   In Texas, his achievements in education are real enough. And he
can point to a decent record of constructive cooperation with
Democrats. Remember, it was this moderate, inclusionist, optimistic
George W. Bush who once led Gore in the polls by 19 percentage
points.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Republicans' choice should have little to do with
being fair to either candidate. The point of this exercise is to
choose the man most likely to beat Gore in November.
</P>
<P>
   On that measure, the choice should surely be John McCain. Of the
two, he has demonstrated the clearest ability to appeal to
independent and Democratic voters, which will be crucial in turning
a party victory into a presidential one.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, he is most clearly the man for the post-Clinton
moment, the anti-Gore: clean, heroic, straight-talking, likely to
stand up strongly for democracy's interests around the globe.
</P>
<P>
   The Economist disapproves of his positions on guns and abortion,
and of his anti-tobacco stance. But if we had a vote, then on the
evidence so far it would go to Senator McCain. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   This week the Republican Party took one great step forward and
one huge step back in its quest to recapture the White House.
</P>
<P>
   The step forward was to capture the imagination of the American
electorate. Voters of all parties are flocking to the Republican
primaries.
</P>
<P>
   In South Carolina, Senator John McCain had been expected to pick
up momentum from his win in New Hampshire. Instead he was trounced
by George W. Bush. Three days later, Michigan seemed certain to
dispatch McCain; yet he won by seven percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican race, now heading towards a showdown in New York
and California on March 7, is the most exciting since Gerald Ford
and Ronald Reagan battled it out in 1976.
</P>
<P>
   But there is also that backwards step to consider. To win in
South Carolina, Bush ``turned negative'' with a ferocity that few
expected. McCain's response has been only a little more
gentlemanly.
</P>
<P>
   Worse, the squabbling party seems to be splitting in a way that
could spell disaster in the general election in November.
</P>
<P>
   With McCain picking up the votes of independents, Bush has been
dragged to the right. Conservative posturing, such as making a
speech at a South Carolinian university that forbids interracial
dating, may help the Texan win the nomination, because the next
primaries are nearly all ones in which only registered Republicans
can vote.
</P>
<P>
   But such shenanigans could put off the independent voters that
the nominee will desperately need in November. This helps explain
why, even as the Republican race grips the attention, much of the
(supposedly) smart money in Washington is shifting towards Al Gore,
the likely Democratic candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, there is even the suspicion that minority politics might
actually suit some hard-core Republicans in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Held hostage by special interests and the religious right,
outmaneuvered by President Bill Clinton at every turn, their only
remaining clarion-call has been to propose cutting taxes far more
than the electorate wants. Such tactics lead towards a political
ghetto.
</P>
<P>
   From now on, Bush and McCain must seek to avoid that fate.
McCain's chance of doing so looks the better one. His candidacy
should anyway have two big attractions for all but the most
narrow-minded members of his own party.
</P>
<P>
   First, he is a true-blue conservative. How an anti-abortion,
pro-deregulation, pro-gun war hero could ever be deemed
unacceptably liberal remains a mystery.
</P>
<P>
   Second, he stands for moral leadership which, combined with his
passion for campaign-finance reform, could skewer the
ethically-challenged Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, one sad fact of the Republican Party's recent history
is that it often takes an outsider to reform it _ and make it
electable. Ronald Reagan and Dwight Eisenhower were such creatures;
McCain could be another.
</P>
<P>
   Bush is still the party's front-runner, and still stands a fair
chance in November. Yet he risks finding himself trapped by the
relentlessly rightward path he has adopted.
</P>
<P>
   Independents make up 15 percent of the electorate; every
conservative fusillade from Bush's lackeys against McCain sends the
independents shuttling towards Gore.
</P>
<P>
   He could, nevertheless, redefine himself once again. After all,
the Bush family has a habit of running dirtily but governing
cleanly (President Bush, now revered as a statesman, used the
infamous Willie Horton advertisement against Michael Dukakis).
</P>
<P>
   And, if nothing else, Bush, who in New Hampshire gave the
impression that electioneering bored him, has shown that he really
wants the job. Indeed, in his desperate transformation, he has
mimicked that other dynastic scion, Gore.
</P>
<P>
   The vice-president's campaign against Bill Bradley has also been
mucky and disingenuous. And Gore has been dragged to the left on
issues such as trade and gays in the armed services.
</P>
<P>
   Come November, Gore could also be painted as an extremist _
provided, of course, that Bush can inch a bit closer to the center.
That is not impossible.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's political credo has been somewhat traduced by the
campaign. By most standards, his record is reassuringly moderate.
On issues such as trade and immigration, he has stood out against
the nastier isolationist tendency in his party.
</P>
<P>
   It is hard to imagine that a man who speaks fluent Spanish and
has a Latina sister-in-law really stands for white racist values,
as he has sometimes seemed to suggest.
</P>
<P>
   In Texas, his achievements in education are real enough. And he
can point to a decent record of constructive cooperation with
Democrats. Remember, it was this moderate, inclusionist, optimistic
George W. Bush who once led Gore in the polls by 19 percentage

<P>
   ``An event of historic proportions,'' was the Clinton
administration's judgment on the reformists' victory in Iran's
parliamentary election last Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Can the United States now build on this historic, but still
fragile, event by improving its own bad relations with the Islamic
republic? It would be the waste of a chance if it failed to do so.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past couple of years, the Americans have made tentative
efforts to start a political dialogue with the Iranian government.
These have been spurned.
</P>
<P>
   President Muhammad Khatami has welcomed people-to-people talk,
but has not felt strong enough, in the face of the hostility of his
implacably Great-Satan-hating adversaries, to extend this welcome
to official negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   Now Khatami and his supporters are on a roll, able to override
crude sniping. A resumption of relations would please most
Iranians.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the reformers' attitude towards the United States
remains defiant. The door is open, they say, but it is up to
America to walk through it, carrying gifts.
</P>
<P>
   Although the years in which the United States tried to
``contain'' Iran are long gone, American laws or rules prohibit
virtually all commercial transactions between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
   However, since the ban on investment in, and trade with, Iran
dates from a 1995 executive order, Clinton can, if he so decides,
modify it without congressional approval.
</P>
<P>
   American oilmen, frustrated as their competitors grab contracts
with Iran, are hungry for an easing of the regulations. For their
part, the Iranians would be happy if they were allowed to export,
say, their carpets or caviar to America.
</P>
<P>
   Even more important to Iran would be a U-turn in America's
determination to block it from any Caspian pipeline deal: Iran
aspires, not unreasonably, to be one of the principal corridors
bringing Caspian oil and gas to market.
</P>
<P>
   Iran is also insistent that America should show some give on
what it calls its ``frozen assets.'' The shah ordered, and paid
for, American military goods and services which, after the 1979
revolution, were not delivered. The dispute is before the
American-Iranian claims tribunal in The Hague, an arbitration body
set up in the early 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Although some of the claims have been settled, Iran is still
trying to claim amounts that go into billions of dollars. It would
be good to tie up all this business, maybe with a unilateral
American offer of a lump sum, even if that involved congressional
approval.
</P>
<P>
   If America were to tempt Iran to negotiation with juicy tidbits,
what should Iran offer in return?
</P>
<P>
   Some years ago, Iran stopped slinging money around the world to
terrorist groups. It still supports Lebanon's Hezbollah guerrillas
and will continue to do so as long as Israel occupies south
Lebanon. But it could commit itself to stop, once Israel has left
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   Iran could also commit itself to supporting Yasser Arafat in the
Palestinian-Israeli peace process, thus taking the vitriol, and
much of the danger, out of its traditional anti-Israeli stance.
</P>
<P>
   All this is important. But a main reason behind America's
sanctions is to deny Iran the money that it might otherwise spend
on weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
   Iran, once the victim of Iraqi aggression, lives in a rough
neighborhood, surrounded by people who not only have ballistic
missiles but also nuclear capacity (Russia, India, Pakistan,
American forces in the Gulf).
</P>
<P>
   It has signed the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, but remains
suspect. It is bound to look to its own security. But it would
lessen suspicion if it subscribed to the newly tightened nuclear
safeguards _ which would cost it nothing if, as it claims, it has
no military nuclear ambitions.
</P>
<P>
   Iran is on the cusp of reformation. There are still powerful
forces bent on keeping it in the darkness of petty rules and a
harsh clerical judiciary.
</P>
<P>
   Its reforming leaders, rejecting any hint of patronage, still
feel they have to move with great caution in their dealings with
the United States. But the election gives America an unusual
opportunity to help the reformists and further its own strategic
interests. It should seize it. &QL;

<P>
   Is it a fleeting fancy, or a life-changing love? The question
lingers over today's obsession with the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   On one side, electronic commerce is exploding, and the stock
markets' dot.com mania seems to be migrating from America to Europe
and Japan, and even to emerging economies.
</P>
<P>
   On the other side, delivery snarl-ups have besmirched the
reputation of electronic retailers, and profits from doing business
on the World Wide Web are largely nonexistent.
</P>
<P>
   What is one to conclude? Let's sift through the sense and
nonsense surrounding the business-to-consumer e-boom.
</P>
<P>
   There is much hype, but there is also a solid base in reality.
And this suggests that the second answer to the lingering question
is closer to the mark.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet is profoundly affecting almost all business and
commerce. A common slogan is true: any big firm that fails to
grapple with the consequences is putting its future at risk.
</P>
<P>
   Numbers tell only part of the story. In 1999 global e-commerce
was worth a little over $150 billion. Around 80 percent of those
transactions were between one business and another.
</P>
<P>
   Yet growth of all forms of e-commerce is hectic.
Business-to-business Web exchanges are mushrooming. In America
e-retailing revenues tripled last year; in Europe and Japan they
rose faster still.
</P>
<P>
   The absolute level of consumer e-commerce is still small, at
around 1 percent of American retail sales. But in some areas its
share is far higher: 15 percent of retail stockbroking and 5
percent of book sales, for instance.
</P>
<P>
   The influence of the Internet stretches farther than such
figures suggest. It is used more as a source of information than as
a place to buy.
</P>
<P>
   Surveys in America suggest that last year, when less than 3
percent of new car sales were made over the Web, 40 percent
involved it at some stage, usually for price comparisons.
</P>
<P>
   And e-commerce often needs to take only a small share of the pie
to have a big impact on what is left. Travel agents' margins are so
flimsy that a loss of 3 percent of their market to the Web would be
enough to push many out of business.
</P>
<P>
   One impact is thus to intensify competition, producing benefits
to consumers in lower prices and more choice, at the expense of
producers and intermediaries. But a more profound effect is a
wholesale restructuring of businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to the rise of e-commerce, such giant firms as General
Motors, Ford and, this week, Unilever, are embracing the Internet
for many of their activities. And the giants' move means that their
suppliers, as well as intermediaries through whom they sell, must
take to the Internet too.
</P>
<P>
   The promised land that this ripple effect holds out is one of
more transparency, greater efficiency and, yes, higher
productivity.
</P>
<P>
   Hard macroeconomic evidence of these things is admittedly still
elusive. But it is at least conceivable that new technology and the
Internet may be partly responsible for America's unexpectedly
strong recent productivity growth, as well as its surprisingly low
inflation.
</P>
<P>
   So is the Internet leading to economic nirvana _ and does
dot.com mania make sense? Not quite.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet may be transforming business; but it is not
rewriting economics to enable the American economy to expand at its
current rate without dangerously overheating. Nor does the
explosion of e-commerce justify the current high prices of many
Internet-related shares.
</P>
<P>
   On the contrary, all the signs are that the markets remain in
the grip of a technology-related bubble. Many equity markets
currently look overvalued.
</P>
<P>
   But Internet shares are causing particular concern, for two
reasons. One is simply that their overvaluation looks so huge.
</P>
<P>
   Because few make profits, normal earnings-related measures
cannot be used. But even enthusiasts concede that as many as 80
percent of today's Internet companies may not survive _ just as
almost all the early railroads, carmakers and airlines did not.
</P>
<P>
   Behind the hype, investors are reflecting this. Shares in
profitable technology providers such as Cisco, Oracle or Sun
Microsystems are doing well. But nearly three-quarters of
Internet-related initial public offerings in America since mid-1995
now trade below their issue prices.
</P>
<P>
   And over the past year the shares of several big American
e-commerce firms have crashed: eToys (down 80 percent from its
peak), Priceline (down 69 percent) and E*Trade (down 66 percent),
for example.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet bubble in Europe and Asia seems sure to be followed
by similar collapses.
</P>
<P>
   The second concern is one voiced by managers of traditional
(non-tech) firms. Their share prices, they say, have been savaged
just because investors are, irrationally, redirecting their capital
into glamorous technology and Internet firms.
</P>
<P>
   Some say they are being punished despite healthy results;
several talk of a misallocation of capital from profitable to
loss-making activities. Yet many of these gripes are misplaced.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet bubble is clearly distorting the market, and its
bursting may well cause pain across the whole economy. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (100-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE AT 825) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, whenever firms can raise capital virtually free, they
are likely to waste much of it, as so many dot.coms are now doing
with their marketing expenditure. But there is little evidence that
traditional firms' shares are undervalued, or that they are finding
it hard to raise capital.
</P>
<P>
   And the capital going into Internet firms is not all being
wasted _ even if today's shareholders may not reap the benefits.
This is especially true of makers of computers and the Internet's
infrastructure.
</P>
<P>

at their peril.
</P>

business is not enough: the whole business needs to be redesigned
around the cost-saving, communication-easing properties of the Net.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Is it a fleeting fancy, or a life-changing love? The question
lingers over today's obsession with the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   On one side, electronic commerce is exploding, and the stock
markets' dot.com mania seems to be migrating from America to Europe
and Japan, and even to emerging economies.
</P>
<P>
   On the other side, delivery snarl-ups have besmirched the
reputation of electronic retailers, and profits from doing business
on the World Wide Web are largely nonexistent.
</P>
<P>
   What is one to conclude? Let's sift through the sense and
nonsense surrounding the business-to-consumer e-boom.
</P>
<P>
   There is much hype, but there is also a solid base in reality.
And this suggests that the second answer to the lingering question
is closer to the mark.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet is profoundly affecting almost all business and
commerce. A common slogan is true: any big firm that fails to
grapple with the consequences is putting its future at risk.
</P>
<P>
   Numbers tell only part of the story. In 1999 global e-commerce
was worth a little over $150 billion. Around 80 percent of those
transactions were between one business and another.
</P>
<P>
   Yet growth of all forms of e-commerce is hectic.
Business-to-business Web exchanges are mushrooming. In America
e-retailing revenues tripled last year; in Europe and Japan they
rose faster still.
</P>
<P>
   The absolute level of consumer e-commerce is still small, at
around 1 percent of American retail sales. But in some areas its
share is far higher: 15 percent of retail stockbroking and 5
percent of book sales, for instance.
</P>
<P>
   The influence of the Internet stretches farther than such
figures suggest. It is used more as a source of information than as
a place to buy.
</P>
<P>
   Surveys in America suggest that last year, when less than 3
percent of new car sales were made over the Web, 40 percent
involved it at some stage, usually for price comparisons.
</P>
<P>
   And e-commerce often needs to take only a small share of the pie
to have a big impact on what is left. Travel agents' margins are so
flimsy that a loss of 3 percent of their market to the Web would be
enough to push many out of business.
</P>
<P>
   One impact is thus to intensify competition, producing benefits
to consumers in lower prices and more choice, at the expense of
producers and intermediaries. But a more profound effect is a
wholesale restructuring of businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to the rise of e-commerce, such giant firms as General
Motors, Ford and, this week, Unilever, are embracing the Internet

</P>
<P>
   During a town-hall meeting in South Carolina, George W. Bush was
asked what he would do about a woman's medical insurance which
doesn't cover her son's chronic illness. Bush's analysis: ``I'm
sorry. I wish I could wave a wand.'' (Salon.com, Feb. 18) &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; FACTOID OF THE WEEK: &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Some 23 million Americans watched the Fox television show ``Who
Wants To Marry A Multimillionaire?'' on Tuesday night. At the same
time, 3 million people watched the Republican presidential debate. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; HUNK OF THE WEEK: &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore, who was challenged to take part in the ``stakeout
workout.'' The ``workout,'' practiced by bored cameramen, consists
of weightlifting with a 30-lb. camera. Gore impressed watchers with
nine curls with his right arm, six with his left. He also swung the
$75,000 camera over his head several times. (Los Angeles Times,
Feb. 20) &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BACKHANDED COMPLIMENTS OF THE WEEK: &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Former New York Senator Al D'Amato on John McCain: ``He is the
Don Quixote of modern-day politics.''
</P>
<P>
   Representative Sam Johnson of Texas on Bush: ``He was a pilot in
the Texas National Guard. So it's not like he doesn't know the
military.''

<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by the New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   SEATTLE _ ``This is the weirdest state I ever saw,'' says a
Seattle man who has lived in Washington state for 23 years after
spending time in Chicago, New York and California.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has never had a problem. Washington has cheap electricity,
no real social problems, companies like Microsoft, Boeing,
Starbucks and Nordstrom, a mild climate _ it's the spoiled rich kid
of the nation.''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, but even for a rich kid life has problems (ask George W.
Bush). This is beginning to dawn on Washington, and not least on
the state's largest city, Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the trouble is, on the face of it, just bad luck.
Seattle was host to the recent mugging of the World Trade
Organization (WTO).
</P>
<P>
   Then an Algerian was arrested in Port Angeles, on the state's
border with Canada, allegedly with a carload of explosive materials
bound for Seattle; so the city's millennium-eve party got
cancelled.
</P>
<P>
   There were a lot of people from Seattle among the 88 killed when
Alaska Airlines Flight 261 crashed on Jan. 31.
</P>
<P>
   And now the most celebrated sportsman in the city's history, Ken
Griffey, Jr., center-fielder for the Seattle Mariners baseball
team, has decamped to Cincinnati, Ohio, a vulgar place of steamy
summer heat and barbecued pork.
</P>
<P>
   But there are also disquieting clouds on the economic horizon. A
decade of prosperity unmatched almost anywhere in the country may
be losing some of its brightness.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing, which employed 104,000 people around Seattle in 1998, is
now down to under 80,000, and the number will fall further as
Airbus Industrie's challenge to Boeing obliges it to cut
production.
</P>
<P>
   Outside Seattle the forest-products industry is a shadow of its
pre-spotted-owl self, and the normally lucrative agricultural
sector based on wheat and apples has suffered badly from Asia's
economic downturn.
</P>
<P>
   The state total of unemployment claims is bigger than it was a
year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Most tellingly, moving companies say that more people are now
leaving Washington state than are moving into it. This is a
remarkable turnabout.
</P>
<P>
   Immigration has exceeded emigration for nearly 25 years, and as
recently as 1997 newcomers outnumbered departures by two to one.
</P>
<P>
   Reasons for leaving mentioned to your correspondent include:
better job opportunities elsewhere (California, Oregon, Utah, North
Carolina); cheaper housing (darned near anywhere except San
Francisco and Manhattan); less rain (absolutely anywhere in the
United States). &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM _ 125 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 400) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If yesterday's newcomers had known more about the state's
history they might have been less surprised by some recent events.
</P>
<P>
   Take the WTO fiasco. Long before the Seattle area was home to
Microsoft and Amazon.com, it was the stamping ground of the most
militant trade unions on the West Coast. That streak of radicalism
still exists, and no doubt provided some of the demonstrators at
the anti-WTO riots.
</P>
<P>
   It was ``utterly unrealistic,'' says Walt Crowley, a local
historian, to think that Seattle's anti-globalizationists would
turn up at the WTO meeting and just ``quietly register their
objections.''
</P>
<P>
   The area's leftist past may also help to explain a growing
resentment about the huge income disparities of the Seattle
region. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In King County, which encompasses Seattle and cities such as
Redmond (where Microsoft is based), 23,500 cosseted software
workers earn an average of $287,700 a year apiece, including share
options. The median household income of everyone else in the county
is $34,300.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, despite the wide reach of the new prosperity,
that can be a real cause of indignation.
</P>
<P>
   The uneasy coexistence of new wealth and old tightwad populism
produces some curious contrasts. A $500 million new baseball
stadium completed last summer, and financed in large part out of
taxes, is the most expensive sports center in the nation.
(Unfortunately Griffey disliked it, and set off for Ohio.)
</P>
<P>
   But then, in November, voters overwhelmingly approved a measure
that cut the state's vehicle-license tax _ formerly about $400 a
year for a car valued at $20,000, though less for cheaper ones _ to
a flat $30 per vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   That shot a torpedo through the budgets for new roads and a
better ferry system, and is going to make the Seattle area's
traffic jams, already the country's third-worst, even more
maddening. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (SECOND OPTIONAL TRIM _ 50 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 725) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The irritation is not diminished by the fact that the city
council recently spent two weeks debating whether circus elephants
should be allowed into the city (they are badly treated, said the
opponents). Result: elephants in, by a five-to-four vote. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF SECOND TRIM. STORY CONTINUES TO 1,000) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The next few years could be interesting. Michael Parks, the
editor of a Seattle business newsletter, worries that Airbus, whose
order book was greater than Boeing's last year, might seize the
leadership of the aerospace industry.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing seems distracted by its recent merger binge and a
surprising strike by usually tractable white-collar engineers.
</P>
<P>
   Other fears are that the Asian economic recovery will prove less
muscular than hoped (the port of Seattle is a major export route to
Asia) and that the Department of Justice may carry out its veiled
threats to break up Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle could even find itself left behind in the dot.com
revolution, since local companies such as Amazon.com,
HomeGrocer.com and Drugstore.com have staked their all on the
consumer market just when the business-to-business dot.com market
looks like an even bigger profit-maker.
</P>
<P>
   Still, quite a bit of sunshine manages to push its way through
the recent clouds.
</P>
<P>
   Unemployment in the state remains a modest 3 percent.
Construction crews are swarming over new high-rise buildings in
Seattle and big suburban areas such as Bellevue.
</P>
<P>
   And the high-tech money that has bathed the region in its glow
has led to a Medici-like investment in the arts, philanthropic
endowments that make Andrew Carnegie seem a miser, a spate of
cracking good restaurants, and a bull market for BMW dealerships.
</P>
<P>
   Weird? Spoiled? Does anyone here really care? &QL;

   SEATTLE _ ``This is the weirdest state I ever saw,'' says a
Seattle man who has lived in Washington state for 23 years after
spending time in Chicago, New York and California.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has never had a problem. Washington has cheap electricity,
no real social problems, companies like Microsoft, Boeing,
Starbucks and Nordstrom, a mild climate _ it's the spoiled rich kid
of the nation.''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, but even for a rich kid life has problems (ask George W.
Bush). This is beginning to dawn on Washington, and not least on
the state's largest city, Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the trouble is, on the face of it, just bad luck.
Seattle was host to the recent mugging of the World Trade
Organization (WTO).
</P>
<P>
   Then an Algerian was arrested in Port Angeles, on the state's
border with Canada, allegedly with a carload of explosive materials
bound for Seattle; so the city's millennium-eve party got
cancelled.
</P>
<P>
   There were a lot of people from Seattle among the 88 killed when
Alaska Airlines Flight 261 crashed on Jan. 31.
</P>
<P>
   And now the most celebrated sportsman in the city's history, Ken
Griffey, Jr., center-fielder for the Seattle Mariners baseball
team, has decamped to Cincinnati, Ohio, a vulgar place of steamy
summer heat and barbecued pork.
</P>
<P>
   But there are also disquieting clouds on the economic horizon. A
decade of prosperity unmatched almost anywhere in the country may
be losing some of its brightness.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing, which employed 104,000 people around Seattle in 1998, is
now down to under 80,000, and the number will fall further as
Airbus Industrie's challenge to Boeing obliges it to cut
production.
</P>
<P>
   Outside Seattle the forest-products industry is a shadow of its
pre-spotted-owl self, and the normally lucrative agricultural
sector based on wheat and apples has suffered badly from Asia's
economic downturn.
</P>
<P>
   The state total of unemployment claims is bigger than it was a
year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Most tellingly, moving companies say that more people are now
leaving Washington state than are moving into it. This is a
remarkable turnabout.
</P>
<P>
   Immigration has exceeded emigration for nearly 25 years, and as
recently as 1997 newcomers outnumbered departures by two to one.
</P>
<P>
   Reasons for leaving mentioned to your correspondent include:
better job opportunities elsewhere (California, Oregon, Utah, North
Carolina); cheaper housing (darned near anywhere except San
Francisco and Manhattan); less rain (absolutely anywhere in the
United States). &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;

 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If yesterday's newcomers had known more about the state's
history they might have been less surprised by some recent events.
</P>
<P>
   Take the WTO fiasco. Long before the Seattle area was home to
Microsoft and Amazon.com, it was the stamping ground of the most
militant trade unions on the West Coast. That streak of radicalism
still exists, and no doubt provided some of the demonstrators at
the anti-WTO riots.
</P>
<P>
   It was ``utterly unrealistic,'' says Walt Crowley, a local
historian, to think that Seattle's anti-globalizationists would
turn up at the WTO meeting and just ``quietly register their
objections.''
</P>
<P>
   The area's leftist past may also help to explain a growing
resentment about the huge income disparities of the Seattle
region. &QL;

</P>

</P>
<P>
   In King County, which encompasses Seattle and cities such as
Redmond (where Microsoft is based), 23,500 cosseted software
workers earn an average of $287,700 a year apiece, including share
options. The median household income of everyone else in the county
is $34,300.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, despite the wide reach of the new prosperity,
that can be a real cause of indignation.
</P>
<P>
   The uneasy coexistence of new wealth and old tightwad populism
produces some curious contrasts. A $500 million new baseball
stadium completed last summer, and financed in large part out of
taxes, is the most expensive sports center in the nation.
(Unfortunately Griffey disliked it, and set off for Ohio.)
</P>
<P>
   But then, in November, voters overwhelmingly approved a measure
that cut the state's vehicle-license tax _ formerly about $400 a
year for a car valued at $20,000, though less for cheaper ones _ to
a flat $30 per vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   That shot a torpedo through the budgets for new roads and a
better ferry system, and is going to make the Seattle area's
traffic jams, already the country's third-worst, even more
maddening. &QL;

   &UR; (SECOND OPTIONAL TRIM _ 50 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 725) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The irritation is not diminished by the fact that the city
council recently spent two weeks debating whether circus elephants
should be allowed into the city (they are badly treated, said the
opponents). Result: elephants in, by a five-to-four vote. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF SECOND TRIM. STORY CONTINUES TO 1,000) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The next few years could be interesting. Michael Parks, the
editor of a Seattle business newsletter, worries that Airbus, whose
order book was greater than Boeing's last year, might seize the
leadership of the aerospace industry.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing seems distracted by its recent merger binge and a
surprising strike by usually tractable white-collar engineers.
</P>
<P>
   Other fears are that the Asian economic recovery will prove less
muscular than hoped (the port of Seattle is a major export route to
Asia) and that the Department of Justice may carry out its veiled
threats to break up Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle could even find itself left behind in the dot.com
revolution, since local companies such as Amazon.com,
HomeGrocer.com and Drugstore.com have staked their all on the
consumer market just when the business-to-business dot.com market
looks like an even bigger profit-maker.
</P>
<P>
   Still, quite a bit of sunshine manages to push its way through
the recent clouds.
</P>
<P>
   Unemployment in the state remains a modest 3 percent.
Construction crews are swarming over new high-rise buildings in
Seattle and big suburban areas such as Bellevue.
</P>
<P>
   And the high-tech money that has bathed the region in its glow
has led to a Medici-like investment in the arts, philanthropic
endowments that make Andrew Carnegie seem a miser, a spate of
cracking good restaurants, and a bull market for BMW dealerships.
</P>
<P>
   Weird? Spoiled? Does anyone here really care? &QL;

   John McCain may be splitting the Republican Party asunder. But
when it comes to the rather more important question of the country
as a whole, he is more of a healer than a divider.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since Saigon fell to the Communists in 1975, the United
States has been suffering from post-Vietnam stress disorder. McCain
is a vital part of the country's struggle to put the disorder
behind it.
</P>
<P>
   The Vietnam War divided the United States more bitterly than any
war other than the Civil War. It maimed two presidencies. It
undermined the country's faith in its great institutions, as the
left railed against the people who got the country into the war and
the right railed, equally angrily, against those who made such a
hash of getting it out.
</P>
<P>
   It turned people not just against the ancient ideal of military
service but against the ideal of public service in general.
</P>
<P>
   If America's current malaise can be described as private
affluence and public anomie, then Vietnam bears much of the blame.
</P>
<P>
   In previous presidential campaigns the war has been the secret
that dared not speak its name. Bill Clinton could hardly feel
America's pain on the subject when he spent the war not inhaling in
Oxford.
</P>
<P>
   But many leading Republicans found it hard to accuse him of
being a draft-dodger when they too pulled strings to make sure that
they and their kind avoided service. Both Dan Quayle and George W.
Bush spent the war defending their native states against invasion
from their next-door neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, however, is putting the war at the heart of his
campaign. His acolytes do not turn up to his rallies carrying
portentous policy documents, as Bill Clinton's acolytes turned up
in 1992 with copies of ``Putting People First.''
</P>
<P>
   They turn up clutching copies of McCain's memoirs, ``Faith of My
Fathers,'' holding it aloft while he is speaking, often with tears
rolling down their faces.
</P>
<P>
   The book is all about how McCain found himself by going to serve
in Vietnam, and a constant refrain of his speeches is that his
fellow countrymen can find themselves, too, if they will only
rediscover the virtues of public service. &QL;

</P>
<P>
   The change in the mood about military service began with an
outpouring of emotion about the Second World War. Steven
Spielberg's film, ``Saving Private Ryan,'' succeeded in mixing
bloody battle scenes with an uplifting story about an attempt to
save a mother from seeing her fourth son suffer the same fate as
his brothers, and die in the war.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Brokaw's ``The Greatest Generation,'' a book about the men
and women who came of age in time for that war, has been on the New
York Times best-seller list for over a year.
</P>
<P>
   McCain provides the perfect link between the greatest generation
and the Vietnam generation. The white-haired senator looks as if he
could well have suffered at the hands of the Nazis rather than the
Communists.
</P>
<P>
   And his book is as much about his grandfather and father _ both
of them four-star admirals who saw distinguished service in the
Second World War _ as it is about himself. &QL;

   The impact of ``Faith of My Fathers'' is stunning. It makes
Vietnam less of an isolated disaster, more a part of a grand
tradition of military service.
</P>
<P>
   The task of rehabilitation is made all the easier by the fact
that McCain spent most of the war being tortured by psychopaths,
not mowing down innocent villagers. &QL;

   On Oct. 26, 1967, he had to eject himself from his aircraft in
the sky above North Vietnam, breaking his left arm, his right arm
in three places and his right knee. A crowd of Vietnamese then
broke his shoulder with a rifle butt and bayoneted him in the
groin.
</P>
<P>
   The guards at the Hoa Lo Prison _ the infamous Hanoi Hilton _ at
first refused to give him medical treatment unless he revealed
military secrets and confessed to being a war criminal.
</P>
<P>
   Then, on discovering that his father was commander-in-chief of
the Pacific fleet, they tried to turn him into a propaganda tool.
They wanted him to denounce America in return for medical
assistance. They also offered to release him, only to have the
offer rejected.
</P>
<P>
   When he was at last released, after five-and-a-half years in
captivity, he weighed less than 98 pounds and was unable to comb
his own hair, because his broken bones had healed so badly. &QL;

<P>
   McCain's record in the war explains his appeal to two unexpected
groups of people. The first are the working-class Democrats who
came out to vote for him in such impressive numbers in Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   These are the people whose fathers went off to fight in Vietnam
while their richer countrymen stayed at home burning flags and
getting degrees. And they are also the people who seethed with rage
when Jane Fonda shrilled for the Vietcong and Hollywood movies
turned Vietnam vets into drug-hazed zombies.
</P>
<P>
   The second group, the normally liberal chattering classes, is
rather more confused about its enthusiasm for McCain.
</P>
<P>
   Journalists are supposed to like him because he offers them free
doughnuts and unparalleled access. But the bright people's
enthusiasm for McCain runs much deeper than this, and extends to
those who have never set foot on his ``Straight Talk Express.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain speaks to the professional classes' guilt about not
serving in Vietnam just as clearly as he speaks to the Reagan
Democrats' anger about serving and being betrayed.
</P>
<P>
   In 1983 Christopher Buckley wrote a famous article lamenting the
fact that he and most of his peers had managed to get out of
serving in Vietnam. Much of the article was taken up with
remembering that he and his friends suffered not a jot of
deprivation at home while their less privileged countrymen were
dying in Southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
   But part of it was a meditation about what they had lost by not
going. ``We forfeited what might have been the ultimate
opportunity, in increasingly self-obsessed times, of making the
ultimate commitment to something greater than ourselves: the
survival of comrades.''
</P>
<P>
   The betting is still, though more warily, that the Republican
machine will propel Bush to the nomination this summer. But even if
McCain fails to capture his party's nomination, he may succeed in
doing something even more important.
</P>
<P>
   The notion of public service has been comprehensively trashed in
the wake of Vietnam, by the government-hating right as much as by
the establishment-bating left.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to McCain, it might just possibly be on its way to
becoming fashionable again. &QL;

<P>

<P>
   John McCain may be splitting the Republican Party asunder. But
when it comes to the rather more important question of the country
as a whole, he is more of a healer than a divider.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since Saigon fell to the Communists in 1975, the United
States has been suffering from post-Vietnam stress disorder. McCain
is a vital part of the country's struggle to put the disorder
behind it.
</P>
<P>
   The Vietnam War divided the United States more bitterly than any
war other than the Civil War. It maimed two presidencies. It
undermined the country's faith in its great institutions, as the
left railed against the people who got the country into the war and
the right railed, equally angrily, against those who made such a
hash of getting it out.
</P>
<P>
   It turned people not just against the ancient ideal of military
service but against the ideal of public service in general.
</P>
<P>
   If America's current malaise can be described as private
affluence and public anomie, then Vietnam bears much of the blame.
</P>
<P>
   In previous presidential campaigns the war has been the secret
that dared not speak its name. Bill Clinton could hardly feel
America's pain on the subject when he spent the war not inhaling in
Oxford.
</P>
<P>
   But many leading Republicans found it hard to accuse him of
being a draft-dodger when they too pulled strings to make sure that
they and their kind avoided service. Both Dan Quayle and George W.
Bush spent the war defending their native states against invasion
from their next-door neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, however, is putting the war at the heart of his
campaign. His acolytes do not turn up to his rallies carrying
portentous policy documents, as Bill Clinton's acolytes turned up
in 1992 with copies of ``Putting People First.''
</P>
<P>
   They turn up clutching copies of McCain's memoirs, ``Faith of My
Fathers,'' holding it aloft while he is speaking, often with tears
rolling down their faces.
</P>
<P>
   The book is all about how McCain found himself by going to serve
in Vietnam, and a constant refrain of his speeches is that his
fellow countrymen can find themselves, too, if they will only
rediscover the virtues of public service. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM _ 175 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 375) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The change in the mood about military service began with an
outpouring of emotion about the Second World War. Steven
Spielberg's film, ``Saving Private Ryan,'' succeeded in mixing
bloody battle scenes with an uplifting story about an attempt to
save a mother from seeing her fourth son suffer the same fate as
his brothers, and die in the war.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Brokaw's ``The Greatest Generation,'' a book about the men
and women who came of age in time for that war, has been on the New
York Times best-seller list for over a year.
</P>
<P>
   McCain provides the perfect link between the greatest generation
and the Vietnam generation. The white-haired senator looks as if he
could well have suffered at the hands of the Nazis rather than the
Communists.
</P>
<P>
   And his book is as much about his grandfather and father _ both
of them four-star admirals who saw distinguished service in the
Second World War _ as it is about himself. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The impact of ``Faith of My Fathers'' is stunning. It makes
Vietnam less of an isolated disaster, more a part of a grand
tradition of military service.
</P>
<P>
   The task of rehabilitation is made all the easier by the fact
that McCain spent most of the war being tortured by psychopaths,
not mowing down innocent villagers. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (SECOND OPTIONAL TRIM _ 175 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 600) &LR;  &QC;

</P>
<P>
   On Oct. 26, 1967, he had to eject himself from his aircraft in
the sky above North Vietnam, breaking his left arm, his right arm
in three places and his right knee. A crowd of Vietnamese then
broke his shoulder with a rifle butt and bayoneted him in the
groin.
</P>
<P>
   The guards at the Hoa Lo Prison _ the infamous Hanoi Hilton _ at
first refused to give him medical treatment unless he revealed
military secrets and confessed to being a war criminal.
</P>
<P>
   Then, on discovering that his father was commander-in-chief of
the Pacific fleet, they tried to turn him into a propaganda tool.
They wanted him to denounce America in return for medical
assistance. They also offered to release him, only to have the
offer rejected.
</P>
<P>
   When he was at last released, after five-and-a-half years in
captivity, he weighed less than 98 pounds and was unable to comb
his own hair, because his broken bones had healed so badly. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF SECOND TRIM. STORY CONTINUES TO 1,125) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   McCain's record in the war explains his appeal to two unexpected
groups of people. The first are the working-class Democrats who
came out to vote for him in such impressive numbers in Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   These are the people whose fathers went off to fight in Vietnam
while their richer countrymen stayed at home burning flags and
getting degrees. And they are also the people who seethed with rage
when Jane Fonda shrilled for the Vietcong and Hollywood movies
turned Vietnam vets into drug-hazed zombies.
</P>
<P>
   The second group, the normally liberal chattering classes, is
rather more confused about its enthusiasm for McCain.
</P>
<P>
   Journalists are supposed to like him because he offers them free
doughnuts and unparalleled access. But the bright people's
enthusiasm for McCain runs much deeper than this, and extends to
those who have never set foot on his ``Straight Talk Express.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain speaks to the professional classes' guilt about not
serving in Vietnam just as clearly as he speaks to the Reagan
Democrats' anger about serving and being betrayed.
</P>
<P>
   In 1983 Christopher Buckley wrote a famous article lamenting the
fact that he and most of his peers had managed to get out of
serving in Vietnam. Much of the article was taken up with
remembering that he and his friends suffered not a jot of
deprivation at home while their less privileged countrymen were
dying in Southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
   But part of it was a meditation about what they had lost by not
going. ``We forfeited what might have been the ultimate
opportunity, in increasingly self-obsessed times, of making the
ultimate commitment to something greater than ourselves: the
survival of comrades.''
</P>
<P>
   The betting is still, though more warily, that the Republican
machine will propel Bush to the nomination this summer. But even if
McCain fails to capture his party's nomination, he may succeed in
doing something even more important.
</P>
<P>
   The notion of public service has been comprehensively trashed in
the wake of Vietnam, by the government-hating right as much as by
the establishment-bating left.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to McCain, it might just possibly be on its way to
becoming fashionable again. &QL;

   When book-buying on the Internet took off, it seemed as if it
would spell the end of book clubs.
</P>
<P>
   Now the story looks a little different: not so much new
technology kills old business, as old business reinvents itself to
use new technology for its own ends.
</P>
<P>
   The problem for book clubs is that Internet bookshops offer
discounted best-sellers without demanding any commitment from their
customers. Consumers were quick to notice this.
</P>
<P>
   At Doubleday Direct, which is one of America's biggest book-club
companies, the enrollment rate dropped by nearly 10 percent between
1998 and 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Bertelsmann, Doubleday Direct's owners, and, with 25 million
members, the largest book-club company in the world, accordingly
rushed into online retailing. In 1998 it paid $200 million for 50
percent Barnesandnoble.com, and last year it launched bol.com in
Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Last December, Time Warner's Book of the Month Club and
Doubleday Direct's Literary Guild announced that they were joining
forces on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   But beyond all the panic and the consolidation, bits of the
book-club business are finding their way on to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Doubleday Direct has employed Seth Radwell, an e-commerce man
who helped launch Bertelsmann's online retailing, to run Doubleday
Interactive, its Web arm. Radwell is redesigning the book club for
the Web.
</P>
<P>
   The old, general-interest book clubs are never going to be able
to match big online retailers on range, or on discounted
best-sellers. But Amazon and the others will find it harder to
compete in special-interest categories.
</P>
<P>
   For those niches, where newspaper reviews and best-seller lists
are irrelevant, recommendations are particularly important; and the
online booksellers' automated
``people-who-bought-that-also-bought-this'' systems are
unsatisfactory.
</P>
<P>
   Book clubs have people, not software, to make recommendations.
Book clubs also have a different business model: they are not
distributors, but licensed by publishers to produce their own
editions. This enables them to discount all books, and not just
best-sellers.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet even offers book clubs some advantages. It makes
launching specialist clubs cheaper, because small audiences are
easier to find. Radwell is adapting the business so that it can
exploit this.
</P>
<P>
   Among Doubleday Direct's new and upcoming products are Venus
(erotica for women), Black Expressions (for black families), Mango
(for young women), Rhapsody (for romance) and a gay-and-lesbian
club.
</P>
<P>
   The early signs are encouraging. Black Expressions, for
instance, was expected to pick up 5,000 members in the three months
after it went online in October. It got 30,000, and has added
another 10,000 since.
</P>
<P>
   Doubleday Direct's total enrollment through traditional means is
still falling _ it is now down to around 80 percent of 1998 levels
_ but online recruitment is picking up fast.
</P>
<P>
   This year's projections show that by the end of this fiscal
year, in June, the Internet should account for nearly a fifth of
new enrollments, so that total enrollments should be nearly back to
their peak.
</P>
<P>
   At Bertelsmann, hope is slowly replacing panic. &QL;

easier to find. Radwell is adapting the business so that it can
exploit this.
</P>
<P>
   Among Doubleday Direct's new and upcoming products are Venus
(erotica for women), Black Expressions (for black families), Mango
(for young women), Rhapsody (for romance) and a gay-and-lesbian
club.
</P>
<P>
   The early signs are encouraging. Black Expressions, for
instance, was expected to pick up 5,000 members in the three months
after it went online in October. It got 30,000, and has added
another 10,000 since.
</P>
<P>
   Doubleday Direct's total enrollment through traditional means is
still falling _ it is now down to around 80 percent of 1998 levels
_ but online recruitment is picking up fast.
</P>
<P>
   This year's projections show that by the end of this fiscal
year, in June, the Internet should account for nearly a fifth of
new enrollments, so that total enrollments should be nearly back to
their peak.
</P>
<P>
   At Bertelsmann, hope is slowly replacing panic. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   If proof were needed that we are past halftime in the sexual
revolution, it is provided by a lively new book, ``Father
Courage,'' by Suzanne Braun Levine (Harcourt; 228 pages; $24).
</P>
<P>
   A chronicle of the struggles of a sample of American fathers
trying to find a new balance between what the author calls the
``Triple Crown'' (family, work and social life), it shows the other
side of the phenomenon of the working woman: the phenomenon of the
family man.
</P>
<P>
   It begins with some surprising facts: an American survey in
which 93 percent of men and women agreed that the care of children
should be shared equally by both parents; and a finding by the
author that, ``Not one man I spoke to wanted to be the same kind of
father that he had had.''
</P>
<P>
   The 1990s have been described as a decade of ``men behaving
badly.'' ``Father Courage'' suggests that over the next ten years,
at least in America, men may try to make amends by taking on more
of the responsibilities of raising their children.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the issues facing these (inevitably working) men will be
the same as those that faced women, 30 or more years ago, when they
set out to redress what they saw as unacceptable gender imbalances.
</P>
<P>
   First and foremost, there is the guilt. For women, it was mostly
about not being there for their kids; for men, it's about not
maximizing their pay, about not providing ``enough.''
</P>
<P>
   Both sides also have in common an uncomfortable feeling that
they are in denial of the things that they were best designed for:
the deep-seated view that men are outdoor hunter/gatherers and
women are homemaking sucklers...and rarely the twain shall meet.
</P>
<P>
   There are also social and political barriers to be surmounted
before either gender is free to make the sort of choices that will
transform society from one, as Levine puts it, ``in which half of
human experience has been off-limits to the other half of the
population.''
</P>
<P>
   The political landscape could be tilted more in favor of
families, she believes, whilst in the workplace there is ``the
unabated pressure on a man to perform as if he had no other life.''
Employers are rarely as accommodating as they might be.
</P>
<P>
   For Levine, ``The courage to renounce travel stands out as the
signal act of a truly committed parent.'' But few of the companies
which profess to be so keen on equal opportunities for women take
pains to accommodate the fathers who want to be home when the
equally-opportuned mums are not.
</P>
<P>
   Even in the home, Levine says that men have to fight for
equality. Women, she says, are reluctant to ``relinquish the
mystical powers attributed to motherhood and really share the glory
as well as the housework.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the issues facing today's superdads are quite different
from those that faced yesterday's supermums.
</P>
<P>
   By traditional standards, women were fighting to take a step up.
But by those same standards, men are often asking to take a step
down. This presents problems, not so much because it's a step down
to change baby's diapers, but because it's a step down to earn less
than baby's mum.
</P>
<P>
   It makes competition between the sexes continuous and on all
fronts. It turns women into breadwinners and men into consumers.
</P>
<P>
   The pity is that Levine's study is limited to the United States.
For only there has the cohort of baby-boomer supermums created a
generation of men that want to be superdads _ that want (like their
mothers) to have a go at having it all.
</P>
<P>
   In most other parts of the world, women are still raising their
boys to expect the old-style contract in which, in return for
breadwinning, they gain a support structure that keeps their
children (and much else) at arm's length.
</P>
<P>
   Underlying the change in America is the assumption that there is
little that is more rewarding for any parent than to walk
hand-in-hand to school with their adoring seven-year-old and no
agenda other than the walk.
</P>
<P>
   Some fathers have yet to be convinced of this. Even when they
know they can't have it all, they still think they'll be better off
as the chairman of General Motors. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   By and large, scientists are an optimistic bunch. They are quite
happy to leave fretting about doom and gloom to the philosophers.
</P>
<P>
   Some of them can even remain cheerful when considering something
that most people would regard as deeply depressing: the eventual
destruction of the earth.
</P>
<P>
   The earth's fate is tied to that of the sun, which the laws of
stellar evolution suggest will swell into a ``red giant,''
swallowing the earth up in about five billion years' time.
</P>
<P>
   The details, however, are obscure. George Bowen and Lee Ann
Willson of Iowa State University decided to work them out.
</P>
<P>
   Their calculations suggest that the earth will survive the sun's
initial sudden swelling, but that the drag from the expanded solar
atmosphere will then cause its orbit to shrink until it is
consumed.
</P>
<P>
   The landscape shortly before the end will be apocalyptic indeed.
The surface temperature will reach 2,000 degrees C (3632 degrees
F), the oceans and the atmosphere having long since boiled away.
</P>
<P>
   This will produce a new atmosphere, which will consist not of
oxygen and nitrogen but of vaporized rock. The sky will be a deep,
vivid red because the sun will, in essence, have turned into a huge
red cloud.
</P>
<P>
   The moon will have gone (atmospheric drag will cause it to crash
into the earth). Mars and Jupiter, tearing through the outer
reaches of the solar cloud at supersonic speeds, will appear as
bright streaks in the sky.
</P>
<P>
   The earth's death spiral will last about 2 million years, as its
orbit shrinks and the sun continues to expand.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in a flash, it will all be over. The planet will plummet
into the heart of the sun and disappear.
</P>
<P>
   Or will it? Fred Adams, a physicist at the University of
Michigan, has proposed a novel way in which the earth might escape
this fate.
</P>
<P>
   By running repeated computer simulations, he has worked out what
would happen if a red-dwarf star were to pass through the solar
system.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Adams has found that there is one chance in 100,000 that
this would cause the earth to be ejected from the solar system
before the sun becomes a red giant. The planet would then meet an
icy, rather than a fiery end, since after a million years or so the
oceans would freeze solid.
</P>
<P>
   Bacteria would still be able to live in hydrothermal vents at
the bottom of the oceans, kept going by heat generated
radioactively in the earth's crust. Indeed, they might survive for
as long as 30 billion years. But without a star to keep the earth
warm, other forms of life would be doomed to a chilly death.
</P>
<P>
   In a forthcoming paper in Icarus, however, Dr. Adams advances
another intriguing possibility: the earth could desert the sun and
team up with another star.
</P>
<P>
   This would require a pair of red dwarfs to encounter the solar
system and perform an elaborate gravitational dance with it for a
few thousand years.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of this time, the earth would elope with one of the
red dwarfs, which are extremely long-lived stars and would keep it
at least feebly warm for billions more years.
</P>
<P>
   Admittedly, the chances of this happening are only one in 3
million. But compared with being burned to a crisp, it would not be
the end of the world. &QL;

FALSE NAME TIPPED POLICE TO CROOKED COP
</HEADLINE>
 By GREG GITTRICH 
and BETH BARRETT  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The name on the Rampart Division evidence room's
sign-out sheet for the eight pounds of cocaine was Perez, and the
badge number belonged to Los Angeles Police Department Officer Joel
Perez. The name fit the crime, but it was the wrong Perez.
</P>
<P>
   Joel Perez wasn't even working at Rampart when Rafael Perez
decided to use Joel's badge number to steal cocaine from an
evidence locker March 2, 1998.
</P>
<P>
   So when Joel Perez received an overdue property statement a week
later, saying a large quantity of cocaine had been charged out to
him in a case in which he was not involved, he thought it must be a
clerical error, sources close to the investigation said.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks later, when the cocaine still had not been returned,
the department's computer issued a second notice, this time to
supervisor Lt. John Cooney, who asked Joel Perez about it, sources
said. Cooney could not be reached immediately for comment.
</P>
<P>
   ``As I understand it, he gets the second notice and goes, wow, I
didn't check out that dope,'' said Ted Hunt, president of the
Police Protective League.
</P>
<P>
   Mystified and concerned, Joel Perez went to the property room,
where the clerk who checked the drugs out confirmed he was not the
one who had requested them, sources said. Handwriting samples
verified that someone else signed for the drugs.
</P>
<P>
   That launched the investigation that led to the arrest of Rafael
Perez, who eventually turned informant and exposed the worst
scandal in LAPD history, a litany of crimes and rights abuses that
may have sent hundreds of people to prison on frame-ups and almost
certainly will lead to massive reforms in the LAPD.
</P>
<P>
   Sources confirmed that the Internal Affairs Division began its
investigation March 27, 1998, one day after Joel Perez received the
second notice, and that he was interviewed three days later.
</P>
<P>
   ``Joel did exactly what he was supposed to be doing,'' a source
said.
</P>
<P>
   Hunt said Joel Perez is an honest officer who wanted his name
and badge number cleared immediately and sought the union's advice
on how to do it. Hunt said he believes Joel Perez's actions
prompted the department's inquiry, an assertion that LAPD
investigators dispute.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't imagine Internal Affairs acting that rapidly,'' Hunt
claimed, if the union had not prodded. According to Hunt, the
union's general counsel said Internal Affairs investigators were
not working on the case until the union got involved.
</P>
<P>
   Sources said Rafael Perez chose a forgery victim with the same
last name, so he could flash his own badge if questioned in the
property room, but with a different serial number, so the sign-out
would be difficult to trace.
</P>
<P>
   Rafael Perez was sentenced Friday to five years in prison on a
plea deal in exchange for providing information on alleged
widespread corruption within the LAPD.
</P>
<P>
   ``The honest Perez had nothing to do with it; the crooked Perez
was forging the honest Perez's name,'' Hunt added.
</P>
<P>
   Sources said that if Rafael Perez had substituted flour for
cocaine and returned the evidence bags, as he had done in the past,
he might have gotten away with the crime in Joel Perez's name.
Narcotics were not routinely retested when officers returned them
from court, with only random tests before evidence is destroyed
after trial.
</P>
<P>
   As the LAPD reels from Rafael Perez's testimony that hundreds of
cases may have been tainted by dozens of dirty cops, Hunt said Joel
Perez's honesty and cooperation illustrates what is routine for
most police officers. ``He did what every honest cop should do,''
Hunt said. ``You take care that all your cards are on the table.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   By and large, scientists are an optimistic bunch. They are quite
happy to leave fretting about doom and gloom to the philosophers.
</P>
<P>
   Some of them can even remain cheerful when considering something
that most people would regard as deeply depressing: the eventual
destruction of the earth.
</P>
<P>
   The earth's fate is tied to that of the sun, which the laws of
stellar evolution suggest will swell into a ``red giant,''
swallowing the earth up in about five billion years' time.
</P>
<P>
   The details, however, are obscure. George Bowen and Lee Ann
Willson of Iowa State University decided to work them out.
</P>
<P>
   Their calculations suggest that the earth will survive the sun's
initial sudden swelling, but that the drag from the expanded solar
atmosphere will then cause its orbit to shrink until it is
consumed.
</P>
<P>
   The landscape shortly before the end will be apocalyptic indeed.
The surface temperature will reach 2,000 degrees C (3632 degrees
F), the oceans and the atmosphere having long since boiled away.
</P>
<P>
   This will produce a new atmosphere, which will consist not of
oxygen and nitrogen but of vaporized rock. The sky will be a deep,
vivid red because the sun will, in essence, have turned into a huge
red cloud.
</P>
<P>
   The moon will have gone (atmospheric drag will cause it to crash
into the earth). Mars and Jupiter, tearing through the outer
reaches of the solar cloud at supersonic speeds, will appear as
bright streaks in the sky.
</P>
<P>
   The earth's death spiral will last about 2 million years, as its
orbit shrinks and the sun continues to expand.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in a flash, it will all be over. The planet will plummet
into the heart of the sun and disappear.
</P>
<P>
   Or will it? Fred Adams, a physicist at the University of
Michigan, has proposed a novel way in which the earth might escape
this fate.
</P>
<P>
   By running repeated computer simulations, he has worked out what
would happen if a red-dwarf star were to pass through the solar
system.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Adams has found that there is one chance in 100,000 that
this would cause the earth to be ejected from the solar system
before the sun becomes a red giant. The planet would then meet an
icy, rather than a fiery end, since after a million years or so the
oceans would freeze solid.
</P>
<P>
   Bacteria would still be able to live in hydrothermal vents at
the bottom of the oceans, kept going by heat generated
radioactively in the earth's crust. Indeed, they might survive for
as long as 30 billion years. But without a star to keep the earth
warm, other forms of life would be doomed to a chilly death.
</P>
<P>
   In a forthcoming paper in Icarus, however, Dr. Adams advances
another intriguing possibility: the earth could desert the sun and
team up with another star.
</P>
<P>
   This would require a pair of red dwarfs to encounter the solar
system and perform an elaborate gravitational dance with it for a
few thousand years.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of this time, the earth would elope with one of the
red dwarfs, which are extremely long-lived stars and would keep it
at least feebly warm for billions more years.
</P>
<P>
   Admittedly, the chances of this happening are only one in 3
million. But compared with being burned to a crisp, it would not be
the end of the world. &QL;

DRUG-RESISTANT GERMS ALARM HEALTH OFFICIALS

<P>
   &LR;   &UR; L &LR; OS ANGELES _ The 67-yearold man came to St. Joseph's
Medical Center suffering from an ear infection that just wouldn't
go away.
</P>
<P>
   It nearly killed him.
</P>
<P>
   First-line antibiotics didn't stop the bug that caused his
earache, allowing it to race through his bloodstream and attack his
heart. Now, after surgery and four weeks of treatment with one of
the most toxic and expensive antibiotics, doctors say they believe
the Glendale-area man will live.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been in practice for 20 years _ and this is something
definitely different,'' said Dr. Milton Louie, an infectious
disease specialist who advises epidemiologists at St. Joseph's and
two other area hospitals. For reasons of privacy, he declined to
identify his patient.
</P>
<P>
   What attacked this man so viciously was a strain of
drug-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae, among a growing number of
super-bacteria that doctors said have baffled them by appearing
across Los Angeles County in seemingly otherwise healthy people.
</P>
<P>
   ``The majority of the cases of the resistant bacteria, we have a
really good reason why they're resistant,'' said Dr. Arleen
Rockoff, chief of infectious diseases at Kaiser Permanente Medical
Center in Woodland Hills. ``The thing that's different about these
ones is that these are ones that are basic healthy folks.''
</P>
<P>
   Public health officials blame overuse and inappropriate use of
antibiotics for the steady increase in bacterial imperviousness,
but they also note that germs naturally develop resistance over
time.
</P>
<P>
   A handful of new antibiotics await approval by the Food and Drug
Administration and a pneumonia vaccine for infants just approved
Thursday promises help in the battle against bacteria. Physicians,
wonder, though how much progress once easily treatable strains will
make in the meantime.
</P>
<P>
   In Los Angeles County, the percentage of pneumonia patients
stricken with drug-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae has crept
slowly upward since 1996, the year the county began tracking cases
in response to the threat.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, 24 percent of the 659 pneumonia cases reported to the
county Department of Health Services involved bacteria resistant to
penicillin. In the first six months of 1999, that rose to 28.9
percent. Streptococcus resistance to another common class of drugs,
cephalosporins, rose similarly, from 10 percent of reported cases
in 1998 to 14.9 percent in the first six months of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Area hospitals also reported increases in drug resistance among
samples of different bacteria. Glendale Memorial Medical Center
reported a 10 percent increase in the number of cases of
Staphylococcus aureus resistant to methicillin, the class of
antibiotics that includes penicillin, between 1998 and 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The local percentages match what is seen nationally:
Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus cases accounted for 2
percent of all staph samples tested in 1974, but had risen to 50
percent by 1997.
</P>
<P>
   No one could have predicted what lay ahead for the Glendale man
when he came in with a pesky earache from Streptococcus pneumoniae,
the most common cause of bacterial infections.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1980s, that germ could could always be killed by
antibiotics. Now, in one out of every four cases, invasive strep
can survive penicillin, according to the federal Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention. And 7 percent of the time, it is
resistant to three or more antibiotics, the CDC reports.
</P>
<P>
   ``By their definitions, these organisms are harder to treat,''
said Dr. David Dassey, deputy chief of Acute Communicable Disease
Control at the county Health Department. ``The infection continues
to do its thing during initial treatment so more damage can
happen.''
</P>
<P>
   What troubles doctors most, health officials said, is that these
drug-resistant infections now are beginning to appear in the
general population.
</P>
<P>
   Drug-resistant bacteria strains like the one acquired by the
67-year-old are usually confined to people who have taken
antibiotics before, allowing germs to build up resistance.
Typically, they are found among patients in hospitals and nursing
homes, places where infections can spread from bed to bed borne on
invasive medical equipment.
</P>
<P>
   But the 67-year-old man had no previous hospitalizations in his
record and had taken no antibiotics before being prescribed two
common drugs to treat his ear infection, which had also spread to
his mastoid sinus. He took his medication properly, Louie said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He prided himself on not having to see doctors,'' Louie said.
``There was no known risk factor.''
</P>
<P>
   (SECOND TAKE FOLLOWS)
</P>
<P>
   At Kaiser, Rockoff said she has seen cases of another bacteria,
enterococcus, immune even to vancomycin _ the drug of last resort
for many infections _ among patients with no easy explanation for
how they could have become infected.
</P>
<P>
   Vancomycin proved to be the last resort for the 67-year-old. It
also is the last hope for patients with drug-resistant
staphylococcus, but the germ gains a bit more of a foothold against
vancomycin every time it is prescribed.
</P>
<P>
   ``After vancomycin, you're going to see people dead,'' said Dr.
Brian Johnston, an emergency room physician at White Memorial
Medical Center and a member of the county Department of Health
Services Health Advisory Committee.
</P>
<P>
   At St. Joseph's, the man with the out-of-control ear infection
was given vancomycin before and after his heart valve surgery.
Louie said the drug's effectiveness became most crucial because the
new valve is especially vulnerable to infection.
</P>
<P>
   ``The consequence of this is pretty substantial,'' Louie said.
``You cannot ensure the clean heart valve will remain clean.''
</P>
<P>
   After being treated for the earache, the man came back the
hospital, but only reluctantly, Louie said. His desire to tough it
out could have killed him.
</P>
<P>
   For children, the risk of a raging infection resistant to
first-line drugs is greater than in adults.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Paul Horowitz, a Santa Clarita pediatrician, said physicians
now bypass conventional antibiotics and immediately treat a child
who might have meningitis with vancomycin, despite side effects
that can include hearing loss, severe rashes and phlebitis.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now we're using elephant guns just in case we're dealing with
elephants,'' he said.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Love's last gasp on Fox TV
 &HT;    (Eds: An updated column photo is available from Rick McKay at
the Cox Washington Bureau, 202-887-8348.)
 &HT;    By Tom Teepen

<TEXT>
<P>
   Love did not have a good February, the very home of Valentine's
Day. It was as if Eros took the month off and went slumming.
</P>
<P>
   Few sights are sadder than that of new love, just lit, guttering
out before its flame can come to full glow. Yet, alas, there's no
getting around it: annulment seems the certain future for Rick
Rockwell and Darva Conger.
</P>
<P>
   They're the lovebirds who met and married on national TV in some
fraction of a nanosecond and were whisked away on their honeymoon
before the bride could cry ``Help!''
</P>
<P>
   The occasion was the reliably shabby Fox network's ``Who Wants
to Marry a Multi-Millionaire?'' _ ratings fodder that had 23
million viewers hanging on the outcome.
</P>
<P>
   Fox's sally into family values turned out to have the odd glitch
here and there.
</P>
<P>
   No sooner had Conger dutifully kissed the groom than, as in a
fairy tale run backwards, Prince Charming started turning into a
frog.
</P>
<P>
   Rockwell, it turned out, was a multi-millionaire only if you
scraped everything together, down to the change in his sofa
cushions, and swept his yard with a metal-detector in hopes of
digging up beer cans that would wow the Antiques Roadshow.
</P>
<P>
   Rockwell's movie career consisted entirely of a part in ``Killer
Tomatoes Strike Back,'' the little-awaited sequel to ``Attack of
the Killer Tomatoes.'' According to its web site _ oh, yes, there
is _ the movie is currently unavailable in theaters or on TV. You
can't find it on video and DVD, too.
</P>
<P>
   To boot, spoilsport journalist snoops, cutting sentiment no
slack, not even giving romance a teensy chance, rooted up an old
restraining order that a court had issued against Rockwell to
protect a former girlfriend, a bobble Rockwell sloughed off in his
winning way as the result of a misunderstanding. You know how
ex-girlfriends can be.
</P>
<P>
   And, crucially, the bride sensibly wanted nothing to do with her
pop-up husband. Indeed, when she was picked, Conger looked less
moonstruck than like she'd been poleaxed. Her feelings seemed to go
downhill from there.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Fox's contribution to love consisted only of
inadvertently making the case for chaperoned honeymoons. It was the
first really good press duennas have had in, oh, three or four
centuries.
</P>
<P>
   And no sooner had we romantics resigned ourselves to one love's
sad decline into cross squabbling on morning TV shows than further
disillusioning word came. Tonya Harding, the tough little thugette
of figure skating, had been charged in Seattle with beating up her
live-in boyfriend and slugging him in the face with a hubcap. The
boyfriend is now said to have moved out, which would seem prudent.
</P>
<P>
   The court will have the last say, but in the meantime, what we
do know for sure is that the Harding love nest is one that has
hubcaps lying around, which, I suppose, ought to tell us something.
</P>
<P>
   Cupid, come next February, may be tempted to swap his quiver for
a Kalishnikov.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Schools can't help prodigy
 &HT;    EDS: PHOTO IS AVAILABLE
 &HT;    By Tomasz Macura
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   To the best of my knowledge, I am the youngest person ever to
attend college full-time in the state of Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   I was accepted to Augusta State University in the winter of 1998
at age 11, after scoring 1340 on the SAT (790 mathematics, 550
verbal). I never attended middle or high school or studied material
taught there.
</P>
<P>
   Today, I am 13 and I have college junior standing. During the
last two years, I took 26 classes for a total of 69 credit hours
and earned a 3.45 cumulative GPA.
</P>
<P>
   Why did I go to college so young? Because American K-12
education is the worst in the developed world. College seemed like
the only reasonable alternative.
</P>
<P>
   In my opinion, there are several reasons for the poor quality of
K-12 education in this country. Unfortunately, a majority of
teachers are not that smart or compassionate, which is not
surprising given that some of the worst college students are
becoming teachers.
</P>
<P>
   It's stupid to let people who never were good learners
themselves be in charge of instilling to kids that education is
important.
</P>
<P>
   Teachers need to be taught less about how to teach and more
about what to teach.
</P>
<P>
   Another factor is the negative school atmosphere. It is very
uncool to be smart and to know and understand things.
</P>
<P>
   I am always asked how I like college, and I always answer that I
love it. Studying in college lets me choose the quality and
quantity of my education. Sometimes I take 25 credit hours,
sometimes 18, and sometimes 20. Additionally, I can choose my
instructors.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Twain once said that he never let schooling get in the way
of his education. I am trying to do the same. I strongly believe
that you cannot get intelligence by going to college. This is
something you get in your genes and are taught by your parents.
</P>
<P>
   College tells you what books to read and offers you the digested
wisdom of professors who have spent their lives digesting wisdom.
</P>
<P>
   I would much rather play than study. That is normal. But as far
as schooling is concerned, college works much better for me.
</P>
<P>
   Paradoxically, I have extra time to be a child because I am in
college. Had I gone to middle or high school, I would have been in
class most of the day and then have homework to do.
</P>
<P>
   In college, I have classes only in the morning. After a one-hour
break for lunch, I do homework and study. I have two extra hours of
free time each day by not going to ``normal school.''
</P>
<P>
   I like to scuba dive, sail, swim and play with Legos and
computer chess programs. I also practice martial arts, Tae Kwon Do.
</P>
<P>
   Before I entered college, we, as a family, went through a long
battle. We talked to two principals, one county superintendent, one
assistant superintendent and even contacted the state school
superintendent's office. We tried to find some assistance,
compassion and help. There was none. It was all a waste of time and
energy. It is all behind us now, and we are very glad we overcame
all the problems, real and invented for us.
</P>
<P>
   However, I am sure that many other bright kids and their
parents, who were disillusioned about public education, gave up
earlier, tired of fighting windmills and red tape.
</P>
<P>
   If it had not been for my parents' persistence, I still would be
one of the many nameless 8th-graders instead of a college junior.
How many others like me are there and will stay there? Don't they
deserve your help?
</P>
<P>
   Give kids a chance they earned: a chance to study, and you will
be amazed what they can accomplish.
</P>

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Marching for Fidel
 &HT;    For release March 1, 2000.
 &HT;    By HOWARD KLEINBERG
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ These are the best of days for Fidel Castro. How he must
be chortling. As he has been so capable of doing the past four
decades, he has solidified his rule based on a highly successful
``offended party syndrome.''
</P>
<P>
   When things need boosting, there is always someone to blame.
Yesterday it was the embargo, last month it was the Cuban exiles in
Miami -- referred to even by Cuban grandmothers as a ``mafia.'' Now
it's a Cuban diplomat alleged to have been involved with a Cuban
exile accused of spying for Castro.
</P>
<P>
   Wearing issued T-shirts citing the cause of the day and waving
issued Cuban flags, they march by the thousands in the streets of
Havana, blindly following the lead of the Castro regime. If
anything ever was staged, this was it.
</P>
<P>
   They are told by Castro that Jose Imperatori was not a spy, that
somehow this was linked to the Elian Gonzalez tug-of-war. And so
they march, not the slightest bit knowledgeable about whether
Imperatori was involved directly or indirectly with accused INS
operative Mariano Faget.
</P>
<P>
   This is succor for Castro's reign. It takes the spotlight off
his show trials, his muffling of dissidents, his failed economy.
Periodically, events inspire him -- and he struts out his uniformed
marchers in a show of unity and national pride.
</P>
<P>
   I've lost track of how many marches there have been about the
Elian mess but they have been frequent. Now, there's the booted-out
diplomat Imperatori.
</P>
<P>
   Also playing a role in Castro's favor is the deepening chasm in
relations between exile Cubans and non-Hispanics in this city.
</P>
<P>
   The city of Miami and the larger Miami-Dade County community,
controlled extensively by Hispanics, are unique among the cities
and counties of this nation in that they have their own foreign
policies.
</P>
<P>
   The governmental bodies have enacted laws regarding any form of
traffic with Cuba -- even with entertainers and cultural events.
This has not set well with the non-Hispanics who complain that the
Cubans are doing the very things Castro is doing to his people;
denying them what we have come to call First Amendment rights.
</P>
<P>
   That non-Hispanics are furious about the area's foreign policy
is an understatement. Just last week, after it was learned that a
Cuban-made film would be shown during the annual Miami Film
Festival, the Miami-Dade County Commission voted to withhold
$50,000 in funding for the festival, citing its policy of not
dealing with anything Cuban or anyone who might be dealing with
Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   This was but another in a long series of events that prevents
any cultural link with Castro Cuba. Interestingly, these same Cuban
performers or academicians are accepted everywhere else in the U.S.
</P>
<P>
   The Miami policy is broken every day when hundreds of exiles
travel back to Cuba to visit relatives and distribute medicines,
food and money. The politicians and activists turn a blind eye to
this.
</P>
<P>
   And Fidel laughs again. The exiles bail so many people out of
their poverty and hunger that Castro doesn't have to be blamed for
their condition.
</P>
<P>
   No policy initiated by the United States, or local governments,
has been able to shake the foundation of the Castro reign. He has
lasted this long, not because of improvement on the quality of life
on his island, but because of those who would see him gone.
</P>
<P>
   He has feasted on the ruse that all of Cuba's problems are
created by the United States and that ``mafia'' in Miami. Exiles
carry bumper strips on their cars that read ``No Fidel, No
problema.'' Behind that wishful thinking, however, is the fact that
Fidel still is there and the ``problema'' is seemingly
never-ending, from the White House on down to the preposterous
local politicians.
</P>
<P>
   From this, Fidel has survived when perhaps he might have fallen
years ago.

 &HT;    DISPATCHES FROM DREAMSVILLE: Lessons in life from the great
outdoors
 &HT;    (''Dispatches from Dreamsville'' is an occasional series in
which readers share with Cox Newspapers senior writer Joe Murray
their memories of growing up in small-town America. Back then, or
at least the way we remember it, life was like a dream.)
 &HT;    
 &HT;    By G.C. Irvine Jr.
 &HT;    c. 2000 Special to Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   A magnolia tree stood straight and tall on a narrow ridge at the
northeast end of Big Pond, and next to it a giant holly, and next
to the holly a giant white oak, the sentinel of the ridge.
</P>
<P>
   On the smooth bark of the magnolia were carved the letters LUM
BENSON, the landmark for my grandfather, my dad, my son in our
hunting territory.
</P>
<P>
   The area was located 8-10 miles west of the Southeast Texas town
of Kirbyville, which was where grandfather and dad lived the better
part of their lives. Grandfather named the hunting grounds the
Ponds.
</P>
<P>
   Grandfather was a dedicated squirrel hunter. He loved the hunt
and he loved the meat.
</P>
<P>
   Only at the insistence of my grandmother would he occasionally
bring her a duck or a half-grown raccoon.
</P>
<P>
   My grandmother could make a culinary delight out of anything.
She canned squirrel meat just like she did chicken, the vegetables
from the garden, soups and the like.
</P>
<P>
   Money was scarce and nothing was wasted. Grandfather instilled
in me to never shoot anything I was not going to eat and to make a
clean kill with one shot. Shells were valuable.
</P>
<P>
   Grandfather gave me my first shotgun, a little .410 gauge, on my
10th birthday, and I made my first solo hunt the following fall of
1942.
</P>
<P>
   But for several seasons prior to that time I had followed --
without gun _ in the footsteps of dad or granddad, learning the
woods and everything I could about them, yearning for the time I
would be old enough to go it on my own.
</P>
<P>
   We would often stop for a rest and a snack on Lum Benson Ridge
under the magnolia tree, sipping hot coffee from a Thermos and
downing a baked sweet potato and biscuit.
</P>
<P>
   I got much of my education under that tree, from early childhood
well into my teen years, sometimes tutored by grandfather,
sometimes by dad _ and sometimes just by sitting quiet and still,
watching, listening and seeing, feeling the breeze upon my face,
the spirit and character and of that great tree and that great
place.
</P>
<P>
   Late evenings just before it was time to meet dad and granddad
back at the car, I would linger on the ridge listening to the
frogs, the wood ducks and the owls, reluctant to call it a day.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes quail that had been scattered earlier in the day would
begin calling to one another trying to get back together before
dark so they could roost as a covey.
</P>
<P>
   They would eventually assemble on the ground in a tight circle,
tails toward the center, heads facing outwards, so they could burst
into flight in every direction, should some critter like Mr. Fox
disturb them.
</P>
<P>
   I would have to hurry to arrive at the car before dark.
Grandfather would always begin blowing his fists about sundown if I
had not yet made it, cupping his hands and blowing through his
thumbs, making a sound like the toot of a toy train's whistle.
</P>
<P>
   That was our way of communicating with one another. We never
hollered -- just three short toots blown from someone's cupped
hands and then there would be a similar reply.
</P>
<P>
   I do not know how the name Lum Benson came to be on that
magnolia tree. I only know that it marked a time, a place and a
part of our history for four generations of Irvines who hunted that
land without having to pay a fee, never finding a lock on a gate to
block our way.
</P>
<P>
   And, yes, there came a day when I got to sit my son down on that
ridge holding the same little .410 my grandfather had given me.
</P>
<P>
   He was so young and small, fragile and frightened, yet eager to
be free to hunt on his own.
</P>
<P>
   Reluctantly, I walked away, trusting him to the watch care,
tutoring and wisdom, and strength that came with sitting under the
Lum Benson tree.
</P>

<P>
   BEIRUT _ In the decade since Lebanon's civil war ended, this
country has tried to rebuild from the ruins by forgetting the
brutality of the past.
</P>
<P>
   To many Lebanese, it seemed the only way out of a conflict in
which all sides committed unspeakable atrocities.
</P>
<P>
   But Asaad Shaftari, 44, who rose to second in command of the
right-wing Lebanese Forces during the 15-year civil war, stunned
Lebanon this month with a statement extraordinary in its simplicity
and honesty.
</P>
<P>
   He publicly asked for forgiveness.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter addressed to his victims ``both living and dead,''
he became the first high-level militia leader to apologize for the
thousands that he and his Christian militia contributed to the
70,000 deaths in Lebanon's agony of war.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is something I have wanted to do for a long time. In fact,
something I wanted to do for ten years. But I have never had the
courage,'' he wrote in the Feb. 10 edition of An Nahar newspaper, a
mainstream daily.
</P>
<P>
   ``I apologize for the horror of war and what I did in this civil
war in the name of `Lebanon' or `the cause' or `Christianity,' ''
he wrote.
</P>
<P>
   ``My hope is that my call be understood as the only way out of
the Lebanese dilemma, the only way to purify the souls of those
tormented by the pains of the past.''
</P>
<P>
   The letter was not prominently displayed but discreetly placed
in a corner of page 5. Nevertheless it touched off a writhing
critique of ``state-sponsored amnesia,'' as one journalist put it.
</P>
<P>
   This year marks the 25th anniversary of the beginning of the war
as well as the 10th anniversary of the end of the war. So Lebanon
finds itself with bookends of time that could prompt more
reflection. But until recently, there has been only silence.
</P>
<P>
   Lebanon has no public memorial for the victims of the war. Film
directors who have explored the depths of the conflict have seen
their work censored. Books seen as going too far in assigning
responsibility for war crimes, such as British journalist Robert
Fisk's ``Pity the Nation,'' have been banned.
</P>
<P>
   The only visual symbols for meditation on the conflict are the
ravaged buildings along Beirut's ``Green Line'' that divided the
city, and where massive construction is under way. Some of the
shelled buildings are staggered like broken concrete accordions.
Some are punched by mortar fire, and through the gaping holes poor
Syrian immigrant workers can be seen living amid the rubble. Window
casings and balconies were chewed down from daily machine-gun
barrages.
</P>
<P>
   It is considered impolite in Lebanese conversation to ask
someone about the war. And when a foreign reporter does ask, the
questions are often met with blank stares, shakes of the head, or
polite evasion.
</P>
<P>
   Simon Karam, who was the Lebanese ambassador to Washington in
the early 1990s in the aftermath of the war, said, ``The danger is
the problems will inevitably push to the surface again. The past
cannot be buried. We can't simply tear down the bombed out
buildings and move on.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of this collective amnesia, as Karam points out, is not
only personal pain but a public policy endorsed by a government
made up of many of those who committed atrocities in the war.
</P>
<P>
   There are many leaders of the militias _ from all sides of the
fractious conflict that pitted rival Christian, Muslim, and Druse
militias against one another in an orgy of violence _ who are now
highly placed government officials. Eli Hobeika, for example, the
former head of the Lebanese Forces, is now a leading member of
parliament. Druse militia leader Walid Jumblatt is also a member of
parliament and until recently headed the powerful Ministry of the
Displaced. A 1991 amnesty law granted immunity to those involved in
the violence.
</P>
<P>
   These warlords-turned-politicians are too fearful of their
political futures, critics say, to publicly confront their role in
the war.
</P>
<P>
   The ghosts of this absence of memory are the disappeared. There
are still 17,000 Lebanese who disappeared during the war and have
never been accounted for. Various governmental committees have long
delayed and foundered on investigating their fate. Last month, the
government established a committee, but few believe it will produce
results.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, loved ones of the disappeared live on in agony. For
them the war remains a reality of daily life. The questioning never
stops. Are their sons and brothers and husbands and friends
actually dead, or is it possible they could be languishing
somewhere, perhaps in an Israeli or Syrian prison?
</P>
<P>
   Wadad Helwani, 48, founder of the Committee of the Families of
the Kidnapped and Disappeared, hopes her husband, Adnan, is still
alive.
</P>
<P>
   Adnan Helwani was not a member of a militia, his wife said, but
was an activist in a left-wing political party that provided social
service to war-torn Muslim West Beirut.
</P>
<P>
   On Sept. 24, 1982, he was taken from their home. It was the
height of the Israeli invasion, and he was taken by two
plainclothes men carrying guns and ID cards from the Lebanese
Army's intelligence services. It was not clear whether the two were
in fact acting as members of the Army or agents of the Lebanese
Forces.
</P>
<P>
   Wadad Helwani carries herself with strength and dignity. But as
she talked of her husband's disappearance, of her sons growing up
without a father, she began to chain-smoke. She seemed shaken.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't need to be strong before, before Adnan was kidnapped.
I relied on him,'' she said, her eyes watering with sadness.
</P>
<P>
   When asked about Shaftari's search for forgiveness, she
stiffened. She responded sharply, ``It isn't enough to apologize
just like that out of thin air. He has to be forgiven by the
individuals he hurt.''
</P>
<P>
   In the long afternoon shadows in the lobby of the Commodore
Hotel, where journalists and diplomats stayed during the war,
Shaftari met with reporters last week. He wanted the letter to
speak for itself, but he was willing to answer a few questions.
</P>
<P>
   He didn't look like a killer.
</P>
<P>
   And if the memory of his militia's victims was torturing him, it
wasn't visible in his calm demeanor. The once-rigid posture of a
warrior who carried a machine gun had given way to a slight paunch
hidden under a white sweater vest and blue blazer.
</P>
<P>
   But Shaftari, an electrical engineer who is married with two
young sons, was compelled to write the letter after a recent
television interview with Robert Maroun Hatem, better known by his
nom de guerre ``Cobra'' and a shadowy figure in the Lebanese
Forces. Lebanese Forces is a sanitized name for the Christian
Phalange militia, which traced its origins to the fascist ideology
of Franco's Spain.
</P>
<P>
   Hatem's interview caught attention by offering a glimpse into
the violent workings of the Lebanese Forces, including an alleged
assassination attempt against Salim Hoss, now the prime minister.
Hatem also alleged that Hobeika's Lebanese Forces played a role in
the 1982 massacre of Palestinian refugees at Sabra and Shatilla, as
has long been suspected.
</P>
<P>
   Shaftari said he was angered by ``the bickering'' about Hatem's
comments, and at the former warlords' running for cover. Shaftari
lives a quiet life and said he has no motive other than a spiritual
search for redemption. It was simply the heavy weight of the past,
he said, that overwhelmed him and led him to write the letter. He
said it poured out of him in ``a matter of minutes.''
</P>
<P>
   ``My belief in God gave me the strength to write this letter,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's important to study what happened on an individual basis
before the general one. You can't just put the blame on those in
charge. We were all responsible: those holding the guns, those
giving the orders, even the civilians applauding it.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Young, a columnist for the English-language Beirut Daily
Star newspaper, applauded Shaftari's repentance but suggested he
also provide practical information to help survivors, especially
families of the disappeared, bring closure to the war. People need
to know what happened, he says, not just hear an apology.
</P>
<P>
   He cautioned that Lebanon's denial of its past has weakened the
foundation for its future. But he seemed reluctant to suggest
Lebanon is ready to plunge into catharsis.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shaftari's repentance, Cobra's tattling, and the government's
newly found interest in the disappeared suggest that the postwar
edifice is not as secure as its architects planned,'' he wrote.
``However, before full-scale catharsis is decreed, thought is
required. Asaad Shaftari may be a pleasant surprise, but a legion
of Shaftaris could drag Lebanon down irreparably.''

HOOP DREAMS TAKING HOLD ACROSS AFRICA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KURT SHILLINGER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe

<P>
   BULAWAYO, Zimbabwe _ His first shot caught nothing but air. The
next few hit the rim with the bluntness of bricks. But a boyish
grin, more in the eyes than the mouth, never left Fortune Sithole's
face. It fixed with a kind of taunting certainty that soon he would
slip by an opponent, or jump higher, or fade away, the ball arcing
perfectly. Nothing but net.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm good at jamming,'' said Sithole, down at the Barrow Street
Courts one recent evening. ``But I'm also quick like Scottie
Pippen. He's got speed. He anticipates his opponent. Pippen made
Michael Jordan. He's my guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Funny conversation for the African bush? Not anymore. Basketball
may not be as popular yet as soccer or cricket, but hoop dreams are
sweeping across the continent. Egyptians are known for their fast
break. Mozambique has basketball postage stamps. And in Zimbabwe,
even the girls got game.
</P>
<P>
   Around Bulawayo _ it means ``the place of killing'' in the
Ndebele language _ it's not hard to find a pickup game if you know
where to look. The town has 21 teams, with about 500 players, most
of them in their late teens and 20s. They practice on weeknights in
public parks and schoolyards, behind churches. They play
tournaments on Saturdays that last from early afternoon until after
midnight.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to satellite TV, everyone talks about the National
Basketball Association. Terrance Chawanda saw his first game a
decade ago. He was 10, and Magic Johnson was with the Lakers. Every
day after that, he would practice dunking with a tennis ball on a
small, homemade hoop.
</P>
<P>
   Jason Williams loves the Sacramento Kings and even started his
own basketball Web site. Belia Phiri, captain of one of the girl's
teams, tries to move like the Lakers' Kobe Bryant. And, of course,
they all want to be like Mike.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basketball is a sport that started picking up in Zimbabwe in
the past four to five years,'' Durall Adams, coach of the City
Knights, said during a practice outside the Revival Center
Ministries church, where a bright spotlight illuminated an asphalt
half court. ``My auntie in Boston, Desiree Sayer, sends me a lot of
magazines on basketball to give us ideas.''
</P>
<P>
   There's an unmistakable familiarity about the hoop scene here.
Dreams of overseas college scholarships float over the hard
realities of being young and African _ and of being besieged by
crumbling economies and the threat of AIDS, which afflicts as many
as one in four adults in southern Africa. Given the reticence that
cloaks discussions of sex in African societies, most youths come of
age with little guidance and protection.
</P>
<P>
   Basketball provides shelter. The 21 teams in Bulawayo run in
threes. Each club as an `A' and `B' team for boys as well as a
girl's team. They often practice and travel together and watch out
for each other. ``Teams socialize with us like brothers. They
protect the girls,'' said Charmaine Chirinda.
</P>
<P>
   Sithole agrees. ``There is so much peer pressure to drink and
smoke and have sex,'' he said. ``Basketball teaches us that we have
this precious thing to protect. It gives you a healthy and strong
mind. I am what I am because of basketball.''
</P>
<P>
   But Sithole and others are frustrated by the limits of the game.
There are four regional leagues in Zimbabwe, all amateur. Teams
scramble for sponsors to pay for travel and equipment. Most of the
time, the money isn't there.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, Sithole, who is about 6-foot-5 and straight and thin as
a maypole, played on the national team in the All Africa games.
``We were hammered by the Kenyans,'' he said. He was 21 then and
filled with ambitions. He hoped to return four years later when the
games reconvened. But Zimbabwe could not afford to keep the team
together, and Sithole, sure he'd reached a dead end, hung up his
jersey.
</P>
<P>
   But basketball is on the upswing again in Zimbabwe, and the man
with moves like Scottie Pippen is back on the court. He's rusty,
but confident. ``Just let me warm up,'' he said before a one-on-one
match. ``Just let me warm up.''

THE EYE OF LONDON: A NOVELTY WITH A PAST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN CULLEN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ On a clear day, you can see forever.
</P>
<P>
   Well, actually, you can see Windsor Castle. Which, at 25 miles
from the top of the London Eye, is nothing to sneeze at.
</P>
<P>
   Barring unforeseen difficulties, which given the Eye's history
are impossible to rule out, the 443-foot-high structure, also known
as the Millennium Wheel, will open to the public on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   That would be two months after its New Year's Eve debut had to
be canceled because of safety concerns.
</P>
<P>
   That would be three months after the wheel's raising had to be
abandoned because one of the anchors that fastens the structure to
the South Bank of the River Thames had come loose.
</P>
<P>
   Built by British Airways, the London Eye has replaced a smaller
structure in Japan's Yokohama Bay as the world's tallest
observation wheel. It's not a Ferris wheel; more on that later.
</P>
<P>
   The Eye's troubles getting off the ground have mirrored the
recent woes of its owner, which has seen profits tumble and thus
may have to lay off several thousand employees.
</P>
<P>
   But as part of a plan to turn its fortunes around, British
Airways has sunk $56 million into the wheel. So despite its
difficult birth, the London Eye seems destined to become the
capital's hottest tourist attraction this year, and some say it
could eventually be to London what the Eiffel Tower is to Paris. It
has become the towering landmark on central London's skyline,
dwarfing Big Ben across the river.
</P>
<P>
   While the Millennium Dome, the $1 billion exhibition center a
few miles down the Thames, was supposed to have been the focal
point of Britain's millennium celebrations, it has opened to mixed
reviews and half-filled houses. Perhaps because the London Eye is
not nearly as ambitious as the Dome, which bills itself as an
extraordinary day out _ although many describe it as quite ordinary
_ the Millennium Wheel is in a better position to fulfill lower
expectations.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a wonderful way to spend a half-hour, with stunning views
of one of the world's greatest cities,'' said Jamie Bowden, the
indefatigable spokesman for the wheel.
</P>
<P>
   Bowden acknowledges that the wheel is a critical part of British
Airways' marketing strategy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of the 30 million foreign tourists who come to London every
year, 15 million of them fly, and we carry 12 million of them,''
Bowden said.
</P>
<P>
   British Airways officials hope that having the world's tallest
observation wheel is one more reason that tourists will come here.
</P>
<P>
   And OK, here's the deal on the wheel: This is not a Ferris
because it is supported by an A-frame from one side only, and
because the 32 egg-shaped passenger capsules are fully enclosed and
do not hang from, but are fastened to, the structure.
</P>
<P>
   Already, 50,000 people have taken ``preview rides'' in February.
About 750,000 tickets have been sold, and British Airways predicts
that it will carry more than 2 million passengers a year. Bowden
said that about 30 percent of the tickets will be reserved, and
that the rest will be allocated for walk-up sales. Tickets are
about $12 for adults and $8 for children.
</P>
<P>
   For Londoners like the Davis family, from Kennington on the
south side of the city, that's a lot cheaper than a trip to the
Dome, which would cost them at least three times as much.
</P>
<P>
   Alex-Rae Davis, 6, was leery of getting on the wheel the other
day, so in awe of its size as she stood directly beneath it. But
with her mother Linda's encouragement, she got on.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now she doesn't want to get off,'' Linda Davis said, as the
wheel neared the top.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can see Canary Wharf,'' Alex-Rae said, pointing down the
snaking Thames where Britain's tallest tower stands.
</P>
<P>
   Alex-Rae's 10-year-old sister, Robin, was less impressed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's boring,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Her father, Dennis Davis, wouldn't say it's boring, but as a
taxi driver, who knows London like the back of his hand, he felt he
was seeing the roofs of buildings he sees every day. While
Londoners try to find their neighborhoods, Davis said he believes
tourists will take to the wheel more than natives.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one more thing you can do with the kids,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   That's the kind of sentiment British Airways is banking on,
especially when London is flooded with Americans and their kids,
beginning with spring school vacations.
</P>
<P>
   The wheel has permission to remain at its site, adjacent to
County Hall and the London Aquarium, for five years. But the
structure has been built to survive for as long as 90 years, and
British Airways officials are hoping it will become so popular that
there will be a consensus to extend its life indefinitely.
</P>
<P>
   Bowden observed, ``When the Eiffel Tower was built, it was only
supposed to be up for a year.''

 &HT;    DVD changer offers Internet link
 &HT;    By James Cummings
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ First the problem was finding a way to store a
complete collection of phonograph records in a way that kept them
protected and made them easily accessible.
</P>
<P>
   Later the problem was eight-track tapes or cassette tapes or
videotapes, and now it's DVDs and CDs.
</P>
<P>
   But if your DVD and CD collection is getting out of hand and you
have about $5,000 to spend, Escient Inc. of Carmel, Ind., may have
a solution. The company's PowerPlay device can store up to 200
discs, and users can find and play any selection with the help of a
simple remote control.
</P>
<P>
   And if your collection grows beyond 200 discs, the PowerPlay
system can handle it. Additional changers to hold 200 discs each
are available for about $1,500 each. Up to 15 changers can be
linked to provide a system with 3,000 discs at once.
</P>
<P>
   But the PowerPlay does more than just store and play DVD and CD
discs; it also offers an Internet link that provides instant
information on all the discs in the collection.
</P>
<P>
   Escient maintains databases of 500,000 CDs and 3,000 DVD titles.
By linking to the site, users can click the remote control to
select a particular CD, and the system lists all the songs on the
CD as well as reviews and ratings. The DVD listings include
``chapters'' that mark scenes within movies plus movie reviews and
synopses.
</P>
<P>
   The Escient database divides movies and CDs into categories, so
users can browse only adventure movies or easy listening CDs, for
example. Users can also assign particular discs to custom
categories they design.
</P>
<P>
   The PowerPlay has all the normal connections found in high-end
DVD players, including VGA outputs for video and digital outputs
for audio.
</P>
<P>
   Plus it offers IEEE-1394 FireWire connections. FireWire is an
emerging technology that backers promise will simplify connections
between home theater components, computers and other home
electronic devices.
</P>
<P>
   PowerPlay is available through about 560 dealers nationally
including Audio Etc. in Beavercreek. The device last year won the
Electronic Lifestyles Manufacturer's Excellence Award for Best
Video Product for the Custom Electronic Design and Installation
Association, a trade group.
</P>
<P>
   Additional information on the company is available at
www.escient.com or by calling (800) 372-4368.

 &HT;    Tree people, lawn people in yard clash
 &HT;    By Mark Lane
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. _ There are two kinds of yards _ tree yards
and grass yards. People like to fool themselves into thinking they
can have the best of both. Forget it. You are on one side or the
other. And it's a bigger divide than you think.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, other varieties of yard exist here and there, but their
numbers are insignificant. Pebbly xeriscapes and shoreline
underbrush yards appear in odd places but their numbers are few.
Some damaged and distressed yards don't seem to fall into one
category or the other, but look closer. Each has aspirations in one
direction or another. Some represent the failure of trees. Some
represent the
</P>
<P>
   failure of grass. Almost all represent the failure of water.
</P>
<P>
   Like all great social divides, the lawn/tree division tends to
fall along predictable social fault lines.
</P>
<P>
   Tree people are more likely to be romantics, nature lovers and
slobs who wear Hawaiian shirts before Labor Day. Lawn people tend
to be rationalistic, order lovers and tense people who iron their
underwear.
</P>
<P>
   Lawn people put lawn ornaments in their yards. Tree people leave
bicycles in their yards, often overnight.
</P>
<P>
   Lawn people see tree people as irresponsible drags on property
values. Tree people wonder at the time, treasure and tension
involved in bringing a little bit of a golf course into the
neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   Lawn people fear being crushed by falling giant oaks. Tree
people fear being poisoned by pesticides and lawn chemicals.
</P>
<P>
   In their formative years, tree people were freaks. Lawn people
were geeks.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, these are overgeneralizations. But the lawn/tree divide
also exposes a deep, fundamental and all-too-often ignored social
rift. This division is not merely a matter of yard preferences. It
unearths far deeper divisions in aesthetics, personal credo and
opinions about life, the universe and everything.
</P>
<P>
   Here, I must pause to register a conflict of interest. I write
this not as an unbiased xeriscapist, apartment dweller or
out-of-town anthropologist, but as a tree person. My lot is a leaf
farm that grows thick with scrub oaks of several varieties. Its
pitiful lawn struggles with shade and dead leaves and twigs. Only
an aggressive cat, helped by teen-agers in cars, keeps the squirrel
population at bay.
</P>
<P>
   The trees are so thick they twist like corkscrews to compete for
the little bit of sunlight available. The yard is shady and
welcoming to birds. Fern grows better than grass.
</P>
<P>
   Overreacting to the first warm days of the year, I strung a
hammock between a pair of bluejack oaks that are finally thick
enough to support me. At last, I reaped the rewards of my patience
and devotion to silviculture.
</P>
<P>
   Snoozing there, I hear birds, kids at play and the distant drone
of small gasoline engines at work on lawns. While I rest, they are
at work, cutting lawns and blowing tree leaves. The sound is like a
rebuke, but I can live with it.
</P>
<P>
   There was a time when tree-lovers were the majority and
lawn-lovers an upstart movement. I look at any pre-World War II of
my part of Florida and the most striking natural feature is most
likely to be the trees. Great canopies of oak where U.S. 1 now
runs. Mossy scrub oaks stunting the grass growth in front of houses
with porches. Overdressed people posing by the impossibly large
live oaks.
</P>
<P>
   Road safety engineers, power and phone lines and the demand for
green, green lawns changed that landscape block by block, lot by
lot.
</P>
<P>
   Tree people have beat a slow and steady retreat for a
half-century. And because it takes a long time for an oak to get
dangerous and dramatic, it only takes only one sale to a lawn-lover
to make a yard change its allegiance forever.
</P>
<P>
   We are holdouts, even rebels, in this streetscape. But every
time I am awakened on a Saturday by the scream of a lawnmower, I
know this is the path for which I was destined.

 &HT;    It's time to extend children's schooling beyond nine-month term
 &HT;    By Rowland Nethaway
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ America's public schools are being dragged down by
``an old agrarian schedule, an outdated factory model and an
antiquated wage system.''
</P>
<P>
   That's a quote from Education Secretary Richard W. Riley, who
called on U.S. teachers to work year-round in his seventh and final
address on the state of American education.
</P>
<P>
   It's a joy to hear a cabinet-level education official call the
American education model outdated and summon the political courage
to say teachers need to work year-round the same as other
professionals.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the past 100 years, American education has been defined by
certain assumptions,'' Riley told students, educators and elected
officials at Durham, N.C.'s Southern High School.
</P>
<P>
   ``One assumption was that the job of a teacher lasted nine
months,'' he said. ``The second assumption was that we would always
have a ready supply of dedicated teachers, mostly women, who for
relatively low wages would teach our children their lessons.''
</P>
<P>
   America's nine-month school year has zero to do with education.
It's about child labor. Teachers weren't needed in the summer.
There were no children to teach.
</P>
<P>
   Until about 70 years ago, most Americans either lived on farms
or in rural areas dependent on agriculture. Children were needed to
work on their family farms during the summer. School had to wait.
</P>
<P>
   Although there has been practically no need for child labor on
family farms for decades, the United States stuck with this
outmoded agrarian schedule long after European and Asian nations
adopted much longer school years, which may have something to do
with the reason U.S. students score well below their foreign
counterparts on core subjects.
</P>
<P>
   Assuming that students learn while they are in school, the less
time they spend in school, the less opportunity they have to learn.
That's not rocket science, it's elementary logic.
</P>
<P>
   Riley was careful to avoid calling for year-round school for
children, only for teachers. He said school schedules for students
should be left to states and local school boards.
</P>
<P>
   Officials with the 2.5 million-member National Education
Association and the American Federation of Teachers endorsed
Riley's year-round plan for teachers if it is accompanied by an
appropriate pay increase to compensate for the extra work. That's a
start.
</P>
<P>
   The welcome movement to hold students to higher measured
standards means many youngsters who have been promoted without the
skills needed to succeed at higher academic levels must have
additional teaching to keep them from falling farther back.
</P>
<P>
   Mentors are good. Community volunteers are welcome. Teacher
aides are fine. But competent, professional teachers are best.
</P>
<P>
   Students need the opportunity to learn earlier in life, later in
the day and all year long.
</P>
<P>
   If students are to be held accountable for their learning,
teachers should be held accountable for their teaching.
</P>
<P>
   Standards to become a teacher should be raised considerably.
Teachers should teach in their specialties. Bad teachers should be
fired. Good teachers should be rewarded.
</P>
<P>
   Riley noted in his speech that experienced teachers with
master's degrees earn an average of $32,000 a year less than their
counterparts in other fields.
</P>
<P>
   That needs to be changed to match the way other professionals
are paid, which is based on merit for year-round work.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe that making teaching a year-round profession is the
future of American education,'' Riley said.
</P>
<P>
   That's a start. Student learning is the key to America's future.

 &HT;    On assignment aboard the Orient Express
 &HT;    By Elizabeth Schuett
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GIBSONBURG, Ohio _ For over 20 years now, my friend Gail and I
have shared a dream that always begins with us making a last-minute
dash through Paris' Gare de l'Est railway station, trailing luggage
and porters in our wake as we step onto the platform of our
Wagon-Lits car the very moment the conductor urgently shouts his
final: ``En voiture, messieurs, s'il vous plait. En voiture.''
</P>
<P>
   All aboard the Orient Express.
</P>
<P>
   As we are settling into our compartment, laying out dressing
gowns, and remarking how odd to find coreopsis blooms in the
crystal vase this time of year, the attendant will discreetly tap
on the door and remind us champagne is being poured in the salon.
Naturally, we will attend.
</P>
<P>
   It is imperative, you see, that we meet our fellow travelers,
and the sooner the better. We're not here to play, my companion and
I. We are more than the foolish, ultra-glamorous women of the world
we might appear _ much more.
</P>
<P>
   We are undercover operatives on a top-secret assignment. ``Find
the fat man with the microfilm,'' the Chief had instructed just
before he sent us into the chill midnight of a Paris street. ``The
fate of the entire free world is balanced precariously on your
well-manicured fingertips.''
</P>
<P>
   OK, it's pretty hokey, but fantasizing about a trip on the
Orient Express has been our rainy afternoon entertainment for as
long as we can remember. We've read the books, watched the movies,
and bought each other ``genuine replicas'' of the brass lamps that
used to subtly light the dining car tables. We've even put together
a 1000-piece jigsaw puzzle of two elegantly turned out ladies
boarding a Pullman car with COMPAGNIE INTERNATIONALE DES
WAGONS-LITS emblazoned down the side.
</P>
<P>
   But it's not enough. We want to take the ride.
</P>
<P>
   The Orient Express, in its golden years, carried a democratic
mix of passengers. It was, after all, a money-making business, so
if Joe Shmoe from Kokomo had the bucks, he was only a passport away
from sharing wheels with Leopold II of the Belgians, or Charlie
Chaplin, or even the Duke and Duchess of Windsor.
</P>
<P>
   Ferdinand I of Bulgaria had been born to the deepest of purple
and therefore was suitable to occupy any vacant throne upon which
Victoria of England and Bismarck of Germany might have wanted to
place him. But instead, much to his displeasure, he found himself
the ruler of what he termed a ``ridiculous country.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the Orient Express that carried Ferdinand on state visits
to the Sultan of Turkey, the Kaiser of Germany, and the King of
Greece. It was, in fact, on one such trip that in the middle of the
night when he found himself unable to sleep, this Czar of Bulgaria
pulled the emergency cord and demanded to be allowed to drive the
train. The alarmed engineer protested, but Ferdinand insisted that
since the train was within Bulgarian territory it was his to do
with as he wished.
</P>
<P>
   It took the crew four hours to release the brakes that the Czar
had locked up when he'd yanked on the emergency cord. The
Compagnie, in order to ward off any future delays, came to an
arrangement with the King. He could drive the train within
Bulgaria, but he could only take over at a scheduled stop.
</P>
<P>
   According to E.H. Cookridge's book on the Orient Express, the
letter of the agreement was observed, but not the spirit. One day
as the train was laboring up a steep gradient, it came upon a
horsedrawn carriage parked astride the track. The train stopped in
time to avoid a collision, and was greeted by the driver, a tall,
burly gentleman in a splendid uniform.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am the Czar of Bulgaria,'' he proclaimed, ``and as the train
is on my territory, I desire to drive it.'' Years later,
Ferdinand's son Boris took over his father's place in the
locomotive, dressed in white overalls that had been tailor-made for
his position as royal engineer _ but only within the confines of
his own country.
</P>
<P>
   Gail and I, on the other hand, not having inherited a small
European kingdom, are left with our dream. This summer we're going
to go practicing on Amtrak's Empire Builder. We'll be the veiled
ladies in the club car _ but don't stop to chat. We're on
assignment.

 &HT;    Staying in touch doesn't have to hurt your travel budget
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The question these days _ thanks to the way technology
has changed our lives _ isn't whether a person can go home again.
Instead it is whether a person can really leave home now.
</P>
<P>
   I spent a week away from work, out in the Pacific Northwest
where _ thankfully _ bears and steelhead trout outnumber computers.
Ten years ago, I really would have been out of touch. But (and I'm
not claiming this is a wonderful thing) it was very much like I
hadn't gone away.
</P>
<P>
   There was a time when I traveled routinely, so I learned a lot
along the way about staying in touch. I'll leave the discussion of
the good and bad of that electronic tether for others, since there
isn't much we can do about that. The genie isn't just out of the
bottle, the bottle is shattered.
</P>
<P>
   So instead, we'll talk about practical ways of making it easier
and more affordable to stay connected. If you are a veteran
traveler, you probably know all this. But if you seldom venture far
from home, I may be able to help.
</P>
<P>
   The first item on the list is e-mail. While there are ways with
a national Internet service provider to set up a laptop or a
desktop computer to dial in to the local access number or a
toll-free number to get your mail, normally that isn't the easiest
solution, especially for someone who isn't an experienced computer
user.
</P>
<P>
   Even if you don't often travel, a free Web-based e-mail account
makes good sense for this purpose. You won't have to reconfigure a
computer to use it. Instead, you can use any computer, including
those you'd find at someone's home or a library or one of the many
retail establishments that charge an hourly fee to let you use the
computer. All you need to do is fire up that computer's Web
browser, go to the start page of the free service you use, and
enter your user name and password.
</P>
<P>
   There are plenty of these services, so I'll just name a few.
Check out free e-mail at Yahoo (www.yahoo.com), Microsoft
(www.msn.com) or AltaVista (www.altavista.com). If, like me and
several million others, you are an EarthLink customer, you can
check your mail from the Web (using your EarthLink user name and
password) at Www.springmail.com.
</P>
<P>
   Cellular phones are another way we keep in touch. Almost
everyone _ including a panhandler who stopped me on the street
recently asking for a quarter _ has one. You already know that your
cell phone almost certainly will work in another city. But you may
have a vague awareness that cellular companies tack on a roaming
charge for using your phone outside the home territory.
</P>
<P>
   I am a BellSouth Mobility customer. BellSouth no longer charges
a daily roaming fee (in the old days, the fee was about $1 a day).
But air-time charges are more expensive. I paid 59 cents a minute
for calls I placed in Portland, Ore. If I used the phone for
long-distance, that tacked on another 30 cents a minute. Frankly, I
didn't use the phone enough for the high charges to be a factor.
What did bother me, though, was that, because the cell phone has an
Atlanta number, people in Portland calling me had to pay
long-distance charges (and I was still liable for any per-minute
air-time charges). By the way, almost every cellular company _
including BellSouth Mobility, which offers the All-In-One Rate Plan
_ also has cellular agreements that charge the same rate for
long-distance and local calls.
</P>
<P>
   I wasn't there long, so I didn't try to solve the problem. Had I
planned to stay, I might have looked into one of the cellular
telephone rental plans aimed at travelers.You can find out more
about them from In Touch USA at www.intouchusa.com or Cellhire at
www.cellhire.com. That way, I could have used a local number. On
the other hand, air-time charges (on top of a daily rental fee)
were actually higher than my roaming charges.
</P>
<P>
   Well, good luck on your trip. If you're like me, you'll be glad
to get home, where it's still possible to stay peacefully out of
touch.

 &HT;    Plenty of sites devoted to all things Macintosh
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ If you own a Macintosh, it sometimes feels that the
world is stacked against you. Although things are better than they
once were, many programs only come in versions for Windows and PCs,
and the lion's share of computer magazines are oriented toward the
PC.
</P>
<P>
   It's the same on the Web. While most of the computer information
there addresses the problems of the majority of American users who
run Windows, some excellent sites specialize in Macintosh
information.
</P>
<P>
   The obvious starting point on our Big Mac hunt is Apple
Computer's own site at www.apple.com. Because most Macintosh users
are passionate about the brand, you probably won't mind the
promotional nature of much of the information on the site. But
there's much more here than hype.
</P>
<P>
   You'll find tabs at the top of the opening page that can take
you to areas for customer support, the company store and _ among
other things _ a way to download the latest version of QuickTime
(used by both Macs and PCs to view video and images). Also, take
some time to click on the tab called iReview to get some excellent
recommendations on Web sites for news, travel, music, sports and _
of course _ the Mac.
</P>
<P>
   If you're a Mac addict, then a no-brainer choice is to drop in
over at MacAddict.com (macaddict.com). You'll find all the news and
reviews that the most dedicated Apple-ite could want. Also, you'll
get general industry news. For instance, last week there were
stories about computer hackers, Y2K and the Microsoft antitrust
settlement hearings.
</P>
<P>
   Tabs also will take you to the top Macintosh sites on the Net,
as well as to an area that will attempt to help you with any
problems you're having with the Mac or software for it. Make sure
you try out the tab labeled Fun, because that's where you'll hear
about the latest games for the Mac as well as find some freeware
and shareware games and fun programs for downloading. Also, if
you're into music files on MP3, you'll find some here, as well as
software for playing them.
</P>
<P>
   Another site worth visiting is called the Mac Observer at
www.macobserver.com/. This is a serious site for people who really
are obsessive about everything Apple. The Observer is fun to read.
For instance, a recent article talked about Apple's fiscal
first-quarter earnings failing to meet analysts' estimates. Then,
beneath that article, there was something labeled ``The Mac
Observer Spin'' discussing the wisdom of the Gulfstream V jet used
by Steve Jobs, taking a mild jab at Jobs and pointing out that
``this sort of thing is actually important to Wall Street types.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the handiest features for news junkies is the listing of
clickable links to various news stories about Apple and the
Macintosh. Because newspapers and even computer magazines
ordinarily don't offer great depth of Macintosh coverage, you'll be
able to supplement that diet with richer fare here.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, you will want to take a look at Inside Mac Games. Most
computer users, including Mac fanatics, like games, and this site
offers advance views of some of the most popular ones. While you
can find dozens of Web sites that offer game reviews, this site
does an excellent job of providing the Macintosh perspective.
</P>
<P>
   You can do more than just read game reviews, too. Inside Mac
Games offers you the chance to download demo versions of some of
the popular games. While these demos won't be enough for a serious
game player, they do provide a way to check out how a game works so
that _ before you drop $50 to $70 on a new game _ you can find out
if you'll enjoy playing it.
</P>
<P>
   Hints also aid the game-impaired by helping solve some of the
problems that stop beginning gamers and may be informative enough
to let a grown-up compete successfully with a child.

 &HT;    Media buzz sends Smoking Gun digging for obscure documents
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ While the world, or at least the portion of it that
watches the Fox network, was wondering if the hapless marriage
between multimillionaire Rick Rockwell and Darva Conger was going
to last as long as the TV show did, the Smoking Gun Web site was
busy checking out the facts.
</P>
<P>
   They found out that Rockwell, with an estimated net worth of
about $2 million, also had a restraining order placed on him by a
former girlfriend nine years ago. According to the public court
documents Smoking Gun obtained, the girlfriend, Debbie Goyne, told
the court that Rockwell would ``find her and kill her.'' All of the
offical documents are posted for anyone to see on the TSG Web site.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of this sordid story is old news now. NBC's
``Dateline'' interviewed Rockwell, who said he and Ms. Conger are
probably not going to grow old together.
</P>
<P>
   This isn't about millionaires getting hitched on national TV.
It's about the Web site that's in the business of ferreting out
legal documents of all kinds _ scholars call them primary source
materials _ on the Web for anyone with an interest in current
events or pop culture to look at.
</P>
<P>
   This Web site should not be confused with Matt Drudge's Drudge
Report (www.drudgereport.com). Drudge relies on tipsters and
disgruntled employees faxing documents to him under cover of night.
Smoking Gun (www.thesmokinggun.com) practices online enterprise
journalism the old-fashioned way. They dig for it. They comb police
files, court records and anything else they can get access to. They
do research that's entirely legal, and the information obtained and
posted on their site is available to anybody who has the
inclination to look.
</P>
<P>
   Smoking Gun specializes in posting exclusive documents,
described as ``cool, confidential and quirky.'' The documents and
articles posted on the site come from a wide variety of government
and law enforcement sources via Freedom of Information Act requests
for public documents that the law requires be made available.
Furthermore, Smoking Gun guarantees that all the news and documents
it posts are the real deal _ 100 percent authentic. A notice on the
site reads, ``The Smoking Gun is a Pierre Salinger-free zone'' _ a
cheeky reference to Salinger's 1996 touting of a document claiming
a U.S. Navy missile shot down TWA Flight 800 that turned out to be
nothing more than an Internet rumor making the rounds.
</P>
<P>
   What Smoking Gun typically comes up with is the kind of ``gee
whiz'' documents that you didn't know existed, and if you did know
they existed, you'd never know where or perhaps even how to track
them down.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to uncovering a variety of documents related to the
TV wedding, Smoking Gun also looks into more serious issues such as
the fate of Elian Gonzalez, the 6-year-old Cuban boy whose flight
to America has triggered a bitter custody fight between the
American and Cuban governments.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the documents on Smoking Gun are rough going _ wading
through court papers requiring Gonzalez to appear before a U.S.
judge isn't as scintillating as restraining orders against
millionaires.
</P>
<P>
   Smoking Gun specializes in debunking rumors, hearsay and hype.
When the Andy Kaufman bio-pic opened in December, rumors started
circulating on the Web that Kaufman had faked his death and was
probably hanging out in a bar somewhere with Elvis and other
members of the celebrity undead. However, it was the Smoking Gun
that actually did the legwork and found Kaufman's death certificate
(www.thesmokinggun .com/archive
</P>
<P>
   /kaufmandeath1.shtml) and noted sarcastically that ``in the long
and sleazy history of motion picture promotion, this is the first
use of renal failure as a marketing tool.''
</P>
<P>
   Especially poignant are the records Smoking Gun found
documenting a ``Real Life Private Ryan,'' who, like in the movie of
the same name, was a private who lost all of his brothers in World
War II combat (www.thesmokinggun.com/ryan/ryan.shtml).
</P>
<P>
   Smoking Gun makes great use of both its staff, which seems to
come up with the goods on the newsmakers and pop culture trivia,
and the Web, where documents can be posted and examined at leisure.
The site has made a nice niche for itself as a media watchdog with
plenty of bite.

 &HT;    Climb into the cockpit of Colin McRae Rally

<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _
</P>
<P>
   FOR THE CONSOLE
</P>
<P>
   'Tis must be the season for driving games because another one
has hit the shelves and will keep you blazing for weeks. Sony's
Colin McRae Rally ($50; www.playstation.com) is a hyper-realistic
rally game. If nothing else, this shows how much of a pain it must
be to be a rally racer. Besides choosing a car, you can also adjust
tires, gears, engines ... just about anything and everything that
will affect your racing. With Colin McRae Rally, you also have the
opportunity to race in all types of settings and on all types of
surfaces and you must adjust the car for each terrain. This serves
the serious gamer well, but sets a fairly steep learning curve for
the non-pro. While we'd like to recommend this to everyone, this
game better suits the gearhead.
</P>

   Say Soul Fighter in your best Sean Connery accent. Say it again
like you mean it, like you're angry. There you go. That's the
coolest part of this Red Orb ($40; Dreamcast; www.redorb.com) game
for the Dreamcast, a free-range, 3-D fantasy adventure/fighter with
befuddling swooping/panning camera work that ruins otherwise solid
game play. Splendid graphics show off the power of the Sega's new
superconsole and brilliant animation shows the depth and variety
gleaned from Red Orb's epic warrior arsenal. Alas, it's not so cool
when the cinematography lurches about in an effort to afford you a
better view of the fireballs being hurled you way or the sword
that's poised to prick your buff behind; it only manages to stymie
the fluid grace of an otherwise grand-scope 3-D fighter.

   FOR THE DESKTOP:

<P>
   Who wants Regis Philbin sitting in their computer monitor?
Apparently, a lot of people, judging from the brisk sales of Disney
Interactive's Who Wants to be a Millionaire ($20; Windows PCs;
www.disneyinteractive.com). When we installed the game here, half
the Technopolis staffers stopped what they were doing to wait in
line for a chance to play the game. With work from the developers
of You Don't Know Jack, the game has a similar feel to that quiz
show, but its clear intent is to replicate the TV show as closely
as possible. You've got lifelines, all the music from the show, and
most importantly, Regis. He mercilessly taunts you when you do
badly and pounces on you with ``Is that your final answer?'' when
you hesitate. The game plays well, but has a bad habit of asking
the same questions you've answered in previous games. It also would
have been nice to have Regis read the questions out loud. An online
component to the show's popular Web site will soon allow users to
play along live on the Internet with the same questions that appear
on the show. Until that goes live, however, this CD-ROM should
satisfy any would-be millionaire's trivia craving.

 &HT;    Babies will have a ball with new program
 &HT;    By Staff Reports
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ There's no doubt where Knowledge Adventure
stands in the ongoing debate about the merits of computing for
infants. The company has recently released JumpStart Baby with Baby
Ball ($30; www.knowledgeadventure.com.) The Baby Ball is an
oversized blue push pad/roller ball. We connected this computer
peripheral, which comes with no installation instructions, to a
serial port and then installed the software. Ten-month-old Brooke
went to work. She turned to the monitor after seeing the bright
images and hearing the animated talking bear from the ``JumpStart
Baby'' learning software. Brooke's initial reaction was to beat on
the keyboard and play with the mouse, but when we placed the big
blue ball in front of her, she was intrigued and discovered quickly
that banging on the ball produced a noise or on-screen reaction.
She broke into a big smile, for instance, after pressing the ball
caused an animated toy chest to open. Weaker hands than Brooke's
might not be able to press down hard enough to activate the
software. But with practice and help, maybe this challenge can be
overcome. JumpStart Baby, meanwhile, reinforces the concepts of
cause and effect, color and sound _ and upholds Knowledge
Adventure's excellent reputation for educational software.
JumpStart Baby with Baby Ball is intended for ages 9 months to 24
months.

   GIRLS, AMUSE YOURSELVES WITH AMELIA
</P>
<P>
   Good software for girls is so rare it's impossible not to find
lots to love with the lastest title from American Girl, Your
Interactive Notebook With Help From Amelia ($30 for Windows and
Mac; www.mattelmedia.com), which turns the popular children's books
by Marissa Moss into a fun and funky virtual diary. With sound
effects, stamps, tons of patterns and pens, password protection
and, most fun, an ``Ameliarizer'' that turns key words into wacky
illustrated type, this is a great introduction to what is
essentially desktop publishing. In a tutorial of sorts, the
9-year-old narrator walks the user through all the available tools.
On the downside the interface is not intuitive enough, requiring
adult help that undercuts the whole point of the program _ doing it
yourself. And finally, in what might be the best argument for using
the program, our third-grade critic, after initially spending an
hour or two on it, lost interest in the computer version and
devoted her time to her print journal with real stickers and real
crayon drawings. What parent can complain about that?

   Yahoo Internet Life uncovers online game-playing surprises
</P>

</P>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ If you think you spend too much of your time on the
Web goofing off, then at least you're in good company. Yahoo
Internet Life magazine, in its March issue, takes a look in its
cover story at who is playing games on the Internet. Some of the
answers will surprise you. For instance, more adults than kids are
playing Web-based games; more women than men. And the kind of games
being played aren't the trendy ones. In fact, the article says in a
cover headline: ``More bingo than `Quake.''' While you're reading
the issue, take a look at a list of the 40 best free games on the
Web.
</P>
<P>
   Upside magazine, in its March issue, takes a close look at the
merger mania of the Internet. Inspired by the planned America
Online-Time Warner merger, the magazine decides that it's one thing
to buy a presence on the Internet but that ``getting out with the
loot is quite another.''
</P>
<P>
   ONLINE
</P>
<P>
   The hackers who brought Yahoo, CNN.com and eBay to their knees
did it by literally taking over home PCs belonging to unwitting
users. The problem is that most home users don't have any security
at all while logged on to the Internet. It's easy, even for a
novice hacker, to break into these machines. Businesses and
government use software programs called firewalls to protect their
networks. Obviously, firewalls don't always keep hackers out but
are better than nothing. If you'd like to download a free firewall
program, go to www
</P>
<P>
   .zonelabs.com and look for ZoneAlarm 2.0. Not only will it help
protect your computer, it will tell you if someone tries to break
in.
</P>
<P>
   If you'd like to hear some of the inside gossip from newsrooms
and TV stations, it isn't necessary to find a local hangout for
newspeople. Instead, there is a Web site that circulates the latest
gossip _ complaints and the rumors that never make it on the air or
into print. You can find the site, called Jim Romenesko's Media
News, at www.poynter.org/medianews.
</P>
<P>
   On CD-ROM
</P>
<P>
   If you're preparing to upgrade your PC from Windows 95 to
Windows 98, you may have some fears about the things that can go
wrong. Usually, it's an easy and painless task. But, if you worry,
there is a program called UpgradeAID 98 that serves as a safety
net. You'll pay about $30 in most retail stores, and the program
comes with a $5 off coupon for the purchase of Windows 98.
</P>
<P>
   For the typing-impaired, a program called QuicKeys for Windows,
also about $30, helps automate many typing tasks. You'll save
frequently used phrases and words in tiny programs called macros
that can be played back.

 &HT;    Lab wants to clone your pet
 &HT;    By Mark Clothier
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Technological innovation usually is about making
something better. E-mail is a faster way to get a letter to and
from someone. E-commerce, really, is just shopping from a Web site;
it is the catalog's son, the popular one who spends all his free
time at his computer.
</P>
<P>
   But ever so often, something comes along that promises to do
something truly remarkable: to create.
</P>
<P>
   The folks at Genetic Savings &AMP; Clone want to offer people the
chance to clone their pets. It is unclear when _ or if _ they will
be able to do it.
</P>
<P>
   For now, they're trying to clone Missy, a mutt that is part
border collie, part Siberian husky. Missy's owners gave Texas A&AMP;M
University $2.3 million to start the Missyplicity Project, an
attempt to clone their dog. Information about the effort can be
read at www.missyplicity.com.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, the scientists working to clone Missy said
they had formed a separate company to store the genes of other
people's pets using the same technique developed on the Missy
project.
</P>
<P>
   The company will store DNA on other species as well, including
livestock.
</P>
<P>
   The procedure can be performed on live animals as well as ones
recently deceased. The company stores the DNA at two places; one is
a backup in the event of a fire or natural disaster. The storage
tanks have alarm monitors and, eventually, the company hopes to
make them available for viewing via a Web site camera. The yearly
maintenance fees range from $100 to $150. The first year's
maintenance is included in the initial service fee.
</P>
<P>
   If you're interested in carbon-copying your cat or dog, you'll
have to wait until the technique is improved. In the meantime, the
folks at GSC (www.savingsandclone.com) have provided answers to a
few basic questions about removing and storing pet DNA.
</P>
<P>
   Q&AMP;A
</P>
<P>
   Q: Does gene banking hurt the animal?
</P>
<P>
   A: ``No. The procedure is done under general anesthesia _ by
your own veterinarian in his/her office. When the animal awakens,
it will have two small stitched areas _ one in the abdomen and one
in the mouth. Animals can be a bit 'woozy' when recovering from
general anesthesia, but we have not observed any discomfort after
that. ... For most animals, the worst part about having stitches
removed is being in the veterinarian's office.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: How much does it cost to gene bank an animal's DNA at GSC?
</P>
<P>
   A:''We offer four grades of service, starting at $1,000,
depending mainly on how quickly you need the work done. ... GSC's
Gene Banking services do NOT include the cost of tissue sampling to
extract the DNA _ a procedure that is performed (and billed) by
your veterinarian, using resources supplied by GSC. The fee for
this service is between you and your veterinarian, but for
comparison purposes, the cost for tissue sampling at the Texas A&AMP;M
Small Animal Clinic ranges from $100 to $700, depending on the
condition of the animal.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: How long after death can you obtain viable DNA?
</P>
<P>
   A:''After numerous experiments and actual post-mortem jobs, we
are currently setting the limit for extraction of viable DNA
following death at seven days, regardless of how the body has been
preserved. Please be aware that the actual limit can be much
shorter.''
</P>
<P>
   How long can DNA last when stored using your methods?
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no known limit. Cellular DNA stored in liquid
nitrogen has been regrown after decades.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: When pet cloning is possible, how much will it cost?
</P>
<P>
   A: ``It's difficult to say. We are spending over $2.3 million
cloning Missy. We're certain that as soon as we're successful,
we'll be able to offer this service commercially at a small
fraction of what it cost to clone Missy. However, even a small
fraction of millions of dollars could still be a large sum for the
average consumer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Regardless, we expect the price to drop quickly as our
techniques improve.''

 &HT;    What factors limit my speed on Internet?
 &HT;    By Sue Cleere and Jacki Rudd
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _
</P>
<P>
   Dear Sue and Jacki:
</P>
<P>
   Could you please tell me the different aspects of speed involved
in an Internet connection, beginning with my computer/modem,
requesting a Web page and downloading something? Between port
speed, Internet speed and download speed, is there a way to
determine how good my connection is compared to a standard? Is my
connection faster than my friends'? I'm using a 56k bps modem.
</P>
<P>
   _ Gordon Franklin
</P>
<P>
   Jacki: Do your friends' computers seem faster? Maybe you should
be using their Internet access.
</P>
<P>
   Sue: OK, that's one option. Let's get real. There are tons of
variables. Speed can depend on your location, phone line quality
and how many people are hitting the same site and downloading
items. Even the day of the week and time of day can affect speeds.
No matter how good your connection, if the page is full of graphics
and colors, it will take longer to view. It's like driving a
Ferrari down I-75 at rush hour; you can't go full speed because of
the traffic.
</P>
<P>
   Jacki: Here's a way to check connection speeds. Most dial-up
programs will display how fast you are connecting to the modem of
your Internet service provider (ISP). You may have a 56k bps modem,
but it will make a difference if your ISP's modem only connects at
36k bps. Check your ISP's Web site for a list of modem numbers and
speeds. We checked EarthLink and AOL, and they have helpful
listings.
</P>
<P>
   Dear Sue and Jacki:
</P>
<P>
   Is it better to turn off the computer after each use? When I
turn it on each day, I just leave it on all day. My husband says it
wastes electricity. Does booting it up a lot wear it out? _ Dorothy
Ringsrud
</P>
<P>
   Jacki: So ask your hubby how much energy the average football
game consumes. Don't tell me he never falls asleep in front of the
TV.
</P>
<P>
   Sue: If you turn off your computer after each use, and you use
it several times a day, the repair bill for a new power supply
could be hubby's wake-up call. Basically, you are right. It's OK to
leave your computer on all day. The power supply takes a hit when
you're constantly turning the computer off and on.
</P>
<P>
   Dear Sue and Jacki:
</P>
<P>
   How do I get graphics and photos from the Web into my Microsoft
PowerPoint presentation?
</P>
<P>
   _ W. Steven Allen
</P>
<P>
   Jacki: It's a no-brainer _ as easy as copying and pasting. Any
graphic, photo or link on the Web can be captured by ``mashing''
the mouse button.
</P>
<P>
   Sue: Are you going to explain what ``mash'' means? Steven, if
you're on a Mac, hold down your mouse button over the item you want
to copy. Right-click if you're on a PC.
</P>
<P>
   Jacki: You will get a pop-up window with several options. Select
the copy option, go to your PowerPoint presentation and paste in
the item.

 &HT;    If a program won't open, try the logical approach
 &HT;    By Jack Warner
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ It occurred to me, while trying to help a gentleman
whose program wouldn't run, that the logician's art _ or is it
science? _ can often be used to solve a software-related problem.
</P>
<P>
   Let's assume that one day your favorite program refuses to run,
returning instead an error message that reports it cannot find
wumpus.dll. Immediately we must determine whether this is the first
time you've run the program since installing it or if it has been
running properly up to this point.
</P>
<P>
   If the latter, then we can assume that wumpus.dll previously
could be found but now cannot. For the sake of abbreviating this
enterprise, we will instead operate on the former premise, that you
have just installed the program.
</P>
<P>
   The first step is to determine if wumpus.dll in fact exists on
the computer. To help us with this, we could go to the Start menu
and use Find. Instead, we'll call up Windows Explorer, pull down
the Tools menu, and select Find and then Files or Folders. Enter
wumpus.dll and make certain the dialog box is set to search the
entire hard drive.
</P>
<P>
   If the search comes up with wumpus.dll, then obviously it is
misplaced. If the search does not find it, then it must exist
elsewhere, the only other logical place being, of course, the
CD-ROM from which you installed the program. Oh yes, it can happen.
An installation program can, for whatever reason, fail to install a
necessary file.
</P>
<P>
   If the file is not found on the hard drive, you have two
options. You can reinstall the program, or you can look for
wumpus.dll and try to install it manually. We'll examine the second
option, since the first needs no further explanation and, having
failed once, may fail again.
</P>
<P>
   Insert the CD-ROM in the drive and, once again using the Find
tool in Windows Explorer, search the entire disk for wumpus.dll. If
this fails, search one more time, but this time just for wumpus.
Sometimes programs on an installation disk have a letter clipped
off, and it might be something like wumpus.dl.
</P>
<P>
   If the search still comes up empty, and if reinstallation did no
good, then in the words of a great logician of the past, you are
out of luck and had better look up the number for tech support.
</P>
<P>
   If, however, you find wumpus.dll, then it remains for you to
determine where, on the hard drive, your program expects to find
it. Occasionally the error message itself will provide a complete
path name. Otherwise, there are two main options _ somewhere in the
program's own directory or in the Windows directory. Try Find once
again, this time searching the entire hard drive for just the
suffix, using a wild card, like this: .dll.
</P>
<P>
   This will turn up every dll file on your system, and you'll find
a huge nest of them in C:(backslash)windows(backslash)system. Try
copying wumpus.dll there and see what happens. If it's a
proprietary extension, you'll probably find others in the program
directory or a subdirectory thereof. Try putting it there.
</P>
<P>
   More often that not, in my experience, this sort of logic will
get you up and running.

 &HT;    A taxi driver serves up sci-fi fare
 &HT;    By Staff Reports
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Every now and then you run across a piece of
science fiction that ascends the piles of books about aliens and
space travel, stands atop and calls attention to itself. Charles
Clotfelter's We Aquatus ($27, www. area51pub.com) is such a book.
Clotfelter is a taxi driver in Las Vegas and an author on the side.
His book details a race of aliens who have been living on Earth for
thousands of years and have recently decided to announce
themselves. The book, which blends philosophy and history into a
seamless tome, is fresh, lively and thought-provoking. Especially
satisfying is the exciting denouement. This is a great fireside,
weekend read. And to help you see your books while reading by the
fire, might we suggest the newest in book lights. The Fliplite
Junior ($10, www. BarnesandNoble.com) is a compact, folding book
light you can take just about anywhere. The light clips onto the
back of the book and works well with hardbacks and paperbacks.
You'll also look up-to-the-minute when you use the light: It comes
in a fashionable salmon color with a yellow plastic cover for the
light.

something truly remarkable: to create.
</P>
<P>
   The folks at Genetic Savings &AMP; Clone want to offer people the
chance to clone their pets. It is unclear when _ or if _ they will
be able to do it.
</P>
<P>
   For now, they're trying to clone Missy, a mutt that is part
border collie, part Siberian husky. Missy's owners gave Texas A&AMP;M
University $2.3 million to start the Missyplicity Project, an
attempt to clone their dog. Information about the effort can be
read at www.missyplicity.com.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, the scientists working to clone Missy said
they had formed a separate company to store the genes of other
people's pets using the same technique developed on the Missy
project.
</P>
<P>
   The company will store DNA on other species as well, including
livestock.
</P>
<P>
   The procedure can be performed on live animals as well as ones
recently deceased. The company stores the DNA at two places; one is
a backup in the event of a fire or natural disaster. The storage
tanks have alarm monitors and, eventually, the company hopes to
make them available for viewing via a Web site camera. The yearly
maintenance fees range from $100 to $150. The first year's
maintenance is included in the initial service fee.
</P>
<P>
   If you're interested in carbon-copying your cat or dog, you'll
have to wait until the technique is improved. In the meantime, the
folks at GSC (www.savingsandclone.com) have provided answers to a
few basic questions about removing and storing pet DNA.
</P>
<P>
   Q&AMP;A
</P>
<P>
   Q: Does gene banking hurt the animal?
</P>
<P>
   A: ``No. The procedure is done under general anesthesia _ by
your own veterinarian in his/her office. When the animal awakens,
it will have two small stitched areas _ one in the abdomen and one
in the mouth. Animals can be a bit 'woozy' when recovering from
general anesthesia, but we have not observed any discomfort after
that. ... For most animals, the worst part about having stitches
removed is being in the veterinarian's office.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: How much does it cost to gene bank an animal's DNA at GSC?
</P>
<P>
   A:''We offer four grades of service, starting at $1,000,
depending mainly on how quickly you need the work done. ... GSC's
Gene Banking services do NOT include the cost of tissue sampling to
extract the DNA _ a procedure that is performed (and billed) by
your veterinarian, using resources supplied by GSC. The fee for
this service is between you and your veterinarian, but for
comparison purposes, the cost for tissue sampling at the Texas A&AMP;M
Small Animal Clinic ranges from $100 to $700, depending on the
condition of the animal.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: How long after death can you obtain viable DNA?
</P>
<P>
   A:''After numerous experiments and actual post-mortem jobs, we
are currently setting the limit for extraction of viable DNA
following death at seven days, regardless of how the body has been
preserved. Please be aware that the actual limit can be much
shorter.''
</P>
<P>
   How long can DNA last when stored using your methods?
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no known limit. Cellular DNA stored in liquid
nitrogen has been regrown after decades.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: When pet cloning is possible, how much will it cost?
</P>
<P>
   A: ``It's difficult to say. We are spending over $2.3 million
cloning Missy. We're certain that as soon as we're successful,
we'll be able to offer this service commercially at a small
fraction of what it cost to clone Missy. However, even a small
fraction of millions of dollars could still be a large sum for the
average consumer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Regardless, we expect the price to drop quickly as our
techniques improve.''

 &HT;    Plenty of sites devoted to all things Macintosh
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ If you own a Macintosh, it sometimes feels that the
world is stacked against you. Although things are better than they
once were, many programs only come in versions for Windows and PCs,
and the lion's share of computer magazines are oriented toward the
PC.
</P>
<P>
   It's the same on the Web. While most of the computer information
there addresses the problems of the majority of American users who
run Windows, some excellent sites specialize in Macintosh
information.
</P>
<P>
   The obvious starting point on our Big Mac hunt is Apple
Computer's own site at www.apple.com. Because most Macintosh users
are passionate about the brand, you probably won't mind the
promotional nature of much of the information on the site. But
there's much more here than hype.
</P>
<P>
   You'll find tabs at the top of the opening page that can take
you to areas for customer support, the company store and _ among
other things _ a way to download the latest version of QuickTime
(used by both Macs and PCs to view video and images). Also, take
some time to click on the tab called iReview to get some excellent
recommendations on Web sites for news, travel, music, sports and _
of course _ the Mac.
</P>
<P>
   If you're a Mac addict, then a no-brainer choice is to drop in
over at MacAddict.com (macaddict.com). You'll find all the news and
reviews that the most dedicated Apple-ite could want. Also, you'll
get general industry news. For instance, last week there were
stories about computer hackers, Y2K and the Microsoft antitrust
settlement hearings.
</P>
<P>
   Tabs also will take you to the top Macintosh sites on the Net,
as well as to an area that will attempt to help you with any
problems you're having with the Mac or software for it. Make sure
you try out the tab labeled Fun, because that's where you'll hear
about the latest games for the Mac as well as find some freeware
and shareware games and fun programs for downloading. Also, if
you're into music files on MP3, you'll find some here, as well as
software for playing them.
</P>
<P>
   Another site worth visiting is called the Mac Observer at
www.macobserver.com/. This is a serious site for people who really
are obsessive about everything Apple. The Observer is fun to read.
For instance, a recent article talked about Apple's fiscal
first-quarter earnings failing to meet analysts' estimates. Then,
beneath that article, there was something labeled ``The Mac
Observer Spin'' discussing the wisdom of the Gulfstream V jet used
by Steve Jobs, taking a mild jab at Jobs and pointing out that
``this sort of thing is actually important to Wall Street types.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the handiest features for news junkies is the listing of
clickable links to various news stories about Apple and the
Macintosh. Because newspapers and even computer magazines
ordinarily don't offer great depth of Macintosh coverage, you'll be
able to supplement that diet with richer fare here.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, you will want to take a look at Inside Mac Games. Most
computer users, including Mac fanatics, like games, and this site
offers advance views of some of the most popular ones. While you
can find dozens of Web sites that offer game reviews, this site
does an excellent job of providing the Macintosh perspective.
</P>
<P>
   You can do more than just read game reviews, too. Inside Mac
Games offers you the chance to download demo versions of some of
the popular games. While these demos won't be enough for a serious
game player, they do provide a way to check out how a game works so
that _ before you drop $50 to $70 on a new game _ you can find out
if you'll enjoy playing it.
</P>
<P>
   Hints also aid the game-impaired by helping solve some of the
problems that stop beginning gamers and may be informative enough
to let a grown-up compete successfully with a child.

 &HT;    Media buzz sends Smoking Gun digging for obscure documents
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ While the world, or at least the portion of it that
watches the Fox network, was wondering if the hapless marriage
between multimillionaire Rick Rockwell and Darva Conger was going
to last as long as the TV show did, the Smoking Gun Web site was
busy checking out the facts.
</P>
<P>
   They found out that Rockwell, with an estimated net worth of
about $2 million, also had a restraining order placed on him by a
former girlfriend nine years ago. According to the public court
documents Smoking Gun obtained, the girlfriend, Debbie Goyne, told
the court that Rockwell would ``find her and kill her.'' All of the
offical documents are posted for anyone to see on the TSG Web site.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of this sordid story is old news now. NBC's
``Dateline'' interviewed Rockwell, who said he and Ms. Conger are
probably not going to grow old together.
</P>
<P>
   This isn't about millionaires getting hitched on national TV.
It's about the Web site that's in the business of ferreting out
legal documents of all kinds _ scholars call them primary source
materials _ on the Web for anyone with an interest in current
events or pop culture to look at.
</P>
<P>
   This Web site should not be confused with Matt Drudge's Drudge
Report (www.drudgereport.com). Drudge relies on tipsters and
disgruntled employees faxing documents to him under cover of night.
Smoking Gun (www.thesmokinggun.com) practices online enterprise
journalism the old-fashioned way. They dig for it. They comb police
files, court records and anything else they can get access to. They
do research that's entirely legal, and the information obtained and
posted on their site is available to anybody who has the
inclination to look.
</P>
<P>
   Smoking Gun specializes in posting exclusive documents,
described as ``cool, confidential and quirky.'' The documents and
articles posted on the site come from a wide variety of government
and law enforcement sources via Freedom of Information Act requests
for public documents that the law requires be made available.
Furthermore, Smoking Gun guarantees that all the news and documents
it posts are the real deal _ 100 percent authentic. A notice on the
site reads, ``The Smoking Gun is a Pierre Salinger-free zone'' _ a
cheeky reference to Salinger's 1996 touting of a document claiming
a U.S. Navy missile shot down TWA Flight 800 that turned out to be
nothing more than an Internet rumor making the rounds.
</P>
<P>
   What Smoking Gun typically comes up with is the kind of ``gee
whiz'' documents that you didn't know existed, and if you did know
they existed, you'd never know where or perhaps even how to track
them down.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to uncovering a variety of documents related to the
TV wedding, Smoking Gun also looks into more serious issues such as
the fate of Elian Gonzalez, the 6-year-old Cuban boy whose flight
to America has triggered a bitter custody fight between the
American and Cuban governments.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the documents on Smoking Gun are rough going _ wading
through court papers requiring Gonzalez to appear before a U.S.
judge isn't as scintillating as restraining orders against
millionaires.
</P>
<P>
   Smoking Gun specializes in debunking rumors, hearsay and hype.
When the Andy Kaufman bio-pic opened in December, rumors started
circulating on the Web that Kaufman had faked his death and was
probably hanging out in a bar somewhere with Elvis and other
members of the celebrity undead. However, it was the Smoking Gun
that actually did the legwork and found Kaufman's death certificate
(www.thesmokinggun .com/archive
</P>
<P>
   /kaufmandeath1.shtml) and noted sarcastically that ``in the long
and sleazy history of motion picture promotion, this is the first
use of renal failure as a marketing tool.''
</P>
<P>
   Especially poignant are the records Smoking Gun found
documenting a ``Real Life Private Ryan,'' who, like in the movie of
the same name, was a private who lost all of his brothers in World
War II combat (www.thesmokinggun.com/ryan/ryan.shtml).
</P>
<P>
   Smoking Gun makes great use of both its staff, which seems to
come up with the goods on the newsmakers and pop culture trivia,
and the Web, where documents can be posted and examined at leisure.
The site has made a nice niche for itself as a media watchdog with
plenty of bite.

 &HT;    Climb into the cockpit of Colin McRae Rally
 &HT;    By Staff Reports
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _
</P>
<P>
   FOR THE CONSOLE
</P>
<P>
   'Tis must be the season for driving games because another one
has hit the shelves and will keep you blazing for weeks. Sony's
Colin McRae Rally ($50; www.playstation.com) is a hyper-realistic
rally game. If nothing else, this shows how much of a pain it must
be to be a rally racer. Besides choosing a car, you can also adjust
tires, gears, engines ... just about anything and everything that
will affect your racing. With Colin McRae Rally, you also have the
opportunity to race in all types of settings and on all types of
surfaces and you must adjust the car for each terrain. This serves
the serious gamer well, but sets a fairly steep learning curve for
the non-pro. While we'd like to recommend this to everyone, this
game better suits the gearhead.
</P>
<P>
   Say Soul Fighter in your best Sean Connery accent. Say it again
like you mean it, like you're angry. There you go. That's the
coolest part of this Red Orb ($40; Dreamcast; www.redorb.com) game
for the Dreamcast, a free-range, 3-D fantasy adventure/fighter with
befuddling swooping/panning camera work that ruins otherwise solid
game play. Splendid graphics show off the power of the Sega's new
superconsole and brilliant animation shows the depth and variety
gleaned from Red Orb's epic warrior arsenal. Alas, it's not so cool
when the cinematography lurches about in an effort to afford you a
better view of the fireballs being hurled you way or the sword
that's poised to prick your buff behind; it only manages to stymie
the fluid grace of an otherwise grand-scope 3-D fighter.
</P>
<P>
   FOR THE DESKTOP:
</P>
<P>
   Who wants Regis Philbin sitting in their computer monitor?
Apparently, a lot of people, judging from the brisk sales of Disney
Interactive's Who Wants to be a Millionaire ($20; Windows PCs;
www.disneyinteractive.com). When we installed the game here, half
the Technopolis staffers stopped what they were doing to wait in
line for a chance to play the game. With work from the developers
of You Don't Know Jack, the game has a similar feel to that quiz
show, but its clear intent is to replicate the TV show as closely
as possible. You've got lifelines, all the music from the show, and
most importantly, Regis. He mercilessly taunts you when you do
badly and pounces on you with ``Is that your final answer?'' when
you hesitate. The game plays well, but has a bad habit of asking
the same questions you've answered in previous games. It also would
have been nice to have Regis read the questions out loud. An online
component to the show's popular Web site will soon allow users to
play along live on the Internet with the same questions that appear
on the show. Until that goes live, however, this CD-ROM should
satisfy any would-be millionaire's trivia craving.

 &HT;    A taxi driver serves up sci-fi fare
 &HT;    By Staff Reports
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Every now and then you run across a piece of
science fiction that ascends the piles of books about aliens and
space travel, stands atop and calls attention to itself. Charles
Clotfelter's We Aquatus ($27, www. area51pub.com) is such a book.
Clotfelter is a taxi driver in Las Vegas and an author on the side.
His book details a race of aliens who have been living on Earth for
thousands of years and have recently decided to announce
themselves. The book, which blends philosophy and history into a
seamless tome, is fresh, lively and thought-provoking. Especially
satisfying is the exciting denouement. This is a great fireside,
weekend read. And to help you see your books while reading by the
fire, might we suggest the newest in book lights. The Fliplite
Junior ($10, www. BarnesandNoble.com) is a compact, folding book
light you can take just about anywhere. The light clips onto the
back of the book and works well with hardbacks and paperbacks.
You'll also look up-to-the-minute when you use the light: It comes
in a fashionable salmon color with a yellow plastic cover for the
light.

 &HT;    Babies will have a ball with new program
 &HT;    By Staff Reports
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ There's no doubt where Knowledge Adventure
stands in the ongoing debate about the merits of computing for
infants. The company has recently released JumpStart Baby with Baby
Ball ($30; www.knowledgeadventure.com.) The Baby Ball is an
oversized blue push pad/roller ball. We connected this computer
peripheral, which comes with no installation instructions, to a
serial port and then installed the software. Ten-month-old Brooke
went to work. She turned to the monitor after seeing the bright
images and hearing the animated talking bear from the ``JumpStart
Baby'' learning software. Brooke's initial reaction was to beat on
the keyboard and play with the mouse, but when we placed the big
blue ball in front of her, she was intrigued and discovered quickly
that banging on the ball produced a noise or on-screen reaction.
She broke into a big smile, for instance, after pressing the ball
caused an animated toy chest to open. Weaker hands than Brooke's
might not be able to press down hard enough to activate the
software. But with practice and help, maybe this challenge can be
overcome. JumpStart Baby, meanwhile, reinforces the concepts of
cause and effect, color and sound _ and upholds Knowledge
Adventure's excellent reputation for educational software.
JumpStart Baby with Baby Ball is intended for ages 9 months to 24
months.
</P>
<P>
   GIRLS, AMUSE YOURSELVES WITH AMELIA
</P>
<P>
   Good software for girls is so rare it's impossible not to find
lots to love with the lastest title from American Girl, Your
Interactive Notebook With Help From Amelia ($30 for Windows and
Mac; www.mattelmedia.com), which turns the popular children's books
by Marissa Moss into a fun and funky virtual diary. With sound
effects, stamps, tons of patterns and pens, password protection
and, most fun, an ``Ameliarizer'' that turns key words into wacky
illustrated type, this is a great introduction to what is
essentially desktop publishing. In a tutorial of sorts, the
9-year-old narrator walks the user through all the available tools.
On the downside the interface is not intuitive enough, requiring
adult help that undercuts the whole point of the program _ doing it
yourself. And finally, in what might be the best argument for using
the program, our third-grade critic, after initially spending an
hour or two on it, lost interest in the computer version and
devoted her time to her print journal with real stickers and real
crayon drawings. What parent can complain about that?

   Yahoo Internet Life uncovers online game-playing surprises
</P>
<P>
   By Bill Husted
</P>
<P>
   c. Cox News Service
</P>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ If you think you spend too much of your time on the
Web goofing off, then at least you're in good company. Yahoo
Internet Life magazine, in its March issue, takes a look in its
cover story at who is playing games on the Internet. Some of the
answers will surprise you. For instance, more adults than kids are
playing Web-based games; more women than men. And the kind of games
being played aren't the trendy ones. In fact, the article says in a
cover headline: ``More bingo than `Quake.''' While you're reading
the issue, take a look at a list of the 40 best free games on the
Web.
</P>
<P>
   Upside magazine, in its March issue, takes a close look at the
merger mania of the Internet. Inspired by the planned America
Online-Time Warner merger, the magazine decides that it's one thing
to buy a presence on the Internet but that ``getting out with the
loot is quite another.''
</P>
<P>
   ONLINE
</P>
<P>
   The hackers who brought Yahoo, CNN.com and eBay to their knees
did it by literally taking over home PCs belonging to unwitting
users. The problem is that most home users don't have any security
at all while logged on to the Internet. It's easy, even for a
novice hacker, to break into these machines. Businesses and
government use software programs called firewalls to protect their
networks. Obviously, firewalls don't always keep hackers out but
are better than nothing. If you'd like to download a free firewall
program, go to www
</P>
<P>
   .zonelabs.com and look for ZoneAlarm 2.0. Not only will it help
protect your computer, it will tell you if someone tries to break
in.
</P>
<P>
   If you'd like to hear some of the inside gossip from newsrooms
and TV stations, it isn't necessary to find a local hangout for
newspeople. Instead, there is a Web site that circulates the latest
gossip _ complaints and the rumors that never make it on the air or
into print. You can find the site, called Jim Romenesko's Media
News, at www.poynter.org/medianews.
</P>
<P>
   On CD-ROM
</P>
<P>
   If you're preparing to upgrade your PC from Windows 95 to
Windows 98, you may have some fears about the things that can go
wrong. Usually, it's an easy and painless task. But, if you worry,
there is a program called UpgradeAID 98 that serves as a safety
net. You'll pay about $30 in most retail stores, and the program
comes with a $5 off coupon for the purchase of Windows 98.
</P>
<P>
   For the typing-impaired, a program called QuicKeys for Windows,
also about $30, helps automate many typing tasks. You'll save
frequently used phrases and words in tiny programs called macros
that can be played back.

 &HT;    What factors limit my speed on Internet?

<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _
</P>
<P>
   Dear Sue and Jacki:
</P>
<P>
   Could you please tell me the different aspects of speed involved
in an Internet connection, beginning with my computer/modem,
requesting a Web page and downloading something? Between port
speed, Internet speed and download speed, is there a way to
determine how good my connection is compared to a standard? Is my
connection faster than my friends'? I'm using a 56k bps modem.
</P>
<P>
   _ Gordon Franklin
</P>
<P>
   Jacki: Do your friends' computers seem faster? Maybe you should
be using their Internet access.
</P>
<P>
   Sue: OK, that's one option. Let's get real. There are tons of
variables. Speed can depend on your location, phone line quality
and how many people are hitting the same site and downloading
items. Even the day of the week and time of day can affect speeds.
No matter how good your connection, if the page is full of graphics
and colors, it will take longer to view. It's like driving a
Ferrari down I-75 at rush hour; you can't go full speed because of
the traffic.
</P>
<P>
   Jacki: Here's a way to check connection speeds. Most dial-up
programs will display how fast you are connecting to the modem of
your Internet service provider (ISP). You may have a 56k bps modem,
but it will make a difference if your ISP's modem only connects at
36k bps. Check your ISP's Web site for a list of modem numbers and
speeds. We checked EarthLink and AOL, and they have helpful
listings.
</P>
<P>
   Dear Sue and Jacki:
</P>
<P>
   Is it better to turn off the computer after each use? When I
turn it on each day, I just leave it on all day. My husband says it
wastes electricity. Does booting it up a lot wear it out? _ Dorothy
Ringsrud
</P>
<P>
   Jacki: So ask your hubby how much energy the average football
game consumes. Don't tell me he never falls asleep in front of the
TV.
</P>
<P>
   Sue: If you turn off your computer after each use, and you use
it several times a day, the repair bill for a new power supply
could be hubby's wake-up call. Basically, you are right. It's OK to
leave your computer on all day. The power supply takes a hit when
you're constantly turning the computer off and on.
</P>
<P>
   Dear Sue and Jacki:
</P>
<P>
   How do I get graphics and photos from the Web into my Microsoft
PowerPoint presentation?
</P>
<P>
   _ W. Steven Allen
</P>
<P>
   Jacki: It's a no-brainer _ as easy as copying and pasting. Any
graphic, photo or link on the Web can be captured by ``mashing''
the mouse button.
</P>
<P>
   Sue: Are you going to explain what ``mash'' means? Steven, if
you're on a Mac, hold down your mouse button over the item you want
to copy. Right-click if you're on a PC.
</P>
<P>
   Jacki: You will get a pop-up window with several options. Select
the copy option, go to your PowerPoint presentation and paste in
the item.

 &HT;    If a program won't open, try the logical approach
 &HT;    By Jack Warner
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ It occurred to me, while trying to help a gentleman
whose program wouldn't run, that the logician's art _ or is it
science? _ can often be used to solve a software-related problem.
</P>
<P>
   Let's assume that one day your favorite program refuses to run,
returning instead an error message that reports it cannot find
wumpus.dll. Immediately we must determine whether this is the first
time you've run the program since installing it or if it has been
running properly up to this point.
</P>
<P>
   If the latter, then we can assume that wumpus.dll previously
could be found but now cannot. For the sake of abbreviating this
enterprise, we will instead operate on the former premise, that you
have just installed the program.
</P>
<P>
   The first step is to determine if wumpus.dll in fact exists on
the computer. To help us with this, we could go to the Start menu
and use Find. Instead, we'll call up Windows Explorer, pull down
the Tools menu, and select Find and then Files or Folders. Enter
wumpus.dll and make certain the dialog box is set to search the
entire hard drive.
</P>
<P>
   If the search comes up with wumpus.dll, then obviously it is
misplaced. If the search does not find it, then it must exist
elsewhere, the only other logical place being, of course, the
CD-ROM from which you installed the program. Oh yes, it can happen.
An installation program can, for whatever reason, fail to install a
necessary file.
</P>
<P>
   If the file is not found on the hard drive, you have two
options. You can reinstall the program, or you can look for
wumpus.dll and try to install it manually. We'll examine the second
option, since the first needs no further explanation and, having
failed once, may fail again.
</P>
<P>
   Insert the CD-ROM in the drive and, once again using the Find
tool in Windows Explorer, search the entire disk for wumpus.dll. If
this fails, search one more time, but this time just for wumpus.
Sometimes programs on an installation disk have a letter clipped
off, and it might be something like wumpus.dl.
</P>
<P>
   If the search still comes up empty, and if reinstallation did no
good, then in the words of a great logician of the past, you are
out of luck and had better look up the number for tech support.
</P>
<P>
   If, however, you find wumpus.dll, then it remains for you to
determine where, on the hard drive, your program expects to find
it. Occasionally the error message itself will provide a complete
path name. Otherwise, there are two main options _ somewhere in the
program's own directory or in the Windows directory. Try Find once
again, this time searching the entire hard drive for just the
suffix, using a wild card, like this: .dll.
</P>
<P>
   This will turn up every dll file on your system, and you'll find
a huge nest of them in C:(backslash)windows(backslash)system. Try
copying wumpus.dll there and see what happens. If it's a
proprietary extension, you'll probably find others in the program
directory or a subdirectory thereof. Try putting it there.
</P>
<P>
   More often that not, in my experience, this sort of logic will
get you up and running.

 &HT;    Staying in touch doesn't have to hurt your travel budget
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The question these days _ thanks to the way technology
has changed our lives _ isn't whether a person can go home again.
Instead it is whether a person can really leave home now.
</P>
<P>
   I spent a week away from work, out in the Pacific Northwest
where _ thankfully _ bears and steelhead trout outnumber computers.
Ten years ago, I really would have been out of touch. But (and I'm
not claiming this is a wonderful thing) it was very much like I
hadn't gone away.
</P>
<P>
   There was a time when I traveled routinely, so I learned a lot
along the way about staying in touch. I'll leave the discussion of
the good and bad of that electronic tether for others, since there
isn't much we can do about that. The genie isn't just out of the
bottle, the bottle is shattered.
</P>
<P>
   So instead, we'll talk about practical ways of making it easier
and more affordable to stay connected. If you are a veteran
traveler, you probably know all this. But if you seldom venture far
from home, I may be able to help.
</P>
<P>
   The first item on the list is e-mail. While there are ways with
a national Internet service provider to set up a laptop or a
desktop computer to dial in to the local access number or a
toll-free number to get your mail, normally that isn't the easiest
solution, especially for someone who isn't an experienced computer
user.
</P>
<P>
   Even if you don't often travel, a free Web-based e-mail account
makes good sense for this purpose. You won't have to reconfigure a
computer to use it. Instead, you can use any computer, including
those you'd find at someone's home or a library or one of the many
retail establishments that charge an hourly fee to let you use the
computer. All you need to do is fire up that computer's Web
browser, go to the start page of the free service you use, and
enter your user name and password.
</P>
<P>
   There are plenty of these services, so I'll just name a few.
Check out free e-mail at Yahoo (www.yahoo.com), Microsoft
(www.msn.com) or AltaVista (www.altavista.com). If, like me and
several million others, you are an EarthLink customer, you can
check your mail from the Web (using your EarthLink user name and
password) at Www.springmail.com.
</P>
<P>
   Cellular phones are another way we keep in touch. Almost
everyone _ including a panhandler who stopped me on the street
recently asking for a quarter _ has one. You already know that your
cell phone almost certainly will work in another city. But you may
have a vague awareness that cellular companies tack on a roaming
charge for using your phone outside the home territory.
</P>
<P>
   I am a BellSouth Mobility customer. BellSouth no longer charges
a daily roaming fee (in the old days, the fee was about $1 a day).
But air-time charges are more expensive. I paid 59 cents a minute
for calls I placed in Portland, Ore. If I used the phone for
long-distance, that tacked on another 30 cents a minute. Frankly, I
didn't use the phone enough for the high charges to be a factor.
What did bother me, though, was that, because the cell phone has an
Atlanta number, people in Portland calling me had to pay
long-distance charges (and I was still liable for any per-minute
air-time charges). By the way, almost every cellular company _
including BellSouth Mobility, which offers the All-In-One Rate Plan
_ also has cellular agreements that charge the same rate for
long-distance and local calls.
</P>
<P>
   I wasn't there long, so I didn't try to solve the problem. Had I
planned to stay, I might have looked into one of the cellular
telephone rental plans aimed at travelers.You can find out more
about them from In Touch USA at www.intouchusa.com or Cellhire at
www.cellhire.com. That way, I could have used a local number. On
the other hand, air-time charges (on top of a daily rental fee)
were actually higher than my roaming charges.
</P>
<P>
   Well, good luck on your trip. If you're like me, you'll be glad
to get home, where it's still possible to stay peacefully out of
touch.

 &HT;    In this town, you make the sprawl
 &HT;    By Michael Barnes
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ The most popular electronic games these days
sharpen reflexes, promote computer skills and release the inner
barbarian in millions of (mostly) boys from ages five to 50.
</P>
<P>
   One exception among the gaming victors _ SimCity from Maxis
Systems, now in its third upgrade _ requires exacting patience,
promotes understanding of complex forces and releases the inner
mayor in thousands of aspiring architects, activists, planners and
urban empire builders.
</P>
<P>
   SimCity 3000, less than a year old and the most sophisticated
version, has captured the fancy of real Austin designers and
planners. And it is even saving lives in an impoverished border
community.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no comparison between 3000 and 2000,'' said Jason
Andrus, an intern architect at O'Connell Robertson &AMP; Ass. and
admitted SimCity junkie. ``Everything from the graphics to the
increase in options for all aspects of city design to the budget
control are better. It has enough realism to suck me in and keep me
entertained for hours.''
</P>
<P>
   All three versions of the game _ classic, 2000 and 3000 _ are
based on the same principles. The player starts with a grid, then
adds zoning, utility lines, streets, schools, fire stations, police
stations, ports, airports and other municipal amenities, while
balancing a budget and overseeing the commercial climate of each
new city. Just as in any real metropolis, however, the player
cannot actually control the growth of population, industry and
trade, which respond to the combined forces of space, time,
material and human energy.
</P>
<P>
   The only informal rules: Make the right decisions and do no
harm.
</P>
<P>
   The second edition, which arrived in 1994, added color to
topographical maps that could be altered with seemingly infinite
flexibility.
</P>
<P>
   The player could now operate underground systems and better mass
transit, create ordinances, track budgets and put certain functions
on auto-drive. It also duplicated real trends, by allowing the
player to add technologies only when the game's date matched
historical availability.
</P>
<P>
   Critics, however, said SimCity 2000 favored single-use zoning
over mixed-use development, the Holy Grail of new urbanism, and
emphasized gimmicks, like natural disasters and futuristic bubble
communities.
</P>
<P>
   It was advanced enough that City of Austin architect Nathan
Schneider and colleagues played the game when rethinking Austin's
land development a few years back.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lesson: If you don't plan for development and its related
impacts, you will be faced with consequences that you cannot
address adequately,'' Schneider said. ``Then you will have limited
options, no time and always be acting in a crisis mode.''
</P>
<P>
   REAL-WORLD APPLICATIONS
</P>
<P>
   SimCity 3000 is already taking hold in architecture schools and
offices, as well as in everyday game rooms, though the redesign has
attracted its share of criticism.
</P>
<P>
   ``The newest version has some amazing improvements and some
things I don't like,'' said Paul Thompson, an intern architect at
Graeber, Simmons and Cowan Architects. ``It allows you to get down
to a very close level and watch people walking on the streets and
cars driving by, which adds to the realism. But they have also made
the interface simpler and more nontechnical than it used to be,
which makes it easier for most players, but also makes it feel kind
of more like a cartoon.''
</P>
<P>
   ``All of the basic stuff that cities deal with is there,''
Andrus said. ``But whenever I experiment with radical changes, the
results defy realism. It seems to be based around the most
efficient and simple ways to lay a city out and manage it. I
usually do very well with 'donuts' and other dull layouts that
represent blunderous planning, similar to Plano.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am currently experimenting with laying out a city based on
Austin's layout and Austin's history of development and I am
interested to see how the game responds,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   COOL SCHOOL TOOL
</P>
<P>
   As of yet, SimCity has entertained and educated many, but makes
no demonstrable changes on the real world. Not so in El Cenizo, a
colonia in the Rio Grande Valley, where schoolchildren used the
related game, SimTown, to change to their environments for good.
</P>
<P>
   ``They took notebooks and pencils and walked up and down the two
streets, counting the number of residential, commercial and public
structures and noting other physical characteristics such as trash,
vegetation, paving,'' said Austin's Mary Burns, a technical program
associate with the Southwest Educational Development Laboratory.
``They then 'recreated' these two main streets as a prototype of
their community using SimTown.''
</P>
<P>
   When the children played the game, their virtual El Cenizo kept
burning down because players had not created water bodies in their
communities. This emulated reality, since El Cenizo, like many
colonias, has little water, no public infrastructure or fire
station. So the children wrote up their findings and presented the
information to the city council and las promotoras (a group of
mostly female local leaders).
</P>
<P>
   ``The community was stunned and immediately began talking about
a campaign to increase awareness about the risk of fire,'' Burns
said. ``In my years of teaching (nine) and planning (five), it was
one of the most galvanizing experiences I've ever witnessed.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, as entertaining as it is, when was the last time that Wing
Commander saved lives of border children?

   AUSTIN, Texas _ 4:30 in the afternoon, on the back patio of
Christopher Greta's house, and he's talking about the block parties
that Steiner Ranch residents sometimes have on the weekends. ``All
I have to do is tell my neighbors when,'' he says. A few phone
calls later, and dozens of families are participating. Margarita
machines are rented, hundreds of briquets are sacrificed in the
name of steak, and inflatable jump castles are brought in for the
42 children under the age of 11 who live in this far west Austin
neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   The Greta house that holds Christopher, his wife Loree, daughter
Marlo, 8, and son Maxx, 7, bumps up against a small creek. While
Christopher sits on the patio furniture and drinks a glass of
water, the sounds of the creek mingle with the sounds of children
playing in the front yard. Basketball, tag and soccer are picked up
during a magical, summery time where winter should be carrying in a
discouraging cold wind, but isn't.
</P>
<P>
   Christopher Greta is talking about another game now, one called
The Sims, and the prospect that a reporter will rebuild his house
by computer, turn his family into digitally animated characters,
and roam them around a house to see what happens.
</P>
<P>
   Greta, who as owner of Austin's Ad Ranch spends a lot of time
thinking about how ordinary people react to extraordinary images,
thinks it will be fun. ``What a great therapy,'' he says. ``Way too
often people get stuck in a routine and don't think about their own
lives.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sims allows a player to create a family, put family members
into a self-designed or pre-built house and then run through the
minutiae of everyday life. There are dishes to be done, TV to be
watched, jobs to go to for money and virtual barbecues to organize.
While the concept sounds mind-bogglingly boring (who wants to take
out the trash, even just pretending?), the game is addictive,
thought-provoking and not just a little fun. It is to computer
games what ``Ulysses'' is to books. The mundane is elevated to art,
the question of what we do in a day is brought forth, and,
ultimately, we are left asking (as our mouse button twitches) what
is family, what is happiness and why does my Sim burn up the
kitchen when he tries to cook a souffle?
</P>
<P>
   The Sims is the cute brainchild of Will Wright, the creator of
SimCity, where instead of managing a family, you take control of an
entire city. Wright, who with SimCity took on the Herculean task of
making city management sexy, told the Austin American-Statesman
last year that he wanted to create an architectural simulation in
which you built a house and let virtual people run around in your
creation.
</P>
<P>
   In designing the game, however, Wright began to see that the
people inhabiting the homes were more interesting than their
surroundings. ``I was designing human behavior at an abstract
level,'' he said. ``That became so compelling, it became the game
play. ``
</P>
<P>
   Wright, who is chatty and friendly like Christopher Greta, said
he wanted to open our eyes to how we live our own lives through the
game, which incorporates lessons from psychology, sociology and
Feng Shui books in its mechanics.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I play (The Sims) a lot, I look at my house, my family,
my friends. People might play this and ask themselves if they're
really maximizing their happiness,'' Wright said.
</P>
<P>
   A HOUSE FIT FOR A SIM
</P>
<P>
   Using photos of the Gretas taken at their home, the first step
in simulating their lives was creating likenesses for them. Using
their clothes as models, choosing somewhat similar faces from the
game's built-in choices and using their astrological signs to
create similar personalities, the family is created and thrust into
a neighborhood that is equal parts mansions and starter homes (This
is not quite reflective of the Steiner Ranch reality, but in The
Sims, there are homes for almost every budget).
</P>
<P>
   Bulldozing an existing house and building a new one from
scratch, we try to replicate as closely as possible the real Greta
home, from the red-brick exterior to the rear deck. Everything can
be chosen and applied manually, from the wallpaper to the kitchen
tile. Windows are put in place (should we use the frilly French
windows, the picture windows or the high privacy panes?) and a
second story is added to the house.
</P>
<P>
   A fireplace, staircase and hardwood patio later, and it's time
to go shopping. We cheat a little, using a code from the Internet
to bump up the measly $20,000 the game starts you off with to
surround the Gretas with the things to which they are accustomed.
</P>
<P>
   There's a dishwasher and large dining room table in the kitchen,
lots of bookshelves and toys in the kids' rooms and the best
toilets, bathtubs and beds that virtual money can buy. The house is
beginning to look like the Gretas' spacious, nicely furnished home.
</P>
<P>
   In the living room, a large console stereo sits next to a large
color TV. Couches tastefully complement wall patterns. A fountain
and a barbecue grill are on the deck, overlooking a creek that
babbles digital water. Upstairs, a dollhouse sits ironically in
Marlo's room, waiting to be played with.
</P>
<P>
   After all the work to build, all the shopping for just the right
light fixture for the guest bedroom, the adult Sim Gretas
ungratefully pull books off the bedroom shelves and sit reading,
ignoring all the riches we've surrounded them with. The kids are
impressed by the hedges, and then run off to meet the school bus,
which takes them away promptly at 8 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   TRAGEDY AT SIM STEINER RANCH
</P>
<P>
   When you start playing The Sims, your characters are
undeveloped. They've got few, if any, skills. They are unemployed,
have only tenuous relationships with other members of the household
and their bladders always seem to be full, prompting constant
visits to the bathrooms, which you, as the player, must remember to
facilitate. Little by little, The Sim Gretas are expected to learn
to live and love. Soon after the game begins, Christopher and Loree
share a few cuddly moments, dancing in a hallway and flirting.
Loree cooks burgers for the family on the patio grill, and soon the
Sim Gretas are greeting an endless parade of curious neighbors who
want to greet the new Steiner Ranchers.
</P>
<P>
   The kids arrive home from school soon after. Maxx shoots hoops
on the family's basketball goal while Marlo goes upstairs to try
out her dollhouse for the first time. Using the upstairs computer
for a job search, Christopher secures an entry-level position as a
mailroom clerk, a far cry from his flesh-and-blood counterpart's
executive-level position. But in the Sim world, it's the best he
can do, starting out. Loree _ who helps run Ad Ranch in real life _
looks in the newspaper for a job, but can only find listings for
``petty criminal'' and ``sports mascot,'' also a far cry from the
somewhat better job market in Austin.
</P>
<P>
   After their first night in their new home, Loree and Christopher
are woken up at 2 a.m. by a phone call. Christopher rouses himself,
runs to the phone and answers. Nobody's there and the family has no
answering machine to field the call.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, a neighbor named Mortimer visits just as
Christopher arrives home from his first day at work. The visit is
short-lived, however. While cooking, Christopher starts a kitchen
fire that spreads, and eventually kills poor Mortimer, who bravely
stands by and screams ``Fire!'' before dying. The fire department
arrives, but not before the kitchen is gutted. The family learns a
valuable lesson: Soon after, a smoke alarm is installed in the
kitchen.
</P>
<P>
   (A check on the real Gretas assures us that the kitchen, and
neighbors, are intact.)
</P>
<P>
   LIFE SETTLES INTO ROUTINE
</P>
<P>
   The excitement for the Sim Greta family isn't over. A burglar
finds his way into the home, but is promptly arrested when their
burglar alarm alerts police to the thief's presence, just like it
would happen in the real Greta's home. The kids come home with
their first report cards. Marlo scores A's while Maxx has to settle
for B+. This doesn't jive with reality: The real Maxx regularly
gets report cards with a teacher's effusive ``Wow!'' written on
them.
</P>
<P>
   Christopher gets promoted out of the mailroom after improving
his mechanical and speaking skills. He's on track for a successful
business career. Loree continues to look for work online, but none
of the jobs seem to appeal. In the meantime, she manages the
household and socializes with new neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   Some of them aren't too desirable: Chip Snooty Patootie, a stock
character from the game, for instance, is a trust-fund brat who
teases the children, insults Loree and Christopher and doesn't seem
to get the hint when he's asked to leave. The real Gretas are glad
to report they don't have any such Snooty Patootie neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes relationships deteriorate: Christopher and Marlo argue
over a front-yard basketball game. But there is also a deepening of
commitments as the game moves forward: the possibilities stretching
out before the Sim Gretas include more children, house upgrades,
pool parties, career advancement and some quirky additions to the
game such as polygamy, floods and freak accidents like the one that
did in Mortimer.
</P>
<P>
   As in real life, life in the virtual Greta household is a mix of
free will and chance. Balancing hunger with energy with comfort and
a host of other variables, they fluctuate between fulfillment and
unhappiness. By steering them in the right direction _ cleaning up
life's little messes while sneaking in enough time for shooting
hoops and going to bed early _ time management becomes joy
management.
</P>
<P>
   When we leave the Sim Greta family, they all seem happy, if a
little hungry. That's quickly remedied by sending Christopher to
the kitchen to start preparing a family meal.
</P>
<P>
   Leading a happy life is hard work, and being unable to do it in
the game may be a bit of an indication that you may need to work on
your real life, Christopher says. ``If your little electronic
character is miserable _ hell, that's your life.''

   AUSTIN, Texas _ 4:30 in the afternoon, on the back patio of
Christopher Greta's house, and he's talking about the block parties
that Steiner Ranch residents sometimes have on the weekends. ``All
I have to do is tell my neighbors when,'' he says. A few phone
calls later, and dozens of families are participating. Margarita
machines are rented, hundreds of briquets are sacrificed in the

 &HT;    A taxi driver serves up sci-fi fare
 &HT;    By Staff Reports
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Every now and then you run across a piece of
science fiction that ascends the piles of books about aliens and
space travel, stands atop and calls attention to itself. Charles
Clotfelter's We Aquatus ($27, www. area51pub.com) is such a book.
Clotfelter is a taxi driver in Las Vegas and an author on the side.
His book details a race of aliens who have been living on Earth for
thousands of years and have recently decided to announce
themselves. The book, which blends philosophy and history into a
seamless tome, is fresh, lively and thought-provoking. Especially
satisfying is the exciting denouement. This is a great fireside,
weekend read. And to help you see your books while reading by the
fire, might we suggest the newest in book lights. The Fliplite
Junior ($10, www. BarnesandNoble.com) is a compact, folding book
light you can take just about anywhere. The light clips onto the
back of the book and works well with hardbacks and paperbacks.
You'll also look up-to-the-minute when you use the light: It comes
in a fashionable salmon color with a yellow plastic cover for the
light.

NOT ENOUGH TO MAKE ONE LEAP FOR JOY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE WHITE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's time to break out those festive Leap Day decorations and
party like there's no tomorrow, or like tomorrow is a bonus day,
which it is.
</P>
<P>
   Leap years have been with us since 46 BC, when Julius Caesar
decided to reform the Roman calendar. Caesar's Greek astronomer,
Sosigenes, figured that the Earth takes 365 1/4 days to go around
the sun, which was almost right. In fashioning a new calendar, he
gave every fourth year 366 days, which worked, for a while.
</P>
<P>
   In the eighth century, the Venerable Bede calculated that
Sosigenes's year was 11 minutes and 14 seconds too long. Over the
centuries, the minutes and seconds added up. In 1582, Pope Gregory
XIII noticed that the vernal equinox had slipped backward by about
10 days. He decreed that the day after Oct. 4, 1582, would be Oct.
15 and in one stroke rid the calendar of those 10 troublesome days.
He solved the problem of accumulating days by ordering that only
centennial years evenly divisible by 400 would be considered leap
years, thus abolishing three leap years every 400 years and,
centuries later, tossing a wrench into computer codes all over the
world.
</P>
<P>
   This is the first century leap year since 1600, which accounts
for the tremendous excitement surrounding Leap Day. You can feel it
in the air, no?
</P>
<P>
   Leap Day must be the least commercially exploited occasion on
the calendar. Where are the Leap Day cards? The Leap Day TV
specials? The Leap Day parades?
</P>
<P>
   Almost nobody observes a festive Leap Day except for people who
were born on Feb. 29 and the odd establishment that dares to
feature a Leap Year Ladies' Night, a bow to the old tradition that
allowed women to ask men to marry during Leap Year. No one seems to
know for sure where that custom originated, but it dates back to at
least the 13th century, when it was a matter of Scottish law. The
custom seems quaint in these days of no-holds-barred courting when
many women have no compunctions about asking men to marry, or
whatever.
</P>
<P>
   We could use another February celebration, February being what
it is. If they had to tack an extra day on a month every four
years, why did it have to be February? Why not August? Augustus
Caesar, for whom the eighth month is named, would have approved. He
fiddled with the calendar, stole a day from February, and tacked it
onto August so his month would be as long as July, named for the
original Caesar. Did modesty prevent him from adding another day to
his month? Or did he want to avoid offending the gods?
</P>
<P>
   As old traditions fade, new ones rise to take their place.
Commerce hasn't really neglected Leap Day. Businesses have noticed
that one extra day a year on the calendar means one extra day to
buy stuff. Here is a press release from Best Buy, which
commissioned a survey asking people what they planned to do to
``turn on the fun on Leap Day.'' The survey revealed that the
majority would turn on their fun with technology _ CD players,
stereos, computers, DVDs, and other gadgets that can be purchased
at _ surprise _ Best Buy.
</P>
<P>
   However, the most striking thing about the survey results may be
the proportion of those who responded ``Don't have time for fun
this year'' _ 21 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe Leap Day should be more of a holiday, one on which we
could celebrate the mysteries of time and spare just a little time
for fun.
</P>

   CALIF-POLL (San Francisco) _ Texas Gov. George W. Bush still
holds a double-digit lead over U.S. Sen. John McCain in the
Republican presidential primary, but the Arizona senator is gaining
more GOP converts in the Golden State as the two candidates fight
for the soul of their party, an Examiner/KTVU poll shows. By ROBERT
SALLADAY.
</P>
<P>
   CALIF-BUSH (San Francisco) _ Since he emerged as the
front-runner for the Republican presidential nomination, George W.
Bush has succeeded in milking business groups and other wealthy
donors in the Golden State for a historic haul of campaign
donations, Federal Election Commission records show. By LANCE
WILLIAMS.
</P>
<P>
   CALIF-BRADLEY (San Francisco) _ In an Examiner/KTVU Poll
reported Sunday, former New Jersey Sen. Bill Bradley was trailing
his opponent by more than 20 points in the contest for the
Democratic presidential nomination. But as the March 7 primary
looms, there's one key California constituency that favors former
New Jersey Sen. Bill Bradley over front-runner Al Gore: checkbook
Democrats. By LANCE WILLIAMS.

<P>
   GAY-MARRIAGES (San Francisco) _ Californians' support for
Proposition 22 is unwavering, with just one week left before voters
decide the controversial initiative to bar legal recognition of gay
marriages, according to the latest Examiner/KTVU poll. By CAROL
NESS.
</P>
<P>
   MOLLY-IVINS-BUSH (Undated) _ If there is anyone in journalism
who can make reading about politics a rollicking good time, it's
Molly Ivins, the nationally syndicated columnist from Texas. Yet
Ivins' latest book _ a biography of the man from her home state who
hopes to be president _ isn't all that funny. By JOAN SMITH.
</P>
<P>
   RACIAL-SLURS (San Francisco) _ The ``N-word`` and other blatant
ethnic slurs are rarely heard in public discourse. But when they
are _ as in the recent case of GOP presidential hopeful Sen. John
McCain's use of the slur ``gook`` _ the public outcry they provoke
is a reminder of their undiminished force. By ANNIE NAKAO.

   VOICE-RECOGNITION (San Francisco) _ Thanks to amazing
improvements in ``speech recognition`` technology, you can buy a
plane ticket or check a stock price without talking to a living
soul. Simply dial the right number and converse with a

20-year-old Hewlett-Packard 12C and you're playing with fire. Now
the chairman and chief executive officer of the Shorenstein Co.,
among the nation's largest and oldest privately held real estate

   OUTDOORS-COLUMN (San Francisco) _ The rod tip twitched only a
quarter of an inch. At the other end, it turned out, nibbling at
the ghost shrimp for bait, was the biggest fish caught in Northern
California in 15 years. It was a sturgeon, 9-feet-4 inches long
with a 56-inch girth, an estimated 450 pounds, landed and released
after a 3-hour, 45-minute fight with five anglers passing the rod _
that even attracted a sheriff's patrol boat to watch the action. By

   MORSE-COLUMN (San Francisco) _ My mother and I never talked
politics. She was the smart one in the family, the one with sense,
both common and uncommon. Whenever the subject of politics came up
in phone conversations, she hung up her extension and let my father
and I solve the world's problems. Alice Cooper Morse was the

  FEEL-GOOD STYLE MAY NOT PAY OFF    By L.M. SIXEL  c. 2000 Houston
Chronicle   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Companies like to tout their touchy-feely sensitivity,
but evidence has surfaced that innovative employment practices
don't necessarily benefit the bottom line.
</P>
<P>
   Companies, for example, have rushed to put programs into place
that turn managers into coaches and mentors. But Watson Wyatt
Worldwide, the human resources consulting firm, says this new
management approach doesn't have much impact on a company's market
value and, consequently, on shareholder return.
</P>
<P>
   Neither does conducting an employee opinion survey, said Ann
Venier, an account manager with Watson Wyatt in Houston. The Watson
Wyatt study that led to that conclusion looked at 405 companies.
</P>
<P>
   The results surprised William R. Bufkins, director of special
projects, including human resources, for Spacehab in Houston.
Surveys can be helpful in keeping in touch with what is going on in
an organization, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the people surveyed were responding to questionnaires
that weren't well-designed or were too superficial, Bufkins said.
Or perhaps the companies didnove its performance.
</P>
<P>
   Nice perks and a company being on top-employer lists also
attract top workers, said Kathleen M. Fenninger, senior director of
human resources for Enron Corp. It got 1,500 resumes the day after
Fortune put Enron on its list of America's most-admired companies.
</P>
<P>
   But it all boils down to creating a workplace in which employees
feel they're learning and being challenged in a cutting-edge
environment, said Fenninger.

<P>
   No science-fiction novel is complete without an appearance of
the universal thing-maker. Whether it's called a fabricator, a
replicator or a Mark-12 Hyperduplicator, the basic idea is always
the same: a gadget that miraculously creates or copies any object
the protagonist desires.
</P>
<P>
   The fictional thing-maker may be an abused plot device, but a
real one, linked to the Internet and nestled between the microwave
and the blender, would be the most exciting domestic appliance
ever. Need a comb, a Ken doll, an exhaust manifold for a 1967 Ford
Fairlane? Download it.
</P>
<P>
   This fantasy is not as farfetched as it sounds. Three-D printers
_ known in the industrial world as solid-imaging machines _ are
already here in nascent form, transforming the way products are
designed.
</P>
<P>
   Once the first home models arrive, in a decade or so, consumer
culture may never be the same.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your children's children will print their own toys,'' predicts
Mervyn Rudgley, senior director of business development for 3D
Systems of Valencia, Calif., the first and largest company in the
field.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Hull, founder of 3D Systems, expects the technology will
eventually lead to the ultimate in online shopping: goods delivered
directly into the customer's living room.
</P>
<P>
   Hull cooked up the first solid-imaging system in 1984 in a
back-room lab while working for a company in San Gabriel, Calif.,
that made ultraviolet lamps. Some of the lamps were used to treat
special coatings that harden when exposed to ultraviolet light.
</P>
<P>
   By extending the process, Hull realized, he could make solid
objects from light-cured plastics.
</P>
<P>
   Laboring long nights and weekends, he finally persuaded a
computer-guided light beam to dance in a precise pattern on the
surface of a basin full of gooey polymer.
</P>
<P>
   After the jittering beam solidified a thin layer of plastic, a
platform just below the surface dropped a fraction of a millimeter,
submerging the layer under another coat of polymer, and the
procedure repeated itself.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, with the topmost layer hardened, the platform rose
dramatically, revealing Hull's first creation: a translucent,
bluish, inch-tall cup.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's crude,'' he says, ``but it showed what was possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Hull dubbed the process stereolithography, meaning roughly
``printing in three dimensions.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I had the sense right from the start that this would be a big
industry. With this, any shape you could design with a CAD
(computer-aided design) program, you could make.''
</P>
<P>
   When Hull unveiled his machine at a Detroit engineering show in
1987, designers snapped it up. Compared with traditional
prototyping, which required artisans to carve wood, sculpt clay or
machine steel, stereolithography seemed miraculous. It could
translate a computer model of a camshaft or valve stem into a 3-D
prototype in hours rather than weeks.
</P>
<P>
   And a team in Tokyo could electronically send that model to a
stereolithography machine in Tennessee, where collaborators could
inspect a physical prototype and zap back instructions for
revisions.
</P>
<P>
   Soon, designers from dozens of industries began quickcrafting
concept models of heart valves, dinnerware, drainpipes, dentures,
lightbulbs _ almost any object imaginable. Virtually every home in
America now contains products prototyped by stereolithography
machines.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you shorten prototyping time so dramatically, you can
keep changing and improving the design much more quickly,'' says
Rudgley, who estimates more than 5,000 solid-imaging machines are
cranking away worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   Solid imaging also permits 3-D copying. At a Los Angeles
computer-graphics show last summer, more than 700 people poked
their heads into a laser-scanner linked to a solid-imaging machine.
Each person was rewarded with a small glimpse at the future: a
2-inch-tall, micromillimeter-accurate sculpture of his or her face.
</P>
<P>
   The copied object need not even be visible to the eye. Working
with a solid-imaging machine and a CT scanner, researchers examined
and replicated a mummy's skull in the National Museum of
Antiquities in the Netherlands without unwrapping a single bandage.
</P>
<P>
   Several manufacturers of medical implants use solid imaging to
model X-rays of diseased bones and to create accurate molds for
casting replacements such as artificial hip joints.
</P>
<P>
   Applications that seem exotic today will become routine, as
solid imaging grows rapidly cheaper and more versatile. A decade
ago, the first stereolithography machines cost around $300,000 and
could build only plastic objects. Today there are more than a
half-dozen related technologies, some of which are far more
economical.
</P>
<P>
   Ink-jet solid imaging is the new cost leader. Your household
solid-imaging machine, whenever it arrives, will likely use this
approach.
</P>
<P>
   Sanders Prototype Inc., in Merrimack, N.H., sells $65,000 units
the size of a two-drawer file cabinet. A pair of heads, similar to
the ones in standard ink-jet printers, zips back and forth around a
platform, spitting out 6,000 microdots of hot plastic per second.
</P>
<P>
   Each pass of the heads adds another layer of plastic, building
up a 3-D object.
</P>
<P>
   Ink-jet imaging is slow but precise, perfect for modeling small,
finely drawn objects.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jewelers love them,'' says Sanders CEO David Bothwell. ``They
use them to make the actual wax `positives' used to make casting
molds.''
</P>
<P>
   Engineers are feverishly pushing the technology beyond plastic
so that solid imaging can be used to build finished products, not
just prototypes. Devices that can custom-create objects from metal,
paper, ceramics and composites are either in production or close to
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're right at the very beginning,'' Bothwell says.
</P>
<P>
   Give the solid-imaging pioneers a few more years of tinkering,
and that Hyperduplicator might not look like such a silly plot
device after all. &QL;

<P>
   &UR; KEYS TO LOW STRESS &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As professor of ergonomics at Cornell University, Alan Hedge has
investigated a lot of failed attempts to find a less stressful way
to type.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the keyboards that claim to be ergonomic really do
diddly-squat,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   But the vertical split-keyboard, made by Ergonomic-Interface
Keyboard Systems in La Jolla, Calif., is different. Hedge's tests
suggest that the accordionlike keyboard does reduce the risk of
developing carpal tunnel syndrome.
</P>
<P>
   Horizontal keyboards, the norm since the invention of the
typewriter in the 1860s, force typists to twist their wrists
downward, thus compressing the tunnel through which the nerves in
the forearm pass.
</P>
<P>
   That pressure sometimes triggers carpal tunnel syndrome, a
painful condition that, if left untreated, can lead to loss of
sensation and use of the hands.
</P>
<P>
   The vertical split-keyboard, with keys facing outward, places
the wrists in a more neutral, untwisted position.
</P>
<P>
   In trials on 12 touch typists, Hedge found that the split
keyboard kept wrists in a low-stress position more than 75 percent
of the time, as compared to less than 50 percent for conventional
keyboards.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the vertical keyboard, you're virtually never in a
high-risk position,'' Hedge says.
</P>
<P>
   Right now the vertical split-keyboard exists only in prototype
form. According to its creator, Jeffrey Spencer of
Ergonomic-Interface, the improved design could actually be holding
it back.
</P>
<P>
   Conventional-keyboard manufacturers, facing lawsuits by injured
office workers, may be leery of licensing a technology that implies
their past products were deficient.

<P>
   At IBM's Zurich Research Laboratory, James Gimzewski plays with
molecules as freely as a child plays with blocks.
</P>
<P>
   By manipulating a tiny, electrically charged stylus, Gimzewski
has built an abacus of carbon molecules one ten-millionth of an
inch wide. He's now working on a variety of other molecular
contraptions, including a tiny rotor that spins using the heat
energy around it.
</P>
<P>
   These devices are the first steps toward a new kind of
micro-industry, constructed molecule by molecule.

   &UR; Q: &LR;  What's the use of such tiny machines?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A: &LR;  If you tried to make one engine on a nanometer (billionth
of a meter) scale, you could ask, ``What good is it?'' You can't
put it in a tractor. But if you made a trillion of them, you could
do all kinds of things: Drop them on a field and they could plow it
or aerate the soil.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q: &LR;  How would you fuel those engines?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A: &LR;  You want to use something like ATP, the energy-carrying
chemical in biology. Then strange ideas like miniature medical
submarines going through the human body and fixing problems are
maybe not so ridiculous after all. You could use chemicals in the
body to operate the motor and control which way the sub turns.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q: &LR;  You work at IBM _ what's the computer connection?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A: &LR;  For computers, small is beautiful. In 10 to 20 years, the
way we make chips will reach its limits. So there is an interest in
anything on the nanometer scale.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q: &LR;  When will we see useful molecular machines?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A: &LR;  Ten years is reasonable. Not next year, that's for sure.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q: &LR;  What inspired you to become a scientist?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A: &LR;  In school, I was always best in science and art. Actually,
I wanted to be a painter. But when I got to high school, they said
you have to do science, because art is not something you're going
to make a profession out of. Eventually, I realized science and art
are the same anyway. The artist has a paintbrush, and I have a
tunneling microscope and a computer, but the creativity is the
same.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q: &LR;  If you could use molecular technology to redesign yourself,
what would you change?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A: &LR;  I'd like to have X-ray vision eyes to see through walls.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q: &LR;  What's the biggest problem in the world today?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A: &LR;  It is people's fear of themselves and others.
Nanotechnology could help solve that. I dream of the day when
technology is invisible and people can communicate with each other
over distances without mobile phones and so on. I think that would
change our society very much.

 &UR; THE ICE MAN HEALETH &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   These days, tattoos are bold fashion statements, but what
purpose did they serve 5,000 years ago?
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps a medicinal one, says Max Moser, a physiologist at the
University of Graz in Austria. He and his colleague, Leopold
Dorfer, reached this conclusion after examining Otzi, the mummified
ice man extracted from a glacier in the Alps in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Otzi's back, right knee and left ankle were adorned with 15
groups of short, bluish-black tattooed lines, probably made by
injecting ash beneath the skin with a bone or wooden needle.
</P>
<P>
   The locations of the tattoos closely match those of traditional
acupuncture points used to treat backache and stomach upset.
</P>
<P>
   Significantly, X-rays of Otzi's body indicate that the
middle-aged man had arthritis of the hip joints, knees, ankles and
spine. Forensic analysis also reveals that the ice man's intestines
were rife with whipworm eggs.
</P>
<P>
   Otzi lived some 2,000 years before the oldest generally
recognized evidence of acupuncture, which raises questions about
whether the practice originated in Europe, not China.
</P>
<P>
   Moser thinks the history of acupuncture may be even more
complicated: ``At the time when Otzi was around, I'm sure that many
shamanistic cultures worldwide might have practiced it. But only
the Chinese formalized it and saved it into modern times.''

   Industrial robots are too clumsy to help with household chores
like cooking, but Shigeki Sugano and his colleagues at Waseda
University in Tokyo built WENDY for high-dexterity tasks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Humans change the pose of their fingertips to adjust their
force on objects. The nails generate high pressure,'' Sugano says.
</P>
<P>
   WENDY'S fingers have a hard core surrounded by soft rubber pads
and a rigid ``nail'' on top. The robot can modify how much force it
applies by changing the angles of its joints. The system is so
refined that WENDY can crack open an egg into a frying pan.

   &UR; KEYS TO LOW STRESS &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As professor of ergonomics at Cornell University, Alan Hedge has
investigated a lot of failed attempts to find a less stressful way
to type.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the keyboards that claim to be ergonomic really do
diddly-squat,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   But the vertical split-keyboard, made by Ergonomic-Interface
Keyboard Systems in La Jolla, Calif., is different. Hedge's tests
suggest that the accordionlike keyboard does reduce the risk of
developing carpal tunnel syndrome.
</P>
<P>
   Horizontal keyboards, the norm since the invention of the
typewriter in the 1860s, force typists to twist their wrists
downward, thus compressing the tunnel through which the nerves in
the forearm pass.
</P>
<P>
   That pressure sometimes triggers carpal tunnel syndrome, a
painful condition that, if left untreated, can lead to loss of
sensation and use of the hands.
</P>
<P>
   The vertical split-keyboard, with keys facing outward, places
the wrists in a more neutral, untwisted position.
</P>
<P>
   In trials on 12 touch typists, Hedge found that the split
keyboard kept wrists in a low-stress position more than 75 percent
of the time, as compared to less than 50 percent for conventional
keyboards.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the vertical keyboard, you're virtually never in a
high-risk position,'' Hedge says.
</P>
<P>
   Right now the vertical split-keyboard exists only in prototype
form. According to its creator, Jeffrey Spencer of
Ergonomic-Interface, the improved design could actually be holding
it back.
</P>
<P>
   Conventional-keyboard manufacturers, facing lawsuits by injured
office workers, may be leery of licensing a technology that implies
their past products were deficient.
</P>

 &UR; MOLECULE MOVER AND SHAKER &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   At IBM's Zurich Research Laboratory, James Gimzewski plays with
molecules as freely as a child plays with blocks.
</P>
<P>
   By manipulating a tiny, electrically charged stylus, Gimzewski
has built an abacus of carbon molecules one ten-millionth of an
inch wide. He's now working on a variety of other molecular
contraptions, including a tiny rotor that spins using the heat
energy around it.
</P>
<P>
   These devices are the first steps toward a new kind of
micro-industry, constructed molecule by molecule.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q: &LR;  What's the use of such tiny machines?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A: &LR;  If you tried to make one engine on a nanometer (billionth
of a meter) scale, you could ask, ``What good is it?'' You can't
put it in a tractor. But if you made a trillion of them, you could

<P>
   No science-fiction novel is complete without an appearance of
the universal thing-maker. Whether it's called a fabricator, a
replicator or a Mark-12 Hyperduplicator, the basic idea is always
the same: a gadget that miraculously creates or copies any object
the protagonist desires.
</P>
<P>
   The fictional thing-maker may be an abused plot device, but a
real one, linked to the Internet and nestled between the microwave
and the blender, would be the most exciting domestic appliance
ever. Need a comb, a Ken doll, an exhaust manifold for a 1967 Ford
Fairlane? Download it.
</P>
<P>
   This fantasy is not as farfetched as it sounds. Three-D printers
_ known in the industrial world as solid-imaging machines _ are
already here in nascent form, transforming the way products are
designed.
</P>
<P>
   Once the first home models arrive, in a decade or so, consumer
culture may never be the same.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your children's children will print their own toys,'' predicts
Mervyn Rudgley, senior director of business development for 3D
Systems of Valencia, Calif., the first and largest company in the
field.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Hull, founder of 3D Systems, expects the technology will
eventually lead to the ultimate in online shopping: goods delivered
directly into the customer's living room.
</P>
<P>
   Hull cooked up the first solid-imaging system in 1984 in a
back-room lab while working for a company in San Gabriel, Calif.,
that made ultraviolet lamps. Some of the lamps were used to treat
special coatings that harden when exposed to ultraviolet light.
</P>
<P>
   By extending the process, Hull realized, he could make solid
objects from light-cured plastics.
</P>
<P>
   Laboring long nights and weekends, he finally persuaded a
computer-guided light beam to dance in a precise pattern on the
surface of a basin full of gooey polymer.
</P>
<P>
   After the jittering beam solidified a thin layer of plastic, a
platform just below the surface dropped a fraction of a millimeter,
submerging the layer under another coat of polymer, and the
procedure repeated itself.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, with the topmost layer hardened, the platform rose
dramatically, revealing Hull's first creation: a translucent,
bluish, inch-tall cup.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's crude,'' he says, ``but it showed what was possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Hull dubbed the process stereolithography, meaning roughly
``printing in three dimensions.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I had the sense right from the start that this would be a big
industry. With this, any shape you could design with a CAD
(computer-aided design) program, you could make.''
</P>
<P>
   When Hull unveiled his machine at a Detroit engineering show in
1987, designers snapped it up. Compared with traditional
prototyping, which required artisans to carve wood, sculpt clay or
machine steel, stereolithography seemed miraculous. It could
translate a computer model of a camshaft or valve stem into a 3-D
prototype in hours rather than weeks.
</P>
<P>
   team in Tokyo could electronically send that model to a
stereolithography machine in Tennessee, where collaborators could
inspect a physical prototype and zap back instructions for
revisions.
</P>
<P>
   Soon, designers from dozens of industries began quickcrafting
concept models of heart valves, dinnerware, drainpipes, dentures,
lightbulbs _ almost any object imaginable. Virtually every home in
America now contains products prototyped by stereolithography
machines.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you shorten prototyping time so dramatically, you can
keep changing and improving the design much more quickly,'' says
Rudgley, who estimates more than 5,000 solid-imaging machines are
cranking away worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   Solid imaging also permits 3-D copying. At a Los Angeles
computer-graphics show last summer, more than 700 people poked
their heads into a laser-scanner linked to a solid-imaging machine.
Each person was rewarded with a small glimpse at the future: a
2-inch-tall, micromillimeter-accurate sculpture of his or her face.
</P>
<P>
   The copied object need not even be visible to the eye. Working
with a solid-imaging machine and a CT scanner, researchers examined
and replicated a mummy's skull in the National Museum of
Antiquities in the Netherlands without unwrapping a single bandage.
</P>
<P>
   Several manufacturers of medical implants use solid imaging to
model X-rays of diseased bones and to create accurate molds for
casting replacements such as artificial hip joints.
</P>
<P>
   Applications that seem exotic today will become routine, as
solid imaging grows rapidly cheaper and more versatile. A decade
ago, the first stereolithography machines cost around $300,000 and
could build only plastic objects. Today there are more than a
half-dozen related technologies, some of which are far more
economical.
</P>
<P>
   Ink-jet solid imaging is the new cost leader. Your household
solid-imaging machine, whenever it arrives, will likely use this
approach.
</P>
<P>
   Sanders Prototype Inc., in Merrimack, N.H., sells $65,000 units
the size of a two-drawer file cabinet. A pair of heads, similar to
the ones in standard ink-jet printers, zips back and forth around a
platform, spitting out 6,000 microdots of hot plastic per second.
</P>
<P>
   Each pass of the heads adds another layer of plastic, building
up a 3-D object.
</P>
<P>
   Ink-jet imaging is slow but precise, perfect for modeling small,
finely drawn objects.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jewelers love them,'' says Sanders CEO David Bothwell. ``They
use them to make the actual wax `positives' used to make casting
molds.''
</P>
<P>
   Engineers are feverishly pushing the technology beyond plastic
so that solid imaging can be used to build finished products, not
just prototypes. Devices that can custom-create objects from metal,
paper, ceramics and composites are either in production or close to
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're right at the very beginning,'' Bothwell says.
</P>
<P>
   Give the solid-imaging pioneers a few more years of tinkering,
and that Hyperduplicator might not look like such a silly plot
device after all. &QL;

Antiquities in the Netherlands without unwrapping a single bandage.
</P>
<P>
   Several manufacturers of medical implants use solid imaging to
model X-rays of diseased bones and to create accurate molds for
casting replacements such as artificial hip joints.
</P>
<P>
   Applications that seem exotic today will become routine, as
solid imaging grows rapidly cheaper and more versatile. A decade
ago, the first stereolithography machines cost around $300,000 and
could build only plastic objects. Today there are more than a
half-dozen related technologies, some of which are far more
economical.
</P>
<P>
   Ink-jet solid imaging is the new cost leader. Your household
solid-imaging machine, whenever it arrives, will likely use this
approach.
</P>
<P>
   Sanders Prototype Inc., in Merrimack, N.H., sells $65,000 units
the size of a two-drawer file cabinet. A pair of heads, similar to
the ones in standard ink-jet printers, zips back and forth around a
platform, spitting out 6,000 microdots of hot plastic per second.
</P>
<P>
   Each pass of the heads adds another layer of plastic, building
up a 3-D object.
</P>
<P>
   Ink-jet imaging is slow but precise, perfect for modeling small,
finely drawn objects.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jewelers love them,'' says Sanders CEO David Bothwell. ``They
use them to make the actual wax `positives' used to make casting
molds.''
</P>
<P>
   Engineers are feverishly pushing the technology beyond plastic
so that solid imaging can be used to build finished products, not
just prototypes. Devices that can custom-create objects from metal,
paper, ceramics and composites are either in production or close to
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're right at the very beginning,'' Bothwell says.
</P>
<P>
   Give the solid-imaging pioneers a few more years of tinkering,
and that Hyperduplicator might not look like such a silly plot
device after all. &QL;

   &UR; KEYS TO LOW STRESS &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As professor of ergonomics at Cornell University, Alan Hedge has
investigated a lot of failed attempts to find a less stressful way
to type.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the keyboards that claim to be ergonomic really do
diddly-squat,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   But the vertical split-keyboard, made by Ergonomic-Interface
Keyboard Systems in La Jolla, Calif., is different. Hedge's tests
suggest that the accordionlike keyboard does reduce the risk of
developing carpal tunnel syndrome.
</P>
<P>
   Horizontal keyboards, the norm since the invention of the
typewriter in the 1860s, force typists to twist their wrists
downward, thus compressing the tunnel through which the nerves in
the forearm pass.
</P>
<P>
   That pressure sometimes triggers carpal tunnel syndrome, a
painful condition that, if left untreated, can lead to loss of
sensation and use of the hands.
</P>
<P>
   The vertical split-keyboard, with keys facing outward, places
the wrists in a more neutral, untwisted position.
</P>
<P>
   In trials on 12 touch typists, Hedge found that the split
keyboard kept wrists in a low-stress position more than 75 percent
of the time, as compared to less than 50 percent for conventional
keyboards.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the vertical keyboard, you're virtually never in a
high-risk position,'' Hedge says.
</P>
<P>
   Right now the vertical split-keyboard exists only in prototype
form. According to its creator, Jeffrey Spencer of
Ergonomic-Interface, the improved design could actually be holding
it back.
</P>
<P>
   Conventional-keyboard manufacturers, facing lawsuits by injured
office workers, may be leery of licensing a technology that implies
their past products were deficient.

 &UR; MOLECULE MOVER AND SHAKER &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   At IBM's Zurich Research Laboratory, James Gimzewski plays with
molecules as freely as a child plays with blocks.
</P>
<P>
   By manipulating a tiny, electrically charged stylus, Gimzewski
has built an abacus of carbon molecules one ten-millionth of an
inch wide. He's now working on a variety of other molecular
contraptions, including a tiny rotor that spins using the heat
energy around it.
</P>
<P>
   These devices are the first steps toward a new kind of
micro-industry, constructed molecule by molecule.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q: &LR;  What's the use of such tiny machines?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A: &LR;  If you tried to make one engine on a nanometer (billionth
of a meter) scale, you could ask, ``What good is it?'' You can't
put it in a tractor. But if you made a trillion of them, you could
do all kinds of things: Drop them on a field and they could plow it
or aerate the soil.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q: &LR;  How would you fuel those engines?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A: &LR;  You want to use something like ATP, the energy-carrying
chemical in biology. Then strange ideas like miniature medical
submarines going through the human body and fixing problems are
maybe not so ridiculous after all. You could use chemicals in the
body to operate the motor and control which way the sub turns.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q: &LR;  You work at IBM _ what's the computer connection?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A: &LR;  For computers, small is beautiful. In 10 to 20 years, the
way we make chips will reach its limits. So there is an interest in
anything on the nanometer scale.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q: &LR;  When will we see useful molecular machines?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A: &LR;  Ten years is reasonable. Not next year, that's for sure.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q: &LR;  What inspired you to become a scientist?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A: &LR;  In school, I was always best in science and art. Actually,
I wanted to be a painter. But when I got to high school, they said
you have to do science, because art is not something you're going
to make a profession out of. Eventually, I realized science and art
are the same anyway. The artist has a paintbrush, and I have a
tunneling microscope and a computer, but the creativity is the
same.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q: &LR;  If you could use molecular technology to redesign yourself,
what would you change?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A: &LR;  I'd like to have X-ray vision eyes to see through walls.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q: &LR;  What's the biggest problem in the world today?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A: &LR;  It is people's fear of themselves and others.
Nanotechnology could help solve that. I dream of the day when
technology is invisible and people can communicate with each other
over distances without mobile phones and so on. I think that would
change our society very much.

 &UR; THE ICE MAN HEALETH &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   These days, tattoos are bold fashion statements, but what
purpose did they serve 5,000 years ago?
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps a medicinal one, says Max Moser, a physiologist at the
University of Graz in Austria. He and his colleague, Leopold
Dorfer, reached this conclusion after examining Otzi, the mummified
ice man extracted from a glacier in the Alps in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Otzi's back, right knee and left ankle were adorned with 15
groups of short, bluish-black tattooed lines, probably made by
injecting ash beneath the skin with a bone or wooden needle.
</P>
<P>
   The locations of the tattoos closely match those of traditional
acupuncture points used to treat backache and stomach upset.
</P>
<P>
   Significantly, X-rays of Otzi's body indicate that the
middle-aged man had arthritis of the hip joints, knees, ankles and
spine. Forensic analysis also reveals that the ice man's intestines
were rife with whipworm eggs.
</P>
<P>
   Otzi lived some 2,000 years before the oldest generally
recognized evidence of acupuncture, which raises questions about
whether the practice originated in Europe, not China.
</P>
<P>
   Moser thinks the history of acupuncture may be even more
complicated: ``At the time when Otzi was around, I'm sure that many
shamanistic cultures worldwide might have practiced it. But only
the Chinese formalized it and saved it into modern times.''
</P>
<P>
   -----
 &UR; COGS IN THE KITCHEN &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Industrial robots are too clumsy to help with household chores
like cooking, but Shigeki Sugano and his colleagues at Waseda
University in Tokyo built WENDY for high-dexterity tasks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Humans change the pose of their fingertips to adjust their
force on objects. The nails generate high pressure,'' Sugano says.
</P>
<P>
   WENDY'S fingers have a hard core surrounded by soft rubber pads
and a rigid ``nail'' on top. The robot can modify how much force it
applies by changing the angles of its joints. The system is so
refined that WENDY can crack open an egg into a frying pan.
</P>
<P>
   Sugano plans to add systems that respond to voice commands,
thereby moving his robot even closer toward becoming a useful
domestic assistant.

GOP'S TENT FLAP MAY BE CLOSED TO SOME AFTER ALL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By O. RICARDO PIMENTEL  
 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - What do `gooks,` Bob Jones University and the
Confederate flag have in common?
</P>
<P>
   Easy. An early indication that the GOP big tent is perhaps not
as spacious as one might hope.
</P>
<P>
   Let's start with `gooks.`
</P>
<P>
   In a 1973 interview with `U.S. News and World Report,` future
Arizona Sen. John McCain used the word liberally, according to
press accounts.
</P>
<P>
   There's context. Five years as a prisoner of war in North
Vietnam will tend to cause some bitterness. So, though it wasn't
good judgment to use the word even then, we can understand the
feelings that the brutality of his captors might have produced.
</P>
<P>
   Fast forward to 1999. McCain, now a contender for the Republican
presidential nomination, still used the word while talking to
reporters on his ``Straight Talk Express.'' Others picked it up,
and the Senator has been scrambling this week to recoup, explaining
how brutally he and his fellow POWs were treated by their captors.
</P>
<P>
   Sorry, but if they were the senator's target, he used the wrong
weapon. `Gook` is an H-bomb word, loaded with offense no matter how
it's used. So, as they say in the military, there is now plenty of
collateral damage. This was no surgical strike. There are civilian
casualties aplenty. Heck, I'm not even Asian-American and I'm
angry.
</P>
<P>
   And that's because this is a word that, no matter how it's used,
tars an entire group.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, the senator apologized, renounced offensive language
and said he would no longer use the word. Good, but there is
something else, besides remorse, we value highly in a president:
judgment.
</P>
<P>
   John F. Kennedy had a boat blown out from under him during World
War II and suffered a serious, lifelong back injury as a result.
George Bush, the elder, got his World War II Navy plane shot down.
I don't recall either one of them using the word `Jap` in public,
though they, too, probably had bitter memories from war.
</P>
<P>
   No, they had the good sense to recognize epithets.
</P>
<P>
   McCain is now a presidential candidate, and a lot of us would
have preferred he had the same good sense. His use of the word,
unfortunately, says something about him and his presidential
timber. Straight talk, OK. But if the straight talk is racist, what
does that say?
</P>
<P>
   On to Bob Jones University in Columbia, S.C., where other
presidential candidates have made appearances in the past. George
W. Bush was there earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
   This is no ordinary university. It lost its tax-exempt status in
the '70s because it wouldn't admit Black students. At the time, it
also forbade interracial dating. It now admits Blacks but still
doesn't allow interracial dating.
</P>
<P>
   There's more. The Christian fundamentalist university has
espoused anti-Catholic views. The school's Web site has attacked
Catholicism as a ``cult.''
</P>
<P>
   Bob Jones Jr., the son and school chancelor in 1982, had this to
say: ``The pope is the greatest danger we face today. He's doing
more to spread anti-Christ communism than anyone around. The papacy
is the religion of the Antichrist and is a satanic system.''
</P>
<P>
   Bob Jones, the father, said that God created the races to be
separate from one another.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has been backtracking ever since. He says he's not
anti-anything, has a Catholic (his brother Jeb) in the family and
that his appearance did not signal he accepts the school's tenets.
Instead, he was trying to sell it on his.
</P>
<P>
   OK, but his appearance gives the school, and by extension its
views, legitimacy. If the governor had used the opportunity to make
a major address against racism and for religious tolerance, that
would be one thing. He didn't. It was a stump speech.
</P>
<P>
   It's all very simple. He needed the social conservatives for
that South Carolina win. The word for that is `pandering.`
</P>
<P>
   So now I'm left wondering precisely where is the compassionate
part of that compassionate conservatism of his?
</P>
<P>
   Which brings us to the Confederate flag, still flying proudly
over the state capitol in South Carolina. And that, according to
Bush and McCain, is just fine with them.
</P>
<P>
   This too is simple. That flag, flown in a war the South waged
partly to preserve the evil known as slavery, is a symbol of
hatred. Both candidates should have said so. They didn't. Decency
demanded they should have. Unfortunately, politics often trumps
decency. (Note to Gov. Bush: The flag doesn't belong over any
public building in Texas either).
</P>
<P>
   So, what about this GOP Big Tent? Well, so far the two leading
contenders for ringmaster are telling me that what they have in
mind for me and people like me is the back row.

gooder'' organizations once in a while, but I'll wager few folks
are as inundated as we are.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do gooder'' is a pejorative tag. I prefer ``charitable.'' But
it is proof that everybody in the money-seeking trade _ for-profit,
nonprofit or what have you _ swaps sucker lists.
</P>
<P>
   We're swimming in these little gifts because we support, in a
very modest way, certain well-intentioned and beneficial groups.
Just a small donation here and there in the hope that it'll further
the good work we have heard they do. Those we support respond with
thanks and a new supply of labels; they also must alert every
organization with any charitable connection that here's a live one.
</P>
<P>
   In case you'd like to amass your own supply of labels, here is a
list of the ones we have crammed into a large plastic bag: National
Foundation for Cancer Research, Teach Tolerance, Southern Poverty
Law Center, Habitat For Humanity, Paralyzed Veterans of America,
Cystic Fibrosis Foundation, National Wildlife Federation, World
Wildlife Federation, Wildlife Land Trust, Marine Mammal Center,
Defenders of Wildlife, World Wildlife Fund, Shriners Hospital,
American Diabetes Association, Doctors Without Borders, American
Bible Society, Rainforest Action Network, Wilderness Society,
American Cancer Society, National Parks Trust, National Parks and
Conservation Association, Center for Marine Conservation, USO,
National Audubon Society and seven others who don't have their
names on the labels, just ours.
</P>
<P>
   Also, we don't have just one batch from each. Some, especially
the wildlife-related groups, send a new offering every few months.
</P>
<P>
   Mind you, we don't donate to all these groups; if we did, we
couldn't afford to eat. We support perhaps six or seven,
intermittently.
</P>
<P>
   Choice of the labels we actually use depends on the design and
whether they are for either one or both of us. The flow swells
around Christmastime, with all sorts of seasonal designs. This
makes them useful for addressing greeting cards, but eliminates
them from the active list for the rest of the year.
</P>
<P>
   So here are a couple of suggestions for you label-sending
organizations. Not that we will cough up additional contributions,
but we might use your labels over others. Hence, they'll be seen by
more people who might send you a buck or two and then you can put
them on your mailing list:
</P>
<P>
   _ Make your label attractive but not garish.
</P>
<P>
   _ If you have to include your name, make it unobtrusive.
</P>
<P>
   _ Go easy on the Christmas motif; it has a short shelf life.
</P>
<P>
   _ If possible, make your label a bit larger than the standard
5/8 x 2 1/8.
</P>
<P>
   _ Don't send too many. Thirty or so at a time is enough.

 &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By STEPHANIE SALTER

<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ the bride wants an annulment, the groom was once
slapped with a restraining order and the prospect for a second or
third installment is zero, ``Who Wants To Marry a
Multimillionaire?'' is a genie escaped from its bottle.
</P>
<P>
   After all, some 14 million people tuned in to Fox TV in early
February to watch 50 women parade in front of an alleged
multimillionaire, who then picked one dame and married her in an
on-air civil ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   Millions more folks have made red-hot properties of the three
new ``greed shows,'' including ``Who Wants To Be a Millionaire?''
And they've spawned several ``reality'' game competitions, such as
a ``Lord of the Flies'' show called ``Survival.''
</P>
<P>
   Who can possibly believe that good taste, restraint or (please)
morality will win out over the prospect of 14 million viewers? How
hard is it to imagine the following in the old cable TV creative
pipeline right now:
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Who Wants To Be a Hooker?,'' followed by ``Who Wants To Be a
Pimp?'' (Wednesdays, 8 and 8:30 p.m., E!).
</P>
<P>
   Hosted by Randy Thornhill and Craig T. Palmer, authors of ``A
Natural History of Rape: Biological Bases of Sexual Coercion,''
this double bill is broadcast live each week from a different
Nevada brothel. (Like gambling, prostitution is legal in Nevada.)
</P>
<P>
   To qualify as a contestant, wannabe hookers must establish their
amateur status by proving they have never taken actual money in
exchange for sex. Responsible for their own make-up, clothing and
line of dirty talk, they audition before a co-ed panel of real
madames and ``frequent-flyer'' johns.
</P>
<P>
   The winner gets her own room for a night at the brothel with a
full load of clients and lunch with Hugh Grant.
</P>
<P>
   At 8:30, the tables turn and a panel of veteran prostitutes
selects the one man who manages to persuade them to give him most
of their earnings. (No on-air drug use or physical violence
permitted.) Mr. Pimp-for-a-Night gets to choose three regular
employees of the brothel, keep 75 percent of whatever they are paid
for a month, and drive off in a pre-owned but mint-condition, gold
Mercedes Benz.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Who Wants To (Bleep) Tonya Harding?'' (Saturdays, 4 p.m.,
ESPN2).
</P>
<P>
   Drawing from the rapidly growing pool of people who have found
themselves on the receiving end of the troubled figure skater's
ire, contestants for this show can be male or female.
</P>
<P>
   The star-studded premiere is hosted by Nancy Kerrigan, Harding's
ex-husband, Jeff Gillooly, and recent beau, Darren Silver.
</P>
<P>
   Unique to this competition, contestants need only show up and
explain why they want to (bleep) Tonya Harding to win the
opportunity to do so.
</P>
<P>
   And it's up to each of them to define just what ``bleep'' means.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Who Wants To Be an Executioner?'' (Sundays, 11:30 p.m.,
Court TV).
</P>
<P>
   Working in conjunction with the corrections departments of every
state that has capital punishment, this show's producers match
death row inmates _ whose appeals are exhausted _ with ordinary
citizens who harbor fantasies of murder.
</P>
<P>
   The governors Bush _ George W. of Texas and Jeb of Florida _
alternate as hosts, providing a detailed review of the doomed
inmate's crime and a tour of the specific gas chamber, gallows,
electric chair or lethal injection room in which he/she will die.
</P>
<P>
   Contestants, who have the option of appearing with a black hood,
get three minutes to convince the judges that they deserve to pull
the switch, even though they're not personally connected to the
killer or any victim(s).
</P>
<P>
   Composition of the panel varies from venue to venue but always
includes six maximum-security prison guards, three wardens and a
pro-death penalty politician up for reelection.
</P>
<P>
   The winning executioner collects his/her prize at 12:05 a.m.,
immediately after the show, and takes home a souvenir video.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Who Wants To Be Lolita?'' (Fridays, 7 p.m., UPN).
</P>
<P>
   With the very same care taken in conducting background checks
for ``Who Wants To Marry a Multimillionaire?'' this show's
producers promise that the so-called girls (or boys) being offered
up for underage sex won't really be children; they'll be at least
18 but will just look like grade schoolers.
</P>
<P>
   Aspiring pedophiles will be able to view the ``kids'' _
cavorting on swingsets, monkey bars and playing hacky-sack _ from
an onstage automobile with darkened windows.
</P>
<P>
   Prizes for the winning contestant include a new wardrobe from
Old Navy, front-row seats at a Ricky Martin concert and an
all-expenses-paid cruise to Mexico, sharing a first-class state
room with ``Uncle'' or ``Auntie'' X.

&HT;     IN POLITICS, MOTHER KNEW BEST 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     Commentary  
 &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By ROB MORSE  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ My mother and I never talked politics. She was
the smart one in the family, the one with sense, both common and
uncommon.
</P>
<P>
   Whenever the subject of politics came up in phone conversations,
she hung up her extension and let my father and me solve the
world's problems. She didn't care whether John McCain or George W.
Bush was the least bad Republican candidate for president.
</P>
<P>
   She didn't care who was a Republican and who was a Democrat, or
that I'd registered Republican to vote against Bush _ or maybe now
against McCain, who's beginning to seem the more dangerous of the
two. It was just her eldest son up to his usual stunts.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, at least since Adlai Stevenson was defeated the second
time, politics didn't matter much to her.
</P>
<P>
   People mattered. As a real estate broker on Cape Cod, she worked
hard for all her clients, whether they were rich stockbrokers
buying summer homes or young people who needed a rental so they
could study at my father's beloved Woods Hole Oceanographic
Institution.
</P>
<P>
   As a broker from another agency said at my mother's funeral
recently, ``Alice made our profession look good.''
</P>
<P>
   Alice Cooper Morse (one of the few people she disliked was the
male rock star who brazenly stole her maiden name) was the daughter
of English immigrant mill workers, and she inherited their love of
work and family. She sold her last house three days before her
heart failed, and had been tending to my hospitalized father.
</P>
<P>
   A friend found my mother dead with a New Yorker magazine open on
her chest. The cop who came to the house said she had died
peacefully. He also said the entire police force of Falmouth,
Mass., knew her and loved her.
</P>
<P>
   What is the world of politics and issues compared to that?
</P>
<P>
   My mother was political in one big way _ political with a
capital P for ``personal.'' She took injustice personally.
</P>
<P>
   As a scholarship student at Rollins College in Florida, she
worked as a nurse's aide at the local county hospital, and was
shocked to find that black patients were consigned to shacks.
</P>
<P>
   A drama major, my mother gave a speech protesting this
inhumanity, a speech broadcast over a local radio station. She was
called a communist. She went back to New England.
</P>
<P>
   I don't have to guess what she would have thought of John McCain
using the word ``gook.'' McCain acted as if it were a four-letter
word like any other.
</P>
<P>
   My mom wouldn't let him get away with that. She hated all bad
words, but knew that the G-word was far worse than the F-word. It
hurts people, not just the ears. That's unforgivable.
</P>
<P>
   My father is the political junkie in the family, a friend to
Roosevelt's brain trusters, a former Pentagon official under the
great public servant Paul Nitze and campaign chairman for the late
Mayor Carl Stokes of Cleveland. My dad is a great guy to spend time
with solving the world's problems.
</P>
<P>
   But in a sense, my mother's life has offered me the greater
political education.
</P>
<P>
   She had the unpaid career that gave America its strength after
World War II. She supported her husband while he followed his
career. She raised children almost single-handedly. Any blame for
how we turned out is solely our own, now that we're past Freud.
</P>
<P>
   After we kids had grown up, I'm told she said, ``I want to have
my own life now.''
</P>
<P>
   Over my dad's vague objections to having a working wife (where
did guys get that idea?), she got a real estate license and soon
brought home her first commission check for $14,000. Suddenly my
father was a women's liberationist, and for 30 years my mother
never stopped bringing home those checks.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, she's still owed a few checks for homes she sold in the
last weeks of her life. She started a life of her own at the age of
48 and never quit.
</P>
<P>
   My brother and sister and I found old pictures of our mom and
placed them around her casket. The service was called a
``visitation'' because there were no speeches or religious
ceremonies. My mother liked things plain and unhypocritical.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone toured the pictures of the little girl with golden
bangs feeding her doll, the high school beauty acting in plays at
the Maine men's college where she met my dad, the young mother on
the dock holding her first son and his first salmon.
</P>
<P>
   There were all the stages in an admirable life, including a
picture with Lyndon Johnson, but it wasn't the political that
mattered. What mattered was that two kids from modest hard-working
families made a good life for themselves and did the right things
in trying times, with at least one trying son.
</P>
<P>
   Now I have to face the March 7 primary in California as a
registered Republican, which wouldn't matter to my mother. But I
don't think she'd approve of her son voting for either a layabout
like George W. Bush or a misanthrope like John McCain.
</P>
<P>
   So I guess I'm now a Gore or Bradley Republican. My mother would
just shake her head and wonder who's apolitical.
</P>

&HT;     REAL ESTATE MOGUL STICKS WITH TECHNOLOGY RELIC 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By JENNY STRASBURG  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Steal his Palm V and unplug his PC, and Doug
Shorenstein could soldier on.
</P>
<P>
   But touch his 20-year-old Hewlett-Packard 12C and you are
playing with fire.
</P>
<P>
   H-P's ubiquitous business calculator, with its time-tested
Reverse Polish Notation logic, has been Shorenstein's best
technological friend since he was a Wall Street real estate
attorney in the early 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Now the chairman and chief executive of the Shorenstein Co.,
among the nation's largest and oldest privately held real estate
firms and San Francisco's dominant commercial landlord,
Shorenstein, 45, still eschews newer gadgets when he has to analyze
amortized loans and figure internal rates of return.
</P>
<P>
   ``To this date, it's amazing. It's still pretty much the
industry standard,'' said the executive, who has four or five 12Cs
scattered around his office, home and car _ each with his initials
etched into the metal.
</P>
<P>
   One reason lately for number-crunching is the Shorenstein Co.'s
ventures into new frontiers: the wiring of entire office buildings
for broad-bandwidth connections.
</P>
<P>
   Shorenstein has invested in companies including Allied Riser
Communications Corp. and Cypress Communications Inc., looking to
provide commercial tenants with one-stop shopping for
communications and Internet technology.
</P>
<P>
   Shorenstein recently answered these questions in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How is this changing your business?
</P>
<P>
   A: The real estate industry has tended to be very antiquated and
fragmented. ... The technology exists, but it hasn't been organized
and brought to buildings in an efficient manner until now.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What exactly is new?
</P>
<P>
   A: Up to now, the tenant would call the telephone company to get
a T1 line. The telephone company would drop the line somewhere out
in the elevator area. The tenant would have to figure out how to
get it to the desk, so somebody from some company would come with a
tool belt on.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Where do you step in?
</P>
<P>
   A: We've said, ``How can we provide this clear tenant need most
efficiently?'' There are many other concepts that we're either
invested in or definitely looking at _ anything that relates to
information (such as) construction management services, billing and
receivables.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: Your first computer?
</P>
<P>
   A: My H-P 12C, circa 1981. I get a kick whenever we hire MBAs
out of Stanford or wherever, and they come into the office with
their H-P 12C. ... They say, ``Do you know how to use this?'' Come
over here. I'll show you.
</P>
<P>
   Q: And beyond your 12C?
</P>
<P>
   A: I use a Palm Pilot as much as anything because I've got so
many addresses and telephone numbers in my Rolodex that I can't
keep a hard copy any more.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Web sites visited recently?
</P>
<P>
   A: A commercial real estate news site, www.ipgdirect.com, which
carried a story about our recent purchase of an office building in
New Orleans. And www.shorenstein.com _ really. We recently
developed the site, and I like to check it out from time to time to
make sure it stays current.''

<P>
   People would kill _ or at least hire a publicist _ to try to
achieve the coolness factor Chloe Sevigny has accrued in her young
life. Yet from the way Sevigny rolls her eyes when the ``C'' word
comes up, you'd think she'd kill to get rid of it.
</P>
<P>
   Was she always the hippest girl in town?
</P>
<P>
   ``No, no, no,'' she protests in a voice that is little more than
a loud whisper. ``I don't consider myself a hipster. But I've
gotten used to the idea that that tag is just something I'm going
to have to live with.''
</P>
<P>
   To dispute it further, she admits that even at the age of 25,
she lives at home with her mother in Darien, Conn. She's never even
had her own New York apartment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess I'll have to get one one of these days,'' she sighs.
``So far, I've just crashed with friends. I'm like a Connecticut
nerdy girl.''
</P>
<P>
   Nerdy is hardly the first word that Sevigny calls to mind,
unless you consider that she hit the spot where nerdy and cool came
together as an explosive fashion phenomenon. This is the woman Jay
McInerney dubbed ``the coolest girl in the world'' in a memorable
1994 New Yorker article; the girl who starred in the ultimate
street-kid movie, ``Kids''; the girl who modeled for the first-ever
Miu Miu campaign.
</P>
<P>
   With the exception of ``Kids,'' written by her longtime
on-again-off-again boyfriend, Harmony Korine, whom she met while
hanging out in Washington Square Park seven years ago, these
credentials make her cringe. She says that if she has any regrets,
it's having done the New Yorker interview at all.
</P>
<P>
   It has to be said that talking is not Sevigny's preferred
medium. Yet she has managed to give startling, memorable
performances in all kinds of movies _ from ``Kids'' to ``Gummo''
(Korine's second movie, about cat killers), Whit Stillman's ``The
Last Days of Disco,'' her 1999 trifecta ``Boys Don't Cry,''
``Julien Donkey-Boy'' and ``A Map of the World.''
</P>
<P>
   She's quick to point out that she has yet to feature in a studio
picture, although she'd love to work with Tom Cruise. This spring,
she will appear as Christian Bale's secretary in ``American
Psycho'' _ a role that has the distinction of being the only female
character he doesn't hack to bits or rape.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the time, Sevigny lets those large doe eyes of hers tell
the story.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's like a silent-movie star in that way,'' says ``Boys
Don't Cry'' director Kimberly Peirce. ``Stuff just flows across her
face.''
</P>
<P>
   For a girl who started her acting career quite accidentally (``I
wanted to do costumes for period films,'' she sighs, ``but then I
met Harmony and Larry Clark in Washington Square Park, and wound up
in `Kids'''), no one is more surprised than Sevigny herself at the
acclaim she's received this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm really lucky it was such a bad year for movies!'' she says
with a laugh. ``The whole Golden Globe thing was just surreal.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a good thing Sevigny turned out to be such a skilled
actress. She had little tolerance for her brief stints with other
careers, such as modeling.
</P>
<P>
   ``My face is totally crooked. I could never do runway. I've
modeled now and again for money because it's easy, but it's so
tedious and boring,'' she complains.
</P>
<P>
   Fashion doesn't cut it for her, either. She was hired as an
intern at Sassy in the summer of 1992 because of her uncanny
ability to spot trends.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never been interested in the high-fashion world,'' she
sniffs. ``And I never wanted to be Anna Wintour. I couldn't handle
that much responsibility. And the idea of trendspotting as a career
just sounds like hell.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet she's known for having rather fashion-forward tastes,
wearing the latest incarnations of YSL and Balenciaga to recent
movie premieres when most budding Hollywood types were barely aware
of these labels' first go-rounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``I definitely don't do fashion according to Hollywood,'' she
says with a smile, rolling her big eyes for the umpteenth time.
``You will not see me with hair extensions or pashminas. Or in
Badgley Mischka or Pamela Dennis.''
</P>
<P>
   Sevigny does acknowledge the coolness of one thing: ``Boys Don't
Cry,'' a movie that Peirce almost didn't make because so many
people in Hollywood were chasing the rights to Brandon Teena's
life. Sevigny says she would have played any part. At first, she
read for Brandon. But when Peirce asked her if she had ever wanted
to be a boy, she didn't even bother to lie and say yes. Now, of
course, it's hard to imagine anyone else in the role of Lana, the
girl Brandon fell in love with.
</P>
<P>
   ``They offered my part to two other girls before I got it,''
Sevigny admits freely. ``But I went in there and really fought for
it. I loved Lana and the footage I'd seen of her in the documentary
(``The Brandon Teena Story'') where she sings karaoke. So I copied
her style.''
</P>
<P>
   Sevigny and her co-star, Hilary Swank, even managed to make
their love scenes palatable to squeamish audiences.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a credit to what an unbelievable job Hilary did,''
Sevigny says. ``We sort of forgot she was female. Then it freaked
us out when her husband (actor Chad Lowe) came down to the set. He
made it a little harder to buy the illusion. But the whole shoot
was intense. It was the hardest film I've ever made, every aspect
of it.''
</P>
<P>
   On Feb. 15, Sevigny was nominated for an Oscar for best
supporting actress. At the time of this interview _ prior to the
Oscar announcements _ Sevigny's publicist called to say that
Entertainment Weekly was picking her as a ``shoo-in'' for a
nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Upon hearing the new, Sevigny doesn't shriek. Instead of getting
up and running to the phone, she slumps deeper into her chair, and
stares even more intently at the floor.
</P>
<P>
   ``God, I hope that's not true,'' she sighs. ``I'm not ready to
be nominated for an Oscar. I'm just not ready for that. All that
pressure. I mean, I know it wouldn't be a bad thing, but I'm not
really crossing my fingers. There are people who don't even go,
like Woody Allen,'' she says, brightening momentarily. Then the
eyes roll again. ``I doubt I could get away with that. &QL;

<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   People would kill _ or at least hire a publicist _ to try to
achieve the coolness factor Chloe Sevigny has accrued in her young
life. Yet from the way Sevigny rolls her eyes when the ``C'' word
comes up, you'd think she'd kill to get rid of it.
</P>
<P>
   Was she always the hippest girl in town?
</P>
<P>
   ``No, no, no,'' she protests in a voice that is little more than
a loud whisper. ``I don't consider myself a hipster. But I've
gotten used to the idea that that tag is just something I'm going
to have to live with.''
</P>
<P>
   To dispute it further, she admits that even at the age of 25,
she lives at home with her mother in Darien, Conn. She's never even
had her own New York apartment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess I'll have to get one one of these days,'' she sighs.
``So far, I've just crashed with friends. I'm like a Connecticut
nerdy girl.''
</P>
<P>
   Nerdy is hardly the first word that Sevigny calls to mind,
unless you consider that she hit the spot where nerdy and cool came
together as an explosive fashion phenomenon. This is the woman Jay
McInerney dubbed ``the coolest girl in the world'' in a memorable
1994 New Yorker article; the girl who starred in the ultimate
street-kid movie, ``Kids''; the girl who modeled for the first-ever
Miu Miu campaign.
</P>
<P>
   With the exception of ``Kids,'' written by her longtime
on-again-off-again boyfriend, Harmony Korine, whom she met while
hanging out in Washington Square Park seven years ago, these
credentials make her cringe. She says that if she has any regrets,
it's having done the New Yorker interview at all.
</P>
<P>
   It has to be said that talking is not Sevigny's preferred
medium. Yet she has managed to give startling, memorable
performances in all kinds of movies _ from ``Kids'' to ``Gummo''
(Korine's second movie, about cat killers), Whit Stillman's ``The
Last Days of Disco,'' her 1999 trifecta ``Boys Don't Cry,''
``Julien Donkey-Boy'' and ``A Map of the World.''
</P>
<P>
   She's quick to point out that she has yet to feature in a studio
picture, although she'd love to work with Tom Cruise. This spring,
she will appear as Christian Bale's secretary in ``American
Psycho'' _ a role that has the distinction of being the only female
character he doesn't hack to bits or rape.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the time, Sevigny lets those large doe eyes of hers tell
the story.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's like a silent-movie star in that way,'' says ``Boys
Don't Cry'' director Kimberly Peirce. ``Stuff just flows across her
face.''
</P>
<P>
   For a girl who started her acting career quite accidentally (``I
wanted to do costumes for period films,'' she sighs, ``but then I
met Harmony and Larry Clark in Washington Square Park, and wound up
in `Kids'''), no one is more surprised than Sevigny herself at the
acclaim she's received this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm really lucky it was such a bad year for movies!'' she says
with a laugh. ``The whole Golden Globe thing was just surreal.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a good thing Sevigny turned out to be such a skilled
actress. She had little tolerance for her brief stints with other
careers, such as modeling.
</P>
<P>
   ``My face is totally crooked. I could never do runway. I've
modeled now and again for money because it's easy, but it's so
tedious and boring,'' she complains.
</P>
<P>
   Fashion doesn't cut it for her, either. She was hired as an
intern at Sassy in the summer of 1992 because of her uncanny
ability to spot trends.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never been interested in the high-fashion world,'' she
sniffs. ``And I never wanted to be Anna Wintour. I couldn't handle
that much responsibility. And the idea of trendspotting as a career
just sounds like hell.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet she's known for having rather fashion-forward tastes,
wearing the latest incarnations of YSL and Balenciaga to recent
movie premieres when most budding Hollywood types were barely aware
of these labels' first go-rounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``I definitely don't do fashion according to Hollywood,'' she
says with a smile, rolling her big eyes for the umpteenth time.
``You will not see me with hair extensions or pashminas. Or in
Badgley Mischka or Pamela Dennis.''
</P>
<P>
   Sevigny does acknowledge the coolness of one thing: ``Boys Don't
Cry,'' a movie that Peirce almost didn't make because so many
people in Hollywood were chasing the rights to Brandon Teena's
life. Sevigny says she would have played any part. At first, she
read for Brandon. But when Peirce asked her if she had ever wanted
to be a boy, she didn't even bother to lie and say yes. Now, of
course, it's hard to imagine anyone else in the role of Lana, the
girl Brandon fell in love with.
</P>
<P>
   ``They offered my part to two other girls before I got it,''
Sevigny admits freely. ``But I went in there and really fought for
it. I loved Lana and the footage I'd seen of her in the documentary
(``The Brandon Teena Story'') where she sings karaoke. So I copied
her style.''
</P>
<P>
   Sevigny and her co-star, Hilary Swank, even managed to make
their love scenes palatable to squeamish audiences.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a credit to what an unbelievable job Hilary did,''
Sevigny says. ``We sort of forgot she was female. Then it freaked
us out when her husband (actor Chad Lowe) came down to the set. He
made it a little harder to buy the illusion. But the whole shoot
was intense. It was the hardest film I've ever made, every aspect
of it.''
</P>
<P>
   On Feb. 15, Sevigny was nominated for an Oscar for best
supporting actress. At the time of this interview _ prior to the

<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   It's that time again. On Feb. 15, the Oscar nominations were
announced. Suddenly, five women underwent more stylistic scrutiny
than any supermodel or society girl ever has.
</P>
<P>
   Designers in New York, Milan, Paris and Los Angeles dropped what
they were doing to take note of these ladies, who are suddenly
Fashion's Most Desirable _ at least until March 27.
</P>
<P>
   And why not? One of these candidates could emerge as the next
Gwyneth Paltrow, a celebrity who gets as much attention for her
talent as she does for her sense of style. After all, it's not a
bad runway to show off the new trends for evening: only about a
billion people will be watching.
</P>
<P>
   No designer worth his or her sequins could ever hope for better
product placement _ a dress on an Oscar nominee is better than
having a commercial on the Superbowl.
</P>
<P>
   But will the first Oscar ceremony of the new millennium be any
different than the usual frenzied parade of ballgowns?
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the worst things,'' Tom Ford notes, ``is seeing a dress
wear an actress rather an actress wear a dress.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The danger,'' says noted New York celebrity hairdresser John
Sahag, ``is that in looking glamourous, many actresses end up
looking old fashioned.''
</P>
<P>
   I decided to take a poll of fashion experts _ the designers,
hair stylists, makeup artists, clothing stylists, retailers and top
fashion editors _ to see what advice they can offer this new Top
Five.
</P>
<P>
   Some liked the challenge of glamming up the more serious
actresses, like Janet McTeer, Meryl Streep and Annette Bening.
``I'd love to see them in classic looks, sort of modernized Grace
Kelly,'' offers Jeanine Lobell, creator of Stila Cosmetics and a
veteran of Oscar makeup. ``If women like that do too much and get
too trendy, it's hard to pull off.''
</P>
<P>
   Most everyone agrees with Barneys New York creative director
Simon Doonan, who says: ``The general consensus is, it's time for
something new!'' That means no more ballgowns, beaded sweater sets,
evening separates, too-tight clothes, and death to the pastel
pashmina. But what else do Oscar fashionistas have up their silken
sleeves?
</P>
<P>
   Here, some pointers from the pros.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ANNETTE BENING, for ``American Beauty'' &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   She's always had the body and the swagger to wear anything, but
Annette Bening is loyal to one man: Giorgio Armani. She usually
wears a black column dress or black evening tuxedo. This year, she
has another requirement: on March 26, she'll be nine months
pregnant.
</P>
<P>
   DONNA KARAN: ``I want to dress Annette Bening. I like the red
evening column with a draped neckline that was a knockout on our
fall runway. I can seriously see Annette Bening in this, in either
the red or the black. I love dressing her. I think she has stature
_ divine! She is an American beauty.''
</P>
<P>
   VALENTINO: ``Even though I have not seen all the movies and I'm
not familiar with all the actresses, I believe Annette Bening has
an amazing and perfect American style.''
</P>
<P>
   AMY SPINDLER, New York Times Magazine: ``Annette Bening pretty
much always wears Armani. She's like the first lady of Hollywood
and she should dress like a first lady.
</P>
<P>
   PAMELA DENNIS: ``I love Annette, but I heard she's not going
because of the pregnancy. She's a classic beauty. Between her,
Julianne Moore and Hilary Swank, you can't do better than those
three. Not only do I respect them as artists, they also have
amazing bodies.''
</P>
<P>
   VERA WANG: ``In all fairness to Annette Bening, she's been
pregnant for eight months and she still managed to look elegant at
the Golden Globes. But I don't think for her it's a year she'll be
making a major fashion statement.''
</P>
<P>
   PHILIP BLOCH, stylist: ``Annette likes Escada. I'd suggest
something cashmere. Maybe Randolph Duke. They're pretty, they're
comfy, they're sexy. I did one for Cindy Crawford when she was
pregnant. Thank God we're not in the days of having to hide it any
more.''
</P>
<P>
   CAROL SHAW, makeup artist, did Bening's makeup for the recent
Vanity Fair cover: ``I think she's just naturally luminescent. I
would do her either very understated or with a shiny red lip. Very
Old Hollywood.''
</P>
<P>
   SALLY HERSHBERGER, hairstylist: ``She always looks great, but
I'd like to freshen up Annette Bening's look a little. I'd brighten
up her color and smooth her short hair into an Audrey Hepburn-type
of style.''
</P>
<P>
   MARK GARRISON, hairstylist: ``I'd like to see her with
chin-length hair, with lots of layers. She needs slightly more
volume and movement in her hair. She's very, very sexy, but with
hair that's too extreme _ too short, too full. I'd also like to see
more of an amber-copper mix with her color. I'd also give her long
bangs.''
</P>
<P>
   HAL RUBENSTEIN, InStyle: ``Annette Bening dresses older than she
is. She wears Armani and Escada, and it's not the designs, her
choices are a little matronly. She doesn't have a typical face. Her
hair is too big. This is a woman who is more unique looking. She's
very sexy yet she doesn't dress sexy at all. I wish she would. She
has a great capacity for seduction.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; JULIANNE MOORE, for ``The End of the Affair'' &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Julianne Moore always manages to set off those amazing red locks
with of-the-moment looks _ by Prada, Dolce &AMP; Gabbana, Ralph Lauren
_ without ever looking too fashiony or contrived. She walks the
line between fashionable and subtle without ever falling on her
heels.
</P>
<P>
   TOM FORD: ``Julianne Moore has the greatest style. I'd love to
dress her.''
</P>
<P>
   VALENTINO: ``Julianne Moore is sexy and glamorous and she's the
one I'm most curious about.''
</P>
<P>
   TOMMY HILFIGER: ``I think Julianne Moore looks very good in
casual. I'd like to see her in our leather jeans and a cashmere
turtleneck.''
</P>
<P>
   VICTOR ALFARO: ``I'd put Julianne Moore in a simple dress in a
vivid color, perhaps violet to play off her red hair. She's so
alluring and sexy.''
</P>
<P>
   HEIDI WEISEL: ``I have a beautiful brown cashmere dress in the
collection that would look great with Julianne Moore's red hair and
white skin. She should wear something fitted and sexy.''
</P>
<P>
   MARK GARRISON, hairstylist: ``For me, Julianne Moore is the
ultimate. You don't see many redheads on the screen. I would keep
her hair long, at about collarbone length, but I'd give it a bit of
angle between the cheekbone and jaws, with some long wispy layers
for movement. Her color is awesome _ I wouldn't change a thing
there.''
</P>
<P>
   BRAD JOHNS: ``Julianne Moore is an example of the perfect
redhead. She should always stay with the reds, but I would play
with red seasonally on her _ for a winter show like the Academy
Awards, I'd make her a rich auburn, and in the summer, I'd do a
gorgeous strawberry shade.''
</P>
<P>
   JAMES PURCELL: ``We need to get her to look more like a
glamorous actress than a Gucci ad. I would put Moore in something
neither over-the-top nor overly beaded, but simple and elegant with
a more dramatic hairstyle.''
</P>
<P>
   HAL RUBENSTEIN, InStyle: ``Of all the actresses nominated for
Best Actress, Julianne Moore likes clothes the most. She wears
Prada and Ralph and looks that are very simple. However, when Moore
wore a Ralph Lauren gown, the back was cut too close to the sides.
But she's very savvy not to wear looks that are too billowy or too
full. She always looks fuller than she is.''
</P>
<P>
   ANDRE LEON TALLEY, Vogue: ``Julianne Moore could go vintage. She
could look great in a Henry James dress. I would suggest she go to
Galliano. She should have major impact on the red carpet. She's
just so beautiful. She should do a Victorian Henry James look.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; JANET MCTEER, for ``Tumbleweeds'' &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The 6-foot-1-inch British actress and Tony Award winner (for ``A
Doll's House'' on Broadway in 1997) is an enigma to designers but
says that what she'll wear to the Oscars is at the bottom of her
priority list.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure somebody will come up with something nice for me to
wear,'' she said recently. ``I wore all British things to the
Golden Globes. Or I could be the first woman to wear pants to the
Oscars. But you don't often get to wear a really fancy frock in
your life, do you? So bring on the fancy frocks. I do hope all the
designers come calling. Stand in line, matey!''
</P>
<P>
   VERA WANG: ``Somebody I'd like to see make an effort is Janet
McTeer, because she's so sensual and so sexy in that film, and
she's someone who could look even better at the Academy Awards. She
has an incredibly sensual body. At the Golden Globes, she looked
like she wanted to escape it. I'm thinking something minimal but
beautifully cut, sophisticated and sensual.''
</P>
<P>
   HAL RUBENSTEIN, InStyle: ``Janet McTeer is a British actress who
blew everybody off the map when she did `A Doll's House.' She's a
very full-shaped lady, and tall, and designers should be aware of
that.''
</P>
<P>
   BRAD JOHNS: ``Janet McTeer needs to do something dramatic for
the Oscars, because a lot of us don't know her well. If she does
something really different, it'll make everyone wake up and say `Oh
my God, that's her?' I'd cut her hair _ which is too long, by the
way _ very short, and I'd bleach it beige. Then I'd do a beige gown
and taupe lips. Then, I guarantee, everyone would be talking about
her after the show because she'd look so fabulous.''
</P>
<P>
   ANDRE LEON TALLEY, Vogue: ``Janet McTeer is a very handsome
woman. She wore a twin set with a skirt with a bit of a dramatic
train to the Golden Globes. For an English woman, she looked
fantastic. She shouldn't try to upstage herself if she did well at
the Golden Globes. She looked very handsome.''
</P>
<P>
   JOHN BARRETT, hairstylist: ``Janet has a stunning face. I styled
her for the Golden Globes, and I brought out her face, using her
hair as an accessory. I also added a little red to her hair. I'd
like to see her do something similar for the Academy Awards.''
</P>
<P>
   JESSICA PASTER, stylist: ``The woman has so much presence. I'd
love to see her in something by Oscar de la Renta _ she's so
statuesque.''
</P>
<P>
   PHILLIP BLOCH, stylist: ``Someone like Janet McTeer, she's
waiting to be discovered. With her I would go with a beautiful
Badgley Mischka or Randolph Duke. She doesn't have to be
unpredictable. I love the fact that she's not a young starlet or an
older actress. I don't see her in something sexy, sexy. Maybe
Valentino or Armani. They're going through the Valentino archives.
I'm waiting for the sketches. Maybe something from the '40s. Or
there are some really great things from Chanel Couture. I could see
her in something fresh and spring-like.''
</P>
<P>
   ART LUNA, hairstylist: ``English women have these weird hairdos.
She would look so great with a short haircut. She has a
great-looking neck, that beautiful length that so many women don't
have. I'd do even a low ponytail with hair extensions at the nape,
emphasize the face and neck. That English look is such stoic
beauty. The more you add, the worse it looks.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; MERYL STREEP, for ``Music of the Heart'' &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This is Streep's 12th Academy Awards nomination, which makes her
the most nominated female ever, tying with Katherine Hepburn.
</P>
<P>
   Well, Meryl may have every bit as much talent as Hepburn _ but
if only she had half as much style. Maybe after 11 times at the
Oscars she'll finally get it right. As Tom Ford reiterated, ``Meryl
Streep may be brilliant, but fashionwise, she needs a little
help.''
</P>
<P>
   DONNA KARAN: ``I love Meryl,'' said the designer, scanning the
racks in her showroom for an example of the look she would
prescribe. She pulled out a turtleneck dress and declared it right,
with a few alterations: ``Just simple and beautiful, down to the
floor.''
</P>
<P>
   VALENTINO: ``Meryl Streep is above and beyond fashion and her
style matches her personality: warm, elegant and superior.''
</P>
<P>
   ANDRE LEON TALLEY, Vogue: ``Meryl Streep should go with
something very classic. She should do the Park Avenue Matron look
and wear a marvelous twin set, maybe an embroidered and embellished
sweater and full skirt, preferably Oscar de la Renta.''
</P>
<P>
   AMY SPINDLER, New York Times Magazine: ``Meryl Streep should
wear Michael Kors. It plays up to her sexiness. She's been playing
it down and needs to play it up. Or, she should wear Celine. Her
hair should be over one eye. Kors knows how to give the ladies of a
certain age some confidence.''
</P>
<P>
   ART LUNA, hairstylist: ``I'd like Meryl Streep to cut her hair
off a bit, something off the shoulders, short around her face. Not
anything fancy, not extremely trendy. Something along the way of
very chic, above the shoulder. Then the weight line would be at the
right length.''
</P>
<P>
   PHILIP BLOCH, stylist: ``Meryl Streep's been looking heavier. I
hope she'll be a little more glamorous at the Oscars. You don't
want her to look like the mother of the bride. I'd love to try
something a little corsety: emphasize the cleavage, suck in the
waist, push up the breasts. I rarely do black, but in this case I
might.''
</P>
<P>
   PAMELA DENNIS: ``I always wanted to dress Meryl Streep because I
respect her so much as an actress. She hasn't come off as sexy
lately, but I think she can be classy and sexy at the same time.''
For Streep, Dennis suggested a beaded white robe with pants.
</P>
<P>
   RANDOLPH DUKE: ``I'd liven up her look with a tailored jacket
and a wonderful skirt. I've spent time on the red carpet and I've
seen photographers and journalists clamoring for a quote from
Portia de Rossi, when Meryl Streep comes in and no one pays
attention to the greatest actress of our time. That's incredible.''
</P>
<P>
   HEIDI WEISEL: ``Meryl Streep is a great actress, but I think she
could use a little help in the fashion department. I'd love to make
her look glamorous and beautiful in a black strapless gown with an
A-line skirt.''
</P>
<P>
   MARK GARRISON, hairstylist: ``Of all the nominees, she's the one
that I'd most like to make over. First, I'd give her shorter hair _
something about chin length, keeping the ends soft and sexy,
something with a little volume so it's not just stuck to her head.
I'd keep her as a blonde, but give her some brighter highlights for
some depth.''
</P>
<P>
   BRAD JOHNS: ``Meryl Streep is the USA's perfect blonde. She can
wear any color blonde. If I were coloring her, I'd do a dark blonde
base with lighter tones in front and a little darker in back _ sort
of a surfer-girl shade. Her hair is too long right now.''
</P>
<P>
   VICTOR ALFARO: ``I suggest a look that's clean and simple and
something she's comfortable with, even if it's not fabulous. She
should look like herself. At this point, it doesn't matter what she
wears.''
</P>
<P>
   HAL RUBENSTEIN, InStyle: ``Meryl Streep is the one who needs the
most help. I don't think she cares enough. Maybe she should wear
Oscar de la Renta. He doesn't sacrifice a woman's elegance while
trying to make them look modern.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; HILARY SWANK, for ``Boys Don't Cry'' &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   She's this year's Oscar It Girl, with all the dream elements a
designer's looking for: tall, thin, hip, stylish, great looking,
has talent _ and a good bet to win.
</P>
<P>
   Already, Karl Lagerfeld, Donatella Versace and Tom Ford have put
her on the ``Must Dress'' list. As InStyle's Hal Rubenstein puts
it: ``Hilary Swank will be drowning in dresses.''
</P>
<P>
   ANDRE LEON TALLEY, Vogue: ``Hilary Swank has the greatest style.
She set the tone at the Golden Globes in a black Versace, and it
was a major coup for her and for Versace. She should stick with the
tried-and-true formula.''
</P>
<P>
   SIMON DOONAN, Barneys New York: ``It would be great if Hilary
Swank wore Comme des Garcons, or better yet, vintage Comme des
Garcons! My advice for the Oscars is vintage, vintage, vintage.
Hilary Swank could wear something vintage like a Dior `New Look'
dress.''
</P>
<P>
   VALENTINO: ``Hilary Swank is changing her look so as not to be
framed with the character of her movie. I know her well _ she
attended my couture show in Paris and I'm happy to help her
again.''
</P>
<P>
   RANDOLPH DUKE: ``I would pick Hilary Swank (to dress), because
she'll get the most attention _ and this is no secret _ it's all
about who will get the most attention.''
</P>
<P>
   CHRISTINA PERRIN: ``I think Hilary Swank has the most fantastic
body and that beautiful short, cropped hair. She should wear
something very sleek and dark red.''
</P>
<P>
   CAROLINA HERRERA: ``I would like to see Hilary Swank in
something different beside a slinky embroidered dress. A red
strapless dress would be beautiful.''
</P>
<P>
   VICTOR ALFARO: ``Although Hilary Swank glammed it up in Versace
Couture at the Golden Globes, I think she should wear a satin
tuxedo for a feminine/masculine play. I don't really want to see
her in a ballgown or a long dress.''
</P>
<P>
   JESSICA PASTER, veteran Oscar and Hollywood stylist: ``I have
the thrill of dressing Hilary for the Oscars this year! I think
she's our young Mia Farrow, with a sensuality about her that's the
girl next door with a little edge. I am thinking about color this
time. The Golden Globes was Hilary's first time out. I predict
she's gonna have a little more fun at the Academy Awards. We're not
married to one designer.''
</P>
<P>
   JEANINE LOBELL, Stila Cosmetics and veteran Oscar makeup artist:
``I'd like to work on Hilary Swank. I just like the way she looks
and I think that she doesn't need a lot of makeup. She's the kind
of person you'd put one thing on _ a little eye or a little lip _
she's not someone you'd like to paint everywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   JOHN SAHAG, hairstylist: ``Hilary Swank's hair looks like it's
growing out from the film. I definitely think that now that she
finished her movie she could go back to being feminine: grow the
sides, fringe, and back out, and go for something messier and more
tousled. I think that would be a nice contrast for the public to
see.''
</P>
<P>
   MARK GARRISON, hairstylist: ``Hilary should consciously play
against the androgyny we've seen of her to show her versatility.
I'd take her hair a little longer. I'd also give her soft bangs
that she could brush to the side, and layer her hair a bit on top
for volume. I'd also like to see her with some caramel highlights;
they'd give her hair a little sparkle and make it a little more
electric.''
</P>
<P>
   BRAD JOHNS, celebrity colorist, Avon Centre: ``Because she
played a boy in `Boys Don't Cry,' I'd tell her to arrive at the
Oscars totally femmed out _ big red lips, honey-colored hair,
something really high gloss, high glam. I'd dress her in a gorgeous
Badgley Mischka dress and get Kevyn Aucoin or Laura Mercier to do
really glamorous makeup on her.'' &QL;

<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   It's that time again. On Feb. 15, the Oscar nominations were
announced. Suddenly, five women underwent more stylistic scrutiny
than any supermodel or society girl ever has.
</P>
<P>
   Designers in New York, Milan, Paris and Los Angeles dropped what
they were doing to take note of these ladies, who are suddenly
Fashion's Most Desirable _ at least until March 27.
</P>
<P>
   And why not? One of these candidates could emerge as the next
Gwyneth Paltrow, a celebrity who gets as much attention for her
talent as she does for her sense of style. After all, it's not a
bad runway to show off the new trends for evening: only about a
billion people will be watching.
</P>
<P>
   No designer worth his or her sequins could ever hope for better
product placement _ a dress on an Oscar nominee is better than
having a commercial on the Superbowl.
</P>
<P>
   But will the first Oscar ceremony of the new millennium be any
different than the usual frenzied parade of ballgowns?
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the worst things,'' Tom Ford notes, ``is seeing a dress
wear an actress rather an actress wear a dress.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The danger,'' says noted New York celebrity hairdresser John
Sahag, ``is that in looking glamourous, many actresses end up
looking old fashioned.''
</P>
<P>
   I decided to take a poll of fashion experts _ the designers,
hair stylists, makeup artists, clothing stylists, retailers and top
fashion editors _ to see what advice they can offer this new Top
Five.
</P>
<P>
   Some liked the challenge of glamming up the more serious
actresses, like Janet McTeer, Meryl Streep and Annette Bening.
``I'd love to see them in classic looks, sort of modernized Grace
Kelly,'' offers Jeanine Lobell, creator of Stila Cosmetics and a
veteran of Oscar makeup. ``If women like that do too much and get
too trendy, it's hard to pull off.''
</P>
<P>
   Most everyone agrees with Barneys New York creative director
Simon Doonan, who says: ``The general consensus is, it's time for
something new!'' That means no more ballgowns, beaded sweater sets,
evening separates, too-tight clothes, and death to the pastel
pashmina. But what else do Oscar fashionistas have up their silken
sleeves?
</P>
<P>
   Here, some pointers from the pros.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ANNETTE BENING, for ``American Beauty'' &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   She's always had the body and the swagger to wear anything, but
Annette Bening is loyal to one man: Giorgio Armani. She usually
wears a black column dress or black evening tuxedo. This year, she
has another requirement: on March 26, she'll be nine months
pregnant.
</P>
<P>
   DONNA KARAN: ``I want to dress Annette Bening. I like the red
evening column with a draped neckline that was a knockout on our
fall runway. I can seriously see Annette Bening in this, in either
the red or the black. I love dressing her. I think she has stature
_ divine! She is an American beauty.''
</P>
<P>
   VALENTINO: ``Even though I have not seen all the movies and I'm
not familiar with all the actresses, I believe Annette Bening has
an amazing and perfect American style.''
</P>
<P>
   AMY SPINDLER, New York Times Magazine: ``Annette Bening pretty
much always wears Armani. She's like the first lady of Hollywood
and she should dress like a first lady.
</P>
<P>
   PAMELA DENNIS: ``I love Annette, but I heard she's not going
because of the pregnancy. She's a classic beauty. Between her,
Julianne Moore and Hilary Swank, you can't do better than those
three. Not only do I respect them as artists, they also have
amazing bodies.''
</P>
<P>
   VERA WANG: ``In all fairness to Annette Bening, she's been
pregnant for eight months and she still managed to look elegant at
the Golden Globes. But I don't think for her it's a year she'll be
making a major fashion statement.''
</P>
<P>
   PHILIP BLOCH, stylist: ``Annette likes Escada. I'd suggest
something cashmere. Maybe Randolph Duke. They're pretty, they're
comfy, they're sexy. I did one for Cindy Crawford when she was
pregnant. Thank God we're not in the days of having to hide it any
more.''
</P>
<P>
   CAROL SHAW, makeup artist, did Bening's makeup for the recent
Vanity Fair cover: ``I think she's just naturally luminescent. I
would do her either very understated or with a shiny red lip. Very
Old Hollywood.''
</P>
<P>
   SALLY HERSHBERGER, hairstylist: ``She always looks great, but
I'd like to freshen up Annette Bening's look a little. I'd brighten
up her color and smooth her short hair into an Audrey Hepburn-type
of style.''
</P>
<P>
   MARK GARRISON, hairstylist: ``I'd like to see her with
chin-length hair, with lots of layers. She needs slightly more
volume and movement in her hair. She's very, very sexy, but with
hair that's too extreme _ too short, too full. I'd also like to see
more of an amber-copper mix with her color. I'd also give her long
bangs.''
</P>
<P>
   HAL RUBENSTEIN, InStyle: ``Annette Bening dresses older than she
is. She wears Armani and Escada, and it's not the designs, her
choices are a little matronly. She doesn't have a typical face. Her
hair is too big. This is a woman who is more unique looking. She's
very sexy yet she doesn't dress sexy at all. I wish she would. She
has a great capacity for seduction.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; JULIANNE MOORE, for ``The End of the Affair'' &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Julianne Moore always manages to set off those amazing red locks
with of-the-moment looks _ by Prada, Dolce &AMP; Gabbana, Ralph Lauren
_ without ever looking too fashiony or contrived. She walks the
line between fashionable and subtle without ever falling on her
heels.
</P>
<P>
   TOM FORD: ``Julianne Moore has the greatest style. I'd love to
dress her.''
</P>
<P>
   VALENTINO: ``Julianne Moore is sexy and glamorous and she's the
one I'm most curious about.''
</P>
<P>
   TOMMY HILFIGER: ``I think Julianne Moore looks very good in
casual. I'd like to see her in our leather jeans and a cashmere
turtleneck.''
</P>
<P>
   VICTOR ALFARO: ``I'd put Julianne Moore in a simple dress in a
vivid color, perhaps violet to play off her red hair. She's so
alluring and sexy.''
</P>
<P>
   HEIDI WEISEL: ``I have a beautiful brown cashmere dress in the
collection that would look great with Julianne Moore's red hair and
white skin. She should wear something fitted and sexy.''
</P>
<P>
   MARK GARRISON, hairstylist: ``For me, Julianne Moore is the
ultimate. You don't see many redheads on the screen. I would keep
her hair long, at about collarbone length, but I'd give it a bit of
angle between the cheekbone and jaws, with some long wispy layers
for movement. Her color is awesome _ I wouldn't change a thing
there.''
</P>
<P>
   BRAD JOHNS: ``Julianne Moore is an example of the perfect
redhead. She should always stay with the reds, but I would play
with red seasonally on her _ for a winter show like the Academy
Awards, I'd make her a rich auburn, and in the summer, I'd do a
gorgeous strawberry shade.''
</P>
<P>
   JAMES PURCELL: ``We need to get her to look more like a
glamorous actress than a Gucci ad. I would put Moore in something
neither over-the-top nor overly beaded, but simple and elegant with
a more dramatic hairstyle.''
</P>
<P>
   HAL RUBENSTEIN, InStyle: ``Of all the actresses nominated for
Best Actress, Julianne Moore likes clothes the most. She wears
Prada and Ralph and looks that are very simple. However, when Moore
wore a Ralph Lauren gown, the back was cut too close to the sides.
But she's very savvy not to wear looks that are too billowy or too
full. She always looks fuller than she is.''
</P>
<P>
   ANDRE LEON TALLEY, Vogue: ``Julianne Moore could go vintage. She
could look great in a Henry James dress. I would suggest she go to
Galliano. She should have major impact on the red carpet. She's
just so beautiful. She should do a Victorian Henry James look.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; JANET MCTEER, for ``Tumbleweeds'' &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The 6-foot-1-inch British actress and Tony Award winner (for ``A
Doll's House'' on Broadway in 1997) is an enigma to designers but
says that what she'll wear to the Oscars is at the bottom of her
priority list.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure somebody will come up with something nice for me to
wear,'' she said recently. ``I wore all British things to the
Golden Globes. Or I could be the first woman to wear pants to the
Oscars. But you don't often get to wear a really fancy frock in
your life, do you? So bring on the fancy frocks. I do hope all the
designers come calling. Stand in line, matey!''
</P>
<P>
   VERA WANG: ``Somebody I'd like to see make an effort is Janet
McTeer, because she's so sensual and so sexy in that film, and
she's someone who could look even better at the Academy Awards. She
has an incredibly sensual body. At the Golden Globes, she looked
like she wanted to escape it. I'm thinking something minimal but
beautifully cut, sophisticated and sensual.''
</P>
<P>
   HAL RUBENSTEIN, InStyle: ``Janet McTeer is a British actress who
blew everybody off the map when she did `A Doll's House.' She's a
very full-shaped lady, and tall, and designers should be aware of
that.''
</P>
<P>
   BRAD JOHNS: ``Janet McTeer needs to do something dramatic for
the Oscars, because a lot of us don't know her well. If she does
something really different, it'll make everyone wake up and say `Oh
my God, that's her?' I'd cut her hair _ which is too long, by the
way _ very short, and I'd bleach it beige. Then I'd do a beige gown
and taupe lips. Then, I guarantee, everyone would be talking about
her after the show because she'd look so fabulous.''
</P>
<P>
   ANDRE LEON TALLEY, Vogue: ``Janet McTeer is a very handsome
woman. She wore a twin set with a skirt with a bit of a dramatic
train to the Golden Globes. For an English woman, she looked
fantastic. She shouldn't try to upstage herself if she did well at
the Golden Globes. She looked very handsome.''
</P>
<P>
   JOHN BARRETT, hairstylist: ``Janet has a stunning face. I styled
her for the Golden Globes, and I brought out her face, using her
hair as an accessory. I also added a little red to her hair. I'd
like to see her do something similar for the Academy Awards.''
</P>
<P>
   JESSICA PASTER, stylist: ``The woman has so much presence. I'd
love to see her in something by Oscar de la Renta _ she's so
statuesque.''
</P>
<P>
   PHILLIP BLOCH, stylist: ``Someone like Janet McTeer, she's
waiting to be discovered. With her I would go with a beautiful
Badgley Mischka or Randolph Duke. She doesn't have to be
unpredictable. I love the fact that she's not a young starlet or an
older actress. I don't see her in something sexy, sexy. Maybe
Valentino or Armani. They're going through the Valentino archives.
I'm waiting for the sketches. Maybe something from the '40s. Or
there are some really great things from Chanel Couture. I could see
her in something fresh and spring-like.''
</P>
<P>
   ART LUNA, hairstylist: ``English women have these weird hairdos.
She would look so great with a short haircut. She has a
great-looking neck, that beautiful length that so many women don't
have. I'd do even a low ponytail with hair extensions at the nape,
emphasize the face and neck. That English look is such stoic
beauty. The more you add, the worse it looks.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; MERYL STREEP, for ``Music of the Heart'' &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This is Streep's 12th Academy Awards nomination, which makes her
the most nominated female ever, tying with Katherine Hepburn.
</P>
<P>
   Well, Meryl may have every bit as much talent as Hepburn _ but
if only she had half as much style. Maybe after 11 times at the
Oscars she'll finally get it right. As Tom Ford reiterated, ``Meryl
Streep may be brilliant, but fashionwise, she needs a little
help.''
</P>
<P>
   DONNA KARAN: ``I love Meryl,'' said the designer, scanning the
racks in her showroom for an example of the look she would
prescribe. She pulled out a turtleneck dress and declared it right,
with a few alterations: ``Just simple and beautiful, down to the
floor.''
</P>
<P>
   VALENTINO: ``Meryl Streep is above and beyond fashion and her
style matches her personality: warm, elegant and superior.''
</P>
<P>
   ANDRE LEON TALLEY, Vogue: ``Meryl Streep should go with
something very classic. She should do the Park Avenue Matron look
and wear a marvelous twin set, maybe an embroidered and embellished
sweater and full skirt, preferably Oscar de la Renta.''
</P>
<P>
   AMY SPINDLER, New York Times Magazine: ``Meryl Streep should
wear Michael Kors. It plays up to her sexiness. She's been playing
it down and needs to play it up. Or, she should wear Celine. Her
hair should be over one eye. Kors knows how to give the ladies of a
certain age some confidence.''
</P>
<P>
   ART LUNA, hairstylist: ``I'd like Meryl Streep to cut her hair
off a bit, something off the shoulders, short around her face. Not
anything fancy, not extremely trendy. Something along the way of
very chic, above the shoulder. Then the weight line would be at the
right length.''
</P>
<P>
   PHILIP BLOCH, stylist: ``Meryl Streep's been looking heavier. I
hope she'll be a little more glamorous at the Oscars. You don't
want her to look like the mother of the bride. I'd love to try
something a little corsety: emphasize the cleavage, suck in the
waist, push up the breasts. I rarely do black, but in this case I
might.''
</P>
<P>
   PAMELA DENNIS: ``I always wanted to dress Meryl Streep because I
respect her so much as an actress. She hasn't come off as sexy
lately, but I think she can be classy and sexy at the same time.''
For Streep, Dennis suggested a beaded white robe with pants.
</P>
<P>
   RANDOLPH DUKE: ``I'd liven up her look with a tailored jacket
and a wonderful skirt. I've spent time on the red carpet and I've
seen photographers and journalists clamoring for a quote from
Portia de Rossi, when Meryl Streep comes in and no one pays
attention to the greatest actress of our time. That's incredible.''
</P>
<P>
   HEIDI WEISEL: ``Meryl Streep is a great actress, but I think she
could use a little help in the fashion department. I'd love to make
her look glamorous and beautiful in a black strapless gown with an
A-line skirt.''
</P>
<P>
   MARK GARRISON, hairstylist: ``Of all the nominees, she's the one
that I'd most like to make over. First, I'd give her shorter hair _
something about chin length, keeping the ends soft and sexy,
something with a little volume so it's not just stuck to her head.
I'd keep her as a blonde, but give her some brighter highlights for
some depth.''
</P>
<P>
   BRAD JOHNS: ``Meryl Streep is the USA's perfect blonde. She can
wear any color blonde. If I were coloring her, I'd do a dark blonde
base with lighter tones in front and a little darker in back _ sort
of a surfer-girl shade. Her hair is too long right now.''
</P>
<P>
   VICTOR ALFARO: ``I suggest a look that's clean and simple and
something she's comfortable with, even if it's not fabulous. She
should look like herself. At this point, it doesn't matter what she
wears.''
</P>
<P>
   HAL RUBENSTEIN, InStyle: ``Meryl Streep is the one who needs the
most help. I don't think she cares enough. Maybe she should wear
Oscar de la Renta. He doesn't sacrifice a woman's elegance while
trying to make them look modern.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; HILARY SWANK, for ``Boys Don't Cry'' &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   She's this year's Oscar It Girl, with all the dream elements a

</P>
<P>
   JOHN SAHAG, hairstylist: ``Hilary Swank's hair looks like it's
growing out from the film. I definitely think that now that she
finished her movie she could go back to being feminine: grow the
sides, fringe, and back out, and go for something messier and more
tousled. I think that would be a nice contrast for the public to
see.''
</P>
<P>
   MARK GARRISON, hairstylist: ``Hilary should consciously play
against the androgyny we've seen of her to show her versatility.
I'd take her hair a little longer. I'd also give her soft bangs
that she could brush to the side, and layer her hair a bit on top

really glamorous makeup on her.'' &QL;

   NEW YORK _ Gisele, where's your resume?
</P>
<P>
   Once upon a time, a model's career generally came and went
faster than a speeding limo. A few magazine covers, some runway
work and then a quick dive into obscurity.
</P>
<P>
   A few made it in acting, like Andie MacDowell, Lauren Hutton,
Cybill Shepherd, Farrah Fawcett or Brooke Shields, or did apparel
lines like Cheryl Tiegs and Jaclyn Smith.
</P>
<P>
   But the recent generation _ Cindy Crawford, Christy Turlington,
Naomi Campbell and Elle McPherson, to name a few _ are becoming
brands in their own right, and the potential for big bucks makes
those runway fees look like cigarette money.?
</P>
<P>
   Crawford is practically Cindy Inc., with corporate offices under
the name Crawdaddy in New York and Los Angeles that do nothing but
deal with her deals. She's got a slew of carefully selected
contracts and endorsements that include Kellogg's Special K, Omega
Watches, Pepsi and Revlon; plus she has her own projects, including
exercise tapes, a makeup book and an equity stake in Estyle.com,
where she writes a regular fashion and advice column.
</P>
<P>
   Turlington is behind the Puma-manufactured Nuala yoga apparel
line and will have her own area on a new magazine-format Web site,
Simplicity.com, to launch on Feb. 25.
</P>
<P>
   Campbell has a beauty deal with Cosmopolitan Cosmetics, the
prestige beauty arm of German beauty giant Wella, and has been
touring the world to launch her new signature fragrances. She's
also involved with politics in South Africa and has done numerous
fund-raisers there using her fashion connections.
</P>
<P>
   Elle McPherson has a lingerie line and a regular gig on
``Friends.''
</P>
<P>
   Can a model go from being just a face to a brand that consumers
will flock to?
</P>
<P>
   Why not, say their agencies. By the time a model's career is
slowing, she's already been around the world a few dozen times and
met a few hundred rich and powerful people. That can be parlayed
into great job opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   ``These girls make incredible connections when they work,'' said
Monique Pillard, president of Elite USA. ``They know how to dress,
how to speak, how to present themselves. That's very valuable when
they decide to go onto the next phase.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sure what it says about our culture, but these days,
anybody with fame or notoriety is sought after for endorsements,''
said Crawford in an interview from her Los Angeles office. ``If you
want to go into business, modeling isn't necessarily the ideal way
to start out. But if you are smart, and lucky, and people start to
know your name, you can build on that momentum.''
</P>
<P>
   For the majority, the next phase is acting. It works for some in
every generation, from Lauren Bacall to Andie MacDowell to Brooke
Shields.
</P>
<P>
   Most recently, Carolyn Murphy played an uptight WASP in Barry
Levinson's 1999 film ``Liberty Heights.'' Shalom Harlow has been
going to auditions instead of runway shows for a few seasons, and
Amber Valletta has been reading scripts backstage at shows during
fashion week.
</P>
<P>
   But what about other business ventures? Can models work a
boardroom after they've left the showroom?
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as what they are doing is appropriate to the fashion
field, it makes sense,'' said Jeff McKay, owner of his own ad
agency, Jeff McKay Inc. ``But some projects have zero credibility.
For instance, I can't stand it when people in fashion or
celebrities try to get political. My feeling is, I don't want a
model telling me what to think any more than I want a politician
telling me what to wear.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There are pros and cons,'' said Ellis Verdi, president of the
ad agency DeVito/Verdi. ``It works best if the field is related to
being a model, like fashion or health. In any case, you are
grabbing onto a known quantity, and that is a leg up for any new
company. Ultimately, any brand can become a super brand. There are
people out there who have started with a hell of a lot less and
done very nicely.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Being a model doesn't work against someone anymore,'' said
Michael Flutie, president of Company and Flutie Entertainment. ``In
the new media, especially with the Internet, it enhances the
marketability. You can build models' careers now in the same way
that you build a celebrity. The whole entertainment industry
propels models into a new career.''
</P>
<P>
   In some cases, all that time spent in front of a camera can be a
help to the business plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't have to hire a model for the initial ad campaign,
and that's a big help to the bottom line right there,'' Verdi said.
``There are some cost efficiencies there that can be pretty
significant for a startup.''
</P>
<P>
   But personality does come into play a lot more once models are
doing more talking than walking.
</P>
<P>
   To keep her credibility clean, Crawford said, she goes for
projects that build on each other. And she's got the marketing
lingo down pat.
</P>
<P>
   ``With any new proposal, I ask myself, do I believe in the
product, does it fit with my other projects?'' she said. ``For
example, a cigarette ad wouldn't add value to Revlon.''
</P>
<P>
   The silver screen is the top-ranked destination for most models
looking to their career futures. But Flutie, who has a division
that deals only with models moving into acting careers, said he
tries to get his clients to think more broadly about their future _
especially if their talent is not exactly Oscar-potential.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a girl who wanted to be an actress,'' he said. ``She
was taking lessons and working with a coach. And the coach came to
me and said, `This is not going to happen.' I had to tell her,
because it would have been wrong not to. You have to be delicate,
so what I say is, `Let's keep the acting as a hobby, and develop
something else at the same time.' I try to look at the girls'
interests. I say, `What would you be doing if you weren't
modeling?'''
</P>
<P>
   But what if the former-model-turned-ceo indulges in
stereotypical model behavior _ moody, unreliable and diva-esque?
</P>
<P>
   That doesn't matter as long as it doesn't affect the bottom
line, Verdi said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The awareness of a famous model as someone who is attractive
and healthy and vibrant is far greater than the small awareness of
someone as difficult,'' Verdi said. ``Frankly my bigger concern is
that you are dealing with someone who is used to going first-class
everywhere. What happens if her business manager comes to her and
says, `We can't afford this. You have to fly coach.' To me that is
a bigger issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Not a problem, Flutie said. Unlike previous generations that
took the money and ran, Flutie said the cadets he's seeing know a
lot more about their image and long-term market appeal.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are going to see a new generation of models driven by the
entrepreneurial spirit,'' he said. ``Girls today know more about
commerce and business.'' &QL;

BEEF WITH A BROKER? CLICK HERE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DOLORES KONG  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In this day and age, when investors can make trades and get
stock tips online, it seems only appropriate that they should be
able to use the same technology to complain about a broker.
</P>
<P>
   Government regulators and industry watchdogs are now letting
investors do just that, by putting complaint forms and a wide array
of consumer-protection material on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Three weeks ago, the Securities and Exchange Commission unveiled
its online complaint form, adding to an ever-expanding list of
investor resources at its Web site, www.sec.gov.
</P>
<P>
   Investors are already using the online forms to streamline the
complaint process, said John Gannon, acting director of the SEC's
Office of Investor Education and Assistance.
</P>
<P>
   ``The minute you click `Submit' on the form, it's here within a
matter of seconds,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, for example, an investor complained online to the
SEC that a brokerage had abruptly closed the multiple accounts he
had opened to increase his chances of getting into initial public
offerings.
</P>
<P>
   The same day, the complaint was forwarded to the brokerage, and
a response was received, Gannon said. Complaints filed by mail can
take weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The SEC worked with the brokerage and the investor, Gannon said,
getting the investor more time before accounts are closed but
explaining that a brokerage has the right to close multiple
accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Other regulatory bodies have online complaint forms, too:
</P>
<P>
   --The Massachusetts Securities Division is at
www.magnet.state.ma.us/sec/sct/sctidx.htm
</P>
<P>
   --NASD Regulation Inc. can be found at www.nasdr.com
</P>
<P>
   Gannon cautions against putting account numbers on online
complaint forms, though, since they may not be secure. A name and
an address is usually enough for a broker to figure out which
account is in question.
</P>
<P>
   But protecting investors goes beyond just providing online
complaint forms, regulators say.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the most important value that the SEC provides you
with,'' Gannon said, ``is an unbiased view on investing and
information on how to get assistance if you do run into problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of good information on the Internet, but there's
also some very bad information on the Internet. Having a government
site . . . gives people an opportunity to check other information
they find on the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   The SEC's Investor Education office has had more than 363,000
``hits'' since it was redesigned in May to make it more
consumer-friendly, Gannon said. (Click on ``Investor Assistance and
Complaints'' on the SEC's main page.)
</P>
<P>
   Investors can start with the basics, using an SEC ``road map''
to figure out financial goals, determine risk tolerance, and pick a
financial professional.
</P>
<P>
   They can also tap into a mutual fund calculator, learn how to
avoid Internet fraud, get the lowdown on initial public offerings,
or IPOs, and find out about Edgar, the SEC's electronic database of
documents that companies are required to file.
</P>
<P>
   There is also information about the dangers of day trading.
</P>
<P>
   One of the site's most popular features is the search function,
Gannon said. It lets you use keywords to find a particular topic.
</P>
<P>
   The main SEC site also has information about the latest
enforcement actions, including the agency's 1999 case against three
people who illegally offered stock on e-Bay, an Internet auction
site.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a place that investors can go to 24 hours a day to get
information from the SEC,'' Gannon said.
</P>
<P>
   The Massachusetts Securities Division's site offers similar
material.
</P>
<P>
   Visitors can, for example, print out a form that helps them keep
notes when they speak with a broker. They can also get a list of
``10 Do's and Don'ts for Investors.''
</P>
<P>
   And the site for NASD Regulation, an independent subsidiary of
the National Association of Securities Dealers Inc., allows
consumers to check for complaints or disciplinary actions against
brokers and brokerage firms. An investor can then make an online
request that public records about the cases be mailed to him or
her.
</P>
<P>
   Other Internet sites for investors include:
</P>
<P>
   --The Federal Trade Commission, at www.ftc.gov
</P>
<P>
   --www.nasaa.org
</P>
<P>
   --www.fraud.org
</P>
<P>
   --www.natlconsumersleague.org

   --www.investorprotection.org

DIALLO CASE LEAVES SHARPTON'S STATURE ENHANCED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRED KAPLAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ There's the cat with nine lives. There's the phoenix
rising from the ashes. And then there's the Rev. Al Sharpton.
</P>
<P>
   It is hard to think of another public figure who has not merely
bounced back from so many disasters, but bounced to ever-loftier
heights with each return.
</P>
<P>
   With the acquittal of the four white police officers who killed
Amadou Diallo and the case's angry aftermath, Sharpton has emerged
once again, and more than before, as New York City's clear black
leader, crying out with equal passion for justice and nonviolence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let not one brick be thrown . . . not one epithet of violence
come from us,'' he declared after the verdict Friday. While he may
not deserve all the credit for the peaceful nature of the protests
so far, few would deny him a large share of it.
</P>
<P>
   It is a far cry from 10 and 15 years ago, when Sharpton made his
mark as an aggravator of racial tension in a racially tense time.
It is a far cry from 1995, when black street vendors picketed a
Jewish-owned clothing store in Harlem. Sharpton joined them,
calling the owner a ``white interloper''; a few days later, one of
the pickets burned down the store, killing eight people trapped
inside.
</P>
<P>
   Few thought Sharpton would recover from just two years ago, when
Stephen Pagones successfully sued him for defamation of character.
In 1988, in one of the most racially polarizing episodes of recent
New York history, Sharpton accused Pagones, then an assistant
district attorney, of raping a black teenager named Tawana Brawley.
Even after Brawley's tale had been discredited, Sharpton continued
to defend her and to insist Pagones was guilty.
</P>
<P>
   Sharpton had just finished a close second in the Democratic
mayoral primary when that long-delayed trial got underway in 1997.
He had considered running for US Congress that fall. But, as one of
his aides said at the time, the backlash over the Brawley case,
which ended with a verdict against Sharpton in July 1998, put an
end to that notion.
</P>
<P>
   He assumed a lower profile. It seemed for a moment that his
dreams of being ``the Jesse Jackson of New York'' might be
finished.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in February last year, four white police officers fired 41
bullets at Amadou Diallo, a West African immigrant who stood
unarmed outside his apartment building in the Bronx. Sharpton
immediately and forcefully stepped in to his customary role as
advocate and protest-leader, and he was embraced by Diallo's
parents as their spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   He had tried to assume this role in a similar incident the
previous summer when a Haitian immigrant, Abner Louima, was
tortured and sodomized by a police officer inside the bathroom of
the 70th Precinct stationhouse in Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   In that case, however, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani leapt into
action, appearing repeatedly at Louima's hospital bedside,
denouncing the officer who committed the heinous act, and
appointing a bipartisan commission (which he later disavowed) to
recommend reforms in police practices.
</P>
<P>
   After the Diallo shooting, Giuliani hesitated, withheld
judgment, and waited a little too long even to go meet with
Diallo's parents _ by which time Sharpton was already on the scene,
and in control.
</P>
<P>
   For months, Sharpton led one of the longest and most broadly
attended string of antipolice protests that this city had ever
seen. Thousands of citizens of all races, including prominent
politicians, marched on police headquarters and had themselves
arrested for civil disobedience.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani enhanced Sharpton's image further by waving the scene
off as ``silly'' and a ``publicity stunt.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Sharpton was looking like not only a local leader but
an international statesman, accompanying Diallo's parents to Guinea
for their son's funeral.
</P>
<P>
   Many white New Yorkers, and many black ones, still hold Sharpton
in contempt for his past actions and for the streak of opportunism
that they still see in his current campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   Still, even his critics would not deny that Sharpton, at age 45,
is a political force and a player at the big table.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 1992, Bill Clinton went to a Rainbow Coalition dinner and
denounced Sistah Souljah,'' Sharpton said in a recent interview,
referring to the rap singer whom the president criticized in an
attempt to show white voters that he was not too beholden to
certain blacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, Hillary Clinton and Al Gore both have to come up here and
see me. What does that tell you?'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, when black politicians meet in Washington, D.C., with
US Justice Deptartment officials to discuss the possibility of
trying the officers on federal charges of violating Diallo's civil
rights, it will be Sharpton who leads the delegation.
</P>

   But the full sign of Sharpton's arrival came two weeks ago
during the debate between Gore and Bill Bradley at the Apollo
Theater in Harlem. Sharpton helped set up the event, the first
presidential debate ever to take place in New York's black
community.
</P>
<P>
   The moderator, Bernard Shaw of CNN, started things off by giving
the first question to Sharpton, who he said ``has played an
instrumental role in bringing about this dialogue.''
</P>
<P>
   Sharpton stood in the audience, to respectful applause, wearing
his three-piece suit and his well-combed pompadour, and asked what
the candidates would do to stop racial ``profiling'' without
causing an increase in crime.
</P>
<P>
   It was a subtle question, acknowledging that even unjustly
aggressive police tactics have contributed to a reduction in crime,
and wondering how to restrain the cops without unleashing the
robbers.
</P>
<P>
   Neither candidate really answered the question.

ROLLOVER PLAN PUTS IRA IN DANGER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KENNETH HOOKER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. I put 15 percent of my earnings into my employer's 401(k)
plan, with various matches from my employer. My 401(k) from a
previous employer has $135,000 in Fidelity Overseas, $4,000 in
Fidelity Magellan, and the rest in other funds. The former employer
has been taken over by a large corporation, and the 401(k) plan is
soon to be liquidated. I have opened an IRA brokerage account with
Fidelity Investments and plan to roll the 401(k) assets into this
account. I plan to be very aggressive, splitting the money into
about six technology and overseas markets funds with no load and no
transaction fees. I am considering Fidelity Aggressive Growth,
Fidelity Growth Company, Fidelity Overseas, Janus Global
Technology, Janus Mercury, Janus Olympus, Internet, Warburg Pincus
International Small Company, Warburg Pincus Japan Small Company,
Warburg Pincus Japan Growth, Matthews Korea, and Matthews Japan I.
What selections would you make? I plan to retire at 70.
</P>
<P>
   M.J., Chelsea, Mass. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Rather than choose from these funds, I'd rather try to
dissuade you from the approach you're contemplating. With your
focus on transaction fees, it seems your plan involves putting the
rollover IRA in some pretty risky funds, as well as trading
actively.
</P>
<P>
   The combination of high-risk funds and an active trading pace
boils down, in my opinion, to little more than speculation. Some of
these funds' returns are mighty spectacular. The Internet fund in
1998 and 1999 returned 196.1 percent and 216.4 percent,
respectively, for example. But with such results comes a lot of
volatility and risk.
</P>
<P>
   If you leave the $140,000 in fairly conservative stock funds for
the 32 years until you retire and get average annual returns of
only 10 percent, you'd have $2,955,928. Can you really afford to
risk that by fooling around in the very hot but volatile markets
many of these funds operate in?
</P>
<P>
   My suggestion: Invest no more than 30 percent of the rollover
IRA in high-risk funds. You might begin by putting 40 percent in
Fidelity Spartan Market Index _ substantially a clone of Vanguard's
Index 500 fund, right down to the low expense ratio _ and 30
percent in Fidelity Overseas fund.
</P>
<P>
   If I were to pick funds from your list for the final segment of
the portfolio, I'd put 10 percent into Janus Global Technology and
10 percent in Janus Mercury and split the final 10 percent between
the Internet fund and Fidelity Select Health Care (one that's not
on your list). Fidelity Select has a 3 percent front-end load, but
if you do what I hope you will do with it _ hold it for a quarter
century or so _ that load will soon seem very easy to bear.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I'd like to retire at 60. I am a partner in a small business
and earn $160,000 a year and put $34,000 a year into a tax-deferred
Keogh plan and a Roth IRA. My partner will buy me out when I am 60
for $250,000 in today's money, adjusted for inflation. At 62, I'll
have my late husband's pension, which will be $31,000 a year, also
inflation-adjusted. At 63, I will receive Social Security of
$8,315; at 64 it will increase to $25,694. I will need $111,000 a
year to live on. Are my investments too risky? How much will my
$760,000 come to in nine years with additions of $34,000 a year?
How much will the total be worth in inflation-adjusted dollars? How
much income might I expect with a 7 percent yield, adjusted for
inflation?
</P>
<P>
   S.C., Boston &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. You should be in very nice shape _ especially if you reduce
the risk. Your holdings would be fine if you were 10 years younger,
but since you're entering the period in which you should begin
getting more conservative, I suggest a number of moves, all
designed to begin the process toward a yield-oriented portfolio in
nine years.
</P>
<P>
   Here's the math: If you achieve average portfolio returns of 8
percent and add $34,000 a year to savings, you would amass
$1,959,507 in nine years. If inflation averaged 3.5 percent, you'd
have about $1,438,000 in today's money.
</P>
<P>
   As for financial needs, again using current dollar values, from
your savings you would require $61,000 at ages 60 and 61, $21,685
at ages 62 and 63, $4,306 at age 64, and thenceforth $54,303 a
year.
</P>
<P>
   So basically what you are trying to work toward is a portfolio
evenly divided among stocks, which should protect you against later
inflation, and bonds, which would supply the lion's share of your
needed income. If half the portfolio were in fixed-income
investments with an average yield of 7 percent, that would supply
you with an inflation-adjusted yield of $50,330.
</P>
<P>
   I'd simply withdraw the extra $10,670 from the stock side during
the first two years of retirement, then replace it during years
three, four, and five, when your income will exceed your needs. If
the yield from the fixed-income portfolio doesn't quite fulfill
your needs after age 65, you could withdraw the yield (but not the
capital gains distributions) from your stock portfolio.
</P>
<P>
   I use an 8 percent growth estimate because it appears to me that
you can greatly reduce risk in the portfolio and still comfortably
achieve your goals. In the process, you can balance the portfolio a
little better, getting away from the heavy over-reliance on the
large-cap growth and large-cap blend funds that now dominate the
portfolio. Now, the only fixed-income element is the 37.2 percent
of the Janus Balanced holding, which is in cash and bonds; that
works out to 3.6 percent of the portfolio. (That calculation may be
off a bit, because the fund balances you supplied add up to
$741,400 rather than $760,000; perhaps you forgot a holding. If
that's the case, I hope it was a bond fund.)
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, I suggest taking half the balance in seven large-cap
funds _ Fidelity's Dividend Growth, Blue Chip, and Contrafund and
Janus's Equity Income, Growth and Income, Mercury, and Twenty _ and
transferring the proceeds to the bond side.
</P>
<P>
   With Fidelity, I'd put half of the money in Fidelity Ginnie Mae
fund, a quarter in Fidelity Short-Term Bond fund, and a quarter in
Fidelity Capital and Income.
</P>
<P>
   I'd move half of the Janus balances _ plus $46,120 from Janus
Worldwide _ and invest in a similar portfolio, with 50 percent in
Janus Flexible Income and 25 percent each in Janus Short-Term Bond
and Janus High Income.
</P>
<P>
   Thatr would bring the fixed-income side of the portfolio
(including part of the Janus Balanced holding) to 35 percent. I'd
then suggest using your ongoing contributions to slowly enlarge the
fixed-income side, so that by the time you retire you have an even
balance of stocks and bonds.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Money musings: Recent letters have asked about building a
separate portfolio (in addition to regular retirement savings) to
cover emergency health care costs, instead of buying one of the
expensive extended health care policies _ in effect a
self-insurance scheme. One writer proposed funding the pool with
$25,000; another was planning on $100,000.
</P>
<P>
   I am unenthusiastic. Extended-care policies are designed to
protect against enormous, unpredictable, extended bills, and even
with a $100,000 investment there might not be enough money to cover
a serious illness.
</P>
<P>
   Self-insurance might work for a few _ people whose names appear
on magazine lists of the nation's wealthiest individuals _ but for
the rest of us, I fear, self-insuring is a luxury we can't afford.

   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TINA CASSIDY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The Hoover Dam was supposed to cost $155 million and
take seven years to build. Turns out, it was cheaper and quicker to
tame the Colorado River than most predicted.
</P>
<P>
   ``It came in at $151 million . . . and they did it in five
years. Actually, four years, 354 days, if you want to be exact,''
said Pete Mayes, a guide at the Hoover Dam, the largest structure
of its kind when it was completed in 1935.
</P>
<P>
   The Golden Gate Bridge project was also on budget and on time,
completed in 1937 after about four years of laboring. The cost: $35
million, not counting the $39 million in bond interest, all
financed with tolls.
</P>
<P>
   One may not think such fast, frugal construction projects _ born
of the Depression-era when workers formed lines to be chosen for
jobs and their bosses made them toil harder and faster to trim
payroll costs _ could be accomplished today, especially as cost
estimates for the Big Dig climb over $12 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Just to plan and approve earthquake-proofing additions to the
famous San Francisco Bay span took nine years, and the job itself,
which began in 1997, is budgeted at $300 million. ``The
bureaucratic process,'' lamented bridge spokeswoman Mary Currie.
</P>
<P>
   However, the $20 billion Chek Lap Kok Airport, which relocated
Hong Kong's airport to a man-made island in 1998, was completed
largely on schedule. Despite tales of corruption and technical
glitches, the project also came in $1 billion under budget.
</P>
<P>
   Yet as Boston's $12.2 billion Central Artery/Tunnel project
struggles with cost overruns and delays _ although officials insist
it is now on schedule _ engineers defend the Big Dig as being
unique in scope, scale, and complications, just as the Golden Gate
Bridge and Hoover Dam were for their time.
</P>
<P>
   Project officials say a booming economy, unforseen problems
underground, and the logistics of keeping a city running as
smoothly as possible while about 80 miles of lanes are built
beneath it, are what make this project different.
</P>
<P>
   ``What distinguishes this project from every other major
public-works project ever done is we are tunneling under an active
city through very uncertain ground. It's basically all fill,'' Big
Dig project spokesman Terry Brown said. ``We are finding out what
it costs to go through this.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown said the Channel Tunnel that connects England and France _
also overbudget and off schedule when it opened in 1994 _ was
underwater but not under a city.
</P>
<P>
   And the Panama Canal project grappled with disease and a harsh
environment.
</P>
<P>
   ``They took 10 years. We are taking 14,'' Brown said of the
Central America shipping lane. ``We don't have jungle, earthslides,
and malaria; we have a city, and we have to keep that city open.''
</P>
<P>
   For example, he said, when preset decibel levels for
construction were annoying businesses and keeping residents awake
at night, Big Dig officials ``had to go back and customize noise
specifications on downtown contracts.''
</P>
<P>
   The project had to pay for such things as insulating windows and
building a ``noise curtain.''
</P>
<P>
   John Connelly, a Peabody &AMP; Arnold partner who specializes in
construction law, said urban construction is often more costly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any project where you are dealing not out in a desert, but in
a city with all the limitations and restrictions that imposes on
you, it's going to take you more time and it's going to be more
expensive to do,'' he said. ``Often I view it in terms of the way
most cities and towns in Massachusetts are dealing with schools.
The time it costs to renovate a school that is unoccupied versus
the time and cost of renovating a school that is operating . . . is
going to be more expensive.''
</P>
<P>
   Less easily moved than students is the existing highway
structure near the FleetCenter in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   The inverted Y-shaped bridge being constructed to connect the
downtown with Interstate 93 has a distinctive-looking cable design,
not simply for aesthetic reasons but because the current elevated
roadway is in the way of construction and must remain in place
until the new span is complete.
</P>
<P>
   In California, a difficult urban project had to be abandoned
recently. In 1998, voters, disgusted with construction problems,
cost overruns, and corruption dropped a $300 million-per-mile
subway extension in Los Angeles County.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's the Channel Tunnel, which in many ways is
comparable to the Big Dig in that both have had to move a lot of
dirt.
</P>
<P>
   The Chunnel, as it is called, moved 20 million cubic-meters of
earth and rubble, the equivalent to 14 pyramids of Cheops. The Big
Dig will have moved enough dirt to fill Foxboro Stadium 13 times.
</P>
<P>
   The Chunnel also cost $15 billion, nearly twice the estimate,
and was more than a year behind schedule, although it fulfilled a
200-year French dream of re-connecting the continent with England.
</P>
<P>
   The Big Dig, in some ways, could feel less historic.
</P>
<P>
   According to ``Facts and Figures about the Central Artery/Tunnel
Project,'' a Big Dig reference guide, when construction is
complete: ``There will be normal urban rush hours of a couple of
hours in the morning and evening on the underground expressway,
with traffic moving at about 30 miles per hour.''

THE MOST UN-CLINTON CANDIDATE SURGES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SCOT LEHIGH  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's a puzzle for issue-oriented voters: Why has a broad swath
of the moderate American middle fallen for a presidential candidate
whose congressional record on matters like gun control, abortion,
and the environment should put him far to the right of mainstream
opinion?
</P>
<P>
   And fallen it has. Arizona Senator John McCain is more than
simply the favorite of anti-Bush Republicans. As Tuesday's Michigan
primary results showed, the McCain magnetism is more mesmerizing to
independents and Democrats than to Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   A new CNN/USA Today national poll, taken even before the
Michigan results rolled in, gave McCain a staggering 24-point lead
_ 59 to 35 percent _ over Vice President Al Gore in a head-to-head
matchup, with McCain winning 60 percent of independents and 27
percent of Democrats surveyed.
</P>
<P>
   So what's the key to the puzzle? The ascendancy of character in
voters' minds, something that comes in no small part as a reaction
to Bill Clinton's presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Elections usually take shape either as character contests or
issue tussles, with one generally trumping the other. Remember the
rise and fall of Jimmy Carter? Pledging never to lie and to lead a
government as good and decent as the American people, Carter won
the presidency in a character election in 1976 _ only to surrender
it on issues in recession-bogged 1980.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the McCain phenomenon, so strong that it's reordering
party registrations, is all about biography and personal qualities
and almost completely divorced from ideology. For proof, one need
look no further than the flow of the daily news narrative, which
speaks of endorsements and momentum and money, strategy and
tactics, but says little or nothing of record or policy.
</P>
<P>
   Even the one issue the candidates have jousted on in the last
few weeks _ who is the real reformer? _ is really a proxy for
character. The heart of the dispute is not specifics, but rather
which man displays the qualities of iconoclasm and independence.
</P>
<P>
   All that's fine by McCain's camp. ``These races should be about
character,'' San Diego Mayor Susan Golding, who endorsed McCain on
Thursday, told the press. Certainly Michigan was. Exit polls showed
that Texas Governor George W. Bush won narrowly among voters who
cared most about issues, only to have McCain swamp him among those
who said personal qualities should be paramount.
</P>
<P>
   Such a campaign plays to McCain's strengths, and to Al Gore's
weaknesses _ a difference that will be cast in sharp relief if
McCain and Gore become their parties' nominees. And if in the wee
existential hours of the night, Gore curses the new poll and
wonders whom to blame for this troubling state of affairs, he need
look no farther than the man he considers one of the nation's great
presidents.
</P>
<P>
   Although he won the presidency in an issues campaign, Clinton's
legacy to his successor is a political environment where character
is once again ascendant. That environment has proved a political
hothouse for the McCain candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reason people find McCain so attractive is that he seems
in fact to be the anti-Clinton,'' avers Peggy Noonan, the
well-known Republican speechwriter and author.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic pollster Peter Hart agrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think voters are looking for a way to change the moral tone
of this country, the sense of values and character,'' he says.
``That is what was working for Bill Bradley and it is what is
working for John McCain.''
</P>
<P>
   Why is McCain the anti-Clinton? Start with biography.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton managed to avoid the draft. McCain fought in Vietnam,
and spent 5 1/2 years in a prisoner of war camp for his efforts. If
his combat record itself isn't heroic, his prison years tell a tale
of courage, grit, and character.
</P>
<P>
   On to integrity. Clinton is a skillful practitioner of the art
of, ahem, linguistic misdirection, whereas McCain has become famous
as a straight shooter.
</P>
<P>
   Or personal responsibility. Even testimony sworn under the pain
and penalties of perjury couldn't get the president to own up to
his own conduct. McCain, by contrast, strews mea culpas like Johnny
Appleseed sowing new McIntosh trees.
</P>
<P>
   Or even raison d'etre. Clinton took fund-raising to such
extremes the 1996 presidential campaign became a national scandal
that is still playing out in the court system. McCain has made
campaign-finance reform _ particularly the elimination of soft
money _ such a rallying cry that it has become virtually his
unified-field theory for remedying nearly every problem.
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton hasn't simply elevated the importance of character
through his own well-illumined personal failings. He has also done
that by reducing the importance of ideology.
</P>
<P>
   After the failure of his universal health care proposal in 1994,
Clinton tacked steadily toward the center, abandoning ambitious
progressive goals and embracing the end of welfare as an
entitlement, value-neutral trade deals, spending levels that shrink
the budget in proportion to the overall economy, and the notion
that a president's primary role is to safeguard the economic boom.
</P>
<P>
   That's been a successful centrist course for the party Clinton
leads, but it's a political path that has diminished the role of
ideology in the race to succeed him. And as issues have shrunk,
character, naturally enough, has become more important.
</P>
<P>
   Which is bad news for Gore. As has become apparent in this
campaign, the vice president suffers from a Clintonesque tendency
to wander off truth's trail in search of a shortcut to political
advantage; less nimble than his mentor, Gore then tends to blunder
about in the tangled jungle of evasion, sometimes wounding himself
with his own machete.
</P>
<P>
   Lou DiNatale, director of the University of Massachusetts Poll,
says that disparity in motivation shows up in his latest poll of
Massachusetts voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``The number one reason people are voting for Gore is his
policies,'' DiNatale said. ``The number one reason people are
voting for McCain is honesty and integrity.''
</P>
<P>
   Oddly, there's some good news there for the vice president,
because that conclusion suggests McCain's appeal to moderates would
fade if the campaign template were to shift from character to
issues. Although the Arizonan's signature issue _ campaign-finance
reform _ is broadly popular with the American people, his record in
the House and Senate is a very conservative one.
</P>
<P>
   As a candidate McCain has managed to persuade many abortion
rights supporters that outlawing abortion isn't a priority for him.
But actually he has actively and steadfastly opposed abortion
rights. According to the National Abortion and Reproductive Rights
Action League, McCain has voted an antichoice position 94 out of
103 times since entering Congress in 1983.
</P>
<P>
   One measure of McCain's commitment: He not only backed the
Bush-era ``gag rule'' that prohibited publicly funded health-care
clinics from even discussing abortion as an option, last year he
led efforts in the Senate to reintroduce that gag rule, which
Clinton repealed in the first days of his presidency.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has a starkly antichoice record, and he has not been
passive in his opposition to a woman's right to choose,'' says Kate
Michelman, president of NARAL. ``He has at times taken the lead in
moving legislation that is extremely harmful to reproductive
rights.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain's record is almost as conservative on gun control.
According to the Handgun Control Inc., the country's largest
gun-control lobbying organization, he has frequently opposed
gun-control measures, including the Brady Bill in 1991 and 1993 and
the assault-weapons ban in 1990 and 1993.
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of the Columbine High School killings, McCain twice
voted against a provision to require criminal background checks at
gun shows. ``He is a conservative, pro-gun senator who
traditionally votes with the NRA,'' says Joe Sudbay, the group's
political director.
</P>
<P>
   Skeptical of unions and reliably pro-business, McCain has
repeatedly opposed efforts to raise the minimum wage. He has also
voted against antidiscrimination job protection for gays.
</P>
<P>
   Although Arizona environmentalists give him solid marks on issue
like protecting the Grand Canyon and preserving wilderness areas in
his home state, his national environmental voting record is poor.
According to Deb Callahan, president of the League of Conservation
Voters, during his 17-year career in the House and the Senate,
McCain has voted the pro-environmental position only 19 percent of
the time.
</P>
<P>
   Rob Smith, Arizona-based Southwest staff director for the Sierra
Club, puts it this way: ``His Arizona record is respectable, with
real accomplishments, but when it comes to action on the national
scene, he has typically voted with the anti-environmental forces of
his party.''
</P>
<P>
   And though McCain has been something of a maverick in the
Senate, that shouldn't be confused with being a moderate. Not, at
least, in the New England understanding of the term: On social and
economic issues he votes the conservative position 70 to 80 percent
of the time. A supporter of Newt Gingrich's Contract with America,
he was one of the Republican senators who voted to impeach Bill
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   None of that suggests McCain's issue positions put him beyond
the political pale. Rather, the point is this: If voters come to
assess him ideologically rather than characterologically, much of
the bloom _ and perhaps even some of the petals _ would quickly
come off the reformer's rose.
</P>
<P>
   Former US Representative Chester Atkins, a Democrat who served
with McCain in Congress and got to know him well when the two
served as election observers in Central America together, puts it
this way: ``He is a terrific guy, he is a wonderful person. But he
is not even a moderate Republican. He is a very conservative,
pro-gun, antichoice Republican.''
</P>
<P>
   That's why the task for Gore, should he face McCain, would be
clear. ``If McCain's hope is to make people focus on his personal
history, Gore's job will be to make people look at McCain's Senate
record,'' says Democratic consultant Dan Payne.
</P>
<P>
   That won't necessarily be easy. Sometimes the thirst for heroism
and the impact of biography is so powerful that issues just don't
count. Among presidential historians, the ``Tippecanoe and Tyler
Too'' campaign of 1840 still stands as an example of that. The Whig
Party took William Henry Harrison, a well-born, college-schooled
former military man whose lackluster record included driving off
the Shawnees at Tippecanoe, and sold him as a plainspoken, rustic
military hero. Meanwhile, incumbent Martin Van Buren was portrayed
as a guileful, effete aristocrat.
</P>
<P>
   But it's hard to see that kind of campaign happening again. Here
at the cusp of the new century, we're not quite so easily
distracted . . . are we?

NEW ENGLAND'S BIG PRIZE GETTING LITTLE ATTENTION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL CROWLEY AND MICHAEL KRANISH  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW HAVEN _ George W. Bush grew out of boyhood at Phillips
Academy in Massachusetts. He grew into a man at Yale University in
Connecticut. And he learned countless lessons of life at his
father's side in Kennebunkport, Maine.
</P>
<P>
   But now that Bush is seeking the presidency, he is learning
another lesson: New Hampshire's fling with Senator John McCain may
be extending to the five other New England states, with an intense
struggle developing over what the Texas governor once hoped would
be a safe political home away from home.
</P>
<P>
   In the national political conversation, the March 7 New England
vote has received relatively little notice amid the talk about the
other primaries on ``Super Tuesday,'' including those in
California, Ohio, New York, and Georgia. But to the campaigns, New
England is viewed as a vital megastate with a total of 102
delegates, one more than New York and an immense prize by any
standard.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the Republican campaigns, as well as the Democratic
ones, are placing significant emphasis on New England. McCain is
especially focusing on the region, allotting two to three days this
week to campaign here even though some advisers would prefer that
he take New England for granted and focus on California. Bush, by
contrast, so far has plans to campaign only in Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   Bush is counting on strong organizations and the fact that most
of the region's GOP primaries are closed or open only to
independents. Only Vermont allows Democrats to vote in the GOP
primary.
</P>
<P>
   ``The New England voter is more independent-minded and more
moderate, and the religious right is far less strong here, so that
really'' gives the advantage to ``a candidate like John McCain,''
said Darrell West, a professor of political science at Brown
University. ``I'd be shocked if McCain didn't sweep the region. New
Hampshire is the most conservative state, and McCain has already''
won there by 19 points.
</P>
<P>
   On the Democratic side, Vice President Al Gore is well ahead in
several polls in New England states, although the Bradley campaign
sees reason for hope in the independent-minded region. The
Democratic race could have a major impact on the Republican side
because independents in several states will be choosing from among
all the candidates in both parties. A rush to McCain by
independents could hurt Bradley, or vice versa.
</P>
<P>
   Compared with the hugely expensive fight over New Hampshire, the
tussle over the rest of New England is the very model of Yankee
frugality. Both party's campaigns have devoted little money to the
region, preferring to dump millions of dollars into California and
New York.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, for example, has not opened offices in Maine, Vermont, or
Rhode Island. The McCain effort is almost entirely volunteer, with
most ``headquarters'' actually being the home of a supporter.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush campaign has come up with an intriguing strategy that
may raise eyebrows elsewhere. In conservative South Carolina, Bush
backers said McCain was too moderate. But in the more moderate
region of New England, Bush supporters plan to say McCain is too
conservative.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is puzzling to us that liberal and moderate independent
voters are supporting John McCain when he's diametrically opposed
to them on many social issues,'' said Rob Gray, top political
adviser to Massachusetts Governor Paul Cellucci, a Bush ally.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush campaign seems most hopeful about Connecticut. Bush,
unlike McCain, has an office in Connecticut. Two paid and three
volunteer staff members work in the headquarters in Greenwich,
where Bush's father grew up. McCain's Connecticut office is in a
volunteer's home.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Bush family is a known commodity in Connecticut. They've
always fared well politically here, and all things considered I
think George W. will benefit from that legacy,'' said Jay
Malcynsky, Bush's state campaign manager.
</P>
<P>
   But in what may be an ominous sign for the Bush campaign, an
operator at the Connecticut secretary of state's office had this to
say when asked if independents have been calling to change their
party affiliation to Republican: ``Oh, my goodness. My goodness. .
. . They're talking about John McCain.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain's Connecticut director, Benjamin Davol, has no budget and
no staff, but the McCain campaign nonetheless has used volunteers
and the national momentum of the race to turn a huge deficit in the
polls into a 13-point lead. Some Connecticut residents have
acquired boxes from a potato chip company named McCain and posted
them on their front lawn, offering a show of support for the
senator, if not the chips. Others have used materials left over
from the New Hampshire campaign.
</P>
<P>
   At the Delta Kappa Epsilon fraternity house at the Yale
University, there is an outpost of optimism for New England
supporters of the Texas governor. Never mind that there are more
signs in the house reading ``Busch,'' the beer, than Bush, the
candidate. The members of the fraternity Bush once belonged to are
gung-ho about their brother.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're all pushing for him,'' said DKE president Charles Buck.
``Bush is a Yale guy, and this would be his home territory.''
</P>
<P>
   But a few blocks away, steelworker Jamie Della Camera sat on a
barstool and said he intends to switch his party affiliation so he
can vote in the state's Republican-only primary for the Arizona
senator.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he's a solid guy,'' he said. As for Bush? ``Forget
about it.''
</P>
<P>
   In Massachusetts, more than 20,000 voters have switched their
party affiliation, apparently to back McCain, and a new Globe poll
shows McCain with a 27 percentage point lead.
</P>
<P>
   Bush backers seemed resigned to bad news.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no question that John McCain is doing very well with
independents right now,'' said Gray. ``And independent turnout will
have a big effect on the Massachusetts primary.''
</P>
<P>
   In Maine, where the Bush family summers in Kennebunkport, Bush
chairman Ross Connelly said he hopes that independents will be
deterred from voting in the GOP primary by a provision requiring
them to join the Republican Party for a minimum of three months if
they want to participate in the GOP vote.
</P>
<P>
   But Maine-based Republican consultant David Sparks, a Bush
supporter, said independents pose a strong threat to the Texas
governor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maine will be a contest between the sort of perceived
affection that the state of Maine has had for the Bush family over
the years, and all the establishment lined up behind Bush, versus
Maine voters' demonstrated independence over the years,'' Sparks
said.
</P>
<P>
   US Senator Olympia Snowe of Maine, a Bush supporter, said she
feels ``very positive'' about Bush's chances in Maine, but seemed
less than pleased by his recent appearance at Bob Jones University,
the South Carolina fundamentalist institution.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would have preferred he didn't go to Bob Jones University,''
Snowe said in a telephone interview. Bush's problem, she said, is
that he has ``let others define him. You can't do that in a
political campaign.'' Snowe, a moderate, said she backed Bush early
because she believed he could unify the party and attract voters
across the political spectrum. He needs to return to that message,
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Rhode Island, a heavily Democratic state, could be heavily
influenced by independent voters, who make up 40 percent of the
electorate, while Republicans are only 8 percent. Moreover, Rhode
Island is the most Catholic state in the nation, and Bush's
appearance at Bob Jones University could hurt him there.
</P>
<P>
   Bush aides in Rhode Island said the Bob Jones controversy
doesn't worry them, and they note that McCain could be vulnerable
on a local issue. Unlike Bush, the Arizona senator has not fully
endorsed preserving the Navy's lucrative Seawolf nuclear submarine
program, which provides hundreds of jobs in the Providence area.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from Massachusetts, where the McCain campaign has four
paid staff members, the McCain campaign has little money to spend.
McCain has already spent $2 million on advertising in the Boston
market to reach voters during the New Hampshire primary, so there
is little room left for more spending.
</P>
<P>
   In Maine, state chairman David Emery, a former US House member,
runs the McCain operation from his home with relatively few
resources. He has no cash budget and hardly any supplies. Asked if
he has any bumper stickers, he said, ``I have two.'' A shipment of
1,000 is on the way, however.
</P>
<P>
   On the Democratic side, Vice President Al Gore is ahead in
several states where polls have been taken, including
Massachusetts, Rhode Island, and Connecticut, and appears strong in
the other New England states. The Bradley campaign, however, sees
opportunities across the region, which in theory is an ideal area
for him. If Bradley's effort to appeal to the left wing of the
party can work anywhere, analysts said, it should work in New
England, where independents and liberal Democrats are plentiful.
</P>
<P>
   In Rhode Island, Gore leads Bradley 39 percent to 25 percent in
a Brown University survey completed last week. But the poll also
showed that 36 percent remained undecided. ``Gore has an advantage,
but he hasn't sealed the deal,'' Brown's West said.
</P>
<P>
   Several Bradley supporters bemoaned the rise of McCain because
the Arizona senator appears to be getting the giant's share of
independent voters. Some in the Bradley campaign hope independents
who support McCain will become aware of the Arizona senator's
conservative positions and back Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since'' McCain ``has realized he needs to appeal to
Republicans, he is running around saying `I'm a Reagan Republican,
a Goldwater Republican, I'm opposed to abortion,' and I think
that's a real surprise to a lot of Massachusetts voters,'' said
former Massachusetts attorney general James Shannon, chairman of
Bradley's campaign in the Bay State.
</P>
<P>
   While Bradley trails throughout New England, his aides do see
signs of hope in Connecticut and Rhode Island. A recent Quinnipiac
College poll shows Bradley trailing by just 8 points in
Connecticut, where aides said the former senator is well-organized
and drew large and enthusiastic crowds during a visit earlier this
month.
</P>
<P>
   In Maine, meanwhile, Bradley aides were trumpeting a recent
endorsement by 10 of the state's 18 Democratic state senators, and
held out hope that Bradley could score a win in the state's
nonbinding caucus two days before the primary.
</P>
<P>
   The Gore campaign, while confident throughout New England, knows
the deal must be sealed, and soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think people are waiting to see what is going to happen over
the next 10 days,'' said Alex Zaroulis, a spokeswoman for Gore's
New England campaign. Tuesday's Washington state primary and
Wednesday's California debate are likely to have a major impact on
how the race unfolds in New England.

CAPITAL PUNISHMENT SUPPORTERS CAN CHEER ILLINOIS MORATORIUM
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JEFF JACOBY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   For declaring a moratorium on executions in his state, Illinois
Governor George Ryan is winning high praise from the enemies of
capital punishment. The doyenne of the Washington commentariat,
Mary McGrory, hails him as a ``newly installed hero in the
progressive pantheon'' and quotes a joyful Mario Cuomo: ``This act
was beautiful.''
</P>
<P>
   But it is the supporters of capital punishment, not those who
want it abolished, who owe Ryan a debt of gratitude. As a matter of
morality and logic, the case for the death penalty is unassailable.
It has the added advantage of being popular _ not surprising in a
country that has endured 500,000 murders in the last 25 years. But
all it would take to shatter the public's support for capital
punishment is for a single inmate to be put to death for a murder
he didn't commit.
</P>
<P>
   So far that has never happened. But in Illinois, where several
death row inmates have turned out to be innocent, there have been
some close calls. One man, Anthony Porter, was just two days away
from a lethal injection when his execution was stayed. He was
exonerated last year when the real killer was persuaded to confess
_ not by prosecutors but by a private investigator working with
journalism students at Northwestern University.
</P>
<P>
   That near-horror, plus a Chicago Tribune expose of error and
incompetence in the Cook County criminal justice system, led Ryan
to act. ``I have grave concerns about our state's shameful record
of convicting innocent people and putting them on death row,'' he
said. ``Until I can be sure . . . that no innocent man or woman is
facing lethal injection, no one will meet that fate.''
</P>
<P>
   That is how a pro-capital punishment governor _ and Ryan makes
it clear that he supports the execution of murderers _ should talk.
Convicted killers should die because the worst of all crimes calls
for the worst of all punishments. But because the stakes are so
grave, it also calls for the most exacting due process. When the
state kills a murderer, there must be no doubt about the fairness
of the trial or the integrity of the evidence. And if capital
murder cases in Chicago are as tainted by police or prosecutorial
malfeasance as reports suggest, then it was indeed the
responsibility of Illinois's governor to prevent executions from
going forward. That is why the law empowers him to grant reprieves.
</P>
<P>
   But because something is rotten in the state of Illinois, it
does not follow that there has been a failure of due process
elsewhere. On the contrary, death penalty cases tend to be more
exhaustively scrutinized and litigated than any other kind of
criminal jurisprudence. That is what accounts for the remarkable
accuracy _ yes, accuracy _ of the death penalty in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   For decades, death penalty abolitionists have raised the specter
of wrongful execution. They have pointed to miscarriages of justice
like Anthony Porter's and warned that a state that executes guilty
prisoners will sooner or later execute an innocent one. ``The
danger that innocent people will be executed because of errors in
the criminal justice system is getting worse,'' claims Richard
Dieter of the Death Penalty Information Center, a leading
abolitionist group.
</P>
<P>
   And yet there is still no documented case _ not one _ of an
innocent person being executed in the United States in modern
times.
</P>
<P>
   In a famous 1987 study published in the Stanford Law Review,
Michael Radelet and Hugo Bedau purported to identify 23 instances
in which innocent people had been executed by the state. To this
day, their claim is routinely cited by abolitionists. But when
legal scholars reviewed the Radelet-Bedau study, they reported that
``it consistently presented incomplete and misleading accounts of
the evidence'' in the 23 cases. Eventually Radelet and Bedau
conceded the point. ``We agree with our critics that we have not
proved these executed defendants to be innocent,'' they wrote. ``We
never claimed that we had.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course mistakes are possible. Everything human, including the
criminal law, is fallible. The reason capital punishment has proven
so accurate is not that the judicial system never errs, but that it
anticipates errors and keeps them from becoming fatal. A favorite
statistic of death penalty critics is that ``more than 80'' inmates
have been released from death row since 1973 _ the implication
being that innocent men and women keep coming perilously close to
death.
</P>
<P>
   But in fact the critics understate the case. Of the nearly 6,500
murderers sentenced to death since 1973, more than 2,000 have left
death row by means other than execution. Thirty-three percent of
death penalty verdicts are vacated for one reason or another. A
prisoner on death row is far more likely to leave on his own two
feet than in a box. This reflects the extraordinary level of due
process with which we protect the most dangerous criminals in the
land.
</P>
<P>
   A decent society takes every rational precaution to ensure that
capital punishment is meted out only to the guilty. But to get rid
of capital punishment altogether _ which is what so many of
Governor Ryan's new admirers want _ would be neither decent nor
rational. For when murderers aren't killed, more innocent people
die. In the debate over the death penalty, those are the unchanging
stakes.

CAN BUSH AND GORE WEATHER THE CURRENT POLITICAL STORMS? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROBERT A. JORDAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Before the New Hampshire primary, former US senator Bill Bradley
was being portrayed in the media as a serious threat to
front-runner Vice President Al Gore's bid to be the Democratic
nominee.
</P>
<P>
   At that same time, Arizona Senator John McCain was not taken as
a serious threat to front-runner Texas Governor George Bush's bid
to become the GOP nominee.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the political fortunes of both men appear to have been
reversed.
</P>
<P>
   As recent polls have shown, Gore has been pulling away from
Bradley faster than a rabbit outrunning a hound. And McCain has
become a nightmare for Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Another notable change: Gore is no longer routinely referred to
as ``stiff'' or ``wooden.'' As he widens his lead over Bradley, he
does appear to be looser and more confident. But it may also be
that the now-vulnerable Bush has become the preferred target of
unflattering descriptions.
</P>
<P>
   In politics, however, the more things change, the more they stay
the same.
</P>
<P>
   As challenged and battered as Gore has been, he is still seen as
his party's most likely nominee. And while that is somewhat less
certain for Bush, it may also be true. Although his front-runner
status is under serious attack from McCain, after the March 7 Super
Tuesday primaries he could virtually have the nomination well in
hand.
</P>
<P>
   For example, McCain conceivably could emerge from the March 7
California contest (an open primary) with the most votes. But Bush
could end up with the delegates, since only Republican votes will
be counted to determine who wins the 162 that are up for grabs
there. Bush in recent primaries has done far better than McCain
among Republican voters.
</P>
<P>
   However, if McCain in coming weeks is able to win a few key
primaries and thus win over the GOP establishment, Bush won't be
able to count on California Republicans to back him.
</P>
<P>
   It is conceivable, based on recent polls, that McCain could win
the GOP primary in Massachusetts and a few other states. But if
Bush continues to show that he has strong Republican backing in the
March 7 and March 14 primaries, he is still likely to be nominated
by the GOP establishment. And Bush is still expected to do well in
the gathering of delegates in California and key Southern states
such as Georgia, Missouri, and Maryland.
</P>
<P>
   The GOP establishment is expected to wield strong influence at
the Republican National Convention, and if it still wants Bush, it
will have him as the nominee. The only way McCain could change that
picture is to alter the political landscape during the primaries.
</P>
<P>
   If Bush does not have the necessary 1,034 of 2,066 delegates
needed to win the GOP nomination by the end of March 14, the GOP
convention in July will likely be a tumultuous event.
</P>
<P>
   For Bush to win most of the Republican-only primaries on March 7
and 14, he may have to move further to the right than he would
like. That could come back to haunt him in the fall by giving Gore
ammunition to paint him as a right-winger.
</P>
<P>
   If Gore continues to stay well ahead of Bradley after the March
7 14 primaries, and if core Republicans are able to fend off
McCain's challenge during those two fateful weeks, the outcome of
this primary season will be as many political forecasters predicted
early on.
</P>
<P>
   The political lightning that has energized the McCain campaign
appears to be the only force that can change that forecast. But
Bush's supporters are trying to hold up as many political lightning
rods as possible to protect their candidate from the electrified
McCain campaign.
</P>
<P>
   But the bitter GOP battle between the two candidates could leave
Bush so battered and bruised that it would hinder him in the
November final election against a much less-bruised Gore.
</P>
<P>
   McCain at this stage of the campaign would be a far tougher
opponent for Gore than Bush. Gore and Bush are in a statistical
dead heat in the polls, while McCain would beat Gore by more than
20 points.
</P>
<P>
   Bush supporters are hoping that the McCain surge ebbs as quickly
as it arrived. If Gore and Bush come through their political storms
as winners on March 7 and 14, the convention forecast will still be
a bright sunny week for Gore in Los Angeles and a refreshing breeze
for Bush in Philadelphia.

STUDY CITES LACK OF EMPLOYEE TRAINING EFFORTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KIMBERLY BLANTON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Massachusetts is renowned for universities that educate
the best and brightest in business. But a new study has found that
neither the state nor private companies are doing enough to train
lower-skilled workers and help them move up to take the
higher-level jobs being created by a booming economy.
</P>
<P>
   The lack of training programs for low- and middle-income workers
has also contributed to the gap between their pay, which is
stagnant or declining, and the rising earnings of college graduates
in management or highly technical jobs, according to the report by
MassINC, a Boston think tank. The report was funded by Mellon New
England, a unit of Pittsburgh-based Mellon Financial Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Massachusetts is experiencing a ``quiet crisis,'' said Jack
Donahue, a coauthor of the report and a lecturer at the John F.
Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Sunbelt states with expanding populations, Massachusetts'
population _ and workforce _ barely grew during the 1990s. As a
result, its pool of skilled workers has dried up and its
middle-class has shrunk in the midst of an unprecedented economic
boom.
</P>
<P>
   ``States with lower living costs are doing a better job of
attracting new workers,'' Donahue said, ``so we have to make the
most of every worker we have.''
</P>
<P>
   The labor shortage is a theme that MassINC, which stresses its
nonpartisan agenda, has struck in prior reports. The newest report
attempts to explain the source of the problem: significant gaps in
training people who are employed but need new skills to move into
better jobs that are increasingly reliant on personal computers or
other sophisticated technology.
</P>
<P>
   Massachusetts' community colleges are a key place to educate
workers, but the state's network could do more to reach workers,
the report said.
</P>
<P>
   Some ``commuter colleges,'' notably Middlesex Community College
and Springfield Technical, offer extensive training for adult
workers. Yet, only 1.2 percent of Massachusetts residents are
enrolled in community colleges, compared with 3 percent or more in
California and Illinois.
</P>
<P>
   The report also said Massachusetts government spending ranks
near the bottom for programs to help workers improve their skills
and pay. In a survey of 47 state-funded programs, Massachusetts
ranked 46th with spending of 50 cents per worker, on average, for
skills training in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Employers' own training programs are also lopsided and often
geared to employees at the higher end of the pay scale, according
to US Bureau of Labor Statistics data gathered for the report. For
example, more than half of Massachusetts employers provide advanced
training for their salespeople or computer technicians and
programmers.
</P>
<P>
   A much smaller percentage of employers _ between 18 and 27
percent _ train lower-level workers in clerical, service, or
production jobs who need basic skills such as mathematics or
computer operation.
</P>
<P>
   With the state's unemployment rate at 2.9 percent in January,
companies are under intense pressure to train workers they already
have. Some _ namely Intel Corp., EMC Corp., and Lucent Technologies
Inc. _ work with community colleges to create courses designed to
train workers, said Tom Chmura, vice president of economic
development planning at the University of Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   But, even companies with big training efforts said it is still
extremely difficult to fill empty jobs. Economists believe that a
shortage of skilled workers has crimped the state's growth in
recent months.
</P>
<P>
   Mellon said it funds a 16-week training program for prospective
employees. But the financial company typically has 150 unfilled
positions for accountants of all types and other work because
skilled workers are in such short supply, said spokeswoman Joannie
Jaxtimer.
</P>
<P>
   Chmura said that the state has an interest in helping businesses
train rank-and-file workers. Individual companies' decisions about
which employees will receive training, he said, are based on where
they ``get the best return.'' There is a bigger payoff from
``keeping the software engineer up to date rather than the
entry-level'' employee.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, Massachusetts lawmakers agreed to provide $18
million for a job-training fund in return for reducing the
unemployment insurance tax charged taxpayers.
</P>
<P>
   More could be done, concluded the authors of the MassINC study,
``Opportunity Knocks: Training the Commonwealth's Workers for the
New Economy.'' In addition to Donahue, coauthors were Lisa Lynch,
professor of international economic affairs at Tufts University,
and Ralph Whitehead Jr., professor of public service at the
University of Massachusetts at Amherst.
</P>
<P>
   The study was released with an eye to taking advantage of big
changes in federal job-training legislation that MassINC said could
give Massachusetts more lattitude in designing the next generation
of training programs. In June, the federal Job Training Partnership
Act will expire and be replaced by the new Workforce Investment
Act.
</P>
<P>
   Under WIA, for example, new programs could permit employees to
choose training they feel they need, the study coauthors said. Or,
people who already have jobs could become eligible for training
under WIA. The JTPA job program, now nearly 20 years old, was
largely limited to helping the most marginal or unskilled workers
enter the workforce, sometimes for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   Harneen Chernow, director of education and training for the
AFL-CIO in Massachusetts, said federal funds would not be expanded
when WIA goes into effect, however, setting up a possible
competition among more workers for the same money.

MILITARY PROTECTIVE SUITS MAY BE FAULTY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (w and a coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN M. DONNELLY ASSOCIATED PRESS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Pentagon has alerted US facilities around the
world that hundreds of thousands of protective suits meant to
shield soldiers from gas and germ attack may have holes and other
critical defects, according to military officials and documents.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon learned about the flaws five years ago but did not
consider the problems crucial and needed the gear for US
peacekeeping troops in Bosnia, criminal investigators said. Not
until late last year did a second study on the same suits find
identical flaws grave enough to warrant a global warning, the
investigators said.
</P>
<P>
   On Feb. 9, the Pentagon cautioned commanders not to use any of
the 778,000 suits except in training. The suits, not all of which
are defective, cost the government almost $49 million.
</P>
<P>
   The defects included ``cuts, holes, embedded foreign matter and
stitching irregularities,'' the Pentagon inspector general said in
a report being released this week. The defects potentially could
kill people wearing the trousers and jackets in a
``chemical-biological contaminated environment,'' the report said.
</P>
<P>
   A bankrupt New York City-based company, which the inspector
general identified as Istratex, produced the charcoal-lined
camouflage suits under two contracts dating from 1989. Soldiers
wear the suits over their regular camouflage gear where chemical or
biological weapons might be used. It was unclear whether any of the
suits were worn by troops in the 1990-91 Desert Shield-Desert Storm
operation, when Iraqi chemical attack was considered likely.
</P>
<P>
   Last September, Istratex's president and production manager
pleaded guilty in US District Court in New York to one count of
making false statements. Other officials were charged with
obstruction of justice and making false certificates or writing.
They had been charged with conspiracy to defraud the government,
major fraud, and false claims.
</P>
<P>
   Pentagon criminal investigators said they pointed out to the
Defense Logistics Agency, which manages inventories, problems with
some of the ``battle-dress overgarments'' in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, the agency's testers, at the investigators' request,
studied 500 of the suits and found defects in 174, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The Defense Logistics Agency identified the problems as major
but not ``safety-of-life critical defects,'' said Mitchell Schlitt,
the case agent for the inspector general's Defense Criminal
Investigative Service in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``So because of a need for these suits for the Bosnia action,
they stated a need to retain these in stock,'' Schlitt said.
</P>
<P>
   Three years later, last September, the criminal investigators
asked for new tests, this time by Army designers of the suit,
Schlitt said. Examining the same suits, the new team found the
defects were in fact critical.
</P>
<P>
   By regulation, Schlitt said, a critical defect, unlike a major
one, is so severe that finding one such problem in a single suit
warrants stopping use of the entire lot.
</P>
<P>
   According to the military standard, a critical flaw is one that
``would result in hazardous or unsafe conditions or . . . is likely
to prevent performance of the tactical function.'' By comparision,
the official standard says a major defect is not much better: It is
``likely to result in failure or to reduce materially the usability
of the . . . product.''
</P>
<P>
   The Istratex executives pleaded guilty to prosecution
allegations that the company intentionally manufactured faulty
gear, then duped government inspectors by clandestinely switching
small quantities of well-made garments for flawed ones during
inspections. Sentencing is set for April, and the executives face
jail terms and fines.
</P>
<P>
   The investigators examined suits only from one contract for
173,000 suits. The second contract covered the remaining
approximately 605,000 suits, but the prosecutors did not examine
those. Still, the Pentagon's alert warns US forces that defective
suits might be found among all 778,000 made under the two deals.
</P>
<P>
   James Kornides, the top auditor on the case, believes many of
the suits were deployed to far-flung places. ``That's why we wanted
them to . . . alert the operational units that those suits could be
defective,'' he said.

   SOMERVILLE, Mass. _ In the fourth collection of poetry Douglas
Holder has published at his Ibbetson Street Press here, he includes
a poem of his own, titled ``A Simple Nod.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(poetry style) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I saw him walking in Harvard Square,
</P>
<P>
   happily walking with a friend.
</P>
<P>
   As we passed each other
</P>
<P>
   we exchanged a simple, understated nod.
</P>
<P>
   Our silence was a friendly conspiracy
</P>
<P>
   a reminder of where he once was
</P>
<P>
   and where he was,
</P>
<P>
   now.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(end poetry style) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The where is never stated _ although two words, ``the ward,'' a
few lines further on provide a hint. Holder, 44, is a mental health
counselor, and for the past six years he has been conducting poetry
workshops at McLean Hospital in Belmont for its patients.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd been working there 17 years, and I'd had my poetry
published in small journals,'' he says. ``I wanted to add another
dimension to my job and help a few folks out.''
</P>
<P>
   While Holder would not think of ranking himself with Anne
Sexton, who won the Pulitzer Prize for poetry in 1967, he does
invoke the legendary poetry workshops she conducted at McLean in
the late 1960s. Sexton, a patient at the Belmont hospital in 1973,
committed suicide in October 1974.
</P>
<P>
   Nor does Holder claim that the hospital today resembles the
institution of those years. ``It's not like the old McLean's,'' he
says, ``with patrician types sitting around drinking tea from bone
china.'' That was the McLean of Harvard fullbacks, Porcellian Club
members, and ``Mayflower screwballs.'' That was the McLean that
Robert Lowell, a frequent patient there in the 1950s, memorialized
in his poem ``Waking in the Blue,'' and that Cambridge writer
Susanna Kaysen, a patient in 1967, recalls in her best-selling
memoir, ``Girl, Interrupted,'' now a major motion picture.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Holder says, the members of his poetry groups are more
likely to be the homeless, ``coming in with a bit of doggerel.''
</P>
<P>
   He runs two workshops, one on Thursday afternoons for patients
in the hospital's open-ward program, which meets in a converted
Victorian mansion, and the other on Friday evenings for patients on
the two locked wards where Holder works. Neither is open to an
outside visitor.
</P>
<P>
   But whether in the mansion or in the more institutional setting
of the locked ward, Holder says, ``I try to have sort of a
coffeehouse atmosphere. We'll have a round of applause when someone
reads a poem.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, it doesn't always work out as planned.
</P>
<P>
   Holder remembers reading Allen Ginsberg's ``Howl'' at his very
first workshop.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was pretty enthusiastic then, and a bit naive,'' he says.
``I thought they'd like it. I saw the poem _ with its lament about
`the best minds of his generation lost to madness' _ as a haunting
cry that would be a catalyst for a discussion.''
</P>
<P>
   And, he says, with some self-deprecation, ``I thought they'd
think of me as, `Hey, this guy knows where I'm coming from.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, ``they were angry and one of them walked out,'' he
says. ``And one of them told me: `Why do I have to hear this? I
live that life.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Another time, Holder says, a young woman became hysterical and
ran out when he read a poem of his own about a kosher butcher in
Brookline.
</P>
<P>
   ``It turned out that the young woman had a painful experience in
her life, which she associated with chickens, and she couldn't take
it,'' Holder says. ``I had a lot of explaining to do with the
clinical staff.
</P>
<P>
   ``You never know,'' he adds, ``when you might hit a vein.''
</P>
<P>
   That problem is compounded, Holder says, by the fact that
today's hospital stays tend to be shorter _ a week or two instead
of several months. ``You don't always know what to expect,'' he
says.
</P>
<P>
   It also means that the workshops aren't quite the institutions
they were in Sexton's day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I get in their face about it,'' Holder says. ``I'll go around
to the rooms on my wards and ask: `Are you coming to the poetry
group tonight?'
</P>
<P>
   ``And sometimes, I'll have a doctor or another staff person tell
me that so-and-so is a well-known writer, so I'll make a special
effort to get them to come.''
</P>
<P>
   A number of poems written by patients in these workshops have
been published _ usually anonymously _ in the now-defunct Boston
Poet and other small poetry magazines. But not in his own magazine,
which shares the name of his small press, Holder says, because that
would violate hospital policy.
</P>
<P>
   Because he believes that poetry can play a healing role, Holder
started Ibbetson Street Press out of his house in Somerville _
naming it after the street where he lives with his wife, Diane
Robitaille, a poet and geriatric nurse.
</P>
<P>
   Holder, who got a master's degree in literature from Harvard's
extension school while working at McLean, had been publishing his
poetry in small magazines and especially in Spare Change, the
monthly journal for the homeless. ``I write a lot about
homelessness and mental health problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Starting a small press to publish local poets, Holder says, was
``a way to get connected.''
</P>
<P>
   The most recent issue _ 38 pages on 8 1/2-by-11 paper with a
paper cover, bound with a black slip-on plastic binder _ sells for
$4 and contains 40 poems; an interview with Ed Galings, an elderly
small-press poet; and several reviews.
</P>
<P>
   Among the poets are a number of first-time writers and others
described as ``mainstays'' of Holder's press. There are also two
professors of literature _ John Hildebidle, who teaches at MIT, and
Robert K. Johnson, who teaches at Suffolk University _ as well as
Don Divecchio, the poetry editor of Spare Change.
</P>
<P>
   Ibbetson Street Press has also published a number of chapbooks,
an old English term for a small collection of poems or ballads,
most recently ``Poems From 42nd Street'' by Rufus Goodwin, a poet
and journalist who lives in Boston; and a collection called ``Poems
for the Poet, the Working Man and the Downtrodden,'' by A. D.
Winans, who publishes a small poetry magazine in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   ``What distinguishes our journal,'' says Holder, ``is that it
contains poems that anyone can read.'' They deal ``with everyday
life. There's not a lot of arcane words or funny verse patterns.''
Anyone, he adds, ``can get something out of them.''

NEW CD IS PURE, NO-FRILLS STEELY DAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE MORSE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Carlos Santana launched his comeback last year by using a fleet
of famous guest stars, many of them young, on his ``Supernatural''
album. No doubt more aging boomers will do the same _ but an
exception is Steely Dan, whose first studio album in 20 years keeps
it all in the family. The two official members of Steely Dan _
Walter Becker and Donald Fagen _ steer their own course, while
using non-big-name backup musicians with whom they've worked for a
long time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never really liked the idea of cameo performances,'' says
Becker, referring to various ``star'' turns. ``In most instances,
they destroy the illusion of the work as originating from some
particular point of its own. They sort of dilute things a little
bit.''
</P>
<P>
   Diluting things is popular in today's fractured marketplace,
where artists often try to reach as many radio formats as possible
by importing stars to get them there. But Steely Dan has always
been in it for art, not fame, which helps explain the title of its
new CD, ``Two Against Nature,'' due Tuesday. In honor of the CD
release, PBS will telecast ``In the Spotlight: Steely Dan'' on
Friday at 9 p.m. Steely Dan may also do a summer shed tour.
</P>
<P>
   The album showcases its cerebral jazz-pop sound, cut with
elegant doses of rock and funk, stitched together with luminous,
and often wonderfully cynical, lyrics. All of which, in further
explaining the ``Two Against Nature'' title, is Steely Dan's
attempt to fight ``the way that life and human nature tend to
settle for mediocrity, and how the aging process brings out various
fears or a sense of timidity,'' Becker says.
</P>
<P>
   No one else sounds like Steely Dan, whose last original album
was 1980's ``Gaucho.'' Becker and Fagen then took a break from each
other, before touring successfully in the '90s. But though they
each released solo albums in the past decade, they took their time
with a new disc because they didn't want to return with a
half-baked effort.
</P>
<P>
   The new album marks a seamless transition from earlier Steely
Dan records, updated with digital audio and grown-up lyrical
themes. But there's no Puff Daddy collaboration or other hip-hop
nods, no departure into techno, no basic change of instruments.
Guitars (Becker), keyboards (Fagen), and bass, drums, and horns are
still featured, as they always were. &QL; 
 &QL; 
No radical departure &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``We talked about all sorts of ways of conceiving the album _ of
using various themes or experimental approaches or weird
instrumentations,'' says Becker. ``We talked about stuff that would
have been radical departures from what we'd done in the past, but
in the end we just didn't go that way. And I think it was a good
call.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Steely Dan's breezy jazz-flavored pop, no one else is
``getting away with it these days,'' Becker admits with a laugh.
``But we've always been interested in that kind of music. When I
was a kid, I was always astounded at the lack of greater acceptance
for jazz music in America. I'd say that all these years later, it's
only gotten worse. It's just something that Don and I have always
related to as sort of our primary source of musical roots, if you
will. It's just not part of the mainstream of the American musical
culture at this point.''
</P>
<P>
   The new album reflects the oblique, crazy-quilt world view
shared by Becker and Fagen, ever since they were in Bard College in
the late 1960s. Even the choice of the name Steely Dan was an
eccentric one, since it stands for a phallic prop in the William
Burroughs novel, ``Naked Lunch.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
Songs still off-center &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The group has enjoyed a number of left-of-center hits through
the years (``Deacon Blues,'' ``Black Friday,'' and ``Josie,'' to
name a few) and has more likable oddities on the new disc. The
funky ``Cousin Dupree'' is a picaresque tale of someone who has
``played a lot of nowhere gigs from keyboard man in a rockin' ska
band to haulin' boss crude in big rigs.'' And ``Almost Gothic'' is
about an infatuation with a woman who is ``pure science with a
splash of black cat. . . . She's almost gothic and I like it like
that.'' The protagonist concludes, ``I'm so excited I can barely
cope / I'm sizzling like an isotope.''
</P>
<P>
   Rhyming cope with isotope? You might call it a typical Steely
Dan invention.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, well, we got a chuckle out of that one, too,'' says
Becker. ``That's why we work together, essentially, because we're
stimulating to one another's creative impulses.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the musical end of the writing, he and Fagen tend to work
separately, then bring in their bits to ``thrash them out.'' But
for lyrics, ``most were written with both of us in the same room
with our thesauruses and computers and other aids.''
</P>
<P>
   Thesauruses?
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure, rhyming dictionaries, thesauruses, why not?''
</P>
<P>
   Offbeat lyrics abound, including the instantly classic line in
the horn-flecked ``Janie Runaway'' that ``you be the showgirl and
I'll be Sinatra way back in '59.'' But poignant lyrical twists also
arise in a number of songs, as in ``What a Shame About Me'' (a funk
tune about a failed novelist who is ``three weeks out of the rehab,
living one day at a time'') and ``West of Hollywood,'' about a man
who is ``way deep into nothing special.'' The man meets a potential
lover and tells her, ``Look in my eyes / Can't you see the core is
frozen? You can't ask me to access the dreams I don't have now.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We wrote many more songs than what we actually recorded,''
says Becker, ``and we were able to write songs that reflected where
we actually are in life and in our careers and in relation to the
world at this point in time _ without being really
autobiographical.''
</P>
<P>
   Becker and Fagen, who played with many of the members of their
touring band in the studio, worked for 22 months straight to finish
the album. That's the hardest-working run of any of their albums,
all because ``we were trying to meet a standard, or exceed a
standard of work, that we had been able to accomplish in the
past.''
</P>
<P>
   In more practical terms, it's also because they knew they had to
complete it in time for a tour this spring and summer. And touring
is what pleases Steely Dan as much as anything these days. They
used to hate it in the '70s (``we've moaned at length about that
already,'' says Becker) and went 19 years before starting up again
in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Why so cheery about touring today?
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, we have a band that is consistent night to night, and is
fun to play with,'' says Becker. ``The venues are also nicer and
the travel is much better organized. And we actually make money
doing it, as opposed to losing money in the '70s. The road is a
whole new thing for us now.''

<P>
   !!! ``Judy Berlin'' A stylish debut from former Woody Allen
assistant Eric Mendelssohn. His black-and-white take on suburban
angst takes it easy on suburbia and is compassionate to his
screenful of characters zombieing through its streets, looking for
love. (Unrated) &QL; 
 &QL; 
!!! 1/2 ``The Life and Times of Hank Greenberg'' Fascinating and
richly textured documentary about baseball's first Jewish
superstar, who bashed homers and RBIs with the best of them in the
1930s and '40s for the Detroit Tigers and wore the mantle of Jewish
role model with grace and dignity. &QL; 
 &QL; 
!! ``Reindeer Games'' Half heist thriller, half noir in which
clever plot revelations and resourceful acting labor against
cheeseball dialogue as Ben Affleck's recently sprung car thief is
strong-armed into a casino robbery by Charlize Theron's bad-news
sexpot. (R) &QL; 
 &QL; 
!!!! ``The Wonder Boys'' Deliciously quirky comedy of campus
upheaval, set in motion when Michael Douglas's aging wonder boy, a
lit prof who's afraid to finish his second novel, meets a gifted
student and new wonder boy, played by a quietly compelling Tobey
Maguire as a raw talent with considerable literary skills and no
social skills. (R) &QL; 
 &QL; 
! 1/2 ``The Beach'' It must have seemed a cool idea to Leonardo
DiCaprio to make a neo-hippie movie with the ``Trainspotting''
gang. But his blissed-out backpacker seems a twit without
qualities, redeeming or otherwise. He leaves everything and
everybody worse off and throws to the winds any chance of dramatic
credibility when he does a Marlon Brando ``Apocalypse Now'' parody
in the jungle. ``Beach Blanket Bingo'' did it better than this
candidate for all-time spring-break-bummer movie. (R) &QL; 
 &QL; 
!! ``The Big Tease'' Sunny but slight mockumentary in which a
Scottish hairdresser (Craig Ferguson) throws himself at the LA
styling establishment so he can make his mark in its Big Hair
Olympics. Easy to take, but innocuous. The best thing in it is
Frances Fisher, as a public-relations live wire who's charmed out
of a bad hair day and decides to help plug the newcomer into the
system. (R) &QL; 
 &QL; 
!! 1/2 ``Boiler Room'' This would-be ``Wall Street'' update, which
also genuflects to ``Glengarry Glen Ross,'' carries you along on
the rush of the collective energy of a roomful of young hotshots
getting rich selling worthless stocks. Its MTV-style breathlessness
subsides long before the end, but not before Giovanni Ribisi
impresses as a smart go-getter and Vin Diesel gets to us as one
with heart. (R) &QL;

MADONNA: STILL EXPRESSING HERSELF 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOAN ANDERMAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Madonna is curled up on the sofa in a plush hotel
room in Manhattan. She is totally and completely in her element,
doing what she does second-best to being Madonna _ that is, talking
about being Madonna. She is also in an unavoidably strange
position: chatting politely and smiling sweetly for people who will
probably be tearing her limb from limb in the coming weeks. But she
has come to expect this. Thick-skinned adventuress that she is,
Madonna keeps making movies.
</P>
<P>
   Her new film _ ``The Next Best Thing,'' a romantic dramedy in
which Madonna stars with her real-life best friend, Rupert Everett
_ opens Friday. And so, the 41-year-old icon is gamely discussing
everything from her psyche to her underwear. She is thrilled to
learn that the reporter is a music writer rather than a film
critic. The reporter is thrilled that there is no trace of the
horrid English accent Madonna often trots out for public
consumption. She fusses incessantly with her watch; it's the only
tic in her otherwise serene demeanor. Her hair _ perhaps the most
consistent barometer of Madonna's morphing incarnations _ falls in
golden, unfussy waves over her shoulders.
</P>
<P>
   This is Madonna, circa 2000: Cabala Devotee. Yoga Student. Very
Strict Mommy. She is tinier and lovelier and funnier than you'd
expect. Her bra is famously exposed under a striped silk shirt;
it's exquisite, covered in black crystals and beads, and probably
cost more than the reporter's entire pathetic outfit. This
realization is tempered by the even more startling observation that
the skin on Madonna's heels, poking daintily through the rear of
her spike-heeled patent-leather slingbacks, is dry and cracked.
Regular Girl Alert. Is it possible that Madonna really isn't so
different from Abbie after all?
</P>
<P>
   Abbie is the regular girl Madonna plays in ``The Next Best
Thing,'' which follows the comic/tragic lives of a straight woman
and gay man who conceive a child one depressed, cocktail-saturated
afternoon and decide to become a family. Abbie is meticulous,
self-absorbed, and love-challenged. Robert (Everett's character) is
witty, charming, and love-challenged. They are best friends. It
sounds, and is, like a not-so-distant cinematic cousin to ``My Best
Friend's Wedding,'' another gay-confidant movie starring Everett
and Julia Roberts. It also sounds like real life. Indeed, the
production notes prepared by Paramount quote the actress as saying
that she ``can totally relate to the idea of getting to a certain
age and not feeling like I had met my soulmate and being in a state
of panic about having a child.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
On Abbie and motherhood &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, you can't believe everything you read. ``No, I don't
really identify with Abbie,'' says Madonna matter-of-factly. She is
nearly always matter-of-fact, even when contradicting herself.
``When I decided I wanted to have a baby, I was in a relationship
(now defunct, with then-personal trainer Carlos Leon) and I was in
love. So it wasn't like I had a panic attack or anything.''
</P>
<P>
   There is much more about Madonna's portrayal of Abbie that seems
misrepresented. But let's leave that to the film critics. There are
certain undeniable parallels. Abbie has miserable luck in love. So
has Madonna. ``I've made some mistakes,'' she says. ``Definitely. I
think I've passed some pretty incredible people by because I was
really selfish and whatever. I'm still kicking myself.'' And then
there are the so-called men who simply couldn't handle hitching
their wagon to the superstar express. ``I've found myself in
situations with men where, like Abbie, I've said, `Wait a second.
You mean if I had less to offer you I'd have a better chance in
this relationship?' There have been many situations where my
accomplishments and success have actually hindered the relationship
from taking place.''
</P>
<P>
   Abbie has a young child. So has Madonna. Of course, the two
navigate totally different parenting scenarios. Abbie solves the
child-care dilemma by letting her son Sam help out at the reception
counter in her yoga studio; Madonna solves the child-care dilemma
by enrolling 3-year-old Lourdes, whom she calls Lola, in four
preschools _ in London, New York, Miami, and LA. She has a nanny,
too. But motherhood has a way of leveling the playing field no
matter what the tax bracket or celebrity quotient.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to be honest, there are times when I just go, `uh, I
can't do that because of my daughter.' I've turned down a lot of
things. I've given up going on world tours,'' Madonna announces,
bringing into bold relief the notion that sacrifice is very much a
relative thing. ``I don't want to make a movie where she couldn't
go to school. And I want to make sure that she and her father have
a regular and steady relationship. That's very, very important.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
Balancing act &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The woman whose singular moniker could so recently be given as
the antonym for compromise feels, it would seem, as if she's made
one. ``Yeah, sometimes it does feel like that. I've given up a lot.
But,'' she adds, ``nothing compares to the rewards. I think I'm
just not as ambitious. Before, I said yes to everything. I want to
do this, I want to do that. I'll make a record, then do a movie,
I'll do this, I'll do that. You know I just can't do it. I can't do
it. I can't do that and have a relationship with my daughter. So I
just pass.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, don't expect Blonde Ambition Part 2. The quest
for notoriety won't be the defining feature of Madonna's future
that it was during the first decade of her career. (Although she's
adamant that having a child hasn't changed her feelings about
sexual and religious content in art: ``There's no way to avoid it;
it's a big part of be-
</P>
<P>
   ing a human being.'') She and Lola, who was baptized a Catholic
even though her mother is not at all sure how she feels about
organized religion, say their prayers together every night before
she goes to bed. These days Madonna gravitates more toward women
with children because ``you can pick their brains and complain with
them.'' Not that she's given up gay men, who constitute the bulk of
her social circle. Madonna expects to have another couple of years
of the good gypsy life and then ``throw down the anchor,'' for
Lola's sake, probably in New York.
</P>
<P>
   But let's not confuse ambition with determination. Take
Madonna's film career, which at its most promising presented her as
variations of herself (the sassy, streetwise title character in
``Desperately Seeking Susan'' and the powerful cultural matriarch
in ``Evita'') and at its worst (``Who's That Girl?'' and ``Shanghai
Surprise,'' a true-blue debacle made with Sean Penn, her husband
from 1985 to 1989) was bad enough to put a stake through the heart
of a lesser icon's dreams. Madonna, being Madonna, perseveres.
Critics be damned. She wants to be an actress.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the creative impulse has to come from a selfish
place,'' is how she explains her willingness to keep returning _
perpetually smarting from the last bout _ to the ring. ``I don't
think you can begin by thinking how it's going to affect other
people. I do the best that I can possibly do, because that's the
only chance I'm going to have when it comes to audience reaction.''
</P>
<P>
   Her chances with critics, she believes, are essentially
nonexistent. Madonna is rarely if ever, as far as she's concerned,
given a fair shake in the press. Suddenly her civil tone of voice
seems a supreme act of will. She folds her hands in her lap.
``Anybody who's successful in one area is given a much harder time
if they try to go into another area. It's very begrudging. Instead
of going `OK. God bless you,' everyone's like `let's just see if
this can happen.' You'd think people would be more encouraging
about it, about people being adventurous. But no. No.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
Motivational matters &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It seems the right moment to shift the discussion toward
something more inspirational, such as where on earth Madonna finds
her motivation _ how she stays hungry in her head _ sitting on top
of the world? The question is accompanied by a coughing fit. The
reporter asks politely for a glass of water.
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' Madonna says. ``You have to choke.'' She is
matter-of-fact even when she is being humorous. ``That's what you
get for asking such a provocative question.''
</P>
<P>
   And yet she thinks about this for a good long time. ``I guess,''
she says slowly, and the rest of the words come haltingly, ``it's
all got to do with the way I perceive myself. I always feel, to
this day, no matter where I've been and what I've done, I always
see myself as this kind of insecure girl from the Midwest who
doesn't know very much and has so much to learn and so far to go
and so much to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Madonna's music, and the stream of mesmerizing musical personas
she's created over the last 15 years, feeds off that insatiable
hunger to prove herself. The pitch of Madonna's speaking voice
rises when she starts talking about her new album, which she's
recording in London with electronica guru William Orbit, who
produced 1998's Grammy-winning ``Ray of Light.'' The new music
isn't as dreamy and ethereal as her last album, Madonna says,
although it's still immersed in electronics. ``It's much more
stripped-down and minimal, and edgier-sounding.'' Also working on
new tracks is Mir Wais, a French songwriter and producer who hit
the jackpot _ to say the least _ when he sent an unsolicited demo
to Madonna's record company, Maverick.
</P>
<P>
   ``I heard it and I was like, `Oh my God! I gotta work with this
guy.' He comes from that whole French electronic world. He's a
genius, a real visionary, and I'm so honored to be working with
him.''
</P>
<P>
   So there's music, and movies, a new David Hare play that she's
interested in, and her beloved child. She'd like another. Madonna
has a boyfriend _ 31-year-old British director Guy Ritchie (``Lock,
Stock and Two Smoking Barrels''). She'd rather not jinx it by
discussing him. No, she's not pregnant, as the rumor mills have
been declaring the past few months. Life for Madonna _ she's the
first to admit that this is an understatement _ is full. ``I never
know what to write when I'm filling out the card on the airplane,''
she laughs. So does the reporter. It's hard to imagine Madonna
filling out the card on the airplane. ``Sometimes I write singer,
sometimes I write actress, sometimes I write mother. It depends on
the mood I'm in. Lately, I write entertainer, and I feel like that
sort of covers all the areas.''
</P>
<P>
   There must, it seems, be a singular goal, a galvanizing sense of
purpose, that set her on this remarkable trajectory. If there's one
quality that defines Madonna, it's strength. But what, exactly, is
the nature of that strength? ``I don't know,'' Madonna says after a
long silence. ``Ask some other people.'' She sighs. She scans the
walls of the hotel room. She wants to answer this question.
Finally, she lets her gaze settle straight ahead. ``I'm
insatiable.''

ON A WING AND A PRAYER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DON AUCOIN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a scene from ``The Muppet Movie,'' Kermit the Frog and Fozzie
Bear are tooling down the highway, bound for Hollywood, when they
spot an oversized yellow fowl waddling toward them.
</P>
<P>
   It's none other than Big Bird, who (in the movie's plot conceit)
is an unknown, not yet the winged embodiment of the Public
Broadcasting Service. Offered a ride, Big Bird trills: ``No thanks.
I'm on my way to New York City to try to break into public
television.'' A dubious Fozzie wishes him luck.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Pat Mitchell, a onetime Boston TV reporter who
became a documentary producer and CNN executive, will break into
public television _ at the top. Mitchell will need loads of luck to
go along with her undeniable skill, because as the first woman
president of PBS, she inherits a system facing what one of her
predecessors, Lawrence Grossman, calls ``horrendous challenges.''
</P>
<P>
   PBS ``has to redefine itself in a major way,'' warns Grossman,
or ``be left for roadkill on the information highway.''
</P>
<P>
   Granted, it seems as if public television is always in crisis;
PBS is a political football that's been kicked around Capitol Hill
for years, especially during appropriations time.
</P>
<P>
   But friend and foe alike agree that this is a particularly dicey
time for PBS. The telecommunications revolution of the past few
years has chipped away at the very rationale for the existence of
public broadcasting, while measurably weakening PBS's hold on
viewers.
</P>
<P>
   According to Nielsen Media Research, there's been a 20 percent
drop in audience since the mid-1980s, and the average PBS program
draws fewer than two million households _ one-tenth the audience
that tuned in for that ennobling TV milestone, Fox's ``Who Wants to
Marry a Multimillionaire?''
</P>
<P>
   For a system always vulnerable to charges that it serves only a
narrow slice of America, those are ominously low numbers. ``If
there were no PBS today, you wouldn't have to create it,'' asserts
Robert Lichter, head of the Center for Media and Public Affairs, a
Washington-based research group.
</P>
<P>
   Small wonder that a whiff of desperation comes from PBS these
days. Most telling example: Beset by funding pressures that make
merchandising spinoffs more important than ever to the bottom line,
the system that gave us ``Sesame Street'' and ``Arthur'' lowered
its standards to make room for . . . ``Teletubbies.''
</P>
<P>
   ``PBS is trusted by the public. They're supposed to be a special
station; they're not supposed to take advantage of children,'' says
Dr. Alvin Poussaint, clinical professor of psychiatry at Harvard
Medical School and a consultant on the Nickelodeon program ``Little
Bill.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But the need for money has escalated without a significant
increase in the funds they have available to them,'' says
Poussaint, insisting that Congress must shoulder some of the blame.
``Now, when they start developing programs for children, they have
to think about merchandising toys as a way to bring money into
their coffers.''
</P>
<P>
   Internally, many of PBS's 350 member stations are rebelling
against the parent organization's central control at a time when
unity is needed to coordinate the expenditure of billions of
dollars on the transition to digital technology. (That costly shift
will intensify PBS's funding woes). Some affiliates want to control
their own schedules _ in other words, preempt PBS programs for
profit-generating local specials. ``Their feeling is `I want to do
it my way,' '' says Peggy Charren, founder of Action for Children's
Television and a staunch supporter of PBS. ``They really don't want
to be part of a network.''
</P>
<P>
   Grossman, PBS president from 1976 to 1984, says the system is
also bedeviled by ``a lot of these bureaucratic turf battles (that)
end up seriously affecting the quality of what gets on the air.''
CNN's Jeff Greenfield, host of a new series of finance shows airing
on PBS, agrees that the system is ``all wrapped up in fights over
power and money.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not that they don't do good stuff,'' says Greenfield.
``But the thing I hear from people in public broadcasting is
frustration with the pace of movement, the decision-making process,
the fiefdoms.''
</P>
<P>
   Frustration with PBS is not confined to insiders. The system is
under increasing attack for succumbing to commercialism by airing
``underwriting messages'' that bear a suspicious resemblance to
plain old TV commercials, and for deferring to corporate interests
with business-friendly programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``PBS has to move out of the business of selling audiences to
advertisers, get corporate influence out of the decision-making
process, and move away from commercialism and sterile insiderism,''
says William Hoynes of Vassar College, author of several studies on
PBS. ``They need to focus on their founding mission of connecting
to the public in ways that view the public as citizens, not just as
audiences.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, from the right, the old charge of liberal bias _
which had begun to dissipate _ sprang back to life when the GOP-led
Congress discovered last year that PBS affiliates, including
Boston's WGBH-TV (Channel 2), were swapping membership lists with
mostly Democratic organizations.
</P>
<P>
   But the underlying problem facing PBS is one that all
broadcasters are grappling with: that viewers, diverted by the
shiny baubles glittering on the cable side of the dial, are
steadily drifting away. Since PBS starts from a much smaller base
than ABC or CBS or NBC, every nosebleed has hemorrhage potential.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dealing with the Republicans is the easy part,'' says Lichter.
``Dealing with a 500-channel universe is the hard part. And
commercial television has developed an upscale division.''
</P>
<P>
   It's true. Everywhere PBS turns, it now finds an interloper
occupying ground to which it once laid virtually exclusive claim.
For instance, PBS once stood alone in offering high-quality,
educational children's programs. But Nickelodeon now boasts an
equally impressive lineup, with The Disney Channel coming on
strong. Even ABC is investing heavily in kids' fare.
</P>
<P>
   Serious documentaries? They're just a click away, on The History
Channel or CNN. Science? The Discovery Channel. A little something
for the culture vultures? The Bravo channel. Odes to our
four-legged friends? The Animal Planet channel. Public affairs
programs? Get real: Issues are masticated within an inch of their
lives on MSNBC, Fox News Channel, or CNN. Dramatic fare? The A&AMP;E
Network and TNT serve up plenty, and the most talked-about dramatic
program of the past year, ``The Sopranos,'' came from HBO.
</P>
<P>
   Mitchel will have none of it. As she takes over the leadership
of PBS, she is adamant that while ``there are cable networks that
do some similar kinds of genre programming . . . what PBS does is
unique and distinctive and different.''
</P>
<P>
   It's true that few other networks can match the consistent
quality of ``The American Experience,'' ``NOVA,'' or Ken Burns's
epic documentaries. ``The NewsHour with Jim Lehrer,'' ``Masterpiece
Theater,'' and ``Mystery!'' have passionate followings. Big Bird
and the rest of the gang still make ``Sesame Street'' a TV address
where learning is fun.
</P>
<P>
   And it's hard not to sympathize with PBS. The system is held _
and holds itself _ to a higher standard than the broadcast and
cable networks with which it competes. PBS is operating in a
marektplace that does not reward _ indeed, that penalizes _ classy
restraint. On balance, PBS remains, in the words of Marvin Kalb,
``an oasis of tasteful calm in a continuing storm of
commercially-driven pressures and programming.''
</P>
<P>
   But there is such a thing as being too calm. As HBO and Showtime
have muscled into the arena with ambitious, contemporary dramas
like ``The Sopranos,'' ``Sex and The City,'' and ``Beggars and
Choosers,'' PBS has allowed itself to still be associated in the
public mind with stuffy, British-accented period pieces.
</P>
<P>
   With so many options available to viewers, PBS needs to take
more chances and create more buzz about its programs.
</P>
<P>
   Yet even while facing this urgent challenge, PBS has languished
without a permanent chief of programming _ the key link to the
``creative community'' of producers, writers, and actors _ for
nearly a year. Mitchell herself wasn't hired until four months
after her immediate predecessor, Ervin Duggan, resigned. Those are
symptoms of a system in stasis.
</P>
<P>
   The good news for PBS aficionados is that Mitchell seems ideally
suited to provide the shot of institutional adrenaline the system
needs. Traditionalists will like the fact that she speaks fervently
of PBS's commitment to ``education and outreach and public
service.'' The innovators may be pleased that with three decades of
experience in commercial television, and as the first TV producer
ever to head PBS, Mitchell will bring a set of pragmatic skills
that may equip the system better to operate in the rough-and-tumble
arena that is contemporary television.
</P>
<P>
   A top priority is hiring a programming chief. Says Mitchell: ``I
want to make sure the creative community thinks of us first, that
when they want to do their very best work, their most impactful
work . . . that they're going to think first about coming to PBS.''
</P>
<P>
   The challenge that will define Pat Mitchell's tenure, and PBS's
future, is whether she can find a way to get viewers to do the same
thing.

AUTHOR INTRODUCES AN ALMOST PERFECT `FOOL' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL G. PRAGER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
FOOL 
By Frederick G. Dillen 
Algonquin Books of Chapel Hill, 302 pp., $23.95 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The guy who said that ``nobody loves a fool but his mother''
never met Barnaby Griswold.
</P>
<P>
   That he has been a fool all his life is not in question; it's
one of the first things Barnaby knew about himself. And the
evidence of his life has supported the conclusion: He never quite
connected with his folks, his marriage was loveless, and when he
not only lost his livelihood but was humiliated in the process, his
daughters showed they cared more about his money than about him.
</P>
<P>
   But Barnaby Griswold, so much the fool that Gloucester, Mass.
author Frederick G. Dillen names his new novel after this trait, is
undeniably lovable, even if it is a feeling that begins in
sympathy. Dillen introduces his character near the end of the
finals of the Winott Point tennis club championship, and Barnaby's
prospects appear bleak. He has never been much of an athlete, but
his suspension from the securities business has given him time to
get in shape. It has been a foolish goal, to win the trophy,
because even if he wins, his losses will be complete by the end of
the day. The divorce decree says he must leave Winott Point, a
North Shore Yankee enclave where he spent summers growing up, by
midnight. He's left friendless, jobless, loveless, and now
homeless.
</P>
<P>
   Slowly, his fortunes in the match turn, almost in spite of
himself, and he does indeed emerge victorious. But with no one in
the crowd to play for, to share his win with, it is a hollow
victory. His fantasy of donning his championship pants, mingling at
the tourney dinner with thrice-divorced women, quickly grows stale.
Eventually, he is on a second-floor window ledge, hoping to hit the
ground just right for maximum damage, when the call arrives that
will begin his comeback.
</P>
<P>
   It is the totality of Barnaby's foolishness that brought him to
the ledge, but one horrible episode was the catalyst. Five years
earlier, he had foreseen the drop in oil prices, sold short, and
made a bundle. It was just a good call. But flimsy, misleading
evidence surfaced, and then it was insider trading. He'd avoided
jail, but at the price of penury and public humiliation.
</P>
<P>
   Dillen unfolds these two tales in alternating chapters over the
first third of the book. In the volleying back and forth, both in
the tennis match and between the two story lines, Dillen creates a
delicious suspense that many mystery writers would envy, and
re-creates it throughout. It is just one of the delights ``Fool''
has to offer.
</P>
<P>
   Another is the deftness Dillen displays in detailing Barnaby's
makeup, and others' as well. Dillen sounds a scale of notes that
may be universal, or might just be personal to me, but they are
real. There is, for example, the conversation in his head after he
concludes a fairly successful date: She'd kissed him, called him
``Tiger,'' and volunteered her phone number, even though she'd be
leaving town and was uncertain about her return. Before he can even
leave the lot where they part, he has convinced himself that she
never wants to see him again: ``This was what they told you when
they didn't want you. This was what they'd told Barnaby always.
Except for (his wife) Win who'd made an honest mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   He'd first spoken to the woman, a waitress, as she cleaned him
up from a beating he'd taken at the hands of men who'd lost
everything, while he made a killing. He knew immediately: ``He
wanted to court this lovely girl for real, but he was a fat boy.''
He hadn't been a boy for decades, and he was in the best shape of
his life, but in the presence of a pretty girl, he is still fat in
his head.
</P>
<P>
   And Dillen is no more on target than when he tells one of
Barnaby's deepest truths: ``He felt as if all his victories were
ridiculous and his failures were true. It was a way he'd often
felt. That was who he was.'' We have met the enemy, and he lives
inside; how could we love him not?
</P>
<P>
   It would be overstating it to say that this is the perfect
``Fool.'' Dillen can ruminate too long, to the point of provoking
impatience. And sometimes his devices can confuse: Near the end,
for example, when he serves another volley of concurrent story
lines in alternating chapters, it is only annoying.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, though, the whole of ``Fool'' is just like the fool
within: flawed, but entirely lovable.

AH, ENGLAND: LAND OF MYSTERY AND MURDER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROBIN W. WINKS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Somehow being in England makes mystery and detective fiction
seem so much more important. The Agatha Christie industry alone
would float the economy of many a small nation. ``The Mousetrap,''
her legendary play, is not only a classic but now ``a landmark'' in
its 48th year, still showing eight times a week in London.
</P>
<P>
   English Heritage includes tours of places in southwest England
associated with her books. And one finds, even on a wet and
miserable day, one or two people moving about in the churchyard at
Cholsey in search of her grave.
</P>
<P>
   A book I overlooked when it was published in the United States
in the fall takes on resonance when read in England in the winter.
I write of ``Skull Mantra,'' by Elliot Pattison (St. Martin's
Minotaur, $24.95), which I devoured this month with great pleasure
after having laid it aside only a few weeks ago in a different
edition.
</P>
<P>
   This is Pattison's first novel, though he has written on
international matters a good bit. Shan Tao Yun, once a Chinese
police inspector and now just one more cipher in a prison camp work
gang transported to Tibet, is ordered to investigate, and quickly
resolve, the murder of an apparent American near the camp. The
corpse is headless, and the man's death has defiled the area, so
the Buddhist monks at the prison camp refuse to work until te site
is sanctified, which the Communist leaders refuse to do. A
solution, any solution, is demanded of Shan. Yet, to his surprise,
he finds one or two honest bureaucrats who want the crime solved,
not swept into one of the skull-filled caves in the region.
</P>
<P>
   Pattison weaves a fine mystery, with one or two good surprises
at the end, and he provides a surreal yet convincing backdrop to
the investigation by describing Tibetan religious practices with
great skill. Those in favor of more trade with China will think
again after reading of the realistically described human rights
abuses against the Tibetans here. Reviewers frequently compare a
new writer to Tony Hillerman: Here is a truly possible successor.
</P>
<P>
   Sherlock Holmes is also basic to the British canon, and Martin
Booth's biography, a little of Holmes but actually of Sir Arthur
Conan Doyle, is a sensible and very readable reexamination of all
that we know about the good doctor. ``The Doctor and the
Detective'' (St. Martin's Minotaur, $27.95) is the perfectly
apposite title. There is much here that would not have appeared in
such a study a generation or so ago, about cocaine and sexuality
and reading habits, and though I find Daniel Stashower's recent
biography of Holmes, praised here recently (and not mentioned in
Booth's bibliography) the better book, this one is a fine
introduction.
</P>
<P>
   Laurie R. King is not British, but the Oxford Times has just
referred to her as a local author on the strength of her marriage
to ``an Anglo-Indian'' who is here at Oxford, and her first Mary
Russell novel, ``The Bee-Keeper's Apprentice'' _ about the young
woman who eventually marries Sherlock Holmes _ is appearing
locally. Simultaneously in the United States, King's fifth Kate
Martinelli mystery is being published: ``Night Work'' (Bantam,
$23.95).
</P>
<P>
   Martinelli is with the San Francisco Police. King explores
feminist issues extremely well with or without Martinelli, who's a
lesbian, but I prefer with. A young Indian girl is burned to death,
and Kate is drawn in when an activist woman with experience in
India argues that the girl had been murdered because she was not
producing a male (or indeed any) child.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, men who have been rapists and wife beaters are
being found killed, a bit of candy in their pockets, and some
observers are inclined to blame the Sisters of Perpetual
Indulgence, a ``gay/lesbian/bi and/a-few-straights protest group''
which has hitherto used ridicule and embarrassment as its form of
attack. King is very, very good at looking society in the face and
reflecting on the way it is now.
</P>
<P>
   Two other books fall short of these three but nonetheless
provide food for thought and enough action to keep one reading late
into the night. Ryne Douglas Pearson's ``Top Ten'' (Putnam, $22.95)
is about a serial killer who is, of course, mad and, of course,
brilliant, and who is offended that he is not named numero uno on
the FBI's most-wanted list. He works at being the honoree by
killing all the others, and though the FBI and the various local
police forces spot what he is up to, they seem unable to head him
off.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the descriptions are rather grisly, so Lise McClendon's
``Nordic Nights'' (Walker, $23.95) is a good antidote. Set in
Jackson, Wyo., in midwinter, this book tells of the theft of some
valuable rune stones, explores a bit of archeology, and has a
terrific sense of place. Too bad McClendon says the famed Vinland
Map is in the British Museum when it is in Yale's Beinecke Library.
I guess the British will still win every time when crime is afoot.

TILSON THOMAS'S EXTREME SYMPHONY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD DYER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Michael Tilson Thomas is in his fifth season as music director
of the San Francisco Symphony. The partnership has captured the
imagination of a town whose heart has always belonged to opera; it
has also resulted in a series of best-selling, award-winning
records for RCA/BMG _ a situation in which Thomas and his band
stand virtually unique among American orchestras.
</P>
<P>
   Now Thomas is bringing the San Francisco Symphony to Symphony
Hall, the building where he made the spectacular start of his
career in 1969 as a 23-year-old assistant conductor of the Boston
Symphony Orchestra.
</P>
<P>
   There is a chemical relationship between Thomas and the San
Francisco Symphony. ``They play with enormous rhythmic propulsion
and security, a fearlessness about turning corners, which is
reflection both of my nerve endings and of theirs; it is a good
relationship. The players feel absolutely comfortable playing in
areas of musical extremes and everything in between, in terms of
dynamics and articulation, moving across the full range of what an
orchestra can exhibit. Because an orchestra is what it is, 100
people playing together, a middle-of-the-road kind of expression
can very easily result, the least common denominator. My process as
a conductor is about encouraging musicians to be comfortable about
exploring extremes.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas is pleased to report that the process seems to be
working. ``Our concerts are absolutely sold out and there is a
tremendous ardent furor around them that is a lovely thing to
experience. Our audience is very diverse and becoming younger. And
after the renovation, our hall is terrific, with a warm, grand
sound which deals a little more with spaciousness of sound rather
than specificity of sound. Few halls have both warmth and focus.
Symphony Hall is one of the greatest in the world but there is a
limited amount of sound it was architected to accept. But it does
mean that in something like Beethoven's Second Symphony you can
hear the scurrying 16th notes that follow the theme as something
more than a decorous murmur.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
------ &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   BankBoston Celebrity Series chose the most adventurous of
Thomas's touring programs. Arcadi Volodos will be on hand for the
Tchaikovsky Concerto (``I haven't met him yet, but he's a fiery
youngster, and I'm sure we can work something out''), but the rest
of the program is less familiar. Copland's ``Inscape'' was his last
major piece. The Boston Symphony has played it only once, under the
composer's direction, at Tanglewood. It opens with one of the most
astonishing chords in the repertory. ``It's one of those
Aaron-lays-down-the-law chords,'' Thomas says. `` `Inscape' may be
a 12-tone piece, but it's totally Aaron in every gesture and every
note. In it there's an issue of pacing and voice, more than in any
other piece he wrote; the performers have to realize a pattern of
nuances which coincide with the cadences of a spoken voice, in this
case Aaron's.''
</P>
<P>
   The program closes with one of the major works of Thomas's San
Fancisco contemporary John Adams, ``Harmonielehre.'' ``This was
written for the orchestra and I've been doing it for a number of
years; it holds up. There's a lot of phrasing to be done in it.
When I was first struggling with these enormous lines, I called up
John and said, `What do you wnat me to do? Should I phrase this or
hang glide?' He said, `If you want to phrase it, you can,' so I do.
We've worked with the sequences, with the breaths in the piece, and
made the music more specifically personal. Everything that can be
done to make the orchstra more luxuriously upholstered has already
been done. I am interested in inflections, in the spontaneous mood
and character you normally get only with a soloist, above all a
singer.''
</P>
<P>
   The orchestra has followed a big Stravinsky recording project _
which won Grammys for classical album and orchestra performance
last week _ with discs that will be devoted to Ives and to Copland.
``We are coming to the end of our contract with BMB but we are
still talking about things well into the future. We know we will be
making music in the future and making musical products, but how
these are going to financed and distributed will change. There are
experiments to be done and formats to be explored.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas devotes 18 weeks a year to the San Francisco Symphony and
otherwise spends his time with the New World Symphony in Miami (12
weeks a year) and the London Symphony Orchestra. He owns homes both
in San Francisco and in Miami Beach.
</P>
<P>
   The New World Symphony was created to help conservatory
graduates cross the bridge into professional orchestras. Players
from all the great orchestras travel to Miami to work with the
young musicians _ among the Bostonians have been Ralph Gomberg,
Roger Voisin, Mary Lou Speaker Churchill, Douglas Yeo, Ronald
Feldman, Harry Shapiro, and New World Symphony alumnus Keisuke
Wakao. ``Being in the orchestra is a tremendous experience for
these young musicians _ the average stay is 1.79 years. No matter
what you've learned in school, the profession is something
different; there are all sorts of things you really do have to
learn _ things they don't teach you in school. They have usually
worked with the same teacher for years. Now they encounter people
from diverse perspectives and with different approaches. There are
many ways to accomplish what you want to do, many ways to think
about music. This experience helps them musically, technically, and
temperamentally to work better. It is as inclusive as possible and
a great resource for our country.''

   Thomas has done relatively little opera since founding the New
World Symphony, a choice he has made. And he does very little guest
conducting. ``I receive lots of invitations I wish I could say yes
to, but my other commitments preclude it. I would love to conduct
the BSO sometime again. Most of the players from the BSO of my
youth are retired. It was a wonderful relationship I had wtih that
orchestra, and it made a huge contribution to my life. At some
point I want to pay homage to that gratefully and generously. Now I
have to think about the amount of time I have left to do what I
want to do. I am very committed to my Yiddish theater projects, and
I am very interested in film and video projects, things that only I
can do. Could I conduct a terrific `Tristan' or `Invisible City of
Kitezh'? Of course I can, but it is very important to make sure
that you do the things that you uniquely can do.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked what BSO managing director Mark Volpe and the search
committee for Seiji Ozawa's successor should be looking for, Thomas
says, ``It should be a total matter of chemistry. It is essential
for the orchestra to search for someone who has the temperament,
the personality, the possibilities for communication, to bring the
orchestra into a different place. It must be someone that the
orchestra finds comfortable and at some level different enough to
take them into some new, exciting and engaging place, and that can
only come out of their own temperament and experience.''
</P>
<P>
   Now 55, Thomas feels his own Boston successes of 30 years ago
came about because what he was after was so different from what the
orchestra was doing under Erich Leinsdorf and William Steinberg. He
came from a family prominent in the Yiddish theater, and his
Thomashefsky roots are very important to him.
</P>
<P>
   ``The orchestra had been developed and inspired by Leinsdorf,''
Thomas says, choosing his words carefully. ``But it was constrained
spiritually. The rule was to keep within the box, and then I came
along with all my young enthusiasm and Russian-Jewish connections,
and some way or another the players associated me with the days of
Koussevitzky and Munch, when the attitude was, ``We believe in
this, so let's go for it.' Lots of the sounds I heard from the BSO
back then are still in my ears to this day. What I had to go
through as an artist was to learn to take this enthusiasm and
imagination and absolutely relentless and compromising ear for
emotional involvement and translate it into much more efficient,
specific kinds of instruction. I've held on to the ardency of the
early days, but I've become a good director who can in a very few
words focus on what the issue is.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas is feeling particularly content these days because he has
rediscovered a calling as a composer. This is a new thing that has
brought him back to an old one _ as a young man, he had studied
with Stravinsky's protege, Ingolf Dahl. ``I have written chamber
pieces and two orchestra pieces. Last year I composed three song
cycles that took things to a more intense level. Now I'm writing a
new song cycle for Renee Fleming and a new orchestral piece.
Composition is coming more into focus, and I am getting much better
at disposing of notes that don't need to be there. What I am trying
to write is tonal music, but adventurous tonal music. The ultimate
test is whether I can sing it through in the bathtub from beginning
to end. Of course I'm not your usual bathtub singer. Years ago,
Oliver Knussen and I used to sit around and sing Stravinsky's
Aldous Huxley Variations from beginning to end.''

A HEARTBREAKING WORK OF STAGGERING GENIUS 
By Dave Eggers. Simon &AMP; Schuster. 375 pp. $23. 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   To call this book brazen is like calling a blizzard white _it's
true, but it leaves out most of the story. Dave Eggers's
memoir-maybe is a defiantly Not Tragic soliloquy; it's also hip,
funny, wildly intelligent, and as flushed with narrative energy as
anything I've read in some time. Eggers doesn't just send up the
conventions of memoir and commercial publishing; he stomps on them,
then tries them on as weird hats. By the time you've emerged from
the book's 40-page, small-font preface _ which contains tips on
metaphors, a note of thanks to the Armed Forces, and instructions
on how to get part of your money back _ you either want to kill him
or have him move in next door. No, never mind; that wouldn't work;
he'd be ringing your doorbell at all hours, wanting to use your fax
machine, blathering on about cultural imperialism or his old
girlfriends, or wanting to borrow your dog for Frisbee or a photo
shoot.
</P>
<P>
   You see? That's how he does it. You open your door a crack, and
Bam: His sensibility has found its way into your head.
</P>
<P>
   Its say-you-will title notwithstanding, ``A Heartbreaking Work
of Staggering Genius'' is, along with everything else, emotionally
wrenching, in part because of the willfully dry-eyed narrative that
delivers its central story. The third of four children, Eggers was
21 when his parents died from cancer, in the early 1990s, within a
month of each other. Eggers left college to go back to Lake Forest,
the Chicago suburb where he was raised; the day his mother went to
the hospital for the last time, he carried her to the car. When the
funerals were over, the kids split up the post-mortem bedlam: Bill,
the oldest son, took care of the financial decisions; Beth, the
next in line, handled the paperwork; and Dave _ who clearly
wouldn't have allowed it any other way _ got his 8-year-old
brother, Toph.
</P>
<P>
   So beyond its narrative hijinks and 3-D irony, this is the story
of a young man and his little brother: a child whom Dave Eggers
loves so fiercely and unequivocally that he panics when he has to
leave the boy with a baby sitter. All the Eggers children will
relocate in California, with Bill in LA and Beth in law school at
Berkeley and Dave and Toph hovering nearby, creating a domestic
situation only mildly more poignant than it is insane. Here is
Toph's schedule: school (religiously, but always late); Little
League practice (with Dave screaming from the bleachers with the
other moms); dinner at home (tacos and oranges, no frills, few
deviations).
</P>
<P>
   If their housekeeping wouldn't please Martha Stewart, it's hard
to imagine a child-welfare expert finding fault with the Eggers
brothers for their emotional milieu. They are Batman and Robin;
they are mother bear and cub. Trying his damnedest to spend one
night with a girlfriend _ Toph is sleeping at Beth's _ Eggers goes
home at dawn, just in case: Otherwise, Toph ``would know I had
stayed elsewhere, and would not understand this, and would grow up
to sell crack or sing in a harmonizing pop group from Florida.''
</P>
<P>
   I am not worried about Toph, though if he ever gets too far away
from his brother _ the two have since relocated to Brooklyn _
boredom may prove to be a problem. Setting up house in Berkeley
also meant working, of course, and Eggers, whose background seems
to be a blend of art, graphics, and cyber-smarts, did temp work in
graphics design when he wasn't attending baseball practice and
parent-teacher conferences. With the dozen or so Chicago friends
who had also relocated to the Bay Area, he founded and produced
``Might,'' a smash-the-state periodical that wanted to change the
world but forgot to pay its rent.
</P>
<P>
   ``A Heartbreaking Work . . .'' provides a chronicle of these
first few transitional years, establishing a narrative scaffolding
from which Eggers can take flight: back to the bedside of his
mother before she died, back to the ``loud, semi-violent alcoholic
household'' of his childhood, back to the funerals where too few
mourners came and no words or eulogies would ever be enough.
</P>
<P>
   Hiding within a hall-of-mirrors self-awareness and a kind of
post-Beckettian humor, Eggers's memories show up in various guises,
from mildly fictionalized interviews (an audition for the MTV hit
``Real World'') to occasional visits from a literary superego (part
muse, part snooty conscience).
</P>
<P>
   But these creative devices don't deserve much emphasis beyond
their narrative achievement: If they didn't work so well in giving
us Eggers's voice and story, they wouldn't matter at all. For the
most part, they work demonically well; this is one of the few
examples I've seen where a mind exposed to multimedia saturation _
to good-bad pop culture, rock 'n' roll, cyberspace creativity _
actually results in a superior literary narrative. It's a carnival
ride of insights from a writer who can be breathtakingly
articulate, and who (it must be said) comes off sounding like a
really cool guy.
</P>
<P>
   There's great potential for the opposite: It would be easy to
rely merely upon the brainpower and technique of ``A Heartbreaking
Work . . .'' and come off sounding like a jerk, filled as it is
with diversionary tactics. But Eggers knows when to get out of the
way of his story, whether it's the night he dementedly confronts
six people messing with him on a beach or the account of his return
to Lake Forest.
</P>
<P>
   What's consistent throughout is the full-throttle voice: the
sensibility of the man who grieves (and maybe loved and maybe
hated) his parents, who safeguards his brother, who knows that his
own presence here can walk the line between ``self-conscious'' and
``self-devouring.'' Occasionally you're aware that Eggers is
fleeing heartache by waxing manic, which can wear pretty thin; this
is particularly true when he's immersed in the story of ``Might,''
say, instead of where you know he belongs. But the last 70 pages of
his book have the momentum of an engine opened up on an empty road
out West. It's Stephen Daedalus bumping into Hunter S. Thompson _
Eggers the anti-martyr on a sunny afternoon, a moment of grief
caught in the hand, then transformed into something pastoral before
it's gone.

&HT;     THE VOICE OF REASON MAY NOT BE HUMAN 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By KEAY DAVIDSON  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Humans have always hurled invective at
technology, cursing balky tools, snapping at telephone answering
machines, and sputtering furiously at the flashing ``12:00'' on
video recorders. Now technology is talking back, and it is being
much nicer to us than we have been to it.
</P>
<P>
   Because of amazing improvements in speech recognition
technology, you can buy a plane ticket or check a stock price
without talking to a living soul. Simply dial the right number and
converse with a human-sounding computer, a computer that never
loses patience, acts bored, or sounds like it is chewing gum.
</P>
<P>
   United Airlines, for example, uses the voice of an engaging
young man _ actually a computer _ to provide arrival and departure
times.
</P>
<P>
   ``The goal (is) to put the caller at ease,'' said Mike Phillips,
chief technical officer for Boston-based SpeechWorks, the company
that developed the phone-answering system for United. ``There's
been huge amounts of progress. Each year we're making these systems
and the technology better and better.''
</P>
<P>
   Speech-recognition technology, which for decades seemed like the
backward stepchild of computing research, is starting to fulfill
its potential.
</P>
<P>
   The goal of a 100 percent natural-sounding conversation between
humans and computers remains elusive. But technological
developments may soon make buying a plane ticket from a computer
routine.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a dramatically different way of communicating,'' said
Steve Ehrlich of Nuance Communications in Menlo Park, Calif., which
has sold its own speech-recognition innovations to more than 70
companies in eight countries.
</P>
<P>
   Nuance developed the voice-recognition system used by Charles
Schwab &AMP; Co., the San Francisco-based brokerage, to provide callers
instant information about stocks.
</P>
<P>
   ``The excitement about the technology is incredible,'' Ehrlich
said. ``Often I get a voice mail message saying, `Was that a
machine? That was incredible!''
</P>
<P>
   Still, it's no easy trick to create a computer system that not
only understands a wide range of human speech dialects but that
sounds helpful and amiable enough to encourage the caller to stay
on the line, rather than hang up in frustration.
</P>
<P>
   The maturation of the technology stems from decades of tedious
research, nourished partly by innovations in fields such as
artificial intelligence and fuzzy logic.
</P>
<P>
   Even more crucial has been extensive, trial-and-error lab work
by human factors engineers who work with professional speakers to
develop computerized voices.
</P>
<P>
   Nuance has developed flight-reservation systems so sophisticated
that they can distinguish between similar-sounding words such as
``Oakland'' and ``Auckland.'' To avoid mistakes, the computer
always repeats what the caller has said, to get confirmation.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not just a U.S. phenomenon,'' Ehrlich said. ``The
technology has evolved to the point where we can not only recognize
different dialects and accents, but also the dialects and accents
within every language. In the UK, we can recognize the Cockney
accent or the Irish-UK accent.''
</P>
<P>
   Blade Kotelly, a human factors engineer at SpeechWorks, designs
speech-recognition systems based on several premises, among them:
The late oceanographer Jacques Cousteau's remark that ``The best
way to understand a fish is to become one.''
</P>
<P>
   Kotelly said ``we try to get into the heads of our users and our
customers'' by understanding exactly how they might feel, second by
second, as they navigate the anxiety-inducing world of telephone
answering systems.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I would want to be treated intelligently on the phone,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Kotelly developed the United voice by working with people who do
voiceovers for commercials. ``The big thing for us is conveying
sincerity and meaning so that you'll think, `They're really trying
to help me out,''' he said.
</P>
<P>
   This entails filling the computerized statements with ``little
pauses'' and other subtle inflections to make it sound as natural
as possible. It is important, Kotelly said, that the voice not
sound imperious or ``like a radio DJ either, (because) very quickly
it sounds ridiculous.''
</P>
<P>
   Kotelly definitely doesn't want the system to sound like HAL the
computer in the film ``2001: A Space Odyssey.'' HAL's voice,
Kotelly said, is ``a little bit subdued and manipulative in a
subtle way ... sinister. We want to avoid that sinister quality.''
</P>
<P>
   Before a phone system is sent to a corporate buyer, Kotelly
tests it on focus groups.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we see their faces grimace we know we have to change
it,'' he said. ``And when we see them smile we know that we're on
the right track.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if the technology would deprive humans of jobs, Ehrlich
said the machines free people from the drab, monotonous job of
answering phone calls and allow them to tackle tasks that are
intellectually more challenging.
</P>
<P>
   ``All in all,'' he said, ``the technology is a `win' for
everybody _ for businesses because they save money, and for
consumers because they can get their business done far more
efficiently than ever before.''

</P>
<P>
   SCI-WARMING-DEBATE (Undated) _ A recent study by the research

``in no way invalidates the conclusion that surface temperature has
been rising.'' The surface warming ``is undoubtedly real,'' the
study panel said. But the dissenters are a long way from conceding

underlying warming trend for much of the free atmosphere, up to
about five miles, mainly in the tropics. In fact, the raw numbers
showed a cooling there. By William K. Stevens. (850 words).

philanthropic instincts. By Celia W. Dugger.
</P>
<P>
   PAKISTAN-SHARIF (New Delhi, India) _ The hijacking trial of the
deposed prime minister of Pakistan _ already a cavalcade of the
unexpected and the bizarre _took another odd twist over the weekend
as his entire defense team quit in protest of alleged government
unfairness. By Barry Bearak.
</P>
<P>
   CHINA-RIGHTS (United Nations) _ China, faced with the Clinton
administration's determination to have Beijing's human rights
record condemned at this year's U.N. Human Rights Commission
session, is mobilizing its defense by using the kind of U.N.
mechanisms that can make it relatively easy to avoid censure when a

</P>
<P>
   DEUTSCHE-BANK (Frankfurt, Germany) _ Deutsche Bank has 1,500
local offices and seven million retail banking customers. They are
the biggest bank-branch network in Germany, but the network barely
ekes out a profit and consistently drags down the bank's overall
performance. Now Rolf-Ernst Breuer, the chairman of Deutsche Bank,
is hinting at something more radical: the possibility of giving up
a controlling stake in his own branches. Few analysts believe
Deutsche Bank will simply sell off its brick-and-mortar branch
network. But Breuer is clearly impatient and also seems convinced
that traditional banking is withering and radical changes are
necessary to survive. By Edmund L. Andrews.

<P>

retire as co-chief executive of Citigroup in April. Sandy Weill to

   SAN ANTONIO _ Mary Medina will celebrate a milestone on Tuesday,
the day she turns 15.
</P>
<P>
   And in preparation, her closest friends organized her ``quince
anera'' on Saturday, maintaining the Hispanic tradition of
celebrating when a girl turns 15.
</P>
<P>
   But in Medina's case, the 15-year-old is really marking 60 years
of life that included marriage and motherhood.
</P>
<P>
   Medina is a leap-year baby and technically celebrates her
birthday only once every four years, when February gains a 29th
day. So the quince anera had special meaning this year, both as a
celebration of an age milestone and her deep friendships.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know I was so well-loved,'' Medina said before
Saturday's party. ``This has got to be a blessing from God.''
</P>
<P>
   Medina's party was something of the opening page in her life's
latest chapter. Her husband, Eddie, died in May, and she only
recently made the transition from lifelong housewife to working
woman. The party's theme was ``Friends and Butterflies Forever'' _
dedicated, she said, to the foundation that keeps her steady and to
the creatures that signify new life and adventure.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm moving on and having a new life,'' said Medina, a
maintenance worker at the San Antonio Jewish Community Campus.
``Butterflies come out in the spring from their cocoons, and they
dress up the countryside.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sad my husband is not here but I'm having to start over
again, this time without him. I'm totally in charge of life.''
</P>
<P>
   In Hispanic culture, it's customary to have a quince anera with
sponsors who pay for the celebration. Medina has the customary 14
madrinas who pitched in money for the food and the rented hall at
Holy Rosary Catholic Church.
</P>
<P>
   Spearheading the party were Dora Lopez and Flo Maley. The
stay-at-home moms nicknamed themselves ``domestic engineers''
because they would shop together, baby-sit one another's children
and make prizes for PTA functions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are the real comadres,'' Medina said.
</P>
<P>
   Lopez recalls meeting Medina at a PTA meeting. Medina, who has
two sons, is the godmother of Lopez's two daughters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once in a lifetime you meet someone who's worth any amount of
trouble and Mary is that someone,'' said Lopez, a close friend of
28 years. ``The blessings she has brought us cannot be counted.''

   SCI-DARK-MATTER (Undated) _ New conclusions about the nature of
dark matter, which makes up most of the universe, based on a
conference in Florida. 1,000 words. By James Glanz.
</P>
<P>
   With photo, NYT6.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-DOCTOR-ERROR (Undated) _ Doctors have amputated the wrong
leg, killed patients with overdoses of medications and committed
other serious errors for centuries. So why only now is a United
States president calling for the first national plan to reduce such
errors? The reasons behind the new concern are as complex as
medicine itself and as varied as recent changes in society,
including medical advances, greater complexity of care, increasing
challenge to medical authority and new techniques to pinpoint
sources of errors in the maze of systems that doctors and hospital
staffs use every day. By Lawrence K. Altman. (1940 words)
</P>
<P>
   With photo, NYT7.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-PLANT-GENES (Undated) _ An Australian scientist is trying to
reshape the tangled global debate over the role of genetic
engineering in agricultural biotechnology. He argues that the high
degree of genetic overlap among all living things suggests that
much of the gene swapping among species may be unnecessary.
Perhaps, instead of moving a valuable trait like resistance to cold
from a fish to a plant, genetic engineers could achieve the same
result by goading the plant into a mutation that activates genes
for cold tolerance already present in its DNA. By Barnaby J. Feder
(1550 words)
</P>
<P>
   With photo.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-VOLCANOS (Undated) _ The Earth's habit of forever remaking
itself in paroxysms of fire and violence is sometimes hard on its
inhabitants, a lesson borne out again last week when villagers near
Legazpi, in the Philippines, fled eruptions of the deadly volcano
Mayon. In a new book, ``Vulcan's Fury: Man Against the Volcano,''
(Yale University Press) the writer Alwyn Scarth uses eyewitness
accounts to tell the tale of 15 great eruptions and of the people
who lived through them. Some samples of the work (1880 words)
</P>
<P>
   With photos, NYT8,9,10.

   SCI-WATCH (Undated) _ News and notes on science: Items on life
after pollution, desert locusts and the perils of garbage
collection. By Henry Fountain. (675 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-GENE-DISCRIM (Undated) _ An introduction to pro-con
commentaries on an executive order dealing with genetic
discrimination. (128 words)
</P>
<P>
   With
</P>
<P>
   SCI-GENE-DISCRIM-PRO () _ President Clinton's executive order on
genetic discrimination is a significant step toward ensuring that
advances in genetics will be to the benefit, not to the detriment
of individuals in society. To quote President Clinton: ``My goal is
to set an example and pose a challenge for every employer in
America, because I believe no employer should ever review your
genetic records along with your resume.'' By Wendy R. Uhlman. (1100
words)
</P>
<P>
   And
</P>
<P>
   SCI-GENE-DISCRIM-CON () _ President Clinton's recent ban of
genetic discrimination by federal employers is not in response to
any widespread practice, or even any collection of documented
cases, of federal agencies misusing genetic information. Instead,
the executive order responds to growing, and somewhat unfounded,
fears about the potential misuse of genetics. The main purpose of
this law is to calm public fears to spur development of genetic
technologies and help genetic researchers recruit subjects for
their studies. By Mark A. Hall. (1190 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-ACNE (Undated) _ Medical science has now taken on the lowly
pimple _ and with unheralded but nevertheless fairly astounding
success. New treatments, some developed only in the last few years,
mean that pimples can be a thing of the past. By Clara Hemphill.
(1450 words)
</P>
<P>
   Photo, NYT11.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-BRODY-HEALTH (Undated) _ Personal Health column: Doctors had
long assumed that exclusive breast-feeding for at least the first
six months of life and delaying the introduction of allergenic
foods like peanuts, cow's milk and eggs was the best way to stave
off allergies. But several new studies indicate that there are
limits to the long-term effectiveness of this approach for babies
most at risk for developing allergies. By Jane E. Brody. (1300
words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-FITNESS-TRAIN (Undated) _ Sports-specific exercise used to
be limited to high-stakes, elite-level competitors. But now growing
numbers of recreational athletes, who participate in a wide-range
of sports, are hiring trainers to help them build specific muscles
and hone their technique to meet more modest goals. By Linda
Villarosa. (850 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-VITAL-SIGNS (Undated) _ News and note on health and fitness:
</P>
<P>
   _ Researchers at Yale say they have proven that the human
tongue, under the right conditions, perceives certain temperatures
as very specific tastes. Warm, for example, tastes sweet and
sometimes bitter, while cold can produce a sensation of saltiness
or sourness. (360 words)
</P>
<P>
   _ Feeling hopeless is not just unpleasant: it may also be bad
for your health. A new study suggests that people who suffer
persistent periods of hopelessness may be at greater risk for
hypertension, researchers at the University of Michigan School of
Public Health report. (175 words)
</P>
<P>
   _ A new study reports that doctors who treat terminally ill
people routinely overestimate how much time their patients have
left to live, and, as a result, may deprive them of the kind of
care they need. (300 words)
</P>
<P>
   _ When it comes to teen-age pregnancy and childbearing, American
teen-agers are best compared to those in the Russian Federation or
in troubled, former East Bloc countries like Bulgaria, a new study
finds. Teen-age pregnancy and childbearing rates here are at least
four times those in France, Germany and Japan, said researchers
from Alan Guttmacher Institute, an American group that researchers
reproductive health. (290 words)
</P>
<P>
   _ A new team of researchers has weighed into the debate over
whether infants should be routinely screened for hearing loss at
birth. Although some experts believe that such testing is
unwarranted, researchers from the University of Colorado at Boulder
are offering evidence to the contrary. (250 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-Q&AMP;A (Undated) _ A science question answered: Do parrots and
other birds that talk have any special physical equipment in the
larynx or tongue that helps them speak? By C. Claiborne Ray. (290
words)

&HT;     PRISON WATCHOG CALLS FOR FEDERAL PROBE OF RIOT 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By SETH ROSENFELD  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ A prison watchdog group has called for an
independent investigation of the bloody riot at Pelican Bay State
Prison and whether any officers failed to prevent the violence.
</P>
<P>
   The Prison Law Office, a nonprofit organization that has
successfully sued the California Department of Corrections to
improve conditions at Pelican Bay and other prisons, on Saturday
said outside agencies should investigate the riot.
</P>
<P>
   ``The FBI, the state inspector general or the Legislature, or
all of them, ought to look at what happened,'' said Steven Fama, a
staff attorney at the San Rafael branch of the Prison Law Office.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not confident, given the department's track record, that
the public should entrust the investigation of this serious
incident solely to an in-house team,'' Fama said.
</P>
<P>
   About 250 inmates fought in one of the prison exercise yards on
Feb. 23 in what officials have described as a clash between mainly
Hispanic and black prisoners. Thirty-two inmates were stabbed or
slashed with homemade weapons.
</P>
<P>
   When inmates did not stop fighting after official warnings and
nonlethal measures, officers opened fire, shooting 16 inmates, one
fatally, in the state's worst prison riot in more than a decade.
</P>
<P>
   The officers' use of force is already under investigation by a
special Department of Corrections team that is working with the Del
Norte County Sheriff's Department. Pelican Bay houses about 3,200
of the state's maximum security inmates.
</P>
<P>
   There have been past incidents of violence against inmates at
Pelican Bay, as well as recent tensions between some prison staff
and black inmates, Fama said.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyer, who was at the prison following the riot, said he
saw a videotape of the clash that confirmed officials' earlier
statements that the melee was racial.
</P>
<P>
   The video was shown to Fama and others appointed by a federal
judge to monitor court-ordered improvements in prison conditions, a
result of a 1991 civil rights suit.
</P>
<P>
   The video, he said, showed a larger number of Hispanic inmates,
some of whom seemed to be armed with homemade weapons, launch an
organized attack on a smaller group of mostly unarmed black
inmates.
</P>
<P>
   The video did not capture the full sweep of the yard, but
spanned the duration of the fighting, which lasted about 10
minutes, Fama said. Some other accounts had reported that the
fighting lasted 30 minutes, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Prison officials have said they seized 89 homemade weapons from
prisoners after the incident.
</P>
<P>
   Fama questioned how so many inmates could slip weapons past
officers, who, he said, on other occasions have screened prisoners
before letting them on the yard.
</P>
<P>
   According to the lawyer, since December 1998 tensions have grown
between black inmates and some officers. And in the last month,
there have been two alleged instances in which black prisoners were
assaulted by other inmates who were supposed to be locked in their
cells, but mysteriously were allowed out, Fama said. One of the
inmates was assaulted while leaving a shower, and the other was
attacked as he was being returned to his cell, the lawyer said.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, a Pelican Bay officer was convicted of conspiracy to
assault an inmate, and this month a second officer was convicted in
San Francisco federal court of civil rights violations in
connection with the shooting of another inmate.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, two former Pelican Bay guards were charged with
violating the rights of inmates by arranging assaults against them
in the early 1990s.

<P>
   SCI-WARMING-DEBATE (Undated) _ A recent study by the research
arm of the National Academy of Sciences has declared that the
``apparent disparity'' between surface and atmospheric temperatures
``in no way invalidates the conclusion that surface temperature has
been rising.'' The surface warming ``is undoubtedly real,'' the
study panel said. But the dissenters are a long way from conceding
the climate debate, and they have seized on some other aspects of
the panel's report in an effort to bolster their case. By William
K. Stevens. (2075 words)

   SCI-WARMING-DISPARITY (Undated) _ Two skeptics in the climate
debate discovered that in some ways the satellite and surface
trends roughly matched. Both sets of measurements found substantial
warming over Northern Hemisphere continents, for instance, and the
timing of year-to-year temperature fluctuations was about the same
in both. But unlike the surface record, the satellites revealed no
underlying warming trend for much of the free atmosphere, up to
about five miles, mainly in the tropics. In fact, the raw numbers
showed a cooling there. By William K. Stevens. (850 words).

   SCI-DOCTOR-ERROR (Undated) _ Doctors have amputated the wrong
leg, killed patients with overdoses of medications and committed
other serious errors for centuries. So why only now is a United
States president calling for the first national plan to reduce such
errors? The reasons behind the new concern are as complex as
medicine itself and as varied as recent changes in society,
including medical advances, greater complexity of care, increasing
challenge to medical authority and new techniques to pinpoint
sources of errors in the maze of systems that doctors and hospital
staffs use every day. By Lawrence K. Altman. (1940 words)

   SCI-PLANT-GENES (Undated) _ An Australian scientist is trying to
reshape the tangled global debate over the role of genetic
engineering in agricultural biotechnology. He argues that the high
degree of genetic overlap among all living things suggests that
much of the gene swapping among species may be unnecessary.
Perhaps, instead of moving a valuable trait like resistance to cold
from a fish to a plant, genetic engineers could achieve the same
result by goading the plant into a mutation that activates genes
for cold tolerance already present in its DNA. By Barnaby J. Feder

   SCI-VOLCANOS (Undated) _ The Earth's habit of forever remaking
itself in paroxysms of fire and violence is sometimes hard on its

Legazpi, in the Philippines, fled eruptions of the deadly volcano
Mayon. In a new book, ``Vulcan's Fury: Man Against the Volcano,''

   SCI-GENE-DISCRIM-PRO () _ President Clinton's executive order on
genetic discrimination is a significant step toward ensuring that
advances in genetics will be to the benefit, not to the detriment
of individuals in society. To quote President Clinton: ``My goal is
to set an example and pose a challenge for every employer in

genetic records along with your resume.'' By Wendy R. Uhlman. (1100

<P>
   And
</P>
<P>
   SCI-GENE-DISCRIM-CON () _ President Clinton's recent ban of
genetic discrimination by federal employers is not in response to
any widespread practice, or even any collection of documented
cases, of federal agencies misusing genetic information. Instead,
the executive order responds to growing, and somewhat unfounded,
fears about the potential misuse of genetics. The main purpose of
this law is to calm public fears to spur development of genetic
technologies and help genetic researchers recruit subjects for
their studies. By Mark A. Hall. (1190 words)

   SCI-BRODY-HEALTH (Undated) _ Personal Health column: Doctors had
long assumed that exclusive breast-feeding for at least the first
six months of life and delaying the introduction of allergenic
foods like peanuts, cow's milk and eggs was the best way to stave
off allergies. But several new studies indicate that there are

   _ Researchers at Yale say they have proven that the human
tongue, under the right conditions, perceives certain temperatures
as very specific tastes. Warm, for example, tastes sweet and
sometimes bitter, while cold can produce a sensation of saltiness
or sourness. (360 words)
</P>
<P>
   _ Feeling hopeless is not just unpleasant: it may also be bad
for your health. A new study suggests that people who suffer
persistent periods of hopelessness may be at greater risk for
hypertension, researchers at the University of Michigan School of
Public Health report. (175 words)
</P>
<P>
   _ A new study reports that doctors who treat terminally ill
people routinely overestimate how much time their patients have
left to live, and, as a result, may deprive them of the kind of
care they need. (300 words)
</P>
<P>
   _ When it comes to teen-age pregnancy and childbearing, American
teen-agers are best compared to those in the Russian Federation or
in troubled, former East Bloc countries like Bulgaria, a new study
finds. Teen-age pregnancy and childbearing rates here are at least
four times those in France, Germany and Japan, said researchers
from Alan Guttmacher Institute, an American group that researchers
reproductive health. (290 words)
</P>
<P>
   _ A new team of researchers has weighed into the debate over

WHAT NUMBERS DO WE USE TO SAY WHAT DATE THIS IS? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, March 5)  
(Eds: Items in bold should be set in italics.) 
(lb) 
 By WILLIAM SAFIRE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Language is expressed in writing with a series of symbols. When
people cannot agree what the symbols stand for, all is confusion.
We find ourselves gesticulating wildly in a Tower of Babel.
</P>
<P>
   Ah, you say, but globalization and Internetting will fix all
that. Computers inside a little translating bug in our ear will
enable us all to understand one another instantly. Or English will
become everybody's second language until a universal language takes
over someday.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, yeah? (That's based on the Sanskrit for ``Izzat so?'') Then
how come all the nations of the world, marching into the new
millennium, can't agree on what date of the month this is? A
furious tug of war is going on between Europe and America that
dwarfs the banana wars in importance, threatens the Atlantic
Alliance and paralyzes the United Nations. But nobody is willing to
face up to the Date Debate.
</P>
<P>
   What's today? Unless we're Chinese or Hebrew or some other
civilization with its own calendar, we can all agree it's the fifth
day of the month of March in the year 2000. And we also agree that
it's easier to put that date in a combination of words and
numerals: March 5, 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Unless, of course, you're in the military. Then it's 5 March
2000, saving valuable commas needed for investment in missile
research and _ more to the point _ nicely separating the numbers
with a word.
</P>
<P>
   But we're all in a hurry; who wants to take all the time to
write out the whole word signifying the month? Since March is the
third month, we substitute the number 3 for the word's interminable
five letters. So March 5, 2000 is shown as 3/5/2000. (Unless you
like hyphens _ then it's 3-5-2000. Or unless you prefer voguish
periods, now called dots, as The New York Times Magazine
finger-snappingly does; then it's 3.5.2000, which has been further
shortened to 3.5.00.)
</P>
<P>
   This simple act of reducing a date to its shortest elements is
the cause of the semiotic War Between the Continents now
threatening to end globalization as we know it. ``In the United
States,'' writes Dr. Alan D. Legatt of White Plains, N.Y., ``a date
written as 1/2 would mean Jan. 2, while in Europe it would mean the
first of February.''
</P>
<P>
   So today's date _ the fifth day of the third month in the run-up
to our brand-new third millennium _ is written in America as
3/5/00. (I'm a slasher, not a hyphenator or a dotter.) But in
Britain and throughout Europe, those same numerals signify an
entirely different date: the third day of the fifth month, or May
3, 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Big difference. March goes out like a lamb; rough winds do shake
the darling buds of May. Even worse, when President Bill Clinton
sends a cheery note to Prime Minister Tony Blair and dates it 4/11,
the Yank is thinking of April 11 but the Brit thinks it is Nov. 4.
This is sure to contribute to Anglo-American misunderstanding; if
it leads to one leader standing the other up at a scheduled summit
meeting, it could put a strain on the special relationship.
</P>
<P>
   To resolve this problem before it discombobulates trans-Atlantic
e-mail and drives the editors of The International Herald Tribune
to distraction, a nongovernmental organization that calls itself
ISO has put forward a recommendation.
</P>
<P>
   The name is an acronym formed by the rejiggered initials of the
International Organization for Standardization, headquartered in
Geneva;  &UR; ISO &LR;  is rooted in the Greek word for ``equal,'' and this
outfit seeks to get everyone to agree on the same symbols for the
same things. To avert date warfare, ISO recommends that we all
start with the year, followed by the month and finally the day.
Today's date, in ISO format, is 2000-3-5.
</P>
<P>
   As they like to mutter in the Pentagon, I nonconcur. Who are
these cookie-pushing cookie cutters of an unelected international
bureaucracy to tell America's native speakers that we must conform
to the linguistic  &UR; diktats &LR;  of Continental Common Marketeers and
sovereignty-grabbing European Unionists? Do the Brits think that
English is a better language than Merkin?
</P>
<P>
   ISO may call me a lationist, but I reject this backdoor attempt
to force American check writers to date our support of the
International Monetary Fund in a way alien to our ways.
</P>
<P>
   If those one-worlders in Geneva are so het up about
standardization, why don't they adopt the American system? A
millennium and a half from now, the standardeers will be writing
the second of January in the year three thousand four hundred and
fifty-six as 3456/1/2, while we will write it as 1/2/3456, which
will be a real kick.
</P>
<P>
   The Brits, on the verge of giving up their pound for the euro,
are losing their regard for tradition, but when it comes to habits,
Americans _ even those who prattle at election time about the need
for great change _ hate change. It was hard enough for some of us
to memorize the month-day-year sequence in the first place (if I
have that order right); we don't need to reprogram our minds just
because some professional smoother-outers want everybody in the
world to march in lock step.
</P>
<P>
   Hawks, finding geopolitical significance in this coming symbolic
dust-up, will cry: If being a sole superpower does not give us
hegemony in the writing of dates, why go to the expense of being a
superpower at all? Doves, taking a less bellicose line, will coo:
Diversity is more precious than uniformity.
</P>
<P>
   I say: By jingo, let's stick to our slashes and hold fast to the
American Way of Dating. To the standardizers, we should refuse to
give a centimeter. Write today's date as 3/5/00 and let the rest of
the world complain about us being out of date, out of step, out of
time and out of sorts. So what if we miss a few appointments? We
will be striking a blow for dialectical uniqueness, iconoclastic
individuality, national sovereignty and international confusion.

 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Half of the potential first ladies in this year's presidential
election have experienced depression or drug abuse.
</P>
<P>
   The usually upbeat Tipper Gore was treated for depression in
1989, after her son was hit by a car and nearly killed. Cindy
McCain got hooked on Percoset and Vicodin, both prescription
painkillers, while being treated for back and knee pain. She began
filching the pills from a medical charity she ran, until, under
investigation by the Drug Enforcement Administration, she 'fessed
up in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Why do so many actual or potential first ladies seem to need
chemical assistance for emotional uplift? Think of Joan Kennedy
with her alcohol, Betty Ford with her pills, and Kitty Dukakis with
her rubbing alcohol.
</P>
<P>
   Even women usually thought of as thoroughly functional have
flirted with dysfunction. Jackie Kennedy relied on a Dr. Feelgood
to inject her (and her husband) with vitamins and amphetamines.
Barbara Bush sank into despair after her last child left home and
her husband went to work for the CIA, which requires a man to be
even vaguer than usual about what happened today at the office,
dear.
</P>
<P>
   The typical explanation is that it's tough to be the wife of a
politician. You drop everything to help your husband get elected,
and if you're successful, your reward is to be trapped on the wrong
end of the public microscope. Oddly enough, this brings up a few
questions (and answers) regarding the reasons for living this
lifestyle.
</P>
<P>
   How hard is it to be a candidate's or president's wife? This is
really two questions. First, do politicians' wives have a difficult
job, and second, are the emotional demands on them unusually
intense?
</P>
<P>
   Being a candidate's wife can be a physical strain, particularly
during a campaign. Campaigning involves an exhausting amount of
travel, speaking publicly over and over again, sitting straight and
looking interested while others drone on, shaking an uncountable
number of hands, and eating disgusting quantities of inedible food.
But all this is no more, and probably less, than the candidate
himself has to put up with.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, a candidate's wife's emotional life does require a
special kind of fortitude. First, she has to be alone a lot. Few
politicians make it home for dinner, since they do most of their
fundraising after-hours, either at dinners or speaking engagements.
</P>
<P>
   Second, whatever her actual personality, she has to create the
illusion that she's the wife in the representative couple that
voters and pundits appear to want her and her husband to be.
</P>
<P>
   To avoid the fate of Eleanor Roosevelt, Rosalynn Carter, Betty
Ford, Hillary Clinton, and even, at times, Nancy Reagan, the wife
must present herself as a helpmeet. But a pleasant and attractive
and supportive helpmeet, not a pushy one. She must neither compete
for his time nor be too involved in his activities.
</P>
<P>
   If she has a career, she should make sure it is as distinct from
his as possible, to avoid charges of nepotism or log-rolling. If
she has political opinions, she should appear to keep them to
herself.
</P>
<P>
   Above all, she must do all this with no power of her own and no
remuneration. This is a pretty big sacrifice for little reward _
the royal road to marital frustration.
</P>
<P>
   So why do women do it? One could speculate that there are types
of women (and men) drawn to politicians _ let's call them
masochists _ just as there are types of men and women drawn to
politics, most of whom were or wanted to be their class president.
Masochism is linked to a tendency to succumb to depression, and
depression is linked to abuse of prescription drugs and alcohol,
and so on and so forth.
</P>
<P>
   Like all psychosocial generalizations, though, this explanation
is inadequate in two ways: It doesn't explain the exceptions, and
it may reverse cause and effect. It could be that politicians'
wives develop a taste for masochism _ or drugs _ as a response to
their situation. What if they married before he entered politics
and before she understood what being a politician's wife would
entail?
</P>
<P>
   Calling her a masochist amounts to asking why she doesn't leave,
which displays a limited grasp of the complexity of human
motivations. (This is why demanding that Hillary leave Bill has
always seemed so silly.) What if she loves him and doesn't want to
destroy his career? What if she doesn't believe in divorce? What if
she's afraid of losing the custody battle?
</P>
<P>
   So she should drink or pop pills instead? This is not as crazy
as it sounds. Look at it this way. Your options are 1) leave your
husband and ruin his career; 2) stay with your husband but
demonstrate your frustration in a way that hurts him politically;
or 3) stay with your husband and drug yourself to make it bearable.
</P>
<P>
   Guess what? No. 3 is the option that requires the least
sacrifice by all parties.
</P>
<P>
   But there's another twist: If it came out that the wife was
drinking or taking drugs, that would hurt her husband and turn No.
3 into a variant of No. 2. So No. 3 works only if secrecy is
assured. Since that's impossible in today's media climate, No. 3 is
a difficult course to pursue. But if it's successful, it's still
the best one.
</P>
<P>
   Are presidential couples really required to purvey a
soul-destroying fiction to the American public? If you believe Gil
Troy, a historian of presidential couples and the author of
``Affairs of State: The Rise and Rejection of the Presidential
Couple Since World War II,'' the answer is yes.
</P>
<P>
   Troy is astute about the impossibility of the first lady's
position: ``First Ladies have become prime political targets,
attacked, ridiculed, and grilled about their childhoods, their
child rearing, their marriages, their fashions and their
philosophies. It is a thankless task.''
</P>
<P>
   However, unlike other commentators on the modern presidential
marriage, Troy argues that the ``co-presidency,'' as he calls it,
is less the product of feminism and the belief that ``the personal
is political'' than of the mass media, with its emphasis on the
personalities of celebrities.
</P>
<P>
   As he sees it, the real job of the political spouse isn't to
provide a foil for the endless conversation about sex roles. It is
to do for her husband what the party used to do for candidates,
``helping to define the country's leader in an accessible and
standard shorthand.''
</P>
<P>
   And yet, he notes, no matter how much Americans have come to
expect a first lady by the side of the president, we are equally
insistent that we don't want anyone to wield power whom we haven't
elected. Any woman seen to usurp her husband's presidential
prerogatives will immediately witness a drop in her _ and her
husband's _ popularity.
</P>
<P>
   Troy's solution to this is not to fight it: ``Don't be
yourselves; be who they want you to be.'' ``The less power you seem
to want, the more you'll get and the more popular you shall be.''
``When in doubt, go retro.''
</P>
<P>
   Being something of a tragic realist, Troy goes so far as to
conclude that the lies required to create an idealized political
marriage are a social necessity. They are, he says, ``useful
fictions,'' in that they provide the American public with the role
models needed to fight the cynicism he says prevails about both
marriage and democracy today.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, others are less pessimistic. Andrew Sullivan
thinks that first ladies such as Bill Bradley's wife, literature
professor Ernestine Schlant, are the way to go _ that is that first
ladies should have their own careers.
</P>
<P>
   Margaret Talbot and Germaine Greer want to get rid of first
ladies altogether, at least as currently conceived _ which is, as
Talbot puts it, ``as so much glorified arm candy.''
</P>
<P>
   The problem with both these suggestions is that they're
implausible. We won't know how the public would react to Schlant as
first lady, since Bradley seems doomed. But the first lady today
does have several specific and time-consuming tasks, mostly
involving entertaining, which would make it nearly impossible for
Schlant to maintain a full course load or to publish monographs
while her husband was in the White House.
</P>
<P>
   It's even harder to imagine how we could force media outlets to
stop treating first ladies as ``arm candy'' or demanding intimate
revelations of them. The media's appetite for what Troy calls
``shorthand'' only grows. Given the fierce competition, no
presidential candidate is likely to unilaterally disarm by
campaigning without his wife.
</P>
<P>
   Troy may be overestimating the social utility of illusions _
they seem as likely to produce cynicism as to quell it _ but he's
right about the media's insistence on them. Rather than demand the
unthinkable, perhaps we should federally finance tranquilizers
instead.

Sherwin B. Nuland, whose book ``The Mysteries Within: A Surgeon

published, is clinical professor of surgery at Yale University.

<TEXT>
<P>
   For a brief period during my years of surgical training in the
late 1950s, I worked under a tough-minded senior resident who
conducted what he called ``narcotic rounds'' every evening just
before midnight. The purpose of the former Army medic's solitary
nocturnal perambulations through the wards was to decrease, or
sometimes cancel, the dosages of post-operative pain medication
that junior members of his team had ordered during the day. Should
any of us have the temerity to reinstate those dosages the
following morning, the miscreant was sure to be subjected to a
string of invective, ``lily livered'' being the least indelicate of
the terms he used. The ex-sergeant's message to us was that all
complaints of pain were exaggerated, if not phony.
</P>
<P>
   One day, 20 years later, a nurse refused to administer the
Demerol I had ordered for a patient with advanced cancer, pointing
out that the dosage was significantly higher than usual and the
frequency approximately twice what was recommended in the hospital
drug manual. She and the head nurse who supported her decision
could not be persuaded to relent, even when I remonstrated that the
prescribed amount was standard in our local hospice. It took the
intervention of their supervisor to convince them that the
patient's pain could not otherwise be brought under control.
</P>
<P>
   More than a decade would pass before an increasing body of
literature on symptom relief made it clear that pain is commonly
undertreated in American hospitals. Recently, two scientists at the
State University of New York in Albany were granted a patent for a
computerized system of measuring pain. Whether or not it is
effective remains to be seen.
</P>
<P>
   The two reasons most often cited for patients suffering pain
unnecessarily involve the patients themselves and the professionals
who care for them. It must have come as a disagreeable surprise to
my obdurate former resident when he read in one journal after
another that many sick people are too stoic for their own good, or
at least reluctant to ask for sufficient relief lest they be
thought not stoic enough. Physicians and nurses underestimate the
severity of pain, particularly when it is at its most intense.
Comprehending the magnitude of pain that accompanies some medical
conditions is very difficult for those who have not themselves
suffered. Samuel Johnson, a man accustomed to discomforts of all
sorts, said 250 years ago, ``Those who do not feel pain seldom
think that it is felt.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the several difficulties inherent in the misapprehensions
about the treatment of pain is the troublesome fact that there has
never been any accurate way to measure its severity. Neurologists
and researchers depend on rather simplistic pain intensity scales
based on patients' verbal reports or the choice they make from a
graded sequence such as 1 to 10 or its equivalent. The situation is
far from ideal.
</P>
<P>
   But all of this is said to be changing with the new method
developed by Dr. A. Vania Apkarian, a neuroscientist at SUNY's
Upstate Medical University in Syracuse, and Dr. Nikolaus
Szeverenyi, a radiological physicist at SUNY in Albany. Volunteers
in their studies are subjected to varying degrees of discomfort,
and their brains' responses are recorded on an electroencephalogram
or imaged by a CT scan or MRI.
</P>
<P>
   But even with such a complex assortment of electronic gadgetry,
results depend ultimately on the subjects' description of the
degree of pain they feel, which is signaled by how far they
separate their opposed thumb and forefinger. The researchers
believe that they can correlate the characteristics of the brain
patterns with the quantity of pain the patient reports in such a
way that the images or electroencephalographic tracings can then be
used as an unbiased and therefore accurate indicator of a patient's
discomfort. Interpretations made in this way, the patent document
states, create a ``quantitative analysis to characterize the
brain's representation of pain.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BC-PAIN-TREATMENT-REVIEW-2NDTAKE-NYT &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; UNDATED: of pain.''  &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Sounds good, doesn't it? The trouble is that the more experience
physicians have with the diagnosis and treatment of pain, the more
skeptical they are likely to be about the usefulness of the newly
developed technology.
</P>
<P>
   There is a reason for the present lack of objectivity in pain
measurement: The quality measured is in itself not objective. For
example, a pinprick delivered with a measurable amount of pressure
will produce widely differing perceptions among a group of subjects
of differing personality characteristics, or even when applied at
different times in the same individual, as surrounding conditions
change or even as mood alters. We feel pain in various ways at
various times, depending on who we are and the circumstances under
which it occurs.
</P>
<P>
   Not only that, but even were it possible to make the perceptions
exactly the same among a diverse group of people, the ability of
each to tolerate similar degrees of perceived pain would vary
considerably. In other words, both the amount of pain one feels and
the ability to tolerate it are the result of a mix of factors, the
subjective or intangible among which are at least as significant as
the physical or chemical.
</P>
<P>
   The symptom of pain has multiple dimensions. Its diagnosis,
measurement and treatment are so complex that scientists and
clinicians in vast numbers have turned their attention to its many
aspects, and organized themselves in the International Association
for the Study of Pain.
</P>
<P>
   Even the meaning of the word is entangled with uncertainty, and
the group has constructed a working definition: ``an unpleasant
sensation and emotional experience associated with either actual or
potential tissue damage, or described in terms of such damage.''
This means that those most qualified to study pain recognize it not
only as a ``sensation'' but also as an ``emotional experience,''
including the realization that even the ``sensation'' part of it is
to a large extent determined by the emotional circumstances in
which it occurs.
</P>
<P>
   Patent or no patent, it will be decades before the technology is
developed that can reliably quantify emotion and measure its
contribution to the calculus of a sick person's pain.
</P>
<P>
   The old sergeant died about 10 years ago. I am told that he bore
a difficult final illness with forebearance and a determination not
to show outward signs of suffering. I hope his doctors and nurses
were more sensitive than he had been. I hope they went to great
lengths to relieve the anguish of body and mind that he was never
able to acknowledge, whether in himself or others.

   TEHRAN, Iran _ The best-selling books here these days are all by
jailbirds. Among the hottest are the bound transcripts of defense
arguments from the trials of an iconoclast Muslim cleric, Abdullah
Nouri, and the activist former mayor of Tehran, Gholamhossein
Karbaschi. Even the essays of the journalist and erstwhile
hostage-taker Abbas Abdi _ the same ones that landed him in prison
when he published them in his magazine last year _ have been
reprinted in paperback and fly off the shelves of Tehran's busy
book shops.
</P>
<P>
   The reactionary mullahs who arrested these new darlings of the
publishing world must rue the day they decided to muzzle their
critics with a few political show trials. The liberalization of
society they so feared had already advanced too far. Persecution
only made the reformers louder and more popular.
</P>
<P>
   United by little more than antagonism toward the insular
clerics, the self-styled reformers have now gained strength
following their victory in the first round of parliamentary
elections on Feb. 18. Their movement is partly a backlash against a
clerical cartel that has ruled the country, in one form or another,
since the 1979 Islamic revolution. During that time, this cartel
has moved to stifle change through arrests and violence.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a victory for progressives, but they are progressives
in the Iranian context,'' said a veteran Middle-Eastern diplomat in
Tehran last week. ``They come from within the system and although
they have adopted nationalist slogans, they are fighting the old
fight of who is the most pure revolutionary and the most Islamic of
the clerics.''
</P>
<P>
   By expanding into all levels of society, the hard-line guardians
of the old theocratic order may have planted the seeds of their own
election defeat. They have not only drawn political fire from the
larger society for their actions _ and inaction _ on social issues;
they have also created a competition among themselves. They have
turned from passive religious guardians before the revolution to
activists jealous of each other's grip on power. And by making
loyalty to the revolution a litmus test, they have also invited
scrutiny of their own ideals and interpretations of what the
revolution promised.
</P>
<P>
   In effect, the revolution that gave the clerics power created a
new class of politicians. This class includes not only the
traditional clerical elite, but also opponents of absolute clerical
rule.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the clerics come from Islamic centers like Qum, the most
prominent city for theological study in Iran. Qum produced
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, the founder of the revolution, and the
moderate cleric, Mohammad Khatami, the country's president and the
icon of the democratic movement. The Qum system elevates some
clerics over others by conferring various ranks including the
highest, grand ayatollah. Each scholar elevated by his peers
becomes an autonomous force, with his own students and followers
taken with his particular interpretation of Islamic law.
</P>
<P>
   But Qum's schools no longer graduate only theoreticians of
Islamic jurisprudence, as they did for centuries when religion was
the property of mullahs and government the purview of kings. Nor do
they mainly produce revolutionaries, as they did in the waning
years of the shah. Now the schools also teach computers,
accounting, business management and political science. Since they
have created positions for themselves in the regime, they also
produce Iran's bureaucrats, politicians and critics.
</P>
<P>
   The current calls for change are coming as much from Qum and
other theological centers as they are from the non-clerical public.
To a large degree, the outcome that some ayatollahs feared after
the revolution _ that political involvement would tarnish the
prestige of religious leaders _ has come to pass. In the
parliamentary elections, not one cleric was elected to any of the
three Qum seats. All the winners are technocrats or university
professors.
</P>
<P>
   The competition among politicized clerics has inevitably
produced a power struggle between insiders and outsiders. Nouri,
the jailed cleric who was convicted of apostasy for questioning the
political status quo, was very much on the inside for much of his
career. He was interior minister in the government of Ali Akbar
Hashemi Rafsanjani and previously Khomeini's representative in the
powerful Revolutionary Guards. His anti-establishment credentials
solidified relatively recently, after parliamentary conservatives
forced him out of Rafsanjani's cabinet.
</P>
<P>
   The voices for change in Iran are also coming from those who
were active in the revolution and after but, like Nouri, have spent
the last few years as outcasts. Abdi, one of the intellectuals of
the movement, was a leader of the students who seized the U.S.
Embassy in Tehran in 1979.
</P>
<P>
   With Rafsanjani's presidency, Abdi was put aside to placate the
increasingly threatened conservatives. Khatami himself resigned
under pressure in 1992 after serving as one of the country's most
liberal-minded culture ministers.
</P>
<P>
   Now the revolution's outcasts are back and those who slighted
them are in their sights.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the reformers sharply criticize Rafsanjani as a betrayer
of the revolution who caved in to the conservatives on cultural,
political and economic issues. Yet it was Rafsanjani who first
tried to face down the hard-liners, hiring Khatami to run the state
propaganda machine and oversee culture at a time when Iran was
rebuilding after its devastating war with Iraq. Although he later
backed down, Rafsanjani's legacy is the flowering of free
expression seen in Tehran's book shops today.
</P>
<P>
   Khatami, who speaks engagingly of civil liberties and a dialogue
of civilizations, was swept into office in 1997 because he engaged
the pent-up energies of masses of young people and women. The loose
coalition of ex-revolutionaries, political exiles and religious
nationalists who ran for the parliament under the Khatami banner
this month appealed to a public that has no memory of the
revolution but has tired of enduring ideological battles. As many
Iranians said in conversations before and after the elections,
ordinary people want a normal life that includes religion and
politics, but is not ruled by either.

   BEIJING _ ``Who lost Taiwan?''
</P>
<P>
   Imagine that the year is 2010 and that this headline is
screeching from the People's Daily. China's Communist Party
newspaper is pillorying the gang of traitors who allowed the
nation's hallowed patrimony to be severed.
</P>
<P>
   The scenario could go something like this: Hu Jintao, now
president, Communist Party chief and chairman of the Central
Military Commission, is the main scapegoat. He is in secret
detention and the newspaper is calling for him to be tried for
treason, along with several top generals and diplomats.
</P>
<P>
   By 2010, the People's Liberation Army was supposed to have been
able to take Taiwan by force, if it had come to that. But then the
Taiwanese, fed up with years of threats from Beijing and encouraged
by the ever deeper military ties mandated by the U.S. Congress,
finally voted to become independent.
</P>
<P>
   And when the moment of truth came, after losing an initial
battle in offshore islands to dazzling U.S. technology, ashen-faced
Chinese generals concluded that the opposing forces were simply too
overwhelming to continue.
</P>
<P>
   So: Who Lost Taiwan?
</P>
<P>
   The question isn't being asked yet, of course, but imagining a
day when it might be must be horrifying for China's leaders. For in
China's history-laden politics, almost nothing matters more than
the idea that Taiwan will eventually return to the motherland,
especially now that Hong Kong and Macau are back in its bosom. And
this emotional truth may help outsiders interpret the White Paper
the Chinese leaders issued last week, warning more explicitly than
before that Taiwan's foot-dragging in negotiations, let alone any
declaration of independence, could force China to take ``drastic
measures.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a growing sense of urgency in Beijing that Taiwan
independence will not be the result of a dramatic declaration, but
of a gradual drift towards that goal as the island plays for
time,'' said Steven M. Goldstein, a political scientist at Smith
College.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thus, in a collective leadership it has become imperative not
only not to be the leader who lost Taiwan, but not to be the leader
who allows this slow drift to continue,'' Goldstein said.
</P>
<P>
   The White Paper was obviously intended to influence Taiwan's
March 18 presidential elections. Americans have noted how ill-timed
it was in other ways _ appearing just as Congress is taking up
China's trade status and a bill to strengthen military ties with
Taiwan _ but it responded to some perfectly rational political
imperatives in Beijing. And despite its belligerence, the report
also contains terms for talks that by China's lights must seem so
generous that they could be rejected only by an evil schemer _ like
the current Taiwanese president, Lee Teng-hui, who has outraged the
Chinese with his brinkmanship and his assertion of Taiwan's right
to deal with China in a ``state to state relationship,'' implying
equal status.
</P>
<P>
   Who knows whether President Jiang Zemin and other leaders really
believe it when they say that most ``compatriots'' in Taiwan yearn
for reunification, or when they say they are willing to risk a
dreadful war? But they certainly don't want to be forced into a
conflict that could destroy all they have built on the mainland.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, with hard-line military officers hovering and
their own rhetoric pumping up the people, they cannot watch idly as
Taiwan escapes. So the most important thing is to keep the dream
alive. As long as it survives, so can their careers.
</P>
<P>
   Mao Tse-tung once said that China would wait 100 years to
recover Taiwan if it had to, Whiting noted. Jiang has never set a
deadline, in public at least. Nor does the report, with its warning
against ``indefinite'' delays in negotiations. The day that China
feels compelled to box itself in with a concrete deadline may be
the day for really serious worry.
</P>
<P>
   Notably, the new report does not even mention Taiwan's elections
or the prospective new presidents. Rather, it demonizes the
outgoing Lee. By presenting him as the chief culprit, the Chinese
are making room for a fresh start _ but also putting the would-be
successors on notice that they would repeat Lee's performance at
Taiwan's peril.
</P>
<P>
   Taiwan's own domestic politics may not allow much slippage from
the brinkman's position staked out by Lee. But it is already clear,
in the election campaign now under way, that all three candidates
are searching for modest areas of common interest. Finessing
language about ``one China'' and ``sovereignty'' will be trickier,
especially for the opposition candidate Chen Shui-bian, whose
supporters lean more to independence.
</P>
<P>
   Any question can be discussed under the ``one China''
principle,'' the new report said, repeating the offer of better
terms than Hong Kong got. Not only could Taiwan keep its capitalist
economy, but ``the central government will not send troops or
administrative personnel to be stationed in Taiwan.''
</P>
<P>
   To Chinese who take reunification for granted, this seems like
an incredibly good offer. But the Taiwanese, reveling in democracy
and a prosperous economy, are acutely aware of the implicit
assumptions. ``We are electing a president here, not a governor,''
one official said.
</P>
<P>
   Any negotiations will be plagued by agonizing wordplay and
status issues, but Taiwan needs to find creative ways to keep the
Chinese talking, it seems clear from last week's report. So long as
they are talking, they will not be shooting. And nobody in Beijing
will be asking who lost Taiwan.

   Keeping a Stiff Upper Lip During the Barrage
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I'm going to win the presidency, really,'' Gov. George
W. Bush told a reporter on the day after a 6-point loss to Sen.
John McCain in the Michigan primary. Under the circumstances, he
sounded like one of the heroic optimists who got London through the
blitz.
</P>
<P>
   How to weather the insurgent barrage of McCain, whose clean
sweep Tuesday also included his home state of Arizona, was a matter
of growing concern for the Bush campaign, which has already spent
$60 million and has beaten McCain in only one fully engaged
head-to-head contest, South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   McCain won the open Michigan primary thanks to independents and
blue-collar voters, moderates and suburbanites. What he didn't get
was many Republicans: only 29 percent of Republican voters cast
ballots for McCain, which could spell trouble for him on Super
Tuesday, March 7, when primaries in crucial states like New York
and California will not allow crossover voting.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a conservative record in Congress, McCain, because of
his unorthodox positions on issues like campaign finance reform, is
being viewed by voters as a progressive alternative to Bush,
alienating the party's conservative base. To win back support on
the right, McCain is proclaiming in a new commercial running in
California, ``I'm a proud Reagan Republican.''
</P>
<P>
   Which is practically the label Bill Bradley tried to hang last
week on his Democratic opponent, Vice President Al Gore. In a
feisty debate Monday at the Apollo Theater in New York City's
Harlem, Bradley all but shoved a copy of Gore's congressional
voting record in his face in an effort to show Democrats that the
vice president has been far more right-leaning on abortion and gun
control than they think.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's insurgent campaign, overshadowed by McCain's, is
making a stand in Washington state in anticipation of the primary
there Tuesday. His concentration in a state that is essentially
holding a beauty contest shows how critical it has become for
Bradley to win a primary somewhere, anywhere.

<P>
   But Will It Have Toll Booths? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Maybe they'll call it the Ho Chi Minh Highway. In a hopeful
lunge at development, Vietnam announced it would carve a
north-south road through its western mountains along the route of
the former Ho Chi Minh Trail.
</P>
<P>
   That trail _ really a shifting network of hidden supply routes
that snaked in and out of neighboring Laos and Cambodia _ was one
of the wonders of the Vietnam War, one more proof of the
persistence and ingenuity of North Vietnam's guerrilla fighters.
</P>
<P>
   The brilliance of the new plan is a little more difficult to
embrace. Vietnam already has a north-south route, Highway 1, that
runs along the coast through most of its major cities. The new
road, while presumably avoiding the old trail's detours into its
neighbors' territory, would still travel 1,000 miles through
remote, difficult mountain terrain.
</P>
<P>
   And it would tax Vietnam's treasury at an announced cost of some
$678.6 million in a country that lacks basic resources and is
struggling to pull itself up from poverty.
</P>
<P>
   The very notion of building a jungle highway in three years
might seem unrealistic. But for Vietnamese officials, who are
struggling through a long, discouraging economic slump, the allure
of the trail's symbolism may be irresistible. Once again, they can
mobilize the masses and, with patriotic fervor, show the world what
they can do.

   Signals on Interest Rates Confuse the Stock Markets  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street went through a confusing week, with the Dow Jones
industrial average losing 3.5 percent and closing below 10,000 for
the first time in 10 months. Its performance contrasted with the
technology-dominated Nasdaq composite index, which is up 12.81
percent this year and which showed a small gain for the week. The
divergence seemed to reflect expectations that the Federal Reserve
will continue raising interest rates, and that this will hurt
traditional companies more than it will hurt new technology
companies, since the Old Economy organizations are more dependent
on bank loans for raising capital.
</P>
<P>
   A Finger Is Pointed At Milosevic
</P>
<P>
   The Yugoslav president, Slobodan Milosevic, has been making life
difficult for NATO peacekeepers in the troubled Kosovo city of
Kosovska-Mitrovica. NATO and Clinton administration officials
acknowledged they had intercepted radio transmissions between Serbs
in the northern part of Mitrovica and Milosevic's security police
in Serbia proper. As well, Milosevic has been sending plainclothes
police into the city to help train and encourage Serb militants who
want to expel the remaining Albanians in northern Mitrovica. NATO
commanders vowed they would ensure the return of Albanian residents
who fled their homes in the north. Whether that can happen seems
likely to be a fundamental test of the administration's Kosovo
policy.

   With globalization making it as easy for the mob as it is for

in pursuit of the Russian mafia _ really, a collection of mafias _
whose tentacles have spread globally and now reach into Brighton
Beach, South Miami, Philadelphia and Los Angeles. When the mob
leaders are not in Moscow, they have been hanging out in Budapest,
a pleasant city on the Danube and a fine way station on the path to
Western Europe. So that is where, next month, the FBI will be
opening its first full-fledged office beyond U.S. shores.

   Aiming to boost teachers' salaries _ and status _ Education
Secretary Richard Riley proposed that teaching become a year-round
profession. He left to states and school districts the question of
whether to extend the school calendar for students as well, but
said teachers need more professional development in this era of
high-technology and high-stakes testing, ``The educational paradigm
of the factory age is no longer appropriate,'' the secretary said

the state of American education.

   Psychiatric Drugs for Tots
</P>
<P>
   A study published in the Journal of the American Medical
Association reported a ``troubling'' rise in the number of
preschool children being medicated with stimulants, antidepressants
and other psychiatric drugs. From 1991 to 1995, it found,
stimulants including methylphenidate, the generic form of Ritalin,
increased two to three times for children aged 2 to 4 in the
programs studied, while antidepressant use doubled and the use of
clonidine, a blood pressure drug, also jumped. It was the first
study to document an increase among children younger than 5.
</P>

   Following Moses
</P>
<P>
   In Egypt to follow in the steps of Moses, Pope John Paul II
began his long-awaited spiritual pilgrimage by also retracing
modern religious tensions.
</P>
<P>
   The pope had long hoped to use his visits to biblical sites to
seek reconciliation between Christians, Muslims and Jews. He was
warmly received by Egypt's most authoritative Sunni Muslim leader,
Mohammad Tantawi, but he spent most of his time in Egypt seeking to
smooth relations within the Christian world and renew Vatican
dialogue with Egypt's Coptic Orthodox church, which rejects the
primacy of the pope.

   Curtains for `Cats'
</P>
<P>
   For more than a decade, musicals like ``Les Miserables'' and
``Phantom of the Opera'' have anchored the Broadway industry,
drawing millions of tourists to Times Square and keeping their
theaters lit during even the hardest of times. The specter of a
world without them is harrowing to many who make their living along
the Great White Way.
</P>
<P>
   So an announcement that ``Cats,'' the longest-running show in
Broadway history, would close at the end of June set off a fervent
guessing game among amateur handicappers: which mega-musical might
be the next to shutter? In the meantime, ``Cats'' was enjoying a
renaissance. By week's end, the show had sold more than $1 million
in tickets, making it once again the hottest ticket on Broadway.

last week filed a class action discrimination complaint with the

   Every parent faces the dilemma: Restrict a child too much and

trouble. That conundrum lies at the heart of an acrimonious dispute
in western Michigan over whether Internet access at public
libraries should be restricted to protect children from
pornography. Christian conservatives put the issue to a referendum
there and lost, as some local residents contended that software
filters restricted free speech and would inevitably block access to
some useful sites, too.

   Americans bought an estimated $14 billion or more of recorded
music last year. And music, arguably even more than movies or
television, has been the vanguard of the post-World War II American
cultural onslaught that has swept through the world.
</P>
<P>
   So it's odd, in a way, that the annual Grammy Awards show, which
was broadcast last week to a domestic audience of over 27 million
people, is a kind of musical Land That Time Forgot, a place where,
as they used to say at the Holiday Inn, the best surprise is no
surprise.
</P>
<P>
   This is where the music business tries to place its imprimatur
on the ungovernable energies of American pop culture. ``Old people
_ the Grammy voters _ like to be reminded that the young people
aren't taking over, which is ironic when you're talking about pop
music,'' notes Robert Wilonsky, popular culture critic for the
Dallas Observer.
</P>
<P>
   Wilonsky's observation, given that this is an organization that
awarded Petula Clark a Grammy over the Beatles, makes sense. ``You
can't assume that the Grammys take place in a universe similar to
our own,'' Wilonsky continues. ``The Grammys take place in the
Bizarro Universe.''
</P>
<P>
   What that means is that the Grammys probably won't play the
favorite tunes of a hip 15-year-old California skateboarder, or a
hip-hop crazy girl from East Flatbush, Brooklyn. Instead, you'll
get a snapshot of the sounds that have migrated from the cutting
edge to the mainstream.
</P>
<P>
   This year, with 52-year-old Carlos Santana lugging home eight of
the miniature gramophone statuettes for his album ``Supernatural''
_ one wondered if he was going to somehow pull off a Best New
Artist award _ we learned that age does come before beauty. Sting
walked off with two of the Grammys that Santana wasn't up for, and
Cher and Tony Bennett were also winners in the ceremony. (Best
Female Rock Performance winner Sheryl Crow had the good sense to
thank Santana for not mucking around in her category.)
</P>
<P>
   Santana. Sting. Cher. Will Smith _ the Artist Formerly Known as
the Fresh Prince. Madonna (who won for a collaboration with William
Orbit). Whitney Houston. With the exception of Best New Artist, and
the welcome new blood of the Latin movement, this year's ceremonies
could've taken place in 1987.
</P>
<P>
   And thank God for that. There was apprehension in the music
business this year, that the kids who took all of the tension and
heat out of what Billboard magazine calls Black music _ funk, R &AMP; B
and rap _ and turned it into product, acts like Limp Bizkit and
former New Mouseketeers like Britney Spears, would dominate the
awards.
</P>
<P>
   Santana also represented another, more intriguing trend in this
year's Grammys, the interest in Latin music. Once solely the
province of musician/ethnographers like Ry Cooder, Latin pop now
has grown as a musically and commercially vibrant sector hospitable
to both the heat of youth culture and the grace of age.
</P>
<P>
   The growing acceptance of world music and an exploding Hispanic
demographic presence in much of the country were spurs to its
success, as were the return of salsa and meringue dance clubs. Kids
may go for the flash of party-people like Ricky Martin and Jennifer
Lopez, but they may also find themselves listening to well-regarded
crooners like Marc Anthony, all of whom reach mainstream audiences
by singing in English.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, grown ups will find Ibrahim Ferrer, 72 years old and
a member of the gracefully aging Buena Vista Social Club, singing
and gesturing like he owns the world.
</P>
<P>
   The Buena Vista Social Club didn't just catch on because Wim
Wenders made an engrossing Oscar-nominated documentary film about
them. Instead, this warrior class of musicians, long ago discarded
by Cuban official culture as remnants of the nightclub era of
Batista, the pre-Castro dictator, performed as if they hadn't
missed a day. And their intensely emotional and melodic stew was
released just as Latin dance music was finally starting to catch on
in the mainstream.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the Latin wave has grown so large that the Grammy
people have decided to run a Latin Grammy broadcast later this
year.
</P>
<P>
   This year's Best New Artist, Christina Aguilera, reflects the
Latin revolution, but she's also part of the jailbait-under-glass
syndrome that is somewhat less appealing.
</P>
<P>
   Once upon a time, little girls flocked to Madonna shows, dressed
just like their idol. Now, those girls, exemplified by Aguilera and
Spears, are the performers and are pushing down the age of sexual
suggestiveness in music, just like the rest of our commercial
culture. The bobby-soxers just keep getting younger. In the end,
the snapshot of America this year's Grammy's provided show a
country still dominated by Baby Boomers reluctant to cede center
stage to the sounds and the singers they grew up with. And while
rap music has been safely commoditized, a new and energetic Latin
sound has found a place in the national cacophony. Finally,
children are being told to grow up faster than ever. That's what
the Top 40 charts told us this year.

   It's no longer very hard to enjoy the trappings of a financial
mogul or earn an aristocratic title conveying pomp and privilege.
Just visit the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The Web is filled with outfits that cater to these desires. For
example, type in ``offshoresecrets.com'' and enter a world
promising ``fast, safe, private and affordable offshore services.''
</P>
<P>
   Those services include banking charters in such obscure locales
as Nauru and Vanuatu for a fee of about $20,000. ``Yes! I want to
order my own bank now!'' the site encourages visitors, noting that
such banks allow users to take deposits, give loans and ``operate
free of tax on profit,'' with no ``need to maintain a physical
presence'' in the host country.
</P>
<P>
   To top it off, the site can help you get a college degree or
even a legal title of nobility. ``With a Title in front of your
name you will experience a difference in people's attitudes,'' the
site notes. ``The moment they know you are a `Sir, Lady, Lord,
etc.' you'll be treated like some sort of royalty or famous film
star.''
</P>
<P>
   An individual identified as Eytan Gold, who operates
offshoresecrets.com from Israel, declined to be interviewed.
Neither he nor his site have ever been charged with wrongdoing. But
his site and others like it have drawn the attention of U.S.
regulators and legislators, who suspect they may be fronts for
money laundering and other financial shenanigans.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sole purpose of many of these banks is to provide havens
for criminals,'' said Sen. Charles E. Schumer, D-N.Y., in an
interview. ``Any criminal worth his salt knows that if you want to
avoid detection, you go offshore _ and with the Internet, you can
point, click and launder.''
</P>
<P>
   An estimated $5 trillion to $6 trillion is sheltered in offshore
accounts, according to reports from the International Monetary
Fund, Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co. and the State Department. Schumer and
Sen. Paul Coverdell, R-Ga., have introduced money-laundering
legislation that targets ``instant banks'' being peddled on the
Internet. The legislation would prevent those kinds of banks from
having transactions with U.S. financial institutions.
</P>
<P>
   A glance at one site, offshoreprofit.com, operated from
Venezuela by an individual identified as Lord Antonio D. Gonzalez,
suggests how easy it is for just about anyone to shelter money
abroad. For $399, the site will establish an account in ``one of
Estonia's largest banks'' and throw in a free ``Maestro Card.''
</P>
<P>
   The site's ``Millennium Freedom Package,'' bargain-priced at
$2,299, offers an offshore trust account in Belize, an ``ID Free
Visa card,'' a mail-drop address and a ``full year of personalized
advice'' that includes information on where to get ``a second, or
even third diplomatic passport.''
</P>
<P>
   Another Web site, privacyworld.com, also offers offshore trusts
and bank accounts, ``legal tax avoidance'' services, press or
travel agent identification and international driver's licenses.
</P>
<P>
   For the very ambitious, the site will establish ``anonymous,
bearer share'' corporations that will let owners bank abroad using
encrypted telephone, fax or e-mail connections.
</P>
<P>
   The site, operated from Switzerland by Third World Trading
Corp., says it allows clients to ``get rid of lawyers, spouses,
etc., forever.'' The operators of privacyworld.com could not be
reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Some offshore operators scoff at the notion that they are
selling anything more than a sought-after luxury: privacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Internet makes it easy to protect our and our clients'
privacy,'' an individual calling himself Robert Smith said in an
e-mail response to questions about his site, offshoreprofit.com.
``We are located outside the U.S., our actual location being a
secret to avoid interference and sabotage attempts, which have
destroyed or are in the process of destroying other, more
high-profile offshore operators.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith also observed that most illegal activities occur in
onshore banks. In fact, the biggest money-laundering investigation
in history is underway at the Bank of New York, where $7 billion in
suspect funds from Russia are being examined. The bank has not been
charged with wrongdoing and is cooperating with the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure, some offshore banks and services are used by those who
want to break the law,'' he said. ``However the same thing is true
for onshore banks. In fact, the vast majority of international
money laundering doesn't take place in the Caribbean or in Austria,
but in New York and London. That's where the truly powerful people
launder their money.''
</P>
<P>
   Even if you aren't interested in stashing away money, the sites
point out that many of their products make great gifts. For just
$495 ($795 for couples), offshoresecrets.com will make you a laird,
knecht, viscount or marchioness. And the cachet that comes with
that title, you'll discover, is just priceless.
</P>
<P>
   ``Airlines will often upgrade you,'' the site promises. ``Bank
managers just can't help you enough. It says more about you than a
Gold or Platinum credit card. For personal confidence and
self-esteem a title will change your life for the better.''

THE $12 MILLION MAN: BUCHANAN WAITS FOR THE PARTY TO BEGIN

 By FRANCIS X. CLINES   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ For all the money and fury being invested in the
parallel primary campaigns of the two major parties, there is
another presidential war game going on under the radar, among the
mud-spattered troops of the Reform party slogging through their own
wilderness campaign. Sooner or later, however, the winners of the
Democratic and Republican fights will have to pay attention. For,
barring direct intrusion by Ross Perot himself, the current
expectation among political professionals is that the Reform line
could very well be resurrected this fall by none other than Pat
Buchanan, the turncoat Republican and chronic presidential
candidate.
</P>
<P>
   For the past five months, Buchanan has been quietly laboring to
build his own Reform machine and get a lock on the nomination. No
small attraction in his quest is the $12.6 million federal election
subsidy that is the Reform nominee's entitlement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Buchanan's waiting in the weeds for the primaries to end,''
said Jim Jordan, a Democratic campaign strategist who anticipates
serious tri-corner mischief if Buchanan manages to seize the third
line. ``Pat knows how to use a political wedge better than anybody
in the business,'' Jordan added, wondering, for example, whether
the GOP's right-wing Christian bloc might become miffed enough in
the current Republican fray to be tempted by a Buchanan alternative
in November.
</P>
<P>
   Following Minnesota Gov. Jesse Ventura's angry departure from
the party, speculation is growing that Perot might try to dictate a
nominee. But Buchanan, deep into Reform politics by now, insists he
is ready for any eventuality, including recent speculation that
Perot might seek to give his party's blessing to Sen. John McCain,
or that Perot might decide to run again himself.
</P>
<P>
   More an impulse than an organization, the party that Perot built
is out of season right now, shards of ill-managed klatches in 21
states, each hoping for someone to unite it into a once more
fearsome vehicle. The Bush family remembers well that fearsomeness;
President George Bush saw his potential margin of re-election
siphoned off in 1992 when Perot drew 19 percent of the vote to the
Reform line and Bill Clinton was elected as a plurality President.
Now the son, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, is suffering a healthy
dose of insurgency from McCain and neither can afford to focus on
the Perot reformers conspiring on the horizon.
</P>
<P>
   As he retreated, Ventura described the Reform Party as
``hopelessly dysfunctional.'' But actually he was quitting
preemptively, having failed to win the national party leadership.
In a way, the party proved quite functional, for the Perot
loyalists reclaimed the party gavel in Nashville at a raucous
convention shoving match worthy of the Moscow Duma.

welcome all sorts of endorsements, Reformers included, once he wins

laughingstock.

by defeating Bob Dole in the 1996 New Hampshire primary. Buchanan

uncertain Reformers, right down to a bowling alley caucus one night
in Fleetwoods, W.Va.

unrest.

master the wayward politics of his new party. ``It's a volatile
situation in America,'' the newly minted Reformer said, smiling at
the possibilities.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ For all the money and fury being invested in the
parallel primary campaigns of the two major parties, there is
another presidential war game going on under the radar, among the
mud-spattered troops of the Reform party slogging through their own
wilderness campaign. Sooner or later, however, the winners of the
Democratic and Republican fights will have to pay attention. For,
barring direct intrusion by Ross Perot himself, the current
expectation among political professionals is that the Reform line
could very well be resurrected this fall by none other than Pat
Buchanan, the turncoat Republican and chronic presidential
candidate.
</P>
<P>
   For the past five months, Buchanan has been quietly laboring to
build his own Reform machine and get a lock on the nomination. No
small attraction in his quest is the $12.6 million federal election
subsidy that is the Reform nominee's entitlement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Buchanan's waiting in the weeds for the primaries to end,''
said Jim Jordan, a Democratic campaign strategist who anticipates
serious tri-corner mischief if Buchanan manages to seize the third
line. ``Pat knows how to use a political wedge better than anybody
in the business,'' Jordan added, wondering, for example, whether
the GOP's right-wing Christian bloc might become miffed enough in
the current Republican fray to be tempted by a Buchanan alternative
in November.
</P>
<P>
   Following Minnesota Gov. Jesse Ventura's angry departure from
the party, speculation is growing that Perot might try to dictate a
nominee. But Buchanan, deep into Reform politics by now, insists he
is ready for any eventuality, including recent speculation that
Perot might seek to give his party's blessing to Sen. John McCain,
or that Perot might decide to run again himself.
</P>
<P>
   More an impulse than an organization, the party that Perot built
is out of season right now, shards of ill-managed klatches in 21
states, each hoping for someone to unite it into a once more
fearsome vehicle. The Bush family remembers well that fearsomeness;
President George Bush saw his potential margin of re-election
siphoned off in 1992 when Perot drew 19 percent of the vote to the
Reform line and Bill Clinton was elected as a plurality President.
Now the son, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, is suffering a healthy
dose of insurgency from McCain and neither can afford to focus on
the Perot reformers conspiring on the horizon.
</P>
<P>
   As he retreated, Ventura described the Reform Party as
``hopelessly dysfunctional.'' But actually he was quitting
preemptively, having failed to win the national party leadership.
In a way, the party proved quite functional, for the Perot
loyalists reclaimed the party gavel in Nashville at a raucous
convention shoving match worthy of the Moscow Duma.
</P>
<P>
   Reform party enthusiasts heart-stricken at the spectacle should
remember that big money has a way of focusing the attention of even
the most obstreperous politician. And the early teasing about this
prize is ending.

<TEXT>
<P>
   After 22 years as a science writer, I recently retired to cut
firewood in Vermont and enjoy the memories of an exciting life, in
which I covered a half-dozen wars before discovering the deeper
satisfaction of observing and reporting the achievements of
scientists.
</P>
<P>
   I relished my 17 years as a foreign correspondent, but believe
it or not, even the high drama of disaster, violence and political
upheaval that dominates front pages can lose its luster for
journalists seeking new experiences.
</P>
<P>
   After a time, a news writer may begin to sense a kind of
sameness in most of the events that pass as news. When that happens
a lucky few of us discover that in science, almost alone among
human endeavors, there is always something new under the sun.
</P>
<P>
   In 1977, weary of the sameness of war and politics, I returned
to the United States to become a science writer _ a transition that
almost overwhelmed me at first. Although I had earned my living in
a chemical laboratory in the 1950s, I had almost forgotten how
speedily science booms along.
</P>
<P>
   As a trivial example, in the last quarter century alone the
American Chemical Society has added more than 10 million chemical
substances to its list of known molecules, most of them man-made.
Stupendous strides in chemical synthesis have given the world a
wealth of new materials and drugs, and have created entirely new
classes of molecules, including hollow molecules shaped like cages
that contain even smaller molecules. Perhaps most intriguing of
all, chemists are turning up more and more hints of how life may
have originated from the carbon spawned in the explosions of
supernova stars.
</P>
<P>
   The 1960s and '70s were a time of great ferment in all the
sciences, and the momentum of those years has carried to the
present. Among the major achievements in physics I was privileged
to report were the discovery of the top quark at Fermilab _ the
last of six quarks predicted by theory _ and the discovery in Japan
that the elusive neutrino particle probably has some mass, a
finding with profound implications for the fate of the universe.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes science writers watching the accelerating deluge of
discoveries in physics, chemistry, molecular biology and
astrophysics have actually outpaced the thinking of the scientists
themselves, and science writing has bloomed as a major component of
general journalism.
</P>
<P>
   At The New York Times, for example, the science editor, Walter
Sullivan, had been steeping himself in astrophysics for decades
when in 1965 two scientists at Bell Labs, Dr. Arno A. Penzias and
Dr. Robert W. Wilson, accidentally discovered a faint microwave
radio signal coming from all directions in the sky. It was the
first hard evidence that the universe had begun with a ``Big
Bang.''
</P>
<P>
   Penzias later paid Sullivan one of the warmest compliments ever
given a science writer, after reading an article expanding on the
implications of the discovery: ``Only after reading Sullivan's
story in The New York Times,'' Penzias said, ``did we fully
understand what we had done.'' In 1978 Penzias and Wilson, their
discovery having radically changed man's view of the cosmos, were
awarded a Nobel prize.
</P>
<P>
   Sullivan's cosmic microwave article was based on a lifetime of
study _ a requisite for every successful science writer. The raw
material used in news coverage of important discoveries is often
rather skimpy: a press release from some university, a telephone
message from a scientist friend or a brief paper in a professional
journal. It is up to the science writer to judge the significance
of the findings and place them in context.
</P>
<P>
   This means that a science writer must be a perpetual student.
</P>
<P>
   News stories about astronomy frequently have to do with black
holes, for example, and for many astronomy fans it is enough to
know that black holes suck in everything near them and won't let
anything _ even light _ escape. But to understand black holes at a
deeper level requires familiarity with Einstein's general theory of
relativity, and some of the greatest minds in physics are still
puzzling over some of relativity's implications.
</P>
<P>
   The presumably lesser mind of the science writer has an even
harder row to hoe than that of the scientist. But try, he or she
must. Slogging through the dense technical thickets (and perhaps
equations) that envelope some scientific event is not only
important for rounding out an article; it is tremendously
satisfying to the journalist involved, whether he is boning up on
nuclear shell theory, mitochondrial DNA, quantum chromodynamics,
the origin of birds, or whatever.
</P>
<P>
   I believe that conscientious science writers come to know more
things than do other journalists. That is the greatest pleasure of
our calling.
</P>
<P>
   Curiously, as science floods the world with discoveries of
variable quality _ unhappily, the overwhelming majority of
scientific papers fall into the category of junk science _ the task
of the writer seems to grow easier in some ways.
</P>
<P>
   The science itself gets harder all the time, of course. The
professional journals on which scientists (and writers) heavily
depend are not easy to read, and they seem more difficult each
year. To give some idea: several years ago the editor of a
prestigious journal, Physical Review Letters, found it necessary to
decree that at least the first couple of paragraphs of each
published paper should be intelligible to an average Ph.D physicist
not specializing in the subject of the paper.
</P>
<P>
   But no discovery occurs in a vacuum, a fact that has helped many
science writers find their way through the fog. Newton, the
discoverer of much that is essential to modern physics and
mathematics, wrote that he could not have seen so far without
having stood on the shoulders of giants. In a small way, the
science writer can also stand on the shoulders of giants. Most
discoveries are incremental steps, and if a writer comes to terms
with the earlier steps, new findings generally slide into an
intelligible context.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BC-SCIENCE-JOURNALISM-REVIEW-2NDTAKE-NYT &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; UNDATED: intelligible context. &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The science writer also lives in dread of losing readers'
interest, which happens all too often. For instance, it's hard to
persuade a reader (or editor) to take seriously some gigantic
experiment that produced only a null result. So the writer is
obliged to point out that null results can have far-reaching
scientific importance.
</P>
<P>
   The failure of an experiment by Dr. Albert Michelson and Dr.
Edward Morley a century ago to detect the earth's passage through a
hypothetical universal ``ether'' lent powerful support to
relativity theory. Scientists will soon begin a quest for gravity
waves in a strikingly similar experiment, and any writer unfamiliar
with Michelson and Morley's work will have trouble reporting the
story.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, it takes a prepared mind to appreciate the value
of a subtle experiment that may have a null result, and a science
writer must impart this appreciation to readers, even at the cost
of glazing a few eyes.
</P>
<P>
   One trick of the trade is the use of analogy to convey the
flavor of an idea, discovery or equation. But effective though
analogies may be, they are never exactly appropriate and sometimes
are downright wrong. It's probably OK to call a proton a
``beanbag'' containing three quarks, but to call a proton
accelerator an ``atom smasher'' makes physicists squirm.
</P>
<P>
   Practice may not make perfect, but a science writer who stays in
the game long enough is bound to get better. Unfortunately, it can
happen that both the writer and reader may miss the significance of
a scientific development; it is like being knocked down by a strong
opponent.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Gallico, a renowned sports writer in the 1930s, relished
such encounters. Before writing about one of the boxing matches he
covered, Gallico went into the ring with Jack Dempsey, who knocked
him down. This, Gallico said, taught him all he needed to know
about being hit, and that rich experience helped flavor his
coverage.
</P>
<P>
   Science writers and their readers sometimes get knocked down by
hard ideas rather than by hard gloves. But the experience of
grappling with such things as the fiendish mathematics of
superstring theory or the complicated tactics of the AIDS virus is
its own reward, even at the cost of some bumps.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ ``The book is closed on this case,'' the judge said
Friday, moments after an Albany County jury acquitted four New York
City police officers of all charges in the killing of Amadou Diallo
a year ago. That is true only as far as Justice Joseph C. Teresi's
courtroom goes. It may take a while before the book closes, if it
ever does, on the troubled collective conscience of New York and,
perhaps, other corners of America.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since Diallo, an unarmed African immigrant, died in a hail
of 41 police bullets on the doorstep of his Bronx apartment
building, there has been no shortage of shock, anger, sadness and
raw pain.
</P>
<P>
   None of that is likely to disappear just because a jury has
spoken, and far from the scene where this awful incident unfolded.
A young man is needlessly dead _ ``an innocent man and a decent
man,'' said Mayor Rudolph Giuliani after the verdict. And while
lives have been shattered, including those of the officers, no one
has been held accountable. That reality will not be easy for many
to digest.
</P>
<P>
   That isn't to say justice was not done. For those who have faith
in the U.S. jury system, it was. As best as anyone could tell, this
multiracial panel of eight whites and four blacks concluded that
the white officers had diligently gone about their job and fired at
this black man because they honestly, though mistakenly, believed
they were under attack.
</P>
<P>
   It would seem the jurors were less concerned with why the
officers fired a mind-numbing 41 times than with whether they were
justified in shooting bullet No. 1. Their answer was implicitly
yes, which was why they acquitted the officers not only of murder,
but of all the lesser charges, too.
</P>
<P>
   Would a Bronx jury have come to a different decision? More than
likely. The Bronx population is largely black and Hispanic. Albany
County, 160 miles north of New York City, is predominantly white.
Race may not automatically determine destiny, but it comes awfully
close in this country. The trial was moved to Albany by a panel of
appellate judges who ruled that an avalanche of publicity,
including mass demonstrations and the arrests of celebrities and
leading political figures, had rendered a fair hearing impossible
in the Bronx.
</P>
<P>
   But while an acquittal was made more probable by the shift to
Albany, it was not necessarily assured, though critics are bound to
disagree. The dissenters can be expected to compare the Diallo
affair with other notorious trials in which juries freed whites who
killed blacks.
</P>
<P>
   But absent evidence of intellectual or moral bankruptcy on the
part of the jurors, there is no reason to reflexively evoke
memories of Simi Valley, Calif., let alone Neshoba County, Miss.,
in the dark days of civil rights murders.
</P>
<P>
   And yet.
</P>
<P>
   And yet it was hard for many New Yorkers to shake the sense that
this had all come out wrong. Aren't Americans taught from childhood
that actions have consequences?
</P>
<P>
   Yet the only one who bore the consequences in this dreadful
affair was Amadou Diallo, who did nothing wrong, except maybe make
the fatal error of pulling out a wallet the officers said they
mistook for a gun.
</P>
<P>
   Blacks were especially angry, nowhere more so than in the
Soundview section of the Bronx where Diallo lived. Some people held
black wallets aloft and mockingly cried, ``Gun!'' On the tense
streets, it was hard to gainsay those who muttered that a wallet
has a way of looking like nothing more than a wallet when held by a
white man but somehow morphs into a gun in the hands of a black
man.
</P>
<P>
   And the judge's observation notwithstanding, the book is not at
all closed, even in the courts.
</P>
<P>
   The Diallo family will surely pursue civil charges. President
Clinton's Justice Department is thinking about whether to
intervene, a decision that may well become entangled in the Senate
race between Giuliani and Hillary Rodham Clinton. If nothing else,
the officers' jobs are on the line.
</P>
<P>
   The Bronx district attorney, Robert T. Johnson, can count on
being subjected to his share of post-mortems, starting with his
decision to charge the four officers with second-degree murder, a
charge that even many of the New York Police Department's most
severe critics thought from the start was unsustainable.
</P>
<P>
   Nor is the Police Department off the hook.
</P>
<P>
   For many New Yorkers, the central question was not the actions
of these four officers. It was whether the hard-nosed and largely
successful anti-crime strategies championed by Giuliani, which
included the stopping and frisking of thousands upon thousands of
black men on the street, had imbued officers with such a sense of
entitlement and aggression that something like the Diallo killing
was a disaster waiting to happen.
</P>
<P>
   It did.

astrophysics have actually outpaced the thinking of the scientists
themselves, and science writing has bloomed as a major component of
general journalism.
</P>
<P>
   At The New York Times, for example, the science editor, Walter
Sullivan, had been steeping himself in astrophysics for decades
when in 1965 two scientists at Bell Labs, Dr. Arno A. Penzias and
Dr. Robert W. Wilson, accidentally discovered a faint microwave
radio signal coming from all directions in the sky. It was the
first hard evidence that the universe had begun with a ``Big
Bang.''
</P>
<P>
   Penzias later paid Sullivan one of the warmest compliments ever
given a science writer, after reading an article expanding on the
implications of the discovery: ``Only after reading Sullivan's
story in The New York Times,'' Penzias said, ``did we fully
understand what we had done.'' In 1978 Penzias and Wilson, their
discovery having radically changed man's view of the cosmos, were
awarded a Nobel prize.
</P>
<P>
   Sullivan's cosmic microwave article was based on a lifetime of
study _ a requisite for every successful science writer. The raw
material used in news coverage of important discoveries is often
rather skimpy: a press release from some university, a telephone
message from a scientist friend or a brief paper in a professional
journal. It is up to the science writer to judge the significance
of the findings and place them in context.
</P>
<P>
   This means that a science writer must be a perpetual student.
</P>
<P>
   News stories about astronomy frequently have to do with black
holes, for example, and for many astronomy fans it is enough to
know that black holes suck in everything near them and won't let
anything _ even light _ escape. But to understand black holes at a
deeper level requires familiarity with Einstein's general theory of
relativity, and some of the greatest minds in physics are still
puzzling over some of relativity's implications.
</P>
<P>
   The presumably lesser mind of the science writer has an even
harder row to hoe than that of the scientist. But try, he or she
must. Slogging through the dense technical thickets (and perhaps
equations) that envelope some scientific event is not only
important for rounding out an article; it is tremendously
satisfying to the journalist involved, whether he is boning up on
nuclear shell theory, mitochondrial DNA, quantum chromodynamics,
the origin of birds, or whatever.
</P>
<P>
   I believe that conscientious science writers come to know more
things than do other journalists. That is the greatest pleasure of
our calling.
</P>
<P>
   Curiously, as science floods the world with discoveries of
variable quality _ unhappily, the overwhelming majority of
scientific papers fall into the category of junk science _ the task
of the writer seems to grow easier in some ways.
</P>
<P>
   The science itself gets harder all the time, of course. The
professional journals on which scientists (and writers) heavily
depend are not easy to read, and they seem more difficult each
year. To give some idea: several years ago the editor of a
prestigious journal, Physical Review Letters, found it necessary to
decree that at least the first couple of paragraphs of each
published paper should be intelligible to an average Ph.D physicist
not specializing in the subject of the paper.
</P>
<P>
   But no discovery occurs in a vacuum, a fact that has helped many
science writers find their way through the fog. Newton, the
discoverer of much that is essential to modern physics and
mathematics, wrote that he could not have seen so far without
having stood on the shoulders of giants. In a small way, the
science writer can also stand on the shoulders of giants. Most
discoveries are incremental steps, and if a writer comes to terms
with the earlier steps, new findings generally slide into an
intelligible context.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BC-SCIENCE-JOURNALISM-REVIEW-2NDTAKE-NYT &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; UNDATED: intelligible context. &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The science writer also lives in dread of losing readers'
interest, which happens all too often. For instance, it's hard to
persuade a reader (or editor) to take seriously some gigantic
experiment that produced only a null result. So the writer is
obliged to point out that null results can have far-reaching
scientific importance.
</P>
<P>
   The failure of an experiment by Dr. Albert Michelson and Dr.
Edward Morley a century ago to detect the earth's passage through a
hypothetical universal ``ether'' lent powerful support to
relativity theory. Scientists will soon begin a quest for gravity
waves in a strikingly similar experiment, and any writer unfamiliar
with Michelson and Morley's work will have trouble reporting the
story.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, it takes a prepared mind to appreciate the value
of a subtle experiment that may have a null result, and a science
writer must impart this appreciation to readers, even at the cost
of glazing a few eyes.
</P>
<P>
   One trick of the trade is the use of analogy to convey the
flavor of an idea, discovery or equation. But effective though
analogies may be, they are never exactly appropriate and sometimes
are downright wrong. It's probably OK to call a proton a
``beanbag'' containing three quarks, but to call a proton
accelerator an ``atom smasher'' makes physicists squirm.
</P>
<P>
   Practice may not make perfect, but a science writer who stays in
the game long enough is bound to get better. Unfortunately, it can
happen that both the writer and reader may miss the significance of
a scientific development; it is like being knocked down by a strong
opponent.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Gallico, a renowned sports writer in the 1930s, relished
such encounters. Before writing about one of the boxing matches he
covered, Gallico went into the ring with Jack Dempsey, who knocked
him down. This, Gallico said, taught him all he needed to know
about being hit, and that rich experience helped flavor his
coverage.
</P>
<P>
   Science writers and their readers sometimes get knocked down by
hard ideas rather than by hard gloves. But the experience of
grappling with such things as the fiendish mathematics of
superstring theory or the complicated tactics of the AIDS virus is
its own reward, even at the cost of some bumps.

   NEW YORK _ The four New York City police officers who shot an
unarmed African immigrant last year were acquitted of murder
charges Friday. Nevertheless, their testimony was particularly
instructive in one aspect of police-community relations: How police
officers expect you to behave when they confront you.
</P>
<P>
   Speak when asked to speak.
</P>
<P>
   Stop when ordered to stop.
</P>
<P>
   Keep hands in plain view.
</P>
<P>
   And never _ ever _ make any sudden move.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, in recounting that fateful February night in the Bronx
last year, the four white officers still seem baffled by Amadou
Diallo's behavior when they approached the black man outside his
building after midnight. His response, which began when he turned
away and ended when he reached for what they thought was a gun,
sealed his fate _ no matter that he was reaching for his wallet.
</P>
<P>
   The four officers were members of the Street Crime Unit; their
mission was to anticipate crime and, most of all, remove illegal
guns from the street. The plainclothes assignment carried both
considerable power and a measure of danger.
</P>
<P>
   Officer Edward McMellon, one of the defendants, said he
approached Diallo by holding out his badge and asking to have a
word with him. Instead, he said, Diallo, who worked as a street
vendor, turned away and began digging into his pocket.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of the policemen's response say Diallo was probably
frightened by the four strangers, and may have been trying to find
his keys to open the building's door. But Officer Sean Carroll said
he saw it this way: ``I believed he was possibly carrying a firearm
and trying to get away.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm saying, `Police, police, show me your hands,'' Carroll
said. ``He just didn't want to listen.''
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, McMellon said he shouted, ``What are you
doing?''
</P>
<P>
   A slight move here, the appearance of a black object there, and
Diallo was dead, struck by 19 of 41 bullets fired. Bennett Epstein,
Carroll's lawyer, summed it up by saying, ``If he had stopped, this
whole thing would have ended peacefully.''
</P>
<P>
   In the absence of any institutional training of the public, such
police expectations seem based on the assumption that law-abiding
residents _ including Diallo _ have street smarts. Americans, such
expectations infer, have learned how to respond to law enforcement
officers from television programs like ``Law and Order'' and ``NYPD
Blue.'' (Of course, the police on these shows are often heroic, the
residents usually suspicious.)
</P>
<P>
   But such expectations have long played havoc with the minds, if
not the lives, of black and Hispanic residents. Parents routinely
instruct their children to obey every police command _ a lesson
less commonly taught in mostly white suburbs. Several years ago,
the NAACP, Allstate Insurance Co. and the National Organization of
Black Law Enforcement Executives published a brochure on
``guidelines for interacting with law enforcement officials.''
</P>
<P>
   Bill Perkins, a New York city councilman whose district includes
a part of Harlem, said he has directed his 18-year-old son to be
extremely careful when dealing with police _ a perversion, he says,
of the traditional view that a police officer is a friend and
protector.
</P>
<P>
   ``He might think, `Let me get my ID out right away,''' Perkins
said, ``and that could lead to him getting shot. That's dangerous.
And I'm not talking about criminal kids. I'm talking about average
kids. Like Diallo.''
</P>
<P>
   David Paterson, a state senator from Harlem, said the police
officers' expectations in the Diallo incident were in full play
even before they left their car. In addition to a preconceived
notion that Diallo was armed, he said, ``the police had an
expectation in street clothes that they should be treated as if
they had their uniforms on.''
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Paterson said, ``Everything that he did, every
motion that he took, was taken by them to be antagonistic.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Robert J. Louden, a former New York police officer and the
director of the Criminal Justice Center at John Jay College of
Criminal Justice, said law enforcement is based on the basic
premise that society gives the police certain powers over the rest
of the population.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have people who are put into positions of authority,'' he
said, ``and the rest of us are supposed to heed them and seek
resolution in the courts.''
</P>
<P>
   To counter the potential for abuse or accidents, police officers
are trained in how to talk to people _ how to approach, for
example, the driver of a car pulled over for speeding. But Louden
acknowledged that people are not trained in how to be stopped by
the police.
</P>
<P>
   ``We teach police what we want them to do and in a way we expect
citizens to do what the police tell them,'' Louden said.
``Sometimes it is implied in the law and often it is explicit in
the law. Unfortunately, it doesn't always work that way.''

   NEW YORK _ ``The book is closed on this case,'' the judge said
Friday, moments after an Albany County jury acquitted four New York
City police officers of all charges in the killing of Amadou Diallo
a year ago. That is true only as far as Justice Joseph C. Teresi's
courtroom goes. It may take a while before the book closes, if it
ever does, on the troubled collective conscience of New York and,
perhaps, other corners of America.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since Diallo, an unarmed African immigrant, died in a hail
of 41 police bullets on the doorstep of his Bronx apartment
building, there has been no shortage of shock, anger, sadness and
raw pain.
</P>
<P>
   None of that is likely to disappear just because a jury has
spoken, and far from the scene where this awful incident unfolded.
A young man is needlessly dead _ ``an innocent man and a decent
man,'' said Mayor Rudolph Giuliani after the verdict. And while
lives have been shattered, including those of the officers, no one
has been held accountable. That reality will not be easy for many
to digest.
</P>
<P>
   That isn't to say justice was not done. For those who have faith
in the U.S. jury system, it was. As best as anyone could tell, this
multiracial panel of eight whites and four blacks concluded that
the white officers had diligently gone about their job and fired at
this black man because they honestly, though mistakenly, believed
they were under attack.
</P>
<P>
   It would seem the jurors were less concerned with why the
officers fired a mind-numbing 41 times than with whether they were
justified in shooting bullet No. 1. Their answer was implicitly
yes, which was why they acquitted the officers not only of murder,
but of all the lesser charges, too.
</P>
<P>
   Would a Bronx jury have come to a different decision? More than
likely. The Bronx population is largely black and Hispanic. Albany
County, 160 miles north of New York City, is predominantly white.
Race may not automatically determine destiny, but it comes awfully
close in this country. The trial was moved to Albany by a panel of
appellate judges who ruled that an avalanche of publicity,
including mass demonstrations and the arrests of celebrities and
leading political figures, had rendered a fair hearing impossible
in the Bronx.
</P>
<P>
   But while an acquittal was made more probable by the shift to
Albany, it was not necessarily assured, though critics are bound to
disagree. The dissenters can be expected to compare the Diallo
affair with other notorious trials in which juries freed whites who
killed blacks.
</P>
<P>
   But absent evidence of intellectual or moral bankruptcy on the
part of the jurors, there is no reason to reflexively evoke
memories of Simi Valley, Calif., let alone Neshoba County, Miss.,
in the dark days of civil rights murders.
</P>
<P>
   And yet.
</P>
<P>
   And yet it was hard for many New Yorkers to shake the sense that
this had all come out wrong. Aren't Americans taught from childhood
that actions have consequences?
</P>
<P>
   Yet the only one who bore the consequences in this dreadful
affair was Amadou Diallo, who did nothing wrong, except maybe make
the fatal error of pulling out a wallet the officers said they
mistook for a gun.
</P>
<P>
   Blacks were especially angry, nowhere more so than in the
Soundview section of the Bronx where Diallo lived. Some people held
black wallets aloft and mockingly cried, ``Gun!'' On the tense
streets, it was hard to gainsay those who muttered that a wallet
has a way of looking like nothing more than a wallet when held by a
white man but somehow morphs into a gun in the hands of a black
man.
</P>
<P>
   And the judge's observation notwithstanding, the book is not at
all closed, even in the courts.
</P>
<P>
   The Diallo family will surely pursue civil charges. President
Clinton's Justice Department is thinking about whether to
intervene, a decision that may well become entangled in the Senate
race between Giuliani and Hillary Rodham Clinton. If nothing else,
the officers' jobs are on the line.
</P>
<P>
   The Bronx district attorney, Robert T. Johnson, can count on
being subjected to his share of post-mortems, starting with his
decision to charge the four officers with second-degree murder, a
charge that even many of the New York Police Department's most
severe critics thought from the start was unsustainable.
</P>
<P>
   Nor is the Police Department off the hook.
</P>
<P>
   For many New Yorkers, the central question was not the actions
of these four officers. It was whether the hard-nosed and largely
successful anti-crime strategies championed by Giuliani, which
included the stopping and frisking of thousands upon thousands of
black men on the street, had imbued officers with such a sense of
entitlement and aggression that something like the Diallo killing
was a disaster waiting to happen.
</P>
<P>
   It did.

example, the driver of a car pulled over for speeding. But Louden
acknowledged that people are not trained in how to be stopped by
the police.
</P>
<P>
   ``We teach police what we want them to do and in a way we expect
citizens to do what the police tell them,'' Louden said.
``Sometimes it is implied in the law and often it is explicit in
the law. Unfortunately, it doesn't always work that way.''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Gov. George W. Bush's advisers now say it was the
single most ill-considered decision of his presidential campaign.
Struggling for political redemption after his defeat in the New
Hampshire primary, Bush raced to Bob Jones University in
Greenville, S.C., the next morning.
</P>
<P>
   At first glance, the pilgrimage seemed logical. Bob Jones is an
evangelical institution that has long been a must stop on the
court-the-conservatives circuit. Ronald Reagan, Bob Dole, Dan
Quayle, Alan Keyes and Pat Buchanan all stumped there.
</P>
<P>
   Warren Tompkins, a seasoned strategist who ran Bush's operation
in South Carolina, said the visit was not impulsive; it had been
planned for nearly a week. ``We've always done it,'' Tompkins said
in an interview in which he took the credit _ or blame _ for the
decision. ``To ignore that block of voters would be like running on
a Democratic ticket and ignoring African-Americans or labor
unions.''
</P>
<P>
   But more than three weeks later, Bush is still scrambling to
tamp down a furor among Republicans, Democrats, Catholics, blacks,
Jews and the dreaded pundits _ even from many of his own supporters
_ over why he dared kick off his South Carolina campaign at a
university that prohibits interracial dating and promotes
anti-Catholic teachings.
</P>
<P>
   Even Pat Robertson, the founder of the Christian Coalition, who
has had his own share of stumbles, had no sympathy. ``I'd have
advised him not to go,'' he said. ``Bob Jones has been known as a
rather extreme place. Those people are really far out.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's aides concede that this is not another mere bump on
Bush's path to the Republican presidential nomination. By the
weekend, they were huddling in Austin to come up with a way for the
governor to publicly admit the visit was a mistake _ without
stirring up more bad publicity.
</P>
<P>
   The commotion is the latest instance this year in which the
Republican candidates have found themselves stranded in the thicket
of religion in politics _ and have not quite figured out how to get
out. First, Bush and other candidates were pilloried for expressing
their reverence for Jesus Christ; critics found their comments
off-putting and divisive. Now Catholics are being pitted against
the Christian right as Bush and his rival, Sen. John McCain, make
aggressive plays to both constituencies.
</P>
<P>
   But more than anything else, the Bob Jones debacle is a telling
case study of the importance of symbolic politics. Candidates who
are not sufficiently sensitive to symbols can cause themselves
irreparable damage in one fleeting utterance or, in the case of
Bush, one 45-minute appearance.
</P>
<P>
   A few days earlier, Bush committed another symbolic blunder when
he popped up at a rally in New Hampshire flanked by his parents. It
fueled an image that he would be nowhere without his kin.
</P>
<P>
   The Bob Jones visit took on an outsized importance because Bush
has still been a relative blank slate ideologically. Since many
voters do not have a fixed image of him, the appearance allowed his
more moderate foes to depict him as dangerously conservative. When
Dole visited the university, he had a more centrist history, so
people who objected to the school's policies were willing to give
him a pass, saying that his trip was something he had to do.
</P>
<P>
   But Bush's foray to Bob Jones, where he addressed 5,000 students
on a red-carpeted stage and delivered a speech trumpeting his
conservative credentials, has _ at least for now _ undermined his
months-long appeal to moderates who rallied to his ``compassionate
conservative'' message. Now, in the shorthand of a snippet of
videotape, Bush can be depicted by his rivals as a negative,
intolerant, hard-edged conservative.
</P>
<P>
   ``The contrast was what was so jarring to people,'' said Michael
K. Deaver, who was Reagan's image consultant. ``George W. had gone
out of his way to tell us he was a new kind of Republican.''
</P>
<P>
   The episode has left Bush struggling to put forth a positive
message about his agenda because McCain has refused to stop talking
about the visit. In fact, the matter may not have become an issue
had McCain not been in the picture _ and had his campaign not paid
for automated calls to voters in Michigan (where the population is
more than one-quarter Catholic) that lash Bush for failing to
denounce Bob Jones' ``anti-Catholic bigotry.'' Bob Jones Jr., the
son of the school's namesake, once called the Catholic Church a
``Satanic cult''.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's trip has been especially helpful to McCain, because the
senator is hardly considered a progressive. He, like Bush, had
refused to weigh in on whether a confederate flag should fly over
the state Capitol. But the visit gave Bush's detractors an opening
to accuse him of something that McCain was insulated against.
McCain's aides insist that they never got an invitation for the
senator to speak at the university.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the candidate himself, the visit did not play well
because many Republicans have moved toward the center and have
grown impatient with religious conservatives. Bush's appearance has
bothered Republicans who are still haunted by Pat Buchanan's
vitriol at the 1992 Republican convention in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush campaign may simply not have adjusted to the reality
that candidates cannot make a pitch to one narrow group, or region,
these days without drawing national attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``Growing up in the South in the civil rights era, I know plenty
of politicians who would go to one side of town and say one thing
and the other side of town and say something else,'' said Bill
Carrick, a Democratic strategist. ``You can't say things in South
Carolina that voters in Michigan aren't going to hear. It just
doesn't happen in modern politics any- more.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, politicians get away with potentially risky
alliances. When Reagan took his 1980 presidential campaign to the
Neshoba County Fair in Philadelphia, Miss., near the dirt road
where civil rights workers were killed in the 1960s, he made no
mention of the racial murder there. There was no subsequent outcry.
</P>
<P>
   No one has yet harpooned Bill Bradley for meeting recently with
the often divisive Rev. Al Sharpton. Vice President Al Gore also
met with Sharpton, but took pains to do it behind closed doors.
(Perhaps he learned his lesson from his much-ridiculed appearance
at a fund-raising event at a Buddhist temple.)
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, symbols often work to a candidate's advantage. For
example, Bill Clinton stunned the Rev. Jesse Jackson in 1992 by
appearing before his organization and assailing the race-baiting
rap singer Sister Souljah _ a move that cemented his willingness to
challenge core Democratic groups.
</P>
<P>
   Tompkins said he pressed for the Bob Jones visit because he
thought it would help assure a high turnout from religious
conservatives. He was probably right: Bush won the primary by 11
points, buoyed by a huge showing from voters who consider
themselves religious conservatives.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BC-BUSH-BOBJONES-2NDTAKE-NYT &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; WASHINGTON: religious conservatives. &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The journey took on even more significance because it was Bush's
first stop after New Hampshire. ``That was pure accident; it was
not done by design,'' Tompkins said, explaining that it was the
only time slot that worked for the governor and school officials.
</P>
<P>
   The content of Bush's speech at the university is of no
consequence (though the after-the-fact kibitzers say he could have
diffused the whole thing by telling the audience that he took issue
with some of the school's policies). Bush waited until a news
conference after the speech to say he disagreed with the school's
racial policy and rejected any anti-Catholic sentiment.
</P>
<P>
   On a fundamental level, the visit may simply point to poor staff
work in the Bush campaign. Tompkins said he sent the campaign's top
officials a ``very detailed briefing paper on questions that came
up'' at Bob Jones in the past, notably on interracial dating and
Catholic matters. (The university began admitting black students
after losing its tax-exempt status in the 1970s for refusing to do
so.)
</P>
<P>
   Asked if there were any discussions with those officials about
the possible perils of the visit, Tompkins said none that he was
involved in. Tompkins acknowledges that the campaign needs to
address the matter quickly, particularly as the campaign turns to
states where the Catholic vote is crucial. ``They're going to have
to deal with the anti-Catholic stuff straight up,'' he said. ``I'd
argue to be very aggressive.''
</P>
<P>
   William Bennett, who advises both Bush and McCain, said the
problem was not Bush's initial appearance, but his subsequent
failure to more aggressively denounce Bob Jones' policies. ``It
seemed somewhat half-hearted,'' he said. ``Governor Bush needs to
be very firm here, and very direct. That opportunity was lost.''
</P>
<P>
   For all the second-guessing, Bush's fateful appearance may have
occurred because his aides in Austin did not abide by the first
rule of presidential politics: Don't trust what your local advisers
tell you. They don't want you to lose in their state. After that,
you're on your own.

<P>
   MOSCOW _ Oh, what a lovely war. Or so the Kremlin would like its
citizens to believe.
</P>
<P>
   From the outside, seven months of Chechen conflict seems a
bloodbath to rival any of the ethnic knifings that have scarred the
planet since the Cold War ended and nationalism slipped its leash.
Chechnya is a wasteland; its capital Grozny, once home to 400,000,
obliterated. Tales of atrocities are rife. Three hundred thousand
refugees have fled. By the reckoning of experts, 10,000 people may
have perished _ and the fight isn't over.
</P>
<P>
   Inside Russia, though, almost no one sees it that way. As the
Kremlin presents it _ and so far, Russians buy it _ Chechnya
remains what it was at its start last August: a noble crusade
against terrorists and bandits, waged by an army intent on
liberating innocents, not executing or raping them. And it is a
crusade on the verge of victory, to boot.
</P>
<P>
   The parallel is obvious between the view Russians have of
Chechnya and the one most Westerners adopted toward last year's
NATO war against Yugoslavia. Which is no accident: Chechnya is the
first Russian war in history in which leaders have had to factor
public support into their military equations. In many ways, Kosovo
is the template with which they began.
</P>
<P>
   But it is not where they wound up. The modern Western view of
war, forged in Vietnam and honed to a fare-thee-well in the Persian
Gulf and Kosovo, is that no conflict can long survive the absence
of public support _ and that public support moves in inverse
proportion to the number of troops lost.
</P>
<P>
   Public opinion, monitored almost bomb-by-bomb, kept an
indisputably tight rein last year on NATO's military strategy.
</P>
<P>
   Russia has turned the lesson of the Persian Gulf and Kosovo
inside out: With public support, a war can thrive. And so in
Russia's first real democratic war, the Kremlin has shaped national
opinion with a campaign redolent of the old Soviet Union's most
xenophobic propaganda. And the military, liberated rather than
restrained by popular feeling, has pursued victory with
disturbingly vicious abandon.
</P>
<P>
   So far, at least, success has begotten success. ``In the
beginning, there was an attempt to depict it as a no-casualty war,
like Kosovo,'' Pavel Felgengauer, a military analyst and former
journalist, said last week. ``You could notice that now this theme
has virtually disappeared from Russian propaganda. Now the theme
is, `We've won, and the enemy is defeated, and everything's
fine.'''
</P>
<P>
   It is another indicator, as if another were needed, that Russia
views Western concepts like democratic rule and consent of the
governed through the opposite end of the telescope. And it is
another spadeful of dirt on the notion, naive in retrospect, that
either smart bombs or representative government would transform war
into something more humane.
</P>
<P>
   None of this is to say, of course, that either Russians or their
government are inured to body counts or television footage of
coffins coming home. The Soviet Union quit its long war in
Afghanistan 12 years ago in no small part because the sheer number
of combat deaths had elevated the conflict to an unavoidable
political issue, even before the advent of democracy. Russia's
botched effort to subdue Chechnya four years ago, and the
casualties that stemmed from it, were pillars of the public's
overwhelming support for impeaching President Boris Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
   In the latest Chechen war, military leaders have sought to
emulate NATO's own careful strategy of relentless bombing from afar
_ a strategy that allowed the West to win the war without a ground
offensive or even a single combat death among its own forces.
</P>
<P>
   Most independent observers believe _ and according to polls, so
does the Russian public _ that the government has lowballed its
tally of combat deaths. Officially the toll is more than 1,500, but
it is widely suspected to be twice that.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the option of keeping war politically palatable by
limiting the body count has never been a serious one here.
Chechnya's Islamic guerrillas could not be bombed out of existence
without leveling the entire region _ something the Russian military
has come perilously close to achieving. Even so, the Russians have
not been able to avoid a ground war, house-to-house firefights and
heavy casualties.
</P>
<P>
   This is one of the big differences between Kosovo and Chechnya.
The West relied on an arsenal of smart bombs to limit civilian
deaths and high-tech aircraft and equipment to keep its troops out
of harm's way.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's military has neither, and its troops, a mix of
conscripts, soldiers of fortune and career officers, is woefully
short of discipline. The result has been a civilian death toll and
a record of apparent atrocities that is internationally mortifying
_ and that would trigger a political revolt in most societies.
</P>
<P>
   In Russia, it has not. Indeed, after six months of war, 7 in 10
Russians favor continuing the Chechen war to the bitter end,
according to a survey by the Public Opinion Foundation, a respected
Moscow polling organization.
</P>
<P>
   In part, that is surely because Russians truly see Chechnya's
rebels, with a long list of kidnappings and grisly executions to
their credit, as entirely deserving of extermination. In part, it
is because terrorist bombings that killed more than 300 people last
year galvanized the country behind the extermination of the Islamic
radicals who are blamed for _ if not yet charged with _ the
killings. In part, it is simple racism: dark-skinned Caucasians
remain doormats in a nation that has a long way to go to achieve
any measure of tolerance.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BC-RUSSIA-CHECHNYA-REVIEW-2NDTAKE-NYT &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; MOSCOW: of tolerance. &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But as much as anything, perhaps, it is because of the way this
war has been cast by its Kremlin authors: as a test of Russian
manhood, if not of the nation's very existence. Senior Russian
officials and their political allies more and more equate criticism
of the Chechen war with treason. Western complaints about human
rights issues are branded as anti-Russian agitprop.
</P>
<P>
   Last week a German video tape was released showing Russian
troops doing a mass burial of bound Chechen soldiers. Such things
are dismissed not just as lies, but as malicious interference in
Russia's affairs.
</P>
<P>
   All this harkens to Kosovo, a war that is still seen in the
Kremlin and among ordinary Russians as poaching on Russian turf. No
doubt the theme of Russia reasserting its sphere of influence is an
effective way to marshal Russian support for the Chechen war _ and,
maybe, to score electoral points in the process. The xenophobic
image of Fortress Russia, beleaguered and under assault by enemies
near and far, is a popular theme in Russian history.
</P>
<P>
   But it is also a theme at loggerheads with the Kremlin's stated
intention of hauling Russia out of its Soviet-era trance and
propelling it into the international community. That goal would be
especially poorly served if the price for sustaining the war's
popularity turns out to be a return to Soviet-style manipulation of
opinionand truth, however much Fortress Russia is reinvigorated.

<P>
   MOSCOW _ Oh, what a lovely war. Or so the Kremlin would like its
citizens to believe.
</P>
<P>
   From the outside, seven months of Chechen conflict seems a
bloodbath to rival any of the ethnic knifings that have scarred the
planet since the Cold War ended and nationalism slipped its leash.
Chechnya is a wasteland; its capital Grozny, once home to 400,000,
obliterated. Tales of atrocities are rife. Three hundred thousand
refugees have fled. By the reckoning of experts, 10,000 people may
have perished _ and the fight isn't over.
</P>
<P>
   Inside Russia, though, almost no one sees it that way. As the
Kremlin presents it _ and so far, Russians buy it _ Chechnya
remains what it was at its start last August: a noble crusade
against terrorists and bandits, waged by an army intent on
liberating innocents, not executing or raping them. And it is a
crusade on the verge of victory, to boot.
</P>
<P>
   The parallel is obvious between the view Russians have of
Chechnya and the one most Westerners adopted toward last year's
NATO war against Yugoslavia. Which is no accident: Chechnya is the
first Russian war in history in which leaders have had to factor
public support into their military equations. In many ways, Kosovo
is the template with which they began.
</P>
<P>
   But it is not where they wound up. The modern Western view of
war, forged in Vietnam and honed to a fare-thee-well in the Persian
Gulf and Kosovo, is that no conflict can long survive the absence
of public support _ and that public support moves in inverse
proportion to the number of troops lost.
</P>
<P>
   Public opinion, monitored almost bomb-by-bomb, kept an
indisputably tight rein last year on NATO's military strategy.
</P>
<P>
   Russia has turned the lesson of the Persian Gulf and Kosovo
inside out: With public support, a war can thrive. And so in
Russia's first real democratic war, the Kremlin has shaped national
opinion with a campaign redolent of the old Soviet Union's most
xenophobic propaganda. And the military, liberated rather than
restrained by popular feeling, has pursued victory with
disturbingly vicious abandon.
</P>

   Editors: The following items from The N.Y. Times Week in Review
for Sunday, Feb. 27, moved Saturday and are repeated Monday.
</P>
<P>
   On the dress page:
</P>
<P>
   BUSH-BOBJONES-REVIEW (Washington) _ Gov. George W. Bush's
advisers say his speech at Bob Jones University was the single most
ill-considered decision of his presidential campaign. It was
clearly not just another mere bump on Bush's path to the GOP
nomination. By this weekend, Bush's aides were huddling to come up
with a way for him to publicly admit the visit was a mistake _
without stirring up more bad publicity. By Richard L. Berke. (Moved
in `a' category)
</P>
<P>
   RUSSIA-CHECHNYA-REVIEW (Moscow) _ From the outside, seven months
of Chechen conflict seems a bloodbath to rival anything since World
War II. Chechnya is a wsteland; its capital, Grozny, obliterated.
Tales of atrocities are rife, and 300,000 refugees have fled. But
inside Russia, almost no one sees it that way. The Kremlin's
official line, which so far has been accepted by the Russian
public, is that Chechnya was a noble crusade against terrorists and
bandits, waged by an army intent on liberating innocents, not
executing or raping them. By Michael Wines. (Moved in `i' category)
</P>
<P>
   _ Also moved in the `a' category:
</P>
<P>
   DIALLO-IMPACT-REVIEW (New York) _ After an Albany jury acquitted
four New York City police officers in the killing of Amadou Diallo,
the judge declared the book closed. That is true as far as the
courtroom goes. But it may take a while before the book closes, if
it ever does, on the troubled collective conscience of New York and
perhaps elsewhere in America. It was hard for many New Yorkers to
shake the sense that this had all come out wrong. Even if heads
said the jury had done its job, hearts ached. By Clyde Haberman.
</P>
<P>
   DIALLO-POLICE-REVIEW (New York) _ Although the officers who
killed Amadou Diallo were found innocent of all charges, their
trial testimony was instructive in how police expect you to behave
when they confront you. Speak when asked to speak. Stop when
ordered to stop. Keep your hands in plain view. And never _ EVER _
make a sudden move. By Dan Barry.
</P>
<P>
   DIALLO-SONGS-REVIEW (Undated) _ An innocent man slain by police
is remembered in songs. Some excerpted lyrics.
</P>
<P>
   SCIENCE-JOURNALISM-REVIEW (Undated) _ Even the high drama of
disaster, violence and political upheaval that dominates the news
can lose its luster for many journalists who entered their
profession mainly to seek new experiences. After a time, a news
writer may begin to sense a kind of sameness in most of the events
that pass as news. But a lucky few discover that in science, almost
alone of all human endeavors, there is always something new under
the sun. By Malcolm W. Browne.
</P>
<P>
   PAIN-TREATMENT-REVIEW (Undated) _ A look at trends in relieving
pain in cancer patients and others in severe discomfort.
Comprehending the magnitude of pain that accompanies some medical
conditions is very difficult for those who have not themselves
suffered. Among the several difficulties inherent in the
misapprehensions about the treatment of pain is the troublesome
fact that there has never been any accurate way to measure its
severity. But this may be changing. By Sherwin B. Nuland.
</P>
<P>
   REFORM-PARTY-REVIEW (Washington) _ For all the money and fury
involved in the primary campaigns of the two major parties, there
is another contest going on under the radar, among the
mud-spattered troops of the Reform Party slogging through their own
wilderness campaign. Eventually, the Democratic and Republican
victors will have to pay attention. For, barring intrusion by Ross
Perot, the expectation among political professionals is that the
Reform line could be resurrected this fall by Patrick Buchanan. By
Francis X. Clines.
</P>
<P>
   INTERNET-MONEYLAUNDER-REVIEW (Undated) _ It's no longer hard to
become the financial mogul _ replete with an aristocratic title
conveying pomp and privilege _ that you've always dreamed of
becoming. Just visit the Internet. There are throngs of outfits on
the Web that cater to these desires. For example, just type in
``offshoresecrets.com'' and enter a world promising ``fast, safe,
private, and affordable off-shore services.'' Those services
include providing customers with banking charters in such obscure
locales as Nevis and Vanuatu for a fee of about $20,000. By Timothy
L. O'Brien.
</P>
<P>
   GRAMMYS-REVIEW (Undated) _ The Grammy Awards can be seen as a
sort of musical Land That Time Forgot, a place where the best
surprise is no surprise. This is where the music business tries to
place its imprimatur on the ungovernable energies of American pop
culture. ``Old people _ the Grammy voters _ like to be reminded
that the young people aren't taking over, which is ironic when
you're talking about pop music,'' notes popular culture critic
Robert Wilonsky. For instance, the organization once awarded Petula
Clark a Grammy over the Beatles. By Elvis Mitchell.
</P>
<P>
   THISWEEK-REVIEW (Undated) _ Some highlights of the week.
</P>
<P>
   _ Also moved in the `i' category:
</P>
<P>
   CHINA-TAIWAN-REVIEW (Beijing) _ Who lost Taiwan? Even the
possibility that this question may some day be asked must be
horrifying for China's leaders. For in China's history-laden
politics, almost nothing matters more than the idea of Taiwan's
eventual return to the motherland, especially now that Hong Kong
and Macau are back. And this emotional truth may aid the
interpretation of the White Paper they issued last week, warning
more explicitly than before that Taiwan's foot-dragging in
negotiations, let alone a declaration of independence, could force
China into ``drastic measures.'' By Erik Eckholm.
</P>
<P>
   IRAN-REFORM-REVIEW (Tehran, Iran) _ United by little more than
antagonism toward the insular clerics who have tried desperately to
maintain their monopoly on ideas, the self-styled reformers have
now gained the upper hand following their victory in the first
round of parliamentary elections Feb. 18. The reform movement is
partly a backlash against a conservative clerical cartel that fears
change and has tried to stifle it with arrests and violence. It is
also a natural by-product of the theocratic regime that has ruled
Iran since the 1979 Islamic revolution. By Susan Sachs.

Iran since the 1979 Islamic revolution. By Susan Sachs.

CHINESE SAILED TO MEXICO MILLENNIA AGO, TCU SCHOLAR SAYS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By PETE ALFANO 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Mike Xu (pronounced Shu) walks briskly into
the faculty lounge at Texas Christian University and quickly
canvasses the room. It's midafternoon and the lounge is nearly
empty, which appears to be to his liking. He places several
magazine articles on a table _ the one on top is in Chinese _ and
begins the conversation with a disclaimer.
</P>
<P>
   This is not about self-promotion, says Xu, a professor of
Chinese Studies at TCU; this is not a personal crusade. This is
about presenting evidence and letting people reach their own
conclusions.
</P>
<P>
   Xu, who was born in Shanghai and came to the United States 14
years ago, advocates a theory that Asians _ notably the Chinese _
sailed the Pacific Ocean to the New World 3,000 years ago, landing
in what is now southern Mexico, near the border of Guatemala. The
boat crossings would have occurred in 1100 B.C., centuries before
the Vikings or Columbus made it to our shores.
</P>
<P>
   If substantiated, this would mean that the Mesoamerican period
in the history of the New World was directly influenced by the
Chinese. Some might go a step further and argue that it shows the
Chinese were actually the first to discover the Americas, though Xu
says even Chinese scholars won't go that far.
</P>
<P>
   His evidence supporting trans-Pacific contact by the Chinese is
the inscriptions found on jade artifacts during excavations in
Central America in the region where the Olmec established what is
considered to be Mexico's first society. The Olmec writing symbols
are nearly identical to those used in the writing system of the
Shang Dynasty, which ruled northern China during 1100 B.C.
</P>
<P>
   Xu thumbed through several pages of a Chinese journal that
published his examples of the Olmec and Shang writing systems.
Pointing enthusiastically to various symbols, he says the
similarities are too strong to be a coincidence. His theory has
widespread support among ``diffusionists,'' those who believe that
society in the Americas was influenced by different civilizations
thousands of years before the time of Columbus.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's absolute evidence of contact,'' says Betty Meggers, a
research archaeologist at the Smithsonian in Washington. ``No one
can suggest that the same writing system was invented twice.''
</P>
<P>
   Although universities are usually considered bastions of free
speech and new ideas, it isn't every day that a member of the
faculty suggests that history may have to be rewritten. Think of
all the lesson plans that would have to be revised, the history
books that would have to be amended.
</P>
<P>
   By endorsing what mainstream scholars say is an unsubstantiated
theory about how civilization evolved in Central America, Xu is
attracting attention that's making him somewhat uncomfortable.
</P>
<P>
   ``People make you part of the lunatic fringe,'' he says. ``I
have really not been actively involved in the debate. But I believe
the academic discipline is to be flexible.''
</P>
<P>
   Mainstream scholars, or ``nativists,'' as they are sometimes
called, attempt to debunk the theory of direct Chinese influence
during the Mesoamerican period, claiming the Olmec were indigenous.
They also dismiss claims that visitors from Africa and Europe
visited the New World before Columbus made his voyage and that
those visitors had an influence on how society evolved here.
</P>
<P>
   Nativists believe that the first inhabitants of the Americas
crossed the land bridge that formed over the Bering Strait (between
Siberia and Alaska) after the Ice Age, 12,000 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Their descendants migrated southward over the centuries,
eventually settling in North, Central and South America. American
Indians, for example, are considered descendants of these
aboriginals.
</P>
<P>
   Although scholars acknowledge that the Vikings may have preceded
Columbus, they say there is no suggestion that they had an
influence on civilization in the Americas.
</P>
<P>
   ``The point is that these theories imply that a superior culture
group thus brought civilization to them,'' says David Grove, an
archaeologist at the University of Illinois. ``They are actually
stealing the rich heritage of Mexico's great civilizations from all
people of Mexican descent.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, artifacts unearthed in various excavations over the years
appear to indicate some direct contact. New Scientist, a weekly
magazine based in London, recently reported that Roman Hristov, an
anthropologist formerly associated with Southern Methodist
University in Dallas, tested a black terra-cotta head that was
first unearthed in 1933 in the Toluca Valley near Mexico City. The
Roman head, which is just a few centimeters tall, represents a
bearded man, which researchers and art experts say dates to A.D.
200.
</P>
<P>
   MORE nn
</P>
<P>
   Grove says the head could have been taken from a Roman shipwreck
off the coast of Mexico centuries later. Acknowledging that he may
be accused of ``academic snobbery,'' Grove says he always tells his
students that ``belief does not constitute proof.'' He says Xu's
evidence of Chinese contact in Central America is limited and that
the writing systems of the Olmec and Shang have only vague
similarities.
</P>
<P>
   He also cites a lack of similarity in other examples of Olmec
and Shang culture, for instance, pottery and the lack of Shang
metallurgy. Grove says that the prevalence of crocodiles in Olmec
art, which diffusionists say mirrors the Shang Dynasty's depiction
of dragons, simply reflects a formidable creature that inhabits the
tropical rivers where the Olmec lived.
</P>
<P>
   Pragmatists add that surviving a trans-Pacific crossing in
primitive craft 3,000 years ago would have been out of the
question.
</P>
<P>
   ``He (Xu) is on a mission to spread his ideas,'' Grove says.
``He has no background in Mexican archaeology or scientific method.
If there were one shred of evidence, then great bunches of
archaeologists would jump on that and build their fame. It's (a
theory) reborn every decade or so. Now, it's Mike Xu's turn to
reinvent the wheel.''
</P>
<P>
   Xu says he is not interested in getting in the middle of a
debate between diffusionists and nativists. He understands that
because he is not an archaeologist or anthropologist, his opinions
carry less weight. His interpretation of the Olmec and Shang
writing systems was even rejected at first in China. In effect, he
is seen as digging in someone else's dirt.
</P>
<P>
   But what endears Xu to diffusionists is that his Chinese
heritage gives him credibility; he is more qualified to interpret
the writing systems of the Shang and Olmec. The inscriptions he
found on Olmec artifacts were not random, he says. They include
consecutive symbols that convey complete thoughts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him, `You're just the kind of person needed to get at
this,''' Meggers says. ``The progress he's made is amazing,
especially in reading the script.''
</P>
<P>
   Grove says that if you believe in ancient contact, you might as
well credit space aliens with influencing civilization in
Mesoamerica as well.
</P>
<P>
   But why all the fuss? The Americas today are a melting pot of
cultures from around the world. What would be so wrong with
suggesting it may have been so thousands of years ago, too?
</P>
<P>
   Meggers says that nativists want to believe that culture in the
New World evolved independently to show that, in effect, mankind
could reinvent itself. That is more comforting than accepting the
theory of cultural integration during human history.
</P>
<P>
   Although the burden of proof may be on diffusionists, mainstream
scholars may find it difficult to continue explaining away findings
of ancient contact unearthed in excavations throughout the
Americas, Meggers says.
</P>
<P>
   She points to excavations in South America that have uncovered
sites at least 12,000 years old. No one who crossed the land
bridge, she says, could have migrated that far south that quickly.
</P>
<P>
   She also has found similarities between pottery made in Japan
and that found at a site in Ecuador dating back almost 5,000 years.
Some researchers say that aboriginal Australians may have sailed to
South America 15,000 years ago, predating even the land-bridge
crossing.
</P>
<P>
   Xu, however, is limiting the debate to the Olmec/Shang
comparisons.
</P>
<P>
   ``They say it is possible for people to migrate here 12,000
years ago, but not 3,000?'' he asks. ``I went to museums in Mexico
and archaeological sites; I saw motifs (figures) identical to ones
in China. There are 200, 300 writings _ quantity and quality.''
</P>
<P>
   He says that in 1996 he finally convinced the most prominent
scholar in China of trans-Pacific contact; subsequently, Xu has had
a 16-page article on the Olmec/Shang comparisons published in
China's most prestigious publication, the Shanghai Journal of
Social Sciences.
</P>
<P>
   He is excited but cautious. He knows the debate is not new and
may continue indefinitely.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to say the mystery is solved,'' Xu said. ``We
don't have to agree, but we cannot assume we know everything. I
just want the evidence to speak for itself.''

MURDOCH JOINS TAKEOVER BID FOR HONG KONG PHONE COMPANY 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By MARK LANDLER with ANDREW ROSS SORKIN    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   HONG KONG _ Rupert Murdoch's foray into the takeover battle for
Hong Kong's local phone company, Cable &AMP; Wireless HKT, scrambles
what had been for many people here a contest between a home-town
hero and a foreign interloper.
</P>
<P>
   Murdoch's News Corp. confirmed Monday that it would invest $1
billion and create an Asian joint venture with Singapore
Telecommunications, which is negotiating with Cable &AMP; Wireless PLC
of Britain to acquire control of its Hong Kong subsidiary.
Executives close to Singapore Telecommunications said it had
sweetened the cash portion of its offer for Cable &AMP; Wireless HKT by
$1 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The revised offer could enable the Singapore company to regain
the momentum in its battle with Pacific Century Cyberworks, which
on Sunday offered to acquire Cable &AMP; Wireless HKT in a
stock-and-cash bid that values the company at $35 billion.
Singapore Telecom's first bid had been slightly lower than Pacific
Century's, executives involved in the negotiations said, but the
bids were now comparable.
</P>
<P>
   Pacific Century Cyberworks was founded nine months ago by
Richard Li, the 33-year-old son of the powerful Hong Kong tycoon,
Li Ka-shing. The younger Li's stock has enjoyed one of the most
spectacular rides in the history of the Hong Kong stock exchange.
Although he is using those volatile shares to support his bid, he
has created an aura of inevitability about his campaign for Cable &AMP;
Wireless HKT.
</P>
<P>
   But with Singapore Telecommunications adding $1 billion in cash
to its offer, the directors of Cable &AMP; Wireless may cast a colder
eye on Li's proposal, which is more than two-thirds financed by
stock. Moreover, analysts said the benefits of the investment
extended beyond cash.
</P>
<P>
   ``The attractiveness of the deal to SingTel is a lot more than
that,'' said Dylan Tinker, a telecommunications analyst at Deutsche
Securities here. ``News Corp. gives them content for an Asia-based
satellite satellite programming service, which is what they want to
create.''
</P>
<P>
   As part of the agreement between News Corp. and Singapore
Telecommunications, the companies will create an Internet,
television and mobile-phone joint venture. Among the venture's most
ambitious goals is to create an Internet-access service for
cellular phone subscribers.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``Singapore Telecom is clearly the right partner for us in
fulfilling our goal of building the premiere digital delivery
platform in Asia,'' Murdoch said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Last November, News Corp. set up a joint venture with Cable &AMP;
Wireless HKT to offer pay-television and Internet-related services
through high-capacity lines. This joint venture would be similar,
though with a mobile-phone dimension. If Singapore Telecom acquires
HKT, the ventures could be combined _ creating an Internet-access
service that reaches nearly a million cellular subscribers in Hong
Kong and Singapore.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said News Corp.'s programming venture with Cable &AMP;
Wireless HKT is one of the company's main drawing points for
Pacific Century. Li is planning a satellite-delivered Internet
service of his own, to be called Network of the World. But his
company lacks programming.
</P>
<P>
   Executives close to Singapore Telecommunications said, however,
that Murdoch would probably unravel the venture if Pacific Century
acquired Cable &AMP; Wireless HKT. In 1995, Li sold News Corp. the Star
TV satellite network for $950 million. His plans for a new
satellite network are seen as a competitive threat to Star TV,
which is finally turning a profit after years of losing money.
</P>
<P>
   After confirming Monday morning that it made a formal offer for
Cable &AMP; Wireless HKT, Pacific Century left the Hong Kong market in
a state of confusion. The company initially said it would hold a
news briefing to discuss its bid, only to cancel it in the
afternoon. Pacific Century's shares were suspended for a second
consecutive session, which had the effect of locking in the value
of its stock-and-cash offer. Some market experts said the halt in
the stock _ combined with the lack of details about the bid _
raised troubling questions of disclosure.
</P>
<P>
   ``They should have let it trade today,'' said Marc Faber, the
head of an investment firm here. ``My feeling is that the shares
would have been substantially lower than they were last week.''
</P>
<P>
   Having said that, Faber said he thought Li was wise to use his
stock to bid for a company with genuine assets. Aside from a
portfolio of investments in Internet start-ups, Pacific Century
Cyberworks is a company that exists largely in blueprints. It has
no customers and no operating profits.
</P>
<P>
   ``The heyday of Hong Kong Telecom is over,'' Faber said. ``But
when you've got free money like Richard Li does, any purchase is
better than none.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the outcome of the bidding war, News Corp.'s investment
is fresh evidence of the role that young entrepreneurs are taking
in major deals in the Internet era.
</P>
<P>
   The point man in this deal was James Murdoch, 27, the second son
of Rupert Murdoch. The younger Murdoch was named head of News
Corp.'s worldwide Internet holdings last November. He traveled to
Hong Kong to hammer out the details of the joint venture with Lee
Hsien Yang, 42, the chief executive of Singapore Telecom.
</P>
<P>
   Lee is the second son of Lee Kwan Yew, the founder of modern
Singapore. The elder Lee's status there is probably even more
exalted than that of Richard Li's father in Hong Kong or Murdoch's
father in Australia. But together, the three young men are a
striking example of how young people can play a pivotal role in
Internet-age deal-making _ provided they have the right parents.

&HT;     POLL SHOWS SUPPORT FOR BAN ON GAY MARRIAGES IN CALIFORNIA 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By CAROL NESS  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ A new poll shows that Californians remain
solidly supportive of a ballot initiative that would bar the legal
recognition of gay marriages in the state.
</P>
<P>
   Of 650 likely voters surveyed last week, 55 percent favor
Proposition 22, 38 percent oppose it and 7 percent are undecided.
The election is March 7.
</P>
<P>
   The results the poll, conducted for the San Francisco Examiner
and KTVU-TV, are consistent with every poll published since
October. All have shown that the measure is supported by slightly
more than half the state's voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``What will be interesting is what both sides do from now till
then,'' said pollster Del Ali of Research 2000 in Rockville, Md.
``I've seen initiatives with 50 percent lose in the last week. It's
rare, but it does happen.''
</P>
<P>
   The latest statewide survey is the first since the campaign
against Proposition 22, also known as the Knight Initiative,
launched its television advertising campaign in the Bay Area and
three other populous regions. The results suggest the ads have
swayed few minds so far since the ads began appearing four weeks
earlier.
</P>
<P>
   The initiative is sponsored by state Sen. William ``Pete''
Knight, a Republican from Palmdale who has tried unsuccessfully to
get the state Legislature to pass laws against same-sex marriages.
</P>
<P>
   While gay marriage is not legal in California or any other
state, Proposition 22 would define marriage here as ``between a man
and a woman only.'' And it would prohibit California from
recognizing gay marriages performed in other states, should they
ever become legal there.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty other states have adopted similar laws since Hawaii came
close to legalizing gay marriage in the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   According to the new poll results, Proposition 22 is favored by
every demographic group in the state and every region except the
San Francisco Bay Area. The margin of error is plus or minus 4
percentage points. According to the poll:
</P>
<P>
   _ Men (59 percent) support the initiative more strongly than
women (51 percent).
</P>
<P>
   _ Republicans (66 percent) back it more than Democrats (51
percent).
</P>
<P>
   Breakdowns show no differences among racial and ethnic groups,
despite Yes on 22 advertising that targeted Hispanic voters. Just
over 50 percent of all groups support Proposition 22.
</P>
<P>
   The only pocket of opposition is the Bay Area, where the
statewide numbers are reversed: 40 percent of those surveyed favor
Proposition 22 and 57 percent oppose it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The numbers have been remarkably stable,'' said Mark
Baldassare of the Public Policy Institute of California. He has
done his own polling on the ballot initiative, among other
statewide issues, and his results have shown the same consistency.
</P>
<P>
   ``Despite the money and efforts by the no side _ and by the yes
side for that matter _ we continue to see a slight majority in
favor of Prop. 22,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Baldassare said his statewide surveys show Californians
overwhelmingly favor gay rights, from domestic partnership benefits
to the ability to serve openly in the military. But voters surveyed
say they oppose gay marriage, and by the same proportion they
support Proposition 22, according to Baldassare's polls.
</P>
<P>
   ``California, if anything, is more liberal than the nation on
gay marriage, but it's not ready at this point to support gay
marriage,'' he said.

SHARIF'S LAWYERS WILL BOYCOTT PAKISTAN TRIAL 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By BARRY BEARAK    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW DELHI, India _ The hijacking trial of the deposed prime
minister of Pakistan _ already a cavalcade of the unexpected and
the bizarre _ took another odd twist over the weekend as his entire
defense team quit in protest against alleged government unfairness.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am an attorney and my job is to help my client, but that has
become impossible when the court has placed an embargo on his
rights,'' attorney Ijaz Batalvi said Monday in a telephone
interview from Lahore. ``For months, my client has been scandalized
and maligned. By what authority is he now being denied his turn to
speak?''
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Judge Rehmat Hussain Jafri accepted a prosecution
request that any testimony by the former prime minister, Nawaz
Sharif, be given in secret. It would be released to the public only
after the court determines that nothing is ``likely to tarnish and
affect the security, integrity and solidarity'' of the nation, the
judge said. Pakistan has been under military rule since Oct. 12.
</P>
<P>
   Defense lawyers immediately criticized the decision, and on
Sunday, Batalvi and his colleague Khwaja Sultan Ahmed announced
that they would boycott the trial, leaving their client's fate to
``God Almighty who is guardian of truth and savior of the
innocent.''
</P>
<P>
   The prosecution reacted angrily, saying the defense team's
objections were ``a mere pretext in light of overwhelming
evidence'' against Sharif.
</P>
<P>
   The ousted prime minister, his brother Shahbaz and five others
face charges that include hijacking, treason and attempted murder.
Hijacking is a capital offense in Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
   At present, only two of the accused _ Ghous Ali Shah, once an
adviser to Sharif, and Rana Maqbool, the former inspector general
of police in Sindh province _ are represented by lawyers. The
trial's next session is set for Wednesday. By law, the court must
appoint new defense attorneys, though the defendants can reject
them and appear as their own counsel.
</P>
<P>
   The hijacking charge stems from Oct. 12, when Sharif fired the
army chief of staff, Gen. Pervez Musharraf, and then allegedly
conspired to deny landing rights to a commercial plane that was
carrying the general to Karachi.
</P>
<P>
   As the aircraft meandered through the skies, its fuel supply
dwindling, the military coup took place. Army officers took command
of air traffic control. By the time the plane landed safely, Sharif
was in custody and Musharraf was in charge of the country.
</P>
<P>
   Under international pressure to restore democracy, Musharraf has
repeatedly promised that the trial will be held in complete
openness.
</P>
<P>
   Sharif, like all criminal defendants here, is required to read a
statement to the court. It was expected he would lambaste his
military successors and make an emotional appeal to his countrymen
and the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever Nawaz Sharif has to say is of no danger to the
nation, only to the regime that has seized its control,'' Batalvi
said.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton has yet to decide whether to add Pakistan to
his itinerary during a visit to India and Bangladesh next month, a
decision e made complicated by the coup. Last month, Musharraf
demanded that all higher court judges either resign or swear an
oath of loyalty to the military government.
</P>
<P>
   The trial is being held in a special anti-terrorism court, a
creation of Sharif himself, who wanted speedy justice for heinous
offenses. The court's expedited proceedings preclude the appeal of
a ruling like the one Jaffri made Friday on Sharif's testimony.
</P>
<P>
   The judge has been an on-again, off-again presider in the case.
During pre-trial hearings, the military decided to change some of
the nation's anti-terrorism laws, deciding that only a high court
judge could hear such important matters.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Shabir Ahmed took over, but he resigned on Jan. 12,
complaining that so many government intelligence agents were
present in the courtroom that ``I cannot provide a fair trial.''
</P>
<P>
   He returned the case to Jaffri, who again had to deal with the
consistent complaints of the defense attorneys: that they were
being denied the right to examine prosecution evidence, that they
were kept from meeting with their clients, that their hotel rooms
were bugged.
</P>
<P>
   The chief witness against Sharif is Amanullah Chaudhry, the
former director of the Civil Aviation Authority. He was originally
one of the defendants and had complained, through his attorney,
that he was under such emotional strain he was considering suicide.
Not long after, he became a prosecution witness, testifying that
Sharif personally called him three times, ordering him to divert
the plane.

&HT;     SLURS ARE WORDS THAT HURT 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By ANNIE NAKAO  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The celebrated African-American poet Counte
Cullen wrote about visiting Baltimore as a small child and smiling
at another youngster the same size.
</P>
<P>
   ``But he poked out his tongue and called me `nigger.'/ I saw the
whole of Baltimore/ From May until December;/ Of all the things
that happened there/ That's all that I remember,''
</P>
<P>
   Cullen wrote his poem, ``Incident,'' 75 years ago. But the slur
that inspired it has just as much power today.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps because of that, the ``N-word'' and other blatant ethnic
slurs are rarely heard in public discourse.
</P>
<P>
   But when they are _ as in the recent case of GOP presidential
hopeful Sen. John McCain's use of the slur ``gook'' _ the public
outcry they provoke is a reminder of their undiminished force.
</P>
<P>
   ``These symbols are powerful,' said anthropologist and
folklorist Alan Dundes of the University of California at Berkeley.
``They have tremendous emotional repercussions and associations.
They are fighting words.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain has apologized for using the slur to describe his North
Vietnamese captors. The former Navy flier was tortured during his 5
1/2 years as a prisoner of war.
</P>
<P>
   Criticized by Asian-American groups and others, McCain said he
held the people of Vietnam in the highest regard and would no
longer use the term.
</P>
<P>
   ``I deeply regret any pain I may have caused by my choice of
words,'' McCain said. ``I apologize and renounce any language that
is bigoted and offensive, which is contrary to all that I represent
and believe.''
</P>
<P>
   The McCain remarks have spurred debates around America's water
coolers, dinner tables and in cyberspace.
</P>
<P>
   Some defend him, saying he was justifiably expressing his hatred
for his captors. Others condemn him for using the slur, which does
not just apply to Vietnamese but is regarded as a generic slur
against all Asians, including Asian Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Irving Allen, a University of Connecticut sociologist, said that
while gook is ``clearly an offensive word, its power, like that of
other slurs, depends on the circumstances. In his 1990 book,
``Unkind Words, Ethnic Labeling from Redskin to WASP,'' Allen said
the devastating meaning of slurs really lies in what the words
``mean to the speaker, the hearer, their relationship and the
social context in which the words were said.''
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco's poet laureate, Janice Mirikitani _ a
third-generation Japanese American who was interned in a U.S. World
War II camp at age 1 with her family _ says that when someone uses
a term like gook, ``it again alienates us from who we are as a
rightful part of the fabric of America.''
</P>
<P>
   For San Francisco Supervisor Mabel Teng, the word brings back
memories of growing up as an immigrant in Ann Arbor, Mich., where
high school kids called her ``Chink.''
</P>
<P>
   ```Ching Chong Chinaman, never eat your vitamin,' that's what
they said to me,'' Teng recalled. ``They thought it was funny. I
did not think it was funny.''
</P>
<P>
   For John Rickford, an African American who is a Stanford
University linguist, the term gook conjured up Cullen's poem as
well as an incident two years ago in which Rickford's then
13-year-old son was called ``nigger'' in Palo Alto.
</P>
<P>
   ``People don't really know, don't have a sense of the power of
those symbols until they walk in other people's shoes,'' said
Rickford.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the power of words is such that the late Peter Opie, an
expert on children's lore, once suggested that the well-known
doggerel on name-calling should be rephrased to say: ``Sticks and
stones just break my bones. It's words that really hurt me.''
</P>
<P>
   Allen calculates that nearly 2,000 words would qualify as
epithets.
</P>
<P>
   Some are surprising in their common usage among some Americans,
such as ``to welsh'' (or renege) on a deal; to ``jew'' someone down
(to bargain ruthlessly) or to ``dutch,'' meaning to ruin with
malice. Even ``Scotch'' tape originally had a pejorative meaning by
implying a cheap way of repairing something, Allen said.
</P>
<P>
   The profusion of ethnic slurs in American English stems from the
country's history of ethnic conflict, Allen says. ``Words are
weapons, and hurling epithets is a universal trait of hostile
intergroup relations,'' he wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Offensive words have ``long, convoluted and sometimes idiotic''
histories. In America, slurs had their beginning when British
settlers started calling Native Americans ``Redskins.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, slavery brought an even ``larger torrent of verbal
abuse,'' Allen wrote. ``As other groups arrived and the country
became more ethnically diverse, the number of slurs grew in direct
proportion.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain follows a number of public figures who have made ethnic
slurs. President Richard Nixon referred to ``Jew boys.'' Former
Agriculture Secretary Earl Butts had to resign after making
insulting jokes about blacks in front of reporters. And the Rev.
Jesse Jackson used the term ``Hymie'' referring to Jews and
``Hymietown'' referring to New York City.
</P>
<P>
   Minorities also heap pejoratives on whites: ``marshmallows,''
``vanilla,'' ``white bread'' and ``soda cracker.''
</P>
<P>
   But ethnic majority groups are far more likely to make ethnic
slurs since, Allen says, ``they had the greater interest in keeping
other groups down.''
</P>
<P>
   The most visceral of slurs, experts agree, is the N-word. Yet
some blacks have appropriated that slur and used it in a jocular or
even affectionate fashion within their group, a linguistic process
known as semantic inversion.
</P>
<P>
   ``But there's still a very sharp line,'' said Rickford of
Stanford. ``It's like `queers' can call themselves `queers,' and
that's fine.''
</P>
<P>
   But the same privilege isn't open to outsiders.
</P>
<P>
   Dundes, of UC-Berkeley, would place gook in the same category as
the N-word and `kike,' referring to a Jew.
</P>
<P>
   No one knows quite what the origins of gook are, though most
believe the term arose out of the many wars American soldiers have
fought in Asia. It is particularly associated with the Vietnam War
and has since morphed into a generic slur for Asians.
</P>
<P>
   Henry Der, deputy superintendent of education for California
schools and a longtime civil rights activist, said the term gook
``reinforces stereotypic racism, animosity, hateful feelings toward
an individual who looks Asian. It's similar to people using `Jap'
or `Chink' to anyone who looks Asian.''

REFORM JEWS AND OTHER GROUPS MAKING GUN CONTROL A `RELIGIOUS
OBLIGATION'
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TARA DOOLEY 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Schools, churches and community centers _ once considered safe
havens for people _ have become the sites for recent violence close
to home and across the country.
</P>
<P>
   This year, the leaders of Reform Judaism are calling on
congregation members to aim straight for the means of that
violence: guns.
</P>
<P>
   At a meeting of the Union of American Hebrew Congregations in
December, the president of the organization of Reform Jewish
synagogues urged congregation members to ``go on the moral
offensive, and send the message to our legislators that we care
deeply about this issue and we will hold them accountable.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to see the control of guns not as a political problem,
but as a solemn religious obligation,'' UAHC President Rabbi Eric
Yoffie said at the group's 65th General Assembly in Orlando, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   The UAHC has long been in favor of gun control, said Rabbi David
Saperstein, director of the Religious Action Center of Reform
Judaism in Washington. But after the shootings at Columbine High
School near Littleton, Colo., Wedgwood Baptist Church in Fort Worth
and a Jewish community center near Los Angeles, gun control gained
top-billing at the UAHC biennial convention.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has always been an important issue,'' Saperstein said.
``What is new is that the president of our movement urged our
congregations to make this a major priority for the coming year.''
</P>
<P>
   As part of its emphasis on gun control, the Religious Action
Center is urging local synagogues to launch voter registration
drives, Saperstein said. The center also has developed a package of
educational materials that will be sent to hundreds of Reform and
socially active synagogues. The packets include suggestions on how
to teach conflict resolution and organize local gun turn-in
programs, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an issue we can actually do something about,''
Saperstein said. ``It is the lack of political will or willingness
to stand up to the gun lobby that has thwarted Congress for many
years.''
</P>
<P>
   Gun control has long been an issue some religious organizations
have tried to do something about.
</P>
<P>
   The Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.) first adopted a resolution
favoring controls on the sale and possession of guns in 1968, said
the Rev. Kathy Lancaster, the denomination's associate for criminal
justice national ministries.
</P>
<P>
   The United Methodist Church has in its ``Book of Resolutions''
statements in support of federal legislation to regulate the
``importation, manufacturing, sale and possession of guns and
ammunition by the general public.'' The resolution calls for a U.S.
ban on handguns with exceptions for police, military security
guards and pistol clubs. It also supports a ban on assault weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Catholic bishops also have made statements on violence and
assault weapons.
</P>
<P>
   But not all groups of faith have taken a stand on this issue.
The Southern Baptist Convention does not have a resolution on the
books regarding gun control, said Dwayne Hastings, spokesman for
the convention's Ethics and Religious Liberty Commission.
</P>
<P>
   Hastings said he was not sure why the convention had not tackled
the issue but guessed that perhaps there was ``not a consensus of
belief within the convention.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Baptists, if nothing else, are very diverse at their being,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Though religious organizations have resolutions in favor of gun
control, opinions on the matter may vary within the membership,
said Bill Powers, director of public affairs for the National Rifle
Association of America.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would only hope that religious organizations would respect
the right for law-abiding citizens to peacefully own firearms as
they would expect citizens to respect freedom of speech and
religion,'' Powers said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the pages of paper produced by some religious
organizations, control of guns has rarely topped the list of issues
that grab the attention of the faithful, said Mike Beard, president
of the Coalition to Stop Gun Violence, a research, education and
lobby group founded more than 25 years ago by the United Methodist
Church.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one of those issues that sort of bubbles along near the
top but never breaks through to the top,'' said Beard, whose
organization counts many religious organizations among its 45
members.
</P>
<P>
   In part, gun control gets lost in the shuffle because it's a
perennial issue for many religious organizations, Saperstein said.
With high-profile debates within denominations about homosexuality
or abortion, gun control sometimes loses its urgency.
</P>
<P>
   But religious organizations have a powerful _ if not always
well-funded _ voice on Capitol Hill, Saperstein and other religious
leaders say.
</P>
<P>
   For example, efforts to bring Third World debt to the minds of
congressional leaders has been effective, religious leaders said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is an understanding that no response is a political
response,'' said Peter A. Sulyok, coordinator for the social
witness policy for the Presbyterian Church (U.S.A). ``... If you do
not proclaim your faith, then you are allowing other people to make
the decisions.''
</P>
<P>
   For Saperstein, ending gun violence by controlling weapons is a
theological imperative for Jews and other people of faith.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are partners with God in helping to shape a fair and more
just world and better world for our children,'' Saperstein said.
``An essential goal that we are entrusted with is shalom (peace).
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't talk about bringing peace and healing to a land that
is filled with guns.''
</P>

 &HT;    IRS HIRED PROCESSORS WITH CRIMINAL BACKGROUNDS
 &HT;    By JULIA MALONE
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A new government audit faults the Internal Revenue
Service with ``pervasive'' management flaws that included hiring
workers with criminal charges to process cash, checks and taxpayer
information.
</P>
<P>
   The report, to be issued Tuesday by the U.S. General Accounting
office, the non-partisan investigative arm of Congress, also says
the tax-collecting agency can't balance its own books and handles
unpaid assessments poorly, risking ``potentially billions of
dollars in lost revenue.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the findings in the audit, an advance copy of which was
obtained by Cox Newspapers:
</P>
<P>
   _ The IRS hired 4,835 workers to process tax returns before
receiving results of their fingerprint checks. The agency later
learned that 138 of these employees had questionable backgrounds,
including charges of theft, assault and weapons violations. Of
these workers, 65 were either fired or forced to resign.
</P>
<P>
   _ Employee thefts of receipts reached a reported total of $1
million in fiscal 1999, the year covered by the audit.
</P>
<P>
   _ At one of the 10 IRS tax processing centers, officials gave a
courier a $28 million deposit without asking for identification,
although the courier was unknown to them.
</P>
<P>
   _ The agency made $51 million in bookkeeping errors that its own
accountants failed to discover during an unsuccessful attempt to
reconcile IRS accounts.
</P>
<P>
   _ Nearly $16 million in ``potentially fraudulent'' refunds were
discovered in the first nine months of last year after the checks
were mailed. But the full amount of the invalid refunds mailed by
the IRS ``could be in the billions of dollars.''
</P>
<P>
   _ The agency took as much as 10 years to record some tax
payments, and it took longer than the law allows to remove tax
liens on property in about a quarter of a sample of cases.
</P>
<P>
   IRS and Treasury Department officials were scheduled to appear
before a House Government Reform subcommittee Tuesday morning to
respond to the critique, the latest in a series on the agency's
persistent management problems.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the concerns about the IRS operations are similar to
ones raised in audits going back to 1992, when the agency first
began issuing its annual financial statement.
</P>
<P>
   In a written response to GAO's findings, the IRS conceded that
it has systemic problems and blamed the agency's outmoded computers
for many of them.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Wenzel, deputy IRS commissioner for operations, wrote that
``many of the solutions to the IRS's problems can only be found in
new or enhanced automated systems,'' which he said would take years
to bring on line.
</P>
<P>
   The formal response offered no explanation for hiring workers
before criminal background checks were complete. In the past, IRS
officials have blamed such mistakes on the rush of the tax filing
season.
</P>
<P>
   The GAO auditors credited the revenue service with some
improvements in its record-keeping and computer security and for
instituting a new rule forbidding sending large sums of money by
unarmed bicycle couriers.
</P>
<P>
   The GAO also concluded, as it did last year, that the huge
100,000-person agency managed to accomplish its central tasks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Despite the monumental management challenges it faces, in
fiscal year 1999 IRS succeeded in collecting about $1.9 trillion in
taxes, processing hundreds of millions of tax returns, and paying
about $185 billion in refunds to taxpayers,'' the report said.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the auditors said many of the tax returns
could be improper. They cited the politically popular Earned Income
Tax Credit program, which sends payments to working families with
annual incomes of up to $30,000.
</P>
<P>
   IRS examiners used a screening process last year that targeted
573,000 tax returns claiming $1.5 billion in credits from the EITC,
and they found $1 billion of the claims to be improper.
</P>
<P>
   The GAO noted that the improper payments were often discovered
after the checks had already been sent.
</P>
<P>
   The auditors also panned the IRS for trying to force its
accounts to match the totals reported by the Treasury Department
going back as far as 1995.
</P>

   ``This is similar to an individual not reconciling his or her

MCCAIN'S `GREAT RIDE' STIRRING THE VOTERS 

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ John McCain's insurgent presidential race, as he
points out, has been a ``high wire act.'' But, win or lose, it may
be the only kind of campaign that the Arizona senator can run
because it so closely reflects his risk-filled life.
</P>
<P>
   Buoyed by strong victories in Michigan and Arizona, McCain's
maverick, anti-establishment campaign is on a roll. But if he
eventually trips and falls, it clearly won't be the worst thing
that has ever happened to him.
</P>
<P>
   Political setbacks and even victories can quickly be put in
perspective by a former Navy pilot who has already survived some
for-real, near-death experiences, including five and one-half years
in a North Vietnamese prison.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've crashed a few airplanes,'' he told crowds in Michigan
last week. ``I was in a hotel where there were no mints on the
pillow.''
</P>
<P>
   Only months before he was shot down and seriously wounded over
Hanoi, McCain had to scramble for his life in an inferno on the
flight deck of the U.S.S. Forrestal that killed 134 other
servicemen.
</P>
<P>
   Small wonder that his campaign style is outspoken, often
humorous and sometimes irreverent. Compared to what he has been
through, the contact sport of politics is almost child's play.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's willing to take more risks,'' said John Weaver, the Texan
who is political director for McCain's campaign. ``No matter how
tough things may get on the campaign trail, he's been through much
tougher times.''
</P>
<P>
   Weaver said McCain's entire campaign ``has been a series of
risks,'' including his in-the-face challenge of the Republican
powers-that-be, his open courting of Democrats and his early
decision to ignore the traditional Iowa caucuses and bet on a
strong showing in the New Hampshire primary.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it wasn't for his background, he probably wouldn't be
running, much less running a campaign like this,'' Weaver added.
</P>
<P>
   There is no doubt that McCain has a strong desire to be
president and will continue to fight hard. But his background may
remove any sense of urgency ``that he needs this job in order to
define himself. I don't think you have that with McCain,'' said L.
Tucker Gibson, a political science professor at Trinity University
in San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   Except for the ``big bounce'' that he enjoyed temporarily after
his victory over Texas Gov. George W. Bush in New Hampshire and the
giant boost that he received from his twin victories in Michigan
and Arizona, McCain has run most of his campaign as an underdog.
</P>
<P>
   He has had less to lose than Bush by constantly talking
on-the-record to reporters on his campaign bus and taking
unscreened questions from voters in dozens of town hall-style
meetings.
</P>
<P>
   When a radio talk show host in New Hampshire asked him on the
morning of the primary what he planned to do while people voted,
McCain joked, ``I may go out and tear down some of my opponents'
signs.''
</P>
<P>
   His accessibility has produced a few awkward moments. Once,
answering a reporter's hypothetical question in New Hampshire, he
initially said he would let his 15-year-old daughter decide whether
to have an abortion if she were to become pregnant. But, realizing
that answer didn't square with his strong anti-abortion message,
the senator later said that he had ``misspoken.``
</P>
<P>
   In South Carolina, addressing another sensitive subject, McCain
refused to apologize for using an ethnic slur, ``gooks,'' to refer
to his North Vietnamese captors. But he made it clear that he was
talking only about his former guards and not about Vietnamese or
Asians in general.
</P>
<P>
   McCain also can be sarcastic.
</P>
<P>
   Confronting a questioner in New Hampshire who wanted to legalize
marijuana for medicinal purposes, McCain said he disagreed and then
cracked, ``Good luck with your crop.''
</P>
<P>
   And the tough-guy fighter pilot has emerged in recent campaign
rhetoric.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody's against me,'' he almost yelled at the high school
rally in Saginaw, Mich. ``All the governors, all the senators. But
we're going to kill them, right?``
</P>
<P>
   Later, in Phoenix, he added: ``We're a high-wire act, an
insurgency campaign, and we've had a great, great ride.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's lead in fund raising and organization may soon derail the
senator. And the insurgent faces a strong lineup of closed
Republican primaries in new battleground states, where he will have
to wing it without the independents and Democrats who so far have
been crucial to his success.
</P>
<P>
   But, meanwhile, the ``ride'' continues.

 SUPREME COURT TO CONSIDER LEGALITY OF TESTING PREGNANT WOMEN FOR
DRUGS
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By DAVID STOUT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ About a decade ago, when the use of crack cocaine
was rampant in many cities, doctors and nurses at a hospital in
Charleston, S.C., agonized over what to do about pregnant women who
showed signs of using illegal drugs.
</P>
<P>
   The health care workers at the Medical University of South
Carolina, a public hospital that served many people from poor and
minority neighborhoods, decided in 1989 to do everything they could
to stop the women from hurting their fetuses, perhaps irreparably.
</P>
<P>
   So if a urine test indicated cocaine use, the woman was arrested
for giving the drug to a minor _ the child she was carrying. The
policy was modified to give drug-using women a choice between
arrest and compulsory treatment to shake their addiction.
</P>
<P>
   The crack epidemic has since faded, the Charleston hospital has
discontinued its policy, but a basic issue has not gone away.
Monday, the highest court in the land agreed to decide whether
hospitals can legally test pregnant patients for drug use and tell
the police about those who test positive. A ruling in the case,
Ferguson vs. City of Charleston, 99-936, is expected next year.
</P>
<P>
   The case's journey to the Supreme Court began in 1993, when 10
women sued the hospital, arguing that the urine testing _ without
warrants _ violated their Fourth Amendment right to be free of
unreasonable searches. A federal District Court jury decided
against the women, and last year the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals, in Richmond, upheld the verdict.
</P>
<P>
   The appeals court reasoned that the searches were minimally
intrusive and reasonable under a ``special needs'' exception to the
Fourth Amendment created by the danger to fetuses as well as the
loss of public money because of crack use.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court has declined before to review such
prosecutions, which have been undertaken in at least 30 states
against women suspected of using drugs or, in some cases, alcohol,
during pregnancy. State high courts in Florida, Kentucky, Nevada
and Ohio and Wisconsin have disallowed them, usually on the basis
that a fetus was not a person under the particular criminal statute
at hand. In so ruling, the state courts sidestepped more
fundamental constitutional issues.
</P>
<P>
   But in the fall of 1997, the South Carolina Supreme Court ruled,
3-2, that such prosecutions were allowed, and that a fetus was a
person under the state's child-abuse laws.
</P>
<P>
   So now the U.S. Supreme Court will rule on a policy that a
hospital discontinued several years ago. And given the
unpredictable course of drug addiction in the United States, no one
can say whether the issue is purely academic.

TALKATIVE BIRDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (Science Times)  
 (af)  
 By C. CLAIBORNE RAY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. Do parrots and other birds that talk have any special
physical equipment in the larynx or tongue that helps them speak? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. There is no special equipment, said Dr. Timothy DeVoogd,
associate professor of psychology at Cornell University, just a
highly developed ability to imitate.
</P>
<P>
   DeVoogd, who has studied the development of song in birds, said
the ability to imitate a species' own song was present in all
songbirds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some birds, like woodpeckers or chickens, do not actually
learn songs,'' he said, ``but of the birds that do, some learn a
little and some learn a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the star imitators are parrots, mockingbirds, mynahs and
starlings. ``If these birds spend a lot of time with a human,''
DeVoogd said, ``they will learn a lot from the human.''
</P>
<P>
   It is not certain what brain structures are involved in the
ability to imitate human speech, he said, but if he were to guess,
it would probably be the same structures birds use to learn their
own songs.
</P>
<P>
   These structures were largely mapped by Dr. Fernando Nottebohm
at Rockefeller University. Later research at Cornell found that the
series of structures informally called the song system is larger
and more complex in birds that learn more complex songs than it is
in those that learn simpler songs. &QL;

HOW THE WORLD MIGHT END

<TEXT>
<P>
   By and large, scientists are an optimistic bunch. They are quite
happy to leave fretting about doom and gloom to the philosophers.
</P>
<P>
   Some of them can even remain cheerful when considering something
that most people would regard as deeply depressing: the eventual
destruction of the earth.
</P>
<P>
   The earth's fate is tied to that of the sun, which the laws of
stellar evolution suggest will swell into a ``red giant,''
swallowing the earth up in about five billion years' time.
</P>
<P>
   The details, however, are obscure. George Bowen and Lee Ann
Willson of Iowa State University decided to work them out.
</P>
<P>
   Their calculations suggest that the earth will survive the sun's
initial sudden swelling, but that the drag from the expanded solar
atmosphere will then cause its orbit to shrink until it is
consumed.
</P>
<P>
   The landscape shortly before the end will be apocalyptic indeed.
The surface temperature will reach 2,000 degrees C (3632 degrees
F), the oceans and the atmosphere having long since boiled away.
</P>
<P>
   This will produce a new atmosphere, which will consist not of
oxygen and nitrogen but of vaporized rock. The sky will be a deep,
vivid red because the sun will, in essence, have turned into a huge
red cloud.
</P>
<P>
   The moon will have gone (atmospheric drag will cause it to crash
into the earth). Mars and Jupiter, tearing through the outer
reaches of the solar cloud at supersonic speeds, will appear as
bright streaks in the sky.
</P>
<P>
   The earth's death spiral will last about 2 million years, as its
orbit shrinks and the sun continues to expand.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in a flash, it will all be over. The planet will plummet
into the heart of the sun and disappear.
</P>
<P>
   Or will it? Fred Adams, a physicist at the University of
Michigan, has proposed a novel way in which the earth might escape
this fate.
</P>
<P>
   By running repeated computer simulations, he has worked out what
would happen if a red-dwarf star were to pass through the solar
system.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Adams has found that there is one chance in 100,000 that
this would cause the earth to be ejected from the solar system
before the sun becomes a red giant. The planet would then meet an
icy, rather than a fiery end, since after a million years or so the
oceans would freeze solid.
</P>
<P>
   Bacteria would still be able to live in hydrothermal vents at
the bottom of the oceans, kept going by heat generated
radioactively in the earth's crust. Indeed, they might survive for
as long as 30 billion years. But without a star to keep the earth
warm, other forms of life would be doomed to a chilly death.
</P>
<P>
   In a forthcoming paper in Icarus, however, Dr. Adams advances
another intriguing possibility: the earth could desert the sun and
team up with another star.
</P>
<P>
   This would require a pair of red dwarfs to encounter the solar
system and perform an elaborate gravitational dance with it for a
few thousand years.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of this time, the earth would elope with one of the
red dwarfs, which are extremely long-lived stars and would keep it
at least feebly warm for billions more years.
</P>
<P>
   Admittedly, the chances of this happening are only one in 3
million. But compared with being burned to a crisp, it would not be
the end of the world. &QL;

CHINA: FIRST HONG KONG, THEN MACAU _ NEXT TAIWAN?  
 
</HEADLINE>
   From the Economist magazine  
 c.2000 Economist Newspaper Ltd.  
 (Distributed by the New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ Ever the enigmatic oracle, Mao Zedong once said that
it might take China 100 years to bring Taiwan back into the fold of
a reunified motherland.
</P>
<P>
   Did he therefore attach no particular urgency to the task? Or
did he mean that China should never let up in its efforts to
achieve it, no matter how long it might take?
</P>
<P>
   On Feb. 21, China suddenly stepped up the pressure. In a
government white paper, published by the State Council, the
government's highest body, it said that it would resort to ``all
drastic measures possible, including the use of force'' if Taiwan
were to refuse ``indefinitely'' to negotiate with the mainland on
reunification.
</P>
<P>
   China has long insisted that it has the right to take up arms
against Taiwan, which it considers a renegade province. But until
now it has said it would do so only if Taiwan made a formal
declaration of independence, or if it were occupied by foreign
forces.
</P>
<P>
   Though this week's white paper gives no deadlines for talks to
start, and senior Chinese officials refused steadfastly to be drawn
on the subject, the addition of a third trip-wire for military
action marks a significant _ and worrying _ shift in Chinese
policy.
</P>
<P>
   The timing is not coincidental. On March 18, Taiwan is due to
hold an election to find a replacement for President Lee Teng-hui.
</P>
<P>
   Last year Lee infuriated China by calling for relations between
the two to be put on a ``special state-to-state'' footing. Four
years ago, China had tried to frighten the Taiwanese out of voting
for him, by holding military exercises involving crack troops
opposite Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   As they rehearsed their amphibious assaults, China conducted
``missile tests,'' shooting across the Taiwan Strait and into the
sea near some of its busiest ports.
</P>
<P>
   These shots backfired badly. Not only did Lee win handsomely,
but the United States was so worried that it sent two
aircraft-carrier battle groups to help protect the island.
</P>
<P>
   This time China is hoping to drive down support for Chen
Shui-bian. Chen's Democratic Progressive Party is formally
committed to promoting Taiwan's independence but, realizing that
voters are not keen for a bust-up over the issue, Candidate Chen
has been promising not to declare independence, nor even to hold a
referendum on the issue, unless China uses force.
</P>
<P>
   Chen, however, is not the only man that China dislikes. It would
not be very happy with a victory for Lee's vice-president, Lien
Chan. Lien this week called for ``patience'' in the face of China's
threats.
</P>
<P>
   He had previously been promising to improve relations with the
mainland. But China suspects him of following too closely in the
hated Lee's footsteps. It would probably prefer a win by James
Soong, an independent and the most pro-China of the three main
candidates.
</P>
<P>
   But Chinese threats are unlikely to win Soong friends in Taiwan.
According to the latest polls, the white paper has had no
discernible impact on Taiwanese voters' preferences.
</P>
<P>
   So are China and Taiwan heading for another showdown? Not
necessarily, at least not yet. Neither side is moving troops
around. America has not dispatched any warships, though it has told
China of its ``grave concern'' at military threats to Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   Yet China's new policy shift may end up having a greater impact
than the rocket-propelled diplomacy of four years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Much will depend on what happens after the election. China has
said it wants talks to start quickly. But it has also modified its
own approach in more subtle ways.
</P>
<P>
   The white paper contains no demand that Taiwan must publicly
repudiate Lee's ``state-to-state'' formula. Nor does it insist that
talks on reunification should start before other issues, such as
economic ties, are broached.
</P>
<P>
   And it offers to deal with Taiwan on an ``equal'' footing,
though that hardly sounds like a concession, with the threat of
invasion hanging in the air.
</P>
<P>
   Why the sudden change of policy? ``After the return of Hong Kong
and Macau, it is natural that we have felt a certain urgency in
solving the Taiwan problem,'' explains the Chinese government
spokesman, Zhu Bangzao.
</P>
<P>
   Another possible explanation is that China's president, Jiang
Zemin, is casting around for something more to ensure his place in
China's history books, rather as Deng Xiaoping set his heart on the
return of Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe, but invading Taiwan would present difficulties. Although
China backs its determination to get Taiwan to the negotiating
table with military boasts about how it is ``fully capable'' of
retaking the island, few observers believe it could mount a
successful invasion: China has plenty of troops but they may not be
up to invading Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   China's military planners know this. Those who detect the army's
fingerprints on the new policy see the new sense of urgency as a
way to justify higher military spending.
</P>
<P>
   The risks are high for China too. The more it blusters, the more
it risks pushing Taiwan further towards the independence that China
says it will not tolerate.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, its belligerence is stiffening criticism in
America's Congress, just as two important pieces of legislation are
being considered. One, the Taiwan Security Enhancement Act, would
strengthen America's military ties with Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   This week's threats make it harder than ever for the Clinton
administration to defeat the bill, which has already passed the
House of Representatives and is now before the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Another congressional vote will come later in the summer, when
America must decide whether to grant China permanent normal trading
relations as a step towards its entry into the World Trade
Organization.
</P>
<P>
   That is something China badly wants to achieve before the year
is out. But threatening Taiwan is not the most obvious way to get
it. &QL;

   Unilever, an Anglo-Dutch consumer-goods firm, said that it would
cut 25,000 jobs, 10 percent of its work force, over the next five
years and close 100 factories, after pre-tax profits fell 7 percent

JAPANESE ANIMATION FILMS: TOY STORIES FOR GROWN-UPS  
 
</HEADLINE>
   From the Economist magazine  
 c.2000 Economist Newspaper Ltd.  
 (Distributed by the New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ The increasingly stunning animation emerging from the
United States (in films like ``A Bug's Life'' and ``Toy Story 2'')
is, quite literally, child's play alongside the full-length
animated films that have been pouring out of Japan since the early
1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing could be farther from the comforting world of Bambi,
where formulaic characters and story lines are never allowed to
frighten or offend, than Japan's edgy, provocative,
documentary-like ``anime.''
</P>
<P>
   One is eye-candy for kids; the other a demanding roller coaster
of a ride for people of all ages willing to explore the outer
limits of their fears and longings.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, anime (a Japanese abbreviation of the borrowed
English word) had little more than a cult following outside Japan.
</P>
<P>
   However, animation epics such as Hayao Miyazaki's ``Nausicaa of
the Valley of the Winds'' (1984), Gisaburo Sugii's ``Night on the
Galactic Railroad'' (1985), and Katsuhiro Otomo's ``Akira'' (1988)
have been an inspiration for a younger generation of filmmakers in
the West.
</P>
<P>
   Luc Besson, the influential French director of ``The Big Blue,''
ranks Otomo's nervy ``Akira'' alongside the very best live-action
films from the legendary Japanese director Akira Kurosawa.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, a wider audience has begun to appreciate the efforts
of such groups as Studio Ghibli, Production I.G. and others within
Tokyo's talented anime community.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the credit goes to Disney's art-film unit, Miramax, for
translating Miyazaki's ``Princess Mononoke'' and releasing it in a
selected number of theatres in America last November.
</P>
<P>
   The film _ which pits a medieval people with their greed and
thoughtlessness against the forces of nature in an epic
confrontation that leaves both sides in ruin _ is the biggest
domestic box-office success of all time in Japan.
</P>
<P>
   In America, ``Princess Mononoke'' opened to rave reviews but
less-than-spectacular receipts. Families, expecting typical Disney
fare, may well have been shocked by the film's mature themes.
</P>
<P>
   Of all Miyazaki's work, this is his darkest and most disturbing
film, with a generous share of violence, death and even sexuality,
as well as a conclusion that seemingly resolves nothing.
</P>
<P>
   But despite the film's mixed reception in America, Disney has
(to its credit) followed up with another of Miyazaki's
masterpieces. His animated classic, ``Laputa, Castle in the Sky''
(1986), which is loosely based on a passage from ``Gulliver's
Travels,'' is expected to go on limited release this spring _
though probably not at its original three-hour length.
</P>
<P>
   Half a century ago, it was the rich imagery and psychological
insights of Japan's live-action cinema that astonished and
captivated the West.
</P>
<P>
   Films such as Kurosawa's ``Rashomon'' (1951) and ``Seven
Samurai'' (1954), and Yasujiro Ozu's ``Tokyo Story'' (1953) set new
standards for filmmakers everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   For the past couple of decades, however, Japan's mainstream
cinema has been in decline, at the same time as the country's
avant-garde animators have been reaching new artistic heights.
</P>
<P>
   ``It appears that anime is taking center stage in the Japanese
film industry, pushing live-action movies to the wings,'' says the
author Kenji Sato.
</P>
<P>
   Why should this be so? Cost is certainly part of the answer.
Hollywood has raised the ante in live action to a point where no
one else can match the sums that go into making films like
``Titanic.'' Though not cheap, animation offers a way of making
stylish films without spending anything like as much.
</P>
<P>
   Another factor is the help that anime has had from its close
cousin, manga, the Japanese comic books that have become pervasive
since the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   A number of successful full-length animations, including
Miyazaki's ``Nausicaa,'' have been based on popular manga stories,
and many of today's animators honed their skills in publishing.
</P>
<P>
   But is this enough to account for the Japanese preference for
animation over live action? Why should they feel more comfortable
with a reality that is decidedly two-dimensional?
</P>
<P>
   Could it be _ as Sato wrote in a Japanese magazine, Echo,
shortly after ``Princess Mononoke'' was released _ that the
Japanese moviegoers' flight to anime is part of the ethnic
self-denial that has suffused Japanese society, particularly since
the end of the Second World War?
</P>
<P>
   Bent on achieving the twin goals of modernization and
westernization, Sato claims that ``the Japanese have rejected their
own history and traditions and sought to become Nihonjin-banare
(de-Japanized) _ a generally complimentary term implying that one
looks and acts more like a westerner than the average.''
</P>
<P>
   As Sato points out, an enduring feature of anime as well as
manga is the way that the characters (the females especially) are
drawn with a blend of Japanese and Caucasian features.
</P>
<P>
   ``In short,'' says Sato, ``the characters of anime show the
Japanese as they would like to see themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   This may be going too far. What is for sure, however, is that in
their haste to catch up with and overtake the West, the Japanese
have allowed their delicate framework for dramatic expression to
disintegrate.
</P>
<P>
   Most people in Japan today find it perfectly normal for western
actors to express emotions in a direct and forceful way. But if
Japanese actors do the same, the result comes across as corny.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, for many Japanese the thin, insubstantial reality of
animated film may well appear more alive _ more animated, literally
_ than the flesh-and-blood reality of their own live-action films. &QL;

`FATHER COURAGE': MEN BEHAVING DADDILY  
 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Commentary, Book Editors)   From the Economist magazine  
 c.2000 Economist Newspaper Ltd.  
 (Distributed by the New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   If proof were needed that we are past halftime in the sexual
revolution, it is provided by a lively new book, ``Father
Courage,'' by Suzanne Braun Levine (Harcourt; 228 pages; $24).
</P>
<P>
   A chronicle of the struggles of a sample of American fathers
trying to find a new balance between what the author calls the
``Triple Crown'' (family, work and social life), it shows the other
side of the phenomenon of the working woman: the phenomenon of the
family man.
</P>
<P>
   It begins with some surprising facts: an American survey in
which 93 percent of men and women agreed that the care of children
should be shared equally by both parents; and a finding by the
author that, ``Not one man I spoke to wanted to be the same kind of
father that he had had.''
</P>
<P>
   The 1990s have been described as a decade of ``men behaving
badly.'' ``Father Courage'' suggests that over the next ten years,
at least in America, men may try to make amends by taking on more
of the responsibilities of raising their children.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the issues facing these (inevitably working) men will be
the same as those that faced women, 30 or more years ago, when they
set out to redress what they saw as unacceptable gender imbalances.
</P>
<P>
   First and foremost, there is the guilt. For women, it was mostly
about not being there for their kids; for men, it's about not
maximizing their pay, about not providing ``enough.''
</P>
<P>
   Both sides also have in common an uncomfortable feeling that
they are in denial of the things that they were best designed for:
the deep-seated view that men are outdoor hunter/gatherers and
women are homemaking sucklers...and rarely the twain shall meet.
</P>
<P>
   There are also social and political barriers to be surmounted
before either gender is free to make the sort of choices that will
transform society from one, as Levine puts it, ``in which half of
human experience has been off-limits to the other half of the
population.''
</P>
<P>
   The political landscape could be tilted more in favor of
families, she believes, whilst in the workplace there is ``the
unabated pressure on a man to perform as if he had no other life.''
Employers are rarely as accommodating as they might be.
</P>
<P>
   For Levine, ``The courage to renounce travel stands out as the
signal act of a truly committed parent.'' But few of the companies
which profess to be so keen on equal opportunities for women take
pains to accommodate the fathers who want to be home when the
equally-opportuned mums are not.
</P>
<P>
   Even in the home, Levine says that men have to fight for
equality. Women, she says, are reluctant to ``relinquish the
mystical powers attributed to motherhood and really share the glory
as well as the housework.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the issues facing today's superdads are quite different
from those that faced yesterday's supermums.
</P>
<P>
   By traditional standards, women were fighting to take a step up.
But by those same standards, men are often asking to take a step
down. This presents problems, not so much because it's a step down
to change baby's diapers, but because it's a step down to earn less
than baby's mum.
</P>
<P>
   It makes competition between the sexes continuous and on all
fronts. It turns women into breadwinners and men into consumers.
</P>
<P>
   The pity is that Levine's study is limited to the United States.
For only there has the cohort of baby-boomer supermums created a
generation of men that want to be superdads _ that want (like their
mothers) to have a go at having it all.
</P>
<P>
   In most other parts of the world, women are still raising their
boys to expect the old-style contract in which, in return for
breadwinning, they gain a support structure that keeps their
children (and much else) at arm's length.
</P>
<P>
   Underlying the change in America is the assumption that there is
little that is more rewarding for any parent than to walk
hand-in-hand to school with their adoring seven-year-old and no
agenda other than the walk.
</P>
<P>
   Some fathers have yet to be convinced of this. Even when they
know they can't have it all, they still think they'll be better off
as the chairman of General Motors. &QL;

BOOK CLUBS AND THE INTERNET: A HAPPY ENDING?  
 
</HEADLINE>
   From the Economist magazine  
 c.2000 Economist Newspaper Ltd.  
 (Distributed by the New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   When book-buying on the Internet took off, it seemed as if it
would spell the end of book clubs.
</P>
<P>
   Now the story looks a little different: not so much new
technology kills old business, as old business reinvents itself to
use new technology for its own ends.
</P>
<P>
   The problem for book clubs is that Internet bookshops offer
discounted best-sellers without demanding any commitment from their
customers. Consumers were quick to notice this.
</P>
<P>
   At Doubleday Direct, which is one of America's biggest book-club
companies, the enrollment rate dropped by nearly 10 percent between
1998 and 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Bertelsmann, Doubleday Direct's owners, and, with 25 million
members, the largest book-club company in the world, accordingly
rushed into online retailing. In 1998 it paid $200 million for 50
percent Barnesandnoble.com, and last year it launched bol.com in
Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Last December, Time Warner's Book of the Month Club and
Doubleday Direct's Literary Guild announced that they were joining
forces on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   But beyond all the panic and the consolidation, bits of the
book-club business are finding their way on to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Doubleday Direct has employed Seth Radwell, an e-commerce man
who helped launch Bertelsmann's online retailing, to run Doubleday
Interactive, its Web arm. Radwell is redesigning the book club for
the Web.
</P>
<P>
   The old, general-interest book clubs are never going to be able
to match big online retailers on range, or on discounted
best-sellers. But Amazon and the others will find it harder to
compete in special-interest categories.
</P>
<P>
   For those niches, where newspaper reviews and best-seller lists
are irrelevant, recommendations are particularly important; and the
online booksellers' automated
``people-who-bought-that-also-bought-this'' systems are
unsatisfactory.
</P>
<P>
   Book clubs have people, not software, to make recommendations.
Book clubs also have a different business model: they are not
distributors, but licensed by publishers to produce their own
editions. This enables them to discount all books, and not just
best-sellers.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet even offers book clubs some advantages. It makes
launching specialist clubs cheaper, because small audiences are
easier to find. Radwell is adapting the business so that it can
exploit this.
</P>
<P>
   Among Doubleday Direct's new and upcoming products are Venus
(erotica for women), Black Expressions (for black families), Mango
(for young women), Rhapsody (for romance) and a gay-and-lesbian
club.
</P>
<P>
   The early signs are encouraging. Black Expressions, for
instance, was expected to pick up 5,000 members in the three months
after it went online in October. It got 30,000, and has added
another 10,000 since.
</P>
<P>
   Doubleday Direct's total enrollment through traditional means is
still falling _ it is now down to around 80 percent of 1998 levels
_ but online recruitment is picking up fast.
</P>
<P>
   This year's projections show that by the end of this fiscal
year, in June, the Internet should account for nearly a fifth of
new enrollments, so that total enrollments should be nearly back to
their peak.
</P>
<P>
   At Bertelsmann, hope is slowly replacing panic. &QL;

TRACKING NAZI-LOOTED ART, `THE LAST PRISONERS OF WAR'  
 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (EDITORS: Note Feb. 29 _ 6th graf)   From the Economist magazine  
 c.2000 Economist Newspaper Ltd.  
 (Distributed by the New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Nazi-looted works of art still held in museums and private
collections around the world are ``the last prisoners of war,''
declares Ronald Lauder, head of the art-recovery commission of the
World Jewish Congress in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the claims by Holocaust survivors or their heirs for
compensation for frozen bank accounts, unpaid insurance policies or
forced labor are now being settled. But looted art is the biggest
unresolved Holocaust-era matter, and the trickiest.
</P>
<P>
   At least 100,000 works of art _ some say hundreds of thousands _
stolen by the Nazis have never been returned to their prewar owners
or to their descendants. Russia still holds a further 200,000
pieces.
</P>
<P>
   Efforts to find and identify these works have been intensified
in recent years, ever since the end of the Cold War opened up
Eastern Europe's archives. But so far only a fraction of the
missing pieces have been returned.
</P>
<P>
   Among the most famous are Monet's ``Nympheas, 1904,'' seized by
the Nazis in 1940 and restored by the French government last year
to the family of its French-Jewish owner, Paul Rosenberg, after it
had been identified at the Boston Museum of Fine Arts' Monet
exhibition; and Van Gogh's ``L'Olivette,'' which the National
Gallery in Berlin returned last year to the heir of an Auschwitz
victim.
</P>
<P>
   A growing clamor by lobby groups to step up the pace is
beginning to pay off. On Feb. 29, Britain's National Museum
Directors' Conference will publish its first report on pre-1945
works of art of dubious origin which were acquired after 1933 and
are now held in British galleries.
</P>
<P>
   It is expected to reveal several thousand pieces.
</P>
<P>
   Next month the German government will publish the ``Linz List.''
This refers to a collection of some 13,000 paintings, drawings,
sculptures, pieces of furniture, tapestries, manuscripts, books and
rare coins _ among which lie 1,500 valuable works, including ones
by Italian and Flemish 16th- and 17th-century painters _ which were
acquired for Hitler's planned museum in Linz.
</P>
<P>
   In April the French will report on art looted during the Nazi
years.
</P>
<P>
   The cataloguing of such works is one matter; proving ownership
is another.
</P>
<P>
   Whereas the claims made against banks and insurers could often
be based on documents that had been discovered in vaults, ownership
records in the art world are patchy, not least because many dealers
during the war, and after, asked few questions.
</P>
<P>
   Each claim requires painstaking research; there can be no
blanket deal, as there was, for example, with Swiss banks. Nor are
all countries, or museum directors, keen to lose the masterpieces
now hanging on their gallery walls.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unlike other countries, Britain is not committed to
restitution,'' says Anne Webber, co-chairman of the Commission for
Looted Art in Europe, which represents claimants.
</P>
<P>
   It is a puzzle for curators. They try not to show works that may
have been stolen. And yet, until there is an international registry
of works of dubious origin, displaying the paintings, as with the
Monet, may be the best way for their owners to find them. &QL;

KOSOVO DESCENDS INTO CHAOS  
 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (EDITORS: Note 125-word trim; 1,025 words uncut)   From the Economist magazine  
 c.2000 Economist Newspaper Ltd.  
 (Distributed by the New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MITROVICA _ When Kosovo descended into mayhem last spring, only
a few areas were left untouched. Among them were the ethnic-Serb
towns and villages in the fertile farmland of the far north, and
the eastern hill country whose inhabitants, both in Kosovo and
Serbia proper, were ethnic-Albanian but not much involved with
violent separatism.
</P>
<P>
   Now, as Kosovo's international administrators struggle to assert
their authority, and NATO moves to enlarge its peacekeeping force,
it is these two regions which present the biggest danger _ and may
yet dash hopes of turning the province into a democratic and
law-governed place.
</P>
<P>
   Apart from a recent history of sleepy obscurity, what the two
areas have in common is that both provide tempting raw material for
opportunists and zealots _ on both sides _ who reckon there are
more battles to be fought, and more partition lines to be drawn,
before the status of the region is settled.
</P>
<P>
   Prominent but not alone in the opportunists' camp are
Yugoslavia's president, Slobodan Milosevic, and his proxies.
</P>
<P>
   In a series of Albanian-speaking towns which happen to lie
inside Serbia proper but are optimistically described by some
Albanians as ``eastern Kosovo,'' there is a sense of looming crisis
which recalls the atmosphere in other parts of the region a year
ago.
</P>
<P>
   Ethnic-Albanian fighters have been crossing the border with
increasing frequency to stir up their cousins, and there has been a
large, heavy-handed deployment by the Serbian security forces,
prompting a steady trickle of people to flee into Kosovo proper.
</P>
<P>
   Sensing the rise in temperature, neighboring Macedonia has put
its forces on heightened alert.
</P>
<P>
   A similar tension is crackling in the northern, Serb-dominated
part of the town of Mitrovica, where ill-disguised Serb security
men in plain clothes stand guard in cafes, watching everything that
moves and exchanging messages by walkie-talkie.
</P>
<P>
   For now, the biggest tug of wills over Kosovo's future is
unfolding in the muddy, foggy streets of Mitrovica, where the Ibar
River has become a virtual dividing line between Serbs in the
northern fifth of Kosovo and ethnic Albanians to the south.
</P>
<P>
   How firm that division becomes, and how many families survive on
the ``wrong'' side of the line, will be a hard test for both the
U.N. and NATO, which is rushing to boost the size of its force from
the current level of 30,000.
</P>
<P>
   Confusingly, the battle for Mitrovica is not so much a struggle
between Serbs and Albanians as one between coexistence (at its
barest minimum) and ethnic segregation.
</P>
<P>
   As Bernard Kouchner, the Frenchman who oversees the province for
the U.N., tries to tip the balance in favor of coexistence, he can
count on helpers as well as wreckers among both the two
communities.
</P>
<P>
   Mitrovica and points north are seen as a test-case because they
are the only bits of Kosovo where ethnic Serbs (perhaps 50,000 of
them) have stayed on in significant numbers since NATO troops took
charge last June, enabling the return of nearly 1 million
ethnic-Albanian refugees.
</P>
<P>
   For the Serbs, at least 100,000 of whom have been displaced
since NATO's arrival, the far north is the only place in which they
have escaped ethnic-Albanian revenge; and for Albanians, northern
Mitrovica is the only place where the ``cleansing'' of non-Serbs
continues.
</P>
<P>
   In January, some 2,500 ethnic Albanians were hanging on in the
town's northern part, but in the past few weeks at least 1,000 of
them have been forced to move south, complaining of intimidation.

<P>
   The Mitrovica region's descent into chaos gathered pace after a
rocket attack on a busload of Serbs on Feb. 2, and the killing a
week later of two Turks and six Albanians by Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   As well as exacerbating local hatreds, the cycle of violence in
Mitrovica has run the risk of causing fissures within NATO.
</P>
<P>
   Ethnic-Albanian suspicion of France, perceived as pro-Serb
despite its prominence in bombing Yugoslavia last year, intensified
after a gun battle in Mitrovica on Feb. 13 involving French troops
and both communities.
</P>
<P>
   To demonstrate its unity, NATO is now policing the town with
troops from half a dozen countries _ including the United States,
which is loathed by hard-line Serbs. &QL;

 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Efforts by NATO to impose order, and to confiscate weapons, have
been complicated by a series of demonstrations by ethnic Albanians
over the plight of their cousins in the town's northern part. On
Feb. 21, a march to Mitrovica by tens of thousands of Kosovars
ended in some messy scuffles with NATO troops.
</P>
<P>
   But there are voices of moderation on both sides. The
ethnic-Albanian mayor of Mitrovica, Bajram Rexhepi, has distanced
himself from mass protests, in the belief that confrontation will
not help ordinary townspeople.
</P>
<P>
   Among the Kosovar Serbs, there is a gulf between the
nationalists who dominate the scene in Mitrovica and the
hard-pressed minority in other parts of Kosovo, headed by Bishop
Artemije of the Orthodox church, who lambasts Milosevic. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF OPTIONAL TRIM. STORY CONTINUES TO 1,025) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If passions run high over Mitrovica, that is partly because of
nearby Trepca's mines, producing lead, zinc and some gold and
silver.
</P>
<P>
   Although independent economists doubt whether the neglected
mines will ever yield much profit, Serbs and Albanians alike insist
they are coveted assets which lie at the heart of global, as well
as local, conspiracies.
</P>
<P>
   As for the Serb communities to the north of Mitrovica, most
ethnic Albanians care little about them, and would probably settle
for a land swap whereby the province's northern tip would go to
Serbia, while Kosovo would incorporate the ethnic-Albanian towns
near the eastern frontier.
</P>
<P>
   Why, if that would make both sides happy, will the outside world
not agree? The answer is that any change of borders between the
administrative units of the southern Balkans would set a dire
precedent.
</P>
<P>
   In both Macedonia, where the ethnic-Albanian community complains
of a raw deal from the Slav majority, and in Montenegro, which is
divided over links with Serbia, there are whispers of new partition
lines _ but only after new Balkan wars to decide where they should
run. &QL;

<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ Mexico's long-ruling Institutional Revolutionary
Party (PRI) knows all about the power of cinema.
</P>
<P>
   For 30 years until the 1960s, the country's film industry, like
the PRI itself, enjoyed a golden age. It dominated Latin American
screens, with stirring but politically anodyne tales of love,
treachery and Mexican cowboys.
</P>
<P>
   The industry is much diminished, but the memory of the medium's
power, it seems, lingers on. How else to explain the PRI's clumsy
attempt to censor ``Herod's Law,'' a black comedy which casts a
piercing gaze at that bygone period?
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the film opened; its title is a Mexican saying,
meaning ``You're screwed either way.'' The fuss almost guarantees
it box-office success: it has opened in 200 cinemas.
</P>
<P>
   Set in 1949, the film tells the story of Juan Vargas, a garbage
collector the PRI rewards for his support by appointing him mayor
of a tiny village in the middle of the desert, flouting, for the
fourth time running, an election that had favored the opposition
candidate, the village doctor.
</P>
<P>
   Faced with an impossible mess _ his predecessor has stolen the
budget, the school has been stripped, half the village men have
caught venereal diseases from the brothel, and the brothel-keeper
is in cahoots with the priest _ Vargas quickly turns from an honest
man into a thieving, lying, murdering local chieftain. He thus
enjoys a meteoric rise through the party ranks.
</P>
<P>
   Though it seems almost burlesque, for many Mexicans it is
painfully close to historical truth. But the PRI's control was
(opponents would say is) subtle as well as crude.
</P>
<P>
   Politically awkward films have been rare; filmmakers depended on
government, and exercsed self-censorship.
</P>
<P>
   The few who did not had their work suppressed: ``The Shadow of
the Leader,'' a 1960 film about the machinations of the generals
who took control after the 1910-17 revolution, was not released in
Mexico until 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Also released then, after a year's delay, was ``Red Sunrise,''
about the army's 1968 massacre of protesting students.
</P>
<P>
   Some things have changed. Luis Estrada, the director of
``Herod's Law,'' met only minor objections when he asked the
national film institute, Imcine, to produce his project, despite
its content and the fact that his three previous films had been
flops.
</P>
<P>
   But when senior PRI officials saw the film they blocked its
release, worried that it would hurt the party in the presidential
election in July.
</P>
<P>
   Imcine pulled it from an Acapulco film festival last November.
It then allowed the film to be shown in two small cinemas, without
publicity and with various tricks (such as changing the screening
times) to prevent people seeing it. It backfired. Estrada raised a
stink, and bought the rights back from Imcine.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the PRI has little to fear. The party's core voters
live in poor rural communities, such as the one ruled by Vargas _
and they are not likely to see the film. &QL;

IT'S, LIKE, SO AUTONOMOUS: L.A.'S RENEGADE SAN FERNANDO VALLEY  
 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: California...NOTE 3 trims, 375 words; 1,200 uncut)   From the Economist magazine  
 c.2000 Economist Newspaper Ltd.  
 (Distributed by the New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ When a city contains within its 300-mile boundary
a coastline, several oil fields full of bobbing derricks, tracts of
desert and a large forest, a mountain range is not the prodigious
oddity it would be in most urban environments.
</P>
<P>
   Until now the Santa Monica Mountains have been just one more
aspect of the multifaceted splendor of Los Angeles. Yet this
east-west range may be the seam along which the city is about to
split.
</P>
<P>
   A movement is afoot to break the San Fernando Valley, which lies
to the north of the mountains, away from the larger portion of the
city that lies to their south, creating two cities out of the one
that exists today.
</P>
<P>
   The urge to break loose from a metropolitan mass is showing
itself in other parts of the country, too. Miami, in Florida, has
seen four new cities emerge from its borders since 1992, with maybe
six more in the works. In New York, Staten Island and Brooklyn
periodically strain at the leash.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere in Los Angeles itself, San Pedro and Wilmington, which
holds L.A.'s harbor, are running a joint secession movement.
</P>
<P>
   And on Feb. 15 Hollywood officially launched the campaign to
gather signatures that will set in motion its bid for cityhood
outside Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   The leaders of Valley Vote, the organization behind the San
Fernando independence campaign, are clear about their grievances.
They believe that the Valley's citizens pay for more than they get
from the city.
</P>
<P>
   Their taxes contribute to the city's transport and
infrastructure budgets, and yet they have fewer buses than other
parts of the city and no subway, and pay more for their sewerage
than people outside Los Angeles who have contracts with the
metropolitan sewerage system.
</P>
<P>
   Although the San Fernando Valley's 1.4 million citizens are 39
percent of the total population of L.A., only four out of the city
government's 15 council members come from exclusively Valley
districts.
</P>
<P>
   Even when services are evenly distributed across the entire
city, the separatists complain, they are often poor and
inefficiently delivered by an unwieldy bureaucracy.
</P>
<P>
   The city's schools are a shambles (even among those who do not
wish to break up the entire city there are calls to break up its
Unified School District into smaller boards better able to cope
with the demands of different neighborhoods).
</P>
<P>
   The L.A. police force is up to its neck in its worst corruption
crisis since the 1930s. The Metropolitan Transit Authority is
trapped between powerful construction lobbies and the trade unions
that operate its buses and trains. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM _ 125 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 450) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The San Fernando Valley's discontent has smoldered for decades.
It first flared up in the 1970s, when, as in other American cities,
children were bused to schools far from where they lived in the
name of racial equality.
</P>
<P>
   The reaction against this led to accusations that the largely
white and middle-class Valley was being racist. The charge is still
levelled today. Los Angeles's most notoriously poor and chaotic
neighborhoods are south of the hills, and suspect they are being
dumped.
</P>
<P>
   The Valley's bid for secession appears to be a ``revolt of the
haves,'' in the words of David Rusk, a former mayor of Albuquerque,
N.M., and an advocate of big cities. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF FIRST TRIM) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Although Valley girls and Valley-speak remain the target of
comedians, the San Fernando Valley is a lot more cosmopolitan than
it used to be.
</P>
<P>
   Two-fifths of its population is Hispanic and 9 percent East
Asian, and it has the region's largest Armenian and Farsi-speaking
communities. Vietnamese restaurants and curry shops are as common
as the hamburger stands that were once the limit of the Valley's
cuisine.
</P>
<P>
   Economically, too, the Valley is forging a more varied and
distinctive identity for itself. In the 1970s it depended on
aerospace, filmmaking and tourism (mostly to the Universal Studios
theme park).
</P>
<P>
   Today things are much more diverse. There are high-tech
companies that provide components to the biomedical and
communications industries, a car-design studio opened by General
Motors last year, and a new generation of entertainment businesses
that cover online delivery and digital production.
</P>
<P>
   The Valley has even produced its own muse in Paul Thomas
Anderson, who offers filmic homage to the region's pornographers
(``Boogie Nights'') and other lost souls (``Magnolia'').
</P>
<P>
   The success of Valley Vote's signature-collection drive _ it got
205,000 people to sign up in support of a study of secession, 39
percent of San Fernando's registered voters _ has led to the
creation of a fact-finding commission, largely financed by the
California State Assembly, whose speaker recognizes the validity of
Valley feelings even if he personally does not favor secession.
</P>
<P>
   The commission will assess the economic feasibility of splitting
up Los Angeles, and look into tricky questions such as water supply
that need general cooperation.
</P>
<P>
   A broken-away Valley would not feel exactly lonely. Los Angeles
is crisscrossed by no fewer than 87 independent cities, including
places like Beverly Hills that most outsiders think are part of the
city. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;

<P>
   &UR; (SECOND OPTIONAL TRIM _ 100 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 875) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Many have company-friendly tax regimes at which the Valley's
businesspeople look with envy. Self-determination helps to drive
the search for new ways to deal with local needs. Sometimes a
pooling of interests can block progress.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the problem with L.A.'s schools is that they have been
unable to raise money through bond issues because of the
requirement that such proposals get a two-thirds majority in a
referendum.
</P>
<P>
   Several attempts to pass school bonds have failed when richer
parts of town voted against what they saw as just another tax,
though poorer parts that needed the schools were ready to pay. &QL;

   Left to choose for themselves, smaller entities could go their
separate ways. None of the existing places that insist on being
outside Los Angeles is on the scale of the Valley, which if it goes
off on its own will be the sixth-largest city in America.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, the Valley will not have the political clout of today's
L.A., with its 3.6 million people and its famous name. &QL;

 &LR;  &QL;
<P>
   Secessionists argue that there exists an overarching body, even
bigger than the city of Los Angeles, that can pull together the
interests of the whole metropolitan area. This is Los Angeles
County, whose 10 million people and $15-billion budget make even
the city seem a relative midget.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles County, they say, should be able to speak with the
panache that Angelenos from both sides of the mountains believe
their city deserves. Yet it has always been with the city's mayor,
not the chief of the county's board of supervisors, that presidents
come to talk.
</P>
<P>
   This has held true even when it meant crossing party lines.
Ronald Reagan and George Bush sat down with the Democratic mayor,
Tom Bradley, not with the county's then-Republican leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Today it is to the Republican mayor, Richard Riordan, that
President Bill Clinton turns, not to his fellow Democrats on the
county board.
</P>
<P>
   The Valley separatists may have good local reasons for going it
alone, but they will be trading some national buzz for the better
buses they deserve. &QL;

JOHN MCCAIN AND THE GHOST OF VIETNAM  
 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (NOTE: 2 trims, totaling 350; 1,125 words uncut)   From the Economist magazine  
 c.2000 Economist Newspaper Ltd.  
 (Distributed by the New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   John McCain may be splitting the Republican Party asunder. But
when it comes to the rather more important question of the country
as a whole, he is more of a healer than a divider.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since Saigon fell to the Communists in 1975, the United
States has been suffering from post-Vietnam stress disorder. McCain
is a vital part of the country's struggle to put the disorder
behind it.
</P>
<P>
   The Vietnam War divided the United States more bitterly than any
war other than the Civil War. It maimed two presidencies. It
undermined the country's faith in its great institutions, as the
left railed against the people who got the country into the war and
the right railed, equally angrily, against those who made such a
hash of getting it out.
</P>
<P>
   It turned people not just against the ancient ideal of military
service but against the ideal of public service in general.
</P>
<P>
   If America's current malaise can be described as private
affluence and public anomie, then Vietnam bears much of the blame.
</P>
<P>
   In previous presidential campaigns the war has been the secret
that dared not speak its name. Bill Clinton could hardly feel
America's pain on the subject when he spent the war not inhaling in
Oxford.
</P>
<P>
   But many leading Republicans found it hard to accuse him of
being a draft-dodger when they too pulled strings to make sure that
they and their kind avoided service. Both Dan Quayle and George W.
Bush spent the war defending their native states against invasion
from their next-door neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, however, is putting the war at the heart of his
campaign. His acolytes do not turn up to his rallies carrying
portentous policy documents, as Bill Clinton's acolytes turned up
in 1992 with copies of ``Putting People First.''
</P>
<P>
   They turn up clutching copies of McCain's memoirs, ``Faith of My
Fathers,'' holding it aloft while he is speaking, often with tears
rolling down their faces.
</P>
<P>
   The book is all about how McCain found himself by going to serve
in Vietnam, and a constant refrain of his speeches is that his
fellow countrymen can find themselves, too, if they will only
rediscover the virtues of public service. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM _ 175 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 375) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The change in the mood about military service began with an
outpouring of emotion about the Second World War. Steven
Spielberg's film, ``Saving Private Ryan,'' succeeded in mixing
bloody battle scenes with an uplifting story about an attempt to
save a mother from seeing her fourth son suffer the same fate as
his brothers, and die in the war.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Brokaw's ``The Greatest Generation,'' a book about the men
and women who came of age in time for that war, has been on the New
York Times best-seller list for over a year.
</P>
<P>
   McCain provides the perfect link between the greatest generation
and the Vietnam generation. The white-haired senator looks as if he
could well have suffered at the hands of the Nazis rather than the
Communists.
</P>
<P>
   And his book is as much about his grandfather and father _ both
of them four-star admirals who saw distinguished service in the
Second World War _ as it is about himself. &QL;

</P>
<P>
   The impact of ``Faith of My Fathers'' is stunning. It makes
Vietnam less of an isolated disaster, more a part of a grand
tradition of military service.
</P>
<P>
   The task of rehabilitation is made all the easier by the fact
that McCain spent most of the war being tortured by psychopaths,
not mowing down innocent villagers. &QL;

   On Oct. 26, 1967, he had to eject himself from his aircraft in
the sky above North Vietnam, breaking his left arm, his right arm
in three places and his right knee. A crowd of Vietnamese then
broke his shoulder with a rifle butt and bayoneted him in the
groin.
</P>
<P>
   The guards at the Hoa Lo Prison _ the infamous Hanoi Hilton _ at
first refused to give him medical treatment unless he revealed
military secrets and confessed to being a war criminal.
</P>
<P>
   Then, on discovering that his father was commander-in-chief of
the Pacific fleet, they tried to turn him into a propaganda tool.
They wanted him to denounce America in return for medical
assistance. They also offered to release him, only to have the
offer rejected.
</P>
<P>
   When he was at last released, after five-and-a-half years in
captivity, he weighed less than 98 pounds and was unable to comb
his own hair, because his broken bones had healed so badly. &QL;

</P>
<P>
   McCain's record in the war explains his appeal to two unexpected
groups of people. The first are the working-class Democrats who
came out to vote for him in such impressive numbers in Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   These are the people whose fathers went off to fight in Vietnam
while their richer countrymen stayed at home burning flags and
getting degrees. And they are also the people who seethed with rage
when Jane Fonda shrilled for the Vietcong and Hollywood movies
turned Vietnam vets into drug-hazed zombies.
</P>
<P>
   The second group, the normally liberal chattering classes, is
rather more confused about its enthusiasm for McCain.
</P>
<P>
   Journalists are supposed to like him because he offers them free
doughnuts and unparalleled access. But the bright people's
enthusiasm for McCain runs much deeper than this, and extends to
those who have never set foot on his ``Straight Talk Express.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain speaks to the professional classes' guilt about not
serving in Vietnam just as clearly as he speaks to the Reagan
Democrats' anger about serving and being betrayed.
</P>
<P>
   In 1983 Christopher Buckley wrote a famous article lamenting the
fact that he and most of his peers had managed to get out of
serving in Vietnam. Much of the article was taken up with
remembering that he and his friends suffered not a jot of
deprivation at home while their less privileged countrymen were
dying in Southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
   But part of it was a meditation about what they had lost by not
going. ``We forfeited what might have been the ultimate
opportunity, in increasingly self-obsessed times, of making the
ultimate commitment to something greater than ourselves: the
survival of comrades.''
</P>
<P>
   The betting is still, though more warily, that the Republican
machine will propel Bush to the nomination this summer. But even if
McCain fails to capture his party's nomination, he may succeed in
doing something even more important.
</P>
<P>
   The notion of public service has been comprehensively trashed in
the wake of Vietnam, by the government-hating right as much as by
the establishment-bating left.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to McCain, it might just possibly be on its way to
becoming fashionable again. &QL;

SEATTLE: AMERICA'S `SPOILED RICH KID' GETS A REALITY CHECK  
 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Seattle...NOTE 2 trims, total 175; 1,000 uncut)   From the Economist magazine

 (Distributed by the New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ ``This is the weirdest state I ever saw,'' says a
Seattle man who has lived in Washington state for 23 years after
spending time in Chicago, New York and California.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has never had a problem. Washington has cheap electricity,
no real social problems, companies like Microsoft, Boeing,
Starbucks and Nordstrom, a mild climate _ it's the spoiled rich kid
of the nation.''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, but even for a rich kid life has problems (ask George W.
Bush). This is beginning to dawn on Washington, and not least on
the state's largest city, Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the trouble is, on the face of it, just bad luck.
Seattle was host to the recent mugging of the World Trade
Organization (WTO).
</P>
<P>
   Then an Algerian was arrested in Port Angeles, on the state's
border with Canada, allegedly with a carload of explosive materials
bound for Seattle; so the city's millennium-eve party got
cancelled.
</P>
<P>
   There were a lot of people from Seattle among the 88 killed when
Alaska Airlines Flight 261 crashed on Jan. 31.
</P>
<P>
   And now the most celebrated sportsman in the city's history, Ken
Griffey, Jr., center-fielder for the Seattle Mariners baseball
team, has decamped to Cincinnati, Ohio, a vulgar place of steamy
summer heat and barbecued pork.
</P>
<P>
   But there are also disquieting clouds on the economic horizon. A
decade of prosperity unmatched almost anywhere in the country may
be losing some of its brightness.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing, which employed 104,000 people around Seattle in 1998, is
now down to under 80,000, and the number will fall further as
Airbus Industrie's challenge to Boeing obliges it to cut
production.
</P>

   Outside Seattle the forest-products industry is a shadow of its
pre-spotted-owl self, and the normally lucrative agricultural
sector based on wheat and apples has suffered badly from Asia's
economic downturn.
</P>
<P>
   The state total of unemployment claims is bigger than it was a
year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Most tellingly, moving companies say that more people are now
leaving Washington state than are moving into it. This is a
remarkable turnabout.

<P>
   Immigration has exceeded emigration for nearly 25 years, and as
recently as 1997 newcomers outnumbered departures by two to one.
</P>
<P>
   Reasons for leaving mentioned to your correspondent include:
better job opportunities elsewhere (California, Oregon, Utah, North
Carolina); cheaper housing (darned near anywhere except San
Francisco and Manhattan); less rain (absolutely anywhere in the
United States). &QL;

   If yesterday's newcomers had known more about the state's
history they might have been less surprised by some recent events.
</P>
<P>
   Take the WTO fiasco. Long before the Seattle area was home to
Microsoft and Amazon.com, it was the stamping ground of the most
militant trade unions on the West Coast. That streak of radicalism
still exists, and no doubt provided some of the demonstrators at
the anti-WTO riots.
</P>
<P>
   It was ``utterly unrealistic,'' says Walt Crowley, a local
historian, to think that Seattle's anti-globalizationists would
turn up at the WTO meeting and just ``quietly register their
objections.''
</P>
<P>
   The area's leftist past may also help to explain a growing
resentment about the huge income disparities of the Seattle
region. &QL;

   In King County, which encompasses Seattle and cities such as
Redmond (where Microsoft is based), 23,500 cosseted software
workers earn an average of $287,700 a year apiece, including share
options. The median household income of everyone else in the county
is $34,300.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, despite the wide reach of the new prosperity,
that can be a real cause of indignation.
</P>
<P>
   The uneasy coexistence of new wealth and old tightwad populism
produces some curious contrasts. A $500 million new baseball
stadium completed last summer, and financed in large part out of
taxes, is the most expensive sports center in the nation.
(Unfortunately Griffey disliked it, and set off for Ohio.)
</P>
<P>
   But then, in November, voters overwhelmingly approved a measure
that cut the state's vehicle-license tax _ formerly about $400 a
year for a car valued at $20,000, though less for cheaper ones _ to
a flat $30 per vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   That shot a torpedo through the budgets for new roads and a
better ferry system, and is going to make the Seattle area's
traffic jams, already the country's third-worst, even more
maddening. &QL;

   &UR; (SECOND OPTIONAL TRIM _ 50 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 725) &LR;  &QC;

   The irritation is not diminished by the fact that the city

should be allowed into the city (they are badly treated, said the
opponents). Result: elephants in, by a five-to-four vote. &QL;

   The next few years could be interesting. Michael Parks, the
editor of a Seattle business newsletter, worries that Airbus, whose
order book was greater than Boeing's last year, might seize the
leadership of the aerospace industry.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing seems distracted by its recent merger binge and a
surprising strike by usually tractable white-collar engineers.
</P>
<P>
   Other fears are that the Asian economic recovery will prove less
muscular than hoped (the port of Seattle is a major export route to
Asia) and that the Department of Justice may carry out its veiled
threats to break up Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle could even find itself left behind in the dot.com
revolution, since local companies such as Amazon.com,
HomeGrocer.com and Drugstore.com have staked their all on the
consumer market just when the business-to-business dot.com market
looks like an even bigger profit-maker.
</P>
<P>
   Still, quite a bit of sunshine manages to push its way through
the recent clouds.
</P>
<P>
   Unemployment in the state remains a modest 3 percent.
Construction crews are swarming over new high-rise buildings in
Seattle and big suburban areas such as Bellevue.
</P>
<P>
   And the high-tech money that has bathed the region in its glow
has led to a Medici-like investment in the arts, philanthropic
endowments that make Andrew Carnegie seem a miser, a spate of
cracking good restaurants, and a bull market for BMW dealerships.
</P>
<P>
   Weird? Spoiled? Does anyone here really care? &QL;

   &UR; HEALTH-CARE STRATEGY OF THE WEEK: &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   During a town-hall meeting in South Carolina, George W. Bush was
asked what he would do about a woman's medical insurance which
doesn't cover her son's chronic illness. Bush's analysis: ``I'm
sorry. I wish I could wave a wand.'' (Salon.com, Feb. 18) &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; FACTOID OF THE WEEK: &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Some 23 million Americans watched the Fox television show ``Who
Wants To Marry A Multimillionaire?'' on Tuesday night. At the same
time, 3 million people watched the Republican presidential debate. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; HUNK OF THE WEEK: &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore, who was challenged to take part in the ``stakeout
workout.'' The ``workout,'' practiced by bored cameramen, consists
of weightlifting with a 30-lb. camera. Gore impressed watchers with
nine curls with his right arm, six with his left. He also swung the
$75,000 camera over his head several times. (Los Angeles Times,
Feb. 20) &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BACKHANDED COMPLIMENTS OF THE WEEK: &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Former New York Senator Al D'Amato on John McCain: ``He is the
Don Quixote of modern-day politics.''
</P>
<P>
   Representative Sam Johnson of Texas on Bush: ``He was a pilot in
the Texas National Guard. So it's not like he doesn't know the
military.''
</P>
<P>
   Congressman J.C. Watts, filling in for a delayed Bush in South
Carolina: ``In order to be a good president, you don't have to be a
foreign- or domestic-policy wonk. You can buy dozens of policy
wonks. You don't have to be clever. You can buy clever.'' (New York
Times, Feb. 19) &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; FOOD OF THE WEEK: &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Crisp rashers. As Bush left a restaurant in Greenville, S.C.,
over the weekend, a truck pulled up and dumped a load of cow manure
on the street. The driver got out of the truck, dressed as a pig,
shouting, ``Meat is death! Pork is murder!'' Bush later commented,
``I'm glad I had bacon for breakfast.'' (Los Angeles Times, Feb.
20) &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; SONG OF THE WEEK: &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   As jubilant supporters waited for George W. Bush's victory
speech in South Carolina, a pop group strutted on stage to
entertain the crowd. The large contingent of white-haired dames
looked unhappy enough at the lead singer's leather trousers; but
when he opened his set, unhappiness blossomed into disgust.
``Living the Vida Loca, with skins the color of mocha,'' the man
intoned, as the dames headed for the door. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; DUBIOUS TACTIC OF THE WEEK: &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   The McCain campaign admitted, then denied, telephoning
supporters and entering their donations online. Internet experts
now question whether the senator's record $4 million, raised via
his Web site, resulted from high-tech genius and a spontaneous
groundswell of support or just good old-fashioned glad-handing. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BUSHISM OF THE WEEK: &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   ``I will say to countries in the Middle East, don't you dare
hold us hostile.'' (Detroit, Feb. 21) &QL;

</P>
<P>
   &UR; DELEGATE TOTALS OF THE WEEK: &LR;  &QC;
</P>

   Bush, 67; McCain, 96. A Republican candidate requires at least
1,034 of the 2,066 national delegates. &QL;

WHY BUSINESS IS DOTTY ABOUT DOT.COMMERCE  
 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Commentary Editors...NOTE 100-word trim; 1,025 uncut)   From the Economist magazine  
 c.2000 Economist Newspaper Ltd.  
 (Distributed by the New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Is it a fleeting fancy, or a life-changing love? The question
lingers over today's obsession with the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   On one side, electronic commerce is exploding, and the stock
markets' dot.com mania seems to be migrating from America to Europe
and Japan, and even to emerging economies.
</P>
<P>
   On the other side, delivery snarl-ups have besmirched the
reputation of electronic retailers, and profits from doing business
on the World Wide Web are largely nonexistent.
</P>
<P>
   What is one to conclude? Let's sift through the sense and
nonsense surrounding the business-to-consumer e-boom.
</P>
<P>
   There is much hype, but there is also a solid base in reality.
And this suggests that the second answer to the lingering question
is closer to the mark.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet is profoundly affecting almost all business and
commerce. A common slogan is true: any big firm that fails to
grapple with the consequences is putting its future at risk.
</P>
<P>
   Numbers tell only part of the story. In 1999 global e-commerce
was worth a little over $150 billion. Around 80 percent of those
transactions were between one business and another.
</P>
<P>
   Yet growth of all forms of e-commerce is hectic.
Business-to-business Web exchanges are mushrooming. In America
e-retailing revenues tripled last year; in Europe and Japan they
rose faster still.
</P>
<P>
   The absolute level of consumer e-commerce is still small, at
around 1 percent of American retail sales. But in some areas its
share is far higher: 15 percent of retail stockbroking and 5
percent of book sales, for instance.
</P>
<P>
   The influence of the Internet stretches farther than such
figures suggest. It is used more as a source of information than as
a place to buy.
</P>
<P>
   Surveys in America suggest that last year, when less than 3
percent of new car sales were made over the Web, 40 percent
involved it at some stage, usually for price comparisons.
</P>
<P>
   And e-commerce often needs to take only a small share of the pie
to have a big impact on what is left. Travel agents' margins are so
flimsy that a loss of 3 percent of their market to the Web would be
enough to push many out of business.
</P>
<P>
   One impact is thus to intensify competition, producing benefits
to consumers in lower prices and more choice, at the expense of
producers and intermediaries. But a more profound effect is a
wholesale restructuring of businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to the rise of e-commerce, such giant firms as General
Motors, Ford and, this week, Unilever, are embracing the Internet
for many of their activities. And the giants' move means that their
suppliers, as well as intermediaries through whom they sell, must
take to the Internet too.
</P>
<P>
   The promised land that this ripple effect holds out is one of
more transparency, greater efficiency and, yes, higher
productivity.
</P>
<P>
   Hard macroeconomic evidence of these things is admittedly still
elusive. But it is at least conceivable that new technology and the
Internet may be partly responsible for America's unexpectedly
strong recent productivity growth, as well as its surprisingly low
inflation.
</P>
<P>
   So is the Internet leading to economic nirvana _ and does
dot.com mania make sense? Not quite.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet may be transforming business; but it is not
rewriting economics to enable the American economy to expand at its
current rate without dangerously overheating. Nor does the
explosion of e-commerce justify the current high prices of many
Internet-related shares.
</P>
<P>
   On the contrary, all the signs are that the markets remain in
the grip of a technology-related bubble. Many equity markets
currently look overvalued.
</P>
<P>
   But Internet shares are causing particular concern, for two
reasons. One is simply that their overvaluation looks so huge.
</P>
<P>
   Because few make profits, normal earnings-related measures
cannot be used. But even enthusiasts concede that as many as 80
percent of today's Internet companies may not survive _ just as
almost all the early railroads, carmakers and airlines did not.
</P>
<P>
   Behind the hype, investors are reflecting this. Shares in
profitable technology providers such as Cisco, Oracle or Sun
Microsystems are doing well. But nearly three-quarters of
Internet-related initial public offerings in America since mid-1995
now trade below their issue prices.
</P>
<P>
   And over the past year the shares of several big American
e-commerce firms have crashed: eToys (down 80 percent from its
peak), Priceline (down 69 percent) and E*Trade (down 66 percent),
for example.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet bubble in Europe and Asia seems sure to be followed
by similar collapses.
</P>
<P>
   The second concern is one voiced by managers of traditional
(non-tech) firms. Their share prices, they say, have been savaged
just because investors are, irrationally, redirecting their capital
into glamorous technology and Internet firms.
</P>
<P>
   Some say they are being punished despite healthy results;
several talk of a misallocation of capital from profitable to
loss-making activities. Yet many of these gripes are misplaced.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet bubble is clearly distorting the market, and its
bursting may well cause pain across the whole economy. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (100-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE AT 825) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, whenever firms can raise capital virtually free, they
are likely to waste much of it, as so many dot.coms are now doing
with their marketing expenditure. But there is little evidence that
traditional firms' shares are undervalued, or that they are finding
it hard to raise capital.
</P>
<P>
   And the capital going into Internet firms is not all being
wasted _ even if today's shareholders may not reap the benefits.
This is especially true of makers of computers and the Internet's
infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
   But even an e-retailer such as Amazon needs robust computers,
software and delivery systems _ all of which necessitate
investment. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF OPTIONAL TRIM. STORY CONTINUES TO 1,025) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The bigger point is that the markets are sending traditional
companies two useful signals. One is that they ignore the Internet
at their peril.
</P>
<P>
   The second is that merely adding a Web site on to an existing
business is not enough: the whole business needs to be redesigned
around the cost-saving, communication-easing properties of the Net.
</P>
<P>
   Most companies must become Internet firms if they are to
survive. Even when the bubble deflates, that signal will be worth
heeding. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   ``An event of historic proportions,'' was the Clinton
administration's judgment on the reformists' victory in Iran's
parliamentary election last Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Can the United States now build on this historic, but still
fragile, event by improving its own bad relations with the Islamic
republic? It would be the waste of a chance if it failed to do so.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past couple of years, the Americans have made tentative
efforts to start a political dialogue with the Iranian government.
These have been spurned.
</P>
<P>
   President Muhammad Khatami has welcomed people-to-people talk,
but has not felt strong enough, in the face of the hostility of his
implacably Great-Satan-hating adversaries, to extend this welcome
to official negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   Now Khatami and his supporters are on a roll, able to override
crude sniping. A resumption of relations would please most
Iranians.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the reformers' attitude towards the United States
remains defiant. The door is open, they say, but it is up to
America to walk through it, carrying gifts.
</P>
<P>
   Although the years in which the United States tried to
``contain'' Iran are long gone, American laws or rules prohibit
virtually all commercial transactions between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
   However, since the ban on investment in, and trade with, Iran
dates from a 1995 executive order, Clinton can, if he so decides,
modify it without congressional approval.
</P>
<P>
   American oilmen, frustrated as their competitors grab contracts
with Iran, are hungry for an easing of the regulations. For their
part, the Iranians would be happy if they were allowed to export,
say, their carpets or caviar to America.
</P>
<P>
   Even more important to Iran would be a U-turn in America's
determination to block it from any Caspian pipeline deal: Iran
aspires, not unreasonably, to be one of the principal corridors
bringing Caspian oil and gas to market.
</P>
<P>
   Iran is also insistent that America should show some give on
what it calls its ``frozen assets.'' The shah ordered, and paid
for, American military goods and services which, after the 1979
revolution, were not delivered. The dispute is before the
American-Iranian claims tribunal in The Hague, an arbitration body
set up in the early 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Although some of the claims have been settled, Iran is still
trying to claim amounts that go into billions of dollars. It would
be good to tie up all this business, maybe with a unilateral
American offer of a lump sum, even if that involved congressional
approval.
</P>
<P>
   If America were to tempt Iran to negotiation with juicy tidbits,
what should Iran offer in return?
</P>
<P>
   Some years ago, Iran stopped slinging money around the world to
terrorist groups. It still supports Lebanon's Hezbollah guerrillas
and will continue to do so as long as Israel occupies south
Lebanon. But it could commit itself to stop, once Israel has left
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   Iran could also commit itself to supporting Yasser Arafat in the
Palestinian-Israeli peace process, thus taking the vitriol, and
much of the danger, out of its traditional anti-Israeli stance.
</P>
<P>
   All this is important. But a main reason behind America's
sanctions is to deny Iran the money that it might otherwise spend
on weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
   Iran, once the victim of Iraqi aggression, lives in a rough
neighborhood, surrounded by people who not only have ballistic
missiles but also nuclear capacity (Russia, India, Pakistan,
American forces in the Gulf).
</P>
<P>
   It has signed the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, but remains
suspect. It is bound to look to its own security. But it would
lessen suspicion if it subscribed to the newly tightened nuclear
safeguards _ which would cost it nothing if, as it claims, it has
no military nuclear ambitions.
</P>
<P>
   Iran is on the cusp of reformation. There are still powerful
forces bent on keeping it in the darkness of petty rules and a
harsh clerical judiciary.
</P>
<P>
   Its reforming leaders, rejecting any hint of patronage, still
feel they have to move with great caution in their dealings with
the United States. But the election gives America an unusual
opportunity to help the reformists and further its own strategic
interests. It should seize it. &QL;

A FUNNY THING HAPPENED ON THE WAY TO THE CORONATION...  
 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Commentary Editors)   From the Economist magazine  
 c.2000 Economist Newspaper Ltd.  
 (Distributed by the New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   This week the Republican Party took one great step forward and
one huge step back in its quest to recapture the White House.
</P>
<P>
   The step forward was to capture the imagination of the American
electorate. Voters of all parties are flocking to the Republican
primaries.
</P>
<P>
   In South Carolina, Senator John McCain had been expected to pick
up momentum from his win in New Hampshire. Instead he was trounced
by George W. Bush. Three days later, Michigan seemed certain to
dispatch McCain; yet he won by seven percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican race, now heading towards a showdown in New York
and California on March 7, is the most exciting since Gerald Ford
and Ronald Reagan battled it out in 1976.
</P>
<P>
   But there is also that backwards step to consider. To win in
South Carolina, Bush ``turned negative'' with a ferocity that few
expected. McCain's response has been only a little more
gentlemanly.
</P>
<P>
   Worse, the squabbling party seems to be splitting in a way that
could spell disaster in the general election in November.
</P>
<P>
   With McCain picking up the votes of independents, Bush has been
dragged to the right. Conservative posturing, such as making a
speech at a South Carolinian university that forbids interracial
dating, may help the Texan win the nomination, because the next
primaries are nearly all ones in which only registered Republicans
can vote.
</P>
<P>
   But such shenanigans could put off the independent voters that
the nominee will desperately need in November. This helps explain
why, even as the Republican race grips the attention, much of the
(supposedly) smart money in Washington is shifting towards Al Gore,
the likely Democratic candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, there is even the suspicion that minority politics might
actually suit some hard-core Republicans in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Held hostage by special interests and the religious right,
outmaneuvered by President Bill Clinton at every turn, their only
remaining clarion-call has been to propose cutting taxes far more
than the electorate wants. Such tactics lead towards a political
ghetto.
</P>
<P>
   From now on, Bush and McCain must seek to avoid that fate.
McCain's chance of doing so looks the better one. His candidacy
should anyway have two big attractions for all but the most
narrow-minded members of his own party.
</P>
<P>
   First, he is a true-blue conservative. How an anti-abortion,
pro-deregulation, pro-gun war hero could ever be deemed
unacceptably liberal remains a mystery.
</P>
<P>
   Second, he stands for moral leadership which, combined with his
passion for campaign-finance reform, could skewer the
ethically-challenged Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, one sad fact of the Republican Party's recent history
is that it often takes an outsider to reform it _ and make it
electable. Ronald Reagan and Dwight Eisenhower were such creatures;
McCain could be another.
</P>
<P>
   Bush is still the party's front-runner, and still stands a fair
chance in November. Yet he risks finding himself trapped by the
relentlessly rightward path he has adopted.
</P>
<P>
   Independents make up 15 percent of the electorate; every
conservative fusillade from Bush's lackeys against McCain sends the
independents shuttling towards Gore.
</P>
<P>
   He could, nevertheless, redefine himself once again. After all,
the Bush family has a habit of running dirtily but governing
cleanly (President Bush, now revered as a statesman, used the
infamous Willie Horton advertisement against Michael Dukakis).
</P>
<P>
   And, if nothing else, Bush, who in New Hampshire gave the
impression that electioneering bored him, has shown that he really
wants the job. Indeed, in his desperate transformation, he has
mimicked that other dynastic scion, Gore.
</P>
<P>
   The vice-president's campaign against Bill Bradley has also been
mucky and disingenuous. And Gore has been dragged to the left on
issues such as trade and gays in the armed services.
</P>
<P>
   Come November, Gore could also be painted as an extremist _
provided, of course, that Bush can inch a bit closer to the center.
That is not impossible.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's political credo has been somewhat traduced by the
campaign. By most standards, his record is reassuringly moderate.
On issues such as trade and immigration, he has stood out against
the nastier isolationist tendency in his party.
</P>
<P>
   It is hard to imagine that a man who speaks fluent Spanish and
has a Latina sister-in-law really stands for white racist values,
as he has sometimes seemed to suggest.
</P>
<P>
   In Texas, his achievements in education are real enough. And he
can point to a decent record of constructive cooperation with
Democrats. Remember, it was this moderate, inclusionist, optimistic
George W. Bush who once led Gore in the polls by 19 percentage
points.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Republicans' choice should have little to do with
being fair to either candidate. The point of this exercise is to
choose the man most likely to beat Gore in November.
</P>
<P>
   On that measure, the choice should surely be John McCain. Of the
two, he has demonstrated the clearest ability to appeal to
independent and Democratic voters, which will be crucial in turning
a party victory into a presidential one.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, he is most clearly the man for the post-Clinton
moment, the anti-Gore: clean, heroic, straight-talking, likely to
stand up strongly for democracy's interests around the globe.
</P>
<P>
   The Economist disapproves of his positions on guns and abortion,
and of his anti-tobacco stance. But if we had a vote, then on the
evidence so far it would go to Senator McCain. &QL;

   CHAIRMAKING-LIFEBEAT _ Perhaps it has something to do with our
goal-oriented American lifestyle, but many of today's travelers are
going on vacation not to relax and ``do nothing,'' but rather to

along the way. A case in point: the 15 men, who traveled to Mike
Dunbar's Windsor institute, in Hampton, N.H., to learn how to make
sack-back Windsor chairs. By Matthew Holm. (1,100 words)

buttonhooks, they were regularly used by women, often by children,
occasionally by men. And, although they came in a seemingly
infinite number of shapes, sizes and materials, every one had the
same function _ to hold fabric taut while being darned. They are
stocking darners. By Wayne Muller. (1,000 words)

<TEXT>
<P>
   The clock above Jamie Speyer's desk reads 5:05 p.m. It's 25
minutes until time to pick up her son at day care, and she's still
in her Portland, Ore., office in the middle of preparing for the
next day's presentation.
</P>
<P>
   She calls her husband, Sam, but he's stuck in a meeting. She
dials her neighbor's number, but there's no answer. With no other
choice, Jamie throws her work in her bag, grabs the night's grocery
list, and runs out of the office with a cell phone glued to one
ear.
</P>
<P>
   She makes it to the day care center in time but out of breath,
hurries her son, Jonathan, out the door, and finds herself so
distracted by the mess she left behind at the office that his
cheerful babbles barely register during the car ride.
</P>
<P>
   When she pulls into the driveway, she's relieved to see that Sam
and her 7-year-old, Lynn, are already home. Lynn is eager to see
Jamie, too, and lets her know it by running up to squeeze her,
sending her bag flying through the air, scattering work papers
everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone thinks it's very funny, but Jamie isn't laughing.
Although she'd been looking forward to being back home with her
family since she left in the morning, her mind is now on overdrive.
</P>
<P>
   Despite our best intentions, slipping out of work mode and into
the role of parent doesn't automatically happen just because we've
walked into our home and reunited with our family. Rather, a
successful transition hinges on how quickly we can change our
mindset _ so, of course, shifting gears goes more smoothly at some
times than at others.
</P>
<P>
   Luckily, there is a five-step plan for those of us who find the
work-to home adjustment challenging.
</P>
<P>
   FIND TIME TO DECOMPRESS
</P>
<P>
   Step one in securing a smooth integration into family life
requires a bit of mental preparation. ``Walking through the front
door when your mind is still on problems at work is like jamming
the air waves,'' said Dr. Susan Heitler, author of ``The Power of
Two: Secrets to a Strong &AMP; Loving Marriage.'' The solution,
according to Heitler, is making a mental shift from focusing on
office issues to your family.
</P>
<P>
   After 2-year-old Matthew's birth Charlotte Friedlander of White
Plains, N.Y., found household life was dominated by her new baby's
needs.
</P>
<P>
   ``At work, I worried about the shopping list that kept growing
or the laundry I hadn't done, while at home I worried about what I
needed to do at the office,'' said Friedlander, who works full-time
for AT&AMP;T. She began using part of her hour-long train commute to
jot down To Do lists of tasks to accomplish that evening. The
result, she says, is that she feels better prepared when she
arrives home, which helps her to relax and enjoy time with her
family more.
</P>
<P>
   Some parents lack the luxury of commuting time for collecting
their thoughts. As a freelance medical writer, editor and mother of
two in Brookline, Mass., Lisa Underhill works primarily from her
house. She spends mornings in her home office while Miranda 5, and
Gabriel 7, are in school, and devotes afternoons to the kids.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no clear demarcation for where my work ends and
family life begins,'' Underhill said. ``It's all contained in the
same environment.''
</P>
<P>
   Making the mental leap from one world to the other can be
difficult, she conceded: ``I'll be playing with the children and
hear my office phone ringing. It's taken some practice, but I've
learned to tell myself `This is family time' and let the answering
machine pick up the call.''
</P>
<P>
   Positive mental imagery can help ease the transition from work
to family, Heitler said. Whether during your commute or on your way
to meet the school bus, before reconnecting as a family, take a few
minutes to escape into fantasy. Picture greeting your kids, hugging
them, asking them about their day.
</P>
<P>
   ``Make sure to focus on the positive ways you will interact with
your family. This puts you in control,'' she said. But avoid
``unrealistic expectations about how your kids or spouse will act,
which sets you up for failure.''
</P>
<P>
   For example, imagining that your tantrum-prone toddler will
suddenly turn into a saint is an unlikely fantasy and one you have
little control over. But imagining that when your child's tantrum
strikes you will respond in a calm loving manner can better prepare
you for the reality of home life.
</P>
<P>
   PUT KIDS FIRST
</P>
<P>
   By the time you walk through the front door, your To Do list is
probably longer than your grocery list: Open the mail, check the
answering machine, start dinner. But for your little one, a
parent's return means it's playtime _ right now! Finding time for
yourself takes sensitivity and planning.
</P>
<P>
   As for those nights when you feel like disappearing into your
bedroom just for a minute to get a little breathing space, think
again.
</P>
<P>
   ``Taking 10'' immediately upon arriving home is not always the
best plan of attack for parents of young children. Dr. Frances
LaBarre, a psychologist in private practice in New York City, said:
``Babies and toddlers may believe that Mommy disappears because
she's angry or doesn't want them.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, spend 15 minutes or so with your child when you get
home. This lets him know that his wants are a priority for you,
said LaBarre. ``Your child feels secure knowing that you are tuned
in to his needs. Spending those few minutes focused on your child
reassures him that he is what is most important to you,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   BE SURE TO FIND TIME FOR YOURSELF
</P>
<P>
   Together, Friedlander and her husband, Michael, have worked out
a routine. When Friedlander returns from work, she relieves the
sitter and spends some time playing games with her son. Half an
hour later Michael arrives home, and while he reacquaints himself
with Matthew, Charlotte takes off for a short jog to clear her head
and have a few minutes of ``me time.''
</P>
<P>
   Parents need to find what works for them, said Dr. Heitler.
``Every family has its own rhythm,'' she said. Good communication
and a joint effort can lead to a routine that works for everyone.
</P>
<P>
   Because her husband's long hours as a systems analyst mean he
often arrives home late, Underhill juggles two children, family
dinner preparations and household chores single-handedly on many
evenings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mothers are always cutting corners to save minutes and the
first thing to go is time for yourself,'' Underhill said.
Unfortunately, this strategy eventually backfires. ``You find
yourself snapping at your kids, or keeping it all inside and just
stewing,'' Underhill admitted. So now, in the midst of chaos,
Underhill reminds herself that once the children are asleep, she
can steal a few moments of relaxation during her nighttime bath.
</P>
<P>
   LET YOUR CHILDREN IN
</P>
<P>
   How you establish a connection with your children can make or
break the rest of the evening. A friendly hug and warm words are
the first steps toward breaking down the walls we erect around
ourselves during the, workday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Work and home are two very different cultures,'' Heitler said.
``It's like speaking a different language. It can take time to
decompress from the pressure of job situations.''
</P>
<P>
   You can ease the transition by saving any serious discussions
with your kids until you've had a chance to settle in. ``As a rule
of thumb,'' said Heitler, ``reserve touchy topics for a time when
you are neither tired nor hungry.''
</P>
<P>
   Feeling irritable can instigate unpleasantness that might
otherwise have been avoided. In other words, now may not be the
time to lecture your child about doing chores.
</P>
<P>
   But what if you've had a particularly rough day at work? Should
you tell your children? Absolutely, said Underhill. ``I don't
unload on them, but it I'm honest. I explain that Mom is cranky but
it has nothing to do with them. Sometimes, they'll give me a big
hug and say 'It's OK.'''
</P>
<P>
   LaBarre agreed: ``If you are feeling really stressed, don't
ignore your own needs,'' but rather than pushing your kids away,
let them be involved. The key is to get yourself in the moment and
be present for your child even if you're not feeling so hot.
</P>
<P>
   You might say, ``I'm so glad to be home and to see you,
sweetheart, but I've had a hard day. I want very much to see the
picture you drew today, but first Mommy has to put her purse down,
take off her coat, and write a note to herself. Why don't you come
with me and keep me company while I do it?''
</P>
<P>
   This way you include your child in your transition, LaBarre
said, and your stress can be soothed by what you both were looking
forward to all day: spending time together at home.
</P>
<P>
   MAKE IT MEMORABLE
</P>
<P>
   ``Transition time can become a period of celebration for a
family,'' Heitler said. Occasional treats, for example _ such as
having a favorite breakfast food, like pancakes, for dinner or
drawing a picture before eating supper _ can be a great way to
start the evening off on the right foot.
</P>
<P>
   Easing into family time with a good children's book is another
great starter because it helps you unwind and helps your children
focus and calm down from afternoon activities.
</P>
<P>
   The truth is, along with the happy days, we all have some
not-so-great periods of family time. But knowing how to avoid
uncomfortable or upsetting snags in the job-home transition process
puts you one step closer to end-of-the-day success.
</P>
<P>
   After all, since work meets family at least five times a week,
this is one rendezvous that is important to get right.

<TEXT>
<P>
   When Sharon Gretz Lasky found out she had melanoma last August,
she wasn't ready to surrender to cancer. ``I didn't want to feel
powerless, like a rock rolling down a hilt,'' said the 42-year-old
mother of three. ``I wanted to be in charge of my health.''
</P>
<P>
   Therefore, her treatment consisted not only of surgery to remove
a block of tissue from her thigh and lymph nodes, but also of
acupuncture, craniosacral therapy, hypnosis and biofeedback.
</P>
<P>
   Best of all, Lasky was able to get top-notch conventional and
alternative care under one roof. After her cancer was diagnosed,
she began treatment at the three-year-old Center for Complementary
Medicine at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center Shadyside
Hospital. The same health-care network that featured her oncologist
and plastic surgeon for tissue reconstruction also included an
acupuncturist, a massage therapist and other alternative
practitioners.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone who worked with me _ the surgeons, the acupuncturist,
the nutritionist and the rest _ were part of my health-care team,''
she said. ``They treated my cancer, but they also helped me through
my fears, so I went into surgery incredibly calm and confident.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Lasky got help in dealing with pain and
recuperation _ and the news that she'd need a second operation to
remove a spot from her lung. Thankfully, the tissue in her lung
proved noncancerous, and she left the hospital in half the expected
time and with much less pain medication.
</P>
<P>
   This integrative approach to treating an illness certainly isn't
new. But the fact that Lasky was able to get multifaceted treatment
at a single facility is indicative of a growing trend in health
care: the integrative medicine facility. Across the country, an
ever-increasing number of conventional hospitals and health-care
organizations are setting up complementary-care centers.
</P>
<P>
   As yet, no one is tracking these centers as a group, but last
year, the American Hospital Association found that roughly 9
percent of U.S. hospitals offer complementary services; some
estimates say that between 25 and 50 complementary centers
affiliated with hospitals are presently open or will be opening in
the near future.
</P>
<P>
   Many of these facilities are fully staffed with medical doctors
and alternative practitioners who work together to determine each
patient's course of treatment. Others offer individual therapies
such as therapeutic touch or guided imagery to patients who ask for
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look at what was happening even a few years ago, the
extent to which complementary services have become part of the
health-care system is astonishing,'' said John Weeks, editor and
publisher of The Integrator, a newsletter covering the business of
alternative medicine. ``We're really in the first phase of a
process that will evolve over the next 10 or 20 years.''
</P>
<P>
   ``As we see more and more consumers making health-care decisions
for themselves, this trend is really going to take off,'' said Dr.
Samuel Benjamin, director of the Center for Complementary and
Alternative Medicine at the State University of New York, Stony
Brook. ``There will be only one medicine in the future, and it will
include all of the things that we once thought of as either
alternative or conventional.''
</P>
<P>
   What's more, demographics support the notion that these centers
are here to stay. ``Baby boomers are hearing that they could live
to 80 or 90 or 100, and they want to be healthy doing it,'' Weeks
said.
</P>
<P>
   An expected squeeze in the labor market in the next several
years should prompt companies to seek more and better services with
which to attract and retain employees. At the top of any worker's
list: better health care. ``Patients are going to demand more
complementary medicine, and they're going to demand it right in the
hospital they're using,'' said Dr. James N. Dillard, medical
director for alternative medicine at Oxford Health Plans in New
York City.
</P>
<P>
   Many complementary-care clinics are also moving beyond patient
care to address one of the biggest concerns in integrative
medicine: the information shortfall. Patients often use alternative
therapies in a smorgasbord-like way, without a complete
understanding of the advantages or risks involved.
</P>
<P>
   ``Part of what got me into the development of our center is that
I knew my patients were already using alternative therapies,'' said
Dr. Mimi Guarneri, an interventional cardiologist and the medical
director of the Scripps Center for Integrative Medicine in La
Jolla, Calif. ``They were out there buying every vitamin and herb
they could find, and I was concerned that they might not know
enough about what they were taking.''
</P>
<P>
   With this in mind, hospitals like Scripps have set up classes to
inform patients about various alternative therapies.
</P>
<P>
   Since traditionally schooled physicians are often unduly
skeptical about complementary approaches, many clinics have also
made research and analysis part of their standard operations.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we don't evaluate the evidence with an objective eye,
there's no way that complementary therapies can ever be brought
into the medical mainstream in a way that makes sense,'' said
Guarneri. ``As a physician, you can't stand up and present
anecdotes without being thrown out of the room.''
</P>
<P>
   Virtually all of the centers track patient outcomes and share
that information with other hospitals nationwide. Many centers are
conducting comprehensive studies on the effects of individual
therapies _ the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, for one,
is researching complementary treatments for asthma, while George
Washington University's Center for Integrative Medicine in
Washington, D.C., is looking at the use of acupuncture in treating
carpal tunnel syndrome.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, what matters to patients isn't hard-core data but
real-life outcomes. And in that respect, the news is positive.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many complementary therapies can help people face an illness
more calmly, use less pain medication and recover more quickly,''
said Dr. Lewis Mehl-Medrona, program director for the Pittsburgh
medical center and the author of ``Coyote Medicine.''
</P>
<P>
   Tracy Cunning definitely agreed. The 35-year-old research
assistant received therapeutic touch and massage at the Center for
Health &AMP; Well-Being at St. Luke's Hospital in Cedar Rapids, Iowa,
while undergoing knee surgery at the hospital. (She also had
acupuncture treatments at an unaffiliated center nearby, with her
doctor's blessing.)
</P>
<P>
   Just one day after her surgery, she put away the crutches she'd
been given; by the third day, she'd tossed her pain pills, having
taken only six of the 30 that had been prescribed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone was very supportive,'' she recalled. ``I sailed
through surgery and was up and moving around much more quickly than
I'd expected. I think the care I was given made a big difference.''
</P>
<P>
   OPTIONAL SIDEBAR FOLLOWS
</P>
<P>
   THE INSURANCE QUESTION
</P>
<P>
   Will the fact that so many hospitals are bringing complementary
therapies under one roof mean less out-of-pocket costs for
consumers?
</P>
<P>
   Probably not _ at least, not right away, said Dr. James N.
Dillard, medical director for alternative medicine at Oxford Health
Plans in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that these centers are opening will put pressure on
insurers to pay for more things,'' he said. ``But that will take
time. Right now, we're seeing very few insurers paying for any
alternative medical treatment beyond chiropractic, which is
licensed in all 50 states.''
</P>
<P>
   But chiropractic is the one treatment that most of these centers
have the hardest time offering, he said. ``Most academic medical
centers freak out at the mere mention of the word.''
</P>
<P>
   So where does that leave consumers? ``You'll see massage offered
at most of the centers, but most insurers won't pay for it,''
Dillard said. At best, you'll get a discounted rate.
</P>
<P>
   How about acupuncture, therapeutic touch or nutritional
counseling? ``Maybe,'' he said. ``But it's still not too common, no
matter where it's provided.''
</P>

   Insurance companies are motivated by numbers, he explained,
meaning they will pay for treatments that are cost-effective. So
the pressure is on the complementary-care centers to track patient
outcomes and prove to insurers that alternative treatments work as
well as _ or better than _ conventional treatments in managing
disease and keeping costs down.

<P>
   There was a time when no proper household would be without at
least one. As common as sadirons and buttonhooks, they were
regularly used by women, often by children, occasionally by men.
And, although they came in a seemingly infinite number of shapes,
sizes and materials, every one had the same function _ to hold
fabric taut while being darned.
</P>
<P>
   They are stocking darners (or darning eggs, balls, bells,
spools, mushrooms), once highly esteemed in the days of the ``use
it up, wear it out _ make do, or do without'' society that has been
shunted aside in today's disposable one. Yet this humble tool is
emerging again as a fascinating, attractive and highly sought after
collectible.
</P>
<P>
   A 19th-century instruction manual for teachers describes the
virtues of darning as part of the American public-school
curriculum: ``If wisely taught, it develops the thrifty
dispositions and habits of neatness, cleanliness, order, management
and industry''
</P>
<P>
   First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt, who remained an avid knitter and
sewer throughout her adult life, was taught to darn by her nurse at
the age of six. According to a placard at the Franklin D. Roosevelt
Library and Museum in Hyde Park, N.Y., ``If she made a mistake, the
nurse would cut out the yarn, thus making the hole larger, and have
her start again.''
</P>
<P>
   Darners were made from nearly every conceivable material, most
commonly wood, as well as stag horn, mother-of-pearl, porcelain,
ceramic, celluloid, plastic, Bakelite, papier-mache, ivory, brass,
aluminum and tin. While some glass darners were commercially
produced, many of them were intended not to actually be used but to
showcase glassblowers' artistic talents. Darners ranged in size
from 1/4-inch miniatures to 9-inch-long mushrooms with 4
1/2-inch-wide caps.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently almost everyone who used a darner had his or her own
idea of what the perfect darner should look like. The U.S. Patent
Office, for example, issued more than 100 patents for this humble
tool between 1865 and 1956. The 1920s marked the height of patented
darners, when 17 distinct models were recognized.
</P>
<P>
   One design goal was to make darners out of substances that would
not dull needles, which were relatively expensive instruments. So
some darners were created out of wax, soap and rubber, while others
had long-pile fabric faces.
</P>
<P>
   Another objective was to keep the stocking from slipping as it
was mended, resulting in the addition of metal bands, spiral
springs, elastic or rubber bands, and sometimes plastic or wire
bristles.
</P>
<P>
   A further consideration was to avoid stretching or misshaping
the stocking. Rows of pins were consequently applied to the darner,
to impale the fabric as one worked. Darner designers also tried to
make it easier to work by using contrasting and bright colors.
Eventually the ultimate in visual darning aids _ illuminated
darners, both battery- and electric-powered _ were developed.
</P>
<P>
   Today most of us tend to relegate a holey sock to the rag drawer
instead of reaching for the needle and thread, but many individuals
still do practice the ``waste not, want not'' principle.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Epstein, a psychotherapist in Berkeley, Calif, admitted
in a published article: ``I especially like to mend socks. Please
think twice before throwing your socks away. By mending them, you
may also be mending the holes in your life, and creating a
treasure.''
</P>
<P>
   By and large, however, the practice of darning has fallen by the
wayside. Fortunately, reminders can readily be found. Common wooden
darners often appear at flea markets for less than $10. And some of
the more unique pieces now command much higher prices: An art-glass
piece, for example, recently sold at auction for around $1,000.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of darners have found their way to contemporary
collections. Since millions were manufactured, there are
undoubtedly thousands more tucked away in sewing boxes and trunks,
just waiting to be discovered. So why not check around your house
and start your own collection? Darners don't take up much room, are
relatively inexpensive, make for interesting conversation, and add
a unique and colorful touch to your home.
</P>
<P>
   SIDEBAR
</P>
<P>
   THE KING OF DARNER'S
</P>
<P>
   Darner historian Wayne Muller said he picked up his first darner
in a coastal California antiques shop in 1977 at the urging of his
wife, Mary, who suggested that he make a small purchase to placate
the storekeeper, who was trying to close up the shop. The next day
the couple stumbled upon two more darners and their collection was
born.
</P>
<P>
   The Mullers now own more than 500 examples from 21 countries. To
showcase what is considered to be the largest collection in the
world, the Mullers had a series of raised wooden shelves, with
drilled holes to cradle the darners, custom-built for their family
room.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to lecturing on darners, Muller has published ``Darn
It: The History and Romance of Darners'' (L-W Book Sales; 1995), a
160-page softcover book that includes comprehensive chapters
detailing both the history of this utilitarian tool and the
evolution of stockings, as well as a price guide.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Perhaps it has something to do with our goal-oriented American
lifestyle, but many of today's travelers are going on vacation not
to relax and ``do nothing,'' but rather to attempt an activity
they've never tried before, learning new skills along the way.
</P>
<P>
   Busy people are definitely ``trying to maximize their vacation
time,'' said Caroline Haberfeld, editor of Fodor's Great American
Learning Vacations (Fodor's; $17). Whether they enjoy cooking,
gardening or woodworking, more and more Americans are choosing to
visit interesting, out-of-the-way destinations where they can
pursue new interests and bring home more than just snapshots or a
T-shirt.
</P>
<P>
   A case in point: the 15 men, including myself, who traveled to
Mike Dunbar's Windsor institute, in Hampton, N.H. Over the course
of five eight-hour days, we hoped to learn how to transform pieces
of raw oak and pine into sack-back Windsor chairs that we would be
proud to display in our living rooms.
</P>
<P>
   My classmates included contractors, a carpenter, an engineer, an
anesthesiologist and a nurse anesthesiologist (co-workers who came
together), a truck driver and a retired shop teacher, among others.
Nearly all have workshops in their garages or basements. Most of
these people, however, rarely find the time to use them. Planning a
vacation at the Windsor Institute forces some 300 people a year to
set aside enough time to actually complete a project.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the students received this ``learning vacation'' as a
birthday or anniversary gift from their wives. But pupils often
bring their families along: While students wrestle with wood,
spouses and children can relax and play in Hampton, a historic
seaside resort located less than an hour's drive north of Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Skill levels varied widely in my class. I was admittedly the
least-experienced woodworker in the bunch, but Dunbar was quick to
tell me not to be intimidated.
</P>
<P>
   ``Making a Windsor chair is the great equalizer,'' he
proclaimed. ``When people tell me they don't have any experience, I
say, 'No problem. You can make a chair because it's like nothing
else you've ever done.'''
</P>
<P>
   And he was right. I could immediately tell by the awkward ways
in which other students handled the unfamiliar drawknife, pommel
knife, scorp, gutter adze, spokeshave, travisher, reamer and spoon
bit that all the carpentry experience in the world does not matter
if you've never laid eyes on any of the specialized tools before.
</P>
<P>
   Dunbar discussed the history and characteristics of the Windsor
chair for a few hours the first morning, then we headed to the
shop: four students to a bench, each with his own vise.
</P>
<P>
   We gathered to watch as Dunbar demonstrated each step in the
process. Afterward, we would set out to try the technique ourselves
while Dunbar and his assistant, Dan Faia, circulated among us,
offering hands-on help when needed.
</P>
<P>
   We started out with lengths of unshaped, split red oak, which we
fashioned into bows, arms and spindles using a drawknife, a
spokeshave and a plane. Each task posed a new challenge, but the
learning curve was quick: The first back spindle I whittled was
precariously thin; my seventh looked nearly as round and even as
one of Dunbar's.
</P>
<P>
   The most invigorating _ that is to say, terrifying _ step may
have been shaping the seat. To hollow out the saddle, we laid the
rough pine plank on the floor and, standing on top of it to keep it
in place, swung an axlike gutter adze into the wood, just a few
inches from our toes. It sounds risky, but as Dunbar assured us,
``No one has ever drawn blood.'' Still, I'm glad I wore work boots.
</P>
<P>
   While my classmates were all male, many classes are coed. One
out of every 10 students is a woman, Dunbar said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You should see my tool bag,'' said Brandy Ward, of Nashua,
N.H., who made a sack-back at the Windsor Institute last year.
Ward, who had scant woodworking experience, almost did not take the
class after she was discouraged by a professional chairmaker who
``just didn't think a woman _ especially one with no experience _
could make a chair. Fortunately, Mike told me different,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Building Windsors can be habit-forming _ one of my classmates
had come back to Hampton for his third session.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our stated purpose is to have you go home and make more
chairs,'' Dunbar said. Just be careful that you don't suddenly find
yourself in the chairmaking business, as some 10 percent of
graduates do. ``And never sell a chair that you've made,'' he
warned jokingly. ``For me, this was just a hobby that got out of
control.''
</P>
<P>
   After five days of whittling, drilling and gluing, my chair was
assembled and surprisingly sturdy. I brought it home to my wife,
who is trying to decide where to place it in our apartment _
perhaps beside the writing desk in the foyer. I'll leave that up to
her; I'm too busy trying to figure out how I might fit a workbench
and a steam box into the living room.
</P>
<P>
   IF YOU GO
</P>
<P>
   Wood and instruction for the Windsor Institute's sack-back class
cost $600; prices for advanced classes vary. Faia also offers a
tool-sharpening course the Sunday before each five-day session and
a finishing class the Saturday after for $100 each.
</P>
<P>
   Call Dunbar (603-929-9801) for recommendations about local
lodging, food and transportation, as well as a materials list. The
institute will lend out a number of woodworking tools, but many
students prefer to buy their own.
</P>
<P>
   OPTIONAL SIDEBAR
</P>
<P>
   OTHER WORKSHOPS
</P>
<P>
   Each summer, women escape to Marshall, N.C. (nestled in the
Smoky Mountains), for Country Workshops' women-only wood working
course. Relaxed and noncompetitive, the class teaches women basic
carpentry skills as they each build a small cabinet (828 656-2280).
</P>
<P>
   At the other end of the state, any would-be woodworker can spend
a week on Albemarle Sound in Hertford, N.C., at the picturesque
Beechtree Inn. There, Benjamin C. Hobbs shows how to craft a Queen
Anne-style bench or a queen-sized pencil post bed (252-426-7815).
</P>
<P>
   For an urban workshop experience, visit John
Alexander/Greenwoodworking in Baltimore, where students make chairs
and stools from lumber they've split from logs (410-685-4375).
</P>
<P>
   And at the Woodworker Academy in Alameda, Calif., across the bay
from San Francisco, students can learn to make anything from a
small sofa table to a wall-size display cabinet (510-521-1623).

   &UR; MENTAL HEALTH: When Despair Invades the Blood Vessels &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Feeling hopeless is not just unpleasant: it may also be bad for
the health.
</P>
<P>
   A study suggests that people suffering persistent periods of
hopelessness may be at greater risk for hypertension, researchers
at the University of Michigan report. Their study, in the latest
issue of the journal Hypertension, said they had come to their
conclusion after analyzing health records of 616 middle-aged men
who took part in a major study in Finland.
</P>
<P>
   Over four years, 20 percent of the men studied became
hypertensive, defined as having blood pressure above 165 over 95.
But the figure shot up to 37 percent of the men considered ``high
in hopelessness'' and 23 percent of those considered to feel
moderately hopeless.
</P>
<P>
   Feeling hopeless is often a sign of depression, but the
researchers said it appeared that hopelessness was a better
indicator of potential hypertension problems than depression.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; TESTING: Early Intervention for Babies' Ears &LR;
</P>
<P>
   A new team of researchers has weighed into the debate over
whether infants should be routinely screened for hearing loss at
birth.
</P>
<P>
   Although some experts believe that such testing is unwarranted,
researchers from the University of Colorado at Boulder are offering
evidence to the contrary.
</P>
<P>
   Addressing a meeting last week of the American Association for
the Advancement of Science, Dr. Christine Yoshinaga-Itano said that
earlier detection and action helped hearing-impaired children
achieve normal language skills.
</P>
<P>
   ``The studies of more than 350 deaf and hard of hearing children
show a very short critical period of normal language development in
this population,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers found that when doctors, using state and federal
grants, were able to conduct so-called universal screening of
newborns, congenital hearing loss was identified at about 2 months
of age, instead of what they said was now the average: 2.5 years.
</P>
<P>
   Among deaf children who received their diagnoses by the time
they were 6 months old and received treatment, 90 percent developed
vocabulary skills for use in sign language that were considered
within the range of normal. Of those identified as having hearing
problems later in life, only the top 25 percent were able to gain a
vocabulary similar to the bottom 10 percent of children with normal
language development.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; SENSATIONS: Acquiring a Taste for Cold Weather &LR;
</P>
<P>
   It's not just various foods that cause the tongue to experience
the pleasures and discomforts of flavors.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers at Yale say they have proven that the four major
tastes _ sweet, sour, salty and bitter _ can, under the right
conditions, also be produced by changing the temperature of taste
buds. Warm tastes sweet and sometimes bitter; cold can seem salty
or sour.
</P>
<P>
   Why? No one is certain. It may be part of the body's attempt to
make sense of the mass of information it gets from food, said Dr.
Barry Green, an otolaryngologist, who reported the findings in
Nature.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers said they were simply examining the temperature
sensitivity of taste buds when they made the discovery.
</P>
<P>
   A research assistant, Alberto Cruz, detected a slight sweet
taste when a tiny part of his tongue was chilled and then reheated.
Similar results occurred when the researchers tried to test
themselves. Then, they decided to experiment.
</P>
<P>
   When they tested 24 subjects, 21 said they could discern at
least one kind of taste associated with temperature, and 19 could
taste two or more.
</P>
<P>
   As a practical matter, it is not clear how much this all affects
a person's sense of taste (although it raises the possibility that
some people may experience ice cream as being ``saltier'' than
others).
</P>
<P>
   To achieve the effect, Green said, the tongue, must first be
chilled to 68 degrees and then rewarmed _ ``and that just doesn't
happen in the course of normal eating.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BEHAVIOR: The Two Worlds of Teen-age Pregnancy &LR;
</P>
<P>
   The United States may be at the top by most economic measures,
but for an important measure of social health _ teen-age pregnancy
and childbearing _ it moves among the poorest.
</P>
<P>
   American teen-agers are best compared to those in the Russian
federation or in depressed Eastern European countries like
Bulgaria, a new study finds. Teen-age pregnancy and childbearing
rates here are at least four times those in France, Germany and
Japan, said researchers from Alan Guttmacher Institute, which
researches reproductive health.
</P>
<P>
   The institute's president, Sara Reims, said the problem was in
part the result of poverty and inequity, but also the reflection of
insufficient sex education and low-cost, easily obtainable
contraception. ``Our young people deserve better,'' she said in a
statement, adding that Americans had much to learn from Western
Europeans.
</P>
<P>
   Still, in the 1990s, the report said, Americans saw a 17 percent
decline in adolescent pregnancy and childbirth. This mirrored a
larger trend over the last 25 years among industrialized nations,
as well as an overall decline in childbearing among women of all
ages.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers suggest that the decline was a result of several
factors, including greater emphasis on education and employment,
more motivation to delay sexual intercourse among teen-agers, and
whatever their limits, improved sex education and contraception.
</P>
<P>
   The researcher said the most recent birthrate among girls 15 to
19 was 54 per 1,000 in the United States, 49.6 in Bulgaria, 10 in
France and 3.9 in Japan.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; PROGNOSIS: Undue Optimism When Death Is Near &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, it just doesn't pay to be optimistic, or, at least,
overly so.
</P>
<P>
   A new study reports that doctors who treat terminally ill people
routinely overestimate how much time their patients have left, and,
as a result, may deprive them of the kind of care they need.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers at the University of Chicago studied the cases of
343 doctors and 468 patients admitted to hospices over 130 days in
1996. Dr. Nicholas A. Christakis and his colleagues, reporting in
the British Medical Journal, asked the doctors to predict how long
their patients would live. The median survival was 24 days, but
some 63 percent of the doctors overestimated the time, by a factor
of 5.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Experts said the implications were troubling: the optimism could
delay referral to hospices, which emphasize management of pain and
grief. This could explain why patients on average spend about a
month in hospice care, when the ideal is considered to be three
months.
</P>
<P>
   ``Doctors who do not realize how little time is left may miss
the chance to devote more of it to improving the quality of
patients' remaining life,'' the researchers wrote. And, they added,
the doctors may contribute to patients' making bad choices,
including seeking aggressive but futile treatments.
</P>
<P>
   The report said that the better doctors knew their patients, the
more optimistic the doctors seemed to become. One solution, they
said, may be to get second opinions from disinterested
practitioners, especially specialists.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those of us who know our patients longer often become attached
to them,'' Dr. Julia L. Smith, medical director of a hospice in
Rochester, N.Y., wrote in an accompanying article. ``We, too, hate
to admit that death is near.'' &QL;

<P>
   VIRGINIA BEACH, Va. _ Taking his presidential campaign to a
stronghold of Christian conservatism, Sen. John McCain of Arizona
delivered a harsh attack Monday on the ``self-appointed leaders''
of the religious right, depicting them as egotistical and
intolerant empire builders who ``have turned good causes into
businesses'' while attempting to exclude all but ``card-carrying
Republicans'' from the party.
</P>
<P>
   McCain singled out for criticism two of the Christian right's
best-known leaders, Pat Robertson, the founder of the Christian
Coalition, and the Rev. Jerry Falwell, founder of the Moral
Majority. He compared Robertson to ``union bosses who have
subordinated the interests of working families to their own
ambitions,'' and he accused both men of attempting to distort his
anti-abortion position and ``smear the reputations of my
supporters.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Political intolerance by any political party is neither a
Judeo-Christian nor an American value,'' McCain said during a
somber address to some 4,000 people who packed a high school gym
only 30 miles from the headquarters of the Christian Coalition.
</P>
<P>
   ``The politics of division and slander are not our values. They
are corrupting influences on religion and politics and those who
practice them in the name of religion or in the name of the
Republican Party or in the name of America shame our faith, our
party and our country.
</P>
<P>
   ``Neither party,'' he added, ``should be defined by pandering to
the outer reaches of American politics and the agents of
intolerance, whether they be Louis Farrakhan or Al Sharpton on the
left, or Pat Robertson and Jerry Falwell on the right.''
</P>
<P>
   During his address, and again in interviews with reporters,
McCain repeatedly framed his speech not as an attack on the
Christian right, but as an appeal to religious conservatives to
join him in condemning political tactics pursued by Robertson and
Falwell on behalf of his main rival, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   As he has for weeks, McCain on Monday accused Robertson of
slandering his national campaign co-chairman, Warren Rudman, by
calling him a ``vicious bigot'' in telephone calls to voters, and
he also suggested that leaders of the religious right may have been
behind other calls and e-mails to voters accusing him of fathering
children out of wedlock and pointing out that he and his wife,
Cindy, have adopted a black daughter.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I'm really absolutely confident of,'' he told reporters
on his campaign bus, ``is that we will reach out to people who
identify themselves with this part of our party to reject the
practices of a few self-appointed leaders.''
</P>
<P>
   But McCain's speech served several other political purposes as
well. While it may cost him votes among members of the religious
right in this state, his aides were counting on the resulting media
coverage to attract legions of more moderate voters in New York,
Ohio and California _ states that figure far more prominently in
McCain's overall strategy for winning the Republican nomination.
</P>
<P>
   According to McCain's aides, the speech also was intended to
reemphasize Bush's avid support from Christian conservatives one
day after he expressed regret for an address he gave at Bob Jones
University, a bastion of the religious right in South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   More broadly, McCain described his speech as part of an effort
to redefine the Republican Party itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are the party of Ronald Reagan not Pat Robertson,'' he
said. ``We are the party of Theodore Roosevelt, not the party of
special interests. We are the party of Abraham Lincoln, not Bob
Jones. Join us. Join us.''
</P>
<P>
   As he concluded, the crowd, half of which were high school
students, stood and applauded enthusiastically.

<TEXT>
<P>
   I'm a mystery woman. Let me rephrase that: I'm a woman who loves
a mystery.
</P>
<P>
   Paperback sleuth stories? I use them up faster than Hercule
Poirot uses up mustache wax. TV lawyer shows with unexpected
twists? I've got a regular Wednesday night date with Lennie Briscoe
and ``Law &AMP; Order.'' Big-screen thrillers? I'm there before you can
say whodunit.
</P>
<P>
   So I speak from a position of some experience when I say that
one of the best suspense movies ever made is about to hit movie
theaters _ again.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rear Window,'' a diamond in Alfred Hitchcock's gem case and my
personal, all-time, latte-mug-runneth-over favorite movie, was
re-released to movie theaters in a restored version over the
weekend.
</P>
<P>
   What makes this 1954 film so special?
</P>
<P>
   First, the cacophony of city life. The story takes place in an
apartment building in Greenwich Village where a photojournalist is
confined to his home by a cast the length of his leg. Having
planted himself beside a window overlooking the building's
courtyard _ the rear window _ the bored and cranky ``Jeff'' passes
his days by watching his neighbors. The camera spins 'round the
building: There's the frustrated composer, the dancer, the
quarreling couple, the newlyweds, Miss Lonely Heart. We see their
stories as Jeff sees them, peeking through their windows, sneaking
into their lives. Music spills into the courtyard, as does a little
dog.
</P>
<P>
   The mystery itself is small. No tale of international intrigue,
just an ordinary little murder. But the suspense in the final third
of the movie is as hold-your-breath thrilling as any of Hitchcock's
best, with the photographer's inability to move out of harm's way
adding to the feeling of terror.
</P>
<P>
   There's a top-notch cast. Jimmy Stewart as Jeff is smart,
intensely restless and just a bit dark in his obsession with his
neighbors' business.
</P>
<P>
   Raymond Burr, a friend of mine from old ``Perry Mason'' shows
(did I mention that I like mysteries?), is a surly villain. Thelma
Ritter's wry nurse adds a dose of humor.
</P>
<P>
   And then there's ice princess Grace Kelly at her elegant best.
Though I could picture other actors in Stewart's role, it's hard to
imagine any other actress bringing such supreme confidence to the
role of Stewart's society girl/model girlfriend, Lisa, who gamely
jumps into the fray. What woman wouldn't secretly want to be Lisa?
</P>
<P>
   So what does all this add up to? Let's just say it's no mystery
where I was Saturday night.
</P>

PERSONAL HEALTH: LINKING ALLERGY, ASTHMA AND INFANT DIETS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN.: Calif., Ariz.)   (The Science Times)  
(jt) 
 By JANE E. BRODY    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Allergies and asthma in children are on the rise in
industrialized countries and medical scientists are searching for
ways to stem this mysterious trend.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors had long assumed that exclusive breast-feeding for at
least the first six months of life and delaying the introduction of
allergenic foods like peanuts, cow's milk and eggs was the best way
to stave off allergies. But several new studies indicate that there
are limits to the long-term effectiveness of this approach for
babies most at risk for developing allergies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Breast-feeding is still good, still the best way to feed a
baby, but if the parents are highly allergic, the baby can still
get allergies,'' said Dr. Yalamanchi K. Rao, a pediatric allergist
affiliated with New York-Methodist Hospital in Brooklyn. ``Mothers
who breast-feed should not be made to feel guilty because their
babies developed allergies.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, he and other experts believe that breast-feeding along
with other protective measures can at least postpone if not prevent
the emergence of an inherited allergic tendency.
</P>
<P>
   No one disputes the value of breast-feeding to a child's health.
In a study of 545 infants published in January 1998 in The British
Medical Journal, Scottish researchers found that those who were
exclusively breast-fed for at least 15 weeks had about half the
risk of getting respiratory infections in the first seven years of
life than did children nursed for shorter periods or not at all.
</P>
<P>
   But a different and more complicated picture emerged regarding
allergy protection. There are a slew of contradictory findings. For
example, a 17-year study of 236 infants in Finland found that
eczema and food and respiratory allergies were significantly
reduced in children who were breast-fed for more than six months.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, last fall a research team from the Arizona
Health Sciences Center in Tucson found in a study of 664 children
followed from birth to age 11 that the allergy-preventing benefits
of breast-feeding depended upon the allergic status of their
mothers.
</P>
<P>
   Among the children whose mothers had low levels of
allergen-provoked antibodies, prolonged breast-feeding was
associated with low allergic responses at ages 6 and 11. But among
the children whose mothers were most allergic, breast-feeding for
four months or longer resulted in more allergic reactions than
shorter periods of breast-feeding or no breast-feeding at all.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Tucson researchers suggested a number of possible
explanations, no one yet knows the real reason. One possibility for
which there is some evidence is that one of the main benefits of
breast-feeding _ its ability to protect babies against infections _
may indirectly increase allergic tendencies.
</P>
<P>
   Under the best of circumstances, a balance develops in babies
between two kinds of immune-response cells, Th1 , which helps to
fight off infections, and Th2 , which sets off an allergic response
to innocent proteins. When babies are challenged by infectious
organisms, as most babies are in the developing world, the Th1
response is primed and predominates over Th2. But when babies are
protected against infection by a semisterile diet, the Th2 system
may have an opportunity to flourish.
</P>
<P>
   A study of 480 air force cadets in Italy, published in February
in The British Medical Journal, lends support to this explanation.
The researchers found that respiratory allergies were less frequent
in the cadets who had been heavily exposed to infectious organisms
transmitted through foods and water. They suggested that ``hygiene
and a Westernized semisterile diet'' might foster allergies by
changing the pattern of normal and pathogenic organisms in the gut,
``thus contributing to the epidemic of allergic asthma and rhinitis
in developed countries.''
</P>
<P>
   What, then, is a mother to do? For starters, whenever possible,
babies should be fed the colostrum produced by the breast right
after childbirth before the mother's milk comes in. Colostrum is
rich in a substance called transforming growth factor-beta
(TGF-beta) that induces tolerance to substances in foods that might
otherwise provoke an allergic response, like eczema, in the infant.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, TGF-beta fosters maturation of the babies' gut,
which would also promote tolerance and prevent food allergies later
in childhood.
</P>
<P>
   The extent of further protective measures should be based on a
baby's risk of developing allergies. If neither parent has
allergies, their offspring have a 10 percent chance of developing
allergies. If one parent is allergic, the risk rises to about 20
percent to 30 percent. And if both parents are allergic, their
children have a 40 percent to 70 percent chance of also developing
allergies.
</P>
<P>
   A study by Dr. Robert S. Zeiger, chief of allergy at the Kaiser
Permanente Medical Center in San Diego, among infants at high risk
of developing allergies showed that those who were given no cow's
milk, eggs and peanuts during infancy and whose mothers also
avoided those foods while breast-feeding developed fewer food
allergies and less eczema in the first two years of life. Other
potentially allergenic foods that might be avoided by both the
infant and nursing mother include fish and shellfish, soy milk,
chocolate, strawberries and tree nuts. However, before giving
birth, it is no longer considered necessary for a woman to avoid
such foods if she is planning to breast- feed.
</P>
<P>
   Rao urges allergic mothers who intend to breast-feed their
babies to insist that the babies not be given any formula in the
hospital, a practice that is common when the mother is asleep at
feeding time. Even one or two bottles of a cow's milk formula may
be enough to sensitize a newborn infant and cause an allergic
reaction.
</P>
<P>
   If a nursing mother trying to curb allergies in her baby is not
going to be around for a feeding, she should pump breast milk and
store it to be fed to the baby while she is away. Alternatively,
the baby can be given a hypoallergenic formula _ Nutramigen or
Alimentum _ in which the cow's milk proteins have been broken down
to a point where they would not provoke an allergic response.
</P>
<P>
   No solid foods should be given to the baby before 6 months of
age, and then foods should be introduced one at a time, starting
with rice cereal prepared with water, then vegetables, then fruit
(with citrus fruits last). Peanuts and egg whites should not be
given before one year of age. The yolk is OK if the egg is first
hard-boiled and the yolk removed free of any contaminating white.
Make sure to avoid feeding prepared foods, like ice cream and
cookies, that are made with whole eggs or egg whites.
</P>
<P>
   To reduce the risk of respiratory allergies, smoking should not
be allowed anywhere in the baby's environment, a Hepa air filter
should be used in the baby's room, the crib mattress should be
enclosed in an allergen-proof cover, no stuffed animals should be
in the baby's room and no furry or feathery pets should be in the
baby's home. Adults who regularly care for the baby should avoid
handling allergenic pets. And the baby's clothes and bedding should
be washed with a mild, unscented detergent like Arm &AMP; Hammer and
rinsed twice.

IS POPULAR DIET POWDER WORTH ITS WEIGHT IN CLAIMS?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Just a tablespoon a day melts the fat away,
claim radio personalities offering testimonials for BodyShaper, the
weight-loss supplement currently taking the country by storm.
</P>
<P>
   On-air testimonials by radio personalities like KRLD/1080 AM's
Kate Delaney, ``the Sports Princess,'' and WBAP/820 AM's Hal Jay
are firing the sales of ``BodyShaper,'' a nutritional weight-loss
product distributed by Mark Nutritionals out of San Antonio.
BodyShaper helps you lose weight while you sleep, without
exercising or dieting, say on-air personalities from at least five
area stations, who say they've been losing weight using the product
in recent months.
</P>
<P>
   But not everyone is convinced that BodyShaper is such a good
idea.
</P>
<P>
   It's ``just a ridiculous scam,'' says Dr. Tim Gorski, an
Arlington obstetrician/gynecologist who serves as chairman of the
Dallas-Fort Worth Council Against Health Fraud and writes a monthly
column on medical misconceptions and deceptions for Tarrant County
Physician, official journal of the Tarrant County Medical Society.
</P>
<P>
   BodyShaper contains collagen, aloe vera and conjugated linoleic
acid (CLA, a mixture of polyunsaturated fats, also known as
``essential fatty acids''), according to Mark Nutritionals. It is
not a laxative, not a diuretic, and does not contain any form of
ephedrin to speed up metabolism, the company says.
</P>
<P>
   It contains nothing that can actually contribute to weight loss,
Gorski counters.
</P>
<P>
   ``It probably does `work,' but only because of the very specific
instructions that it is to be taken on an empty stomach, at
bedtime, no less than three hours after eating,'' Gorski says.
</P>
<P>
   The BodyShaper ``system'' requires that you take one tablespoon
of the pleasant-tasting, fruit-flavored supplement on an empty
stomach, at least three hours after eating, right before going to
bed. Nothing else except water is permitted during that time, and
additional water is recommended throughout the day.
</P>
<P>
   Gorski says he always tells patients trying to lose weight to
drink more water throughout the day and not to eat late at night,
but he doesn't charge them $48 a month for one tablespoon of
supplement per day.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's just outrageous. A glass of skim milk taken at bedtime
on an empty stomach would work as well and maybe even better than
BodyShaper,'' Gorski says.
</P>
<P>
   One month's supply (15 fluid ounces) costs $60, except for radio
listeners who are offered a $48 special.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Nutritionals also sells Atomic Energy, a stimulant to speed
up metabolism ($48 for a month's supply), Maximum Nutrition, a
combination of vitamins, minerals and nutritional herbs ($30), and
The Clicker activity counter to help people monitor how much
exercise they are getting throughout the day ($39.95 for one or $50
for two).
</P>
<P>
   Promoters say BodyShaper is ``a natural product that does not
stimulate, starve or trick the body into weight loss.'' They do not
deny the benefits of exercise, but they say the BodyShaper system
works even without it.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Nutritionals now has 60 full-time employees taking phone
orders, one of those employees said. She says she takes an average
of 300 calls a day.
</P>
<P>
   Telephone sales are fueled by radio ``testimonials,'' not
advertisements, she says.
</P>
<P>
   ``We recommend eating a healthy diet and getting exercise, but
if you can't exercise, it works anyway. I just got off the phone
with a woman from Fort Worth who has MS and can't exercise. We're
not telling people not to exercise. It's good if you can, but some
can't, and this works to help them lose weight anyway.''

Republicans'' from the party. McCain singled out for criticism two
of the Christian right's best-known leaders, Pat Robertson, the
founder of the Christian Coalition, and the Reverend Jerry Falwell,
founder of the Moral Majority. He compared Robertson to ``union
bosses who have subordinated the interests of working families to
their own ambitions,'' and he accused both men of attempting to
distort his pro-life position and ``smear the reputations of my
supporters.'' By David Barstow.

TURKEY RELEASES PRO-KURDISH MAYORS  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By STEPHEN KINZER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ISTANBUL, Turkey _ Mayors of three mostly Kurdish cities in
southeastern Turkey were released on bail on Monday after more than
a week of imprisonment.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of jubilant Kurds turned out to welcome them as they
emerged from a high-security prison in Diyarbakir, the largest city
in the southeast. Police officers restrained them with riot batons
and rifle butts as they cheered and threw flowers.
</P>
<P>
   The three mayors belong to the pro-Kurdish People's Democracy
Party. Their arrest provoked widespread anger among Kurds in
southeastern Turkey, and especially in Diyarbakir, Siirt and
Bingol, the three cities where they had been elected with large
majorities. Scores of people were arrested and beaten in those
cities when they sought to protest.
</P>
<P>
   Several foreign governments also protested the arrests. The
State Department's chief human rights officer, Harold Koh, called
them ``deeply puzzling and deeply disturbing,'' and the European
Union delivered an official letter of concern.
</P>
<P>
   Many Turkish commentators said the arrests had seriously damaged
the country's image and its prospects for moving toward membership
in the European Union. On Friday, Foreign Minister Ismail Cem told
a parliamentary committee: ``The issue will become serious if
things go on this way.''
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Feridun Celik of Diyarbakir, the most prominent of the
released mayors, waved to the crowd on Monday and shouted ``Justice
has been served!''
</P>
<P>
   ``Our struggle for peace and democracy will continue,'' Celik
vowed at a news conference. ``If throwing us in prison will serve
peace, then we will serve 10 years.''
</P>
<P>
   The government evidently plans to prosecute the mayors, but has
not listed the charges. According to press reports, they are
accused of ``assisting and sheltering the terrorist organization''
by meeting with a Kurdish rebel leader, Murat Karayilan, during a
visit to the Netherlands last year.
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone interview published by an Istanbul newspaper that
sympathizes with Kurdish causes, Karayilan denied having any
contact with the mayors. He warned that arresting Kurdish
politicians could lead to a resumption of the now-dormant civil
war.
</P>
<P>
   ``They should not point us back to the mountains,'' he said.
``We say, `Let's solve this by democratic means.'''
</P>
<P>
   Greece, which has traditionally supported Kurdish causes, was
among the first countries to welcome the mayors' release. ``It is a
positive step,'' said Dimitris Reppas, a spokesman for the Greek
government, ``even though it has resulted from international
pressure on Turkey.''
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for the mayors and politicians who support Kurdish
nationalism said they knew of no substantial evidence against their
clients, and urged that the charges against them be dropped.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our friends were arrested, charged and oppressed without good
reason,'' said Ahmet Turan Demir, the chairman of People's
Democracy. ``Their release overcomes part of their suffering, but
of course more needs to be done.''
</P>
<P>
   ``No one wants a return to the past,'' Demir said. ``No one will
benefit from it. The problems of the past will reappear.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Last week, Demir outraged the political establishment by
suggesting that Kurdish rebels, most of whom have stopped fighting,
should be allowed to form a political party.
</P>
<P>
   Sevket Bulent Yahnici, a vice-chairman of the right-wing
Nationalist Action Party, which is part of the governing coalition,
called that proposal ``a form of treason.'' He said rebels or
former rebels were terrorists who ``can never be the interlocutor
for any demands on any subject made by our citizens in southeast
Turkey.''
</P>
<P>
   The State Department's annual human rights report, which was
issued in Washington on Friday, asserted that the Turkish
government ``has long denied the Kurdish population, located
largely in the southeast, basic political, cultural and linguistic
rights.''

 &HT;     McCAIN GAINS ON BUSH IN CALIFORNIA PRIMARY  
 &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By ROBERT SALLADAY  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Texas Gov. George W. Bush retains his
comfortable lead over Sen. John McCain in the California primary
jackpot, but a new survey shows the Arizona senator is gaining more
Republican converts as the two presidential hopefuls fight for the
soul of their party.
</P>
<P>
   The poll also showed Vice President Al Gore maintaining a
commanding lead over former New Jersey Sen. Bill Bradley in the
Democratic primary. Bradley's message that Gore is too conservative
apparently has not impressed increasingly wealthy and older
California voters.
</P>
<P>
   The survey was conducted for the San Francisco Examiner and
KTVU-TV by the Research 2000 polling organization in Rockville, Md.
Both the Democratic and Republican primaries are March 7.
</P>
<P>
   Although he has made big gains in California, McCain's challenge
remains large. The poll showed that Bush, who is supported by most
of the GOP's upper echelon, still leads McCain among all voters
and, crucially, would beat him by an 11-point margin among
rank-and-file Republicans. Although Democrats and independents can
vote for a Republican in California's primary, registered
Republicans are the only ones who count in selecting delegates to
the national convention this summer in Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   But McCain is gaining ground. In an Examiner/KTVU poll taken
last month, he had only 16 percent of the Republican vote compared
with 49 percent for Bush, with 24 percent undecided. Now, according
to the new poll, McCain has nearly doubled his Republican base and
doubled his support among all California voters surveyed,
independents and Democrats included.
</P>
<P>
   The numbers show California could provide this unconventional
campaign with another shocker. Democratic voters who believe Gore
is the sure winner, as the polls show, could defect during the
primary and vote for McCain in large numbers. McCain could win the
beauty contest among all California voters, while Bush could get
the GOP votes and all 162 delegates for the nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Bush supporters and advisers don't buy the split-decision
argument.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a great, fun diversion,'' said state Sen. Jim Brulte,
a Republican from Rancho Cucamonga, ``but I think the one who gets
the most Republican votes is also going to be the one who is the
first vote-getter in California, and I expect that to be George W.
Bush.''
</P>
<P>
   The poll, which has a margin of error of plus or minus 3.5
percentage points, was conducted Feb. 21 through 23 among 803
Californians who say they regularly vote. Among Republican voters
only, the margin of error is 6 percentage points because the sample
size is smaller.
</P>
<P>
   When the poll was taken, McCain was coming off a stinging defeat
in South Carolina, then surging with an important win in Michigan
and Arizona. So the survey results could show an unrealistic
``bounce'' in favor of McCain, said the Research 2000 pollster, Del
Ali.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the poll shows GOP voters statewide are
increasingly split between McCain and Bush, who only weeks ago was
perceived as the anointed nominee. While rank-and-file Republicans
favor Bush by wider margins, McCain is attracting a healthy number
of Democrats and a huge number of independent voters _ the same
scenario that gave him victories in the Michigan and New Hampshire
primaries.
</P>
<P>
   The poll shows that McCain, however, suffers from a gender gap.
Women voters are more likely to pick Bush than McCain if they are
voting for a Republican. Gore does the best among women voters
overall, followed by Bush. Among ethnic groups, McCain doesn't
appear to have suffered from his use of the word ``gook'' to
describe his captors during the Vietnam War. He gets just about the
same amount of support from Asian voters as Bradley and Gore in
one-on-one matchups.
</P>
<P>
   With Republicans only 35 percent of the voting electorate in
California, Bush acknowledges he will have to reach out to
Democrats and others during the general election. But right now his
fight is for Republicans and ``like-minded'' independents, and he
said Democrats might try to ``hijack' the GOP primary by voting for
McCain.
</P>
<P>
   ``My focus is on GOP delegates,'' Bush said. ``If I were
cruising along and winning every primary, it would be one thing.
But I'm in a battle. I've won some and I've lost some. ... There is
going to be ample time to set the tone for the general election
between when the nomination is secure and when people start paying
attention to general election politics.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush spokeswoman Karen Hughes said: ``What has been
disconcerting has been the attempt by partisan Democrats to make
mischief.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain has drawn parallels to his efforts to broaden the
Republican appeal to that of Ronald Reagan, the former president
and California governor.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're putting the Reagan coalition back together,'' said Dan
Schnur, McCain's communications director. ``Independents and swing
Democrats have been crossing over to vote for John McCain because
they want to get the special interests out of government. They've
been hearing his message of reform.''
</P>
<P>
   Part of the Republican fight is over who could beat Gore, the
presumed Democratic nominee, in the November general election. The
Examiner/KTVU poll shows Bush losing to Gore by 7 percentage points
and he is statistically tied with Bradley. McCain is virtually tied
with Gore and beats Bradley by 5 points.

AMATEUR ATHLETES TURN TO PRO TRAINERS 
</HEADLINE>

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   Ed Sher, 38, a St. Louis lawyer, is nothing if not
goal-oriented. A bit of a tennis fanatic, he has his sights set on
winning the Meadowbrook Country Club Tennis Championship in August.
</P>
<P>
   With that goal etched in his mind, he plays several times a week
and also works out with Dale Huff, owner of Nutriformance Personal
Training and Sports Nutrition, a private company in St. Louis, to
give him an edge over his 15 middle-aged peers.
</P>
<P>
   In their hourlong weekly workout, Sher does specific exercises
designed to build strength and increase flexibility to help him
move better on the court and hit the ball harder.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our workout is intense and focused, because if I'm going to do
something I don't want to do it halfway,'' Sher said. ``Rather than
just aimlessly exercise, I do specific exercises to target and
improve the range of motion for movements that are necessary to
play tennis.''
</P>
<P>
   Sports-specific exercise used to be limited to high-stakes,
elite-level competitors. But now growing numbers of recreational
athletes who participate in a wide range of sports are hiring
trainers to help them build specific muscles and hone their
technique to meet more modest goals.
</P>
<P>
   Sports-specific training is a phenomenon that has been
increasing sharply among amateur athletes recently, said Richard
Cotton, chief exercise physiologist for the American Council on
Exercise, a fitness watchdog organization. The council, in San
Diego, recently named sports-specific training as one of its key
fitness trends for 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The trend is particularly striking among golfers. People used to
think that if golfers got too strong, they would lose their touch,
Cotton said. But now it is clear that specific strength exercises
can help them hit the ball farther without sacrificing flexibility
or finesse.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Wayne L. Westcott, co-author of ``Complete Conditioning for
Golf'' (Human Kinetics, 1999), has conducted several studies that
have looked at the effects of exercise conditioning on recreational
golfers. He found that those who participated in an eight-week
program of strength training and stretching targeted to the muscles
and joints used in golf improved their swing and could hit the ball
farther than those who did not.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's especially significant is that we conducted these
studies during the winter months when the participants weren't
playing golf because of the weather,'' said Westcott, who is also
the fitness research director of the South Shore YMCA in Quincy,
Mass. ``The improvements were due almost solely to gains in
strength and flexibility.''
</P>
<P>
   Cotton, himself a weekend golfer, has designed a program to help
him improve his own game. Along with running three times a week, he
also works out regularly with weights and swings a weighted golf
club.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do a full-body weight workout with dumbbells because golf
motions require full-body strength,'' said Cotton, who lives in
Carlsbad, Calif., and plays golf a couple of times a month. ``The
weighted club helps build those muscles like the forearm that are
specific to golf.''
</P>
<P>
   The increased popularity of local running and bicycle races and
triathlons has also helped fuel the sports-specific trend.
Registration is up at running events and triathlons, more events
have been schedules and the variety of events has expanded in
recent years, said Wayne Langan, vice president of RaceDates.com
(www.racedates.com), a Web search calendar for recreational
sporting events.
</P>
<P>
   Jennie Cook, a Los Angeles caterer, plans to compete in three
triathlons and a 100-mile bike race this year. She works with two
trainers, who provide her with specific workouts to help increase
endurance, speed and bicycle technique.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love competition, but the reality is that I'm 40, and I've
got three kids so I really am doing this for fun,'' Cook said.
``But still, I want to do well in these events.''
</P>
<P>
   Tapping into the movement, some health clubs have added
sports-specific training classes, like the Ski and Snowboard
Conditioning Program at Equinox in New York City. Instructors who
teach Spinning, the stationary cycling exercise, even include a
competitive element. Spinning classes prepare participants for race
day, an in-class event that simulates an actual bike race, a kind
of stationary Tour de France, albeit shorter and indoors.
</P>
<P>
   Some people use the classes to prepare for outdoor cycling
competition, while others simply give it their all on race day.
</P>
<P>
   ``Students train specifically for race day and then get a charge
from simulating a real race,'' said Steve Smith, the group fitness
coordinator for C.S. First Boston corporate fitness center in New
York City, which offers Spinning. ``But even though I try to give
them actual race conditions, the competition is really within
themselves. That's what motivates them to come, train and stay in
cardiovascular shape.''

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Clouds and cold winds will persist across eastern Maine on
Tuesday as wet snow tapers off near the Canadian border. Low
pressure east of Sable Island will move slowly into the North
Atlantic. The remainder of the Northeast will be bright, but breezy
and not quite as cool. High pressure crested over the Carolinas
will promote very pleasant weather from the Appalachians to the
central Gulf coast. Abundant sunshine will combine with light
breezes and low humidity to produce a pristine day.
</P>
<P>
   A flow of warmer and more humid air from the western Gulf into
the Mississippi Valley and Great Lakes will trigger showers and a
few thunderstorms in the eastern Plains and the western Lakes.
Gusty breezes from the south will reach 30 mph or more in Oklahoma,
Missouri and Illinois.
</P>
<P>
   Two low-pressure systems will move east in tandem across the
Plains. The stronger disturbance in Manitoba will push a cold front
into Minnesota and eastern Nebraska. The second low, over Kansas,
will drag a front into north Texas and New Mexico. Only slightly
cooler air will follow in the Rockies and northwest Plains.
</P>
<P>
   Fair and seasonable conditions will dominate the Southwest with
high pressure over the Four Corners. A new surge of cool, moist air
from the north Pacific will enter the West Coast from San Francisco
to Seattle, with rain in the lower elevations and decreasing snow
levels in the Cascades and northern Sierra. A gusty cold wind will
be noted at the shore. Clouds and showers will reach the interior
West and parts of southern California at night.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Leap Day Records
</P>
<P>
   February 29, that exceptional calendar date that poses problems
for programmers, also creates conundrums for climatologists. How
special are records set on this date compared to the rest of the
year? Of course, there are fewer occurrences of February 29 than
any other dates. Therefore, the chance of recording an extreme
value is greater than on February 28 or March 1, since the range of
weather conditions recorded for the 29th is less. But, February 29
occurs only once in four years, so the opportunity to rewrite the
record book is reduced by 75 percent compared to other dates.

   &UR; Life After Pollution &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Few structures have come to symbolize environmental decay better
than industrial-size metal smelters. They are often huge, hulking
monsters, belching plumes of pollutants skyward and surrounded by
slag heaps.
</P>
<P>
   So it is nice to know that if a smelter cleans up its act, the
impact can be felt relatively quickly. That is the conclusion of a
study of two species of insect-eating birds near a copper smelter
in southwest Finland.
</P>
<P>
   The study by two Finnish ecologists, reported in the journal
Nature, showed that the birds' breeding success improved over seven
years as emissions of heavy metals were reduced.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier studies of the birds near the smelter had shown that one
species, the pied flycatcher, produced smaller clutches of eggs,
and that both it and the other species, the great tit, produced
fewer live fledglings. The eggshells were thin and porous,
conditions linked to consumption of heavy metals, which found their
way into tree leaves, then into leaf-munching insects, then into
the insect-munching birds.
</P>
<P>
   From 1990 to 1997, pollution controls were instituted at the
smelter, resulting in the reduction of lead and other contaminants
by as much as 95 percent. Over that period, at points within about
a mile of the smelter, the average number of eggs for the
flycatcher increased, as did the average number of fledglings for
both species.
</P>
<P>
   Just as the pollutants had a chain effect, so too, apparently,
did the cleaner air. The scientists suggest that the improved
conditions led to the recovery of local forest vegetation. Better
foliage growth, in turn, aided the recovery of insect populations,
and more insects meant more larvae for the birds to feed their
young.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A Bug's Bug &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Desert locusts are usually loners, but when they get together,
often by the billions, the result can be widespread destruction of
crops. What causes these grasshoppers to swarm, at least in part,
is their sense of smell: they detect pheromones and other compounds
in their feces and in the surrounding air that lead to behavioral
changes, turning solitary insects into gregarious ones.
</P>
<P>
   Now scientists have determined the source of one pheromone
component, and it is an unlikely one. The chemical, guaiacol, is
produced not by the locust itself but by bacteria in its gut. It is
a bug that helps cause the bugs to swarm.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers, from the University of Bath in England, showed
that bacteria were responsible by raising locusts without them in
the laboratory. Analysis of the fecal pellets of these germ-free
insects showed an absence of guaiacol; later experiments, using
locusts with just one species of intestinal bacteria, did produce
the chemical. The studies were reported in the journal Nature.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers noted that the mix of bacteria in the locust's
gut was a relatively simple one, and was acquired from its food.
The adaptation by the insect of the bacterial-produced chemical,
the researchers suggest, has wide implications for understanding
the roles of gut bacteria in insects.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Pickup Up After a Pickup &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Garbage collection is supposed to make a community cleaner, but
a recent University of Florida study has found that this isn't
always the case.
</P>
<P>
   The study, of a 100-home subdivision in Gainesville, Fla.,
showed that on some days, the amount of litter on the streets more
than doubled after garbage trucks came through.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers with the university's Florida Center for Solid and
Hazardous Waste Management said that much of the litter was spilled
when cans were emptied into garbage trucks.
</P>
<P>
   But the researchers also said that homeowners were partly to
blame, overstuffing garbage cans and failing to use bags. And even
e-commerce might play a role _ the researchers noted that one of
the biggest litter problems was those foam peanuts used to pack
goods for shipping.

<P>
   Love did not have a good February, the very home of Valentine's
Day. It was as if Eros took the month off and went slumming.
</P>
<P>
   Few sights are sadder than that of new love, just lit, guttering
out before its flame can come to full glow. Yet, alas, there's no
getting around it: annulment seems the certain future for Rick
Rockwell and Darva Conger.
</P>
<P>
   They're the lovebirds who met and married on national TV in some
fraction of a nanosecond and were whisked away on their honeymoon
before the bride could cry ``Help!''
</P>
<P>
   The occasion was the reliably shabby Fox network's ``Who Wants
to Marry a Multi-Millionaire?'' _ ratings fodder that had 23
million viewers hanging on the outcome.
</P>
<P>
   Fox's sally into family values turned out to have the odd glitch
here and there.
</P>
<P>
   No sooner had Conger dutifully kissed the groom than, as in a
fairy tale run backwards, Prince Charming started turning into a
frog.
</P>
<P>
   Rockwell, it turned out, was a multi-millionaire only if you
scraped everything together, down to the change in his sofa
cushions, and swept his yard with a metal-detector in hopes of
digging up beer cans that would wow the Antiques Roadshow.
</P>
<P>
   Rockwell's movie career consisted entirely of a part in ``Killer
Tomatoes Strike Back,'' the little-awaited sequel to ``Attack of
the Killer Tomatoes.'' According to its web site _ oh, yes, there
is _ the movie is currently unavailable in theaters or on TV. You
can't find it on video and DVD, too.
</P>
<P>
   To boot, spoilsport journalist snoops, cutting sentiment no
slack, not even giving romance a teensy chance, rooted up an old
restraining order that a court had issued against Rockwell to
protect a former girlfriend, a bobble Rockwell sloughed off in his
winning way as the result of a misunderstanding. You know how
ex-girlfriends can be.
</P>
<P>
   And, crucially, the bride sensibly wanted nothing to do with her
pop-up husband. Indeed, when she was picked, Conger looked less
moonstruck than like she'd been poleaxed. Her feelings seemed to go
downhill from there.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Fox's contribution to love consisted only of
inadvertently making the case for chaperoned honeymoons. It was the
first really good press duennas have had in, oh, three or four
centuries.
</P>
<P>
   And no sooner had we romantics resigned ourselves to one love's
sad decline into cross squabbling on morning TV shows than further
disillusioning word came. Tonya Harding, the tough little thugette
of figure skating, had been charged in Seattle with beating up her
live-in boyfriend and slugging him in the face with a hubcap. The
boyfriend is now said to have moved out, which would seem prudent.
</P>
<P>
   The court will have the last say, but in the meantime, what we
do know for sure is that the Harding love nest is one that has
hubcaps lying around, which, I suppose, ought to tell us something.
</P>
<P>
   Cupid, come next February, may be tempted to swap his quiver for
a Kalashnikov.

SURFACE OR AIR? THE GREAT DEBATE CONTINUES 
</HEADLINE>
   (Science Times)  
 (af)  
 By WILLIAM K. STEVENS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When the debate over global warming burst into prominence more
than a decade ago, scientists based their assessment that the
earth's temperature was rising on a single set of observations,
those at the planet's surface. Dr. John R. Christy and Dr. Roy W.
Spencer were troubled by that.
</P>
<P>
   Both had been weather observers, and both knew that the surface
temperature readings were subject to multiple kinds of distortion _
including poor placement of thermometers, spotty coverage of some
regions and the heat emitted by the concrete of cities.
</P>
<P>
   So Christy and Spencer, atmospheric scientists at the University
of Alabama in Huntsville and the NASA Marshall Space Flight Center,
respectively, began wondering: could global temperatures be
measured by earth satellite? If so, the problem of distorted data
might be eliminated.
</P>
<P>
   They decided to find out, and discovered that in some ways the
satellite and surface trends roughly matched. Both sets of
measurements found substantial warming over Northern Hemisphere
continents, for instance, and the timing of year-to-year
temperature fluctuations was about the same in both.
</P>
<P>
   But unlike the surface record, the satellites revealed no
underlying warming trend for much of the free atmosphere, up to
about five miles, mainly in the tropics. In fact, the raw numbers
showed a cooling there.
</P>
<P>
   It was this disclosure on which skeptics seized in their efforts
to use the satellite record to cast doubt on the idea of global
warming. Later, the satellite record was adjusted to filter out the
effects of natural, short-term climate fluctuations like the El
Nino phenomenon and temporary cooling produced by sun-blocking haze
from volcanic eruptions. Later still, the record was corrected to
eliminate distortions caused by the movements of the satellites.
</P>
<P>
   Now the satellite record showed a slight warming, but one much
smaller than the apparent surface warming.
</P>
<P>
   Other analysts had for some time been examining the surface
record and trying to eliminate or compensate for some of the
imperfections that had originally concerned Spencer and Christy.
</P>
<P>
   Enter the National Research Council, the research arm of the
National Academy of Sciences. Christy and Spencer were members of
the panel. In January, it published its analysis of the disparity.
</P>
<P>
   It found that the remaining margin of error in the surface
measurements was now probably about one-tenth as large as the
observed trend, and that the surface warming over the 20-year
period of the satellite measurements, from 1979 to 1998, was
``undoubtedly real.''
</P>
<P>
   That warming, it reported, was equal to 2.25 degrees to 3.6
degrees Fahrenheit per century _ ``substantially greater'' than the
surface warming over the preceding century as a whole.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, the study panel found that over the same 20-year
period, the satellite record showed an average global warming rate
in the lower to middle free atmosphere of zero degrees to 1.8
degrees per century.
</P>
<P>
   How real was the discrepancy? The research council's panel of
scientists found that the level of uncertainty inherent in
obtaining and analyzing temperature observations was almost as
large as the disparity, so it was difficult to know.
</P>
<P>
   To the extent the disparity exists, what has caused it? The
panel said this was also unclear. Errors in measurement and
analysis of data could account for some of the difference, the
group said, but concluded that some of the apparent disparity was
probably real.
</P>
<P>
   It noted that surface temperatures and temperatures aloft were
subject to different influences and were often ``decoupled'' from
one another; that is, the surface and the upper air do not
necessarily behave alike. For example, the group said, sun-blocking
haze from volcanic eruptions is believed to cool the upper air more
than the surface. In 1991 there was just such an eruption, the
biggest of the century from a climatic standpoint.
</P>
<P>
   Short-term effects like these should probably wash out over the
long run, the panel said. Therefore, it cautioned, a 20-year
temperature record is ``not necessarily indicative of the long-term
behavior of the climate system.'' (That is true not only of the
satellite record but also of the unusually sharp spike in surface
temperatures over the two decades.)
</P>
<P>
   In fact, said the study panel's chairman, Dr. John Michael
Wallace of the University of Washington in Seattle, weather
balloons confirm the disparity between the surface and the upper
air over the last 20 years, but show an upper-air warming
comparable to that of the surface over a longer period of the last
40 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``The very likely possibility,'' Wallace said, ``is that in the
next decade we might see a different behavior'' than what has been
revealed over the last two decades.
</P>
<P>
   But for now, the great satellite debate remains at least partly
unsettled.

 &HT;    MAGAZINE SURVEY SHEDS LIGHT ON TEENS' VIEWS ON SEX

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Fifty-five percent of American youths aged 15 to 19
have engaged in oral sex, according to a national survey conducted
for seventeen(cq) magazine.
</P>
<P>
   The magazine said the survey, conducted at shopping malls
nationwide, was intended to highlight the misconceptions, lack of
information and social pressures that shape teen attitudes toward
sexual issues. For example:
</P>
<P>
   _ One-third said they are not getting enough information from
their parents on birth control or on the biological and emotional
aspects of sex.
</P>
<P>
   _ Seventy-five percent said they thought sex education should be
taught in schools by the age of 13.
</P>
<P>
   _ Seventy-five percent believed that most teens are having sex,
but only 40 percent of them reported having done so.
</P>
<P>
   When the magazine conducted a similar survey in 1991, it didn't
even mention the topic of oral sex.
</P>
<P>
   The new survey found that half of teens 15 or older did not
think oral sex was ``as big a deal'' as intercourse, and that only
45 percent thought that it ``counted'' as sex. Fifty-five percent
of respondents thought the practice was ``gross.''
</P>
<P>
   Among other findings of the survey:
</P>
<P>
   _ Fifty-four percent said they were not bothered by
homosexuality, compared with 17 percent in the 1991 survey.
</P>
<P>
   _ Nineteen percent of boys said peer pressure was their main
influence for having sex, compared to 9 percent of girls.
</P>
<P>
   The firm that conducted the survey collected 1,105
questionnaires from people aged 13 to 19 at shopping malls
nationwide, and the results were weighted to to represent a
national sample.
</P>
<P>
   More details of the survey results will appear in the April
issue of seventeen magazine.
</P>
<P>
   In response to the survey results, the Kaiser Family Foundation
is teaming up with the magazine to launch a year-long campaign
called SexSmarts. Through articles and surveys in both Seventeen
and on the magazine's Web site (seventeen.com), the campaign will
address topics ranging from sexually transmitted diseases to how to
say no to pressure for sex.

   President Clinton issued an order this month prohibiting federal
agencies from using genetic information in any decision to hire,
promote or dismiss workers. The order protects 2.8 million federal
employees, and Clinton said Congress should pass legislation to
prevent private employers from discriminating against workers on
the same basis. Such legislation has been introduced by Sen. Tom
Daschle, D-S.D., and Rep. Louise M. Slaughter, D-N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   As the possibilities for using genetic tests to help identify
people with increased risk of developing certain diseases grows,
The New York Times has asked two experts in the field to examine
the issue and comment on the need for such safeguards.

MAN GREATLY OVERESTIMATES THE RISK

University in Winston-Salem, N.C.  
 By MARK A. HALL

<TEXT>
<P>
   President Clinton's recent ban on genetic discrimination by
federal agencies is not in response to any widespread practice, or
even any collection of documented cases of agencies' misuse of
genetic information.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the executive order responds to growing, and somewhat
unfounded, fears about the potential misuse of genetics. The main
purpose of this order is to calm public fears to spur development
of genetic technologies and to help genetic researchers recruit
study subjects.
</P>
<P>
   These are worthy goals, but they reveal that this is mostly a
hortatory, not a regulatory, order. In addition to reassuring the
public, the ban on federal agencies is meant to promote a social
norm that private employers will emulate.
</P>
<P>
   Many laws have important symbolic features that shape attitudes.
Fashioning laws for this purpose can be good public policy. The
social impact of genetics is an arena well suited for such
techniques. But symbolic laws can also be poorly designed,
ineffective or have unintended consequences.
</P>
<P>
   Consider similar state laws that bar health insurers from using
genetic information to set rates or determine coverage. My
systematic study of these laws and of industry practices found the
laws are indeed effective in discouraging health insurers from
considering genetic test results.
</P>
<P>
   Even in states without such laws, health insurers have little or
no interest in using predictive genetic information, out of a sense
that this is wrong and legally problematic.
</P>
<P>
   But state health insurance laws have not been effective in
reassuring the public. Patients, geneticists and genetic counselors
greatly overestimate the risk of discrimination by health insurers.
I suspect the same is true for discrimination by employers.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, people heavily involved in genetics
underestimate the effectiveness of the state protections, viewing
them as untested and potentially full of loopholes. If anything,
these laws may have worsened the situation by conveying the false
impression that a real problem exists.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, a recent study of the Minnesota law limiting
employers' use of genetic information found that it had no effect
and was poorly understood.
</P>
<P>
   One can only hope that a prominent presidential order will be
more effective. But even if it is, symbolic laws can impose a cost
if they fail to take accurate aim at misuses of genetic information
or to block potentially beneficial uses. This is especially
difficult to do when the law is enacted in advance of any actual
experience.
</P>
<P>
   On first reading, the executive order successfully distinguishes
between good and bad uses of genetics. It clearly bars using
genetic information simply to exclude workers who will have high
health insurance costs. But it allows testing to monitor the
effects of workplace hazards.
</P>
<P>
   With respect to worker qualifications, the order charts a middle
course. It allows federal agencies to consider genetic information
that helps to diagnose an existing condition that might hamper
``essential functions of the position.'' But the order prevents
federal agencies from considering genetic information that is
merely predictive of future conditions or problems.
</P>
<P>
   This compromise may not be as successful as it first appears.
First, with respect to workplace safety, there are two important
uses of genetic technology: screening for susceptibility to toxic
exposure, and monitoring the progressive effects of toxic exposure.
The president's order, for no apparent purpose, allows only the
latter, not the former, at least according to my reading.
</P>
<P>
   For example, if the Nuclear Regulatory Commission were subject
to the new order, which it is not now, it could check whether its
inspectors had suffered chromosomal damage from radiation exposure,
but the commission could not screen inspectors for genetic
susceptibility to radiation-induced cancer.
</P>
<P>
   The order has a second potential flaw. It is easy to imagine
situations in which it may be important for an employer to consider
genetic predisposition to future conditions that affect job
performance. Consider, for instance, a hypothetical genetic marker
that strongly predicts sudden, fatal heart attacks. The executive
order would bar using such information to evaluate a candidate for
an air traffic controller's job.
</P>
<P>
   But the order does not bar other, less accurate ways to assess
the same risk. Thus, if the same gene were loosely associated with
another characteristic _ say, premature male balding _ the Federal
Aviation Administration might be tempted to hire younger men only
if they were fully coifed. (This isn't as silly as it seems. Recent
evidence points to statistical association between some types of
heart disease and certain forms of balding.)
</P>
<P>
   The result would be merely to shift the focus of
``discrimination'' to a less accurate, and therefore more
invidious, characteristic. Allowing employers to consider genetic
information might create job opportunities that otherwise would not
exist for some qualified applicants and could conceivably more
accurately bar jobs only to those who were truly risks to public
safety.
</P>
<P>
   Admittedly, this is a far-fetched hypothetical. But one is
forced into such speculations for the very reason that currently
available genetic information has so little actual relevance to
employment decisions.
</P>
<P>
   For now, these potential deficiencies in the order are largely
moot. But, when it becomes more relevant, its hortatory and
regulatory features may come into conflict.
</P>
<P>
   The more finely crafted a law or order is, the more potential
there is for actual or perceived loopholes, and, therefore, the
less protective it will appear to the public.
</P>
<P>
   But making a measure more sweeping will tend to bring its
positive and negative effects into conflict. This uncertainty
should not prevent us from trying, however. It should only caution
us that symbolic laws are not be taken lightly. They too need to be
crafted and monitored with care.

Counselors.

<TEXT>
<P>
   President Clinton's executive order on genetic discrimination is
a significant step toward ensuring that advances in genetics will
be to the benefit, not to the detriment of individuals in society.
To quote President Clinton: ``My goal is to set an example and pose
a challenge for every employer in America, because I believe no
employer should ever review your genetic records along with your
resume.''
</P>
<P>
   Every one of us is at risk for having a condition that has an
underlying genetic component. Advances in genetic testing will
eventually make it possible to offer a number of predictive tests
to determine what we actually are at risk for developing.
</P>
<P>
   Genetic tests have been available for years but have been
limited primarily to newborn and prenatal screening, to carrier
testing for genetic conditions common in certain ethnic groups
(like Tay-Sachs disease in Jews and sickle cell in blacks) and to
tests applicable to those families with known genetic conditions.
</P>
<P>
   But with the rapid advances that are being made in the Human
Genome Project, genetic testing may become available for common
conditions like cancer, heart disease and diabetes.
</P>
<P>
   Such advances in genetic testing hold great promise for
surveillance and preventive treatments, yet also hold the potential
for stigmatization and discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   There are important ways that genetic tests differ from standard
medical tests, in that genetic tests can have significant
implications for other family members and also can identify
conditions for which a person might not develop symptoms for years.
Now, predictive tests are available for hereditary neurological
conditions like Huntington's disease, hereditary cancers and other
genetic conditions.
</P>
<P>
   In general, these are dominantly inherited conditions with onset
in adulthood; each child of an affected parent has a 50 percent
chance of inheriting the genetic alteration.
</P>
<P>
   People often express concerns about how a present or future
genetic condition will affect their insurability and to a lesser
extent, their employability. Take the typical case of a woman in
her 30s who had a predictive test that was positive for
Huntington's disease. She felt she had little choice but to remain
at the same job. She voiced concerns similar to those expressed by
others with positive results: that this information could affect
their ability to be hired and to obtain insurance coverage.
</P>
<P>
   To date, reports of genetic discrimination have been anecdotal,
with few studies conducted to assess the incidence, largely because
genetic testing has been available only to a small group and
because of the difficulty in documenting discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   One 1996 study by a group known as the Genetic Alliance, which
represents more than 300 support groups, and by Georgetown
University found that about 13 percent of 332 support group
respondents reported that they or relatives had been denied jobs or
dismissed from them because of genetic conditions in their
families, although the study did not document such claims.
</P>
<P>
   Whether cases of employment discrimination are fully verifiable
or just perceived, the fact is that fear of such discrimination is
already affecting people's decisions to have genetic testing. In
the same study, 9 percent indicated that they or relatives had
declined genetic testing because of fears of genetic
discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   The public's fear about use of genetic information was also
documented in a study released in 1998 by the National Center for
Genome Resources, a nonprofit research organization, which found
that 63 percent of respondents would be inclined not to take
genetic tests if results were accessible to employers or insurers;
respondents included more than 1,000 randomly selected adults who
participated in phone interviews.
</P>
<P>
   People need to be assured that their decisions to seek genetic
information will not affect their employability. Some feel that
existing legislation is sufficient.
</P>
<P>
   While the 1990 Americans With Disabilities Act was interpreted
by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission in 1995 to include
healthy people who carried genetic alterations for developing a
genetic condition in the future, the extent of this protection was
limited and has yet to be tested in court.
</P>
<P>
   It does not prevent employers' access to genetic information and
it means that having a genetic alteration has to be regarded as a
``disability.'' Twenty-three states have passed laws prohibiting
employment discrimination based on genetic information, but the
level of protection varies widely in terms of what constitutes
genetic testing and what information is actually protected.
</P>
<P>
   The president's executive order sends a strong message to
federal agencies and sets a standard that should be adopted by
employers in the private sector. To quote Dr. Francis S. Collins,
director of the National Human Genome Research Institute, the
executive order on genetic discrimination is practicing
``preventive policy making _ to put in place the kind of
protections that the public needs and deserves before we find
ourselves in a needless crisis situation.''

 &HT;    GOP SAYS COLLEGE AID FORMS HAVE FLAWS
 &HT;    360&AMP;add.
 &HT;    By ANDREW MOLLISON
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ House Republicans attacked the Education Department
on Monday for ``persistent, serious problems'' with the form used
by millions of students to apply for federal aid for college.
</P>
<P>
   They said that early applicants for grants and scholarships in
the 2000-1 school year have been plagued by errors in the software
that calculates eligibility, by slow connections to the Web-based
version, and by the awkward wording of a question designed to weed
out some applicants with recent drug-related convictions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Proper field-testing of the form is not happening, and that is
a major concern for us,'' said Rep. Bill Goodling, R-Pa., chairman
of the House Committee on Education and the Workforce.
</P>
<P>
   In an open letter faxed Monday to Education Secretary Richard
Riley, Goodling and three other Republicans gave Riley two weeks to
explain why the aid form ``is not being prepared, distributed and
processed in a more customer-friendly manner.''
</P>
<P>
   Karen Freeman, an Education Department spokeswoman, said all
software fixes were completed by the Jan. 15 deadline. She said she
didn't know of any problems with the Web-based version of the form.
</P>
<P>
   She agreed that the question on drug convictions was confusing.
But, she said, ``There is absolutely no question that we're doing a
better job of processing loans and grants today than we were a year
ago.''
</P>
<P>
   This year, about 10 million people are expected to fill out the
``Free Application for Federal Student Aid,'' or FAFSA form, which
is also used by many private givers to make decisions about
scholarships and loans. About 8.5 million of last year's applicants
received more than $50 billion in federal aid.
</P>
<P>
   The FAFSA form has to be changed each year to keep up with
changes that Congress and the president make in the laws. The
newest version of the form has ballooned to contain 104 questions
and several worksheets.
</P>
<P>
   ``Each year is a learning experience,'' Greg Woods, chief
operating officer of the Education Department's Office of Student
Financial Assistance Programs, said in a recent interview.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans were most concerned about the fact that more
than 100,000 of the first 500,000 applicants for next year's grants
and loans didn't answer a question on drug convictions.
</P>
<P>
   The question was added to the form because a new law states that
under certain conditions some students can and other students
cannot receive federal financial aid within a year or two of
convictions for possessing or selling illegal drugs.
</P>
<P>
   The question reads:
</P>
<P>
   ``28. If you have never been convicted of any drug offense,
enter '1' in the box and go to question 29. A drug-related
conviction does not necessarily make you ineligible for aid; call
1-800-433-3243 or go to http://www.fafsa.ed.gov/q28 to find out how
to fill out this question.''
</P>
<P>
   Calling the toll-free number leads to a voice-mail menu that is
supposed to help the applicant decide whether to write ``1,''
``2,'' or ``3,'' in the box. At the Web site, applicants can
download a worksheet or answer a number of questions on line.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question and the worksheet worked well when we
pilot-tested it with different groups of students,'' Woods said.
``But in the context of the entire form, it was apparently
confusing.''
</P>
<P>
   Goodling said, ``This year's problems are only the most
recent.''
</P>
<P>
   Last November, 3.5 million printed versions of the FAFSA form
contained errors.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, the department's scanning equipment couldn't read more
than one million of the applications.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, a fight over the education budget caused the forms to
be mailed late.

LOVE AS A DISTRACTION THAT GETS IN THE WAY OF ART
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Publication notes at end of review.) 
(nk) 
 By MICHIKO KAKUTANI   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   With her last book, ``The Volcano Lover'' (1992), Susan Sontag,
the onetime high priestess of the avant-garde, demonstrated that
she could set aside modernist theorizing to create an enthralling
historical novel. In retelling the story of the love affair of Lady
Hamilton and Lord Nelson, she managed to write a book that was at
once an old-fashioned romance and an encyclopedic novel of ideas, a
novel whose emotional wisdom and virtuosic story-telling formed a
perfect bookend to the cerebral dazzle of her essays.
</P>
<P>
   Sontag's latest novel, ``In America,'' is another historical
production about a woman caught in a love triangle between her
husband and lover, but it's an altogether more desultory _ and
unsatisfying _ performance. Despite a playful preface that
introduces the author as a postmodernist commentator on the story,
the novel quickly devolves into a banal, flat-footed narrative that
chronicles the characters' exploits through letters, journals and
corny, omniscient voice-overs. ``He was in a dark place,'' Sontag
writes of one character, ``where there were only wounds.''
</P>
<P>
   Though ``In America'' plays with the Jamesian dialectic between
America and Europe, though it reverberates with echoes of
Hawthorne's ``Blithedale Romance'' and George Eliot's
``Middlemarch,'' it turns out to have little in common with those
novels. It turns out to be a thoroughly conventional imitation of a
thoroughly conventional 19th-century novel.
</P>
<P>
   The heroine of ``In America,'' Maryna Zalewsky, we are told, is
``Poland's most celebrated actress''; like Sir William Hamilton in
``The Volcano Lover,'' she is what Sontag once dubbed a ``saturnine
personality'' _ one of those ``fiercely serious'' souls ``condemned
to work'' and possessed of ``a self-conscious and unforgiving
relation to the self.''
</P>
<P>
   Maryna's autocratic bearing and seductive charm make others
``want to please her,'' make them ``feel they would not want to be
anywhere else on earth than here with her, acting out her vision.''
In 1876, when she decides to abandon her acting career in Europe
and start a utopian community in America _ a community devoted to
the purifying simplicities of a communal, rustic life _ her
husband, Bogdan, her suitor, Ryszard, and a group of friends
obediently pack up and follow her across the Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
   It's not long, however, before that dream of building a kind of
Brook Farm (the utopian community satirized by Hawthorne in ``The
Blithedale Romance'') in the desert farmlands of Southern
California flounders over poor finances and internal disputes. And
while Maryna says she will temporarily go back to acting to raise
some money for the farm, Bogdan says he realizes that ``it wasn't a
new life M. wanted, it was a new self'': ``Our community had been
an instrument for that, and now she is bent on returning to the
stage. She will not consider going back to Poland, she says, until
she has shown what she can do before the American public.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, while we are repeatedly told that Maryna _ or Marina,
as she now calls herself _ has ``a great soul,'' that there is
something ``heroic'' about her dedication to her art, she comes
across as a simple narcissist, a chilly careerist who will always
put her work before everything else. She figures that her marriage
to Bogdan _ who is really attracted to men _ has endured because
``he is just circumspect enough that I still feel free'' and she
abruptly breaks off her affair with Ryszard, telling him that this
``a deux thing isn't, can never be that important to me.'' She
needs to be calm to focus on her work, she says; in any case, she
prefers the ``quasi-amorous approval of innumerable, never to be
known or barely known, others'' to the love of a single man.
</P>
<P>
   Although Sontag does a convincing job of depicting Maryna's
restless nature and ``penchant for exertion,'' she too often
resorts to explaining her behavior in terms of tired cliches about
actresses and acting. She has Maryna repeatedly say she does not
know what she is feeling when she is not onstage, and in another
passage writes: ``an actor doesn't need to have an essence.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Perhaps it would be a hindrance for an actor to have an
essence. An actor needs only a mask.''
</P>
<P>
   The men in Maryna's life are curiously coldblooded and opaque as
well. Bogdan is a faceless consort, compliant, indulgent and
faintly patronizing while Ryszard, who is supposed to be madly in
love with Maryna, shrugs off the end of their affair, thinking of
the books he could now write ``with only lesser obsessions to
distract him.''
</P>
<P>
   None of these lapses in characterization would matter so much if
Sontag had employed the sort of confiding, erudite voice she'd used
in ``The Volcano Lover'' (and toys with briefly in the opening
pages of this novel) or if the narrative bristled with the sort of
provocative asides and historical cameos that energized that
earlier novel.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, this writer, who in essay after essay celebrated an art
of complexity and ambiguity, gives us numbingly familiar
comparisons of Europe and America delivered in stark, uninflected
tones. Europe is about the past, about roots and tradition; America
is about the present, about freedom and newness and change. In
Europe, an artist can embody the aspirations of a nation; in
America, an artist is an entertainer with ``eccentric foibles and
extravagant needs.''
</P>
<P>
   America, we're told, is ``where the poor can become rich and
everyone stands equal before the law, where streets are paved with
gold.'' America is ``where the future is being born.'' America is
where ``everything is supposed to be possible.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The American,'' Ryszard declares in a letter, ``is someone who
is always leaving everything behind.''
</P>
<P>
   No doubt Maryna's decision to exchange the rustic simplicities
of her failed utopia for the luxurious life of a cosseted actress
with as few regrets as she expended in her decision to leave Poland
for the United States is supposed to underscore the freedom America
gives people to reinvent themselves. It also points to the theme of
transcendence _ of overcoming cultural and personal history _ that
runs through the author's work. The problem is that the gifted
Sontag has said what she has to say in this novel more persuasively
and with far more nuance and subtlety many times before.

U.S. FOREIGN POLICY, THE DEMOCRATIC WAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By NORMAN LEVINE  
 c.2000 Special for The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; (LAST IN A SERIES OF THREE ARTICLES. ALSO MOVING IN THE ``K''
CATEGORY  &UR; - RESENDING INHERITING-1, INHERITING-2 AND INHERITING-3
FOR THOSE WHO MAY HAVE MISSED THIS SPECIAL PACKAGE. The author
 &UR; examines the Democratic ``Liberal Moralist'' and ``Liberal
Realist''
 &UR; positions in the debate over the direction of American foreign
policy.)
</P>
<P>
   The American people are undergoing an out-of-body experience:
History is repeating itself, and they have been transferred back to
1920 and the battle waged by Woodrow Wilson and Henry Cabot Lodge
over America's entry into the League of Nations.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson wanted both to make the world ``safe for democracy'' and
for the United States to obey the covenant of the League of
Nations, irrespective of national self-interest. His opponent was
Lodge, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, and
although Lodge favored America's entry into the League, he wished
to modify certain articles as a means of preserving U.S. national
self-interest.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson refused to make any concessions and, in 1920, the League
went down to defeat. The conservatives of 2000 are the spiritual
descendants of Lodge, while present-day liberals inherit the legacy
of Wilson.
</P>
<P>
   As a liberal moralist, Clintonian foreign policy is an amalgam
of Wilson, Jimmy Carter's ``universal human rights'' and reaction
against the Vietnam War with its rejection of unilateral action by
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   After initial hesitation in 1993, Clintonian diplomacy shattered
the boundaries of the containment of Communism theory articulated
by George F. Kennan, a foreign-policy expert and diplomat, at the
beginning of the Cold War. Essentially a strategy to halt further
imperialism of the Stalinist empire, containment theory limited the
extension of American power to the Elbe, which, from 1947 to 1990,
was the eastern border of Germany. &QL; 
NATO EXPANSION &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Clintonian foreign policy committed itself to the enlargement of
the horizon of democracy, and Clinton pursued this goal on two
fronts: expansion of NATO in Europe and support of Boris Yeltsin in
Russia. When Clinton embarked on the jihad of making the world safe
for democracy, he not only embraced this aspect of Wilsonism but
capitulated to the arguments of Anthony Lake, his first national
security adviser.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton Doctrine brought Poland, the Czech Republic and
Hungary into NATO. By including these three countries under the
NATO umbrella, the United States committed itself to the defense of
countries it never previously considered within its own sphere of
national self-interest. This enormous broadening of American
guarantees was justified under the principle of missionary
democracy.
</P>
<P>
   In expanding NATO, Clinton broke American implied agreements
with Mikhail Gorbachev. ``A World Transformed,'' written by George
Bush, who was president at the time of the disintegration of the
Soviet Empire in Eastern Europe, and Brent Scowcroft, Bush's
national security adviser, is unequivocal on this point: At no time
did Bush, Scowcroft, or Secretary of State James Baker indicate to
Gorbachev that NATO would be extended eastward to Poland, the Czech
Republic and Hungary after the Soviets voluntarily renounced their
title to these tracts of land.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. policy toward Yeltsin was another case of missionary
democracy. The Clinton administration adamantly supported Yeltsin
on the grounds that he was leading the democratic capitalist
transformation of Russia.
</P>
<P>
   However, Yeltsin's resignation from office and the crowning of
Vladimir Putin as his successor is a serious setback for the
Clinton doctrine. Putin's recent alliance with the Communists
belies the assertion that democracy is functioning in Russia.
</P>
<P>
   According to Lee Hamilton, Democratic loyalist, respected former
chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, and current
director of the Woodrow Wilson Foundation, Putin's recent coalition
with the Communists ``amounts to a defeat for Clinton, for it
strengthens the power of the Communists in the Duma.'' &QL; 
PUSHING MULTILATERALISM &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Another Wilson ideal that the Clinton doctrine continues is that
American diplomacy should unfold within multilateral institutions.
Liberal moralists are suspicious of unilateral actions because they
fear it will give rise to worldwide anti-Americanism.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of the fact that recent ventures in which America
acted under the aegis of the United Nations _ such as in Somalia,
Bosnia-Herzegovina and Kosovo _ all appear to be failures, the
White House still upholds the usefulness of multilateralism. The
Oval Office fears the bully backlash _ that other nations will
express their resentment against the paramountcy of the United
States by opposing American policies.
</P>
<P>
   Another principle of liberal moralism to which the Clinton
doctrine abides is free trade.
</P>
<P>
   Liberal moralism wishes to turn the movement toward economic
globalization to an advantage for the United States, and so Clinton
has devoted much effort to the reduction of tariffs.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton wishes to use trade as a form of social engineering,
because he hopes that free trade will encourage the growth of a
capitalist entrepreneurial class in countries making the transition
out of communism, like China. Borrowing a phrase from his former
economic adviser, Andrea Tyson, Clinton thinks in terms of
``strategic trade,'' or trade with a deeper purpose than just
making a profit.
</P>
<P>
   In its approach to China, the Clinton doctrine combines the
strategic trade and the ``strategic partner'' approaches.
</P>
<P>
   The theory of the strategic partner is to detach China from any
``anti-hegemonist'' bloc alliance. Primarily, this means preventing
the re-creation of the Cold War Sino-Soviet coalition. &QL; 
OVAL OFFICE'S PLAN &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The hook of strategic trade is associated with the universal
human-rights theory of Carter. By its use of strategic trade, the
Oval Office hopes to ensnare President Jiang Zemin into granting
more ``human rights'' to Chinese citizens. The ultimate aim of
trans-Pacific social engineering is to both speed the development
of a commercial middle class in China and to provide these
entrepreneurs with the protective shield of civil liberties.
</P>
<P>
   Conservatives of all camps attack the Clinton doctrine on China
as a contradiction between rewards and punishments.
</P>
<P>
   Reflecting upon the differences that separate Republicans and
Democrats, Democratic loyalist Hamilton told ``The Arizona
Republic,'' ``Republicans are very skeptical of international
organizations, such as the U.N., the World Trade Organization and
the like. Democrats generally support these multilateral
institutions.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a monopolar world in the social and economic
sense. Even though the U.S. is the only superpower in the military
or `hard' sense, it cannot dictate to all nations of the globe in
matters of gender, children, values or culture. In terms of `soft'
power _ education, information and trade, this is a multipolar
world and the U.S. must learn to act in conjunction with
international organizations.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is important to recognize that the most important lever of
diplomatic power has changed from `hard' to `soft' power. To me,
trade is the crucial issue.'' &QL; 
PARTY SPLIT ON POLICIES &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``The Republicans tend to stress military power,'' Hamilton
added. ``I am an unrepentant free-trader because I believe that
unrestricted trade, from which all sides benefit, is the best way
to export the democratic order.''
</P>
<P>
   But policies are divisive ones within the Democratic Party. To
hold the presidency again in November, Democrats desperately need
the support of American labor, and the AFL-CIO has already endorsed
Vice President Al Gore. Nevertheless, a divorce has taken place
between the corporatist and labor wings of the Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   The corporatists favor strategic trade and China's entry into
the World Trade Organization, because they will be the ``winners''
from the globalization of trade, while Big Labor is opposed to
these policies, because they will be the ``losers'' when domestic
wages are repressed. The Seattle meeting of the World Trade
Organization ended in chaos when Big Labor and environmentalists
led street demonstrations demanding environmental protections, an
end to child labor in China and other Asian countries and
improvement of working conditions before any further reduction of
tariffs.
</P>
<P>
   The issues of China and world trade will be hotly debated along
partisan lines when Congress is called on to approve China's entry
into the World Trade Organization in the fall, and they will play a
major role in the November elections.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has already become a victim of the Democratic dependency on
Big Labor. Gore suffers from a split personality: one face as vice
president and the other as party candidate. As vice president, he
speaks in favor of the Clinton doctrine, but as candidate he must
massage the labor unions.
</P>
<P>
   This past week, Gore's divided personality made the front pages
when the AFL-CIO criticized him for placing the reduction of
tariffs before the increase of wages, the growth of labor unions
and the end of sweat shops in Third World countries.
</P>
<P>
   In spite of Gore's problems with the labor unions, he is also a
Liberal Moralist. In the war of words currently waged in opinion
journals, Stephen M. Walt, a professor of international relations
at Harvard University, has acted as the vice president's script
writer. In an article in the March/April issue of ``Foreign
Affairs,'' Walt has written a Democratic response to the Republican
broadsides that were published by ``Foreign Affairs'' in the
previous issue. The vice president's proxy only proved that on
foreign affairs, Gore is a clone of Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Bradley is also a Liberal Moralist and although there are
no significant differences between Gore and Clinton, there are
important divisions between Gore-Clinton and Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   Gore-Clinton favor an increase in the defense budget, but
Bradley advocates a cut in appropriations for the Defense
Department. Bradley would use the money saved from the military
spending for his domestic agenda such as his health and
anti-poverty programs. Bradley is also far more attuned to the
growing gulf between the cyberspace Atlantic world and the

`BULLY BACKLASH' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Liberal realists, particularly professor Michael Mandelbaum of
the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies, agrees
with Clinton-Gore that it is vital to work within multinational
organizations, but he dissents from the Clinton doctrine on the
issue that America should become a global proselytizer for
democracy.
</P>
<P>
   Mandelbaum led the charge against the expansion of NATO because
he feared the ``bully backlash.'' Mandelbaum's essay, ``Foreign
Policy as Social Work,'' appeared in the January/February 1996
issue of ``Foreign Affairs.'' In the essay, he criticized Clinton
for seeking to turn the United States into the messiah of
constitutional government.
</P>
<P>
   Mandelbaum wrote of Clinton and Lake, his first national
security adviser: ``They tried and failed to turn American foreign
policy into a branch of social work.''
</P>
<P>
   Clintonian foreign policy, Mandelbaum and the entire liberal
realist camp argues, has overextended and overtaxed U.S. resources
around the world. The liberal realists oppose intervention in the
internal affairs of other sovereign states, and they reject the
notion that America can play the world's shrink, using the methods
of a social worker to aid the dysfunctional.
</P>
<P>
   No Republican or Democratic candidate in the current campaign
embraces isolationist or protectionist positions. As the new
century dawns, the United States is experiencing instant historical
replay. The First World War is over, the Treaty of Versailles is
written, and America in 2000 must decide whether it will sign the
League of Nations in 1920.
</P>
<P>
   All those who favor close collaboration with international
organizations, forgoing all instances of unilateral intervention,
will vote for Woodrow Wilson. All those who favor the retention of
full American self-interest, the need for unilateral intervention
to further national security, will vote for Lodge. But whatever
your vote, you must face the consequences: If Americans can put
aside their obsession with the marrying-a- multimillionaire
melodrama, they will bear in mind that history is a life-and-death
sentence, that it repeats itself, and the Second World War followed
the First.  &QL;

   Norman Levine was a professor of European history at the
University of Maryland. He is executive director of the Institute
for International Policy, a Phoenix-based think tank. He can be

   COKESUIT-BLACKS _ ATLANTA _ For the first time since the racial
discrimination lawsuit was filed nearly a year ago, black employees
at Coca-Cola are in motion. Up until two weeks ago, most
African-American employees sat on the sidelines while lawyers
battled in court and a few local civil rights leaders expressed
support for the suit. But now, more black employees are getting in
gear, primarily because the massive job cuts under way at Coke has
changed the dynamics of the situation. For laid off
African-American employees, the suit and the job cuts have been
interlocked, forcing them to make a difficult decision. On
Saturday, hundreds of employees are expected to meet at St. Philip
A.M.E. Church in Decatur to discuss what may become a galvanizing
issue as the layoffs and lawsuit play out in the ensuing months.

INHERITING THE WORLD: AMERICAN FOREIGN POLICY AFTER THE COLD WAR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By NORMAN LEVINE  
 c.2000 Special for The Arizona Republic  
 ALSO MOVING IN THE ``K'' CATEGORY 
 RETRANSMITTING INHERITING-1, INHERITING-2 and INHERITING-3 FOR
THOSE WHO MIGHT HAVE MISSED THIS SPECIAL PACKAGE BY NORMAN LEVINE 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the past hundred years, the United States has had three great
debates over foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
   From 1914 to 1917, President Wilson led the country into World
War I to make the globe ``safe for democracy.''
</P>
<P>
   From 1947 to 1949, America mobilized against Soviet communism,
and George F. Kennan devised the ``containment policy.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, as the nation prepares to select its first president of the
21st century, it has entered its third great debate, and the
question, baldly put, is this: Now that we have inherited the
world, how shall we rule it?
</P>
<P>
   What is at stake in the outcome of this debate is nothing less
than the peace and prosperity of all Americans in the coming
century. Fortunately, America is at peace at the moment, but with
the demise of the Soviet Union as the second-greatest superpower,
many areas of instability and threat have surfaced on international
waters. Terrorism, the proliferation of nuclear, chemical and
biological weapons to rogue states such as Iraq, Iran and North
Korea, the rise of Islamic fundamentalism have brought a series of
mortal challenges to America's doorstep. The United States must
redefine its global role once again, for that act of
self-definition is vital to the security of the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Sadly, it is only every four years, at the time of the
presidential election, that Americans come to face these
life-and-death issues for themselves and for their children.
</P>
<P>
   The conditions in which this discussion takes place are uniquely
different from the 1914-17 and 1947-49 periods. Today, because of
its victory over Politburo totalitarianism, the United States
stands alone as the Earth's only superpower.
</P>
<P>
   The Cold War consensus, based on a bipolar standoff between the
United States and the Soviet Union, has imploded, and in the place
of this consensus a bewildering diversity of opinions has emerged
from the Washington foreign policy elites on how to manage Pax
Americana.
</P>
<P>
   These voices can be grouped into four categories, two
conservative and two liberal.
</P>
<P>
   On the right, the two camps are the Conservative Moralists and
the Conservative Realists. On the left, the two camps are the
Liberal Moralists and the Liberal Realists.
</P>
<P>
   The Dupont Circle area in Washington, D.C., is the miracle mile
of the foreign policy research establishment. Within the 20036 ZIP
code, it is only a five-minute walk among the Johns Hopkins School
of Advanced International Studies (Madeleine Albright's alma
mater), the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace and the
American Enterprise Institute. This is contested turf, a brutal
scrimmage line, for this ZIP code is a kind of foreign policy
football field in which Republican and Democratic advocates block
and tackle fiercely.
</P>
<P>
   Dressed Establishment casual, comfortable in a blue woolen
sweater, Robert Kagan, senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for
International Peace, told ``The Arizona Republic'' in January,
``The United States must be more assertive in advancing the
enlargement of democracy around the globe.''
</P>
<P>
   Kagan and fellow conservative Bill Kristol, editor of the
influential journal the ``Weekly Standard,'' coined the phrase
``benevolent American hegemony'' as a flashcard for their views on
U.S. foreign policy. (``Hegemony'' is code for ``we're in
charge.'')
</P>
<P>
   Kagan and Kristol are the leading exponents of what we will call
the school of Conservative Moralists. A deep strain of moralism
runs through their thinking, because they are unflinching in their
belief that democracy should be the universal form of government,
and they do not shy away from the fact that it may be necessary to
intervene in the affairs of other sovereign states if that is
necessary to bring them the American idea of freedom.
</P>
<P>
   A DAPTING WILSON &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Even though Kagan denies it, the Conservative Moralists are
indebted to the idealism of Woodrow Wilson. One part of Wilsonian
thought was to convince the world of the superiority of democracy,
and this is the part that Kagan and Kristol follow. Another part of
Wilson's thought was the belief that national interests should be
sacrificed to a League of Nations, and both Kagan and Kristol
reject this part.
</P>
<P>
   The school of Conservative Realists, whose most distinguished
practitioner is Henry Kissinger, rejects the moralism of Kagan and
Kristol. All the members of the realist school acknowledge that
democracy is the most desirable form of government, but they deny
that the United States has the missionary purpose of converting the
entire planet to democracy. For this camp, the proper end of
American diplomacy is the preservation of national security.
</P>
<P>
   Kissinger and like-minded policymakers are realists in the sense
that they see the world as made up of competing, self-interested
nations. For them, diplomacy is a jungle. In the spirit of Ronald
Reagan, this group is skeptical about international organizations,
although they see their usefulness. They also draw a line in the
sand between internationalism and the preservation of national
sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
   Conservative Realism is a doctrine that favors unilateral action
to defend the national self-interest of the United States. It
doubts the effectiveness of multilateral action _ for example, the
U.N. peacekeeping mission in Bosnia, which is widely acknowledged
to be a failure. The members of this school argue that the
multinational United Nations never has demonstrated its ability to
efficiently carry out its peacekeeping responsibilities.
</P>
<P>
   Straight and elegant, her mind as sharp as a quarterback in a
fourth-and-one-situation, Jeane Kirkpatrick, ambassador to the
United Nations under Ronald Reagan and now a professor at
Georgetown University and senior fellow at the American Enterprise
Institute, disagrees with the Kagan-Kristol School. A strong voice
within the conservative movement, Kirkpatrick doubts that democracy
can be spread through interventionist methods.
</P>
<P>
   REAGAN'S WAY &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Ronald Reagan, whom I admired as a great president,''
Kirkpatrick said, ``understood the sanctity of national
independence. The U.N. is a useful tool. All international
organizations are useful tools. I am not opposed to the U.N. But
one principle that Reagan stood by, and that I stand by, is that
the U.S. must never surrender its sovereignty or national
self-interests to any international organization.''
</P>
<P>
   The foreign policy agenda of the Republican Party is made up of
both Conservative Moralists and Realists. Gov. George W. Bush
himself stands squarely in the faction of Conservative Realism.
Many members of the realist school, including Condoleezza (EDITORS:
CORRECT) Rice, Elliot Abrams, Richard Perle and Paul Wolfowitz
(EDITORS: CORRECT) (all of whom held high foreign policy positions
in either the Reagan or Bush administrations), are currently
advisers to the present Bush presidential campaign. John McCain is
also a Conservative Realist, and one of his foreign policy advisers
is Henry Kissinger. Neither the Conservative Moralists nor Realists
are isolationists.
</P>
<P>
   The liberal Establishment also fields a team within the 20036
ZIP-code playing field, and the expertise of the Brookings
Institute is certainly playoff quality. Although it is primarily a
research center for scholars from all over the world, and as such
its public image must be as objective, the Woodrow Wilson Center,
yards away from the Dupont Circle, currently is headed by Lee
Hamilton, who presented to ``The Republic'' the arguments of the
Liberal Moralists.
</P>
<P>
   A Democrat and former member of Congress, Hamilton was chairman
of the House Foreign Relations Committee. Stately, and possessed of
a typical Hoosier friendliness, Hamilton said, ``The Republicans
are too quick to defend unilateral intervention. Even though
international organizations are imperfect, America must learn to
work in cooperation with them.''
</P>
<P>
   CARTER LEGACY &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The political heritage of the Liberal Moralists grows out of the
unusual alliance among Wilson, Jimmy Carter and Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   From Wilson, the Liberal Moralists take the ideas of the
dissemination of democracy, as well as a commitment to collective
security and internationalism. From Jimmy Carter, they borrow the
dogma of universal human rights, which includes the rights of
women, children and labor.
</P>
<P>
   The war in Vietnam served as a bloody lesson that the arrogant,
unilateral exercise of U.S. power can produce the diplomatic
isolation of the United States. Like the Conservative Moralists,
Liberal Moralists also advocate an expansive role for democracy and
the capitalist system. Unlike both the Conservative Moralists and
Realists, the Liberal Moralists are suspicious of unilateral
intervention as a means of disseminating democracy and human
rights. Liberal Moralists prefer to act within multilateral
institutions, such as the United Nations. For example, Liberal
Moralists favor humanitarian intervention under the umbrella of the
United Nations. The American involvement in Kosovo is presented as
a model of humanitarian intervention, for in this case the United
States became engaged to prevent the continued slaughter of
Kosovars, but under the aegis of the multilateral United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   Recognizing that globalization was one of the dominant
tendencies of the last decade of the 20th century, Liberal
Moralists are free-traders. A large corporatist faction exists
within Liberal Moralists, because multinational corporations see
the opportunity to harvest huge profits from the
internationalization of trade.
</P>
<P>
   Liberal Realists speak the language of national self-interest
and not the tongue of democratic moralism. Like the Conservative
Realists, their brethren the Liberal Realists take a dim view of
the idea that the purpose of American diplomacy is the conversion
of the globe to democracy. They also view the goal of international
relations as the preservation of American nationhood.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike their conservative brethren, however, Liberal Realists
perceive contemporary international relations as multipolar. They
stress the importance of the United States' working in harmony with
multilateral organizations because they see the danger of causing a
reaction against the American imperium. If the United States were
to pursue a unilateralist course of action, the Liberal Realists
argue, this would result in the undesirable development of an
``anti-hegemonist'' camp _ the alliance of Russia, China and Iran
to halt American primacy.
</P>
<P>
   CLINTON OPPOSED &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The most prominent members of the Liberal Realist camp are three
academicians: Professors Michael Mandelbaum and Robert W. Tucker
(emeritus) of the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International
Studies and Professor Ronald Steel of the University of
California-Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   True to their belief that America must show great restraint
before exercising unilateral action, the Liberal Realists opposed
the Clinton policy of NATO expansion. Mandelbaum's book ``The Dawn
of Peace in Europe'' is the classic statement against the need for
NATO enlargement on the grounds that it would drive Russia and
China together. Tucker's book ``The Imperialist Temptation''
criticized President Bush's Operation Desert Storm because it
represented U.S. overreach, extending U.S. responsibilities from
Western Europe, the original site of the American-Soviet standoff,
to the Persian Gulf, a colossal stretch of American national
interests.
</P>
<P>
   Clintonian foreign policy is an outgrowth of Liberal Moralism.
Although there are significant differences in terms of their
foreign policy, both Al Gore and Bill Bradley are members of the
Liberal Moralist wing of the Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   The grand foreign policy debate of the new millennium, the
search for the Second Coming of George F. Kennan, is essentially an
in-house dialogue among inhabitants of the Washington policy think
tanks. During the Kosovo entanglement the American people were
activated by TV war imagery to think about America's role in the
world, but Kosovo is over, and Americans again have turned their
gaze inward. It is Social Security, medical insurance, education
and taxes that consume their interest in this election year and not
``ethnic cleansing.''
</P>
<P>
   As Norman Ornstein, a specialist on Congress at the American
Enterprise Institute, pointed out, ``63 percent of the House of
Representatives were elected after the fall of communism.'' The
amount of money spent on agencies in the U.S. government dealing
with foreign affairs has been cut by Congress. The amount of money
given to international organizations also has been diminished. It
is truly a new world.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not that Congress is isolationist,'' Ornstein suggested,
``it is rather that Congress is insular. Domestic needs have taken
priority.''
</P>
<P>
   Unless there is a terrorist act of great bestiality, unless the
TV screen can show decapitated bodies and mangled limbs, Americans
will elect their first chief executive of the new century on issues
relating to homosexuality and abortion rather than on this
transformative moment of how the U.S. colossus should behave in the
world after it inherited this wondrous sphere.  &QL;

the capitalist system. Unlike both the Conservative Moralists and
Realists, the Liberal Moralists are suspicious of unilateral
intervention as a means of disseminating democracy and human
rights. Liberal Moralists prefer to act within multilateral
institutions, such as the United Nations. For example, Liberal
Moralists favor humanitarian intervention under the umbrella of the
United Nations. The American involvement in Kosovo is presented as
a model of humanitarian intervention, for in this case the United
States became engaged to prevent the continued slaughter of
Kosovars, but under the aegis of the multilateral United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   Recognizing that globalization was one of the dominant
tendencies of the last decade of the 20th century, Liberal
Moralists are free-traders. A large corporatist faction exists
within Liberal Moralists, because multinational corporations see
the opportunity to harvest huge profits from the
internationalization of trade.
</P>
<P>
   Liberal Realists speak the language of national self-interest
and not the tongue of democratic moralism. Like the Conservative
Realists, their brethren the Liberal Realists take a dim view of
the idea that the purpose of American diplomacy is the conversion
of the globe to democracy. They also view the goal of international
relations as the preservation of American nationhood.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike their conservative brethren, however, Liberal Realists
perceive contemporary international relations as multipolar. They
stress the importance of the United States' working in harmony with
multilateral organizations because they see the danger of causing a
reaction against the American imperium. If the United States were
to pursue a unilateralist course of action, the Liberal Realists
argue, this would result in the undesirable development of an
``anti-hegemonist'' camp _ the alliance of Russia, China and Iran
to halt American primacy.
</P>
<P>
   CLINTON OPPOSED &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The most prominent members of the Liberal Realist camp are three
academicians: Professors Michael Mandelbaum and Robert W. Tucker
(emeritus) of the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International
Studies and Professor Ronald Steel of the University of
California-Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   True to their belief that America must show great restraint
before exercising unilateral action, the Liberal Realists opposed
the Clinton policy of NATO expansion. Mandelbaum's book ``The Dawn
of Peace in Europe'' is the classic statement against the need for
NATO enlargement on the grounds that it would drive Russia and
China together. Tucker's book ``The Imperialist Temptation''
criticized President Bush's Operation Desert Storm because it
represented U.S. overreach, extending U.S. responsibilities from
Western Europe, the original site of the American-Soviet standoff,
to the Persian Gulf, a colossal stretch of American national
interests.
</P>
<P>
   Clintonian foreign policy is an outgrowth of Liberal Moralism.
Although there are significant differences in terms of their
foreign policy, both Al Gore and Bill Bradley are members of the
Liberal Moralist wing of the Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   The grand foreign policy debate of the new millennium, the
search for the Second Coming of George F. Kennan, is essentially an
in-house dialogue among inhabitants of the Washington policy think
tanks. During the Kosovo entanglement the American people were
activated by TV war imagery to think about America's role in the
world, but Kosovo is over, and Americans again have turned their
gaze inward. It is Social Security, medical insurance, education
and taxes that consume their interest in this election year and not
``ethnic cleansing.''
</P>
<P>
   As Norman Ornstein, a specialist on Congress at the American
Enterprise Institute, pointed out, ``63 percent of the House of
Representatives were elected after the fall of communism.'' The
amount of money spent on agencies in the U.S. government dealing
with foreign affairs has been cut by Congress. The amount of money
given to international organizations also has been diminished. It
is truly a new world.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not that Congress is isolationist,'' Ornstein suggested,
``it is rather that Congress is insular. Domestic needs have taken
priority.''
</P>
<P>
   Unless there is a terrorist act of great bestiality, unless the
TV screen can show decapitated bodies and mangled limbs, Americans
will elect their first chief executive of the new century on issues
relating to homosexuality and abortion rather than on this
transformative moment of how the U.S. colossus should behave in the
world after it inherited this wondrous sphere.  &QL;

 &HT;    If something doesn't seem right, don't hesitate to consult
another physician.
 &HT;    By Diane Lore
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   When it comes to second opinions in medicine, too many of us are
simply too polite. But such a lack of assertiveness could cost
patients their lives.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, patients should heed their own intuition about their
health and speak up when things simply don't feel right, says Dr.
Jerome Groopman, author of ``Second Opinions: Stories of Intuition
and Choice in the Changing World of Medicine'' (Viking, $24.95).
</P>
<P>
   So why do patients shy away from something that obviously makes
good common sense?
</P>
<P>
   ``Because so many patients still view obtaining a second opinion
as an insult to the doctor,'' says Dr. Michael Andrews, president
of the Georgia Society of Clinical Oncology. ``We try to encourage
second opinions _ we don't take it personally. Because in the end,
it's in the best interest for the patient and for me: The patient
comes back feeling better about everything, and for me, oftentimes,
it puts the patient back on the same page because they are more
confident about what I'm recommending.''
</P>
<P>
   So here's how to become more assertive and get that useful
second opinion:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The little things matter. Dress neatly, even professionally,
for a meeting with your doctor to discuss getting a second opinion.
Be courteous and direct about wanting one, advises Dr. Robert
Schreiner of Kaiser Permanente of Georgia. And always ask for a
referral, even if you don't plan to use it. It shows you respect
your doctor's opinion.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  If your doctor seems petulant or irritated about your request
_ or even refuses to give you a referral _ consumer advocates say
to fire him or her and find another doctor. Most doctors don't mind
patients asking for a second opinion; if yours does, it could
indicate trouble ahead.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  If your insurance won't pay for a second opinion because your
doctor won't approve it _ since managed care plans often require
patients to go through their primary physician before seeking
outside specialists _ find out about the appeal process. Also, ask
for a case manager, suggests Dr. Charles Cutler, chief medical
officer for the American Association of Health Plans. Case managers
are especially helpful because they can coordinate second opinions
from health professionals outside your plan, such as those
affiliated with academic centers that may be far away.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  If you're getting nowhere with your doctor or insurer, contact
your employer's human resources department or the Georgia Insurance
Commissioner's Office. Its consumer hotline number is 404-656-2070.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  And finally, once you get approval for a second opinion, make
sure the second doctor receives copies of all office notes, lab
test results, X-ray films (yes, the actual films) and pathology
slides. Don't depend on doctors' offices to communicate or make
sure this happens.
</P>
<P>
   Interestingly, while consumer advocates have long pushed for
getting second opinions, in the past 20 years the motivation has
changed. At one time, second opinions were urged in order to make
sure recommended operations, such as hysterectomies, were actually
needed _ a result of traditional indemnity insurance plans under
which patients could get any procedure at any time. Today, second
opinions are often recommended to make sure patients are getting
the treatments they need.
</P>
<P>
   Says Dr. Sidney Wolfe, director of the Public Citizen Health
Research Group in Washington: ``Patients need to remember they're
the ones whose bodies are on the line.''
</P>

   ``ROBIN HOOD WAS RIGHT'' &QL; 
By Chuck Collins and Pam Rogers (Norton, $28.95) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Wait! Don't mail those checks yet. Collins and Rogers have
advice about charitable giving that will help you donate your money
with thought and purpose rather than with guilt and self-interest.
Americans gave $109 billion to charity last year, yet one in four
top earners gave nothing, the wealthy gave smaller portions of
their assets than did the poor, and only 13 percent of the money
went to direct public benefit through human service programs (most
went to churches, the arts, elite private universities and
hospitals). Here, the authors attempt to redefine modern
philanthropy in order to affect change _ instead of focusing on the
immediate symptoms of social or economic problems, they want our
dollars to chip away at the CAUSES of those problems. Collins and
Rogers are dedicated, energetic, knowledgeable and frankly, a bit
daunting in their zeal. But you'll learn something if you listen to
them. As Alfre Woodard writes in her preface, ``Robin Hood was
right. And he had a damn good time.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
``HAWKE'S COVE'' &QL; 
By Susan Wilson (Pocket, $23.95) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Here's one for the ``Bridges of Madison County'' crowd, another
novel that attempts to parlay yearning and denial into a bad but
bittersweet bestseller. A young journal-keeping woman named Vangie
retreats to her grandmother's farm in a small coastal town (note
the title) to recover from the death of her baby and to wait for
news of her husband, who is overseas fighting in World War II. It's
not long before a down-on-his-luck stranger named Joe shows up, and
we know what that means. Vangie hires him to work on the farm, they
drink tea and lemonade, they watch each other through lowered
lashes, they swim (``There is,'' Wilson writes, ``a strange
intimacy in swimming . . .''), she spreads ointment on his
blistered hands. When Vangie's husband is declared missing in
action, she and Joe have a hot night together in the hayloft, but
word comes the very next morning that the husband is still alive.
Denial commences. Years pass. Violins play. Their children grow up
and get nosey. Have you been here before? You betcha. &QL; 
 &QL; 
``FOREVER LIESL'' &QL; 
By Charmian Carr (Viking, $23.95) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   We were hoping to find some dirt here, but according to Carr,
there was precious little of it on the set of ``The Sound of
Music.'' Until now, the only relief from the unrelenting sweetness
of the film was an anecdote about Christopher Plummer, who played
Baron von Trapp and who allegedly hated the movie so much he called
it ``The Sound of Mucus.'' But Carr, who played the von Trapp
daughter Liesl, debunks that story, saying that Plummer himself
denies it (he did despise the song ``Edelweiss'' and tried to have
it tossed from the film). Mostly, this book is a cheerful report on
a cheerful experience, with some funny moments on the side. When
she attended the Mexican premiere (the film was called ``La Novicia
Rebelde,'' or ``The Rebellious Novice''), the unsuspecting Carr was
taken to a bullfight. The matador dedicated the bull to her, and
she watched in horror as the bull was tormented by the matador and
the matador was then run over by the bull. She visited the matador
in the hospital, as Liesl certainly would have done if she'd been
there. &QL; 
 &QL; 
``THE VISION OF EMMA BLAU'' &QL; 
By Ursula Hegi (Simon &AMP; Schuster, $25) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Hegi's new novel is a family saga that begins in the early
1900s, when scrappy teenager Stefan Blau comes to America from
Germany (specifically from Burgdorf, which figures into Hegi's
earlier books, ``Stones From the River'' and ``Floating in My
Mother's Palm''), and sets out to make his fortune. After a fire in
the New York restaurant where he works, he leaves the city and goes
to a small town in New Hampshire because a fellow immigrant has
told him it reminded him of Germany. There, Stefan marries twice
and loses both wives to the births of his children before he
returns to Burgdorf to bring back and marry Helene Montag, his
childhood friend and the character through which Hegi explores the
difficult adjustment of the German immigrant. Serving as a backdrop
for the story is the Wasserburg, the grand and glorious apartment
building that Stefan builds, which reflects the fortunes of his
family. Hegi's characterization is superb, part of a story that is
as well-constructed as the Wasserburg itself.  &QL;

&HT;     MOLLY IVINS' NEW BOOK ON GEORGE W. _ A LOOK AT HIS RECORD 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By JOAN SMITH  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   If there is anyone in journalism who can make reading about
politics a rollicking good time, it's Molly Ivins, the nationally
syndicated columnist from Texas. Granted, she has a point of view.
</P>
<P>
   She once referred to former House Speaker Newt Gingrich as a
``political sociopath'' and wrote that ``having [New York Sen.
Alfonse] D'Amato conduct an ethics investigation is like watching
Mike Tyson run a sensitivity training seminar.'' But she is also an
indisputably great reporter. She edited the Texas Observer, was
Rocky Mountain bureau chief for the New York Times, and has worked
for the Houston Chronicle, the Minneapolis Star &AMP; Tribune and the
Dallas Times Herald. Her column for the Fort Worth Star-Telegram is
syndicated to more than 200 newspapers, and she has published
collections of her columns in two hilarious best-selling books _
``Molly Ivins Can't Say That, Can She?'' and ``You Got to Dance
With Them What Brung You: Politics in the Clinton Years.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet Ivins' latest book  &Cx1f; _ a biography of the man from her home
state who hopes to be president _ isn't all that funny. ``Shrub:
The Short but Happy Political Life of George W. Bush'' is ``a
straightforward look at the political record _ no sex, no drugs, no
Freud,'' says Ivins in a recent telephone interview.
</P>
<P>
   Ivins, who invented the botanical moniker for Bush (popularized
by her friend, former Texas Gov. Ann Richards), complains that the
problem with looking at his political record was finding it in the
first place. ``The single, most-common misconception about `Dubya'
(as she calls him) is that he spent the last 5 1/2 years governing
a large state,'' she explains. ``But in Texas we have what is
called a weak-governor system _ it's not much of a job. By
constitutional arrangement, the governor is about the
fifth-most-powerful person in the state.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Ivins and her co-author, Texas Monthly editor Lou Dubose,
committed themselves to guiding us step-by-step through the
governor's remarkably uninspired career. ``Young political
reporters are always told there are three ways to judge a
politician,'' they write. ``The first is to look at the record. The
second is to look at the record. And third, look at the record. So
here we are, with a record about property-tax abatement and tort
reform, and if that's not a by-God recipe for bestsellerdom, you
can cut off our legs and call us Shorty.''
</P>
<P>
   And, in fact, those are the only issues in Texas that ever
really got Bush's administrative juices flowing, according to Ivins
and Dubose.
</P>
<P>
   In a state with the worst environmental problems in the country,
Bush blocked an attempt by his advisers to force 850 industrial
plants responsible for a third of the state's air pollution to
comply with clean-air laws.
</P>
<P>
   In a state with people living along the border in communities so
poor and benighted that they've had to go to the capital of Austin
by the busload just to fight for water and sewage hookups, Bush's
idea of a `legislative emergency' was tort reform _ making it
harder for people to sue big business. Ivins cites a Los Angeles
Times analysis of Bush's spectacular fund-raising success that
shows he raised $4.5 million just from the businesses that
supported Texas tort reform, a ``figure that left us all
whomper-jawed.''
</P>
<P>
   Ivins and Dubose also look at Bush's official biography and come
up with a couple of what you might call little whoppers. They
include his claim during his first congressional race that he was
on active duty during the Vietnam War when he was really skipping
to the top of a waiting list of 100,000 men to join the Texas
National Guard, a feat he still insists he managed (despite
convincing testimony to the contrary) without the help of any of
his father's friends.
</P>
<P>
   And then there is Bush the oilman. ``The governor's oil-field
career can be summed up in a single paragraph,'' write Ivins and
Dubose. ``George W. arrived in Midland in 1977, set up a shell
company, lost a congressional election in 1978, restarted building
the company he'd put on hold, lost more than $2 million of other
people's money, and left Midland with $840,000 in his pocket. If
Bush does make it to the White House, he and Laura should have Ken
Starr over for dinner.''
</P>
<P>
   If Starr hadn't so abused the power of his office, Congress
might have re-authorized the independent-counsel statute. That
could have left the door open for a court-appointed prosecutor to
investigate a president's son who flipped his oil companies faster
than a Texas S&AMP;L can daisy-chain a Dallas condo, and who, as a
corporate board insider, unloaded his stock shortly before its
price plummeted. He walked away from the whole mess with more money
than Bill Clinton ever dreamed of making on a little real estate
deal known as Whitewater.
</P>
<P>
   ``We also took a look at his `compassionate conservatism,'''
says Ivins. ``Looking for the compassion part, we really didn't
find much, though his work on behalf of `big bidness,' as we so
reverently call it in Texas, does give new dimension to the phrase
`corporate welfare.'''
</P>
<P>
   Ivins says she finds the election ``real interesting. I spent a
year and a half arguing with most of my colleagues that there is
nothing inevitable about the nominations of George Bush and Al
Gore, and now it's become conventional wisdom. Not to mention the
fun and frolic over there in the Reform Party. I think it's a
fabulous show.''

 &HT;    Do those supplements work?
 &HT;    By M.A.J. McKenna
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Deciding whether to take nutritional supplements can be
nightmarish. Some offer real benefit; others can be dangerous if
they aggravate an underlying medical problem or cross-react with a
drug you're already taking. Almost all are cleverly packaged and
heavily hyped; relatively few offer scientific evidence for their
presumed effects. (Federal law classifies supplements as foods, not
drugs; that categorization prevents manufacturers from making
medical claims but relieves them of doing the rigorous testing that
pharmaceuticals are subjected to.)
</P>
<P>
   So what's a consumer to do? The answer is to do your own
research. Web sites such as Supplement Watch (www
</P>
<P>
   .supplementwatch.com) are making it easier.
</P>
<P>
   The 2-year-old site, created by a self-described ``small group
of scientists, physiologists, nutritionists and other health
professionals'' in Utah, provides pithy, free and apparently
independent reviews of more than 100 types of supplements and
individual products. Though basically friendly to supplementation,
the reviewers don't hesitate to name names when urging people to
``hold off for now'' or ``don't waste your money.''
</P>
<P>
   Points in the site's favor: It lists citations so you can look
up scientific research, and it has no easy-shopping links to online
pharmacies.
</P>
<P>
   Clouds on the horizon: The site is soliciting advertisers, so
its neutral-seeming presentation may not last.

   Hegi's new novel is a family saga that begins in the early
1900s, when scrappy teenager Stefan Blau comes to America from
Germany (specifically from Burgdorf, which figures into Hegi's
earlier books, ``Stones From the River'' and ``Floating in My
Mother's Palm''), and sets out to make his fortune. After a fire in
the New York restaurant where he works, he leaves the city and goes
to a small town in New Hampshire because a fellow immigrant has
told him it reminded him of Germany. There, Stefan marries twice
and loses both wives to the births of his children before he
returns to Burgdorf to bring back and marry Helene Montag, his
childhood friend and the character through which Hegi explores the
difficult adjustment of the German immigrant. Serving as a backdrop
for the story is the Wasserburg, the grand and glorious apartment
building that Stefan builds, which reflects the fortunes of his
family. Hegi's characterization is superb, part of a story that is
as well-constructed as the Wasserburg itself.  &QL;

 &HT;    Rx for choosing the right path: TRUST YOUR GUT
 &HT;    By M.A.J. McKenna
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   In an increasingly pressured and technological medical world,
Dr. Jerome Groopman makes a practice of tuning out the noise. He
listens instead to a still, small voice: his own intuition and that
of his patients.
</P>
<P>
   A cancer and blood specialist, Groopman holds an endowed
professorship at Harvard Medical School and is chief of
experimental medicine at a Harvard teaching hospital. His
laboratory helped develop drugs that revolutionized the treatment
of HIV and identified two genes linked to breast cancer.
</P>
<P>
   He is, in other words, the epitome of an academic research
scientist. Yet Groopman believes that good medicine makes room for
the unquantifiable input of gut instinct and emotion from both
doctors and patients.
</P>
<P>
   The encounters that result are captured in his new book,
``Second Opinions: Stories of Intuition and Choice in the Changing
World of Medicine'' (Viking, $24.95). In its narratives, Groopman
describes patients he has treated: a wealthy man whose local
doctors fear that if he consults a specialist, their hospital will
lose his patronage; a cleaning woman whose cancer is misdiagnosed
by an overworked clinic doctor; a mother trying to decide between
risking breast cancer, which runs in her family, and having her
breasts removed. Interspersed with these accounts are moments from
Groopman's own experience: as a family member when his grandfather,
father and son were caught in medical crises, and as a bullheaded
back-pain patient ignoring his own doctors' advice.
</P>
<P>
   A thread of argument links the chapters: Groopman's conviction
that the patient's perspective and the physician's instincts are as
important to medical decision-making as clinical guidelines and
research results.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, Groopman spoke with the Journal-Constitution about
encouraging patients _ and doctors _ to trust their intuition and
speak up.
</P>
<P>
   Q: It seems odd to hear a research scientist recommend listening
to intuition.
</P>
<P>
   A: Medicine is certainly a science _ but it's not an exact
science. There is a dimension to medicine that involves the
intersection of information, observation, experience and instinct.
Some of it involves knowing the person whom you're caring for,
understanding their personality and their body language.
</P>
<P>
   When you struggle with a diagnosis or treatment, those elements
_ which are not quantifiable _ have real importance in guiding your
thinking.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Can you think of an example?
</P>
<P>
   A: Sure. I take care of a middle-aged man whose wife died a
number of years ago and who has bone marrow failure; he's anemic. I
took care of him for a number of years during which his transfusion
needs slowly increased, which is typical. Then when I saw him six
months ago, his transfusion needs had really gone up. If I had
looked at him in a strictly scientific way, I would have said,
``Mr. Jones' anemia is worse; he needs more blood.'' But I noticed
he seemed somewhat ill at ease. So I completely left the medical
sphere and asked him about his home life. He had a girlfriend, and
it turned out he was impotent.
</P>
<P>
   Now, testosterone is a key hormone in stimulating red blood cell
production in men, and people with long-term illnesses such as the
one he has can get low testosterone levels. We measured his, and it
was sub-basement. So we gave him testosterone, and it not only
improved his sexual dysfunction, but his transfusion needs
plummeted.
</P>
<P>
   I had a gut feeling that something was changed with him, though
I wasn't sure what it was. And because I know him as a person, and
because he was comfortable with me, I could move into a social
domain and find out something which many men wouldn't disclose.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What about patients whose doctors don't know them well? Can a
doctor exercise intuition within the constraints of managed care?
</P>
<P>
   A: It's certainly one of the negative outcomes of managed care
to have visits that are measured in single-digit minutes. Taking
the extra time, being able to address social and psychological
needs, not only may turn up an important medical fact but also
improves the chances that a patient and doctor can explore
prevention issues: wellness, diet, stopping smoking, for instance.
If the goal is better health, we're defeating ourselves by not
having that kind of doctor-patient relationship.
</P>
<P>
   Q: You start your book by describing a crisis in which another
doctor refused to believe that your son was very sick, and you and
your wife sensed it was serious and challenged him. But you're both
Harvard-trained physicians. What chance would an average person
have of succeeding in a similar encounter?
</P>
<P>
   A: I hope that reading these narratives will give people
encouragement and courage to speak up. It isn't necessary to be
adversarial _ just to say, in a very clear way, ``I don't fully
understand that explanation, and I would very much like you to
explain it to me again.'' There is nothing in medicine so
complicated that it cannot be clearly communicated to anyone. And
if it doesn't make sense to the patient, then either the doctor
doesn't understand it or the doctor is not explaining it well.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What if the doctor perceives the questioning as antagonistic?
</P>
<P>
   A: The paradox here _ and this is what I hope will give people
the most courage _ is that the more you articulate to the doctor,
the more you help him or her figure out the diagnosis and craft
with you the best treatment program. That verbalization _ that sort
of offering of intuition and information from the patient and
family _ can be absolutely vital. This understandable fear that
doctors will be insulted and abandon you or in some way be
vindictive _ we need to go beyond that.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Surely that's asking for a lot of strength, at a time when
the patient is debilitated and the family may be bewildered and
afraid.
</P>
<P>
   A: It is difficult, and it is most difficult for the patient.
But the more that a patient and his family can articulate to the
doctor, the better. Think of a patient who is very ill, with family
members around the bedside. The family has known that person, in
intimate ways, for much longer than the treating physician. I say
to them outright: I want to hear from you. Please tell me what is
happening. Please cry wolf: I would rather you cry wolf 20 times
over vague symptoms than miss one important change. If a patient
even says to me, ``I really feel lousy; I feel worse than I did
yesterday,'' that means as much to me as all the results of blood
tests and the blips on the cardiac monitor.
</P>
<P>
   Q: You describe a case in which doctors absolutely disagreed
about appropriate treatment, and another where a patient's
diagnosis was never really settled. Will readers be surprised by
the ambiguity that exists in medicine?
</P>
<P>
   A: I expect so. It's hard, as a physician, to publicly expose
your limits. Everything in medical training, from the starched
white coat to the bearing and the language, is meant to project a
sense of knowledge and control. But the truth is that there are
many moments in medicine where there is no knowledge and there is
not a firm sense of control _ and that again is a place where both
the patient's intuition and the doctor's intuition are key.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Is there advice that you can encapsulate for patients?
</P>
<P>
   A: Two things. The first is the issue of asking for a second
opinion. It is a critical step for anyone facing a severe illness,
a treatment that has significant risk, an experimental therapy or a
problem where the diagnosis is not clear. In that seeking of a
second opinion, one should go to a specialist, at a different
institution, who hopefully will have a different perspective or be
able to objectively endorse the first opinion. The second is that
the understandable hesitation that patients and families have to
question a doctor or to ask for a clearer explanation, out of fear
of alienating the doctor or seeming adversarial, is actually
counterproductive. It is vital for a physician, in formulating a
diagnosis and crafting a treatment, to draw on the intuition and
information that a patient and a family can give. I want to
encourage people to be more ready to do that, and therefore to form
a real partnership in their own care.

 &HT;    Books to help you start listening to your body
 &HT;    By M.A.J. McKenna
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   In his respect for the power of intuition in medicine, Dr.
Jerome Groopman has a lot of company. A half-dozen new books advise
patients to be attentive to their own emotional and physical
symptoms. Among them:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Dr. Judith Orloff's Guide to Intuitive Healing: 5 Steps to
Physical, Emotional and Sexual Wellness'' by Dr. Judith Orloff
(being published next week by Times Books, $24). A psychiatrist and
professor at the University of California at Los Angeles, Orloff
describes herself as a ``practicing intuitive'' who uses her
internal guidance in treating patients. In this book, her second,
she counsels patients to evaluate feelings and situations through
five steps: ``Notice your beliefs, be in your body, sense your
body's subtle energy, ask for guidance and listen to your dreams.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``The Intuitive Healer: Accessing Your Inner Physician'' by
Marcia Emery (St. Martin's Press, $23.95). A psychologist and
corporate consultant, Emery guides readers through a technique she
calls the Mindshift Method, a sequence of relaxing, concentrating
and interpreting internal imagery.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Awakening Intuition: Using Your Mind-Body Network for
Insight and Healing'' by Dr. Mona Lisa Schulz (Three Rivers Press,
$14). Schulz is a neuropsychiatrist and works with Dr. Christiane
Northrup, a popular author on women's holistic health, who wrote
this book's introduction. Like Northrup, Schulz believes that
emotional and psychological disturbances surface in specific
organs, and must be addressed before physical healing can take
place.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Women's Intuition: Unlocking the Wisdom of the Body'' by
Paula M. Reeves (Conari Press, $15.95). A therapist and workshop
leader who lives in Stone Mountain, Reeves coaches readers into
understanding emotional conditions and disease states via a
practice she calls Spontaneous Contemplative Movement.

 By CLARA HEMPHILL    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Courtney McGrath now is a confident, clear-skinned
undergraduate at Cornell. But when she had teen-age acne, she was
so shy she hated to go out.
</P>
<P>
   At a junior high school party, boys called her ``the girl with
the zits all over her face.'' A stranger on a bus gave her
unsolicited advice on home remedies. ``It was all I could do not to
burst into tears,'' McGrath said. ``When you are the one with the
worst case of acne, you think it's the worst thing in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Pimples have long been a painful rite of passage for
adolescents. At a time in life when children are most concerned
about their appearances, even the pimples of superficial acne can
cause a loss of self-confidence, shyness, and, in severe cases,
depression. And the inflamed cysts of deep acne can leave permanent
scars.
</P>
<P>
   But medical science has now taken on the acne. New treatments,
some developed only in the last few years, mean that pimples can be
conquered.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ninety-five percent of people can be treated,'' said Dr.
Darrell S. Rigell, president of the American Academy of
Dermatology. ``That doesn't mean you'll never get a pimple for the
rest of your life. But more treatments are available, and they are
much more effective and with fewer side effects than they were 20
or 30 or even five years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Patients are seeking out treatment for acne partly because new
therapies are available and partly because nowadays more patients
can afford to treat conditions that are not life-threatening.
</P>
<P>
   ``Money is a little freer so people are more likely to go to the
doctors for what might be considered a cosmetic problem,'' said Dr.
Guy F. Webster, the vice chairman of the dermatology department at
Jefferson Medical Center in Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   Parents who suffered from acne themselves do not want their
children to repeat their experiences. ``I think there's been a
change in attitude,'' said Dr. Anne W. Lucky, a pediatric
dermatologist at Children's Hospital Medical Center in Cincinnati.
``Rather than grin and bear it, people come in to get treated.''
</P>
<P>
   More than 85 percent of adolescents and young adults suffer from
acne. A surprisingly large proportion of women _ estimates range
from 8 percent to 50 percent _ escape outbreaks of acne as
teen-agers only to experience them for the first time as adults.
</P>
<P>
   While many such cases are mild and disappear without treatment,
others need medical attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``It should not be considered trivial,'' said Dr. Alan R.
Shalita, the chairman of the dermatology department at SUNY
Downstate Medical Center in Brooklyn. ``It can have serious,
long-lasting psychological effects.''
</P>
<P>
   Acne among adolescents is caused by overactive oil glands
stimulated by the surge in male hormones called androgens, present
in both boys and girls, at the onset of puberty.
</P>
<P>
   Among grown women, acne is caused by hormonal fluctuations
connected to the menstrual cycle. Some doctors believe acne is
caused by or exacerbated by stress.
</P>
<P>
   Acne starts when the fatty glands attached to the skin's hair
follicles produce too much oil, called sebum. Normally, the cells
lining the hair follicles slough off regularly, and the oil passes
to the surface of the skin.
</P>
<P>
   But when there is excess oil production and when the skin cells
fail to flake off, a pore becomes plugged, and it may become
infected.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pore gets clogged and bacteria grow in the hair
follicle,'' said Dr. Gary M. White, a dermatologist in the Los
Angeles area. ``The body's immune system doesn't like the bacteria
and fights it. The red you see is the battle going on where the
immune system is trying to kill that bacteria. If you can unclog
that pore you can empty out the bacteria.''
</P>
<P>
   The ancient Greeks used sulfur to control pimples, a substance
still in use today. Benzoyl peroxide, an over-the-counter
medication sold under brand names like Clearasil and Benzac; oral
antibiotics; and birth control pills have also been used for many
years.
</P>
<P>
   But in 1982 researchers developed Accutane, a vitamin A
derivative that, taken in pill form, was a more effective
treatment. But, as its maker, Roche Laboratories, warns, Accutane
can have side effects ranging from chapped skin to birth defects.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors often require women of childbearing age who take it to
use two forms of birth control. All patients taking Accutane must
have regular blood tests to check their liver functions.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, researchers have been developing a wide array of
prescription gels, creams and lotions that can be applied to the
skin singly or in combination with other remedies.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's an enormous explosion in what we are able to do,''
said Dr. Seth J. Orlow, a specialist in pediatric and adolescent
dermatology at New York University Medical Center.
</P>
<P>
   The newer treatments are topical _ creams or gels spread on the
face _ and are less likely to have side effects. They include
tazarotene (sold by Allergan under the name Tazorac) and and
adapalene (sold by Galderma under the name Differin).
</P>
<P>
   Both are retinoids that function like vitamin A derivatives. So
women who plan on becoming pregnant are also advised not to take
Tazorac or Differin, because their effects on the fetus are not
known.
</P>
<P>
   But these topical creams are less irritating to the skin than
Accutane. They loosen the cells and oils that clog the pores and
also prevent creation of new acne lesions.
</P>
<P>
   Oral and topical antibiotics are used as well, sometimes in
combination with other treatments.
</P>
<P>
   Antibiotics decrease the bacteria that cause the infections.
Another new therapy is azelaic acid (made by Allergan), an
antibacterial cream, approved by the Food and Drug Administration
in 1996, that unclogs the pores that cause pimples.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors now agree that many things long linked to acne _ like
failing to wash adequately _ in fact have no effect. ``Thinking
about sex, eating chocolate and pizza doesn't cause acne,'' said
Dr. John J. Russell of Abington Memorial Hospital in Abington, Pa.,
who wrote an article on new acne treatments in the January issue of
American Family Physician.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a hormonal thing,'' Russell said. ``It's not a problem of
hygiene. There are teen-agers who wash their faces 10 times a day
and they still get acne.''
</P>
<P>
   The severity of acne is in part indicated by how early children
get their first pimples. ``Girls who get acne before they start
they menstrual periods are more at risk of severe acne,'' Lucky
said. ``If you've already had your period for three or four years
and you get acne, you're probably not going to get it seriously.''
</P>
<P>
   McGrath, the Cornell student, used countless over-the-counter
remedies and was treated by several doctors over the course of four
years, without success.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Dr. Diane S. Berson brought her acne under control with
a strong dose of Accutane. ``I was so excited,'` McGrath said. ``It
definitely altered my social experience.''

REPUBLICAN FOREIGN-POLICY PERSPECTIVES: MORALISTS VS. REALISTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By NORMAN LEVINE  
 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; (ALSO MOVING IN ``A'' CATEGORY. / SECOND IN A SERIES OF THREE)
The author examines the Republican ``Conservative Moralist'' and
``Conservative Realist'' positions in the debate over the dire
 &UR; ction of American foreign policy.)
</P>
<P>
   The Great Foreign Policy Debate of 2000 is a cascade of ink not
limited to the battle of the journals. It has become a bonanza as
well for the publishing industry as authors from different research
institutes flood bookstores and libraries with their tomes.
</P>
<P>
   The most prestigious outlet for discussions of international
affairs is the bimonthly magazine ``Foreign Affairs,'' which
specializes in the disputations of diplomats.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, Robert Kagan, senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment
for Peace, and his intellectual soul mate, Bill Kristol, editor of
the ``Weekly Standard'' journal, co-wrote an article in ``Foreign
Affairs''called ``Toward a Neo-Reaganite Foreign Policy,'' in which
they wrote: ``Finally, American foreign policy should be informed
with a clear moral purpose, based on the understanding that its
moral goals and its fundamental national interest are almost in
harmony . . . The remoralization of America at home ultimately
requires the remoralization of American foreign policy.''
</P>
<P>
   `GREAT FATHER FIGURE' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``History shows that democracies do not fight each other,''
writes Robert Kagan, who may be considered the leading advocate of
the Conservative Moralist congregation. ``American democracy should
be expansionary, and the U.S. should be more assertive and activist
in enlarging the frontiers of democracy around the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``I take Ronald Reagan as the great father figure of American
foreign policy. Not only was Reagan skeptical of international
organizations, but he also understood the necessity for the U.S. to
act unilaterally and to intervene into the affairs of another
country on the grounds of American national interest. Reagan had an
intuitive grasp of hard power, or military force.''
</P>
<P>
   REALISM AND MORALISM &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Kagan traces his intellectual ancestry to Teddy Roosevelt.
</P>
<P>
   ``I join realism and moralism,'' Kagan said, ``and so did Teddy
Roosevelt. Woodrow Wilson, for all his genius, even though he
desired to make the `world safe for democracy,' was willing to
sacrifice American sovereignty to a world government.
</P>
<P>
   ``TR (Teddy Roosevelt) would not have done that, but recognized
the need to use U.S. power unilaterally to spread American ideas
and values. Reagan was part of the TR (Roosevelt) tradition.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Ledeen, research fellow at the American Enterprise
Institute, has published a book, ``Freedom Betrayed,'' that reads
like a hymn to the American system.
</P>
<P>
   According to Ledeen, the democratic revolution has passed
through two periods: The first was the American Revolution of 1776,
and the second is America in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   A proselytizing Democrat, Ledeen attaches himself to the Wilson
who sought to ``make the world safe for democracy,'' and ``Freedom
Betrayed'' presents the United States as a revolutionary power, a
``chosen nation'' for converting the world to democracy.
</P>
<P>
   DEMOCRATIC IMPERIALISM? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The dogma of Conservative Moralists is open to theological
dispute.
</P>
<P>
   Kagan, Kristol and Ledeen abandon the principles of George
Kennan's ``containment policy'' through which America won the Cold
War. The containment policy was essentially a static program, for
it conformed to a bipolar world, and it assumed that both the
Soviet Union and the United States would remain on their sides of
the Iron Curtain, while Washington waited for the decay of
Stalinist Communist imperialism.
</P>
<P>
   The priesthood of Conservative Moralism wants to replace the
static nature of the containment policy with a form of democratic
imperialism.
</P>
<P>
   Arguing that the post-Cold War world is a monopolar one in which
the United State is preeminent, that limits to American
expansionism no longer exist, this College of Cardinals seeks to
root the democratic flag in such far-away places as Azerbaijan,
Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan (countries that few Americans even know
are on the map) _ all of which, not incidentally, are enormously
rich in oil and natural-gas deposits.
</P>
<P>
   These foreign-policy gurus have not proved their claim that
unilateral intervention into the affairs of a sovereign country is
an effective means of installing democracy in a nation. Government
through the consent of the people arises only when other supportive
institutions exist, such as a free press, an independent judiciary
and a population committed to the principles of civil rights, and
these cannot be imposed by paratroopers descending from the sky.
</P>
<P>
   DEMOCRACY OR CAPITALISM &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Lastly, the prophets of Conservative Moralism do not clearly
indicate which they wish to export _ democracy or capitalism.
Michael Ledeen, however, does have the courage of his faith, for he
wishes to export the Reagan Republican Platform of 1980.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Freedom Betrayed,''Ledeen defines the democratic
revolution: ``Today it means waging war against the growing power
of the preeminent modern institution: state bureaucracy . . That is
why the call to slash the size of government is such an integral
part of the democratic revolution.''
</P>
<P>
   But there is a difference between the American Constitution and
the Republican platform of 1980: Although it is patriotism to ask
American soldiers to fight for the Constitution, it is bottomless
greed to ask them to fight to imperialize the Reagan 1980 campaign
slogans.
</P>
<P>
   Wishing to position itself as the final arbiter of the Great
Debate, ``Foreign Affairs'' has devoted its January-February 2000
issue to the Republican side of this argument. In this issue,
Condoleezza Rice wrote the lead article, ``Promoting the National
Interest,'' an exposition of the Conservative Realist position. In
the March/April 2000 issue, ``Foreign Affairs''will follow up with
the Democratic response.
</P>
<P>
   NATION COMES FIRST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Rice has deep roots in the Bush dynasty because she worked as a
Russian specialist on the National Security Council under President
Bush and presidential adviser Brent Scowcroft. A book by Bush and
Scowcroft, ``A World Transformed,'' refers to her as extremely
competent and knowledgeable.
</P>
<P>
   Re-emphasizing one of the major principles of Conservative
Realism, Rice upholds the primacy of national interest over
international organizations and norms. The theory of ``universal
human rights'' is a wonderful ideal, but here also national
interest takes priority over the banner of universal human rights.
</P>
<P>
   In terms of Russia, Rice supports the expansion of NATO to
include Poland, the Czech Republic and Hungary. The United States
should not be deterred by Russian anger because of the ballooning
of NATO into real estate once controlled by Soviet armies.
</P>
<P>
   The former Soviet specialist to Bush favors U.S. support for the
continued independence of the Ukraine and other countries in
Central Asia that seek to protect their sovereignty from Russian
control.
</P>
<P>
   REBUILD MILITARY &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Caspian Sea region is of vital importance for U.S. interests
because of its huge oil and natural-gas reserves. In this region of
the globe, the policy of containing the Soviet Union is replaced by
the policy of dismembering Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Criticizing President Clinton for cutting the defense budget,
Rice wants to rebuild the military to throw out the 1972
Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty with the Russians and construct a
national missile-defense system. The defeat of the renewal of the
1992 Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty was correct. In the last
analysis, it is ``hard power,'' the persuasiveness of the bullet,
that determines the fate of nations.
</P>
<P>
   Rice favors U.S. participation in all international
organizations because such collaboration is an advantage to the
national interests of America.
</P>
<P>
   For example, she favors continued U.S. participation in the
World Trade Organization, because she favors opening markets for
U.S. exports. Trade is an important instrument of U.S. foreign
policy, and the international reduction of tariffs and other trade
barriers represents a gain to the United States because it helps
create an entrepreneurial capitalist class in whatever nation
becomes a partner in these commercial networks.
</P>
<P>
   Expanding trade with China, the former national security adviser
believes, is in American national self-interest because it will
speed economic liberalization, and the emergence of an aggressive
capitalist phalanx could act as the springboard for the sprouting
of political democracy. Unlike Clinton, however, Rice does not view
China as a ``strategic partner'' but as a ``strategic competitor.''
</P>
<P>
   The Conservative Realists want to maintain Taiwanese
independence, and they image themselves as the party of the right
on the China issue. In essence, they want to create an East Asian
``rollback theory'' in the style of John Foster Dulles, keeping
China out of Taiwan and forcing China out of Tibet.
</P>
<P>
   CEASE BEING WORLD'S POLICE &QL;
</P>
<P>
   From her new position at Stanford University, Rice launched has
her most spirited diatribes against the Clinton administration on
the question of humanitarian intervention. She points to the
failure of such action in Haiti and to the ineffectiveness of
multilateral humanitarian intervention in Somalia,
Bosnia-Herzegovina and Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the United States exerts hard hegemonic power in the
world, it should not act as the earth's ``globocop.'' Rice does not
believe that it is within the national interest of the United
States to play the universal gendarme.
</P>
<P>
   Not only is Rice an authoritative voice from the Conservative
Realist pew, but the probable ghostwriter on foreign policy for
Gov. George W. Bush. There is no difference in substance between
the Rice essay and a speech on America's position in the world that
Bush gave to kick off his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Jeane Kirkpatrick, U.S. ambassador to the United Nations under
Reagan, agrees with Rice, particularly on the need to protect U.S.
sovereignty and to build an anti-ballistic missile defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am glad the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty was defeated,''
Kirkpatrick confessed. ``I worked for five years at the U.N., and I
can tell you that votes in the General Assembly are often stampeded
and ill-informed. There are over 150 members in the General
Assembly, and the vast majority have no experience with nuclear
weapons, and so their votes are not based on fact or experience. It
is wrong to give such a body a literal veto over American
armaments, defense and national interests.
</P>
<P>
   ``I recall discussing the issue of the anti-ballistic missile
defense system with Ronald Reagan. The president looked upon a
system which could prevent an attack as a moral imperative because
it would prevent incalculable carnage. He believed that the policy
of MAD _ mutually assured destruction _ was immoral because it left
open the possibility of attack and cataclysmic bloodshed. To be
able to deter such an attack was equal to defending against
unprecedented inhumanity.''
</P>
<P>
   MCCAIN BEEFS UP HIS TEAM &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John McCain is also a member of the Conservative Realist
choir.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, McCain has added some illustrious names to his
foreign-policy team. Other notable foreign-policy sages now stand
alongside Henry Kissinger in the ex-Navy pilot's camp, and they
include Zbigniew Brzezinski, Larry Eagleberger, Kirkpatrick and R.
James Woolsey.
</P>
<P>
   The ex-prisoner of war also looks suspiciously upon mainland
China. Although McCain supports the maintainence of normal trade
relations with China, he looks upon that country of 1.2 billion
people as a rival to the United State in the Pacific Rim, and he
stands firmly for continued independence of Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   The November election will undoubtedly witness impassioned
disagreements over China's entry into the World Trade Organization.
China already enjoys most-favored-nation trading rights with the
United States and a mushrooming trade surplus.
</P>
<P>
   CHINA AT CENTER &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Judging China as a potential adversary, McCain wants to link
membership in the World Trade Organization with domestic
liberalization in China. Rather than remain in a state of Clinton
self-denial, Conservative Realists want China to broaden universal
rights, grant religious freedom and cease political repression
before granting it equal representation in the trade group.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of whether Bush or McCain becomes the GOP
presidential contender, China will become the center of gravity of
the foreign-policy debates. For most of the 12 years that
Republicans held the White House, from 1980 to 1992 under Reagan
and George Bush, the Cold War raged and Republicans looked tougher
on the Soviet Union than Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Evil Empire'' has disappeared, the bipolar world is a
theme of the past, but the Republicans have also suffered their
losses: They can no longer appear as the knights of anti-communism.
To reinvent their image as Sir Lancelot slaying the Red Dragon,
they are trying to paint Beijing as the Second KGB. Abiding by the
philosophy of ``Wag the Dog,'' if a war does not exist, then it is
necessary to invent one.

U.S. FOREIGN POLICY, THE DEMOCRATIC WAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By NORMAN LEVINE  
 c.2000 Special for The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; (LAST IN A SERIES OF THREE ARTICLES. ALSO MOVING IN THE ``A''
CATEGORY  &UR; - RESENDING INHERITING-1, INHERITING-2 AND INHERITING-3
FOR THOSE WHO MAY HAVE MISSED THIS SPECIAL PACKAGE. The author
 &UR; examines the Democratic ``Liberal Moralist'' and ``Liberal
Realist''
 &UR; positions in the debate over the direction of American foreign
policy.)
</P>
<P>
   The American people are undergoing an out-of-body experience:
History is repeating itself, and they have been transferred back to
1920 and the battle waged by Woodrow Wilson and Henry Cabot Lodge
over America's entry into the League of Nations.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson wanted both to make the world ``safe for democracy'' and
for the United States to obey the covenant of the League of
Nations, irrespective of national self-interest. His opponent was
Lodge, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, and
although Lodge favored America's entry into the League, he wished
to modify certain articles as a means of preserving U.S. national
self-interest.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson refused to make any concessions and, in 1920, the League
went down to defeat. The conservatives of 2000 are the spiritual
descendants of Lodge, while present-day liberals inherit the legacy
of Wilson.
</P>
<P>
   As a liberal moralist, Clintonian foreign policy is an amalgam
of Wilson, Jimmy Carter's ``universal human rights'' and reaction
against the Vietnam War with its rejection of unilateral action by
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   After initial hesitation in 1993, Clintonian diplomacy shattered
the boundaries of the containment of Communism theory articulated
by George F. Kennan, a foreign-policy expert and diplomat, at the
beginning of the Cold War. Essentially a strategy to halt further
imperialism of the Stalinist empire, containment theory limited the
extension of American power to the Elbe, which, from 1947 to 1990,
was the eastern border of Germany. &QL; 
NATO EXPANSION &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Clintonian foreign policy committed itself to the enlargement of
the horizon of democracy, and Clinton pursued this goal on two
fronts: expansion of NATO in Europe and support of Boris Yeltsin in
Russia. When Clinton embarked on the jihad of making the world safe
for democracy, he not only embraced this aspect of Wilsonism but
capitulated to the arguments of Anthony Lake, his first national
security adviser.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton Doctrine brought Poland, the Czech Republic and
Hungary into NATO. By including these three countries under the
NATO umbrella, the United States committed itself to the defense of
countries it never previously considered within its own sphere of
national self-interest. This enormous broadening of American
guarantees was justified under the principle of missionary
democracy.
</P>
<P>
   In expanding NATO, Clinton broke American implied agreements
with Mikhail Gorbachev. ``A World Transformed,'' written by George
Bush, who was president at the time of the disintegration of the
Soviet Empire in Eastern Europe, and Brent Scowcroft, Bush's
national security adviser, is unequivocal on this point: At no time
did Bush, Scowcroft, or Secretary of State James Baker indicate to
Gorbachev that NATO would be extended eastward to Poland, the Czech
Republic and Hungary after the Soviets voluntarily renounced their
title to these tracts of land.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. policy toward Yeltsin was another case of missionary
democracy. The Clinton administration adamantly supported Yeltsin
on the grounds that he was leading the democratic capitalist
transformation of Russia.
</P>
<P>
   However, Yeltsin's resignation from office and the crowning of
Vladimir Putin as his successor is a serious setback for the
Clinton doctrine. Putin's recent alliance with the Communists
belies the assertion that democracy is functioning in Russia.
</P>
<P>
   According to Lee Hamilton, Democratic loyalist, respected former
chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, and current
director of the Woodrow Wilson Foundation, Putin's recent coalition
with the Communists ``amounts to a defeat for Clinton, for it
strengthens the power of the Communists in the Duma.'' &QL; 
PUSHING MULTILATERALISM &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Another Wilson ideal that the Clinton doctrine continues is that
American diplomacy should unfold within multilateral institutions.
Liberal moralists are suspicious of unilateral actions because they
fear it will give rise to worldwide anti-Americanism.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of the fact that recent ventures in which America
acted under the aegis of the United Nations _ such as in Somalia,
Bosnia-Herzegovina and Kosovo _ all appear to be failures, the
White House still upholds the usefulness of multilateralism. The
Oval Office fears the bully backlash _ that other nations will
express their resentment against the paramountcy of the United
States by opposing American policies.
</P>
<P>
   Another principle of liberal moralism to which the Clinton
doctrine abides is free trade.
</P>
<P>
   Liberal moralism wishes to turn the movement toward economic
globalization to an advantage for the United States, and so Clinton
has devoted much effort to the reduction of tariffs.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton wishes to use trade as a form of social engineering,
because he hopes that free trade will encourage the growth of a
capitalist entrepreneurial class in countries making the transition
out of communism, like China. Borrowing a phrase from his former
economic adviser, Andrea Tyson, Clinton thinks in terms of
``strategic trade,'' or trade with a deeper purpose than just
making a profit.
</P>
<P>
   In its approach to China, the Clinton doctrine combines the
strategic trade and the ``strategic partner'' approaches.
</P>
<P>
   The theory of the strategic partner is to detach China from any
``anti-hegemonist'' bloc alliance. Primarily, this means preventing
the re-creation of the Cold War Sino-Soviet coalition. &QL; 
OVAL OFFICE'S PLAN &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The hook of strategic trade is associated with the universal
human-rights theory of Carter. By its use of strategic trade, the
Oval Office hopes to ensnare President Jiang Zemin into granting
more ``human rights'' to Chinese citizens. The ultimate aim of
trans-Pacific social engineering is to both speed the development
of a commercial middle class in China and to provide these
entrepreneurs with the protective shield of civil liberties.
</P>
<P>
   Conservatives of all camps attack the Clinton doctrine on China
as a contradiction between rewards and punishments.
</P>
<P>
   Reflecting upon the differences that separate Republicans and
Democrats, Democratic loyalist Hamilton told ``The Arizona
Republic,'' ``Republicans are very skeptical of international
organizations, such as the U.N., the World Trade Organization and
the like. Democrats generally support these multilateral
institutions.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a monopolar world in the social and economic
sense. Even though the U.S. is the only superpower in the military
or `hard' sense, it cannot dictate to all nations of the globe in
matters of gender, children, values or culture. In terms of `soft'
power _ education, information and trade, this is a multipolar
world and the U.S. must learn to act in conjunction with
international organizations.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is important to recognize that the most important lever of
diplomatic power has changed from `hard' to `soft' power. To me,
trade is the crucial issue.'' &QL; 
PARTY SPLIT ON POLICIES &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``The Republicans tend to stress military power,'' Hamilton
added. ``I am an unrepentant free-trader because I believe that
unrestricted trade, from which all sides benefit, is the best way
to export the democratic order.''
</P>
<P>
   But policies are divisive ones within the Democratic Party. To
hold the presidency again in November, Democrats desperately need
the support of American labor, and the AFL-CIO has already endorsed
Vice President Al Gore. Nevertheless, a divorce has taken place
between the corporatist and labor wings of the Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   The corporatists favor strategic trade and China's entry into
the World Trade Organization, because they will be the ``winners''
from the globalization of trade, while Big Labor is opposed to
these policies, because they will be the ``losers'' when domestic
wages are repressed. The Seattle meeting of the World Trade
Organization ended in chaos when Big Labor and environmentalists
led street demonstrations demanding environmental protections, an
end to child labor in China and other Asian countries and
improvement of working conditions before any further reduction of
tariffs.
</P>
<P>
   The issues of China and world trade will be hotly debated along
partisan lines when Congress is called on to approve China's entry
into the World Trade Organization in the fall, and they will play a
major role in the November elections.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has already become a victim of the Democratic dependency on
Big Labor. Gore suffers from a split personality: one face as vice
president and the other as party candidate. As vice president, he
speaks in favor of the Clinton doctrine, but as candidate he must
massage the labor unions.
</P>
<P>
   This past week, Gore's divided personality made the front pages
when the AFL-CIO criticized him for placing the reduction of
tariffs before the increase of wages, the growth of labor unions
and the end of sweat shops in Third World countries.
</P>
<P>
   In spite of Gore's problems with the labor unions, he is also a
Liberal Moralist. In the war of words currently waged in opinion
journals, Stephen M. Walt, a professor of international relations
at Harvard University, has acted as the vice president's script
writer. In an article in the March/April issue of ``Foreign
Affairs,'' Walt has written a Democratic response to the Republican
broadsides that were published by ``Foreign Affairs'' in the
previous issue. The vice president's proxy only proved that on
foreign affairs, Gore is a clone of Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Bradley is also a Liberal Moralist and although there are
no significant differences between Gore and Clinton, there are
important divisions between Gore-Clinton and Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   Gore-Clinton favor an increase in the defense budget, but
Bradley advocates a cut in appropriations for the Defense
Department. Bradley would use the money saved from the military
spending for his domestic agenda such as his health and
anti-poverty programs. Bradley is also far more attuned to the
growing gulf between the cyberspace Atlantic world and the
spinning-wheel Third World.  &QL; 
`BULLY BACKLASH' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Liberal realists, particularly professor Michael Mandelbaum of
the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies, agrees
with Clinton-Gore that it is vital to work within multinational
organizations, but he dissents from the Clinton doctrine on the
issue that America should become a global proselytizer for
democracy.
</P>
<P>
   Mandelbaum led the charge against the expansion of NATO because
he feared the ``bully backlash.'' Mandelbaum's essay, ``Foreign
Policy as Social Work,'' appeared in the January/February 1996
issue of ``Foreign Affairs.'' In the essay, he criticized Clinton
for seeking to turn the United States into the messiah of
constitutional government.
</P>
<P>
   Mandelbaum wrote of Clinton and Lake, his first national
security adviser: ``They tried and failed to turn American foreign
policy into a branch of social work.''
</P>
<P>
   Clintonian foreign policy, Mandelbaum and the entire liberal
realist camp argues, has overextended and overtaxed U.S. resources
around the world. The liberal realists oppose intervention in the
internal affairs of other sovereign states, and they reject the
notion that America can play the world's shrink, using the methods
of a social worker to aid the dysfunctional.
</P>
<P>
   No Republican or Democratic candidate in the current campaign
embraces isolationist or protectionist positions. As the new
century dawns, the United States is experiencing instant historical
replay. The First World War is over, the Treaty of Versailles is
written, and America in 2000 must decide whether it will sign the
League of Nations in 1920.
</P>
<P>
   All those who favor close collaboration with international
organizations, forgoing all instances of unilateral intervention,
will vote for Woodrow Wilson. All those who favor the retention of
full American self-interest, the need for unilateral intervention
to further national security, will vote for Lodge. But whatever
your vote, you must face the consequences: If Americans can put
aside their obsession with the marrying-a- multimillionaire
melodrama, they will bear in mind that history is a life-and-death
sentence, that it repeats itself, and the Second World War followed
the First.  &QL;

REPUBLICAN FOREIGN-POLICY PERSPECTIVES: MORALISTS VS. REALISTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By NORMAN LEVINE  
 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; (ALSO MOVING IN ``K'' CATEGORY. / SECOND IN A SERIES OF THREE)
The author examines the Republican ``Conservative Moralist'' and
``Conservative Realist'' positions in the debate over the dire
 &UR; ction of American foreign policy.)
</P>
<P>
   The Great Foreign Policy Debate of 2000 is a cascade of ink not
limited to the battle of the journals. It has become a bonanza as
well for the publishing industry as authors from different research
institutes flood bookstores and libraries with their tomes.
</P>
<P>
   The most prestigious outlet for discussions of international
affairs is the bimonthly magazine ``Foreign Affairs,'' which
specializes in the disputations of diplomats.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, Robert Kagan, senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment
for Peace, and his intellectual soul mate, Bill Kristol, editor of
the ``Weekly Standard'' journal, co-wrote an article in ``Foreign
Affairs''called ``Toward a Neo-Reaganite Foreign Policy,'' in which
they wrote: ``Finally, American foreign policy should be informed
with a clear moral purpose, based on the understanding that its
moral goals and its fundamental national interest are almost in
harmony . . . The remoralization of America at home ultimately
requires the remoralization of American foreign policy.''
</P>
<P>
   `GREAT FATHER FIGURE' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``History shows that democracies do not fight each other,''
writes Robert Kagan, who may be considered the leading advocate of
the Conservative Moralist congregation. ``American democracy should
be expansionary, and the U.S. should be more assertive and activist
in enlarging the frontiers of democracy around the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``I take Ronald Reagan as the great father figure of American
foreign policy. Not only was Reagan skeptical of international
organizations, but he also understood the necessity for the U.S. to
act unilaterally and to intervene into the affairs of another
country on the grounds of American national interest. Reagan had an
intuitive grasp of hard power, or military force.''
</P>
<P>
   REALISM AND MORALISM &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Kagan traces his intellectual ancestry to Teddy Roosevelt.
</P>
<P>
   ``I join realism and moralism,'' Kagan said, ``and so did Teddy
Roosevelt. Woodrow Wilson, for all his genius, even though he
desired to make the `world safe for democracy,' was willing to
sacrifice American sovereignty to a world government.
</P>
<P>
   ``TR (Teddy Roosevelt) would not have done that, but recognized
the need to use U.S. power unilaterally to spread American ideas
and values. Reagan was part of the TR (Roosevelt) tradition.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Ledeen, research fellow at the American Enterprise
Institute, has published a book, ``Freedom Betrayed,'' that reads
like a hymn to the American system.
</P>
<P>
   According to Ledeen, the democratic revolution has passed
through two periods: The first was the American Revolution of 1776,
and the second is America in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   A proselytizing Democrat, Ledeen attaches himself to the Wilson
who sought to ``make the world safe for democracy,'' and ``Freedom
Betrayed'' presents the United States as a revolutionary power, a
``chosen nation'' for converting the world to democracy.
</P>
<P>
   DEMOCRATIC IMPERIALISM? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The dogma of Conservative Moralists is open to theological
dispute.
</P>
<P>
   Kagan, Kristol and Ledeen abandon the principles of George
Kennan's ``containment policy'' through which America won the Cold
War. The containment policy was essentially a static program, for
it conformed to a bipolar world, and it assumed that both the
Soviet Union and the United States would remain on their sides of
the Iron Curtain, while Washington waited for the decay of
Stalinist Communist imperialism.
</P>
<P>
   The priesthood of Conservative Moralism wants to replace the
static nature of the containment policy with a form of democratic
imperialism.
</P>
<P>
   Arguing that the post-Cold War world is a monopolar one in which
the United State is preeminent, that limits to American
expansionism no longer exist, this College of Cardinals seeks to
root the democratic flag in such far-away places as Azerbaijan,
Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan (countries that few Americans even know
are on the map) _ all of which, not incidentally, are enormously
rich in oil and natural-gas deposits.
</P>
<P>
   These foreign-policy gurus have not proved their claim that
unilateral intervention into the affairs of a sovereign country is
an effective means of installing democracy in a nation. Government
through the consent of the people arises only when other supportive
institutions exist, such as a free press, an independent judiciary
and a population committed to the principles of civil rights, and
these cannot be imposed by paratroopers descending from the sky.
</P>
<P>
   DEMOCRACY OR CAPITALISM &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Lastly, the prophets of Conservative Moralism do not clearly
indicate which they wish to export _ democracy or capitalism.
Michael Ledeen, however, does have the courage of his faith, for he
wishes to export the Reagan Republican Platform of 1980.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Freedom Betrayed,''Ledeen defines the democratic
revolution: ``Today it means waging war against the growing power
of the preeminent modern institution: state bureaucracy . . That is
why the call to slash the size of government is such an integral
part of the democratic revolution.''
</P>
<P>
   But there is a difference between the American Constitution and
the Republican platform of 1980: Although it is patriotism to ask
American soldiers to fight for the Constitution, it is bottomless
greed to ask them to fight to imperialize the Reagan 1980 campaign
slogans.
</P>
<P>
   Wishing to position itself as the final arbiter of the Great
Debate, ``Foreign Affairs'' has devoted its January-February 2000
issue to the Republican side of this argument. In this issue,
Condoleezza Rice wrote the lead article, ``Promoting the National
Interest,'' an exposition of the Conservative Realist position. In
the March/April 2000 issue, ``Foreign Affairs''will follow up with
the Democratic response.
</P>
<P>
   NATION COMES FIRST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Rice has deep roots in the Bush dynasty because she worked as a
Russian specialist on the National Security Council under President
Bush and presidential adviser Brent Scowcroft. A book by Bush and
Scowcroft, ``A World Transformed,'' refers to her as extremely
competent and knowledgeable.
</P>
<P>
   Re-emphasizing one of the major principles of Conservative
Realism, Rice upholds the primacy of national interest over
international organizations and norms. The theory of ``universal
human rights'' is a wonderful ideal, but here also national
interest takes priority over the banner of universal human rights.
</P>
<P>
   In terms of Russia, Rice supports the expansion of NATO to
include Poland, the Czech Republic and Hungary. The United States
should not be deterred by Russian anger because of the ballooning
of NATO into real estate once controlled by Soviet armies.
</P>
<P>
   The former Soviet specialist to Bush favors U.S. support for the
continued independence of the Ukraine and other countries in
Central Asia that seek to protect their sovereignty from Russian
control.
</P>
<P>
   REBUILD MILITARY &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Caspian Sea region is of vital importance for U.S. interests
because of its huge oil and natural-gas reserves. In this region of
the globe, the policy of containing the Soviet Union is replaced by
the policy of dismembering Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Criticizing President Clinton for cutting the defense budget,
Rice wants to rebuild the military to throw out the 1972
Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty with the Russians and construct a
national missile-defense system. The defeat of the renewal of the
1992 Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty was correct. In the last
analysis, it is ``hard power,'' the persuasiveness of the bullet,
that determines the fate of nations.
</P>
<P>
   Rice favors U.S. participation in all international
organizations because such collaboration is an advantage to the
national interests of America.
</P>
<P>
   For example, she favors continued U.S. participation in the
World Trade Organization, because she favors opening markets for
U.S. exports. Trade is an important instrument of U.S. foreign
policy, and the international reduction of tariffs and other trade
barriers represents a gain to the United States because it helps
create an entrepreneurial capitalist class in whatever nation
becomes a partner in these commercial networks.
</P>
<P>
   Expanding trade with China, the former national security adviser
believes, is in American national self-interest because it will
speed economic liberalization, and the emergence of an aggressive
capitalist phalanx could act as the springboard for the sprouting
of political democracy. Unlike Clinton, however, Rice does not view
China as a ``strategic partner'' but as a ``strategic competitor.''
</P>
<P>
   The Conservative Realists want to maintain Taiwanese
independence, and they image themselves as the party of the right
on the China issue. In essence, they want to create an East Asian
``rollback theory'' in the style of John Foster Dulles, keeping
China out of Taiwan and forcing China out of Tibet.
</P>
<P>
   CEASE BEING WORLD'S POLICE &QL;
</P>
<P>
   From her new position at Stanford University, Rice launched has
her most spirited diatribes against the Clinton administration on
the question of humanitarian intervention. She points to the
failure of such action in Haiti and to the ineffectiveness of
multilateral humanitarian intervention in Somalia,
Bosnia-Herzegovina and Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the United States exerts hard hegemonic power in the
world, it should not act as the earth's ``globocop.'' Rice does not
believe that it is within the national interest of the United
States to play the universal gendarme.
</P>
<P>
   Not only is Rice an authoritative voice from the Conservative
Realist pew, but the probable ghostwriter on foreign policy for
Gov. George W. Bush. There is no difference in substance between
the Rice essay and a speech on America's position in the world that
Bush gave to kick off his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Jeane Kirkpatrick, U.S. ambassador to the United Nations under
Reagan, agrees with Rice, particularly on the need to protect U.S.
sovereignty and to build an anti-ballistic missile defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am glad the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty was defeated,''
Kirkpatrick confessed. ``I worked for five years at the U.N., and I
can tell you that votes in the General Assembly are often stampeded
and ill-informed. There are over 150 members in the General
Assembly, and the vast majority have no experience with nuclear
weapons, and so their votes are not based on fact or experience. It
is wrong to give such a body a literal veto over American
armaments, defense and national interests.
</P>
<P>
   ``I recall discussing the issue of the anti-ballistic missile
defense system with Ronald Reagan. The president looked upon a
system which could prevent an attack as a moral imperative because
it would prevent incalculable carnage. He believed that the policy
of MAD _ mutually assured destruction _ was immoral because it left
open the possibility of attack and cataclysmic bloodshed. To be
able to deter such an attack was equal to defending against
unprecedented inhumanity.''
</P>
<P>
   MCCAIN BEEFS UP HIS TEAM &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John McCain is also a member of the Conservative Realist
choir.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, McCain has added some illustrious names to his
foreign-policy team. Other notable foreign-policy sages now stand
alongside Henry Kissinger in the ex-Navy pilot's camp, and they
include Zbigniew Brzezinski, Larry Eagleberger, Kirkpatrick and R.
James Woolsey.
</P>
<P>
   The ex-prisoner of war also looks suspiciously upon mainland
China. Although McCain supports the maintainence of normal trade
relations with China, he looks upon that country of 1.2 billion
people as a rival to the United State in the Pacific Rim, and he
stands firmly for continued independence of Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   The November election will undoubtedly witness impassioned
disagreements over China's entry into the World Trade Organization.
China already enjoys most-favored-nation trading rights with the
United States and a mushrooming trade surplus.
</P>
<P>
   CHINA AT CENTER &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Judging China as a potential adversary, McCain wants to link
membership in the World Trade Organization with domestic
liberalization in China. Rather than remain in a state of Clinton
self-denial, Conservative Realists want China to broaden universal
rights, grant religious freedom and cease political repression
before granting it equal representation in the trade group.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of whether Bush or McCain becomes the GOP
presidential contender, China will become the center of gravity of
the foreign-policy debates. For most of the 12 years that
Republicans held the White House, from 1980 to 1992 under Reagan
and George Bush, the Cold War raged and Republicans looked tougher
on the Soviet Union than Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Evil Empire'' has disappeared, the bipolar world is a
theme of the past, but the Republicans have also suffered their
losses: They can no longer appear as the knights of anti-communism.
To reinvent their image as Sir Lancelot slaying the Red Dragon,
they are trying to paint Beijing as the Second KGB. Abiding by the
philosophy of ``Wag the Dog,'' if a war does not exist, then it is
necessary to invent one.
</P>

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Doctors have amputated the wrong leg, killed patients with
overdoses of medications and committed other serious errors for
centuries. So why only now is a U.S. president calling for the
first national plan to reduce such errors?
</P>
<P>
   The reasons behind the new concern are as complex as medicine
itself and as varied as recent changes in society, including
medical advances, greater complexity of care, increasing challenge
to medical authority and new techniques to pinpoint sources of
errors in the maze of systems that doctors and hospital staffs use
every day.
</P>
<P>
   Also, mounting complaints about managed care have intensified
concern about the quality of health care, and placing a spotlight
on medical errors grabs public attention in a way that other
quality of care issues do not.
</P>
<P>
   As Dr. Mark R. Chassin, a former New York state health
commissioner, put it: ``Talk about overuse and underuse of health
care, issues that are as important as errors, and everybody goes to
sleep. But mistakes can happen to anybody, and they provoke a
visceral fear that is real.''
</P>
<P>
   The spark for President Clinton's plan was a report in November
from the Institute of Medicine of the National Academy of Sciences
that said up to 98,000 patients died from preventable medical
errors in American hospitals each year, but that the number could
be halved in five years.
</P>
<P>
   In adopting most of the institute's recommendations, Clinton has
called for a new patient safety center in the government to conduct
research on reducing medical errors. He has also called for
mandatory reporting systems for deaths and serious injuries, and
voluntary reporting for less serious injuries and close calls.
</P>
<P>
   Development of an avalanche of effective therapies has brought
its own problems. Until mid-20th century, doctors had little to
offer seriously ill people. Now many new, effective therapies for
heart disease, cancer and other ailments have raised public
expectations.
</P>
<P>
   But the newer therapies have also increased enormously the
complexity of medicine and the risk of errors. And because many
therapies are so powerful, tiny errors in doses can increase the
risk of life-threatening complications.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors can no longer rely solely on their own experience in
treating patients. ``Do that and you will inevitably commit
malpractice,'' said Chassin, who is chairman of the department of
health policy at Mount Sinai Medical Center in New York City and
was on the panel that wrote the institute report.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, doctors depend more on findings from scientifically
controlled trials to provide quality medical care. The number of
such trials has surged beyond any doctor's ability to keep abreast,
rising to 10,000 a year now compared with about 100 in 1966,
according to Chassin's survey.
</P>
<P>
   Another reason for national attention to medical errors is that
the public has replaced paternalism with consumerism. It is a rare
scene today in which a family, told that a loved one died simply
because the patient could not withstand a procedure, accepts the
bad news without questioning the doctors and hospital staff.
</P>
<P>
   The challenge to medical authority has brought malpractice suits
and, as their number and costs have soared, a few pioneering
doctors looked to computers and the aviation industry, which uses
simulators for training, to develop ways to identify and prevent
errors.
</P>
<P>
   Anesthesiologists, for example, found that applying a simple
device to the skin to monitor oxygen levels during surgery could
sharply reduce the rate of death, brain damage and other
complications. Some hospitals are developing drills to be followed
before doctors and nurses start an operation, much like pilots'
using checklists before takeoff.
</P>
<P>
   In a number of hospitals, doctors now enter prescriptions and
other orders on computers to eliminate errors from illegible
handwriting. Clinton has urged greater use of bar code systems to
prevent potentially fatal transfusions from mismatched blood.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's plan is also based on a radical recent change in the
payment of health care. The government now pays for much of the
costs of medical care, research and education _ even in private
hospitals and managed care systems. Thus, the government can
collect information that could not have been obtained when medicine
was strictly a private enterprise.
</P>
<P>
   Because such findings have provided a glimpse into the
previously secret workings of medicine, and health care has become
so costly, many news organizations have increased their coverage of
health care issues and their watchdog role over them.
</P>
<P>
   For example, journalists have recently reported on a cluster of
highly visible horrendous medical errors at prestigious teaching
hospitals, including the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston,
Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York City and the
University of Chicago Hospitals. With reports of errors elsewhere
being added frequently, what may seem like a new epidemic is really
an old problem.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   An Achievable Goal
</P>
<P>
   Although many health experts quibble over the institute's
figures, most agree that medical errors, whatever the precise
number, can be reduced.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know there are preventable errors and that we should be
putting more energy and resources into preventing them,'' said Dr.
Nancy W. Dickey, the immediate past president of the American
Medical Association.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only acceptable error rate is zero, which means that as
long as there is an error rate above zero, we must continue putting
substantial effort into reducing the error rate still further,''
Dickey said. However, she said, the AMA has not set a target for
the lowest achievable error rate, in part because no one knows what
it is.
</P>
<P>
   New York and 17 other states now have mandatory systems for
reporting medical errors that vary in their policies and
thoroughness. The medical association does not want to dismantle
them, but does oppose their expansion, in part, because evidence is
lacking that mandatory reporting has reduced error rates.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we're not sure whether it works or how to make it work, why
create a costly new bureaucracy as Clinton plans to do,'' Dickey
said.
</P>
<P>
   Chassin agreed, saying: ``Unless you're prepared to send an army
of auditors in to verify the reporting, you can't be sure that the
reporting is equally reliable or thorough, and no state will
support that kind of effort.''
</P>
<P>
   Tackling errors, Dickey said, ``is such a huge problem that we
need to get our arms around pieces of it, make measurable progress,
and then add another piece rather than being so overwhelmed that we
don't know where to start.''
</P>
<P>
   Dickey said the medical association supported research efforts
to identify and then reduce the three most important types of
medical errors.
</P>
<P>
   In some cases, reporting is working to reduce errors. For
instance, New York state now achieves 97 percent survival rates
from coronary bypass surgery to rank highest among the states.
</P>
<P>
   Comparable improvement came from the five hospitals in Maine,
New Hampshire and Vermont that perform heart surgery and that
voluntarily cooperate to analyze their death rates.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration says that an increase in liability
has not been seen in states with mandatory reporting and contends
that reducing errors would decrease litigation.
</P>
<P>
   But the medical association said mandatory reporting could
``have the perverse result of driving errors underground.'' Doctors
also fear that information from frank discussions could become
grist for malpractice suits because written reports can be used by
plaintiffs' lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   Need to Define Errors
</P>
<P>
   One AMA objection to mandatory reporting is the lack of standard
definitions for different degrees of medical errors. Yet the
association did not develop such definitions before the institute's
report, and Dickey conceded in an interview that it would have been
wiser to have made it a priority. ``That's a valid point,'' Dickey
said.
</P>
<P>
   The Institute of Medicine borrowed from behavioral psychology to
define medical error very broadly as ``the failure of a planned
action to be completed as intended or the use of a wrong plan to
achieve an aim.''
</P>
<P>
   But the institute report focused mainly on medication errors. It
cited a small number of published studies in estimating that 7,000
patients died each year from medication errors.
</P>
<P>
   One definitional problem is that a certain number of
complications from drugs, surgery and other therapies are
unpredictable and not preventable. For example, a drug or operation
may have well-known complications, but often there is no way to
predict which people will get them. So when such a complication
occurs, is it an error?
</P>
<P>
   Classifying falls as errors, as the report did, is also a murky
area because they happen commonly in homes and on the street.
Doctors tend to take more responsibility for falls when they occur
in hospitals and nursing homes, where many can be related directly
to errors, like drug combinations that sedate too much or cause
fainting from dropping blood pressure.
</P>
<P>
   ``If elderly patients fall in a hospital and they might have
fallen at home, is that an error?'' Dickey asked. ``Probably not.
But if patients fell because they were sedated with medications so
their balance was impaired, that may be a potential error. If they
were sedated, the lights were all turned off so they were
disoriented, and the bed rails were not put up to discourage them
from walking, then you have several potential errors.''
</P>
<P>
   Although medicine prides itself on a tradition of exposing its
errors, at least internally, through self-scrutiny, ``we have not
met our ideals,'' said Dr. Kenneth M. Ludmerer, of Washington
University in St. Louis, the author of ``Time to Heal'' (Oxford
University Press, 1999), a history of American medical education
over the last century.
</P>
<P>
   The institute's report did not discuss the role of autopsies,
which had long been the profession's traditional tool for teaching
and quality control. But the autopsy rate has plummeted to the
current level of fewer than 10 percent of deaths in hospitals from
about 50 percent in the 1950s, in part because of the belief that
CT scans, MRI scans and other modern technology can accurately help
diagnose conditions during life. But studies have shown that
autopsies still often turn up surprises.
</P>
<P>
   Hospital conferences aimed at improving patient safety and that
are aided by autopsy findings have dropped in number and
attendance, lessening the profession's internal monitoring, critics
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's uncertainty in medicine,'' Ludmerer said, adding,
``We're misguided in doing fewer autopsies and we need to retain
our humility, learning from mistakes.''
</P>
<P>
   Medical leaders could have addressed many ways to reduce medical
errors before managed care magnified the problem, Ludmerer and
others said. The pressure to see 50 or so patients in a day and to
spend six or so minutes with each one is not enough time to say
hello.
</P>
<P>
   ``This ill-guided emphasis on doing things quickly, rather than
well, has certainly accentuated the problem of error,'' Ludmerer
said. ``You just make too many mistakes if you're doing things
quickly and have to cut corners.''

 BRIT GRIT: JANET McTEER'S UNLIKELY ROAD TO OSCAR NIGHT  
 (This ``separate buy'' article is from this week's StarBeat
entertainment package.) 
 (To publish this article, it must be purchased _ the rate is not
prohibitive _ from New York Times Syndicate sales representative
DEBRA WEYDERT at 732-390-4480, or by fax at 732-390-4697.) 
 (She also has information on how to subscribe to StarBeat, a weekly

 (Includes a color slide of Janet McTeer in a scene from
``Tumbleweeds.'') 
 By JEANNE WOLF  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features.)  
 &HT;    It's hard to miss Janet McTeer.
 &HT;    The statuesque, 6-foot-tall brunette would be an imposing figure
even without a vocabulary peppered with enough four-letter words to
make a sailor blush.
 &HT;    But the Academy Award-nominated star of ``Tumbleweeds'' laughs
heartily when told that the film's director, Gavin O'Connor, has
described her as ``a broad in the best sense of the word.''
 &HT;    ``I guess he means I swear a lot,'' McTeer say, grinning. ``I
don't pull any punches, and I'm not particularly girly. I say what
I think _ and I have a voice that sounds like I've just had a
bottle of whiskey and a pack of cigarettes.''
 &HT;    Nonetheless, she's irresistible. The British actress snared
Hollywood's attention by winning a 1998 Tony Award as the star of a
controversial, in-your-face adaptation of Ibsen's classic ``A
Doll's House.'' Then she captivated Academy voters as a single mom,
complete with Southern drawl, dragging her young daughter across
the country in search of love and new beginnings in
``Tumbleweeds.''
 &HT;    ``Mary Jo is attracted to men and she's very sexy,'' McTeer
says. ``I think she's been brought up to feel that she needs a man.
Unfortunately she ends up with the wrong guys, because the right
guys seem too boring.''
 &HT;    O'Connor spotted McTeer by chance, when she appeared on Charlie
Rose's PBS talk show during her Broadway run.
 &HT;    ``I tuned in by accident,'' he recalls in a separate interview.
``I envisioned I'd be watching this very proper, slightly pompous
English actress, and instead I saw this brassy and totally engaging
woman.
 &HT;    ``I thought, `My God, this is Mary Jo!'''
 &HT;    McTeer was smitten enough by the ``Tumbleweeds'' script _
written by O'Connor's ex-wife, Angela Shelton _ that she agreed to
star even though its financing was shaky at best.
 &HT;    The biggest challenge, of course, was mastering the character's
thick North Carolina accent _ not merely well enough to do it, but
so perfectly that she wouldn't have to think about it, leaving her
free to act.
 &HT;    ``I just wanted to be able to talk the talk and forget about
whether I was sounding right,'' she says. ``I worked very hard on
it. I also realized that American women have a different kind of
body language, a little more open and expressive than a Brit, so I
worked on that, too.''
 &HT;    To learn more, she joined Shelton for reconnoitering jaunts into
the North Carolina countryside.
 &HT;    ``I was sort of overwhelmed by all the space,'' she recalls.
``In Britain there isn't as much land, and there are a lot more
people on it. It's extraordinary to go to a place where they have a
big house with a porch, where they sit drinking whiskey sours or
whatever.''
 &HT;    Mary Jo's precocious 12-year-old daughter, Ava, is played by
14-year-old Kimberly Brown. In a separate interview, Brown reports
that she and McTeer clicked almost instantly.
 &HT;    ``I remember seeing this enormously tall woman as I sat down on
a couch with my script,'' Brown says, smiling. ``All of a sudden
she lunged on the couch and gave me a huge hug. I was sort of
freaking out _ and then we both started to laugh, and we made each
other laugh for the rest of the production.''
 &HT;    The two became inseparable, even though a ``swear box'' on the
set filled to overflowing with quarters, one for each curse word
the British actress let fly.
 &HT;    ``Every time Janet started talking,'' Brown says, rolling her
eyes, ``I had to do a double-take at what was coming out of the
mouth of this person from very proper Britain.''
 &HT;    Both actresses cite as their favorite scene a potentially
awkward one in which Mary Jo tries to tell her daughter how to use
a sanitary napkin.
 &HT;    ``It was completely improvised,'' McTeer recalls. ``We thought
of the most hilarious stuff, and we were literally rolling on the
floor with laughter.''
 &HT;    The only tension during production arose from Brown's determined
effort to convince McTeer to give up smoking.
 &HT;    ``Every single day she'd tell me I had to quit,'' McTeer says
with a sigh. ``It became unbelievably irritating, especially when
she started hiding my cigarettes. Finally it became clear that the
only thing that would save our friendship was if I stopped smoking
_ so I did.
 &HT;    ``I gave up last November, and I haven't had a cigarette
since.''
 &HT;    Mary Jo isn't everyone's idea of a great mother, hauling her
daughter away from their home in pursuit of a California dream and
often leaving her on her own while Mary Jo pursues her latest
boyfriend.
 &HT;    McTeer shrugs.
 &HT;    ``I think Mary Jo and Ava are best friends,'' she says. ``It
might seem like a dysfunctional relationship, but I saw it as
incredibly healthy. Both of us are trying to live our lives as best
we can _ fighting our way through it, loving our way through it and
coming out bigger and better people.''
 &HT;    Her performance as Mary Jo had people murmuring about an Oscar
even before the film was released, but McTeer says that she still
was thrown off-balance when she heard she'd been nominated.
 &HT;    ``I'm reminded of the Tony,'' she says, ``which was absolutely
terrifying because everyone was absolutely convinced I was going to
win it. Actually, about 30 people came over (from England) to the
ceremonies because they wanted to watch me win. I kept thinking,
`Jeez, if I don't get it, look at all the money these people will
have wasted on airline tickets.'
 &HT;    ``So, when I won the award, the only thing I honestly felt was
relief,'' she says. ``I was like, `Thank God, now I can have a
drink.'''
 &HT;    McTeer, who grew up in York and became interested in acting
through a job selling coffee at a local theater, says that the idea
of winning an Oscar never crossed her mind until recently.
 &HT;    ``The Academy Awards are so American that they aren't part of
the fantasy of a British kid,'' she says. ``When I started to work
as an actress, being nominated was the furthest thing from my mind.
Now I find it a little funny, to be quite honest.
 &HT;    ``I take it all with a bucket of salt _ which I guess is rather
British, isn't it?''
 &HT;    Any ``Tumbleweeds'' fan who catches McTeer's next couple of
films will find her hard to recognize as Mary Jo, the actress
promises.
 &HT;    ``I did `The King is Alive' in the Namibian desert,'' she says.
``It was sort of guerrilla filmmaking, with no lighting, no hair
and no make-up. It was very intense and very hot, but I found it
interesting.
 &HT;    ``Then I'm going to be back in North Carolina in `Song Catcher'
_ without a Southern accent,'' she says. ``I play a
turn-of-the-century Harvard professor.
 &HT;    ``The worst part was wearing a corset,'' she adds with a
grimace. ``It really changes your shape. I can understand why women
of that period used to faint all the time.''
 &HT;    Whether McTeer collects a golden statue or not, it isn't likely
to detract from the fun that the transplanted Brit is having making
American films.
 &HT;    ``I don't think about being a star,'' she says. ``In Hollywood
you can be a star because you're famous and not because you're
good. I think of stars like Judi Dench and Vanessa Redgrave who are
both. I never want to be famous for its own sake _ I want people to
like me for my work.
 &HT;    ``And, so far, I've managed to pay my rent.''

 &HT;    When Anjelica Huston calls ``Action!'' a formidable shadow hangs
over her.
 &HT;    After all, the Oscar-winning actress is the daughter of John
Huston, whose string of classic films includes ``The Maltese
Falcon'' (1941), ``The Treasure of the Sierra Madre'' (1948) and
``The African Queen'' (1951).
 &HT;    The great director, who died in 1987, remains a vivid presence
for his daughter. If she closes her eyes, she says, she can see him
immediately.
 &HT;    ``At first, I see the tallest man in the room, with the deepest
voice,'' Huston says. ``I see the man with the most charm. He's
playful. Ironic. Deeply intelligent. Challenging. Critical.
Darling.
 &HT;    ``I also have a later image of a much more frail man in a
wheelchair, hooked up to an oxygen tank,'' she adds, more soberly.
``And basically he's sort of furious that it all had to end this
way.''
 &HT;    As her brother Danny did years ago, Angelica Huston is following
in her father's footsteps as a director. Her first feature, ``Agnes
Brown,'' will open nationwide on March 3.
 &HT;    ``I learned about directing from watching my father,'' Huston
says. ``He is my influence _ I'm proud to be linked with him.''
 &HT;    In ``Agnes Brown,'' Huston plays the mother of seven children
growing up in rural Ireland in 1967, toiling to keep the family
together while longing for one extravagance _ a getaway to see her
favorite singer, Tom Jones. It's sweet, gentle and unabashedly
sentimental.
 &HT;    ``Obviously, sentimentality has a dirty connotation,'' Huston
says, settling in for an interview at New York's Regency Hotel.
``But I am sentimental about Ireland because I grew up there. I
also have a deep belief in Irish charm _ I have a deep belief in
the possibility of small miracles, which is what this film has at
its core.''
 &HT;    Originally Rosie O'Donnell was slated to play Agnes, with Huston
staying safely behind the camera.
 &HT;    ``And then she adopted another baby,'' the director says, ``and
I guess her work load was a bit too much. She backed out at the
last minute.
 &HT;    ``Believe me, it was not my first choice to have Miss Huston
star,'' she adds. ``I set out to direct this film, I didn't set out
to act in it. Doing both is too much work, too crazy. Not enough
time _ a nine-week schedule in which you act and direct seemed
preposterous to me.''
 &HT;    But as the film's start date loomed, she decided she had no
other choice.
 &HT;    ``If I had to go to other actresses, it would have been
prohibitive in terms of money and time,'' she says. ``I had to act
in the movie in order to save it.''
 &HT;    Not that she didn't relish the role, once she had it.
 &HT;    ``If I hadn't been directing, it would have been unlikely I
would have been offered this role,'' she admits. ``It's not very
often I'm offered benign parts where I play ordinary people with
real smiles.''
 &HT;    Huston based her performance on several people she knew as a
child.
 &HT;    ``She's based on my Irish nanny Kathleen Shine,'' she says.
``And my mother, of course. Also there was another woman, the wife
of the man who looked after my father's horses, who lived on our
estate. She was the mother of seven.''
 &HT;    Many who worked with John Huston have commented on his brusque
directorial style, but his daughter says his reputation was
somewhat misleading.
 &HT;    ``My father certainly didn't direct with bombast,'' she says.
``He was very, very quiet and quite deadly. If he didn't like what
you were doing, you could expect to be there for the rest of the
week doing the same scene.
 &HT;    ``If he liked what you were doing,'' she adds, ``he would very
calmly say, `You got it. Let's move along.' I never saw him raise
his voice on set. I never saw him wave his arms.''
 &HT;    For herself, Huston says, she takes a considerably different
approach.
 &HT;    ``I'm the kind of director who smiles at her actors,'' she says.
``I'm touchy-feely _ I hug everyone in the morning. I think it's
important to the work that you develop strong friendships on a
movie set. In my experience, that's what makes it possible for
people to give more.
 &HT;    ``You have to create an atmosphere of trust.''
 &HT;    Raised in Ireland as the daughter of the director and his fourth
wife, ballerina Enrica Soma _ with whom he split when she was 11 _
Huston was only 15 when she decided she wanted to be an actress.
 &HT;    ``At first I didn't want to work with my father,'' she recalls.
``I wanted to work with practically anyone else on earth. I wanted
to be free and not have the hardship of parental control.''
 &HT;    In particular, she wanted the lead in Franco Zeffirelli's
``Romeo and Juliet'' (1968).
 &HT;    ``Franco Zeffirelli was looking for his girl at my school,'' she
recalls, ``and I wanted very much to be in that movie. My father
ended up writing Zeffirelli a letter saying I shouldn't be
considered, because I was going to make a film with him.''
 &HT;    Huston was devastated. It didn't help that her film debut _
other than a bit part in her father's ``Sinful Davey'' (1969) _
turned out to be ``A Walk with Love and Death'' (1969), one of his
worst films.
 &HT;    ``It was not a happy experience,'' she says. ``I wasn't in love
with the script. And my father's reaction was, `Who do you think
you are, Katharine Hepburn?'
 &HT;    ``The whole thing made me withdraw from acting for several
years.''
 &HT;    She wouldn't work with her father again for 16 years, by which
time she had established herself as an actress in her own right.
Their professional reunion was the far better ``Prizzi's Honor''
(1985), which won Huston an Oscar as Best Supporting Actress for
her role as a conniving Mafia princess.
 &HT;    She later appeared in her father's final film, ``The Dead''
(1987), and earned Oscar nominations for ``Enemies, a Love Story''
(1989) and ``The Grifters'' (1990). To many, however, she's best
known as Morticia Addams in ``The Addams Family'' (1991) and
``Addams Family Values'' (1993).
 &HT;    Huston's directorial debut was nearly as troubled as her acting
debut. ``Bastard Out of Carolina'' (1996) was filmed for Ted
Turner's TNT cable network. Its controversial treatment of child
molestation and rape drew criticism, however, and after viewing the
finished film Turner personally canceled the project.
 &HT;    ``I never expected that its parent company would reject it,''
Huston says. ``Of course, they had seen dailies every day. I don't
know if Ted Turner was looking very carefully at his properties at
the time. I don't know if he was fully aware of the subject matter
of `Bastard Out of Carolina.'''
 &HT;    Huston shrugs.
 &HT;    ``The contract says it's his film,'' she says. ``If it's his
choice not to show it, so be it. As it was, I was invited to Cannes
with the film. It got seen, it got reviewed. It enjoyed quite a
success.''
 &HT;    The film was eventually purchased by Showtime and shown in its
original form.
 &HT;    ``If it hadn't been seen at all,'' Huston says, ``I would have
been a lot more bitter about it.''
 &HT;    It certainly didn't frighten her off from directing, but for now
she has other things on her mind.
 &HT;    ``I'm happy because this movie is done and I'm off on a Jamaican
vacation with my women friends next week,'' Huston says, laughing.
``I haven't had a vacation in years.
 &HT;    ``I can't wait to get away and not even think about movies
anymore.''

NEVE CAMPBELL: THE `PARTY' IS OVER, AND SHE FEELS FINE

 (Includes a color slide of Neve Campbell in a scene from ``Drowning
Mona.'') 
 By IAN SPELLING  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features.)  
 &HT;    Neve Campbell was terrified.
 &HT;    No, she wasn't getting threatening telephone calls from a guy
with a creepy voice. No black-clad sicko was chasing her with a
knife.
 &HT;    Actually, what had the ``Party of Five'' star thinking twice was
the script of her new movie, ``Drowning Mona.'' Its touchy blend of
black humor and satire was scarier than anything she faced as
Sidney Prescott in three ``Scream'' films.
 &HT;    ``It's always scary to try new things,'' Campbell says. ``You
hope you'll be able to pull it off. On the other hand, I'm really
trying to do that, to try different things, to challenge myself and
grow as an actor.
 &HT;    ``If I'm not willing to take risks, then I might as well stop
now.''
 &HT;    Campbell co-stars with Danny DeVito, Bette Midler, Jamie Lee
Curtis and Casey Affleck in ``Drowning Mona,'' due for release on
March 3. It's an offbeat story set in Verplanck, N.Y., where
everyone drives Yugos and no one seems to care much about the death
of Mona Dearly (Midler).
 &HT;    Her character, Ellen Rash, isn't much like the real-life
Campbell. Where the actress wears her straight, brown hair pulled
back and looks great in a simple gray sweater-and-skirt combo,
Ellen sports hideous hair and a closetful of fashion-don't clothes.
 &HT;    Another difference: Campbell is a smart, worldly and sensible
26-year-old, while Ellen is ... well, let's just say that she isn't
the sharpest pencil in the drawer.
 &HT;    ``The character is absolutely ridiculous,'' Campbell says during
a conversation at New York's Essex House. ``The film itself is
absurd. I read the script and thought, `I have to do this.'
 &HT;    ``So I just decided to be as silly and ridiculous as possible,''
she says. ``I've done comedy in the past, but usually as the
straight man.''
 &HT;    The experience of making the film was both exhilarating and
unnerving, the young actress reports.
 &HT;    ``It was intimidating,'' she says, ``because you're working at
comedy with a bunch of people who have done many comedies in the
past and been very successful at it.
 &HT;    ``But it was also freeing, because I was laughing my head off
the whole time,'' she says. ``With that kind of character, you have
to not be concerned about how you're going to come across. You just
have to commit to it, do it and hopefully it will work.
 &HT;    ``It's like shooting in the dark.''
 &HT;    That kind of gamble doesn't come easily to the thoughtful,
ambitious Canadian actress who, even as she was making a name for
herself as ``Party of Five's'' put-upon Julia Salinger, was already
pondering the often-treacherous transition from television to film.
 &HT;    From her debut role in the surprise-hit supernatural thriller
``The Craft'' (1996) through the slasher movie/self-referential
comedy ``Scream'' (1996) and its two sequels, as well as the
noirish thriller ``Wild Things'' (1998), in which she played a
sluttish, machiavellian social outcast, Campbell has always had a
plan in mind.
 &HT;    ``It was really important for me to start looking for scripts
even for my first hiatus,'' she says, tugging on her sweater. ``For
me, what I had to focus on was my acting. I've tried to find things
that are different from Julia.
 &HT;    ``My first character in a feature was the girl in `The Craft,'''
Campbell says. ``She was interesting, and she had issues. Sidney is
much stronger than Julia in a lot of ways, though still messed up.
That's why it was important for me to do Suzie Toller in `Wild
Things' _ I played something on the other extreme.
 &HT;    ``Each time I do a project, I'm very concerned about not doing
the same thing the next time around.''
 &HT;    The only exceptions, of course, were her appearances in ``Scream
2'' (1998) and ``Scream 3'' (2000).
 &HT;    ``It was a very difficult decision,'' she says of the latest
installment. ``The very reason a sequel is made is because the
first one was so fantastic or people loved it so much. To think you
can possibly stand up to what that was is a huge challenge _
especially because Kevin Williamson didn't write `Scream 3.'
 &HT;    ``When I knew Wes Craven was going to be there and the cast
would be there, that it would be the last one and a nice way to
finish it, then I was willing to do it.''
 &HT;    Though ``Scream 3'' killed at the box office, taking in more
than $75 million in its first few weeks, all involved are still
insisting that this was the final go-round for the still-potent
franchise.
 &HT;    Speaking of endings, the actress has also decided to depart
``Party of Five'' at the end of this season, whether or not Fox
decides to renew the long-running series, whose ratings have
slipped in recent months.
 &HT;    ``It's bittersweet,'' she says quietly. ``I've spent 15 hours a
day, five days a week, for six years with these people on `Party of
Five.' I've spent more time being Julia than being myself in a lot
of ways, which is frightening.
 &HT;    ``So I am sad to see it go,'' she admits. ``It is the reason I
came to the States. It's why my face got out there. It's been great
for me _ it's been a great way for me to work my muscles every day
as an actor, which not many people get to do.''
 &HT;    She feels much the same way about the ``Scream'' series _ happy
to have done it, even if she's also happy to be able to move on.
 &HT;    ``I've had a blast,'' Campbell says. ``We just have so much fun
together on those films. So I am sad to say goodbye to them, but
I'm also really excited about new opportunities and growing and
staying inspired.''
 &HT;    And getting some rest, adds the actress, who politely declines
comment on her relationship with actor John Cusack, but waxes
enthusiastic about a recent vacation in Hawaii and her current
mission to learn Spanish.
 &HT;    ``I will definitely slow down,'' Campbell says. ``My schedule
can't ever be as hard as it has been for the last six years,
because I won't be doing nine months of a television show and then
at least two movies at hiatus.''
 &HT;    Well, maybe and maybe not. After all, Campbell has already
completed ``Panic,'' co-starring William H. Macy. And, only 10 days
after wrapping production on ``Party of Five,'' she'll jet off to
Berlin to star with Nick Nolte in Alan Rudolph's drama
``Investigating Sex.''
 &HT;    ``What I'd like is just to do films and to be able to choose my
scripts and take time off,'' Campbell says, smiling. ``I think it
will be easier to spend time with myself.
 &HT;    ``So I'm scared and I'm excited about the opportunities,'' she
concludes. ``I hope it will work out.''

 EDITORS: Note possibly offensive language in final paragraph. 
 (Includes a color slide of Calista Flockhart in a scene from ``Ally
McBeal.'') 
 By CATHERINE DAWSON  
 c.2000 TV Guide Canada  
 Not to be released in Canada before March 12, 2000. 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features.)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   In Hollywood, where image is everything, the latest formula for
actresses seems to be: Skinny  &QC;  Stardom.
</P>
<P>
   Stick-figure celebrities are all over the big and small screens,
and we've watched their weights drop until their bones show
through. The roster includes Jennifer Aniston and Courteney Cox
Arquette on ``Friends'' and ``Ally McBeal's'' Calista Flockhart.
Debra Messing of ``Will &AMP; Grace,'' Paula Devicq of ``Party of
Five'' and Lara Flynn Boyle of ``The Practice'' are often
punchlines in late-night monologues. ``Frasier's'' English beauty,
Jane Leeves, has noticeably lost inches, as have Helen Hunt and
Gwyneth Paltrow.
</P>
<P>
   Incredibly, size-four comedian Kathy Griffin of ``Suddenly
Susan'' felt she had to undergo a liposuction operation that ended
in an allergic reaction to an anesthetic and a bladder infection.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I lost,'' Griffin told Glamour magazine, ``was about
$6,000.''
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, there's more to this trend than skewed aesthetics
or celebrity follies. These superthin actresses are role models to
their fans, especially teen-age and pre-teen girls, whose yearning
to emulate their idols can result in serious, even life-threatening
eating disorders.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's always been a beauty ideal that people have strived
toward,'' says Barb Callaghan, assistant program director at the
National Eating Disorder Information Centre in Toronto. ``We do set
a certain value on being thin and what thinness means. If you look
at the media, they perpetuate that. Thinness is success. Thinness
is beautiful.''
</P>
<P>
   Fashion magazines are the worst offenders, Callaghan adds, but
films and television aren't far behind.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the Hollywood industry you have to look a certain way to
get the parts,'' she says. ``It's a standard that's been set.''
</P>
<P>
   The pressure is toughest on actresses struggling to land that
first big break.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard when you find out you didn't get a job because you
weren't pretty or thin enough,'' says Sarah Paulson of ``Jack &AMP;
Jill.'' ``I want them to put me in that movie _ do I conform to
what their form of beauty is, or do I stick to my own guns?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really hard _ you fluctuate back and forth.''
</P>
<P>
   Needless to say, male actors don't face nearly the same
challenge. They may feel pressured to ``look the part,'' but it's
not a career-killer for a man to be overweight _ he can even earn
slightly tongue-in-cheek status as a sex symbol.
</P>
<P>
   When ``NYPD Blue's'' 235-pound Dennis Franz bared his behind in
a 1994 episode, the media hype was deafening. But how many
235-pound female's butts will television viewers ever see?
</P>
<P>
   On doctor's advice, Franz shed about 35 pounds last year, yet he
says his low-carbohydrate diet nonetheless allows him to eat ``vats
of Jell-O and whipped cream.'' It's a rare quote to read in a diet
story, and unimaginable in one about a female star.
</P>
<P>
   One of the rare venues where talent triumphs over dress size is
the ratings-challenged sitcom ``Veronica's Closet.'' Its two leads,
Kirstie Alley and Kathy Najimy, are women who unashamedly have real
meat on their bones.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the show's funniest scenes have belonged to Najimy, who
often speaks out against the only-thin-is-beautiful ideal. Earlier
this year she put her body where her belief was, modeling
plus-sized lingerie for a New York fashion show.
</P>
<P>
   The standard bearer for a more inclusive definition of beauty
is, of course, ``The Practice's'' Camryn Manheim. Her ``fat girls''
acceptance speech at the 1998 Emmy Awards quickly become the stuff
of Hollywood legend, and her autobiography, ``Wake Up, I'm Fat''
(Broadway Books, 1999), is a virtual manifesto for her cause.
</P>
<P>
   Still, she feels that even now her size hampers her career
opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as a leading movie role and making it romantic,'' she
says, ``I don't see that around the bend anytime soon.''
</P>
<P>
   Guys have it easier, especially on the small screen. One key
story line on ``The Drew Carey Show'' is the sexual tension between
beer-bellied Carey and his svelte girlfriend Kate (Christa Miller).
The characters reportedly will consummate their relationship in a
much-hyped episode later this season.
</P>
<P>
   Manheim notes, however, that while a woman who by female
standards was as large as Carey would rarely be viewed as
attractive, even he is subject to an arbitrary standard of beauty.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he had fatty breasts, that would not be right,'' Manheim
says. ``Men with beer guts aren't considered fat, but men with
breasts are considered fat _ it's like a masculine and feminine
thing.''
</P>
<P>
   As far as a lot of actors are concerned, the media is as
responsible for the cult of thinness as any producer or casting
director.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole thing has gotten out of hand this past year,'' says
Michael Badaluco, the tall, stocky co-star of ``The Practice.''
``All you read about in magazines or tabloids is whether this
actress is anorexic. I guess it sells magazines.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of it should really be people's private business.''
</P>
<P>
   Sensational stories about too-skinny stars do sell, however, and
there's not much that the actresses themselves can do about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have control over what people write,'' Cox Arquette
says. ``If they say we're too thin, I can't take responsibility for
that. I happen to like the way I am _ or maybe I don't, but that's
nobody else's business.''
</P>
<P>
   Aniston, who has experienced a full-court media press because of
her relationship with Brad Pitt, says that all a performer can do
is to try to ignore the tabloid stories.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once you realize that these are people doing a job and they
have to put entertainment in magazines, you can take things less
personally, the good and the bad,'' she says. ``You realize it's
only one guy in a room writing something to make you feel bad. One
guy.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has the ability and he knows that _ that's his little
thrill for the day.''
</P>
<P>
   It's harder to ignore direct questions during interviews.
</P>
<P>
   ``Am I anorexic? Am I bulimic? I get that question all the
time,'' says Jaime Pressley of ``Jack &AMP; Jill.''
</P>
<P>
   Pressley started her career as a dancer and gymnast, but says
she couldn't find work as an actress until she lost the thick
muscle in her legs and torso.
</P>
<P>
   ``The day I did press interviews,'' she recalls, ``I had 80
people in a row ask me if I was anorexic, why I was so thin. Why am
I losing all this weight? Do I think I need to? Am I eating? What
do I eat?''
</P>
<P>
   She motions to her baggy sweater and loose-fitting khakis.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why I dress this way _ I'm so tired of it,'' she says.
``I couldn't be more sick of people looking at my body and telling
me I'm too thin.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not about who's got a beautiful ass or a scrawny ass.
It's because I can act.''

 (Includes a color slide of Janet McTeer in a scene from

 By JEANNE WOLF  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features.)  
 &HT;    It's hard to miss Janet McTeer.
 &HT;    The statuesque, 6-foot-tall brunette would be an imposing figure
even without a vocabulary peppered with enough four-letter words to
make a sailor blush.
 &HT;    But the Academy Award-nominated star of ``Tumbleweeds'' laughs
heartily when told that the film's director, Gavin O'Connor, has
described her as ``a broad in the best sense of the word.''
 &HT;    ``I guess he means I swear a lot,'' McTeer say, grinning. ``I
don't pull any punches, and I'm not particularly girly. I say what
I think _ and I have a voice that sounds like I've just had a
bottle of whiskey and a pack of cigarettes.''
 &HT;    Nonetheless, she's irresistible. The British actress snared
Hollywood's attention by winning a 1998 Tony Award as the star of a
controversial, in-your-face adaptation of Ibsen's classic ``A
Doll's House.'' Then she captivated Academy voters as a single mom,
complete with Southern drawl, dragging her young daughter across
the country in search of love and new beginnings in
``Tumbleweeds.''
 &HT;    ``Mary Jo is attracted to men and she's very sexy,'' McTeer
says. ``I think she's been brought up to feel that she needs a man.
Unfortunately she ends up with the wrong guys, because the right
guys seem too boring.''
 &HT;    O'Connor spotted McTeer by chance, when she appeared on Charlie
Rose's PBS talk show during her Broadway run.
 &HT;    ``I tuned in by accident,'' he recalls in a separate interview.
``I envisioned I'd be watching this very proper, slightly pompous
English actress, and instead I saw this brassy and totally engaging
woman.
 &HT;    ``I thought, `My God, this is Mary Jo!'''
 &HT;    McTeer was smitten enough by the ``Tumbleweeds'' script _
written by O'Connor's ex-wife, Angela Shelton _ that she agreed to
star even though its financing was shaky at best.
 &HT;    The biggest challenge, of course, was mastering the character's
thick North Carolina accent _ not merely well enough to do it, but
so perfectly that she wouldn't have to think about it, leaving her
free to act.
 &HT;    ``I just wanted to be able to talk the talk and forget about
whether I was sounding right,'' she says. ``I worked very hard on
it. I also realized that American women have a different kind of
body language, a little more open and expressive than a Brit, so I
worked on that, too.''
 &HT;    To learn more, she joined Shelton for reconnoitering jaunts into
the North Carolina countryside.
 &HT;    ``I was sort of overwhelmed by all the space,'' she recalls.
``InBritain there isn't as much land, and there are a lot more
people on it. It's extraordinary to go to a place where they have a
big house with a porch, where they sit drinking whiskey sours or
whatever.''
 &HT;    Mary Jo's precocious 12-year-old daughter, Ava, is played by
14-year-old Kimberly Brown. In a separate interview, Brown reports
that she and McTeer clicked almost instantly.
 &HT;    ``I remember seeing this enormously tall woman as I sat down on
a couch with my script,'' Brown says, smiling. ``All of a sudden
she lunged on the couch and gave me a huge hug. I was sort of
freaking out _ and then we both started to laugh, and we made each
other laugh for the rest of the production.''
 &HT;    The two became inseparable, even though a ``swear box'' on the
set filled to overflowing with quarters, one for each curse word
the British actress let fly.
 &HT;    ``Every time Janet started talking,'' Brown says, rolling her
eyes, ``I had to do a double-take at what was coming out of the
mouth of this person from very proper Britain.''
 &HT;    Both actresses cite as their favorite scene a potentially
awkward one in which Mary Jo tries to tell her daughter how to use
a sanitary napkin.
 &HT;    ``It was completely improvised,'' McTeer recalls. ``We thought
of the most hilarious stuff, and we were literally rolling on the
floor with laughter.''
 &HT;    The only tension during production arose from Brown's determined
effort to convince McTeer to give up smoking.
 &HT;    ``Every single day she'd tell me I had to quit,'' McTeer says
with a sigh. ``It became unbelievably irritating, especially when
she started hiding my cigarettes. Finally it became clear that the
only thing that would save our friendship was if I stopped smoking
_ so I did.
 &HT;    ``I gave up last November, and I haven't had a cigarette
since.''
 &HT;    Mary Jo isn't everyone's idea of a great mother, hauling her
daughter away from their home in pursuit of a California dream and
often leaving her on her own while Mary Jo pursues her latest
boyfriend.
 &HT;    McTeer shrugs.
 &HT;    ``I think Mary Jo and Ava are best friends,'' she says. ``It
might seem like a dysfunctional relationship, but I saw it as
incredibly healthy. Both of us are trying to live our lives as best
we can _ fighting our way through it, loving our way through it and
coming out bigger and better people.''
 &HT;    Her performance as Mary Jo had people murmuring about an Oscar
even before the film was released, but McTeer says that she still
was thrown off-balance when she heard she'd been nominated.
 &HT;    ``I'm reminded of the Tony,'' she says, ``which was absolutely
terrifying because everyone was absolutely convinced I was going to
win it. Actually, about 30 people came over (from England) to the
ceremonies because they wanted to watch me win. I kept thinking,
`Jeez, if I don't get it, look at all the money these people will
have wasted on airline tickets.'
 &HT;    ``So, when I won the award, the only thing I honestly felt was
relief,'' she says. ``I was like, `Thank God, now I can have a
drink.'''
 &HT;    McTeer, who grew up in York and became interested in acting
through a job selling coffee at a local theater, says that the idea
of winning an Oscar never crossed her mind until recently.
 &HT;    ``The Academy Awards are so American that they aren't part of
the fantasy of a British kid,'' she says. ``When I started to work
as an actress, being nominated was the furthest thing from my mind.
Now I find it a little funny, to be quite honest.
 &HT;    ``I take it all with a bucket of salt _ which I guess is rather
British, isn't it?''
 &HT;    Any ``Tumbleweeds'' fan who catches McTeer's next couple of
films will find her hard to recognize as Mary Jo, the actress
promises.
 &HT;    ``I did `The King is Alive' in the Namibian desert,'' she says.
``It was sort of guerrilla filmmaking, with no lighting, no hair
and no make-up. It was very intense and very hot, but I found it
interesting.
 &HT;    ``Then I'm going to be back in North Carolina in `Song Catcher'
_ without a Southern accent,'' she says. ``I play a
turn-of-the-century Harvard professor.
 &HT;    ``The worst part was wearing a corset,'' she adds with a
grimace. ``It really changes your shape. I can understand why women
of that period used to faint all the time.''
 &HT;    Whether McTeer collects a golden statue or not, it isn't likely
to detract from the fun that the transplanted Brit is having making
American films.
 &HT;    ``I don't think about being a star,'' she says. ``In Hollywood
you can be a star because you're famous and not because you're
good. I think of stars like Judi Dench and Vanessa Redgrave who are
both. I never want to be famous for its own sake _ I want people to
like me for my work.
 &HT;    ``And, so far, I've managed to pay my rent.''

ANJELICA HUSTON, DIRECTING IN A GIANT SHADOW 
</HEADLINE>
  (This ``separate buy'' article is from this week's StarBeat
entertainment package.) 
 (To publish this article, it must be purchased _ the rate is not

 (Includes a color slide of Anjelica Huston with Marion O'Dwyer in a
scene from ``Agnes Browne.'') 
 By CINDY PEARLMAN  
 World rights except Chicago. 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features.)  
 &HT;    When Anjelica Huston calls ``Action!'' a formidable shadow hangs
over her.
 &HT;    After all, the Oscar-winning actress is the daughter of John
Huston, whose string of classic films includes ``The Maltese
Falcon'' (1941), ``The Treasure of the Sierra Madre'' (1948) and
``The African Queen'' (1951).
 &HT;    The great director, who died in 1987, remains a vivid presence
for his daughter. If she closes her eyes, she says, she can see him
immediately.
 &HT;    ``At first, I see the tallest man in the room, with the deepest
voice,'' Huston says. ``I see the man with the most charm. He's
playful. Ironic. Deeply intelligent. Challenging. Critical.
Darling.
 &HT;    ``I also have a later image of a much more frail man in a
wheelchair, hooked up to an oxygen tank,'' she adds, more soberly.
``And basically he's sort of furious that it all had to end this
way.''
 &HT;    As her brother Danny did years ago, Angelica Huston is following
in her father's footsteps as a director. Her first feature, ``Agnes
Brown,'' will open nationwide on March 3.
 &HT;    ``I learned about directing from watching my father,'' Huston
says. ``He is my influence _ I'm proud to be linked with him.''
 &HT;    In ``Agnes Brown,'' Huston plays the mother of seven children
growing up in rural Ireland in 1967, toiling to keep the family
together while longing for one extravagance _ a getaway to see her
favorite singer, Tom Jones. It's sweet, gentle and unabashedly
sentimental.
 &HT;    ``Obviously, sentimentality has a dirty connotation,'' Huston
says, settling in for an interview at New York's Regency Hotel.
``But I am sentimental about Ireland because I grew up there. I
also have a deep belief in Irish charm _ I have a deep belief in
the possibility of small miracles, which is what this film has at
its core.''
 &HT;    Originally Rosie O'Donnell was slated to play Agnes, with Huston
staying safely behind the camera.
 &HT;    ``And then she adopted another baby,'' the director says, ``and
I guess her work load was a bit too much. She backed out at the
last minute.
 &HT;    ``Believe me, it was not my first choice to have Miss Huston
star,'' she adds. ``I set out to direct this film, I didn't set out
to act in it. Doing both is too much work, too crazy. Not enough
time _ a nine-week schedule in which you act and direct seemed
preposterous to me.''
 &HT;    But as the film's start date loomed, she decided she had no
other choice.
 &HT;    ``If I had to go to other actresses, it would have been
prohibitive in terms of money and time,'' she says. ``I had to act
in the movie in order to save it.''
 &HT;    Not that she didn't relish the role, once she had it.
 &HT;    ``If I hadn't been directing, it would have been unlikely I
would have been offered this role,'' she admits. ``It's not very
often I'm offered benign parts where I play ordinary people with
real smiles.''
 &HT;    Huston based her performance on several people she knew as a
child.
 &HT;    ``She's based on my Irish nanny Kathleen Shine,'' she says.
``And my mother, of course. Also there was another woman, the wife
of the man who looked after my father's horses, who lived on our
estate. She was the mother of seven.''
 &HT;    Many who worked with John Huston have commented on his brusque
directorial style, but his daughter says his reputation was
somewhat misleading.
 &HT;    ``My father certainly didn't direct with bombast,'' she says.
``He was very, very quiet and quite deadly. If he didn't like what
you were doing, you could expect to be there for the rest of the
week doing the same scene.
 &HT;    ``If he liked what you were doing,'' she adds, ``he would very
calmly say, `You got it. Let's move along.' I never saw him raise
his voice on set. I never saw him wave his arms.''
 &HT;    For herself, Huston says, she takes a considerably different
approach.
 &HT;    ``I'm the kind of director who smiles at her actors,'' she says.
``I'm touchy-feely _ I hug everyone in the morning. I think it's
important to the work that you develop strong friendships on a
movie set. In my experience, that's what makes it possible for
people to give more.
 &HT;    ``You have to create an atmosphere of trust.''
 &HT;    Raised in Ireland as the daughter of the director and his fourth
wife, ballerina Enrica Soma _ with whom he split when she was 11 _
Huston was only 15 when she decided she wanted to be an actress.
 &HT;    ``At first I didn't want to work with my father,'' she recalls.
``I wanted to work with practically anyone else on earth. I wanted
to be free and not have the hardship of parental control.''
 &HT;    In particular, she wanted the lead in Franco Zeffirelli's
``Romeo and Juliet'' (1968).
 &HT;    ``Franco Zeffirelli was looking for his girl at my school,'' she
recalls, ``and I wanted very much to be in that movie. My father
ended up writing Zeffirelli a letter saying I shouldn't be
considered, because I was going to make a film with him.''
 &HT;    Huston was devastated. It didn't help that her film debut _
other than a bit part in her father's ``Sinful Davey'' (1969) _
turned out to be ``A Walk with Love and Death'' (1969), one of his
worst films.
 &HT;    ``It was not a happy experience,'' she says. ``I wasn't in love
with the script. And my father's reaction was, `Who do you think
you are, Katharine Hepburn?'
 &HT;    ``The whole thing made me withdraw from acting for several
years.''
 &HT;    She wouldn't work with her father again for 16 years, by which
time she had established herself as an actress in her own right.
Their professional reunion was the far better ``Prizzi's Honor''
(1985), which won Huston an Oscar as Best Supporting Actress for
her role as a conniving Mafia princess.
 &HT;    She later appeared in her father's final film, ``The Dead''
(1987), and earned Oscar nominations for ``Enemies, a Love Story''
(1989) and ``The Grifters'' (1990). To many, however, she's best
known as Morticia Addams in ``The Addams Family'' (1991) and
``Addams Family Values'' (1993).
 &HT;    Huston's directorial debut was nearly as troubled as her acting
debut. ``Bastard Out of Carolina'' (1996) was filmed for Ted
Turner's TNT cable network. Its controversial treatment of child
molestation and rape drew criticism, however, and after viewing the
finished film Turner personally canceled the project.
 &HT;    ``I never expected that its parent company would reject it,''
Huston says. ``Of course, they had seen dailies every day. I don't
know if Ted Turner was looking very carefully at his properties at
the time. I don't know if he was fully aware of the subject matter
of `Bastard Out of Carolina.'''
 &HT;    Huston shrugs.
 &HT;    ``The contract says it's his film,'' she says. ``If it's his
choice not to show it, so be it. As it was, I was invited to Cannes
with the film. It got seen, it got reviewed. It enjoyed quite a
success.''
 &HT;    The film was eventually purchased by Showtime and shown in its
original form.
 &HT;    ``If it hadn't been seen at all,'' Huston says, ``I would have
been a lot more bitter about it.''
 &HT;    It certainly didn't frighten her off from directing, but for now
she has other things on her mind.
 &HT;    ``I'm happy because this movie is done and I'm off on a Jamaican
vacation with my women friends next week,'' Huston says, laughing.
``I haven't had a vacation in years.
 &HT;    ``I can't wait to get away and not even think about movies
anymore.''

NEVE CAMPBELL: THE `PARTY' IS OVER, AND SHE FEELS FINE 
</HEADLINE>
  (This ``separate buy'' article is from this week's StarBeat
entertainment package.) 
 (To publish this article, it must be purchased _ the rate is not
prohibitive _ from New York Times Syndicate sales representative
DEBRA WEYDERT at 732-390-4480, or by fax at 732-390-4697.) 
 (She also has information on how to subscribe to StarBeat, a weekly

 (Includes a color slide of Neve Campbell in a scene from ``Drowning
Mona.'') 
 By IAN SPELLING  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features.)  
 &HT;    Neve Campbell was terrified.
 &HT;    No, she wasn't getting threatening telephone calls from a guy
with a creepy voice. No black-clad sicko was chasing her with a
knife.
 &HT;    Actually, what had the ``Party of Five'' star thinking twice was
the script of her new movie, ``Drowning Mona.'' Its touchy blend of
black humor and satire was scarier than anything she faced as
Sidney Prescott in three ``Scream'' films.
 &HT;    ``It's always scary to try new things,'' Campbell says. ``You
hope you'll be able to pull it off. On the other hand, I'm really
trying to do that, to try different things, to challenge myself and
grow as an actor.
 &HT;    ``If I'm not willing to take risks, then I might as well stop
now.''
 &HT;    Campbell co-stars with Danny DeVito, Bette Midler, Jamie Lee
Curtis and Casey Affleck in ``Drowning Mona,'' due for release on
March 3. It's an offbeat story set in Verplanck, N.Y., where
everyone drives Yugos and no one seems to care much about the death
of Mona Dearly (Midler).
 &HT;    Her character, Ellen Rash, isn't much like the real-life
Campbell. Where the actress wears her straight, brown hair pulled
back and looks great in a simple gray sweater-and-skirt combo,
Ellen sports hideous hair and a closetful of fashion-don't clothes.
 &HT;    Another difference: Campbell is a smart, worldly and sensible
26-year-old, while Ellen is ... well, let's just say that she isn't
the sharpest pencil in the drawer.
 &HT;    ``The character is absolutely ridiculous,'' Campbell says during
a conversation at New York's Essex House. ``The film itself is
absurd. I read the script and thought, `I have to do this.'
 &HT;    ``So I just decided to be as silly and ridiculous as possible,''
she says. ``I've done comedy in the past, but usually as the
straight man.''
 &HT;    The experience of making the film was both exhilarating and
unnerving, the young actress reports.
 &HT;    ``It was intimidating,'' she says, ``because you're working at
comedy with a bunch of people who have done many comedies in the
past and been very successful at it.
 &HT;    ``But it was also freeing, because I was laughing my head off
the whole time,'' she says. ``With that kind of character, you have
to not be concerned about how you're going to come across. You just
have to commit to it, do it and hopefully it will work.
 &HT;    ``It's like shooting in the dark.''
 &HT;    That kind of gamble doesn't come easily to the thoughtful,
ambitious Canadian actress who, even as she was making a name for
herself as ``Party of Five's'' put-upon Julia Salinger, was already
pondering the often-treacherous transition from television to film.
 &HT;    From her debut role in the surprise-hit supernatural thriller
``The Craft'' (1996) through the slasher movie/self-referential
comedy ``Scream'' (1996) and its two sequels, as well as the
noirish thriller ``Wild Things'' (1998), in which she played a
sluttish, machiavellian social outcast, Campbell has always had a
plan in mind.
 &HT;    ``It was really important for me to start looking for scripts
even for my first hiatus,'' she says, tugging on her sweater. ``For
me, what I had to focus on was my acting. I've tried to find things
that are different from Julia.
 &HT;    ``My first character in a feature was the girl in `The Craft,'''
Campbell says. ``She was interesting, and she had issues. Sidney is
much stronger than Julia in a lot of ways, though still messed up.
That's why it was important for me to do Suzie Toller in `Wild
Things' _ I played something on the other extreme.
 &HT;    ``Each time I do a project, I'm very concerned about not doing
the same thing the next time around.''
 &HT;    The only exceptions, of course, were her appearances in ``Scream
2'' (1998) and ``Scream 3'' (2000).
 &HT;    ``It was a very difficult decision,'' she says of the latest
installment. ``The very reason a sequel is made is because the
first one was so fantastic or people loved it so much. To think you
can possibly stand up to what that was is a huge challenge _
especially because Kevin Williamson didn't write `Scream 3.'
 &HT;    ``When I knew Wes Craven was going to be there and the cast
would be there, that it would be the last one and a nice way to
finish it, then I was willing to do it.''
 &HT;    Though ``Scream 3'' killed at the box office, taking in more
than $75 million in its first few weeks, all involved are still
insisting that this was the final go-round for the still-potent
franchise.
 &HT;    Speaking of endings, the actress has also decided to depart
``Party of Five'' at the end of this season, whether or not Fox
decides to renew the long-running series, whose ratings have
slipped in recent months.
 &HT;    ``It's bittersweet,'' she says quietly. ``I've spent 15 hours a
day, five days a week, for six years with these people on `Party of
Five.' I've spent more time being Julia than being myself in a lot
of ways, which is frightening.
 &HT;    ``So I am sad to see it go,'' she admits. ``It is the reason I
came to the States. It's why my face got out there. It's been great
for me _ it's been a great way for me to work my muscles every day
as an actor, which not many people get to do.''
 &HT;    She feels much the same way about the ``Scream'' series _ happy
to have done it, even if she's also happy to be able to move on.
 &HT;    ``I've had a blast,'' Campbell says. ``We just have so much fun
together on those films. So I am sad to say goodbye to them, but
I'm also really excited about new opportunities and growing and
staying inspired.''
 &HT;    And getting some rest, adds the actress, who politely declines
comment on her relationship with actor John Cusack, but waxes
enthusiastic about a recent vacation in Hawaii and her current
mission to learn Spanish.
 &HT;    ``I will definitely slow down,'' Campbell says. ``My schedule
can't ever be as hard as it has been for the last six years,
because I won't be doing nine months of a television show and then
at least two movies at hiatus.''
 &HT;    Well, maybe and maybe not. After all, Campbell has already
completed ``Panic,'' co-starring William H. Macy. And, only 10 days
after wrapping production on ``Party of Five,'' she'll jet off to
Berlin to star with Nick Nolte in Alan Rudolph's drama
``Investigating Sex.''
 &HT;    ``What I'd like is just to do films and to be able to choose my
scripts and take time off,'' Campbell says, smiling. ``I think it
will be easier to spend time with myself.
 &HT;    ``So I'm scared and I'm excited about the opportunities,'' she
concludes. ``I hope it will work out.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   In Hollywood, where image is everything, the latest formula for
actresses seems to be: Skinny  &QC;  Stardom.
</P>
<P>
   Stick-figure celebrities are all over the big and small screens,
and we've watched their weights drop until their bones show
through. The roster includes Jennifer Aniston and Courteney Cox
Arquette on ``Friends'' and ``Ally McBeal's'' Calista Flockhart.
Debra Messing of ``Will &AMP; Grace,'' Paula Devicq of ``Party of
Five'' and Lara Flynn Boyle of ``The Practice'' are often
punchlines in late-night monologues. ``Frasier's'' English beauty,
Jane Leeves, has noticeably lost inches, as have Helen Hunt and
Gwyneth Paltrow.
</P>
<P>
   Incredibly, size-four comedian Kathy Griffin of ``Suddenly
Susan'' felt she had to undergo a liposuction operation that ended
in an allergic reaction to an anesthetic and a bladder infection.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I lost,'' Griffin told Glamour magazine, ``was about
$6,000.''
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, there's more to this trend than skewed aesthetics
or celebrity follies. These superthin actresses are role models to
their fans, especially teen-age and pre-teen girls, whose yearning
to emulate their idols can result in serious, even life-threatening
eating disorders.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's always been a beauty ideal that people have strived
toward,'' says Barb Callaghan, assistant program director at the
National Eating Disorder Information Centre in Toronto. ``We do set
a certain value on being thin and what thinness means. If you look
at the media, they perpetuate that. Thinness is success. Thinness
is beautiful.''
</P>
<P>
   Fashion magazines are the worst offenders, Callaghan adds, but
films and television aren't far behind.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the Hollywood industry you have to look a certain way to
get the parts,'' she says. ``It's a standard that's been set.''
</P>
<P>
   The pressure is toughest on actresses struggling to land that
first big break.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard when you find out you didn't get a job because you
weren't pretty or thin enough,'' says Sarah Paulson of ``Jack &AMP;
Jill.'' ``I want them to put me in that movie _ do I conform to
what their form of beauty is, or do I stick to my own guns?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really hard _ you fluctuate back and forth.''
</P>
<P>
   Needless to say, male actors don't face nearly the same
challenge. They may feel pressured to ``look the part,'' but it's
not a career-killer for a man to be overweight _ he can even earn
slightly tongue-in-cheek status as a sex symbol.
</P>
<P>
   When ``NYPD Blue's'' 235-pound Dennis Franz bared his behind in
a 1994 episode, the media hype was deafening. But how many
235-pound female's butts will television viewers ever see?
</P>
<P>
   On doctor's advice, Franz shed about 35 pounds last year, yet he
says his low-carbohydrate diet nonetheless allows him to eat ``vats
of Jell-O and whipped cream.'' It's a rare quote to read in a diet
story, and unimaginable in one about a female star.
</P>
<P>
   One of the rare venues where talent triumphs over dress size is
the ratings-challenged sitcom ``Veronica's Closet.'' Its two leads,
Kirstie Alley and Kathy Najimy, are women who unashamedly have real
meat on their bones.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the show's funniest scenes have belonged to Najimy, who
often speaks out against the only-thin-is-beautiful ideal. Earlier
this year she put her body where her belief was, modeling
plus-sized lingerie for a New York fashion show.
</P>
<P>
   The standard bearer for a more inclusive definition of beauty
is, of course, ``The Practice's'' Camryn Manheim. Her ``fat girls''
acceptance speech at the 1998 Emmy Awards quickly become the stuff
of Hollywood legend, and her autobiography, ``Wake Up, I'm Fat''
(Broadway Books, 1999), is a virtual manifesto for her cause.
</P>
<P>
   Still, she feels that even now her size hampers her career
opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as a leading movie role and making it romantic,'' she
says, ``I don't see that around the bend anytime soon.''
</P>
<P>
   Guys have it easier, especially on the small screen. One key
story line on ``The Drew Carey Show'' is the sexual tension between
beer-bellied Carey and his svelte girlfriend Kate (Christa Miller).
The characters reportedly will consummate their relationship in a
much-hyped episode later this season.
</P>
<P>
   Manheim notes, however, that while a woman who by female
standards was as large as Carey would rarely be viewed as
attractive, even he is subject to an arbitrary standard of beauty.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he had fatty breasts, that would not be right,'' Manheim
says. ``Men with beer guts aren't considered fat, but men with
breasts are considered fat _ it's like a masculine and feminine
thing.''
</P>
<P>
   As far as a lot of actors are concerned, the media is as
responsible for the cult of thinness as any producer or casting
director.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole thing has gotten out of hand this past year,'' says
Michael Badaluco, the tall, stocky co-star of ``The Practice.''
``All you read about in magazines or tabloids is whether this
actress is anorexic. I guess it sells magazines.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of it should really be people's private business.''
</P>
<P>
   Sensational stories about too-skinny stars do sell, however, and
there's not much that the actresses themselves can do about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have control over what people write,'' Cox Arquette
says. ``If they say we're too thin, I can't take responsibility for
that. I happen to like the way I am _ or maybe I don't, but that's
nobody else's business.''
</P>
<P>
   Aniston, who has experienced a full-court media press because of
her relationship with Brad Pitt, says that all a performer can do
is to try to ignore the tabloid stories.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once you realize that these are people doing a job and they
have to put entertainment in magazines, you can take things less
personally, the good and the bad,'' she says. ``You realize it's
only one guy in a room writing something to make you feel bad. One
guy.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has the ability and he knows that _ that's his little
thrill for the day.''
</P>
<P>
   It's harder to ignore direct questions during interviews.
</P>
<P>
   ``Am I anorexic? Am I bulimic? I get that question all the
time,'' says Jaime Pressley of ``Jack &AMP; Jill.''
</P>
<P>
   Pressley started her career as a dancer and gymnast, but says
she couldn't find work as an actress until she lost the thick
muscle in her legs and torso.
</P>
<P>
   ``The day I did press interviews,'' she recalls, ``I had 80
people in a row ask me if I was anorexic, why I was so thin. Why am
I losing all this weight? Do I think I need to? Am I eating? What
do I eat?''
</P>
<P>
   She motions to her baggy sweater and loose-fitting khakis.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why I dress this way _ I'm so tired of it,'' she says.
``I couldn't be more sick of people looking at my body and telling
me I'm too thin.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not about who's got a beautiful ass or a scrawny ass.
It's because I can act.''
</P>

   &UR; The earth's habit of forever remaking itself in paroxysms of
fire and violence is sometimes hard on its inhabitants, a lesson
borne out again last week when villagers in Legaspi, Philippines,
fled eruptions of the deadly volcano Mayon. In a new book,
``Vulcan's Fury: Man Against the Volcano'' (Yale University Press),
Alwyn Scarth uses witnesses' accounts to tell of 15 great eruptions
and of the people who lived through them. Here is a sampling. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Vesuvius, A.D. 79
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Vesuvius, looming 4,200 feet over the Bay of Naples, has
erupted at least 200 times in the last two millenniums, most
famously and lethally in A.D. 79 when it smothered Pompeii and
other villages in ash. Among the casualties was the Roman scholar
Pliny the Elder, whose nephew, Pliny the Younger, provided an
eyewitness account of the catastrophe: &LR;
</P>
<P>
   On 24 August, about one in the afternoon, my mother pointed out
a cloud with an odd size and appearance that had just formed ....
From that distance, it was not even clear from which mountain the
cloud was rising _ although it was found afterward to be Vesuvius.
The cloud could best be described as more of an umbrella pine than
any other tree, because it rose high up in a kind of trunk and then
divided into branches .... Sometimes it looked light-colored,
sometimes it looked mottled and dirty with the earth and ash it had
carried up. Like a true scholar, my uncle saw at once that it
deserved closer study ...
</P>
<P>
   &UR; The next day: &LR;  The carriages we had ordered began to lurch to
and fro, although the ground was flat, and we could not keep them
still, even when we wedged their wheels with stones. Then we saw
the sea sucked back, apparently by an earthquake, and many
creatures were left stranded on the sand ....
</P>
<P>
   From the other direction, over the land, a dreadful black cloud
was torn by gushing, twisting, flames and great tongues of fire
like much-magnified lightning .... The cloud sank down soon
afterward and covered the sea, hiding Capri and Cape Misenum from
sight. ... Ash was already falling by now, but not very thickly.
Then I turned round and saw the thick black cloud advancing over
the land behind us like a flood. ``Let us leave the road whilst we
can still see,'' I said, ``or we will be knocked down and trampled
by the crowd.'' But it was not the darkness of a moonless, or
cloudy night, but just as if all the lamps had been put out in a
completely closed room ....
</P>
<P>
   We could hear women shrieking, children crying, and men
shouting. Some were calling for their parents, for their children,
or for their wives, and trying to recognize them by their voices
.... Some people prayed for death because they were so frightened
of dying. Many begged for the help of the gods, but even more
imagined that there were no gods left and that the last eternal
night had fallen on the world.
</P>
<P>
   Laki, 1783
</P>
<P>
   &UR; On June 8, 1873, fissures split open on the flanks of a
mountain ridge known as Laki near the southern coast of Iceland.
Over the next eight months, more than three cubic miles of lava
poured from the fissures and a sulfurous blue haze spread over the
countryside. A farmer, Jon Steingrimmson, wrote this report. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   The hairy sand-fall and sulfurous rain caused such
unwholesomeness in the air and in the earth that the grass became
yellow and pink and withered down to the roots. The animals that
wandered around the fields got yellow-colored feet with open
wounds, and yellow dots were seen on the skin of the newly shorn
sheep, which had died.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; By the end of July, according to The Leeds Intelligencer in
England, the haze had spread over Europe: &LR;
</P>
<P>
   The foreign papers mention that the haziness, which has lately
prevailed here, is general throughout all the southern part of
Europe. It is even observed upon the most lofty of Alps. In Italy,
it has occasioned great consternation, as the same appearance of
the air was remarked in Calabria and Sicily a little previous to
those dreadful earthquakes that had destroyed so many cities. The
people of France, too, began to forebode some dire calamity. The
Paris Gazette mentions that the churches are most unusually
crowded, and the shrines of their saints uncommonly frequented.
</P>
<P>
   Krakatau, 1883
</P>
<P>
   &UR; The Aug. 26, 1883, the explosion of Krakatau, in the Soenda
Straits between Sumatra and Java, was heard as far away as
Australia. It disgorged some five cubic miles of ash and dust. Most
of the Krakatau's 36,000 victims died by drowning in tsunamis. This
rice farmer, five miles inland on Java, barely survived. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   All of a sudden there came a great noise. We ... saw a great
black thing, a long way off, coming toward us. It was very high and
very strong, and we soon saw that it was water. Trees and houses
were washed away .... Not far off was some steep sloping ground. We
all ran toward it and tried to climb up out of the way of the
water. ((The wave)) was too quick for most of them, and many were
drowned almost at my side .... There was a general rush to climb up
in one particular place. This caused a great block, and many of
them got wedged together and could not move. Then they struggled
and fought, screaming and crying out all the time. Those below
tried to make those above them move on again by biting their heels.
... Some ... dragged others down with them. They would not let go
their hold, nor could those above them release themselves from this
death grip.
</P>
<P>
   Montagne Pelee, 1902
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Montagne Pelee, or ``Fire Mountain,'' on the Caribbean island
of Martinique, &LR;   &UR; had been thought to be harmless until a series of
earthquakes and explosions in the spring of 1902 transformed its
4,000-foot summit into a hellish landscape of fissures, cinder
cones and a lake of boiling water. On May 5, an earthquake breached
the lip of the new lake, releasing a wall of mud down the Blanche
River valley. Near the mouth of the river, Auguste Guerin was about
to board his yacht with his family when he turned back toward his
house for a moment: &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Then I heard a noise I can't compare with anything else _ an
immense noise _ like the devil on earth! A black avalanche, beneath
white smoke, an enormous mass, full of huge blocks, more than 10
meters high and at least 150 meters wide, was coming down the
mountain with a great din. It ... rolled up against the factory
like an army of giant rams. I was rooted on the spot.
</P>
<P>
   My unfortunate son and wife ran away from it toward the shore
.... All at once, the mud arrived. It passed 10 meters in front of
me. I felt its deathly breath. There was a great crashing sound.
Everything was crushed, drowned and submerged. My son, his wife,
and 30 ... people and huge buildings were all swept away .... Three
of those black waves came down ... making a noise like thunder, and
made the sea retreat. Under the impact of the third wave, a boat
moored in the factory harbor was thrown ... over a factory wall,
killing one of my foremen, who was standing next to me. I went down
to the shore. The desolation was indescribable. Where a prosperous
factory _ the work of a lifetime _ had stood a moment before, there
was now nothing left but an expanse of mud forming a black shroud
for my son, his wife and my workmen.

</P>
<P>
   &UR; Three days later, the volcano exploded. Within two minutes,
some 27,000 people in the town of St. Pierre were dead. One
survivor, Louis-Auguste Sylbaris, was in solitary confinement in
jail. He later had a career with the Barnum &AMP; Bailey circus as the
only survivor of the ``Silent City of Death.'' &LR;
</P>
<P>
   They hadn't yet brought my daily rations, when, all of a sudden,
there was a terrifying noise. Everybody was screaming ``Help! Help!
I'm burning! I'm dying!'' Five minutes later, nobody was crying out
anymore _ except me. Then a cloud of smoke gushed through the
opening .... It burnt me so much that I was dancing up and down,
left and right _ everywhere _ to get out of its way .... I listened
and shouted for help, but nobody answered.
</P>
<P>
   Paricutin, 1943
</P>
<P>
   &UR; In early 1943 scientists got a rare chance to observe the birth
of a volcano in Mexico, when earthquakes began rumbling the town of
Paricutin, about 200 miles west of Mexico City, with such
increasing frequency that local inhabitants were afraid to sleep.
On Feb. 20 a farmer, Dionisio Pulido, noticed a new hole in his
cornfield. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   I noticed that a little hole ... on one of the knolls on my land
had opened, and I noticed that this fissure, as I followed it up
with my eye, was long and passed from where I stood, through the
hole, and stretched back ((westward)) to Cerro de Canicjuata ....
`Here is something strange,' I thought ... and I searched the
ground for marks to see if it had opened during the night or not,
but I couldn't find any.
</P>
<P>
   I heard some thunder, the trees trembled, and ... then I saw how
the ground swelled up 2 meters or 2.5 meters in the hole, and a
kind of smoke, or fire dust _ gray like ashes _ began to rise from
a part of the crack I had not seen before. Immediately, more smoke
began to rise up with a loud and continuous hiss or whistle, and
there was a smell of sulfur .... Then the ground rose in the form
of a confused cake above the open fissure, and then disappeared,
but I cannot say whether it blew out or fell back _ I believe it
swallowed itself. I was sure the earth was on fire ....
</P>
<P>
   I was very frightened, and I mounted my mare and galloped to
Paricutin, where I found my wife and son and friends waiting for
me. They were afraid that I was dead and that they would never see
me again.
</P>
<P>
   Mount St. Helens, 1980
</P>
<P>
   &UR; The whole world was watching on the morning of Sunday, May 18,
1980, when Mount St. Helens, an 8,000-foot-high snow-capped cone in
the southern part of Washington state, blew its top after two
months of preliminary rumblings and eruptions, leaving a hole two
miles long, a mile across and 2,000 feet deep, and 57 people dead.
Among those watching on a nearby ridge was a geologist, David
Johnston, who just had time to radio his base ``Vancouver!
Vancouver! This is it!'' before the wall of burning gas and rock
hit and killed him. Circling above the mountain in a chartered
plane were the geologists Keith and Dorothy Stoffel. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   The nature of the movement was eerie .... The entire mass began
to ripple and churn up .... Then the entire north side of the
summit began sliding north ... we were watching this landslide of
unbelievable proportions slide down ... the mountain toward Spirit
Lake .... Before we could snap off more than a few pictures, a huge
explosion blasted out .... We neither felt nor heard a thing even
though we were ((flying)) just east of the summit at the time ...
the initial realization of the enormous size of the eruption hit
us, and we focused our attention on getting out of there.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Researchers estimate that rice and corn began evolving their
separate ways from a common grassy ancestor at least 60 million
years ago. But how far did they travel?
</P>
<P>
   Intriguingly, researchers have found that the genes in corn that
tell the plant what proteins to make to produce its shape, its cob,
its roots and its reproductive system _ in short, everything that
makes it corn _ have largely identical counterparts in rice,
arrayed in pretty much the same order.
</P>
<P>
   That suggests that the differences between the plants might come
in large part not from the genes themselves, but from the point at
which they are switched on and off, how strongly and in which part
of the plant they are active. And now some wonder if this insight
can be used for a new kind of genetic engineering.
</P>
<P>
   No one is more enthusiastic about such inquiries than Dr.
Richard A. Jefferson, 43, the founder of the Center for the
Application of Molecular Biology to International Agriculture in
Canberra, Australia, who sometimes declares, ``Rice is corn.''
</P>
<P>
   Although he knows that is an exaggeration, it serves as a catchy
introduction to how his institute is trying to reshape the tangled
global debate over the role of genetic engineering in agricultural
biotechnology.
</P>
<P>
   Jefferson argues that the high degree of genetic overlap between
the plants _ indeed, among all living things _ suggests that much
of the gene swapping among species that has stirred up so much
opposition to genetic engineering may be unnecessary. Perhaps,
instead of moving a valuable trait like resistance to cold from a
fish to a plant, genetic engineers could achieve the same result by
goading the plant into a mutation that activates genes for cold
tolerance already present in its DNA.
</P>
<P>
   Jefferson, a native of Berkeley, Calif., is not opposed to
moving genes among different forms of life. In fact, he first made
his mark in biotechnology at the University of Colorado in 1985 by
inventing a way to track the location and activity of genes as
researchers moved them from one species to another.
</P>
<P>
   In 1987, in one of the first field tests of a genetically
altered food crop, he raised genetically altered potatoes at the
Plant Breeding Institute in Cambridge, England.
</P>
<P>
   Today, though, Jefferson's nonprofit research center, known as
Cambia, is pouring resources into a project to jumble and rejumble
the on-off patterns of rice genes, hoping to unleash traits buried
in rice that evolution might not get around to exhibiting for
millions of years, if ever.
</P>
<P>
   Promising mutants _ say rice that produces vitamin A in the
grain _ could be developed into viable crops in developing
countries within four or five years by crossing them with existing
crops, according to Dr. Andrzej Kilian, who was hired to run the
research. And Cambia is working with partners to apply the same
concepts to cassava, cowpea and other plants vital to food supplies
in developing countries.
</P>
<P>
   ``Evolution uses random forces all the time,'' Kilian said. ``We
are trying to speed it up and make it manageable.''
</P>
<P>
   Laboratory-driven mutation work is just one of many Cambia
projects aimed at the needs of farmers in developing countries.
Jefferson hopes such efforts will create a way for small businesses
and developing countries to exploit biotechnology while skirting
the fortress of patents that Monsanto, DuPont and other
multinational giants have assembled. And that, in turn, could
please some current critics of biotechnology.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a noble effort,'' said Hope Shand, research director of
the Rural Advancement Foundation International U.S.A., a group
based in Pittsford, N.C., which has been a high-profile opponent of
the biotechnology industry. ``Our main concern has always been who
benefits and who controls the technology.''
</P>
<P>
   Cambia's technology still crosses species lines in ways that
could upset some critics of biotechnology. Cambia's process, which
it calls transgenomics, does not move genes intended to introduce a
novel trait into rice, but its method for changing rice's
regulation of its own genes does require on-off switches to be
imported from bacteria, yeast or other plants.
</P>
<P>
   ``People may look at this differently than some of the
transspecies work but some of the risks they worry about would
still be there,'' said Dr. Margaret Mellon, who tracks
biotechnology issues at the Union of Concerned Scientists in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Mellon said that Cambia's work might provide valuable research
on plant genetics, but that those concerned with world hunger ought
to see it as a poor alternative to breeding programs crossing rice
with wild relatives, like that being run in China by Chinese
researchers and Dr. Susan McCouch, a Cornell scientist.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   McCouch has reported increasing yields on commercial rice
strains by 10 percent to 20 percent by crossing them with wild
species. In one case, the offspring surprisingly proved to be
resistant to a virus plaguing Latin American rice growers, even
though neither parent was.
</P>
<P>
   Such work is often cited by opponents of biotechnology as proof
that genetic engineering is unnecessary and distracting, but
McCouch herself doubts that traditional breeding alone will meet
the developing world's food needs. McCouch and others say the
transgenomics program is a logical, if bold, use of the growing
mountain of research on how mutations occur naturally.
</P>
<P>
   It has been known for decades that organisms occasionally cut
loose pieces of their own regulatory DNA so that they can jump,
apparently randomly, to other locations and possibly activate genes
with helpful traits. Production of the enzymes, or transposases,
that free the mobile DNA, or transposons, increases when organisms
are under almost any kind of stress.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the genome's last ditch responses under stress is to
reshuffle the deck,'' McCouch said.
</P>
<P>
   Cambia is trying to mimic the natural process by inserting a
packet of DNA from yeast, bacteria and corn DNA that can only be
activated when a rice gene is nearby and active. When the rice gene
is switched on, it simultaneously turns on a cascade of activity in
the inserted DNA packet: one result is that a ``reporter'' gene _
Cambia's comes from bacteria _ begins producing a protein that has
no effect on the plant but can be used by researchers to figure out
where the packet has landed in the rice genome and how powerfully
the nearby rice gene is working.
</P>
<P>
   The activity also turns on DNA fragments that Cambia takes from
yeast that amplify gene activity. That can boost the activity of
the adjacent rice gene, which may produce noticeable changes in the
plant. But Cambia's real mutation thrust is based on including in
the DNA packet a DNA package that can become mobile when the plant
is crossed with another plant containing an enzyme that frees it.
</P>
<P>
   If the mobile segment jumps from, for example, a location next
to a rice gene active during seed development to the neighborhood
of a gene involved in root growth, it will be turned on and
stimulate the root gene when the seed gene becomes active.
</P>
<P>
   That process mimics what a rice transposon might do naturally if
the plant were under stress. Researchers must still screen
thousands of plants, just as natural breeders do, looking for
mutations that are beneficial to farmers.
</P>
<P>
   Cambia is now building a library of plants with the DNA packages
inserted near various rice genes. It has about 3,000 rice plants
and expects to reach a goal of 10,000 by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Theoretically, there is plenty of room to create new functions
for existing genes. ``Plant genes are generally redundant,'' said
Dr. Susan Wessler, an expert in corn and rice genetics at the
University of Georgia. ``There may be eight copies of a gene.''
Thus, one copy of the gene could be reregulated to produce a new
trait by a transposon without necessarily compromising the plant.
</P>
<P>
   Multinational companies have been notably silent about whether
they are doing similar research. Jefferson said some were
negotiating nonexclusive licensing agreements for transgenomics
technology, parts of which could be used to make existing genetic
engineering more precise.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, corn might be engineered so that its bacterially
derived pesticide gene is turned on only in the parts of the plant
that corn borers eat. Now, engineered corn expresses the pesticide
all over the plant, including in pollen that can be deadly to
monarch butterflies and other beneficial insects.
</P>
<P>
   But plenty of admirers working in research are hoping
Jefferson's aim of using transgenomics to perform an end run around
the multinationals' current approach to biotechnology pays off.
</P>
<P>
   ``Richard's focus is on those people for whom agriculture is
most vital,'' said Dr. Jeffrey Bennetzen, a Purdue University plant
genetics researcher. ``Our biggest problem is overproduction, but
the developing world really needs crop improvement.''

 &HT;    GOP GOVERNORS: LET'S RUN A BUSH-McCAIN TICKET
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (p) politics categories.
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Republican governors would clearly like to see one
of their own, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, in the White House. But
as they met here Monday, there were signs that they would be almost
as happy if Sen. John McCain won out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think President McCain would be an excellent president,
compared to a Vice President (Al) Gore or a Senator (Bill)
Bradley,'' Gov. Bill Owens of Colorado told reporters. ``My choice,
in order, is George Bush and then John McCain.''
</P>
<P>
   His sentiments were promptly echoed by two fellow Republicans
from two other probable battleground states in the November
election: Paul Cellucci of Massachusetts and Tom Ridge of
Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   Even more intriguing to the political trio, who came to a press
lunch during the annual winter National Governors' Association
winter meeting, was the idea of a Bush picking McCain as his
running mate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a blockbuster ticket,'' said Ridge, who himself
is thought to be on the Bush vice-presidential radar scope should
Bush prevail.
</P>
<P>
   Owens went further in suggesting that Bush should agree to run
in the second spot with McCain if the Arizona senator wins the GOP
nomination.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be a rational unifying gesture by either of those
candidates to go to the second-running candidate and make that
offer,'' Owens said.
</P>
<P>
   He cited as a model ``the 1980 experience'' at the Republican
National Convention in Detroit, when former California Gov. Ronald
Reagan went to George Bush, his former top challenger, to offer him
the vice-presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was the Reagan chairman in my county in Colorado, and I know
how that helped bring the party together for the general
election,'' Owens said.
</P>
<P>
   The governors largely discounted the increasingly harsh tone of
the current campaign as possibly standing in the way of an eventual
reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
   Said Ridge: ``I know there's tremendous mutual respect between
the two of them. That's true despite what their surrogates are
saying and the accusations that are now flying back and forth.''
</P>
<P>
   After last week's Michigan primary, which McCain won, Gov. John
Engler, a Republican, said he ``thought McCain was a very likely
person to be on the ticket.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush has yet to indicate a choice of a running mate should his
quest for the nomination prove successful. But McCain, who has
served 18 years in the Senate and chairs one of its most powerful
committees, has made it clear on numerous occasions that he's not
interested in the vice-presidential post, should it be offered to
him.
</P>
<P>
   When asked on NBC-TV's ``Meet the Press'' last December, ``Would
you accept the vice presidency from George Bush?'' McCain
responded, ``Under no circumstances.''

ISRAELI SINGER SAID TO HAVE DIED OF AIDS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By DEBORAH SONTAG   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ An Israeli newspaper reported Monday that an
internationally known Israeli singer whose funeral last week drew
both the elite and the working class, had died of complications
from AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   The report, in the daily Haaretz, set off a stormy debate about
whether the paper had crudely violated the privacy of the singer,
Ofra Haza, and journalistic ethics, or whether it had done a public
service by refusing to treat AIDS as an illness whose name cannot
be spoken.
</P>
<P>
   Haza, a Jew whose family came from Yemen, rose from poverty to
stardom in a way that inspired many Sephardic immigrants to Israel
She did not want public exposure of her illness and went so far as
to keep it secret from the Tel Aviv hospital workers who first
treated her in an emergency room two weeks ago, Haaretz said.
</P>
<P>
   In an editorial on Monday, the newspaper said it had felt
compelled by widespread whispering about the cause of death,
including broad hints on the evening news programs, to lift ``the
fragile tissue of silence, stretched tenuously over a fervor of
rumors.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There is hardly a house in Israel in which the word `AIDS' did
not get spoken in recent days,'' said Yoel Esteron, the managing
editor of Haaretz. ``And in these circumstances to continue not to
publish is to publish something that is not true.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ofra Haza was a public figure and to a certain extent public
property in her life. In her death it is impossible to leave this
chapter in darkness. We are talking about a human disease like any
other, and there is no reason to demonize it.''
</P>
<P>
   When Haza died on Wednesday at the age of 41, after 13 days in
the hospital during which her fans maintained a round-the-clock
vigil, the news media reported the cause as organ failure. But many
reporters knew the specific cause of death, and unusually for this
small country where the collective spirit often collides with
respect for privacy, they did not disclose it.
</P>
<P>
   That was the way it should have been, a Health Ministry
spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a consensus to keep silent, even after her death,''
said Yoram Malca, the spokesman. ``I think today Haaretz broke all
the norms and ethical and moral standards that we still have in
this country. I think that it's a person's right to guard his
privacy. What do we have left in life, or after our deaths, if not
that little bit of knowledge that we can live and die with
dignity?''
</P>
<P>
   A mezzo-soprano who developed an international reputation, Haza
sang traditional and pop music and emphasized her roots by
performing in elaborately brocaded traditional clothing. She had
club hits in Europe, Asia and the United States and sang the part
of Moses' mother in the movie ``Prince of Egypt.''
</P>
<P>
   But she was equally well known here _ where Jews with roots in
Yemen have had a hard time breaking out of the underclass _ for the
inspirational narrative of her life. Prime Minister Ehud Barak
mentioned that in the statement he issued on her death. ``Ofra
emerged from the Hatikva slums to reach the peak of Israeli
culture,'' he said last week.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Many who called radio talk shows on Monday seemed saddened that
the inspirational story had ended in such an early death and that
the epilogue was a sad one.
</P>
<P>
   But some doctors who treat people with AIDS were horrified at
the message sent by the star in hiding her illness. They raised the
possibility that she had denied herself proper treatment for fear
of being exposed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It brings us back to the beginning of the epidemic with the
near-demonization and stigmatization of a disease that actually we
are dealing with much better,'' said Dr. Zvi Bentwich, head of the
AIDS Center at Kaplan Hospital in Rehovot. ``And in this
unfortunate case, without having all the details, it appears that
Ofra Haza almost died of the embarrassment, from the terrible fear
to reveal her illness.''

&HT;     CALIFORNIA A GOLD MINE FOR BRADLEY CAMPAIGN 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By LANCE WILLIAMS  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Opinion polls give Bill Bradley little chance of
winning California's Democratic primary contest on March 7. But
there is one key constituency that favors former New Jersey senator
over Vice President Al Gore: checkbook Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   According to Federal Election Commission records, Bradley raised
more political money in California in 1999 than the vice president,
$4.2 million to $3.8 million.
</P>
<P>
   The records show that Bradley outperformed Gore in part because
of hefty donations from computer executives in the Silicon Valley.
According to the records, Bradley got more money than Gore from
most other California interest groups as well: financial
institutions, managed care companies, agricultural interests and
the real estate industry.
</P>
<P>
   Only in Hollywood and among lawyers _ two California
constituencies cultivated by President Clinton _ did the vice
president raise more money than Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   In a state where Democrats are dominant, Bradley and Gore
together managed to raise only about $1 million more than Texas
Gov. George W. Bush, the Republican presidential hopeful, has
raised alone.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, who has visited California more than 50 times since he
became vice president in 1993, began 1999 with a big fund-raising
advantage here over Bradley, records show, but they also show that
donor enthusiasm for the vice president began to cool last summer.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Bradley's fund-raising surged. One mega-event, a
Sept. 30 fund-raiser in the Silicon Valley that reaped $635,000,
put the challenger ahead of Gore.
</P>
<P>
   According to the records, executives at the state's financial
institutions were another big source of campaign cash for Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   Bankers and brokers gave him $744,000 _ $300,000 more than Gore
_ but only half that they donated to Bush.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest bundle of all came from the Palo Alto high-tech law
firm Wilson, Sonsini. Thirty-nine lawyers there, including partner
Larry Sonsini, combined to write $37,000 in checks for Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley raised more money in the San Francisco Bay Area than
either Bush or Gore _ $2.4 million. He also was the top political
fund-raiser in San Francisco, where he raised $685,000.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's biggest fund-raising success came in the state's
communications industry, where be received $619,745, more than
either Bradley or Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Gore did especially well in Hollywood, where Clinton was a
hugely effective fund-raiser.
</P>
<P>
   Executives at Warner Brothers gave him $36,000, those at
Paramount Pictures gave $33,750 and those at Dreamworks SKG, the
movie studio headed by David Geffen, Steven Spielberg and Jeffrey
Katzenberg, contributed $15,000.
</P>
<P>
   Among celebrities donating $1,000 to Gore: television producer
Norman Lear; Simpsons creator Matt Groening; filmmaker Oliver
Stone; and actors Candice Bergen, Kevin Costner, Ted Danson,
Michael Douglas, Tom Hanks, Suzanne Somers, Mary Steenburgen and
Billy Dee Williams.
</P>
<P>
   Jazz pianist Herbie Hancock and singer Sheryl Crow each gave
$1,000, and the Eagles combined to give $3,000.
</P>
<P>
   Gore also did well among the state's lawyers, getting $570,000,
$27,000 more than Bradley and $112,000 more than Bush. Partners
from Los Angeles' O'Melveny &AMP; Myers ($17,550) and San Francisco's
Morrison &AMP; Foerster ($14,250) gave the most.
</P>
<P>
   But among most other interest groups, Gore trailed both Bradley
and Bush. The state's financial industry gave him slightly more
than half what Bradley obtained and $1 for every $3 that Bush
received.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Dianne Feinstein was the top elected official to donate to
Gore ($1,000). Other prominent Democrats, including Gov. Gray Davis
and Sen. Barbara Boxer, did not donate to either candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Gore got two-thirds of his money from Southern California, and
most of the rest from the San Francisco area.
</P>
<P>
   Although Bradley dominated most interest groups, he raised
surprisingly little money from one industry segment he knows the
best: pro basketball.
</P>
<P>
   The former New York Knicks star got $4,800 from state basketball
executives, including $500 from the Los Angeles Lakers' Jerry West
and $300 from the Golden State Warriors' Al Attles.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley did much better with executives from another sport:
big-league baseball. He received $8,000: $2,250 from the San
Francisco Giants, $1,000 from the Los Angeles Dodgers and $4,750
from the San Diego Padres.

SMASHING PUMPKINS, STEELY DAN ISSUE EAGERLY AWAITED CDS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVE FERMAN 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   On paper, Steely Dan and the Smashing Pumpkins have nothing in
common _ not their music, not their age, not their audience, not
their visibility during the past 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   The Pumpkins hail from Chicago and in the past eight years have
become one of the biggest alternative-rock (if such a thing still
exists) bands on the planet, arguably ``the'' biggest, selling
millions of CDs and embarking on lengthy arena-filling tours as
songs such as ``Cherub Rock, 1979'' and ``Bullet With Butterfly
Wings'' have become as well-known to rock fans under 30 as
``Stairway to Heaven'' was in the '70s.
</P>
<P>
   The Dan is the partnership of Donald Fagen and Walter Becker,
who in 1972 began releasing a string of slick jazz-meets-rock CDs
that became enormously popular between 1972 and 1980 on the basis
of a string of impeccably produced, lyrically odd and musically
adventurous LPs.
</P>
<P>
   What links them, then? They both have eagerly awaited CDs out
Tuesday. So there.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   At least half the fun of being a Steely Dan fan in the '70s was
not knowing what it would do next _ and the other half was knowing
exactly what it would do next.
</P>
<P>
   In a decade obsessed with musical prowess _ which often
translated as bloated, self-indulgent art- and jazz-rock _ Donald
Fagen and Walter Becker made truly admirable music. Their forte was
combining jazz sensibilities with a pop aesthetic that featured odd
and sometimes obscure lyrics about fringe characters and agreeable
singalong choruses.
</P>
<P>
   And their output _ seven LPs and at least as many era-defining
songs in a mere eight years _ was astonishingly high, even if they
didn't tour and apparently lived in expensive recording studios in
Los Angeles and New York.
</P>
<P>
   Admirable guys, these two: highbrow but funky, oddly compelling
but archly distant, capable of playing kick-butt rock 'n' roll but
astutely cerebral. At its best, Steely Dan was all things to all
people _ writers of catchy radio fodder that had a nasty, knowing
underbelly.
</P>
<P>
   And then they went away. For more than a decade.
</P>
<P>
   And then they came back _ sort of _ to do a few shed tours that
only left their legions of fans wanting more. Much more.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the expectations surrounding ``Two Against
Nature,'' the Dan's first studio recording since 1980's tepid
``Gaucho,'' are unrealistic: They've had 20 years, right? So this
has got to be a classic record, on a par with or better than
``Countdown to Ecstasy'' or ``Aja.''
</P>
<P>
   Sorry, no. Although superbly crafted and possessed of a number
of worthy mellow pop grooves, ``Two'' too often feels vapid _ not
empty, but hardly ever fully realized.
</P>
<P>
   Or to put it another way, the surprise factor is way down. All
the pieces we know and love are in place: Fagen sings in that weird
little voice about weird people, the band percolates along but
hardly ever really chugs _ much less rocks with the sort of
conviction of a ``My Old School'' _ Becker plays a beautifully
sculpted but uncompelling jazz-rock solo, the chorus is repeated,
over and out.
</P>
<P>
   It's a slickly agreeable sound, to be sure, but the twists and
turns and odd little corners that used to be the most welcome parts
of Dan records are now the exception.
</P>
<P>
   What we're too often left with, on ``Gaslighting Abbie,'' ``Two
Against Nature'' and elsewhere, is far more about pure sanded-down
craft than fresh inspiration. It's a vanilla milkshake rather than
a chocolate one, a CD that only serves to remind us of the almost
endless delights of every one of the band's previous releases save
``Gaucho,'' with which ``Two'' shares a sort of tame, conservative
tunefulness.
</P>
<P>
   And this, too, must be said: Fagen (52) and Becker (50 last
week) seem to have a sort of creepy fascination with vulnerable
young women. ``Janie Runaway'' is the story of a guy who becomes a
sugar daddy to a homeless girl he meets in a New York park and
contains the tease ``Who gets to spend her birthday in Spain?
Possibly you.''
</P>
<P>
   That's icky _ but far ickier is ``Cousin Dupree,'' which
concerns a loser who is sponging off an aunt and who becomes
attracted to his much younger cousin, Jeanine. ``How about a kiss
for your Cousin Dupree?'' is the chorus; one line in a verse is
``What's so strange about a down-home family romance?'' Well, lots
if the girl is still a teen-ager, old sport.
</P>
<P>
   These songs, and ``Negative Girl,'' suggest that the pair have
decided to substitute a perhaps sexist smugness for the
subversiveness that they brought to the best of their stories.

   SMASHING PUMPKINS
</P>
<P>
   Billy Corgan needs an editor.
</P>
<P>
   I say this as a writer, and a Smashing Pumpkins fan, and I would
say it to him if His Baldness ever called me up, which he won't.
</P>
<P>
   Corgan is a man of many talents: As leader of the Smashing
Pumpkins, he spent the band's first three CDs _ ``Gish,'' their
1993 breakthrough ``Siamese Dream'' and '95's monumentally
successful two-CD ``Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness'' _
constructing a metal/alternative/art-rock hybrid and an
angry-little-boy-lost persona.
</P>
<P>
   This made Corgan one of the most famous men in rock 'n' roll,
reviled as a control freak by some, embraced as a voice of a
generation by the twentysomethings who filled arenas around the
world. In Corgan they found a kindred spirit, a guy proud to
display his emotional scars while serrating the ears with some of
the sharper hard rock guitar riffs in recent memory.
</P>
<P>
   But what he does not know is when to shut up. Not that he should
``shut up,'' quit making records forever _ although he hinted
broadly that he was about to do just that in the most recent issue
of ``Rolling Stone.'' But he should, perhaps, learn the art of
judicious pruning: ``MACHINA/the machines of God,'' the Pumpkins'
new CD, is an embrace of life and the search for love. And big,
loud rock 'n' roll.
</P>
<P>
   As such, it's exactly the kind of record the Pumpkins needed to
make: The band's last CD, 1998's ``Adore,'' was a downcast, subdued
affair that found Corgan wrestling with the end of his marriage,
the loss of his mother, Martha, to cancer, and the OD of tour
keyboardist Jonathan Melvoin and subsequent firing of drummer Jimmy
Chamberlin.
</P>
<P>
   ``MACHINA'' is all about better days, moving forward, looking
ahead, falling in love with rock 'n' roll again. Usually hopeful,
the 15 songs here swerve from metal to pop and back again, with
Corgan singing of blue skies and possibilities and so on. ``Away
with everything you've grown to hate,'' he sings on the sailing,
upbeat ``With Every Light.''
</P>
<P>
   The problem is, ``MACHINA'' is overlong, overstuffed, chock-full
of songs that have more noisiness than real intensity. The CD is
more of a retrenchment _ to big, up choruses and thick, brawny
guitar _ but Corgan hardly ever sounds as convincing a hopeful guy
as he did a post-Robert Smith miserabilist searching for
connections even as he was making the amps bleed.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, the band sounds great: Having Chamberlin back in the
fold has helped immeasurably. But all too often all that means is
pro-forma Pumpkins: sturdy pop on ``Stand Inside Your Love,''
hammering hard rock on ``The Everlasting Gaze,'' and not much else.
</P>
<P>
   Well, not much else besides two of the worst songs the band has
ever recorded: ``Heavy Metal Machine'' is just dumb, and the nearly
10-minute ``Glass and the Ghost Children'' is an arty, pretentious
uber-mess.
</P>
<P>
   Leaving these two _ and ``Wound,'' and ``The Crying Tree of
Mercury,'' and ``The Sacred and Profane'' _ on the cutting-room
floor would have made ``MACHINA'' a much stronger record. Then
again, even the songs that remain are not among the strongest the
band has ever done, or even close.
</P>
<P>
   Corgan may be a happier camper these days, but the overall
impact of his work has taken a dip since the heady days of 1993-95.
``MACHINA'' will sell very well, but it doesn't advance the band's
story much.

   EDUCATION-AID _ WASHINGTON _ House Republicans attacked the
Education Department on Monday for ``persistent, serious problems''
with the form used by millions of students to apply for federal
college aid. Since mid-January, the department has admitted that it
incorrectly programmed a formula used to calculate eligibility and
it crafted a new question on drug-related convictions is so complex

which was obtained by Cox Newspapers, lists dozens of weaknesses,
including findings that the IRS can't balance its own checkbook and
misstates the amount of funds put into Social Security and Medicare
trust funds. The GAO also cites careless handling of money,

which will either transfer the records to Colorado or incinerate

<P>
   John McCain condemned Christian conservative leaders Pat
Robertson and Jerry Falwell as ``agents of intolerance'' Monday and
warned his Republican Party against ``pandering to the outer
reaches of American politics.'' In a stinging rebuke delivered in
Virginia, the evangelists' home state, McCain, with Gary Bauer on
stage with him, was careful to say he wasn't attacking religious
conservative voters, only ``a few of their self-appointed
leaders.'' He added: ``Neither party should be defined by pandering
to the outer reaches of American politics and the agents of
intolerance, whether they be Louis Farrakhan or Al Sharpton on the
left, or Pat Robertson and Jerry Falwell on the right.''
</P>
<P>
   SHIELD AGAINST MCCAIN'S `MISSILES'
</P>
<P>
   Reacting to John McCain's assault on ``agents of intolerance,''
George W. Bush said the party needs a presidential candidate who
would unite people instead of playing ``a political game'' of
``pitting one group of people against another.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He's playing the religious card; that's not Reaganesque,''
Bush said. ``That reminds me of the current administration.'' Sen.
John Warner (R-Va.) also was critical of McCain's remarks: ``I have
to tell my old friend to pull back on his throttle and quit trying
to fire heat-seeking missiles up everybody's tailpipe.''
</P>
<P>
   HE COULDN'T GO _ BUT IF HE HAD . . .
</P>
<P>
   While John McCain upbraids George W. Bush, ABC News says it has
learned that McCain also was in discussions with Bob Jones
University about a possible visit. Terry Haskins, speaker pro-tem
of the South Carolina House and McCain's South Carolina
representative confirmed the discussions. ABC reported that talks
lasted only a few days before McCain's national office said the
schedule wouldn't allow for an appearance there. McCain has
repeatedly said he would have given a more courageous speech on
tolerance in contrast to Bush's, if only given the opportunity.
McCain, on the discussions: ``None serious, because there was no
invitation extended.''
</P>
<P>
   `BEAUTY CONTEST' WITHOUT CROWN AND SASH
</P>
<P>
   Bill Bradley, spending six days campaigning in Washington
state's ``beauty contest' primary today, said Monday the state's
voters can send a message across the nation. But they'll have to
remember to send it again in the party caucuses a week later _
because that's when the delegates will be selected.
</P>
<P>
   END COULD BE NEAR FOR BRADLEY
</P>
<P>
   Bill Bradley's insurgent campaign seemed on the verge of
overtaking Al Gore last fall, but since losing in Iowa and New
Hampshire, it seems to have run out of steam. Though Bradley
continues to campaign and is not yet willing to concede defeat,
most Democratic observers say he is unlikely to make it beyond
March 7, the day primaries are held in 16 states. Even those inside
the campaign admit the prospects are dim. Said Rick Wright, who had
helped Bradley raise $27 million: ``Everyone is realistic. We can
all count. We can all see the calendar. We all see the polls.''
</P>
<P>
   TELEPHONE AS CAMPAIGN TOOL
</P>
<P>
   Even as Al Gore was campaigning in Colorado on Monday, he was
keeping an eye on Washington state. He phoned in drive-time
interviews to Seattle radio stations this morning before heading to
rallies in Denver and Pueblo. Gore told interviewers he was
``optimistic'' about today's primary and answered questions about
smoking marijuana in his youth (``I certainly encourage young
people not to get involved in that.'') and labeling of
objectionable music lyrics (``I think parents deserve that.'').
</P>
<P>
   DEBATE A LOW ITEM ON SCHEDULE
</P>
<P>
   With California's March 7 primary approaching, a high-profile
showdown in California seemed threatened when John McCain said he
wouldn't appear at Thursday's scheduled debate in Los Angeles.
McCain said Monday that George W. Bush dallied in committing to the
event, and by the time Bush agreed McCain already was locked into a
campaign schedule he didn't want to change. Bush denied causing
delay and demanded an explanation from McCain.
</P>
<P>
   WEEKEND SWEEP IN TERRITORIES
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush swept presidential contests in four U.S.
territories over the weekend, walking away with 26 delegates to the
national convention. Bush got 93 percent of the vote against John
McCain in Sunday's primary in Puerto Rico to win all 14 delegates
from the island. He also won caucuses held a day earlier in Guam,
American Samoa and the Virgin Islands, getting four national
convention delegates from each. The weekend's 26 delegates pushed
Bush's total to 93; McCain has 96. A candidate needs 1,034
delegates to win the Republican nomination.
</P>
<P>
   OH, THE IRONY OF IT ALL
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush may have reason to be kicking himself now for
favoring a primary in Virginia instead of more-easily controlled
caucuses. Virginia Republicans used to pick delegates by caucuses
and, as noted by the New York Post, Bush would have been a
``shoo-in, with no need to spend much time or cash.'' But the Bush
campaign wanted a primary to help him hold off a more conservative
candidate backed by the religious right. Now, the right is in
Bush's corner.
</P>
<P>
   AHEAD WHERE IT REALLY COUNTS
</P>
<P>
   In California on Monday, a new poll found George W. Bush leading
John McCain by 20 percentage points among the Republican voters who
will choose delegates, but tied with McCain for the popular vote
that includes Democrats and independents. The Field Poll found Bush
leading McCain, 48 percent to 28 percent, among likely Republicans
voters. The poll, conducted Tuesday through Sunday, has a 3
percentage point margin of error.
</P>
<P>
   FIRE, BRIMSTONE AND AN APOCALYPSE
</P>
<P>
   Speaking at the University of Virginia, Alan Keyes ``railed
against what he called the federal government's abuse of power _
running the gamut from his opposition to abortion rights and the
World Trade Organization to his support for the Second Amendment
and teaching creationism in public schools. Keyes also told a
Regents University audience, according to the Richmond
Times-Dispatch, that the nation ``will soon crumble and the world
will face a century of unspeakable horror.''
</P>
<P>
   DOLLAR BILL VS. DR. LAURA
</P>
<P>
   Bill Bradley lashed out at radio talk-show host Laura
Schlessinger, saying her disapproval of homosexuality should
disqualify her from getting a television program. Bradley, in an
interview broadcast over a Web site (www.gaybc.com) that caters to
homosexuals, said Schlessinger's ``total misunderstanding of what
it means to be gay and lesbian'' makes ``me sick to my stomach.''
He also said Paramount should drop its plans to run ``Dr. Laura''
on television this fall.
</P>
<P>
   VENTURA WOULD DO TAG-TEAM WITH MCCAIN
</P>
<P>
   Minnesota Gov. Jesse Ventura, who recently dropped his
affiliation with the Reform Party, told the Minneapolis
Star-Tribune that although he won't endorse anyone for president
until late summer, he'd be glad to listen if John McCain asked him
to be his vice president. Later, Ventura stressed that he'd
consider being McCain's running mate only if McCain loses the
Republican nomination and becomes an independent.
</P>
<P>
   PENNY FOR HIS THOUGHTS
</P>
<P>
   Despite taking early steps toward a campaign, former Rep. Tim
Penny (D-Minn.) said Monday he's decided not to run for the Senate
this year. ``For strictly personal reasons, I have decided to let
this opportunity pass me by,'' Penny, 48, wrote in a statement. He
didn't immediately elaborate. Sen. Rod Grams (R-Minn.) is seeking
re-election to a second term in the Senate.

LEAP OF FAITH: `29ERS' DESCEND ON TINY TEXAS TOWN FOR CELEBRATION 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Eds.: A tilde is needed over second n in quinceanera) 
 
By MARTY RACINE 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANTHONY, Texas _ Don Porto's family thinks he's nuts. And, he
admits with a laugh that borders on a cackle, ``They might have a
point there.''
</P>
<P>
   Porto, a data processing consultant with a wife and two
children, has driven alone from New York to the desert Southwest to
celebrate his 14th birthday.
</P>
<P>
   OK, he was born 56 years ago. But Tuesday is leap day, that
24-hour appendage to February that occurs every four years. And in
this bypass hamlet straddling the Texas-New Mexico line just north
of El Paso, Porto is really 14. And he's sharing the occasion with
scores &UR;  &LR; of other ``29ers'' in the self-styled Leap Year Capital of
the World, where a calendar's asterisk is accorded cult status.
</P>
<P>
   Leap year dates to the Roman Empire, when in 46 B.C. Julius
Caesar decreed that an extra day be added to February every four
years to keep the seasons in sync with the universe. Astronomers
had calculated that Earth's orbit around the sun took 365 days, 5
hours and 48 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   By the 16th century the adjustment put the calendar days out of
kilter, so Pope Gregory XIII subtracted 10 days from 1582 and
ordered the omission of leap years in centuries not evenly
divisible by 400. Thus, 1700, 1800 and 1900 were not leap years,
but 2000 is, making this turn-of-the-century leap year even more
unusual.
</P>
<P>
   But 29ers, or ``leapers,'' find any leap year magical, as if the
sun shines overtime just for them. Even as children they were never
deprived, Porto says.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mother used to feel just heartsick that I had no (annual)
birthday. She would say, `You were born the day after Feb. 28, so
we'll celebrate your birthday March 1.'
</P>
<P>
   ``She'd have a birthday party, and she'd invite the relatives
over. But it didn't take me very long to figure out that I was born
the day before March 1, so the week before I'd really pester her.
She would have a party for just her and me on the 28th.
</P>
<P>
   ``So, I used to have two birthdays every year. And when it came
to be leap year, I'd only get one.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
WHERE IS IT? &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Anthony is literally nowhere, situated at Exit 0 on Interstate
10. Anthony, Texas, is incorporated, with its own city services. As
for the New Mexico side, ``We're a long way from (state capital)
Santa Fe,'' says resident Judy Horton.
</P>
<P>
   But even the locals don't differentiate. ``We're in New Mexico _
I think. I'm never quite sure,'' says a festival volunteer at
Anthony Park in the center of town.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're standing in Texas,'' another says at the same site.
</P>
<P>
   No quirk of nature blessed Anthony with more leap-year babies
per capita than anyplace else. (Statistically, one of every 1,461
people is a leaper.) But this quiet town, population 3,500 or so in
Texas, seized the notion of a festival in 1988, when Mary Ann
Brown, now 17 leap years old, proposed it to the Chamber of
Commerce.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our chamber through the years had kicked around having some
kind of celebration,'' she says. ``Some members plain didn't want
to do the work, and we couldn't agree on any.''
</P>
<P>
   When she suggested the idea to the chamber, ``They kind of all
looked at each other. But there was a man named David who'd been
sent out here to be head of the Alpo dog food plant, and he said,
`Well, I think it sounds like a good idea.'''
</P>
<P>
   Thus, the Worldwide Leap Year Birthday Club was formed, and
Anthony proclaimed itself Leap Year Capital of the World.
</P>
<P>
   ``This community should get down on its knees and thank (Brown)
for what she's done,'' says Jan Risher, a former resident and
volunteer.
</P>
<P>
   About 60 29ers attended the 1996 party. But several thousand
others turned out for the festivities. This year's four-day bash,
which concludes Tuesday, drew 29ers from as far away as
Switzerland. The events include a golf and fishing tournament, hot
air balloon rides, a chuckwagon breakfast, 5K walk and 10K run,
wine tasting, parade, concerts and an arts and crafts fair.
</P>
<P>
   The kicker Tuesday night is a performance by Graham Nash of
Crosby, Stills, Nash &AMP; Young; Nash's wife is a 29er.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
`IT'S MY BIRTHDAY' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Whose idea it was to come here? It wasn't his,'' Susan Nash
says of her husband as she strolls into the lobby of the Holiday
Inn Express on the interstate.
</P>
<P>
   Graham had complained, ``You know, we're shutting this whole
tour down for your birthday, it's costing us a lot of money.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's my birthday,'' she replied.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, I'm not playing in a high school gymnasium.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But it's my birthday.''
</P>
<P>
   So that was Graham Nash, looking like anything but a rock star,
signing autographs in Anthony Park on Sunday. He had flown in after
performing in Minneapolis while his green-and-silver tour bus was
driven from an earlier Denver concert the day before to pick up
Susan, her mother, their son and friends at the El Paso airport.
</P>
<P>
   The Nash entourage wore matching &UR;  &LR; olive green sweatshirts
imprinted with Susan's birth certificate. The birthday queen, a
first-timer in Anthony, also wore a crown her daughter had earned
in an AIDS walkathon.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seemed like a good idea. What else are you going to do? I
don't think you can come down here and be serious about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Susan has gotten a kick out of Anthony, and her son is
videotaping the proceedings. ``This is a pretty cute little event,
isn't it? We're good in small towns. We fit in real well.''
</P>
<P>
   The Nashes maintain homes in Los Angeles and on the Hawaiian
Island of Kauai.
</P>
<P>
   It is remarkable that Graham is even on tour or in Anthony. Or
that he participated in Monday's golf tournament. Five months ago
he broke both legs in a boating accident when he lost his balance
on a wave. They were shattered, Susan says, like Rice Krispies.
</P>
<P>
   She went into shock. ``I couldn't face him, his feet going the
wrong way, his face gray. I didn't know if he was paralyzed or was
going to have a stroke. When your husband's always been `so there,'
to see him that vulnerable ...''
</P>
<P>
   The tour had been already scheduled, and Graham willed himself
to make it. ``I'm sure he made it happen. I cried to see him walk
out there.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
A LEAP-YEAR FAMILY &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Jesse and Diane Perez are as excited as their daughter, Jesika,
3 leap years old. Along with their other children, Jacob and
Jacqueline, they will be attending Tuesday's leap-year parade. &UR;  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   ``We're getting them out of school early, but they're A/B honor
roll,'' says Diane, a substitute teacher for the El Paso
Independent School District.
</P>
<P>
   Jesse, an emergency medical technician at El Paso International
Airport, is also making time for family. ``I'm starting my four-day
weekend. I'd normally go back Tuesday, but I'm taking it off
because it's my daughter's birthday. She's been waiting a long time
for this day.''
</P>
<P>
   A leap-year family must occasionally live in multiples of four.
``You've heard of quinceanera (the 15th birthday celebration),''
Diane says. ``With Jesika, it's going to be a Sweet Sixteen.''
</P>
<P>
   Angie Vincent, 18 leap years old, is visiting from Grand Rapids,
Mich., with her husband, Eugene, a retired firefighter, and an
extended family of 12. They're folding her birthday into the annual
family reunion that began in 1986 after the death of three
relatives.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've seen more of each other the last few years than we did
for a lot of years,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Susan O'Brien, a secretary in the Department of Justice in El
Paso, is 14 leap years old Tuesday. Growing up in North Platte,
Neb., she basked in being the only leap-year child in school _
until the sixth grade.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was upset, because it was my birthday, and I didn't want to
share it with him.''
</P>
<P>
   A teen-ager's need to conform didn't unnerve her, she says. ``I
think you want to look like everybody else, and you want to go to
the same places, see the same movies, but really, to have something
that differentiates you _ it was fun.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Brien will attend the Graham Nash concert, but that was not
the drawing card. ``Meeting the other people is the thing. You have
something in common. It's a starting point for conversation. It's a
lot better than `What's your sign?'''
</P>
<P>
   Don Porto, who arrived at 5 a.m. Saturday in his motor home,
wouldn't have missed it for a job. In fact, he risked a new
contract to come to Anthony for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   ``They wanted me, and I said, only under one condition. You can
write it right on the contract: I'm going.''

&HT;     COURT TO DECIDE IF SECRET DRUG TESTS ON PREGNANT WOMEN ARE
LEGAL 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By MARK HELM  
 &HT;     c. 2000 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Supreme Court agreed Monday to decide whether
public hospitals can test pregnant women for drugs without their
consent and tell the police which ones tested positive.
</P>
<P>
   The court will examine a challenge to a Charleston, S.C.,
hospital's program designed to find pregnant women who use drugs,
especially crack cocaine.
</P>
<P>
   The hospital suspended the practice in 1993 after being sued by
10 women who had been patients there but has stated it will
consider reinstating it if the Supreme Court approves.
</P>
<P>
   The women claimed the practice violated their Fourth Amendment
protections against unreasonable searches.
</P>
<P>
   The court's decision, which is expected late this year or early
next year, could determine whether the hospital can reinstate the
program and whether other hospitals can use similar procedures.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question before the court is whether pregnant women have
lesser constitutional rights than other Americans, and, as a
result, can be searched for evidence of a crime in their private
doctor's office without Fourth Amendment protection,'' said Simon
Heller, director of litigation at the Center for Reproductive Law
and Policy. The center is a New York City-based legal and advocacy
group.
</P>
<P>
   The Medical University of South Carolina, a public hospital in
Charleston, began the program in 1989. It was an effort to help
prosecute women who use drugs under a state law that makes it a
crime for mothers to refuse to provide proper care for their
children to the point where the child is ``endangered.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1989 the South Carolina Supreme Court ruled that a viable
fetus _ one able to live outside the uterus _ is protected by the
child-endangerment law and that the statute could be used against
pregnant women.
</P>
<P>
   No other state's top court has allowed similar use of
child-endangerment laws, and the highest courts in Florida,
Kentucky, Nevada and Ohio have explicitly disallowed them.
</P>
<P>
   Under the hospital's program, if a woman's urine test indicated
cocaine use, she would be arrested for distributing the drug to a
minor.
</P>
<P>
   In early 1990 the program was changed to give drug-using
patients a choice between being arrested and enrolling for drug
treatment. In suing the hospital in 1993, the 10 women contended
that the urine testing, which was performed without court warrants,
amounted to unreasonable searches that violated their privacy.
</P>
<P>
   After a six-week trial, a federal jury ruled against the women.
The Fourth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld that verdict last
July.
</P>
<P>
   ``In light of the documented health hazards of maternal cocaine
use and the resulting drain on public resources, (hospital)
officials unquestionably possessed a substantial interest in taking
steps to reduce cocaine use by pregnant women,'' the appeals court
ruled.
</P>
<P>
   The appeals court also said the urine tests were ``minimally
intrusive'' and that the hospital's policy helped protect unborn
children.
</P>
<P>
   The appeals court concluded that the searches were
constitutional under a ``special needs'' exception to the Fourth
Amendment's requirement that a search must be authorized by court
warrant or based on ``probable cause'' to suspect a crime.
</P>
<P>
   But Heller argued that the appeals court took the ``special
needs'' exception too far in this case.
</P>
<P>
   ``The appeals court would permit law enforcement and other
governmental officers to engage in searches as a means of gaining
evidence for arrests and prosecutions without a warrant or
individualized suspicion, so long as the government can present a
health or safety reason for its actions,'' he said.

 &HT;    Fortune unveils 'hip' new substitute market indexes
 &HT;    By Tom Walker
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Do the traditional stock market indexes tell us what's
really happening on Wall Street? The editors of Fortune (March 13)
didn't think so and came up with two of their own. They are
introduced in the magazine's 70th anniversary issue that goes on
newsstands March 6.
</P>
<P>
   The Fortune 500 Index is based on the magazine's famous annual
list of the 500 biggest companies ranked by revenue. The magazine
says a size-based index is more objective than the Standard &AMP;
Poor's 500, which is based on subjective decisions as to which
companies should be in the index.
</P>
<P>
   The other index is a product of the ``new economy,'' the Fortune
e-50 index of companies that are ``shaping the Internet economy.''
The index includes e-companies such as America Online and Yahoo,
communications companies such as AT&AMP;T and MCI WorldCom, software
and service companies such as Microsoft and Oracle and hardware
companies such as IBM and Lucent Technologies.
</P>
<P>
   Bethany McLean, author of the article describing these indexes,
said Fortune established them because ``new economic conditions
demand a new set of measurements.'' She said the current indexes
``aren't hip enough for the new century.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Not only is the Dow (Jones industrial average) way too tiny _
a mere 30 stocks _ but it is also weighed down by the remnants of
industrial America, making it no longer relevant to huge swatches
of the stock market,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   RUTHLESS EFFICIENCY
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Wal-Mart, the retail behemoth, have suffered recently
with other stocks that make up the Dow Jones industrial average.
But a Worth (March) profile of the company finds ``a ruthlessly
efficient retail machine'' beneath the company's ``corny yellow
smiley-face mascot.''
</P>
<P>
   Wal-Mart has dealt heavy blows to competitors such as Kmart and
Sears, and all by itself accounts for 1.5 percent of U.S. gross
domestic product, the magazine says. For investors, the downside is
the company's lofty market valuation. But on balance, Worth says
Wal-Mart ``should be a core, long-term holding in every
growth-oriented portfolio.''
</P>
<P>
   HARD LABOR IN ATLANTA
</P>
<P>
   Metro Atlanta's economy has gotten a big boost from thousands of
foreign workers, many of them Latinos from Mexico. But Business to
Business (March), an Atlanta business magazine, says their living
conditions are often poor.
</P>
<P>
   ``And because many are in the country illegally, they're cheated
out of wages and exploited by some employers. For too many
immigrant workers, legal or not, earning the American dream in
Atlanta is hard labor,'' the magazine says.
</P>
<P>
   Worth mentioning ...
</P>
<P>
   _ Business Week (March 6) looks for the Federal Reserve to raise
interest rates several more times this year, since ``for the first
time in years, risks are cropping up in the inflation outlook.''
</P>
<P>
   _ With tax time fast approaching, Forbes (March 6) warns that
``con artists are peddling bogus trusts to people seeking tax
shelters.'' When those shams implode, Forbes adds, ``the IRS isn't
sympathetic to the taxpayers who fell for them.''

 &HT;    FLOOD-DAMAGED CARS BEING SOLD OUTSIDE NORTH CAROLINA
 &HT;    360&AMP;add.
 &HT;    By GINGER LIVINGSTON
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Used car buyers across the United States are being
warned that the great deal they are being offered may be all wet.
</P>
<P>
   North Carolina vehicles caught in flooding caused by Hurricane
Floyd last September are starting to pop up on used car lots across
the United States, said Jason King, a spokesman with the American
Association of Motor Vehicle Administrators.
</P>
<P>
   Because it is not always easy to find out if a vehicle was
damaged during flooding, the AAMVA is providing some information on
the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Car buyers can log on to www.aamva.org and learn if the vehicle
they want to buy came from North Carolina and if it was in the
Hurricane Floyd flooding, King said.
</P>
<P>
   The AAMVA links to the North Carolina attorney general's Web
site, which lists vehicle identification numbers of
``water-damaged'' or ``flood'' vehicles, King said.
</P>
<P>
   There is no uniform federal definition for ``water-damaged''
vehicles, King said. That means a vehicle with a ``flood'' title
listing in North Carolina may not have that listing on its title in
another state, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The North Carolina definition of a ``water-damaged'' or
``flood'' title vehicle is a vehicle that has ``been submerged or
partially submerged in water to the extent that damage to the body,
engine, transmission or differential has occurred.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem we've found is it usually takes six months to a
year for these cars to be repaired (and) to be sold,'' said Ashley
Westbrook, a spokeswoman for the North Carolina attorney general's
office.
</P>
<P>
   More than 8,000 North Carolina vehicles were issued flood
titles, said George Leggett, an investigator with the attorney
general's office.
</P>
<P>
   ``Between 60 to 70 percent are no longer in North Carolina. They
have been sold to wholesalers outside the state,'' Leggett said.
</P>
<P>
   One Arkansas wholesaler reportedly bought between 2,500 to 3,000
vehicles with flood titles, Leggett said. It appears the cars are
being prepared for shipment to Texas and Colorado, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Large numbers of cars are also appearing in Tennessee and
Florida, he said.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Leggett refused to comment on whether any wholesalers who
purchased flood title vehicles are under investigation. Unless the
vehicle is sold in North Carolina, Leggett said, his office had no
jurisdiction.
</P>
<P>
   The attorney general's office has received five written
complaints and five calls from consumers who believe they had
purchased a flood-damaged vehicle, Westbrook said.
</P>
<P>
   The North Carolina attorney general's Web site cautions its
listing is not a complete listing of the damaged vehicles. The list
is from the state Division of Motor Vehicles, and the agency is
relying on insurance companies and vehicle owners to notify them
that a car has been damaged by water or flood.
</P>
<P>
   More than 40,000 vehicles were damaged during the Hurricane
Floyd flooding. Not every vehicle was given a flood title, Leggett
said. Some were repaired and others were issued salvaged titles, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   People who suspect their newly purchased used vehicles may have
come from North Carolina can receive a complete title history by
calling the North Carolina Division of Motor Vehicles customer
service line at 919-715-7000 (a toll call) to receive a request for
motor vehicle information application.
</P>
<P>
   The application can also be downloaded from the AAMVA Web site.

 &HT;    McCain rips into Falwell, Robertson and Bush
 &HT;    By Mark Sherman and Ken Herman
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   VIRGINIA BEACH, Va. _ Arizona Sen. John McCain on Monday tore
into Pat Robertson and Jerry Falwell, eager to turn the religious
right leaders into Gov. George W. Bush's cross to bear as the GOP
presidential battle moves into a crucial week.
</P>
<P>
   On the eve of today's primaries in Virginia and Washington
state, and caucuses in North Dakota, McCain branded Bush-backers
Robertson and Falwell as ``agents of intolerance.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We are the party of Ronald Reagan, not Pat Robertson,'' McCain
said. ``We are the party of Abraham Lincoln, not Bob Jones.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, Governor Bush is a Pat Robertson Republican who
will lose to Al Gore,'' he predicted.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, campaigning in Bellevue, Washington, accused McCain of
trying to turn a political battle into a fractious religious war.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is playing the religion card. That is not Reaganesque,''
said Bush. Bush said the McCain campaign, as it did in Michigan, is
making telephone calls to tell Washington voters that Bush's Feb. 2
appearance at Bob Jones University in South Carolina makes Bush
anti-Catholic. Jones believes Catholicism and Mormonism are
``cults.''
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to Cardinal John O'Connor of New York, and other
Catholic leaders, Bush has said he regrets not condemning the
anti-Catholic policy during his speech at the fundamentalist
school.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, who frequently tells audiences a person can be judged by
the company he keeps, said Monday he should not be defined by his
backing from Robertson, founder of the Christian Coalition, and
Falwell, founder of the Moral Majority.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're supporters of mine, but I've got all kinds of
supporters,'' Bush said. ``What the Republican Party needs is to
have somebody who can unite our party.'' Monday's action came as
both candidates battled for 87 delegates available today in
Washington, Virginia and North Dakota. Next Tuesday, battles in 12
states will determine the allocation of more than half the
delegates needed to win the nomination.
</P>
<P>
   In addressing the significance of what McCain said Monday, one
of his top strategists, John Weaver, said: ``This is a defining
moment for our party and for our campaign. We're at a fork in the
road. The party can choose the well marked path of ... exclusion
and ultimate defeat, the path George W. Bush is taking with Jerry
Falwell and Pat Robertson as his Lewis and Clark. Or we can choose
a new path of inclusion that will produce a Republican victory and
sweeping majority in November.''
</P>
<P>
   In his Virginia Beach speech, McCain mentioned Bush just once by
name but made it clear that he wants Bush to be boxed in as a
candidate tied so closely to the religious right that his
nomination would ensure a Democratic victory in November.
</P>
<P>
   In primaries so far, McCain has fared poorly among Republican
voters while picking up unprecedented support from independents and
Democrats in states with open primaries. The March 7 primaries in
California and New York are limited to registered Republicans, and
McCain is hoping that the more moderate Republican voters who are
numerous in those states will reject Bush's ties to religious
conservative leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Robertson and Falwell, both based in southern Virginia, so fear
McCain's efforts to change campaign finance laws that they have
attacked him as a disloyal Republican and question his commitment
to conservative policies.
</P>
<P>
   Roberta Combs, executive vice president of the Christian
Coalition, which Robertson founded, called McCain's remarks ``a
transparent effort to divide one American from another on the basis
of religion'' and predicted the group's conservative message would
draw record numbers of
</P>
<P>
   voters to the polls. There was no immediate response from
Falwell, founder of the Moral Majority.
</P>
<P>
   ``They distort my pro-life positions and smear the reputations
of my supporters,'' McCain said, adding that he represents the
GOP's best chance to become a majority party. He said the criticism
from Falwell and Robertson ``surprises me, since the essence of
evangelism is to seek converts.''
</P>
<P>
   ``My campaign is bringing new people into the Republican Party
every day. I don't apologize for this. No, I wear it as a badge of
honor,'' McCain said.
</P>
<P>
   McCain compared Robertson and Falwell to ``union bosses.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Neither party should be defined by pandering to the outer
reaches of American politics and the agents of intolerance, whether
they be Louis Farrakhan or Al Sharpton, on the left, or Pat
Robertson and Jerry Falwell on the right,'' McCain said in speech
to about 1,500 people at Cox High School.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's gambit counts on a belief that many Republicans are
tired of the influence of Robertson and other religious leaders in
determining their party's nominee.
</P>
<P>
   For McCain, there may not be much to lose. Long before Monday's
speech, the religious right was fully mobilized against McCain.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their intensity level already is a 10,'' said McCain campaign
manager Rick Davis.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, McCain was careful to confine his remarks to
leaders in the religious conservative movement.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not an attack on Christian right voters,'' he told
reporters.
</P>
<P>
   At McCain's side was Gary Bauer, the Christian conservative who
ended his Republican presidential campaign earlier this month and
endorsed McCain.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this were an attack on Christian conservative voters, I
wouldn't be here. '' Bauer told reporters Monday.
</P>
<P>
   For Bush, the McCain effort to glue him to the religious right
is a strange twist of political fate. The Christian Coalition was
never enamored of Bush's father and have been, at times, lukewarm
to Bush's tenure as governor.
</P>
<P>
   In June 1998, at the Texas Republican Convention at which Bush
was a political deity, he was absent and unmentioned at the Texas
Christian Coalition's big banquet.
</P>
<P>
   On the banquet buffet line that day, Christian Coalition members
like Sam Gaines of San Antonio expressed concern about Bush's
``degree'' of commitment to their cause.
</P>
<P>
   ``He may be articulating it, but I'm not hearing it,'' Gaines
said at the time.

UNION TOEHOLD IN EAST TEXAS WAL-MART LIFTS LABOR'S HOPES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BARRY SHLACHTER 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   JACKSONVILLE, Texas _ All Maurice Miller, a Wal-Mart meat
cutter, wanted was a $2-an-hour raise.
</P>
<P>
   When he didn't get it, the barrel-chested butcher took on the
nation's biggest retailer _ and won.
</P>
<P>
   In, of all places, anti-union East Texas, Miller, 45, organized
the country's first successful union vote in a Wal-Mart store. In
the labor movement, the chance of getting a toehold in Wal-Mart is
akin to the loss-prone Chicago Cubs sweeping the World Series. The
Arkansas-based chain, founded by Sam Walton, had tenaciously fought
unionization for decades without losing a battle until now.
</P>
<P>
   Wal-Mart's problems began when, on the assurance of a promised
pay raise, Miller took out a loan for a new pickup.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I was promoted and got that $2 an hour, I wouldn't even
have thought union,'' said Miller, a ponytailed man with 24 years'
experience who lost the tip of his ring finger in a work-related
accident. ``I'd be happy as gold. I just don't appreciate being
lied to.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the 10 eligible meat cutters, seven voted for union
representation on Feb. 17, despite Wal-Mart's ``open door''
approach to labor relations and profit sharing, which the company
says alleviates the need for unions.
</P>
<P>
   The 1.4-million-strong United Food &AMP; Commercial Workers union
sees the East Texas chapter as a crucial foothold and believes that
unionization will quickly spread, noting moves toward a union vote
in nearby Palestine and preparations in Tyler.
</P>
<P>
   Grapevine-based organizer Brad Edwards said many Wal-Mart
employees in the Fort Worth-Dallas areas and elsewhere have called.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any time you get a toehold or a foothold, it is significant,''
said professor David A. Larson, 45, an expert of labor law and
dispute resolution at Hamline University School of Law in St. Paul,
Minn.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's sort of like scaffolding or cracking the citadel,''
Larson said. ``People will hear about this and get empowered. And
if it happens in a place like Texas, a right-to-work state not
historically sympathetic to labor, they will think they'd have a
respectable chance anywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Wal-Mart emphasizes that only 10 of the store's 350 employees
participated in the vote, and the company says it is challenging
the ballot result. If it gets no satisfaction with the National
Labor Relations Board, it will try the courts, spokeswoman Jessica
Moser said from the company's headquarters in Bentonville, Ark.
</P>
<P>
   ``If our store as a whole voted, the outcome would have been
different,'' Moser said. ``We know and they know they don't have
support in these stores. Thus, they are limiting the vote to a
small handful of associates.''
</P>
<P>
   The company cites ``sexual titillation'' as an inducement to
vote pro-union.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing to these objections,'' said the United Food &AMP;
Commercial Workers' Edwards, who said a meat cutter had asked him
to meet at his regular hangout, a topless bar. ``They're fishing.
The workers stood up for the union.''
</P>
<P>
   The union won the right to organize by so-called ``appropriate
units'' of, say, in-store meat cutters, pharmacists or optical
staff members while trying to win a vote at a Wal-Mart in
Jerseyville, Ill. But Wal-Mart got the vote delayed for two years
through legal challenges. By then, pro-union staff had left through
natural turnover, the union said.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Jacksonville store is the first with a unionized
unit in the United States, there has been one union Wal-Mart in
Canada since 1996. Stores in Germany and elsewhere overseas are
unionized, said Moser, emphasizing that unions mean different
things in different countries.
</P>
<P>
   The union victory in this traditionally anti-union East Texas
town of 12,765 about 27 miles south of Tyler has left residents
``scratching their heads,'' said Mike Traylor, 40, sales manager of
the Texas Basket Co.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an aberration, a fluke,'' said Mike McEwan, 54, who owns
Cherokee Real Estate Co. ``Jacksonville is an unsophisticated,
essentially blue-collar community where the consensus, I would dare
say, is that unions are pernicious and wreak havoc on the local
economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that with the right seed, the right individual, it
could have happened anywhere,'' said McEwan, a former personnel
specialist with the Beall's apparel chain. ``If what Miller said
was true, the seed was a disingenuous supervisor who did not
realize the consequence of his insincerity. The guy was wronged and
felt it needed righting.
</P>
<P>
   ``In these small communities, false cohesiveness keeps the
peace. It could be an unhappy family down there,'' he said of
Wal-Mart.
</P>
<P>
   And he's apparently right.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Stewart, who voted against the union, churned out 200
anti-union badges on his computer and passed them out apparently
with management's blessing. His pro-union colleagues in the meat
department no longer greet him, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Moses didn't do anything when he split the seas compared to
the situation here,'' Stewart said.

 &HT;    February's last day or lost day?
 &HT;    By Chris Hutchins
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Today, Betty Bell turns 19. She doesn't
look a day over 70.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to teach high school, and I used to tell the kids I was
younger than them,'' the Boynton Beach resident says. ``But no one
believed me.''
</P>
<P>
   Bell was born Feb. 29, leap day. Her birthday comes only once
every four years. If that makes her a little ornery, it's payback
for all those lost birthday presents.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been given a raw deal,'' Bell says. ``There has never
been enough publicity about these poor people who are born on Feb.
29 and get short-changed every year.''
</P>
<P>
   One in every 1,461 people is a leap day baby. There are about
200,000 in America, 4 million worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   Some of those folks, who call themselves ``leapers'' and
``29ers,'' have become leap day evangelists. Take the dusty town of
Anthony, on the Texas/New Mexico border. After encouragement from a
local leap baby, it was proclaimed ``Leap Year Capital of the
World'' in 1988. The town of 10,000 hosts a festival each leap day.
</P>
<P>
   This year's is the biggest yet, says Ruth Ashby, president of
the Anthony Chamber of Commerce. In commemoration of the first-ever
millennial leap year, and the first centennial leap year since
1600, the town is pulling out the stops. There'll be a leaping
contest over the Texas/New Mexico border, and Graham Nash _ of
Crosby, Stills &AMP; Nash _ will perform.
</P>
<P>
   But despite the festivities, 29ers think there's something
rotten in the state of Texas. And New Mexico. And every other
commonwealth, state and sovereign nation around the world. Look at
the box marked ``Feb. 29'' on your calendar. You'll see what
they're talking about.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing's there. No logo, no insignia, no mention that this day
_ today _ is leap day.
</P>
<P>
   That ticks Ashby off.
</P>
<P>
   ``None of them have it,'' the sister of a leaper says. ``It's
not even acknowledged on the calendars, much less celebrated.''
</P>
<P>
   Could this be true? You betcha. Phone calls to calendar
companies confirmed Ashby's complaint. Four admitted they had never
seen a calendar that gave leap day its due.
</P>
<P>
   One representative fell on his sword: ``I honestly have had no
idea'' why the recognition isn't there, said Linda Starr,
acquisitions director at Cedco Publishing in San Rafael, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Another went down swinging: ``This is a design decision,'' said
Susan Shearer, owner of Minneapolis-based Shearer Calendars. ``I
think if you start listing every possible thing in the boxes, there
won't be any room in the grid for people to write down plans.''
</P>
<P>
   Tell that to 29ers and they'll point out there's nothing else to
put on Feb. 29. In fact, prominent members of the leaper community
suspect it's something more than a ``design decision,'' something a
bit more insidious _ something, perhaps, like a calendar company
conspiracy.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what we think,'' Ashby says. ``We're on a campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   So is Raenell Dawn. The Salem, Ore., resident is the co-founder
of the Honor Society of Leap Day Babies. For the past 16 years, the
29er has been trying to persuade calendar companies to change.
She's lost count of the letters, calls and e-mails she's sent out.
</P>
<P>
   But she remembers how many replies she's gotten.
</P>
<P>
   ``None,'' she says. ``I've never heard back from any of them.
And I contact them in plenty of time: One or two years in
advance.... People don't take this seriously. People think this is
some kind of a joke.''
</P>
<P>
   Calendar representatives denied any complaints, and one even
chuckled at the idea.
</P>
<P>
   ``The poor dears,'' said Joni Miller, a calendar editor for the
Workman Publishing Group in New York City. ``It must be very
distressing for them.''
</P>
<P>
   It is.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it weren't for leap day, we'd be celebrating Christmas in
the summer and planting crops in the winter,'' Ashby says. ``Not
having that day marked on the calendar robs our young people of a
significant part of their education.''
</P>
<P>
   But one publisher is prepared to help.
</P>
<P>
   Sundance Press Inc., a company based in El Paso, Texas, printed
this year's El Paso Sunrise Rotary Club calendar. In the box of
Feb. 29, there is a cartoon of a man blowing a horn. The
inscription beside it: ``Leap Day!''
</P>
<P>
   That was president Michael Moses' call.
</P>
<P>
   ``Actually, I've worked with the people in Anthony,'' he said.
``I did it on the basis that I would be able to meet Graham Nash.''
</P>
<P>
   A hollow victory, but leapers haven't lost hope. If enough 29ers
start to rally, they think, the industry will listen. They could be
right.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are very concerned about what our customers think,''
insisted Susan Krick, general manager for calendars.com. ``We want
to make people happy. If that's what the public wants, and that's
what the outcry is, we'll do it.''
</P>
<P>
   But Miller is skeptical.
</P>
<P>
   ``I suspect the leap day lobby needs to find itself a celebrity
born on that day,'' she said. ``That way, they might be able to
finesse the calendar companies.''
</P>
<P>
   OK, how about Italian superhunk Antonio Sabato Jr.? The
1972-born 29er would be the perfect poster boy: heartthrob, action
star (he was in ``The Big Hit''), father.
</P>
<P>
   Don't wait by the phone, says his publicist.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just don't think it's something Antonio would like to be
deemed the spokesperson for,'' Craig Schneider, of Kane and
Associates, says. ``Sorry.''
</P>
<P>
   That's not going to stop Dawn; she'll keep writing those
companies. The show will go on in Anthony, Ashby says. And Betty
Bell will be partying with 100 friends at a country club in Boca
Raton tonight.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, I used to get upset, because I really felt
shortchanged,'' she says, smiling. ``I only had three birthdays
before I was 16. But after that, it's a blessing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I mean, who wants people to know how old you are after 20?''

11-YEAR-OLD DESERVES HIS OSCAR NOD
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROBERT PHILPOT 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   After the Academy Awards nominations were announced last week,
gossip columnist (and Fort Worth native) Liz Smith kvetched about
Haley Joel Osment's nomination for Best Supporting Actor for ``The
Sixth Sense.'' It's not fair, Smith contended, that veterans such
as Tom Cruise should have to compete with an 11-year-old who was
virtually unknown till last year, despite having worked on TV and
in movies since 1994. Cruise and fellow nominee Michael Caine have
worked hard over the years; why should they have to worry about
losing to a kid?
</P>
<P>
   This would be fine logic if the Best Supporting Actor award were
a lifetime achievement award. It isn't _ at least, it's not
supposed to be. But the academy has a way of bestowing Oscars on
people who've been passed over in the past, a tendency that favors
Cruise, who was nominated for his performance as an incredibly
piggish men's-group leader in ``Magnolia.''
</P>
<P>
   Cruise is that oddest of underdogs _ the superstar who spends
much of his career trying to earn respect on his merits, not for
his magazine covers _ and he has been nominated twice before, for
Best Actor in ``Born on the Fourth of July'' and ``Jerry Maguire.''
The academy might be more willing to give him a supporting actor
win, and it doesn't hurt that his ``Magnolia'' performance is
arguably his most acclaimed.
</P>
<P>
   Strangely, though, the character he plays could hurt him. Cruise
is maybe a little too convincing as Frank T.J. Mackey, the type of
guy who sees women as receptacles and is foul-mouthed enough to
singe the most jaded ears; it's an abrasive role that has led to
some of ``Magnolia's'' walkouts.
</P>
<P>
   Contrast that with Osment, who endeared himself to audiences
with his turn as the haunted little boy in ``The Sixth Sense.''
Osment's appeal was apparent even in the movie's trailers, which
focused on his increasing fright; the movie went further, revealing
the young actor's instinct for compassion. Most important, though,
is that ``Sixth Sense'' hinged on Osment's performance;
``Magnolia,'' an ensemble piece, could have lived without Cruise.
</P>
<P>
   You could also say that the success of ``The Green Mile'' hinged
on a performance, that of nominee Michael Clarke Duncan as a Death
Row inmate with miraculous healing powers. This is the first time
in five years that African-Americans have been nominated in two
major categories (the other being Denzel Washington's nod for Best
Actor for ``The Hurricane''), and although Duncan is excellent,
cynics may say his nomination is a response to recent criticism of
the academy for neglecting black actors. Backlash is just as likely
to hurt Duncan, though, as several critics have panned ``The Green
Mile'' for its story about a slow-witted black man who becomes a
savior for some unusually progressive white guards.
</P>
<P>
   Duncan's odds look better than Michael Caine's, though. Caine is
solid as a kindly New England abortionist in ``The Cider House
Rules,'' the first time the British actor has played an American.
But he already has a win under his belt, for 1986's ``Hannah and
Her Sisters,'' and he seems unlikely to gain a second Oscar in a
year when the competition is so strong.
</P>
<P>
   It would be more of an upset, however, if Jude Law won for his
role as a privileged young man in ``The Talented Mr. Ripley.'' Some
critics even said that Law and his co-star Matt Damon were miscast,
and that Law should have played the lead role, a not-so-privileged
young man who desires the good life so much that he's willing to
kill to get it.
</P>
<P>
   This is nonsense. Damon, his blinding smile aside, still has a
touch of the working-class attitude that he displayed in ``Good
Will Hunting;'' he looks like the type of guy who would envy a
glamour boy like Law. If anything, the nominations should have been
switched _ this is Damon's best performance, and he seemed like a
good bet for a Best Actor nod. But he was passed over, and Law was
acknowledged in this category instead. He seemed like not just a
surprise, but an afterthought.
</P>
<P>
   Prediction: Tom Cruise rides academy good will to a victory.
</P>
<P>
   Personal pick: Osment may be young, but his performance is the
best in this category this year.

BUSH MOVES TO THE MIDDLE TO ATTRACT MODERATES IN WASHINGTON STATE

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASCO, Wash. _ Continuing a prolonged zag to the political
middle, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas campaigned furiously in
Washington state on Monday and reached out to moderate voters by
focusing on issues such as education and tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to large and enthusiastic audiences in one gymnasium
after another here in Washington, which votes on Tuesday, Bush
sounded conciliatory and inclusive themes that are likely to play
well in forthcoming contests.
</P>
<P>
   After the South Carolina victory, aides complained that his
rival, Sen. John McCain of Arizona, was defining Bush as an
intolerant, far-right candidate, and the governor now seems
determined to position himself more firmly in the middle.
</P>
<P>
   In his speeches Monday, Bush focused his scorn on Vice President
Al Gore and the Clinton administration.
</P>
<P>
   But in answer to questions about McCain's criticism of his ties
to the Christian right, and in a media briefing, Bush mocked McCain
as a negative campaigner and said the senator's style was very
different from that of President Ronald Reagan, whose heir both
candidates claim to be.
</P>
<P>
   ``He claims he's a Reagan Republican,'' Bush said here in Pasco,
a town in the rural eastern side of Washington. ``Ronald Reagan
didn't run those kinds of campaigns.''
</P>
<P>
   At another appearance, Bush said: ``Ronald Reagan didn't point
fingers. He never played to people's religious fears, as Senator
McCain has shamelessly done.''
</P>
<P>
   Referring to phone calls placed to Catholics, taking Bush to
task for not criticizing the anti-Catholic views of some of his
supporters, Bush declared, ``Senator McCain should be ashamed of
making those phone calls.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bush campaign also charged that those calls were being made
to voters in Washington state and Virginia. ``It appears to be a
stealth campaign,'' said Karen Hughes, a spokesman for Bush.
</P>
<P>
   In his speeches, Bush emphasized his ideas for raising standards
in public schools and his own experience in Texas on revising the
school system. Bush spoke sympathetically about charter schools and
home schooling, and he argued that any school that gets federal
money should have three years to attain acceptable standards for
its pupils.
</P>
<P>
   After that, he said, the money should be taken from the school
and given to the parents so that they could send their children
elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Bush also called for legislation that would protect teachers and
principals from what he called frivolous lawsuits arising from
attempts to maintain classroom discipline. He said that schools
should teach more about character as well.
</P>
<P>
   Often, Bush sounded inclusive themes, mentioning concern for
minorities or single mothers, in front of audiences that appeared
virtually entirely white and well-heeled.
</P>
<P>
   ``This Republican Party better have people who not only hear the
entrepreneurs, we better have someone who hears the voices on the
outskirts of poverty as well,'' Bush told one packed audience at a
school.
</P>
<P>
   When Bush spoke about the importance of faith in providing hope
to people's lives, he went out of his way to refer inclusively to
``churches, synagogues and mosques.'' He talked about summoning
``the armies of compassion'' from faith-based groups to help people
having trouble with drugs or the law.
</P>
<P>
   He also showed off his Spanish, which is quite fluent, by firing
off a sentence in Spanish.
</P>
<P>
   In answer to foreign policy questions, Bush said he would
redefine America's relationship with China by ending what the
Clinton administration has called its ``strategic partnership''
with Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to say, we're not strategic partners but
competitors,'' Bush said. But he added that even competitors can
work together, and he emphasized that he intended to keep an open
trade relationship with China.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Asked about American commitments abroad, Bush said that American
troops were overdeployed and raised the issue of the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must work toward a political settlement,'' Bush said. But
it was not clear whether he meant that Washington should try and
reach a political settlement with Slobodan Milosevic, the hard-line
nationalist leader of Yugoslavia.

 &HT;     If you want to enjoy the parade, you'll need a shovel

<P>
   Just in time for our next big wave of presidential primaries
comes exciting news from Bangkok that researchers have found a way
to turn elephant dung into natural gas.
</P>
<P>
   The Thailand Ministry of Science's Bureau of Energy Development
and Production declared last week that fermented pachyderm
excrement makes a dandy, low-cost and environmentally sensitive
energy source, according to USA Today. The average elephant
produces 88 to 110 pounds of dung a day, which is roughly enough to
power the kitchen stove for a family of two or three.
</P>
<P>
   I don't know about you and yours, but my family of three was
cooking with gas just watching and reading about the GOP candidates
last week. They did their mascot proud.
</P>
<P>
   Front-runners George W. Bush and John McCain are growing
increasingly nasty in their fight for the nomination, so much so
that GOP leaders are warning the two men that their in-your-face
remarks could prove costly in the fall battle against the
Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   The same warning holds true for Democrats Al Gore and Bill
Bradley, who've generated a supply of alternative fuel at least
sufficient enough to prepare an after-dinner snack of popcorn.
</P>
<P>
   The crankiest member of the donkey squad of late has probably
been Bradley, whose campaign passed out fliers last week featuring
the candidate declaring, ``I won't spend my time attacking my
opponent on votes from long ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, in a debate hours later, he proceeded to blast Gore for a
series of votes from long ago, including one in 1981.
</P>
<P>
   On the Republican side, one of the most odoriferous moments last
week was Bush defending his decision to speak earlier this month at
Bob Jones University, a South Carolina school with a
less-than-glorious past or present.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1970s, the university lost its tax-exempt status for
refusing to admit blacks. Today, it accepts black students but
forbids them to date or marry whites. It bans gays and even
declares its property off-limits to alumni who later reveal they're
gay. The university's founding family once portrayed the pope as
the ``anti-Christ'' and the Catholic Church as a cult.
</P>
<P>
   For many politicians, those facts would make the school about as
inviting as a back slap from David Duke or a bear hug from Louis
Farrakhan, but Bush and others, including Alan Keyes (on
Valentine's Day, no less), paid a visit anyway.
</P>
<P>
   In the weeks since, Bush has been deluged with criticism from
McCain, among others, about the visit. Bush told The Washington
Post he made the right decision to attend because ``it also gives
me a chance to remind people what's wrong with that kind of
thinking. It gives me a chance to stand up and say, `I don't
support that kind of thinking.'''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Bush never really stood up and informed the Bob Jones
crowd he doesn't support that kind of thinking. He was too busy
slapping backs, giving bear hugs and asking for the votes. But
nearly a month after his South Carolina victory _ hoo boy _ he's
letting them have it.
</P>
<P>
   The Bob Jones visit stirred up a lot of trouble all the way out
in Michigan, where McCain triumphed last week, probably thanks in
part to phone calls reminding Catholic voters of the company Bush
kept in South Carolina. Initially, McCain denied his campaign aides
had anything to do with the calls, then admitted they did.
</P>
<P>
   Televangelist Pat Robertson and his minions, meanwhile, were
also busy on the phone in Michigan attacking Warren Rudman,
McCain's national chairman, as a ``vicious bigot.'' Robertson is
apparently appalled that Rudman once had the effrontery to
criticize the political views of the religious right.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Barry Lynn, executive director of Americans United for
Separation of Church and State, last week criticized the whole
Republican gang _ as well as Democrats _ for using religion as a
divisive weapon in the presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The timing is ironic, he said. ``Right now in Iran, voters are
trying to separate religion and politics. Unfortunately, here in
the United States, we appear to be going in the opposite
direction.''
</P>
<P>
   Ah, but we're exploring new energy sources. It may smell funny
now, but it'll blow over. Probably.

 &HT;     GOP GOVERNORS VOICE SUPPORT FOR McCAIN IF HE IS NOMINEE  
 &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)   
 &HT;     By STEWART M. POWELL   
 &HT;     c.2000 Hearst Newspapers   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Four Republican governors allied with Texas Gov.
George W. Bush said Monday they would work to elect Sen. John
McCain if he wins the hard-fought Republican presidential
nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the four governors urged Bush or McCain to choose the
runner-up as his vice presidential running mate to help unify the
GOP at the end of the fractious nomination struggle, just as Ronald
Reagan offered the No. 2 job to his rival George Bush in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Ridge Ridge, citing what he called the
``tremendous mutual respect'' between Bush and McCain, said a
ticket with both Bush and McCain would be ``a blockbuster ticket''
to regain the White House for the Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Colorado Gov. Bill Owens, recalling the salutary effect that a
Reagan-Bush ticket had on the divided Republican party in Colorado
in 1980, said it would be ``a rational and very unifying gesture
for either of these candidates to go to that second-rung candidate
and make that offer to unify the party.''
</P>
<P>
   Ridge and Owens, joined by Massachusetts Gov. Paul Cellucci and
Michigan Gov. John Engler, said that they would work tirelessly to
elect McCain president, in the event that the Arizona Republican
prevailed over Bush.
</P>
<P>
   McCain upset Bush in the Michigan and New Hampshire primaries,
sidetracking Bush's march for the GOP nomination. Bush is the clear
choice of the Republican establishment, having won endorsements
from 38 senators and 175 House members, in addition to 26 GOP
governors.
</P>
<P>
   Engler, a strong Bush supporter who suffered a stinging defeat
when McCain won the Michigan primary last week, said he would work
for McCain if the senator gets the nomination.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every Republican will say there are two words _ `Al Gore' _
and those two words make Alan Keyes, John McCain or George Bush
acceptable,'' said Engler, a three-term Michigan governor.
</P>
<P>
   Ridge said all GOP governors would support McCain ``as
aggressively as we could'' if McCain defeats Bush. Owens said he
would work to deliver Colorado for McCain because the Arizonan
would be ``an excellent president when compared to a Vice President
Gore or Sen. Bradley.''
</P>
<P>
   Cellucci, ceding that McCain is far ahead of Bush in
Massachusetts, said that he has no concerns about McCain's
temperament or ability to forge bipartisan unity to get things
done.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't fear him,'' Cellucci said in responses to a question.
``What I fear is what Al Gore will do to him if he is the nominee.
Al Gore will go after the 18-year record in Congress _ everything.
He'll attack him with a vengeance that's what I worry about.''
</P>
<P>
   The governors, in remarks to reporters, said they remain
confident that Bush will prevail over McCain as the presidential
primary calendar shifts to closed contests where only Republicans
can vote.
</P>
<P>
   But two GOP governors expressed concern about Bush's delayed
apology for an appearance at Bob Jones University in South Carolina
where the Texan failed to repudiate the school's anti-Catholic
teachings and prohibitions on inter-racial dating.
</P>
<P>
   Bush released a letter on Sunday to New York Cardinal John
O'Connor, the nation's most prominent Roman Catholic leader,
expressing regret that his Feb. 2 appearance at the predominantly
Baptist school was a ``missed opportunity, causing needless
offense, which I deeply regret.''
</P>
<P>
   Ridge, dubbing the issue ``more radioactive than plutonium,''
said he ``personally'' wished that Bush's repudiation had been
``louder and earlier.''
</P>
<P>
   But Ridge added that he did not expect Bush's appearance or
McCain's efforts to highlight the school's anti-Catholic teachings
would have much effect in Pennsylvania's primary, where Roman
Catholics are a large constituency.
</P>
<P>
   Cellucci said that Roman Catholics in Massachusetts are heavily
in favor of McCain already, due to the spillover effects of
McCain's victory in the Feb. 1 presidential primary in neighboring
New Hampshire. But Cellucci elliptically criticized Bush's efforts
to court southern Baptists in South Carolina who helped deliver
victory in the state's Feb. 19 contest.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think you bring your message everywhere,'' Cellucci said.
``You don't choose to bring it only to a certain part of the state;
you bring it everywhere. `'

 &HT;    UPN takes monster trucks to TV
 &HT;    By Kevin D. Thompson
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   FELLSMERE, Fla. _ Talk about a spectacular made-for-TV moment.
</P>
<P>
   A 10,000-pound mechanical beast roars around a muddy race
course, whipping 5,000 fans into a deafening frenzy. Scorpion, the
monster truck demon, is seconds away from beating Bigfoot, an
equally impressive souped-up truck, to the finish line.
</P>
<P>
   The sign-toting crowd (``Bigfoot is Mac Daddy!'' ``Vavoom,
baby!'') is on its feet. The pungent smell of burned rubber fills
the chilly night air.
</P>
<P>
   VROOOOOOOM!
</P>
<P>
   One last ramp remains. Scorpion hits it going 50 mph, but the
loose sand throws the truck off balance. Suddenly, the powerful rig
flips over twice, going down hard like a fallen T-Rex. Out rush the
police. An ambulance. The crowd is now hushed.
</P>
<P>
   Minutes later, the driver, Gene Patterson, walks out unhurt. He
smiles weakly, then waves to the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   And UPN has it all on tape.
</P>
<P>
   The upstart network known for pro wrestling is now turning its
sights on _ what else _ monster trucks. Its sweeps special,
``Monster Trux 2000: The New Thrillennium,'' which airs today at 9
p.m., was filmed here in this small town near Vero Beach.
</P>
<P>
   UPN hopes ``Monster Trux 2000'' gets monster ratings. Hosted by
fitness expert and Playboy model Jennifer Goodwin, the one-hour
special combines the bite-your-fingernails thrill of monster truck
racing with the outlandish soap opera-like plots seen on UPN's
wildly popular ``WWF Smackdown!'' You'll definitely see more than
two huge trucks barreling down an S-shaped race course. There's
enough make-believe scandal, intrigue, rivalries, villains and
curvy babes behind-the-scenes to populate five ``General
Hospitals.'' Eight actors were hired to play everything from
fiendish truck owners to man-stealing home wreckers. And since this
is UPN, TV's most macho network, expect sizzling sex appeal.
</P>
<P>
   ``You mean girls in short skirts and tight bras?'' says Barry
Frank, the show's executive producer, with tongue firmly planted in
cheek. ``Nah, we wouldn't do anything like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Adds talent coordinator Mike Mathis: ``We were looking for
character types who could take it over-the-top and women who were
stereotypically beautiful.''
</P>
<P>
   The network says if ``Monster Trux 2000'' attracts enough
viewers, it might become _ gulp! _ a weekly series.
</P>
<P>
   Don't laugh. Monster truck racing has a loyal _ and rabid _
following. Nine to 10 million live spectators see monster trucks
shows each year. The sport's major promoters produce more than 200
events annually. Minor promoters, fairs and racetracks stage 400 to
500 events each year. And at a time when tasteless and often
downright boorish specials are watched by millions, UPN's ``Monster
Trux 2000'' is jumping into the anything goes TV game at the right
time.
</P>
<P>
   Remember, many TV insiders snickered when UPN put ``Smackdown''
on its fall schedule. But thanks to that testosterone-heavy series,
the network recently lured 600,000 more viewers than the WB. That
UPN is airing ``Monster Trux 2000'' during February sweeps
indicates how much confidence it has in the special.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of pressure,'' admits Frank. ``We put this
together in six weeks from a standing start. We have a lot riding
on it. Everybody's pretty tense and pretty excited because we all
know what's at stake.''
</P>
<P>
   That's quite obvious on this cool evening. It's two hours before
show time and the scene at Mesa Park, a dusty, 100-acre outdoor
facility, can only be described as hectic. Drivers are milling
around, checking their rigs one last time. Several TV production
staffers are scurrying about. A giant fire-breathing dinosaur
repeatedly crushes the same car in the middle of the race track.
There are the inevitable last-minute script changes, and the actors
sit nervously while munching on fish and potatoes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not quite like doing `Gone With The Wind','' cracks
Frank, while surveying the chaotic scene, ``but it sure feels like
it sometimes.''
</P>
<P>
   Compounding the madness is a throng of wide-eyed onlookers who
have arrived to meet and greet Rena Mero,
</P>
<P>
   a k a Sable, the former WWF wrestler.
</P>
<P>
   So, what does Mero know about monster trucks?
</P>
<P>
   ``They're big, they're loud and they can run things over,'' the
shapely Florida native says after signing autographs. ``I used to
have a four wheel drive truck, but I like small sports cars.''
</P>
<P>
   While the former Playboy cover girl is here to lure people to
UPN's special, she seems more interested in talking about her
upcoming projects. In a brief two-minute interview, the public
relations savvy Mero amazingly plugged her Web site (renamero.com),
book (she's writing it now), and upcoming syndicated TV series
co-starring NBA bad boy Dennis Rodman (``The Consultants,'' in
which she plays a Las Vegas undercover police officer).
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year was a difficult period,'' says Mero, who filed a
$100 million lawsuit against the WWF (it was later settled out of
court). ``But I've put the past behind me. Working with the WWF was
a wonderful experience and it opened up a lot of doors for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Mero may not know a monster truck from a Tonka toy, but
``Monster Trux 2000'' host Goodwin certainly does. She bought a
white Dodge Ram over a year ago and has always been intrigued with
oversized trucks. The producers often tell Goodwin, who's been
featured on ``Days of Our Lives,'' ``Baywatch'' and in numerous
fitness magazines, to tone down her excitement.
</P>
<P>
   ``She certainly knows all the lingo and the drivers,'' says
Frank.
</P>
<P>
   ``What fascinates me about trucks is the power, and, ooooooh,
the noise,'' Goodwin coos.
</P>
<P>
   But is Goodwin talking about a monster truck, or a lantern-jawed
hunk?
</P>
<P>
   ``I bought my truck when I left my fiance, so let's just say the
truck is there for me like no man has been,'' she says, laughing.
``If it breaks down, I just get it fixed. It doesn't talk back.
Sometimes a truck is better than a man.''
</P>
<P>
   Nothing, however, is better than Scorpion's accident. Word
spreads, however, that the accident may have been staged. Producers
say no. So does Patterson.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just going for it,'' swears the 37-year-old driver.
``It's the nature of the beast. It wasn't part of the show. If it
was, I should get a big raise.''
</P>
<P>
   Adds Goodwin: ``That's why this stuff is so great, you never
know what's going to happen. We're making this up as we go along.''
</P>
<P>
   But will viewers care?
</P>
<P>
   ``We know people love racing and we know people love conflict,''
says Camilla Noble, who plays Dusty, a naive race car driver
girlfriend. ``Now they get both of them.''

KOREAN PROTESTERS USE THE INTERNET TO SEEK REFORM 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By HOWARD W. FRENCH   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEOUL, South Korea _ With his one-day beard and tousled hair,
Park Byung-ok retains a hint of the look of the student protesters
who lobbed rocks and Molotov cocktails at the police, who responded
with tear gas and rubber bullets, in the often turbulent 1980s
here.
</P>
<P>
   But these days, Park, 39, and his associates are launching
nothing more lethal than e-mail messages _ many thousands _ to
officials and political parties from civic groups that are
sprouting around the country. The effects are rocking this country
in ways never imagined by the radical opposition that many of the
protesters belonged to a generation ago.
</P>
<P>
   In the recent Asian economic crisis, ``Koreans endured
tremendous hardships, while politicians fattened themselves and
spent their time bickering,'' said Park, director of the Citizens'
Coalition for Economic Justice, one of the groups that are
reshaping politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``Koreans have realized that politicians will not bring about
reforms of their own accord,'' he said. ``Civic groups like ours
are creating an avenue for people to vent their frustrations and
demand change.''
</P>
<P>
   South Korea led the region in its response to the crisis, as the
government of President Kim Dae-jung moved vigorously to break up
the hidebound conglomerates. In the last few months, as if by
reformist contagion, civic groups like Park's have been forcing
major changes on a long-static political class.
</P>
<P>
   This country has long known periods of sudden, intense civil
activism, usually in the form of radical student politics or
hard-line nationalism. What sets the current movement apart is that
it is mostly led by middle-class people with moderate politics,
linked together by the Internet in ways that would have been
impossible two or three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Coming together online in January under the banner of Citizens'
Solidarity, more than 500 civic groups and nongovernmental
organizations have shaken the established parties. One result was a
revision of the electoral code this month.
</P>
<P>
   The groups are now demanding the elimination of reportedly
corrupt politicians from their slates in a nationwide legislative
election in April. To enforce their demands, the groups have sought
to shame the three main parties by publishing a list of politicians
who they say are unworthy of office.
</P>
<P>
   On the Internet, the critics are publishing reports on what they
say are the politicians' shady dealings, poor attendance records in
the legislature or votes for unpopular bills.
</P>
<P>
   The normally cautious newspapers and television stations have
rushed to try to match the civic groups' information, or at least
report it, so as not to appear irrelevant. In a country where
political demonstrations remain tightly restricted, the new groups
have invented what they call Internet rallies, in which new members
sign up, opinions are exchanged, letter-writing campaigns are
organized and policies are debated and published.
</P>
<P>
   At rallies, Park said, his group's Internet home page, which
averages 50,000 hits a day, has sometimes been so deluged that it
has been briefly knocked out of service.
</P>
<P>
   That has been made possible, of course, by the explosive growth
of computer ownership and Web use in South Korea, where more than a
quarter of the population regularly use the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Simply put, our goal is political reform,'' said Jang Won, 44,
a professor of environmental studies whose group is a major player
in the civic coalition. ``We want to drive out corrupt politicians.
We want to force the parties to adopt transparent processes for
selecting candidates, and we want to break the pattern of politics
run by charismatic leaders who play on regional differences.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Although political analysts describe such reforms as a very tall
order in a country like South Korea, where the dominant political
leaders, including the president, have been fixtures since the
1960s, and where regionalism runs deep, they are not writing off
the possibility of real change.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 1987, the year of our democratization, we saw a huge amount
of civic activity,'' said Hoon Jaung, a professor of political
science at Chung Ang University here, referring to the first direct
presidential election.
</P>
<P>
   ``But in the 13 years since, things have been quiescent. But in
this period, the parties have failed to build institutions that are
responsive to the needs of the people.''
</P>
<P>
   Still fresh from their early victories, the civic groups are
already setting bigger goals.
</P>
<P>
   In the computer-filled office of his group, People's Solidarity
for Participatory Democracy, Kim Hyung-Wan, 40, a former
legislative assistant who fairly brims with reformist ambitions,
said, ``The disqualification of political candidate and driving out
corruption are just our immediate objectives.''
</P>
<P>
   His group generates $50,000 a month in contributions and has a
staff of 50. ``Our main objective,'' Kim added, ``is really to
democratize Korean society by getting people involved in social
causes.''

 &HT;    AOL aims to provide service via wireless phones, pagers
 &HT;    By Michael E. Kanell
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ America Online announced a series of deals Monday
aimed at making the service available across the country to users
of wireless phones and pagers.
</P>
<P>
   Through the arrangements, including a pact with BellSouth, AOL
hopes to gives subscribers a way to read e-mail, exchange instant
messages, check stock prices, get driving directions or check movie
listings _ the kind of features available via the Internet from
desktop computers using AOL and other online services. No financial
arrangements were disclosed.
</P>
<P>
   As part of its ``AOL Anywhere'' strategy, the Virginia-based
company made several sweeping moves to extend its service, which,
with 22 million subscribers, is already by far the largest Internet
membership. AOL has joined with paging services, a national phone
company and several of the companies that make the wireless devices
used by those services.
</P>
<P>
   With BellSouth, AOL has forged a deal to let subscribers get
instant messages and e-mail via the company's national wireless
data network.
</P>
<P>
   BellSouth believes the deal will give a dramatic boost to its
wireless service, which has mostly appealed thus far to mobile
professionals. ``It puts us, for the very first time, in the
consumer marketplace,'' said Janet Boudris, senior vice president
for BellSouth Wireless Data. ``This also will raise awareness.
Frankly, our biggest challenge has been that people don't know
about the service.''
</P>
<P>
   AOL has a similar deal with another national paging company,
Arch Communications. AOL declined to say when users would be able
to get the service via pager or what it would cost. AOL also
announced a deal with Sprint to deliver a version of AOL content
via at least some wireless phones by autumn. The company also
joined with manufacturers Nokia, Motorola and Research In Motion,
the company that makes the interactive pagers used by BellSouth.
</P>
<P>
   For AOL, which recently announced plans to buy Time Warner,
Monday's announcements laid further claim to the future of
communications since technology has clearly been rushing in the
direction of wireless. In Europe, especially, wireless users have
been on the Net for months.
</P>
<P>
   Dennis Patrick, newly named president of AOL wireless, cited
projections of 1.3 billion wireless users by 2005. Moreover, that
research predicts that within three years, one-third of Internet
users will be reaching the Net via a wireless device, he said. AOL
members send more than 110 million e-mails and 1 billion instant
messages every day. AOL also says that 70 percent of its member
households own a wireless phone, pager or both.
</P>
<P>
   But AOL is by no means the only one to notice the trend.
EarthLink _ the nation's second-largest Internet provider _ also
announced a deal Monday to put its Internet service on phones from
Sprint. The arrangement extends the relationship of Atlanta-based
EarthLink to Sprint, its largest shareholder. ``With Sprint PCS, we
will be able to extend the EarthLink Internet experience to the
wireless world by providing a mobile version of the content and
services that we deliver daily to our members on their home or
office PCs,'' said Garry Betty, EarthLink chief executive officer.

   &UR; The earth's habit of forever remaking itself in paroxysms of
fire and violence is sometimes hard on its inhabitants, a lesson
borne out again last week when villagers in Legaspi, Philippines,
fled eruptions of the deadly volcano Mayon. In a new book,
``Vulcan's Fury: Man Against the Volcano'' (Yale University Press),
Alwyn Scarth uses witnesses' accounts to tell of 15 great eruptions
and of the people who lived through them. Here is a sampling. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Vesuvius, A.D. 79
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Vesuvius, looming 4,200 feet over the Bay of Naples, has
erupted at least 200 times in the last two millenniums, most
famously and lethally in A.D. 79 when it smothered Pompeii and
other villages in ash. Among the casualties was the Roman scholar
Pliny the Elder, whose nephew, Pliny the Younger, provided an
eyewitness account of the catastrophe: &LR;
</P>
<P>
   On 24 August, about one in the afternoon, my mother pointed out
a cloud with an odd size and appearance that had just formed ....
From that distance, it was not even clear from which mountain the
cloud was rising _ although it was found afterward to be Vesuvius.
The cloud could best be described as more of an umbrella pine than
any other tree, because it rose high up in a kind of trunk and then
divided into branches .... Sometimes it looked light-colored,
sometimes it looked mottled and dirty with the earth and ash it had
carried up. Like a true scholar, my uncle saw at once that it
deserved closer study ...
</P>
<P>
   &UR; The next day: &LR;  The carriages we had ordered began to lurch to
and fro, although the ground was flat, and we could not keep them
still, even when we wedged their wheels with stones. Then we saw
the sea sucked back, apparently by an earthquake, and many
creatures were left stranded on the sand ....
</P>
<P>
   From the other direction, over the land, a dreadful black cloud
was torn by gushing, twisting, flames and great tongues of fire
like much-magnified lightning .... The cloud sank down soon
afterward and covered the sea, hiding Capri and Cape Misenum from
sight. ... Ash was already falling by now, but not very thickly.
Then I turned round and saw the thick black cloud advancing over
the land behind us like a flood. ``Let us leave the road whilst we
can still see,'' I said, ``or we will be knocked down and trampled
by the crowd.'' But it was not the darkness of a moonless, or
cloudy night, but just as if all the lamps had been put out in a
completely closed room ....
</P>
<P>
   We could hear women shrieking, children crying, and men
shouting. Some were calling for their parents, for their children,
or for their wives, and trying to recognize them by their voices
.... Some people prayed for death because they were so frightened
of dying. Many begged for the help of the gods, but even more
imagined that there were no gods left and that the last eternal
night had fallen on the world.
</P>
<P>
   Laki, 1783
</P>
<P>
   &UR; On June 8, 1783, fissures split open on the flanks of a
mountain ridge known as Laki near the southern coast of Iceland.
Over the next eight months, more than three cubic miles of lava
poured from the fissures and a sulfurous blue haze spread over the
countryside. A farmer, Jon Steingrimmson, wrote this report. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   The hairy sand-fall and sulfurous rain caused such
unwholesomeness in the air and in the earth that the grass became
yellow and pink and withered down to the roots. The animals that
wandered around the fields got yellow-colored feet with open
wounds, and yellow dots were seen on the skin of the newly shorn
sheep, which had died.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; By the end of July, according to The Leeds Intelligencer in
England, the haze had spread over Europe: &LR;
</P>
<P>
   The foreign papers mention that the haziness, which has lately
prevailed here, is general throughout all the southern part of
Europe. It is even observed upon the most lofty of Alps. In Italy,
it has occasioned great consternation, as the same appearance of
the air was remarked in Calabria and Sicily a little previous to
those dreadful earthquakes that had destroyed so many cities. The
people of France, too, began to forebode some dire calamity. The
Paris Gazette mentions that the churches are most unusually
crowded, and the shrines of their saints uncommonly frequented.
</P>
<P>
   Krakatau, 1883
</P>
<P>
   &UR; The Aug. 26, 1883, the explosion of Krakatau, in the Soenda
Straits between Sumatra and Java, was heard as far away as
Australia. It disgorged some five cubic miles of ash and dust. Most
of the Krakatau's 36,000 victims died by drowning in tsunamis. This
rice farmer, five miles inland on Java, barely survived. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   All of a sudden there came a great noise. We ... saw a great
black thing, a long way off, coming toward us. It was very high and
very strong, and we soon saw that it was water. Trees and houses
were washed away .... Not far off was some steep sloping ground. We
all ran toward it and tried to climb up out of the way of the
water. ((The wave)) was too quick for most of them, and many were
drowned almost at my side .... There was a general rush to climb up
in one particular place. This caused a great block, and many of
them got wedged together and could not move. Then they struggled
and fought, screaming and crying out all the time. Those below
tried to make those above them move on again by biting their heels.
... Some ... dragged others down with them. They would not let go
their hold, nor could those above them release themselves from this
death grip.
</P>
<P>
   Montagne Pelee, 1902
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Montagne Pelee, or ``Fire Mountain,'' on the Caribbean island
of Martinique, &LR;   &UR; had been thought to be harmless until a series of
earthquakes and explosions in the spring of 1902 transformed its
4,000-foot summit into a hellish landscape of fissures, cinder
cones and a lake of boiling water. On May 5, an earthquake breached
the lip of the new lake, releasing a wall of mud down the Blanche
River valley. Near the mouth of the river, Auguste Guerin was about
to board his yacht with his family when he turned back toward his
house for a moment: &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Then I heard a noise I can't compare with anything else _ an
immense noise _ like the devil on earth! A black avalanche, beneath
white smoke, an enormous mass, full of huge blocks, more than 10
meters high and at least 150 meters wide, was coming down the
mountain with a great din. It ... rolled up against the factory
like an army of giant rams. I was rooted on the spot.
</P>
<P>
   My unfortunate son and wife ran away from it toward the shore
.... All at once, the mud arrived. It passed 10 meters in front of
me. I felt its deathly breath. There was a great crashing sound.
Everything was crushed, drowned and submerged. My son, his wife,
and 30 ... people and huge buildings were all swept away .... Three
of those black waves came down ... making a noise like thunder, and
made the sea retreat. Under the impact of the third wave, a boat
moored in the factory harbor was thrown ... over a factory wall,
killing one of my foremen, who was standing next to me. I went down
to the shore. The desolation was indescribable. Where a prosperous
factory _ the work of a lifetime _ had stood a moment before, there
was now nothing left but an expanse of mud forming a black shroud
for my son, his wife and my workmen.

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Question: The company wants to relocate me to
another city, and I think it would be an outstanding opportunity. I
know this will cost the company a good deal of money, and I wonder
if I would be out of line by asking for the company's help on some
of the family matters that accompany this move, such as helping my
wife get a job. M.G.
</P>
<P>
   Answer: You are about to have a very moving experience, and many
companies today are taking a broad range of steps to make this type
of move easier for the employees and their families. The cost of
relocating an employee is often in the $40,000 range and up, and
most companies are not about to cut corners when it comes to making
a relocation work.
</P>
<P>
   You would not be out of line if you were to approach management
to discuss the personal side of the move. If the key issue is for
the company to help your wife find a job, there are many ways that
companies can do this, and there is no reason for a company to be
less than receptive to your request in this area.
</P>
<P>
   You and your wife probably have other family-related concerns
about this move, and the two of you should discuss them with each
other. If you find that there are some key areas in which you need
additional company help and support in this move, you should
discuss them with management.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that you have been offered this relocation indicates
that management most likely has a great deal of faith and
confidence in you. If you have some reasonable requests, you will
probably receive some reasonable answers. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q: I have interviewed several people for an important position
here, but I have not found a good match. I was not satisfied with
the last applicant, but after my manager looked at his resume, he
told me that I should seriously consider hiring him. I think that
would be a mistake, But I don't want to cross my manager. What do
you think? C.F.
</P>
<P>
   A: All you were asked to do is to seriously consider hiring this
applicant, and you are not crossing your manager if you do just
that: seriously consider hiring this person. If you still find that
he is not right for the job, move on to the next.
</P>
<P>
   It is your responsibility to fill this position, and that is
what you should do. If your manager is actually ordering you to
hire this individual, then something is out of order with his
ability to manage. And further, his decision on this applicant is
particularly flawed because it based solely on the limited data
that appear in a resume.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, perhaps his message is for you to look more
carefully at the standards, methods, and criteria that you are
applying in the screening process. Is it possible that you have
established hurdles that are so high that no applicant can clear
them? After all, many employers today are placing less emphasis on
fitting an applicant into the job, and more emphasis on building
the job around an applicant.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Our manager is very vocal when it comes to giving recognition
to my fellow employees whenever they do something well, but even if
I do the greatest job in the world, I hear nothing. It's not that
my manager is unaware of my performance, it's just that she ignores
it. What should I do? G.S. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A: A manager who ignores the performance of one employee is also
ignoring several key elements of management, including motivation,
team-building, and productivity.
</P>
<P>
   There can be any number of reasons why your manager is ignoring
you. Giving her the benefit of the doubt, perhaps she is not as
aware of your performance as you think she may be, or perhaps she
feels that you are not a person who needs as much attention as some
of your peers. At the same time her lack of recognition may be
based on a difficult prior encounter with you, or perhaps it is
based on some form of bias.
</P>
<P>
   Since you feel that you deserve more recognition from her, you
should let her know. Tell her that you are confused over the way
that recognition is provided in the department, since some of your
co-workers seem to be receiving considerable recognition for their
performance, but you are not. Be sure to mention some of your
accomplishments, and then ask her for suggestions as to what you
need to do to receive more recognition.
</P>
<P>
   Listen carefully to her suggestions and follow them. If you
still do not hear any words of praise from her, then perhaps it is
time for senior management to hear from you.

 UNDATED: my workmen.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; Three days later, the volcano exploded. Within two minutes,
some 27,000 people in the town of St. Pierre were dead. One
survivor, Louis-Auguste Sylbaris, was in solitary confinement in
jail. He later had a career with the Barnum &AMP; Bailey circus as the
only survivor of the ``Silent City of Death.'' &LR;
</P>
<P>
   They hadn't yet brought my daily rations, when, all of a sudden,
there was a terrifying noise. Everybody was screaming ``Help! Help!
I'm burning! I'm dying!'' Five minutes later, nobody was crying out
anymore _ except me. Then a cloud of smoke gushed through the
opening .... It burnt me so much that I was dancing up and down,
left and right _ everywhere _ to get out of its way .... I listened
and shouted for help, but nobody answered.
</P>
<P>
   Paricutin, 1943
</P>
<P>
   &UR; In early 1943 scientists got a rare chance to observe the birth
of a volcano in Mexico, when earthquakes began rumbling the town of
Paricutin, about 200 miles west of Mexico City, with such
increasing frequency that local inhabitants were afraid to sleep.
On Feb. 20 a farmer, Dionisio Pulido, noticed a new hole in his
cornfield. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   I noticed that a little hole ... on one of the knolls on my land
had opened, and I noticed that this fissure, as I followed it up
with my eye, was long and passed from where I stood, through the
hole, and stretched back ((westward)) to Cerro de Canicjuata ....
`Here is something strange,' I thought ... and I searched the
ground for marks to see if it had opened during the night or not,
but I couldn't find any.
</P>
<P>
   I heard some thunder, the trees trembled, and ... then I saw how
the ground swelled up 2 meters or 2.5 meters in the hole, and a
kind of smoke, or fire dust _ gray like ashes _ began to rise from
a part of the crack I had not seen before. Immediately, more smoke
began to rise up with a loud and continuous hiss or whistle, and
there was a smell of sulfur .... Then the ground rose in the form
of a confused cake above the open fissure, and then disappeared,
but I cannot say whether it blew out or fell back _ I believe it
swallowed itself. I was sure the earth was on fire ....
</P>
<P>
   I was very frightened, and I mounted my mare and galloped to
Paricutin, where I found my wife and son and friends waiting for
me. They were afraid that I was dead and that they would never see
me again.
</P>
<P>
   Mount St. Helens, 1980
</P>
<P>
   &UR; The whole world was watching on the morning of Sunday, May 18,
1980, when Mount St. Helens, an 8,000-foot-high snow-capped cone in
the southern part of Washington state, blew its top after two
months of preliminary rumblings and eruptions, leaving a hole two
miles long, a mile across and 2,000 feet deep, and 57 people dead.
Among those watching on a nearby ridge was a geologist, David
Johnston, who just had time to radio his base ``Vancouver!
Vancouver! This is it!'' before the wall of burning gas and rock
hit and killed him. Circling above the mountain in a chartered
plane were the geologists Keith and Dorothy Stoffel. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   The nature of the movement was eerie .... The entire mass began
to ripple and churn up .... Then the entire north side of the
summit began sliding north ... we were watching this landslide of
unbelievable proportions slide down ... the mountain toward Spirit
Lake .... Before we could snap off more than a few pictures, a huge
explosion blasted out .... We neither felt nor heard a thing even
though we were ((flying)) just east of the summit at the time ...
the initial realization of the enormous size of the eruption hit
us, and we focused our attention on getting out of there.

FOR OSCAR NOMINEE RICHARD FARNSWORTH, GRASS IS ALREADY GREENER
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
 
By GLENN WHIPP 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Richard Farnsworth's agent called him two years ago to tell
him that David Lynch had offered him the lead role in a new movie
called ``The Straight Story,'' the 79-year-old actor had a question
and a concern. The question: Who's David Lynch? The concern: He
wouldn't be physically able to play the part.
</P>
<P>
   Farnsworth was hurting. He needed hip replacement surgery, the
byproduct of a celebrated career as a stunt man that spanned more
than 40 years and 300 movies. ``I've had a hard life,'' Farnsworth
told his agent. ``I don't think I can do this. I'm not getting
around too good.''
</P>
<P>
   He softened his stance when he learned that Lynch had directed
one of his favorite movies (``The Elephant Man''). Then he read
``The Straight Story'' script and discovered that the man he'd be
playing, Alvin Straight, had !ital!two bad hips and needed two
canes just to get around.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I saw that, I figured I was kind of meant to play
Alvin,'' Farnsworth says. ``And I'm sure glad I did. I might never
get to do another movie this good. It's like a little miracle.''
</P>
<P>
   For his moving portrayal of Straight, a frail old man who in
1994 hitched a makeshift trailer to a riding lawnmower and drove
from Iowa to Wisconsin to see his estranged brother, Farnsworth
recently became the oldest man ever to receive a best actor Oscar
nomination. Farnsworth woke up early and watched the nominations
announcement, letting out a ``war whoop'' when his name was called.
``It feels pretty good,'' Farnsworth says. ``I have to tell you, I
was sweating it out.''
</P>
<P>
   For the gentle, sweet-natured Farnsworth, playing Straight marks
the third ``role of a lifetime'' in his most unusual career. The
Los Angeles native had made movies all his life as a stunt man, but
never had a substantial speaking role until Alan Pakula cast him as
a crusty old ranch hand opposite Jane Fonda in the 1978 film
``Comes a Horseman.''
</P>
<P>
   Farnsworth, who up until then believed he was a horrible actor,
received an Oscar nomination for his work.
</P>
<P>
   Five years later, Farnsworth again dazzled critics in his first
starring role, playing a gentlemanly stagecoach robber in ``The
Grey Fox.'' Farnsworth even had some love scenes in the film, which
he says ``shows there's a little life and romance in the elderly.''
</P>
<P>
   But good roles were few and far between, and Farnsworth turned
down a lot of work because he doesn't care for movies filled with
``sex, violence and four-letter words.'' (He says he's still
embarrassed that he made ``The Getaway,'' the profanity-filled 1994
remake of the Steve McQueen film.) When Lynch came calling for
``The Straight Story,'' Farnsworth considered himself semi-retired,
raising a few longhorn cattle and some horses at his ranch in
Lincoln, N.M.
</P>
<P>
   ``Richard was the only person I could see playing Alvin,'' Lynch
says. ``His soul comes through his words, his face and his eyes.
When he says something, it comes from deep within and he makes it
real as it comes out. He believes every single thing, like a great
actor should, and he is a great actor and a great human being.''
</P>
<P>
   While making the movie, the filmmakers retraced Straight's
300-mile route from Laurens, Iowa, to Mount Zion, Wis., and
Farnsworth met many people who knew Straight and remembered him
fondly. All the while, Farnsworth wondered how Straight made the
arduous journey, seeing as it tired him out to ``sit on that darned
tractor for just the two or three hours a day.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a tough old cuss with a lot of guts and stubborn as can
be,'' Farnsworth says. ``I don't think he was a saint, but most
people had some good things to say about him.''
</P>
<P>
   The same could be said for Farnsworth. Mary Sweeney, Lynch's
long-time companion who co-wrote, co-produced and edited ``The
Straight Story,'' noted the similarities between the two men. Both,
she says, have a quiet dignity and honesty about them. It was the
perfect marriage of actor and material.
</P>
<P>
   ``Richard can be sitting there, saying nothing, but you see
exactly what he's feeling and thinking,'' Sweeney says. ``And maybe
it's just beautiful to see someone who looks that way and then they
!ital!are that way. That's all it is. He is what he appears to be,
which is a really beautiful man.''
</P>
<P>
   Farnsworth flashes an embarrassed smile and casts his eyes
downward when told of Sweeney's kind words. ``That's nice,'' he
says finally. While he won't draw any comparisons himself, he does
express a deep connection to Straight's determination to do things
his way despite his age and infirmities.
</P>
<P>
   ``If anything, the older I get, the easier it is for me,''
Farnsworth says. ``I don't have anything to lose. When it comes
down to it, I don't think age means a darned thing. I know people
who are old at 60. They look older than I do; they look like
they're 90, and they act even older. Age is all in your head.''
</P>
<P>
   Farnsworth attributes his ease in front of the camera to all the
years he has spent in the movie business. Growing up in Los
Angeles, Farnsworth was forced to quit school in the ninth grade
during the Depression and take a job grooming horses and cleaning
stalls. When he was 18, he joined the Southwest rodeo circuit and
his horseman skills led to stunt work in films.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't need any stunt training,'' Farnsworth says, ``since I
had already hit the ground plenty of times.''
</P>
<P>
   His first movie was ``The Adventures of Marco Polo'' in 1937
where he was one of 500 Mongolian horsemen. He drove chariots in
``The Ten Commandments,'' herded cattle with John Wayne and
Montgomery Clift in ``Red River'' (where he taught city slicker
Clift how to roll cigarettes and crease a cowboy hat) and doubled
for Kirk Douglas for 11 months during the making of ``Spartacus.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a good movie, but I was a little self-conscious in
that gladiator get-up,'' Farnsworth says of ``Spartacus.'' ``I had
real skinny legs and knobby knees. I looked like a crane in that
short skirt.''
</P>
<P>
   Farnsworth stopped doing stunts right about the time he made his
mark in ``Comes a Horseman.'' (``The ground started getting pretty
hard,'' he says in his gentle drawl.)
</P>
<P>
   He had two children with his late wife. His son, Hill, followed
in his father's footsteps and became one of Hollywood's top stunt
men. For the past few years, Farnsworth has been dating a 40-ish
Delta flight attendant and, if she retires (which she may soon),
Farnsworth says he'll ask her to marry him.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's nice to have somebody who loves you,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Farnsworth will soon have that long-delayed hip replacement
surgery. And after he's through rehabilitating, he figures he'll be
busier than ever, although he seems more excited about riding
horses on his ranch than making another movie.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just don't like too many movies these days; it's real
disappointing to see what people consider `entertainment,''' he
says.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why I loved `The Straight Story.' There wasn't a
four-letter word in it. Maybe it will help start a trend toward
more family films.''
</P>
<P>
   If it does, you can be sure Farnsworth will be back in the
saddle again, looking for another ``once-in-a-lifetime'' role to
add to his singular, remarkable career. &QL;

BUY YOUR OWN CHUNK OF MONOPOLY PROPERTY

c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   As any Monopoly fan knows, when it comes to buying property,
it's location, location, location.
</P>
<P>
   A newsstand on St. Charles Place, for instance, is going to be
cheaper than a hotel on Park Place, so when the folks at Monopoly
created a collection of miniature businesses based on the
65-year-old board game, they used that old real estate rule.
</P>
<P>
   The limited-edition collection by Department 56 is called
Monopoly Citylights and features small resin buildings reminiscent
of 1930s architecture. The front entrances resemble deed cards and
feature tiny pewter game tokens by the doorway. And when the eight
buildings are lined up, letter discs on the facades light up and
spell out the game title, Monopoly.
</P>
<P>
   According to spokeswoman Rebecca Herbst, a Bank and Trust
building, featuring marbleized pillars built in the pastel colors
of Monopoly money, is offered as a gift when you buy the entire
collection.
</P>
<P>
   Getting back to real estate values, the newsstand is $37.50 and
the hotel is $60, and all are available at specialty shops,
including Sparky's in Universal City, Calif., and Allied Model
Trains in Culver City, Calif. For more information, call (800)
624-9027. &QL;

   MCCAIN-RIGHT (Virginia Beach, Va.) _ Taking his presidential
campaign to a stronghold of Christian conservatism, Arizona Sen.
John McCain delivered a harsh attack Monday on the ``self-appointed

Christian right's best-known leaders, Pat Robertson and the
Reverend Jerry Falwell. By David Barstow.

   REPUBS-DIVIDE-ASSESS (Washington) _ News Analysis: Gov. George
W. Bush and Sen. John McCain are now running for two separate
Republican parties. As the bitter contest between them hurtles
toward a new set of primaries, it is deepening long-standing fault
lines in the Republican coalition and turning the race into a
fierce debate over what the Republican party of the future should
look like. By Alison Mitchell. (1600 words)

   TERROR-U.S. (Washington) _ More terrorism plots are linked to
Osama bin Laden. By James Risen.
</P>
<P>
   INDIA-TECH-WORKERS (Bombay) _ A growing though still modest
number of India's biggest American success stories, high-tech
workers whose lives are now firmly rooted in the United States, are
beginning to come home to India, and not just to visit relatives,
but also to start companies, invest their capital and indulge their
philanthropic instincts. By Celia W. Dugger.
</P>
<P>
   TAX-SHELTERS (Washington) _ Calling the rapid growth of abusive
corporate tax shelters ``the most serious compliance issue

   NY-DIALLO-PROSECUTOR (New York) _ The Bronx district attorney
vigorously defended on Monday his office's handling of the Amadou
Diallo case, attributing the acquittals of four police officers in

Responding to assertions from jurors that his office presented a
weak case, Robert T. Johnson said that he would not do anything
different were he to try the case again. By Amy Waldman.

<P>
   NY-INFANT-MORTALITY (New York) _ In central Brooklyn _ where
storefronts are boarded, housing projects stand in defiant
opposition to the boom times, and the hospitals are more or less
broke _ too many babies are dying. They die at rates that the city
as a whole has not seen in nearly two decades. And they die, in
some cases, at a rate double what the federal government has set as
the infant mortality goal for the nation. By Jennifer Steinhauer.

   Over the years, skeptics have tried to cast doubt on the idea of
global warming by noting that measurements taken by earth
satellites since 1979 have found little or no temperature rise in
large parts of the upper atmosphere. The satellites'
all-encompassing coverage yields more reliable results than
temperature samplings showing a century-long warming trend at the
earth's surface, they argued.
</P>
<P>
   In January, a special study by the National Research Council,
the research arm of the National Academy of Sciences, declared that
the ``apparent disparity'' between the two sets of measurements
over the 20-year history of the satellite measurements ``in no way
invalidates the conclusion that surface temperature has been
rising.'' The surface warming ``is undoubtedly real,'' the study
panel said.
</P>
<P>
   But the dissenters are a long way from conceding the debate, and
they have seized on other aspects of the panel's report in an
effort to bolster their case.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, according to interviews with some prominent
skeptics, there is now wide agreement among them that the average
surface temperature of the earth has indeed risen.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we're arguing over whether there's any global
warming,'' said Dr. William M. Gray, an atmospheric scientist at
Colorado State University, known for his annual predictions of
Atlantic hurricane activities as well as his staunch, longtime
dissent on global climate change. ``The question is, `What is the
cause of it?'''
</P>
<P>
   On that issue, and on the remaining big question of how the
climate might change in the future, skeptics continue to differ
sharply with the dominant view among climate experts.
</P>
<P>
   The dominant view is that the surface warming is at least partly
attributable to emissions of heat-trapping waste industrial gases
like carbon dioxide, a product of the burning of fossil fuels like
coal, oil and natural gas. A U.N. scientific panel has predicted
that unless these greenhouse gas emissions are reduced, the earth's
average surface temperature will rise by some 2 to 6 degrees
Fahrenheit over the next century, with a best estimate of about 3.5
degrees, compared with a rise of 5 to 9 degrees since the depths of
the last ice age 18,000 to 20,000 years ago. This warming, the
panel said, would touch off widespread disruptions in climate and
weather and cause the global sea level to rise and flood many
places.
</P>
<P>
   Gray and others challenge all of this. To them, the observed
surface warming of about 1 degree over the last century _ with an
especially sharp rise in the last quarter century _ is mostly or
wholly natural, and there is no significant human influence on
global climate. They also adhere firmly to their long-held opinion
that any future warming will be inconsequential or modest at most,
and that its effects will largely be beneficial.
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, though, adversaries in the debate are not so far
apart. For instance, some dissenters say that future warming caused
by greenhouse gases will be near the low end of the range predicted
by the U.N. scientific panel. And most adherents of the dominant
view readily acknowledge that the size of the human contribution to
global warming is not yet known.
</P>
<P>
   The thrust-and-parry of the climate debate goes on nevertheless.
</P>
<P>
   With the National Research Council panel's conclusion that the
surface warming is real, ``one of the key arguments of the
contrarians has evaporated,'' said Dr. Michael Oppenheimer, an
atmospheric scientist with Environmental Defense, formerly the
Environmental Defense Fund.
</P>
<P>
   But those on the other side of the argument see things
differently.
</P>
<P>
   To them, the most important finding of the panel is its
validation of satellite readings showing less warming, and maybe
none, in parts of the upper atmosphere, said Dr. S. Fred Singer, an
independent atmospheric scientist who is an outspoken dissenter.
</P>
<P>
   For him and other climate dissenters, this disparity is key, in
that it does not show up in computer models scientists use to
predict future trends. The fact that these models apparently missed
the difference in warming between the surface and the upper air,
the skeptics say, casts doubt on their reliability overall.
</P>
<P>
   Experts on all sides of the debate acknowledge that the climate
models are imperfect, and even proponents of their use say their
results should be interpreted cautiously.
</P>
<P>
   A further problem is raised by the divergent temperatures at the
surface and in the upper air, said Dr. Richard S. Lindzen, an
atmospheric scientist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
who is a foremost skeptic. ``Both are right,'' he said, but
increasing levels of greenhouse gases should warm the entire
troposphere (the lower 6 to 10 miles of the atmosphere). That they
have not, he said, suggests that ``what's happening at the surface
is not related to the greenhouse effect.''
</P>
<P>
   Skeptics also argue that the lower temperatures measured by the
satellites are confirmed by instruments borne aloft by weather
balloons. But over a longer period, going back 40 years, there is
no discrepancy between surface readings and those obtained by the
balloons, said Dr. John Michael Wallace, an atmospheric scientist
at the University of Washington in Seattle, who was chairman of the
research council study panel.
</P>
<P>
   Although the climate debate has usually been portrayed as a
polarized argument between believers and contrarians, there is
actually a broad spectrum of views among scientists. And while the
views of skeptics display some common themes, there are many
degrees of dissent, many permutations and combinations of
individual opinion. The views of some have changed materially over
the years, while others have expressed essentially the same basic
opinions all along.
</P>
<P>
   One whose views have evolved is Wallace, who describes himself
as ``more skeptical than most people'' but ``fairly open to
arguments on both sides'' of the debate. He says the especially
sharp surface warming trend of the 1990s has ``pulled me in a
mainstream direction.'' While he once believed the warming observed
in recent decades was just natural variation in climate, he said,
he is now perhaps 80 percent sure that it has been induced by human
activity _ ``but that's still a long way from being willing to
stake my reputation on it.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   A decade ago, Wallace said, many skeptics questioned whether
there even was a surface warming trend, in part because what now
appears to be a century-long trend had been interrupted in the
1950s, 1960s and early 1970s, and it had not yet resumed all that
markedly. But the surge in the 1980s and 1990s changed the picture
substantially.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Wallace said, few appear to doubt that the earth's
surface has warmed. One prominent dissenter on the greenhouse
question, Dr. Robert Balling, a climatologist at Arizona State
University, says, ``the surface temperatures appear to be rising,
no doubt,'' and other skeptics agree.
</P>
<P>
   There also appears to be general agreement that atmospheric
concentrations of greenhouse gases are rising. At 360 parts per
million, up from 315 parts in the late 1950s, the concentration of
carbon dioxide is nearly 30 percent higher than before the
Industrial Revolution, and the highest in the last 420,000 years.
</P>
<P>
   Mainstream scientists, citing recent studies, suggest that the
relatively rapid warming of the last 25 years cannot be explained
without the greenhouse effect. Over that period, according federal
scientists, the average surface temperature rose at a rate
equivalent to about 3.5 degrees per century _ substantially more
than the rise for the last century as a whole, and about what is
predicted by computer models for the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
   But many skeptics, including Gray and Singer, maintain that the
warming of the past 25 years can be explained by natural causes,
most likely changes in the circulation of heat-bearing ocean
waters. In fact, Gray says he expects that over the next few
decades, the warming will end and there will be a resumption of the
cooling of the 1950s and 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   At bottom, people on all sides of the debate agree, the question
of the warming's cause has not yet been definitively answered. In
December, a group of 11 experts on the question looked at the
status of the continuing quest to detect the greenhouse signal amid
the ``noise'' of the climate's natural variability.
</P>
<P>
   The lead author of the study was Dr. Tim P. Barnett, a
climatologist at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography in La
Jolla, Calif. Barnett, who has long worked on detecting the
greenhouse signal, describes himself as a ``hard-nosed'' skeptic on
that particular issue, even though he believes that global warming
in the long run will be a serious problem.
</P>
<P>
   The study by Barnett and others, published in The Bulletin of
the American Meteorological Society, concluded that the ``most
probable cause'' of the observed warming had been a combination of
natural and human-made factors. But they said scientists had not
yet been able to separate the greenhouse signal from the natural
climate fluctuations. This state of affairs, they wrote, ``is not
satisfactory.''
</P>
<P>
   Two big questions complicate efforts to predict the course of
the earth's climate over the next century: How sensitive is the
climate system, inherently, to the warming effect of greenhouse
gases? And how much will atmospheric levels of the gases rise over
coming decades?
</P>
<P>
   The mainstream view, based on computerized simulations of the
climate system, is that a doubling of greenhouse gas concentrations
would produce a warming of about 3 to 8 degrees. But Lindzen and
Gray, pointing to what they consider the models' problems with the
physics of the atmosphere, say they overestimate possible warming.
It ``will be extremely little,'' Gray said. How little? Lindzen
pegs it at about half a degree to a bit less than 2 degrees, if
atmospheric carbon dioxide doubles.
</P>
<P>
   Other factors in the climate system modify the response to
heat-trapping gases, and the U.N. panel's analysis included these
to arrive at its projection of a 2- to 6-degree rise in the average
global surface temperature by 2100. One factor is various possible
levels of future carbon dioxide emissions. Singer, saying that
improving energy efficiency will have a big impact on emissions,
predicts a warming of less than 1 degree by 2100.
</P>
<P>
   Balling projects a warming just shy of 1 degree for the next 50
years, not out of line with the U.N. panel's lower boundary.
Another skeptic, Dr. Patrick J. Michaels, a climatologist at the
University of Virginia, similarly forecasts a greenhouse warming
rise of 2.3 degrees over the next century. As is now the case, he
says, the warming would be most pronounced in the winter, at night,
and in sub-Arctic regions like Siberia and Alaska. A warming of
that magnitude, he and others insist, could not be very harmful,
and would in fact confer benefits like longer growing seasons and
faster plant growth.
</P>
<P>
   ``It should be pretty clear,'' he said, that the warming so far
``didn't demonstrably dent health and welfare very much,'' and he
said he saw no reason ``to expect a sudden turnaround in the same
over the next 50 years.'' After that, he said, it is impossible to
predict the shape of the world's energy system and, therefore,
greenhouse gas emissions.
</P>
<P>
   A warming in the low end of the range predicted by the U.N.
panel may well materialize, said Oppenheimer, the environmentalist.
But, he said, the high end may also materialize, in which case,
mainstream scientists say, there would be serious, even
catastrophic, consequences for human society. ``There is no
compelling evidence to allow us to choose between the low end, or
the high end, or the middle,'' Oppenheimer said.
</P>
<P>
   If business continues as usual, the world is likely at some
point to find out who is right.

DAIMLERCHRYSLER REPORTS 16 PERCENT RISE IN PROFIT 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By MICHELLE KREBS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ DaimlerChrysler AG said Monday that its profit for
1999 increased 16 percent, in line with analysts' expectations, as
it benefited from cost cuts, stronger vehicle sales and a rich mix
of high-profit models.
</P>
<P>
   DaimlerChrysler, which posted its results in euros and dollars,
said its adjusted net income for 1999, its first full year of
operation, increased 16 percent, to 6.2 billion euros, or $6.3
billion, compared with $5.4 billion in 1998. That translated to
6.21 euros, or $6.25, a share, compared with $5.62 a share in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Adjusted operating profit increased 20 percent, to 10.32 billion
euros, or $10.4 billion. Revenue rose 14 percent, to $151 billion.
Results reflect one-time effects of the sale of its stake in
Debitel communication services and the reorganization of its
Adtranz rail unit.
</P>
<P>
   For the fourth quarter, DaimlerChrysler's adjusted net profit
increased 32 percent, to $1.6 billion, or $1.60 a share. Its
adjusted operating profit rose 37 percent, to $2.7 billion. Revenue
rose 20 percent, to $41.7 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``The results were pretty much in line with what we were looking
for,'' said David M. Garrity, an auto analyst at Dresdner Kleinwort
Benson in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Investors were cheered by the results, lifting shares of
DaimlerChrysler by $2.1875, or 4.4 percent, to $65.6875 in New
York. In Frankfurt, Germany, shares rose 1.38 euros, or 2 percent,
to 67.28 euros.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference Monday at DaimlerChrysler's headquarters in
Stuttgart, Germany, company officials attributed the profit gain to
savings, improved sales and a better mix of high-profit models.
</P>
<P>
   ``The higher sales volume and mix of models were the biggest
factors,'' said Robert J. Eaton, the company's chairman.
</P>
<P>
   Worldwide sales, led by the surprisingly strong markets of
Europe and the United States, increased to almost 4.9 million cars
and trucks, up from 4.5 million in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Sales of Mercedes-Benz vehicles and the Smart city car, which
finally hit its sales target of 80,000 units a year, increased to a
record of more than 1 million vehicles worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, Mercedes-Benz became the best-selling
luxury brand for the first time in history. Chrysler Group sales,
which include the Chrysler, Dodge and Jeep brands, rose to 3.2
million vehicles in 1999, up from 3.1 million in 1998, accounting
for nearly half of DaimlerChrysler's annual revenue. Vehicle sales
were buoyed by the introduction of nine products in 1999 and strong
sales of high-profit models like Jeep sport utility vehicles and
Mercedes luxury vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   DaimlerChrysler's profits further benefited from about $1.4
billion in savings derived from combining purchasing, sales and
other functions of the former Daimler-Benz AG and Chrysler Corp.,
which merged in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``They outperformed modestly in terms of cost savings through
synergies,'' said Garrity, who predicts that DaimlerChrysler will
continue to enjoy ``a favorable blend'' of strong sales and savings
this year.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``The issue this year are the competitive conditions in North
America, especially on light-truck sales, and the model changes the
Chrysler operations face this year,'' said Garrity, who predicts a
challenging first half but a strengthening second half for the
automaker in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The results were good news for U.S. employees of the Chrysler
side of DaimlerChrysler, who will receive profit-sharing checks
averaging $8,100 this year, a record.
</P>
<P>
   The bonuses cap a lucrative year for employees of U.S. auto
companies. Ford Motor Co. will send out checks averaging $8,000 to
109,000 employees on Friday. And about 154,000 hourly employees of
General Motors Corp. will get profit-sharing checks of about $1,775
in March _ also an all-time high.
</P>
<P>
   Despite its strong 1999 performance, DaimlerChrysler will
maintain its current dividend of $2.37 a share. ``We believe it's
important to have a dividend that we can sustain,'' Eaton said at
the news conference Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of using its approximately $18 billion in cash reserves
to pay higher dividends, the automaker will ask its shareholders at
its April 19 annual meeting in Berlin to authorize the company to
buy back up to 10 percent of its shares. DaimlerChrysler's stock
has been underperforming in the United States and Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Cash reserves also will be used for other investments, including
plants, equipment, and research and development, company officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   DaimlerChrysler said it would join the bidding for Daewoo Motor
Co. Ltd. of South Korea. Other bidders include GM, Ford, Fiat of
Italy and Hyundai Motor of South Korea. Daewoo had sent letters to
the carmakers inviting bids for Daewoo and its sport utility arm,
Ssangyong Motor, early this month.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, DaimlerChrysler has been in talks with other
automobile manufacturers, including PSA Peugeot Citroen of France
and Fiat, to develop a small-car strategy that won't lose money as
its Smart car has.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've indicated that we believe with stricter European fuel
requirements in the future, we will need to expand our small car
offerings,'' Eaton said. ``We're looking at a number of ways to do
that, but we're in absolutely no rush. The stricter requirements
take effect in 2008, so we have plenty of time.''

CHECHEN HORROR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Now that the razed Chechen capital, Grozny, has been opened to
reporters and TV cameras, the outside world is becoming aware of
the horrors perpetrated in Chechnya over the past several months by
Russian forces. This awareness must be translated into action.
Strategic and regional considerations aside, the United States and
the rest of the international community can no longer ignore their
humanitarian obligation to alleviate _ and end _ the suffering of
the Chechens.
</P>
<P>
   The human rights commissioner of the Council of Europe, Alvaro
Gil-Robles, was allowed to visit Grozny Monday and was stunned by
what he witnessed. ``The destruction is really massive, it leaves a
very strong impression,'' he said. ``It's necessary to stop this
war as soon as possible. It's necessary to help this population.''
</P>
<P>
   This appeal followed closely upon a draft report by Human Rights
Watch on Russian atrocities against civilians Feb. 5 in the Grozny
suburb of Aldi. Human Rights Watch labeled as war crimes the
killing, raping, and looting and demanded that they be investigated
and punished.
</P>
<P>
   A unanimous sense-of-the-Senate resolution proposed by Paul
Wellstone, Democrat of Minnesota, called last week for an immediate
cessation of Russian military operations in Chechnya, investigation
and prosecution of atrocities, permission for an international
monitoring mission to investigate and report on war crimes in
Chechnya, and ``immediate full and unimpeded access to Chechen
civilians'' by international humanitarian agencies.
</P>
<P>
   These suggestions ought to guide the Clinton administration's
approach to the calamity created in Chechnya. Continued solicitude
for the patriotic feelings of acting President Vladimir Putin and
his entourage will only make things worse _ not only for Chechens,
but for Russians as well.
</P>
<P>
   If Putin does not negotiate a peace with Chechen leaders soon,
the conflict is certain to enter a new phase of protracted
guerrilla warfare that may lead to a proliferation of hostilities
across the northern Caucasus and eventually the unraveling of the
Russian Federation.

BRADLEY DECLARES HE IS THE `REFORM CANDIDATE PLUS'

 By JAMES DAO   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Former Sen. Bill Bradley finished his five-day stand
in Washington state on Monday, the day before its primary, with
appeals to students, women and independent voters, describing
himself as the real ``reform candidate'' who would wash corruption
out of the nation's capital.
</P>
<P>
   At an outdoor rally at the University of Washington that
attracted more than 2,000 students despite a cold drizzle, Bradley
sounded the kind of upbeat, populist tone that has marked his
recent Washington events.
</P>
<P>
   ``The rich ought to have the right to buy as many houses as they
want,'' Bradley said as he called for revamping the campaign
finance system to reduce the influence of special interest groups.
``But they should not have the right to buy our democracy.''
</P>
<P>
   As has been the case in recent days, Bradley avoided mentioning
Vice President Al Gore, his lone rival for the Democratic
presidential nomination. But he implicitly criticized the vice
president for having voted for restrictions on federal financing
for abortion.
</P>
<P>
   And he described the Democratic race as a choice between new and
old, between a party that is ``the protector of the established
interests'' and one that will fight against ``selfishness,
indifference and complacency.''
</P>
<P>
   In a news conference earlier in the day, Bradley repeatedly
sought to differentiate himself from Sen. John McCain, the
conservative Republican insurgent. McCain is drawing support from
the same kinds of disaffected Democrats and independents that
Bradley has sought, running on a similar kind of outsider message.
In Washington and some other states, voters from any party can vote
for any candidate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm the reform candidate plus,'' Bradley said at the news
conference. ``Meaning that you can have a reform candidate who is
also pro-choice, pro-gun control, invests in education and health
and is strong on the environment. All of which I think are relevant
to independent votes across their country that want reform but also
don't want the most conservative agenda in the world, which is what
you get with the Republican.''
</P>
<P>
   During a morning event outside a women's health clinic here,
Bradley touted his efforts as a senator in fighting for abortion
rights, the Equal Rights Amendment and legislation requiring
hospitals to allow new mothers to stay 48 hours after childbirth.
</P>
<P>
   He also asserted that his plan for extending private health
insurance to almost all Americans would benefit women more than
men, because, he said, women have lost health coverage at a faster
rate than men in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Women who work part time, work temporary jobs, often in order
to be with their children, rarely have any option when it comes to
their insurance,'' Bradley said. ``So many women these days are
forced to choose between their own health and the health of their
children. Women should never have to make such a choice.''
</P>
<P>
   Later in the day, Bradley flew to San Francisco, where he was to
kick off at least two days of campaigning in California. He is
expected to return to New York after a debate on Wednesday night
with Gore in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley devoted much of his time and resources to Washington, at
the expense of campaigning in larger states, on the premise that a
good showing here would give him a much-needed lift on March 7,
when 16 states will hold caucuses and primaries.

MOVIE DIRECTOR BRUCE BERESFORD TAKES A `RIGOLETTO' MEETING
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Eds: Fact box below) 
By REED JOHNSON 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The alcohol is flowing freely, and the beautiful people are
striking seductive, impersonal poses when a gust of rain blows
Bruce Beresford in off Rodeo Drive.
</P>
<P>
   Looking slightly dazed, the Australian film director quickly
scans the crowd milling about Giorgio Armani's swanky Beverly Hills
boutique, which is hosting this invitation-only reception for Los
Angeles Opera's new production of Giuseppe Verdi's ``Rigoletto.''
</P>
<P>
   The mirrored room is packed wall-to-wall with opera singers,
designers, art patrons, models, journalists and Hollywood
celebrities of varying luminescence, all sizing each other up over
cocktails. Beresford is one of the few people not wearing black.
</P>
<P>
   It's a Raymond Chandler moment, familiar to most Angelenos: Life
imitates film noir. It's also a scene that might feel right at home
in Beresford's forthcoming, pointedly updated take on Verdi's 1851
musical melodrama about egotistical power brokers and their
back-stabbing cronies and resentful minions.
</P>
<P>
   If that scenario sounds, well, vaguely L.A., you're beginning to
catch Beresford's drift. By transporting Verdi's high-voltage
tragedy from 19th-century northern Italy to 21st-century Southern
California, the Oscar-nominated director of ``Driving Miss Daisy''
and ``Tender Mercies'' is attempting to give ``Rigoletto's''
treacherous courtiers a modern-day Hollywood twist.
</P>
<P>
   In Beresford's new co-production with San Diego Opera, which
opens Wednesday at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion, the lascivious
Duke of Mantua becomes a scheming studio mogul. Rigoletto, the
hunchbacked court jester whose thirst to avenge the Duke's
deflowering of Rigoletto's daughter, Gilda, ends tragically, has
morphed into a fawning talent agent.
</P>
<P>
   The assassin Sparafucile is a stuntman, Count Monterone is a
disgraced industry executive, and various other characters have
been recast as Armani-suited hangers-on and party-hearty
glitterati.
</P>
<P>
   The production will mark the Los Angeles Opera debut of baritone
Haijing Fu, a native of the People's Republic of China, in the
title role. Tenors Frank Lopardo and Roberto Aronica will alternate
the role of the Duke, while soprano Inva Mula sings Gilda. Richard
Hickox will conduct the eight-performance run.
</P>
<P>
   Though it sounds high-concept, Beresford says he got the idea
for giving ``Rigoletto'' this hip makeover almost by coincidence a
few months ago, while shooting ``Double Jeopardy,'' a psychological
thriller starring Ashley Judd and Tommy Lee Jones.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was saying to someone at one point, not about the opera,
(that) it's amazing how there's a sort of hierarchy in Hollywood,
it's sort of medieval,'' Beresford says. ``You have a kind of baron
figure, a big star or a studio head, and they're surrounded by
acolytes, people kowtowing. They make fantastic amounts of money
and they live like kings.''
</P>
<P>
   That idea began to germinate when Los Angeles Opera general
director Peter Hemmings asked Beresford if he would consider
crafting an all-new ``Rigoletto'' this season.
</P>
<P>
   The two men had known each other from the days when Hemmings ran
the Australian Opera in Sydney, so Hemmings was well aware that
Beresford had directed four other operas, most recently a 1999
Washington Opera production of Robert Ward's ``The Crucible''
(based on Arthur Miller's play) at the Kennedy Center. Washington
Post music critic Tim Page described that staging as ``far and away
the smartest and most valuable production the company has given us
this season.''
</P>
<P>
   Knowing from first-hand experience that Hollywood loves to
contemplate itself, even when through a glass, darkly, Beresford
began conceiving a modern-dress ``Rigoletto'' treatment. While his
version will have some sharp edges, he maintains that it's not
intended as any kind of deep commentary on the show-biz world.
Think of it more as an acid-tipped mash note from down under.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not really being critical of it (Hollywood), I just think
the opera's fun,'' says the 59-year-old director, whose keen eye
for social behavior has been noted in movies like ``Breaker
Morant,'' ``Driving Miss Daisy'' and ``Black Robe.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's quite amusing to update it to Hollywood,'' Beresford
continues. ``I don't see the production as a vicious satire on
Hollywood mores. I mean, I've got nothing against them. I've had a
good time. I've made a lot of films and made a lot of friends. I
don't hate them. But it's fun to update it to Hollywood. I think
it's actually rather nice that a story like this can actually work
in Hollywood.''
</P>
<P>
   With this vision in mind, Beresford spent a couple of days
scouting Los Angeles with a camera, just as he would for a movie
shoot.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was kind of funny, going into the courtyards of people's
houses and taking pictures,'' he recalls with a chuckle. ``A few
times, they came out and said, `Well, what are you doing, what's
going on here?' Very hard to explain! I didn't have time to go
rushing around getting permission and all that. I mean, most of it
was perfectly harmless. And there was nothing I photographed that's
actually reproduced in the set. I used them as references _ they're
not copied.''
</P>
<P>
   Beresford then presented his photos to set designer John
Stoddart, a fellow Aussie and past collaborator who lives not far
from Beresford's permanent home in Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   Stoddart began crafting models of such essential Tinseltown
locales as a producer's mansion and a seedy Venice Beach hotel. For
the opening scene, set at the producer's party for his new movie,
Beresford even shot a 2 1/2-minute film that will be projected on
an overhead screen.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a kind of film noir. Quite fun to do. We had very little
money. I was pulling favors in from all over Australia, getting
people to do it. I got a top cameraman to do it for nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   And since no self-respecting Hollywood player would be caught
dead in anything but the latest high-priced casual chic, Stoddart
suggested that costume designer Johann Stegmeir outfit the cast in
sleek adaptations of Gucci, Prada and Armani.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an opera about rich, powerful people,'' Stegmeir says,
``and so starting with that, we were going to need clothing of a
certain quality, a certain theatricality, which instantly means
you're not going to be at Marshall's buying this stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   The costuming particularly takes its cues from Armani, whose
famous namesake collaborated directly with Stegmeir and whose
Beverly Hills salon hosted the aforementioned kickoff cocktail
party.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is so tied to the Hollywood community,'' Stegmeir says.
``When Armani hit Los Angeles for the first time, he actually
changed the way we look at fashion in the United States. With
`American Gigolo,' he did those suits, and it set a tremendous
precedent. He had an instant star following.''
</P>
<P>
   That left one last item crucial to any ladder-climbing Hollywood
clothes horse: sunglasses.
</P>
<P>
   Trend-setting LA Eyeworks, which has furnished distinctive
lenses for movies like ``Blade Runner,'' ``Rain Man'' and ``Thelma
&AMP; Louise,'' as well as for the Robert Wilson-Philip Glass 3-D
opera, ``Monsters of Grace,'' was recruited to create and supply
some 50 pairs of glasses for ``Rigoletto.'' Several characters
change eyewear several times during the three-act opera, an apt
motif for a city built around its own self-perceptions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Los Angeles is the quintessential sunglasses town,'' says LA
Eyeworks co-owner and designer Gai Gherardi. ``Something about a
movie star, something about sunglasses makes them available and not
available at the same time. It's not only about deception. It could
also be about an excruciating vulnerability.''
</P>
<P>
   Even in its own relatively sedate time, ``Rigoletto'' aroused
strong, even violent feelings. It was briefly banned by Venice's
Department of Public Order due to what a censor described as ``the
disgusting immorality and obscene triviality of the plot,'' which
Verdi derived from a Victor Hugo story.
</P>
<P>
   Apart from its passionate score, which the director says
contains more great tunes than any opera besides ``Carmen,''
Beresford also was attracted to ``Rigoletto's'' stormy emotional
conflicts. He says he generally gravitates toward operas with
well-crafted narrative lines that can be sung and acted
naturalistically, mentioning Benjamin Britten (whose ``Billy Budd''
will be seen here in June) and American composer Carlisle Floyd
(``Susannah'') as two favorites.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd never do Wagner,'' he confesses, sotto voce. ``!ital!Hate
Wagner. Bores me silly. They go on and on and on, one tune
endlessly repeated, static action, amazingly silly stories, I can't
believe how goofy they are.''
</P>
<P>
   Backstage, Beresford gets high marks from his singers, who
appreciate his sensitivity to the differences between acting off a
movie screenplay, which leaves room to improvise, vs. following a
libretto and a score with fixed time signatures.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's very accommodating,'' says mezzo-soprano Megan Dey-Toth,
who performs the role of Giovanna.
</P>
<P>
   As a filmmaker who moonlights in opera houses, Beresford belongs
to a select company that includes John Schlesinger, William
Friedkin, Franco Zeffirelli and the young Canadian director Atom
Egoyan.
</P>
<P>
   Like many people, he's at a loss to explain why more brand-name
auteurs aren't interested in opera.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most directors that I know don't know anything about it,'' he
says. ``In fact, most have never even seen one.''
</P>
<P>
   But if Hollywood poses little threat to Milan as the world opera
capital, Beresford doubts it ever will lose its primacy as a place
where great stories can be told. Fixated on movies since childhood,
he still longs to someday shoot a classic western like those
Randolph Scott pictures he watched as a boy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think (Hollywood) will always be the center of film
production,'' he says. ``It's still the big place.'' &QL;

`THE MATRIX,' `BEING JOHN MALKOVICH' TAKE EDDIE AWARDS
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   They may not be the closely watched Oscar bellwethers that the
Screen Actors Guild or Directors Guild awards are, but that doesn't
stop the American Cinema Editors from throwing quite a bash for
their annual Eddie Awards.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday evening at the Beverly Hilton Hotel, about 500 people
watched as the hefty statuettes were handed out in film and
television categories.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Matrix'' and ``Being John Malkovich'' were the big
winners, for drama and comedy film editing respectively.
</P>
<P>
   TV winners included episodes of top-rated shows ``Ally McBeal''
and ``Frasier,'' along with TV movies ``Pirates of Silicon Valley''
and ``Introducing Dorothy Dandridge.''
</P>
<P>
   The Terminator and the King of the World were also on hand, as
Arnold Schwarzenegger gave writer-director James Cameron, who is
also a member of ACE, the Golden Eddie Filmmaker of the Year Award.
</P>
<P>
   Cameron spoke of his great respect for the editing process: He
said on ``Titanic,'' the fact that Fox allowed the release date to
be pushed back several months gave the filmmakers enough time to
craft a million feet of film into the monster hit it became.
</P>
<P>
   Comedian Byron Allen hosted the event, which went a little long
as the tributes flowed for career achievement award winners Marge
Fowler (not present due to health problems) and Dann Cahn.
</P>
<P>
   Other celebrity presenters included Billy Zane, Thora Birch,
Bill Paxton and Dwight Yoakam. Following is a list of the 1999
Eddie Award winners:
</P>

Malkovich.''

DIALLO TRIAL'S LEGACY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The verdict in the Amadou Diallo case only settles one score.
The Bronx case of four white police officers accused of murder for
killing Diallo, who is black, ended in acquittal on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   There were protests but no riots _ an impressive public display
of nonviolent outrage over a shooting that occurred because police
thought Diallo had a gun. What police saw turned out to be his
wallet.
</P>
<P>
   A civil law suit against the four officers is likely. But gaping
issues remain unaddressed.
</P>
<P>
   How do New Yorkers and the nation move forward from here? Both
minority and white citizens point angrily to excessive police
activities. How do police departments at least dampen the
likelihood of another such tragedy? Should policies and procedures
be changed? Should New York's Street Crime Unit _ the special team
the four acquitted officers belonged to _ be overhauled? How do
police departments convince African-American and other minority men
that they are not reflexively considered guilty until proven
innocent?
</P>
<P>
   These are questions with national implications. No matter how
good their local police force is, some people across the country
will conclude that the Diallo case is business as usual, that under
the banner of public safety minority lives are chewed up and spit
out by police. It's a corrosive impression that threatens the
genuine progress of police forces and communities that work
together successfully.
</P>
<P>
   New York touts its zero-tolerance policing. But a 1998 report
prepared for the Department of Justice suggests that these policies
can erode police legitimacy. Minor examples include ludicrous
crackdowns such as the case of a woman stopped in Brooklyn during a
``safety sweep'' and arrested for having failed to pay a ticket for
driving with a broken tail light. The worst result is an outrageous
death.
</P>
<P>
   Diallo's death should be heeded as a commandment to improve
frayed police-community relationships everywhere. This could take
many forms: public meetings, advanced training for police officers,
innovative school programs, more research on effective policing.
The name Amadou Diallo should now be a rallying cry for change.

INCREDIBLE APOLOGY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Texas Governor George W. Bush is running astray of one of the
fundamental tenets of presidential politics: that issue positions
should spring from where the candidate's head and heart are, not
his feet.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's remarkable letter to New York's Cardinal John O'Connor,
regretting that he failed to distance himself adequately from
anti-Catholic and race bias when he visited Bob Jones University in
South Carolina, sounds an instant credibility alert.
</P>
<P>
   Many New Yorkers will see just as much raw opportunism in Bush's
answer to the Catholic archbishop, just 10 days before the New York
primary, as in his decision to make Bob Jones U. his first South
Carolina stop after losing New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   No one has accused Bush of personal prejudice; his record would
indicate the opposite. But he is neither naive nor a fool. He picks
his campaign stops for good reason. The Bob Jones speech was an
unmistakable signal of solidarity with the Christian right, and it
paid off handsomely _ in the short run. But once Bush had pocketed
the badly needed victory in South Carolina, he could not walk away
from the campaign that had given it to him.
</P>
<P>
   This is the way it is and must be in presidential campaigns.
Though the calendar describes a series of state-by-state contests,
national concerns like race and religion cannot be fudged to
attract a particular audience.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Arizona Senator John McCain is attempting to make Bush pay
a price for his bargain with the Christian right. Monday, McCain
called evangelist Pat Robertson an ``agent of intolerance'' and
said some of the charges Robertson had made against McCain
supporters were divisive. Republicans, he said, ``are the party of
Ronald Reagan, not Pat Robertson . . . of Abraham Lincoln, not Bob
Jones.''
</P>
<P>
   This exchange is not the most elevating of the primary season.
But race and religious bias are crucial national issues. McCain
must be given credit for carrying his message to Robertson's home
state of Virginia, which holds its primary Tuesday, and delivering
a speech that tells the nation where he stands, not where he
happens to be standing.

   WASHINGTON _ Much of Sen. John McCain's public appeal is due to
his legendary candor and spontaneous wit, although humor has always
been risky and subject to misinterpretation in political combat.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican presidential candidate was grilled Sunday on ABC
News' ``This Week'' about some of his jokes that struck segments of
the population as offensive and distinctly non-funny. ``People say,
`Is that the way President McCain would speak in public about
things?''' the questioner observed disapprovingly.
</P>
<P>
   McCain chuckled. ``Yes. President McCain will use humor wherever
he can. Sometimes it will be poorly done and sometimes it will get
President McCain in trouble You can count on President McCain to
try to use humor to lighten up things ''
</P>
<P>
   Good for him. Politics is often a grim business. It needs all
the good-natured lubrication it can get. Smiles can help to bridge
the huge psychological and emotional gap between an isolated
president and the voters.
</P>
<P>
   Laughter is indispensable in a democracy. It allows us to get
along with one another socially while disagreeing intellectually
over public policy. And sometimes those who laugh together even
learn how to vote together.
</P>
<P>
   But jokes and quick quips shouldn't be examined too closely.
They are not meant to be taken literally but to make us smile. Like
frogs, they die if dissected.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's humor often has a cutting edge, although he is not as
sardonic as Bob Dole, the 1996 Republican nominee renowned for
having one of the quickest wits in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   A typical McCain line was his reaction to a friendly food fight
in a restaurant between reporters and some of his staff. Instead of
tut-tutting, he joked, ``That's what happens when you recruit from
the prison-release program.''
</P>
<P>
   Our most popular recent presidents were those with an infectious
sense of humor. Who could forget President Ronald Reagan, rushed to
a hospital with a grave wound from a would-be assassin's bullet,
telling his doctors from his sickbed, ``I forgot to duck''?
</P>
<P>
   Bill Clinton does well with the public funny bone too. His good
humor has carried him through impeachment and personal humiliation.
He is a master of the self-deprecating putdown. He once observed
that when he and Hillary Rodham Clinton arrived at the White House
in 1993, a veteran reporter demanded a security deposit.
</P>
<P>
   John F. Kennedy was the first modern president to embrace humor
as an essential governing tool. His chief speech writer, Theodore
Sorensen, recalled in his post-assassination book, ``Kennedy,''
that ``no laugh-getter once used or even considered was ever
discarded.'' But Kennedy was wary. In 1952 and 1956 Adlai
Stevenson's sophisticated, elitist humor had not prevented two
losses to Dwight Eisenhower, who had a nice smile but no comic
instincts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Candor and humor, when combined, can be dangerous weapons
politically; so at times he (JFK) had to restrain his natural
instincts in this direction,'' Sorensen wrote, in classic
understatement.
</P>
<P>
   Even Kennedy's younger brother Robert, not known for a natural
sense of humor, understood its uses. ``I'm not ruthless,'' he told
a crowd during his 1968 presidential campaign. ``If I find a man
who says that, I'll destroy him.''
</P>
<P>
   But we have managed to live with presidents who have no sense of
humor. We solve the problem by laughing at them, rather than with
them. Richard Nixon, that sour paranoid, comes first to mind. ``How
do you like your job?,'' he once asked a motorcycle cop lying in a
street who had just taken a tumble and broken his leg.
</P>
<P>
   Jimmy Carter's killer rabbit was roundly ridiculed, in large
part because he didn't see the comical aspects of his claim that a
bunny was pursuing the presidential boat in a pond at Plains, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   President George Bush was more often funny when he wasn't trying
than when he was. His tongue-tanglers were historic. His son, Gov.
George W. Bush, displays the same predilection for garbled syntax.
He seems like a genial enough fellow but he does not have McCain's
quick, whimsical temperament.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore has a ready wit that he usually
suppresses but has flashed frequently during his debates with the
dull, droll former Sen. Bill Bradley. If we want laughter in the
White House, our best bet is a contest between McCain and Gore.
Rolling in the aisles is no substitute for peace and prosperity,
but it is better than nothing.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, we are far beyond the days when a man determined to
keep his mouth shut like Calvin Coolidge could be president. ``You
don't have to explain something you haven't said,'' was his mantra.
</P>
<P>
   Let McCain be McCain and the explanations fill the airwaves.

SOVIET LEGACY LEAVES CHALLENGE FOR AMERICAN CENSUS

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Over coffee in her Ocean Avenue apartment in
Brooklyn, Fira Stukelman recalled the Communist Party man coming to
her village in Ukraine, with census forms and orders to answer all
the questions. Each time she denied that she and her children were
Jewish, and hoped the state would leave them alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``You were afraid to say you were Jewish,'' said Stukelman, 66,
who immigrated to the United States in 1989. ``Everyone who was
Jewish said their language is Russian. It would be terrible for
your job.''
</P>
<P>
   Jobs, education and homes _ anything controlled by the
government _ was in play if someone's answers didn't fit the
seemingly arbitrary purposes of the Soviet head count. The Soviet
Union is no more, but it has left a unique challenge for the U.S.
Census Bureau in its attempt to count the nation's Russian-speaking
community for the first time. Census workers must overcome
immigrants' mistrust of the former Soviet Union, especially for
Jews, who constitute a large majority of Russian immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're talking about people leaving the Russian government,
the most mistrustful government in the world,'' said Alex Krasny,
41, a Brighton beach businessman and member of Community Board 13.
``They come from being under pressure for many years, where you
couldn't say, `No, no,' and not answer.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, the government man spreading the word about census
participation isn't dreaded. That's because Gene Borsh, 52, a
``community partnership specialist'' with the Census Bureau, is
also Russian, Jewish and a recent immigrant. He is one of hundreds
working full time with the Census in the New York metropolitan area
to help its count in ethnic neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to determine exactly how many Russians live in the
city. The city's most recent figure for Russian-speaking immigrants
says 106,954 were living in all five boroughs in 1996. The census
does not count immigration status.
</P>
<P>
   Krasny has no idea how many Russian immigrants live in Brighton
Beach. ``Some people are saying 100,000,'' he said, ``some say
20,000.''
</P>
<P>
   With most of the Russian emigres arriving since the breakup of
the Soviet Union in 1991, this will be the first chance to formally
count how many are living here. Since last summer, Borsh has held
meetings with civic and religious organizations and pushed his
message to the influential Russian-language newspapers in the
attempt to get everyone on board.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's different that what we had back in Russia,'' Borsh said.
``It's the only way [for people) to express their needs to the
government.''
</P>
<P>
   Congress disburses some $180 billion dollars in Federal funding
each year, according to the Census Bureau, and much of that is
based on population data. Undercounts deny funding, and especially
hurt emerging communities. Brooklyn Borough President Howard
Golden, in an October 1999 letter of support for the Census, said
his borough was under-counted by 472,000 in 1990, and claimed a $1
billion loss in Federal aid for the decade.
</P>
<P>
   Borsh says he points up figures like these and plays to
Russians' willingness to integrate with American society. But for
recently arrived Russian-speaking immigrants, it can be a tougher
sell.
</P>
<P>
   Stukelman, vice president of the Association of Holocaust
Survivors from the Former Soviet Union, did not answer the 1990
census, which circulated less than a year after she arrived. Her
husband died before she, her two adult children and grandchildren
left the Soviet Union in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   Stukelman remembered being ``too scared to pick up the
telephone,'' and said even going through the checkout line at a
grocery store was a frightening experience if one couldn't speak
the language.
</P>
<P>
   Krasny, who has worked with Borsh through Community Board 13,
said this is typical of recent immigrants. He said there are many
in the community concerned with family first and citizenship
second.
</P>
<P>
   It takes only about five minutes to answer the short form, which
will be mailed to every household beginning in April. One in six
homes will receive a longer questionnaire the Census uses in
sampling more complex demographics. Some of the questions _
household income, nationality, language spoken _ are similar to the
ominous-sounding Soviet queries. Borsh suspected that several might
answer ``Jewish'' for nationality, knowing now that it won't be
used against them.
</P>
<P>
   Max Norat, a spokesman for Census 2000 in New York City, doesn't
think the questions will create many problems, and said there will
be nearly 70 Russian-speaking volunteers staffing Census help desks
in the metropolitan New York area.
</P>
<P>
   In other emerging immigrant communities, Norat said, illegal
immigrants who suspect a deportation trap are the toughest to
convince they should participate. That doesn't appear to be an
issue for Russians, which constitute the city's largest source of
new, legal immigrants. Of the estimated 5 million illegal
immigrants in the country, 19,000 come from the former Soviet
Union, according to Immigration and Naturalization Service figures.
</P>
<P>
   Nikolai Kvasnyuk, a community partnership specialist working
with the Seattle-area Russian community, said apathy is also a part
of why some Russians avoid the government.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people who came from the Soviet Union are pretty
indifferent toward government,'' he said. ``They don't want to have
anything to do with it. There's no time or desire to even think
about the census.''
</P>
<P>
   Kvasnyuk also has no idea how many Russians live in the
Seattle-Tacoma area; the 1990 census put it about 10,000.
</P>
<P>
   Once candidates for elective office become aware of how many
Russian voters are living in Brooklyn, Krasny reasoned, they will
begin to include them in their campaign. Norat agreed the Census is
often the first step an emerging community takes in gathering
political power.
</P>
<P>
   The Russians also hope that being included in the census data
will result in Americans seeing them as more a part of the
community, and break down stereotypes.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could say there is a `Berlin wall' between the
Russian-speaking people and American-born people,'' Krasny said.
Much of this is based on Russian senior citizens who participate in
government entitlement programs. Stukelman said that relationship
is a new experience for many Russians, who had long accepted they
had little say in their government.
</P>
<P>
   The census is also helping some put their past in the past.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, there is a mistrust that those people brought from
the Soviet Union,'' Krasny said, ``but little by little it's going
away.''  &QL;

<P>
   NEW YORK _ That whole '80s glitzy sequined thing is back. So are
reptile skins, jeweled sandals, polka dots, ruffles and ripped
jeans.
</P>
<P>
   Unappealing, you think? Think again. When ``fashion forecaster''
Pat Tunsky first announced that jean jackets were back, people in
the industry thought she was crazy. Four years later, denim is
everywhere, from the latest Gap ads to clothes racks at
Bloomingdale's and Barneys.
</P>
<P>
   A forecaster with the Doneger Group in Manhattan, Tunsky is paid
to think well ahead of the times. Twice each year, she meets with
designers or retailers who want to know what colors, trends and
fabrics will be hot for the next season. Her firm charges $7,000
for a year of forecasts, while other forecasters charge as much as
$150,000 for big projects. Industry analysts say the results are
worth the price.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's expensive, but you can't afford not to use forecasters
anymore,'' said John Simone, a professor at New York's Fashion
Institute of Technology. ``The mentality now is that a major
mistake in direction can result in a catastrophe.''
</P>
<P>
   Forecasting emerged as a consulting niche in the 1970s, after
the failed transition from mini- to maxi-skirts saddled retailers
with thousands of shin-grazing skirts. Today, forecasters intervene
at all levels of the industry, Simone said, advising clothiers on
the wants and needs of the public, and giving Wall Street
investment banks a window on the viability of fashion houses going
public. Since most high-end designers do their own forecasting, the
cottage industry of forecasting firms is geared towards retailers
and brand names that sell millions of units per year.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is nothing frou-frou about forecasters,'' said Prof.
Polly Guerin, another professor at FIT. ``They are the eyes and
ears of the industry, and are a vital part of the auxiliary fashion
business.''
</P>
<P>
   Youth Intelligence, a company that forecasts fashion and other
trends for the youth, advises Levi's, Calvin Klein's CK line and
Benetton. The firm's president, Jane Rinzler Buckingham, said Youth
Intelligence finds trends by following fashion-forward designers,
scoping out the streets of London, Los Angeles or New York, and
monitoring eclectic boutique wares.
</P>
<P>
   ``We look for people with great intuition and great passion,''
she said, ``who care about trends.''
</P>
<P>
   Forecasters who specialize in technical aspects of the business
like colors and fabrics also rely on extensive knowledge of the
industry and common sense. Tunsky, whose expertise is colors,
credited her 26 years in advertising, retail and forecasting with
bolstering her ability to look into the future.
</P>
<P>
   To forecast the comeback of jean jackets, for instance, she took
note of young women in Europe wearing denim jackets juxtaposed with
work clothes for the office, and noticed also that cutting-edge
designers like Helmut Lang showed denim on their runways.
</P>
<P>
   Forecasting may have begun as a safety net for retailers, but
Tunsky says there is less pressure for each firm to be accurate
today because retailers often consult more than one forecasting
firm. She encourages her clients to subscribe to more than one
service. Saks Fifth Avenue, a Doneger client, also uses the
forecasting firm Here and Now, ``just to make sure everybody is on
the same wavelength,'' said Saks fashion coordinator Diane
Cisneros.
</P>
<P>
   Most forecasters admit the road to new trends is littered with
past season's failures. Few, however, will acknowledge having
goofed. Tunsky insisted that she has never bombed. Rinzler
Buckingham said she was sure her company had made ``lots'' of
mistakes, but couldn't remember any.
</P>
<P>
   Predicting trends is easy compared to the challenge of changing
the retailers' mentality, forecasters say.
</P>
<P>
   ``Retailers want to be safe, and stick with what sells, at the
risk of saturation,'' Tunsky said.
</P>
<P>
   The recent cargo pant overload, for instance, was a trend
saturation, with retailers unwilling to pull back when forecasters
advised them to do so. Unsold cargo pants filled storerooms all
over the country. The next saturation, Tunsky predicts, will come
with ``the whole bohemian, gypsy embellished look,'' a trend she
says hasn't even peaked yet.
</P>
<P>
   Despite their complaints about the stodginess of retailers,
forecasters themselves are sometimes accused of lacking
originality. Simone, of FIT, dubs them ``the fashion equivalent of
polling.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They have helped the business in many ways,'' he added, ``but
have hurt it by stifling creativity.''
</P>
<P>
   Vincent Daudin, a forecaster at Victoria's Secret, said that
among top designers, forecasters are still a dirty little secret.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a `snobisme,''' Daudin explained in his native French.
``The biggest designing houses will never tell you that they buy
forecasting services, it makes them look weak.''
</P>
<P>
   However, he said, the industry is changing and more designers
admit to relying on trend forecasters.
</P>
<P>
   So what are other long-term trends foreseen by industry experts?
</P>
<P>
   The comeback of ``neo-classicism,'' a put-together look
epitomized by ``Yves Saint Laurent in the '70s,'' said Tunsky.
</P>
<P>
   As to the forecasters' own wardrobes, sometimes less is more.
</P>
<P>
   ``You get so caught up in trends,'' Rinzler Buckingham
explained, commenting on her ``boring black dress,'' ``that you
just get really tired of the whole thing.''
</P>

   PHOENIX - `We sit somewhere in between, I like to think, HBO and
the traditional Big Three (networks). When we get it right, it's
cultural-phenomenon time. And when we get it wrong, it's ugly.''
</P>
<P>
   Sandy Grushow, chairman of the Fox Television Entertainment
Group, spoke those words to TV critics last month in California as
part of his assertion that Fox was weaning itself of ``reality
programming `(When Animals Attack,` etc.).
</P>
<P>
   Just a guess, but I'd say `Who Wants To Marry a
Multimillionaire,` the shipwreck that just gets worse as the days
go on, falls into the latter category. And like a broken record,
Grushow is at it again, telling various media outlets that the
Multimillionaire fiasco means no more exploitative reality TV. I'll
bet this time he really, really means it.
</P>
<P>
   The bigger story here _ the one lost in all the vapid
newsmagazine interviews and office chatter _ is how, with the
notable exception of Malcolm in the Middle, the Fox network can't
do anything right. Just when you thought a disastrous season
couldn't get worse _ and for one bright, shining,
lowest-common-denominator moment, Marry a Multimillionaire looked
like a winner _ it did. Note to Fox: You get yourself out of holes
with ladders, not shovels. In other words, stick with the plan
Grushow gave lip service to earlier and dump this kind of garbage. &QL; 
Spin City will be back next season, even without star Michael J.
Fox. Charlie Sheen will replace him, reportedly at $125,000 an
episode.
</P>
<P>
   Charlie Sheen? Since when did he become a show saver?
</P>
<P>
   When Fox bowed out of the sitcom _ a pleasant-enough little
show, if only a blip in TV history _ because of Parkinson's
disease, it seemed to spell the end of the show.
</P>
<P>
   It should've. It would have been a classy move. &QL; 
First Freaks and Geeks, then Sports Night _ is anyone else sick and
tired of networks yanking good-but-struggling shows during sweeps
periods? Do we really need more chances to see Twenty-One and
repeats of Dharma and Greg? &QL; 
Viewers tuning in to see David Letterman's return from quintuple
bypass surgery may have been surprised to see him in something
close to his old NBC (or at least early CBS) form. They shouldn't
have been; The Late Show has been on a creative roll for months. &QL;

DRUGS AND ALCOHOL OVERWHELM URBAN NATIVE AMERICANS

   NEW YORK _ Nancy Smith, 28, croaks about the cold weather with a
smoked-out voice. Dressed in a sweatshirt and jeans, her puffy eyes
tell a story of chronic alcoholism, an all-too-common syndrome
among Native Americans like her. After returning from a cigarette
break in sub-zero temperatures, Smith flops down on a couch, curls
herself into a ball and falls asleep. One of New York City's
homeless, she has come for the treatment of her drinking problem.
</P>
<P>
   Smith and thousands like her are seeking help for their
substance abuse at the American Indian Community House, the largest
of a handful of Native American cultural institutions in the New
York area. ``Where else can I go for help?'' she asks. ``Any place
else, they don't understand you like they do here.''
</P>
<P>
   Native Americans around the country are leaving reservations and
relocating in urban areas at a dizzying rate. With economic
opportunities on reservations lagging behind those available in big
cities, and with the unemployment rate among Native Americans at
three times the national average, thousands of poor, often
unskilled Native Americans are rushing off their reservations. Many
find their new urban locales strange and forbidding and often turn
to drugs and alcohol.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 46,000 Native Americans live in the New York City
metropolitan area. Of that number, nearly 7,000 come to the
Community House each year for drug and alcohol rehabilitation,
health counseling or for job training, according to Rosemary
Richmond, executive director. This is up from around 3,000 just
seven years ago. With the vast majority of its $1.5 million annual
budget, mostly federal funds, going to substance abuse treatment
and job training, the Community House finds itself at risk of
losing the attendance of those in need of cultural support.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, some urban Native Americans feel driven away.
Richmond and her 30-member staff have been inundated with work, but
less and less of it involves cultural activities.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to go there all the time and hang out, meet new
people,'' says Carlos Rodriguez, 48, a Navajo who works as a
librarian at Columbia University. ``Now most of the people there
have drug problems, so they don't even let you in without an
appointment.''
</P>
<P>
   The Community House, established in 1969, relies on volunteers
like Rodriguez to participate in rallies, organize religious events
and educate the public about Native American culture. In recent
years, problems of illiteracy and addiction have become the major
part of the organization's workload.
</P>
<P>
   The social problems faced by Richmond and her staff are not
unique to New York City. From 1980 to 2000, the urban Native
American population has more than doubled. With this drastic
increase came a surge in urban Native Americans in need of
substance abuse treatment. In 1980, approximately 4,000 Native
Americans sought treatment for substance abuse in the San Francisco
area, according to the Indian Health Service, a branch of the U.S.
Department of Health and Human Services. Today, that number has
more than doubled, to 9,200. In Seattle over the same period,
addiction cases rose from 3,500 to 7,300. Over all, the rate of
substance abuse among Native American adults is over 20 percent
nationwide. And the migration from the reservations continues.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mostly, it's economics,'' says Joanne Dunne, a spokeswoman for
the Boston Indian Council, a nonprofit cultural group. ``The
reservation typically doesn't provide you with any real
opportunities.'' Also, many Native Americans travel between the
reservation and urban areas. ``Some tribes traditionally go from
one place to another,'' says Dunne. ``The Micmacs always crossed
the border from Canada to come from time immemorial.''
</P>
<P>
   In other cities, city and state governments have created
agencies to specifically deal with the Native American population.
In Detroit, for example, the municipal government runs the Detroit
American Indian Health Center, while the state of Michigan runs the
Bureau of Urban Indian Affairs. ``There's also American Indian
Health, which is nonprofit and state supported,'' adds Alycia
Atkinson, an administrator at Urban Indian Affairs. ``They do youth
programs, alcohol, tobacco and drug intervention, and other health
services. Then there's American Indian Services, which does mental
health, and also has a youth program, and they're run by the city.
And the state also supports the National American Indian
Association here.'' As the state and city governments slice up
their services, Detroit Native Americans, already a small group at
20,000, find themselves without a cultural or political center.
</P>
<P>
   In Boston, at Dunne's Boston Indian Council, attendance lags
because it does not provide substance abuse treatment, legal
services or on-site training programs. Still, it creates a sense of
community among members of 36 tribes from all over the nation.
``Indians are drawn together the same way as everyone else,'' she
explains. ``You look for people who look like you.''  &QL;

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Potholes large enough to swallow small children
dotted the streets of the Highbridge section of the South Bronx.
For years, however, city agencies had made no move to fix them.
</P>
<P>
   Then last autumn, the monthly Highbridge Horizon turned its eye
to the deteriorating streets. Horizon reporters, all local
residents trained in weekly journalism classes, published the
Department of Transportation's pothole hot line number, wrote
blistering articles, and, just in time for Halloween, recruited
local youth for the Great Pothole Hunt. Children decorated and
photographed the most horrific potholes, and the pictures ran in
the November issue.
</P>
<P>
   Two days after The Horizon hit the streets, work crews from the
Department of Transportation and the Department of Environmental
Protection started repairs. Mark Patterson, a spokesman for the
Department of Transportation, insists that The Horizon's role would
not have prompted the work. ``If they want to take credit, fine,
but nobody influences the DOT to fill potholes. I could have gone
past this pothole and called it in.''
</P>
<P>
   He's not convincing the Horizon staff.
</P>
<P>
   ``It only took them about five days to finish,'' says Yolando
Romero, 50, a Horizon reporter and community activist with
Neighbors in Highbridge, the group that started the paper in
December 1998. ``People said, `Wow, the paper can really make a
difference.' ''
</P>
<P>
   The monthly Horizon, in English and Spanish, covers a scant 10
blocks in a neighborhood slowly recovering from decades of violence
and poverty. ``The paper reports on issues that encourage more
people to become involved in improvement projects,'' says Joseph
Ryan, the 26-year-old editor in chief. He works for the federal
government's Volunteers in Service to America and is the only
non-Highbridge resident on staff. ``If residents take control of
the neighborhood, that can spread to surrounding areas.''
</P>
<P>
   That philosophy makes The Highbridge Horizon one of a handful of
small nonprofit newspapers that do more than cover the news; they
encourage community activism. Scraping by with private grants and
sometimes paid advertising, they are crusading journalists who see
their role as helping to spotlight and improve Bronx neighborhoods
long overlooked by the mainstream press.
</P>
<P>
   Matthew Lee, editor of the 13-year-old Inner City Press, says
news outlets like his serve a hungry readership. Lee occasionally
searches the Sunday New York Times for references to the Bronx. He
describes his count from a recent issue: ``Seventeen mentions of
the Bronx _ a few crimes, 12 weddings and a death in Riverdale.''
</P>
<P>
   Like the Highbridge Horizon, The Inner City Press, which has
evolved primarily into a website, has a particular bent. A group of
activists started the paper as a way to inform and organize
residents of the South Bronx around housing issues. Soon they found
themselves directly involved in legal and political battles against
banks and insurance companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``The injustice was so great,'' says Lee. ``People would knock
on our door after a article and ask, `So what are you going to do
about that?' ``
</P>
<P>
   Lee, who refuses paid advertisements, fosters an attacking style
of journalism.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had to think through `objective' journalism and veer from
the idea that the reporter has no active role,'' he says. The
news-starved communities in the Bronx apparently did not care about
this break with traditional journalism. At one time, before the
switch to the Internet, the paper circulated 32,000 free copies on
local stands and in bodegas, Lee says.
</P>
<P>
   The scrappy Bronx papers are not shy about claiming credit for
any improvements in their communities.
</P>
<P>
   The biweekly nonprofit Norwood News, serving the neighborhoods
of Norwood, Fordham Road and Bedford Park, says it helped speed the
construction of the long-delayed Public School 20 in Norwood. From
1994 to 1996, The News ran a barrage of stories and editorials
blasting the School Construction Authority for slow and sloppy
work. Although the construction ran three years over the original
three-year timetable, the News's publisher, Jordan Moss, is
convinced it would have dragged on even longer without pressure
from the paper.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got that story first and kept their feet to the fire,'' he
says. ``The SCA is still having problems all over the city but not
here. We had four schools built on time this fall.''
</P>
<P>
   Over in Highbridge, The Horizon continues its crusading ways by
publicizing a Neighbors in Highbridge campaign to improve local
mail service. The paper complains that the mail often is delivered
after 5 p.m. and sometimes is unceremoniously dumped in building
lobbies.
</P>
<P>
   ``After our stories on the mail service, we got people drumming
on the door complaining about the post office. Then we refer them
to Neighbors in Highbridge,'' Romero says.
</P>
<P>
   Down the street, the owner of Ralph's Grocery, Rafael Berrios,
agrees that The Horizon fosters community spirit. ``Since it came
out, a lot of people take it and talk about it,'' he says. ``It has
all the information, what is good and bad in Highbridge. It is just
one part of this whole neighborhood getting better.''

<P>
   NEW YORK _ At the age of 27, Isabel Kimmel reflects on her youth
as if it were 50 years ago, not just a few.
</P>
<P>
   Back then she was a professional ballerina with the New York
City Ballet in Lincoln Center. It was a world of ``exuberance and
innocence,'' she says. She and the members of her ballet company
referred to the world beyond the ballet as the ``outside world,''
and the people that belonged to it as ``civilians.'' A wonderful
bubble, she calls that former world in which she sailed across the
stage for the simple purpose of pleasing the eyes and moving the
hearts of an audience.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think of it as my very youthful time,'' said Kimmel, a woman
with wide, pensive brown eyes and the poise and lithe build of a
former ballerina.
</P>
<P>
   After 20 years, 8 of which were devoted to the New York City
Ballet, Kimmel sensed it was time for her to move on to that
outside world.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was spending my life in this theater with no windows,'' she
said. ``I felt there was so much out there that I wanted to be
exposed to. I felt there was a lot I didn't know.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Symphony in C,'' a Ballanchine ballet, was her last dance,
performed in Saratoga Springs, N.Y., in the summer of 1998. It was
also the first ballet she performed when she moved to New York from
Atlanta as a teen-ager in order to attend the American Ballet
School, the official school of the New York City Ballet.
</P>
<P>
   Now a senior at Barnard College in New York, majoring in English
literature, Kimmel said she thought of leaving ballet for a long
time. ``Dance is a short career. I wanted to leave while I felt
young and capable. I wanted to get my undergraduate degree before
age 30. I could have stayed for another five to eight years, but
then I'd be pushing it. The later I stayed, the less of an
advantage I'd have.''
</P>
<P>
   While many in other fields are reaching the peaks of their
careers, professional dancers find themselves thinking about an
unusually early retirement. As their bodies, as well as their
minds, tire of long rehearsals and constant travel and scrutiny,
dancers search for new careers, new friends, new lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's letting go of an identity,'' said Suzie Jary, director of
client services at Career Transitions For Dancers, a national
nonprofit arts service organization that helps professional dancers
identify and pursue new careers through career counseling.
Thirty-five percent of dancers who come to Career Transitions do
not have a college degree, Jary said. Besides providing career
assistance, the center also offers grants to help dancers, who
usually do not earn high salaries, pay for an education.
</P>
<P>
   A former dancer herself, Jary is now a licensed social worker.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm working with people who had their dreams or are working at
them, not people trying to find their dreams,'' she said, adding
that usually her own colleagues in social work help those searching
for their goals. The transition from dancer to ``civilian,'' Jary
said, is a kind of ``grieving process'' for a dancer that requires
letting go of something that has defined him or her for most of
their lives. Dancers ``don't have the credentials, income and
prestige of others.'' she said. ``For doctors, even if they retire,
they retain their title.''
</P>
<P>
   After leaving show business in his 50s, Ron Young, a former
dancer, singer, actor and director, found a new career in the
corporate world. Now an assistant vice president of corporate
heritage services at Merrill Lynch in New York, Young recalled his
own concerns upon retiring.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I decided I wanted to leave, I had no idea I had
transferable skills,'' he said. ``I didn't have any work outside of
show business.'' Through Career Transitions, he said, he learned
that he had and could develop marketable skills. The center
provided him with funding for computer training.
</P>
<P>
   Dancers have a high work ethic, he also noted. ``Dancers would
never dream of stopping in the middle of a dance routine,'' he
said. ``We finish the task at hand.''
</P>
<P>
   Now out of dance for four years, he said he never expected to be
wearing a suit and tie. However, he is happy.
</P>
<P>
   ``In show business you are judged every day of your life. It's
wearing after a while. I felt a burden removed.'' In his new
career, life is much more stable, he said, and the paycheck is
guaranteed.
</P>
<P>
   Although the loss of a life-encompassing livelihood causes a
sense of loss and confusion for dancers, many agree that there is
something else even more painful to leave behind _ their company.
The lifestyle of a dancer can be hard to leave, Jary said. ``Your
company becomes your family,'' she said. ``People miss that part.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That was hard,'' said Leda Meredith, 37, who retired from
performing two years ago. ``All of a sudden there would be entire
days when it was just me and my school books and I didn't talk to a
single soul. I had to learn to create a social life. I had to learn
to call people I hadn't seen, and reach out more.''
</P>
<P>
   Originally from San Francisco, Meredith moved to New York to
dance with the American Ballet Theatre II for several years, then
alternated between dancing for Jennifer Muller/The Works, a modern
dance company, and Dances ... Patrelle, both based in New York. At
35, however, Meredith decided to devote herself to a second
interest that had always competed with dance _ herbal medicine.
With the help of a grant from Career Transitions, Meredith began
taking courses in ethnobotany at the New York Botanical Gardens.
She expects to receive her bachelor's degree in a year and a half.
</P>
<P>
   Because of this second interest, Meredith said her transition
was somewhat easier than it is for other former dances.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had other things I was eager to begin to learn about,'' she
said. ``I started becoming more fascinated with things outside the
studio.'' And there was also the age factor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dance is short-lived,'' she said. ``I can work with plants
until I'm 90.'' Still, she keeps one foot on the stage by
choreographing and teaching dance.
</P>
<P>
   Kimmel is still thinking about what career she will pursue after
graduation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would dance again,'' she said. ``I feel better about having
a degree.'' When she watches performances, she said she misses it.
``I've only been out of the company for a year and a half. I have a
big sense of nostalgia.''

 By REBECCA WEBBER   
 c.2000 Columbia News Service    
  NEW YORK _ Yassine could be running his father's bus company in
Casablanca, Morocco, earning $5,000 a month. Instead, at 22, he
waits on tables at an Italian restaurant in SoHo, pocketing about
$50 _ on a good day.
<TEXT>
<P>
   In Casablanca, Yassine lived between his mother's home and a
spacious apartment he rented with friends. Now he sleeps on the
couch or the floor in a cramped one-bedroom he shares with two
other young Moroccans. He traded in his shiny blue Mercedes for the
commuter-packed E train.
</P>
<P>
   New York sees no shortage of transplants like Yassine who defy
the immigrant stereotype. Rather than attempting to replace native
poverty with American prosperity, these newcomers are here for a
good time. To get it, they have swapped comfortable lives abroad
for a mean Manhattan experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``People assume that those who go live in another country are
desperate,'' says Peter Stalker, a United Nations Development
Program expert on international migration. ``But it can be an
extension of their life experience. It's what's always happened
internally with kids moving to cities.''
</P>
<P>
   When he arrived in 1998 on a tourist visa, Yassine, who declined
to use his last name because he is in the country illegally,
anticipated a monthlong American vacation. He quickly met many
fellow foreigners and replaced the comforts of home with the
comfort of a close-knit young immigrant community that populates
some of the most fashionable neighborhoods of Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   When asked why he risked parental disapproval, financial
security and legal complications to remain on after his visa
expired, Yassine answers, ``To have an experience.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the number of foreign-born New Yorkers has risen
steadily, there is no count of the underground population to which
Yassine belongs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Increasingly, all the major international economic centers
attract people from all over the world,'' says Saskia Sassen, a
sociology professor at the University of Chicago and expert on
globalization. Young people, with few obligations in their native
countries, find the lure of what Sassen terms ``global cities''
irresistible.
</P>
<P>
   Guy Orban, a Belgian who married an American woman, explains,
``New York is what Paris used to be 30 years ago. Paris has become
boring, now New York is the place to go.'' Orban says that the
well-publicized turnaround of the once crime-infested city and the
affordability of international travel have increased the temptation
for foreigners.
</P>
<P>
   Young immigrants say they come to New York for a few years of
freedom after finishing school and before establishing careers.
After a few years in New York, some change their minds about
returning home.
</P>
<P>
   Max DiMatteo, 24, a former architecture student who came from
Italy in 1997, works as a waiter in a restaurant owned by his
cousin. He won't return to Italy now ``because the mentality is too
much behind.'' Though during his first months in America, he was
``feeling the distance,'' he says he now has adjusted to American
culture and married an American.
</P>
<P>
   Fara, a 21-year-old Parisian, ditched her mom's home and her
economics study at college to overstay her tourist visa in New
York. Working as a restaurant hostess in SoHo, she plans to return
to Paris in ``about five years.''
</P>
<P>
   Some, like Fara and Yassine, don't even bother to see if the
cumbersome immigration bureaucracy would grant them legal resident
permits and green cards for work. They say they have little trouble
finding jobs, often in stores and restaurants run by fellow
countrymen.
</P>
<P>
   Teiki Takamatsu, a SoHo jewelry store salesperson, says
opportunities to take on undocumented workers are prevalent,
although she said her store, with a ``Help Wanted'' sign in the
window, resists the temptation. ``We just turned away an Israeli
guy who doesn't have a green card,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Even some who sneaked into the country hoping for bigger things
say they accept the lowly status of a busboy or coat checker
because their time in New York is worth it.
</P>
<P>
   The mean Manhattan experience can teach ``what you can really do
by yourself,'' Yassine says.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are having a more interesting life,'' says Stalker.
Financial calculations don't always matter so much depending on
``where they place their emphasis, what they value.''

   ``Most marathoners come from poor families. We know how to
suffer.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Rolando Vera, after running the New York Marathon in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   The dragon spires of Mann's Chinese Theater in Hollywood mark
the first steps on many marathoners' Boulevard of Broken Dreams.
</P>
<P>
   The City of Los Angeles Marathon, mile 18. Muscles running on
empty. That coveted ``runner's high'' a dim memory. Some 33,660
footfalls down, roughly 15,300 more to go. Mostly uphill.
</P>
<P>
   Stop now and experience the closest thing to rigor mortis a
living person can feel. Runners call it ``the wall,'' a barrier
made up of dozens of aches and a million reasons to quit. That's
when mind becomes more important than muscle.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is, ultimately, all mental,'' said Dr. Joseph Haraszti, a
Pasadena physician and psychiatrist who has crossed the finish line
in six marathons. ``A marathon is full of ebbs and flows in the way
you feel. People talk about hitting the wall and getting a second
wind. I can tell you there's not just a second wind, but a third, a
fourth and a 10th wind.''
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, more than 21,000 runners will test their mental and
physical mettle against the L.A. Marathon's grueling 26.2-mile
course. Last year, 16,827 of the 21,630 people who signed up
crossed the finish line.
</P>
<P>
   Marathoners are unique human beings. Months of conditioning
transform them, almost literally, into running machines. Their
bodies burn waste faster, conserve energy longer and pump blood
more efficiently than most people's. They also have an iron will.
</P>
<P>
   ``The human body is amazing,'' said Dr. Rudra Sabaratnam, a
veteran runner and medical commissioner of the L.A. Marathon. ``You
can train it to do lots of things.''
</P>
<P>
   Marathon running is old-school extreme sport. As legend tells
it, in 490 B.C. an Athenian named Pheidippides inadvertently
invented the sport with a solo run _ 25 miles from Marathon to
Athens _ at top speed to deliver news of a crucial battle victory.
</P>
<P>
   Then he dropped dead.
</P>
<P>
   Pheidippides' fatal finale lingers in many beginning
marathoners' minds _ &UR;  &LR; especially when things get tough between
miles 18 and 24.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a daunting task,'' Haraszti said. ``Before I ran my first
marathon, I had this incredible anxiety. Somehow it just seems very
unnatural for any human being to run 26.2 miles; it seems we're
just not made for that.''
</P>
<P>
   It is unnatural, in a way.
</P>
<P>
   The so-called ``collapse distance'' _ the point where the human
body shuts down _ is about three times the normal exercise regimen.
Encino running coach Pat Connelly said people can generally push it
for about 15 miles before giving out. Anything beyond that requires
special training.
</P>
<P>
   Marathoners spends months tweaking their physiology to cover
those extra 9.2 miles.
</P>
<P>
   As a runner trains, increasing long-distance runs each week
(usually up to 18 or 20 miles about three weeks before the race),
the body learns to conserve glycogen _ muscle fuel. The heart gets
used to pumping faster and blood vessels stay constricted to keep
blood flowing to muscles. And as long as the runner takes in plenty
of fluids, electrolytes and carbohydrates, his or her body will
hold enough energy in reserve to finish a marathon.
</P>
<P>
   The training process is similar to climbing Mount Everest.
Climbers increase their altitude in increments to acclimate
themselves to thin air. Runners do it with distance.
</P>
<P>
   The ultimate marathoners are slim and not too muscular. For
example, Arnold Schwarzenegger would have a tough time running a
marathon. Muscles heat up as energy is burned and cool down through
the release of sweat, which saps the fluids. More muscles mean more
heat.
</P>
<P>
   Clothing can be another peril. Many runners _ especially men _
find their nipples are bleeding after only a few miles. The
condition is so common it has a name: ``runner's nipples.''
</P>
<P>
   ``At mile six, the first medical station, we get bombarded by
people who need Vaseline,'' said Sharon Zlotowicz, co-coordinator
of the L.A. Marathon's medical team. ``We go through 350 pounds of
it. When you run for so many miles, you start to chafe wherever
there are seams.''
</P>
<P>
   The feet also take a beating. Each step _ there are 49,000 in
all, according to coach Connelly _ puts three to four times the
runner's weight on the foot. Good shoes are critical shock
absorbers.
</P>
<P>
   Aches and pains are inevitable. But they don't make the race
impossible.
</P>
<P>
   Poor old Pheidippides would have appreciated the modern
amenities of the L.A. Marathon: 28 water stations (serving 50,000
gallons of water), 16,000 Mylar blankets, 11 medical units and 450
medical volunteers, 167 massage therapists and more than 21,600
runners. City of Angels Medical Center even has a field hospital at
the finish line.
</P>
<P>
   The mental hurdles are lowered by constant encouragement from
fellow runners and millions of spectators. At mile 25, the agony of
mile 18 (or 20 or 24, depending on where the wall first pops up)
vanishes in a rush of the brain's feel-good chemicals, adrenaline
and endorphins.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last mile is actually easier,'' Haraszti said. ``As you
near the finish line, your mind kind of takes over. You begin to
feel the end is in sight and dig deep. In my case, some of my best
mile times came at the end of a race. Your endorphins are working
overtime. It's almost like a drug high when you finish.'' &QL;

<P>
   NEW YORK _ While tourists often seek Revolutionary War sites in
Philadelphia, Valley Forge or Yorktown, a historical group wants to
draw them to a place better known for Coney Island and a baseball
team that left for Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   The group, the First Battle Revival Alliance is trying to build
a hiking trail as part of a $1 million effort to bring attention to
Battle of Brooklyn, the fledgling U.S. Army's first battle in the
Revolutionary War. All that remains today are a few obscure plaques
and a little-known monument in 526-acre Prospect Park.
</P>
<P>
   The group formed four years ago to restore a 17th-century Dutch
farmhouse, known as the Old Stone House, the site of a climactic
battle in August 1776 in which Maryland troops fought the English
as George Washington and his soldiers escaped across the river to
Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Too few Americans are aware that the survival of our nation
depended on this little known Battle of Brooklyn,'' said Susan
Miller, a retired schoolteacher who heads the historical group.
``Brooklyn's Revolutionary War history is second to none in
America, and yet the story is not known. A lot of people have
turned their backs on it because they feel Washington was
defeated,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Brooklyn historians, like John J. Gallagher in his 1995 book
``The Battle of Brooklyn 1776,'' assert that the valor shown at the
Old Stone House allowed Washington's troops to live to fight
another day.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed hiking trail is aimed at people like Alexis
Rehrmann, a 24-year-old theater administrator, who admitted she
knows ``almost nothing'' about Revolutionary War history in
Brooklyn. She heard about the restored farmhouse from a friend, and
she happened to move to Park Slope, the neighborhood of Brooklyn
brownstone homes that grew up east of the house.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came to check it out because it's a nice day, and I've heard
some story about George Washington watching the battle,'' Rehrmann
said. ``It never occurred to me that there were battles fought'' in
Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   A Battle of Brooklyn Trail would trace the course of the
fighting from British landings at the Narrows, where the
Verrazano-Narrows Bridge stands today, along routes they followed
to the Old Stone House and other battle sites. Like one in lower
Manhattan, the entire trail would be viewable by car, bus or
bicycle in about two hours. Visitors could walk along three
downtown segments, culminating at the Old Stone House, in about an
hour. The project, which is still in the planning stages, includes
several key parts:
</P>
<P>
   _ A two-by-three-foot tourist map would show a dozen key sites
on a map of colonial Brooklyn superimposed on the modern street
grid. Developing and printing several hundred thousand copies would
cost at least $100,000, though advertising could defray printing
costs.
</P>
<P>
   _ Two-by-three-foot signs would mark the key locations, and more
than 50 sites could receive smaller signs. A tentative budget pegs
the cost at $577,000.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Old Stone House would receive a memorial garden with
benches, a statue a 100-foot flagpole and plaques for about
$225,000.
</P>
<P>
   _ A special Battle of Brooklyn re-enactment in 2001 would
commemorate the 225th anniversary of the fighting and could cost
more than $80,000. Re-enactments this year and from 2002 to 2008,
marking the anniversary of British occupation of Brooklyn, would
cost about $40,000, or $5,000 each year.
</P>
<P>
   _ About $10,000 would be spent on ground-penetrating radar,
which can detect differences in density, such as stone walls or
loose earth such as burial fill. Other devices would detect minute
variations in the earth's magnetic field caused by buildings that
burned. The equipment would help locate the unmarked graves of
Maryland troops buried near the Old Stone House and remnants of a
small fort that stood in Prospect Park in 1776.
</P>
<P>
   First Battle Revival Alliance expects the project would take 5
to 10 years to complete at a cost of at least $1 million. The money
would be raised through grants and donations from individuals,
businesses and public sources, Miller said, discussing a
preliminary proposal.
</P>
<P>
   A Dutch immigrant built the Old Stone House in 1699 with
two-foot-thick walls near the Gowanus Creek, now a stagnant,
little-used shipping canal. During the Battle of Brooklyn in August
1776, the British used the house as an artillery position to fire
on American soldiers, many of whom drowned while trying to retreat
across the creek. Late in the 1800s, the building served as the
first clubhouse of the Brooklyn team of the National Base Ball
league, later known as the Brooklyn Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   Katie and Wade Beltramo, who moved last summer to just a few
blocks from the Old Stone House, are the kind of people the
organizers hope to attract. They volunteer in nearby Prospect Park,
where they heard about the battle at the Old Stone House during a
park ranger tour. They said they recently read about the
Revolutionary War, and joked they probably know more about it than
most Brooklyn residents.
</P>
<P>
   ``What does that say? That's a pretty sad statement,'' said Wade
Beltramo, 28, an attorney who moved to New York City five years
ago. He grew up in Iowa, which has no Revolutionary War history and
became a state only in 1846. New York history attracts him, he
said, because he can visit the spots where events took place.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm living right around the corner from this historic house,
which was the clubhouse for the Brooklyn Dodgers,'' he said.
``Wow!''
</P>
<P>
   Miller, the history group leader, is holding early talks with
other historical groups to determine which sites to include on the
map. Developing the trail is a mammoth project, and she seeks
tourism partners and help from businesses and museums.
</P>
<P>
   One local official praised the ``creative and ambitious
agenda,'' but worried the thorny New York City bureaucracy could
frustrate organizers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Naturally if there's some way we could support something like
that, we would,'' said Craig R. Hammerman, district manager of
Community Board 6, the neighborhood government body that covers the
area. ``I like the idea of the maps.''
</P>
<P>
   Brooklyn's official borough historian, John B. Manbeck, worried
that raising money also could challenge the group's effort.
Restoration of the Old Stone House came only after the Brooklyn
Borough President wrangled $750,000 for the project.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think the Revolutionary War is a popular war,''
Manbeck said. ``It doesn't have the attraction that the Civil War
has. Maybe it's too primitive to people.''
</P>
<P>
   The First Battle Revival Alliance remains undeterred.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a nationally significant site that really too few
Americans know about,'' Miller said.

CANADA REFUSES CUBAN DIPLOMAT PERMANENT PROTECTION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By COLIN NICKERSON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   OTTAWA _ Caught between two friends, Canada Monday took an
uncharacteristically tough line with Cuba, refusing to provide a
haven for a Cuban diplomat expelled from the United States after
being accused of spying.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign Minister Lloyd Axworthy said Canada would not grant a
Cuban government request to allow Jose Imperatori to remain at the
Cuban embassy in Ottawa, where the diplomat took refuge after being
ousted from the US over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he stays, he will be here illegally,'' Axworthy said.
</P>
<P>
   The implicit threat to take hard measures if Imperatori refuses
to leave voluntarily was the latest wrinkle in a strange saga that
one veteran Canadian diplomat described as ``theatre of the
absurd.''
</P>
<P>
   Imperatori, meanwhile, said through a spokesman at the Cuban
Embassy that he would continue a hunger strike to protest his
ejection from the United States.
</P>
<P>
   He did not make clear whether he would abide by Canada's request
that he immediately depart and return to Havana. For its part,
Canada did not make clear what, if anything, it can do if
Imperatori remains holed up at the embassy, which is sovereign
Cuban territory under international law.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a bizarre situation,'' Perry Sterling, a former
Canadian envoy to Cuba, told CBC Radio.
</P>
<P>
   The drama started last week when the US accused Imperatori of
conspiring with an official of the US Immigration and
Naturalization Service in acts of espionage. On Saturday night, he
was taken into custody by the FBI and flown aboard a US government
plane to Montreal, where he was supposed to board a commercial
flight to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   But the diplomatic deal brokered by Canada between Cuba and the
US fell apart when Imperatori failed to board the plane to Havana,
instead bolting for Ottawa and the Cuban embassy.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Havana started issuing public statements
accusing the US of dragging Canada into the fray and urged Ottawa
to allow Imperatori to remain in Canada until the US apologizes for
the spy allegations. Cuba claimed the 46-year-old vice-counsel at
the Cuban interests section in Washington was just a victim of the
high-profile battle over the fate of a Cuban boy, Elian Gonzalez,
who was plucked from the sea and taken to Florida by US rescuers
after his mother drowned last year while fleeing Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Imperatori Monday repeated threats to starve himself in Canada
to protest the US action. ``I have become the victim of a major
slander,'' he declared through an embassy spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Canada's initial befuddlement at the escapade turned to anger as
it became plain that Havana hoped to use Canada as a sort of pulpit
from which to denounce the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Canada has for decades been one of Cuba's most ardent defenders
on the international scene, and with the collapse of the Soviet
Union has emerged as perhaps Fidel Castro's most important economic
ally. Canadian firms are among the heaviest investors in Cuba, and
Canadian tourists represent a major source of hard currency.
</P>
<P>
   Those ties are an irritant to Washington, which has maintained
an economic embargo against the Western hemisphere's only communist
regime since 1963. Canada usually likes to flaunt the Cuban
connection as proof it maintains an independent foreign policy from
its overwhelming neighbor.
</P>
<P>
   However, Canada's championship of Cuba started to cool last year
after Castro _ ignoring pleas from Ottawa, European nations, and
human rights groups _ continued to suppress political dissidence,
imprisoning four well-known opposition activists after they
publicly called for democratic reforms.
</P>
<P>
   Axworthy had no words of sympathy for Imperatori's situation.
``All we were doing was providing a diplomatic courtesy,'' Axworthy
said. ``There will be no extension of his transit visa.''

FOR ONE COUPLE, AFRICAN-AMERICAN ART COLLECTION IS A LABOR OF

<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  NEW YORK _ As John and Vivian Hewitts' marriage has flourished
over the past 50 years, so has their collection of African-American
art, which now includes hundreds of paintings and drawings in one
of the nation's most comprehensive private collections.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the Bank of America bought 58 pieces of art from the
couple. The assembled artwork, now known as The Hewitt Collection,
is currently touring the country and will be permanently housed in
the Afro-American Cultural Center in Charlotte, N.C., beginning in
2002.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have some major artists in their collection, and it
captures the breadth of African-American artists' works over the
last 50 years,'' said June Kelly, 50, owner of a SoHo art gallery
that features works by African-American artists.
</P>
<P>
   The Hewitt Collection, comprising works by important black
artists that show a broad range of styles and periods, is the
result of the Hewitts' interests in documenting black history,
people, and everyday life and display the couple's pride in their
own African-American heritage.
</P>
<P>
   ``The collection challenges the idea of what African-American
art could be,'' said Todd Smith, 34, curator of American art for
The Mint Museum of Art in Charlotte, N.C. ``It doesn't just have
art that depicts the so-called black experience but it speaks to
the individual interests of the artists.''
</P>
<P>
   The eclectic collection includes a painting by Henry O. Tanner
(1869-1937), a black artist who is best known for the religious
themes he developed in his career. Tanner is the first American
artist of African descent to gain worldwide recognition. His
landscape painting, ``Sand Dunes at Sunset, Atlantic City,'' in
October 1997 became the first artwork by a black painter to enter
the White House's collection.
</P>
<P>
   The Hewitt Collection also features two paintings by Jonathan
Green, whose works illustrate the young artist's desire to narrate
and record the seaside activities and traditions of the Gullah
culture, central to black communities on small islands off the
South Atlantic coast. Green's painting graces the cover of the
catalog for the traveling exhibition, entitled ``Celebration and
Vision: The Hewitt Collection of African-American Art.''
</P>
<P>
   The Hewitts had an abiding love for art long before they met. As
a child, John would clip illustrations from magazines to decorate
his walls. Vivian, meanwhile, was fascinated by a reproduction of
Francois Millet's ``The Gleaners,'' which decorated her childhood
home.
</P>
<P>
   They met in Atlanta in 1949, where he taught English at
Morehouse College and she taught library science at Clark Atlanta
University. ``We had a whirlwind romance,'' Vivian said, relaxing
with a cup of hot tea in their Upper West Side apartment. ``We met
in September and got married in December of that year.''
</P>
<P>
   They began collecting art when they spent their honeymoon
visiting museums in New York City. With the cash they received as
wedding gifts, they bought reproductions of modern masterpieces by
Pablo Picasso and Georges Braque. Vivian said the posters were the
first of many more artworks to adorn their apartment.
</P>
<P>
   In 1952, they moved to New York City, where they slowly began to
circulate in artistic circles. John's sister, Adele Glasgow, ran a
gallery named ``The Marketplace'' in Harlem in the late 1950s that
featured African-American artists, and the Hewitts came to know
many of them. Soon the couple was buying and building their own
collection of African-American art, acquiring about five or six
works of art per year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We use birthdays, anniversaries, Mother's Day, Father's Day,
and Valentine's Day as an excuse to buy each other paintings,''
Vivian said.
</P>
<P>
   Being of modest means _ he worked as a reporter for scientific
magazines and she worked as a librarian _ the Hewitts often
struggled to close deals. Still, they found ways to invest in art.
``We bought what we liked and what we could afford,'' Vivian said.
``If we saw a piece that was beyond our means, we'd arrange for a
layaway plan with the gallery or the artist.'' They also focused on
Haitian paintings because they spent many of their vacations there
and because the pieces were affordable.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it helps to have friends in the art world. In 1963, they
purchased their first abstract painting from the African-American
artist Eugene Grigsby. Grigsby, an art professor at Arizona State
University, is also Vivian Hewitt's cousin and he helped introduce
them to the leaders of Harlem society. John Biggers, a painter and
retired art professor at Texas A&AMP;M, is also related to Vivian.
Through their connections, the couple inherited a Jacob Lawrence
ink illustration in 1979 from the poet Langston Hughes, who was a
friend of Glasglow's. Over the years, they let artists use their
spacious apartment as a gallery space to show their artworks.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's unique about the collection is that the majority of the
artists are people the collectors knew,'' said Smith, the
exhibition's curator who wrote an introduction and essay for the
catalog.
</P>
<P>
   The couple's relationship with the artists can be seen in many
of the artworks. An inscribed poster by Jonathan Green, for
instance, hangs by the entrance door of their apartment.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Hewitts have always shown their enthusiasm for my art over
the years,'' said Green, 44, who now lives in Naples, Fla. ``They
have been instrumental in introducing other collectors to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Their contribution to the black art world includes philanthropic
work as well. They have donated their art to several public
collections, including Vivian's alma mater, Geneva College. They
regularly lend their art to national touring exhibitions such as
``Hidden Heritage,'' a groundbreaking show that introduced
African-American artists to the country in the late 70s.
</P>
<P>
   Today, in their 70s the couple is in retirement. Last December,
they renewed their wedding vows at Harlem's St. Philips Episcopal
church. They live quietly and travel occasionally. John, whose
health has been failing lately, has been staying at home while
Vivian attends the openings and closings of their exhibits. (From
Feb. 14 to April 23, the Hewitt Collection will be at the Clark
University Art Gallery in Atlanta. From May 15 to July 23, the
collection will be at the Portfolio Gallery in St. Louis. And from
Aug. 13 to Oct. 14, the collection will be at the Howard University
Art Gallery in Washington, D.C.) ``Each time I go to a new venue,
the art collection looks different and new to me because they're
displayed in different ways,'' she said gleefully.

   Some of the artworks remain in their spacious apartment. The
first Haitian painting they bought hangs above the kitchen cabinet.
Entitled ``Three Haitian Women,'' the colorful tempera painting by
Luckner Lazard features the heads and torsos of three women. ``My
husband, my son John and I love the color and the composition of
this one,'' Vivian said. She pointed to a recent purchase, a small
painting that shows a group of Haitian dancers by the Cuban artist
Emilio Sanchez, which she likes ``for its simplicity.'' Vivian said
she doesn't have a favorite painting, insisting that she and John
love all of their paintings equally. ``You live with your art and
they become like your children so you love them all,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The couple also mentor young collectors interested in
African-American art by introducing them to artists and gallery
owners. They continue to donate their art to exhibits to serve as
an educational tool. ``We want young African-Americans to take
pride in their heritage and be an inspiration for other modest
people who want to start an art collection,'' Vivian said.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   She advises aspiring collectors to study art, visit galleries
and museums, and buy art pieces that are appealing and affordable.
Vivian recommends starting small, first by buying signed posters
and lithographs since they are cheap but will gain in value over
time. ``Buy what you love, use your own judgment and instinct. Over
time, your purchases will increase in value,'' she said. ``Anyone
can start collecting. You don't have to be an art expert and you
don't have to have to be rich to collect art.''

<P>
   NEW YORK _ In a cramped, unheated room at ABC No Rio, a
community center on Manhattan's Lower East Side, 10 bundled
volunteers smoke cigarettes and discuss how to save local gardens
from destruction by using the World Wide Web.
</P>
<P>
   They're creating the Interactivist Network Webcasting System
(www.interactivist.net), a Web site participants hope will
revolutionize the way protesters organize, demonstrate and inform.
The site is set to go online in late February. Under a $5,000 grant
from Manhattan Neighborhood Network, a cable company, ABC No Rio
will use photographs, reports, video and discussion boards to
examine one issue at a time, and to show other activists how to do
the same.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are building a news information service that is
nonmediated, where people involved in news events can communicate
with the public,'' said a volunteer, Eric Goldhagen, 33, whose pale
face and scruffy beard give him the look of a cloistered
technophile. ``We are interested in showing the possibilities to
other nonprofits.''
</P>
<P>
   The Interactivists' first project, ``Under the Asphalt,''
highlights a local issue with national ramifications: the sale of
gardens maintained for decades by community groups. The site will
show how protesters and lobbyists can block the auctioning of
garden land by the city. In the future, the site may transmit
rallies and panels on such issues in real time.
</P>
<P>
   Tamra Raven, 30, is donating two one-minute segments to the Web
site, taken from her digital video documentary about community
gardens, ``From Rats to Roses.'' An activist since the age of 5,
Raven said the Internet streamlines the way activists communicate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Group e-mailing has been a powerful, mobilizing tool,'' she
said. ``You can disseminate in a quick way: `Please come to a rally
on June 5.' You can send it to your hundred friends on e-mail, and
they can send it to their hundred friends, and so on.''
</P>
<P>
   Raven is a recent addition to the 20 Web-savvy artists who
started meeting last fall to weigh in on each portion of the site.
In discussing their upcoming ``War on the Homeless'' project,
members decided not to exploit the homeless by showing their faces
on the site.
</P>
<P>
   ABC No Rio members meet at a decaying, four-story tenement at
156 Rivington St., which since 1980 has been home to punk bands,
poets and graphic artists as well as groups like Food Not Bombs,
the Coalition to Free Mumia Abu-Jamal, Act Up and the Rainforest
Activist Network.
</P>
<P>
   For a year, the space has maintained a free computer center,
complete with scanner and laser jet printer. Much of the equipment
was donated or sold at a discount by corporations like the
McGraw-Hill Companies and smaller dealers like Tekserve.
Neighborhood residents use the space a few hours each week to print
resumes, send e-mail to relatives abroad, or write letters to their
landlord.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you want to create a link, you need to fulfill the need of
the people you want to organize,'' Goldhagen said. ``The big issue
is computer and Internet literacy becoming as valuable as being
able to read. If we hope to be a real organization for change, it
starts with making changes in the community.''
</P>
<P>
   The Interactivist Network joins the Web at a time when protester
organization is humming. For example, The Anarchy Organization
(TAO), (www.tao.ca), coordinates through its server a clearinghouse
for web sites by Books to Prisoners Seattle (btp.tao.ca), the
Institute for Social Ecology (www.tao.ca/(tilde)ise) and the
Socialist Forum (http://www.ta.ca/(tilde)socialistforum), among
others. It also supports the Direct Action Media Network
(damn.tao.ca), a multimedia news service that chronicles protests,
marches and strikes.
</P>
<P>
   A reporter for the network, Rachel Rinaldo, 27, said that
stories about protests are often more accurate coming from
independent Web sources than from television networks, which have
time constraints.
</P>
<P>
   Activists used the Internet to organize an estimated 35,000
demonstrators to march on the World Trade Organization meeting in
Seattle last November. And they took a cue from an unlikely source:
big business. Just as companies like Time Warner and America Online
merge, so do groups as disparate as loggers and environmentalists,
who marched side by side to emphasize workers' rights.
</P>
<P>
   The Interactivist Network may continue this trend of
collaboration, said Steven Englander, ABC No Rio's project
director, but more important, it should inspire others to create
their own Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's important to show what happens here, and show what works
and what doesn't,'' Englander said. ``Others can walk away from the
site and learn that lesson. If we are able to pull this off well
with modest means, then any group of people can do this sort of
thing. But you need to get the right team together.''
</P>
<P>
   In that spirit of sharing, the group may produce a how-to
CD-ROM. In the meantime, the volunteers will continue to develop
projects on prison labor, ``workfare,'' parks and housing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We see all these issues interrelated,'' said Goldhager. ``The
policies behind arresting the homeless, profiting from prison
labor. If we just put information online, the connections will be
obvious. We don't have to propagandize, we just inform.''

   NEW YORK _ The waiting room of the St. Vincents Comprehensive
Cancer Center overflowed with patients. With its soft, warm
lighting and sunny yellow and gray decor, it could have easily been
mistaken for the reception area of any office building. But the
hushed, reverent atmosphere of the room had already revealed the
somber mood of the patients as they waited for their examinations.
Most were women with breast cancer. The youngest, Asha
Clayton-Neiderman, was just 24.
</P>
<P>
   Every year breast cancer is diagnosed in 180,000 women,
according to the American Cancer Society. Cases of breast cancer in
women in their 20s are still uncommon; of the 180,000 women, only
1,400, or .8 percent, fall between the ages of 20 and 30 and the
breast cancer rate for women between the ages of 20 and 24 is only
one case in 100,000. But the numbers have been increasing.
</P>
<P>
   A 1999 Breast Cancer Facts and Figures report recently released
by the American Cancer Society said that the number of women under
the age of 40 with breast cancer had been on the rise in the late
1980s and early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Paula Klein, Clayton-Neiderman's oncologist at the St.
Vincents Comprehensive Cancer Center, said she has seen a definite
increase in the number of cases of breast cancer in younger women
in the last few years. ``We're not sure why it's happening,'' she
said, ``but we have definitely seen a rise in the number of young
breast cancer patients we're picking up.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Klein also said that the lack of awareness among young women
was a dangerous problem that could lead to late diagnosis.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is very dramatic for someone Asha's age to have breast
cancer,'' Dr. Klein said of Clayton-Neiderman. ``But many young
women aren't as tuned in to this as they should be. No one ever
includes women in their 20s when discussing breast cancer victims
so they never hear about it.''
</P>
<P>
   In general, women in their 20s are not at a high risk for
developing breast cancer unless they have certain risk factors in
their medical history. For patients such as Clayton-Neiderman, a
family history of cancer was probably a key factor. Her paternal
grandmother's cancer was diagnosed at the age of 81; her paternal
aunt's diagnosis came at the age of 30. Tests will be conducted to
determine whether Clayton-Neiderman carries the gene for breast
cancer. If so, she faces the risk of developing ovarian cancer as
well.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since ovarian cancer is harder to detect than breast cancer,
if I have the gene,'' Clayton-Neiderman said, the doctors ``will
want to remove my ovaries just to be safe. I always imagined a life
for myself with lots of children but now I kind of can't plan
anymore. Things I want have changed.''
</P>
<P>
   Clayton-Neiderman first discovered a lump in her left breast
when conducting a routine self-examination in May 1999. Ever the
optimist, she refused to believe that anything was wrong. Assuming
that the abnormality was a routine cyst, Clayton-Neiderman put off
her visit to the doctor despite her family history of breast
cancer. After repeated urging by her mother, Clayton-Neiderman went
in for a mammogram only to be told that the breast tissue was too
dense and nothing could be seen. Doctors recommended an ultrasound
of her left breast. In November, she underwent the test with little
concern only to discover that the results were not good.
</P>
<P>
   ``They came in and said, `Asha, it's cancerous,''' she recalled.
``It didn't register at all. I grabbed my head and just started
crying. I did that for about 10 seconds before I collected myself.
And then I realized that there was nothing I could do about it so
crying wasn't going to help.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead of tears, Clayton-Neiderman threw a hair-cutting party.
``I knew I was going to lose my hair and be self-conscious,'' she
said. ``I was losing control so the party was a way to get it back.
I wanted my friends to be involved in the process.''
</P>
<P>
   Friends gathered at her Manhattan apartment in early January,
armed with pink ribbons and shears to crop Clayton-Neiderman's
long, black hair. The pink ribbons, symbolic of breast cancer
awareness, were tied to locks of her hair before they were cut off
by each of her friends. The guests were given a lock after the
party as a reminder of how Clayton-Neiderman looked before the
chemotherapy had a chance to ravage her body, as well as a symbol
of awareness.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone Asha talks to, she leaves an impact on,'' said Dr.
Klein. ``More and more young women are hearing about this through
family and friends that have gone through or are going through the
experience. Awareness is the key.''
</P>
<P>
   After the diagnosis, Clayton-Neiderman became determined to get
the word out on breast cancer. And the word is spreading. Recently
a high school friend of Clayton-Neiderman's, Tony Texeira,
organized a fund-raiser in her hometown, Boston. Four hundred
guests donated money in Clayton-Neiderman's name to the American
Cancer Society. An estimated $10,000 was raised at the event, an
amount that went beyond Clayton-Neiderman's expectations and
bolstered her spirits.
</P>
<P>
   Her present and future are now scheduled around her medical
treatments. She will undergo four treatments of chemotherapy, once
every three weeks, followed by radiation therapy every day for two
months. For the next five years, she will have to take the
prescription drug Tamoxofin every day. Even with the treatment,
there is a high chance of the cancerous tumor returning.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tumors tend to be more aggressive in younger patients and
they've got a long time in which it can come back,'' Dr. Klein
explained. ``In Asha's case, she has a very aggressive looking
tumor.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Clayton-Neiderman has maintained a sense of humor.
</P>
<P>
   ``So many people were calling me to see how I was that my friend
Liz and I came up with a new answering machine message,'' she
recalled, laughing. ``If you want to know what happened to Asha,
press 1; if you want to know her treatment plan, press 2; if you
want to know how Asha's feeling, press 3.''
</P>
<P>
   Clayton-Neiderman may be able to find the humor in her situation
but there is no mistaking how seriously she takes her experience
with breast cancer. ``People always feel bad for me but I think
things happen for a reason and they make you stronger. The cancer
is part of my life and while I wouldn't choose it, I certainly
wouldn't trade it.''

 &HT;     McCAIN GAINS ON BUSH IN CALIFORNIA PRIMARY  
 &HT;     (Eds: Complete writethru _ adds poll figures, edits to tighten)
 &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By ROBERT SALLADAY  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Texas Gov. George W. Bush retains his
comfortable lead over Sen. John McCain in the California primary
jackpot, but a new survey shows the Arizona senator is gaining more
Republican converts as the two presidential hopefuls fight for the
soul of their party.
</P>
<P>
   The poll also showed Vice President Al Gore beating former New
Jersey Sen. Bill Bradley in the Democratic primary. Bradley's
message that Gore is too conservative apparently has not impressed
increasingly wealthy and older California voters.
</P>
<P>
   The survey was conducted for the San Francisco Examiner and
KTVU-TV by the Research 2000 polling organization in Rockville, Md.
Both the Democratic and Republican primaries are March 7.
</P>
<P>
   Although he has made big gains in California, McCain's challenge
remains large. The poll showed that Bush still leads McCain among
all voters and, crucially, would beat him by an 11-point margin
among rank-and-file Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   California's primary system allows voters to cross party lines,
so McCain is courting Democrats and independents as he has done in
other states. But in California, registered Republicans are the
only ones who count in selecting delegates to the national
convention this summer in Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   McCain is gaining ground. According to Examiner/KTVU poll taken
last month, Bush was favored over McCain by 26 percent to 12
percent among all voters surveyed. Among Republicans, it was 49 to
16.
</P>
<P>
   In the latest poll, released Sunday, the margin narrowed to 28
percent for Bush to 24 percent for McCain among all voters, while
Bush led McCain 41 to 30 among Republicans. Twenty-eight percent
said they were undecided.
</P>
<P>
   The poll, which has a margin of error of plus or minus 3.5
percentage points, was conducted Feb. 21 through 23 among 803
Californians who say they regularly vote. Among Republican voters
only, the margin of error is 6 percentage points because the sample
size is smaller.
</P>
<P>
   The numbers show California could provide this unconventional
campaign with another shocker. Democratic voters who believe Gore
is the sure winner, as the polls show, could defect during the
primary and vote for McCain in large numbers. McCain could win the
beauty contest among all California voters, while Bush could get
the GOP votes and all 162 delegates for the nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Bush supporters and advisers don't buy the split-decision
argument.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a great, fun diversion,'' said state Sen. Jim Brulte,
a Republican from Rancho Cucamonga, ``but I think the one who gets
the most Republican votes is also going to be the one who is the
first vote-getter in California, and I expect that to be George W.
Bush.''
</P>
<P>
   When the poll was taken, McCain was coming off a stinging defeat
in South Carolina, then surging with an important win in Michigan
and Arizona. So the survey results could show an unrealistic
``bounce'' in favor of McCain, said the Research 2000 pollster, Del
Ali.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the poll shows GOP voters statewide are
increasingly split between McCain and Bush, who only weeks ago was
perceived as the anointed nominee. While rank-and-file Republicans
favor Bush by wider margins, McCain is attracting a healthy number
of Democrats and a huge number of independent voters _ the same
scenario that gave him victories in the Michigan and New Hampshire
primaries.
</P>
<P>
   The poll shows that McCain, however, suffers from a gender gap.
Women voters are more likely to pick Bush than McCain if they are
voting for a Republican. Gore does the best among women voters
overall, followed by Bush. Among ethnic groups, McCain doesn't
appear to have suffered from his use of the word ``gook'' to
describe his captors during the Vietnam War. He gets just about the
same amount of support from Asian voters as Bradley and Gore in
one-on-one matchups.
</P>
<P>
   With Republicans only 35 percent of the voting electorate in
California, Bush acknowledges he will have to reach out to
Democrats and others during the general election. But right now his
fight is for Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   ``My focus is on GOP delegates,'' Bush said. ``If I were
cruising along and winning every primary, it would be one thing.
But I'm in a battle. I've won some and I've lost some. ... There is
going to be ample time to set the tone for the general election
between when the nomination is secure and when people start paying
attention to general election politics.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain has sought to broaden his message, alluding to Ronald
Reagan's appeal to conservative Democrats and union members.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're putting the Reagan coalition back together,'' said Dan
Schnur, McCain's communications director. ``Independents and swing
Democrats have been crossing over to vote for John McCain because
they want to get the special interests out of government. They've
been hearing his message of reform.''
</P>
<P>
   Part of the Republican fight is over who could beat Gore, the
presumed Democratic nominee, in the November general election. The
Examiner/KTVU poll shows Bush losing to Gore by 7 percentage points
and he is statistically tied with Bradley. McCain is virtually tied
with Gore and beats Bradley by 5 points.

EMERSON QUARTER MAKES THEATER OF SHOSTAKOVICH  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By JAMES R. OESTREICH   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ When you've played all 15 Shostakovich string
quartets in five programs over three weeks at Alice Tully Hall,
what do you do for an encore? If you're the Emerson String Quartet
(which has also recorded the works in a fine new release from
Deutsche Grammophon), you play the 15th Quartet all over again and
build an intricate theatrical program around it.
</P>
<P>
   So, beginning Tuesday night, the Emerson is to take part in a
most unusual collaboration, ``The Noise of Time,'' a production by
the Theatre de Complicite conceived and directed by Simon McBurney,
the company's artistic director. Six performances are to be
presented through Sunday at the John Jay College Theater near
Lincoln Center.
</P>
<P>
   Not that this crowning touch was in any sense an afterthought.
The concert series itself grew out of a more ambitious notion
hatched four years ago by Philip Setzer, one of the Emerson's
violinists and its chief idea man. Setzer began with the vague
thought that it might be interesting to present all 15 Shostakovich
quartets in a theatrical treatment, with the Emerson in some sense
acting, or at least dramatizing the music. So he approached Jane S.
Moss, vice president for programming at Lincoln Center, to explore
the possibility of doing so in the Great Performers series.
</P>
<P>
   ``We took the idea and ran with it,'' Moss said. Well, walked.
At the time, she was just giving shape to an idea of her own, New
Visions, a series intended to bring other dimensions _ most notably
the visual and the theatrical _ to bear on the presentation of
classical music. She sensed potential in Setzer's concept but knew
it would take time to develop, and other projects were closer at
hand.
</P>
<P>
   So she first dispatched the Emerson on another compleatist
venture, playing all 16 Beethoven string quartets, interspersed
with works from the 20th century, in eight concerts over two
seasons. She enlisted McBurney and his brother, Gerard, a composer,
teacher, writer and broadcaster with a consuming interest in
Shostakovich, to refine the original idea.
</P>
<P>
   The Theatre de Complicite, a cutting-edge theatrical company
based in London, is best known in New York for its dramatic work at
the Lincoln Center Festival: ``Three Lives of Lucie Chabrol'' in
1996 and ``The Street of Crocodiles'' in 1998. McBurney also
directed ``The Chairs'' on Broadway in 1998. But Moss said that the
main reason she chose McBurney for the project may have been his
affinity for music.
</P>
<P>
   ``Acting at its best is a musical profession,'' he said
recently. ``When you act onstage, the musical function is almost
more dominant than the emotional one. On film, an actor can call up
`real' events and relive them. You can't do that night after night
onstage. It's too draining. You deal with fake emotions based on
musical principles: rhythm, tempo, harmonies, upbeats, downbeats.''
</P>
<P>
   The parties ultimately deemed it best to limit the theatrical
aspect to a single work, a decision for which all must be grateful
now that it is clear how much intensive effort goes into such a
production, at least a McBurney production. Yet exactly what form
this production has taken is by no means clear, even to one who saw
part of it in rehearsal and heard the rest extensively discussed
around a table of drinks with the Emerson players and the
McBurneys: extensively but guardedly, especially on the part of
Simon McBurney.
</P>
<P>
   The second half, the part rehearsed, is a performance of the
work by the quartet, straightforward in audio terms. But visually,
the performance becomes a spectacle. The Emerson members roam about
the stage while playing, tethered, more or less, to scores and
working around an array of chairs left from the earlier drama.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   The first half of the production, kept more mysterious, uses
four actors and draws on documentary and archival material in a
multimedia presentation. ``It is not a reading, not a play,''
McBurney said. ``No one is pretending to be Shostakovich. Instead,
we are attempting to meditate on him, understanding that the `him'
will be present in the 15th quartet.''
</P>
<P>
   Many commentators agree that Shostakovich is indeed present in
this quartet, perhaps more than in any other except the Eighth,
which bears his explicit musical signature throughout. He wrote the
15th in a hospital in 1974, the year before his death. Remarkably,
its six movements, totaling about 35 minutes, are all in the same
key, E flat minor, and all marked ``adagio'': a slowness heightened
to ``adagio molto'' in the fifth movement (``Funeral March'') and
part of the sixth (``Epilogue'').
</P>
<P>
   ``The bleak introspection and elegiac cast of its unprecedented
succession of six adagio movements left no doubt in his
contemporaries' minds that the String Quartet No. 15 ... could be
regarded as a personal requiem,'' Laurel E. Fay writes in her new
biography of the composer. (The work's nearest precedent, in terms
of sheer sustained slowness, may be Haydn's ``Seven Last Words of
Christ,'' where the meaning is less personal.)
</P>
<P>
   Shostakovich spoke of the 15th Quartet in typically sardonic and
paradoxical terms. ``Play it so that flies drop dead in midair and
the audience starts leaving the hall from sheer boredom,'' he
suggested once. ``The first movement is a novella, the second a
scherzo, and the finale is an adagio in memory of Beethoven; but
don't let that inhibit you. The music is bright, bright and
clear.''
</P>
<P>
   Simon McBurney takes his cue from the music. ``It is partly
about memory,'' he said of his production. ``Shostakovich
remembering. Others remembering him.'' Voices and music are to be
heard, drawn from hours of archival audio material. The actors will
evidently move within a shifting context of props and projections.
The performance of the Emerson is to emerge seamlessly from the
theatrical segment and carry it through. The players _ Setzer and
Eugene Drucker, violinists; Lawrence Dutton, violist; and David
Finckel, cellist _ enter from the rear, wearing midcentury
Soviet-style suits, and move forward as they play.
</P>
<P>
   At the rehearsal, which started with the second movement,
Finckel was seated on a platform amid the sea of chairs. Setzer and
Dutton were at either side, and Drucker brought up the rear. As the
performance progressed, this circle narrowed, player by player at
varying speeds, until they were all seated on the platform with
Finckel. McBurney interrupted repeatedly to choreograph footsteps
and bow strokes, incorporating suggestions from the actors.
</P>
<P>
   To judge from what was seen or, in the absence of stage lighting
and machinery, otherwise gleaned, the platform will gradually move
to the front of the stage, and the players (including Finckel) will
rise while still playing, seeming to crowd right onto listeners'
consciousness. The lights will be doused at the end, a sure-fire
theatrical effect.
</P>
<P>
   ``At least that's the way it is now,'' Finckel said in
good-natured exasperation. ``It changes every day.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes,'' Gerard McBurney chimed in. ``The very fact that you've
been told of this means that it will all be changed.''
</P>
<P>
   Simon McBurney, who is notoriously leery of letting people see
his work in progress, evidently felt vindicated by expressions of
puzzlement directed at him. ``That's what happens,'' he said. ``You
come here perplexed, you don't know what you're looking at, and you
go away more perplexed.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What we want is to give listeners a dynamic experience, to
give people the experience of listening in a different way,'' he
added. ``We have no preconceptions about which way they should hear
it. There are many ways. Avenues will be opened because of a series
of shocks that we give.''
</P>
<P>
   Finckel's little joke aside, the Emerson players profess to be
sold on the project and on the experience of working with McBurney
and the actors, concentrating intensively on body language if not
quite dance.
</P>
<P>
   ``The experience is affecting the way we play the piece and all
pieces,'' Finckel said. ``It gives us a different level of
awareness and makes us conscious of every movement. It's easy to
become self-absorbed in the experience of performing. This helps us
to be aware of crossing the footlights, to realize that people are
affected by everything that happens onstage, the way we hold
ourselves, even the way we hold our bows.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps McBurney should be turned loose on the many orchestral
players who seem unaware that they communicate from the stage with
their every gesture, for ill as well as good. But now, seeming
frayed and preoccupied, he had to rush off and sort through the
makings of the multimedia portion of the show, which he referred to
as ``the mess on my floor.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Every once in a while, even now,'' he said, ``I get the
feeling that I should just have my brother get up on the stage and
say a few words about the music and leave it at that.''

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ When the chairman of the Nasdaq stock market visited
Israel recently, he was not a traveling salesman drumming up
business. He was more like a potentate inspecting the outer realms
of a fast-expanding empire.
</P>
<P>
   As the chairman, Frank G. Zarb, reminded his hosts at every
opportunity, nearly as many shares in Israeli stocks are traded on
his computerized exchange as on the Tel Aviv stock market itself.
There are more companies on Nasdaq from Israel _ 91 _ than from any
other country outside North America, and Nasdaq lists more Israeli
companies than all other foreign bourses combined. And most of them
are not traded in Israel at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``Capital has no passport,'' said Zarb, chairman of the National
Association of Securities Dealers, Nasdaq's owner, during a two-day
visit in mid-February, when he was received like royalty by the
prime minister, the finance minister and high-technology business
leaders.
</P>
<P>
   But Israeli securities dealers worry that high-technology
investment capital does carry a passport _ a U.S. passport. And
they fear that Nasdaq's Israeli portfolio could soon eclipse the
entire Tel Aviv Stock Exchange, both in sheer size and growth
prospects, relegating the local market to sluggish, traditional
state-dominated industries.
</P>
<P>
   The only alternative, they say, is to authorize automatic
listings in Tel Aviv for Israeli companies traded on Nasdaq and
other U.S. markets, a proposal resisted by government regulators.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unless Israeli companies listed abroad can also be listed
here, the Tel Aviv exchange has no future,'' one exchange official
said.
</P>
<P>
   The 78 Israeli companies that are now listed only on Nasdaq
include the country's highest-flying technology dynamos, led by
Check Point Software Technologies, a 7-year-old Internet security
specialist, now capitalized at about $14 billion. That is three
times the size of Bezeq, the national telephone company, which has
long been the biggest industrial company traded solely in Tel Aviv.
</P>
<P>
   Approaching Bezeq in capitalization are several other
Nasdaq-only Israeli companies, like Gilat Satellite Systems, valued
at $3.6 billion, and ECI Telecom, at $3.1 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Seemingly unstoppable trends indicate that Nasdaq's Israeli
companies, worth an aggregate $67 billion at the beginning of
February, will soon surpass the Tel Aviv market's 669 listed
companies, valued collectively at about $75 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Thirteen older Israeli companies are listed on both Nasdaq and
in Tel Aviv, most notably Teva Pharmaceutical Industries, a generic
drug manufacturer that is the current Israeli market leader, with a
value of about $4.85 billion. But most high-technology start-ups
seeking riches from initial public offerings jump directly to
Nasdaq and do not look back.
</P>
<P>
   ``We understand why they would want to do an IPO on Nasdaq,
considering the valuation they could get, but we also want to see
them listed here,'' said Yair Ogler, chairman of the Tel Aviv Stock
Exchange.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Ogler says Tel Aviv cannot compete with the giant American
exchange, where a billion shares are often traded daily.
</P>
<P>
   The Tel Aviv 100 market index jumped a record 62 percent in
1999. But the Nasdaq 100 soared 102 percent, fueled by upstart
companies with the coveted Internet software offerings and wireless
data technologies in which Israel increasingly specializes.
</P>
<P>
   Last year alone, Nasdaq reports, Israeli companies raised $729
million through initial public offerings there. The most successful
was Partner Communications, Israel's third-place cellular phone
company, which took in $263 million. Since 1995, according to
Nasdaq figures, Israeli companies have collected $1.7 billion
through new Nasdaq stock offerings and another $1.4 billion through
secondary offerings.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Israeli high-tech revolution has combined with an
unprecedented boom on Wall Street to create a feeling among local
market leaders that unless they act soon, they will wake up one day
to find that Israel's stock market has fled to America,'' Guy
Rolnik, a financial commentator for the daily newspaper Haaretz,
noted in his column.
</P>
<P>
   For at least seven years, Ogler says, market executives have
tried to persuade authorities that any Israeli-owned public company
satisfying the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's reporting
requirements should automatically qualify for a spot in Tel Aviv.
</P>
<P>
   But securities regulators here find fault with the SEC's more
lenient rules for foreign companies, which file 20F financial
statements, instead of the more thorough 10K forms demanded of
companies incorporated in the United States. In addition, they
contend, Israel is more stringent than the SEC in reporting trades
by major stockholders, and companies registered only in Tel Aviv
could be penalized by a double standard.
</P>
<P>
   The problem, Ogler and others respond, is that successful Nasdaq
companies like Check Point say they have no interest in registering
shares in Tel Aviv if it requires preparing different and demanding
financial and legal documents.
</P>
<P>
   Nasdaq would welcome dual listings with the Israeli exchange,
Zarb said here. ``We encourage it,'' he said. ``It will help Tel
Aviv, and in the long run it is good for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Zarb's visit appears to have galvanized the government into
action. Two days after he left, Finance Minister Avraham Shohat
called industry executives and regulators into his office and gave
them two weeks to help his deputies prepare a new proposal for dual
share listings.
</P>
<P>
   The Finance Ministry team responded with detailed
recommendations for new rules that they say would make the local
registry of Israeli Nasdaq stocks virtually automatic.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Ehud Barak also spoke in favor of a dual system,
announcing that he and Zarb had ``agreed to establish joint
professional teams to examine ways for the state of Israel and
Nasdaq to cooperate and deepen relations.''

GOP LEADERS ATTACK McCAIN AS HE FORGES NEW GROUND 
 
By GREG McDONALD 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In Cleveland last week an angry woman shoved a
leaflet at a young man suggesting that John McCain would not
protect the rights of the unborn.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're trying to do everything they can to stop him _ even
lies,'' the woman, a McCain supporter, told him.
</P>
<P>
   The leaflet bears the image of a baby and criticized McCain, a
senator from Arizona, for approving fetal tissue research in an
effort to portray Texas Gov. George W. Bush as the only
anti-abortion candidate.
</P>
<P>
   ``This little guy wants you to vote for George W. Bush,'' the
leaflet said, referring to the baby.
</P>
<P>
   But McCain and Bush oppose abortion except in cases of rape or
incest or if the life of the mother is endangered.
</P>
<P>
   The leaflet is an example of some of the tactics being used by
Republican leaders and their allies in special interest groups that
are opposed to campaign-finance reform and other issues McCain has
championed.
</P>
<P>
   The leaflet circulating against McCain in Ohio is the same one
that was distributed by the National Right to Life Committee in
South Carolina to help Bush win the Republican presidential primary
there.
</P>
<P>
   California Assemblywoman Marilyn Brewer told reporters that
party leaders in her state would risk tearing the Republican Party
apart just to deny McCain the nomination.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're scared to death of change. ... He's forging new
ground. He's changing the party, and a lot of people are afraid of
it,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   She said they also ``hate'' the idea that McCain, if elected in
the fall, would use his White House bully pulpit to promote
campaign-finance reform, which would effectively end the unbridled
raising and expenditure of special interest ``soft money,'' which
most often is used to distort the positions of a candidate.
</P>
<P>
   ``John McCain is literally reforming and remaking the Republican
Party with his campaign,'' Brewer said.
</P>
<P>
   Brewer said the anti-McCain ``rumor mill'' is already working
overtime in California putting out ``negative stuff'' about the
senator's personal life, his voting record and his position on
issues ranging from abortion to taxes.
</P>
<P>
   The same thing happened in South Carolina, which Bush won by 11
points Feb. 19. Republican and Christian leaders helped Bush by
using everything from anti-abortion leaflets to press releases
portraying McCain as a supporter of gay lifestyles as evidence that
McCain is not a true conservative.
</P>
<P>
   McCain said he does not approve of gay lifestyles, but he and
Bush agree on the Clinton administration's ``don't ask, don't
tell'' policy on gays in the military. But unlike Bush, McCain has
spoken out about discrimination against gays and has met with the
Log Cabin Republicans, the GOP's largest gay organization. Bush has
refused to meet with them.
</P>
<P>
   Republican televangelist Pat Robertson recorded a telephone
message to thousands accusing McCain of being allied with
``vicious'' anti-Christian bigots; a Republican professor at Bob
Jones University sent out e-mails with an unsubstantiated rumor
about McCain's personal life; and other e-mails criticized McCain
for adopting a Bangladeshi daughter.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush campaign at first denied any connection with the smear
effort. But Sunday, Bush adviser Karl Rove acknowledged that the
Texas governor's campaign had paid for some of Robertson's
telephone calls, which are also being used now in Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   Rove complained that Bush has also been ``on the receiving end
of all kinds of ugly'' ad campaigns aimed at trashing the
governor's record.
</P>
<P>
   Those efforts included one that the McCain campaign at first
denied, then acknowledged, supporting: a phone campaign that
suggested Bush was an anti-Catholic bigot for not repudiating the
policies of Bob Jones University and the prejudices of its founder.
</P>
<P>
   The heat generated by that attack compelled Bush to issue a
blanket apology to Catholics on Sunday for the ``missed
opportunity'' to disassociate himself from the school's attitudes
when he campaigned there earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
   And a McCain supporter, South Carolina Speaker Pro Tempore Terry
Haskins, resigned Monday from the Arizona senator's state campaign,
saying he was offended that both Bush and McCain were using
religious beliefs as political props.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the outrage expressed by McCain supporters and aides,
Republican pollster Frank Luntz, a close ally of House Majority
Whip Tom DeLay, R-Texas, and other GOP congressional leaders, said
the negative effort directed at the senator ``is just how politics
is played in this country.''
</P>
<P>
   Luntz said what Republicans leaders really resent is that McCain
has hit on a successful campaign formula that has alluded them in
the last two congressional races. If they don't adopt ``McCain's
campaign style,'' as he put it, the GOP could end up losing control
of Congress in November.
</P>
<P>
   The formula, he said, is pretty simple. Instead of preaching the
conservative party line, McCain is reaching out to all voters with
a message of tolerance for all views. In many ways, his message is
similar to the ``compassionate'' big tent Republicanism that Bush
preaches.
</P>
<P>
   Luntz said McCain's history of bucking his own party on
campaign-finance reform and budget matters has also helped him. But
he said the senator's promise to always tell Americans ``the truth,
no matter what'' is the magnet that's drawing new independent and
crossover Democratic voters to the party.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's refreshing, and it's what Americans are looking for,''
said Luntz, who used to promote Bush as the best hope for
Republicans winning the White House again.
</P>
<P>
   Luntz spent the weekend at a Republican leadership retreat,
where he urged House members to adopt McCain's campaign style in
the fall elections.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I tell Republicans is ... learn from John McCain's style
even if you disagree with him on the issues,'' Luntz said. ``What
he's doing has consequences for the party. If nothing else, we
should learn from his style and the way he reaches out to voters.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain aide Mark Salter agrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``McCain has shown them how to keep their majority in Congress.
It'll be interesting to see whether or not they get the message.''

   &UR; A FINE FEATHERED FIESTA OF POETIC LICENSE &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Announcement of a San Francisco party last week for 6,500, ``a
magazine of poetry, fiction and pictures of men and women in
sweatshirts,'' said 6,500 pigeons would be released into the
auditorium of New College of California,to ``swoop, coo and eat
pinto beans during a poetry reading.'' Afterward, said the
announcement, a pigeon wrangler would use a giant net to remove the
birds from the hall.
</P>
<P>
   Said editor  &UR; Katie Degentesh &LR; , ``Pigeons and poetry are two
images of the same thing: the desire to move freely in three
dimensions while living in a place with lots of people.''
</P>
<P>
   In keeping with the ``fiction'' aspect of the journal, the
pigeon release didn't exactly occur. Organizers decided, poet
 &UR; Paul LaFarge &LR;  told Personals, that ``Pigeons are already free'' and
``there was nothing poets could do but make them freer.'' They used
a parrot instead, which LaFarge says ``sat freely'' on the finger
of Degentesh, who owns it. ``We didn't release the parrot, but we
did read poetry to it,'' said LaFarge.
</P>
<P>
   Did the parrot enjoy the poetry? ``Who can be sure,'' asked
LaFarge, realizing the limits of human comprehension, ``what a
parrot feels?''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; GERMANS CASH IN ON AUSTRIAN POLITICS &LR;
</P>
<P>
   A German company selling ski trips in the United States ran
full-page newspaper ads recently picturing rightist Austrian leader
 &UR; Jorg Haider &LR; . The ad line, as quoted in Advertising Age: ``For all
those who now don't want to go on a skiing holiday in Austria.''
</P>
<P>
   Haider never gave permission for his photo to be used, and
 &UR; Peter Westenthaler &LR;  of his Austrian Freedom Party, told Ad Age that
the case is in the hands of a party lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   The company that placed the ad, tiss.com, told the magazine that
it is still arranging for trips to and from Austria, and the ad was
a ``nod to current events'' rather than an attack on Austrians.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A SAD TALE OF MOTHERS AND PUBLISHING &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Bob Blauner &LR; , who was a professor of sociology at UC Berkeley
for 30 years, sold his first nonacademic book to the famously hot
editor  &UR; Judith Regan &LR; , whose hit parade had included books by
 &UR; Howard Stern &LR; ,  &UR; Rush Limbaugh &LR;  and  &UR; Kathie Lee Gifford &LR; .
ReganBooks, an imprint of HarperCollins, was to publish ``Our
Mothers' Spirits,'' an anthology of writings ``on the death of
mothers and the grief of men,'' in February 1998.
</P>
<P>
   But that fall,  &UR; Princess Diana  &LR; died, writes Blauner in the
current issue of Brill's Content, so Regan and her minions pushed
up the publication date to November 1, asked him to write a preface
focused on the princess and slapped a picture of Diana and her two
sons on the cover.
</P>
<P>
   The cover ``was a completely vulgar display,'' writes Blauner
and ``one that shamelessly exploited Diana and her sons.'' He tried
to fight it and lost.
</P>
<P>
   Time magazine put the book on the ``DiPloitation Watch,'' and
Entertainment Weekly reported that Barnes &AMP; Noble and Borders found
it so offensive that they were questioning whether to stock the
book. (They did.)
</P>
<P>
   After what Blauner describes as a ``near-boycott of my book,''
fewer than 3,000 copies sold. Regan, whom Blauner accuses of
masterminding the Di debacle, chose not to comment to Brill's
Content.

`A JOYFUL NOISE': HANDEL'S HOLY WORK, BORN OF SCANDAL  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Calif.)   By ANTHONY TOMMASINI   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ There is a great story behind the creation of
Handel's ``Messiah.'' The London premiere of the work was nearly
sabotaged by the vehement opposition of the church, political
conspiracies, dueling divas and a sex scandal. Handel is a great
story unto himself, this stout, imperious, German musical genius
and savvy theatrical entrepreneur who settled in London and had a
long streak of success writing exotic Italian operas for an
enthralled English public, until tastes changed and the composer
panicked.
</P>
<P>
   The playwright Tim Slover thought that the true background tale
of this iconic oratorio might make a nifty play. The result is ``A
Joyful Noise,'' which had its premiere late last year at the Lamb's
Players Theater, a San Diego-based performing arts organization.
That production, with one cast change, has come to the Lamb's
Theater on West 44th Street. Though the inherent story is
fascinating, ``A Joyful Noise'' is a contrived play, directed by
Robert Smyth with no apparent consistency of style. The actors
engage in all manner of overly broad physical comedy and
boisterously loud delivery of the text.
</P>
<P>
   It's unfortunate, because Slover has done his homework. Many
facts about the premiere are in dispute, but those that are known
the playwright has utilized faithfully. The situation as presented
is essentially correct.
</P>
<P>
   In 1741, Handel, then 56, was in debt and in crisis. His royal
patron and ardent admirer, Queen Caroline, the wife of King George
II of the House of Hanover, had died in 1737. His Italian operas
were losing popularity. He was suffering from the aftermath of a
partial stroke. In the summer of 1741, Charles Jennens, a wealthy
squire and music connoisseur, who had written the libretto for
Handel's oratorio ``Saul,'' sent him a new script. It had no
characters; it simply told the story of the Messiah using biblical
scripture compiled by Jennens. At first Handel was baffled by it.
But when a performance opportunity arose in Dublin, he composed a
score in three weeks.
</P>
<P>
   All the characters in Slover's play are based on historical
people, and they are quite a gallery. Susannah Cibber (performed by
Mary Miller), was a singer and actress who had married the
co-manager of the Drury Lane Theater to assist the flagging career
of her brother, the composer Thomas Arne. She was ruined by her
part in an adultery scandal, the salacious details of which were
circulated in a best-selling book at the time, the Starr report of
its day, as Slover has called it. The play includes quotes from the
book and the trial transcript. The Dublin and London premieres of
the ``Messiah'' were Cibber's comeback.
</P>
<P>
   Her nemesis was Kitty Clive (Deborah Gilmour Smyth), a popular
comic actress whose robust soprano voice enticed Handel to use her
in ``The Messiah.'' A humorless, self-inflated Jennens (Paul
Eggington), the German-born King George (Smyth), Mary Pendarves
(Linda Bush), an eccentric art patron loyal to Handel, and other
historical characters are also here, but in preposterous
stereotypes. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If Slover's aim was to render the story as a compelling comic
drama in the manner of Peter Shaffer's ``Amadeus,'' it doesn't
work. Handel could be imperious and peremptory in his treatment of
singers and servants, but he was a good-humored, self-possessed
fellow and his sallies were apparently of the stinging-wit sort.
Here Handel is portrayed by the portly Tom Stephenson as a
bellowing, manic hothead, a wigged 18th-century John Belushi. What
passes for his wit is pretty lame: ``Madam, I never make sport,''
he tells Kitty Clive, ``I am German.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the intimate size of the theater, almost all of the
actors shout their lines hysterically, with the exception of Smyth,
the director, who brings some restraint to the role of King George.
Why didn't he exert some control over his cast? Doren Elias, as
Handel's copyist and treasurer John Christopher Smith, apparently
thinks that screaming his lines in an exaggerated English accent is
terribly British and utterly hilarious.
</P>
<P>
   David Thayer's simple unit set and lighting and Jeanne Reith's
period costumes work well. Excerpts from Handel's music, some
played on tape, some sung by Miller and Smyth, and culminating in a
performance of the ``Hallelujah'' chorus by the entire cast, though
not exactly elegant, provide welcome relief from the aggressive
comedy of the play and the production.

</P>
<P>
   ``ROBIN HOOD WAS RIGHT'' &QL; 
By Chuck Collins and Pam Rogers (Norton, $28.95) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Wait! Don't mail those checks yet. Collins and Rogers have
advice about charitable giving that will help you donate your money
with thought and purpose rather than with guilt and self-interest.
Americans gave $109 billion to charity last year, yet one in four
top earners gave nothing, the wealthy gave smaller portions of
their assets than did the poor, and only 13 percent of the money
went to direct public benefit through human service programs (most
went to churches, the arts, elite private universities and
hospitals). Here, the authors attempt to redefine modern
philanthropy in order to affect change _ instead of focusing on the
immediate symptoms of social or economic problems, they want our
dollars to chip away at the CAUSES of those problems. Collins and
Rogers are dedicated, energetic, knowledgeable and frankly, a bit
daunting in their zeal. But you'll learn something if you listen to
them. As Alfre Woodard writes in her preface, ``Robin Hood was
right. And he had a damn good time.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
``HAWKE'S COVE'' &QL; 
By Susan Wilson (Pocket, $23.95) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Here's one for the ``Bridges of Madison County'' crowd, another
novel that attempts to parlay yearning and denial into a bad but
bittersweet bestseller. A young journal-keeping woman named Vangie
retreats to her grandmother's farm in a small coastal town (note
the title) to recover from the death of her baby and to wait for
news of her husband, who is overseas fighting in World War II. It's
not long before a down-on-his-luck stranger named Joe shows up, and
we know what that means. Vangie hires him to work on the farm, they
drink tea and lemonade, they watch each other through lowered
lashes, they swim (``There is,'' Wilson writes, ``a strange
intimacy in swimming . . .''), she spreads ointment on his
blistered hands. When Vangie's husband is declared missing in
action, she and Joe have a hot night together in the hayloft, but
word comes the very next morning that the husband is still alive.
Denial commences. Years pass. Violins play. Their children grow up
and get nosey. Have you been here before? You betcha. &QL; 
 &QL; 
``FOREVER LIESL'' &QL; 
By Charmian Carr (Viking, $23.95) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   We were hoping to find some dirt here, but according to Carr,
there was precious little of it on the set of ``The Sound of
Music.'' Until now, the only relief from the unrelenting sweetness
of the film was an anecdote about Christopher Plummer, who played
Baron von Trapp and who allegedly hated the movie so much he called
it ``The Sound of Mucus.'' But Carr, who played the von Trapp
daughter Liesl, debunks that story, saying that Plummer himself
denies it (he did despise the song ``Edelweiss'' and tried to have
it tossed from the film). Mostly, this book is a cheerful report on
a cheerful experience, with some funny moments on the side. When
she attended the Mexican premiere (the film was called ``La Novicia
Rebelde,'' or ``The Rebellious Novice''), the unsuspecting Carr was
taken to a bullfight. The matador dedicated the bull to her, and
she watched in horror as the bull was tormented by the matador and
the matador was then run over by the bull. She visited the matador
in the hospital, as Liesl certainly would have done if she'd been
there. &QL; 
 &QL; 
``THE VISION OF EMMA BLAU'' &QL; 
By Ursula Hegi (Simon &AMP; Schuster, $25) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Hegi's new novel is a family saga that begins in the early
1900s, when scrappy teenager Stefan Blau comes to America from
Germany (specifically from Burgdorf, which figures into Hegi's
earlier books, ``Stones From the River'' and ``Floating in My
Mother's Palm''), and sets out to make his fortune. After a fire in
the New York restaurant where he works, he leaves the city and goes
to a small town in New Hampshire because a fellow immigrant has
told him it reminded him of Germany. There, Stefan marries twice
and loses both wives to the births of his children before he
returns to Burgdorf to bring back and marry Helene Montag, his
childhood friend and the character through which Hegi explores the
difficult adjustment of the German immigrant. Serving as a backdrop
for the story is the Wasserburg, the grand and glorious apartment
building that Stefan builds, which reflects the fortunes of his
family. Hegi's characterization is superb, part of a story that is
as well-constructed as the Wasserburg itself.  &QL;

Rogers are dedicated, energetic, knowledgeable and frankly, a bit
daunting in their zeal. But you'll learn something if you listen to
them. As Alfre Woodard writes in her preface, ``Robin Hood was

 &QL; 
``HAWKE'S COVE'' &QL; 
By Susan Wilson (Pocket, $23.95) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Here's one for the ``Bridges of Madison County'' crowd, another
novel that attempts to parlay yearning and denial into a bad but
bittersweet bestseller. A young journal-keeping woman named Vangie
retreats to her grandmother's farm in a small coastal town (note
the title) to recover from the death of her baby and to wait for
news of her husband, who is overseas fighting in World War II. It's
not long before a down-on-his-luck stranger named Joe shows up, and
we know what that means. Vangie hires him to work on the farm, they
drink tea and lemonade, they watch each other through lowered
lashes, they swim (``There is,'' Wilson writes, ``a strange
intimacy in swimming . . .''), she spreads ointment on his
blistered hands. When Vangie's husband is declared missing in
action, she and Joe have a hot night together in the hayloft, but
word comes the very next morning that the husband is still alive.
Denial commences. Years pass. Violins play. Their children grow up
and get nosey. Have you been here before? You betcha. &QL; 
 &QL; 
``FOREVER LIESL'' &QL; 
By Charmian Carr (Viking, $23.95) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   We were hoping to find some dirt here, but according to Carr,
there was precious little of it on the set of ``The Sound of
Music.'' Until now, the only relief from the unrelenting sweetness
of the film was an anecdote about Christopher Plummer, who played
Baron von Trapp and who allegedly hated the movie so much he called
it ``The Sound of Mucus.'' But Carr, who played the von Trapp
daughter Liesl, debunks that story, saying that Plummer himself
denies it (he did despise the song ``Edelweiss'' and tried to have
it tossed from the film). Mostly, this book is a cheerful report on
a cheerful experience, with some funny moments on the side. When
she attended the Mexican premiere (the film was called ``La Novicia
Rebelde,'' or ``The Rebellious Novice''), the unsuspecting Carr was
taken to a bullfight. The matador dedicated the bull to her, and
she watched in horror as the bull was tormented by the matador and
the matador was then run over by the bull. She visited the matador
in the hospital, as Liesl certainly would have done if she'd been
there. &QL; 
 &QL; 
``THE VISION OF EMMA BLAU'' &QL; 
By Ursula Hegi (Simon &AMP; Schuster, $25) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Hegi's new novel is a family saga that begins in the early
1900s, when scrappy teenager Stefan Blau comes to America from
Germany (specifically from Burgdorf, which figures into Hegi's
earlier books, ``Stones From the River'' and ``Floating in My
Mother's Palm''), and sets out to make his fortune. After a fire in
the New York restaurant where he works, he leaves the city and goes
to a small town in New Hampshire because a fellow immigrant has
told him it reminded him of Germany. There, Stefan marries twice
and loses both wives to the births of his children before he
returns to Burgdorf to bring back and marry Helene Montag, his
childhood friend and the character through which Hegi explores the
difficult adjustment of the German immigrant. Serving as a backdrop
for the story is the Wasserburg, the grand and glorious apartment
building that Stefan builds, which reflects the fortunes of his
family. Hegi's characterization is superb, part of a story that is
as well-constructed as the Wasserburg itself.  &QL;

 By JAMES GLANZ   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MARINA DEL REY, Calif. _ The last hopes for a universe filled
with familiar stuff behaving in comprehensible ways died here in
Los Angeles County last week. It showed in the head-turning attire
of at least two of the scientists who carried the news to a major
conference on cosmology in a hotel across the street from a
restaurant called Killer Shrimp.
</P>
<P>
   But never mind the shrimp. Dr. Joel Primack spoke about the
overall contents of the universe while wearing a midnight blue
jacket and a tie that bore the likeness of Van Gogh's ``Starry
Night,'' in which some ominous presence between the stars
overwhelms the visible bodies themselves. In her own talk, Dr.
Katherine Freese heralded ``The Death of Baryonic Dark Matter'' in
an all-black pantsuit.
</P>
<P>
   Baryons are the ordinary particles, like protons and neutrons,
of which stars, asteroids, comets, planets, people and textiles are
made. By measuring the gravitational pull of some unknown ``dark
matter'' on the visible stars and galaxies, astronomers have
determined that this mysterious material which seems to permeate
the universe has a weight that is 60 times that of the stars and 7
times that of all baryons, including gas and solid material in
space.
</P>
<P>
   By combining calculations with observational data, Freese
reported that she had eliminated the last shred of possibility that
the dark matter is ordinary, baryonic material. Primack, his tie
providing mute acknowledgment, added that an unknown form of dark
energy permeating space is apparently pushing against gravity on
large scales. There is so much of this dark energy, sometimes
called quintessence or the cosmological constant, that it in effect
has a weight almost twice that of all matter, dark or visible.
</P>
<P>
   Cosmologists have seen evidence for the dark matter and dark
energy for some time. What has changed is that for now, there seems
to be little chance of escaping the conclusion that the stuff of
which we are made amounts to no more than cufflinks on the cosmic
tuxedo, as it were.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bulk of the energy density in the universe seems to be
dark energy,'' said Primack, who is at the University of
California, Santa Cruz. ``And the big question is, What is the dark
energy?''
</P>
<P>
   A similar state of affairs holds for the dark matter, he said.
But despite the lingering mysteries, he said, most cosmologists are
far from put off by a universe filled with dark, strange and
unknown stuff. ``Most professionals in this field have had a long
time to get used to these ideas,'' Primack said.
</P>
<P>
   He added that the professionals were pleased that reigning
theories of how the universe was born, generated chemical elements
and formed structures like galaxies mesh remarkably well with the
observed amounts of ordinary matter, dark matter and dark energy in
space. Many of those theories deal only with the overall balance
sheets of matter and energy and not their details.
</P>
<P>
   While it is true that those dark details remain to be explained,
he said, ``I tend to think of this more as a problem for
fundamental physicists, and less for me.''
</P>
<P>
   As recently as a few years ago, a group of astronomers called
the Macho collaboration thought they had found the dark matter in
chunks of presumably baryonic material orbiting in a huge cloud, or
halo, around the Milky Way. (Macho is an acronym for the ``massive
compact halo objects'' in question.)
</P>
<P>
   The main evidence came from observing brief brightenings of
stars outside the Milky Way. The Macho collaboration concluded that
these brightenings had occurred when the objects, assumed to be in
the halo, passed directly between Earth and distant stars and
magnified the light of the stars behind them. The gravity of the
objects, each roughly the mass of our Sun, acted as a kind of lens,
just as Einstein's equations of relativity say that they should.
</P>
<P>
   The discoveries seemed to fit nicely with the longstanding
observation that galaxies like the Milky Way spin too fast to be
held together only by the gravity of visible matter _ a main
argument for the existence of dark matter in the universe. Was it
possible that the dim objects, suggested by the lensing
observations, could be the galactic dark matter?
</P>
<P>
   The answer turns out to be no, Freese said in her talk. The
so-called ``white dwarf'' stars, which those objects would almost
certainly have to be, would have to be the remnants of a population
of stars that over their lifetimes would have spewed out
substantial amounts of gas, heavy elements and infrared radiation _
none of which are seen.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, she said, such a large quantity of baryons in
galaxies like the Milky Way could not be reconciled with accepted
theories of how elements formed in the Big Bang explosion in which
the universe is thought to have been born.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's looking very likely that 50 to 90 percent of our galaxy
is nonbaryonic,'' said Freese, a University of Michigan physicist.
</P>
<P>
   In the same session, which was held at the Fourth International
Symposium on Sources and Detection of Dark Matter in the Universe,
members of the Macho collaboration and a related French
collaboration called EROS conceded that the high rate at which they
initially observed lensing events was probably a statistical fluke,
at best.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are not enough machos in the galactic halo,'' said Dr.
Eric Aubourg of EROS. ``It looks like everybody agrees on this.''
</P>
<P>
   So what is the dark matter? As tempting as the supposition may
be, it could not be killer shrimp, which would presumably be
baryonic. Theorists believe it could exist in clouds of nonbaryonic
particles called Wimps, for weakly interacting massive particles.
At the same conference, two experimental groups _ one based in Rome
and one at 10 American institutions _ presented conflicting
evidence on whether Wimps have been detected. But that argument
remains for the future.
</P>
<P>
   While some astronomers presented fresh evidence that dark energy
is filling the space between galaxies, counteracting their gravity
and accelerating the expansion of the universe, Dr. Edwin L. Turner
of Princeton University pointed out that a few observations can
still be found that do not fit the concordance that cosmologists
have found with their theories.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone is impressed with the elegance of the dark new
universe. ``It's a bit little ugly, isn't it?'' said Turner. ``A
little of this, a little of that _ I think this would have been
considered appalling a decade ago.''

 &HT;    Recharged Weiss happy to be playing
 &HT;    By Carroll Rogers
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   KISSIMMEE, Fla. _ After another season of injuries and
disappointment, Walt Weiss got little relief in the offseason.
</P>
<P>
   Weiss spent those months in fear that the Braves would acquire
another shortstop _ a younger version with a bigger bat and less of
a propensity to popping muscles.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves traded for Jose Hernandez in July after Weiss
struggled to return from a quadriceps pull. The Braves didn't
re-sign Hernandez after the season, but they were linked to
Toronto's Alex Gonzalez, and the organization was excited about
19-year-old prospect Rafael Furcal.
</P>
<P>
   Then came the December deal for Reggie Sanders and Quilvio Veras
to revamp the top of the order, and Weiss' job appeared to be safe
again. Weiss still isn't completely convinced, but he is recharged.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even when the Braves didn't sign Jose Hernandez back, I still
wasn't sure the Braves had lost confidence in me or not,'' Weiss
said. ``I still don't know. Given my injuries the last two years,
I'm sure it's a concern, and justifiably so. But at the same time,
I feel real good about this year. There's no doubt in my mind I can
go out and perform and be a vital part of this team.''
</P>
<P>
   Weiss was hitting .279 and riding a 13-game hitting streak when
he pulled his quadriceps May 26. He took a week off and tried to
come back, but three games later he went on the disabled list.
</P>
<P>
   He didn't return to the lineup until July 1, and by then his
swing felt foreign. He finished the year hitting .226, his worst
average since 1992.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year, as bad as it was, I think if I hadn't missed that
time, I don't think it would have been an issue, the shortstop
position,'' Weiss said. ``When I came back after a month, I
struggled to find it again. And then after three weeks, they
brought Jose in. I didn't have any opportunity to salvage the
season. I'm not complaining, or blaming Bobby (Cox). With Javy
Lopez going down and Cat (Andres Galarraga) not playing, we needed
some more punch offensively. I understand that.''
</P>
<P>
   Weiss, 36, knows he can do little about injuries, so he's doing
his best to put them in the back of his mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel I'm in as good a shape as anybody, regardless of age,
because of what I do in the winter,'' he said. ``The only thing
that will make the questions subside is me going out and
performing. When you're younger, people are waiting for you to play
well. When you're older, they're waiting for you to play poorly.''
</P>
<P>
   Weiss took consolation in the postseason when he not only earned
his starting job back but made the defensive play of October by
stabbing a grounder to save the Braves in a bases-loaded situation
in a Division Series win over Houston.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always been in the middle of whatever's going on with the
club,'' Weiss said. ``Last year in the second half, I wasn't part
of much. . . . The postseason meant a lot to me, because all of a
sudden I was a big part of some real big games. Without the
postseason, last year would have been awful.''
</P>
<P>
   Weiss takes some comfort in returning to the eighth spot in the
order, which is much more natural to him than hitting leadoff.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can play defense,'' Weiss said, ``sneak back into the eighth
spot and just kind of ride on everyone else's back (offensively).''

 &HT;    Auburn star admits taking agent's money
 &HT;    By Tony Barnhart
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Auburn basketball star Chris Porter told school and SEC
officials that he took slightly more than $2,000 from a possible
agent in order to keep his mother from being evicted from her home.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the admissionwill save the college career of the senior
forward has not been determined.
</P>
<P>
   Porter, a candidate for national player of the year, was
declared ineligible before Sunday's game at Florida. Auburn
officials had learned that Porter had accepted money from an agent
or the representative of an agent.
</P>
<P>
   He was in Gainesville, Fla., on Saturday night but immediately
was flown home on an Auburn University jet when coaches were
informed of the allegations.
</P>
<P>
   Auburn coach Cliff Ellis confirmed Monday that Porter had
accepted the money and that the school would appeal to the NCAA to
have him reinstated.
</P>
<P>
   ``What transpired is there was a transaction that took place;
Chris has admitted to that,'' Ellis said on the SEC's weekly
conference call of coaches. ``We are now going through it to make
sure all the pieces of the puzzle fit.''
</P>
<P>
   Indications are that Porter will not be available for Wednesday
night's big SEC game with LSU in Auburn. But if Porter repays the
money, school officials hope that Porter could be reinstated before
next week's SEC Tournament in Atlanta or the beginning of the NCAA
Tournament on March 16.
</P>
<P>
   Auburn lost to Florida on Sunday and now is 21-6, 9-5 in the
SEC. The Tigers are ranked 19th by the Associated Press and 13th in
the USA Today/ESPN coaches' poll.
</P>
<P>
   Porter missed Thursday's practice to visit his mother, Emily,
who lives in Abbeville, Ala., approximately 100 miles from Auburn.
Apparently, it was at that time that Porter received the money to
help his mother with some financial problems. By Saturday, Auburn
officials had heard about it and called Porter home from
Gainesville.
</P>
<P>
   Porter told Auburn and SEC officials that he did not know the
man who provided the money was an agent or the representative of an
agent.
</P>
<P>
   Porter was projected to go in the first-round of the NBA draft
when he decided to return to Auburn and play his senior season.
</P>

   An obviously frustrated Ellis insisted that Porter should be
given the benefit of the doubt, given his circumstances and his
willlingness to come back to school this season and pass on the
NBA's millions.

   ``If he goes and tells the truth, which I believe he has,''
Ellis said, ``then let's move as smartly as possible, as wisely as
possible, and let him come back and play the game that he decided a
year ago to come back to.''

 &HT;    Holyfield extends quest to be undisputed champ
 &HT;    By Curtis Bunn
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ After considerable prayer and a commitment to a
career-long ambition, former heavyweight champion Evander Holyfield
is extending his 14-year professional boxing career.
</P>
<P>
   ``It ain't over yet,'' the 36-year-old Holyfield gleefully
proclaimed Monday. Holyfield, who lost the undisputed heavyweight
championship to Lennox Lewis in November, said he will fight again
May 20. Neither the opponent nor the site has been agreed to, but
Holyfield probably will fight one of four contenders _ Henry
Akinwande, David Tua, John Ruiz or Ray Mercer. The place probably
will be Las Vegas or New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``The big thing is that I didn't want to do it out of ego,''
Holyfield said. ``There is no reason more than praying about it and
realizing I can still do it. My body and health are good.
Everything just lines up right.''
</P>
<P>
   Holyfield's attorney, Jim Thomas, outlined a scenario that could
grant his client and friend a championship fight: The WBA title
would be vacant if Lewis is stripped of that belt for fighting
Michael Grant instead of the mandatory bout against No. 1-ranked
Akinwande. Then, the No. 2-ranked Holyfield could return to meet
Akinwande for the chance to become the only heavyweight in history
to win four titles.
</P>
<P>
   That route would expedite his plan. The quest to retire as the
undisputed champion _ and his belief that he still possesses the
skills and durability to regain the title belts now belonging to
Lewis _ overrides the expected public outcry that Holyfield should
quit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know what people are going to say; I've heard people say I
should retire since '92,'' he said. ``That doesn't bother me at
all. I have to do what I want to do, not what anyone else wants.''
</P>
<P>
   Holyfield said he is looking at a larger picture than what
continuing his career will do for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will inspire people not to quit,'' he insisted. ``If you
believe you can still accomplish what you want, go for it.''
</P>
<P>
   After losing the close decision in the rematch with Lewis,
Holyfield wanted to announce that night that he would fight again.
``I felt like saying, `Yeah, I want to do it,' because I felt I did
well, that I won the fight. But I didn't want to come off as crying
about the decision,'' he said. ``I needed to show dignity and let
Lennox have his day. And I didn't want it to be so quick that it
seems like an ego thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``The big reason is that I set a goal to be the undisputed
heavyweight champion,'' Holyfield said. ``If I had won, I would
have gone around the country and world putting on exhibitions to
show loyalty to the fans. I lost, but I didn't lose sight of the
goal. I've always had to overcome something. Now, I've got to
overcome something else.''

REBUILDING THE BREAST WITH SKIN-SPARING MASTECTOMIES

c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When a mammogram and biopsy identified two malignant tumors in
her right breast a year and a half ago, all Carolyn Walls-Purvis
wanted was to get them out _ fast.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was cut from my collarbone to my waist in almost a V. The
scar was very big, very ugly. They took out all the muscle and
lymph nodes, and the skin was stretched and pulled tight and ugly.
With chemotherapy and radiation, it was even more drawn,'' she
recalls.
</P>
<P>
   Before she finished chemo, her oncologist found a lump in her
other breast. Walls-Purvis was horrified.
</P>
<P>
   Still in shock, she was referred by her Denison doctors to Fort
Worth for a second mastectomy and immediate reconstruction on both
sides.
</P>
<P>
   Her left breast was removed through a ``keyhole'' incision,
using a new skin-sparing surgical technique, on May 6, 1999,
exactly a year after the first surgery, a modified radical
mastectomy.
</P>
<P>
   Both breasts were reconstructed using her own abdominal tissue
in what is known as a TRAM flap reconstruction (named for the
transverse abdominal myocutaneous muscle).
</P>
<P>
   What a difference for Walls-Purvis, 52.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now the way it looks is like I never had any breast surgery,''
she says. ``My `before' pictures of the right side are really,
really bad. Now it looks almost as good as the other. They both
look and seem so natural. They did within weeks, and it's all my
own tissue.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm amazed this right one looks so good. There's just a slight
hairline scar at the top, and the left one never had a scar because
the surgeon here left all the skin so it could be used as a pocket.
It just looks like my normal breast. They didn't keep the nipple
but built complete new ones for both sides out of little skin tabs
they made. The nipples were done in October.''
</P>
<P>
   Walls-Purvis says she recently purchased a ``regular swimsuit''
so she could start using her hot tub again. Her husband, Steve,
says he has to look twice to remind himself she has had a
mastectomy, even without a swimsuit.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one can tell. She looks good, and the cancer is gone. She's
healthy again. That's what's important,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   As a bonus, a tummy bulge as well as scars from two previous
C-sections and a hysterectomy were eliminated with reconstruction,
and Walls-Purvis has a perfect new navel.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a miracle, just a miracle,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Mastectomies today are increasingly done with reconstruction in
mind. Surgeons save the breast skin as a form, filling it
immediately with living tissue from the patient's abdomen. A
follow-up surgery reconstructs a nipple. The result is a
natural-looking breast.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the reconstructions we are doing now are designed to give
the patient the look of her original breast and quite possibly
improve on it,'' says Dr. Shujaat Khan, the Fort Worth plastic
surgeon who reconstructed Walls-Purvis' breasts.
</P>
<P>
   In most cases today, that means removing the tumor through a
keyhole incision and using a flap of the patient's own abdominal
tissue _ skin, muscle and blood vessels _ to reconstruct the breast
mound immediately. Tissue from the back can also be used in
reconstructing smaller breasts or when abdominal scars are a
problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the '80s, when a patient was evaluated for breast
reconstruction, the goal was to provide a mound so she could fill
her clothes and not have to use an external prosthesis that slips
and slides,'' says Dr. Brian Burns, a Plano plastic surgeon who
specializes in breast reconstruction at St. Paul Medical Center in
Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, when we see someone for breast reconstruction, our goal
is to make her look better after surgery than she did before she
knew she needed a mastectomy,'' says Burns. ``If you can work with
the general surgeon to save as much of the skin as safely possible,
results are amazingly good. The more skin they can leave us, the
better.
</P>
<P>
   ``Skin-sparing surgical techniques are the best thing that's
happened in the last couple of years,'' Burns says.
</P>
<P>
   The surgical method allows a modified radical mastectomy through
a circular cut around the nipple and a straight incision just to
the edge of the breast to remove lymph nodes or a simple circular
incision and separate small incision under the arm to remove the
nodes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It totally changes the concept of how natural reconstruction
can look,'' Khan says.
</P>
<P>
   Skin-sparing surgery and a new procedure to enhance blood
circulation to the abdominal muscle before it is used in
reconstruction are the latest improvements in the ever-evolving art
of breast reconstruction.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there is not enough tissue to (make the breasts) match, you
can add a tissue expander or an implant, but 99 percent of the time
with an abdominal flap and skin-conserving mastectomy, there is no
need for an implant. We can reconstruct the breast entirely from
abdominal fat,'' says Khan, who has now done about 1,000
reconstructions with abdominal flaps immediately following
mastectomies.
</P>
<P>
   MORE nn
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, it is an extremely gratifying surgery.'' he says.
``We are now down to doing them in less than two hours, and
patients seldom need a transfusion. When reconstruction is done
with autologous (the patient's own) tissue, there is no difficulty
with radiation or chemotherapy following surgery, and no problems
with finding any future recurrence of cancer.''
</P>
<P>
   With the new procedure to enhance circulation, almost anyone is
a good candidate for reconstruction, Khan says.
</P>
<P>
   The aesthetic advances in breast reconstruction are made
possible by earlier diagnosis, says Dr. John Freese, a surgical
oncologist who has performed many mastectomies during his 36 years
of practice in Fort Worth.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the concept of radical mastectomy was developed in the
1890s, the breast, muscles, lymph nodes and most of the skin were
all taken, and a skin graft was almost always required just to
cover the surgical site,'' Freese says. ``But for many years, they
were dealing with advanced tumors, usually so advanced they had
broken through the skin. That's the only way they knew they were
there.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then, for 30 or 40 years, we did surgery as soon as we could
feel the tumor. Now we remove them as soon as they show up on
mammograms _ usually they are 1/4 to 1/2 inches in diameter, and
often they are too small to feel,'' Freese points out.
</P>
<P>
   In those cases, surgeons can leave most of the skin. The
original envelope of the breast is there, so any difficulties with
placement or size or position of the nipple are resolved. The
nipple is taken because milk ducts run up in the nipple and can
hide tumor tissue, but almost all the rest of the breast skin is
left.
</P>
<P>
   ``The next big step now is prevention,'' says Freese, who has
been performing about 100 mastectomies a year. ``We have got to
find ways to prevent breast cancer.''
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   WHAT'S NEW WITH IMPLANTS &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The silicone scare of the '90s inspired doctors to find better
ways to use a patient's own (autologous) tissue for breast
reconstruction and prompted scientists to look for better materials
for breast augmentation.
</P>
<P>
   Most breast cancer patients now are choosing immediate
reconstruction with a football-shaped wedge of tissue from their
own abdomens.
</P>
<P>
   But other types of implants are still an option for mastectomy
patients _ and for the increasing numbers of women who opt for
breast-enlargement surgery. In the past couple of years, the number
of women undergoing breast enlargement surgery has risen about 25
percent, according to the American Society for Aesthetic Plastic
Surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Clinical studies before and since the scare show silicone breast
implants are, in fact, safe. Last fall, they were cleared by a
special panel of scientists appointed by the federal judge
overseeing cases nationwide. In 1998, after an independent review
of the research on silicone breast implants, a 12-member National
Science Panel appointed by the U.S. Institute of Medicine found no
convincing evidence of any association between implants and
disease, including autoimmune diseases and cancer.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we have learned from all this is that implants have a
shelf life,'' says Dr. Shujaat Khan, a Fort Worth plastic surgeon
who specializes in breast reconstruction. ``We should be checking
them (all implants) at least every five years to be sure they are
in good condition,'' not leaking or disintegrating.
</P>
<P>
   Now a lot more autologous tissue is being used for
reconstruction, but women who choose implants for reconstruction
want silicone, and they have been among the few who could get
silicone under Food and Drug Administration restrictions that still
allow the silicone implants only for breast reconstruction, implant
replacement and treatment of severe sagging.
</P>
<P>
   Saline-filled breast implants have been the mainstay of breast
augmentation procedures since the FDA's 1992 ban on silicone
gel-filled implants.
</P>
<P>
   But, for mastectomy patients, silicone gel gives a much more
natural look if an implant is needed, says Linda S. Cornelison, a
Fort Worth breast cancer survivor and health educator. ``With
almost no loose breast tissue, saline doesn't work nearly as well
for reconstruction as it does for augmentation when the original
tissue is all still there.
</P>
<P>
   ``Silicone gel has regained popularity primarily because it
produces the most natural-feeling breast,'' says Dr. Scott Spear,
author of an article on implants in the October issue of
``Aesthetic Surgery Journal.'' ``With scientific studies supporting
its safety, a number of manufacturers may decide to take the steps
defined by the FDA as necessary for the return of silicone
gel-filled implants to non-restricted use.''
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, new materials are being tested.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Europe, they are using a wonderful new gel implant that has
the consistency of a solid Jell-O. It is solid enough that you can
slice it in two with a knife and it doesn't flow. It moves, very
lifelike. It jiggles,'' says Khan.
</P>
<P>
   Around the world, almost 40,000 of the cohesive silicone gel
devices that hold their shape have been implanted.
</P>
<P>
   Another type of implant that is expected to enter the U.S.
regulatory process by the end of this year is a polyvinylpyrolidone
(PVP) device, which was originally introduced in the late 1980s,
then reformulated for the '90s. Like silicone, PVP has a long
history of medical applications. Its new hydrogel formulation for
breast implants has been tested and used in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   FDA approval of both the cohesive gel and the PVP implants is
expected within the next couple of years.

FEDERAL JUDGE ILLEGALLY GAGS ENVIRONMENTAL GROUP

<P>
   Information received from a Freedom of Information Act request
is presumed to be in the public domain _ or the federal government
would not have released it. That's basic law. But a judge in New
Mexico inexplicably sees it differently. He has stopped an
environmental group from sharing information with the public that
it gained from an FOIA request.
</P>
<P>
   Back in 1998, Forest Guardians, an environmental group based in
Santa Fe, N.M., filed an FOIA request with the U.S. Forest Service
seeking information regarding banks that hold grazing permits on
public lands administered by the Forest Service.
</P>
<P>
   It isn't widely known that numerous banks in the West hold USFS
grazing permits on loans made to ranchers under the Forest
Service's escrow-waiver program.
</P>
<P>
   When a rancher defaults on one of these loans, the bank sells
the grazing permits along with the private property that was the
base for the permits and the loan. The grazing permits are, in
every sense, treated as property by these banks _ despite federal
appeals court rulings that a permittee has no legitimate claim of
entitlement to a grazing permit.
</P>
<P>
   If a rancher cannot treat his grazing permits as property, then
neither can a bank.
</P>
<P>
   Some ranchers in New Mexico, Utah, Colorado, Wyoming and Montana
hold USFS grazing permits on public-land acreage that far exceeds
their private property base. A rancher may own 1,000 acres and have
grazing permits on 80,000 adjacent acres. Naturally, the rancher's
grazing permits enhance the value of his private property.
</P>
<P>
   Forest Guardians wants to make any information concerning the
use of USFS grazing permits as loan collateral available to the
public _ the banks involved, the total amount of loans made on
grazing permits, the number of permittees, permits and acreage
involved.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Forest Service complied with a portion of the Forest
Guardians' FOIA request. However, the agency blacked out some
information that was pertinent to the request. After negotiations
came to a standstill in June 1999, the Forest Guardians filed a
lawsuit in federal court to get that missing information.
</P>
<P>
   In November, the Forest Service and Forest Guardians came to an
tentative agreement to provide that information.
</P>
<P>
   However, that same month before the lawsuit could be resolved, a
group of ranchers and banks filed a motion to intervene in the
case. They argued that the information released to Forest Guardians
should not be made public, that making such information public
violates the federal Privacy Act. They filed a motion to that
effect.
</P>
<P>
   Senior U.S. District Judge for the District of New Mexico Edwin
L. Mechem has allowed the ranchers and bankers to gag the Forest
Guardians since December. The judge has stalled and stalled on the
ranchers' and bankers' request for a temporary order to forbid the
distribution of the information about the widespread use of escrow
waivers.
</P>
<P>
   The judge is stalling for good reason. Legally, the judge cannot
prohibit the distribution of information gained through an FOIA
request.
</P>
<P>
   In a response to the motion by the ranchers and bankers, the
U.S. attorney's office in Albuquerque told the court it had no
legal authority to grant such a motion and ``it should be denied
out of hand.''
</P>
<P>
   The Freedom of Information Act only allows a federal court to
prohibit a federal agency from withholding agency records and to
order the release of records improperly withheld. The act does not
provide the court with any legal basis to stop the distribution of
information gained through an FOIA request.
</P>
<P>
   It stands to reason that any information released under an FOIA
request is public information. That's why the government was forced
to release it under the Freedom of Information Act.
</P>
<P>
   And the Privacy Act only authorizes a civil action against an
agency improperly releasing records. The act does not authorize an
action against those who received those records.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, the information that the Forest Guardians have thus
far been prohibited from distributing to the public is available to
the public in every county courthouse in the West. A county
courthouse records deeds, loans and promissory notes on properties
within the county. And that information is available to the public.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the judge continues to stall on Forest Guardians'
right to distribute the information on USFS grazing permits used as
loan collateral.
</P>
<P>
   Mechem set a possible date for hearing arguments in May, but
that will be set further back because of a new filing by the cattle
and banking industries. In other words, the judge has put into
place a de facto illegal injunction that indefinitely prohibits
disseminating information on the USFS escrow-waiver program.
</P>
<P>
   Mechem, the former governor of New Mexico back in the 1950s,
shames himself by his actions in this case, and shames the robes he
wears as a federal judge. However protective he may feel about the
ranching industry, Mechem cannot legally gag the Forest Guardians.
The information they received from the Forest Service belongs to
the public.

BRADLEY BRINGS CAMPAIGN TO CALIFORNIA 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   SEATTLE _ Bill Bradley ended his risky Washington gambit Monday,
heading south and leaving voters to show if he wasted five precious
days trying to win the state's nonbinding ``beauty contest''
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   As Bradley set out for California, the biggest prize in a round
of primaries on March 7 that will make or break his candidacy, he
received a rousing sendoff from a crowd of more than 2,000 in a
cold rain in the quadrangle at the University of Washington.
</P>
<P>
   But he all but conceded before the event that he did not expect
to defeat Vice President Al Gore in Washington despite the extra
time and money he invested.
</P>
<P>
   A weekend survey by a Seattle television station showed Bradley
trailing Gore by nine points, a far cry from Gore's earlier
25-point cushion but less than Bradley had counted on to provide
his stalled campaign a shot of adrenaline heading into next week's
primaries.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw the numbers before we got here,'' Bradley said in a news
conference at a women's health clinic in Seattle. ``I knew there
would be entrenched power. I knew it would be difficult, and it has
been.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore, who is backed by the state's Democratic establishment,
made a major push in Washington over the weekend to counter
Bradley's effort.
</P>
<P>
   In Denver Monday, Gore never mentioned Bradley as he took a few
shots at the two leading Republican candidates, accusing them of
being ``in the hip pocket'' of the National Rifle Association. He
also singled out John McCain before taking off to campaign in the
Arizona senator's home state.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are some things I agree with John McCain on, like
campaign finance reform and taking on the tobacco industry and
taking on special interests,'' Gore told a crowd at the Performing
Arts Center here, drawing a loud cheer.
</P>
<P>
   But ``the Republican Party today is in the midst of a huge
identity crisis,'' Gore said. ``They don't know who they are.''
</P>
<P>
   In Seattle, Bradley argued that his Washington strategy had not
hurt his national effort because he spent an hour or more each day
conducting television interviews via satellite in states across the
country.
</P>
<P>
   ``So I've been everywhere while I've been here,'' Bradley said.
``That's one of the advantages of politics today.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he accomplished one of his goals in Washington by
defining himself as the ``reform-plus'' candidate in contrast to
McCain, who has been surging in the Repubican race with a message
of reform.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm the reform candidate-plus,'' Bradley said, ``meaning you
can have a reform candidate who is also pro-choice, pro-gun
control, invests in education and health, and is strong on the
environment. That's relevant to voters across the country who want
reform but don't want the most conservative agenda in the world,
which is what you would get with the Republican.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley, despite discouraging polls in most states that hold
primaries March 7, remained optimistic.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's important to remember that the delegate count right now
is 41-27'' in Gore's favor, Bradley said. ``The difference between
Al Gore and me is less in delegates than the difference between
John McCain and George W. Bush.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley is hoping to gain ground Wednesday night in Los Angeles,
when he and Gore engage in their final debate before the March 7
contests.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley also launched his national ad campaign Monday with
30-second biographical television spots in New York, Maryland and
every New England state but New Hampshire. He is expected to hit
the airwaves in California Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   But his campaign staff refused to say whether Bradley will
compete with paid advertising in every state that holds primaries
next week, including such large states as Ohio and Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley reiterated that his campaign's survival hinges on a
respectable showing. ``I have to win several primaries on March
7,'' he said. ``I have to take off in that period of time, no
question about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Senator Patty Murray, a Washington senator who is
backing Gore, issued a statement criticizing a Bradley aide for
purportedly saying, ``Gore has courted the party establishment, the
party hacks.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In New Hampshire, Bill Bradley made a big point of writing
`respect the people' next to his statement of candidacy,'' Murray
said. ``Here in Washington, his campaign has called Gore supporters
`party hacks.' That's not respect. That's an affront.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's spokesman, Eric Hauser, said he was not aware of
anyone in the campaign using the term ``hack.''

   Title would have Driesell basking in distinction
</P>
<P>
   By Mark Bradleyc. 2000 Cox News Service
</P>
<P>
   ATLANTA _Lyndon Johnson was president. The inaugural Super Bowl
was 10 months away. The transplanted Braves were about to open in
the new Atlanta-Fulton County Stadium. It was 1966, and Lefty
Driesell was coaching in his first NCAA Tournament. Or as the
proceedings were then known, the nationals.
</P>
<P>
   His Davidson team was playing Syracuse, which was headed by a
guard who would become the 1967 NBA rookie of the year. Driesell
tried to inspire Dick Snyder, his own fine guard, by taping
Snyder's picture alongside Dave Bing's. The coach added this
message: ``Will the real All-American please stand up?''
</P>
<P>
   Driesell smiles wryly. ``Bing stood up,'' he says. ``Snyder
wasn't bad, but Bing was awesome.''
</P>
<P>
   Syracuse would win 94-78. Near the end, an assistant coach
wondered if Davidson should call a timeout. ``No,'' Driesell
remembers saying. ``I want to get out of here as fast as I can.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, Driesell coaches Georgia State. On Saturday his Panthers
tied for the Trans America Athletic Conference regular-season
championship. If they win the TAAC Tournament this weekend,
Driesell will find himself swimming in distinctions. He will
become:
</P>
<P>
   _ The second coach to take four different schools to the NCAA
Tournament, Eddie Sutton being the first. ``And Eddie's been a lot
better places than I have,'' Driesell says.
</P>
<P>
   _The first coach to grace the NCAA Tournament in five different
decades, having taken Davidson in the '60s, Maryland in the '70s
and '80s and James Madison in the '90s.
</P>
<P>
   _The coach with the longest span between his first and latest
NCAA appearances. Lou Henson holds the mark at 32 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't bother with that (statistical) stuff,'' Driesell says.
``I just want to go for the players. None of them has been to the
NCAA.''
</P>
<P>
   Driesell is 68, a grandfather eight times over. Yet here he is,
in his third season on the unassuming Concrete Campus, still
craving after all these years. Referring to the TAAC Tournament, a
visitor says, ``If you win . . . .'' Driesell flares. ``You mean,
`When we win.' ''
</P>
<P>
   The Panthers, who lost their first six games, are 16-11. They
will be seeded No. 2 in Jacksonville, and they already have beaten
top-seeded Troy State. It could happen. Thirty-four years after
being torched by Dave Bing, the Lefthander could be part of March
Madness again. ``It's a lot different now,'' he says. ``It's almost
gotten too big.''
</P>
<P>
   Back in 1966, nobody watched the selection show on CBS. No such
program existed. ``My AD would call me,'' Driesell says, ``and tell
me who we were playing.'' Not until 1969 would the tournament be
carried by a major network. The whole affair was so low-key that,
on the day before the 1970 championship game, Sports Illustrated
reported that ``Lefty Driesell of the host University of Maryland,
whose ambition it is to make his school `the UCLA of the East' . .
. upstaged the team workouts (by announcing) the signing of two New
York City high school stars.''
</P>
<P>
   An SI cover featuring Len Elmore, one of those New Yorkers, sits
on a shelf in Driesell's windowless office. The place could serve
as a museum. A framed collage commemorates Maryland's 1986 victory
in the Dean Dome. A black-and-white photo shows Driesell aloft on a
sea of shoulders after a 1971 upset of No. 2 South Carolina. A
newspaper clipping, mounted and yellowed, recalls Driesell's first
collegiate victory. The date was Dec. 2, 1960. The opponent was
Wake Forest. The Demon Deacons' leading scorer, with 17 points, was
Billy Packer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I keep saying I'll quit coaching when I start losing,''
Driesell says. ``When we were 0-6, I thought this might be my year.
But it's getting to be fun again. I want to get Georgia State
going. I think this can be a real good basketball school, like
Cincinnati.''
</P>
<P>
   He is wearing his 1984 ACC championship ring, which he seldom
does. He can't decide whether to show it to his players. ``It might
fire them up,'' he says, ``but you've got to be careful. I don't
know whether you should act like we're playing for all the marbles
or just Win No. 17.''
</P>
<P>
   And motivational ploys, the Lefthander knows, can fizzle. He
recalls Dave Bing, who was such a focal point that the Davidson
coach was oblivious to all else. Recently Driesell played golf with
Syracuse coach Jim Boeheim. The 1966 NCAA Tournament was mentioned.
</P>
<P>
   ``I played in that game,'' Boeheim said. ``I scored 16 points.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I just remember Bing,'' Driesell said. ``I don't remember
you.''
</P>
<P>
   Hey, it was a while ago.

INDIA'S BEST BRAINS ARE RETURNING WITH MONEY AND HIGH HOPES
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By CELIA W. DUGGER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOMBAY, India _ During the past generation, tens of thousands of
Indian engineers left home for America and many got rich _ some
fabulously rich _ in the high technology boom. Along the way, they
became symbols of a brain drain that scholars believed was sucking
the best and brightest minds out of Third World countries.
</P>
<P>
   But an increasing though still modest number of India's biggest
American success stories, whose lives are now firmly rooted in the
United States, are beginning to come home to India, too, and not
just to visit relatives, but to start companies, invest their
capital and indulge their philanthropic instincts. Some say they
should no longer be seen as proof of the brain drain, but as signs
of a brain trust _ a view economists say is still overly
optimistic.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, in an era when airplanes, telephones, e-mail and fax
machines have transformed the lives of prosperous immigrants,
economists say that the linear idea of a one-way brain drain is
giving way to a different paradigm of brains that circulate between
native and adopted countries.
</P>
<P>
   That pattern is now emerging in India, which watched as perhaps
25,000 of its top graduates since the late 1960s moved to the
United States. In the years when the technology explosion hit
America, these Indians emerged as major players and now run more
than 750 technology companies in California's Silicon Valley alone.
</P>
<P>
   One of those who got away was Kanwal S. Rekhi, 54, who now
periodically comes back for what he calls his ``missionary work in
India.'' He said he went to America so his brain wouldn't go down
the drain in socialist India, made $300 million as an entrepreneur,
executive and private investor in Silicon Valley and retired five
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Now, at the request of the prime minister's office in an India
that is more market driven, he is among those trying to raise $1
billion for the six Indian Institutes of Technology, elite public
universities here known as IITs, which produced the thousands of
graduates who left for the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The immigrants say they are returning now because many of them
have succeeded as entrepreneurs and have money to spare, because
there are economic opportunities in the increasingly open Indian
economy and because the Hindu nationalist-led government that has
been in power since 1998 is more open to their participation in the
country's affairs.
</P>
<P>
   It has, for example, challenged them to raise the billion
dollars for the IITs that educated them at India's expense before
they went to the United States, where they enriched the American
economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're credible, successful people,'' Rekhi said. ``Many of us
are worth hundreds of millions of dollars. We're available to the
Indian government and we provide a bridge to the United States. I
do fund-raisers at my house for congressmen all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   Examples of these to-and-fro millionaires abound.
</P>
<P>
   There's Desh Deshpande, 49, philanthropist. His high technology
telecommunications company, Sycamore Networks, was listed on the
Nasdaq in October. His net worth has since skyrocketed to $4
billion to $6 billion _ depending, he said, on the stock market and
which day the money gets counted. He and his wife plan to give $100
million over 20 years to their alma mater, IIT in Madras.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is that emotional tie,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Pradeep Singh, 42, a graduate of IIT, New Delhi, said his
``lottery ticket came through'' during 8 years as  manager earning
stock options at Microsoft. He quit in the mid-1990s to start his
own company, Aditi, that provides customer service via e-mail from
India for corporations abroad. He now has two companies, lives 4
months a year in Bangalore, 8 months in Seattle, and employs 600
people _ 350 of them in India.
</P>
<P>
   ``My Dad died recently,'' he said. ``He was proud of what I did
overseas, but that was nothing like what he felt about what I've
done here. He clipped all the stories.''
</P>
<P>
   And there's Rakesh Mathur, 43, a graduate of IIT, Bombay. He and
three other Indians founded the Silicon Valley company, Junglee.com
_ the original comparison shopping engine on the Web. The company
was sold in 1998 to Amazon.com in a stock deal that has made Mathur
$90 million richer.
</P>
<P>
   He still has homes in Mountain View, Calif. and Seattle, but
last year he also bought one in Pune. He has given $1 million to
his alma mater and started a new company, Purpleyogi.com, with
offices in Bangalore and Mountain View.
</P>
<P>
   On a recent visit to Bombay, he ventured back to the 500-acre
IIT campus here, driving down a grand main road lined by towering
bottle palms and past the new Kanwal Rekhi School of Information
Technology now under construction, named for the American-made
Indian philanthropist.
</P>
<P>
   For Mathur, who has the casual style of a Californian, it was a
double homecoming. He went to college here and grew up on the
campus because his father was a professor. He was back to visit a
troika of ambitious IIT students who are determined to get rich off
the Internet _ and who had succeeded in making him their mentor.
</P>
<P>
   Over 10-cent cups of coffee at a little outdoor cafe on campus,
these young men had hatched their ideas, then pursued Mathur
whenever he visited the campus and skipped a week of classes once
to meet with him when he was in Delhi.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're different than our classmates because we realized
there's opportunity here in India,'' said Kashyap Deorah, 20.
</P>
<P>
   Graduates of the IITs _ which are far harder to get into than
Harvard _ have formed a transcontinental good-old-boy network (most
of the students are still male) that connects Bombay, Bangalore and
Hyderabad to Silicon Valley, Seattle and Boston.
</P>
<P>
   The IITs themselves are among the few institutions in India that
are still seen as meritocracies, unsullied by political influence.
Admission is based solely on a grueling national entrance exam.
Last year, of the 98,000 students who took it, only 3,000 won
admission.
</P>
<P>
   And the United States continues to exert a magnetic pull on
Indian students and other Indian professionals. Last year, a third
of the 115,000 visas the United States issued to skilled workers
went to Indians.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can I be frank?'' asked Suman Kar, a 20-year-old senior at IIT
Bombay, as he explained why he has accepted a job in Silicon
Valley. ``It's the money.''
</P>
<P>
   Kar said his new job will pay about $60,000 a year, 7 times what
he would have earned here.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   IIT graduates have been the most sought after Indians in Silicon
Valley _ and Indians there have done very well, indeed. AnnaLee
Saxenian, an economist at Berkeley, documented in an analysis of a
Dun &AMP; Bradstreet database that 750 companies there are run by
Indians. Those companies produce more than $3.5 billion in sales
and employ more than 16,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   And as Indians have risen to positions of influence in corporate
suites throughout the American economy, they have played a crucial
role in giving credibility to business people based in India who
are selling software services to U.S. companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the Indian guy comes knocking at your door, selling
something, the first thought on your mind isn't snakes and
elephants,'' said Singh, formerly of Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   Exports of software from India have been growing by more than 50
percent a year in the 1990s as businesses here have found a niche
in employing high-skilled, low-wage computer engineers in India to
write computer code for businesses abroad.
</P>
<P>
   The industry now employs 280,000 people and is expected to have
$4 billion in revenues this year, the majority from sales to
American companies, according to the New Delhi-based National
Association of Software and Service Companies.
</P>
<P>
   Saxenian had once thought that few of them would take their
money or themselves back to India, but a recent visit to Bangalore
changed her view.
</P>
<P>
   She ran into an Indian entrepreneur from the valley, Sanjay
Anandaram, and learned that he had returned to help start a new
company that will develop and finance Indian technology ventures _
and he was not exceptional.
</P>
<P>
   ``Change is happening fast,'' she said. ``At every level, you
see personal and business connections to India that were not there
even two years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   The declining financial situation of the IITs is one of the
factors drawing them back. In 1993, the government cut its funding
of the IITs and for the first time allowed individuals to donate
money directly to the institutes. The alumni in the United States
have given most of the millions raised so far for the IIT in
Bombay. The Indus Entrepreneurs, a group founded by Indians in
Silicon Valley, has been instrumental in raising the money.
</P>
<P>
   Economists who had once seen the brain drain as harmful, now see
the diaspora it has spawned as a source of strength to developing
countries.
</P>
<P>
   ``The emigres often work as a Trojan horse, lobbying on your
behalf,'' said a Columbia University economics professor, Jagdish
Bhagwati, himself a native of India. ``They use external
opportunities to succeed prodigiously in different occupations. And
they can bring their skills and funds home to assist the country in
its economic take-off.''
</P>
<P>
   Mathur, the Web entrepreneur, is such a person. He wants to do
something for India, he said, because it interests him.
</P>
<P>
   The three IIT students he advises came up with an idea that
caught his imagination. On his recent visit, they formally
presented their proposal for a Web site called iportia.com. _ the
contents were still a trade secret _ in a conference room in a
downtown Bombay hotel.
</P>
<P>
   Mathur and another prominent IIT graduate, Nandan M. Nilekani,
chief operating officer of Infosys Technologies, and Deepak B.
Phatak, head of the computer science department at the IIT in
Bombay, listened attentively.
</P>
<P>
   When the students finished, the older men asked them to leave
the room, then considered whether to make this the university's
first attempt to incubate a student business that it would partly
own.
</P>
<P>
   The students stood outside waiting nervously. Would Mathur put
up the $250,000 on the university's behalf that would let them make
their dream real?
</P>
<P>
   After a half hour, the students were summoned back. The
grown-ups had decided that the young men had a great idea so simple
it could be expressed in five words, yet so sophisticated that it
would generate an entire Web world.
</P>
<P>
   The grinning students took turns shaking hands with Mathur, who
turned to the IIT professor, and exclaimed, ``Phatak, Sahib, they
have to make at least $100 million for you!''

RESEARCHERS SHRINK TUMORS USING VACCINE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD SALTUS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   German researchers have dramatically shrunk advanced tumors in
some kidney cancer patients using a vaccine strategy developed at
Dana-Farber Cancer Institute &UR;  &LR; in Boston. Institute scientists say
they are launching similar trials here.
</P>
<P>
   The vaccine, which spurred the patients' immune systems to
attack their tumors, eliminated cancers that had spread to other
organs in 4 of 17 patients, says a report being published Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Two other patients had partial shrinkage of their cancers and in
another patient, some cancerous lesions shrank while others
continued to progress.
</P>
<P>
   Remarkably, the potent anti-cancer action of the vaccine caused
no serious adverse effects, says the report Nature Medicine. The
lead author is Dr. Alexander Kugler, a urological surgeon at the
University of Gottingen.
</P>
<P>
   Kugler said in an interview that a total of 23 patients have now
been treated (six of them since the report was written) and that
the cancer has been eliminated in five. Those patient have gone as
long as 20 months without their cancer returning, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Buoyed by the results, DFCI researchers have already launched a
trial of the vaccine in breast cancer, another for malignant
melanoma and are planning one for kidney cancer.
</P>
<P>
   The impressive results are a shot in the arm for cancer
vaccines, which, unlike those that prevent infectious diseases, are
targeted at an existing cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Many cancer vaccines are under development and all have the same
goal: to make the cancer cells more ``visible'' to the body's
immune system, and to stir up a strong immune response against the
tumor. But few vaccine candidates have thus far lived up to their
promising early results.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the small number of patients, the impressive outcomes
will need confirmation in larger studies before the vaccine can be
considered a promising candidate for clinical use, said the
researchers from The University of Gottingen and other
institutions.
</P>
<P>
   Already, however, a Boston-area biotech company has obtained an
option to license the method exclusively from DFCI. A spokeswoman
for Genzyme Molecular Oncology of Framingham said the company is
sponsoring a trial of the vaccine in breast cancer at Beth Israel
Deaconess Medical Center.
</P>
<P>
   The reported experiments were the first human trials of the
vaccine approach, which was developed in the laboratory of Dr.
Donald Kufe at DFCI and tested in animals in 1997. Kufe, in a
commentary published along with the Nature Medicine report, said
that if the effectiveness of the vaccine is confirmed, it could
mean an ``unprecedented advance'' in treating life-threatening
cancers that have spread beyond their original site.
</P>
<P>
   To make the vaccine, researchers surgically removed the
patients' kidney tumors and combined some of those cells with
immune cells extracted from blood donors. The immune cells, called
dendritic cells, were fused with the tumor cells by passing an
electric current through them.
</P>
<P>
   The result: a ``hybrid'' immune cell that could recognize the
patient's specific tumor cells when injected back into the body.
The hybrid vaccine cells strongly stimulated the patient's immune
defenses to seek out and break apart the cancer cells wherever they
had traveled inside the body.
</P>
<P>
   One reason previous vaccines have failed is that scientists
couldn't find identifying structures, or antigens, on the surface
of cancer cells so that the immune system could recognize them as
the enemy. Instead of trying to identify what antigens marked the
kidney cancer cells, the scientists simply fused the entire cell
with the immune system cell, so that the cancer cell ``taught'' the
immune cells how to identify the cancers.
</P>
<P>
   Commenting on the German research, Dr. David Berd, a cancer
vaccine researcher at Thomas Jefferson University in Philadelphia
called it ``a very nice piece of work and I find it extremely
interesting.''
</P>
<P>
   He added that it confirms his belief that the most promising
cancer vaccines are those tailored to each patient by using cells
from his or her own cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Whether this vaccine is better than many others under
development can't be said at this point, added Berd, who said he
had recently reviewed the literature on cancer vaccines.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of vaccines that seem to produce regression of
metastases (cancers that have spread) in some percentage of
patients in small trials,'' said the researcher in an interview,
but few of them have been validated in larger studies.
</P>
<P>
   One of the unsolved questions facing Kufe and the German
researchers is why the vaccine proved so potent in some patients
yet achieved no results in other patients. Kufe said that issue is
being investigated. ``We can make the vaccines better,'' he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ When it comes to business, John Grisham provides no
suspense. Each February he turns out a novel with a first printing
of 2.8 million copies. Instantly it becomes the nation's No. 1 best
seller; movies, paperbacks, and foreign editions follow apace.
</P>
<P>
   His 11 novels, from ``A Time to Kill'' in 1988 (a two-year
hiatus followed) to ``The Brethren'' just the other day, have added
up to some 90 million Grisham works in circulation, kept him on
best-seller lists for hundreds of weeks and brought in a worldwide
gross of upwards of $1 billion. By comparison, popular producers
like Michael Crichton, Danielle Steele and Tom Clancy are barely
making do.
</P>
<P>
   The only uncertainty about the Grisham enterprise seems to be
whether he may be overproducing. In a 1998 interview with
Publishers Weekly, he recalled a period when ``The Chamber'' was
the No. 1 hardback seller; ``The Firm,'' ``The Pelican Brief'' and
``A Time to Kill'' were the No. 1, 2 and 3 paperbacks respectively;
and a movie version of ``The Client'' had lately hit the theaters.
</P>
<P>
   ``We talked a lot about overexposure,'' he said, ``and worried a
lot about it and still do.''
</P>
<P>
   Happily for Doubleday, his hardcover publisher, and for Dell,
his paperback publisher, his concern has not slowed him down or
discouraged his customers.
</P>
<P>
   The Grisham audience, however, does have its boundaries. He is
not among the heavy hitters of literary entertainment, like Graham
Greene or John le Carre, but is several cuts above the sex and
violence purveyors. Although he's unlikely to inspire many term
papers, no one need be ashamed to carry the latest Grisham in its
own dust jacket. In some circles his books make for elevated
dinner-party conversation. Trying to fathom the Grisham magic, I
have lately gone through five of his works. Grisham's specialty is
the legal thriller; if he did not create the genre, he assuredly
gave it a new dimension.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Brethren,'' for the latest example, has to do with three
felonious former judges who operate a blackmail scheme from inside
a federal prison and find themselves involved in a presidential
campaign. The plot is as up-to-date as tomorrow's newspaper, with
allusions to presidential polls and debates, campaign financing,
money laundering and offshore financial finagling and the
stockpiling of plutonium by Russian hardliners. Add to those
tantalizing ingredients the steady action, with some clever
surprises and occasional interludes for recapitulation or a touch
of romance or humor (not Grisham's strongest suit) or just to fill
360 pages.
</P>
<P>
   You get a rush of events without undue regard for plausibility;
an easy-to-take prose style that is not likely to strain readers
but evidently keeps millions awake; and characters who do not run
deep but are constantly on the run, conspiring and being conspired
against in atmospheric locales around the world as they contribute
to plots that have a ring of relevance without the distractions of
reality. The violence is mild by today's standards, and the sex
tends to be friendly and politely veiled.
</P>
<P>
   To judge by the blurbs that adorn the paperback editions, the
books' main appeal is those unstoppable plots. Here are a few plugs
for ``The Firm'': ``The accelerating tempo of paranoia-driven
events is wonderful''; ``Reads like the whirlwind''; ``Keeps the
reader hooked''; ``Gripping''; ``A mean and lean page turner.''
</P>
<P>
   The catchy openings live up to the advertising. Last year's
entry, ``The Testament,'' begins with the 10th richest man in the
United States jumping to his death after disinheriting his large
and distasteful family and leaving his fortune to a little-known
daughter who is a missionary in an exceedingly remote South
American jungle. What with three greedy ex-wives, six children and
nine sets of lawyers (``the fees would be enormous''), Grisham is
off and running. But the terrain proves tough. I regret to report
that much of ``The Testament'' turns out to be an interminable
journey down Brazil way by Nate O'Reilly, a lawyer with a spiritual
thirst. Bring on the scoundrels, please.
</P>
<P>
   The books benefit from Grisham's own experience as a lawyer, the
legal give-and-get providing a veneer of authenticity, whether the
players are advocates for the homeless or Supreme Court justices or
straight-out crooks. New characters appear whenever a lapse
threatens the action, among them a sprinkling of millionaires and
masterminds.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Brethren'' features a superbrilliant CIA chief with access
to incalculable secret funds that he uses to elect a president who
will be sufficiently combative toward the Russians. Unfortunately,
this CIA chief was not in office during ``The Pelican Brief,'' when
the CIA was hard put to track down the bad guys.
</P>
<P>
   The far-fetched yet controlled plots invite a sort of boys'
magazine writing known among reviewers as ``page turners.'' In
``The Pelican Brief'' the introduction of the terrorist Khamel
tells of ``a man of many names and faces and languages, an assassin
who struck quickly and left no trail, a fastidious killer who
roamed the world but could never be found.'' No, it's not Sherlock
Holmes' nightmare, Moriarty.
</P>
<P>
   This Grisham creation is credited with accomplishments that one
may recall (or imagine he recalls) from the newspapers: ``The
ambush of 17 Israeli soldiers on the West Bank in 1990 ... the 1985
car-bomb murders of a wealthy German banker and his family ... the
1981 attempt to kill the pope.'' Having been thus prepared, the
reader is informed that ``Khamel was about to perform on American
soil,'' and that ``important blood was about to be shed.''
</P>
<P>
   Although such passages lend themselves to rapid scanning,
dismissing them as junk food does not quite do them justice. The
figure of Khamel _ ``He can kill with either hand, either foot, a
car key, a pencil, whatever'' _ must remind many readers of their
excitement on first learning of master criminals and sleuths
engaged in desperate conflicts in exotic places like the Balkans.
What young reader of vulnerable imagination has not been hooked and
ensnared, gripped and propelled by such tales?
</P>
<P>
   Grisham adds to these fond memories contemporary references that
may give the grown-up reader the impression that he is getting the
dirt on how things really work at the highest levels of government,
finance and the legal profession.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
   Consider the nasty doings that young Mitch McDeere of ``The
Firm'' finds himself involved with after getting a cushy job at the
seemingly respectable but thoroughly corrupt offices of Bendini,
Lambert &AMP; Locke, or what happens to Michael Brock of ``The Street
Lawyer'' when he unearths a murderous conspiracy at his giant
Washington law firm of Drake &AMP; Sweeney, or the revelations in ``The
Pelican Brief,'' my favorite in my recent sampling, about the
unscrupulous types who run high-powered White &AMP; Blazevich.
</P>
<P>
   Grisham keeps confirming the outsider's worst notions about
lawyers: ``Before the funeral arrangements were complete, the
lawyers were calling.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
   So the elements are in place each February for another Grisham
smash hit.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Brethren'' introduces those three former judges who have
wound up in that prison, from which they are extorting tens of
thousands of dollars from gays still in closets. The descriptions
are more colorful than the judges' personalities. ``Two of them
wore shoes. One was eating a saltine. The one with no shoes was
also bare-legged up to his knees, so that below his robe his
spindly legs could be seen. They were smooth and hairless and very
brown from the sun. A large tattoo had been applied to his left
calf.'' As the book's disclaimer puts it, ``Any resemblance to
actual persons, living or dead, is entirely coincidental.''
</P>
<P>
   Chapter 2 brings on the CIA chief, Teddy Maynard, an eminence
grise in a wheelchair who selects a Congressman, Aaron Lake, to be
America's next president. Little does Maynard, who knows
everything, know that Lake subscribes to gay publications and so is
a target of the ex-judges. We are thus readied for a conflict that
brings in an army of CIA officers, a drunk of a lawyer, Caribbean
bankers and assorted criminals and victims.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Brethren'' became No. 1 upon appearance a couple of weeks
ago and is now bringing prosperity to bookstores everywhere. As a
blurb is bound to put it, ``The pages fly by.'' My Grisham
adventure was not painful, but I confess that I allowed quite a
number of those pages to fly by unread.

CONTROVERSIAL REPORTER BEING FLOWN TO MOSCOW 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRIAN WHITMORE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Radio Liberty reporter Andrei Babitsky, whose frank war
reporting from Chechnya angered the Kremlin, was put on a
Moscow-bound plane from Dagestan Monday night, perhaps ending a
mysterious six-week ordeal of disappearance and detention.
</P>
<P>
   It was not clear whether Russian authorities planned to release
the reporter or transfer him to detention in Moscow. However, his
return to the Russian capital was announced hours after acting
President Vladimir V. Putin said he thought Babitsky should be
freed.
</P>
<P>
   Babitsky's wife, Lyudmila, and his lawyer _ both of whom were in
Dagestan's capital Makhachkala to seek Babitsky's release _ were
not informed of the flight. Earlier in the day, the two announced
that the reporter was on a hunger strike to protest his continued
detention.
</P>
<P>
   According to televised reports, Babitsky's flight left
Makhachkala at 8:25 p.m., but several hours later he had not
surfaced in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   Babitsky's cause has been taken up by journalists, human rights
organizations and foreign governments, who have expressed fear that
the crusading reporter's plight was a prelude to a wider crackdown
on free speech in Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Babitsky's colleagues at the US-funded Radio Liberty slammed the
move as the latest in a series of actions by the Kremlin designed
to harass the journalist.
</P>
<P>
   Savik Shuster, Radio Liberty's Moscow Bureau Chief, said it was
``unethical'' to fly Babitsky back to Moscow without informing his
wife. ``It shows the inhuman lengths that the authorities are
prepared to go to.''
</P>
<P>
   Babitsky, 35, disappeared on Jan. 15 from Grozny, Chechnya's
capital. After denying any knowledge of his whereabouts for two
weeks, Moscow announced that Russian forces had detained him for
lacking journalistic accreditation and on suspicion of
collaborating with the Chechen rebels.
</P>
<P>
   The Kremlin later provoked international outrage when it said
Babitsky had been turned over to Chechen rebels on Feb. 2 in
exchange for Russian prisoners of war.
</P>
<P>
   Babitsky surfaced last Friday after being detained by police in
Makhachkala, capital of the Russian province of Dagestan, which
borders Chechnya. On Sunday prosecutors there charged him with
carrying a false passport.
</P>
<P>
   Babitsky's wife Lyudmila, who met with her husband for the first
time since his disappearance, was shocked by the news that he had
been moved to Moscow without her knowledge.
</P>
<P>
   ``I suppose I will fly back to Moscow. I keep trying to see my
husband and they keep moving him someplace else,'' she said in a
televised interview.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't say he is free,'' she said. ``They put him on some
special airplane. They didn't say anything. As far as I am
concerned, until he is home he isn't free.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the day, Putin, who previously said little about the
case, announced that he thought Babitsky should be freed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think that law-enforcement bodies should be holding
him behind bars,'' Putin said in televised comments. ``If they have
some questions to put to him they should sort them out without
keeping him under arrest,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Putin said he thought Babitsky's reporting from Chechnya was
biased, but added that this was not sufficient cause to incarcerate
him. Babitsky's reports had infuriated the Kremlin by focusing on
the plight of suffering civilians and high Russian troop losses.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, details of Babitsky's plight over the past six weeks
have begun to emerge.
</P>
<P>
   Oleg Kusov, a Radio Liberty reporter in the Caucasus who spent
several hours with Babitsky Friday night, said that after the
journalist was detained, he was taken to a detention center at
Chernokozovo, an infamous ``filtration camp'' for suspected Chechen
rebels located 30 miles north of Grozny. Media and human rights
groups have accused Russian authorities of torturing prisoners held
in the camp.
</P>
<P>
   Kusov said Babitsky revealed little about what he saw at
Chernokozovo, other than that he wasn't tortured himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``He did not want to talk about that, not because he himself
underwent some kind of physical difficulties, but he saw how other
people, Chechens and women, were suffering,'' Kusov said in an
interview broadcast on Radio Liberty on Saturday. ``The topic is
not very pleasant for him.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Kusov's account, after Russians turned him over to
unidentified men wearing ski masks, Babitsky was taken to a home in
Chechnya and held there until Friday when men in masks brought him
to Makhachkala.

 &HT;    Bass to buy Bristol Hotels in deal worth $157 million
 &HT;    By Shelia M. Poole
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Bass PLC announced a deal Monday to buy Dallas-based
Bristol Hotels &AMP; Resorts Inc. for $9.50 a share, or $157 million.
</P>
<P>
   Bass already owns 9.9 percent of Bristol, which leases or
manages 112 hotels, most of them Holiday Inns. Bristol is also the
largest operator of Bass Hotels &AMP; Resorts properties in the world.
</P>
<P>
   The $9.50 a share Bass will pay for outstanding Bristol stock is
65 percent more than the company's closing price of $5.75 on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The deal has been approved by the Bristol board and is awaiting
shareholder approval. United/Harvey Holdings, which owns 39 percent
of Bristol's stock, has entered an agreement with Bass to accept
the offer. Bristol officials could not be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Bass owns the Holiday Inn, Inter-Continental and Crowne Plaza
brands. The company's North American headquarters is in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas R. Oliver, chairman and chief executive of Bass Hotels &AMP;
Resorts, said the company sees ``significant growth prospects''
because of the marriage of strong brands and an expert management
system. ``Adding Bristol to our company effectively makes us one of
the leading hotel operators across all segments of the industry,''
he said.

HEALTH WEB SITES MAY BE TRADING DATA 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KAREN HSU  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Some of the most popular consumer sites on the Internet that
dispense medical information may be exchanging personal data about
users who visit there, in possible violation of antitrust laws,
consumer and government officials say.
</P>
<P>
   The sites, which often rely heavily on surveys visitors are
asked to fill out online, gather a wealth of information on the
health, medical history, prescription drug use, and other personal
information. Most of that information is given up voluntarily by
visitors to the site, but some of it is not, and few users realize
that the information could be traded or sold to other Internet
health-care sites.
</P>
<P>
   Several recent studies have confirmed that personal data is
being captured and exchanged with other companies, and the Federal
Trade Commission is reportedly investigating.
</P>
<P>
   Richard M. Smith, a noted Internet security specialist, said he
nearly fell out of his chair when he found out a medical Web site,
PersonalMD.com, had given his ZIP code to an advertiser on the site
without his permission or knowledge. He wouldn't have realized it
had he not known how to check the background coding instructions
for the Web page. An internal program apparently knew who to access
the information off Smith's computer and send it to the advertiser,
Doubleclick.com.
</P>
<P>
   ``Usually sites are more subtle about what they send out,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   As the number of various Web sites has exploded, including
17,000 health-oriented sites that sell products and conduct
interactive health surveys, the whole area of privacy has not kept
pace, Smith said. Some sites include services such as keeping
entire medical records online or sending medication reminders.
</P>
<P>
   Smith and others worked on a report commissioned by the
California Health Care Foundation that was released a month ago.
The report focused on privacy with 21 of the most popular health
Web sites, and found that many of them violated their own privacy
policies.
</P>
<P>
   One of the Web sites highlighted in the report was OnHealth
Network Co, which offered a survey called a Personal Health
Assessment. But what OnHealth didn't inform users was that an
outside vendor called WellMed collected the information for the
survey.
</P>
<P>
   ``OnHealth intentionally tried to hide the role of WellMed in
all this. So you are typing in all this data, which is immediately
going off to another company that you don't have a relationship
with,'' Smith said. After the report came out, the Personal Health
Assessment survey was discontinued.
</P>
<P>
   To add confusion last week, OnHealth was bought by
Healtheon/WebMD Corp., another Internet health-care company. A
spokeswoman for WebMD said that the OnHealth Web site will
eventually merge into WebMD.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't know who owns the data anymore,'' said Zoe Hudson,
senior policy analyst at Georgetown University's Health Privacy
Project who was a co-author of the report. ``You thought you gave
the information to OnHealth, but now it's changing hands. This
merger may not concern the consumer, but it might matter if one of
those sites joined forces with their insurance company.''
</P>
<P>
   Hudson said that because health sites ask for more detailed
information than many other sites, she expected that the privacy
protection would be better. ``We were all surprised at the amount
that was leaving the site,'' Hudson said.
</P>
<P>
   According to another study of 1,009 US adults by the California
Health Care Foundation in January, it found 75 percent of them
concerned about health Web sites sharing information without their
permission. Some sites currently collect information such as Social
Security numbers, credit card numbers, lab results and insurance
information.
</P>
<P>
   Since the report come out, a few companies, including
HealthCentral.com and iVillage.com, have said that the FTC has
inquired about their privacy practices. In addition, industry and
government leaders have met to work on privacy Internet issues. In
1996, a coalition of ethicists, physicians and online providers
formed the Internet Healthcare Coalition, which recently endorsed a
draft of an International e-Health Code of Ethics. Another group of
for-profit health providers have also formed a group called
Hi-Ethics Alliance.
</P>
<P>
   Representatives of both groups and Smith were in Washington last
Friday to testify before a Congressional subcomittee on privacy and
confidentiality about health Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do think that in the spring, we will be seeing a lot more
activity in self-regulation with privacy,'' said John Mack,
president of the Internet Healthcare Coalition.
</P>
<P>
   ``Privacy is a big issue for us. If we lose consumers' trust,
then we have lost the site,'' said Laura Hicks, a spokeswoman for
drkoop.com, which was profiled in Smith's report.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's sort of unexpected that we are being monitored and
watched in this way. We think it's like a newspaper or a magazine,
but it's much more invasive,'' said Smith, who warns that it is
possible to put together a profile of a user from all the
information gathered by different companies.
</P>
<P>
   Since the report, some e-health companies are already changing
or clarifying their policies. For example, drkoop.com said that it
has rewritten the privacy policy so it is more consumer-friendly.
It has added information, such as how servers keep logs of sites.

 &HT;    Union trying to organize attacks Delta drug tests
 &HT;    By Scott Thurston
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ A flight attendants union trying to organize at Delta
Air Lines is calling on the carrier to reinstate at least a
half-dozen attendants its says were fired because of flawed drug
tests.
</P>
<P>
   Delta's random drug tests are ``resulting in false accusations
of adulteration of urine samples,'' said Patricia Friend, president
of the Association of Flight Attendants.
</P>
<P>
   Clay McConnell, a spokesman for Atlanta-based Delta, declined to
respond directly but defended the drug-testing program.
</P>
<P>
   ``We regret that anyone's been terminated,'' he said. ``But both
Delta and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services have
examined the science behind this policy and found it to be
completely sound.''
</P>
<P>
   At issue are random drug tests given operational airline
employees to assure safety. Last year Delta fired Yasuko Ishikawa,
based in Portland, Ore., after she submitted a urine sample
following a flight. It was judged ``not consistent with human
urine.''
</P>
<P>
   The AFA says Ishikawa's habit of drinking lots of water during
flights, along with her small size, led to a false finding of a
substituted sample.
</P>
<P>
   The union says the effect of those factors, as well as gender,
ethnicity and diet, haven't been fully tested. It wants the U.S.
Transportation Department to revise testing guidelines.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to Delta Chairman Leo Mullin, Friend said at least
six and as many as 13 Delta attendants have been fired for such
findings. She added the union is aware of only three such firings
among the 47,000 attendants it represents at 26 other carriers.
</P>
<P>
   McConnell pointed to a recently released HHS report, prepared at
Delta's request, that supports the scientific guidelines used to
determine if a sample is a substitute. The report said studies of
more than 2,600 diverse people, including some who
``water-loaded,'' produced ``not a single person'' who tested
falsely for a substituted sample.
</P>
<P>
   McConnell said Delta uses federally certified labs for drug test
results. He said Delta has tested 14,000 employees since October
1998, with 11 findings of substituted or adulterated samples.
</P>
<P>
   The AFA is seeking to organize Delta's 20,000 flight attendants
and in recent months has used the drug-testing issue in fliers.

   He's 65 now, an age when most men of his income and professional
stature are busy polishing their golf swings or bouncing their
grandkids on wobbly knees.
</P>
<P>
   But what's a sexagenarian sex symbol to do? Richard Chamberlain
can't help it if some middle-age women regress to giggling girlhood
whenever he steps on stage or screen, as he'll be doing this week
in a Broadway-nurtured revival of Richard Rodgers and Oscar
Hammerstein III's ``The Sound of Music'' at the Pantages Theatre in
Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   Directed by Susan H. Schulman, the production has been hailed by
critics as an inspired restaging of the romantic musical based on
the true story of a feisty Austrian postulant, Maria Rainer, who
brings out the kinder, gentler side of an authoritarian Navy
captain.
</P>
<P>
   For many, however, the real draw won't be the story or the
music, but Chamberlain, the absurdly well-preserved leading man who
has been eliciting sighs ever since he was cast as TV's Dr. Kildare
nearly 40 years ago. His female admirers are still out there and,
to judge by the fan mail he receives, scarcely less devoted than
before.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mostly they say they love the show and they were very touched
by it and they loved `The Thorn Birds,''' says Chamberlain,
speaking by phone. ``They're very sweet letters.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Thornbirds,'' of course, was the 1983 TV mini-series based
on Colleen McCullough's best-seller in which Chamberlain played the
dashing, if spiritually anguished, Father Ralph de Bricassart. It
was one of several roles, along with ``Shogun'' and the title part
in ``Wallenberg,'' that confirmed Chamberlain as the champ of the
TV miniseries, as well as one of America's most bankable middle-age
heartthrobs.
</P>
<P>
   After four decades in show biz, Chamberlain is able to wear
those credentials comfortably, minus any self-consciousness.
</P>
<P>
   Polished, yet candid and opinionated, the actor is quick to
attribute ``The Sound of Music's'' enduring appeal to its
squeaky-clean '60s sensibility and PG-13 subject matter _ no matter
that it takes place during the Nazis' annexation of Austria.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I know is the audiences adore the show, they just love
the show, and then people say, `What do they love about the show,'
and it's very hard to say apart from its obvious fun and gaiety and
the children and all that,'' Chamberlain says. ``It seems to me
that it reminds us of a vision of a life that we all had, when love
and marriages lasted forever, when kids didn't carry weapons to
school and probably weren't addicted to heroin. Now, times were
dark; the Nazis were on the march. But there was something about
the way people were. I do think it's this memory of a simpler
time.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether due to nostalgia or simply a slew of hummable tunes like
``My Favorite Things,'' ``Do-Re-Mi'' and ``Climb Ev'ry Mountain,''
the show has been a hit from Nov. 16, 1959, when it opened at
Broadway's Lunt-Fontanne Theatre and went on to run for 1,443
performances. That original production won seven Tony Awards, Best
Musical among them, before spawning the Oscar-winning 1965 film
version, the top-grossing movie musical of all time.
</P>
<P>
   While other Rodgers and Hammerstein shows such as ``Carousel''
and ``Oklahoma!'' lately have received revisionist remountings _
mostly at the hands of British directors _ ``The Sound of Music''
has been left largely untouched. This production reportedly seeks
to add some faux-Alpine flavor to the score by augmenting the
orchestra's brass section. It also restores two songs from the
Broadway version that were cut from the film, ``How Can Love
Survive?'' and ``There's No Way to Stop It,'' while including two
songs from the film, ``I Have Confidence'' and the love duet
``Something Good.''
</P>
<P>
   But for the most part the production leaves the original show
intact. Which is fine with Chamberlain.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's unrevisable,'' he says. ``I think they hit it
just right ... and I can't imagine it being done much
differently.''
</P>
<P>
   Fair enough, but how does that affect his playing of Capt. Georg
von Trapp, a character initially so wooden that he seems to be
suffering from dry rot?
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, he starts out that way for sure,'' Chamberlain says,
``that's part of the fun of playing him, but then he loosens up a
lot, a lot happens to him, a lot more than I realized before I
started playing him. Things happen very fast in musicals and
they're written in a kind of shorthand, which is what makes them
very difficult to play.''
</P>
<P>
   It's evident from the conversation how thoroughly Chamberlain
has considered his character, including the source of his
attraction to ``The Sound of Music's'' Other Woman, the Captain's
fiancee, Elsa Schrader.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, she's gorgeous for one thing, and I think they have a
sexual relationship that's pretty good,'' Chamberlain ventures.
``She's a very, very attractive woman and I think if Maria hadn't
come along they would've gotten married and would've had a pretty
good marriage.''
</P>
<P>
   Chamberlain is equally animated in discussing his young co-star,
Meg Tolin, who previously played Eliza Doolittle to his Henry
Higgins in the 1993 revival of ``My Fair Lady.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're great friends and she's very, very talented.''
</P>
<P>
   And is the age difference between them an issue in the
production?
</P>
<P>
   `Well, it's not an issue for me!'' he says, laughing. ``I feel
very young doing this thing!''
</P>
<P>
   A resident of Hawaii for many years, Chamberlain was born and
grew up in Los Angeles. Though he returns here frequently on
business, he admits to holding some strongly negative feelings
about his hometown.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not too fond of L.A.,'' he says. ``I have some great
friends there, but the (entertainment) business is very tough and
the town itself gives me the feeling of one of the places that is
about pure materialism. It's so important there what you drive, and
people walking down Rodeo Drive ...
</P>
<P>
   ``There's something about the values of the town that I find
very seductive, and when I'm in town I start to slowly kind of
bring them back into my life again. And I find I don't have that in
Hawaii, or in New York, for that matter.''
</P>
<P>
   These days, Chamberlain maintains his equilibrium by wave
watching, exercising and painting (an exhibition of his work is on
view through March at Wolfry Selway Fine Art gallery, 8678 Melrose
Ave. in West Hollywood).
</P>
<P>
   He also has taken to heart a line that Father Ralph speaks in
``The Thorn Birds.'' Roughly translated, it has to do with the idea
that no gift in life is given without a cost.
</P>
<P>
   ``The more I think about it, the more obviously true it is. I
mean, you might have a billion dollars tomorrow, but, please! If
you have children you're missing freedom, and if you have freedom
you're missing children. So there's always something.''
</P>
<P>
   The perpetual bachelor bears that thought in mind when he's on
the road for long tours like this one.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been watching myself with, `Oh my God, I wish I were back
in Hawaii, and what am I doing in this hotel room?'''
</P>
<P>
   But now, he says, he's been learning how to enjoy reality, not
as one might wish it be, but as it exists at a given moment.
</P>
<P>

 &HT;    Union trying to organize attacks Delta drug tests
 &HT;    By Scott Thurston
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ A flight attendants union trying to organize at Delta
Air Lines is calling on the carrier to reinstate at least a
half-dozen attendants its says were fired because of flawed drug
tests.
</P>
<P>
   Delta's random drug tests are ``resulting in false accusations
of adulteration of urine samples,'' said Patricia Friend, president
of the Association of Flight Attendants.
</P>
<P>
   Clay McConnell, a spokesman for Atlanta-based Delta, declined to
respond directly but defended the drug-testing program.
</P>
<P>
   ``We regret that anyone's been terminated,'' he said. ``But both
Delta and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services have
examined the science behind this policy and found it to be
completely sound.''
</P>
<P>
   At issue are random drug tests given operational airline
employees to assure safety. Last year Delta fired Yasuko Ishikawa,
based in Portland, Ore., after she submitted a urine sample
following a flight. It was judged ``not consistent with human
urine.''
</P>
<P>
   The AFA says Ishikawa's habit of drinking lots of water during
flights, along with her small size, led to a false finding of a
substituted sample.
</P>
<P>
   The union says the effect of those factors, as well as gender,
ethnicity and diet, haven't been fully tested. It wants the U.S.
Transportation Department to revise testing guidelines.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to Delta Chairman Leo Mullin, Friend said at least
six and as many as 13 Delta attendants have been fired for such
findings. She added the union is aware of only three such firings
among the 47,000 attendants it represents at 26 other carriers.
</P>
<P>
   McConnell pointed to a recently released HHS report, prepared at
Delta's request, that supports the scientific guidelines used to
determine if a sample is a substitute. The report said studies of
more than 2,600 diverse people, including some who
``water-loaded,'' produced ``not a single person'' who tested
falsely for a substituted sample.
</P>
<P>
   McConnell said Delta uses federally certified labs for drug test
results. He said Delta has tested 14,000 employees since October
1998, with 11 findings of substituted or adulterated samples.
</P>
<P>
   The AFA is seeking to organize Delta's 20,000 flight attendants
and in recent months has used the drug-testing issue in fliers.

STOCKS REBOUND, BUT INTEREST-RATE FEARS REMAIN 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By KENNETH N. GILPIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Dow Jones industrial average rebounded above
10,000 on Monday as investors, at least temporarily, moved back
into blue-chip stocks that had been battered in recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index also gained ground, helped
in part by the Goldman Sachs market strategist Abby Joseph Cohen,
who said Monday that the slide in the index had left it
undervalued.
</P>
<P>
   But technology stocks, which have continued to rise in the face
of a broad-based decline this year, edged lower Monday.
</P>
<P>
   With the economy continuing to power ahead and the Federal
Reserve Board showing no sign that it has finished trying to slow
it down by raising short-term interest rates, most analysts and
traders said Monday's moves were little more than a temporary
bounce from what had been a sharp sell-off.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am happy the market is up, but it would be nice if I had
some reason to think it is sustainable,'' said Henry Herrmann,
chief investment officer at Waddell &AMP; Reed, a firm in Overland
Park, Kan., that has $40 billion under management. ``We are due for
a bounce, and we are getting it.''
</P>
<P>
   Led by financial and retail stocks like Citigroup, American
Express and Procter &AMP; Gamble, the Dow rose 176.53 points, or 1.8
percent, to 10,038.65. It was the biggest point gain in the Dow in
nearly two weeks and came after a 2.3 percent decline on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the S&AMP;P 500 gained 14.69 points, or 1.1 percent, to
1,348.05. Exxon Mobil, Qualcomm and American International Group
helped to lift the index.
</P>
<P>
   But investors took some profits in technology stocks. By the
close, the Nasdaq composite index was down 12.65 points, or 0.3
percent, to 4,577.85. At one point in the session, the index had
fallen as much as 2.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Prices of small-company shares were little changed. The Russell
2000 index gained 0.94, or 0.2 percent, to 557.68.
</P>
<P>
   In her comments Monday, Cohen said the recent slide in the S&AMP;P
500 had left the index about 5 percent undervalued. She maintained
her target of 1,525 for the S&AMP;P 500 by the end of the year because
of continued vigor in the economy and robust corporate profits.
</P>
<P>
   In reference to interest-rate fears, Cohen said recent and
expected interest-rate increases by the Fed are aimed ``at slowing
and elongating, not stopping, economic growth.''
</P>
<P>
   Andrew M. Brooks, head of equity trading at T. Rowe Price
Associates, said, ``Abby's mildly positive comments were a help.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Brooks said Monday's move was mostly ``a snap back from a
pretty ugly week.''
</P>
<P>
   Volume was heavy, but not frantic. On the New York Stock
Exchange, just over a billion shares changed hands. Volume on the
Nasdaq stock market was 1.78 billion shares.
</P>
<P>
   Financial stocks, which have been severely battered as interest
rates have risen, did better Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Citigroup, a Dow component, gained 1 3/8, to 49 3/8, after the
United States' biggest financial services company said John S.
Reed, its co-chairman, would retire in April.
</P>
<P>
   Chase Manhattan gained 2 1/16, to 77 15/16. Wells Fargo rose 1
7/16, to 34 1/8. Mellon Financial was up 1{, to 34}. Bank of New
York closed at 34}, up 1}. And American International Group rose 3
9/16, to 87 3/16.
</P>
<P>
   Cisco Systems, EMC and Oracle were among the technology losers
Monday. Cisco fell 2 3/16, to 130 9/16. EMC shed 5, to 118. Oracle
fell 2, to 68 5/8.
</P>
<P>
   And reports that Yahoo was in talks to take a minority stake in
a company that News Corp. is creating to hold its satellite
television assets sent the stock down 3\, to 161 15/16.

<TEXT>
<P>
   FRANKFURT, Germany _ It is not the future that worries
Rolf-Ernst Breuer, chairman of Deutsche Bank. It is the present.
</P>
<P>
   As chairman of one of the world's biggest banks, Breuer is
convinced that the World Wide Web will eviscerate traditional
banking _ but also open huge new opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, in a cavernous warehouse packed with video screens,
Breuer outlined a number of Web-based projects, from portals for
personal finance to electronic trading networks for steel and
chemicals.
</P>
<P>
   But in a wide-ranging interview in his office at the bank's
headquarters here, Breuer sounded like a man still trapped in
concrete.
</P>
<P>
   Deutsche Bank is struggling to be one of the top five banking
companies in the world, a position it can lay claim to by virtue of
its size, but one that will require big adjustments to the global
marketplace.
</P>
<P>
   Deutsche Bank has 1,500 local offices and 7 million retail
banking customers. It has the biggest branch network in Germany,
but that network barely ekes out a profit and consistently drags
down the bank's overall performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a problem which we cannot solve on a stand-alone
basis,'' he acknowledged bluntly, adding that customers flee as
soon as the bank closes branches. ``The only solution is to
consolidate, which means to go together with someone else and,
well, diminish overlaps.''
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, consolidation would have implied taking over a
rival. But now, Breuer is hinting at something more radical: the
possibility of giving up a controlling stake in his own branches.
</P>
<P>
   ``That depends on the partners,'' he said cagily, when asked
whether he could contemplate letting someone else have a
controlling stake.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is largely beyond Deutsche Bank's control. Germany
has far too many banks partly because it has a huge sector of
nonprofit savings banks owned by state and local governments, which
keep margins low.
</P>
<P>
   Having separated Deutsche Bank's retail network into a
stand-alone company called Deutsche Bank 24, Breuer has pleaded in
vain for rivals to buy in as minority partners.
</P>
<P>
   Few analysts say Deutsche Bank will simply sell off its branch
network. But Breuer is clearly impatient and also seems convinced
that traditional banking is withering and radical changes are
necessary to survive.
</P>
<P>
   ``Deutsche Bank is a lot like Germany,'' said an executive at
one of its rivals in investment banking. ``It moves slowly for a
long time, but when it does decide to change, it moves incredibly
quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   Outlining his strategy for electronic banking, Breuer argued
that the Internet would cannibalize conventional banking channels
and lead to a drastic reduction of profit margins in routine
businesses.
</P>
<P>
   But, Breuer added, the Internet also opens up new opportunities
for geographic expansion across Europe without buying physical
businesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two years ago, if someone had come and offered me the Credit
Lyonnais on a plate, I would have been interested,'' he remarked.
``But today, I would say no, that's duplicating a problem we have
already in Germany.''
</P>
<P>
   France is now a model for building up a virtual market across
Europe. Blocked by French political leaders from buying a French
bank, Breuer set up a skeleton network of offices that cater only
to wealthy customers and rely primarily on electronic services.
</P>
<P>
   Breuer, who took over as chief executive three years ago, knows
he is under pressure. He acknowledges that he is far behind rivals
like Goldman, Sachs and Morgan Stanley Dean Witter as an adviser in
mergers and acquisitions. Even in the German market, Deutsche Bank
has consistently ranked behind both American rivals in making
deals.
</P>
<P>
   He is also behind in electronic banking. Not only is Deutsche
Bank well behind American online brokers like Charles Schwab, it
also has fewer brokerage customers than German rivals like
Commerzbank and ConSors.
</P>
<P>
   At the moment, Deutsche Bank has only 125,000 online brokerage
customers, compared with about 300,000 for ComDirect, a unit of
Commerzbank, and 176,000 for ConSors, an online start-up that has
been one of Germany's hottest stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Despite some tardiness, Breuer now seems determined. He plans to
invest $300 million in Internet projects this year. He also
hammered out alliances with America Online and Europe's biggest
software company, SAP.
</P>
<P>
   In the deal with SAP, Deutsche Bank plans to set up virtual
marketplaces for corporations to trade products like chemicals and
steel.
</P>
<P>
   It is also setting up a number new portal sites that offer
access to investments and advice from Deutsche Bank as well as
other institutions.
</P>
<P>
   None of this is inherently unique. But Breuer has far more money
than most rivals to throw at the project. Bank officials say the
bank's total investment in electronic banking, including the costs
of marketing through its various subsidiaries, could reach $1.4
billion next year.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Most of that money will come from selling assets in Deutsche
Bank's huge portfolio of industrial stocks. Until recently, the
portfolio was almost impossible to touch because the taxes on
capital gains would have run into billions of dollars. But the
German government is now planning to let companies sell their
holdings tax-free, and Breuer plans to be a major seller.
</P>
<P>
   Derek Chambers, a banking analyst at HSBC Securities in London,
argues that the prospect of electronic banking has abruptly
deflated expectations about the merits of full-blown bank mergers
in Germany.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the last three to six months, people are questioning
whether it makes sense to put together brick-and-mortar networks,''
Chambers said. ``What is changing the business most of all right
now is how you reach customers.''
</P>
<P>
   Some industry executives go further, arguing that Deutsche Bank
should simply sell its retail branches and let an independent
company act as a neutral distribution system for rival banks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Given the structure of banking in Germany, there isn't going
to be room for four big private retail banking networks forever,''
said Andreas R. Dombrett, a former Deutsche Bank executive who is
now a managing director in J.P. Morgan's Frankfurt office. ``What
you need to do is break up the value chain between production,
distribution and transaction processing or information
technology.''
</P>
<P>
   In practice, the choices are more difficult. With seven million
customers, Deutsche Bank's retail network is a valuable channel for
selling everything from mutual funds to retirement plans.
</P>
<P>
   At the moment, only about 650,000 of Deutsche Bank's customers
use its online services. According to bank executives, about 20
percent of customers say they do not want electronic banking at
all, while 60 percent want both online services and traditional
branches.
</P>
<P>
   ``We lose clients if we close branches,'' Breuer said, noting
that the customers have already balked about staff reductions. ``We
really stretched the patience of our customers to the acceptable
limit. And although we think we did everything possible,
profitability is not comparable to our British or Spanish
competitors.''
</P>
<P>
   The result is a dilemma: keep the retail network and continue to
drag down the entire bank's profitability, or give it up and risk
losing access to millions of customers.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, Deutsche Bank's corporate and investment banking
businesses have been much stronger than its retail business.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Deutsche Bank greatly expanded its American presence
by acquiring Bankers Trust for $10 billion. Though Deutsche Bank
had to spend hundreds of millions of dollars on bonuses to retain
executives at Bankers Trust, most analysts agree that the merger
went surprisingly well.
</P>
<P>
   Bankers Trust gave Deutsche Bank a solid position in arranging
midsize mergers and securities trading. Bankers Trust also owned
Alex Brown, a small but well-respected investment bank specializing
in technology and health care companies.
</P>
<P>
   Propelled by torrid growth in the world's capital markets,
Deutsche Bank's net income climbed 50 percent in 1999 to 2.6
billion euros (just under $2.6 billion). Its trading revenues
soared 170 percent, to about 4.8 billion euros, and commission
income from financial services climbed 50 percent, to 8.1 billion
euros.
</P>
<P>
   The one real weak spot is retail banking _ the business of
serving ordinary private customers. Although this area generated
about $2.3 billion in revenues last year, analysts estimate that it
earned only $16 million in operating profit, and some experts
believe it barely broke even.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Deutsche Bank shares have nearly doubled from
their 52-week low of 44.06 euros last March 2, to 88.34 euros
Monday. Part of that reflects actual growth, but much of it
reflects excitement that German tax reform will let Deutsche Bank
cash in on billions of dollars from its industrial holdings. The
bank's portfolio is currently worth about $18 billion.
</P>
<P>
   But costs continue to climb as fast as revenues. Despite three
separate cost-cutting plans the last two years, Breuer has made
almost no progress toward his stated goal of reducing costs from
about 75 percent to 65 percent of revenues by 2001.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, the cost performance has been extremely poor,''
said Mark Hoge, a banking analyst at Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette
in London who recently lowered his rating on Deutsche Bank stock to
underperform.
</P>
<P>
   Breuer's preferred answer to the problem thus far has been to
invite other banks in as partners in Deutsche Bank 24.
</P>
<P>
   But that idea has run aground. Dresdner Bank, Germany's
third--largest bank, began talks last year but abruptly called them
off.
</P>
<P>
   Industry executives say the plan ran afoul of Dresdner's biggest
shareholder, the German insurance company Allianz. Allianz is
widely believed to be pushing for a merger between Dresdner and
Hypovereinsbank of Munich, Germany's second-largest bank and one in
which Allianz is also a major shareholder.
</P>
<P>
   That leaves Germany's No. 4, Commerzbank. But its chief

 &HT;    Dow's return to 10,000 fails to impress analysts
 &HT;    By David McNaughton
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The Dow Jones industrial average on Monday popped back
above its psychological benchmark of 10,000.
</P>
<P>
   But investors were cautioned against making too much of that
rebound. They were also urged not to make any sudden investment
decisions based on the twists and turns of the market.
</P>
<P>
   ``Investors have to stick with their long-term strategy,'' said
John K. Lynch, director of investment strategy at Wachovia
Securities. ``Don't get swayed by the day-to-day stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dow, by the way, gained almost 177 points, or 1.79 percent,
on Monday, after losing 230 points Friday. The Nasdaq composite
closed with a decline of less than 13 points, or 0.28 percent.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, the Dow was up 294, on what was widely seen as the
result of investors shifting some money out of technology stocks
and into some of the beaten-down ``old economy'' stocks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it's a watershed event,'' Lynch said before
trading ended for the day. He suggested the Dow, up about 250
points at the time, could just as quickly lose that much if the
monthly employment report due Friday is stronger than expected.
</P>
<P>
   Lynch also noted the movement of money from technology stocks to
industrials has a lopsided effect. Because the market value of some
technology companies is much higher than that of old-line
businesses, a little movement can have a big impact on the Dow, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, investors shouldn't expect the market to settle
down until it's clear the Federal Reserve is done raising interest
rates, he and others said.
</P>
<P>
   The other uncertainty is whether a handful of stocks can
continue to lead major market indexes higher, said money manager
Joe Ransom of Trusco Capital Management, a subsidiary of SunTrust
Banks.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem with looking at the indexes,'' he added, ``is
judging from the indexes what is happening to individual stocks.''
</P>
<P>
   While investors shouldn't try to time the market, Ransom said,
investors can look to the bigger market to help them feel
comfortable as to when to add new money. One signal of a possible
bottom is when bad news stops triggering selling, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Even with the current volatility, the fundamentals are still
good, Ransom said, from the strength of the economy, to the level
of interest rates, to the state of inflation.
</P>
<P>
   ``One can find reason to be very upbeat,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   So can Lynch, of Wachovia Securities. ``I'm still seeing a
13,000 Dow at the end of the year, and 1,675 on the Standard &AMP;
Poor's (500 index).''
</P>
<P>
   His ballpark prediction for the Nasdaq composite is 5,000.
</P>
<P>
   The catalyst for the bullish outlook will be the first-quarter
and second-quarter earnings reports, he said. Lynch expects the
Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 companies to report 15 percent growth in
earnings per share for both quarters.

SUPREME COURT TO CONSIDER LEGALITY OF TESTING PREGNANT WOMEN FOR
DRUGS
</HEADLINE>
 
(Eds. note: budgeted earlier as SCOTUS-MOTHERS-DRUGS)  (Eds: UPDATES throughout with more background, analysis; note
byline change.) 
 (nk) 
 By LINDA GREENHOUSE 
  
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Supreme Court agreed Monday to decide whether a
South Carolina public hospital conducted unconstitutional searches
when it tested pregnant women's urine for drugs so it could report
illegal drug use to the police.
</P>
<P>
   The case is an appeal on behalf of 10 women who sued after being
arrested as a result of the policy, some while they were still weak
and bleeding from childbirth. It presents the Supreme Court a
narrow but important aspect of a legal and public policy debate
that began in the peak years of the crack epidemic of the 1980s:
the extent to which a state may intervene to protect fetal health
and the circumstances under which pregnant women may be held
criminally responsible for behavior that endangers their fetuses.
</P>
<P>
   A federal appeals court ruled last year that while the
urinanalysis was a search, it was not unconstitutional because it
was justified by ``a special need beyond normal law-enforcement
goals,'' namely protecting the health and safety of fetuses and
newborn babies.
</P>
<P>
   In their appeal, lawyers for the women are arguing that this
conclusion amounts to a drastic expansion of what the Supreme Court
has previously treated as a ``special-needs exception'' to the
Fourth Amendment's prohibition against unreasonable searches.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nearly every application of the criminal law serves some
health or safety purpose'' and so could be placed outside the
protection of the Fourth Amendment under this approach, the women's
brief said. The appeal is supported by a coalition of public health
groups, which told the justices that women who need prenatal care
the most will be deterred from seeking it if their drug abuse is
treated not as a medical problem but as a criminal one.
</P>
<P>
   None of the women who filed the lawsuit were actually
prosecuted, and the particular program they are challenging ended
in the mid-1990s, after suits were filed and the U.S. Department of
Health and Human Services began an investigation.
</P>
<P>
   However, Lynn Paltrow, one of the plaintiffs' lawyers and
director of National Advocates for Pregnant Women, a program of the
Women's Law Project in Philadelphia, said Monday that drug testing
of pregnant women remained widespread in South Carolina under the
state Supreme Court's interpretation of the state child
endangerment law as applying not only to children but also to
viable fetuses. The U.S. Supreme Court refused two years ago to
review that state court interpretation.
</P>
<P>
   ``No other state has gone as far as South Carolina,'' Paltrow
said in an interview, adding: ``No other state has made it a crime
to be pregnant and addicted. These women had a health problem and
needed medical care, but they were taken to jail.''
</P>
<P>
   The lead plaintiff in the case, Crystal M. Ferguson, tested
positive for cocaine during a prenatal visit to the hospital at the
Medical University of South Carolina, in Charleston, in June 1991.
She agreed to attend a drug abuse counseling program, but tested
positive again when she gave birth in August. She was arrested
three days later. According to the city's statistics, 30 women were
arrested under the program. Charges against all but two were
dropped when the women entered treatment. Some of the women were
taken from their hospital rooms in handcuffs or leg shackles. The
plaintiffs are seeking damages and an injunction against future
drug testing.
</P>
<P>
   Analytically, the case is quite similar to another Fourth
Amendment case the Supreme Court accepted for review last week, on
whether police checkpoints that subject motorists to drug-detecting
dogs are constitutional. The lower court in that case, Indianapolis
vs. Edmond, rejected the government's argument that the need to
detect and deter drug trafficking was a ``special need'' that
justified the warrantless searches.
</P>
<P>
   In the new case, Ferguson v. City of Charleston, No. 99-936, the
city asserts that the hospital adopted its policy, in cooperation
with the police and local prosecutor's office, in 1989 in the face
of ``an epidemic of cocaine use'' among its maternity patients.
</P>
<P>
   ``The clinical necessity for the drug screens, the health
problems associated with maternal cocaine use, and the astronomical
economic costs of caring for infants suffering from the effects of
cocaine use by their mothers all created special needs beyond
normal law enforcement goals,'' the city maintains. That was the
analysis endorsed in a 2-1 decision by the 4th U.S. Circuit Court
of Appeals, in Richmond, Va., which affirmed a jury's verdict in
favor of the hospital.
</P>
<P>
   The hospital did not test all its patients, instead singling out
those it regarded as most likely to be using drugs. The criteria
included having received no prenatal care or care that was late or
incomplete; displaying certain physical symptoms; unexplained
preterm labor; and known drug or alcohol abuse in the past. Many of
the public hospital's patients are poor and black; of the 10
plaintiffs, nine are black and one is white.
</P>
<P>
   As the crack epidemic hit its peak, states adopted varying
approaches to the issue of drug use by pregnant women. Because a
number of state courts ruled, unlike the South Carolina Supreme
Court, that a fetus could not be considered a child for purposes of
prosecuting pregnant women under child abuse laws, some prosecutors
argued that mothers delivered illegal drugs to their newborn babies
through the umbilical cord during the brief moments between birth
and the cutting of the cord.
</P>
<P>
   A woman was convicted in Florida under this theory in 1989, but
the Florida Supreme Court overturned the conviction three years
later, ruling unanimously that when the state Legislature made
``delivery'' of illegal drugs a crime, it did not contemplate a
prosecution of this sort.

 &HT;    Bush campaign visits Ohio today
 &HT;    By William Hershey
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Today it's Texas Gov. George W. Bush's turn to
bring presidential politics to Ohio, with campaign stops in
Cleveland, suburban Columbus and Cincinnati.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gov. Bush is excited to come to Ohio,'' said Orest Holubec,
spokesman for the Bush campaign in Ohio. ``He knows that there is a
huge grassroots effort in place here. He understands that the base
is energized.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush is scheduled to begin the day at 9 a.m. at the Fatima
Family Center on Cleveland's east side, a Catholic church-sponsored
agency that serves everyone from infants to senior citizens.
</P>
<P>
   Next, Bush is to be at Westerville High School, just outside
Columbus, for a 12:50 p.m. town meeting, said Holubec.
</P>
<P>
   Bush will wrap up the day with an open-to-the-public rally at
Memorial Hall, 1225 Elm St., in Cincinnati at 7:20 p.m. Arizona
Sen. John McCain, Bush's opponent in next Tuesday'sRepublican
primary, spent Saturday in Ohio, a day after Vice President Al Gore
was in Cleveland. Gore opposes former New Jersey Sen. Bill Bradley
in the Democratic primary.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's visit to the Fatima Center comes in the wake of a letter
he sent to Roman Catholic Cardinal John O'Connor of New York
expressing regret for not distancing himself from the religious and
racial intolerance at ultra-conservative Bob Jones University in
South Carolina, where he spoke before the South Carolina primary
this month.
</P>
<P>
   Holubec, however, said the stop at the Fatima Center is ``in
line'' with other events Bush has held at church-sponsored agencies
and in keeping with the Texas governor's ``compassionate
conservative'' philosophy.
</P>
<P>
   The McCain campaign has been exploiting Bush's visit to Bob
Jones. Before last week's Republican vote in Michigan, McCain
supporters called voters reminding them of Bush's bob Jones
appearance.
</P>
<P>
   In Columbus on Monday, Sen. Mike DeWine, R-Ohio, a national
co-chairman of McCain's campaign, said he does not believe the
national McCain campaign will make similar phone calls to Catholic
voters in Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   Also, Curt Steiner, a Columbus-based consultant who is advising
the McCain campaign, said that in Ohio the campaign will not send
post cards to Democrats, urging them to vote for McCain in the
Republican primary. Such cards were sent in Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   Their comments came as the McCain campaign opened an office in
downtown Columbus.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we see in Ohio is a very fluid situation,'' DeWine said.
``We think we have a genuine chance of winning in Ohio.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Dayton area, some Montgomery County Republicans also met
Monday morning to rally support for McCain.
</P>
<P>
   State Sen. Chuck Horn, R-Centerville, a former backer of U.S.
Rep John Kasich, switched to McCain because he believes McCain has
a better chance of winning in November.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am afraid the Republicans are about to make a big mistake
(nominating Bush),'' Horn said.
</P>
<P>
   Horn pulled together about 20 people to talk about generating
more support from McCain in the coming week. A handful of were from
the University of Dayton College Republicans. Some supported McCain
but Matt LaFontaine, 20, from Chicago, a sophomore studying public
relations, remained in Bush's camp despite the pleadings.
</P>
<P>
   ``The McCain camp is doing a good job running on his image but
when push comes to shove policy-wise, I think the man who can get
it done is George Bush,'' LaFontaine said.

 &HT;    Independents loom large in Ohio
 &HT;    By William Hershey
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLUMBUS _ Ohio may have a ``closed'' system for voting in
primary elections, but 5.5 million voters _ or about three-quarters
of those registered _ are considered independent and free to vote
in the primary of their choice without challenge.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona Sen. John McCain is banking on strong support from these
independents _ Ohio law calls them non-partisans _ in his race
against Texas Gov. George W. Bush in the Republican primary, Sen.
Mike DeWine, a McCain campaign national co-chairman, said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Independents _ and Democrats _ helped McCain to victory in
Michigan, where Bush did well among registered Republicans but
still lost by 6 percentage points. But unlike Michigan, Ohio has
both a Democratic and Republican primary on March 7, making it less
likely that Democrats will cross over to vote for McCain.
</P>
<P>
   Dayton-based political consultant James Nathanson, a Bush
supporter, said, many of the 5.5 million voters classified as
non-partisan on voter rolls consider themselves Republicans or
Democrats. Bush will do well with the Republicans and defeat
McCain, predicted Nathanson, former political director for the
Republican National Committee.
</P>
<P>
   There is such a large number of independents because of how Ohio
defines Republicans and Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Under Ohio law, a voter is defined as a Democrat or Republican
if he or she voted in a primary for that party during the past two
years, said Carlo LoParo, spokesman for Ohio Secretary of State J.
Kenneth Blackwell. Otherwise, the voter is classified as
``non-partisan'' or independent he said.
</P>
<P>
   During 1998-1999, 946,958 Ohioans voted in Democratic primaries
and 844,906 voted in Republican primaries. A total of 5,401,546
were registered to vote but did not vote in a primary during the
past two years, LoParo said.
</P>
<P>
   Those figures were as of last September, said LoParo. The number
of independents has grown since then because new voters have been
registered and none have voted in primaries. New figures will be
announced this week, LoParo said.
</P>
<P>
   In Ohio, voters who participated in a Republican or Democratic
primary during the past two years may be challenged if they ask for
the other party's primary ballot. The challenges are carried out
automatically in about half of Ohio's 88 counties, said LoParo.
</P>
<P>
   Because relatively few Ohio voters legally qualify as Democrats
or Republicans, such crossovers are not expected to be as big a
factor here as the ability of the candidates to draw support from
the nearly 5.5 million independents.
</P>
<P>
   Nathanson said that some of these voters were stripped of their
party labels simply because they missed voting in one primary. They
might have voted in the 1996 presidential primary, for example, but
not in a primary during 1998 or 1999, said Nathanson. Turnout
usually is larger during presidential primaries than during other
primaries, he said.
</P>
<P>
   He predicted increased participation in the Republican primary
by Republican-inclined voters who usually only cast ballots in
general elections. The advantage among these voters will go to
Bush, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Political scientist Robert Adams of Wright State University said
that the large number of nonpartisan voters gives McCain an
opportunity in Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   ``He needs to turn out that independent group and get them to
vote for him,'' said Adams. ``I think he's riding a tiger but so
far he has been able to stay on the back.''

 &HT;    Youth vote in America may play a greater role
 &HT;    By Scott Montgomery
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON _ In the closing weeks of the hot New Hampshire
presidential primary, the one that vaulted Arizona Sen. John McCain
from intriguing bit player to serious contender for the Republican
nomination, the University of Dayton campus was the site of a
battle all its own.
</P>
<P>
   Through a coordinated effort with campus political groups and
other organizations, the office of UD President Bro. Raymond Fitz
led a drive to register students to vote. They had resident
assistants hand out forms in dorm halls, they staffed a table every
day in the cafeteria, they flooded the neighborhood of student
houses near campus with volunteers to knock on every door.
</P>
<P>
   The effort ran from Jan. 18 to Feb. 4 and was punctuated with
McCain's stunning, widely covered, New Hampshire win on Feb. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Organizers at UD handed out 9,000 voter registration forms.
</P>
<P>
   They got back about 150.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not a great turn-in,'' deadpanned Chris Woodard, a graduate
assistant in the Fitz' office. ``I think there is the underlying
sense that, as a college student, your vote doesn't count.''
</P>
<P>
   But seldom has there been a time when the youth vote in America
could count so much.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time, the entire cohort known as Generation X _
whose members range in age from 18 to about 35 _ is eligible to
vote. In November they will represent about 40 percent of all
eligible voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very exciting,'' said Nannette Whaley, 24, president of
the Montgomery County Young Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   The question is whether the races will be exciting enough to
lure young voters to the polls. As evidenced by the scene at UD,
which is not atypical, polls show young Americans to be notoriously
disinterested in voting. Although presidential elections tend to
bring higher turn-outs among voters of all age groups, the trend
among young voters is unmistakably down both locally and
nationally.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Third Millennium, an advocacy group for young
voters based in New York, only 34 percent of voters between the
ages of 18 and 34 voted in the 1996 election, when the rate for all
ages was 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Two years later in Montgomery County, only 22 percent of
registered 18- to 32 year-olds voted in the November 1998
elections, a Dayton Daily News analysis found. It was the lowest
percentage of any age group, although it comprised the largest
group in terms of sheer numbers. In the age group 57 and older, 65
percent voted.
</P>
<P>
   And the National Association of Secretaries of State, the public
office that manages elections in each state, reported last year
that participation by 18- to 24-year-olds has dropped dramatically
in recent decades. In 1972, half of that age group voted in the
presidential election. In 1996, only 32 percent did.
</P>
<P>
   The reasons for this seem not to be a mystery. In 1972, for
instance, 18- to 24-year-olds were still confronted with the
Vietnam War. But the issues at work in succeeding years are more
complicated and nuanced than simple self-preservation, according to
experts who follow the trends.
</P>
<P>
   The lack of life-or-death issues is one factor, they say. But
the presence in recent decades of high profile political scandal is
another. So is the decline in the quality of public education,
particularly in cities, and in civic lessons.
</P>
<P>
   ``And there's been a constant drumbeat of demagoguery against
government,'' said Curtis Gans, who heads the nonpartisan Committee
for the Study of the American Electorate, ``which is not likely to
encourage people to vote.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You put all of that together and there are powerful forces for
why young people aren't participating.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, there are exceptions.
</P>
<P>
   Ali Adinaro, a 21-year-old junior at UD, is a past president of
the school's Young Republicans organization. She grew up in a
conservative household in Cleveland and is fully wired for politics
already.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've literally been passing out literature since I was 10,''
said the marketing major, ``for school levies and stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   But the apathy of her contemporaries is no secret to her. She
has been in the trenches trying to recruit fellow activists. She
has seen the eyes roll at talk of privatizing Social Security
accounts or rolling back welfare.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of my friends don't care,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   About a month ago, 18-year-old Brett McDaniel, 18, walked in
unannounced to the headquarters of the Montgomery County Democratic
Party. The senior at Chaminade-Julienne High School is energized
just by the prospect of casting his first vote this year. He has
attended meetings and already is volunteering on the U.S. Senate
campaign of the Rev. Marvin McMickle of Cleveland, one of four
people seeking the Democratic nomination in next Tuesday's primary.
</P>
<P>
   But last week he was reminded that many of his peers don't share
his enthusiasm. In a hallway at school, McDaniel approached a
fellow senior to talk about presidential candidates but he was
interrupted by someone who overheard.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some girl said I bring that stuff up too much,'' McDaniel
said. ``She said I need to stop worrying about that and let my
parents worry about it.''
</P>
<P>
   But there have been cases when young voters haven't left it to
their parents, and they have directed the outcome of elections.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Rep. Ted Strickland, D-Portsmouth, is widely understood to
have retaken in 1996 the seat he'd lost in 1994 by mobilizing
thousands of students at Ohio University.
</P>
<P>
   ``That group of students elected a congressman,'' said Whaley of
the Young Democrats. ``How exciting is that?''
</P>
<P>
   And in a shot heard `round the world, young voters flooded the
polls on Election Day in Minnesota in 1998 to make the mouthy
professional wrestler Jesse Ventura governor. His third-party
assault on the status quo overwhelmed respected candidates from the
Republican and Democratic parties.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was big on FM rock radio stations,'' said Steve Shier,
political science chairman at Carleton College in Minnesota. ``I
would not call any of his ads conventional, which made them much
more likely to appeal to younger voters.''
</P>
<P>
   Statistics from the Minnesota Secretary of State showed an
unusual spike in Election Day registration for a non-presidential
year, and turnout among young voters was remarkably high. Although
the percentages were skewed because of same-day registrants, nearly
80 percent of the 18 year-olds who registered to vote actually
voted.
</P>
<P>
   The Ventura phenomenon was scant on issues. He ran a short
campaign that emphasized his reputation for bluntness and
fearlessness.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just him,'' said Adinaro. ``I'm sure he's very
intelligent, I just can't believe the kids were really listening.
It was all image.''
</P>
<P>
   Whaley, the Democrat, agreed. She said Minnesota's young voters
were seduced only by the persona because Ventura's views on things,
such federal student loans, don't match what most young people say
they support.
</P>
<P>
   ``It does happen that way,'' she acknowledged. ``I think Bill
Clinton won the youth vote in `92 by putting on sunglasses on
Arsenio Hall. It was cool.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite this, Whaley argues that young voters do have issues
that matter to them, including student loans and universal health
care. She said in many ways young voters are no different from
other voters in that they respond best to issues that hit them
directly, and hit them now.
</P>
<P>
   ``People in Washington like to say Social Security is an issue
that bridges the gap for all voters, but it doesn't,'' she said.
``That's 40 years away for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Which raises the bottom line issue campaigns face on the issue
of young voters: to target or not to target?
</P>
<P>
   Third Millennium, the advocacy group, has begun a program called
Neglection 2000 that will study whether presidential candidates are
running campaign ads in places where young voters are likely to see
them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are they running them during reruns of the Golden Girls or
during Friends?'' said Richard Thau, 35, president of the group.
``The candidates include their children and grandchildren in
speeches, but they don't speak to them.''
</P>
<P>
   Thau says campaigns have a civic obligation to seek out new,
young voters rather than focus on reliable, older voters simply
because it's cheaper for them.
</P>
<P>
   Others dispute this, including Whaley, who said she thinks both
parties may be reluctant to agitate the youth vote unless they can
be sure their candidate is positioned well to capture that vote.
</P>
<P>
   A case in point may be the case of McCain, who is seen by the
experts as having tried the hardest to attract young voters. His
New Hampshire campaign included many visits to college campuses,
and even fraternity houses.
</P>
<P>
   But a recent study by Pew Research Center for the People and the
Press shows that Texas Gov. George W. Bush and Vice President Al
Gore both drew a higher percentage of the under-30 crowd in
head-to-head match ups.
</P>
<P>
   Schier, the Minnesota professor, said he sees in McCain a
persona-driven cam similar to the one Ventura ran. Heavy on
personality, though not as light on issues, Schier said McCain
could yet spark a youth movement like the one Ventura had.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are the wild card, when they move they can move in a big
direction,'' he said. ``But if there is going to be a youth push,
we may not know it until the very end.''

`FOR DUMMIES' PUBLISHER PLEDGES $350 MILLION TO MIT FOR BRAIN
RESEARCH 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By CAREY GOLDBERG    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAMBRIDGE, Mass. _ A computer publishing billionaire and his
wife pledged Monday to give the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology the largest single donation yet to a university _ $350
million over the next 20 years _ to finance research on the brain.
</P>
<P>
   The money, from Patrick J. and Lore Harp McGovern, will create
the McGovern Institute for Brain Research, a center with a staff of
300, including computer scientists, psychologists and molecular
biologists. The donation comes at a moment when neuroscience is
making great advances, powered by recent progress in imaging
technology, cell biology and genomics.
</P>
<P>
   ``We both have a great interest and fascination with this last
frontier of discovery,'' McGovern said Monday at the signing an
initial agreement on the institute.
</P>
<P>
   McGovern, 62, is founder and chairman of International Data
Group, a company known for publishing Computerworld, putting out
the ``For Dummies'' book series and organizing huge computer
industry conferences.
</P>
<P>
   Back in the 1950s, when he was a mere MIT undergraduate,
McGovern majored in life sciences and studied the human nervous
system. And even before that, he said, when he was a teen-ager
visiting the public library in Philadelphia, he came upon a book
called ``Giant Minds, or Machines that Think'' that changed his
life, infecting him with ideas about how computers could enhance
human reasoning.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. McGovern, a 55-year-old high-tech entrepreneur, said that
she also traced her interest in the brain back some 50 years, to a
visit to a science museum when she was 5 years old. Her parents
showed her a brain in formaldehyde at a science museum and she
asked, ``Can you touch thought? Does it have physical presence?''
</P>
<P>
   ``And so maybe now we can figure that out,'' she said. ``So let
the journey begin.''
</P>
<P>
   The first thing the McGoverns had to figure out, they said, was
where to put the institute they had decided to create about three
years ago. They put together an advisory committee and considered
seven universities: Columbia; University of California campuses in
San Francisco, Berkeley and San Diego; the California Institute of
Technology; Stanford and MIT. McGovern acknowledged that his
emotional ties to MIT had played a role in the decision, but said
more objective factors also came into play, including its
neuroscience programs and its ``willingness to be very
collaborative.''
</P>
<P>
   In the style of many Internet-age benefactors, the McGoverns
plan to keep a close eye on the institute and will sit on its
board, along with directors from MIT and outside neuroscientists.
</P>
<P>
   The money will begin to flow as yearly gifts of about $5
million, McGovern said. The amounts will slowly scale up until, at
the end of 20 years, the McGoverns donate the rest of the $350
million to endow the institute in perpetuity.
</P>
<P>
   The gift beats by $50 million the record for a single donation
to a university, according to a list published by the Chronicle of
Higher Education. The former record-setting donation was $300
million in stock from the Ingram Charitable Fund to Vanderbilt
University, announced in 1998. Last year, the Bill and Melinda
Gates Foundation gave $1 billion to create the Gates Millennium
Scholars program, but the money, intended to encourage minority
students in science and technology, is to be spread among many
institutions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gifts of $100 million are becoming commonplace at certain
institutions,'' said Stacy Palmer, editor of The Chronicle of
Philanthropy. ``But $350 million is still an awful lot of money for
one couple to give.''
</P>
<P>
   The money comes at an opportune time, said Phillip A. Sharp, a
Nobel-laureate molecular biologist who will serve as the
institute's founding director. Among other factors, scientists
seeking to unravel the workings of the brain now have at their
disposal new knowledge about how nerve cells work, he said, and the
soon-to-be-completed mapping of the human genome is expected to
contribute insights as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of this is a basis upon which, not in the next year, not
even in 10 years, but perhaps in 20 years, we'll be able to draw
out the general and specific functions of the brain in complex
phenomena, like learning behavior, those sorts of processes,'' he
said. ``And it's terribly exciting.''
</P>
<P>
   McGovern, asked if he had one pet neuroscience problem he would
like to see solved, said it would probably be the causes of
misperception: why the brain takes in or remembers things
incorrectly.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. McGovern said she was most interested in attacking learning
disabilities.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we can tap into the intellectual potential and bring
everyone up to par,'' she said, ``we can create a so much better
society.''

 &HT;    New magazines vie for young crowd
 &HT;    By Don O'Briant
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The newsstands get a little more crowded this week with the
launching of three new magazines. The bimonthly teenStyle ($4.95),
which proclaims itself ``the biggest hair and beauty magazine for
teens,'' offers a ``flip'' format for the premiere issue. In other
words, half the magazine is upside down until you flip it over and
start from the back. Both halves deal with such weighty topics as
hairstyles, prom preparation, Gwyneth Paltrow's favorite scent and
how Jennifer Lopez maintains her glowing complexion.
</P>
<P>
   Tennis pro Anna Kournikova and other female athletes offer
training tips in the first issue of Sports Illustrated for Women
($3.50). Debuting as a bimonthly publication, the magazine is aimed
at women ages 18-34 who have a passion for sports. In addition to
standard articles on fitness, food and athletic gear, the magazine
talks with Olympic gold medalist skater Tara Lipinski about her new
movie career.
</P>
<P>
   The glossy, ad-packed premiere issue of FHM ($2.99) is aimed at
the same young males who read Maxim, Details and GQ. Along with a
special pullout section on ``The Girls of FHM,'' a collection of
scantily clad models and celebrities such as the above-mentioned
Lopez and Britney Spears, FHM offers a wide selection of service
articles on fashion, grooming and sex, and features on film
director Wes Craven and boxing promoter Don King.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most interesting piece is the graphic account of a
Hawaiian vacation gone terribly wrong in ``Sharks Ate My Wife!''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Law and disorder: As expected, Time ($3.50) and Newsweek
($3.50) devote a substantial portion of their issues to the not
guilty verdict in the Amadou Diallo case and the continuing
controversy surrounding the police departments in New York and Los
Angeles. Bronx district attorney Robert Johnson is blamed for
losing the trial, Time says, because race was never brought up as
an issue.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The truth is out there: Yes, it sounds like something from
``The X-Files,'' but Life ($3.99) reports that a new poll shows
that 49 percent of Americans believe the government is withholding
information about the existence of UFOs. More than 2 million insist
they have had an encounter with beings from another planet.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Tipper's turn: If Tipper Gore hates Washington as much as she
says she does, why is she campaigning so hard for her husband? New
Yorker ($3) writer Elsa Walsh reports that the reluctant political
wife sees the campaign as a necessary sacrifice. Walsh also reports
that relations with the Clintons are strained, not only because of
the Lewinsky scandal, but because Hillary Rodham Clinton kept Mrs.
Gore waiting for an hour and a half at a Gore fund-raiser last
year.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Who's who: Society isn't dead; just the names and faces have
changed. The Astors and Rothschilds are still in demand at glitzy
parties, but nowadays they're likely to find themselves rubbing
elbows with Madonna and Puff Daddy. In the March issue of W
($4.50), the editors put their heads together to come up with a new
A-list. Along with the usual suspects are Melinda and Bill Gates,
Brad Pitt, David E. Kelley and Michelle Pfeiffer, Prince William of
Wales and Camilla Parker Bowles. And, by the way, even if you're
not interested in fashion, the fabulous 30-page spread that was
shot in Havana is worth a look.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Quick reads: U.S. News &AMP; World Report ($3.50) questions the
increasing use of psychiatric drugs to control children's behavior.
Such drugs should be a last resort after therapy, some experts say,
not the first step. ... Are Bruce Willis and Julia Roberts really
worth $20 million per film? Apparently so, says Entertainment
Weekly ($2.99), because they are big box-office draws. Not so for
Jodie Foster, who, at $15 million, is not as bankable as Roberts.

TIJUANA OFFICIAL SAYS SLAYING SHOWS TRAFFICKERS' POWER 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By SAM DILLON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ One day after gunmen killed the chief of police in
Tijuana, the sprawling city that borders California, the state
governor said that drug traffickers were out of control there
partly because many federal authorities were in their pay.
</P>
<P>
   ``The drugs are coming in by land, sea and air,'' Gov. Alejandro
Gonzalez Alcocer of Baja California said in a telephone interview.
``The federal authorities have jurisdiction, but frankly, we don't
have much confidence in them. We worry that if we try to coordinate
operations with them, our plans will be communicated to the
traffickers.''
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, during a visit to Baja California by President
Ernesto Zedillo, Gonzalez urged the president to speak out against
the drug traffickers, who have been blamed for the killings of some
60 people in Tijuana in eight weeks. In a speech later, the
president promised a crackdown, saying, ``We have to make these
criminals understand that they're not welcome in Baja California,
that the only home they deserve are the prisons.''
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, gunmen in cars ambushed and killed the Tijuana police
chief, Alfredo de la Torre Marquez, as he drove along a freeway. He
was hit by dozens of bullets, the police said.
</P>
<P>
   One reasonable hypothesis, Gonzalez said, was that the
traffickers ordered the police chief's assassination as a dramatic
response to the president.
</P>
<P>
   Zedillo, a Yale-trained economist who has rarely displayed
personal interest in the narcotics problems, made no reference
Monday to De la Torre's murder in a speech delivered to a
government audience. A spokesman said the president would have no
comment on the situation in Tijuana.
</P>
<P>
   ``Its just a police matter,'' a presidential aide said.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez, who belongs to the center-right National Action Party,
said that during Zedillo's visit to Baja California last week, he
realized that the president had no plans to mention the rising
narcotics violence in Baja California. As the two drove together to
a joint public appearance in Mexicali, on the border east of
Tijuana, the governor asked the president to address the drug
problem, Gonzalez said.
</P>
<P>
   Minutes later, in his speech, Zedillo promised to send his
interior minister and attorney general to Tijuana to review federal
crime efforts in Baja California. Spokesmen for those officials
said Monday that they would travel to Tijuana on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   While Zedillo was touring Tijuana on Friday, his Foreign
Ministry was lodging a formal protest against Ambassador Jeffrey
Davidow of the United States, who said last week that Mexico had
assumed a leading role in international drug trafficking. Davidow's
statements provoked an outpouring of recriminations from Mexican
politicians, many from Zedillo's governing party, who view any
commentary about organized crime in Mexico by foreigners as an
attack on national pride.

 &HT;    Bush's attempt to make amends with Catholic voters may be too
late
 &HT;    By Jena Heath
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Texas Gov. George W. Bush hoped for redemption with
his mea culpa to Catholics, but the gesture may be too late to save
him in New York's important March 7 Republican primary.
</P>
<P>
   Bush was treading water in New York before he sent a letter
Monday to Cardinal John O'Connor that also went to Catholic leaders
in other states. The letter expressed regret for Bush's Feb. 2
appearance at Bob Jones University, an evangelical South Carolina
school that bans interracial dating and has an anti-Catholic
philosophy.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the flap over the speech will cost Bush votes in New
York _ a Super Tuesday prize with 101 delegates _ isn't known yet.
But some New Yorkers are asking how Bush strategists could have
failed to foresee the potential cost.
</P>
<P>
   ``Usually, you don't pick your own Willie Horton,'' Lee
Miringoff, head of the New York-based Marist Poll, said of the
tactical move that could hurt Bush as much as the prison furlough
issue helped his father against Democrat Michael Dukakis in 1988.
``Usually, that's something cast upon you. You don't volunteer.''
</P>
<P>
   A Marist College poll taken after the South Carolina primary had
Bush and Arizona Sen. John McCain in a statistical dead heat. A
Zogby International poll released Monday _ too soon to gauge the
effect of the controversy _ found McCain leading Bush 45 percent to
39.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this point, if McCain has a good week, he could impact New
York in a way that no one ever foresaw awhile ago ...'' Miringoff
said. ``Why talk at Bob Jones University? Catholics are the largest
single voting group in New York for Republicans ... The dug-out
chatter is Bob Jones University, so this has gotten very
interesting, very competitive. All bets are off in New York.''
</P>
<P>
   New York has 2.4 million Catholics and they make up an estimated
54 percent of Republican voters. Losing the state would be
especially bruising for Bush because only Republicans can
participate, not the independents and Democrats who thwarted him in
heavily Catholic Michigan last week.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has been fighting the anti-Catholic label since the McCain
campaign paid for calls to Catholic voters in Michigan telling them
that Bush spoke at Bob Jones and emphasizing the school's
anti-Catholic philosophy. McCain initially said that he did not
know about the calls. Later, he said he signed off on the script.
</P>
<P>
   As part of its defense, the Bush campaign sent an opinion piece
to newspapers in Super Tuesday states and Catholic publications
across the country Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is important to set the record straight about the
governor's record of inclusiveness and his record of welcoming
people of all faiths into politics,'' campaign spokesman Scott
McClellan said of the pieces. ``Despite, promising not to engage in
negative tactics, Sen. McCain is playing upon people's religious
fears in pitting people against one another.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Bush backers such as New York Gov. George Pataki
took to the airwaves and talked with reporters to defend their
candidate.
</P>
<P>
   ``To suggest that there's either insensitivity or bigotry
anywhere in here is really a gross injustice ...'' said Rep. John
Sweeney (R-N.Y.), who is Catholic. ``It's the kind of divisive
politics that I think, in the end, leads only to bad things and
negativism. Enough of this. Somebody's got to be the adult here and
I think George Bush is doing that.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Peter King (R-N.Y.) said he believes the issue could cost
Bush New York. King, who is Catholic, switched his allegiance to
McCain to protest Bush's decision to speak at Bob Jones.
</P>
<P>
   ``The letter is a partial step but I think the way it's being
perceived here in New York ... was that he got the benefit out of
Bob Jones in South Carolina and he waited three or four weeks to
express his regret on the eve of the New York primary,'' King said.
``So, I think it's being looked upon pretty much as a political
move.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Connor, who is ill, has seen Bush's letter, but will have no
comment, said Joseph Zwilling, Archdiocese spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Patrick Scully, spokesman for the Catholic League for Religious
&AMP; Civil Rights, said that as far as his group is concerned, Bush is
forgiven.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been hammering the governor for not coming out and
disavowing and disassociating himself'' from the university's
anti-Catholic bias, Scully said. ``The best he could do was, 'My
brother's a Catholic, my sister-in-law's Catholic. What we were
looking for was him denouncing the anti-Catholic policies of Bob
Jones University, which he has done. The Catholic League accepts
that and we feel that should settle the issue.''

WIRELESS INTERNET NEXT TECHNO BONANZA, GATES SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER J. HOWE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW ORLEANS _ Microsoft founder Bill Gates, whose acumen at
developing and marketing software has made him the world's
wealthiest man, Monday declared wireless Internet access will be
the next big technology revolution.
</P>
<P>
   ``Microsoft wants to be there and provide the software that
makes it happen,'' Gates told 25,000 attendees here at the Cellular
Telecommunications Industry Association's annual convention.
</P>
<P>
   In his first appearance at the annual convention, Gates
announced a new pact with wireless carrier Nextel Communications
that by next month will bring access to Microsoft MSN Web content _
including its popular Hotmail electronic mail service _ to Nextel
subscribers, among them tens of thousands of Greater Boston users.
</P>
<P>
   And without divulging exact figures, Gates, who recently moved
from chief executive to chief software architect, said the company
has decided that of the billions of dollars it invests annually in
product development, ``the wireless area would receive the greatest
increase of all the things we are doing.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no doubt that this is an industry sitting on the verge
of unbelievable opportunity,'' he said in an opening keynote
address of Wireless 2000. ``Wireless is really the key component
that's going to take these kinds of (Internet) empowerment that
we've always believed in and make them a reality.''
</P>
<P>
   Through Microsoft's alliance with Nextel, people who have Nextel
phones _ which feature a two-way radio capability that makes them
popular with businesses _ will be able to use the phone to read
their Hotmail messages and get access to other services at the MSN
Web portal such as news, weather, and stock quotes. Pricing for the
service has not yet been determined.
</P>
<P>
   Hotmail, a free e-mail service, has more than 56 million active
accounts, Gates said. By setting up filters at the Hotmail portal,
subscribers could choose to have alerts sent to their phones when
they get messages from certain recipients, then click a button on
the phone to read the messages if they want. Users could respond to
messages by forming short text responses with the telephone keypad,
pressing numbers 1 to 4 times to make letters.
</P>
<P>
   Deanna Sanford, a senior Microsoft executive, said the Nextel
pact ``is just kind of the start for us'' and the company is eager
to extend the new MSN Mobile 2.0 service to all carriers serving
each US market. Microsoft announced a similar pact with Vodafone
AirTouch, which chiefly serves Western US markets but is combining
its US operations with Bell Atlantic mobile.
</P>
<P>
   People with digital cell phones that can send and receive e-mail
already can gain access to Hotmail through the www.mobile.msn.com
site, but Sanford acknowledged the company has not aggressively
promoted it. One advantage to linking Hotmail with Nextel and
AirTouch service is that many wireless carriers, including Bell
Atlantic Mobile and Sprint PCS in Boston, require people to have
separate e-mail accounts for their phones.
</P>
<P>
   Also addressing the convention was William E. Kennard, chairman
of the Federal Communications Commission, who said wireless is
emerging as ``the premier network for the 21st century. . . . I
believe we will look back and remember this as the time when the
Internet migrated out of clunky, cumbersome machines called PCs and
into a wide array of handheld wireless devices.''
</P>
<P>
   But Kennard said growth is running up against limits caused by a
shortage of radio-wave spectrum. While the FCC plans this year to
sell space now used by television channels 60 to 69 and ``C-block''
spectrum owned by bankrupt carriers for new wireless uses, Kennard
said problems of ``spectrum drought'' loom.
</P>
<P>
   Kennard said he has directed FCC staffers to develop efforts to
create a secondary market for reselling and buying allocated but
unused spectrum, including a Web site listing all available
frequencies by licensee. The FCC also will promote
``software-defined radios'' to make better use of existing
frequencies, Kennard said.
</P>
<P>
   John D. Zeglis, chief executive of AT&AMP;T Wireless, for which AT&AMP;T
is expected to offer a tracking stock in what could be a $10
billion-plus offering, told convention attendees that the wireless
industry now ``is about where black-and-white televisions were in
the 1950s.''
</P>
<P>
   Thirty-two percent of Americans now use wireless communications
devices, a ratio that could double if US usage reaches the usage
levels in parts of Scandinavia, and Zeglis noted that growth is
almost entirely due to ``the first application. This is only on
voice.'' As wireless data applications grow, Zeglis predicted
another huge wave of growth.

ALUMNUS TO GIVE MIT $350M FOR BRAIN STUDY INSTITUTE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHRIS REIDY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   An alumnus who made his fortune publishing such books as
``Internet for Dummies'' said Monday that he and his wife will give
the Massachusetts Institute of Technology $350 million to establish
an institute for the study of the human brain.
</P>
<P>
   The gift from International Data Group founder Patrick J.
McGovern Jr. and his wife, entrepreneur Lore Harp McGovern, is
believed to be the largest ever pledged to a US university.
</P>
<P>
   The McGoverns considered six other schools before selecting MIT.
The director for the McGovern Institute for Brain Research will be
Phillip A. Sharp, who won a Nobel Prize in medicine in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   The previous record for a donation to a US university appears to
have been 1998's gift of stock from the Ingram Charitable
Foundation to Vanderbilt University that the Chronicle of Higher
Education estimated to be worth about $300 million.
</P>
<P>
   Gifts can be tricky to measure, said Chronicle managing editor
Douglas Lederman. They can be doled out over time, and assets such
as stock shares can appreciate or fall in value.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, the late Sir Harold Acton donated a large Italian
estate and a Renaissance art collection to New York University.
Estimates of the gift's value have varied widely, ranging from $250
million to $500 million.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, Emory University received a gift valued at $295
million.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of MIT, the McGoverns have agreed to donate $5
million annually over 20 years, along with an adjustment for
inflation. The bulk of the gift, or an estimated $250 million, will
be donated in the final year of the agreement.
</P>
<P>
   The McGoverns said they only learned last week that their gift
could be the largest ever to a university. The gift's size was
based solely on their estimates of what it would cost to establish
a 300-person research center, they said.
</P>
<P>
   This was not the typical case of a rich alumnus giving to his
alma mater. In looking to establish the McGovern Institute for
Brain Research, the couple evaluated seven universities as they
searched for the ideal environment and academic culture where their
institute could flourish.
</P>
<P>
   Among other schools considered were the California Institute of
Technology, Columbia University, and Stanford University _ but not
Harvard University.
</P>
<P>
   A three-year evaluation process led to the selection of MIT,
which has made advances in neurosciences a strategic priority.
</P>
<P>
   While Patrick McGovern acknowledged an emotional bias toward his
alma mater, he said, ``MIT won on the merits.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, MIT was selected because of its expertise in such
disciplines as neuroscience, molecular neurobiology,
bioengineering, cognitive sciences, computation, and genetics.
</P>
<P>
   The McGoverns declined to detail how also-rans were winnowed
out. When asked which school was runner-up, they had no comment.
</P>
<P>
   The McGoverns said they hoped the selection process would focus
more attention on neurosciences on other campuses and inspire other
philanthropists to follow their example.
</P>
<P>
   As for the institute itself, the McGoverns said they hope it
will yield findings about human behavior that someday will reduce
misunderstanding, distrust, and conflict among individuals,
societies, and nations.
</P>
<P>
   ``As we move into the knowledge economy, we hope that the
interdiscipliniary research at the McGovern Institute will lead to
improvements in receiving, analyzing, associating, storing,
retrieving, and communicating information,'' said Patrick McGovern,
62, who graduated from MIT in 1959.
</P>
<P>
   MIT president Charles M. Vest said the McGoverns' gift will have
major significance for the university.
</P>
<P>
   The brain institute, he said, ``will launch one of the most
profound and important scientific ventures of the next century and
what will surely be a cornerstone of MIT's scientific contributions
in the decades ahead.''
</P>
<P>
   Both McGoverns said they have been fascinated by the workings of
the human brain since childhood. As a teenager in Philadelphia,
Patrick McGovern said one of his favorite books described the brain
as a ``machine that thinks.''
</P>
<P>
   Growing up in Germany, Lore McGovern recalled a visit to a
museum where a human brain was preserved in formaldehyde.
</P>
<P>
   ``I asked my parents, `Can I touch thought?''' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The idea of establishing an institute for brain research is one
they've thought about for nearly a decade.
</P>
<P>
   Both McGoverns have connections to the Whitehead Institute, an
MIT research center for biomedical study. Their experience at
Whitehead convinced them that a center of similar size and scope
could make big strides in neurosciences.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have seen how much scientific progress can be achieved in an
institute dedicated to a specific mission,'' Lore Harp McGovern
said. ``It is my hope that in our lifetime, we will be able to
point proudly to the McGovern Institute for Brain Research and its
important contributions to enhancing human learning,
communications, and quality of life.''
</P>
<P>
   Plans call for director Sharp to assemble a team of 16
investigators to study the brain, including 10 new faculty members.
In all, the institute would employ about 300 people and have an
annual budget of around $20 million, with much of the financing
coming from research grants. At some point, a building will be
constructed for the institute.
</P>
<P>
   Coincidentally, Monday was the 36th anniversary of the
incorporation of Patrick McGovern's company, IDG. Boston-based IDG
operates about 250 Web sites and publishes about 300 magazines,
including Macworld and PC World. IDG had 1999 revenues of about
$2.56 billion. In October, Forbes magazine estimated McGovern's
worth at $1.8 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Lore Harp McGovern, meanwhile, has headed companies that have
produced educational materials and feminine hygiene products. She
also is an inventor who holds several patents.

JUSTICES TO DECIDE LEGALITY OF TESTING PREGNANT WOMEN FOR DRUGS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By STEVE LASH 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Supreme Court on Monday agreed to decide if the
constitutional rights of expectant mothers are violated when a
hospital tests them, without their consent, for illegal drug use
and gives the results to law enforcement.
</P>
<P>
   Ten pregnant women who tested positive for cocaine use in a
Charleston, S.C., hospital are challenging the facility's
since-suspended policy as a violation of their right against
unreasonable searches by police. The women _ nine of whom are black
and one is white _ are suing the city, police and hospital
administrators alleging they violated the women's Fourth Amendment
rights.
</P>
<P>
   The nine black women were subsequently arrested but agreed to
attend drug-treatment programs instead of facing prosecution. The
white woman was not arrested, prompting the women to say the policy
targets blacks.
</P>
<P>
   The issue of racial discrimination, although not alleged
directly in the Supreme Court appeal, was an impetus for the
policy, the women argue. They noted the policy was in force at only
one hospital, the Medical University of South Carolina Medical
Center, which serves a predominantly black population.
</P>
<P>
   The policy was implemented in 1989, a time when the scourge of
crack cocaine, an inexpensive by-product of the harmful drug, began
afflicting primarily low-income, black communities. News broadcasts
were rife with stories of ``crack babies'' being born with
deformities or addicted to the drug their mothers took during
pregnancy.
</P>
<P>
   But the city, which says race was not an issue, counters that
the Constitution permits the drug tests and their disclosure
because they are so critically necessary to protect the health of
expectant mothers and their unborn. In its brief to the justices,
the city called cocaine use by expectant mothers a ``national
epidemic'' that has been linked to miscarriages, stillbirths and a
host of congenital problems.
</P>
<P>
   Charleston, in its brief, said that an expectant mother's use of
cocaine can cause birth defects, including damage to the brain,
kidneys and reproductive systems; increased risk of infant death;
low birth weight; seizures; strokes; heart attacks; behavioral
problems; and learning disabilities.
</P>
<P>
   The medical cost for treating babies born to a mother who used
cocaine can exceed $1 million during the life of the child,
including $50,000 in the first year, Charleston argued.
</P>
<P>
   In the late 1980s, about 15,000 babies in South Carolina
annually suffered ill effects from prenatal exposure to illegal
drugs, the city said.
</P>
<P>
   Charleston's argument has been victorious so far, as the 4th
U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled last year that the city's
desire to protect the health of the unborn superseded the women's
right to have drug tests kept confidential. The women then appealed
to the Supreme Court, which is expected to render its decision by
July 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Under the city's policy, which was suspended in 1993 due to the
litigation, only pregnant women suspected of illegal drug use are
tested. Expectant mothers arouse suspicion from health care workers
under the policy by seeking little, late or no prenatal care;
having a history of drug or alcohol abuse; or going into early
labor for ``no obvious'' reason.
</P>
<P>
   After first testing positive, the women are given information on
the harmful effects of drug use on themselves and their unborn and
referred to drug counseling. The hospital will notify the local
prosecutor's office only if the women fail a second drug test or
decline to attend the counseling sessions or prenatal medical
appointments.
</P>
<P>
   Women arrested under the policy could be charged with drug
possession, child neglect or distribution of drugs to a child.
Under state law, a fetus is considered a child if the pregnancy had
progressed to the point of viability, or when a fetus could survive
outside the womb.
</P>
<P>
   The 10 women also argued that the policy unconstitutionally
permits police, in cooperation with hospital staff, to conduct
warrantless searches for drug use.
</P>
<P>
   The policy, if upheld, could lead to a host of other police
efforts to skirt the Fourth Amendment by subjecting unconsenting
citizens to warrantless searches under the guise of protecting
their health and safety, the women argued. For example, hospital
workers submitted the drug tests to the police secretly, after
leading the women to believe results would remain confidential,
they added.
</P>
<P>
   In their brief, the women also said several new mothers arrested
under the policy were placed in custody ``while still bleeding,
weak and in pain from having just given birth.''
</P>
<P>
   The American Public Health Association, joined by other medical
groups, filed a brief urging the justices to hear the women's
appeal.
</P>
<P>
   The groups argued that the threat of prosecution under the
policy would upset the trust patients must have in their doctors
and discourage pregnant women from seeking prenatal care.
</P>
<P>
   But Charleston countered that its policy of telling law
enforcement of failed drug tests is a justifiable way to protect
the health of pregnant women and their unborn by encouraging
expectant mothers to seek early treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 253 patients who tested positive for drug use under the
policy, only 30 were subsequently arrested. Of those 30, only two
were prosecuted, and they were sentenced to probation and ordered
to complete drug treatment, the city said in its brief.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, the court also:
</P>
<P>
   _ Cleared the way for the federal government to deport Ferdinand
Hammer, 78, of Michigan, who it said guarded two Nazi concentration
camps during World War II.
</P>
<P>
   _ Rejected without comment a bank executive's effort to
reinstate a $10 million libel award against ABC-TV. Alan Levan,
chairman of BFC Financial Corp., said the network's news show
``20/20'' portrayed him and BFC as having taken advantage of
investors.

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ending one of the most extraordinary careers in American
finance, John S. Reed, co-chief executive of financial services at
the giant Citigroup, said Monday that he plans to retire on April
18 after the company's annual meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Upon the departure of the 61-year-old Reed, the chief
executive's reins at the company will be held solely by Sanford I.
Weill, who helped Reed orchestrate the megamerger of Reed's
Citicorp and Weill's Travelers Group to create Citigroup in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Weill, 66, suggested that he may retire from the company in two
years, at which time he hopes that a new chief executive will be
named.
</P>
<P>
   Former Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin, who was named to a
non-executive, senior position at Citigroup late last year
reiterated that he will not be a candidate for the job. ``I said I
had no intention of being the CEO and I will not be the CEO,''
Rubin said in an interview Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Reed's retirement was not forced by the bank's board, nor did it
arise from any personal animosity between Weill and Reed, according
to both executives and to others at Citigroup. Instead, the move
was a recognition that power-sharing at the top of Citigroup was
failing badly and was a poor way to manage a complex, globally
based corporation still beset by internal turf wars resulting from
the merger.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Reed's departure only signals that similar, hard-minded
decisions about how to manage Citigroup effectively still lie
ahead. ``There are too many coaches and people have been
complaining,'' said a senior Citigroup executive who requested
anonymity. ``It hasn't been a pleasant place to work.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, turf battles haven't prevented Citigroup from turning in
superior financial results at a time when many other big banks have
stumbled badly. Although Citigroup has not met the earnings targets
promised when the merger was announced, it has already demonstrated
that it has the ability to pump out billions of dollars in profits
each quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Reed's announcement was sudden, but not entirely a surprise.
Last year he and Weill divided their managerial duties. Reed was
given authority over Citigroup's Internet strategy and other
technology initiatives. Weill, in a move that cemented his power at
Citigroup, was given the corporate equivalent of the crown jewels:
responsibility for supervision of all other operational lines at
the bank and the all-important right to determine compensation
packages for his managers.
</P>
<P>
   At that point, Weill had essentially outmaneuvered Reed, a view
held by many at the company and on Wall Street, although one that
Reed, a wily corporate survivor, may not have shared.
</P>
<P>
   Guessing about Weill's possible successor was the game of the
day on Wall Street Monday, and many inside and outside Citigroup
speculated that the issue would ultimately be resolved through a
merger. In that regard, American Express' well-regarded president
and designated chief executive, Kenneth I. Chenault, is a
particularly compelling candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Bringing Chenault on board would represent a trifecta for Weill.
American Express has considered merging with Citigroup in the past,
and a deal would beef up Citigroup's already gargantuan credit-card
portfolio and card-processing network; Weill has long espoused the
need for greater black representation on Wall Street, and Chenault
is black; and Weill left American Express in the 1980s after a
falling-out with then chairman James Robinson, so buying American
Express would be a dramatic finish to a career of deal-making for
Weill.
</P>
<P>
   American Express said its policy is not to comment on ``market
rumors.'' Chenault does not take over as chief executive at
American Express until next year, and if a deal is made with
Citigroup, it is likely to happen after that.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Jay S. Fishman, head of Citigroup's property and casualty
insurance unit, is seen by many Citigroup insiders as a strong
internal candidate to succeed Weill. Some analysts also thought
that Rubin's thinking on the matter might evolve, despite his firm
denials.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Citigroup rose $1, or 2 percent, to $49, in extremely
heavy trading _ an implicit signal by the market that Reed's
retirement is a strong step toward resolving some of the company's
managerial woes.
</P>
<P>
   That said, Reed leaves Citigroup after a 35-year career in which
he wore and bore the mantle of a wunderkind after becoming
Citicorp's chief executive in 1984 when he was just 45. His career
has witnessed giddy highs and some notable lows, but it ends on a
note of unique accomplishment in an industry that has sorely lacked
visionaries and risk-takers such as Reed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We saw the world change,'' Reed said in an interview Monday,
noting how banking has been transformed by innovation and by the
blurring of traditional lines between commercial and investment
banking _ a shift marked by the creation of Citigroup. ``When I
started in this business, we had fixed-rate loans and played a lot
of golf.''
</P>
<P>
   The polestars of Reed's business life at Citicorp were a
fascination with consumer banking and a strong international bent.
To achieve his goals, he went in many different directions: hired
marketing wizards with no banking experience; coolly churned
through a series of talented executives before leaving them by the
wayside; pursued with monkish determination such nascent banking
technologies as automated teller machines; and ignored, and then
sharply scaled down, a once formidable corporate banking business
that nearly brought Citicorp to ruin in the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   The final act of his career, and one that was characteristically
risky, was the merger with Travelers, a move that created the
world's largest financial services concern, recommitted Citicorp to
corporate banking, and hitched the merged company's fortunes to the
unproved virtues of cross-selling financial products.
</P>
<P>
   Reed said in an interview Monday that his fondest memories of
the bank will be the consumer business he built and the people he
worked with _ the latter being a surprising comment from someone
who has often had a somewhat eccentric detachment from his
colleagues. He said his worst memories were of the real-estate and
international lending fiascos that left the bank teetering in the
early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Reed's decision to retire began in conversations with Weill
after Citigroup's board meeting about five weeks ago and continued
through a recent management retreat in Arizona. Reed and Weill
presented the decision at a meeting with Citigroup's board on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Although some at Citigroup said the board meeting was rancorous,
Reed, an engineer by training, said he made the decision for one
reason: because it made sense. In that capacity, Reed will leave
the banking industry as he once came in _ coolly analytic and
rational.

BRADLEY SUPPORTERS IN NEW YORK QUESTION STRATEGY, CHANCES IN
PRIMARY

<TEXT>
<P>
   With the New York primary just one week away, many of Bill
Bradley's top supporters have become bewildered by his strategic
decisions and pessimistic about his chances in a state that had
once been seen as the vanguard of his presidential hopes. Bradley's
decision to spend six consecutive days in Washington state is
increasingly being viewed as an emblem of a campaign that has lost
its way.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is he doing in Washington? Nobody knows,'' one of his
senior New York supporters said, simmering with frustration. ``He
should be in New York. We have made the best case we could. I don't
understand it. There's nothing to win in Washington,'' the aide
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you find out why they are there, please let me know,'' said
Ed Koch, the former mayor of New York, reflecting what has become
the consensus among state Democrats who had once enthusiastically
defied the party establishment in New York to endorse Bradley. ``If
you look at it, and you want to be honest, you have to say that
things are getting worse, not better.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, the retiring Democrat of New York
and Bradley's most prominent supporter in the state, has repeatedly
expressed his frustration to Bradley and his associates in recent
days, but to no avail, according to Bradley's advisers.
</P>
<P>
   Moynihan said that he still believed Bradley could win, but only
if he returned to New York, and that a victory there was essential
to the future of his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``He absolutely has to win New York,'' Moynihan said. He
asserted that a victory remained possible, but added, ``it will
take intensive campaigning.''
</P>
<P>
   As of Monday, Bradley had not announced a date for returning
East. He campaigned in Seattle before heading for California in
preparation for a debate there Wednesday. Vice President Al Gore,
Bradley's opponent, was in New York last Thursday, and plans to be
in the state for parts of Thursday, Saturday, Sunday and Monday, an
aide said Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   In focusing on Washington, Bradley's aides have argued that the
former senator needed to win an election to be taken seriously, and
that Washington appeared to offer the chance for that. And Bradley,
speaking at a women's health clinic in Seattle Monday, dismissed
the complaints, arguing that he had maintained a regular, if
long-distance, presence in New York state through paid
advertisements and satellite television.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been everywhere, while I've been here,'' Bradley said.
``And that's one of the advantages of politics today.''
</P>
<P>
   It is not unusual in presidential campaigns for leaders in one
state to grouse that their candidate is spending too much time in
others. But Bradley's decision to devote so much attention to a
contest that most Democrats view as marginal _ it is a nonbinding
vote; no delegates will be chosen _ has shaken some supporters.
</P>
<P>
   That is particularly because many believe that their candidate
has _ though some now say had _ a real chance of defeating Gore in
New York, if he had devoted a significant amount of time and energy
there.
</P>
<P>
   It was once difficult to imagine a state more hospitable to
Bradley and his campaign than New York. The former senator from New
Jersey is the popular sports hero from the state next door, the
kind of earnest Democrat that does well with New York's primary
voters. And he is running against a Southerner, giving him a
cultural advantage in this resolutely Northern electorate.
</P>
<P>
   Polls had once suggested that New York was a state where Bradley
might indeed defeat the vice president. But a New York Times/CBS
News poll of registered Democrats in New York, taken from Thursday
through Sunday, when Bradley was moving his small campaign troupe
from one side of Washington to the other, found Gore with a
26-point advantage over Bradley, with 55 percent, compared to 29
percent. (The poll of 382 Democratic primary voters had a margin of
sampling error of plus or minus 5 percentage points.) In October,
by contrast, a Times/CBS poll found Gore had 42 percent, with 37
percent for Bradley, a statistically insignificant difference.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know that there are many New Yorkers who take significant
exception to this strategy,'' said Jacques DeGraff, Bradley's
deputy campaign manager and the head of the New York effort. ``I
recognize that.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he were defending or endorsing the strategy, DeGraff
just sighed. ``I accept it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's national press secretary, Eric Hauser, speaking from
Washington  &QR; 
state, said that Bradley had decided to turn his attention there
after concluding he would be unable to win attention in New York,
California or any of the other large states holding primaries on
March 7, because of the amount of interest in the Republican
contest between Gov. George W. Bush and Sen. John McCain.
</P>
<P>
   The calculation, Hauser said, was that a strong showing in
Washington would light a fire of interest under Bradley's
languishing candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Quite frankly, if we can do really well here in Washington,
and make up a lot of the ground that we're behind, if we can
actually win the state, there could be nothing more helpful in New
York,'' Hauser said. ``If we can win out here, it will create a big
surge.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   But a number of factors would appear to be working against what
Rep. Jerrold Nadler, the Manhattan Democrat supporting Bradley,
unenthusiastically described as Bradley's ``Hail Mary pass.'' For
one thing, the contest in Washington has attracted little attention
so far. In addition, three Republican primaries are taking place
Tuesday and given the intense interest evoked by the Republican
competition, they seem certain to overshadow a Democratic contest
where not a single delegate will be selected.
</P>
<P>
   Even if Bradley wins Tuesday night, it has the potential of
being a shot fired but not heard. The polls in Washington close
after the evening news, and after the first round of deadlines for
East Coast newspapers. On Wednesday, when Bradley might have hopes
of a rebound, he is scheduled to engage in a debate with Gore, the
last before the March 7 primaries, which will almost certainly
compete with the Washington results for attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sure it will make a difference anywhere,'' said Tony
Bullock, Moynihan's chief of staff and one of the Bradley
supporters who have been critical of the strategy.
</P>
<P>
   In questioning Bradley's actions, his New York supporters spoke
more in anguish than anger, reluctant to criticize a public figure
that they said they admired, particularly during a time of obvious
strife. Several said they recognized that his campaign was running
out of options, and said they were reluctant to second-guess the
decisions it had made.
</P>
<P>
   But Koch said he could not resist suggesting how Bradley might
have stopped this from being an opportunity lost. ``Get out on the
street,'' Koch said. ``Creating a tumult. Putting his presence on
the map.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael J. Del Giudice, a co-chairman of Bradley's New York
campaign, said he had accepted the decision made by the candidate
and was doing his best to make it work.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to second-guess the national campaign,'' he said
over the weekend, which he spent not at campaign headquarters but
at his weekend home upstate. ``They made a judgment, and we're
going forward.''

FOR AIRLINES, INTERNET ISN'T JUST A FARE FINDER  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, MARCH 5) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By DAVID CAY JOHNSTON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   From comparison shopping for fares to giving passengers timely
information on delayed or canceled flights, the airlines say that
the Internet is proving to be a valuable tool that reduces business
costs and speeds information. Eventually, the airlines say, it will
even change how crowds move through airports. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Among the latest developments is a plan by four American
airlines _ Continental, Delta, Northwest and United _ and 23 others
that have since joined in, to operate a Web site where consumers
can shop for fares on all 27 airlines and, eventually they hope,
all other airlines as well. The site has yet to be named, but it is
expected to be launched in late spring, and may eventually sell
shares to the public. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Ben Burnett, a vice president of the Boston Consulting Group,
which is managing the startup, said that each airline would
independently set fares and that the site would present
side-by-side the best fares available, including specials that each
airline now only offers at its own Web site and that are often 5
percent to 10 percent lower than the lowest published fares.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe the site will give more choices to the consumer,''
Burnett said &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Most major airlines already know one another's published fares,
because each participates in the four major reservations systems _
Amadeus, Galileo, Sabre and Worldspan. The airlines hope to sell
more seats on the new Web site and wean ever more customers from
travel agents, who charge the airlines commissions. Taking
reservations by phone, they say, is also more expensive than having
individuals make their own online arrangements.
</P>
<P>
   The airlines are trying to lure customers to their Web sites by
giving out inexpensive benefits, like extra frequent flier miles,
for buying e-tickets online.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone in the airline industry supports the joint Web
site. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``When airlines decide to work together, consumers should
beware,'' said Richard Branson, the founder of Virgin Atlantic
Airlines, which is not involved in the project. ``Airlines'
creating an Internet site together is generally anticompetitive, or
could become anticompetitive.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In time, others are expected to follow Continental and Alaska
Airlines in installing airport kiosks, connected to the Internet,
where passengers can buy tickets, select seating and obtain
boarding passes. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Internet is also proving useful in other ways, some not so
obvious to passengers. When a January 1999 storm shut down Midwest
airports, stranding some passengers on grounded planes in Detroit
for more than five hours, United Airlines used the Internet to
announce to employees and passengers much more rapidly than ever
what decisions they made about which flights to cancel and how to
reroute passengers.
</P>
<P>
   The computer took less than a second to decide which flights to
cancel, which planes to reposition and to make other changes that
reduced the numbers of passengers stuck on planes by diverting them
to other airports, said Kurt Ebonhoch, a United spokesman. ``It
took us about 24 hours to get back to normal operations, not three
or four days'' as it would have a few years earlier, he said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As anyone who has tried to find out the status of a flight on a
day when weather interferes with schedules knows, airline workers
often lack accurate information, especially at the gate. But United
has integrated its flight information so thoroughly that when a
flight from Omaha to Chicago is canceled by officials in Nebraska,
the arrival and departure boards in the airports at both cities are
automatically updated within seconds. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   While that kind of coordination of information may take years to
become a standard at the airlines, a related service made possible
by the Internet is being adopted much more quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Continental, Northwest and United now instantly send notices
about delayed and canceled flights by e-mail to passengers who sign
up for this free service at their Web sites; other airlines are
expected to follow quickly. Those passengers whose e-mail is
integrated with their pagers or cell phones get the news about
delays or cancellations within moments. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``We see a lot of opportunity to use the Internet to reach out
to our mobile passengers,'' those who use cell phones and palm
computers, said Kevin McKenna, Continental's director of electronic
marketing. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Coming soon, McKenna said, are e-tickets allowing travel on more
than one airline and transfer to another airline when a flight is
canceled, as well as customized timetables that can be downloaded
to wireless hand-held computers and advanced cell phones. Such
timetables will allow passengers to see what other flights are
scheduled to their destination and to book a flight. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``The Internet means personalization, customization and actively
reaching out to you,'' McKenna said. ``These improvements will
mean, within 10 years, that when you arrive at the airport, you
will be able to check yourself in, and the only line you will have
to stand in is the one going down the aisle of the plane to your
seat.'' &QL;

   DENVER _ In all the hyperbole of political campaigns, it is rare
that a candidate gets quick, tangible results, but Vice President
Al Gore seems to have done it, persuading the nation's biggest
health insurance company to show more generosity to one of its
subscribers.
</P>
<P>
   Within 24 hours of Gore's appeal to the company, Aetna Inc., to
continue coverage for a 6-month-old baby born with severe brain
damage, the company agreed to do so, reversing an earlier decision.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Arthur N. Leibowitz, chief medical officer of Aetna US
Healthcare, a unit of Aetna Inc., said the company would continue
to cover private-duty skilled nursing care as long as the child
needed it.
</P>
<P>
   The child, Ian Malone of Everett, Wash., cannot eat or swallow
normally. He receives nutrition through a feeding tube and requires
continual assistance to help him breathe.
</P>
<P>
   On a campaign trip to Seattle on Sunday, Gore met with members
of the Malone family and then highlighted their plight in a speech.
</P>
<P>
   The boy's father, Dylan Malone, a graphic artist, rejoiced on
Monday. ``The vice president literally saved Ian's life,'' he said
in an interview. ``I couldn't have exposed Aetna's behavior without
Al Gore's help.''
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to Malone on Feb. 15, the regional director of Aetna
US Healthcare said, ``Ian does not qualify for the private duty
nursing care benefit'' offered under the family's health plan.
Aetna suggested that Malone and his wife, Christine, hire nurses or
provide sophisticated medical care to the baby themselves.
</P>
<P>
   In an earlier letter denying coverage, Aetna told Malone, ``This
is the final level of administrative appeal available to you under
your health plan, and this means that your administrative remedies
have been exhausted.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview on Monday, Leibowitz said: ``The vice
president's involvement and the publicity surrounding this case
over the weekend led us to make a decision in an expedited fashion.
We don't normally work on Sunday nights. These are truly agonizing
cases.''
</P>
<P>
   Malone said Aetna had suggested that he put his son up for
adoption so that the state or someone else could take financial
responsibility for Ian's medical care.
</P>
<P>
   But, Leibowitz, a pediatrician, said, ``It's a surprise to hear
that statement.'' He said he did not know what Ian's case manager
might have told the family, but he insisted that ``it is
absolutely, positively not'' the policy of the company to recommend
the adoption of children requiring expensive treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Malone said that an accident had occurred at the time of
Ian's birth, as he was delivered by a licensed midwife at a clinic.
</P>
<P>
   ``The midwife made several mistakes,'' and the baby was taken
immediately to a hospital for emergency care, she said.
</P>
<P>
   The Malone case comes amid a furious national debate over
managed health care and patients' rights. Both houses of Congress
passed bills last year defining a wide range of patients' rights,
including the right to appeal decisions denying coverage. The House
version, but not the Senate's, would also allow injured patients to
sue insurers and health maintenance organizations. Negotiators from
the two chambers will meet soon in an effort to iron out the
differences.
</P>
<P>
   The Malone case illustrates a question at the heart of the
national debate over patients' rights: What is the definition of
``medical necessity,'' and who defines what is medically necessary?
</P>
<P>
   At a rally on Monday in Denver, Gore said: ``It's time to say to
insurance companies and HMOs that decisions on health care must not
be made by the accountants and bureaucrats, who don't have a
license to practice medicine or to play God. The decisions should
be given back to doctors and nurses.''
</P>
<P>
   Chris Lehane, a spokesman for Gore, said that the vice president
called Leibowitz on Monday and thanked him for the company's latest
decision. Gore told Aetna that the marketplace often rewarded
companies for being compassionate and responsive to consumers,
Lehane said.

USE OF ILLEGAL NARCOTICS ON THE RISE IN MEXICO 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By MICHAEL RILEY 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ The 39-year old mother of three says there was no
way to escape the drug dealers who invaded her working-class
neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   ``On both sides of our house, they sell cocaine,'' says Elena,
who asked not to be otherwise identified. ``Many (parents) don't
let their children go outside, but you can't lock them in
forever.''
</P>
<P>
   As a result, she says her 19-year-old son became addicted to
what she calls ``little rocks'' _ crack cocaine.
</P>
<P>
   Now, once a week, she brings her son to a drug-treatment center.
Like many in this city of 20 million, the clinic is filled with
people seeking help for their addictions, mostly to cocaine,
according to counselors and medical personnel.
</P>
<P>
   ``Three years ago, it was hard to find a patient here using
cocaine,'' said Marta Gutierrez, director of a treatment center in
Ixtapalapa, a poor neighborhood on Mexico City's south side. ``Now,
it is hard to find a patient who is not using it.''
</P>
<P>
   As the Clinton administration nears a Wednesday deadline to
decide which countries to certify as drug-war allies, it is
becoming increasingly apparent that what has long been considered a
U.S. problem is now becoming a challenge for a growing number of
Mexican families. Government reports and accounts by drug
counselors and medical personnel suggest that use of illegal
narcotics is on the rise in Mexico and that cocaine has become the
No. 1 drug.
</P>
<P>
   A Mexican Health Department survey published last year concluded
that illegal drug use among the population increased 56 percent in
the previous five years, although the number of users is far lower
than in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Another study by the nongovernmental Center for Juvenile
Integration reported that the percentage of its young patients
using cocaine had jumped from 10 percent in 1990 to 60 percent in
1998.
</P>
<P>
   Jesus Cabrera, who directs the center, says that cocaine now has
become the drug most commonly treated at his 73 rehabilitation
centers throughout Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   In a tour through Latin America last year, U.S. drug czar Barry
McCaffrey told the region's leaders that narcotics consumption was
no longer just a U.S. problem. Countries such as Mexico cannot be
bases for America's drug suppliers without also getting burned, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   With more children and young adults showing up at drug-treatment
centers, Mexicans are viewing the drug war in a new light, analysts
say.
</P>
<P>
   ``Three or four years ago, kids weren't being affected,'' says
Jose Garcia, a drug-war expert at New Mexico State University.
``Mexicans weren't seeing this stuff on the street, or seeing
people drugged-up all over the place.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ironically,'' he says, ``that may ultimately be the key to
undoing the (drug-trafficking) cartels themselves, because of the
(growing) public backlash.''
</P>
<P>
   Ixtapalapa is often used as a testing ground for government
programs on domestic violence or teen-age pregnancy because
officials believe that the area usually is the first to see the
city's social trends.
</P>
<P>
   But Ixtapalapa points to a desperate future for the drug war.
The number of patients entering the neighborhood drug treatment
center has nearly tripled in the last year, and workers at the
clinic say the streets are dominated by gangs that are selling the
drug to schoolchildren as well as adults.
</P>
<P>
   ``The gangs are hanging out more around schools,'' said
Gutierrez, the treatment center's director. ``Now they are
threatening children to get them to sell drugs inside the schools,
where the police don't go.''
</P>
<P>
   She says children as young as 11 have entered her center for
treatment of cocaine addictions.
</P>
<P>
   Cocaine is relatively cheap and plentiful in Mexico City,
officials and drug counselors say. A gram of the drug costs about
$20 on the streets, compared to a reported range of $80 to $150 a
gram in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts say that the United States may have inadvertently
contributed to the upsurge in drug use by pushing Mexico to tow the
line in the fight against drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people talk about an informal agreement between the
(drug) cartels and the Mexican government. The government wouldn't
come down too hard on the traffickers, and they in turn wouldn't
put drugs on the streets in Mexico,'' says Sigrid Arzt, a
drug-trade researcher at the University of Miami. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; But U.S. pressure to crack down on the cartels may have led
Mexican authorities to violate that understanding, Arzt says, and
the cartels began selling on the streets.
</P>
<P>
   Although Mexico is expected to win certification easily as a
reliable drug-war partner this year, Washington's annual ritual and
its sometimes raucous debate in Congress still rankle many here.
They view it as yet another example of the United States'
insensitivity and heavy handedness toward its southern neighbor.
</P>
<P>
   The countries not certified by the administration, or by
Congress during its review, face economic sanctions and the loss of
U.S. aid, although the penalties can be waived.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of Mexico's drug strategies say its anti-narcotics
budget focuses on big operations against the cartels to the
detriment of the neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   The Mexican government, they say, spent $170 million last year
on drug interdiction, much of it to acquire new ships, helicopters
and satellite tracking technology _ all of it little use in
fighting street drugs. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; ``All the money is going into interception, seizures and
arresting the big fish in the cartels, but that is a response to
American pressure,'' Arzt says. ``The Americans couldn't care less
what is happening on Mexico's streets.'' &UR;

HEALTH WEB SITES MAY BE TRADING DATA 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KAREN HSU  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Some of the most popular consumer sites on the Internet that
dispense medical information may be exchanging personal data about
users who visit there, in possible violation of antitrust laws,
consumer and government officials say.
</P>
<P>
   The sites, which often rely heavily on surveys visitors are
asked to fill out online, gather a wealth of information on the
health, medical history, prescription drug use, and other personal
information. Most of that information is given up voluntarily by
visitors to the site, but some of it is not, and few users realize
that the information could be traded or sold to other Internet
health-care sites.
</P>
<P>
   Several recent studies have confirmed that personal data is
being captured and exchanged with other companies, and the Federal
Trade Commission is reportedly investigating.
</P>
<P>
   Richard M. Smith, a noted Internet security specialist, said he
nearly fell out of his chair when he found out a medical Web site,
PersonalMD.com, had given his ZIP code to an advertiser on the site
without his permission or knowledge. He wouldn't have realized it
had he not known how to check the background coding instructions
for the Web page. An internal program apparently knew who to access
the information off Smith's computer and send it to the advertiser,
Doubleclick.com.
</P>
<P>
   ``Usually sites are more subtle about what they send out,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   As the number of various Web sites has exploded, including
17,000 health-oriented sites that sell products and conduct
interactive health surveys, the whole area of privacy has not kept
pace, Smith said. Some sites include services such as keeping
entire medical records online or sending medication reminders.
</P>
<P>
   Smith and others worked on a report commissioned by the
California Health Care Foundation that was released a month ago.
The report focused on privacy with 21 of the most popular health
Web sites, and found that many of them violated their own privacy
policies.
</P>
<P>
   One of the Web sites highlighted in the report was OnHealth
Network Co, which offered a survey called a Personal Health
Assessment. But what OnHealth didn't inform users was that an
outside vendor called WellMed collected the information for the
survey.
</P>
<P>
   ``OnHealth intentionally tried to hide the role of WellMed in
all this. So you are typing in all this data, which is immediately
going off to another company that you don't have a relationship
with,'' Smith said. After the report came out, the Personal Health
Assessment survey was discontinued.
</P>
<P>
   To add confusion last week, OnHealth was bought by
Healtheon/WebMD Corp., another Internet health-care company. A
spokeswoman for WebMD said that the OnHealth Web site will
eventually merge into WebMD.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't know who owns the data anymore,'' said Zoe Hudson,
senior policy analyst at Georgetown University's Health Privacy
Project who was a co-author of the report. ``You thought you gave
the information to OnHealth, but now it's changing hands. This
merger may not concern the consumer, but it might matter if one of
those sites joined forces with their insurance company.''
</P>
<P>
   Hudson said that because health sites ask for more detailed
information than many other sites, she expected that the privacy
protection would be better. ``We were all surprised at the amount
that was leaving the site,'' Hudson said.
</P>
<P>
   According to another study of 1,009 US adults by the California
Health Care Foundation in January, it found 75 percent of them
concerned about health Web sites sharing information without their
permission. Some sites currently collect information such as Social
Security numbers, credit card numbers, lab results and insurance
information.
</P>
<P>
   Since the report come out, a few companies, including
HealthCentral.com and iVillage.com, have said that the FTC has
inquired about their privacy practices. In addition, industry and
government leaders have met to work on privacy Internet issues. In
1996, a coalition of ethicists, physicians and online providers
formed the Internet Healthcare Coalition, which recently endorsed a
draft of an International e-Health Code of Ethics. Another group of
for-profit health providers have also formed a group called
Hi-Ethics Alliance.
</P>
<P>
   Representatives of both groups and Smith were in Washington last
Friday to testify before a Congressional subcomittee on privacy and
confidentiality about health Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do think that in the spring, we will be seeing a lot more
activity in self-regulation with privacy,'' said John Mack,
president of the Internet Healthcare Coalition.
</P>
<P>
   ``Privacy is a big issue for us. If we lose consumers' trust,
then we have lost the site,'' said Laura Hicks, a spokeswoman for
drkoop.com, which was profiled in Smith's report.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's sort of unexpected that we are being monitored and
watched in this way. We think it's like a newspaper or a magazine,
but it's much more invasive,'' said Smith, who warns that it is
possible to put together a profile of a user from all the
information gathered by different companies.
</P>
<P>
   Since the report, some e-health companies are already changing
or clarifying their policies. For example, drkoop.com said that it
has rewritten the privacy policy so it is more consumer-friendly.
It has added information, such as how servers keep logs of sites.

<P>
   SEATTLE _ To Californians, it was all a little baffling. Why
would Sen. John McCain pull out of the only Republican debate
scheduled in the nation's largest state the week before the
highest-stakes primary on the political calendar?
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't fathom it for a moment,'' said Zev Yaroslavsky, a
Democrat on the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors. ``It's
been promoted quite a bit already, and to me, even though it's in
California, it's a national debate. McCain must feel he has a
darned good reason for pulling out of what is the last debate
before Super Tuesday. But I don't get it.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain's decision to withdraw from the forum this Thursday in
Los Angeles took everyone by surprise, including the debate's
sponsors, CNN and The Los Angeles Times, which appeared to be
holding out hope Monday that McCain would reconsider. It also
caused dissension in McCain's own campaign: His communications
director, Daniel Schnur, was quoted in several California
newspapers Monday as saying that the withdrawal was ``definitely a
mistake'' and ``a tactical error at the staff level.''
</P>
<P>
   Aides to McCain announced on Sunday that he was pulling out of
the event to campaign in New York, which also holds a primary on
March 7. They complained that while they agreed to the encounter
weeks ago, their opponent, Gov. George W. Bush, only consented last
Wednesday, the day after his losses in Michigan and Arizona, and by
then, McCain had made other plans.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Murphy, McCain's senior strategist, said the campaign had
decided to stick to its new schedule _ which includes a ride Friday
on McCain's Straight Talk Express campaign bus by the ``Today''
show _ because it offers far more free media exposure. ``I'm going
for the bigger ratings, the bigger audience,'' Murphy said. Howard
Opinsky, a McCain spokesman, added that the campaign suggested
instead that the two debate on NBC's ``Meet the Press'' this
Sunday, in Buffalo, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   But aides to Bush were happy to reinforce the impression being
left in California that with polls showing the governor with a huge
lead among Republican voters, McCain decided to head east, where
his chances looked better on March 7. New York, Massachusetts and
Rhode Island are among the states in which the senator has said he
expects a strong showing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know how you can interpret it,'' said Gerry Parsky,
the Bush campaign chairman in California, ``other than that the
McCain campaign is writing off California or treating it much less
importantly.'' Ari Fleischer, a Bush campaign spokesman, said, ``I
don't think he had a scheduling conflict; he had a polling
conflict.''
</P>
<P>
   Some Republican tacticians were troubled by McCain's pullout.
The Los Angeles debates _ the Democrats are to go head to head in a
similar forum on Wednesday _ were expected to be galvanizing
encounters in a diffuse week of campaigning. The tacticians
wondered if McCain's action would hurt his standing among those
drawn to his candidacy because he seems different from other
politicians.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's much more dangerous for McCain because McCain voters want
to see him,'' said Frank Luntz, a Republican pollster. ``There's an
intensity to the McCain voter who is highly nterested in the
campaign and anxiously wants to hear everything he has to say. They
are more likely to be turned off than a typical Bush supporter.''
</P>
<P>
   If timing is everything, the withdrawal could not have come at a
less desirable juncture for McCain in the battle for the 162
delegates in California's winner-takes-all Republican balloting; it
has forced him into the defensive argument that he is not conceding
California, when, in fact, the campaign has devoted a lot of time
and money to the state.
</P>
<P>
   John Weaver, McCain's political director, said the campaign was
spending $3 million on advertising in California, the largest
commitment it was making anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   Despite McCain's action, the news organizations said the forum
would go on with Bush and Alan Keyes participating. It was not
clear, however, if the sponsors would allow McCain to participate
from a remote location, as he did for an earlier debate in Phoenix,
or if they would opt for a theatrical flourish and set up a chair
or podium for him, on the off chance of a last-minute entrance.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush campaign seemed to support the idea. Fleischer said
that before Bush had agreed to participate, the organizers were
threatening to do the same to him: ``When we were advising The Los
Angeles Times that we could not give them a decision, they said it
would be McCain, Keyes and an empty chair.''

 POLL SHOWS CLOSE RACE BETWEEN BUSH AND McCAIN IN NEW YORK  
(sw) 
 By MARJORIE CONNELLY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The battle for the Republican presidential nomination remains
tight in New York state, and most voters might still change their
minds, according to the latest New York Times/CBS News Poll.
</P>
<P>
   Among registered Republicans who say they would probably or
definitely vote on March 7, 46 percent support Gov. George W. Bush
of Texas and 36 percent favor Sen. John McCain of Arizona. Alan
Keyes is preferred by 3 percent, and 15 percent have not yet
decided.
</P>
<P>
   The statewide telephone poll was conducted Thursday through
Sunday with 1,034 registered voters, of whom 281 said they were
Republican primary voters. Since there is a margin of sampling
error of plus or minus 6 percentage points for each candidate, a
candidate needs to be ahead by at least 12 points for the lead to
be statistically significant.
</P>
<P>
   Half of McCain's supporters consider their minds made up, but
two-thirds of the Republicans who favor Bush said it was ``still
too early to say for sure.''
</P>
<P>
   Most New York voters favor an open primary, and almost half of
non-Republican voters in the state might vote in the Republican
primary next week if they could do so legally. McCain would receive
the support of 48 percent of these hypothetical non-Republican
primary voters and Bush would be the choice of 30 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans in New York state are almost evenly divided on
whether a Republican candidate who appeals to Democrats and
independents in open primaries has a better chance of attracting
voters across the board in the general election. with 42 percent
saying that drawing Democrats and independents during the primary
season will help in November and 39 percent saying it will not.

 &HT;    Ex-police chief fails to follow his own order to return $1,000
gift to church
 &HT;    By Alfred Charles
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Before leaving the department, former Fulton County
Police Chief Louis Graham told 100 of his officers they should not
spend $1,000 checks given to them by a church until questions about
their legality had been answered.
</P>
<P>
   But Graham retired from the department shortly after his order,
and took the check from World Changers Ministries with him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have not received a check from him,'' said police Chief
George Coleman, who took over the job when Graham retired in
November. ``There has been no statement that he is going to return
the money.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, 45 additional officers who received checks and
apparently cashed them, have missed a Feb. 14 deadline to return
the gifts.
</P>
<P>
   The officers have asked for an installment plan so they can
repay the money. Under county rules, the officers who don't comply
with the order to return the cash face a range of sanctions,
including termination.
</P>
<P>
   Coleman said county officials haven't yet agreed whether to
allow an installment plan or garnish the officers' pay.
</P>
<P>
   Graham, who could not be reached Monday for comment, left the
department before the Fulton County ethics board ruled in December
that the officers had to return the money. The board ruled that
keeping the money violated the county ethics code and advised the
officers to return it. The money will be returned to the church,
Coleman said.
</P>
<P>
   It is unclear what the county can do to force Graham and two
other officers who left the agency before the ruling to return the
money, said H. Michael Harvey, ethics board chairman.
</P>
<P>
   World Changers Ministries, a church led by the Rev. Creflo
Dollar, presented 100 south Fulton officers with $1,000 each during
a November breakfast last year to recognize their service to the
community.
</P>
<P>
   Before handing out the checks, Dollar was pulled over in October
by a Fulton County police officer and ticketed for running a red
light in his 1999 Jaguar and failing to have proof of insurance.
</P>
<P>
   Capt. K.L. Hawkings urged a magistrate to reduce the two
citations to warnings. Coleman said Monday that Hawkings, a 15-year
veteran, has been given a written reprimand, received additional
training on traffic ticket procedures and is subject to
reassignment for his actions.
</P>
<P>
   As of Monday, Coleman said:
</P>
<P>
   _ 48 officers have returned their checks.
</P>
<P>
   _ 45 have said they need an installment plan to return the
money.
</P>
<P>
   _ Three officers, including Graham, left the department before
the ethics board ruling.
</P>
<P>
   _ Two officers resigned their jobs, for unrelated reasons, after
the ruling. The department has sent them letters asking for the
money.
</P>
<P>
   _ Two officers have not responded to Coleman's request to return
the money and are being investigated by internal affairs.

BRASHEAR HAS LITTLE RECOLLECTION OF MCSORLEY BLOW

<P>
   His memory of the incident is nonexistent, which is certainly
understandable.
</P>
<P>
   Canucks forward Donald Brashear made his first public comments
during a news conference in Vancouver Monday and discussed his
feelings a week after Bruins defenseman Marty McSorley viciously
swung his stick and connected with Brashear's right temple.
McSorley was suspended for the remaining 23 games of the regular
season _ an NHL record for an on-ice incident _ as well as the
postseason and if he wants to return, he must apply to commissioner
Gary Bettman for reinstatement.
</P>
<P>
   Brashear, who suffered a Grade 3 concussion (the most severe),
is just trying to heal.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you watch the tape, you can see I was out before I fell on
the ice,'' said Brashear, who landed headfirst with his helmet half
on, half off.
</P>
<P>
   After the game, there were reports that Brashear was up and
about in the Canucks' medical room. Monday, he said he does
remember waking up, but wasn't sure where. He has headaches every
day, which is consistent with the degree of concussion he suffered,
and isn't supposed to exercise at all for a minimum of two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   He's expected to be sidelined for three weeks and depending on
how well he recovers, it could be quite a bit longer. Brashear said
he feels fortunate it wasn't much, much worse.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just happy that I can walk right now and be on my feet and
see my 4-month-old son, and keep living,'' said Brashear, who had
been playing the best hockey of his career. ``But I'm not going to
feel as good as when I'm going to be able to put my skates back on,
give a hit or take a hit, or get into a fight for my teammates. I'm
not going to change the way I play the game in any way.''
</P>
<P>
   McSorley expressed his deep remorse after the incident and
publicly apologized to Brashear. He also tried to privately
apologize to Brashear but was unsuccessful because Brashear wasn't
there to take the call. Brashear said it might not have mattered.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think I would have talked to him,'' he said.
``Sometimes I wonder what went through his mind to do a thing like
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Brashear was criticized for going to the Boston bench and
flexing his muscles in an effort to taunt the Bruins prior to the
incident. He said he didn't recall that.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's not much I remember,'' he said. ``But I remember that
was a game that I had to play hard, where I was just doing my job.
I remember we got into a fight right off the start. Those are all
things that I have to do during a game. In a game you try to make
people lose their focus by any different way. Certainly not be
hitting someone in the head with your stick.''
</P>
<P>
   The Vancouver police are in the midst of an investigation that
could lead to assault charges against McSorley, but Brashear said
he's not concerned with that.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not something I care about, that I think about every
day,'' he said. ``What I think about the most is getting healthy
and getting back in my skates.''

COMMISSIONER SELIG BANS STRAWBERRY FROM BASEBALL FOR ONE YEAR 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   TAMPA, Fla. _ Darryl Strawberry was suspended for one calendar
year Monday by the baseball commissioner Bud Selig, a ruling that
could signal the end of Strawberry's calamitous career.
</P>
<P>
   Strawberry flunked a drug test Jan. 19, his third violation of
baseball's drug aftercare program. Selig considered giving him a
chance to return sometime this season _ as he did last year, after
Strawberry's second violation _ but instead applied a firm penalty.
The earliest Strawberry could return to baseball would be Feb. 28,
2001, less than two weeks before his 39th birthday, and only if
Strawberry adheres to the terms of his aftercare program, including
stringent drug testing.
</P>
<P>
   Strawberry could not be reached for comment. Charisse
Strawberry, his wife, answered the phone at the couple's home here
Monday, and with emotion filling her voice, she declined comment.
</P>
<P>
   Selig met with Strawberry and his wife last week in his
Milwaukee office. ``I had no doubt that his remorse and sorrow were
genuine,'' Selig said, in a statement released by Major League
Baseball, ``and I worried about the effect my decision would have
on his health and the welfare of his family.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the end, I could not ignore Darryl's past infractions and
concluded that each of us must be held accountable for his or her
actions. I am hopeful that he will use the time away from the game
productively and will care for himself and his family.''
</P>
<P>
   The Major League Baseball Players Association is not expected to
contest the decision. Selig called George Steinbrenner, the
Yankees' owner, with his decision Monday afternoon, according to a
baseball official, and as Steinbrenner walked out of Legends Field,
he did not seem surprised or disappointed. ``That's the
commissioner's ruling, that's what we'll abide by,'' he said. ``My
hopes and prayers are with Darryl that he can hold his life
together, and make the changes he has to make and deal with this
thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Strawberry was expected to be the Yankees' designated hitter
against right-handed pitching this year, and after his electrifying
return to the team the last two months of last season, teammates
expected him to have a big year. His bat speed was incredible, he
looked great in his off-season workouts, and Bernie Williams and
others spoke of his hitting perhaps 25 to 30 home runs during the
2000 season.
</P>
<P>
   As he has so many times before in his career, Strawberry dashed
the recent hopes for him. But after teammates learned of his
suspension Monday, they preferred not to speculate on whether he
might play again. Rather, they fretted about what Strawberry would
do next, outside of baseball.
</P>
<P>
   They have come to know Strawberry, through the months of
traveling with him, playing alongside him, seeing him diagnosed
with colon cancer, seeing him sick as he went through chemotherapy.
They know Strawberry's four kids, and that Charisse Strawberry is
pregnant with another. They know how much he loves to play
baseball, how he thrived on those moments when the crowd chanted
and he had a chance to swing big.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got to start getting his life in order,'' said Derek
Jeter, the Yankees' shortstop. ``Now he knows what's ahead of him.
If baseball is still in his plans, he can deal with that later.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams called it ``a very sad situation. It seems like nothing
comes easy for him.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Paul O'Neill: ``He has a lot of close friends here, a lot
of friends who would help him any time he needed help. I don't
think anybody in here condones drug use by any means. But on a
personal level, there's a lot of people, including myself, that
would do anything they could to help him through this.''
</P>
<P>
   Scott Brosius' locker at Yankee Stadium was located only a few
feet from Strawberry's, and like Strawberry, he was part of the
team's prayer group. ``It's got to be a tough thing, because I'm
sure baseball was one of the things he was able to use to fight
this,'' said Brosius. ``Now, he's losing the ability to come to the
park, and not only work a job, but to cheer for guys who cheer for
him. There's a support thing there that may not be there on an
everyday basis. At this point, all we can hope for is that he gets
the support he needs, whether it's through us or wherever, and he
can just battle through this thing and look forward to things past
this.''
</P>
<P>
   Manager Joe Torre repeatedly mentioned how he hoped Strawberry
would find something else to focus on, something else to which he
could dedicate himself, now that he is out of baseball.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most important thing is, where do you proceed from
tomorrow on, without the ability to go out to the ballpark?'' Torre
said. ``That's the important thing right now for Darryl to
straighten out in his mind, and this is where the family takes on a
much more significant role.''
</P>
<P>
   Strawberry indicated to officials from Florida's Department of
Corrections that he is building a home in this area, and Strawberry
has served about half of an 18-month probation sentence he received
last year, following his arrest and plea of no contest, and he must
complete the last 50 hours of 100 hours of community service. After
Strawberry failed the drug test last month, state officials
recommended that he undergo increased evaluation, counseling and
testing; he is not faced with a jail term for his probation
violation.
</P>
<P>
   Strawberry, who has amassed significant debt, would have been
paid $750,000 in salary this year, and technically, he cannot
receive that money because he is not allowed to play baseball. But
Steinbrenner has looked after Strawberry since he gave the former
Met another chance in baseball in 1995, and he indicated last week
that he will continue to support him; presumably, that might
include some sort of financial assistance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure, Darryl can hit home runs, but I think George goes beyond
that with his feelings toward Darryl and his family,'' said Torre.
``I'm sure George is wounded by this thing. I'm sure the bigger
feeling is hoping that Darryl is going to be all right, and we
don't know that at this point.''

HAIDER QUITS PARTY LEADERSHIP POST 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By ROGER COHEN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN _ Bowing to international pressure, Joerg Haider resigned
Monday as leader of the anti-immigrant Freedom Party that he had
taken from a marginal fringe group to a powerful national force in
Austria over the past 14 years.
</P>
<P>
   The abrupt resignation, just three weeks after the Freedom Party
brought the ire of Europe down on Austria by joining a government
coalition, reflected the country's discomfort at its isolation. But
it also suggested a tactical maneuver consistent with Haider's long
history of keeping his opponents off balance.
</P>
<P>
   Haider, 50, has repeatedly changed strategy since becoming
leader of the Freedom Party in 1986, switching from attacks on the
European Union to pro-European statements, and directing his appeal
alternately to workers and business. In this light, his resignation
may prove to constitute one step back with a view to a more
vigorous advance.
</P>
<P>
   At the least, it will shield him from criticism if the coalition
with the conservative People's Party proves unpopular, while
allowing him to consolidate his credentials as governor of the
southern province of Carinthia. His ultimate aim almost certainly
remains to emerge as Austrian chancellor, should his party come to
dominate national politics.
</P>
<P>
   Announcing his resignation after an emergency party meeting
Monday night in Vienna, Austria, Haider said he did not ``want to
be seen as a shadow-chancellor'' and felt it essential to clarify
that the party's six ministers in the government were not looking
over their shoulders to ``get the approval of the man in
Carinthia.''
</P>
<P>
   Haider added that he felt overburdened with the twin jobs of
Carinthian governor and party leader. But he stated plainly, ``This
is not a withdrawal from politics.''
</P>
<P>
   His statement made no mention of Austria's diplomatic problems.
But the resignation was clearly linked to Austria's growing
realization that punitive measures imposed by the European Union
are serious, and that the country's plight could become acute if
the government does not do everything possible to break out of its
isolation.
</P>
<P>
   The 14 governments of the European Union that have frozen
relations with Austria and downgraded contacts with Austrian
ambassadors to a ``technical level'' will now face the delicate
task of deciding whether Haider's resignation removes the grounds
for these punitive measures.
</P>
<P>
   There was no immediate reaction from European governments, but
it appeared likely that, before making any decision, they would
wish to study what precise role Haider will now play. The character
of the Freedom Party has of course not changed overnight.
</P>
<P>
   The intrusion of the European Union on Austria's democratic
choice of government has set off a furious debate on the Continent
over the extent of national sovereignty in a union that has already
pooled its currencies.
</P>
<P>
   Haider, whose energetic and charismatic command over the party
has been little short of absolute, was replaced by one of his most
faithful lieutenants, the current vice chancellor, Susanne
Riess-Passer, 39. So fierce is her loyalty to Haider that she is
widely known in Austria as ``the King's cobra.''
</P>
<P>
   The life of the coalition has already been made extremely
difficult by a series of bristling remarks from Haider, who did not
himself join the government, for tactical reasons. The most
provocative of these _ and a possible reason for his resignation _
was a statement last week that Europe's new shared currency, the
euro, amounted to a ``miscarriage.''
</P>
<P>
   At a time when the euro is weak, and the new government of
Chancellor Wolfgang Schuessel has been trying to impress its
neighbors with its European good faith, Haider could scarcely have
made a more damaging comment.
</P>
<P>
   It coincided with a statement from a leading member of the
Freedom Party, Franz Rauter, that Austria should simply withdraw
from the European Union if the sanctions are not lifted.
</P>
<P>
   In effect, such remarks, pounced on by the Austrian press, made
the already difficult task of Schuessel close to impossible. The
coalition has already shown strains over economic policy,
particularly the issue of how severe austerity measures should be.
</P>
<P>
   The statement about the euro was typical of Haider's sometimes
reckless style, one that has seen him make isolated remarks
praising aspects of the Third Reich, including Hitler's labor
policy, only to turn around and apologize.
</P>
<P>
   But beneath this meandering, sometimes wayward political course,
a real nose for winning Austrian votes has always been evident.
Haider has won the following of the extreme right with his
intermittent revisionism, drawn in many workers by playing to their
fears about immigrants, and attracted entrepreneurs with a
free-market message.
</P>
<P>
   Haider, whose party won 27 percent of the vote in elections last
October and so broke up the 30-year-long domination of the Social
Democrats and People's Party, said that his resignation pointed to
a ``new orientation for the party.''
</P>
<P>
   He declined to be more specific, but it appeared that the
revisionist and xenophobic remarks that have earned the Freedom
Party notoriety will be excluded from the party's message in an
attempt to establish its credentials as a viable European
government force.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Martin Schmidt, a Freedom Party member and the Austrian
transport minister, said Haider's resignation amounted to ``one
step back, two steps forward.'' Peter Sichrovsky, a Freedom Party
member of the European Parliament, said Haider would now be able
``to prove his capacities as a future chancellor'' by concentrating
on his mandate in Carinthia.
</P>
<P>
   A small state tucked away in southern Austria is not likely to
satisfy Haider's ambitions, even if he manages to keep a low
profile for a spell.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview last week, Haider said: ``I am tired of this
stupid, noisy scene. After 30 years in government, the Social
Democratic party does not accept a change in Austrian democracy and
has been mobilizing all its friends around the world. They want to
break our government, but they won't.''
</P>
<P>
   Christa Zoechling, the author of a book about Haider, said: ``He
quit because he is hurt that foreign governments and media have not
accepted his apologies. He is tired of saying he is sorry and he
wants to be seen as a statesman. The only problem is that he is not
a statesman.''

COMMENTARY: EYES ON THE PRIZE 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   So China is now telling Taiwan: Marry me or I'll kill you. And
Vice President Al Gore is now telling the unions: Vote for me and
I'll get you a better deal with China next time, even though my own
administration negotiated this deal. And together they are making a
God-awful mess of what is a fundamental U.S. interest _ that
Congress ratify China's entry into the World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
   It's now going to be very tempting for Congress _ caught between
the right-wingers who have been energized by the threats from
Beijing against Taiwan and the left-wingers who have been energized
by Gore's ambivalent support for his own trade negotiators _ to
walk away from the Clinton deal for bringing China into the WTO.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing could be more reckless. This is the time to keep our
eyes on the prize, and the prize remains the stable, steady
transformation of China into a responsible member of the world
trading system and into a more free and open society. Few things
are more important for world stability than that.
</P>
<P>
   The best tool we have for advancing that _ not a foolproof tool,
not the only tool, but the best tool _ is to Gulliverize China by
globalizing China. And that's what this WTO deal helps to do _ by
requiring the Beijing government to permit more Chinese citizens to
do business directly with the outside world and be less dependent
on their own government, by requiring China to allow U.S. Internet
companies to own 50 percent of Internet start-ups in China, and by
requiring China to put in place trade rules where corrupt,
arbitrary officials now hold sway.
</P>
<P>
   The reason China's leaders cracked down this year is because
they are terrified that the personal freedoms the Chinese people
have gained in their lives and jobs during the last decade of
openness will lead to demands for more political freedom. And they
will _ especially with the WTO deal.
</P>
<P>
   That's why if ratifying this WTO accord now means looking past
China's bluster on Taiwan, then so be it. If ratifying this deal
now means ignoring the pandering of the vice president _ who knows
better, who actually understands globalization, and who should be,
and could be, the administration's most articulate, in-your-face
advocate of this deal, but who has bowed instead to the AFL-CIO and
its fatuous nonsense that you improve worker and environmental
standards abroad by dictating them to others, not by free-trading
with them _ then so be it.
</P>
<P>
   Even if it means ignoring the self-interested lobbying of the
U.S. Chamber of Commerce, which just wants WTO passage because it's
good for business _ then so be it. As the Council on Foreign
Relations expert Michael Mandelbaum says: ``Some things are in the
national interest even though the Chamber of Commerce believes
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Our choice with China is not between deterrence and engagement.
You always need both. ``China is not a threat to dominate Asia the
way the Soviet Union was a threat to dominate Europe,'' notes
Mandelbaum. ``It lacks the power, the ideology and the will. The
only place where China threatens U.S. interests is with Taiwan, and
there U.S. military power is tacitly deterring the Chinese and must
continue to do so.''
</P>
<P>
   But we keep this deterrence card hidden so as not to embolden
the sometimes reckless Taiwanese into thinking that they can
achieve independence and security without negotiating their
relationship with Beijing. China is bellowing now precisely because
it wants negotiations and is trying to strengthen its hand for
these inevitable talks. China is so dependent on Taiwan and America
today for investment and trade that it cannot afford to invade
Taiwan without paying a devastating price. China still may invade.
Countries do crazy things. But Beijing will think about it a lot
longer than you imagine.
</P>
<P>
   Strategy is about playing the odds. And since we are already
deterring China militarily, the odds say that the best way to
reinforce that is by bringing China into the WTO, increasing the
costs for Beijing of any military adventure, and fostering the
internal changes inside China that might one day make it more like
Taiwan, and therefore better able to solve its differences with
Taiwan peacefully.
</P>
<P>
   The odds are in our favor, if we play our cards smart. That
means understanding China's bluster for what it is, and it means
understanding Gore's pandering for what it is, and looking beyond
both with our eyes on the prize.

<P>
   Britain's secretary for Northern Ireland, Peter Mandelson, met
with Catholic and Protestant leaders in Belfast to try to unblock
the stalled peace agreement. Britain suspended the power-sharing
Ulster government Feb. 11 because of the Irish Republican Army's
refusal to start disarming. Sinn Fein's president, Gerry Adams,
said it was up to Britain to restore the administration. The Ulster
Unionist leader, David Trimble, said it was up to Sinn Fein to make
a move on IRA weapons first.

   BRITAIN: PASSPORTS FOR PETS
</P>
<P>
   Britain has begun allowing animals with ``pet passports''
proving that they are free of rabies to enter the country without
having to spend six months in quarantine. The animals must be
fitted with an identity microchip, and be vaccinated and tested by
a licensed veterinarian to ensure that the vaccine is working. If
there is no outbreak of rabies in Britain within the next year, the
plan, which applies to dogs and cats traveling to Britain from 22
western European countries, will be expanded to include pets from
the United States, Canada and the Caribbean.

Canadian officials off guard when he bolted from the airport in
Montreal for the Cuban Embassy in Ottawa, leaving his wife and

rival, Abdoulaye Wade, appeared to be able to garner the 50 percent
of the votes necessary to win in the first round.

 &HT;    Coke suit, release form tops agenda for blacks at church meeting
 &HT;    By Henry Unger
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ For the first time since the racial discrimination
lawsuit was filed nearly a year ago, black employees at Coca-Cola
appear to be mobilizing.
</P>
<P>
   Up until two weeks ago, most African-American employees sat on
the sidelines while lawyers battled in court and a few local civil
rights leaders expressed support for the suit.
</P>
<P>
   But now, more black employees may be getting involved, primarily
because the massive job cuts under way at Coca-Cola have changed
the dynamics of the situation. For laid-off African-American
employees, the suit and the job cuts have become intertwined,
forcing them to make a difficult decision.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, an organizer expects hundreds of current and former
employees to meet at St. Philip A.M.E. Church to discuss what may
become a galvanizing issue as the layoffs and lawsuit play out in
the ensuing months. This will be the second such meeting at the
church since mid-February, when some 150 employees attended,
according to a court document filed in the case recently.
</P>
<P>
   On the upcoming agenda: How to get the company to change its
position on a key issue. After the closed-door meeting, organizers
are to meet with the media.
</P>
<P>
   At the heart of the issue is a release form, or waiver, that all
laid off Coca-Cola employees _ black and white _ must sign to get
enhanced severance benefits from the company. To qualify for the
substantial benefits package, employees must relinquish their
rights to sue the company in the future.
</P>
<P>
   This comes at a particularly bad time for African-American
employees who were hoping to benefit from the racial bias suit if
it gets certified as a class-action case down the road. That
decision, which a judge will make, is at least several months away.
</P>
<P>
   But the layoffs are happening now _ so is the need to make a
decision on signing the release form.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Coca-Cola Co. is an unfriendly place to work for black
employees,'' said Larry Jones, who up until two weeks ago was a
human resources manager at the company. He is now the chief
organizer behind the employee meetings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Finally, we have an opportunity with this lawsuit to at least
get something out of this company,'' Jones said. ``Now comes the
realignment and the release. And lo and behold, the Coca-Cola Co.
has devised a diabolical scheme that says we're going to get you
again.''
</P>
<P>
   Essentially, Jones said, employees who felt they were
discriminated against by the company had been expecting some
redress through the suit. Now that potential redress is out the
window if they sign the waiver.
</P>
<P>
   The suit, filed by eight current and former employees, claims
that Coca-Cola has discriminated against African-Americans in pay,
promotions and performance evaluations.
</P>
<P>
   The company, which has denied the suit's allegations, says it is
only doing what is standard procedure for employers in these
situations.
</P>
<P>
   ``As always, the company's goal is to be fair and equitable to
all employees,'' said Coca-Cola spokesman Ben Deutsch. ``The
realignment process, along with the difficult decisions that go
along with it, is specifically designed to avoid the very thing
that the plaintiffs allege the company of doing _ discriminating
against its employees. For the waiver process to be fair and
equitable, it must be made available to everyone as a condition for
enhanced benefits.''
</P>
<P>
   Deutsch pointed out that laid-off employees will receive regular
severance benefits without signing a release form.
</P>
<P>
   Employment experts said it is common for companies to offer
enhanced severance benefits in exchange for eliminating future
legal problems through a release form.
</P>
<P>
   Deutsch added that the company has been using such release forms
for at least eight years.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, U.S. District Judge Richard Story ruled that the
company was within its legal rights after the plaintiffs' lawyers
challenged the release form.
</P>
<P>
   But the company's legal victory could turn into a significant
employee relations and public relations problem.
</P>
<P>
   That's partly because Jones, a 15-year company veteran who is
not a stranger to such issues, has become fully engaged in what he
views as a cause.
</P>
<P>
   Jones, 53, has been involved in other causes. In 1983 in
Virginia's Henrico County, Jones ran for supervisor to challenge an
all-white board. He lost, but his effort to win black
representation helped spur a federal suit that resulted in new
voting districts, including one creating a 60 percent black
majority.
</P>
<P>
   In 1990, Jones became a witness in an employment discrimination
suit against Circuit City. He had applied for a job with the
retailer, and during an interview he said a senior Circuit City
official made several negative comments about African-Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Jones is not a plaintiff in the suit against Coca-Cola. Neither
Jones nor plaintiffs' attorney Cyrus Mehri would comment on when
they initially came in contact with one another. But Jones said he
organized the Feb. 12 meeting at his church after scores of
confused employees asked for help in deciding what to do about the
release form.
</P>
<P>
   ``For some strange reason, people always come to me,'' Jones
said.
</P>
<P>
   Since the judge's ruling on the validity of the release form
advised employees to contact the plaintiffs' attorneys if they had
questions, Jones did just that. He asked plaintiffs' attorneys to
attend the meeting to field the questions he was getting from
colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   Two days after the meeting at St. Philip, where Jones is an
associate pastor, he said he spoke with Coca-Cola President Jack
Stahl. At that meeting, Jones said he told Stahl he would like the
company to change the release form to specifically exclude the
racial bias suit. That way, black employees wouldn't have to make
what was turning into a gut-wrenching decision.
</P>
<P>
   Jones said Stahl told him he would communicate Jones' concerns
to senior management and the company's general counsel. On the same
day, Jones said, he was told by a human resources director that he
had nothing to worry about when layoffs were announced the next
day.
</P>
<P>
   But that turned out to be false. Jones was laid off Feb. 15,
along with about 500 other employees. He claims it was in
retaliation for both the meeting he organized at his church and for
going to Stahl.
</P>
<P>
   The company, however, denies that Jones was laid off
inappropriately.
</P>
<P>
   ``Larry Jones' termination had absolutely nothing to do with the
meeting he held at the church or any actions he took thereafter,''
Deutsch said.
</P>
<P>
   The decision to lay off Jones was made Feb. 8 _ before either
the church meeting or Jones' meeting with Stahl, Deutsch said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The decisions made in the evaluation process prior to the
layoffs were based solely on the needs of the business and a fair
assessment of the skills and performance of each affected
employee,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of who is right on that issue, there's a bigger one.
Jones is now openly organizing employees to try to change the
company's position on the release form. Deutsch said if Coca-Cola
created a legal exclusion for the bias suit, it would be
discriminating against other employees who are being asked to give
up all their potential claims.
</P>
<P>
   With the failure of his meeting with Stahl, Jones said, he and
other employees will be ``pursuing other avenues,'' including a
``national strategy.'' He would not elaborate, but said options
would become clearer after the 3 p.m. meeting Saturday. At 5 p.m.
Saturday, Jones has called for a news conference in the front steps
of the church.
</P>
<P>
   The issue is probably not going to go away soon because the
company is in the middle of its cutback process, with more layoffs
to come. In North America the company has eliminated 1,600 jobs,
with another 1,700 to go.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever comes out of Saturday's meeting is likely to fuel
further employee gatherings in the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to have one every month,'' Jones said.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW PROVIDENCE, Bahamas _ The tourists who scuba dive among the
reefs and tan themselves on the sandy shores have probably seen
more of this island's coastline than Therell Bethell ever has. She
cannot remember the last time she visited a decent stretch of
beach, since the development boom over the last decade brought
gated communities and exclusive resorts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bahamians do not have access to the beach,'' said Bethel, a
legal secretary in Nassau. ``Bahamians have to have a puddle in our
backyards to swim.''
</P>
<P>
   The long-simmering resentment over the loss of their beaches has
crystallized in opposition to a proposed luxury community on the
longest remaining stretch of undeveloped coastline in New
Providence, the most populated island in the Bahamas.
</P>
<P>
   The development, Clifton Cay, would take up nearly two miles of
seaside land for 600 homes built around a marina and interspersed
with amenities like a golf course.
</P>
<P>
   The government of Prime Minister Hubert Ingraham supports the
development, in keeping with its policy of wooing newcomers who
bring money and jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents contend that their battle is not only over access to
the beach but also over access to their history. Their cause has
been taken up both by environmentalists, who fear damage to
delicate reefs, and by preservationists. The site is dotted with
the ruins of 18th-century plantations and slave quarters, as well
as the buried artifacts from two Lucayan Indian villages that date
back 1,000 years.
</P>
<P>
   International preservation and conservation groups have offered
support, saying this is a rare resource of natural beauty and
historical richness. [In February, Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., the
environmental lawyer and son of the late senator, contacted the
project's main backer, a Bechtel family trust, to urge that the
environmental impact be studied in more detail.)
</P>
<P>
   The developers, who plan to begin construction in the next two
or three months, say they will protect the ruins and not harm the
environment. Opponents are skeptical.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest problem in the Bahamas today is that our
government does not understand that money is not everything,'' said
Keod Smith, a Nassau lawyer. ``They feel if they show economic
activity, capital injection and tax revenues increase, when you
look at the books, it looks great. But do we sell our heritage just
because we want some money?''
</P>
<P>
   It is easy to see the site's appeal: turtles and dolphins glide
through the water, and conch shells, iridescently pink, are
scattered on the sandy shore. Thick, inland brush offers protection
from winds and floods, and nearby wetlands are filled each winter
with flocks of migrating kestrels, ospreys and warblers.
</P>
<P>
   Treasures are tucked among the trees or buried under the sand. A
few years ago, Laurie Wilkie, an archaeologist from the University
of California at Berkeley, began to study the remains of an
18th-century plantation owned by William Wylly, who was known for
trying to improve conditions for and extend rights to slaves.
Wilkie found bits of ceramic, tobacco pipes and bottles at one part
of the site. At another spot, she examined the ruins of slave
quarters and a kitchen.
</P>
<P>
   Her most remarkable find came in the late 1990s after
preservationists expressed alarm that the proposed development
might destroy remains of a Lucayan Indian village, and the
government asked her to research its boundaries.
</P>
<P>
   She said that her findings led her to conclude that a
development should not be built there. Between the information
about early Indian inhabitants and 18th century plantation life,
the site is a veritable Rosetta Stone for understanding life on the
island.
</P>
<P>
   ``This represents one of those rare arenas where you can study
the whole extent of the human experience in a location, starting
with the Lucayan villages,'' she said. ``I can't think of another
site that contains all this.''
</P>
<P>
   She said the findings are especially valuable because the
government kept good records about slavery during the plantation
period. ``This is so rare,'' she said. ``To look at African history
and talking about individuals, and tie that to archaeological
remains is very unusual. We are not talking about nameless,
faceless people, but individuals who have a very real identity and
experience of slavery.''
</P>
<P>
   The descendant of one of those slaves has become one of the most
outspoken opponents of the development. Vivian Whylly, a
38-year-old Nassau businessman, said he had traced his roots to
Esther Whylly, his great-great-great-grandmother, who was a slave
on the Wylly plantation and like many slaves, took the owner's last
name. He filed a claim on the land; it has been unsuccessful so
far, but he plans to appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Whylly would like to see the land become a national park, where
people could go to learn about the island's earliest settlers.
Preservationists have started a fund to purchase the land,
obtaining commitments of nearly $4 million.
</P>
<P>
   Whylly said he often visits the area, to soak up the spirits
that he feels still dwell among the ruins. ``It keeps their spirit
alive to know that this is where the people who would be my
foreparents lived,'' he said. ``Their spirit says don't let us
become enslaved again.''
</P>
<P>
   The project's developers, Chaffin Light &AMP; Associates, said they
were willing to protect the ruins and would create a fund financed
by home and property sales to create a learning center accessible
to the public. They said they were working with the government to
ensure that no environmental harm would come from the construction.
They acknowledged that previous environmental impact statements
were insufficient.
</P>
<P>
   The developers have also set aside a 500-foot stretch of beach
for the public, but they contend that the issue of shoreline access
should be reviewed in a broader context.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an issue we respect,'' said Jim Anthony, president of
the Clifton Cay Co. Ltd. ``But the debate is larger than Clifton
Cay.''
</P>
<P>
   The debate goes even deeper than the vanishing public shoreline
and is touching off passions about the island's identity and its
future. Independent only since 1973, the Bahamas has had much new
foreign development in recent years, thanks to Ingraham's
initiative. Developments like Clifton Cay, officials say, create
jobs _ a priority for the current government.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is what our people needed for a better way of life and
education,'' Said Earl Deveaux, the top environmental adviser to
the prime minister. ``What country is concerned about preserving
artifacts when it is scraping by for a living or for food?''
</P>
<P>
   But Sam Duncombe, an advocate here for environmental
preservation, said the developments cater too much to outsiders
without regard to the needs of Bahamians who want to see the
shoreline preserved for future generations.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a certain ilk of American who believes the world is
their oyster,'' Duncombe said. ``We resent it. To them it's money.
To us it's who we are. It's our peace of mind. It's our soul.''
</P>
<P>
   To allow the project to continue, she said, would revive one
tradition _ that of the pirates that used to hide in the inlets not
far from where the homes are planned.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea of pirates still exists,'' she said. ``They no longer
have beards and long coats.'' She said she sees some government
officials as modern-day pirates. ``They are selling us out,'' she
said. ``We need foreign development. But at what price?''

McCAIN TARGETS FALWELL, ROBERTSON IN ATTACKS 
 
By GREG McDONALD 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   VIRGINIA BEACH, Va. _ John McCain denounced two of the Christian
right's icons in their own home state Monday, calling them ``agents
of intolerance'' to whom Republican politicians pander to the
detriment of GOP traditions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are the party of Ronald Reagan,'' McCain said, ``not Pat
Robertson.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Jerry Falwell also was in the Arizona senator's sights
at a high school in the Atlantic coast town, where Robertson's
televangelical empire and the Christian Coalition are based.
Falwell's evangelical church and political arm are based in
Lynchburg in the western part of the state.
</P>
<P>
   Virginia holds its Republican primary Tuesday along with North
Dakota and Washington state. Washington also has a nonbinding
Democratic contest.
</P>
<P>
   Bush dismissed McCain's attempts to cloak himself in the mantle
of former President Reagan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ronald Reagan didn't point fingers. He never played to
people's religious fears, as Senator McCain has shamelessly done,''
Bush said in Bellevue, Wash. ``He's playing the religion card.
That's not Reaganesque. It reminds me of the current
administration.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain's speech could prove to be a defining moment in his
effort to broaden the party's appeal to the Democrats and
independents who have largely given him his front-runner status.
McCain narrowly leads Bush in delegates, 96-93, following Bush's
sweep of U.S. territories during weekend primaries.
</P>
<P>
   Loyal Republicans, particularly those who consider themselves in
the religious right, have voted steadily for Bush.
</P>
<P>
   McCain took pains to aim his attack not at conservative
Christian voters but at ``a few of their self-appointed leaders.''
To that end, he was accompanied by former rival Gary Bauer, a
social conservative leader.
</P>
<P>
   ``Neither party should be defined by pandering to the outer
reaches of American politics and the agents of intolerance, whether
they be Louis Farrakhan or Al Sharpton on the left or Pat Robertson
and Jerry Falwell on the right,'' McCain said.
</P>
<P>
   He also criticized Robertson and other Bush supporters, as well
as the governor himself, for misrepresenting his views on
campaign-finance reform, abortion and other issues, charging that
the distortions of his record had led party members to label him
``disloyal.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain also offered no apologies for his appeal to Democrats and
independents.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe it is the height of foolishness to build a wall
around our party in fear that we are so narrowly defined that new
faces and fresh ideas in accord with our basic principles will
jeopardize our values,'' McCain told a cheering crowd in the packed
gymnasium of the Franklin Cox High School.
</P>
<P>
   ``America is more than the sum of its divided parts, and so our
party should be.''
</P>
<P>
   But McCain also used his speech to condemn ``union bosses'' with
close ties to the Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   Describing them as ``mirror images of Pat Robertson,'' he
accused them of subordinating ``the interests of working families
to their own ambitions'' and ``their desire to preserve their own
political power at all costs.''
</P>
<P>
   ``My friends, we are building a new Republican majority, a
majority to serve the values that have long defined our party and
made our country great. Social conservatives should flock to our
banner,'' the senator said.
</P>
<P>
   McCain went on to boast that he is the only ``Reagan
Republican'' in the race for the GOP nomination capable of
defeating presumed Democratic nominee Al Gore in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, Governor Bush is a Pat Robertson Republican who
will lose to Al Gore,'' McCain said, charging that his major
opponent had allied himself with those who practice the ``political
tactics of division and slander.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush took offense at such remarks, saying, ``There's no room in
our process, shouldn't be, for people who ascribe beliefs to me
which I don't believe and I don't share.''
</P>
<P>
   Virginia Sen. John Warner, a former Navy secretary, criticized
the speech by the former Navy pilot: ``I have to tell my old friend
to pull back on his throttle and quit trying to fire heat-seeking
missiles up everybody's tailpipe.''
</P>
<P>
   The attack on Robertson and Falwell came after a telephone
campaign they ran in South Carolina and Virginia that painted
McCain as a pro-abortion rights candidate and referred to his
co-chairman, former Sen. Warren Rudman, as a ``vicious''
anti-Christian bigot.
</P>
<P>
   Kara Kennedy, chief of staff to Bush's Washington state
chairman, U.S. Rep. Jennifer Dunn, said recorded calls are being
made all over the state alleging that Bush has stayed silent on his
visit to Bob Jones University, whose leader has made anti-Catholic
statements. Similar calls were made in Michigan before its primary.
</P>
<P>
   McCain is trailing Bush in Virginia, and some of his aides are
concerned that his harsh attack on the state's leading Christian
leaders will hurt his chances even more.
</P>
<P>
   As for his chances in Virginia, McCain said, ``I'm not worried
at all because I think the majority of Virginians will reject the
politics practiced by Pat Robertson.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain campaign officials did not choose the venue by accident.
By wading into the heartland of GOP Christian supporters, McCain
sought to contrast the visit by Bush earlier this month to Bob
Jones University in South Carolina, where Bush gave his standard
stump speech to a school that bans interracial dating and whose
founder has made virulently anti-Catholic statements.
</P>
<P>
   Under heavy criticism, Bush on Sunday apologized to Catholic
leaders for not repudiating the school's attitudes.

MCCAIN SCORES EVANGELICALS' `INTOLERANCE' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By YVONNE ABRAHAM AND JILL ZUCKMAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   VIRGINIA BEACH, Va. _ Senator John McCain issued a stinging
condemnation of Christian conservative Pat Robertson Monday and
other prominent evangelical ``agents of intolerance.''
</P>
<P>
   Delivering his address in Robertson's hometown where his
Christian Coalition is based, McCain said Robertson and fellow
Christian conservative Jerry Falwell ``distort my pro-life
positions and smear the reputations of my supporters. Why?'' he
asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because I don't pander to them, because I don't ascribe to
their failed philosophy that money is our message.'' McCain said.
``The union bosses who have subordinated the interests of working
families to their own ambitions, to their desire to preserve their
own political power at all costs, are mirror images of Pat
Robertson.''
</P>
<P>
   Texas Governor George W. Bush, campaigning in Bellevue, Wash.,
responded with a shake of his head when told about the speech. ``It
sounds like Senator McCain has taken to needless name-calling,''
Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ronald Reagan never played to people's religious fears like
Senator McCain has shamelessly done,'' he said, calling his
opponent ``a man who wants to point fingers.''
</P>
<P>
   Robertson's political organization, the Christian Coalition,
issued a statement calling McCain's comments ``a transparent effort
to divide one American from another on the basis of religion.''
</P>
<P>
   Though Robertson was the primary target of McCain's address,
delivered the day before GOP contests in Virginia, Washington state
and North Dakota, Bush was also in his sights. Robertson has
appeared on national television calling McCain dangerous to the
future of the Republican Party. And Robertson made phone calls to
voters in both South Carolina and Michigan supporting Bush and
criticizing McCain, and calling former US Senator Warren Rudman of
New Hampshire, McCain's national campaign chairman, a ``vicious
bigot.''
</P>
<P>
   Robertson, McCain argued, was so intolerant of the independent
and Democratic voters flocking to McCain's candidacy that he would
``build a wall around our party.''
</P>
<P>
   ``My friends,'' said McCain near the end of his speech. ``I am a
Reagan Republican who will defeat Al Gore. Unfortunately, Governor
Bush is a Pat Robertson Republican who will lose to Al Gore.''
</P>
<P>
   He also said, ``Neither party should be defined by pandering to
the outer reaches of American politics and agents of intolerance,
whether they be Louis Farrakhan or Al Sharpton on the left, or Pat
Robertson and Jerry Falwell on the right.'' McCain stressed that he
was not attacking all Christian conservatives, but was criticizing
some leaders like Robertson and Falwell. The senator ended his
speech by drawing a clear battle line, and he received a standing
ovation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are the party of Theodore Roosevelt not the party of
special interests,'' he said. ``We are the party of Abraham Lincoln
not Bob Jones... Join us and welcome anyone of good faith to our
ranks. ''
</P>
<P>
   The mention of Bob Jones referred to Bush's February speech at
Bob Jones University in South Carolina, in which the governor
failed to comment on the school's policy against interracial
dating, or on the anti-Catholic views of Jones, its president.
</P>
<P>
   Bush issued a written apology for that omission over the
weekend, after the McCain campaign used the appearance to recast
Bush's strong South Carolina victory as proof of his catering to
the right wign.
</P>
<P>
   But McCain and his aides said they would continue to use Bush's
appearance at the university against him, as they did in phone
calls to Catholic voters in Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   At a briefing after his speech, McCain said the calls are
``completely factual. I don't see why people should confine their
campaign tactics to one state and then not be held responsible for
that campaign tactic throughout the rest of the nation.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush, after meeting with voters at the community college in
Bellevue, Wash., said McCain is doing one thing and saying another,
although he refused to accuse McCain of lying. ``It reminds me of
the current administration,'' said Bush, who had responded angrily
when McCain had compared him in a commercial to President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a political game Senator McCain is trying to play by
pitting one group against another,'' Bush said. ``The people are
beginning to condemn the kind of politics that Mr. McCain is
engaged in.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush called McCain ``a person who obviously wants to divide
people into camps. He invokes the name of Ronald Reagan and yet at
the same time plays upon people's fears and that's not the politics
of the Ronald Reagan I remember.''
</P>
<P>
   Jennifer Dunn, the Washington congresswoman who is backing Bush,
said she believes McCain made a serious mistake by denying his
campaign had made telephone calls in Michigan about Bush's visit to
Bob Jones University and the school's anti-Catholic views.
</P>
<P>
   ``People in our state don't like that type of politics,'' Dunn
said. ``It's an integrity issue. People are beginning to question
John McCain's integrity.''
</P>
<P>
   While McCain kept his sites trained on Bush Monday, Bush
generally ignored his opponent for the Republican nomination or
referred to him obliquely.
</P>
<P>
   When asked about encouraging young people to get involved in
politics, Bush took a shot.
</P>
<P>
   ``Young people know the difference between somebody who says one
thing and does another, between somebody who says he's going to run
one kind of campaign and does another,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Then, when asked about campaign finance reform, Bush took
another swipe at McCain, saying he did not believe candidates
should roll money over from a race for one office to a race for
another.
</P>
<P>
   ``If somebody's going to talk the talk, they need to walk the
walk, too,'' said Bush, without mentioning that McCain has used
money for his Senate races in his presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Coming out so forcefully against Robertson, and in largely
conservative Virginia the day before its Republican primary, is a
risky strategy for McCain. He said his speech was an appeal to
Christian conservatives, not a challenge to them.
</P>
<P>
   He said his speech was not about Bush but about ``the future of
the Republican Party.'' While hammering his credentials as ``a
proud Reagan conservative,'' McCain called on conservatives to
reject the intolerance of leaders like Robertson in favor of a more
open philosophy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The majority of the citizens of the state of Virginia reject
the kind of politics practiced by Pat Robertson,'' McCain said.
``Where he makes phone calls with his own voice saying that Warren
Rudman, who served in Korea and served as attorney general and
served in the US Senate, calling him `a vicious bigot.' I am sure
the majority of the citizens of Virginia will reject the practice
of such politics.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain's speech also emphasized his credibility as a
conservative and his wish to appeal to all kinds of voters. For
more liberal voters, he took a stand against Robertson, Falwell and
Bob Jones University. For conservatives, he underlined his
commitment to lower taxes and his defense ``of the sanctity of life
and the values that make families strong and our country great.''
And he spoke of his own religious faith as one that ``unites and
never divides,'' echoing a phrase often used by Bush.
</P>
<P>
   There is a chance McCain has underestimated the strength of
support for Robertson and Falwell in Virginia, and his strategy
might backfire in Tuesday primary, which Bush is favored to win.
</P>
<P>
   But aides hoped voters would see that McCain had the courage to
do in Virginia what Bush did not do at Bob Jones University.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's possible'' McCain will alienate some voters,''
said spokesman Howard Opinsky. ``But again, the contrast that we
draw with George Bush is, we can go to a place where we disagree
with people and express to them directly why we disagree with them.
Governor Bush went to Bob Jones University and never said a word
about how he disagreed with them ... John McCain is not afraid to
speak his mind and to reach out for conservative voters even here
in Pat Robertson's backyard.''

COMMENTARY: WINLESS IN SEATTLE 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By GAIL COLLINS    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ It would be nice if Bill Bradley could win the
Washington primary Tuesday. He deserves one really good night from
this campaign. Even Steve Forbes had his presidential moment, for
heaven's sake, when he came in first in the Arizona primary four
years ago. (The Forbes campaign tended to describe that victory,
which involved 34 percent of the vote, in terms normally reserved
for the winning of World War II, or at least the invention of
penicillin.)
</P>
<P>
   The Bradley campaign, although dogged and determined, is getting
to be like Jim Bowie at the Alamo, down to its last round of
ammunition and exhibiting an ominous cough. So a week ago Bradley
made a tactical retreat to the state of Washington, hoping that if
he does better than expected here, the momentum might propel him
back into the voting public's line of vision.
</P>
<P>
   Since the Washington Democratic primary is actually just a
pretend election that's supposed to ``advise'' the party caucuses
in March, the state is used to being ignored. But last week it was
positively crawling with candidates searching for the Big Mo, all
waving brand-new position papers about pipeline safety and
ferryboat subsidies. Al Gore arrived bearing a new TV commercial,
which depicts his recent climb up Mount Rainier in terms usually
reserved for the conquest of Mount Everest, or at least the Steve
Forbes primary victory in Arizona. John McCain bowed to the state's
fierce interest in nature by redefining himself as a ``conservative
conservationist,'' which seems to be a compassionate conservative
who recycles.
</P>
<P>
   ``State's primary suddenly a big deal,'' announced Seattle's
Sunday paper in a banner headline. Everybody has taken sides on the
controversy over whether some of Washington's dams should be
breached to give the endangered salmon a clear path to their
spawning grounds. I will summarize their positions:
</P>
<P>
   McCain: I'm keeping an open mind. What would Teddy Roosevelt
have done? Beware the Death Star, Luke.
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush: Save the dams. Let the salmon walk. Usher in the
era of responsibility. Got a great wife. Love my kids. Klaatu,
barada nikto.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley: As a U.S. senator, I freed salmon in other states.
</P>
<P>
   Gore: Did I show you the pictures of me at the top of Mount
Rainier?
</P>
<P>
   Bradley has drawn some good crowds here, but the campaign has to
be driving him nuts. His themes are the classic priorities for
women voters _ health care, the environment and gun control _ but
he's suffering a serious gender gap in the polls. There's never
been a white candidate for president more focused on racial
healing, yet the black vote is going to Al Gore. While Bradley has
been busy denouncing Gore as a closet conservative and trying to
herd his natural constituents back, the rest of the flock has
broken to the right and run off to follow John McCain.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I were Bradley, I'd be tearing my hair out,'' agreed Jim
McDermott, a Seattle congressman who is Bradley's star local
supporter. Generally buoyant, McDermott has developed a tendency to
note in rather mournful tones that Bradley is ``a very serious guy
who'd make a great president'' and then begin reminiscing about
Walter Mondale.
</P>
<P>
   It is unarguably crazy that voters who believe in things like
gun control and universal health coverage and abortion rights would
rally around McCain, who doesn't. ``He doesn't even  &UR; have &LR;  a health
care policy,'' Bradley said rather plaintively. On the other hand,
the McCain campaign offers the promise that fighting for reform can
be exciting and fun, while Bradley gives it the aura of a slightly
depressing duty, like tooth-flossing.
</P>
<P>
   ``He seemed wicked smart, but he's not, like, a wow,'' one
student told his friend as they staggered away from a Bradley
speech on economics at Columbia University last week.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley is the ant who planned his campaign meticulously, while
McCain is the grasshopper whose staff didn't check until last week
to see what primaries come after March 14. It is an excellent
example, people, in how life is unfair. Or maybe this is just Fate,
evening the cosmic score. Remember Princeton, Bill? The Rhodes
scholarship? The Olympic medal? The Knicks championship? The
Senate? It's payback time.

 &HT;    Upcoming Georgia primary draws little interest from lawmakers
 &HT;    By Tom Baxter
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ At Georgia's Capitol _ like much of the state _ you
would hardly know there's going to be a presidential primary next
week.
</P>
<P>
   With most of the Golden Dome's politicos long since committed to
one front-runner or the other, the presidential contest is a matter
of distant interest as the session rolls on.
</P>
<P>
   ``I kind of fell into the Bush camp, and sit there quietly,''
Sen. Tom Price, a former Elizabeth Dole supporter said. He might
not be the only Republican legislator in a similar posture.
</P>
<P>
   McCain fever may be spreading elsewhere in Georgia, but Rep.
Clint Smith of Dawsonville was a lonely figure sporting a McCain
pin in the House on Monday. Despite being vastly outgunned by the
forces of Gov. George W. Bush, Smith was undaunted.
</P>
<P>
   He planned to speak for McCain the morning of March 7 at the
Senate GOP caucus. So far, Charles Tanksley, the governor's
Republican floor leader, is the only senator supporting McCain, but
Smith was confident that with enough time, more Republican
legislators would come around.
</P>
<P>
   The problem, he acknowledged, is that the primary's only a week
away.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had citizens calling the McCain headquarters and wanting
to get active,'' Smith said. ``I think it'll be an interesting
week.''
</P>
<P>
   On the Democratic side, just about all the interest in next
Tuesday's primary can be summed up in a single question: Why is
Terry Coleman supporting Bill Bradley?
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got a buck-the-trend attitude,'' the House Appropriations
chairman said, explaining his decision to buck Vice President Al
Gore, the choice of Gov. Roy Barnes, Speaker Tom Murphy and the
rest of the Democratic leadership.
</P>
<P>
   Coleman and Rep. Tyrone Brooks, who don't often vote in the
minority together in the House, are on Bradley's Georgia steering
committee. That list may not be long on legislators but it's chock
full of names from other circles: the King scholar David Garrow,
Alliance Theater director Kenny Leon, Atlanta City Councilman C.T.
Martin, R.E.M. attorney Bertis Downs and Atlanta Newspapers
Chairman Anne Cox Chambers, among others.
</P>
<P>
   Coleman remained cordial in his opposition, saying Bradley has
served a useful role as a ``sparring partner'' for Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ``The governor was giving me the devil about it the other day,
and I told him if he didn't have Bradley in the race, the vice
president would have been very overconfident, and he'd still be way
behind (Bush) in the polls,'' Coleman said.
</P>
<P>
   A dull, predictable Gore victory next week would be to Rep.
Calvin Smyre's liking, but even the vice-president's state chairman
acknowledged wistfully that it would have been nice if Georgia
weren't voting in a traffic jam next week, to ``define it more and
give it some thump.''
</P>
<P>
   How to put more ``thump'' into the front-loaded nomination
process was the subject of the Democratic National Committee
regional hearing Saturday. For this year, if there's going to be
any thump, it will have to come from the voters' own initiative.

SUNSET LIMITED SHUFFLE LEAVES SAN ANTONIO OUT 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By PHILIP CAUTHON 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Amtrak plans later this year to scrap passenger
train service connecting Houston, San Antonio and El Paso, instead
rerouting the Sunset Limited Line north from Houston through Dallas
and Fort Worth, officials said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The decision is part of nationwide expansion of rail service
that will make Fort Worth a major hub in the nation's financially
shaky passenger rail system.
</P>
<P>
   Amtrak officials also announced plans to begin daily passenger
service between San Antonio and Monterrey, Mexico, and providing
daily departures on the Texas Eagle connecting San Antonio and
Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Amtrak President George Warrington said San Antonio would be
eliminated as a stop on the east-west Sunset Limited as soon as
fall. The line _ which connects Orlando, Fla. and Los Angeles _
will be rerouted north from Houston to serve more populous markets
in North Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Making a difference in Amtrak is about making money,''
Warrington said, addressing the substantial loss of service to West
Texas and other rural areas. ``Sometimes you have to make some
difficult calls.''
</P>
<P>
   Warrington said that the Sunset Limited's doomed southern route
serves only about 30,000 customers a year. He predicted the
northern route will generate increased ridership.
</P>
<P>
   Helping boost that ridership would be plans to extend passenger
service from Meridian, Miss., through Shreveport, La., and Dallas
to Fort Worth, he said. Meridian is a stop on Amtrak's Southern
Crescent line between New York and New Orleans.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, R-Texas and chairwoman of the Senate
Surface Transportation subcommittee, said, ``I would like to see us
keep the Houston-San Antonio line as the southern route but not in
lieu of the route that would go north into Dallas-Fort Worth.''

JURY DELIBERATIONS TO BEGIN IN GORE FUND-RAISER'S CASE  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: R.I., Calif.)   By NEIL A. LEWIS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ After listening to testimony for nearly three
weeks, a federal jury will begin deliberating Tuesday over the fate
of Maria Hsia, a longtime fund-raiser for Vice President Al Gore
who is charged with operating a scheme to disguise campaign
donations to Gore and the Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   Both the prosecution and Hsia's defense completed their final
arguments to the jury Monday. Hsia and her lawyers did not put on
any witnesses of their own, relying solely on cross-examinations of
the government's witnesses to make their case that she is not
guilty of the five felony counts she faces.
</P>
<P>
   According to the indictment, Hsia was at the center of an
operation in which she persuaded fellow Asian-Americans to make out
checks to either the Clinton-Gore campaign, the Democratic National
Committee or the re-election effort of Rep. Patrick J. Kennedy, a
Rhode Island Democrat. The government said that those people who
wrote the checks were then reimbursed by people who were the real
donors and who could not legally contribute for a variety of
reasons.
</P>
<P>
   Nancy Luque, Hsia's lawyer, told the jury that her client
``never told anyone to break the law or give donations in the name
of another person.''
</P>
<P>
   Luque sought to narrow the case before the jury to the five
counts, which do not specifically charge Hsia with the scheme of
finding false donors. The indictment charges that Hsia caused other
people to file false reports with the Federal Election Commission.
Luque argued that Hsia never even spoke with any of the campaign
treasurers who filed the reports.
</P>
<P>
   John McEnany, a prosecutor with the Justice Department's special
task force that is investigating fund-raising irregularities during
the 1996 election, said that the evidence showed that Hsia was
aware of the system of arranging for ``conduits'' or straw donors
to conceal the real contributors and stood silent as false reports
were filed with the election commission.
</P>
<P>
   It was Hsia, in the prosecution's view of the case, who arranged
for the April, 1996, visit of Gore to the Hsi Lai Temple, a
Buddhist place of worship in Hacienda Heights, Calif. Gore's visit
to the temple and the resulting political donations he reaped from
it have proved a deep embarrassment for him and a political
opportunity for his opponents.
</P>
<P>
   The event raised more than $100,000 and Hsia is charged with
funneling $55,000 from the temple itself through false donors
including several monks and nuns at the temple. As a tax-exempt
religious institution, the temple is prohibited from making
political donations.
</P>
<P>
   Gore initially asserted that the temple visit during the
campaign was not a fund-raising event but rather ``community
outreach.'' He later acknowledged he knew it was
``finance-related.''
</P>
<P>
   A videotape of Gore's appearance at the temple was introduced as
evidence and the Republican majority on the House Government Reform
and Oversight Committee has sought to obtain a copy of it. Judge
Paul Friedman, who is presiding at the trial, agreed to a request
from Luque that the Gore videotape not be released until the end of
the trial lest it be used in political advertisements which might
be seen on television by the jury.
</P>
<P>
   At the heart of the government's case is the notion that Gore as
well as a succession of Democratic Party fund-raisers were duped by
Hsia, who was really the mastermind of the scheme. The prosecution
presented evidence that at the end of Gore's appearance at the
Buddhist temple, Hsia was told by John Huang, a party fund-raiser,
that there was disappointment that the revenue from the event was
less than $50,000. Huang told Hsia, according to testimony, that
there was an expectation the event would net at least $100,000.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, Hsia handed Huang an envelope with checks totaling
$100,000, many of them written by nuns and monks of the temple.
Those people were later reimbursed and the government argued that
Hsia was surely aware of what happened and allowed others to file
false reports as to the source of the donations.
</P>
<P>
   But Luque offered a starkly different portrait of the event and
Hsia's role in it. She said that Gore's visit was, in fact, to make
political contact with Asian-Americans and the videotape shows he
did not say any of the things typically associated with a
fund-raising visit, like thanking people for their support.
</P>
<P>
   As to the envelope that was handed the next day to Huang with
$100,000 in checks, Luque said that it was sealed and the
prosecution presented no evidence that Hsia knew what was in it.
``She never saw those checks, she never knew how they were
solicited and she didn't know that anybody was reimbursed.''

RECORD RETAILERS SEE DOOMSDAY IN DOWNLOADED MUSIC  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Minn., Texas)   By MATT RICHTEL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The advent of e-commerce and the prospect that consumers will
buy music by downloading it directly from the Internet has strained
the traditionally congenial relations between record labels and
record stores and set off a power struggle between them.
</P>
<P>
   The reason is that for all the newfound efficiencies imagined by
a world in which consumers download music from the comfort of home,
it is a doomsday scenario for record retailers, whose livelihood
depends on consumers leaving home to buy their music in a store.
</P>
<P>
   There is little concern that downloading music will become a
major factor in the market for recorded music within the next two
years. Still, the record stores say the labels owe much of their
success to the marketing expertise and customer-relations skills of
the retailers, and as a group they have vowed to fight aggressively
to preserve their place in the sales chain.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the record companies want to start marginalizing the
retailers, then retailers will start looking to become labels
themselves and signing up bands themselves,'' said Pamela Horovitz,
president of the National Association of Recording Merchants, or
NARM.
</P>
<P>
   That is not a threat many take seriously, although Best Buy, one
of the nation's largest music retailers, has already purchased its
own record label. Even so, it suggests the depth of the feelings at
NARM's annual convention, taking place this week in San Antonio.
Participants say the emergence of online commerce is the dominant,
if not the single, topic of conversation. The mood, they say, is a
mix of some optimism about the prospects for online sales and a
sense of urgency that the record stores are quickly losing ground
in the e-commerce world.
</P>
<P>
   The record labels have the brakes on digital downloads at least
until the middle of the year while they wait for technology that
will protect their copyrighted material from being easily pirated
online. But a more immediate concern is growing competition from
e-retailers like Amazon.com and CDNow and from the labels
themselves, which are increasingly selling compact discs online for

   For example, the Web sites of Trans World Entertainment, one of
the nation's largest record store chains whose properties include
Record Town and Coconuts, logged a mere $246,000 in online sales
during the Christmas quarter, said Gary Balter, a music retail
analyst with DLJ, the New York-based brokerage house. By
comparison, Amazon.com racked up $96 million in music sales during
its fourth quarter, Balter said, illustrating that retailers ``need
to have a more coherent Internet strategy.''
</P>
<P>
   Music Land Group, a chain of 1,350 stores in the U.S. with
headquarters in Minneapolis, launched its commercial Web sites for
chains like Sam Goody and Sun Coast at the end of June. Best Buy
has been selling music online since 1997, but it was a bare bones
effort until last summer, when the company named a president of its
online business. It plans to re-launch its site in May.
</P>
<P>
   The stakes will be much higher when consumers can download music
digitally. The record labels, at least in theory, will be able to
sell music directly to consumers, bypassing the retail stores that
have long been the labels' interface with the public.
</P>
<P>
   The record companies say they have no intention of bypassing the
record stores, and, in fact, there are scenarios under which the
stores could thrive in the digital music market. For example,
in-store kiosks could offer customers music downloaded and recorded
on a CD or loaded directly into the flash memory of a digital music
player. Such technologies would reduce stores' inventories while
enabling them to offer greater selection.
</P>
<P>
   Generally, Gilbert L. Wachsman, vice chairman of Musicland, said
that e-commerce had already taken a toll on his company _ not in
sales, which have been growing, but in the perception of investors.
</P>
<P>
   Musicland's annual earnings rose from 40 cents a share in 1997
to $1.60 a share last year. But the company's stock price fell 45
percent last year and has fallen 17 percent this year, said Balter,
who noted that Trans World's stock also fell 45 percent in 1999,
also despite strong sales.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe that the stock market is discounting the future of
companies like ours because there is a belief of the threat of
disintermediation,'' said Wachsman. ``Disintermediation'' is the
removal of middlemen.
</P>
<P>
   Officials from the record retailing industry say they bring a
great deal of value to the market by creating a physical conduit
between the recording industry and consumers and by applying
expertise in merchandizing, inventory and marketing. ``A lot of
companies think that throwing a button on a Web site makes you a
retailer,'' Horovitz said.
</P>
<P>
   But despite these nods to optimism, the record stores aren't
taking any chances. On the last day of January, NARM sued Sony
Music Entertainment accusing the label of using the Internet to
compete unfairly against the record stores.
</P>
<P>
   The suit alleges that in some of its compact discs, Sony is
including a link to its Web site where consumers can buy music.
Thus, the merchants say, when they sell a Sony disc they are
effectively selling a marketing tool for the online retail
component of Sony, a competitor.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be like if WalMart had to put up a sign referring
people to Target,'' Wachsman said.
</P>
<P>
   In light of the lawsuit, Sony has boycotted the convention.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, Sony said NARM has ``singled out Sony Music on
which to project fears and misgivings about the Internet's role in
the future of the music business.''
</P>
<P>
   NARM officials don't entirely dispute that assessment. Horovitz
said the suit was ``looking down the line.''
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, she said, there is a growing dispute over who will own
the customer information when a digital download does take place.
For instance, if a consumer downloads a song from a retailer's
site, Horovitz said, the retailers are concerned that the labels
will want the information for their own databases, enabling the
labels to market directly to the retailer's customer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have concerns they won't be able to resist using it for
marketing,'' she said. ``This is exploding into a huge issue.''

CLINTON TO BLOCK EUROPE'S CHOICE TO LEAD IMF 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By JOSEPH KAHN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton has vowed to block the man Europe
wants to head the International Monetary Fund, setting off a
possibly protracted contest for control of the financial
institution and putting the United States in the role of kingmaker.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's rejection of Caio Koch-Weser, a German Finance
Ministry official, makes the succession at the IMF the biggest
battle for leadership of a major international institution since
the United States fought to oust U.N. Secretary-General Boutros
Boutros-Ghali and replace him with Kofi Annan in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration says that in an era when financial
crises can spread at Internet speed from country to country, the
German candidate does not have what it takes to be the world's
chief financial firefighter.
</P>
<P>
   The decision, relayed by Clinton in a phone call to German
Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder on Saturday and made public Monday,
challenges the automatic European prerogative to choose the leader
of the IMF, a tradition that began when the fund was created just
after World War II.
</P>
<P>
   But the Clinton administration has so far declined to rub it in
by backing the sole American contender for the job, leaving open
the possibility that Europe could still hold onto the position by
putting forth another candidate of greater stature to succeed
Michel Camdessus as managing director of the fund.
</P>
<P>
   The American, Stanley Fischer, the No. 2 official at the fund,
was nominated by an unusual coalition of African and Arab countries
and has demonstrated the skill to head the fund, backers say. But
the Clinton administration seems likely to withhold support for
him, at least initially, fearing that Europe might cripple the fund
rather than see leadership pass to an American.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Europe is standing by Koch-Weser, who has benefited from
an aggressive German lobbying campaign over the last three months.
Though Clinton told Schroeder of firm U.S opposition on Saturday,
European finance ministers, meeting in Brussels, Belgium, on
Monday, announced formal backing for Koch-Weser, with some
ministers indicating that American pressure helped them rally
around the European choice.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The dance over IMF succession shows how complex it is to select
leaders of world institutions at a time when globalization is
racing ahead _ and when resistance to the spread of American-style
capitalism and Western ideas appears to be mounting in tandem.
</P>
<P>
   Since the monetary fund intervened in many of the largest
developing countries in the late 1990s to help them grapple with
the spread of financial panic that began in Asia, its power to
influence how nations manage their economies and their currencies
is by some measures at an all-time high.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the process of selecting a leader for the fund is stuck in a
half-century-old global mind-set, when Europe and the United States
controlled nearly every important international position and, in
the case of the IMF and the World Bank, simply divided the posts
between them like members of a gentleman's club.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration's rejection of Koch-Weser and its
decision not to throw support behind Fischer _ a combination one
observer called a ``half-pregnant'' assertion of American power _
shook that tradition but did not shatter it.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The United States has signaled that it wants Europe to select
someone more senior and experienced than Koch-Weser, but has made
it clear to European officials that it does not intend to deny them
the right to choose.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``On the one hand America is saying that we should find a better
candidate,'' says C. Fred Bergsten, who heads the Institute of
International Economics and has studied ways of reforming the IMF.
``On the other hand, we are passing up a golden opportunity to end
this anachronism and really open up the process.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The American position leaves the selection process in limbo,
raising the prospect that none of the three candidates nominated
for the job will ultimately get it. The Japanese have nominated
Eisuke Sakakibara, a former high-level Finance Ministry official
known by the nickname ``Mr. Yen.''
</P>
<P>
   IMF board members may begin informal voting later this week,
taking a straw poll to determine whether any of the candidates has
strong support. It is still possible that one of the candidates
could gather enough support to force a formal vote. Supporters of
Fischer and Koch-Weser are working to line up support from
developing countries and to generate momentum.
</P>
<P>
   Voting power at the IMF is determined primarily by the amount of
money donor nations contribute. The United States has a 19 percent
share, more than any other single nation. The European Union has 37
percent of the votes if the 15 nations that make up that block vote
together. In practice, member nations have tended to favor those
who command considerably more than a simple majority of the votes.
</P>
<P>
   Koch-Weser, a 25-year veteran of the World Bank and an expert in
development policies, still vows to win the post. With Europe's
firm backing now in hand, he said he intended to recruit support
from developing countries. He counts China and Brazil among his
early backers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The endorsement from all the ministers came late, but it was
encouraging,'' Koch-Weser said in a phone interview. ``Now we have
to go out and mobilize support from the member governments, and I
am quite confident that we can do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of Fischer, the deputy managing director, argue that
he has a good shot as well.
</P>
<P>
   Although he's Jewish and American, his candidacy was first
broached by Angola and backed by Iraq and Syria, among nearly two
dozen developing country thought to favor him for the job. Because
the fund focuses on helping poor countries cope with capitalism,
support from a diverse array of developing nations is seen as
crucial.
</P>
<P>
   Fischer, a soft-spoken technocrat who ran the fund day to day
under Camdessus, also has had a long and close relationship with
Treasury Secretary Lawrence H. Summers. Fischer once taught Summers
at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Some Europeans think
that the United States secretly supports Fischer, a view Clinton
administration officials dismiss as a conspiracy theory with no
grounding in reality.
</P>
<P>
   Some administration officials do seem partial to Fischer but
fear that the IMF would become a trans-Atlantic political football
if they sought to install an American in the top post. European
nations put up most of the money for the fund, meaning that they
could hobble its activities if they felt it had become an American
protectorate. The Clinton administration also feels that it does
not lack for influence at the fund as things stand.
</P>
<P>
   With the United States withholding its imprimatur on any of the
current candidates, the most likely outcome is for the first round
of jockeying to end in stalemate. Clinton administration officials
say that they hope that will prompt Europe to withdraw Koch-Weser
from contention and produce a new candidate who would then move
into the job with American support.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Publicly, there are no other European contenders for the job.
But were European officials to withdraw Koch-Weser's nomination,
the speculation is that they would be inclined to nominate someone
of significantly higher political stature, in part to save German
face.
</P>
<P>
   Among the long list of possible replacement candidates are
Gordon Brown, Britain's current chancellor of the exchequer;
Giuliano Amato, the Italian treasury secretary; Mario Draghi, the
Italian treasury director, and Andrew Crockett, who heads the Bank
for International Settlements in Basel, Switzerland.

<TEXT>
<P>
   VIRGINIA BEACH, Va. _ Taking his presidential campaign to a
stronghold of Christian conservatism, Sen. John McCain of Arizona
delivered a harsh attack Monday on the ``self-appointed leaders''
of the religious right, depicting them as intolerant empire
builders who ``have turned good causes into businesses'' while
attempting to exclude all but ``card-carrying Republicans'' from
the party.
</P>
<P>
   McCain singled out for criticism two of the Christian right's
best-known leaders, Pat Robertson, the founder of the Christian
Coalition, and the Rev. Jerry Falwell, the founder of the Moral
Majority. He compared Robertson to ``union bosses who have
subordinated the interests of working families to their own
ambitions,'' and he accused both men of attempting to distort his
position on abortion and ``smear the reputations of my
supporters.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The politics of division and slander are not our values,''
McCain said during a somber address to some 4,000 people who packed
a high school gymnasium here only 30 miles from the headquarters of
the Christian Coalition. ``They are corrupting influences on
religion and politics and those who practice them in the name of
religion or in the name of the Republican Party or in the name of
America shame our faith, our party and our country.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain's remarks came on the eve of another primary day in what
has become a bitter battle with Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, a
fight that has become increasingly focused on the appeals Bush made
to religious conservatives in winning the South Carolina primary.
And while McCain's statements Monday may cost him votes among the
religious right in Virginia, whose contest is one of three to be
held on Tuesday, his aides were counting on media coverage to
attract more moderate voters in New York, Ohio and California _ who
vote on March 7 and are more crucial to McCain's overall strategy.
</P>
<P>
   Campaigning in Washington state Monday, Bush dismissed McCain's
remarks. ``This is a political game that Senator McCain is trying
to play by pitting one group of people against another,'' he said
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a problem-solver,'' he added. ``It sounds like he's a
finger-pointer.''
</P>
<P>
   Robertson could not be reached for comment, but the Christian
Coalition released a statement saying, ``Christian Coalition will
rise above this transparent effort to divide one American from
another on the basis of religion. Our pro-family message of faith
and freedom will draw citizens to the polls in record numbers as we
encourage all people of faith to continue their active involvement
in the process we call Democracy.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for Falwell said he would have no comment. During
his address, and again in interviews with reporters, McCain
repeatedly framed his speech not as an attack on the Christian
right, but as an appeal to religious conservatives to join him in
condemning political tactics pursued by Robertson and Falwell on
behalf of Bush..
</P>
<P>
   As he has for weeks, McCain on Monday accused Robertson of
slandering his national campaign co-chairman, former Sen. Warren
Rudman, R-Vt., in telephone calls to voters, by calling him a
``vicious bigot'' for criticisms he had made of the religious
right. McCain also suggested that leaders of the religious right
may have been behind other calls and e-mails to voters accusing him
of fathering children out of wedlock and pointing out that he and
his wife, Cindy, have adopted a daughter from Bangladesh.
</P>
<P>
   ``Neither party,'' he added, ``should be defined by pandering to
the outer reaches of American politics and the agents of
intolerance, whether they be Louis Farrakhan or Al Sharpton on the
left, or Pat Robertson and Jerry Falwell on the right.
</P>
<P>
   ``Political intolerance by any political party is neither a
Judeo-Christian nor an American value,'' he also said.
</P>
<P>
   On his campaign bus, he told reporters, ``Before South Carolina,
I don't think I would have given a speech like this.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain's aides said the speech was partly intended to
reemphasize Bush's avid support from Christian conservatives one
day after he expressed regret, in a letter to Cardinal John
O'Connor of New York, for an address he gave at Bob Jones
University, a bastion of the religious right in South Carolina
whose leaders have spoken harshly of Catholics and banned
interracial dating.
</P>
<P>
   McCain referred to Bush in his speech as a ``Pat Robertson
Republican who will lose to Al Gore,'' and later, his press aides
distributed a packet of campaign materials and news reports that
they said showed numerous links between Bush's campaign and top
officials at Bob Jones University. One Bush flyer quoted Bob
Taylor, a dean at Bob Jones University, praising Bush for his
``pro-family leadership.''
</P>
<P>
   More broadly, McCain described his speech as part of an effort
to redefine the Republican Party itself, to move it closer to the
center, much as President Clinton tried to do to the Democratic
Party during his 1992 campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are the party of Ronald Reagan, not Pat Robertson,'' McCain
said in his speech. ``We are the party of Theodore Roosevelt, not
the party of special interests. We are the party of Abraham
Lincoln, not Bob Jones. Join us. Join us.''
</P>
<P>
   As he concluded, the crowd _ half of which were high school
students _ stood and applauded enthusiastically.
</P>
<P>
   Bush scoffed at the senator's claims: ``Ronald Reagan didn't
point fingers. He never played to people's religious fears, as
Senator McCain has shamelessly done.''
</P>
<P>
   In California, Leslie Goodman, a Republican political consultant
in Sacramento who backs Bush, said of McCain: ``Truly, the prince
of candor has turned into the king of media pander. But what he is
really doing is confirming to rank-and-file Republicans that he's
at war with everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   According to McCain's aides, the idea of the speech was first
suggested by McCain's campaign manager, Rick Davis, during a flight
on Friday from San Diego to Cleveland. As McCain's senior advisers
debated whether to make a campaign stop in Maryland or Virginia,
Davis suggested going to Virginia and making a speech some place
like Lynchburg, where Falwell is based. But the campaign settled on
Robertson's back yard instead. ``It's not just a major moment in
this campaign, it's a major moment for social conservatives,'' said
Marshall Wittman, a former legislative director for the Christian
Coalition who advises McCain and joined the campaign for the
speech.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday McCain's speechwriter, Marc Salter, began drafting the
address, and revisions continued until an hour before the speech.
There was an air of anticipation about McCain as his bus pulled up
to Cox High School. McCain, who likes to encourage the view that he
is a straight talker who refuses to pander to audiences, said he
relished the prospect of taking on Robertson in what one aide
described as a ``target-rich environment.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I must admit,'' McCain said before getting off the bus, ``that
being on the Death Star is an environment we've become comfortable
with.''
</P>
<P>
   But while McCain was offering up jaunty Star Wars metaphors and
insisting he was unconcerned by the political risks of criticizing
the leaders of the religious right, he and his aides took several
steps to minimize the chances that some would interpret his words
as an attack on all Christian fundamentalists.
</P>
<P>
   They made certain to stud the speech with signposts of McCain's
conservative record _ from his eagerness to ban partial birth
abortions, to opposition of tax increases, to his admiration for
Ronald Reagan. And during his speech, McCain was careful to praise
several leaders of the religious right, including Chuck Colson,
founder of Prison Fellowship, an evangelical group that ministers
to inmates.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let me be clear,'' McCain said. ``Evangelical leaders are
changing America for the better.''
</P>
<P>
   He also brought along with him a well-known social conservative,
Gary Bauer, a former Republican presidential candidate and once the
executive director of the Family Research Council. ``If this were
an attack on Christian voters I wouldn't be here today,'' said
Bauer, who endorsed McCain shortly after he dropped out of the
race.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Still, there was no disguising the extraordinary sight of a
major Republican candidate so directly and vehemently denouncing
two highly visible leaders from the very wing of the party that for
nearly 20 years has been a dominant force in getting Republicans
elected.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether he was concerned that his speech might rupture the
Republican Party, McCain flipped the question around toward
Robertson and Falwell.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've already ripped the party apart with what they did in
South Carolina and other campaigns,'' he said as his campaign
airplane left Virginia for the West Coast. ``I'm trying to bring
the party back together.''
</P>
<P>
   Several aides pointed out that reconciliation was central to the
one passage in the speech that brought a hush over the otherwise
squirming high school students. In the passage, McCain recounted
the time he was tied up in ``torture ropes'' and left in an empty
room after his capture in the Vietnam War. A guard, he said,
loosened the ropes, then tightened them before his ``less
humanitarian comrades returned.''
</P>
<P>
   Months later, McCain said, the two of them stood together in the
prison courtyard on a Christmas morning. Without uttering a word,
McCain said, the guard drew a cross in the dirt with his sandal.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is my faith,'' McCain said. ``The faith that unites and
never divides, the faith that bridges unbridgeable gaps in
humanity.''

   WASHINGTON _ The government on Monday issued new rules to
discourage abusive corporate tax shelters. Treasury Secretary
Lawrence H. Summers said the proliferation of such shelters ``may
be the most serious compliance issue threatening the American tax
system today.''
</P>
<P>
   The regulations are aimed at forcing the disclosure of new kinds
of tax shelters as soon as they are created so that they can be
reviewed by the IRS and, if found improper, can be banned before
they become widespread. This would replace the current practice of
uncovering the abuses through audits, often years later, and trying
to undo them in court, one case at a time.
</P>
<P>
   The new regulations, effective immediately, are intended to curb
the use of accounting methods that have no legitimate business
purpose and are designed solely to lower a company's taxes.
</P>
<P>
   As an example, Summers cited one newly uncovered arrangement
that is apparently spreading quickly. A company makes two loans of
equal amounts at equal interest rates to a partner. Later the
interest rate on one loan is dropped to zero, while the interest
rate on the other loan is doubled. The loan on which no interest is
being paid can be counted as a loss on the company's tax return,
while the loan at the doubled interest rate is placed on the books
of an overseas affiliate not taxed in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Summers said such transactions ``are devoid of economic
substance'' and serve no purpose except evading taxes.
</P>
<P>
   The new regulations would require corporations to disclose
shelters on their tax returns if any two of six conditions are met.
One of those conditions would be that a fee of more than $100,000
was paid to an outside firm for help in creating the shelter. Many
accounting, law and Wall Street firms arrange shelters for a fee.
Another condition would be any understanding that the technique
would be confidential.
</P>
<P>
   The regulations would also require that the firms that arrange
such shelters disclose the deals to the IRS as soon as they begin
offering them. The firms would be required to keep records for
seven years of who bought these shelters, and details of how they
work, and to make these files available to the IRS.
</P>
<P>
   To dissuade lawyers and accountants from recommending dubious
tax shelters, the rules that govern the conduct of professionals
representing clients before the IRS will be tightened in the next
six months. Both professionals and their firms will be subject to
suspension and ``in extreme cases'' may be barred from all IRS
proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Summers said, a special squad of IRS auditors will
analyze tax shelters and help those who examine corporate tax
returns identify abusive transactions.
</P>
<P>
   He also said meetings will be held to encourage business leaders
to support the attack on tax shelters. This may include calling on
the chief executives of companies that engage in questionable
shelters, and the heads of firms that promote them, to tell them
that their conduct is out of line, said Jonathan Talisman, the
acting assistant secretary for tax policy.
</P>
<P>
   Abusive tax shelters cost the government $10 billion annually,
according to the official Treasury estimate, but Summers said in a
speech Monday that this ``is just the tip of the iceberg'' and the
actual figure may be many times larger.

PACIFIC CENTURY CYBERWORKS TO PURCHASE HONG KONG TELEPHONE
COMPANY 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: new lede, complete update and rewrite of early version) 
(jt) 
 By ANDREW SORKIN with MARK LANDLER    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   HONG KONG _ The hometown hero beat the foreign interloper
Tuesday in the battle for Hong Kong's telephone company.
</P>
<P>
   The British parent company of Cable &AMP; Wireless HKT voted to
accept a $35 billion stock-and-cash offer from Pacific Century
CyberWorks, an Internet upstart, according to several executives
briefed on the decision. Pacific Century won the bidding over a
similar offer from Singapore Telecommunications, the state-run
phone company in Hong Kong's main Asian financial rival.
</P>
<P>
   The board of Cable &AMP; Wireless PLC, meeting Monday night in
London, selected Pacific Century's bid, despite the seeming
riskiness of such a choice. Pacific Century, which is only nine
months old, has no experience in telecommunications and few
tangible assets. But the board was apparently persuaded by Richard
Li, the company's 33-year-old founder who has emerged as one of
Asia's Internet stars.
</P>
<P>
   Li is the son of Li Ka-shing, a legendary Hong Kong tycoon and
one of the most politically connected businessmen in Asia.
Executives close to Singapore Telecommunications complained Tuesday
that politics played a role in their defeat. Hong Kong and mainland
China authorities had cast a cold eye on Singapore's campaign to
take over Hong Kong's dominant local telephone company.
</P>
<P>
   But Pacific Century marshaled impressive resources in the course
of the serpentine three-week battle. The company lined up $13
billion in loans from a consortium of banks, including Bank of
China, HSBC Holdings, Bank Nationale de Paris and Barclays. It also
raised $1 billion in a share placement in less than two hours.
</P>
<P>
   Executives close to the company said Pacific Century's $35
billion offer consists of about $12 billion in cash and $23 billion
in stock. Cable &AMP; Wireless owns 54.4 percent of Cable &AMP; Wireless
HKT, which means it would receive slightly over $6 billion in cash.
Cable &AMP; Wireless will also receive Pacific Century shares, giving
it a stake of between 10 percent and 20 percent in Li's company.
</P>
<P>
   Reached in Hong Kong on Tuesday morning Li said he planned to
turn Cable &AMP; Wireless HKT into a regional power. ``We've got some
very good plans for HKT,'' he said. ``The company has always been
told that it had to stay in Hong Kong because its parent was
expanded internationally. What we plan to do is expand the company
regionally.''
</P>
<P>
   Pacific Century also made an all-stock offer, which values Cable
&AMP; Wireless HKT at $38.5 billion. But people briefed on the deal
said the British parent company and other shareholders were likely
to opt for stock and cash.
</P>
<P>
   Pacific Century's victory came after furious last-minute
maneuvering by Singapore Telecommunications. The company announced
that Rupert Murdoch's News Corp. would invest $1 billion in its
campaign. News Corp. also set up an Internet, television and
mobile-phone joint venture with the company.
</P>
<P>
   But Murdoch's involvement was not enough to turn the tide of
sentiment against Pacific Century, which had managed to became the
front-runner for Cable &AMP; Wireless HKT from the moment it announced
its interest in the company on Feb. 10.
</P>
<P>
   Although Pacific Century barged into advanced merger
negotiations between Singapore Telecommunications and Cable &AMP;
Wireless HKT, the prospect of such a deal had failed to excite many
people here _ either inside the Hong Kong company, in the
government, or in Hong Kong's financial markets.
</P>
<P>
   ``Getting bigger doesn't necessarily mean they get better,''
said Dylan Tinker, an analyst at Deutsche Securities here said last
week.
</P>
<P>
   Singapore Telecommunications is perceived as a solid but stodgy
company in a small and still-closeted telecommunications market.
Although Cable &AMP; Wireless HKT had fallen out of favor with many
analysts, it has been competing in Hong Kong's market, which has
been deregulated more rapidly than Singapore.
</P>
<P>
   Politically, Singapore Telecommunications was not popular
either. Although the Hong Kong government declared it would not
stand in the way of the deal, it was clear that neither Hong Kong
nor the mainland Chinese welcomed the prospect.
</P>
<P>
   Pacific Century, on the other hand, offers the alluring prospect
of turning Cable &AMP; Wireless HKT into the platform for a regional
Internet giant. Li has already assembled a portfolio of stakes in
Internet start-ups that rivals Softbank of Japan and CMGI of the
United States. In two months, he plans to begin a
satellite-delivered Internet-access service known as Network of the
World.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is about creating an Internet powerhouse in Asia, with
its roots in Hong Kong,'' said a senior Pacific Century executive,
speaking on condition of anonymity. ``The more we examine it, the
more we see the strengths of HKT.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, managing a lumbering former monopoly with tens of
thousands of employees will be a steep challenge for Pacific
Century, which is run with all the cheerful chaos of any Internet
start-up. Helping Li somewhat will be his chief deputy, Alex Arena,
who is the former head telecommunications regulator in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts speculate that Pacific Century will carve up Cable &AMP;
Wireless HKT _ selling the less attractive local and long-distance
phone business to another phone company, while keeping the
company's Internet-related holdings.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is kind of similar to AT&AMP;T buying up cable assets in the
United States,'' Greg Feldberg, a technology analyst at Indosuez
W.I. Carr Securities in Hong Kong said last week. ``They see that
they need partnerships with local operators, so they feel more
comfortable owning stakes in companies.''
</P>
<P>
   Last November, Cable &AMP; Wireless HKT set up a joint venture with
Star TV, which is owned by News Corp., to create a pay-television
and Internet service. The future of that venture, however, is now
in doubt. News Corp. threw its support behind Singapore
Telecommunications in the battle, and Murdoch might unravel the
venture, rather than go into business with Li.
</P>
<P>
   Among the major imponderables for Cable &AMP; Wireless in the next
few days will be the value of Pacific Century's shares. Under the
stock portion of the deal, the British company will receive 0.71
Pacific Century share for each HKT share. The cash portion will be
7.23 Hong Kong dollars, or 93 cents United States a share.
</P>
<P>
   But Pacific Century's shares have been suspended for two trading
sessions, which has had the effect of locking in the value of its
stock offer. Some market experts said the stock would plummet once
it begins trading again. One market watcher noted that there was
evidence in the grey market that investors had begun borrowing
Pacific Century shares to short-sell the stock.
</P>
<P>
   ``My feeling is that the shares would have been substantially
lower than they were last week, said Marc Faber, the head of an
investment firm here.
</P>
<P>
   Having said that, Faber said he thought Li was wise to use his
stock to bid for a company with genuine assets. Aside from a
portfolio of investments in Internet start-ups, Pacific Century
CyberWorks is a company that exists largely in blue-prints. It has
no customers and no operating profits.
</P>
<P>
   ``The heyday of Hong Kong Telecom is over,'' Faber said. ``But
when you've got free money like Richard Li does, any purchase is
better than none.''

EXECUTIVE SAYS PHILIP MORRIS IS OPEN TO SOME REGULATION OF TOBACCO
INDUSTRY  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By BARRY MEIER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A top executive of Philip Morris Cos. said Monday that the
nation's largest cigarette maker would no longer oppose some
government regulation of the tobacco industry.
</P>
<P>
   The company's senior vice president, Steven Parrish, said the
company still opposed efforts by the Food and Drug Administration
to classify nicotine as a drug and cigarettes as drug-delivery
devices.
</P>
<P>
   But he said the company would be willing to talk with
antismoking advocates and government officials about regulating
cigarettes in such areas as selling to young people, disclosing
ingredients and conducting research on safer products.
</P>
<P>
   Parrish's comments come as Philip Morris attempts to recast its
tarnished image and are the strongest indication yet that the
cigarette giant might accept some government regulation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe that there should be some discussion about what is
the right way to regulate tobacco,'' said Parrish, who is expected
to outline the company's position during a panel discussion
Thursday at a meeting of experts on smoking and health in
California.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, two antismoking advocates who were told of the company's
stance expressed sharply different views.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. David Kessler, the former head of the FDA said in a
telephone interview that he welcomed the step, calling it
``historic.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course you need to look at this with a degree of
skepticism,'' said Kessler, the dean of the Yale Medical School.
``But the fact that Philip Morris has said that this product needs
to be regulated is historic.''
</P>
<P>
   Matthew Myers, the executive director of the Campaign for
Tobacco-Free Kids, an advocacy group in Washington, said he was
highly suspect of the company's position, which he said he viewed
as a pre-emptive strike.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that Philip Morris believes that cigarettes will be
forced to accept some form of government regulation and what they
are trying to do is foreclose government action,'' Myers said.
</P>
<P>
   At the moment, however, the major problems faced by Philip
Morris and other cigarette makers are in the courtrooms rather than
legislative forums.
</P>
<P>
   A Miami jury is expected to award punitive damages soon against
the tobacco industry in a major class-action lawsuit brought on
behalf of Florida smokers.
</P>
<P>
   Also, the U.S. Supreme Court is expected to soon decide the
issue of whether the FDA was given authority by Congress to
regulate the tobacco industry. Arguments in that case were heard
last year and most justices appeared skeptical of arguments by the
government that Congress had delegated that power to the FDA
</P>
<P>
   Parrish said he believed it was important to begin a public
discussion about the best way to regulate tobacco soon after the
Supreme Court made its decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to be an interested party with a seat at the table,''
Parrish said.
</P>
<P>
   Parrish said Philip Morris was still opposed to regulating
nicotine as a drug, but he added: ``We ought to take a step. Here
is a product that is addictive. So what is the right way to
regulate tobacco as tobacco rather than to characterize it as
something that it is not, a medical device or pharmaceutical?''
</P>
<P>
   Antismoking advocates had long taken the position that nicotine
is a drug and should be regulated as one.
</P>
<P>
   The comments of the Philip Morris official are part of a recent
effort by the cigarette maker to recast its image after being
battered in courtrooms and public forums as the battle over
cigarettes intensified in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   The effort includes a number of initiatives aimed at convincing
the public it is willing to address the problems associated with
its products.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, when it started a new Internet site, Philip Morris
acknowledged for the first time that scientific evidence showed
that smoking causes lung cancer and other deadly diseases, after
decades of disputing the findings of the surgeon general.
</P>
<P>
   The company also recently announced that after a decade of
research it had developed a new type of cigarette that would reduce
the likelihood of fires being started by dropped cigarettes.

 ANALYSIS: BUSH AND McCAIN DRAWING DIFFERENT ELEMENTS OF A FRACTURED(See also MCCAIN-RIGHT) 
(sw) 
 By ALISON MITCHELL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Gov. George W. Bush and Sen. John McCain are now
seeking the support of what amounts to two separate and quite
different Republican parties. Two decades after Ronald Reagan gave
the Christian right an honored place in the Republican coalition by
declaring before a convention of evangelical preachers that ``You
can't endorse me. But I endorse you,'' McCain on Monday denounced
Pat Robertson and Jerry Falwell as ``agents of intolerance.''
</P>
<P>
   The senator's sharp broadside against figures long considered an
important part of the Republican constituency was his most dramatic
break yet with Republican orthodoxy. But in a way it was just
another step in his evolving effort to create a new political
force.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since this race began, McCain has been using issues that
are anathema to the conservative wing of his party _ from
overhauling the campaign finance laws to shunning large tax cuts in
favor of shoring up Social Security _ to draw thousands of new
voters to what he argues could be a ``bigger Republican Party, a
party that can claim a governing majority for a generation or
more.''
</P>
<P>
   In his vision it is a force composed of less conservative
Republicans, Ross Perot's independents and the suburban swing
voters who twice helped elect Bill Clinton. And his aides admit
that along the way they may have to leave some of their party
behind.
</P>
<P>
   ``The campaign didn't start with the idea that we are creating a
new party,'' John Weaver, McCain's political director, said
recently. But now that it has taken that course, he said, ``if we
succeed, not all of the party will be with us.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush is trying to preserve and straddle the coalition that
Reagan built stretching from evangelical Christians to the Catholic
Democrats who became known as Reagan Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Governor Bush is following the classic Reagan model,''
said Ralph Reed, the former executive director of the Christian
Coalition, who now advises Bush. ``Begin with core conservative
voters. Move from there to rank-and-file Republicans. Then move to
independents. Then move out to conservative Democrats. It's a
dynamic process.''
</P>
<P>
   But what Reed sees as logical and smooth progression has become
anything but.
</P>
<P>
   With each passing day, as Bush and McCain have traded off
primary victories, the race has become ever more bitter as each
side vies for potential pieces of the coalition: independents in
New Hampshire, religious conservatives in South Carolina and Reagan
Democrats in Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   Now, some Republicans and Democrats alike are wondering whether
the pitched primary battle will not create a new force but simply
leave the Republicans in tatters.
</P>
<P>
   ``This fight may have been inevitable but its also going to be
extremely difficult ever to put the Republican party back together
again,'' said Sen. Robert G. Torricelli, the New Jersey Democrat
who heads his party's Senate election effort.
</P>
<P>
   And in Virginia, Sen. John Warner, a Bush supporter, said the
disputes between McCain and Bush had reached ``crisis proportions''
and called for the party to ``get back on the issues.''
</P>
<P>
   The intense face-off has come as a shock to the party
establishment, which had once expected Republicans to quickly
coalesce around Bush, a sunny conservative with crossover appeal to
moderates and new immigrants whose image could replace the outdated
Bob Dole or the polarizing Newt Gingrich _ in short, give the party
a unifying figure it has lacked since the Reagan days.
</P>
<P>
   Yet even through both Bush and McCain are southwestern
conservatives who originally wanted to play down social issues and
make the party more inclusive, they have become magnets drawing to
them different elements of their fractured party.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, with his appeal to Democrats and independents, is trying
to assemble a coalition that taps into the movement started by Ross
Perot and his Reform Party.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is an overwhelming desire among the American electorate
for an end to politics as usual,'' said Marshall Wittmann, an
adviser to McCain. ``We first saw that in '92 with the Perot
phenomenon,'' he said. ``We then saw it in '98 in Minnesota. People
are looking for an end to the ideological polarization to American
politics.''
</P>
<P>
   Bill McInturff, McCain's pollster, said that in a national poll
he conducted he found 24 percent of primary voters nationally who
said they would support McCain voted for Perot in 1996. In
contrast, he said, only two percent of Bush's supporters voted for
Perot.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, who began his campaign hoping to bring new immigrants and
other new voters into the Republican fold, has been pushed by
McCain into running a primary campaign focused on the traditional
conservative Republican base. He has sought to energize the party's
core constituency by accusing McCain of ``hijacking'' the
Republican primaries by drawing Democrats and independents into
them.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Bush's supporters say that he is involved in a step-by-step
building process and that with the Republican base consolidated
behind him, he will eventually reassemble the winning Reagan
coalition of Christian conservatives, big business and the broad
middle class, including some Democrats and independents.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're very confident,'' said Ari Fleischer, a spokesman for
Bush, ``that independent voters who are terribly important and for
now are drawn to Senator McCain's candidacy, will in the end come
home to George Bush when the choice is between Bush and Gore.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain's supporters argue that Republicans lost elections in
1996 and 1998 and will do so again unless they reshape their
coalition and their message to account for the nation's new
prosperity and the rise of the suburbs, whose swing voters turned
to President Clinton in droves in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``The conventional Republican view of the last few years is we
had bad luck,'' said William Kristol, the editor of The Weekly
Standard, who is supporting McCain. ``We were out maneuvered by
Clinton. Gingrich messed up and Dole messed up. But basically the
party is in good shape. The conservative movement is in good shape
and all we need is a better messenger.''
</P>
<P>
   But the question facing McCain is whether a strategy that might
work in a general election can prevail in Republican primaries.
After Tuesday's primaries in Virginia and Washington, the race
moves away from open primaries that allow non-Republicans to vote
to primaries limited to or heavily weighted to Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're losing badly among Republicans sooner or later in
these Republican closed primaries, western and southern primaries,
they're going to be more like South Carolina,'' said Sen. Paul D.
Coverdell, the Georgia Republican who is Bush's chief liaison to
Senate Republicans. ``I just don't see how he gets to the end of
the road with this strategy.''
</P>
<P>
   One risk for McCain is that some Republican constituency groups
are likely to feel his way of shaking things up, as well as the
coalition he is building, is simply not Republican enough.
</P>
<P>
   Grover Norquist, the head of American for Tax Reform, which has
run ads against McCain, says he finds it hard to tell what side
McCain stands on in the political wars despite his largely
conservative voting record.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Bush argument is `I'm on the good team,''' Norquist said.
`McCain's argument is, `it's all corrupt. I'll go to Washington and
fix it.' So now you're not on either team.'' He said, ''The
argument that both are equally corrupt doesn't impress
Republicans.''
</P>
<P>
   Coverdell said many of McCain's colleagues cannot live with his
position on issues like a tobacco tax or overhaul of the campaign
finance laws. He pointed to a line in McCain's victory speech after
winning in Michigan and Arizona in which he urged Republicans not
to fear him but to join him.
</P>
<P>
   ``What would ever prompt a candidate for president to stand up
to his own party and say you don't have to be afraid of me?''
Coverdell asked. If such sentiments don't abate, should McCain
become the party nominee, he could lose a significant part of his
coalition _ particularly if Buchanan is running on the Reform Party
line.
</P>
<P>
   ``The challenge for Senator McCain should he become the nominee
would be keeping the conservative base of the party inside the big
tent,'' said Whit Ayres, a Republican pollster unaligned with
either campaign.
</P>
<P>
   And for Bush the challenge could be how to recapture his image
as a broader-based candidate after McCain has so repeatedly tarred
him as the candidate of the far right. Bush's letter to Cardinal
John O'Connor, expressing ``deep regret'' over his missed
opportunity to criticize anti-Catholic views when he visited Bob
Jones University, seemed a step in that direction.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Here in central Brooklyn _ where storefronts are
boarded, housing projects stand in defiant opposition to the boom
times, and the hospitals are more or less broke _ babies are dying
at rates that the city as a whole has not seen in nearly two
decades. And they die, in some cases, at a rate double what the
federal government has set as the infant mortality goal for the
nation.
</P>
<P>
   Often they die months before they were meant to be born, their
bodies a tangle of minute bones and skin, weighed in grams rather
than pounds. Some never see their mother's faces; they are gone
right after birth. Others leave the hospital with a shopping bag of
drugs and a mother overwhelmed by her own myriad problems, and do
not make it to their first birthday.
</P>
<P>
   While the infant mortality rate in New York City has fallen
steadily in the last decade, it has fallen much more slowly in
neighborhoods like Bedford-Stuyvesant and Brownsville,
neighborhoods in Brooklyn with considerable populations of new
immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   In New York City in 1998, babies less than a year old died at a
rate of 6.8 per 1,000, which is slightly better than the national
average, 7.2. Bedford-Stuyvesant, however, has one of the highest
rates in the country, 14 per 1,000, a 20 percent increase over
1997. The last time the average rate of infant mortality was so
high in New York City overall was 1983.
</P>
<P>
   That the number is on the rise at all is startling. It stands
against the national trend even in cities with severe social
problems, like Washington, where the rate is 12.5 per 1,000.
</P>
<P>
   In Brownsville, the story is much the same; the rate slides up
and down each year, averaging about 10 deaths per 1,000 babies in
the last five years. While the disparity between children of black
mothers and those of white mothers has always been stark, there is
evidence that the gap is closing elsewhere in the city. The infant
mortality rate in the Tremont section of the Bronx, for example, is
8.1, a 54 percent decrease from 1988.
</P>
<P>
   The figures have so concerned the city's health commissioner,
Dr. Neal L. Cohen, that he has made reducing infant mortality one
of his top priorities for this year.
</P>
<P>
   There seems to be no clear answer to why the same neighborhoods
stand out year after year, and why others buck the downward trends.
Experts seem to agree that even when the resources exist _ prenatal
care at low cost, hospitals willing to deliver babies,
government-subsidized infant formula and food _ it is still
profoundly difficult to get many pregnant women through the doors.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a perplexing question,'' said Dr. Katherine La Guardia,
who runs the ambulatory obstetrics and gynecology clinic at
Brookdale University Hospital and Medical Center in Brownsville.
``A huge amount of effort has gone into improving prenatal care,
but we still don't know how one reaches the most unreachable.''
</P>
<P>
   Those are the mothers who are addicted to drugs, who are HIV
positive, unemployed or living in New York as illegal immigrants.
Women who fit those descriptions often avoid going to see doctors
before they give birth _ out of fear, experts said, that their
babies would be taken from them or that they would be deported.
Others are discouraged by family members who do not believe in
prenatal care or are suspicious of the entire medical system.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question is: How do we make women less afraid to get
care?'' La Guardia said.
</P>
<P>
   Other mothers want prenatal care but cannot get it, because they
live too far from a health clinic or hospital, or have small
children and no one at home to care for them while they make the
trek to the doctor.
</P>
<P>
   There are also anomalies that cannot be readily explained. For
instance, neighborhoods with a high concentration of immigrants
from the Caribbean seem to report the highest infant mortality
figures. ``What is interesting about Bedford is that 42.1 percent
of the women are foreign-born,'' said Dr. Tanya Pagan Paggio, an
associate professor of medicine at the City University of New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is important because when you look at other places in the
city where there is a high level of foreign-born, infant mortality
rates are closer to 6 percent,'' Paggio said. ``In Bedford, there
are a lot of Caribbean people. And we know that Jamaican women have
a 9.4 per 1,000 rate, Haitian women have about 11 per 1,000 and
rates among women from Trinidad and Tobago are also high. You have
to wonder if these women have access to services they need.''
</P>
<P>
   Robin Bennett is desperate not to let her baby become another
sad statistic. At 23, she is pregnant with her fourth child, who
has a heart problem. One son is in foster care, and the other lives
with her mother. Her 18-month-old daughter lives with Bennett in a
government-subsidized apartment in Bedford-Stuyvesant.
</P>
<P>
   Her problems are as complicated as they are numerous: Her
apartment is full of roaches that bite her daughter, she said,
adding that one of her children was a result of a rape. Her mother,
who has AIDS, is her main line of support.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes I cry at night because I wonder if the stress in my
life gave this baby her hole in her heart,'' Bennett said. She has
sought help from Brooklyn Perinatal Network, an organization that
tries to keep babies like Bennett's from dying by shepherding women
into prenatal care, advocating for them on housing issues and
giving other social support.
</P>
<P>
   A lack of access to housing, nutritious food and adult support
may contribute to infant mortality as much as poor medical care,
many experts say.
</P>
<P>
   ``Prenatal care has probably been overstated,'' said Dawn Misra,
an associate professor at the Johns Hopkins School of Public Health
and an expert on infant mortality. ``If you look at a program like
Healthy Start, you see it is a broader initiative with resources
like food, social support and other things like smoking-cessation
clinics, which is important because smoking may lead to
low-birth-weight babies, and low birth weight is the leading cause
of infant mortality.''
</P>
<P>
   When Bedford-Stuyvesant lost a majority of its financing in 1997
for Healthy Start, a federal program intended to help poor women
have healthy babies, the infant mortality rate shot up, said Ngosi
Moses, who runs the Brooklyn Perinatal Network. ``When resources
became scarce, those rates rose,'' Ngosi said. ``This shows you
when money is put into the community, good things happen, and when
the money is pulled out, they go out.''
</P>
<P>
   The $6.8 million that was spread over 22 programs in the early
1990s now has to cover 94 programs.
</P>
<P>
   Brownsville is a neighborhood that a decade of economic
expansion seems to have left untouched, where Healthy Start does
not even exist. Rows of private houses are boarded up, and stores
are scarce, save for a few of the dollar-bin variety.
</P>
<P>
   The number of people, especially women, who are infected with
the AIDS virus is ``astonishing,'' La Guardia said.
</P>
<P>
   In most hospitals in the city, it is almost a given that a new
mother will leave the maternity ward with a healthy baby in her
arms. In Brownsville, it is often just short of a victory.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   La Guardia and her boss, Dr. Martin Gimovsky, who heads the
obstetrics department at Brookdale, spend their days trying to
unravel the histories and medical problems of the poor women who
come through its clinics and labor and delivery floor each day.
Many have never had a day of prenatal care.
</P>
<P>
   On a recent Wednesday afternoon, during Gimovsky's clinic for
women with high-risk pregnancies, dozens of women crammed into a
waiting room. Almost all of them had had children before, including
the recently homeless woman with AIDS who did not know her due date
and had had virtually no prenatal care.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've gained weight,'' the resident examining her said
reassuringly. ``Well, I'm living somewhere now, so I am much more
relaxed,'' said the woman, who would not give her name.
</P>
<P>
   Cynthia Martinez, who has three children and is pregnant with a
fourth, still calls her first baby, the one who was stillborn, by
her name, Cynthia Michelle. ``She is 10 now,'' she said. The baby
stopped moving at seven months, and by the time Martinez delivered
her, the doctors told her the baby was dead.
</P>
<P>
   Distraught, Martinez said that she grabbed the baby of the woman
she shared a room with and refused to let her go. ``I just kept
saying, `You can't take this baby from me,'' Martinez, 24,
remembered. ``I guess I thought she was mine. My mother told me
that God had taken one from me but would give me more.''
</P>
<P>
   Few patients at Brookdale, one of the city's most financially
strained hospitals, pay the full price of their care, if they pay
at all. Many are covered by the Prenatal Care Assistance Program, a
state-financed program for poor pregnant women.
</P>
<P>
   ``We work with the patients no one wants,'' said Gimovsky, a
plump and congenial doctor, who jokes easily with the teen-age
girls who fill the cramped clinic space. He recruited La Guardia by
likening her work to that of the Peace Corps. ``You don't make any
money at this,'' he said cheerfully, ``but this is what I want to
do with my life.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the infant mortality rates are historically lower in
Brownsville than in Bedford-Stuyvesant, the March of Dimes
earmarked the neighborhood for a $152,000 program to try to get
more women into services. It is also pushing legislators in Albany
to raise the maximum income women may earn and still qualify for
prenatal care.
</P>
<P>
   La Guardia has been at Brookdale for only a few months. Unlike
Gimovsky, she is businesslike, almost stern, and deeply weary over
the hospital's dire fiscal situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am still in shock,'' she said. Money would permit the hiring
of more doctors and nurses. Ultrasound machines, standard equipment
in any Manhattan obstetrics office, are scarce. A portable
ultrasound, the latest in technology, is unheard of.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly, there are more dollars that need to be funneled into
this area,'' La Guardia said. ``You wonder if there is any hope.''

 McENROE GETS COMMITMENT FROM SAMPRAS FOR DAVIS CUP   By BRIAN FIDELMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   John McEnroe on Monday named his dream pairing, Pete Sampras and
Andre Agassi, to the Davis Cup team that will face the Czech
Republic in the quarterfinals in April.
</P>
<P>
   This is the lineup that the United States captain had planned
for the first-round match in Zimbabwe earlier this month. But
Sampras pulled out with a hip injury, and the United States barely
survived.
</P>
<P>
   McEnroe said he would name the team's other two players a few
weeks before the round, which will be played at the Great Western
Forum in Los Angeles from April 7-9. A favorite of McEnroe's is
Chris Woodruff, a 27-year-old Davis Cup rookie who was a
replacement in Zimbabwe. Woodruff lost his first singles match, but
withstood enormous pressure in the deciding match and saved
McEnroe's coaching debut with an emotional victory to give the
United States a 3-2 escape.
</P>
<P>
   ``I almost feel like it would be a shame if he wasn't on the
team,'' McEnroe said in a conference call. ``What he went out there
and accomplished is something I feel like was very special.''
</P>
<P>
   McEnroe has made no secret that he wants to see Sampras make a
greater commitment to Davis Cup.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether there would be any lingering resentment among
other players toward Sampras that might affect team chemistry,
McEnroe said, ``I think that's my job in a sense, to try to build
team chemistry.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In general Pete has expressed mixed feelings himself, and the
people he's expressed it with in a lot of cases are the players
themselves,'' McEnroe said. ``The players are as aware or more
aware of his feelings than perhaps a lot of the people that follow
the Davis Cup or the officials around it.''
</P>
<P>
   Sampras will play in April (``Obviously a lot easier if you're
playing in Los Angeles to commit to that,'' McEnroe said), but a
victory over the Czech Republic would lead to a semifinal in Spain
or Russia. ``As far as I know, yes, he's absolutely committed to at
least the rest of this year and hopefully beyond that.''
</P>
<P>
   Sampras and Agassi have not played together in Davis Cup since
1995, the last time the United States won the cup.

ANNAN WANTS U.N., NOT SADDAM, TO CONTROL MONEY FOR MECCA 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By BARBARA CROSSETTE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ Secretary-General Kofi Annan, in a decision
that is unlikely to be welcomed in Baghdad, has devised a plan to
pay for Iraqi pilgrimages to Mecca without letting the government
of Saddam Hussein disperse the money.
</P>
<P>
   The Security Council began discussions on the
secretary-general's plan on Monday. But there were concerns that
the Iraqis might provoke a confrontation if they were denied the
money on their terms. The pilgrimages start this week.
</P>
<P>
   The Iraqis, whose foreign earnings are controlled by the United
Nations, are permitted to draw money for the pilgrimages from oil
sale earnings. They had asked for $2,000 for each of the 24,700
pilgrims authorized to visit Mecca by the Organization of the
Islamic Conference. And they wanted the total of $49.4 million to
be deposited in Iraq's central bank so it could be distributed by
Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
   But Iraq, whose financial dealings are handled through an escrow
account, is not normally given such a large sum of money to handle
as it wishes.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq now says that only about 7,000 Iraqis may make the trip.
But whatever the number, Annan has not agreed that the money should
pass through Iraqi hands. He is proposing that pilgrims be given
about $250 each for the trip out of Iraq, to be supplied through
U.N. offices in Baghdad. The remainder of the money would be
deposited with designated agencies in Jordan or Saudi Arabia, to be
drawn on by Iraqis when they arrived there.
</P>
<P>
   Iraqis are now also permitted to fly to Mecca under the December
Security Council resolution, an exemption from a ban on commercial
flights to and from the country. But Iraq has not announced any
flights, and has said only that pilgrims will go by bus, beginning
Tuesday. Six bus groups are planned during the next week.
</P>
<P>
   Annan met on Monday with Hans von Sponeck, the U.N. relief
coordinator in Iraq, who announced earlier this month that he was
resigning on March 31 because he could not do the job of helping
Iraqis under the current sanctions, despite a more liberal
oil-sales program that lifted the ceiling on exports of oil and
made buying civilian commodities easier.
</P>
<P>
   After the 35-minute meeting, U.N. officials said that Annan, who
appeared businesslike and unsmiling as he greeted von Sponeck, made
clear to him that ``United Nations policy on the oil-for-food
program is set by the Security Council.'' But the secretary-general
said he would discuss von Sponeck's views with all concerned.
</P>
<P>
   A report by officials of the oil-sales program here is to be
presented to the Security Council on March 10. It is expected to
show that considerable quantities of not only food and medicines
but also a range of goods to improve schools, hospitals, farms,
water systems and electricity generation are arriving in Iraq
despite holds placed on many contracts by the United States and
Britain.
</P>
<P>
   Americans in particular are concerned that Iraqi imports are
increasing and becoming more diversified at a time when there are
no arms inspectors on the ground. Without inspections, there is no
way to verify that sophisticated equipment, chemicals or other
materials are not finding their way into weapons programs.

IOANNA, FORMER QUEEN OF BULGARIA, DIES AT 92 IN PORTUGAL  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: N.J., Portugal, Bulgaria, Italy, Germany, Argentina, Egypt
and Spain)  By DOUGLAS MARTIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ioanna, the Bulgarian queen whose marriage was blessed by
Mussolini and whose husband King Boris III may have been poisoned
by Hitler, died Saturday in her home in Estoril, Portugal. She was
92.
</P>
<P>
   Though her husband made a reluctant alliance with Hitler, she is
remembered for efforts to save Bulgarian Jews from the Nazis. She
and her two children, including Simeon, who became king at 6 when
his father died in 1943, were kept under house arrest by the
Gestapo.
</P>
<P>
   When the Communists came to power they held a mock referendum
calling for an end to the monarchy, and Ioanna fled into exile with
her children.
</P>
<P>
   The slender, cheerful woman, often called the ``country's
memory,'' represented an elegant thread between the days the world
watched the meaningful glances, dalliances and marriages of
European royalty like a sport, and the 20th-century specters of war
and revolution. Her roots reflected a breathtakingly exclusive
royal society, in which kings as often as not were cousins and
romance might serve political purposes, or vice versa.
</P>
<P>
   The queen was born Giovanna Elisabetta Antonio Romana Maria,
princess of Italy. Ioanna is the Bulgarian translation of her name.
</P>
<P>
   She was the third of four daughters of King Victor Emmanuel III,
who reigned from 1900 to 1946, and Queen Elena, one of the
daughters of King Nicholas of Montenegro. King Nicholas was known
for planting his daughters in the courts of Europe for use as
ambassadors and spies.
</P>
<P>
   Giovanna's early life was spent at the Villa Savoia, home of the
Italian royal family, where she was strictly raised by a governess.
She learned literature, history and Latin. She learned to play the
piano and spoke English and French.
</P>
<P>
   When she and her sister Mafalda were battling typhoid fever in
1923, there were almost daily reports on their condition in the
American newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   Giovanna's marital future became the subject of frequent
speculation. Possibilities included Prince Wilhelm, son of the
former crown prince of Germany; Prince Albrecht, son of the former
Crown Prince Ruprecht of Bavaria; Archduke Albrecht of Hapsburg,
who contended he should be king of Hungary; and Zog I, king of
Albania.
</P>
<P>
   Another frequently mentioned possibility was the Marquis de
Pinedo, a daring Italian aviator. The princess led off two court
balls of the 1927 season with the pilot, and he was her guest in
the royal box at the Davis Cup tennis matches later that year.
</P>
<P>
   Adding weight to that theory was her eldest sister's surprising
marriage to a fairly obscure cavalry captain, Count Calvi di
Bergola, six years earlier, for reasons of love alone. But the
marquis died in a fiery crash while taking off from Floyd Bennett
Field in Brooklyn in 1933.
</P>
<P>
   The most persistent rumor _ for more than five years _ coupled
her name with that of Boris III, the Bulgarian king. Some accounts
say they were secretly engaged for as long as three years. The king
was also the subject of intense marital speculation, with
possibilities ranging from a Chicago heiress to Princesses Maria
and Ileana of Romania.
</P>
<P>
   Boris ascended the throne at 24 in 1918 after the abdication of
his father, King Ferdinand, known as ``Foxy Ferdy,'' who was forced
into exile in Germany because of his support for that country in
World War I. Ferdinand cultivated the acquaintance of Goering and
other Nazis in the 1930s.
</P>
<P>
   King Boris, who was born a Roman Catholic but became Eastern
Orthodox early in life, met with Pope Pius XI to ask for permission
to marry the Roman Catholic princess. The king's father had been
excommunicated for allowing him to leave the church, but Boris
promised bring up any children as Roman Catholics. The pope
approved the marriage.
</P>
<P>
   The wedding, in the Basilica of Saint Francis of Assisi, was a
joyous occasion. Peasants lit bonfires and danced. The ladies of
the court wore simple costumes: dresses with high necks, long
sleeves, ankle-length skirts and no jewelry. There were 50 royal
princes. Mussolini also attended.
</P>
<P>
   After the wedding breakfast, the party made their way by train
and then yacht to Bulgaria. Boris reported by radio that all the
ladies in waiting, though not the queen, had been seasick.
</P>
<P>
   Reaching Sofia by another train, the newlyweds descended to a
railway platform strewn with chrysanthemums. A roar of welcome
greeted them, and they proceeded to the city's cathedral for an
Orthodox ceremony in the presence of 50 bishops. The next day, the
couple stood for seven hours accepting congratulations.
</P>
<P>
   They traveled widely within Bulgaria and abroad. Boris was known
for his interest in science and technology, and he loved driving
railway engines. In 1934 Ioanna startled the world when she
divulged that she could cook.
</P>
<P>
   ``Boris is very fond of home-cooked meals,'' she said in an
article in The New York American. ``The secret of domestic
happiness is to be found in the kitchen.''
</P>
<P>
   The first of the couple's two children, Marie-Louise, was born
in 1933, and to the consternation of the Vatican was baptized in
the Orthodox Church. The second, Simeon, was born in 1937, an event
celebrated in torchlight parades because only a man could rise to
the throne.
</P>
<P>
   He was also baptized in an Orthodox rite. Ioanna was not
excommunicated for snubbing the Vatican, although the pope
denounced ``Balkan tricks.''
</P>
<P>
   Boris tried to remain neutral as World War II broke out. He said
his wife was pro-Italian, his ministers pro-German and his people
pro-Russian, while he was neutral. But he met with Hitler in 1940,
and in 1941 became part of the pact allying Germany, Italy and
Japan.
</P>
<P>
   The king has long been described as having been appalled at
Hitler's massacres of Jews, and on two occasions he refused orders
to deport Bulgarian Jews. Ioanna intervened to obtain transit visas
to enable a number of Jews to escape to Argentina.
</P>
<P>
   In 1943 the king became ill during his second visit to Hitler.
At the time, many thought Hitler had pressed him, apparently
unsuccessfully, to join the second front against the Soviet Union,
but many historians now view such a plan as unlikely. The king fell
mortally ill soon after the visit and died at 49; there is
lingering suspicion that he was poisoned.
</P>
<P>
   But this was never proved. ``Such a conspiracy theory must
remain a mere conjecture, attractive only because alternative
explanations are so unsatisfactory,'' Marshall Lee Miller said in
his book ``Bulgaria During the Second World War'' (Stanford
University Press, 1975).
</P>
<P>
   Ioanna's son thus became King Simeon II at age 6. He ruled under
three adult regents. After the Communists took control of Bulgaria
in 1945, the regents were killed and three others appointed. Then,
on Sept. 8, 1946, the monarchy was voted out of existence, with 92
percent of the Bulgarian electorate said to have rejected it.
</P>
<P>
   Ioanna and her children were given 24 hours to leave, and they
fled to Egypt and later to Spain. Later, Ioanna moved to Portugal
to be near her exiled brother, King Umberto II of Italy. She is
survived by her son, a businessman in Madrid, and her daughter, who
lives in New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   She returned to Bulgaria in 1993 to reinter the heart of her
husband, which had been found in the garden of a royal palace. His
grave was destroyed by the Communists in 1954, but his heart had
apparently been buried separately.

 By CARLTON THOMPSON  
 c. 2000, Houston Chronicle  
KISSIMMEE, Fla. _ Ken Caminiti isn't feeling well.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sound familiar?
</P>
<P>
   Don't fret; it's just flu-like symptoms this time, which is a
far cry from the acute sinus infection that hospitalized him last
spring and got his homecoming season in Houston off to a rocky
start. Caminiti would prefer the similarities between last season
and this one end right there.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was one of the most frustrating years of my career,'' said
Caminiti, who missed 79 games because of a calf injury.
</P>
<P>
   It was so frustrating he considered retirement, a thought
teammate Jeff Bagwell found hard to believe.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where was he going to go? You can only work on so many cars,''
Bagwell joked, referring to Caminiti's hobby of restoring classic
cars.
</P>
<P>
   But Caminiti insists he was serious, and he's even more serious
when he says 2000 may be his last season in the big leagues. After
11 years of pushing his body to the limit, Caminiti sees the end
nearing, and he has no intention of tarnishing what has been a
wonderful career.
</P>
<P>
   Caminiti has seen some of his peers play past their prime and
wants to avoid that.
</P>
<P>
   He is in the final year of a two-year, $9 million contract; the
Astros hold an option for 2001 at $5.5 million. The club can buy
out the option year for $500,000. Caminiti, who turns 36 in April,
turned down a three-year, $21 million offer from Detroit to sign
with the Astros after the 1998 season.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they (the Astros) want to take care of me and pick up the
option year on my contract, I'll play (in 2001), but I'm not
begging them,'' he said. ``I'm not going to beg to get on a team
anymore. If things work out, fine; if they don't, that's fine, too.
I've already told my wife and a lot of my friends that this is
probably my last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to play anywhere else. I started my career in
Houston, and it would be nice to end it in Houston. In my mind,
this was my last contract. I'd like to play next year, I think. But
I don't know for sure.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll see how this year goes. I'm going to have a whole bunch
of fun, let my hair down and play as hard as I can play. Hopefully,
if I'm healthy, everything will work out.''
</P>
<P>
   Astros general manager Gerry Hunsicker declined to speculate on
Caminiti's future.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now I'm focused on this year and trying to win an
unprecedented fourth consecutive National League Central Division
title,'' Hunsicker said. ``Ken is a key part of our club. I'd like
to get past this season before we deal with anything else.''
</P>
<P>
   But if 2000 is as frustrating for Caminiti as 1999 was, he'll
make the decision himself.
</P>
<P>
   Injuries limited Caminiti to 78 games, but he was productive
when he played, hitting .286 with 13 home runs and 56 RBIs.
However, when you're just three years removed from a Most Valuable
Player season (1996 with San Diego), that's not enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whenever I'm not producing, and I'm getting paid, I always
feel like I'm stealing a paycheck,'' said Caminiti, who hasn't
exceeded 146 games since 1991. ``I've had a good career. I've saved
my pennies, and financially I'm OK. I'd probably go crazy without
the game, because I've never gone without it. But it's getting
close to the end of my career, and I'm trying to go out on a
positive note.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still think I'm that kind of player (that he was in 1996),
but I don't want to stay in the game longer than I should. It's up
to me to know when that is. Right now, I really believe I've still
got it; it's just a matter of finding it and staying healthy.''
</P>
<P>
   Staying healthy is a tall order for Caminiti, even during the
offseason. All he can do is laugh when the conversation shifts to
the freakish accident in which he fell out of a tree blind during a
hunting trip last fall. He cracked three bones in his back in the
fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stupid,'' Caminiti said. ``That's all that was.''
</P>
<P>
   Manager Larry Dierker cracks a smile, too. ``That's just
Cammy,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   By his own admission, Caminiti's offseason mishap sounds worse
than it was. Then again, this is a player some say has the highest
tolerance for pain in the major leagues.
</P>
<P>
   That's why Caminiti is so miffed by last season's injury, which
was first termed a calf strain. An MRI later revealed a muscle in
his calf was partially torn, rather than strained.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most frustrating part about it is that I know myself, and
I know what I can play with in terms of pain,'' he said. ``I've
played with just about everything, but I couldn't play with this. I
couldn't do anything.
</P>
<P>
   ``They said it was just a strain, and I felt (soft) for not
being able to play with that. Reflecting back on my career, the one
thing I'm most proud of is how my peers view me. They see me as a
guy who's going to play, no matter what.''
</P>
<P>
   Once healthy, Caminiti made up for lost time. He hit .322 with
seven homers and 27 RBIs over his final 28 games and was one of the
Astros' few bright spots in their Division Series loss to the
Braves.
</P>
<P>
   Caminiti hit .417 in the playoffs with three homers and eight
RBIs. The Astros scored 15 runs in the four-game series.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's probably the only reason I'm here right now,'' Caminiti
said of his strong finish. ``I thought about leaving (the game)
last year. That's how frustrated I was. I know I have a lot to
offer; it's just that injuries have slowed me down the last three
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had a good career, and I just don't want it to end in a
frustrating way. As long as I feel like I have something to offer,
I'm going to play, and right now I still feel like I can offer
something to this team.''

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Bronx district attorney, facing criticism for
failing to get a conviction of the four officers charged with
murdering Amadou Diallo, repeatedly insisted Monday that his
prosecutors had presented a strong case for conviction and implied
that the jury's decision baffled him.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I can say is these 12 people gave their best effort,''
the district attorney, Robert T. Johnson, said, ``but that doesn't
satisfy the people, the real people, the people of the entire
state, in knowing that justice worked the way it's supposed to
work.''
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference he called to address criticisms of how he
handled the case, Johnson also said the justice system broke down
when an appeals court ordered the case moved to Albany, and he
faulted the judge's instructions to the jury on how to consider the
charges.
</P>
<P>
   But seven of the jurors, in a group interview Monday on NBC's
``Today'' show, said they had no choice but to acquit based on the
law and the facts presented to them.
</P>
<P>
   One juror, Lavette Freeman, suggested that she would have
convicted if the prosecution had given her a basis for doing so.
``For me that hurts,'' Freeman, who is black, said. She added that
while she understood the anger of those protesting the verdict, ``I
have to take it back to the district attorney's office; they didn't
give me anything _ nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, addressing criticism directed against him, said: ``You
know, there have been some who said that Robert Johnson should
resign. I think somebody who policed in the way these four officers
policed that night, they should resign.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``Their mistakes, their misjudgments, their
preconceptions, led to the violent and horrible death of an
innocent person.''
</P>
<P>
   Again and again, Johnson insisted that the prosecution had
offered evidence warranting a conviction, showing that the
vestibule of the Bronx apartment building where Diallo was shot was
well lighted, that there was a pause in the police gunfire, and
that Diallo had been on the ground as most of the shots were fired.
</P>
<P>
   ``We painted the picture, and I think we painted it loud and
clear, that Amadou Diallo was prejudged,'' Johnson said. ``That
they made judgments about Amadou Diallo that were incorrect. They
made assumptions.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, speaking of the jurors, he added, ``And I don't think
anybody can say that they couldn't come to those conclusions if
they wanted to.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, he again said, ``We painted the picture. The why, that is
up to the 12 people who made the decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson suggested several times that the officers were not
entirely truthful. For example, he cited the officers' claim that
they had not moved Diallo's body after the shooting. ``You know,
there was a search for a gun,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The officers, he said, ``were testifying in front of each other
so that if they wanted to weave a case together, they could.''
</P>
<P>
   The problem his office faced, he said, was that ``basically
there are only five people who actually saw this'' _ the four
officers and Schrrie Elliott, a Bronx woman who testified for the
defense and whom Johnson implied his office did not find credible.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   He also said prosecutors did not cross-examine Dr. James J.
Fyfe, an expert on police procedures who was the defense's last
witness, because he felt Fyfe did only ``minor damage'' to the
prosecution's case. At least one juror has said she was surprised
that prosecutors did not cross-examine Fyfe.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can understand people differing with us on strategy,'' he
said, ``but please, no one underestimate the amount of commitment
we had to do justice in this particular matter.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Johnson said prosecutors did not raise the issue of race because
there was no ``overt proof'' that it motivated the officers'
actions, although, he said, ``there is very good reason to believe
that some doctor on Park Avenue would not have been shot reaching
for his wallet.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   He also answered criticism that prosecutors should have asked
the judge to instruct jurors to consider each of the shots
individually, on the grounds that perhaps the initial shots were
justified, but 41 were not. But Johnson said prosecutors did not
pursue that issue because ``every shot was unjustified.''
</P>
<P>
   Of Justice Joseph C. Teresi, Johnson said only that prosecutors
had objected to the judge allowing the officers to claim three
separate kinds of legal justification for the shooting, two of
which presumed that Diallo was committing a crime, and Johnson
reiterated that there was no evidence of that. He also said he
objected to the judge re-reading to the jury each of the three
kinds of justification six times _ after each count.
</P>
<P>
   But he also said the way the judge charged the jury reflected
the way the criminal justice system protects defendants, and he
reminded people angry about the verdict that the system similarly
protects average defendants in the Bronx.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Johnson said reports that the judge visited defense lawyers at
their bed-and-breakfast after the trial, if true, were ``extremely
disturbing, because that kind of action can destroy confidence in
the people and the system.''
</P>
<P>
   The district attorney reserved his harshest criticism for an
appellate division's decision to move the trial to Albany from the
Bronx. Calling the change of venue ``horribly wrong,'' he said, ``I
think it is going to go down in history as one of the greatest
assaults on confidence in the criminal justice system.''
</P>
<P>
   Some community leaders and elected officials have been rallying
to Johnson's defense. The Rev. Roger Hambrick said the Bronx Clergy
Task Force was going to meet with Johnson to hear his assessment of
the case. ``It's easy to point fingers now,'' he said. ``But
listen, we all knew it was going to be a very difficult task for
him to win up there.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Fernando Ferrer, the Bronx borough president, agreed, saying
that while a dialogue was useful, Johnson should not resign.
</P>
<P>
   As he did after the officers' arraignment 11 months ago,
Johnson, who is black, addressed the larger discussion about police
conduct and procedures that the Diallo case has raised.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been in the Bronx since I was 16; I have a 19-year-old
son who lives here,'' he said. ``I know that when I get stopped,
and I have a couple of times, I have to say my license is in my
back pocket; the registration is in the glove compartment. That
kind of fear that some people have has to be addressed. And even if
it's not a policy thing, it's an attitudinal thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your mind,'' he said, ``must be open to innocent
interpretations of people's conduct.''

 WASHINGTON: times larger.   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The speech, to the Federal Bar Association, an organization of
lawyers who practice before federal agencies, was to have been
delivered by an aide. But Summers decided to deliver it personally.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month an article in The New York Times reported
that the tax burden on individuals rose in recent years while the
burden on companies fell, and a major reason cited was the
proliferation of tax shelters. The article included IRS data
showing that had companies paid taxes in 1997 at the same rate as
in 1990, they would have paid $60 billion more in 1997 alone, while
if individuals had paid in 1997 at the same rate as in 1990, they
would have paid $80 billion less.
</P>
<P>
   Summers began his address by declaring that ``our aim is to curb
illegitimate tax avoidance.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``We have no quarrel with the natural desire of
companies and individuals to minimize their tax burden by
legitimate means.''
</P>
<P>
   He quoted Judge Learned Hand's observation: ``There is nothing
sinister in arranging one's affairs to keep taxes as low as
possible. Everybody does so.'' Summers said he agreed with that as
a matter of both law and morality, but added that ``we must draw
the line at the pursuit of engineered transactions that are devoid
of economic substance.''
</P>
<P>
   Summers also renewed a call for Congress to pass legislation to
help deter abusive shelters, including a 25 percent excise tax on
fees collected by firms arranging such shelters and a doubling, to
40 percent from 20 percent, of the penalty on taxes improperly
avoided.
</P>
<P>
   He also repeated his call for Congress to enact the ``doctrine
of economic substance.'' That doctrine, created by judges in tax
cases, holds that transactions whose primary benefit is tax
avoidance are not legitimate. Summers said enacting that doctrine
would help ``fight abusive tax shelters on a universal rather than
case-by-case basis.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Bill Archer, R-Texas, who chairs the House Ways and Means
Committee, criticized Treasury for not issuing regulations sooner,
noting that Congress passed an abusive-tax-shelter law three years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must stop abuses and shut down illegal tax shelters,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   But Tara Bradshaw, a spokeswoman for Sen. William V. Roth Jr.,
R- Del., who chairs the Senate Finance Committee, said the senator
would not comment on the proposals until he had studied them. She
said the committee would hold hearings within a month on corporate
tax shelters.
</P>
<P>
   Charles O. Rossotti, the IRS commissioner, said that early
disclosure of tax shelters ``will give us better information to
focus our resources'' and will speed up ``a pretty slow and
indirect process'' of hunting for abusive shelters one at a time.
</P>
<P>
   The requirement that tax shelter promoters keep lists of clients
will allow the IRS, when it finds one tax shelter, to identify all
such shelters.
</P>
<P>
   Summers' call to crack down on illegal tax shelters was praised
by Mike Murphy, executive director of the Tax Executives Institute,
which represents top tax officials at 2,800 companies. But Murphy
said the institute does not agree with each of the techniques
Treasury proposed. For example, Murphy said that doubling the
penalty for abusive shelters may not be effective and may result in
more litigation.
</P>
<P>
   Some institute members, Murphy said, are eager for the
government to attack abusive shelters because they are feeling
pressure from their superiors to match the tax-avoidance strategies
of competitors, even if they must engage in shams.
</P>
<P>
   Summers noted that while individual income tax revenues surged
6.2 percent last year, corporate income tax payments fell 2
percent.
</P>
<P>
   He said that Treasury was also considering allowing companies to
notify the IRS in advance of tax-avoidance transactions and to
obtain a ruling on their validity.

ON EVE OF PRIMARY, BRADLEY MAKES FINAL PITCH IN SEATTLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOEL CONNELLY  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ The tall, serious man buttoned the top of his
raincoat, and stepped out of the University of Washington
administration building to the cheers of a rally that may have
marked the validictory of his campaign for president of the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Bradley put on his cheerful campaign face for the boistrous
crowd. On a blustery day, about 2,000 students showed up to cheer
the former New Jersey senator who has bet the future of his
Democratic insurgency on a strong showing in Tuesday's Washington
primary.
</P>
<P>
   ``People say we're behind, but (those) people aren't here,''
Bradley told the crowd. ``They don't feel your energy. They don't
feel your idealism.''
</P>
<P>
   But even a day after his front-running opponent for the
Democratic presidential nomination, Vice President Al Gore, had
left town, Gore was still able to make news in the state.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's campaign reported Monday that he had successfully stared
down an insurance company during his visit to Seattle the previous
day.
</P>
<P>
   Aetna U.S. Healthcare said it would continue nursing coverage
for a severely ill six-month-old Everett boy whose parents met with
Gore at Franklin High School. The company had informed Dylan and
Christine Malone that nursing care would end on March 18.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't cut off this child's coverage!'' Gore shouted to a rally
after the meeting. As a result of birth injuries, Ian cannot
swallow and deep sunctioning of his nose and throat is required to
keep him alive.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would like to make it clear that Aetna U.S. Healthcare will
not cut off any of the coverage that we put in place for this
child,'' Dr. Arthur Leibowitz, chief medical officer of Aetna U.S.
Healthcare, said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have reviewed this case thoroughly and have determined that
continued coverage is in the best interests of the child. As a
pediatrician, I empathize with this family and believe we've made
the right decision,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Gore called Aetna to thank the company, then put out the news.
</P>
<P>
   ``This case shows why we need a real patient's bill of rights,
so that the voices of all families like the Malones will be
heard,'' Gore said in a statement. ``Families need to know they
have somewhere to turn when they are denied health care.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley has staked the future of his campaign on Tuesday's vote,
seeing the Democrats' beauty contest primary as a way to regain
momentum lost as media coverage has focused on Republicans John
McCain and George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley has often seemed to be trying to run for president
without raising his voice. Monday, before one of his campaign's
best crowds, he spoke in a shout. The wheezy public address system
carried his message of populism to all corners of the university
square.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic Party can be ``a protector of established
interests,'' Bradley intoned, alluding to a Gore nomination, or it
can ``once again resume its role in campaigning against
selfishness, complacency and indifference.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the past 10 days, Bradley has given the state its closest,
most extended look at a candidate for president.
</P>
<P>
   While describing Gore as a ``conservative Democrat'' from his
days in Congress, Bradley has laid out a liberal reformist agenda.
He has called for federal programs ranging from registration of all
handguns, to scholarship and loan forgiveness to draw talented
young people into the teaching profession.
</P>
<P>
   His delivery has varied with his mood. At an NAACP dinner on
Saturday, in a half-filled Westin Hotel dining room, Bradley
appeared listless, and failed to mention the host organization.
Other times, including a Friday speech in Bellingham and Sunday at
the First A.M.E. Church, he has spoken intensely and effectively.
</P>
<P>
   Gore ignored Bradley's challenge for months last year. No more.
He has twice roared into the state for arm-waving speeches
extolling economic successes of the Clinton-Gore administration.
The vice president has echoed a classic message pioneered by
Franklin D. Roosevelt: Don't change horses in mid-stream.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a chance to keep the prosperity going, but I want to
go beyond that,'' he said Sunday. ``I don't want to see anybody in
America left behind.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore has chosen to ignore darker parts of the administration
record, such as its fund-raising excesses of 1996 and his visit to
a fund-raiser held at a Buddhist temple in California.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have worked for campaign finance reform for more than 20
years, before any of the other candidates in this race,'' he said
in a Sunday interview. ``I have co-sponsored more than a dozen
pieces of legislation. I support more sweeping provisions than the
others.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley has tried to establish a gap between what Gore promises
and his performance, and between his past actions and present
stands.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you look at Al Gore in the past and Al Gore in the
present, it is hard to know where his convictions lie,'' Bradley
said at a previous University of Washington appearance.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has mocked his foe. On Saturday, the vice president quoted
criticism from the Christian Coalition. ``One critic attacks me as
too conservative, and the Christian Coalition attacks me as too
liberal. We must be doing something right,'' Gore shouted to an
appreciative audience.
</P>
<P>
   The Gore campaign copied its candidate's in-your-face strategy
for defending against the former New York Knicks forward.
</P>
<P>
   It has trotted out interests groups at every turn, and used
liberal icons like ex-Gov. Mike Lowry to counter Bradley's attempt
to argue that Gore was ``much more conservative than people know''
in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley hit hard Gore's votes to restrict federal funding of
abortions while a House member in the late 1970s. On Sunday, Gore's
campaign responded by trotting out the state director of the
National Abortion Rights Action League to stand on the stage and
read an endorsement resolution.
</P>

   Bradley went after Gore on the environment, citing his less than

SPORTS COLUMN: FOR THE GOOD OF THE GAME 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also BBO-YANKS-STRAWBERRY)

 By HARVEY ARATON    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   As a caring American and concerned parent, I was relieved to
know that Major League Baseball was right on top of the scourge
that is Darryl Strawberry's sickness or stupidity, depending on
one's chosen level of compassion, or understanding.
</P>
<P>
   For me, the most sensible take on this debate from any
enlightened source has always been John Lucas'. On the likes of
Strawberry, pro basketball's addict-cum-counselor/coach long
maintained that the man doesn't have a drug problem as much as he
has a ``living problem.''
</P>
<P>
   We all do, to some extent. Most sportswriters I know stress out
on deadline by ingesting serious quantities of cholesterol,
caffeine or nicotine, and afterward, wish they hadn't. In those
moments when Strawberry has sought escape from whatever haunts his
sense of self-esteem, preservation and respect, he apparently
resorted to the demon powder, and afterward, has been painfully
sorry he did.
</P>
<P>
   You can smartly argue that enough apologies were accepted,
though it is useful to remember that the more moral among us were
voicing objections before he ever played a game for the Yankees.
Lucas has often said that it is easy to call for one's banishment
until it is your loved one.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees, who embraced Strawberry as their prodigal child,
were convincing when they said they cared about him more than they
needed him, because, the truth was, they didn't.
</P>
<P>
   In weighing his decision to ban Strawberry for one year with no
time off for good behavior, it seems that the commissioner, Bud
Selig, heard the pious news media more than the pleas of Joe Torre
and David Cone.
</P>
<P>
   ``A painful decision for me to make,'' Selig concluded Monday.
``In the end, I could not ignore Darryl's past infractions and
concluded that each of us must be held accountable for his or her
actions.''
</P>
<P>
   Too bad. I kind of liked having Strawberry around as an example
of the damage and waste drugs can bring. The suspension could mean
the last of Strawberry, while only proving that Selig can knock a
60-mile-an-hour fastball out of the park, or a pimple off
baseball's face.
</P>
<P>
   And while it took him less than a week to cut on Strawberry,
Selig is deep into his second year on a more vexing problem,
enhancement compounds, the snappy curve ball he has been looking at
for nothing but strikes.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, a study commissioned by baseball resulted in
the report that revealed that moderate amounts of androstenedione
taken over seven days increased testosterone levels in men. If you
missed this important story, it was, in part, because baseball
released it with a successful and self-serving spin.
</P>
<P>
   In a joint statement, the commissioner's office and the players
association agreed (now there is a statement in itself) that the
study offered no evidence to support the contention that ``the
levels of testosterone were sufficient to produce enhanced
performance.''
</P>
<P>
   What wasn't said was that the scientists were never commissioned
or financed to extend the study that far. In the interests of
protecting Mark McGwire's home run record, baseball proudly
announced that it had proved its case by doing nothing.
</P>
<P>
   That not half the stink was raised over scientific proof that
andro changes blood levels and poses long-term health risks as
there has been over one man's relapse told Don Gatlin that ``either
the public hasn't figured out what's going on or it doesn't care
that so many athletes are on performance-enhancement drugs.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, athletes (Tom Gugliotta of the Phoenix Suns, to name
one) and, more frighteningly, young wannabes everywhere continue
taking over-the-counter substances about which they have not a
clue.
</P>
<P>
   Gatlin, director of the Olympic Analytical Laboratory at UCLA,
was one of the secondary collaborators in the baseball study, led
by Dr. Benjamin Leder and Dr. Joel Finkelstein of the Massachusetts
General Hospital. While more cautious than Gatlin in advising
people against the use of andro, Finkelstein agreed Monday that
this is a ``serious public health issue, beyond being a sports
issue.''
</P>
<P>
   McGwire said last season that he had ceased using andro, but
didn't denounce the product and baseball didn't ban it and now is
merely supporting more federally financed research that Gatlin said
will take ``three or four years.''
</P>
<P>
   Darryl Strawberry, who could've been McGwire, will be a memory
by the time baseball has to admit it was years behind other sports
on this issue. Some day, baseball may even have to put an asterisk
next to McGwire's name in the record book. In the meantime, the
improvident Strawberry has been sent away, perhaps forever, for the
good of the game, and as an example for the country's imitative
youth.

FOILED TERROR PLOT LINKED TO BIN LADEN AIDE  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By JAMES RISEN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Middle Eastern and American officials say they
believe that a key lieutenant of Osama bin Laden, the Saudi exile,
coordinated a terrorist plot that targeted Western and Israeli
tourists in Jordan in December.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said the man played a critical role in directing the
operation from Pakistan, and fled to Afghanistan a day or two after
Jordanian authorities foiled the plot and arrested 13 people.
</P>
<P>
   American and Middle Eastern investigators say they believe that
the suspect, Abu Zubaydah, was also in contact with Algerians who
have been charged in a separate attempt to bomb unspecified targets
in the United States in December. It is not clear whether Zubaydah
played an active role in that plot, these officials say.
</P>
<P>
   But they say that the emerging evidence about Zubaydah provides
an important development in their effort to establish that bin
Laden is a commanding figure in terrorist plots against the West.
</P>
<P>
   These investigators say they believe that bin Laden and his
group were trying to land two blows at once against Western
interests. These attacks, they say, would have been their first
large terrorist actions since the 1998 bombings of two American
embassies in East Africa, for which bin Laden has been indicted.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators began working on the theory that bin Laden was
behind the alleged plots as soon as arrests were made in Jordan and
the United States. They quickly discovered that some of those
people held in Jordan had been trained in camps operated in
Afghanistan by the Saudi exile. They also found that the Algerians
in Canada had taken direction from a Mauritanian man related by
marriage to bin Laden.
</P>
<P>
   But investigators said the role of Zubaydah, from the Gaza
Strip, is the most significant evidence to date that bin laden was
directly behind the two operations. Zubaydah is a trusted member of
bin Laden's inner circle, they said.
</P>
<P>
   Middle Eastern intelligence officials describe Zubaydah as the
coordinator of bin Laden's ``external operations,'' which they
describe as the group's terrorist activities outside Afghanistan.
Bin Laden has been using Afghanistan as his base and as a haven
from international efforts to bring him to court.
</P>
<P>
   Operating from Peshawar, Pakistan, Zubaydah was in charge of
communications between bin Laden's organization in Afghanistan and
terrorist cells around the world, investigators now suspect.
</P>
<P>
   Officials say that bin Laden's organization employs stringent
security measures, and that sensitive information about its
operations is closely held by an inner circle of trusted aides. As
a result, rank-and-file members can betray few details if they are
arrested.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Zubaydah's role fits a pattern that investigators say they
recognize, particularly in the bombings in Kenya and Tanzania in
1998. Middle Eastern intelligence officials say they believe that
an Egyptian radical and bin Laden lieutenant, named Mohammed Atef,
helped coordinate the embassy attacks. They say he was in contact
with the cells in Kenya and Tanzania that carried out the
operations.
</P>
<P>
   Atef is thought to have disappeared into Afghanistan after the
embassy bombings.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Middle Eastern intelligence officials say that Zubaydah
took Atef's place, just in time for the plots of last December.
</P>
<P>
   Both operations failed after members of both cells were
arrested.
</P>
<P>
   On Dec. 15, the Jordanian authorities said they had arrested 13
members of a group planning attacks against an American hotel and
three tourist sites frequented by Israelis and Westerners. Jordan
may have been targeted because it is a pro-Western neighbor of
Israel but terrorists might also have seen it as easier to
infiltrate than Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Jordanian officials said they had evidence that the suspects
received terrorist training in Afghanistan and were tied to the bin
Laden network.
</P>
<P>
   The Jordanian authorities have concluded that a total of 28
individuals were involved in the plot, including some who remained
in Afghanistan after the arrests in Jordan.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, a separate plot was unraveling along the
U.S.-Canadian border. On Dec. 14, authorities arrested an Algerian
named Ahmed Ressam, whose car contained a military explosive and
homemade detonators.
</P>
<P>
   Canadian authorities say Ressam, known by the nom de guerre Abu
Reda, had received military training at camps in Afghanistan and
Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
   Ressam's arrest has prompted an investigation by the American
and Canadian authorities to determine whether the group was
planning an attack in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Federal prosecutors have so far charged four Algerians with
taking part in the plot. While U.S. officials have speculated that
the Canadian case is connected to bin Laden, they have publicly
offered few specifics to support that linkage.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The new information about Zubaydah is helping the authorities to
see a clearer picture.
</P>
<P>
   Zubaydah is the alias of Mohammed Hussein Zein-al-Abideen. Born
in 1973, he went to Afghanistan as a teenager, where he reportedly
linked up with bin Laden.
</P>
<P>
   From Peshawar, on the Pakistani-Afghan border, Zubaydah has
played a critical role in the development of bin Laden's
international networks in the last two years, officials say.
</P>
<P>
   In Pakistan, they say, Zubaydah acted as gatekeeper for the
Afghan training camps operated by bin Laden and his militant
allies. Intelligence officials have been told that leaders of local
cells around the world would contact him to request training in
Afghanistan for members of their cells. The cell members would then
travel to Peshawar and meet Zubaydah, who would then decide whether
they would be given training and in which camps, according to these
reports.
</P>
<P>
   Among the cell leaders with whom he was in direct contact was
Khader Abu Hosher, the leader of the plot to attack four tourist
sites in Jordan during millennium celebrations, according to Middle
Eastern intelligence officials. Zubaydah told Hosher which sites
were to be picked for attack, Middle Eastern intelligence officials
have learned.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, officials have discovered that Zubaydah had a joint
bank account in Peshawar with Khalil Deek. He is a naturalized
American citizen of Palestinian descent who has been jailed in
Jordan in connection with the millennium plot there. The bank
account contained between $1,860 and $3,100, officials said. Deek,
who is now in jail in Jordan, is charged with having played a role
in arranging the travel between Afghanistan and Jordan for those
involved in the Jordan plot.
</P>
<P>
   The authorities say Zubaydah was also in contact with Ressam and
his group in Canada.
</P>
<P>
   The ties between Zubaydah and the Canadian group seem less
clearly understood than are his links to the Jordan cell. But one
connection between Zubaydah and the Ressam group apparently went
through an Algerian in Canada named Fateh Kamel, some Western
intelligence officials state.
</P>
<P>
   Kamel, who had ties to Ressam's group, also had ties to a group
of militant Islamic veterans of the Afghan war who are now in
Bosnia. In turn, that group was in contact with Zubaydah, according
to a European intelligence official.
</P>
<P>
   Another link found between bin Laden's organization and the
Canadian group was through a man named Mohambedou Ould Slahi, a
Mauritanian who lived for a time in Montreal, where he met
frequently with Mokhtar Haouri, an Algerian charged with directing
Ressam in the bomb plot.
</P>
<P>
   Ould Slahi's brother-in-law is a close associate of bin Laden.
In addition, Ould Slahi has been in frequent contact with the
representatives of a construction company in Sudan owned by bin
Laden; investigators have concluded that the company served as a
front for bin Laden's terror network. Ould Slahi was arrested in
Mauritania last month, but has since been released.
</P>
<P>
   American and Middle Eastern intelligence officials are more
certain of the links between the Jordan plot and bin Laden. Hosher
was a veteran of the Afghan war who later became a member of Jaish
Mohammed, or Mohammed's Army, a radical Islamic group that mounted
terrorist acts in Jordan in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   After his release from prison in Jordan in 1993, he moved to
Yemen, where he came in contact with members of Egyptian Islamic
Jihad, a radical group now allied with bin Laden.
</P>
<P>
   Hosher's assistant in the Jordan plot was Raed Hejazi, who
traveled on an American passport and worked for a time as a taxi
drive in Boston. Hosher is now in jail in Jordan, and Hejazi is at
large.
</P>
<P>
   Planning for the Jordan operation began in 1998, officials have
learned. That would suggest that bin Laden's organization may have
begun plotting soon after the African embassy bombings in August
1998.
</P>
<P>
   Hosher sent some members of his group for training in
Afghanistan in 1999, officials said. Cell members were then given
false passports and traveled individually along a circuitous route
from Afghanistan, to Yemen, Syria and then Jordan, officials have
concluded.
</P>
<P>
   Like the cell in Canada, the group in Jordan appears to have had
links to terrorists in Algeria.
</P>
<P>
   Jordanian officials found that a man living in Britain named
Omar Abu Omar, also known as Abu Kutada, played a role in backing
the Jordanian cell. Britain has rejected Jordan's requests to
extradite him.

ORACLE WILL CREATE ONLINE MARKETPLACE FOR SEARS AND CARREFOUR  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Calif., France)  By LAWRENCE M. FISHER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The Oracle Corp. said Monday that it will join
with Sears, Roebuck and Co. and Carrefour of France to create a
global online marketplace for the retail industry.
</P>
<P>
   Other retailers will be invited to join the founding partners in
the new venture, which will be called GlobalNetXchange. The joint
venture initially will focus on the combined $80 billion in
purchases that Sears and Carrefour make from 50,000 suppliers,
partners and distributors.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement follows Oracle's creation of a similar exchange
for automakers, initially with Ford, but recently joined by General
Motors and Daimler-Chrysler. Such Web-based purchasing systems are
expected to trim costs and speed the purchasing process for many
different industries.
</P>
<P>
   Oracle shares closed Monday at $68.625, down $2, on Nasdaq.
Sears closed at $27.3125, up $1.4375, on the New York Stock
Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said Oracle is moving aggressively to lock up whole
industry categories in the hot business-to-business electronic
commerce market, known as B2B. But some said Monday's announcement
was less significant than the automotive venture, and questioned
whether other retailers would even be willing to turn over
purchasing to a collective that includes competitors.
</P>
<P>
   For retailers, purchasing ``is very strategic in nature,'' said
Richard Church, an analyst with Solomon Smith Barney. ``There
aren't many industries where procurement costs are a higher
percentage of sales than in retail. I'm not sure Wal-Mart is going
to be willing to participate in what is essentially a purchasing
cooperative,'' he said. ``But maybe it can be successful by
bringing in smaller retailers,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Sears and Carrefour initially will share the majority interest
in GlobalNetXchange, while Oracle will hold a minority interest and
will provide software, implementation and support. Using Oracle
Exchange, Oracle's online purchasing software, the new company is
expected to become operational within 30 days with its own
management, employees and capitalization. Sears and Carrefour
indicated they may begin doing buyers' auctions on the site within
two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a revolution in retail,'' Arthur C. Martinez, Sears
chairman and chief executive, said in a conference call. ``It will
forever redefine supply-chain processes, increase collaboration
with suppliers and reduce supply-chain costs,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Many retailers already do much of their purchasing
electronically, using so-called electronic data interchange
networks. But such programs are proprietary in nature, meaning that
one maker's program cannot interact with another, so a company must
get all of its suppliers to sign on or the system does not work. In
contrast, Web-based exchanges are accessible to anyone with a
standard browser and require no specialized software or hardware
for buyers or sellers.
</P>
<P>
   Coming close on the heels of the auto announcement, the retail
venture illustrates Oracle's strategy in the business-to-business
market. Although Oracle operates a general purpose procurement
service called Oracle Exchange, with more than 1,000 suppliers
selling all kinds of products, the company's main thrust will
increasingly be in specialized offerings for so-called vertical
markets, like automobiles, retail, or healthcare.
</P>
<P>
   ``What these verticals do is allow us to differentiate our
services much more,'' said Ray Lane, Oracle's president and chief
operating officer, in a telephone interview.
</P>
<P>
   By partnering with the major players in an industry, ``we can do
direct procurement,'' rather than serving as a middleman. ``That
differentiates us from Ariba or CommerceOne, which do only
indirect,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But analysts said that Ariba and CommerceOne are moving toward
the kind of vertical strategy pursued by Oracle. Chemdex, an early
B2B player specializing in research materials for drug companies,
last week announced the formation of Ventro, a parent company that
will create a series of vertical market partnerships.
</P>
<P>
   ``A growing number of platform players, whether Oracle,
CommerceOne, Ariba or Ventro, are all going to be chasing very
large companies to partner with to take over a very significant
piece of an industry's purchasing,'' said Bruce Temkin, an analyst
with Forrester Research.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oracle has some inherent advantage here because they are a
software company, and they are installed at most of the large
companies with which they want to get involved in this area,''
Temkin said. ``On the flip side, their architecture was built from
this from the ground up, like a CommerceOne or a Ventro. They have
to make it work, and they have to prove they have a market-making
platform,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Breyer, managing partner of Accel Partners, a venture
capital firm based in Palo Alto, Calif., that helped form
Walmart.com, said Oracle, Sears and Carrefour had not made a
convincing case for other retailers to join them.
</P>
<P>
   ``The flaw is really about corporate governance,'' he said. ``It
is unclear who is calling the shots. Is the goal to build a world
class independent marketplace or to build a business that will be
complimentary to the partners who have built the consortium?''

ADVERTISING: A FORD CAMPAIGN WILL COMBINE TV AND ONLINE MEDIA 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By STUART ELLIOTT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ford is overhauling a highly visible element of a big campaign
for an important new car line as the company seeks to become part
of a hot trend: transforming television advertising into a hybrid
of the TV and online media that could be called dot-commercials.
</P>
<P>
   Ford and a longtime agency, J. Walter Thompson, plan to
introduce next month a series of live commercials for Focus, the
new line of ``entry level'' compact cars aimed at younger drivers,
with interactivity as a core element. The spots are intended to
work with a Web site, www.focus247.com, so that viewers can help
determine what their content will be.
</P>
<P>
   The dot-commercials come after a skein of live Focus spots that
Ford ran last fall, which were widely deemed to have fallen short
in several crucial creative and production aspects. For one thing,
many of them were so stilted that they seemed taped rather than
live.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had wanted it to be a little more spontaneous,'' Jan Klug,
marketing communications manager at the Ford division of Ford Motor
Co. said in a telephone interview Monday from Dearborn, Mich. ``The
spots were a little too scripted and a little too clean.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The fall helped us learn what we needed to know about exciting
live advertising,'' she added. ``I think we're going to have a lot
more fun.''
</P>
<P>
   Ford is not alone in making significant changes to high-profile
ads as they continue to be presented to consumers. Perhaps the most
notable current example of such a ``midcourse correction'' is a
revamped campaign for United Airlines, part of UAL Corp., by Fallon
McElligott in Minneapolis, a unit of Publicis SA, which scrapped an
unconventional theme, ``Rising,'' for a more traditional approach.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't look at this as `Live II,' but as a way of making
true interactive television,'' said Bruce Rooke, executive vice
president and executive creative director for the Ford domestic
business at the Detroit office of Thompson, part of the WPP Group.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rather than have people sitting passively at their sets,
watching for mistakes,'' he added, referring to the vagaries of
producing live commercials, ``we want them to get involved, control
the way the spots go forward, tell us what the scripts ought to
be.''
</P>
<P>
   Ford is also not alone in bringing out dot-commercials, which
are indicative of the growing interest among marketers and media
companies in capitalizing on the migration of consumers to the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, Nike Inc. has already been running a series of
television commercials for the Air Cross Trainer II shoe, created
by Wieden &AMP; Kennedy in Portland, Ore., that invite viewers to a Web
site (www.whatever.nike.com) to view alternate endings for the
spots.
</P>
<P>
   The Pizza Hut unit of Tricon Global Restaurants is sponsoring a
promotion with CDnow.com that offers customers the chance to order
free customized compact discs from the CDnow Web site. And the NBC
unit of General Electric Co. is promoting a Web site,
www.JustJack.com, devoted to a character from the sitcom ``Will and
Grace.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Interactive spots make sense for Focus because the line is aimed
at drivers under the age of 35, Rooke said, ``people who love
getting product information off the Web.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If we can drive them to the site and keep them there in an
interesting way,'' he added, ``instead of just running a spot
showing a Web address under the logo and hoping people will go
there, Focus will benefit.''
</P>
<P>
   Ford and Thompson have scheduled four dot-commercials during
each of these four nights: March 8, March 15, March 23 and April 5.
They will run during prime-time series on ABC, a unit of Walt
Disney Co., like ``The Drew Carey Show,'' ``The Norm Show,''
``20/20,'' ``Two Guys and a Girl'' and ``Who Wants to Be a
Millionaire.''
</P>
<P>
   The idea is for viewers to shape the spots by voting on the
Focus Web site, making content decisions like which of five cast
members will appear on screen, what they will wear and whether they
will pitch the Focus coupe, sedan or station wagon.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can end the first spot with a question like `What should
this person say?''' Klug explained, ``and then we'll take the best
line viewers suggest and say it in the next spot.''
</P>
<P>
   The five cast members, who were described by Klug as unknown
actors, will replace Annabelle Gurwitch, a 30-something television
personality from the TBS Superstation cable network, who was the
spokeswoman in the live spots last fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll get more flexibility, more reality, with more people,''
Klug said, adding: ``Annabelle was terrific for what we needed her
for, but didn't ring as true with the target audience as we'd
wanted. Part of it was our fault; we were loading her lips with
things people don't normally say, to make sure we got in all the
product mentions.''
</P>
<P>
   For viewers not thrilled at the prospect of becoming
dot-commercial contributors, Julie Roehm, the Focus brand manager
said, there will be more tangible incentives to participate: more
than 500 prizes worth $100,000 offered in a ``co-branding
partnership'' with Sony, including ``a Sony Limited Edition
Focus.'' People can win the prizes by accumulating points for
visiting and voting on the Web site.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign will be promoted with print ads in newspapers and
magazines as well as banner ads appearing on Web sites operated by
Ford's Internet partners, which include Bolt, DEN, iVillage and
Yahoo.

MARKETPLACE: A CLOSER LOOK AT CYBERSHOP.COM 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk)

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In searching for winners in the electronic retailing business,
profits are hard to find. So investors have focused on revenue,
figuring that rising sales are a sign of success.
</P>
<P>
   So it was no surprise that the stock price of Cybershop.com
lifted off after it reported that its sales soared 458 percent in
the third quarter from the comparable period a year earlier. The
stock, around $6 a share before the announcement, climbed to a high
of $14.25 on Nov. 29 amid great optimism over the holiday shopping
season.
</P>
<P>
   That zooming revenue figure, however, may have concealed more
than it revealed. Sales of Cybershop.com, the basic venture,
actually declined 28 percent from a year earlier. But that fact was
disclosed only months later, long after some insiders had sold
shares. The company's reported revenue increase in the quarter came
from an acquisition and from a joint venture that was facing
problems caused by a change of strategy by the venture partner,
Tops Appliance City, which has since filed for bankruptcy
protection.
</P>
<P>
   A year-over-year decline in quarterly revenue for an Internet
retailing venture was almost unheard of in 1999, as Internet
shopping grew rapidly, and a report of such a fall in its basic
business might have caused the company's stock price to fall. But
the sales decline was not disclosed in the quarterly report filed
by Cybershop.com on Nov. 12, nor was it mentioned in the company's
news release.
</P>
<P>
   With the stock price rising in November, in the absence of
public knowledge of the falling revenue at the company's flagship
operation, insiders led by the company's chairman and chief
executive, Jeffrey Tauber, sold $7.9 million worth of stock, at
prices ranging from $10 to $14 a share, with most of the money
going to Tauber and his family.
</P>
<P>
   After that run-up, the stock's price spent most of December
slowly declining as investors were informed that the insiders had
sold. But it was not until last Thursday that the company, in an
amended quarterly report to the Securities and Exchange Commission,
disclosed that revenue of its flagship business fell in the third
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Tauber did not return a phone call seeking comment Monday, nor
did any other officer of the company. In Nasdaq trading Monday, the
stock closed at $4.875, less than half the price received by
insiders in November.
</P>
<P>
   Cybershop.com has since decided to close its original Internet
site and largely to abandon the retailing business, instead
becoming an ``Internet incubator'' that will identify and invest in
promising Internet start-ups.
</P>
<P>
   It is still not clear just how well Cybershop.com did in the
final quarter of last year, although figures for that period are
scheduled to be released Tuesday after being delayed. Investors in
the company could be pardoned if they are more than a little
confused.
</P>
<P>
   On Feb. 1, the company _ describing itself as ``the leading
online off-price retailer of designer apparel, home furnishings and
electronics,'' reported revenue of $4.2 million for the final
quarter of 1999 and quoted Tauber as saying he was ``very pleased
with our financial performance.''
</P>
<P>
   The release said gross margins _ the difference between what the
company paid for inventory and what it realized when it sold the
goods _ was 32 percent, ``among the highest of any publicly traded
e-tailers.''
</P>
<P>
   It added that detailed financial results would be released on
Feb. 14.
</P>
<P>
   On Feb. 10, the company said that it was closing its main
electronic retailing operation and beginning Grove Street Ventures,
a company that is to be an Internet incubator. It did not explain
why the pleasing financial results announced only nine days earlier
were not enough to justify a continuance of that operation.
</P>
<P>
   When Feb. 14 rolled around, the company announced that its
release of financial information had been indefinitely delayed
because ``additional time will be required in order to properly
analyze events occurring after the company's Dec. 31, 1999,
year-end, which could impact the final audited results for 1999.''
</P>
<P>
   Last Thursday, the same day it filed the amended quarterly
report, the company said that 1999 figures would be released at 4
p.m. Tuesday, to be followed by a conference call at 4:30 p.m.

STOCKS REBOUND, BUT INTEREST-RATE FEARS REMAIN 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Changes ``co-chairman'' to ``co-chief executive'' in graf
that begins ``Citigroup ...'') 
(lb) 
 By KENNETH N. GILPIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Dow Jones industrial average rebounded above
10,000 on Monday as investors, at least temporarily, moved back
into blue-chip stocks that had been battered in recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index also gained ground, helped
in part by the Goldman Sachs market strategist Abby Joseph Cohen,
who said Monday that the slide in the index had left it
undervalued.
</P>
<P>
   But technology stocks, which have continued to rise in the face
of a broad-based decline this year, edged lower Monday.
</P>
<P>
   With the economy continuing to power ahead and the Federal
Reserve Board showing no sign that it has finished trying to slow
it down by raising short-term interest rates, most analysts and
traders said Monday's moves were little more than a temporary
bounce from what had been a sharp sell-off.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am happy the market is up, but it would be nice if I had
some reason to think it is sustainable,'' said Henry Herrmann,
chief investment officer at Waddell &AMP; Reed, a firm in Overland
Park, Kan., that has $40 billion under management. ``We are due for
a bounce, and we are getting it.''
</P>
<P>
   Led by financial and retail stocks like Citigroup, American
Express and Procter &AMP; Gamble, the Dow rose 176.53 points, or 1.8
percent, to 10,038.65. It was the biggest point gain in the Dow in
nearly two weeks and came after a 2.3 percent decline on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the S&AMP;P 500 gained 14.69 points, or 1.1 percent, to
1,348.05. Exxon Mobil, Qualcomm and American International Group
helped to lift the index.
</P>
<P>
   But investors took some profits in technology stocks. By the
close, the Nasdaq composite index was down 12.65 points, or 0.3
percent, to 4,577.85. At one point in the session, the index had
fallen as much as 2.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Prices of small-company shares were little changed. The Russell
2000 index gained 0.94, or 0.2 percent, to 557.68.
</P>
<P>
   In her comments Monday, Cohen said the recent slide in the S&AMP;P
500 had left the index about 5 percent undervalued. She maintained
her target of 1,525 for the S&AMP;P 500 by the end of the year because
of continued vigor in the economy and robust corporate profits.
</P>
<P>
   In reference to interest-rate fears, Cohen said recent and
expected interest-rate increases by the Fed are aimed ``at slowing
and elongating, not stopping, economic growth.''
</P>
<P>
   Andrew M. Brooks, head of equity trading at T. Rowe Price
Associates, said, ``Abby's mildly positive comments were a help.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Brooks said Monday's move was mostly ``a snap back from a
pretty ugly week.''
</P>
<P>
   Volume was heavy, but not frantic. On the New York Stock
Exchange, just over a billion shares changed hands. Volume on the
Nasdaq stock market was 1.78 billion shares.
</P>
<P>
   Financial stocks, which have been severely battered as interest
rates have risen, did better Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Citigroup, a Dow component, gained 1 3/8, to 49 3/8, after the
United States' biggest financial services company said John S.
Reed, its co-chief executive, would retire in April.
</P>
<P>
   Chase Manhattan gained 2 1/16, to 77 15/16. Wells Fargo rose 1
7/16, to 34 1/8. Mellon Financial was up 1{, to 34}. Bank of New
York closed at 34}, up 1}. And American International Group rose 3
9/16, to 87 3/16.
</P>
<P>
   Cisco Systems, EMC and Oracle were among the technology losers
Monday. Cisco fell 2 3/16, to 130 9/16. EMC shed 5, to 118. Oracle
fell 2, to 68 5/8.
</P>
<P>
   And reports that Yahoo was in talks to take a minority stake in
a company that News Corp. is creating to hold its satellite
television assets sent the stock down 3\, to 161 15/16.

   THE ABSENTEE VOTE: Election officials expect that, if past
voting patterns hold, perhaps half the votes cast in Tuesday's
primaries in Washington state will be absentee. In addition to
one-time requests for mail-in ballots, the state permits voters to
be sent absentee ballots automatically before each election; that
distribution list already includes about a third of the state's
voters. One problem is that balloting rules this year are
especially complex, requiring special care in marking and mailing
ballots if they are to count. Early indications are that some
voters are mismarking their ballots and envelopes.

Republican. Penny, who had been expected to run, had come under
considerable criticism from members of his party who viewed him as
too conservative. Penny had voted to restrict abortion, and has

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In Gov. George W. Bush's model schoolhouse, every student would
have to sit for an annual state test, and those students whose
schools consistently failed to make the grade would be given a
government check that they could use to attend a parochial or other
private school.
</P>
<P>
   If Sen. John McCain were the nation's principal in chief, there
would be an even larger program of federally-financed vouchers, but
states would decide individually whether to use standardized tests
to make high-stakes decisions about who could get the vouchers.
</P>
<P>
   Former Sen. Bill Bradley would be as concerned with testing the
teachers as he would the students. Vice President Al Gore would
test teachers only in their first year, and then shower them with
federally subsidized goodies, including raises and signing bonuses
of up to $10,000 each, especially for those working in
hard-to-staff districts.
</P>
<P>
   Mindful that improving education ranks atop most voters' wish
lists, the four leading contenders for the presidency have each
weighed in with their ideas, enough so that it is possible to
compare how teachers and students might fare under their
administrations. Though distinguishing the Republican proposals
from the Democrats is generally easier than making comparisons
between the candidates within each party, some aspects of the four
plans do not fit neatly into ideological frames.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Bush, a Republican, and Bradley, a Democrat, would
be the most punitive of the four candidates on schoolwide
performance. The Texas governor would hold the threat of a federal
voucher over the heads of schools that fail to improve, while
Bradley, a former senator from New Jersey, would wield the hammer
of state takeover. Both are responding to the same polls, which
plumb the depths of minority discontent with the most incorrigible
neighborhood schools.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, a Democrat, and McCain, a Republican, would be reluctant
to tie federal dollars to a school's academic standing. But while
the senator from Arizona seems intent on pleasing the conservative
wing of the Republican Party by extracting the federal government
from most school-level spending decisions, the vice president has
not challenged the nation's powerful teachers' unions, which have
endorsed him.
</P>
<P>
   Underlying the platforms of all four candidates is a central
frustration: with the federal government responsible for
contributing only 7 cents of every dollar spent in public schools,
each candidate is struggling to demonstrate how he would improve
performance from a perch so removed from the classroom.
</P>
<P>
   ``The leverage possibilities for the president to impact on
student achievement, which is what everyone's concern is, are
limited,'' said Christopher T. Cross, the president of the Council
for Basic Education, a nonpartisan organization.
</P>
<P>
   In seeking to increase that leverage, the candidates have, for
the most part, worked within parameters that have defined their
respective parties for generations.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Republican candidates feature more decision-making by
parents and by state officials,'' said Michael Kirst, a professor
of education at Stanford University. ``The Democrats feature less
decision-making by parents and more grants that are tied to
specific purposes.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Bush and McCain envision creating the nationwide voucher
program that conservative politicians and many minority parents
have demanded _ though Bush, in a grasp for the political center,
has avoided using the politically laden term ``vouchers,'' and
instead says federal education money should be ``portable.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain's proposal would create the most ambitious voucher
experiment yet, spending $5.5 billion over three years to present
one million students with vouchers of up to $2,000 annually. To
counter the argument that vouchers siphon money from public schools
when students leave, McCain would create a new source of financing:
the tax money now spent, through loopholes, as subsidies for the
oil and gas industry, sugar growers and ethanol manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
   The senator has yet to define how the vouchers would be awarded,
but he has said the poorest children in the worst schools would be
immediately eligible.
</P>
<P>
   Bush would, in effect, give vouchers of up to $1,500 each to
students in low-performing schools that fail to improve after three
years. But these vouchers would be financed with money drawn from
the $8 billion Title 1 program, which was established in the
Johnson administration to help low-performing schools.
</P>
<P>
   Both voucher proposals would probably face stiff opposition in
Congress. Not only would the industries targeted by McCain fight to
retain their share of subsidies, but the Republican-led House, as
recently as last fall, declined to consider a proposal that would
have created the very vouchers Bush seeks.
</P>
<P>
   The main differences between Bush's proposal and McCain's center
on the federal role in managing school spending. McCain has said he
would present most federal education money to states in
unrestricted block grants _ he would include an additional $500
million earmarked broadly for teachers' merit pay _ and leave it to
the states and districts to spend as they see fit. Bush favors
block grants as well, but would insist on annual tests for
elementary and middle-school students _ although the states would
write the tests and decide what constitutes improvement.
</P>
<P>
   Both Gore and Bradley envision a federal government far more
involved in education than one run by either of their Republican
opponents. Bradley would double the $8 billion spent annually on
Title 1 schools. Also, with an eye on the looming teacher shortage,
Bradley would offer annual scholarships of up to $7,500 to high
school seniors who commit to teach in an urban or rural school, or
in fields like special education, for at least five years.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Gore would burrow the federal government into the local
collective bargaining process in ways never before seen, offering
federally-financed raises of up to $10,000 to teachers in districts
that commit to aggressive reform programs. He would also offer
signing bonuses of up to $10,000 to 75,000 new teachers annually
who pledge to work in short-staffed districts.
</P>
<P>
   Although Bradley, swayed by the demands of minority parents, has
been more receptive to the prospect of an experimental voucher
program than Gore, who says his opposition is absolute, their
biggest differences lie in their approaches to expanding preschool.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley would add 400,000 children 1 to 5 years of age to the
Head Start program, which already provides intensive early
education to 800,000 children. But Gore would guarantee preschool
for all three million children who are 4 years old, and many who
are 3.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has said he would finance his proposal, an additional $115
billion over 10 years, by tapping 10 percent of the estimated $1.04
trillion federal surplus _ though he would face fierce opposition
in Congress. Bradley would spend an extra $175 billion over 10
years, and has said he would find much of that money in the
surplus.
</P>
<P>
   Of the two candidates' proposals, Bradley's emphasizes only a
few areas: expanding Title 1 and ensuring a high-quality teaching
force by requiring teachers to have majored in their subjects or to
take a test to demonstrate proficiency.
</P>
<P>
   But Gore's educational portfolio seemingly has something for
everyone, with provisions to reduce class sizes, build and renovate
schools and offer tax breaks for college savings accounts. That has
even some loyal Democrats worried.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you spread federal dollars too thinly,'' said Amy
Wilkins, a principal partner of the Education Trust, a nonpartisan
research and lobbying organization, ``you risk not doing anything
well.''

INDIA'S BEST BRAINS ARE RETURNING WITH MONEY AND HIGH HOPES

<TEXT>
<P>
   BOMBAY, India _ During the past generation, tens of thousands of
Indian engineers left home for America and many got rich _ some
fabulously rich _ in the high technology boom. Along the way, they
became symbols of a brain drain that scholars believed was sucking
the best and brightest minds out of Third World countries.
</P>
<P>
   But an increasing though still modest number of India's biggest
American success stories, whose lives are now firmly rooted in the
United States, are beginning to come home to India, too, and not
just to visit relatives, but to start companies, invest their
capital and indulge their philanthropic instincts. Some say they
should no longer be seen as proof of the brain drain, but as signs
of a brain trust _ a view economists say is still overly
optimistic.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, in an era when airplanes, telephones, e-mail and fax
machines have transformed the lives of prosperous immigrants,
economists say that the linear idea of a one-way brain drain is
giving way to a different paradigm of brains that circulate between
native and adopted countries.
</P>
<P>
   That pattern is now emerging in India, which watched as perhaps
25,000 of its top graduates since the late 1960s moved to the
United States. In the years when the technology explosion hit
America, these Indians emerged as major players and now run more
than 750 technology companies in California's Silicon Valley alone.
</P>
<P>
   One of those who got away was Kanwal S. Rekhi, 54, who now
periodically comes back for what he calls his ``missionary work in
India.'' He said he went to America so his brain wouldn't go down
the drain in socialist India, made $300 million as an entrepreneur,
executive and private investor in Silicon Valley and retired five
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Now, at the request of the prime minister's office in an India
that is more market driven, he is among those trying to raise $1
billion for the six Indian Institutes of Technology, elite public
universities here known as IITs, which produced the thousands of
graduates who left for the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The immigrants say they are returning now because many of them
have succeeded as entrepreneurs and have money to spare, because
there are economic opportunities in the increasingly open Indian
economy and because the Hindu nationalist-led government that has
been in power since 1998 is more open to their participation in the
country's affairs.
</P>
<P>
   It has, for example, challenged them to raise the billion
dollars for the IITs that educated them at India's expense before
they went to the United States, where they enriched the American
economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're credible, successful people,'' Rekhi said. ``Many of us
are worth hundreds of millions of dollars. We're available to the
Indian government and we provide a bridge to the United States. I
do fund-raisers at my house for congressmen all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   Examples of these to-and-fro millionaires abound.
</P>
<P>
   There's Desh Deshpande, 49, philanthropist. His high technology
telecommunications company, Sycamore Networks, was listed on the
Nasdaq in October. His net worth has since skyrocketed to $4
billion to $6 billion _ depending, he said, on the stock market and
which day the money gets counted. He and his wife plan to give $100
million over 20 years to their alma mater, IIT in Madras.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is that emotional tie,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Pradeep Singh, 42, a graduate of IIT, New Delhi, said his
``lottery ticket came through'' during 8 years as a manager earning
stock options at Microsoft. He quit in the mid-1990s to start his
own company, Aditi, that provides customer service via e-mail from
India for corporations abroad. He now has two companies, lives 4
months a year in Bangalore, 8 months in Seattle, and employs 600
people _ 350 of them in India.
</P>
<P>
   ``My Dad died recently,'' he said. ``He was proud of what I did
overseas, but that was nothing like what he felt about what I've
done here. He clipped all the stories.''
</P>
<P>
   And there's Rakesh Mathur, 43, a graduate of IIT, Bombay. He and
three other Indians founded the Silicon Valley company, Junglee.com
_ the original comparison shopping engine on the Web. The company
was sold in 1998 to Amazon.com in a stock deal that has made Mathur
$90 million richer.
</P>
<P>
   He still has homes in Mountain View, Calif. and Seattle, but
last year he also bought one in Pune. He has given $1 million to
his alma mater and started a new company, Purpleyogi.com, with
offices in Bangalore and Mountain View.
</P>
<P>
   On a recent visit to Bombay, he ventured back to the 500-acre
IIT campus here, driving down a grand main road lined by towering
bottle palms and past the new Kanwal Rekhi School of Information
Technology now under construction, named for the American-made
Indian philanthropist.
</P>
<P>
   For Mathur, who has the casual style of a Californian, it was a
double homecoming. He went to college here and grew up on the
campus because his father was a professor. He was back to visit a
troika of ambitious IIT students who are determined to get rich off
the Internet _ and who had succeeded in making him their mentor.
</P>
<P>
   Over 10-cent cups of coffee at a little outdoor cafe on campus,
these young men had hatched their ideas, then pursued Mathur
whenever he visited the campus and skipped a week of classes once
to meet with him when he was in Delhi.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're different than our classmates because we realized
there's opportunity here in India,'' said Kashyap Deorah, 20.
</P>
<P>
   Graduates of the IITs _ which are far harder to get into than
Harvard _ have formed a transcontinental good-old-boy network (most
of the students are still male) that connects Bombay, Bangalore and
Hyderabad to Silicon Valley, Seattle and Boston.
</P>
<P>
   The IITs themselves are among the few institutions in India that
are still seen as meritocracies, unsullied by political influence.
Admission is based solely on a grueling national entrance exam.
Last year, of the 98,000 students who took it, only 3,000 won
admission.
</P>
<P>
   And the United States continues to exert a magnetic pull on
Indian students and other Indian professionals. Last year, a third
of the 115,000 visas the United States issued to skilled workers
went to Indians.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can I be frank?'' asked Suman Kar, a 20-year-old senior at IIT
Bombay, as he explained why he has accepted a job in Silicon
Valley. ``It's the money.''
</P>
<P>
   Kar said his new job will pay about $60,000 a year, 7 times what
he would have earned here.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   IIT graduates have been the most sought after Indians in Silicon
Valley _ and Indians there have done very well, indeed. AnnaLee
Saxenian, an economist at Berkeley, documented in an analysis of a
Dun &AMP; Bradstreet database that 750 companies there are run by
Indians. Those companies produce more than $3.5 billion in sales
and employ more than 16,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   And as Indians have risen to positions of influence in corporate
suites throughout the American economy, they have played a crucial
role in giving credibility to business people based in India who
are selling software services to U.S. companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the Indian guy comes knocking at your door, selling
something, the first thought on your mind isn't snakes and
elephants,'' said Singh, formerly of Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   Exports of software from India have been growing by more than 50
percent a year in the 1990s as businesses here have found a niche
in employing high-skilled, low-wage computer engineers in India to
write computer code for businesses abroad.
</P>
<P>
   The industry now employs 280,000 people and is expected to have
$4 billion in revenues this year, the majority from sales to
American companies, according to the New Delhi-based National
Association of Software and Service Companies.
</P>
<P>
   Saxenian had once thought that few of them would take their
money or themselves back to India, but a recent visit to Bangalore
changed her view.
</P>
<P>
   She ran into an Indian entrepreneur from the valley, Sanjay
Anandaram, and learned that he had returned to help start a new
company that will develop and finance Indian technology ventures _
and he was not exceptional.
</P>
<P>
   ``Change is happening fast,'' she said. ``At every level, you
see personal and business connections to India that were not there
even two years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   The declining financial situation of the IITs is one of the
factors drawing them back. In 1993, the government cut its funding
of the IITs and for the first time allowed individuals to donate
money directly to the institutes. The alumni in the United States
have given most of the millions raised so far for the IIT in
Bombay. The Indus Entrepreneurs, a group founded by Indians in
Silicon Valley, has been instrumental in raising the money.
</P>
<P>
   Economists who had once seen the brain drain as harmful, now see
the diaspora it has spawned as a source of strength to developing
countries.
</P>
<P>
   ``The emigres often work as a Trojan horse, lobbying on your
behalf,'' said a Columbia University economics professor, Jagdish
Bhagwati, himself a native of India. ``They use external
opportunities to succeed prodigiously in different occupations. And
they can bring their skills and funds home to assist the country in
its economic take-off.''
</P>
<P>
   Mathur, the Web entrepreneur, is such a person. He wants to do
something for India, he said, because it interests him.
</P>
<P>
   The three IIT students he advises came up with an idea that
caught his imagination. On his recent visit, they formally
presented their proposal for a Web site called iportia.com. _ the
contents were still a trade secret _ in a conference room in a
downtown Bombay hotel.
</P>
<P>
   Mathur and another prominent IIT graduate, Nandan M. Nilekani,
chief operating officer of Infosys Technologies, and Deepak B.
Phatak, head of the computer science department at the IIT in
Bombay, listened attentively.
</P>
<P>
   When the students finished, the older men asked them to leave
the room, then considered whether to make this the university's
first attempt to incubate a student business that it would partly
own.
</P>
<P>
   The students stood outside waiting nervously. Would Mathur put
up the $250,000 on the university's behalf that would let them make
their dream real?
</P>
<P>
   After a half hour, the students were summoned back. The
grown-ups had decided that the young men had a great idea so simple
it could be expressed in five words, yet so sophisticated that it
would generate an entire Web world.
</P>
<P>
   The grinning students took turns shaking hands with Mathur, who
turned to the IIT professor, and exclaimed, ``Phatak, Sahib, they
have to make at least $100 million for you!''

   American Subtracts Seats to Add Legroom &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Coach passengers on American Airlines will soon have as much
legroom as they did more than a decade ago. The airline is spending
$70 million to remove two rows of seats from each of its 700
jetliners, giving passengers some extra legroom, the airline says.
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   American's overhaul comes after United Airlines announced last
August that it would make a similar increase in legroom, but only
for the first nine rows of coach seats, which it reserves for
full-fare coach passengers and its most frequent travelers. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Airlines measure legroom by seat pitch _ the distance from the
back of a seat to the back of the next seat. In recent years, coach
passengers have been squeezed into seats with a pitch of 31 inches
and, in a few cases, 29 inches. Most of American's coach seats,
like the first nine rows of coach at United, will now have a
34-inch pitch. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   These moves come as American and United, the nation's two
largest carriers, are halfway through five-year programs to replace
all seats on all but their newest planes with new ones designed to
be more comfortable, especially on long flights. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   More legroom comes at a price. The likelihood that the middle
seat in each row will be occupied will rise, and for those not
paying full fare or not having elite status in frequent-flier
programs, so will the risk of being assigned to these seats, which
are designated B and E on single-aisle jets. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Fewer rows will also mean more competition for free tickets in
frequent-flier programs. American is removing about 6.4 percent of
its seats; in recent years, analysts say, travelers using
frequent-flier awards have occupied about 11 percent. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Art of the Old West, Mythical and Realistic &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Old South is meeting the Old West at the Mississippi Museum
of Art in Jackson, where ``The American West: Out of Myth, Into
Reality,'' an exhibition of 117 paintings and sculptures, is on
view through June 6.
</P>
<P>
   Drawn from 67 public and private collections, the works trace
the development of the West from 1825 through 1925, as seen by
artists like Frederic Remington, Charles Russell and Albert
Bierstadt.
</P>
<P>
   As more and more of the frontier west of the Mississippi River
opened, artists flocked there to capture the spectacular scenery
and the promise of Manifest Destiny. Works like Bierstadt's
``Buffalo Trail: The Impending Storm'' and Charles Deas's
``Solitary Indian, Seated on the Edge of a Bold Precipice,'' both
in the exhibition, helped shape the popular view of the West.
</P>
<P>
   But sometimes they offered a romantic image that obscured
reality, and ``The American West'' attempts to counterbalance that
with works depicting the less savory aspects of the West's
settlement, like N.C. Wyeth's ``Gunfight.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The American West'' will also travel to the Terra Museum of
American Art in Chicago (June 24 to Sept. 17) and the Toledo Museum
of Art (Oct. 8 to Dec. 31).
</P>
<P>
   The Mississippi Museum of Art, 201 East Pascagoula Street, is
open daily 10 a.m. to 6 p.m., till 8 p.m. on Tuesday and Thursday.
Admission is $8. Information: (877) 662-9378.

   It's Spring in the South, Time for House Tours &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Visitors to Charleston and Virginia can tour a variety of
historic houses and private gardens during the 53rd Festival of
Houses and Gardens in Charleston, S.C., and Historic Garden Week in
Virginia. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Walking tours are the mainstay of the Charleston festival, from
March 16 to April 15. Itineraries include visits to the garden of
the William Gibbes House at 64 South Battery, with its 18th-century
parterres, magnolias, wax myrtles and noisette rosebushes. Morning
tours of Charleston's Historic District stop at the 18th-century
Georgian-style St. Michael's Church and the original South Carolina
Statehouse, among other sites.
</P>
<P>
   The Glorious Gardens tour, offered every Thursday during the
festival and on March 26, explores 10 private homes and gardens
bursting with azaleas, wisteria and magnolias throughout the
Historic District and the Ansonborough neighborhood _ the first
suburb of once-walled Charleston. Also scheduled are plantation
oyster roasts, on March 27 and April 4 and 12, at the splendid 1783
Drayton Hall plantation.
</P>
<P>
   Each festival event costs $40. For information and reservations:
(843) 722-3405 and www.historiccharleston.org. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Farther north, families across Virginia, from the Chesapeake Bay
to the Shenandoah Valley, are inviting visitors to tour their homes
as part of the state's 67th Historic Garden Week, April 22 to 30.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Historic James River plantations, including Brandon, Westover
and Belle Air _ all between Richmond and Williamsburg _ are among
the more than 250 sites that will be open to benefit the
restoration of historic grounds and gardens statewide.
</P>
<P>
   Other sites include Tuckahoe plantation the boyhood home of
Thomas Jefferson, in Goochland County; Epping Forest, the restored
18th-century home of George Washington's mother in Lancaster
County, in the Northern Neck by the Chesapeake; and a 400-acre
thoroughbred farm in Upperville, in the northwest.
</P>

   A Weekend for Those Who Really Like Cheddar &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Five hundred dollars may seem a stiff price for a hunk of
cheese, but at Shelburne Farms in Vermont, it comes with a
three-day cheese-making workshop and a two-night stay at the
luxurious Inn at Shelburne Farms. On May 12, 13 and 14, the farm
will put on a residential course, Pasture to Palate: The Art of
Cheese Making.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Shelburne Farms, on Lake Champlain, is a 1,400-acre working
dairy farm, a National Historic Site and a nonprofit environmental
education institution. It includes a turn-of-the-century Queen Anne
cottage, once owned by Dr. William Seward Webb and his wife, Lila
Vanderbilt, on grounds landscaped by Frederick Law Olmsted, the
designer of Central Park.
</P>
<P>
   The house has been refurbished and is open mid-May through
mid-October as an inn. The farm is also home to a prize-winning
cheese-making operation, producing cheddar from the farm's own herd
of registered Brown Swiss cows. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Participants in the course will tour the farm's pastures, visit
local organic farms and dine with cheese makers, farmers and other
agricultural experts. The purpose, according to the course
description, is to ``introduce the complex and dynamic relationship
between land, climate, grass, animals and milk that produces a vast
array of cheeses.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Meals will be served at the inn and, on one evening, at Mary's
of Baldwin Creek in Bristol, and will feature Vermont products. On
Sunday, participants will help make cheese at the farm's imposing
five-story Farm Barn. The cheese they help make will become
two-pound blocks of cheddar and, after being aged for six months,
will be shipped to participants for the winter holidays. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Fees are $525 to $550 a person double occupancy, and $595 to
$650 single, and include accommodations, meals, course material,
taxes and tips. Space is limited to 12.
</P>
<P>
   For more information or to register, contact Hillary Sunderland
at Shelburne Farms, 1611 Harbor Road, Shelburne, Vt. 05482, or
(802) 985-8686, or at hsunderland(AT)shelburnefarms.org.

HEALTHY HUNDLEY LIKES THE DIFFERENCE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   VERO BEACH, Fla. _ Todd Hundley is not spending most of his days
in the trainer's room with his elbow packed in ice. He's catching
regularly, firing balls to second base during drills and, unlike
last year, there's no reason to hide how he really feels.
</P>
<P>
   Hundley's right elbow is fine. The pain in his left wrist, which
kept him from hitting right-handed at the end of last season, is
gone. He finally feels like the player who set a major-league
record for homers by a catcher when he played with the Mets.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mind's at ease,'' said Hundley, who hit 41 homers in '96.
``Now, it's a normal spring training baseball season. Spring
training's always tough but not as tough as it usually is.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, we're doing everything we normally do, but usually
there's a week where you're hurt and sore and can't move, and then
you get going from there. This year it's not that bad.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Hundley said and did all the right things. He's not
one to complain, point fingers or make excuses, which is why he has
the utmost respect of his teammates. But his mental health was as
poor as his physical health. After an offseason of conditioning,
including lots of throwing, he feels much better.
</P>
<P>
   ``The doubts and all that stuff are gone and I'm able to get in
quality work without missing days,'' Hundley said. ``Last spring I
wasn't able to throw every day. I had to take days off from
throwing, especially the bases. Last year I missed a bunch of days
in the first week.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was tough (to hide it), but it's something you just do.
It's getting to know these guys early on, where last year there
were some of these guys I didn't catch during spring training. That
makes it very difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   Hundley's sore elbow also had an adverse affect on him
offensively. It limited his work in the batting cage, which hurt
his timing. For it, Hundley went through the worst season of his
career. Despite hitting 24 homers, he drove in only 55 runs and
batted .207.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line is to go out and play and get the job done,''
Hundley said. ``I'm not worried about anything. I'm just happy to
be healthy.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Wait a second? Monday's intrasquad game gave Mark
Grudzielanek his first chance to play second base in a game-type
situation and he admitted the feeling was strange.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was definitely weird,'' the former shortstop said. ``My
first steps were toward shortstop. I almost was going to go out and
take infield and throw the ball to third. Just as a joke.''
</P>
<P>
   Alas, Grudzielanek had little action. He caught the lone pop fly
hit his way before leaving after two innings because he fouled a
ball off his foot. He iced it and he's fine.
</P>
<P>
   __ Odds and ends: Johnson said it's likely Carlos Perez, who
pitched a scoreless inning Monday, would see his first Grapefruit
League action next Monday against Baltimore. Right-hander Darren
Dreifort pitched a scoreless inning. Paul LoDuca, fighting for the
backup catcher's job, homered in the intrasquad scrimmage off Jim
Bullinger. Left-hander Jeff Granger, trying to impress at every
interval, had a rough outing. He allowed five runs on five hits. .
. . Adrian Beltre's agent, Scott Boras, and Dodgers managing
general partner and CEO Bob Daly were expected to arrive in
Dodgertown late Monday to begin discussing a multi-year contract. .
. . Right-handers Chan Ho Park and Terry Adams are the featured
pitchers in today's intrasquad scrimmage.

   U.S. ISSUES REGULATIONS TO CONTROL TAX SHELTERS
</P>
<P>
   The government issued new rules to discourage abusive corporate
tax shelters. Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers said the
proliferation of such shelters ``may be the most serious compliance
issue threatening the American tax system today.''
</P>
<P>
   The rules are aimed at forcing the disclosure of shelters as
soon as they are created, so that they can be reviewed by the IRS
and, if found improper, can be banned before they become
widespread. This would replace the current practice of uncovering
the abuses through audits, often years later, and trying to undo
them in court, one case at a time.
</P>
<P>
   DAIMLERCHRYSLER PROFIT RISES 16 PERCENT
</P>
<P>
   DaimlerChrysler said that its profit for 1999 increased 16
percent, in line with analysts' expectations, as it benefited from
cost cuts, stronger vehicle sales and a rich mix of high-profit
models. For the fourth quarter, DaimlerChrysler's increased 32
percent. Investors were cheered by the results, lifting shares of
DaimlerChrysler by $2.1875, or 4.4 percent, to $65.6875.
</P>
<P>
   DOW AVERAGE RISES ABOVE 10,000
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average rebounded above 10,000 as
investors moved back into blue-chip stocks that have been battered
recently. The Dow rose 176.53 points, or 1.8 percent, to 10,038.65.
The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index also gained ground, rising
14.69 points, or 1.1 percent, to 1,348.05. But investors took some
profits in technology stocks. The Nasdaq composite index fell 12.65
points, to 4,577.85.
</P>
<P>
   INTERNET STRAINS MUSIC RELATIONSHIP
</P>
<P>
   The advent of electronic commerce and the prospect that
consumers will buy music by downloading it directly from the
Internet has strained the traditionally congenial relations between
record labels and record stores.
</P>
<P>
   ONLINE MARKET SITE FOR RETAILERS
</P>
<P>
   Oracle said that it would join with Sears, Roebuck and Carrefour
of France to create a global online marketplace for the retail
industry. Other retailers will be invited to join the venture,
GlobalNetXchange, which will focus on the combined $80 billion in
purchases that Sears and Carrefour make from 50,000 suppliers,
partners and distributors.
</P>
<P>
   SENATOR PROPOSES FEE REDUCTION
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Phil Gramm, who heads the Senate Banking Committee,
introduced legislation that would substantially cut the fees that
companies and investors pay the Securities and Exchange Commission
to register and trade stock. The bill would also give many
professionals at the SEC, including lawyers and accountants, raises
of up to 40 percent to help stem the brain drain at the agency.
</P>
<P>
   ISRAELIS CONCERNED ABOUT EXCHANGE
</P>
<P>
   When Frank G. Zarb, the chairman of the Nasdaq stock market,
visited Israel recently, he was not a traveling salesman drumming
up business. He was more like a potentate inspecting the outer
realms of a fast-expanding empire. Nearly as many shares in Israeli
stocks are traded on Nasdaq as on the Tel Aviv stock market, and
Israeli securities dealers worry that Nasdaq's Israeli portfolio
could soon eclipse the entire Tel Aviv Stock Exchange, both in
sheer size and in growth prospects. The only alternative, they say,
is to authorize automatic listings in Tel Aviv for Israeli
companies traded on Nasdaq and other U.S. markets, a proposal
resisted by government regulators.

SENATOR SEEKS REDUCTION IN FEES SEC PUTS ON TRADING 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By ALEX BERENSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Day traders and lawyers for the Securities and Exchange
Commission will each get a raise, if Sen. Phil Gramm has his way.
</P>
<P>
   Gramm, R-Texas, who heads the Senate Banking Committee,
introduced legislation Monday that would substantially cut the fees
that companies and investors pay the SEC to register and trade
stock. The bill would also give many professionals at the SEC,
including lawyers and accountants, raises of up to 40 percent to
help stem the brain drain at the agency.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next 10 years, the legislation would cut fees for
companies and traders by almost $15 billion, Gramm predicted.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those taxes are paid by Americans who are trying to save and
invest,'' Gramm said. ``They are a tax on accumulation, thrift and
retirement security.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the cost of the fees is hardly even a rounding error
for investors, amounting to about $3 for a $100,000 trade. But
securities firms argue that the fees, along with the somewhat
larger fees that the SEC charges companies to register their
shares, amount to a hidden tax on investors. Nasdaq market makers,
which must pay the fees on shares they buy and sell for their own
account, are especially anxious to see the fees reduced.
</P>
<P>
   The bill's chances are uncertain. The legislation has some
strong Democratic supporters, including Sen. Charles Schumer of New
York. Arthur Levitt, the chairman of the SEC, also spoke out
strongly in its favor at a hearing Monday in New York.
</P>
<P>
   But the White House, which is worried about the loss of a
relatively painless revenue source, has not yet indicated whether
it will support the bill. At Monday's hearing, Schumer said he was
``getting vibes that the administration will not be supportive on
this.''
</P>
<P>
   The fees are supposed to finance the commission's operations.
But because they are tied to the dollar value of the shares that
are registered or traded, the fees have soared along with the
markets since 1995. They are now much larger than the SEC's budget,
creating a windfall for the federal government. In 1999, the fees
totaled almost $2 billion, more than five times the cost of running
the SEC. The excess was spent on general government expenses.
</P>
<P>
   Under Gramm's legislation, the fees would be cut to roughly the
amount necessary to pay the SEC's budget. Charges for registering
stock would immediately fall by about 75 percent, and trading fees
would probably drop by about half, according to Levitt.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to cutting fees, Gramm's bill would give the SEC the
chance to raise salaries for many of its lawyers and accountants to
the levels already offered by the Federal Reserve Board and Federal
Deposit Insurance Corp. For example, a second-year lawyer with the
SEC makes about $66,000, while a member of the FDIC staff with
similar experience can be paid as much as $91,000, or 39 percent
more.
</P>
<P>
   Levitt called raising salaries essential in light of soaring
salaries for lawyers and accountants in private practice. Levitt
said his agency had lost one-fourth of its top professionals in the
last two years. ``We are in the midst of a terribly serious
staffing crisis,'' he said.

 EDITORIAL: MR. McCAIN'S CHALLENGE  
(sw) 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Tuesday, After weeks
of debate over the role of religion in American politics, Sen. John
McCain issued a courageous challenge on Monday to both his opponent
and his party to end their entangling alliances with
``self-appointed leaders'' of the religious right like Pat
Robertson and Jerry Falwell. The challenge, issued in Virginia,
followed by one day George W. Bush's attempt to defuse the
controversy over his visit to Bob Jones University in South
Carolina with a regretful letter to Cardinal John O'Connor of New
York. On Monday, however, McCain rolled right past the Bush
apology, hardly acknowledging its existence while pounding his
rival as a ``Pat Robertson Republican'' and asserting that the time
had come to free the Republican Party from two decades of
subservience to the ``union bosses'' of the religious right.
</P>
<P>
   In an unusual primary season, this was an extraordinary moment.
All of a sudden some people, McCain included, are talking about a
struggle for the soul of the Republican Party, with McCain seeking
to marginalize the religious right while Bush seeks to include it
in a Republican tent not unlike that fashioned by Ronald Reagan and
embraced by Bush's father. This may indeed be happening, and if it
is, it may well turn out to be healthy for a party that has for too
long been tied to the cramped ideology of the Falwells and the
Robertsons. But what is also going on is a short-term struggle for
the hearts and minds of voters in the forthcoming New York primary.
</P>
<P>
   By speaking out against Robertson and Falwell in Virginia, a
stronghold of Christian conservatism, McCain seemed willing to risk
modest political punishment there in exchange for a sizable boost
among Republican moderates in New York, including Catholic voters
angered by Bush's appearance at Bob Jones University, an
evangelical institution that prohibits interracial dating and
promotes anti-Catholic views.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Bush seemed to have exactly the same audience in
mind when he sat down to write an explanatory letter to O'Connor,
the archbishop of New York and the de facto leader of American
Catholics. His letter was welcome as an assertion of what Bush says
are his true racial and religious values. But this was a tactical
apology, not a muscular engagement of the university's philosophy
or its long history as a seedbed for bigotry wearing a theological
disguise. With his letter Bush was bowing, no more deeply than
absolutely necessary, to two political realities. One is that the
Bob Jones episode had acquired a political afterlife stronger than
anyone expected. The second is that Bush had to try to clean up his
record before facing millions of increasingly restive Catholic
voters in New York and other states with big Catholic
constituencies.
</P>
<P>
   With these exchanges, the Republican campaign has seen an
extraordinary turnabout. McCain is looking like a progressive,
while Bush, who campaigned for months on a message of social
inclusiveness and ``compassionate conservatism,'' now finds himself
writing letters that try to argue he is not a social reactionary,
but in language carefully crafted not to offend the leaders and
activists of the religious right by challenging their divisive
zealotry.

<TEXT>
<P>
   VIRGINIA BEACH, Va. _ Taking his presidential campaign to a
stronghold of Christian conservatism, Sen. John McCain of Arizona
delivered a harsh attack Monday on the ``self-appointed leaders''
of the religious right, depicting them as intolerant empire
builders who ``have turned good causes into businesses'' while
attempting to exclude all but ``card-carrying Republicans'' from
the party.
</P>
<P>
   McCain singled out for criticism two of the Christian right's
best-known leaders, Pat Robertson, the founder of the Christian
Coalition, and the Rev. Jerry Falwell, the founder of the Moral
Majority. He compared Robertson to ``union bosses who have
subordinated the interests of working families to their own
ambitions,'' and he accused both men of attempting to distort his
position on abortion and ``smear the reputations of my
supporters.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The politics of division and slander are not our values,''
McCain said during a somber address to some 4,000 people who packed
a high school gymnasium here only 30 miles from the headquarters of
the Christian Coalition. ``They are corrupting influences on
religion and politics and those who practice them in the name of
religion or in the name of the Republican Party or in the name of
America shame our faith, our party and our country.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain's remarks came on the eve of another primary day in what
has become a bitter battle with Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, a
fight that has become increasingly focused on the appeals Bush made
to religious conservatives in winning the South Carolina primary.
And while McCain's statements Monday may cost him votes among the
religious right in Virginia, whose contest is one of three to be
held on Tuesday, his aides were counting on media coverage to
attract more moderate voters in New York, Ohio and California _ who
vote on March 7 and are more crucial to McCain's overall strategy.
</P>
<P>
   Campaigning in Washington state Monday, Bush dismissed McCain's
remarks. ``This is a political game that Senator McCain is trying
to play by pitting one group of people against another,'' he said
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a problem-solver,'' he added. ``It sounds like he's a
finger-pointer.''
</P>
<P>
   Robertson could not be reached for comment, but the Christian
Coalition released a statement saying, ``Christian Coalition will
rise above this transparent effort to divide one American from
another on the basis of religion. Our pro-family message of faith
and freedom will draw citizens to the polls in record numbers as we
encourage all people of faith to continue their active involvement
in the process we call Democracy.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for Falwell said he would have no comment. During
his address, and again in interviews with reporters, McCain
repeatedly framed his speech not as an attack on the Christian
right, but as an appeal to religious conservatives to join him in
condemning political tactics pursued by Robertson and Falwell on
behalf of Bush..
</P>
<P>
   As he has for weeks, McCain on Monday accused Robertson of
slandering his national campaign co-chairman, former Sen. Warren
Rudman, R-N.H., in telephone calls to voters, by calling him a
``vicious bigot'' for criticisms he had made of the religious
right. McCain also suggested that leaders of the religious right
may have been behind other calls and e-mails to voters accusing him
of fathering children out of wedlock and pointing out that he and
his wife, Cindy, have adopted a daughter from Bangladesh.
</P>
<P>
   ``Neither party,'' he added, ``should be defined by pandering to
the outer reaches of American politics and the agents of
intolerance, whether they be Louis Farrakhan or Al Sharpton on the
left, or Pat Robertson and Jerry Falwell on the right.
</P>
<P>
   ``Political intolerance by any political party is neither a
Judeo-Christian nor an American value,'' he also said.
</P>
<P>
   On his campaign bus, he told reporters, ``Before South Carolina,
I don't think I would have given a speech like this.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain's aides said the speech was partly intended to
reemphasize Bush's avid support from Christian conservatives one
day after he expressed regret, in a letter to Cardinal John
O'Connor of New York, for an address he gave at Bob Jones
University, a bastion of the religious right in South Carolina
whose leaders have spoken harshly of Catholics and banned
interracial dating.
</P>
<P>
   McCain referred to Bush in his speech as a ``Pat Robertson
Republican who will lose to Al Gore,'' and later, his press aides
distributed a packet of campaign materials and news reports that
they said showed numerous links between Bush's campaign and top
officials at Bob Jones University. One Bush flyer quoted Bob
Taylor, a dean at Bob Jones University, praising Bush for his
``pro-family leadership.''
</P>
<P>
   More broadly, McCain described his speech as part of an effort
to redefine the Republican Party itself, to move it closer to the
center, much as President Clinton tried to do to the Democratic
Party during his 1992 campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are the party of Ronald Reagan, not Pat Robertson,'' McCain
said in his speech. ``We are the party of Theodore Roosevelt, not
the party of special interests. We are the party of Abraham
Lincoln, not Bob Jones. Join us. Join us.''
</P>
<P>
   As he concluded, the crowd _ half of which were high school
students _ stood and applauded enthusiastically.
</P>
<P>
   Bush scoffed at the senator's claims: ``Ronald Reagan didn't
point fingers. He never played to people's religious fears, as
Senator McCain has shamelessly done.''
</P>
<P>
   In California, Leslie Goodman, a Republican political consultant
in Sacramento who backs Bush, said of McCain: ``Truly, the prince
of candor has turned into the king of media pander. But what he is
really doing is confirming to rank-and-file Republicans that he's
at war with everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   According to McCain's aides, the idea of the speech was first
suggested by McCain's campaign manager, Rick Davis, during a flight
on Friday from San Diego to Cleveland. As McCain's senior advisers
debated whether to make a campaign stop in Maryland or Virginia,
Davis suggested going to Virginia and making a speech some place
like Lynchburg, where Falwell is based. But the campaign settled on
Robertson's back yard instead. ``It's not just a major moment in
this campaign, it's a major moment for social conservatives,'' said
Marshall Wittman, a former legislative director for the Christian
Coalition who advises McCain and joined the campaign for the
speech.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday McCain's speechwriter, Marc Salter, began drafting the
address, and revisions continued until an hour before the speech.
There was an air of anticipation about McCain as his bus pulled up
to Cox High School. McCain, who likes to encourage the view that he
is a straight talker who refuses to pander to audiences, said he
relished the prospect of taking on Robertson in what one aide
described as a ``target-rich environment.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I must admit,'' McCain said before getting off the bus, ``that
being on the Death Star is an environment we've become comfortable
with.''
</P>
<P>
   But while McCain was offering up jaunty Star Wars metaphors and
insisting he was unconcerned by the political risks of criticizing
the leaders of the religious right, he and his aides took several
steps to minimize the chances that some would interpret his words
as an attack on all Christian fundamentalists.
</P>
<P>
   They made certain to stud the speech with signposts of McCain's
conservative record _ from his eagerness to ban partial birth
abortions, to opposition of tax increases, to his admiration for
Ronald Reagan. And during his speech, McCain was careful to praise
several leaders of the religious right, including Chuck Colson,
founder of Prison Fellowship, an evangelical group that ministers
to inmates.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let me be clear,'' McCain said. ``Evangelical leaders are
changing America for the better.''
</P>
<P>
   He also brought along with him a well-known social conservative,
Gary Bauer, a former Republican presidential candidate and once the
executive director of the Family Research Council. ``If this were
an attack on Christian voters I wouldn't be here today,'' said
Bauer, who endorsed McCain shortly after he dropped out of the
race.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Still, there was no disguising the extraordinary sight of a
major Republican candidate so directly and vehemently denouncing
two highly visible leaders from the very wing of the party that for
nearly 20 years has been a dominant force in getting Republicans
elected.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether he was concerned that his speech might rupture the
Republican Party, McCain flipped the question around toward
Robertson and Falwell.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've already ripped the party apart with what they did in
South Carolina and other campaigns,'' he said as his campaign
airplane left Virginia for the West Coast. ``I'm trying to bring
the party back together.''
</P>
<P>
   Several aides pointed out that reconciliation was central to the
one passage in the speech that brought a hush over the otherwise
squirming high school students. In the passage, McCain recounted
the time he was tied up in ``torture ropes'' and left in an empty
room after his capture in the Vietnam War. A guard, he said,
loosened the ropes, then tightened them before his ``less
humanitarian comrades returned.''
</P>
<P>
   Months later, McCain said, the two of them stood together in the
prison courtyard on a Christmas morning. Without uttering a word,
McCain said, the guard drew a cross in the dirt with his sandal.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is my faith,'' McCain said. ``The faith that unites and
never divides, the faith that bridges unbridgeable gaps in
humanity.''

WORKERS ARE TRAPPED IN LIMBO BY INS
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 BY SARA ROBINSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Like thousands of other professionals, Nick Saw
came to the United States to apply his skills in the booming
high-technology industry, working under a temporary visa. And like
many temporary workers, Saw wants to stay.
</P>
<P>
   But the prospect of establishing a lasting foothold in the
United States makes him, in some ways, a captive to his employer,
which sponsored his visa application. If he tries to switch
companies, or is laid off, he has to start the immigration process
all over. Even the company he works for, Hewlett-Packard, cannot
promote him if it will change his basic job description.
</P>
<P>
   And the period of limbo for such workers can be long. Saw, a
30-year-old British citizen, applied for a green card, which gives
permanent residency status, when he arrived two years ago; he will
probably have to wait several more years.
</P>
<P>
   He plans to stay with his job for now, he says, but he is
frustrated about having so little control over his future. ``I'd
sooner leave the country than put my life on hold all over again,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Legions of foreign professionals at high-tech companies across
the country are in the same position. Over the last decade, tens of
thousands have been admitted to the United States each year on
temporary work visas to address what the technology industry says
is a severe shortage of skilled workers.
</P>
<P>
   Now the industry is pushing to expand the largest such visa
program, known as H-1B, which allows workers to stay in the United
States for six years. Under legislation introduced this month in
the Senate, the annual allotment of the six-year visas _ which had
already grown to 115,000 in 1998 from 65,000 in 1990 _ would be
temporarily increased to 195,000. Those with advanced degrees from
American universities will be exempt from the limitations.
</P>
<P>
   But even as the gates have been opened wider, the road to
permanent immigrant status has become more difficult. Over the last
two years, the Immigration and Naturalization Service has become
increasingly unable to cope with its growing workload, and the wait
for a green card has stretched to several years.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1990, the law has allotted 140,000 green cards each year
to applicants sponsored by employers, but that limit has never been
reached. Last year, only 62,000 cards were issued despite a backlog
of hundreds of thousands of applications. Ron Gotcher, an
immigration lawyer in Los Angeles, said he advised clients applying
for green cards to be prepared to wait at least five years.
</P>
<P>
   For workers from India and China, the problem is particularly
acute. Although more than half the H-1B visas go to citizens of
India or China, the law specifies that only 7 percent of
employment-based green cards can go to applicants from any one
country. So applicants from India and China often wait several
years for an open slot before they can even apply. If their visas
expire, the workers must leave the country for at least a year
before they can restart the application process.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the workers compare themselves to indentured servants.
</P>
<P>
   ``The information technology revolution is occurring on the
backs of these workers,'' said Pradeep Chaphalkar, a green-card
holder from India who is a spokesman for the Immigrants Support
Network, an organization of workers seeking permanent residency.
</P>
<P>
   When the visa program was introduced in 1990, the stated goal
was to bring in workers temporarily to fill jobs for which there
were no American workers. But the technology boom in the 1990s
created an unceasing demand for skilled workers.
</P>
<P>
   Now the ``temporary'' designation is largely ignored by
employers, who recruit workers with the promise of aid in
immigration, and employees, who see work visas as a route to
permanent residency.
</P>
<P>
   But a green-card application must specify a job and employer,
and those cannot be changed. And in a market in which job hopping
is the norm, being tied to one employer can be a hardship.
</P>
<P>
   ``For years I am supposed to be doing exactly the same thing for
exactly the same company, and that is so unlikely in this area,''
said Nenad Nedeljkovic, a Serb working in Silicon Valley. ``I get a
couple of calls every week from recruiters, and every time I tell
them that I have to wait.''
</P>
<P>
   From the foreign workers to their employers to organized labor,
all seem to acknowledge that the system is flawed, but agendas for
reforming it diverge widely.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate legislation, endorsed by the American Electronics
Association, enjoys strong bipartisan support. In addition to
increasing the number of H-1B visas through 2002, it would
liberalize the per-country limits on green cards.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Spencer Abraham, R-Mich., who heads the the Senate
immigration subcommittee and is a sponsor of the bill, said the
immigration service had been ``very unresponsive'' to the problem.
</P>
<P>
   Large high-technology companies say the foreign labor pool is
essential. Mary Dee Beall, government affairs manager at
Hewlett-Packard, says that if companies cannot hire the workers
they need by bringing some in from overseas, they will shift jobs
abroad.
</P>
<P>
   Unions, however, are concerned that the system is susceptible to
employer fraud and abuse. The AFL-CIO has called for training
American workers and enforcing labor laws in lieu of bringing in
more workers from abroad.
</P>
<P>
   Assertions that companies exploit the system to pay foreigners
less are hard to document. But some workers say they are paid far
less than the average for people with their education, skills and
experience.

DEFENSE IN TRIAL OF OUSTED PAKISTANI LEADER QUITS IN PROTEST 
</HEADLINE>
  (Subs to correct name of Judge Jaffri throughout) 
jt) 
 By BARRY BEARAK    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW DELHI, India _ The hijacking trial of the deposed prime
minister of Pakistan _ already a cavalcade of the unexpected and
the bizarre _ took another odd twist over the weekend as his entire
defense team quit to protest supposed government unfairness.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am an attorney, and my job is to help my client, but that
has become impossible when the court has placed an embargo on his
rights,'' Ijaz Batalvi said in a phone interview from Lahore
Monday. ``For months, my client has been scandalized and maligned.
By what authority is he now being denied his turn to speak?''
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Judge Rehmat Hussain Jaffri accepted a prosecution
request that any testimony by the former prime minister, Nawaz
Sharif, be given in secret. It would be released to the public only
after the court determines that nothing is ``likely to tarnish and
affect the security, integrity and solidarity'' of the nation,
which has been under military rule since Oct. 12.
</P>
<P>
   Defense lawyers lashed out at the decision, and on Sunday,
Batalvi and his colleague Khwaja Sultan Ahmed announced that they
would boycott the rest of the trial.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecution reacted angrily, saying the defense objections
were ``a mere pretext in light of overwhelming evidence'' against
Sharif.
</P>
<P>
   The ousted prime minister, his brother Shahbaz and five others
face charges that include hijacking, treason and attempted murder.
Hijacking is a capital offense.
</P>
<P>
   At present, only two of the accused _ Ghous Ali Shah, once an
adviser to Sharif, and Rana Maqbool, the former inspector general
of police in Sindh Province _ are represented by lawyers. The next
session of the trial, being held in Karachi, is set for Wednesday.
By law, the court must appoint new defense lawyers, though the
defendants can reject them and appear as their own counsel.
</P>
<P>
   The case stems from Oct. 12, when Sharif fired the army chief of
staff, Gen. Pervez Musharraf, and then supposedly conspired to deny
landing rights to a commercial plane that was carrying the general
to Karachi.
</P>
<P>
   As the aircraft meandered through the skies, its fuel supply
dwindling, the military coup took place, and army officers took
command of air traffic control. By the time the plane landed
safely, Sharif was in custody and Musharraf was in charge of the
country. Since then, the Constitution has been placed in abeyance.
</P>
<P>
   Under international pressure to restore democracy, General
Musharraf has promised that the trial will be held in complete
openness.
</P>
<P>
   Sharif, like all criminal defendants, is required to read a
statement to the court. It is expected that he will lambaste his
military successors and make an emotional appeal to his countrymen
and the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever Nawaz Sharif has to say is of no danger to the
nation, only to the regime that has seized its control,'' Batalvi
said.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton is trying to decide whether to add Pakistan to
his itinerary during a trip to India and Bangladesh next month, a
choice complicated by the coup. Last month, Musharraf demanded that
all higher court judges either resign or swear an oath of loyalty
to the military government.
</P>
<P>
   The trial is being held in a special anti-terrorism court, a
creation of Sharif himself, who wanted speedy justice for heinous
offenses. The court's expedited proceedings preclude the appeal of
a ruling like the one Jaffri made on Friday on Sharif's testimony.
</P>
<P>
   The judge has been an on-again, off-again presider in the case.
During pretrial hearings, the military decided to change some of
the nation's anti-terrorism laws, deciding that only a high court
judge could hear such important matters.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Shabir Ahmed took over, but he abruptly quit on Jan. 12,
complaining that so many government intelligence agents were
present in the courtroom that ``I cannot provide a fair trial.''
</P>
<P>
   He returned the case to Jaffri, who again had to deal with the
consistent complaints of the defense lawyers: that they were being
denied the right to examine prosecution evidence, that they were
kept from meeting with their clients, that their hotel rooms were
bugged.
</P>
<P>
   The chief witness against Sharif is Amanullah Chaudhry, the
former director general of the Civil Aviation Authority. He was
originally one of the defendants and had complained, through his
lawyer, that he was under such emotional strain that he was
considering suicide. Not long after, he became a prosecution
witness, testifying that Sharif personally called him three times,
ordering him to divert the plane.

 EXCERPT FROM McCAIN'S SPEECH ON RELIGIOUS CONSERVATIVES  
(With McCAIN-RIGHT) 
(lb) 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Following is an excerpt from a speech that Sen. John McCain of
Arizona delivered Monday in Virginia Beach, Va., as provided by his
campaign's Web site:
</P>
<P>
   I run for president, my friends, because I believe deeply in the
greatness of America's destiny.
</P>
<P>
   We are the world's lantern of freedom and opportunity, the
bright beacon of hope that our fathers fought to bequeath us and
our children were born to inherit. But I know that unless we
restore the people's sovereignty over government and their pride in
public service, unless we reform our public institutions to meet
the demands of a new day and unless we renew our sense of national
purpose, we will squander our destiny.
</P>
<P>
   Toward that end, I have called for the reform of campaign
finance practices that have sacrificed our principles to the
demands of big money special interests. I have spoken against
forces that have turned politics into a battle of bucks instead of
a battle of ideas. And for that, my friends, I have been accused of
disloyalty to my party.
</P>
<P>
   I am also proud to help build a bigger Republican Party, a party
that can claim a governing majority for a generation or more, by
attracting new people to our cause with an appeal to the patriotism
that unites us and the promise of a government that we can be proud
of again. And for that, I have been accused of consorting with the
wrong sort of people.
</P>
<P>
   Well, my friends, I have always acted in what I believe to be
the best interests of my country. And I always believed that what
is good for America is good for the Republican Party.
</P>
<P>
   I don't believe it's loyal to suggest that the Republican Party
cannot stand on its own feet and fight for public opinion without
six- and seven-figure contributions from people with interests
before government but not necessarily ideas to sustain our
country's greatness. I don't believe it's loyal to suggest that the
Republican establishment is more important to save than a
Republican majority. I believe it is the height of foolishness to
build a wall around our party in fear that we are so narrowly
defined that new faces and fresh ideas in accord with our basic
principles will jeopardize our values.
</P>
<P>
   America is more than the sum of its divided parts, and so our
party should be. America is more powerful than its established
power centers, and so our party should be. America is greater than
the accumulation of wealth, and so our party should be.
</P>
<P>
   This is my message to my party and my country. It is an honest
Republican message that threatens none of our party's principles or
the social values of any constituency in our party. On the
contrary, it is an inclusive but principled message that trusts in
the people to guide our nation in this new century.
</P>
<P>
   I am a conservative, my friends, a proud conservative, who has
faith in the people I serve. But those who purport to be defenders
of our party, but who in reality have lost confidence in the
Republican message are attacking me, they are people who have
turned good causes into businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Let me be clear. Evangelical leaders are changing America for
the better. Chuck Colson, head of Prison Fellowship, is saving men
from a lifetime behind bars by bringing them the good news of
redemption. James Dobson, who does not support me, has devoted his
life to rebuilding America's families. Others are leading the fight
against pornography, cultural decline and for life. I stand with
them.
</P>
<P>
   I am a pro-life, pro-family, fiscal conservative, and advocate
of a strong defense. And yet, Pat Robertson, Jerry Falwell and a
few Washington leaders of the pro-life movement call me an
unacceptable presidential candidate. They distort my pro-life
positions and smear the reputations of my supporters.
</P>
<P>
   Why? Because I don't pander to them, because I don't ascribe to
their failed philosophy that money is our message.
</P>
<P>
   I believe in the cause of conservative reform. I believe that
because we are right we will prevail in the battle of ideas,
unspoiled by the taint of a corrupt campaign finance scheme that
works against the very conservative reform of government that is
the object of our labors.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican Party will prevail because of our principles,
because that's what it's about, my friends, principles, not special
interest money or empire or ego.
</P>
<P>
   The union bosses who have subordinated the interests of working
families to their own ambitions, to their desire to preserve their
own political power at all costs are mirror images of Pat
Robertson. Just as we embrace working people, we embrace the fine
members of the religious conservative community. But that does not
mean that we will pander to their self-appointed leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Some prefer to build walls and exclude newcomers from our
support. Apparently, appeals to patriotism can only be heard by
card-carrying Republicans, and only certain Republicans at that,
not the kind of Republicans who might dissent from the soft money
ethics of a tired party establishment.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, Republican reformers, independent reformers or
Democratic reformers, any group that might, like the Reagan
Democrats of 20 years ago, be attracted to our cause of
conservative reform and national greatness, are too great a threat
to the Washington status quo.
</P>
<P>
   That surprises me, since the essence of evangelism is to seek
converts. My campaign is bringing new people into the Republican
Party every day. I don't apologize for this. No, I wear it as a
badge of honor. I will not padlock the Republican Party, and
surrender the future of our nation to Speaker Gephardt and
President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   My friends, we are building a new Republican majority, a
majority to serve the values that have long defined our party and
made our country great. Social conservatives should flock to our
banner.
</P>
<P>
   Why should you fear a candidate who believes we should honor our
obligations to the old and the young? Why should you fear a
candidate who believes we should first cut taxes for those who need
it most? Why should you fear a candidate who wants to reform the
practices of politics and government so they fairly reflect your
aspirations for your family and country? Why should you fear a
candidate who would sign without hesitation a partial-birth
abortion ban or who would work tirelessly with anyone to improve
adoption and foster care choices for those who might be considering
the taking of unborn life. Why should you fear a candidate who
shares your values?
</P>
<P>
   My friends, I am a Reagan Republican who will defeat Al Gore.
Unfortunately, Governor Bush is a Pat Robertson Republican who will
lose to Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   I recognize and celebrate that our country is founded upon
Judeo-Christian values. And I have pledged my life to defend
America and all her values, the values that have made us the
noblest experiment in history.
</P>
<P>
   But political intolerance by any political party is neither a
Judeo-Christian nor an American value. The political tactics of
division and slander are not our values.
</P>
<P>
   They are corrupting influences on religion and politics and
those who practice them in the name of religion or in the name of
the Republican Party or in the name of America shame our faith, our
party and our country.
</P>
<P>
   Neither party should be defined by pandering to the outer
reaches of American politics and the agents of intolerance whether
they be Louis Farrakhan or Al Sharpton on the left, or Pat
Robertson or Jerry Falwell on the right.
</P>
<P>
   Many years ago a scared American prisoner of war in Vietnam was
tied in torture ropes by his tormentors and left alone in an empty
room to suffer through the night. Later in the evening a guard he
had never spoken to entered the room and silently loosened the
ropes to relieve his suffering. Just before morning, that same
guard came back and re-tightened the ropes before his less
humanitarian comrades returned. He never said a word to the
grateful prisoner, but some months later, on a Christmas morning,
as the prisoner stood alone in the prison courtyard, the same good
Samaritan walked up to him and stood next to him for a few moments.
Then with his sandal, the guard drew a cross in the dirt. Both
prisoner and guard both stood wordlessly there for a minute or two,
venerating the cross, until the guard rubbed it out and walked
away.
</P>
<P>
   That is my faith; the faith that unites and never divides; the
faith that bridges unbridgeable gaps in humanity.
</P>
<P>
   That is my religious faith, and it is the faith I want my party
to serve, and the faith I hold in my country. It is the faith that
we are all equal and endowed by our Creator with inalienable rights
to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. It is the faith I
would die to defend.
</P>
<P>
   Don't let anyone fool you about me, my friends, or about this
crusade we have begun.
</P>
<P>
   If you want to repair the people's confidence in the government
that represents us, join us.
</P>
<P>
   If you want to restore the people's pride in America, join us.
</P>
<P>
   If you want to believe in a national purpose that is greater
than our individual interests, join us.
</P>
<P>
   We are the party of Ronald Reagan not Pat Robertson. We are the
party of Theodore Roosevelt not the party of special interests. We
are the party of Abraham Lincoln not Bob Jones. Join us. Join us.
</P>
<P>
   Join us and welcome anyone of good faith to our ranks. We should
be, we must be, we will be a party as big as the country we serve.
</P>
<P>
   Thank you, and God bless.

EDITORIAL: THE MESSAGE OF THE DIALLO PROTESTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Tuesday, Feb. 29:
</P>
<P>
   The thousands of marchers who filled New York City streets last
weekend were shocked and pained by the verdict acquitting four
police officers in the shooting death of Amadou Diallo. They were
understandably outraged that an innocent man had been shot down in
his own doorway by officers who thought he was acting suspiciously.
But even for those who accept the jury's verdict as legally sound,
the marches sent a powerful message that many New Yorkers,
especially in minority communities, think the police are a threat
to their lives and safety. Indeed, it is hard to believe that a
white resident, standing in his own vestibule, would have been
gunned down under similar circumstances by the four white officers.
The Diallo case, and the restrained weekend protests it inspired,
are an urgent call for police reforms designed to minimize the
likelihood of another such tragedy.
</P>
<P>
   The protests show the deep wounds that have been created by
aggressive police tactics in minority neighborhoods. Every year
tens of thousands of blacks and Latinos have been subject to ``stop
and frisk'' tactics by the police. The fear, given the Diallo case,
is that any one of those encounters could turn deadly if the police
misread the situation and a citizen makes a sudden move.
</P>
<P>
   The case is far from over. The Diallo family is expected to file
a civil lawsuit against the city for the killing. The U.S.
Attorney's office is reviewing all aspects of the case for possible
civil rights violations. The four officers also still face a
departmental investigation into their actions.
</P>
<P>
   The weekend protests were passionate, but demonstrators and the
police showed admirable restraint in avoiding physical
confrontation. The Diallo family and the Rev. Al Sharpton set a
peaceable tone by urging the crowds to shun violence.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Rudolph Giuliani also made temperate remarks after the
verdict, showing sympathy for the Diallo family and citing the need
for all police procedures to be open to review. But on Monday, he
focused less on policy changes than on what he deemed to be unfair
criticism of the police. Still, the Police Department has to be
held accountable for its mistakes. Many who do not quarrel with the
verdict believe this killing could have been averted if the
officers were better trained, knew the neighborhood well and were
of a mindset less apt to suspect criminality in the most innocent
conduct.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani and Police Commissioner Howard Safir need to examine
precisely how police attitudes and procedures may have contributed
to this killing. They need to modify the department's ``stop and
frisk'' policies that are intruding on the rights of law-abiding
people. They need to increase training on how to avoid turning a
tense situation into a deadly one. Only the most intense efforts to
reform police procedures can assure New Yorkers that a similar
incident will not happen again.
</P>
<P>
   Some policy changes are under way. Late last year Safir
decentralized the Street Crime Unit. That may help officers get to
know the neighborhoods better. Efforts to recruit minorities to the
department have increased. More Street Crime officers are now in
uniform, making it less likely that civilians will mistake the
police for robbers.
</P>
<P>
   These reforms came out of Amadou Diallo's death. But the fact
that an innocent life had to be lost before changes were made has
driven a public concern by no means limited to minority
communities. Giuliani needs to show he understands that concern by
pushing new reforms in the department's training and
community-relations policies.

 By CATHY HORYN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MILAN, Italy _ Donatella Versace, who still has people chuckling
over the on-the-air call she made to a local radio station to
complain that its impersonator did not sound a bit like her, gave
the world-weary fashion crowd something new to talk about on Friday
night. At the conclusion of her racy show, Versace came out in a
see-through pants ensemble that, top to bottom, left little doubt
about where the sun shines.
</P>
<P>
   ``Very simple, a vision of gold,'' was how the perennially
tanned Versace sweetly summed up her outfit, which consisted of
black chiffon and strips of snakeskin sewn here and there but not
necessarily in the right places, as she arrived for a post-show
dinner at the family's palazzo. By then, she had changed into a
relatively tame-looking silver sequined halter number.
</P>
<P>
   Versace, whose publicists insist that she is really a shy
person, has struggled to prove that she is more than her late
brother Gianni's impudent little sister. With this collection, she
has shown she has a pretty good idea about what, in this age of
live Internet links and short attention spans, millions of ordinary
people expect from fashion. They want glamour, fun, fast clothes,
laser lights shooting out of the mouths of Medusas, and girls,
girls, girls _ lots of models whose expressions of withering
contempt would make some poor guy checking out the action on
Vogue.com grin with idiot fright.
</P>
<P>
   It's such a simple idea. After all, there aren't enough people
who have the patience, much less the style of life, for the
ladylike clothes, tweeds and expensive furs that have been
streaming down the runway with the opulent reserve of Edith Wharton
pruning her roses.
</P>
<P>
   And sophistication: what can the term mean to consumers who are
buying up stuff at such a frenetic rate they don't have time to
consider whether it's gauche or marvelous? One can argue that
Versace's new clothes for fall 2000 _ the skintight silk pants with
fur bombers, the slinky jersey dresses twisted in a knot at the
bosoms, the glimmering Medusa-head belts _ are for a woman whose
sense of sophistication is still in its provincial stages.
</P>
<P>
   But there again, the world is awash with people nobody has heard
of, making staggering amounts of money in ways nobody ever dreamed
of, and increasingly they seem to be saying, like Versace with her
up-and-out ensemble, What's the point of having it all if not to
enjoy, be noticed?
</P>
<P>
   So Versace hit a nerve with this collection, her most confident
since taking over the designs of the house. There were grid-pattern
coats, swanky furs in pastel sheared mink with snakeskin belts, and
chiffon blouses and shirt dresses in swirling hues that suggested
ecstatic IQ puzzles. The show had spunk, not the least because of
Aretha Franklin belting out her female anthem ``Respect'' on the
soundtrack, but what it really had was a flesh-and-blood feeling of
life.
</P>
<P>
   The number of designers who infuse their clothes with genuine
wit and sophistication, who are well read and can constantly relate
the present to something they know in the past, is down to a few
and fading fast. The other day in the Fendi showroom, surrounded by
Midas-size tables laden with gold bracelets and chains, Karl
Lagerfeld was sipping a Coke, perusing the latest French Vogue and
discussing Alan Seeger, an American poet whose letters and World
War I diary he plans to publish this year, illustrated with
Lagerfeld photographs.
</P>
<P>
   Lagerfeld's ability to throw out a lot of references and keep
them spinning is dazzling. His show for Fendi, on Thursday,
incorporated such cool items as Fendi logo-tattooed stockings and
gold-heel boots in electric blue and green with butterscotch
leather skirts, graphic knits in Sonia Delauney prints and fur
coats in brilliant acid-hue geometric blocks. The coats and knits,
made by piecing together strips of material in a pattern, showed
off Fendi's craftsmanship, but it was Lagerfeld's alert, chaotic
mix _ here a sleek black fur coat over zingy stripes, there a
glitter of gold chain nestled in a glam-white mink _ that gave the
clothes their knowing edge.
</P>
<P>
   The Marni show on Friday was pretty, with childish colors and
posy prints mixed with funky khaki trousers, Carnaby stripes and
silver sequined cardigans, but its artsy-craftsy style seems a bit
threadbare right now. The theme at the Moschino show was ``The
Wizard of Oz.'' That meant ruby-red shoes and other giddy
accessories mixed with fairly straightforward frock coats, studded
leather and striped knits that seemed to have no relation to one
another. As an editor said on the way out the door, ``It was
Munchkin ado about nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   Monday, the Italian fall season ended with strong showings by
Alberta Ferretti, Miu Miu and Giorgio Armani. Among the trends
emerging from the Milan shows were vintage-inspired looks from the
1940s and '70s, tight turtlenecks, black mixed with chocolate brown
and camel, acid hues, belted waists, flaring skirts and lots of
gold.
</P>
<P>
   Ferretti kept things romantic, in her fashion, with wispy
dresses detailed with pleats and worn under lanky tweed coats. A
coat in a gold cloque fabric with a dark fur collar seemed to
spring off the zebra-striped 1960s-era banquettes at El Morocco,
but with almost everything this season circa-something, it was in
the groove.
</P>
<P>
   To anyone familiar with images of the Duke and Duchess of
Windsor posed in summer clothes in their garden, the Miu Miu
collection, designed by Miuccia Prada, will recall something of
their fondness for sportive French dressing.
</P>
<P>
   With peaked little burlap hats on their heads, the models came
out in red-striped cotton knit tops with flaring skirts in white
twill cotton (finished at the waist with bias tape), sleeveless
dresses and swing jackets in worn-looking gray and maroon tweed,
and lingerie tap pants worn with sleeveless tweed tops tied in the
front sailor style. Combined with drowsy oboe music and
bobby-pinned hair, the show was a bit of a dowdy-rama through an
old folks' home, yet charming in its singular vision.
</P>
<P>
   Armani needs a bit to champ at _ for a while, the bit was his
rival Gianni Versace; these days, it's the popularity of Prada and
Gucci, whose clothes he thinks are revivalist. ``When Miuccia needs
an idea for a collection, she opens her closet,'' he scoffed in an
interview. When asked if he thought his stance was just a case of
sour grapes, Armani calmly replied that it might be if his clothes
didn't sell, adding that ``it's normal for every era to have an
`it' name.''
</P>
<P>
   Armani should hardly worry. His collection smoothly covered all
the bases, emphasizing cut, particularly in jackets and
close-fitting leather separates, which are strong for fall, and
subtle mixes of velvet and chenille textures. There were flashes of
color, but Armani wisely dealt out black, cobalt and gray. After an
Ascot finale of beaded black and white evening dresses and pants,
Armani appeared out of the darkness, grinning and sitting
cross-legged on a platform like a levitating genie.

MUSEUM SUES IN BID TO KEEP METEORITE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Oregon)  (mk) 
 By BENJAMIN WEISER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The American Museum of Natural History asked a
federal court in Manhattan on Monday to declare the museum the
rightful owner of one of its oldest and most treasured exhibits,
the 15-ton Willamette Meteorite, which an Indian group in Oregon is
claiming as a sacred tribal object.
</P>
<P>
   The Indian group, the Confederated Tribes of the Grand Ronde
Community of Oregon, has formally requested the return of the
meteorite under a federal law that allows for the repatriation of
Native American cultural and religious artifacts from museums that
receive government money.
</P>
<P>
   But the museum contends that the meteorite, which is believed to
have fallen to earth 10,000 years ago from the asteroid belt
between Mars and Jupiter, is not the kind of sacred object covered
by the law, known as the Native American Graves Protection and
Repatriation Act of 1990.
</P>
<P>
   In its lawsuit filed in U.S. District Court in Manhattan, the
museum contends that the meteorite, which was found in the Upper
Willamette Valley in Oregon, was ``a natural feature of the
landscape, rather than a specific ceremonial object,'' as described
in the law.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel we have a strong case under the law,'' said Evan A.
Davis, a lawyer for the museum, which has placed the meteorite
prominently in its $210 million Rose Center for Earth and Space,
which opened recently to large crowds and enthusiastic reviews.
</P>
<P>
   The meteorite, which sits on a steel pedestal in the
planetarium's Cullman Hall of the Universe, is so big that parts of
the museum had to be built around it, officials have said. The
museum bought it for $20,600 in 1906 from Oregon Iron and Steel
Co., which owned the land on which it was found.
</P>
<P>
   The land had been given up voluntarily by various Indian tribes
in an 1855 treaty with the United States in exchange for
reservation land and other considerations, the lawsuit said.
</P>
<P>
   Tracy Dugan, a spokeswoman for the Confederated Tribes, did not
return a phone call seeking comment Monday. One tribe that is part
of the Grand Ronde confederation, the Clackamas, saw the meteorite
as a sacred representation of sky, earth and water and adopted it.
Dugan has said that the meteorite was ``a sacred object to the
people of the Willamette Valley'' and that they want it returned.
</P>
<P>
   Neil deGrasse Tyson, the director of the planetarium, estimated
that 40 million to 50 million people have seen the meteorite,
including ``untold numbers of visitors who were turned on to
science because of their encounter with this meteorite.''

ANGELS' SEASON: ONE TO REMEMBER, AND ONE TO FORGET
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By MURRAY CHASS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPE, Ariz. _ If uncertainty resides in the Anaheim Angels'
clubhouse this spring, it is more welcome than the chaos that
dominated the clubhouse last season. One or more of the players who
are here now may not be by the time the season begins. Jim Edmonds,
for example, has been mentioned in trade talk for months. Darin
Erstad is a player the Yankees are said to covet. They are
discussed in possible trades because the Angels have an excess of
starting outfielders. Last year they had an excess of intramural
strife.
</P>
<P>
   The turmoil, coupled with a series of injuries to key players,
resulted in a last-place finish and the resignations of the manager
and the general manager.
</P>
<P>
   ``What went on wasn't pretty and it wasn't something that we're
proud of,'' Tim Belcher, at 38 the oldest player on the team's
roster, said Monday. ``It's not something I was proud to be a part
of.''
</P>
<P>
   Belcher, who wanted to leave the specifics in the past, called
the season bad, frustrating and embarrassing.
</P>
<P>
   It was, in essence, a free-for-all in Southern California:
players against manager and players against players. If someone
could have developed a more self-destructive method, the Angels
would have used it.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the past this team had come up short so many times,'' Mo
Vaughn said. ``What you needed was for everybody to be on the same
page and go for that one common goal. That's where we went wrong.
We were going in many different directions.''
</P>
<P>
   Recalling his time in Boston under Manager Jimy Williams, the
burly first baseman said: ``The best situation I've ever been in to
this point was with Jimy. You know he's in control and he's in
charge. It just seemed that there was none of that here. It seemed
like everybody was going in opposite directions. We weren't on the
same page.''
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn, who arrived in Anaheim on a lucrative free-agent flight,
was supposed to lead the Angels to a division championship, but
instead was right in the middle of the mess.
</P>
<P>
   Some players questioned his loyalty to his teammates when he
failed to join them in defending Troy Percival, the team's closer,
when he became involved in an on-field fight. Vaughn was in the
clubhouse and explained later that he could not get out fast enough
on an ailing ankle that he had injured on opening day.
</P>
<P>
   Edmonds was disliked by some players who questioned his desire
and his willingness to play hard. Erstad at one point called his
teammates soft. Gary DiSarcina, the shortstop, said the team from
top to bottom was the most unprofessional organization he had seen.
</P>
<P>
   One group of players did not like the high-strung manager, Terry
Collins; another group did not like the first group for complaining
about Collins.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a little bit of everything that shouldn't be going
on, but not a lot of any one thing.'' Belcher said.
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn became more immersed in the morass over his view of
Collins. The stories that emerged had Vaughn going to the front
office with complaints about the manager, but Vaughn said Monday
that a club official had solicited his opinion, not the other way
around. He did not say who had approached him, but the official was
believed to be Tony Tavares, the club president, who was not at the
Angels' camp Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``They asked me some questions and I answered them,'' Vaughn
said. ``I was asked about the situation. I made my comments
truthfully. I didn't really want to make them. That's how the whole
thing came down.''
</P>
<P>
   In spite of, or perhaps because of, the negative feeling in the
clubhouse about Collins, the Angels extended his contract. But the
situation continued to deteriorate, and Collins finally became fed
up with the players and resigned with a month left in the season.
Bill Bavasi resigned four weeks later as general manager.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Scioscia, the former catcher for the Los Angeles Dodgers,
is now the manager. Bill Stoneman, a longtime executive of the
Montreal Expos, is the general manager.
</P>
<P>
   Scioscia, best remembered for a game-tying home run against
Dwight Gooden that led to the Mets' demise in the 1988 playoffs,
said he had not brought up the events of 1999 in talking with the
players this spring.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't here last year to experience it,'' he said. ``It's a
nonissue from where myself and the staff are coming from. We're
letting guys know where we're coming from. What's important is what
we do with these players now and the trust factor.''
</P>
<P>
   The players said they had learned from their experience last
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I learned a lot,'' Vaughn said. ``My job as a player is to go
out there and do my job. The general manager is going to do his
job. It's not for me to be a general manager. If people ask me
questions about this or that, I'm not going to comment.''
</P>
<P>
   Belcher said the turmoil is being left behind. ``It was hashed
out throughout the year last year,'' he said. ``By the end of the
year it was understood that mistakes were made and lessons learned.
This year will be a time to figure out if, in fact, lessons were
learned. I think they were.''
</P>
<P>
   How can he be certain?
</P>
<P>
   ``Part of what makes me confident,'' he said, ``is that the guys
who were involved in some situations are the same guys who took the
lead in rectifying it, saying we can't let this happen again. But
you don't want to completely forget, because there were some
lessons to be learned in order not to repeat itself. I think we'll
be all right.''

 STATE'S DOCTORS WANT MORE CLOUT WITH HMOs  &HT;     BY TOM ABATE 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
Doctors in private practice in California have taken a major step
toward forming the equivalent of a union by asking the state
Legislature to provide their trade associations the power to
negotiate fees and contracts with health maintenance organizations.
<P>
   State Sen. Jackie Speier, D-Hillsborough, who introduced the
legislation, said California HMOs have forced physicians to accept
such low fees that doctors are caught between their duty to
patients and the realities of how much insurers are willing to pay
for care.
</P>
<P>
   ``HMOs in California have created this green-eyed monster, and
we, at least, want to pluck its eyes out,'' Speier said.
</P>
<P>
   Jack Lewin, chief executive of the California Medical
Association, which represents 34,000 doctors, said patients will
benefit if physicians have more bargaining power when setting
contracts with HMOs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The imbalance right now is such that physicians have little or
no authority in the negotiating process,'' Lewin said. ``It's take
it or leave it.''
</P>
<P>
   But HMO lobbyist Bill Wehrle, with the California Association of
Health Plans, called the bill a ``brazen power grab'' that would
lead to higher insurance costs and more expensive health care.
</P>
<P>
   ``Doctors would have you believe this is all about patients and
improving quality, but it's not,'' Wehrle said. ``They're asking
for a license to collude. This is California's answer to OPEC.''
</P>
<P>
   Speier's bill, the Quality in Health Care Contracts Act, is
modeled on a Texas law that went into effect in September. Five
other states and the District of Columbia are considering similar
legislation, which takes advantage of court decisions that allow
states to make certain exemptions from federal antitrust laws.
</P>
<P>
   California Medical Association legislative director Norman
Plotkin said Speier's bill would define the circumstances under
which doctors, who are generally organized as professional
corporations, can be exempted from antitrust laws that prevent
businesses from setting rates or terms of service.
</P>
<P>
   In the physicians' setting, the rates usually pertain to the
fixed monthly amount that doctors receive for every HMO member in
their care. The terms of service might spell out what sort of
approval is needed before a doctor can refer a patient to a
specialist.
</P>
<P>
   If the bill becomes law, a doctor or a medical group could
designate the medical association or some other nonprofit entity to
bargain with the HMO on their behalf.
</P>
<P>
   This third-party negotiator would have to be certified by the
state attorney general, who would also decide whether the HMO would
have to negotiate with the doctors' representative.
</P>
<P>
   In the event of an impasse, the attorney general could order an
arbiter to settle the dispute. The medical association's Plotkin
said consumers would be protected against price gouging because the
attorney general would have to approve any rates or terms that
resulted from such negotiations or arbitrations.
</P>
<P>
   Jamie Court, a spokesman for the watchdog group Consumers for
Quality Care, in Santa Monica, gave the proposal a lukewarm
endorsement.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's such a grave imbalance between HMOs and physicians
that something needs to be done,'' said Court, who noted that he
was still concerned about possible price fixing.
</P>
<P>
   Pat Powers, president of the Pacific Business Group on Health,
the San Francisco group that represents large insurance buyers,
objected to Speier's bill.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think competition between health care practitioners is one
of the ways we have to hold down costs,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Speier's bill and similar bills in other states,
legislation has been introduced in Congress by Rep. Tom Campbell,
R-Campbell, to exempt doctors from antitrust laws at the national
level.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton administration antitrust officials have testified
against Campbell's proposal on the grounds that it would lead to
higher health-care costs. Susan Pisano, a spokeswoman for the
American Association of Health Plans, the national HMO lobby, said
the same critique applies to Speier's bill.
</P>
<P>
   ``Doctors can already form practice associations or medical
groups that are quite large,'' she said. ``They don't tell you that
in many cities one or two medical groups already bargain for most
of the doctors.''
</P>
<P>
   But the California Medical Association's Lewin said that in
California, where a few HMOs handle most of the patients, doctors
are being forced to accept contracts that lower the amount they can
collect for services. He said a medical association study showed
that from 1990 to 1993, doctors received an average $45 per month
for every HMO member in their care. By 1997-99, that per-month
compensation had dropped to $29.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want to be a union, but there has to be some equity
in the negotiations between doctors and HMOs,'' he said.

KAISER REPORTS NARROWER LOSS FOR 1999  &HT;       
 BY TOM ABATE
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
The Kaiser Foundation Health Plan was only $6 million in the red
last year, as the HMO giant continued to show signs that it has
turned the corner after huge losses in the two preceding years.
<P>
   The nation's largest and oldest health maintenance organization,
Kaiser reported a shocking $266 million loss in 1997, its first in
nearly 50 years of operation. In 1998, the health giant reported an
even larger net loss of $288 million.
</P>
<P>
   But thanks to insurance rate hikes in the neighborhood of 10
percent, and the divestiture of some money-losing subsidiaries in
the Northeast and North Carolina, Kaiser managed to narrow its 1999
loss to $6 million.
</P>
<P>
   Kaiser officials said that if it discounted the costs associated
with selling the unprofitable units as well as some other one-time
charges, the HMO actually enjoyed a net income of $466 million last
year. Kaiser reported total revenues of $16.8 billion in 1999,
compared with $15.5 billion for the previous year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We still have a long way to go,'' said Kaiser Chief Financial
Officer Dale Crandall, ``but the prognosis for a complete recovery
over the duration of our multiyear turnaround plan is good.'' The
nonprofit health organization said it expects its total revenue to
increase 8 percent this year, while costs increase about 6 percent.
Its rates are expected to increase by roughly 8 percent this year.
</P>
<P>
   Kaiser said its California division, still the heart of the HMO,
reported an operating surplus of $280 million, a ``significant
improvement'' over the unit's $354 million operating deficit in
1998.
</P>
<P>
   Kaiser said that division had added 185,389 members, bringing
total state enrollment to nearly 6 million. Nationwide, membership
slumped 2.5 percent, to 8.3 million.
</P>
<P>
   Kaiser said its other divisions in Hawaii, the Northwest,
Colorado, Kansas City, Ohio and Georgia reported positive financial
results. But the HMO said its mid-Atlantic division, which insures
540,000 people in Virginia, Maryland and the District of Columbia,
still lost money in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Kaiser spokeswoman Beverly Hayon said the HMO has a plan in
place to reverse the losses in the mid-Atlantic and has no plans to
eliminate a division that remains ``important strategically,
financially and politically.''

YAHOO MAY EXPAND TIES WITH MURDOCH  &HT;       
 BY VERNE KOPYTOFF
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
As old and new media continue to explore joining forces, Yahoo, the
most popular Internet site, and News Corp., Rupert Murdoch's media
conglomerate, have held talks that may lead to a broad alliance
between the two companies, according to a magazine report.
<P>
   The Yahoo and News Corp. talks come a month after giant online
service America Online and Time-Warner, the media empire, announced
their merger. Some analysts believe that Yahoo and News Corp. are
trying to find a way to counter that proposed marriage between
their rivals.
</P>
<P>
   The alliance could allow Yahoo to make many of News Corp.'s
publications and television programming available through its Web
site. News Corp. has a rich stable of content _ everything from the
brash Fox Network to action films produced by 20th Century Fox to
newspapers like the New York Post.
</P>
<P>
   Yahoo could also get preferred access on a satellite-based
Internet delivery service that News Corp. is developing. The
service would allow consumers to to access the Internet from their
television, eliminating the need for a computer or telephone lines.
</P>
<P>
   In return, News Corp. could gain greater visibility on the
Internet and a Web portal for its satellite service. Until now, the
company has had minimal success in creating a presence on the Web.
Its Web portal, Iguide, launched in 1995 with help from MCI, the
telephone company, was closed in 1997 after losing millions of
dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Yahoo co-founder Jerry Yang and News Corp. President Peter
Chernin have held several discussions covering a ``wide-ranging
alliance,'' according to the New Yorker magazine, which reported
the news in its March 6 issue. The two executives have yet to sign
a contract.
</P>
<P>
   If there is an agreement, it will not be for several weeks, an
executive quoted in the New Yorker article said. News Corp. and
Yahoo already have a marketing alliance.
</P>
<P>
   Santa Clara's Yahoo and New York's News Corp. would exchange
stock in the deal. But neither investment would come close to a
controlling interest, the magazine said. It is unclear how far the
discussions have progressed.
</P>
<P>
   Both companies declined to comment on the record.
</P>
<P>
   But one News Corp. executive said her company has talked with
several firms about developing a satellite network. She declined to
name those companies.
</P>
<P>
   Rob Enderle, a technology analyst with Giga Information Group,
called Yahoo's alliance discussions ``just another indication that
Yahoo is very concerned about the AOL-Time Warner merger.'' He said
Yahoo wants to join News Corp.'s satellite project in case AOL
tries to lock it out of the cable Internet system it is developing
with Time-Warner.
</P>
<P>
   Since its inception, Yahoo has been steadfast in remaining
independent as many of its competitors joined forces with other
companies or were bought out. For example, Alta Vista is mostly
owned by the venture capital firm CMGI, and Disney bought the
Internet portal Infoseek in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   While an alliance with News Corp. would fall short of ending
Yahoo's neutrality, Enderle said, it does signal a change in
direction.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly, they are becoming less and less independent,''
Enderle said.
</P>
<P>
   Charlene Li, an Internet industry analyst with Forrester
Research in Cambridge, Mass., agrees that Yahoo is interested in
the satellite access, but not out of fear of AOL. She said Yahoo is
trying to increase its growth in places like Asia, where satellite
Internet service through television has a big potential because
phone lines are inadequate and many people do not have computers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yahoo is very determined to stay independent,'' Li said. ``I
see no advantage to them for offering just Fox content.''
</P>
<P>
   Yahoo has already reversed its long-held policy against creating
its own online magazines and newscasts. The company has recently
started hiring people to staff a financial news show that it plans
to produce and broadcast on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of trading yesterday, Yahoo's stock had declined
$3.19, to $162. News Corp.'s stock increased $2.94, to $51.19.

STILL TIME TO ADD AN IRA  &HT;       
   
 BY ARTHUR M. LOUIS
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
Question: I've already filed my 1999 income tax return. I did not
put any money into my deductible individual retirement account for
1999. May I still do that?
<P>
   Answer: Yes, you may do it between now and the due date for your
1999 return, which most likely is April 17.
</P>
<P>
   But because you already sent in your return, you will have to
file an amended return to claim the deduction for your 1999 IRA
contribution, says Internal Revenue Service spokesman Jesse Weller.
</P>
<P>
   You can amend the return using IRS Form 1040X, which you can
download from the IRS Web site at  &LR; www.irs.gov. &LR;  Or, get a copy by
calling the IRS toll-free telephone number: (800) 829-3676.
</P>
<P>
   Weller cautions that if you have a refund coming on the return
you already filed, you should wait until the refund check arrives
before filing your amended return. If the amended return reaches
the IRS while it is still processing your original return, ``it
will delay processing of the initial refund,'' Weller says.
</P>
<P>
   That wouldn't be fair to you, because _ assuming you figured
your taxes correctly _ you are fully entitled to that initial
refund. You will get an additional refund after you send in the
amended return with the IRA contribution deducted from your income.
</P>
<P>
   Stock Archaeology
</P>
<P>
   Q: You recently discussed how investors can find historical
stock prices on the Internet for stocks that are still listed. But
what about historical prices of companies that no longer trade
because they have merged _ such as Alumax, which was acquired by
Alcoa? This sort of research can help determine the cost basis of
stock for tax purposes.
</P>
<P>
   A: I was able to find quotes for Alumax starting in 1993 and
ending in 1998 _ when it stopped trading _ on the FinancialWeb site
at  &LR; www.financialweb.com. &LR;  Go to that site, then click on the link
for ''Stocks.'' On the next page, enter the ticker symbol (`'AMX''
in the case of Alumax) and indicate that you want ``Historic
Price/Vol.'' You then will be prompted to enter the date
parameters.
</P>
<P>
   One hitch: I found that you must already know the former stock
symbol for Alumax, because FinancialWeb's ticker-search function
couldn't look it up for me. Evidently a stock must still be trading
to be included in the ticker search.
</P>
<P>
   If for some reason FinancialWeb doesn't help you find past
prices of a particular delisted stock, you might _ and I hesitate
to suggest this in the cyberage _ put on your shoes and go
outdoors. Go over to the nearest public library, and ask to look at
the appropriate back issues of The Chronicle or any other newspaper
that publishes daily stock prices. That's one way people did stock
research in the ancient past _ say, the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   I hope this advice won't brand me as a Luddite.
</P>
<P>
   Medical Deduction
</P>
<P>
   Q: My wife suffers from hydrocephalus and lives in an
assisted-care facility because she cannot completely operate on her
own. Is this deductible in whole, or in part, as a nursing home
would be?
</P>
<P>
   A: IRS spokesman Weller says it doesn't matter whether the sign
on the front of the building says ``nursing home'' or
``assisted-care facility.'' There is nothing magical about the name
for tax purposes.
</P>
<P>
   The key consideration, he observes, is whether your wife
receives medical services there.
</P>
<P>
   If the primary purpose for lodging your wife in this facility is
for medical treatment, Weller says, then the full cost of her stay
_ not only the medical treatment, but also room and board _ can be
classed as a deductible expense.
</P>
<P>
   ``If she needs around-the-clock medical attention, and the only
other option is hiring a nurse at your home, that's medical, not
personal,'' Weller remarks.
</P>
<P>
   You have to be able to demonstrate to the IRS that the primary
purpose of your wife's stay is for medical treatment. If you hope
to do this, you probably ought to enlist the help of a professional
tax preparer.
</P>
<P>
   If medical reasons are not the primary purpose of her stay,
Weller adds, you still qualify for a deduction for any medical
services your wife receives at the facility. He suggests that you
ask the management to list the medical costs separately when they
bill you.
</P>
<P>
   Medical expenses, which you enter on Schedule A of Form 1040,
are not fully deductible from income. You can deduct them only to
the extent that they exceed 7.5 percent of your adjusted gross
income for the year.

MUTUAL FUNDS HELP NEWLY RICH SHARE WEALTH WITH CHARITIES  &HT;       
 BY ARTHUR M. LOUIS
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
The booming economy and rocketing stock prices have made a lot of
ordinary people affluent and a lot of affluent people rich. Now,
many of them are looking for the best way to give some of their
superfluous money to charity.
<P>
   To serve this expanding philanthropic market, three big
financial-service companies _ Charles Schwab, Fidelity Investments
and Vanguard _ sponsor what are known as charitable endowment
funds.
</P>
<P>
   The Schwab Fund for Charitable Giving began operating five
months ago and has accumulated $50 million in assets from more than
1,000 donors. It has paid out 1,000 grants, averaging more than
$3,500 apiece.
</P>
<P>
   Vanguard's endowment fund has $143 million under management from
1,100 donors _ an average of $130,000 each. The fund has made 2,200
charitable grants, averaging about $5,000.
</P>
<P>
   The Fidelity Charitable Gift Fund, formed seven years ago, is
the oldest of the three and the largest, with 21,000 donors and
$2.2 billion in assets.
</P>
<P>
   All these funds differ in details _ most notably, the minimum
amounts that individuals can contribute _ but all are designed to
make charitable giving hassle-free and tax-efficient for the newly
generous.
</P>
<P>
   Individuals can make tax-deductible _ but irrevocable _
contributions to the funds up front, then take their time about
parceling out money to specific charities. The funds send out the
donations and do all the paperwork.
</P>
<P>
   One enticing feature of the charitable fund is &LR;   &LR; that it permits
donors to contribute to virtually any charity of their choice,
rather than being limited to a list of charities such as those
offered by the United Way and other community charitable
organizations.
</P>
<P>
   Charitable funds are similar to foundations, but without the red
tape. Individuals who create foundations often find themselves
under intense scrutiny from the tax authorities, drawing heavily on
the services of lawyers and administrators.
</P>
<P>
   The Schwab, Fidelity and Vanguard funds insulate their
participants from any such unpleasantness. In return, they charge
fees ranging up to 1 percent of fund assets annually.
</P>
<P>
   The for-profit charitable funds are stirring up the charitable
establishment.
</P>
<P>
   They are drawing contributions away from the many nonprofit
community foundations that have been fixtures of the
charitable-giving scene for decades, says Robert Walker, director
of the Management Center consulting firm in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Community foundations operate much the same as for-profit
charitable funds, setting up tax-deductible accounts for individual
clients and handling all the paperwork. But they generally limit
their focus to local charities, while the charitable funds donate
money worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   However, Sterling Speirn, president of the Peninsula Community
Foundation in San Mateo, claims that the for-profit funds are less
threatening than they may seem. He says their heavy marketing
campaigns have generated a lot of interest in charitable giving,
and this will benefit all types of funds.
</P>
<P>
   ``The competition is very stimulating,'' Speirn says.
</P>
<P>
   Participants in a charitable fund can contribute either cash or
securities.
</P>
<P>
   If they contribute securities that have appreciated in value
since they were purchased _ likely after the long bull market _
they are entitled to a tax deduction for the full value and are
excused from paying capital-gains taxes on the appreciation.
</P>
<P>
   Each individual who donates to a charitable fund is assigned a
separate account and can choose from an array of mutual funds in
which the money will be invested, pending donation to charity.
</P>
<P>
   Donors can name successors to their accounts _ their children,
perhaps, or other family members _ who can carry on the giving
after they die.
</P>
<P>
   If they don't choose to name a successor, the charitable fund
will ask them to recommend a list of charities to inherit the
balance of the money in their accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Although donors can claim a charitable tax deduction as soon as
they put money in the fund, they are permitted to spend weeks,
months, even years deciding which charities will receive their
largesse.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, if the mutual funds do their jobs right, the original
donations will grow, increasing the money available for giving.
</P>
<P>
   While the donors are permitted to advise the fund where to
donate the money, the final decision is left to the fund's
trustees.
</P>
<P>
   In practice, however, the directors probably will approve
donations to any of the hundreds of thousands of charities that are
registered in the United States. (That can include U.S.-registered
foreign charities.)
</P>
<P>
   Donors who aren't sure where they want their money to go can
sort through capsule profiles of more than 650,000 registered
nonprofits on a database compiled by GuideStar, an organization
specializing in philanthropic research.
</P>
<P>
   The Schwab Fund for Charitable Giving provides a link to the
database on its own Web site.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Campbell, 55, a retired computer consultant in Palo Alto,
says he and his parents have contributed over the years to
``various charities.'' But, ``Due  &LR; t &LR; o the stock market and
real-estate appreciation, we have begun taking philanthropy more
seriously than before.''
</P>
<P>
   Already an owner of Vanguard mutual fund shares, Campbell
decided to sign up with the Vanguard Charitable Endowment Program
soon after it was established two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to make some contributions immediately,'' he says,
``but we liked the idea of an endowment program because we also
wanted to set up a fund from which we could make donations over an
extended period of time.''
</P>
<P>
   To participate in the Vanguard program, donors must initially
contribute at least $25,000 worth of cash or securities. Later
contributions to the fund must amount to at least $5,000.
</P>
<P>
   Campbell and his parents contributed more than $100,000
initially, ``and we continue to give,'' says Campbell. ``It takes
time to develop gift-giving skills. The Vanguard program is
appealing because we get immediate tax deductions, but can make the
disposition of funds as our understanding of philanthropy
evolves.''
</P>
<P>
   About 15 percent of the money that Campbell and his parents put
into the fund already has been paid out _ ``to environment and
education. We've set up a number of scholarships at Foothill and
DeAnza, the local community colleges, and to the Windy Hill Open
Space Preserve in Portola Valley.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the Vanguard endowment fund's most important roles, says
Ben Pierce, the fund director, is to smooth the way for
contributions to smaller charities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many smaller charities _ maybe your local church, for example
_ are not set up to handle gifts of appreciated stocks,'' he
observes. They may not have a procedure for selling the stocks, or
the capability to keep the proper records and credit the donor with
the appropriate tax deduction.
</P>
<P>
   ``By centralizing your donations with us, in one spot, the
stocks you give us will be liquidated by us and go out to charity
in the form of checks,'' says Pierce.
</P>
<P>
   The newly hatched Schwab Fund for Charitable Giving has
generated considerable interest. ``We're seeing people from across
the spectrum and across the United States,'' says David
Engelbrecht, vice president of the fund. ``A lot of Baby Boomers,
retirees, dot-com secretaries. There are a lot of affluent
people.''
</P>
<P>
   Schwab requires an initial contribution of at least $10,000, and
allows subsequent contributions as small as $1,000. The smallest
donation that participants can direct to a single charity is $500.
</P>
<P>
   Schwab charges an administrative fee of 0.75 percent annually on
accounts of less than $500,000, with the fees scaled down for
larger accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Ellis, 63, a venture capitalist who lives on Telegraph Hill
in San Francisco, decided to use the Schwab fund after having his
arm twisted by his neighbor, Peggy Ross, who happens to be the
fund's executive director. He had previously considered operating a
foundation but concluded that it would be too much bother.
</P>
<P>
   He contributed a ``substantial'' sum to the Schwab fund at the
end of last year and is ``just starting to distribute it.''
</P>
<P>
   Ellis plans to give away about half the money in his account
this year and then replenish it. Among the charities he favors are
the San Francisco Opera and the Farmland Trust. He also is
interested in helping various charities in Southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
   Cynthia Egan, president of the Fidelity Charitable Gift Fund,
says it was the third-largest charitable fund-raiser in the United
States last year, ranking behind only the Salvation Army and the
YMCA.
</P>
<P>
   Individuals can contribute as little as $10,000 initially, and
$1,000 subsequently. The minimum allowable grant to any particular
charity is $250.
</P>
<P>
   Fidelity charges an administrative fee of 1 percent for accounts
smaller than $500,000, with the fee scaled down to as little as
0.25 percent for larger accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Egan insists that participants get their fee's worth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Say you have someone who is on his own and wants to contribute
to 10 different charities,'' she observes. ``That's 10 different
transfers of assets, 10 separate receipts. If you're donating
appreciated securities, there's more paperwork to account for that.
With our fund, you make a single contribution and we take care of
the rest.''

 &HT;    CLINTON SHOOTS FOR GUN CONTROL, BUT FOES SAY HE'S OFF TARGET
 &HT;    Advance for Wednesday, Feb. 30
 &HT;    ATTN Texas papers
 &HT;    With GUNS-STATS and GUNS INTERNET
 &HT;    By EUNICE MOSCOSO 
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton keeps talking about guns.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past few weeks, the White House has discussed gun
shows, gun locks, gun clips, gun dealers, gun tracing, gun
licenses, gun accidents, gun prosecutions, gun safety courses, guns
in schools and guns in public housing.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has spoken about the recent shooting deaths of high
schoolers in Washington, D.C. and in Littleton, Colo. He honored
Jim Brady, who suffered a gunshot wound to the head in the 1981
attempted assassination of President Reagan. And in his State of
the Union address last month, Clinton invited the Colorado father
of a victim of the Columbine High School massacre as his personal
guest.
</P>
<P>
   Some would call it a full court press. With less than a year
left in his presidency, Clinton is pushing hard for ``common
sense'' gun control measures.
</P>
<P>
   But some East Texas Democrats don't see any ``common sense'' in
the proposals . Reps. Max Sandlin of Marhsall and Jim Turner of
Crockett, oppose many of Clinton's gun-related objectives this
year. Among them: mandatory safety locks on handguns and a ban on
importing large capacity ammunition clips or ``magazines.'' In
addition, Rep. Ralph Hall, of Rockwall, joins them in opposing a
72-hour waiting period for buyers at gun shows.
</P>
<P>
   ``The administration is absolutely wrong on this issue,''
Sandlin said. ``When they're wrong, I refuse to support them.''
</P>
<P>
   Sandlin, a longtime hunter and fisherman who owns ``15 to 20''
guns, said his constituents have grown up around firearms and are
not afraid of them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We view guns as a part of sports and part of protecting our
homes,'' he said. ``We have a constitutional right to bear weapons
and that's the way it is.''
</P>
<P>
   Regarding another Clinton proposal to create a state-based
licensing system for all handgun purchasers, Sandlin said, ``If the
administration wants a picture of people purchasing weapons in
Texas, they'd better load up a Polaroid and come down here because
that's the only way they're going to get it.''
</P>
<P>
   Hall and Turner also own firearms and represent heavily rural
districts. All three lawmakers receive money from the National
Rifle Association.
</P>
<P>
   ``The use of firearms for sporting purposes in East Texas is
just part of the culture,'' Turner said.
</P>
<P>
   ``In urban America I think there is a great deal of fear of
firearms. . .that may be the most significant difference between
rural and urban America.''
</P>
<P>
   But Rep. Chet Edwards, D-Waco, said elected officials might make
a mistake assuming that the vast majority of Texans side with the
NRA in opposing child safety locks and gun show background checks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have confidence that the majority of my constituents want to
protect their children from gun accidents and their families from
criminals being able to easily buy guns at gun shows,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Edwards, who is a hunter and owns a shotgun and a pistol, said
he supports the NRA on some issues but not when it comes to
``common sense gun safety legislation that will save lives.''
</P>
<P>
   On those issues, ``I feel comfortable siding with the mothers
and fathers in this district rather than the NRA,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In 1991, Edwards' district was the scene of the largest mass
murder in the nation's history when a gunman killed 22 people at a
Luby's cafeteria in Killeen.
</P>
<P>
   The day after the massacre, Congress was scheduled to vote on a
sweeping ban on several types of firearms.
</P>
<P>
   ``It caused me to search my conscience. What did I truly feel
was the right thing to do?'' Edwards said.
</P>
<P>
   He decided to vote in favor of banning 19 types of assault
weapons.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're not used by hunters or families but were used,
according to the FBI, by thugs, and drug dealers and organized
criminals to efficiently kill people,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   While Edwards is considered a moderate Democrat in Congress, his
East Texas colleagues _ Sandlin, Hall and Turner _ are more
conservative. All three belong to the Blue Dog Caucus, a group of
Democrats who tend to cast conservative votes on taxes, budgets and
other issues.
</P>
<P>
   Their opposition to several gun control proposals could prove a
key element in upcoming House debates.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll be a very important cog,'' said Sandlin. ``With a close
vote, I think it's very clear that the Texans _ especially the Blue
Dogs _ will vote pro-constitution, pro-gun and hopefully, that will
make the difference.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, gun control took the spotlight in Congress after
Columbine High School students Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold
horrified the nation by using high-powered guns to murder 12
students and a teacher before killing themselves.
</P>
<P>
   The tragedy and other highly-publicized school shootings had a
great impact on the public and lawmakers despite the fact that gun
homicides have dropped over the past few years.
</P>
<P>
   According to the U.S. Bureau of Justice Statistics, gun
homicides in the United States dropped from 14,740 in 1995 to
10,976 in 1998. Homicides committed by teens between the ages of 14
and 17 also dropped from 2,692 in 1995 to 1,433 in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Gun control proponents argue that the numbers are still
staggering and that gun violence will only drop significantly when
the number of firearms is reduced.
</P>
<P>
   A month after the Columbine shooting, the Senate stunned the
powerful gun lobby and voted for a juvenile justice bill which
included stricter background checks on buyers at gun shows. The
50-50 vote allowed Vice President Al Gore to cast an unusual
tie-breaking vote. Both Texas senators opposed the measure.
</P>
<P>
   For months, the bill has been stuck in a House-Senate conference
committee that is trying to resolve differences. Last week,
Republicans said they are considering stripping the bill of the
controversial gun control provisions in an effort to pass the
underlying $1.5 billion bill, which would impose stiffer penalties
on teens convicted of weapons crimes, as well as allow state
governments to post the Ten Commandments in public buildings.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Senate Democrats are expected to offer gun
control amendments to one of 13 pending appropriations bills
although the details are still unclear.
</P>
<P>
   Gun control advocates and most Democrats say that the GOP will
get hammered at the polls if it fails to pass some form of gun
control.
</P>
<P>
   But some Texas Democrats wouldn't mind that at all _ especially
if lawmakers dump a proposed 72-hour waiting period to purchase
firearms at gun shows .
</P>
<P>
   The gun show waiting period is probably the most controversial
gun control provision this year. Some lawmakers are proposing a
shorter one-day wait while others, like Sandlin, prefer some kind
of instant check.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton weighed in on the issue earlier this month, saying that
the waiting period is necessary to provide a ``cooling-off period''
for somebody ``who is really hot'' and ``buys a gun with a bad
intent.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Clinton said the waiting period must be long enough
to allow gun sellers to make the checks.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you move away from 72 hours to a shorter period, then the
question is, since so many of these gun shows occur on the weekend,
will there be access to the records to do the check,'' Clinton
said.
</P>
<P>
   In response to that dilemma, Sandlin said, ``I don't believe
that we trample on the Constitution because someone may be out of
pocket on the weekend.''
</P>
<P>
   Edwards disagrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not want my family or any other family in Central Texas
exposed to a murderer who has gotten out of prison and goes to a
gun show and buys as many guns as he can afford without a criminal
background check,'' Edwards said.
</P>
<P>
   In light of their opposition to gun control proposals, Sandlin,
Hall and Turner are among the Democrats who receive campaign
contributions from the NRA.
</P>
<P>
   In the two years leading up to his 1998 election, Sandlin
received $14,400 from the NRA. That was more than any other Texas
House member, including powerful Republicans such as Majority
Leader Dick Armey of Irving and Majority Whip Tom Delay of Sugar
Land, who each received $9,900 from the group.
</P>
<P>
   Turner and Hall also benefit from NRA dollars. Turner received
$9,900 from the group in the last election cycle and has received
$4,950 for his latest reelection bid. Hall received $3,500 last
time and at least $2,000 for this year's election. Sandlin's
coffers include $3,000 in NRA contributions for his latest race.
</P>
<P>
   Much like the NRA, Turner believes that the solution to gun
violence lies in enforcing current laws instead of creating new
ones.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we could get the guns out of the hands of convicted felons
who are walking around on parole and on probation in this country,
we would eliminate a lot of the problems that we're seeing with
regard to gun violence,'' he said. ``The law already prohibits
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Edwards declined to comment on the opinions of his East Texas
colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll let them speak for themselves,'' he said.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton keeps talking about guns.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past few weeks, the White House has discussed gun
shows, gun locks, gun clips, gun dealers, gun tracing, gun
licenses, gun accidents, gun prosecutions, gun safety courses, guns
in schools and guns in public housing.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has spoken about the recent shooting deaths of high
schoolers in Washington, D.C. and in Littleton, Colo. He honored
Jim Brady, who suffered a gunshot wound to the head in the 1981
attempted assassination of President Reagan. And in his State of
the Union address last month, Clinton invited the Colorado father
of a victim of the Columbine High School massacre as his personal
guest.
</P>
<P>
   Some would call it a full court press. With less than a year
left in his presidency, Clinton is pushing hard for ``common
sense'' gun control measures.
</P>
<P>
   But some North Carolina lawmakers don't see any ``common sense''
in the proposals.
</P>
<P>
   ``People in my district have great respect for the Bible and
Constitution,'' said GOP Rep. Walter Jones. ``They have the belief
that if they are law-abiding citizens they have the right to
purchase a gun and hunt.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones said he does not think he could support the president's
proposal to require background checks at gun shows or to require
safety locks on handguns.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hate to say it, but I have to be very leery of any proposal
from this administration. I think too many times these proposals
are made for political gain,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Jones, who represents a largely rural district, said his
constituents are very worried about gun control and believe the
proposals punish honest citizens.
</P>
<P>
   In some states, such as North Carolina and Texas, several
Democrats are also concerned about Clinton's gun control wish list.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Bob Etheridge, D-N.C., said current gun laws need to be
enforced before adopting new legislation _ a mantra commonly cited
by the National Rifle Association.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our first and best option is enforcing the laws on the
books,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Guns should be kept away from children, from criminals and out
of schools, he said, adding that existing laws should be enough to
meet those goals.
</P>
<P>
   In that regard, the president's proposals to hire additional
Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (ATF) agents and make money
available to hire special gun prosecutors may be useful, Etheridge
said.
</P>
<P>
   However, many House members wonder if any gun issues will come
before the Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if in the climate of this year we feel confident
that the Republicans will take up the president's agenda,'' said
Etheridge spokesman Brad Woodhouse.
</P>
<P>
   Since action on Clinton's gun control agenda is unlikely,
Etheridge has not spent a lot of time thinking about requiring
safety locks on firearms or a ban on importing large capacity
ammunition clips or ``magazines,'' Woodhouse said.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, gun control took the spotlight in Congress after
Columbine High School students Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold
horrified the nation by using high-powered guns to murder 12
students and a teacher before killing themselves.
</P>
<P>
   The tragedy and other highly-publicized school shootings had a
great impact on the public and lawmakers despite the fact that gun
homicides have dropped over the past few years.
</P>
<P>
   According to the U.S. Bureau of Justice Statistics, gun
homicides in the United States dropped from 14,740 in 1995 to
10,976 in 1998. Homicides committed by teens between the ages of 14
and 17 also dropped from 2,692 in 1995 to 1,433 in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Gun control proponents argue that the numbers are still
staggering and that gun violence will only drop significantly when
the number of firearms is reduced.
</P>
<P>
   A month after the Columbine shooting, the Senate stunned the
powerful gun lobby and voted for a juvenile justice bill which
included stricter background checks on buyers at gun shows. The
50-50 vote allowed Vice President Al Gore to cast an unusual
tie-breaking vote.
</P>
<P>
   For months, the bill has been stuck in a House-Senate conference
committee that is trying to resolve differences. Last week,
Republicans said they are considering stripping the bill of the
controversial gun control provisions in an effort to pass the
underlying $1.5 billion bill, which would impose stiffer penalties
on teens convicted of weapons crimes, as well as allow state
governments to post the Ten Commandments in public buildings.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Senate Democrats are expected to offer gun
control amendments to one of 13 pending appropriations bills
although the details are still unclear.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Eva Clayton, D-N.C., said that some of Clinton's gun
proposals do have a chance of passing this year.
</P>
<P>
   Getting the Republican-led Congress to take up the president's
gun control agenda will be tough, but not impossible, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would think because this is an important issue people will
want to appear to be responsible and some of this will be included
in the budgeting process,'' she said. The development of tracing
technology and hiring additional ATF agents and gun prosecutors
stand the best chance, she said. Clayton said she readily supports
Clinton's proposals to ban importing large capacity ammo clips,
require safety locks, set waiting periods for buyers and have
firearms registration.
</P>
<P>
   Her stand on gun control has not been popular with some of her
constituents, friends and family members who are either hunters or
gun owners.
</P>
<P>
   Clayton argues that no one complains about rights violations
when they are licensed to drive vehicles, to hunt or to perform
other tasks. So why should the licensing of firearms be a
constitutional violation, she asks.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I am at an airport there are security measures and if
something sounds then they floss me down with the (metal detector)
wand,'' she said. ``I may grumble but I realize it's for the safety
of others.''
</P>
<P>
   Gun control advocates and most Democrats say that the GOP will
get hammered at the polls if it fails to pass some form of gun
control.
</P>
<P>
   But some North Carolina House members wouldn't mind that at all
_ especially if lawmakers abandon a proposed 72-hour waiting period
to purchase firearms at gun shows.
</P>
<P>
   The gun show waiting period is probably the most controversial
gun control provision this year. Some lawmakers are proposing a
shorter one-day wait while others prefer some kind of instant
check.
</P>
<P>
   Common sense should prevail when writing any waiting period
legislation, Clayton said.
</P>
<P>
   Depending on location and available technology, some gun show
sellers may be able to perform 24 or 48 hour background checks
while others may need to wait longer, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Clayton also questions whether purchasers of shotguns and rifles
need the type of background examination a handgun purchaser would,
since handguns are used in the majority of violent gun crime.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton weighed in on the issue earlier this month, saying that
the waiting period is necessary to provide a ``cooling-off period''
for somebody ``who is really hot'' and ``buys a gun with a bad
intent.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Clinton said the waiting period must be long enough
to allow gun sellers to make the checks.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you move away from 72 hours to a shorter period, then the
question is, since so many of these gun shows occur on the weekend,
will there be access to the records to do the check,'' Clinton
said.
</P>
<P>
   Jones said he has attended several gun shows in Greenville and
Jacksonville. People there are collectors, not criminals, he said.
</P>
<P>
   In light of his views, Jones receives support from the National
Rifle Association, which contributed $6,000 to his 1998 campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Organizations on both sides of the gun control debate
contributed $41,800 to 1998 congressional candidates from North
Carolina, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, a
nonpartisan watchdog group that tabulates campaign finance reports.
</P>
<P>
   The NRA contributed $34,800 to eight candidates and Handgun
Control Inc., the nation's largest pro-gun control group,
contributed $7,000 to two candidates, including $3,000 to Clayton.
</P>
<P>
   Etheridge received no money from either side.
</P>
<P>
   So far, for this year's election, the NRA has spent $16,000 in
the state on congressional candidates and Handgun Control Inc. has
spent no money.

 &HT;    GUN GROUPS USE INTERNET SITES TO PROMOTE THEIR CAUSES
</HEADLINE>
 &HT;    With GUNS-CONGRESS 
 &HT;    For release Wednesday, Feb. 30 
 &HT;    By EUNICE MOSCOSO 
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The National Rifle Association, long known for its
formidable lobbying in Congress, has developed an equally
impressive Internet site.
</P>
<P>
   Hunters, collectors and gun enthusiasts of all kinds can browse
through dozens of links at www.nra.org _ to learn about gun safety
courses, gun-related legislation in Congress, NRA history and the
National Firearms Museum in Fairfax, Va.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the site has several shopping options for
``everything the Second Amendment enthusiast needs to show their
support,'' such as clothing, decals, bags and books. It even sells
bumper stickers that say ``My President is Charlton Heston'' _ a
reference to the acclaimed actor who currently heads the
organization.
</P>
<P>
   The site also offers a ``Bill of Rights pewter belt buckle,'' a
``ladies collegiate style ring with synthetic gemstones'' to
reflect a members' status, and an infant bib with a picture on it
of toy wooden blocks spelling ``NRA.''
</P>
<P>
   The site also includes information about gun safety education
for adults and children, including several programs featuring
cartoon mascot Eddie Eagle, who is never shown touching a firearm,
the site says.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the NRA points out that Eddie Eagle does not
promote firearm ownership or use and is not affiliated with any
firearm or ammunition manufacturers. On the site, law enforcement
agencies can order a costume of the brown and white bald eagle
mascot for $2,650.
</P>
<P>
   The NRA Website also offers details on making contributions
online, donating firearms, donating land or leaving a gift for the
NRA in a will. And it allows people to sign up for membership and
to send the group gun-related stories such as instances when ``a
child heeded Eddie Eagle's message and avoided potential danger.''
</P>
<P>
   Those on the other end of the gun-related political spectrum are
also taking to the Internet to further their cause.
</P>
<P>
   Handgun Control, Inc., the leading gun control advocate group,
has a site at www.handguncontrol.org _ with information on
legislation, lawsuits involving the gun industry and statistics on
gun violence.
</P>
<P>
   While far less polished and elaborate than the NRA site, the
Handgun Control page does have links to state and national gun
control groups and detailed information on federal and state gun
laws.
</P>
<P>
   It also sports several gun-related essays with titles such as
``the NRA's Second Amendment myth'' and ``Who needs an AK-47 to go
duck hunting?''
</P>
<P>
   There is, however, one common theme between the NRA Website and
that of Handgun Control, Inc. _ they are both decorated in
patriotic red, white and blue.

EDITORIAL: RISKS AND REALITIES IN CONGO 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Tuesday, Feb. 29:
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. Security Council gave its unanimous support last week
to an American-backed plan to send a peace-monitoring mission to
Congo. In principle, the decision is sound. The ruinous war there
must be brought to an end, and international engagement will be
essential to untangling a conflict that involves at least six
countries and multiple rebel groups and proxy militias. But the
dangers associated with the creation of a credible U.N. force are
daunting, and the Security Council is right to move ahead with
caution.
</P>
<P>
   This mission is not an attempt to impose a peace on unwilling
combatants, nor to disarm them. No outside force could impose a
peace on Congo's far-flung armies scattered across a territory the
size of Western Europe, much of it devoid of paved roads. The war
began in 1998 as a series of rebellions, backed by Uganda and
Rwanda, against the government of Laurent Kabila, who had ousted
the longtime despot Mobutu Sese Seko barely a year earlier. Angola,
Zimbabwe and Namibia soon came to Kabila's defense.
</P>
<P>
   The limited objective of the U.N. effort is to foster conditions
that will reinforce the will of these states to institute a peace
accord they signed last year in Lusaka, Zambia. All sides in the
war have violated the accord, but large parts of Congo are
relatively stable. Under the Security Council plan, a team of 500
U.N. observers, protected by 5,000 troops and support personnel,
would be sent to four strategic areas to document violations of the
cease-fire and to help arrange the movement of the various armies
and militias to defensive positions. The aim is to expand peaceful
areas and enhance trust on all sides.
</P>
<P>
   No American troops would be involved. The participants would be
recruited mostly from Africa and Asia. The mission carries a
start-up cost of $41 million, with America billed roughly
one-third.
</P>
<P>
   But even this limited plan involves considerable risks. Fighting
persists across much of the north and eastern Congo, and the
potential for renewed violence elsewhere is high. The good faith of
political and military leaders is far from certain, and many
combatants are motivated by the profits they are extracting from
Congo's lucrative gold, copper and diamond mining assets. There
remains the difficult problem of how to disarm the ethnic Hutu
militias and former army troops from Rwanda who found sanctuary in
Congo after participating in Rwanda's genocide in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Not least, there is a pattern of ill-defined and ineffective
peacekeeping missions that have undermined the U.N.'s credibility
in the past, from Somalia and Rwanda to Bosnia. The composition of
the Congo force is still in doubt, and there is a danger of a
poorly trained force under wobbly command that would be vulnerable
to attack by a larger force.
</P>
<P>
   Without effective international support for Congo's tenuous
peace accord there is every likelihood of a wider war. There is
reason to hope that the difficulties can be eased enough to create
acceptable circumstances for the U.N. mission to proceed. But the
U.N. must be sure that it is not embarking on a futile operation,
for a failed mission would be worse than no mission at all.

CARTER UNDER GLASS AND OVER THE TOP
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By RICHARD SANDOMIR   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NBC invited its new best friend, Vince Carter, Skywalker, to a
national party on Sunday. It was a belated invitation; NBC's
original schedule did not include the game between Carter's Toronto
Raptors and Phoenix. NBC placed it in the 12:30 p.m. slot earlier
this month, to be seen by parts of the country not slated to see
the Knicks play Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   After Carter's ineffable performance as a slam-dunker on Feb.
12, one day before the National Basketball Association All-Star
Game, NBC shifted the Toronto game to a national broadcast, moving
the Knicks into a regional slot at 3 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Having made the change, NBC repeatedly told viewers that this
was Carter's NBC national coming-out party. If ever you forgot the
day's significance, the announcers Tom Hammond and Steve Jones
offered these reminders:
</P>
<P>
   ``The royal vestments of Prince Vince await.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Vince Carter flexes his muscles on NBC for the first time.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You think he might know this is his NBC coming-out party?''
</P>
<P>
   Carter has not been ignored by national TV. The slam-dunk
contest was on TNT, which is available in 76 million cable homes.
TBS has carried one Toronto game this season (the 1.4 rating
equaled the network's average) with one more, on Monday, coming up.
TNT, TBS's sister network, has two Toronto games scheduled.
</P>
<P>
   So NBC threw Carter's biggest debutant ball, heralding,
fortuitously, a 51-point performance.
</P>
<P>
   Carter's play gives the NBA hope that he is the true successor
to Michael Jordan, providing a type of new Air transfusion that
``next Jordans'' like Grant Hill, Penny Hardaway and Kobe Bryant
have not.
</P>
<P>
   And NBC gave him the star treatment, which is hard to avoid
doing when the star is scoring 51.
</P>
<P>
   He starred in a 3-minute-50-second pregame feature (with baby
pictures and the illustration ``He's Half-Man, Half-Amazing,'' a
kind of hoops centaur). In an interview, Ahmad Rashad offered some
rare wit, telling Phoenix's Jason Kidd that with all the hype
around Carter, ``I didn't know you'd be here.''
</P>
<P>
   Enough about Vince. What about Vince?
</P>
<P>
   During the game, his name was uttered 165 times. NBC's cameras
found him 105 times for close-ups, replays, reaction shots, moments
when he was doing nothing, walking to and from the court or sitting
on the bench with a towel on his head. Total Prince Vince Face
Time: 12:39.
</P>
<P>
   When the second quarter ended, Rashad didn't interview Butch
Carter, the Raptors' head coach, or Scott Skiles, Phoenix's rookie
head coach. There was evidently no need to hear Skiles discuss how
to stop Carter. So there was Carter again, our newfound TV love,
questioned for 25 seconds. Has Rashad discovered a new pal for
pregame pajama parties?
</P>
<P>
   Carter worship reached its acme in the fourth quarter, when he
was mentioned 62 times, and the camera found him 38 times for 5:47
of Face Time. He was NBC's go-to guy for replays and five-replay
video montages. When another player's image was seen before NBC
went to commercials, it was a shock. To Hammond, Carter was
``Vin-credible.''
</P>
<P>
   Here's a freebie, Tom: Use ``con- &UR; vince- &LR; ing'' any time you
want.
</P>
<P>
   At the end, NBC showed Carter in five different ways, for 38
seconds, as Hammond said, ``Prince Vince celebrates a big-time
message victory.'' Rashad concluded NBC's royal anointment with 36
seconds of happy chat with Carter.
</P>
<P>
   As strongly as NBC pitched Carter, it couldn't force people to
watch. The overnight Nielsen rating proved that despite Carter's
skills, he is not yet a household name or a subject for appointment
viewing.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a beginning,'' said Ken Schanzer, the president of
NBC Sports. ``The one thing is people had to say, `Did you see what
Vince Carter did?' That's how it starts.''
</P>
<P>
   The 3.4 overnight rating was the lowest of NBC's tripleheader.
Granted 12:30 p.m. Eastern games usually suffer from the early
hour, but the rating never went past a 3.9 in any complete
half-hour.
</P>
<P>
   NBC filled its 3 o'clock slot by regionalizing the
Knicks-Philadelphia and Utah-Portland games, and earned a 4.6
rating. At 5:30, the regional combination of the Houston-Los
Angeles and San Antonio-Minnesota games yielded a 4.8.
</P>
<P>
   The tripleheader rated a cumulative 4.2, down 25 percent from
three games in the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
   Toronto games are a slight problem for NBC. Canadian ratings do
not count in U.S. calculations. No matter how big Carter gets, NBC
won't benefit from his home market. With 2.3 million households,
Toronto would be the sixth largest U.S. market, representing 2.3
percent of the country. Still, even a huge Toronto rating wouldn't
budge national ratings much.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a guy is transcendent, his impact will find its way to
increased ratings in all markets,'' Schanzer said. ``It's more
important to have a great talent than he be necessarily located in
one market.''
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's ratings winner was Tiger Woods, even in defeat at the
Andersen Consulting Match-Play Championship. As long as Woods looks
capable of winning, viewers respond. The tournament's 5.6 rating on
Sunday from 2 to 6 p.m. represented a 33 percent improvement from
1999. And it signifies the threat that a Woods-in-the-hunt
tournament poses to rival networks' programming.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's demonstrated enormous national appeal, like Jordan, and
he's drawing casual viewers to golf,'' Schanzer said.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately for NBC, it is carrying the next five PGA Tour
events.

MAYOR REACTS TO CRITICISM OF HIM OVER DIALLO CASE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By ELISABETH BUMILLER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ After three days of attacks from protesters and black
clergy infuriated by his defense of the police and the Amadou
Diallo verdicts, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani fought back Monday and
called remarks made by the Rev. Calvin Butts, his former ally,
``extremely political'' and ``hateful.''
</P>
<P>
   The mayor added that fears in the black community about police
brutality were not borne out by the facts and that New York City
police officers were ``a model of restraint.''
</P>
<P>
   In a sermon at the Abyssinian Baptist Church on Sunday, Butts
said that there was ``an evil that permeates the place called City
Hall'' and that Giuliani ``is simply reinforcing white supremacy''
in the city.
</P>
<P>
   ``The remarks were hateful, they were intended to divide and
they were extremely political,'' Giuliani said during a news
briefing Monday morning on the Lower East Side, where he also
criticized Butts for, in effect, endorsing his opponent, Hillary
Rodham Clinton, for U.S. Senate. Giuliani called Butts' remarks
against him ``a hate-filled attack on another candidate from the
pulpit of a church.''
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani's remarks were in sharp contrast to his conciliatory
statements on Friday expressing sympathy for Diallo's family after
the verdicts acquitting the four white officers were announced. On
Monday the mayor said repeatedly that his critics were prejudiced,
that criticism of the police was unfair and that he was proud of
the way he and Police Commissioner Howard Safir had handled a case
that had clouded his administration for more than a year.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor also said that he had reached out to the city's black
community in ``a hundred hours of meetings'' since the killing last
February of Diallo, an unarmed African immigrant.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the city's black leaders disputed his version, saying
that Giuliani agreed to see them only under pressure more than six
weeks after Diallo's death _ when civil rights demonstrations
against the shooting were growing daily at police headquarters _
and that they had not met with him since.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has been no regular dialogue and interaction between the
mayor and myself,'' said C. Virginia Fields, the Manhattan borough
president.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Charles Rangel of Harlem, the dean of New York's
congressional delegation, said Monday that Giuliani came to see him
in his office immediately after Giuliani was elected mayor in 1993,
promising that the two would work together, but that he had not
been back since.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the mayor has missed one great opportunity to bring
some healing to a city that is polarized,'' Rangel said, adding
that Giuliani needed to give assurances that a killing like
Diallo's ``would never, ever, ever happen again.''
</P>
<P>
   Rangel, a Democrat who was among the first to urge Clinton to
run for the Senate seat, said that the mayor had isolated himself
from the city's black community and did not understand its anger.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   On Friday, the mayor expressed extremely personal sentiments,
noting in a soft voice that there was nothing worse for a parent
than the death of a child. But on Monday, the mayor, a former U.S.
attorney for the Southern District of New York, seemed to pride
himself on what he described as his rational, unemotional response
to reporters' questions.
</P>
<P>
   When Gabe Pressman, a political reporter at WNBC-TV, asked
whether there was something wrong with a system that led to a
killing like Diallo's, Giuliani said: ``You have to look at, is
this actually systemic? Systemic means something more than just
prejudicial emotion. It means something logical.''
</P>
<P>
   Later he said, ``If you're asking me to respond as an
intelligent, caring individual, I have to give an intelligent
response, not just a sort of prejudiced, emotional response.''
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani added that police killings of innocent victims happened
less often now than when he took office _ statistics show that New
York City police officers fire their weapons less often at suspects
than do officers in many other large police departments _ and that
``the real risk that we face in this city is from other citizens of
the city, not from the New York Police Department.''

ERSTAD INTERESTS YANKEES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 c.2000 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPE, Ariz. _ The New York Yankees, looking for a left-
handed-hitting left fielder, have turned their attention to the
Angels' Darin Erstad.
</P>
<P>
   According to a New York Times report, a Yankees official said
the club can make a deal now but would have to give up highly
touted prospect Alfonso Soriano, a shortstop, and left fielder
Ricky Ledee. The Yankees initially said no.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees, though, remain interested in Erstad and are talking
with the Angels, even though Erstad has struggled since making the
All-Star team in 1998. Last season, Erstad hit just .253 with 13
homers and 53 RBI. His lifetime average is .282.
</P>
<P>
   What the Yankees like about Erstad, 25, is his attitude and his
hard-nosed approach, much like they have in right fielder Paul
O'Neill. The Yankees had been talking to the Angels about Jim
Edmonds, but the two sides could not agree on a return package to
the Angels.
</P>
<P>
   Angels general manager Bill Stoneman will not speak on trade
speculation.
</P>
<P>
   __ Back to Phillies: The Angels are faced with an interesting
situation regarding 22-year-old pitcher Derrick Turnbow. Turnbow
was acquired by the Angels in December in the Rule V draft from the
Phillies.
</P>
<P>
   If he does not make the 25-man roster to begin the season, the
Angels by rule must then offer him back to the Phillies. If the
Phillies don't take him back, he must clear waivers _ meaning every
team has an oppotunity to claim him _ before the Angels can then
reclaim him.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels feel Turnbow could be special _ he has a fastball
clocked in the low 90's _ but they know it will be difficult to
find a spot on the staff for him. One option would be to go to a
12-man staff, but Turnbow's opportunities would be limited and his
development would be slowed.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's got a great arm,'' manager Mike Scioscia said. ''You
really like to have a guy like that in your organization, but you
have to evaluate the cost of it.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Early rotation: The Angels will hold an intrasquad game this
afternoon. Ramon Ortiz will start against Ken Hill and they will
pitch one inning each. Scott Schoeneweis will start Wednesday
night's game against Arizona State, and Jarrod Washburn is
tenatively slated to start the Angels' Cactus League opener Friday
against Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   __ Notes: Tim Salmon was excused from Monday's workout so he
could attend the funeral of his grandmother. He is expected back
today. . . . The Angels signed catcher Bengie Molina, pitcher Lou
Pote, outfielder Norm Hutchins and first baseman Larry Barnes for
the 2000 season.

POLL FINDS THAT HALF IN STATE DISAGREE WITH DIALLO VERDICT 
</HEADLINE>
  (With NY-DIALLO-PROSECUTOR and related stories.)

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Half of all adults in New York state disagree with
the verdict acquitting four New York City police officers in the
shooting death of Amadou Diallo, according to the latest New York
Times/CBS News Poll.
</P>
<P>
   The Albany, N.Y., trial over the shooting of Diallo, an unarmed
immigrant from Guinea who was fired on 41 times in the vestibule of
his apartment building in the Bronx, received a great deal of
attention, according to the poll.
</P>
<P>
   Almost three-quarters of New Yorkers statewide followed the
case, 28 percent very closely and 44 percent somewhat closely.
Forty-five percent of black New Yorkers said they had followed the
case very closely.
</P>
<P>
   More than 80 percent of the respondents polled Saturday and
Sunday had already heard about the verdict on Friday in the Diallo
trial. The telephone survey was conducted with 911 adults
throughout New York state and has a sampling error of plus or minus
3 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, 50 percent disapprove of the jury's not-guilty verdict
for the four officers, Sean Carroll, Edward McMellon, Kenneth Boss
and Richard Murphy, while 30 percent agree with the verdict and 20
percent are undecided.
</P>
<P>
   White New Yorkers are divided in their assessment of the
verdict, while blacks throughout the state overwhelmingly disagree
with the jury's decision to clear the four white officers on all
charges. More than three-quarters of blacks statewide consider the
verdict wrong. Forty percent of whites agree with it.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the wide disparity between whites and blacks,
there are smaller differences in the reactions of men and women,
younger and older people and New York City residents and people who
live outside the city.
</P>
<P>
   Younger New Yorkers are much more likely to disagree with the
verdict. While 60 percent of people under 30 consider the acquittal
wrong, people age 65 and older are closely split: 41 percent of
them said it was correct to clear the officers of all charges and
37 percent said it was wrong. Most women oppose the verdict, but
men are more divided. Fifty-five percent of women oppose the
verdict, as do 44 percent of men.
</P>
<P>
   Residents of New York City are more inclined to regard the
verdict as wrong, while people who live in the suburbs and upstate
are closely divided. Sixty percent of people living in New York
City say the jury reached the wrong verdict, compared with 43
percent of people living in the rest of the state.

RADIOACTIVE CONTAMINATION IN STUDENT COUPLE'S ROOM BAFFLES
COLUMBIA  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By ANDREW C. REVKIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It is a puzzle baffling enough to furrow the brow of
scholarly types, and serious enough to raise concerns of New York
City and federal officials about a lapse in security at biological
research laboratories using nuclear materials.
</P>
<P>
   Somehow, several weeks ago, a highly radioactive stain of
phosphorus-32 ended up on a pillow belonging to a young married
couple in Manhattan. The couple are graduate students at Columbia
University, she a doctoral candidate in biology, he is pursuing a
doctorate in computer science.
</P>
<P>
   The husband and wife, Lei Liu and Yao Cheng, who met at Columbia
while on student visas from China, said in interviews Monday and in
briefings with investigators that they had reported the suspicious
radiation in their university-owned apartment at 542 West 112th
Street, and that they had had nothing to do with the radioactive
material found there.
</P>
<P>
   But Columbia's radiation safety inspectors and radiation experts
at the New York City Health Department suspect otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   According to identical letters sent by the university
administration to the couple on Feb. 24, the students have been
barred from the campus and suspended because an investigation
determined that they ``appear to have some responsibility for the
radiation incident.''
</P>
<P>
   The letters and a Feb. 21 report on the radiation stain by the
university's office of environmental health and radiation safety
have been distributed widely within the university administration.
Copies were provided to the city's Health Department, which is
responsible for investigating releases of radiation.
</P>
<P>
   Columbia officials said there was no indication that the couple
or anyone else was harmed by the phosphorus-32, which is widely
used to diagnose and treat certain diseases and in biology
experiments to mark cells or bits of genetic material. The pillow
was removed two weeks ago, and the apartment has since been
inspected several times with no new signs of radiation, Columbia
officials said. Only very low levels of contamination were found on
Cheng and Liu, officials said: traces of phosphorus-32 on their
hands and hair, and on Cheng's chin.
</P>
<P>
   In the report, Columbia's investigators concluded that the stain
must have been intentionally deposited on the pillow, that the
phosphorus was too highly concentrated to have been a result of
some unknowing swipe by a contaminated hand, for example. The
report also noted that the lack of any other similarly tainted
places in the apartment suggested that no one had touched the
pillow after it had been contaminated.
</P>
<P>
   The report concluded: ``The amount of contamination on the
pillowcase immediately raised the suspicion that the contamination
was not an accidental event, but rather the result of a deliberate
act.''
</P>
<P>
   Sandra Mullin, a spokeswoman for the Health Department, said,
``What we found is very consistent with Columbia's own
investigation.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though phosphorus-32 cannot legally be possessed by someone
without a Health Department license for radioactive materials, the
department has not referred the case to prosecutors or the police,
while the university continues with its inquiry, Mullin said.
</P>
<P>
   Cheng and Liu say they have done nothing wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never brought radioactive substances home, and we don't know
how the pillow became radioactive,'' said Cheng, sitting in the
couple's apartment in a 10-story dormitory. The university has not
asked them to move.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to continue my studies,'' Liu said, adding, ``I don't
want to upset the university.''
</P>
<P>
   University officials have yet to find any reason or opportunity
for someone other than the couple to have put the material on the
pillow, said Virgil Renzulli, a spokesman for Columbia. ``How do
you get it into a locked apartment?'' he asked.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The incident began to unfold on Feb. 8, according to the report
by Columbia's environmental health and radiation safety department.
On that day, a routine check after Cheng did some laboratory work
showed she had slight contamination on her hands and chin, and on
one spot on her hair.
</P>
<P>
   The report said she worked in a complex of laboratories in the
Fairchild building at the north end of Columbia's main campus. She
worked on a floor where phosphorus-32 is used in many experiments,
so many that new sets of vials are ordered every week, said one
official involved in the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   The day after the routine tests showed some contamination, the
report said, Cheng borrowed a laboratory Geiger counter and scanned
her apartment, where she told investigators she found that one spot
on one pillow was ``very hot.''
</P>
<P>
   Follow-up tests by radiation specialists from the university and
the city's Health Department confirmed that one spot on the surface
of a pillow was very radioactive.
</P>
<P>
   Phosphorus-32 used in biological work is stored in a liquid
solution in vials typically holding 0.25 milliliters of the
isotope, and investigators have estimated that the contents of one
vial were poured onto the pillow.
</P>
<P>
   The stain was emitting radioactivity at 200 millirems an hour,
said officials involved in the investigation. The normal background
level of radiation, which varies by altitude, averages about 0.02
millirems an hour in New York, one ten-thousandth of the amount
radiating from the surface of the pillow. That average totals 175
millirems a year. The acceptable safe limit for the public is 100
millirems a year above that, according to federal health officials.
</P>
<P>
   Columbia officials said Monday that they were certain that the
material could not have come from Yao Cheng's laboratory, where an
inventory turned up no shortages.
</P>
<P>
   Some residents and workers in the Columbia dorm were disturbed
to hear that an apartment there had been tainted with
radioactivity. ``I am reporting this to my union right now,'' said
the building superintendent, Rudy Hamarik, 48, who has worked in
the dorm for 23 years.

MAN SAYS MURDER SUSPECTS DISCUSSED DUMPING A BODY
</HEADLINE>
 
 (ATTN: Fla.)  (nk) 
 By JULIAN E. BARNES   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A man who said he was mistreated by the mother and
son accused of killing an Upper East Side woman testified Monday
that the pair stopped on a New Jersey roadside on their way to New
York and discussed disposing of a dead body.
</P>
<P>
   The witness, Jose A. Alvarez, said he began working for Sante
and Kenneth Kimes in Florida on May 13, 1998, and the three of them
left for New York a month later. As they neared New York on the
second day of the trip, Kimes pulled the car to the side of the
road.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were talking about how this was a perfect place to dump a
body, because the police would never find it there,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Kimes first pointed out the site to his mother and then turned
to the backseat where Alvarez had been sleeping and told him, in
Spanish, about the spot, Alvarez testified.
</P>
<P>
   The Kimeses are accused of concocting a scheme to steal the
Upper East Side town house of Irene Silverman, who disappeared on
July 5, 1998, killing her, and then disposing of her body, which
has never been found. On the witness stand Monday, Alvarez did not
identify the precise location in New Jersey where Kimes discussed
dumping a body. But after the police first interviewed Alvarez in
August 1998, investigators unsuccessfully searched an overgrown
field on the outskirts of Jersey City, N.J., for the body.
</P>
<P>
   Alvarez, 26, testified that when he began working for the
Kimeses, the three of them stayed at the Palm Beach Polo and
Country Club in Wellington, Fla. Alvarez testified that he found a
gun under the pillow of the bed that Mrs. Kimes shared with her
son.
</P>
<P>
   Alvarez also testified that once they arrived in New York, the
Kimeses continued to share a bed in the apartment Kimes rented in
Silverman's town house.
</P>
<P>
   Once inside the apartment, Alvarez testified that the Kimeses
stationed him by the apartment door and told him to look through
the peephole, watch the security camera monitor and take notes on
who entered and left the building. But after four days of sneaking
in and out with Kimes, hiding from visitors in the kitchen and
standing for hours in front of the peephole, Alvarez said he
decided to leave.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were bothering me and they didn't want to pay me,''
Alvarez said. ``They had me there as a slave.''
</P>
<P>
   Alvarez said that after he took a job with the Kimeses, he
signed a contract that he said was written by Mrs. Kimes. The
contract, which was introduced into evidence, said Alvarez would
work in return for room and board only. Alvarez, who is originally
from Cuba, said he does not read any English and was told by the
Kimeses that he would be paid at least $350 a week. Alvarez said he
still has not been paid.
</P>
<P>
   In 1986, Mrs. Kimes was convicted of federal slavery charges for
enticing young women from Mexico to come work for her, refusing to
pay them and preventing them from leaving. Mrs. Kimes served three
years of a five-year prison sentence.
</P>
<P>
   Alvarez said he fled into Central Park and stayed there for
three and half days, until he ran into Kimes.
</P>
<P>
   Kimes asked Alvarez to return to work and told him that he and
his mother were planning to leave shortly for Canada, Alvarez said.
Alvarez refused and asked again to be paid. Kimes gave him $30,
which Alvarez used to take a bus to New Jersey to cash a check from
a previous employer. With that money, Alvarez bought a bus ticket
to Miami.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the gun, prosecutors had Alvarez identify a knife
and brass knuckles as belonging to Kimes. Out of the presence of
the jury, Michael A. Hardy, a lawyer for Mrs. Kimes, objected to
the prosecution trying to introduce the weapons into evidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Circumstantial evidence is circumstantial evidence, garbage is
garbage,'' Hardy said. ``And we are in the garbage stage now.''
</P>
<P>
   Defense lawyers are to cross-examine Alvarez Tuesday.

INTERNET SPURS HUGE JOB GROWTH IN NEW YORK AREA 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By TERRY PRISTIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Internet-related jobs in the New York area are
growing at an explosive rate, to 250,000 now from 106,000 in 1997,
and are responsible for an $8.3 billion payroll that has tripled
during that period, according to an industry-sponsored survey
released Monday.
</P>
<P>
   In New York City, the growth in new-media jobs is outpacing that
of traditional media companies and other key industries, the survey
showed. It was commissioned by the New York New Media Association,
a trade group, and conducted by PricewaterhouseCoopers, the
accounting firm.
</P>
<P>
   The survey defined New York's $9.2 billion new-media business as
a broad category encompassing Internet-related jobs in publishing,
advertising, telecommunications and software design as well as
newer dot-com companies. In more than half of the 8,534 companies
included in the survey, the core business did not involve the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   As the home to more than a third of these companies (3,148, up
from 2,128), Manhattan remains dominant in this industry. But these
businesses are proliferating at a faster rate in New Jersey _ to
2,398 today from 974 three years ago, the survey said. Nearly half
operate in more than one location. About 1,700 companies in the
survey had moved to New York during the last three years.
</P>
<P>
   In perhaps the survey's most surprising finding, 60 percent of
the companies said they showed a profit in 1998. These tended to be
smaller companies that design Web sites and provide other services
to high-profile companies that are spending heavily to develop a
brand, said Brian Horey, the president of Equity Growth Management,
a venture capital company, and a founder of the New York New Media
Association. Indeed, more than half of the companies reporting
profits said they made less than $1 million.
</P>
<P>
   The creation of new jobs has not closed the racial and gender
gap, however, even in this tight labor market. The Internet work
force in New York is overwhelmingly white (74 percent) and male (62
percent), but not as young as it is in the popular imagination.
According to the survey, the average age is 35, with 33 percent
younger than 30 and 29 percent older than 40. Of the 249,639 jobs
identified in the survey, 185,617 were full-time positions, a big
increase from 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Another change since then, said Alice Rodd O'Rourke, the
executive director of the New York New Media Association, is that
the industry no longer feels it is being ignored. ``People are more
optimistic, more positive, about the role that government has
played,'' she said. As one example, she cited Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani's proposal to repeal the commercial rent tax.
</P>
<P>
   Although the survey does not compare geographical regions _ or
make special claims for New York _ Horey said the region leads the
nation in creating material for the Web.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there's no question that we're the primary hub for
content,'' he said. ``The West Coast is the hub for infrastructure
and technology.''
</P>
<P>
   But in a more skeptical report issued in October 1998, the
Federal Reserve Bank of New York said that it might be premature to
declare that New York is a new-media hub.
</P>
<P>
   The phenomenal expansion may just represent a shift in the way
traditional media companies are operating. ``Accordingly,'' that
report said, ``one could argue that New York City's new-media boom
essentially reflects an Internet-technology-driven boom in the
city's traditional media industries _ industries that represent a
large share of the city's economy.''
</P>
<P>
   Jason Bram, an economist and one of the authors of the Federal
Reserve Bank's report, said New York's Internet role should not be
overstated. ``For years and years, New York City has traditionally
been behind the nation in new media, but we're sort of catching
up,'' he said. ``Maybe we are ahead, in the overall scheme of
things, but we're not Silicon Valley.''

NO MORE CHANTING, NO MORE TOMORROWS
</HEADLINE>
  (With BBO-YANKS-STRAWBERRY) 
(nk) 
 By JACK CURRY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TAMPA, Fla. _ It was a warm September evening in 1990 and Darryl
Strawberry had just sent everyone home from Shea Stadium with a
titanic two-run homer off Lee Smith. After missing the press
elevator, I tried to hustle down to the clubhouse to interview
Strawberry and ran into every Darryl fan in Flushing clogging the
runways, screaming his name and making it impossible to budge.
</P>
<P>
   No one ever wanted to leave the seats when Strawberry was
hitting. Fresh beers could wait. So could trips to the bathroom.
But these fans did not want to leave afterward, either. They
chanted ``Darryl, Darryl,'' holding on to the moment as if it was
theirs, because it was.
</P>
<P>
   It was a sunny afternoon last November and a weeping Strawberry
was standing behind a lectern at City Hall. A Yankee now, he was
thanking Manager Joe Torre for being supportive during a trying
year in which Strawberry had been arrested, and his words turned
into sobs. The fans slowly serenaded him with ``Darryl, Darryl,'' a
classy gesture. Torre jumped out of his seat and cradled
Strawberry, patting him on the chest the way a father would calm a
newborn.
</P>
<P>
   It was quiet at Legends Field on Monday, the day Strawberry was
suspended from baseball for a year, an action that could bring a
depressing end to his career. The field was empty one hour after a
trivial intrasquad game. No one chanted anything.
</P>
<P>
   Word of Strawberry's impending suspension had been floating
around all afternoon, but the official news came when Yankee
interns put news releases on laptop computers throughout the press
box. Three paragraphs later, Strawberry, as central a figure as any
athlete in New York sports in the last two decades, was gone.
</P>
<P>
   He was supposed to be the next Ted Williams. He was supposed to
coast from Compton to Cooperstown. He was supposed to treat the
baseball world to years and years of power and panache. Instead,
Darryl was bounced out of baseball for the third time after 15
unforgettable seasons, countless questions hovering over his bald
head. What if? The questions will never leave Strawberry. What
could Darryl have been?
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't know what that is,'' a subdued Torre said.
``Obviously having his career interrupted brings up that question,
how much more he could have done in his career. There could have
been some records that could have fallen if he had played from
start to finish and was available every inning of every day.''
</P>
<P>
   Keith Hernandez was sitting on a container of baseballs in Port
St. Lucie, Fla., on Sunday when he was quizzed about Strawberry. He
lowered his head, struggled for the proper words and was silent for
several seconds. Hernandez fought with Strawberry during Mets
picture day 12 years ago, but now he called him a friend and an
incredible athlete. An athlete whose career needed life support too
many times.
</P>
<P>
   ``He should have been a 500-plus home run guy,'' Hernandez said.
``It just didn't work out that way. The two greatest young players
I ever saw were Darryl Strawberry and Garry Templeton, and both
squandered it.''
</P>
<P>
   Darryl Eugene Strawberry was the first player chosen in the 1980
amateur draft, and he has been in the spotlight ever since, mainly
in New York. Sometimes moody, often rowdy and always interesting
with the Mets, he was the player we wanted to watch because his
sweet swing produced 400-foot homers.
</P>
<P>
   Strawberry was 21 years old when the Mets summoned him in 1983,
a power hitter so fearsome that Frank Howard, then the Mets'
manager, who had 382 homers of his own, said, ``If we're wrong
about this guy, we better all hang it up.''
</P>
<P>
   Technically, no one was wrong, since Darryl made it, belting 252
homers in 8 years and winning a World Series ring with the Mets in
1986. Darryl signed a $20 million free-agent deal with the Los
Angeles Dodgers before the 1991 season, went home and made foolish
choices.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't ever think Darryl was innocent,'' Hernandez said. ``He
was streetwise. He was not naive.''
</P>
<P>
   There was a stunning rebirth on the Yankees for Strawberry,
starting in 1995. The next year Torre did not want him on the team,
but the Yankees' principal owner, George Steinbrenner, turned into
Strawberry's savior and forced him onto a strong club on July 4.
Steinbrenner warned Strawberry never to cross him by abusing drugs
or alcohol, which the soon-to-be 38-year-old has done twice in the
last 10 months. Even Strawberry's teammates feel it is essential
for him to worry about his life, not his career.
</P>
<P>
   All was quiet here an hour after the announcement that probably
squashed Strawberry's career. When a phone call was placed to
Strawberry's house Monday, Charisse, his wife, answered with a
quivering voice. She quickly said she could not comment.
</P>
<P>
   No one chanted for Darryl. Most likely, Strawberry's career and
the ``Darryl, Darryl'' chants died with Monday's decision. The
final memory could be the worst one.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's unfortunate we didn't get to see him play enough in his
career,'' Torre said. ``I think it was a disservice to him and to
the sport because of what he had to offer.'' &QL;

EARLY TEST SPOTS TUBE CRACK AT NUCLEAR PLANT THAT LEAKED 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By DAVID W. CHEN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WHITE PLAINS, N.Y. _ A preliminary inquiry into a radiation leak
this month at the Indian Point 2 nuclear plant suggests that a
single crack in a steam-generator tube was responsible,
Consolidated Edison officials said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Tests conducted over the weekend gave no hint of why the leak
occurred, or whether the crack was part of a larger problem, the
officials said. But if further tests conclude that the radiation
escaped from only one tube and there are no other surprises or
problems, the officials said, Con Edison may be inclined to reopen
the plant and not shut it, as some local officials and residents
have urged.
</P>
<P>
   ``The more we understand about the leak, the better off we are
from an ability to suggest appropriate repair options,'' said
Stephen Quinn, a Con Edison vice president who once managed the
plant.
</P>
<P>
   The Feb. 15 leak at the plant in Buchanan, about 35 miles north
of Manhattan, forced Con Edison, the plant's owner, to issue an
alert _ the second-lowest of four levels of nuclear emergency _ for
the first time since the plant opened in 1974. And although the
utility later insisted that no radiation ever escaped the plant and
that there was never any serious threat to public health, many
local residents were livid that they were not notified sooner.
</P>
<P>
   Not long before the incident, Con Edison had proposed selling
the plant, prompting some longtime opponents of nuclear power to
argue that the utility was more concerned about profits than
safety.
</P>
<P>
   Indian Point 2 has four steam generators, all of which have been
in place since the plant opened. Normally, clean water is pumped
into the generators, where the water is heated by super-hot tubes
holding radioactive fuel and turned into steam, which then runs the
turbines that generate the electricity.
</P>
<P>
   But on Feb. 15, one of the more than 3,000 tubes inside the
generator cracked, allowing radioactively contaminated water to mix
with clean water, according to the preliminary tests. Quinn said
that the size of the crack was not known yet, but that it was big
enough to allow 75 gallons per minute to escape, for a total of
perhaps 5,000 gallons.
</P>
<P>
   The tests were conducted over the weekend only at the one
generator that was known to have leaked, using eight cylindrical
robotic devices to check the tubes. The other three generators did
not leak, officials have said, but Quinn said that the many tests
to be conducted over the next few weeks would include checks of
those generators with the robots and with magnetic and fiber-optic
tests.
</P>
<P>
   Quinn sounded a bit relieved that only one crack was found, near
the top of the tube, which resembles an upside-down U, as opposed
to dozens of cracks in several tubes, which might suggest a larger
problem or a domino effect.
</P>
<P>
   ``As somebody that's looking for a needle in a haystack, it's
really nice when you find the needle,'' Quinn said. ``There's a
sense of relief, that OK, we found a leak, and it fits, kind of,
the profile we thought we would see.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and other
nuclear-energy analysts also will be looking at the test results.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's good that it was limited to one tube failing, but it's
bad that the tube failed at all,'' said David Lochbaum, a nuclear
safety engineer with the Union of Concerned Scientists, in
Washington. ``You're supposed to plug and replace these tubes
before they break, so it could mean that one cracked faster than
people thought. Or it could mean that the inspection process is not
rigorous enough to prevent the occasional failure.''

JOHN N. IRWIN II, FORMER AMBASSADOR, DIES AT 86 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By NICK RAVO   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   John Nichol Irwin II, a Manhattan lawyer and diplomat who served
under Gen. Douglas MacArthur during World War II and later became
ambassador to France, died on Monday at a hospital in New Haven,
Conn. He was 86.
</P>
<P>
   Irwin, who lived in New Canaan, Conn., held numerous government
positions starting in 1947, when he was appointed a member of the
staff of the joint Philippine-American Finance Commission during
the Truman administration.
</P>
<P>
   From 1958 to 1961, Irwin was deputy assistant secretary of
defense for international security affairs under President
Eisenhower. President Johnson appointed him as the U.S.
representative for Panama Canal negotiations from 1965 to 1968.
President Nixon appointed him as his envoy to Peru in a
nationalization dispute in 1969.
</P>
<P>
   Irwin was under secretary of state from 1970 to 1972 and deputy
secretary of state from 1972 to 1973. In 1973, he was appointed
ambassador to France, a position he held until the following year.
</P>
<P>
   He was awarded the Medal of Freedom by Nixon, and the Legion
d'Honneur by the French government.
</P>
<P>
   Irwin was born in Keokuk, Iowa, on Dec. 31, 1913 and graduated
from the Lawrenceville School and Princeton University. He received
a master's degree from Oxford University and a law degree from
Fordham University in 1941.
</P>
<P>
   During World War II, he served in the Army in the Pacific as a
member of MacArthur's staff and reached the rank of lieutenant
colonel. After the war, Irwin practiced law at two Manhattan firms.
</P>
<P>
   Irwin spent many years on the boards of directors of IBM and of
the U.S. Trust Co. He also was a trustee of the Lawrenceville
School, Princeton, the Wildlife Conservation Society, The
Metropolitan Museum of Art, The American Museum of Natural History,
Union Theological Seminary, the National Gallery of Art, and the
French American Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   His first wife, Jane, died in 1970. He is survived by his second
wife, also named Jane; a daughter, Jane W.I. Droppa of Ellicott
City, Md.; a son, John N. Irwin III of Greenwich, Conn.; three
stepsons: Watkins W. Reynolds III and Thomas B. Reynolds of Fort
Worth, Texas, and Carl D. Reimers III of Greenwich, Conn., and 12
grandchildren.

<TEXT>
<P>
   FRANKFURT, Germany _ It is not the future that worries
Rolf-Ernst Breuer, chairman of Deutsche Bank. It is the present.
</P>
<P>
   As chairman of one of the world's biggest banks, Breuer is
convinced that the World Wide Web will eviscerate traditional
banking _ but also open huge new opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, in a cavernous warehouse packed with video screens,
Breuer outlined a number of Web-based projects, from portals for
personal finance to electronic trading networks for steel and
chemicals.
</P>
<P>
   But in a wide-ranging interview in his office at the bank's
headquarters here, Breuer sounded like a man still trapped in
concrete.
</P>
<P>
   Deutsche Bank is struggling to be one of the top five banking
companies in the world, a position it can lay claim to by virtue of
its size, but one that will require big adjustments to the global
marketplace.
</P>
<P>
   Deutsche Bank has 1,500 local offices and 7 million retail
banking customers. It has the biggest branch network in Germany,
but that network barely ekes out a profit and consistently drags
down the bank's overall performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a problem which we cannot solve on a stand-alone
basis,'' he acknowledged bluntly, adding that customers flee as
soon as the bank closes branches. ``The only solution is to
consolidate, which means to go together with someone else and,
well, diminish overlaps.''
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, consolidation would have implied taking over a
rival. But now, Breuer is hinting at something more radical: the
possibility of giving up a controlling stake in his own branches.
</P>
<P>
   ``That depends on the partners,'' he said cagily, when asked
whether he could contemplate letting someone else have a
controlling stake.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is largely beyond Deutsche Bank's control. Germany
has far too many banks partly because it has a huge sector of
nonprofit savings banks owned by state and local governments, which
keep margins low.
</P>
<P>
   Having separated Deutsche Bank's retail network into a
stand-alone company called Deutsche Bank 24, Breuer has pleaded in
vain for rivals to buy in as minority partners.
</P>
<P>
   Few analysts say Deutsche Bank will simply sell off its branch
network. But Breuer is clearly impatient and also seems convinced
that traditional banking is withering and radical changes are
necessary to survive.
</P>
<P>
   ``Deutsche Bank is a lot like Germany,'' said an executive at
one of its rivals in investment banking. ``It moves slowly for a
long time, but when it does decide to change, it moves incredibly
quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   Outlining his strategy for electronic banking, Breuer argued
that the Internet would cannibalize conventional banking channels
and lead to a drastic reduction of profit margins in routine
businesses.
</P>
<P>
   But, Breuer added, the Internet also opens up new opportunities
for geographic expansion across Europe without buying physical
businesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two years ago, if someone had come and offered me the Credit
Lyonnais on a plate, I would have been interested,'' he remarked.
``But today, I would say no, that's duplicating a problem we have
already in Germany.''
</P>
<P>
   France is now a model for building up a virtual market across
Europe. Blocked by French political leaders from buying a French
bank, Breuer set up a skeleton network of offices that cater only
to wealthy customers and rely primarily on electronic services.
</P>
<P>
   Breuer, who took over as chief executive three years ago, knows
he is under pressure. He acknowledges that he is far behind rivals
like Goldman, Sachs and Morgan Stanley Dean Witter as an adviser in
mergers and acquisitions. Even in the German market, Deutsche Bank
has consistently ranked behind both American rivals in making
deals.
</P>
<P>
   He is also behind in electronic banking. Not only is Deutsche
Bank well behind American online brokers like Charles Schwab, it
also has fewer brokerage customers than German rivals like
Commerzbank and ConSors.
</P>
<P>
   At the moment, Deutsche Bank has only 125,000 online brokerage
customers, compared with about 300,000 for ComDirect, a unit of
Commerzbank, and 176,000 for ConSors, an online start-up that has
been one of Germany's hottest stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Despite some tardiness, Breuer now seems determined. He plans to
invest $300 million in Internet projects this year. He also
hammered out alliances with America Online and Europe's biggest
software company, SAP.
</P>
<P>
   In the deal with SAP, Deutsche Bank plans to set up virtual
marketplaces for corporations to trade products like chemicals and
steel.
</P>
<P>
   It is also setting up a number new portal sites that offer
access to investments and advice from Deutsche Bank as well as
other institutions.
</P>
<P>
   None of this is inherently unique. But Breuer has far more money
than most rivals to throw at the project. Bank officials say the
bank's total investment in electronic banking, including the costs
of marketing through its various subsidiaries, could reach $1.4
billion next year.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Most of that money will come from selling assets in Deutsche
Bank's huge portfolio of industrial stocks. Until recently, the
portfolio was almost impossible to touch because the taxes on
capital gains would have run into billions of dollars. But the
German government is now planning to let companies sell their
holdings tax-free, and Breuer plans to be a major seller.
</P>
<P>
   Derek Chambers, a banking analyst at HSBC Securities in London,
argues that the prospect of electronic banking has abruptly
deflated expectations about the merits of full-blown bank mergers
in Germany.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the last three to six months, people are questioning
whether it makes sense to put together brick-and-mortar networks,''
Chambers said. ``What is changing the business most of all right
now is how you reach customers.''
</P>
<P>
   Some industry executives go further, arguing that Deutsche Bank
should simply sell its retail branches and let an independent
company act as a neutral distribution system for rival banks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Given the structure of banking in Germany, there isn't going
to be room for four big private retail banking networks forever,''
said Andreas R. Dombrett, a former Deutsche Bank executive who is
now a managing director in J.P. Morgan's Frankfurt office. ``What
you need to do is break up the value chain between production,
distribution and transaction processing or information
technology.''
</P>
<P>
   In practice, the choices are more difficult. With seven million
customers, Deutsche Bank's retail network is a valuable channel for
selling everything from mutual funds to retirement plans.
</P>
<P>
   At the moment, only about 650,000 of Deutsche Bank's customers
use its online services. According to bank executives, about 20
percent of customers say they do not want electronic banking at
all, while 60 percent want both online services and traditional
branches.
</P>
<P>
   ``We lose clients if we close branches,'' Breuer said, noting
that the customers have already balked about staff reductions. ``We
really stretched the patience of our customers to the acceptable
limit. And although we think we did everything possible,
profitability is not comparable to our British or Spanish
competitors.''
</P>
<P>
   The result is a dilemma: keep the retail network and continue to
drag down the entire bank's profitability, or give it up and risk
losing access to millions of customers.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, Deutsche Bank's corporate and investment banking
businesses have been much stronger than has its retail business.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Deutsche Bank greatly expanded its American presence
by acquiring Bankers Trust for $10 billion. Though Deutsche Bank
had to spend hundreds of millions of dollars on bonuses to retain
executives at Bankers Trust, most analysts agree that the merger
went surprisingly well.
</P>
<P>
   Bankers Trust gave Deutsche Bank a solid position in arranging
midsize mergers and securities trading. Bankers Trust also owned
Alex. Brown, a small but well-respected investment bank
specializing in technology and health care companies.
</P>
<P>
   Propelled by torrid growth in the world's capital markets,
Deutsche Bank's net income climbed 50 percent in 1999 to 2.6
billion euros (just under $2.6 billion). Its trading revenues
soared 170 percent, to about 4.8 billion euros, and commission
income from financial services climbed 50 percent, to 8.1 billion
euros.
</P>
<P>
   The one real weak spot is retail banking _ the business of
serving ordinary private customers. Although this area generated
about $2.3 billion in revenues in Germany last year, analysts
estimate that it earned only $16 million in operating profit, and
some experts believe it barely broke even.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Deutsche Bank shares have nearly doubled from
their 52-week low of 44.06 euros last March 2, to 88.34 euros
Monday. Part of that reflects actual growth, but much of it
reflects excitement that German tax reform will let Deutsche Bank
cash in on billions of dollars from its industrial holdings. The
bank's portfolio is currently worth about $18 billion.
</P>
<P>
   But costs continue to climb as fast as revenues. Despite three
separate cost-cutting plans the last two years, Breuer has made
almost no progress toward his stated goal of reducing costs from
about 75 percent to 65 percent of revenues by 2001.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, the cost performance has been extremely poor,''
said Mark Hoge, a banking analyst at Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette
in London who recently lowered his rating on Deutsche Bank stock to
underperform.
</P>
<P>
   Breuer's preferred answer to the problem thus far has been to
invite other banks in as partners in Deutsche Bank 24.
</P>
<P>
   But that idea has run aground. Dresdner Bank, Germany's
third--largest bank, began talks last year but abruptly called them
off.
</P>
<P>
   Industry executives say the plan ran afoul of Dresdner's biggest
shareholder, the German insurance company Allianz. Allianz is
widely believed to be pushing for a merger between Dresdner and
Hypovereinsbank of Munich, Germany's second-largest bank and one in
which Allianz is also a major shareholder.
</P>
<P>
   That leaves Germany's No. 4, Commerzbank. But its chief
executive, Martin Kohlhaussen, has refused to enter any such talks.
</P>
<P>
   Such obstacles have been part of the German landscape, and
Breuer has learned to be patient about things he cannot change
himself. Asked what the solution to his concrete albatross might
be, he gave a mischievous grin and said only one word:
</P>
<P>
   ``Talk.'' &QL;

COLUMN: MCCAIN EASES THE STIGMA OF VIETNAM
</HEADLINE>

 By CLYDE HABERMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Let's not go overboard on this one. It isn't as if
the entire generation of Vietnam War veterans parades around now in
faded Army fatigues, buttonholing everyone in sight and nattering
on about those scary marches through the rice paddies and elephant
grass.
</P>
<P>
   But after long years of hunkering down in the darker recesses of
America's military past, Vietnam veterans are finally coming into
their own for their sacrifices in an unpopular war. The change has
been under way for a while. But some veterans feel it kicking into
higher gear with the rise of Sen. John McCain, whose presidential
candidacy has enabled them to bask in the reflected glory of an
honest-to-goodness war hero of their generation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The McCain phenomenon has rippled through the veterans
community,'' said Vincent McGowan, founding president of the
Manhattan chapter of Vietnam Veterans of America. The senator's run
for the White House, whether or not you like his politics, has
``shined the light of public attention on the commitment that
Vietnam veterans made back then,'' McGowan said.
</P>
<P>
   John Rowan, president of the Vietnam Veterans' New York State
Council, feels much the same way. ``It is interesting to see vets
being chased by the politicians for a change,'' Rowan said.
``Definitely, it's going around a little bit _ that to have served
is a plus.''
</P>
<P>
   To repeat, there is no need to go overboard. Main Street U.S.A.
isn't exactly tossing a parade for everyone who slogged through the
Mekong Delta. Don't hold your breath waiting for a Vietnam-era
version of ``Saving Private Ryan.'' Still, popular attitudes are
far from what they were in the 1960s and '70s, when returning
veterans found themselves ignored at best and spit on at worst,
denounced as baby killers by some war protesters.
</P>
<P>
   Many felt the scorn as recently as the mid-'80s, when New York
City dedicated the Vietnam Veterans Memorial, a wall of glass
blocks on a plaza between Water and South Streets in Lower
Manhattan. Over the years, the plaza has become a bit ragged. Many
blocks have eroded or are pockmarked _ from BB's fired at them,
McGowan said, by young vandals and disgruntled veterans.
</P>
<P>
   The deterioration is so extensive that there are plans for a $6
million redesign, which McGowan said might begin in May. But one
element will definitely not change, he said. As ever, the glass
wall will be etched with haunting reflections on war by Vietnam
grunts themselves, in poems and in letters home.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mother, I am cursed _ I'm a soldier when soldiers aren't in
fashion,'' wrote Sgt. Thomas Oathont, who was with the 173rd
Airborne Brigade in 1970 and '71. Elsewhere on the wall was this
thought from a Navy lieutenant, Richard W. Strandberg: ``One thing
worries me _ will people believe me? Will they want to hear about
it, or will they want to forget the whole thing ever happened?''
</P>
<P>
   McGowan, a former marine, looked back on the memorial's
dedication in 1985. Even then, he said, ``nobody cared what we had
been through.''
</P>
<P>
   For the longest time, images of Vietnam veterans tended to focus
on, for want of a better phrase, the Lost Boys. You know them from
news photos and TV clips: straggly-haired men with beards and
droopy mustaches who would stand forlornly in front of the Vietnam
wall in Washington, their body language screaming that their lives
would never be put back together.
</P>
<P>
   No question, the Lost Boys are still out there and in need of
help, veterans who are homeless, on drugs or trapped in the bottle.
But there are many others, too, and they are often overlooked,
McGowan said. ``Vietnam vets have become mainstream,'' he said.
``You see them everywhere, from middle management on up.''
</P>
<P>
   How do you get more mainstream than running for president?
McCain's candidacy ``certainly makes service in that war more
palatable,'' Rowan said, though he added, ``I don't know about
glamorous yet.''
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to presidential candidates, we have moved directly
from the World War II generation to the Vietnam class _ from Bob
Dole four years ago to McCain and Vice President Al Gore. The
1950-53 Korean War has been pushed to the sidelines _ once again,
dismayed veterans of what some call ``the forgotten war'' will tell
you. With the clock running, that conflict seems unlikely to
produce a future president.
</P>
<P>
   But to McGowan, it is not a question of one war being better or
worse. ``Young people in the country are seeing now that service is
important,'' he said. ``I think for a while, we lost that.''

   NEW YORK _ Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's administration and several
prominent City Council members are supporting legislation that
would require all dogs and cats sold at pet shops in the city and
any animals adopted or reclaimed from city shelters to be
sterilized. Officials said such a law would sharply reduce the
number of animals euthanized in the city each year.
</P>
<P>
   Last year 60,000 cats, dogs and other animals entered the
city-financed animal shelter system, and 65 percent of them were
put to death, while most of the others were adopted or returned to
their owners, said Marilyn Haggerty-Blohm, executive director of
the Center for Animal Care and Control, a city contractor. A few
wild animals were released.
</P>
<P>
   Under the proposed legislation, which was endorsed Monday at a
City Council hearing by the city Department of Health and a number
animal-welfare advocates, pet stores and the shelters would be
required to spay or neuter dogs or cats before selling them,
releasing them for adoption or returning them to their owners.
</P>
<P>
   Exceptions would be allowed if dogs or cats are intentionally
used for breeding or if the sterilization would endanger an
animal's life.
</P>
<P>
   Sterilization programs have worked in other cities. In Denver,
for instance, where similar legislation was adopted in 1993, the
number of impounded animals decreased by 18 percent, or about 2,000
animals, over a four-year period. The number of animals that had to
be euthanized decreased by 28 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 39,000 animals euthanized in New York City last year,
about 72 percent were killed because of old age, injuries,
temperament problems or other conditions. Haggerty-Blohm said that
with a sterilization program in place, the city could eventually
avoid the destruction of as many as 11,000 animals a year.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation would also require the city to expand its animal
shelter system, to increase its capacity to provide sterilization
and animal adoption services, and to offer round-the-clock animal
drop-offs in all boroughs.
</P>
<P>
   Only Manhattan now has an animal shelter that is open 24 hours,
although a Brooklyn shelter will expand to similar hours by April,
city officials said. Staten Island has a shelter that is open 12
hours a day, but unlike the ones in Brooklyn and Manhattan, it is
too small to offer sterilization.
</P>
<P>
   The Center for Animal Care and Control is planning to open a new
shelter in South Ozone Park, Queens, within two years, using $2.7
million in city money that has already been appropriated,
Haggerty-Blohm said. The search for a Bronx site has not yet begun.
</P>
<P>
   City officials did not say Monday how much the expanded animal
shelter system would cost and how quickly it could be set up. The
current operation costs about $8.5 million, and the American
Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals estimated that the
price of the expanded system could reach $20 million a year.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Bronx district attorney, facing criticism for
failing to get a conviction of the four officers charged with
murdering Amadou Diallo, repeatedly insisted Monday that his
prosecutors had presented a strong case for conviction and
suggested that he did not understand the jury's verdict.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I can say is these 12 people gave their best effort,''
the district attorney, Robert T. Johnson, said, ``but that doesn't
satisfy the people, the real people, the people of the entire
state, in knowing that justice worked the way it's supposed to
work.''
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference he called to address criticisms of his
handling of the case, Johnson also said the justice system broke
down when an appeals court ordered the case moved to Albany, and he
faulted the judge's instructions to the jury on how to consider the
charges.
</P>
<P>
   But seven of the jurors, in a group interview Monday on NBC's
``Today'' show, said they had no choice but to acquit based on the
law and the facts presented to them.
</P>
<P>
   One juror, Lavette Freeman, said the prosecution had given her
no basis on which to convict. ``For me that hurts,'' Freeman, who
is black, said. She added that while she understood the anger of
those protesting the verdict, ``I have to take it back to the
district attorney's office; they didn't give me anything _
nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, addressing the criticism directed against him, said:
``You know, there have been some who said that Robert Johnson
should resign. I think somebody who policed in the way these four
officers policed that night, they should resign.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``Their mistakes, their misjudgments, their
preconceptions, led to the violent and horrible death of an
innocent person.''
</P>
<P>
   Again and again, Johnson insisted that the prosecution had
offered evidence warranting a conviction, showing that the
vestibule of the Bronx apartment building where Diallo was shot was
well lighted, that there was a pause in the police gunfire, and
that Diallo had been on the ground when most of the shots were
fired.
</P>
<P>
   ``We painted the picture, and I think we painted it loud and
clear, that Amadou Diallo was prejudged,'' Johnson said. ``That
they made judgments about Amadou Diallo that were incorrect. They
made assumptions.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, speaking of the jurors, he added, ``And I don't think
anybody can say that they couldn't come to those conclusions if
they wanted to.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson suggested several times that the officers may not have
been entirely truthful in their testimony. For example, he said the
officers' assertion that they had not moved Diallo's body after the
shooting strained credulity because, ``You know, there was a search
for a gun.''
</P>
<P>
   The officers, he said, ``were testifying in front of each other
so that if they wanted to weave a case together, they could.''
</P>
<P>
   The problem his office faced, he said, was that ``basically
there are only five people who actually saw this'' _ the four
officers and Schrrie Elliott, a Bronx woman who testified for the
defense and whom Johnson implied his office did not find credible.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   He also said prosecutors did not cross-examine Dr. James J.
Fyfe, an expert on police procedures who was the defense's last
witness, because he felt Fyfe did only ``minor damage'' to the
prosecution's case. At least one juror, Helen Harder, has said she
was surprised that prosecutors did not cross-examine Fyfe.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can understand people differing with us on strategy,''
Johnson said, ``but please, no one underestimate the amount of
commitment we had to do justice in this particular matter.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Johnson said prosecutors did not raise the issue of race because
there was no ``overt proof'' that it motivated the officers'
actions, although, he said, ``there is very good reason to believe
that some doctor on Park Avenue would not have been shot reaching
for his wallet.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   He also answered criticism that prosecutors should have asked
the judge to instruct jurors to consider each of the shots
individually, on the grounds that perhaps the initial shots were
justified, but 41 were not. But Johnson said prosecutors did not
pursue that issue because ``every shot was unjustified.''
</P>
<P>
   Of Justice Joseph C. Teresi, Johnson said that prosecutors had
objected to the judge allowing the officers to claim three separate
kinds of legal justification for the shooting, two of which
presumed that Diallo was committing a crime, and Johnson reiterated
that there was no evidence of that. He also said he objected to the
judge re-reading to the jury each of the three kinds of
justification six times.
</P>
<P>
   But he also said the way the judge charged the jury reflected
the way the criminal justice system protects defendants, and he
reminded people angry about the verdict that the system similarly
protects average defendants in the Bronx.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Johnson said reports that the judge visited defense lawyers at
their bed-and-breakfast after the trial, if true, were ``extremely
disturbing, because that kind of action can destroy confidence in
the people and the system.''
</P>
<P>
   The district attorney reserved his harshest criticism for an
appellate division's decision to move the trial to Albany from the
Bronx. Calling the change of venue ``horribly wrong,'' he said, ``I
think it is going to go down in history as one of the greatest
assaults on confidence in the criminal justice system.''
</P>
<P>
   Some community leaders and elected officials have been rallying
to Johnson's defense. The Rev. Roger Hambrick said the Bronx Clergy
Task Force was going to meet with Johnson to hear his assessment of
the case. ``It's easy to point fingers now,'' he said. ``But
listen, we all knew it was going to be a very difficult task for
him to win up there.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Fernando Ferrer, the Bronx borough president, agreed, saying
that while a dialogue was useful, Johnson should not resign.
</P>
<P>
   As he did after the officers' arraignment 11 months ago,
Johnson, who is black, addressed the larger discussion about police
conduct and procedures that the Diallo case has raised.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been in the Bronx since I was 16; I have a 19-year-old
son who lives here,'' he said. ``I know that when I get stopped,
and I have a couple of times, I have to say my license is in my
back pocket; the registration is in the glove compartment. That
kind of fear that some people have has to be addressed. And even if
it's not a policy thing, it's an attitudinal thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your mind,'' he said, ``must be open to innocent
interpretations of people's conduct.''

JOHN BLASSINGAME, 59, BLACK-STUDIES HISTORIAN 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Conn., Ga.)  (lb) 
 By NICK RAVO   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   John Blassingame, a scholar of the history of slavery in America
and a former chairman of the African-American Studies program at
Yale University, died on Feb. 13 at his home in New Haven, Conn. He
was 59.
</P>
<P>
   The cause of death was not known, said his son, John W.
Blassingame Jr. of New Haven.
</P>
<P>
   Blassingame joined the Yale faculty in 1970 and became a
professor in 1974. Three early books helped solidify his academic
reputation: ``New Perspectives on Black Studies'' (University of
Illinois Press, 1971); ``The Slave Community: Plantation Life in
the Antebellum South'' (Oxford University Press, 1972); and ``Black
New Orleans, 1860-1880'' (University of Chicago Press, 1973.)
</P>
<P>
   Blassingame also became editor of the papers of Frederick
Douglass in the mid-'70s and published six volumes of Douglass'
papers and manuscripts from 1979 to 1999.
</P>
<P>
   He pioneered the recovery of voluminous autobiographical
materials by former slaves, which he collected in ``Slave
Testimony: Two Centuries of Letters, Speeches, Interviews and
Autobiographies,'' published by Louisiana State University Press in
1977.
</P>
<P>
   He was an early member of Yale's African-American Studies
Program, for which he served as acting chairman from 1971 to 1972
and from 1976 to 1977 and then as chairman from 1981 to 1989. He
was also affiliated with the university's history department and
its American studies program.
</P>
<P>
   Blassingame was born in Covington, Ga., on March 23, 1940. He
received a bachelor's degree at Fort Valley State College, a
master's degree at Howard University, and a doctorate at Yale.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his son Blassingame is survived by his wife,
Teasie; a daughter, Tia, of New Haven; his father, Grady
Blassingame of Atlanta, and a sister, Alberta Hardges of Social
Circle, Ga.

AUTHORITY AGREES TO DELAY SALE OF TWO NUCLEAR POWER PLANTS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: La., Va.)  (See also NY-NUKE-INQUIRY) 
(mk) 
 By WINNIE HU   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ The New York Power Authority agreed Monday to
delay the planned sale of two nuclear power plants to a New Orleans
company after lawmakers asked the authority to explore a higher,
last-minute bid from another company.
</P>
<P>
   The Power Authority's board was scheduled to vote Tuesday
morning on the sale of the plants _ located in Buchanan, in
Westchester County, and on Lake Ontario _ after three months of
exclusive negotiations with Entergy Corp. But Dominion Resources,
based in Virginia, made an unsolicited offer last week for $686
million. The Power Authority has said that Entergy's bid is worth
$638 million.
</P>
<P>
   Eugene Zeltmann, president and chief operating officer for the
Power Authority, told legislators at a hearing that he had not
contacted Dominion and could not negotiate with any company other
than Entergy until Tuesday evening under an exclusivity agreement.
But he said his staff was reviewing Dominion's offer.
</P>
<P>
   Michael A. Petralia, a spokesman for the Power Authority, said
later that the board had decided Monday evening to discuss the
agreement with Entergy at a meeting on Tuesday but would not take
any final vote on the sale of the power plants.
</P>
<P>
   Assemblyman Richard L. Brodsky, a Democrat from Westchester
County who is chairman of the Environmental Conservation Committee,
criticized the Power Authority for rushing to sell some of the
state's valuable assets. ``How can you responsibly close on a deal
when you can't talk to one of the bidders?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   But Zeltmann and other Power Authority officials have said that
they had negotiated a detailed agreement with Entergy that not only
brought a fair price for the nuclear power plants but also
safeguarded the jobs of the plants' 1,700 employees, among other
things. While Zeltmann defended the selection of Entergy through a
careful screening process, he emphasized that Dominion's offer
still would be considered. ``I never wanted to foreclose the
opportunity for someone to come in at the last moment,'' he said.

 &HT;    McCain rails against Robertson, Falwell
 &HT;    By Mark Sherman and Ken Herman
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   VIRGINIA BEACH, Va. _ Arizona Sen. John McCain on Monday tore
into evangelists Pat Robertson and Jerry Falwell, accusing them of
distorting his positions and smearing his supporters.
</P>
<P>
   On the eve of today's presidential primaries in Virginia and
Washington state, and caucuses in North Dakota, McCain branded
Robertson and Falwell as ``agents of intolerance'' who could lead
Republicans to defeat in November.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are the party of Ronald Reagan, not Pat Robertson,'' McCain
said. ``We are the party of Abraham Lincoln, not Bob Jones.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain compared the televangelists, who are backing Texas Gov.
George W. Bush in his presidential bid, to ``union bosses.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Neither party should be defined by pandering to the outer
reaches of American politics and the agents of intolerance, whether
they be Louis Farrakhan or Al Sharpton on the left, or Pat
Robertson and Jerry Falwell on the right,'' McCain said in a speech
to about 1,500 people at Cox High School.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, Governor Bush is a Pat Robertson Republican who
will lose to Al Gore,'' he predicted.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, campaigning in Bellevue, Wash., accused McCain of trying
to turn a political battle into a fractious religious war.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is playing the religion card. That is not Reaganesque,''
Bush said. He said the McCain campaign, as it did in Michigan, is
making telephone calls that suggest he is an anti-Catholic bigot.
</P>
<P>
   The calls tell voters of Bush's Feb. 2 visit to Bob Jones
University and of anti-Catholic statements made by the school's
leaders in the past.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to Cardinal John O'Connor of New York and other
Catholic leaders, Bush said he regrets not condemning the
anti-Catholic sentiments associated with the school during his
speech at the institution.
</P>
<P>
   McCain said Bush waited too long.
</P>
<P>
   ``His words are fine,'' McCain said. ``To me they should have
been said three weeks ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush said Monday he should not be defined by his backing from
Robertson, founder of the Christian Coalition, and Falwell, founder
of the Moral Majority.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're supporters of mine, but I've got all kinds of
supporters,'' Bush said. ``What the Republican Party needs is to
have somebody who can unite our party.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Senator McCain is someone who likes to castigate, not someone
who likes to lead,'' Bush said. ``It's important to unite our party
and lead it to victory.''
</P>
<P>
   Monday's sparring came as both candidates battled for 87
delegates available today in Washington, Virginia and North Dakota.
Next Tuesday, voters in 12 states will determine the allocation of
more than half of the delegates needed to win the Republican
nomination.
</P>
<P>
   In addressing the significance of what McCain said Monday, one
of his top strategists, John Weaver, said: ``This is a defining
moment for our party and for our campaign. We're at a fork in the
road. The party can choose the well-marked path of ... exclusion
and ultimate defeat, the path George W. Bush is taking with Jerry
Falwell and Pat Robertson as his Lewis and Clark. Or we can choose
a new path of inclusion that will produce a Republican victory and
sweeping majority in November.''
</P>
<P>
   In his Virginia Beach speech, McCain mentioned Bush just once by
name but made it clear he wants Bush to be tied so closely to the
religious right that his nomination would ensure a Democratic
victory in November.
</P>
<P>
   In primaries so far, McCain has fallen well behind Bush among
Republican voters while picking up unprecedented support from
independents and Democrats in states with open primaries.
</P>
<P>
   The March 7 primaries in California and New York are limited to
registered Republicans, and McCain is hoping that the numerous
moderate Republican voters in those states will reject Bush's ties
to religious conservative leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Robertson and Falwell, both based in southern Virginia, have
charged McCain's efforts to change campaign finance laws make him a
disloyal Republican and they have questioned his commitment to
conservative policies.
</P>
<P>
   Roberta Combs, executive vice president of the Christian
Coalition, which Robertson founded, called McCain's remarks ``a
transparent effort to divide one American from another on the basis
of religion.''
</P>
<P>
   She predicted the group's conservative message would draw record
numbers of voters to the polls.
</P>
<P>
   There was no immediate response from Falwell, founder of the
Moral Majority.
</P>
<P>
   ``They distort my pro-life positions and smear the reputations
of my supporters,'' McCain said, noting Robertson called his
national campaign co-chairman, Warren Rudman, a ``vicious bigot''
in telephone calls to voters.
</P>
<P>
   He said the criticism from Falwell and Robertson ``surprises me,
since the essence of evangelism is to seek converts.''
</P>
<P>
   ``My campaign is bringing new people into the Republican Party
every day. I don't apologize for this. No, I wear it as a badge of
honor,'' McCain said.
</P>
<P>
   McCain is apparently counting on a belief that many Republicans
are tired of the influence of Robertson and other religious leaders
in determining their party's nominee.
</P>
<P>
   For McCain, there may not be much to lose. Long before Monday's
speech, the religious right was fully mobilized against McCain.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their intensity level already is a 10,'' said McCain campaign
manager Rick Davis.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, McCain was careful to confine his remarks to
specific leaders in the religious conservative movement.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not an attack on Christian right voters,'' he told
reporters.
</P>
<P>
   At McCain's side was Gary Bauer, the Christian conservative who
ended his Republican presidential campaign earlier this month and
endorsed McCain.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this were an attack on Christian conservative voters, I
wouldn't be here,'' Bauer said.
</P>
<P>
   There also were reverberations from McCain's decision not to
take part in a debate Thursday in California. McCain blamed Bush,
arguing Bush was initially evasive about accepting the debate
invitation.
</P>
<P>
   Given the delay, McCain said, he scheduled events in New York
that can't be changed.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said, ``I'm sorry that we're not going to have the debate
in Los Angeles. I would be glad to spend the entire time on
education.''

<P>
   DENVER _ In all the hyperbole of political campaigns, it is rare
that a candidate gets quick, tangible results, but Vice President
Al Gore seems to have done it, persuading the nation's biggest
health insurance company to show more generosity to one of its
subscribers.
</P>
<P>
   Within 24 hours of Gore's appeal to the company, Aetna Inc., to
continue coverage for a 6-month-old baby born with severe brain
damage, the company agreed to do so, reversing an earlier decision.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Arthur N. Leibowitz, chief medical officer of Aetna US
Healthcare, a unit of Aetna Inc., said the company would continue
to cover private-duty skilled nursing care as long as the child
needed it.
</P>
<P>
   The child, Ian Malone of Everett, Wash., cannot eat or swallow
normally. He receives nutrition through a feeding tube and requires
continual assistance to help him breathe.
</P>
<P>
   On a campaign trip to Seattle on Sunday, Gore met with members
of the Malone family and then highlighted their plight in a speech.
</P>
<P>
   The boy's father, Dylan Malone, a graphic artist, rejoiced on
Monday. ``The vice president literally saved Ian's life,'' he said
in an interview. ``I couldn't have exposed Aetna's behavior without
Al Gore's help.''
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to Malone on Feb. 15, the regional director of Aetna
US Healthcare said, ``Ian does not qualify for the private duty
nursing care benefit'' offered under the family's health plan.
Aetna suggested that Malone and his wife, Christine, hire nurses or
provide sophisticated medical care to the baby themselves.
</P>
<P>
   In an earlier letter denying coverage, Aetna told Malone, ``This
is the final level of administrative appeal available to you under
your health plan, and this means that your administrative remedies
have been exhausted.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview on Monday, Leibowitz said: ``The vice
president's involvement and the publicity surrounding this case
over the weekend led us to make a decision in an expedited fashion.
We don't normally work on Sunday nights. These are truly agonizing
cases.''
</P>
<P>
   Malone said Aetna had suggested that he put his son up for
adoption so that the state or someone else could take financial
responsibility for Ian's medical care.
</P>
<P>
   But, Leibowitz, a pediatrician, said, ``It's a surprise to hear
that statement.'' He said he did not know what Ian's case manager
might have told the family, but he insisted that ``it is
absolutely, positively not'' the policy of the company to recommend
the adoption of children requiring expensive treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Malone said that an accident had occurred at the time of
Ian's birth, as he was delivered by a licensed midwife at a clinic.
</P>
<P>
   ``The midwife made several mistakes,'' and the baby was taken
immediately to a hospital for emergency care, she said.
</P>
<P>
   The Malone case comes amid a furious national debate over
managed health care and patients' rights. Both houses of Congress
passed bills last year defining a wide range of patients' rights,
including the right to appeal decisions denying coverage. The House
version, but not the Senate's, would also allow injured patients to
sue insurers and health maintenance organizations. Negotiators from
the two chambers will meet soon in an effort to iron out the
differences.
</P>
<P>
   The Malone case illustrates a question at the heart of the
national debate over patients' rights: What is the definition of
``medical necessity,'' and who defines what is medically necessary?
</P>
<P>
   At a rally on Monday in Denver, Gore said: ``It's time to say to
insurance companies and HMOs that decisions on health care must not
be made by the accountants and bureaucrats, who don't have a
license to practice medicine or to play God. The decisions should
be given back to doctors and nurses.''
</P>
<P>
   Chris Lehane, a spokesman for Gore, said that the vice president
called Leibowitz on Monday and thanked him for the company's latest
decision. Gore told Aetna that the marketplace often rewarded
companies for being compassionate and responsive to consumers,
Lehane said.

<P>
   As a caring American and concerned parent, I was relieved to
know that Major League Baseball was right on top of the scourge
that is Darryl Strawberry's sickness or stupidity, depending on
one's chosen level of compassion, or understanding.
</P>
<P>
   For me, the most sensible take on this debate from any
enlightened source has always been John Lucas'. On the likes of
Strawberry, pro basketball's addict-cum-counselor/coach long
maintained that the man doesn't have a drug problem as much as he
has a ``living problem.''
</P>
<P>
   We all do, to some extent. Most sportswriters I know stress out
on deadline by ingesting serious quantities of cholesterol,
caffeine or nicotine, and afterward, wish they hadn't. In those
moments when Strawberry has sought escape from whatever haunts his
sense of self-esteem, preservation and respect, he apparently
resorted to the demon powder, and afterward, has been painfully
sorry he did.
</P>
<P>
   You can smartly argue that enough apologies were accepted,
though it is useful to remember that the more moral among us were
voicing objections before he ever played a game for the Yankees.
Lucas has often said that it is easy to call for one's banishment
until it is your loved one.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees, who embraced Strawberry as their prodigal child,
were convincing when they said they cared about him more than they
needed him, because, the truth was, they didn't.
</P>
<P>
   In weighing his decision to ban Strawberry for one year with no
time off for good behavior, it seems that the commissioner, Bud
Selig, heard the pious news media more than the pleas of Joe Torre
and David Cone.
</P>
<P>
   ``A painful decision for me to make,'' Selig concluded Monday.
``In the end, I could not ignore Darryl's past infractions and
concluded that each of us must be held accountable for his or her
actions.''
</P>
<P>
   Too bad. I kind of liked having Strawberry around as an example
of the damage and waste drugs can bring. The suspension could mean
the last of Strawberry, while only proving that Selig can knock a
60-mile-an-hour fastball out of the park, or a pimple off
baseball's face.
</P>
<P>
   And while it took him less than a week to cut on Strawberry,
Selig is deep into his second year on a more vexing problem,
enhancement compounds, the snappy curve ball he has been looking at
for nothing but strikes.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, a study commissioned by baseball resulted in
the report that revealed that moderate amounts of androstenedione
taken over seven days increased testosterone levels in men. If you
missed this important story, it was, in part, because baseball
released it with a successful and self-serving spin.
</P>
<P>
   In a joint statement, the commissioner's office and the players
association agreed (now there is a statement in itself) that the
study offered no evidence to support the contention that ``the
levels of testosterone were sufficient to produce enhanced
performance.''
</P>
<P>
   What wasn't said was that the scientists were never commissioned
or financed to extend the study that far. In the interests of
protecting Mark McGwire's home run record, baseball proudly
announced that it had proved its case by doing nothing.
</P>
<P>
   That not half the stink was raised over scientific proof that
andro changes blood levels and poses long-term health risks as
there has been over one man's relapse told Don Gatlin that ``either
the public hasn't figured out what's going on or it doesn't care
that so many athletes are on performance-enhancement drugs.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, athletes (Tom Gugliotta of the Phoenix Suns, to name
one) and, more frighteningly, young wannabes everywhere continue
taking over-the-counter substances about which they have not a
clue.
</P>
<P>
   Gatlin, director of the Olympic Analytical Laboratory at UCLA,
was one of the secondary collaborators in the baseball study, led
by Dr. Benjamin Leder and Dr. Joel Finkelstein of the Massachusetts
General Hospital. While more cautious than Gatlin in advising
people against the use of andro, Finkelstein agreed Monday that
this is a ``serious public health issue, beyond being a sports
issue.''
</P>
<P>
   McGwire said last season that he had ceased using andro, but
didn't denounce the product and baseball didn't ban it and now is
merely supporting more federally financed research that Gatlin said
will take ``three or four years.''
</P>
<P>
   Darryl Strawberry, who could've been McGwire, will be a memory
by the time baseball has to admit it was years behind other sports
on this issue. Some day, baseball may even have to put an asterisk
next to McGwire's name in the record book. In the meantime, the
improvident Strawberry has been sent away, perhaps forever, for the
good of the game, and as an example for the country's imitative
youth.

BOEING TO ANNOUNCE LAUNCH OF 777X PROJECTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JAMES WALLACE  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Though many of the engineers and technicians who work
on the project are on strike, Boeing executives Tuesday will
announce in New York the long-awaited launch of two super
long-range versions of the popular 777.
</P>
<P>
   The planes are targeted for Asian airlines looking for 21st
century widebody jets that have the range to fly more than 300
passengers non-stop between Asia and the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing landed around 30 firm orders worth more than $5 billion,
so the company's board of directors gave the go ahead Monday to
formally launch the two planes, sources said.
</P>
<P>
   Another 15 to 20 orders are pending, the sources said. If they
become firm, Boeing would have nearly $10 billion worth of orders
for the jets, which will compete against two Airbus planes that
already are in development.
</P>
<P>
   Although Boeing had been expected to launch the planes soon,
Tuesday's announcement comes in the midst of a three-week-old
strike by about 18,000 of the company's engineers and technical
workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The timing is kind of awkward,'' said Peter Jacobs, aerospace
analyst with the Ragen MacKenzie Group in Seattle. ``It's kind of
ironic that the engineers and technical workers who are key to
designing and developing these planes are out on strike and feel
alienated by the company.''
</P>
<P>
   Charles Bofferding, executive director of the Society of
Professional Engineering Employees in Aerospace, which represents
about 14,000 of the engineers and technicians, questioned how
Boeing can expect go forward with the project when its engineers
aren't working.
</P>
<P>
   ``This announcement underscores how critical Boeing technical
workers are to their long-term success,'' he said. ``They (Boeing)
need to send some people to the negotiating table that are wilLing
to negotiate.''
</P>
<P>
   Mediation to settle the increasingly bitter strike broke down
over the weekend, and no new talks are scheduled. The strike is
sure to be raised as an issue Tuesday when Boeing Chairman Phil
Condit and Commercial Airplanes boss Alan Mulally join Jack Welch,
chairman of General Electric, in making the launch announcement at
Welch's office in New York's Rockefeller Plaza.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing last year selected General Electric as exclusive supplier
of the powerful engines that will be needed for the new planes.
Also, the aircraft leasing unit of General Electric is believed to
be one of the launch customers for the new jets. Other possible
launch customers that Boeing has been talking with include EVA
Airways of Taiwan, Air France, All Nippon Airways, Cathay Pacific,
Singapore Airlines, Japan Airlines and International Lease Finance
Corp.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have been getting very enthusiastic response from customers
for going ahead with the project,'' Mulally said in an interview
earlier this month with the Seattle Post-Intelligencer.
</P>
<P>
   But the new Boeing planes face significant challenges.
</P>
<P>
   Airbus is well into the development of two ultra-long-range
planes. The A340-500 will go head to head with the 777-200X, and
the A340-600 will compete with the 777-300X. Both Airbus planes
should be in service by September 2002, while Boeing will not
deliver the first of its new jets until the spring of 2003.
</P>
<P>
   David Venz, Airbus spokesman in the United States, said Monday
the European airplane maker has more than 100 firm orders and
commitments for the A340-500/600.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are surprised they are coming in so late,'' he said of
Boeing's decision to finally launch the 777X jets.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing had hoped to launch its two planes in 1997, but customer
response was lukewarm, in part because the planes lacked the range
and performance that many Asian airlines wanted. Many improvements
have since been made to the design, and Boeing now has the orders
to proceed with a launch.
</P>
<P>
   The 301-seat 777-200X will be able to fly up to 10,100 miles,
and the 359-seat 777-300X up to 8,314 miles. The 777-300X is seen
as a replacement for older models of the 747.
</P>
<P>
   Some of those customers Boeing has been courting, such as
Malaysia Airlines, are unhappy that General Electric will be the
sole supplier of the new engines for the planes.
</P>
<P>
   General Electric builds the GE-90 engine for existing 777-200s
and 777-300s.
</P>
<P>
   But most airlines that fly the 777 use engines built by
Rolls-Royce or Pratt &AMP; Whitney. Malaysia Airlines, which had
committed early on in 1997 to the 777X, is now reportedly leaning
toward the Airbus planes because they will be powered by
Rolls-Royce, as are other 777s in Malaysia's fleet.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing chose General Electric in part because it did not believe
the market for the 777X planes _ about 500 total _ is big enough to
justify having three engine makers. Also, General Electric is
offering substantial financial support toward Boeing's developments
costs. Boeing will not disclose those total costs, but industry
analysts say they likely will be close to $2 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, analysts welcomed the launch decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``Boeing has needed to get this into the market for a while
now,'' said Joe Campbell of Lehman Brothers in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a plane they envisioned from day one when they were
designing the 777.''
</P>
<P>
   He and other analysts also said the launch means Boeing
Commercial Airplanes will see some increased spending on research
and development.
</P>
<P>
   Typically, Boeing spends from 3 percent to 5 percent of revenue
on research and development, depending on where it is in the
manufacturing cycle.
</P>
<P>
   During the last three months of 1999, research and development
for Commercial Airplanes was only $89 million, or less than 1
percent of the group's revenue of $10 billion. It was $222 million
in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said the numbers explain why many Boeing engineers have
griped that the company appears more bent on making a profit and
pleasing shareholders than on taking financial risks on new
aircraft development programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``This launch (of the 777X) will mean engineers will have an
exciting project to work on once they come back,'' Campbell said.
</P>
<P>
   Julie Smart, a 777X structures engineer who is on strike, said
she is pleased Boeing finally decided to launch the project. She
was part of the development team back in 1997 when the project was
slowed.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the right time to bring these planes to market,'' she
said Monday. ``Now is the time to do it. We have the right
airplanes.''
</P>
<P>
   But she added:
</P>
<P>
   ``I find it curious they would launch with the engineers out.
... This is the correct step (the 777X launch) to take to preserve
the company, but it's frustrating they did not want to settle with
us before going ahead.''

WASHINGTON PRIMARY ARRIVES WITH AL GORE ON CRUISE CONTROL 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By BENNETT ROTH 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ Enjoying a big lead in key states that hold March
primaries, Al Gore is opting more for motion than matter these days
as he works to motivate loyalists without stirring up controversy.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president's travel itinerary is as busy as ever _ he
had four events in two Western states before flying to Los Angeles
late Monday evening.
</P>
<P>
   But the Democratic presidential front-runner's speeches rarely
contain any new themes, and he has not unveiled any substantial
policy recommendations recently.
</P>
<P>
   Those who follow him can recite by memory his standard lines,
such as, ``We've just begun to fight,'' and ``The presidency is not
an academic exercise, not a seminar on some grand theory.''
</P>
<P>
   To guard against unpredictable headlines, Gore also has not held
a news conference in months, foreclosing opportunities by the media
to press him on timely issues.
</P>
<P>
   Often the only thing that changes from one campaign stop to
another is Gore's wardrobe, which alternates between dark suits and
earth-toned slacks and sports shirts.
</P>
<P>
   While his rival, former Sen. Bill Bradley, continues to slam
Gore, increasingly the vice president is not returning the fire.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to say an unkind word about my opponent,'' he
told supporters at an airport rally in Pueblo, Colo. Rather, he
said, voters should vote for him because ``I'll do a better job and
I'm the one who came to Pueblo.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley, who has invested nearly a week in Washington state in
preparation for Tuesday's nonbinding primary there, said in
Seattle, ``I knew it would be difficult, and it has been.''
</P>
<P>
   He promised to plow ahead to the March 7 ``Super Tuesday''
primaries, no matter what.
</P>
<P>
   Gore is not even bothering to spend the last two days before the
Washington primary in that state, although he conducted interviews
with Seattle and Spokane television stations Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president swung through the Seattle area last weekend,
but he quickly moved on to Colorado, which holds its primary March
10, and then later to Arizona, which holds its Democratic contest
March 11.
</P>
<P>
   At campaign stops in Colorado, Gore sounded very much like a
general election candidate, aiming his criticism squarely at the
Republican presidential candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Gore faulted John McCain for opposing abortion rights,
environmental controls and gun control. Although on the day that
the vice president visited McCain's home state of Arizona he also
acknowledged he agreed with the senator's support of campaign
finance reform and anti-tobacco measures.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president raised the issue of gun control at a downtown
Denver rally when he spoke about last year's shootings at nearby
Columbine High School.
</P>
<P>
   Claiming he did not want to politicize the tragedy, he
nevertheless blasted the GOP candidates for being ``in the hip
pocket of the NRA.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore contrasted the booming economy under the Clinton
administration with the doldrums of the Reagan-Bush years.
</P>
<P>
   ``When they were in power before, they ran our economy into the
ground,'' he said in Pueblo. ``We don't want to go back to those
days.''
</P>
<P>
   The vice president also gloated over a decision by Aetna
insurance company to continue health coverage for the son of a
Washington state couple who met with the vice president in Seattle
on Sunday. Gore had publicized their plight at a rally there and
publicly chided Aetna for denying coverage to the 5-month-old son.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president told a Seattle station that he was glad that
the publicity he gave the case forced the health insurer to back
down.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley started the day before dawn in Seattle, searching for
votes among commuters at the ferry terminal. He left the state on a
high note after a rainy but spirited rally at the University of
Washington that drew about 1,000 supporters.
</P>
<P>
   He said that whatever happens Tuesday is ``not determinate of
March 7.''
</P>
<P>
   From Washington, Bradley headed to California for a
day-and-a-half courtesy call. Gore leads by a whopping 5-to-1
margin in the latest polls gauging California's March 7 jackpot
primary.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley then planned to turn his focus for the final days before
``Super Tuesday'' to New York and New England, where he has shown
stronger appeal.

<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ To Californians, it was all a little baffling. Why
would Sen. John McCain pull out of the only Republican debate
scheduled in the nation's most populous state the week before the
highest-stakes primary on the political calendar?
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't fathom it for a moment,'' said Zev Yaroslavsky, a
Democrat on the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors. ``It's
been promoted quite a bit already, and to me, even though it's in
California, it's a national debate. McCain must feel he has a
darned good reason for pulling out of what is the last debate
before Super Tuesday. But I don't get it.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain's decision to withdraw from the forum this Thursday in
Los Angeles took everyone by surprise, including the debate's
sponsors, CNN and The Los Angeles Times, which appeared to be
holding out hope Monday that McCain would reconsider. It also
caused dissension in McCain's own campaign: His communications
director, Daniel Schnur, was quoted in several California
newspapers Monday as saying that the withdrawal was ``definitely a
mistake'' and ``a tactical error at the staff level.''
</P>
<P>
   Aides to McCain announced on Sunday that he was pulling out of
the event to campaign in New York, which also holds a primary on
March 7. They complained that while they agreed to the encounter
weeks ago, their opponent, Gov. George W. Bush, only consented last
Wednesday, the day after his losses in Michigan and Arizona, and by
then, McCain had made other plans.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Murphy, McCain's senior strategist, said the campaign had
decided to stick to its new schedule _ which includes a ride Friday
on McCain's ``Straight Talk Express'' campaign bus by the ``Today''
show _ because it offers far more free media exposure. ``I'm going
for the bigger ratings, the bigger audience,'' Murphy said. Howard
Opinsky, a McCain spokesman, added that the campaign suggested
instead that the two debate on NBC's ``Meet the Press'' this
Sunday, in Buffalo, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   But aides to Bush were happy to reinforce the impression being
left in California that with polls showing the governor with a huge
lead among Republican voters, McCain decided to head east, where
his chances looked better on March 7. New York, Massachusetts and
Rhode Island are among the states in which the senator has said he
expects a strong showing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know how you can interpret it,'' said Gerry Parsky,
the Bush campaign chairman in California, ``other than that the
McCain campaign is writing off California or treating it much less
importantly.'' Ari Fleischer, a Bush campaign spokesman, said, ``I
don't think he had a scheduling conflict; he had a polling
conflict.''
</P>
<P>
   Some Republican tacticians were troubled by McCain's pullout.
The Los Angeles debates _ the Democrats are to go head to head in a
similar forum on Wednesday _ were expected to be galvanizing
encounters in a diffuse week of campaigning. The tacticians
wondered if McCain's action would hurt his standing among those
drawn to his candidacy because he seems different from other
politicians.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's much more dangerous for McCain because McCain voters want
to see him,'' said Frank Luntz, a Republican pollster. ``There's an
intensity to the McCain voter who is highly interested in the
campaign and anxiously wants to hear everything he has to say. They
are more likely to be turned off than a typical Bush supporter.''
</P>
<P>
   If timing is everything, the withdrawal could not have come at a
less desirable juncture for McCain in the battle for the 162
delegates in California's winner-takes-all Republican balloting; it
has forced him into the defensive argument that he is not conceding
California, when, in fact, the campaign has devoted a lot of time
and money to the state.
</P>
<P>
   John Weaver, McCain's political director, said the campaign was
spending $3 million on advertising in California, the largest
commitment it was making anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   Despite McCain's action, the news organizations said the forum
would go on with Bush and Alan Keyes participating. It was not
clear, however, if the sponsors would allow McCain to participate
from a remote location, as he did for an earlier debate in Phoenix,
or if they would opt for a theatrical flourish and set up a chair
or podium for him, on the off chance of a last-minute entrance.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush campaign seemed to support the idea. Fleischer said
that before Bush had agreed to participate, the organizers were
threatening to do the same to him: ``When we were advising The Los
Angeles Times that we could not give them a decision, they said it
would be McCain, Keyes and an empty chair.''

<P>
   One spring long ago, my husband and I flew to London on a
Swinging Weekend charter flight, sharing a sleepless night with
friends, casino-bound New Jerseyans and a Broadway star, her
husband and her lawyer. The star was going to London to buy an
African carving; the three were pooling their duty-free allowance
so it would enter the United States without tax. Returning, they
carried their trophy aboard in delight.
</P>
<P>
   Spring must stimulate human acquisitive instincts: It is a busy
season for buying, whether at flea markets, shops, auctions or
shows.
</P>
<P>
   A major show of American works, the Philadelphia Antiques Show
at the 33rd Street Armory, will be held from April 8 to 12. In
London, the Chelsea Antiques Fair runs from March 17 to 26 at the
Old Town Hall on the King's Road, and the British Antique Dealers'
Association Fair, a new event at the Duke of York's Headquarters on
the King's Road, is March 22 to 28. The Grosvenor House fair will
be held June 14 to 20 on Park Lane; the Fine Art and Antiques Fair
June 8 to 18 at the Olympia on Hammersmith Road. (Information at
www.londontown.com.)
</P>
<P>
   Some people travel to buy, as the Broadway star did; most people
buy antiques, old books and art to retain memories of their trip.
But when one progresses from flea-market tables into serious
buying, things grow less casual. Here are some aspects requiring
attention from those stepping into bigger purchases abroad.
</P>
<P>
   Let the Buyer Beware
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, if you like an object and it is in acceptable
condition, you won't go too far wrong buying at a show like those
above. The British Antique Dealers and similar associations select
their peers carefully; one unscrupulous merchant hurts them all.
</P>
<P>
   This is not the case in London's Bermondsey market or other
strips of shops and stands, where part of the fun is the
eccentricity. You may get guidance from ``Antique and Flea Markets
of London and Paris'' by Rupert Thomas and Egle Salvy (Thames &AMP;
Hudson, $19.95). This 1999 paperback has charming photographs and
phrases like ``covetable junk'' that indicate what you may find in
a given area.
</P>
<P>
   If you are spending a considerable sum, you probably want some
expert help, and electronics has made it easier. The ability to
transmit electronic images has revolutionized the world of art and
antique evaluation, according to John A. Hays of Christie's in New
York, who specializes in fine American furniture.
</P>
<P>
   He said that electronic inquiries referred to his department had
risen ``from zero two years ago'' to a steady stream now. A
Sotheby's spokeswoman, Lindsey S. Pryor, said that she gets 100
e-mail inquiries a day.
</P>
<P>
   Hays says he gets inquiries from England, South America and even
South Africa about furniture that proves to be American. It's a
result, he says, of a thriving ``venture cargo'' business in
earlier centuries: Half of what furniture makers created was loaded
onto vessels for sale down the line.
</P>
<P>
   However, the word ``appraisal'' is not properly applied to a
response given by a reputable dealer to an electronic photograph
and inquiry, despite the use of the term in the names of some
services. Rather it is an informed opinion. Dealers' formal
appraisals, made for estates or gifts, are given after inspection
and are done for a fee; the organization stands behind such an
opinion.
</P>
<P>
   Pryor said that Sotheby's does not evaluate objects that people
are considering buying, but will give a range of what similar
objects have brought at auction recently. Christie's characterized
its evaluations as ``preliminary.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither organization charges for this service. The time needed
for a reply depends on the backlog.
</P>
<P>
   The Christie's site, www.christies.com, provides phone numbers
for its departments; until the auction house departmentalizes its
e-mail addresses, shoppers should phone the department first and
ask where to send an electronic inquiry. Sotheby's is also
preparing to sort its e-mail to particular experts; meanwhile, the
Web site, Sothebys.com, gives one e-mail address for both formal
and informal inquiries: appraisalsna(at)sothebys.com.
</P>
<P>
   With all inquiries, several photographs, measurements and a
description are needed.
</P>
<P>
   Faster opinions on the value of a proposed purchase is the goal
of a service just started by Leslie Hindman, a cable-channel expert
who owned a big auction house in Chicago that was bought by
Sotheby's in 1997. Hindman's service, called eppraisals, intends to
provide prompt evaluation on the basis of an electronic image,
measurements and a description _ for a fee.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Decker, a journalist with a background in antiques, has
the title of ``chief community strategist'' for eppraisals. He said
that three experts in New York could call on a network of
specialists, and since the image moves electronically,
consultations are quick. The company, which started operating Feb.
1, charges $20 for its evaluation, which it guarantees to provide
at the start of the fourth business day after the image is
received, as clocked in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Decker has advice for inexperienced buyers. ``Be sure you have a
tape measure,'' he said. ``Get a good description of the condition
of the object.'' For those without a digital camera, which is the
fastest way to go, a conventional photograph can be taken to a
short-order photo-processor and a transmittable image obtained. Or
a regular print can be scanned into a computer. More information:
www.eppraisals.com.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Pedigree Papers
</P>
<P>
   The seller should provide satisfactory documentation of what has
been bought and for how much. The object's age is quite important,
particularly for duty in the United States. The seller usually
includes a description of the condition, especially if the object
has been mended or dented, lest the buyer say something was
concealed. The probable place of origin can be noted.
</P>
<P>
   Then comes the worst part _ getting the object home. My hairiest
experience was arriving for a flight from London to Dublin,
carrying on a huge tea set neatly tied up in several boxes, and
discovering that the police at the London airport wanted to unwrap
every piece to be sure I was not running arms.
</P>
<P>
   The major shows anticipate this. At the British Antique Dealers'
Association Fair this month, among others, professional packing and
shipping companies will be present. Gander &AMP; White, with an office
in New York as well as London and Paris, is one such outfit.
</P>
<P>
   Mark O. Aiston, the U.S. director of the company, said that for
objects of some size, professional shipping was essential. ``It
comes inside our container,'' he said. ``It is never handled on the
dock.'' Gander &AMP; White ships a container to New York every two to
three weeks, he said, so it is four or five weeks before the object
is in hand.
</P>
<P>
   Prices for packing and shipping, Aiston said, are based on the
size of the object, its insurance value and some modest customs
charges, although there is no duty for objects 100 years old or
more.
</P>
<P>
   ``Never assume that something is going to be insured
automatically,'' Aiston said. ``We insure if we are asked. That is
because dealers have their own. Insurance stops the
finger-pointing.''
</P>
<P>
   Things being shipped professionally have their own customs
forms, prepared by the shipper, and they are not listed on the
travelers' declarations for customs.
</P>
<P>
   For objects being carried away, he said, a dealer will usually
offer to get it wrapped for the buyers. Aiston said his company's
representatives at the major shows do not charge for such services.
The hand-carried parcel should come with export documentation, to
prevent the undoing experience I had in London.
</P>
<P>
   When items are packed for carrying on the buyer's request, the
charge is hourly, Aiston said. Packing my tea set at today's rates,
he said, would probably have cost me $160, and probably would have
been worth it to have documents certifying what it was. Aiston's
company's site is www.ganderandwhite.com.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Customs regulations affecting art and antiques are many
and arcane. For most amateur buyers, a free booklet called ``Know
Before You Go, Customs Regulations for U.S. Residents'' can help.
The current edition, printed in May 1997, is about to be replaced.
The version on www.customs.ustreas.gov was due for revision this
month.
</P>
<P>
   The duty-free limit is still $400 a person, but another level,
at which a plain passenger changes into an importer and must fill
out more complex documents, was adjusted upward to $2,000 on Jan.
1, 1998. A single object for which over $2,000 was paid may require
the bigger form.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Mushinske, the Customs Service specialist on art and
antiques, said that duty rates on most objects had been dropping 10
percent a year, too, and the booklets no longer include such rates
for this reason.
</P>
<P>
   An object still has to be 100 years old to qualify as an antique
for Customs purposes. The service interprets ``circa'' as five
years either way, so ``circa 1900'' will not cut it, although
``circa 1895'' will.
</P>
<P>
   ``The object must have existed 100 years ago the way it is
now,'' Mushinske said. ``If a 100-year-old vase has been turned
into a lamp, it will not classify as an antique.''
</P>
<P>
   The British Tourist Authority says that antiques _ 100 years old
_ are not subject to the British value added tax.

 By DAVID BARSTOW   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   VIRGINIA BEACH, Va. _ Taking his presidential campaign to a
stronghold of Christian conservatism, Sen. John McCain of Arizona
delivered a harsh attack Monday on the ``self-appointed leaders''
of the religious right, depicting them as intolerant empire
builders who ``have turned good causes into businesses'' while
attempting to exclude all but ``card-carrying Republicans'' from
the party.
</P>
<P>
   McCain singled out for criticism two of the Christian right's
best-known leaders, Pat Robertson, the founder of the Christian
Coalition, and the Rev. Jerry Falwell, the founder of the Moral
Majority. He compared Robertson to ``union bosses who have
subordinated the interests of working families to their own
ambitions,'' and he accused both men of attempting to distort his
position on abortion and ``smear the reputations of my
supporters.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The politics of division and slander are not our values,''
McCain said during a somber address to some 4,000 people who packed
a high school gymnasium here only a few miles from the headquarters
of the Christian Coalition. ``They are corrupting influences on
religion and politics and those who practice them in the name of
religion or in the name of the Republican Party or in the name of
America shame our faith, our party and our country.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain's remarks came on the eve of another primary day in what
has become a bitter battle with Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, a
fight that has become increasingly focused on the appeals Bush made
to religious conservatives in winning the South Carolina primary.
And while McCain's statements Monday may cost him votes among the
religious right in Virginia, whose contest is one of three to be
held on Tuesday, his aides were counting on media coverage to
attract more moderate voters in New York, Ohio and California _ who
vote on March 7 and are more crucial to McCain's overall strategy.
</P>
<P>
   Campaigning in Washington state Monday, Bush dismissed McCain's
remarks. ``This is a political game that Senator McCain is trying
to play by pitting one group of people against another,'' he said
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a problem-solver,'' he added. ``It sounds like he's a
finger-pointer.''
</P>
<P>
   Robertson could not be reached for comment, but the Christian
Coalition released a statement saying, ``Christian Coalition will
rise above this transparent effort to divide one American from
another on the basis of religion. Our pro-family message of faith
and freedom will draw citizens to the polls in record numbers as we
encourage all people of faith to continue their active involvement
in the process we call Democracy.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for Falwell said he would have no comment. During
his address, and again in interviews with reporters, McCain
repeatedly framed his speech not as an attack on the Christian
right, but as an appeal to religious conservatives to join him in
condemning political tactics pursued by Robertson and Falwell on
behalf of Bush..
</P>
<P>
   As he has for weeks, McCain on Monday accused Robertson of
slandering his national campaign co-chairman, former Sen. Warren
Rudman, R-N.H., in telephone calls to voters, by calling him a
``vicious bigot'' for criticisms he had made of the religious
right. McCain also suggested that leaders of the religious right
may have been behind other calls and e-mails to voters accusing him
of fathering children out of wedlock and pointing out that he and
his wife, Cindy, have adopted a daughter from Bangladesh.
</P>
<P>
   ``Neither party,'' he added, ``should be defined by pandering to
the outer reaches of American politics and the agents of
intolerance, whether they be Louis Farrakhan or Al Sharpton on the
left, or Pat Robertson and Jerry Falwell on the right.
</P>
<P>
   ``Political intolerance by any political party is neither a
Judeo-Christian nor an American value,'' he also said.
</P>
<P>
   On his campaign bus, he told reporters, ``Before South Carolina,
I don't think I would have given a speech like this.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain's aides said the speech was partly intended to
reemphasize Bush's avid support from Christian conservatives one
day after he expressed regret, in a letter to Cardinal John
O'Connor of New York, for an address he gave at Bob Jones
University, a bastion of the religious right in South Carolina
whose leaders have spoken harshly of Catholics and banned
interracial dating.
</P>
<P>
   McCain referred to Bush in his speech as a ``Pat Robertson
Republican who will lose to Al Gore,'' and later, his press aides
distributed a packet of campaign materials and news reports that
they said showed numerous links between Bush's campaign and top
officials at Bob Jones University. One Bush flyer quoted Bob
Taylor, a dean at Bob Jones University, praising Bush for his
``pro-family leadership.''
</P>
<P>
   But a subtext of the speech was McCain's campaign finance
proposals, including limits on advertisements by advocacy groups.
Robertson and anti-abortion advocates have said those restrictions
would stifle their influence and were one reason they opposed
McCain.
</P>
<P>
   In his speech McCain said of them: ``They distort my pro-life
positions and smear the reputations of my supporters. Why? Because
I don't pander to them, because I don't ascribe to their failed
philosophy that money is our message.''
</P>
<P>
   More broadly, McCain described his speech as part of an effort
to redefine the Republican Party itself, to move it closer to the
center, much as President Clinton tried to do to the Democratic
Party during his 1992 campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are the party of Ronald Reagan, not Pat Robertson,'' McCain
said in his speech. ``We are the party of Theodore Roosevelt, not
the party of special interests. We are the party of Abraham
Lincoln, not Bob Jones. Join us. Join us.''
</P>
<P>
   As he concluded, the crowd _ half of which were high school
students _ stood and applauded enthusiastically.
</P>
<P>
   Bush scoffed at the senator's claims: ``Ronald Reagan didn't
point fingers. He never played to people's religious fears, as
Senator McCain has shamelessly done.''
</P>
<P>
   In California, Leslie Goodman, a Republican political consultant
in Sacramento who backs Bush, said of McCain: ``Truly, the prince
of candor has turned into the king of media pander. But what he is
really doing is confirming to rank-and-file Republicans that he's
at war with everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   According to McCain's aides, the idea of the speech was first
suggested by McCain's campaign manager, Rick Davis, during a flight
on Friday from San Diego to Cleveland. As McCain's senior advisers
debated whether to make a campaign stop in Maryland or Virginia,
Davis suggested going to Virginia and making a speech some place
like Lynchburg, where Falwell is based. But the campaign settled on
Robertson's back yard instead. ``It's not just a major moment in
this campaign, it's a major moment for social conservatives,'' said
Marshall Wittman, a former legislative director for the Christian
Coalition who advises McCain and joined the campaign for the
speech.

LIGHTS! CAMERA! ARPAIO! 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By E.J. MONTINI  
 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  
(PHOENIX) - No sooner did an Arizona production company announce
its plans to make a ``cute or fun'' movie about Maricopa County
Sheriff Joe Arpaio when serious casting problems set in.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Arpaio sees Robert DeNiro or Al Pacino in the title role of a
film to be based on his book, America's Toughest Sheriff, though he
says he's willing to settle for Joe Pesci.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, producers have floated the name of Roseanne's
ex-husband, Tom Arnold, perhaps because the late Jackie Gleason
isn't available to reprise the Sheriff Buford T. Justice character
he perfected in Smokey and the Bandit.
</P>
<P>
   And that's just the beginning of the casting quandary.
</P>
<P>
   Who will play Arpaio's right-hand man, double-dipping Deputy
Dave Hendershott?
</P>
<P>
   Don Knotts is still alive, but anyone who knows Hendershott can
tell you Knotts isn't a big enough actor to fill the deputy's
shoes, or any other part of his wardrobe. Still, the role cries out
for the performer who immortalized Barney Fife.
</P>
<P>
   After all, the chief executive officer of Desert Winds
production company told The Republic that the movie of Arpaio's
life will be ``cute or fun.``
</P>
<P>
   But what about David Michael Pecard? Who'll play the AWOL
soldier from Fort Huachuca who talked his way into the sheriff's
inner circle, obtained keys, a badge and an office, and even posed
as Arpaio's bodyguard?
</P>
<P>
   I hear O.J.'s available.
</P>
<P>
   Then there are the deputies who say they were forced out of
their jobs by henchmen trying to purge news leaks from the
Sheriff's Office? Perhaps they could play themselves. They need the
work.
</P>
<P>
   Who'll get the ``cute or fun'' role of Wayne Bates, the postal
worker who was hauled off to jail in front of TV cameras for using
pepper spray on a pair of fenced-in dogs? No charges were filed,
though Bates did file a whopping lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   And who will they cast as Tim Griffin, a one-time inmate at
Joe's jail who was denied medical treatment for a perforated ulcer
after begging for help? A Superior Court jury ordered the county to
pay him $1.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   Who'll play George E. Sullivan and Gene Miller, experts who
produced reports on the brutality in Joe's lockups?
</P>
<P>
   A convincing young actor is needed to portray Jeremy Flanders.
He was beaten by inmates at Joe's Tent City jail and later awarded
more than $900,000.
</P>
<P>
   And what about Richard Post? He's a paraplegic abused while in
sheriff's custody and later paid $800,000. There aren't many actors
who can do ``cute or fun'' from a wheelchair, particularly when
being roughed up.
</P>
<P>
   It'll be especially difficult to cast the part of County
Attorney Rick Romley. The local prosecutor recently joined the long
list of those who've filed suit against Arpaio. It's all part of a
two-man feud that's been nastier, longer-running and more
entertaining than the one made famous by Boss Hogg and the Dukes of
Hazzard.
</P>
<P>
   Then, there's the problem of financing. Movies are expensive
propositions. They require the support of wealthy investors.
</P>
<P>
   I'm personally acquainted with a nice couple who recently came
into $8.25 million. Jaron and Deena Norberg received the cash from
Maricopa County to settle a lawsuit they'd filed after their son
died horribly at the hands of Joe's guards.
</P>
<P>
   Trouble is, even if some of that $8.25 million was used to solve
money problems for producers of the ``cute or fun'' movie they'd
still be left with a tricky casting dilemma.
</P>
<P>
   Who'll play Scott Norberg? &QL;

VIRGINIA BEACH, Va.: the speech.
<TEXT>
<P>
   On Sunday McCain's speechwriter, Marc Salter, began drafting the
address, and revisions continued until an hour before the speech.
There was an air of anticipation about McCain as his bus pulled up
to Cox High School. McCain, who likes to encourage the view that he
is a straight talker who refuses to pander to audiences, said he
relished the prospect of taking on Robertson in what one aide
described as a ``target-rich environment.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I must admit,'' McCain said before getting off the bus, ``that
being on the Death Star is an environment we've become comfortable
with.''
</P>
<P>
   But while McCain was offering up jaunty Star Wars metaphors and
insisting he was unconcerned by the political risks of criticizing
the leaders of the religious right, he and his aides took several
steps to minimize the chances that some would interpret his words
as an attack on all Christian fundamentalists.
</P>
<P>
   They made certain to stud the speech with signposts of McCain's
conservative record _ from his eagerness to ban partial birth
abortions, to opposition of tax increases, to his admiration for
Ronald Reagan. And during his speech, McCain was careful to praise
several leaders of the religious right, including Chuck Colson,
founder of Prison Fellowship, an evangelical group that ministers
to inmates.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let me be clear,'' McCain said. ``Evangelical leaders are
changing America for the better.''
</P>
<P>
   He also brought along with him a well-known social conservative,
Gary Bauer, a former Republican presidential candidate and once the
executive director of the Family Research Council. ``If this were
an attack on Christian voters I wouldn't be here today,'' said
Bauer, who endorsed McCain shortly after he dropped out of the
race.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Still, there was no disguising the extraordinary sight of a
major Republican candidate so directly and vehemently denouncing
two highly visible leaders from the very wing of the party that for
nearly 20 years has been a dominant force in getting Republicans
elected.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether he was concerned that his speech might rupture the
Republican Party, McCain flipped the question around toward
Robertson and Falwell.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've already ripped the party apart with what they did in
South Carolina and other campaigns,'' he said as his campaign
airplane left Virginia for the West Coast. ``I'm trying to bring
the party back together.''
</P>
<P>
   Several aides pointed out that reconciliation was central to the
one passage in the speech that brought a hush over the otherwise
squirming high school students. In the passage, McCain recounted
the time he was tied up in ``torture ropes'' and left in an empty
room after his capture in the Vietnam War. A guard, he said,
loosened the ropes, then tightened them before his ``less
humanitarian comrades returned.''
</P>
<P>
   Months later, McCain said, the two of them stood together in the
prison courtyard on a Christmas morning. Without uttering a word,
McCain said, the guard drew a cross in the dirt with his sandal.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is my faith,'' McCain said. ``The faith that unites and
never divides, the faith that bridges unbridgeable gaps in
humanity.''

LIGHTS! CAMERA! ARPAIO! 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By E.J. MONTINI  
 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  
(PHOENIX) - No sooner did an Arizona production company announce
its plans to make a ``cute or fun'' movie about Maricopa County
Sheriff Joe Arpaio when serious casting problems set in.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Arpaio sees Robert DeNiro or Al Pacino in the title role of a
film to be based on his book, America's Toughest Sheriff, though he
says he's willing to settle for Joe Pesci.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, producers have floated the name of Roseanne's
ex-husband, Tom Arnold, perhaps because the late Jackie Gleason
isn't available to reprise the Sheriff Buford T. Justice character
he perfected in Smokey and the Bandit.
</P>
<P>
   And that's just the beginning of the casting quandary.
</P>
<P>
   Who will play Arpaio's right-hand man, double-dipping Deputy
Dave Hendershott?
</P>
<P>
   Don Knotts is still alive, but anyone who knows Hendershott can
tell you Knotts isn't a big enough actor to fill the deputy's
shoes, or any other part of his wardrobe. Still, the role cries out
for the performer who immortalized Barney Fife.
</P>
<P>
   After all, the chief executive officer of Desert Winds
production company told The Republic that the movie of Arpaio's
life will be ``cute or fun.``
</P>
<P>
   But what about David Michael Pecard? Who'll play the AWOL
soldier from Fort Huachuca who talked his way into the sheriff's
inner circle, obtained keys, a badge and an office, and even posed
as Arpaio's bodyguard?
</P>
<P>
   I hear O.J.'s available.
</P>
<P>
   Then there are the deputies who say they were forced out of
their jobs by henchmen trying to purge news leaks from the
Sheriff's Office? Perhaps they could play themselves. They need the
work.
</P>
<P>
   Who'll get the ``cute or fun'' role of Wayne Bates, the postal
worker who was hauled off to jail in front of TV cameras for using
pepper spray on a pair of fenced-in dogs? No charges were filed,
though Bates did file a whopping lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   And who will they cast as Tim Griffin, a one-time inmate at
Joe's jail who was denied medical treatment for a perforated ulcer
after begging for help? A Superior Court jury ordered the county to
pay him $1.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   Who'll play George E. Sullivan and Gene Miller, experts who
produced reports on the brutality in Joe's lockups?
</P>
<P>
   A convincing young actor is needed to portray Jeremy Flanders.
He was beaten by inmates at Joe's Tent City jail and later awarded
more than $900,000.
</P>
<P>
   And what about Richard Post? He's a paraplegic abused while in
sheriff's custody and later paid $800,000. There aren't many actors
who can do ``cute or fun'' from a wheelchair, particularly when
being roughed up.
</P>
<P>
   It'll be especially difficult to cast the part of County
Attorney Rick Romley. The local prosecutor recently joined the long
list of those who've filed suit against Arpaio. It's all part of a
two-man feud that's been nastier, longer-running and more
entertaining than the one made famous by Boss Hogg and the Dukes of
Hazzard.
</P>
<P>
   Then, there's the problZ}'' &QC;  &QC; financing. Movies are expensive
propositions. They require the
support of wealthy investors.
</P>
<P>
   I'm personally acquainted with a nice couple who recently came
into $8.25 million. Jaron and Deena Norberg received the cash from
Maricopa County to settle a lawsuit they'd filed after their son
died horribly at the hands of Joe's guards.
</P>
<P>
   Trouble is, even if some of that $8.25 million was used to solve
money problems for producers of the ``cute or fun'' movie they'd
still be left with a tricky casting dilemma.
</P>
<P>
   Who'll play Scott Norberg? &QL;

`COATMAN' IN MARATHON AGAIN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RICH HAMMOND  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The Los Angeles Marathon has always featured a
cast of characters, runners far back in the pack who concern
themselves more with entertaining their fellow participants than
finishing in a respectable time.
</P>
<P>
   With the possible exception of the ``pancake-flipping man,''
whose moniker accurately describes his gimmick, Dennis ``Coatman''
Marsella might have earned the most fame for running in Los
Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Marsella, a resident of Fort Lauderdale, Fla., will run his 14th
Los Angeles Marathon on Sunday, and has completed the last 75
marathons he has entered, despite the fact he wears a shirt, tie
and overcoat over his shorts on the course.
</P>
<P>
   Marsella estimated the temperature inside the coat can top 100
degrees, which begs the obvious question: ``Why?''
</P>
<P>
   ``In 1981, while I was a lifeguard, I got the idea,'' Marsella
told the Fort Lauderdale Sun-Sentinel. ``I read a book about core
temperature and running, along with resistance against the air.
</P>
<P>
   ``I figured this would be the most insane thing you could do _
to run a 26-mile marathon with a coat on. It's a stunt and I
thought it would be a world record.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's spiritual motivation and I consider myself a performance
artist. I'm not just a runner. I also incorporate modern dance into
my running. You have to look at me like a figure skater. I like to
perform my art and I like to notoriety that comes with it. I get
satisfaction from what I do.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Staying the course: The course remains unchanged for the
second consecutive year, largely because the men's record was
broken last year by Simon Bor of Kenya.
</P>
<P>
   Race president Dr. William Burke was desperate for a new record,
which he called his ``holy grail'' at one point and promised to
make changes if a new record was not set, but Bor's time of 2
hours, 9 minutes and 25 seconds dismissed talk of a new course.
</P>
<P>
   The course bottoms out at an altitude of 157 feet in the seventh
mile, just north of Exposition Park, and climbs to a peak of 401
feet at the 20th mile, near Hollywood and Vine. The closing miles
feature a slow and steady descent, with a finish in front of the
Central Public Library on Flower between Fifth and Sixth Streets.

CLINTON TO BLOCK EUROPE'S CHOICE TO LEAD IMF 
</HEADLINE>
   (SUBS to change `putting' to `most likely casting' in lede graf.
Inserts sentence immediately before first optional trim.)  
(mk) 
 By JOSEPH KAHN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton has vowed to block the man Europe
wants to head the International Monetary Fund, setting off a
possibly protracted contest for control of the financial
institution and most likely casting the United States in the role
of kingmaker.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's rejection of Caio Koch-Weser, a German Finance
Ministry official, makes the succession at the IMF the biggest
battle for leadership of a major international institution since
the United States fought to oust U.N. Secretary-General Boutros
Boutros-Ghali and replace him with Kofi Annan in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration says that in an era when financial
crises can spread at Internet speed from country to country, the
German candidate does not have what it takes to be the world's
chief financial firefighter.
</P>
<P>
   The decision, relayed by Clinton in a phone call to German
Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder on Saturday and made public Monday,
challenges the automatic European prerogative to choose the leader
of the IMF, a tradition that began when the fund was created just
after World War II.
</P>
<P>
   But the Clinton administration has so far declined to rub it in
by backing the sole American contender for the job, leaving open
the possibility that Europe could still hold onto the position by
putting forth another candidate of greater stature to succeed
Michel Camdessus as managing director of the fund.
</P>
<P>
   The American, Stanley Fischer, the No. 2 official at the fund,
was nominated by an unusual coalition of African and Arab countries
and has demonstrated the skill to head the fund, backers say. But
the Clinton administration seems likely to withhold support for
him, at least initially, fearing that Europe might cripple the fund
rather than see leadership pass to an American.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Europe is standing by Koch-Weser, who has benefited from
an aggressive German lobbying campaign over the last three months.
Though Clinton told Schroeder of firm U.S opposition on Saturday,
European finance ministers, meeting in Brussels, Belgium, on
Monday, announced formal backing for Koch-Weser, with some
ministers indicating that American pressure helped them rally
around the European choice. And some European officials think his
candidacy could succeed despite U.S. objections.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The dance over IMF succession shows how complex it is to select
leaders of world institutions at a time when globalization is
racing ahead _ and when resistance to the spread of American-style
capitalism and Western ideas appears to be mounting in tandem.
</P>
<P>
   Since the monetary fund intervened in many of the largest
developing countries in the late 1990s to help them grapple with
the spread of financial panic that began in Asia, its power to
influence how nations manage their economies and their currencies
is by some measures at an all-time high.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the process of selecting a leader for the fund is stuck in a
half-century-old global mind-set, when Europe and the United States
controlled nearly every important international position and, in
the case of the IMF and the World Bank, simply divided the posts
between them like members of a gentleman's club.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration's rejection of Koch-Weser and its
decision not to throw support behind Fischer _ a combination one
observer called a ``half-pregnant'' assertion of American power _
shook that tradition but did not shatter it.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The United States has signaled that it wants Europe to select
someone more senior and experienced than Koch-Weser, but has made
it clear to European officials that it does not intend to deny them
the right to choose.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``On the one hand America is saying that we should find a better
candidate,'' says C. Fred Bergsten, who heads the Institute of
International Economics and has studied ways of reforming the IMF.
``On the other hand, we are passing up a golden opportunity to end
this anachronism and really open up the process.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The American position leaves the selection process in limbo,
raising the prospect that none of the three candidates nominated
for the job will ultimately get it. The Japanese have nominated
Eisuke Sakakibara, a former high-level Finance Ministry official
known by the nickname ``Mr. Yen.''
</P>
<P>
   IMF board members may begin informal voting later this week,
taking a straw poll to determine whether any of the candidates has
strong support. It is still possible that one of the candidates
could gather enough support to force a formal vote. Supporters of
Fischer and Koch-Weser are working to line up support from
developing countries and to generate momentum.
</P>
<P>
   Voting power at the IMF is determined primarily by the amount of
money donor nations contribute. The United States has a 19 percent
share, more than any other single nation. The European Union has 37
percent of the votes if the 15 nations that make up that block vote
together. In practice, member nations have tended to favor those
who command considerably more than a simple majority of the votes.
</P>
<P>
   Koch-Weser, a 25-year veteran of the World Bank and an expert in
development policies, still vows to win the post. With Europe's
firm backing now in hand, he said he intended to recruit support
from developing countries. He counts China and Brazil among his
early backers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The endorsement from all the ministers came late, but it was
encouraging,'' Koch-Weser said in a phone interview. ``Now we have
to go out and mobilize support from the member governments, and I
am quite confident that we can do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of Fischer, the deputy managing director, argue that
he has a good shot as well.
</P>
<P>
   Although he's Jewish and American, his candidacy was first
broached by Angola and backed by Iraq and Syria, among nearly two
dozen developing country thought to favor him for the job. Because
the fund focuses on helping poor countries cope with capitalism,
supportfrom a diverse array of developing nations is seen as
crucial.
</P>
<P>
   Fischer, a soft-spoken technocrat who ran the fund day to day
under Camdessus, also has had a long and close relationship with
Treasury Secretary Lawrence H. Summers. Fischer once taught Summers
at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Some Europeans think
that the United States secretly supports Fischer, a view Clinton
administration officials dismiss as a conspiracy theory with no
grounding in reality.
</P>
<P>
   Some administration officials do seem partial to Fischer but
fear that the IMF would become a trans-Atlantic political football
if they sought to install an American in the top post. European
nations put up most of the money for the fund, meaning that they
could hobble its activities if they felt it had become an American
protectorate. The Clinton administration also feels that it does
not lack for influence at the fund as things stand.
</P>
<P>
   With the United States withholding its imprimatur on any of the
current candidates, the most likely outcome is for the first round
of jockeying to end in stalemate. Clinton administration officials
say that they hope that will prompt Europe to withdraw Koch-Weser
from contention and produce a new candidate who would then move
into the job with American support.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Publicly, there are no other European contenders for the job.
But were European officials to withdraw Koch-Weser's nomination,
the speculation is that they would be inclined to nominate someone
of significantly higher political stature, in part to save German
face.
</P>
<P>
   Among the long list of possible replacement candidates are
Gordon Brown, Britain's current chancellor of the exchequer;
Giuliano Amato, the Italian treasury secretary; Mario Draghi, the
Italian treasury director, and Andrew Crockett, who heads the Bank
for International Settlements in Basel, Switzerland.

MUSEUM SUES IN BID TO KEEP METEORITE 
</HEADLINE>

Bergstein.)

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The American Museum of Natural History asked a
federal court in Manhattan on Monday to declare the museum the
rightful owner of one of its oldest and most treasured exhibits,
the 15-ton Willamette Meteorite, which an Indian group in Oregon is
claiming as a sacred tribal object.
</P>
<P>
   The Indian group, the Confederated Tribes of the Grand Ronde
Community of Oregon, has formally requested the return of the
meteorite under a federal law that allows for the repatriation of
Native American cultural and religious artifacts from museums that
receive government money.
</P>
<P>
   But the museum contends that the meteorite, which is believed to
have fallen to earth 10,000 years ago from the asteroid belt
between Mars and Jupiter, is not the kind of sacred object covered
by the law, known as the Native American Graves Protection and
Repatriation Act of 1990.
</P>
<P>
   In its lawsuit filed in U.S. District Court in Manhattan, the
museum contends that the meteorite, which was found in the Upper
Willamette Valley in Oregon, was ``a natural feature of the
landscape, rather than a specific ceremonial object,'' as described
in the law.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel we have a strong case under the law,'' said Evan A.
Davis, a lawyer for the museum, which has placed the meteorite
prominently in its $210 million Rose Center for Earth and Space,
which opened recently to large crowds and enthusiastic reviews.
</P>
<P>
   The meteorite, which sits on a steel pedestal in the
planetarium's Cullman Hall of the Universe, is so big that parts of
the museum had to be built around it, officials have said. The
museum bought it for $20,600 in 1906 from Oregon Iron and Steel
Co., which owned the land on which it was found.
</P>
<P>
   The land had been given up voluntarily by various Indian tribes
in an 1855 treaty with the United States in exchange for
reservation land and other considerations, the lawsuit said.
</P>
<P>
   Leonard J. Bergstein, a spokesman for the tribes, said the
confederation was shocked that the museum ``insists on illegally
keeping this sacred object, which belongs to the history and
culture of the Grand Ronde people.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The museum should do the right thing,'' he said, ``and resolve
this dispute now directly with our tribes, instead of marching us
off to a court behind a squadron of attorneys.''
</P>
<P>
   Neil deGrasse Tyson, the director of the planetarium, estimated
that 40 million to 50 million people have seen the meteorite,
including ``untold numbers of visitors who were turned on to
science because of their encounter with this meteorite.''
