<HEADLINE> Cubans Rally For Return of Elian  </HEADLINE>
By ANITA SNOW, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   HAVANA (AP) -- As a U.S. government deadline neared for Elian'
Gonzalez's Miami relatives, tens of thousands of Cubans gathered in
a central city on Saturday to demand that the 6-year-old be
returned to his father on the island.
</P>
<P>
   State media said an estimated 50,000 pro-government
demonstrators gathered for the rally in the city of Sagua la
Grande, in Villa Clara province. Broadcasting the event live,
government television showed tens of thousand of people wearing
T-shirts featuring Elian's portrait and waving a sea of red, white
and blue Cuban flags
</P>
<P>
   In the audience was Gen. Raul Castro Ruz, head of Cuba's Armed
Forces and the No. 2 man in the communist government behind his
brother President Fidel Castro. Also on hand was Juan Almeida
Bosque, one of the original revolutionary commanders during the
revolution that triumphed in 1959 and a trusted Castro adviser.
</P>
<P>
   With poems, speeches, songs and dance, the demonstrators called
for Elian's return in the latest of scores of such rallies since
the boy became a cause celebre after being rescued at sea off the
coast of Florida four months ago.
</P>
<P>
   The afternoon rally was held a day after the U.S. federal
government set a new Monday deadline for Elian's Miami relatives to
agree to a speedy appeal -- or else the boy will be swiftly returned
to his father.
</P>
<P>
   Elian has been at the center of an international custody dispute
since fishermen found him lashed to an innertube after a boating
accident that took the life of his mother and 10 others.
</P>
<P>
   While the child's father and four grandparents have demanded
that he be returned to Cuba, Elian's Miami relatives are fighting
to keep him in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the relatives, Armando Gutierrez, said family
members will meet with their lawyers over the weekend to discuss
the case.
</P>
<P>
   The Miami relatives were meeting with their attorneys over the
weekend to decide how to respond to Washington's latest ultimatum.
</P>
<P>
   If the U.S. Justice Department's new deadline is rejected, Elian
could be headed back to Cuba this week.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department, through the Immigration and
naturalization Service, is closely watching the family's response.
Members of Miami's large Cuban exile community have threatened
street protests if the U.S. government moves to return the boy to
his father in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General Janet Reno confirmed a new deadline in a
statement Friday night, but offered no details. She repeated that
''our goal is to reunite Elian with his father in a fair, prompt
and orderly manner.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department speedup came in the wake of a federal
judge's decision Tuesday affirming the INS' January decision to
send the 6-year-old back to his father in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   The Cuban government has cautioned citizens not to get too
hopeful, reminding them that the child's return has been delayed
repeatedly by a series of legal maneuvers in the United States.

<HEADLINE> Georgia 83, North Carolina 57  </HEADLINE>
By LANDON HALL, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) -- Tawana McDonald had 18 points and Coco
Miller had 17 as top-seeded Georgia used a punishing inside game to
beat North Carolina 83-57 Saturday night in the NCAA women's West
Regional semifinals.
</P>
<P>
   Shala Crawford had 16 points and Deana Nolan added 13 for the
Lady Bulldogs (32-3), who are one victory away from their fourth
Final Four appearance in six years.
</P>
<P>
   The Bulldogs play the Rutgers-Alabama-Birmingham winner in
Monday's regional championship.
</P>
<P>
   Juana Brown had 19 points and Jackie Higgins 14 to lead the
fifth-seeded Tar Heels (20-13), who had won eight of nine.
</P>
<P>
   North Carolina's leading scorers, LaQuanda Barksdale and Nikki
Teasley, scored just six points each -- a combined 21 below their
season averages. Barksdale averaged 25 in the first two tournament
games. Teasley had her confidence shaken early by missing a couple
layups.
</P>
<P>
   The Tar Heels had no one to stop McDonald and Crawford, both
6-foot-4. North Carolina has only one player taller than 6-1 -- 6-5
LaShonda Allen, a sophomore who was overmatched inside.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia led by 13 at halftime and needed less than six minutes
of the second half to push it to 20. Coco Miller hit a 3-pointer
and a jumper, twin sister Kelly Miller hit two jumpers and McDonald
sank four free throws to make it 56-35 with 14:07 left.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia took an 11-4 lead on a pass breakup by Kelly Miller and
a layup by Coco Miller. The Tar Heels came back to tie it at 17 on
a jumper by Barksdale, but North Carolina didn't lead again.
</P>
<P>
   A putback by Higgins pulled the Heels within 25-21, but Georgia
went on a 9-0 run, all the points coming from inside.
</P>
<P>
   North Carolina got within 11 on a 3-pointer by Coretta Brown and
a fast-break layup by Teasley, but Coco Miller's short jumper with
three seconds left gave the Lady Bulldogs a 41-28 halftime lead.

<HEADLINE> Gridiron Club Pummels the Powerful  </HEADLINE>
By LAWRENCE L. KNUTSON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- They beat Al Gore like a drum, thrashed
through the bushes in search of George W. and shook Bill Clinton's
tree.
</P>
<P>
   For the 115th year, journalism's Gridiron Club proved Saturday
night it is possible to scorch the mighty and break bread with them
at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Gore, sitting in for the traveling President
Clinton, delivered the evening's final comedic address, insisting
it was possible to take credit for the administration's successes
without being blamed for its failures.
</P>
<P>
   The trick, he said, is all in how you explain it:
</P>
<P>
   ''A low unemployment rate and a sound economy? Clinton-Gore.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Grand jury testimony? Clinton.''
</P>
<P>
   ''The largest deficit in the nation's history turned into the
largest surplus? Clinton-Gore.''
</P>
<P>
   ''The impeachment? Not me.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore also poked fund at the controversy surronding his
fund-raising activities in 1996. ''This isn't a fund-raiser, is
it?'' he deadpanned as the white-tie crowd broke into laugher. ''My
antenna goes straight up when everyody is wearing the same thing.''
</P>
<P>
   This was a sly reference to his visit to a Buddist temple.
</P>
<P>
   The highlight of the night, however, was the surprise appearance
of five female Cabinet-level officials, wearing Superman outfits,
to sing a parody: ''Thank Heaven For Grown Up Girls.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Without us, what would Cabinet boys do,'' sang Health and
Human Services Secretary Donna Shalala, Labor Secretary Alexis
Herman, Attorney General Janet Reno, Trade Representative Charlene
Barshefsky and Aida Alvarez, head of the Small Business
Administration.
</P>
<P>
   Former Democratic Party chairman Robert Strauss joked about both
Gore and the putative Republican presidential nominee, George W.
Bush.
</P>
<P>
   He chided Gore for a habit of padding his resume, saying, ''I
had no idea he saved John McCain's life in that prison camp.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the Republican, he said: ''George W. Bush thought fettuccine
alfredo was the president of Italy.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's absence did not let it did not escape the Gridiron's
notice that he soon will be an ex-president at the tender age of
54:
</P>
<P>
   ''Bimbo eruptions, who's gonna care -- when you're out the door?
</P>
<P>
   ''Who's gonna hiss you, or even miss you,
</P>
<P>
   ''When you're 54.''
</P>
<P>
   First lady Hillary Rodham Clinton, jousting with New York Mayor
Rudy Giuliani for New York's open U.S. Senate seat, was portrayed
in silver armor, her helmeted head encircled by a shining golden
halo, while singing a version of the song ''My Way'':
</P>
<P>
   ''Oh, there were times, I'm sure you know, Bill's bimbo flings,
began to show. But even though, there was no doubt, I couldn't
throw, the pres-dent out.
</P>
<P>
   ''So I flipped on my loving gaze -- 'cause that is MY way.''
</P>
<P>
   The Giuliani character, referring to his opponent as ''that
White House carpetbag,'' got some of the evening's sharper lines:
</P>
<P>
   As in, ''Ain't I sweet? Kickin' homeless off the street.''
</P>
<P>
   And: ''I've had enough. My cops can play it rough. If they blow
away an unarmed immigrant, that's just tough.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans got the first serving at the white-tie-and-tails
dinner, a Washington perennial since President Grover Cleveland's
first term in the late 1880s.
</P>
<P>
   The Gridiron chorus and singers served up a dollop of fun-poking
at the primary season just past. They portrayed Sen. John McCain,
for example, in a scorched and smoke-stained Navy dress white
uniform and Pat Buchanan as a bare-chested Prussian soldier,
complete with spiked helmet.
</P>
<P>
   The portrayer of Texas Gov. Bush denied that he is dumb, even
while admitting that his grasp of details might seem ''maybe a
half-bubble off plumb.''
</P>
<P>
   A bit of GOP primary advice: ''You've got to accentuate the
negative -- Tell folks it's really positive, Compassionate,
Conservative -- Don't mess with nuthin' in between.''
</P>
<P>
   The chorus defines the GOP version of compassionate: ''We're for
smokers and soft money, golden living for gun dealers, tax cuts for
the wealthy classes, executions for the masses, Compassionate.''
</P>
<P>
   The singer playing House Speaker Dennis Hastert parodied the
song ''Bless this House'':
</P>
<P>
   ''Keep this House for guys like me, vote for mediocrity.''
</P>
<P>
   In the show's second half, Democrats got equal time.
</P>
<P>
   Gore: ''All across the country, he made promises galore. He was
never one to shrink from pandering.''
</P>
<P>
   Bill Bradley: ''Campaigns are funny. You never know why voters
elect the wrong guy.''
</P>
<P>
   And a torch song, to a guy named Bill, from a certain young
woman named Monica:
</P>
<P>
   ''Are you lonesome tonight? Do you miss me tonight? ... Does the
Oval Office seem empty and bare? When you're working the rope line
do you picture me there? Is your heart filled with pain. Shall I
come back again ...?

<HEADLINE> Jazz 84, Grizzlies 75  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   VANCOUVER, British Columbia (AP) -- Karl Malone had 25 points and
14 rebounds and the Utah Jazz used tight defense down the stretch
Saturday night to secure a sloppy 84-75 victory over the Vancouver
Grizzlies.
</P>
<P>
   Malone recorded his 38th double-double of the season despite
hitting just 9 of 25 from the field.
</P>
<P>
   Utah held Vancouver without a field goal for 4:42 late in the
fourth quarter en route to winning for the 20th time in 23 outings.
</P>
<P>
   It was also Utah's 11th win in its last 14 road games, and
enabled the Jazz to maintain their 3{-game lead atop the Midwest
Division.
</P>
<P>
   Dennis Scott scored 16 points to lead the Grizzlies, who have
lost 13 of 14.
</P>
<P>
   Neither team shot well, with Utah finishing the game at 41.9
percent and Vancouver at 35.4.
</P>
<P>
   Vancouver's starting guards, Mike Bibby and Michael Dickerson,
missed all 12 shots they took in the first half, while Utah's John
Stockton and Jeff Hornacek were a combined 3-for-12.
</P>
<P>
   The teams went to the break tied at 34.
</P>
<P>
   The Grizzlies' lone offensive push early came from an unexpected
source. Antoine Carr, playing his first game since Jan. 26,
combined with Scott to score 22 points in the half, just two fewer
than Utah's starting unit.
</P>
<P>
   Vancouver, which beat the Jazz the last time the teams played
for the franchise's first win over Utah, stayed in contention until
the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Utah coach Jerry Sloan was ejected at 9:33 of the third
period for picking up his second technical. ... Vancouver grabbed
22 rebounds in the first quarter, a team record for a quarter. ...
The Grizzlies played their first game without forward Grant Long,
who was lost for the season when he cracked a bone in his right
hand during practice Thursday. ... The Grizzlies began play
Saturday with 175 man-games lost to injury. Utah's total this
season: nine games.

<HEADLINE> Canada Party Votes For New Alliance  </HEADLINE>
By TOM COHEN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   CALGARY (AP) -- A political gamble to unify Canada's divided
right passed a critical test Saturday when the nation's
second-largest party voted to join a new conservative alliance.
</P>
<P>
   The resounding approval by the Reform Party, the official
opposition in Parliament, to enter the Canadian Reform Conservative
Alliance altered Canada's political landscape by bringing together
formerly divided conservative groups to take on the governing
Liberal Party in national elections expected in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   The political alliance creates a right-wing party with potential
nationwide support to take on the governing Liberal Party in
national elections expected in 2001. In the past two federal
elections, the Reform and Conservative parties split much of the
right-wing vote while the Liberals cruised to victory.
</P>
<P>
   Even with the Reform Party shoring up its support base, the
Canadian Alliance faces obstacles to generating a widespread
following across the country. While some Conservative Party
officials have joined up, leader Joe Clark rejects the alliance and
his party will contest the federal election independently.
</P>
<P>
   An independent auditing firm spent Saturday tallying ballots
mailed in by most of the Reform Party's 75,000 members. A
two-thirds majority of the total vote was required for approval,
along with majority support in at least six of the 11 provinces and
territories where voting held.
</P>
<P>
   Reform leader Preston Manning announced the results to a packed
ballroom saying that 91 percent of the 48,838 ballots supported
joining the alliance. The response was from 66.5 percent of the
total party membership and the proposal was approved in every
province and territory.
</P>
<P>
   ''We resolve to work together with you to create a bigger
national revolution to remove the unprincipled Liberals from
office,'' Manning said.
</P>
<P>
   The goal of the alliance created in January was to combine the
Reform Party with supporters of the Conservative Party to create a
rightist movement capable of toppling the Liberals.
</P>
<P>
   Even before the referendum results were known, the campaign to
lead the Canadian Alliance had started.
</P>
<P>
   Manning and Alberta Treasurer Stockwell Day of the Conservative
Party previously declared their candidacies, with at least three
others expressing interest.
</P>
<P>
   Manning, the politically ambitious son of a former Alberta
premier, has led the Reform Party since its creation in 1987 as a
Western protest movement against domination and disinterest by the
eastern political establishment, then headed by the Conservatives.
</P>
<P>
   The Reform Party eventually grew enough to make Manning
opposition leader in Parliament, but it never won meaningful
support outside of its Western base.
</P>
<P>
   Realizing he needed votes from central and eastern regions to
topple the governing Liberals, Manning spearheaded the unity plan
to merge his Western support with the Conservatives' backing in
Ontario, the most populous province, and points east.
</P>
<P>
   While both parties agree on fiscal discipline, lower taxes and
other conservative economic principles, the Reform Party's
reputation for extremist views on social issues such as immigration
and gay rights has made it unpalatable to more mainstream
Conservative supporters.
</P>
<P>
   A policy platform adopted at the Canadian Alliance's founding
conference in January included concessions from some previous
Reform positions.
</P>
<P>
   One policy accepted Canada's two national languages of French
and English. The Reform Party has opposed special official status
for the French language, the most volatile issue in Francophone
Quebec.
</P>
<P>
   But deep enmity between the parties lingers, particularly at the
top. Manning has a long-standing rivalry with Conservative leader
Joe Clark, another aspirant for the prime minister's office who
rejects the alliance.
</P>
<P>
   For the governing Liberal Party, the prospect of a unified right
caused some parliament members to publicly suggest two-term Prime
Minister Jean Chretien should step aside so fresh leadership could
contest the next election.
</P>
<P>
   Bolstered by a strong economy and dormant separatist aspirations
in Quebec, Chretien insists he can fulfill a personal ambition to
win a third term, saying the inherent conservatism of the Canadian
Alliance differs from the basic nature of Canadians.

<HEADLINE> Penn State 66, Iowa St. 65  </HEADLINE>
By CHUCK SCHOFFNER, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- Helen Darling made sure that Penn State
stayed in the race for the national championship.
</P>
<P>
   Darling scored the winning basket with 12.6 seconds left and
finished with 21 points to lift Penn State to a 66-65 victory over
Iowa State on Saturday night in the NCAA Midwest Regional
semifinals.
</P>
<P>
   The second-seeded Lady Lions (29-4) recovered just in time after
a blowing a 12-point lead and will play top-seeded Louisiana Tech
in the regional final Monday night. Louisiana Tech advanced with an
86-74 victory over Old Dominion.
</P>
<P>
   It will be Penn State's first appearance in the final eight
since 1994. The Lady Lions have never been to the Final Four.
</P>
<P>
   Urged on by thousands of fans who made the three-hour trip from
central Iowa, Iowa State (27-6) rallied after trailing most of the
second half and led 65-64 after Angie Welle sank two free throws
with 27.8 seconds left.
</P>
<P>
   Penn State's Andrea Garner then missed a jump shot from the left
baseline and Megan Taylor seemed to have the rebound for Iowa State
to the right of the basket. But Darling stripped the ball from
Taylor and her shot bounced up off the front of the rim and rolled
back in.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor missed a running jumper from just inside the free throw
line at the buzzer.
</P>
<P>
   Garner, Penn State's shortest starter at 5-feet-7, also had 11
rebounds, six assists and three steals. Maren Walseth added 14
points for the Lady Lions.
</P>
<P>
   Lindsey Wilson led Iowa State with 15 points and Desiree Francis
scored 14.
</P>
<P>
   Ahead 36-32 at halftime, Penn State opened a 46-34 lead on
back-to-back 3-pointers by Chrissy Falcone and seemed to be
comfortably ahead at 57-47 with 10 minutes to play.
</P>
<P>
   But Wilson, a freshman, sparked Iowa State with strong drives to
the basket and the Cyclones stormed back.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson scored twice and Welle had six points in a 14-2 run that
pulled Iowa State into a 61-59 lead with 3:25 left. It was 63-61
Iowa State after Stacy Frese fed Tracy Gahan for a layup, but
misses on the next two possessions by the Cyclones gave Penn State
a chance and it capitalized.
</P>
<P>
   Walseth sank a free throw then made a nice wraparound pass to
Garner for a layup that put Penn State ahead 64-63 with 1:32
remaining. Welle's two free throws then gave Iowa State its final
lead.
</P>
<P>
   Both teams had key players on the bench for long stretches in
the first half because of fouls, and it hurt Iowa State more.
</P>
<P>
   Francis, Iowa State's No. 3 scorer, went to the bench for the
final 15:53 of the half and Welle, the team's leading scorer, did
not play the final 10:17.
</P>
<P>
   Garner, Penn State's top scorer, sat out the final 11:29.
</P>
<P>
   With Iowa State's two key inside players on the bench, Penn
State outrebounded the Cyclones 27-16 in the opening half and that
helped the Lady Lions rally from a 22-13 deficit.
</P>
<P>
   Penn State went on a 16-2 run keyed by outstanding defense and
free throw shooting to take a 29-24 lead. Iowa State regained the
lead at 32-30 on Erica Haugen's 3-pointer and Wilson's two free
throws, but Penn State scored the final six points of the half.
</P>
<P>
   Penn finished with a 42-33 rebounding advantage, including 16
offensive rebounds that produced 14 second-chance points.

   MOSCOW (AP) -- Weary of chaos and government corruption, Russians are

hoping the ex-KGB spy can clean up the country and restore it as a world power
without rolling back democratic reforms. With a Putin presidency seen as
inevitable by most Russians, the question is what he plans for the world's

voters backing him, with Communist leader Gennady Zyuganov far behind with about
20 percent.

Syrian President Hafez el-Assad. Berger said Sunday's meeting of the two leaders
was unlikely to produce an immediate resumption of Syrian-Israeli negotiations,
which broke off in January. Instead, he said, the hope is that the two sides
''over the next few weeks will reach the conclusion that they can enter into a
serious round of negotiation. But that's by no means certain.''

   RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) -- Reform Judaism is poised for a vote that could make it
the most influential U.S. religious group to support clergy who perform same-sex
unions. A resolution sanctioning commitment ceremonies is expected to come up at
the Central Conference of American Rabbis convention starting Sunday in
Greensboro. Supporters believe rabbis should affirm committed relationships
between Jewish gays and lesbians as sacred, just like Jewish marriage. While the
conference supports civil same-sex unions and approved openly gay rabbis a
decade ago, some homosexuals say they still feel like second-class citizens at
temple. The resolution would give religious legitimacy to same-sex unions.

Gas Prices Rise a Half Cent
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Gasoline prices edged up a mere half a cent in the past
two weeks, and the increases may be coming to an end, an industry analyst said
Saturday. The average retail price of all grades of gasoline, including taxes,
was about $1.59 per gallon as of Friday, an increase of only a half cent from
March 10, according to the Lundberg Survey of 10,000 stations nationwide. While
the nationwide average cost of gas rose half a penny, there are starkly
different regional trends. For example, ''Prices are down more than 6 cents in
the Midwest but up nearly a dime in the West,'' analysts said.

Wisconsin Reaches Final Four
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. (AP) -- Coach Dick Bennett's eighth-seeded Wisconsin
Badgers put on another clinic of precision passing and pressure defense Saturday
to beat Purdue for the third time this season, 64-60, and complete an unlikely
rise from sixth place in the Big Ten to champions of the NCAA West Regional. The
Badgers (22-13), whose only big-time basketball success came when they won the
NCAA title in 1941, became the lowest-seeded team to advance to the Final Four
since 1986 when LSU made it as a No. 11 seed. Wisconsin will play Michigan
State, 75-64 winners over Iowa State in the Midwest final in Auburn Hills, Mich.

<HEADLINE> Pistons 126, Clippers 107  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Jerry Stackhouse scored 31 points and the
Detroit Pistons breezed to a 126-107 victory over the Los Angeles
Clippers on Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   Lindsey Hunter had 20 points and Grant Hill added 19 for the
Pistons, who beat the Clippers for the eighth straight time and
improved to 8-3 since George Irvine replaced Alvin Gentry as coach.
</P>
<P>
   Detroit remains a game behind Charlotte for sixth place in the
Eastern Conference playoff race. The victory increased the lead
over Orlando to 3{ games for seventh place.
</P>
<P>
   Tyrone Nesby scored 22 points and Michael Olowokandi and Eric
Piatkowski had 21 each for the Clippers, who have lost seven
straight.
</P>
<P>
   The Clippers were down to nine healthy players. Their top two
scorers, Maurice Taylor (ankle) and rookie Lamar Odom (leg) sat out
and backup center Keith Closs was a late scratch after experiencing
an asthma attack during warmups.
</P>
<P>
   Trailing by as many as 24 points with less than four minutes
left in the second quarter, the Clippers got as close as 77-66 with
a 14-7 run capped by Piatkowski's two free throws with 7:22 left in
the third.
</P>
<P>
   Hunter, who made eight of his first nine shots, responded with a
3-pointer 18 seconds later and the Pistons increased the margin to
98-83 on a dunk at the buzzer by Stackhouse. Los Angeles got no
closer than 15 points in the fourth quarter.
Notes: Detroit forward Loy Vaught, who led the Clippers in scoring
for three consecutive seasons and in rebounding for four straight
years, has played in only 74 of 119 games since joining the Pistons
in January 1999 as a free agent. Vaught, who has played at least 73
games in each of his seven NBA seasons, was scoreless in six
minutes. ... The Clippers are the only team in the league this
season that has not played an overtime game. ... The Pistons have
only five road victories this season against Western Conference
teams, four during this five-game trip. ... The Clippers are 2-43
when they've trailed at halftime, 0-16 at home.

<HEADLINE> Spring Training Roundup  </HEADLINE>
The Associated Press
<TEXT>
<P>
   Kenny Lofton and Curt Schilling might be returning sooner than
expected.
</P>
<P>
   Lofton, playing his first game since undergoing shoulder surgery
in December, reached base three times and scored twice Saturday in
his first action this spring as Cleveland beat Detroit 7-3 in
Winter Haven, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   Lofton wasn't expected to be back with the Indians until the
All-Star break. But to nearly everyone's surprise, the six-time
All-Star center fielder was back in the Indians' lineup, going
1-for-3 with a single, two walks and a strikeout.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm feeling good physically,'' he said. ''But it's still a
day-to-day thing. I can't say I'm surprised that I came back this
quickly because I've never had any kind of surgery like this
before.''
</P>
<P>
   He had been limited to about 25 at-bats in minor league games
during training camp before batting leadoff as the Indians'
designated hitter against the Tigers.
</P>
<P>
   Lofton began a throwing program earlier this month to strengthen
the rotator cuff he tore while diving headfirst into first base
during last year's playoffs against Boston.
</P>
<P>
   He can throw a ball about 150 feet on a line, but he isn't well
enough to play center yet. But with the way he's progressing, it
appears Lofton may begin the regular season on Cleveland's 25-man
roster.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's getting close to playing, but we don't want to have a
setback,'' Indians manager Charlie Manuel said.
</P>
<P>
   Schilling continued his rapid comeback from shoulder surgery
Dec. 13. He threw for 15 minutes in the bullpen in Clearwater,
Fla., then announced he would face hitters for the first time
Monday. He's lobbying for a chance to pitch at least an inning in
the Phillies' final exhibition game April 2 in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's not going to happen,'' said Phillies manager Terry
Francona, who added that Schilling will pitch in some kind of game
in Florida ''pretty soon after that.''
</P>
<P>
   Schilling's doctor, Craig Morgan, said he could beat projections
of returning in May by as much as two weeks. The 33-year-old ace
had his right shoulder capsule tightened, and he and Morgan agree
he could come back better than ever.
</P>
<P>
   After his bullpen session, Schilling watched Pedro Martinez
overpower some of Philadelphia's best hitters before the Phillies
came back to beat the Boston Red Sox 10-4.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez struck out six in 4 2-3 innings. He allowed two runs
and six hits and walked one. Afterward, he turned up the
expectations in the Red Sox clubhouse just a notch.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've gotten pretty much everything that you can get,'' said
Martinez, who had one of the best seasons in baseball history last
year. ''I've been to All-Star games, I've struggled, I've had
success. I've had all kinds of things. I need to win. I want to see
Boston, what it's like when we win it.''
</P>
<P>
   In other games:
</P>
<P>
Royals 11, Braves 4
</P>
<P>
   At Kissimmee, Fla., Johnny Damon hit a pair of home runs
Saturday, including a three-run shot in an eight-run first inning
against Atlanta's projected fifth starter Bruce Chen. John Rocker
pitched one scoreless inning of relief.
</P>
<P>
Yankees 7, Marlins 5
</P>
<P>
   At Tampa, Fla., Roger Clemens allowed five runs in six innings
and Derek Jeter hit his fourth homer of the spring. The Yankees
also said that Orlando Hernandez will start opening day on April 3
at Anaheim.
</P>
<P>
Rangers 5, Pirates 5, 11 innings
</P>
<P>
   At Bradenton, Fla., Wil Cordero hit a three-run home run one day
after not showing up for a road game. Cordero returned to the
lineup after unexpectedly missing Friday's game against the Atlanta
Braves. He met Saturday with manager Gene Lamont, who said
afterward the situation was resolved.
</P>
<P>
Dodgers 2, Orioles (ss) 1
</P>
<P>
   At Fort Lauderdale, Fla., Orel Hershiser pitched no-hit ball for
five innings and Dave Hansen doubled in the tiebreaking run in the
ninth.
</P>
<P>
Twins 6, Blue Jays 4
</P>
<P>
   At Dunedin, Fla., Eric Milton struck out 10 batters in six
innings, including Raul Mondesi three times. Mondesi was ejected in
the sixth for arguing a called third strike.
</P>
<P>
Reds 9, Devil Rays 6
</P>
<P>
   At St. Petersburg, Fla., Dmitri Young hit a two-run homer and
finished with four RBIs, while Dante Bichette went 3-for-4 with a
two-run homer off Ryan Rupe.
</P>
<P>
Orioles 5, Cardinals 3
</P>
<P>
   At Jupiter, Fla., Jim Edmonds went 1-for-3 with an RBI single in
his first game for St. Louis. Ryan Minor, who played third for
Baltimore in place of Cal Ripken, had three hits for the Orioles.
</P>
<P>
Astros 2, Expos 1
</P>
<P>
   At Kissimmee, Fla., Dwight Gooden pitched three scoreless
innings and Lance Berkman drove in the winning run with a single in
the eighth inning.
</P>
<P>
Padres 11, Mariners 7
</P>
<P>
   At Peoria, Ariz., Al Martin shrugged off the controversy
surrounding him and went 2-for-4 with a homer. Since returning from
his arrest in a bizarre domestic violence case, Martin is 5-for-10
with a double, homer and a stolen base.
</P>
<P>
Angels 10, Giants 0
</P>
<P>
   At Scottsdale, Ariz., Adam Kennedy made a good impression in his

</P>
<P>

<P>
   EDMONTON, Alberta (AP) -- Markus Naslund scored the game-winner
late in the third period Saturday night, leading the Vancouver
Canucks to a 3-2 victory over the Edmonton Oilers.
</P>
<P>
   Minutes after Edmonton's Ethan Moreau tied it, Naslund took a
perfect feed from Ed Jovanovski and beat a helpless Tommy Salo at
14:24.
</P>
<P>
   Todd Bertuzzi and Harold Druken each had a goal and an assist
for the Canucks, who are only one point out of the final playoff
spot in the Western Conference. Vancouver, with 78 points, trails
eighth-place Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   Doug Weight opened the scoring at 3:48 of the first when he
lifted a rebound past Felix Potvin.
</P>
<P>
   Druken tied it in the first minute of the second, beating Salo
during a power play. It was Druken's sixth goal and first on the
power play.
</P>
<P>
   Bertuzzi made it 2-1 with his 23rd goal, scored at 4:21 of the
third, after he parked himself in front of the Edmonton net and
banged the puck past Salo. Moreau tied it at 10:43.
</P>
<P>
   Potvin continued his stellar play, stopping 26 shots, including
12 in the third period.
</P>
<P>
   The Canucks have five wins in six games (5-1-0) and have scored
29 times.
</P>
<P>
   Edmonton is in sixth place in the West with 80 points, two
behind Northwest Division-leading Colorado.

<HEADLINE> Royals Release Paul Sorrento  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   HAINES CITY, Fla. (AP) -- The Kansas City Royals released first
baseman Paul Sorrento on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Sorrento, 35, signed a minor league contract with the Royals on
Jan. 26 and expected to be Mike Sweeney's backup at first base. But
Kansas City purchased Dave McCarty from the Oakland Athletics on
Friday, making Sorrento expendable.
</P>
<P>
   Sorrento, with Tampa Bay last season, was in camp as a
non-roster player and hit .286 (12-for-42) with one homer and 11
RBIs in 17 spring training games, with two errors.
</P>
<P>
   General manager Herk Robinson said the team needed sharper
defense than Sorrento provided.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think we have to do better than that. I think there are some
abilities he lacks,'' Robinson said. ''He's a good person, a
veteran who has been around and been on some winning clubs, but
when you look at late-inning replacements and things of that
nature, we have to do better.''
</P>
<P>
   Sorrento left the clubhouse immediately after being told of his
release.
</P>
<P>
   Sorrento hit .235 with 11 homers and 42 RBIs in 99 games last
season. His best season was in 1996, when he hit a career-high .289
with 23 homers and a career-high 93 RBIs for Seattle.

was unlikely to produce an immediate resumption of Syrian-Israeli negotiations,
which broke off in January. Instead, he said, the hope is that the two sides
''over the next few weeks will reach the conclusion that they can enter into a

<TEXT>
<P>
   PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) -- Usha Gilmore scored 18 points and Rutgers
pulled away in the final seven minutes to beat Alabama-Birmingham
60-45 Saturday night in the West Regional semifinals.
</P>
<P>
   Tasha Pointer added 11 points and nine assists as the No.
2-seeded Scarlet Knights (24-7) advanced to the round of eight for
the second straight year and fourth time in school history.
</P>
<P>
   Rutgers will play Georgia, an 83-57 winner over North Carolina,
on Monday for a spot in the Final Four. Rutgers has never advanced
that far; Georgia has been five times.
</P>
<P>
   Deanna Jackson scored 17 points for 11th-seeded UAB (21-13), but
she and the rest of the Lady Blazers couldn't hit their shots after
pulling to within 44-43 with 7:18 to play.
</P>
<P>
   A layup by Davalyn Cunningham started a 16-2 run to end the
game. Three straight baskets by Shawnetta Stewart pushed the lead
to 52-45 with 4:11 remaining. A baseline jumper by Gilmore, a bank
shot by Karlita Washington and another jumper by Gilmore made it
58-45 with 45.8 seconds left.
</P>
<P>
   UAB got this far by upsetting No. 6 seed Oregon and then No. 3
seed Mississippi State. The Blazers had lost their only tournament
game before this season, in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   The Blazers looked overmatched from the start Saturday, trailing
8-0 on 3-pointers by Pointer and Stewart, and Rutgers peppered UAB
with shorter jumpers the rest of the half.
</P>
<P>
   After trailing by as many as 11, UAB pulled to 30-23 on a strong
inside move by Michelle Smith and two free throws by Lisa Jackson,
Deanna's older sister. The Blazers got a rebound in the final
seconds, but Pointer stole it and scored just before the buzzer to
give the Knights a 32-23 halftime lead.
</P>
<P>
   Rutgers led by eight with 8:24 left before the Blazers ran off
seven straight points, on a layup and 3-pointer by Deanna Jackson
and two free throws by Brandi Stallings.
</P>
<P>
   Deanna Jackson had totaled 52 points in the first two games but
mostly was held in check by Rutgers, and her sister was unable to
post up against the more athletic Scarlet Knights.
</P>
<P>
   Rutgers has held 15 opponents under 50 points this season. Its
only loss in the last nine games was to top-ranked Connecticut.

<HEADLINE> NCAA Women's Tournament Roundup  </HEADLINE>
By CHUCK SCHOFFNER, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   Tennessee again dominated Virginia in the NCAA women's
basketball tournament. Connecticut was just plain dominating.
</P>
<P>
   As the tournament field went from 16 to eight on a long day of
regional semifinals Saturday, the two favorites showed no signs of
slowing down.
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee, the No. 1 seed in the Mideast Regional, forced a
flurry of early turnovers in beating fourth-seeded Virginia 77-56
to move to within one game of its fifth Final Four in six years.
</P>
<P>
   ''The first five minutes were like a nightmare,'' said Virginia
coach Debbie Ryan, whose team committed 10 turnovers while falling
behind 15-2. ''I think our team learned a lesson today about
playing at this level.''
</P>
<P>
   Connecticut, the top seed in the East, rolled over fifth-seeded
Oklahoma 102-80 to stay on track for its fourth Final Four
appearance. The Huskies swarmed all over the Big 12 tri-champions
on defense, making 21 steals and forcing 33 turnovers.
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee (31-3) will play third-seeded Texas Tech (28-4) in the
regional final Monday night. Texas Tech overcame a 17-0 deficit to
beat second-seeded Notre Dame 69-65.
</P>
<P>
   Third-seeded LSU (25-6) stands between Connecticut (33-1) and a
trip to Philadelphia for the national semifinals. LSU came up with
a big second half to beat second-seeded Duke 79-66.
</P>
<P>
   In the Midwest Regional, Louisiana Tech extended coach Leon
Barmore's career by one more game, beating Old Dominion 86-74. Tech
will face Penn State, which beat Iowa State 66-65.
</P>
<P>
   And in the West, Georgia steamrolled North Carolina 83-57, while
Rutgers defeated Alabama-Birmingham 60-45.
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee ran its record against Virginia to 10-1, with seven of
those victories coming in March. Now the Lady Vols will play in the
round that has haunted them for a year.
</P>
<P>
   They lost to Duke in the East Regional final last year, denying
them a chance to win a fourth straight national championship.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've tried for a year to be playing on Monday night to get to
a Final Four,'' Tennessee coach Pat Summitt said. ''The freshmen
may not understand how much we wanted to be in that game. We don't
care who we play. We just want to bring our game.''
</P>
<P>
   Connecticut has won its three NCAA games by an average of 44
points. But after losing to Iowa State in the third round last
year, the No. 1-ranked Huskies are taking nothing for granted.
</P>
<P>
   ''Everything is one step at a time,'' junior Shea Ralph said.
''If we don't win this game, then we go home and we don't have
three more to go. We're going to enjoy this tonight and then we're
going to get back down to business tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
EAST
Connecticut 102, Oklahoma 80
</P>
<P>
   Connecticut displayed its usual balance and took control with an
early 18-0 run. Ashja Jones and Tamika Williams led the Huskies
with 16 points each and Svetlana Abrosimova scored 15.
</P>
<P>
   In reaching 100 points for the second time in NCAA play and the
ninth time this season, UConn hit 18 of its first 25 shots and
finished 40-for-70 (57 percent).
</P>
<P>
   Phylesha Whaley had 24 points and Laneishea Caufield 22 for
Oklahoma (25-8), which set a school record for victories three
years after going 5-22.
</P>
<P>
LSU 79, Duke 66
</P>
<P>
   Marie Ferdinand scored 15 of her 22 points in the second half
and sparked a 12-0 run that put the Lady Tigers ahead to stay with
about 13 minutes left. Sharp passing was critical for LSU, which
had assists on 22 of its 30 baskets.
</P>
<P>
   DeTrina White added 19 points and 11 rebounds for LSU and April
Brown had 16 points. In its three tournament games, LSU has
outscored its opponents by 57 points in the second half. They've
been outscored by nine in the first half of those games.
</P>
<P>
   Duke (28-6), the national runner-up last year, was led by Lauren
Rice's 17 points.
</P>

MIDEAST
Tennessee 77, Virginia 56
</P>
<P>
   Virginia (25-9) recovered from its horrible start and trailed
just 45-42 after Lisa Hosac's 3-pointer capped an 11-0 run. But the
Lady Vols responded with a 20-3 run to put it out of reach, much to
the delight of the pro-Tennessee crowd at The Pyramid in Memphis.
</P>
<P>
   All-American Tamika Catchings led Tennessee with 28 points and
Semeka Randall added 19. Svetlana Volnaya scored 18 for Virginia.
</P>
<P>
Texas Tech 69, Notre Dame 65
</P>
<P>
   Texas Tech got off to an even worse start than Virginia, yet
still found a way to get past the Irish (27-5).
</P>
<P>
   The Lady Raiders chipped away at the lead with outside jumpers
and went ahead to stay after Notre Dame's 6-foot-5 Ruth Riley went
to the bench with her fourth foul and the game tied at 50.
</P>
<P>
   Aleah Johnson has 18 points for Texas Tech, which did not score
until Plenette Pierson's breakaway layup with 13:06 left in the
first half. Riley scored 19 before fouling out. She had nine in her
team's opening run.
MIDWEST
La. Tech 86, Old Dominion 74
</P>
<P>
   Betty Lennox, undaunted after misfiring on nine of her first 10
shots, scored 25 points as Louisiana Tech (31-2) extended Barmore's
coaching career. The 18-year coach said he'll retire after this
season. Tech is seeking its third straight Final Four appearance
and the 10th under Barmore.
</P>
<P>
   Old Dominion pulled to 52-46 on Lucienne Berthieu's layup with
14:43 left, but Catrina Frierson scored on a follow shot and Lennox
on a 3-pointer for a 57-46 lead. After two straight Old Dominion
baskets, Tech's Christie Sides made a 3 from the left wing and
Lennox, who had left the game briefly because of leg cramps,
returned to make another 3.
</P>
<P>
   Tamicha Jackson's 3-pointer made it 66-50 and Lennox answered
Sharron Francis' 3-pointer with one of her own, putting Tech ahead
69-53 with 10:14 to go.
Penn State 66, Iowa St. 65
</P>
<P>
   Helen Darling scored the winning basket with 12.6 seconds left
and finished with 21 points to lift Penn State (29-4) within a game
of its first Final Four trip.
</P>
<P>
   Iowa State (27-6) led 65-64 after Angie Welle sank two free
throws with 27.8 seconds left. Penn State's Andrea Garner then
missed a jump shot from the left baseline and Megan Taylor seemed
to have the rebound for Iowa State. But Darling stripped the ball
from Taylor and bounced in a shot off the front rim.
</P>
<P>
   Garner, Penn State's shortest starter at 5-feet-7, also had 11
rebounds, six assists and three steals. Maren Walseth added 14
points for the Lady Lions.

Georgia 83, North Carolina 57
</P>
<P>
   Tawana McDonald had 18 points, Coco Miller 17 and Shala Crawford
16 as top-seeded Georgia (32-3) used a punishing inside game to
move within one games of its fourth Final Four appearance in six
years.
</P>
<P>
   Juana Brown had 19 points and Jackie Higgins 14 for the
fifth-seeded Tar Heels (20-13), who had won eight of nine.

</P>
<P>
   Georgia led by 13 at halftime and needed less than six minutes
of the second half to push it to 20. Coco Miller hit a 3-pointer
and a jumper, twin sister Kelly Miller hit two jumpers and McDonald
sank four free throws to make it 56-35 with 14:07 left.
Rutgers 60, Alabama-Birmingham 45
</P>
<P>
   Usha Gilmore scored 18 points and Tasha Pointer added 11 points
and nine assists as second-seeded Rutgers (24-7) pulled away in the
final seven minutes to advance to the round of eight for the second

<HEADLINE> Blueberry may enjoy fruits of national promotion effort  </HEADLINE>
By LAURENCE ARNOLD, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The watermelon has one. Peanuts do too. Even
the mushroom, a fungus no matter how you slice it, has a national
research and promotion board dedicated to its economic well-being.
</P>
<P>
   Now the blueberry may gain a national advocate of its own.
</P>
<P>
   About 2,200 blueberry producers and importers were eligible to
vote this month in a referendum on whether to create a new,
industry-funded U.S.A. Blueberry Council. Ballots were due Friday
to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, which will announce the
results within a few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Support for the measure is broad in the two leading
blueberry-producing states, Michigan and New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   The New Jersey Blueberry Industry Advisory Council endorses
creation of the board, as does the Michigan Blueberry Growers
Association, a cooperative representing more than 450 owners in
Michigan as well as Indiana, Georgia and Florida.
</P>
<P>
   ''We feel there's a whole world out there that may not know the
blueberry story, the health benefits of blueberries,'' said Art
Galletta, a co-owner of Atlantic Blueberry Company in Hammonton,
N.J.
</P>
<P>
   He cited recent research indicating that eating blueberries may
improve short-term memory, restore coordination and fight a variety
of health problems including heart disease and cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Many blueberry producers already pay voluntary dues to a
promotional group, the North American Blueberry Council. The
national council, if approved, would charge mandatory assessments
to all domestic producers as well as foreign producers who ship
blueberries to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The North American Blueberry Council initiated the referendum
process. Its executive director, Mark Villata, said the entire
industry needs to join in the effort to expand the blueberry
market.
</P>
<P>
   ''The bottom line is, there are more and more blueberries to
sell, and we have to find markets for those blueberries,'' Villata
said.
</P>
<P>
   Voluntary dues to the North American Blueberry council are now
$9 a ton. If approved, mandatory dues to the U.S. Blueberry Council
would be $12 a ton. For a big owner like Galletta, that would mean
$60,000 a year in dues.
</P>
<P>
   And New Jersey producers already pay $12 a ton to the state
blueberry advisory council, which was formed in 1989 to fund
blueberry promotional efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Tim Wetherbee, chairman of the state advisory council, said the
money is well spent.
</P>
<P>
   ''I just think it's time everybody comes aboard and tries to
support their livelihood,'' said Wetherbee, sales manager at
Diamond Blueberry Incorporated in Hammonton.
</P>
<P>
   The new council would collect some $1.1 million a year. Its
mission, according to the agriculture department, would be to
''develop and finance an effective and coordinated program of
promotion, research and information to maintain and expand the
markets for cultivated blueberries.''
</P>
<P>
   The council's 13 members would be selected from blueberry
producers, importers, exporters and handlers.
</P>
<P>
   The blueberry is one of only three native North American fruits,
the others being the Concord grape and the cranberry. North America
is the world's leading producer of blueberries.
</P>
<P>
   The new national council would promote only highbush or
''cultivated'' blueberries, which are often sold fresh and which
account for about 70 percent of blueberries produced in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey last year trailed only Michigan in the production of
cultivated blueberries. Some 36 million pounds were harvested,
worth just over $28 million, according to the New Jersey Department
of Agriculture.
</P>
<P>
   Lowbush or ''wild'' blueberries are produced primarily in Maine
and eastern Canada and are often sold frozen or in baked goods.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to watermelons, peanuts and mushrooms, the federal
Department of Agriculture currently oversees research and promotion
programs for honey, popcorn, potatoes, beef, pork, soybeans, dairy,
fluid milk, cotton and eggs. A program for olive oil is under
consideration.
</P>
<P>
   But not all efforts succeed. Lime producers voted down a program
in 1995, and the flower and potted plant industry did the same in
1997. Pecan producers voted in 1994 to end a program after three
years.

<HEADLINE> Smokers May Get Hurt More Often  </HEADLINE>
By IRA DREYFUSS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Add blisters, bruises, sprains and even broken
bones to the list of things that smokers are more likely to get.
</P>
<P>
   A study of Army basic trainees finds that those who were smokers
before entering basic training had a 1.5 times higher rate of
injuries related to exercise.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our findings make smoking a greater immediate concern to
commanders because smoking can affect injury risk and thereby the
readiness of soldiers,'' the researchers said. ''Additionally,
results should be of interest to the civilian community, because
they suggest that youthful smokers will have an immediate reason
not to start smoking, or to quit.''
</P>
<P>
   In the study, reported in the April issue of a supplement to the
American Journal of Preventive Medicine, researchers followed 1,087
men and 915 women through all eight weeks of basic training.
</P>
<P>
   The recruits were asked, before they started training, about
their smoking habits. And the scientists kept track of the new
soldiers' clinic visits during training.
</P>
<P>
   Recruits who said they had been smokers had significantly higher
risks of injuries, the study found. Forty percent of men who had
smoked reported an injury, compared with 29 percent of nonsmokers.
Among women, 56 percent of the smoking group reported an injury,
compared with 46 percent of nonsmokers.
</P>
<P>
   The study accounted statistically for things that could make the
smokers' injury risk appear higher. One such factor is the smokers'
lower levels of fitness at the start of training. Other studies
have shown that smokers have less endurance than do nonsmokers.
Injury rates are higher among people who are less fit, because they
get worn out sooner.
</P>
<P>
   And the study indicates that giving up smoking is no quick fix
to the injury problem, said Dr. John W. Gardner, an Army colonel
and researcher at the Uniformed Services University of the Health
Sciences, Bethesda, Md.
</P>
<P>
   Basic training is smoke-free, and recruits are monitored, so
it's not easy to sneak a cigarette during training. As a result,
the higher injury risk lingered for weeks, even after the smokers
had been forced to quit, Gardner said.
</P>
<P>
   The study should give young smokers more reason not to smoke,
Gardner said. Trainee-age young adults may not be able to look far
enough into the future to imagine themselves developing heart
disease or lung cancer in middle age, but they can understand a
stress fracture right now, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Other studies have found that smoking reduces the fitness gained
from exercise. For instance, research on British officer trainees
found smokers trailed nonsmokers in fitness improvements, even when
smokers and nonsmokers started at equal fitness levels.
</P>
<P>
   The findings on U.S. basic trainees fit a pattern of research
that indicates smoking raises the risks of injury, said Bruce N.
Leistikow of the University of California, Davis.
</P>
<P>
   Leistikow had found American smokers in general faced a 1.8
percent higher risk of death from injury. He tracked deaths from
1990 to 1995 among people who had answered questions for the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's National Health
Interview Survey.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers don't know why smokers would face a greater risk of
injury, but they have some ideas.
</P>
<P>
   Smokers tend to have impairments in such things as the knee jerk
reflex, so smoking seems to affect coordination, Leistikow said.
''If reflexes and coordination are impaired, then people are at a
higher risk of injury,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Smoking also may impair the body's ability to heal, Gardner
said. Exercise is supposed to create microtraumas -- small amounts
of damage to tissue that prompt the body to respond by making the
healed tissue stronger than it had been before the injury. But
recovery from exercise takes time, and smoking may delay recovery,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Smoking has many different effects, but nicotine is simply
poisonous,'' Leistikow said. ''If people are partially poisoned, it
lessens their ability to avoid injuries and recover from
injuries.''
</P>
<P>
   Another expert thinks the carbon monoxide of smoke may be a big
factor, by depriving cells of oxygen. ''We are starving our
tissues,'' said Dr. Paul J. Amoroso, a lieutenant colonel at the
U.S. Army Research Institute of Environmental Medicine, Natick,
Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Amoroso's advice to smokers who are starting exercise is to go
easier than nonsmokers on repetitive, impact-creating activities
such as running. However, research can't tell yet how much less
they should do, on what specific activities, or how long it might
take for the higher risk to diminish, he said.

<HEADLINE> Plant May Help Wastewater Treatment  </HEADLINE>
By GARY D. ROBERTSON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SNOW HILL, N.C. (AP) -- Paul Skillicorn spreads the root and tiny
green leaves of one of the world's smallest flowering plants, which
he thinks may be the answer to problem hog lagoons and aging
wastewater treatment systems.
</P>
<P>
   ''This duckweed is a living mat for organisms,'' Skillicorn said
as an inchworm wiggled in his hand through fronds the size of a
needle's eye.
</P>
<P>
   Skillicorn, who spent nearly a decade teaching Third World
communities how to harvest duckweed for a profit, says the plants
absorb pollution-causing nutrients from waste. The plants then can
be harvested, dried and made into pellets for animal feed.
</P>
<P>
   The swine industry has shown lukewarm interest so far in
Skillicorn's ideas, although he has a makeshift duckweed system at
one hog farm in Greene County, about 60 miles east of Raleigh. But
the Greene County town of Hookerton, faced with a $2 million price
tag to pipe its waste 10 miles to Snow Hill, wants to test it.
</P>
<P>
   While obstacles remain, a $790,000 state grant is waiting for
Hookerton to become the first municipality in North Carolina -- and
only a few dozen nationwide -- to become reliant on a duckweed
system.
</P>
<P>
   Skillicorn says the future of small towns can hinge on
wastewater capacity. Without room for expansion, development won't
happen.
</P>
<P>
   ''Everybody treats it as nothing,'' Skillicorn said. ''But they
don't think it through of just how profound wastewater capacity
is.''
</P>
<P>
   Laurel, Del., a town of 3,800, added a duckweed finishing pond
to its three-lagoon system because of a high algae concentration.
Pollution levels are down, and the duckweed is harvested and made
available to all residents as compost.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's done a pretty good job, although it's been a little more
work than what we thought at times,'' said Al Adkins, Laurel's
public works supervisor.
</P>
<P>
   Hookerton's three-lagoon system, similar to Laurel's, becomes
less efficient in killing algae and bacteria when lagoons grow
warmer in the summer, and it has paid the price.
</P>
<P>
   The town was fined $3,689 by the state for violating pollution
limits at Contentnea Creek in the early 1990s and $3,000 last year,
according to state regulators. Since January 1999, it has been
operating under a special monitoring pact with the state.
</P>
<P>
   ''The system is outdated, so it's been a worry,'' Hookerton
board member Ken Garris said.
</P>
<P>
   Then Hookerton officials heard about Skillicorn, who moved here
in 1998 after setting up duckweed-based wastewater treatment
systems in Bangladesh and Peru for a decade through a nonprofit
organization. He hopes to make a living with his firm, The Duckweed
Co.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was looking for a place with intensive animal operations, so
I thought, 'Why not come to North Carolina?''' said Skillicorn, an
Australia native who is now an American citizen.
</P>
<P>
   Skillicorn recommended that Hookerton install 26 greenhouses,
each 100-feet-by-15 feet. Untreated waste from the first lagoon
would enter the greenhouses, where duckweed would feed off
nutrients in the waste, growing rapidly. Nutrients dumped into
rivers and streams generate algae blooms that rob waters of oxygen,
hurting plant and animal life. But under Skillicorn's plan,
duckweed would break down the nutrients while removing those
pollutants from the water.
</P>
<P>
   Workers would harvest duckweed daily and take it to a farm to
dry out, in the process killing any pathogens that remain. The
resulting olive-green material would be sold to feed operators for
livestock.
</P>
<P>
   ''What we've got is the same kind of protein levels as the
soybean has,'' Skillicorn said as he handled some dried duckweed on
a 2,000-head hog farm in Snow Hill, where he set up a greenhouse to
treat hog waste.
</P>
<P>
   He said the duckweed system would reduce nitrogen levels in the
raw waste Hookerton discharges into Contentnea Creek -- from 3.6
pounds per day to 1 pound. The amount of fecal coliform would be
cut by 75 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, the town's two other lagoons would be eliminated,
because expanding a duckweed system's capacity is easy: Add more
greenhouses. Skillicorn said Hookerton could expand from its
current discharge limit of 60,000 gallons per day to 200,000
gallons with the duckweed system.
</P>
<P>
   Administrative costs would be about $30,000 a year, and the
capital cost would be a third the cost of piping Hookerton's waste
to Snow Hill, Skillicorn said. ''We're making more promises than
any other plan in the state and in the world,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Skillicorn said duckweed could become an option for dozens of
North Carolina towns with aging treatment systems that violate
state pollution controls. Many face tough financial times should
they hook up to a larger system.
</P>
<P>
   Encouraged by state environmental secretary Bill Holman, the
state Clean Water Management Trust Fund agreed in November to give
Hookerton and its 515 residents a $790,000 grant for the duckweed
system. Some red tape must be negotiated before Hookerton gets the
money, but amid concern there is hope.
</P>
<P>
   ''There was very favorable reception to the project,'' said
David McNaught, the outgoing executive director of the trust fund.
</P>
<P>
   Some state regulators are skeptical of duckweed's effectiveness.
A state Division of Water Quality official who reviewed the project
for the trust fund said duckweed would ''offer little, if any,
improvement'' over simply installing additional filters.
</P>
<P>
   However, Holman said duckweed might be Hookerton's best option,
given the high cost of tying into a regional system.
</P>
<P>
   Water quality spokesman Ernie Seneca said the division prefers
regional systems because they are easier to monitor, and with
duckweed, ''you're talking about an innovative technology system.''
</P>
<P>
   Hookerton leaders said piping waste to a regional system would
limit Hookerton's wastewater capacity, stifling any growth it might
realize from the Global TransPark, a projected air and industrial
park in nearby Kinston. Mayor Kim Purser says if the town cannot
offer new industry sewer and water, it has nothing to offer.

</P>
<P>
   Duckweed refers to species of free-floating, stemless aquatic
plants touted for their uses in waste treatment, animal feed and
pharmaceuticals.
</P>
<P>
   Known by botanists under the family of Lemnaceae, duckweed is
believed to be both the world's smallest-flowering and
fastest-growing plant.
</P>
<P>
   It grows 20 times faster than corn, doubling in size within a
few days through a natural cloning method. It can tangle the lines
of recreational fishermen casting near duckweed along still,
freshwater areas where the plants thrive.
</P>
<P>
   North Carolina is a common habitat for duckweed, whose fronds
range in size from a pin head (genus Wolffia) to under a centimeter
in length (Lemna and Spirodela). Wolffia species do not have roots,
while Lemna and Spirodela have one or a few roots that dangle in
the water.
</P>
<P>
   Duckweed can be used to cleanse wastewater, reducing nitrogen
and phosphorous in human waste.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Skillicorn, who is attempting to set up a wastewater
treatment system in the town of Hookerton, N.C., and other
researchers also believe it could clean up hog waste, making
lagoons unnecessary.
</P>
<P>
   Duckweed produces more protein on average than soybeans. It can
also be used to feed exotic fish being raised for aquaculture.
</P>
<P>
   North Carolina State University researcher Anne-Marie Stomp has
been working to genetically engineer duckweed to produce proteins
such as insulin more cheaply and in greater quantities than through
traditional methods. Stomp applied for a patent for her procedure
and began Biolex Inc., a plant biotechnology company.
</P>
<P>
   As patents on the oldest protein drugs expire, duckweed could
become ''the premier protein production system of the 21st
century,'' Stomp said.
</P>
<P>
   She said duckweed clones itself naturally, creating an identical
copy of its parent, and its high protein content and rapid growth
could be used in a controlled environment.

<HEADLINE> Navajos Move Toward Solar Power  </HEADLINE>
By MICHELLE RUSHLO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   DILKON, Ariz. (AP) -- On the breezy grass plains where
generations of Joanne Jackson's family have been born and raised, a
wood bungalow with faded tan paint is alive with electricity.
</P>
<P>
   The three-room house was built years ago in this western part of
the Navajo Nation using her husband's veterans benefits. And though
it had white plastic outlet plates on the walls and lights in the
ceiling, they were merely decorative -- until September.
</P>
<P>
   It was then that Mrs. Jackson, 62, and her husband, Raymond, 82,
became the first inhabitants of the Navajo Nation to get power
through a solar generator program whose founders hope to eventually
deliver power throughout American Indian reservations.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 37,000 occupied structures on the Navajo Reservation,
only 9 percent have electricity and 14 percent have utility gas,
according to 1990 Census Bureau statistics. Most other Navajos cook
and heat with wood, coal or fuel oil.
</P>
<P>
   Large spreads of open land frequently separate the homes on the
reservation, which at 4.8 million acres covers an area slightly
smaller than New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   The rambling expanses make hooking into the power grid
eye-poppingly expensive. Stringing power lines costs roughly
$30,000 per mile, according to Arizona Public Service -- an
impossible sum for most families in this region where the
unemployment rate hovers around 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
   By comparison, a one-kilowatt solar generator, which can provide
for basic needs, costs roughly $10,000.
</P>
<P>
   The solar systems are ideal for Indian reservations because they
are less expensive than power lines and don't tear up the
landscape, said Gregory Kiss, president of Native American
Photovoltaics, the non-profit corporation that helped install the
Jacksons' system.
</P>
<P>
   NAPV, launched last June with a $220,000 federal grant, started
a lease-to-own program in the southwestern portion of the
reservation, offering families one-kilowatt systems. The solar
generators provide enough power to fuel a refrigerator, lights,
television, water pump and computer for an average family of four.
</P>
<P>
   It costs the Jacksons nothing to own the generator -- it was
installed so they can show others how it works -- but normally a
one-kilowatt system would cost $50 per month through the program. A
family would agree to a three-year lease and, if they choose to buy
it at that time, the money paid toward the lease would be applied
to the purchase price.
</P>
<P>
   The program, still in its infancy, should have 20 systems
installed in the next six months, said Kiss, a New York architect
who specializes in integrating solar systems into buildings.
</P>
<P>
   Other government programs and individual homeowners have
installed thousands of solar generators on the reservation over the
years, Kiss said, but many generators do not function today because
they were never maintained.
</P>
<P>
   The maintenance required for the systems is minor. The
solar-charged batteries, which are similar to golf cart batteries,
need water and occasional service, Kiss said. But without that
maintenance, the systems die. In some cases, the Navajo have not
been taught how to maintain the systems.
</P>
<P>
   To combat that and provide some badly needed jobs on the
reservation, NAPV will train unemployed Navajo to service and
maintain the systems periodically. Kiss is hoping to eventually
create a self-sustaining industry.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're trying to make the program behave like a distributed
service,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the Jacksons, who received their generator as a
demonstration system, are thrilled.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Jackson has a refrigerator for the first time, sparing her
trip after trip in an old pickup truck 10 miles down the dusty
rutted road from her home to the market. She keeps a few tomatoes
and soda cans in the small refrigerator, smiling proudly as she
shows it off to visitors.
</P>
<P>
   ''I like the whole system,'' Mrs. Jackson, who speaks primarily
Navajo, said through a translator. ''I have been really wanting a
refrigerator.''
</P>
<P>
   Anna M. Frazier, whose duties in this Navajo community of 2,000
are similar to that of mayor, said many of the roughly 1,200 Dilkon
residents have no power. They use lanterns for light, wood stoves
and propane for heat and cooking.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's just how we've always lived,'' Frazier said. ''To have
electricity, we had to adjust our lifestyle.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet, she and others say electricity does provide convenience and
safety for Navajo families.
</P>
<P>
   At minimum, it means Navajo children can do their homework at
night and maybe one day access a computer, Frazier said.
</P>
<P>
   For Mrs. Jackson, it means her husband can safely descend the
rough wood steps at the front of the house by porch light at night.
It's a minor convenience in an urban area but an enormous help here
-- where the nearest street light is 30 miles away.
</P>
<P>
   ''The porch light is on,'' Mrs. Jackson said. ''That's one thing
I like.''
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   The one-kilowatt solar generators use a series of batteries that
are similar to golf cart batteries.
</P>
<P>
   The 20 batteries sit in metal cases and are connected to thin
silvery sheets that create a shade area roughly large enough to
cover a mid-sized car.
</P>
<P>
   The units can fuel a radio, television, small refrigerator,
water pump, telephone, computer and lights, even on the cloudiest
days. On bright, sunny days, they can generate twice as much energy
as needed to supply all of the appliances.

<HEADLINE> Gore Shadowed by Fund-Raising Probe  </HEADLINE>
By PETE YOST, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Missing e-mail. The Buddhist temple. No
controlling legal authority. These fund-raising images haunt Vice
President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Federal prosecutors and Republicans threaten, for very different
reasons, to extend the impact of the 1996 fund-raising missteps
well into the fall presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department opened an investigation last week into
whether e-mails from Gore's office and other parts of the White
House were hidden from criminal and congressional investigators who
had subpoenaed them.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans, from presidential rival George W. Bush to House
Government Reform Committee Chairman Dan Burton, are keeping the
issue alive with hearings, advertisements and campaign stump
attacks. They are motivated by polling that shows the vice
president is vulnerable on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's sort of a low-grade toothache -- it's not going to kill
you, but it's irritating, and it doesn't go away,'' Brookings
Institution senior fellow Stephen Hess said of the fund-raising
problems.
</P>
<P>
   Gore breathed a sigh of relief two years ago when the Justice
Department concluded there was no reason to name an independent
counsel to investigate him or President Clinton, which essentially
cleared Gore of wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   While he maintains he broke no laws, Gore's discomfort level has
risen in recent weeks since:
</P>
<P>
   --A memo surfaced showing the chief of the Justice Department
prosecution task force angrily disagreed with the decision not to
name an independent prosecutor and accused political appointees at
Justice of engaging in ''contortions'' to avoid naming a special
prosecutor.
</P>
<P>
   --The White House belatedly disclosed thousands of e-mails were
never reviewed to determine if they were responsive to the
fund-raising investigation. Several employees who knew about the
problem said they were threatened if they talked about it. That
gave the fund-raising task force new license to revisit the Gore
issue.
</P>
<P>
   --One of Gore's former friends and political supporters, Maria
Hsia, was convicted of fund-raising illegalities at a trial that
featured video of Gore with Buddhist nuns at a California temple
event that generated $60,000 in illegal donations.
</P>
<P>
   The footage quickly made its way from the courtroom to the vast
Internet, compliments of the Republican National Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Gore long ago apologized for his initial answers to questions
about fund-raising, such as an often-ridiculed response that ''no
controlling legal authority'' prohibited him from making
fund-raising calls from his White House office.
</P>
<P>
   But FBI interview reports show Gore continued to use crafty
answers to sticky questions. In one interview with FBI agents, Gore
suggested he may have missed a key discussion because he drank too
much iced tea and needed a restroom break.
</P>
<P>
   To blunt the criticism, Gore has donned the mantle of campaign
fund-raising reform in hopes of picking up swing voters attracted
to presidential dropouts John McCain and Bill Bradley, both early
champions of lessening the influence of big money in politics.
</P>
<P>
   That strategy too has given fodder to Gore's political enemies.
</P>
<P>
   Bush frequently suggests that Gore must mistake voters for
having ''amnesia'' and borrows one of Gore's famous flubs to
underscore his own bid for the presidency. ''There needs to be
controlling legal authority in the White House,'' Bush says with a
smile.
</P>
<P>
   Cognizant of polls showing his vulnerability, Gore frequently
says he has learned from his mistakes. ''I know it's time to change
a broken system,'' he tells voters. Of the Buddhist temple event,
he says, ''I should have known that it was related to fund raising.
I did not. But the very fact that I was there was a mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   Even as he embraces reform, Gore heads a fund-raising machine
eager to keep pace with Bush's record-setting campaign. Last week
alone, Gore raised $400,000 for his own campaign and $2 million for
the Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   He also has surrounded himself with some of his party's best
fund-raising practitioners: Tony Coelho, the Gore campaign
chairman, and Terry McAuliffe, in charge of raising unregulated
''soft'' money donations from corporations and labor unions.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's contrition is often contrasted with his answers to FBI
agents a few years back.
</P>
<P>
   Gore likely faced a lengthy criminal investigation if some of
the money he was raising in White House phone solicitations was
''hard'' money targeted for specific candidates and limited by law.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president insisted to the FBI that he raised only
''soft'' money for issue ads, which isn't regulated. However, the
Democratic National Committee split some of the donations Gore
raised from his White House office between ''hard'' and ''soft''
money accounts. Gore said he never knew.
</P>
<P>
   A memo from presidential aide Harold Ickes addressed to the vice
president referred to plans to split the donations between ''hard''
and ''soft.'' Gore didn't read the memo, he insisted to the FBI.
</P>
<P>
   ''Vice President Gore stated that he had not seen this
memorandum and that he did not typically read Ickes' memos,'' the
FBI wrote.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president told FBI agents that while ''he had been a
candidate for 16 years,'' the details of donations are ''a science
he did not involve himself in.''
</P>
<P>
   In a second session with the FBI, agents produced a Gore aide's
notes from a meeting the vice president attended. The notes
referred to the split of ''hard'' and ''soft'' money plus a quote
in which Gore appeared to be offering to shoulder a bigger share of
fund-raising calls.
</P>
<P>
   Gore insisted to the FBI that he ''did not recall anyone saying,
or any discussion regarding'' the split of ''hard'' and ''soft''
money. Pressed for an explanation, Gore said ''it was not uncommon
for him, and for that matter the president, to excuse themselves
from meetings to use the restroom.''
</P>
<P>
   However, the FBI said Gore ''could not recall any of the above
described scenarios ... occurring during this meeting. He also
could not recall anyone else leaving the meeting or having their
attention diverted for any reason.''
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General Janet Reno concluded, ''The evidence fails to
provide any reasonable basis for a conclusion that the vice
president may have lied'' about his solicitations, ending the
investigation.

<HEADLINE> Young Congressman's Ambitious Plan  </HEADLINE>
By NANCY ZUCKERBROD, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- It was Friday night, and young professionals
packed a popular nightclub, cutting loose after a hectic week. One
man, dancing among friends, stood out, partly because he wore a
suit and tie.
</P>
<P>
   He also drew stares because he is a congressman.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, most lawmakers in Washington do not take to the
dance floor outside black-tie charity balls. But Harold Ford Jr. is
not a typical congressman.
</P>
<P>
   At 29, the Memphis Democrat is into his second term as the
youngest member of Congress. He succeeded his father, Harold Ford
Sr., who spent 22 years here as Tennessee's first black
congressman.
</P>
<P>
   Already, the younger Ford, a University of Michigan law
graduate, has his eyes set on becoming Tennessee's first black
governor or U.S. senator. ''I hope to one day have the chance to
serve the entire state,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   That could be challenging in a state that has lately put
Republicans in the Senate and the governor's mansion. Ford
crisscrossed the state before deciding last month not to oppose
incumbent Republican Sen. Bill Frist, and instead seek re-election
to a third term.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was an $8 million to $10 million proposition,'' Ford said,
aware that Frist, a heart surgeon by training, had a campaign chest
of $4.3 million by the end of 1999, compared with the $82,000 in
his own campaign account.
</P>
<P>
   But Ford maintains that his exploration of taking on Frist was
real.
</P>
<P>
   Ford is not as liberal as his father and most members of the
Congressional Black Caucus. He is a member of the centrist New
Democrat Coalition and, more recently, the conservative Blue Dog
Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   ''I served with his father,'' said Rep. Chaka Fattah, D-Pa.
''Harold's focus is a lot different.''
</P>
<P>
   Fattah, a three-term congressman, said he and the younger Ford,
both members of the House Education and the Workforce Committee,
are the only Black Caucus members who favor national standardized
testing in schools.
</P>
<P>
   Ford also supported a constitutional amendment to ban
flag-burning and the 1997 balanced budget agreement that
effectively capped spending on many social programs.
</P>
<P>
   He also has not shied away from criticizing other Democrats. In
1998 he was ruled out of order on the House floor for saying
President Clinton ''lied'' about his affair with Monica Lewinsky.

<HEADLINE> November Key for House Minorities  </HEADLINE>
By PAUL SHEPARD, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- For New York Rep. Major Owens, D-N.Y., the
terminology of war does not overstate the alarm, dismay and dread
that black lawmakers felt when Republicans took control of the
House almost six years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ''We were shellshocked, simply shellshocked,'' Owens said. ''We
had a number of good people poised for leadership positions, but
when we lost the House, it was over. We just lost it all.''
</P>
<P>
   As loyal liberals in a party that had to inch to the political
center to work with ruling Republicans, black and other minority
House members found themselves without political capital on Capitol
Hill.
</P>
<P>
   That could change if Democrats should win back the House in the
fall election. Few are anticipating the voting more eagerly than
black lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   ''All elections are important for us, but this one will have a
little extra ommph behind it for us in particular,'' said Rep.
Carrie Meek, D-Fla. ''Many parts of our agenda haven't received a
full hearing since 1994, so we have a lot at stake.''
</P>
<P>
   Ronald Walters, a University of Maryland political scientist,
said the 1994 election was particularly tough on minority members,
among the most liberal in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Not only did they find themselves with a lesser voice inside the
Democratic Party, Walters said, but senior black lawmakers on the
cusp of heading committees -- Rep. Charles Rangel of New York,
Michigan's Rep. John Conyers and Missouri's retiring Bill Clay --
had to wait.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Republicans took absolute control and reversed most
legislation favored by minorities,'' Walters said. ''The minority
members of Congress didn't have any power on key committees.
Whatever impact they had was lost.''
</P>
<P>
   Rangel, almost certain to chair the tax-writing Ways and Means
Committee in a Democratic Congress, said the past six years of
reduced clout have taught black lawmakers a need to be more
resourceful to accomplish their goals.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've been forced to be united like never before,'' Rangel
said. ''We've had to support each other and join with groups we
never would have thought to increase our backing.''
</P>
<P>
   As an example, Rangel said he has worked on legislation with the
House's ''Blue Dog'' Democrats, the most conservative members of
the party. Rangel said he even considers himself a member.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have to find things to fold into their agenda,'' Rangel
said. ''Sometimes they need our help, and we do a little
negotiating.''
</P>
<P>
   Owens, in line for a subcommittee chairmanship on the House
Education and the Workforce Committee, agreed that black lawmakers
have had to become more deft in forming coalitions, lobbying and
maintaining cohesion for the sake of their agenda.
</P>
<P>
   ''When we got them to back up on ending affirmative action, when
we got the president to send troops to Haiti, it was because they
felt some pressure from us in the black caucus,'' Owens said.
''There were fewer breakthroughs for us as individuals, but we got
some things done as a team.''
</P>
<P>
   Owens said a Democratic majority in the House would likely bring
an unprecedented measure of political power to minorities if
coalition politics with Asians and Hispanics should take root.
</P>
<P>
   The 36 votes of the black lawmakers, 16 votes in the Hispanic
caucus and other progressive allies in the House would become a
crucial bloc to passing or defeating legislation.
</P>
<P>
   ''It would clearly be a new, more empowered environment for
minority members,'' said Karen Narasaki, executive director of the
National Asian Pacific American Legal Consortium.
</P>
<P>
   Lisa Navarrete of the National Council of La Raza, a Latino
advocacy organization, agreed: ''It would be significant because we
have so many members positioned for leadership.'' The most visible
is Nydia Velazquez, D-N.Y., in line to lead the House's Small
Business Committee.
</P>
<P>
   However, agendas of the major minority groups do not always
coincide. Immigration, for example, traditionally has been of
greater import to Asian and Hispanic members than to blacks.
</P>
<P>
   But Narasaki said the common points outweigh the differences,
and the prospect of coalition-building is great.

<HEADLINE> Romanian Debuts in 'La Boheme'  </HEADLINE>
By MIKE SILVERMAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- ''Cats'' may be closing, but New York has an
even longer-running spectacle that still plays to full houses --
Franco Zeffirelli's eye-popping production of Puccini's ''La
Boheme,'' now nearing its 20th anniversary at the Metropolitan
Opera.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, this opera has served to introduce some talented
singers who have gone on to important careers at the Met -- soprano
Veronica Villarroel and tenor Roberto Alagna, to name just two.
</P>
<P>
   At Friday night's season premiere, the spotlight was on Leontina
Vaduva, a Romanian soprano who has sung the part of the consumptive
seamstress Mimi in London and San Francisco -- and has recorded the
opera with Alagna.
</P>
<P>
   Vaduva threw herself into the role emotionally, to such an
extent that she appeared shaken and distraught at her final curtain
call immediately after Mimi's death. In contrast, she was all
flirtatious smiles after the upbeat, romantic conclusion to Act 1.
</P>
<P>
   Her involvement made for a touching portrayal, though some vocal
weaknesses kept her from being a thoroughly winning Mimi. Her voice
tended to wobble under pressure in the upper register, and at times
she was unable to project well across the reaches of Zeffirelli's
vast stage settings. She also fell victim, as did the other
singers, to coordination problems with conductor Marco Armiliato
and the orchestra, possibly resulting from inadequate rehearsal
time.
</P>
<P>
   As her lover, the poet Rodolfo, the veteran tenor Luis Lima
managed some ringing high notes and some graceful phrasing
elsewhere, but often his voice sounded frayed and effortful.
</P>
<P>
   The supporting singers fared better. Soprano Ainhoa Arteta lit
up the stage as Musetta, both with her charismatic enthusiasm and
her penetrating but never strident voice. Simon Keenlyside may lack
the vocal heft for a few of Puccini's orchestral climaxes, but for
the most part his warm, mellow baritone and sympathetic bearing
make him an ideal Marcello.
</P>
<P>
   As for those Zeffirelli sets, they continue to draw almost as
much applause as the singers, but they are looking a bit faded, and
the overcrowded stage business in the split-level Act 2 Cafe Momus
scene has gotten ragged.

<HEADLINE> Black Colleges To Reunite in Fla.  </HEADLINE>
By MIKE SCHNEIDER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- Tens of thousands of black college
students are expected to descend on this oceanside community
starting Friday, and event organizers are hoping they'll find more
than just another bumper-to-bumper party in the streets.
</P>
<P>
   The annual Black College Reunion has been marred in recent years
by charges of discrimination, violence and threats to shut the
round-the-clock streets parties down.
</P>
<P>
   This year, the organizers are trying something new.
</P>
<P>
   They're banking on a tight schedule of concerts -- from gospel to
rap -- pageants, street festivals and volleyball tournaments to
bring order to the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time in its 16-year history, the event has major
corporate sponsors. Adam's Mark hotel, bet.com, Walt Disney World,
Daytona International Speedway and AT&AMP;T Wireless, among others, are
contributing $250,000.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm hoping that Sunday, when this is all over, we can walk
away and say we did our best and overall we had a good event,''
said organizer Dean O'Brien.
</P>
<P>
   Black College Reunion began in 1984 as a loosely organized
series of parties for students and alumni from Bethune-Cookman
College and Florida A&AMP;M University.
</P>
<P>
   The colleges distanced themselves from the event as it evolved
into a rollicking street party, noted more for rowdy behavior than
collegiate camaraderie.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, city commissioners debated putting an end to the event
after a shootout killed an Orlando man and wounded four police
officers.
</P>
<P>
   ''We do get complaints about behavior, which isn't unlike Bike
Week,'' police spokesman Sgt. Al Tolley said, referring to the
annual gathering of thousands of often rowdy motorcycle riders.
''We have similar complaints, but it's different, though. It's not
muffler but stereos and loud music.''
</P>
<P>
   Some studies estimate the three-day Black College Reunion has an
economic impact of almost $35 million. But some black leaders say
it isn't as welcome as other Daytona Beach events -- including Bike
Week and Biketoberfest.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the city tried to restrict traffic to the beach, but
a federal judge ruled the plan unconstitutional because it unfairly
singled out the event.
</P>
<P>
   Black visitors also have complained of an excessive police
presence and unfair treatment by local businesses.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is definitely hostility to Black College Reunion
compared to the other events,'' said Cynthia Slater, first vice
president of the NAACP's Daytona Beach branch.
</P>
<P>
   Five black vacationers last year sued the Adam's Mark, saying
the hotel chain singled them out as security risks and made them --
but not white guests -- wear orange wristbands to get into the
hotel. Black reunion guests also were allegedly charged more than
other special event guests and had to pay cash in full to reserve
rooms.
</P>
<P>
   Adam's Mark last week agreed to pay $8 million, revise policies
and seek minority customers to settle that suit and others filed by
the state and federal government. The company admitted no
wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   Fred Kummer, the company's president and chief executive
officer, plans to be in Daytona Beach during Black College Reunion
to personally manage the hotel.
</P>
<P>
   City officials say they don't treat Black College Reunion any
differently from other events.
</P>
<P>
   ''People are being treated fairly and being given every
opportunity to have a good experience here as long as they obey our
laws and conduct themselves accordingly,'' said Carey Smith,
Daytona Beach's city manager.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton could run, but he could not
hide.
</P>
<P>
   With Clinton a few thousand miles away being presidential in
Europe, even his ever-loyal vice president got in his digs Saturday
night in the 115th renewal of journalism's Gridiron Club roast of
Washington's high and mighty.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, running hard to replace his boss in the White House next
year, delivered the evening's final standup routine, in which he
insisted it is possible to take credit for the administration's
successes without being blamed for its shortcomings.
</P>
<P>
   The trick is in the explanations:
</P>
<P>
   ''A low unemployment rate and a sound economy? Clinton-Gore.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Grand jury testimony? Clinton.''
</P>
<P>
   ''The largest deficit in the nation's history turned into the
largest surplus? Clinton-Gore.''
</P>
<P>
   ''The impeachment? Not me.''
</P>
<P>
   A highlight of the night was the surprise appearance of five
female Cabinet-level officials, wearing Superman outfits, to sing a
parody: ''Thank Heaven For Grown-Up Girls.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Without us, what would Cabinet boys do,'' sang Health and
Human Services Secretary Donna Shalala, Labor Secretary Alexis
Herman, Attorney General Janet Reno, Trade Representative Charlene
Barshefsky and Aida Alvarez, head of the Small Business
Administration.

<HEADLINE> Court To Hear School Prayer Case  </HEADLINE>
By CHRIS FLETCHER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTA FE, Texas (AP) -- Amanda Bruce thinks she knows why so few
classmates and neighbors have joined her in speaking out against
public prayers at high school football games.
</P>
<P>
   ''They're scared they'll be shunned by the community or be
labeled an atheist or devil worshipper like I was,'' said the
18-year-old senior, who wrote newspaper columns against the
practice.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly five years after two families filed a lawsuit against the
Santa Fe school district over the prayers, the U.S. Supreme Court
will hear oral arguments in the case on Wednesday. It will be the
court's first major school prayer ruling since 1992, when it barred
clergy-led invocations and benedictions at graduation ceremonies.
</P>
<P>
   At issue is whether public school districts can allow students
to initiate and lead prayers over the public-address system before
the football games. A decision is expected by late June.
</P>
<P>
   For some of the 10,000 residents of Santa Fe, a bedroom
community 40 miles southeast of Houston with more churches than
restaurants, the Supreme Court's decision has profound personal
implications.
</P>
<P>
   If prayer at sporting events is upheld, ''it probably will
destroy my faith in the Constitution and what this country stands
for,'' said Debbie Mason, a Baptist who testified for the
plaintiffs in the lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   On the other side, school board President John Couch II foresees
trouble if prayer is disallowed.
</P>
<P>
   ''It would be a huge disappointment not only for us but for the
nation,'' he said. ''Students and private citizens would have their
rights taken away from them on public property. I think it would be
the start of further downfalls.''
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George W. Bush, who is seeking the Republican presidential
nomination, and state Attorney General John Cornyn filed briefs
supporting student-led prayer.
</P>
<P>
   The identities of the two families who filed the lawsuit -- one
Catholic and one Mormon -- were sealed by the courts.
</P>
<P>
   Their lawsuit alleged that the school district's policy of
allowing students to lead prayers at home football games violated
the First Amendment by creating a ''pervasive religious
atmosphere.''
</P>
<P>
   Mason, whose four children attended Santa Fe schools, said about
25 families, angered by numerous incidents including distribution
of Gideon Bibles at Santa Fe High School, considered joining the
suit but most dropped out as the conflict drew widespread
attention.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld a
federal judge's ruling that ''nonsectarian and non-proselytizing''
prayer could be allowed at public school events such as graduation.
</P>
<P>
   The judge had also allowed the same limited prayers at football
games. But the 5th Circuit said those prayers are out of bounds,
ruling that the games are ''hardly the sober type of annual event
that can be appropriately solemnized with prayer.''
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court is limiting its review to only the
prayers-at-football games issue.
</P>
<P>
   The school district responded to the 5th Circuit ruling by
crafting strict guidelines banning pre-game prayer, and warned
senior Marian Ward, elected by fellow students to deliver brief
messages solemnizing football games, that she would be disciplined
if she prayed.
</P>
<P>
   Ward's family filed suit in September, arguing that the
guidelines violated her free speech rights. A U.S. District Court
judge agreed that the guidelines the school had written were
unconstitutional and ruled that the school could not censor Ward's
speech.
</P>
<P>
   Ward was given a standing ovation when she delivered a prayer
before the school's football home season opener.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month in Texas' Republican primary, 94 percent of
voters approved a nonbinding resolution backing student-initiated
prayer at school sporting events.
</P>
<P>
   Couch and Mayor Robert Cheek say the vast majority of Santa Fe
residents favor prayer at football games. They downplay reports of
friction between the sides, but admit that peer pressure might
prevent some discussion.
</P>
<P>
   ''Anti-prayer is not a popular opinion,'' Cheek said. ''I guess
when you have an overwhelming majority supporting prayer, there are
probably those who are scared to come forward.''
</P>
<P>
   Mason, Bruce and only a handful of other people held a
demonstration at the homecoming game in October. They say they
represent a large silent contingent that believes pre-game prayer
wrongly entangles church and state.
</P>
<P>
   ''Deep inside, I know it's not right for someone to take
advantage of a public forum to broadcast their religious beliefs,''
said Bruce, a Roman Catholic. ''People need to think about the
person sitting next to them who may not be a Christian.''

<HEADLINE> Ventura To Lobby on China Trade  </HEADLINE>
By JONATHAN D. SALANT, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Minnesota Gov. Jesse Ventura says he will work
to help the Clinton administration win passage in Congress of
permanent normal trade relations with China.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've been asked by the administration to take a very lead role
on trade of which I'm honored, and I will take that lead,'' Ventura
said on ''Fox News Sunday.'' ''I believe in doing what's best for
our country, and if I can help, I'll doggone well do it.
</P>
<P>
   Ventura was scheduled to testify Thursday before the House Ways
and Means Committee.
</P>
<P>
   When Ventura was in Washington for a recent National Governors'
Association meeting, he told Clinton he was a strong supporter of
China's entry into the World Trade Organization, White House
spokesman Jake Siewert said Sunday. The president said he hoped
Ventura would play a visible role.
</P>
<P>
   ''Obviously we appreciate his support and hope he's visible on
this because he speaks for an important and substantial portion of
the American people,'' Siewert said from Geneva, where Clinton met
with Syrian President Hafez Assad.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is asking Congress to pass legislation that would award
China permanent normal trade status with the United States in
return for China's agreement to drop trade barriers that American
manufacturers and farmers have complained cost them billions of
dollars in lost export sales.
</P>
<P>
   China made the market-opening offers to get U.S. support for its
membership in the WTO.
</P>
<P>
   ''If we turn our back on China, rest assured the other nations
throughout the world are not going to turn their back on them,''
Ventura said. ''Our farmers in Minnesota are hurting right now.
They need those markets.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and the nation's business community strongly support
normal trade relations, while organized labor is just as
steadfastly opposed.
</P>
<P>
   Ventura said labor's position was wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ''They better modernize themselves and realize that opening up
China to our trade is going to create more jobs here,'' Ventura
said. ''Because we're in a position where we're giving up nothing.
Whatever China is sending here now, they'll continue to send here.
But what is happening here is tariffs are going to go down, markets
in China are going to go open up.''
</P>
<P>
   The free flow of goods eventually may bring down the communist
government, Ventura said.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is going to be the biggest thing of this century because
it could change the face of the Earth and I believe it could be the
downfall of communism in China, long term, way down the line,''
Ventura said.
</P>
<P>
   Ventura also plans a trade mission to China in the next 12
months to 18 months.

<HEADLINE> Exhibit Focuses on Gay Nazi Victims  </HEADLINE>
By PAUL GEITNER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN (AP) -- Focusing attention on a long-neglected group of
Nazi victims, a two-part exhibition about gays persecuted under the
Nazis opened Sunday at museums in Berlin and in a former
concentration camp where many of the victims were killed.
</P>
<P>
   The exhibits of documents, photos, drawings and other objects
collected during 10 years of research is the largest on the subject
ever mounted in Germany, project organizers said. It documents the
fate of 700 individuals who suffered under the Nazis' draconian
anti-gay laws and tells 60 personal stories.
</P>
<P>
   ''We want to return to the gay victims of the Nazis their names
and to show their lives, as far as possible, so as to at least
symbolically liberate them from the dehumanizing barbarity of the
Nazis,'' said Andreas Sternweiler, project director at the Gay
Museum in Berlin, where part of the exhibit is being shown.
</P>
<P>
   The other half opened at the Sachsenhausen concentration camp,
where many gay men -- labeled with a pink triangle -- ended up
because of the camp's proximity to the capital. Some 600
homosexuals were killed there between 1939 and mid-1943 alone,
according to the researchers.
</P>
<P>
   The Nazi anti-gay law, known as ''Paragraph 175,'' was directly
solely against gay men, since the Nazis were mainly concerned with
perceived threats to their ideal of Aryan manhood. Lesbians were
generally ignored, although some were arrested as ''asocials'' or
''prostitutes.''
</P>
<P>
   Few surviving victims ever came forward after World War II
because of continuing stigma associated with homosexuality, which
remained illegal in West Germany under the same Nazi law until
1969. Tens of thousands of men were prosecuted in those postwar
years.
</P>
<P>
   Historians also generally ignored the Nazi persecution of
homosexuals until the 1980s, meaning many survivors had already
passed away, organizers said. Only a handful are known to still be
alive; their stories are told in a U.S.-made documentary,
''Paragraph 175,'' which won awards at film festivals in Berlin and
at Sundance this year.
</P>
<P>
   Germany's center-left government introduced a bill last week --
55 years after the end of the war -- that would require parliament
to officially recognize and apologize to gay victims.
</P>
<P>
   It also calls on the government to study whether a blanket
annulment should be issued for convictions under the Nazi anti-gay
law, under which even a glance between men could be cause for
prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   Guenter Morsch, director of the Sachsenhausen memorial, noted
that protests erupted after the first plaque dedicated to gay
victims of the Nazis was hung at the Dachau concentration camp
outside Munich in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Germany's national Holocaust memorial day
commemorated gay victims for the first time with a ceremony at
Sachsenhausen.
</P>
<P>
   Events like that and the new exhibit are important, he said,
because all groups -- not just those that are ''politically
correct'' -- must be remembered if tolerance is to be promoted.
</P>
<P>
   About 200,000 people were interred at Sachsenhausen between 1936
and 1945, including Jews, Roma, communists and other political
prisoners. More than 1,400 Jews were killed there, thousands more
sent off to be killed in Auschwitz. Others were forced to work in
adjacent factories.

<HEADLINE> Once an open race, Academy Awards down to solid favorite  </HEADLINE>
By BOB THOMAS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Once upon a time, the 72nd Academy Awards
race was wide open. But by the time Sunday's ceremony rolled
around, there was little doubt around Hollywood that a modestly
budgeted film about family dysfunction would win top honors.
</P>
<P>
   ''American Beauty'' had already topped most critic lists going
into the weekend. Then came its best picture win in Friday's
controversial Wall Street Journal poll of 356 of the 5,607 voting
Academy members.
</P>
<P>
   Scientific or not, the survey was ''American Beauty's'' clincher
for best buzz going into the four-hour Oscar show, broadcast on ABC
with Billy Crystal as host.
</P>
<P>
   The poll's other favorites also seemed to reflect pre-Oscar
conventional wisdom: Denzel Washington for leading actor in ''The
Hurricane,'' Hilary Swank for leading actress in ''Boys Don't
Cry,'' Michael Caine for supporting actor in ''The Cider House
Rules,'' and Angelina Jolie for supporting actress in ''Girl
Interrupted.''
</P>
<P>
   After the nominations were announced Feb. 16, it appeared that
''The Cider House Rules,'' a period piece about a New England
orphanage, had the edge for best picture. After all, it was the
kind of poignant, panoramic movie Academy voters traditionally
favor.
</P>
<P>
   Its standing heightened as Miramax poured money into trade paper
and newspaper ads for ''Cider House,'' a technique that had
succeeded with the company's winner last year, ''Shakespeare in
Love.''
</P>
<P>
   DreamWorks countered with its own campaign for ''American
Beauty,'' and the tide shifted.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   The awards show capped one of the most bizarre Oscar seasons.
</P>
<P>
   First, Academy voters complained that they hadn't received their
ballots for the final vote. By the time a large supply of the
ballots was found in a post office, the Academy had printed new
ballots. The Academy also extended the voting deadline a few days
to last Thursday, meaning the accountants had to work overtime on
awards weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Then came The Mystery of the Missing Oscars.
</P>
<P>
   A shipment of 55 shiny new Oscar statuettes from the Chicago
manufacturer disappeared from a loading dock at Roadway Express on
March 8. Salvage man Willie Fulgear stumbled across 52 of the
missing awards while rummaging through a trash container. Three
Oscars remain missing.
</P>
<P>
   Fulgear, 61, became an instant celebrity. He was given a $50,000
reward by the shipping company and two tickets to Sunday's show.
</P>
<P>
   A Roadway trucker was charged with stealing the statuettes.
</P>
<P>
   Weeks before the awards presentations, the Academy announced the
evening's special awards: Warren Beatty was named for the Irving
Thalberg Award for a high level of producing. Among his producer
credits: ''Bonnie and Clyde,'' ''Shampoo,'' ''Reds'' and ''Dick
Tracy.''
</P>
<P>
   Andrzej Wajda, premier director of Poland, won an honorary award
''for showing both the loftiest heights and the darkest depths of
the European soul.'' His films include ''Landscape after Battle,''
''Man of Marble'' and ''Man of Steel.''

<HEADLINE> African Presidents To Attend Talks  </HEADLINE>
By SUKHDEV CHHATBAR, Associated Press writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARUSHA, Tanzania (AP) -- Six African presidents are expected to
attend a special session of Burundi peace talks chaired by former
South African President Nelson Mandela, a senior Tanzanian official
said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The seven-year civil conflict in Burundi has taken at least
200,000 lives, most of them civilian.
</P>
<P>
   Joshua Opanga, the chief of protocol, said the presidents
attending the talks Monday would be Benjamin Mkapa of Tanzania,
Daniel arap Moi of Kenya, Pierre Buyoya of Burundi, Sam Nujoma of
Namibia, Yoweri Museveni of Uganda and Olusegun Obasanjo of
Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
   But Obasanjo's office said Saturday that the Nigerian leader had
no travel plans outside his country in the next few days.
</P>
<P>
   Libya will be represented by Ali Abdulsalum Tricki, minister for
African unity, Opanga said. He said President Omar Bongo of Gabon
had yet to confirm whether he would participate.
</P>
<P>
   Mandela, who became the mediator of the talks late last year,
met March 20 in South Africa with Jean-Bosco Ndayikengurukiye, head
of the Forces for the Defense of Democracy, who told him the group,
which draws support from the majority Hutus, would be willing to
participate in the talks that began in June 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The National Liberation Front, Burundi's second largest Hutu
rebel group, which is also fighting the Tutsi-dominated military,
has also agreed to take part in the talks.
</P>
<P>
   The rebel groups are not expected to participate in the two-day
talks because they have not had time to prepare.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Bomani, Mandela's aide, said last week that the special
session in the northern town of Arusha would deal, among other
things, with the issue of the participation of the FDD and FNL.
</P>
<P>
   Bomani said Mandela would meet with the heads of the 18
delegations that have been trying to find a way to end the civil
conflict, to determine the date and venue for a possible meeting
between the rebels and Buyoya's government.
</P>
<P>
   The latest conflict in the tiny central African country of 6.5
million began in October 1993 when Tutsi paratroopers assassinated
the country's first democratically elected president, Melchior
Ndadaye, a Hutu.

<HEADLINE> Black Panther To Speak Via Audio  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   YELLOW SPRINGS, Ohio (AP) -- Antioch College's commencement
speaker won't be delivering the keynote address in person, as much
as he might like to.
</P>
<P>
   That's because he's on death row.
</P>
<P>
   Mumia Abu-Jamal, a radio journalist and former Black Panther
activist convicted of killing a Philadelphia police officer in
1981, will speak at the April 29 graduation via audiotape, as he
did last year at Washington's Evergreen State College.
</P>
<P>
   The 45-year-old says his cause has drawn international support
in part because of his 1995 book, ''Live From Death Row,'' which
focuses on race and the justice system. He maintains he is
innocent, and he has a federal appeal pending.
</P>
<P>
   The students asked Abu-Jamal to speak on one of two topics: How
one individual can affect the world or the true meaning of
revolution.
</P>
<P>
   ''The issue is not to get a controversial speaker,'' said senior
Teishan Latner. ''The issue is to raise greater public awareness
for his cause.''

and Branford, gave classical music a bit of a twist this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Marsalis joined more than 100 performers Saturday at the 24-hour
''Bach Around The Clock'' marathon.
</P>
<P>
   The event was to celebrate the 250th anniversary of the death of
Johann Sebastian Bach.
</P>
<P>
   Joined by his younger brother Jason on drums, Marsalis played
Bach pieces transcribed for trombone, his own jazz arrangements of
the old Bach standard ''Sleepers Awake'' and one of the composer's
many minuets.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia's Mahathir Retains Post  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) -- Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad
was assured of retaining the post of ruling party president
unopposed as he has secured enough nominations to make a challenge
impossible, a news report said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Mahathir has ruled Malaysia for the past 18 years and is one of
Asia's longest-serving leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Local party divisions are still sending in nominations for
president of the United Malays National Organization, but as of
Sunday Mahathir had received 133 nominations from 165 divisions,
the national news agency Bernama said.
</P>
<P>
   A candidate needs the backing of at least 50 of UMNO's divisions
nationwide in order to run.
</P>
<P>
   Mahathir's deputy Abdullah Ahmad Badawi has also received enough
nominations to be assured of keeping the party's number two post
unchallenged, Bernama said.
</P>
<P>
   The contest for president and vice president of UMNO is crucial
because the winners traditionally hold the top two government posts
in Malaysia. The party will elect leaders on May 11.
</P>
<P>
   The sole challenger in the race so far had been a former Cabinet
minister, Razaleigh Hamzah, who dropped out last week after
receiving only one nomination.
</P>
<P>
   The party elections come at a time of internal rifts.
</P>
<P>
   Mahathir's sacking of his former deputy Anwar Ibrahim in
September 1998, which sparked unprecedented anti-government
protests, split UMNO and prompted many voters in November general
elections to defect to an Islamic party that supported Anwar.
</P>
<P>
   When Anwar was arrested, thousands of Malaysians took to the
capital's streets and clashed with police in anti-government
demonstrations. The former No. 2 leader is serving a six-year jail
term for abuse of power and is on trial for sodomy. He says he is
innocent.

<HEADLINE> Beached Dolphins Found in S. Africa  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORT ELIZABETH, South Africa (AP) -- Marine wildlife experts were
mystified Sunday by the mass beaching of 28 dolphins, whose
carcasses were found on an isolated shore.
</P>
<P>
   ''We go regularly to get one or two (beached dolphins), but it's
really unusual for a whole lot to strand themselves at the same
time at the same place,'' said Sandy Thackeray, spokeswoman for the
Bayworld Oceanarium in the Indian Ocean City of Port Elizabeth.
</P>
<P>
   Thackeray accompanied a group of scientists and volunteers who
found the dolphins on a long stretch of white sandy beach in the
Woody Cape Nature Reserve, near the Indian Ocean city of Port
Elizabeth. The dolphins had been on the oceanside beach for several
days and were dead by the time the group arrived.
</P>
<P>
   Carcass samples will be autopsied to determine why they may have
beached themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Theories for why such incidents occur range from the mammals
becoming disoriented to beaching themselves in a frantic attempt to
escape predators, Thackeray said.

<HEADLINE> Report of Turkish Troops Build Up  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) -- The Turkish military has been massing
troops and tanks along the Iraqi border in recent weeks, apparently
for a cross-border offensive on Kurdish rebels, a newspaper
reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Turkey has ignored a recent announcement by Kurdish rebels that
the 15-year-long armed struggle for autonomy for the southeast was
over, and the army is determined to crush the guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
   Turkish military officials were not immediately available to
comment on the report in the daily Cumhuriyet.
</P>
<P>
   According to Cumhuriyet, the troops -- aided by pro-Turkey Iraqi
Kurdish fighters from the Kurdistan Democratic Party -- have already
engaged in skirmishes with Kurdish rebels in the northeastern tip
of Iraq. No casualty figure was given.
</P>
<P>
   But the main operation, expected to take place in the coming
days, would involve thousands of Turkish soldiers, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   Army engineers were erecting portable bridges over the Hezil
river, which run along the Iraqi-Turkish border, for possible use
by tanks and trucks, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
   Turkey often sends troops into northern Iraq in the spring after
the snow clears to fight guerrillas who maintain bases in the area,
which has been out of Baghdad's control since the end of the Gulf
War in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels, heeding a call by their imprisoned leader Abdullah
Ocalan, announced an end to fighting in early February. The bulk of
the rebels have retreated to Iraq and Iran under orders from
Ocalan.
</P>
<P>
   Turkish military was also reportedly getting ready to launch an
operation against some 300 Kurdish rebels left on mountain tops
inside Turkey, Cumhuriyet said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, police on Sunday temporarily detained some 100
wedding guests in the southeastern Turkish city of Sanliurfa for
riding in cars decorated with red, green and yellow ribbons -- the
colors of Ocalan's Kurdish rebel banner, the Anatolia news agency
said.
</P>
<P>
   All were released after questioning at a police station.
</P>
<P>
   The incident underlined authorities' sensitivities to the
smallest hints of Kurdish nationalism. Kurds make up about
one-fifth of Turkey's people.

<HEADLINE> Clinton-Assad Summit Rekindles Hope  </HEADLINE>
By TERENCE HUNT, AP White House Correspondent
<TEXT>
<P>
   GENEVA (AP) -- Rekindling hopes for Middle East peace, President
Clinton and Syrian President met Sunday to explore how to resume
Syrian-Israeli negotiations for a landmark agreement that would end
a half century of hostility.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was returning to Washington on Sunday night, White House
spokesman Joe Lockhart said. There was no immediate word of what
progress, if any, had been made in resolving obstacles to a new
round of negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   The talks lasted three hours.
</P>
<P>
   Expectations had been high going into the talks, in part simply
because the 69-year-old Assad, who rarely travels, made a special
trip to Switzerland to see Clinton. But national security adviser
Sandy Berger tried to dampen expectations of immediate results,
saying that the differences between the two sides may be
irreconcilable.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton mediated Israeli-Syrian talks in the United States that
broke off inclusively in January. The president has been working
intensely for their resumption. Time is running out on Clinton's
presidency and his hopes to polish his legacy with a historic
Mideast deal.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, with Clinton in Geneva,
said the president told her on the eve of the Assad meeting that
''the distance between them is short, but the walk is hard.'' She
also said on CBS' ''Face the Nation'' that Clinton was taking
''somewhat of a risk'' in talking with Assad, because the outcome
was not known in advance.
</P>
<P>
   The White House would not say before the meeting whether Clinton
carried a specific message or an overture from Israel.
</P>
<P>
   In Jerusalem, aides said Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak spoke
to Clinton by telephone just before Clinton met Assad. The prime
minister's office would not give details of the conversation.
</P>
<P>
   The outlines of an agreement already are well known -- a return
of the strategic Golan Heights to Syria in exchange for security
guarantees for Israel and normalization of relations. Peace in
Lebanon would follow any agreement with Syria, which controls its
neighbor's military, politics and economy.
</P>
<P>
   But the two sides still have to agree on how far Israel
withdraws from the Golan, security arrangements, water rights from
territory Israel surrenders and normalization of relations.
</P>
<P>
   Barak has made a peace deal with Syria a top priority of his
administration. But Israelis want concrete assurances of what they
would get in return. Israel captured the Golan in the 1967 Mideast
War, defended the territory in a bloody war in 1973 and annexed it
in 1981.
</P>
<P>
   Barak, in an interview on ABC's ''This Week,'' said the Geneva
talks will give an indication ''from this highest level of
leadership in Syria ... whether we will have real peace.''
</P>
<P>
   He said Clinton knows the demands of both Israel and Syria.
''The only question that remains is whether those needs could be
brought together in a deal,'' Barak said. ''Tough decisions on both
sides'' are required.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and Assad met in a luxury hotel overlooking Lake Geneva.
It was their first face-to-face summit since 1994 when they met in
Damascus and Geneva. They also saw each other briefly at the
funeral of Jordan's King Hussein in February 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The two sides talked for more than two hours, took a two-hour
break, and then resumed the meeting, Lockhart said. During the
break, Albright met separately with Syrian Foreign Minister Farouk
al-Sharaa, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Albright and Berger accompanied Clinton into the meeting, along
with chief of staff John Podesta, Clinton's Middle East envoy,
Dennis Ross, and another aide.
</P>
<P>
   Assad was accompanied by Sharaa, Abdul Raouf al-Qasem, head of
the National Security Office, and a legal adviser.
</P>
<P>
   Before the meeting began, Berger said the United States hopes
that over the next few weeks the two sides ''will reach the
conclusion that they can enter into a serious round of negotiation.
But that's by no means certain.''
</P>
<P>
   But in Syria, the state-run Syria Times said, ''It seems that
there is ample light for hope.'' It said the summit provided an
opportunity to reveal how much U.S. efforts ''have nudged the
conditions for productive talks into place.''
</P>
<P>
   Another government newspaper in Syria, Tishrin, said the Geneva
meeting was ''the last chance to push forward the peace process.''
</P>
<P>
   In separate interviews broadcast Sunday on ABC, Jordan's King
Abdullah II and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat each expressed
hope for success in Geneva.
</P>
<P>
   ''I believe this is the golden opportunity for the Israelis and
Syrians to achieve some sort of peace,'' Abdullah said.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat, who is engaged in his own fitful peace negotiations with
Israel, said he hopes progress on a deal between Israel and Syria
will generate momentum for a deal with the Palestinians. The United
States had acted as host and go-between in that process, as well.
</P>
<P>
   The president flew to Geneva after a refueling stopover in
Muscat, Oman, at the end of a six-day trip to India, Pakistan and
Bangladesh.
</P>
<P>
   Berger said Clinton would consult with Barak after the meeting
while Assad returns to Damascus to weigh what he learned from
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Assad has not attended any of the Syrian-Israeli negotiating
sessions that have been proceeding in fits and starts since the
process began in 1991. In the latest round, which broke off in
January, al-Sharaa headed the Syrian team while Barak led the
Israeli side.

<HEADLINE> Jersey's hot housing market results in higher home prices  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEWARK, N.J. (AP) -- Throughout New Jersey, the average price of
homes and condominiums is rising -- a boon to homeowners trying to
sell, but a disadvantage for those seeking a new place to live.
</P>
<P>
   Median prices for homes in some places shot up by more than 40
percent, according to analysis of 1995 and 1999 residential sales
by The Star-Ledger of Newark.
</P>
<P>
   Among the areas whose housing prices have increased the most are
Hunterdon, Essex, Morris and Middlesex counties.
</P>
<P>
   The largest number of residential properties sold throughout the
state ranged in price from $100,000 to $200,000, while the number
of houses priced above $600,000 more than doubled -- from 671 in
1995 to 1,481 in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper's analysis, published in Sunday's editions, was
based on an examination of more than 100,000 property deeds
recorded in county courthouses in 1995 and 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Cantwell, who bought a house in Chatham Township three years
ago for $210,000, has been among those to benefit from the hot
housing market.
</P>
<P>
   When his family grew and the house wasn't large enough for them,
Cantwell sold it -- for $342,000 -- and used the money to purchase a
bigger home about a mile away.
</P>
<P>
   Large increases in property values were found in other parts of
New Jersey, even in places where housing prices had long been
stagnant.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest increases were found in affluent communities such as
Upper Montclair, Short Hills, Summit, Harding and Basking Ridge.
Those areas have always been desirable, said James Hughes, dean of
the Edward J. Bloustein School of Planning and Public Policy at
Rutgers University.
</P>
<P>
   ''These are places where -- if you made it and have the resources
-- that's where you want to be,'' Hughes said.
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey ranks 19th in the United States in increased housing
costs, according to a recent report by the Office of Federal
Housing Enterprise Oversight. Massachusetts ranked as the highest;
Idaho was the lowest.
</P>
<P>
   The increase in wealth is also helping spur an increase in home
renovations, according to Christopher Mayer, a professor of real
estate at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School.
</P>
<P>
   But as Mayer discovered, finding a contractor can be difficult
when other homeowners are having similar work done to their houses.
</P>
<P>
   ''The prices come in very high, and it's hard to find someone to
do the work,'' Mayer said. ''There's been no slowdown whatsoever in
the renovation market.''
</P>
<P>
   The down side to the housing boom is that the increased cost of
homes has cut back on what is affordable, according to Arnold
Cohen, policy coordinator for the Affordable Housing Network, an
advocacy group in Trenton.
</P>
<P>
   ''The problem is if I sell, I have to buy something else. The
appreciation in value is only helpful if you are leaving this part
of the country,'' Cohen said. ''If you are moving to Florida, it's
one thing. But any place you look around here is going to be more
expensive.''
</P>
<P>
   Rents in Jersey City, for example, have reached $1,000 a month
for a minimal apartment.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's not the Gold Coast,'' Cohen said. ''That's Jersey
City.''
</P>
<P>
   People who buy houses now at the height of the market could also
experience substantial losses if they sell too soon after the
market turns downward. Buyers who purchased homes at the last peak
in 1987 lost thousands in equity after they sold, Hughes said.

<HEADLINE> Scalpers Work Around NCAA Ban  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Scalpers banned from selling NCAA Final Four
basketball tickets in Indianapolis have taken their business across
the county line.
</P>
<P>
   At the prodding of the NCAA, officials passed an ordinance
outlawing ticket scalping in Marion County, which contains
Indianapolis. The ban applies only to the Final Four.
</P>
<P>
   ''Seeing a bunch of hawkers is not an appealing atmosphere,''
said Maribeth Smith, an organizer with the NCAA. ''The desire (is)
to make this a wholesome, clean environment. This is college
sports.''
</P>
<P>
   But when a Final Four ticket package with a face value of $120
can fetch more than 50 times that amount, scalpers find ways to
avoid the law's reach.
</P>
<P>
   Great Seats, a ticket brokerage in Indianapolis, transferred its
Final Four business to the Johnson County house of one of its
principals, Steve Wyatt.
</P>
<P>
   Ticket Source of Indianapolis moved its Final Four business to
its Greenfield office, about 20 miles away in Hancock County.
</P>
<P>
   ''The police did come around to give out copies of the ordinance
to make sure everyone is aware,'' said Ticket Source's Trena Goble.
</P>
<P>
   The 1998 ordinance allows ticket holders to sell their tickets --
but only at face value, or for a small profit. The price of the
ticket can't be raised by more than $10 under the rule.
</P>
<P>
   The Indianapolis Police Department plans to have officers
stationed in locations where scalping traditionally has been fast
and furious, including outside the RCA Dome.

<HEADLINE> Russian Voters Make Voices Known  </HEADLINE>
By ANNA DOLGOV, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- Though voters knew acting President Vladimir Putin
would dominate Sunday's presidential election, millions of Russians
still showed up to vote -- some driven by hope for change, others
out of protest or a sense of duty to democracy.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't know what will happen. But I think (Putin) will be a
good ruler,'' said a retired cafeteria worker, Zoya Kochetkova, who
came out to vote in Moscow despite snowy, overcast weather and
gusts of biting wind.
</P>
<P>
   Putin's lead in opinion polls over his opponents had been so
large that it would have seemed like a time for his critics to give
in and enjoy a day off.
</P>
<P>
   But more Putin opponents turned out Sunday than pollsters had
expected, threatening to push him into a second round of voting
against Communist leader Gennady Zyuganov. If Putin doesn't win 50
percent of the vote Sunday, a runoff must be held between the top
two vote-getters.
</P>
<P>
   ''Maybe because of a lack of an alternative (to Putin), many
people try to resist,'' said Faina Kholodnaya. ''We voted for
resistance.''
</P>
<P>
   For Kholodnaya, that meant voting for reformist lawmaker Grigory
Yavlinsky, who came in third in the 1996 presidential election.
</P>
<P>
   Mikhail Yasenev, a 38-year-old businessman, said he voted for
Yavlinsky to express support for the lawmaker's liberal ideas but
also to make Putin's lead less overwhelming.
</P>
<P>
   ''I still want to take some kind of part in this,'' said a
38-year-old businessman, Mikhail Yasenev.
</P>
<P>
   Zyuganov, who offered a strong challenge to incumbent Boris
Yeltsin in 1996, relied on a devoted following of mostly elderly
voters to gain a distant second in most polls.
</P>
<P>
   An 83-year-old retired air force colonel who gave his first name
as Nikolai thought Putin would win, but said he has been a member
of the Communist Party since 1938 and has never let down the party.

<TEXT>
<P>
   CHARLESTON, S.C. (AP) -- Hip-hop artist Wyclef Jean canceled his
performance here to support the NAACP's boycott of South Carolina,
called to protest the state's flying of the Confederate flag, his
publicist said.
</P>
<P>
   Jean was supposed to perform at a concert sponsored by the
College of Charleston last Friday, but he dropped out when he found
out about the booking.
</P>
<P>
   Publicist Miguel Baguer said the performer didn't ''become aware
of the show until Thursday.''
</P>
<P>
   ''When he realized it, he said, 'Oh my God I can't do South
Carolina because of the NAACP sanctions against South Carolina.' So
that's what happened,'' Baguer said.
</P>
<P>
   The NAACP has urged travelers and entertainers to avoid South
Carolina until the state removes the Confederate flag from the
Statehouse dome. The boycott began Jan. 1.

<HEADLINE> Filipinos Sue for War Slave Labor  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MANILA, Philippines (AP) -- Thousands of Filipinos will sue
Japanese companies that allegedly forced them into slave labor
during World War II, a Filipino lawyer said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the Filipinos conscripted into the wartime labor force
by the Japanese occupation army were made to work in mines and
plantations operated by Japanese companies, said lawyer Rod
Domingo.
</P>
<P>
   Domingo said the lawsuit will be consolidated with similar class
action suits filed in California by former prisoners and civilians
from Australia, Canada, China, England, Scotland and the
Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
   He encouraged living victims or their heirs to file claims
against Japanese companies that ''violated their rights or
exploited, enslaved, tortured or profited from their forced labor''
from 1941 to 1945.
</P>
<P>
   ''The sheer volume and complexity of this lawsuit required a
global team of 13 law firms that ask for an accounting and
restitution from Japanese corporations that reaped profits during
the war from the misery, which they have prolonged for the sake of
profitability,'' Domingo said.
</P>
<P>
   Among the companies that may be sued are members of the Mitsui,
Mitsubishi, Matsushita and Hitachi groups, as well as carmakers
Toyota and Nissan, he said.
</P>
<P>
   A research paper on Japanese companies that used slave labor in
the Philippines showed more than a dozen had operated cotton
plantations in more than 10 provinces in northern, central and
southern Philippines covering tens of thousands of acres.
</P>
<P>
   One company, Mitsui Kozan, reportedly used 1.5 million Filipino
workers under life-threatening conditions to reconstruct a copper
mine in Mankayan in northern Benguet province that resistance
fighters had blown up.
</P>
<P>
   Another company, Ishihara Sangyo, also operated an iron and
copper mine in central Antique province using 5,000 to 6,000
workers.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit will be based on a California law that prohibits
slave or forced labor, said Domingo, who helped win a $150 million
settlement for 9,539 Filipinos against the estate of the late
Philippine dictator Ferdinand Marcos for human rights violations.

<HEADLINE> Chechens Cast Ballots in Grozny  </HEADLINE>
By LYOMA TURPALOV, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   GROZNY, Russia (AP) -- Reports of foul play marred voting in
Russia's presidential election in war-ravaged Chechnya on Sunday,
while Russian jets and artillery shelled rebel positions in the
south of the breakaway republic.
</P>
<P>
   Military officials denied reports from within their own ranks
earlier in the day that rebels had seized the mountain town of
Nozhai-Yurt in eastern Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   The streets of Chechnya's cities and towns were bare, and only a
small number of voters could be seen at the polls -- a contrast from
reports from election officials about high turnout.
</P>
<P>
   The chief of Chechnya's election commission, Abdul-Kerim
Arsakhanov, said he expected voter turnout to reach 90 percent of
Chechnya's 480,000 eligible voters. But tens of thousands of
Chechens have been displaced by the 6-month-old war, and few were
expected to make it to the polls.
</P>
<P>
   One election official openly suggested that election workers
were being forced by the government to rig votes in acting
President Vladimir Putin's favor. Putin is expected to win.
</P>
<P>
   ''In any case, we will have to show Putin with a strong lead in
our protocols,'' said Shirvani Murtazov, the head of the election
commission in the Leninsky district of the Chechen capital, Grozny.
</P>
<P>
   Some Chechens interviewed in refugee camps in neighboring
Ingushetia reported cases of coercion by Russian troops.
</P>
<P>
   ''Soldiers were calling at homes and scaring people, saying they
would rob them of all their belongings if they fail to cast
ballots,'' said Lida Saidova, 42, from the village of Orekhovo from
western Achkhoi-Martan region.
</P>
<P>
   ''They grabbed me, brought me to a house and ordered to vote,''
Maka Khanchukayeva, 45, said of an experience in Grozny three days
ago. ''I asked them why should I vote today if the election is set
for Sunday, but they told me it's not my business. So I voted for
Putin just as a soldier told me.''
</P>
<P>
   Refugees were invited to go to temporary polls set up at refugee
camps, but few showed up.
</P>
<P>
   Some 100,000 Russian troops stationed in Chechnya also cast
ballots, and 98 percent of them voted for Putin, the ITAR-Tass news
agency reported.
</P>
<P>
   The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe did not
send any election observers to Chechnya because their safety could
not be guaranteed, Helle Degn, head of the OSCE mission in Moscow
said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Polls weren't set in the Shatoi, Itum-Kale and Vedeno regions in
southern Chechnya where remaining rebel forces were reportedly
based.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Col.-Gen Alexander Baranov, chief of staff for the
Russian troops in Chechnya, said that federal jets and artillery on
Sunday shelled suspected rebel locations near the mountainous town
of Tsentoroi, some 30 miles southeast of Grozny.
</P>
<P>
   He dismissed reports about rebels seizing the town of
Nozhai-Yurt in the same area.
</P>
<P>
   Interfax, citing the headquarters of the combined federal forces
in the North Caucasus, had reported earlier Sunday that up to 2,000
rebels had slowly infiltrated Nozhai-Yurt over the past several
days.
</P>
<P>
   The military has stepped up security throughout Chechnya,
fearing that rebels would launch attacks to thwart voting, but no
serious clashes were reported.
</P>
<P>
   Russian ground troops entered Chechnya in late September after
rebels invaded the neighboring Russian region of Dagestan last
summer.
</P>
<P>
   Putin's popularity soared partly because of his strict position
against Chechen rebels.

<HEADLINE> Poll finds big contrasts in views of North, South Jersey  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) -- North Jersey has better schools and
colleges, higher-paying jobs and better public transportation, but
more criminals than the southern part of the state, according to
the latest Gannett New Jersey poll.
</P>
<P>
   Poll respondents said South Jersey residents are friendlier, but
they were evenly split about which half of the state they prefer.
Forty percent told interviewers they like South Jersey best, while
41 percent preferred North Jersey and 19 percent were undecided.
</P>
<P>
   The poll of residents' attitudes found some perceive that the
northern half of the state gets preferential treatment from state
government -- possibly because of corruption.
</P>
<P>
   ''Oh, the north is treated better. No question. That's where the
money is. You want a politician? You buy one. Or rent one. They
don't care,'' 70-year-old Arthur Clarke of Old Bridge in Middlesex
County told the Gannett New Jersey Bureau for Sunday's editions.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-two percent of those surveyed said state government
provides more support for people in North Jersey, compared with
only 5 percent who think South Jersey residents get more
assistance. However, 53 percent said the two regions get equal
support and 20 percent were undecided or refused to answer.
</P>
<P>
   The poll, taken by telephone survey of 571 adults from March 16
through March 18, had a margin of error of 4.1 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   Sponsored by Gannett's seven daily newspapers in New Jersey, the
poll designated 13 counties as being in North Jersey, with only
these eight counties considered to be in South Jersey: Atlantic,
Burlington, Camden, Cape May, Cumberland, Gloucester, Ocean and
Salem.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone agreed with those divisions, however.
</P>
<P>
   Clarke, for example, considers himself a resident of Central
Jersey. Likewise, Rosette Leone, 59, of Union Township in Hunterdon
County said although her area was designated as part of North
Jersey, it's far from the smokestacks and oil refineries that flank
the New Jersey Turnpike as it meanders north.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's a big horse farm right across the street from us,''
Leone said.
</P>
<P>
   On the question of which region has the friendliest residents,
42 percent chose South Jersey, 12 percent chose North Jersey, 4
percent were undecided and 42 percent said they didn't know.
</P>
<P>
   Though South Jersey was rated as friendlier, General Chaney, a
black resident of Lumberton in Burlington County, said people in
northern New Jersey cities are ''more comfortable with diversity''
than residents of rural and suburban South Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   South Jersey residents seem more liberal about gun ownership,
Chaney said, but he sees other benefits in the north, such as
generally higher salaries.
</P>
<P>
   ''They have access to better public transportation,'' added
Chaney, 53.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, 63 percent of those surveyed said more criminals live
in North Jersey than in South Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   On education, 50 percent said North Jersey had the best
colleges, compared with 23 percent who picked South Jersey and 15
percent who thought the two areas have equal higher-education
opportunities. North Jersey also was credited with having better
public high schools by 37 percent of respondents, while 24 percent
chose South Jersey's public schools, 20 percent rated them equally
and 18 percent were undecided.
</P>
<P>
   On other questions, only 15 percent of respondents root for the
Philadelphia Eagles, compared with 50 percent who support the New
York Giants, and less than half could say correctly whether the
current and previous governors are from the North or South. Still,
85 percent said it made no difference whether a gubernatorial
candidate lived in northern or southern New Jersey.

<HEADLINE> Philippines To Pursue Stock Probe  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BAGUIO, Philippines (AP) -- President Joseph Estrada said Sunday
securities regulators will challenge a court order temporarily
halting the investigation into a stock trading scandal that
involves one of his associates.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, Estrada swore into office former trade
undersecretary Lilia Bautista as chairman of the Securities and
Exchange Commission, replacing Perfecto Yasay. Yasay had claimed
the president pressured him to clear a friend in the SEC's probe of
BW Resources Corp., the gambling company at the center of the
country's biggest stock market scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Estrada has vehemently denied the charges and called Yasay a
liar.
</P>
<P>
   Asked by reporters whether the SEC under Bautista will challenge
the court order, Estrada said, ''Yes, yes. I think the new chairman
of the SEC will take care of that.''
</P>
<P>
   The Court of Appeals issued a restraining order Wednesday
temporarily stopping the SEC's investigation until the court can
evaluate a complaint by a businessman implicated in the scandal
that he was not given a chance to tell his side of the story.
</P>
<P>
   The court order was sought by Jimmy Juan, an employee of a
company owned by Dante Tan, a major BW shareholder and friend of
Estrada's. Both Juan and Tan were implicated in trading
irregularities in an earlier investigation into BW by the
Philippine Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Investor confidence in the Philippines has plunged as a result
of the BW scandal and allegations of an attempt by Estrada to cover
up involvement of his friend.

<HEADLINE> G8 Summit To Have Asian Flavor  </HEADLINE>
By ERIC TALMADGE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NAGO, Japan (AP) -- Asian concerns will be high on the agenda
when Japan hosts this year's G8 summit, a meeting traditionally
dominated by the United States and Europe, Prime Minister Keizo
Obuchi said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The annual summit of the leaders of the world's top
industrialized nations and Russia will be returning this July to
Asia for the first time since 1993, when it was held in Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   Obuchi commented on the summit after wrapping up a weekend trip
to inspect facilities for the three-day meetings in the city of
Nago in Okinawa prefecture (state).
</P>
<P>
   Obuchi, who handpicked Okinawa to be the G8 host, said issues of
particular concern to Asia include development, global financial
reforms and education.
</P>
<P>
   ''While keeping a global viewpoint, I hope the concerns of the
countries of Asia will be reflected in the summit discussions,'' he
said, without going into further details.
</P>
<P>
   Japan is the only Asian member of the G8. The other member
nations are the United States, Germany, England, Italy, France,
Canada and Russia.
</P>
<P>
   ''I want the other summit leaders to feel the significance of
hosting the meeting in Okinawa,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The choice of Okinawa as host has been very controversial in
Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Roughly half of the 52,000 U.S. troops stationed in Japan are
concentrated on bases on Okinawa, a load which many Okinawans feel
is too heavy. Nago has become the center of the bases debate
because it has been chosen as the site of a new heliport for the
Marines.
</P>
<P>
   The plan has bogged down because Okinawa's governor has demanded
that the heliport be returned to civilian use after 15 years, a
condition U.S. officials have said they will not accept.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton is due to attend the summit, which would make
him the first U.S. president to visit Okinawa since it was returned
to Japanese administration in 1972. Before that, the United States
governed Okinawa from 1945.

<HEADLINE> Pope Ends Holy Land Pilgrimage  </HEADLINE>
By JOCELYN NOVECK, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM (AP) -- Pope John Paul II crowned his Holy Land sojourn
Sunday with a stunning gesture to the Jews at their holiest site,
shuffling slowly up to the Western Wall and placing a plea for
forgiveness in a nook between its yellowed stones.
</P>
<P>
   The gesture by the 79-year-old ailing pontiff was sure to become
the most indelible image in a week of unforgettable moments.
</P>
<P>
   It came on a whirlwind final day that saw the pope visit the
sacred sites of all three faiths, all within the confines of
Jerusalem's walled Old City, one of the most disputed patches of
land in the world.
</P>
<P>
   At the Church of the Holy Sepulcher, the pontiff knelt at the
spot where tradition says Jesus was resurrected. At the Haram
as-Sharif, the hilltop where Muslims say the prophet Mohammed
ascended to heaven, he met with Jerusalem's top Islamic cleric.
</P>
<P>
   At each stop, he couldn't help but witness the passionate
dispute over a city that both Israelis and Palestinians claim as
their capital. But many who glimpsed him witnessed something
equally potent: the charisma and healing power of this aging,
ailing pontiff.
</P>
<P>
   ''Some wonderful things are going to happen in this century,''
said Bishop William Murphy of Boston, who followed the weeklong
journey. ''And I think that this week, we saw the beginning of
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Hunched and leaning on a cane, the pontiff showed doubters he
was more than up to the rigors of an ambitious and grueling
itinerary.
</P>
<P>
   Not only did he uphold his entire packed schedule, he managed to
squeeze in an impromptu second look at the Church of the Holy
Sepulcher before flying back to Rome Sunday evening. He even
hoisted himself up on the running board of his Chevy Suburban and
waved, drawing cheers from delighted tourists.
</P>
<P>
   But for Israelis, the highlight of the day, and indeed the week,
was when the pope navigated the 86 steps it took him to reach the
Western Wall and place a note in its stones, echoing a tradition of
generations of Jewish worshippers. He had earlier in the week
reached out to Jews at their Holocaust memorial, Yad Vashem. But
this was a gesture at the holiest site of all Judaism.
</P>
<P>
   The pope's words were from an address he made earlier this month
in Rome, expressing sorrow over the past errors of his church.
</P>
<P>
   ''God of our fathers, you chose Abraham and his descendants to
bring your Name to the Nations,'' read the typewritten message.
''We are deeply saddened by the behavior of those who in the course
of history have caused these children of yours to suffer and,
asking your forgiveness, we wish to commit ourselves to genuine
brotherhood with the people of the Covenant.''
</P>
<P>
   After a private prayer, the pope made a sign of the cross, then
momentarily placed a trembling hand on the rocks.
</P>
<P>
   The Israeli official in charge of the visit, Moshe Fogel, said
he was only informed 10 minutes ahead of time that the pope was
planning to place a note in the wall.
</P>
<P>
   ''I only imagined a tiny note,'' he said. ''I looked, and this
was a real document, unmistakably spread out for all the world to
see.''
</P>
<P>
   Fearing it would blow away, Fogel recovered the note after the
pope's departure and transferred it to Yad Vashem, ''where it will
remain on display for the world to see, forever.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the religious significance of the day, politics wasn't
far from the minds of either Israelis or Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   East Jerusalem, captured and annexed by Israel after the 1967
Mideast war, is claimed by Palestinians as the capital of a future
independent state. Israel insists that the entire city remain its
eternal capital.
</P>
<P>
   The sun-splashed plaza that stretches before the wall was
festooned with dozens of Israeli flags, and when the pope sat in
his blue armchair on the podium, seven huge Israeli flags were
clustered strategically behind him.
</P>
<P>
   Not to be outdone, the Palestinians released a phalanx of
balloons in the red, white, black and green colors of their flag,
plus an actual flag tethered to a balloon, sending them floating
over the plaza a half hour before the pope's arrival.
</P>
<P>
   Political tensions were also in full display at the pope's
earlier visit to Haram as-Sharif and its Al Aqsa Mosque complex,
the third-holiest Islamic shrine. The site is holy as well to Jews,
who call it the Temple Mount.
</P>
<P>
   There, the pontiff was greeted by the top Islamic cleric in
Jerusalem, or mufti, who wasted no time in bringing up the status
of Jerusalem. ''The holy city of Jerusalem has been eternally
bonded to Islam,'' said Ikrema Sabri.
</P>
<P>
   But the pope steered a cautious path, saying the city ''has
always been revered by Jews, Christians and Muslims.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the pope made his way through the treacherously narrow
streets of the Old City to celebrate Mass at the cavernous,
tallow-scented Church of the Holy Sepulcher, where many Christians
believe Jesus was crucified, buried and rose from the dead. He was
surrounded by clerics from the Christian sects that share a
sometimes acrimonious custody of the church.
</P>
<P>
   When the journey was over, all were left to digest the
consequences.
</P>
<P>
   For Palestinians, it had been an opportunity to hear the pope
endorse their dreams of a homeland -- though without entering
politics as much as they would have liked.
</P>
<P>
   For Israelis, the visit meant a kind of validation no pope had
ever given the young nation. And the emotional visits to Yad Vashem
and the wall were widely seen as a huge step forward in
Jewish-Catholic relations, even if the pope's specific words didn't
satisfy every Jew.
</P>
<P>
   For Christians, who form only 2 percent of the Holy Land and
whose numbers are dwindling, it was a boost like no other.
</P>
<P>
   ''This has been great,'' said Alex Rosen, a 20-year-old student
from Dusseldorf, Germany, who came to the wall to glimpse the
pontiff. ''He's taken 10 steps in one.''

<HEADLINE> Swiss Jet Makes Emergency Landing  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BASEL, Switzerland (AP) -- A Swiss plane with 150 passengers
bound from Cairo to Switzerland made an emergency landing in Crete
after a cargo door came open shortly after takeoff, the airline
said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Crossair, a Swiss regional airline, blamed Egyptian ground staff
for failing to close the door. Egyptian airport officials seemed
unaware of the incident and said the doors were shut properly as
the plane left Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The door came open shortly after takeoff, preventing the buildup
of cabin pressure necessary for the plane to gain height, said
Crossair security official Matthias Schmid.
</P>
<P>
   The weight of the fuel made it too risky to land back at Cairo,
so the pilot flew the MD83 at low altitude for two hours to
Heraklion airport on the Greek island of Crete.
</P>
<P>
   ''Passengers didn't notice anything was wrong until they arrived
in Crete,'' said Schmid.
</P>
<P>
   Schmid said there were no injuries or panic. Visibly relieved
but tired passengers arrived on a replacement plane in the northern
Swiss city of Basel on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Schmid placed the blame on the Egyptian loading crew. He said an
indicator in the cockpit showed that a cargo door was open. The
pilot checked and was assured twice by ground staff that it had
been closed and so took off on the assumption that the warning
light was malfunctioning.
</P>
<P>
   But Egyptian airport officials, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said they had received no complaints from Crossair and
were unaware of any problems. Officials from Alamia, a private
company that services Crossair flights in Egypt, said the cargo
door was shut on the exterior when the flight took off.
</P>
<P>
   The Swiss airliner has been plagued by incidents in recent
weeks. A Crossair Saab 340 plane crashed into a field shortly after
takeoff in January, killing all 10 on board. Swiss investigating
authorities are expected to issue an interim report Tuesday into
the causes of that crash.

<HEADLINE> Swiss Accuse Austrians of Spying  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERN, Switzerland (AP) -- Switzerland has launched an
investigation against Austrian customs officials for spying on
smuggling bands operating in Swiss territory.
</P>
<P>
   Swiss justice ministry spokesman Folco Galli said Sunday that
the Austrians were accused of ''illegal activities for a foreign
state'' and that the case had been handed over to the Swiss Federal
Prosecutor.
</P>
<P>
   The affair threatens to cast a shadow over a visit by Austrian
Chancellor Wolfgang Schuessel to Switzerland next Friday and may
sour the warm relations between the two neutral neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   Switzerland has refused to follow the European Union and impose
diplomatic sanctions against the Austrian government following the
inclusion of the far-right Freedom Party in the new ruling
coalition. The Austrian chancellor traditionally makes his first
state visit to Switzerland after taking office -- a tradition that
the Swiss have upheld even though Schuessel has been given the cold
shoulder elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Galli confirmed a report in the Swiss SonntagsZeitung newspaper
that a number of Austrian customs officials had gone behind the
backs of their Swiss colleagues in trying to gather information
about weapons, cigarette and meat smuggling bands operating in
Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
   They now risk imprisonment if they set foot on Swiss soil again.
</P>
<P>
   The Swiss take a dim view of any perceived foreign snooping. A
Swiss court last November gave a German official a 30-day suspended
jail sentence for trying to spy on the Church of Scientology for
German intelligence. And an Israeli Mossad agent, caught in a
bungled 1998 spying operation against an alleged terrorist
sympathizer, is due to go on trial early July.
</P>
<P>
   Austria, like many other European countries, has complained that
Swiss authorities do too little to combat smuggling and other

<HEADLINE> Wisconsin Ready For Next Round  </HEADLINE>
By PETE HERRERA, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. (AP) -- Jim Valvano ran around this court
looking for someone to hug. Seventeen years later, the Wisconsin
Badgers took their turn, dancing on courtside tables.
</P>
<P>
   ''Whatever superlative you can think of, use those words,''
coach Dick Bennett said. ''I feel indescribably happy.''
</P>
<P>
   This was the Badgers' biggest win in 59 years, and it recalled
another great victory in the Pit. North Carolina State and their
late coach completed one of the most storied runs in tournament
history with a last-second win over Houston in the 1983 title game.
</P>
<P>
   Eighth-seed Wisconsin kept its run going with a 64-60 win over
Purdue on Saturday in the West Regional finals.
</P>
<P>
   When it was over, the Wisconsin band blared the old fight song
''On Wisconsin'' as players and fans rushed the court.
</P>
<P>
   Three players jumped on a press row table in front of a large
section of shrieking Wisconsin fans. The table collapsed, sending
writers' laptop computers, soft drinks and the players onto the
court. No one was hurt.
</P>
<P>
   The Badgers (22-13), whose only big-time basketball success came
when they won the NCAA title in 1941, will meet Michigan State
(30-7) in the national semifinals Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   On paper, the Spartans clearly hold the edge. Wisconsin has lost
three times this season to Michigan State. The Badgers are the
lowest-seeded team to advance to the Final Four since 1986 when LSU
made it as a No. 11 seed.
</P>
<P>
   Don't talk to Bennett about that.
</P>
<P>
   ''In this coaching business you learn to live in the present,''
Bennett said. ''You don't dwell on what might be, but you do dream
about it.''
</P>
<P>
   With the Badgers on the same side of The Pit where Valvano and
the Wolfpack won in 1983, Wisconsin beat Purdue for the third time
this season. The victory completed a climb from sixth place in the
Big Ten to a Final Four berth in Indianapolis.
</P>
<P>
   Senior guard Jon Bryant, who transferred from Division II St.
Cloud State in 1997, scored 18 points and made 5-of-9 3-pointers.
He was selected the regional MVP.
</P>
<P>
   ''Their team defense and his 3-pointers really cut our
throats,'' Purdue coach Gene Keady said.
</P>
<P>
   ''What a road,'' Bryant said. ''This last month, we've been
really playing well, but I never felt we could have gotten to the
Final Four to be honest with you.''
</P>
<P>
   A month ago, neither did many Wisconsin fans. The Badgers were
13-12 after a loss to Michigan State on Feb. 19. Bennett was
criticized for mounting losses and boring basketball. Since that
loss, the Badgers went 9-1, the only loss to Michigan State in the
Big Ten tournament.
</P>
<P>
   ''While some of the people who really understand basketball have
respected us, there's a majority of people out there who don't
enjoy the way we play and don't understand why we play the way we
do,'' Badgers guard Mike Kelley said. ''Getting to the Final Four I
think will show the nation what our style of basketball can be
about. It's about winning.''
</P>
<P>
   Wisconsin held the Boilermakers without a field goal for nearly
six minutes late in the game and reserve Roy Boone scored six of
his 12 points in the final 2:45.
</P>
<P>
   The loss deprived Keady of his first trip to the Final Four. It
was the second time the Boilermakers have made it to a regional
final in Keady's 20 years at the school.
</P>
<P>
   ''We just try to play great basketball and if that gets you to
the Final Four, great,'' Keady said. ''You know how hard it is, and
if that bothers a coach, he probably ought to get out of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Wisconsin beat Fresno State, No. 1 seed Arizona, LSU and Purdue
to reach Indianapolis. Kelley, who had five assists and held
Purdue's Jaraan Cornell to 3 points Saturday, insists his team
won't relax now. The Badgers, he says, are not happy simply to get
to the Final Four.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've got such a competitive group, I don't think it matters
if we're playing basketball or bridge,'' he said. ''We're going to
go out and try to win. That's the way we are and I don't think
we're going to go out like that.''

<HEADLINE> Forum Mulls Hedge Fund Disclosure  </HEADLINE>
By DEAN VISSER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SINGAPORE (AP) -- Countries should require large hedge funds to
disclose their capital size and the amount of borrowed money
they're using, a group of finance officials from the world's
richest countries said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The Financial Stability Forum, which met Saturday and Sunday in
Singapore, said such disclosure would help stabilize the global
economy and prevent financial crises like the one that battered
Asia in 1997 and 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Hedge funds are highly leveraged investment devices such as Long
Term Capital Management, whose near collapse in 1998 sent shock
waves through global financial markets.
</P>
<P>
   While the forum stopped short of recommending direct regulation
of hedge funds, delegates warned that they would not discard the
idea entirely.
</P>
<P>
   ''What we favor is a requirement for disclosure of the total
size of the funds, and the leverage,'' Howard Davis, chairman of
the United Kingdom Financial Services Authority, said at a news
conference after the Singapore meeting.
</P>
<P>
   ''But we recognize that that is based on a belief that as long
as you can shine light on this industry, the market will discipline
itself,'' Davies added. ''And we recognize that that may not
happen. Therefore we keep direct regulation on the table.''
</P>
<P>
   The Financial Stability Forum is composed of finance regulators
from the world's seven richest industrial countries, as well as
major developing nations and multinational finance organizations,
including the International Monetary Fund.
</P>
<P>
   The group held discussions in Singapore and released the
findings of three task forces created last year to study ways to
improve the global financial architecture.
</P>
<P>
   The forum's chairman is Andrew Crockett, general manager of the
Bank for International Settlements in Switzerland, which serves as
an international coordinating group for the world's central banks.
</P>
<P>
   The forum on Sunday also recommended a ''code of good practice''
for hedge funds and other highly leveraged institutions operating
in countries with small or medium sized markets, as such firms have
been blamed for destabilizing national economies.
</P>
<P>
   ''Large elephants in small ponds may drain away liquidity for
the rest of the denizens of the ponds, and create problems,''
Davies said.
</P>
<P>
   Davies praised U.S. legislators' proposals to require disclosure
from hedge funds and other highly leveraged institutions, and
called for ''complementary provisions elsewhere.''
</P>
<P>
   The institutions ''shouldn't be able to flit over to London or
to Grand Cayman in order to evade that disclosure requirement,'' he
said.

<HEADLINE> Protests Unprecedented for Pope  </HEADLINE>
By VICTOR L. SIMPSON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM (AP) -- Pope John Paul II has faced protests and
boycotts on some of his 91 foreign trips, ranging from street
demonstrations in Western Europe to a boycott by Buddhists in Sri
Lanka. But it's doubtful that he's gotten an earful like this one
before.
</P>
<P>
   The disputes unleashed during the pontiff's six days in Israel
and the Palestinian territories were nearly unprecedented for papal
trips, which are often scripted down to the smallest details of
protocol and speech exchanges.
</P>
<P>
   There was nothing in the Holy Land this week as dramatic as what
happened during John Paul's 1983 trip to Nicaragua, when the ruling
leftist Sandinista movement disrupted a papal Mass. Instead, he
heard a steady drone from Israelis and Palestinians staking out
their rival claims.
</P>
<P>
   One Muslim leader boycotted a meeting with him. Another stalked
out early from an inter-religious encounter, angered by a rabbi's
remarks claiming -- erroneously -- that the pope endorsed Israeli
control over all of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   And from the moment the pope landed, Israeli officials lost no
opportunity to remind their distinguished guest that Jerusalem,
including its traditionally Arab eastern sector seized by Israel in
the 1967 Middle East war, is the Jewish state's undivided capital.
</P>
<P>
   Church officials insisted it was healthy.
</P>
<P>
   Vatican spokesman Joaquin Navarro-Valls said John Paul saw a
''photograph'' of the situation. ''He got a look at the reality.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Bishop William Murphy of Boston, who attended the stormy
inter-religious meeting, with its mix of Hebrew and Arabic: ''I
don't speak either language and it's probably just as well. But the
pope has been around. I don't believe such things faze him.''
</P>
<P>
   Just before the pope's plane took off for Rome, Navarro-Valls
said the overall impression was that the trip was a success.
</P>
<P>
   ''The pope told everyone the truth without humiliating anyone,''
he said. ''He spoke with love.''
</P>
<P>
   Both sides vied for his support.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, pleased at John Paul's
condemnation of the plight of Palestinian refugees and his call for
a Palestinian homeland, kissed the pope's hand, a rare gesture for
a non-Catholic. A roomful of rabbis -- some of them on record as
wary of the visit by the Roman Catholic leader -- lined up to shake
his hand and praised his efforts for a reconciliation between
Catholics and Jews.
</P>
<P>
   Each side said it was happy with the trip.
</P>
<P>
   ''We were touched with the message that the pope came with,''
said Faisal Husseini, a top Palestinian official. ''He naturalized
the humanity, the courage and we can say that we stayed several
days with a great man.''
</P>
<P>
   Israel's government press spokesman was almost Husseini's echo.
</P>
<P>
   ''The warmth, the real warmth and understanding came to fruition
during this visit,'' Moshe Fogel said. ''It will never be the same
again. It's a new era.''
</P>
<P>
   John Paul accomplished the principal goal of his trip, making
what he called a ''personal, spiritual'' pilgrimage to sites
associated with the life and death of Christ, from his birthplace
in Bethlehem to his tomb in Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   Even doing that gave him an insight into the complexities of the
region: A visit to the Qasr el-Yahud baptismal site was first
proposed by Arafat, even though it is in a mined area on the banks
of the Jordan River under Israeli military control.
</P>
<P>
   The pope went there and prayed. The silence was kept -- neither
Israeli nor Palestinian officials accompanied him on the trip.

<HEADLINE> Lindros Not Planning To Sue Flyers  </HEADLINE>
By ROB MAADDI, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Eric Lindros' father said Sunday his son
will not sue the Philadelphia Flyers for their failure to
immediately diagnose a serious concussion.
</P>
<P>
   Lindros' relationship with the Flyers worsened last week when he
criticized the team's medical staff for not recognizing his
symptoms and allowing him to play four games after he was injured
on March 4.
</P>
<P>
   ''We just want to let the whole thing die,'' said Carl Lindros,
who also is his son's agent. ''Our biggest concern is Eric getting
better and getting back. Eric is feeling better.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. James Kelly, a neurologist at Northwestern University
Medical Center in Chicago, diagnosed Lindros with a Grade II
concussion Tuesday after the team captain was originally believed
to have had a Grade I concussion, the least-severe category.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly said the Flyers star would have immediately been diagnosed
with a Grade II concussion, which can cause memory loss and require
a longer recovery time, had the team's medical staff followed the
American Academy of Neurology guidelines.
</P>
<P>
   ''Eric's concussion should have been identified as a Grade II
concussion at the time, based on his being stunned by the blow, the
visual disturbance he described, and the onset of nausea and
vomiting with headache, within minutes of the injury,'' Kelly said
in a fax sent to Carl Lindros on Friday and distributed to
reporters this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Flyers general manager Bob Clarke, who has stood by the team's
medical staff, said Sunday he has not seen the fax. Clarke would
not comment on the situation other than to say the team would not
name an interim captain.
</P>
<P>
   Lindros will miss the rest of the regular season and at least
the first round of the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Clarke also said Sunday the team ''absolutely'' will make a
qualifying offer to Lindros, who is in the final year of a
one-year, $8.5 million contract. The qualifying offer would prevent
Lindros from becoming an unrestricted free agent, meaning the
Flyers would receive five first-round picks if he signs elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Clarke said he's eager to see Lindros return to the ice
''because he can help our club,'' not to increase his trade value.

<HEADLINE> Group Seeks College Sports Reform  </HEADLINE>
By MIKE BRANOM, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) -- Determined to clean their campuses of
what they say is corruption caused by big money in college
athletics, some academics and administrators are moving to take
back their classrooms.
</P>
<P>
   The Drake Group -- named for the university where the
organization first gathered in October -- passed five proposals
Saturday aimed at regaining control of academics.
</P>
<P>
   ''I want the same protection for my classroom that a coach has
for his practices,'' said Jon Ericson, a rhetoric and
communications professor at Drake.
</P>
<P>
   The reform group is aiming for:
</P>
<P>
   --Eliminating the term ''student-athlete.''
</P>
<P>
   --Removing academic counseling from the control of athletic
departments and abandoning the practice of providing academic
support on the basis of athletic status.
</P>
<P>
   --Public disclosure of academic information for all students,
including academic major, academic adviser, courses and
instructors. No individual's grades shall be released.
</P>
<P>
   --Reducing the number of games.
</P>
<P>
   --Eliminating athletic scholarships while expanding the
availability of need-based aid.
</P>
<P>
   ''These go to the heart of the matter of preserving academic
integrity,'' said Terry Knapp, a psychology professor at the
University of Nevada-Las Vegas. ''They aren't concerned about
preserving the money; they're concerned about conserving
integrity.''
</P>
<P>
   The proposals will be sent to the faculty senates at NCAA
Division I universities, the American Association of University
Professors and other academic organizations.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are primarily a faculty group so, therefore, we believe we
should begin reform with ourselves,'' Ericson said.

<HEADLINE> Hurricanes 4, Islanders 1  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID DROSCHAK, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) -- Gary Roberts and Robert Kron scored 1:40
apart in the second period, and Sean Hill had a career-high three
assists as the Carolina Hurricanes beat the New York Islanders 4-1
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The Hurricanes trailed 1-0 despite dominating play. Carolina
rallied late in the second with a power-play goal by Roberts and a
short-handed score by Kron to beat the penalty-plagued Islanders
for the eighth time in nine meetings.
</P>
<P>
   Ron Francis, who became the 13th player in NHL history to play
in 1,400 games, iced it with a power-play goal with 13:40 left as
Carolina remained in the Eastern Conference playoff race.
</P>
<P>
   Roberts added his 20th goal with 3:58 remaining, reaching the
mark for the ninth time in his career.
</P>
<P>
   Carolina outshot the Islanders 49-10 to snap New York's modest
two-game road winning streak. New York, which took 13 penalties,
had a season-low for shots.
</P>
<P>
   A rebound shot by Roberts, his 19th goal, tied it with 5:42 left
in the second. Carolina was 0-for-6 on the power play before
Roberts scored.
</P>
<P>
   Kron and Rod Brind'Amour then broke in 2-on-1 against Kevin
Weekes, seconds after Andrei Kovalenko was penalized for
high-sticking. Kron kept the puck and fired it high over the
Weekes' glove for his 12th and Carolina's third short-handed goal
of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Arturs Irbe preserved Carolina's 2-1 lead with 15:05 left when
he stopped Mike Watt on a short-handed breakaway. Francis made it
3-1 less than two minutes later.
</P>
<P>
   Mariusz Czerkawski was credited with his team-leading 29th goal
6:18 into the second as Brind'Amour accidentally tried to clear
Czerkawski's centering pass and shot it into his own net.
</P>
<P>
   Carolina outshot the Islanders 22-4 in the opening period, but
couldn't get one by Weekes, who allowed eight goals in games
against Pittsburgh and New Jersey last week. The 22 shots were the
most in a first period this season for the Hurricanes.

<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- Chris Pronger scored with 2:01 left in regulation
to lift the St. Louis Blues to a 1-1 tie with the Chicago
Blackhawks on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Pronger spoiled Jocelyn Thibault's shutout bid on a screened
50-foot shot moments after the Blues won a faceoff in the Chicago
zone. His drive from just inside the blue line sailed under
Thibault's outstretched glove.
</P>
<P>
   The Blues, who stretched their unbeaten streak to six (5-0-1),
held the Blackhawks to a team record-tying 11 shots. Chicago also
had just 11 shots in a 3-0 loss to St. Louis on Jan. 21.
</P>
<P>
   Tony Amonte scored his 39th goal of the season for Chicago,
5-1-2 in its last eight.
</P>
<P>
   St. Louis played without leading scorer Pavol Demitra, who
suffered a concussion Friday at Tampa Bay when he was checked from
behind.
</P>
<P>
   The Blues, who have 106 points, were trying to equal their team
record for points in one season, 107, set in 1980-81.
</P>
<P>
   Amonte, set up by Alex Zhamnov's cross-ice pass, beat Jamie
McLennan from the low edge of the left circle 1:49 into the game.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Blues outshot the Blackhawks 18-7 through two
periods, Thibault faced only a handful of difficult chances through
40 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   In the third, however, Thibault was forced to make several tough
stops, including two on a point-blank shot and rebound attempt by
Bob Bassen with 7:55 left.
</P>
<P>
   Despite losing his blocker and stick, Thibault also blocked
close-in shots by Scott Pellerin and Al MacInnis with 5:15
remaining.
</P>
<P>
   In overtime, Thibault faced five shots, including one by
MacInnis in the final seconds. Thibault finished with 35 saves.

<HEADLINE> Petrochina Head Rejects Criticism  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   HONG KONG (AP) -- The chairman of Petrochina Co. on Sunday denied
the company will use proceeds from its stock offering to fund
projects in Sudan and that it has violated human rights in China.
</P>
<P>
   Ma Fucai told reporters in Hong Kong via satellite from San
Francisco that Petrochina has no plans to use the roughly $3
billion expected from its initial public offering for investments
overseas.
</P>
<P>
   ''Petrochina doesn't have any overseas assets or operations and,
in our near term business plan, we do not have any plans to expand
overseas,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Petrochina's parent, China's main state-owned oil and gas
company China National Petroleum Corp., has projects in Sudan,
which is under U.S. sanctions for human rights abuses.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom last
month set up a task force to monitor Petrochina's plans to raise
money on U.S. stock markets to ensure it doesn't transfer funds to
its parent company's Sudan-based projects.
</P>
<P>
   Ma said about 60 percent of the funds raised will be spent on
technology, retailing, exploration and production, and a natural
gas pipeline from west China to where demand is greatest in the
east. The remaining 40 percent will be used to pay off Petrochina's
debts.
</P>
<P>
   Ma also dismissed criticism the company violated human rights in
China.
</P>
<P>
   ''Petrochina and CNPC are commercial entities. In our past and
present business conduct, we have never violated human rights and
we will not in the future,'' Ma said.
</P>
<P>
   Petrochina is offering 175.8 million shares in Hong Kong and in
the United States. Shares will start trading in the United States
on April 6 and in Hong Kong on April 7.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. labor leaders and human rights activists urged investors
not to buy the stock, expressing concerns over labor problems and
human rights abuses in China.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Schapira, managing director at lead underwriter Goldman
Sachs, said the company was pleased with the initial investor
response.
</P>
<P>
   ''The international response has been very good so far,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   He denied reports that the company had to reduce the size of the
offering.
</P>
<P>
   BP Amoco has agreed to buy 20 percent of the shares in
PetroChina's offering, up to a maximum of $1 billion.

   SHELTER COVE, Calif. (AP) -- A Canadian woman drowned and two
teen-agers were missing after they were swept into the Pacific
Ocean while on a high school sightseeing trip.
</P>
<P>
   The woman, believed to be a chaperone, slipped in the surf and
was pulled out to sea Saturday near Shelter Cove, about 200 miles
north of San Francisco, the U.S. Coast Guard said. Four males in
the group jumped in after her, according to spokesman Michael
Burgess.
</P>
<P>
   The Coast Guard recovered the body of the woman, who was in her
40s, and rescued a 17-year-old male and a 37-year-old male. Both
were taken to the Mendocino Coast Hospital where their conditions
were not immediately available.
</P>
<P>
   The Coast Guard continued to search Sunday for the two others,
both 17 years old.
</P>
<P>
   The five people were from a Calgary high school, but their names
were not released.

<HEADLINE> Logistics Hamper Uganda Cult Probe  </HEADLINE>
By CRAIG NELSON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   RUGAZI, Uganda (AP) -- The investigation into the suspicious
deaths of at least 490 members of a Christian doomsday sect was
tangled in logistical confusion Sunday as a leading legislator
speculated that sect leaders were behind the deaths.
</P>
<P>
   Local police guarded a half-open grave at the sect's remote
compound in southwestern Uganda, awaiting the arrival of a
pathologist from the capital of Kampala and investigators from a
nearby town to continue exhuming the burial pit.
</P>
<P>
   But Uganda's chief pathologist never left the capital, police
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Logistics were a problem,'' police spokesman Mugenyi Assuman
said by telephone from Kampala.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a team of investigators standing by for the
pathologist in Rukungiri, 19 miles from the compound, were never
informed of the delay.
</P>
<P>
   Senior Ugandan officials have quoted a 17-year-old sect member
as saying the sect's two top leaders -- Cledonia Mwerinde, 40, and
Joseph Kibweteere, 68 -- may have fled the area March 17, when a
fire in a sect church killed 330 members. Those reports are
unconfirmed.
</P>
<P>
   The deaths in the village of Kanungu were initially viewed as a
mass suicide. However, officials, police and villagers have
speculated that the two leaders fled as the sect grew increasingly
divided over the fact that the world did not end Dec. 31 as was
predicted and wanted back their belongings, which they had
surrendered on joining the sect.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Muhezi, a leading member of parliament and a onetime head of
Uganda's internal security agency, theorized Saturday that sect
leaders cracked down viciously on the defiant, poisoning some, and
urging the mass suicide to curb further defections.
</P>
<P>
   Muhezi had also criticized the investigation into the deaths of
hundreds of members of the Movement for the Restoration of the Ten
Commandments.
</P>
<P>
   Asked by reporters why 153 bodies in a sect compound in nearby
Buhunga were exhumed and hastily reburied Friday without being
identified, Muhezi replied: ''You're guess is as good as mine. It's
a poor investigative job.''
</P>
<P>
   Authorities in this East African nation say their probe has been
hampered by lack of equipment, vehicles and staff.
</P>
<P>
   The initial belief that the deaths at Kanungu were mass suicide,
a senseless tragedy, soon turned sinister when the crumpled bodies
of what they said were six murdered men were discovered crammed in
one of the compound's latrines. Within days, 153 bodies were found
in the dirt floors of a sect compound in Buhunga, some 13 miles
away.
</P>
<P>
   The sect had up to 1,000 members, and authorities here fear most
may have become victims. Government officials are treating movement
leader Kibwetere as a fugitive and the all the deaths as murder.
</P>
<P>
   While they waited for experts to arrive Sunday, local
authorities in Rugazi, 36 miles from Buhunga, surveyed a small
sugar cane field adjoining the compound, mapping the tentative
boundaries of an excavation for more bodies. At the corner of the
field was the half-open grave, only an arm and hip jutting from the
brown earth.
</P>
<P>
   Police discovered the grave Friday, when they came to inspect
the compound that until recently belonged to Dominic Kataribabo,
who became a leader in the sect soon after a local bishop stripped
him of his duties as Roman Catholic priest in the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   To sect followers who flocked to the three-building compound and
its stunning view of nearby Lake Edward, Kataribabo preached the
movement's apocalyptic message and criticized Roman Catholic
officials for failing to live up to their public teachings.

<HEADLINE> Torre Sees Subway Series as Madness  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT MYERS, Fla. (AP) -- When asked what a New York subway series
would be like, Yankees manager Joe Torre needed just one word --
madness.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm sure (Mets manager) Bobby (Valentine) feels the same
way,'' Torre said Sunday before the Yankees played the Minnesota
Twins. ''It's just madness. Right now when you go to postseason
play, the madness is at the ballpark. That would be madness from
when you open your eyes in the morning until you close them at
night.''
</P>
<P>
   New York has not hosted a subway series since the Yankees --
managed by Casey Stengel -- beat the Brooklyn Dodgers in seven games
in 1956.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think it would be great for the fans,'' Torre said. ''It
would be a great experience for all of us if we happened to be a
part of it. It's something that while you're going through it,
you'd probably hate it. When it was over with, you'd be happy it
happened.''
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees have won seven of the 12 interleague meetings
between the teams over the past three seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ''The only time it would live up to what it's suppose to be is
if you play postseason,'' Torre said. ''I said no last year (if he
wanted to face the Mets in the World Series), but if it's the only
way the Yankees can get into the World Series, sure.''

<HEADLINE> Attorney in air rage case says witness was discouraged fromtestifying  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEWARK, N.J. (AP) -- The attorney for a man charged with
attacking a Continental Airlines gate agent has accused prosecutors
of misconduct, saying a witness who offered a different account of
the dispute between the men was not called to testify.
</P>
<P>
   John Davis Jr., 30, was indicted in November 1999 by an Essex
County grand jury on a charge of aggravated assault for allegedly
attacking gate agent Angelo Sottile.
</P>
<P>
   Sottile, 50, of New York, suffered two broken vertebrae in his
neck and a fractured skull.
</P>
<P>
   The gate agent's coworkers blamed Davis for attacking him in an
unprovoked moment of ''air rage.'' Davis, of Fredericksburg, Va.,
has claimed he was protecting himself.
</P>
<P>
   The police report cited witnesses who said Davis struck Sottile
before throwing him onto the floor, but one witness with no
connection to either the airline or Davis has painted a different
picture of the incident.
</P>
<P>
   Hillside Councilwoman Patricia Stotzer said Sottile was choking
Davis before the gate agent crashed to the ground, according to
Sunday's editions of The Star-Ledger of Newark.
</P>
<P>
   As Davis nears trial for aggravated assault charges in state
Superior Court in Newark, a dispute has arisen over why Stotzer was
not extensively interviewed by investigators or called before the
grand jury.
</P>
<P>
   Anthony J. Pope Jr., Davis' attorney, has asked state Superior
Court Judge Harold W. Fullilove to dismiss the indictment based on
what Pope alleges is misconduct on the part of the Essex County
Prosecutor's Office.
</P>
<P>
   Fullilove is scheduled to hold a second hearing on the motion on
Tuesday, and Stotzer is expected to testify.
</P>
<P>
   In court papers, Pope stated the prosecutor's office failed to
subpoena Stotzer to testify before the grand jury last fall. Pope
said a prosecutor's investigator, Edward Schneider, told Stotzer
that her testimony was not necessary.
</P>
<P>
   Schneider, who took a short statement from Stotzer at her home,
misled the grand jury by telling them that no witnesses offered
contradictory versions of the incident, Pope said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The facts reveal a horrid picture of intentional prosecutorial
misconduct,'' stated Pope in court papers.
</P>
<P>
   Assistant Prosecutor Leslie Mann responded in papers claiming
that Stotzer was never told that her testimony was not necessary.
Stotzer was invited to testify on Nov. 3, but failed to appear,
Mann said.
</P>
<P>
   Schneider's statement to the grand jury was not untruthful
because, Mann said, Stotzer's account was vague enough that it
could be construed as not contradicting the other witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   Stotzer told the newspaper that Schneider said she did not have
to testify.
</P>
<P>
   ''If I was subpoenaed, of course I would have went,'' Stotzer
said. ''I mean, no one would go if they weren't subpoenaed.''
</P>
<P>
   In July, Davis and 10 others, including his in-laws and five
children, were about to board a flight to Orlando, Fla., en route
to a Disney World vacation, according to Pope.
</P>
<P>
   Accounts differ as to what happened during the altercation.
</P>
<P>
   Police have said Sottile tried to stop Davis' wife from
following her daughter, who had run ahead on the jetway. Davis then
grabbed Sottile and slammed him headfirst into the floor, police
said.
</P>
<P>
   Davis and his family said Sottile was belligerent, pushed Davis'
wife as she tried to enter the jetway and then put his hands around
Davis' neck when he came to his wife's aid.
</P>
<P>
   Davis has filed a lawsuit against Continental Airlines, charging
that the Houston-based carrier's poor training caused employees to
be hostile to travelers.
</P>
<P>
   If convicted, Davis could face up to 10 years in prison.

<HEADLINE> Attorney Generals Mull Tobacco Cases  </HEADLINE>
By The Associated Press	   State attorneys general have hired lawyers in case
major
cigarette makers file for bankruptcy in the wake of multibillion
dollar settlements with states.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The National Association of Attorneys General said Friday it
retained a Los Angeles bankruptcy law firm to ensure states receive
a combined $246 billion in tobacco settlements.
</P>
<P>
   ''Given the complexity and duration of the tobacco settlement,
it is rational to anticipate the possibility of a bankruptcy filing
or filings at some point,'' North Dakota Attorney General Heidi
Heitkamp said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Under a massive deal forged in 1998, big tobacco companies must
shell out $206 billion to 46 states over 25 years. Four remaining
states -- Mississippi, Florida, Texas and Minnesota -- settled
separately for an additional $40 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The nation's five biggest cigarette makers owe about $10 billion
this year.
</P>
<P>
   They also face a potentially record-setting punitive damages
award in a Miami smoker's trial wrapping up next week. The tobacco
industry fears an estimated 500,000 sick Florida smokers may be
awarded $300 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've retained bankruptcy counsel to make sure that we are
protected and that we can continue to hold the industry's feet to
the fire to make sure they live up to the terms of the settlement
agreement,'' said Brian Smith, spokesman for Washington Attorney
General Christine Gregoire.
</P>
<P>
   The association retained the firm of Pachulski, Stang, Ziehl,
Young &AMP; Jones.

<HEADLINE> Violence Shadows NFL at Meetings  </HEADLINE>
By DAVE GOLDBERG, AP Football Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   PALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- No one in the NFL questions that the
league's image has been damaged by off-field violence. But as the
league begins its annual meeting Monday, few executives know what
to do about it.
</P>
<P>
   ''You can't legislate good behavior anywhere in society,'' Bill
Polian, president of the Indianapolis Colts, said Sunday. ''What
you can do is penalize bad behavior.''
</P>
<P>
   Along with the annual discussion of instant replay, the owners,
general managers, coaches and other club officials will spend part
of this week dealing with a troublesome and persistent problem --
acts of violence by NFL players.
</P>
<P>
   The most serious cases are murder charges against Ray Lewis of
Baltimore and Rae Carruth, formerly of Carolina. But there have
been a number of other episodes, leading commissioner Paul
Tagliabue for the first time to suspend players for off-field
violence.
</P>
<P>
   Matt O'Dwyer of Cincinnati and Jumbo Elliott, the now-retired
Jets' tackle, were involved in a bar brawl for which Jason Fabini,
another Jet, was fined. Denard Walker of Tennessee pleaded guilty
to charges of assaulting the mother of his son. Like O'Dwyer and
Elliott -- if he were to play -- Walker was suspended for the first
two games of next season.
</P>
<P>
   While there probably will not be major action at the meetings
regarding violence, there will be a closed discussion Wednesday for
coaches and owners. The panelists will be coaches Brian Billick of
Baltimore, Mike Holmgren of Seattle and Tony Dungy of Tampa Bay
along with three of their assistants.
</P>
<P>
   The other major item at the meetings, as always, will be instant
replay, which is expected to be reinstituted next season.
</P>
<P>
   Since the end of the 1999 season, the first with replay since
1991, complaints about replay abated. Those complaints, several
league officials said, were immediate, emotional reactions by a
team that lost a game as a result of a replay.
</P>
<P>
   Last season, after a 1998 season with numerous officiating
gaffes, replay was approved by a vote of 28-3, with Cincinnati, the
New York Jets and Arizona dissenting.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-four votes are needed for approval, meaning five teams
have to switch, something considered highly unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   There also will be talk about a new scheduling format for the
2002 season, with the arrival of the new Houston franchise.
</P>
<P>
   The league will switch to eight four-team divisions then. But
realignment, always difficult, will not be discussed this week.

<HEADLINE> U.N.'s Iraq Liaison Bids Farewell  </HEADLINE>
By DONNA BRYSON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) -- The outgoing head of the U.N. humanitarian
program in Iraq on Sunday said his criticism of sanctions against
the country was not an attempt to whitewash the regime of Iraqi
leader Saddam Hussein.
</P>
<P>
   Hans Von Sponeck, who has frequently spoken out against
international sanctions on Iraq, said that on Sunday he and Saddam
had ''a very philosophical discussion about the tragedy of his
people.''
</P>
<P>
   ''The comprehensive sanctions as practiced against Iraq have
failed,'' Von Sponeck said.
</P>
<P>
   The official Iraqi News Agency said Saddam told Von Sponeck
''your stand expresses a lot about the situation.''
</P>
<P>
   But Von Sponeck stressed that while he and the Iraqi government
had come to the same conclusion about the U.N. sanctions, it was
''for different reasons.''
</P>
<P>
   Iraq has tried to capitalize on his resignation, with state
media describing him as an honest and courageous man who refused to
bend to the United States, the main advocate of maintaining
sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm not a useful idiot. I'm not a person who's just following
the Iraqi government line,'' Von Sponeck said.
</P>
<P>
   His very public denunciation of international sanctions ''does
not mean I don't see that there are internal reasons'' for the
situation in Iraq, Von Sponeck said.
</P>
<P>
   Von Sponeck said Saddam had welcomed him back to Iraq anytime.
''The president said I don't need a visa anymore,'' Von Sponeck
told The Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   Von Sponeck is due to leave Iraq on Wednesday because he is
stepping down as chief coordinator of U.N. aid programs in Iraq.
The German announced his resignation last month in protest at the
devastating effects of the U.N. sanctions imposed since Iraq
invaded Kuwait in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Von Sponeck has also criticized the oil-for-food program, which
he said does not meet the most basic needs of Iraq's 22 million
people. He was responsible for administering the $10.5 billion
program, which allows Iraq to sell oil and use the revenues for
humanitarian goods to ease civilian suffering that has resulted
from the sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   Increasingly, aid workers, politicians and others have
questioned whether the cost of the sanctions -- deprivation for
millions of ordinary Iraqis -- is worth the goal of forcing the
Iraqi government to surrender its weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
   The sweeping trade, travel and cultural sanctions must remain in
place until Iraq persuades U.N. weapons inspectors it has destroyed
its nuclear, chemical and biological weapons and the ability to
produce and deliver them. But there have been no U.N. inspectors in
Iraq for more than a year, and attempts to restart checks have
stalled.
</P>
<P>
   Days after Von Sponeck announced his resignation, the head of
the U.N. World Food Program in Iraq also quit in protest against
the sanctions.

<HEADLINE> Fighting Rages in South Lebanon  </HEADLINE>
By HUSSEIN DAKROUB, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) -- Israeli troops and allied militiamen
battled Lebanese guerrillas late Sunday as President Clinton met
Syrian President Hafez Assad in Geneva, Lebanese security officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   Officials of the pro-Israeli South Lebanon Army militia said
they detected guerrillas infiltrating the Israeli-occupied zone and
opened fire with tank cannon and long-range artillery. Eight
guerrillas were killed or wounded in the ensuing battle in Wadi
Sluki, a valley north of the occupied zone, they said.
</P>
<P>
   Lebanese officials said there was heavy fighting, but they could
give no details.
</P>
<P>
   The fighting took place as Clinton and Assad failed during three
hours of face-to-face talks Sunday to nail down an agreement to
restart negotiations between Israel and Syria.
</P>
<P>
   Syria is the dominant power in Lebanon and maintains some 30,000
troops in the country.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Sunday, Iranian-backed Hezbollah guerillas fired at five
positions in the Israeli-occupied zone, while Israeli shells
damaged seven houses in the market town of Nabatiyeh, Lebanese
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Israel has promised to withdraw from Lebanon by July.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Ehud Barak told his Cabinet on Sunday that a
unilateral withdrawal would cost Israel $64 million for all the
additional security that would be required, an official said on
condition of anonymity. A withdrawal with Syrian and Lebanese
compliance would cost $24 million, Barak said.
</P>
<P>
   Israel has occupied a strip of south Lebanon since 1982 as a
buffer against cross-border attacks.
</P>
<P>
   Syria opposes a unilateral Israeli withdrawal because it needs
the Lebanon card to pressure Israel into making a prior commitment
to withdraw from the Golan Heights, captured in the 1967 Middle
East war.

<HEADLINE> Muslims Decry Al-Amin Stereotyping  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN ZENOR, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTGOMERY, Ala. (AP) -- When the former black militant Jamil
Abdullah Al-Amin was arrested in rural Alabama, some Muslims say it
only perpetuated an ugly stereotype that Muslims are violent
radicals.
</P>
<P>
   The former Black Panther, who changed his name from H. Rap Brown
upon converting to Islam, is accused of shooting two sheriff's
deputies -- one fatally -- in Atlanta. He was caught last week in
Lowndes County, the same backwoods region of Alabama where he
helped lead a voting rights push in the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's a lot of misconception in the media that all Muslims
are bomb-carrying terrorists, and they get a bad rap,'' said
Richard Penaskovic, an Auburn University professor of philosophy
and religious studies. ''Any religion where people pray five times
a day, my hat's off to them.''
</P>
<P>
   Before his capture, some Muslims complained they were mistreated
as scores of law officers moved through the area, searching for
Al-Amin. Two families -- four adults and two children -- were taken
to Montgomery for questioning and released.
</P>
<P>
   ''People just have a misconception of what Islam means. Islam
only means submission to Christ. I'm not Saddam Hussein and I
didn't bomb anything,'' said Sharif Al-Malik, who says FBI agents
threw him to the ground and threatened his life.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. concerns about terrorism from the Middle East were
heightened after four Islamic militants were convicted in the 1993
World Trade Center bombing. In 1995, When the bomb exploded at the
federal building in Oklahoma City, many jumped to the conclusion
that Middle Eastern terrorists were to blame -- then American
Timothy McVeigh was arrested.
</P>
<P>
   Al-Amin, 56, is charged with murder and aggravated assault and
is being held in Montgomery pending an extradition request from
Georgia. A grand jury would have to indict Al-Amin before Georgia
Gov. Roy Barnes could seek his extradition.
</P>
<P>
   A Fulton County grand jury met Friday and is expected to
reconvene on Tuesday. Fulton County District Attorney spokesman
Eric Friedly declined to say when the grand jury might be expected
to act on Al-Amin's case.
</P>
<P>
   Between 4 million and 6 million Muslims live in the United
States, representing the nation's fastest-growing population
segment, according to the Macdonald Center for the Study of Islam
and Christian-Muslim Relations at Hartford Seminary in Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Bassam Babi, a Syrian-born Muslim and the first pediatrician
in the east Alabama town of Piedmont, said he was concerned about
the response from the community when he started it there about
three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ''I didn't know how well things were going to go,'' said Babi,
whose practice has flourished. ''I was prepared for lots of
obstacles and major things happening. But everyone has been so
great.''

<HEADLINE> Russia's Putin Could Face Runoff  </HEADLINE>
By BARRY RENFREW, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- Vladimir Putin may fall short of outright victory
in Sunday's presidential election and be forced into a runoff after
a surprisingly strong performance by the Communists, according to
early results.
</P>
<P>
   While Putin would almost certainly win a second round, it would
be a humbling setback for the former KGB officer who has become
acting president and the nation's most popular politician with his
calls to restore Russia as a great power.
</P>
<P>
   With about 47 percent of the vote counted, Putin for the first
time was running above the 50-percent barrier needed for outright
victory with 50.01 of the vote, election officials said. Communist
chief Gennady Zyuganov was second with 31 percent, they said.
</P>
<P>
   Political commentators on Russian television networks suggested
Putin could clear the 50-percent hurdle, but the outcome would be
very close.
</P>
<P>
   The state-RTR television network, citing two exit polls,
projected that Putin would get 51 percent of the vote, Zyuganov
would get 28 percent and liberal economist Grigory Yavlinsky would
be third with 7 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Overall turnout was at 65.8 percent, normal for a Russian
election, according to the Interfax news agency. A new election
would have been necessary had the turnout of eligible voters not
reached 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Putin's campaign may have suffered from the widespread
assumption that he would win, convincing many of his supporters
that there was no need to vote. But the fairly strong vote for
Zyuganov was also seen as a protest vote by Russians unhappy about
Putin's apparently inevitable victory.
</P>
<P>
   Putin, looking relaxed, said he was confident of victory as he
voted at a Moscow polling station. He told reporters he was going
to relax at a sauna, saying he expected to face many new challenges
starting Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ''Tomorrow is Monday, a hard day, and I will have to go to
work,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The tough, man-of-action image that Putin cultivates appeals to
many Russians, tired of the uncertainty and mayhem of the final
years of former President Boris Yeltsin. Putin has promised to end
massive corruption, revive the economy after years of recession and
restore the political and military influence that Moscow wielded
before the Soviet collapse.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm tired of all this disorder,'' said Vladimir Prishchev, a
pensioner casting his ballot for Putin in Russia's Pacific port
city of Vladivostok, where graft is rampant and life miserable for
most people. ''When Putin takes charge of something, he takes it to
the end.''
</P>
<P>
   Some Russians, particularly liberals, fear Putin may trample
Russia's fragile democracy and restore the iron control the secret
police enforced during the Soviet era.
</P>
<P>
   ''He is dangerous. He seems too harsh,'' said Anna Polevaya, a
27-year-old architect from Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   But some Russian reformers and Western officials and businessmen
have praised Putin as a pragmatic reformer who will restore
stability in Russia and improve people's lives by making reforms
work.
</P>
<P>
   With a trademark poker face, Putin comes across as stern and
colorless, often cold. He is described often as resembling the
archetypal ''chekist'' or secret policeman -- which appeals to many
Russians who believe tough government alone can clean up the
country and restore stability.
</P>
<P>
   Putin, who makes no secret of his plans to increase the power of
the state and its security forces, insists he is a democrat. But he
has been studiously vague about his plans beyond stressing the need
for strong government and strengthening the security forces.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts say Putin has few specific plans because of his
rapid rise to power and it may be months before his intentions are
clear. Nor is Putin likely to turn things around quickly after
decades of authoritarianism and economic disintegration, they add.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin, who stunned Russians by resigning six months early and
dubbing Putin as his political heir, said Sunday he was confident
that the younger leader would continue the reforms set in place
after the Soviet collapse.
</P>
<P>
   ''Everybody is waiting for change,'' said Yeltsin after casting
his ballot. ''There will be some changes, but the main thing is the
course of reform must stay, and it will stay. I am convinced of
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Putin, who rose through a series of mostly obscure government
posts in the 1990s and has never held elected office, was appointed
prime minister by Yeltsin in August. He gained immediate popularity
for his vigorous image and his tough handling of the war in
Chechnya. Putin was named acting president when Yeltsin resigned
six months early.
</P>
<P>
   Little is known about Putin and extensive checks by journalists
and others in recent months have produced more questions and few
insights. Unlike many prominent officials, Putin has not been
linked to corruption, boosting his image in the eyes of Russians
who have seen political insiders amass vast fortunes while living
standards for most people plummeted.
</P>
<P>
   The election campaign was lackluster with most Russians
convinced a Putin victory was inevitable. The other candidates
appeared resigned to not winning and there was little in the way of
campaign rallies and trips. State television lavished Putin with
daily coverage, boosting his chances.
</P>
<P>
   The challenge awaiting Russia's next leader is enormous. The
economy is in ruins and market reforms have been discredited by
mismanagement and high-level corruption. Schools and hospitals are
falling apart and millions of people go months without pay. Crime
has flourished.
</P>
<P>
   In another sign of the problems facing Russia's next president,
rebels in Chechnya launched a new attack Sunday despite Moscow's
claims that the insurgents have been defeated.

<HEADLINE> Nuggets 112, Nets 110  </HEADLINE>
By TOM CANAVAN, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) -- Chris Gatling put in an off-balance
rebound with less than a second to play and the Denver Nuggets
rallied from an 18-point fourth-quarter deficit to beat the New
Jersey Nets 112-110 Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Nick Van Exel had 28 points and 12 assists, and the Nuggets hit
six 3-pointers in the final quarter in snapping a four-game losing
streak, and a nine-game skid on the road.
</P>
<P>
   Raef LaFrentz added 22 points and 18 rebounds, James Posey had
21 points and Gatling had 20 in a backup role, with his final two
beating his former teammates.
</P>
<P>
   Keith Van Horn and Johnny Newman each had 20 points for the
Nets, who lost their third straight and fell five games behind
Orlando in the race for the final playoff berth in the Eastern
Conference. The Magic (35-36) beat Miami 94-69 Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The Nets (29-40) tied the game at 110 when Scott Burrell put in
the rebound of a Stephon Marbury's missed drive with 6.5 seconds to
play.
</P>
<P>
   After a timeout, the Nuggets inbounded at midcourt. Gatling took
the pass low on the right wing and drove across the lane, missing a
left-handed hook. George McCloud tipped the rebound from the right
side of the basket to the left and Gatling caught the ball and
banked it in with 0.5 to play.
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey never got a final shot as Keon Clark blocked
Burrell's inbounds pass at midcourt.
</P>
<P>
   The Nets, who trailed by 18 in the first quarter, seemed to have
the game in hand when they outscored Denver 30-17 in the third to
turn a four-point halftime deficit into an 86-77 lead.
</P>
<P>
   A pair of 3-pointers by Burrell helped increase the lead to
99-81 early in the fourth.
</P>
<P>
   The lead was 101-84 after Evan Eschmeyer converted a 3-point
play with 7:07 to go, but Denver, which has struggled with its
shooting and scoring recently, went on a 23-5 run that featured two
3-pointers apiece by Van Exel and Posey and one by McCloud. Posey's
second 3 gave Denver a 107-106 lead with 2:10 to play.
</P>
<P>
   Marbury, who had 16 points and 11 assists, put New Jersey ahead
with two free throws before Gatling converted a three-point play
with 56 seconds left for a 110-108 Denver lead.
</P>
<P>
   Antonio McDyess, Denver's leading scorer with a 19.3 average,
only played 14 minutes because of a sprained left ankle and scored
four points.
</P>
<P>
   The Nuggets came in averaging 79.8 points and just 36 percent
shooting (114-of-318) in losing their last four.
</P>
<P>
Notes: An MRI on Nets starting center Jim McIlvaine disclosed a
bulging disc. He tried to warm up, but did not dress. ... Clark's
first-half blocked shot gave the Nuggets three players (LaFrentz
and McDyess) with at least 100 blocks this season for the first
time in their history. They are the 10th NBA team to do it, the
last being the Nets in 1992-93 with Sam Bowie, Derrick Coleman and
Chris Dudley. ... Denver is 7-28 on the road this season, and
20-122 the past four season. ... The win was also Denver's first in
New Jersey since Feb. 17, 1990. They had lost their last eight at
the Continental Airlines Arena.

<HEADLINE> Swiss Cops Kill Gunman After Spree  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHUR, Switzerland (AP) -- Swiss police sharpshooters killed a
lone gunman who fired wildly off his balcony during a ten-hour
shooting spree that injured two police officers in this mountain
town.
</P>
<P>
   Police found the body of the unidentified 22-year-old Swiss man
after forcing their way into his apartment. A spokeswoman said he
had been killed by police marksmen as he stood on his balcony with
a rifle.
</P>
<P>
   Shooting crimes are rare in Switzerland, even though most Swiss
men possess a weapon as part of their service in the militia army.
</P>
<P>
   Police were first alerted early Sunday morning by locals
reporting that a man had fired several shots at a restaurant on the
outskirts of Chur, a scenic town on the edge of the eastern Swiss
Alps.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities ordered the 12 other residents of the small
apartment complex to stay indoors before finally evacuating them
late in the afternoon. They sealed off the area and stopped local
traffic.
</P>
<P>
   One officer was critically wounded when police tried to storm
the apartment earlier in the standoff and a police dog was killed.
Another policeman was injured when the man rushed out of his
apartment early in the afternoon. Officials said they considered
themselves fortunate to have avoided more casualties.
</P>
<P>
   Police said all attempts at dialogue with the man failed. No
information was immediately available about why the man might have
gone on the shooting rampage.

<HEADLINE> LSU Coach Marvels at UConn  </HEADLINE>
By HANK KURZ Jr., AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   RICHMOND, Va. (AP) -- LSU coach Sue Gunter has seen a lot in 36
years of coaching.
</P>
<P>
   And when she looks toward the Lady Tigers' game against
top-ranked Connecticut in the East Regional final Monday night, she
sounds as much like a member of the Huskies' bandwagon as the
opposing coach.
</P>
<P>
   ''I see absolutely no weaknesses on the team -- none,'' Gunter
said Sunday. ''You almost get caught up in watching how fluid they
are.''
</P>
<P>
   The Lady Tigers (25-6) played Tennessee twice this season,
losing by 36 at home and 32 in Knoxville, Tenn. Gunter watched tape
of the Huskies' 74-67 victory in Knoxville and saw ''perhaps as
good a performance as I have ever seen.''
</P>
<P>
   In LSU's first trip to the final eight in 14 seasons and only
second ever, Gunter doesn't want the game to spoil the experience,
no matter the outcome.
</P>
<P>
   ''I want the kids to go out and hammer and have a good time and
enjoy what they've done,'' she said. ''If things go well for us and
we can stay in the game, hey, we're going to be there. We're not
going there to make an appearance.''
</P>
<P>
   So, coach, how to beat the Huskies?
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't have an answer to that, and I don't feel bad about it
at all,'' she said. ''There's a lot of other coaches that haven't
had the answer either.''
</P>
<P>
   Including a one-point loss to the Lady Vols on Feb. 2,
Connecticut (33-1) has won by an average of 31.6 points, using a
smothering defense kept fresh by waves of new players. And everyone
is eyeing the same prize -- the national championship.
</P>
<P>
   Svetlana Abrosimova, one of two first-team All-Americans in the
Huskies starting lineup, said the memories of a fourth-round loss
to North Carolina State two years ago and a third-round loss to
Iowa State last year remain fresh, too.
</P>
<P>
   ''You're watching SportsCenter and you see the teams that
advanced to the Final Four and you're not and you feel like you
really deserve it because you worked really hard, but you didn't do
it. You didn't make it,'' Abrosimova said.
</P>
<P>
   The Huskies' style often is described as relentless. And Shea
Ralph, the other first-team All-American, said the Lady Tigers can
expect to experience it.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm sure they're coming into this game thinking they're going
to win,'' she said. ''That's what we're going to prepare for. We're
going to go out and play our game and not worry about what they
bring to the table or any of that. We're going to go out and let
them know what we're all about.''
</P>
<P>
   This year, when the Huskies have been ranked No. 1 all season
and are regarded as heavy favorites to add a second championship to
their 1995 trophy, what they need to be about is a championship.
It's clear nothing less will do.
</P>
<P>
   ''At the beginning of the season, everybody talks about the
Final Four,'' coach Geno Auriemma said. ''It's the holy grail. It's
where everybody wants to go.''

<HEADLINE> Report: L.A.'s Prosecutor Switched  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- A prosecutor who urged his superiors to file
conspiracy charges against several police officers was pulled off
the task force investigating corruption days later, the Daily News
of Los Angeles reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   District Attorney Gil Garcetti had denied on a radio talk show
that Deputy District Attorney George Rosenstock sought approval to
indict officers involved in a station-house beating.
</P>
<P>
   But when faced Saturday with confidential memos obtained by the
Daily News, Garcetti's spokeswoman Sandi Gibbons acknowledged
Rosenstock wanted to file the first criminal charges against
officers other than Rafael Perez, the central figure in the Rampart
Division scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Perez turned informant after his arrest in August 1998 when he
was caught stealing eight pounds of cocaine from a police evidence
room. Since then he has given investigators a litany of wrongdoing
in the Rampart station's anti-gang unit, saying fellow officers
repeatedly falsified evidence, framed innocent people and lied
under oath to win convictions.
</P>
<P>
   To date, more than two dozen officers have resigned, been fired,
or been relieved of active duty, and 46 criminal convictions have
been overturned. But no officers other than Perez have been
indicted so far.
</P>
<P>
   Police Chief Bernard Parks and others have criticized Garcetti
for not moving swiftly enough to file charges against crooked
officers. Garcetti, who faces a November run-off election, has said
he won't jeopardize cases by filing them without sufficient
evidence.
</P>
<P>
   Gibbons said top prosecutors were aware of Rosenstock's memos,
but insisted Garcetti never was.
</P>
<P>
   ''There was no reason for them to notify (Garcetti). It was just
a memo, basically a prosecutor's assessment of what needed to be
done,'' Gibbons said.
</P>
<P>
   Gibbons said Sunday that neither she nor Garcetti would comment
further on the memos. No one was at Rosenstock's office Sunday to
comment.
</P>
<P>
   Rosenstock's first memos about filing charges against Rampart
officers are from December, according to the Daily News. By
February, he wrote that he had a solid conspiracy case against
officers involved in the Feb. 26, 1998 beating of Ismael Jimenez.
</P>
<P>
   Within days, Rosenstock was pulled off the task force; he now
handles routine, low-profile cases.

<HEADLINE> Gulf States Brace for Cheaper Oil  </HEADLINE>
By DIANA ELIAS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   KUWAIT (AP) -- With major oil-producing countries poised to
increase their outputs, the challenge to Iran and the Arab
countries in the Gulf would be how to soften the blow of lower
crude prices on their economies.
</P>
<P>
   The 11 member states of the Organization of the Petroleum
Exporting Countries are expected to agree at a meeting in Vienna,
Austria, Monday to lift the production curbs they imposed last
year. If they agree to raise their outputs substantially, as urged
by the United States, the move would lower oil prices, which
earlier this month hit a nine-year high of $34.37 a barrel.
</P>
<P>
   ''The (Gulf) area is really terrified of slipping prices,''
Jassem al-Saadoun, an independent Kuwaiti economist told The
Associated Press. ''The (Gulf states) suffered bitterly when prices
fell to around $10 a barrel'' in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   None of the Gulf countries that rely on oil can afford another
price collapse, with a consequent larger budget deficit and
recession. But some states, such as Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, can
bite the bullet if they have to.
</P>
<P>
   Iran however, whose 62 million population is the largest in the
region, cannot. It needs to create new jobs every year for the
young people that make up more than half of its population. Iran
estimates it loses $1 billion a year for every one-dollar drop in
the price of a barrel.
</P>
<P>
   Tehran has opposed a production hike. Oil Minister Bijan Namdar
Zanganeh on Saturday urged the cartel not to be intimidated by
Washington's ''meaningless'' pressure to raise production.
</P>
<P>
   Zanganeh told state-run Tehran Radio that OPEC producers must
set aside political considerations and make decisions Monday based
on their national and economic interests.
</P>
<P>
   ''The market will operate better without political pressures,''
Zanganeh said, adding that an ''unbalanced increase in production
creates instability and greater fluctuations'' in price.
</P>
<P>
   Iran is a major OPEC producer, second only to Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
   The United Arab Emirates also has accused Washington of
protecting its interests without regard to others.
</P>
<P>
   Al-Saadoun said the challenge for producers was how to plan the
timing and amount of their increases so as to cause the least
damage to their economies.
</P>
<P>
   ''The increase could be put off till the third or fourth
quarters, when the lower-demand summer season is over, or it could
be implemented gradually,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Kuwait's oil minister, Sheikh Saud Nasser al-Sabah, said Sunday
that OPEC is likely to raise its official production by 1.5 million
to 1.7 million barrels of crude a day.
</P>
<P>
   That is less than the 2 million to 2.5 million barrel per day
increase sought by the U.S. and other oil importing countries. They
argue that to budge prices downward, a bigger boost is needed to
counteract increased demand at the start of peak driving season and
the need to rebuild diminished inventories.
</P>
<P>
   When U.S. Energy Secretary Bill Richardson visited Kuwait last
month to lobby for a production increase, he said the price of $10
a barrel was too low and $30 a barrel was too high.
</P>
<P>
   Al-Saadoun believes Washington's ''fair price'' is around $20 a
barrel.
</P>
<P>
   Abdullah al-Shayaji, a political scientist at Kuwait University,
wrote in Saturday's Al-Watan that OPEC members should stand firm on
an ''acceptable and gradual hike that doesn't exceed 1.5 million
barrels a day.''
</P>
<P>
   He said if markets were flooded with oil, leading to a collapse
in prices and an increase in budget deficits, ''Bill Richardson
will not visit to show any support ... and nobody will care about
us.''

<HEADLINE> Bucks 99, Celtics 84   </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MILWAUKEE (AP) -- Ray Allen scored 27 points to lead the
Milwaukee Bucks to a 99-84 victory over the Boston Celtics on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Sam Cassell had 22 points and Glenn Robinson 17 as the Bucks
remained 1{ games behind Orlando, who beat Miami 94-69, for the
final playoff spot in the Eastern Conference.
</P>
<P>
   Antoine Walker had 22 points for the Celtics, who slipped 4{
games behind Orlando. Reserve Eric Williams added 14, and Danny
Fortson had a season-high 17 rebounds for Boston, which lost its
fourth straight.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson's basket capped a 12-1 run midway through the third and
gave the Bucks their biggest lead at 73-54 with 3:23 left in the
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The Bucks couldn't put Boston away, however as Dana Barros hit
two jumpers and the Celtics closed the quarter on a 9-1 run.
</P>
<P>
   With Milwaukee leading 74-63, Allen scored the Bucks' first six
points of the fourth and Cassell added the next six to keep
Milwaukee's lead above 12 points the rest of the way.
</P>
<P>
   Allen, who scored 17 in the first half, gave the Bucks a 49-33
lead with his third 3-pointer and helped Milwaukee build a 53-40
halftime lead.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Vitaly Potapenko was called for a flagrant foul early in
the third when he blocked Darvin Ham's dunk attempt. ... Allen had
all three of the Bucks' steals in the first quarter. ... The
Celtics are 8-28 on the road. ... Each team has 12 games left. Only
two of the Bucks' opponents have a winning record, while the
Celtics have to face six clubs with a .500 or better winning
percentage. ... The Bucks won the three-game season series and
would clinch the tie-breaker should the two team finish tied for
the final playoff spot.

<HEADLINE> Voter Turnout Low in Chechnya  </HEADLINE>
By LYOMA TURPALOV, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   GROZNY, Russia (AP) -- Reports of foul play marred voting in
Russia's presidential election in war-ravaged Chechnya on Sunday,
while Russian jets and artillery shelled rebel positions in the
south of the breakaway republic.
</P>
<P>
   Military officials denied reports that rebels had seized the
mountain town of Nozhai-Yurt in eastern Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   The streets of Chechnya's cities and towns were bare, and only a
small number of voters could be seen at the polls, contrasting with
high turnout reported by election officials.
</P>
<P>
   According to election officials, the turnout was high at around
65 percent. However, tens of thousands of Chechens have been
displaced by the 6-month-old war, and few were expected to make it
to the polls.
</P>
<P>
   One election official openly suggested that the vote results
could be rigged in acting President Vladimir Putin's favor. Putin
was heading toward a first round victory according to early returns
released Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ''In any case, we will have to show Putin with a strong lead in
our protocols,'' said Shirvani Murtazov, the head of the election
commission in the Leninsky district of the Chechen capital, Grozny.
</P>
<P>
   Some Chechens interviewed in refugee camps in neighboring
Ingushetia reported cases of coercion by Russian troops.
</P>
<P>
   ''Soldiers were calling at homes and scaring people, saying they
would rob them of all their belongings if they fail to cast
ballots,'' said Lida Saidova, 42, from the village of Orekhovo in
the western Achkhoi-Martan region.
</P>
<P>
   ''They grabbed me, brought me to a house and ordered to vote,''
said Maka Khanchukayeva, 45, who came from Grozny three days ago.
She said soldiers forced her to vote last week, even though the
vote wasn't supposed to start until Sunday. ''I asked them why
should I vote ... but they told me it's not my business. So I voted
for Putin just as a soldier told me.''
</P>
<P>
   Refugees were invited to temporary polling stations at refugee
camps, but few showed up.
</P>
<P>
   Some 100,000 Russian troops stationed in Chechnya also cast
ballots, and 98 percent of them voted for Putin, the ITAR-Tass news
agency reported.
</P>
<P>
   The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe did not
send election observers to Chechnya because their safety could not
be guaranteed, the head of the OSCE mission in Moscow said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Helle Degn told Interfax that international standards for
elections were not observed in Chechnya and conditions were not
created for foreign observers to travel freely and safely.
</P>
<P>
   Polls weren't set in the Shatoi, Itum-Kale and Vedeno regions in
southern Chechnya where remaining rebel forces were reportedly
based.
</P>
<P>
   Col.-Gen Alexander Baranov, chief of staff for the Russian
troops in Chechnya, said that federal jets and artillery on Sunday
shelled suspected rebel locations near the mountainous town of
Tsentoroi, some 31 miles southeast of Grozny.
</P>
<P>
   He dismissed reports about rebels seizing the town of
Nozhai-Yurt in the same area.
</P>
<P>
   Sergei Yastrzhembsky, the Kremlin spokesman on Chechnya, said
Sunday that Russian troops were carrying out a search for rebels in
the region and said some rebel commanders may be hiding out there.
</P>
<P>
   Interfax, citing the headquarters of the combined federal forces
in the North Caucasus, said earlier Sunday that up to 2,000 rebels
had infiltrated Nozhai-Yurt, about 9 miles northeast of Tsentoroi,
in small groups over the past several days. The rebels reportedly
announced Saturday night that Nozhai-Yurt was under their control.
</P>
<P>
   The military stepped up security throughout Chechnya for
election day, but no serious clashes were reported. Federal forces
on Sunday defused eight powerful landmines set along a highway near
Gudermes in eastern Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Russia's claim to control most of Chechnya, rebels can
still travel around the republic and ambush military posts and
Russian-controlled villages.
</P>
<P>
   Russian ground troops entered Chechnya in late September, after
rebels invaded the neighboring Russian region of Dagestan last
summer. Putin's popularity soared partly because of his strict
position against Chechen rebels, and most of the other 10
candidates also support the war.
</P>
<P>
   Putin said voting in Chechnya demonstrated that the region was
firmly under Russian control. ''The fact that the people of the
republic voted in the presidential election shows that an
overwhelming majority of the Chechen people consider their republic
a part of Russia,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Castro: Elian Will Return to Cuba  </HEADLINE>
By ANITA SNOW, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   HAVANA (AP) -- President Fidel Castro declared Sunday that the
Miami relatives of 6-year-old Elian Gonzalez had lost their battle
to keep the child in the United States and that it was only a
matter of time before the boy was reunited with his father in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Cuban mafia has lost,'' an animated Castro insisted before
hundreds of pro-government university students gathered to press
for the child's return to his communist homeland.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge K. Michael Moore's dismissal on Tuesday of
the family's lawsuit seeking to block Elian's repatriation was
''just and moral,'' Castro said.
</P>
<P>
   In rejecting the request for a political asylum hearing for the
child, Moore ''meticulously reasoned and handed down an
unobjectionable sentence from a judicial point of view,'' the Cuban
leader said. ''From a legal point of view it is invulnerable.''
</P>
<P>
   Castro said the boy should be back in Cuba within three weeks,
depending upon what other legal or political maneuvers the Miami
relatives attempt.
</P>
<P>
   ''Justice will win and so will the Cuban people,'' student Norge
Jimenez declared at the rally, held during a congress of the
pro-government Federation of University Students, known as the FEU.
''Elian will become a member of the FEU!'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Justice Department late Friday told Elian's relatives
in Miami that they have until noon Monday to agree to a speedy
appeal or the boy will be returned rapidly to his father in Cuba,
according to family spokesman Armando Gutierrez.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, a federal official close to the case confirmed
that the Justice Department plans to give the family's lawyers
until April 3 to file the appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Elian has been at the center of an international tug-of-war
since late November, when he was rescued by fishermen who found him
lashed to an innertube bobbing off the Florida coast. Elian's
mother and 10 others perished when their boat sank during the
journey from Cuba to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   In Miami, Elian was turned over to his great-uncle, who is now
fighting for the right to raise him, saying he can give him a
better life off the communist island. But his father and four
grandparents, backed by Castro, have demanded the child's return to
his native country.
</P>
<P>
   For four months, the Miami relatives have successfully blocked
the child's repatriation. In an apparent bid to increase American
support for their battle to keep Elian in the United States, the
Miami relatives last week allowed television journalist Diane
Sawyer to spend two days with the boy.
</P>
<P>
   The ABC News program ''Good Morning America'' plans to air the
first of several reports Monday.
</P>
<P>
   A Spanish-speaking child psychiatrist, with no prior connection
to the case, accompanied Sawyer on the visit, the television
network said.
</P>
<P>
   Additional portions of Sawyer's report will likely be aired on
Tuesday, and on ''20/20'' Wednesday, the network said.

<HEADLINE> Judge OKs Lawsuit Over Matisse Work  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE (AP) -- The Seattle Art Museum can sue a New York art
gallery for the market value of a 1928 Henri Matisse painting that
the museum had to return to its pre-World War II owners, a federal
judge has ruled.
</P>
<P>
   The judge had thrown out the lawsuit last year, ruling that the
museum did not have the right to sue the Knoedler &AMP; Co. gallery on
behalf of the late Prentice Bloedel and his heirs. Bloedel bought
Matisse's ''Odalisque'' from Knoedler in 1954 and gave the painting
to the museum in the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Robert Lasnik changed his mind last week after the museum
showed the Bloedels' had transferred their legal claims on the
painting to the museum.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the museum had to return the painting to heirs of
Paul Rosenberg, a French Jewish art dealer from whom Nazis stole
the painting during World War II.
</P>
<P>
   The heirs sold it for an undisclosed price to Las Vegas casino
mogul Steve Wynn. The painting is estimated to be worth $2 million.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle Art Museum spokeswoman Linda Williams said a trial date
likely would be set in coming weeks.

<HEADLINE> Groups Urge Andro Abstinence  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SARASOTA, Fla. (AP) -- Blue Cross and Blue Shield and the Boys
and Girls Club of America challenged baseball players on Sunday to
abstain from using performance enhancing steroids and
androstenedione.
</P>
<P>
   ''Players have a responsibility to our young fans to set the
right example,'' said Allan Korn, the chief medical officer of Blue
Cross and Blue Shield.
</P>
<P>
   ''All the evidence indicates that these substances can be
harmful to our bodies. Kids need to start hearing from their sports
heroes that there is no substitute for hard work and dedication.''
</P>
<P>
   The two organizations sent letters to major league baseball, the
players' association and a selected list of players to pledge to
stop taking steroids or andro.
</P>
<P>
   ''It remains a priority of major league baseball to deal
effectively with the issues surrounding the use of steroids,
androstenedione and similar substances,'' commissioner Bud Selig
wrote in response to the letter. ''Under applicable legal
restrictions, however, we must deal with those issues in the
collective bargaining process.''
</P>
<P>
   A baseball-financed study by two Harvard researchers released in
February said andro, an over-the-counter dietary supplement Mark
McGwire took in 1998, raises testosterone above normal levels and
could be hazardous.
</P>
<P>
   However, the doctors said additional research is needed to
determine whether andro enhances athletic performance.
</P>
<P>
   Andro is banned by the Olympics, the NCAA, the NFL and the men's
and women's tennis tours, but not by major league baseball, the NBA
or NHL.
</P>
<P>
   Baseball prohibits only illegal substances, and players are
tested only if they have had substance-abuse problems.
</P>
<P>
   Andro sales increased dramatically in 1998, the year McGwire hit
a record 70 home runs. He said last season he stopped using andro
because he didn't want to encourage young people to use it.

<HEADLINE> Protests in U.S. Sector of Kosovo  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Hundreds of ethnic Albanians
gathered at three separate spots near the main U.S. Army base in
Kosovo on Sunday to protest the release of a suspect on murder and
weapons smuggling charges.
</P>
<P>
   The protests over the release of Xhavit Hasani took place along
Kosovo's border with Macedonia, in the town of Urosevac and near
the town of Kacanik, said U.S. Army Sgt. First Class Ian
Fitzgerald.
</P>
<P>
   The protest near the Djeneral Jankovic border crossing point
began about at nightfall. Military police from the United States
and troops from Greece and Poland converged at the protest sites.
</P>
<P>
   The demonstrators objected to the release of Hasani, an ethnic
Albanian from Vitina who was transferred by NATO peacekeepers to
the custody of U.N. police on Saturday. Police intended to
extradite him to Macedonia to face murder charges, though it is
unclear whether he was actually sent to Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
   No injuries were reported.
</P>
<P>
   Ethnic Albanians in Vitina have complained that American
soldiers have harassed them, beating some suspected of violence and
subjecting women to inappropriate body searches. The allegations
have prompted an official Army investigation and threaten a
breakdown in trust between the U.S. peacekeepers and the citizens
they were sent to protect.

<HEADLINE> Sutton Ahead At Players Championship  </HEADLINE>
By DOUG FERGUSON, AP Golf Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   PONTE VEDRA BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- Hal Sutton got the challenge he
wanted and played the way he expected. The only thing that stopped
him from winning his showdown against Tiger Woods in The Players
Championship on Sunday was the weather.
</P>
<P>
   Sutton was nearly flawless for 11 holes in building a
three-stroke lead over Woods when thunderstorms drenched the TPC at
Sawgrass and suspended the final round until Monday. Play will
resume at 9 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   ''Obviously, I'd have liked to keep playing,'' Sutton said.
</P>
<P>
   No wonder. Sutton didn't miss any fairways and only one green,
and that followed a bunker shot that he ranks among the best of his
career to save par.
</P>
<P>
   Woods failed to birdie three par 5s, twice had to get
up-and-down for bogey and bolted off the course when the siren
sounded.
</P>
<P>
   When play resumes, Woods will have a 40-foot birdie putt on the
12th, while Sutton has 82 yards left for his second shot from --
where else? -- the fairway.
</P>
<P>
   ''Things aren't going exactly the way I wanted,'' Woods said
with a smile.
</P>
<P>
   But he wasn't exactly counting himself out. Remember, his record
is 1-0 in Monday finishes, having stormed from seven strokes behind
with seven holes to play last month to win at Pebble Beach.
</P>
<P>
   And no lead is safe as long as the island-green 17th is still to
be played.
</P>
<P>
   ''Three shots back is nothing on a golf course with the trouble
that's out there,'' Woods said. ''If there's any golf course you
want to play when you're behind, it's one like this.''
</P>
<P>
   Sutton also has a little history on his side. He won The Players
Championship in 1983, the last time weather forced a Monday finish.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was thinking about that up in the locker room,'' he said.
''I don't know if that has anything to do with anything, but it was
nice to think about.''
</P>
<P>
   What matters more is his play, and he had few complaints after
an abbreviated day that featured rock-steady play by Sutton and
several blown opportunities by both players.
</P>
<P>
   From the first cut of rough after a 3-wood that traveled 323
yards, Woods hit a wedge into 10 feet for birdie on the first hole
to tie Sutton at 9 under.
</P>
<P>
   That turned out to be the only birdie on the front nine.
</P>
<P>
   After Woods missed a 6-foot birdie putt on the par-5 second hole
that would have given him the lead, he had to chip for par from the
fringe on the next two holes because of a bad lie in the bunker on
No. 3 and a chunked chip out of the ankle-deep rough on the fourth.
</P>
<P>
   He bogeyed both, and was lucky to be only two strokes down.
</P>
<P>
   While Sutton was everything he promised to be -- fairways and
greens -- he couldn't get a putt to fall. His 6-footer on the first
hole was halfway in before it lipped out. He missed from 12 feet on
No. 12, from 10 feet on No. 3 and from 6 feet on No. 4.
</P>
<P>
   Rarely can one miss so many opportunities without it coming back
to cost him later. But Sutton didn't flinch, and Woods failed to
apply pressure by missing birdie putts of 15 feet or less on the
next five holes.
</P>
<P>
   ''I stayed in my game plan,'' Sutton said.
</P>
<P>
   His putter didn't desert him the entire day. On two occasions,
when it seemed as though Woods was poised to cut into the lead,
Sutton responded with huge putts and that strong, uppercut fist
pump that was such a common sight during the Ryder Cup.
</P>
<P>
   His feet awkwardly planted in the shaggy grass above the ball,
he blasted out of the bunker on the par-3 eighth to 10 feet and
saved his par. It was the first green he missed, and the first key
putt he made.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was thinking this could be big, really turnaround one way or
the other,'' Sutton said. ''I made sure I stayed in the shot and
just flushed it. I couldn't have dreamed it any closer than that.''
</P>
<P>
   Then on the 11th, Woods hit a delicate bump-and-run up the slope
to 6 feet, while Sutton's chip from the rough rolled back down the
hill to 30 feet. Sutton sank the putt, and Woods pulled his to the
left for a three-stroke lead.
</P>
<P>
   Nick Price had a 5-under 67 and was in the clubhouse at 4-under
284. He was tied with Colin Montgomerie, Jeff Maggert, Lee Janzen
and Tom Lehman, who were still on the course.
</P>
<P>
   Tournament officials said they were confident that, despite the
rain, the greens would be at the same speed when play resumes
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The final seven holes almost certainly will come down to Sutton
and Woods, which is exactly what both of them wanted. For Sutton,
it's a chance to prove he can tame the No. 1 player in the world.
For Woods, it's simply another chance to win.
</P>
<P>
   The final round will be televised by NBC.

   Last year, Pepper ran away from the field, setting a 72-hole
record with a 19-under 269 total that beat Meg Mallon by six
strokes.
</P>
<P>
   This year, it was Webb's turn.
</P>
<P>
   The Australian led wire-to-wire and finished at 14-under 274.
She has finished either first or second in seven consecutive LPGA
events, dating to the AFLAC Champions last October. She has four
wins and three seconds in those events.
</P>
<P>
   The highlight of Webb's round came on the par-3 5th hole, which
she aced using a 6-iron from 170 yards. The ball bounced once on
the green and Webb looked away to get her tee out of the ground,
then she jumped in joy as it rolled into the hole. At the green,
Webb plucked the ball out of the hole, kissed it and tossed into
the cheering crowd.
</P>
<P>
   Pepper, bothered by back spasms after she slipped on wet grass
at the practice range Saturday, never made a serious run. She shot
par-72 for the third straight day to finish at 4-under 284, one
shot ahead of Meg Mallon.
</P>
<P>
   Cathy Johnston-Forbes and Michelle Redman tied for fourth at
2-under 286. Helen Dobson and Chris Johnson tied for sixth at
1-under 287.
</P>
<P>
   Aree Wongluekiet, the 13-year-old Thai sensation, wound up tied
for 10th at 1-over 289 after a 75 that included a two-stroke
penalty on the 14th hole.
</P>
<P>
   She was penalized for playing her ball from the wrong position
when it moved one-eighth of an inch after she addressed it. The
error was noticed by ABC-TV.
</P>
<P>
   Webb continued a Nabisco tradition by jumping in the murky water
at the 18th green, with a friendly shove from Pepper. Webb jumped
in feet first, followed by her caddie. Singer Celine Dion waded in
to shake hands with both of them.
</P>
<P>
Divots: Webb earned two points for the win, giving her 25 points
toward the 27 required to qualify for the LPGA Hall of Fame.
However, she must wait until 2006, when she completes 10 years as
an LPGA member to be inducted. Annika Sorenstam is in a similar
situation. She earned her 27th point by winning in Tucson, Ariz.,
on March 12, but has to wait until 2003 for induction. ... Trish
Johnson was disqualified after failing to sign her scorecard. Her
final round 73 would have put her at 294, a tie for 31st. ...
Annika Sorenstam was never a factor all week. She finished at
4-over 292, along with two-time Nabisco champion Juli Inkster. ...
Webb has a chance to win as much as $2.5 million as part of the new
Nabisco Grand Slam Challenge. If she wins another major
championship this season, she'll earn a $250,000 bonus. A third
major would be worth $1 million,and a sweep of all four LPGA majors
is worth $2.5 million. ... The tour takes a two-week break and
resumes April 13 at the Longs Drugs Challenge near Sacramento,
Calif.

Putin Appears Headed for Victory
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- Vladimir Putin appeared headed for a narrow victory Monday in
Russia's presidential election, while Communist chief Gennady Zyuganov, in
second place, accused the government of falsifying the results. A surprisingly
strong showing by the Communists threatened to force Putin into a runoff vote.
While Putin would almost certainly win a second round, it would have been a
humbling setback for the former KGB officer. With 59 percent of the vote from
Sunday's election counted by early Monday, Putin had 50.67 percent of the vote,
just enough to ensure outright victory and avoid a second round against the next
highest vote winner. Zyuganov was second with 30.51 percent. Zyuganov said the
Communist vote was more than 40 percent.

   GROZNY, Russia (AP) -- Reports of foul play marred voting in Russia's
presidential election in war-ravaged Chechnya on Sunday, while Russian jets and
artillery shelled rebel positions in the south of the breakaway republic.
Military officials denied reports that rebels had seized the mountain town of
Nozhai-Yurt in eastern Chechnya. The streets of Chechnya's cities and towns were
bare, and only a small number of voters could be seen at the polls, contrasting
with high turnout reported by election officials.

Clinton, Assad Fall Short on Talks
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   GENEVA (AP) -- President Clinton and Syrian President Hafez Assad failed to
nail down an agreement Sunday to restart talks between Israel and Syria for a
landmark peace treaty after three hours of face-to-face negotiations. Syrian
presidential spokesman Jubran Kourieh said that during the talks Assad stressed
the importance of Syria's long demand for an Israeli pullback to the country's
1967 borders. White House spokesman Joe Lockhart characterized the meeting
between Clinton and Assad -- their first face-to-face summit in six years-- as
''very useful.'' But at the same time, he said, ''We don't believe it would be

changed his name from H. Rap Brown upon converting to Islam, is accused of
shooting two sheriff's deputies -- one fatally -- in Atlanta. He was caught last
week in Lowndes County, the same backwoods region of Alabama where he helped
lead a voting rights push in the 1960s.

then marched under police escort to the site of the BIO 2000 conference at the

in the ''Biodevastation'' protest challenged biotech industry leaders to a

   AUSTIN, Texas (AP) -- North Carolina, college basketball's least likely
underdog capped its stunning turnaround by beating Tulsa 59-55 today in the
South Regional final to advance to the Final Four for a record-tying 15th time.
Joseph Forte, the first freshman to ever lead North Carolina in scoring, paved

6-4 in the third round in the Ericsson Open. Sampras vomited after cracking a
crosscourt backhand for a clean winner to break Vinciguerra's serve and take a
4-3 lead in the final set. The gutsy performance was reminiscent of Sampras'
victory in the 1996 U.S. Open quarterfinals, when he threw up during a dramatic
fifth-set tiebreaker against Alex Corretja.

<HEADLINE> North Carolina 59, Tulsa 55  </HEADLINE>
By JAIME ARON, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas (AP) -- Well, look at North Carolina now.
</P>
<P>
   The supposedly misguided team that some said didn't even deserve
to be in the NCAA tournament is headed to the Final Four, led by a
coach who suddenly seems like a genius.
</P>
<P>
   College basketball's least likely underdog capped its stunning
turnaround by beating Tulsa 59-55 on Sunday in the South Regional
final to advance to the national semifinals for a record-tying 15th
time.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Forte, the first freshman to ever lead North Carolina in
scoring, paved the way by scoring 10 of his season-high 28 points
during a 14-4 second-half spurt that broke open a tie game, then
sealed the victory by sinking a foul shot with 4.1 seconds left.
</P>
<P>
   ''It took us a while to find each other this season,'' said
senior guard Ed Cota, who has reached his third Final Four in four
years. ''The teams I was on here before knew how to win. This team
found it late, but we couldn't have picked a better time.''
</P>
<P>
   Players piled on each other at midcourt, then Forte emerged with
the game ball and hurled it into the stands. Standing nearby
watching it all with a big smile was coach Bill Guthridge, who is
headed to Kansas for his mother's funeral Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ''Obviously, since we were an eighth seed, this was
unexpected,'' said Guthridge, Dean Smith's longtime top assistant
and hand-picked successor who heard critics calling for his job two
weeks ago. ''But I believed and the team believed and that's why
we're going.''
</P>
<P>
   The Tar Heels (22-13) came into the tournament having lost four
of six. They 7-8 since a mid-January swoon knocked them out of the
poll for the first time in a decade, a dramatic drop for a team
that was No. 2 in late November.
</P>
<P>
   Now North Carolina is riding a season-best four-game winning
streak that includes victories over the South's top seed, Stanford,
and fourth-seeded Tennessee. The Tar Heels join West champion
Wisconsin as the first No. 8 seeds in the Final Four since
Villanova won it all in 1985.
</P>
<P>
   North Carolina will play Florida on Saturday in Indianapolis in
the national semifinals. The Gators beat Oklahoma State 77-65 on
Sunday in the East final in Syracuse, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm proud of the team,'' Guthridge said. ''They've been
through some tough times and they've kept me up. This is a thrill
you never get tired of.''
</P>
<P>
   Tulsa (32-5) didn't go down easily. The tough defense that has
been the Golden Hurricane's trademark kept them in it even when
leading scorer David Shelton and emotional leader Eric Coley were
in foul trouble, then again when they opened the second half
missing eight straight shots.
</P>
<P>
   Even after the Forte-led run put North Carolina up by 10,
never-say-die Tulsa challenged again. Freshman Dante Swanson scored
six straight points in the final two minutes to make it 57-55 with
21 seconds left.
</P>
<P>
   Coley was gone after fouling Cota on the inbounds pass, and he
hit one of two free throws to make it 58-55. Shelton took a wild
3-pointer with eight seconds left that would have tied it, but
missed badly.
</P>
<P>
   ''It wasn't drawn up like that,'' said Shelton, whose 1-for-9
outing epitomized Tulsa's poor shooting. ''But they didn't switch
and I just tried to make a play because we didn't have much time.''
</P>
<P>
   Forte grabbed the rebound and was fouled. As the teams walked to
the other end of the court, 7-footer Brendan Haywood held his
massive arms straight up and waved to the crowd. Forte drew more
cheers by making the game's final point.
</P>
<P>
   Tulsa ended the greatest season in its history, having set a
school record for wins and advancing its farthest in 12 NCAA
appearances. The Golden Hurricane's previous four losses had been
by a combined seven points, none by more than three.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a sweet feeling because of all the goals we've met,''
Coley said. ''But sometimes you're going to lose. It's tough as a
senior, but I hope the other guys got a taste of it and will be
back here next year.''
</P>
<P>
   Swanson hit 6-of-8 shots and led Tulsa with 15 points. Marcus
Hill and Brandon Kurtz each scored 11.
</P>
<P>
   North Carolina was much bigger than Tulsa, but the Golden
Hurricane were a lot faster. That balance kept things close.
</P>
<P>
   Tulsa played tight man-to-man defense and often had two guys
defending the ball. Wide-open shots were few and far between for
the Tar Heels, but with patient, good shot selection they made 44
percent.
</P>
<P>
   North Carolina's defense ended up being the difference.
Guthridge switched between man and zone, and was able to prevent
Tulsa from getting into a rhythm. The Golden Hurricane shot a
season-low 37 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ''They were much quicker on us, so we wanted to switch it up
just to throw them off,'' Cota said.
</P>
<P>
   Forte's big boost began with a jumper that made it 41-39. Fellow
freshman Julius Peppers made two free throws with 8:41 left that
put the Tar Heels up for good, Forte scored the next six points for
an eight-point lead with 6:31 left.
</P>
<P>
   ''Once the NCAA tournament started, I was a little nervous for
the first game,'' said Forte, who also has set North Carolina's
freshman scoring record. ''But I've relaxed for the rest of the
games.''
</P>
<P>
   North Carolina has made the Final Four in every decade since the
1940s. The Tar Heels are going for their fifth and the most
improbable title.
</P>
<P>
   The Tar Heels had been a No. 1 or 2 seed in their previous seven
Final Fours. They'd never gotten past the round of 16 with a lower
seed.
</P>
<P>
   According to the NCAA, North Carolina has one more Final Four
appearance than UCLA. The governing body doesn't recognize the
Bruins' 1980 trip, which was revoked as a punishment for rules
violations.

<HEADLINE> Princeton professor takes national stage to show Lincoln'srelevance today  </HEADLINE>
By RALPH SIEGEL, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   PRINCETON, N.J. (AP) -- When Princeton professor James McPherson
steps into a spotlight Monday night to discuss Abraham Lincoln at
the elegant Kennedy Center in Washington, it will be an auspicious
occasion for him, for his university and for his home state.
</P>
<P>
   All of which he downplays with a friendly and instinctive sense
of modesty. ''It is an honor, yes -- or so they tell me.''
</P>
<P>
   McPherson is scheduled to present the annual ''Jefferson
Lecture,'' which the National Endowment for the Humanities regards
as ''the highest honor that the federal government confers on a
humanities scholar.''
</P>
<P>
   Told of this flattery, McPherson shrugs. The glittering venue is
not intimidating. He has lectured at Princeton University and
nationally at various forums and conferences for 38 years. His
books have reached an audience of millions.
</P>
<P>
   The tough part for McPherson is the mission: to bring to this
auditorium full of scholars and VIPs a contemporary sense of the
mind and soul of Lincoln the man.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is a kind of iconic quality to Lincoln that sometimes
gets in the way of understanding him as a real human being,''
McPherson said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The image of Lincoln is the big Daniel Chester French marble
statue at the Lincoln Memorial. Getting past that sort of marble
man toward the real flesh and blood human being who had to face
real situations is the first step toward appreciating just how
skillful he was, but also appreciating that he made mistakes.''
</P>
<P>
   His lecture, ''For a Vast Future Also,'' tapping a famous
Lincoln phrase, brings an opportunity to impart a message on the
value of history itself.
</P>
<P>
   ''I want them to have a greater understanding of the very theme
that I am talking about, the relationship between the past,
present, future. The way in which history, understanding history,
helps us to understand the world in which we live and helps prepare
us for the world that we are going to continue to live in, the
challenges we are going to continue to encounter on issues of
majority rule, federal-state relations, race relations.''
</P>
<P>
   In selecting McPherson to deliver the first Jefferson Lecture of
the new millennium, the NEH board took a pass on another nominee
for the honor: William Jefferson Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   NEH spokesman Jim Turner said the idea of letting the president
deliver a lecture on his own place in history met with controversy,
''even some hostility,'' because he was not a professional
academic.
</P>
<P>
   The ''millennium'' thing, McPherson said, pressed him into a
useful exercise for all historians:
</P>
<P>
   ''Lincoln himself was very conscious of the relationship between
his present in the 1860s and the past. As he says in the Gettysburg
Address, this war is being fought to determine whether the nation
founded four score and seven years ago will endure or will perish
from the Earth. So there is the connection between past and
present.
</P>
<P>
   ''One of his main messages was that the United States was the
last best hope on Earth for the survival of republican government.
The United States was the only really stable republic, except
Switzerland, in the whole world. Every other country, especially in
the Western world, was ruled by a king, a monarch, a czar, a
dictator of some sort.
</P>
<P>
   ''But he was also very profoundly conscious of its implications
for the future. Will this nation survive into the future? And what
kind of nation will it be? We might not be -- probably would not be
-- one country (but for him). Think for a moment the role the United
States has played in the two major world wars of the 20th century,
and if there were no strong United States in 1941, for example,
what would have happened to the world.''
</P>
<P>
   McPherson has spent his Princeton career teaching students in
formal lecture halls, in his book-lined office, in seminar rooms,
on informal class trips to historic sites.
</P>
<P>
   And he has used his typewriter to teach the nation, publishing
10 books on the Civil War, Reconstruction and the black history of
the era. He has written and edited texts for dozens more essay
collections, art books and volumes of maps.
</P>
<P>
   His crowning achievement is ''Battle Cry of Freedom,'' a lively,
single-volume history of the Civil War aimed at ordinary readers.
The book became a national bestseller and won him the Pulitzer
Prize in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   More recently, McPherson culled thousands of Civil War journals
and letters into ''For Cause and Comrades,'' a richly detailed
examination of what motivated soldiers on both sides to leave their
homes and risk their lives in battle.

<HEADLINE> A Capsule Look at Russia  </HEADLINE>
By The Associated Press	   A look at Russia, which voted for president Sunday:
<TEXT>
<P>
   SIZE: Russia, the world's biggest country, stretches across 11
time zones and has a territory of 6.8 million square miles. It has
89 provinces.
</P>
<P>
   POPULATION: As of the beginning of this year, Russia had a
population of 145.5 million people. Russia's population has been
shrinking sharply since the 1991 Soviet collapse mainly because of
worsening economic conditions, widespread alcoholism, a low birth
rate and bad medical care.
</P>
<P>
   POLITICAL SYSTEM: Russia's president is popularly elected and
has broad powers, including the right to dissolve parliament.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian parliament, called the Federal Assembly, consists of
two chambers. The lower house, the State Duma, is popularly elected
for four years. The upper chamber, called the Federation Council,
is made up of governors and leaders of local legislatures from each
of Russia's 89 regions.
</P>
<P>
   ECONOMY: President Boris Yeltsin launched sweeping free-market
reforms in 1992, setting most prices free and selling off a large
share of government property. The reforms have been discredited by
inefficiency, corruption and cronyism. The August 1998 ruble
collapse was a serious setback to Russia's transition from a
state-controlled to a capitalist economy. High oil prices have
contributed to economic improvement this year, but living standards
remain low. The average monthly wage is about $58 and about half of
the population have incomes considered below the subsistence level.
</P>
<P>
   CAMPAIGN ISSUES -- Corruption that boomed during the Yeltsin
years; the war in Chechnya; restoring Russia's might in world
affairs; reviving the military.

<HEADLINE> Tar Heels' Cota In Third Final Four  </HEADLINE>
By JIM VERTUNO, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas (AP) -- Ed Cota is going to his third Final Four in
four years. This one, however, is different.
</P>
<P>
   North Carolina was supposed to get there the first two times
when the Tar Heels featured Vince Carter and Antawn Jamison.
</P>
<P>
   This year, Cota and the Tar Heels (22-13) fell from grace as a
No. 8 seed and were criticized for even making the tournament after
losing their first game in the ACC tournament.
</P>
<P>
   ''This team is in a class by itself,'' Cota, the North
Carolina's only senior starter, said after the Tar Heels' 59-55
victory over Tulsa on Sunday in the South Regional final.
</P>
<P>
   Haunted by last year's first-round loss to Weber State, Cota and
the Tar Heels took a huge step in erasing the frustration of one
their most difficult regular seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ''It took us a while to get used to each other to find a way to
win and learn how to win,'' he said. ''The teams I was on in the
past, the guys knew what it took to win. This team kind of got it
done late in the season but it couldn't have come at a better time
for us.''
</P>
<P>
   After beating top-seeded Stanford in the second round, Carolina
was still a long shot but Cota was personally feeling pressure to
get one more shot at a national title. ''This is business,'' he
said after the Tar Heels' first practice.
</P>
<P>
   Cota carried North Carolina to a 74-69 victory over Tennessee
when he hit the tying and go-ahead baskets in the final two
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Against Tulsa, the Tar Heels counted on him to control the tempo
against a team that won 25 games this season by double-figure
margins and was accustomed to blowouts.
</P>
<P>
   And at one point it looked like it might cost North Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   The first player in NCAA history with 1,000 points, 1,000
assists and 500 rebounds was just was 2-of-6 shooting Sunday and
committed seven turnovers. Tulsa stripped him of the ball twice in
the final two minutes to cut Carolina's seven-point lead to 55-52.
</P>
<P>
   Cota played all but one minute of North Carolina's four
tournament victories and was wearing down.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was tired at the end. It's kind of hard playing 40 minutes
all the time,'' he said. ''I could have let Joseph (Forte) take it
up, but I wanted to take control.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We never lost faith,'' said Carolina's Kris Lang. ''He's our
floor leader.''
</P>
<P>
   After Tulsa cut it to 57-55 on a 3-pointer, Cota hit one of two
foul shots to give Carolina a critical three point lead with 20.8
seconds left.
</P>
<P>
   A couple minutes after the game was over, Cota's teammates were
still mugging for the television cameras while he hung back,
looking like the pressure was finally off.
</P>
<P>
   During the net-cutting ceremony, he was the last player to snip
the first net and wore it around his neck.
</P>
<P>
   ''I know this means more to Ed than anybody,'' forward Julius
Peppers said. ''When he came in they went to two Final Fours and
then they didn't. He has to feel great right now.''

<HEADLINE> Atlanta Youths Protest Hate Crimes  </HEADLINE>
By PATRICIA M. LaHAY, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA (AP) -- Martin Luther King III, son of the slain civil
rights leader, told about 750 youths gathered at his father's crypt
Sunday that it's time to protect people who are being targeted
because of their race, religion or sexual orientation.
</P>
<P>
   ''Every time that someone's life is lost through hate crimes and
violence, we have got to stand up,'' King said, speaking at the
fountain at the Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial.
</P>
<P>
   King reminded the crowd that young people have been crucial to
every civil rights campaign of the last 50 years -- from the freedom
rides and voting-rights marches of the 1960s to the fall of the
Berlin Wall and demonstrations on China's Tiananmen Square in the
1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds came from across the country and Canada to march the
half-mile from downtown Atlanta to the King memorial. Many spent
the day at ''Stop the Terror,'' an all-day summit dedicated to
preventing hate crimes, which was sponsored by the Atlanta-based
Center for Democratic Renewal.
</P>
<P>
   The march also served as a memorial service for 15 young people
in particular who organizers said had been victims of hate crimes.
Among those memorialized were Matthew Shepard, a 21-year-old gay
University of Wyoming student who died in October 1998 after being
beaten into a coma and tied to a fence, and Amadou Diallo, a
22-year-old African immigrant who was shot to death by four New
York City police officers in February 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The summit and march were part of a four-day event sponsored by
the National Crime Prevention Council and Youth Crime Watch of
America.

<HEADLINE> Va. Sen. Robb Kicks Off Campaign  </HEADLINE>
By BOB LEWIS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANNANDALE, Va. (AP) -- U.S. Sen. Charles Robb, whose 1994 race
against Iran-Contra figure Oliver North was one of that year's most
bitterly contested, kicked off his campaign for a third term Sunday
against a fellow Virginia governor.
</P>
<P>
   The senator warned Republican George Allen that he faces a tough
fight for the only statewide elected office that Republicans do not
control.
</P>
<P>
   Allen has built a sizable lead in fund-raising and started his
campaign months ago, but Robb said he won't ''roll over and play
dead'' for Allen's supporters and wasn't ''frightened by big talk,
big-heeled boots or a big chew of tobacco.''
</P>
<P>
   The plainspoken Allen, like Robb a former governor, is known for
his cowboy boots and often keeps a pinch of smokeless tobacco in
his lower lip.
</P>
<P>
   Allen spokesman Tim Murtaugh said Robb's remarks were sharply
negative and personal.
</P>
<P>
   ''This election is not about boots and chewing tobacco. It's
about taxes,'' Murtaugh said. ''The salient question I ask of Chuck
Robb is what has he been doing for 12 years? If he had a record he
could point to, he would not have to be talking about George
Allen's boots.''
</P>
<P>
   Before about 300 supporters at Northern Virginia Community
College, Robb cited his votes to support increasing the minimum
wage, closing loopholes affecting firearms sales at gun shows and
expanding the Family and Medical Leave Act.
</P>
<P>
   ''With your help and a little luck, maybe after the campaign is
over we can get George a TV talk show in a time slot next to Ollie
North,'' Robb said. North is host of a political talk show on the
cable network MSNBC and a syndicated radio show.

Putin Appears Headed for Victory
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- As Vladimir Putin appeared headed for a narrow victory Monday
in Russia's presidential election, Communist chief Gennady Zyuganov accused the
government of falsifying the election results. With 69 percent of the vote from
Sunday's election counted by early Monday, Putin had 51.17 percent of the vote,
enough to ensure outright victory and avoid a second round against the next
highest vote winner. Zyuganov, second with 30.37 percent, said the Communist
vote was more than 40 percent. A surprisingly strong showing by the Communists
threatened to force Putin into a runoff vote. While Putin would almost certainly
win a second round, it would have been a humbling setback for the former KGB
officer.

Shelling in Chechnya Continues
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   GROZNY, Russia (AP) -- Russian jets and artillery shelled rebel positions in
the south of the breakaway republic in war-ravaged Chechnya on Sunday, while
reports of foul play marred voting in Russia's presidential election. Military
officials denied reports that rebels had seized the mountain town of Nozhai-Yurt
in eastern Chechnya. The streets of Chechnya's cities and towns were bare, and
only a small number of voters could be seen at the polls, contrasting with high
turnout reported by election officials.

Clinton, Assad Fall Short on Talks
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   GENEVA (AP) -- President Clinton and Syrian President Hafez Assad failed to
nail down an agreement Sunday to restart talks between Israel and Syria for a
landmark peace treaty. Syrian presidential spokesman Jubran Kourieh said that
during three hours of face-to-face talks Assad stressed the importance of
Syria's long demand for an Israeli pullback to the country's 1967 borders. White
House spokesman Joe Lockhart characterized the meeting as ''very useful.'' But,
he added, ''we don't believe it would be productive'' for Syrian-Israeli talks
to resume at this point.

Muslims Decry Al-Amin Stereotyping
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   MONTGOMERY, Ala. (AP) -- When the former black militant Jamil Abdullah
Al-Amin was arrested in rural Alabama, some Muslims say it only perpetuated an
ugly stereotype that Muslims are violent radicals. The former Black Panther, who
changed his name from H. Rap Brown upon converting to Islam, is accused of
shooting two sheriff's deputies -- one fatally -- in Atlanta. He was caught last
week in Lowndes County, the same backwoods region of Alabama where he helped
lead a voting rights push in the 1960s.

Sheik Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, will initially be open to UAE citizens
only. ''The base of clients will be expanded in a later stage to include
citizens from the Gulf as well as other nationals,'' said Issa Kazem, director

experienced team, with a 77-65 win Sunday over Oklahoma St. in the East Regional
final. Led by 34-year-old coach Billy Donovan, the Gators will play resurgent
North Carolina, which beat Tulsa 59-55 in the South Regional final, on Saturday

Sampras Advances in Ericsson Open
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   KEY BISCAYNE, Fla. (AP) -- Pete Sampras overcame an upset stomach and an
upset bid by 19-year-old Swede Andreas Vinciguerra today, winning 5-7, 7-6 (3),
6-4 in the third round in the Ericsson Open. Sampras vomited after cracking a
crosscourt backhand for a clean winner to break Vinciguerra's serve and take a
4-3 lead in the final set. The gutsy performance was reminiscent of Sampras'
victory in the 1996 U.S. Open quarterfinals, when he threw up during a dramatic
fifth-set tiebreaker against Alex Corretja.

<HEADLINE> Sunday's Spring Training Roundup  </HEADLINE>
The Associated Press
<TEXT>
<P>
   Big Mac is ready for the season to begin.
</P>
<P>
   Mark McGwire hit two home runs, a rare opposite-field shot to
right and a monstrous drive on Sunday to lead the St. Louis
Cardinals to a 15-11 win over the Cleveland Indians.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire connected for a two-run shot to right field in the first
inning and then led off the sixth with his sixth homer of the
spring, a towering, 465-foot shot to left-center that thrilled a
standing-room only record crowd in Winter Haven, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   ''It doesn't really matter,'' said McGwire who downplays his
March home runs the same way he does the ones he hits in August and
September. ''It doesn't go on your bubble gum card. You just have
to go through the aches and pains and get ready for the season.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of the 9,042 fans arrived early to watch McGwire and the
Cardinals take batting practice, and baseball's home run king
didn't disappoint with some tape-measure shots during BP.
</P>
<P>
   But he saved his best stuff for the game, hitting both homers
off Indians starter Charles Nagy, who also gave up a two-run shot
to J.D. Drew in the sixth.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Sutton and Lou Lucca also homered for the Cardinals, who
scored seven runs in the ninth -- five off projected Indians closer
Paul Shuey -- to blow it open.
</P>
<P>
   Russell Branyan hit a grand slam in the ninth and had five RBIs
for Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   In Fort Myers, Fla., Ed Yarnall whose bid to become New York's
fifth starter has been spiraling downward all spring, allowed four
runs and seven hits in 3 1-3 innings of the Yankees' 12-5 victory
over Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   ''He wasn't very good ... he just seems lost,'' Yankees manager
Joe Torre said. ''He threw his fastball for strikes, but he wasn't
getting anything else over. He's just going to have to fight his
way through it.''
</P>
<P>
   With the Yankees starting the season with a four-man rotation,
Torre said Yarnall will remain in Florida when the team breaks camp
Wednesday for exhibition games in Houston and San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   ''We know it's there, I just think he's put a lot of pressure on
himself from the slow start and he's having trouble right now,''
Torre said. ''It will come, it's just a matter of when it
happens.''
</P>
<P>
   In four appearances after being sidelined by back stiffness,
Yarnall has given up 25 runs and 28 hits in 9 1-3 innings.
</P>
<P>
   ''I wasn't consistent, but it was better,'' Yarnall said.
</P>
<P>
   At Vero Beach, Fla., Gary Sheffield returned from a finger
injury to hit two homers and Carlos Perez allowed no earned runs in
five innings as Los Angeles beat Florida.
</P>
<P>
   After injuring his pinkie sliding into third base on March 17,
Sheffield had planned to wait until the Dodgers' final exhibition
series this weekend in Toronto before returning.
</P>
<P>
   But the stitches came out, and he fixed the wound with super
glue just in time to club a fourth-inning solo home run and a
three-run home run to give the Dodgers the lead in the sixth.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was kind of sore,'' Sheffield said. ''But when you get in
the game, you don't think about it.''
</P>
<P>
   In other games:
</P>
<P>
Tigers 7, Braves 3
</P>
<P>
   At Lakeland, Fla., Tony Clark and Juan Gonzalez homered, and
struggling Brian Moehler pitched six strong innings. Atlanta
starter Tom Glavine gave up nine hits and seven runs in six
innings.
</P>
<P>
Reds 4, Devil Rays 2
</P>
<P>
   At Sarasota, Fla., Steve Parris pitched 7 2-3 innings, showing
he's ready to start the season, and Ken Griffey Jr. had a single
and a sacrifice fly.
</P>
<P>
Royals 7, Blue Jays 3
</P>
<P>
   At Haines City, Fla., Dan Reichert increased his chances to make
the Kansas City staff by throwing three hitless innings. In six
relief outings, Reichert has held opponents to a .185 batting
average and has a 1.84 ERA.
</P>
<P>
Expos 8, Orioles 4
</P>
<P>
   At Jupiter, Fla., Javier Vazquez allowed two runs in five
innings and Peter Bergeron homered as Montreal assure itself of its
best spring record in eight years.
</P>
<P>
Rangers 7, Phillies 6
</P>
<P>
   At Port Charlotte, Fla., Ruben Mateo and Gabe Kapler homered as
Texas beat Philadelphia. Rafael Palmeiro was 2-for-2 with a double
and Ivan Rodriguez also a solo home run for the Rangers.
</P>
<P>
Pirates 5, Red Sox 4
</P>
<P>
   At Fort Myers, Fla., Bruce Aven hit a two-run homer off Ramon
Martinez to lead Pittsburgh.
</P>
<P>
Astros 11, Royals (ss) 10
</P>
<P>
   At Kissimmee, Fla., Jose Lima gave up 14 hits and four home runs
before Houston rallied for the win.
</P>
<P>
Padres (ss) 11, Rockies 7
</P>
<P>
   At Tucson, Ariz., Ryan Klesko hit a pair of three-run homers,
his first two of the spring, and stole two bases to lead San Diego.
Sean Burroughs, the top prospect in San Diego's farm system, added
four hits, including a run-scoring single that broke a 6-6 tie in
the seventh.
</P>
<P>
Giants 14, Athletics 5
</P>
<P>
   At Phoenix, Terrell Lowery had three hits and four RBIs as San
Francisco defeated Oakland. Jay Canizaro, battling for a utility
spot on the Giants' roster, hit his fourth homer of the spring.
</P>
<P>
Angels 14, Padres 11
</P>
<P>
   At Tempe, Ariz., Scott Schoeneweis bid for a spot in Anaheim's
rotation was derailed as the left-hander was pounded for seven runs
in six innings.
</P>
<P>
Diamondbacks 18, Mariners 6
</P>
<P>
   At Peoria, Ariz., Travis Lee was 3-for-5 with four RBIs, while
Luis Gonzalez and Tony Womack each had four hits, as Arizona
pounded six Seattle pitchers for 24 hits.
</P>
<P>
Brewers 8, White Sox 8, 12 innings
</P>
<P>
   At Tucson, Ariz., Milwaukee's Jaime Navarro gave up five runs
and 10 hits in 5 2-3 innings against his former team. Frank Thomas
went 3-for-4 with three RBIs for the White Sox.

<HEADLINE> N. Carolina Coach A Strong Man  </HEADLINE>
By JIM LITKE, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas (AP) -- He never asked for the job. He still
doesn't look the part.
</P>
<P>
   Different?
</P>
<P>
   Put it this way: Not long after North Carolina gave Bill
Guthridge the biggest win of his brief career as a head coach, the
silver-haired, 62-year-old wisp of a man slipped out of the Erwin
Center late Sunday afternoon and headed for Kansas to bury his
mother. Yet when Betty Guthridge died earlier this week at age 96,
her son didn't even tell his ballplayers. They found out the next
day, when reporters began asking around for comment.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's a strong man,'' said Phil Ford, who's been around the Tar
Heels program as a player or assistant coach for 16 years. ''You
have to be a strong man to be the head coach at a place like North
Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   ''Even with his mom's passing,'' Ford added, ''he still put the
program first.''
</P>
<P>
   Anybody who knows anything about Guthridge knew that, even
before the Heels held off Tulsa 59-55 to send him back to the Final
Four for the second time in his three seasons on the job.
</P>
<P>
   As Guthridge stood in a hallway just a few feet from the locker
room celebration, the memories that came flooding back had little
to do with basketball.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think my mother even knew that I was the head coach,''
he said quietly. ''I told her, and my sister did, too. But with
Alzheimer's you never really know if she heard.''
</P>
<P>
   For 30 years, Guthridge sat next to Dean Smith on the Carolina
bench, content to bask in the reflected glow of college
basketball's winningest Division I coach. Then, just weeks before
the 1997-98 season was set to start, Smith stepped down and a
reluctant Guthridge had to be cajoled to step forward.
</P>
<P>
   The journey has taken more than a few twists and turns since: a
Final Four in Guthridge's first season, a first-round knockout by
lowly Weber State in his second and now this, the most improbable,
emotional-fueled run in Carolina's illustrious history.
</P>
<P>
   And it's not over yet. First comes a triumphant return to
Carolina, where postseason success is taken for granted and calls
for Guthridge's firing began with the first-round NCAA tournament
loss last year and ricocheted across Web sites and talk radio every
time this season's team went into a tailspin.
</P>
<P>
   But at the moment when he had every right to blister his
critics, Guthridge apologized instead.
</P>
<P>
   ''I had a lot of faith in this team,'' he said. ''I'm sorry it
took us so long to get going, but it couldn't have come at a better
time.''
</P>
<P>
   Guthridge might have said the same thing about Joseph Forte, who
along with UNC football player Julius Peppers, are the only
significant additions to the team that couldn't climb over Weber
State. The cold-blooded freshman scored a career-high 28 points
against Tulsa, including 10 in a decisive 14-4 second-half run and
a crucial free throw with 4.1 seconds left.
</P>
<P>
   Not that it's going to get him out of the freshmen's traditional
chores at Carolina -- carrying the team's heavy green training bag
back and forth from the bus to the locker room.
</P>
<P>
   ''The fact is,'' Guthridge said, ''we might put some more bricks
in the green bag.''
</P>
<P>
   Fear not for Forte. He can handle a heavier load and then some.
Former Tar Heel star James Worthy was broadcasting the game for CBS
and said he hadn't seen a freshman play with that much poise since
a jug-eared kid named Michael Jordan showed up in Chapel Hill.
</P>
<P>
   You wouldn't know that from listening to Guthridge, though.
Carolina is still run much the same way he and Smith ran it
side-by-side for 30 years. Quietly. No one gets too much credit,
especially the newcomers. No one takes the easy way out. No matter
the situation, the coach sets the example.
</P>
<P>
   Just down the sideline from Guthridge on Sunday, Tulsa coach
Bill Self clapped, screamed, waved and pleaded in the direction of
his ballplayers for much of the game. He is just 37, in his third
year with the Golden Hurricane, still building a resume. A day
earlier, he said his ego wouldn't let him be an assistant for three
decades.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the man who had done just that, stayed in his chair
most of the afternoon. When the tension wound Guthridge's body so
tight that he had to get up, he took a few steps, then stuck his
hands on his hips and tried to look at ease. It worked well enough
on his kids during the game; afterward was another story.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether this trip to the Final Four meant more than the
previous ones, Guthridge tried to recall the years and the teams
Carolina met, but quickly made a mess of the whole thing.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm a little shook up, obviously,'' he said. ''But I'm
thrilled to be going.''

<HEADLINE> U.S. Marines Prepare for War Games  </HEADLINE>
By DANICA KIRKA, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SUVA REKA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Smeared in camouflage grease paint
that turned their features into swirling blobs of green, it was
hard to tell the difference between Lance Cpls. Nick Downey and
Jeremy Diola.
</P>
<P>
   Then there were the matching fatigues decorated with medusa-like
trains of burlap they'll use Monday as the sticky backing for
branches, grass and leaves, creating moveable camouflage blankets
that will help them blend into Kosovo's rugged terrain.
</P>
<P>
   Diola, of Santa Cruz, Calif. and Downey, of Edinboro, Pa., are
among the 1,100 U.S. Marines taking part in NATO war games named
Exercise Dynamic Response 2000. The three-week exercise will give
the two 20-year-olds a chance to roll around in the dirt and test
their professed ability to hit a target from 1,000 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Marine Lt. Col. Tom Rollandini described the exercise as a sort
of scouting mission to help the Marines learn the terrain, to be
better prepared if called in to support the alliance.
</P>
<P>
   Military officials deny that the exercise is a show of force to
Milosevic's forces at a sensitive time, even though it coincides
with the anniversary of the start of NATO's 78-day air campaign to
stop Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic's repression of Kosovo's
ethnic Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   The exercise also features troops from Argentina, Poland, the
Netherlands and Romania.
</P>
<P>
   To kick off the war games, military officials flew reporters to
the NATO's Camp Casablanca, 40 miles south of the capital,
Pristina, to a sort of armored open house, featuring groups of
smiling Marines who stood by their weapons and explained how they
worked.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the Marines seemed more than slightly bemused by all the
attention, fending off the questions even as they tried to explain
that the Kosovo war games were just a multinational practice
session.
</P>
<P>
   The ethnic Albanian population, however, didn't let them forget
that any member of the American military is more than welcome here.
</P>
<P>
   Sgt. Jason Hopper, 22, of Memphis, Tenn. described crowds of
people smiling and waving as troops were driving across the region
on their way to Camp Casablanca -- the only point they are likely to
have contact at all with local civilians.
</P>
<P>
   Though the troops aren't thinking about sending political
messages, they are away of the sensitivity of the war games venue,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''That really doesn't even concern us,'' he said. ''We're just
here to do an exercise. But we understand where we are.''

<HEADLINE> Greece: Turkey Risking EU Backlash  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATHENS, Greece (AP) -- Foreign Minister George Papandreou warned
Sunday that Turkey's decades-long effort to join the European Union
could suffer if a report that Greece's Orthodox church leader had
been banned from entering Turkey is true.
</P>
<P>
   ''If such a document exists, then we will take all the necessary
steps and coordinate our efforts with other European countries,''
Papandreou said. The foreign ministry late Saturday said the
reported ban would ''undermine Turkey's course toward the European
Union.''
</P>
<P>
   Turkish officials have refused to comment on the report Saturday
in Turkey's Sabah newspaper that Archbishop Christodoulos had been
placed on a government ''blacklist'' for actions considered harmful
to the Turkish state.
</P>
<P>
   Seven Greek lawmakers and a retired naval commander were also
named as appearing on the list because of their declared or
apparent support for Kurdish autonomy in southeast Turkey.
</P>
<P>
   The news -- reported while Greeks celebrated a holiday marking
their independence from Ottoman rule -- threatened to cool relations
between the traditional rivals after months of successful efforts
to reduce hostility.
</P>
<P>
   ''There has been a spectacular change in Greek-Turkish relations
over the past year, and this has irritated certain (hard-line)
circles in Turkey and they want to undermine this development,''
Papandreou said.
</P>
<P>
   Christodoulos, known for his outspoken remarks, has often
criticized Turkey and repeatedly referred to the ''unforgettable
lands'' once inhabited by Greeks in Asia Minor.
</P>
<P>
   ''If that is why the door has been closed to me in Turkey, then
they must do the same for all Greeks,'' said Christodoulos, who in
1998 visited the Orthodox Ecumenical Patriarchate in Istanbul.

<HEADLINE> Castro Blasts Elian's Relatives  </HEADLINE>
By ANITA SNOW, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   HAVANA (AP) -- President Fidel Castro said Sunday that the Miami
relatives of 6-year-old Elian Gonzalez and their anti-communist
backers might kill the child or abduct him to a third country
rather than let him return to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   ''They are capable of killing him rather than return him safe
and sound to the country,'' Castro said of Miami's Cuban-American
exiles as he wrapped up a 1{-hour speech. He spoke before more than
700 pro-government university students.
</P>
<P>
   Castro suggested that the exiles could expose the child to a
serious illness in an act of vengeance against Elian's father or
the Cuban government, which have been battling for his
repatriation. He also said that according to ''reliable sources in
Miami,'' the child's ''kidnappers'' had discussed moving the child
to another location or even a third country to prevent his return
to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge K. Michael Moore's dismissal on Tuesday of
the family's lawsuit seeking to block Elian's repatriation was
''just and moral,'' Castro said.
</P>
<P>
   Castro said the boy should be back in Cuba within three weeks,
depending upon what other legal or political maneuvers the Miami
relatives attempt.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Justice Department late Friday told Elian's relatives
in Miami that they have until noon Monday to agree to an expedited
appeal or the boy will be returned rapidly to his father in Cuba,
according to family spokesman Armando Gutierrez.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, a federal official close to the case confirmed
that the Justice Department plans to give the family's lawyers
until April 3 to prepare and file their appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Elian has been at the center of an international tug-of-war
since late November, when he was rescued by fishermen who found him
lashed to an innertube bobbing off the Florida coast. Elian's
mother and 10 others perished when their boat sank during the
journey from Cuba to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   In Miami, Elian was turned over to his great-uncle, who is now
fighting for the right to raise him, saying he can give him a
better life off the communist island. But his father and four
grandparents, backed by Castro, have demanded the child's return to
his native country.
</P>
<P>
   For four months, the Miami relatives have successfully blocked
the child's repatriation. In an apparent bid to increase American
support for their battle to keep Elian in the United States, the
Miami relatives last week allowed television journalist Diane
Sawyer to spend two days with the boy.
</P>
<P>
   The ABC News program ''Good Morning America'' plans to air the
first of several reports Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Castro said that subjecting the child to the interview was
''monstrous and sickening'' and said that sources had told him that
the boy would denounce his father during the airing.
</P>
<P>
   ''You cannot do this without the authorization of the father,''
said Castro, who expressed worries about the child's welfare. ''I
sincerely think that this boy is at risk in the hands of desperate
people and the government of the United States should not be
running this risk,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   A Spanish-speaking child psychiatrist, with no prior connection
to the case, accompanied Sawyer on the visit, the television
network said.
</P>
<P>
   Additional portions of Sawyer's report will likely be aired on
Tuesday, and on ''20/20'' Wednesday, the network said.

<HEADLINE> Japan Stocks Rise in Early Trading  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO (AP) -- Tokyo stocks rose early Monday, buoyed by
anticipation of consolidation at manufacturers and insurers. The
U.S. dollar was lower against the yen.
</P>
<P>
   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average gained 43.20
points, or 0.22 percent, to 20,001.28 points in the first 30
minutes of trading. On Friday, the average closed up 253.48 points,
or 1.29 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The dollar bought 106.78 yen, down 0.56 yen from late Friday in
Tokyo and also below its late New York level of 107.05 yen
overnight.
</P>
<P>
   On the stock market, prices moved higher early Monday in
anticipation of announcements on mergers and business tie-ups among
Japanese companies.
</P>
<P>
   Nippon Paper Industries and Daishowa Paper Manufacturing, both
industry leaders, are expected to announce plans Monday to
integrate operations under a holding company by April 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Also, newspapers report over the weekend said two non-life
insurers, Mitsui Marine and Fire Insurance Co. and Sumitomo Marine
and Fire Insurance Co., will move a planned alliance forward to
October 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Investors were holding onto shares in Mitsubishi Motor Corp.
after national broadcaster NHK reported early Monday that
DaimlerChrysler and Mitsubishi Motors would formally announce a
tie-up agreement in Frankfurt later in the day.
</P>
<P>
   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section was up 10.43 points, or 0.64 percent, to 1,651.03
points. The TOPIX closed down 10.95 points, or 0.66 percent, on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   In currency dealings, the dollar came under selling pressure
from U.S. banks amid a dearth of market-moving news early Monday.
</P>
<P>
   In other currencies, the euro was traded at 104.28 yen, little
changed from its level of 104.27 late Friday in Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   The yield on the benchmark 10-year Japanese government bond was
unquoted in early trading. On Friday, it settled at 1.8700 percent
and its price stood at 100.25.

<HEADLINE> Vote Reveals Communists' Influence  </HEADLINE>
By ANDREW KRAMER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- Communist Party Chief Gennady Zyuganov's
unexpectedly good showing in presidential elections showed off his
party's staying power in Russian politics a decade after the
collapse of the Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   According to incomplete results early Monday, Acting President
Vladimir Putin had 51.51 percent of the vote, compared to
Zyuganov's 30.2 percent. Though Putin had been predicted to win in
the first round Sunday, Zyuganov had not been expected to do so
well.
</P>
<P>
   Even though he hasn't attracted Russia's younger voters,
Zyuganov still has wide support from the elderly, many of whom were
impoverished by Russia's economic reforms and are nostalgic for the
stability of the Soviet era.
</P>
<P>
   He also appeals to rural Russia, where collective farm workers
back his staunch opposition to land privatization and liberal
market reforms.
</P>
<P>
   Zyuganov's core voters were out in full force Sunday,
demonstrating the party's strong discipline.
</P>
<P>
   In comparison, analysts said that many Russian voters who saw
Putin's win as a sure thing didn't cast their ballots.
</P>
<P>
   Though its power is strong, the Communist party is losing its
electorate. Older supporters are dying off, and attempts to court
younger voters have been mostly unsuccessful.
</P>
<P>
   Zyuganov, 56, has softened his party's hard-line platform in
attempts to broaden his appeal, but his calls for re-nationalizing
many enterprises and implementing strict government control over
the economy are anathema to many Russians who don't want to turn
back the clock to the Soviet era.
</P>
<P>
   Zyuganov began his career as a regional official in the Soviet
Communist Party's youth branch Komsomol, and moved to Moscow in
1989.
</P>
<P>
   He entered national politics as leader of the Communist Party in
1993, when the party won the largest chunk of seats in the lower
house of parliament. It was a surprisingly strong showing after the
party had been banned for a year following a hard-line coup attempt
in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   The party still has the largest number of seats in parliament,
but hasn't been able to wield its power effectively.
</P>
<P>
   Zyuganov also hasn't been able to prevent a split in his own
ranks. Several party members left for other political movements
before last December's parliamentary election.

<HEADLINE> Canadiens 3, Lightning 1  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- Patrice Brisebois snapped a 21-game
goal-scoring drought with two third-period goals as the Montreal
Canadiens beat the Tampa Bay Lightning 3-1 Sunday night and moved
into eighth place in the Eastern Conference.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Hackett stopped 29 shots as the Canadiens moved one point
ahead of Buffalo in the race for the Eastern Conference's final
postseason berth.
</P>
<P>
   Brisebois' first goal came on a wrist shot from just inside the
blue line that deflected off defenseman Cory Sarich at 6:35. His
second was a slap shot from the right point on the power play at
10:49.
</P>
<P>
   The Lightning dominated the opening two periods -- outshooting
Montreal 23-9 -- but needed a short-handed goal from Brian Holzinger
late in the second period to tie it 1-1.
</P>
<P>
   The goal was Holzinger's first with Tampa Bay -- in his sixth
game -- and first in 20 games.
</P>
<P>
   Tampa Bay has lost four straight and are 2-11-1 in its past 14
games. The Lightning are winless in eight home games (0-6-2)
against Montreal.
</P>
<P>
   Dainius Zubrus had the lone first-period goal for Montreal. It
was the forward's first in 18 games.
</P>
<P>
   Montreal was without scoring leader Martin Rucinsky, who is
day-to-day with back spasms. The forward, who has 23 goals and 46
points, was hurt in Montreal's 4-2 loss Saturday night to Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Tampa Bay defenseman Pavel Kubina also missed the game with a
bruised heel. He is scheduled to undergo an MRI exam Monday.

<HEADLINE> Florida 77, Oklahoma St. 65  </HEADLINE>
By JIM O'CONNELL, AP Basketball Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYRACUSE, N.Y. (AP) -- Florida coach Billy Donovan thought his
Gators had run out of energy. They found just enough to beat
another higher-seeded team and advance to the Final Four.
</P>
<P>
   With seven sophomores and freshmen in the 10-man rotation, the
fifth-seeded Gators beat third-seeded Oklahoma State and its seven
seniors 77-65 Sunday in the East Regional final.
</P>
<P>
   ''With eight minutes left we were running on empty,'' Donovan
said. ''The last eight minutes we had to grind it out with them. I
think they were exhausted and we were, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Led by the 34-year-old Donovan, the Gators will play resurgent
North Carolina, which beat Tulsa 59-55 in the South Regional final,
on Saturday in Indianapolis. Wisconsin, like North Carolina an
eighth seed, will play Michigan State, the only No. 1 seed left, in
the other semifinal.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're not going to play North Carolina differently than any
other game,'' said Kenyan Weaks, the team's only senior.
</P>
<P>
   The Gators' only other trip to the Final Four was in 1994, when
most of the current players were in grade school and Donovan was
about to become the youngest head coach in Division I at Marshall.
</P>
<P>
   Using the same press that wore down fourth-seeded Illinois in
the second round and top-seeded Duke in the regional semifinals.
Florida (28-7) forced Oklahoma State (27-7) into turnovers and also
wore the Cowboys down, especially point guard Doug Gottlieb, who
looked exhausted in the first half from trying to constantly beat
the pressure.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was really concerned, not with the mental part because we
handled the Duke win well that way, but physically if we could play
our style after spending so much energy against Duke,'' Donovan
said. ''The first five or six minutes I could see Oklahoma State
was winded and tired, too.''
</P>
<P>
   A 10-0 run gave the Gators a 33-18 lead with 9:39 left in the
first half and they were up 43-31 at halftime.
</P>
<P>
   Twice in the second half Oklahoma State, which starts four
seniors but was facing its first single-digit seed in the
tournament, came up with runs to make it close, but the Gators
didn't fold.
</P>
<P>
   Desmond Mason and Glendon Alexander hit 3-pointers in a 9-0 run
that brought the Cowboys within 50-42 with 14:12 left, but Donovan
called a timeout, changed all five players, and the lead was back
to 54-42 after Oklahoma State turned the ball over on three
consecutive possessions.
</P>
<P>
   Alexander hit another 3 to cap a 7-0 that made it 56-53 with
7:56 left, but Florida scored the next seven points. Mike Miller
scored the last five, making two free throws, grabbing the rebound
on a missed jumper by Oklahoma State then burying a 3-pointer with
6:16 left to make it 63-53.
</P>
<P>
   The closest the Cowboys got the rest of the way was eight
points.
</P>
<P>
   ''We had a lot of chances to back in but we didn't take
advantage of them and missed some easy shots,'' Mason said.
</P>
<P>
   Oklahoma State coach Eddie Sutton said he had to rest Gottlieb
because he thought his point guard was fatigued.
</P>
<P>
   ''I thought we looked to be in a daze early,'' Sutton said.
''The press didn't bother as much I thought as it speeded us up and
we didn't do a good job of controlling the tempo.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller led Florida with 14 points, and Udonis Haslem and Donnell
Harvey added 10 each.
</P>
<P>
   Fredrik Jonzen had 14 points for the Cowboys, while Alexander
added 13 and Joe Adkins 12, eight in the final minute.
</P>
<P>
   Miller, selected the regional's MVP, won the opening-round game
over 12th-seeded Butler with a game-winning drive at the buzzer in
overtime, the Gators' only close game of the four in the regional.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't know there's been so much difference,'' Miller said of
the team since the opening-round win. ''We felt we lived to see
another day and we're going to Indianapolis with the same
mindset.''
</P>
<P>
   The most impressive of the wins was the 87-78 victory over Duke
in the semifinals, the school's first win ever over a top-ranked
team.
</P>
<P>
   ''We didn't have much gas today after the Duke game, but we
found a way,'' Donovan said. ''I'm not worried about that (Final
Four) right now. I want to celebrate this for a little bit with
these kids. The last 48 hours for us has been an emotional
roller-coaster ride, from playing Duke to having to play Oklahoma
State. These guys, to their credit being so young really remained
very, very focused and didn't get caught in the moment of Duke.''
</P>
<P>
   The Gators looked fresher than the Cowboys in the first half.
Miller had a great spin move that led to a left-handed layup midway
through and freshman Brett Nelson drew some cheers from the crowd
of 30,388 at the Carrier Dome with an around-the-waist move as he
went in ahead of the field for a layup.
</P>
<P>
   Donovan, who played in the Final Four with Providence in 1987,
will join Dean Smith, Bob Knight, Vic Bubas, Dick Harp and Bones
McKinney as the only men to coach and play in the national
semifinals.
</P>
<P>
   ''When you're young you're selfish, you're worried about you,''
Donovan said. ''As you get older the thing that makes this special
is I got to share it with the people who matter to me and got a
chance to see what it means to these kids.''
</P>
<P>
   Sutton was looking for his third Final Four appearance. He led
Arkansas there in 1978 and Oklahoma State in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ''After the game I thanked Coach for the three best years of my
life,'' Gottlieb said. ''Every player dreams of getting to play
four games in the NCAA tournament. A fifth would have been great.''
</P>
<P>
   Oklahoma State finished with 17 turnovers after committing just
33 in the first three tournament games, including only six in the
semifinal win over 10th-seeded Seton Hall.

<HEADLINE> OPEC Nears Consensus on Oil Output  </HEADLINE>
By BRUCE STANLEY, AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   VIENNA, Austria (AP) -- Some relief could be at hand for
motorists bitter about the sharply higher prices they've had to pay
for a fillup since March of last year.
</P>
<P>
   OPEC oil ministers were nearing a consensus Sunday on the need
to boost output in order to rein in soaring petroleum prices and
mollify the United States and other oil-importing nations.
</P>
<P>
   Although the ministers refused to confirm the size or timing of
any such increase, Kuwait's oil minister, Sheikh Saud Nasser
al-Sabah, said the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting
Countries is likely to raise its official output by as much as 1.7
million barrels of crude a day.
</P>
<P>
   The 11 OPEC ministers will meet today to decide whether to
extend production cuts made in 1998 and 1999 that have propelled
oil prices to their highest levels since the Persian Gulf War. The
latest round of cuts expires at the end of the month.
</P>
<P>
   The United States is hoping for an even bigger increase in
output than what appeared to be under discussion. High prices for
gasoline and home heating oil have become a hot political issue in
this American election year, and Washington has applied intense
diplomatic pressure to try to persuade OPEC member countries to
open their taps further.
</P>
<P>
   OPEC ministers met privately in small groups in an effort to
resolve differences ahead of today's semiannual meeting.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are arriving to a consensus,'' Venezuelan Oil Minister Ali
Rodriguez told reporters at a downtown hotel. He refused to
elaborate.
</P>
<P>
   Al-Sabah, the Kuwaiti minister, said later that OPEC members
were talking about a possible increase of 1.5 million to 1.7
million barrels a day.
</P>
<P>
   However, any official increase would not be as large as it may
seem due to the more than 1 million ''unofficial'' barrels that
OPEC members are currently pumping each day. This cheating on
production quotas means that a daily increase of 1.7 million
barrels would only add about 600,000 barrels of actual new oil to
the market.
</P>
<P>
   OPEC produces more than 26 million barrels of crude each day, or
about 35 percent of the world's supply.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. and other oil-importing countries are hoping OPEC will
raise production by 2 million to 2.5 million barrels per day. Many
industry analysts worry that OPEC won't produce enough to let
consuming nations replenish their meager oil inventories and
simultaneously meet higher seasonal needs for gasoline.
</P>
<P>
   American motorists now pay an average of $1.59 per gallon for
unleaded gasoline, an increase of nearly 60 cents since prices
bottomed out at 99.8 cents per gallon in February 1999, according
to a Lundberg Survey of 10,000 U.S. gas stations released Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Industry analysts warn of possible shortages and $2-a-gallon gas
during the peak driving season this summer.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Energy Secretary Bill Richardson recently visited eight
OPEC countries to lobby for greater production as a way of easing
prices down from nine-year-highs.
</P>
<P>
   But Iran's oil minister on Saturday urged OPEC to resist U.S.
diplomatic efforts.
</P>
<P>
   ''U.S. pressures are meaningless to us. We hope OPEC members
will not give in to political pressures,'' the Iranian minister,
Bijan Namdar Zanganeh, told state-run Tehran radio in Vienna.
</P>
<P>
   Zanganeh said OPEC producers must set aside political
considerations and make decisions today based on their national and
economic interests.
</P>
<P>
   Iran is a major OPEC producer, second only to Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
   The Saudis want to stabilize prices at a level that won't cause
extreme economic pain for the nations that buy its oil.
</P>
<P>
   If high prices start damaging economies, producers fear demand
for oil will plunge and that OPEC's earnings from crude oil sales
could evaporate.
</P>
<P>
   Some other OPEC members, including Libya and Algeria, have been
reluctant to support an increase in output because they are already
producing at levels near their physical limits.
</P>
<P>
   Non-OPEC producers that have cut output in tandem with the
cartel, such as Mexico and Norway, favor higher production but are
waiting first to see what OPEC does.
</P>
<P>
   Still, oil prices are the product of a multitude of factors.
Unexpectedly warm weather this spring, for example, could offset an
increase in OPEC's output by causing an early spike in the demand
for gasoline.
</P>
<P>
   ''They're still thinking they can fine-tune production and
somehow get prices to do what they want them to do,'' said Bill
Edwards of Houston-based Edwards Energy Consultants. ''They
can't.''
</P>
<P>
   A subcommittee of three OPEC members -- Iran, Kuwait and Nigeria
-- met late Sunday and determined that the group was 75 percent
compliant with its production cuts in February. The subcommittee
was likely to recommend a production policy to other members today.

<HEADLINE> Lutherans Convene in Minn.  </HEADLINE>
By GIOVANNA DELL'ORTO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   MAHTOMEDI, Minn. (AP) -- Lutherans opposed to terms of a new
alliance with the Episcopal Church want leaders of both
denominations to rework the pact to restore the way Lutherans
ordain their clergy.
</P>
<P>
   About a thousand Lutherans from around the country gathered
Sunday for the opening of the constituting convention of WordAlone
Network, an organization formed to oppose the Episcopal ordination
practice known as the ''historic episcopate.''
</P>
<P>
   Last summer, the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America approved
a pact with the Episcopal Church to recognize and share each
other's sacraments and clergy and cooperate in missionary projects.
Together, they have about 7.5 million members.
</P>
<P>
   But the agreement requires Lutherans to follow the historic
episcopate: Each bishop is installed by a laying on of hands by
three predecessor bishops from a line believed to extend back to
Christ's apostles.
</P>
<P>
   The historic episcopate weakens the Lutheran tradition of the
priesthood of all believers, said the Rev. David Preus, president
of the American Lutheran Church before it merged with the Lutheran
Church of America to form today's ELCA.
</P>
<P>
   The purpose of the four-day convention is to plan forms of
resistance, said the Rev. Roger Eigenfeld, WordAlone chair and
pastor of St. Andrew's Lutheran Church, the host congregation in
this St. Paul suburb.
</P>
<P>
   Eigenfeld said WordAlone's goal is to make Lutheran leaders
rework the pact so that the historic episcopate is not mandatory.
The resistance might lead to a schism in the Chicago-based ELCA,
the nation's largest Lutheran denomination, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We aren't going to leave. We want to stay,'' Eigenfeld said.
''But we might get kicked out.''
</P>
<P>
   Episcopalians are expected to approve the pact with the ELCA
during a convention in July. Calls to Episcopal Church headquarters
were not returned Sunday.

<HEADLINE> Two Long Shots Reach Final Four  </HEADLINE>
By HAL BOCK, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   Surprise, surprise.
</P>
<P>
   Two long-shot teams that almost didn't make the NCAA tournament
are headed to the Final Four. They'll be joined by the only
remaining No. 1 seed and another unlikely team that came within a
second of losing in the opening round.
</P>
<P>
   North Carolina and Wisconsin, both seeded eighth, will play
along with top-seeded Michigan State and No. 5 Florida in the
national semifinals next Saturday at the RCA Dome in Indianapolis.
</P>
<P>
   For the Tar Heels and Badgers, the Final Four berths are payoffs
for peaking at the end of difficult seasons. For the Spartans and
Gators, the trip to Indianapolis is an opportunity to punctuate
successful seasons.
</P>
<P>
   At No. 8, Wisconsin and North Carolina are the lowest seeds to
reach the Final Four since No. 11 LSU made it in 1986. The last No.
8 to get this far was Villanova, which won the national
championship from that spot in 1985.
</P>
<P>
Wisconsin (22-13) vs. Michigan State (30-7)
</P>
<P>
   Wisconsin finished sixth in the Big Ten but has lost just three
games since Feb. 2, all of them to conference champion Michigan
State, winners of nine straight.
</P>
<P>
   ''We haven't figured out a way to score against them yet,''
coach Dick Bennett said. ''Michigan State is one of the premier
defensive teams in the country. They're hard to score against.''
</P>
<P>
   Michigan State coach Tom Izzo knows the three earlier games
don't matter much now against a Wisconsin team that is in the Final
Four for the first time in 59 years.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think it's ever easy to beat a team twice or beat a
team three times,'' he said. ''We know it's going to be tough to
beat a team four times. They are on a roll and making shots now.''
</P>
<P>
   These are two grind-it-out teams with Michigan State depending
on the senior leadership of Mateen Cleaves, Charlie Bell and Morris
Peterson and Wisconsin riding the hot 3-point shooting of Division
II transfer Jon Bryant.
</P>
<P>
   Take it from Mike Kelley, the Badgers aren't going to roll over
now.
</P>
<P>
   ''We had a chance for a letdown after Fresno State, after
Arizona, and after LSU,'' he said. ''We could have fallen to that
temptation, but we didn't. We are a very competitive group. It
doesn't matter if it is basketball or bridge, we all go out to
win.''
</P>
<P>
North Carolina (22-13) vs. Florida (28-7)
</P>
<P>
   For the Tar Heels, this marks a 15th trip to the Final Four and
third in the past four years. It was one of the least expected.
Coach Bill Guthridge was under fire during a difficult 13-loss
season that had some people believing North Carolina would not be
invited.
</P>
<P>
   The Tar Heels stumbled in with four losses in six games and a
mediocre 7-8 record in the season's final weeks. Their No. 8 seed
matched their lowest in 22 years of being seeded and they had been
a No. 1 or 2 seed in their previous seven Final Fours.
</P>
<P>
   ''Obviously, since we were an eighth seed, this was
unexpected,'' Guthridge said. ''But I believed and the team
believed and that's why we're going.''
</P>
<P>
   The four-game winning streak in the tournament was the first all
season for North Carolina. ''We became a team and started playing
together,'' senior point guard Ed Cota said.
</P>
<P>
   Seven-foot Brendan Haywood gives North Carolina a presence
inside and Joseph Forte is the first freshman in school history to
lead the Tar Heels in scoring. And, yes, that includes a fellow
named Michael Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   Under fourth-year coach Billy Donovan, Florida turns games into
track meets with a go-go style and a freshman-sophomore dominated
roster that can sustain it.
</P>
<P>
   The Gators are led by sophomore Mike Miller, who saved their
tournament with a game-winning shot with a fraction of a second
left in the opener against Butler. After that, Florida took down
No. 1 seed Duke and No. 3 Oklahoma State to win the East bracket.
</P>
<P>
   Guthridge thinks Carolina can handle the up-and-down style the
Gators play.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think the experience in playing against some athletic teams
in our league and in non-conference has helped us,'' he said. ''We
are not bad athletes. The coach is a bad athlete, but we've got
some pretty good athletes on our team.''

<HEADLINE> Shooting Said Key To Oklahoma Loss  </HEADLINE>
By WILLIAM KATES, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYRACUSE, N.Y. (AP) -- Doug Gottlieb had a simple explanation for
Oklahoma State's loss to Florida in the East Regional final -- and
it had nothing to do with the Gators' relentless pressure.
</P>
<P>
   ''We didn't hit shots,'' Gottlieb said after Florida beat
Oklahoma State 77-65 on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, Oklahoma State was able to break Florida's
fullcourt press by throwing over the top or having Gottlieb dribble
through it. In fact, the Gators finished with 22 turnovers compared
to the Cowboys' 18. But the Cowboys were 25-for-59 from the field.
</P>
<P>
   ''Uptempo, it's not something we try to avoid. We averaged 75
points a game. It's just a different style than we usually see, and
they run waves at you,'' said the senior point guard, who had just
one turnover in 32 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ''The big thing is when you play at that speed sometimes the
same shots that you normally get, because you are moving so much,
because you are going up and down so much, maybe your shots are out
of rhythm.''
</P>
<P>
   Florida scored 33 points in the first 9{ minutes. Over the next
eight minutes though, the Gators made just three baskets. During
that span, Oklahoma State shaved a 15-point deficit to eight, but
the Cowboys missed several layups and Andre Williams missed an
uncontested dunk.
</P>
<P>
   ''We had a lot of chances to get ourselves back in the game and
to make plays and we didn't complete those plays,'' said Desmond
Mason, who finished with nine points, half his average, on 2-for-8
shooting.
</P>
<P>
   ''We missed easy shots. We missed wide open shots. We had our
chances and we didn't take advantage of it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In the second half, the Gators built a 17-point cushion only to
have Oklahoma State cut it to three at 56-53 with eight minutes to
play. That was as close as the Cowboys got.
</P>
<P>
   ''We felt we were back in it,'' said senior guard Joe Adkins,
who had 12 points on 4-for-14 shooting. ''We were knocking down
shots but we used a lot of energy. We got the same shots at the end
but we missed them. That's their game plan, though, to wear you
down.''
</P>
<P>
   Coach Eddie Sutton, too, thought his team handled Florida's
press well, but made some foolish mistakes and missed easy baskets.
</P>
<P>
   ''They had 22 turnovers and we had 18, which is a little
surprising. But at least six or seven were just our own doing. I
don't think it was there defense as much as carelessness on our
part,'' Sutton said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Missing those easy shot when you're in a big time game is
going to come back to haunt you, and it certainly did.''

<HEADLINE> Study: Cops Fail To Report Force  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) -- Police in Louisville don't always report
their use of force against suspects, and the system for monitoring
that use of force has serious flaws, according to a 10-month
investigation by The Courier-Journal.
</P>
<P>
   Arrests reports obtained by the newspaper for a story Sunday
show officers routinely ''struggle with,'' ''tackle,'' ''fight,''
''wrestle with'' or ''pepper spray'' people without filling out a
use-of-force report. The document is intended to be an official,
detailed statement to the police command on why and how force was
used.
</P>
<P>
   Officers are required to file the reports under certain
circumstances, and commanders are then supposed to review them.
</P>
<P>
   But when officers do properly report the use of force, the
department performs no analysis of how, when, where, how often and
against whom its officers use force, the investigation found. As a
result, top commanders lack tools necessary to discern trends,
improve training or identify potential problem officers for
counseling or discipline.
</P>
<P>
   Although there are no legal requirements to do so, ''the
recording and analysis of officers' use of force is a necessary
tool to control any excessive actions,'' Geoffrey Alpert of the
University of South Carolina and Michael Smith of Virginia
Commonwealth University wrote recently.
</P>
<P>
   The Courier-Journal began its review last year, after the death
of a black jail inmate and the shooting of an unarmed black
teenager generated calls for more civilian oversight of Louisville
police and fueled a community debate over police conduct.
</P>
<P>
   City police arrest records, use-of-force reports and civilian
complaints filed from 1996 through 1999 were examined.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 848 times during the past four years police officers did
report instances of force used against a suspect, only three times
did commanders deem the force to be unjustified.
</P>
<P>
   That means that fewer than 1 percent of the cases were
disapproved, a rate that national authorities on police say is
extremely low. Studies show that the incidence of excessive force
varies, but all put it well above 1 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In hundreds of other instances -- the newspaper found more than
600 that occurred during the last two years alone -- officers said
in arrest records that they used physical force, but they did not
document it on a use-of-force report.
</P>
<P>
   The underreporting of force appears to happen in large part
because the use-of-force policy is written too narrowly, experts
say.
</P>
<P>
   Both Ron Ricucci, the city's public safety director, and Doug
Hamilton, who was police chief from 1990 to 1999, said that if
officers don't fill out reports when they're required, it's the
responsibility of first-line supervisors -- sergeants and
lieutenants -- to demand them.
</P>
<P>
   Ricucci said last week that he believes the city has ''a pretty
good grip on'' use-of-force reporting in the wake of procedures
instituted last June. The new policy requires that officers call
supervisors to the scene when they use force, and that reports be
written.
</P>
<P>
   ''I feel pretty confident with the reporting system that's in
place today,'' Ricucci said.
</P>
<P>
   But after the newspaper showed Ricucci a sampling of five arrest
reports describing fights between officers and suspects -- all
occurring between July 4 and Oct. 14 -- and the department was
unable to find use-of-force reports in any of those cases, Ricucci
said he was concerned.

<HEADLINE> Lakers 90, Kings 89  </HEADLINE>
By ROB GLOSTER, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- After an entire game of pounding his
way inside for 15 baskets, Shaquille O'Neal faced his biggest
challenge with 6.5 seconds remaining and the game on the line.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal responded by calmly swishing a free throw to complete a
three-point play, giving the Los Angeles Lakers a 90-89 victory
over the Sacramento Kings on Sunday in what could be a preview of a
first-round playoff series.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings had one last possession, but O'Neal blocked a shot
from the top of the key by Vlade Divac with 1 second remaining.
O'Neal grabbed the loose ball, flung it high into the stands and
then hugged teammate Kobe Bryant in celebration.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal finished with 34 points as the Lakers won their sixth
straight and their 25th in the last 26 games. Bryant had 24 points
and tied his career high with 14 rebounds. Glen Rice had 18 points
and 10 rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Webber had 28 points, 15 rebounds, eight assists and four
blocks before fouling out in the closing minutes for Sacramento,
which had its seven-game home winning streak snapped. Jason
Williams added 21 points and six assists.
</P>
<P>
   If the season ended today, the Lakers would be the No. 1 seed in
the Western Conference playoffs. The Kings are tied with Seattle
for the seventh and eighth spots in the conference. The No. 1 and
No. 8 teams meet in the first round.
</P>
<P>
   Sacramento led 50-47 at halftime, and never trailed in the third
period. Rice's 3-pointer tied it 67-67 with two minutes remaining
in the quarter, but the Kings finished the period with a 6-1 run to
enter the fourth with a 73-68 lead.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers opened the fourth with an 11-2 run that included
3-pointers by Rice and Robert Horry, but the Kings tied it 79-79 on
baskets by Webber and Tony Delk.
</P>
<P>
   Two more baskets by Delk were offset by four free throws by Rice
and one by Bryant, and Los Angeles led 84-83 with 6:06 remaining.
The Kings then scored five straight, including a turnaround jumper
by Webber, to make it 88-84.
</P>
<P>
   There was a brief skirmish between Divac and Horry with 2:11
remaining after Divac pushed Bryant while they battled for position
under the basket. O'Neal also was called for a technical foul
during the sequence.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal hit a free throw and, after Webber fouled out, Bryant
scored to pull the Lakers within 88-87. Bryant missed a shot with
26 seconds remaining, and Darrick Martin hit one of two free throws
to give Sacramento an 89-87 lead with 18 seconds left.
</P>
<P>
   Webber had a double-double by halftime, with 22 points and 11
rebounds in the first two periods. He had 14 points and nine
rebounds in the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal (21 points) and Bryant (18) combined to score 39 of the
Lakers' 47 points in the first half.
</P>
<P>
Notes: The Lakers have won 13 of their last 14 road games. ... The
Kings' magic number for clinching a playoff spot remained at two.
The Lakers already are assured of a postseason berth. ...
Sacramento's Predrag Stojakovic missed his third straight game with
sprained right thumb and index fingers. ... Minnesota Vikings wide
receiver Randy Moss, a high school teammate of Williams, attended
the game. ... Sacramento's Jon Barry did not play in the second
half because of a pinched nerve in his right shoulder. ... O'Neal
entered the game needing 33 points to maintain his lead over
Philadelphia's Allen Iverson in the NBA scoring race.

<HEADLINE> Dow Jones Offers Islamic Course  </HEADLINE>
By NINA RIZZO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   PRINCETON, N.J. (AP) -- The Prophet of Islam was no stranger to
the marketplace. Mohammed's example as a successful trader has been
emulated by Muslims for generations.
</P>
<P>
   Since the seventh century, religious scholars have been
interpreting Islamic law and establishing acceptable business
practices and investment guidelines for Muslims.
</P>
<P>
   Now, they are taking those tenets to the Internet. Dow Jones
University, a division of Dow Jones &AMP; Co., which publishes The Wall
Street Journal, has gathered four highly regarded experts in the
field of Islamic law to teach an online course titled ''Principles
of Islamic Investing.''
</P>
<P>
   ''While conventional thinking on Wall Street is that religion
has no place in investment decisions, the Islamic faith asserts
emphatically that it has everything to do with those decisions,''
said Yusuf Talal DeLorenzo, of Ashburn, Va., an Islamic scholar and
course instructor.
</P>
<P>
   Islamic investing is fast emerging as a financial sector.
</P>
<P>
   There are between 4 million and 6 million Muslims living in the
United States, and Muslims are the nation's fast-growing population
segment, according to the Macdonald Center for the Study of Islam
and Christian-Muslim Relations at Hartford Seminary in Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   Muslims worldwide have $80 billion-$150 billion to invest, a
figure that is growing between 12 percent and 15 percent per year,
said A. Rushdi Siddiqui, director of the Dow Jones Islamic Market
Index and a course instructor.
</P>
<P>
   The index, established last year, tracks about 650 companies
that adhere to Islamic tenets. It has a total market capitalization
of nearly $10 trillion.
</P>
<P>
   ''Wealth management is considered a religious responsibility,''
said Siddiqui, who is also a course instructor.
</P>
<P>
   Most practicing Muslims know not to invest in the ''sin''
industries -- those that produce alcohol, entertainment, pork
products, conventional banking services and other vices forbidden
by the Koran, the holy scripture of Islam.
</P>
<P>
   They may not know supermarkets and advertising agencies are not
acceptable investments because they do not quantify their earnings.
</P>
<P>
   The board of Islamic law scholars that approves companies to be
listed on the Islamic Market Index must be able to determine the
source of the company's profits. There are no Internet companies in
the index because much of their income is derived from advertising,
Siddiqui said.
</P>
<P>
   To date, 14 financial institutions have been licensed to offer
financial products in the Islamic Market Index. Siddiqui said some
of those companies have begun to offer financial products geared to
Muslims in Europe and the Middle East, but not yet in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   Saturna Capital Corp., of Bellingham, Wash., offers two mutual
funds for Muslims stateside. It is not a Dow Jones licensee.
</P>
<P>
   Youshaa Patel of Chicago said he enrolled in the Dow Jones
course because it is an opportunity to align his financial goals
with his faith-based goals.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't want my desire for financial success to get in the way
of my religious obligations,'' said Patel, a 23-year-old Muslim who
works for a management and technology consulting firm.

<HEADLINE> Angelina Jolie Takes Home Oscar  </HEADLINE>
By BOB THOMAS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Angelina Jolie, the disruptive mental patient
in ''Girl, Interrupted,'' won the Academy Award for best supporting
actress Sunday night, a generation after her father took home an
Oscar.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm surprised nobody's ever fainted up here,'' the 24-year-old
actress said, thanking numerous people including her father, Jon
Voight, a best actor winner for ''Coming Home'' and nominee for
''Midnight Cowboy.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Dad, you're a great actor, but a better father,'' Jolie said.
</P>
<P>
   Jolie's honor was the night's first major award of the evening.
''Topsy-Turvy'' won two early awards, for makeup and costume
design, while ''The Matrix'' won for sound.
</P>
<P>
   ''American Beauty'' topped most critic lists going into the
ceremony, and it was named best picture in Friday's controversial
Wall Street Journal poll of 356 of the 5,607 voting Academy
members.
</P>
<P>
   Scientific or not, the survey was ''American Beauty's'' clincher
for best buzz going into the Oscar show, broadcast on ABC with
Billy Crystal as host.
</P>
<P>
   The poll's other favorites also seemed to reflect pre-Oscar
conventional wisdom: Denzel Washington for leading actor in ''The
Hurricane,'' Hilary Swank for leading actress in ''Boys Don't
Cry,'' Michael Caine for supporting actor in ''The Cider House
Rules,'' and Jolie for supporting actress.
</P>
<P>
   When nominations were announced, ''American Beauty'' and ''The

<HEADLINE> Kings 4, Thrashers 1  </HEADLINE>
By PAUL NEWBERRY, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA (AP) -- Brad Chartrand scored the tie-breaking goal in
the second period, Glen Murray added an insurance goal in the third
and the Los Angeles Kings defeated the Atlanta Thrashers 4-1 Sunday
night.
</P>
<P>
   After being pulled in his last start, Stephane Fiset bounced
back to make 26 saves for the Kings, who won for only the second
time in seven games.
</P>
<P>
   Chartrand scored his sixth goal at 11:51 of the second, breaking
a 1-1 tie. Camped out between the faceoff circles, he deflected
Jason Blake's shot from the blue line past Thrashers goalie Damian
Rhodes.
</P>
<P>
   Murray sealed the victory at 6:48 of the third with his 27th
goal, firing in the rebound after Rhodes made a pad save on the
initial shot by Craig Johnson. Ian Laperriere added an empty-net
goal with 11 seconds to go.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first meeting between the teams since a four-player
deal in which the Thrashers sent captain Kelly Buchberger to Los
Angeles. He started for the Kings and was greeted with cheers from
the crowd, one holding up a sign that said, ''We Miss U
Buchberger.''
</P>
<P>
   Another player in that trade, Donald Audette, assisted on the
Thrashers' lone goal at 6:13 of the second period. While a delayed
penalty was in effect, he sent a perfect pass from the right boards
to Hnat Dominechelli standing alone at the left side of the net.
</P>
<P>
   Dominechelli scored his ninth goal, tying a career high. He has
four goals since being acquired from Calgary last month.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings went ahead 1-0 at 4:58 of the second, also while
controlling the puck during a delayed penalty. Rob Blake's shot
from the point was saved by Rhodes, but Luc Robitaille knocked in
the rebound for his team-high 36th goal, marking the third straight
game he has scored.
</P>
<P>
   Prior to his streak, Robitaille has gone nine games without a
goal.
</P>
<P>
   Fiset was pulled in Boston the previous night after surrendering
four goals through two periods. Jamie Storr held the Bruins
scoreless in the third as the Kings rallied for a 4-4 tie.
</P>
<P>
   Fiset came up with a better performance against the Thrashers,
stopping a breakaway by former teammate Ray Ferraro in the final
minute of the first period.
</P>
<P>
   Rhodes made 34 saves in his sixth straight start for Atlanta,
which has won only twice in 32 games (2-27-3).
</P>
<P>
   Kerry Fraser, one of two referees, was struck under the left eye
with a puck while standing behind the Kings net in the first
period, the result of an errant shot by Atlanta's Matt Johnson.
Fraser crumpled to the ice and immediately skated to the dressing
room, where he took seven stitches.
</P>
<P>
   Rob Martell handled the referee duties alone until Fraser
returned in the second period, wearing a helmet and visor.
</P>
<P>
   Denny Lambert didn't play for the Thrashers after his wife,
Rhonda, delivered twin boys Sunday morning.

<HEADLINE> Angelina Jolie wins Academy Award as supporting actress  </HEADLINE>
By BOB THOMAS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Angelina Jolie, the disruptive mental patient
in ''Girl, Interrupted,'' won the Academy Award for best supporting
actress Sunday night, a generation after her father took home an
Oscar.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm surprised nobody's ever fainted up here,'' the 24-year-old
actress said, thanking numerous people including her father, Jon
Voight, a best actor winner for ''Coming Home'' and nominee for
''Midnight Cowboy.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Dad, you're a great actor, but a better father,'' Jolie said.
</P>
<P>
   Jolie's honor was the night's first major award of the evening.
''Topsy-Turvy'' won two early awards, for makeup and costume
design, while ''The Matrix'' won for sound.
</P>
<P>
   ''American Beauty'' topped most critic lists going into the
ceremony, and it was named best picture in Friday's controversial
Wall Street Journal poll of 356 of the 5,607 voting Academy
members.
</P>
<P>
   Scientific or not, the survey was ''American Beauty's'' clincher
for best buzz going into the Oscar show, broadcast on ABC with
Billy Crystal as host.
</P>
<P>
   The poll's other favorites also seemed to reflect pre-Oscar
conventional wisdom: Denzel Washington for leading actor in ''The
Hurricane,'' Hilary Swank for leading actress in ''Boys Don't
Cry,'' Michael Caine for supporting actor in ''The Cider House
Rules,'' and Jolie for supporting actress.
</P>
<P>
   When nominations were announced, ''American Beauty'' and ''The
Cider House Rules'' were leading contenders for best picture. The
standing of ''The Cider House Rules'' heightened as Miramax put on
an ad blitz. DreamWorks countered with a campaign for ''American
Beauty.''

Putin Appears Headed for Victory
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- Vladimir Putin appeared headed for a narrow victory Monday in
Russia's presidential election after a surprisingly strong showing by the
Communists threatened to force him into a runoff vote. With 84 percent of the
vote from Sunday's election counted by early Monday, Putin had almost 52 percent
of the vote, enough to ensure outright victory and avoid a second round runoff
against the next highest vote winner. Communist chief Gennady Zyuganov, second
with 30 percent, accused the government of falsifying the results, saying the
Communist vote was more than 40 percent.

serious flaws, according to a 10-month investigation by The Courier-Journal.

during three hours of face-to-face talks Assad stressed the importance of
Syria's long demand for an Israeli pullback to the country's 1967 borders. White
House spokesman Joe Lockhart said the meeting as ''very useful.'' But, he added,
''we don't believe it would be productive'' for Syrian-Israeli talks to resume

Castro: Elian Will Return to Cuba

United States and that it was only a matter of time before the boy was reunited
with his father in Cuba. ''The Cuban mafia has lost,'' an animated Castro
insisted before hundreds of pro-government university students gathered to press
for the child's return to his communist homeland. U.S. District Judge K. Michael
Moore's dismissal on Tuesday of the family's lawsuit seeking to block Elian's
repatriation was ''just and moral,'' Castro said.

<HEADLINE> Timberwolves 106, Raptors 101, OT  </HEADLINE>
By JASON WOLF, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- Kevin Garnett scored 34 points and the
Minnesota Timberwolves clinched a playoff berth by beating the
Toronto Raptors 106-101 in overtime Sunday for their sixth straight
win.
</P>
<P>
   Vince Carter had 38 points for the Raptors, who lost their
fourth in a row. It is Toronto's longest losing streak this season.
</P>
<P>
   Toronto's Antonio Davis made a layup as he was fouled by Wally
Szczerbiak with 12.9 seconds left in regulation, and Davis hit the
free throw to tie the game at 87-87. Szczerbiak fouled out on the
play.
</P>
<P>
   That three-point play capped an 8-1 Toronto run in the final
2:15 of the fourth quarter. Tracy McGrady had five of those points
and finished with 21.
</P>
<P>
   Garnett scored seven points in the overtime as the Timberwolves
got a quick 95-90 lead and didn't allow the Raptors within four
points.
</P>
<P>
   Terrell Brandon had 23 points for Minnesota, which has played
three overtime games in a week and won them all.
</P>
<P>
   Minnesota (43-26) is the sixth Western Conference team to secure
a postseason spot. It is 1{ games behind fourth-place Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   The Timberwolves went ahead early and led by as many as 10
points, but Toronto closed the gap to 78-76 with 4:18 left in the
fourth quarter on two free throws by Carter. He was 10-for-10 from
the free-throw line in the fourth quarter, 12-for-14 overall.
</P>
<P>
   But Carter made just 13 of 31 field goal attempts as the Raptors
were outshot 47.1 to 41.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The Raptors went a span of 5:14 in the fourth quarter between
field goals, but Carter and McGrady (7-of-9 from the free-throw
line) kept Toronto in the game.
</P>
<P>
   After Carter's two free throws with 3:03 left, Minnesota's
Anthony Peeler hit a basket and Joe Smith blocked Davis' shot,
leading to a bucket by Brandon and an 86-78 Timberwolves lead.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Carter said he hopes his acceptance of a place on the U.S.
Olympic team will end the distractions surrounding him since
Phoenix Suns forward Tom Gugliotta was injured and had to
relinquish his spot on the team. ''I'm glad it's over,'' Carter
said. ''I think people just put too much emphasis on it. I worry
about what I need to do for the Raptors right now.'' ... Carter's
dunk with 32.7 seconds left in the first half was his first in the
Raptors' last four games. ... Minnesota outrebounded Toronto 52-37.

   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) -- The ruling Nationalist Party named a new
secretary-general on Monday, part of an ongoing reshuffle at the
top of the party's ranks after a humiliating election defeat.
</P>
<P>
   Lin Fong-cheng, Taiwan's transportation and communications
minister, will serve in the post responsible for the party's
day-to-day affairs. Lin replaced Huang Kun-huei, who served less

   Lin was appointed a little more than a week after the
Nationalist's candidate, Vice President Lien Chan, finished a
distant third in the March 18 presidential election.
</P>
<P>
   Opposition leader Chen Shui-bian won the vote, ending the
Nationalists' five-decade-long control of the presidency on Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   The loss sparked protests from die-hard party loyalists that led
to the resignation of retiring President Lee Teng-hui as the
party's chairman. Lien was appointed acting party chairman last
week.
</P>
<P>
   Lin told reporters that major changes need to be made in the

<HEADLINE> Castro Blasts Elian's U.S. Relatives  </HEADLINE>
By ANITA SNOW, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   HAVANA (AP) -- Ratcheting up the rhetoric in a high-stakes
ideological battle, President Fidel Castro said Sunday that the
Miami relatives of 6-year-old Elian Gonzalez and their
anti-communist backers might kill the child or abduct him to a
third country rather than let him return to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   ''They are capable of killing him rather than return him safe
and sound to the country,'' Castro said of Miami's Cuban-American
exiles as he wrapped up a 1{-hour speech. He spoke before more than
700 pro-government university students.
</P>
<P>
   Castro suggested that the exiles could expose the child to a
serious illness in an act of vengeance against Elian's father or
the Cuban government, which have been battling for his
repatriation. He also said that according to ''reliable sources in
Miami,'' the child's ''kidnappers'' had discussed moving the child
to another location or even a third country to prevent his return
to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Wearing his trademark olive green military uniform, the
73-year-old leader seemed more confident than ever since he
launched the battle four months ago to win back Elian for his
father and the fatherland -- and conquer his anti-communist enemies
in Miami in the process. Previously, he has warned citizens not to
get too hopeful while Elian's U.S. relatives exhausted their legal
avenues.
</P>
<P>
   At stake has been more than the repatriation of a little boy.
Castro's assertion of dominance over the exiles has been key. So
has his ability to use the case to rally citizens -- especially
young ones -- behind him and against the Miami-based exiles
typically referred to here as ''the mafia'' or ''worms.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge K. Michael Moore's dismissal on Tuesday of
the family's lawsuit seeking to block Elian's repatriation was
''just and moral,'' Castro said.
</P>
<P>
   Castro said the boy should be back in Cuba within three weeks,
depending upon what other legal or political maneuvers the Miami
relatives attempt.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Justice Department late Friday told Elian's relatives
in Miami that they have until noon Monday to agree to an expedited
appeal or the boy will be returned rapidly to his father in Cuba,
according to family spokesman Armando Gutierrez.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, a federal official close to the case confirmed
that the Justice Department plans to give the family's lawyers
until April 3 to prepare and file their appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Elian has been at the center of an international tug-of-war
since late November, when he was rescued by fishermen who found him
lashed to an innertube bobbing off the Florida coast. Elian's
mother and 10 others perished when their boat sank during the
journey from Cuba to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   In Miami, Elian was turned over to his great-uncle, who is now
fighting for the right to raise him, saying he can give him a
better life off the communist island. But his father and four
grandparents, backed by Castro, have demanded the child's return to
his native country.
</P>
<P>
   For four months, the Miami relatives have successfully blocked
the child's repatriation. In an apparent bid to increase American
support for their battle to keep Elian in the United States, the
Miami relatives last week allowed television journalist Diane
Sawyer to spend two days with the boy.
</P>
<P>
   The ABC News program ''Good Morning America'' plans to air the
first of several reports Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Castro said that subjecting the child to the interview was
''monstrous and sickening'' and said that sources had told him that
the boy would denounce his father during the airing.
</P>
<P>
   ''You cannot do this without the authorization of the father,''
said Castro, who expressed worries about the child's welfare. ''I
sincerely think that this boy is at risk in the hands of desperate
people and the government of the United States should not be
running this risk,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   A Spanish-speaking child psychiatrist, with no prior connection
to the case, accompanied Sawyer on the visit, the television
network said.
</P>
<P>
   Additional portions of Sawyer's report will likely be aired on
Tuesday, and on ''20/20'' Wednesday, the network said.

<HEADLINE> Poll shows Clinton-Giuliani races tightening as she picks upsupport  </HEADLINE>
By MARC HUMBERT, AP Political Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- With a new poll showing the Senate race
between Hillary Rodham Clinton and Mayor Rudolph Giuliani
tightening, the first lady picked up the first political party
endorsement of the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ''I consider this the beginning of a partnership,'' Clinton told
the Working Families Party convention in Albany.
</P>
<P>
   Promising to be 'a voice and a vote'' in the Senate for working
families, the first lady said ''my opponent and his fellow
Republicans want us to do a U-turn back to the 1980s where we had
skyrocketing deficits and disinvestment ... I'm not just someone
who says I'm for family values, I'm for valuing families.''
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton left the heavy Giuliani bashing to others at the
gathering of the small, labor union-backed third party.
</P>
<P>
   ''They say if you want to keep the beer real cold, put it next
to Rudy's heart,'' said Jim Hightower, a radio talk-show host and
former Texas agriculture commissioner, to the cheers of the almost
1,000 party loyalists on hand.
</P>
<P>
   Greeting those attending the party convention were some fliers
made up to look like wanted posters and featuring a caricature of
Giuliani. The fliers charged the New York City mayor with ''crimes
against humanity'' and said ''he has been known to use the alias
Adolph.''
</P>
<P>
   Larry Moskowitz, labor coordinator for the Working Families
Party, said ''we absolutely do not subscribe to this'' and
maintained that if party leaders had seen those passing out the
fliers, ''they would have been stopped.''
</P>
<P>
   The fliers purported to be from a group called the Citywide
Coalition to Stop Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
   The Working Families Party was created in New York two years ago
to push the Democratic Party toward the left, and to help the
Senate candidacy of Democrat Charles Schumer against Republican
incumbent Alfonse D'Amato. Schumer won that race.
</P>
<P>
   While Clinton has shunned the liberal label, insisting she is a
''New Democrat'' with a middle-of-the-road agenda, the backing of
the Working Families Party provides the Giuliani camp with yet
another opportunity to paint her as a left-leaning politician.
</P>
<P>
   Minor party endorsements can be valuable in the race because
unlike other states, New York allows major party candidates to add
votes cast for them on third party ballot lines to their overall
vote total. That can make the difference in close elections.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a New York Post poll out Sunday and conducted by
Zogby International showed Clinton favored by 45 percent of likely
voters surveyed to 42 percent for the New York City mayor, a
statistical tie. A Zogby poll conducted three weeks ago had
Giuliani leading the first lady, 49 percent to 42 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Pollster John Zogby attributed the shift, in part, to voter
dissatisfaction with the mayor's handling of the shooting 10 days
ago of an unarmed black man, Patrick Dorismond, by New York City
police.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's handing her the race,'' Zogby said.
</P>
<P>
   The statewide telephone poll of 710 likely voters was conducted
Friday and Saturday and has a margin of error of plus or minus 4
percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   Two other statewide polls -- by Marist College's Institute for
Public Opinion and by the Quinnipiac College Polling Institute --
taken before the Dorismond shooting had shown Giuliani with slight
leads over the first lady. A CBS News-New York Times poll had shown
the race even.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani has come under fire for having police release
Dorismond's criminal record, including sealed juvenile records,
instead of consoling the family. On Saturday, after Dorismond's
funeral, mourners and police clashed in New York City leaving
people injured on both sides.
</P>
<P>
   Appearing on Fox News Sunday, Clinton campaign manager Bill de
Blasio said the Rev. Jesse Jackson had gone too far last week in
questioning Giuliani's mental health in the wake of the Dorismond
shooting.
</P>
<P>
   ''With all due respect to Reverend Jackson, I don't think
Hillary or any of the rest of us agree with that. The mayor clearly
is divisive. That's the thing you can say here. But you can't go
beyond that ... any further comment beyond that is just unfair.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview with New York magazine, Clinton said one of the
advantages she brings to the Senate campaign and her potential
service in the Senate is the thick skin she has developed over the
years.
</P>
<P>
   ''Part of what I bring is that there is nothing anybody can say
about me that will hurt my feelings, '' she told the magazine. ''I
cannot be insulted. You know, I just can't be.''

<HEADLINE> Billy Crystal an Oscar Crowd Hit  </HEADLINE>
By JEFF WILSON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Billy Crystal again showed he had a flair for
entrances.
</P>
<P>
   The Oscar host rode his ''City Slickers'' steed on stage in
1991, wheeled in as a masked Hannibal ''The Cannibal'' Lecter in
1992 and leaned over the bow of ''Titanic'' in 1998. He arrived on
the Academy Awards stage Sunday in the arms of a policeman.
</P>
<P>
   ''I just wanted to make sure I got here,'' Crystal said,
alluding to the Los Angeles Police Department's return of stolen
Oscar statuettes to the academy last week.
</P>
<P>
   He then poked fun at the scandal sweeping the LAPD that includes
charges of falsifying evidence, framing innocent people and lying
under oath to win convictions.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's why I had the LAPD plant me here,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Crystal's highly anticipated entrance became a Hollywood
guessing game due to recent misfortunes facing the Academy of
Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, including lost ballots and the
stolen Oscars, which were ultimately found in a trash bin.
</P>
<P>
   Rejected entrances reportedly included Crystal riding to stage
on a lawnmower with Richard Farnsworth. Another was wheeling out a
giant Dumpster that cracks open, spilling out Billy, purloined
Oscars, Debbie Allen and a dance number.
</P>
<P>
   Before showing up on stage, however, Crystal brought down the
house with a video montage that digitally inserted the wisecracking
host into well-known Hollywood films.
</P>
<P>
   In a silent film clip with Charlie Chaplin, the words beneath
Crystal read, ''I see dead people,'' in reference to the
Oscar-nominated film ''The Sixth Sense.'' Then there was Crystal
wearing a dress opposite Dustin Hoffman in ''The Graduate.''
</P>
<P>
   In a clip from ''The Exorcist,'' Linda Blair vomited on him. To
that, he asked her: ''Is that your final answer?''
</P>
<P>
   It was Crystal's seventh stint as Oscars host. He won Emmys in
1991 and 1992 for his writing of the Oscar show, and he got Emmy
nominations for his performances in 1991, 1992 and 1993. He won the
trophy in 1991.

Putin Appears Headed for Victory
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- Vladimir Putin looked set for victory Monday in Russia's
presidential election after a surprisingly strong showing by the Communists
threatened to force him into a runoff vote. While Putin would almost certainly
win a second round, it would have been a humbling setback for the former KGB
officer. With 91 percent of the vote from Sunday's election counted by early
Monday, Putin had 52 percent of the vote, enough to ensure victory and avoid a
second round against the next highest vote winner. Communist chief Gennady
Zyuganov was second with 29.6 percent.

Michael Caine Takes Home Oscar
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Michael Caine, the kindly orphanage headmaster in ''The
Cider House Rules,'' won his second best supporting actor Oscar today. Angelina
Jolie, the disruptive mental patient in ''Girl, Interrupted,'' won for
supporting actress -- a generation after her father took home an Oscar. Caine,
67, who previously won as supporting actor for ''Hannah and Her Sisters'' in
1986, seemed overwhelmed by the applause that greeted the announcement and he
saluted his fellow nominees. The 24-year-old Jolie thanked her father, Jon
Voight, a best actor winner for ''Coming Home'' and nominee for ''Midnight
Cowboy.'' Pop star Phil Collins scored the best original song award for his
sentimental ''You'll be in My Heart'' from the animated Disney film ''Tarzan.''

Study: Cops Fail To Report Force
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) -- Police in Louisville don't always report their use of
force against suspects, and the system for monitoring that use of force has
serious flaws, according to a 10-month investigation by The Courier-Journal.
Arrests reports obtained by the newspaper for a story today show officers
routinely ''struggle with,'' ''tackle,'' ''fight,'' ''wrestle with'' or ''pepper
spray'' people without filling out a use-of-force report.

Clinton, Assad Fall Short on Talks
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   GENEVA (AP) -- President Clinton and Syrian President Hafez Assad failed to
nail down an agreement Sunday to restart talks between Israel and Syria for a
landmark peace treaty. Syrian presidential spokesman Jubran Kourieh said that
during three hours of face-to-face talks Assad stressed the importance of
Syria's long demand for an Israeli pullback to the country's 1967 borders. White
House spokesman Joe Lockhart said the meeting as ''very useful.'' But, he added,
''we don't believe it would be productive'' for Syrian-Israeli talks to resume
at this point.

Castro: Elian Will Return to Cuba

   HAVANA (AP) -- President Fidel Castro declared today that the Miami relatives
of 6-year-old Elian Gonzalez had lost their battle to keep the child in the
United States and that it was only a matter of time before the boy was reunited
with his father in Cuba. ''The Cuban mafia has lost,'' an animated Castro
insisted before hundreds of pro-government university students gathered to press
for the child's return to his communist homeland. U.S. District Judge K. Michael
Moore's dismissal on Tuesday of the family's lawsuit seeking to block Elian's
repatriation was ''just and moral,'' Castro said.

Lutherans Convene in Minn
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   MAHTOMEDI, Minn. (AP) -- Lutherans opposed to terms of a new alliance with
the Episcopal Church want leaders of both denominations to rework the pact to
restore the way Lutherans ordain their clergy. About a thousand Lutherans from
around the country gathered today for the opening of the constituting convention
of WordAlone Network, an organization formed to oppose the Episcopal ordination
practice known as the ''historic episcopate.'' Last summer, the Evangelical
Lutheran Church in America approved a pact with the Episcopal Church to
recognize and share each other's sacraments and clergy and cooperate in
missionary projects. Together, they have about 7.5 million members.

<HEADLINE> Thefts, Stumbles Lead To Oscar Jokes  </HEADLINE>
By LYNN ELBER, AP Television Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The series of missteps and strange twists
leading to this year's Academy Awards presentation, including the
theft of Oscar statuettes, turned into comedy gold Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   Willie Fulgear, the man who found 52 of the 55 missing Oscars in
a trash bin, was introduced from the audience by host Billy
Crystal, who noted Fulgear received $50,000 in reward money.
</P>
<P>
   ''Which is not a lot of money, when you realize Miramax and
DreamWorks are spending millions of dollars just to get one,''
Crystal said, alluding to the studios waging expensive promotional
campaigns for their leading Oscar contenders, ''The Cider House
Rules'' and ''American Beauty.''
</P>
<P>
   Crystal also couldn't resist noting that the other awards
remained missing.
</P>
<P>
   ''They searched Erykah Badu's hat, and they found one of the
missing Oscars,'' Crystal said, referring to the singer's
Cat-in-the-Hat style headwrap. ''So only two more to go.''
</P>
<P>
   The host didn't stop there. After bantering with Jack Nicholson,
Crystal said: ''Jack has three Oscars. Which is no big deal,
because so does some guy in Bell,'' referring to the Los Angeles
suburb from which the statuettes were stolen.
</P>
<P>
   Later in the show, the comedian lumbered to the microphone
carrying a see-through sack of oranges hiding two Oscar statuettes
inside.
</P>
<P>
   ''We found the other two Oscars,'' he said. ''Somebody bought
these coming off the Santa Monica freeway on an offramp -- $3.99.
This is a bargain.''
</P>
<P>
   Bell also is where 4,000 misdirected Oscar ballots turned up
earlier this month, after they were mistaken for third-class mail.
The mix-up forced the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences
to mail new ones and extend its voting deadline.
</P>
<P>
   The latest irritation to the academy came Friday, when The Wall
Street Journal polled 356 of the 5,607 voting members and published
a list of projected Oscar winners.
</P>
<P>
   Crystal, citing the newspaper's predictions, assured the
audience that the Oscar winners are the best-kept secret in
America, ''with the possible exception of what George W. Bush did
in the '70s.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a reference to whether the Republican presidential
candidate used drugs in his youth. Bush has acknowledged an earlier
drinking problem but has refused to answer specific questions about
past drug use.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the turmoil of the past few weeks, the ceremony itself
went smoothly and Oscar officials appeared relaxed.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Rehme, president of the academy, even tried schtick. The
Oscar focus, he said, had shifted from who would win to ''what in
the world are we going to present them with?''

<HEADLINE> Polish Filmmaker Gets Honorary Oscar  </HEADLINE>
By CHELSEA J. CARTER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The Polish filmmaker who spent his career
maneuvering between a repressive communist government and an
audience yearning for freedom was awarded an honorary Oscar on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Andrzej Wajda, 73, whose films include the Oscar-nominated ''The
Maids of Wilko'' and ''Land of Promise,'' accepted the award ''as a
tribute to all of Polish cinema.''
</P>
<P>
   ''My fervent hope is that the only flames people will encounter
will be the great passions of the heart -- love, gratitude and
solidarity,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A resistance fighter during World War II, Wajda also used the
opportunity to thank the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ''That is why today I thank the American friends of Poland and
my compatriots for helping my country rejoin the Western
civilization, its institutions and security structures,'' he said
in Polish.
</P>
<P>
   Wajda's films never caught on with U.S. audiences, although two
have been nominated for Oscars as best foreign film: the 1975
''Land of Promise,'' a tale of lost ideals in a rush to get rich,
and the 1979 ''The Maids of Wilko'' about the inevitable demise of
love and life.
</P>
<P>
   Two of Wajda's earlier films -- ''Kanal'' in 1957 and ''Ashes and
Diamonds'' in 1958 -- drew on his experience as an anti-Nazi
resistance fighter. They portray his generation's struggle to
preserve patriotic values after surviving the Nazis only to fall
under Soviet domination.
</P>
<P>
   Despite communist censorship, he sought to help shape the social
struggle that led to Solidarity, the trade union that eventually
helped topple communist rule.
</P>
<P>
   Among his successes of that era were ''Man of Marble'' and its
1981 sequel, ''Man of Iron,'' about the disillusionment of a father
and son under the communist system.
</P>
<P>
   ''Man of Iron'' won the Cannes Film Festival's Golden Palm that
year, but the communists banned the film and withdrew it from Oscar
competition when they imposed martial law in 1981.
</P>
<P>
   After communism fell in 1989, Wajda said, his films became ''an
attempt to rediscover this part of Polish culture that has been
concealed for years.'' They included ''Korczak,'' about a Polish
Jewish teacher who died in Nazi gas chambers, and ''Easter Week,''
about Polish attitudes toward the uprising in Warsaw's Jewish
ghetto in 1943.
</P>
<P>
   Both were snubbed by Poles who preferred the flashier Hollywood
films. Wajda denounced the audience as ''either absorbed in itself
or entertainment'' and he considered giving up films.
</P>
<P>
   But this year, Wajda returned triumphantly to the screen with
''Mr. Tadeusz,'' a sweeping adaptation of poet Adam Mickiewicz's
verse-novel about life, love and intrigue among Polish nobility.

<HEADLINE> Sosa a Big Hit at the Tokyo Dome  </HEADLINE>
By BEN WALKER, AP Baseball Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO (AP) -- Mike Piazza took one look at the left-field wall
and took aim. At a cozy 317 feet from home plate, it made for an
easy target.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Mets and Chicago Cubs saw a lot to like about the
Tokyo Dome, where they'll open the major league season Wednesday
night. Especially the sluggers.
</P>
<P>
   ''The ball flies, at least when Mike hits it,'' Mets teammate
Todd Zeile said.
</P>
<P>
   Most players got their first peek at the 50,000-seat ballpark
during workouts Sunday. To some, the place playfully nicknamed the
''Big Egg'' seemed pretty foreign.
</P>
<P>
   Two rows of benches in the dugout. Black dirt on the pitcher's
mound, brown dirt around the bases. A chain-link fence for a
backstop. No warning track.
</P>
<P>
   And that was before the Seibu Lions and Tokyo Giants claimed the
field for an exhibition game. They set up side-by-side cages for
batting practice, and inside them catchers sat on wooden benches.
Later, a rookie wearing No. 122 walked past.
</P>
<P>
   ''You don't see that very often,'' observed Joe McEwing of the
Mets.
</P>
<P>
   Others found the park more familiar.
</P>
<P>
   ''You look up at that puffy, white roof and see those blue seats
and it looks just like the Metrodome,'' said Cubs pitcher Rick
Aguilera, who spent most of his career in Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   ''The only thing missing were the homer hankies,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And, like the Metrodome, it's loud. A few thousand fans, most of
them kids, watched the workouts and screamed -- ''Sign, please'' --
for autographs.
</P>
<P>
   The decibel level was doubled by an announcer standing on the
dugout roof with a hand-held microphone, commenting on the
festivities. Most Japanese games feature lively cheerleaders, too.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is a noise factor here,'' said Mets manager Bobby
Valentine, who managed Chiba Lotte in the Japanese league in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Piazza created a huge stir when he strolled over to the
third-base stands to oblige the children.
</P>
<P>
   Japanese players traditionally do not sign autographs. The
chance to get a souvenir from Piazza, extremely popular in this
country since his days of catching Hideo Nomo with the Dodgers,
made him a bigger hit.
</P>
<P>
   Even the man who stitches players' names and numbers onto the
Mets jerseys was busy signing.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm a nobody, but I'm wearing a Mets jacket and they think I'm
a player,'' Russ Gompers said. ''Hey, it makes the kids happy. You
see their faces? Everyone's smiling.''
</P>
<P>
   Piazza took part in an all-star tour to Japan after the 1996
season and hit .429 with two home runs in seven games. Before this
trip, he assured his teammates they'd enjoy the experience.
</P>
<P>
   ''Everyone was kind of apprehensive at first because they didn't
know how it was going to turn out,'' he said. ''But it's been
great.''
</P>
<P>
   ''It's fun for us,'' he said. ''It's a different kind of spring
training.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Mets third baseman Robin Ventura: ''I think everyone is
pleasantly surprised.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mets and Cubs finish their exhibition season on Monday and
Tuesday, taking turns playing Seibu and the Tokyo Giants. Then they
start a two-game series against each other.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets took a two-hour bus ride to the Seibu Dome for Monday's
game, their first since last Thursday in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're all a little sluggish,'' Piazza said. ''But something
happens when get between the lines. We'll be OK.''
</P>
<P>
   Mets outfielder Rickey Henderson hugged Tony Fernandez, who
signed with the Lions in the offseason.
</P>
<P>
   ''What are you doing here, man?'' Henderson asked.
</P>
<P>
   Other Seibu players and some fans recognized him, and waved at
baseball's career steals leader.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's nice they know who I am,'' he said. ''I've been over here
a few times, teaching some of the Japanese players how to steal
bases.''
</P>
<P>
   Sammy Sosa is still the most popular player on this visit, and
fans Sunday cheered his every swing, catch and throw during the
workout. The Cubs star responded by throwing them packs of
wristbands.
</P>
<P>
   Sosa was the MVP of an all-star tour to Japan after the 1998
season, hitting .481 with three homers and 10 RBIs. He did not hit
many balls over the wall during Sunday's practice -- then again, the
Cubs had arrived from their 18-hour trip the previous night.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm ready to go,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   While Sosa and most players headed back to their hotel, five

<HEADLINE> Tokyo Stocks Rise  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO (AP) -- Japan's main index edged higher Monday morning,
buoyed by anticipation of consolidation at manufacturers and
insurers. The U.S. dollar slipped against the yen.
</P>
<P>
   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average gained 11.52
points, or 0.06 percent, to 19,969.60 at the end of the morning
session. On Friday, the average closed up 253.48 points, or 1.29
percent.
</P>
<P>
   The dollar bought 106.92 yen at late morning, down 0.42 yen from
late Friday in Tokyo and also below its late New York level of
107.05 yen overnight.
</P>
<P>
   On the stock market, the Nikkei index moved higher on buying of
domestic demand-related issues, including those of basic materials
companies.
</P>
<P>
   Nippon Paper Industries and Daishowa Paper Manufacturing, both
industry leaders, were among morning gainers. The two are expected
to announce plans later Monday to integrate operations under a
holding company by April 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Also, newspaper reports over the weekend said two non-life
insurers, Mitsui Marine and Fire Insurance Co. and Sumitomo Marine
and Fire Insurance Co., will move a planned alliance forward to
October 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Share prices in Mitsubishi Motors Corp. rose after national
broadcaster NHK said the company would formally announce a tie-up
agreement with DaimlerChrysler in Frankfurt later in the day.
</P>
<P>
   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section was down 3.89 points, or 0.24 percent, to 1,636.71
points. The TOPIX closed down 10.95 points, or 0.66 percent, on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   In currency dealings, the dollar was lower amid selling pressure
from U.S. banks in the absence of major market-moving news Monday
morning.
</P>
<P>
   In other currencies, the euro was traded at 104.47 yen, up from
104.27 yen late Friday in Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   The yield on the benchmark 10-year Japanese government bond rose
to 1.8850 percent from Friday's finish of 1.8700 percent. Its price
fell 0.13 point to 100.12.

<HEADLINE> Putin Appears Headed for Victory  </HEADLINE>
By BARRY RENFREW, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- Vladimir Putin looked set for victory Monday in
Russia's presidential election after a surprisingly strong showing
by the Communists threatened to force him into a runoff vote.
</P>
<P>
   While Putin would almost certainly win a second round, it would
have been a humbling setback for the former KGB officer who has
soared from nowhere to become the nation's most popular politician
in a few months. Putin's call to strengthen the authority of the
state and the security forces worried some Russians, who fear the
country's democratic reforms could be rolled back.
</P>
<P>
   With 93 percent of the vote from Sunday's election counted by
Monday morning, Putin had 52.4 percent of the vote, enough to
ensure victory and avoid a second round against the next highest
vote winner. Communist chief Gennady Zyuganov was second with 29.6
percent.
</P>
<P>
   The state-run RTR television network predicted an outright Putin
victory with no runoff vote. Liberal economist Grigory Yavlinsky
was projected to take third place with about 7 percent of the vote.
</P>
<P>
   Zyuganov accused the government of falsifying the results,
saying the Communist vote was more than 40 percent. There were no
immediate reports on the fairness of the election from
international monitors.
</P>
<P>
   ''They have set up a zone of blanket fraud to cheat citizens,''
Zyuganov said.
</P>
<P>
   Putin looked likely to fall well short of his campaign's hopes
for a huge victory and a strong mandate for his call to impose
strong government at home and to revive Russia as a global power.
</P>
<P>
   Putin's campaign may have suffered from the widespread
assumption that he would win, convincing many of his supporters
that there was no need to vote. But the fairly strong vote for
Zyuganov was also seen as a protest by Russians unhappy about
Putin's apparently inevitable victory.
</P>
<P>
   Putin, looking relaxed, said he was confident of victory as he
voted at a Moscow polling station. ''Tomorrow is Monday, a hard
day, and I will have to go to work,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Putin later acknowledged the Communists had done well despite
their cash-strapped campaign and that his government would have to
take popular discontent into account.
</P>
<P>
   ''That means that our policy must be more balanced, take into
account the existing realities and aim at increasing living
standards,'' he told a news conference.
</P>
<P>
   The tough, man-of-action image that Putin cultivates appeals to
many Russians, tired of the uncertainty and mayhem of the final
years of former President Boris Yeltsin. Putin has promised to end
massive corruption, revive the economy after years of recession and
restore the political and military influence that Moscow wielded
before the Soviet collapse.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm tired of all this disorder,'' said Vladimir Prishchev, a
pensioner casting his ballot for Putin in Russia's Pacific port
city of Vladivostok, where graft is rampant and life miserable for
most people. ''When Putin takes charge of something, he takes it to
the end.''
</P>
<P>
   Some Russians, particularly liberals, fear Putin may trample
Russia's fragile democracy and restore the iron control the secret
police enforced during the Soviet era.
</P>
<P>
   But some Russian reformers and Western officials and businessmen
have praised Putin as a pragmatic reformer who will restore
stability in Russia and improve people's lives by making reforms
work.
</P>
<P>
   With a trademark poker face, Putin comes across as stern and
colorless, often cold. He is described often as resembling the
archetypal ''chekist'' or secret policeman -- which appeals to many
Russians who believe tough government alone can clean up the
country and restore stability.
</P>
<P>
   Putin insists he is a democrat, but he has been vague about his
plans beyond stressing the need for strong government.	   Some analysts say
Putin has few specific plans because of his
rapid rise to power and it may be months before his intentions are
clear. Nor is Putin likely to turn things around quickly after
decades of authoritarianism and economic disintegration, they add.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin, who stunned Russians by resigning six months early and
dubbing Putin as his political heir, said Sunday he was confident
that the younger leader would continue the reforms set in place
after the Soviet collapse.
</P>
<P>
   ''Everybody is waiting for change,'' said Yeltsin after casting
his ballot. ''There will be some changes, but the main thing is the
course of reform must stay, and it will stay. I am convinced of
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Putin, who rose through a series of mostly obscure government
posts in the 1990s and has never held elected office, was appointed
prime minister by Yeltsin in August. He gained immediate popularity
for his vigorous image and his tough handling of the war in
Chechnya. Putin was named acting president when Yeltsin resigned on
Dec. 31.
</P>
<P>
   Little is known about Putin and extensive checks by journalists
and others in recent months have produced more questions and few
insights. Unlike many prominent officials, Putin has not been
linked to major corruption, boosting his image in the eyes of
Russians who have seen political insiders amass vast fortunes while
living standards for most people plummeted.
</P>
<P>
   The election campaign was lackluster because a Putin victory
seemed inevitable. The other candidates appeared resigned to not
winning and there was little in the way of campaign rallies and
trips. State television lavished Putin with daily coverage,
boosting his chances.

<HEADLINE> Thefts, Stumbles Lead To Oscar Jokes  </HEADLINE>
By LYNN ELBER, AP Television Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The series of missteps and strange twists
leading to this year's Academy Awards presentation, including the
theft of Oscar statuettes, turned into comedy gold Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   Willie Fulgear, the man who found 52 of the 55 missing Oscars in
a trash bin, was introduced from the audience by host Billy
Crystal, who noted Fulgear received $50,000 in reward money.
</P>
<P>
   ''Which is not a lot of money, when you realize Miramax and
DreamWorks are spending millions of dollars just to get one,''
Crystal said, alluding to the studios waging expensive promotional
campaigns for their leading Oscar contenders, ''The Cider House
Rules'' and ''American Beauty.''
</P>
<P>
   Crystal also couldn't resist noting that the other awards
remained missing.
</P>
<P>
   ''They searched Erykah Badu's hat, and they found one of the
missing Oscars,'' Crystal said, referring to the singer's
Cat-in-the-Hat style headwrap. ''So only two more to go.''
</P>
<P>
   The host didn't stop there. After bantering with Jack Nicholson,
Crystal said: ''Jack has three Oscars. Which is no big deal,
because so does some guy in Bell,'' referring to the Los Angeles
suburb from which the statuettes were stolen.
</P>
<P>
   Later in the show, the comedian lumbered to the microphone
carrying a see-through sack of oranges hiding two Oscar statuettes
inside.
</P>
<P>
   ''We found the other two Oscars,'' he said. ''Somebody bought
these coming off the Santa Monica freeway on an offramp -- $3.99.
This is a bargain.''
</P>
<P>
   Bell also is where 4,000 misdirected Oscar ballots turned up
earlier this month, after they were mistaken for third-class mail.
The mix-up forced the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences
to mail new ones and extend its voting deadline.
</P>
<P>
   The latest irritation to the academy came Friday, when The Wall
Street Journal polled 356 of the 5,607 voting members and published
a list of projected Oscar winners.
</P>
<P>
   Crystal, citing the newspaper's predictions, assured the
audience that the Oscar winners are the best-kept secret in
America, ''with the possible exception of what George W. Bush did
in the '70s.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a reference to whether the Republican presidential
candidate used drugs in his youth. Bush has acknowledged an earlier
drinking problem but has refused to answer specific questions about
past drug use.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the turmoil of the past few weeks, the ceremony itself
went smoothly and Oscar officials appeared relaxed.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Rehme, president of the academy, even tried schtick. The
Oscar focus, he said, had shifted from who would win to ''what in
the world are we going to present them with?''

<HEADLINE> Oscar Finder Low-Key at Awards  </HEADLINE>
By ANTHONY BREZNICAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) --The junkman-savior of 52 stolen Oscars has
gone from litter to glitterati in one week.
</P>
<P>
   Willie Fulgear, donning a black top-hat with his tuxedo, smiled
and waved to the crowd when host Billy Crystal introduced him at
the start of the show.
</P>
<P>
   Crystal pointed out that Fulgear was given a $50,000 reward for
finding the Oscars.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's not a lot of money when you figure Miramax and
Dreamworks are spending millions of dollars to get one,'' Crystal
quipped.
</P>
<P>
   The 61-year-old Koreatown resident found the purloined
statuettes stacked beside a trash bin about a block from his home.
</P>
<P>
   Fulgear, planning to move from his one-room apartment, said he
was rummaging through the garbage for packing boxes when he made
his golden find.
</P>
<P>
   A self-described ''poor man,'' Fulgear said he intended to use
the reward as a down payment on a house.
</P>
<P>
   Once investigators were certain he had nothing to do with the
theft of the missing Oscars, Fulgear got his other reward: two
invitations to Sunday's awards show.
</P>
<P>
   He took his 22-year-old son, Allen, to the black-tie event.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his background, Fulgear appeared to fit right in with
Hollywood's top celebrities.
</P>
<P>
   ''A lot of people want to know what the stars are thinking about
during the show,'' Crystal said to introduce a segment called
''What Are They Thinking?''
</P>
<P>
   When the camera showed Willie Fulgear in the audience, Crystal
imagined him thinking: ''This is cool, but what I really want to do
is direct.''

<HEADLINE> Polish Filmmaker Gets Honorary Oscar  </HEADLINE>
By CHELSEA J. CARTER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The Polish filmmaker who spent his career
maneuvering between a repressive communist government and an
audience yearning for freedom was awarded an honorary Oscar on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Andrzej Wajda, 73, whose films include the Oscar-nominated ''The
Maids of Wilko'' and ''Land of Promise,'' accepted the award ''as a
tribute to all of Polish cinema.''
</P>
<P>
   ''My fervent hope is that the only flames people will encounter
will be the great passions of the heart -- love, gratitude and
solidarity,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A resistance fighter during World War II, Wajda also used the
opportunity to thank the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ''That is why today I thank the American friends of Poland and
my compatriots for helping my country rejoin the Western
civilization, its institutions and security structures,'' he said
in Polish.
</P>
<P>
   Wajda's films never caught on with U.S. audiences, although two
have been nominated for Oscars as best foreign film: the 1975
''Land of Promise,'' a tale of lost ideals in a rush to get rich,
and the 1979 ''The Maids of Wilko'' about the inevitable demise of
love and life.
</P>
<P>
   Two of Wajda's earlier films -- ''Kanal'' in 1957 and ''Ashes and
Diamonds'' in 1958 -- drew on his experience as an anti-Nazi
resistance fighter. They portray his generation's struggle to
preserve patriotic values after surviving the Nazis only to fall
under Soviet domination.
</P>
<P>
   Despite communist censorship, he sought to help shape the social
struggle that led to Solidarity, the trade union that eventually
helped topple communist rule.
</P>
<P>
   Among his successes of that era were ''Man of Marble'' and its
1981 sequel, ''Man of Iron,'' about the disillusionment of a father
and son under the communist system.
</P>
<P>
   ''Man of Iron'' won the Cannes Film Festival's Golden Palm that
year, but the communists banned the film and withdrew it from Oscar
competition when they imposed martial law in 1981.
</P>
<P>
   After communism fell in 1989, Wajda said, his films became ''an
attempt to rediscover this part of Polish culture that has been
concealed for years.'' They included ''Korczak,'' about a Polish
Jewish teacher who died in Nazi gas chambers, and ''Easter Week,''
about Polish attitudes toward the uprising in Warsaw's Jewish
ghetto in 1943.
</P>
<P>
   Both were snubbed by Poles who preferred the flashier Hollywood
films. Wajda denounced the audience as ''either absorbed in itself
or entertainment'' and he considered giving up films.
</P>
<P>
   But this year, Wajda returned triumphantly to the screen with
''Mr. Tadeusz,'' a sweeping adaptation of poet Adam Mickiewicz's
verse-novel about life, love and intrigue among Polish nobility.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Watching Putin Closely  </HEADLINE>
By WILLIAM C. MANN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Russians clearly want a more ordered society,
and the United States is watching closely to see how former KGB
officer Vladimir Putin tries to bring it about as president,
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ''The question is whether it's order with a small or a capital
'O,''' she said on CBS' ''Face the Nation'' from Geneva, where
President Clinton met with Syria's leader.
</P>
<P>
   ''None of us would like to see order with a capital 'O.' But one
can understand why the Russians, after a certain chaotic period,
would like to see some greater order in their lives,'' Albright
said.
</P>
<P>
   Appearing on CNN's ''Late Edition,'' she added: ''We have to
obviously watch his actions.''
</P>
<P>
   In elections Sunday, the 47-year-old Putin, the acting
president, was winning 52.4 percent of the vote with 93 percent of
the returns counted, apparently enough to give him an outright
victory despite a stronger-than-expected showing by Russia's
revived Communist Party that threatened to push him into an April
16 runoff. Either way, Putin's eventual victory was considered
almost certain.
</P>
<P>
   Alluding to Putin's ties to the former Soviet secret police,
Albright said others ''have to stop the psychobabble'' about the
Russian leader. But she made clear that the Clinton administration
is wary of just how far he would go toward strong-arming Russia's
disordered post-communist society into submission.
</P>
<P>
   A big reason is the brutally suppressed rebellion in the
Caucasus region Chechnya. Many analysts say Putin's tactics there
helped drive his election success.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've made quite clear to him that the Russian way of
proceeding (in Chechnya) is of great concern to us,'' Albright said
on CBS.
</P>
<P>
   But she said Putin ''has in many of his conversations with us
indicated that there are lots of things to work with him on'' such
as economic reform and arms control. Albright said she is not ready
to make a judgment about his commitment to democracy.
</P>
<P>
   ''Certainly he uses all the right vocabulary when he talks about
needing the vote of the people. And it is historic that the
Russians are having such an election, transfer of power in a
constitutional and democratic way,'' she said on CNN.
</P>
<P>
   ''His words are OK, but we have to watch his actions.''
</P>
<P>
   Members of Congress expressed similar uncertainty about Russia's
prospects under Putin.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Christopher Cox, R-Calif., chairman of Speaker Dennis
Hastert's special advisory group on Russia, was in Moscow to
monitor the voting.
</P>
<P>
   Putin ''is said to be a law-and-order candidate. That's an
interesting selection of words,'' Cox said on CNN. ''Will it be law
supporting order, or just the order part?''
</P>
<P>
   Americans must remember, Cox said, that ''the United States has
to take things as we find them, not as we want them to be.''
</P>
<P>
   ''He's an enigma,'' Sen. Trent Lott, the Senate majority leader,
said on NBC's ''Meet the Press.'' ''He seems to be moving toward
... opening up and some reforms, and yet there is a throwback
quality that's got to worry us.''
</P>
<P>
   Lott, R-Miss., said ''some of the tactics sound to me like old
KGB tactics,'' especially Putin's apparent manipulation of Russian
news media.
</P>
<P>
   ''But he's young,'' Lott said. ''He may be a very pleasant
surprise.''

<HEADLINE> Mighty Ducks 4, Coyotes 3, OT  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. (AP) -- Oleg Tverdovsky scored with 1:13 left in
overtime as the Anaheim Mighty Ducks rallied from two goals down
and kept their playoff hopes alive Sunday night with a 4-3 victory
over the Phoenix Coyotes.
</P>
<P>
   Teemu Selanne scored twice and Fredrik Olausson got the tying
goal on a power play early in the third period, helping the Ducks
climb within two points of Phoenix, San Jose and Edmonton for the
eighth and final Western Conference playoff berth.
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix goalie Sean Burke, who made 37 saves, stopped all four
shots during an overtime power play after Lyle Odelein was sent off
for holding Matt Cullen at 1:44.
</P>
<P>
   But Tverdovsky, who returned to the Ducks this season in a
draft-day trade with the Coyotes, used Benoit Hogue as a screen and
one-timed a pass from Cullen to beat Burke for his 15th goal. It
extended Phoenix' losing streak to seven games -- the longest since
the franchise moved from Winnipeg in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Hogue, Greg Adams and rookie Trevor Letowski all scored in the
first period for Phoenix. The Coyotes played without captain Keith
Tkachuk, who finished the two-game suspension he received for
high-sticking Colorado defenseman Aaron Miller on March 23.
</P>
<P>
   Anaheim goalie Guy Hebert -- yanked after surrendering five goals
on 24 shots in the first two periods of Friday night's loss at
Vancouver -- was beaten on three of the Coyotes' first 13 shots.
</P>
<P>
   The next one -- a bullet by Hogue with 1:06 left in the opening
period -- struck Hebert flush on the mask and left him dazed for
several moments. But he stayed in the game and stopped the Coyotes'
final 11 shots to finish with 21 saves.
</P>
<P>
   Selanne narrowed the gap to 3-2 at 3:48 of the second with his
30th goal and second of the game. It was the sixth time Selanne
reached the 30-goal mark in his eight NHL seasons.
</P>
<P>
   The Ducks, 9-for-34 on the power play in seven games, tied it
after Teppo Numminen was sent off for holding Selanne in front of
the Phoenix net 13 seconds into the third. Paul Kariya threaded a
cross-ice pass under Odelein's stick, and Olausson beat Burke
between the pads from the right of the crease.
</P>
<P>
   Selanne was deprived of the game-winner -- and his 17th career
hat trick -- with 25 seconds left in regulation. Burke slid across
the crease to rob him after Kariya set up Selanne with a perfect
pass from behind the net.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Can't Sway Assad on Talks  </HEADLINE>
By TERENCE HUNT, AP White House Correspondent
<TEXT>
<P>
   GENEVA (AP) -- President Clinton and Syrian President Hafez Assad
failed during three hours of face-to-face negotiations Sunday to
nail down an agreement to restart negotiations between Israel and
Syria for a landmark peace treaty.
</P>
<P>
   ''The differences are significant and important and obviously
more work needs to be done to bridge them,'' White House spokesman
Joe Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
   He characterized the meeting between Clinton and Assad -- their
first face-to-face summit in six years-- as ''very useful.'' But at
the same time, he said, ''We don't believe it would be productive''
for Syrian-Israeli talks to resume at this point.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is impossible to predict when those talks might resume,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart said Assad ''articulated his position clearly and
forcefully'' throughout two businesslike sessions. Clinton spoke to
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak both before and after the Assad
meeting, Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
   Syrian presidential spokesman Jubran Kourieh said that during
the talks Assad stressed the importance of Syria's long demand for
an Israeli pullback to the country's 1967 borders.
</P>
<P>
   ''Since yesterday nothing earth-shattering happened in the peace
process,'' Kourieh said afterward.
</P>
<P>
   The summit discussed pending issues and the peace process and
the ''obstacles that Israel has put up and is still putting up,''
Kourieh said.
</P>
<P>
   In Jerusalem, Deputy Defense Minister Ephraim Sneh said in a
telephone interview that the main sticking point in Geneva was
Syria's demand for a prior commitment to cede the strategic Golan
Heights plateau.
</P>

   ''The fact that Syria insists upon dictating an agreement and
not obtaining an agreed-upon agreement is what made the resumption
of the talks impossible,'' Sneh said. ''They are quite intransigent
about what they are supposed to give in terms of security
arrangements and they have different ideas about normalization.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton left Geneva shortly after the meeting broke up, leaving
Lockhart behind to speak to reporters. The president arrived back
in Washington shortly before midnight.
</P>
<P>
   The spokesman said the United States will continue to mediate
between Israel and Syria and that both sides are committed to
reaching peace.
</P>
<P>
   ''In our judgment it is not worthwhile to have meetings just to
have meetings,'' Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
   Expectations had been high going into the negotiations, in part
simply because the 69-year-old Assad, who rarely travels, made a
special trip to Switzerland to see Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   But as the day wore into evening, hopes diminished that the
talks at a luxury hotel overlooking Lake Geneva would produce an
agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Officials suggested that it was unlikely that any kind of
formula could be announced for another round of talks until, at
least, Clinton had a chance to talk to Egyptian President Hosni
Mubarak.
</P>
<P>
   Mubarak, a key figure in all peace negotiations in the region,
had a scheduled meeting with Clinton in Washington on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Clinton's Mideast envoy, Dennis Ross, was headed back
to Israel to brief Barak on the talks.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton mediated Israeli-Syrian talks in Shepherdstown, W.Va.,
which broke off in January. The president has been working
intensely for their resumption. Time is running out on Clinton's
presidency and his hopes to polish his legacy with a historic
Mideast deal.
</P>
<P>
   The outlines of an agreement already are well known -- a return
of the Golan Heights to Syria in exchange for security guarantees
for Israel and normalization of relations. Peace in Lebanon would
follow any agreement with Syria, which controls its neighbor's
military, politics and economy.
</P>
<P>
   But the two sides still have to agree on how far Israel
withdraws from the Golan, security arrangements, water rights from
territory Israel surrenders and normalization of relations.
</P>
<P>
   Barak has made a peace deal with Syria a top priority of his
administration. But Israelis want concrete assurances of what they
would get in return. Israel captured the Golan in the 1967 Mideast
War, defended the territory in a bloody war in 1973 and annexed it
in 1981.
</P>
<P>
   Barak, in an interview on ABC's ''This Week,'' predicted before
the Geneva talks began that they would indicate ''from this highest
level of leadership in Syria ... whether we will have real peace.''
</P>
<P>
   He said Clinton knows the demands of both Israel and Syria.
''The only question that remains is whether those needs could be
brought together in a deal,'' Barak said. ''Tough decisions on both
sides'' are required.
</P>
<P>
   In Syria, the state-run Syria Times said the summit provided an
opportunity to reveal how much U.S. efforts ''have nudged the
conditions for productive talks into place.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and Assad held two summits in 1994, in Damascus and
Geneva. They also saw each other briefly at the funeral of Jordan's
King Hussein in February 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The two sides talked for more than two hours, took a two-hour
break, and then resumed the meeting, Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and national security
adviser Sandy Berger accompanied Clinton into the meeting, along
with chief of staff John Podesta, Ross, and another aide.
</P>
<P>
   Assad was accompanied by Foreign Minister Farouk al-Shaara,
Abdul Raouf al-Qasem, head of the National Security Office, and a
legal adviser.
</P>
<P>
   In separate interviews broadcast Sunday on ABC, Jordan's King
Abdullah II and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat each expressed
hope for success in Geneva.
</P>
<P>
   ''I believe this is the golden opportunity for the Israelis and
Syrians to achieve some sort of peace,'' Abdullah said.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat, who is engaged in his own fitful peace negotiations with
Israel, said he hoped progress on a deal between Israel and Syria
will generate momentum for a deal with the Palestinians. The United
States had acted as host and go-between in that process, as well.
</P>
<P>
   Assad has not attended any of the Syrian-Israeli negotiating
sessions that have been proceeding in fits and starts since the
process began in 1991. Shaara headed the Syrian delegation to the
Shepherdstown talks while Barak led the Israeli side.
