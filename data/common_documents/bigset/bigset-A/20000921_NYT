EDITORIAL: SPEEDIER TRAINS

<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Thursday, Sept. 21:
</P>
<P>
   On days when gridlock paralyzed Newark International Airport
this year, Continental Airlines resorted to putting some of its
short-flight passengers on Amtrak trains. Such pragmatic
improvisation made sense, but also raises the question why anyone
would choose to fly from Newark to Baltimore or Providence in the
first place. At a time when the nation's air traffic system is
strained to its very limits, it is a question gaining added
urgency.
</P>
<P>
   Congress could enhance Amtrak's ability to ease the burden on
the nation's congested skies and highways by passing the High Speed
Rail Investment Act before it adjourns next month. The bill would
enable Amtrak to issue $10 billion in bonds over the next decade
for capital expenditures in designated high-speed rail corridors.
States would provide some matching funds and bondholders would be
paid in tax credits, at a cost to taxpayers of $3.3 billion over 10
years.
</P>
<P>
   Though it had its best summer ever this year, and says it will
attain operational self-sufficiency by 2003 as required by
Congress, Amtrak is partly to blame for the continued skepticism
facing rail travel. Its failure last fall to launch the Acela
Express service between New York City and Boston on schedule
deprived high-speed rail boosters of a working success to justify
investment in other high-speed corridors. Amtrak did cut the trip
down to four hours from five, but delayed the introduction of the
sleek new trains that will travel at speeds of up to 150 miles per
hour.
</P>
<P>
   That service is now expected to begin within the next two months
and should cut the trip down to three hours, the length at which
downtown-to-downtown train service becomes preferable to
negotiating congested airports, as evidenced by Amtrak's service to
Washington. Amtrak commands twice as large a market share on that
route as it does on the longer run to Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Eighteen of the 20 most congested airports nationwide are in
cities on designated high-speed rail corridors. The time has come
for Congress and transportation officials to promote high-speed
rail service as a means of alleviating air traffic congestion.

BOHLANDER WON'T DUCK CHANCE TO PLAY NEAR HOME
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BILLY WITZ  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The most anonymous place on the football field is
the offensive line. But it won't be a refuge Saturday for UCLA
offensive tackle Bryce Bohlander.
</P>
<P>
   When 42,000 fans pack themselves into cozy Autzen Stadium, they
won't have trouble picking out Bohlander. A native of Keizer, Ore.,
an hour north of Eugene, Bohlander was the state's top college
prospect two years ago and all but a lock to attend Oregon.
</P>
<P>
   When he surprised even his parents by choosing UCLA, the fallout
was swift. As far as people in Oregon are concerned, he's just
another reason to hate California. Come Saturday, his name might as
well be Boo-lander.
</P>
<P>
   ``It'll be fun,'' a smiling Bohlander said of his return. ``It's
going to be interesting. I'm sure I'll hear about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Bohlander, a sophomore who has started five consecutive games at
left tackle, has more than lived up to the hype that accompanied
his high school career at McNary High in Keizer, a town of 35,000
adjacent to the state capital, Salem.
</P>
<P>
   He was a Parade All-American, the consensus top offensive
lineman on the West Coast, and SuperPrep rated him as the nation's
No. 3 offensive line prospect.
</P>
<P>
   There also wasn't much debate on where he'd go to school.
</P>
<P>
   Oregon coach Mike Bellotti was in the Bohlanders' home at 8 a.m.
on the first day coaches could pay home visits, and even UCLA's
director of football operations, Randy Taylor, concedes he thought
the Bruins were a long shot to land Bohlander, along with USC,
Washington, Purdue and Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   But a recruiting visit to UCLA in mid-January, less then three
weeks before signing day, convinced Bohlander. Suddenly, he wanted
to go away.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if they took him to the Baywatch babes audition
or what,'' Bellotti said. ``It was a huge disappointment. He was
one of the best players in the state and obviously by starting as a
true freshman, I think he's proved that he can play at this level.
I think it was one of those deals where, unfortunately, we might
have been too close to home.''
</P>
<P>
   What would this quiet, studious kid who loves hunting and
fishing find so appealing about Los Angeles?
</P>
<P>
   ``We were surprised,'' said John Bohlander, Bryce's father and a
vice principal at McNary. ``He got excited when somebody tells him
there's a catch-and-release trout stream by Magic Mountain.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he was impressed with the setting of the school and
the other thing that swayed him was when he went out with the
players, he liked how they got along with one another. He was kind
of looking at us like, 'Where would you like me to go?' We said,
`We want you to go wherever you're comfortable.' We were pretty
proud that he came up with his own decision. The easy out was going
to Oregon. The sure bet would be to go to a place that's 60 miles
away.''
</P>
<P>
   Particularly, when that's what they're expecting.
</P>
<P>
   Bohlander was getting the squeeze from his friends, from Oregon
alumni and even relatives. His cousin, Don Essig, is the
public-address announcer at Autzen Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``Through recruiting, he'd say how neat it would be to announce
my name,'' said Bohlander, an economics major. ``I had friends who
would say, 'Yeah, it sure would be nice for you to stay home.'
</P>
<P>
   ``There was also pressure because nobody ever leaves Oregon.
There aren't a whole lot of Division I players in the state and
there's the expectation that you're going to play for the Ducks or
the Beavers. In my class, there were 10 or 12 guys and that's a big
class. I felt a lot of pressure to stay.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the real pressure came last year when Bohlander, who
was expecting to redshirt, was told during fall camp that he'd
play.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a big step from playing in Salem, Oregon, to playing at
the Rose Bowl,'' UCLA line coach Mark Weber said. ``Then in his
second game, he's playing against Ohio State at the Horseshoe. It's
a big step, emotionally and physically.''
</P>
<P>
   Bohlander played as a reserve most of the season, but injuries
pressed him into the starting lineup in season-ending games against
Washington and USC. The only UCLA lineman to start more games as a
first-year freshman is Jonathan Ogden, who would go on to win the
Outland Trophy in 1995 and who is now the NFL's highest-paid
lineman.
</P>
<P>
   Bohlander, who is 6-foot-6 and 288 pounds, gained more than 20
pounds in the offseason and benefits by playing next to senior
guard Oscar Cabrera, a captain and three-year starter.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's still young and makes his share of mistakes, but he plays
hard, he's athletic and he has a good handle on the offense,''
Weber said. ``His best days are ahead of him.''
</P>
<P>
   Including, he hopes, Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Bohlander returned home last season when UCLA played Oregon
State, and it wasn't pleasant. The Bruins lost 55-7 and Bohlander
took a verbal beating from hecklers during warmups and the game.
</P>
<P>
   His parents will be among a group of 15-20 friends and relatives
at the game Saturday, but there won't be too many others happy to
see Bohlander.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've talked to him a little bit,'' John Bohlander said. ``I
said, 'Bryce, you're probably not going to get a hero's welcome.'
''

VALENTINE WANTS TO GET A DO-OVER 
</HEADLINE>
   By TYLER KEPNER    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ After a humbling loss Tuesday night, Mets Manager
Bobby Valentine scolded his players for their lackluster play this
month. On Wednesday, he put the responsibility on himself,
suggesting for the second year in a row that he should not return
as manager if the Mets somehow miss the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we don't make the playoffs, I'll gladly take Fred off the
hook, if we have to get into that nonsense again,'' Valentine said,
referring to the Mets' co-owner, Fred Wilpon.
</P>
<P>
   Minutes later, when pressed by reporters, Valentine backed off
that statement. ``I got to retract that silly thing I said here,''
he said. ``I cut to the chase and jumped to a conclusion that
someone was going to ask it.''
</P>
<P>
   Late last September, as the Mets suddenly crumbled and their
comfortable four-game wild-card lead vanished, Valentine stated
that he should be fired if the Mets did not reach the postseason.
Wilpon backed Valentine then, although he did not extend
Valentine's contract, which expires after this season. The Mets
recovered and reached the National League Championship Series.
</P>
<P>
   Wilpon has maintained he will make no decisions on Valentine's
future until after this season, though he said on Aug. 31 that he
shared Valentine's ``good feeling'' that he would return next year.
The Mets led the National League East that day, but their 6-12
record this month has dropped them four games behind the Atlanta
Braves after Wednesday night's 6-3 victory, and, for the third
straight season, raised questions about why the Mets stumble so
severely in September with so much at stake.
</P>
<P>
   After Wednesday night's game against Atlanta, the Mets held a
five and half-game lead for the wild-card spot and Wilpon said on
Wednesday that he still believed in Valentine.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to focus on the games, and right now, we're in a
slump, no question,'' Wilpon said. ``But I have a lot of confidence
in Steve and Bobby and in all of our coaches and players, and I
think they're going to turn it around. We'll look back on it as a
slump, and therefore we'll get to where we want to get to. I'm very
optimistic.''
</P>
<P>
   Steve Phillips, the Mets' general manager, who is also in the
last year of his contract, was not in Atlanta Wednesday, but
through a team spokesman he declined comment on Valentine's
remarks. But Wilpon said, ``Steve has indicated he'd like Bobby to
return as manager.''
</P>
<P>
   Valentine said Phillips conveyed that wish to him in a telephone
conversation this morning. Wednesday's pregame interview was
conducted in the manager's office in the visiting clubhouse, where
Valentine had been combative and tense during Tuesday's postgame
session, after the Braves had routed the Mets. It was the 11th
straight time that they have lost a September or October game at
Turner Field. He was relaxed Wednesday, though sarcastic, when his
future was mentioned.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh yeah, I'd rather have it about me, absolutely, please do,''
he said. ``It's just, again and again, it's the same old thing. If
the team's going good, I know who it's about, and when they're not
going good, I know who it's about. It's not going good, so let's
make it about me.''
</P>
<P>
   Valentine then asked repeatedly for the other side of the
argument, for what would happen if the Mets make the playoffs.
``What is the flip side?'' he said. ``Play it for me, so I can hear
the music.''

GOVERNMENT CLEARED IN DEATHS AT WACO 
</HEADLINE>
   By JIM YARDLEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ A federal judge Wednesday dismissed the wrongful death
civil lawsuit brought by Branch Davidians, clearing the government
of any wrongdoing in the deaths of about 80 members of the
religious sect during the disastrous 1993 standoff at the group's
compound near Waco, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   The judge, Walter Smith Jr. of U.S. District Court in Waco,
issued an order that found that federal agents had acted legally
and could not be held liable for the deaths. His ruling ended a
legal battle that lasted nearly seven years and came after an
advisory jury in the case and a special counsel, former Sen. John
C. Danforth, both issued similar findings in July.
</P>
<P>
   The Associated Press reported that Smith wrote in his order that
no Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms agents ``fired any shot
nor used any force against residents of the compound and the
Davidians that was unprovoked.''
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, Deputy Attorney General Eric H. Holder issued a
statement: ``We are pleased with Wednesday's ruling. Like the
special counsel before it, the court reaffirmed the fact that David
Koresh and certain Branch Davidians were responsible for the
tragedy at Waco.''
</P>
<P>
   The director of the FBI, Louis J. Freeh, whose agents were
accused of causing the deaths of the Branch Davidians, called the
ruling gratifying.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the agents in both agencies have for seven long years
carried the heavy personal burden those unfounded allegations
placed upon them,'' Freeh said in a statement. ``For them and their
families, I am grateful the court and the judge laid the blame
squarely on the Davidians.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Caddell, the lead lawyer for the survivors and relatives
of the Branch Davidians, could not be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   In July, the government won two definitive victories.
</P>
<P>
   First, a jury serving as an advisory panel to Smith deliberated
for less than two hours before finding that federal agents did not
use excessive force on Feb. 28, 1993, when ATF agents attempted to
arrest Branch Davidian leader David Koresh on weapons charges.
</P>
<P>
   The ensuing gun battle left four agents and six Davidians dead
and began a 51-day standoff.
</P>
<P>
   The standoff ended on April 19, 1993, when FBI agents used
armored vehicles to pump tear gas into the compound hours before
the wooden structure burned to the ground. The advisory jury also
cleared the bureau of any wrongdoing on that final day.
</P>
<P>
   Second, a week after the jury's verdict, Danforth, the special
counsel appointed by Attorney General Janet Reno to re-examine the
incident, announced a sweeping report that also exonerated the
government.

PARKS PLEDGES LAPD COOPERATION WITH MONITOR &HT;    (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ALEXA HAUSSLER 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
 &LR;
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Despite his earlier predictions that a federal
consent decree could hamper law enforcement efforts and crush
officer morale, Los Angeles Police Chief Bernard C. Parks said
Wednesday that the department will ``enthusiastically'' carry out
the reforms in an agreement accepted a day earlier by the City
Council.
</P>
<P>
   ``The council has spoken and we will be guided by whatever the
document is in its final form,'' Parks said. ``We are not going to
drag our feet in our commitment.''
</P>
<P>
   The Los Angeles City Council agreed Tuesday to enter into a
legally binding agreement, known as a consent decree, with the U.S.
Department of Justice. The deal would include a host of police
reforms to be implemented under the supervision of a federal
monitor.
</P>
<P>
   The reforms -- subject to final approval by federal and city
negotiators -- range from recording the race of individuals stopped
by police officers to determine whether racial profiling occurs, to
installing a computerized system for tracking complaints against
individual officers.
</P>
<P>
   Parks said department staff members, in a meeting Tuesday to
discuss the consent decree, agreed to ``diligently attempt to
implement it.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, police union and community leaders reacted with
hesitation to the agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Ted Hunt, president of the Los Angeles Police Protective League,
which represents LAPD officers, said the council's vote occurred
too early.
</P>
<P>
   ``The opinions of the public and the rank-and-file police
haven't been considered. They are putting the cart before the
horse,'' Hunt said. ``I believe we need consensus before a consent
decree.''
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's vote follows months of negotiations between city and
Justice Department officials, who have threatened to file a lawsuit
against the city for what they call a pattern of police misconduct
and civil rights violations.
</P>
<P>
   Federal officials have been pushing for the consent decree -- a
police reform tool being used in a handful of other U.S. cities --
because they said Los Angeles failed to implement reforms suggested
by the Christopher Commission after the Rodney King beating case.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know that there are some problems with the LAPD and I
believe there should be some kind of reforms. But I'm apprehensive
about the federal government injecting itself into our local law
enforcement problems,'' said Brendan Breslin, a volunteer police
community representative for the Neighborhood Watch program in Van
Nuys.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want them coming down here and mandating that we do
things that could adversely affect our department,'' Breslin said.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon Murley, president of the Woodland Hills Homeowners
Organization, also expressed doubts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We should have never reached this point, had the mayor and the
City Council and the Police Commission done what they were supposed
to do and done what the Christopher Commission came up with,''
Murley said. ``It won't be the solution to it, though, because the
federal government has screwed up everything they've ever touched.
So I don't know where it's going to go, honestly.''

PILOTS AT AMERICAN REJECT EARLY EXTENSION OF CONTRACT 
</HEADLINE>
   (SUBS to correct spelling from Crate to Carty in 2nd graf.)  
 By LAURENCE ZUCKERMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Pilots at American Airlines overwhelmingly rejected a one-year
contract extension Wednesday, dealing a blow to the airline's
efforts to improve relations with one of its most critical employee
groups.
</P>
<P>
   About 66 percent of the 8,200 pilots who participated in the
vote cast ballots against the agreement. The result is a setback
for both Donald J. Carty, the chief executive of the AMR Corp., the
parent of American, and Richard T. LaVoy and Brian A. Mayhew,
president and vice president of the Allied Pilots Association. All
three men had enthusiastically hailed the contract extension, which
was announced in July, as the foundation of a new relationship
between the airline and union.
</P>
<P>
   Past strains between the two sides led pilots to stage an
extensive sickout in early 1999, forcing American to cancel 6,700
flights and disrupting travel for tens of thousands of passengers.
Two years earlier, the union went out on strike but was immediately
forced back to work by President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The chances of the agreement's being accepted plunged in late
August when pilots at United Airlines, which is the biggest airline
in the country, followed by American, negotiated a contract that
raised wages as much as 28 percent and greatly increased retirement
benefits. Several of the American union's board members who had
initially endorsed the agreement changed their minds and urged
pilots to vote against it after the United contract was announced.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's result means that the union and the company will
begin negotiating a new contract next June, just before the current
agreement comes up for renewal. The rejected deal would have
extended the contract until Aug. 31, 2002. It also means that
American Eagle, American's commuter subsidiary, is restricted to
flying just 67 regional jets with 45 seats or more, while other
airlines have much more flexibility.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, Carty tried to put a positive spin on
Wednesday's defeat. ``The talks that led to this agreement are
proof positive that American and the Allied Pilots Association can
work together constructively, and we will continue to work on
improving our relationship,'' he said. Last week in New York he
told Wall Street analysts that he expected a no vote because of the
United contract and that the company would not suffer financially
as a result.
</P>
<P>
   LaVoy, the union president, was fatalistic. ``You've got to
respect the membership's wishes,'' he said in a telephone
interview. ``It was never a slam dunk anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   The deal would have allowed American Eagle to fly hundreds of
50-seat regional jets virtually anywhere in the country. It would
also have forced pilots to spend more time flying a single type of
jet, like a Boeing 737, before moving up to a bigger aircraft,
reducing the airline's training costs.
</P>
<P>
   In exchange, American pilots were to receive a 3 percent wage
increase and the promise that AMR would expand the airline,
creating more opportunities for pilots to move up the ranks. The
company also agreed to forgive the $45.5 million fine that a
federal judge ordered the union to pay the airline as a result of
the 1999 sickout. The deal was controversial within the union from
the beginning. A group of pilots calling themselves PACE, or Pilots
Against Contract Extension, set up a Web site to promote their
objections and campaigned hard to defeat the deal.
</P>
<P>
   The group asserted that the extension was negotiated in secret
by LaVoy and Mayhew. The two men were also the only individuals
named in the $45.5 million fine, leading PACE to question the
objectivity of their endorsement.
</P>
<P>
   Mayhew said Wednesday that it was unfortunate that the contempt
fine was tied to contractual issues in the extension. But he added
that he did not believe that that was a decisive issue because it
was clear that the company was always going to forgive the fine.
``It's a matter of when it gets settled, not if it gets settled,''
he said.

EDITORIAL: SPAIN'S BATTLE AGAINST TERRORISM 
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Thursday, Sept. 21:
</P>
<P>
   In a series of raids conducted in both Spain and France in the
past week, authorities arrested more than 36 alleged separatist
Basque ETA terrorists, including the man presumed to be their top
leader. This is a victory not only for Prime Minister Jose Maria
Aznar of Spain, but for the Basque people themselves. They have had
to bear the burden of the ETA's senseless terror.
</P>
<P>
   The group was founded during the four-decade rule of Francisco
Franco, when the Spanish state brutally repressed all
manifestations of Basque culture. But Spain is now a vibrant
democracy, affording the Basques a great deal of autonomy. This
leaves little room for a liberation movement espousing violence,
and the ETA has reacted to its political isolation with increased
desperation.
</P>
<P>
   The ETA's terror campaign provides the one asterisk to Spain's
recent success story. The nation has become a constructive force in
NATO and the European Union, and its economy has created more jobs
than the rest of the European Union nations combined in the past
three years. But with the cease-fire in Northern Ireland, the ETA
is Western Europe's most active armed separatist group.
</P>
<P>
   Late in 1998, frustrated by Basques' contentment with their
place in Spain, the ETA declared a unilateral cease-fire. Aznar,
himself a survivor of an ETA assassination attempt, would not
negotiate with the group without its formal surrender.
</P>
<P>
   Early this year the ETA resumed its campaign of terror. It is
charged with killing 12 people so far this year, mostly
politicians. Aznar insists that the struggle against the ETA not
subvert the rule of law. The previous Socialist government was
voted out of office partly because of revelations that it had waged
a ``dirty war'' against the ETA. Spain must brace itself for the
possibility of further ETA attacks. In doing so, Aznar should
maintain his sense of equanimity and respect for the rule of law.

<P>
   BURBANK _ The Walt Disney Co. announced a shake-up Wednesday in
its struggling consumer products division, saying that longtime
partner Mattel Inc. would no longer handle toys and games based on
modern movie characters.
</P>
<P>
   A Disney partner for about 45 years, El Segundo-based Mattel
will continue to produce toys, dolls, games and puzzles based on
classic Disney characters like Mickey Mouse, Winnie the Pooh and
Donald Duck through its Fisher-Price subsidiary.
</P>
<P>
   But Hasbro Inc., having successfully marketed ``Jurassic Park''
and ``Star Wars'' action figures, will take over toys and games
related to future Disney films and develop new products based on
Disney's theme parks.
</P>
<P>
   ``They recognized that our expertise is in marketing
entertainment properties,'' said Wayne Charness, a senior vice
president for Hasbro, based in Pawtucket, R.I. ``You're going to
see Hasbro and our various companies making toys and games related
to some of the great upcoming movies and TV shows Disney will come
up with.''
</P>
<P>
   Annual operating revenue in Disney's consumer products division
dropped 48 percent to $59 million, dipping 11 percent in just the
last quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The company blamed declines in worldwide merchandise licensing
and rising costs for advertising and retailing.
</P>
<P>
   The licensing agreements announced Wednesday are aimed at
turning that business around, said John Singh, spokesman for
Disney's consumer products division.
</P>
<P>
   ``Instead of putting all our eggs in one basket, we will divide
them where it makes sense and continue a very strong relationship
with Mattel while developing a new relationship with Hasbro,''
Singh said.
</P>
<P>
   Mattel first partnered with Disney in the 1950s as a sponsor of
``The Mickey Mouse Club.'' More recently, it was the media giant's
lead toy licensee for all standard characters.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, Mattel has made about 80 percent of Disney's toys,
both classic and modern, and it will continue to make those classic
characters as well as products for the infant and preschool market,
where it is the leading brand in the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mattel is thrilled to be able to continue our licensing
relationship with Disney, as Disney has been one of the
cornerstones of the preschool line. The imagination and fun that
Disney brings to children's entertainment is easily translated into
engaging toys for children,'' said Neil Friedman, president of
Fisher-Price Brands.
</P>
<P>
   Disney has worked with Hasbro before on a few projects, such as
products based on the studio's successful ``Toy Story'' movies and
some games in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   The first fruits of the multiyear licensing deal between Hasbro
and Disney will hit store shelves next fall and be based on the
Disney/Pixar animated feature ``Monsters, Inc.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to upcoming films, the corporate alliance allows
Hasbro to develop toys based on Disney television productions and
theme parks, as well as attractions in the Disney's theme parks
based on the toymaker's classic games like Monopoly, Scrabble, Clue
and Trivial Pursuit.
</P>
<P>
   The two companies also plan to develop a 16,000-square-foot toy
store at Walt Disney World in Orlando, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   The deal covers all world markets except Japan, where Disney has
found it difficult to distribute its products without having to use
Japanese companies, said Singh.

 NEW CLUES TO WHAT LIES AT CENTER OF EARTH'S GALAXY  &HT;     By DAVID PERLMAN 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Astronomers have followed the motion of stars circling a hugely
massive black hole at the center of the Milky Way, shedding new
light on one of our galaxy's greatest mysteries.
</P>
<P>
   For decades, astronomers have theorized that a black hole must
lie at the center of the galaxy like some dark and deadly spider,
its gravity so enormous that it sucks all nearby gas and stars into
it until they disappear with a final flash of energy.
</P>
<P>
   Now, for the first time, astronomers at the University of
California at Los Angeles have precisely measured the motion of two
stars accelerating in orbit around the black hole _ much as Earth
and our planets are flying around our sun.
</P>
<P>
   The discovery allows astronomers to measure the black hole's
size and the amount of mass it contains.
</P>
<P>
   Andrea Gehz and her UCLA colleagues estimate that the black hole
at the galaxy's center, some 24,000 light-years away, must be only
about 120 million miles in diameter but at least 2.5 million times
more massive than our sun.
</P>
<P>
   The team's new evidence provides, as she says, ``the strongest
evidence'' yet that the dark object is indeed a ``supermassive
black hole'' in the center of the galaxy.
</P>
<P>
   But the Gehz team's even more remarkable finding _ published
Thursday in the journal Nature _ is the extraordinarily precise
measurements of the two stars whose acceleration they have been
observing for the past five years.
</P>
<P>
   Using the infrared detection abilities of the giant Keck
telescope atop Kauna Kea on the Big Island of Hawaii, they have
measured the speed of the two stars year by year. They are located
some 60 billion miles from the black hole and are in no danger of
being sucked into its maw, they believe.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, for example, the stars were flying at velocities of 2
million miles an hour, but by last year they had increased their
velocities by more than 1 million miles an hour, and had begun
turning _ figuratively around a corner _ into orbital flight around
the central black hole.
</P>
<P>
   By her calculations of those velocities, Gehz said, it is likely
that at least one of the stars will complete an entire orbit,
circling the black hole in only 15 years.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, John Kormendy of the University of Texas in
Austin said the stars' relatively fast orbital period was itself an
important discovery. ``It's really quite marvelous that we're
seeing something on a vast galactic scale that can be reduced to a
human scale.''
</P>
<P>
   The entire Milky Way galaxy, like a cosmic pinwheel, is rotating
constantly about its central black hole at a pace that carries it
once around every 250 million years. So when astronomers think of
watching stars near the center circling the central hub within 15
years, they are more than a little awestruck.
</P>
<P>
   Kormendy wrote in a commentary to Gehz's work, ``There is
something quite grand in the realization that we can expect, with
good health and a little luck, to see the galactic center rotate at
least once in our lifetimes.''
</P>
<P>
   There are many dark and massive objects at the centers of other
galaxies, and scientists have wondered whether they are truly black
holes or simply accretions of dead stars or failed ones that are
known as brown dwarfs.
</P>
<P>
   This one, in the heart of our own Milky Way, is most surely a
black hole, and a supermassive one at that, Gehz says. It is
actually located very close to a powerful radio source coming from
an object called Sagittarius A that some astronomers in the past
had believed to be the black hole itself.
</P>
<P>
   Gehz's measurements of the orbiting stars cleared that matter up
and sent a wave of excitement among astronomers in Gehz's field.
</P>
<P>
   At UC Berkeley, Alexei Filippenko, a noted astrophysicist who
also studies black holes, said Gehz's work provides ``exciting and
provocative'' evidence that the central black hole next to
Sagittarius A is indeed surrounded by the first stars known to
orbit the massive object.

``THE AMAZING ADVENTURES OF KAVALIER &AMP; CLAY''  
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Publication notes are at end of review.) 
 By JANET MASLIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   One night in 1939 in Brooklyn, Sammy Clayman's mother ``burst
into his bedroom, applied the ring and iron knuckles of her left
hand to the side of his cranium, and told him to move over and make
room in the bed for his cousin from Prague.'' Thus began the
partnership between Sammy and Josef Kavalier, in a meeting
terrifically auspicious not only for these two future comic book
auteurs but for Michael Chabon, the wizard who conjured them.
</P>
<P>
   With ``The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier &AMP; Clay,'' Chabon has
fashioned a big, ripe, excitingly imaginative novel and set it in
the world of his grandfather, a New York City typographer at a
plant where comics were printed. The book's world is also one of
impending crisis, with World War II looming and Joe's Jewish
parents and brother still in Czechoslovakia, from which they urged
Joe to escape. With Houdini as his hero and the Holocaust on the
horizon, Joe quickly becomes acclimated to America (``Do you like
gum?'' ``I feel I must learn to.'') and ready to use one of its
homegrown art forms as a hedge against futility, an expression of
defiance, a repository of dark humor and even a weapon of war.
</P>
<P>
   In loving if sometimes windy detail, since his great book is
buried inside a larger and more meandering one, the prodigiously
talented author of ``Wonder Boys'' leads readers into the world of
Sam and Joe's pop collaboration. ``In 1939 the American comic book,
like the beavers and cockroaches of prehistory, was larger and, in
its cumbersome way, more splendid than its modern descendant,'' he
explains, and proceeds to show us why. From the imaginations of
Kavalier, the newly Anglicized Clay and their comrades
(``ink-smirched young men, drinking, smoking, lying around with
their naked big toes protruding from the tips of their socks'')
spring a wide array of superheros, some more viable than others.
One early creation, Radio Wave, is supposed to transmit himself
through the air in his quest to right injustice. Unfortunately,
``it was soon apparent to Sammy that once they were wise to him,
all the crooks in Radio Wave's hometown need simply turn off their
radios in order to thrive unmolested.''
</P>
<P>
   In an exchange that captures the extravagantly playful
intelligence at work here, Chabon describes what happens when
Kavalier and Clay dream up a nocturnal moth-based comic-book
superheroine and present her to their boss, Shelly Anapol:
</P>
<P>
   `` `Those are very large breasts, boys.'''
</P>
<P>
   `` `We know it, Anapol,' said Sammy.''
</P>
<P>
   `` `But a moth, I don't know, it's not a popular insect. Why
can't she be a butterfly? There must be some good names there. Red,
uh, what? Red Dot . . . Bluewing . . . Pearly . . . I don't
know.'''
</P>
<P>
   `` `She can't be a  &UR; butterfly,' &LR;  said Sammy. `She's the Mistress
of the  &UR; Night. &LR; '''
</P>
<P>
   `` `That's another thing: we can't say ``mistress.'' Already I'm
getting 50 letters a week from priests and ministers. A rabbi from
Schenectady. Luna Moth. Luna Moth.' The look of incipient nausea
had come into his eyes and slack jaw. They were going to make
themselves a pile with this.''
</P>
<P>
   The team's biggest pile (most of which is appropriated by
Anapol, in a book as savvy about the business of comic books as it
is about the aesthetics) comes from the Escapist. Described as
``Houdini, but mixed with Robin Hood and a little bit of Albert
Schweitzer,'' the Escapist is the character who sends Hitler
reeling in ways that thrill the authors as much as they alarm
Anapol. ``One of these days you're going to go too far,'' Anapol
complains about Joe's drawings of wartime violence. ``Somebody is
going to get hurt.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Somebody is getting hurt already,'' Joe replies, with the
carefully understated gravity that permeates this story. Even when
Chabon is slipping deftly from realistic narrative into wittily
hyperbolic comic-book-ese, as he does to take part in the
characters' bursts of creativity each time a new character is
invented, the book's essential seriousness and thematic heft are
never diminished.
</P>
<P>
   In a cameo-studded book (Salvador Dali at a party, Orson Welles
praising the Escapist) that echoes ``Ragtime,'' just as it
sometimes suggests John Irving in fanciful mode, Chabon tells a
bustling, convoluted story in an eloquent, exceptionally precise
voice. (Dictionary-busters like ``susurrant,'' ``nystagmus'' and
``psittacosis'' readily turn up.) Joe's love affair with Rosa
Luxemburg Saks, a surrealist with ties to a Fifth Avenue department
store, is interspersed with Sammy's covert romance with a hunky
actor named Tracy Bacon. When he brings Bacon home to meet his
mother, Sammy is described as having ``the world's largest piece of
trayf in tow.''
</P>
<P>
   Integrated into these New York events is the grim shadow of
Joe's family in Europe, with his efforts to rescue his brother
constituting a major theme of the story. Joe draws the Escapist
largely as a means of raising money for little Thomas Kavalier's
own escape. But history intrudes on Joe's brotherly devotion in
ways that underscore the metaphorical value of the book's escapist
thread. ``The true magic of this broken world,'' Chabon writes
hauntingly, ``lay in the ability of the things it contained to
vanish, to become so thoroughly lost, that they might never have
existed in the first place.''
</P>
<P>
   Especially impressive about ``The Adventures of Kavalier &AMP;
Clay'' is its success in reaching for big settings (the top of the
Empire State Building), big creative leaps (``Citizen Kane'' plays
a role here) and big historical relevance without strain. Early in
the book, in Prague, that mighty figure of Hebrew lore, the golem,
is physically made part of Joe's escape from peril. Later on, in
the duo's comic book heyday, the golem becomes a prototype for
their Nazi-defeating superhero.
</P>
<P>
   And at last, when the characters' personal dramas have played
out and led them to a Levittown-like suburban setting, and one of
the cousins has ``allowed the world to wind him in the final set of
chains, and climbed, once and for all, into the cabinet of
mysteries that was the life of an ordinary man,'' the book's single
overriding image can be seen in a new light. Years after the war
and the reign of the Escapist, Rosa tells Joe: ``In 1954, I don't
think the golem makes you such an idiot anymore.''

 GORE TOUTS HIS PRESCRIPTION FOR MEDICARE  &HT;     By CARLA MARINUCCI 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SUNNYVALE, Calif. _ Battling in an increasingly aggressive
presidential race now fully focused on the issues, Vice President
Al Gore tackled prescription drug policy Wednesday, saying his GOP
opponent would protect big drug manufacturers while he alone would
ensure Americans will ``never be left at the mercy'' of insurance
companies and HMOs.
</P>
<P>
   In his final stop of a three-day California trip, Gore signaled
that he also will challenge Texas Gov. George W. Bush and his
running mate, Dick Cheney _ two former businessmen with oil company
ties _ on the issue of oil company profits and rising consumer fuel
prices.
</P>
<P>
   ``The profits of the big oil companies have skyrocketed just at
the time when the American people have been paying these gigantic
price increases,'' Gore told Fox News after the Sunnyvale rally.
``OPEC needs to keep its promise to raise production and to bring
the world prices down.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore outlined his prescription drug plan _ and pointedly
compared it to Bush's _ before an enthusiastic crowd of 1,500 at
Lakewood Park in Sunnyvale, as his campaign unleashed a round of
new television ads on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout his 70th trip to the nation's most populous state,
where 54 electoral votes hang in the balance, Gore's public remarks
emphasized differences with Bush on issues of health care,
prescription drugs, Social Security and taxes. But Bush's campaign,
at every stop, has fought back in tough criticisms, public
statements and press releases to counter his arguments point for
point.
</P>
<P>
   Just two weeks before the first presidential debate in Boston,
the intensifying tug-of-war between the campaigns looks more and
more like a rehearsal for what lies ahead.
</P>
<P>
   In Sunnyvale, Gore chose an audience stocked with members of
union locals to hit hard on the drug issue, a day after he
aggressively tackled the topic of medical privacy at a town hall
meeting in Southern California. Gore promised to ensure that all of
the nearly 40 million Americans on Medicare have access to
affordable prescription drugs, whether they are enrolled in
traditional Medicare or managed care.
</P>
<P>
   And he charged that drug companies spend ``hundreds of millions
of dollars on television and on magazine advertising to persuade
people to buy newer and more expensive medications when less
expensive versions would usually work just as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that's just wrong _ when they're putting more money
into advertising and promotion than they are into research and
development, and then charging seniors more than they can afford,''
Gore said. ``We need to make some changes.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore has said his 10-year, $253 billion plan to add prescription
drug coverage to Medicare would aid the 40 million Americans
enrolled in the plan. Bush has released a $158 billion plan that he
has said would boost market competition, lower prices on
prescription drugs and give seniors more choices.
</P>
<P>
   But Gore charged Wednesday that Bush's plan ``leaves out
millions of middle-class seniors, nearly half of all seniors.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore chose to address the issue even as the Republican Party
sent a ``Truth Truck'' to Sunnyvale in an attempt to confront him
about what it charged has been a pattern of exaggeration regarding
prescription drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney, also in California this week, charged Gore with
``playing fast and loose with the facts to win an argument'' when
the vice president told a crowd of Florida seniors in August that
his mother-in-law pays nearly three times as much for Lodine, an
arthritis medicine, than he pays for the same medicine for his dog,
Shiloh.
</P>
<P>
   When the Gore campaign later acknowledged that Gore referenced
wholesale prices in a House of Representatives study, Republicans
seized on the issue, clearly hoping to make a point about Gore's
credibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``Al Gore just can't talk straight,'' said California GOP
Chairman John McGraw in a statement. ``He claims he invented the
Internet (and) inspired `Love Story,' and his latest whopper takes
the cake,'' he said. ``Time and time again, Gore proves he'll say
or do anything to get elected.''
</P>
<P>
   One Sunnyvale GOP protester echoed the sentiment with a sign:
``Internet inventor, doggy drugs: what's next?''
</P>
<P>
   But Gore spokesman Chris Lehane told reporters Wednesday, ``The
bottom line, the point that the vice president is making ... is
that there is just something fundamentally wrong with the fact that
the drug companies charge three times as much for a drug for a
person than they do (for a drug) for a dog.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Bush campaign is obviously trying to pursue this issue
because they're desperate and they have no message on the
prescription drug issue,'' he said. ``This is what they've been
reduced to. They spent two years not talking about issues, and this
is what they're focusing on.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore, speaking to Fox News after the rally, then addressed oil
and gas prices, hinting that he will hit hard on a major consumer
issue starting Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The basic question is whether or not you'll have a president
who's willing to fight for the people, even when it means standing
up to the big oil companies and foreign oil, and I've never
hesitated to do that,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if oil companies are responsible for a spike in oil
prices, Gore said, ``I called for the investigation by the (Federal
Trade Commission), and that's still ongoing. We will await the
outcome of the investigation. Profits have gone up dramatically
just at the time that the American people are paying these
fantastic, big price increases, and I think that we need to respond
to that.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not just about gasoline,'' Gore said. ``It's about home
heating oil also, as we approach the start of the heating season.''

 DAVIS SIGNS FLURRY OF BILLS  &HT;     By GREG LUCAS and LYNDA GLEDHILL 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO _ Gov. Gray Davis signed legislation Wednesday
preventing condominium and mobile-home homeowners associations from
banning pets.
</P>
<P>
   The new law, which takes effect on Jan. 1, requires associations
to allow new members to keep at least one pet. It overrides a 1994
California Supreme Court ruling that allowed such bans.
</P>
<P>
   ``People who are lonely get a lot of sustenance and support from
animals,'' said the bill's author, Assemblywoman Helen Thomson,
D-Davis.
</P>
<P>
   The bill was one of dozens signed into law Wednesday by Gov.
Gray Davis, who must complete action by September 30 on nearly
1,000 bills sent to him by the Legislature when it wrapped up its
work for the year last month.
</P>
<P>
   Although bans already in effect would not be lifted under the
new law, homeowners associations would likely face pressure to
change their rules once enough new pet owners move in.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic governor signed the bill despite opposition by
the Western Mobilehome Parkowners Association and the California
Association of Community managers.
</P>
<P>
   The parkowners said the only way to deal with an unruly pet is
to terminate the owner's tenancy.
</P>
<P>
   The condominium community managers said pet bans are designed to
protect other residents from noise and allergic reactions to pets
as well as protect common areas of the development from damage.
</P>
<P>
   Thomson said the people who would benefit the most from pet
ownership are older Californians.
</P>
<P>
   Studies have shown that older persons who have pets live longer,
go to the doctor less often, recover more quickly from illnesses
and have a more positive outlook than those who don't.
</P>
<P>
   While Thomson's bill guarantees condo or mobile-home owners the
right to have at least one pet, it does allow homeowners
associations to establish `'reasonable'' rules and regulations for
pet ownership.
</P>
<P>
   State law already allows mobile-home park managers to boot a
resident who receives three written notices of violating one rule
or regulation within one year.
</P>
<P>
   Davis also vetoed several bills Wednesday, including one that
would require county clerks to give persons getting a marriage
license a fact sheet on marital rights and responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   Also vetoed was a bill aimed to restrict credit card sales on
college campuses and one to make it easier for transsexuals to get
a new birth certificate.
</P>
<P>
   In one of his more strongly worded stronger &LR; worded vetoes, Davis
rejected a bill that would have forced county clerks to hand
couples receiving a marriage license information about the
contractual obligations of marriage.
</P>
<P>
   Among the information on the fact sheet was to be rape and
domestic violence laws, child support obligations, prenuptial
agreements, responsibility for community debts and pension,
property and retirement rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe it is presumptuous and in very bad taste, to require
the county clerk, on the eve of someone's marriage, to offer a
couple a document detailing all of the problems and costs
associated with the dissolution of that marriage,'' the Democratic
governor wrote in his veto message.
</P>
<P>
   According to Assemblywoman Hannah-Beth Jackson, D-Santa Barbara,
who carried the bill, the idea was to make the 238,000 Californians
who tie the knot each year better informed about what they're
getting into.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many enter into marriage without discussing the
responsibilities and legal obligations that marriage entails with
their future spouse, Jackson wrote in a letter supporting the bill.
</P>
<P>
   Davis also vetoed a consumer protection bill that would have
required state universities and colleges to regulate the marketing
practices used by credit card companies.
</P>
<P>
   In his veto message, Davis said, ``Personal responsibility
cannot be mandated by government. The answer lies first and
foremost with parental guidance.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis also said that the majority of California private and
public colleges and universities already limit credit card
marketing practices on their campuses.
</P>
<P>
   Also vetoed was a bill that would have made it easier for
transsexuals to get new birth certificates.
</P>
<P>
   Davis said the bill was not needed because a court order for a
name change due to a sex change is already available to the public.
</P>
<P>
   Among the other bills Davis signed were measures to:
</P>
<P>
   --Raise the fine for people who park in a handicapped parking
space or fraudulently obtain a handicap placard to a minimum of
$250.
</P>
<P>
   That will not affect most Bay Area residents, who already pay
more than $250 for such a violation. In San Francisco, the fine is
$275, Oakland fines $325, San Jose charges $280 and Vallejo fines
$250. There are 6.6 million Californians with disabilities and
there are 1.4 million disabled parking permits.
</P>
<P>
   --Expand the 25-mph speed limit around schools to 500 feet
around the school grounds. Currently, the speed limit is in effect
only when passing a school building or school grounds.
</P>
<P>
   According to a 1997 National Highway Traffic Safety
Administration study, nearly one-third of all children between ages
5 and 9 that were killed in motor vehicle-related accidents were
pedestrians.

ON PRO BASKETBALL: KNICKS HAVE A HOLE IN THE MIDDLE
</HEADLINE>
  (With BKN-KNICKS-EWING)  
 By MIKE WISE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia _ Greetings from the Sydney Games, where the
New York Knicks' new starting center was outplayed by Canada's Todd
MacCulloch the other night.
</P>
<P>
   Patrick Ewing probably always imagined himself traded for
another Hall of Famer. Thursday, Luc Longley, the underachieving
center of the Australian national team, will have to do. He is a
very pleasant bloke, always quick with a joke and very
complimentary of the centers who routinely outplay him. But whether
playing him or Travis Knight, also part of Wednesday night's trade,
makes the New York Knicks more of a contender is barely a question
worth answering.
</P>
<P>
   This is hard to figure. Perhaps the decision-makers high above
Penn Plaza saw Longley in the opening ceremony and were overcome
with Olympic spirit. Maybe they were scared into moving Ewing,
dreading the prolonging of a relationship that was beginning to get
ugly.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe one of their owners is infatuated with wheeling and
dealing and names, figuring Glen Rice, the marquee name coming to
New York, could justify ticket increases and conceal the facade one
more season.
</P>
<P>
   Either way, the Knicks were soon to end their tumultuous 15-year
relationship with their franchise center, sending Ewing to Seattle
in the kind of monstrous deal that is becoming commonplace for the
NBA. It sounds like another fantasy league swap, concocted by a
couple of socially challenged freshmen over a pepperoni and
mushroom pizza in the campus bar.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks get six players, including Rice, Longley, Knight,
Vernon Maxwell and four draft picks, including the Lakers' and the
Sonics' top pick in 2001. Ewing goes to Seattle. Horace Grant and
three others go to the Lakers. Chris Dudley and a Knicks top pick
in 2001 go to Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   Shaquille O'Neal and Kobe Bryant finally get the kind of
front-line support to stave off Portland's redwoods for another
season. The Suns get a former All-Star, who is trying to find his
game and his balance. And the SuperSonics acquire a professional in
the pivot, who at 38 is still one of the top 10 centers in the
game, a warrior who, despite his injury-prone status the past three
seasons, is entering a contract year _ always a motivating factor
for aging players in this league.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks? Unless they have something else percolating, they
give up one of the few players who could grab an important
defensive rebound for them last season, earn a trip to the foul
line in the final minutes and occasionally blend in seamlessly with
Allan Houston and Latrell Sprewell.
</P>
<P>
   Unless they have something else percolating, they give up any
shot of contending for a championship. The hard truth: Without a
big player who can score to complement their All-Stars, the Knicks
are the Milwaukee Bucks.
</P>
<P>
   First round and out.
</P>
<P>
   You will hear testimony from people Thursday who believe the
Knicks can survive and thrive without Ewing, who believe a player
like Rice will turn them into the Sacramento Kings of the Eastern
Conference, a breathless, seat-of-the-pants team that will make
beautiful music in the open court. They will be entertaining to
watch for, oh, about 85 games.
</P>
<P>
   First round and out. Get used to the reality.
</P>
<P>
   It is true that Ewing had a hard time grasping the fact he was
no longer an All-Star. And at times, he monopolized the ball at the
end of games as if it were 1992 all over again and he could put up
40, easy, on Cartwright or whatever overmatched soul was guarding
him. But he also shot less and passed more after injuries robbed
his body of its explosiveness.
</P>
<P>
   Was Patrick the answer? Should he be thoroughly celebrated
Thursday instead of ushered out of town? Probably not. But for a
city allegedly home to some of the most knowledgeable basketball
people in the world, the good-riddance mob borders on the pathetic.
Many became infected with knee-jerk opinions about his game and his
contributions to the team the past two seasons, jumping on the same
Patrick-Must-Go bandwagon each time he had a tough night.
</P>
<P>
   The whole town so loved the things Spree and Marcus could do
above the rim, they became more infatuated with eye candy than
winning basketball. At times, when Ewing kicked the ball out,
rebounded and hit his baseline fall away when no one else was open,
the Garden had both.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps it's appropriate that the Knicks wind up with Longley,
who will be subjected to some of the most unfair treatment in his
career. He will hear every uncouth knock on his game, take in
stride the weekly back-page abuse and wonder why people are so
obsessed with winning in New York, instead of competing and having
a good time, as they do Down Under.
</P>
<P>
   As one of his meek jump shots caroms off the back of the rim to
lose a tight game, Longley will wonder what all of New York should
be wondering Thursday after they exchanged one future Hall of Famer
for a 7-foot role player:
</P>
<P>
   They used to boo Patrick Ewing? Poor bloke.  &QL;

 CLEAN HANDS, TRASHY FLOORS IN S.F.  &HT;     By SCOTT OSTLER 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Welcome to San Francisco. We wash our hands.
</P>
<P>
   Microbiologists _ or as amoebas call them, Peeping Toms _
conducted a study in public rest rooms. Do people wash their hands?
</P>
<P>
   Some people do!
</P>
<P>
   Of the five cities studied, S.F. was No. 2. Eighty percent here
wash their hands after TCB in a public WC.
</P>
<P>
   We should be proud of that 80 percent figure, since only about
75 percent of the folks in the city have access to running water.
The others wash their hands by leaving 'em out in the rain.
</P>
<P>
   There are some other interesting San Francisco stats that didn't
show up in the microbiologists' report. Or in any report, for that
matter.
</P>
<P>
   I researched these stats myself:
</P>
<P>
   --In public rest rooms, 94 percent of men don't flush. Of those,
53 percent think that little lever is a turn signal.
</P>
<P>
   --While nearly all men have played basketball, 82 percent can't
hit the trash basket with their crumpled-up paper towel.
</P>
<P>
   --On the street, 86 percent of S.F. drivers believe that the
yellow traffic light is some kind of holiday greeting.
</P>
<P>
   --Ninety-nine percent of pedestrians think the ``Don't Walk''
light is short for ``Don't Walk, but DO stroll, saunter, stagger,
strut, lollygag, lurch, mosey or meander.''
</P>
<P>
   --More than 75 percent of cell phone users believe that thing
attached to the side of their head is a  &UR; yell  &LR; phone.
</P>
<P>
   --Eighty-one percent of Muni riders believe that the most
efficient method of boarding the car is to jump in quickly when the
doors open,  &UR; then &LR;  let the other people fight their way out.
</P>
<P>
   --Ninety-eight percent of the time, I wash with soap and boiling
water after shaking hands with a microbiologist.
</P>
<P>
   USE A CAR, lose a car.
</P>
<P>
   That will be the policy of the city under a proposed law. If you
are arrested for doing a drug deal or soliciting a prostitute from
your car, the car will be carjacked by the city.
</P>
<P>
   No need to wait for a trial. Due process, schmoo process.
</P>
<P>
   You say you merely stopped to ask directions, the jury believes
you, and you are declared not guilty, and you want your car back?
Tell it to your Muni driver, pal.
</P>
<P>
   If we want to stop the drive-by drug-'n'-hug things, here are
two better ideas:
</P>
<P>
   --At every busy drug and/or hooker sales locale, station a
police officer on top of a nearby tall building. When a car stops
to do business, the officer hurls a warning steel bar down onto the
car.
</P>
<P>
   --Follow the Terence Hallinan model. If a car is involved in a
drug or sex deal, sentence the car to a diversion program.
</P>
<P>
   THE COOLEST dude in the Bay Area? It might be Johnny Otis.
</P>
<P>
   Johnny is an R&AMP;B legend, one of the leaders of the mid-century
music revolution that introduced the American masses to black
musicians and electric guitars.
</P>
<P>
   Otis is white, complexion-wise, but has always lived in the
world of black music. He wrote ``So Fine'' (the Fiestas), which
defined true love _ ``My baby's so doggone fine /loves me, come
rain come shine /whoa-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh/So fine.''
</P>
<P>
   Romantically speaking, anything beyond that is icing on the
icing.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Otis wrote and performed ``Willie and the Hand Jive,'' which
contains possibly the coolest guitar/ rhythm track in recorded
history.
</P>
<P>
   But enough of the old days. Otis and his blues/R&AMP;B caravan
headline this weekend's San Francisco Blues Festival at the Great
Meadow at Fort Mason (Otis plays Sunday).
</P>
<P>
   That's Johnny, 78, playing the vibes like nobody else. Local kid
_ born in Berkeley, lives in Sebastopol _ makes good.
</P>
<P>
   IT'S VICIOUS in the district supervisorial races.
</P>
<P>
   Dick Hongisto, running in Dist. 5, doesn't condone this type of
ruthless politics, he merely reports it:
</P>
<P>
   At the meet-the-candidates meetings, Juanita Owens always tells
the voters that she has earned two master's degrees. Tuesday night,
she told the audience, ``I have two masters.''
</P>
<P>
   Someone in the back called out, ``Yeah. Willie Brown and John
Burton.''
</P>
<P>
   AHOY! My observant colleague Carl Nolte observed a sporting
phenomenon unique to Pac Bell Park on Monday night: the sail-by
flashing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Boating babes were mooning and flashing their bosoms to the
multitudes peering over the right field wall into McCovey Cove.
</P>
<P>
   ``If these ladies had tried that at Candlestick, you know what
would have happened to their buns.''
</P>
<P>
   Jack Frost would've bitten 'em.
</P>
<P>
   SON OF FIRESTONE?
</P>
<P>
   Those lovely BMW motorcycles (some of the new ones, anyway) have
a problem: Soft rims, a potential for disaster.
</P>
<P>
   The CHP bought 650 of the bikes and BMW is replacing their rims
for free.
</P>
<P>
   You civilian owners, it will cost you $820.11 for the same fix.
Or: An arm and a leg.
</P>
<P>
   That's the word from my motorized-bicycle expert, John Joss.
</P>
<P>
   The moral: If you want your Beemer bike fixed, join the CHP.
</P>
<P>
   OLYMPIC MOMENT: We put shark suits on swimmers, flak jackets on
gridders,; every athlete now has ultra-high-tech gear for
protection and performance.
</P>
<P>
   And yet we can do nothing about: Gymnast wedgies.

 HIGH-TECH VISAS UNDER SCRUTINY  &HT;     By DAVID LAZARUS 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Federal authorities have started nationwide investigations into
the hiring of foreign high-tech workers, including charges of visa
fraud and allegations that the practice is riddled with abuse, The
Chronicle has learned.
</P>
<P>
   The investigations by the Immigration and Naturalization Service
and the Department of Labor are being conducted as Silicon Valley,
facing a severe shortage of workers, pushes Congress to expand the
controversial H-1B visa system.
</P>
<P>
   The immigration service is looking into assertions that H-1B
applicants are falsifying academic and work credentials, and that
U.S. employers _ in many cases acting as nothing more than agencies
for temporary employees _ are exploiting workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We deny tens of thousands of (visa) cases every year,'' said
Bill Yates, a senior immigration service official in Washington,
D.C. ``But are we catching most of the fraud? The truthful answer
is that we're not.''
</P>
<P>
   He said immigration agents began re-examining H-1B cases
throughout the country in July as part of a sweeping attempt to
gauge the scope of ``misrepresentations'' by visa applicants and
employers, which include some of the biggest names in the U.S. tech
industry.
</P>
<P>
   Labor Department officials, meanwhile, said a separate
investigation of possible H-1B violations is now under way in the
Bay Area. They refused to elaborate.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I can say is that we have cases open in Silicon Valley,''
said a department spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   H-1B visas have emerged as a hot political issue, with both Vice
President Al Gore and Texas Gov. George W. Bush embracing Silicon
Valley's calls for raising the number of foreign tech workers
allowed into the country each year.
</P>
<P>
   Congress is considering whether to increase the current annual
limit of 115,000 H-1B visas to 200,000. Demand for the visas is so
fierce, this year's allotment ran out in March.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a major problem,'' said Thom Stohler, director of
workforce policy for the American Electronics Association, an
industry group representing more than 3,000 high-tech heavyweights.
``When you talk to the HR people in Silicon Valley, they say it's
very hard finding skilled people.''
</P>
<P>
   But critics of H-1B visas, including many U.S. programmers and
engineers, say tech companies are overstating the scope of worker
shortages to maintain a steady supply of foreign-born employees
willing to work longer hours for lower wages.
</P>
<P>
   ``H-1B is indentured servitude,'' said Rob Sanchez, a programmer
from Phoenix who maintains that he lost his job last year to an
H-1B visa holder. ``That's the whole idea behind this program.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, Sanchez and other critics concede that many if not
most H-1B visa holders are meeting a legitimate demand for skilled
workers and play a key role in the continued expansion of the U.S.
tech industry.
</P>
<P>
   But, as the current fraud investigations illustrate, the system
is not foolproof. By any reckoning, the H-1B program in place today
has substantially changed from its legislative roots.
</P>
<P>
   When the program first began in the early 1950s, its intent was
to allow qualified foreign workers to hold temporary positions with
American companies.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the H-1B visa is seen by applicants as a stepping stone
to obtaining permanent U.S. residency _ the coveted ``green card.''
And a tier of entrepreneurs has emerged to both expedite and profit
by from the immigration process.
</P>
<P>
   Known as ``body shops,'' some of these middlemen are at the
heart of many of the charges of visa fraud and abuse.
</P>
<P>
   They recruit workers overseas and arrange for their visas. They
then farm out the workers to U.S. companies, often cutting
themselves in for as much as half of the employee's salary.
</P>
<P>
   Body shops are especially prevalent among Indian workers, who
make up by far the largest segment of H-1B visa holders. According
to a report released this month by the U.S. General Accounting
Office, Indians accounted for about half of all H-1B visas handed
out in the last fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
   As for how legitimate body shops operate, it would be hard to
find a better or more efficient example than that of Manka
Ahluwalia, who runs her small ``consultancy,'' TIC Resources, out
of her husband's law office on the fringe of San Francisco's
Financial District.
</P>
<P>
   Manka's spouse, Raja, is himself an immigration lawyer, allowing
TIC to make a persuasive case for the breadth of its services when
recruiting workers back in India.
</P>
<P>
   ``Others have to find an attorney and do all the work,'' Manka
said. ``I just give the whole thing to my husband.''
</P>
<P>
   The chain begins in Delhi, where Manka's brother-in-law, Preet,
serves as TIC's recruiter. He advertises in local newspapers and on
the Internet for workers with specific tech skills _ proficiency in
the Java programming language, for example.
</P>
<P>
   Manka said Preet will sift through submitted resumes and check
academic and vocational references. Then, when a suitable candidate
is found, TIC will begin the application process for an H-1B visa.
</P>
<P>
   The applicant, now technically a TIC employee, signs a contract
before leaving home agreeing to a fixed salary, usually about
$60,000 a year, or roughly $30 an hour for a 40-hour workweek.
</P>
<P>
   Manka said she shells out about $3,000 per employee for airfare
to the Bay Area, moving costs and a week or two of initial rental
payments. The idea is to quickly place the worker as an independent
contractor with a local tech firm.
</P>
<P>
   ``We usually start marketing him a week before he comes here,''
Manka said.
</P>
<P>
   Once a job is found, she said she often charges the hiring
company about $60 an hour for the services of TIC's ``consultant.''
Half this amount goes to the worker, per the conditions of the
previously signed contract, and the rest is profit for TIC.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have to work any more,'' Manka observed. ``Now I do
this full time.''
</P>
<P>
   Her husband, Raja, was quick to note that nothing TIC does is
illegal. ``I believe in the entrepreneurial system,'' he said. ``I
believe in the American dream.''
</P>
<P>
   While admitting that some might see the body-shop system as a
form of exploitation, Raja stressed that no one forces workers to
employ the services of go-betweens and that body shops play a
valuable role in expediting the visa process.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they have a preference, people would rather work directly
for a company than a body shopper,'' he said. ``But they stick with
the body shopper because a body shopper can process a green card.''
</P>
<P>
   There's the rub. The procedure for obtaining a green card
requires that the applicant remain on the payroll of a single
employer. If the applicant switches jobs, he or she falls to the
bottom of the queue.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of TIC, the incentive not to leave the body shop is
even greater. With Manka's husband handling the green-card
application process, departing workers face the distinct
possibility of losing favor with their own attorney.
</P>
<P>
   Raja freely admitted that other body shops may not be as
scrupulous as his wife's in upholding the law. ``Of course, there
is fraud,'' he said. ``Everybody knows it.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the most common forms of H-1B fraud involves
falsification of academic and work credentials. A bachelor's degree
(or its vocational equivalent) is required for H-1B status, as well
as proof of specific work skills.
</P>
<P>
   Some Indians have reported that overseas recruiters will charge
workers as much as $6,000 to improve their visa chances. In return,
relatively unskilled workers will receive a month or two of
computer training along with paperwork attesting to far more
extensive work experience.
</P>
<P>
   Diplomas from existing or even nonexistent universities also can
be arranged.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a well-known fact that people in India will take two or
three classes in Java programming, then the body shop will create a
resume for them,'' said Inder Singh, a former H-1B visa holder now
working as a programmer on the East Coast.
</P>
<P>
   ``You will find that a lot of them don't have the work
experience they claim to have,'' he said. ``The body shop does it
for them. They are very good at glossing over resumes.''
</P>
<P>
   Catching all such instances of fraud is virtually impossible for
U.S. consulates abroad. Meanwhile, immigration officials are
themselves overwhelmed by the number of visa applications submitted
and seldom have opportunities to check on specific petitions.
</P>
<P>
   In a scathing report on shortcomings in the H-1B visa system,
the General Accounting Office pointed out that immigration agents
are judged by the number of visa applications they process, not the
number of lies spotted in accompanying documents.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a result,'' it said, ``there is not sufficient assurance
that INS reviews are adequate for detecting program noncompliance
or abuse.''
</P>
<P>
   The immigration service's Yates said his agency disagreed with
much of the GAO's findings. He said the immigration service is
doing a perfectly adequate job with the resources available.
</P>
<P>
   ``We simply don't have the resources to check on every visa
petition,'' Yates said.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, he testified before a congressional subcommittee that
the U.S. Consulate in Chennai (formerly Madras) issued 20,000 visas
in the previous fiscal year, more than any other diplomatic post in
India.
</P>
<P>
   Yates told legislators that a subsequent immigration service
investigation revealed that 21 percent of vocational resumes
submitted by visa applicants were fictitious and 29 percent more
``were either probably or possibly fraudulent.''
</P>
<P>
   Christopher Lamora, a spokesman for the State Department's
bureau of consular affairs, told The Chronicle that diplomatic
officials are doing their best to keep visa fraud at bay.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know that visa fraud exists,'' he said. ``If we find out
about it, we do our best to crack down.'' Lamora declined to
discuss current investigations.
</P>
<P>
   Yates of the immigration service said that in the year since he
appeared before Congress, advances in computer technology have
significantly improved his agency's ability to spot bogus
credentials. Nevertheless, he said, about 20 percent of resumes
submitted still contain fraudulent information.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no denying that applications can slip through,'' Yates
said. ``If it is the intention of the employee or the employer to
defraud the government, you may not be able to ferret it out.''
</P>
<P>
   Once a worker is in the country, it is largely the
responsibility of the Department of Labor to ensure that conditions
of the H-1B visa are not being abused.
</P>
<P>
   But there's a big catch: Labor officials can investigate
potential fraud or abuse only after a complaint has been lodged by
an H-1B worker. Few workers dare jeopardize their employment status
or green-card prospects by filing such complaints.
</P>
<P>
   ``The notion that this program can be enforced on a
complaint-only basis is naive, if not misguided,'' said John
Fraser, deputy administrator of the Labor Department's wage and
hour division.
</P>
<P>
   The numbers suggest as much. Out of more than 600,000 H-1B tech
workers who have arrived in the United States since 1990, fewer
than 400 have ever complained to the Labor Department of
mistreatment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Others have taken that data and argued that compliance is not
an issue,'' Fraser said. ``We know it's an issue.''
</P>
<P>
   An aspect of H-1B visas that especially rankles Labor officials
is the practice of ``benching.'' This is when a body shop cannot
find immediate work for a ``consultant'' and leaves the worker
essentially to fend for himself, with reduced or no pay in
violation of his contract.
</P>
<P>
   Workers who complain about being benched are frequently
threatened with being shipped back to India.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is illegal,'' Fraser said. ``Unfortunately, it's quite
common.''
</P>
<P>
   Raja Ahluwalia, the immigration lawyer, said that while benching
is against the law, it has become a routine part of the body-shop
trade.
</P>
<P>
   ``In business, you do what is best for your business,'' he
explained. ``Where there is a possibility for profit, an
entrepreneur, by definition, should exploit it.''
</P>
<P>
   Another development that has authorities scratching their heads
is the way major Indian consulting firms _ among the leading
petitioners for H-1B visas _ are manipulating the system for their
own benefit.
</P>
<P>
   In such cases, the consultancy learns from clients about a
coming tech project and agrees to provide H-1B workers to help meet
the project's deadlines. In so doing, the consultancy may parcel
out some or all of the work to other employees back in India.
</P>
<P>
   This is how Tata Consultancy Services operates. A subsidiary of
India's largest conglomerate, Tata boasts of a client list that
includes such Bay Area powerhouses as Oracle Corp., Intel Corp. and
Cisco Systems.
</P>
<P>
   Subramanian Sambamurthy, regional manager at Tata's San
Francisco office, said his company's service allows clients to
maintain production schedules on a virtually round-the-clock basis,
with work performed simultaneously in the United States and in
India.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shortening the time to market is what we are doing,'' he said.
``We are not seeking to create employment opportunities for Indians
in the U.S. We are seeking to help our customers.''
</P>
<P>
   However, each consultant the company brings over from India to
learn the particulars of a client's project requires the issuance
of an H-1B visa, even though the visa will not be used, as
originally intended, to fill a local need among U.S. firms.
</P>
<P>
   Rather, this is an example of H-1Bs being used at least in part
to drum up business for foreign companies and their workers
overseas.
</P>
<P>
   Tata received 320 H-1B visas between October 1999 and February
of this year, according to immigration service records. Other major
Indian ``outsourcing'' consultancies include Mastech Corp. (389
visas), Syntel Inc. (337) and Wipro Corp. (327).
</P>
<P>
   Yates of the immigration service said he had not heard about
such use of the visas but said he found it troubling. ``If it takes
work away from American workers, that's a problem,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Lenni Benson, an associate professor at New York Law School
specializing in immigration law, said that despite such blatant
manipulation of H-1B statutes, she would not encourage Congress to
tamper significantly with the law.
</P>
<P>
   The system, she said, is clearly benefiting U.S. industry by
supplying access to thousands of skilled workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're a startup in Silicon Valley,'' Benson observed,
``you can go directly to a body shop and have them take care of
everything.''
</P>
<P>
   To better protect workers, though, she said the law at least
should be amended to allow H-1B holders to switch employers without
jeopardizing their employment status or green-card prospects.
</P>
<P>
   ``Give them free agency,'' Benson said. ``Give them the same
powers as any other worker in the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, legislators are pondering measures along these lines,
although it remains unclear what, if anything, they will do in
conjunction with a proposed increase in the annual visa quota.
</P>
<P>
   Manka Ahluwalia, for one, would not be displeased to see a
greater number of H-1B visas available. Her body shop is always on
the lookout for new talent.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are so many projects going on,'' she noted. ``There will
always be room for more consultants.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Business is thriving for everyone,'' her husband said.

 WILDFIRE CLAIMS LIFE OF WOMAN WHO REFUSED TO EVACUATE  &HT;     By CHARLIE GOODYEAR 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   A swift-moving wildfire killed a stubborn woman in Butte County,
Calif., Wednesday after she refused to leave her home and rebuffed
a rescue attempt by a firefighter injured trying to save her.
</P>
<P>
   Hot spots prevented police from recovering the unidentified
victim's body at her home in the rural community of Concow. The
fire, meanwhile, advanced down a canyon east of the town of
Paradise, where residents of 1,000 homes were asked to get ready to
leave.
</P>
<P>
   California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection officials
identified the fire captain who tried to rescue the woman as Darryl
Sanford of CDFs Butte County unit. Sanford suffered burns on his
hands and face and was treated at a hospital before being released.
</P>
<P>
   ``He tried to save her,'' said Forestry Department spokeswoman
Karen Terrill. ``He tried to assist her in evacuating, and she
declined. He was burned, and obviously this was a really traumatic
experience for him.''
</P>
<P>
   Butte County Sheriff Scott MacKenzie said the fire is still
smoldering where the woman was killed. ``We're waiting for the
rubble in the house to cool down before we go in and retrieve the
remains. It's in a very secluded and rural area,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   More than 700 firefighters were battling the 1,500-acre fire,
which was burning on the east side of a branch of the Feather
River.
</P>
<P>
   According to one report, the fire had crossed the river late
Wednesday and was burning a small area on the west bank, but
investigators still had not confirmed this by early evening.
</P>
<P>
   The fire was 50 percent contained on Tuesday night before winds
blew it out of control, tripling its size.
</P>
<P>
   Sheriff's officials have asked people near the fire to leave
voluntarily and, with the exception of the woman killed Wednesday,
residents have been cooperating.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just do not do mandatory evacuations,'' MacKenzie said.
``It really has to do with the right of people to protect their
property. But we take very strong advisory measures, and rarely do
we find an individual who does not want to leave their home after
we have given the advisory. This fatality is very much the
exception to what we have experienced.''
</P>
<P>
   The Forestry Department reported that the fire destroyed two
structures and damaged a third. A fire engine also was overrun by
flames.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said the fire was 40 percent contained by early
Wednesday evening.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's starting to look better, and as long as the winds don't
come up we should make progress,'' said Forestry Department
spokeswoman Karen Sager.
</P>
<P>
   Concow resident Robert Lunt said the sound of fire engines woke
him about 1:30 a.m. Wednesday. The flames encircled Lunt's
119-year-old farmhouse, but the building wasn't damaged.
</P>
<P>
   ``We lost a corral, a sawmill, a chicken house, but the barn was
saved,'' he said. ``Once it started, it created a lot of wind and
started throwing its own sparks.''
</P>
<P>
   Lunt, who was home with his 16-year-old son, said he heard that
a herd of his cattle was seen in good health, but not near the
ranch.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities said the blaze was sparked on Monday by a
privately-owned tractor.
</P>
<P>
   Crews fought the flames with more than 40 engines, 17 water
tenders, eight air tankers and five helicopters. Temperatures at
the scene soared into the high 90s.
</P>
<P>
   The fire shut down parts of Highway 70 and prompted officials to
issue voluntary evacuation advisories on the eastern side of
Paradise, which has a population of 28,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're just asking them to be on standby or pack up their
valuables, `` said Frankie Rutledge, a Paradise police spokeswoman.
``The fire's on the other side of a river, and the winds have died
down a little bit. But if it crosses that river, we'd be in
trouble. We'd have about an hour to get out.''
</P>
<P>
   The Paradise Unified School District ordered all schools to
remain closed Wednesday as smoke drifted over the southern part of
town. A senior center was being set up to serve as a shelter if
needed.
</P>
<P>
   ``All city offices are open, and there is no imminent danger to
structures in town,'' Rutledge said.
</P>

STRONG ECONOMY LIKELY TO PUSH HOME PRICES UP
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GREGORY J. WILCOX 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ A continued strong economy is expected to drive
the median price of a California home to a record level next year
even as sales soften, a real estate trade group said in its 2001
market forecast released Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   During 2001 the state's median price, the point at which half
the homes sell for more and half for less, is expected to hit
$269,200 next year, an 8.5 percent gain from this year, said the
forecast from the California Association of Realtors.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, sales of previously owned homes are expected to
decline 2.7 percent, the trade group said.
</P>
<P>
   However, that drop follows what so far has been a strong year
for the real estate market.
</P>
<P>
   ``The California housing market is having one of its best years
on record and it looks like 2001 will continue the trend,''
association President Richard F. Gaylord said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Californians are optimistic about the future of the state, and
their confidence is reflected in the ongoing health of the . . .
market.''
</P>
<P>
   This year there should be 521,750 sales of previously owned
homes in California, a 3 percent decline from 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Next year the sale count could slide to 507,750 units, the
forecast said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Home resales in California will continue to moderate to a more
sustainable level in 2001,'' said Leslie Appleton-Young, the
organization's vice president and chief economist. ``The strong
underlying dynamics of the California economy continue to propel
the housing market in the state.''
</P>
<P>
   The association's forecast for 2001 calls for:
</P>
<P>
   -- A 3.6 percent expansion in the U.S. gross domestic product
vs. a 5.2 percent gain this year.
</P>
<P>
   -- Fixed mortgage interest rates to average 8.5 percent, up
slightly from the 8.2 percent average projected for all of 2000;
adjustable mortgage rates are expected to rise to 7.8 percent from
7.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   -- Residential housing permits to reach 148,910 next year, down
3.0 percent from the 2000 level.
</P>
<P>
   -- Nonfarm employment to increase by 2.6 percent and the state's
population to grow by 1.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Ted Gibson, chief economist for the California Department of
Finance, believes the real estate association's numbers are
achievable, although new housing starts could be slightly higher
than forecast.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't see any slowdown in the state's economy. We think
next year will be pretty close to this one,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the huge price appreciation is being driven by markets
in the San Francisco area and to some degree in Orange County
because of tight inventories.
</P>
<P>
   That's also one reason why median prices in the San Fernando
Valley hit a record $255,000 during August.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the Bay Area you already have a situation where housing is
constraining growth and companies are starting to pay attention to
that. And some of it is starting to benefit Sacramento because some
of the dot-coms are moving out here,'' Gibson said.

 CNBC AND CNNfn SEE THE LIGHT WITH BUREAUS IN SILICON VALLEY   c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Cable television's two leading financial news
networks have apparently made a startling discovery: This
technology stuff is a big deal, and it's not going away.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe such mockery is a bit harsh, but I can't help but snicker
at the seeming tardiness of CNBC and CNNfn's recent announcements
that they are establishing Silicon Valley bureaus.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of CNNfn _ the business division of cable giant CNN
_ the West Coast presence is due largely to Moneyline anchor Willow
Bay's decision to move to Los Angeles. And that's primarily because
Bay's husband, Walt Disney Co. President Robert Iger, needed to
move to L.A.
</P>
<P>
   ``My desire to live here now that my husband is based here, and
CNN's need to have a presence here dovetailed perfectly,'' Bay said
in a telephone interview. ``I certainly think it is overdue. We
haven't shortchanged coverage of (Silicon Valley), but it has been
from afar.''
</P>
<P>
   The two fiercely competitive networks disagree over who had the
first idea to set up shop in the valley. CNBC set up its bureau
first, opening in Palo Alto in July, while CNN says it announced
its intention first, back in January.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe so, says CNBC Managing Editor Mark Hoffman, but he was
unaware of CNN's plans. He says he started interviewing prospective
bureau chiefs late last year. CNBC's valley coverage had primarily
consisted of putting Wall Street Journal reporters on the air to
talk about hot tech stories, and it will continue that practice
under its deal with the Journal.
</P>
<P>
   The new bureau is in the Journal's Palo Alto, Calif., printing
plant on Page Mill Road and is staffed with four people, including
bureau chief Steve Dowling. ``There's room for growth,'' but no
immediate plans, Dowling said.
</P>
<P>
   Dowling is a five-year veteran of CNBC's Washington, D.C.,
bureau, dating back to the 1996 presidential campaign. He covered
the Microsoft antitrust trial for a year and a half, launching him
onto the tech beat. Since landing in Silicon Valley in July, his
team has landed interviews with CEOs such as Carly Fiorina of
Hewlett-Packard, Larry Ellison of Oracle, Steve Jobs of Apple
Computer and Meg Whitman of EBay, among others.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, he said CNBC had the first interview with former
Oracle exec Ray Lane after he announced he was joining venture fund
Kleiner, Perkins, Caufield &AMP; Byers. (Gratuitous plug: The
Chronicle's Kelly Zito scored the first interview with Lane after
he left Oracle.) In addition, Dowling claimed a CNBC scoop on an
Apple trade secrets lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just by having a team on the ground, we're already miles ahead
_ a thousand miles ahead,'' Dowling said.
</P>
<P>
   CNBC has been beating the pants off CNN in recent years, putting
something of a damper on Ted Turner's 20th anniversary celebration
of founding the pioneering cable network. CNN's business division
suffered a particularly severe blow when Moneyline anchor Lou Dobbs
left to spearhead the Internet company Space.com. More recently,
CNN has suffered through a management shakeup that saw CNN-U.S.
President Rick Kaplan resign.
</P>
<P>
   But CNN is upbeat about what it calls the bicoastal Moneyline,
with Bay anchoring the program from Los Angeles while co-anchor
Stuart Varney remains in New York. CNN still plans to open a bureau
in the Bay Area, but hasn't said when that will happen. The network
just hired a producer, J.J. Ramburg _ a Stanford grad with
television and dot-com experience, having worked at ``Dateline''
and at Cooking.com.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hope she will be based in Silicon Valley. It depends on the
price of real estate,'' said Kathy O'Hearn, executive vice
president of CNNfn and CNN Business News.
</P>
<P>
   O'Hearn noted that while the bureau is a new venture for CNN's
business news division, ``it's exactly in the tradition of CNN,''
which is an international powerhouse famous for having
correspondents all over the planet.
</P>
<P>
   One thing CNN and CNBC agree on: ``Business news is the most
competitive area of journalism today. It's an exciting time and a
booming economy,'' O'Hearn said.
</P>
<P>
   And it's getting even more interesting, now that tech stocks are
not just soaring, but are sinking as well. ``I find it more
interesting than the run-up,'' said CNBC's Dowling. ``You have
other forces at work. Seeing how the shakeup works will be
interesting for us and for our viewers.''
</P>
<P>
   And I'll be interested to see if there's a shakeout among
purveyors of cable financial news.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
HEARD THE NEW APPLE RUMOR? Tech companies make no secret of their
desire to control the press, but this report seemed to go a little
far: Apple Computer was said to be telling publications to sign a
pledge not to print rumors or risk losing lucrative Apple ads.
</P>
<P>
   ZDNet senior news producer Matthew Rothenberg broke the story
last week, citing anonymous sources as saying that Apple's ad
agency, TBWA/Chiat/Day of Los Angeles, wanted a signed statement
from editors and publishers that their publication does not print
rumors.
</P>
<P>
   It looked like control-crazy Apple was trying to tighten up its
famously leaky ranks.
</P>
<P>
   Chiat/Day, however, says it was acting without Apple's knowledge
and was merely conducting research about the editorial policies at
two publications, MacWorld and MacAddict. ``We weren't trying to
strong-arm anything,'' said Jeremy Miller, public relations
director at TBWA/Chiat/Day. ``We're not telling them they can't do
their job as journalists.''
</P>
<P>
   Rothenberg posted an updated story yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Capps, editor in chief of MacAddict, said, ``We've never
been asked to sign anything, and Apple has never asked us not to
print rumors. . . . The last thing I'd want is for people to open
up my magazine and see an Apple ad and think we signed something.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides, Capps said, his magazine seldom prints rumors about
Apple, because it's a monthly and isn't as scoop-crazy as an
Internet publication like, say, ZDNet.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, he said, Apple holds a far greater club than the
threat to pull ads: The magazine's editorial content is often
dependent on Apple's willingness to provide information and early
versions of products for review.
</P>
<P>
   MacWorld representatives did not return phone calls.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
BAGGING EMPLOYEES: In a bid to lure prospective workers, Red
Herring Communications has taken to putting ads on paper bags. My
colleague Kevin Albert brought in a bag from a neighborhood
doughnut shop on Fifth Street in San Francisco, with the Red
Herring logo plastered all over it.
</P>
<P>
   The bag features a fortune cookie with this promise: ``An
exciting and rewarding job awaits you at Red Herring.'' It lists 18
job categories where it's hiring and promises benefits including
``pre-IPO stock options.''
</P>
<P>
   It's part of a guerrilla marketing effort that has not only paid
off with new hires, according to the Herring's acting vice
president of marketing, Kim Kapoor, but also helps build brand
awareness.
</P>
<P>
   Given the merger anxiety in our neighborhood _ not to mention
newspaper employees' proclivity toward doughnuts _ that's one
well-placed want ad.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
PERFECTION? When William Dean Singleton's ANG Newspapers said this
week that it was taking control of my alma mater, the Marin
Independent Journal, the sale was the IJ's lead story. The headline
trumpeted: ``IJ media deal called perfect fit.''
</P>
<P>
   The story _ which lacked comment from any IJ editors or
executives _ gave the distinct impression that the deal will likely
make a lot of money for Singleton and the IJ's former owner, the
Gannett Co.
</P>
<P>
   But will it be perfect for readers or for journalists? Well, the
story did point out Singleton's reputation for ``turning out a
low-quality product,'' and cited fears that the paper would get
worse.
</P>
<P>
   Not that that would make for much of a Page One headline.

STRONG ECONOMY LIKELY TO PUSH HOME PRICES UP
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GREGORY J. WILCOX 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ A continued strong economy is expected to drive
the median price of a California home to a record level next year
even as sales soften, a real estate trade group said in its 2001
market forecast released Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   During 2001 the state's median price, the point at which half
the homes sell for more and half for less, is expected to hit
$269,200 next year, an 8.5 percent gain from this year, said the
forecast from the California Association of Realtors.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, sales of previously owned homes are expected to
decline 2.7 percent, the trade group said.
</P>
<P>
   However, that drop follows what so far has been a strong year
for the real estate market.
</P>
<P>
   ``The California housing market is having one of its best years
on record and it looks like 2001 will continue the trend,''
association President Richard F. Gaylord said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Californians are optimistic about the future of the state, and
their confidence is reflected in the ongoing health of the . . .
market.''
</P>
<P>
   This year there should be 521,750 sales of previously owned
homes in California, a 3 percent decline from 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Next year the sale count could slide to 507,750 units, the
forecast said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Home resales in California will continue to moderate to a more
sustainable level in 2001,'' said Leslie Appleton-Young, the
organization's vice president and chief economist. ``The strong
underlying dynamics of the California economy continue to propel
the housing market in the state.''
</P>
<P>
   The association's forecast for 2001 calls for:
</P>
<P>
   -- A 3.6 percent expansion in the U.S. gross domestic product
vs. a 5.2 percent gain this year.
</P>
<P>
   -- Fixed mortgage interest rates to average 8.5 percent, up
slightly from the 8.2 percent average projected for all of 2000;
adjustable mortgage rates are expected to rise to 7.8 percent from
7.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   -- Residential housing permits to reach 148,910 next year, down
3.0 percent from the 2000 level.
</P>
<P>
   -- Nonfarm employment to increase by 2.6 percent and the state's
population to grow by 1.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Ted Gibson, chief economist for the California Department of
Finance, believes the real estate association's numbers are
achievable, although new housing starts could be slightly higher
than forecast.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't see any slowdown in the state's economy. We think
next year will be pretty close to this one,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the huge price appreciation is being driven by markets
in the San Francisco area and to some degree in Orange County
because of tight inventories.
</P>
<P>
   That's also one reason why median prices in the San Fernando
Valley hit a record $255,000 during August.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the Bay Area you already have a situation where housing is
constraining growth and companies are starting to pay attention to
that. And some of it is starting to benefit Sacramento because some
of the dot-coms are moving out here,'' Gibson said.

NO DECISIONS UNTIL AFTER SEASON
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Looking to tame the circus atmosphere that's
engulfed the Los Angeles Dodgers for the last few months, Dodgers
brass held an impromptu press conference Wednesday to state no
announcements regarding the future of manager Davey Johnson or
general manager Kevin Malone would be made until after the season.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Daly, the managing general partner, CEO and chairman of the
Dodgers, also said he wouldn't speak about the standing of either
Malone or Johnson. But the briefing didn't dispel that neither
Johnson's nor Malone's jobs were in jeopardy.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the season is over, (president and COO) Bob (Graziano)
and I and other people will sit down and make an evaluation on the
player personnel, and that goes for everybody in our organization
that we want to sit down and talk about,'' Daly said. ``It won't be
the Monday after (the season). It may be a week, it may be two
weeks, it may be three weeks. I can't tell you the exact amount of
time. But we're going to make a full evaluation, meet every day and
talk. That's where we are.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the swirl around the Dodgers centered around Johnson's
future and his likely imminent firing. But the Dodgers' process
became more convoluted when it was reported Monday in the Daily
News that Malone's job was in jeopardy.
</P>
<P>
   Daly, flanked by club president Bob Graziano, said he would wait
until the end of the season to gather and process the information
before decisions are made.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a distraction for me and it is for Bob,'' Daly said.
``We're going to have to make our evaluation, make our decision, at
the end of the year. That's going to be our decision and we're
going to have to live with our decision because that's what we get
paid to do.''
</P>
<P>
   The press conference is just the latest attempt to quell the
mayhem of an organization seemingly careening out of control, but
it's been going this way since the first week of July when Daly
drove to San Diego to speak with Johnson. During that pregame
meeting, Daly told Johnson the club needed to play with more energy
and intensity.
</P>
<P>
   That was compounded when Malone lashed out at Johnson's managing
style at the All-Star break.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anything that I caused, I caused because I wanted to light a
fire under everybody,'' Daly said. ``The fire was under everybody,
including myself, Bob, the manager, the general manager, the
coaches and the players. If that fire backfired, I apologize to
everybody for it, but the truth of the matter was, it was done to
motivate people to move a little faster and get everything going.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I contributed to it, I take full responsibility. I don't
know whether it backfired or not. It wasn't intended to backfire.
It was intended to be a pep rally. It was intended to be a
positive.''
</P>
<P>
   Daly said he didn't know whether it caused a problem, though
it's widely thought of throughout the organization as the defining
moment of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let me just say this: It wouldn't have caused me to have a
problem because people have said this my whole life,'' Daly said.
``Everywhere I've worked, people have said, `C'mon, you need to do
a little bit more, you've got to do a little bit more.' That's how
you get successful. People have always pushed me to go further. If
it backfired, maybe I didn't know the personalities, maybe I didn't
know the dynamics. Chalk it up to inexperience.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Odds and ends: While Rome burns, there are things taking
place on the field, and one of them involved Mark Grudzielanek.
With lefty Randy Johnson pitching and a shortage at shortstop
because of the ailing Kevin Elster, Grudzielanek was shifted from
second base back to his natural position of shortstop so
lefty-hitting Alex Cora didn't have to face Johnson. That allowed
rookie Hiram Bocachica, making his first career start, to play
second base. . . . With days off today and Monday, Dodgers manager
Davey Johnson has settled on his starting rotation. Rookie Eric
Gagne will pitch Friday against San Diego, and Luke Prokopec will
throw in relief if needed. Kevin Brown goes Saturday and Chan Ho
Park pitches Sunday.

WORKING ASSETS RINGS UP SUCCESS 
</HEADLINE>
   By TODD WALLACK  
 c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ &LR;   &LR; Most telephone company executives are probably
used to getting harangued by angry customers.
</P>
<P>
   Not Laura Scher.
</P>
<P>
   While at a San Francisco restaurant recently, the Working Assets
chief executive was interrupted by a beaming diner at an adjacent
table who was eager to introduce himself as a happy, longtime
customer.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's actually not uncommon,'' Scher said between bites of
her fruit salad. ``Our customers have been extremely happy.''
</P>
<P>
   To hear Scher tell it, Working Assets Funding Service is a
different kind of long-distance company _ one committed to making a
difference. Working Assets promises to earmark 1 percent of its
charges for charity _ but actually gives more. In an unusual twist,
the 15-year-old San Francisco firm even lets its 330,000 customers
vote on a ``progressive'' slate of nonprofits, ranging from organic
food researchers to human rights groups.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, while rivals AT&AMP;T and WorldCom annually spend millions
on television commercials and telemarketers to attract customers,
Working Assets has benefited from a wave of free publicity and word
of mouth. Scher has been featured everywhere from People magazine
to NBC's ``Today'' show. The San Francisco League of Women Voters
dubbed her one of four women who could become president of the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   And nowhere is Working Assets more popular than California,
where nearly one-third of its customers live.
</P>
<P>
   But critics say Working Assets is just another for-profit
corporation with a clever &LR;   &LR; marketing gimmick.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Carbone, a San Francisco consumer attorney, faults
Working Assets for charging customers as much as AT&AMP;T, WorldCom and
Sprint. Carbone contends that customers could double or triple
their contributions by picking a cheaper long-distance firm, like
GTC Telecom, and donating their savings.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are in the business of making money,'' said Carbone, who
has been retained by the Utility Consumers' Action Network, a San
Diego consumers group. ``As much as Working Assets professes to
care about its customers, it doesn't because it overcharges them.''
</P>
<P>
   Carbone also chides Working Assets for enticing customers with
free pints of Ben &AMP; Jerry's ice cream _ instead of touting better
customer service and lower prices. ``People choose Working Assets
for the ice cream,'' Carbone said. ``That's a bad way to pick a
phone company.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet as a business, Working Assets appears to be a success.
Though it doesn't disclose earnings, revenue soared from $2 million
in 1991 to $140 million last year. It made Inc. Magazine's list of
the fastest-growing companies for five years, though revenue grew
just 8 percent last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The company is very well managed,'' said board member
Elizabeth Sawi, who is also an executive vice president at Schwab.
She said she became a Working Assets customer after running into
Scher at a social gathering, which Scher promptly used to give her
an impromptu sales pitch. Other board members include former Ben &AMP;
Jerry's CEO Fred ``Chico'' Lager and Kay Stepp, a former board
member of the San Francisco Federal Reserve Bank.
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to know whether to judge Working Assets like a
traditional corporation, based on profits and losses, or more like
a nonprofit.
</P>
<P>
   Sawi said Working Assets is unusual because it hopes to be a
``viable business enterprise'' but has made it a central mission to
``do good in society.'' She said she couldn't think of any other
company that lets customers vote on which companies to give money
to.
</P>
<P>
   Yet customers sometimes confuse Working Assets with a charity.
</P>
<P>
   At a party in March, for instance, Working Assets honored
several nonprofits at a lavish restaurant on the waterfront.
Staring at a plateful of shrimp, one couple seemed miffed. ``Is
this what they're spending our money on?'' said the husband, a
longtime Working Assets long-distance customer.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike nonprofits and publicly traded companies, Working Assets
doesn't disclose its top executives' salaries. But Scher, who lives
in Tiburon, said she doesn't believe in the old Ben &AMP; Jerry's
philosophy of refusing to pay any executive more than seven times
what the lowest paid employee earned. Scher declined to be more
specific about her pay.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Working Assets also sparked ill will with its foray
into broadcasting last year. Since it bought a tiny radio station
in Boulder, Colo., for $575,000 and renamed it KWAB (Working Assets
Broadcasting), the station managers have fired at least half the
staff; KWAB has a dozen full-time workers and many more
part-timers.
</P>
<P>
   One morning talk show host, Dani Newsum, said she and her
partner found out they were sacked when they showed up and noticed
their names were missing from the weekly schedule, which had been
posted on a blackboard in the conference room.
</P>
<P>
   ``The radio business is very cutthroat, but I have never heard
of this happening before,'' complained Newsum, who worked for KWAB
for just three months.
</P>
<P>
   Newsum, who now works as a TV producer and teaches at the
University of Colorado, said the news was especially bitter because
Working Assets says its mission is to build ``a world that is more
just (and) humane.''
</P>
<P>
   Other former workers also complained they were treated shabbily
in an article in WestWord, an alternative weekly published in
Denver.
</P>
<P>
   But KWAB Station Manager Chuck Lontine said that posting the
schedule without Newsum's name was simply ``a terrible mistake'' by
another station worker, who also no longer works there.
</P>
<P>
   Lontine said the firings were unfortunate but were necessary as
part of plans to make the 1,000-watt station the flagship for a
nationwide ``progressive'' network.
</P>
<P>
   Lontine said he hopes KWAB's talk-show hosts can go head to head
with more prominent conservative icons such as Oliver North and G.
Gordon Liddy. (KWAB recently featured a speech by Fidel Castro and
an interview with Noam Chomsky.) And while other radio stations
routinely award bundles of cash to lucky callers, KWAB brags that
it gives $5,000 gifts to local nonprofits.
</P>
<P>
   Although KWAB is also broadcast over the Internet (where it
reaches about 500 listeners a day), it is hampered by a weak signal
in Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, Lontine said, the firm hopes to buy a second station
in the Denver area and is eyeing the Bay Area and a few other
activist hotbeds. Working Assets explored buying a low-power
station in Contra Costa County last year but backed out after
learning the station couldn't be moved to Richmond, where the
signal could reach Berkeley and San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Working Assets has also branched into other areas, including
marketing EarthLink's Internet service, setting up an online
shopping mall with 70 partners and reselling Sprint's wireless
phone service. (In each case, it gives a portion of charges to
nonprofits.)
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Working Assets started out as a credit card company.
Every time customers ring up a charge, it gives 10 cents to
charity.
</P>
<P>
   So-called ``affinity cards,'' which often benefit colleges and
other groups, are now common, but the idea was revolutionary in
1985.
</P>
<P>
   Other efforts have been less successful. Working Assets pulled
out of the local-phone market in California two years ago after
losing thousands of dollars. (Scher blamed problems on working with
Pacific Bell.) And it also had trouble marketing electricity in
Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   Today, most of Working Assets' revenue comes from long-distance.
(Working Assets uses Sprint's network but provides its own customer
service.)
</P>
<P>
   To its credit, Working Assets seems to provide good service. The
California Public Utilities Commission received just 11 complaints
about Working Assets last year. Even adjusting for its smaller
size, that's a complaint rate far lower than rivals like AT&AMP;T and
Sprint.
</P>
<P>
   Working Assets also gives a larger percentage of its revenues to
nonprofits than its rivals.
</P>
<P>
   Last year alone, Working Assets gave $2.3 million to nonprofit
causes (or 1.6 percent of sales) and channeled an additional $1.5
million in customer contributions. Working Assets often encourages
customers to round up their bills and forwards the extra money to
nonprofits. (Working Assets normally includes the customer
donations in the amount it says it gave to nonprofits, which
critics say is misleading.)
</P>
<P>
   By comparison, AT&AMP;T gave $123 million to charity in the past two
years or about 0.1 percent of revenue.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Scher said, Working Assets tries to make a difference
in other ways. It plants trees to make up for the paper it uses for
bills. And it uses its bills as sort of a political action letter
to round up grassroots support for liberal causes. Working Assets
even picks up the tab when customers call selected decision-makers
_ ranging from senators and representatives to corporate presidents
_ listed monthly on phone bills.
</P>
<P>
   But Scher said she has no plans to turn the company into a
nonprofit.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to build a successful business,'' she said. ``We want
to be a role model'' for other corporations.
</P>
<P>
   Scher also has no plans to sell stock to the public. (She
wouldn't say who owns the company, though another executive said
employees own many of the shares, while angel investors control the
rest.)
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't think (a stock offering) needs to be a measure of
business success,'' Scher said. Again, she noted, Working Assets
hopes to be a different kind of company.

``The same fragrances that help us transcend stress and anxiety can
move our pets to a higher plane, too,'' says aromatherapist &UR; DeAnn
Lowell &LR; , founder of Peppermint Pets aromatherapy candles for dogs
and their owners.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately for the former, the scents _ lavender, peppermint
and geranium _ seem more geared to the preferences of the latter,
the person who plunks down the cash. Four-legged beneficiaries
might prefer hydrant, hot dog or the canine equivalent of
Obsession, hindquarters-of-a-friend.

   P.P.S. The International Hedgehog Olympic Gymboree was held in
Alsip, Ill., last weekend, sponsored by Pets.com to raise money for

   After  &UR; Keri Russell &LR;  cut her hair, her TV series ``Felicity''
flopped. So the WB network, on which the show was broadcast,
decreed that all its heroines, including &UR; Katie Holmes  &LR; and  &UR; Sarah &LR; 
 &UR; Michelle Gellar &LR; , keep their hair long. ``You don't want to
radically alter the look of a character from one season to the

   Meanwhile, CosmoGirl provides directions for teenagers wishing
to staple their hair, beginning with an inch-wide section from the
front left side: ``Pull it toward your ear and staple (with a
handheld stapler).'' Specifying a handheld staple should prevent
injuries to girls who might otherwise have employed a staple gun;
the directions also suggest stapling ``at least a half inch from

   &UR; Dave Eggers &LR; , whose ``A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering

almost simultaneous death from cancer, donated $100,000 to cancer
research at a fund-raiser for the WebbWaring Institute for Cancer,
Aging and Antioxidant Research in Denver.
</P>
<P>
   Eggers had been asked to speak at the event, said the Denver

   ``I feel like I've been handed all this money,'' he said, ``and

NATION'S SMOG RACE GETS DOWN AND DIRTY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HARRISON SHEPPARD 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; LOS ANGELES _ With only a few weeks left in the race for the
dubious achievement of being America's Smoggiest City, Los Angeles
is only one pollutant-clogged day behind Houston, officials said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   And the race could turn into a dead-heat today.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday was close to being declared a high-ozone day in Los
Angeles, because a monitoring station in the San Bernardino
Mountains reported high readings late in the afternoon. But South
Coast Air Quality Management District officials said they wouldn't
know the full results until today.
</P>
<P>
   It's not, of course, a race that either city wants to win. Los
Angeles held the title for decades until last year. Thanks to
tighter air quality controls in California and especially hot
weather in Texas, Houston, to its chagrin, overtook the City of
Angels for the first time in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   As of Wednesday afternoon, Houston had 38 high-ozone days this
smog season; Los Angeles, 37.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish you all the luck,'' joked Kathy Barton, a spokeswoman
for the Houston Health Department.
</P>
<P>
   The smog title has become something of an issue in the
presidential campaign, where Republican George W. Bush has been
running on his record as Texas governor against Vice President Al
Gore, a staunch environmentalist. It also has become the source of
a lighthearted war of words between the two cities as they ran
tailpipe to tailpipe all summer.
</P>
<P>
   The smog season in Los Angeles winds up by early October, while
it lasts a few additional weeks in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   No matter how the race ends up, however, Houston is likely to
have the single smoggiest day this year, environmental officials
said. The Texas gulf city had a day with 225 parts per billion
concentration of ozone, compared with Los Angeles' peak this season
of 180 ppb.
</P>
<P>
   An unhealthy smog day is declared when the levels at a
monitoring station average at least 130 ppb for an hour.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to tight emissions controls, Los Angeles has already made
enormous improvements since the late 1970s, when it had 208
high-ozone days.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've made steady progress at cleaning the air and that has
shown in the numbers,'' said AQMD spokesman Sam Atwood. ``There
have been blips up and down each year due to the weather, but on
average we've had steady decline of the number of unhealthy air
quality days each year.''
</P>
<P>
   Last summer, Los Angeles also had zero days of Stage One smog
alerts, a more serious problem where the level of ozone reaches 200
ppb, and is unlikely to have any this year, Atwood said.
</P>
<P>
   In the late 1970s, L.A. typically had more than 120 Stage One
smog alerts in a year, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Houston, however, is determined to not keep the crown for too
long.
</P>
<P>
   The state of Texas is holding hearings this week on a
controversial plan to improve air quality in the greater Houston
region by, among other restrictions, lowering highway speeds,
limiting times for using power lawn mowers and limiting the amount
of time large trucks can idle. The plan is expected to generate
strong opposition from business owners and other users of heavy
equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Smog levels are affected not only by the amount of emissions
from vehicles and factories, but also by weather conditions. Hot,
sunny days with few breezes foster the chemical reactions that
increase smog in the air -- part of the reason that Houston, which
has had an unusual number of high temperature days this summer is
still ahead of Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Barton noted that Houston also has a high number of industrial
sites around the city, especially in the petroleum industry, as
well as hot, windless weather at the end of summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We crank out a bunch of (volatile organic compounds),'' Barton
said. ``When you're cranking out VOCs, you're going to pay the
price.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   Voter attitudes toward Rick Lazio have turned markedly more
negative since June, with suburban women now moving solidly toward
Hillary Rodham Clinton and many New Yorkers saying Lazio came
across as harsh and inexperienced in his debate with Clinton last
week, according to the latest New York Times/CBS News poll.
</P>
<P>
   The survey, which began last Thursday and was completed on
Tuesday night, suggested deterioration in Lazio's standing at the
time that most politicians believe that voters are beginning
serious consideration of the choice before them in the race for
Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton now has a 9-point lead over her opponent, with 48
percent to Lazio's 39 percent. The remaining voters are undecided
or are supporting minor-party candidates.
</P>
<P>
   In the last Times/CBS poll, taken in June, Clinton had a 5-point
lead over Lazio, who had just entered the race.
</P>
<P>
   When the undecided voters were encouraged to express which way
they were leaning, and their probable votes were added to the
totals, Clinton broke the 50 percent barrier in the most recent
poll, something of a milestone in this race, leading Lazio by 51
percent to 41 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The poll was taken starting the evening after the debate in
Buffalo, an encounter that seems to have enhanced Clinton's
standing, at least for the time being. Nearly half of the poll
respondents who saw the debate pronounced Clinton the winner. The
candidates are to meet in at least two more debates.
</P>
<P>
   And there is, as aides to both candidates noted on Wednesday,
plenty of time left, in a contest that will not end for six weeks,
particularly given the relatively large number of voters who remain
undecided.
</P>
<P>
   If history is any guide, most of those voters are likely in the
end to favor Lazio, the way they would choose a challenger over an
incumbent, because Clinton is already so well known that voters
have solidly formed opinions about her.
</P>
<P>
   The Times/CBS News poll sketched an electoral landscape that now
seems daunting for the four-term Republican congressman from
Suffolk County who, like Clinton, is running for statewide office
for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   Potentially of most concern to Lazio is the growing support for
Clinton among a group of voters that has been worrying the first
lady's advisers: suburban women. Lazio was leading among those
voters by 43 percent to 36 percent in June. Now, she has the
support of 54 percent of suburban women, compared to 38 percent for
Lazio.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, Clinton has the support of 56 percent of women in all
areas of the state who describe themselves as moderate. In June,
she and Lazio were tied among those voters.
</P>
<P>
   Among the reasons for Clinton's improved standing with those
female voters, the poll findings suggest, was the aggressive
posture Lazio struck toward Clinton at the debate in Buffalo. That
episode has clearly emerged as a watershed in this campaign, since
it was the first time so many viewers had an opportunity to view a
candidate whom most people did not know before the summer.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio attacked her at almost every question, and at the end, he
walked over to her lectern, demanding that she sign a piece of
paper renouncing the use of soft-money campaign contributions.
</P>
<P>
   Among women who watched the debate, half of the poll respondents
said that Lazio did not display the requisite maturity and
experience to serve in the United States Senate. Half also said
that Clinton had won the debate, compared to just 26 percent who
said Lazio won.
</P>
<P>
   Men who watched the debate had a more favorable reaction to
Lazio's performance. Still, overall, 54 percent of respondents who
viewed it said that Lazio was too aggressive, compared to just 4
percent who said the same thing about Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the aggressiveness and downgrading that Lazio showed
during the debate that did it for me,'' Marie Harvey, 75, a medical
secretary from New Hyde Park who had been undecided, said in a
follow-up interview. ``I had never heard him speak for any length
of time before that. I thought Lazio should have come out with more
of his background in Congress instead of attacking her husband's
actions. I was surprised that Hillary Clinton displayed so much
poise and control during the debate.''  &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (MORE) &QL; 
 &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   According to the poll, Lazio's difficulties go beyond women
voters. Respondents who now hold an unfavorable view of Lazio have
nearly tripled, to 28 percent, since 10 percent in the last poll,
while his favorable rating is 33 percent, up from 26 percent in
June.
</P>
<P>
   Four in 10 respondents describe Lazio as conservative, a
13-point jump since June, suggesting that Clinton has achieved some
success in linking Lazio with conservative members of Congress,
like former Speaker Newt Gingrich. There has also been a sharp jump
in the number of voters who believe Lazio is spending more time
attacking his opponent than explaining his positions, and more
voters believe that he is running a more negative campaign than
Clinton is. That might complicate any attempt by Lazio to turn up
the volume of his attacks, as he is planning to do over the next
six weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The poll was conducted among 1,212 registered voters, of whom
1,066 were characterized as likely to vote. It has a margin of
sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   The Times/CBS poll also found that in the presidential race in
New York, the Democrat, Al Gore, is leading George W. Bush, the
Republican, by nearly two-to-one. That, too, is unwelcome news for
Lazio, since it almost certain means that Bush will not devote time
or money to this state, and that the Democratic turnout could be
particularly high for Gore. In a contest roughly analogous to this
one, when Robert F. Kennedy moved from Massachusetts to New York
State and run for Senator in 1964, Kennedy won in no small part
because Lyndon B. Johnson was elected president with a 2.4 million
vote margin in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is now doing extremely well in New York City, with about
70 percent of the vote. A strong showing there is essential for any
Democrat running for statewide office. By contrast, upstate, the
Republican stronghold in New York, Lazio has the support of about
half the voters, which is probably below what a Republican
candidate needs to win a statewide race.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio's advisers disputed the findings of the Times/CBS poll,
and said their own polls showed the race to be tighter, and they
were pleased with the candidate's performance to date and confident
of his victory. ``I hope Clinton believes this poll,'' said Mike
Murphy, Lazio's consultant. ``She's in for a big surprise on
Election Day.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's pollster, Mark Penn, said the findings reflected his
polls, and asserted they represented a rebuke to the way Lazio has
conducted his campaign. ``It shows that the voters rejected the
campaign of insults that Rick Lazio launched almost since the
moment he entered the race,'' Penn said. ``I think further it shows
that people are finding out more about Lazio and more about his
record.''
</P>
<P>
   The dynamics of the election have clearly shifted since the last
Times/CBS poll, in June, when Lazio first stepped both into the
race to replace Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, and into a statistical tie
with the first lady. The change over the summer has largely been to
Clinton's benefit, though her successes would appear, in no small
measure, to be a consequence of difficulties Lazio has encountered.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton remains where she has been for much of the year:
hovering with between 45 and 49 percent of the vote, with about
one-third of the voters expressing an unfavorable opinion of her.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Lazio is no longer the little-known quantity he
once was, and that might not be entirely to his benefit. At 28
percent, his unfavorable rating is nearly as high as Clinton's,
which is 32 percent. And the poll found that 46 percent of New
Yorkers say that Lazio cares ``about the needs and problems of
people like yourself,'' double what that was in June, while 56
percent said they believed Clinton cares about their problems.

HUSBAND FULLY SUPPORTS BUCKNER DAVIS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BONDI BEACH, Australia _ She's in a country where females are
always girls and the national vitamin is testosterone.
</P>
<P>
   So Annett Buckner Davis understands if some old-school Aussies
are clucking their tongues right now and telling their mates at the
pub that she really ought to be home nursing the ego of her
husband, who failed in his Olympic bid, instead of reveling in her
own moment, literally under the sun.
</P>
<P>
   Buckner Davis and partner Jenny Johnson Jordan won a
second-round match today in the Olympic two-person beach volleyball
competition against a rising young Cuban pair who can approach
Buckner Davis' and Johnson Jordan's athleticism, if not their
experience.
</P>
<P>
   One more win and the No. 2-ranked pair in the world is assured
an Olympic medal of one color or another. Cheering them every dig
of the way is Byron Davis, who finished 16th in the 100-meter
butterfly at the U.S. Olympic Swimming Trials in August.
</P>
<P>
   A month before Davis missed qualifying to compete in Sydney,
Buckner Davis and Johnson Jordan _ both of whom are from Tarzana _
made it by virtue of finishing as the top-ranked U.S. team over a
two-year qualifying period.
</P>
<P>
   It can become terribly awkward sharing the same dream and a
house, too, when the dream becomes a reality for one partner and
not the other. Swimmer B.J. Bedford has been on both sides of the
scenario. She missed making the 1996 Olympic team by one spot while
her boyfriend (now fiance) Tom Sorensen competed in Atlanta as a
member of the U.S. men's indoor volleyball team.
</P>
<P>
   Bedford remembers eavesdropping on an interview Sorensen was
doing with a reporter in 1996 so she'd know how he felt about being
an Olympian; Sorensen wouldn't talk about it with her for fear it
would be adding salt to her raw wound.
</P>
<P>
   Four years later, Bedford earned an Olympic berth in the 100
backstroke right after Sorensen became one of the final cuts from
the U.S. Olympic volleyball team. He was at the swimming trials
when Bedford won the 100-meter backstroke. Said Bedford, ``He had
tears running down his face. That was the most joyous moment for
me. We both exalt when the other does well.''
</P>
<P>
   Buckner Davis, who turns 28 on Saturday, said she and Byron are
the same way. He lets her know how happy and proud he is of her,
which in turn allows Buckner Davis to throw herself into the whole
experience of being an Olympian rather than having to tiptoe
through it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It hasn't been very hard,'' Buckner Davis said, ``because I
know how excited he is for me.''
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Buckner Davis got Byron a day pass to the Olympic
athletes' village and together they took in all the sights and
sounds on the grounds. It was the next best thing to marching
side-by-side in the opening ceremonies.
</P>
<P>
   ``He kind of got to experience everything with me,'' Buckner
Davis said.
</P>
<P>
   Buckner Davis and Johnson Jordan, who is married to ex-UCLA
football player Kevin Jordan, are proof that behind every great
woman is a good man.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is different than most of the other guys,'' Buckner Davis
said of her husband. ``He's so supportive of me. That's definitely
one of the things that attracted me to him. Not everyone can do
that. Not everyone can take a backseat when their partner is in the
spotlight.''
</P>
<P>
   Not that she expects everybody in a country that calls women
``sheilas'' to understand that.

that resembled stripped lug nuts, testing a slow-healing Achilles'
tendon that left him in dark moods.
</P>
<P>
   All the while, he was craning his neck, eavesdropping on a

Just a harmless update. That is when the 7-foot curmudgeon turned
to Childs and snapped, ``Don't be talking about my business.''
</P>
<P>
   This was Ewing the New York Knick. There was always a No
Trespassing sign posted on his life, and very few gained entrance
into his personal space. For the players who were loyal props for
his bravado _ like John Starks and Herb Williams _ he made an
exception. Otherwise, it was Keep Out.
</P>
<P>
   For years, the Madison Square Garden management and the Knicks'
coaching staff were the enablers to his rock-star behavior. The
Garden's president, Dave Checketts, paid him to extremes, coach
Jeff Van Gundy praised him to no end and everyone allowed Ewing to
separate himself from the rest.
</P>
<P>
   Under the Ewing rules, he picked the luxury hotels and gave the
nod to the flight plans. His high maintenance was legendary. At
least once, he demanded that a flight attendant shake his orange
juice for him on the team plane.
</P>
<P>
   As long as he was the franchise player, everyone accepted
Ewing's supreme existence, including his teammates. But when
Ewing's guarantees became increasingly hollow last season, when he
failed to grasp the reality of his own decline, his teammates
became less reverent and more resentful.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with the trade of Ewing to Seattle, there will be a silent
cheer from his former teammates. They may not voice it publicly,
but Allan Houston, Latrell Sprewell, Larry Johnson, Childs and a
few others, found Ewing's stubborn inability to see himself as a
role player inhibiting to the team's success.
</P>
<P>
   By the time the Knicks were eliminated in six games at the hands
of the Indiana Pacers' Reggie Miller, Ewing's teammates were not
hailing his greatness; they were quietly questioning his presence.
Just two years earlier, Ewing stood in the Knicks' locker room and
playfully proclaimed, ``This is my Garden.''
</P>
<P>
   Last season, he was more like a stranger on the scene. Here is
how desperate things had become for him: His only close friend on
the team, the forgettable Mursad Turkcan, was gone by year's end.
</P>
<P>
   ``He chose to be a loner,'' one Knicks teammate said when the
trade speculation began this summer. ``He wanted everyone to say,
`Yeah, Pat, you're still great.' And no one did.''
</P>
<P>
   So it was not a surprise when Ewing consented to be traded. It
was just jarring. When the Ewing-free Knicks step on the Garden
floor this year, it will be like going to an old neighborhood and
finding a Best Buy on the site of the corner market.
</P>
<P>
   It will seem strange.
</P>
<P>
   But for some Knicks, it will feel liberating. In some ways, Van
Gundy is included in that group.
</P>
<P>
   Although Ewing believed he was unappreciated by the
organization, and led astray by the medical staff about his
Achilles' tendon tear, he may have been most disappointed in Van
Gundy.
</P>
<P>
   As last season unfolded, Van Gundy still pumped up Ewing's
greatness, but usually in the past tense. At times, Van Gundy
benched Ewing in the fourth quarter, called game-ending plays for
others on the floor and began the process of moving beyond their
post-up style.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, those close to Ewing say he felt betrayed by Van
Gundy. But as Van Gundy often said, one of the most difficult
tricks in sports is coaching a superstar on the decline.
Ultimately, Van Gundy's preseason prediction came true, ``It could
really end ugly for Patrick.''
</P>
<P>
   It did. Players saw him as an outdated part in the scheme, a
horse-and-buggy to their fast-lane ways. They whispered that Ewing
held them back, cramped their style and weighed down the offense.
</P>
<P>
   And then there was the playoff stat that became a catch phrase:
The Knicks were 5-1 over two playoff runs against the Pacers
without Ewing. When brought to his attention, the candid Sprewell
was honest enough to say what other Knicks were thinking: ``Numbers
don't lie.''
</P>
<P>
   But the numbers really didn't matter. Even before their final
playoff series, the players had already a love-hate relationship
with Ewing. Although they constantly looked for Ewing to bail them
out as the shot clock ran out and relied on their aging center to
grab the rebounds while they eagerly escaped the contact, some
players believed he was an albatross around their neck. Upon
elimination, after what ended up to be Ewing's final crestfallen
exit from the Garden, there was only halfhearted sympathy for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's unfair for people to criticize him, but that's life,''
Houston said. ``You do the best you can, and that's what Patrick
does.''
</P>
<P>
   Ewing's effort was always there. No one disputed that. But at
some point, perception became the reality. Once the players
believed Ewing suppressed their chances of victory, the losses
seemed to occur almost subconsciously.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the alibi has been removed, the target of blame is gone. As
Ewing exits, he will turn over the keys to the team. This is what
the Knicks wanted. And in many ways, with Ewing's animosity toward
the organization growing, with his teammates carefully trying to
step around his fragile ego, this is the way it had to end.
</P>
<P>
   But at some point, as the clock winds down on a game in April,
the same teammates who privately resented him will be looking for
the irascible No. 33.
</P>
<P>
   Stubborn as he was, ego-driven as he remained, he would take the
last shot, absorb the criticism and never shrink from a challenge.
At some point, the Knicks will miss the grumpy old man. &QL;

TE KANAWA OPENS PHILHARMONIC SEASON 
</HEADLINE>
   By BERNARD HOLLAND    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Rarely has the New York Philharmonic opened a season
with so many loose ends dangling. The search for a new conductor is
still frustrated. A deeply unsatisfactory hall awaits total
overhaul. And an existing music director, Kurt Masur, lingers
somewhere between his bruised relationship with a former
Philharmonic management and some kind of part-time status in the
future. The only encouraging certainty is Zarin Mehta, a newly
installed executive director who just might make order out of
existing chaos.
</P>
<P>
   So Wednesday night's program at Avery Fisher Hall _ led by Masur
in a space brightly lighted for a national television audience and
played before a dressed-up constituency primed for postconcert
feasting _ had the character of comfort food for the ear. Problems
were deferred, at least for an evening.
</P>
<P>
   Benign, beloved and seemingly indestructible was Dame Kiri Te
Kanawa, singing such heart-tuggers as ``Ach, ich fuehl's'' from
Mozart's ``Zauberfloete'' and the last scene of Strauss'
``Arabella.'' Mendelssohn's ever-famous ``Italian'' Symphony,
Strauss' perpetually endearing ``Till Eulenspiegel'' and more from
``Die Zauberfloete'' _ its eternally popular overture _ made
certain that attention spans would not be unfairly challenged.
</P>
<P>
   The Mendelssohn served the double purpose of introducing a more
serious survey of the composer's music beginning Thursday night and
continuing over the next few weeks. The choral pieces, along with
all the Incidental Music to ``A Midsummer Night's Dream'' next week
should be particularly interesting.
</P>
<P>
   Dame Kiri looked terrific, some of the nicest parts of her voice
are still operating well, and Wednesday night she chose wisely. The
``Arabella'' sequence is quiet and brief for an operatic finale,
and also uncharacteristically calm. Strauss' writing is not
violently demanding, but it extends this singer's vocal assets
about as far as they will reach these days. One felt the pressure
in the music's relatively few climaxes, and heard a singer who has
done a lot of singing in her time carefully hoarding her strength
and avoiding danger. Elsewhere the musical difficulties had more to
do with elegance than with brute power, and she handled them well.
</P>
<P>
   We have learned not to expect particularly deep thoughts from
this singer. For some performers, the beauty of the voice is a
conduit, something that allows what is inside to come out. For Dame
Kiri, the beauty is the voice itself. We may not have felt the pain
of ``Ach, ich fuehl's'' or the confusion of the other Mozart aria,
``Vado, ma dove?'' but what we did hear was a singer in love with
the sound of herself. The delicate Strauss encore, ``Morgen,'' was
a further suggestion that to operate on the surface is not
necessarily to be shallow. Glenn Dicterow played the violin solo
beautifully.
</P>
<P>
   The Philharmonic was in a good mood: bright, shiny and
responsive. Masur takes the ``Italian'' Symphony at a walking pace,
replacing excitability with leisurely good spirits. ``Till
Eulenspiegel'' was all steel and high polish.
</P>
<P>
   This may be the most urban of all the world's major orchestras.
If the sound of the Vienna Philharmonic strings makes one think of
swaying chestnut trees and green fields, the New York Philharmonic
is more like the Chrysler Building: sharp angles and splendid
engineering, and no less beautiful because of them.

 Hadassah Lieberman works to achieve `balancing act' in campaign  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE KRASKE  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star   KANSAS CITY _ Two years ago this month,
Sen. Joseph Lieberman was about to step onto the floor of the U.S.
Senate to condemn the president of the United States.
<TEXT>
<P>
   And the senator's wife, Hadassah Freilich Lieberman, was scared.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `Why are you doing this?' &UR; '' Lieberman said on a visit
Wednesday to Kansas City. ``I was just afraid. I told him as a
daughter of an immigrant, it just puzzled me.''
</P>
<P>
   But the man most Americans now know as the running mate to
Democratic presidential nominee Al Gore went ahead with his speech,
decrying Clinton's conduct with Monica Lewinsky as ``immoral.''
</P>
<P>
   Coming from a Democrat, the speech put Lieberman on the national
map and changed the tenor of the public debate about how the
president's conduct should be addressed.
</P>
<P>
   For Lieberman's wife, the days approaching the speech were a
trying time. As the child of Holocaust survivors who came to the
United States from Czechoslovakia, she found the idea of attacking
a president abhorrent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just felt like we came to this country from such a horrible
past...and there's a certain kind of humility in a way,'' she told
/{The Kansas City Star/} in an interview. ``I just thought we're so
lucky that the United States took us in, and here's the president
of the United States. You can't criticize him.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just sort of the way I had been raised.''
</P>
<P>
   Her Kansas City stop came as part of a daylong trip to Missouri
in which the 52-year-old also visited St. Louis. The trip came as
another reminder of the importance the presidential campaigns place
on Missouri, regarded as a crucial battleground state.
</P>
<P>
   In Kansas City, Lieberman attended a fund-raiser for the
Missouri Democratic Party and toured a child-care center at 3800 E.
51st St.
</P>
<P>
   Accompanied by her son, Ethan Tucker, 24, Lieberman read the
book, /{Brown Bear, Brown Bear, What Do You See?/} to about a dozen
3- to 5-year-olds. Sitting in front of a wall that displayed
several watercolor paintings in bright blues, pinks and yellows,
Lieberman demonstrated a politician's acumen when she started to
promise she would return someday to read a second book.
</P>
<P>
   She hesitated, then said, ``I promise I'll try to come back,''
which fell short of a full-bore pledge.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman, who referred to her husband as ``Joey,'' said she was
working hard to avoid speculating about life after the election.
But if her husband becomes vice president, Lieberman said, she
would focus on women's health and education as her chief public
issues.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, she has had several part-time jobs since her
husband won election to the Senate in 1988. She worked for the
National Research Council promoting education programs and for a
public-relations firm.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman described her role as a ``delicate balancing act'' in
which she hoped to give voters a sense about who she and her
husband are without embarrassing the ticket.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's their race...They're the candidates,'' Lieberman said of
her husband and Gore. ``I hope I can be helpful. I'm not under any
delusions that I'm really going to change that many votes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just know I have to do what feels right. I have to go out
there and do the right thing.''

PAHL TO CONTINUE MISSION AT USC
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LEE BARNATHAN  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ While many volleyball players spend their summer
practicing, Jennifer Pahl spent part of hers riding elephants,
assisting in operations on elephants, bathing elephants and
rehabilitating elephants.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, Pahl played some volleyball, too, but 10 days in Sri Lanka
gave her an appreciation for many things elephant.
</P>
<P>
   Pahl, a USC junior middle blocker, leads the 7-0 and top-ranked
Trojans (Volleyball Magazine poll) with 1.2 blocks per game,
ranking her second in the Pac-10 Conference. She's also hitting
.391, ranking her third in the Pac-10, and the team has won 21
consecutive games and needs only to sweep Stanford and Cal to tie
the school record.
</P>
<P>
   But those current details pale compared to Pahl's recent past,
when she spent time in Sri Lanka in a program sponsored by Athletes
In Action, a Christian organization using athletics to spread
Christianity.
</P>
<P>
   She also experienced anti-Christian sentiment in Sri Lanka and
spent 10 days in Hong Kong towering over the 4-foot-7 players she
encountered there (Pahl is 6-1). But it was the times with the
animals Pahl recalls most fondly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was loving every minute of it,'' she said. ``The trunk
seemed separated from the elephant because it's so alive.''
</P>
<P>
   In Sri Lanka, elephants are used to transport people or heavy
loads, such as lumber. So when an elephant is injured (one elephant
had a tumor in its leg), it's a big deal.
</P>
<P>
   But to operate on an elephant, it must be tranquilized. This
particular elephant fell on the side of the tumor, meaning it would
have to be lifted. For 15 minutes, Pahl, four AIA teammates and
five Sri Lankans lent their strength.
</P>
<P>
   ``My arms have never been so tired,'' Pahl said. ``It was
fascinating. I enjoyed it.''
</P>
<P>
   She also enjoyed ministering to the people of Sri Lanka and Hong
Kong and had some success at converting. About 25 Sri Lankans
expressed interest in knowing more, which surprised Pahl
considering the anti-Christian factions.
</P>
<P>
   In Sri Lanka, she learned, there are some churches, but
missionaries aren't welcomed. Athletes In Action spends between
games and after matches spreading the words of Christ, but that
wasn't always possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were a couple of days we went to play some matches, and
so many anti-Christian groups were there,'' she said, ``so we
couldn't do many open testimonies.''
</P>
<P>
   In Hong Kong, Pahl found a friendlier atmosphere, which included
several people who practiced Christianity in secret for fear of
upsetting their Buddhist parents.
</P>
<P>
   Those people also were eager to find out how Pahl grew so tall.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have pictures of girls 4-7, and I'm standing next to them.
It looks like the Guinness Book of World Records for tallest
girl,'' Pahl said. ``In Hong Kong, they'd run up to me (and say),
`How do you get so tall?' `My parents are tall.' `What else? What
else?' `I eat my vegetables. I don't know what to tell you.' ''
</P>
<P>
   When she returned, USC interim coach Jerritt Elliott noticed a
change. Pahl had become more accountable and more competitive.
</P>
<P>
   ``Her eyes were opened for the first time,'' Elliott said. ``She
was a pretty sheltered kid. This was the first time she saw how
fortunate she is. She has a great appreciation.''

GLADSTONE, MO., WOMAN WINS MILLION DOLLARS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BILL GRAHAM  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY _ Geraldine Zollars is a survivor but she didn't
need a desert island nor a snappy answer for Regis Philbin to win a
million dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Zollars, 66, of Gladstone, Mo., became a millionaire on
Wednesday the old-fashioned way _ she won a Reader's Digest
Sweepstakes grand prize.
</P>
<P>
   Not bad for a grandmother who, as a single mother decades ago,
worked days as a secretary and nights as a waitress to support her
family. Then rheumatoid arthritis forced her into early retirement.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still can't even think in these kind of dollar figures,''
Zollars said. ``It's a blessing. I don't know why I have been
blessed this way. There's so many more people who are more
deserving. But I do have a wonderful family.''
</P>
<P>
   The prize was a surprise.
</P>
<P>
   Zollars said over the years she bought numerous books, musical
compact discs and videos for her grandchildren from Reader's
Digest. But she paid little attention to the information that the
purchases counted as a contest entry.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like the old music,'' she said. ``I was a '50s child.''
</P>
<P>
   She was shocked when a registered letter arrived informing her
that she'd better sit down because she was a million-dollar winner.
</P>
<P>
   Reader's Digest runs several sweepstakes and contests throughout
the year with varying prizes and entry deadlines, said Donna
Pierpont, a public relations manager for the publishing and direct
marketing company based in Pleasantville, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   The money was wired to her bank account at the Mazuma Credit
Union in Gladstone on Tuesday. Zollars found out she was a winner
two weeks ago but kept the award a secret at the request of
Reader's Digest.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, she was given a 3-foot-long symbolic $1.1 million
check by Pierpont during a ceremony in the Mazuma Credit Union
lobby.
</P>
<P>
   Zollars accepted the check with bright eyes and a nervous smile
with help from her son, Richard Engel, and daughter, Jody Sears,
both of Kansas City, North.
</P>
<P>
   ``She (Zollars) was pretty much struggling when my sister Sue
and I were kids, after she had divorced my dad,'' Engel said.
``Money was tight. She pretty much worked three or four jobs all
the time. It was an uphill battle. So we're all real happy for
her.''
</P>
<P>
   Zollars became a manager with the Denny's Restaurant chain in
the 1970s. But the rheumatoid arthritis ended her career two
decades ago. She had received disability pay until she turned 65
and then worried that her children would have to help support her.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Zollars will now set up college funds for her seven
grandchildren, who range in age from 11 months to 13 years old.
</P>
<P>
   Federal and state taxes will get $500,000 of the lump sum
payment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I checked on that first thing,'' Zollars said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there's enough windfall left to change her life. The
first order of business after Wednesday's ceremony was lunch, on
grandma's tab.
</P>
<P>
   ``This doesn't feel real,'' Zollars said. ``One of these days
I'm afraid I'll wake up.''
</P>
<P>
   A grandson tugged at her arm and said, ``I like your card,''
referring to the mock check.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like my card, too,'' Zollars said.
</P>
<P>
   Then she watched as six of her grandchildren played in the
lobby.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is really just frosting on the cake,'' Zollars said,
``because I already had everything else, my family.''

STOWERS AND OTHERS ALTER DUTIES AT AMERICAN CENTURY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK DAVIS  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star   KANSAS CITY _ James E. Stowers III
stepped aside Wednesday as chief executive officer at American
Century Investments and took on help overseeing managers of the
company's largest group of mutual funds.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Each move was aimed at giving Stowers more time to spend on
investments, innovations in the investment process and new
products. He was also named Wednesday as co-chairman of the Kansas
City-based company with his father, founder James E. Stowers Jr.
</P>
<P>
   William Lyons, who has been president since 1997, became chief
executive officer.
</P>
<P>
   Lyons' added title recognizes that he ``executes the mission of
the company'' and ``has demonstrated he's the leader of the
business,'' the younger Stowers said. ``I think we've had a
sheriff, but he hasn't had his badge.''
</P>
<P>
   American Century also announced Wednesday that C. Kim Goodwin
had become co-chief investment officer with the younger Stowers of
the company's domestic growth stock funds. They will share the duty
of overseeing the nine domestic growth stock funds that account for
60 percent of the $120 billion in assets American Century manages.
</P>
<P>
   The group includes the American Century Ultra Fund, the
company's largest fund, and the American Century Growth Fund, for
which Goodwin is the senior manager. She will remain senior manager
of the Growth Fund.
</P>
<P>
   Stowers said his many duties kept him from providing as much
assistance to growth fund managers as he would like and from
spending as much time as he would like overseeing investments and
developing products and investment systems.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got distracted constantly by the needs of these portfolio
managers,'' Stowers said. ``I personally have not done a good
enough job.''
</P>
<P>
   Fund industry consultant Geoff Bobroff said the moves reflected
the increasingly complex business of asset management as well as
the culture of shared responsibilities at American Century.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a logical move for them,'' Bobroff said.
</P>
<P>
   American Century, he said, has been active in supporting
electronic stock exchanges, has pursued new ways to sell its mutual
funds and has tackled other activities apart from picking winning
investments.
</P>
<P>
   Bobroff said it made sense to give the chief executive's title
to Lyons because of his past work as general counsel of the company
and his work as president.
</P>
<P>
   Goodwin's new position is equal to that of three other chief
investment officers for different types of funds at American
Century.
</P>
<P>
   Henrik Strabo is chief investment officer for the international
funds, Randy Merk holds the same title for the fixed income funds,
and Mark Mallon holds that title for the value and quantitative
funds.
</P>
<P>
   All report to Bob Puff, who is chief investment officer for the
entire family of funds.
</P>
<P>
   Goodwin also joined the investment oversight committee, a group
of senior managers who monitor the performance of the company's
stock and bond investments.
</P>
<P>
   Goodwin joined American Century in 1997. She had been with
Putnam Investments.

PASSING GAME NOT AS TIGHT AS CAN BE
</HEADLINE>

 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ There's been plenty of speculation about whether
USC tight end Antoine Harris will see another pass this season
after his critical drop against Colorado. Check that. There's been
speculation over how many receptions any tight ends will make based
on the first two games.
</P>
<P>
   USC tight ends have caught just three passes this season and
more people remember Harris' drop than his receptions because it
almost cost the Trojans a chance to beat Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   With USC facing a fourth-and-5 situation at the Colorado 34 with
4:32 left, quarterback Carson Palmer rolled right and found Harris
wide open. The pass was perfect, but Harris dropped it.
</P>
<P>
   Harris said he isn't concerned about losing opportunities based
on that mistake.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't worried about a thing like that. Next time, I'm
making sure to look at it and secure it and bounce back,'' Harris
said. ``Since we don't get many balls, you have to make every one
count.''
</P>
<P>
   And what if people expect him to drop passes?
</P>
<P>
   ``That's good,'' Harris said. ``That's the added pressure I
need. I've just been making sure I've been catching it in
practice.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though highly touted freshman Alex Holmes and junor college
transfer Doyal Butler did not play against Colorado, USC coach Paul
Hackett said he will begin to use the tight ends more in the next
few games.
</P>
<P>
   ``That will be an important development in our offense over the
next month,'' Hackett said. ``Antoine Harris continues to be the
mainstay, but those other guys can do it, too.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Guenther to have surgery: Freshman tight end Gregg Guentherof
Taft High will require surgery for a herniated disc in his back,
causing him to redshirt. The surgery will also jeopardize the
6-foot-8 Guenther's plans to play basketball this season.
</P>
<P>
   Guenther, who is expected to return for spring practice, is
believed to have suffered the injury before he reported to USC.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was something apparently that has been there,'' Hackett
said. ``And when you remember how hard he's worked at USC, it's
just flared back up.''
</P>
<P>
   As previously reported, Guenther joins offensive lineman Joe
McGuire (herniated disc), tailback Chris Howard (reconstructive
knee surgery) and strong safety Matt Grootegoed (mononucleosis) as
freshmen forced toredshirt for medical reasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``Four years from now we'll talk about what a wonderful
situation we'rein, but right now I think it hurts our team,''
Hackett said.
</P>
<P>
   __ Sultan sits: Tailback Sultan McCullough sat out
Wednesday'spractice with the flu, but Hackett expects him to be 100
percent for the San Jose State game on Saturday. Fullback Chad
Pierson also sat out with a strained calf.
</P>
<P>
   Tailback Malaefou MacKenzie, who has been bothered with
hamstring and ankle problems, had his best practice since training
camp, according to Hackett.
</P>
<P>
   With McGuire out, Jacob Rogers will play tackle on goal-line
situations and is backed up by another freshman, Nate Steinbacher.
</P>
<P>
   __ Secret weapon: Punter Mike MacGillivray is averaging 47.0
yards per kick, which would tie him for third-best in the nation,
but he is not eligible because he has punted only five times in two
games. The NCAA requires 3.6 punts per game to be eligible in the
statistics.
</P>
<P>
   __ Game ready?: After days worrying about the effects of a
bye,Hackett said he believes the Trojans are desperate to play a
game. Hecanceled practicing in pads today to avoid any possible
injuries.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the signs are we're hungry to play and we want to get
going,'' Hackett said. ``I think it's becoming obvious that we're
anxious.''

INTANGIBLES COMPLICATE WORK ETHICS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE STAFFORD  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star   KANSAS CITY _ To those who see ethical
decisions as clear choices between black and white, Albert Erisman
recommends a second look. Technology, he says, has painted a wide
gray swath in the middle.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sure, it's easy to decide, ``Shall I raid the company vault
tonight?'' But what about, ``Shall I use my company-issued laptop
to surf the Web?''
</P>
<P>
   Erisman, co-founder of the Institute for Business, Technology
and Ethics, says ethical decisions are squishier in the high-tech
knowledge economy, where corporate assets aren't always tangible
and the distinction between what belongs to the company and what
belongs to the employee is blurred.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, it might have been easy to write a workplace rule
that said theft of widgets off the assembly line was a fireable
offense. But when the product is an intangible _ such as knowledge
_ it's difficult for a company to prohibit a worker from walking
out the door with it, Erisman says.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, he suggests, it's no longer clear for many workers
what constitutes work time and what constitutes personal time. And,
while that might not be what some consider an ethical issue, it
certainly raises questions about what is the right thing to do in
terms of compensable hours.
</P>
<P>
   Erisman, who lectured last week at Johnson County Community
College on the new realm of business ethics, took vacation days
from his management job at The Boeing Co. to visit the Kansas City
area and promote awareness of his virtual ethics institute.
</P>
<P>
   For him, in that instance, there was a clear distinction between
work time and personal time. But whose time is it, he asked, when
you return a client's phone call in your car on the way to your
son's football game or read company e-mail from your home at night?
</P>
<P>
   Erisman hopes his 2-year-old ethics institute (Ethix.org on the
Internet) encourages second looks at corporate ethics policies _
``with an eye to fluidity rather than rigidity.''
</P>
<P>
   What he means is that it may be counterproductive, for example,
for employers to ban employees' personal use of company technology.
Stealing is stealing, whether it's widgets or Internet access time.
But organizations need to understand the overriding economic value
of employee loyalty and work//life balance.
</P>
<P>
   If there isn't some squish in the workplace rules, Erisman
opines, it can lead to employees who turn off their beepers, clock
out at quittin' time and say, ``They don't pay me to think.''
</P>
<P>
   Workers, of course, should live up to their ethical end of the
bargain when they navigate the gray area of decision-making.
Neither employer nor employee should misappropriate assets that
belong to the other. And always, Erisman says, there should be
thoughtful consideration of what constitutes the highest good.
</P>
<P>
   ``Plain old-fashioned ethics still apply. There's still right
and wrong. Nothing's changed in that regard,'' Erisman said. ``But
there are more subtle ways of violating privacy, violating trust
and misusing assets. We can't let the fast pace of change take away
our time for reflection and communication about these issues.''

HARD WORDS AND HARDER PLAY HELP METS SNAP OUT OF IT
</HEADLINE>
  By TYLER KEPNER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The risk with calling a team meeting, New York Mets
manager Bobby Valentine said, is that the momentum of the team can
change. That is why meetings do not take place when things are
going well. When times are bleak, a few stern words can do no harm.
</P>
<P>
   Valentine told his players on Tuesday they were too good to be
playing so badly. Wednesday night, Valentine intimated to reporters
that he would not be back next year if the Mets missed the
playoffs. Strong words all around, and the Mets responded with
strong play.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets beat the Atlanta Braves, 6-3, and they earned it. The
Braves left the bases loaded in the sixth, seventh and eighth
innings, with Al Leiter, John Franco and Armando Benitez getting
out of the jams. Leiter worked 5 1/3 perfect innings to start the
game, and improved to 16-7.
</P>
<P>
   Edgardo Alfonzo was 3 for 5 with two doubles and a home run, and
two Mets who have struggled this month _ Mike Piazza and Todd Zeile
_ also hit bases-empty homers.
</P>
<P>
   It was the Mets' first victory in nine September games at Turner
Field over the last three years, and it cut the Braves' lead in the
National League East to four games over the Mets, with 10 to play.
The Mets, who lost to the Braves on Monday and Tuesday, led Arizona
by 5 1/2 games in the wild-card race before the Diamondbacks played
in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Leiter issued two one-out walks in the seventh, then jammed Walt
Weiss, who blooped a single to left. Javy Lopez scored to cut the
Mets' lead to 3-2, but the rookie left fielder Timo Perez, a
defensive replacement, fired to second base to get Reggie Sanders,
who was scrambling back to the bag.
</P>
<P>
   That out was important, because pinch-hitter Steve Sisco
singled, and reliever John Franco walked Rafael Furcal. With the
bases loaded, Franco threw three balls to Andruw Jones, and the
48,278 fans at Turner Field howled. But Jones took a strike and on
the next pitch popped to right to end the inning with the Mets
still ahead, 3-2.
</P>
<P>
   After the Mets scored twice in the eighth off Mike Remlinger,
Chipper Jones led off the Braves' eighth with a homer. With one out
and a runner on first, Valentine called for Benitez to relieve
Franco. Benitez walked two, loading the bases, but Keith Lockhart
popped up and Wally Joyner grounded out to keep the score 5-3.

EDWARD O. MILLER DIES AT 84; RECTOR BACKED LIBERAL CAUSES
</HEADLINE>
  By ERIC PACE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Rev. Edward O. Miller, an outspoken liberal Episcopal
minister who was the longtime rector of St. George's Episcopal
Church in Manhattan, died on Saturday in Bangor, Maine. He was 84
and lived in Castine, Maine.
</P>
<P>
   Miller was the rector of St. George's from 1946 to 1975. The
church is at 16th Street and Stuyvesant Square.
</P>
<P>
   For many years, he was also a member of the board of Union
Theological Seminary in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Under his leadership, St. George's became a center of liberal
activism and efforts to fight the social ills of the area it
served, but Miller also spent time in the national spotlight. In
1964, Miller testified during House Judiciary Committee hearings
about proposed constitutional amendments to permit prayers in
public schools.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking on behalf of the American Civil Liberties Union and as
a member of its national board, he strongly opposed the proposed
amendments, and said, ``In this opposition I am joined by the
presiding bishop of the Episcopal Church, Rt. Rev. Arthur
Lichtenberger, and the bishop of New York, Rt. Rev. Horace W.B.
Donegan.''
</P>
<P>
   In his testimony, Miller said, ``Basically the First Amendment
was adopted because the founding fathers believed that religion
flourishes best where it is the responsibility of the church and
the home, that religion thrives where it is voluntary and not
dependent on the coercive power of the state.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, in 1960, Miller defied the laws of his church by
refusing to read from the pulpit a pastoral letter issued by the
Episcopal House of Bishops. The letter affirmed that in essence the
Apostles' Creed and the Nicene Creed were as valid in the 20th
century as they were centuries earlier.
</P>
<P>
   In a sermon at St. George's, he described the document as full
of ``pious religious jargon,'' couched in ``archaic language'' and
``double talk.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a piece of sheer mediocrity in a world looking to the
church for a voice that is relevant and understanding,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In early 1965, the vestry members of St. George's resigned in a
conflict over the role that St. George's should play in meeting the
problems of the neighborhood. Previously, appeals by Miller that
the church take direct action against the causes of poverty were
not accepted with equanimity by all of the congregation.
</P>
<P>
   The resignation of the vestry, the board that manages the
financial affairs of the church, followed.
</P>
<P>
   After that, Miller vigorously supported a social-action program
to combat poverty in poor areas and to broaden the church's
membership.
</P>
<P>
   In the same period, he declared: ``It is clear that this
parish's role will be to continue to reach out to the major issues
of our day and experiment with fresh ideas in this fast-moving
world. We cannot survive as an isolated parish on Stuyvesant
Square, however vigorous our parish life may be. It will take faith
and risks to move ahead.''
</P>
<P>
   While he was its rector, St. George's was known for the quality
of its music at its regular services with large volunteer choirs
and on special occasions like an annual New Year's Eve celebration
featuring E. Power Biggs as guest organist. In 1964, the parish's
production of Benjamin Britten's ``Noye's Fludde'' was broadcast
nationally on CBS television.
</P>
<P>
   Edward Oehler Miller was born in St. Louis and graduated in 1937
from Harvard College and in 1941 from General Theological Seminary
in Manhattan. He was assistant to the rector of Christ Church in
Cincinnati before becoming the rector of St. George's.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife, Ann Lackman Miller; a daughter,
Helen H. Miller of Manhattan; three sons, Dr. David Miller and
Henry L. Miller, both of Manhattan, and the Rev. Edward O. Miller
of McLean, Va.; six grandchildren; and a sister, Martha M. Burt of
Marquette, Mich.

 NBC's RATINGS RISE AS GYMNASTS TUMBLE 
By JIM RUTENBERG   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NBC's ratings for the Sydney Summer Games, which in their first
four days drew the Olympics' smallest nighttime audience in U.S.
television history, improved on Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   But the Games' ratings still fell short of the NBC's original
expectations.
</P>
<P>
   The network's coverage of gymnastics and swimming on Tuesday
night drew a 17.8 prime-time rating _ meaning it was watched in an
average of 18.2 million households from 8 to 11 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   NBC said it was its most-watched Tuesday night since July 30,
1996, when it was covering the Summer Olympics in Atlanta. It
easily doubled the ratings of each of its broadcast network
competitors during prime time.
</P>
<P>
   But the network's entire night of Olympics coverage, from 7 p.m.
to 11:40 p.m., drew a smaller 15.5 rating. (Each rating point
represents slightly more than a million households.)
</P>
<P>
   Though Tuesday's was the best nightly rating so far for the 2000
Summer Games _ they had averaged a 14.3 rating through Monday night
_ it was still well below the average rating for the 1992 Summer
Olympics in Barcelona, Spain. Also shown on NBC, those Games
averaged a 17.5 rating.
</P>
<P>
   NBC had announced publicly that it expected do at least as well
this year. The ratings have been so far below original estimates
that NBC faces the likelihood of having to reimburse sponsors with
free advertising.
</P>
<P>
   But executives said Wednesday that the size of the audience on
Tuesday night _ the fifth night of the Games _ gave them hope that
the ratings would turn around.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're building momentum,'' said Cameron Blanchard, an NBC
Sports spokeswoman. ``There's clearly a big appetite for the
Olympics out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Executives offered no clear reason for the improvement in
ratings Tuesday night. They said they generally believed that they
were helped by the popularity of gymnastics, which Dick Ebersol,
the president of NBC Sports, called ``traditionally the
highest-rated events during the Olympics.''
</P>
<P>
   Executives said they hoped that more gymnastics events, and the
emergence of more compelling stories about athletes, would continue
to help raise the ratings.
</P>
<P>
   NBC has attributed many of their Olympics ratings problems to
the time difference between Australia and the United States. It is
forcing NBC to show events hours after the fact, when results have
been widely available not only on TV and radio newscasts, but also
on the Internet. The Games are also taking place later in the year
than usual, with school back in session and fewer people likely to
stay up late watching TV, they said.

CUBAN SURVIVORS OF CRASH ARE TAKEN TO U.S. HOSPITAL 
</HEADLINE>
   By RICK BRAGG    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI, Fla. _ Eight Cuban survivors of a plane crash in the Gulf
of Mexico were being taken on Wednesday to Key West for medical
evaluation, a move that is likely to allow them to remain in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Coast Guard officials decided late Wednesday evening to
take the eight Cubans to hospitals in Key West so they could be
treated for their injuries and evaluated by doctors, a spokesman
for the Immigration and Naturalization Service said.
</P>
<P>
   Once the eight Cubans set foot on U. S. soil, they can legally
apply for political asylum. A ninth survivor is already being
treated in Key West for head and neck injuries and is expected to
be moved shortly to be with friends and relatives in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   The decision to allow the Cubans off a Coast Guard vessel and
onto American soil was dictated by what Greg Gagne, a spokesman for
the immigration agency, called medical necessity.
</P>
<P>
   Ten people in all were inside the small crop-duster plane when
it took off from western Cuba on Tuesday and then crashed into the
Gulf of Mexico. The crew of the cargo ship Chios Dream pulled all
10 from the water, including one man with serious head injuries who
was flown to a hospital in Key West for treatment at a hospital and
one man who was killed in the crash.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier reports from American authorities had led many here in
Miami's Cuban-American community to believe that the eight
remaining passengers, none of them with life-threatening injuries,
would not be transferred to American soil anytime soon _ or at
best, that they would be taken to the U.S. Naval Base at Guantanamo
Bay, Cuba, where their requests for political asylum would be
heard. But Coast Guard officials apparently decided that all the
crash survivors needed medical attention.
</P>
<P>
   The decision at least appears to head off another confrontation
between the Clinton administration and Miami's Cuban Americans, who
had clashed over the Elian Gonzalez custody case.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the day, Reps. Lincoln Diaz-Balart and Ileana
Ros-Lehtinen, both Republicans from South Florida, and the
politically powerful Cuban American National Foundation sent
letters to the Clinton administration asking that the nine
survivors be granted political asylum.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly they will face persecution in Cuba for their
involvement in such a high-profile and risky attempt to flee the
island,'' wrote Diaz-Balart and Lehtinen, referring to early news
reports that the plane was hijacked from an airfield in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   The plane circled the Chios Dream and crashed about 50 miles
west of Cuba and 150 miles east of the Yucatan peninsula.
</P>
<P>
   The injured man, who identified himself to hospital officials as
Rodolfo Fuentes, 36, suffered a concussion, and was airlifted to a
Key West hospital. He was interviewed on Wednesday by the
authorities. Relatives in Miami said Mr. Fuentes was traveling with
his wife, Liliana Ponzoa, 36, and their son, Andy, 6.
</P>
<P>
   Coast Guard officials had not released the name of the dead man.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Bureau of Investigation said on Wednesday that the
Cuban plane did not appear to have been hijacked, as Cuban
officials said the pilot had reported, but the agency was
withholding a final determination until it questioned the other
survivors.
</P>
<P>
   Once the FBI determines whether the plane was hijacked or flown
from Cuba voluntarily, immigration officials will be able to decide
if the survivors qualify for asylum.
</P>
<P>
   A statement from the Cuban government, published on Wednesday in
the Communist Party daily Granma, said that the pilot, Lenin
Iglesias Hernandez, apparently first took off in the plane at 7:35
a.m. on Tuesday from a small airstrip for what appeared to be a
routine crop-dusting flight.
</P>
<P>
   The statement said he flew to another airport, picked up a group
of people waiting at the end of a runway, then took off again at
8:35 a.m.

MAN HELD IN TERROR PLOT HAD BEEN AN INFORMER IN A FEDERAL DRUG
INVESTIGATION
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mass., Wash.)  By BENJAMIN WEISER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ For about eight months, Abdel Ghani Meskini has sat
in a Manhattan jail, accused of having a role in a terrorist plot
to smuggle explosives into the United States before the millennium
celebrations.
</P>
<P>
   While his lawyer disputes that he had any role in a terrorist
plot, Meskini did make known Wednesday one surprising fact about
his resume: He was once a confidential informer for the U.S.
government.
</P>
<P>
   Meskini, a native of Algeria, testified in U.S. District Court
in Manhattan Wednesday that he had cooperated with the U.S. Customs
Service because he felt he had no choice: He was living in the
United States illegally and was told he would otherwise be
deported.
</P>
<P>
   Meskini said he had assisted the Customs Service for about two
months in 1995, and at one point made a secret tape recording of
others at the behest of a customs agent. The investigation involved
allegations that hashish was being smuggled into the United States
on Algerian tankers, federal officials said.
</P>
<P>
   A Customs Service spokesman, Dennis Murphy, said Wednesday: ``We
can confirm that Abdel Ghani Meskini received a total of $100
compensation from the U.S. Customs Service in 1995 and 1996 for
information he provided regarding illegal drug activities.''
</P>
<P>
   Murphy would not comment on Meskini's assertion that the customs
agent had essentially struck a deal with him not to pursue
deportation in return for his assistance. One government official
said the information and assistance from Meskini, who lived in
Boston at the time, led nowhere: No arrests or seizures of drugs
were made.
</P>
<P>
   Meskini's confidential role with the Customs Service was
revealed during cross-examination of Meskini by a federal
prosecutor, David N. Kelley. The testimony was given in a hearing
originally sought by Meskini and his lawyer to block prosecutors
from using a lengthy statement Meskini gave to the FBI after his
arrest last Dec. 30 at his Brooklyn apartment.
</P>
<P>
   Meskini, 32, has been indicted on charges he assisted in a
suspected terrorist plot that was interrupted last Dec. 14 when
another Algerian, Ahmed Ressam, was arrested as he tried to enter
Washington state from Canada. The authorities say Ressam was trying
to smuggle explosives and other bomb-making equipment into the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   A slip of paper found on Ressam during his arrest contained
Meskini's name and phone number, the authorities have said, leading
them to begin surveillance of him and ultimately to arrest him. The
intended target of the suspected plot has not been revealed, nor
its origins.
</P>
<P>
   Meskini and his lawyer, Roland Thau, have said in court papers
that Meskini was not properly informed of his rights against
self-incrimination and to counsel during the interrogation. They
contend Meskini spoke to the agents, in a session that lasted about
11 hours, only after they used threats and other forms of
psychological pressure on him.

   PASADENA, Calif. _ It was just what the Los Angeles Galaxy
wanted, a match filled with open lanes, free flanks and tons of
space.
</P>
<P>
   Tampa Bay's intimidating 6-foot-1 striker Mamadou ``Big Mama''
Diallo took advantage, showing why he's the MLS scoring champion.
But Tampa Bay's embarrassing breakdowns on defense were too much
for the Mutiny to overcome.
</P>
<P>
   With goals from Luis Hernandez, Mauricio Cienfuegos, Ezra
Hendrickson, Brian Kelly and Cobi Jones, the Galaxy eliminated the
Mutiny from the playoff with a 5-2 victory at the Rose Bowl on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   With the 2-0 series sweep, the Galaxy advances to the
best-of-three semifinal series against the winner of the Kansas
City-Colorado series. The Rapids and Wizards tied 0-0 earlier
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas City, which won the first match, leads that series on
points 4-1. For Colorado to beat the Wizards, it needs to win in
K.C., then win a 20-minute, sudden-death tiebreaker afterward.
</P>
<P>
   The five goals matches the season high for Los Angeles, which is
peaking at the perfect time.
</P>
<P>
   With a 2-1 lead and several missed chances in the first half,
the Galaxy buried the Mutiny early in the second half.
</P>
<P>
   Cienfuegos drove down the right side. He sent a pass behind
Kelly, but Hernandez followed in, slamming home his first playoff
goal. That gave the Galaxy a 3-1 lead in the 48th minute.
</P>
<P>
   Before the Mutiny could recharge, Hernandez returned the favor
to Cienfuegos, chipping a pass to open space. Cienfuegos gathered
it, dribbled away from Mutiny goalkeeper Scott Garlick, then placed
his shot to an open net in the 51st minute, ending what little hope
the Mutiny had left.
</P>
<P>
   Diallo scored his second goal in the 67th minute, but the Galaxy
settled and closed it out with a Jones goal.
</P>
<P>
   The flurry of goals started with Hendrickson. As he has done so
many times in the past, Hendrickson finished a beautiful
overlapping run up the middle. Cienfuegos spotted him, slipping a
nice pass through the seams that left Hendrickson one-on-one with
Garlick and defender Steve Trittschuh, who was rushing in.
</P>
<P>
   As Hendrickson entered the box, he held off Trittschuh, who fell
to the ground as the two were momentarily tangled. After
Hendrickson regained his footing, he beat Garlick to the far post
for a 1-0 lead in the 14th minute.
</P>
<P>
   With Tampa Bay trying to press forward, the Galaxy jumped to a
2-0 lead shortly after.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez flicked a no-look pass to Simon Elliott, who was
streaking in from the right side. With Garlick coming out to
challenge, Elliott slid the ball in front to Kelly, who scored from
two yards in the 19th minute.
</P>
<P>
   It was Kelly's first goal with the Galaxy since being traded
here from New York/New Jersey in May. Kelly started in place of
Olympian Peter Vagenas.
</P>
<P>
   Diallo notched his first goal of the playoffs, cutting the
Galaxy's lead in half.
</P>
<P>
   Diallo, who scored 26 goals during the regular season, received
the ball at the top of the penalty box and kept defender Paul
Caligiuri behind his left shoulder. Before any help could arrive,
Diallo threaded a tough angle shot inside the left netting in the
21st minute, ending Tampa's playoff scoring drought. It was Tampa's
first playoff goal since 1997 _ a span that covered 434 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Hartman, who left with a mild concussion in game one, preserved
the Galaxy's 2-1 lead with a one-handed tip save in the 30th
minute.
</P>
<P>
   The Galaxy could have taken advantage but missed two easy
chances near the end of the half.
</P>
<P>
   Cienfuegos received a give-and-go from Hernandez inside the box,
but Garlick gathered his weak shot easily.
</P>
<P>
   A minute later, Hernandez juked Trittschuh, but his left-footed
shot from eight-yards sailed wide.

GREENE'S BRAVADO MERELY AN ACT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia _ Australian reporters flocked to Darling
Harbour the other day to eyeball a rare bird. Their nervous titters
and quizzical expressions suggested they weren't sure what to make
of this species that yaks more than a parrot, laughs as m as a
kookaburra, runs more swiftly than a Western whipbird _ on legs as
powerful as an emu's _ and preens like an Adelaide rosella.
</P>
<P>
   Maurice Greene is the curio of Coogee, the exclusive coastal
enclave where the sprinter from Granada Hills is ensconced with
three fellow HSI athletes for the duration of the 27th Summer
Games.
</P>
<P>
   Greene, who holds the world record in the 100-meter dash, stands
in marked contrast to the local species of athlete, which is bred
not to be brash or bombastic. Indeed, Aussie sports stars are
conditioned from the cradle to speak of team and country and never,
ever of their accomplishments, no matter how remarkable they might
be.
</P>
<P>
   Here, self-promotion is next to barbarism. Aussies would sooner
work an 80-hour week than work a room.
</P>
<P>
   Greene, oblivious to the precepts of this place, strutted into
the interview room to polite applause and immediately metamorphose
alter ego, Mo Gold.
</P>
<P>
   ``C'mon,'' he bid the crowd, raising his arms like a preacher,
``Can't we get any louder than that?''
</P>
<P>
   OK, so Ian Thorpe, he is not.
</P>
<P>
   Greene's brashness isn't meant to offend. It's all an act _ a
jacket he puts on in public as Dean Martin did drunkenness and
Tommy Lasorda does sincerity.
</P>
<P>
   As his father, Ernest, who wore a bemused look during the press
conference, said, ``Maurice's brashness is just another way for him
to get his adrenaline flowing.''
</P>
<P>
   Trinidad's Ato Boldon, who trains alongside Greene at UCLA's
Drake Stadium and looms as one of his main rivals here, put it this
``Sprinters have the biggest mouths because they have the smallest
margin of error.''
</P>
<P>
   A telltale sign that Greene is not really as brassy as a wind
instrument is the fact fellow sprinter Jon Drummond and Boldon are
staying with him here. If his ego was really as big as the master
bedroom, would every night be a pajama party in Coogee?
</P>
<P>
   ``The outside perception has always been, 'How can you guys
possibly compete against each other and still remain friends?' ''
Boldon said. ``But amid all the cynicism, isn't that what the
Olympics are all about? Leaving competition on the playing field
and being friends when it's all over. Maurice and I have always
been able to separate who we are from what we do.''
</P>
<P>
   Hmmm. Makes you wonder if Greene is really as immature as he has
been portrayed.
</P>
<P>
   There can be no questioning his seasoning on the track. The
26-year-old, who migrated west from Kansas City, Kan., after
failing to make the 1996 U.S. Olympic team, is the only man ever to
hold the 50-, 60- and 100-meter records concurrently. He has broken
10 seconds in the 100 an astonishing 29 times, or 14 times more
than nine-time Olympic gold medalist Carl Lewis did.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis is Greene's AMP Tower: Wherever the brash one wanders
here, Lewis is his point of reference. Greene is driven to be just
like Lewis on the track and nothing like him off it.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis was much more introverted than Greene. He was widely
misunderstood by the public and the press. Greene, blessed with as
much charm as speed, goes out of his way to build a rapport with
everybody he meets.
</P>
<P>
   One day last week he and Drummond drove their rented yellow
Ferrari to a children's hospital in a Sydney suburb and conducted a
laughing session for 100 sick children inside.
</P>
<P>
   After he won the 100 meters at the U.S. Olympic Trials in
Sacramento in July, Greene hurdled a barricade next to the track
and began shaking fans' hands like a presidential candidate on the
campaign trail. Only it wasn't a photo op; the cameras were all
waiting for Greene in the nearby interview room. Greene simply
wanted to show that, fast-twitch muscles aside, he's just a regular
guy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want people to know that I'm approachable,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   On the track, of course, it's another story. U.S. sprinters have
won 15 of the 24 Olympic gold medals awarded in the 100, and Greene
appears poised to make it 16 of 25 on Saturday when the final is
run at Olympic Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of a training session last Thursday, he was clocked
in 9.78 seconds on his fifth 100-meters sprint of the afternoon. A
hand-held watch recorded the time, but no matter. A message was
sent:
</P>
<P>
   Greene's world record of 9.79 is good to go.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to win,'' Greene said. ``I came here to get a gold
medal in the 100 meters and that's what I plan on doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Affronted Australians might be mollified to know that for all
his bluster, Greene is old-school. He freely admits it doesn't
matter how many world records he sets or world championships he
wins. It doesn't matter how rich running makes him.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I go through my career not doing what I think I can do at
the Olympics,'' Greene said, ``my career will be worthless.''
</P>
<P>
   His value to track? It could turn out to be priceless.

MOVEMENT REPORTED IN MTA TALKS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ALEXA HAUSSLER and DOMINIC BERBEO 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; LOS ANGELES _ Trying to end a countywide transit strike,
negotiators for the MTA and the bus and rail operators unions met
all day and into the night IN Pasadena on Wednesday, with the first
hints of measurable progress reported.
</P>
<P>
   On the fifth day of the walkout, transit and union officials
both expressed hope that a deal was near, although there were
indications the strike could last at least until this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were tentative agreements reached on minor issues today,
but the major issues of wages and benefits are still on the
table,'' said Tom Webb, chief negotiator for the Metropolitan
Transportation Authority, as negotiations ended at 8:30 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   ``We understand their benefits consultant is not available until
Friday and we can't reach a deal without agreeing on benefits,''
Webb said.
</P>
<P>
   United Transportation Union Chairman James Williams said a
contract deal is closer than ever.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was more positive talk in the room today than we've had
in a long time,'' Williams said. ``We're very, very close.''
</P>
<P>
   He said talks could resume Thursday after an 11 a.m. union rally
downtown, but he added the talks might be postponed until Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Williams said a key sticking point was the issue of a
10-hour-a-day, four-day workweek proposed by the MTA to cut
overtime costs.
</P>
<P>
   With up to 21 people packed in a room at the Pasadena Hilton
hotel, the negotiations were the first since the strike began at
12:01 a.m. Saturday with bus drivers, mechanics and clerks walking
off the job, stranding some 450,000 weekday riders.
</P>
<P>
   MTA officials described the day's talks as encouraging.
</P>
<P>
   MTA spokesman Gary Wosk said the groups made progress on several
issues, and there was ``a lot of number crunching going on, on both
sides.''
</P>
<P>
   Bargaining broke down Friday night over issues including
overtime pay, cost-cutting measures and proposed autonomous transit
zones such as one proposed for the San Fernando Valley.
</P>
<P>
   The United Transportation Union, representing 4,300 bus and rail
operators, has rejected the MTA's proposals for controlling costs,
particularly overtime, saying they would take away protections
already in place for the rank and file.
</P>
<P>
   The UTU called the strike and members of the Amalgamated
Transportation Union, representing about 1,800 mechanics and
maintenance workers, and the Transportation Communications
International Union, representing about 630 clerical workers, also
walked out.
</P>
<P>
   The MTA operates bus, subway and above-ground rail lines
crisscrossing 1,400 square miles of Southern California.
</P>
<P>
   The transit agency said it faced a $438 million operating
deficit over the next 10 years unless it cuts costs or raises
fares. The agency wants $23 million in savings by cutting overtime
costs 15 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The MTA had offered 2.7 percent raises per year for three years,
but union representatives had asked for 4 percent increases each
year.
</P>
<P>
   The last transit strike in Los Angeles lasted nine days in 1994.
An earlier walkout in 1982 went for five days.
</P>
<P>
   With this week's strike stretching into its fifth day Wednesday,
the public turned increasingly to car pools, hitchhiking, walking
and other options for getting from home to work or school.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities reported large numbers of enterprising drivers
offering rides to strangers for a few dollars -- which is illegal
without a city license and insurance.
</P>
<P>
   Some gypsy cab drivers were cited Wednesday. Drivers caught
using their private cars as ``autos for hire'' risk having their
vehicles impounded and, if convicted, could receive a $1,000 fine
or a six-month jail term, Robert Johnson, senior investigator with
the city Department of Transportation, told The Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   ``We probably saw 100 to 150'' within an hour, he said. ``You
can go to just about any bus stop. It's so much that . . . we can't
curtail the problem.''

LETTER ASKS GOLDMAN SACHS TO ALLOW CORZINE DISCLOSURE
</HEADLINE>
  By DAVID M. HALBFINGER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON _ In the latest attempt by Republicans to force Jon
Corzine, the Democratic candidate for U.S. Senate, to release his
personal tax returns, a former federal judge called Wednesday on
Goldman Sachs Group, Corzine's former employer, to free him from a
confidentiality pact that Corzine says prevents him from doing so.
</P>
<P>
   Herbert J. Stern, who spent 13 years on the federal bench in
Newark after serving as U.S. attorney for New Jersey in the early
1970s, said in a letter to Henry M. Paulson Jr., who succeeded
Corzine as Goldman's chairman, that the ``extraordinary
circumstances'' of Corzine's candidacy justified such a move.
</P>
<P>
   ``I cannot know, of course, what there can be, if anything, in
this financial information which could possibly prejudice your
firm, which itself is publicly held,'' Stern wrote in a letter
dated Thursday and released at a news conference here Wednesday.
``I do know, however, that the lack of this information is
prejudicial to the informed judgment of the voting public.
</P>
<P>
   ``Weighing these interests in the balance,'' Stern concluded,
``I hope that you will agree that the public interest here is
paramount, and I therefore respectfully request that you permit the
people of New Jersey access to this information about a candidate
for the office of United States Senator.''
</P>
<P>
   Paulson was traveling Wednesday and could not be reached. A
spokesman for Goldman Sachs declined to respond on his behalf.
</P>
<P>
   The issue of his tax returns has been a particularly vexing one
for Corzine, who has been unable to make it go away despite months
of trying. When the subject came up in his Democratic primary
battle with former Gov. Jim Florio, Corzine said he asked
executives at Goldman to allow him to release his returns, but was
turned down.
</P>
<P>
   When he came under mounting pressure from Florio, Corzine asked
the firm to let him disclose a range of information _ from the
innocuous, like the total number of pages in his tax return, to a
list of the forms and schedules in his return, or a copy of his
return omitting any sensitive information. Again, the firm said no.
</P>
<P>
   And when reporters pressed Corzine to produce the
confidentiality agreement itself, to refute Florio's speculation
that he was using Goldman Sachs as a straw man, Corzine replied
that the firm had turned him down again. The secrecy agreement, he
said, even applied to itself.
</P>
<P>
   In the last few weeks, Corzine's Republican opponent, Rep. Bob
Franks, has revived Florio's line of attack and made it the focus
of his campaign. It has won him helpful headlines in the state's
newspapers at a time when Corzine is spending more each week for
television commercials than Franks has managed to raise since June.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Corzine caved in to pressure from Franks on a related
matter and published his charitable contributions for the last two
years. His records revealed that Corzine had given more than
$100,000 to groups whose leaders or sponsors later endorsed him,
and that Corzine had been less than completely candid when asked in
April whether he had made such donations.
</P>
<P>
   On the subject of releasing his tax returns, however, Corzine
has shown no sign of movement _ or perhaps more precisely, no sign
that he expects his former colleagues at Goldman Sachs might budge
from their earlier refusals.
</P>
<P>
   At his news conference Wednesday, Stern, the former judge, said
he had been asked by a lawyer for Franks to weigh in on the subject
but noted that although he is a Republican, he was not motivated by
partisan politics. As evidence of his independence, he said he had
been the Democratic appointee to a legislative commission that
investigated contracts for automobile inspection stations and the
E-ZPass system.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't doubt Mr. Corzine's word, when he says he has a
contract,'' Stern said. But he said Corzine should have realized in
advance that running for Senate today requires the fullest
financial disclosure. ``If I can't meet those conditions, then I
don't enter that arena,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A somewhat beleaguered Shea responded today that if Goldman
Sachs ``would grant Herb Stern's request, I'd be the happiest guy
in the world.''

NATHAN KROLL, 88, PRODUCER OF FILMS ON NOTED MUSICIANS 
</HEADLINE>
   By ANTHONY TOMMASINI   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Nathan Kroll, a film producer whose background as a
Juilliard-trained violinist informed his award-winning television
documentaries about the cellist Pablo Casals, the violinist Jascha
Heifetz and the tenor Luciano Pavarotti, among other musical
subjects, died last Thursday after a long illness. He was 88 and
lived in Tarrytown, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   Kroll's early years would seem to have presaged a traditional
performing career in classical music. Born on Nov. 5, 1911, in New
York City, he was inspired by the street musicians he heard from
his apartment window to ask his parents for a violin when he was
only 4.
</P>
<P>
   He had to content himself with a cardboard cutout toy violin
until his fifth birthday, when he was given the real thing, in
miniature. At 12 he made his debut at Aeolian Hall in New York. At
14 he began studying violin and composition at the Juilliard
Graduate School in Manhattan, the tuition-free branch of the two
institutions that would become the Juilliard School of Music in
1936. By the late 1920s he was touring under the management of
Arthur Judson.
</P>
<P>
   The Depression brought his fledgling career to a standstill.
Kroll began a new, more remunerative facet of his work, conducting
jazz orchestras and composing and conducting music for radio
broadcasts and films, with a break to serve in the military during
World War II.
</P>
<P>
   His first project as a film producer was a portrait of Martha
Graham at work, ``A Dancer's World,'' made for educational
television. His breakthrough came in 1960 with the ``Pablo Casals
Master Class'' series. Kroll edited down thousands of feet of film
showing Casals working with students from the University of
California at Berkeley into an hourlong introductory program and 24
half-hour follow-ups.
</P>
<P>
   Subsequent projects included television films of renowned
musicians offering master classes, including Heifetz, the guitarist
Andres Segovia and Pavarotti (``Pavarotti at Juilliard''), as well
as an eight-part series with the soprano Joan Sutherland, ``Who's
Afraid of Opera?''; ``Toscanini: A 100th Birthday Celebration'';
and ``Music at Marlboro.'' In 1964 he produced a feature-length
documentary film on a nonmusical subject: ``The Guns of August,''
based on Barbara W. Tuchman's history of the outbreak of World War
I.
</P>
<P>
   Kroll is survived by his wife, Claire Merrill Kroll; Stephen
Robert Kroll of Adamante, Vt., his son from an earlier marriage to
the concert agent Lucy Kroll; a stepdaughter, Lucy Merrill Cotter
of Sherman Oaks, Calif.; a stepson, Philip Merrill of Pasadena,
Calif.; and three step-grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   In 1989 Kroll donated tapes of his films and radio programs to
the Museum of Television and Radio in Manhattan. In a commemorative
booklet published by the museum at the time, the critic Howard
Kissel wrote that Kroll ``left a legacy of a different virtuosity
than what he envisioned as a violinist 60 years ago.''

UNSIGNED BLAKE GIVES UP CAPTAINCY

<TEXT>
<P>
   EL SEGUNDO, Calif. _ Rob Blake, the Los Angeles Kings' best
player and one of the NHL's top threedefensemen, has relinquished
his captaincy after negotiations broke downon a new contract.
</P>
<P>
   Blake, who replaced Wayne Gretzky as team captain before
the1996-97 season, is eligible for unrestricted free agency at the
end ofthe season. The two sides began negotiations during the
summer, but talks stalled and the Kings began to entertain thoughts
of trading the three-time All-Star as opposed to losing him without
compensation.
</P>
<P>
   Blake, 30, was seeking a three-year, $24-million extension. The
Kings were close at three years and $7.5 million, but with this
year's salary of $5.25 million, the total value was less than $7
million per season.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Los Angeles Kings' first priority is to keep Rob Blake in
a Kings uniform for the foreseeable future,'' general manager Dave
Taylor said on Wednesday. ``For this reason, we recently offered
Rob a very lucrative contract extension and he has elected to
refuse this offer.''
</P>
<P>
   Blake, who could not be reached for comment, recently said he
was aware St. Louis defenseman Chris Pronger, the league's reigning
MVP, was seeking a six-year deal worth $10 million per season.
</P>
<P>
   But with escalating salaries in the NHL, Blake was gambling on a
shorter deal with free agency still available at age 33.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings will not name a captain until the beginning of the
season, which opens Oct. 6 in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``In light of his refusal and the fact that Rob will become an
unrestricted free agent when his current contract expires on July
1, 2001, we must assess the long-term impact that Rob's decision to
reject the offer will have on the club,'' Taylor said. ``We will
look at all options and act in a manner that is in the club's best
long-term interests.''
</P>
<P>
   Blake has been a fixture in Los Angeles since he joined the
Kings at the end of the 1989-90 season after a college career at
Bowling Green. He lives year round in Manhattan Beach and married a
local woman twoyears ago. But when his last contract expired three
years ago, Blake also hinted during stalled negotiations it might
be time to move on.
</P>
<P>
   This recent gesture was far more than a hint.
</P>
<P>
   During training camp, the Kings have downplayed the Blake
contract situation. Taylor said the club's top priority was getting
first-line center and restricted-free-agent Jozef Stumpel into camp
with a new contract.
</P>
<P>
   Stumpel is playing in his native Slovakia. If he does not
agreeto terms by the opening night of the season, there is a good
chance he will not play for the Kings this year. If he continues to
play overseas after the NHL season begins Oct. 6, Stumpel would
have to clear waivers to return to the club.
</P>
<P>
   As negotiations between the Kings and Blake's agent Ron Salcer
failed to reach an agreement, trade rumors throughout the league
began tocirculate. In one three-way scenario, Blake would go to
Toronto, 90 minutes from Simcoe, Ont., where he grew up and
Ottawa's disgruntled center Alexei Yashin would join the Kings.
</P>
<P>
   Yashin refused to play for the Senators last season because they
would not renegotiate the final year ($3.6 million) of his
contract. Yashin is back with the Senators, but the club is
listening to offers because he will be an unrestricted free agent
at the end of the season.

FAVORITE FALLS TO HYMAN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia _ Butterfly specialist Misty Hyman was Tom
Candiotti stripped of his knuckleball, Mark McGwire stripped of the
home run, John Daly stripped of his driver.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, the underwater fishkick that had propelled her,
dolphin-like, into world prominence was outlawed by swimming's
international governing body.
</P>
<P>
   For the next year, Hyman was adrift. The Stanford senior had
pioneered the technique in which she pushed off the wall on her
side and did a dolphin kick underwater for 30 meters before taking
her first armstroke. She had won seven national titles using the
technique and wasn't sure if she could win another one without it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll be honest with you,'' she said Wednesday. ``It was a huge
challenge. I really felt like that fishkick was what brought me to
this level. I wasn't sure I would continue to be at the elite level
without it.''
</P>
<P>
   She doesn't have to wonder _ or worry _ anymore. With apologies
to Pieter van den Hoogenband, Hyman pulled off the upset of the
Olympic swimming competition in the 200-meter butterfly on
Wednesday, defeating hometown favorite Susie O'Neill, the defending
Olympic champion and reigning (but just barely) world-record
holder.
</P>
<P>
   It was easily the biggest upset this side of The Netherlands
baseball team; O'Neill had not been defeated in the event in six
years. Hyman, 21, was timed in 2 minutes, 5.88 seconds, trimming
two seconds off the personal best she posted in the semifinals and
tearing the collective tongue right out of the crowd of 17,500 at
the International Aquatic Centre.
</P>
<P>
   She also shaved 0.08 second off Mary T. Meagher's American
record, which had stood as the world record for 19 years until
O'Neill clocked a 2:05.81 during May in the Olympic pool.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Hyman, Inge de Bruijn got a world record Wednesday, but
the gold medal will have to wait; she lowered her own global mark
in the semifinals of the 100 freestyle with a 53.77 clocking. Her
countryman, van den Hoogenband, who had upset Ian Thorpe in the 200
freestyle earlier in the week, denied Russia's Alex Popov his third
consecutive Olympic gold medal in the 100 freestyle by out-touching
the decorated veteran 48.30 to 48.69 (Aussie Michael Klim, who set
the world record last week, was fourth.)
</P>
<P>
   Domenico Fioravanti of Italy won the 200-meter breaststroke with
the third-fastest time in history (2:10.87) and the U.S. women
prevailed in the 800 freestyle relay. Hyman's swim, however, was
the highlight during the fifth of eight days of competition.
</P>
<P>
   Seeded fourth in the final, she set a blistering pace. Hyman was
the only finalist to post a split less than 60 seconds. When she
touched 0.6 second ahead of O'Neill at the 150 and turned for home,
the U.S. team held its collective breath.
</P>
<P>
   Hyman has a history of fading in the final 50 meters, and
O'Neill is known for her strength down the stretch.
</P>
<P>
   ``So many times I have struggled coming home on the last lap,''
Hyman said. ``I pushed off that wall tonight and I said, `I can do
this. I can finish this.' ''
</P>
<P>
   O'Neill gained a little ground, but not enough to spoil Hyman's
waking dream. Upon touching the wall, she turned around and stared
at the scoreboard. As it sunk in that she had won, she began
mouthing ``Oh my God.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. teammate Kaitlin Sandeno, who finished sixth with a
personal best of 2:08.81, hurried over to Hyman's lane and
swallowed her in a hug. Said Sandeno later, ``This just shows that
people you don't think can be beat at this meet can be beat.''
</P>
<P>
   After receiving her gold medal, Hyman retired to the interview
room. There she gave a speech worthy of an Oscar winner, thanking
everyone from her parents to her Pilates instructor and
chiropractor (welcome to swimming in the new millenium).
</P>
<P>
   If she was more bubbly than champagne, there was a reason. Four
months ago, Hyman's swimming was so flat she contemplated
retirement. ``I was questioning myself and my own worth as a
swimmer,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Quick, her coach at Stanford, and fellow swimmers and
Cardinal support staff talked her out of it. ``There were so many
people who just believed in me so much,'' Hyman said, ``and
wouldn't let me throw in the towel.''
</P>
<P>
   It just goes to show, it takes a village sometimes to raise the
U.S. flag to the rafters.

KARROS STUNS DIAMONDBACKS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ If only the Los Angeles Dodgers had fourth and
fifth starter this season, then maybe what Kevin Brown, Chan Ho
Park and Darren Dreifort did to the Arizona Diamondbacks would have
more meaning than just show.
</P>
<P>
   If only the Dodgers had a fourth and fifth starter, maybe Dodger
Stadium would have been sold out rather than hosting an announced
crowd of 31,631.
</P>
<P>
   If, if, if. . . That's what becomes when a season full of
expectations turns into disappointment and distress.
</P>
<P>
   Dreifort followed the lead of the first two starters by throwing
7 shutout innings of his own and Eric Karors led of the bottom of
the ninth with a homer as the Dodgers beat the Diamondbacks 1-0
Wednesday. In sweeping the three-game series from Arizona, the
Dodgers allowed one run.
</P>
<P>
   Karros' homer was his first in 29 games, his longest drought
since 1994. It was his 31st of the season and came off Arizona
reliever Byung-Hyun Kim. It also was the 242nd of his career, tying
him with Roy Campanella for third on the Dodgers' (Brooklyn and
L.A.) career list.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers' sixth straight win, matching a season high, vaulted
them into second place in the National League West for the first
time since June 8. The Dodgers (81-72) also tied a season high by
going nine games over .500.
</P>
<P>
   However, it would still take a miracle, if not more, to get the
Dodgers into the playoff picture. With nine games left they trail
the Mets by 5 games in the wildcard.In the three games against the
Diamondbacks, Brown, Park and Dreifort didn't allow a run in 22
innings. That trio is 39-24 while the fourthand fifth starters are
10-25, and that includes three wins in the last nine days.
</P>
<P>
   Matt Herges pitched a scoreless ninth inning to improve to 11-3,
including 11-0 in relief.
</P>
<P>
   With Brown and Park already mastering the Diamondbacks, Dreifort
took his turn by matching Arizona lefty Randy Johnson, who allowed
five hits and struck out eight in seven shutout innings. Dreifort
allowed five runs, walked two and struck out eight.
</P>
<P>
   Scoring chances were few for both sides, but the Dodgers had an
early chance to get to Johnson when Mark Grudzielanek, playing
shortstop for the first time this season, tripled into the left
field corner with one out. But Shawn Green, 3 for 12 lifetime
against Johnson coming in, struck out. Karros also struck out to
end the inning.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers also had first and second and none out in the
fourth, but Karros struck out and Grudzielanek was thrown out
trying to steal third. Bruce Aven eventually grounded out to end
the inning.
</P>
<P>
   Dreifort, making his career-high 30th start, breezed through
most of the way, retiring 14 straight Diamondbacks at one point.
But Kelly Stinnett ended that string with an infield single with
one out in the eighth inning. Pinch-runner Hanley Frias was thrown
out trying to steal, but pinch-hitter Rob Ryan walked, Tony Womack
singled and Dreifort walked Craig Counsell to load the bases.
</P>
<P>
   But Terry Adams relieved and struck out Luis Gonzalez to end the
inning.

PETER PINCHBECK, 69; ABSTRACT PAINTER AND ART TEACHER 
</HEADLINE>
   By ROBERTA SMITH   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ RPeter Pinchbeck, an English-born painter who worked
in an Abstract Expressionist vein, was found dead in his Manhatten
loft on Sept. 10. He was 69.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was cardiovascular hypertensive disease, his family
said. He was found by friends after they became concerned when he
failed to appear for the first day of classes at Bprough of
Manhattan Community College, where he had taught art history,
painting and composition for nearly 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   Pinchbeck was a tall, courteous man who sprinkled his writings
on painting with quotes from Jacques Derrida and Stephen Hawking.
Except for a brief phase of streamlining in the mid-1960s, when he
was included in ``Primary Structures,'' an early exhibition of
Minimal Art at the Jewish Museum, he spent most of his career
exploring the clearly hand-wrought surfaces and figure-ground
relationships introduced by the Abstract Expressionists. At the
same time, his frequently planar compositions reflected the
influence of the Russian Constructivists.
</P>
<P>
   He said he felt that gestural abstract painting, with its
self-evident brushwork, could create an experience of time and
space that differed from that of reality, science and most other
kinds of painting.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1970s and 80s his canvases tended to be dominated by
burly, squarish shapes that sometimes seemed to close off space or
plummet through it. In the 1990's his colors heated up and his
shapes became more playful, eventually evolving into buoyant
barbell volumes that appeared, paradoxically, to be continuous with
the light-filled space they inhabited.
</P>
<P>
   Pinchbeck was born in 1931 in London and studied at the
Twickenham College of Art and the Polytechnic Art School, both in
London. Intrigued by the Abstract Expressionists, he moved to New
York in 1961, and his work began appearing in gallery group shows.
He had his first solo show at the Paley &AMP; Lowe Gallery in the SoHo
section of Manhatten in 1970; his most recent one at the June Kelly
Gallery in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife, the writer Joyce Johnson of
Manhattan, from whom he had been separated since the early 1970s;
and their son, Daniel, a writer and co-editor of Open City, an art
and literature magazine, also of Manhattan.

KERT LUNDELL, 64, BROADWAY SET DESIGNER 
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Kert Lundell, a set designer for more than 75
Broadway and Off Broadway productions who won three Drama Desk
Awards, died on Sept. 11. He was 64 and lived in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was lung cancer, said his wife, Bretta.
</P>
<P>
   Lundell, whose career spanned four decades, created the set
design for Frank Gilroy's ``Contact with the Enemy,'' about two
World War II veterans who meet by chance at the Holocaust Museum in
Washington, staged at the Ensemble Studio Theater late last year.
</P>
<P>
   His design was nominated for a Drama Desk Award and was praised
in the theater industry journal Back Stage, which said it ``has
brilliantly solved the cinematic nature of the play, taking us
swiftly to various parts of the museum and finally to a bar in the
neighborhood.''
</P>
<P>
   Lundell also designed sets for plays by Neil Simon, Arthur Kopit
and Gower Champion.
</P>
<P>
   He taught briefly at Smith College and was a trustee of the
Ensemble Theater.
</P>
<P>
   Lundell was born in Malmo, Sweden. When he was 15, he and his
family moved to the United States and settled in Laguna Beach,
Calif. He graduated from the Goodman Theater School in Chicago and
studied at the Yale School of Drama from 1959 to 1961. An early
marriage ended in divorce.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his wife, he is survived by a son, Erik, and a
daughter, Kate, both of Manhattan.

NEW YORK CITY MAYOR RENEWS CALL FOR ARENA, WITH GOVERNOR'S BACKING
</HEADLINE>
  By ELISABETH BUMILLER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Mayor Rudolph Giuliani said Wednesday that he wanted
to build a domed indoor-outdoor arena on the West Side of Manhattan
that would seat up to 100,000 people for major concerts,
conventions and sports events. His plans were supported for the
first time by Gov. George Pataki, who controls the agency that owns
the land.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're interested in moving forward with this,'' said Zenia
Mucha, a senior adviser to Pataki, who said the governor wanted the
plans to include the expansion of the Jacob Javits Convention
Center.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani left open the possibility Wednesday that the arena
could be used by the Jets, the New York Yankees, the New York Mets
or the Olympics in 2012. But he said he wanted to build the arena,
on a site from 30th to 34th Street on the West Side, regardless of
whether he had commitments from the International Olympic Committee
or the football and baseball teams.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm open to all ideas, not closed to any,'' Giuliani said
during a news conference in the City Hall Blue Room. ``And I'm
willing to put together whatever group will get me that large,
domed, indoor arena. If that includes getting the Jets back, that
would be wonderful. If it doesn't, and we still build the stadium,
we can justify it. If it solves the Yankee problem or the Met
problem or some other, those are all tangental to it. The main
thing is getting the domed indoor arena.''
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani has wanted to build a stadium on the West Side for
years and is negotiating now with Jets officials. But his remarks
Wednesday were quickly taken as a positive development by other
parties who want space on the Hudson River.
</P>
<P>
   Members of NYC 2012, the local Olympic committee that has been
working with the Jets on a potential West Side stadium that could
be used for football and the Olympics, said the mayor's comments
were consistent with their plans. The mayor proposed such a stadium
in his State of the City speech in January. That same month Robert
Wood Johnson IV bought the Jets and said he was looking for a new
home for the football team.
</P>
<P>
   But representatives of the Yankees embraced the mayor's words
Wednesday as a revival of a proposed $1 billion West Side stadium
for the Yankees, an idea vigorously promoted by the mayor in 1996
but beaten down by opposition from city residents, politicians and
most community leaders on the West Side.
</P>
<P>
   ``It certainly leaves open an option of a baseball stadium,''
said Howard Rubenstein, a spokesman for the Yankees and an owner of
the team. ``Everything is possible because it's an excellent
location.'' Although George Steinbrenner, the chief owner of the
Yankees, has been publicly quiet on the subject in recent months,
local real estate and planning officials say that he has complained
that a West Side stadium should be his, not Johnson's.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki had long been skeptical of a West Side stadium for the
Yankees, and has said they should remain in the Bronx. It was
unclear why Giuliani suddenly left a door open for the Yankees
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani said he wanted the arena to have a retractable roof.
``It would be open so that you could play football there on the
good days,'' Giuliani said. ``You could close it, not only for
football, but for a second purpose, that would have tremendous
economic benefit for the city.'' He added that the city was losing
``hundreds of millions if not billions of dollars'' because it
lacked a big indoor stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we need is a place where 50,000 to 100,000 people can sit
down indoors and watch something, a concert, a convention, a
show,'' Giuliani said, noting that Madison Square Garden holds only
20,000 people. He added that a large indoor arena would allow the
city to compete for events like the Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani admitted that his plans were still ``all in the
discussion and proposal stage'' but said he was not going to back
down under what would almost certainly be enormous neighborhood
opposition. ``You've got to keep challenging all the people that
sit there saying, `Ah, can't be done, you can't do it, you
shouldn't do it,''' he said. ``Those are the people that were
killing the city.''

COLD SPELL FOR DUCKS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By FRANK WELCH  
 c.2000 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ The exhibition season is all about ironing out
the bugs. National Hockey League teams, using one professional
sport as an example, go to great lengths to avoid catching new
viruses when preparing for the regular season.
</P>
<P>
   It seems the Mighty Ducks collectively found themselves with a
rather nasty cold entering Wednesday's game against the expansion
Minnesota Wild. . . . A team-consuming cold spell when it came to
scoring goals.
</P>
<P>
   Anaheim went 140 minutes, 20 seconds (just over seven periods)
without scoring before finally finding the back of the net during a
3-0 victory over the Wild before an announced crowd of 9,77 at The
Pond.
</P>
<P>
   Ducks' left wing Mike Leclerc, parked unchecked in front of the
net, popped home a rebound off of a backhand shot from right wing
Ladislav Kohn with 48 seconds left in the first period to end the
dry spell.
</P>
<P>
   Leclerc added his second goal when he redirected a shot from
defenseman Patrick Traverse with seven minutes gone in the third
period. Again, Leclerc found skating room in front of the net.
</P>
<P>
   Anaheim, which lost its previous three preseason games, scored
just one other goal prior to Leclerc's first tally - a third period
goal from defenseman Chris O'Sullivan in San Jose last Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   While the scoreless streak found its cure in Leclerc, another
streak continues to mount. Yes, it's the preseason, so the concern
level among the Ducks coaching staff is minimal. After all, it is
still September.
</P>
<P>
   Anaheim ran its consecutive power-less streak to 27 straight as
it failed to convert on four more power-play opportunities through
two periods against Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   The top power-play unit did finally break through when Steve
Rucchin made it 3-0 when he converted a rebound from a shot from
Teemu Selanne. McInnis got the assist, however, the even strength
goal came three seconds after a Minnesota penalty expired.
</P>
<P>
   The Ducks' power-play, which was brutal for much of the early
portion of last season, clearly is in a state of transition with
the retirement of defenseman and point trigger man Fredrik
Olausson.
</P>
<P>
   Anaheim coach Craig Hartsburg is giving veteran left wing Marty
McInnis a chance to win the job. Hartsburg also said he may look at
Matt Cullen, Jonas Ronnqvist, German Titov, and Paul Kariya at the
point. Kariya played plenty on the point two years ago, when the
Ducks were tops in the NHL on the power-play.
</P>
<P>
   __ Six familar faces were spotted on the Wild roster. Defenseman
Sean O'Donnell and left wing Kai Nurminen played with the Kings
last year, while right wing Jeff Nielsen and defenseman Ladislav
Benysek are former Mighty Ducks. All three were taken in
Minnesota's expansion draft this past summer.
</P>
<P>
   O'Donnell, never much of a scoring threat during his years in
Los Angeles, had two assists during Minnesota's 3-3 tie on Tuesday
against San Jose. That was the club's first-ever game and it was
played at the Rose Garden in Potland.
</P>
<P>
   Former Anaheim defenseman J.J. Daigneault stayed behind as the
Wild took a look at younger prospects. Former King enforcer Steve
McKenna has had back spasms and he also did not dress for the game.
</P>
<P>
   __ Did they miss the NHL during the past seven years in
Minnesota? You be the judge.
</P>
<P>
   The Wild has sold 15,400 season tickets and the home opener on
Oct. 11, against the Philadelphia Flyers sold out in two minutes
last Saturday when individual tickets went on sale. The team also
sold 40,00 single game tickets last weekend.

   EL SEGUNDO, Calif. _ A long, angst-filled summer, riddled with
broken promises and failed deals, at last ended happily for the Los
Angeles Lakers on Wednesday as two months of grinding negotiations
finally coalesced into one, massive, historic trade that solved all
their problems simultaneously _ and relocated a Hall of Famer to
boot.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers finally unloaded grumpy Glen Rice, sending him to the
New York Knicks in a long-anticipated swap that took four teams to
Knicks in turn have traded their resident legend, Patrick Ewing, to
Seattle, with the Sonics sending Horace Grant to the Lakers.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle will also send three role players to the Lakers: Greg
Foster, who fills a glaring need at backup center, plus veteran
sharp Person and journeyman guard Emanual Davis to fill out the
bench.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm relieved,'' Lakers general manager Mitch Kupchak said in a
conference call Wednesday evening. ``And I know our coaching staff
is relieved, as well. I brought them kind of up and down the whole
summer, four or five times, and I did the same thing with our
owner, just keeping people in the loop. It builds, and then when it
falls apart, there's a lot of frustration, which I know they shared
with me. . . .
</P>
<P>
   ``To get something done that helps our team in several areas,
it's a relief. And I'm probably most happy for our coaches, who
have wondered for 2 months where they'd be a week from now.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a deal long in the making but left for dead after several
previous attempts fell apart. The Phoenix Suns helped pulled it
from the ashes, sources said.
</P>
<P>
   By agreeing to send Luc Longley to the Knicks (in exchange for
Chris Dudley), the Suns gave the Knicks a viable replacement for
Ewing. New York shot down earlier deals that would have netted them
only As an added bonus, the Lakers will unload seldom-used Travis
Knight, who takes the last four years and $15 million of his
contract to New York. The Knicks will also receive
lottery-protected first-round 20 And the Lakers _ stymied in
countless attempts to land a starting power forward _ get Grant, a
6-10 veteran who won three champio Having replaced A.C. Green and
Rice with Grant and Isaiah Rider, the Lakers now boast a lineup
superior to the one that captured the NBA championship last season:
Shaquille O'Neal at center, Grant at power forward, Kobe Bryant at
small forward and a backcourt of Ron Harper and Rider.
</P>
<P>
   The 35-year-old Grant should mesh perfectly with the Lakers. He
played five seasons under Jackson with the Bulls and is proficient
in the triangle offense, a prolific rebounder and defensive-minded.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's apparent we need help in the frontcourt, and I
don't think there's a better player out there to help us than
Horace Grant,'' Kupchak said. ``He's a true power forward, he's
experienced, experienced with Phil, he knows how to win. And he's
won.''
</P>
<P>
   Grant also played two seasons alongside O'Neal with the Orlando
Magic. The two are good friends, and O'Neal has openly lobbied
management to acquire Grant.
</P>
<P>
   Grant has averaged 12.1 points and 8.6 rebounds in a 13-year
career. He averaged 8.1 points and 7.8 rebounds last season, while
often playing out of position at center.
</P>
<P>
   The budget-minded Lakers also like Grant's contract: he's due a
manageable $5.95 million and is a free agent at the end of the
season, though Kupchak said he'd like to see Grant play ``two or
three years'' here.
</P>
<P>
   That the Lakers pulled off a deal at all, much less one that
filled so many needs, is a wonder, and comes just 13 days before
they open training camp.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last two months, they failed in attempts to deal Rice
for, among others, Christian Laettner, Toni Kukoc, Anthony Mason
and P.J. Brown. They tried to sign free agents Kendall Gill and
John Amaechi but were turned down by both.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, they faced the prospect of having Rice walk away as a
free agent _ an embarrassing prospect given that they traded
All-Star Eddie Jones and Elden Campbell to get Rice in a
controversial deal last year.
</P>
<P>
   Within the last week, Rice threatened to sign a one-year deal
with the Chicago Bulls and leave the Lakers empty-handed. But at
age 33, he was determined to get a long-term contract, and for that
he needed the Lakers to orchestrate a sign-and-trade deal. The
Lakers never ceased efforts to find Rice a new home, provided they
could obtain a starter in return.
</P>
<P>
   The deal finally came together Wednesday afternoon, just as the
Bulls were preparing to announce they had signed Rice. In a mildly
humorous subplot, the Bulls, realizing they had been used as
leverage, instead issued a terse statement saying they were no
longer interested in Rice.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers will sign Rice to a multi-year deal, starting in the
$8 million range, then trade him to New York.
</P>
<P>
   Kupchak, who made his first trade as the Lakers' new head of
operations, said he never lost faith a deal would get done, and he
was ``surprised to read'' premature reports that had Rice signing
with the Bulls.
</P>
<P>
   ``Quite frankly, I had a better degree of comfort in the last
day or two, despite what you think could have happened today (with
the Bulls),'' he said. ``I just felt this would work. It was a good
thing for Glen and the teams involved seemed committed for several
days now.''
</P>
<P>
   Rice never fit with Jackson's system, or as a third option, and
played the two least productive seasons of his career in L.A. Rice
was never going to return here, but finding a way to obtain value
for him ``consumed our office'' all offseason, Kupchak said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's no secret that the Glen Rice question has loomed over our
heads now since the season ended, and even prior to that,'' Kupchak
said. ``It's just an issue we hoped would have been a lot
smoother.''
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers now have 18 players under contract _ including Derek
Fisher, who is out for at least six months _ and still hope to
re-sign Brian Shaw. Otherwise, they are done adding players.
</P>
<P>
   The 12-player trade ties an NBA record for most players in one
swap.
</P>
<P>
   New York also will receive Vladimir Stepania, Lazaro Borrell,
Vernon Maxwell and two second-round picks from Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   For the Knicks, the trade paves the way for a second deal. With
Ewing's $14 million salary off the books, New York plans to package
either Latrell Sprewell or Allan Houston with Marcus Camby in a
trade for the Hawks' Dikembe Mutombo, sources said.
</P>
<P>
   In Ewing, the Sonics finally have a formidable, if aging, post
player to complement All-NBA guard Gary Payton.
</P>
<P>
   The Suns get rid of Longley's bloated contract, which had four
years and $24 million remaining. Phoenix also receives a
lottery-protected 2001 first-round pick from the Knicks and an
undisclosed sum of cash.

NBC RATINGS SUFFER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TOM HOFFARTH  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR; Continuing on a torrid pace to become the worst-rated Summer
Olympics of all time, NBC's all-taped coverage from Sydney suffered
another indignity Wednesday _ it was bested in key demographics by
ABC's ``Monday Night Football'' game.
</P>
<P>
   According to Nielsen's preliminary overnight ratings that were
sifted through by ABC's press department, the Redskins-Cowboys
contest (8.7) wasn't close to besting the Monday-night Olympic
prime-time coverage (13.8), but it actually had a better share (24
to 23). Meaning of those TV sets turned on, a slightly better
percentage tuned to football rather than the Games.
</P>
<P>
   Further, ``MNF'' was more than 50 percent better than the
Olympics among the commercially coveted men-aged-25-to-54 group
(13.0 rating/32 share vs. 8.6/22). It had even larger advantages
among men aged 18- 5.4/17), men aged 18-to-49 (11.9/32 vs. 7.2/20)
and adults aged 18-to-34 (8.0/24 vs. 6.7/21).
</P>
<P>
   NBC's Tuesday-night prime-time rating, meanwhile, came through
with the highest mark to date _ 15.5 rating and 26 share _ boosted
gymnastics. When averaged in with the other four days of
competition coverage, it comes out to a 14.6 rating and 25 share.
</P>
<P>
   That figure is 36 percent lower than what NBC had after five
days in Atlanta in 1996 (22.9/43), 20 percent off Barcelona in 1992
(18.2/34) and 12 percent off Seoul in 1988 (16.5/30). The latter
number comparing Sydney to Seoul is the most fair comparison when
facoring in th between there and the U.S. viewers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We expect (ratings) to continue to build with the events over
the next couple of days,'' NBC Sports chairman Dick Ebersol said in
a statement, noting that the upcoming men's and women's all-around
gymnastics competition is traditionally the best-rated events
during the Games.

trepidation, having rounded one of the last turns on its circuitous
route to the World Trade Organization. Many Chinese worry that the

   KY-DUMP-CLEANUP (McKee, Ky) _ Forty counties of eastern Kentucky
are stirring a fresh political cause by rooting out the casual
hillside garbage dumps and creek-born sewage that has long fed the
stereotype of backwoods fecklessness in Appalachia. The region,
intent on building a tourist- and retiree-friendly image, has
prompted the state to pass tough new laws including one that denies
electricity hookups to any new home that relies on old style
``straight pipe'' sanitation _ straight to the Great Outdoors. By
Francis X. Clines.

   SCI-QUAKE-RISK (Undated) _ While California stands to lose the

Seattle, Portland, New York, Salt Lake City and St. Louis, are also
at risk of heavy damage, the Federal Emergency Management Agency
reported Wednesday in its first national study of earthquake risk.

   CAMPAIGN-MILITARY _ Al Gore enlisted in the Army and went to
Vietnam. George W. Bush joined the Texas National Guard and did
not. But for many in uniform, especially officers, that makes

domestic critics and business leaders who said their land might be

participate in the Continent's greatest financial revolution. Now,

politicians of the day often tried to restrain them in the name of
preventing youth from going to hell in a handbasket. The debate

   NY-VIDEO-MARKET (New York) _ Organized by an alliance of movie
makers and distributors called the Independent Feature Project, the
video market now in full swing here gathers directors, producers,
distibutors, agents, broadcasters, Web site operators and all
manner of provocateurs on the independent movie scene to view new
work and make connections that will help filmmakers find
development money and outlets for their work. Of the 400 projects

   PEKING-OPERA (Beijing) _ With its complex stories sung in high
whiny voices, crashing cymbals and highly stylized movements,
Peking Opera is not an easy art form for the uninitiated to love.
But not so long ago every city in China was obliged to have an
opera troupe, if only as a symbol of local pride. Today, the number
of troupes is less than 60 nationwide, and some provinces don't
have any. China's younger generation is far more attuned to the NBA

SPARRING BEGINS ON OVERSIGHT OF NEW YORK CITY AIDS UNIT
</HEADLINE>
  By NINA BERNSTEIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ When the city, with no warning, canceled the food
stamps of a 39-year-old Bronx father with AIDS in the summer, a
lawyer tried two techniques to get the benefits restored: She wrote
a letter to a top official at the Division of AIDS Services and
Income Support, and she made a legal demand for a hearing on behalf
of the man and his teen-age son.
</P>
<P>
   The letter went unanswered, the lawyer, Cynthia Knox, recalled
Wednesday, and by the time of the scheduled hearing date, weeks
later, the man had died of his disease, having had to fight in his
final days for something as basic as food.
</P>
<P>
   This week, a federal judge ruled that the city ``chronically and
systematically'' delayed and terminated benefits to thousands of
people with AIDS, and he opened a new avenue of redress, placing
the city's AIDS agency under federal authority for three years.
</P>
<P>
   No one knows exactly how the federal monitoring will work. The
city, which is appealing the ruling, contends that the order is
``vague'' and ``confusing'' about the role of the federal
magistrate judge appointed to oversee the city agency.
</P>
<P>
   But advocates like Knox, who testified during the bench trial in
the class-action lawsuit _ Henrietta D. v. Giuliani _ say that
federal oversight will bring swifter remedies to more AIDS clients,
in part because the city will face stiff penalties if its agency
remains unresponsive. And lawyers in other recent class-action
lawsuits against the city's welfare operation say that monitoring
by a federal court has sometimes been helpful in forcing the city
to meet its legal obligations.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Hess, the city's corporation counsel, has criticized the
decision, issued Tuesday by Judge Sterling Johnson Jr. of U.S.
District Court in Brooklyn. ``New York City provides more money and
more services for AIDS-related people than any other city in the
nation,'' Hess said.
</P>
<P>
   Leonard Koerner, the chief of appeals for the city's legal
department, said that a conference would be needed ``to determine
how the magistrate views her obligations under the opinion.'' He
added, ``We believe that the opinion is vague as to the obligations
that both parties have in front of the magistrate.''
</P>
<P>
   Cheryl L. Pollack, the federal magistrate judge appointed by
Johnson to oversee the city agency, declined through her law clerk
to say how she planned to handle the task. But lawyers with
experience in such cases said that typically a court-appointed
overseer was instrumental in hammering out an agreement on what
steps the city would take to fix the systemic problems, and how to
verify that the rules were being followed by city caseworkers.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not rocket science,'' said Marc Cohan, director of
litigation for the Welfare Law Center, which has been involved in
three class-action lawsuits that won the appointment of special
masters or other judicial oversight. ``What it requires is for the
city to roll up its sleeves, give instructions to workers, put
quality control and accountability in place: something the city is
loath to do, particularly because it has a philosophy of deterrence
and denial of benefits.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The judge,'' Cohan added, ``was basically saying the law
requires you to take certain steps, but you don't have procedures
in place to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson's decision is the latest in a series of cases in which
lawyers for the poor have successfully argued in court that the
Giuliani administration illegally denied benefits to those entitled
to receive them. In Reynolds v. Giuliani, for example, a federal
judge who found the city had illegally denied emergency food stamps
and Medicaid to needy welfare applicants recently rejected the
city's contention that the problem was fixed, and demanded better
monitoring.
</P>
<P>
   In another case, Morel v. Giuliani, a special master required
the city to put in place procedures to ensure that people continued
to receive benefits until a ruling in a fair hearing. A fair
hearing is a state-administered process required by law to give
recipients of benefits a chance to contest the city's decision to
cut them off.
</P>
<P>
   In the current case, the magistrate judge, in addition to
levying fines and ordering fixes, may order any other creative
sanction she chooses if she sees recurrent violations.
</P>
<P>
   AIDS organizations around the city will work out a method of
categorizing complaints and funneling them through the plaintiffs'
lawyers to Pollack, said Armen Merjian, a staff lawyer for Housing
Works, which brought the lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the virtues of this decision is that the magistrate
judge is empowered to hand out penalties, without the plaintiffs'
lawyers having to go back to court to file a separate contempt
motion,'' Merjian said.

DODGERS BEAT DIAMONDBACKS, FINISH FINE SERIES
</HEADLINE>
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ If only the Los Angeles Dodgers had a fourth and
fifth starter this season, maybe what Kevin Brown, Chan Ho Park and
Darren Dreifort did to the Arizona Diamondbacks would have more
significance.
</P>
<P>
   If only the Dodgers had a fourth and fifth starter, maybe Dodger
Stadium would have been sold out rather than hosting an announced
crowd of 31,631 on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   If, if, if. . . . that's what has become of another unfulfilled
season.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Eric Karros led off the bottom of the ninth inning
with a homer as the Dodgers' 1-0 win against Arizona capped a
tremendous, pennant-like series in which Dodgers pitchers allowed
one run in three games.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers also won 1-0 on Tuesday, marking the first time
they've won back-to-back 1-0 games since July 28 and 29, 1984,
against Cincinnati. In sweeping the three-game series against
Arizona, the Dodgers won each game in their final at-bat, with two
via solo homers in the bottom of the ninth inning.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Elster homered to win Monday's game and Karros duplicated
the feat in the finale to break a home-run drought at 28 games, his
longest such streak since 1994. Karros' first homer since Aug. 22
was his 31st of the season and 242nd of his career, tying him with
Roy Campanella for third place in Dodgers history.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be mentioned in that kind of company is kind of
ridiculous,'' said Karros, who received congratulations from Roxie
Campanella, Roy's widow. ``You have those guys and I'm not even
going to kid myself. I don't belong in that company. It's a
longevity deal right now. I'm fortunate enough to have been here
for a few years and been relatively consistent.''
</P>
<P>
   Matt Herges pitched a scoreless ninth inning to improve to 11-3,
including 11-0 in relief appearances.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers' sixth consecutive win, matching a season high,
vaulted them into second place in the National League West for the
first time since June 8. The Dodgers (81-72) also tied a season
high by going nine games over .500.
</P>
<P>
   However, it would take a miracle, if not more, to get the
Dodgers into the playoffs. With nine games left, they trail the
Mets by 5 games in the wild-card race. San Francisco eliminated the
Dodgers from the NL West race with its win against Cincinnati.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not out of this thing yet,'' Karros said. ``Everybody's
written us off. Everybody's talking about how terrible this
organization is and the team is miserable and this and that, but
you know what, we still have a chance.''
</P>
<P>
   The tone for the winning streak, and the sweep of Arizona, was
set by the starting pitchers. Brown, Park and Dreifort didn't allow
a run in 22 innings. The trio is 39-24, a combined record that has
been offset by the fourth and fifth starters, who are 10-25. And
that includes three wins in the last nine days.
</P>
<P>
   ``Get pitching like that every night and I'll be a genius,''
Dodgers manager Davey Johnson said. ``What a great pitching duel
the whole series. The offense was almost nonexistent on both sides,
but I like that better than bombs away. It's a lot more fun to
watch. What a great series.''

INTANGIBLES COMPLICATE WORK ETHICS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE STAFFORD  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star   KANSAS CITY _ To those who see ethical
decisions as clear choices between black and white, Albert Erisman
recommends a second look. Technology, he says, has painted a wide
gray swath in the middle.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sure, it's easy to decide, ``Shall I raid the company vault
tonight?'' But what about, ``Shall I use my company-issued laptop
to surf the Web?''
</P>
<P>
   Erisman, co-founder of the Institute for Business, Technology
and Ethics, says ethical decisions are squishier in the high-tech
knowledge economy, where corporate assets aren't always tangible
and the distinction between what belongs to the company and what
belongs to the employee is blurred.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, it might have been easy to write a workplace rule
that said theft of widgets off the assembly line was a fireable
offense. But when the product is an intangible _ such as knowledge
_ it's difficult for a company to prohibit a worker from walking
out the door with it, Erisman says.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, he suggests, it's no longer clear for many workers
what constitutes work time and what constitutes personal time. And,
while that might not be what some consider an ethical issue, it
certainly raises questions about what is the right thing to do in
terms of compensable hours.
</P>
<P>
   Erisman, who lectured last week at Johnson County Community
College on the new realm of business ethics, took vacation days
from his management job at The Boeing Co. to visit the Kansas City
area and promote awareness of his virtual ethics institute.
</P>
<P>
   For him, in that instance, there was a clear distinction between
work time and personal time. But whose time is it, he asked, when
you return a client's phone call in your car on the way to your
son's football game or read company e-mail from your home at night?
</P>
<P>
   Erisman hopes his 2-year-old ethics institute (Ethix.org on the
Internet) encourages second looks at corporate ethics policies _
``with an eye to fluidity rather than rigidity.''
</P>
<P>
   What he means is that it may be counterproductive, for example,
for employers to ban employees' personal use of company technology.
Stealing is stealing, whether it's widgets or Internet access time.
But organizations need to understand the overriding economic value
of employee loyalty and work//life balance.
</P>
<P>
   If there isn't some squish in the workplace rules, Erisman
opines, it can lead to employees who turn off their beepers, clock
out at quittin' time and say, ``They don't pay me to think.''
</P>
<P>
   Workers, of course, should live up to their ethical end of the
bargain when they navigate the gray area of decision-making.
Neither employer nor employee should misappropriate assets that
belong to the other. And always, Erisman says, there should be
thoughtful consideration of what constitutes the highest good.
</P>
<P>
   ``Plain old-fashioned ethics still apply. There's still right
and wrong. Nothing's changed in that regard,'' Erisman said. ``But
there are more subtle ways of violating privacy, violating trust
and misusing assets. We can't let the fast pace of change take away
our time for reflection and communication about these issues.''

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: The remote Ellis Island'
 &HT;    For release Sept. 24, 2000 or later
 &HT;    By HOWARD KLEINBERG
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ If you leave by speedboat from the environs of Havana
and set a course due north, you'll shortly reach one of an
atoll-like group of uninhabited islands called the Marquesas Keys.
They are part of the United States, between Key West and the Dry
Tortugas.
</P>
<P>
   You land there, you're in America. You've succeeded, according
to Bill Clinton's controversial wet foot/dry foot Cuban Adjustment
Act, in reaching our shores and almost assuredly will not be
repatriated. Therefore, more and more are headed for the Marquesas
as that is the shortest distance between Cuba and the United
States, about 80 miles.
</P>
<P>
   It was thought for a while earlier last week that the Cuban
seaplane that crashed in the Gulf of Mexico was headed for the
Marquesas when it went down, but it actually took a course toward
the Yucatan.
</P>
<P>
   On Sept. 17, the Coast Guard picked up 19 Cubans in the
Marquesas. It was the fifth time this year Cubans reached there,
most under suspicious circumstances, the suspicions being that
smugglers make the short dash there, deposit the refugees and then,
through intermediaries, notify the Coast Guard that people are
stranded on one of the tiny keys that comprise the Marquesas.
</P>
<P>
   At the start of June, 12 Cubans reached the Marquesas rather
than take the more traveled course closer to Florida's Upper Keys
and southeast coast, thus more visible to patrolling Coast Guard
vessels.
</P>
<P>
   On July 9, 18 more Cubans were found in the Marquesas. provided
food and medical attention by Coast Guard, transferred to Key West
and eventually released into the Florida population.
</P>
<P>
   In August, a Cuban fishing boat captain ran his boat aground
onto one of the Marquesas. Aboard were 20 Cubans seeking, and
receiving, asylum and a crew of four that sought, and received,
repatriation to Cuba. The crewmen said they had been drugged and
tied up by their captain.
</P>
<P>
   The most famous arrival in the Marquesas was baseball player
Andy Morales, who arrived there in mid-July. Morales, a star of the
Cuban national baseball team, tried to reach the United States in
June but was interdicted at sea by the Coast Guard and returned to
Cuba. There, a purported surveillance by Castro's security agents
mysteriously disappeared as he made his next try to leave the
island.
</P>
<P>
   Morales reached the Marquesas with eight other refugees aboard a
speedboat. It was admitted by two of them that they paid smugglers
$5,000 each for the several hours-long journey.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Morales is in residence in California with his American
sports agent, awaiting offers from major league baseball teams.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Coast Guard, overwhelmed with patrolling so vast an
area as the Straits of Florida, has a lesser chance of interdicting
smugglers and their passengers on such a short run as the one to
the Marquesas. A quick dash in the middle of the night and the
refugees are on dry land.
</P>
<P>
   During this presidential campaign, it has been asked of each of
the major candidates if they would retain Clinton's Cuba policy, a
portion of which includes the wet foot/dry foot guideline as well
as, I presume, shaking Fidel Castro's hand.
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore said he was comfortable with it, although he differed
with the president on the Elian Gonzalez decision. George W. Bush
at first said he, too, was a supporter of the wet foot/dry foot
policy. But, when Cuban exiles, strong supporters of Republican
candidates and opponents of repatriations, howled that Bush was not
properly tuned in on the situation, the GOP candidate sent a letter
to Rep. Lincoln Diaz-Balart (R-FL) stating that he ``would want to
hear both sides of the argument over current policy toward Cuban
refugees.'' A nice hedge, Dubya.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, as interdiction continues, the Marquesas seems a
prime spot for a late night dash to freedom for Cubans fleeing
Castroism. There's far less exposure in that than trying to raft
all the way up to Miami or going via a change of boats through some
remote Bahamas island.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Buchanan is proof of merits of a two-party system
 &HT;    By Tom Teepen
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Pat Buchanan is back on the political stump doing what he does
best _ foaming at the mouth and reminding us a two-party system
isn't such a bad idea after all.
</P>
<P>
   There's a recurring wistfulness in American political musing on
behalf of the notion that a chautauqua of political minstrels,
scolds and savants would better serve, enlighten and, at a minimum,
entertain us than the de facto two-party system we've almost always
had.
</P>
<P>
   Third parties have at times usefully prodded the system.
</P>
<P>
   Strong Socialist showings in the early 20th century led to the
adoption of child-labor laws, workman's compensation and other
progressive policies. The Reform Party, hijacked by Buchanan for
his own ego trip, disciplined President Clinton and Congress to
balance the budget. Ralph Nader, nominee of the Green Party, is
making trenchant critiques of a political status quo that has
become indifferent to endemic social injustices.
</P>
<P>
   Mostly, though, you get the Pat Buchanans, fringe pop-offs with
axes to grind that, if ever really sharpened and swung, would
bloody the body politic beyond recognition.
</P>
<P>
   Continuing the cultural and religious war he called for at the
1992 GOP convention _ and for which excesses he was slowly eased
out of the party _ Buchanan took up his cause anew at the apt Bob
Jones University, a hard-shell Christian fundamentalist campus
justly infamous for its history of racism and anti-Catholicism. (In
an indulgence of convenience, Buchanan, a theologically right-wing
Catholic, apparently has given the school a bye on the latter.)
</P>
<P>
   There he was, denouncing ``cultural Marxism,'' whatever that may
be, and hammering all his old devils _ immigrants, particularly of
the Mexican sort, gays, foreign trade and the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   All of this is quite vile _ bloody rhetoric for the
empathy-impaired _ but in an election year as bland as this one, it
has the marginal value, inasmuch as it won't go anywhere
politically, of at least being lurid. Buchanan swears, for
instance, he would send 10,000 Marines to pack the U.N. and throw
it out of the country.
</P>
<P>
   Federal courts, Buchanan says, have ``dethroned God,'' which
news will no doubt give the deity a start when he hears it, or when
she does. Actually, we have two presidential tickets dangling their
faith like notions peddlers rattling come-on trinkets.
</P>
<P>
   Both presidential candidates are schmoozing Oprah, so in touch
with their feelings they're close to committing self-incest. George
W. Bush and Al Gore are touting their marital fidelity, Gore all
but jumping Tipper on the convention platform to prove it.
</P>
<P>
   We're spending nearly $13 million in public money, which the
Reform Party qualified for, to subsidize Buchanan's fulminations.
It is money well spent if it reminds us that here in the real
world, the signal differences between the two major parties over
how to handle health care shortfalls, laggard education, abortion,
racial justice and other issues actually matter.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: WAKE UP, LITTLE GEORGIE
 &HT;    Moving in the (k) commentary and (p) political categories for
release Sunday, Sept. 24.
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Folks who tuned into ``Oprah'' on a recent
afternoon learned that George W. Bush would ask the White House
chef to serve him peanut butter and jelly sandwiches on white bread
if he gets to move into the White House.
</P>
<P>
   It's a suitable snack for a self-styled ``average Joe'' kind of
politician _ although one who still managed to attain degrees from
Yale and Harvard Business School and to amass a nest egg worth
millions.
</P>
<P>
   If the Texas governor were running for ``Mr. Nice Guy,'' you
would have to grade his effort as an ``A,'' as in affable,
amenable, amiable and amicable. But is that an adequate argument to
assume the presidency in 2001?
</P>
<P>
   Once, Bush glowed in the aura of an invincible winner. But that
ended in the dog days of August and it's unlikely to return _ even
if he manages, against high odds, to stitch together the 270
electoral votes he needs to win.
</P>
<P>
   In weeks between the Democratic convention and scheduled
presidential debates, the pundit class took to analyzing what
brought the once high-flying Bush campaign down to earth.
</P>
<P>
   CNN's William Schneider homed in on Bush's loss of momentum,
which faltered when the Republican candidate failed to match the
zest shown by Al Gore and Joe Lieberman as they campaigned,
post-Los Angeles, on a Mississippi riverboat, followed by a
whirlwind Labor Day weekend tour.
</P>
<P>
   Notes Schneider: ``Just before Labor Day, half the public said
they thought Bush would win in November. Only a third expected Gore
to win. Those expectations have now been completely reversed.''
</P>
<P>
   That has spawned a death spiral for Bush. As Schneider observes:
``The polls (have shifted) in Gore's favor, which then drives the
press coverage. Gore's favorable press coverage then changes public
expectations.''
</P>
<P>
   As a former fighter pilot in the Texas Air National Guard, Bush
knows he needs to break out of his political stall, or crash.
What's less clear is whether he knows how.
</P>
<P>
   To make the sale on Election Day, Bush the Younger must persuade
enough voters that Gore isn't up to the job, just as eight years
ago Bill Clinton persuaded them that Bush the Elder wasn't up to
the job.
</P>
<P>
   But that often comes across as a mixed message.
</P>
<P>
   On the one hand, Bush would have us believe that under the
Democrats, big government in Washington has sought to hold on to it
all, including money that should rightfully go back to the people
in tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
   On the other, if Clinton and Gore have done too much, then why
did Bush say the other day that ``when you are the vice president,
you're powerful. And he hasn't used his power. And neither has the
president.''?
</P>
<P>
   ``As a matter of fact,'' Bush added (veering away for a bit to
pick up on what has been one of his Dad's favorite themes), ``the
president really disgraced the nation. But that is the sordid
chapter of the past and we are moving forward; that's what America
wants, and that's what I want.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, again thanks to ``Oprah,'' we also know Bush's
favorite song is ``Wake Up, Little Susie.'' As that 1957 ditty put
it: ``We fell asleep. Our goose is cooked. Our reputation is
shot.''

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: WAKE UP, LITTLE GEORGIE
 &HT;    Moving in the (k) commentary and (p) political categories for
release Sunday, Sept. 24.
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Folks who tuned into ``Oprah'' on a recent
afternoon learned that George W. Bush would ask the White House
chef to serve him peanut butter and jelly sandwiches on white bread
if he gets to move into the White House.
</P>
<P>
   It's a suitable snack for a self-styled ``average Joe'' kind of
politician _ although one who still managed to attain degrees from
Yale and Harvard Business School and to amass a nest egg worth
millions.
</P>
<P>
   If the Texas governor were running for ``Mr. Nice Guy,'' you
would have to grade his effort as an ``A,'' as in affable,
amenable, amiable and amicable. But is that an adequate argument to
assume the presidency in 2001?
</P>
<P>
   Once, Bush glowed in the aura of an invincible winner. But that
ended in the dog days of August and it's unlikely to return _ even
if he manages, against high odds, to stitch together the 270
electoral votes he needs to win.
</P>
<P>
   In weeks between the Democratic convention and scheduled
presidential debates, the pundit class took to analyzing what
brought the once high-flying Bush campaign down to earth.
</P>
<P>
   CNN's William Schneider homed in on Bush's loss of momentum,
which faltered when the Republican candidate failed to match the
zest shown by Al Gore and Joe Lieberman as they campaigned,
post-Los Angeles, on a Mississippi riverboat, followed by a
whirlwind Labor Day weekend tour.
</P>
<P>
   Notes Schneider: ``Just before Labor Day, half the public said
they thought Bush would win in November. Only a third expected Gore
to win. Those expectations have now been completely reversed.''
</P>
<P>
   That has spawned a death spiral for Bush. As Schneider observes:
``The polls (have shifted) in Gore's favor, which then drives the
press coverage. Gore's favorable press coverage then changes public
expectations.''
</P>
<P>
   As a former fighter pilot in the Texas Air National Guard, Bush
knows he needs to break out of his political stall, or crash.
What's less clear is whether he knows how.
</P>
<P>
   To make the sale on Election Day, Bush the Younger must persuade
enough voters that Gore isn't up to the job, just as eight years
ago Bill Clinton persuaded them that Bush the Elder wasn't up to
the job.
</P>
<P>
   But that often comes across as a mixed message.
</P>
<P>
   On the one hand, Bush would have us believe that under the
Democrats, big government in Washington has sought to hold on to it
all, including money that should rightfully go back to the people
in tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
   On the other, if Clinton and Gore have done too much, then why
did Bush say the other day that ``when you are the vice president,
you're powerful. And he hasn't used his power. And neither has the
president.''?
</P>
<P>
   ``As a matter of fact,'' Bush added (veering away for a bit to
pick up on what has been one of his Dad's favorite themes), ``the
president really disgraced the nation. But that is the sordid
chapter of the past and we are moving forward; that's what America
wants, and that's what I want.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, again thanks to ``Oprah,'' we also know Bush's
favorite song is ``Wake Up, Little Susie.'' As that 1957 ditty put
it: ``We fell asleep. Our goose is cooked. Our reputation is
shot.''

FRENCHMAN TAKES THE GOLD IN DEBUT OF NEW CYCLING RACE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Pa., Australia, Germany, France)  ATTN: Pa., Germany, France) 
 By MARK LANDLER    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia _ Thursday's running of the keirin cycling
race was a reminder that not all Olympic sports have the heroic
pedigree of the decathlon.
</P>
<P>
   The keirin (pronounced KEE-rin) is making its debut in these
Olympics. It has thrived in Japan since the 1940s, where it is the
object of massive parimutuel betting. The appeal of the race is its
flukiness.
</P>
<P>
   Keirin is an odd duck among cycling events. It is a 2 1/2 lap
sprint that follows 5 1/2laps of riding behind the equivalent of a
pace car. In Japan, that vehicle is a motorcycle. In Sydney, it has
been replaced with a motorized bicycle equipped with a camera and
flashing light pole.
</P>
<P>
   The position of the riders can shift radically in the frantic
jockeying just before the pace bike pulls off the course. If a
rider is hemmed in by other cyclists, he may not be able to
position himself to go for the lead.
</P>
<P>
   That unpredictability proved poison to the top American cyclist,
Marty Nothstein, who on Wednesday won the first cycling gold medal
for the United States in a non-boycott Olympic Games since 1904.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, Nothstein finished a deflating fifth out of six riders
in the keirin. Florian Rousseau of France won with a time of
11.020, while Gary Neiwand of Australia came in second and Jens
Fiedler of Germany finished third.
</P>
<P>
   Nothstein was the sole American racing in a field with two
French and two German riders. That, he said, made him vulnerable to
tactical blocking by riders who were trying to assure victory by a
countryman.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew going in, with two Frenchmen and two Germans, it was
going to be nasty,'' Nothstein said to reporters afterward. ``It's
a new event for the Games and they've got to work out the kinks.''
</P>
<P>
   After the race, Nothstein exchanged words with the second German
rider, Jan van Eijden, whom he said blocked him in the last
half-lap of the race when Nothstein made a final lunge for the
front of the pack.
</P>
<P>
   Blocking to help a teammate is legal and is common practice in
team competition. The gamesmanship did not prevent Neiwand, the
Australian, from winning a silver medal. But clearly, Nothstein was
a more inviting target.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   For an athlete who tumbled from thrilling victory to bitter
defeat in 24 hours, Nothstein seemed remarkably composed. He left
little doubt that he was happier with a gold medal for sprint
racing than for keirin.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sprint has been around since 1896,'' Nothstein said. ``It's
the most prestigious event. That's what I trained for.''
</P>
<P>
   Nothstein's evening began on a shaky note, when he finished
fifth in the first round. After riding in fourth place during the
pace laps _ further back than he normally prefers _ Nothstein found
himself boxed in during the sprint laps, and was unable to break
out of the pack.
</P>
<P>
   In the elimination round, known as the repechage, Nothstein
seized the second position behind Rousseau. Nothstein tailed the
Frenchman until the last quarter lap, when he swerved high on the
banked track and passed Rousseau on the right to win by a half a
wheel length.
</P>
<P>
   In the second round, Nothstein was in the pole position from the
starting gun. He fell briefly to third place as the sprint began,
but exploded in the last lap to overtake Rousseau by more than a
bike-length.
</P>
<P>
   Nothstein said he slept only four hours on Wednesday night after
winning the sprint race. As a result, he felt stiff before the
first round. But he said he warmed up quickly and was in top form
for the final round.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why I was so mad,'' he said with a tight smile.
</P>
<P>
   Nothstein's travails were scarcely noticed by the raucous crowd
at the Olympic Velodrome. They were celebrating an unexpected
victory by an Australian team, Scott McGrory and Brett Aitken, in
the Madison race. The 240-lap race is named for Madison Square
Garden in New York, where it was first run.
</P>
<P>
   Nothstein, a 29-year-old native of Trexlertown, Pa., said the
defeat in keirin would not send him away from Sydney on a sour
note. ``Bike racing is an addiction of mine,'' he said. ``I love
winning.''

   PEDESTRIANS (San Francisco) _ The poster shows a child sitting
in a stroller, his face turned toward a bright headlight. ``Yeah,
you ran that red, but you only killed one person,'' it says. In
another poster, an elderly woman grasping a walker glances over her
shoulder at an approaching car, alarm in her deep-set eyes. ``I'm
sorry I ran over your Grandma, but I didn't want to spill my
latte,'' it says. Those are among the powerful images an ad agency

   B-52 (San Antonio) _ Yet another piece of Kelly Air Force Base
has been packed up and shipped to Oklahoma. Ripped from its perch
overlooking Military Drive, where it had been on display for 16
years, the B-52 didn't look much like the mighty bomber it once
was. Its broken wings were loaded on one 18-wheeler, and its
159-foot-4-inch-long fuselage was cradled on the trailer of another
truck that made agonizingly slow left and right turns. A fixture at
Kelly since 1984, the B-52 left the base Wednesday for a three-day
trip to Tinker AFB in Oklahoma City, where it will be used to
provide training for the 654th Combat Logistics Squadron. By SIG

AS A WEB SITE, `BIG BROTHER' IS A HIT

<P>
   So what if it's only so-so as a TV show? On the Web, it just may
have found a new life.
</P>
<P>
   Bigbrother2000.com, the official Web address of the CBS
television show ``Big Brother,'' was hailed last week as the top
newcomer site in July in Media Metrix's monthly ratings. The
company said that 4.25 million unique visitors logged onto the site
during the month, where they were able to vote on which housemate
should be dismissed or catch up on any episodes they might have
missed.
</P>
<P>
   And that's even without CBS claiming the more obvious domain
name, www.bigbrother.com. That Web site, unrelated to the CBS show,
offers visitors the opportunity to view a collection of Webcams.
Not surprisingly, this site has also experienced a surge in
visitors this summer as Internet users stumble upon it looking for
the reality TV show's Web site.
</P>
<P>
   ``Big Brother,'' which airs six nights a week, follows the daily
lives of a houseful of strangers who have been sequestered together
since July. Critics have labeled the show cheap voyeurism, a poor
second cousin to the hit CBS reality series ``Survivor,'' which
wrapped up its initial series last month.
</P>
<P>
   The current ``Big Brother'' series is scheduled to finish at the
end of September, when the single remaining housemate wins
$500,000.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. reaction to ``Big Brother'' has been vastly different
from the response in Holland, Spain and Germany, where versions of
the program have been runaway hits. And it appears to be vastly
different on the Web, where ``cheap voyeurism'' may be striking a
chord.
</P>
<P>
   Coming in second for Media Metrix's top newcomer site in July
was Bigfatbaby.com, an electronic greeting-card service that
attracted 2 million visitors during the month. Gaspricewatch.com,
which provides research on local gasoline prices, surged in
popularity as well, with 1.364 million visitors in July.

   A Rosier Outlook for Online Holiday Sales
</P>
<P>
   Despite the failures and financial constraints that cast gloom
over the e-commerce sector this summer, the outlook for the holiday
shopping season may give some Internet retailers reason for cheer.
</P>
<P>
   A report to be released on Monday by Jupiter Communications
forecasts that online sales in November and December will reach
$11.6 billion, up 66 percent from the $7 billion that consumers
spent online in the corresponding period in 1999. Jupiter predicts
that travel-related purchases will account for $2.6 billion of this
total, and retail sles will comprise the other $9 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Although this represents a healthy increase over last year's
figures, it indicates a slowdown from the triple-digit growth rate
experienced from 1998 to 1999. Online holiday sales in 1999 were
126 percent higher than sales in the period in 1998, which totaled
$3.1 billion.
</P>
<P>
   As for which retailers stand to reap the biggest share of the
online shopping market, Ken Cassar, a senior analyst for Jupiter,
said companies that sell luxury goods, which suffered from a lack
of supply last year, should see the biggest increase in sales.
</P>
<P>
   ``This year, the manufacturers are beginning to become willing
to authorize the sale of their products online,'' Cassar said.
</P>
<P>
   But those looking for predictions about how total holiday sales
will be split between different product categories will have to
wait until the electronic equivalent of cash-register receipts are
in.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even estimating the holiday season is a tenuous task,'' Cassar
said. ``To break that down even further, you'd be just guessing.''
</P>
<P>
   Whereas the focus last year for most e-commerce companies was on
gaining market share, the emphasis this year is on profitability.
For that reason, Cassar suggested that the companies that succeed
would be those that go after customers who already appreciate the
need for their product, have the means to buy it and are willing to
buy it online.
</P>
<P>
   ``The retailers that are going to win are going to be those that
realistically assess the low-hanging fruit in their markets,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Jupiter forecasts that there will be 48 million people shopping
online by the end of 2000, and 6 million of them will make their
first purchase during this year's holiday season. That compares
with 32 million people who had shopped online by the end of 1999.

MOST FEDERAL WEB SITES LACK PRIVACY STANDARDS SET BY FEDERAL TRADE 
COMMISSION
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Most federal Web sites do not meet the commercial
standards for Internet privacy set by the Federal Trade Commission,
including the commission's own site, a government report has found.
</P>
<P>
   Republican lawmakers, led by Rep. Dick Armey of Texas, the House
majority leader, and Rep. Billy Tauzin of Louisiana, the chairman
of the House Commerce Subcommittee on Consumer Protection,
requested that the General Accounting Office assess the privacy
standards of federal government Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   The study released last week by the accounting office, the
investigative agency of Congress, found that virtually all of the
federal sites, including those of the Internal Revenue Service, the
Postal Service and every cabinet-level agency, failed to meet the
government's four main privacy standards. Only 3 percent of federal
sites met the four standards.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration criticized the study's findings.
Sally Katzen, the deputy director for management at the White House
Office of Management and Budget, called the report ``seriously
misleading.''
</P>
<P>
   Federal agencies, Katzen wrote in a letter to investigators
dated Sept. 7, had been directed to follow the Privacy Act of 1974
and internal rules on Web site policies rather than the
commission's standards.
</P>
<P>
   It has been a ``longstanding practice,'' Katzen wrote in a
letter released with the report, ``to tailor privacy laws and
policies to the needs of the particular sector.''
</P>
<P>
   The accounting office measured the government Web sites against
the four FTC standards for Internet privacy: that sites disclose
its information practices before personal data is collected from
consumers; that sites allow consumers to decide if their personal
information may be used for secondary purposes, like having their
names placed on marketing lists; that consumers have access to
personal data, with the option to change it if it is incorrect or
incomplete; and that the site protect against unauthorized access
to personal information.
</P>
<P>
   Armey said that government agencies like the Internal Revenue
Service and the Department of Health and Human Services, which have
``access to many of your personal medical records,'' should be held
to clear and strict standards.
</P>
<P>
   ``You are required to give this information to the government _
you have no choice,'' Armey said. ``You don't have to use a
commercial Web site if you feel it has a bad privacy policy.''
</P>
<P>
   The study, conducted in July and August, found that most federal
Web sites, 85 percent, posted a privacy notice of some kind.
Sixty-nine percent of the sites provided enough information about
how personal data is used to meet the federal requirements.
</P>
<P>
   But in the other categories, the report found, the government
Web sites lacked rigid privacy and security standards. Forty-five
percent of the sites met the commission's criteria for providing
consumers with the option to block outside use of their personal
information; 24 percent provided ample protection against
unauthorized access; and 17 percent permitted consumers to view and
change data.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the report said, third-party devices known as
cookies were permitted on 14 percent of the federal Web sites.
Those devices, often used by marketing organizations, track a
person's movements on the Web. The agencies and departments
studied, in comments not published in the report, argued that
standards for commercial sites did not appropriately apply to
federal sites.

<P>
   Aside from figuring out how to make a profit, one of the more
imposing tasks for Internet companies has been breaking through the
wall of mistrust that separates them from millions of would-be
shoppers who fret about online privacy.
</P>
<P>
   Companies have posted privacy policies. They have used so-called
seal programs offered by organizations like the Better Business
Bureau or Truste. And they have advertised heavily to woo
recalcitrant shoppers to their sites. Still, the doubts remain:
most Internet users who have not shopped online cite inadequate
privacy as the main reason, analysts say. And a survey earlier this
year by the research firm Odyssey determined that 92 percent of
online households do not trust online companies to keep their
information private, no matter what they promise.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the more fearless sites are now putting their
reputations on the line, quite publicly, by paying well-known
financial services firms to audit their World Wide Web sites and
state whether or not their privacy policies are more than just
pixels on the screen. In doing so, analysts and privacy advocates
said, these Web sites are putting pressure on other e-commerce
companies to follow suit, no matter how costly such audits might
be.
</P>
<P>
   Expedia.com, the travel site owned by Microsoft, is the latest
company to subject its privacy policies to an audit _ in this case,
by the firm PricewaterhouseCoopers. Expedia said that starting
today, the PricewaterhouseCoopers seal, a small box with the
company's logo, would appear next to its new privacy policy, along
with a statement by PricewaterhouseCoopers attesting that Expedia
practices what it preaches. ``This won't directly increase sales,''
said Suzi LeVine, Expedia's marketing manager. ``But it will
increase customer confidence in the site. And that, combined with
all the services we provide, will increase sales.''
</P>
<P>
   LeVine said the company has been revamping its privacy policy
and working with PricewaterhouseCoopers for several months.
Notably, Expedia's policy states that the Web site will not sell or
share a customer's personal information with third parties, unless,
for instance, the customer is buying a plane ticket or a trip and
the company needs that information to complete the transaction.
</P>
<P>
   To enforce that promise and others, Expedia paid
PricewaterhouseCoopers an undisclosed sum _ which analysts said was
probably in the six-figure range _ to visit Expedia's offices and
investigate how it handles customer data. Larry Ponemon, the global
leader of PricewaterhouseCoopers' privacy practice, declined to
comment specifically on what the firm found at Expedia. But he
said, ``A vast majority of companies fail the early stages of the
audit,'' either because of how their employees handle customer data
or because their systems do not adequately protect that data.
</P>
<P>
   PricewaterhouseCoopers typically works with the companies to
refine the way they handle data until they can receive a clean
audit, Ponemon said. But if a Web site refuses to change its
practices to conform to its own privacy policies, he said,
PricewaterhouseCoopers' contract requires the site to post an
unfavorable audit statement for the duration of the audit term _
usually three months.
</P>
<P>
   In opting for a public audit of its privacy practices, Expedia
won raves from analysts. ``I think it's great that Expedia has
seized the lead, and I'm not surprised,'' said Henry H. Harteveldt,
senior analyst with Forrester Research, an Internet consulting
firm. ``It shows the bar is getting raised regarding what online
companies must do to make consumers confident on the Web.''
</P>
<P>
   Harteveldt said that among Internet users who did not buy
travel-related products this year, 22 percent said they had
demurred because of privacy concerns. ``If companies like Expedia
can convince even one-tenth of those people to buy, that's a lot of
customers,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said E-Loan, an online lending firm, was the first
e-commerce company to post results of a privacy audit from one of
the Big Five accounting firms, having done so with
PricewaterhouseCoopers early last year. Chris Larsen, E-Loan's
chief executive, said the audit was a response to a controversy
last year surrounding Microsoft and Truste, a nonprofit
organization that provides a seal to sites that meet its privacy
standards.
</P>
<P>
   That controversy arose when Truste failed to audit or otherwise
penalize Microsoft, a Truste investor and member, after it was
disclosed that Microsoft's system software, Windows, collected the
hardware identification numbers of some PC users and sent that to
Microsoft without the users' consent. Privacy advocates said
Truste's seal program lacked teeth. Truste said that its seal
covered only Microsoft's Web site _ not its software _ and that the
data Microsoft gathered was not transmitted to Microsoft's Web
site.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Larsen said he ``completely lost faith in Truste
after that,'' so he hired PricewaterhouseCoopers to perform an
initial audit of E-Loan's privacy practices and post the results on
the E-Loan Web site. That effort cost roughly $250,000 in fees and
staff time, an E-loan spokeswoman said. In addition, E-Loan pays
PricewaterhouseCoopers an additional $30,000 for each quarterly
audit. As to what effect the audit has had on business, Larsen
said: ``It's hard to tell. People have been widely supportive of
it, but I see it more as a prerequisite to doing business.
Consumers have an expectation of privacy.''
</P>
<P>
   Privacy advocates are, predictably, pleased with those who have
gone public with audits, but say more protections are necessary.
``We still need baseline legislation so we can go after bad actors,
and we need better technologies that will increase privacy,'' said
Ari Schwartz, senior policy analyst for the Center for Democracy
and Technology, a privacy group based in Washington. ``But this is
an extremely necessary piece of the puzzle.''

A STABLE OF MAGAZINES ENTERS E-TAIL 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By SAUL HANSELL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In its September issue, Vogue magazine declared that
the look of the moment was knee-length tweed coats. Starting
Monday, Vogue's corporate parent will set out to show that the
business of the moment is selling those coats, and other must-have
fashions, on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   The new Web site, Style.Com, will incorporate fashion sense from
Vogue, W magazine and eventually other titles owned by the Conde
Nast and Fairchild units of Advance Publications.
</P>
<P>
   Like its print cousins, Style.com will be filled with news,
gossip and pictures from the world of fashion as well as its
editor's edicts on the shape, color, style and fabrics for the
well-dressed woman. What is different from the magazines is that
the site soon will enable users to act upon those edicts by
instantly buying the items they are told they must have. Think of
it as point-and-click from the fashion clique.
</P>
<P>
   To let the public become acquainted with the site, Style.com
will begin with a few charity auctions. But in time for the holiday
shopping season, Style.com's planners intend to be running a
bustling bazaar.
</P>
<P>
   The Style.com store is expected to feature some big-name
designers of the sort featured in Vogue and W, like Chanel and
Manolo Blahnik, and the store will be run by Neiman Marcus, a unit
of Harcourt General. Eventually, Advance also hopes to develop its
own Style.com brand of what it calls ``basics'' _ the polite term
for the sort of private label designer knock-offs that are the most
profitable part of the fashion industry.
</P>
<P>
   Combining editorial content with e-commerce is nothing new on
the Web. Think of the links many sites, including that of The New
York Times, have to online booksellers or the extensive paid
computer-product listings on the CNet and ZDNet technology-news
services.
</P>
<P>
   But Advance's effort may be the most ambitious effort yet by an
established publisher to combine reading with retailing. And
Style.com has broken new ground by overcoming some big-name
designers' resistance to potentially diluting their cachet by
selling wares online.
</P>
<P>
   Advance Publications executives say they have been forced to
consider new approaches because they have little hope of
replicating the company's enormously profitable fashion magazine
business on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Internet doesn't work yet for fashion advertisers who are
accustomed to running in Vogue with fabulous photography on great
paper,'' said Sarah Chubb, the president of Advance's CondeNet
unit, which runs Style.com. Nonetheless, she said, the company's
franchise gives it a huge untapped opportunity because many women
use its magazines essentially as shopping catalogs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know people have been buying out of Vogue for years,'' she
said, noting that the magazine prints the names of stores that
carry the items it features. ``We always moaned that we could never
capture any of those sales.''
</P>
<P>
   There is a big difference, of course, between telling readers
where to buy something and actually selling it to them _ or even
making it for them. And these new roles are fraught with both
financial and ethical uncertainties. But the rise of the Internet,
with its infinite possibilities and cruel realities, has prompted
many publishers to consider radically new business models.
</P>
<P>
   ``All over the industry, the lines between advertising and
editorial are increasingly getting blurred,'' said Carolyn Kitch, a
former editor at Good Housekeeping who now runs the magazine
journalism program at Temple University. ``The problems are greater
online, because publishing companies still don't know whether the
Web should primarily be used as an e-commerce tool or an editorial
tool.''
</P>
<P>
   Kitch contends that by moving too much toward commerce, the
publishers are putting short-term gains above their long-term
interests.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a problem that is industrywide that ultimately will
compromise the editorial identity of the Web sites,'' she said.
``Readers will get annoyed. They are pretty sophisticated and don't
want to be told where to shop.''
</P>
<P>
   Chubb counters that she believes Style.com's readers will
appreciate the convenience of being able to order the goods the
site features. Moreover, she says that the company has taken great
pains to avoid misleading readers. Every page of the site will say
that Neiman Marcus pays a commission on each sale to Advance
Publications. And one reason the site is using a new name rather
than being called, say, Vogue.com is to keep the magazine brands
pure.
</P>
<P>
   ``Style.com is going to the market as a commerce brand,'' she
said. ``The magazines and Vogue.com have to be above the fray from
an editorial standpoint.''
</P>
<P>
   For Neiman Marcus, however, it is precisely the reputation of
Vogue and W that makes the deal so appealing.
</P>
<P>
   ``The editorial staffs of these magazines are driving the
thought process in customers' minds that say she should carry this
handbag this year,'' said Karen Katz, chief executive of Neiman
Marcus' catalog and Internet unit. ``It generates a call to action
that we can be the beneficiary of.''
</P>
<P>
   After the warm-up phase of charity auctions in November,
Style.com will introduce its first set of fashion features with
editors' picks linked to Neiman Marcus, primarily items intended
for holiday gift-giving. A broader array of items will be
introduced next year, with the merchandise tending toward
prestigious designer brands.
</P>
<P>
   In another phase, the site will be broadened substantially, with
content tied to Advance Publications' midbrow titles _
Mademoiselle, Jane and Glamour _as well as its men's magazines, GQ
and Details. At that point, executives say, the site will probably
add another retailer, like Macy's or Nordstrom, that specializes in
fashion not quite as pricey as Neiman Marcus'. Still to be
determined is whether to let this retailer handle the private label
basics or whether to create a Style.com label.

NEW ECONOMY: DARPA'S FANTASTIC PROJECTS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By BARNABY J. FEDER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   For more than 40 years, the Defense Advanced Research Projects
Agency has had the daunting assignment of making sure that no enemy
_ or, for that matter, any current friend _ has access to
tomorrow's technology faster than does the Defense Department.
</P>
<P>
   DARPA, as the agency is known, has parceled out billions of
dollars for research projects that can often seem risky, even
far-fetched. But the agency assumes that the really disruptive
innovations are rarely obvious in their early stages.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anytime you propose something that's clearly achievable, they
say it's not a DARPA problem,'' said Jon Sherbeck, vice president
for engineering at Mdot Aerospace, a Phoenix-based startup company
that won a small-business award from the agency recently for
designing a gas turbine the size of a D-cell battery.
</P>
<P>
   Much of what turns out to be feasible never makes it beyond
demonstration projects. Military and congressional politics create
some roadblocks and changing military priorities throw up others.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, no other organization has so frequently if
unintentionally served as midwife to the technologies of today's
information-driven economy. DARPA gave birth to the Internet in the
late 1960s. Other projects helped create many of the nation's most
impressive computers, the chips used in cellular phones and vital
networking technologies, like the ability to send simultaneous
signals of many wavelengths down a single fiber optic cable.
</P>
<P>
   What's next? Well, as the agency told more than 1,000 engineers
and high-technology executives who recently attended a three-day
symposium in Dallas that summarized its current agenda, the next
decade or two is likely to see extremes in miniaturization like
molecule-size computers and six-inch spy planes. Machines, men and,
perhaps, other living organisms like insects fitted with sensors
will be joined in information networks of bewildering complexity
for all sorts of military uses. The torrent of information could
make today's network flow seem like a slow trickle.
</P>
<P>
   Breakthroughs in biology and new materials could also create
surprising new possibilities. The new materials include amorphous
metals that resist corrosion and, unlike normal crystalline metals,
become harder under stress.
</P>
<P>
   For a relatively simple example of the agency's perspective,
consider one of today's military mainstays, the Abrams tank. These
battlefield wonders are more maneuverable and lethal than any other
tank in operation. Their ability to aim accurately at enemy objects
and fire on the move is unprecedented. With twice the range of
Iraq's Russian-designed tanks, they played a major role in NATO's
total domination of Iraq's larger army in the Persian Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
   But to the advanced projects agency and some Army officials
thinking about combat in the future, such large tanks are probably
at an evolutionary dead end. Seen through the lens of the
Information Age, the functions of a tank would be scattered across
a combat network. A variety of robotic cannons and missile
launchers could deliver the firepower, supplementing their built-in
intelligence with help from a distant, manned command center.
Smaller, quicker armored vehicles with single large guns and just
one or two crew members might also have a role.
</P>
<P>
   A variety of heat, light and motion sensors on the ground and in
the air could be networked to provide a much better picture of
fighting conditions. Data would pour in not just from the ground
vehicles but from satellites, low-flying miniature aircraft and,
perhaps, thousands of pollen-size sensors floating like dust or
attached to insects.
</P>
<P>
   With military budgets shrinking and private-sector information
technology development growing at an explosive pace, the advanced
projects agency is increasingly looking for ways to repackage
civilian technology for the military as a cost-effective
alternative to sponsoring novel projects. Unfortunately, the
networks and information systems the private sector is promoting
look disturbingly brittle, threadbare and unsuitable for military
purposes.
</P>
<P>
   ``B2B and enterprise software are low-hanging fruit technically
compared to defense needs,'' said Shankar Sastry, director of the
agency's Information Technology Office, referring to products that
allow businesses to interact with each other over the Internet and
software that allows many parts of an enterprise, from finance to
production to marketing, to share data.
</P>
<P>
   DARPA studies are looking at how to create and manage networks
of up to 100,000 components that must be quickly able to shift how
they communicate. Some components may periodically change functions
_ a device, for instance, might be monitoring radio signals at one
moment and jamming them the next.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, the agency is financing research on networks of
information users. It wants the Defense Department to be able to
set up coalitions of up to 100 allies capable of sharing secure
information and coordinating logistics within minutes. Just as
important, it wants to be able to cut a party off a network
instantly and notify all other members.
</P>
<P>
   In both cases, the need for artificial intelligence is obvious.
Even if the ability of humans to interact easily with computers
were vastly improved by, say, flawless voice recognition software,
the amount of information flooding in would be overwhelming. The
agency's response includes research on software that can screen
widely diverse data sources for relevant trends, automatically
reshape networks and write new programs to respond rapidly to
emerging needs.
</P>
<P>
   One project partly addressing such concerns is the effort to
develop so-called DARPA agent markup language. DAML, as the
language is known in technical circles, would create a universal
format for telling computers what kind of information is in a data
source. It would allow Internet search machines to extract data not
just from the World Wide Web but from computer programs, sensors
and other machines.
</P>
<P>
   The computer language embodies one of the major changes the
agency has confronted in adapting to the Information Age. While
much of the agency's work still focuses on technology that it would
just as soon see stay in American military hands, there are a
growing number of developments that will go nowhere unless they
also permeate civilian life.

TECHNIQUES THAT CAN HELP MAKE REITS A ROCK-SOLID INVESTMENT
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  By HARRY DOMASH  
c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   If you find 8 percent dividend yields plus the possibility of
capital appreciation appealing, consider Real Estate Investment
Trusts. You can use the Internet to find and research REITs. First,
some background.
</P>
<P>
   REITs are publicly traded corporations formed to invest solely
in real estate. Equity REITs own commercial real estate such as
apartment complexes, office buildings, shopping centers, health
care facilities, hotels and the like. Mortgage REITs lend money to
real estate developers and typically don't own property.
</P>
<P>
   The primary source of income for equity REITs is rents collected
on their properties, and government regulations require REITs to
distribute most of their income directly to shareholders in the
form of dividends.
</P>
<P>
   Dividend yield is the price you pay for the shares divided by
the annual dividends. For instance, you would receive a 10 percent
yield if you paid $10 per share for a REIT distributing $1 per
share annually to stockholders. If the share price doubled the next
day, new investors would only receive a 5 percent yield on the same
shares.
</P>
<P>
   Even though REIT share prices are up this year, you can still
find plenty of REITs with dividend yields of 8 percent, and
sometimes, much higher.
</P>
<P>
   Your returns (dividend yield plus the share price appreciation)
will be even higher if the share price increases, but that's a
two-way street. Share prices can go down as well as up. REITs are
best suited to investors with a long enough time horizon to outwait
market cycles.
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, you want REITs with high dividend yields, but you
also have to be confident that the payouts will continue, or better
yet, increase, as time goes on.
</P>
<P>
   Your REIT selection strategy should focus on finding REITs with
high current dividend yields, and determining whether those yields
are likely to increase or decrease while you own the shares.
</P>
<P>
   FINDING HIGH-YIELDING REITS: Hoover's StockScreener
(www.stockscreener.com) is a good place to find high-yielding
REITs. It is the only screening tool I have found that allows you
to search based upon such REIT sectors as Healthcare Facilities,
Hotel/Motel, Industrial, Office, Residential, and Retail.
</P>
<P>
   Because dividend yield rises when the share price drops, you
will find the highest yields (and the most risk) in recently
out-of-favor sectors. The industrial and residential sectors have
experienced the strongest stock price appreciation during recent
months, while retail and health care have been the weakest.
</P>
<P>
   Use the Industry Group dropdown menu to pick a REIT sector. I
selected ``REIT-Office'' to illustrate the process. Hoover's
StockScreener gives you 20 stock selection parameters, but we only
need one, Dividend Yield, located near the bottom, on the right.
</P>
<P>
   I don't want to bother with REITS with less than a 5 percent
yield. So, given that, specify 5 percent by typing ``5'' into the
minimum (left) box, and leave the maximum blank. Click on ``Go'' to
run the search and then print the resulting list.
</P>
<P>
   Dividend yields within a particular industry sector usually fall
within a range. In this case, nine of the 11 office REITs listed
had yields in the 5.0 to 8.8 percent range. Two, however, HRPT
Properties Trust, and PMC Commercial Trust, showed yields of 11.6
percent and 17.7 percent, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   It's easier to piggyback on the work of research analysts
employed by major brokerage houses than to do the analysis
ourselves.
</P>
<P>
   RULE OUT THE DOGS: Yahoo (finance.yahoo.com) is a good resource
for analysts' earnings forecasts and buy, hold or sell
recommendations. (Hoover's didn't list the ticker symbols, so look
them up using the ``symbol lookup'' link near the ``Get Quotes''
entry box.)
</P>
<P>
   I started with HRPT Properties, one of the highest-yielding
REITs on my list. Enter the ticker symbol, HRP, into the entry box.
Select ``Research'' from the dropdown menu and click Get Quotes.
You should see ``Research _ Hrpt Pptys Trst'' near the top of the
page. Click the ``Research'' link if you see a price quote instead.
</P>
<P>
   Scroll down to the area labeled ``Consensus EPS Trend'' in the
Earnings Estimates and Recommendations section. You will see the
current consensus analysts' earnings forecasts for HRPT Properties,
along with earlier forecasts going back 90 days, as well as for the
current and next quarter (three months), and the current and next
fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
   Use the fiscal year forecasts. REIT analysts pay more attention
to cash flow than reported earnings. However, cash flow comes from
earnings and we can get useful information from the earnings
forecasts.
</P>
<P>
   When I looked last week, analysts were forecasting earnings of
$1.39 per share for both this fiscal year (Dec '00), and next
fiscal year (Dec '01). That's bad, because these analysts don't
think HRPT's earnings are going to increase next year.
</P>
<P>
   Earnings growth leads to dividend increases. Flat earnings don't
work. Even worse, 90 days ago, the consensus forecast was higher:
$1.40 for 2000, and $1.44 for 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Something happened to make analysts cut their forecasts. Either
factor _ the lack of forecast earnings growth, or cuts in earnings
forecasts _ makes it unlikely that you'll see any dividend
increases.
</P>
<P>
   The analysts' buy, hold or sell recommendations are shown to the
right of the earnings forecasts. Analysts don't like to issue sell
recommendations. Instead, they say ``hold'' when they mean
``sell.'' Six of seven analysts have ``hold'' recommendations on
HRPT. That's disheartening.
</P>
<P>
   Any of the factors we uncovered by themselves such as no
earnings growth, recent earnings forecast reductions, or a
preponderance of ``hold'' recommendations should be enough take a
REIT out of consideration.
</P>
<P>
   I eliminated PMC Commercial Trust and two other candidates with
8.8 percent yields based on the same considerations. The best
candidate, in terms of yield, passing my weeding-out process was
Bedford Property Management, with an 8.5 percent payout.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, there's more research to do before you buy, and I'll
cover that in a future column.

   STABLE JOB MARKET: Georgia ranked 17th overall in a FlipDog.com
survey that gauged job opportunities. In its monthly Job
Opportunity Index, the Georgia job market was ranked ``stable,'' as
opposed to competitive or tough, said Brett Walker, FlipDog's vice
president of marketing. ``There are a pretty good number of
opportunities available and a pretty good number of people who'd
qualify for those opportunities.'' Also, employers in Georgia had a
good chance of filling jobs with local talent rather than having to
scour the country for workers, Walker said. Georgia ranked 13th in
actual number of jobs available. Flipdog.com found about 14,000
jobs posted online for Georgia jobs. Massachusetts ranked No. 1
overall. Mississippi and West Virginia ranked at the bottom. _

 &HT;    Role of Internet not yet living up to billing
 &HT;    By Caroline Hubbard
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA - Mark Moore plans to revolutionize the way wholesalers
buy and sell food.
</P>
<P>
   His Internet marketplace, GlobalFoodExchange.com, will reduce
companies' inventory, guarantee freshness and save both buyers and
sellers a bunch of money.
</P>
<P>
   At least that is the plan.
</P>
<P>
   A year and a half after Moore founded his company and six months
after he snagged $13 million in venture capital, the vast majority
of transactions in the $800 billion food industry still are done
the old-fashioned way _ with salespeople. GlobalFoodExchange is
doing just ``hundreds'' of transactions per month, Moore said.
Still, GlobalFoodExchange and its many competitors believe the
future of food is online.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, in almost every industry, the visionaries believe that
streamlining buying, selling and other business functions by using
the Internet is the way to save millions of dollars. Those dollars,
the theory goes, drop right to the bottom line. That streamlining
cuts the cost of doing business and is the great promise of the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the fulfillment of that promise is taking longer to realize
than anyone thought it would a year ago, when so-called
business-to-business Internet companies were popping up in every
industry sector. They were collecting and spending venture capital
at a furious pace. The future looked great. The markets were kind.
</P>
<P>
   That was then. Now the markets have soured, the venture
capitalists have become more conservative and the big clients are
thinking longer and harder about where and how to spend their
Internet-aimed dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, the promise of the Internet is still greasing the wheels of
a torrid economy, but the whole process is slowing.
</P>
<P>
   ``B-to-b is evolving ... the models are still being figured
out,'' said Martin Tilson, a lawyer at Kilpatrick Stockton who
works with a number of business-to-business companies.
</P>
<P>
   There likely will be consolidations because some industries _
such as food _ have tons of players.
</P>
<P>
   Moore said he has already seen GlobalFoodExchange's competition
drop from 20 companies to about six. He attributes the drop to ``a
combination of consolidation and erosion.'' Some companies have
merged, some have gone under and some have narrowed their focus so
that they no longer compete with GlobalFoodExchange, Moore said.
</P>
<P>
   In the beginning, start-ups were launching the marketplaces.
Companies such as GlobalFoodExchange raised venture capital and set
about luring traditional companies to the sites as buyers and
sellers. But there is a new trend of ``old economy'' companies
banding together to form their own marketplaces and bypass the
start-ups.
</P>
<P>
   There are a handful of such consortia in Atlanta. Some large
chemical companies including BASF, Bayer, Dow, DuPont and
Ticona/Celanese launched Omnexus, which is housed in Andersen
Consulting's incubator. In another example, Georgia-Pacific Corp.,
International Paper and Weyerhaeuser Co. are launching
forestexpress.com here.
</P>
<P>
   No one yet knows for sure which business model _ start-up or
consortium of older companies _ will work better. Although the
companies started by industry leaders have access to lots of supply
and capital right away, there are problems with longtime
competitors working together. Plus, big companies aren't used to
moving at Internet speed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The consortia don't realize how difficult this is, the
technical issues, the financing issues, the staffing issues,'' said
Mike Dowdle, who heads the venture program at iXL and works with a
number of young business-to-business companies.
</P>
<P>
   Dowdle predicted that in some industries the start-ups and
consortia may join forces. ``We are going to see more partnering,
acquiring, merging,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, investors, hot for business-to-business six months
ago, have cooled. Faring only slightly better with investors than
business-to-business marketplaces are application service
providers. An ASP hosts software on a server and then ``rents'' it
to companies that don't want to pay a big upfront fee to buy the
software and/or have to fool with maintaining the software.
Customers access the software through the Internet, typically
paying either a monthly fee or a fee for every transaction done
with the software.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta is home to a handful of application service providers,
which provide everything from employee benefits information for
small businesses to desktop applications for attorneys. One local
company, ePanacea, which grouped together ASPs and sold the
services to companies, recently ran out of money. Unable to raise
more, it closed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The b-to-b world has taken longer to pan out than investors
thought it would, in terms of people getting customers, in terms of
people generating revenue, in terms of people hitting milestones,''
said Ed McCrady, a banker at Robertson Stephens who raises capital
for technology companies. ``Now, investors are realizing this could
be a 10- to 15-year process, not a 10- to 15-month process, like
some people thought in 1999.''
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta entrepreneurs, some of whom list the local venture
capital scene as the biggest drawback to starting a company here,
may be particularly frustrated by the lack of available funding.
</P>
<P>
   The city is not home to any huge venture capital funds.
Noro-Moseley Partners recently raised a $320 million fund, the
largest ever for the city but still nowhere near the billion-dollar
funds in Silicon Valley, New York and Boston. Because the funds
here are small, a local venture capitalist is more likely to invest
$2 million to $5 million instead of $10 million to $20 million.
</P>
<P>
   Plus, local investors are more conservative.
</P>
<P>
   Moore, who is raising his second round of financing, said local
investors are scared to take a chance on a company such as
GlobalFoodExchange that is still losing lots of money. His
investors will be from outside Atlanta, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The (local) venture capital community is waiting for
significant revenue to invest,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Karen See, president of technology marketing firm Abovo
Marketing, has 20 clients. Most get their first rounds of capital
locally but look elsewhere for the second _ and larger _ round of
funding, she said. She said Atlanta is known on the West Coast for
its ``chicken money. Everyone is chicken to put in the big
dollars.''
</P>
<P>
   Though venture capital may be a weak spot, Atlanta has plenty of
bright spots for business-to-business companies. Perhaps Atlanta's
biggest selling point, ironically, is its ``old economy'' companies
_ ones like Georgia-Pacific, United Parcel Service, BellSouth and
Coca-Cola.
</P>
<P>
   ``In some ways, Atlanta is more conducive to
business-to-business than Silicon Valley, which is surrounded by
the software industry. It isn't in tune with corporate America,''
said Moore, who has been able to find plenty of food industry
experts to hire in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta executives are used to selling inside big companies and
have key contacts, Dowdle said. ``You've got to have experienced
people who know how to work the hallways of the big, big
companies,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta, like other so-called technology cities, has the
infrastructure to help business-to-business companies get off the
ground: attorneys who are used to dealing with start-ups; real
estate brokers who know how to work a lease for high-risk,
fast-growing company; a network of angel investors and venture
capitalists; and Internet consulting companies that help companies
figure out an Internet strategy.
</P>
<P>
   Other bright spots are a relatively low cost of living, a strong
fiber network and an airport that makes traveling around the world
relatively easy.
</P>
<P>
   In a report released as part of its January investors'
conference, Atlanta-based investment bank Robinson-Humphrey Co. set
out broad claims for ``Netlanta,'' arguing that Atlanta has
mimicked Silicon Valley in five critical ways: universities,
research, industry leadership, venture capital and culture. While
metro Atlanta cannot match the magnitude of the Valley forces, it
has assembled the same equation in smaller doses, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   Pointing to Omnexus and other companies that have recently
chosen to put headquarters in Atlanta, Tilson said, ``Atlanta is
being seen as a great place to start a business-to-business
company.''

<P>
   B2B GLOSSARY: Understanding the language of business-to-business
operations
</P>
<P>
   c. 2000 Cox News Service
</P>
<P>
   ASP: This stands for application service provider. An ASP hosts
software on a server and then ``rents'' it to companies that don't
want to pay a big upfront fee to buy the software and/or have to
maintain it. Customers access the software through the Internet,
typically paying either a monthly fee or a charge for every
transaction done with the software.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta example: Atlanta-based EAttorney is an application
service provider for the legal industry. Small and medium-size law
firms can pay a monthly fee of $40 to $75 per person to access
software for attorneys' desktops.
</P>
<P>
   AUCTION: A site where many buyers are bidding for one seller's
product or service.
</P>
<P>
   BURN RATE: This is the term for how fast a company is spending
its capital. Investors are increasingly concerned about ``burn
rate''; they don't want to invest in business-to-business companies
that plan to spend a whole lot of money to get their businesses
going but don't expect substantial revenue any time soon.
</P>
<P>
   CATALOG MARKETPLACES: A place where buyers can shop for things
with set prices. It allows comparison shopping.
</P>
<P>
   DISINTERMEDIATION: When the middleman gets cut out of the deal.
At a marketplace that connects buyers and sellers in real time on
the Internet, there theoretically is no need for salespeople to
haggle and schmooze in-person, on the phone and via fax.
</P>
<P>
   DOMAIN EXPERTISE: Industry smarts. Investors expect a company to
have executives who know a great deal about the industry that the
business-to-business company is going after.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta example: One of CarrierPoint's co-founders, John
Thomson, previously did consulting work with shippers attempting to
improve their warehousing and logistics operations. CarrierPoint is
a marketplace for the trucking industry.
</P>
<P>
   EXIT STRATEGY: Investors want to know when they are going to
cash out, either through an initial public offering or a sale to a
larger company.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta example: Tradex, which has technology for marketplaces,
was sold to Ariba for $1.9 billion. Investors, including Atlantan
John Imlay, made a lot of money.
</P>
<P>
   FIRST-MOVER ADVANTAGE: Accrues to the first company to go after
a certain market. If a company can establish itself early as the
leader, it is harder for competitors to gain a foothold.
</P>
<P>
   FRAGMENTED MARKETPLACE: An industry in which it is difficult for
buyers and sellers to find each other. If a market is highly
fragmented, then an Internet marketplace that can help create
relationships is more valuable.
</P>
<P>
   PATH-TO-PROFITABILITY: How quickly the company is going to be
making money and how it is going to do it. The term P2P is popular
among B2B companies trying to convince investors that they will
make money.
</P>
<P>
   REVERSE AUCTION: When one buyer offers a particular price for a
product, attracting bids from many sellers.
</P>
<P>
   SCALABILITY: How quickly and efficiently a company can increase
its revenue. Using technology, a business-to-business company
should be able to add customers and therefore revenue without
adding a lot of employees, hardware, satellite offices and other
overhead.
</P>
<P>
   SPACE: The particular market in which your company is
participating. The word is overused and can mean a vertical market
(see next item) or a type of technology.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta example: AtWork Technologies, an application service
provider to help companies with employee benefits, is in the
``benefits space'' and in the ``ASP space.''
</P>
<P>
   VERTICAL: The ability to go deep in the industry in which your
company is competing.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta example: Edaflow, an Atlanta-based marketplace for the
apparel industry, is going after the apparel vertical.

 &HT;    B to B reshaping how businesses buy and sell
 &HT;    By Ernest Holsendolph
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA - The capacity to comparison shop any product or service
instantaneously and to streamline the flow of those goods is one
advantage the Internet offers businesses _ and may be the one thing
that brings down the cost of doing business faster than anything
else the Web can do.
</P>
<P>
   The nature of buying and selling on the Internet among
businesses is streamlining the flow of goods and services, and
making buyers and sellers smarter.
</P>
<P>
   And a gaggle of Atlanta companies offering to create these
marketplaces is growing fast, business experts say.
</P>
<P>
   Included in the buying and selling in the Internet marketplace
are the purchases by companies for their own housekeeping needs as
well as for the materials they use as a business lifeline _ to make
things or produce services.
</P>
<P>
   Often the exchange is through auctioning, or ``reverse
auctioning,'' where a company will post a request for, say, a
thousand computers and buy from the supplier who offers the best
price.
</P>
<P>
   It is all part of a growing area of business touching nearly
every company of size, and being driven partly by enterprises here
in Atlanta that enable online commerce _ such as hSupply.com,
Manheim Interactive, 1stAG, Idapta, ChannelLink and many others.
</P>
<P>
   Major companies like United Parcel Service, Southwire,
Georgia-Pacific and Cox Enterprises create their own online
channels of business, usually with the help of consultants.
</P>
<P>
   Cox owns Manheim Interactive, the wholesale auto auctioneer,
through its huge Manheim Auction subsidiary. Cox also owns The
Atlanta Journal-Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   ``Creating these online marketplaces is a trend in its infancy
but it is bound to grow fast,'' said Ravi Kalakota, an academic
expert on electronic business and founder of hSupply.com, a
youthful player in the game.
</P>
<P>
   HSupply allows the hospitality industry, such as hotels and
restaurants, to tap into suppliers of consumable items such as
soaps, towels and other items.
</P>
<P>
   ``Online business as a way to put producer or supplier together
with customers is just natural,'' Kalakota said.
</P>
<P>
   The trick is getting it launched, however, said Alan Taetle, an
investment specialist and partner at Noro-Moseley Partners of
Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Among the substantial launch problems, he said, is to get
entrepreneurs to establish a reliable backroom or work processing
capability.
</P>
<P>
   ``Another challenge is to get the starters to assess things like
the power of existing distribution systems that will be the
competition,'' Taetle said, ``and to measure the likelihood that
the market will respond to online buying and selling.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes the transition from traditional sales to online
activity catches on fast, as in the early success of Manheim
Interactive. Manheim Auction has for years been the major operator
of used-car auctions. But the online version has leaped since 1997,
from wholesale volume of $58 million to $615 million last year.
</P>
<P>
   And Hal Logan, president and chief executive of Manheim
Interactive, announced at midyear the company has already surpassed
last year's sales and there's an untapped supply of product that
could continue to propel growth.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've realized there is a whole universe of vehicles sold to
dealers that never touch an auction,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Still Manheim Interactive, though growing fast, is just a slice
of the overall Manheim Auction operation. For instance, cars sold
at Manheim auctions at various physical locations totaled some $38
billion in sales.
</P>
<P>
   Southwire Co. of Carrollton is an example of a company finding
that the Internet is an ideal way to move a segment of its product
line. Southwire makes building wire and cable, utility cable
products, industrial power cable, telecommunications cable, copper
and aluminum rods, and cord products.
</P>
<P>
   Wynn Wise, manager of marketing at Southwire, says the company
has found the Internet handy for selling much of its huge line of
electrical products to contractors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Electrical wholesale distributors buy from 40 percent to 50
percent of our product, some 700 items, and we have found online
selling to be very effective _ and fast growing,'' Wynn said.
</P>
<P>
   The online option offers the buyer many clear advantages, such
as the ability to complete transactions rapidly, get immediate
confirmation of the purchases and delivery, and the ability to deal
at any time, 24 hours a day, seven days a week.
</P>
<P>
   The bigger items produced by Southwire, such as the heavy cable
used by utilities, are not now handled online but through
established contractual relationships, Southwire officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Auctioning is an important segment of online business, industry
people say, but it has its limits.
</P>
<P>
   ``Price is very important in consumer transactions, such as
purchases from Amazon.com, but it is not always that critical in
purchases or procurement by businesses,'' said Michael J.
Mannheimer, vice president for materials management at Cox
Enterprises in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``Other factors such as assured quality, timely delivery, and
consistency are often much more important to major companies,''
said Mannheimer, who is on a national panel of procurement officers
for large corporations.
</P>
<P>
   Mannheimer, who oversees much of the central purchasing for Cox
Enterprises and is online daily as part of his job, says Internet
business transactions are changing the nature of procurement.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not just buying but what we call 'supply chain manage-
</P>
<P>
   ment,''' he said. ``And to some extent the old adversarial
relationship between supplier and buyer is giving way to
partnership, where we work together to build and maintain the flow
of supplies we need.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of all, he said, the Internet is extending the range of
services, not just giving the right prices.
</P>
<P>
   Right around the corner, Mannheimer said, are software and
services that will let big companies permit each employee or
department head to more freely order what they need, within price
ranges and standards pre-set by managers.
</P>
<P>
   Like many other procurement specialists, he said the greatest
blessing of online purchasing is the streamlining of the buying
process, the elimination of forms that get rapidly outdated or lost
and the automation of billing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even as online business grows rapidly,'' Mannheimer said, ``a
bonus is continuous lowering of the cost of individual
transactions, and that is a strong force to lower overhead cost to
businesses.''

 &HT;    Dracula game curdles your blood, but the thrills are over too
quickly
 &HT;    By Yusuf Davis
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Based on characters from Bram Stoker's version of
Dracula, this PC adventure game has a moderately entertaining, and
scary, story line that is made better by intense graphics and a
realistic soundtrack.
</P>
<P>
   Its only shortcoming is the fact that it doesn't take very long
to play, said Jeremy Pace, who reviewed the software.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a pretty cool game,'' said Jeremy. ``I showed it to a
couple of my friends and they thought it was cool, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Set in London in the early 1900s, the game begins seven years
after Jonathan Harker's fiancee, Mina, was bitten by the evil
count.
</P>
<P>
   Now married, Jonathan thinks his wife has recovered from her
encounter with the Prince of Darkness, but he is surprised to find
that the evil is deep within her blood and she has run away to
Transylvania, leaving only a letter.
</P>
<P>
   His mission is to find her before she is reunited with Dracula,
who, as the title suggests, has been resurrected.
</P>
<P>
   The story line, which includes quests and challenges, is good,
but the pictures are what makes this game a winner for the
14-year-old reviewer.
</P>
<P>
   ``The graphics are awesome!'' Jeremy said enthusiastically.
``They're the best I've ever seen.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the vivid scenes and lifelike ugly characters are more
realistic than scenes from a movie.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're so scary-looking, they scared my little sister. My mom
had to tell me to make sure my sister wasn't around when I was
playing it. That's OK with me.''
</P>
<P>
   Jonathan said the program's sounds were nearly as good.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got pretty good speakers, so sometime, when I'd hear some
creaks or a squeaky door opening, I'd have to look around to make
sure nobody else was in the room with me,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   While the game wins points for its visual and audio quality,
it's short on content.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only thing I didn't like about it was that it was too
short,'' Jeremy said. ``I got through all the challenges in a
couple of days. I even started over again, but it wasn't nearly as
good the second time. They must be coming out with an expansion or
a sequel or something. I kind of felt cheated.''

 &HT;    No excuse for not being plugged in
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The smallest violin in the world is now playing for a
New York magazine columnist who recently wrote that he did not have
the time to pay attention to this summer's pop-culture TV
phenomenon ``Survivor.''
</P>
<P>
   His excuse: he was way too busy covering the Democratic National
Convention in Los Angeles and following the events surrounding the
doomed Russian submarine and other stories of import and substance.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, give me a break.
</P>
<P>
   To say something like this _ let alone write it down and publish
it in big magazine _ ought to be pretty embarrassing. Wasn't there
a remote control on the TV set in his Los Angeles hotel room? And
excuse me, but didn't he have a laptop with Internet access to he
could log on to the Web and periodically check the news and
whatever else he wanted to keep up with while he was reporting from
the convention floor?
</P>
<P>
   Even we lowly reporters down here in the boonies of Atlanta have
Internet access when our newspaper sends us out into the world to
cover the news. You'd think the boys from the big city would have
arrived in L.A. loaded down with every piece of electronic gear
from laptops, to cell, phones, wireless pagers and who knows what
else.
</P>
<P>
   But as the political pundits say, all of this is off point. What
we're talking about here is a failure to communicate, or rather a
failure to use communications tools effectively. In a media pundit,
or any kind of pundit for that matter, this is just inexcusable.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, the Democratic Convention was important and there were many
interesting moments, from President Clinton's farewell speech, to
Joe Lieberman's emotional acceptance speech to Vice President Gore,
his wife Tipper and ``that kiss.'' I watched the convention in
prime-time and even if I didn't, CNN, C-Span and even ABC's ``World
News Now'' were running repeats of the proceedings for the people
who missed the convention because they wanted to see who got
bounced off the island or were watching baseball on ESPN.
</P>
<P>
   For the plugged-in crowd, there were any number of Web sites,
running streaming audio and video of the speeches, providing still
photos and text of what was actually said. And if you wanted to see
how this festival of American politics was playing around the
world, who knows how many international Web sites had their own
take on the convention.
</P>
<P>
   Moving on to ``Survivor.'' Yes, perhaps Sue's bitter,
bile-filled farewell tirade doesn't quite rank up there with the
Lincoln's Gettysburg Address or Martin Luther King Jr.'s ``I Have a
Dream'' speech, but you have to admit it was good television. Not
that it matters, but I particularly enjoyed ``it's time for the
snake to eat the rat'' line. It was right up there with Lieberman's
line about the Republican Convention, Tom Hanks and acting. (Need
to catch up with elections goings-on? Try www.alllpolitics.com for
a good overview.)
</P>
<P>
   And you know what? If you didn't see it, there are plenty of
places online to catch up with the show, or at least gain some
passing familiarity with it, now a necessity for any party
conversation.
</P>
<P>
   Yahoo!, for example, had entire sections devoted to both the
convention and ``Survivor'' with links to official sites, excerpts
from speeches, and analysis from the New York Times to almost
everybody with an opinion personal or professional on either story.
(Miss the whole ``Survivor'' phenom? There are a million places to
catch up, start with www.Survivorsucks.com for a quick pop-culture
history lesson.)
</P>
<P>
   Lastly, we cannot forget the Kursk submarine story. The tragedy
of the Russian sailors trapped beneath the bottom of the sea was a
horrifying and continually unfolding drama. The Internet was the
ideal place to follow the daily turn of events, mostly because
unlike the conventions or ``Survivor,'' news was continually
breaking. Sites like CNN, MSNBC, ABCNews.com, the British
Broadcasting Company and even America Online have proven time and
time again that they can grab the breaking news stories, put them
online and have them available for users any time. CNN in
particular had dramatic pictures of the families of the sub victims
waiting for news that was as powerful as anything shown on
television. (Want more sub information? Check out
www.cnn.com/SPECIALS/2000/submarine/) But more importantly it was
there when I wanted it. I didn't have to wait for Headline News to
circle back to the story. I could go to a Web site, and choose the
news I wanted to read.
</P>
<P>
   Today's workers, including serious-minded New York media
pundits, often don't have the time or even the inclination to keep
up with every breaking news story, TV show or political stump
speech. But the news is out there, and there is more than one way
to retrieve it or catch up with news you've missed. You can watch
TV, read newspapers, listen to the radio _ and you can do all three
of those things on the Internet, if you are so inclined. With new
products from Microsoft and additions to the news Web sites, it's
sometimes possible to do all those things online _ and all at the
same time.
</P>
<P>
   Or you just have the headlines downloaded to a phone or a
wireless pager. You can get big gulps from 24-hour cable networks
or tiny sips on a pager. The choice is up to the individual. When
it comes to catching up on the latest news, whether it's Indiana
University coach Bobby Knight's firing, or George W. Bush's
subliminal campaign ads or who won an Emmy last Sunday night, it's
all out there. All anyone has to do is look.

 &HT;    Marvel at the new Spider-Man game
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _
</P>
<P>
   FOR THE CONSOLE
</P>
<P>
   With all the hype surrounding ``superconsoles,'' it's easy to
forget that the original PlayStation is still an amazing machine,
exemplified by the recent launch of Spider-Man ($40; www.activision
.com; for the PlayStation). In it, Spidey scours New York in search
of classic arch-nemeses and the newly created Jade Syndicate thugs.
It's a breathtaking animated translation of the gravity-defying
webhead that holds true to the reluctant-hero theme of the Marvel
Comics mainstay. A fast paced action/adventure, gameplay alternates
between chasing henchmen and fleeing the cops, rescuing the
innocent or battling big bad bosses. There are a couple of
disorienting control issues typical of chase-camera games, but the
perspective is otherwise well balanced between cinematic sweeps to
Spidey's wall-crawling underbelly and wide-angle shots from on
high. Meanwhile, walls, ceilings and other visual impediments will
phase translucent as Spidey skitters about or swings from a web as
only a spider-man can. Offering 3-D imagery, pacing and scope of
comic-book stature, Spider-Man is riddled with story-telling cut
scenes, excellent voice-over dialogue (complete with cheeky Spidey
quips and quotables) plus a rousing musical score. A remarkable
game on any platform, ``super'' or otherwise, Spider-Man is easily
one of the best games ever made for the PlayStation. Tingly yet?
That's just your Spidey senses.
</P>
<P>
   FOR THE DESKTOP
</P>
<P>
   As far as space combat games go, Bang! Gunship Elite ($30;
www.redstorm.com; for Windows) is as gorgeous as they come,
graphically speaking at any rate. Too, it's a very good
introduction to the deep space combat genre in general _ and then
that's it. The Bang! back-story is a blase tale of warmongers
raiding the peace lovers with you the gamer out to save the day.
Actual gameplay merely involves jockeying around, going bang and
making things go boom. Unlike more complex space games of similar
ilk, Bang! Gunship Elite pelts you with incessant and unceasing
droves of enemy war craft causing a de facto mandate to simply
survive any given mission under this constant barrage. Its strength
as a fantastic introduction to state of the art space battle games
is also its weakness; there simply isn't too much to this game
beyond great graphics and unremitting banging.

 &HT;    A more palatable method of learning math
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Like medicine and a spoonful of sugar, computerized
interactive learning seems a much nicer way to shove school down a
reluctant kid's throat. Dorling Kindersley Interactive Learning's I
Love Math ($20; www.dk.com), for example, thinly veils a gaggle of
math-oriented lessons and quizzes (including word-based problems
and shape-based geometry) into a simple but effective point and
click graphic adventure game. Despite a weak background story and
incongruous and hokey dialogue, the innumerable lessons are nicely
displayed and easily interfaced. With some two million arithmetic
questions, 3,000 curriculum-based problems and 250 core math topics
stuffed into six game variants, I Love Math offers a long-term
sugar-coating for those who might otherwise find elementary number
crunching a little hard on the stomach, er _ brain.
</P>
<P>
   A GENTLE BOUNCE FOR YOUR BOUNCING BABE
</P>
<P>
   Fisher Price really seems to shine when it doesn't try too hard.
The Deluxe Soothing Bouncer Seat ($30; www.fisher-price.com) is a
marvel of simple technology. A cute and colorful cloth hammock in a
stalwart but springy wire frame, complete with retractable
sun-screen canopy, is further enhanced by a single-battery motor
that will set the unit to vibrating like a gentle martini maker.
This comforting movement is reportedly ``similar to a ride in the
car,'' albeit one in desperate need of alignment. Regardless, the
Deluxe Soothing Baby Seat is wonderfully efficient, cost effective
and a must-have for any parent wishing the second-best thing to an
old-fashioned, hands-on, comforting cuddle for their wee one.
</P>
<P>
   A SUPER-SENSITIVE WAY TO KEEP TABS ON BABY
</P>
<P>
   Whether your wee one is cackling with glee or grunting with
consternation, cooing over a warm, wet diaper or just crying out
loud, Fisher-Price's Super-Sensitive Nursery Monitor ($33;
www.fisher-price.com) hears it all. While the petite but effective
transmitter requires an AC power source (two DC adapters are
included), the monitor's receiver operates on a single 9-volt
battery (or AC/DC power) making it portable while offering
remarkably clear monitoring whether you're in the yard, the
basement or the garage. Aside from the obvious attribute of
``super'' sensitivity, this monitor bundle includes graciously
sturdy power cords, whereas the external wiring on similar devices
_ including earlier iterations of this very bundle _ are often so
flimsy that one wrong tug can render the contraptions useless.

 &HT;    2001 Grolier encyclopedia gives score of improvements
 &HT;    By Jack Warner
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The Grolier 2001 electronic encyclopedia is out, and
although its new interface is a mixed bag at best, it has so many
improvements that it must get an all-around grade of A.
</P>
<P>
   As its predecessors were, the 2001 edition is focused toward
students through high school age; this is, of course, the nature of
every electronic encyclopedia with the exception of the Britannica.
</P>
<P>
   The Grolier encyclopedia has dozens of research guides on
subjects ranging from subatomic particles to English Romantic
poets.
</P>
<P>
   It also seems to be a very evenhanded work. Its articles on such
hot-button topics as gun control present the basic principles of
both sides equally, along with recent legislative developments.
</P>
<P>
   It is difficult for me to be certain of some anomalies in the
interface, because I am still awaiting a final version of Windows
Millennium to replace the beta version I have been using. Some of
the small problems I've seen _ such as the appearance of symbols
where a dash is intended _ may be related to that.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, it is something short of intuitive. When the
program is booted, it starts in article mode. In this mode, when I
happened upon the entry for Richard Wagner, I was dismayed to find
no indication of any musical examples.
</P>
<P>
   In order to see what musical examples are available, one must be
in All Features mode, with a submode of All Items. Then media
gallery items are displayed in the left-hand list along with
article topics.
</P>
<P>
   Linkages are still somewhat shaky. The entry on John Moses
Browning has a link to the firearms article, but the firearms
article has no link to Browning _ even though it uses one of his
inventions for a clumsy and partially inaccurate animated sequence.
</P>
<P>
   Although there is a research outline on subatomtic particles,
when you type in that topic and click on the article title, you are
told to ``see fundamental particles.'' Fortunately the redirection
is in the form of a link.
</P>
<P>
   It has the obligatory historical timelines, but they seem almost
an afterthought.
</P>
<P>
   The writing for the most part is clear, direct and on a student
level without any hint of condescension, unless one could take this
excerpt from the article on fundamental particles as condescending:
</P>
<P>
   ``The two quarks that make up matter are called the 'up quark'
and the `down quark.' (These names have technical meanings, but the
details are not important here.)''
</P>
<P>
   I would view that arbitrary exclusion as benevolent rather than
snooty. Quarks are difficult enough to grasp as a whole without
being divided into uppers and downers.
</P>
<P>
   The happiest thing to report about the new Grolier, for me at
least, is that it takes its place along with Encarta as the only
electronic encyclopedias to present orchestral music in true
orchestral form, rather than bizarre MIDI interpretations. Nor does
it stint; there are excerpts from all four of Vivaldi's Seasons.
</P>
<P>
   For reasons unknown, the editors decided to stick with MIDI for
keyboard music. This isn't anywhere near as objectionable as
running Beethoven's 6th Symphony through a synthesizer. The sound
is sufficiently close to a piano's that they could have fooled me
except for two things: First, they own up to it, and second, all of
the quicker pieces seem to have been speeded up. Some, like the
third movement of Beethoven's Moonlight Sonata, go beyond all
reason; others, like Liszt's Mephisto Waltz, beyond human
capability.
</P>
<P>
   Despite its peculiarities, this set of two CD-ROMS will be most
useful to any young student. In fact, it's pretty handy for some of
us old ones, too.

 &HT;    Virtual gadgets battle phobias
 &HT;    By Sue Cleere and Jacki Rudd
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _
</P>
<P>
   Dear Sue and Jacki:
</P>
<P>
   I'm interested in virtual gadgets that can be worn like glasses.
I hear they help cure phobias, like fear of spiders or heights.
Could you point me in the right direction?
</P>
<P>
   _ Albert Wiesner, Cleveland, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   Sue: Virtual Reality environments can chase away a fear of
spiders, heights, flying or other anxiety disorders.
</P>
<P>
   Jacki: Believe it or not, VR is more than just fun and games.
The University of Washington, University of Michigan and the
Norwegian University of Science, or NTNU, have all studied using VR
in treating phobias.
</P>
<P>
   Sue: The phobia sufferer wears a virtual reality helmet or
glasses to simulate the phobic environment. For instance, an
arachnophobia subject wears a VR glove. A computer-generated spider
jets across the screen. The idea is to move the VR glove closer to
the spider during their sessions, eventually allowing it to
``crawl'' across the hand.
</P>
<P>
   Jacki: Same with acrophobia (fear of heights). The person's VR
experience will start at the first floor of a building. Eventually
he or she will ``climb'' higher and higher, working through the
anxiety at each floor.
</P>
<P>
   Sue: For more information, you might want to see if Hunter
Hoffman, who specializes in practical applications of VR at the
University of Washington
(www.hitl.washington.edu/people/hunter/index.html.), can point you
in the right direction. His Web page gives phone and e-mail contact
info.
</P>
<P>
   Jacki: Also check out the NTNU's Virtual Reality vs.
Arachnophobia site at www.ntnu.no/gemini/1996-04/4.html or the
University of Michigan's VR findings at
psychinformatics.org/web/UMpsych/staff/mhuang/papers/compare.htm.
</P>
<P>
   Dear Sue and Jacki:
</P>
<P>
   I want to know where to find Office 97. All of the stores I've
contacted said that they only have the 2000 version in stock, that
Office 97 has been sent back to the warehouse. Suggestions?
</P>
<P>
   _ Patricia Alisau, Norcross, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   Sue: I made a few phone calls and ran into the same answer.
Stores have stocked 2000 and are not making earlier versions
available.
</P>
<P>
   Jacki: Fortunately, we can turn to the Web. We found Office 97
at a few sites. Prices range from $150 on up depending on the
platform and whether you need the heftier Pro version.
</P>
<P>
   Sue: You can find the standard version at mediaok.com or
firstsource.com for around $175. I was able to locate a Word/Excel
97 bundle at cdw.com for $320.
</P>
<P>
   Jacki: The Pro version is obviously a little more pricey. I saw
several versions from $300 up to $475. Point your browser to
ePCDeals.com, buypcsoft.com or allbusiness.com.

 &HT;    Reformatting hard disk restores a computer's youthful vigor
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Back in the days when I made a living writing junk
mail advertising, I would have started this column by saying: How
would you like to have a brand new computer without paying a cent?
</P>
<P>
   Even when you remove the breathless hype, today, the offer is
still good. I'll tell you how to make your computer crash less
often and run a lot faster. And you'll spend time, not money, doing
this.
</P>
<P>
   In my junk mail days, the next part would be in tiny type _ we
called it ``mouse type.'' But since I'm not trying to sell you a
Duroc hog, a subscription to the Fruit-of-the-Month Club or a
$29.95 real human hair wig, we will talk in big letters. Here come
the qualifiers:
</P>
<P>
   First, this only makes a difference on computers that have been
around for a while (you'll understand why before we're done).
Second, if you mess up you could end up in line at the computer
repair shop with checkbook in hand. That's why this is a topic I
have been hesitant to touch. But the change in performance can be
so dramatic that I need to tiptoe through it. If you take the time
to understand, it really is quite simple to do.
</P>
<P>
   What I'm talking about is reformatting your hard disk _ erasing
every bit of information and starting fresh. You'll have to
reinstall Windows and all your programs. Before you can start on
this task you'll need a backup copy of all the data you plan to
keep _ every letter, every electronic photograph, your tax return
... everything.
</P>
<P>
   But I can promise you that reformatting the disk will be almost
like making an old computer new. You will notice an increase in
speed and reliability.
</P>
<P>
   To understand why this helps, you need to know what goes on
inside your computer. Imagine that there is this dwarf-sized
bookkeeper who lives in your PC. Every time you add a program, or
delete one, that overworked bookkeeper makes a note of it. Over
time, all these notes and changes can become so complicated that
your computer stutters around trying to find things. It slows down.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes it just throws up its hands and freezes. Even when you
use Windows' built-in ``add/remove software'' program to do your
housekeeping, things can get out of hand.
</P>
<P>
   The only way an average user can clean all this up is to start
fresh every year or so. If you feel at all nervous or confused
about reformatting, find a knowledgeable friend to help, or even
hire someone to do the work for you. Or just don't do it. Even if
you feel confident, get one of those ``Dummies'' books or another
good manual to guide you. I can't cover each step in detail, so
promise me that you'll find that detail yourself.
</P>
<P>
   Step 1. Make sure you have the installation discs for all the
programs you use. You'll need to install them all over again.
</P>
<P>
   Step 2. Find the start-up disk you created when you first
installed Windows or make a new one. Do that by going to the
Control Panel and following the instructions found in ``Add/Remove
Software.''
</P>
<P>
   Step 3. You'll need a backup copy of the data you've created,
including e-mail, word processing documents, tax records,
everything. All this stuff will go away forever when you reformat
the disk. Windows comes with a backup program that will let you
copy all this to floppy disks, zip drives, whatever. The backup
program may not be installed. If it isn't, use your original
Windows disk to install it. Just go to the Control Panel, select
Windows Setup and double click on the System Tools category. Put a
check mark by Backup and follow the directions for installing it.
Then use it.
</P>
<P>
   Step 4. Now comes the scary part. From the Start button, click
Shutdown, then Restart and then OK. Press and hold the CONTROL key
until the startup menu appears. Select Command prompt only and
press Enter. Then type format C: and press Enter. Follow the
instructions you'll see. Don't go to this step unless you are not
only sure you've done everything in Steps 1, 2 and 3 but that you
understand what you've done.
</P>
<P>
   Step 5. Use the start-up disk to restart the computer and then
insert the Windows disc and install it. Make sure you have what is
called the full version of Windows, not just an Upgrade Disc. You
may have to install an earlier version of Windows before you can
install the current version. None of this is any fun at all. But
make sure you understand this step and have the correct discs on
hand.
</P>
<P>
   Step 5. Install your programs.
</P>
<P>
   Step 6. Restore the data from the backups that you made using
the Windows backup program.
</P>
<P>
   You're finally done. Your PC should be working faster now. Both
you and that dwarf of a bookkeeper can breath a sigh of relief.

 &HT;    `Daikatana' shows harm in too much originality
 &HT;    By Vox Day
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Sometimes, when a much-anticipated game takes longer
to develop than expected, the results are worth the wait.
</P>
<P>
   Other times, you simply wonder how on Earth it could have taken
so long to do so little. But ``Daikatana'', the first game from
John Romero's Ion Storm, fits neither of these scenarios. Instead,
its fundamental mediocrity mostly stems from trying to fit too much
into what should have been a simpler game.
</P>
<P>
   One learns from one's mistakes as a game developer, and it's
quite clear that the mistakes in ``Daikatana'' are similar to those
I made in creating a game two years ago which never saw release.
</P>
<P>
   Originality in design is good, but too much of that can kill a
game. ``Daikatana'' is at heart a pure 3D action game, but there
are definite attempts to add role-playing elements, as well as
AI-controlled companion fighters, and a deeper level of
storytelling _ all of this while massively increasing the scope of
the game within the space-time continuum.
</P>
<P>
   The story, which is supposed to be a major element of the game,
turns out to be rather on the weird side, also in the
not-making-sense way. It's the usual save-the-world fare, in this
case revolving around a mysterious and powerful sword that has been
stolen.
</P>
<P>
   The role-playing element is far too weak to even pay any
attention to, especially since it has so little effect on play. The
various environments help keep ``Daikatana'' visually fresh as you
march through its many levels, but the large array of monsters are
not encountered anywhere near as often as you'd expect in an action
game.
</P>
<P>
   The companions are a worthwhile idea, but it's too hard to keep
them alive, considering their relative importance. Also, they're
pretty stupid, so much of your time has to be spent keeping them
from accidentally getting killed.
</P>
<P>
   The graphics are good, although the Nintendo version can be
fairly muddy-looking without the expansion pack that allows for
higher-resolution textures. The action is very perfunctory, in my
opinion, as most combat takes place at relatively long range, but
without much intelligence on the side of the enemies.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, there's just no way around the conclusion that
the current state of gaming has surpassed one of gaming's all-time
great developers. Romero and Carmack may not have the ring of Simon
and Garfunkel or Sigfried and Roy, but there's no doubting the fact
that their solo creations have not had the flair or the creativity
of the games they created together. So here's hoping they will work
together again someday.

DEVICE MERGES CELL, REGULAR PHONES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By PETER J. HOWE   
 c.2000 The Boston Globe   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NORTHBOROUGH, Mass. _ If you're a cellular phone owner whose
love of staying wirelessly connected keeps sloshing into your hours
at home, a little start-up company called Vox2.com has just the
thing for you _ and it's coming right in time for the holiday
season.
</P>
<P>
   It's a classic ``What-took-them-so-long-to-think-this-up?''
device that allows you to connect all of your household phones, or
your home-office phone, to your wireless phone number.
</P>
<P>
   That means you can use the bedroom or kitchen phone to answer a
call coming in over the cell phone, or place an outbound call from
home over your wireless plan during those night and weekend times
when cell calls are free.
</P>
<P>
   Vox2, for now the archetypical 10 guys at card tables on the
second floor of a Route 20 strip mall, expects to have the units
out in November. They'll probably sell for $180 to $200 through
wireless phone companies, office and electronics superstores, and
perhaps yuppie gizmo catalogs such as those from Sharper Image or
Herrington.
</P>
<P>
   The device looks like a charging station, and works like one,
too. By plugging a standard phone line from the base station into a
wall jack, and putting your Nokia or Ericsson phone in the base
(units for other brands are still in the works), every phone in
your house is instantly connected to the wireless service that you
use.
</P>
<P>
   If you want to keep your existing land-line connection at home,
you have to get two-line phones and designate the second (or first)
line as the wireless-based connection.
</P>
<P>
   If you have a business wireless phone that you want to use in a
home office only, you can plug the Vox.Link device into the back of
a two-line desk phone and have it ring only there, instead of in
the rest of the house.
</P>
<P>
   Or, if you are among the growing hundreds of thousands of
Americans who have gone all-wireless for your telecommunications,
you can use your existing one-line home phones as extensions of
your wireless device by cutting the cord with Verizon or your local
carrier and plugging in with Vox.Link.
</P>
<P>
   You could also use the device to replace land-line service at a
summer home where you need phone service only a few weeks a year.
Or you could use it as an alternative to a new Verizon or AT&AMP;T land
line or if gabby teenagers _ or a dial-up, Web-surfing spouse _
have pushed you into the market for a second phone line at home.
</P>
<P>
   The product, being manufactured by Century Electronics in
Marlborough, is kind of a modern-day story like the one about how
Dupont engineers accidentally invented Teflon. Last year, Vox2 was
at work on a complex home networking system for people with
broadband Internet connections. The system suffered the fatal flaw
that you couldn't explain what it did in 30 seconds. Among other
things, it would let you use standard phones to place calls over
the Internet through a computer-based service like Net2Phone.
</P>
<P>
   However, one element of the system _ almost an afterthought _
was the set-up that let you run your home phones off of a wireless
unit.
</P>
<P>
   In a round of trade show schmoozing and meetings with investors,
Vox2 executives found that the wireless link was what turned people
on. In January, ``We came home, and we literally put the rest of
the system in the closet'' and focused on developing the wireless
application as a commercial product, said Ken Holberger, Vox2's
vice president of marketing. He's a former Data General techie who
became a serial entrepreneur in the data-networking world. ``We
picked the best idea from the collection,'' Holberger said.
</P>
<P>
   One problem the system cannot get around: poor wireless
coverage.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we don't do is improve your signal,'' Holberger said. One
trial user who is a Bell South executive, however, has found an
admittedly clumsy way to deal with this by putting the Vox.Link
device in his second-story bedroom, where it gets a strong signal,
and running a phone line to the basement home office, where he
actually takes and places calls on the wireless number.
</P>
<P>
   Here's the trick to the system: If you look at the bottom of a
typical wireless phone, it has a series of little bars that are
roughly analogous to the serial port on a personal computer.
</P>
<P>
   By plugging these bars into the base station, you can connect
other phones to the wireless unit and get it to do things like
translate touch tones from a table phone into a digital packet used
to place a wireless call, or convert the ring of a cell phone into
a distinctive pitched ring on your home phones.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, several inventors have patented roughly similar
systems. Motorola and GTE are among the companies that took a stab
at developing a similar cradle unit or devices to turn a wireless
phone into a cordless phone at home.
</P>
<P>
   But they were all instances of people who were ahead of their
time and stayed that way _ in part because wireless calling rates
were still so high years ago that there was no market for
encouraging people to use their wireless calling plan when their
standard Bell System local service was much cheaper.
</P>
<P>
   The former USWest, now Qwest Communications, and Linx
Communications of Newton have offered for several years a popular
one-number service that rings both your your home or business phone
and your cell phone. It's a different cut at solving the two-phones
problem that doesn't necessarily offer the benefits of arbitraging
your phone use between wired and wireless.
</P>
<P>
   Nowadays, with big local wireless coverage areas and fixed-rate
national roaming plans, you can easily pay less to make what would
be a long-distance or in-state toll call by using your cell phone
instead of your land-line phone _ and pay zero on nights and
weekends if you have a plan when calls then are free.
</P>
<P>
   Adam Zawel, a senior wireless analyst with Yankee Group in
Boston, said that Vox2 is ``a solution that's targeted at a real
problem,'' meaning the hassle of dealing with two different phones.
Zawel said it could accelerate a trend called ``wireline
displacement'' by making it that much more comfortable to use your
wireless as your home phone.
</P>
<P>
   Last autumn, a Yankee Group survey found that 2 percent of US
cell phone owners used them as their sole phone number.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't be surprised if that number has doubled'' when
results of a new poll are reported next month, Zawel said,
reflecting in particular the growing population of supermobile
people in their 20s for whom getting locked into a home phone
number is a waste of time.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond total displacement, Yankee has also found people are
using wireless units for a much bigger share of their total voice
calling, growing from 6 percent to 13 percent between 1998 and
1999. Some wireless companies are looking to encourage this trend
by giving you a discount for calls you make from your home.
</P>
<P>
   One of the biggest challenges Vox2 found in developing the
system was that the dominant wireless phone maker, Nokia, was not
interested in sharing specifications on how its phones work. So
technicians had to spend long hours figuring out what goes on
inside the phone to make it function with the base unit.
</P>
<P>
   Ericsson, however, opened up its documentation to Vox2 to help
it develop a system.
</P>
<P>
   Motorola, which rounds out the Big Three of wireless phone
makers, is being moderately cooperative with Vox2 about developing
a unit for Motorola phones.
</P>
<P>
   Holberger and others at Vox2 are confident they can sell
hundreds of thousands of the units, and have some ideas in mind for
future improvements _ which, understandably, they are staying quiet
about for now, so you won't wait to buy the 2.0 version.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody in the industry we show this to,'' said sales vice
president Michael H. Schwartz, ``says the same thing: `We have been
looking for that for years.' ''

ONLINE, PRIVACY'S A GAMBLE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By STEPHANIE STOUGHTON   
 c.2000 The Boston Globe   
<TEXT>
<P>
   By now, Dani Leto figures Web sites know more about her than she
knows herself.
</P>
<P>
   At first, she didn't mind sharing information, believing
Internet companies could make better recommendations if they were
given insight into her shopping habits. So she has told them what
music, books and software she prefers, as well as her credit-card
numbers, home address and e-mail address.
</P>
<P>
   But two online experiences made Leto uncomfortable with the
notion that Internet companies are taking snapshots of her every
mouse click.
</P>
<P>
   Youknowbest.com, which provides consumer information about
products, accidentally revealed another customer's account
information to her. She learned his name, address and possibly
other information. And nothing more than a typo entered on BMG
Entertainment's music site revealed that the company had been
selling her information to a host of marketers.
</P>
<P>
   At BMGmusicservice.com, she had accidentally written ``Letro.''
``Next thing I knew, I had all this mail in my e-mail box for Dani
Letro,'' said Leto, an account executive in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Like Leto, millions of consumers have invited Internet companies
into their lives, sharing personal details that allow Amazon.com,
SmarterKids.com and other firms to suggest suitable products and
fine-tune their marketing pitches. The practice is known as
``personalization.''
</P>
<P>
   But privacy advocates say consumers should be more concerned
with how their information is used. There is little regulation of
the Internet. And while policymakers debate how to protect
consumers without slowing down the new marketplace or efforts to
offer personalized customer service online, many sites continue to
violate their own privacy policies.
</P>
<P>
   A survey by PricewaterhouseCoopers found that 76 percent of
Internet companies were not in compliance with the privacy
statements made on their Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   Rapidly growing Web businesses often aren't aware of the
breaches, privacy experts say. Others know but don't care.
</P>
<P>
   ``They figure as long as they don't get caught, it's OK,'' said
Larry Ponemon, a PricewaterhouseCoopers partner who specializes in
privacy issues.
</P>
<P>
   Reading the fine print helps, too.
</P>
<P>
   BMGmusicservice.com, for example, said it will occasionally
provide e-mail and postal addresses to selected companies _ though
shopper Leto complained that the policy is tucked away in the
company's Web site.
</P>
<P>
   Youknowbest.com has a more stringent privacy statement, though
the policy had little to do with Leto's experience. Leto managed to
access another customer's information during a test of the site
because both consumers had used the same network password. The
problem has been fixed, a company official said.
</P>
<P>
   In some cases, Internet companies that hoped to avoid scrutiny
have found themselves wrestling with regulators.
</P>
<P>
   Living.com, a online furniture retailer that recently filed for
bankrtupcy protection, received a stern warning from Texas Attorney
General John Cornyn. If the company sells customer data, Cornyn
said, it risks violating state laws.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Trade Commission has stepped into the privacy
debate, too. The agency now is charged with protecting the privacy
of youths under age 13, under the Children's Online Privacy
Protection Act of 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The FTC also filed suit against Toysmart.com, an Internet toy
seller based in Waltham, Mass., after the company collapsed in May
and tried to auction off its customer database.
</P>
<P>
   On its Web site, Toysmart.com had promised never to sell
personal information, which included customers' shopping
preferences and children's birth dates.
</P>
<P>
   Both state and federal regulators have been watching DoubleClick
Inc., which tracks Internet users on an anonymous basis to help
companies target their marketing.
</P>
<P>
   DoubleClick ignited controversy when it announced plans to merge
its anonymous information with personally identifiable consumer
data collected by off-line companies that are members of Abacus
Direct.
</P>
<P>
   Some Internet companies argue that consumers should be more
worried about a cyber-world in which there is no personalized
marketing.
</P>
<P>
   They point to catalog retailers and other off-line companies
that have long swapped and sold lists of suitable shoppers, in
effect decreasing the number of mass mailings. Imagine what would
happen to your mailbox before the holiday season if companies could
only guess what you liked, they say.
</P>
<P>
   Web retailers also argue that their personalization efforts make
them better merchants. And the more information that you provide,
they say, the better they can serve you.
</P>
<P>
   Citigroup Inc. and other companies, for instance, can offer
personalized financial Web sites that combine large quantities of
sensitive information, including a person's assets, net worth, and
airline mileage awards.
</P>
<P>
   Travel sites _ Travelocity.com and Expedia.com are two examples
_ say that they can help you find bargains on air fares, car
rentals, and hotels if you tell them where you like to vacation.
CDnow.com will suggest Ella Fitzgerald or Louis Armstrong if it
knows you like jazz.
</P>
<P>
   At SmarterKids.com, parents can build profiles by entering their
children's ages, educational levels, and interests. The Needham,
Mass. online retailer uses that information to suggest appropriate
educational toys and games.
</P>
<P>
   Parents also can get extensive information on how their infants
should be developing and what their children should be learning at
various grade levels. The site then offers various test-preparation
tools.
</P>
<P>
   Customer profiles also help SmarterKids.com turn more repeat
buyers into loyal shoppers. A frequent buyer, for example, receives
marketing pitches. On the other hand, those consumers who return
items or seek only marked-down merchandise might find themselves
deleted from the company's marketing list.
</P>
<P>
   Amazon.com _ with more than 23 million customers, it's the Web's
largest retailer _ has become one of the leaders in
personalization. Watch the bottom left corner as you click on
items. As you browse, Amazon.com begins updating that space to
reflect your preferences.
</P>
<P>
   Amazon.com shoppers can receive recommendations based on what
they like, what their friends like, what their colleagues like, and
even what people in Boston like (``All Souls: A Family Story From
Southie'' in books, ``The Usual Suspects'' in video).
</P>
<P>
   But such extensive feedback comes only if customers open up _
which they do.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have all these customers who are passionable about sharing
information about the things they love or don't like,'' said J.J.
Jacobi, Amazon.com's director of community.
</P>
<P>
   Although many consumers readily hand over details of their
lives, regulators and policy makers say the need for stronger
enforcement of online privacy will grow as more Web sites begin to
collect and analyze consumer data.
</P>
<P>
   More than 60 bills now in Congress would address online privacy.
The FTC is backing legislation that would force Internet companies
to tell consumers whether their information is being collected, how
it will be used, and what kind of security measures will protect
their data from prying eyes. Web sites also would have to include
an opt-in provision, meaning consumers would have to grant
permission before their personal data could be collected.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet industry is preparing its own solution. The World
Wide Web Consortium has been planning a system that would allow
Internet users to define the information they are willing to share.
When a Web site does not meet the Internet surfer's standards, a
warning would appear on the screen.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of this debate is healthy,'' said Matt Cutler, cofounder
of NetGenesis, a Cambridge, Mass. maker of software that helps Web
sites analyze visitors' behavior. ``There will be a period of
adjustment to decide what is appropriate and what is not
appropriate.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials at Amazon.com apparently decided that what they were
doing did not pass the test.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, the Seattle-based online retailer revamped its
privacy statement, spelling out exactly how it has used _ and could
use _ customer data. The Web giant now says it will pass along
customer data if it is sold to another company. It also
acknowledged that it has been sending e-mail marketing pitches on
behalf of other companies.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said the company's actions were designed to prevent
future controversy over its privacy policy, which had been
criticized as vague.
</P>
<P>
   Whether many customers really stop to peruse privacy policies is
another question. Ponemon, of PricewaterhouseCoopers, estimated
that 2 to 3 percent of consumers read privacy statements.
</P>
<P>
   But he doesn't blame the busy consumer. Internet companies often
bury their privacy statements on their Web pages. And even if
customers find the policies, they often must read pages and pages
of confusing text written by lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   ``What (Web sites) don't realize,'' Ponemon said, ``is that some
of these policies say, `We don't respect your privacy. Don't trust
us.' ''

WEB CONSULTANTS FEEL DOT-COM PINCH 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By STEPHANIE STOUGHTON   
 c.2000 The Boston Globe   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Internet consultants delighted Wall Street investors when their
stock prices soared and customers lined up at their front doors,
anxious to build vibrant Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   But the surge couldn't last forever.
</P>
<P>
   And earlier this month, the dot-com turmoil that began when
investors began spurning virtual retailers spilled over to the
technology consultants that helped create the new marketplace.
</P>
<P>
   Triggered by Viant Corp.'s warning that its third-quarter
earnings would fall short of expectations, the stock prices of
consultants like Scient Corp., Breakaway Solutions Inc., and
Sapient Corp. spiraled downward.
</P>
<P>
   Also feeling the pinch is Cambridge Technology Partners Inc.,
which said that bad debts from dot-coms and other problems
contributed to a larger-than-expected loss in the second quarter,
ended June 30.
</P>
<P>
   The downturn has been blamed on dot-com companies that are
backing out of projects and, in some cases, failing to pay their
bills.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Fortune 1000 companies no longer feel the
pressure to race to the Web, now that their virtual rivals are
struggling.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts are becoming more conservative. Mark D'Annolfo, a
Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown analyst in Boston, recently whittled his
``strong-buy'' recommendation list of consultants to Scient,
Sapient, Proxicom Inc., and Diamond Technology Partners Inc.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're undergoing a transition where the dot-com mania has
really exited the market,'' D'Annolfo said.
</P>
<P>
   Some accepted more dot-com business
</P>
<P>
   In the last year, money-losing Internet firms have been spurned
by investors, suppliers, landlords, advertisers, and even
landlords. The skeptics asked for cash upfront.
</P>
<P>
   Wary consultants have also kept dot-coms at arm's length _
though some exercised more caution than others.
</P>
<P>
   Most consultants receive less than 5 percent of their revenue
from Internet upstarts, according to a report by SG Cowen
Securities analyst Moshe Katri.
</P>
<P>
   Particularly choosy is Proxicom, a Reston, Va., technology
consultant that takes in less than 2 percent of its sales from
dot-coms.
</P>
<P>
   Sapient, on the other hand, gets 15 percent of sales from
dot-coms, and Viant, between 15 percent and 25 percent.
</P>
<P>
   A Sapient spokeswoman said the Cambridge company already
carefully screens dot-com customers but would not say whether
executives planned stricter policies.
</P>
<P>
   But Viant officials, who watched their stock price plummet to
record levels, may soon tinker with their dot-com selection and
payment policies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly, with the market changes, we're going to take an even
more conservative approach than we have in the past,'' said Tara
Knowles, chief marketing officer of Boston-based Viant. ``The bar
to entry is going to get much higher.''
</P>
<P>
   Analysts predict a wave of consolidation
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts predict Wall Street's backlash against technology
consultants will be followed by a wave of consolidation in the
industry.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of small players that have sprouted up in Boston and
other high-tech markets, relying on revenue from dot-coms, may soon
drop out of the race, they said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The leaders are being supported and may expand over time,''
said Eric Ross, an analyst with Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette in
Boston. ``The also-rans and the me-too's are being neglected.''
</P>
<P>
   But several consultants downplayed Wall Street's reaction,
saying the financial markets were only taking a more realistic turn
after sending their stocks on a roller-coaster ride for two years.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel that the market is just sort of getting back to normal
after the rushes of last year and this year,'' said Ingrid Ekstrom,
a Sapient spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   ``So it's just sort of steadying out now.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, analysts expect stronger consultants skilled in
integrating software systems will continue to attract large
corporations as customers.
</P>
<P>
   These projects will be more expensive and complex, thought they
will take more time, they said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The budget and sales cycles will look a lot different than
those for a dot-com,'' said Christine Overby, an analyst with
Forrester Research in Cambridge, Mass.

GOVERNMENT LABS SEE THEIR BEST MINDS LURED BY STARTUPS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By KATIE HAFNER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Throughout the high-tech era, government research laboratories
have been seedbeds for some of the most important advances in
computing, robotics, gene sequencing, nuclear-weapons detection and
other fields. And for engineers and computer scientists, the labs
have been havens of job permanence.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the technology boom in Silicon Valley and across the nation
has changed all that. The lure of the private sector and its many
startups is so strong that national research labs are losing their
best and brightest in growing numbers.
</P>
<P>
   Senior scientists making $90,000 at a government lab can go to
private companies and see their salaries rise by 50 percent. Add a
lucrative stock-option package and the appeal can be irresistible.
</P>
<P>
   Financial rewards are not the only factor. At Los Alamos
National Laboratory in New Mexico, the case of Wen Ho Lee, the
scientist accused of mishandling nuclear secrets, has also had an
effect.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to wake up and think I had the best job in the world,''
said Pete Beckman, a 36-year-old computer scientist who spent four
years at Los Alamos before leaving in April. ``It was so much fun
and I was working with absolutely the smartest people in the world.
I didn't mind making 30 percent less than if I were at a private
company. But you can only put up with so much.''
</P>
<P>
   He took a job in the Santa Fe area for TurboLinux, a software
company, for what he called a substantial pay increase _ he made
$100,000 at Los Alamos _ and stock options. Four others from Los
Alamos left at the same time to join him.
</P>
<P>
   Many administrators fear that as a result of such departures,
government-sponsored technical and scientific research, some of it
affecting national security, could erode over the next several
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the attrition continues to escalate, at some point you get
behind the power curve, no matter what you do,'' said David
Pehrson, deputy head of engineering at Lawrence Livermore National
Laboratory in Livermore, Calif. ``You ultimately weaken the ability
of the lab to do the things we're asked to do.''
</P>
<P>
   The annual attrition rate at leading research centers like Los
Alamos, Lawrence Livermore and Sandia has traditionally been around
4 percent. Recently, it has risen into the double digits _
especially in the fields of supercomputing and biotechnology, where
expertise is in high demand. That is still less than the turnover
in private industry, typically close to 25 percent, but that fact
is of little comfort to the government.
</P>
<P>
   Attrition at Los Alamos' Computing, Information and
Communications Division rose from 6 percent in 1998 to 14 percent
in the spring of 2000. At the lab's Advanced Computing Laboratory,
14 of 34 full-time employees, or 41 percent, have left or are
preparing to leave. In some of Sandia's computing groups, the
attrition rate has risen to 11 percent, and in some parts of
Lawrence Livermore it is as high as 14 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The departures have not only caused the customary disruptions
that occur when an employee leaves, but have also affected work
related to national security. Beckman and his colleagues had been
working on advanced software for simulating nuclear weapons
testing.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, a group of six scientists at Sandia in California,
who had invented a technology for the development of hand-held
sensors used to detect chemical and biological agents, left earlier
this year to start a new company, called Eksigent, based on their
invention.
</P>
<P>
   Dave Rakestraw, 39, who had been at Sandia for 12 years and is
one of the co-founders of Eksigent, said the Wen Ho Lee episode had
had a spill-over effect at Sandia and other labs. In general,
however, Rakestraw pointed to a decline in the overall
attractiveness of working at Sandia.
</P>
<P>
   ``The environment in the lab is not as desirable as it used to
be,'' he said. ``In olden days, very large sums of money were
poured into national labs, which gave really smart scientists an
environment where they could be the best they could be. Now
competition for resources has been much more a part of everyone's
lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Further, Rakestraw said, ``there's always the lure of winning
the lottery by joining some startup and you get much richer than
you ever imagined.''
</P>
<P>
   In northern California, the gradual encroachment of Silicon
Valley into less congested cities has compounded the situation.
Livermore, 40 miles southeast of San Francisco, used to be
considered the far outskirts of Silicon Valley. But in the last
year or so, a number of high-tech companies have arrived in the
area. As a result, housing prices have soared.
</P>
<P>
   And the problem is not confined to national security labs. NASA
Ames Research Center at Moffett Field, Calif., in the heart of
Silicon Valley, has been particularly vulnerable to recruitment
from the computer industry. In recent years, NASA Ames has lost
several high-level engineers who have gone to work for a variety of
startups and become millionaires in the process.
</P>
<P>
   The labs are beginning to fight back, taking measures to keep
people from leaving and make themselves more appealing to new
recruits. Sandia, Lawrence Livermore and NASA Ames now offer
signing bonuses, and Los Alamos is likely to do so. Sandia's
California division is also considering providing housing
assistance.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists like Rakestraw and Beckman said they were torn about
leaving their government work, partly because of the sense of civic
duty they felt as lab employees. ``A lot of us felt a lot of pride
working at the lab, focused on protecting the country and
developing the next generation of technology,'' Beckman said.
</P>
<P>
   That sense of loyalty has prompted some to seek a way to keep a
foot in both worlds. Ronald Reisman, 46, an engineer at NASA Ames,
has been working for 12 years on improving the nation's ailing air
traffic control system. But as a government employee, Reisman was
making far less than he could at a private company. So dedicated
was Reisman to his work that when he finally agreed to take a
high-paying job at an e-commerce software firm recently, he
insisted that he be allowed to continue to work at NASA part-time
until he finished his project.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been a civil servant for a dozen years and I'm not going
to throw it away for a few scheckels'' Reisman said. ``There's
honor involved.''

GETTING ON THIS PARTY LIST TAKES CREDENTIALS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By ALEX PHAM   
 c.2000 The Boston Globe   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ In an area with more schmoozers and networkers
per square inch than anywhere else on the planet, Monica Lee is
Silicon Valley's ultimate matchmaker.
</P>
<P>
   Her ``Wild Card Wednesday'' parties and events have led to jobs,
business deals, romances _ even a marriage.
</P>
<P>
   Not bad for a self-described geek from Harvard University and
the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Lee put on her monthly soiree for the Silicon Valley
``Swing Set'' _ so called not for their dating habits, but for
swinging from one start-up to another. These are young
professionals, 25 to 35 years old, most of whom have master's
degrees in business administration and advanced engineering
degrees.
</P>
<P>
   Lee began Wild Card Wednesdays six years ago, as an informal
gathering at a bar in Palo Alto, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had just started a job as a venture capitalist, and I wanted
to celebrate my first investment,'' said Lee, 32. ``So three of us
went to a bar. Because it was a Wednesday, we wondered who the heck
would be out drinking in Palo Alto in the middle of the week.'' Lee
remembered warning her drinking buddies beforehand that ``It'll be
a total wild card!''
</P>
<P>
   Since those humble beginnings, the organization has exploded. It
has a mailing list with more than 4,000 people linked to a
full-blown job network and bonded by events that include
sky-diving, snowboarding, hang gliding, diving for abalone,
heli-skiing, surfing (the ocean, not the Web), and cocktail parties
at ``emerging'' San Francisco nightclubs.
</P>
<P>
   With a playlist like that, it's not surprising that getting on
the Wild Card mailing list can be tougher than getting admitted to
MIT. Lee declined to describe any criteria; members are referred by
the creme de la few and added to list because of a certain je ne
sais quoi.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the qualifications, it was hardly a snooty crowd
Wednesday at the Bas Bar and Nightclub. But because of the Formula
One car-racing theme, the ``hunk ratio'' was higher than normal,
said Susan Doherty, a volunteer cohost.
</P>
<P>
   The party's theme might as well have been ``All Roads Lead to
Massachusetts.''
</P>
<P>
   Doherty met Lee in a study group when both were undergraduates
at Harvard. She started dating her now-husband, a chemical engineer
from MIT, at a Wild Card event in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Another cohost, Sashi Sabaratnam, met her boyfriend, a former
biochemist at Brandeis University, at a Wild Card party. Through
other connections at Wild Card, she also found her current job with
SquareTrade, a San Francisco company founded by three Harvard
Business School graduates.
</P>
<P>
   Alexandra Chinoporos, a Boston native who worked for Lotus
Development Corp. and moved to the Bay Area two years ago, finds
the New England connections at Wild Card functions comforting.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know every month I can come and see familiar faces,'' said
Chinoporos, who is now with Escalate, a Silicon Valley start-up
that helps retailers set up online shops.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is such a well-beaten path between Boston and Silicon
Valley that there are just a lot of random coincidences involving
Boston,'' said Neal Day, chief technology officer of Wal-Mart.com.
A Weston native, he was the Wild Card cohost.
</P>
<P>
   With such strong ties, Lee is contemplating starting a Wild Card
chapter in other technology hubs such as Atlanta, London, Boston,
New York, and Seattle. But for Lee, it's not just about sun and
fun. She also plans to start a venture fund linked to Wild Card
events and members. Last year, the events began to take on sponsors
that pay several thousand dollars to host an event. And while
posting jobs is free, it's not likely to stay that way.
</P>
<P>
   In a market obsessed with recruiting workers, Lee knows that
access to members of Wild Card, technology professionals with MBAs,
can be valuable.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's face it, what's the hardest thing about starting a
company?'' Lee asked rhetorically. ``It's finding the right people.
We can help facilitate that.''
</P>
<P>
   Vision Inc., a sponsor of last week's event, paid less than
$10,000 for the privilege, money that Vision executives believe was
well spent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wild Card has a reputation for having decision makers at their
events,'' said Michael Blum, director of business development for
Vision. ``It's not just a job fair. You can actually go and close
business at these events.''

   GOVERNMENT SITES LAGGING, SURVEY SAYS
</P>
<P>
   Most government Web sites do not offer search capabilities,
technical help or citizen services, like the ability to register a
vehicle online, according to an analysis by researchers at Brown
University. The study of 1,813 state and federal government Web
sites concluded that government at all levels was not making full
and effective use of commonly available information technology.
Specifically, the survey found that 78 percent of the sites
surveyed offered no online services, only 15 percent allowed some
form of disability access and just 4 percent had foreign-language
translation features. The survey, completed at Brown's Taubman
Center for Public Policy and American Institutions, found that the
largest states had the most comprehensive presence online.

</P>
<P>
   Shares of Allaire, which makes software that lets companies
tailor Web site content for electronic commerce, fell sharply
Monday after the company said sales of its core product would fall
far short of expectations. For the third quarter ending Sept. 30,
the company now expects revenue of $28 million to $32 million,
compared with $33.3 million in the second quarter and $15.1 million
in the third quarter of last year. The company expects a net loss
of 5 cents to 20 cents a share in the third quarter, in contrast to
net income of 6 cents a share in the second quarter and a net loss
of a penny a share in the third quarter of 1999. Analysts surveyed
by First Call/Thomson Financial had predicted earnings of 7 cents a
share for the third quarter. Allaire's stock closed down $7.06, or
40 percent, to $10.44, just off its 52-week low and well off the
52-week high of $94.12 it reached in March.

   JUNIPER AIMING ANEW AT CISCO
</P>
<P>
   Juniper Networks, a leader in Internet switching technology,
intends to announce a new line of products Tuesday, mainly routing
switches that are smaller, less costly and more efficient than its
previous models. In doing so, Juniper will expand its rivalry with
Cisco Systems. Juniper has made its name by developing routers for
the core of Internet networks that can handle flows of up to 10
billion digital bits a second. Cisco's fastest commercially
available routers can handle flows of only 2.5 billion bits a
second. Still, Cisco has remained the dominant provider of Internet
switches that connect to paying customers rather than only to other
big switches at a network's heart. Juniper's two new Internet
switches are aimed squarely at that market.
</P>
<P>
   DIGITAL
</P>
<P>
   NEW WIRELESS SERVICE PLANNED
</P>
<P>
   ScreamingMedia, a company that gathers content like news stories
and photos and filters it into client Web sites, is expected to
announce plans Tuesday to provide wireless services for its network
of about 2,800 content providers and 1,100 subscribers. In a deal
with OracleMobile, a wireless Internet subsidiary of the Oracle
Corp., a software company, ScreamingMedia will develop and operate
wireless services for media companies.
</P>
<P>
   NET2PHONE FORMS VENTURE WITH CISCO
</P>
<P>
   Net2Phone is branching out beyond its core business of providing
low-cost voice and data calls over the Internet in forming a
software venture with Cisco Systems. The new company, called Adir
Technologies, will sell software to communications companies
seeking to route calling traffic over the Internet. With the
venture, in which Cisco has a minority stake, Net2Phone hopes to
receive revenue from software licensing fees. The diversification
of Net2Phone's activities is an effort to make the company, which
is based in Newark, less vulnerable to the fierce competition
gripping the Internet telephony industry.

 &HT;    First meeting of shirttail kin sparks memories of Grampa
 &HT;    By Gary Borders
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NACOGDOCHES, Texas _ My grandfather died five years ago this
month. I didn't realize it had been that long until I had a
birthday party a few weeks back, and one of my wife's cousins
brought a shirttail relative of mine to the bash _ someone I had
never met but who knew my grandfather. Turns out he's kin to my
grandfather's last wife, so he's not really a blood relative, but
in East Texas the connection is close enough that I called him
``cuz'' the rest of the evening.
</P>
<P>
   I guess it was having to explain his extensive marital past to
my new step-cousin that brought Grampa to mind. Both Grandpa and I
said ``I do'' three times, with the key difference being he
outlived his wives, and my exes most definitely still live in
Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently every other generation, Borders men end up with
several spouses. My great-great-grandfather was married five times
to four different women, and he's buried in Kentucky with two
planted on either side of him. True story. His name was Buck, and I
hope I meet up with him in the hereafter. Sounds like he was a
cutter.
</P>
<P>
   Grampa gave me plenty of advice; he was free with that, and, of
course, I didn't pay attention to much of it. Once when I was
thinking about seeking my fortune in a big city, he said it was far
better to be a big fish in a small pond. I don't about the big fish
part, but I definitely prefer small ponds and knowing most
everybody you meet in business and social circles. In small towns,
people get used to your ways, and you get used to theirs.
</P>
<P>
   Grampa was a chamber-of-commerce, Rotarian, white-shoed,
white-belted, Baptist Republican. Not likely it would cause him no
small amount of amusement to know his once wild-haired, left-wing
grandson is finishing a term as chamber chairman and hasn't missed
a Rotary meeting in three years. I would be compelled in defense of
my checkered past to point out I still have never voted for a
Republican for president, will never wear a white belt, and hang
with the Methodists these days, figuring it's sort of a liberal
branch of the Catholicism in which I was raised. He would point out
with a cackle that I was losing my hair quite nicely. I used to
give him unshirted heck about being bald as a cueball from about
age 30 on.
</P>
<P>
   I still run across people who knew my grandfather throughout
East Texas, who remember his stint as a professional Boy Scout
running Camp Pirtle up near Carthage or his post-retirement job as
a gladhander for the East Texas Chamber of Commerce. There are a
slew of middle-aged folks who fondly recall him from Pirtle, where
I spent some happy times riding as he drove the ancient Willys Jeep
the camp owned from one campsite to another. That's partially why I
bought a Jeep a few months back _ what's called around here a
``Jeep Jeep'' to distinguish it from the more luxurious Cherokee.
It's certainly an improvement over the 1950s model we bounced
around in on those red-dirt roads near Lake Murvaul, but not by
much. I wish I could have taken him for a ride in my Jeep down some
rutted, dusty backroads.
</P>
<P>
   My grandfather lived a long, full life, dying at 88 from
prostate cancer that had been diagnosed and beaten back many years
before. Not long before he died, I went to visit, and he
matter-of-factly told me he wasn't going to make it to 89.
</P>
<P>
   I didn't argue with him. He knew he had played out his string,
and it had been a long one, from being a cowboy in Wyoming, to a
police chief who shot and killed a man once and didn't like to talk
about it, to a genial insurance salesman and then professional Boy
Scout. Last time I saw him, he was lying on the bed, weak and
exhausted. He squeezed my hand and turned to the wall. He didn't
want us to see him this way, the man who often boasted he could
whip a wagonload of wildcats. I took the hint and didn't come back
until the funeral.
</P>
<P>
   His last wife, Lorraine Borders from Gilmer, Texas, is still
alive and well, now pushing 90 herself. I attended their wedding
more than 30 years ago _ a relatively rare event in the 1960s,
going to your grandfather's wedding. He married well each time, and
I'm glad to have met one of her kinfolk, now hanging out with one
of my wife's relatives.
</P>
<P>
   It's a small world. That's the way my grandfather liked it.

 &HT;    Bush campaign reeling from one misstep after another
 &HT;    By Ernest Murray
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LUFKIN, Texas _ Gov. George W. Bush must surely be wondering
where he took the wrong turn on the road to the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Blunder after embarrassing blunder has Bush _ at one time the
unequivocal frontrunner _ now playing catch-up with the Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   September has been a particularly cruel month.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month at a rally Bush made an aside comment to his
vice presidential running mate Dick Cheney in graphic language what
he thought of a particular New York Times reporter. Unfortunately
for him, Bush was wearing a live microphone hooked to the public
address system. The comment made all the news shows, was opined on
editorial pages across the country and made Bush the butt of many a
joke on late night talk shows.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has also been taking it on the chin for his ``debate on
debates.'' Democratic presidential candidate Al Gore is a seasoned
debater and Bush has been stalling in hopes that Gore's camp will
compromise on a debate forum that eases any worries in the
Republican circle that their candidate may come off looking less
than presidential.
</P>
<P>
   The latest stumble involves an anti-Gore Republican National
Committee commercial that for a split second flashes the word
``rats'' across the screen. Not until it is viewed in slow motion
can the word be clearly seen.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, of course, categorically denies any involvement with the
commercial and says it is obviously a glitch that somehow didn't
make it to the cutting room floor.
</P>
<P>
   But it's a tried-and-true device called subliminal messaging
that has been around for years. Soft drink companies have been
known to slip their brand names into films in hopes movie goers
will suddenly get a hankering for a cola.
</P>
<P>
   Whether Bush knew or didn't know about the ``R'' word is
unimportant. Conventional wisdom is he didn't know. The problem is
that these incidents by themselves mean little, but together, this
growing body of bloopers is undermining the Republican juggernaut
big time.
</P>
<P>
   As a CNN anchor noted, ``No detail is too small or too fleeting
to cause a controversy.''
</P>
<P>
   Every minute Bush spends explaining campaign missteps is time
that otherwise could be used to get his message out.
</P>
<P>
   It's too soon to begin the death watch on the Bush campaign, but
any more slipups could be the deciding factor among that all
important five percent of the voters who haven't made up their mind
yet.

 &HT;    Don't count out Bush
 &HT;    By Arnold Garcia
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Don't count Bush out.
</P>
<P>
   Political memories are notoriously short, a Republican friend
reminded me during a conversation about Texas Gov. George W. Bush's
current situation.
</P>
<P>
   After the primaries, experienced politicos never expected the
race to be anything other than close. But then Bush caught a good
bounce after the Republican convention in Philadelphia and suddenly
was portrayed as inevitable in the national press. These days, we
read stories about how badly the campaign is stumbling.
</P>
<P>
   Well, there is certainly a rough patch, but I wouldn't call the
undertaker just yet. From the beginning, the governor was running
against prosperity _ always a popular incumbent.
</P>
<P>
   And though he has been a popular governor in Texas, Texans don't
really play well in the rest of the country, despite our natural
charm. And, to be perfectly candid, the state's socially
parsimonious Legislature opened the doors to loads of questions
about the delivery of human services. Our juries and judges are
notorious for severe punishments and our posture on environmental
issues is like our air: hazy.
</P>
<P>
   But you can say the same thing about California, which curiously
has an image of being hip and progressive. Texans, on the other
hand, are viewed as backward, crude Luddites. Here in Texas,
however, we didn't vote to deny hapless immigrants social services
and education like Californians did. The Golden State hires better
publicists.
</P>
<P>
   So, the presumption was always that the governor was going to
take some hard knocks and that it was going to be a close race.
</P>
<P>
   Well, guess what? That's exactly the way the campaign has
unfolded. It shouldn't be a surprise, but there's an awful lot of
that being expressed out there. Maybe it was the post convention
bounce that shortened that memory. Could have been any number of
things, but we're back to where it started _ staring at a close
contest that is to be decided in October, now just over a week and
the Olympics away.
</P>
<P>
   Another friend suggested that people are starting to focus on
issues and the governor hasn't done a good job of identifying and
pushing his. Bush went on the offensive last week on the state of
the national parks system. While it is true that the national parks
are in sad shape, the same can be said for the parks in Texas,
making that choice of an issue a curious one.
</P>
<P>
   When yet more questions arose recently about Gore fund-raising
techniques, Bush tried to capitalize on it, but the national media
was more enthralled with the governor's seeming capitulation on the
debate issue.
</P>
<P>
   This guy can't seem to buy a break.
</P>
<P>
   Next month's debates undoubtedly will play a major role in
shaping the outcome. And all Bush has to do is show up and break
even _ or close to it _ to be declared the real winner.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, he paid a price for balking at participating in the
debates organized by the national commission, but he's committed
now. And no one expects anything except an Al Gore win.
</P>
<P>
   So, Bush's job will be similar to the groom's mother at a
wedding: Wear beige and speak only when spoken to. Everything
should be all right then. The expectations for Bush are so low that
Gore might even come off poorly if he presses too aggressively. And
if Bush manages to land a good punch or two, it will make him look
like the greatest debater since Henry Clay.
</P>
<P>
   Man, I'd love to play a poker hand with those odds.

 &HT;    Buick strikes gold with Tiger Woods endorsement
 &HT;    By Linda Sharp
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Using celebrities to draw attention to their products
is nothing new in the automotive industry.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1950s, Dinah Shore was singing the praises of seeing the
U.S.A. in a Chevrolet. A Chrysler Cordoba will forever be linked to
Ricardo Montalban and Corinthian leather, and everybody knows that
Newnan country music star Alan Jackson is ``crazy 'bout a Ford
truck.''
</P>
<P>
   But an endorsement can do more than draw attention. It can
change an image.
</P>
<P>
   For a long time, Buick has been a sponsor of the PGA and the
professional golf tour. Now Buick has linked itself to the hottest
commodity in golf and perhaps in all of American marketing: Tiger
Woods.
</P>
<P>
   It is no secret that Buicks have been thought of as cars
primarily for the older set. How quickly we have forgotten the fury
of the potent Wildcats of the '50s and '60s or the fire-breathing
Regal Grand Nationals. I think General Motors did the Buick brand a
great disservice when it yanked it from NASCAR competition. Names
like Bobby Allison and Harry Gant not only helped to win on Sunday
and then sell on Monday, but also generated pride among Buick
drivers.
</P>
<P>
   Back to Tiger. If you have any doubts about his drawing power,
I'd like to share a personal experience. When Woods was playing in
his first Masters competition, my husband and I had stopped that
afternoon in a Memphis barbecue establishment.
</P>
<P>
   A Los Angeles Lakers basketball game was playing on the
television. Shortly, two teenagers came in. They asked the
proprietor if they could change the channel to watch the Masters.
This young man has clout, not only in the golf community but also
among a young and diverse cross section of America.
</P>
<P>
   And why shouldn't he? He is a marketer's dream _ young,
clean-cut, articulate and exceptionally talented.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, Buick is running an ad campaign that links Tiger to
the Olympics _ well, sort of. We all know that golf is not an
Olympic sport, but Woods takes the ``gold'' _ a gold-colored Buick,
that is _ when he hits a ball farther than a discus and into the
bull's-eye of the archery target.
</P>
<P>
   Buick likewise has won the gold with Tiger Woods.

 &HT;    First injectors needed improvement
 &HT;    By Nora Carter
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _
</P>
<P>
   Q: I am the original owner of a 1990 Camaro with the
six-cylinder engine and less than 80,000 miles on it. It has had
only one tune-up yet still passes the emissions test with flying
colors. The garage I use suggests I have a cleaning solution run
through my fuel injectors. However, my owner's manual tells me that
the fuel injectors are self-cleaning and could be ruined by having
them cleaned.
</P>
<P>
   My questions to both mechanics and factory reps about the
workings or this ``self-cleaning system'' have yet to be answered.
</P>
<P>
   If such a concept indeed works, why isn't it being widely used?
Also, is there any way to clean the intake system, other than the
injectors, and without doing harm to the injectors? Finally, am I
worrying about something that I need not worry about?
</P>
<P>
   _ R.P. Borsody, Dacula, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   A: What I thought would be a fairly simple answer to your
question about ``Multec'' self-cleaning injectors actually turned
into an extensive research exercise.
</P>
<P>
   I accessed the International Automotive Technicians Network at
www.iatn.net and checked out the archives in both the Technical
Theory and Technical Discussion forums.
</P>
<P>
   I found that my original understanding of this type of injectors
has been debated to the ``nth'' degree. An evolutionary history
might help explain the situation.
</P>
<P>
   When GM introduced electronic ``port fuel injection'' in the
mid-1980s, it used a standard pintle and seat injector design.
</P>
<P>
   Basically, this is a tapered needle that fits into a small hole.
When the injector is supposed to squirt fuel, the pintle (needle)
is electrically raised out of the hole (seat). Fuel goes through
the hole into the engine.
</P>
<P>
   When the proper amount of fuel has been squirted, the
electricity to the injector is turned off and the pintle returns to
the seat, stopping the fuel.
</P>
<P>
   It sort of works like a toilet. When you push the handle on the
toilet, a flapper valve in the tank opens a passage for enough
water to enter the bowl, flush the contents and fill the bowl. The
flapper valve seats, the tank fills up and the water shuts off.
Unfortunately, some variables showed up. The quality of the fuel
itself was largely to blame, as it lacked the additives necessary
to keep the injectors clean.
</P>
<P>
   The early injector design compounded the problem. The result was
that after a short period of driving _ within the manufacturer's
warranty _ fuel deposits cooked onto the pintle and seat.
</P>
<P>
   The result was much like a flapper valve that becomes encrusted
with mineral deposits. The valve doesn't seat, the tank never fills
completely and the toilet doesn't flush right.
</P>
<P>
   The varnish-coated fuel injectors impeded both fuel flow through
the injectors as well as hindering their ability to seat. This, in
turn, caused multitudes of engine performance and driveability
nightmares.
</P>
<P>
   In the effort to control the expense of injector replacement,
the first line of defense was fuel injector cleaning, supplemented
with fuel additives for the tank.
</P>
<P>
   Although GM was specific about the chemicals, proportions and
technique, the directions were soon overwhelmed. A flood of
``performance-enhancing fuel injection cleaners'' hit the market.
</P>
<P>
   Many of these products contained strong chemicals that ``cured''
the short-term symptoms but attacked and ultimately deteriorated
system components.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, consumers and the repair industry alike commonly
misused the products, adopting the ``if one is good then two must
be better'' fix-it approach.
</P>
<P>
   Two things were certain. First, if this type of fuel injection
system was going to survive, fuel quality and injector design would
need to become more compatible. Second, there was little likelihood
of the improvements happening simultaneously.

 &HT;    Buick strikes gold with Tiger Woods endorsement
 &HT;    By Linda Sharp
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Using celebrities to draw attention to their products
is nothing new in the automotive industry.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1950s, Dinah Shore was singing the praises of seeing the
U.S.A. in a Chevrolet. A Chrysler Cordoba will forever be linked to
Ricardo Montalban and Corinthian leather, and everybody knows that
Newnan country music star Alan Jackson is ``crazy 'bout a Ford
truck.''
</P>
<P>
   But an endorsement can do more than draw attention. It can
change an image.
</P>
<P>
   For a long time, Buick has been a sponsor of the PGA and the
professional golf tour. Now Buick has linked itself to the hottest
commodity in golf and perhaps in all of American marketing: Tiger
Woods.
</P>
<P>
   It is no secret that Buicks have been thought of as cars
primarily for the older set. How quickly we have forgotten the fury
of the potent Wildcats of the '50s and '60s or the fire-breathing
Regal Grand Nationals. I think General Motors did the Buick brand a
great disservice when it yanked it from NASCAR competition. Names
like Bobby Allison and Harry Gant not only helped to win on Sunday
and then sell on Monday, but also generated pride among Buick
drivers.
</P>
<P>
   Back to Tiger. If you have any doubts about his drawing power,
I'd like to share a personal experience. When Woods was playing in
his first Masters competition, my husband and I had stopped that
afternoon in a Memphis barbecue establishment.
</P>
<P>
   A Los Angeles Lakers basketball game was playing on the
television. Shortly, two teenagers came in. They asked the
proprietor if they could change the channel to watch the Masters.
This young man has clout, not only in the golf community but also
among a young and diverse cross section of America.
</P>
<P>
   And why shouldn't he? He is a marketer's dream _ young,
clean-cut, articulate and exceptionally talented.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, Buick is running an ad campaign that links Tiger to
the Olympics _ well, sort of. We all know that golf is not an
Olympic sport, but Woods takes the ``gold'' _ a gold-colored Buick,
that is _ when he hits a ball farther than a discus and into the
bull's-eye of the archery target.
</P>
<P>
   Buick likewise has won the gold with Tiger Woods.

 &HT;    First injectors needed improvement
 &HT;    By Nora Carter
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _
</P>
<P>
   Q: I am the original owner of a 1990 Camaro with the
six-cylinder engine and less than 80,000 miles on it. It has had
only one tune-up yet still passes the emissions test with flying
colors. The garage I use suggests I have a cleaning solution run
through my fuel injectors. However, my owner's manual tells me that
the fuel injectors are self-cleaning and could be ruined by having
them cleaned.
</P>
<P>
   My questions to both mechanics and factory reps about the
workings or this ``self-cleaning system'' have yet to be answered.
</P>
<P>
   If such a concept indeed works, why isn't it being widely used?
Also, is there any way to clean the intake system, other than the
injectors, and without doing harm to the injectors? Finally, am I
worrying about something that I need not worry about?
</P>
<P>
   _ R.P. Borsody, Dacula, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   A: What I thought would be a fairly simple answer to your
question about ``Multec'' self-cleaning injectors actually turned
into an extensive research exercise.
</P>
<P>
   I accessed the International Automotive Technicians Network at
www.iatn.net and checked out the archives in both the Technical
Theory and Technical Discussion forums.
</P>
<P>
   I found that my original understanding of this type of injectors
has been debated to the ``nth'' degree. An evolutionary history
might help explain the situation.
</P>
<P>
   When GM introduced electronic ``port fuel injection'' in the
mid-1980s, it used a standard pintle and seat injector design.
</P>
<P>
   Basically, this is a tapered needle that fits into a small hole.
When the injector is supposed to squirt fuel, the pintle (needle)
is electrically raised out of the hole (seat). Fuel goes through
the hole into the engine.
</P>
<P>
   When the proper amount of fuel has been squirted, the
electricity to the injector is turned off and the pintle returns to
the seat, stopping the fuel.
</P>
<P>
   It sort of works like a toilet. When you push the handle on the
toilet, a flapper valve in the tank opens a passage for enough
water to enter the bowl, flush the contents and fill the bowl. The
flapper valve seats, the tank fills up and the water shuts off.
Unfortunately, some variables showed up. The quality of the fuel
itself was largely to blame, as it lacked the additives necessary
to keep the injectors clean.
</P>
<P>
   The early injector design compounded the problem. The result was
that after a short period of driving _ within the manufacturer's
warranty _ fuel deposits cooked onto the pintle and seat.
</P>
<P>
   The result was much like a flapper valve that becomes encrusted
with mineral deposits. The valve doesn't seat, the tank never fills
completely and the toilet doesn't flush right.
</P>
<P>
   The varnish-coated fuel injectors impeded both fuel flow through
the injectors as well as hindering their ability to seat. This, in
turn, caused multitudes of engine performance and driveability
nightmares.
</P>
<P>
   In the effort to control the expense of injector replacement,
the first line of defense was fuel injector cleaning, supplemented
with fuel additives for the tank.
</P>
<P>
   Although GM was specific about the chemicals, proportions and
technique, the directions were soon overwhelmed. A flood of
``performance-enhancing fuel injection cleaners'' hit the market.
</P>
<P>
   Many of these products contained strong chemicals that ``cured''
the short-term symptoms but attacked and ultimately deteriorated
system components.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, consumers and the repair industry alike commonly
misused the products, adopting the ``if one is good then two must
be better'' fix-it approach.
</P>
<P>
   Two things were certain. First, if this type of fuel injection
system was going to survive, fuel quality and injector design would
need to become more compatible. Second, there was little likelihood
of the improvements happening simultaneously.

 &HT;    FOREIGN JOURNAL: MY GOLFING GRANDFATHER MIGHT HAVE WARMED TO
CUBA
 &HT;    DUPLICATION ALERT: Moving in (i) international and (f) financial
categories
 &HT;    Eds: Can be twinned with CUBA-EMBARGO
 &HT;    For release Sunday, Sept. 24
 &HT;    By MIKE WILLIAMS
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   VARADERO, Cuba _ They called my grandfather ``Chief,'' partly
because he liked to give orders. He never hesitated making big
decisions: in the depths of the Great Depression, he turned his
40-acre farm in Tuscaloosa, Alabama into a 9-hole golf course.
</P>
<P>
   I never really knew Chief because he died when I was six years
old, just before the Cuban missile crisis.
</P>
<P>
   But he was a man of his times, and I'm guessing Chief feared the
red menace just as deeply as most of his generation. He was
probably glad the teachers made us practice nuclear attack drills
by diving under our desks at school.
</P>
<P>
   Chief may be turning over in his grave now. I just played golf
in the heart of that communist land that once seemed to threaten
our existence.
</P>
<P>
   Golf. In Cuba. Now that's a contradiction of everything we
learned at those desks we dove under.
</P>
<P>
   For me, it's a symbol of just how fascinating a place Cuba is
today, caught somewhere between its revolutionary rhetoric and a
future none of its restless people can predict.
</P>
<P>
   Drive about 70 miles east from Havana to this glistening beach
resort and you pass fortresses built by Spanish Imperialists,
monuments to 19th Century Cuban revolutionaries and billboards
exhorting ``Socialism or Death.''
</P>
<P>
   Modern, air-conditioned buses whisk tourists along in comfort,
while on the roadsides, clumps of Cubans stand under any shady tree
they can find, waiting for the 40-year-old GMC buses that chug
along like visions from a black-and-white movie.
</P>
<P>
   The tourists pass huge blocks of apartment towers thrown up in
the hey-days of the 1960s, when Cuba was the Marxist beacon of the
hemisphere. The buildings are ugly, Soviet-inspired monsters, wash
hanging from open windows and paint peeling from the cracked
concrete walls.
</P>
<P>
   But the countryside is gorgeous, and the four-lane highway dips
through stands of trees and winds around a few U.S.
interstate-style cloverleafs.
</P>
<P>
   Then you reach Varadero.
</P>
<P>
   A beach resort for wealthy Cubans before the revolution, it
faded into dilapidation like the rest of Cuba under the communist
regime. But after the 1990 collapse of his communist patron, the
Soviet Union, Castro partnered with foreign companies to rejuvenate
the Cuban tourist economy.
</P>
<P>
   They poured money into moribund Varadero, building a line of
stunning new hotels that nestle next to the crystal-clear sea. It's
like Cancun, but the vendors sell T-shirts emblazoned with Che
Guevara's famous mug instead of ones that say, ``I got drunk at
Senor Frog's.''
</P>
<P>
   And Varadero is home to Cuba's only 18-hole golf course.
</P>
<P>
   To be precise, there is a 9-hole spread in Havana, but it's
ancient by modern golf standards.
</P>
<P>
   The Varadero layout might just as well be located in Hilton
Head: a stunning landscape of lakes, sand traps, verdant doglegs
and gorgeous ocean views was sculpted from the limestone and sand.
</P>
<P>
   Fittingly, though, there was a little of the socialist
philosophy alive in Cuba's one and only luxury golf course.
</P>
<P>
   No red golf balls, but if you rent clubs, it's strictly
egalitarian. The shop has 30 bags stuffed full of 30 exact
duplicate sets of clubs _ allowing for a few sets for lefties.
</P>
<P>
   I hit a few practice balls on the range before my round, but
forgot to buy tees.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here,'' the ball boy said in Spanish, digging in his pocket.
He handed over two wooden tees, then asked me to give them back
when I was finished. That seemed a little strange _ in the States,
tees are an afterthought.
</P>
<P>
   Back in the pro shop, a bag of tees cost $1.50. That's 15
percent of an average Cuban's $10 monthly wage.
</P>
<P>
   I decided to tip the ball boy after my round.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't hard to notice that there weren't any Cubans playing
the course. While tourists get the red-carpet treatment, Cubans
must pass through security checkpoints to enter Varadero's fancy
hotels. The only natives you see are the waiters, bellhops,
reception clerks and cleaning crews catering to the tourists.
</P>
<P>
   The course was fun, challenging enough that it has attracted a
stop of the European qualifying tour. All in all, golf in a
communist nation was pretty much like golf anywhere _ they had a
beer cart, it was very hot, and my shots somehow found the sand
traps and water hazards attractive.
</P>
<P>
   Back in the pro shop, the display of fine Cuban cigars reminded
me of Chief _ he loved a good cigar. He may even have smoked a few
Cubans in his day. But not after Castro took charge. The Cuba Chief
knew just before his death was a place of turmoil and hatred for
all things American.
</P>
<P>
   Many Cuban exiles insist it's still like that today.
</P>
<P>
   With members of their family still there, they know the place
better than I do. But I believe Cuba is changing, even under
Castro's iron grip. He can't let all these foreigners in without
consequences. Even if most Americans are prohibited from traveling
to Cuba, the place is swarming with tourists from democratic,
capitalist nations.
</P>
<P>
   The Cubans are talking with these visitors, asking questions
about the outside world. They already want the freedom to travel
and see things themselves, and the opportunity to make enough money
to do so. They want to be able to enjoy the luxury hotels and
restaurants now patronized by the visitors.
</P>
<P>
   One day, some of them may even want to play golf.
</P>
<P>
   ``We really, really hope the embargo gets lifted and the
Americans will come here,'' said the ball boy, grinning at my tip.
``You Americans only live 90 miles away, and you love golf.''

   VARADERO, Cuba _ The giant, rusted radar dishes stand silently
on a hillside near Havana pointing north, monuments to a past in
which this island waited tensely for an invasion from its neighbor
just 90 miles away across the Florida Straits.
</P>
<P>
   Now Cuba awaits _ even hopes for _ an American invasion of a
different sort.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hope the embargo will be lifted and the American tourists
will come,'' said Osmani Pedroso(cq), a public relations manager
for one of the upscale hotels that line the beach at Varadero,
Cuba's premier vacation resort about 70 miles east of Havana.
``Everybody in Cuba wants to see the Americans here.''
</P>
<P>
   That day could be on the horizon.
</P>
<P>
   Fresh from the Elian Gonzalez saga, Congress over the summer
passed a bill that would ease some of the restrictions of the
40-year-old U.S. embargo on trade with Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Most important to the legion of waiters, bellboys, maids and
desk clerks in Varadero, the bill would withhold funding for the
enforcement of U.S. restrictions on travel to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Although the measure still awaits final approval, it has stirred
an undercurrent of excitement here, where tourism industry workers
depend on tips from foreign guests to augment their meager
salaries. The average wage in Cuba hovers around $10 a month, even
as prices for everyday goods like food and clothing continue to
rise.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Americans have a different mentality,'' Pedroso said. ``We
have had a few of them visit here, and they are much better tippers
than the Europeans. Everyone here is praying that the embargo will
be lifted.''
</P>
<P>
   Currently, travel to Cuba by U.S. citizens is generally
restricted to those with family on the island, along with
journalists and people involved in cultural exchanges.
</P>
<P>
   By some estimates, as many as 100,000 Americans may have visited
Cuba last year _ most of them legal visitors coming to see family
members. But a growing number of Americans are defying the travel
ban, flying to the Bahamas or Mexico and catching flights on
foreign airlines into Havana or Varadero. Savvy Cuban immigration
officers don't stamp their passports, so there is no proof the
Americans have visited Cuba illegally.
</P>
<P>
   Keithe Bisnett (cq) and Bernice Zubrinsky (cq) of Los Angeles
recently came to Cuba legally as part of a cultural exchange
arranged by an American foundation. The women _ both avid travelers
_ were fascinated by the island.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of our friends are dying to come here,'' said Zubrinsky,
56. ``They were asking if we could bring them in our suitcases.
It's a wonderful, fascinating place and the people are so friendly.
We would come back here at the drop of a hat.''
</P>
<P>
   That's music to the ears of Cubans, who hope for a tremendous
boom in the biggest engine of their economy, tourism, if the
Americans are allowed to come.
</P>
<P>
   Just a decade ago, the communist nation had little
infrastructure in place to handle a large influx of foreign
visitors. With his hard Marxist line, Cuban dictator Fidel Castro
had spent his decades in power building schools and hospitals and
funding his military. Hotels fell into disrepair, along with much
of the rest of the country's buildings. Tourism was clearly an
afterthought.
</P>
<P>
   All that changed in 1990, when the Soviet Union collapsed and
Cuba lost billions in annual subsidies from its communist patron.
</P>
<P>
   His socialist revolution in peril, Castro turned to one of
Cuba's main resources: its natural beauty and tropical location.
Partnering with foreign firms from Canada, Italy, Spain and other
countries, Cuba undertook a massive drive to modernize its tourism
sector.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, Castro had ridden to power in the late 1950s on the
disgust of the Cuban people over the repression and corruption of
dictator Fulgencio Batista, who had turned Cuba into an
anything-goes tourism Bohemia for Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Varadero was a resort during that era, but most of its visitors
were wealthy Cubans. After the revolution, it fell into serious
disrepair.
</P>
<P>
   In just 10 years, though, the Cubans and their foreign partners
have transformed Varadero into the jewel of Cuba's tourist
initiative. A string of elaborate four- and five-star hotels crowd
the beach, their balconies towering over the azure sea.
</P>
<P>
   ``I grew up 15 kilometers away and when I was a boy, Varadero
was nothing like it is today,'' said Pedroso. ``Everything you see
here on this part of the beach is new. In 10 years the place has
changed so much.''
</P>
<P>
   At the luxury hotels, small music combos churn out a Caribbean
beat in the cool shade of open-air bistros, while tourists sip
exotic drinks, some paddling their way up to bars built into
swimming pools.
</P>
<P>
   Children laugh and splash in the surf, while young couples try
their luck sailing catamarans. Foursomes of sunburned men in bright
print shirts whack their way around a verdant new golf course.
Buses ferry tourists on excursions to a nearby limestone cave or on
scuba diving expeditions. Others ride in a submarine with windows
all around so tourists can see the wonders of the coral reefs.
</P>
<P>
   In short, Varadero is a newer version of the traditional
Caribbean vacation spots like Cancun or the Bahamas. Hordes of
Europeans and Canadians already flock here, many on cut-rate
packages that offer luxury hotel rooms with meals included for less
than $100 a day.
</P>
<P>
   And the Cubans _ with their foreign partners _ continue
building. Varadero's long, thin peninsula is a beehive of activity,
with construction cranes and bulldozers laboring away as the
skeletons of several massive new resorts rise from the sand dunes.
</P>
<P>
   Cuba has also begun developing other vacation destinations on
offshore islands, the southern coast and in the eastern provinces.
Historic Old Havana is also being refurbished, with several luxury
hotels already open and dozens of restoration projects underway.
</P>
<P>
   Tourist visits have climbed steadily throughout the 1990s, and
are on track to top 2 million in the current year.
</P>
<P>
   But the rapid development has not come without costs. With the
rest of the economy in shambles, Cubans flocked to the tourism
sector in the early 1990s. Those who couldn't find jobs in the
hotels took to the streets, offering to sell the visitors black
market cigars, CDs of Cuban music or cut-rate Cuban rum. Crowds of
desperate Cuban women became prostitutes.
</P>
<P>
   Castro cracked down on the prostitution and black-market
dealers, and now tourists can usually walk around the historic
district of Old Havana without being accosted.
</P>
<P>
   In Varadero, a toll booth was put up on the main route to the
resort, and Cubans must show identification before they are allowed
to enter the grounds of the luxury resorts.
</P>
<P>
   That has created resentment, with many Cubans saying they are
victims of ``tourism apartheid,'' barred from some of their
nation's most luxurious destinations.
</P>
<P>
   There are also growing conflicts as poor Cubans rub shoulders
with wealthier visitors. In a nation where the government has long
controlled every aspect of public life and relies on a network of
neighborhood committees that report on everything, the roaming
tourists are a wild card.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of tension just below the surface,'' said Jeff
Hardwick, a Canadian visiting Cuba for the first time. ``Every
other native I talk to says Cuba is beautiful, but then they say
they want to leave. If the Americans do come, it could create a lot
more tension between the haves and the have-nots.''
</P>
<P>
   A complete opening of Cuba to Americans could still be years
away. The Cuban-American exile community, which has long been a
powerful influence over U.S.-Cuba policy, has vowed to block the
bill easing the travel restrictions.
</P>
<P>
   But everyday Cubans continue to wait and hope for an invasion of
Americans in Bermuda shorts and beachwear. Their sentiments are
shared by some of the Americans who have been to the island.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our biggest disappointment is that now we want to come back
and we can't because it isn't legal,'' said Keithe Bisnett. ``Of
all the places I've ever visited, this has been the most
fascinating. It's beautiful and safe and the people are kind. Forty
years have passed and enough is enough.''

 &HT;    FOREIGN JOURNAL: MY GOLFING GRANDFATHER MIGHT HAVE WARMED TO
CUBA
 &HT;    DUPLICATION ALERT: Moving in (i) international and (f) financial
categories
 &HT;    Eds: Can be twinned with CUBA-EMBARGO
 &HT;    For release Sunday, Sept. 24

<TEXT>
<P>
   VARADERO, Cuba _ They called my grandfather ``Chief,'' partly
because he liked to give orders. He never hesitated making big
decisions: in the depths of the Great Depression, he turned his
40-acre farm in Tuscaloosa, Alabama into a 9-hole golf course.
</P>
<P>
   I never really knew Chief because he died when I was six years
old, just before the Cuban missile crisis.
</P>
<P>
   But he was a man of his times, and I'm guessing Chief feared the
red menace just as deeply as most of his generation. He was
probably glad the teachers made us practice nuclear attack drills
by diving under our desks at school.
</P>
<P>
   Chief may be turning over in his grave now. I just played golf
in the heart of that communist land that once seemed to threaten
our existence.
</P>
<P>
   Golf. In Cuba. Now that's a contradiction of everything we
learned at those desks we dove under.
</P>
<P>
   For me, it's a symbol of just how fascinating a place Cuba is
today, caught somewhere between its revolutionary rhetoric and a
future none of its restless people can predict.
</P>
<P>
   Drive about 70 miles east from Havana to this glistening beach
resort and you pass fortresses built by Spanish Imperialists,
monuments to 19th Century Cuban revolutionaries and billboards
exhorting ``Socialism or Death.''
</P>
<P>
   Modern, air-conditioned buses whisk tourists along in comfort,
while on the roadsides, clumps of Cubans stand under any shady tree
they can find, waiting for the 40-year-old GMC buses that chug
along like visions from a black-and-white movie.
</P>
<P>
   The tourists pass huge blocks of apartment towers thrown up in
the hey-days of the 1960s, when Cuba was the Marxist beacon of the
hemisphere. The buildings are ugly, Soviet-inspired monsters, wash
hanging from open windows and paint peeling from the cracked
concrete walls.
</P>
<P>
   But the countryside is gorgeous, and the four-lane highway dips
through stands of trees and winds around a few U.S.
interstate-style cloverleafs.
</P>
<P>
   Then you reach Varadero.
</P>
<P>
   A beach resort for wealthy Cubans before the revolution, it
faded into dilapidation like the rest of Cuba under the communist
regime. But after the 1990 collapse of his communist patron, the
Soviet Union, Castro partnered with foreign companies to rejuvenate
the Cuban tourist economy.
</P>
<P>
   They poured money into moribund Varadero, building a line of
stunning new hotels that nestle next to the crystal-clear sea. It's
like Cancun, but the vendors sell T-shirts emblazoned with Che
Guevara's famous mug instead of ones that say, ``I got drunk at
Senor Frog's.''
</P>
<P>
   And Varadero is home to Cuba's only 18-hole golf course.
</P>
<P>
   To be precise, there is a 9-hole spread in Havana, but it's
ancient by modern golf standards.
</P>
<P>
   The Varadero layout might just as well be located in Hilton
Head: a stunning landscape of lakes, sand traps, verdant doglegs
and gorgeous ocean views was sculpted from the limestone and sand.
</P>
<P>
   Fittingly, though, there was a little of the socialist
philosophy alive in Cuba's one and only luxury golf course.
</P>
<P>
   No red golf balls, but if you rent clubs, it's strictly
egalitarian. The shop has 30 bags stuffed full of 30 exact
duplicate sets of clubs _ allowing for a few sets for lefties.
</P>
<P>
   I hit a few practice balls on the range before my round, but
forgot to buy tees.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here,'' the ball boy said in Spanish, digging in his pocket.
He handed over two wooden tees, then asked me to give them back
when I was finished. That seemed a little strange _ in the States,
tees are an afterthought.
</P>
<P>
   Back in the pro shop, a bag of tees cost $1.50. That's 15
percent of an average Cuban's $10 monthly wage.
</P>
<P>
   I decided to tip the ball boy after my round.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't hard to notice that there weren't any Cubans playing
the course. While tourists get the red-carpet treatment, Cubans
must pass through security checkpoints to enter Varadero's fancy
hotels. The only natives you see are the waiters, bellhops,
reception clerks and cleaning crews catering to the tourists.
</P>
<P>
   The course was fun, challenging enough that it has attracted a
stop of the European qualifying tour. All in all, golf in a
communist nation was pretty much like golf anywhere _ they had a
beer cart, it was very hot, and my shots somehow found the sand
traps and water hazards attractive.
</P>
<P>
   Back in the pro shop, the display of fine Cuban cigars reminded
me of Chief _ he loved a good cigar. He may even have smoked a few
Cubans in his day. But not after Castro took charge. The Cuba Chief
knew just before his death was a place of turmoil and hatred for
all things American.
</P>
<P>
   Many Cuban exiles insist it's still like that today.
</P>
<P>
   With members of their family still there, they know the place
better than I do. But I believe Cuba is changing, even under
Castro's iron grip. He can't let all these foreigners in without
consequences. Even if most Americans are prohibited from traveling
to Cuba, the place is swarming with tourists from democratic,
capitalist nations.
</P>
<P>
   The Cubans are talking with these visitors, asking questions
about the outside world. They already want the freedom to travel
and see things themselves, and the opportunity to make enough money
to do so. They want to be able to enjoy the luxury hotels and
restaurants now patronized by the visitors.
</P>
<P>
   One day, some of them may even want to play golf.
</P>
<P>
   ``We really, really hope the embargo gets lifted and the
Americans will come here,'' said the ball boy, grinning at my tip.
``You Americans only live 90 miles away, and you love golf.''

   OLY-SCALPING (Sydney) _ Chris Miller, a professional ticket
scalper, says he likes to think of himself as an ``Olympic
entrepreneur.'' This is not the first Olympic Games he has worked;
he hustled tickets in Atlanta, Barcelona and Nagano. Like hundreds
of other scalpers who have descended upon Sydney from the United
States, Great Britain and other countries, he is part of an
international netherworld that buys and sells tickets. The scalping
underworld, and the people and organizations it does business with,
received some unwanted attention Thursday. The International
Olympic Committee said it had launched an investigation into
allegations that tickets distributed to national Olympic committees
of various countries, including the United States, had been
illegally sold to a network of professional scalpers. By Andrew
Ross Sorkin.

   OLY-GYM-WOMEN (Sydney) _ An unfathomable error made in the
measurement of the vault apparatus during the women's Olympic
all-around final Thursday night may have cost former World Champion
Svetlana Khorkina a chance to medal and also cast doubt on the
validity of the outcome. Unflustered by the situation, Romania
became the first country to have its gymnasts take the gold, silver
and bronze medals since the former Soviet Union swept in 1960. By

   OLY-SWM-MEN (Sydney) _ Lenny Krayzelburg's body was tightening
up and the pain was gripping him. He was still leading the
200-meter backstroke in world record-challenging time, but his only
goal in the last half of the race Thursday was to fend off his
American teammate, Aaron Peirsol, and Matthew Welsh of Australia.
Whatever his struggles, Krayzelburg increased his lead over his
pursuers in each 50-meter segment of the race to take his second
gold medal of the Summer Games, in an Olympic record time. By

Inger Miller in the women's 100 meters, and barring an improbable
reversal of fortune and direction, Cathy Freeman no longer needs to
worry about Marie-Jose Perec in the women's 400. Two of the marquee
races in these Olympics are no longer worth marking in bold letters
after Miller's withdrawal because of an injury and Perec's hurried

   SYDNEY, Australia _ Eurelijus Zukauskas, whom Alonzo Mourning
had never heard of before Thursday night, stepped to the foul line
with 1 minute 9 seconds remaining in an astoundingly close game
between the United States basketball team and Lithuania.
</P>
<P>
   Mourning, the Miami Heat's All-Star center, had fouled the
7-foot-2-inch Lithuanian center, and suddenly a collection of
relatively unknown Eastern European players could close to within
three points of the United States _ perhaps two possessions away
from electrifying the world, never mind the Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a miracle were to ever happen, this was probably the
instant,'' said Donn Nelson, the Lithuanian assistant coach.
</P>
<P>
   Zukauskas took a deep breath, bent his knees and squared to the
basket. His first free throw bounced harmlessly off the iron and so
did the second. American basketball supremacy had survived for
another day.
</P>
<P>
   Final score: Team USA 85, Lithuania 76.
</P>
<P>
   Logic: 0.
</P>
<P>
   Little made sense. The Lithuanians, coming closer to the U.S.
men than any team had in eight years, played the Game that Time
Forgot Thursday night at the Dome in Olympic Park.
</P>
<P>
   Working the 30-second clock like an antiquated, four-corner
North Carolina team, they clogged the lanes, got back on transition
and held Vince Carter and one of the greatest collections of
open-court performers to a mere four points on the fastbreak.
</P>
<P>
   But the Lithuanians also forgot to make their free throws,
missing 16 of 43 foul shots, including four in the final minutes.
</P>
<P>
   In Lithuania, it may go down as ``the day the Americans almost
fell.'' Back in the States, it will be remembered as ``the
afternoon we took a game off.``
</P>
<P>
   Nelson, the son of Dallas Mavericks Coach Don Nelson and an
assistant for the Lithuanians for 10 years, said: ``We got lucky.
They missed some shots and we played the perfect game in a lot of
respects. But I still don't see it happening in my lifetime.''
</P>
<P>
   Carter scored 6 of his 12 points in the final 2:45, including a
tough lay-in with 40 seconds left to push the lead to seven and
effectively end the game. Along with Gary Payton and Kevin Garnett,
Carter resorted to his usual preening and got into mild physical
altercations with his defenders, who kept looking for a trash-talk
translator so they could understand what one of their favorite
American players was saying.
</P>
<P>
   The United States led by 47-41 at halftime, enough to make Coach
Rudy Tomjanovich use some choice words for the sleepwalking NBA
All-Stars. Team USA seemed to be pulling away midway through the
second half, but then the Lithuanians caught fire.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a little closer than we like it,'' admitted Steve
Smith, whose 0-for-4 shooting night contributed to his team's 35.7
percent shooting percentage. ``Was I worried? Not really. But that
was interesting. They played hard.''
</P>
<P>
   Never had an international team come within 10 points of the NBA
players. Since Michael Jordan and the league's band of global
superstars were first allowed to compete in 1992, the closest
anyone came to the U.S. men was Spain, who lost by 15 points at the
1994 World Championships in Toronto. Their next closest competitor
was Lithuania, who lost by 22 points in Atlanta four years ago.
</P>
<P>
   That team featured the international legend, Aryvdas Sabonis,
along with Sarunas Marciulonis and Arturo Karnisovas. Marciulonis
is retired, while Sabonis and Karnisovas missed the trip to Sydney
because of injuries.
</P>
<P>
   ``This Lithuanian team is capable of following a game plan,
unlike the Lithuanian teams of old,'' Nelson said. ``I thought this
team had a better shot at winning than the others because of
that.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The game was played virtually in slow motion, with the sellout
crowd of 8,391 at times barely reacting, or perhaps having trouble
believing what was happening. The crowd finally exploded with 2:11
remaining when Mindaugas Timinskas scored inside to erase most of a
14-point deficit and trim the lead to 79-74.
</P>
<P>
   He drew a foul against Allan Houston on the play, and had a
chance to cut it to four, but missed. A minute later Zukauskas drew
the foul against Mourning with 1:09 left.
</P>
<P>
   But Zukauskas's free throws caught the rim both times and
bounced harmlessly away, drawing sighs from the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   It all seemed surreal, even more so since the game was played
only hours after the Knicks had traded Patrick Ewing to Seattle in
a four-team deal that directly affected two Team USA players,
Payton and Vin Baker, both of whom play for Seattle. Ewing's new
teammates, sitting in the back of the team bus en route to the
game, were congratulated by the other players.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gary and me kept giving fives to each other in the back,
soaking it all in,'' Baker said. ``Alonzo came on the bus and said,
`Congratulations.' We feel like we made out.''
</P>
<P>
   They probably would not have felt that way if they were riding
that bus as victims of one of the biggest upsets in Olympics
history, ranking right up there with the 1980 Soviet hockey team's
loss to the United States and the 1972 U.S. men's basketball team's
loss to the Soviets.
</P>
<P>
   But Baker said such thoughts never entered his mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``You weren't watching the faces of the Lithuanian players at
the end of the game,'' he said. ``Their faces weren't telling you
they were thinking about winning. Their victory was just getting as
close as they did. In order to win that kind of game, you've got to
execute in the final minutes, make big buckets. I could be wrong,
but they seemed pretty happy to be where they were.''

&HT;     FOR A TASTE FROM DOWN UNDER, TRY VEGEMITE 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By BONNIE WALKER  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ The fact that the Olympic Games are well under way
and Americans are suddenly interested in all things Australian
might explain my sudden urge to taste Vegemite.
</P>
<P>
   In the land Down Under, ``where women glow and men plunder,'' as
the Men at Work song says, Vegemite is a staple. It's a deep, dark
concoction made from brewers' yeast, salt, vegetables such as
celery and onion, and caramel coloring. The resulting concentrated
paste can be spread on bread for a simple but nourishing sandwich
(it contains plenty of vitamin B).
</P>
<P>
   This is an exotic product only in the strictest sense of the
word. Many of us have, for years, eyed those brightly labeled jars
of Vegemite (pronounced VEJ-uh-mite) at the grocery store, usually
tucked between the Nutella and Marmite (similar to Vegemite).
</P>
<P>
   Now, obviously, was an auspicious time to pick up a jar and give
it a try. But I wasn't going alone.
</P>
<P>
   So I spread Vegemite thinly on small wedges of pita bread and
passed it around to co-workers one afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   All were admitted Vegemite virgins; here are a few of their
responses:
</P>
<P>
   ``It, it ... tastes like sardines, but without the fish taste.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Hmm, smells like vitamins, you know, when you first open the
jar?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Would I eat a sandwich of this? I wish I hadn't eaten this
much.''
</P>
<P>
   ``No.''
</P>
<P>
   Here's a bit of history, from a Vegemite Web site: Vegemite was
invented in 1922 by a scientist, Dr. Cyril Callister in Melbourne.
During World War II, Vegemite was included in food rations for
sailors, soldiers and civilians, leading to its popularity among
Australians. While the company name changed to Kraft Foods Ltd. in
1950, the Vegemite name lived on.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'll find Australian kids, 3-, 6-months old getting it from
their mothers. They're raised on it and they really develop a jones
for it,'' says Allen Sipole, a Californian who distributes it in
the United States through West Bay Sales and Robern Australian
Fruit.
</P>
<P>
   According to Sipole, Vegemite can be found in 90 percent of
Australian households. And 70,000 jars were sold in the United
States last year.
</P>
<P>
   Does Sipole like it?
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, I don't eat it on a regular basis _ um, it's an acquired
taste,'' Sipole said. He suggested trying it the Aussie way, for
breakfast, spread (thinly) on hot toast, and ``cut'' with plenty of
butter. Or, use it as a chef friend of his does, as a flavor
booster for gumbo.
</P>
<P>
   Did I like it? Well, I can't say it made me glow. At least not
at first. But after spreading it on a tortilla chip and (mentally)
accompanying it with a glass of, say, Cooper's stout, I could
begin, oh so dimly, to see an appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Those who do acquire a taste for Vegemite and cannot find it
locally can go to Sipole's Vegemite Web site at
www.ozchannel.com/vegemite.
</P>
<P>
   And one more thing, mates _ don't drink wine, even good Aussie
wine, with that Vegemite sandwich.
</P>
<P>
   ``Beer,'' Sipole said. ``Definitely beer.''

HEAVYWEIGHT SHOWDOWN LOOMS FOR CUBA'S SAVON AND BENNETT OF THE
U.S.

 By BILL PENNINGTON    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia _ For effect, or perhaps just because he can,
the fabled Cuban heavyweight boxing champion Felix Savon enters a
boxing ring not by dipping between the ropes, but by lifting one
leg at a time over the top rope with the ease of someone stepping
into a warm bath.
</P>
<P>
   The 6-foot-6{-inch Savon will not stoop to begin a bout. The
intimidation begins with the entrance.
</P>
<P>
   The American heavyweight Michael Bennett, who faces Savon next
week in what amounts to a gold medal level fight in the second
round of the Olympic boxing tournament, doesn't have a trick
entrance. He wasn't impressed with Savon's either.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a big man, he can do what he wants, but age catches up
with everyone,'' Bennett said of the 33-year-old Savon, the
two-time defending Olympic champion. ``Sometimes you don't think
you've lost a step, but you have.''
</P>
<P>
   It appeared Thursday that Bennett and his coach, Tom Mustin,
have their own mind games planned to counteract the mystique
surrounding Savon as their featured Tuesday afternoon bout
approaches. Thursday, after Bennett and Savon each easily advanced,
both Bennett and Mustin cast Savon _ the six-time world champion _
as past his prime.
</P>
<P>
   ``He looks a little vulnerable,'' Mustin said after watching
Savon's easy defeat of Nigeria's Rasmus Ojemaye. ``I thought the
Nigerian wobbled him a little with left hands. He doesn't look like
he takes a punch the way he used to.''
</P>
<P>
   Bennett, meanwhile, was visited in the locker room by Evander
Holyfield after his first-round victory over Poland's Wojciech
Bartnik. Holyfield also gave Bennett his scouting report on how to
beat Savon.
</P>
<P>
   ``He gave me a few tips, hopefully I'll be able to capitalize on
them,'' Bennett said. ``But I can't give you those secrets.''
</P>
<P>
   Savon did not talk to reporters after his fight, and his
longtime coach Alcides Sagarra maintained the media silence he has
kept since arriving in Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   But the Savon-Bennett fight is at the heart of the rivalry
between the American and Cuban boxers, who have been the class of
the Olympic boxing tournament. Only one Cuban, 20-year-old Roberto
Guerra Rivera, and one American, welterweight Donte Craig, have
lost.
</P>
<P>
   The byplay between Savon and Bennett has been building for
nearly a year since Savon refused to fight Bennett in the finals of
the 1999 world championships. Savon, on Sagarra's urging, was
protesting a controversial decision against a Cuban teammate
earlier in the competition. That decision was later overturned, but
Savon had already forsaken his world title as Bennett won in a
walkover.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was really disappointing _ to not get the chance to face
him right then,'' Bennett said. ``That's why all I want is another
chance.''
</P>
<P>
   The plain-spoken Mustin said he wasn't sure how Bennett was
going to fare against Savon last year. The 29-year-old Bennett, who
spent seven years in prison for armed robbery, has only been
competing for two years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Michael was still pretty raw at times last year,'' Mustin
said. ``He's much more prepared now.''
</P>
<P>
   There really is no secret to what Bennett will have to do to win
in Tuesday's quarterfinal bout. Savon uses his long reach to keep
opponents from scoring against him and follows a pesky but
innocuous left jab with a thunderous right hand. Bennett, who is
six inches shorter but weighs the same as Savon at 201 pounds, will
have to get inside with short choppy counterpunches, but first he
will have to deflect Savon's attacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Michael will have to keep his hands high, not be intimidated
and think through the whole fight,'' Mustin said.
</P>
<P>
   When Bennett wasn't discussing tactics for Savon Thursday, he
was recounting his highly unique path to the Olympics. In 1993,
Bennett began his sentence in the Illinois penitentiary system for
the after-hours robbery of a Toys `R Us warehouse in his native
Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Bennett, who had been a high school and junior college football
star, was tutored in boxing by three fellow inmates who were
serving life sentences. He said Thursday that he knew they were now
pulling for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure they're happy for me,'' he said. ``I know those guys
are rooting for me, but it's hard because it's against the rules
for me to talk to them or be in any contact with them. Some of
those men will never come home because they made mistakes that cost
a lot more than mine.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all make mistakes, some just cost more than others.''

&HT;     CREATIVE WAYS FOR MEN TO DRESS IN STYLE 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By ROSE MARY BUDGE  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Menswear for fall ranges from traditional to tough: Wall
Street-wear on one hand, Shaft chic on the other.
</P>
<P>
   Whether a guy goes for elegant business suits or edgy black
leather, he's going to look more sophisticated and polished this
season, says David Wolfe, a trend analyst with the Donegar Group in
New York. Fashion is doing a 180-degree turn from dressing down to
dressing up. And all across the board clothes are looking cooler,
classier and better coordinated.
</P>
<P>
   That means it's time to ditch the scruffy jeans and rumpled
T-shirt and rock to a new tune. Sure, a man can be laid-back. But
he can't ever look like he went into the closet blindfolded _ not
even on casual Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We went as low as we could go,'' Wolfe says. ``Now, thank
goodness, we're moving back up. Finally we've decided it's no crime
to dress well. Even indulge in luxury.''
</P>
<P>
   Luxury begins with leather, the butter-soft and hard-as-nails
material worn by the movie cop Shaft. Go for the whole enchilada
the way Shaft does _ tight leather pants and long leather coat.
It'll blow 'em away. Or take a more conservative route. Forgo
head-to-toe leather and choose a single piece such as a classic car
coat or bomber jacket.
</P>
<P>
   In top-quality lamb or calf leather, the jacket will give you
fashion mileage for years. Carina Sokolaswski, a spokeswoman for J.
Crew, says leather jackets aren't fads. They can serve as staples
in a man's wardrobe and work with anything from jeans to dress
pants. But the stuff doesn't come cheap. Plan on paying a couple of
hundred at least.
</P>
<P>
   If the paycheck can't stretch that far, consider pleather. The
synthetic mimics the real thing and usually costs less. Another
option: black microfiber or featherweight nylon. Donna Karan's
men's collection, available at Macy's, includes acetate/nylon
bombers for $98 that can handle even warm climate. Similar styles
for even less are at J.C. Penney, Sears and Kmart. Not leather, but
the same attitude.
</P>
<P>
   Attitude counts this fall. Whether you spend a lot or a little,
be sure the clothes have urban appeal and express your personality.
And don't be afraid to experiment. The sharpest dressers think
outside the box.
</P>
<P>
   If you've always been a tweedy sweater guy, give it a rest. Get
into Wall Street pinstripes for a change. Suits have never looked
better. The construction is more comfy thanks to precise tailoring
and a bit of stretch. Silhouettes have slimmed down, pant legs are
more tapered, jacket lapels are narrower. And those double-breasted
coats that added about 10 pounds to everybody's physique have been
shoved to the back of the closet. Now it's the three-button suit
with side vents that flatters almost every man's figure.
</P>
<P>
   Gray, charcoal and black dominate, along with subtle pinstripes
and shadow plaids. And for the fashion-forward guy, who's a fan of
``The Sopranos,'' there's retro this season. The vested suit, a
staple in the '30s and '40s, has returned. This time the
three-piecer is sleeker, however, and joined by another option: the
shirt-tie-suit in one color family. Call it ``Mafia
monochromatic.''
</P>
<P>
   Granted, if you go for any new suit _ especially one that
carries a designer label such as Armani, Zegna or Hugo Boss _ it
can be costly. But there are ways to get around that.
</P>
<P>
   For the man with limited funds, a sport coat might be a better
investment than a suit to begin with. The junior exec can team a
sport jacket with flannel slacks and shirts and ties for the
office. For weekends, the coat goes with casual pants or jeans.
When he gets that first raise, that's the time to add a suit with
all the trimmings.
</P>
<P>
   Both suits and sport jackets can work with white shirts, the
wardrobe essential no businessman can live without. Classy French
cuffs are back this fall. Collars are spreading out to accommodate
Windsor knots.
</P>
<P>
   Never underestimate the power of a well-tied, well-made silk
cravat. It's the mark of the well-dressed gentleman.
</P>
<P>
   For many seasons, ties have averaged around 3 1/2 inches. This
fall they're narrowing to about 3 inches wide. The new background
colors are subtle orange, rust and olive. Patterns are steadily
getting smaller and more tasteful, and conversational ties that
look like a costume party are out. Emulate Cary Grant, the elegant
actor whose ties popularized sophisticated understatement.
</P>
<P>
   On weekends, trade the tie for a turtleneck. A lightweight
cotton turtleneck in a vibrant shade or that big-city color, black,
can make jeans or cords snap to attention.
</P>
<P>
   Leon Hall, spokesman for The Fashion Association, a New
York-based organization representing the menswear industry, often
wears turtlenecks at night and dresses up his tux with a sparkling
lapel pin. It's a bit offbeat, maybe, in a world of bow ties and
cummerbunds. But why not have some fun and express your personality
instead of wearing the usual menswear uniform?
</P>
<P>
   Follow the trends but don't take them too seriously, Hall
advises. The three-button suit might not be your style, and leather
sure doesn't suit everybody. So don't be afraid to exert your
individuality. Hall's personal choice for fall is as far from Shaft
as Shanghai is from San Antonio. He's into a sport jacket in a
textured melange of wool by Jhane Barnes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's as comfortable as a cardigan,'' Hall says. ``And it's the
kind of jacket that won't ever go out of style because the cut is
classic and the color mix works with almost everything.''
</P>
<P>
   If you want to follow Hall's lead, get a tweedy sport coat that
features, say, gray, rust and black. Buy slacks in matching colors
and add turtlenecks in shades to match the slacks. Accessorize with
brown suede shoes and belt.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this mini wardrobe could take a man just about
anywhere,'' Hall says. ``It works in America, it works in Europe,
it works in big cities and small towns. The clothes are timeless
but timely.''
</P>
<P>
   And that makes them a smart choice for fall.

   Reader Rabbit is the cartoon embodiment of The Learning
Company's educational programs for children. The rabbit has been
around since 1984, so he's getting long in the whiskers. (Actually,
you'll see he's clean shaven if you look closely at the picture on
the box.) Some of his early computer kids are probably college
graduates by now.
</P>
<P>
   That says a lot for any software's ability to keep up with the
marketplace, where time is like dog years: One year in the software
business equates to several in any other.
</P>
<P>
   The company recently announced four titles in its Learning
Creations series: Reader Rabbit Preschool, Reader Rabbit
Kindergarten, Reader Rabbit 1st Grade and Reader Rabbit 2nd Grade.
The programs are available for Windows and Macintosh systems for
about $20.
</P>
<P>
   Each grade level is unique, and each contains one of the
company's new Learning Creations activities. There are four of
them, one for each title:
</P>
<P>
   Children learn the concepts of time, days of the week, months of
the year, and seasons using a Learning Creations calendar program.
They can keep track of dates, make notations about the weather on a
particular day, and use animal and plant stickers to customize the
months of the year. Pages can be printed.
</P>
<P>
   A drawing program, Make a Masterpiece, lets children mix paints
and use them to color in pictures of the world. Stamps that form
letters of the alphabet can also be used to make words.
</P>
<P>
   Music Maker and its companion program, Rhythm Maker, contain
music activities, both passive and active. By listening to new and
old children's tunes, children begin to recognize notes and pitch.
Using Music Maker, then can drop whole, half and quarter notes and
rests onto treble and bass clefs of the grand staff. They can play
their compositions using a variety of musical sounds.
</P>
<P>
   Carried over from previous versions is a learning system that
adjusts the difficulty of games and puzzles in the program to the
child's learning speed.
</P>
<P>
   And workbooks, based on a child's game data and personalized
awards he or she has won in the programs are now available on the
Web (www.readerrabbit.com). The Web site also has suggestions to
parents for augmenting the learning sections of the program using
teaching games children can play at home.

PARTIES AWASH IN `SOFT MONEY' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL KRANISH  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Four years after a presidential fund-raising
scandal led to intense criticism of the use of ``soft money,'' the
two major political parties are on track to raise twice as much of
the unregulated funds, with Al Gore working almost nightly to help
Democrats match the Republicans' trove.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of the year, the two parties are expected to raise
$500 million in soft money, according to the advocacy group Common
Cause, with at least $100 million spent on television ads that are
barely disguised campaign commercials and are targeted in key
states to help either Democrat Gore or Republican George W. Bush.
That gusher of spending in the final weeks could play a large role
in determining who wins.
</P>
<P>
   The pressure on both candidates to continue raising money was
newly evident Wednesday, when the Republican Party announced that
it had taken in another $30 million in regulated and unregulated
contributions in August. The Democratic Party declined to release a
corresponding figure, but both parties agree that Republicans are
well ahead in the race for cash, as has been the pattern in past
elections.
</P>
<P>
   The furious money-raising pace raises the question of whether
the many investigations into campaign finance _ as well as the
lengthy discussion about reform, led by Senator John McCain, during
the primaries _ has had any significant impact on the parties. The
only major difference is that the parties are taking extra care not
to raise money from illegal foreign sources, as the Democrats did
in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``They all think they can do it because President Clinton got
away with it in 1996,'' said Fred Wertheimer, president of
Democracy 21, a reform advocacy group.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Wertheimer joined with the Common Cause president,
Scott Harshbarger, in a lawsuit against the Federal Election
Commission. They allege that the Bush and Gore campaigns are
committing a massive violation of the law by raising soft money for
the parties, which in turn, they say, use the money to directly
help the campaign. The campaigns deny this, saying the candidates
are raising money for party-building.
</P>
<P>
   All of this has a direct bearing on the presidential campaign
because the two parties are preparing to use the money raised by
Bush and Gore for an onslaught of ads in ``battleground'' states in
the coming weeks. That is similar to what happened in 1996, when
the Clinton campaign allegedly worked closely with the Democratic
National Committee and state committees to place ads in key states.
</P>
<P>
   Theoretically, Bush and Gore are supposed to have exactly the
same amount of money to wage the fall campaign. That, at least, is
what Congress intended when it rewrote campaign-finance laws in
1974.
</P>
<P>
   With no fanfare, the US government recently wired $68 million
into each of the campaigns. The logic behind this transfer of
taxpayer funds is that candidates shouldn't be forced to scramble
for cash in the closing weeks of an election and shouldn't be
influenced by big contributors.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, before Bush and Gore cashed in this windfall, they were
required to sign a pledge swearing not to raise any private funds
for their campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, night after night, a campaign-within-a-campaign is taking
place. Gore is raising cash for the Democratic Party at
star-studded events, from a concert with James Taylor in Boston to
extravaganzas at Radio City Music Hall in New York City. Bush is
raising money at a slightly slower pace because the GOP is already
financially ahead. Bush and Gore routinely tell contributors that
their money could make a difference in who wins.
</P>
<P>
   It may sound like campaign money, and it may be raised like
campaign money _ but the campaigns insist it is not a direct
campaign contribution. Advocates of campaign-finance overhaul fail
to see the distinction.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no pretense any longer that they are even obeying the
spirit of the law,'' said Ellen Miller, president of the advocacy
group Public Campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Spokesmen for the candidates denied there is any violation
because the soft money doesn't go directly into the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are a regular part of the campaign schedule for all
candidates,'' Bush spokesman Ken Lysaius said, referring to the
Texas governor's frequent appearances to raise soft money.
</P>
<P>
   ``The funds raised are used in full accordance with the law for
party-building,'' Gore spokesman Doug Hattaway said, adding that
the first bill Gore would submit as president would ban soft money.
</P>
<P>
   During the primaries, Democrat Bill Bradley and McCain, a
Republican, shook hands and said that if they became the nominees,
they wouldn't raise soft money. But they lost, and Bradley last
week was a host of a Gore fund-raiser that brought in $1 million
for the Democratic Party, much of it the sort of soft money that
Bradley has criticized.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't recall presidential candidates being involved in
fund-raisers this late in the campaign,'' said Larry Makinson of
the Center for Responsive Politics, which tracks money and
campaigns. ``They usually talk mostly to human beings after Labor
Day. I have a feeling this won't stop until the weekend before the
election because it takes time for the checks to move.''
</P>
<P>
   This is, in effect, Part Two of the year's fund-raising saga.
Bush far outdid Gore in raising primary money, bringing in $104
million compared to $53 million for Gore. But after the
conventions, the campaigns switched to general election financing.
</P>
<P>
   But advocates of campaign-finance overhaul say the candidates
are effectively exceeding the $68 million in public financing by
raising tens of millions in soft money for the parties.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, according to Common Cause, the two main parties raised
$250 million in soft money. That amount is expected to be doubled
in the current election cycle, according to Harshbarger, the former
Massachusetts attorney general. As of June, the Democrats raised
$119 million and the Republicans took in $137 million in soft
money. The Republicans had an even bigger lead in regulated ``hard
money,'' raising $179 million compared to $103 million as of last
March.

JUST WONDERING: WHY DOES VW SAY IT'S OK TO BURN OIL? 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (l and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROYAL FORD  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   More from the days of miracle and wonder, once again heavy on
the wondering . . ..
</P>
<P>
   --After a letter arrived from a guy on Cape Cod wondering why
his elderly father had been told it was normal for his new
Volkswagen Jetta to burn a quart of oil every 1,000 miles, I went
looking for an answer. One public relations guy at Volkswagen,
calling me from the middle of a business trip, said that didn't
sound right. So that's what I wrote a couple of weeks back.
</P>
<P>
   Well, lo and behold, the phone calls and e-mails became deluge.
Volkswagen owners _ of Beetles, Jettas, Golfs, GTIs _ let me know
that that had been their experience as well. So what's a wondering
mind to do? Another call to Volkswagen, and this time an engineer
got on the case.
</P>
<P>
   This will come as a surprise to you, as it did to me, but
Volkswagen says that burning a quart of oil for each 1,000 miles
driven _ up to around 15,000 _ is perfectly normal. In fact, they
recommend that if you are the owner of a new Volkswagen, you check
the oil level every second filling of your gasoline tank.
</P>
<P>
   It's still not clear to me why, in this day and age, it makes
sense to build a car that burns that much oil over a long break-in
period, or even why the cars use up oil like that in the first
place. And don't get me wrong. I think VWs are some of the best
cars on the market today. But on the oil thing, we'll just have to
wonder some more until I can get a clear technical explanation.
It's not as if Volkswagen is the only company building high-rev,
powerful, small engines (Audi, VW's partner, says their cars, too,
use oil the same way during break-in, though they are not as
specific on quantity or how long it will last), but I certainly
have heard of no other cars that consume oil like this.
</P>
<P>
   Anybody out there have an answer? I'm wondering.
</P>
<P>
   --And I'm wondering, too, about just how remarkably prescient a
caption writer for a magazine called Modern Tire Dealer (you
probably don't get this one at home) was when, for the August
issue, he wrote a caption beneath a picture of an SUV with big
tires and fancy wheels. Now keep in mind that this issue came just
as the Firestone/Bridgestone/Ford tire problem was reaching its
peak.
</P>
<P>
   But right there, beneath the picture, was a caption that
proclaimed, ``The SUV wheel and tire market is exploding . . ..''
</P>
<P>
   --And speaking of shredding tires, when I wrote about the Mark
Donohue book ``The Unfair Advantage,'' last week and called him my
pick as best all-around race driver ever, I admit I held out a gem
just for this column. Again, it makes you wonder.
</P>
<P>
   Because in that book, Donohue recounts a time on a race track in
the mid-'60s when he was trying to get a Shelby Cobra in tune with
the track he was running on. He was having tire problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``. . . every time I got up on the banks I could hear a
`sq-sq-sq-sq-sq,' and I just kept thinking, `Christ, when is it
going to go?' '' He was referring to a spongy tire, which did
indeed blow. He was bucking for a permanent seat in a car at that
point so he didn't want to offend potential backers, he wrote.
</P>
<P>
   ``So when the tire blew, I didn't want to tell anybody . . .,''
he wrote. ``So I said, `Well, I ran over some glass and the tire
blew.''
</P>
<P>
   The kicker to this tale?
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't want Firestone to look bad . . .. I gave the tire to
the Firestone guys and they went and hid it, but it was shredded on
the inside.''
</P>
<P>
   Plus c'est change . . . as they say.
</P>
<P>
   --So I write reviews of big, gas-guzzling SUVs _ write them
because that's what people are buying _ and each time I get
barraged with mail from SUV-haters asking how I can be so
irresponsible as to write about these safety- and
environmentally-challenged beasts.
</P>
<P>
   Yet I write a Page One story about a batch of dedicated college
students, working in concert with General Motors to produce the
SUVs of the future _ SUVs that burn far less fuel and run far
cleaner and have added safety features _ and how much response is
there from those critics? Zero.
</P>
<P>
   --I wondered some time back about Saab and why it is lagging in
offering an all-wheel-drive vehicle. Its Viggen, a true rocket of a
car with disconcerting torque steer, seemed to me reason enough for
them to go all-wheel drive.
</P>
<P>
   Audi, which is in the midst of converting its entire line to
performance sedans and sports cars, and which builds probably the
best AWD system in the world, may just show Saab how it's done. Ah,
but is Saab already headed there?
</P>
<P>
   Take a look at the picture accompanying this column.
</P>
<P>
   That's a picture of a 9-3 Viggen, with rally driver Per Eklund
at the wheel, running the famous Adephelia Pikes Peak International
Hill Climb. He won the Open Class and finished with the second
fastest overall time of the day.
</P>
<P>
   ``The 9-3 Viggen was perfect today,'' Eklund said.
</P>
<P>
   Now look again at the photo. Notice the dirt spinning back from
the front tires as they bite? That's normal for a Saab,
front-wheel-drive rocket that it is. Now, look at the rear wheels.
What's going on here?
</P>
<P>
   Though it seems obvious, I checked out the technical specs on
Eklund's Viggen and, wouldn't you know, there was the answer:
``Transmission: four-wheel drive with programmable active
differentials.''
</P>
<P>
   Have we seen the future? I wonder.
</P>
<P>
   --I wonder, too, about some folks' choice in vanity plates. Once
in a while you see a clever one _ HOGWILD, on a
Harley-Davidson/Ford F-150 _ and some are just plan sappy, as in
IGO4U. But the ones that baffle me are the plates that people have
paid extra money for just to tell you what kind of car the plate is
attached to.
</P>
<P>
   Saw one the other day that said VOLVO. Hooked right onto, you
guessed it, a Volvo. I've seen Beemer, Chevy, and Saab3 (meaning, I
suppose, that Saab, Saab1, and Saab2 were taken).
</P>
<P>
   And my favorites in this category are the ones that proclaim
ownership. MYBMW, MYSAAB.
</P>
<P>
   What, you think we think the car was stolen? Now SWIPED, that
would show some derring-do.
</P>
<P>
   Hey, it makes you wonder.

here, ``The Empire Style and Its Conquest of Europe: 1800-1850.''
By Wendy Moonan.
</P>
<P>
   DANCE-FILM-REVIEW (Undated) _ The emerging critical line on
``Dancer in the Dark,'' by the Danish director Lars von Triar, is
that it will polarize audiences, that you'll either love it or hate
it. And while it's true that this is a film about which no one can
remain neutral, it's also true that neutrality is not the same as
ambivalence. Reviewed by A.O. Scott.

netherworld that buys and sells tickets. The scalping underworld,
and the people and organizations it does business with, received
some unwanted attention Thursday. The International Olympic

 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ When you back up a $5 million-a-year player
whose coach once put his name in the same paragraph as Lawrence
Taylor's, you know what's waiting for you. A lot of waiting around.
</P>
<P>
   All week you work, preparing yourself for a moment you know
isn't coming. If you are wise you study your playbook, repeat your
techniques, run hard in practice, and hope somebody notices.
</P>
<P>
   If you are fortunate, eventually you get a chance, although you
know it will be limited, unless disaster strikes the man in front
of you _ and nobody would wish that upon him. More to the point,
you know that when those chances come, you better do a lot with a
little if you want a little more.
</P>
<P>
   Greg Spires is used to living this way, which is perhaps why it
came as no surprise to him that he was credited with 1 1/2 sacks
last Sunday against Minnesota. He nearly had another sack until
Vikings quarterback Daunte Culpepper unleashed the ball into the
ground to avoid Spires's unexpected appearance in his face.
</P>
<P>
   This was not surprising to Spires, the third-year backup to
Willie McGinest, although it probably shocked a few of his friends.
That's because more than a few of his friends probably don't know
he's still playing football.
</P>
<P>
   In three years since arriving in New England as an undersized
defensive end (6 foot 1 inches, 270 pounds) with quickness and a
knack for getting to the quarterback, Spires has started exactly
one game. He has made a total of 33 tackles and five sacks. He has
done a lot more cheering for McGinest than he's done substituting
for him.
</P>
<P>
   Yet when McGinest pulled up lame last Sunday with a still
undefined ``leg injury,'' that the organization says has left him
``day-to-day'', Spires was ready. You might wonder how that could
be after over two years of riding the bench more regularly than
Jimy Williams, but Spires knows the secret.
</P>
<P>
   The secret is patient and the sad experience of having to master
that difficult emotion.
</P>
<P>
   ``At Florida State, I played behind a great athlete, Peter
Boulware (an All-America pass rusher now starring for the Baltimore
Ravens),'' Spires said. ``I was always a superstar on my teams up
until college. That's where all my waiting began.
</P>
<P>
   ``I learned to adapt to it there. If I hadn't had that
experience, this would be a lot more difficult. I don't like doing
it, but I understand how it is.''
</P>
<P>
   How it is, often times, is frustrating. Yet Spires learned years
ago that he could not allow his frustrations to overwhelm him
because, if he did, they would only increase as his playing time
decreased.
</P>
<P>
   And so he has taken another road, a road that led him into
Daunte Culpepper's chest twice and, he hopes, may get him into Jay
Fiedler's mug a few times in Miami this weekend if McGinest isn't
ready to play all out all the time.
</P>
<P>
   ``The role I play has a lot of pressure,'' Spires said. ``When
an opportunity comes, I have to do something with it. The time
you're in there, it's now or never because you don't get that many
chances to impress the coaches.''
</P>
<P>
   Spires began impressing coaches at Mariner High School in Cape
Coral, Fla., where he was a high school All-American. His chances
at Florida State were limited as he moved from linebacker to nose
tackle and then defensive end. He finally got his opportunity to
start his senior year after Boulware's departure and made
second-team All-Atlantic Coast Conference, despite missing three
games with a fractured fibula.
</P>
<P>
   One game they won't forget any time soon in Tallahassee was his
four-sack effort against North Carolina, which was one shy of the
Seminoles' single-game sack record.
</P>
<P>
   That game, and others like it, convinced the Patriots to take
him in the third round in 1998 (83d overall). That was 79 players
after McGinest was drafted in 1994 and that has made all the
difference. Or at least a lot of it.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since his arrival, Spires has battled coaches' doubts about
his lack of size and coaches' convictions that McGinest will one
day blossom into one of the game's best pass rushers. But more
chances for McGinest mean more pine time for Spires and more
emphasis on the few opportunities he does get to chase down guys
like Culpepper.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I have a good overall game, but a lot of people _
because of my size _ think I can't stop the run consistently,''
Spires said. ``I am short, but I get good leverage and I think I
can hold my own if I get a chance regularly. I do excel at coming
off the ball, though. I do have a good 3-yard burst and that's what
it takes to get to the quarterback.''
</P>
<P>
   That and tenacity, which is something Spires has in ample
supply. If he didn't, he'd be gone by now, lost in the mist behind
McGinest.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my situation, you've got to be patient,'' Spires said
calmly, a knowing smile on his face. ``You're not playing enough
that they really know what you can do, but they label you as a guy
who doesn't have the ability and there's nothing you can do about
that until an opportunity comes. When it does, you better take it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew last Sunday I'd get a few opportunities to rush the
quarterback. I wanted to show them I deserved a few more plays.
That's how it is in my situation. You get a few plays and try to
show you deserve a few more. If you get a few more, you try to show
that you deserve a different role for yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   If you get enough plays, guys like Greg Spires believe, you may
even go from bit parts to best supporting actor. Or maybe even a
little further than that.
</P>
<P>
   Until then you can do only two things. You can play your game
Wednesday and Thursday, when practice is most intense in the NFL
and you can do one other thing.
</P>
<P>
   You can wait in the wings . . . eagerly.

CAULK WINDOW BEFORE INSTALLING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER HOTTON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. I have many aluminum storm windows. Should they be caulked
around the edges, where they are attached to the wood casing? One
window man said no, another said yes. Who's right?
</P>
<P>
   ED LETTIC, Lancaster, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. The fellow who said the storms should be caulked is right,
but it is not a matter of caulking the edges of the storm already
on the window. If you tried that, you would get no caulking in the
joint. The caulking is done before the storm is installed. Apply a
bead of caulk to the face of the casing all around the opening.
When the storm is applied and screwed in place, it presses against
the caulking, making a neat, airtight, watertight installation.Over
time, this caulking dries out and the seal may not be ideal.You can
recaulk, but you have to remove the storm, scrape off old caulking
on both storm and frame, apply new caulking, and reinstall the
storm.

replaced, but there is a triple-rod snow fence on the roof in the
front of the house that is a mess and looks terrible, and may not
be doing what it is supposed to, keeping snow and ice from falling
off the roof. Should I take it down? I could leave part of it over
a doorway. Snow sliding off the rest of the house would not be a
hazard to any passersby.
</P>

<P>
   A. The snow fence was indeed put up there to keep snow and ice
from avalanching off the roof. You could leave part of it over a
doorway, but I think it would be better if you replaced the snow
fence the entire length of the roof. It is not worth taking the
chance that some person or pet might wander out there in winter.
The roofer can install a new one.

INSULATE AND LOWER HOME HEATING COSTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER C. HOTTON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Remember that old high school cheer we brought the house down
with? It went something like ``. . . 5, 6, 7, 8, who do we
appreciate?''
</P>
<P>
   If your name was on the end, it was very satisfying.
</P>
<P>
   Now that the frost is on the pumpkin and there's a nip in the
air, we can end that bit of doggerel with, ``Insulate, insulate,
insulate!''
</P>
<P>
   Why bother? All houses are insulated by now, you might say.
</P>
<P>
   Not so. Insulators are still busy insulating old houses that
don't have any, or adding to those that don't have enough.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, fuel prices skyrocketed last winter and show little
sign of coming down very far. Remember when your oil man asked you
to triple the last three payments of your yearly budget?
</P>
<P>
   So, cost of fuel is a great incentive to check to see if you
have any insulation, if you have enough, and if you have it in all
the right places. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Savings are worth the effort &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There are several good things about insulation. It is probably
the cheapest building material you can buy that does the most good.
The cost of insulation and installation, say $1,000, could save as
much as $300 to $500 per year in fuel costs, making a short payback
period of two to three years.
</P>
<P>
   Is there any new insulation? Not really; fiberglass and
cellulose still rule; fiberglass is used for batts and rolls and
for blowing, cellulose for blowing. Blowing is usually done in
walls, sometimes in attic floors.
</P>
<P>
   There are some variations in fiberglass insulation.
</P>
<P>
   Owens Corning (the Pink Panther people _ all their insulation is
pink) came out with its Poly-Wrap a few years ago.
</P>
<P>
   It is fiberglass wrapped in perforated polyethylene to keep the
fiberglass from sensitive hands, and to ease its installation on
old insulation. The Poly-Wrap is slippery, so it can be moved over
old insulation more easily.
</P>
<P>
   Johns Manville countered with its ComfortTherm, fiberglass
wrapped in polyethylene, with an added flange that makes it easy to
staple in place, especially on basement ceilings. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Is the insulation safe? &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There have been some reports about the safety of fiberglass and
cellulose.
</P>
<P>
   Their manufacturers say they are safe. The hazards with
fiberglass occur in the manufacturing process. But once it is
installed, secured, and undisturbed, it is safe. Cellulose is
dusty, but that too is safe once it is secured and undisturbed.
</P>
<P>
   One word of caution. If you install fiberglass or cellulose
yourself, wear a respirator and skin protection: long sleeves,
tucked-in pants, and a hat.
</P>
<P>
   What about that mysterious R factor? What does it mean?
</P>
<P>
   It is a measuring device, to measure the resistance (that is
what the ``R'' stands for) that the insulation has against the
passage of heat from a warm area to a cold one. The higher the R
number the greater the resistance to heat loss. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Casing the joint &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   So, your first priority is to see if you have any insulation.
You probably already know that, but you can check the attic floor,
the basement ceiling, and the walls. The first two are easy to
check, but how do you check the walls?
</P>
<P>
   That's easy, more or less. Take off an electric outlet cover or
switch plate, aim a flashlight into the box. If you see pink or
yellow or white cottony stuff beside and behind the box, it is
insulation (not asbestos), and chances are you don't have to do
anything with the walls.
</P>
<P>
   You may have to pull out the outlet or switch unit to make sure
of the insulation. If you do that, first pull a fuse or trip a
breaker to kill the power.
</P>
<P>
   If there is no insulation, you can have cellulose or fiberglass
blown in. It is best to have this done professionally because it
requires special equipment.
</P>
<P>
   If there is no insulation on the attic floor and none on the
basement ceiling, you can put in insulation yourself, saving a
bundle. The insulation is inexpensive. &QL; 
 &QL; 
The attic floor &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If there are floorboards in the attic, take them up, and lay in
8-inch-thick fiberglass batts with the paper backing (the backing
is the vapor barrier) down, touching the ceiling below.
</P>
<P>
   This 8-inch insulation comes up to the tops of the joists. Then
you can apply 6-inch unbacked fiberglass insulation or that
plastic-wrapped insulation on top, at right angles to the joists.
Another way to do it is to have fiberglass or cellulose blown in
the floor up to the joists, then add the fiberglass yourself.
</P>
<P>
   This will give you 14 inches of insulation, with an R factor of
48, more than enough by current standards. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Adding to what's there &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If you already have insulation in the attic floor, it could be
two, three, or six inches thick, not up to par. So, you can add to
it, bringing it up to the tops of the joists, then adding more.
</P>
<P>
   Twelve to 14 inches of insulation is considered the ultimate.
Adding more will have little additional effect.
</P>
<P>
   If you want to put back the floorboards, that is OK except you
cannot put more than eight or so inches between the joists. Well,
you can, by putting in six-inch joists (5 1/2 inches deep) at right
angles to the joists, adding more insulation and putting the boards
on top of the added joists. Or do this to just part of the attic. &QL; 
 &QL; 
The basement ceiling &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If your house is more than 10 years old, chances are good that
your basement ceiling is not insulated. Now's your chance to do it.
It's easy.
</P>
<P>
   Install six-inch fiberglass batts with the paper backing up,
touching the ceiling above. Hold the insulation in place with
hangers, pointed wires stuffed between each set of joists, 24
inches apart.
</P>
<P>
   Or, put in the Poly-Wrap or the ComfortTherm; it can be stapled
instead of hung on wires, and will provide an extra R factor
because it is two inches thicker.
</P>
<P>
   This should be done whether you live in the basement or not.
</P>
<P>
   But why bother with basement ceiling insulation? Doesn't warm
air rise, so there is little loss of heat to the basement?
</P>
<P>
   That's an old wives' tale. Warm air does rise. But in the world
of thermodynamics, the loss of heat from a warm area to a cold area
occurs in all directions: up, sideways, and down. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Knee walls and sloping ceilings &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Then there are special areas where insulation will also do good:
cathedral ceilings, sloping ceilings on the second floor of a Cape
Cod-style house, on knee walls, those short walls coming from the
floor of the second story in the Cape house to the sloping ceiling,
and the floorspace outside of the knee wall.
</P>
<P>
   You can insulate the knee wall and the floor behind it easily,
but the sloping ceiling is another matter. That is where another
type of insulation comes in, a rigid insulation: Styrofoam or
polyisocyanurate, a mouthful of a word for a modified polyurethane
foam. You will impress the insulation store clerk if you can
pronounce it, but it has other names such as High R Sheating and
Thermax.
</P>
<P>
   You may see the openings between rafters of the sloping ceiling,
if you get behind the knee wall and look above it.
</P>
<P>
   If you can see the space, you can cut the rigid insulation to
fit and slip it in place. Four inches of insulation is adequate and
will leave an airspace between insulation and roof boards,
essential for proper ventilation.
</P>
<P>
   If all that is impossible, you can take off the ceiling, put in
regular insulation, and put up a new ceiling. As impossible as that
may sound, it has been done.
</P>
<P>
   Now you're all snug and saving a bundle. But we're not through.
We have to consider vapor barriers, ventilation, doors, and
windows.
</P>
<P>
   More about that next week.

HARD NOT TO FEEL SORE AFTER LOSSES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ He was a tower of strength on the mound, his teammates
drawing inspiration from his every strikeout while a packed house
at Fenway Park rocked with renewed hope with every passing inning.
</P>
<P>
   The brilliant hue of Paxton Crawford's performance left this
bittersweet thought mixing with the scent of autumn through four
innings Wednesday night on Yawkey Way: If only Pedro Martinez could
have fared as well Wednesday as Crawford, the Red Sox would be even
with the Cleveland Indians in the American League wild-card race
this morning.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, in what probably was Martinez's last appearance in
Boston until spring, the Indians turned this day-night doubleheader
inside out while leaving New Englanders pondering the onset of
winter. The Indians squeaked past Martinez, 2-1, in the afternoon,
an unprecedented outcome that the Sox ace _ 9-0 against the Indians
until Wednesday _ seemed to accept with the same fatalism that has
afflicted Sox fans for generations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like I said,'' Martinez said, talking about Nomar
Garciaparra's ninth-inning drive in Game 1 that hit The Wall about
a foot below the point it would have been a game-tying home run,
``we weren't meant to win that game.''
</P>
<P>
   The Indians completed the sweep with a 5-4 win in the nightcap
that all but scuttled the Sox' chances, leaving them four games in
arrears in the wild-card race (five games back in the loss column)
with 11 games to go.
</P>
<P>
   Crawford, the kid from Arkansas whose life has gone from
storybook to soap opera in the last couple of months, had a 3-0
lead and two outs and nobody on in the fifth when he hit former Sox
scrub Bill Selby with a pitch.
</P>
<P>
   ``The kid was pitching really well,'' pitching coach Joe
Kerrigan said. ``He showed up, that's for sure. He didn't back down
from the situation. He went out there and attacked them.
</P>
<P>
   ``But then he went and committed a youthful mistake. Two outs
and nobody on, he hit the No. 9 hitter.''
</P>
<P>
   Four batters later, Crawford was out of the game. Kenny Lofton,
who had five hits, including a decisive home run in Game 1,
singled. Omar Vizquel walked. Roberto Alomar cracked a two-run
single, and he and Vizquel executed a double steal.
</P>
<P>
   After Manny Ramirez walked, Rheal Cormier replaced Crawford, and
the Indians then stole away whatever illusions the Sox were still
harboring about playing for a third straight October.
</P>
<P>
   Vizquel, in a bit of derring-do by a Sox opponent not seen in
Fenway Park in a dozen years, stole home on Cormier while the
lefthander had his back to third. Cormier was still in a stretch
position and preparing to throw a 2-2 pitch to Jim Thome when
Vizquel broke for home and slid across the plate safely _ without
even a throw from Cormier.
</P>
<P>
   No one in a Sox uniform, it appeared, had turned on the
Emergency Broadcasting System to alert Cormier or catcher Scott
Hatteberg that Vizquel was homeward bound.
</P>
<P>
   ``I yelled,'' said third baseman Lou Merloni, who doubled home
the Sox first two runs in the second and fourth innings of Game 2,
but grounded into a rally-killing double play in the eighth. ``But
the crowd was so loud, by the time Frenchy knew, it was too late.
It was a great play by Vizquel.''
</P>
<P>
   That run tied the score at 3, and even though Cormier would
eventually strike out Thome, the man who was at the plate while
Vizquel made off with the silverware, the china, and the
tablecloth, boos thundered across the diamond.
</P>
<P>
   The unhappiness expressed by the fans captured the temper of the
day. Sox manager Jimy Williams was ejected in the top of the eighth
in the first game when he argued an atrocious call by plate umpire
Richard Rieker, who somehow divined that Indians batter Russell
Branyan had fouled off a pitch that he missed by the length of one
of catcher Jason Varitek's shinguards.
</P>
<P>
   Then, according to an observer within earshot of the Sox dugout
and with a clear view of the proceedings, Carl Everett loudly
upbraided Williams's stand-in, bench coach Buddy Bailey, after
pinch runner Donnie Sadler made no attempt to advance after subbing
for Everett (pinch single) in the eighth inning.
</P>
<P>
   The sore-legged Everett, who has not started in the first three
games of this crucible series, had pinch hit for Darren Lewis and
stroked an opposite-field single to left with one out and the Sox
trailing, 1-0.
</P>
<P>
   In came the swift Sadler. ``Go, go, go, go, go, go,'' Everett
yelled in the Sox dugout, according to the eyewitness. ``You can't
score from first base.''
</P>
<P>
   But with Cleveland reliever Paul Shuey throwing over to first
base a couple of times, Sadler made no attempt to steal before Trot
Nixon grounded into an inning-ending double play.
</P>
<P>
   Everett was heard complaining to the other Sox coaches, Tommy
Harper and Wendell Kim, then yelled, according to the eyewitness:
``Let's win in spite of him,'' an apparent reference to Bailey.
</P>
<P>
   The frustration, of course, was understandable. Turning on one
of your own at such a time is not quite as comprehensible.
</P>
<P>
   Bailey took the high road afterward. ``If he was yelling at me,
I wasn't paying attention,'' Bailey said. ``The crowd was loud, and
I was busy with managing the game at the time.''
</P>
<P>
   Everett had the game in his own hands one more time, when he hit
for Lewis in the nightcap with two outs and a runner on in the
seventh. But Lofton ran down the liner he scorched to deep center,
just as third baseman Travis Fryman turned Merloni's smash into a
double play in the eighth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Best ball I hit all night,'' said Merloni, who gave his helmet
a two-handed slam in the Sox' final act of frustration. ``But like
I said,'' he added with a wry smile, ``the third baseman has been
playing there for years.''
</P>
<P>
   Martinez, who had thrown 123 pitches, did not go out for the
ninth inning of Game 1, down 1-0. Derek Lowe, who did, gave up a
home run to right to the first batter he faced, Lofton.
</P>
<P>
   ``The same curveball I've thrown maybe 300 times this year,''
Lowe said. ``But as soon as he hit it, I saw that it was going
out.''
</P>
<P>
   The Indians, who had never beaten Martinez, were winners on a
day they scored just one run against him. But it was typical of the
Sox' season. Fifty-five times this season, they have scored three
runs or fewer. They have won 10 of those games.
</P>
<P>
   That's not the ticket to punch if you intend to play in October.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll take my chances if I give them one run in the first
inning,'' Martinez said. ``But this was a very hard loss.''
</P>
<P>
   The kind of loss that makes you wonder what day to put up the
storm windows.

   NANTUCKET, Mass. _ This is the place that Robert P. Blum found
as a young broadcast journalist when he needed a weekend to get
away. It's the place he revisited for summer vacations, after he
had a wife and three children.
</P>
<P>
   So, when he died last year at age 67, it was the place that his
family took his ashes to have them scattered offshore.
</P>
<P>
   In the kind of service repeated often off Nantucket _ usually
with a good measure of improvisation _ the family said goodbye and
scattered the ashes from the deck of a chartered fishing boat. Now,
rather than visit a cemetery, they return to Nantucket to remember
Robert Blum.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I go to Nantucket now, I can feel his presence,'' said
his daughter, Jenna Blum, of Beacon Hill. ``It really suffuses the
whole island for me. It's very comforting.''
</P>
<P>
   On an island where so many feel connected to the sea, fishing
charters are often hired to return people to it. Numerous Nantucket
charters perform the service _ though not formal memorial services
_ with varying degrees of interest in word-of-mouth marketing.
</P>
<P>
   The owner of the Althea K, Pete Kaizer, takes families and
clergy out for $125 an hour and encourages them to bring along the
deceased's favorite music. He'll play anything ``from a symphony to
the Rolling Stones'' on the CD player on deck, and will accommodate
a request for a sunset ride.
</P>
<P>
   ``I make it a happy thing,'' said Kaizer. ``We can do a
combination of fishing and buial _ whatever you want to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Harbor Cruises, the outfit that the Blums used,
wouldn't discuss burials at sea, and Endeavor owner Sue Genthner
said she would rather discuss more pleasant events, such as
weddings.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps Genthner has a reason for reticence: There's something
unseemly about confronting death in this way, on an otherwise
celebratory island and a pleasure boat. Blum, 29, remembers how
surreal it felt, calling to inquire about charter rates. When asked
what kind of fish she was trying to catch, she would have to
explain that she was, instead, ``giving back.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There's sort of a black comedy to dealing with the mechanics
of death,'' Blum said. ``There was a grisly humor to it that I
thought my father might enjoy.''
</P>
<P>
   The family ended up spending $250 for the trip, because it was
peak fishing season, but some charters accommodate families without
a fee.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's bad karma'' to charge, said Bob DeCosta, the
captain of Albacore Charters, who was salting mackerel in an ice
cooler as he spoke. ``As much time as I spend on the water, I need
all the luck I can (get).''
</P>
<P>
   Many of the deceased whose ashes are scattered off Nantucket had
homes on the island, formed attachments to it while vacationing
here, or spent a life working as fishermen.
</P>
<P>
   Scattering ashes is usually cheaper than a formal burial, but
not all faiths endorse it. Though the Catholic church allows
cremation, it frowns upon scattering of ashes, recommending that
they be kept in an urn to honor the integrity of the body.
</P>
<P>
   Ash-scattering ceremonies also present more potential for
gaffes. Josh Eldridge, captain of Monomoy Charters, remembers
taking a family out for a service on a particularly windy day. When
the ashes were scattered, he said, a flock of seagulls ``came from
out of nowhere and started eating the ashes. The wife started
crying, the son started laughing. It's the whole point of being
buried at sea _ being recycled.''
</P>
<P>
   Another family didn't tell Eldridge they had chartered his boat
for a funeral, but toward the end of their trip, they unearthed a
small brass cannon that the deceased father had grown attached to.
Then they produced the ashes.
</P>
<P>
   The son, Eldridge said, ``shot him out of his own cannon.'' Then
they threw the cannon overboard.
</P>
<P>
   Eldridge, who has done almost 40 burials in the last few years,
said a dying man in his early 70s made his own arrangements for his
burial at sea, and set aside money for air fare, hotel rooms, and a
lavish catered party for six friends. ``He sent all his buddies out
to drink and eat and fish'' on his tab, Eldridge said. ``And at the
end of the trip, they threw him overboard.''
</P>
<P>
   Many families are more prepared to deal with the oddities that
sometimes accompany burials at sea because, unlike a burial
service, an ash-scattering typically happens months after a death.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people, by the time they get to spreading the ashes, have
already gone through the grieving process,'' DeCosta said.
</P>
<P>
   Not so for the Blum family, who took the trip just a few weeks
after traditional memorial services for Robert Blum, a former
producer for ``Good Morning America.'' The family members were
still very emotional, but the captain remained ``respectfully
unobtrusive'' as the family members emptied the urn and quietly
said their goodbyes, Jenna Blum said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a little more free-form because people invent their own
eulogies instead of the typical graveside ceremonies,'' Blum said.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, her mother produced the ashes of the family's black
lab, Booda, who had been cremated several years earlier, and dumped
them into the ocean, ``for company,'' Blum said.
</P>
<P>
   ``For an experience that could be very traumatic, I can't stress
enough how peaceful it was and how well the captain handled it,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Some captains would rather avoid the whole scenario. David
Martin, who runs the Flicka fishing boat and the Christina sailboat
at Straight Wharf, said he doesn't like such services, though he
will accommodate families. ``I strictly drive and try to stay as
far out of the way as possible,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The ceremonies vary widely, and most captains say they follow
the family's lead, and satisfy most requests.
</P>
<P>
   ``I also throw them out of a plane,'' said Kaizer. ``I'm a
pilot, too.''

AVERTING HARD-DRIVE DISASTER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HIAWATHA BRAY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   My lucky streak with hard drives finally has run out.
</P>
<P>
   In my 15 years with personal computers, I've heard countless
stories about the devastation caused by broken hard drives. And
though a thousand disks fell to the left and the right, none came
near me.
</P>
<P>
   Then in August, the drive in my Boston Globe iMac succumbed. And
in New Jersey last weekend, I replaced a dead drive in my
brother-in-law's nearly new Gateway PC. That got my attention. I've
got a lot of valuable stuff tucked away on my main home computer,
and the two hard drives inside have seen a couple of years of hard
service. So maybe I'm due for disaster.
</P>
<P>
   After all, hard drives are by far the weakest critical system in
a computer, simply because they're mechanical. Chips don't wear
out; ball bearings do.
</P>
<P>
   We think of the processor as the ``brains'' of the computer. But
our own brains would be useless if we suddenly forgot all the
things we've learned in life. That's what happens to a computer
with a dead drive.
</P>
<P>
   Seeing it happen twice in two months has made me take the
concept of data backup a little more seriously. Like practically
everyone else, I tend to let it slide. Every couple of months, I
archive my old e-mails. And after every online banking session, I
copy my financial records to a Zip disk. This puts me ahead of many
of my readers, but not by much.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the problem is the hard disk arms race. The drives keep
getting bigger _ 40 gigabytes is common now. How do you back them
up? With 1.4-megabyte floppies, it's impossible; even with
250-megabyte Zip disks, it's too much like work. Besides, those
Zips cost about $20 apiece. That's $80 per gigabyte, at a time when
you can buy a 20-gig hard drive for $150.
</P>
<P>
   You might be tempted to skip the Zip and install a second hard
drive, for use solely as a backup unit. Because hard drives swap
data far faster than Zip drives, this method will let you back up
everything in a couple of minutes. But you can remove a Zip disk
and tote it to a different computer. With dual hard drives, your
information is trapped inside a single box. A blown motherboard
could cut you off from all your data.
</P>
<P>
   You can use the Internet as a backup aid. There are services
such as Xdrive (www.xdrive.com), which allow you to store files on
a remote server. I use Xdrive as a kind of online attic. I can
stash files there, and then get at them from any Internet-connected
computer. But you can just as easily back up critical files this
way. Xdrive offers up to 100 megabytes of free storage, and you can
buy another 100 for $9.95 a month.
</P>
<P>
   Connected Corp. of Natick, Mass. (www.connected.com) offers
professional-level online backup services to Fortune 500 companies,
but it also has a service for home users. For $14.95 a month, you
get all the backup you want, with no storage limits. And you can
command your computer to run backups automatically at, say, 3 a.m.
This looks like a decent deal for people with high-speed Internet
access. But it's not much help for those of us with 10 gigabytes of
data and a 56-kilobit phone modem.
</P>
<P>
   Thank heaven for cheap CD burners. You can get a decent one for
around $200, and they're on the verge of becoming standard
equipment on new home computers. The blank disks cost less than $2
and hold up to 650 megabytes of data. That makes a burner the best
backup option for home users right now.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, you can use a CD burner to produce the ultimate data
backup: a disk image. That's where you create a perfect copy of
your entire drive. Say your hard drive craps out. If you've only
got a regular backup, you'll have to install the operating system
on your new drive, and individually reinstall each program. With an
image, you can restore easily the operating system and everything
else to its previous state.
</P>
<P>
   Spurred by fear of the ultimate data disaster, I recently
purchased Symantec Corp.'s Norton Ghost 2001, a $70 program that
can shoot disk images and burn them to CDs. It hasn't been a total
success _ my rescue CD refuses to boot. The Symantec people say
it's a problem that crops up in a handful of cases. Anyway, I can
boot my PC with a floppy, then use my image CD to put everything
back as it was.
</P>
<P>
   Not only am I safe from disk crashes, but I can indulge my urge
to install buggy, experimental software. Let the bad code wreck my
entire system; I can easily put it right. The power of disk imaging
seems almost magical _ magic being a perfectly adequate substitute
for luck.

BOOK OFFERS SOME PROFOUND `LISTS TO LIVE BY' 
</HEADLINE>
   (Religion Commentary) 
 &HT;    
 &HT;    
 &HT;    (The following ``separate buy'' article is available from the
New York Times Syndicate. Please contact syndicate sales
representative DEBRA WEYDERT at 732-390-4480)
 &HT;    
 &HT;    
 By MIKE McMANUS  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    
 &HT;    
 &HT;    PORTLAND, Ore. _ Dr. Steve Stephens is a psychologist, a
Portland Christian radio-show host, and author of two books that
caught my eye last week.
 &HT;    The first is titled ''Lists To Live By: For Everything That
Really Matters.'' The lists were compiled from many sources by
Stephens, Alice Gray and John Van Diest. It did not sound
particularly compelling until I began to read them.
 &HT;    For example, on the wall of a concentration camp were found
three sentences:
 &HT;    ''I believe in the sun even when it does not shine.
 &HT;    ''I believe in love even when it isn't shown.
 &HT;    ''I believe in God even when he doesn't speak.''
 &HT;    St. Paul wrote to the Philippians that they should let their
minds dwell on these eight things: ''Whatever is true, whatever is
noble, whatever is right, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely,
whatever is admirable, whatever is excellent, whatever is
praiseworthy.''
 &HT;    Most of the lists are longer. Often I will quote only an item or
two from each to whet your appetite for more. For example, Theodore
Roosevelt wrote ''10 Reasons for Going to Church'' for Ladies Home
Journal in 1917. He said church attendance cultivates ''the habit
of feeling some responsibility for others and the sense of braced
moral strength which prevents a relaxation of one's own moral
fiber.''
 &HT;    Here are two of 20 questions you can use to strike up a
conversation with a child:
 &HT;    ''What makes you laugh? Has there ever been a time when you were
proud of yourself?''
 &HT;    How can you stay young while growing old? Five of 15 items:
 &HT;    ''Applaud others. Exercise daily. Play with children. Take
risks. Give generously.''
 &HT;    An unknown author offered 12 sure-fire ways to raise delinquent
children. The first:
 &HT;    ''Begin from infancy to give the child everything he wants. In
this way, he will grow up to believe the world owes him a living.''
 &HT;    Another unknown author suggested six wise steps to successful
communication, that can be remembered using the word LADDER:
 &HT;    Look at the person speaking to you. Ask questions. Don't
interrupt. Don't change the subject. Empathize. Respond verbally
and nonverbally.
 &HT;    At the end of the Civil War this prayer was found folded up in
the pocket of a Confederate soldier: ''I asked God for strength
that I might achieve; I was made weak that I might learn humbly to
obey.''
 &HT;    ''I asked for health that I might do greater things; I was given
infirmity that I might do better things.
 &HT;    ''I asked for riches that I might be happy; I was given poverty
that I might be wise.
 &HT;    ''I asked for power that I might have the praise of men. I was
given weakness that I might feel the need for God.
 &HT;    ''I asked for all things that I might enjoy life; I was given
life that I might enjoy all things.
 &HT;    ''I got nothing I asked for, but everything I hoped for. Almost
despite myself, my unspoken prayers were answered.
 &HT;    ''I am among men, most richly blessed.''
 &HT;    The Prevention Index lists 21 factors for a long and healthy
life. The most important:
 &HT;    ''Not smoking. Not smoking in bed if you do smoke. Wearing your
seat belts.''
 &HT;    Columnist Abigail Van Buren offers four ways to grow old
gracefully:
 &HT;    ''Fear less; hope more. Eat less; chew more. Talk less; say
more. Hate less, love more.''
 &HT;    Mother Teresa asked to be delivered from 16 things, three of
which are
 &HT;    ''Deliver me...From the desire of being loved.
 &HT;    ''From the desire of being extolled.
 &HT;    ''From the desire of being honored.''
 &HT;    Stephens' other book, ''Understanding the One You Love: 101
Questions to Strengthen Your Marriage,'' is similarly succinctly
written and very provocative. The slender paperback is designed to
help couples add spark to their times together. Each question has a
series of follow-up questions, which my wife and I used fruitfully
last weekend. Ask your spouse:
 &HT;    ''What is romantic to you? The most romantic song, movie, place,
perfume, flower, book?
 &HT;    ''What is the nicest thing I've ever said to you? What was your
response? What was the nicest thing you've ever said to me? What
motivated you to say it?
 &HT;    ''What have I done that has upset you the most? What have you
done to resolve it? What have I done to resolve it? What have you
done that has upset me the most?
 &HT;    This little volume added spice to our romantic get-away weekend
to the rose-laced Victoria, British Columbia.

MERCEDES CL500: CLEAN LINES, CLEAN RIDE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (l and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROYAL FORD  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   There was a time when, if you played a word association game
using automobiles, the cue would be ``tank'' and an appropriate
response would be ``Mercedes-Benz.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, that answer could be challenged, because what
tank-builder, after all, would shroud their best machine in
plastic, aluminum, and mangesium and use good-ol' hard steel only
at its skeleton?
</P>
<P>
   That's just what Mercedes has done with the CL500 Coupe, a
much-lighter-than-predecessor (by about a quarter of a ton) wedge
of luxury performance that would fit nicely in the garage with a
Porsche 911 or Jaguar XKR. And if you can afford any of the last
two, you can certainly pony up the $90,000 to add the CL500 to your
stable.
</P>
<P>
   From the outside, it is a very pretty automobile. Distinctive
Mercedes grille tops a three-opening fascia that has intricate
fenced meshwork that harkens back to early '60s sports car. Its
lines are clean, kept wonderfully so by the absence of a center
pillar, giving the four-seater the look of something smaller and
snappier.
</P>
<P>
   Beneath the hood beats a 5.0-liter, SOHC, 24-valve V8 that
quietly thumps out 302 horsepower and an impressive 339 lb.-ft. of
torque. It's plenty of power for a car that weighs just over two
tons. Mercedes kept the weight down by building the CL500 in an
intricate weave of plastic front fenders and trunk lid, aluminum
roof, rear fenders, and hood, and magnesium inner doors. Try
explaining that one to the auto body guy with the hammer at ACME
Bump and Grind.
</P>
<P>
   You begin looking at this car at just over $85,000, and for that
you get such amenities as automatic climate control; leather
upholstery; wood trim; infrared glass; a 10-speaker sound system;
navigation system; heated, 14-way power seats; and airbags all
about you, front, side, and curtain.
</P>
<P>
   You roll up to 90 grand when you toss in climate comfort seats
(besides heating your butt, they'll move cool air through
perforated leather to cool it), an electric rear window shade, and
air-pulse contour seats that will massage your lumbar. Oh, and
you'll also pay a $1,000 gas-guzzler tax. I got just over 17 miles
per gallon in 10 days in the CL500.
</P>
<P>
   For this, you get great comfort. Four passengers, four leather
buckets. Great head- and legroom. The front seats slide forward on
automatic power to make getting in and out of the rear easier.
Storage is everywhere _ in the doors, in the center console, in
pouches behind the seats, in covered bins beneath the front seats.
</P>
<P>
   The only interior complaint I have with the CL500 is the
complicated set of climate/sound/navigation controls at center
dash. There are myriad buttons, many looking alike, making them
hard to figure out, especially while rolling. The navigation system
is complicated beyond necessity. And while I know you are not
supposed to program this system while driving because your eyes
should not be on that center screen, it was disconcerting to have
to watch the screen if I wanted to manually set, digit by digit,
the call numbers of a radio station I wanted while driving.
</P>
<P>
   That's something that needs cleaning up.
</P>
<P>
   What was absolutely crisp and clean was the ride and handling of
this car. It's got the usual goodies: ABS, vented discs, gas
shocks. But at its heart is a state-of-the-art Active Body Control
system.
</P>
<P>
   In basic terms, here's how it works. At each wheel there are
hydraulic cylinders that answer to a sensor. The cylinders can
apply downward pressure at each wheel as weight shifts. Say you
stomp on the brakes at high speed. The car wants to nose-dive as
weight hurtles forward. The front cylinders are pressurized, the
rear cylinders relaxed, and the car remains flat.
</P>
<P>
   To try this out, get down on your hands, knees bent. Put hard
pressure down on your hands even as you stiffen your elbows and let
weight flow back to your knees. That's ABC. It also works side to
side, applying pressure to the front and rear wheels on the outside
of a turn.
</P>
<P>
   And you can feel it. This car can be stomped to a stop or rolled
very fast even into a down-sloping corner, and it balances itself.
The ABC works in addition to the gas shocks, and in comfort mode,
as opposed to sport mode (ABC at work), it has the softness of a
cross-country sedan.
</P>
<P>
   Yet even in comfort mode, where it is soft and straight on the
highway, it holds flat in corners, able to handle all the power the
engine cranks out.
</P>
<P>
   That notion may get tested, however, for the 2001 model year.
That's when the CL600 hits the market. That car will have more than
360-horsepower, produced by a sequential V6-V12 engine that
promises to test some limits.
</P>
<P>
   Nice Touch:
</P>
<P>
   --The vents at the rear of the solid sunroof (which closes
beneath a tinted glass sunroof). When the car is hot and you want
to cool it quickly without exposing your head to the sun, you open
the glass roof, close the solid roof, and let the fans push the hot
air out through the vents.
</P>
<P>
   Annoyance:
</P>
<P>
   --Can someone tell me why, oh why, even in a $90,000 car, the
Germans seem incapable of building an AM radio that does not
crackle and buzz once you are but a few miles from a broadcast
source?

TALK-SHOW CAMPAIGNERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK JURKOWITZ  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   George W. Bush's Tuesday TV chat with Oprah Winfrey created a
monster media buzz. The story and a photo of a relaxed Bush
bantering with the talk host made Page 1 of The New York Times
while pundits speculated feverishly about the political value of
the buss he planted firmly on her cheek.
</P>
<P>
   It's a busy week for the candidates humanizing themselves on the
TV chatter circuit. For Bush, it's Winfrey and Regis Philbin, while
Al Gore, fresh off his Winfrey appearance, yukked it up with Jay
Leno. Ever since Bill Clinton donned a pair of shades and blasted
out ``Heartbreak Hotel'' on the sax with Arsenio Hall in 1992, it's
pretty much ``de rigueur,'' in the words of TV historian Alex
McNeil, for politicians to expose their lighter side in pop culture
venues. It's also considered to be a reasonably low-risk way to
score political points.
</P>
<P>
   But at least one analyst says that in the longer run,
politicians and the body politic pay a price for this
harmless-looking exercise. Larry Sabato, author of ``Peep Show:
Media and Politics in the Age of Scandal,'' thinks politicians'
efforts to use the media to transform themselves into just plain
folk ``shrinks them'' and the office they seek.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was growing up, we revered the presidency. We wanted
them to be on a pedestal. It was an office that was always
respected,'' he says. ``These candidates . . . have lowered
themselves to the point where they'll never be on a pedestal . . .
and you better believe that matters in governing.''
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, some of these experiments have been clinkers.
Clinton might have looked cool with Arsenio, but probably regretted
telling MTV he preferred briefs to boxer shorts. McNeil recalls a
surprisingly engaging Richard Nixon on Jack Paar's talk show in the
early '60s, but his 1968 appearance on ``Laugh In'' was off kilter
and goofy.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Sabato's is a minority view. ``I'm for any way that isn't
demeaning that gets politics into the popular culture,'' says Craig
Crawford, editor of The Hotline political newsletter. ``I think we
can learn more about a candidate in an hour on Oprah than during an
angry press conference.''
</P>
<P>
   McNeil says chats with Winfrey or Leno simply reflect the
reality of a changing media culture since ``you gotta go where your
voters are, and your voters aren't reading the newspaper now and
they're not watching the network news.'' But CNN senior analyst
William Schneider notes that if appearances on shows like Winfrey's
work, ``it works among a tiny number of people'' who may not be
regular voters. As to Sabato's concern, Schneider says candidates
``are only worried about winning. They don't worry about
diminishing the presidency.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Media bias perceived
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A new survey taken for Editor &AMP; Publisher magazine indicates
that the perception of media bias _ particularly among Republicans
_ is alive and well. The September survey of nearly 2,000 adults
found that almost 40 percent of the voters believe their newspaper
has exhibited favoritism toward one of the presidential contenders,
with Bush supporters far more inclined to cry foul. More than half
of them believe the media are biased and of that group, about 80
percent feel Gore has been the beneficiary of friendlier converage.
Conversely, only about 30 percent of the Gore backers alleged media

   Editor &AMP; Publisher features editor Greg Mitchell thinks the
results suggest a ``blame the messenger'' response to Gore's big
bounce. ``In my opinion, I would tend to support those who thought
that Gore got gored pre-convention, and since then, he's gotten a
sunnier spin,'' he adds. Now, ``the polls are even and the coverage
should be even. Everyone's had their day.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked to name their key source of campaign news, 25 percent of
the respondents selected cable TV, 23 percent said newspapers, and
only 19 percent said network news, another clear indicator of
network television's dramatically waning impact.

   In a case of synergy too good to be true, the Oct. 12 Rolling
Stone magazine features expansive coverage of Cameron Crowe's new
movie, ``Almost Famous,'' which is based on his experiences as a
teen Rolling Stone writer chronicling the wondrous world of '70s
rock 'n' roll. But Crowe fashioned a morality tale about the
conflict between the pure passion that drove that music and the
bean counters who soon arrived to corporatize the industry. On that
score, Rolling Stone doesn't fare so well.
</P>
<P>
   In one scene, members of the fictitious band Stillwater
celebrate the news that their scruffy visages will grace the
magazine's cover by breaking into a rowdy version of ``On the Cover
of the Rolling Stone.'' Here's the roster of those who make the
cover these days: Bare-chested actor Keanu Reeves; barely
bikini-clad supermodel Gisele; pop Lolitas Britney Spears and
Christina Aguilera in a spirited competition to bare the most
midriff; and teen hearthrob actress Sarah Michelle Geller.
</P>
<P>
   The irony of Crowe's cinematic longing for lost days of
innocence seems lost on the editors who chose to hype the movie
with its current version of the cover of Rolling Stone, a
come-hither shot of the movie's half-clothed star, Kate Hudson.

LINDSAY ANDERSON, QUIPS AND ALL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRUCE MCCABE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
Mainly About Lindsay Anderson 
By Gavin Lambert 
Knopf, 369 pp., illustrated, $29.95 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The late Lindsay Anderson was among the most original of British
filmmakers. His best movies _ ``This Sporting Life,'' ``If . . .''
``O Lucky Man!'' _ do, as Gavin Lambert writes, ``move freely
between the real and surreal world.'' Anderson was also a
documentarian and stage director of note, and a close friend of
Lambert's for more than 50 years.
</P>
<P>
   In this book about Anderson, Lambert displays the strengths and
weaknesses of their relationship and of their relationships with
others. To name just one complicating factor: Both men were gay at
a time when practicing homosexual sex was a criminal act in
England. The agonies of being compelled to be furtive about sexual
preferences are described in the book. But the deception had its
comic side, too: The best anecdote recounts the marriage of actress
Janet Gaynor to the hairdresser Adrian, a match decreed by the
studio to discourage speculation that Gaynor was a lesbian. Gaynor
not only married Adrian but managed to get pregnant, only to suffer
an apparent miscarriage. When Adrian was informed, he said, ``Oh,
don't tell me I have to go through all that again.''
</P>
<P>
   The biography should be a hit with cineastes, particularly
enthusiasts of the congenially overlapping British film, theater,
television scene in the '60s. The book was inspired by the approach
Anderson himself took to his study of director John Ford _ a volume
that, Lambert writes, was ``really about the two of them.'' This
book is also informed by Anderson's diaries, his extensive files,
and letters between the two friends. It begins as a memoir, as
Lambert writes, and then ``passes through the flow of biography.''
</P>
<P>
   It's not, however, a brisk read. At times, Lambert seems to have
been intimidated by the volume of documentary material he had
access to; he becomes overly scrupulous about linearity and about
sometimes less than compelling detail. In the context of Anderson's
life and career in films and theater, we don't really need a
two-page account of his work on a short film about Poland that was
never distributed commercially outside the country.
</P>
<P>
   Especially since Lambert gives the same amount of space to a
considerably more interesting episode in Anderson's life.
Anderson's brother lived in India, with his wife and their two
children, but visited Anderson in London in summer 1964. As they
prepared to return to India, the wife ``became hysterical'' at the
last minute and refused to accompany her husband or let him take
the children with him. He returned to India alone. For two years,
Anderson essentially supported his in-laws, who simply stayed in
his flat.
</P>
<P>
   Still, we read memoirs like Lambert's for their
behind-the-scenes images, quips, and anecdotes _ all the stuff that
seems more authentic than what we see on stage and screen. And
Lambert supplies wonderful one-liners. He quotes George Bernard
Shaw on the obsession that equates homosexuality with moral
infirmity: ``A dishonored check is a safer index to character.'' He
calls sex-symbol actress Diana Dors ``the only genuine primitive in
the British cinema'' of her time. He recalls Anderson describing
director Tony Richardson as ``too busy to be instrospective,'' and
actress Carol Channing ``a prisoner of her own myth . . . no longer
an actress but an act.'' And he remembers Anderson, during one
stint as a critic, venting his spleen on newspaper reviewers like
the (anonymous) staffer at The Times of London who hailed one
dreary film in these words: ``cinema as cinema should be . . .
warm, vague, extravagant, and sentimental.''
</P>
<P>
   Lambert's memoir/biography is none of those things.

STOVE-TOP GRILLES ARE EASY TO USE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ADAM PERTMAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   You really don't have the time to read this. Then again, I
really don't have the time to write it. Which is precisely the
point.
</P>
<P>
   Between our jobs, families, bills, errands (and, of course, our
e-mails), it's a minor miracle some people have time to eat at all.
It's certainly easy to understand why so many of us rely on
fast-food restaurants, prepackaged meals, and expensive, yuppified
takeout cuisine for our daily nourishment.
</P>
<P>
   The trend away from daily home cooking (especially dinner, but
other meals as well) is more than a bit ironic, given the soaring
interest nationwide in television cooking shows. It seems we enjoy
the fantasy of food preparation, and presumably of eating the final
products, but we can't seem to face the reality of doing what it
takes to get them.
</P>
<P>
   It's too bad, because meals that taste far better than anything
you can buy from a drive-by window can be surprisingly quick and
easy to make, sometimes nearly as quick and easy as pulling a
pseudo-healthy, almost-delicious, not-really-full-course dinner out
of the freezer.
</P>
<P>
   This much is sure: With the smallest bit of practice and the
right equipment, almost anyone can learn to prepare flavorful food
with ease, with far more control over calories and ingredients than
the stuff that comes from fried-chicken and hamburger joints, and,
invariably, at far lower cost than any alternative other than
having a generous friend take you out to dinner.
</P>
<P>
   To paraphrase the most famous chef in America, Emeril Lagasse:
This ain't gonna be rocket science.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Lagasse's often-complex preparations, however, this also
ain't gonna be intimidating.
</P>
<P>
   Every component here is available at your local supermarket, and
each dish contains a maximum of five ingredients. In addition, I'm
including one or more variations so you can develop a feel for how
to repeat the basic process over and over without getting bored
with the final result.
</P>
<P>
   I also like kitchen gadgets and devices that make cooking
quicker, easier, healthier, or all of the above. Stove-top grills,
for example, are available in many shapes and sizes at just about
any department or kitchen store, many supermarkets, and even some
hardware stores. My favorite is the large, cast-iron type that fits
over two burners. It's the most versatile because it's smooth on
one side and ribbed on the other and is large enough to accommodate
lots of food at once.
</P>
<P>
   Today's meal will consist of chicken quesadillas with roasted
red peppers, spinach, and cheddar cheese; Mexican-style rice; and a
tossed salad. You decide on the salad ingredients yourself. If you
don't mind tearing lettuce and slicing vegetables, go to town. If
time is really of the essence or you're trying this experiment with
resentment and trepidation, buy a bag full of greens and pour on
your favorite dressing.
</P>
<P>
   The rice is equally simple: Follow the box directions, but use
canned chicken stock or vegetable stock (low-salt if you like)
instead of plain water and, after it's finished, stir in some
chopped parsley, cilantro, or both; a pinch or two of cumin, chile
powder, ceyene pepper, or a mix of all of them. Or toss the rice
with your favorite jarred salsa. If you decide to have plain white
rice, that's okay, too. Total work time: two to four minutes, and
you can do any chopping while the rice is cooking.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, for the main course, try the following recipe.
</P>
<P>
   You almost can't do it wrong. With a little practice, a meal
like this won't take you more than 20 or 25 minutes to make.
However complicated it all may sound if you're a kitchen klutz, the
first time you do it (okay, maybe the second), it will feel
therapeutic and satisfying. If you're still compelled to carry
something in, or don't think a meal's complete without a component
from the freezer, have ice cream for dessert.
</P>
<P>
   Now for the variations:
</P>
<P>
   For an Italian version of the quesadillas, use dried or chopped
fresh basil or oregano instead of the cilantro, and substitute
mozzarella and/or parmesan cheese for the cheddar.
</P>
<P>
   For a Mediterranean rendition, add chopped, sun-dried tomatoes
and use crumbled feta as the cheese.
</P>
<P>
   To get really jazzy, try fresh arugula or watercress (no need to
wilt in boiling water) instead of the spinach, use grilled shrimp
or crab meat instead of chicken, and goat cheese instead of
cheddar.

PUDDING WAR MAKES FOR A MESSY SUIT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALEX BEAM  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Like red meat? Then you'll love the mad stew of litigation that
has bubbled up in the wake of Harvard's declared intention to take
over the Hasty Pudding building at 10 Holyoke Street.
</P>
<P>
   The building's only commercial tenant, the Upstairs at the
Pudding restaurant, received a Notice to Quit the premises from the
Hasty Pudding Club on Sept. 1 (as expected; this space, Aug. 9).
While trying to mount a letter-writing campaign on their own
behalf, restaurant owners Mary-Catherine Deibel and Deborah Hughes
simultaneously filed suit against the five trustees _ one of them
dead _ who own the property on Harvard's behalf. The landlord is
(was) the Hasty Pudding Trust, itself a creation of the Hasty
Pudding Club-Institute of 1770. The Institute comprises the famous
transvestite theatrical company and a hard-drinking social club.
But the ground underneath the building is actually owned by two
Goodwin Proctor &AMP; Hoar lawyers working for the World's Greatest
University, and they are named in the lawsuit. Confused? Who
wouldn't be.
</P>
<P>
   With the Pudding Trust owing them mucho back rent, Harvard's
Faculty of Arts and Sciences had planned to occupy and renovate 10
Holyoke starting this month. But that scheme is on hold pending the
outcome of the lawsuit. Upstairs lawyer William Cowin, of Friedman
and Atherton, says, ``the lawsuit was not filed to declare war. Did
we believe it would help get people's attention in the
negotiations? Sure.'' WGU and the restaurant are talking about
finding a new site in the Harvard Square area _ possibly on Harvard
land. But that's easier said than done. And sometimes it's hard to
talk while the lawyers shout in the background.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;

<P>
   Shhhhhh. . . .

<P>
   The geniuses at WGBH have a hit on their hands, but they don't
want you to know about it. The cult Australian comedy series ``The
Games'' has been airing since Labor Day after Emily Rooney's local
news show _ but it's had zilch promotion. ``The Games,'' which
pokes fun at the legions of scalawag/profiteers who descended on
Sydney as soon as Australia got the Olympics, ran for two years
Down Under. One of the show's broader gags, about a running track
that was built several yards short, proved all too real when
organizers discovered that the triathlon course was 2 kilometers
short. It's OK now.
</P>
<P>
   So let me get this straight: A hilarious, Australian
``mockumentary'' of the worst-produced, lowest-rated Olympics in
recent memory and 'GBH doesn't call a reporter, or take out an ad
to promote it? ``We were promoting the dying series,'' a
spokeswoman told me, referring to Bill Moyers's cheery, four-part
meditation on the land of shadows, ``On Our Own Terms: Moyers on
Dying.'' Earth to Western Avenue: The Olympics are on! Station
officials say they might rebroadcast the series later in the year,
when viewer interest in the Sydney Olympics approaches absolute
zero.

<P>

Take it Back, II

</P>
<P>
   My campaign of harassment and intimidation directed against
Sports Illustrated, which published a blatantly false cover story
on March 27 of this year (``Why the Red Sox Will Win the World
Series _ Really!'') continues. Last week, I duped an SI spokesman
into admitting that the Red Sox were already out of wild card
contention, although he brushed aside my demand for a cover-length
retraction article.
</P>
<P>
   Now Tom Verducci, author of the doubtless well-intentioned but
tragically flawed article, has weighed in: ``Fatalistic, huh? Last
time I checked the Sox still had (four) games with Cleveland at
home and another two weeks left to the season. That out of it?
Listen, things don't look good for the Sawx the way they're
hitting. The swan boats at the at the commons have more power. But
I'm not bailing just yet. (Check back in another three days,
though.) I'll be happy to discuss the March 27 story when all
mathematical possibilities are exhausted.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The swan boats at the commons?'' Does he mean the Public
Garden? Or the Boston Common, perhaps? Has Tom ever been to Boston?
Was this article fact-checked? More to come. . .

SPRING STYLES FEATURE BARE SKIN, CLINGING FABRICS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TINA CASSIDY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Spring. When a designer's fancy turns to . . . sex.
</P>
<P>
   Get ladylike dressing out of the way this fall and brace
yourself for harder-edged clothes half a year from now. There will
be cleavage, body-clinging fabrics, leather, very short skirts,
sequins, gold lame, and chain belts. Even denim will shine,
courtesy of sparkly threads woven through the fabric.
</P>
<P>
   All of this has a heavy '80s overtone, both subtle and bold.
Wrap dresses, overwrought accessories, and strong colors will
reflect punk and disco themes.
</P>
<P>
   Ralph Lauren, who described his simple show in a downtown studio
Wednesday as ``sexy, strong, feminine, and young,'' featured liquid
silks, supple white leather, and body-defining belts. Meanwhile,
Randolph Duke draped models in glimmering fabrics, iridescent
organza pleated dresses, and silver mesh with swooping necklines.
Despite a more feminine edge, his alluring clothes still reeked of
sex appeal.
</P>
<P>
   A white, single-shouldered bodysuit (worn with nothing but spike
heels) was gathered and flecked with glitter; it was so bold that
``Sex and the City'' star Kim Cattrall mouthed ``Wow!'' from the
front row.
</P>
<P>
   The sexy theme, with a retro bent, was evident Tuesday as well,
when the drama wasn't all on the runway.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, 9:45 a.m. _ Bleary-eyed fashionistas wobbling on their
heels slowly filed into the main tent at Bryant Park and grabbed
their complimentary bottles of Evian before heading into the Girls
Rule! show, where a handful of designers sent variations of
prom-queen-meets-punk-rock down the runway. The shows were heavy on
denim and such '80s accessories as double gold lame belts and silk
lapel flowers, worn on necks or wrists. Also spotted: ankle socks
with stilettos, which many other designers would include in their
shows throughout the week.
</P>
<P>
   10:15 a.m. _ A finely groomed older gentleman paraded by the
Girls Rule! entrance with his finely groomed black standard poodle;
one might wonder whether they reserve seats for canines at these
events. Lavender and camel color combinations abounded among those
who have come to see _ and be seen.
</P>
<P>
   11 a.m. _ The crowd included actress Ally Sheedy, looking very
anti-``St. Elmo's Fire'' in black satin embroidered pants as she
sashayed into the Oscar de la Renta show one tent over. Patricia
Field, a retailer and one-half of a costume-design duo for HBO's
``Sex and the City,'' stood idly by Oscar's check-in table as
someone scrambled through a stack of paper looking for a seat for
her. Field, whose hair is dyed the same red as Ronald McDonald's,
is arguably the most influential fashion trend setter around,
thanks to the popularity of the show. They found her a seat.
</P>
<P>
   4:40 p.m. _ The stakes are high not only for the fashion
designers, but for the photographers camped out at the end of the
runway. So it was not surprising to see tempers flare before the
start of the sophisticated Lloyd Klein show. One cameraman
repeatedly called out to a woman in the front row of the narrow
exhibition space under a dripping Bryant Park tent. ``Uncross your
legs, please,'' he shouted. No response. ``Lady with the pointy
shoes! Uncross your legs!'' Which she did, giving him a clearer
shot of the runway.
</P>
<P>
   As simple French music morphed into disco, Klein sent out
elegant pantsuits in shockingly bright colors _ including a pink
similar to the Mr. Bubble box _ with plunging necklines and wide
belts, yet another '80s reference for spring. As if cleavage
weren't enough, Klein also sliced slits all the way up the back of
his evening dresses and skirts, exposing models' rear ends.
</P>
<P>
   5:35 p.m. _ Patricia Field and Rebecca Weinberg-Field (the other
half of the ``Sex and the City'' costume team, who added Patricia's
last name after so many people began calling the fashion duo the
``Field sisters'') took their seats at the Vivienne Tam show and
said they were also scoping fashions for a new Fox TV show called
``The Street.''
</P>
<P>
   Tam sent out sequined cocktail dresses with plunging necklines
and lots of form-fitting leather bottoms paired with airy blouses.
The verdict from Weinberg-Field: ``Sexy.''
</P>
<P>
   6:35 _ The mediocre Nicole Miller show was notable only for
consistently displaying sparkly black ankle socks with purple
metallic strappy sandals and giving prominence to sagging gold
chain belts. Skirts were micro-minis and there was plenty of gold
lame.
</P>
<P>
   7 p.m. _ Pandemonium outside the Betsey Johnson show as a
star-studded crowd (Steven Tyler, Cyndi Lauper, Destiny's Child)
elbowed past security to claim their seats at one of the most
talked-about shows of the week. A British woman, fed up with losing
her place in line to the more aggressive New Yorkers, scolded a man
for jumping ahead of her. ``That was naughty!'' she hissed.
</P>
<P>
   The show, featuring real-life Playboy bunnies as models, was
naughtier.
</P>
<P>
   7:35 p.m. _ January Playmate Victoria Silvstedt, her bosom and
blond hair overflowing, made the crowd roar with pleasure as she
strutted down the runway in a pink iced sequin bunny suit. With
ears, cotton tail, and all. Many of Johnson's fashions looked more
like lingerie than clothing, as if she designed these numbers with
Playmates in mind. There was even a tiny pink sequined bikini with
ruffles on the seat.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd, the men especially, did not seem to mind. As the
models passed each other on the runway, they blew each other
kisses, gave each other high-fives, fluffed their hair, or paused
to get down to the music. One surgically endowed model lost control
of her deep V top, giving the audience an unexpected peep.
</P>
<P>
   And, oh yes, there were some clothes on display, including a
Marilyn Monroe-style red satin halter dress with a large flower at
the waist, poufy sundresses with sweetheart necklines and full
skirts reminiscent of the 1950s, as well as polyester wrap dresses
from the disco era. Johnson added matching clutch purses to finish
the look.
</P>
<P>
   After all that, a bow from the designer would have been too
pedestrian. So Johnson exuberantly cartwheeled down the runway.
</P>
<P>
   9 p.m. _ The atmosphere was more restrained at Manolo Blahnik's
book-signing party at Barney's, where David Bowie and Iman mixed
with Vogue editor Anna Wintour, actor Rupert Everett, and
20-somethings sipping champagne wearing head-to-pointy-toe Chanel.
</P>
<P>
   But it was difficult to miss Blahnik, whose sexy shoes have a
cultlike following. Standing amid the cosmetic and jewelry
counters, Blahnik wore red-lipstick leather slippers with his
sedate black suit and purple tie.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about his unusual footwear, Blahnik said: ``They're mine,
of course. But 20 years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Just like everything else at Fashion Week.

OLD FURS CAN COME BACK TO LIFE AS SOMETHING USEFUL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DOREEN IUDICA VIGUE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   GROTON, Mass. _ Problem: Grandmother left you her treasured fur
coat, but it's not your style. Still, it has so much sentimental
value, you can't part with it.
</P>
<P>
   Solution: Turn that stole into a stool. Or a pillow, neckroll,
or throw.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Beth Hayes runs Transfurmation from a back room in her tidy
Main Street apartment here, recycling forgotten furs into glamorous
home accessories.
</P>
<P>
   Hayes haunts vintage and thrift shops for outdated mink, beaver,
fox, raccoon, and Persian lamb coats, stoles, and wraps, then
carefully takes them apart. Using an antique sewing machine, she
gives them new life as lush toss pillows and luxe footstools.
</P>
<P>
   She will also custom-design accessories using coats brought in
by customers, and makes about 300 per year. No rabbit fur, please,
it falls apart too easily. And, mink is not recommended for
footstools because it gets matted down too eaily. Hayes charges
between $75 and $500 for pillows, depending on the fur quality and
size, and $150 to $175 for fur-topped footstools with walnut,
hickory, and mahogany frames.
</P>
<P>
   Even the backings of the cotton-filled pillows are plush, done
in velveteen, silk from vintage kimonos, or vintage satin coat
linings. Some are edged in rope trim or tassel fringe, tiny beads,
or shiny sequins. She sends some furs, such as minks to be used for
neckrolls, to New York to be professionally sheared, which makes
the fur outrageously soft.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every day I wake up and think, `What beautiful thing am I
going to make today?' '' said Hayes, 43, who started her business
in 1996 and now sells to local specialty shops and the Boston
Design Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you asked me six years ago if I would ever work with fur,
I'd say, `Oh, no. Fur is awful,' '' she said. ``But recycling old
furs made so much sense to me, especially for the home, because it
uses a product that's already out there in abundance, and you don't
have to worry about being PC in your own house.''
</P>
<P>
   While the antifur movement remains vocal and strong in this
country, fur nonetheless is making a huge comeback in fashion for
fall 2000, and home fashion has followed suit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't keep enough fur in the store,'' said Eduardo
Lizarraga, who owns the Furn &AMP; Co. showroom at the Boston Design
Center. ``It's the great economy, plus the desire to have all the
extravagant items you want. Fur fits into that. It's how it looks
and how it feels. It's all about glamorama.''
</P>
<P>
   Lizarraga, who carries Hayes's pillows, says decorators steadily
come in with clients looking for the ultimate home accent and leave
with lavishes like a $4,500 lynx rug.
</P>
<P>
   Pillows, throws, rugs, and even queen-size bedspreads are being
done in mink, lynx, and chinchilla, some faux, some real, and they
are flying out of his shop. He said the resurgence of fur for the
home is also linked to the nostalgia trend in fashion, where styles
from the '30s, '40s, and '50s are back in vogue, evoking the days
when high-living meant gathering around the bearskin rug with a
shaker of martinis. He said it's been chic to cover furniture with
fur, going back to Louis XVI and beyond: ``There's something very
primal about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Lizarraga warns not to overdo it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The statement is to make it look classic, not tacky,'' he
said. ``So, you pick a few key pieces to accent a room, not
overwhelm it. You don't want a mink sofa.''
</P>
<P>
   Amy Dumas Malle, lead designer and sales manager at Roche-Bobois
in Cambridge, which specializes in European furniture, said fur has
been a tried-and-true accessory in homes in Italy and England,
giving rooms an air of regal sophistication.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has been in use in European interiors since dirt,'' she
said with a laugh. ``But it has always brought the Old World
classical feeling even into an contemporary interior.''
</P>
<P>
   Anna Galloway, manager of Black Ink (at) Home in Cambridge,
which carries several of Hayes's footstool designs, said her
customers are turning their backs on the ``cold, minimalism'' look
that has been popular for the past few years, in favor of
``exquisite little touches for their home that make them feel
pampered.''
</P>
<P>
   ``People want things that feel really good, and we've done very
well with the footstools,'' she said. ``But you have to have a very
tidy house, with not a lot of muddy boots around.''
</P>
<P>
   Tracey Horgan of Derry, N.H., owns one of Hayes's Persian lamb
pillows with opalescent bead trim, a present from her fiancee, Todd
Bissell, who perched her engagement ring atop it when he proposed
last spring.
</P>
<P>
   She saw the pillow in Hayes's home studio after being introduced
by mutual friends, told Bissell about it, and he surprised her
doubly the day he asked for her hand. The couple will have a ring
bearer carry the pillow at their April wedding.
</P>
<P>
   Horgan, 36, said she is enchanted by the pillows for their look,
but especially loves that they have had former lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like that idea that they come from coats from the '30s,
'40s, and '50s,'' she said. ``It's almost like you have a piece of
time. God only knows where it's been and where it's traveled and
who's had it. It's so unique and something beyond beautiful.''

FALL'S THE TIME TO TACKLE HOME PROJECTS

   They are so true, the things your mother told you when you were
a tad. Ma was a smart cookie. If you did all the things she told
you, you'd be king of the mountain.
</P>
<P>
   Strangely, mother never told us about houses. Well, maybe about
how wonderful a house, or even an apartment, would be for us. I
think she was trying to get us out of her house.
</P>
<P>
   She never said how tender those houses and apartments can be,
though. They can be very susceptible to weather and wear and tear.
They need tender loving care, the same TLC that Ma gave us. It's
called maintenance.
</P>
<P>
   Some chores are best done in the fall, when you may not be as
busy as in other seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Outdoor paint and stain jobs need touching up. If you see a bit
of paint peeling, scrape it clear, sand it, and dab on a bit of
primer and house paint. If your house is stained, do the same with
stain, except you may not need the primer. The patching will add
years to the paint job, and the patches will not show for very
long; weather will make them blend in.
</P>
<P>
   Take a tour of the house, concentrating on wood decks and
brickwork. These tours are not just to get the house ready for
winter, but to keep it fom rotting away or falling apart.
</P>
<P>
   Check the deck for broken boards or decay. Popular deck floors
are fir, cedar, mahogany, and pressure-treated wood. The latter is
not supposed to decay, but it can happen. Other woods, while
resistant to decay, are not foolproof.
</P>
<P>
   Where you find a rotted board or one broken beyond repair, take
it out and put in a new one.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes you can dig out the rotten area, apply bleach to kill
the mold that caused the decay, and fill the cavity with an epoxy
rot filler. Minwax makes a popular one, and such fillers last many
years. One problem is they cannot be stained or sealed.
</P>
<P>
   If the board is rotten at only one end, cut out just the rotten
end, making sure you make the cut with a rotary saw directly over a
joist, so when you install a new board you will have a joist to
nail into.
</P>
<P>
   Just pry up the board with a pinch bar, a 2-foot-long
crowbar-type tool with a hook on one end and a blade on the other.
This is easier said than done, because you could damage other
boards with this method.
</P>
<P>
   Try unscrewing the deck screws, if they are, indeed, screws.
Nails are tougher; you may need a cat's-paw, a special hooked tool
that you can hammer over the nail head and pry.
</P>
<P>
   If you can give the board a whack from below, push it up that
way, then tap it back; with luck, the nails will pop and you can
pry them out.
</P>
<P>
   Some deck boards are installed with clips, so there are no nail
or screw heads showing. You may have to split or saw the board down
its middle to take sections out, one at a time. Also, because it is
a single board with others installed on each side, it may need
face-nailing (with the heads showing) instead of reusing the clips
or using new clips.
</P>
<P>
   Stain the new board to match the rest of the deck, or seal it
with a water seal, and eventually it will weather to match its
neighbors.

   Sydney Olympics coverage continues all day on NBC, CNBC and
MSNBC, beginning with beach volleyball at 10 a.m. on the broadcast
network. Bob Costas hosts NBC's 7 to midnight prime-time block,
which focuses on marquee events in track and field, diving and

basketball and weight lifting.
</P>
<P>
   As always, the coverage is tape-delayed from much earlier in the

viewers. NBC will work hard to shape the competition into stories
about heroes; if all you want is results, those are available all
day via other news sources.
</P>
<P>
   Jay Leno will host a mini-``Tonight Show'' on NBC that lasts six
minutes at 12:35 a.m., featuring a monologue and perhaps one or two
taped comedy bits. Late-night events that follow on NBC include
more track and field events and volleyball.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; HIGHLIGHTS &LR;  &QL;

FAMILY MEALTIME CAN NOURISH YOUR CHILDREN'S MINDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BARBARA F. MELTZ  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When she was growing up, Laurel Dickson-Bull's parents made sure
the family ate dinner together every night. Ditto for her husband,
John Bull. Now parents themselves, they'd like to duplicate the
tradition for their own children, but they don't seem able to pull
it off.
</P>
<P>
   First, they both work. Bull sometimes doesn't get home to
Boxborough, Mass. until after 7:30, too late for their kids to wait
to eat. On top of that, Andrew, 11, Juliet, 9, and John, 7, have a
kazillion activities of their own that often interfere with dinner.
</P>
<P>
   ``We shoot for eating together three nights a week,'' says
Dickson-Bull. ``Most weeks, we make it.''
</P>
<P>
   In our jam-packed, over-scheduled lives, the nightly family meal
is fast becoming an anachronism, a ritual we think of with
fondness, but one we associate with previous generations. That's a
mistake, say psychologists and others who research families. As we
settle into new routines with a new school year, they urge parents
to make family mealtime a priority.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think of eating together as home base, a kind of glue that
keeps a family connected. When it disappears, the family is in
jeopardy,'' says psychiatrist James Comer of the Yale Child Studies
Center.
</P>
<P>
   A daily family meal is so important to family educator Jean
Illsley Clarke of Minneapolis that if she could make her adult
children young again, she'd be inflexible about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we couldn't have dinner together each day, I'd insist on
breakfast, and I don't mean a piece of toast standing at the
counter,'' she says. ``If that couldn't happen, I would arrange for
a time each day where we all sat down with a cup of cocoa.''
</P>
<P>
   Clarke likes to serve food that brings pleasure, but it's the
act of eating together that counts, not the food. That's because
humans learn from birth to associate bodily nourishment with
emotional closeness. ``Whether they are being nursed or taking a
bottle, an infant's first relationship occurs during feeding,'' she
says. ``It's an association parents would be wise to capitalize
on.''
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, we often don't, especially when we have babies
and toddlers. Dinnertime can be so chaotic and inconvenient, not to
mention messy, that many parents choose to eat separately.
</P>
<P>
   Developmental psychologist Phyllis Sonnenschein is sympathetic
but firm. ``That may be good for the marriage,'' she says, ``but
not for the family. I recommend it no more than once a week.'' She
says it's important to tell even very young children that eating
together is a way for parents and children to enjoy each other's
company. ``Tell them, `We aren't just nourishing our bodies but
also our souls,' '' she says.
</P>
<P>
   In the process, it sends a clear message: This is important.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Mood at table is crucial
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It's not enough to plop food down haphazardly, however. ``The
tenor of the table counts,'' says Clarke, author of ``Connections:
The Threads that Strengthen Families'' (Hazelden Press).
</P>
<P>
   The way the table is laid as well as the mood around it can make
the difference between a meal being a positive experience or a
nightmare. Some good rules of thumb:
</P>
<P>
   Avoid charged topics. ``If a child's done something wrong, this
is not the time to air it,'' says Comer.
</P>
<P>
   Monitor manners sparingly. ``I met a family who gave timeouts
for giggling at the table. That's overkill,'' says pediatric and
family psychologist Peter Goldenthal of Wayne, Pa.
</P>
<P>
   ``I back off when I can,'' he says. ``For me, it's more
important that kids be at the table enjoying our company than
having perfect manners at a given moment.'' Goldenthal is author of
``Beyond Sibling Rivalry'' (Owl Books).
</P>
<P>
   Keep conversation engaging. Conversation doesn't always have to
be about or directed to children, but the more they can join in,
the better. One Harvard University study links children's literacy
and school success to explanatory talk at the dinner table _ for
instance, discussions of presidential politics or the day's news.
Not only does that expand a child's world but it also helps a child
learn to handle differences of opinion, negotiate ways to get into
a conversation, hear new vocabulary words, and predict and
anticipate parents' reactions.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
A sense of security
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Assuming parents are pleasant and not sniping at each other, the
habitualness of the family meal can be ``a kind of security,'' says
Comer.
</P>
<P>
   That's true even for teenagers, says psychologist Blake Bowden,
a researcher at Children's Hospital Medical Center of Cincinnati.
In 1997, he conducted a study to see what protects teenagers
against maladjustive behaviors. The answer: sitting down to a meal
with a parent at least five times a week. That was such a surprise,
it made headlines all over the country.
</P>
<P>
   Bowden found the results personally validating. He grew up in a
single-parent home and had friends who were always angling for an
invitation to dinner. Now he knows what it was all about.
</P>
<P>
   ``My friends knew my mother was always home for that meal,'' he
says. ``Their parents weren't. It was her input they wanted.''
</P>
<P>
   Bowden has another theory about his findings: ``It may not be
only the mealtime that's working in a teen's favor. If parents are
organized enough to make a routine out of dinner, despite how busy
we all are, maybe this is symbolic of the way this family
functions.''
</P>
<P>
   Eating also makes family members kinder, says Comer. It ``puts
people in a better mood.''

TIPS FOR PARENTS
</P>
<P>
   --Consider it a red flag if a teen rarely makes it home for
dinner. Are there dynamics at the meal that turn him off? Are there
other times/ways you communicate regularly with him? &QL; 
 &QL; 
--When children eat before working parents get home, save a course
for them to eat along with you, dessert or salad, so you're still
sitting down together and talking. &QL; 
 &QL; 
--Every meal doesn't have to be a banquet or home-cooked. Takeout
food works as long as you're eating it together. &QL; 
 &QL; 
--Even young children benefit from having a responsibility at
dinnertime, such as carrying condiments to the table. &QL; 
 &QL; 
--It's never too late to initiate a daily family mealtime. &QL; 
 &QL; 
--Food for thought about family mealtimes: ``The Joy of Family
Rituals'' by Barbara Biziou (St. artin's); ``Family Theme Dinners

&HT;     GEORGE STRAIT CONTINUES TO RIDE HIGH IN THE SADDLE

<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ Radio personality Jerry King will never forget the
day George Strait walked into the KKYX-AM studio with a 45-rpm
record titled ``Unwound.''
</P>
<P>
   After a brief on-the-air interview, King played the honky-tonk
cheating song and Strait abruptly left.
</P>
<P>
   ``He ran outside and got in his truck,'' King recalled. ``I
thought it had made him mad. Erv Woolsey says, `No, he's driving up
and down the driveway because he's never heard himself on the
radio.'''
</P>
<P>
   Erv Woolsey was the MCA-Nashville promotions executive who
became Strait's manager.
</P>
<P>
   That was 1981, and King was the first deejay to spin a Strait
record on the air. ``Unwound'' went to No. 6, and Strait heard it
and others a few more times _ his songs have been in the charts for
almost 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   Yet another hit is on the air from Strait's 28th album, which is
now on sale.
</P>
<P>
   ``This one is titled `George Strait,''' King said. ``What more
of a title do you need?''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed.
</P>
<P>
   Strait just goes on riding high in the saddle.
</P>
<P>
   Once again, his Country Music Association nominations include
entertainer and male vocalist of the year. Plus, he is the
most-played country artist on the radio so far this year, according
to industry newspaper Radio and Records, and it's no wonder: Of his
62 singles, only three haven't broken the top 10 in Billboard's
charts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Go On,'' the first single from the new album, made that mark
last week. Typical of Strait's style on many of his mid-tempo
songs, the melody and instrumentation walk a fine line between
country and pop and the lyrics give a clever but mature view about
life going on in the wake of a broken heart.
</P>
<P>
   As always, though, Strait's interpretation makes the music. Song
after song, listeners slip into his easygoing, masterful vocals
that fit each tune as comfortably as a favorite pair of boots.
</P>
<P>
   ``George knows a good song when he hears it,'' said
MCA-Nashville president Tony Brown, who has co-produced a number of
albums with Strait, including the latest one.
</P>
<P>
   ``He always seems to find hit songs, songs with depth, and
everything in between. I really do consider him a master at that,''
Brown said.
</P>
<P>
   For every album, Strait goes through boxes of taped demo songs
from Brown and others, including writers he has previously
recorded, such as Dean Dillon, who co-wrote ``Unwound'' and the new
album's ``If It's Gonna Rain'' and ``She Took the Wind From His
Sails,'' said Kay West, Strait's Nashville-based publicist.
</P>
<P>
   ``George will ride around his ranch in his truck and listen for
what he likes,'' West said.
</P>
<P>
   Strait lives at the foot of the Hill Country just north of San
Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   After selecting a number of songs, he confers with Brown, who
cannot precisely define a Strait song.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I know when I hear it,'' he said. ``Really, that comes
down to a strong melody and a lyric that holds up to stuff he's
done in the past.
</P>
<P>
   ``We both end up agreeing on the final selections, but he knows
he has the `majority' vote.''
</P>
<P>
   The 10 songs on ``George Strait'' focus on tender love, tearful
love and cheating, and range from ballads and Cajun-tinged rockers
to a twin-fiddle-fueled, flat-out honky-tonker.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's another very traditional country album from George with
quality songs on cut after cut,'' said King of KKYX, a classic
country station in San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   Two songs that especially caught King's ear were ``Looking Out
My Window Through the Pain,'' which Mel Street recorded in the mid
1970s, and ``You're Stronger Than Me,'' done by Ray Price and the
Cherokee Cowboys in the early '60s.
</P>
<P>
   ``No modern country artist can update a song like George
Strait,'' King said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think George just likes those good-old, 4/4 shuffles. You've
got to remember he came from playing a lot of honky-tonks back in
the early days,'' said King, who first met Strait _ a native of
Pearsall, Texas _ in the late 1970s at the Jourdanton Days
festival, where he was playing with the Ace in the Hole Band.
</P>
<P>
   The album does not intentionally lean toward more traditional
country music in the wake of ``Murder on Music Row,'' the
tongue-in-cheek song on the March release of ``Latest Greatest
Straitest Hits'' which takes the Nashville music industry to task
for its pop flavor, Brown said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We cut that song because we thought it was cool,'' Brown said.
``We were not standing on a soap box.''
</P>
<P>
   The duet with Alan Jackson is up for a CMA award for vocal event
of the year and song of the year for songwriters Larry Cordle and
Larry Shell.
</P>
<P>
   Strait did push for including ``Looking Out My Window Through
The Pain,'' which sent Brown to the archives at Nashville's Country
Music Hall of Fame because Street's recordings are hard to find.
</P>
<P>
   As co-producer, Strait brings a great sense of musical
arrangement to the recording sessions, Brown said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The players react to him really well,'' Brown said. ``All I
can say is that he's a total pleasure to work with. Our sessions
are like small `live' shows.''
</P>
<P>

</P>

   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Strait also is known for his hands-on and professional approach
to his music, publicist West said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The joke around Music Row is that George will book his
musicians for a week and they know they'll get Friday off because
he takes just four days to record an album,'' West said.
</P>
<P>
   King is looking forward to spinning cuts from ``George Strait,''
especially the covers of the two classics.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think South Texans can get enough of George Strait,''
said King, whose station plays at least one Strait song every hour.
</P>
<P>
   King downplays his role in giving Strait his start on the radio.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just luck _ right place, right time,'' King said,
adding that Strait's success is no accident.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have superstars that come into this business and they go
like a house afire for a couple or three or four years or maybe
longer if they're lucky,'' King said. ``But do they really have
that legend status?
</P>
<P>
   ``When you think of legends, you think of George Jones, Hank
Williams Sr. _ and George Strait.''
</P>
<P>
   When King thinks of Strait, it's easy for him to relive that
special moment they shared when he first aired ``Unwound.''
</P>
<P>
   King only has to glance at his wall. That original 45 is there,
enshrined in glass.

<P>
   Maybe he was confused. Maybe the heckler who disrupted Oprah's
interview with George W. Bush on Tuesday morning got his
Chicago-based daytime talk show venues mixed up and thought he was
at the ``Jerry Springer Show'' downtown, when in reality he was in
the Harpo Studios on the near West Side of the city _ because you
do not heckle Oprah!
</P>
<P>
   Oprah gives you the heave-ho if you talk out of turn on her
watch.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry throws you out if you don't talk out of turn on his watch.
</P>
<P>
   Jokes aside, there's always a breath-grabbing moment when
somebody causes a disturbance at any event featuring a presidential
candidate. You never know if the guy shouting or the woman waving
the sign is just a rude goof _ or a zealot with a concealed weapon.
</P>
<P>
   Rest assured that when Oprah Winfrey's interview with George W.
Bush was briefly interrupted by a heckler, Secret Service agents
were instantly whispering into wrist-microphones, moving toward the
subject and/or reaching into their jackets in case force was going
to be necessary.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't necessary, because Oprah was in charge.
</P>
<P>
   Bush had just finished telling a joke when someone off-camera
hollered a question _ something about ``Democratic policies and
sanctions that killed 5,000 children.'' A startled Oprah whirled in
her chair, the cameras staying with her. She told the heckler he
couldn't ask that question _ but a moment later, when the same guy
said, ``I'm sorry to interrupt but I have to ask this question,''
Oprah cut him off and said they'd be going to commercial and
removing the guy from the audience.
</P>
<P>
   Other than that unscripted moment, there were few surprises but
plenty of laughs during the show, as Bush demonstrated he's as
quick on his feet as Gore and just naturally more relaxed.
</P>
<P>
   In the few minutes of her live interview with the Republican
presidential nominee, Winfrey made an announcement to the adoring
studio audience.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dub-ya, Dub-ya, Dub-ya's in the house!'' she crowed.
</P>
<P>
   Something tells me the likes of Tim Russert won't use the same
verbiage when Bush debates Gore, but I wish he would.
</P>
<P>
   Republican fears that the left-leaning Oprah would be tougher on
Bush than she was in her mushball session with Gore last week were
unfounded, as she allowed Bush to show what amounted to a personal
campaign video during the ``Remembering Your Spirit'' segment, and
asked him broad questions that allowed the candidate to give
generic, well-planned answers.
</P>
<P>
   But that's OK. Winfrey's not Ted Koppel, nor has she ever
pretended to be. She shouldn't be expected to press Gore or Bush on
policies any more than she would grill Tom Cruise about Scientology
when he's on promoting his latest movie.
</P>
<P>
   So when Bush said, ``My vision says every child is going to be
educated in America,'' and, ``I see America as a land of dreams and
hopes and opportunity,'' we shouldn't have been surprised that
Oprah didn't say something like, ``Nice bumper sticker, now how
about some specifics?''
</P>
<P>
   Even when Oprah did try to push the point, Bush was more than
ready.
</P>
<P>
   WINFREY: ``Tell us about a time when you needed forgiveness.''
</P>
<P>
   BUSH: ``Right now.''
</P>
<P>
   OPRAH: ``I'm looking for specifics.''
</P>
<P>
   BUSH: ``I know you are, but I'm running for president.''
</P>
<P>
   Nicely played! That line scored a big response from the studio
audience, second only to the roar that erupted when Oprah asked
Bush about his favorite dream and he assumed the stance of a
president-elect being sworn in.
</P>
<P>
   Bush also garnered a big laugh when an e-mailer asked what was
the biggest misconception people have about him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Probably (that) I'm running on my daddy's name,'' he replied.
``That if my name were George Jones _ well, I'd be a country and
western singer.''
</P>
<P>
   Give this guy an HBO special and see what he can do with it.
</P>
<P>
   As for the ``These Are a Few of My Favorite Things'' game, Bush
matched Gore's ``Wheaties'' faux pas of last week when he was asked
about his all-time favorite song.
</P>
<P>
   '''Wake Up Little Susie' by Buddy Holly,'' he replied.
</P>
<P>
   Um, that would be the Everly Brothers _ as Bush quickly
realized, correcting himself.
</P>
<P>
   Other spoon-fed questions revealed Bush's silver spoon
tendencies. Favorite gift given? He recounted how he ``gave'' his
wife the promenade to the SMU Library _ in other words, he paid for
the thing and had it named after her.
</P>
<P>
   Hardly something the average working stiff can relate to, is it?
</P>
<P>
   Adding to the preppy picture, W. cited his trip East to begin
private school as a moment of self-doubt. Not exactly the
equivalent of working two jobs so you can go to college.
</P>
<P>
   He also revealed that his prized possession is his ranch. One
could imagine the Bush team cringing, wondering why their boy
didn't come up with some touching anecdote about a medal won by his
father or perhaps a drawing done by one of his children on the
first day of school many years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he reminded us that, like his opponent, he was born to
the manor. They're the political equivalents of freshman
``legacies'' who are waived into snooty fraternities because their
daddies and granddaddies were stellar members.
</P>
<P>
   That doesn't make Bush and Gore bad guys. They're just not
regular folks.

OLD ECONOMY OR NEW, GLUTS CAN DOOM A FIRM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVEN SYRE AND CHARLES STEIN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Been to the movies lately? Apparently, not enough of us have.
</P>
<P>
   General Cinema, a Massachusetts company that owns movie
theaters, this week said it was contemplating a bankruptcy filing.
If General Cinema goes that route it will have plenty of company.
United Artists Theater Co., Edwards Cinemas, and Carmike Cinemas
have all filed for bankruptcy this year alone.
</P>
<P>
   How come? Too many seats and not enough bodies to fill them. The
nation's theater owners have boosted the number of screens by 34
percent in the last five years; demand has not grown as quickly.
</P>
<P>
   You've seen this movie before. It has played out in hotels,
restaurants and lots of other old-economy industries. Everyone sees
an opportunity and rushes to fill it at the same time. The result:
Supply exceeds demand, and everyone takes it in the neck.
</P>
<P>
   The question for today is: Can this same thing happen in the new
economy? We don't claim to know the answer, but there are enough
hints of gluts developing to make the question an interesting one.
Consider a few examples.
</P>
<P>
   --Telecom. America's telephone carriers _ established ones and
upstarts _ are furiously investing in new technology in a bid to
win the race to the future. The problem is, there isn't enough
business right now to go around.
</P>
<P>
   Sprint Corp. Wednesday said it would fall short of Wall Street's
expectations for the third quarter, in part because of fierce
competition for customers. The day before, a new carrier, ICG
Communications, said it might file for bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
   ``For all these guys to be successful, we will have to have
telephones growing out of every part of our body,'' said Thomas
O'Neill, manager partner of Navigator Asset Management, a hedge
fund.
</P>
<P>
   --Semiconductors. Historically, the chip business has swung
between gluts and shortages because when new capacity comes online,
it comes in big chunks. The industry is booming at the moment, but
Wall Street is already worried about the potential for the next
glut to develop. One sign of concern: Teradyne, a Boston maker of
semiconductor test equipment, has lost more than 50 percent of its
market value since the spring.
</P>
<P>
   --Internet consulting. A whole raft of companies has jumped into
this business, and who can blame them? Corporate America needs to
be Web-ready, and they need consultants to show them how. But
lately there have been suggestions that companies are taking a
pause before committing more money to such projects. Fears that the
slowdown could spread have slashed the value of the region's
e-consultants, including Breakaway Solutions and Viant.
</P>
<P>
   William Sahlman, professor of entrepreneurship at Harvard
Business School, finds nothing surprising in the emerging high-tech
gluts. ``Every industry overbuilds,'' he said. ``That's been true
since the beginning of time.''
</P>
<P>
   He argues that the new-economy gluts may be worse than usual,
because venture capitalists and Wall Street have funded so many
competitors in the same industries at the same time. Even
fast-growing markets can't support an unlimited number of entrants,
Sahlman said. ``The next great battlefield littered with corpses is
going to be optical switching,'' he predicted, referring to another
hot but crowded field.
</P>
<P>
   Others take a slightly more optimistic view of the same war
zone. Rob Joseph, an analyst with State Street Research, points out
that in many new-economy segments, one company develops superior
technology and uses that edge to build an insurmountable lead over
the competition.
</P>
<P>
   Weaker rivals may fail or be bought up, said Joseph, but that
will not stop the leaders _ the Sun Microsystems or EMCs _ from
continuing to prosper.
</P>
<P>
   Marc Klee is also in the optimists' camp. The manager of John
Hancock's Technology Fund said that when it comes to bandwidth,
gluts cannot develop ``because demand is insatiable.'' As fast as
capacity is added, he contends, it will be used up to handle the
transmission of data and video.
</P>
<P>
   Klee is also upbeat about the prospects for the semiconductor
business because he anticipates continued strong demand, especially
from the telecom business.
</P>
<P>
   The optimists have a point. The new economy has plenty of
potential, and many new-economy companies will turn in eye-popping
numbers for some time to come.
</P>
<P>
   But put us down in the camp that says the technology firms have
more in common with their friends in the movie theater business
than they would care to acknowledge.
</P>
<P>
   As Thomas O'Neill put it, ``The laws of capitalism and
competition apply to any economy, new, old, or in between.''
</P>
<P>
   For investors, that may mean sitting through some tear-jerkers
in the months ahead.

</P>
<P>
   Question: You said at one point that this was maybe the biggest
security breach of our lifetime.
</P>
<P>
   Answer: Yeah, yeah.
</P>
<P>
   That was host Bob Schieffer and Senate Majority Leader Trent
Lott on CBS's ``Face the Nation'' last Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   By now Republican criticism of the Clinton administration, and
Attorney General Janet Reno in particular, is beyond political
calculation and beyond cynicism. They do it by rote, like a ritual
incantation of the faith.
</P>
<P>
   You would think that even a politician's vestigial sense of
irony would give a U.S. senator pause before piling on about the
injustice done to Los Alamos nuclear scientist Wen Ho Lee, who was
kept in solitary confinement for nine months on lurid charges of
spying and then released after pleading guilty to something like
pocketing paper clips.
</P>
<P>
   There is, after all, plenty of other material available if you
wake up one morning and say to yourself, ``Y'know, I feel like
denouncing the Justice Department today.''
</P>
<P>
   And if you've run out, someone at Louis Freeh's FBI will be
happy to leak you some more.
</P>
<P>
   Of all the reasons one might attack the administration, many of
them justified, why choose one that puts you at the mercy of any
hack columnist with access to Nexis (the news media database)? To
do so suggests an unhealthy compulsion, if not severe short-term
memory loss.
</P>
<P>
   It was only last June, after all, that Lott was promising to
make the Wen Ho Lee case an issue in the election campaign. Way
back then _ three months ago _ the case was said to illustrate the
administration's disregard for American national security, not the
railroading of a basically innocent man because of his race.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I want to know is what actions are we going to take to
stop this kind of misconduct,'' Lott huffed, referring to Lee's
alleged spying, not the administration's prosecution of him.
</P>
<P>
   Now Lott says the question of Lee's guilt is ``not clear,'' but
``there's a real dichotomy'' between the way Lee was treated and
the wrist-slap for former CIA Director John Deutch, who
``apparently did the same thing.''
</P>
<P>
   No one has ever suggested that Deutch was a superspy for a
foreign government, so ``the same thing'' apparently means that
Lott now no longer believes that Lee was a superspy either. ``What
is the difference?'' According to Lott, it's that Deutch is ``a
buddy of the White House,'' whereas Lee is Asian-American. (That's
actually two differences. But who's counting?)
</P>
<P>
   ``It's unsettling,'' Lott piously concluded, though not so
unsettling that he had ever bothered to mention it in his many
calls for Reno's resignation during the past year
</P>
<P>
   The day Wen Ho Lee was arrested, Senate Intelligence Committee
Chairman Richard Shelby said, ``I think they've been too late, or
at least very tardy, in doing this.'' For the next year _ while Wen
Ho Lee languished in solitary _ Chairman Shelby had other concerns.
He bounced from talk show to hearing to press conference denouncing
administration laxness in cracking down on Chinese spies. ``This
problem could be more serious, more widespread, and potentially
more dangerous than most Americans realize,'' he foretold.
</P>
<P>
   And now? A modest mea culpa, perhaps? A morsel of apology? Not
quite. ``All I can say is I thought from the beginning that that
was a botched investigation,'' Shelby said last week, like a man
who warned that the Titanic was burdened by too many lifeboats.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Arlen Specter is not a person who brakes for ironies on his
way to a microphone. ``You have the grandest case of grand larceny
in the history of the world on the espionage and the theft of vital
American secrets'' was his summary of the situation during a
``Media Availability'' (actual name of the event) last year.
Specter accused the administration of ``incredible bungling'' that
``put millions of Americans at risk.''
</P>
<P>
   Everyone thought at the time that the ``bungling'' charge
referred to the Clinton administration's failure to arrest Wen Ho
Lee, or at least wiretap him, earlier. This might have been a
convenient time for Specter to mention his real concern that the
only person arrested in this grandest of grand larcenies was an
innocent man being railroaded because of his race. If he happened
to think so.
</P>
<P>
   But Specter modestly suppressed his civil libertarian concerns
until the case against Lee collapsed. Maybe he was waiting for an
appropriate occasion. At a recent ceremony for the 213th
anniversary of the Constitution, no less, Specter said, ``It's hard
to understand how a man can be a major threat to national security
one day and walk free the next.''
</P>
<P>
   And lest you think it's the walking free part he objects to now,
he added that the Justice Department ``threw the book at Dr. Lee to
make up for their own failings.`` Specter promises hearings on this
outrage, needless to say.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago Sen. Phil Gramm thought Janet Reno ought to resign
because the belated nabbing of the arch-spy Wen Ho Lee added to
``the cumulative weight of all her failures.''
</P>
<P>
   Now Gramm's well-known passion for racial justice makes him even
more adamant. ``I don't understand an administration that stands up
and damns racial profiling and yet engages in it when it suits,''
he said last week. Reno ought to resign ``if she had any honor and
any shame,'' observed this expert on those qualities.
</P>
<P>
   In short, the porridge is too hot. No, wait, it's too cold.
Whatever. The important thing is, it's Clinton's fault. Oh yeah,
and Reno should resign.

&HT;     CAREER ADVICE FROM A SAGE: `SCREW AROUND VIGOROUSLY' 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By DAVE MURPHY  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Every worker over 40 ought to hear Tom Peters
speak at least once. Not because he'll inspire you _ although he
certainly might _ but because he is liable to scare the hell out of
you.
</P>
<P>
   Peters, who wrote ``In Search of Excellence'' and so many other
top books that he has become the best-selling business author of
all time, contends not only that 90 percent of white-collar jobs
will be eliminated or dramatically changed in the next 10 years,
but that those workers and companies whose production is only
average will get clobbered by automation and the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``I call it the death knell for ordinary,'' Peters said in a
paper he presented here last week. ``Stand out _ as individual or
company _ or get run over. At, literally, the speed of light.''
</P>
<P>
   But that's not the scary part.
</P>
<P>
   Peters also described all the denial that goes on among
established workers and companies. He told his audience about how
he was going to present the handout in a speech to one company's
workers, but his staff was contacted in advance by the company's
officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``Would Mr. Peters mind if we edited out of the handout the part
about the Web?'' the company officials asked. ``It will upset our
people.''
</P>
<P>
   Peters, 57, doesn't mind upsetting people, of course _ as long
as he makes them think. He's afraid too many of his over-40
brethren are in the same sort of denial as that company's
officials. Younger workers' jobs are also in danger, of course, but
they're more likely to be aware of that.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are in the opening nanoseconds of an extraordinary
white-collar revolution,'' he said. Peters pointed to how workers
are endangered by the Internet, the pressure for greater speed and
three other aspects of what he calls a ``five-sided pincer
movement'':
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Destructive'' entrepreneurs and global competition. Younger
companies often can compete more effectively because they're
starting a process from scratch and dealing with today's issues,
not trying to make incremental changes to an outdated system.
</P>
<P>
   ``Intuit and Schwab do not wish to make the Bank of America a
better place,'' Peters said. ``They wish to kill it.''
</P>
<P>
   _ ``White-collar robots.'' Just as automation replaced many
blue-collar jobs, computers with a set of decision guidelines can
replace most functions now handled by people in such departments as
human resources, information systems, finance and engineering,
Peters said.
</P>
<P>
   He said that just as labor unions tried to slow the layoffs of
blue-collar workers in the past, now company vice presidents are
standing in the way of change because they don't want to lose
middle managers and administrative assistants _ and certainly not
their own jobs.
</P>
<P>
   _ Global outsourcing. The Internet makes it easier for U.S.
companies to assign white-collar jobs to workers in places like
India and Mexico, where wages are much lower.
</P>
<P>
   ``Each of us in this room is an RDA _ rapidly depreciating
asset,'' Peters said. You need to consider yourself a brand name,
not just a cog in a wheel, and come up with a plan for renewing and
upgrading your skills through continuing education.
</P>
<P>
   That doesn't mean necessarily getting university degrees, which
Peters believes will be obsolete in 20 years. People will be more
likely to get certificates for the specific work they complete
rather than an overall degree.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a rabid believer in education,'' he says. ``I just don't
think education has a lot to do with the number of years you are
incarcerated in an institution and spoken down to.''
</P>
<P>
   We're in an era when many workers' careers will outlive their
companies, so those who coast will end up toast.
</P>
<P>
   So what does Peters recommend amid all this uncertainty? ``SAV _
screw around vigorously. For God's sakes, try something.''

</P>
<P>
   This week in Sydney, more than 400 top athletes are being pulled
aside and given a much-ballyhooed urine test for erythropoetin, or
EPO, a previously undetectable blood-enhancing compound favored by
cyclists, swimmers and other endurance athletes. As with most drug
tests, this one won't catch all the users _ just the stupid and
unlucky ones.
</P>
<P>
   The problem? The urine test detects whether EPO was used within
72 hours, while the drug is generally used six to eight weeks
before a big race. A handful of athletes will be expelled, and the
dirtiest Olympics in history will go on.
</P>
<P>
   More and more, the war on drugs in sports is starting to
resemble the one in society at large. Tiny victories are hailed
while the general, crushing defeat goes on. White House commissions
issue thunderous, instantly ignored reports. Rigid orthodoxies are
enforced, while an obvious question is declared taboo: Why not
legalize?
</P>
<P>
   Even IOC President Juan Antonio Samaranch has been tempted.
``The list of (banned) products must be reduced drastically,'' he
declared in a 1998 interview. ``Anything that doesn't affect the
health of the athlete, for me isn't doping.''
</P>
<P>
   He was quickly shouted down _ but his idea was welcomed in the
most dope-ridden sport of them all, professional cycling. At the
time, cycling was mired in drug scandals stemming from the 1998
Tour de France, which saw several teams caught red-handed and
kicked out of the race. It was an agonizing spectacle, and in its
aftermath drug use declined _ but only temporarily.
</P>
<P>
   This spring, the French sports daily L'Equipe mourned that
cycling had returned to ``the route'' of doping. And murmurs about
legalizing drugs continue within the sport.
</P>
<P>
   Why do cyclists use drugs? It seems like dirty play to
civilians, but performance-enhancement is part of the culture of
the sport, legal or otherwise. A top professional might race 80
days a year, including three straight weeks at the Tour de France,
a schedule so demanding that virtually no one could survive it
without vitamin supplements, amino acids and constant medical
attention. Caffeine is on the banned list, but a pre-race triple
espresso is considered almost mandatory (and is usually invisible
by the time the urine tests are done).
</P>
<P>
   On top of that, the current rules are really no more than a set
of interlocking loopholes that practically encourage a certain
level of doping. Many riders are actually permitted to use many of
the key items on the banned list, including corticoids (which
reduce stress and soreness) and anti-asthmatics (which aid
breathing), provided they have a doctor's prescription. Needless to
say, there are quite a few diagnosed asthmatics in the pro peloton.
</P>
<P>
   But the drug of choice for the last 10 years has been EPO, which
raises the percentage of oxygen-carrying red blood cells (the
``hematocrit''). A normal male has a hematocrit between 38 percent
and 46 percent, while the International Cycling Union has set an
arbitrary limit of 50 percent. Message: Use EPO, but only up to 49
percent. The UCI has admitted that the average rider's hematocrit
has risen 5 percentage points since 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the top riders challenging Lance Armstrong in this
year's Tour de France _ including Marco Pantani, Richard Virenque,
Alex Zulle and the young phenom Franck Vandenbroucke _ have served
suspensions for EPO. Before EPO, a genetic freak like Lance
Armstrong would have dominated every race he entered because of his
superior lungpower. Now he has a tough time eking out victories _
and even he is tainted by the clouds of suspicion that loom over
the entire sport.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong's situation shows the downside of partial
legalization, which is essentially what is in effect. But what if
cycling _ and other sports _ took up Samaranch's proposal and
changed the rules to permit anything that does not endanger a
rider's health? Dope-ridden chaos would ensue, naturally. But what
if the athletes had to tell us what they were taking?
</P>
<P>
   Under this interesting modification (proposed on the cult Web
site cyclegossip.com and elsewhere), non-harmful substances would
be permitted, with a catch: Each team doctor would be required to
keep a dossier for each athlete, listing the products used, the
dosages and the dates. The doping dossiers would be released along
with the race results, allowing the public _ and the sponsors _ to
judge the true victor for themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Drug use, now hidden and prevalent, would become open and
prevalent, with worrisome possible consequences: Following their
heroes' example, young athletes would queue up for the latest blood
boosters and synthetic hormones, whose makers would proudly sponsor
them. There would be cheaters, of course, and so the athletes would
be tested frequently; any discrepancy between the dossier and the
test results would result in severe punishment for the rider and
the team doctor.
</P>
<P>
   But would fans bother watching a contest of pharmaceuticals
rather than athletics? It seems unlikely. Without fans, there are
no sponsors; without sponsors, no sport, at least in a professional
sense.

HACKMAN, FREEMAN ENERGIZED BY `SUSPISION'
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Eds: Fact box below) 
Our rating: 3 stars 
By BOB STRAUSS 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sometimes, great acting is enough. ``Under Suspicion'' is one of
those cases.
</P>
<P>
   A duet _ with, um, flourishes _ between a clearly charged-up
Gene Hackman and Morgan Freeman, ``Suspicion'' gives both veterans
ample opportunity to dig deep into their reserves of craft. A
snaky, stone-unturning interrogation drama, it offers the two
``Unforgiven'' co- stars every opportunity not only to strut their
formidable technique and indulge the kind of byplay only longtime
masters can accomplish, but also to explore alarmingly intimate
corners of the aging male psyche.
</P>
<P>
   The film is bracing as long as these two are on together, which
is most of the time. But even their stellar work can't completely
disguise the scenario's setup-heavy contrivance. An overemphasized
red herring toward the climax is also distracting; it leeches
impact away from the psychological revelations that are the film's
real meat _ not to mention being a borderline infuriating narrative
cheat.
</P>
<P>
   The film is a plushly refurbished remake of the stripped-down,
French hothouse number ``Garde a Vue.'' The earlier version took
place entirely in a Paris police station on a rainy night. This one
is set in San Juan, Puerto Rico on the night of one those
elaborate, early-winter Caribbean carnival celebrations.
</P>
<P>
   Director Stephen Hopkins (``Lost in Space,'' ``Blown Away'')
also tricks matters up with numerous flashbacks, re-enactments and
even a number of surreal restagings of alarming events, in which
Freeman's police inspector Victor Benezet inserts himself into
events that his suspect, Hackman's wealthy tax attorney Henry
Hearst, may or may not be truthfully recounting.
</P>
<P>
   The resulting swirl of evidence, insinuation and obfuscation
becomes pretty baroque at times. But for the most part, the
emotional engagement of dogged, resentful detective and blustering,
secretly vulnerable power broker remains the main focus, and the
actors lead us through it with evident relish.
</P>
<P>
   While a lavish fund-raising event waits for its featured speaker
on the other side of a celebrant-clogged square, Benezet and his
hotheaded young assistant, Owens (Thomas Jane), try to browbeat
Hearst into confessing to a pair of schoolgirl rape murders. A day
earlier, Hearst discovered the latest corpse on his morning jog,
but there are discrepancies with the report he filed. Benezet and
Owens marshal every trick at their command to entrap the crafty old
lawyer, and indeed Hearst becomes deeper enmeshed in a skein of his
own lies the longer the night wears on.
</P>
<P>
   But to really get to his prey, Benezet has to access his own
emotional dysfunctions that intersect what he suspects of Hearst.
The film becomes more than a cat-and-mouse game along this line; it
turns into a sharing of grief between two old men whose love lives
have been devastatingly unfulfilling. As the real details of
Hearst's relationship with his beautiful young trophy wife (Italian
actress Monica Bellucci) accrue, a profound sadness informs the
game. While you can still view Benezet as kind of pitiful and
Hearst as some kind of monster by film's end, you can't help but
sympathize with each man's personal predicament.
</P>
<P>
   Hackman, who has long wanted to remake ``Garde a Vue,'' is as
engaged with the material as he's been with anything. Whether
bellowing or cracking, misleading or cornered, every nerve in his
body seems to be on constant alert _ and you can feel it in the
moments when Hearst is supposedly just listening, too. For an actor
who too often follows a paycheck instead of his best instincts
(anyone who saw the recent ``Replacements'' walk-through knows what
I mean), Hackman really offers his many fans a satisfying feast
here.
</P>
<P>
   Freeman, on the other hand, is rarely less than 100 percent
committed to his work. It's almost possible to take his consistent
excellence for granted, but he's just too vital a force for such
complacency to ever stick. On the heels of totally revitalizing the
sensitive hit man archetype in ``Nurse Betty,'' he brings fine
human shadings to the oft-visited, relentless detective here.
</P>
<P>
   Hackman and Freeman had some great scenes together in
``Unforgiven.'' ``Under Suspicion'' is hardly the masterwork that
film was, but the two stars give just as much to it.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps even more. &QL;

   One wonders what the rest of the casts of WB's teen-angst series
make of ``Grosse Pointe,'' a new comedy from ``Sex and the City's''
Darren Star. The show focuses on the spoiled, venal and numbingly
stupid cast members of a prime-time soap, also titled ``Grosse
Pointe,'' which is only nominally more brain-dead than, say,
``Dawson's Creek'' or NBC's upcoming prime-time soap ``Titans.''
</P>
<P>
   Given that Star created both ``Beverly Hills 90210'' and
``Melrose Place'' _ and will soon uncork ``The $treet,'' a soap set
in the world of high finance _ he clearly has plenty of material
from which to draw. Tonight's premiere of ``Grosse Pointe'' offers
a couple of obvious allusions to past Star turns, from the
egomaniacal harridan playing the sweet heroine when she's not
back-stabbing her colleagues (think Shannen Doherty before her
attitudinal rehab on the WB's ``Charmed'') and the follicly
impaired actor playing a teen (think Luke Perry).
</P>
<P>
   Star and company have a lot to set up in a mere 22 minutes in
tonight's episode _ the vaguely complicated show-within-a-show
concept means most of the actors have two characters they're
playing: the vain, usually pathetic star as well as the fictional,
dopey soap character. That the performers seem a little
interchangeable at first _ they're even wearing each other's
wardrobes _ may be due to all the traffic directing this first
episode demands, but it's also probably a cagey comment on the
nature of WB soapers in general.
</P>
<P>
   So here's a handy scorecard: Irene Molloy is the real-life
actress playing the vindictive harpy actress named Hunter Fallow,
who stars as the innocent, frequently victimized Becky on the
schlock-within-the-show. Bonnie Somerville essays the ``new girl''
named Courtney Scott, a serious Method actress bewildered by the
laissez-faire rules of network television, playing Becky's orphaned
cousin Laura (naturally, Hunter loathes the new competition for the
camera's and fans' affections). Lindsay Sloane plays the insecure
and likely bulimic Marcy Sternfeld; both are fairly timorous over
being voted least sexy cheerleader in an entertainment magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Al Santos plays studly doofus Johnny Bishop, who coasts on his
looks while playing Becky's brother Brad. Kohl Sudduth is balding
thespian Quentin King, who plays rebel Stone Anders. Kyle Howard
plays a stand-in who aspires to stardom and will ply his co-stars
with illicit chemicals until his big break.
</P>
<P>
   Tonight's ``Grosse Pointe'' premiere is fairly broad in its
humor, but is good for a few plangent smiles _ Hunter's rudeness
toward an ill child visiting the set recalls yet another bit of bad
behavior by another Hollywood brat. It's hardly as bracing or
hard-hitting as last year's briefly celebrated Hollywood satire,
``Action,'' and it remains to be seen if the rest of the country
really cares about how celebrities behave.
</P>
<P>
   But time spent with the show passes fairly breezily and, if
nothing else, this could serve fair warning to the actors on ``The
$treet'' _ you are being watched. Pull any ego-tripping stunts, and
you'll see it a few weeks later on ``Grosse Pointe.'' &QL;

</P>
<P>
   Back in December, the Republican primary candidates met in a
Manchester, N.H., TV studio for the first debate that included
George W. Bush. They talked for 90 minutes, mainly about the
Internet and high-technology issues.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Forbes criticized the Justice Department for its case
against Microsoft and chastised Bush for not endorsing a permanent
moratorium on taxing the Internet. Orrin Hatch endorsed the
Microsoft case and the tax moratorium. Gary Bauer and Alan Keyes
fretted about children gaining access to electronic pornography.
John McCain came out even more strongly than his rivals for a
permanent tax moratorium and advocated wiring schools and libraries
to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Flash forward to September. The two presidential nominees are
fighting about adding a prescription drug benefit to Medicare,
educational standards, Social Security reform, and tax cuts. But
there's virtually no argument about matters virtual.
</P>
<P>
   There's no discussion of the Internet tax moratorium, electronic
privacy, the Microsoft trial, Internet pornography, the AOL-Time
Warner merger, or the Napster case. Moreover, there has been
essentially no argument on any of these issues since the nominees
emerged six months ago.
</P>
<P>
   Gore brings up his plans to wire schools and his concerns about
electronic privacy from time to time. But his comments on these
topics seldom draw any response from his Republican opponent.
</P>
<P>
   If Bush mentions the Internet, it's inevitably in the context of
mocking his opponent for claiming to have invented it.
</P>
<P>
   Why are Internet issues absent from what has been called the
first presidential campaign of the new economy? One factor is the
flow of high-tech money to both parties. Republicans are willing to
offend trial lawyers and Hollywood. Democrats are prepared to take
a financial hit for antagonizing drug, oil and insurance companies.
</P>
<P>
   But these days, neither party wants to cross the computer
industry, which, according to the Center for Responsive Politics,
has already given more than $22 million in this election cycle,
split fairly evenly between the two parties. Silicon Valley cash
has created an artificial consensus on such issues as the Internet
tax moratorium, which both candidates favor despite the lack of any
rational justification.
</P>
<P>
   But a more significant factor may be where the 2000 election is
being fought. Crucial early primaries took place in Washington, New
Hampshire and California, where a significant proportion of the
voting population has a stake in tech issues. The Progressive
Policy Institute has compiled a state-by-state ``New Economy
Index,'' which gives a sense of how these states differ from
others.
</P>
<P>
   As of just over a year ago, New Hampshire ranked first in the
share of its workers in computer-related jobs, with 8.2 percent
employed in the tech sector. New Hampshire came in fifth in online
population, with 41 percent of its citizens having Internet access.
As for California, its overall ``New Economy'' ranking was No. 2,
putting it just behind Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   The higher-tech states are not completely out of play. Bush and
Gore have both been spending time in Washington and New Hampshire,
which are considered to be up for grabs (though New Hampshire, with
four electoral votes, is too small to worry much about). But the
candidates have mainly been campaigning and spending their TV ad
dollars in the so-called ``battleground'' states: Michigan, Ohio,
Pennsylvania, Missouri, and Florida. In these states, the ``old
economy'' still predominates.
</P>
<P>
   The industrial states of the Midwest have fewer software and
Internet startup companies, less venture capital money, and are
less dependent on foreign trade. Their workers are more likely to
belong to unions and less likely to change jobs frequently or trade
stocks online. The Progressive Policy Institute ranks their ``New
Economy'' status as follows: Pennsylvania 24, Florida 25, Ohio 33,
Michigan 34, Missouri 35.
</P>
<P>
   What's true of the swing states is even truer of swing voters in
the swing states. There is no exact consensus about who the crucial
``undecided'' voters are in this election. The Bush campaign
appears to be targeting younger single voters, who may be skeptical
about the long-term viability of Social Security. The Gore campaign
seems to be trying to win over those who are married and closer to
retirement. But various surveys show that the voters who still
haven't decided at this stage of the campaign are
disproportionately independents, disproportionately female, and
disproportionately in the $30,000-50,000 income range.
</P>
<P>
   These demographic categories all correlate to below-average
concern about and involvement with the Internet. According to a
recent survey conducted by Mark Penn for the Democratic Leadership
Council, independents are more likely than either Democrats or
Republicans to be pessimistic about the New Economy and what it
means for them. Women making $30,000 a year have bigger things to
worry about than the risk of having to pay sales tax when shopping
online.
</P>
<P>
   We've heard a lot this year about ``wired workers'' and ``new
economy'' voters. According to Business Week, they make up 33
percent of the electorate. As a group, they're economically
conservative and socially liberal. They're also under 50,
college-educated, and upwardly mobile. They own stocks, surf the
Web and don't smoke. They could have been this year's soccer moms.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately for them, neither candidate thinks they'll be
deciding the election.

HACKMAN, FREEMAN ENERGIZED BY `SUSPICION' 
RESENDING TO CORRECT TYPO IN HEADLINE
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Fact box below) 
Our rating: 3 stars 
By BOB STRAUSS 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sometimes, great acting is enough. ``Under Suspicion'' is one of
those cases.
</P>
<P>
   A duet _ with, um, flourishes _ between a clearly charged-up
Gene Hackman and Morgan Freeman, ``Suspicion'' gives both veterans
ample opportunity to dig deep into their reserves of craft. A
snaky, stone-unturning interrogation drama, it offers the two
``Unforgiven'' co- stars every opportunity not only to strut their
formidable technique and indulge the kind of byplay only longtime
masters can accomplish, but also to explore alarmingly intimate
corners of the aging male psyche.
</P>
<P>
   The film is bracing as long as these two are on together, which
is most of the time. But even their stellar work can't completely
disguise the scenario's setup-heavy contrivance. An overemphasized
red herring toward the climax is also distracting; it leeches
impact away from the psychological revelations that are the film's
real meat _ not to mention being a borderline infuriating narrative
cheat.
</P>
<P>
   The film is a plushly refurbished remake of the stripped-down,
French hothouse number ``Garde a Vue.'' The earlier version took
place entirely in a Paris police station on a rainy night. This one
is set in San Juan, Puerto Rico on the night of one those
elaborate, early-winter Caribbean carnival celebrations.
</P>
<P>
   Director Stephen Hopkins (``Lost in Space,'' ``Blown Away'')
also tricks matters up with numerous flashbacks, re-enactments and
even a number of surreal restagings of alarming events, in which
Freeman's police inspector Victor Benezet inserts himself into
events that his suspect, Hackman's wealthy tax attorney Henry
Hearst, may or may not be truthfully recounting.
</P>
<P>
   The resulting swirl of evidence, insinuation and obfuscation
becomes pretty baroque at times. But for the most part, the
emotional engagement of dogged, resentful detective and blustering,
secretly vulnerable power broker remains the main focus, and the
actors lead us through it with evident relish.
</P>
<P>
   While a lavish fund-raising event waits for its featured speaker
on the other side of a celebrant-clogged square, Benezet and his
hotheaded young assistant, Owens (Thomas Jane), try to browbeat
Hearst into confessing to a pair of schoolgirl rape murders. A day
earlier, Hearst discovered the latest corpse on his morning jog,
but there are discrepancies with the report he filed. Benezet and
Owens marshal every trick at their command to entrap the crafty old
lawyer, and indeed Hearst becomes deeper enmeshed in a skein of his
own lies the longer the night wears on.
</P>
<P>
   But to really get to his prey, Benezet has to access his own
emotional dysfunctions that intersect what he suspects of Hearst.
The film becomes more than a cat-and-mouse game along this line; it
turns into a sharing of grief between two old men whose love lives
have been devastatingly unfulfilling. As the real details of
Hearst's relationship with his beautiful young trophy wife (Italian
actress Monica Bellucci) accrue, a profound sadness informs the
game. While you can still view Benezet as kind of pitiful and
Hearst as some kind of monster by film's end, you can't help but
sympathize with each man's personal predicament.
</P>
<P>
   Hackman, who has long wanted to remake ``Garde a Vue,'' is as
engaged with the material as he's been with anything. Whether
bellowing or cracking, misleading or cornered, every nerve in his
body seems to be on constant alert _ and you can feel it in the
moments when Hearst is supposedly just listening, too. For an actor
who too often follows a paycheck instead of his best instincts
(anyone who saw the recent ``Replacements'' walk-through knows what
I mean), Hackman really offers his many fans a satisfying feast
here.
</P>
<P>
   Freeman, on the other hand, is rarely less than 100 percent
committed to his work. It's almost possible to take his consistent
excellence for granted, but he's just too vital a force for such
complacency to ever stick. On the heels of totally revitalizing the
sensitive hit man archetype in ``Nurse Betty,'' he brings fine
human shadings to the oft-visited, relentless detective here.
</P>
<P>
   Hackman and Freeman had some great scenes together in
``Unforgiven.'' ``Under Suspicion'' is hardly the masterwork that
film was, but the two stars give just as much to it.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps even more. &QL;

HIGH TREAT WITH `FIDELITY'
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Eds: Short fact box below) 
By ROB LOWMAN 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Cameron Crowe once said that he thinks rock critics are happiest
in their rooms listening to music. Having been one himself, Crowe,
whose rock movie ``Almost Famous'' is getting great reviews, should
know.
</P>
<P>
   The same can probably been said about record store clerks _
particularly those at those indie stores, who are in their hearts
rock critics who just haven't put their thoughts on paper. This
leads us to ``High Fidelity,'' which hit video stores this week.
Released in March, it's just about the last really good film to
come out this year until ``Famous.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Fidelity,'' based on the acclaimed 1995 novel by English
writer Nick Hornby, is about Rob (John Cusack), who runs a record
store, Championship Vinyl.
</P>
<P>
   ``Did I listen to pop music because I was miserable or was I
miserable because I listened to pop music?'' he asks the camera as
his girlfriend, Laura (Danish actress Iben Hjejle, though you
wouldn't know it) walks out the door of their apartment. ``There's
no place for you in the top five,'' he rails, referring to his
all-time list of heartbreakers. Music-philes like Rob are fond of
lists, you see.
</P>
<P>
   If Rob seems subnormal, he looks positively sane compared to his
two employees _ Barry (Jack Black) and Dick (Todd Louiso) _ who
take record-store geekiness to an artform, tormenting customers for
their lack of knowledge and throwing so many obscure pop references
into their conversations that you'd think they were from another
planet. Actually, Black and Louiso are scary in their portrayals.
If you didn't know better, you'd think Cusack (who had a hand in
writing and producing the film) and director Stephen Frears had
recruited the duo from a real record store.
</P>
<P>
   But ``High Fidelity'' is about how pop culture becomes a way of
avoiding real emotions, real experiences. Music is the perfect
media; feelings are summed up in a pop song. Bruce Springsteen even
shows up in Rob's daydream to offer him advice.
</P>
<P>
   Everything for Rob is filtered through music. He's better at
making tapes for his potential girlfriends _ as sort of form of
seduction (picking the right songs in the right order is all
important) _ than he is in dealing with the problems that
inevitably ensue. He prefers the fancy lingerie in the early days
of a relationship to the cotton undies that get washed out and hung
on a line once a man and woman move in together. Worse, on some
levels Rob knows how emotionally stunted he is and yet can't get
beyond his record collection, which he endlessly reorganizes.
</P>
<P>
   ``High fidelity'' is a smart, funny film _ every performance is
a gem (Tim Robbins is quite amusing as a new-age jerk) _ that is in
tune with love in the modern world. Plus, it's got a (heart)beat
and you can dance to it.
</P>
<P>
   For those who buy the DVD, there are some added treats. Both
Cusack and Frears have some interesting thing to say about the
production, the actors, and how they transferred the story from a
London setting to Chicago. Since the movie revolves around lists,
many of the nine deleted scenes included on the DVD are various
lists that were probably cut because they slowed the plot.
Nevertheless, they are funny as stand-alone bits.
</P>
<P>
   And it has a killer soundtrack. Unfortunately, Hollywood Records
only released about a quarter of it. A box set would be in order _
but now I'm sounding like a record-store clerk. &QL; 
--- &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``High Fidelity'' is $32.99 for the DVD, while the VHS version
is priced for rental at $106.99. &QL;

&HT;     RAIDERS QB DEFLECTS CRITICISM ABOUT PASSING GAME 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   ALAMEDA, Calif. _ Oakland Raiders quarterback Rich Gannon did
not like the question. Not one bit.
</P>
<P>
   It seemed harmless enough: Did he feel it was important for the
offense to be more diversified Sunday against the Cleveland Browns
and involve players who hadn't gotten much work the first three
games of the season?
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, you know what, without getting into a big debate about
it, you all can say what you want about getting people involved in
the offense,'' Gannon said Wednesday. ``We had the ball 44 plays
last week. When you have the ball for 44 plays, not many people are
going to get the ball. That's just the way it is. We usually have
it 65-70 plays in the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``So, I don't know where all that stems from. I really have no
idea.''
</P>
<P>
   Sure he did, saying the news media are ``making a bigger issue
out of it.''
</P>
<P>
   It's true the offense had the ball for an unusually short amount
of time during the loss to Denver last Sunday. And that certainly
limited how creative the quarterback could be in calling plays.
</P>
<P>
   So perhaps it shouldn't be surprising that Tim Brown, the team's
most potent offensive threat, had nine balls thrown in his
direction while tight end Rickey Dudley and wideout James Jett had
two each and fullback Jon Ritchie one.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know for a fact as a quarterback in this offense, I don't
drop back and look for one particular guy,'' Gannon said. ``That's
just not the way this system's built. That's not the way I play the
game. If you look at the film from a detail standpoint, that's not
the way we do things here.''
</P>
<P>
   If the Broncos game was the exception to the rule, then Gannon
would win his case without having to go to jury. But it isn't.
</P>
<P>
   In the season opener against San Diego, Gannon threw once in
Dudley's direction and four times each to Jett and Ritchie. The
quarterback, meanwhile, threw to Brown 14 times.
</P>
<P>
   In Indianapolis, Gannon tried to hook up with Jett and Ritchie
one time each and Dudley four times. Brown had seven balls to try
to catch.
</P>
<P>
   Brown leads the team this season with 16 receptions. He's
followed by receiver Andre Rison and running back Tyrone Wheatley,
who have seven each. Dudley has four catches, one more than his
backup, Jeremy Brigham. Ritchie has three grabs, and Jett has two.
</P>
<P>
   Ritchie isn't getting overworked as a running back, either. He
has yet to carry the ball. But he doesn't want any part of this
subject.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know what, I stay out of that,'' he said. ``That is not up
to me at all. These coaches have coached a lot longer than I have,
obviously. So they know what they're doing.''
</P>
<P>
   At this point last season, Dudley was a forgotten man, too. But
he was mellow about his predicament. His patience ultimately paid
off: In the second half the ball was thrown in his direction a lot
more often, and he made the most of the opportunity, playing up to
his enormous potential.
</P>
<P>
   Now he's being ignored again.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once again, I'll be very mellow about it,'' Dudley said. ``I
just think we're trying out some different things, and trying to
see what works. That's the type of guy I am. I'm going to be mellow
about it.''

   CAMPAIGN-ROUNDUP (Undated) _ Vice President Al Gore, using his

persuades President Clinton to consider tapping into the nation's

Gov. George W. Bush, a former oil company executive, says Gore's

<P>
   ``That's a hell of a good idea!'' was the reported response of
playwright Arthur Miller upon learning that the Goodman Theatre in
Chicago planned to use Brian Dennehy to play Willy Loman in its
revival of ``Death of a Salesman.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed it was _ a near perfect fit of actor and role. But Miller
should have been tossing confetti at the prospect of having Goodman
artistic director Robert Falls as the production's director.
Productions of American classics like ``Death of a Salesman'' will
come and go; we'll see memorable Willy Lomans and be moved all over
again by lines that Miller first wrote in 1948: ``A man is not a
piece of fruit,'' ``He's liked, but he's not well liked'' and the
immortal ``attention must be paid.''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, it's hard to imagine a more accomplished vision than
this Falls/Dennehy collaboration, which opened Wednesday at the
Ahmanson Theatre after major success in Chicago and New York. All
of the major performers are superb, individually and as an
ensemble, and the creative team brings out a look that this play
never had before. But it's the director's vision, as much as any
single performance, that makes this production so memorable. In
Falls' hands, ``Death of a Salesman'' seems to take place within
the addled mind of Willy Loman. Now more than ever, this is the
story of a decent but flawed everyman fighting familiar demons and
sinking into madness.
</P>
<P>
   The dreamlike ambience is evident from the production's first
image: discordant jazz notes from Richard Woodbury's score, as the
lights of Willy's Studebaker shine into the audience, blinding us
before we're ever allowed to see the Salesman's face. For all the
scripted dialogue about the Loman family being ``boxed in,'' the
Ahmanson's turntable allows the rooms of the Loman household
(designed by Mark Wendland) to glide in and out, creating open
space or confinement on an as-needed basis. If Willy requires room
for a confrontation, he'll get it. This is his vision. Michael
Philippi's soft and hazy lighting meshes with Miller's dramatic use
of memory. ``What's the secret? How did you do it?'' Willy asks,
both of characters in the present and of apparitions.
</P>
<P>
   And there's the type of detail that stands out because it's so
consistent and seamless. It's in the way that second son Happy (Ted
Koch) has to pry his way under the arm of his father whenever
prized son Biff (Ron Eldard) is getting a hug; or in watching Willy
stoop to pick up papers that have fallen off his boss's desk mere
hours after he has instructed Biff never to do something like that.
Watch the way Willy, his sons and wife Linda (Elizabeth Franz)
huddle and shift during an after-hours powwow around the kitchen
table. Even in a house full of tension, this family has its rhythms
and can settle into familiar patterns.
</P>
<P>
   Already giving an audience an uncomfortable evening, Falls makes
powerful use of violent outbursts. The audience is jolted into
stunned silence as Linda bangs her hand on the table to get her
sons to take notice, or when Biff _ hardly a hulking linebacker
type _ flings himself into his oxlike father. ``Death of a
Salesman'' is supposed to make an audience weep. Falls also gets
gasps.
</P>
<P>
   So much has already been written about most of these
performances _ Dennehy's in particular _ that critics are getting
redundant. Let's start with Franz, the angry but rock-solid yin to
Dennehy's yang. She has a fire that actresses playing Linda Loman
can't always find. Long-suffering though she may be, Franz's Linda
is not a woman who expects or invites pity. She's a lot more
resilient than she looks, and she's burning with the same anger
over life's injustices that fuel Willy and Biff. Clearly, it's a
dangerous family legacy.
</P>
<P>
   Eldard is, in many ways, the surprise. He's got a good look for
Biff, a golden boy gone just a tiny bit soft, slight but capable of
bursts of rage. He and Dennehy are never in danger of out-growling
each other. Koch's Happy, the lazy ladies man, has a gravelly voice
and a cockiness he doesn't deserve. So often, it's clear the family
doesn't take him seriously, hence the chip he's carrying.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, there's the Salesman. Brian Dennehy is a man who is
almost too big for the stage, and Willy Loman is not a role that
calls for a lot of restraint. The beauty in this performance is the
little discoveries, how he can say, ``I'm tired to the death,'' as
though he's realizing it for the first time. He's got hair-trigger
anger that can take Willy from lucidity to near madness and back in
quick outbursts.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, Dennehy also brings out Willy's tenderness. We see
why Linda loves him, why we root for him even though, as Biff
claims, ``He had the wrong dreams. All, all wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Dennehy's work is one significant part of an amazing evening.
Credit Falls, the man who has made sure that _ 50 years after its
creation _ ``Death of a Salesman'' is as alive as ever. &QL;

NEW CUT LEAVES HEADS SPINNING
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Eds: Fact box below) 
Our rating: 3 1/2 stars 
By GLENN WHIPP 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   You probably remember the projectile vomiting, the spinning
heads and the floating bed. What you might not recall are the great
characterizations, fantastic acting and the direction that succeeds
in creating a mounting atmosphere of intense dread.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Exorcist'' is back, and if you've never seen William
Friedkin's masterpiece of horror in a movie theater, it's well
worth seeking out. Billed as ``the version you've never seen,''
this ``Exorcist'' could more accurately be described as ``the
version writer/producer William Peter Blatty always wanted you to
see.''
</P>
<P>
   This new cut of the film includes several scenes that Friedkin
deleted at the last minute (much to Blatty's dismay) in order to
tighten the film's pace and get it to a two-hour running time.
</P>
<P>
   As is typically the case, the director knew best. The additional
footage, particularly the infamous ``spider-walking'' scene of
little Linda Blair moving crablike down a flight of stairs,
certainly has its freak-show appeal. A couple of small scenes
illuminate and even fascinate. (A mid-exorcism talk between the two
priests _ Max von Sydow and Jason Miller _ is chilling.)
</P>
<P>
   But generally, the additions are superfluous, and, in the case
of a goofy conversation that has been tacked on to the ending, they
diminish the film's power. (Thankfully, the filmmakers did not
choose to include an even longer version of this ending scene,
which exists.)
</P>
<P>
   Where this new ``Exorcist'' shows marked improvement is its
remastered sound, which makes Robert Knudson's Oscar-winning work
even more of a revelation. From the early, eerie bubbling of the
fish tank in Regan's room to those weird sounds in the attic to
Mercedes McCambridge's terrifyingly vulgar voice-over work (subbing
for Blair), this movie's sound ranks as a landmark achievement.
(McCambridge reportedly inhaled raw eggs, alcohol and cigarettes _
while strapped to a chair, no less _ to achieve the desired vocal
raspiness.)
</P>
<P>
   Watching ``The Exorcist'' 27 years after its release, it's easy
to see how much the movie's story is a product of its times (who
can understand kids these days?) as well as the filmmakers' thinly
veiled misogyny (blossoming female sexuality sure can be a
nightmare!).
</P>
<P>
   But the movie worked then, and it still does. Raise a cup of pea
soup and celebrate its re-release. &QL; 
---``THE EXORCIST'' &QL; 
(Rated R: strong language and disturbing images.) &QL; 
The stars: Ellen Burstyn, Max von Sydow, Lee J. Cobb, Jason Miller,
Linda Blair. Behind the scenes: Directed by William Friedkin.
Screenplay by William Peter Blatty, based on his novel. Released by
Warner Bros. Running time: Two hours, 13 minutes. Playing:
Citywide.

plays down the harm caused by a longtime policy of taking
Aboriginal children from their families. For months, Aboriginal
protesters have said they would use the Sept. 15-Oct. 1 Olympics
and the intense media attention the games generate to highlight the
plight of their people. The previously conciliatory mood evaporated
recently following revelations that the government believes
accounts of the estimated 100,000 Aboriginal children taken by
authorities between 1910 and the 1970s - known as the stolen
generation'' - were exaggerated. Column will focus on Cathy

   COXNET INSIDE NASCAR 0921: HELMET SUPPORT _ Two fatal crashes at
New Hampshire International Speedway and injuries to drivers at
other NASCAR Winston Cup tracks have created a large demand for a
head-and-neck support device known by the acronym HANS.

<P>
   The device, made of carbon fiber and kevlar, has a high-back
collar and straps that fit under a driver's shoulder belts. It also
has straps that attach to the back of the driver's helmet. In a
sudden impact, the straps limit the forward movement of the
driver's head.

<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ Believe what you will. What follows is
not an offer of cold and irrefutable scientific evidence, but of
emotional and heart-felt testimony.
</P>
<P>
   The thing is, Kevin Williams was there. He had the best and
worst possible vantage point for the whole ordeal.
</P>
<P>
   Williams was the one who spent nearly a month of last year in
the hospital, stricken by a mysterious bacterial infection. He was
the one attached to a respirator, tubes sticking out of his body.
He was the one who endured three operations. He was so busy
fighting for his life, he forgot to worry about his status as a New
York Jet.
</P>
<P>
   He emerged a shrunken, thankful man. Happy to be anywhere that
isn't six feet underground.
</P>
<P>
   And this is what Kevin Williams believes:
</P>
<P>
   ``All I can say about that is, God is real good,'' Williams
said. ``He stuck by side every day of my life. He brought me back a
mighty long way. He told me that He would never bring me this far
to leave me.''
</P>
<P>
   New York Jets players and coaches have formed a devout
hallelujah chorus. Football can be such a cruel and bottom-line
business, but the feelings among the Jets go deeper than what
Williams has done for them lately. Williams did plenty on Sunday,
returning a kickoff 97 yards for a touchdown that jump-started a
27-14 victory against the Buffalo Bills.
</P>
<P>
   As returns go, though, it was nothing compared to the one that
Williams made to football. Williams checked into Lenox Hill
Hospital last October with a confounding bacterial infection in his
throat. The infection spread to his lungs and chest, introducing
Williams to the world of respirators and breathing tubes.
</P>
<P>
   Now Williams is starting at safety for a 3-0 team. Returning
kicks. Making a difference that Jets head coach Al Groh can't begin
to quantify with statistics.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every year a team has to find its heart,'' Groh said. ``No
matter what its heart was the year before, it has to develop a
collective heart. He certainly is one of those players, with his
fight and determination, who has helped provide the heart of the
team.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams spent 27 days in the hospital. One life-threatening
complication after another left him unconscious for nearly two
weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Football really wasn't a concern,'' Williams said. ``It was
just about trying to get Kevin back. I almost lost me. If you don't
have you, you don't have anything. If I had me and I had my family,
that was all I needed.''
</P>
<P>
   The third operation was the charm. Doctors cut into his side,
pried open his ribs and cleaned out the bacteria from his chest.
Still, Williams was something less than a shadow of himself _ 34
pounds below his playing weight of 190 _ when he showed up in
November at the Jets' practice facility. In February, doctors gave
Williams the go-ahead to begin working out again.
</P>
<P>
   ``Going through what he went through last season, and him coming
back and starting and making big plays, it does my heart real
good,'' Jets cornerback Marcus Coleman said. ``He comes out every
day and works so hard. He tries to do everything right.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams even brought out the soft side of Bill Belichick, then
the Jets defensive coordinator. Belichick tore himself away from
game tapes long enough to keep in regular contact. There were
get-well cards from Belichick, and phone calls and visits.
Belichick's three kids even baked cookies for Williams.
</P>
<P>
   ``We talked about a lot of things,'' Belichick said. ``I
probably learned more from him than he learned from me.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams is 25. He came to the Jets three seasons ago as a
third-round draft choice out of Oklahoma State. He made an
impression _ the wrong kind _ in his first NFL game, misplaying
what should have been an interception to give the San Francisco
49ers a touchdown in the final minutes of the 1998 season opener.
Garrison Hearst steamrolled over Williams on the way to a
game-winning touchdown run in overtime. By season's end, Williams
had lost his starting job.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know there are a lot of things that I've got for me to do,''
Williams said. ``It was a long way, but anything worth having is
worth working for and waiting for.''
</P>
<P>
   His mother, Velma, kept a bedside vigil throughout the hospital
stay. Before his third surgery, she prayed in his room. She sang.
She read him Bible verses. She convinced herself that everything
would be all right, because really, what else could a mother dare
believe?
</P>
<P>
   Believe what you will. Kevin Williams cannot produce hard
evidence beyond the fact that he's still among the living, but he
can offer his testimony.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm glad that God has blessed me with another chance to be out
here,'' Williams said. ``You don't want to see anybody go through
that. I wouldn't wish it on anybody. I'm just glad that it happened
the way it did.
</P>
<P>
   ``If that happened just so somebody could see my story and maybe
do something a little bit different in their life, feel a little
bit different about something, remember the people who love them
... if it was for me to go through that just to help somebody else,
then I don't mind.''

Our rating: 2 stars 
By GLENN WHIPP 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's been a bad year for Brazil at the movies. First there was
the disjointed romance ``Bossa Nova,'' which, at the very least,
had some gorgeous vistas and a soundtrack that included masters
like Antonio Carlos Jobim and Joao Gilberto. Now comes ``Woman on
Top,'' a rather tepid knock-off of ``Like Water for Chocolate.''
Again, though, there's some great music and plenty of lovely
scenery, this time in the form of actress Penelope Cruz.
</P>
<P>
   Cruz won't likely be featuring this movie on a resume that will
soon feature works with noted directors like Cameron Crowe and John
Madden. It's not that ``Woman on Top'' is awful; it's just
eminently forgettable. What you'll remember is the sight of the
sexy Cruz in a slinky red dress, her enchanting presence elevating
a bland cooking comedy that strains _ and usually fails _ to make
cinematic magic.
</P>
<P>
   Cruz stars as Isabella, a beautiful Brazilian blessed with
extraordinary cooking abilities but cursed with a severe motion
sickness. Her affliction means she has to be in control or ``on
top'' in most of her daily activities, whether it be driving,
dancing or lovemaking.
</P>
<P>
   Isabella and her husband Toninho (Murilo Benicio) run a seaside
restaurant, sharing a passion for cooking that usually leads to
another form of passion. Toninho is generally content to take the
credit for his wife's dishes, but his frustration over his
perceived subordination in the bedroom causes him to seek solace
with another woman. Isabella, understandably upset, flees to San
Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Once she has arrived in The City, a magic spell lands Isabella a
television cooking show, a transvestite roommate (Harold Perrineau
Jr.) and a new love interest (Mark Feuerstein). Toninho won't let
go, though, and Isabella must ultimately decide if revenge, indeed,
is a dish best served cold.
</P>
<P>
   ``Woman on Top'' doesn't work for several reasons, chief of
which is Vera Blasi's cliched, watered-down screenplay, which seems
to have been dulled to make the proceedings more palatable to
general audiences. It doesn't work. Neither does Fina Torres'
direction, since the film's acting and comic timing are typically
unsavory.
</P>
<P>
   Only the charming Cruz remains unscathed, waiting for an
American film that will fully use her talents. And given her list
of upcoming movies, Cruz shouldn't have to cool her heels too much
longer. &QL; 
---``WOMAN ON TOP'' &QL; 
(Rated R: some strong sexuality and language.) &QL; 
The stars: Penelope Cruz, Murilo Benicio, Harold Perrineau Jr.,
Mark Feuerstein. Behind the scenes: Directed by Fina Torres.
Screenplay by Vera Blasi. Running time: One hour, 33 minutes.

   SCI-SRILANKA-HANDS (Undated) _ A little-known operation
developed by a German army surgeon during World War I has been used
to restore some grasping ability to people whose hands were chopped
off by military rebels during civil war in Sierra Leone, Swiss
doctors who worked for the International Red Cross have reported.
Though the operation offers a measure of independence to people who
had been rendered helpless, its use has been sharply limited
because a European aid group has discouraged it, on the ground that
the results are ugly. By Denise Grady.

<P>
   SCI-AGING-DIET (Undated) _ Gaining a sharp insight into the
nature of aging, biologists have shown in detail why a calorically
restricted diet prolongs life span. The finding, should it prove
true of people as well as of laboratory organisms, would open the
possibility of developing drugs to mimic the effects of the
draconian low-calorie diet. By Nicholas Wade.

   SCI-TREES-CLIMATE (Undated) _ Creating new plantations of
fast-growing trees to sop up heat-trapping carbon dioxide is a
strategy that is being promoted by the United States and many other
countries to slow a potentially harmful global warming. But a new
analysis concludes that young forests are not up to the job. By

   SMALL-SHOPS-INTERNET (Undated) _ For a long-time it has been
clear how so called mom-and-pop retailers would fare with the
advent of the Internet. Increased competition and the opening a
diverse array of merchandise to populations that had been
essentially captive audiences, especially in rural areas, certainly
seemed to signal a grim future. But a ``snapshot'' survey of more

the Internet is giving a strong boost to sales in store-front

to reap extraordinary profits because of underwriting and advising

percent. By Kenneth N. Gilpin.

<P>
   LOW-POWER-RADIO (Washington) _ The FCC tries to move its
low-power radio proposal forward over the growing objections of
National Public Radio and many important lawmakers by preparing new
regulations (to be issued in final form on Thursday or Friday) that
would deflect some of the criticisms of the plan by making it
easier for existing radio stations to file complaints about signal

 By DAGEN McDOWELL  
 c.2000 TheStreet.com  
<TEXT>
<P>
   You'll rarely find a Janus fund manager talking about picking
stocks.
</P>
<P>
   But on Tuesday, five portfolio managers from the firm gathered
to do just that.
</P>
<P>
   The Janus fund's Blaine Rollins, the Olympus fund's Claire
Young, David Decker of the Janus Special Situations and Strategic
Value funds, Laurence Chang, who co-manages Worldwide and Overseas,
and Marc Pinto, who manages institutional assets at the firm,
gathered in Denver for Charles Schwab's Impact 2000 conference for
investment advisers.
</P>
<P>
   These five managers sat down for 90 minutes to discuss how
they're coping with the Janus' explosive growth, how they feel
about their shareholders and _ most importantly _ how they're
investing your money.
</P>
<P>
   THE NEW ECONOMY
</P>
<P>
   Blaine Rollins, manager of the now-closed Janus fund, said
investing in the New Economy means finding companies that are using
technology to leverage their existing businesses and to make more
money.
</P>
<P>
   Rollins pointed to GE Medical Systems, a division of General
Electric that makes diagnostic imaging equipment such as ultrasound
scanners.
</P>
<P>
   The division is taking the information used to sell and service
its machines and putting it on the Web so it can be accessed
directly by the technicians who use these devices. This makes the
customers happy and frees up the salespeople, who can now spend 100
percent of their time selling new machines.
</P>
<P>
   DIG, DIG, DIG
</P>
<P>
   You've probably seen those cryptic Janus TV commercials that
tout the firm's research prowess along with a few unnamed
investment gems.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the ads, you want more details about how the Janus
managers investigate companies. In a nutshell: They travel
constantly and will go wherever necessary to learn more about a
company's industry or business.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes they don't have to go far. Laurence Chang said
managers recently attended a national fiber-optics conference in
the firm's hometown of Denver, meeting with 50 companies in three
days. Many of the companies were private, but it still gave them a
good overview of the entire emerging industry.
</P>
<P>
   When they visit the companies themselves, the Janus managers
will meet with company executives, but they'll also talk to regular
employees who can see a business improving _ or failing _ at the
ground level.
</P>
<P>
   FAIR DISCLOSURE EQUALS LESS DISCLOSURE?
</P>
<P>
   The Securities and Exchange Commission's new rules on fair
disclosure are meant to make information more available to
individual investors and to end selective disclosure of information
by corporations. Many Wall Street watchers have voiced concerns
that big-name fund families such as Janus will suffer from a dearth
of privileged information.
</P>
<P>
   Some investment professionals have raised concerns that
so-called Regulation FD will hinder their ability to effectively
research companies, which will now be less open to talking.
</P>
<P>
   When asked how the SEC rules will affect Janus, Rollins said
that the new fair disclosure rule hasn't affected the way the Janus
managers research companies, although he conceded that some
companies are being noticeably quiet.
</P>
<P>
   The Janus managers, he said, don't just rely on a company's
management when researching a company, adding that he doesn't need
to ``have some CEO blow some smoke my way to keep me in the
stock.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, they go to a company's customers to dig up information.
Rollins cited a trip to New York to meet with the biggest users of
computer-storage products manufactured by firms like EMC. They
talked to the chief technology officers at big brokerage firms and
banks to find out what their spending needs might be.
</P>
<P>
   SAME STOCKS, DIFFERENT FUNDS
</P>
<P>
   The Janus funds have gotten the reputation _ rightfully so _ for
owning many of the same stocks. Nokia, for example, has been the
top holding of several of the family's funds. But the managers do
disagree on some companies.
</P>
<P>
   David Decker, as manager of the Strategic Value fund, pays close
attention to the growth rate he'll get for the amount of valuation
risk he must bear. He wants to provide good upside and limit the
downside. With Sun Microsystems and its high price, Decker isn't
willing to take on that risk.
</P>
<P>
   Olympus fund's Claire Young, on the other hand, likes Sun and
owns it. Mentioning the company's telecommunications services
business, she said Janus' growth estimates for Sun are ``10 to 20
percentage points higher than Wall Street's estimates.''
</P>
<P>
   GRAPPLING WITH GROWTH
</P>
<P>
   When asked how the firm is managing the tremendous asset growth
in the funds, Rollins quickly blurted out, ``We're closing them
all.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the comment got a laugh, that's not far from the truth.
</P>
<P>
   With the closing of the $50 billion Janus fund, half of the
firm's funds that are sold directly to investors are now closed to
new investors. (Janus is planning to open a Janus 2.)
</P>
<P>
   Continuing to build the firm's research department is key in
managing this growth. Chang said that the research department has
added eight more analysts this year _ young people right out of
undergraduate school _ bringing the department's staff up to 50
people. Plus, the firm has enhanced its mentoring program, which is
used to train these green analysts.
</P>
<P>
   EURO WOES
</P>
<P>
   The euro's collapse this year has definitely hurt Janus'
international funds. Chang said that his funds partially hedged
their currency exposure this year, but the euro's fall has hurt
returns.
</P>
<P>
   MANAGERS MAKE MISTAKES
</P>
<P>
   Rollins was the manager most willing to admit his past mistakes.
A bad bet on Electronic Data Systems cost him his entire bonus one
year. This year Rollins' biggest mistake was Lucent. It
``completely hit the wall,'' said Rollins, calling the controls in
the company ``terrible'' and the research and development rollout
of new products ``a mess.''
</P>
<P>
   SHAREHOLDER LOYALTY
</P>
<P>
   Amid their success, the Janus managers haven't forgotten about
their shareholders. ``I know every day who I am working for,'' said
Young, who said she has every shareholder letter that she has ever
received tacked up on her office wall.
</P>
<P>
   Young was quite emotional when recalling one letter she received
from a widow who could retire thanks to her investment in the
Olympus fund.
</P>
<P>
   THE FUTURE
</P>
<P>
   It has been a big year for Janus. The firm has experienced
astounding growth in its funds and some notable changes with the
recent departure of Chief Investment Officer Jim Craig and the
closing of several of the firm's funds. Also, performance has paled
in comparison to last year's incredible returns. Rollins insisted
that ``Morale couldn't be better.''
</P>
<P>
   More importantly, these Janus managers sent the message that
they're concentrating on what they know best: researching stocks.
</P>
<P>
   With Janus undergoing changes and the market in choppy water,
the managers made the rare public appearance to placate any
lingering jitters: They're still traveling nonstop, touring company
factories and talking to myriad people about the stocks they own or
might own.
</P>
<P>
   That has certainly worked in the past.

MERCEDES CL500: CLEAN LINES, CLEAN RIDE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (l and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROYAL FORD  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   There was a time when, if you played a word association game
using automobiles, the cue would be ``tank'' and an appropriate
response would be ``Mercedes-Benz.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, that answer could be challenged, because what
tank-builder, after all, would shroud their best machine in
plastic, aluminum, and mangesium and use good-ol' hard steel only
at its skeleton?
</P>
<P>
   That's just what Mercedes has done with the CL500 Coupe, a
much-lighter-than-predecessor (by about a quarter of a ton) wedge
of luxury performance that would fit nicely in the garage with a
Porsche 911 or Jaguar XKR. And if you can afford any of the last
two, you can certainly pony up the $90,000 to add the CL500 to your
stable.
</P>
<P>
   From the outside, it is a very pretty automobile. Distinctive
Mercedes grille tops a three-opening fascia that has intricate
fenced meshwork that harkens back to early '60s sports car. Its
lines are clean, kept wonderfully so by the absence of a center
pillar, giving the four-seater the look of something smaller and
snappier.
</P>
<P>
   Beneath the hood beats a 5.0-liter, SOHC, 24-valve V8 that
quietly thumps out 302 horsepower and an impressive 339 lb.-ft. of
torque. It's plenty of power for a car that weighs just over two
tons. Mercedes kept the weight down by building the CL500 in an
intricate weave of plastic front fenders and trunk lid, aluminum
roof, rear fenders, and hood, and magnesium inner doors. Try
explaining that one to the auto body guy with the hammer at ACME
Bump and Grind.
</P>
<P>
   You begin looking at this car at just over $85,000, and for that
you get such amenities as automatic climate control; leather
upholstery; wood trim; infrared glass; a 10-speaker sound system;
navigation system; heated, 14-way power seats; and airbags all
about you, front, side, and curtain.
</P>
<P>
   You roll up to 90 grand when you toss in climate comfort seats
(besides heating your butt, they'll move cool air through
perforated leather to cool it), an electric rear window shade, and
air-pulse contour seats that will massage your lumbar. Oh, and
you'll also pay a $1,000 gas-guzzler tax. I got just over 17 miles
per gallon in 10 days in the CL500.
</P>
<P>
   For this, you get great comfort. Four passengers, four leather
buckets. Great head- and legroom. The front seats slide forward on
automatic power to make getting in and out of the rear easier.
Storage is everywhere _ in the doors, in the center console, in
pouches behind the seats, in covered bins beneath the front seats.
</P>
<P>
   The only interior complaint I have with the CL500 is the
complicated set of climate/sound/navigation controls at center
dash. There are myriad buttons, many looking alike, making them
hard to figure out, especially while rolling. The navigation system
is complicated beyond necessity. And while I know you are not
supposed to program this system while driving because your eyes
should not be on that center screen, it was disconcerting to have
to watch the screen if I wanted to manually set, digit by digit,
the call numbers of a radio station I wanted while driving.
</P>
<P>
   That's something that needs cleaning up.
</P>
<P>
   What was absolutely crisp and clean was the ride and handling of
this car. It's got the usual goodies: ABS, vented discs, gas
shocks. But at its heart is a state-of-the-art Active Body Control
system.
</P>
<P>
   In basic terms, here's how it works. At each wheel there are
hydraulic cylinders that answer to a sensor. The cylinders can
apply downward pressure at each wheel as weight shifts. Say you
stomp on the brakes at high speed. The car wants to nose-dive as
weight hurtles forward. The front cylinders are pressurized, the
rear cylinders relaxed, and the car remains flat.
</P>
<P>
   To try this out, get down on your hands, knees bent. Put hard
pressure down on your hands even as you stiffen your elbows and let
weight flow back to your knees. That's ABC. It also works side to
side, applying pressure to the front and rear wheels on the outside
of a turn.
</P>
<P>
   And you can feel it. This car can be stomped to a stop or rolled
very fast even into a down-sloping corner, and it balances itself.
The ABC works in addition to the gas shocks, and in comfort mode,
as opposed to sport mode (ABC at work), it has the softness of a
cross-country sedan.
</P>
<P>
   Yet even in comfort mode, where it is soft and straight on the
highway, it holds flat in corners, able to handle all the power the
engine cranks out.
</P>
<P>
   That notion may get tested, however, for the 2001 model year.
That's when the CL600 hits the market. That car will have more than
360-horsepower, produced by a sequential V6-V12 engine that
promises to test some limits.

<P>
   Nice Touch:
</P>
<P>
   --The vents at the rear of the solid sunroof (which closes
beneath a tinted glass sunroof). When the car is hot and you want
to cool it quickly without exposing your head to the sun, you open
the glass roof, close the solid roof, and let the fans push the hot
air out through the vents.
</P>
<P>
   Annoyance:
</P>
<P>
   --Can someone tell me why, oh why, even in a $90,000 car, the
Germans seem incapable of building an AM radio that does not
crackle and buzz once you are but a few miles from a broadcast
source?

JUST WONDERING: WHY DOES VW SAY IT'S OK TO BURN OIL? 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (l and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROYAL FORD  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   More from the days of miracle and wonder, once again heavy on
the wondering . . ..
</P>
<P>
   --After a letter arrived from a guy on Cape Cod wondering why
his elderly father had been told it was normal for his new
Volkswagen Jetta to burn a quart of oil every 1,000 miles, I went
looking for an answer. One public relations guy at Volkswagen,
calling me from the middle of a business trip, said that didn't
sound right. So that's what I wrote a couple of weeks back.
</P>
<P>
   Well, lo and behold, the phone calls and e-mails became deluge.
Volkswagen owners _ of Beetles, Jettas, Golfs, GTIs _ let me know
that that had been their experience as well. So what's a wondering
mind to do? Another call to Volkswagen, and this time an engineer
got on the case.
</P>
<P>
   This will come as a surprise to you, as it did to me, but
Volkswagen says that burning a quart of oil for each 1,000 miles
driven _ up to around 15,000 _ is perfectly normal. In fact, they
recommend that if you are the owner of a new Volkswagen, you check
the oil level every second filling of your gasoline tank.
</P>
<P>
   It's still not clear to me why, in this day and age, it makes
sense to build a car that burns that much oil over a long break-in
period, or even why the cars use up oil like that in the first
place. And don't get me wrong. I think VWs are some of the best
cars on the market today. But on the oil thing, we'll just have to
wonder some more until I can get a clear technical explanation.
It's not as if Volkswagen is the only company building high-rev,
powerful, small engines (Audi, VW's partner, says their cars, too,
use oil the same way during break-in, though they are not as
specific on quantity or how long it will last), but I certainly
have heard of no other cars that consume oil like this.
</P>
<P>
   Anybody out there have an answer? I'm wondering.
</P>
<P>
   --And I'm wondering, too, about just how remarkably prescient a
caption writer for a magazine called Modern Tire Dealer (you
probably don't get this one at home) was when, for the August
issue, he wrote a caption beneath a picture of an SUV with big
tires and fancy wheels. Now keep in mind that this issue came just
as the Firestone/Bridgestone/Ford tire problem was reaching its
peak.
</P>
<P>
   But right there, beneath the picture, was a caption that
proclaimed, ``The SUV wheel and tire market is exploding . . ..''
</P>
<P>
   --And speaking of shredding tires, when I wrote about the Mark
Donohue book ``The Unfair Advantage,'' last week and called him my
pick as best all-around race driver ever, I admit I held out a gem
just for this column. Again, it makes you wonder.
</P>
<P>
   Because in that book, Donohue recounts a time on a race track in
the mid-'60s when he was trying to get a Shelby Cobra in tune with
the track he was running on. He was having tire problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``. . . every time I got up on the banks I could hear a
`sq-sq-sq-sq-sq,' and I just kept thinking, `Christ, when is it
going to go?' '' He was referring to a spongy tire, which did
indeed blow. He was bucking for a permanent seat in a car at that
point so he didn't want to offend potential backers, he wrote.
</P>
<P>
   ``So when the tire blew, I didn't want to tell anybody . . .,''
he wrote. ``So I said, `Well, I ran over some glass and the tire
blew.''
</P>
<P>
   The kicker to this tale?
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't want Firestone to look bad . . .. I gave the tire to
the Firestone guys and they went and hid it, but it was shredded on
the inside.''
</P>
<P>
   Plus c'est change . . . as they say.
</P>
<P>
   --So I write reviews of big, gas-guzzling SUVs _ write them
because that's what people are buying _ and each time I get
barraged with mail from SUV-haters asking how I can be so
irresponsible as to write about these safety- and
environmentally-challenged beasts.
</P>
<P>
   Yet I write a Page One story about a batch of dedicated college
students, working in concert with General Motors to produce the
SUVs of the future _ SUVs that burn far less fuel and run far
cleaner and have added safety features _ and how much response is
there from those critics? Zero.
</P>
<P>
   --I wondered some time back about Saab and why it is lagging in
offering an all-wheel-drive vehicle. Its Viggen, a true rocket of a
car with disconcerting torque steer, seemed to me reason enough for
them to go all-wheel drive.
</P>
<P>
   Audi, which is in the midst of converting its entire line to
performance sedans and sports cars, and which builds probably the
best AWD system in the world, may just show Saab how it's done. Ah,
but is Saab already headed there?
</P>
<P>
   Take a look at the picture accompanying this column.
</P>
<P>
   That's a picture of a 9-3 Viggen, with rally driver Per Eklund
at the wheel, running the famous Adephelia Pikes Peak International
Hill Climb. He won the Open Class and finished with the second
fastest overall time of the day.
</P>
<P>
   ``The 9-3 Viggen was perfect today,'' Eklund said.
</P>
<P>
   Now look again at the photo. Notice the dirt spinning back from
the front tires as they bite? That's normal for a Saab,
front-wheel-drive rocket that it is. Now, look at the rear wheels.
What's going on here?
</P>
<P>
   Though it seems obvious, I checked out the technical specs on
Eklund's Viggen and, wouldn't you know, there was the answer:
``Transmission: four-wheel drive with programmable active
differentials.''
</P>
<P>
   Have we seen the future? I wonder.
</P>
<P>
   --I wonder, too, about some folks' choice in vanity plates. Once
in a while you see a clever one _ HOGWILD, on a
Harley-Davidson/Ford F-150 _ and some are just plan sappy, as in
IGO4U. But the ones that baffle me are the plates that people have
paid extra money for just to tell you what kind of car the plate is
attached to.
</P>
<P>
   Saw one the other day that said VOLVO. Hooked right onto, you
guessed it, a Volvo. I've seen Beemer, Chevy, and Saab3 (meaning, I
suppose, that Saab, Saab1, and Saab2 were taken).
</P>
<P>
   And my favorites in this category are the ones that proclaim
ownership. MYBMW, MYSAAB.
</P>
<P>
   What, you think we think the car was stolen? Now SWIPED, that
would show some derring-do.
</P>
<P>
   Hey, it makes you wonder.

old crockery, silverware, etchings, mother-of-pearl folding fans,

<P>
   HERMOSA BEACH, Costa Rica _ From 120 feet up in a tree in the
Costa Rican rainforest, the view of the broad, blue Pacific is
breath taking.
</P>
<P>
   You can hear howler monkeys up here, jabbering as they dance
among the branches. You might even spot a bright-winged quetzal
bird, a cute sloth or a slow-moving iguana creeping along the
forest floor.
</P>
<P>
   That's if you keep still.
</P>
<P>
   But on the Chiclets Canopy Tour, keeping still is the last thing
you do.
</P>
<P>
   You're too busy gasping for breath as you plunge off the tiny
wooden platforms lashed in the high treetops. One step and whoosh,
you're zipping down a steel cable, plummeting through the branches,
securely suspended from a harness and pulley, screaming your head
off at the rush.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wow,'' gushed one gringo tourist, sweating from the tropical
heat and the excitement as she zipped from one high platform to
another. ``They don't have anything like this in Orlando! The
lawyers would never let them.''
</P>
<P>
   Costa Rica was a pioneer in the field of eco-tourism in the
1980s, turning its lush landscape of rumbling volcanoes, high cloud
forests, rushing mountain streams, vibrant rainforests and gorgeous
deserted beaches into a nature-lover's vacation paradise.
</P>
<P>
   In the past decade, the Central American hideaway has put action
into the mix.
</P>
<P>
   Visitors can raft through raging whitewater streams, mountain
bike through dense forests, kayak along unspoiled rocky beaches,
windsurf on a stunning lake in the shadow of a smoking volcano,
explore the azure Caribbean in scuba gear, horseback ride through
the rainforest or surf some of the world's best waves.
</P>
<P>
   For more tranquil souls, there are butterfly farms, orchid
farms, teak reserves, bird- and nature-watching tours, and hikes
along the rim of a volcano. There are also canopy tours high in the
rainforest treetops that let you walk on swinging bridges or ride
in suspended tramcars instead of launching into the great void
clipped to a steel cable with a harness.
</P>
<P>
   But don't think you have to be a high-adventure junkie or an
eco-freak to enjoy a trip to Costa Rica.
</P>
<P>
   There's also plenty of traditional vacation fare, including
deserted beaches perfect for meandering, sparkling new golf
courses, five-star hotels, day-sailing trips to nowhere, and
casinos and discos offering plenty of night-time action.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is so much to do here,'' said Dave Klostermann, 40, a
California transplant who now runs a horseback-riding outfit in the
Pacific coast surf town of Jaco Beach. ``You can ride horses on a
gorgeous beach, kayak, white-water raft, mountain-bike, surf or
take a canopy tour. But it's also a great place to just hang out
and relax.''
</P>
<P>
   The message appears to be getting out. Costa Rica is now Central
America's top tourism destination, luring more than 1 million
visitors in 1999 who spent nearly US$1 billion.
</P>
<P>
   They are drawn by the tiny country's natural beauty, the long
list of activities and Costa Rica's reputation as a peaceful,
relatively prosperous oasis in the midst of a region marred by
poverty, civil war and unstable governments.
</P>
<P>
   While its neighbors spent decades embroiled in wars and
dictatorships, Costa Rica abolished its army in 1949, investing the
money in developing the country's infrastructure and social
services.
</P>
<P>
   Visionary leaders also jumped on the conservation bandwagon
early, and have set aside nearly 25 percent of Costa Rica's
territory as nature preserves or national parks. There are more
than 75 such parks in the country.
</P>
<P>
   The country offers a staggering array of flora and fauna: more
than 9,000 species of plants, including 1,200 varieties of orchids
and 800 different types of ferns. As for animals, there are more
than 850 species of birds, while 10 percent of the world's
butterflies call Costa Rica home. There are more than 5,000
different species of grasshoppers.
</P>
<P>
   And it's all so close together. Wedged between Nicaragua and
Panama, with the Caribbean to the east and the Pacific Ocean to the
west, Costa Rica is only 200 miles long. You can drive almost
anywhere in the country within a day _ although be warned: the
roads are notoriously rough and can be dangerous after dark as
livestock and wild animals like to bed down on the warm pavement.
</P>
<P>
   But driving around Costa Rica is fun. Rent a car in the Central
Highlands at th capital, San Jose, and within a half-hour, you can
be hugging curves on a high mountain road, zipping past coffee
bushes planted on unbelievably steep terraces.
</P>
<P>
   An hour later and you can be standing on the rim of the Poas
Volcano, or dodging drops at the La Paz waterfall. Half an hour
more and you can be touring a butterfly farm, then hiking in the
rainforest.
</P>
<P>
   The country is actually made up of several distinct ``climate
zones,'' and the weather can vary from hot and dry to summer
monsoon to surprisingly brisk. The rainy season runs from May to
December, and the high tourist season, which is dry, lasts from
January until May.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the most popular destinations are:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Arenal Volcano, about five hours northwest of San Jose. This
5,000-foot peak is one of the country's most active, and regularly
throws off showers of sparks and smoke. Hiking to the rim is not
recommended, although you can hike along the slopes and see plenty
of dramatic action.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  You can also windsurf on Lake Arenal in the volcano's shadow,
enjoying some of the most predictable high-wind conditions in the
world. Rental equipment is available at several resorts.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Also in this area is the Monteverde Cloud Forest Biological
Preserve, which has earned a reputation as one of the most
outstanding tropical reserves in the Americas. Take a guided tour
and you may glimpse any of the hundreds of species of animals
living here, from pumas to exotic moths to 30 species of
hummingbirds.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  About three hours southwest of San Jose, beach-lovers flock to
Manuel Antonio National Park, a small but gorgeous park bordering
the blue Pacific. Visitors can sun on magnificent white sand
beaches, or hike through the park's rainforest, where they are
almost guaranteed to see monkeys, sloths, scarlet macaws and other
exotic wildlife.
</P>
<P>
   Be careful with your beach picnic, as the monkeys are notorious
thieves.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  For whitewater rafting, enthusiasts have their choice of
multi-day trips that include camping by the river or one-day
excursions that range from the relatively tranquil Rio Corobici to
wild, high-adrenaline rapids on the Rio Reventazon. More than a
half-dozen companies offer guided trips, with most departing from
San Jose.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  For those interested in a more relaxing time, several
companies offer daylong sailing cruises on both the Caribbean and
the Pacific. Most stop on nearby islands, and some offer gourmet
picnic lunches so that visitors can delight their palates as well
as soak up sun and sand.
</P>
<P>
   While Costa Rica has been in the news lately for a few
high-profile crimes against tourists, most veteran travelers will
recognize that it is still much safer than other Latin American
countries. Petty theft is a problem, but robberies and more serious
crimes are still rare. Visitors who take reasonable precautions
should have few problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``Costa Rica really is a utopia,'' said David Reid, 56, owner of
Calypso Tours, who moved to Costa Rica 30 years ago and helped
pioneer the country's tourism offerings with his daylong cruise and
gourmet lunch adventure. ``It's such a beautiful place. There are
more people now than before, but there's still so much to do and
see.''

</P>
<P>
   IF YOU GO:
</P>
<P>
   WHEN TO GO: The rainy season runs from May until December. The
dry season, which lasts from January to May, is the most popular
time to visit. However, prices are higher during the dry season and
it doesn't rain all the time during the wet season, so you might
consider a summer visit. Climate ranges from cool in the central
highlands year-round to steamy along the coasts during the summer.
</P>
<P>
   GETTING THERE: Many major U.S. carriers, including American,
Delta and Continental, have daily flights to San Jose, Costa Rica's
capital, from cities including Houston, Atlanta and Miami.
</P>
<P>
   GETTING AROUND: All international flights arrive in the capital,
and unless you are staying at an all-inclusive resort that offers
transportation, you'll likely need a rental car. Traffic is bad in
San Jose, but outside the capital, it thins out and driving can be
a gorgeous adventure, with curvy mountain roads and stunning views.
Watch for potholes and road repair crews, as well as livestock and
rural residents, who use the highway as a sidewalk. You will need a
4-wheel-drive vehicle during the rainy season if you plan to visit
a volcano or rainforest.
</P>
<P>
   WHERE TO STAY: In San Jose, you can find everything from US$15
barebones rooms to a luxurious new five-star Marriott built in the
midst of an old coffee plantation, where rooms start at US$150 a
night. Outside the capital, there are lots of hotels with varying
price ranges in the most popular tourist destinations, including
Puerto Viejo and Limon on the Caribbean and Tamarindo, Jaco Beach
and Quepos on the Pacific side.
</P>
<P>
   SECURITY: Crime against tourists has unfortunately been
increasing in Costa Rica but the country is still relatively safe
compared to other Latin destinations. Petty theft is very common so
don't leave items unattended, even in a locked car. Take the same
common-sense precautions as in other strange places: don't walk
alone at night; don't carry and flash lots of cash; be wary of
over-friendly strangers.
</P>
<P>
   LANGUAGE: The native Costa Ricans, called ``Ticos,'' speak
Spanish, but most tourism-related businesses have English-speakers.
Even in the remote countryside, Ticos are accustomed to dealing
with tourists and you'll probably get by fine even if you don't
even know how to order a ``cerveza,'' (beer) in Spanish.
</P>
<P>
   ACTIVITIES: The list is nearly endless. There's whitewater
rafting, mountain-biking, hiking, bird-watching,
butterfly-watching, rainforest canopy tours, cloud forest tours,
volcanoes you can hike or drive up, windsurfing, surfing, scuba
diving, beach-combing, golf, tennis, sailing and sport-fishing.
</P>
<P>
   The best thing to do is decide which activities you want to try
and build a vacation around them. You could start in San Jose, do a
day-trip to whitewater raft, then rent a car and drive to the
Pacific coast for some beachtime and a tour of a rainforest. Then
move on to the Arenal Volcano and the Monteverde Cloud Forest
Preserve.

<P>
   HERMOSA BEACH, Costa Rica _ From 120 feet up in a tree in the
Costa Rican rainforest, the view of the broad, blue Pacific is
breath taking.
</P>
<P>
   You can hear howler monkeys up here, jabbering as they dance
among the branches. You might even spot a bright-winged quetzal
bird, a cute sloth or a slow-moving iguana creeping along the
forest floor.
</P>
<P>
   That's if you keep still.
</P>
<P>
   But on the Chiclets Canopy Tour, keeping still is the last thing
you do.
</P>
<P>
   You're too busy gasping for breath as you plunge off the tiny
wooden platforms lashed in the high treetops. One step and whoosh,
you're zipping down a steel cable, plummeting through the branches,
securely suspended from a harness and pulley, screaming your head
off at the rush.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wow,'' gushed one gringo tourist, sweating from the tropical
heat and the excitement as she zipped from one high platform to
another. ``They don't have anything like this in Orlando! The
lawyers would never let them.''
</P>
<P>
   Costa Rica was a pioneer in the field of eco-tourism in the
1980s, turning its lush landscape of rumbling volcanoes, high cloud
forests, rushing mountain streams, vibrant rainforests and gorgeous
deserted beaches into a nature-lover's vacation paradise.
</P>
<P>
   In the past decade, the Central American hideaway has put action
into the mix.
</P>
<P>
   Visitors can raft through raging whitewater streams, mountain
bike through dense forests, kayak along unspoiled rocky beaches,
windsurf on a stunning lake in the shadow of a smoking volcano,
explore the azure Caribbean in scuba gear, horseback ride through
the rainforest or surf some of the world's best waves.
</P>
<P>
   For more tranquil souls, there are butterfly farms, orchid
farms, teak reserves, bird- and nature-watching tours, and hikes
along the rim of a volcano. There are also canopy tours high in the
rainforest treetops that let you walk on swinging bridges or ride
in suspended tramcars instead of launching into the great void
clipped to a steel cable with a harness.
</P>
<P>
   But don't think you have to be a high-adventure junkie or an
eco-freak to enjoy a trip to Costa Rica.
</P>
<P>
   There's also plenty of traditional vacation fare, including
deserted beaches perfect for meandering, sparkling new golf
courses, five-star hotels, day-sailing trips to nowhere, and
casinos and discos offering plenty of night-time action.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is so much to do here,'' said Dave Klostermann, 40, a
California transplant who now runs a horseback-riding outfit in the
Pacific coast surf town of Jaco Beach. ``You can ride horses on a
gorgeous beach, kayak, white-water raft, mountain-bike, surf or
take a canopy tour. But it's also a great place to just hang out
and relax.''
</P>
<P>
   The message appears to be getting out. Costa Rica is now Central
America's top tourism destination, luring more than 1 million
visitors in 1999 who spent nearly US$1 billion.
</P>
<P>
   They are drawn by the tiny country's natural beauty, the long
list of activities and Costa Rica's reputation as a peaceful,
relatively prosperous oasis in the midst of a region marred by
poverty, civil war and unstable governments.
</P>
<P>
   While its neighbors spent decades embroiled in wars and
dictatorships, Costa Rica abolished its army in 1949, investing the
money in developing the country's infrastructure and social
services.
</P>
<P>
   Visionary leaders also jumped on the conservation bandwagon
early, and have set aside nearly 25 percent of Costa Rica's
territory as nature preserves or national parks. There are more
than 75 such parks in the country.
</P>
<P>

<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia _ An inexplicable error made in the
measurement of the vault apparatus during the women's Olympic
all-around final Thursday night cast doubt on the validity of the
outcome and may have cost the former world champion, Svetlana
Khorkina, a chance to win a medal.
</P>
<P>
   As controversy about the error roiled backstage at the Super
Dome, the dominant Romanians were claiming every space on the medal
stand. Unflustered by the situation, Romania became the first
country to have its gymnasts take the gold, silver and bronze
medals since the former Soviet Union swept the event in 1960.
</P>
<P>
   But as a joyful Andreea Raducan was accepting her gold medal
after her spectacular night, as the silver medalist Simona Amanar
waved to the crowd, and while Maria Olaru gripped her bronze medal
tightly, an angry Khorkina told reporters to ``get lost'' and left
the arena.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps more than anyone, the graceful Russian was affected by
the measurement blunder made by the technical personnel from the
Federal Internationale de Gymnastique, the governing body for the
sport.
</P>
<P>
   Through the first two of the four vault rotations _ during which
18 of the 36 gymnasts competed _ the block was 120 centimeters
(just over 47 inches) above the floor instead of the mandatory 125
centimeters (just over 49 inches). The nearly two-inch difference
in height threw off the timing and technique of several gymnasts.
</P>
<P>
   Just before the third rotation, an Australian gymnast, Allana
Slater, questioned the height of the apparatus. Officials then
readjusted it. Once the competition ended, competitors in the first
two rotations were given a chance to vault again. But the
psychological damage had been done, particularly in Khorkina's
case.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian diva of gymnastics led the competition after her
floor exercise, but crashed badly on her next event, the vault,
landing on her knees and bumping her head into the mat. She scored
a dreadful 9.025. By the end of the rotation, she had plunged into
10th place.
</P>
<P>
   ``She is our No. 1 gymnast,'' said Valery Dianov, a Russian team
official, speaking through an interpreter. ``We expected her to be
an Olympic champion. But that jump, the vault was too low. She was
emotionally depressed.''
</P>
<P>
   Still visibly upset, Khorkina then became unraveled on her
signature event, the uneven bars. Two moves on the apparatus are
named after her, but with her psyche in tatters, she fell on a
daring release move she usually handles easily.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like she said, `Welcome to my nightmare,''' said the
former American gold-medalist Peter Vidmar, an analyst for NBC.
``When she blew the vault, the tears came. She knew it was all
over. When she got on the uneven bars, all the wind was out of her
sails.''
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the night, Khorkina did not choose to vault again.
She was in 11th place, and after her fall on the uneven bars, not
even a perfect score would have put her on the medal stand.
Instead, she sat in a huff, talked on a cell phone, and looked
disgusted by the situation. But Elise Ray, of Columbia, Md.,
decided to re-vault, and stood as proof of just how much about two
inches can mean.
</P>
<P>
   She had no chance at a medal, but she knew she was better than
the 35th spot she occupied thanks in large part to her 7.618 score
after two horrific landings on the vault. With the vault block at
standard height, her mechanics were uninfluenced. She stuck her
landing and replaced her disastrous score in the first rotation
with a 9.487. With that, Ray rocketed 21 spots through the
standings. Instead of an embarrassingly low finish, the U.S.
national champion ended up in 14th place.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know what was wrong,'' Ray said. ``It looked low to
me, but I thought it was my nerves. Definitely falling on your
first event shoots your confidence way down. That was the toughest
part, just to keep going.''
</P>
<P>
   This was the first time in memory that such an error was made at
the Olympics. Although many gymnasts were upset, Slava Corn, a
gymnastics federation official, said the athletes had no recourse
in this type of situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never seen anything like this,'' U.S. Coach Kelli Hill
said. ``At the Olympics? It's unbelievable.''
</P>
<P>
   There is a system of checks and double-checks for the equipment.
The technical staff makes the measurements, then there are
officials and judges who make visual scans of the apparatus.
Somehow, the vault escaped everyone's attention until Slater did
the math.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know where I stand next to the vault, and I know how high it
is on me,'' Slater said. ``You don't think of something like this
happening at the Olympics. It could have totally changed
everything.''
</P>
<P>
   There is no way of knowing what, if any, change in the outcome
would have occurred. Other gymnasts, like Raducan, were unaffected.
She was also in the marred rotation groups, but effortlessly landed
her vault with a 9.7.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Unlike the willowy Khorkina, Raducan is the template for the
gymnastic pixie. At 4-feet-10-inches tall, holding at 82 pounds,
Raducan is a pillow mint next to Khorkina. With her size, speed and
quickness, she can adjust more easily to a low vault. As Vidmar
said, ``It was like jumping a lunch box,'' for the 5-feet-4{-inch
Khorkina.
</P>
<P>
   Controversy aside, the diminutive Raducan was a strong adversary
for Khorkina. While the 21-year-old Khorkina was the world champion
in 1997 and won the European title earlier this year, the
16-year-old Raducan had risen to the level of the elite.
</P>
<P>
   She unveiled her talent on the floor exercise. Khorkina had the
top score on that event (9.812) Thursday evening until Raducan
finished off her competition with a 9.825. A product of Romania's
factory-like gymnastics system, Raducan was a vision of precision
and consistency. She had only one score below a 9.7, a 9.575 on the
uneven bars.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Raducan, and her two medal-winning teammates, were
examples of the vice grip the Romanians have on gymnastics. Once,
the Russians ruled this way. Now, it is the Romanians. Not only did
they sweep the all-around, they won the gold in the team finals
Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very excited,'' Raducan said through an interpreter. ``I
was very happy that I got the gold in the team, and I expected a
good result tonight. It was important to do my best. I am very
happy that I was able to control my emotions.''
</P>
<P>
   Raducan was unshakable. Nothing rattled her, not her own
minuscule errors, and not the one glaring mistake made by the
technical staff.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a tragedy for all the athletes,'' Vidmar said. ``For
the rest of Khorkina's life _ or for any of the gymnasts _ they'll
say, `What if?' This was something they had no control over. That's
what's sad.''  &QL;

&HT;     NINERS' WIDE RECEIVERS WANT MORE RESPECT 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By KEVIN LYNCH  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTA CLARA, Calif. _ The San Francisco 49ers are used to wide
receivers bickering about not getting the ball.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Rice, Brent Jones and John Taylor all made public appeals
for the ball over the past 10 seasons. Now it's Rice, J.J. Stokes
and Terrell Owens. And complaints from players on a 0-3 team seem
all the more pointed and controversial.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, coach Steve Mariucci and wide receivers coach
George Stewart tried to nip the budding controversy.
</P>
<P>
   It began Monday with Rice saying his cohorts should get more
passes. In the next breath Rice said he still wants to play and
would go elsewhere to finish his career, and presumably get more
passes.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Stokes said he has appealed to everyone from coaches
to secretaries about getting more opportunities. Stokes even
offered to change positions if need be.
</P>
<P>
   Owens, a close friend of Stokes, also believes Stokes should get
more passes, and even blamed the coaching staff for Stokes' lack of
involvement.
</P>
<P>
   ``With J.J., you got four guys at a position with one
football,'' Stewart said. ``I like that intensity. I like that
competitiveness. I like that intensity of what he showed against
Carolina a couple weeks ago, catching passes and scoring
touchdowns. You want him to have that passion.''
</P>
<P>
   Stokes looked as if he was reverting to his 1998 self after
catching five passes for 97 yards and a touchdown in the fourth
quarter against the Panthers. That's why it seemed incongruous that
Stokes barely got any plays, much less passes, in Sunday's loss at
St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   Mariucci said, after reviewing the game film, he was surprised
how few snaps Stokes received. On several third-receiver sets
against St. Louis, Tai Streets took Stokes' place.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know one guy is going to suffer,'' Stokes said. ``You just
don't want it to be you.''
</P>
<P>
   As an ardent Stokes supporter, Owens said he didn't always agree
with the coaches' play calling.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of plays that should be called, but that don't
get called,'' Owens said.
</P>
<P>
   Mariucci said Owens had 34 passes thrown his way, Rice 22, and
Stokes ``much less than that.'' Owens is the team's leading
receiver, despite his three drops against the Panthers, with 18
receptions, two touchdowns and a healthy 15.4 yards per catch.
</P>
<P>
   Rice is third in receiving behind running back Charlie Garner.
Rice has 11 receptions, an 11.4 yard average and one score. Stokes
is the team's fifth-leading receiver with six catches for 123 yards
and a touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   In the middle of this fray is quarterback Jeff Garcia, who has
his own problems in clinging to his starting job.
</P>
<P>
   Garcia was the object of a minor quarterback controversy last
week, and now he's trying to lead the team to more points.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm thinking about which of my reads is going to open up. I'm
thinking about the play. I'm thinking about the defense,'' Garcia
said. ``You can't go out there and pass up a good decision to get
somebody the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   Garcia said he was aware that Stokes went without a catch in the
last game, and he said he'd try to keep everybody involved.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile Stokes wonders if the team can become more like the
division-leading Rams, who are constantly feeding their three top
receivers with pass after pass.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know how in the hell they do it,'' Stokes said.

KRAYZELBURG WINS GOLD MEDAL IN 200-METER BACKSTROKE

<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia _ Lenny Krayzelburg's body was tightening up
and the pain was gripping him. He was still leading the 200-meter
backstroke, but his only goal in the last half of the race Thursday
was to fend off his American teammate, Aaron Peirsol, and Matthew
Welsh of Australia.
</P>
<P>
   The pain, he said, made him feel as if he had lost control of
his arms. They were stroking behind him, but he could not sense
what they were doing. His stroke rate in the 200 meters is slower
than his pace in the 100 meters, but he was stroking faster than he
preferred.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was overswimming, and it was catching up to me,'' he said
later.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever his struggles, Krayzelburg increased his lead over his
pursuers in each 50-meter segment of the race to take his second
gold medal of the Summer Games, in an Olympic record 1 minute 56.76
seconds. It added to the one he left the Sydney International
Aquatic Center with after winning the 100-meter backstroke on
Monday. Peirsol won the silver in 1:57.35.
</P>
<P>
   Welsh, who won the bronze Thursday and the silver in the 100,
said, ``To get that close to him is incredible.''
</P>
<P>
   When it was over, Krayzelburg's legs were wobbly. He lay on a
mat for five minutes, not enough time to end the pain, but he was
led to the medal ceremony. As it ended, he tripped on a bench as he
reached his parents in the stands, who each kissed him.
</P>
<P>
   And so, Lenny Krayzelburg's immigrant tale got a little bit
better.
</P>
<P>
   His story is by now a familiar one. Krayzelburg was born in
Odessa, in Ukraine, when it was a republic in the Soviet Union, one
week short of 25 years ago. He swam 12 hours a day at a Soviet
sports school with 44 other young swimmers, and emigrated in 1989
with his parents and sister to West Hollywood, Calif. He knew no
English, and at first, he had no pool to swim in.
</P>
<P>
   He later found one in a Jewish community center that was just 25
yards long, then a longer one at Santa Monica College that required
a lengthy bus trip.
</P>
<P>
   And eventually, he fulfilled the faith of a former coach who saw
greatness for him in the backstroke, and set world records in the
50-, 100- and 200-meter races.
</P>
<P>
   Now, two gold medals may be as good as finding that the streets
were paved with gold.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, growing up, the Olympics were always a big thing,
and in the last few years, when I watched the Olympics, I'd get
emotional watching the stories of sacrifice,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But when he swims, he said, he tries to eliminate emotion. ``I
expect myself to win, and although I've had challenges and
obstacles coming here, I've always thought, `This is the situation
I'm in and I'll give 100 percent effort.' You make the best out of
it.'' Although he expressed himself impassively, he added: ``I
can't say much more. I definitely don't realize what I
accomplished.''
</P>
<P>
   His voice and passion elevated only when he discussed the impact
of team momentum, especially of Misty Hyman's 200-meter butterfly
victory on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was the most inspirational swim I've ever seen,'' he
said. ``I'm speechless about that swim. It lifted the girls in the
800-meter free relay. That's been the swim of the meet.''

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ George W. Bush was in California the other day,
doing his best to meet some of those ``real people'' he has defined
as the constituency he has to reach to win November's presidential
election.
</P>
<P>
   It was a trademark display of aw-shucks populism tinged with
bumbling uncertainty.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican candidate walked into an old-fashioned drug store
in Orange County, stepped behind the counter and began flipping
burgers. Not a bad touch.
</P>
<P>
   Then he had his photograph taken with the real chef, who looked
more bewildered than honored, shook hands with everyone including a
mannequin (hardly a ``real person,'' even if it raised a laugh),
and woefully undertipped for his vanilla milkshake, which turned
out to be chocolate because the waitress muffed his order.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately for Bush, Orange County is one of the most
conservative areas in the country, so nobody much minded the
clumsiness. But the episode encapsulated a deeper, uncomfortable
truth about his campaign: for all his raw charm, something just
isn't working.
</P>
<P>
   In California, the single most significant state with 54
presidential electoral votes at stake, it is working even less well
than in the rest of the country. He isn't winning the voters over
on the issues, and he is not impressing them with his personality.
</P>
<P>
   That explains why opinion polls are putting him at least 10
points behind his Democratic rival, Vice President Al Gore, and why
most political analysts have written off his chances of carrying
the state.
</P>
<P>
   And yet Bush keeps coming. He was in California for three days
last week, spoke to the state Republican convention by satellite
over the weekend and is due back at least twice more before
election day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I view California as a battleground state,'' he said, bravely,
in his satellite speech. ``In a race like this, everything we do
matters. Every day matters. And everyone in this room can make a
difference.'' (Another infelicity: he was not in the room himself.)
</P>
<P>
   In fact, a growing body of opinion suggests California is
turning into a big sinkhole for the Bush campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The state is too big for the candidate to ignore; apart from his
own election, he has five tightly fought congressional races to
worry about _ races that could make the difference between the
Republicans maintaining control of the House of Representatives and
losing it.
</P>
<P>
   And yet the more time he spends here, the less he can focus on
the real battleground states like Pennsylvania, Ohio, New Jersey
and Florida. It's a classic dilemma that has plagued all Republican
presidential candidates since Ronald Reagan, and one that is making
California Democrats inordinately happy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got him where we want him,'' crowed Bob Mulholland, a
state party spokesman. ``The Republicans are so terrified of
headlines saying `Bush Jr. Abandons California' that they are
spending $500 million a week on television ads and keep yanking
their candidate back here. That's the way we like it _ make 'em
spend two dollars for every dollar we spend, and still lose.''
</P>
<P>
   Some California Republicans, meanwhile, are voicing concerns
that Bush isn't helping them enough. An aide to the struggling
Republican senatorial candidate Tom Campbell complained last week
that Bush's television advertisements should be more aggressive.
</P>
<P>
   And Ron Unz, the software entrepreneur turned Republican
activist, said Bush would have to ``put a lot more time and effort
into the state if he wants to have a shot.''
</P>
<P>
   One particularly fraught battleground is San Jose, in the heart
of Silicon Valley. The Republicans took a gamble here by
withdrawing the popular, widely respected Campbell from his House
seat so they would have a decent candidate to put up against the
formidable Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein.
</P>
<P>
   As things stand, however, Campbell looks likely to lose to
Feinstein anyway, while his replacement in San Jose, Jim Cunneen,
is trailing his Democratic counterpart, Mike Honda.
</P>
<P>
   Furious struggles are underway in three other Republican
controlled districts: Glendale, in the northern Los Angeles
suburbs, where one of the House managers who impeached President
Bill Clinton, Jim Rogan, is under threat; Torrance, where a popular
former Democratic congresswoman, Jane Harmon, is coming back to
reclaim her seat following an unsuccessful bid for state governor;
and San Diego. The fifth close race is over a Democrat-controlled
seat in the arid agricultural city of Fresno.
</P>
<P>
   Since the Republican majority in the House is just 12 seats, a
clean sweep for the Democrats in California _ which is beginning to
look distinctly possible _ would be almost enough on its own to
shift the balance of power on Capitol Hill.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's presence in California is not entirely a lost cause. If
nothing else, he can use his fund-raising prowess to help
congressional candidates replenish their war chests _ a crucial
factor in a state with the highest television advertising rates in
the nation.
</P>
<P>
   The way things are going, however, it seems there will be
nowhere near enough of Bush to spread around, no matter how many
mannequins he shakes hands with between now and Nov. 7. &QL;

   LOS ANGELES _ George W. Bush was in California the other day,
doing his best to meet some of those ``real people'' he has defined
as the constituency he has to reach to win November's presidential
election.
</P>
<P>
   It was a trademark display of aw-shucks populism tinged with
bumbling uncertainty.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican candidate walked into an old-fashioned drug store
in Orange County, stepped behind the counter and began flipping
burgers. Not a bad touch.
</P>
<P>
   Then he had his photograph taken with the real chef, who looked
more bewildered than honored, shook hands with everyone including a
mannequin (hardly a ``real person,'' even if it raised a laugh),
and woefully undertipped for his vanilla milkshake, which turned
out to be chocolate because the waitress muffed his order.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately for Bush, Orange County is one of the most
conservative areas in the country, so nobody much minded the
clumsiness. But the episode encapsulated a deeper, uncomfortable
truth about his campaign: for all his raw charm, something just
isn't working.
</P>
<P>
   In California, the single most significant state with 54
presidential electoral votes at stake, it is working even less well
than in the rest of the country. He isn't winning the voters over
on the issues, and he is not impressing them with his personality.
</P>
<P>
   That explains why opinion polls are putting him at least 10
points behind his Democratic rival, Vice President Al Gore, and why
most political analysts have written off his chances of carrying
the state.
</P>
<P>
   And yet Bush keeps coming. He was in California for three days
last week, spoke to the state Republican convention by satellite
over the weekend and is due back at least twice more before
election day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I view California as a battleground state,'' he said, bravely,
in his satellite speech. ``In a race like this, everything we do
matters. Every day matters. And everyone in this room can make a
difference.'' (Another infelicity: he was not in the room himself.)
</P>
<P>
   In fact, a growing body of opinion suggests California is
turning into a big sinkhole for the Bush campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The state is too big for the candidate to ignore; apart from his
own election, he has five tightly fought congressional races to
worry about _ races that could make the difference between the
Republicans maintaining control of the House of Representatives and
losing it.
</P>
<P>
   And yet the more time he spends here, the less he can focus on
the real battleground states like Pennsylvania, Ohio, New Jersey
and Florida. It's a classic dilemma that has plagued all Republican
presidential candidates since Ronald Reagan, and one that is making
California Democrats inordinately happy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got him where we want him,'' crowed Bob Mulholland, a
state party spokesman. ``The Republicans are so terrified of
headlines saying `Bush Jr. Abandons California' that they are
spending $500 million a week on television ads and keep yanking
their candidate back here. That's the way we like it _ make 'em
spend two dollars for every dollar we spend, and still lose.''
</P>
<P>
   Some California Republicans, meanwhile, are voicing concerns
that Bush isn't helping them enough. An aide to the struggling
Republican senatorial candidate Tom Campbell complained last week
that Bush's television advertisements should be more aggressive.
</P>
<P>
   And Ron Unz, the software entrepreneur turned Republican
activist, said Bush would have to ``put a lot more time and effort
into the state if he wants to have a shot.''
</P>
<P>
   One particularly fraught battleground is San Jose, in the heart
of Silicon Valley. The Republicans took a gamble here by
withdrawing the popular, widely respected Campbell from his House
seat so they would have a decent candidate to put up against the
formidable Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein.
</P>
<P>
   As things stand, however, Campbell looks likely to lose to
Feinstein anyway, while his replacement in San Jose, Jim Cunneen,
is trailing his Democratic counterpart, Mike Honda.
</P>
<P>
   Furious struggles are underway in three other Republican
controlled districts: Glendale, in the northern Los Angeles
suburbs, where one of the House managers who impeached President
Bill Clinton, Jim Rogan, is under threat; Torrance, where a popular
former Democratic congresswoman, Jane Harmon, is coming back to

and San Diego. The fifth close race is over a Democrat-controlled

nothing else, he can use his fund-raising prowess to help
congressional candidates replenish their war chests _ a crucial
factor in a state with the highest television advertising rates in
the nation.
</P>
<P>
   The way things are going, however, it seems there will be
nowhere near enough of Bush to spread around, no matter how many
mannequins he shakes hands with between now and Nov. 7. &QL;

 By MARY DEJEVSKY  
 c.2000 The Independent, London  
<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Striving to make up the ground he has recently lost
to Vice President Al Gore, George W. Bush set off Monday on a
six-day, nine-state, 12-city tour designed to give the lie to three
persistent criticisms of his campaign: that he is weak on issues,
insufficiently focused on women voters and taking too leisurely an
approach to campaigning.
</P>
<P>
   His route, from Arkansas through Illinois and Pennsylvania to
Florida, takes him through a succession of ``battleground'' states
that were until recently seen as his to lose but now seem to be
inclining towards Gore.
</P>
<P>
   This week, unusually, Bush will also be campaigning on Saturday;
he usually takes the whole weekend off.
</P>
<P>
   Upping the pace, however, is the least of the adjustments he is
making in his quest for the White House. The most telling is his
decision, trumpeted in advance by his advisers, to challenge Gore
for the ``middle-class'' vote.
</P>
<P>
   The theme of this week is a ``Blueprint for the Middle Class,''
addressing such concerns as health-care costs, pensions, income tax
and the family.
</P>
<P>
   ``Middle class'' as defined in the supposedly classless United
States, is not at all the same as the term is understood in Europe.
It is significantly further down the status and income scale,
taking in the more junior teachers, nurses, but also small
businesspeople and groups that in Europe would be regarded as
``blue-collar.''
</P>
<P>
   In the U.S., middle class means middle income, with household
income of between $30-60,000, and while this allows for an
acceptable standard of living, it leaves little to spare.
</P>
<P>
   When Gore shifted his campaign sharply _ and unexpectedly _
leftward at the Democratic Party convention last month, it was
partly in recognition that at least some of the ``middle-class''
votes could be his for the asking.
</P>
<P>
   While people with middle incomes are traditionally as likely to
vote Republican as Democrat _ because they associate government
with inefficiency and handouts to those less deserving than
themselves _ there is a chance this year that they could find more
to please them in Gore's program than in Bush's.
</P>

   WASHINGTON _ Striving to make up the ground he has recently lost
to Vice President Al Gore, George W. Bush set off Monday on a
six-day, nine-state, 12-city tour designed to give the lie to three
persistent criticisms of his campaign: that he is weak on issues,
insufficiently focused on women voters and taking too leisurely an
approach to campaigning.
</P>
<P>
   His route, from Arkansas through Illinois and Pennsylvania to
Florida, takes him through a succession of ``battleground'' states
that were until recently seen as his to lose but now seem to be
inclining towards Gore.
</P>
<P>
   This week, unusually, Bush will also be campaigning on Saturday;
he usually takes the whole weekend off.
</P>
<P>
   Upping the pace, however, is the least of the adjustments he is
making in his quest for the White House. The most telling is his
decision, trumpeted in advance by his advisers, to challenge Gore
for the ``middle-class'' vote.
</P>
<P>
   The theme of this week is a ``Blueprint for the Middle Class,''
addressing such concerns as health-care costs, pensions, income tax
and the family.
</P>
<P>
   ``Middle class'' as defined in the supposedly classless United
States, is not at all the same as the term is understood in Europe.
It is significantly further down the status and income scale,
taking in the more junior teachers, nurses, but also small
businesspeople and groups that in Europe would be regarded as
``blue-collar.''
</P>
<P>
   In the U.S., middle class means middle income, with household
income of between $30-60,000, and while this allows for an
acceptable standard of living, it leaves little to spare.
</P>
<P>
   When Gore shifted his campaign sharply _ and unexpectedly _
leftward at the Democratic Party convention last month, it was
partly in recognition that at least some of the ``middle-class''
votes could be his for the asking.
</P>
<P>
   While people with middle incomes are traditionally as likely to
vote Republican as Democrat _ because they associate government
with inefficiency and handouts to those less deserving than
themselves _ there is a chance this year that they could find more
to please them in Gore's program than in Bush's.
</P>
<P>
   The United States as a whole may be experiencing an
unprecedented economic boom, but the benefits have accrued far more
to those already comfortably off: those in the middle and lower
income groups have generally sustained their earning power, if at
all, by working more hours.
</P>
<P>
   If they have a stake in the stock market, it is not enough to
feel much better off than before. At the same time, they have seen

especially medicines _ increase, while health insurance benefits

<P>
   (UNDATED) _ This is a crucial week for the Balkans. Sunday's
elections in Belgrade could prove historic.
</P>
<P>
   The opinion polls are running strongly against Slobodan
Milosevic: they are giving his main challenger, Vojislav Kostunica,
around twice as much support as the Yugoslav president himself
enjoys.
</P>
<P>
   Theoretically, this could be the endgame. There are, however,
many ifs and buts.
</P>
<P>
   The chances of an opposition victory, followed by a peaceful
handover of power, are small. Partly, that is because support for
Kostunica is far from united, even now. The bitter quarrels that
have marked Serb opposition politics in recent years have created
an almost bottomless well of apathy among ordinary voters.
</P>
<P>
   Again and again, opposition leaders have held rallies at which
they triumphantly proclaim that Milosevic will be out within a few
days or weeks. And, of course, he never is.
</P>
<P>
   Kostunica was the latest in a long line, when he told crowds at
a weekend rally: ``Thanks to your great belief in change, we shall
win.''
</P>
<P>
   Many opposition supporters believe that even if a clear majority
does vote for Kostunica, that victory will not be reflected in the
official results. The possibilities of ballot-rigging are many, and
Milosevic has been happy to go down that road before.
</P>
<P>
   Accusations that Milosevic is ``preparing to steal the
elections'' are widespread among his critics.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, there is a curious implied agreement between government
and opposition about the expected official outcome on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The regime declares that Milosevic will defeat the opposition's
``hard-core separatists and terrorists''; the opposition, in turn,
says that Milosevic's ``bullies, liars and thieves'' will steal
votes in order to proclaim a fake victory.
</P>
<P>
   The real question, therefore, is not what happens on Sunday but
what comes after.
</P>
<P>
   In cities across eastern Europe in 1989, crowds defied guns and
tanks to get rid of unwanted dictators. It is still unclear whether
Serb crowds will show the same determination _ or whether the
inevitable protests after the vote will give way to mere
background-noise bellyaching.
</P>
<P>
   This is where the strength and unity of the opposition will play
a crucial role. The regime has, in recent weeks and months, clamped
down hard on the opposition, especially the student-led Otpor
(``Resistance''). Beatings-up and arrests are commonplace.
Supporters of the opposition must overcome both apathy and fear.
</P>
<P>
   If the lack of unity in the Serb opposition is partly
responsible for the failure to oust Milosevic, the West has done
its bit.
</P>
<P>
   With a few absurd exceptions _ like Asphalt for Democracy, where
the EU helps to repair roads in cities administered by opponents of
Milosevic _ there has been little attempt to persuade Serbs that
the argument is with the regime, not with ordinary Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   In Kosovo, innocent Serbs are in daily danger; the United
Nations does little to protect them.
</P>
<P>
   A Serb journalist, Miroslav Filipovic, has been jailed for seven
years for alleged espionage _ in reality, for telling the truth;
the West has kept almost silent, instead of defending a courageous
Serb.
</P>
<P>
   Yugoslavia today is highly unstable _ not least because, in the
event of a Milosevic victory, the little reformist republic of
Montenegro may yet secede.
</P>
<P>
   Serbs need to know that, if they press for democracy, Yugoslavia
can receive the political and economic help that it desperately
needs. For the moment, there is too little sign of that. &QL;

   CLEVELAND _ Anyone who doubted Joe Lieberman's positive impact
on Vice President Al Gore's presidential campaign should have been
at Warrensville Heights High School near the city of Cleveland for
his latest rally.
</P>
<P>
   A Democratic stronghold in a crucial ``battleground'' state,
Warrensville offered Lieberman a safely sympathetic audience on
Wednesday evening at the end of a day in which he had notched up
air miles by the thousand in the latest of his cross-continent
campaign dashes.
</P>
<P>
   But if Al Gore's running mate arrived looking
uncharacteristically weary, one glance at the audience seemed to
revive him.
</P>
<P>
   Here, in a landscape of featureless government housing and
modest family homes, was an ethnic mix of urban Americans of the
sort that is almost never gathered together under one roof.
</P>
<P>
   Blacks, whites, Jews, Muslims, young and old, sat and stood side
by side to hear the man who aspires to be America's next vice
president.
</P>
<P>
   In terms of venue and numbers, this was just another rally in
just another stuffy school gymnasium, with just another uniformed
band and just another team of pompon-shaking cheerleaders.
</P>
<P>
   Who knew that the 3,000 people who had taken off from work early
that night made up one of the largest audiences ever gathered at
Warrensville Heights High for a political rally? And certainly the
most diverse?
</P>
<P>
   Well, the audience knew, for a start. Smartly turned out Marlene
Shettel, 70, could hardly remember the last, and only, time she had
attended a political rally. Racking her brains, she thought it was
probably as long ago as 1960, and a rally at a car factory for John
F. Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   Most car factories are long gone from northern Ohio, and Mrs.
Shettel _ who is Jewish _ is working in her retirement as an
accounting assistant at a real-estate office.
</P>
<P>
   She had asked her boss to leave work early, but had not told him
where she was going. ``I just wanted to see Joe Lieberman,'' she
said, explaining that she had seen ``this little announcement in
the paper'' and had dropped into a nearby bookstore to ask whether
the rally was really happening.
</P>
<P>
   When Gore nominated Joe Lieberman, the 59-year-old senator from
Connecticut, just before last month's Democratic convention, there
were plenty of people _ inside and outside politics _ who worried
that his Orthodox Judaism could prove an electoral liability.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Lieberman has made it, by sheer force of his
personality, into a distinct asset. Relaxed and entertaining on the
campaign trail, he presents his Jewishness as a non-denominational
devoutness that adherents of other faiths can only admire.
</P>
<P>
   The initial misgivings of some black politicians have been
largely dissipated, although echoes can still be detected. Fears
among Jews that Lieberman's new prominence might draw attention to
highly-placed Jews who might prefer to remain in obscurity have
also proved unfounded.
</P>
<P>
   And criticism (also from fellow Jews) that his frequent
references to his faith crossed the invisible line between religion
and politics quickly died down. Church and state may be
constitutionally separate, but American voters prefer politicians
of faith. The nature of that faith seems secondary.
</P>
<P>
   Blacks constituted around half of the Warrensville Heights
audience and a big majority of the school pupils.
</P>
<P>
   A local black churchman, Melvon Chase, said enthusiastically
that the Gore-Lieberman ticket was ``the best that America has to
offer.'' Lieberman's selection, he said, was one of the ``wisest
selections of a running mate'' and cast Al Gore in a new light,
too.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Al Gore is going to win, and I think it will be by 10
percent,'' he ventured.
</P>
<P>
   Most polls currently put Gore more than 4 points ahead, but
slightly behind in the marginal state of Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   Another first-timer at a political rally was David, a teacher at
a nearby Jewish school, who saw the choice of Lieberman as
``inspiring.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't excited by either of the candidates,'' he said. ``But
now I really am.'' Sweeping his arm around the hall, he added:
``Look at this mix here; it's really inspiring. You don't often
seen that in a forum...it's kind of healing.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a sentiment shared by Lieberman, who bounded onto the
platform in shirtsleeves, exclaiming ``Wow!'' as he mopped his brow
from the heat. ``It's a wonderful thing to see a crowd that
reflects the diversity of this district _ we ought to do this more
often.''
</P>
<P>
   Pointing out his 6-foot-4-inch son in his entourage, he
explained his un-Lieberman-like height by saying that ``he ate a
lot of kosher junk food in his youth.''
</P>
<P>
   Then he launched into a catalogue of the Gore election program,
from reducing the national debt to helping pensioners with their
prescription costs, from spreading the benefits of the economic
boom more widely to increasing teachers' pay, before concluding
with a plea for votes.
</P>
<P>
   ``With Al Gore, we've got a bit of a head of steam going here,''
he said, alluding to their lead in the national polls. ``And we've
come a long way in Ohio; our opponents never thought it would be
this close.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Gore-Lieberman carries Ohio, that's it, folks,'' he
quipped, adding drily: ``I don't want to put too much pressure on
you, but the future of America is on your shoulders.''
</P>
<P>
   At which, he left the microphone, blew kisses to the band, and
descended into the crowd for an orgy of handshaking before
departing.
</P>
<P>
   His new fans would happily have listened for longer; they found
him just a little low-key. But no matter: his day had been longer
than their's, and they appreciated his effort.
</P>
<P>
   Some may even remember his visit long enough to make the effort
to turn out to vote in six weeks' time _ which is what, after all,
it was all about. &QL;

   STRASBOURG _ VojisIav Kostunica is fighting an uphill battle to
oust President Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia. He would almost
certainly win a free and fair ballot, even if Milosevic still
enjoys considerable support. But Sunday's elections will be neither
free nor fair. That much is already clear.
</P>
<P>
   The electoral laws are seriously flawed and have been designed
to facilitate fraud. There will be no proper international
observation.
</P>
<P>
   Two essential conditions for free and fair elections, freedom of
media and freedom of association, are simply not met.
</P>
<P>
   Last week the country's electoral commission ordered what is
left of the independent media to stop distributing what they
described as ``political propaganda for the opposition.'' The
latter is constantly harassed, its campaign rallies banned, its
grass-roots activists arrested and beaten.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic's immense propaganda machine is portraying his
political opponents as traitors and fascists. Ludicrous tales of
their alleged plots with the NATO aggressor are revealed daily, to
fuel the collective paranoia and prepare the terrain for future,
more radical measures against the opposition. If, against all odds,
it happens to win.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic will not be playing fair. He never did, at least not
voluntarily. We should not dupe ourselves into believing that he
could be coerced into conceding defeat as he had been after the
municipal elections in 1996. Not after Kosovo and his indictment
for war crimes. He has little to win and everything to lose from
accepting defeat.
</P>
<P>
   Or does he really?
</P>
<P>
   The law on presidential elections in Yugoslavia, freshly
produced for the purposes of these very elections, stipulates that
the president may leave his office before the expiration of the
term for which he was elected only in three precise cases: death,
dismissal or resignation. The election of his successor is not
included.
</P>
<P>
   Hence, even in the unlikely event of Kostunica's victory being
accepted by the regime, and provided that none of the three
situations envisaged by the law occurs _ which is a rather safe bet
_ Milosevic would stay firmly in the saddle until his original term
comes to the end, in July 2001. Long after the crucial Serbian
elections next spring. Plenty of time for all sorts of mischief.
</P>
<P>
   If Kostunica wins, in the first round of voting Sept. 24 or in a
second-round runoff Oct. 8, Milosevic could see out his term while
Belgrade demands that the international community put its money
where its mouth has been.
</P>
<P>
   Yugoslavia has been promised plenty in return for a free and
fair vote, and what better evidence of freedom and fairness can
there be than the triumph of an opposition candidate?
</P>
<P>
   This would present us with a considerable dilemma, to which I
personally have no answer.
</P>
<P>
   We could deliver: the lifting of sanctions, economic aid,
political dialogue, the whole lot. But with an indicted war
criminal still in office, who would be allowed to take credit for
it?
</P>
<P>
   We could refuse. In this case Belgrade, but also others, Moscow
included, would protest against what they would see as double
standards, hypocrisy and the breach of the word that had been
given.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic would be given an opportunity to portrait himself as a
democrat wronged, through which he could offset most of the risk
stemming from his electoral defeat.
</P>
<P>
   Kostunica himself would be in dire straits. He would be
president-elect, but this is a dubious honor in a country where
things may happen to you every day, politically or otherwise. And
nine months is a long time to wait, particularly for a post which,
if occupied by any other person than Milosevic, yields little
power.
</P>
<P>
   Kostunica could lean to the West. But in this, he would have
little to offer, even less to gain and much to lose. His campaign
ticket is, even if moderately, distinctively nationalist and
anti-NATO. Changing the course would be political suicide.
</P>
<P>
   He could, of course, lean the other way.
</P>
<P>
   All this is largely hypothetical. The most likely outcome is
still a fraudulent victory for Milosevic. It is not in his
character to lose. But he did cover all eventualities.
</P>
<P>
   When Tito died in 1980, the slogan ``There will be Tito after
Tito'' was created to comfort the bereaved population. What was a
propagandist platitude 20 years ago may become a harsh political
reality today: Regardless of the outcome of the forthcoming ballot,
there will be Milosevic after Milosevic.  &LR;  &QL;

   SYDNEY, Australia _ Lisa Fernandez bounced and bounced on the
back of the mound Thursday afternoon, jogging in place, shaking her
energy into proper alignment. She always does this, but her
jangling seemed especially ferocious now. She had a losing streak
to stop, a four-year-old nightmare to erase.
</P>
<P>
   The American softball team, favored to defend its 1996 title,
had dropped two straight games in the Olympic tournament. Now the
United States was facing the Australians, the team that had haunted
Fernandez since a 10th-inning home run in Atlanta beat her and
ended a perfect game.
</P>
<P>
   So Fernandez jogged and jogged and jogged. She ran about 20
miles Thursday. It still wasn't enough to escape the hex.
</P>
<P>
   Holding a 1-0 lead with two outs in the bottom of the 13th
inning, Fernandez threw a drop pitch _ ``supposedly a drop ball,''
she said later _ to Peta Edebone. The ball came off Edebone's bat
so hard that Fernandez knew immediately. By the time Edebone's hit
cleared the fence, the American pitcher was already walking across
the first-base line to the dugout.
</P>
<P>
   Because a runner is placed on second base in any softball game
with the temerity to last 10 innings, Edebone's home run was a
two-run shot, giving the Australians a 2-1 victory and the
Americans their third loss in a row.
</P>
<P>
   Fernandez struck out 25 batters, and it did her no good. The
bottom five hitters in the Australian lineup put the ball into play
just three times in 13 innings, and it did them no harm.
</P>
<P>
   Aussie pitcher Tanya Harding, a former UCLA player with no
relationship to the infamous figure skater, struck out 18. And
Edebone, the cleanup hitter, did her job. As she rounded third
base, Edebone saw her teammates massed at home plate, crying, ready
to mob her. ``I just burst into tears,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   With two games left, the United States is still alive in the
round-robin format. The team needs to finish in the top four out of
eight teams to advance to the medal round, where the slate goes
clean.
</P>
<P>
   But will the United States be able to recover? At the moment,
they look completely deflated. In international and exhibition
competition, they had won 112 straight games before this current,
unfathomable losing streak.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like there's a voodoo on us right now,'' left fielder
Christie Ambrosie said. ``But it's got to change.''
</P>
<P>
   The Americans have played a total of 38 innings in the
three-game losing streak. They had less than 13 hours between their
loss to China on Wednesday night and the start of the Australia
game. They had played so late against the Chinese that an overnight
sprinkler kicked into action in the 13th inning. It needed to be
shut down, in the same manner as the U.S. team.
</P>
<P>
   The Americans had five hits Thursday, after collecting only
three Wednesday. Fernandez, normally a strong hitter, is in an
0-for-18 slump.
</P>
<P>
   But it is her pitching that matters most to the American team.
She is a hyperactive master on the mound, the author of five
straight perfect games in an exhibition tour this summer. Fernandez
is so driven that the 1996 loss to Australia nagged at her even
though the Americans went on to win the gold.
</P>
<P>
   Joanne Brown, who hit the home run in that 1996 game, batted
third Thursday. She went 0-for-4 with a walk and a strikeout.
</P>
<P>
   After the Atlanta Games, someone mailed a picture of Brown
celebrating the Olympic homer to Fernandez. The postmark was
Australian. A message on the back read ``See you in Japan.'' (That
was the site of the 1998 World Championships, which the Americans
won.)
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Brown came up just before Edebone and grounded out.
It was time for another Aussie to torture the perfectionist
pitcher.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went into the locker room, and I'm thinking: It can't happen
twice, can it?'' Fernandez said. ``But it did.''

   Only a week ago British ministers and newspaper pundits were
congratulating themselves that blockades and strikes were not the
British way. The fuel shortages in France, provoked by angry
truckers and fishermen, were complacently dismissed as typical
French excess. Just a week later, though, Britain was in the grip
of its very own crisis. Smugness about the maturity of the British
people and their political system was, in retrospect, rather
forgetful. &QL;

   Financial markets are no respecters of history. Just ask J.P.
Morgan, the bank that came to dominate finance in America by the
end of the 19th century. Before the creation of the Federal Reserve
in 1913 it in effect ran the American monetary system. Then its
power waned. In 1990 it was, by market capitalization, America's
biggest bank; last year it did not even make the top ten. And now
the ultimate humiliation: it was being taken over by another
American bank, Chase Manhattan. The deal speaks volumes about how
rapidly and profoundly the world's banking industry is changing. &QL;

   Israel under Ehud Barak keeps coming tantalizingly close to a
definitive peace with its immediate neighbors. The chance slipped
by with Syria and may now be lost with the Palestinians, because of
a couple of mosques and the site of a temple: Jerusalem. There is
more to it than that, of course, but not much more. Is there any
way for Jerusalem (West Jerusalem-plus) to become Israel's
internationally recognized capital, and al-Quds (a modified East
Jerusalem) to become Palestine's? &QL;

   The echoes from the 1970s and 1980s are becoming oppressive. Oil
crises, fuel shortages, street blockades and protests, currency
woes, paralyzed governments, excessive taxes. To many observers,
both within and beyond Europe, it must seem as if the old Continent
is once again locked in the grip of its old disease, eurosclerosis,
which first struck a quarter of a century ago, just after the 1973
oil shock. Was all the promise of Europe's single market, and its
new currency, just an illusion? The answer is no. And yet the past
few weeks have rightly shaken confidence in the new Europe. &QL;

been captured in a bottle, given a vigorous shake, and then
released in Room 216 of the Senate's Hart Building. There,
presiding over the Commerce Committee's hearings on the
entertainment industry's marketing violence to children, sat John
McCain, the man who in the Republican primaries turned George W.
Bush's coronation into a mud fight. And there, putting in a star
appearance, sat Joseph Lieberman, the man who galvanized Al Gore's
floundering campaign. By the end of the week Hollywood had joined

   BLOOMINGTON, INDIANA _ Indiana is basketball, root and soul _
and now it is angry. The sacking of Indiana University's head
basketball coach, Bob Knight, has been a little like evicting the
Pope from the Vatican. His three-decade pontificate has included
three national championships, 11 conference titles, an Olympic
victory and the fourth best all-time record in college basketball.
Whatever the effect on college sport, his passing will reverberate
throughout a state where almost every backyard has a basketball
hoop, towns shut down to watch school games, and the fondest dream
of every lanky teenager, until last week, was to play for Bobby
Knight at Indiana University. &QL;

   IOWA CITY, IOWA _ Measured by area, population, median income
and, not least, where it sits, Iowa is among the most middling of
states. But for better or worse, it has two things at which it
excels. One is agriculture; more than 85 percent of the state's
surface is still classified as farmland. The other is the age of
its people; Iowa already ranks fifth among the states in the
percentage of its people who are 65 or older. Many a strategy has
been proposed to reverse this greying tide, but perhaps the most
interesting _ and certainly the hottest _ is this one: encourage
more immigration. &QL;

   TRIPOLI _ The road to Tripoli airport testifies to Muammar
Qaddafi's shifting ideology. First come the signs for Arab unity,
rusting badly. Then, the slogans heralding Libya's ruler as the
head of the revolutionary Islam. Those too are beginning to rust.
Finally, on the approach to the airport, the signs for African
unity. ``We are so proud to be Africans,'' read the billboards. Few
of their leader's policies irritate Libyans more than his newly
adopted Africanization of Libya. Tripolitans curse the opening of
the borders which has turned them into a minority in their own
capital. &QL;

   Only a week ago British ministers and newspaper pundits were
congratulating themselves that blockades and strikes were not the
British way. The fuel shortages in France, provoked by angry
truckers and fishermen, were complacently dismissed as typical
French excess. Just a week later, though, Britain was in the grip
of its very own crisis. Smugness about the maturity of the British
people and their political system was, in retrospect, rather
forgetful. &QL;

   Financial markets are no respecters of history. Just ask J.P.
Morgan, the bank that came to dominate finance in America by the
end of the 19th century. Before the creation of the Federal Reserve
in 1913 it in effect ran the American monetary system. Then its
power waned. In 1990 it was, by market capitalization, America's
biggest bank; last year it did not even make the top ten. And now
the ultimate humiliation: it was being taken over by another
American bank, Chase Manhattan. The deal speaks volumes about how
rapidly and profoundly the world's banking industry is changing. &QL;

   Israel under Ehud Barak keeps coming tantalizingly close to a
definitive peace with its immediate neighbors. The chance slipped
by with Syria and may now be lost with the Palestinians, because of
a couple of mosques and the site of a temple: Jerusalem. There is
more to it than that, of course, but not much more. Is there any
way for Jerusalem (West Jerusalem-plus) to become Israel's
internationally recognized capital, and al-Quds (a modified East
Jerusalem) to become Palestine's? &QL;

   The echoes from the 1970s and 1980s are becoming oppressive. Oil
crises, fuel shortages, street blockades and protests, currency
woes, paralyzed governments, excessive taxes. To many observers,
both within and beyond Europe, it must seem as if the old Continent
is once again locked in the grip of its old disease, eurosclerosis,
which first struck a quarter of a century ago, just after the 1973
oil shock. Was all the promise of Europe's single market, and its
new currency, just an illusion? The answer is no. And yet the past
few weeks have rightly shaken confidence in the new Europe. &QL;

   For a few exhilarating hours last Wednesday morning it seemed as
if all the electricity of this year's presidential campaign had
been captured in a bottle, given a vigorous shake, and then
released in Room 216 of the Senate's Hart Building. There,
presiding over the Commerce Committee's hearings on the
entertainment industry's marketing violence to children, sat John
McCain, the man who in the Republican primaries turned George W.
Bush's coronation into a mud fight. And there, putting in a star
appearance, sat Joseph Lieberman, the man who galvanized Al Gore's
floundering campaign. By the end of the week Hollywood had joined
HMOs and drug firms on Gore's hate list. &QL;

   BLOOMINGTON, INDIANA _ Indiana is basketball, root and soul _
and now it is angry. The sacking of Indiana University's head
basketball coach, Bob Knight, has been a little like evicting the
Pope from the Vatican. His three-decade pontificate has included
three national championships, 11 conference titles, an Olympic
victory and the fourth best all-time record in college basketball.
Whatever the effect on college sport, his passing will reverberate
throughout a state where almost every backyard has a basketball
hoop, towns shut down to watch school games, and the fondest dream
of every lanky teenager, until last week, was to play for Bobby
Knight at Indiana University. &QL;

   IOWA CITY, IOWA _ Measured by area, population, median income
and, not least, where it sits, Iowa is among the most middling of
states. But for better or worse, it has two things at which it
excels. One is agriculture; more than 85 percent of the state's
surface is still classified as farmland. The other is the age of
its people; Iowa already ranks fifth among the states in the
percentage of its people who are 65 or older. Many a strategy has
been proposed to reverse this greying tide, but perhaps the most
interesting _ and certainly the hottest _ is this one: encourage
more immigration. &QL;

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia _ Jenny Thompson was last out of the pool
after Thursday night's 100-meter freestyle. This was her final
individual event in her third Olympic Games. Soon she will retire
at 27 and enter medical school at Columbia University. She checked
the giant television screen and the scoreboard to see her name in
third place, tied with her teammate Dara Torres in 54.43 seconds,
behind another gold-medal effort by Inge de Bruijn. Thompson swam
slowly toward the edge of the pool, as if she did not want to
leave.
</P>
<P>
   It was a somber moment, filled with condolence instead of
elation. Her career was ending, unsurpassed but oddly unrequited.
</P>
<P>
   No female American athlete has ever won seven gold medals in the
Olympics, as Thompson has. But all of her victories have come in
relays, including two here. None of the golds has come in
individual races, the mark of swimming greatness. The United States
won eight medals Thursday night, including a victory in the
200-meter backstroke in 1 minute, 56.76 seconds by Lenny
Krayzelburg, who took the 100-meter backstroke Tuesday. All the
same, Thursday night was an evening tinged with consolation.
</P>
<P>
   It was evident on Thompson's stoic face as she lost again to de
Bruijn of the Netherlands. It was evident in the sober way she
stood on the medal podium next to Torres. At 33, Torres is the only
U.S. swimmer ever to compete in four Olympics. Returning to the
sport after a seven-year layoff, she was ecstatic about her bronze
medal, matching the one she won in the 100 butterfly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they were in two different places on the medal
stand,'' said Richard Quick, the coach of the U.S. team and the
personal coach of both Thompson and Torres. ``Dara was celebrating
the fact that she won her second individual medal. Jenny had just
swum her last individual race. There was a goal she set that she
didn't accomplish. Maybe she was a little subdued as a result of
that.''
</P>
<P>
   At the 1996 Atlanta Olympics, Thompson did not qualify for any
individual events. Thursday night, just as she had done at the 1992
Barcelona Games, she failed to swim her best race. The winner, de
Bruijn, did not match her own world record of 53.77 seconds, set a
day earlier, but she won by half a second in 53.83 over Therese
Alshammar of Sweden.
</P>
<P>
   Once a talented but indifferent swimmer who was kicked off the
Dutch team for her listless training, de Bruijn has now won the
100-meter butterfly and the 100-meter freestyle at the Sydney
Games, and will be favored in Saturday's 50-meter freestyle. She
holds the world record in all three events. She has been able to do
what Thompson has not _ deliver her most assertive performances in
the most crucial races.
</P>
<P>
   ``At a critical time, she came through with a critical
performance,'' Quick said of de Bruijn. ``I take my hat off to
her.'' He added: ``There is a state of mind that great athletes can
get into that the rest of us don't understand. They relish the
pressure of the critical moment.''
</P>
<P>
   Even if she had matched her personal best of 54.07, however,
Thompson would have finished far behind de Bruijn Thursday night.
The dominance of the Dutch woman's performances has inevitably
raised questions about their legitimacy. Susie O'Neill, the
Australian Olympic champion, called de Bruijn's flurry of records
``pretty suss,'' or suspect, earlier this year, then apologized.
</P>
<P>
   Drug testing in Olympic sports is so deficient that there is no
certain way to tell whether athletes are using illicit substances
to enhance their performances. No tests exist, for instance, for
such drugs as human growth hormone and artificial blood. Every
remarkable performance in sports such as swimming and track and
field brings immediate suspicion.
</P>
<P>
   Women's swimming has become the most tarnished of the Olympic
sports amid revelations about systematic East German cheating in
the '70s and '80s, Chinese drug use in the '90s, positive tests by
Americans, and the 1998 banning of the Irish swimmer Michelle Smith
de Bruin from international competition for four years. De Bruin,
who won three gold medals at the Atlanta Games, was found to have
spiked a urine test with alcohol in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The sad thing, said Ad Roskam, team manager for the Dutch
swimmers, is that innocent athletes cannot prove their innocence.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't matter what you do _ you can have your whole body
tested _ but everyone is talking about drugs,'' said Jacco
Verhaeren, de Bruijn's boyfriend and one of her coaches, who said
the state of the sport made him livid.
</P>
<P>
   De Bruijn, who is 27, has vehemently denied using
performance-enhancing drugs. Her supporters point out that she has
been an Olympic-level competitor since 1992. After she did not
compete in the Atlanta Games because she lacked motivation for
training, she moved to Portland, Ore., in 1998 to work with Paul
Bergen, a respected coach who worked previously with the Olympic
champion Tracy Caulkins.
</P>
<P>
   Hard work, not banned substances, has made her into a champion
swimmer, de Bruijn said. In the pool, she said she trained with a
weight belt, and even wore shoes, to increase resistance in the
water. Her dry-land training includes power-lifting, running and
rope climbing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't really bother me anymore,'' de Bruijn said of the
skepticism about her performances. ``I know I have worked hard. It
comes down to jealousy if people still think that.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Quick said on Wednesday that he presumed that de Bruijn did not
use performance-enhancing drugs. The subject of drugs is a gnawing
one for Thompson, who with Quick accused the Chinese of cheating
after Zhuang Yong defeated her in the 100-meter freestyle at the
1992 Barcelona Games. At least three dozen Chinese swimmers have
since tested positive for drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do think it's a sad state of events when everyone who does
really well gets questioned,'' Thompson said Thursday night. ``At
the same time, it's sad there is a reason to question. I think
there is cheating in this sport. I'm not going to say I think Inge
is cheating. But I do think it's good to question things like
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Without naming names, Quick on Wednesday night deplored the
quality and frequency of drug testing and said he did not believe
this Olympic swimming competition had been drug free. He lamented
that the sport had a ``cloud over it.'' Thursday night the Dutch
took issue with his remarks and responded with bitter
recrimination.
</P>
<P>
   Quick is ``the most stupid idiot I ever saw,'' said Dr.
Cees-Rein van den Hoogenband, the father of the two-time Olympic
champion Pieter van den Hoogenband and an expert in trauma and
sports medicine. He said the Americans were bringing up the issue
of drugs out of jealousy because ``they can't win.''
</P>
<P>
   Quick responded that he was not pointing fingers at van den
Hoogenband and said of the swimmer's father, ``He's entitled to his
opinion.''
</P>
<P>
   One race remains for Thompson, Saturday's 400-meter individual
medley relay, in which she may add an eighth gold to her total,
along with the individual silver and bronze in her overall tally.
Even in her disappointment Thursday night, she seemed to come to
terms with her career, saying she was happy because she had given
her best effort.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's time for me to stop looking at what I don't have and
start looking at what I do have,'' Thompson said. ``I have more
medals than any American woman in any sport. I'm really proud of
what I've done. I have something to hang my hat on.''

CAMERA LOVES CRUZ IN ``WOMAN ON TOP''
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 By ROBERT PHILPOT 
 c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A character in ``Woman on Top'' blithely remarks that the camera
loves Isabella, the TV chef played by Spanish actress Penelope Cruz
in her first starring English-speaking role. This is an
understatement when it comes to Cruz and director Fina Torres'
camera, which doesn't just love her _ it wants to marry her, have
her children, grow old with her and weep inconsolably at her
funeral.
</P>
<P>
   Cameras can't do such things, of course, but they would if
Torres could figure out a way. The actions would fit in perfectly
with the magic-realism-lite tone of her movie, in which the aroma
of brewing coffee visually beckons men and a drop of a woman's
sweat can make a flower bloom. These dips into fantasy buoy the
far-fetched plot, making for an inconsequential but enjoyable
little folk tale.
</P>
<P>
   The movie begins in Bahia, on Brazil's northeastern coast, where
Cruz's Isabella marries handsome Toninho (Murilo Benicio) and
employs her talent for spicy dishes in his restaurant. Everything
would be great, except for her lifelong battle with motion
sickness, which is so powerful that she can't even ride an
elevator. The vertigo dissipates only when Isabella is in control,
whether it be behind the wheel or in the sack. This doesn't set
well with Toninho, whose sense of machismo is so wounded that he
creeps into a neighbor woman's bed, even though his wife is
apparently the hottest woman on Earth.
</P>
<P>
   Isabella catches him in the act, and is so upset that she jets
off to San Francisco, where she reunites with her best friend, a
transvestite named Monica (Harold Perrineau Jr. of TV's ``Oz''),
and they engage in some girlfriendly commiserating. Back in Brazil,
Isabella's departure _ and Toninho's reaction _ has so offended a
sea goddess that the fish supply dries up, threatening Toninho's
restaurant. But in San Fran, Isabella still has what it takes _ the
smell of her coffee hypnotizes scores of men, including a TV
producer (''Rules of Engagement's'' Mark Feuerstein) who scores her
a local cooking-show gig. Suddenly, Isabella's dishes are
mesmerizing everyone in the Golden Gate City _ and Toninho is on
the hunt for her, trying to win her back.
</P>
<P>
   Isabella specializes in peppery concoctions, so maybe a souffle
isn't the right food metaphor for this movie _ but it's so
lightweight, that's the word that comes to mind. Cruz makes it sexy
without half trying; she appears tentative, but it doesn't really
matter, because Torres and cinematographer Thierry Arbogast (''The
Fifth Element'') frame every shot of her so lovingly that all she
has to do is look good. Perrineau is an amusing scene-stealing
foil, and Feuerstein _ the type of character actor whose face is
immediately more familiar than his name _ is appealingly earnest.
</P>
<P>
   What stands out from the movie, apart from Cruz's presence, is
the food, including chiles that should grab the attention of any
fire-breathing Texan. It joins a list of movies, such as
``Babette's Feast'' and ``Eat Drink Man Woman,'' that you shouldn't
see on an empty stomach. ``Woman on Top'' is tasty enough, but
it'll leave you hungry for more.

SPORTS OF THE TIMES: A DISPLAY OF UNCOMMON STRENGTH 
</HEADLINE>
   By HARVEY ARATON    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BLACKTOWN, Australia _ She strung together 25 strikeouts and 12
and two-thirds innings of raw dominance, but it wasn't until after
one fatal mistake, her nightmarish defeat, that Lisa Fernandez
staged her most impressive show of uncommon strength.
</P>
<P>
   She didn't try to hide, as if the world wasn't watching, or
didn't exist. She didn't pose, or pretend, that she wasn't in pain.
She walked into the news conference and talked about the home run
pitch one out from victory, that confounding drop ball ``that
didn't drop'' and wound up far over the left-field fence. And after
a few more questions, when the press aides tried to shoo her away,
her body language said, relax fellas, I can deal with this, and
did.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's almost like this is not real,'' Fernandez said. ``To be
able to put on a show at the Olympics and then it's gone, now it's
like I'm waiting for someone to pinch me, to wake me up.''
</P>
<P>
   She stood there, eyes moist under her visor, giving credit to
the Australians, accepting blame for the Americans, guaranteeing
that she wouldn't give up. The last time a home run like just like
this one happened, an Australian lightning bolt in the 10th inning
of the Atlanta Olympics, Fernandez got over it, and her U.S.
softball team recovered to win the gold medal in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   This is Australia, four years later, with the competition gap
narrowed and too many American hitters mired in a deep and
inglorious slump.
</P>
<P>
   Though Thursday's 2-1, 13-inning Australia victory that saw a
parade of 42 women go down on strikes was extreme, hitters in this
pitching-dominated sport often seem to be waving at air, at 60-plus
miles-per-hour from 60 feet, 6 inches away.
</P>
<P>
   Too close, some journalists, typically male, have been heard to
snort, at the softball venue in this Sydney suburb. Too much of an
unnatural advantage, a misleading sense of power, as if the dunk
shot in basketball is some astounding feat for a well-conditioned
athlete who stands 6 feet 6 inches. As if technology hasn't
contributed to the 140-mph men's tennis serve and those soaring
drives off the golf tee. As if the idea of a woman like Lisa
Fernandez doing with a softball what the macho mound men like Roger
Clemens do with a baseball is a bit too much to take.
</P>
<P>
   ``The image of women and how they are portrayed is changing,''
Fernandez had said earlier, before Petra Edebone's blast sent the
Americans to their third straight defeat, leaving them no margin of
error to make the medal round. ``A lot of people are looking at
women athletes now, looking and photographing us as muscular and
strong. But how the poses are done _ that's a different question.''
</P>
<P>
   How the American swimmer, Jenny Thompson, appeared in Sports
Illustrated _bare from the waist up with her hands covering her
breasts _ created something of an uproar in the pre-Olympics rush.
Critics hit Thompson and the magazine for engaging in soft porn.
Defenders suggested the critics chill, that Thompson was hiding
what was nobody's business while celebrating her muscles in less
intimate places.
</P>
<P>
   Which sounded somewhat sincere, until the magazine followed up
with the Swedish swimmer, Therese Alshammar, scantily clad, in
several seductive positions that made the Anna Kournikova spread of
several months ago look like a Heidi retrospective.
</P>
<P>
   The question, as raised by Fernandez, was this: If these kinds
of photos are only about portraying female athletes as strong and
fit, why do the models always seem to be imported from some frat
boy fantasy? When did Barbie become the prototypical tough gal?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one thing when you have a sprinter bending down, in the
starting position, which is the natural athletic pose,'' Fernandez
said. ``But when they are put in a unnatural position, when there
clearly is a sexual connotation, that's going too far, in my
opinion. That's not called for, in order to get the athletic
message across.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why I love what our game represents, what it offers to
all girls, whether they are fast or slow, tall or short, stocky or
thin. This sport integrates all athletes, and measures strength in
different ways. And because all of our games are televised after
none were in Atlanta, I've been saying that this would be a very
big Olympics for us.''
</P>
<P>
   And that is another reason why this daughter of a Cuban
immigrant was taking the re-enactment of the '96 walk-off home run
against Australia so hard.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no excuses and there are no excuses,'' said Fernandez,
who broke down and cried over her unexpected futility at the plate
earlier this week.
</P>
<P>
   She had been a tower of power from the No. 3 slot in the batting
order and a virtual monolith on the mound. A pitcher so dominating
that she could recall the last hit Petra Edebone reached her for, a
couple of years ago, ``a blooper into center.''
</P>
<P>
   She is only 29 and hoping to play in two more Olympics. She lost
20 pounds preparing for Sydney, for quickness and endurance, to be
more athletic and fit. The only pose people will remember from
Thursday is her walking off the mound, in numbing disbelief. The
Aussies did it to her again, but Lisa Fernandez, through the tears,
was facing up to her mistake, staying strong. &QL;

JONES AND FREEMAN PREPARE FOR RACES WITHOUT TOP CHALLENGERS 
</HEADLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER CLAREY    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia _ Marion Jones no longer needs to worry about
Inger Miller in the women's 100 meters, and barring an improbable
reversal of fortune and direction, Cathy Freeman no longer needs to
worry about Marie-Jose Perec in the women's 400-meter run.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the marquee races in these Olympics are no longer worth
marking in bold letters after Miller's withdrawal because of an
injury and Perec's hurried and mysterious departure from Sydney,
but there will be no shortage of fairer fights when track and field
competition begins on Friday in the Olympic stadium.
</P>
<P>
   It will be Haile Gebrsellassie of Ethiopia vs. Paul Tergat of
Kenya in the men's 10,000; Gabriela Szabo of Romania vs. Svetlana
Masterkova of Russia and Suzy Favor-Hamilton of the United States
in the women's 1,500; Angelo Taylor and Eric Thomas of the United
States vs. Llewellyn Herbert of South Africa in the men's 400-meter
hurdles; Jones vs. Heike Drechsler of Germany and several others in
the women's long jump; Stacy Dragila of the United States vs. Emma
George of Australia and Anzhela Balakhonova of Ukraine in the first
women's Olympic pole vault competition.
</P>
<P>
   The list goes on, but it could have been a bit longer and quite
a bit more interesting if Maurice Greene and Michael Johnson, the
sport's two most prominent men, had managed to qualify for the 200.
Greene, the Kansan who holds the world record in the 100 and
Johnson, the Texan who holds it in the 200 and 400, both pulled up
short of the finish line with minor injuries in the 200 final at
the U.S. Olympic trials in July.
</P>
<P>
   That meant each man will compete in only one individual race in
Sydney, which also means that Ato Boldon, the loquacious sprinter
from Trinidad and Tobago who trains and races rental cars with
Greene, is now the favorite in the 200.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ato hasn't been thanking me,'' Greene said. ``But I heard he
had a big smile on his face after our race in the trials. I believe
I would be the same. When you know that two of your toughest
competitors are not going to be there, it makes it that much
easier. But you still have to go in there and focus.''
</P>
<P>
   The same goes for Freeman, the Aborigine who is enormously
popular in Australia and has become the international symbol of
these Games since she lit the submerged cauldron during the opening
ceremony. She is now the heaviest of favorites in the 400, which
will be contested on Tuesday night: The first session to sell out
when track and field tickets became available here.
</P>
<P>
   Since losing to Perec at the 1996 Olympic Games, she has won 41
of 42 finals in the 400 and has the year's fastest time of 49.48
seconds.
</P>
<P>
   Perec's career best is more than a second faster: 48.25. But
since winning the 200 and 400 in Atlanta, she has struggled with
motivation and her health, and after missing nearly two seasons
because of the enervating effects of Epstein-Barr syndrome, she
returned to competition late last season. The 400 race she ran in
July in Nice in 50.32 seconds was her first in nearly four years,
and she has yet to run another, citing nagging injuries and
insufficient financial incentives from European meet promoters.
</P>
<P>
   Yet she and her German coach Wolfgang Maier, the husband and
former coach of 400-meter world record-holder Marita Koch, both
have expressed delight with her training times and preparation for
Sydney. Nonetheless, Perec's behavior upon arrival in Sydney did
not project calm and confidence. Instead of answering questions
from an understandably inquisitive Australian media (she was, after
all, Freeman's principal rival) or staying and training with the
rest of the French Olympic team, she dashed past reporters at the
airport and chose to stay at the Mercure Grand Apartment Hotel at
Darling Harbour with here American boyfriend, Anthuan Maybank, part
of the gold medal-winning 1600-meter relay team in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Perec claimed to have been harassed by an intruder in her hotel
on Wednesday morning.
</P>
<P>
   According to Perec's agent Annick Avierinos, Perec told her a
man posing as a deliveryman forced his way into her room and
threatened her. Late that evening, she boarded a flight with
Maybank for Singapore. But Peter Hook, a spokesman for the hotel,
said that Perec had not registered a complaint with hotel
management and that police and hotel officials had found no
evidence of an incident.
</P>
<P>
   In the Singapore airport Thursday, Maybank was involved in a
scuffle with a cameraman working for an Australian television
network. The cameraman was reportedly hospitalized, and Freeman and
Maybank were taken to a police station where they spent several
hours being questioned before being released. Though French Olympic
officials were not yet prepared to rule Perec out of the Games, the
first round of the women's 400 is on Friday evening in Sydney,
which would leave her little time to reverse course and return.
</P>
<P>
   Freeman was not available for comment, but in an interview
before the Games, she made it clear that she wanted Perec, whom she
has never beaten in a major race, in the 400 final.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want her to come back strong,'' Freeman said. ``She's the
only other competitor I've raced against who gets to me the way she
does. Not gets to me but excites me. That's the word. I just have a
lot of respect for her. To run against her and beat her is the sort
of challenge I'm looking for.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   With or without Perec, competing in this Olympic stadium could
prove even more challenging than usual. Though architecturally
striking, its open design is hardly ideal for track and field.
September and October are Sydney's windiest months, and wind can be
a major distraction and hindrance in precision field events like
the pole vault and the high jump.
</P>
<P>
   In February, during the Australian track and field
championships, sprinters in one 100-meter heat were running into a
strong headwind. Sprinters in the next heat, only a few minutes
later, ran with a strong tailwind. Some competitors said they felt
the wind shift markedly in the middle of their heats. The winds in
September are primarily westerly and southerly winds, which means
that headwinds are more likely for the sprinters.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the Olympics were held in a hurricane, I'd still run,''
said Greene, who has the year's four fastest times in the 100 and
has predicted victory here.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first one to the finish line still gets the gold.''
</P>
<P>
   Cool temperatures could also be an issue. Although the weather
in Sydney during the first week of the games has been generally
warm and dry, the temperature range is traditionally wide here in
the spring and temperatures will drop in the evening, when the
majority of the finals will be contested.
</P>
<P>
   Yet it is difficult to imagine any conditions in which Jones
would not win the 100: The first event of her self-imposed
pentathlon in Sydney. She has not lost over that distance since
1997, and unlike Greene, the dominant force in the men's 100, she
has won this year even when she has started poorly. In her last two
outings, in Brussels and Berlin, she was particularly overwhelming.
</P>
<P>
   Even if Miller had not strained her hamstring and been forced to
withdraw from the 100, she would have had very little chance of
outrunning Jones, and Greece's Ekaterina Thanou, perhaps the next
best sprinter in the field, has very little chance, as well.
</P>
<P>
   Miller still hopes to be healthy enough to face Jones in the 200
and to compete with her in the 400-relay, another event that Jones
and the Americans are strong favorites to win.
</P>
<P>
   Other very likely winners include Gail Devers of the United
States in the 100 hurdles, Johnson in the men's 400, Hicham
Guerrouj of Morocco in the men's 1,500, Virgilijus Alekna of
Lithuania in the discus, Trine Hattestad of Norway in the women's
javelin, Mihaela Melinte of Romania in a new Olympic event, the
women's hammer; and Tomas Dvorak of the Czech Republic in the
decathlon, in which he will try to become the first man to amass
9,000 points in the 10 events.

 &HT;    DESPITE LAW, REFORMS LANGUISHED FOR YEARS
 &HT;    With NURSING-HOMES. For release Monday, Sept. 25.
 &HT;    By JULIA MALONE
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The road to nursing home improvement has been a
tortuous one of missed deadlines and unfinished agendas even as the
pace of new proposals accelerates.
</P>
<P>
   _ Enforcement of the Nursing Home Reform Act of 1987, set to
begin in 1990, was delayed until 1995 because the Health and Human
Services Department (HHS) was late in completing the necessary
regulations.
</P>
<P>
   _ By 1998, congressional investigators at the U.S. General
Accounting Office were probing California's nursing homes and
finding that 30 percent had health violations that caused injury or
death to residents, or had falsified records to hide deficiencies.
</P>
<P>
   Just a week before the scheduled release of the report,
President Clinton announced a crackdown on the worst nursing homes,
including surprise weekend inspections and immediate fines for
violating standards.
</P>
<P>
   _ In 1999, federal investigators continued to find major health
and safety violations. The HHS inspector general reported that
``some nursing homes are chronically substandard'' and that
complaints were on the rise.
</P>
<P>
   That year, Congress passed a law forbidding nursing homes from
evicting Medicaid recipients after some facilities began trying to
replace the residents with higher-paying clients.
</P>
<P>
   _ In 2000, Democratic congressional investigators began checking
conditions in a sampling of congressional districts and finding
serious health and safety problems.
</P>
<P>
   _ This summer, eight years late, HHS delivered a ground-breaking
report on the ill effects of understaffing in more than half of
America's nursing homes. The study had been ordered by Congress for
completion in 1992, but it was all but forgotten by lawmakers and
HHS until Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, chairman of the Senate
Aging Committee, brought it to the attention of the Clinton
administration.
</P>
<P>
   In response, President Clinton on Sept. 16 proposed $1 billion
in grants over the next five years to boost staffing in some
nursing homes. He also announced he was ordering the Health Care
Financing Administration to establish mandatory minimum standards
for staffing levels at nursing homes, but not for at least two more
years.

 &HT;    13 YEARS AFTER REFORM LAW, NEGLECT STILL HAUNTS NURSING HOMES
 &HT;    With NURSING-CHRONO. For release Monday, Sept. 25.
 &HT;    By JULIA MALONE
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ More than a decade of federal attempts, including a
sweeping federal law in 1987 and an enforcement crackdown by
President Clinton two years ago, have yet to deliver promised
quality care for nursing home residents.
</P>
<P>
   Prodded by a national Institute of Medicine report that
described ``shockingly'' poor conditions in many facilities in the
1980s, Congress enacted the Nursing Home Reform Act of 1987, which
was supposed to open a new era for long-term care. The law entitled
residents to individual care plans, sufficient services, and safe
surroundings.
</P>
<P>
   The 13 years since then have brought a chain of reports
concluding that federal enforcement of the law has been lax, and
many nursing homes grossly deficient.
</P>
<P>
   In one positive sign, health care experts say that the
facilities now use fewer unnecessary restraints to keep patients in
beds or chairs, and that they have reduced the practice of drugging
residents into a stupor to control behavior.
</P>
<P>
   But in a sizable number of nursing homes, government inspectors
and researchers continue to find residents who are malnourished,
left soaking in their own urine and feces, and physically abused by
underpaid, poorly trained staffers.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, nursing homes have not increased their staffing levels
as the number of residents has grown to 1.6 million. And the
facilities are serving sicker patients who are transferred sooner
from hospitals amid cost-cutting in the medical system.
</P>
<P>
   The state of nursing home standards is up for review Thursday at
a hearing of the Senate Special Committee on Aging, just as the
industry is receiving new critical reports.
</P>
<P>
   The Health and Human Services Department (HHS) recently
concluded that 54 percent of the nation's 17,000 long-term care
facilities are so understaffed that they harm their patients.
</P>
<P>
   That prompted Clinton to ask Congress this month to approve $1
billion in grants to boost chronic understaffing in nursing
facilities. Residents ``shouldn't go another day without the care
that they deserve,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Inspection results just compiled by the Health Care Financing
Administration (HCFA), which oversees most nursing homes, offer
further evidence of shoddy care.
</P>
<P>
   Among the findings from the first three months of this year:
</P>
<P>
   _ One out of every five facilities surveyed was cited for abuse
of residents, compared with one in 10 during the first quarter of
last year.
</P>
<P>
   _ Just over 17 percent were cited for failure to properly treat
or prevent bedsores, a condition that is frequently a sign of
neglect.
</P>
<P>
   _ Only about 15 percent of the facilities were found to be in
compliance with all health standards.
</P>
<P>
   When Democratic congressional investigators checked conditions
in a sampling of congressional districts this year, they also found
serious health and safety problems.
</P>
<P>
   The worst examples were in the San Francisco area, where worm
larvae were found crawling in one resident's bedsore. In another
home, ants were found crawling on the face of an 83-year-old woman.
In a third, the air conditioner had not worked for six months, and
residents' room temperatures ranged up to 90 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``The suffering of nursing home residents is intolerable,'' said
Sen. Charles E. Grassley, R-Iowa, who as chairman of the Senate
committee receives quarterly updates from HCFA on nursing homes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bedsores and malnutrition turn the stomach and hurt the
conscience,'' Grassley said recently. ``They beg for a solution,
the sooner, the better.''
</P>
<P>
   Why have the reforms mandated in 1987 failed to come about?
There are a number of viewpoints.
</P>
<P>
   The American Health Care Association, which represents about
11,000 for-profit nursing homes, blames the government for using
too much stick and not enough carrot.
</P>
<P>
   ``The answer is painfully obvious,'' said Michael Hogan, chief
lobbyist for the trade group. ``You can't punish your way to
quality improvement.''
</P>
<P>
   Brushing aside federal studies indicating that penalties have
been mild, Hogan complained that the government has spent years
building an ``enforcement machine'' for nursing home standards and
has not spent enough to improve care.
</P>
<P>
   Advocates for nursing home reforms, on the other hand, say the
government has used too much carrot and not enough stick.
</P>
<P>
   Toby Edelman, an attorney with the private Center for Medicare
Advocacy, points to total public funding for nursing homes, which
more than doubled from $25 billion in 1990 to an estimated $58
billion this year from the Medicaid and Medicare programs.
</P>
<P>
   Edelman cites numerous appeals and delays available to nursing
homes to avoid penalties and fines. She concluded that
``enforcement was pretty ineffectual, and any improvement was
really voluntary.''
</P>
<P>
   Like other nursing home critics, Edelman charged that nursing
home operators, who are big political campaign contributors, are
able to use their clout to fend off tough enforcement.

&HT;     POSTERS PUT DRIVERS, PEDESTRIANS ON ALERT 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By KATHLEEN SULLIVAN  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The poster shows a child sitting in a stroller,
his face turned toward a bright headlight. ``Yeah, you ran that
red, but you only killed one person,'' it says.
</P>
<P>
   In another poster, an elderly woman grasping a walker glances
over her shoulder at an approaching car, alarm in her deep-set
eyes. ``I'm sorry I ran over your grandma, but I didn't want to
spill my latte,'' it says.
</P>
<P>
   Those are among the startling images a San Francisco advertising
agency has produced to make people here think twice about rushing
across the street _ in a car or on foot.
</P>
<P>
   The posters, created by Goodby, Silverstein &AMP; Partners, will be
displayed in buses, bus shelters and on taxicabs in San Francisco
over the next several months.
</P>
<P>
   The posters all carry the same motto, printed in neon yellow:
``Slow It Down.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Goodby, co-chairman of Goodby Silverstein, said the
admonition was aimed at drivers and pedestrians.
</P>
<P>
   Often, people don't have a reason for speeding through an
intersection or dashing across a street, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The attitude is ``I don't know, I just have to get there,'''
Goodby said.
</P>
<P>
   The ads are part of the effort to reduce fatalities in San
Francisco's hurly-burly streets. So far this year, 23 pedestrians
have died. Last year, the death toll was 28.
</P>
<P>
   After the death toll drew citywide attention earlier this year,
Goodby offered to create, at no cost to the city, the pedestrian
safety advertisements.
</P>
<P>
   The ads are not just aimed at motorists. Investigators say
pedestrians are responsible for about half of the traffic accidents
that result in deaths in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   In one poster, a man in a white shirt dashes in between cars in
the middle of a busy street. ``Being on time is not as important if
you're dead,'' it says.
</P>
<P>
   Another reminds people why they should be careful: ``Steel is
stronger than flesh.''
</P>
<P>
   Ellen Vanderslice, president of America Walks, a national
coalition of pedestrian advocacy groups, said the black-and-white
images are compelling.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wow _ that's heavy,'' she said of the poster that says:
``Yeah, you ran that red, but you only killed one person.''
</P>
<P>
   Vanderslice said she liked the ``Slow It Down'' motto.
``Everybody needs to be paying attention and taking their time,''
she said.

`THUNDER FROM THE EAST': VIVID CONTRASTS IN MODERN ASIA 
</HEADLINE>
   (Editors: Publication notes appear at end of review.)  
 &HT;    Frank Gibney, author of ``The Pacific Century'' and other books,
is president of the Pacific Basin Institute and professor of
politics at Pomona College in California.
 By FRANK GIBNEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The blacktop road was sleek and new. Modern cars and trucks
whizzed past clean shops and restaurants, a far cry from the Java
countryside he had last visited 10 years before. All the more
shocking when this correspondent for The New York Times, on a trip
reporting the 1997 Asian economic crisis, found his way blocked by
a procession of young men on motorcycles cheered on by excited
villagers, proudly carrying the head of a newly murdered
``sorcerer'' on a pole. The sorcerers, the ninja, were the guilty
ones, he was told. Islamic vigilantes had killed them and more
would be killed to destroy their magic.
</P>
<P>
   This story begins the first chapter of a book written by two
Times correspondents, Nicholas D. Kristof and Sheryl WuDunn,
describing the turmoil in Asia at the century's end. (The
co-authors, who are a married couple, wrote alternate chapters.) I
can think of no better way to epitomize the contrasts between
modern, often dazzling economies and half-hidden ancient folkways
that continue to bubble up throughout the Asian countries.
Historical time-change may be the best way to describe the
differences between tradition and technology, new education and old
religion, emergent nationalisms and top-down globalization.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike geographical time-change, which is at least marked by
watch settings and disturbed circadian rhythms, historical
time-change is ever-present and unpredictable. It is the
inescapable byproduct of assorted Asian ``miracles'' in which
intellectual and economic pressures condensed within decades the
modernizations that Europeans and Americans took centuries to
achieve.
</P>
<P>
   In their book, challengingly subtitled ``Portrait of a Rising
Asia,'' WuDunn and Kristof have taken upon themselves the daunting
task of explaining How, Why and What Next. On the whole they have
made a good job of it. From regional plans of the International
Monetary Fund to local education systems, from war crimes to
environmental problems to the changing status of women, they give
the reader a handy Baedecker on an increasingly confident continent
and on East Asia in particular. They show a good sense of history
in sketching Asian backgrounds.
</P>
<P>
   Most of all this is a reporter's book in the best sense of the
word. The pace of the writing is a bit breathless _ taking a quick
run barefoot over an entire continent would leave any writer a bit
winded. The authors' views of countries and conditions are anchored
in their searching interviews with the people who live and work
there. These range far and wide. We hear the story of a failed
big-time developer in Thailand, a rickshaw owner in Indonesia, a
child prostitute in Cambodia, a battered wife in Korea, a computer
tycoon and a hard-pressed local factory owner in Japan. What
characterizes almost all of the interviewees is their dedication to
work and their patience and perseverance in the face of adversity
(for this the authors use the classic Japanese term, gaman).
</P>
<P>
   About the Asian economic crisis of 1997-98 they are very good
indeed. They underline three major factors: 1) the lopsided ratio
of short-term economic loans against foreign exchange reserves; 2)
the neglect of regulatory infrastructures and legal safeguards; and
3) the disastrous self-confidence of Asian tycoons, bankers and
governments. They also point out the faults of Western bankers and
international organizations _ the IMF in particular _ in not making
accurate assessments of the crisis and discounting the hardships of
those injured by it.
</P>
<P>
   I agree thoroughly with their first major argument:  &UR; T &LR; he Asian
economic crisis was the best thing that could have happened to
Asia. It entailed a terrific human cost, but it is also helping to
destroy much of the cronyism, protectionism and government
regulation that had burdened Asian business. It helped start a
political, social and economic revolution and forced a greater
reliance on markets, democracy and the rule of law.
</P>
<P>
   I have some major problems with their second argument, which is
that partly because of this forced restructuring, Asia is likely to
wrench economic, diplomatic and military power from the West over
the coming decades. The first problem concerns geographic reach.
Except for some brief sketches of a recently opening India, South
Asia goes largely unreported. If we narrow the authors' focus to
East and Southeast Asia, the similarities and parallel advances
they cite make abundant sense, bringing closer to fulfillment the
early prophecy of the Japanese writer Okakura Tenshin: ``Asia is
one.''
</P>
<P>
   Their reports on villagers dying of pollution are sobering. (The
environment is one of the bleakest prisms through which to view
Asia.) Equally shocking are the interviews of friendly old Japanese
veterans about their World War II atrocities.
</P>
<P>
   Kristof and WuDunn's economic comparisons tell us much about
generally underreported countries like Indonesia and Thailand. I
question some of their political and social assumptions. Their
analysis of China is wise if equivocal. Their analysis of Japan is
something else again. Despite a wealth of reportorial recall,
including their own experiences with Japanese schools, and good
analyses of the banking system's collapse, their reading of Japan's
current society and politics is quite shallow. For one thing they
say surprisingly little about the roots of Japan's current malaise:
the one-party rule of the Liberal Democratic party _ with the
possible exception of the Communist Party of China the most
pervasively corrupt and crony-ridden apparatus in the region.
</P>
<P>
   In fact the disastrous prevalence of dominant single parties _
Indonesia's Golkar and Malaysia's Umno also come to mind _ are as
much a regional characteristic as ingrown national bureaucracies.
</P>
<P>
   For all that they speak of changes over decades, the authors
seem to underrate the political undertow that in so many places
threatens to roil the rising tides of progress. Unquestionably
Asia's demography will ultimately prevail, but it will be a long
time in coming, punctuated by reverses. And economic, diplomatic
and military power will rarely come together. Meanwhile, Asia's
historical time zones remain very, very far apart.
</P>
<P>
   Such cavils aside, Kristof and WuDunn have given us an
impressive and well-researched study of the world's most important
area. Their insights are illumined by their good reporting. It will
be a long time before I forget the mortally sick Chinese villagers,
the riches-to-rags-and-back Thai entrepreneur and the sturdy
citizens of Omiya, not to mention the happy motorcyclist holding up
the severed head.

   (UNDATED) The incessant ringing was bad enough, but when patrons
of the Whiteley Shopping Centre's cinema in London began answering
their cellular telephones mid-movie _ shouting to be heard above
the dialogue _ Nasser Ahmadi knew something had to give.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people were getting so angry that they were leaving the
cinema,'' said Ahmadi, a consultant to Universal Cinemas
International, which operates the multiscreen movie house. ``People
were asking why we didn't do something about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Across the globe, cell phones disturb plays, concerts and films.
Phones ring out during funerals and weddings. They bleep and buzz
in trains, restaurants and bathrooms. Cell-phone-free zones, polite
requests, even icy glares can't seem to stop the ringing and
consequent jabbering.
</P>
<P>
   But Ahmadi found something that does: a cellular telephone
jammer.
</P>
<P>
   Five months ago, he installed the C-Guard cellular telephone
firewall and complaints stopped. Made by an Israeli company called
NetLine, the C-Guard is one of a handful of cell phone jammers
commercially available today.
</P>
<P>
   But don't go looking for one at your neighborhood electronics
store.
</P>
<P>
   ``The technology is illegal in the U.S. and it's our position
that it should be,'' said Travis Larson, spokesman for the Cellular
Telephone Industry Association, based in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   Within their operating radius, jammers prevent wireless phones
from contacting a cellular radio tower. The affected phone behaves
as it would any place where reception is too poor to carry a call.
</P>
<P>
   Users ``don't complain because they don't know what's going
on,'' Ahmadi said. ``There are lots of places where there are
blackouts, anyway. They think it's the construction of the
building, so they come out in the foyer to make their phone
calls.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very Machiavellian but perfectly harmless,'' said
Jonathan Lemel, managing director for Special Electronic Security
Products, U.K. Ltd. of Manchester, England, which manufactures
jammers.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone agrees. The devices are banned in most
industrialized countries, which don't take kindly to disruption of
licensed radio services.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, spectrum is licensed by the FCC (Federal
Communications Commission) and purchased by broadcasters of all
kind to transmit information,'' said Larson, the cellular industry
spokesman. ``And those pieces of spectrum become the property of
those using them for the length of the licenses. So using a jammer
is analogous to taking someone else's property.''
</P>
<P>
   Gil Israeli, NetLine's CEO, counters that if anything's being
stolen, it's the peace and quiet of those of us forced to endure
loud cell phone conversations.
</P>
<P>
   Regulators have no beef with people installing expensive metal
shielding around rooms to block cell phone usage, Israeli observed.
``Our only argument with the FCC is whether people should be
allowed to defend their space actively as well as passively, using
an inexpensive device,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Richard DiSabatini, director of Intelligence Support Group,
Ltd., a jammer maker based in China Lake, Calif., agreed. ``This is
a whole gray area,'' he said. ``If you were in my home and I didn't
want you using your cell phone, why shouldn't I have the right to
block you?''
</P>
<P>
   DiSabatini's firm does not advertise its jammers. It sells them
only for export, to the military, or to those law enforcement
agencies exempted from FCC rules, he said.
</P>
<P>
   At its simplest, jamming any radio device involves transmitting
a signal on the same frequency and at high enough power that the
two signals collide and cancel each other out. The effect is
similar to what happens when you drop two pebbles in still water
and rings of waves radiate out from them. Where the rings meet, the
water becomes smooth.
</P>
<P>
   Cellular telephones, however, are more challenging to jam than
most radio transmissions. Different cellular systems operate over a
wide range of frequencies. Within those frequencies, any single
phone may ``spectrum hop'' to find a band free of interference.
Plus, phones can notch up their power to try to overcome
interference.
</P>
<P>
   Cell phone jammers have to be sophisticated enough to squelch
phone signals without interfering with other devices, from garage
door openers to medical equipment. In addition, they must operate
at power levels high enough to overcome cell phone signals, but not
so high that the jamming effect leaks outside the intended coverage
area.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, leakage is a key reason the FCC and other regulators
refuse to license jammers, Israeli said. But if governments set
specific rules for exactly how much leakage could be tolerated, he
said, NetLine could meet them.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't expect someone in an apartment complex not to use
his TV. We accept that some noise will come from our neighbors, but
we have some idea of what is a reasonable standard,'' Israeli said.
</P>
<P>
   To the cell phone industry, however, leakage isn't the only
problem. Larson noted that more than 118,000 emergency calls are
made each day from cell phones. And what if a doctor in a theater
misses an emergency call because of a jammer?
</P>
<P>
   Surreptitiously cutting off cellular telephone access is like
snipping off the burning tip of a cigarette because you object to
secondhand smoke, jammer foes say. ``The answer is etiquette,
education, making sure people are using their cell phones in ways
that don't invade other people's space,'' Larson said.
</P>
<P>
   Larson's association and many of its member companies, including
cell phone manufacturer Nokia and service provider U.S. Cellular,
are pouring money into public education campaigns to encourage cell
phone users to be more considerate.
</P>
<P>
   The FCC has fielded enough queries about the legality of cell
phone jammers that it issued a notice last year. In it, the agency
warns that jammers violate federal laws that broadly prohibit
interfering with licensed radio spectrum. Owning, manufacturing,
marketing, offering for sale or operating a cell phone jammer is
punishable by an $11,000 fine and up to a year in prison for each
offense, the notice states.
</P>
<P>
   Stern warnings to the contrary, the agency has never seized a
single jammer or prosecuted an operator to the best of his
knowledge, said Richard Welch, associate chief of the FCC's
Enforcement Bureau.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't taken any actions because nobody has complained,''
Welch said, adding that it was possible jammer users were simply
flying under the FCC's radar.
</P>
<P>
   Lemel agreed. When a cell phone doesn't work, he said, ``the
first thing you think isn't, `I'm being jammed.'''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (OPTIONAL TRIM FOLLOWS) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   It's not because they're not in use, if sales are any indicator.
Lemel says the United States is his firm's biggest market for cell
phone blockers. And NetLine, Israeli says, also sells many devices
in the States, though Europe is its largest market.
</P>
<P>
   Both companies sell liberally in Latin America, the Middle East
and Asia, where jammers are used for personal and corporate
security. For example, many South American banks jam cell phones to
prevent robbers from guiding outside accomplices to mug people
who've just made large withdrawals, Israeli said.
</P>
<P>
   Cell phone jammers are readily available on the Internet. Many
can be battery-powered and fit in a pocket or briefcase for people
who would like to enjoy a meal, movie or church service in peace.
</P>
<P>
   A portable C-Guard sells for about $900 and can cover the area
within a 450-foot radius. Lemel's company offers the $890 M2
Jammer, which comes in a briefcase and can block phones within a
maximum radius of 50 feet. It's advertised as ``ideal for the
executive interested in keeping meetings and working lunches free
from external distractions.'' Hubgiant of Taipei, Taiwan, sells its
WAC1000 personal jammer, which has an operating radius of up to 30
feet, for $169. And Uptron of Lucknow, India, offers a full range
of jammers with coverage ranging from 20 feet to over one mile.
</P>
<P>
   Despite cellular industry fears, the majority of jammer sales
aren't to revenge-seeking Luddites, Israeli said. Most go to
business owners, government and police. Law enforcement officers
can use jammers to throw a net of silence over hostage takers.
Corporations use jammers to protect trade secrets. Ahmadi said
three British hospitals evaluated the C-Guards in his theater
before installing them to prevent interference with crucial medical
equipment.
</P>
<P>
   At least one company offers a technological alternative to
jamming, and others are working on them.
</P>
<P>
   Zetron Inc., based in Redmond, Wash., manufactures a system that
can detect cell phones and warn users to turn them off. It can
cover up to a 90-foot radius. BlueLinx Inc. of Charlotte, N.C., is
working on Q-Zone, a system that will turn off cell phones or
silence their ringers when they enter a protected space. It relies
on shortwave technology called Bluetooth that hasn't been widely
adopted by cell phone makers and may not be on the market for
another three to four years. NetLine is developing a similar system
that will work with existing European digital cellular telephones,
but not American devices.
</P>
<P>
   In some countries, jammers are gaining currency as a legitimate
defense against cell phone abusers. In Japan, Tokyo-based Medic
Inc. sold thousands of its Wave Wall jammers to restaurants,
funeral directors and others before the government limited their
sale. Now jammers must be licensed for use in Japan, and used only
in spaces such as live-performance theaters where cell phones are
judged by the government to be a nuisance.
</P>
<P>
   But even that's a victory, says Israeli, who thinks such uses
help governments see that cell phone ``firewalls'' can serve a
legitimate market under controlled conditions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Legislators and government bodies have not yet realized that
(jammers) can fulfill a useful role in society,'' Lemel said. ``One
of these days, they'll wake up to it.''

 &HT;    A new look at ``Grosse Pointe''
 &HT;    By Kevin Thompson
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   And today's Hollywood lesson: Don't mess with Aaron Spelling.
</P>
<P>
   The legendary producer may be about 125 years old, but he still
wields clout in Tinseltown.
</P>
<P>
   Just ask Darren Star. The creator of such hits as ``Beverly
Hills, 90210,'' ``Melrose Place'' and ``Sex and the City'' was at
it again with a new show, ``Grosse Pointe,'' a dead-on,
behind-the-scenes look at the making of a teen soap. Think a
younger version of ``The Larry Sanders Show.'' While the series
attacks the entire teen soap genre, it became quite obvious
``Grosse Pointe'' was aiming many of its wickedly funny barbs at
the campy ``90210.'' In fact, Star even hired actors who looked
like they could stand in for Shannen Doherty, Luke Perry and Tori
Spelling.
</P>
<P>
   Ah, Tori Spelling. Seems her well-heeled pops wasn't too happy
that some of those barbs hit too close to home. On the series, a
red-haired Lindsay Sloane ``Sabrina the Teenage Witch'' plays a
Tori Spelling lookalike whose producer-daddy got her the gig on the
fictional ``Grosse Pointe.''
</P>
<P>
   Nepotism in Hollywood _ imagine that!
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, poppa Spelling's feelings were hurt. So were Tori's.
Spelling called the WB and complained _ loudly.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have some nerve making fun of my no-talent daughter who's
still looking for work,'' Spelling barked to WB suits. Well, I'm
guessing his words sounded something like that.
</P>
<P>
   Spelling also called Star and told him he was not amused. Star
admits Spelling's vehement reaction surprised him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought he would look at it with a greater sense of humor,''
Star says sheepishly. ``When you're a public figure, you'd think
you'd develop a slightly thicker skin.''
</P>
<P>
   Not wanting to risk alienating the mighty Spelling, Star made a
few subtle changes. Sloane's hair is now brown and the nepotism
angle has been dropped.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't really worth fighting to the point of perhaps not
seeing the show on the air,'' Star reasons.
</P>
<P>
   Yeah, OK, but everyone still knows Sloane's character is an
exaggerated _ or perhaps not so exaggerated _ version of Tori.
</P>
<P>
   Sloane, currently co-starring with Kirsten Dunst as a cutthroat
cheerleader in the film ``Bring it On,'' admits she was a bit
confused by all the controversy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I created this character, and then suddenly I'm
reading all of these articles and people are saying that I'm
mimicking somebody or copying somebody,'' Sloane says. ``So, it
kind of makes you think twice about how much credit you may get in
this business.''
</P>
<P>
   So, has Star heard from Doherty or Perry?
</P>
<P>
   Star actually approached Doherty about a cameo, but she was too
busy filming ``Charmed'', the WB's hit drama about three witches.
No word from Perry, who actually has more reason to be upset. Kohl
Sudduth, the actor who plays the hunky Perry clone, is balding and
looks more like, oh, Tim Conway, when the cameras stop rolling.
</P>
<P>
   Star certainly hopes he won't receive any more calls from ticked
off actors or producers.
</P>
<P>
   ``My feeling is nobody form the cast of ``90210'' should be
rushing to identify themselves,'' he says. ``They should just
laugh, say that's funny and that's it's not me.''

ANTIQUES: NAPOLEON'S STYLE ALSO TOOK EUROPE 
</HEADLINE>
   By WENDY MOONAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ Napoleon Bonaparte practically invented public
relations. That's the message you get in the sumptuous exhibition
that the dealer Ariane Dandois has organized here, ``The Empire
Style and Its Conquest of Europe: 1800-1850'' (through Oct. 30).
She decorated 11 rooms in her Place Beauvau gallery with antique
Empire furniture, chandeliers and porcelains from France, Italy,
Spain, Sweden and Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Timed to coincide with the Biennale des Antiquaires, the big
Paris antiques fair that continues through Oct. 1, the Dandois show
has created a lot of buzz. This is partly because she and four
other top Paris dealers _ Segoura, Kugel, Michel Meyer and
Jean-Marie Rossi of Aveline _ all decided not to rent booths this
year. Instead, they each organized shows in their own galleries.
</P>
<P>
   The ambitious Dandois exhibition dazzles with elegant white
Egyptian-style Swedish fauteuils, Russian mahogany armchairs
decorated with brass fillets in the shape of the rising sun,
Italian gueridons resting on gilded goat heads, and lacquered
bronze Spanish stools that sport female Egyptian heads as supports.
</P>
<P>
   The show raises a question: How did the Empire style, created
and perpetuated by Napoleon, come to be adopted by the monarchies
that fought him tooth and nail? In Italy, Spain and Russia, the
style was wholeheartedly embraced by the ruling elites and outlived
the Emperor.
</P>
<P>
   Daniele Kriser, an assistant curator of decorative arts at the
Louvre, mused: ``Is it the power of the style or the power of the
man? Or is it the power of the style of the man?''
</P>
<P>
   ``To many, Napoleon was a god,'' she continued. ``He still is.
People forget the wars. He made France great. He created the civil
code we still use today. After the French Revolution, there was
great enthusiasm for starting a new life: Napoleon was the most
revolutionary force in France, more important than the Revolution
itself. He was an enormous patron of art and artists.''
</P>
<P>
   Her colleague Anne Dion, a Louvre curator specializing in the
19th century, does not credit Napoleon with inventing a new style.
``The Empire style is really the continuation of the Neoclassical
style begun in the reign of Louis XVI,'' she said. ``Napoleon just
put his own stamp on it.''
</P>
<P>
   Where did Napoleon get that stamp? Actually, it was from his
wife, Josephine, said Bernard Chevallier, chief curator of
Malmaison, Josephine's chateau outside of Paris, which is now a
museum. ``In 1799 Josephine and Napoleon lived in Paris next to the
Hotel Chauvelin, a house designed by two young architects, Charles
Percier and Pierre-Francois-Leonard Fontaine. They were not that
well known but they had published a book, `Houses and Palaces of
Rome.' Josephine greatly admired the Chauvelin house.''
</P>
<P>
   Napoleon trusted Josephine to oversee the renovation of
Malmaison. The painter Jean-Louis David brought the architects to
Malmaison, and Josephine hired them on the spot. There was only one
condition. Napoleon was famously impatient (never taking more than
10 minutes to eat a meal) and insisted they take only 10 days to
complete each room. He wanted the house done by 1800.
</P>
<P>
   The architects attacked the interiors at top speed. They put
Roman-style vaulted arches in the library and had ancient
grotesques painted on the walls. Josephine's beloved arabesques,
inspired by the newly rediscovered walls of Pompeii, appeared on
ceilings, textiles and Sevres porcelains. Wall panels sported
depictions of the gods and goddesses of ancient Greece and Rome.
Paris furniture makers created Napoleon's large writing desk with
swan supports and tables with gilt bronze ram heads.
</P>
<P>
   At first, Napoleon hated the results. ``He thought the library
looked like a sacristy and one of the tented rooms resembled a cage
for bears at a fair,'' Chevallier said. But he saw the power of the
symbols. After Malmaison, Napoleon put the two architects in charge
of redecorating the palaces of the Louvre, Fontainebleau,
Saint-Cloud and Compiegne.
</P>
<P>
   Chevallier said that Napoleon once remarked: ``I love antiquity.
Everything that is big is beautiful.''
</P>
<P>
   Percier and Fontaine were perpetuating the ideas of the German
art historian Johann Joachim Winckelmann, who wrote in 1764: ``The
only way for us to become great and, if possible, even inimitable,
is through the imitation of the ancients.''
</P>
<P>
   Napoleon understood this better than anyone. He knew the best
way to legitimize himself was to identify with the heroes of the
ancient past. Right after the conquest of Egypt, he commissioned a
new wallpaper that depicted him standing next to the pyramids of
Giza, delivering peace and liberating the Egyptians from tyranny.
Thereafter, the sphinx appeared on gueridons, furniture and
candelabra. At the Sevres porcelain factory, designers incorporated
pyramids and obelisks into the patterns for the Emperor's new
vases.
</P>
<P>
   At the Biennale, Bernard Steinitz is selling an enormous pair of
Empire mahogany pool-cue holders with gilded brass N's. He said
that the bronzes had been signed by Pierre Thomire, a colleague of
Percier and Fontaine, and that they might have been made for
Napoleon. Galerie Perrin has a vase in Chinese porcelain mounted
with bronze handles in the shape of rams, designed by Thomire.
Jean-Luc Mechiche is selling a pair of Thomire torcheres from 1830.
</P>
<P>
   Dandois is selling a Sevres vase that Napoleon selected as a New
Year's gift for his sister Caroline in 1811. It depicts Napoleon
being crowned by the goddess Victory.
</P>
<P>
   How was the Empire style diffused so quickly abroad? First,
Percier and Fontaine disseminated their work through a series of
engravings, in 1801. They were sent all over Europe, and were
snapped up by Francophiles in Russia and America.
</P>
<P>
   In France, Dandois writes, ``Following the Emperor's example,
the generals and bankers who had brought him to power all rushed to
commission sumptuous furniture in the new style from furniture
makers like Jacob-Desmalter, Bellange and Marcion, and gilt bronzes
from the foremost bronziers, Thomire, Galle and Feuchere.''
(Bellange was commissioned to do much of the furniture for the
Monroe White House after the British burned the building in the War
of 1812.)
</P>
<P>
   Napoleon installed his family on thrones in Italy, the
Netherlands and Germany, Dandois noted. When Lucien Bonaparte was
sent as ambassador to Madrid in 1801, the king, Charles IV,
commissioned Percier and Fontaine to decorate a Pompeiian room,
Casa del Labrador, at the Aranguez Palace. This led the Duchess of
Alba to order Empire furniture, still in the family's Liria Palace
in Madrid. Dandois is selling four bronze stools with Egyptian
heads from the Casa del Labrador.
</P>
<P>
   When Napoleon's sister Caroline and her husband became queen and
king of Naples, they redecorated the royal palaces of Naples,
Caserta and Portici with Empire furniture and gilt bronzes from
Paris, said Dandois, who is selling four gilded armchairs from
Naples, circa 1810.
</P>
<P>
   Napoleon's sister Elisa Bacciochi was sent to Lucca, Italy, and
then Florence. In 1809 she became grand duchess of Tuscany and
began to commission suites of Empire pieces.
</P>
<P>
   So the Empire style spread. Until, amazingly, it was adopted by
the Bourbons as the court style when they returned to power.

`FINAL CUT' FLUNKS FILM-SCHOOL BASICS
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 By CHRISTOPHER KELLY 
 c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Urban Legends: Final Cut,'' the sequel to 1998's surprisingly
inventive and stylish serial-killer thriller ``Urban Legends,'' is
set at a film school. Why, then, one might wonder, are there
periodic shots of rowing team practices? (Was Martin Scorsese a
former coxswain there?) Why do characters occasionally say things
like ``There's trouble in the film department'' _ after all,
wouldn't the whole school qualify as the ``film department''? And
why does no one on this sprawling campus _ which somehow has an
abandoned amusement park on the grounds _ ever enter a classroom?
</P>
<P>
   In the original film, a killer stalked university students by
acting out ritualistic murders based on famous ``urban legends'' _
a man hiding in a back seat of a woman's car, or a boyfriend
leaving his girlfriend to go for help after they've broken down in
the middle of nowhere and ending up getting hung from a tree.
</P>
<P>
   ``Final Cut'' is aiming to do similar things. Or at least I
think it is. This time a student named Amy (Jennifer Morrison) is
making a film about an ``urban legend'' killer. Get ready for more
elaborately designed murders, right? But while you're still
puzzling over my earlier questions, here are a few more to
consider: Is there actually an urban legend about a guy who gets
bludgeoned when he goes outside to smoke a cigarette? Is there one
where someone gets electrocuted by errant props from a movie set?
</P>
<P>
   There's an irony here _ for a movie set at a film school,
``Final Cut'' is pretty much a textbook case on how not to make a
movie. The tone shifts from scene to scene, from ``Scream''-style
postmodern glibness to ``Friday the 13th''-esque humorless
bloodletting. The images look terrible, with about half the scenes
bathed in cruddy gray light, and the other half barely lighted at
all. And the slasher sequences emerge as patched-together visual
quotes from at least three dozen other movies, among them ``Peeping
Tom,'' ``Blowup'' and ``Reservoir Dogs.'' The
director/editor/composer John Ottman, University of Southern
California class of 1988, seems determined to prove to audiences
that he actually graduated from a film school.
</P>
<P>
   The movie also features one of those plots for which the word
``inexplicable'' was pretty much invented. There's a gang of young
would-be filmmakers running around, all competing for the school's
coveted Alfred Hitchcock prize for best student film. One of these
students, the handsome and brooding Travis (Matthew Davis),
``commits suicide'' after getting a C-minus on his film. But it
wasn't suicide _ and his twin brother arrives on the scene to get
to the bottom of things!
</P>
<P>
   Much mayhem ensues, but if you're still paying attention after
30 minutes, you must have a higher tolerance for slapdash
screenwriting and jumble-edited mutilation than most. The cast of
mostly newcomers is squandered: Ottman makes the mistake of killing
off his best-looking and most charismatic actor (Marco
Hofschneider, as a cocky Eastern European cinematographer) almost
as soon as he enters the movie.
</P>
<P>
   So why shouldn't ``Urban Legends: Final Cut'' be quickly
forgotten and dispatched to late-night cable TV? For one, the
original film is a marvel of imagination and dexterous execution _
from its genuinely scary opening sequence to the confident manner
in which director Jamie Blanks establishes and sustains his cool,
breezy tone. The whole film is obviously inspired by ``Scream,''
but in many ways, it's a looser and smarter work.
</P>
<P>
   The American B-movie thriller is a grand tradition in its own
right, but it has also provided a training ground for directors who
went on to far greater achievements (Scorsese, Jonathan Demme). I'm
hardly suggesting that the original ``Urban Legends'' marked the
arrival of a great new movie artist (Blanks, unfortunately, hasn't
worked since, making it even harder to judge how genuine his talent
was), but it did prove that when a young director approaches this
kind of material with a hunger to prove his mettle, real sparks can
fly.
</P>
<P>
   There's no reason ``Final Cut'' couldn't have inspired the same
kind of energy. My guess is that Ottman fell into the age-old trap
of underestimating his audience; he automatically assumed that
everyone out there would treat his movie as dismissively as most
mainstream critics have always treated the genre.
</P>
<P>
   But that kind of thinking doesn't make good movies. It just
proves an age-old adage (if not an urban legend): Stupid is as
stupid does.

   ``The Management Century: A Critical Review of 20th Century
Thought and Practice''
</P>
<P>
   by Stuart Crainer, Jossey-Bass, $28
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   Management, Stuart Crainer writes in ``The Management Century,''
has been practiced since the dawn of civilization but has been
``recognized, analyzed, monitored, taught, and formalized'' only
for 100 years.
</P>
<P>
   Crainer says effective management demands constant change and
development, yet success often breeds inertia and resistance to
change, which leads to serious consequences for managers and their
companies.
</P>
<P>
   This book considers the 20th century's management innovators,
successes and failures in 10 readable chapters, each covering a
decade.
</P>
<P>
   The earliest management concept covered in the book is stopwatch
science, invented by Frederick Winslow Taylor. He used time and
motion studies to streamline workers' movements and help managers
set production quotas.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor's method led to higher production and lower costs per
unit for everything from automobiles to brooms, but it dehumanized
workers and bred controversy, labor revolts and congressional
investigations. The stopwatch's fall from grace was so complete
that, in 1912, Congress enacted a law forbidding their use in
government offices. Even so, Taylor's processes remain a powerful
influence on production lines.
</P>
<P>
   Henry Ford dominated the 1911-1920 decade. His wildly successful
Model T rolled off assembly lines by the millions, transforming the
United States into an automobile economy and culture. But Ford's
innovative spirit died early as the money rolled in, and he kept
his production lines spewing out funeral-black Model Ts long after
they were obsolete.
</P>
<P>
   His management of people, based on intimidation and mistrust,
was appalling. Crainer calls Ford ``in many ways an archetypal
example of how not to do things.''
</P>
<P>
   While Ford hung doggedly onto the Tin Lizzie, General Motors
President Alfred Sloan built an empire on a new management concept:
decentralization. During the '20s, GM produced cars in attractive
colors and further developed its market with annual styling changes
and improvements.
</P>
<P>
   In 1927, GM passed Ford in the number of autos sold. Yet for all
its colossal success, GM fell victim to the same bug as Ford:
failure to adjust. Sloan's ideas, so right for the times when they
were concocted, later created problems that GM is still trying to
resolve.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor, Ford, Sloan and other moguls of the first three decades
had this in common: They regarded employees as production line
machines that could be controlled like a lathe or drill press.
</P>
<P>
   ``We expect the men to do as they are told,'' Ford said.
</P>
<P>
   Ethics had nothing to do with management practices.
</P>
<P>
   Then things changed. Unexpected outcomes of production-line
studies at Western Electric's Hawthorne plant between 1927 and 1932
revealed that humane treatment of employees could increase
production. The studies happened to coincide with the Great
Depression and made the human side of business the abiding issue of
the 1930s _ and a large influence on management.
</P>
<P>
   The New Deal played a central role in implementing the concept,
as improved working conditions and new laws _ the 40-hour workweek,
minimum wage, Social Security, abolishment of child labor _ came
rapidly. No enlightened entrepreneur since that time would think of
starting a business without including commitment to human
relations. Yet Crainer implies that some hot management concepts of
the past half-century have helped some managers turn back the
calendar to the human machine days.
</P>
<P>
   Highly touted 20th-century fads include management by objective,
strategic planning, total quality management and re-engineering.
Crainer says that such concepts may lead to cost-cutting,
reorganization and downsizing under the guise of following
fashionable management theory.
</P>
<P>
   In analyzing the effect of some of the more conspicuous ideas,
Crainer writes: ``The similarities with Taylor's management by
scientific dictatorship are most obvious. Nothing better
exemplifies this pattern than the rise ... and inevitable fall of
process reengineering.''
</P>
<P>
   The basis of that concept (made famous by the book
``Reengineering the Corporation'' by James Champy and Michael
Hammer) is that organizations need to identify their key processes
and make them as lean and efficient as possible. As a result,
peripheral processes (and peripheral people) are discarded.
</P>
<P>
   The most positive and entertaining parts of Crainer's book are
those that describe the innovators with universal impact, such as
W.E. Deming, Peter Drucker and Tom Peters.
</P>
<P>
   Then there are the uplifting corporate stories, exemplified by
Dell Computers and Toyota, which established standards of
leadership that even now, decades later, competitors are still
striving to emulate.
</P>
<P>
   Crainer cuts no slack for the hubris and inertia that have
penalized some leading U.S. managers and business leaders, but this
is nonetheless a positive and well-packaged summary of 100 years of
management evolution.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Management Century'' is an easy read, and I recommend it.

CRUZ SHINES IN ``WOMAN ON TOP'' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WILLIAM ARNOLD  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   For almost a year now, the little Fox Searchlight company has
been beating the drum for its intriguingly titled
``erotic-romantic'' food comedy, ``Woman on Top,'' which it's been
bravely predicting is going to be the art-house hit of the fall _
the 2000 version of ``Like Water for Chocolate.''
</P>
<P>
   It could happen, too. It may be as calculated for success as a
computer program, but the combination of food, sex, giddy Latin
American mysticism and fast-rising Spanish star Penelope Cruz is a
formidable one, and the movie is darn hard to resist.
</P>
<P>
   Cruz plays Isabella, a beautiful young Brazilian woman with a
chronic motion sickness that keeps manifesting itself in various
awkward ways, and a rare gift for sensuous cooking that has made a
big success out of her beachfront Bahia restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   But when she finds her handsome young husband, Toninho (Murilo
Benicio) in bed with a neighbor, she flies the coop to San
Francisco, where she moves in with her transvestite childhood pal
(Harold Perrineau Jr.) and soon stumbles her way into a hit TV
cooking show: ``Passion Food Live.''
</P>
<P>
   The heartbroken and genuinely contrite Toninho is soon in
pursuit, and the rest of the movie deals with his efforts to get
his wife back, which are complicated by the fact that she's taken
part in a voodoo spell that's irreversibly destroyed her love for
him.
</P>
<P>
   The film is rated R, which seems incomprehensible, since it's as
innocent (and about as graphic) as an episode of ``Bewitched.''
Indeed, the bulk of its much ballyhooed ``eroticism'' seems to be
in the ad campaign, and anyone expecting a major sizzler is bound
to be disappointed.
</P>
<P>
   As a goofy little fantasy, however, this film has loads of
charm, milking a maximum of situation comedy from its screwball
``affliction''-premise, and a maximum of romantic atmosphere from
its culinary exploits, bossa nova soundtrack and dreamy Brazilian
and San Francisco locations.
</P>
<P>
   The film also has an especially good supporting cast, including
Perrineau, who has to be the last word in outrageously gay,
heroine's best friends; and South American heart-throb Benicio, who
seems destined to be the new decade's successor to Antonio
Banderas.
</P>
<P>
   Adding to the blessings is a clever script by first-time
screenwriter Vera Blasi, and just the right touch in the direction
of Fina Torres, a Venezuelan-born filmmaker who fulfills some of
the big promise she showed in her equally delightful 1996 comedy,
``Celestial Clockwork.''
</P>
<P>
   But ``Woman on Top'' works mostly as a vehicle for former Pedro
Almodovar star Cruz (``All About My Mother,'' ``Live Flesh''),
whose sex appeal, wonky vulnerability and instinctive flair for
comedy have never before been quite so winningly showcased _ or
seemed more destined for major Hollywood stardom.

   CAMPAIGN-ROUNDUP (Undated) _ Vice President Al Gore, using his
power of incumbency to tackle what he calls a ``national crisis,''
persuades President Clinton to consider tapping into the nation's
petroleum stockpile in order to drive down the price of oil. Texas
Gov. George W. Bush, a former oil company executive, says Gore's
bid for emergency intervention is an election-year gimmick. He

oil prices by expanding U.S. production. By STEWART M. POWELL.

   ``Adventures in Wild California'' Unrated
</P>
<P>
   An Imax film.
</P>
<P>
   Review: You've got to hand it to the makers of the Imax movie
``Adventures in Wild California.'' Their movie will keep kids
slack-mouthed with excitement as they watch the extreme-sport
antics of athletic daredevils: tree climbers, snowboarders, skiers
and surfers. (SM) 40 minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``Almost Famous'' R (profanity, sexual situations, and substance
abuse)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Patrick Fugit, Billy Crudup and Kate Hudson.
</P>
<P>
   Review: Cameron Crowe's (``Jerry Maguire'') exhuberant and
knowing movie grabs the soul of rock and roll and blissfully
re-creates the early '70s, a time poised between one water sign
(the Age of Aquarius) and another (Watergate). Drawing on his own
experiences, Crowe gives us a 15-year-old rock fan (Patrick Fugit)
who, in 1973, convinces Rolling Stone magazine to send him on the
road with an emerging group called Stillwater. He learns about sex,
drugs, rock 'n' roll and stomach pumps. He also learns why the
music matters _ and always will matter. (ERG) 2 hours. A-
</P>
<P>
   ``An Affair of Love'' R (sex and nudity) Subtitles.
</P>
<P>
   Starring Nathalie Baye and Sergi Lopez.
</P>
<P>
   Review: An extremely French wisp of a film with a lingering
whiff of needless romantic tragedy. A man and a woman (Sergi Lopez
and Nathalie Baye) _ we never learn their names _ meet through an
ad she placed concerning a certain sexual fantasy. Falling into bed
is easy but things get difficult when it looks like they're falling
in love. Though it sounds like a Gallic chick flick, keep in mind
the original title was ``A Pornographic Affair,'' and that it's a
rueful, tender movie about sex and love. (ERG) 1 hour, 20 minutes.
B+
</P>
<P>
   ``Backstage''
</P>
<P>
   A hip-hop documentary. Rated R (strong language, nudity
</P>
<P>
   and drug content)
</P>
<P>
   Review: A hip-hop documentary, the behind-the-scenes film about
the 1999 Hard Knocks Life tour is less a documentary than a home
movie, intercutting stage-show clips with endless bad-boy behavior.
To its credit, ``Backstage'' doesn't pull any punches. It never
tries to show its rapping crews as misunderstood artists. As Kevin
Liles, president of Def Jam Records puts it, ``It's all about
getting the (expletive) money.'' (SM)1 hour, 27 minutes. C
</P>
<P>
   ``Bait'' R (profanity and violence)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Jamie Foxx, David Morse and Kimberly Elise.
</P>
<P>
   Review: May not hook you completely, but give it a chance.
Underneath the usual action-comedy trappings is an entertaining
and, on occasion, clever movie. Jamie Foxx stars as a small-time
crook who, without his knowledge, is released from jail with a
tracking device planted on him. The scheme, hatched by some federal
agents, is to lure a high-tech criminal out of hiding. A bit of
``The Truman Show'' emerges as the agents watching Foxx come to
care about him. Foxx, who provides the box-office bait, delivers a
fresh and charming performance reminiscent of early Eddie Murphy.
(ERG)1 hour, 50 minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``Bless the Child'' R (violence, drug content and brief
profanity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Kim Basinger and Jimmy Smits.
</P>
<P>
   Review: A junky would-be religious thriller about a little girl
with special powers. The latest cinematic struggle of good vs.
evil, the film swipes everything it can from ``The Omen,'' ``The
Exorcist,'' ``End of Days,'' ``Stigmata'' and other
Catholic/satanic epics, all while managing to bore the pants off
you. (SM) 1 hour, 50 minutes. D+

   ``Bring It On'' PG-13 (sex-related material and profanity)

<P>
   Starring Kirsten Dunst.
</P>
<P>
   Review: Kirsten Dunst stars in a comedy that pits two rival high
schools' cheerleading squads in a we-hate-you showdown at the
national cheerleading championships. Pretty much all the jokes fall
flat. Actually, the funniest bit involves projectile vomiting. And
what does that say about this movie? (BL) 1 hour, 33 minutes. C-

   ``The Cell'' R (violence, language and nudity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Jennifer Lopez, Vince Vaughn and Vincent D'Onofrio.
</P>
<P>
   Review: Don't get trapped in this one. Jennifer Lopez plays an
intrepid child therapist who, through an experimental sci-fi
technique, can enter the minds of others. A detective (Vince
Vaughn) asks her to stroll through the brain of a serial killer
(Vincent D'Onofrio) so he can find where he's stashed his latest
victim. Visually provocative, narratively impaired, it's like ``The
Silence of the Lambs'' without the compelling characters. (ERG)1
hour, 52 minutes.

</P>
<P>
   Starring Piper Perabo, Adam Garcia, Maria Bello and

<P>
   John Goodman.
</P>
<P>
   Review: Dog-face hideous. The come-on is five hot chicks serving
liquor in a rowdy fun-time saloon (they splash whiskey across the
bar and set it afire; they douse each others' T-shirts with big
pitchers of water). But it's really the slapdash story of a young
waif, a struggling songwriter aching for stardom in New York City.
``Coyote'' is profoundly stupid and earnestly inept at conveying a
story. (BL) 1 hour, 34 minutes. D

<P>
   (sexual content, violence and profanity)

   Starring Richard Dreyfuss and Burt Reynolds.
</P>
<P>
   Review: It stereotypes Jews and Hispanics and belittles the
group it's supposed to be celebrating, retirement-age Americans.
Even worse, the movie's not even funny. The stars are old mafia
wiseguys trying to fight a rent increase in their Miami hotel. Lame
plot twists and accidents ensue. (SM)1 hour, 28 minutes. F

   ``Croupier'' Unrated

<P>
   Starring Clive Owen and Alex Kingston.
</P>
<P>
   Review: This 1998 film involves a struggling author who takes a
job at a casino running a roulette wheel to look for writing
inspiration. Soon he's convinced to join a robbery scheme.
``Croupier'' has more on its mind than danger and plot twists. It's
a fascinating, hard-edged portrait of a man who swears he doesn't
gamble. (SM) 1 hour, 31 minutes. A-

   ``Disney's The Kid'' PG (mild profanity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Bruce Willis and Spencer Breslin.
</P>
<P>
   Review: Bruce Willis may grow tired of being upstaged by
children. Haley Joel Osment ran off with last year's ``The Sixth
Sense,'' and this time, 8-year-old Spencer Breslin steals what
little thunder there is to rumble about in this sickly sweet film.

   Review: Off-key. Gwyneth Paltrow, Andre Braugher and Huey Lewis
are among six characters, each caught up in a personal drama,
headed for a big karaoke contest in Omaha. Sort've like a ``Love

A-list Oscar winner appearing in a dismal little movie about
karaoke? Check out the name of the director/producer. It's Bruce

<P>
   Review: Two thousand _ or, if you want to add computer effects,
200,000 _ thumbs up for Ridley Scott's spectacle starring Russell
Crowe as a Roman general, who returns to the Colosseum to take
revenge on the odious Emperor Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix). The
battles staged before the mob of mindless ancient Romans are the
film's centerpieces, but its brave heart (so to speak) is Crowe.

   ``Gone in 60 Seconds'' PG-13 (sexuality, profanity and violence)

<P>
   Starring Nicolas Cage and Angelina Jolie.
</P>
<P>
   Review: Nicolas Cage plays Memphis Raines, a reformed car thief
called back behind the wheel when his little brother bungles a deal
for a British crime lord. If you sit through the usual formula
garbage, ``Gone'' delivers a long, harrowing car chase that easily
outdoes the motorcycle finale in ``Mission Impossible: 2.'' A few
IQ points may be lost while watching the flick. But you'll be
having too much fun to care. (SM) 1 hour, 59 minutes. B-

   ``Hollow Man'' R (graphic violence, nudity, profanity)
</P>

<P>
   Review: A high-tech fusion of ``The Invisible Man'' and ``Dr.
Jekyll and Mr. Hyde,'' it lets director Paul Verhoeven (``Starship
Troopers,'' ``Total Recall'') show off some gruesome,
state-of-the-art computer effects and exercise his gleeful brand of
brutal action. But his filmmaking energy is wasted on a weak script
and characters so two-dimensional, they're virtually all
transparent. (SM) 1 hour, 54 minutes. C

   ``The Life and Times of Hank Greenberg'' Not rated.
</P>
<P>
   A documentary about baseball player Hank Greenberg.
</P>
<P>
   Review: Aviva Kempner's documentary is a rare film indeed _ a
celebration of Hank Greenberg, a pro baseball player in the 1930s
and '40s who became the first Jewish sports superstar. Greenberg
broke records, was voted most valuable player twice and led his
team, the Detroit Tigers, to two World Series _ even as he was
being subjected to anti-Semitic baiting by fans, rivals and,
sometimes, his own teammates. Jackie Robinson puts it best: ``Mr.
Greenberg was class.'' So is his movie. (ERG) 1 hour, 35 minutes.

</P>
<P>
   Review: Renee Zellweger's otherworldly sweetness is used to
great effect in ``Nurse Betty,'' a dark fantasy. Like a collision
between ``Being There,'' ``The Wizard of Oz'' and early Coen
brothers, you've seen it before, but you've never seen anything
quite like this. Zellweger plays a waitress in search of her
long-lost love, a soap opera character, and steals a Buick to find
him. Two problems. The Buick is full of drugs, and hitmen Charlie
(Morgan Freeman) and Wesley (Chris Rock) are soon on her trail.

   ``Nutty Professor 2: The Klumps'' PG-13 (crude humor and sexual

<P>
   Starring Eddie Murphy and Janet Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   Review: The big problem in ``Nutty Professor II: The Klumps'' is
the nutty professor. This sequel to the 1996 hit seems designed for
video: You want to fast-forward through all the parts focused on
tubby scientist Sherman (Eddie Murphy) so you can get back to the
rest of his family (played by Murphy, Murphy, Murphy and Murphy,
plus a fat kid). Murphy is jaw-droppingly funny. But the script is
simply not nutty enough. (SM) 1 hour, 45 minutes. C+

Bernie Mac.
</P>
<P>
   Review: There's nothing that original. It's just a lot of funny
stuff knocked out by four sharp stand-up comics. And under Spike
Lee's direction, it's one of the liveliest concert films in years.
The routines get raucous and rude, but hold off on the blistering
verbal assaults of other comedians. Lee looses several cameras
through the venue, capturing audience reactions and giving the
movie the dynamic spark of the live event. (SM) 1 hour, 57 minutes.

   Review: The fishermen of the Andrea Gail take a pounding, and so
does the audience in the latest movie directed by Wolfgang
Petersen. Based on Sebastian Junger's best seller, it re-creates
the collision of three weather systems in the fall of 1991 _ and
the battle of men (George Clooney, Mark Wahlberg) and women (Mary
Elizabeth Mastrantonio) trying to survive the monstrous sea. (SM) 2

   ``Personals'' Unrated (contains adult themes and profanity.)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Malik Yoba, Stacey Dash and Sheryl Lee Ralph. Part of
BlackFilmFestAmerica's independent movie tour.
</P>
<P>
   Review: A sometimes witty, but thoroughly slow-going
relationship comedy. Malik Yoba (TV's ``New York Undercover'')
plays Keith, a New York journalist juggling a few too many personal
items. Like two girlfriends, a boss who wants to fire him, and
friends who see all too clearly through Keith's ``I'm OK'' veneer.
His saving grace may be his final assignment: date 30 women in 30

   Review: It's got it all. Bone-crunching football plays.
Boneheaded comedy (the team kicker, a wire-thin Welsh soccer
player, puffs cigs while booting field goals). And a dumb-as-dirt
pep squad whose sideline lap-dance cheers cause the opposition to
fumble a lot. Keanu Reeves and Gene Hackman star in this dumb romp
about adult scabs taking over for striking pro players. (BL)1 hour,

   Review: A guiltless, feel-good flick in the ``Waking Ned
Devine'' mold. The film has everything it takes to be hopelessly
twee: steaming teacups and scenic seascapes, eccentric villagers, a
rowdy pub and some naughty business involving marijuana. But to the
credit of everyone involved, especially Brenda Blethyn in the title
role, the comedy mainly skirts the pitfalls of preciousness. (SM)

</P>
<P>
   Review: Propped up by the Wayans brothers _ Keenen
(writer/director), Shawn (writer/actor) and Marlon (writer/actor);
and they are a talented bunch _ ``Scary Movie'' is a parody of teen
horror flicks. The ``Scream'' trilogy, ``I Know What You Did Last
Summer,'' ``The Blair Witch Project'' and, just because it was
popular, ``The Matrix'' all get skewered in a thousand jokes that
are either hilarious, mildly funny, not funny, crude, or absolutely
offensive. (BL) 1 hour, 28 minutes. C+

   Review: The right stuff. Geezer chic gets a grand showcase in
Clint Eastwood's shamelessly crowd-pleasing comedy-thriller. When a
decrepit Russian satellite threatens to crash to Earth, four aging
astronauts who were axed from the program in the '50s are summoned
into service to repair the thing. The best part of the film is
watching these veterans play off each other like seasoned pros on

   ``The Tao of Steve'' R (profanity and drug use)

   Review: A slight and slightly obnoxious romantic comedy about a
chunky nonhunk (Donal Logue) who's a babe magnet because he
practices the so-called tao of Steve, i.e., the way to get girls is
to emulate the sheer coolness of Steve McQueen. The twist comes
when this lumpen Lothario falls for a set designer (Greer Goodman)
impervious to his method. Logue can be charming, but the whole
premise seems contrived and a bit false. (ERG)1 hour, 30 minutes.

</P>
<P>
   Review: Based on ``Ghetto Supastar,'' both the CD and
young-adult novel by hip-hop star Pras (aka the Fugee's Prakerzel
Michel), ``Turn It Up'' is a flashy, loud urban thriller that wants
to critique the guns-and-bullets world of thug life, while at the
same time reveling in its perks. It's a cautionary tale that isn't
quite sure what it wants to caution the audience about. (SM) 1

   ``Urban Legends: Final Cut'' Rated R (violence/gore, language
and some sexuality)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Jennifer Morrison and Matthew Davis.
</P>
<P>
   Review: Please let it be final. University film students get
whacked in this slasher film with loose connections to ``Urban
Legend.'' The characters are all interchangeably gorgeous and
equally shallow. First-time director John Ottman manages to crank
some suspense out of a couple of chase scenes, but he can't bring
life to a movie formula that is now dead dead dead. (SM)1 hour, 34
minutes. D+

<P>
   ``The Watcher'' R (violence and language)
</P>
<P>
   Starring James Spader, Keanu Reeves.
</P>
<P>
   Review: There's a resonant 21st-century theme in ``The
Watcher,'' an otherwise standard serial-killer thriller. A sicko
named Griffin (Keanu Reeves) stalks pretty women and uses a burnt
out detective, named Campbell (James Spader), as his main pawn.
Debut director Joe Charbanic manages to wring some suspense out of
stock situations. Too often, though, he falls back on cliches,
including heavy breathing on the soundtrack, and an arty reliance
on blurry slo-mo flashbacks. (SM) 1 hour, 33 minutes. C+

   Starring Ryan Phillippe, Benicio Del Toro and Juliette Lewis.

<P>
   Review: An Oscar winner for his ``Usual Suspects'' screenplay,
Christopher McQuarrie makes a sluggishly paced directing debut in
the tale of a couple of lowlifes named Parker (Ryan Phillippe) and
Longbaugh (Benicio Del Toro). Though it's not exactly original, the
movie is so intent on an air of existential grunge, it becomes
suffocating and pretentious. (SM) 2 hours. D

   ``What Lies Beneath'' PG-13 (terror, violence, sensuality,
profanity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Michelle Pfeiffer and Harrison Ford.
</P>
<P>
   Review: What lies beneath this film is a script that could have
come from a 1970s TV movie. Narratively old-fashioned, but boosted
by star performances from Michelle Pfeiffer and Harrison Ford and
suspenseful direction, it's a lovingly crafted throwback to
haunted-house movies that relied more on suggestion and slowly
building creepiness than great effects. (SM)2 hours, 10 minutes. B-

   ``Woman on Top'' R (some strong sexuality and language)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Penelope Cruz and Murilo Benicio.

   Review: Despite some tasty ingredients, it's a screen confection
that never quite gels. Mix together the stories of Gabriel Garcia
Marquez, ``Like Water for Chocolate,'' a few Food Network series
and lots of dreamy samba, and you'll get the recipe. Call it Magic
Realism Lite. Though it's packed with cooking scenes and shots of
steaming food, the movie's spiciest ingredient _ and the main
reason to see it _ is Spanish actress Penelope Cruz. (SM) 1 hour,
33 minutes. C+

 &HT;    1900s exploration's icy fate
 &HT;    By Steve Murray
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   You could call ``South'' the coolest (literally) home movie
you'll ever see _ except that there's no home involved. The setting
of this silent 1919 film is the icy, indifferent landscape of the
Antarctic, where Sir Ernest Shackleton led an expedition of fellow
Brits in October 1914. He and his men weren't seen again until May
1916. It looked as though they'd been swallowed alive by the South
Pole.
</P>
<P>
   They almost were. Their ship, the Endurance, became trapped by
ice for nine months, and ultimately crushed by the pressure. From
then on, the men lived in tents, floating on icebergs along with
their supplies and more than 70 sled dogs, until Shackleton and
five crew members set out in a 20-foot boat to seek help.
</P>
<P>
   It's tricky to call ``South'' a documentary. It's more a raw
document, consisting of footage shot by Frank Hurley over more than
a year of hardship, the segments strung together with explanatory
intertitles. The quality varies tremendously. Yes, we get shots of
the Endurance's masts snapping and crashing as the ship is squeezed
to splinters by the ice. But other crucial events aren't on film.
</P>
<P>
   Probably because of poor lighting conditions, the camera never
takes us inside the ship, and we never really get to know any of
the Endurance's crew. Instead, Hurley spends a lot of time shooting
seals, penguins and the hardworking sled dogs.
</P>
<P>
   It's a little like an amateur wedding video _ you wish the
shooter had paid more attention to the newlyweds fighting on the
dance floor, rather than the adorable antics of the flower girl.
Despite these flaws, ``South'' is a fascinating artifact, and an
understated tribute to men who managed to escape what at times must
have appeared to be a lonely, icy demise.

 &HT;    A `Legend'-ary waste
 &HT;    By Steve Murray
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   No, really, I swear this is true. I know because it happened to
the brother-in-law of one of my best friend's old frat buddies.
Honest!
</P>
<P>
   See, he went to a sneak preview of a slasher flick called
``Urban Legends: Final Cut,'' which is a kind-of sort-of sequel to
``Urban Legend'' two years ago. But in the new movie, the killings
aren't based on urban legends. Well, except for the first one,
which is the nastiest and best, and which has absolutely nothing to
do with the rest of the flick.
</P>
<P>
   No, this time we're at a college boasting ``the greatest film
school that ever existed,'' in the words of perpetually stubbled
professor Solomon (Hart Bochner), who represents the faculty on a
campus that (as in the first movie) seems to have no students
besides the 10-odd marked-for-death characters.
</P>
<P>
   Virtually the only other adult is security guard Reese (Loretta
Devine, the one holdover from the '98 film), who's been directed to
overdo her sassy sistah routine, watching Pam Grier movies on her
video monitors instead of protecting students from a crazed killer.
(Even better, after one student narrowly escapes the psycho, who
wears a fencing mask, Reese basically pooh-poohs her story.)
</P>
<P>
   Oh, about the students: There's our heroine, Amy (Jennifer
Morrison), an aspiring director who decides to make her thesis film
about urban legends (thus the tenuous connection to the earlier
flick). Also: Travis (Matthew Davis), the school's most admired
young talent; Graham (Joseph Lawrence), a pampered cad with a
Hollywood dad; Toby (Anson Mount), a hothead; Vanessa (Eva Mendes),
a feisty lesbian who's a ringer for Gina Gershon; and Sandra
(Jessica Cauffiel), a slutty young actress whose intentionally bad
performance in a student film is a highlight of ``UL:FC.''
</P>
<P>
   There's also Marco Hofschneider, who had to play scenes buck
naked in 1991's ``Europa Europa.'' In retrospect that was probably
a lot less embarrassing than appearing in this movie.
</P>
<P>
   The students are all movie-mad, and several are aiming to win
the school's Hitchcock prize for filmmaking. Something ``Urban
Legends: Final Cut'' would never in a million years win. The script
is so self-reflective and movie-obsessed, you may think you've
wandered into a bad remake of ``Scream 3.'' You'd be right.
</P>
<P>
   The characters are all interchangeably gorgeous and equally
shallow; watching them get killed off is about as disturbing as
seeing moths burnt by a candle flame. First-time director John
Ottman manages to crank some suspense out of a couple of chase
scenes, but he can't bring life to a movie formula that is now dead
dead dead.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, but I forgot my main point. I was telling you about the
brother-in-law of one of my best friend's old frat buddies. Halfway
through the movie, he got up and snuck into another theater playing
``Almost Famous.'' I couldn't go, because I had to see the whole
thing and write this review. Isn't that the scariest thing you ever
heard?

 &HT;    Pretty `Woman' an airy confection
 &HT;    By Steve Murray
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Despite some tasty ingredients, ``Woman on Top'' is a screen
confection that never quite gels. Mix together the stories of
Gabriel Garcia Marquez, ``Like Water for Chocolate,'' a few Food
Network series and lots of dreamy samba, and you'll get the recipe.
Call it Magic Realism Lite.
</P>
<P>
   Though it's packed with cooking scenes and shots of steaming
food, the movie's spiciest ingredient _ and the main reason to see
it _ is Spanish actress Penelope Cruz. A star of ``All About My
Mother'' and the upcoming ``All the Pretty Horses,'' she plays
Isabella, a Brazilian beauty born with severe motion sickness. She
gets queasy riding in cars, elevators, airplanes, anything. If she
does the driving herself, though, she's OK. And when it comes to
sex ... well, that's where the title comes in.
</P>
<P>
   Blessed with a genius for cooking, she wows and weds
restaurateur Toninho (Murilo Benicio). He loves her madly but,
well, this woman-on-top thing makes him feel a bit unmanned.
</P>
<P>
   One night, fulfilling his missionary needs with another woman,
he's discovered by Isabella. She flees heartbroken to San Francisco
to stay with her friend Monica ... who happens to be a tall drag
queen played by Harold Perrineau Jr.
</P>
<P>
   Did I forget to mention there's a savory pinch of Pedro
Almodovar in the movie, too?
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, the smell of Isabella's cooking bewitches her entire Bay
area neighborhood, including Cliff (Mark Feuerstein), a TV producer
who promptly hires her to host her own show, ``Passion Food.'' As
gifted as she is with cuisine, the show's ratings also get a boost
from Isabella's tight red dress and cleavage. ``Make sure your
tomatoes are full and plump,'' she advises viewers. In case we miss
the naughty sexual vibe, we get to watch her rub little phallic
chile peppers along her lips.
</P>
<P>
   Cruz is so appealing she overcomes the movie's half-hearted
salaciousness.
</P>
<P>
   It helps that the director and screenwriter are women; they
showcase their stunning star without reducing her to boy-toy. But
as the plot of the movie gets complicated _ the casting of voodoo
love spells, romantic intervention by a sea goddess, Isabella's
dual courtship by Cliff and penitent Toninho, and the arrival of
network bigwigs to check out the TV show _ it goes slack when it
should be tightening up.
</P>
<P>
   The movie maintains the lazy-sexy tempo of one of the sambas
Toninho is always singing.
</P>
<P>
   That's not such a bad thing. ``Woman on Top'' doesn't overstay
its welcome.
</P>
<P>
   Short and sweet, it's suitable for a date night that includes
both a movie and dinner.
</P>
<P>
   ``Woman on Top''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: C+
</P>
<P>
   Starring Penelope Cruz and Murilo Benicio. Rated R for some
strong sexuality and language. 1 hour, 33 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: Tasty, but it won't fill you up.

   (UNDATED) The incessant ringing was bad enough, but when patrons
of the Whiteley Shopping Centre's cinema in London began answering
their cellular telephones mid-movie _ shouting to be heard above
the dialogue _ Nasser Ahmadi knew something had to give.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people were getting so angry that they were leaving the
cinema,'' said Ahmadi, a consultant to Universal Cinemas
International, which operates the multiscreen movie house. ``People
were asking why we didn't do something about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Across the globe, cell phones disturb plays, concerts and films.
Phones ring out during funerals and weddings. They bleep and buzz
in trains, restaurants and bathrooms. Cell-phone-free zones, polite
requests, even icy glares can't seem to stop the ringing and
consequent jabbering.
</P>
<P>
   But Ahmadi found something that does: a cellular telephone
jammer.
</P>
<P>
   Five months ago, he installed the C-Guard cellular telephone
firewall and complaints stopped. Made by an Israeli company called
NetLine, the C-Guard is one of a handful of cell phone jammers
commercially available today.
</P>
<P>
   But don't go looking for one at your neighborhood electronics
store.
</P>
<P>
   ``The technology is illegal in the U.S. and it's our position
that it should be,'' said Travis Larson, spokesman for the Cellular
Telephone Industry Association, based in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   Within their operating radius, jammers prevent wireless phones
from contacting a cellular radio tower. The affected phone behaves
as it would any place where reception is too poor to carry a call.
</P>
<P>
   Users ``don't complain because they don't know what's going
on,'' Ahmadi said. ``There are lots of places where there are
blackouts, anyway. They think it's the construction of the
building, so they come out in the foyer to make their phone
calls.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very Machiavellian but perfectly harmless,'' said
Jonathan Lemel, managing director for Special Electronic Security
Products, U.K. Ltd. of Manchester, England, which manufactures
jammers.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone agrees. The devices are banned in most
industrialized countries, which don't take kindly to disruption of
licensed radio services.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, spectrum is licensed by the FCC (Federal
Communications Commission) and purchased by broadcasters of all
kind to transmit information,'' said Larson, the cellular industry
spokesman. ``And those pieces of spectrum become the property of
those using them for the length of the licenses. So using a jammer
is analogous to taking someone else's property.''
</P>
<P>
   Gil Israeli, NetLine's CEO, counters that if anything's being
stolen, it's the peace and quiet of those of us forced to endure
loud cell phone conversations.
</P>
<P>
   Regulators have no beef with people installing expensive metal
shielding around rooms to block cell phone usage, Israeli observed.
``Our only argument with the FCC is whether people should be
allowed to defend their space actively as well as passively, using
an inexpensive device,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Richard DiSabatini, director of Intelligence Support Group,
Ltd., a jammer maker based in China Lake, Calif., agreed. ``This is
a whole gray area,'' he said. ``If you were in my home and I didn't
want you using your cell phone, why shouldn't I have the right to
block you?''
</P>
<P>
   DiSabatini's firm does not advertise its jammers. It sells them
only for export, to the military, or to those law enforcement
agencies exempted from FCC rules, he said.
</P>
<P>
   At its simplest, jamming any radio device involves transmitting
a signal on the same frequency and at high enough power that the
two signals collide and cancel each other out. The effect is
similar to what happens when you drop two pebbles in still water
and rings of waves radiate out from them. Where the rings meet, the
water becomes smooth.
</P>
<P>
   Cellular telephones, however, are more challenging to jam than
most radio transmissions. Different cellular systems operate over a
wide range of frequencies. Within those frequencies, any single
phone may ``spectrum hop'' to find a band free of interference.
Plus, phones can notch up their power to try to overcome
interference.
</P>
<P>
   Cell phone jammers have to be sophisticated enough to squelch
phone signals without interfering with other devices, from garage
door openers to medical equipment. In addition, they must operate
at power levels high enough to overcome cell phone signals, but not
so high that the jamming effect leaks outside the intended coverage
area.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, leakage is a key reason the FCC and other regulators
refuse to license jammers, Israeli said. But if governments set
specific rules for exactly how much leakage could be tolerated, he
said, NetLine could meet them.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't expect someone in an apartment complex not to use
his TV. We accept that some noise will come from our neighbors, but
we have some idea of what is a reasonable standard,'' Israeli said.
</P>
<P>
   To the cell phone industry, however, leakage isn't the only
problem. Larson noted that more than 118,000 emergency calls are
made each day from cell phones. And what if a doctor in a theater
misses an emergency call because of a jammer?
</P>
<P>
   Surreptitiously cutting off cellular telephone access is like
snipping off the burning tip of a cigarette because you object to
secondhand smoke, jammer foes say. ``The answer is etiquette,
education, making sure people are using their cell phones in ways
that don't invade other people's space,'' Larson said.
</P>
<P>
   Larson's association and many of its member companies, including
cell phone manufacturer Nokia and service provider U.S. Cellular,
are pouring money into public education campaigns to encourage cell
phone users to be more considerate.
</P>
<P>
   The FCC has fielded enough queries about the legality of cell
phone jammers that it issued a notice last year. In it, the agency
warns that jammers violate federal laws that broadly prohibit
interfering with licensed radio spectrum. Owning, manufacturing,
marketing, offering for sale or operating a cell phone jammer is
punishable by an $11,000 fine and up to a year in prison for each
offense, the notice states.
</P>
<P>
   Stern warnings to the contrary, the agency has never seized a
single jammer or prosecuted an operator to the best of his
knowledge, said Richard Welch, associate chief of the FCC's
Enforcement Bureau.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't taken any actions because nobody has complained,''
Welch said, adding that it was possible jammer users were simply
flying under the FCC's radar.
</P>
<P>
   Lemel agreed. When a cell phone doesn't work, he said, ``the
first thing you think isn't, `I'm being jammed.'''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (OPTIONAL TRIM FOLLOWS) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   It's not because they're not in use, if sales are any indicator.
Lemel says the United States is his firm's biggest market for cell
phone blockers. And NetLine, Israeli says, also sells many devices
in the States, though Europe is its largest market.
</P>
<P>
   Both companies sell liberally in Latin America, the Middle East
and Asia, where jammers are used for personal and corporate
security. For example, many South American banks jam cell phones to
prevent robbers from guiding outside accomplices to mug people
who've just made large withdrawals, Israeli said.
</P>
<P>
   Cell phone jammers are readily available on the Internet. Many
can be battery-powered and fit in a pocket or briefcase for people
who would like to enjoy a meal, movie or church service in peace.
</P>
<P>
   A portable C-Guard sells for about $900 and can cover the area
within a 450-foot radius. Lemel's company offers the $890 M2
Jammer, which comes in a briefcase and can block phones within a
maximum radius of 50 feet. It's advertised as ``ideal for the
executive interested in keeping meetings and working lunches free
from external distractions.'' Hubgiant of Taipei, Taiwan, sells its
WAC1000 personal jammer, which has an operating radius of up to 30
feet, for $169. And Uptron of Lucknow, India, offers a full range
of jammers with coverage ranging from 20 feet to over one mile.
</P>
<P>
   Despite cellular industry fears, the majority of jammer sales
aren't to revenge-seeking Luddites, Israeli said. Most go to
business owners, government and police. Law enforcement officers
can use jammers to throw a net of silence over hostage takers.
Corporations use jammers to protect trade secrets. Ahmadi said
three British hospitals evaluated the C-Guards in his theater
before installing them to prevent interference with crucial medical
equipment.
</P>
<P>
   At least one company offers a technological alternative to
jamming, and others are working on them.
</P>
<P>
   Zetron Inc., based in Redmond, Wash., manufactures a system that
can detect cell phones and warn users to turn them off. It can
cover up to a 90-foot radius. BlueLinx Inc. of Charlotte, N.C., is
working on Q-Zone, a system that will turn off cell phones or
silence their ringers when they enter a protected space. It relies
on shortwave technology called Bluetooth that hasn't been widely
adopted by cell phone makers and may not be on the market for
another three to four years. NetLine is developing a similar system
that will work with existing European digital cellular telephones,
but not American devices.
</P>
<P>
   In some countries, jammers are gaining currency as a legitimate
defense against cell phone abusers. In Japan, Tokyo-based Medic
Inc. sold thousands of its Wave Wall jammers to restaurants,
funeral directors and others before the government limited their
sale. Now jammers must be licensed for use in Japan, and used only
in spaces such as live-performance theaters where cell phones are
judged by the government to be a nuisance.
</P>
<P>
   But even that's a victory, says Israeli, who thinks such uses
help governments see that cell phone ``firewalls'' can serve a
legitimate market under controlled conditions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Legislators and government bodies have not yet realized that
(jammers) can fulfill a useful role in society,'' Lemel said. ``One
of these days, they'll wake up to it.''

``Our only argument with the FCC is whether people should be
allowed to defend their space actively as well as passively, using
an inexpensive device,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Richard DiSabatini, director of Intelligence Support Group,
Ltd., a jammer maker based in China Lake, Calif., agreed. ``This is
a whole gray area,'' he said. ``If you were in my home and I didn't
want you using your cell phone, why shouldn't I have the right to
block you?''
</P>
<P>
   DiSabatini's firm does not advertise its jammers. It sells them
only for export, to the military, or to those law enforcement
agencies exempted from FCC rules, he said.
</P>
<P>
   At its simplest, jamming any radio device involves transmitting
a signal on the same frequency and at high enough power that the
two signals collide and cancel each other out. The effect is
similar to what happens when you drop two pebbles in still water
and rings of waves radiate out from them. Where the rings meet, the
water becomes smooth.
</P>
<P>
   Cellular telephones, however, are more challenging to jam than
most radio transmissions. Different cellular systems operate over a
wide range of frequencies. Within those frequencies, any single
phone may ``spectrum hop'' to find a band free of interference.
Plus, phones can notch up their power to try to overcome
interference.
</P>
<P>
   Cell phone jammers have to be sophisticated enough to squelch
phone signals without interfering with other devices, from garage
door openers to medical equipment. In addition, they must operate
at power levels high enough to overcome cell phone signals, but not
so high that the jamming effect leaks outside the intended coverage
area.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, leakage is a key reason the FCC and other regulators
refuse to license jammers, Israeli said. But if governments set
specific rules for exactly how much leakage could be tolerated, he
said, NetLine could meet them.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't expect someone in an apartment complex not to use
his TV. We accept that some noise will come from our neighbors, but
we have some idea of what is a reasonable standard,'' Israeli said.
</P>
<P>
   To the cell phone industry, however, leakage isn't the only
problem. Larson noted that more than 118,000 emergency calls are
made each day from cell phones. And what if a doctor in a theater
misses an emergency call because of a jammer?
</P>
<P>
   Surreptitiously cutting off cellular telephone access is like
snipping off the burning tip of a cigarette because you object to
secondhand smoke, jammer foes say. ``The answer is etiquette,
education, making sure people are using their cell phones in ways
that don't invade other people's space,'' Larson said.
</P>
<P>
   Larson's association and many of its member companies, including
cell phone manufacturer Nokia and service provider U.S. Cellular,
are pouring money into public education campaigns to encourage cell
phone users to be more considerate.
</P>
<P>
   The FCC has fielded enough queries about the legality of cell
phone jammers that it issued a notice last year. In it, the agency
warns that jammers violate federal laws that broadly prohibit
interfering with licensed radio spectrum. Owning, manufacturing,
marketing, offering for sale or operating a cell phone jammer is
punishable by an $11,000 fine and up to a year in prison for each
offense, the notice states.
</P>
<P>
   Stern warnings to the contrary, the agency has never seized a
single jammer or prosecuted an operator to the best of his
knowledge, said Richard Welch, associate chief of the FCC's
Enforcement Bureau.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't taken any actions because nobody has complained,''
Welch said, adding that it was possible jammer users were simply
flying under the FCC's radar.
</P>
<P>
   Lemel agreed. When a cell phone doesn't work, he said, ``the
first thing you think isn't, `I'm being jammed.'''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (OPTIONAL TRIM FOLLOWS) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   It's not because they're not in use, if sales are any indicator.
Lemel says the United States is his firm's biggest market for cell
phone blockers. And NetLine, Israeli says, also sells many devices
in the States, though Europe is its largest market.
</P>
<P>
   Both companies sell liberally in Latin America, the Middle East
and Asia, where jammers are used for personal and corporate
security. For example, many South American banks jam cell phones to
prevent robbers from guiding outside accomplices to mug people
who've just made large withdrawals, Israeli said.
</P>
<P>
   Cell phone jammers are readily available on the Internet. Many
can be battery-powered and fit in a pocket or briefcase for people
who would like to enjoy a meal, movie or church service in peace.
</P>
<P>
   A portable C-Guard sells for about $900 and can cover the area
within a 450-foot radius. Lemel's company offers the $890 M2
Jammer, which comes in a briefcase and can block phones within a
maximum radius of 50 feet. It's advertised as ``ideal for the
executive interested in keeping meetings and working lunches free
from external distractions.'' Hubgiant of Taipei, Taiwan, sells its
WAC1000 personal jammer, which has an operating radius of up to 30
feet, for $169. And Uptron of Lucknow, India, offers a full range
of jammers with coverage ranging from 20 feet to over one mile.
</P>
<P>
   Despite cellular industry fears, the majority of jammer sales
aren't to revenge-seeking Luddites, Israeli said. Most go to
business owners, government and police. Law enforcement officers
can use jammers to throw a net of silence over hostage takers.
Corporations use jammers to protect trade secrets. Ahmadi said
three British hospitals evaluated the C-Guards in his theater
before installing them to prevent interference with crucial medical
equipment.
</P>
<P>
   At least one company offers a technological alternative to
jamming, and others are working on them.
</P>
<P>
   Zetron Inc., based in Redmond, Wash., manufactures a system that
can detect cell phones and warn users to turn them off. It can
cover up to a 90-foot radius. BlueLinx Inc. of Charlotte, N.C., is
working on Q-Zone, a system that will turn off cell phones or
silence their ringers when they enter a protected space. It relies
on shortwave technology called Bluetooth that hasn't been widely
adopted by cell phone makers and may not be on the market for
another three to four years. NetLine is developing a similar system
that will work with existing European digital cellular telephones,
but not American devices.
</P>
<P>
   In some countries, jammers are gaining currency as a legitimate
defense against cell phone abusers. In Japan, Tokyo-based Medic
Inc. sold thousands of its Wave Wall jammers to restaurants,
funeral directors and others before the government limited their
sale. Now jammers must be licensed for use in Japan, and used only
in spaces such as live-performance theaters where cell phones are
judged by the government to be a nuisance.
</P>
<P>
   But even that's a victory, says Israeli, who thinks such uses
help governments see that cell phone ``firewalls'' can serve a
legitimate market under controlled conditions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Legislators and government bodies have not yet realized that
(jammers) can fulfill a useful role in society,'' Lemel said. ``One
of these days, they'll wake up to it.''

   Ever sent an e-mail and regretted it? Your computer will soon be
able to warn you if your words are likely to offend. E-mail
``flaming'' is rife, but not all of it is intentional.
</P>
<P>
   ``Brief e-mails can be a bit more terse than intended,'' says
Helen Petrie, a psychologist at Hertfordshire University in
Hatfield. ``It's easy to be rude without meaning it.''
</P>
<P>
   This inspired Qualcomm of San Diego, California-maker of the
Eudora e-mail package to write software that seeks out wounding
words.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to stop people making a mistake they might
regret,'' explains technology chief Rob Chandhok.
</P>
<P>
   Qualcomm was aided by language expert David Kaufer, who studied
the alt.flames Usenet group, which has turned insults into an art
form.
</P>
<P>
   ``I read 400 flames and coded them for patterns in
phraseology,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   These codes let the software rank words and phrases that might
cause offense.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't look just look for profane words, because I can
say: 'Oh shit, I'm an idiot,' and it's not a flame at all,'' Kaufer
says.
</P>
<P>
   The new Moodwatch software is now part of Eudora. It gives
e-mails an offensiveness score by displaying between one and three
chili peppers on the screen, alongside an acerbic comment. &QL;

   A robot that can both walk and swim has been simulated in
California. Understanding the complex behavior involved in
switching from trotting to swimming could lead to a new generation
of amphibious robots, researchers say.
</P>
<P>
   Auke Ijspeert and Michael Arbib of the Brain Simulation
Laboratory at the University of Southern California in Los Angeles
wanted to investigate how behavior emerges from simple signals in a
creature's central nervous system. So they built a computer
simulation of a salamander's central nervous system, and
superimposed it on a computer animation.
</P>
<P>
   The resulting ``salamander'' exists in a simulated world of flat
ground and water. Gravity pulls it down, frictional forces act on
its feet as it walks, and swirling inertial forces affect it when
it is swimming.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being able to explore by crawling in and out of the sea is not
a trivial problem,'' says John Hallam of the artificial
intelligence department at the University of Edinburgh. ``There is
a tremendous niche market for amphibious robots which could be used
for navigation and exploration.''
</P>
<P>
   Moving from water to land, or vice versa, is a tough problem for
a robot, because it has to completely change its gait and adapt to
the new environment, without stopping. Robotic designers have
traditionally tried to solve this by breaking down the problem into
parts and solving them individually. But this approach is too
inflexible, Ijspeert says.
</P>
<P>
   Animals deal with this problem by using sensory inputs as
switches that turn different neural control mechanisms on or off.
These in turn are transformed into complex and coordinated
movements in the body. Through studying salamanders, Ijspeert and
Arbib were able to test various ideas about how different neural
mechanisms worked _ and see how vertebrates control their bodies.
</P>
<P>
   By copying natural oscillators in the brain that produce
rhythmic signals for various types of movement, the researchers
were able to produce quite complex behaviors.
</P>
<P>
   ``The circuits are capable of generating trotting and swimming
gaits,'' Ijspeert says.
</P>
<P>
   As the robot ``sees'' water approaching, or feels it, a series
of neurological switches make it change from the trotting
oscillator to the undulating swimming oscillator.
</P>
<P>
   According to Ijspeert, the salamander was an ideal choice
because it has many similarities with humans, but on a simpler
scale. ``It's a living fossil of one of the first vertebrates that
made the transition onto land,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   He believes his research will help us learn more about our own
control mechanisms. &QL;

   Ever since Sydney was awarded the Olympics six years ago, the
Australian government has been funding a program to screen children
for athletic prowess in particular sports. Children who make the
grade are offered formal training, even if they have no previous
experience in the sport identified.
</P>
<P>
   The Australian Institute of Sport in Canberra has used a
computer program to compare the physical attributes of candidates
with a database of attributes from a random cross-section of 6000
``nonsporting'' children. The computer selects exceptional ones and
matches them to a particular sport. The set of characteristics
required for success _ a long trunk in rowing, for instance _ is
gleaned from elite athletes.
</P>
<P>
   Besides using body measurements such as height, weight and arm
span, the software also logs sports-related skills.
</P>
<P>
   ``If little Jane has a vertical jump score on the 98th
percentile for her age and gender, the computer will highlight any
sport that emphasizes explosive leg power,'' says Chelsea Warr of
the Queensland Academy of Sport in Brisbane.
</P>
<P>
   To date, of the more than 200,000 children aged 3 to 6 years who
have been screened by the Talent Search program, around 1 percent
have been selected for training, producing 27 world junior
championship medals for Australia. While the program is not
particularly high-tech, sports physiologist Will Hopkins of the
University of Otago in New Zealand says, ``As long as you sample
enough kids even crude tests will work well.''
</P>
<P>
   But Dave Collins, a sports scientist at the University of
Edinburgh, says the test is of limited worth. Physical
characteristics give you a head start, he says.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it's the psychological characteristics that keep you in
the sport, keep you training and enable you to cope with the
pressure of competition. That makes you a champion.'' &QL;

<P>
   A mother's diet in the first few days after conception could
determine the health of her unborn child for life, British
researchers say.
</P>
<P>
   An embryo sets its growth rate according to its environment _ a
process known as programming. If a mother is malnourished, for
instance, the embryo grows more slowly, which leads to low
birthweight. Babies that are born small are more susceptible to
diabetes, high blood pressure and strokes in later life.
</P>
<P>
   Now a team led by Tom Fleming of the University of Southampton
suggests that programming may take place in the four or five days
following fertilization, before the embryo even implants in the
womb.
</P>
<P>
   After allowing female rats to mate, the researchers fed them a
low-protein diet for the following four and a quarter days _ the
window between fertilization and implantation. The rats ate a
normal diet for the rest of their pregnancies.
</P>
<P>
   The female pups of these mothers were born small, but then put
on an unusually fast growth spurt before settling down to a normal
weight. Males were born normal-sized, but had an abnormal pattern
of growth. They also had high blood pressure, shrunken livers and
enlarged kidneys.
</P>
<P>
   It's not clear why the defects occur. When the team took early
embryos from mother rats on the restricted diet and counted their
cells, they found that these embryos had fewer cells than expected
because they had gone through fewer divisions.
</P>
<P>
   One possible explanation is that an embryo's nutritional
environment affects how its genes are expressed. Fleming says the
findings could explain the abnormal development of sheep and cattle
grown from cloned embryos-so-called ``large offspring'' or ``dopey
calf'' syndrome.
</P>
<P>
   Ian Wilmut of the Roslin Institute near Edinburgh agrees that is
a possibility and says that human embryos could also be sensitive
to this effect.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of these observations should make people who are carrying
out IVF, and who are thinking of changing their protocols, think
more cautiously,'' Wilmut says. &QL;

   (UNDATED) The incessant ringing was bad enough, but when patrons
of the Whiteley Shopping Centre's cinema in London began answering
their cellular telephones mid-movie _ shouting to be heard above
the dialogue _ Nasser Ahmadi knew something had to give.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people were getting so angry that they were leaving the
cinema,'' said Ahmadi, a consultant to Universal Cinemas
International, which operates the multiscreen movie house. ``People
were asking why we didn't do something about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Across the globe, cell phones disturb plays, concerts and films.
Phones ring out during funerals and weddings. They bleep and buzz
in trains, restaurants and bathrooms. Cell-phone-free zones, polite
requests, even icy glares can't seem to stop the ringing and
consequent jabbering.
</P>
<P>
   But Ahmadi found something that does: a cellular telephone
jammer.
</P>
<P>
   Five months ago, he installed the C-Guard cellular telephone
firewall and complaints stopped. Made by an Israeli company called
NetLine, the C-Guard is one of a handful of cell phone jammers
commercially available today.
</P>
<P>
   But don't go looking for one at your neighborhood electronics
store.
</P>
<P>
   ``The technology is illegal in the U.S. and it's our position
that it should be,'' said Travis Larson, spokesman for the Cellular
Telephone Industry Association, based in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   Within their operating radius, jammers prevent wireless phones
from contacting a cellular radio tower. The affected phone behaves
as it would any place where reception is too poor to carry a call.
</P>
<P>
   Users ``don't complain because they don't know what's going
on,'' Ahmadi said. ``There are lots of places where there are
blackouts, anyway. They think it's the construction of the
building, so they come out in the foyer to make their phone
calls.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very Machiavellian but perfectly harmless,'' said
Jonathan Lemel, managing director for Special Electronic Security
Products, U.K. Ltd. of Manchester, England, which manufactures
jammers.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone agrees. The devices are banned in most
industrialized countries, which don't take kindly to disruption of
licensed radio services.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, spectrum is licensed by the FCC (Federal
Communications Commission) and purchased by broadcasters of all
kind to transmit information,'' said Larson, the cellular industry
spokesman. ``And those pieces of spectrum become the property of
those using them for the length of the licenses. So using a jammer
is analogous to taking someone else's property.''
</P>
<P>
   Gil Israeli, NetLine's CEO, counters that if anything's being
stolen, it's the peace and quiet of those of us forced to endure
loud cell phone conversations.
</P>
<P>
   Regulators have no beef with people installing expensive metal
shielding around rooms to block cell phone usage, Israeli observed.
``Our only argument with the FCC is whether people should be
allowed to defend their space actively as well as passively, using
an inexpensive device,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Richard DiSabatini, director of Intelligence Support Group,
Ltd., a jammer maker based in China Lake, Calif., agreed. ``This is
a whole gray area,'' he said. ``If you were in my home and I didn't
want you using your cell phone, why shouldn't I have the right to
block you?''
</P>
<P>
   DiSabatini's firm does not advertise its jammers. It sells them
only for export, to the military, or to those law enforcement
agencies exempted from FCC rules, he said.
</P>
<P>
   At its simplest, jamming any radio device involves transmitting
a signal on the same frequency and at high enough power that the
two signals collide and cancel each other out. The effect is
similar to what happens when you drop two pebbles in still water
and rings of waves radiate out from them. Where the rings meet, the
water becomes smooth.
</P>
<P>
   Cellular telephones, however, are more challenging to jam than
most radio transmissions. Different cellular systems operate over a
wide range of frequencies. Within those frequencies, any single
phone may ``spectrum hop'' to find a band free of interference.
Plus, phones can notch up their power to try to overcome
interference.
</P>
<P>
   Cell phone jammers have to be sophisticated enough to squelch
phone signals without interfering with other devices, from garage
door openers to medical equipment. In addition, they must operate
at power levels high enough to overcome cell phone signals, but not
so high that the jamming effect leaks outside the intended coverage
area.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, leakage is a key reason the FCC and other regulators
refuse to license jammers, Israeli said. But if governments set
specific rules for exactly how much leakage could be tolerated, he
said, NetLine could meet them.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't expect someone in an apartment complex not to use
his TV. We accept that some noise will come from our neighbors, but
we have some idea of what is a reasonable standard,'' Israeli said.
</P>
<P>
   To the cell phone industry, however, leakage isn't the only
problem. Larson noted that more than 118,000 emergency calls are
made each day from cell phones. And what if a doctor in a theater
misses an emergency call because of a jammer?
</P>
<P>
   Surreptitiously cutting off cellular telephone access is like
snipping off the burning tip of a cigarette because you object to
secondhand smoke, jammer foes say. ``The answer is etiquette,
education, making sure people are using their cell phones in ways
that don't invade other people's space,'' Larson said.
</P>
<P>
   Larson's association and many of its member companies, including
cell phone manufacturer Nokia and service provider U.S. Cellular,
are pouring money into public education campaigns to encourage cell
phone users to be more considerate.
</P>
<P>
   The FCC has fielded enough queries about the legality of cell
phone jammers that it issued a notice last year. In it, the agency
warns that jammers violate federal laws that broadly prohibit
interfering with licensed radio spectrum. Owning, manufacturing,
marketing, offering for sale or operating a cell phone jammer is
punishable by an $11,000 fine and up to a year in prison for each
offense, the notice states.
</P>
<P>
   Stern warnings to the contrary, the agency has never seized a
single jammer or prosecuted an operator to the best of his
knowledge, said Richard Welch, associate chief of the FCC's
Enforcement Bureau.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't taken any actions because nobody has complained,''
Welch said, adding that it was possible jammer users were simply
flying under the FCC's radar.
</P>
<P>
   Lemel agreed. When a cell phone doesn't work, he said, ``the
first thing you think isn't, `I'm being jammed.'''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (OPTIONAL TRIM FOLLOWS) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   It's not because they're not in use, if sales are any indicator.
Lemel says the United States is his firm's biggest market for cell
phone blockers. And NetLine, Israeli says, also sells many devices
in the States, though Europe is its largest market.
</P>
<P>
   Both companies sell liberally in Latin America, the Middle East
and Asia, where jammers are used for personal and corporate
security. For example, many South American banks jam cell phones to
prevent robbers from guiding outside accomplices to mug people
who've just made large withdrawals, Israeli said.
</P>
<P>
   Cell phone jammers are readily available on the Internet. Many
can be battery-powered and fit in a pocket or briefcase for people
who would like to enjoy a meal, movie or church service in peace.
</P>
<P>
   A portable C-Guard sells for about $900 and can cover the area
within a 450-foot radius. Lemel's company offers the $890 M2
Jammer, which comes in a briefcase and can block phones within a
maximum radius of 50 feet. It's advertised as ``ideal for the
executive interested in keeping meetings and working lunches free
from external distractions.'' Hubgiant of Taipei, Taiwan, sells its
WAC1000 personal jammer, which has an operating radius of up to 30
feet, for $169. And Uptron of Lucknow, India, offers a full range
of jammers with coverage ranging from 20 feet to over one mile.
</P>
<P>
   Despite cellular industry fears, the majority of jammer sales
aren't to revenge-seeking Luddites, Israeli said. Most go to
business owners, government and police. Law enforcement officers
can use jammers to throw a net of silence over hostage takers.
Corporations use jammers to protect trade secrets. Ahmadi said
three British hospitals evaluated the C-Guards in his theater
before installing them to prevent interference with crucial medical
equipment.
</P>
<P>
   At least one company offers a technological alternative to
jamming, and others are working on them.
</P>
<P>
   Zetron Inc., based in Redmond, Wash., manufactures a system that
can detect cell phones and warn users to turn them off. It can
cover up to a 90-foot radius. BlueLinx Inc. of Charlotte, N.C., is
working on Q-Zone, a system that will turn off cell phones or
silence their ringers when they enter a protected space. It relies
on shortwave technology called Bluetooth that hasn't been widely
adopted by cell phone makers and may not be on the market for
another three to four years. NetLine is developing a similar system
that will work with existing European digital cellular telephones,
but not American devices.
</P>
<P>
   In some countries, jammers are gaining currency as a legitimate
defense against cell phone abusers. In Japan, Tokyo-based Medic
Inc. sold thousands of its Wave Wall jammers to restaurants,
funeral directors and others before the government limited their
sale. Now jammers must be licensed for use in Japan, and used only
in spaces such as live-performance theaters where cell phones are
judged by the government to be a nuisance.
</P>
<P>
   But even that's a victory, says Israeli, who thinks such uses
help governments see that cell phone ``firewalls'' can serve a
legitimate market under controlled conditions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Legislators and government bodies have not yet realized that
(jammers) can fulfill a useful role in society,'' Lemel said. ``One
of these days, they'll wake up to it.''

   Ever sent an e-mail and regretted it? Your computer will soon be
able to warn you if your words are likely to offend. E-mail
``flaming'' is rife, but not all of it is intentional.
</P>
<P>
   ``Brief e-mails can be a bit more terse than intended,'' says
Helen Petrie, a psychologist at Hertfordshire University in
Hatfield. ``It's easy to be rude without meaning it.''
</P>
<P>
   This inspired Qualcomm of San Diego, California-maker of the
Eudora e-mail package to write software that seeks out wounding
words.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to stop people making a mistake they might
regret,'' explains technology chief Rob Chandhok.
</P>
<P>
   Qualcomm was aided by language expert David Kaufer, who studied
the alt.flames Usenet group, which has turned insults into an art
form.
</P>
<P>
   ``I read 400 flames and coded them for patterns in
phraseology,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   These codes let the software rank words and phrases that might
cause offense.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't look just look for profane words, because I can
say: 'Oh shit, I'm an idiot,' and it's not a flame at all,'' Kaufer
says.
</P>
<P>
   The new Moodwatch software is now part of Eudora. It gives
e-mails an offensiveness score by displaying between one and three
chili peppers on the screen, alongside an acerbic comment. &QL;

   A robot that can both walk and swim has been simulated in
California. Understanding the complex behavior involved in
switching from trotting to swimming could lead to a new generation
of amphibious robots, researchers say.
</P>
<P>
   Auke Ijspeert and Michael Arbib of the Brain Simulation
Laboratory at the University of Southern California in Los Angeles
wanted to investigate how behavior emerges from simple signals in a
creature's central nervous system. So they built a computer
simulation of a salamander's central nervous system, and
superimposed it on a computer animation.
</P>
<P>
   The resulting ``salamander'' exists in a simulated world of flat
ground and water. Gravity pulls it down, frictional forces act on
its feet as it walks, and swirling inertial forces affect it when
it is swimming.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being able to explore by crawling in and out of the sea is not
a trivial problem,'' says John Hallam of the artificial
intelligence department at the University of Edinburgh. ``There is
a tremendous niche market for amphibious robots which could be used
for navigation and exploration.''
</P>
<P>
   Moving from water to land, or vice versa, is a tough problem for
a robot, because it has to completely change its gait and adapt to
the new environment, without stopping. Robotic designers have
traditionally tried to solve this by breaking down the problem into
parts and solving them individually. But this approach is too
inflexible, Ijspeert says.
</P>
<P>
   Animals deal with this problem by using sensory inputs as
switches that turn different neural control mechanisms on or off.
These in turn are transformed into complex and coordinated
movements in the body. Through studying salamanders, Ijspeert and
Arbib were able to test various ideas about how different neural
mechanisms worked _ and see how vertebrates control their bodies.
</P>
<P>
   By copying natural oscillators in the brain that produce
rhythmic signals for various types of movement, the researchers
were able to produce quite complex behaviors.
</P>
<P>
   ``The circuits are capable of generating trotting and swimming
gaits,'' Ijspeert says.
</P>
<P>
   As the robot ``sees'' water approaching, or feels it, a series
of neurological switches make it change from the trotting
oscillator to the undulating swimming oscillator.
</P>
<P>
   According to Ijspeert, the salamander was an ideal choice
because it has many similarities with humans, but on a simpler
scale. ``It's a living fossil of one of the first vertebrates that
made the transition onto land,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   He believes his research will help us learn more about our own
control mechanisms. &QL;

   Ever since Sydney was awarded the Olympics six years ago, the
Australian government has been funding a program to screen children
for athletic prowess in particular sports. Children who make the
grade are offered formal training, even if they have no previous
experience in the sport identified.
</P>
<P>
   The Australian Institute of Sport in Canberra has used a
computer program to compare the physical attributes of candidates
with a database of attributes from a random cross-section of 6000
``nonsporting'' children. The computer selects exceptional ones and
matches them to a particular sport. The set of characteristics
required for success _ a long trunk in rowing, for instance _ is
gleaned from elite athletes.
</P>
<P>
   Besides using body measurements such as height, weight and arm
span, the software also logs sports-related skills.
</P>
<P>
   ``If little Jane has a vertical jump score on the 98th
percentile for her age and gender, the computer will highlight any
sport that emphasizes explosive leg power,'' says Chelsea Warr of
the Queensland Academy of Sport in Brisbane.
</P>
<P>
   To date, of the more than 200,000 children aged 3 to 6 years who
have been screened by the Talent Search program, around 1 percent
have been selected for training, producing 27 world junior
championship medals for Australia. While the program is not
particularly high-tech, sports physiologist Will Hopkins of the
University of Otago in New Zealand says, ``As long as you sample
enough kids even crude tests will work well.''
</P>
<P>
   But Dave Collins, a sports scientist at the University of
Edinburgh, says the test is of limited worth. Physical
characteristics give you a head start, he says.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it's the psychological characteristics that keep you in
the sport, keep you training and enable you to cope with the
pressure of competition. That makes you a champion.'' &QL;

   A mother's diet in the first few days after conception could
determine the health of her unborn child for life, British
researchers say.
</P>
<P>
   An embryo sets its growth rate according to its environment _ a
process known as programming. If a mother is malnourished, for
instance, the embryo grows more slowly, which leads to low
birthweight. Babies that are born small are more susceptible to
diabetes, high blood pressure and strokes in later life.
</P>
<P>
   Now a team led by Tom Fleming of the University of Southampton
suggests that programming may take place in the four or five days
following fertilization, before the embryo even implants in the
womb.
</P>
<P>
   After allowing female rats to mate, the researchers fed them a
low-protein diet for the following four and a quarter days _ the
window between fertilization and implantation. The rats ate a
normal diet for the rest of their pregnancies.
</P>
<P>
   The female pups of these mothers were born small, but then put
on an unusually fast growth spurt before settling down to a normal
weight. Males were born normal-sized, but had an abnormal pattern
of growth. They also had high blood pressure, shrunken livers and
enlarged kidneys.
</P>
<P>
   It's not clear why the defects occur. When the team took early
embryos from mother rats on the restricted diet and counted their
cells, they found that these embryos had fewer cells than expected
because they had gone through fewer divisions.
</P>
<P>
   One possible explanation is that an embryo's nutritional
environment affects how its genes are expressed. Fleming says the
findings could explain the abnormal development of sheep and cattle
grown from cloned embryos-so-called ``large offspring'' or ``dopey
calf'' syndrome.
</P>
<P>
   Ian Wilmut of the Roslin Institute near Edinburgh agrees that is
a possibility and says that human embryos could also be sensitive
to this effect.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of these observations should make people who are carrying
out IVF, and who are thinking of changing their protocols, think
more cautiously,'' Wilmut says. &QL;

hailed as the pharmacological equivalent of a Satanic pact. Buckets
of traditional and experimental under-the-counter
performance-enhancing drugs will be ingested by competitors who
then go out and set world-records in all the traditional Olympic
events, after which they immediately drop dead. (Horses not
eligible.)
</P>
<P>
   2 x 4 Men's and Women's Canada Mock _ Athletes from all nations
beat up on Canada for no reason other than it's fun. The gold medal
will be awarded to the competitor who uses the words ``aboot'' and
``eh'' most often in a minute-long speech. Moose, hockey and
stocking-cap jokes are encouraged.
</P>
<P>
   20mb Reboot _ There is no starting gun in this event; instead, a
message appears on each competitor's computer screen that reads:
``You have performed an illegal operation and will be shut down.''
Then it's a race to see who can be the first to complete a
long-distance, toll-not-remotely-free call to tech services for a
solution to the problem that does not involve witchcraft or the
purchase of a new computer. Note to competitors: Smashing your
computer to smithereens with a baseball bat does not qualify as a
successful reboot, satisfying as it may be.
</P>
<P>
   8mm Drive-By Shooting _ Competitors drive around the
neighborhood and shoot at things. Gold medal goes to shooter who
avoids the most prison time due to the fact he had an unhappy
childhood.
</P>
<P>
   Greco-Roman Remote-Control Wrestling _ Married couples wrestle
each other for control of the clicker dude. Award 10 points if she
has to sit through 15 minutes of an NFL pre-game show; 20 points if
he has to sit through an entire episode of Martha Stewart Living; 5
points deducted if the clicker gets lost under the sofa and both
have to watch Teletubbies with their children.
</P>
<P>
   Synchronized Pronunciation _ Competitors get to find out if
they're presidential material by repeating the words
``subliminable,'' ``tacular'' and ``hole'' 20 times fast. Gold
medal winner gets to destroy Medicare or Social Security, whichever
he or she prefers.
</P>
<P>
   Australian Rules Childproof Unpackaging _ Players compete
against each other to see who can open a bottle of aspirin first.
Since the game is played under Australian rules, competitors can
kick, punch or gouge the aspirin bottles without incurring a
penalty. Firearms are prohibited, except in case of a tiebreaker.
</P>
<P>
   20cc Cell-Phone Chat _ Competitors are awarded medals according
to how many people they annoy with their cellular phones. Contests
will be held in a variety of venues, including a restaurant, a
movie theater, a doctor's office and a church. Note: Contestants
may not switch phones during the competition unless their original
phone is yanked from their grasp by an irate diner/movie
patron/patient/congregant and stomped into dust.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Today
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Sabrina the Teenage Witch'' (8 p.m. on the WB, 298498) _
Melissa Joan Hart has been trying to sex up her image by posing
provocatively for Maxim or Details or one of those can't-tell-'em
apart men's mags. But where Britney Spears makes that come-hither
thing seem as natural as breathing, it seems forced for Hart, who's
had a TV-sweetheart image since her days as Clarissa on
Nickelodeon.
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, ABC decided that ``Sabrina'' had run its course after
four seasons, but the WB picked it up and is starting new episodes
tonight, in which Hart will be fully clothed. She's now a college
freshman; Soleil Moon Frye plays her roommate.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Complete History of the Navy SEALs'' (9 p.m. on The History
Channel, 2066946) _ They better have Rudy. If not, check him out at
9 on CBS on the ``Survivor'' repeats.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Sweet Revenge'' (8 p.m. on Showtime, 203328) _ A dandy cast
and pedigree, but the buzz isn't great on this movie, which was
made as a 1998 theatrical, never released, and now goes straight to
cable. Sam Neill, Helena Bonham Carter and Kristin Scott Thomas
star in an adaptation of an Alan Ayckbourn play about payback.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Debating Our Destiny _ 40 Years of Presidential Debates'' (9
p.m. on GPTV, 72908) _ Jim Lehrer, who will be the moderator at all
three scheduled presidential debates in October, looks back at the
four decades of televised debates that began in 1960 with
Kennedy-Nixon. Interviews (some done for the show, some from file
footage) about performance and style vs. substance include Jimmy
Carter, Ronald Reagan, Dan Quayle, Geraldine Ferraro, Bill Clinton
and Gerald Ford.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Behind the Music Fourth Anniversary Special'' (9 p.m. on
VH1, 807989) _ VH1's addictive little docu-series tends to follow
the same path _ early success, drugs and/or egos, bottoming out,
comeback _ but it's a formula that works. This 90-minute special
features guests Leif Garrett, Rick Springfield, Fabrice Morvan (of
Milli Vannili) and Motley Crue, with a performance by the Bangles,
who, not coincidentally, have reunited for a tour.
</P>
<P>
   The New Season
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Grosse Point'' (8:30 p.m. Friday on the WB, 529545)
</P>
<P>
   Now poking its pouty lips and beady eyes over the horizon is the
second new series of the fall season, ``Grosse Point,'' a pointed
behind-the-scenes satire of teen soaps like ``Beverly Hills,
90210'' and ``Dawson's Creek.''
</P>
<P>
   Just how pointed was hammered home this summer, when former
``90210'' star Tori Spelling got a look at the pilot. Specifically
Marcy, an insecure actress with an eating disorder and multiple
plastic surgeries, whose father got her an acting job on ``Grosse
Point,'' the show-within-a-show. (The show is a comedy, making fun
of a fake drama, so you have to pay attention. A little.)
</P>
<P>
   Tori went to daddy Aaron Spelling, who went to the WB, and they
toned the character down, slightly, so it wasn't so obviously Tori.
But Marcy is still obviously Tori, just as Hunter is a dead ringer
for Shannen Doherty, both in looks and (mis)demeanor.
</P>
<P>
   And who's loosing this libel? None other than Darren Star,
former Spelling protege, former producer of ``90210'' and creator
of ``Melrose Place'' and ``Sex and the City.'' He also gets in his
digs against Luke Perry (here named Quentin, an aging actor playing
a high school kid even though he's balding) and Jason Priestley
(Johnny, a dim boy who's in it for the sex).
</P>
<P>
   ``Grosse Pointe'' has some wickedness to it. ``How are you going
to handle a baby? You couldn't even handle the 11th grade!'' is a
typical line of dialogue on the faux drama. But it really works
best if you followed the gossip columns five to 10 years ago, when
``90210'' was all that. And that probably doesn't apply to the
young WB audience that will be watching and that will vote ``GP''
up or down in the ratings without knowing, or caring, who's zoomin'
whom. Grade: B-

&HT;     LAST B-52 LEAVES TEXAS BASE 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By SIG CHRISTENSON  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ The last of the mighty B-52 bombers at Kelly Air
Force Base has been packed up and shipped to Oklahoma.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of sad to look at because everything's being moved
out,'' retired Army 1st Sgt. Henry Cortez said as he and his wife,
Alice, saw the B-52 roll past the Jet Engine Test Cells Building at
Kelly.
</P>
<P>
   The wings of the behemoth bomber were loaded onto one
18-wheeler, and its 159-foot-4-inch-long fuselage was cradled on
the trailer of another truck.
</P>
<P>
   A fixture at Kelly since 1984, the B-52 left the base Wednesday
for a three-day trip to Tinker Air Force Base in Oklahoma City,
where it will be used to provide training for the 654th Combat
Logistics Squadron.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly is scheduled to close June 13, 2001.
</P>
<P>
   The base, once the city's biggest employer with 25,000 military
and civilian workers and a $721 million payroll, is down to about
1,800 civil-service workers. Kelly will lay off 76 workers
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Next year, the 4,600-acre installation and its 593 buildings
will become KellyUSA, a city-run industrial park.
</P>
<P>
   The base's primary function, the repair and maintenance of
planes, has ended, with gas turbine engine work shifting to Tinker
and Hill Air Force Base in Utah.
</P>
<P>
   Those remaining at Kelly now perform such tasks as shipping
equipment and preparing the installation for private development.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just another sign of the transition from Air Force base
to industrial park,'' San Antonio Mayor Howard Peak said.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a passing of the guard, isn't it?'' said Bob Bomer, a
member of the Greater Kelly Development Authority board, which is
in charge of the base transition. ``The last of the B-52s are gone
from Kelly. That was their home for many years.''
</P>
<P>
   Like the fabled C-5 Galaxy, the B-52 for many symbolizes the
rise of the 83-year-old base and its profound contributions to the
city.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly welcomed its first B-52 in August 1956. The base was a
repair hub for the Stratofortress through much of the Vietnam War,
Kelly spokesman Warren Domke said.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly continued to perform maintenance on B-52s until the early
1990s, when Tinker took over the job as the fleet thinned out, he
said, noting that ``an entire generation of workers'' serviced the
jet bomber.
</P>
<P>
   Retired Air Force Master Sgt. George Carodeau, a B-52 tailgunner
in 1957 and 1958, thought about his days in uniform as the plane
passed Little Joe's Ice House. As he popped open a beer, Carodeau,
73, took stock of the event, seeing it as the end of an era for
Kelly and the B-52.
</P>
<P>
   ``You hate to see the passing,'' he said, ``of a good old
bird.''

`STEAL THIS' WON'T START ANY RIOTS, BUT IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO DISLIKE
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 By CHRISTOPHER KELLY 
 c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The life of the late radical protester Abbie Hoffman would seem
tailor-made for the movies. He found his voice in the anti-Vietnam
War protests of the 1960s, and at the 1968 Democratic National
Convention became a household name for disrupting the convention as
the ringleader of the infamous ``Chicago Seven.''
</P>
<P>
   In the following years, he was tossed into jail (for the Chicago
incident), let out on appeal, tailed relentlessly by the FBI and
eventually forced underground after being caught with enough drugs
to keep him in prison for life.
</P>
<P>
   Miscast, often misguided and far too in love with its subject,
Robert Greenwald's ``Steal This Movie,'' with the title itself
stolen from Hoffman's notorious memoir ``Steal This Book,'' isn't
the movie it could have been. It certainly isn't the movie that
Hoffman _ a tough-minded, unyielding man who demanded adherence to
the highest moral and political standards from both his government
and his fellow citizens _ deserved. But it's made with real
intelligence and heart, and if it never quite comes together, it's
also impossible to dismiss.
</P>
<P>
   Hoffman is played by Vincent D'Onofrio (''The Whole Wide
World,'' ``The Cell''), an actor whose Method-y affectations I've
always found distracting. D'Onofrio has fun wiggling his body
around in hippie protest and capturing Hoffman's
Brooklyn-cum-Boston accent. His showy performance is all surface,
though; he never comes close to getting at the demons that
ultimately tore Hoffman apart (he committed suicide in 1989). Even
more perplexing is Janeane Garofalo, playing Hoffman's wife, Anita.
When Garofalo has the right material _ when her hipster irony can
comingle with vulnerability and tenderness, as in ``The Truth About
Cats and Dogs'' _ she's a lovely, assured presence. But here she
not only looks out of place (Couldn't they at least have given her
a '60s hairstyle?), she also seems wholly uncomfortable with the
earnestness that the doting-wife role demands.
</P>
<P>
   There are others things, too, that I could have done without:
Director Robert Greenwald adopts a ``Citizen Kane''-style approach,
as a journalist (David Glenn) pieces together Hoffman's story for a
magazine article. But the device doesn't mesh with the material in
any meaningful way. The film also never completely addresses
Hoffman's megalomania and paranoia. At one point, he rants about
how he personally put an end to the Vietnam War, and that the
government is determined to bring him down because of that. But I'm
not sure if we're supposed to take this straight _ or see Hoffman's
hubris as his Achilles' heel.
</P>
<P>
   And yet every time you want to write the movie off, it delivers
a sequence or an idea that's entirely arresting. The Chicago Seven
trial is a wonderfully edited comedy of misbehavior that recalls
Milos Forman's rollicking ``The People Vs. Larry Flynt''; and while
I know better than to be affected by the hoary device of having
Hoffman _ while delivering closing arguments during a later civil
disobediance trial _ turn to the camera and call upon the audience
to fight for their political beliefs, I still found it touching.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, though, you long for something more mutlifaceted and
complete _ perhaps even a documentary account of Hoffman's life.
You wish, too, that Greenwald could have seen Hoffman's life in a
broader context _ the way, say, Forman saw Larry Flynt's. Still,
you can hardly begrudge the ambition on display _ and you find
yourself grateful that someone has at least made an attempt to
understand Hoffman's conflicted, elusive essence.

<P>
   Director William Friedkin's benchmark 1973 horror classic draws
a line in the sand no filmmaker has yet dared to cross.
</P>
<P>
   As unnervingly shocking as it was when it was released more than
a quarter-century ago, Friedkin's adaptation of William Peter
Blatty's bestselling novel (and Oscar-winning screenplay) about
Regan MacNeil (Linda Blair), a 12-year-old girl possessed by the
devil, still has the power to unhinge even today's most jaded
moviegoer.
</P>
<P>
   Some chalk it up to Friedkin's envelope-pushing gore effects and
Regan's more blasphemous shenanigans, but there's a more powerful
undercurrent of dread running through ``The Exorcist'' that reaches
beyond the now legendary shock tactics.
</P>
<P>
   Ellen Burstyn's Chris MacNeil is a loving, single-mom movie star
driven to the brink after watching her vivacious little girl
transform into a violent, gutter-mouthed, projectile-vomiting
creature.
</P>
<P>
   Max von Sydow and Jason Miller are Catholic priests called in to
exorcise the demon after all medical curative attempts are
exhausted.
</P>
<P>
   Dick Smith and Rick Baker's unforgettable makeup effects and
Mike Oldfield's ``Tubular Bells'' on the soundtrack are what most
folks remember, but a crisp, clean new print, completely redesigned
sound and 11 minutes of additional footage are the showcases of
``The Version You've Never Seen.''
</P>
<P>
   The new sound alone is worth the trip _ Regan's possessed
ramblings (most of which were voiced by actress Mercedes
McCambridge) are even more chilling. Most of the extra footage is
inserted in the film's prologue in Iraq and at the conclusion, with
a few additional bits here and there that only diehard fans would
pick up. One additional clip, featuring Regan making a rare,
post-possession departure from her bedroom, offers a delightfully
horrifying surprise.
</P>
<P>
   Despite some unintentionally funny moments _ Regan's doctor
lighting up a cigarette while telling her mother that the problem
is not her daughter's bed, ``it's her brain'' _ notwithstanding,
it's the more emotionally disturbing elements of ``The Exorcist''
that still pack a punch. Burstyn watching helplessly as her
daughter undergoes painful, archaic medical procedures and Miller's
crisis of faith after the death of his mother still affect
audiences as much as watching Regan's head spin around.
</P>
<P>
   Which is why ``The Exorcist'' will continue to challenge and
terrify long after the ``Screams'' have died out.

<P>
   (UNDATED) The early prognosis was grim when Phyllis DeAngelis
was diagnosed with lung cancer six years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The Brick Township, N.J., resident had a Stage 3 tumor the size
of a grapefruit wrapped around her jugular vein, and doctors gave
her just months to live.
</P>
<P>
   So DeAngelis, now 62, decided to participate in an experimental
cancer drug trial at Fox Chase Cancer Center in Philadelphia, where
she was given a combination of Taxol and Cisplatin. ``Taxol had
been used for other cancers, but not for lung,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Before entering the trial, DeAngelis underwent seven weeks of
radiation treatment to stop the tumor's growth. After the treatment
ended, there was more bad news: a lump in her neck _ proof the
disease had spread to her lymph nodes.
</P>
<P>
   By the time she entered the trial, doctors at Fox Chase thought
the experimental drugs would prolong her life for only a month _
maybe two.
</P>
<P>
   Phyllis DeAngelis is happy to say she's still here and has been
cancer-free for 51/2 years. ``I'm very blessed,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   DeAngelis' story is an example of what is slowly changing from a
rarity to common practice: women involved in clinical trials.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, DeAngelis was the only woman involved in the
Taxol/Cisplatin drug trial, and was one of its few successes. Lung
cancer patients now receive treatments based in part on the
conclusions drawn from that trial.
</P>
<P>
   Women's participation in medical research and clinical trials
was infrequent for the first 20 years or so of modern research.
However, in the seven years since federal law has required women's
inclusion in studies, their numbers have increased.
</P>
<P>
   Women initially were excluded from much of the research because,
among other reasons, they presented too many biological variables _
such as risk of pregnancy.
</P>
<P>
   Legislation that would have required inclusion of women and
minorities in studies was introduced in Congress in 1990. But it
wasn't until three years later that President Clinton signed a bill
mandating that research funded by the National Institutes of Health
include men and women.
</P>
<P>
   Statistics from 1998 (the latest year available) show that more
than 65 percent of participants in NIH studies were women. Of 6,947
studies supported by NIH that year, 6,000 included men and women.
Fewer than 250 studies were designed for men only, and about 740
studies were limited to women.
</P>
<P>
   Ray Woosley, head of the pharmacology department at Georgetown
University and a director of clinical research, said anecdotal
evidence shows that women are affected by drugs differently than
men. For example, women have different drug sensitivities depending
on which phase of their menstrual cycle they are in. Seldane, an
allergy drug, and Propulsid, a drug for gastrointestinal
complaints, were taken off the market because of adverse side
effects like heart arrhythmia. The majority of those reporting the
adverse effects were women.
</P>
<P>
   ``Women are more variable than men,'' Woosley said. ``The more
variability you have in a study, the more difficult it is to prove
your premise. By picking all male rats for a study, you filter down
to a very homogeneous group. You throw in female rats, you have to
do twice as much work.''
</P>
<P>
   For a long time, Woosley said, a lot of clinical trials were
conducted in Veterans Administration hospitals because the
population was easy to monitor and accessible. If you look at
mixed-gender trials for congestive heart failure, women are still
underrepresented.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're doing better, but there is still more to be done,''
Woosley said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinical trials can be tests of new medications. They also can
involve lifestyle changes and behavior modification to see if those
changes can reduce the risks of certain conditions and diseases,
such as diabetes and osteoporosis.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Woosley's findings, there is other evidence that
women have different reactions to drugs than men. Antihistamines,
antibiotics and pain medications cause different reactions and side
effects in men and women. One study found that the class of
painkillers called kappa opioids _ all but ignored because they
showed few benefits in men _ are quite effective in women. The same
is true of a new drug for irritable bowel syndrome, Lotronex, which
has been very effective in women although there have been reports
of serious side effects.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a long time, women were pretty much excluded from trials
because their participation would change the results,'' said
Sebastian Palmeri, associate professor of medicine and medical

   ``You never wanted women of child-bearing age in a trial because
there could be some unknown risk for future pregnancies. Also,
women who were older and more at risk for heart attack were
perceived as being more fragile,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the last 10 years, if you put together a proposal for NIH
funding, you have to say it's open to all genders and ethnic
groups. If not, you have to explain why. This gives you good cause
to approach patients young and old, male and female, and of all
ethnic groups. But some studies are still weighted
disproportionately to middle-aged white males.''
</P>
<P>
   However, there are some important gender-specific studies being
conducted today. There is a large national trial involving 161,000
women to determine the effects of calcium supplements and hormone
replacement on postmenopausal women. About 900 women also are being
studied for a type of heart disease.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (OPTIONAL TRIM FOLLOWS) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   After heart disease, stroke and lung cancer and other lung
conditions, such as emphysema, are the leading causes of death for
women. But breast cancer, which is the cause of death for only 4
percent of women in the United States, has a much higher profile.
</P>
<P>
   ``Breast cancer kills 4 percent of women, but all the research
and outreach has made it more noticeable than heart disease, which
is the leading killer of women,'' said Phyllis Greenberger,
executive director of the Society for Women's Health Research. ``We
don't want to take away from those efforts, but people need to
change their thinking.''
</P>
<P>
   The Society for Women's Health Research has been promoting
women's participation in health research since 1990. It has a Web
site, www.womancando.org, which is a clearinghouse for research and
trial information.
</P>
<P>
   Palmeri said the increased participation of women in medical
research is a step in the right direction.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only way we move forward is by making tiny steps in the
right direction,'' he said. ``Clinical trials not only have
potential benefits for the population now, but also for their
friends, children and grandchildren. If clinical trials include
regular analysis of gender and ethnicity, they will become much
more sophisticated and much more expansive. As a consequence, the
rewards will be much greater.''

`THE FANTASTICKS': YOUNG LOVEBIRDS FLY ON THE SHEEREST OF GOSSAMER
WINGS 
</HEADLINE>
  (Production notes at end of review) 
 By A.O. SCOTT    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Perhaps `The Fantasticks' is by nature the sort of thing that
loses magic the longer it endures,'' Brooks Atkinson wrote in The
New York Times more than 40 years ago. Of course Atkinson meant
simply that this two-act musical trifle went on for too long to
sustain its air of lighthearted romanticism. But the New York stage
production of ``The Fantasticks'' has endured for something like a
geologic age; next to it, even the extinct ``Cats'' occupies but a
whisker's breadth on the timeline.
</P>
<P>
   And now, at long last, there is a movie version, directed by
Michael Ritchie and released after languishing on dusty studio
shelves for five years. As a film ``The Fantasticks'' wobbles
between the timeless and the anachronistic. For all its robust good
cheer it's a timid and uncertain creature, a mewing kitten
wandering out into the world in search of a big-hearted 11-year-old
girl to tie ribbons around its ears and give it a bowl of warm
milk.
</P>
<P>
   The story is woven of thinnest gossamer. Two adorable ingenues,
male and female (Joe McIntyre and Jean Louisa Kelly, both of them
lovely and hard-working), live side by side in clapboard farmhouses
built on the edge of a glorious painted backdrop. Their fathers
(Joel Grey and Brad Sullivan) pretend to feud, on the theory that
parental opposition is the surest way to bring their youngsters
together. To bring their plan to fruition, the dads hire the cast
of a traveling carnival, led by a suave magician called El Gallo
(Jonathon Morris), to abduct young Louisa so that Matt can rescue
her and win her heart. Though the plan works, the lovebirds soon
become disillusioned with each other, and the second act (about
which Atkinson complained) follows them into temptation, through
the loss of innocence that is a necessary condition for real love.
</P>
<P>
   It's all done in good fun and without pretensions. Nobody would
enlist ``The Fantasticks'' in the canon of great musicals. Lyrics
like ``what at night seems so scenic, may seem cynic by and by''
are not exactly Gershwin _ they're not exactly English, come to
think of it. But the songs have a fresh-faced precocity, a
40-year-old precocity, to be sure, and the closing number, ``Try to
Remember,'' has some claim to minor classic status.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, what looks like magic on stage can seem manic by
the light of the screen. Live theater can tolerate outsize
gestures, rickety sets and willful illusionism more easily than
film, which is a stubbornly literal-minded medium. Grey and
Sullivan, mugging and swinging their arms to reach the cheap seats,
look a little foolish in close-up on the big screen, as does
Morris, who has the flowing tresses and rolling diction of a
touring-company veteran.
</P>
<P>
   The musical numbers are bizarrely edited: In her first big song,
Kelly strolls down a rural lane, cavorts under a tree and reveals
her longing for a bit of worldliness to a sympathetic cow. The
haphazard cutting wrecks the moment with self-consciousness, a
problem that persists through the long fantasy sequence in the
middle of the movie. It is only overcome in the final duet, during
which the camera stands back and lets the lovebirds belt out their
feelings against a Technicolor sky.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Fantasticks'' is, at bottom, a tribute to the
transformative power of theater, and the theater is where it should
have been allowed to remain. The movie version overflows with
affection and good intention, but unwittingly turns a bauble of
cheerful fakery into something that mostly feels phony.

   OLY-ABORIGINES _ SYDNEY _ We have written for a week about the
utter beauty of the 2000 Olympic city, with its dramatic skyline
and opulent opera house and exquisite harbors. We have waxed
breathlessly about the wonder of the place. Time for a reality
check. Lost amid the unabashed display of wealth and growth in this

   OLY-ARCH-ABORIGINES _ SYDNEY _ A column on Aborigines, their
story, life, &AMP; protest. Aboriginal leaders have warned of violent
protests at the Sydney Olympics because of a government report that
plays down the harm caused by a longtime policy of taking
Aboriginal children from their families. For months, Aboriginal
protesters have said they would use the Sept. 15-Oct. 1 Olympics
and the intense media attention the games generate to highlight the
plight of their people. The previously conciliatory mood evaporated
recently following revelations that the government believes
accounts of the estimated 100,000 Aboriginal children taken by
authorities between 1910 and the 1970s - known as the stolen
generation'' - were exaggerated. Column will focus on Cathy

family in the Aquatic Center crowd, the most decorated female
athlete in U.S. Olympic history wondered just what she was supposed
to do with a bronze medal from the final individual event of her

`WOMAN ON TOP': A PASSION FOR FOOD AND OTHER DELICACIES 
</HEADLINE>
  (Production notes at end of review) 
 By ELVIS MITCHELL    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The soothing lilt of bossa nova floats over the malnourished but
sometimes entrancing romantic comedy ``Woman on Top,'' which starts
in Bahia, where the delectable Penelope Cruz plays Isabella, a
chef. Isabella cooks magnificent meals, and epicures from around
the globe fall in love with her culinary talents. In the dining
room of the restaurant her husband, Toninho (Murilo Benicio), the
restaurant's owner, flirts with female customers and fronts a band
whose tempos dance above the diners' heads like aromas from the
kitchen.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually we learn that Toninho's life has not been all congas
and sambas. He has had literally to labor under Isabella, whose
lifelong and pronounced motion sickness means she has to be in
control of everything. (She gets nauseated whenever she isn't
driving, for example.) When Isabella catches him on top, so to
speak, with another woman, she runs off to San Francisco, suffering
on the plane ride, and moves in with her old friend, the wise drag
queen Monica (Harold Perrineau Jr.).
</P>
<P>
   Isabella becomes the toast of the city as host of a nightly
television cooking show, ``Passion Food.'' This happens because she
has made an offering to Yemanja, goddess of the sea, to free her
from her broken heart over Toninho. Apparently Yemanja's spell
works too well because not only does Isabella feel better the next
day, but now every man she sees fall in love with her. Using
otherworldy conjuring to make Cruz more attractive to men is as
redundant as a spell to give the lethal boxer Roy Jones Jr. a third
fist.
</P>
<P>
   One wishes ``Woman'' had more fun with the food-as-sex metaphors
it toys with, but the director Fina Torres _ whose previous
``Celestial Clockwork'' was also about legerdemain, appetites and a
Latina heroine experiencing dislocation _ has a spirited light
touch. The banter at the television station is quite funny, and not
as soft-headed as the rest of the film.
</P>
<P>
   Isabella loves to use peppers _ she gets lost in a reverie
talking about the different types _ but this would-be spicy film
has been made blandly palatable.
</P>
<P>
   When Isabella becomes more glamorous, Cruz's makeup is heavier,
and the delicacy of her features is lost. When a photographer says,
``I'm gonna need a big Julia Roberts smile from you,'' it's
redundant because Isabella has already been smoothed out to look
like she's about to star in ``The Pelican Brief.'' Cruz is rescued
from her earlier mopey frowning and tears faster than Sally Field.
Like Roberts, she has an incandescent smile, which she gets to
uncork here.
</P>
<P>
   The movie doesn't stoop to calling Monica a godmother, though he
essentially functions in that way, serving as both narrator and
adviser to not only Isabella but also to Toninho and Cliff (Mark
Feuerstein), the television producer who talks Isabella into doing
her show and falls for her as well. Toninho follows Isabella to San
Francisco in an attempt to win her back, and he sings his way
through the high and twisty streets.
</P>
<P>
   The storybook appeal of Brazil is a big part of ``Woman on
Top.'' ``Brazil is a mood, a state of mind,'' Monica tells Cliff,
trying to impart the land's secrets so he can court Isabella. But
despite its adorable star and likability, this is a fable with
little flavor. The best thing you can say about the movie is that
it's real vanilla bean instead of ersatz vanilla.

`URBAN LEGENDS': A MOVIE WITHIN A MOVIE BASED ON LEGENDS BASED ON
LEGENDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (Editors: Production notes appear at end of review.)  
 By DAVE KEHR   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``A serial killer based on urban legends?'' scoffs a character
in the 1998 slasher film ``Urban Legend.'' ``Sounds like a stretch
to me.''
</P>
<P>
   So it was, and so it continues to be in the sequel, ``Urban
Legends: Final Cut,'' even though the new film bears almost no
relation to the original apart from the return of one relatively
minor character.
</P>
<P>
   Set in a fictional northeastern college, the first film used up
most of the urban folk tales grounded in grisly killings _ the
madman with an ax hiding in the back seat of a car, the pet placed
in a microwave to dry off _ and was even forced to invent some of
its own.
</P>
<P>
   About all that is left for the sequel is the one about the guy
(this time, a girl) who awakes in a hotel room after a sexual tryst
to find that one of his kidneys has been removed, presumably for
black market sale _ a tale also recounted in the current
independent release ``Urbania.''
</P>
<P>
   Apart from that, screenwriters Scott Derrickson and Paul Harris
Boardman have been forced to invent more or less original material,
which will still not seem all that fresh to people who have seen
``Scream 3'' _ a demographic that must surely include a significant
portion of the target audience for ``Urban Legends: Final Cut.''
</P>
<P>
   As in ``Scream 3,'' the plot depends on a movie within the movie
_ this time, a student film being directed by Amy Mayfield
(Jennifer Morrison) for her class at Alpine University, an
unaccountably named institution located somewhere in New England.
</P>
<P>
   For her thesis film, Amy comes up with an idea described as
``brilliant'' by her affable professor (Hart Bochner): a serial
killer based on urban legends. But every time Amy and her crew _
which includes a lesbian sound technician (Eva Mendes), a
womanizing director of photography (Marco Hofschneider) and a pair
of nerdy special-effects wizards (Anthony Anderson and Michael
Bacall) _ try to film a murder, a real killing occurs somewhere
nearby.
</P>
<P>
   The director, first-timer John Ottman, does his best to mislead
the audience by creating real murders that turn out to be fake, and
fake murders that turn out to be real, obscuring the line between
Amy's movie and his own. The film tries to imitate the hip
self-consciousness of the ``Scream'' movies by introducing
deliberate cliches (a murdered character returns as his own twin
brother) and spoofing hoary conventions (instead of running toward
safety, potential victims invariably flee toward the nearest dark
wood).
</P>
<P>
   Ottman doesn't have the firm grasp of tone necessary to make his
deliberate ambiguities seem other than simple confusion, nor the
sense of humor necessary to turn the deliberate cliches into
effective satire. Continuity not being on the course schedule at
Alpine University, it is often hard enough to know who is doing
what to whom where, much less why.
</P>
<P>
   The sole returning character is the campus security guard,
Reece, played by Loretta Devine with a high, lilting voice and an
affection for early Pam Grier films. Should there be an ``Urban
Legends 3'' she definitely deserves top billing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Urban Legends: Final Cut'' is rated R (Under 17 requires
accompanying parent or adult guardian). It contains graphic
violence and sexual situations.

SPORTS COLUMN: FINDING A PURPOSE AFTER A LOSS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ark.)  (Sports of the Times) 
 By WILLIAM C. RHODEN    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia _ Every athlete at these Olympics has a story.
Few have a story like the Olympic boxer Jermain Taylor's. A number
of stories all in one: Triumph and tragedy, life and loss, coming
face to face with the unfairness of it all and, ultimately,
claiming victory.
</P>
<P>
   The most recent chapters in his story began last Friday during
the opening ceremony when he stood on the infield with thousands of
other Olympic athletes and watched Cathy Freeman light the Olympic
flame.
</P>
<P>
   ``As soon as she lit that torch, I knew it was on from there,''
Taylor said. ``I knew this wasn't a regular trip. I got to do a
job.''
</P>
<P>
   The road that carried Taylor from Little Rock, Ark., to Sydney
began two years ago. In July 1998, Taylor was in New York competing
with the U.S. boxing team in the Goodwill Games. He won the bronze
medal. Then he returned to Little Rock a hero in the eyes of his
No. 1 fan, his grandmother Gussie Robinson.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came home, my grandmother said, `Baby, I'm so proud of you,'
'' Taylor recalled. ``She was happy for me, even if I did only win
a bronze. For her, just the idea of me doing it. That's my
grandmother. I told her then, `If I make it to the Olympics, I'll
make you proud.'''
</P>
<P>
   Gussie Robinson had five daughters, three sons, 18 grandchildren
and 10 great-grandchildren. ``She had a special relationship with
everybody,'' Taylor said. ``If you need a place to live, you go
over to Grandma's house; if you need a place to stay for the night,
just go to Grandma's house; if you need somebody to talk to, go to
Grandma's. Need to borrow some money, go ask Grandma. She'll give
it to you.
</P>
<P>
   ``Grandma was just always there; and she knew everything pretty
much. You weren't going to put anything past her.''
</P>
<P>
   Four months after the bronze medal victory, Taylor's world, his
family's world, turned inside out. On Nov. 10, 1998, Taylor's
83-year-old great-grandmother discovered Gussie Robinson's body in
bed. She had been murdered. There were no signs of forced entry.
The only clue was that her car was missing.
</P>
<P>
   The family was devastated. As the oldest of five children,
Taylor had always taken the emotional lead, beginning when his
father left. But this was too much.
</P>
<P>
   And the nightmare was not over. While the family grieved, the
police said the prime suspect in the murder was one of Taylor's
uncles, Joe Brown, recently paroled after having served 16{ years
of a 35-year term for aggravated robbery and battery.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Brown lived in a trailer behind Gussie Robinson's yellow
house on Wright Avenue. Two days after her death, the family was
still paralyzed. Brown, who had changed his name in prison to Ahmad
Al-Genius, was named as a suspect.
</P>
<P>
   Two days later, when the police confronted Al-Genius, he took
what the authorities later learned was a bottle of hydrochloric
acid and swallowed it. As officers wrestled him down, he blurted
out a confession that he had killed his mother. Al-Genius died on
Nov. 18.
</P>
<P>
   At his grandmother's funeral, Taylor put his Goodwill bronze
medal in Gussie Robinson's casket.
</P>
<P>
   The last two years have been a process of picking up the pieces
and focusing on one goal: reaching Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it made me a lot stronger,'' Taylor said, `` 'cause
every time I step in that ring I think of her. I talk to her:
`Grandma, I'm out here taking care of business. I'm not messing
around.' In order to do that I had to keep my head on straight, I
knew I had to stay focused on boxing. I had to train hard. I had to
train harder than I ever trained in my life.''
</P>
<P>
   In his first Olympic light-middleweight match on Tuesday, Taylor
stopped Bulgaria's Dimitriy Usagin with a stiff right to the head.
On Saturday he fights Canada's Scott MacIntosh.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's fight drove home the point to the people back in
Little Rock that their favorite son may be building toward
something positive. ``I think they're just now starting to realize
how big the Olympics really are,'' Taylor said.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor is but one athlete among thousands with a mission,
competing at the highest level against the world's best. But he's
still not out of the emotional woods in the aftermath of his
family's trauma.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he died, I was like, `Dang,' he's dead, too,'' Taylor
said of Al-Genius. ``He killed himself. That's a heavy thing, to
have two people in your family die within the same week. It hits
you hard. I didn't know whether I should hate my uncle or I should
forgive him, or just go on with my life and not even think about
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still got one more uncle; he's in jail,'' Taylor continued.
``He and Joe were locked up together. I don't know, as soon as he
gets out, if I can face him. I've been thinking about that every
day. If he gets out of jail, is he going to be the same.''
</P>
<P>
   So this is Jermain Taylor, age 22. A young Olympian carrying an
Olympic-sized weight in his heart each day he wakes up, each time
he steps in the ring.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Taylor said the violent nature of his grandmother's
death no longer matters. All that matters is the loss and the
inspiration.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard knowing that my grandmother's life was taken,'' he
said. ``But I just miss my grandmother. I don't care how she died.
I just miss her.''

NFL MATCHUPS FOR WEEK 4 
</HEADLINE>
   By THOMAS GEORGE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   GAME OF THE WEEK
</P>
<P>
   Jets (3-0) vs. Tampa Bay (3-0) (4 p.m. Sunday)
</P>
<P>
   When the Jets and Tampa Bay connected on the Keyshawn Johnson
trade last April, it insured that this game would be a focal point
of the 2000 season. It was a game to circle on your calendar, as
Johnson did. Johnson has done his part to keep things spicy and the
Jets have heard his noise from afar. The Jets, in return, have
offered a tweak or two at Johnson, but in much milder tones.
Johnson made the Jets a better team and he has done the same for
Tampa Bay. Johnson will make plenty of plays in this game. But it
is the Tampa Bay defense that figures to rule. A great matchup, the
Jets' offensive line vs. Tampa Bay's monster defensive front. Also,
look for the Bucs to pick on Jets defensive back Marcus Coleman.
</P>
<P>
   Buccaneers, 23-13.
</P>
<P>
   SUNDAY 1 P.M. GAMES
</P>
<P>
   Cincinnati (0-2) vs. Baltimore (2-1)
</P>
<P>
   The Bengals, in their sparkling new stadium, lost the opener to
Cleveland and then went to Jacksonville last week and suffered a
13-0 loss. The one thing the Bengals were supposed to have going
for them was offense; that is coach Bruce Coslet's forte. But Akili
Smith has thrown one touchdown pass and four interceptions, running
back Corey Dillon is averaging only 2.5 yards per rush and receiver
Peter Warrick has not scored a touchdown. This Ravens defense is
not one to meet under such circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   Ravens, 30-14.
</P>
<P>
   New England (0-3) vs. Miami (2-1) The Miami defense is clicking.
It has three players with at least two interceptions, is allowing
only 6.3 points per game and has allowed only one touchdown. It is
fast, quick and decisive. Credit coach Dave Wannstedt and his staff
for massaging this defense into a force. The Patriots thought their
defense might play this way; they knew their offense was in
trouble, just not how much.
</P>
<P>
   Dolphins, 20-13.
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee (1-1) vs. Pittsburgh (0-2)
</P>
<P>
   One of the reasons Tennessee soared to the AFC championship last
season was because it has made a habit of beating Pittsburgh, the
recent kings of the AFC Central division. The Kings now are
Jacksonville and Tennessee. The Titans offer a reminder.
</P>
<P>
   Titans, 22-17.
</P>
<P>
   Detroit (2-1) vs. Chicago (0-3)
</P>
<P>
   The Lions have not gained what they anticipated from back James
Stewart. Sometimes his runs look sluggish and he looks
disinterested. He looks like the backup that he was in
Jacksonville, not the exciting starter he was supposed to be. There
is plenty of time for Stewart to change that, but not here. Chicago
finally gets over the hump.
</P>
<P>
   Bears, 24-20.
</P>
<P>
   Philadelphia (1-2) vs. New Orleans (1-2)
</P>
<P>
   Joe Horn has caught 24 passes, the most in the NFC, and 12 more
would break his career-high for the season in catches. That is
amazing and says plenty about the Saints' choice to pluck Horn away
from Kansas City and about Jeff Blake's choice of a favorite
target. The Saints play stiff defense here and that earns them this
victory.
</P>
<P>
   Saints, 16-14.
</P>
<P>
   St. Louis (3-0) vs. Atlanta (2-1)
</P>
<P>
   The Rams at this juncture last season had scored 100 points.
They are flying on offense but have been scorched on defense,
allowing nearly 400 yards of offense per game and no fewer than 24
points in each of their three games. Atlanta was outscored by 76-20
in two games against St. Louis last year. That is an average score
of 38-10. A little closer this time, but expect similar results.
</P>
<P>
   Rams, 28-20.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco (0-3) vs. Dallas (1-2)
</P>
<P>
   These teams have met in six NFC championship games. Both are
nowhere near that caliber now but still enjoy their rivalry. Is
this Dallas team, not as talented as others, better off with the
more mobile and athletic Randall Cunningham at quarterback than
Troy Aikman? Sure looks that way.
</P>
<P>
   Cowboys, 27-23.
</P>
<P>
   SUNDAY 4 P.M. GAMES
</P>
<P>
   Cleveland (2-1) vs. Oakland (2-1)
</P>
<P>
   It has been 21 years since the Browns played in Oakland.
Cleveland can win its third straight game for the first time since
1995. The Raiders, though, have more speed, especially in back
Napoleon Kaufman, who leads the league with an 8.9 average yards
per carry. Kaufman and receiver Andre Rison will produce big games.
</P>
<P>
   Raiders, 20-6.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas City (1-2) vs. Denver (2-1)
</P>
<P>
   Elvis Grbac leads the league in touchdown tosses but Denver has
been an opportunistic team and leads the league in turnover
differential. If the Chiefs lead at halftime, watch out _ they have
won 26 straight games when leading at the half. But the Chiefs are
1-3 in their last four at Mile High and will find it rough going
stopping either Denver quarterback, Brian Griese (shoulder injury)
or Gus Frerrote.
</P>
<P>
   Broncos, 28-24
</P>
<P>
   Green Bay (1-2) vs. Arizona (1-1)
</P>
<P>
   Brett Favre has never played at Arizona. After this long day in
the desert, he will probably not want to return. Green Bay escaped
0-3 start by slipping past Philadelphia, 6-3, in Green Bay. The
Packers are not ready for this road test, especially since the
Cardinals enjoyed a bye last week and will enter this game
particularly fresh.
</P>
<P>
   Cardinals, 17-9.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle (1-2) vs. San Diego (0-3)
</P>
<P>
   Chargers' coach Mike Riley has suffered plenty of bumps and
bruises in only his second season, but he has been able to master
Seattle and coach Mike Holmgren. Ryan Leaf returns at quarterback
for San Diego and is this another bump and bruise for Riley?
Probably not. Leaf should make good on his second chance this
season as San Diego's starter. Check out the Seattle run defense,
which allows only 2.8 yards per carry.
</P>
<P>
   Chargers, 19-14.
</P>
<P>
   SUNDAY NIGHT 8:30
</P>
<P>
   Washington (1-2) vs. Giants (3-0)
</P>
<P>
   Brad Johnson has thrown more passes than any quarterback in the
league. That, in part, is Washington's problem, along with the fact
that Johnson hasn't done much with those throws (2 touchdowns, 5
interceptions). Who would have thought that Tiki Barber would have
outrushed Stephen Davis by 326 yards to 283 yards? And Barber has
done it carrying the ball 24 times fewer than Davis. The Giants'
defense is not going to let Davis run crazy. In fact, it wants to
atone for that 50-point debacle vs. the Redskins last season. It
will.
</P>
<P>
   Giants, 13-6.
</P>
<P>
   MONDAY NIGHT
</P>
<P>
   Jacksonville (2-1) vs. Indianapolis (1-1)
</P>
<P>
   The ball should stay in the air more than on the ground since
this game features the AFC's top three receivers. Jacksonville has
two of them in Jimmy Smith and Keenan McCardell while Marvin
Harrison counters for Indianapolis. The Colts enjoyed a bye week
and spent that time trying to work on turnover-free football (it is
minus-4 in turnover differential) and trying to devise a way to
make its defense stiffer. Fred Taylor returns at running back for
Jacksonville but the Colts will be too excited and prepared to
allow any Jaguar to spoil a special night in the RCA Dome.
</P>
<P>
   Colts, 30-26.

`UNDER SUSPICION': NOTHING IS WHAT IT SEEMS, OR IS IT? 
</HEADLINE>
  (Production notes at end of review) 
 By ELVIS MITCHELL    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   A movie featuring Gene Hackman and Morgan Freeman promises a
battle of the aging titans, two men who still have enough fight in
them to square off and throw the right punches when the clinch
demands it of them. ``Under Suspicion,'' an update of the 1981
French psychological thriller ``Garde a Vue'' that has been moved
to Puerto Rico, pits them against each other. Freeman is Benezet, a
police detective with a complicated relationship with Henry Hearst
(Hackman), a lawyer accused of the murder of two young girls.
</P>
<P>
   In Claude Miller's original, draggy and slight piece, the
taciturn cop circled the upper-class worm and both men seemed to be
sweating dirt. As the drab tension collected, the interrogation
room seemed to get smaller with each passing moment.
</P>
<P>
   Although ``Garde a Vue'' is a film that Hackman has maintained
an interest in remaking, there's an inherent difficulty in finding
an American context for French thrillers, which often rely on
attenuation and on squeezing air out of tight spaces.
</P>
<P>
   It is an approach that American movies have long since abandoned
for the most part, perhaps because it's feared that it may make
them look cheap. There's also an implicit lack of trust in the
audience's interest in minimal dramas and in the actors' abilities
to make them work.
</P>
<P>
   Swimming against this tide might be one of the things Hackman
found attractive about ``Garde'' and impelled him to find a way to
get it to the United States market. This is an admirable motive,
and it's about all ``Suspicion'' has going for it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Suspicion'' employs the kind of old-fashioned class
distinction that puts the rich man at a disadvantage from the
outset; he's got to be guilty of something, as the wealthy
generally are in almost every movie in the last 20 years, with the
possible exception of ``Arthur.'' Hackman's Hearst has the pinched
face of a man concealing a secret badly.
</P>
<P>
   His much younger wife (Monica Bellucci) has been freezing him
out, and she is incensed by his interest in her young niece.
Freeman's condescension rises to the surface a little too quickly,
and his grilling of Hackman as a child-murder suspect gives him an
authority that translates into an arch superiority.
</P>
<P>
   The director, Stephen Hopkins, falls back on the security of
overscaled filmmaking technique, with cameras darting through the
rooms _ which seem to be as large as much of San Juan, where the
film takes place _ as if they were mounted on stealth helicopters.
He tries to liberate his actors from the tyranny of the
talking-heads syndrome, but ``Suspicion'' still appears to be a
somewhat sinister episode of ``Nightline.''
</P>
<P>
   Hopkins falls victim to the corny misconception of opening up a
stagy piece by giving the characters elbow room within the large
sets _ in this case, enough for Tiger Woods to swing for about 300
yards. He understands that the conversations need something, since
they're mostly poses for the two lead actors to assume, stances
that quickly disintegrate into shouting matches while Hackman and
Freeman lock their jaw lines into grim countenances.
</P>
<P>
   Even after the surprise ending _ which isn't much of a surprise
to anybody, although the two leads invest a great deal of energy in
trying to stave off the plodding and inevitable denouement _ the
nature of the alleged crime makes ``Suspicion'' too pat a conceit;
there's not much to be suspicious of.

`PRINCE OF CENTRAL PARK': FROM FOSTER CARE TO RESIDENT WAIF IN
CENTRAL PARK 
</HEADLINE>
   (Editors: Production notes appear at end of review.)  
 By DAVE KEHR   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Prince of Central Park'' is a nonmusical adaptation of a
musical play originally produced by Abe Hirschfeld, the real estate
developer and erstwhile newspaper publisher, at the Al Hirschfeld
Theater in Miami Beach. In its original incarnation, it starred
Nanette Fabray; it later appeared briefly on Broadway with Jo Anne
Worley. It is now a vehicle for Kathleen Turner, Danny Aiello,
Cathy Moriarty and Harvey Keitel, none of whom sing or look even
vaguely inclined to do so.
</P>
<P>
   Stripped of its score, ``Prince of Central Park'' seems naked
and painfully vulnerable. With no music to excuse or expand upon
the stylized characters and improbable situations, the film,
directed by the television veteran John Leekley (HBO's ``Spawn''),
remains a sadly earthbound thing, mired in a dismal realism that
lies far from its natural environment.
</P>
<P>
   The prince of the title is 12-year-old JJ Somerled (Frankie
Nasso), a sad-eyed child who has been abandoned to the minimal care
of a professional foster mother ( Moriarty, rasping out her lines
between belts of hooch). JJ's real mother, a beautiful Frenchwoman
(Tina Holmes) who appears to him in occasional hallucinations,
disappeared years before, leaving the boy with nothing but a
religious medal and a tremendous natural gift for music.
</P>
<P>
   Following an unusually violent incident of abuse, JJ decides to
run away from his foster mother's gaudy apartment in a Staten
Island housing project and take the ferry to Manhattan, where he
hopes to find his mom. Packing nothing but a portable keyboard (the
batteries have long been dead, but JJ can still hear the music in
his mind), he heads for the carousel in Central Park, scene of his
last fond memory of his mother.
</P>
<P>
   Luckily for JJ, the park turns out to be full of people just as
lonely and sensitive as he is. Turner plays Rebecca Cairn, a
wealthy do-gooder who enjoys long, solitary bike rides and sleeping
on park benches; Aiello is Rebecca's estranged husband, Noah, who
fills his melancholy hours sailing the model ship that was the
favorite toy of his departed son.
</P>
<P>
   Most alienated of all is Keitel, who has glued on a pair of big,
bushy eyebrows and what appears to be a braided billy-goat beard to
play the Guardian, the self-appointed king of Central Park. Like a
troll in a German fairy tale, he lives under a bridge, demanding
tribute from those who pass. He takes a shine to JJ and becomes the
boy's mentor, instructing him in the ways of life on the Great
Lawn.
</P>
<P>
   With all of these characters fighting for JJ's affection (
Moriarty also returns to the field), loneliness seems less a
problem for the boy than keeping his social calendar in order.
Given his ability to analyze and instantly cure the psychological
problems of everyone he comes in contact with _ plus the fact that
he can tickle the ivories like Oscar Peterson _ JJ doesn't seem
likely to remain a waif for long.
</P>
<P>
   ``Prince of Central Park'' is well meaning enough, but a dusty
ordinariness settles over all of its components, from the
insistently bland framing to the generic plot twists of the final
reel. A couple of quick choruses of ``Greensleeves'' couldn't have
hurt.

&HT;     NO JAIL TIME FOR THE CLINTONS 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By MARIANNE MEANS  
 &HT;     c.2000 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The public never did get as exercised over all
those accusations that President and Mrs. Clinton were guilty of
financial hanky-panky in the Whitewater affair as the media and
right-wing conservatives did.
</P>
<P>
   And it now turns out that ordinary people had more common sense
than the political activists and so-called opinion makers.
</P>
<P>
   Independent Counsel Robert Ray finally let the Clintons off the
legal hook this week on the overblown matter of the Arkansas real
estate deal that went sour in the 1980s, long before the 1992
presidential campaign. The scandal's relevance to the presidency
was always shaky, memories of the complicated transactions were
murky and documents were fragmentary or contradictory.
</P>
<P>
   Ray had previously admitted he had no legal case against them in
two other scandals, the mishandling of the White House travel
office firings and the mysterious wanderings of some background FBI
files on former Republican appointees. Ray declared he had found
``substantial evidence'' that Hillary Clinton had played a bigger
role in the travel office affair than she admitted but said he
could not ``prove beyond a reasonable doubt'' _ the appropriate
legal standard for indictment _ that she committed perjury. In the
FBI files fiasco prosecutors never had enough credible evidence to
demonstrate criminal activity by anyone.
</P>
<P>
   By also reporting that he could not prove either the president
or first lady had committed any crime in connection with the
Whitewater investigation, Ray did not lift all suspicion from the
couple. His terse decision, to be detailed later in court filings,
suggested that he was uncomfortable about giving up his pursuit of
them.
</P>
<P>
   But Ray has more judicial sense than his predecessor, that
malicious moralist, Kenneth Starr. No responsible prosecutor will
go to trial with a case he can't prove, despite his own personal
hostility toward his target.
</P>
<P>
   Now, in the eyes of the law, the Clintons are innocent of the
major wrongdoing of which they stood accused. Remember all those
pious pronouncements about no president being above the law? The
principle works in his favor now. Clinton gets the same presumption
of innocence unless proven guilty that less famous mortals do.
</P>
<P>
   If it were not for his reckless dalliance with Monica Lewinsky
and his subsequent verbal squirming under oath, the Clintons would
finally be free of legal harassment for virtually the first time
since they entered the White House nearly eight years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Was all this soap opera stuff really necessary?
</P>
<P>
   It cost taxpayers $52 million to convict 14 people, most of them
relatively minor figures, of Whitewater-related crimes. Despite
heated political charges that White House aide Vincent Foster was
murdered in July 1993, Starr and his minions concluded in October
1997, after a probe that dragged on and on way past the 1996
election, that Foster had committed suicide, just as the police had
said.
</P>
<P>
   If it weren't for the president's womanizing problem, he would
be looking like a martyr today. For her part, his wife has shaken
off pending legal problems that could have destroyed her New York
Senate candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   Ray has hinted that he may still indict the president after he
leaves office for lying about his relationship with Lewinsky. This
move would not sit well with the public. Piling on Clinton now,
after an impeachment trial, court-ordered civil penalties and an
Arkansas disbarment hearing would be vindictive and serve no useful
purpose. It is inconceivable that any fair-minded jury would send a
former president to jail for lying about illicit sex, which may be
immoral but poses no threat to the economy or national security.
</P>
<P>
   Trying to put Clinton in the pokey would be politically insane.
</P>
<P>
   Congress mercifully refused to extend the special counsel law
that created the uncontrollable monster that the Starr
investigation became. Ray is right to wind the office down.
</P>
<P>
   No future president should be exposed to such a continuous,
expensive, explosive and ultimately fruitless probe. There ought to
be some limits to human indecency, even in a highly partisan
atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   If the Justice Department turns out to be an inadequate monitor
of administration honesty, congressional subpoena power in the
hands of the party not in the White House should serve as a
sufficient partisan brake on presidential wrongdoing. It's time to
stop trying to criminalize the political system and focus on what
really matters, such as public policy issues like the future of
Medicare and Social Security.

`DOUBLE PARKED': HIGH HOPES AND BIG REVELATIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (Editors: Production notes appear at end of review.)  
 By LAWRENCE VAN GELDER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sunshine and shadow color ``Double Parked,'' a modest but
engaging mixture of comedy and drama that derives most of its
energy from the performance of Callie Thorne.
</P>
<P>
   In this film, produced and directed by Stephen Kinsella, who
wrote the screenplay with Paul Solberg, Thorne plays Rita Ronaldi,
a single mother struggling to raise her sickly son, Matt (Rufus
Read), who is befriended by a juvenile delinquent.
</P>
<P>
   At first the delinquent, Bret (Noah Fleiss), is using Matt only
to help him through yet another year in the sixth grade. What's
worse is that Bret is Matt's illegitimate half-brother, fathered by
the drunken, abusive brute who used to be Rita's husband, a man
Matt has been told is long dead.
</P>
<P>
   So, while Matt's schoolwork suffers, he drifts into petty crime
under the tutelage of Bret, whose demanding, punk girlfriend
dispenses drugs and sexual favors in return for some of Bret's
loot. Bret's father, ever ready to administer a good beating, also
shares in the proceeds.
</P>
<P>
   Rita, having lost her job as a waitress, but not her spirit,
when she draped her boss in spaghetti after he groped her, listens
to self-help tapes and endures blunt rejections as she seeks work.
But eventually her sheer persistence wins her an appointment as a
Jersey City, N.J., meter maid.
</P>
<P>
   To make life even better, she captures the eye of the handsome
Karl Severson (William Sage), who just happens to be Matt's
concerned teacher. But Matt has defied her instructions to stay
away from Bret. Big trouble and big revelations are just around the
corner.
</P>
<P>
   But as evidenced by the performances of Thorne, of Eileen
Galindro as her over-the-top meter maid rival, Dolores Gonzalez,
and of Anthony De Sando as Dolores' cousin Angel Gonzalez, who
fancies himself God's gift to Rita, in the end Kinsella's heart is
unsurprisingly on the side of comedy and sunshine.

`URBAN LEGENDS' SEQUEL IS GORY, UNIMAGINATIVE  
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By SEAN AXMAKER  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Urban Legend: Final Cut,'' the sequel to a pale ``Scream''
ripoff, shrugs off all pretentions of cleverness and self-awareness
to bring the body count genre right back to its lowest common
denominator: stupid kids getting hacked to pieces for the blunt,
bloody spectacle of it. No style, no irony and no smarts, just a
vicious streak that lasts 90 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Indie renaissance guy John Ottman, who scored and edited Bryan
Singer's first three films, jumps into the director's chair and
tries to keep a straight face while delivering a slasher script
with a plot that would be laughed out of a ``Scooby Doo'' story
conference.
</P>
<P>
   Spunky girl next door type Amy (Jennifer Morrison, whose pensive
looks pass for thoughtfulness) is an earnest student in ``the
greatest film school that ever existed,'' to quote faculty
Professor Solomon (Hart Bochner, who should fire his agent). Her
thesis film is a thriller based on urban folk tales, only people
are getting murdered for real.
</P>
<P>
   Who is the killer? Smarmy Hollywood brat Graham (Joey _ sorry,
now that's Joseph Lawrence)? Lesbian boom operator and all around
girl Friday Vanessa (Eva Mandes, doing her best Gina Gershon)? Or
could it be (get this) Trevor (vaguely bad boyish Matthew Davis),
the identical twin brother of the barely identifiable suicide
victim Travis?
</P>
<P>
   Ottman can't be faulted for the moronic script, which ignores
the film's entire premise of urban legends recreated in real life
for a simple bloody body count, but he shoulders the responsibility
for its nasty tone and sheer cinematic laziness. A little winking
humor or at least a playful recognition of the film's sheer
absurdity might have taken the edge off the tastelessness.
</P>
<P>
   The roll call of cheap shocks and tired tropes _ slamming doors,
rustling curtains, half-hidden faces that creep up on our heroes
only to be harmless pranks, and the lemming-like rush of potential
victims into dead ends, locked closets and other no exit traps _
are tossed off with bored indifference.
</P>
<P>
   I'm not sure what's most offensive about the film: passing off
grisly violence as a substitute for style or assuming an audience
will accept such trash at face value.

NEWS OF THE SILVER SCREEN 
</HEADLINE>
   By DAVE KEHR    c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Topicality isn't what Kathryn Bigelow had in mind when she began
development on ``K-19'' four years ago. The plot outline of the
film, about a Russian submarine trapped at the bottom of the sea,
sounds alarmingly similar to the plight of the Russian sub Kursk,
which held the world breathless last month.
</P>
<P>
   But ``K-19,'' which Bigelow will begin filming in March, is
based on another incident, though one equally true.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the story of two men, Nikolai Zateyev and Vladimir
Yenin,'' Bigelow said over breakfast earlier this month at the
Toronto Film Festival, where her most recent film, the historical
thriller ``The Weight of Water,'' had its world premiere. Zateyev
and Yenin were Russian submarine captains at the height of the Cold
War in 1961. ``On the maiden voyage of Russia's first atomic
ballistic nuclear submarine,'' she said, ``it had a malfunction in
its reactor at the bottom of the North Sea and began to melt down.
This was off the coast of Norway, about a mile from where there was
a NATO base.''
</P>
<P>
   Kept secret at the time, the incident became public only when
glasnost made it possible for Zateyev to publish his memoirs.
</P>
<P>
   Bigelow, whose work includes the science fiction film ``Strange
Days'' and the police drama ``Blue Steel,'' has never restricted
herself to anything resembling traditional ``women's pictures,''
and ``K-19'' (the title comes from the name of the sub) doesn't
sound like an exception.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over the next few days,'' she said, ``these two men _ Zateyev,
the commander, and Yenin, the executive officer _ managed to avert
what could have been a Chernobyl-like disaster. It was a truly
extraordinary situation that elicited courage in a way almost
unthinkable in the face of certain, catastrophic disaster and
miraculously did manage to have some survivors.''
</P>
<P>
   The script, by the New York playwright Chris Kyle, is based on
original research and interviews, notably with Zateyev's widow.
``One of my technical advisers in St. Petersburg happens also to
have been very, very close with several of the officers on the
Kursk,'' Bigelow said. ``The Kursk incident was an incredibly
emotional experience for me and the people I am working with on
this, because of how close I've become to this project and the
individuals involved, and because of having actually met some of
the survivors of the K-19.
</P>
<P>
   ``But in a way, what happened with the Kursk further impelled me
to make this film. `K-19' examines the courage and the prowess of
these men. This will be the first major American motion picture in
which Russians are the heroes, and I guess I have lofty intentions
for it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now I'm afraid that the Russians are deeply embarrassed,
that their pride is shattered. I feel I want to give them their
pride back, but without the arrogance, and without the Cold War
disinformation. I don't want them to think they're having their
face rubbed in the Kursk incident. I want the opposite. I want them
to see that they're being actually revered. There's a unique
stamina and resilience in their psychology, and when you go back
and read Tolstoy and Pushkin, you see it all. It's an amazing
mind-set, very, very different from our own.''
</P>
<P>
   FACTORY AND FAMILY
</P>
<P>
   The plot line of Laurent Cantet's social drama ``Human
Resources'' hangs on the attempt to impose a 35-hour workweek in
France, a measure intended by the Socialist government to create
more jobs in a country that urgently needs them.
</P>
<P>
   But, Cantet said by phone from his Paris office, ``I noticed
that when I was presenting the film in Sundance that the first
question that journalists from the U.S. and Canada asked me was,
`Is it true that in France you only work 35 hours a week?' And a
lot of them added, `Like that, you can have two jobs at once.' So
there you see a very, very wide gap between our different ways of
conceptualizing things.''
</P>
<P>
   In a restrained, manner, Cantet's documentary-style film tells
of Frank (Jalil Lespert), a young man from the working class who
returns from business school to take a job as a junior executive in
the factory where his father works. At first he hopes to use his
new position to improve the lot of the workers by conducting a
survey to see how the employees would like to see the 35-hour week
structured. But when the smiling boss (Lucien Longueville), who has
taken Frank under his wing, uses Frank's statistics as an excuse to
reduce the work force, the young man finds himself caught in a
classic conflict.
</P>
<P>
   ``The point of departure was the family story,'' Cantet said.
``I wanted to explore the links that necessarily exist between
intimate affairs and politics. Private life is never really
private. Everything we experience has to take the social
environment into account.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the family there is a natural hierarchy between the father
and the son. The idea of the film was to look at the workplace, and
see how that hierarchy could be reversed.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Human Resources'' was cast almost entirely with
nonprofessional actors, many of whom Cantet found by visiting
government unemployment offices. ``I met 500 or 600 people and did
tests of them all and made my choices.''
</P>
<P>
   Danielle Melador, who plays a feisty union representative,
really is a union representative, and is ``just as combative in
life as she is in the film,'' Cantet said. The boss is played by an
actual boss who took time off from his factory in a Paris suburb to
appear in Cantet's movie.
</P>
<P>
   ``Human Resources'' was shot in a working factory in Normandy
that produces parts for cars, but in the film its product remains
somewhat mysterious.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted something abstract, just a bit of twisted metal,
really,'' Cantet said. ``The idea was to show that the father was
attached to his work for work's sake, not out of an artisan's pride
in a well-made object.''
</P>
<P>
   SANITY CLAUSE
</P>
<P>
   ``They were dear to me,'' said Kitty Carlisle Hart, speaking of
her famously unruly co-stars in ``A Night at the Opera,'' the 1935
film she made with the Marx brothers. ``They didn't play any tricks
on me, and they liked me, because we became friends forever after
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Hart will appear at a members' screening of ``A Night at the
Opera'' at 1:30 p.m. Oct. 1 at the Film Forum in New York and
answer questions afterward.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw it recently at a benefit I did in Santa Fe,'' she said.
``And it was the first time that I'd seen it in a long, long time
on a proper screen. Let me tell you something: It's no good on TV.
But on a big screen it is hilarious. I enjoyed it very much.''

TOM TOM CLUB: `THE GOOD, THE BAD AND THE FUNKY' 
SARA LEE: `MAKE IT BEAUTIFUL' 
 
</HEADLINE>
   By ANN POWERS    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The female bass player is a fixture in countless punk and indie
bands. But the stereotypical role owes its existence to real
pioneers, especially Tina Weymouth of the Talking Heads and the Tom
Tom Club.
</P>
<P>
   A wicked funk groovemaker who, along with her husband, the
drummer Chris Frantz, has created some of the most sampled bottom
lines in hip-hop, Weymouth always projects the friendly cool of
someone breaking barriers for fun. Pleasure is the point of the Tom
Tom Club, and in its fifth album, ``The Good, the Bad and the
Funky'' (Rykodisc), the group delivers plenty. Charles Pettigrew,
Mystic Bowie and Toots Hibbert aid Weymouth in adding spice to the
rhythmic curry of reggae, James Brown throwdowns and smooth soul.
</P>
<P>
   Sara Lee, another pioneering bassist, also enlists many notable
friends for her solo debut, ``Make it Beautiful'' (Righteous Babe).
Lyricists include Lee's sometime employers Ani Di Franco and Emily
Saliers of the Indigo Girls. Yet ``Make it Beautiful'' has the
solitary feel of a personal breakthrough. Lee's vocal reserve
complements her delicate playing on songs that stimulate reflection
as well as dancing. Like the joyful Tom Tom Club, Lee plants her
ideas in the rich rhythm beds of disco and New Wave. Both albums
look backward to go forward.

INVESTMENT BANKER TO SUCCEED CHIEF EXECUTIVE AT DEUTSCHE
</HEADLINE>
 By EDMUND L. ANDREWS

<TEXT>
<P>
   FRANKFURT, Germany _ Deutsche Bank AG, the largest bank in
Germany, has appointed a Swiss investment banker to succeed its
chief executive, Rolf-Ernst Breuer, who is scheduled to retire in
2002.
</P>
<P>
   The banker, Josef Ackermann, a former chairman of Credit Suisse
who jumped to Deutsche Bank in 1996, had been considered a strong
contender to succeed Breuer. But the early announcement, so far in
advance of Breuer's retirement, was surprising and may reflect a
shifting balance of power at Deutsche Bank.
</P>
<P>
   Ackermann, 52, has overseen Deutsche Bank's investment banking
operations since his arrival and was in charge of integrating
Bankers Trust after the Germans bought it for $10 billion nearly
two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   But Ackermann also clashed with Breuer and played a role in the
collapse of Deutsche Bank's proposed merger this year with Dresdner
Bank. It was Ackermann and several of his executives who insisted
that Deutsche Bank either sell or close most of Dresdner's
investment banking arm, Dresdner Kleinwort Benson, a position that
contradicted Breuer's contention that Dresdner was ``a jewel.''
</P>
<P>
   Confronted with intense opposition from his own executives,
Breuer reversed himself and went along with Ackermann and his
American head of global markets, Edson Mitchell.
</P>
<P>
   That, in turn, outraged Dresdner Bank's top executives and
eventually prompted Dresdner to walk away from the deal. Since
then, Mitchell and another American investment banker, Michael
Phillip, have been elevated to Deutsche Bank's executive board _ a
remarkable display of Deutsche's increasingly non-German identity.
</P>
<P>
   Breuer, 62, had already made clear that he would step down as
chief executive by the time he reached the bank's mandatory
retirement age.
</P>
<P>
   But he endured intense criticism as a result of the failed
merger with Dresdner, and was so secretive in the dealings that
even top executives like Ackermann knew little about the deal until
it was ready to be announced.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Breuer has been praised for Deutsche Bank's
successful acquisition of Bankers Trust. Defying some investor
skepticism, the merger has been unusually smooth and Deutsche
Bank's investment banking operations provide the bulk of the
company's profit.
</P>
<P>
   Ackermann essentially took over Breuer's post on the management
board when Breuer was named chief executive late in 1996.

TAKING THE CHILDREN: `ALMOST FAMOUS'; `NURSE BETTY'; `BAIT'
</HEADLINE>

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   `ALMOST FAMOUS'
</P>
<P>
   Patrick Fugit, Billy Crudup, Kate Hudson, Frances McDormand,
Jason Lee, Zooey Deschanel, Anna Paquin, Philip Seymour Hoffman
</P>
<P>
   Directed by Cameron Crowe
</P>
<P>
   Rating: R
</P>
<P>
   Running time: 120 minutes
</P>
<P>
   ``You're not out there to join the party,'' a Rolling Stone
editor tells the journalist William Miller (Fugit). ``We already
have one Hunter Thompson.'' Having never met William face to face,
the editor is as yet unaware that on the strength of a few good
clips the magazine has assigned a 15-year-old to produce a piece of
objective reporting on a fast-rising rock group called Stillwater.
</P>
<P>
   The year is 1973 as William, modeled after Crowe during his own
days as a teen-age reporter, joins the Stillwater tour bus in
Tempe, Ariz., and starts to get acquainted with Russell Hammond
(Crudup), the group's guitarist and rising star. He also encounters
Stillwater's lead groupie, a warm and wise teen-ager who calls
herself Penny Lane (Hudson).
</P>
<P>
   ``The enemy: a rock writer,'' somebody warns. But William is a
forthright boy who may fool Rolling Stone with a fake baritone on
the telephone but works his way into the band's confidence with his
boyish charm.
</P>
<P>
   On the road there are calls and messages from his mother, Elaine
(McDormand), a good-hearted and wonderfully expressive worrywart
back in San Diego. William reassures her from pay phones in hotel
hallways while Penny's groupie cohorts loudly invite him to
sessions of sex, drugs and rock 'n' roll.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, William does no drugs and takes a good part of the
movie to lose his virginity. Stillwater carouses some, but
generally sets a good example, keeping its drug intake under
control and leaving hotel furniture intact. William bonds with
Russell, a gentle, sensitive sort, in the face of his rising fame,
and Penny, who is making Russell her last project, as she calls it,
before she moves on to Morocco.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the tour graduates to airplane travel, and during a
midair emergency the band feels compelled to disgorge all kinds of
confessions fit for inclusion in William's article. Rolling Stone
will give him 3,000 words and maybe the cover. ``Don't let those
swill merchants rewrite you,'' warns the critic Lester Bangs
(Hoffman), William's mentor.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   VIOLENCE: A few verbal confrontations.
</P>
<P>
   SEX: This is a rock tour, so sex is everywhere. Virtually none
of it gets on screen, however, and what does is playful and
sanitized.
</P>
<P>
   PROFANITY: Quite a bit, but natural.
</P>
<P>
   FOOTNOTE: ``My wife had an accident with some Quaaludes,''
William tells a hotel operator in his telephone baritone. An
emergency team pumps out Penny's stomach. Russell drops acid, but
while drugs are evident, they are played down.
</P>
<P>
   For Which Children?
</P>
<P>
   UNDER AGE 10: No.
</P>
<P>
   AGES 11-13: Parents may veto, but Crowe depicts his rock
experiences in a happy light. William is an appealing role model.
</P>
<P>
   AGES 14 AND UP: A true rarity: an R-rated film the whole family
(excluding the little ones) can enjoy.
</P>
<P>
   `NURSE BETTY''
</P>
<P>
   Renee Zellweger, Morgan Freeman, Chris Rock, Greg Kinnear, Tia
Texanda
</P>
<P>
   Directed by Neil LaBute
</P>
<P>
   Rating: R
</P>
<P>
   Running time: 112 minutes
</P>
<P>
   After witnessing the horrific killing of her no-good husband, a
sweet waitress named Betty (Zellweger) turns ``disassociative'' by
blocking out the whole thing and driving off to California, where
she plans to unite with the fictional man of her dreams, Dr. David
Ravell (Kinnear), a Los Angeles surgeon in the soap opera ``A
Reason to Love.''
</P>
<P>
   Betty is obsessed with the show and the doctor. This is her
first time outside Kansas, which conjures visions of the yellow
brick road but for one detail: in the trunk of the Buick she has
borrowed from her husband's used-car lot are 10 kilos of drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Unaware of that, Betty proceeds to Los Angeles trailed by the
killers, a couple of enforcers from Detroit: Charlie (Morgan
Freeman), a reflective dreamer who will become infatuated with
Betty's innocence, and Wesley (Rock), a sociopathic hothead who
plays more to type.
</P>
<P>
   In Los Angeles, Betty lands a job at a hospital and actually
meets the actor who plays Dr. Ravell. Totally immersed in the
show's fantasy, or so it would appear, she leads him to believe
that she's merely angling for a part. By now Charlie and Wesley
have traced Betty's snapshots cross-country and are readying for
some scenes straight out of ``The Sopranos.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   VIOLENCE: Especially horrendous, even in an age of extreme movie
violence. To be brief, Betty's husband is scalped. Such severity
may be necessary to establish Betty's flight from reality, but the
act is obviously not a sight for young viewers.
</P>
<P>
   SEX: Simulated sex is performed at the start of the film.
</P>
<P>
   PROFANITY: Plenty.
</P>
<P>
   For Which Children?
</P>
<P>
   UNDER AGE 14: ``Nurse Betty'' is a strange case. After the
killing it becomes a clever, amusing film that, depending on
parental guidelines, is not unsuitable for older children. But the
killing rules it out.
</P>
<P>
   AGES 14-17: Many teen-agers will take the scalping in stride.
There are no other problems.
</P>

   Caught stealing $2,000 worth of prawns (shrimp on steroids), the
impoverished Alvin (Foxx) ends up in the same jail cell as Jaster
(Pastorelli), who has helped steal $42 million worth of gold
bullion from the federal government. Jaster tells the Treasury
Department, represented by the overbearing Edgar Clenteen (Morse),
that he doesn't know what happened to the gold and that he is not
responsible for killing two security people during the robbery.
That was the work of his accomplice. Jaster doesn't know much about
him either, except that he's a computer genius.
</P>
<P>
   That would be the diabolical Bristol (Hutchison doing his John
Malkovich imitation), but the film doesn't catch up to him until
the final explosion and shootout. To track him down, Clenteen has a
transmitter planted in Alvin's jaw in the hopes that Alvin will
draw Bristol out of hiding.
</P>
<P>
   Why should Bristol give a hoot about Alvin? Well, Jaster
double-crossed Bristol during the robbery and hid the gold
somewhere. Bristol figures that Jaster may have told Alvin where
during their incarceration together. So everybody trots around
Manhattan tracked by Clenteen's electronics experts, who percolate
in their command center as if they were directing a moon landing.
(If Alvin is so destitute, where did he get that Rolex?)
</P>
<P>
   &QL;

<P>
   VIOLENCE: The film gets bloody.

<P>
   SEX: Alvin's lovemaking with his girlfriend (Elise) rocks the

   PROFANITY: None (just kidding).

   For Which Children?
</P>

   UNDER AGE 11: A definite no.

   AGES 11-13: Standard action fodder, meaning not entirely

 &HT;    GORE SAYS U.S. SHOULD TAP OIL RESERVE TO EASE PRICES
 &HT;    With GORE-RESERVE.
 &HT;    By SCOTT SHEPARD
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOLLYWOOD, Md. _ Vice President Al Gore said Thursday that the
government should tap the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to help
stabilize rocketing oil prices.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's proposal, coming less than seven weeks before the
presidential election, underlined the political power of the energy
issue, especially in Midwestern battleground states shaken by
gasoline price spikes this summer and facing heating oil shortages
this winter.
</P>
<P>
   Standing in front of white oil storage tanks draped with an
American flag and a campaign banner, Gore lashed ``Big Oil'' for
``unfair profiteering'' at the expense of working families. He
painted his opponent, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, a former oil
company executive, as the candidate ``of big oil, by big oil and
for big oil.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush responded by accusing Gore of using the 571-million-barrel
emergency oil reserve ``for short-term political gain at the cost
of long-term national security.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Strategic Reserve should not be used as an attempt to
drive down oil prices before an election,'' Bush said at a campaign
appearance in Cleveland. ``That's bad policy.''
</P>
<P>
   The political reality, though, is that consumers are getting
nervous about high heating costs as winter approaches.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can hear a little bit of panic in the voices,'' said Beth
Walther(cq), who handles telephone orders at Burchoil Co., the
family-owned heating oil company where Gore spoke. ``They're
worried about what they are going to have to cut out of their
budget to pay their heating bills.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore, citing those fears, also urged Congress to provide $400
million in additional energy assistance for low-income families.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today, there are families ... all across the country who are
wondering how they are going to be able to pay for heat this
winter,'' he said. ``And those who heat with heating oil are
especially concerned.''
</P>
<P>
   In the long run, Gore said, the United States needs to develop
its own renewable sources of energy so that ``we are free forever
of the dominance of big oil and foreign oil.''
</P>
<P>
   But he said ``energy independence'' is a long-term challenge,
and ``we cannot just wait around,'' he added. ``Families need
action now.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore urged the president to approve ``several'' 5-million barrel
swaps in which oil from the reserve would be made available to the
market through bids. The Gore campaign called them ``swaps''
because the oil companies would eventually replace the amount taken
from the reserves, with interest.
</P>
<P>
   The strategic reserve, established after Organization of
Petroleum Export Countries (OPEC) oil embargoes in the early 1970s,
has not been tapped since 1991, during the Persian Gulf war.
</P>
<P>
   ``Swaps'' are not unprecedented, however. This summer, two swaps
occurred when refineries ran short of crude. The refineries are
supposed to replenish the reserve next year.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has been considering using the strategic reserve, and
his chief economic adviser, Gene Sperling, said Gore's ideas are
``very much on the table.''
</P>
<P>
   Sperling rejected the suggestion that politics would affect the
decision. The president will take ``those actions that he believes
are in America's national energy security interests,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has received conflicting advice from various agencies in
his administration. Energy Secretary Bill Richardson has supported
the move, but Treasury Secretary Larry Summers advised the
president in a Sept. 13 memo that such action would be a ``major
and substantial policy mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   Chris Lehane, Gore's campaign spokesman, said Summers' memo
addressed the possibility of withdrawing as much as 60 million
barrels from the reserve, much more than Gore has proposed.
</P>
<P>
   And later Thursday, Summers said Gore's proposal would be ``a
prudent use'' of the reserve and ``could be appropriate in current
circumstances.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore's request marks a reversal of his position last February.
Then, as oil prices spiraled upward, he opposed using the strategic
reserve to lower prices.
</P>
<P>
   Lehane said the latest proposal reflects how much circumstances
have changed.
</P>
<P>
   ``People had already purchased their heating oil last
February,'' Lehane said. ``Now they're starting to store up for
this winter. And the circumstances are that we are on the verge of
an emergency.''
</P>
<P>
   But Bush objected to taking any oil from the strategic reserve,
which he called the ``insurance policy meant for a sudden
disruption of our energy supply or for war.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush acknowledged that high energy prices are ``a serious and
real threat'' to the long-term health of the economy, but blamed
the Clinton administration for letting the country becoming
``increasingly dependent on foreign oil'' over the last seven
years.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas governor said that if elected president, he would push
for aggressive new exploration of oil and natural gas on the North
American continent, including the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge;
expanding refining capacity in the United States, and increasing
electric and hydroelectric capacity.
</P>
<P>
   Bush also promised to ``work with our friends and allies'' in
the OPEC ``to ensure greater stability'' in oil markets.

 &HT;    POLITICAL TICKER: Gore: tap U.S. oil reserves
 &HT;    (EDs: A brief roundup of the day's campaign events, pulled from
Cox staff and wire reports.)
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Facing growing concern over the threat of high heating costs, Al
Gore proposed today tapping the government's emergency petroleum
reserve to force down oil prices before winter arrives. He also
urged Congress to provide $400 million in additional energy
assistance for low-income families and tax credits to oil
distributors to help build up dwindling heating oil stocks.
Speaking at an oil distributorship in southern Maryland, where most
people use oil to heat their homes, he also said foreign producers
must live up to promises to increase supplies. But George W. Bush's
campaign says using the reserve could make the United States
vulnerable to foreign suppliers.
</P>
<P>
   BUSH TO REGIS: CAMPAIGN LIKE `SURVIVOR'
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush, appearing this morning on ``Live With Regis'' in
pursuit of female voters, told host Regis Philbin and guest co-host
Susan Hawk, one of the finalists on the summer CBS ``Survivor''
show, that he watched the popular program as the contestants were
winnowed to the final one. ``I was fascinated to see who was going
to survive. It was kind of like me,'' he said. Bush strode onstage
wearing a dark-on-dark suit and monochromatic shirt and tie made
popular by Philbin, who wore an almost identical outfit. That
prompted the host to say, ``He gave Oprah a kiss, but he wore my
shirt and tie.'' With the appearance, Bush reached an estimated 5
million viewers, most of them women.
</P>
<P>
   U.N. DISMISSES BUCHANAN'S COMMENT
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations has dismissed Pat Buchanan's call to kick the
world body out of the United States, calling it an unimportant
comment by a ``minor candidate.'' ``The United Nations deals with
the government, and so candidates can say whatever they want, but
we take our signals from the government,'' said U.N. spokesman Fred
Eckhard. In a speech at ultra-conservative Bob Jones University in
South Carolina on Monday, Buchanan harshly criticized what he
called a drift toward a one-world government and said the U.S.
should kick the U.N. out of the country. ``If you have trouble
leaving, we'll send up 10,000 Marines to help you pack,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   POLL FINDS LAZIO LESS LIKEABLE NOW
</P>
<P>
   Voter attitudes toward Rick Lazio have turned markedly more
negative since June, with suburban women now moving toward Hillary
Clinton and many New Yorkers saying Lazio came across as harsh and
inexperienced in his debate with Clinton last week, according to
the latest New York Times/CBS News poll. The survey suggested
deterioration in Lazio's standing at the time that most politicians
believe that voters are beginning serious consideration of the
choice before them in the Senate race. Clinton now has a 9-point
lead over her opponent: 48-39 percent. The remaining voters are
undecided or are supporting minor-party candidates. In the last
Times/CBS poll, taken in June, Clinton had a 5-point lead over
Lazio, who had just entered the race. The poll has a 3 percentage
point error margin.
</P>
<P>
   LIEBERMAN WORKS FLORIDA AGAIN
</P>
<P>
   Joe Lieberman kept the Democratic pressure on in Florida today.
In a speech to employees at Cirent Semiconductor in Orlando,
Lieberman touted the Democratic ticket's plans for a high-tech
future _ with a few suggestions that Al Gore was a chief architect
of the nation's current economy. Lieberman's presence in the state
_ for the second time in less than two weeks _ reflected the
importance of the state and its 25 electoral votes. George W.
Bush's brother, Jeb, is governor, and Republicans had long counted
on Florida in the election, but recent polls show the race a dead
heat. Bush planned to campaign here on Friday and Saturday, and
Gore was coming to Florida on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   LOWER RELIGIOUS PROFILE FOR LIEBERMAN
</P>
<P>
   In the three weeks since Joe Lieberman made headlines with a
pair of speeches in which he sought to ``renew the dedication of
our nation and ourselves to God and God's purposes,'' he's been
mentioning God less frequently. Lieberman, a Jew, evoked criticism
from groups advocating separation of church and state and also from
the Anti-Defamation League. The ADL warned that, at a certain
point, emphasizing his religious observance can be ``inappropriate
and even unsettling in a religiously diverse society such as
ours.'' A Pew Research Center poll suggested the public has mixed
feelings about politicians talking about their religious beliefs.
But it also indicated that Lieberman has not experienced a
discernible backlash.
</P>
<P>
   CHENEY FAULTS ADMINISTRATION HANDLING OF SADDAM
</P>
<P>
   Dick Cheney blamed the Clinton administration for letting Iraqi
leader Saddam Hussein ``slip off the hook'' on U.N. weapons
inspections. Campaigning in ``Aerospace Valley''_ an area around
Edwards Air Force Base in California steeped in defense contractors
and aviation history _ Cheney said the United States had a ``very
robust'' inspection capability under President George Bush after
the Persian Gulf War. ``We were all the time going back to make
certain that he wasn't trying to rebuild his biological and
chemical capability,'' said Cheney, who was secretary of defense
during the war. While Cheney says he did not think Saddam poses a
military threat to the United States, ``the thing I worry about is
this administration, I think, has let him slip off the hook, so to
speak.''
</P>
<P>
   LIEBERMAN DEATH THREAT BY NO MEANS ANONYMOUS
</P>
<P>
   A federal court in Tampa, Fla., ordered a man who allegedly made
a death threat against Joe Lieberman jailed pending a psychiatric
evaluation. Curtis C. Fulton, 32, is charged with threatening to
kill Lieberman because of his criticisms of the entertainment
industry. Fulton faces up to three years in prison if convicted. He
allegedly called Lieberman's office Sept. 15 and told a staff
member he had a gun and intended to kill the Connecticut senator.
Fulton left his name and phone number. Agents who went to his Tampa
apartment found that he had put a deposit on a handgun at a
pawnshop the same day he called Lieberman's office.
</P>
<P>
   HONING IN ON POSSIBLE DEBATE-TAPE LEAK
</P>
<P>
   Some Republican and George W. Bush campaign officials, the
Washington Post reports, suspect that the confidential debate
materials that found their way into the hands of a key adviser to
Al Gore last week were pilfered from the Austin offices of Bush's
media consultant, Mark McKinnon. The fact that McKinnon worked for
many Democratic candidates before signing up with Bush has caused
no small amount of angst among some Republican officials, who
fretted about a potential Gore mole in his shop. But other Bush
officials insisted it was too early in the investigation to
definitively say how the theft of a briefing book and a video of
their candidate practicing for his debates with Gore could have
occurred. McKinnon declined a Post request for an interview.
</P>
<P>
   THE DEBATE EXPECTATIONS GAME
</P>
<P>
   The two candidates are jostling over trying to set public
expectations for the series of three presidential debates beginning
Oct. 3 in Boston. Less than two weeks before the first one, Al Gore
said George W. Bush is ``an excellent and formidable debater'' who
has been underestimated in the past. Bush, meanwhile, said Gore is
``a real good debater,'' but that he is looking forward to the
debates. ``I've got something to say. . . . I feel passionately
about issues,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   NADER WITH CELEBRITY FRIENDS
</P>
<P>
   Ralph Nader rallied the crowds with his usual anti-corporate,
pro-labor stump speech at the University of Michigan, but the Green
Party candidate could have left the talking to the celebrity
friends who joined him on the road. Nader stuck to the message
today, focusing on what he called a ``sliding backwards in
environmental achievement.'' He was referring to further depletion
of the ozone layer, the increase of global warming and soil
erosion. He also cited the large number of work place deaths due to
trauma and industrial toxins. Nader was introduced by filmmaker
Michael Moore, known for his criticism of General Motors, and talk
show host Phil Donahue, who have been traveling with the candidate
and revving up the crowds with rousing introductions.
</P>
<P>
   BUSH ON DEFENSE: DETAILS TO COME
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush has scored points with promises to boost military
spending and build a worldwide missile defense system. But in his
speeches and position papers, he doesn't offer dollar figures or
specific proposals for his boldest Pentagon plans. And, according
to his campaign staff, Bush will not get more precise on defense
matters before the election. Bush regularly criticizes Al Gore's
support for a limited missile shield that would cover only the
United States. However, Bush has not yet decided on the
architecture, size, cost or time frame of the much larger system he
proposes, according to Condoleezza Rice, his chief foreign polity
adviser.
</P>
<P>
   BUSH HEALTH ADVISER TIED TO COMPANIES
</P>
<P>
   A principal author of Gorge W. Bush's Medicare plan, Dr. Gail
Wilensky, serves on the boards of eight health care companies whose
fortunes could be affected by the Bush proposal. Wilensky, a former
administrator of the government office that runs Medicare and the
current chair of the panel that advises Congress on Medicare
policy, holds shares and stock options in the companies worth $4
million to $5 million, according to company documents and
Wilensky's own estimates. She said that her relationships with the
health care companies were a matter of public record and denied
that there was any conflict between her service on the corporate
boards and her role as Bush's health policy adviser.
</P>
<P>
   THE GEORGE AND LAURA SHOW
</P>
<P>
   Even though George W. Bush still likes to tell audiences how his
wife, a former school librarian, married him years ago on the
condition that she would never have to make a political speech,
those days are long gone. Now, with Bush in a drive to win back
some of the female voters who polls say are leaning toward Al Gore,
his campaign is counting on Laura Bush to carry political appeal of
her own. And all this week, she has been center stage at her
husband's side, holding her own microphone and taking her own
questions. In this era when candidates may be judged by how they
smooch with their wives, her use of ``our'' and ``we'' make clear
that the campaign is a joint endeavor.
</P>
<P>
   PARTIES AWASH IN `SOFT MONEY'
</P>
<P>
   Four years after a presidential fund-raising scandal led to
intense criticism of the use of ``soft money,'' the two major
political parties are on track to raise twice as much of the
unregulated funds, with Al Gore working almost nightly to help
Democrats match the Republicans' trove. By the end of the year, the
two parties are expected to raise $500 million in soft money,
according to the advocacy group Common Cause, with at least $100
million spent on TV spots that are barely disguised campaign ads
targeted in key states to help either Gore or George W. Bush. That
gusher of spending in the final weeks could play a large role in
determining who wins.
</P>
<P>
   PARTIES PUSHING FOR `HARD MONEY'
</P>
<P>
   This year, both parties have reaped record amounts of ``soft
money,'' the large checks that come from wealthy individuals,
corporations and unions. Now, in their final, urgent push for cash,
the Republican and Democratic money teams are pressing to raise
``hard money,'' the smaller checks _ no more than $20,000 to the
parties _ that come from individual donors. The reason for the
hard-money push can be found in byzantine federal election rules
that require the parties to pay for some of their activities _ most
important, ``issue advertising'' promoting their candidates _ with
a mixture of hard and soft money.
</P>
<P>
   13 PERCENT OF BLACK MEN BARRED FROM VOTING
</P>
<P>
   On Election Day, nearly 1.4 million voting-age black men _ more
than one in eight _ will be ineligible to cast ballots because of
state laws that strip felons of the right to vote. ``Here we are,
50 years after the beginning of the civil rights movement, and we
actually have an increasing number of African-Americans who are
disenfranchised each year,'' said Marc Mauer of the Sentencing
Project, which analyzed 1996 Justice Department statistics along
with Human Rights Watch. Disenfranchised black males account for 35
percent of all Americans now barred from voting because of felony
convictions. Two percent of all Americans, or 3.9 million, have
lost the right to vote, compared with 13 percent of black men.
</P>
<P>
   THE PRIORITIES HOUSE THAT BUSH BUILT
</P>
<P>
   When George W. Bush promised a ``Blueprint for the Middle
Class,'' he wasn't kidding. The newest backdrop to Bush's speeches
is an oversized piece of bluish drafting paper depicting the floor
plan of a two-bedroom, two-bath ranch home _ complete with shrubs,
front walkway and brick patio. Maybe not the most eye-catching or
photogenic campaign prop, the blueprint nonetheless offers a novel
perspective on Bush's campaign priorities: ``Taxes'' were assigned
a back corner bedroom with four windows and a full bathroom.
``Family'' and ``Health care'' share the great room, with what
looks like a galley kitchen, off the front entrance. ``Education''
is tucked into the smallest room, ``Social Security'' the largest.
``Community'' is relegated to the backyard.
</P>
<P>
   WHERE BRADLEY IS NOW
</P>
<P>
   Bill Bradley, who has been out of the political limelight since
losing to Al Gore in the Democratic primaries, has taken a position
as a board member and adviser to the CEO of a new company called
UPromise Inc. The Boston-based firm is trying to create a financial
product that will allow people to amass tax-free savings accounts
for college by purchasing goods from certain vendors. ``Obviously
this is to make money,'' Bradley said. The ex-New Jersey senator
also has written a new political book that will be released next
week, titled ``The Journey From Here.'' It offers his reflections
on the issues he tried to raise in his presidential run.
</P>
<P>
   NEVADA SENATE RACE GETS A LITTLE CLOSER
</P>
<P>
   Republican Sen. John Ensign's 20-point lead in Nevada over
Democratic challenger Ed Bernstein has been cut nearly in half. A
new Mason-Dixon poll (4 percentage point margin of error) showed
Ensign's support dropping to 50 percent from 56 percent in June.
Bernstein was the choice of 39 percent, up from June's 36 percent.
Undecided voters increased from 8 percent in June to 11 percent.
Bernstein, a millionaire personal injury lawyer and abortion-rights
advocate, has begun airing ads hammering the conservative Ensign on
his strict opposition to abortion. Both men are competing for the
Senate seat held by retiring Democrat Richard Bryan.
</P>
<P>
   FILE IT UNDER `SILLY'
</P>
<P>
   Oregon congressional candidate Brian Boquist and his supporters
have gotten into a rough spot for handing out free emery boards.
State law mandates that candidates aren't supposed to distribute
anything of value to voters, a prohibition that tripped up
supporters of Jimmy Carter when they handed out peanuts to Oregon
voters in the 1976 presidential election. The state Elections
Division began investigating Boquist, a Republican, after receiving
a citizen complaint that his supporters were handing out free
fingernail files marked ``Boquist for Congress'' from a booth at
the Oregon State Fair. The 1970s law is aimed at preventing
candidates from trying to buy votes.

RECAPTURE THOSE HAPPENIN' '70s 
(For use after Sept. 23, 2000, by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BARBARA DeWITT 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Picture it. Shag carpeting, harvest gold refrigerators,
terrarium lamps and flocked wallpaper.
</P>
<P>
   It was the decorating style of the early '70s, the years when
Nixon was prez, young women wore hot pants and gypsy 'dos, men wore
cuffed bell bottoms and leisure suits, and everybody gathered
'round the tube to watch ``All in the Family.''
</P>
<P>
   A decade that remains an embarrassment in decorating circles,
provided fodder for the ``Roseanne'' TV show in the late '80s, and
is ever-so-slyly resurfacing into the homes of the young and hip.
You know the crowd. Those 20-something kids and celebs who live in
Silver Lake and Los Feliz and hunt flea markets for hefty dark oak
tables to be paired with gold or olive green velvet-covered chairs,
hopefully with the original tacky braid or fringe in place.
</P>
<P>
   Older young moderns of Hollywood, such as Gwyneth Paltrow,
Claire Danes and Winona Ryder are focusing on the '50s, and the
result is a melting pot of retro ideas that's spilling out into
decorating showrooms around town with a lot of funk and fun.
</P>
<P>
   At Civilization, a Los Angeles furniture store that caters to
the retro- trendy crowd, manager Steve Melendrez saw the decorating
change on the horizon and quickly changed gears. Of the store once
known for all things Shabby Chic, Melendrez says, ``Now it's
one-of-a-kind furnishings with a '50s and '60s vibe, plus '70s
sectionals. Yeah, they're back, and that shag carpeting we once
laughed about is coming back, too ... but I think it'll be a little
too trendy for us, especially in olive green.''
</P>
<P>
   Says Melendrez, ``Most people recall the '70s as the era of
green and gold appliances, but there were also a lot of ethnic
designs, and our best sellers right now are multicultural pieces
such as heavy black lacquered opium tables with rattan in the
middle, Chinese wedding chests and sea grass chairs and baskets.''
</P>
<P>
   Accents such as Marimekko prints, Pucci's zig-zag lines and
geometric prints are showing up on the hippest new rugs, according
to Donna Warner, editor in chief of Metropolitan Home magazine.
</P>
<P>
   While she's talking about the past prints of the Peacock
Revolution, Studio City designer Elisabeth Fry of Crazie Daisie has
focused on the hippie generation that reveled in handcrafted looks
with a new collection of '70s-inspired rugs.
</P>
<P>
   Her favorite is a leopard print-on-leather rug shaped like a
traditional bear skin to throw over a big leather chair or rattan
trunk. ``I love leopard print, and it coincided with the current
decorating trend. And then, when I saw a similar rug in a magazine
layout on Kevin Costner, I decided to make my own, adding red
beads,'' Fry explained.
</P>
<P>
   IKEA is loaded with funky '70s inspirations, from chrome stools
in the kitchen to lacquered steel lamps with plastic shades in
whimsical shapes reminiscent of that favorite '70s icon _ the Lava
lamp.
</P>
<P>
   Pottery Barn carries beanbag chairs and polka dot pillows, but
it's Target that has the retro market covered. The store has
focused on younger customers shopping for dorm rooms and first
digs, offering striped butterfly chairs, mosaic glass accent lamps,
swinging swag lamps (sorry, no terrarium styles), and fluffy
feather lamps on chrome pedestals that look like fashion
accessories from an ``Austin Powers'' movie.
</P>
<P>
   Retailers haven't reported any interest in bentwood rockers,
those cane- seated uncomfy rockers that fans of ``The Mary Tyler
Moore Show'' went running out for, but if shag carpeting can come
back, anything can.
</P>
<P>
   Even doorways filled with strings of crystal beads.

<P>
   Here is a selective listing by critics of The New York Times of
new or noteworthy movies currently playing in theaters. Running
times and ratings of films are in parentheses.
</P>
<P>
   `ALMOST FAMOUS,' starring Patrick Fugit, Billy Crudup, Kate
Hudson and Philip Seymour Hoffman. Written and directed by Cameron
Crowe (R, 120 minutes). Crowe's loose, affectionate look back on
his earlier career as a teen-age rock journalist overflows with
wonderful performances and memorable moments. Fugit brings the
perfect balance of intelligence and innocence to the role of
William Miller, a San Diego teen-ager who takes to the road with a
scruffy band called Stillwater, on assignment for Rolling Stone.
``Almost Famous'' isn't perfect _ it lacks a necessary dimension of
demonic sleaze _ but Crowe's smart, compassionate writing, and the
performances of Crudup, Hudson, Jason Lee and Frances McDormand
(among many others) make it hum (A.O. Scott).
</P>
<P>
   `BRING IT ON,' starring Kirsten Dunst, Jesse Bradford and Eliza
Dushku. Directed by Peyton Reed (PG-13, 110 minutes). Even though
it does feature young women bouncing around in skimpy outfits, this
cheerleader comedy, directed with giddy, sometimes sloppy pep-rally
intensity by Reed from a brisk, slangy script by Jessica Bendinger,
is more than a low-minded appeal to male lechery. Though bound by
the conventions of the sports movie and the teen-age romantic
comedy, ``Bring It On'' has a fine satirical edge, and at least
glances at some serious issues of race and sexuality. It's also a
vehicle for the vibrant comic talents of Dunst, ably supported by
Bradford as her cute, nonconformist love interest, and Dushku as
his sister (Scott).
</P>
<P>
   `THE CELL,' starring Jennifer Lopez, Vincent D'Onofrio and Vince
Vaughn. Directed by Tarsem Singh (R, 110 minutes). A serial killer
named Stargher (D'Onofrio) who abducts women and imprisons them in
a Plexiglas cell that slowly fills with water has a seizure and
goes into a coma. His latest victim is trapped in his cell, and she
has to be found before the automated torture takes her life. An FBI
agent (Vaughn) talks a child psychologist (Lopez) into using an
experimental technique to enter the killer's subconscious. Singh's
talents haven't quite jelled into storytelling yet. He folds this
tale over and over on itself, working with a script that blends
elements of ``The Silence of the Lambs,'' ``Manhunter,'' ``The
Matrix,'' ``Seven,'' ``Dreamscape'' and ``Spellbound'' with the
stop-motion animation of the brothers Quay (``Street of
Crocodiles''), the moody photography of Matt Mahurin, the paintings
of Francis Bacon and so many other things that there's no there
there (Elvis Mitchell).
</P>
<P>
   `DUETS' starring Huey Lewis, Gwyneth Paltrow, Maria Bello, Andre
Braugher, Scott Speedman and Paul Giamatti. Directed by Bruce
Paltrow (R, 113 minutes). Paltrow's musical follows the adventures
of six lost souls looking for salvation in the demimonde of
competitive karaoke. The movie is a mess, lurching from dark satire
to soapy melodrama and punctuated with squirmingly earnest
renditions of songs like ``Bette Davis Eyes'' and ``Hit Me With
Your Best Shot.'' But ``Duets'' has its moments of brilliance, and
a certain reckless integrity. The ensemble cast features Lewis and
Gwyneth Paltrow, the director's daughter, but they're overshadowed
by Giamatti's over-the-top performance as an alienated businessman.
This is a very bad movie, but from time to time you catch glimpses
of a very good movie trapped inside, struggling to get out (Scott).
</P>
<P>
   `GOYA IN BORDEAUX,' starring Francisco Rabal, Jose Coronado,
Dafne Fernandez and Maribel Verdu. Written and directed by Carlos
Saura (R, 94 minutes). There's nothing subtle about Saura's
splashy, sensuous biographical montage of the great Spanish artist
Francisco Goya, whom the movie portrays as an 18th-century raging
bull. Crammed with surreal imagery that quotes from his paintings,
the movie is a series of deathbed flashbacks, many of them
recollections of his passion for the fiery Dutchess of Alba.
Gorgeously lighted and photographed by Vittorio Storaro (Stephen
Holden).
</P>
<P>
   `MADADAYO,' starring Tatsuo Matsumura. Directed by Akira
Kurosawa (not rated, 134 minutes). In the course of his long
career, Kurosawa, who died in 1998, made a number of great movies.
His last film, ``Madadayo,'' released in Japan in 1993, lacks the
narrative intensity of emotional range to be considered among his
masterpieces, but within its own modest proportions it achieves a
kind of perfection. The story is not much: A retired professor in
postwar Tokyo lives out his twilight years in the glow of his
former students' devotion and declares his unreadiness to say
farewell to the life he lives with humor and gusto. But Kurosawa's
absolute assurance as a filmmaker and his unabashed affection for
his characters make ``Madadayo'' a richly and in a way,
inexplicably, satisfying movie (Scott).
</P>
<P>
   `NURSE BETTY,' starring Morgan Freeman, Renee Zellweger, Chris
Rock and Greg Kinnear. Directed by Neil LaBute (R, 112 minutes).
Alternately hilarious, poignant and gory, this modern fairy tale,
which follows an aspiring nurse (Zellweger) suffering from
traumatic amnesia to Los Angeles to win the love of her favorite
soap-opera character, is a contemporary ``Wizard of Oz.'' Hollywood
is the Emerald City. Kinnear is the self-centered actor who plays
her heart's desire on television. Freeman and Rock are a sadly
introspective hit man and his hotheaded protege who follow her
across the country with intention to do harm. This may be the
deepest and funniest American comedy since David O. Russell's
``Flirting With Disaster'' (Holden). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   `THE ORIGINAL KINGS OF COMEDY,' starring Steve Harvey, D.L.
Hughley, Cedric the Entertainer and Bernie Mac. Directed by Spike
Lee (R, 117 minutes). Filmed before a live audience on two nights
in February in Charlotte, N.C., the self-proclaimed Kings of Comedy
swagger across the stage, urban legends in resplendent outfits.
Until a couple of years ago the comedians' exposure was limited
mostly to cable television. Here their comedy gives audiences that
have never seen anything like it a hilarious window on a new world.
They display their chops when they talk about family, specifically
African-American family with roots in the South (Mitchell).

 c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHAPEL HILL, N.C. _ Georgia Carroll Kyser's lovely face launched
a museum.
</P>
<P>
   Four years ago, it was her face that seized the attention of
Texas businesswoman Cathy Bonner, as she scouted Dallas venues to
celebrate the lives of women in American history. It was Kyser's
face on a 16-foot statue of a nude woman rising majestically from a
cactus. Her spirit watching over a decaying art deco building,
neglected for 25 years, with gaping holes in the roof.
</P>
<P>
   ``We saw the statue and we just knew we'd found the right
home,'' says Bonner, who founded the new $30 million Women's Museum
in Fair Park, which opens Sept. 29. ``That's an example of what we
call `hidden hands' in the project.''
</P>
<P>
   Quirk of fate.
</P>
<P>
   In 1936, the model for that statue _ Spirit of the Centennial _
was just a 16-year-old Texas girl named Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   At 80, Georgia Kyser's life has circled almost back to the
beginning. There have been so many stages in her life, each of them
remarkable in different ways.
</P>
<P>
   The limelight in New York, the limelight in Hollywood. The
later, quieter _ but not too quiet _ years in Chapel Hill, N.C. The
beauty, the singer, the wife of the celebrity, the mother, the
student, the supporter of causes.
</P>
<P>
   But the start of it all was _ so appropriately for a Texan _ a
pushy aunt and a Miss Bluebonnet contest. Georgia Carroll, as she
was known then, was a student at Dallas' Woodrow Wilson High School
with a pretty face and figure and a stage-mother Aunt Edna. Their
opportunity was the Texas Centennial Exposition Bluebonnet contest
in 1936, a competition to select a young woman to be the guide for
Eleanor Roosevelt when the first lady visited the state's
centennial fair.
</P>
<P>
   The young Georgia didn't win top prize, but the judges, some of
them artists, took notice. French-born artist Pierre Bourdelle, who
had studied under Rodin and was known for his large artworks for
New York City architectural projects, asked her to sit for a
painting. And when a philanthropist donated money to refurbish a
1910 Dallas exposition grounds building in art-deco style and
commissioned a statue ``dedicated to the pioneering women of
Texas'' to grace its front entrance, teen-age Georgia was tapped to
pose.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just my head,'' Kyser says quickly. ``That I want to
make perfectly clear. I didn't pose in the nude at 16 for the
statue.''
</P>
<P>
   Just her face then. But that's plenty. The attention from the
contest and posing for the artists was intoxicating; she wanted
more, of course.
</P>
<P>
   After graduation, Aunt Edna and Georgia talked Georgia's mother
into a vacation in New York. ``Forty-eight hours after I hit New
York, I had a modeling contract,'' Kyser says. She says she walked
into the John Robert Powers modeling agency, the only one she'd
ever heard of, wearing white, not knowing that women in New York
didn't wear white because of the grime. She was signed on the spot
for a Redbook cover.
</P>
<P>
   Phase One.
</P>
<P>
   Success. Striking oil. The ``it'' girl overnight.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they'd had supermodels, I would have been a supermodel,''
Kyser says.
</P>
<P>
   From what looks like a trophy room in her elegant home in Chapel
Hill, she proudly pulls out a Redbook, the issue the agency signed
her for. There's a photo of a tall, blond, blue-eyed beauty, and
some writing.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the story of Georgia Ann Carroll, that wonder girl
from Dallas, Texas. ... Georgia arrived in New York three months
ago. She knew nobody. She wanted to see the Big City, but she did
not expect to be seen by it. She was mistaken. Forty-eight hours
after her arrival everybody knew her, and every art editor in town
was fighting for her services ...''
</P>
<P>
   Kyser unpacks magazine after magazine, photo after photo,
advertisements, clippings from society columnists.
</P>
<P>
   There are covers from Redbook, Click, Vogue, Cosmopolitan. One
Cosmopolitan cover is a close-up of a pert face wearing a white hat
with a green bow. On a particularly striking Vogue cover, she's
leaning against a red-and-white-striped barbershop-style pole
dressed in a navy suit and white gloves, holding a monkey.
</P>
<P>
   There are testimonial ads for face cream. A Chesterfield ad in
which she's dressed like a majorette. A Doublemint ad with two,
two, two Georgias in one picture.
</P>
<P>
   A New York Sun article describes her as ``the most popular
fashion and photographic model in America.''
</P>
<P>
   It didn't end there, of course.
</P>
<P>
   Phase Two.
</P>
<P>
   Models want to act, and Hollywood wants pretty faces. In 1940,
Warner Bros. signed her.
</P>
<P>
   There are more photos. Kyser picks out one, a picture of 20 or
so Warner Bros. contract actors, and points out faces. Ronald
Reagan is at the far right; Georgia is at the far left. Edward G.
Robinson is in the middle; John Garfield is in the back. The men
are memorable names; the women have largely been forgotten.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a starlet, not a star,'' says an honest Kyser. The movie
studios wanted pretty women as decoration, she explains.
</P>
<P>
   She appeared in movies like ``Affectionately Yours'' and
``Ziegfeld Girl,'' but only in bit parts. Her daughter Kimberly
Kyser says she once went to see a movie her mother had appeared in.
Kimberly dropped her glasses; in the time it took for her to bend
over to get them, she missed her mother's scene.
</P>
<P>
   So it was easy for Georgia Carroll to move on to Phase Three of
her life, performing with big-band leader Kay Kyser in his USO
shows in 1943.
</P>
<P>
   Her role, in the beginning, was solely to select young
servicemen for Kyser to talk to, sort of a 1940s version of Vanna
White. But Kay Kyser heard her singing on the bus one day, and
offered her the role of singer with the band. She liked singing.
Later he offered her a bigger role: his wife.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps it's just the excitement of people committed to an
all-consuming project, but Women's Museum founder Cathy Bonner
insists there have been ``hidden hands'' nurturing her dream
forward.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's strange that we would end up with a building that in 1936
had been dedicated to women anyway,'' muses Bonner.

`REVENGE' IS NOT SO SWEET
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Eds: Fact box below .  `Tonight' refers to Sun., Sept. 24, 2000) 
Our rating: 1 star 
By DAVID KRONKE 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Sweet Revenge'' is apparently aimed at movie fans so patient
and undemanding they could, as they say, watch their favorite
actors read the telephone book. In this case, perhaps the telephone
book would be an improvement on the material offered here, which
squanders the likes of Kristin Scott Thomas, Sam Neill and Helena
Bonham Carter.
</P>
<P>
   Based, we're cryptically informed, on ``the plays of Alan
Ayckbourn'' (maybe writer-director Malcolm Bowbray could've
achieved some coherence by just sticking to one of them), ``Sweet
Revenge'' is a full-fledged misfire originally slated for
theatrical release (instead, Miramax took the tax write-off). Neill
stars as Henry, a middle-age noodge who has lost wife and job and
is about to jump off a bridge when he encounters Karen (Bonham
Carter), who had roughly the same idea but messed up.
</P>
<P>
   They rescue one another, swap sob stories, and Karen decides
they should get revenge on those responsible for their woes _
she'll zero in on the unctuous middle manager (Steve Coogan) who
sacked poor Henry, and he'll drop-kick the wife (Scott Thomas) of
the man (Martin Clunes) who thoughtlessly spurned her. Alas, Henry
learns too late that Karen is a nut job _ while he's falling for
his ostensible target.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, it sounds like a promising set-up, and why not? Hitchcock
used it to great effect a half-century back in ``Strangers on a
Train.'' But the humor is of the most absolutely desperate nature,
and is then belabored on top of that. So not only do we have to see
Neill trussed to a bed decked out in a furry codpiece, or cavorting
in frilly, neon-hued fashion-victim outfits, but we must endure
such spectacles for exasperatingly long stretches after they
would've ceased being funny had they ever been funny in the first
place. Alexandre Desplat's cheesy music ensures that many scenes go
splat, but then, with the rampant tonal confusion and flat
screenplay, no score could've reasonably complemented the on-screen
action.
</P>
<P>
   Bonham Carter looks frankly disconcerted in a couple of scenes;
Neill looks embarrassed, but that's part of his usual shtick so
it's hard to tell whether he's actually acting. Scott Thomas merely
stands around smiling beatifically, but she does it a lot less
convincingly than she has elsewhere. How can we get our sweet
revenge on the filmmakers? &QL; 
---``SWEET REVENGE'' &QL; 
What: ``Strangers on a Train,'' done as a comedy, sort of. The
stars: Sam Neill, Helena Bonham Carter, Kristin Scott Thomas. When:
8 tonight. Where: Showtime.

 UNDATED: South (Mitchell). 
<TEXT>
<P>
   `THE REPLACEMENTS,' starring Keanu Reeves and Gene Hackman.
Directed by Howard Deutch (PG-13, 105 minutes). This negligible
jock comedy, about a group of misfit macho clowns who suit up for
pro football during a players' strike, just wants to be loved: Is
that so wrong? This rehashed and desperate picture stars Reeves as
the honorable, stoic fill-in quarterback. He glides through.
Hackman musters his requisite command as the honorable, stoic
fill-in coach in a wardrobe from the Tom Landry Collection,
mouthing dialogue from ``Hoosiers'' and old United Airlines
commercials. The unvaried ragtag scab players include a pair of
violent bodyguard brothers (Faison Love and Michael Taliferro), a
violent cop (Jon Favreau) and a violent felon on loan to the league
(Michael Jace). Brooke Langton is the cheerleader who resolves not
to date players and dates Reeves anyway. It's a peculiarity from
L.A., a union town: A film that celebrates anti-union activity
(Mitchell).
</P>
<P>
   `SOLAS,' starring Maria Galiana and Ana Fernandez. Written and
directed by Benito Zambrano (not rated, 98 minutes). When a simple
Spanish woman (Galiana) makes a rare journey to the city to be with
her husband, who is having surgery, she stays with her embittered,
alcoholic daughter (Fernandez) who works for a cleaning service.
Galiana's eloquent, utterly unsentimental portrayal of a woman who
expects little of life is an extraordinarily moving portrait of
unconditional love gradually working its wonders (Holden). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   `SPACE COWBOYS,' starring Clint Eastwood, Tommy Lee Jones,
Donald Sutherland and James Garner (PG-13, 105 minutes). Directed
by Eastwood. The second half of Eastwood's new movie is a pleasant
reworking of the standard trouble-in-space movie, with Eastwood
himself leading a heroic team of astronauts that also includes
Jones, Sutherland and Garner. But the first half, which consists of
the comic tough-old-guy interplay among these four sublime actors,
is a boisterous, easygoing tribute to manhood and maturity.
Sutherland and Jones are in especially fine form, as are Marcia Gay
Harden, playing a NASA engineer, and James Cromwell as (once again)
the villainous bureaucrat who tries to deny the old-timers their
shot at celestial glory (Scott).
</P>
<P>
   `SUNSHINE,' starring Ralph Fiennes, Rachel Weisz, Jennifer Ehle,
Rosemary Harris and James Frian. Directed by Istvan Szabo (R, 180
minutes). In Szabo's tale of 20th-century Hungarian history,
Fiennes plays three members of a wealthy Jewish Budapest family _
grandfather, father and son _ who endure the corruption of the
Austro-Hungarian Empire, the viciousness of Fascism and the
brutality of Communism. Fiennes' performances and those of Ehle and
Harris (playing the same character at different stages of life)
help save the film from melodramatic excess. Even though much of
the story is crudely told, ``Sunshine'' is a serious, humane and
thought-provoking attempt to make sense of complicated and painful
historical experiences (Scott).
</P>
<P>
   `THE TAO OF STEVE,' starring Donal Logue and Greer Goodman.
Directed by Jenniphr Goodman (R, 87 minutes). The ``Steve'' in the
title refers to the spiritual embodiment of cool as exemplified by
Steve McQueen, Steve McGarrett (``Hawaii Five-O'') and Steve Austin
(``The Six Million Dollar Man''), a goal to which the blobby and
amiable Dex aspires. In this light-as-a-marshmallow romantic
comedy, Dex (Logue) has lined up quotes from Heidegger, Thomas
Aquinas and ``Don Giovanni'' to rationalize his aimless
pleasure-seeking in this rather aimless movie. Logue's performance
as a nice-guy player _ his weight doesn't keep him from scoring
with the ladies _ makes the movie glide. Dex has a cherub's glee
over what he gets away with. The movie becomes a lot less
interesting when it rolls around to the inevitable quest for a
steady relationship with a woman (Jenniphr Goodman) whose feelings
were trampled in Dex's compulsive fox hunting. ``Tao'' can't redeem
the moves to its predictable end, but its protagonist has a great
time getting there (Mitchell).
</P>
<P>
   `THE WATCHER,' starring Keanu Reeves, James Spader and Marisa
Tomei. Directed by Joe Charbanic (R, 93 minutes). Reeves
enunciates, Spader frets and Tomei just looks tired in this
pretentious, incoherent compilation of serial-killer cliches and
warmed-over MTV-style visual flourishes. Reeves is a sadistic,
diabolically intelligent strangler, Spader the FBI agent whose
psychic torment is the killer's real turn-on and Tomei is the
agent's kindly therapist (Scott).
</P>
<P>
   `THE WAY OF THE GUN,' starring Ryan Phillippe, Benicio Del Toro
and Juliette Lewis. Written and directed by Christopher McQuarrie
(R, 120 minutes). This film feels like a more violent and grim
version of a Coen brothers film; it could be Quentin Tarantino's
``Raising Arizona.'' Its lead characters are small-time criminals
who tend to speak in ambitious and hilariously orotund turns of
phrase. The two, um, heroes, while visiting a sperm bank, hatch a
plan to kidnap a young woman doing surrogate-mother duty for a
wealthy couple. ``Gun'' is a stylish and intelligent film noir
built around the feelings adults have about babies, with a birth
and a lengthy gunfight and standoff (Mitchell).

 CHAPEL HILL, N.C.: muses Bonner. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   So maybe what happened to Bonner's friend Jan Pickle is not so
surprising. Pickle had accompanied Bonner on a fund-raising trip.
Everyone was excited about the museum; so many pieces were falling
into place. Wouldn't it be fun if they could figure out who the
woman was who posed for the cactus statue? But Josset was dead, and
there was no indication of who the woman might have been.
</P>
<P>
   A few weeks later, Pickle was at her mother's home, sorting
through some of her grandmother's papers. There was an old
newspaper article her grandmother had saved about a relative. The
relative was Georgia Carroll, and the article was about the
creation of ``Spirit of the Centennial.''
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   Georgia Kyser's time in the spotlight ended almost as
spontaneously as it began.
</P>
<P>
   Her husband decided to retire at age 44 when his ``Kollege of
Musical Knowledge'' program went off the air; Georgia was 15 years
his junior.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm like a cat with nine lives,'' says Georgia Kyser.
</P>
<P>
   Phase Four. Raising children. Public good works. The pleasures
of life in a college town.
</P>
<P>
   They moved to North Carolina, to a home inherited from her
husband's family. The oldest house in Chapel Hill, the Kyser home
was run down, but they restored it to stunning glory. In the living
room, a mural-size folk art piece in a peaceful blue dominates, but
everything is artful. There is a collection of pottery, and
figurines from Thailand. Eclectic, but all clearly gathered by
someone with an eye for style. Though the home is spacious and
filled with artworks, there's no austere museum aura _ it feels
warm and welcoming.
</P>
<P>
   Like Georgia Kyser.
</P>
<P>
   The still slim and attractive Kyser is generous with her
memories. She's happy to share the details of her life, and to
share her time, even insisting that a visitor share a potpie and a
glass of wine.
</P>
<P>
   She talks about the years in Chapel Hill, about attending the
University of North Carolina, about traveling with her husband when
he lectured, about her involvement in the community.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia Kyser is smart, too: But I've talked too much about my
life, she says. What you want to know about is the spirit of the
women of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   So how does Kyser feel about inadvertently becoming a symbol for
the Women's Museum, the first of its kind in the country?
</P>
<P>
   Kyser starts to give an answer about not being a radical
feminist but believing in equal pay for equal work _ but then she
pauses, embarrassed, and gives a more personal response.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was raised by all women, and all women who had to make their
own way,'' she says. ``My mother was the angelic one, my aunt who
had ambition for me, and grandmother who was strict with me and
made me sit up straight.'' But she was also somewhat bound by the
rules of society: ``I was taught that you had to put on makeup and
attract men.''
</P>
<P>
   Her daughter Kimberly Kyser remembers describing her mother to
her friends as an early feminist. ``She gave us conflicted
messages, part traditional, part feminist. She's true to her
tradition, seeing the need for women's independence but being
conflicted.''
</P>
<P>
   Kyser's new-woman side shows in her enthusiasm for the college
degree she finally sought in the turbulent '60s. She started taking
classes, first as a hobby, then getting serious about it, and
finally earning a degree in art history in 1970. She likes to talk
about the politically charged environment of those times, which she
obviously relished. ``Going to the university at the time I did and
taking all those sociology classes _ when we broke up into
seminars, I was the only one who was older and had life
experiences.'' It awakened new ideas.
</P>
<P>
   She developed a strong interest in art, traveling to Greece and
Italy to see the classic works she learned about in class. She took
cooking lessons at Cordon Bleu. She discovered a taste for
art-house movies.
</P>
<P>
   It's been nearly 50 years of raising a family, of being a
leading citizen of Chapel Hill. Still, though, there's a nostalgia.
It was perhaps a bit harder for Georgia Kyser to leave the world of
celebrity than for her husband.
</P>
<P>
   ``He almost philosophically believed it was necessary to put
that part of his life behind him, and mother loved to show the
scrapbooks and tell us the stories about 21 (the famed New York
City restaurant),'' says Kimberly Kyser.
</P>
<P>
   Kay Kyser died in 1985. Since then, Georgia Kyser has pursued
her many interests, especially historic-building preservation. She
is the founder of the Preservation Society of Chapel Hill.
</P>
<P>
   As she tours the University of North Carolina campus, she points
to a building that she fears may get the wrecking ball. ``They
could at least leave the outside,'' she says indignantly. She's
working to make that happen.
</P>
<P>
   And she's certainly not blind to the coincidence of the
restoration work for the Women's Museum and her interest in
building preservation. Later, she pulls out a 1995 pamphlet listing
America's 11 Most Endangered Historic Places. One of the 11
listings is ``Fair Park's Texas Centennial Buildings.'' The Texas
Centennial Exposition, where she got her start.
</P>
<P>
   At 80, Kyser has been put back in the limelight by the Women's
Museum. And she's worked a little magic for one of the Centennial
Buildings without even lifting a lovely finger.
</P>
<P>
   Hidden hands.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   Who was the sculptor?
</P>
<P>
   The sculptor of ``Spirit of the Centennial,'' a
Botticelli-reminiscent creation of a nude woman rising up out of a
saguaro cactus, was a Frenchman-turned-Texan named Raoul Josset.
Josset specialized in monuments, and in addition to ``Spirit,''
created 20-foot-high statues honoring the United States, France and
Mexico for the Centennial Exhibition, according to The Lubbock
Avalanche-Journal. The Refugio Memorial to Captain King, the statue
at Washington on the Brazos, and the Goliad Memorial are also his
work. The ``Spirit of the Centennial'' is made of cast stone with
plaster and metal paintings and has a concrete pedestal. It took 10
days to complete.

   CUBA-EMBARGO-$ADV24 _ VARADERO, Cuba _ The U.S. Congress has
moved closer to easing the Cuban embargo, giving initial passage to
measures that would allow the sale of food and medicine to Cuba, as
well as a bill that would ease travel restrictions that currently
bar most U.S. citizens from visiting Cuba. If the latter measure
wins final approval, it could prove a bonanza for the Cuban tourism
industry, which has grown dramatically in the past decade.

But the land that once threatened us with Russian nukes has built

   CHINA-SEX _ BEIJING _ Prostitution is rampant in China. From the

the seediest roadside stalls, women are making a living with their
bodies. Experts say it is one of the major reasons for a
skyrocketing number of cases of syphilis, gonorrhea and other
sexually transmitted diseases (STDs). Although the government is
starting to recognize the seriousness of the problem, few believe
it will be brought under control anytime soon. With an ever-more
mobile population, a dismal level of sex education for young people
who are becoming increasingly sexually active and a sex industry
that is almost institutionalized, government efforts to limit the
spread of STDs seem like a drop in the bucket. (Chao, Cox News

   VOTERS-UNINFORMED _ WASHINGTON _ In a survey of college
freshean, the New York Times found ``a striking ingorance of even
the most elementary aspects'' of U.S. politics. The year was 1943.
More than half a century later, amid the ongoing information boom,
social scientists say little has changed. American voters are
disturbingly ignorant about the country's political life and its
leaders. Even in the age of radio talk shows and Internet chat, a
majority of Americans have trouble identifying their congressman or
naming specific policy details of the presidential candidates. A
look at the phenomenon and its impact of voter apathy and turnout.

   (For Atlanta) TECH-GADEL _ WASHINGTON _ As high-tech companies
mushroom, Georgia's old economy - largely built on peanuts, poultry
and pulp wood - is being transformed. The new foundation rests on
computer bits, bytes and biotech. While only about 4 percent of
Georgians are farmers today, about 7 percent are high-tech workers,
such as computer engineers and programmers. In metro Atlanta alone,
roughly 10,000 tech companies employ about 220,000 people. But
while the tech sector is driving up the state's population and
wealth, Georgia's 13-member delegation to Congress remains outside
the inner circles of tech political power. Though they won't speak
on the record, many of Georgia's business executives and lobbyists
grumble about their lawmakers' lackluster leadership on tech
issues. (Geewax, Cox News Service)

   FLIGHT-SERV _ When Todd Bottorff was brought in to help pull
Flightserv.com out of its dive in late May, he faced some
Internet-sized challenges. The Atlanta company's stock had dropped
90 percent from its 52-week high, after ranking as Georgia's
best-performing stock last year. A New York money manager had
cancelled the second half of a $10 million investment. Few business
travelers were using Flightserv's Web site, www.flightserv.com.,
which offers individual seats on private jet flights between
Atlanta and New York. And the company was running out of cash. So,
over the next several weeks, Flightserv's new president and chief
operating officer cut the staff and marketing budget and suspended
flights. Bottorff also plunged into retooling Flightserv's business
model and rounding up new investors and business partners.

West and the Dry Tortugas. You land there, you're in America.
You've succeeded, according to Bill Clinton's controversial wet
foot/dry foot Cuban Adjustment Act, in reaching our shores and
almost assuredly will not be repatriated. Therefore, more and more
are headed for the Marquesas as that is the shortest distance

against high odds, to stitch together the 270 electoral votes he
needs to win. (Glass), Cox News Service).

   SAVING-CAVES _ Rusty's Cave is as quiet as a tomb and as artful

is not well known, which has protected the formations growing from
the floor and the ceiling. They took thousands of years to form.
They can shatter in seconds. In the darkness, Diane Cousineau of
Lafayette and Bill Putnam of Lawrenceville murmur about enjoying
quiet moments in the cool embrace of the earth. ``You know how some
people are beautiful and stunning and others are just as plain as
plain can be?'' Cousineau says. ``Caves are like that too. Every
one is different.'' Putnam is a director the Atlanta-based
Southeastern Cave Conservancy Inc., which Cousineau chairs. For the
past several years, the 600-member organization has rapidly
acquired caverns from West Virginia to Florida both to hold and to
protect. Most are near Tennessee-Alabama-Georgia border, a region
with perhaps more caves per square mile than anywhere in the United
States. ``Land acquisition is our mission,'' says Cousineau. ``We
just need to go out and buy most of the Southeast. It's a modest
goal.'' (Visser, Atlanta Journal-Constitution) WITH PHOTOS

other big spenders who are helping to fund the effort, in a ``polio

   As the presidential campaign shifts into final gear, the new TV
season gets under way.
</P>
<P>
   You've probably noticed that summer rerun season has been
especially long this year _ an unhappy situation necessitated by
the late-arriving Summer Olympics. We've slogged through

writers and starring real actors.
</P>
<P>
   Much was written months ago about the absence of ``buzz'' around
the new TV season, but I think that may have had more to do with
the fact that previews arrived four months before the shows. Why
bother to buzz about something that's so far away? It's like trying
to get voters to pay attention to the November election before
Labor Day.
</P>
<P>
   As usual, a lot of new shows should be studiously ignored. Think
of them as fifth-party candidates. Some shows are worth a glance, a
few are promising and a handful are actually contenders. To help
you cast an educated vote in this fall's TV campaign, here's our
handy guide. Mark you ballots and set your VCRs. You want to be an
educated viewer/voter, don't you? And, as always, watch and debate
amongst yourselves.

</P>
<P>
   (WB, Oct. 8)
</P>
<P>
   A large cast of complete unknowns does over-the-top, frantically
paced sketch comedy. The presentation tape, which was not supposed
to be for review but is the only thing available, shows a
potentially sharp cast performing gross-out material that spoofs
pop culture. There's an emphasis on tasteless, off-color humor
geared to the younger-than-''Saturday Night Live'' set. And there's
an annoying overall hysteria in the air.

   This tacky new sitcom stars Nikki Cox's chest. Really. There's
no attempt to direct attention to dialogue or the situation or even
her pretty face. It's about her chest. She plays a Las Vegas dancer
married to a would-be wrestler. They're supposed to be funny
together. The wildly lame show comes from ``The Drew Carey Show''
creator Bruce Helford, who used to have talent.

   Here's a worn out premise: Two couples with different
child-rearing philosophies collide with allegedly hilarious
results. Kim hyperventilates when her baby refuses to stand up and
walk on time; her sister, Christine, however, barely notices when
her kids refuse to eat or when she runs over the neighbor's cat.
Har har. There's one funny scene in the pilot, a computerized
gimmick with Kim's baby.

   `Tucker'
</P>
<P>
   (NBC, Oct. 2)
</P>
<P>
   A grosser version of ``Malcolm in the Middle,'' this sitcom is
about a 14-year-old boy, winningly played by Eli Marienthal
(``American Pie''). When his parents get divorced, he and his
mother move into the crowded home of his crass aunt (Katey Sagal)
and her idiot son, Leon. Tucker's life is one big embarrassment,
from Leon's disgusting human hair collection to the aunt's
misbegotten conviction that he's trying to see her naked. The only
light in Tucker's life is the pretty girl next door. This show has
some funny moments, but it lacks the intelligence and innocence
that elevate ``Malcolm.''

   Oliver Platt is a refreshing addition to TV, and the
star-studded supporting cast of Dick Wolf's latest drama includes
Bebe Neuwirth, Tom Conti and Lili Taylor. But ... the pilot doesn't
do a good job of blending the newspaper and crime-fighting
elements. Platt plays Wallace Benton, a New York columnist (based
on Jimmy Breslin), who uses his enormous ego and a group of
journalism students to right wrongs and solve crimes. The pilot has
a truthful ring or two (such as Benton screaming at his computer),
but it also has Benton asking cops to leave so he can interrogate a
murder suspect. Wolf wouldn't go that far astray on the superior
``Law &AMP; Order.'' Grade: C

   Most TV critics hated this new high school drama _ which focuses
on the teachers rather than the students _ from David E. Kelley.
They said it was too sexual, too gross and too strange. Obviously
my colleagues haven't set foot in a high school in a long time. Chi
McBride holds things together as the intimidating but soft-hearted
principal, whose job is to deal with unruly students, burned-out
teachers and whining parents. Among the controversies dealt with in
the pilot: A teacher ends an affair with a student; a teacher
becomes the focus of an R-rated, student-produced computer cartoon;
and a teacher in charge of troubled students fires a gun in class
to get their attention. Irresponsible and illegal? Sure, and the
teacher will face repercussions. This isn't Kelley's best work, but
it's got a lot of potential.

   This concept has certainly been beaten to death _ four women

Promoted as an African American version of ``Sex and the City,''
it's not as R-rated or sex-obsessed. Kelsey Grammer is one of the

<P>
   Well, yuck. There's something creepy about a sexy woman prancing
undressed around the home of the man she's engaged to while her
future stepson, an impressionable 14-year-old, drools over her.
This alleged family sitcom, with strong elements of (you guessed
it) ``Sex and the City,'' stars Oscar-winner Davis as a New York
careerwoman who falls in love with a suburban widower (Peter
Horton). If there is a dram of chemistry between Davis and Horton,
it isn't evident in the pilot. Nor is there an ounce of humor _
unless you're sick enough to laugh at the adolescent's ogling.

   `Dark Angel'
</P>
<P>
   (Fox, Oct. 3)
</P>
<P>
   James Cameron's first TV series is about as buoyant as the
Titanic. Critical opinion on this dark sci-fi drama split along
gender lines: Men liked it, while most women did not. The
leather-clad heroine, played by Jessica Alba (``Never Been
Kissed''), probably has something to do with it. The lumbering
two-hour pilot bounces between flashbacks to a group of genetically
enhanced kids with bar codes on their necks and the now grown-up
superwoman Max, a weary warrior in a post-apocalyptic future. The
language is crude, the dialogue cheap: ``I would have come sooner,
but I didn't,'' Max mutters. It's a future without civility or,
apparently, shampoo. Max joins forces with a resistance journalist
to buck the bad guys, but their crusade makes no sense.

   At press time, there was still no pilot for the former
``Seinfeld'' star's latest outing. Scenes that were screened for
critics months ago, as well as promotional spots running on NBC
now, indicate that Richards is again playing Kramer. Now Jerry's
wacky neighbor is named Vic Nardozza and working as a bumbling
Hollywood detective. If enough of the spotlight is spread to the
impressive supporting cast (including Tim Meadows, William Devane
and Bill Cobbs), this one could be swell _ especially for
unrepentant lovers of physical comedy.

   Delta Burke as the first lady, and David Alan Grier as a Secret
Service agent demoted from protecting the president to guarding the
first lady. Concept: first rate. Stars: excellent. Execution: What
in the world went wrong? The pacing of the pilot is clumsy, with
odd spaces of dead air and characters, except for Agent Daggett,
that are not remotely entertaining. The first lady is mean-spirited
and superficial, her daughters are obnoxious and the president is
stupid. For this premise to work, somebody besides Dag has to be
sharp. The network is said to be tinkering with future episodes, so
there's a slender ray of hope.

<P>
   David Letterman's production company concocted this sitcom, and
the premise is vaguely autobiographical. Jim Gaffigan plays a
weatherman from Indiana who lands a job on a morning show in New
York where abrasive producer Christine Baranski rules the roost.
The stuffed-shirt anchorman, played by Rocky Carroll, instantly
feels threatened, much to Jim's surprise. Well-written with smart,
snappy dialogue, this one could click if the culture clash between
plain-spoken Midwesterner and sharp-barking New Yorkers stays on

   Yes, I'm ashamed that I kind of liked this new soap from Aaron
Spelling. Maybe it's just nostalgia for the days of ``Dallas'' and
``Dynasty,'' but I wasn't the only critic who hooted at Spelling's
spoof of his own favorite genre. Victoria Principal plays the sweet
matron in a divorced family headed by Perry King. The exes have two
hunky sons and two luscious daughters. The sons are vying for
control of the family business, and the daughters are in love with
the same man. One of the sons, woodenly played by flex-happy Casper
Van Dien, has a history with his father's new fiancee, played by
super-babe Yasmine Bleeth. A very campy guilty pleasure.

   Sex, power and money _ not necessarily in that order _ are the
focus of this fast-paced drama from Darren Star, creator of
``Melrose Place'' and ``Sex and the City.'' A group of fast-trading
hot shots decide to leave a prestigious Wall Street brokerage firm
and strike out on their own. Will they make it? Of course, the
question is what they'll do with the lucrative proceeds after
hours. Besides making money, these folks like to make whoopee,
occasionally under kinky conditions. The eclectic mix includes an
ambitious good guy, played by Tom Everett Scott; Adam Goldberg as
the kinky guy with an ironic detachment from work; Rick Hoffman as
a major sexist pig; and Jennifer Connelly as a hard-charging
executive. Fresh faces, fine potential.

In the pilot he bumps into people who look like clowns and gets

Amy Pietz; his freeloading buddy, played by Chris Elliott; and his
friendly co-worker, played by Wendell Pierce. Slotted Thursdays at

   This soft-focus, multigenerational family drama gets some heft
from classy Edward Hermann as (what else?) a stodgy, upper-crust
snob. But the heart of the show, which is sometimes a bit too
tender and precious, comes from the relationship between a
32-year-old single mother, played by Lauren Graham, and her
16-year-old daughter, winningly played by Alexis Bledel. To save
her daughter from the perils of an inner-city high school, the mom
decides to send her to an elite prep school. To pay for it,
however, she has to move home and sponge off her wealthy parents,
played by Hermann and Kelly Bishop. The concept is a bit strained,
but the relationships are worthwhile.

<P>
   BELTON _ Hours ago, when all was dark and still, the only noise
was the hum of the highway.
</P>
<P>
   Then Nancy stepped out the door with Chester the terrier, and
the gravel crunched under her feet. She ambled to the intersection
and turned right, away from the place reserved for the family from
Canada, down by the covered patio where the cowboys and cowgirls
from out in East Texas will drink some Coors and grill some chicken
and talk about some horses tonight. She passed the tree that holds
the iguana that came from the carnival that was here. She passed
the tiny pool. Those inflatable porpoises weren't there. Yet.
</P>
<P>
   Good morning, Nancy said.
</P>
<P>
   Morning, Nancy.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone knows Nancy Adams. She's been here since the early days
of June.
</P>
<P>
   Nancy's husband died in the spring, and she had nowhere to go,
so now she lives in a 35-foot-long travel trailer with an
expandable living room and 100 channels of satellite TV. It's a
Holiday Rambler Imperial with oak interior trim. Chester sleeps
with her on the queen bed. Nancy loves it at the
Belton/Temple/Killeen KOA, the only Kampground of America between
San Antonio and Waco, the great American way station for travelers
on their adventures from here to there.
</P>
<P>
   Why wouldn't she? There's a laundry room with 50-cent dryers.
Mail service. Shade trees. A KOA convenience store and a horseshoe
pit and complimentary coffee. Chester _ any dog _ is welcome. Nancy
pays $240 a month in rent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've homesteaded,'' she says with a playful snicker.
</P>
<P>
   Ask her about the people she's met. She'll go on and on and on.
Most of them, she's liked.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a terrible thing to say, but if you do get pissed at your
neighbors, you pick up and move on,'' Nancy says.
</P>
<P>
   She laughs loudly. She's not kidding. ``You can't do that if you
buy a house.''
</P>
<P>
   So here she is.
</P>
<P>
   It's a scalding Saturday in September, and she's sitting at a
picnic table, waiting for it all.
</P>
<P>
   Any minute now. They'll be coming up the road any minute now.
</P>
<P>
   Look.
</P>
<P>
   There they are.
</P>
<P>
   Vets, cowboys, widows
</P>
<P>
   The two pickups wear Oregon plates. One is pulling a long travel
trailer.
</P>
<P>
   Wayne Crathers. the KOA maintenance man, has to trim branches
from a tree so the trailer can fit into space D12.
</P>
<P>
   ``Boy,'' says campground owner Alice Oltmer. ``These big rigs
are somethin' else.''
</P>
<P>
   Alice never gets over just how big they are. When her parents
bought this campground in 1976, the big rigs were smaller, and none
of them had expandable living rooms or 100-channel satellite
service. None of them had data ports for laptop computers, either,
but these days data ports are important, so Alice installed one in
the KOA office so the guests could tap into the Internet while
their laundry is drying in the next room.
</P>
<P>
   ``We kind of spoil our people,'' Alice says.
</P>
<P>
   Alice and her business partner bought the campground from her
parents in 1997. Her partner lives in Indiana, so when someone
wants to stay in one of the 100 spaces at the KOA, Alice usually is
the one who takes care of it.
</P>
<P>
   Today, most of the spaces are reserved. It's the day of the
first football game for the University of Texas, and there's a
cutting-horse show in town, and about a third of the spaces are
occupied by people such as Nancy Adams, people who live here all
the time.
</P>
<P>
   There's a veterinarian. A writer of police stories. Contractors.
Nurses. Widows.
</P>
<P>
   The two trucks with Oregon plates carry a family of four from
Canada.
</P>
<P>
   The Fairs . Harlon and Renell and the kids. They have not been
home in five years.
</P>
<P>
   Their 38-foot travel trailer is home and school for
the8-year-old Justin Fair and his brother Colter, 4. Their mother
home-schools them while their father digs trenches for fiber-optic
cable.
</P>
<P>
   The Fairs started out in Washington, then went to Oregon, then
to Nevada, then to San Angelo. ``And now, here,'' Renell Fair says,
and she sighs.
</P>
<P>
   There is much to do. Her husband unhooks the trailer. The boys
play tag and scrape around in the rocks for fossils. Renell fetches
water thefor the dog, El Paso. She figures they'll be here for two
months or so. Right here in space D12 at the KOA of cCentral Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a long way from home,'' Renell says. ``I keep reminding
myself: There are worse situations.''
</P>
<P>
   Amenities abound
</P>
<P>
   Hear that?
</P>
<P>
   That rattle? Like a marble in a spraypaint can.
</P>
<P>
   That's the sound of a diesel engine, and it means more guests
are on the way. Enormous trucks hauling enormous travel trailers
across enormous Texas. Finding exit 292 on Interstate 35 between
Waco and Austin.
</P>
<P>
   The red and yellow and black sign.
</P>
<P>
   The KOA.
</P>
<P>
   The first Kampground of America was a cinderblock restroom near
the Yellowstone River in Billings, Mont.
</P>
<P>
   That was 38 years ago. The idea caught fire like Sterno: bBy the
mid-1980s, there were more than 800 KOAs.
</P>
<P>
   There are 495 now. The value of land goes up; the KOAs get sold.
But the best survive.
</P>
<P>
   In the Florida Keys, a KOA has its own golf course. The KOA in
Port Huron, Mich., has its own train.
</P>
<P>
   The KOA in WndoverWendover, Nev., features slot machines and
video poker. The one in San Francisco has a petting zoo. In
Jamestown, N.D., campers _ kampers? _ find themselves near the home
of Louis L'Amour and ``the world's largest buffalo,'' according to
the KOA directory. In Hayward, Wis., there's the lumberjack
competition. In Steamboat Springs, Colo., there are weekend
bonfires and balloon rides.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'd be surprised what you find,'' says KOA communications
director Michael Smith , who answers the telephone this way: ``It's
a great day at KOA.''
</P>
<P>
   It is, as a matter of fact, a great day at our KOA in Belton.
</P>
<P>
   The sun is setting, pulling the temperature down with it. People
are riding bikes, walking dogs, floating in the pool on the
inflatable porpoises that are there for the guests. Smoke rises
from someone's grill.
</P>
<P>
   The cowboys and cowgirls are cooking up some chicken for dinner.
</P>
<P>
   They're here for the cutting-horse competition, like a rodeo for
quarter horses trained to separate a steer from a herd. They came
from East Texas, from places called Cleveland and Conroe and Winnie
and Weatherford.
</P>
<P>
   The cutting horses are in their stalls. The competition begins
on Monday, two days away. The Longhorns won this afternoon. So did
the Aggies. ``God Bless Texas'' is on the radio. Everyone's here,
their trailers are hooked up, and their chicken is sizzling on the
barbecue pit.
</P>
<P>
   So tonight they celebrate.
</P>
<P>
   There is plenty of cause. Terry Jones, a cowboy from Conroe,
will be honored at the end of the cutting-horse competition for
winning the season championship. He's been gone from home almost
every weekend this year, hauling horses from show to show.
</P>
<P>
   Terry says he used to spend $800 a month on hotels. Now he
sleeps in the front of his Featherlite horse trailer, which
resembles an apartment but smells of hay. ``I don't know how I made
it without it,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Terry and his fiance, Jennifer Mushinski , booked this spot as
soon as they knew they were coming. The arena is over the hill.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got water. We've got electricity. We're right here,'' he
says.
</P>
<P>
   And then there's this: Terry, 34, has a special kinship with
KOA. He was conceived at one, he swears, in Lake Tahoe, Nev.
</P>
<P>
   It's dark now, and the cowboys and cowgirls have been through
some Coors, so everyone gets a chuckle out of Terry's claim. The
laughter sweeps through the campground, and Alice Oltmer, the
owner, comes outside from the store.
</P>
<P>
   ``Quiet hours,'' she says quietly. It's after 10 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   ``No problem,'' says Terry.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well guys _ have fun.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll see you in the morning.''
</P>
<P>
   ``GoodnightGood night.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, much later, the campground is still again. The East Texas
cowboys and cowgirls are in bed. So is the new family from Canada.
So is Alice. So is Nancy Adams, and so is Chester, and so areis the
rest of the guests of the KOA.
</P>
<P>
   The only noise now is the hum of the traffic, the drone of tires
on the road.

   OLY-ARCH-ABORIGINES _ SYDNEY _ A column on Aborigines, their
story, life, &AMP; protest. Aboriginal leaders have warned of violent
protests at the Sydney Olympics because of a government report that
plays down the harm caused by a longtime policy of taking
Aboriginal children from their families. For months, Aboriginal
protesters have said they would use the Sept. 15-Oct. 1 Olympics
and the intense media attention the games generate to highlight the
plight of their people. The previously conciliatory mood evaporated
recently following revelations that the government believes
accounts of the estimated 100,000 Aboriginal children taken by
authorities between 1910 and the 1970s - known as the stolen
generation'' - were exaggerated. Column will focus on Cathy
Freeman, the first Aboriginal woman to win a gold medal. Freeman
will compete Friday. (Archdeacon, Dayton Daily News). 40.

 &HT;    EDS. FOR SUNDAY EDITIONS
 &HT;    Manufacturers hoping e-dogs are the next fad
 &HT;    By James Cummings
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Electronic puppies won't shed, won't bite, won't chase cars and
if you forget to take them out for a walk they won't do anything
unpleasant on the floor.
</P>
<P>
   Several toy makers apparently think interactive electronic
puppies are going to be the next big fad for kids, and they've
rushed quite a few models onto toy department shelves this year.
</P>
<P>
   One of them is Poo-Chi from Tiger Electronics Ltd., who had a
big hit with Furby a couple years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Poo-Chi, about 6 inches tall, is small enough to fit in the palm
of an adult's hand. It's advertised for children 4 and older, but
children younger than about 7 probably will need help getting the
puppy to perform.
</P>
<P>
   Poo-Chi barks and pants in response to input to its sensors _ a
touch pad on his head and light and sound sensors and, apparently,
a magnetic sensor on his snout. When the dog is sitting quietly,
touching his head may make him stand and bark, for example.
</P>
<P>
   The toy comes with a plastic bone that seems to have a weak
magnet inside. Hold the bone in front of the dog's nose, and his
mouth opens and closes while the dog makes eating noises.
</P>
<P>
   Poo-Chi's emotional state is indicated by his lighted eyes. If
the dog is happy, his eyes are shaped like large hearts. Small
half-moons mean Poo-Chi is sad. Tiger Toys says the dog has a
``biorhythm program,'' and sometimes he'll be in an especially good
mood and sometimes he'll be mostly sad and lethargic.
</P>
<P>
   As electronic pets go, Poo-Chi is fairly unsophisticated. He
barks, pants, pretends to eat, sit, stands, sleeps and sings
several songs while dancing on his toes. Put two Poo-Chis together
and they interact with one another.
</P>
<P>
   The toy doesn't walk or learn like some electronic dogs, but at
only about $30 it's a cute toy for a small child. Learn more at
www.tigertoys.com.
</P>
<P>
   An older child might prefer Tekno, a robotic puppy from Manley
Toy Quest. (Visit www.tekno-robot.com) Tekno, which sells for about
$45, walks and can be taught tricks.
</P>
<P>
   The most amazing electronic puppy is AIBO (www.aibosite
</P>
<P>
   .com), which Sony sold last fall and this spring. AIBO interacts
independently with its environment doing things like chasing and
kicking its own ball and picking up objects in its mouth.
</P>
<P>
   But at $2,500 per unit, AIBO definitely is not a stocking
stuffer.

 &HT;    Toastmasters offers training ground for public speaking
 &HT;    By Sharon Sullivan
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GRAND JUNCTION, Colo. _It's early Tuesday morning and members of
Grand Junction Toastmasters are sitting around a table in a back
room at Common Grounds coffeehouse, 1230 N. 12th St.
</P>
<P>
   Some are drinking coffee, hoping to wake up fully before having
to speak. Palangat Velayudhan, who goes by Vela, loosens everyone
up with a bit of humor. His job today as Jokemaster comes
naturally.
</P>
<P>
   Then they move on to Table Topics _ a thinking-on-your-feet
public speaking exercise.
</P>
<P>
   The word of the day is copious, which means abundant, plentiful,
in great quantities. Three to four people get called upon to speak
for 1 to 2 minutes, using the word of the day.
</P>
<P>
   New member Paul Harshman uses his turn to talk about the
``copious'' information he gathered while attending the Denver
Green Party Convention, during which Ralph Nader was nominated for
presidential candidate.
</P>
<P>
   He's pretty fired up about his experience in Denver and getting
to hobnob with Nader supporters Jim Hightower, author and activist,
and Granny D, the 90-year-old great-grandmother who walked 3,200
miles across the United States advocating campaign finance reform.
</P>
<P>
   Harshman may have been in the minority for his political views,
but he was voted best Table Topics that day, anyway. He told an
engaging story in 2 minutes on a moment's notice.
</P>
<P>
   Toastmasters clubs are open to anyone wanting to improve formal
public speaking, individual communications, impromptu situations
and leadership skills.
</P>
<P>
   Members participate in a self-paced, focused speaking program.
Founder of Toastmasters, Dr. Ralph Smedley, formed the first club
on Oct. 22, 1924, with a group of men in Santa Ana, Calif., with
the purpose ``to afford practice and training in the art of public
speaking and in presiding over meetings, and to promote sociability
and good fellowship among its members.''
</P>
<P>
   Gradually, other clubs in other cities and countries were
formed, and in 1973, Toastmasters International club membership was
opened to women. Today there are more than 8,000 clubs with more
than 180,000 members from all over the world in the nonprofit
organization.
</P>
<P>
   ``It certainly draws people who want to be successful and are
interested in wanting to make their life and career grow,'' said
Barry Moore, area governor of Toastmasters for the Western Slope.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anybody who has a desire and a dream is going to have to
present themselves to the public. Table Topics in Toastmasters is
the way to prepare themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   At the Grand Junction Toastmasters club you'll meet the ardent
Republican and the avid Green and everyone in-between, people of
all professions, philosophies and lifestyles. The most senior
member is 87 years old. The youngest is 26 and is as casual as the
other is formal.
</P>
<P>
   There are generally two 5- to 7-minute speeches at each weekly
meeting on topics as diverse as the members themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``One thing I love about our club, there's a real variety of
ages, experiences, political affiliations and knowledge,'' said
Kasey Conway, who has been a Toastmaster for about a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``For example, we have a conservative ex-uranium mining engineer
and I'm a liberal Democrat environmentalist. I think our
Toastmasters club is exciting because you can talk about the
different perspectives on an issue and actually give a speech about
it. It stimulates intellectual thinking.
</P>
<P>
   ``In our club we have some polarized ideas and that's one of the
great things about our club. You learn to listen and evaluate ideas
even though they may be 180 degrees from where you're coming
from.''
</P>
<P>
   Not all speeches are political. In fact, most are not. People
speak about what they know about and are interested in. Kim Bridge,
34, likes to speak about family issues, drawing on her experiences
as a mother. ``I was home with my kids all the time. I'd become a
recluse. Getting into Toastmasters gave me the confidence to get
back out in the workforce,'' Bridge said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no pressure. You just go and speak and get critiqued
but it's done in such a positive way. It makes you want to do
better and expand on your speeches, at least it did for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Roles at the meetings rotate each week. There are people giving
prepared speeches, someone assigned to give the joke of the day,
speech evaluators and Toastmaster of the week, who leads the
meetings.
</P>
<P>
   ``The leadership skills you gain from running the meeting _ that
also helps out in the workforce,'' Bridge said. ``It helps to have
that experience behind you.''
</P>
<P>
   Some employers will pay for their employees to join. There is a
one-time fee of $36 and dues are $40 for six months.
</P>
<P>
   When a Toastmaster has the job of evaluator, he or she stands up
and gives a 2-minute oral evaluation of one of the speeches given
that day. ``One of the goals that has emerged from my experience is
the development of my evaluation skills, listening to what people
are saying,'' Conway said. ``You learn to be diplomatic, to say
what you mean, mean what you say, but say it in a way that doesn't
destroy but encourages them. I think that's a tremendous benefit.''
</P>
<P>
   Vela came to the United States from India 25 years ago. ``I'm a
single full-custodial parent,'' Vela said. ``I wanted to convince
the courts to give fathers equal treatment in terms of giving them
either full or joint custody during divorce. That's one of the main
reasons I joined Toastmasters, and so I could talk to fathers'
groups about the important role they play in the lives of their
children.
</P>
<P>
   ``Toastmasters also helped me a lot in my graduate courses. I
was able to talk off the cuff anytime I wanted to.''
</P>
<P>
   At 87 years old, Bob Sayre is the most senior and longest
standing member of Grand Junction Toastmasters, which was charted
in 1954. ``It's a challenge even when you've been in for 40-some
years,'' he said. ``When you get to be 87 years old, there's a
tendency to just stay at home or travel if they have the money. To
me it's a challenge to still get up there and make a talk that has
a point.''
</P>
<P>
   Sayre said he is still not running out of ideas to talk about.
``It helps to have a globe-trotting life,'' he said. ``Subjects
keep coming up that need to be covered.''
</P>
<P>
   His wife Bonney attends. She often wins at Table Topics.
</P>
<P>
   Loyd Carlson, a retired geologist, has been in Toastmasters
since 1986 and doesn't lack for ideas either. ``There's always
something new to come up with.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Loyd and I are geologists and engineers,'' Sayre said. ``We've
sat through literally hundreds of awful speeches at professional
conventions on technical subjects _ speeches that were worthless.
They know their geology but they get up there and mumble about.
It's terrible. And you sit there and think `Gosh that guy needs
Toastmasters.'''
</P>
<P>
   Speeches can be serious, humorous, personal or professional. New
members receive a manual that guides them on various aspects of
speaking such as vocal variety, using visual aids or adding impact
to a speech.
</P>
<P>
   The youngest member of Grand Junction Toastmasters, 26-year-old
Justin Monroe, said he uses what he has learned at Toastmasters
every day. ``I used to get really nervous if I had to talk about a
specific topic,'' Monroe said. ``Already in just the last three
months I can tell I'm much more calm. The cold sweats don't come
over me, the hands aren't as shaky as they were.''
</P>
<P>
   Another member, Dorothy McNeese, has worked in environmental
restoration and is finishing up a degree in that field. She saw an
opportunity to improve her abilities with Toastmasters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a need to speak more confidently, to do the things I
want to do,'' McNeese said. ``There are a lot of diverse people in
our club, different philosophies, yet when we come together at
Toastmasters there is this central goal to learn to speak better. I
like the way I see people who are total opposites yet have respect
for each other.''

 &HT;    Can't I just do a book report?
 &HT;    By Sharon Sullivan
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GRAND JUNCTION, Colo. _ My friend Diana laughs when she thinks
about me being in Toastmasters.
</P>
<P>
   People tend to view me as a down-to-earth, laid-back sort of
person. Diana had an impression that Toastmasters were conservative
old businessmen all dressed in suits _a common misconception it
seems. Actually all kinds of people join Toastmasters. Sometimes
the only thing they have in common is a desire to speak better.
</P>
<P>
   I was browsing through the newspaper one day when a small ad
caught my eye. ``Speechcraft,'' an eight-week speech class, was
being sponsored by Toastmasters. It was one of those moments when I
knew in an instant that this was something I wanted and needed to
do. No hesitation, no thinking about it, I just signed up.
</P>
<P>
   It's not that I enjoy getting up in front of a group and
speaking. Quite the contrary. I was always one of those kids who
would opt for a written book report over an oral one any day. Yet,
at 43, I'm a teacher. I teach small groups of pregnant couples
preparation for childbirth. I love the subject and am comfortable
in front of my small groups. But I figured the speech class could
help me polish my presentation skills.
</P>
<P>
   Our class of eight students learned the first night we'd each be
doing a 5- to 7-minute speech for the next seven classes. It was a
challenge, and slightly terrifying, but turned out to be exciting
and even fun. We all admitted to each other how we'd come home
after class totally energized. I liked it so much, in fact, I went
on to join Grand Junction Toastmasters even though they meet at
6:45 a.m. I used to hate to talk on the phone before 9 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   But I go most every Tuesday morning to Common Grounds
Coffeehouse, where we meet, and it's definitely been worth it. I'm
back home by 8 a.m. and feel like I've already accomplished a lot
that day.
</P>
<P>
   I still get nervous when it's my turn to do a speech.
Practically everyone does. But I can do it now. I stand up in front
of my fellow Toastmasters and speak about things that are dear to
my own heart. I've had fun talking about things and issues I think
people should know about _ like Grand Junction's new community
radio station, the joy of contra dancing and the benefits of
carrying your baby on your body with a sling. I've been an advocate
for recycling and for the closing of the School of the Americas.
It's practicing and it's real at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   I've learned a lot about myself, where I'm strong and where I
need to improve. Meeting a group of people I wouldn't normally
cross paths with has been an added benefit. I love the people and
all the speeches I get to listen to.
</P>
<P>
   Toastmasters is a real exercise for the mind. I only wish I'd
joined 20 years ago.

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Tropical storm Helene, which formed Thursday in the eastern Gulf
of Mexico, will weaken as it moves inland early Friday.
Nevertheless, heavy rain will fall near the low-pressure center as
it moves northeast across eastern Alabama and Georgia. Wind gusts
over 40 mph will occur at exposed coastal locations of the western
panhandle of Florida early Friday, but gusty winds will diminish as
the storm moves inland. Rain from the remnants of the storm will
spread into the Carolinas later Friday and Friday night. Meanwhile,
a separate cluster of tropical showers will dampen the lower
Mississippi Valley.
</P>
<P>
   Locally heavy snow will fall in the mountains of northern
Wyoming as wintry air spills over the northern Rockies. Farther
east, a cool rain will fall from the eastern Dakotas to the
northern Mississippi Valley.
</P>
<P>
   FOCUS: AUTUMN BEGINS
</P>
<P>
   The arrival of fall at precisely 1:27 p.m. EDT on Friday means
little meteorologically. But in the weeks ahead, as solar rays
become less direct in the northern hemisphere the weather will
surely respond. The sun does not heat the atmosphere directly
because the envelope of air is mainly transparent to its
high-energy radiation. The earth absorbs much of the sun's energy.
Lower energy radiation from the ground then heats the atmosphere
from below. In the weeks ahead, the diminishing solar energy
received at the ground will lead inevitably to a chilling of the
atmosphere above.

REAL GOODS EXECUTIVES CUT OWN JOBS 
</HEADLINE>
   By ERIN ALLDAY   
 Santa Rosa (Calif.) Press Democrat   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTA ROSA, Calif. _ The two highest-ranking executives at the
eco-retailer Real Goods Trading Corp. are quitting in an effort to
help the company reduce costs and recover from last year's losses
and flat sales.
</P>
<P>
   The plan is to cut costs at the executive level, freeing more
cash to invest in sales strategies for the company's Web site,
retail stores and catalogs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our infrastructure was too large for our sales level, so we
needed to cut expenses down to what's more appropriate,'' said Real
Goods founder John Schaeffer, who served as company president until
May 1998 and will take that job again under the reorganization.
``I'm looking forward to getting more hands-on. I'm back in the
saddle.''
</P>
<P>
   The two departing executives, company president Mark Swedlund
and chief financial officer Les Seely, decided about three months
ago to leave by Sept. 30 in order to cut costs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been basically trying to get the company turned around,
and sales have been weak the first quarter, so we feel we've done
what we can do and there need to be some changes,'' Seely said.
``So we cut ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Real Goods, which was founded in 1978, specializes in renewable
energy products, including energy-saving light bulbs,
environment-friendly baby clothes and composting supplies.
</P>
<P>
   Sales come from its Web site, catalogs and four retail stores.
</P>
<P>
   The company reported a loss of $1.3 million for the fiscal year
ending March 31. In 1999, Real Goods posted a net loss of $482,000.
In the quarter ending June 2000, the company reported losses of
$520,000, compared with $140,000 the previous year.
</P>
<P>
   Sales in the past fiscal year grew just 1 percent to $19
million. Sales in the quarter ending in June were $3.2 million,
down from $4.1 million in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The company attributed the losses to several factors, including
one-time costs of moving the company to Santa Rosa from Ukiah,
expenses from revamping its Web site and a drop in the sales of
renewable energy products when the millennium scare faded.
</P>
<P>
   Schaeffer said the company is prepared to turn around,
especially as Americans face more worries about energy sources.
</P>
<P>
   Between soaring electric costs from energy deregulation and
record-high gasoline prices, Schaeffer said more people are
starting to think seriously about renewable energy products.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've put a lot of emphasis into merchandising,'' Schaeffer
said. ``There's a lot of really positive factors going for us.''

   SYDNEY _ Jenny Thompson was the last swimmer to climb out of the
pool
</P>
<P>
   following Thursday's 100-meter Olympic freestyle. While others
hurried
</P>
<P>
   on deck to wave at friends and family in the Aquatic Center
crowd, the
</P>
<P>
   most decorated female athlete in U.S. Olympic history wondered
just what
</P>
<P>
   she was supposed to do with a bronze medal from the final
individual
</P>
<P>
   event of her career, a bronze medal that she has to share with a
</P>
<P>
   longtime U.S. rival who touched the wall at precisely the same
instant.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's time for me to stop looking at what I don't have and look
at
</P>
<P>
   what I have,'' said Thompson, who's won seven gold medals on
Olympic
</P>
<P>
   relay teams dating to the 1992 Barcelona Games but never won an
Olympic
</P>
<P>
   race as an individual. ``I have more medals than any other
American
</P>
<P>
   female athlete. That's something to hang my hat on, at least.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. coach Richard Quick, who trains both Thompson and Dara
Torres at
</P>
<P>
   Stanford, must have given her a pep talk much like that. A year
ago
</P>
<P>
   Thompson looked like a lock for Olympic glory, breaking Mary T.
</P>
<P>
   Meagher's 18-year-old record in the 100-meter butterfly and
doing it in
</P>
<P>
   Australia at the Pan Pacifics.
</P>
<P>
   Yet when the Olympic cycle came around at Sydney, Dutch star
Inge de
</P>
<P>
   Bruijn took the gold in Thompson's two specialty events . What's
more,
</P>
<P>
   Thompson had to share the bronze medal platform with Torres, a
four-time
</P>
<P>
   Olympian who spent seven years away from the sport before
returning to
</P>
<P>
   the pool in July of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they were in two different places on the medal
stand,'' said
</P>
<P>
   Quick, who had to schedule Thompson and Torres for two different
</P>
<P>
   training times a few months ago because the intensity of their
</P>
<P>
   competition was becoming a distraction for both during practice
swims.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dara was celebrating because she's won her second individual
medal in
</P>
<P>
   this Olympic competition and she was feeling good about that,
plus she
</P>
<P>
   also has another chance in the 50 free. Jenny had just swam her
last
</P>
<P>
   individual race at the Olympics. There was a goal that she set
that she
</P>
<P>
   didn't accomplish. Maybe she was a little subdued because of
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Torres and Thompson touched in 54.43 seconds, close behind
</P>
<P>
   Sweden's Therese Alshammar but six-tenths of a second behind de
Bruijn.
</P>
<P>
   Torres, a former University of Florida swimmer, walked past
reporters at
</P>
<P>
   poolside with a smile and a breezy comment about the dead heat
for third
</P>
<P>
   place, saying, ``That's irony for you.''
</P>
<P>
   Thompson, whose two relay-team wins pushed her past speedskater
Bonnie
</P>
<P>
   Blair on the all-time U.S. gold medal list, spoke later at the
interview
</P>
<P>
   room but didn't stay long once Torres joined her at the table.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to say we had a conflict,'' Thompson said of her
</P>
<P>
   relationship with Torres. ``We shared a coach and a team. She's
a
</P>
<P>
   tremendous athlete and competitor.''
</P>
<P>
   Torres, who has worked on television for The Discovery Channel
and
</P>
<P>
   done some modeling, said the awards ceremony may have been
awkward, but
</P>
<P>
   only because of the logistics.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know what to do,'' she said. ``Did I go up first (on
the
</P>
<P>
   bronze-medal stand) or did she go up? Should we hug or should we
not
</P>
<P>
   hug? She was looking at her family and appreciating them and I
was
</P>
<P>
   enjoying having another medal.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's tough to see her try one last time and not be able to get
it.
</P>
<P>
   She has tons of other things to be proud of. She's had an
awesome
</P>
<P>
   career.''
</P>
<P>
   Thompson, meanwhile, can only replay her last few minutes in the
pool,
</P>
<P>
   staring at a scoreboard that showed de Bruijn the gold medalist.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just taking a deep breath after a hard race,'' said
Thompson,
</P>
<P>
   ``just soaking it in. It takes a while to figure it out, to
figure out
</P>
<P>
   what happened.''

A SONIC BOOM OF HIP-HOP 
</HEADLINE>
   By JON PARELES  (Critics Notebook) 
(See also HIP-HOP-EXHIBIT) 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Hip-hop wasn't meant to stand still, not even for a museum show.
In a little more than two decades it has transformed itself from
block-party entertainment in the South Bronx to an international
sonic and visual language. It mutates faster than any other
cultural form, going through a generation within months; it has
sent tendrils into film, fashion, television and advertising while
transforming the English language. Hip-hop defines a generation gap
in popular culture and creates entertainingly contentious
misunderstandings from all quarters. And it eludes any attempts at
prediction or control.
</P>
<P>
   Now museums are trying to get a handle on it. Both the Rock and
Roll Hall of Fame and Museum in Cleveland and its new rival, the
Experience Music Project in Seattle, have mounted exhibitions on
hip-hop. New York, where hip-hop was born, deserves a hip-hop
survey, and the Brooklyn Museum has remounted and slightly expanded
the Hall of Fame's exhibition, ``Hip-Hop Nation: Roots, Rhymes and
Rage.'' It's a necessarily incomplete introduction to hip-hop,
depending for its visual impact on memorabilia: posters, magazines,
album covers, documents, lyric sheets and, most of all, clothing,
from sneakers and gold jewelry to spangled jumpsuits. Tied to
artifacts, the show illuminates some parts of the story and misses
others. Like other Rock and Roll Hall of Fame shows, it tends to
let the costumes overwhelm the music. Yet the sheer familiarity of
all the baggy silhouettes underscores how hip-hop's visual style
has triumphed.
</P>
<P>
   Although ``Hip-Hop Nation'' is now in a museum with an extensive
collection of African art, it doesn't establish any connections
with the music's unmistakable ancestry, which is doubtless the
result of importing another museum's show. Yet hip-hop didn't
invent flashy gold jewelry, ceremonial hair styles or oral history
in musical form, all of which have ancient West African
antecedents. The hip-hop exhibition also shares one of the overall
challenges of exhibiting African art: Many of the objects were
meant to be seen in motion during a celebration, not in a vitrine.
A few video setups only partly relieve the static nature of the
exhibition.
</P>
<P>
   From the start the exhibition wisely establishes that rap is not
the totality of hip-hop; it's just the most easily commercialized
commodity. Hip-hop began as a way for poor and disenfranchised
youth to make public spaces their own: visually with graffiti,
kinetically with break-dancing, aurally with disc-jockeying and
verbally with emceeing, which put a personal message into the
instrumental spaces of well-known songs. Party chants by MCs
rapidly evolved into rappers' boasts, stories and free-form rhymes,
while DJs became quick-cutting turntable virtuosos. The rest is a
popular-music revolution.
</P>
<P>
   The exhibition races through hip-hop's tangled chronology,
touching on some salient topics including the block-party origins
of hip-hop and controversies over inflammatory lyrics. Trying to
cover broad issues in limited space, however, it grows sketchy. For
instance, a section on regionalism, which notes the expansion of
hip-hop beyond the coasts, could have used a map or a timeline and
looked at places outside the United States. The show is also at the
mercy of its lenders, leading to odd emphases; Vanilla Ice, the
white rapper who is now a punch line, stakes out territory with
three spangled outfits.
</P>
<P>
   The main sponsor of the show is Def Jam Records, which, luckily,
has been an important hip-hop label since the mid-1980s. So a
plethora of Def Jam memorabilia, especially from Public Enemy, is
more or less defensible, and Def Jam doesn't shut out its
competition. Tommy Boy Records is also well represented, and there
are shrines with stage wear and lyrics from the Notorious B.I.G.
and Tupac Shakur, two million-selling homicide victims of 1990s
rock. N.W.A., the Southern California group that put gangsta rap
into million-selling circulation, also gets some wall space, though
one of the most influential 1990s acts, the Wu-Tang Clan, is
represented only by its Wu Wear spinoff.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the computer monitor that greets visitors with the
Web page www.360hiphop.com _ the site run by Def Jam's owner,
Russell Simmons _ has animated photographs of graffitied subway
trains as its saving grace.
</P>
<P>
   For those who associate graffiti only with marker-pen vandalism,
the show's introductory room is a corrective. It's a memorial to
the short-lived era when graffiti artists risked arrest and injury
to turn subway cars into giant rolling murals, earning nothing
beyond a citywide ego trip. While most of the work was scrubbed off
or painted over, surviving only in photographs, the show's
subway-car door by Michael Tracy, with abstract multicolored dots
bubbling up, offers a close-up glimpse of an artist's elaborate
effort.
</P>
<P>
   Except for its video presentations, the exhibition is short on
context. It traces rappers' verbal gymnastics to the be-bop jive
talk of Cab Calloway and Dizzy Gillespie, which is true as far as
it goes. But it skips other obvious roots of hip-hop's verbal
dexterity: gospel preaching, ribald party-record comedy, the
rhyming insults called ``the dozens,'' the pimp and gangster
stereotypes of blaxploitation movies and the Jamaican tradition of
dance hall DJs toasting, or rhyming, over records. (The pioneering
hip-hop artist Kool D.J. Herc was born in Jamaica.)
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, a case full of the New York City Breakers'
memorabilia misses the chance to link breakdancing to
African-diaspora styles from the Lindy Hop to capoeira, the
Brazilian martial art.
</P>
<P>
   Still, many artifacts carry their own stories. A wall of 80
handbills _ many of them handdrawn and handlettered _ fondly evokes
the late-1970s moment when hip-hop was just a neighborhood event,
long before corporate logos and computer graphics took over the
iconography. The DJ Grandmaster Flash's worn-out copies of a Bob
James album, tucked away near the floor of one case, and the
Notorious B.I.G.'s collection of 45-rpm singles demonstrate that
scratching, the DJs' percussive innovation, definitely made
scratches.
</P>
<P>
   Yet from there the music of hip-hop is almost taken for granted.
There are lyrics from Public Enemy, Ice-T and Arrested Development,
but there's no hint of the relentless one-upmanship of hip-hop
producers devising sounds to leap out of boom-boxes: no production
logs, no beat-up drum machines. Hip-hop's use of sampled parts from
older songs _ an aesthetic and legal battleground for ideas about
pastiche, originality and fair use _ has shaken up artistic
thinking worldwide, but doesn't reach the exhibition. There's also
no mention of the way hip-hop transformed rhythm and blues, rock
and even teenypop in the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   But there's plenty of fashion. The latter part of the exhibition
is long on logos and, again, limited in context. While a video
mentions that expensive designer brands became inner-city status
symbols, there's little examination of what the flashy, oversize
clothes are trying to convey. Hip-hop grew up in the music-video
era and image is essential to hip-hop glory; it's defined by a
synergy of boastful rhymes, sonic impact, wardrobe and often
videoclip fantasies. A museum could build a fascinating full-scale
exhibition around changing notions of realism, power and pleasure
in hip-hop.
</P>
<P>
   Trying to touch all bases, ``Hip-Hop Nation: Roots, Rhymes and
Rage'' spreads itself thin. But it does hold hip-hop still long
enough to present at least a glimpse of where it's been. It's a
first step for a museum examination of hip-hop, not the last word.

   GORE-OIL (Hollywood, Md.) _ With an eye on a politically
disastrous increase in oil prices, Vice President Al Gore on
Thursday reversed himself and recommended that President Clinton
approve oil releases from the nation's strategic petroleum reserve
in order to increase the oil supply and try to stabilize prices. By
Katharine Q. Seelye and David E. Sanger.

<P>
   NY-LAGUARDIA-LIMITS (New York) _ Saying that delays have
increased to an ``unacceptable level'' at La Guardia Airport, the
Port Authority of New York and New Jersey has told airlines that
they cannot add more flights during the airport's busiest flying
times, in the morning and evening. Airline executives immediately
questioned whether the Port Authority, which operates the New York
area's three main airports, has the power to place such
restrictions on adding flights, a move that the agency has never
taken so aggressively before. By Randy Kennedy.

</P>
<P>
   TODDLER-ADVERTISING (Undated) _ This fall, parents and teachers
can choose from a growing stack of children's books starring
brand-name candies and snacks like Fruit Loops Play Book, which
invites toddlers to insert the sugary cereal in cut-out holes in
its cardboard pages. In the last two years, Simon &AMP; Schuster,
HarperCollins, and Scholastic Books have all jumped into the field.
Random House had planned its first entry this year _ a book to
teach toddlers counting using Taco Bell's fast food and Chihauhau
mascot _ until the company killed its Chihuahua advertising
campaign. Food companies see making the snacks heros in children's
books as a rare opportunity to market to toddlers. But not everyone
is pleased. By David D. Kirkpatrick.

<P>

</P>
<P>
   IRAN-WOMEN (Tehran) _ The law in Iran requires women to cover
their hair and to conceal the shape of their bodies in loose
clothing. So one of the coolest things to do in Tehran these days
is to get a nose job. It is so cool that unlike women in many
places, who hide the chiseling and sawing and stretching that has
been done to their faces, Iranian women wear their post-surgical
bandages like badges of honor, or at least indicators of a certain
degree of wealth. By Elaine Sciolino.

</P>
<P>
   NY-SENATE-SOFTMONEY (Undated) _ While Hillary Rodham Clinton
proclaims that she would be willing to forgo soft money for her
Senate candidacy, it would not be easy for her. She has become
increasingly dependent on these donations because her campaign
committee has been dispensing funds at a marked rate, and its
fund-raising has faltered. Her Democratic allies have stepped in to
help her, using soft money, which is raised in unregulated amounts,
to buy commercials promoting her and attacking her opponent, Rep.
Rick A. Lazio. By Clifford J. Levy.

</P>
<P>
   DEATH-PENALTY-STATES (Undated) _ The dozen states that have
chosen not to enact the death penalty since the Supreme Court ruled
in 1976 that it was constitutionally permissible have not had
higher homicide rates than states with the death penalty,
government statistics and a new survey by The New York Times show.
Indeed, 10 of the 12 states without capital punishment have
homicide rates below the national average, FBI data shows. The
Times study found that homicide rates have risen and fallen along
roughly symmetrical paths in the states with and without the death
penalty, suggesting to many experts that the threat of the death
penalty rarely deters criminals from committing crimes. By Raymond
Bonner and Ford Fessenden.

<P>
   WASH-SENATE (Seattle) _ With the success Tuesday of Democrat
Maria Cantwell in the Washignton state Senate primary, the November
election is shaping up a battle of software giants. Slade Gorton,
self-proclaimed ``senator from Microsoft,'' is facing an
unexpectedly strong Democratic challenger in Cantwell, a
41-year-old high-tech executive and former congresswoman. That
Cantwell made her millions at Real Networks, one of Microsoft's
archcompetitors, has only added more intrigue to Gorton's
re-election fight, expected to be the most expensive Senate contest
in Washington state's history. By Sam Howe Verhovek.

`LEFT LUGGAGE': FACING FUTURE, BUT FACING THE PAST 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: Production notes are at end of review.) 
 By STEPHEN HOLDEN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Jeroen Krabbe's earnestly schmaltzy film ``Left
Luggage'' is so intent on pushing its virtuous agenda that its
characters often sound like mouthpieces parroting predigested
attitudes in a debate whose uplifting outcome is a foregone
conclusion. But like parrots, these mostly sympathetic people have
an unfortunate way of repeating themselves. Things that only need
to be said once are frequently restated two or three times, and
after a while you want to shout: ``We get it! We get it!''
</P>
<P>
   That agenda has to do with Jewish identity and self-acceptance
and facing one's memories of Nazi camps rather than burying them
under a facade of homey sweetness and light. Although the movie has
some genuinely touching moments and several strong performances,
its screenplay by Edwin de Vries veers unsteadily between
ham-fisted exposition and cloying sentimentality.
</P>
<P>
   The movie shamelessly dotes on a little boy who is so terrified
of his strict and forbidding Orthodox father that he wets his pants
at the dinner table and is unable to speak. Some tender love and
care and regular visits to a duck pond with his spunky new nanny
are all it takes to unlock his imprisoned voice, and the first word
out of his mouth is a sweetly adorable ``quack.'' But in a movie
that doesn't know when to stop being cute, the quacking quickly
turns into shtick.
</P>
<P>
   The story, set in Antwerp in 1972, follows the spiritual
awakening of Chaja Silberschmidt (Laura Fraser), the nonreligious
20-year-old daughter of Holocaust survivors. A hedonistic college
student, Chaja lives with Gentile roommates, dates a student
revolutionary and blithely proclaims that she hates Jews. She
rarely visits her parents (Marianne Sagebrecht and Maximilian
Schell), who are dealing with the psychic scars of their experience
in opposite ways.
</P>
<P>
   Chaja's mother spends her days baking cakes, weaving blankets
and denying the past, while her father is obsessed with retrieving
some suitcases containing family memorabilia that he buried in the
ground when he fled the Nazis three decades earlier. Because
Antwerp has been so physically transformed since the war, few of
the old landmarks exist. Yet he doggedly traipses about the city
armed with a map and shovel.
</P>
<P>
   Chaja's awakening begins when she takes a job as nanny for the
Kalmans, a Hasidic family that strictly follows Jewish law.
Initially the free-spirited Chaja and the thunderously solemn
paterfamilias (Krabbe) clash. But as she develops a friendship with
Kalman (Isabella Rossellini) and coaxes the couple's mute
4-year-old son, Simcha (Adam Monty), into speaking, she also learns
to respect their way of life. Eventually these ties are deepened by
a tragic accident that tests their friendship and mutual respect.
</P>
<P>
   Rossellini, all pleading eyes and trembling lips, gives one of
her most sensitive performances as the harried, fearful Kalman, and
Fraser is almost as fine as the free-spirited Chaja, who sheds
several layers of arrogance before the story is over.
</P>
<P>
   But the film's secondary roles are stick figures. Sagebrecht's
and Schell's roles are so wooden and one-dimensional that you
almost expect them to burst into an argumentative show tunes when
they disagree. And the movie's designated baddie, a scowling,
anti-Semitic concierge (David Bradley) who terrorizes Chaja and the
Kalmans by barricading the exits to the ground floor of their
apartment, is a ludicrous caricature. These stock characters lend
the film the cartoonish quality that suggests that under its weepy,
soul-searching exterior is a musical comedy struggling to get out.

   GORTON-DAMS (Washington) _ Sen. Slade Gorton offers ``absolute
and unequivocal'' proof that Al Gore favors dismantling Snake River
dams to save salmon. But what Gorton bills at a news conference as
a piece of red meat in one of the Pacific Northwest's most fiercely
debated questions quickly turns into a red herring. The words
Gorton attribute to Gore actually are those of an environmental
group that openly supports removing the dams. Gorton has better
luck on the legislative front, attaching language to a spending
bill that prohibits the government from spending any money this
year on dam removal or studies relating to breaching them, touching
off a howls from the administration, environmental groups and other
lawmakers.

`GROSSE POINTE': THE MELROSE PLACE OF THE MIDWEST

  (Eds.: Broadcast notes appear at end of review. Time and channel

 By CARYN JAMES   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   The three young women carrying their books to class don't look
as if they belong in any high school on earth, which is good. They
fit perfectly in the fun house world of a soap opera, which is
exactly what we are watching them film. As the camera rolls on the
fictional soap ``Grosse Pointe'' _ the show-within-a-show on the
amusing WB network comedy also called ``Grosse Pointe'' _ the
actresses walk side by side down a corridor.
</P>
<P>
   On the right is the star, Hunter, in overdone makeup and
enormous designer earrings, looking like a refugee from a Vogue
fashion layout. In the center is Courtney, her trashy cousin from
West Virginia, whose long blond hair and tiny cut-off jeans seem
inspired by Elly May on ``The Beverly Hillbillies.'' Next to
Courtney is Marcy, a pathetic, trembling creature who has eating
disorder written all over her emaciated body and who mysteriously
finds herself scrunched against the lockers as she walks. As soon
as the camera stops, Marcy blames Courtney for pushing her, but we
know that the back-stabbing Hunter can elbow the competition off
screen even from a distance.
</P>
<P>
   A wicked and clever satire of show business, ``Grosse Pointe''
spends most if its time peering behind the scenes of the soap to
reveal which young heartthrob wears a wig to conceal his seriously
receding hairline. In this universe, the hair and makeup people are
all-knowing and all-powerful.
</P>
<P>
   Soap operas are easy targets, of course, already halfway to
satire. This spoof works because of its viciously sharp insider's
eye. The show was created by Darren Star, who also created ``Sex
and the City'' and ``Melrose Place.'' Most meaningfully here, he
was an executive producer of ``Beverly Hills 90210,'' the teen soap
that ``Grosse Pointe'' so mercilessly sends up.
</P>
<P>
   Though the satire could be directed at any puffed-up celebrity,
it helps to have the key to the ``90210'' references. The endlessly
difficult and egotistical Hunter (Irene Molloy), who plays Becky on
the soap, makes fun of the off-camera reputation of Shannen
Doherty, who was Brenda on ``90210.'' Johnny (Al Santos) is the
good-looking, dim-witted actor who plays Becky's brother, Brad; on
``90210,'' the brother's name was Brandon, played by Jason
Priestly. Quentin (Kohl Sudduth) plays Becky's current boyfriend,
Stone (the Luke Perry role).
</P>
<P>
   The show begins with a scene from the soap, in which Becky and
Stone are in a car crash. In the hospital, Becky's mother learns
her daughter was pregnant but has lost the baby. ``I'm so sorry,
Mom,'' Hunter-as-Becky says in tearful melodrama mode. ``I lose
everything.''
</P>
<P>
   Marcy (Lindsay Sloane) was even more conspicuously Tori Spelling
in the original version of the ``Grosse Pointe'' pilot, in which
she was the niece of the show's producer. But after Aaron Spelling,
who produced ``90210,'' reportedly complained about the blunt
reference to his daughter, the relationship was deleted. Marcy
still has no right being in show business. An Entertainment Weekly
poll has placed her popularity below that of a minor character on
MTV's cartoon ``Daria.'' She handles this by driving to work
repeating ``I love myself, I only eat healthy food,'' then stuffing
a chocolate cupcake in her mouth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Grosse Pointe'' has a terrible time period, sandwiched between
``Sabrina'' and ``Popular,'' two shows aimed at pre-teen-age girls,
probably not the largest audience for show-biz satire. But it's
nice of Star to acknowledge the vacuousness of what he has done
before. He can afford to, now that he is becoming a brand-name
producer, like David E. Kelley or Steven Bochco. His ``Sex and the
City'' goes beyond soap to analyze social manners; his promising
and even newer show, ``The Street'' (on Fox beginning Nov. 1), is
pure melodrama, set on Wall Street. ``Grosse Pointe'' is simply
fun, taking shrewd advantage of the hunger for behind-the-scenes
exposes. There's a lot to be said for a series goofy enough to call
a character Dave the Stand-In.

   (UNDATED) Influenza kills 20,000 Americans each year and experts
are predicting a typically severe season this winter _ one that
could be complicated by possible shortages of flu vaccine.
</P>
<P>
   One major supplier of the vaccine, Wyeth-Ayerst Laboratories in
Philadelphia, will not even begin shipping doses until mid-October
and won't complete shipments until December or January. The company
normally ships vaccine from July until September, a spokeswoman
said. The three other companies that produce the vaccine also are
experiencing delays.
</P>
<P>
   Aventis Pasteur of Swiftwater, Pa., began shipping earlier this
month, four weeks behind schedule. The company, which makes about
half the nation's supply of flu vaccine, will continue shipping
until the end of November.
</P>
<P>
   Experts cite several reasons for the delays. One of the viral
sub-strains grown in eggs _ the A Panama strain _ has not grown as
quickly as expected, delaying the manufacturing process. Meanwhile,
two of the four companies _ Wyeth-Ayerst and Parkedale
Phamaceuticals Inc., of Rochester, Mich. _ are working with the
Food and Drug Administration to correct quality control issues at
their manufacturing plants. The other manufacturer is Medeva Pharma
Ltd. of the United Kingdom.
</P>
<P>
   Each year drug makers deliver about 85 million doses of flu
vaccine to health providers in the United States. The vaccine is
changed slightly each year to provide immunity against whatever flu
viruses are expected to be circulating the globe. CDC officials
said they could not yet determine if manufacturers will meet that
goal this year, or whether shortages will exist. Wyeth-Ayerst
should meet its goal of producing 27 million doses, said company
spokeswoman Audrey Ashby.
</P>
<P>
   The CDC has recommended that employers and health organizations
postpone mass vaccination programs until mid-November. The agency
is also recommending that health providers first give the vaccine
to high-risk people, such as those over the age of 65 or those with
asthma, heart disease or other chronic illness. Vaccines should
also be given first to people who work in hospitals and nursing
homes.
</P>
<P>
   Health experts do not know whether the delays will cause more
people to become ill, or to die, from influenza, a virus that
causes respiratory distress, headache and severe fatigue.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't know the impact of the delay because we don't know if
the flu season will be early or late, severe or mild,'' said
Barbara Reynolds, a CDC spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, health experts from throughout the United States
gathered in Atlanta to develop plans in the event of a severe
influenza pandemic. (A pandemic strikes worldwide.)
</P>
<P>
   ``The rule of thumb is not if, but when, we have a pandemic,''
said Eddy A. Bresnitz, state epidemiologist for New Jersey. ``If a
pandemic were to occur, it would put tremendous stress on our
health care system. I think in the past few years there's been a
realization that something like this can happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Bresnitz said routine immunizations year after year can provide
some immunity even if a new type emerges. This year, Bresnitz said,
he believes the delayed vaccines will probably not cause
significant problems. Most vaccines become effective after two to
four weeks. The peak of the flu season generally hits in late
December and January, so anyone who gets vaccinated in November
will most likely still be well protected from influenza, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Virologists say they cannot predict what kind of flu season
awaits the world this winter, but they note the epidemic almost
always contributes to the deaths of about 20,000 Americans and
sends more than 100,000 to the hospital.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every influenza epidemic is severe,'' said Wendy Keitel, a
virologist at the Influenza Research Center at the Baylor College
of Medicine in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   No evidence suggesting an especially virulent strain has
appeared yet this year, however.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks normal so far,'' said Daniel Lavanchy, coordinator of
epidemic disease control for the World Health Organization. ``But
flu season is unpredictable. If you try to predict, you will get it
wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Flu watchers worldwide are forever on the lookout for
substantial shifts in influenza strains, which could devastate
populations with no immunity to a new strain. A virulent strain of
flu hit in 1957-1958, when the Asian flu killed 70,000 Americans.
And in 1968-1969 the Hong Kong flu killed 34,000 Americans. No
discernible pattern appears.
</P>
<P>
   Each year the strain of influenza changes slightly. New
sub-strains of the major strains _ A and B _ emerge. However, when
a substantially altered strain emerges the population is
defenseless, since people have had no time to build up immunity.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can see how capricious it is. We really can't predict,''
said Keitel. ``All we can say is that it can happen at any time.''

&HT;     GORE URGES RELEASE OF WARTIME OIL STOCKPILE TO CUT PRICES 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)   
 &HT;     By STEWART M. POWELL   
 &HT;     c.2000 Hearst Newspapers   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore urged President Clinton on Thursday to
release part of the nation's wartime petroleum stockpile to drive
down the price of oil, a proposal that Texas Gov. George W. Bush
ridiculed as an election-year stunt.
</P>
<P>
   Energy Secretary Bill Richardson and White House spokesman Jake
Siewert said a decision by the president was imminent. ``He may
decide not to tap it,'' Richardson said, referring to Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Gore insisted that consumers need ``aggressive action right
now'' to cut the price of oil from its current level of almost $38
a barrel, the highest since the Persian Gulf war.
</P>
<P>
   Soaring oil prices are becoming a hot political issue across the
Northeast and Upper Midwest where home furnaces rely upon heating
oil rather than natural gas or electricity to heat homes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not satisfied when the oil to heat your home becomes more
a luxury and not a simple, affordable necessity,'' the vice
president told supporters gathered in front of four large heating
oil storage tanks at Burch Oil Co., in rural Hollywood, Md. ``I'm
not satisfied when filling up your gas tank feels like a major
purchase.''
</P>
<P>
   The price of home heating oil has already increased by one-third
over a year ago. The price is expected to go even higher due to
stockpiles that are 24 percent below last year.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, who casts himself as a populist battling special
interests, said that ``one of the central choices that we face in
this election, just 47 days from now, is whether we will have a
president who is willing to stand up to the big oil interests and
fight for our families.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush, the second-term governor of Texas and a former oil company
executive, said the White House had no business tapping into the
571-million barrel underground petroleum reserve that was created
after the 1973 Arab oil embargo. The original purpose of the
reserve was to protect the import-dependent United States from
supply disruptions. President George Bush tapped the stockpile for
17.3 million barrels of oil during the Persian Gulf war but it has
never been tapped for emergency use in peacetime.
</P>
<P>
   The stockpile, located in underground salt caverns along the
Gulf of Mexico, has enough oil to satisfy the U.S. demand for
imported oil for about 60 days.
</P>
<P>
   The emergency supply should not be used for ``short-term
political gain at the cost of long-term national security'' in an
``attempt to drive down oil prices right before an election,'' Bush
said in Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, a one-time Midland, Texas, oil man, cited a private memo
from Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers to Clinton urging the
White House to reject appeals to release 60 million barrels of oil
from the stockpile because it would be a ``major and substantial
policy mistake'' that could dampen the nation's economic growth.
</P>
<P>
   Summers said late Thursday that Gore's proposal could be a
``prudent use'' of the stockpile ``in current circumstances.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush said any oil price reductions achieved by a temporary White
House-ordered increase in U.S. oil supplies could be quickly
``wiped out'' by production cutbacks by the foreign oil-producing
cartel known as OPEC.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said the oil price increases afflicting the nation
underscored the failure of the Clinton-Gore administration to
encourage greater U.S. oil drilling, production and refining to
``reduce our reliance on foreign oil''
</P>
<P>
   Bush campaign spokesman Dan Bartlett said U.S. crude oil
production had dropped to the lowest level since 1954 over the last
seven years and reliance on foreign oil imports had increased 34
percent.
</P>
<P>
   The American Petroleum Institute echoed Bush's position, saying
the oil stockpile ``should never be used to manipulate prices.''
The association added in a statement: The existing crisis ``has
been a long time coming and it cannot be remedied overnight. In the
long run our country is best served by a comprehensive energy
policy _ something which has been absent for a number of years.''
</P>
<P>
   Nationwide polls continued to show Gore and Bush locked in the
tightest presidential race since 1980. Three polls have Gore
leading Bush by margins of 3 percentage points to 6 percentage
points. One survey had Bush leading Gore by 3 percentage points;
and another survey had the race tied.
</P>
<P>
   Gore went after the oil industry and high oil prices even though
the latest public opinion surveys show him leading in 11 of the 14
states most deeply affected by the rising costs of home heating
oil. The states located in a swath stretching from New England
south to New Jersey and Pennsylvania and across the Great Lakes
states to Wisconsin control 190 of the 270 electoral votes needed
to win the presidency. Polls show Gore leading in every one of the
states except New Hampshire, Ohio and Indiana.
</P>
<P>
   Nationwide, state-by-state polls showed Gore leading Bush in 26
states with 311 electoral votes and Bush leading Gore in 23 states
with 111 electoral votes.
</P>
<P>
   GOP chairman Jim Nicholson derided Gore's proposal. ``There he
`Gores' again _ blaming others for his own failures,'' Nicholson
jibed.
</P>
<P>
   Bush vowed to ``aggressively explore'' oil and natural gas
reserves in North America, saying that he believed oil exploration
and development could take place in the environmentally sensitive
Alaska wildlife refuge that harbors an estimated 10 billion barrels
of oil.
</P>
<P>
   Gore outlined a series of steps to combat soaring energy costs:
</P>
<P>
   _ Clinton should order a series of 5-million barrel
distributions of oil from the petroleum reserves ``in an effort to
stabilize the price of oil at lower levels to help consumers.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Congress should immediately add $400 million to a federal
program to help low-income families pay for home energy costs and
create a temporary $600-million tax credit to encourage home
heating oil suppliers to boost their stockpiles.
</P>
<P>
   _ Congress should make permanent the temporary 2-million barrel
home heating oil reserve created last summer in New England to ease
shortages in the Northeast.
</P>
<P>
   Gore also demanded that OPEC countries make good on their Sept.
10 promise to boost daily crude oil production by 800,000 barrels
or 3 percent, to try to ease the supply shortages that are driving
up the price of finished petroleum products such as home heating
fuel and gasoline.
</P>
<P>
   The United States imports about 55 percent of its daily oil
requirement of 19.5 million barrels.
</P>
<P>
   Gore didn't pass up a chance to add ``big oil,'' a sprawling
U.S. industry that employs 1.5 million people, to a ``special
interests'' hit list that just this week has featured health
insurers, health maintenance organizations and pharmaceutical
companies. Gore said that with oil industry profits ``gushing
through the roof, big oil needs to stop the profiteering.'' Gore
said he eagerly awaits the results of the federal investigation he
urged in May into the ``concentration, noncompetitiveness, and
pricing practices in the oil industry.''
</P>
<P>
   ``OPEC nations have an obligation to live up to those
promises,'' Gore said. ``Big oil needs to stop the profiteering. We
know what is going on here, and we have to end it.''
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Energy Information Administration says the nation's 14
largest oil companies reported earning $15.5 billion in the first
eight months of this year _ nearly three times the profits reported
for the same period in 1999 when crude oil prices were less than
half the $37.80 per barrel cost that they were on Wednesday. That
was the highest level reached since the $41.15 per barrel price
reached during the supply uncertainties caused by the 43-day
Persian Gulf War in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   At the White House, Gene Sperling, director of the National
Economic Council, said Clinton has ``all options on the table,''
adding that the proposals that Gore made ``are very much among
those options that President Clinton does feel are on the table and
is considering.''

HOME VIDEO NOTES AND NEWS 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   RARITIES, NO HOLLYWOOD
</P>
<P>
   There may well be no other project quite like it, not only in
the history of home video but also in the annals of the motion
picture. One eases into such a claim with a deep breath and fingers
crossed, but judge by the facts.
</P>
<P>
   On Oct. 3, Image Entertainment will release a boxed set of four
DVDs with 50 films (45 of them never before available on video)
culled from 18 film archives around the country and put together by
the National Film Preservation Foundation. Based in San Francisco,
the foundation was created by Congress in 1996 to preserve
America's film heritage. ``Everything but Hollywood,'' said Scott
Simmon, a professor at the University of California at Davis who
served as curator of the collection and wrote the informative and
entertaining notes that appear in a 140-page book that comes with
the set and is on the discs as an extra feature.
</P>
<P>
   The series combs the archives for 11 hours of shorts,
documentaries and features made from the 1900s on and then salted
away, so to speak, by an array of organizations, among them the
Alaska Film Archives, the George Eastman House, the
Japanese-American National Museum, the National Archives and
Records Administration, Northeast Historic Film and the Smithsonian
Institution.
</P>
<P>
   Judging by the result, there is a huge body of film on every
conceivable subject, much of it innovative and intriguing, shot
mostly by people far removed from the filmmaking establishment,
many of them amateurs. ``The idea was to show off the strength of
the different archives, balanced with different kinds of films,''
Simmon said.
</P>
<P>
   There are little movies lasting only minutes. ``Demolishing and
Building Up the Star Theater,'' produced in 1901 by the American
Mutoscope and Biograph Co., lasts 80 seconds. But the no-Hollywood
stipulation doesn't disqualify the Western. In ``Hell's Hinges,''
released in 1916 by the New York Motion Picture Co., William S.
Hart stars as a ``reformable man,'' Simmon writes, ``who first
reads the Bible entranced, cigarette and liquor at hand.'' It is
the rare Western that ends, in the words of the film's intertitle,
``while evil and madness join hands in the triumph of victory.''
</P>
<P>
   The newest film in the collection is ``Battery Film,'' a
haunting nine-minute study shot in 1984 of Battery Park City in
winter, preserved by the New York Public Library.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're proudest of putting out some of the earliest avant-garde
films,'' Simmon said. These include James Sibley Watson Jr.'s
free-form and quite strange ``Fall of the House of Usher,'' made in
1928. Joseph Cornell's ``Rose Hobart,'' made in 1936, so infuriated
Salvador Dali that he kicked the projector over.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, still in the avant-garde category, there is J. Stuart
Blackton's ``Princess Nicotine; or, the Smoke Fairy,'' made in 1909
with special effects that puzzled even Scientific American. ``The
little fairy moves so realistically that she cannot be explained
away by assuming she is a doll,'' an article says, ``and yet it is
impossible to understand how she can be a living being.''

   NEW RELEASES
</P>
<P>
   BLACK AND WHITE
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to be black, get into the hip-hop thing,'' Charlie
(Bijou Phillips) tells a documentary maker, Brooke Shields, in
James Toback's film about well-off white teen-agers longing to
crack the black world in New York City. Their eagerness perplexes
Rich Bower (Power of the Wu-Tang Clan), a man of the streets and an
aspiring record producer who attracts white youth as moths to the
flame. The movies haven't treated explicit worship of black culture
in some time. ``Mr. Toback hits it with a chain saw, and the chunks
go flying,'' Elvis Mitchell wrote in The New York Times.

   WHERE THE HEART IS
</P>
<P>
   Abandoned in an Oklahoma Wal-Mart parking lot by her boyfriend,
the destitute unwed mother-to-be Novalee Nation (Natalie Portman)
starts living in the store, borrowing whatever consumer items she
needs. Luckily, an earth mother named Sister Husband (Stockard
Channing) lends her a hand, a young librarian (James Frain) helps
with the birth and Wal-Mart contributes some money and a job as a
photographer. Then there is Novalee's friend Lexie Coop (Ashley
Judd), steadfast mother of five by various liaisons, to help stir
fast-erupting crises into an ``astonishingly shameless melodrama''
(Mitchell).

</P>
<P>
   WAKING THE DEAD
</P>
<P>
   Keith Gordon's painfully earnest screen adaptation of Scott
Spencer's novel grasps at a fusion of historicism and heartbreak we
normally expect to find in Hollywood epics. In the 1970s, Fielding
Pierce (Billy Crudup), a working-class golden boy and congressional
candidate, lost his true love, Sarah (Jennifer Connelly), who was
killed in a car bombing. But well into the next decade Fielding is
still obsessed with her to the point of seeing her apparition on
the street. That could get scary, but the movie loses any chance of
establishing a mood by leaping back and forth between the '70s and
early '80s, ``forever stumbling over itself and breaking its own
spell'' (Stephen Holden).

   THE CUP
</P>
<P>
   World Cup soccer fever sweeps young monks in training at a
Buddhist monastery in India. Problem is, there is no television set
to watch the matches, which prompts the 14-year-old Orgyen (Jamyang
Lodro) to persuade the elders to let him swing a deal to rent a set
for a key game. While the penetration of Western consumer culture
into remote areas is viewed simplistically by most accounts,
Khyentse Norbu's film ``finds ironies and nuances in the encounter
between modernity and tradition that media critics rarely notice''
(A.O. Scott).

   A SUMMER'S TALE. In the third of Eric Rohmer's so-called
four-seasons cycle, a young man travels to the coast of Brittany in

by the Japanese director, author and television personality. In ``A
Scene at the Sea'' (1991, 101 minutes) a deaf garbage collector,
encouraged by his deaf girlfriend, aspires to become a surfboard
champion. The loosely autobiographical ``Kids Return'' (1996, 107
minutes) follows two delinquent teen-agers who cut up at school and
then drop out to take up, respectively, boxing and the gangster

 TEN COOL THINGS ABOUT tHE WOMEN'S MUSEUM 
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 By CATHY FRISINGER and PATRICIA RODRIGUEZ 
 c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Mothers of invention:
</P>
<P>
   A woman invented Liquid Paper. (Bette Nesmith Graham, a Dallas
resident, to be precise.) And a woman invented the square-bottomed
brown paper bag, ubiquitous in grocery stores. (Margaret Knight,
who registered patents for more than 90 inventions prior to her
death in 1914.) Women inventors traditionally haven't gotten the
historical attention awarded their male counterparts; ``Mothers of
Invention and Innovation'' rectifies that, honoring dozens of women
and their inventions. Among them: the self-cleaning house; the
Kevlar bulletproof vest; and the now-obsolete permanent-wave
machine, a torturous-looking device that curled hair by shooting
electricity through it. (Hmm. We thought a man had probably
invented that.)
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   High-tech magic:
</P>
<P>
   This isn't a static, stuffy, stereotypical history museum;
interactive gizmos abound. Like the cellphone guides, a newly
developed network of antennas and cellphones that gives a running
commentary on exhibits. Computers outfitted with touchscreens give
access to music, poetry and commentaries: Touch one screen and hear
snippets of Queen Latifah's music. Touch another and see the words
of Sojourner Truth cascade up an electronic bulletin board. Touch
one more, and pull up facts about one of 140 careers, from
architect to race car driver.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   Foofie's picture:
</P>
<P>
   Foofie Harlan was once a lithesome young pompon girl. As a
senior citizen, Foofie Harlan is still pretty lithesome. Wearing
cheerleader pink and a crown of white hair, the Sun City, Ariz.,
resident is pictured demonstrating her ability to do the splits _
vertically. Posed against a city bus stop sign, Harlan smiles at
the camera with one pink-shod foot planted firmly on the ground,
the other pointing skyward. The picture of Harlan was taken in the
early '90s, but she's still agile. In 1997, Harlan and the Sun City
Poms cartwheeled across the stage of ``Late Night With David
Letterman.'' Harlan, then 82, concluded with a jumping split.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   Reminders of change:
</P>
<P>
   How much have women's daily lives changed in just 100 years? The
small, glass-enclosed time capsule opposite the timeline presents a
snapshot: On the 2000 side, there's a college diploma; on the 1900
side, there's an intricate needlepoint hanging, made by a young
woman as her final project at a ``finishing school,'' and that
era's equivalent of a college degree for young women of a certain
class. There are restrictive, uncomfortable-looking high-buttoned
boots for then; comfy-looking high-tech running shoes for now. But
are all the changes for the better? Take a look at the elaborate
silver salt cellar and pepper shaker from 1900; more trouble to
care for, but how much more gracious a life it implies than today's
plastic, throw-away salt-and-pepper set.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   Showing both sides:
</P>
<P>
   History has its dark side. And, in trying to tell the whole
story, the museum doesn't shy away from less-than-flattering
images. For instance, the timeline showcases a tiny, heavy,
cast-iron flatiron. Called a ``slave iron,'' it was designed with a
small bell in the handle so that the mistress, in another room,
could keep tabs on whether her servant was still working. And a
section on myths displays a Miss America trophy from 1944; you can
see where the owner had taped over the year. Having absorbed the
societal message that beauty was valued but aging women were not,
the winner had happily displayed the trophy in her home, as long as
people couldn't use it to figure out her age.

   Social legacies:
</P>
<P>
   It's just a bike _ its frame twisted and mangled, a wheel
hanging precariously. But this bike was ridden by an 8-year-old boy
named Brian when he was struck and killed by a drunken driver.
Hanging in a display on women's labor and social movements, it
represents Mothers Against Drunk Driving, the group started by
women intent on reducing the number of alcohol-related deaths. Such
women-led groups have helped jumpstart many social movements in the
nation, from abolitionism in the 1800s to temperance and suffragism
in the early 20th century to civil rights in the 1950s and beyond.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Women in art:
</P>
<P>
   In addition to some Georgia O'Keeffe works on hand for the
opening, the museum's first temporary exhibit is about art _ 38
paintings and 12 busts of notable American women, on loan from the
National Portrait Gallery in Washington, D.C. Look for familiar
names (writer Eudora Welty and opera singer Maria Callas), as well
as lesser-knowns like 19th-century artist Sarah Miriam Peale and
psychoanalyst Karen Horney, who challenged Freud's theories about
women. Also on hand: likenesses of Leontyne Price, Ethel Merman,
Marian Anderson, Louisa May Alcott and Ginger Rogers.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Lily Tomlin's Ernestine:
</P>
<P>
   The marquee reads Funny Women, and it's no joke. Inside the
``theater,'' a 13-minute video shows clips from stand-up routines,
sitcoms and big-screen comedies by female comedians, including
Gilda Radner, Tracey Ullman, Lucille Ball, Moms Mabley, Carol
Burnett, Joan Rivers and Paula Poundstone. A standout among the
stand-ups is Lily Tomlin's prune-faced switchboard operator,
Ernestine. Wearing her hair tucked into a bun and her best
pursed-lips expression, Ernestine scolds her unfortunate callers.
``We're the phone company. We don't care. We don't have to.''
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Amazing women, like Temple Grandin:
</P>
<P>
   When Temple Grandin was 3 years old, she still couldn't talk.
But it was worse than that. Doctors diagnosed her condition as
autism, a neurological disorder that impedes the ability to process
emotions and sensory input, and told her parents she must be
institutionalized. Her parents refused.
</P>
<P>
   Grandin had severe difficulties with social skills, but a visit
to a relative's ranch when she was 16 started her down a remarkable
path. Grandin watched one day as cattle were herded through a
chute. When the sides of the chute were contracted, pressing
against the flanks of the cows, the nervous animals were calmed.
She wondered if the confinement of the chute would have the same
effect on the nervousness that she, as an autistic person, felt.
The remarkable answer: It did. (Squeeze machines were later
developed to help people with autism.) It was the start of her
affiliation with animals and a career as a leading designer of
animal-control equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Grandin earned a Ph.D. in animal science from the University of
Illinois and is a professor of animal science at Colorado State
University. She has designed about half of the livestock-handling
systems used to control animals in the United States, and is known
for her special concern that animals be treated humanely.
</P>
<P>
   Visitors to the ``How I Did It'' exhibit at the Women's Museum
can hear her respond to questions such as, ``Are there ways that
being autistic has helped you?'' Yes, Grandin, says. She thinks in
pictures instead of words, so she can test-run equipment in her
head.
</P>
<P>
   A stunning woman, and a stunning exhibit.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   The spirit from on high:
</P>
<P>
   The Women's Museum is a multistory building. What to do with the
stairway space? Why, turn it into an exhibit, of course. Hanging
from the ceiling between floors are images of women who have been
significant leaders in religion, including Mary Baker Eddy, who in
1879 founded the Church of Christ, Scientist (Christian Science);
and Barbara Harris, who became the first female bishop when she was
elected assistant bishop of the Episcopal Diocese of Massachusetts
in 1989. Other stories told: American-Indian medicine woman
shamans, and the life of Antoinette Brown, who completed course
work in theology at Oberlin College in 1850 but was not allowed to
graduate because of her gender, but who nevertheless became the
first ordained minister of a major U.S. denomination.

 &HT;    Romanian sweep doesn't measure up
 &HT;    By Karen Rosen
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY _ Some vaulters landed on their knees. Others were
shocked to find themselves sitting down on the mat.
</P>
<P>
   By the time Olympic officials realized that the vault was set
about two inches too low for Thursday's all-around competition, 18
of the 36 women had competed. Those with low scores, such as Elise
Ray of the U.S. and Svetlana Khorkina of Russia, were demoralized
beyond rescue and one British gymnast was injured.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't believe,'' Ray said, ``a setting at the Olympic Games
can be wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   The blunder, which made the stalled caldron at Opening
Ceremonies look inconsequential, affected the outcome of one of the
highest-profile Olympic events. At the end of the four rotations,
five gymnasts accepted the chance for an unprecedented ``do-over.''
Yet none could crack the Romanian sweep of Andreea Raducan, Simona
Amanar and Maria Olaru.
</P>
<P>
   Ray fell on her rear end on both of her initial vaults, with the
second worse than the first. ``I could do the vault in my sleep,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   She eventually went from 35th to 14th after repeating the vaults
at the proper height, improving her score from 8.618 to 9.487. She
was the top American, as Amy Chow placed 15th and Kristen Maloney
20th.
</P>
<P>
   Ray said she missed with her hands on the original vault height,
which was 120 centimeters instead of 125. The horse had been
altered for the men's competition Wednesday, then supposedly
changed back.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really scared me,'' Ray said. ``I thought something was
wrong, but I didn't know what it was. I was so disappointed. It
carried over the next three events.''
</P>
<P>
   Ray also fell off the beam and stepped out of bounds in floor
exercise on a crash-and-crumple night. Maloney was in ninth place
before taking a couple of steps forward on her beam routine and
bumping her head into one of the beam's support bar.
</P>
<P>
   The vault mistake was fixed after an Australian gymnast noticed
that her coach, who was standing in the distance, wasn't lined up
in the usual way.
</P>
<P>
   Slava Corn of the international gymnastics federation said
organizers were very sorry, but ``we're all human, and sometimes
mistakes do tend to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. national team coordinator Bela Karolyi said it was
``unacceptable at the Olympic level to have an apparatus that is
the wrong height.
</P>
<P>
   ``It took away the confidence of our best gymnast, Elise Ray,''
Karolyi said.
</P>
<P>
   The error, however, didn't faze Raducan, who will be 17 next
week. She scored a competition-high 9.706 points in the event.
</P>
<P>
   Raducan became the first Romanian to win the all-around gold
medal since Nadia Comaneci in 1976. Khorkina, the European champion
who had been favored for the gold, was 11th after botching the
short vault and slipping from the uneven parallel bars.
</P>
<P>
   Raducan closed out the night with a ``Riverdance'' floor
exercise routine for 9.825 points, the highest score of the night.
Her coach lifted her onto his shoulders, where she stood and blew
kisses to the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   The result was the best ever for Romania. They also won the team
event. In 1996, Romania's three competitors took the silver and
tied for the bronze after winning the team silver behind the U.S.
</P>
<P>
   Raducan reminds some of Comaneci, who was 14 when she scored the
first perfect 10s in Montreal.
</P>
<P>
   Comaneci and her husband, Bart Conner, were at the Sydney
SuperDome fulfilling sponsorship commitments Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was wild,'' Comaneci said. ``The Romanians were really
consistent in the team competition. And they just stayed tight
while everybody crashed. Psychologically, they just held on under
all the pressure.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've got everything. The team and the 1-2-3, I think they
can go home now.''
</P>
<P>
   Khorkina, the Russian glamour girl and European champion, was
one of the victims of the vault mishap, falling to her knees on her
first dismount. She didn't try again after the competition,
however, because she was too far out at 11th place.
</P>
<P>
   Khorkina, who posed topless for Russian Playboy, also fell off
uneven bars on her signature release move, just as she did in the
team final Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   In the individual apparatus Sunday and Monday, Ray will compete
on beam, Morgan Hamm on floor exercise and Blaine Wilson on vault.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. runs the risk of leaving the Olympics without a medal
for the first time since 1972.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the vault mistake, Corn said the guidelines about
measuring apparatus will be examined.
</P>

   ``You can't explain the damage that has been done,'' Karolyi
said. ``It was a flagrant failure of the Olympic organizers. Never
in the history of the Olympic Games has this happened. We cannot
protest. It's over, but we can just feel sorry for our Elise who
was messed up, big-time.''

&HT;     PLAN TO PUT A MEMORIAL TO REAGAN ON THE NATIONAL MALL IS
TROUBLING

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A move by some Republican lawmakers to build a
memorial to Ronald Reagan on the National Mall is troubling. They
are seeking to subvert congressionally approved procedures
controlling new monuments on that hallowed strip of land.
</P>
<P>
   Opposition to the plan may sound like a trivial matter to
Americans concerned with jobs, income, taxes, and education of
their children. But it is not trivial. And it may appear to be
partisan vindictiveness to individuals who worship the former
president. But it is not.
</P>
<P>
   At its heart, opposition to the proposal, approved by the House
Resources Committee Sept. 13, is a matter of protecting the mall,
which is visited by hundreds of thousands of Americans each year
who wish to experience the grandeur of their national heritage.
</P>
<P>
   Under the Commemorative Works Act of 1986, an individual is not
to be honored with construction of a memorial until he or she has
been dead 25 years.
</P>
<P>
   Reagan, who is 89, remains very much alive although Alzheimer's
disease has robbed him of the ability to understand what is going
on around him. But if he did, he probably would reject the idea of
building a memorial to a president who is still alive or who only
recently died.
</P>
<P>
   When he was in the White House, Reagan was so dedicated to
preserving the prestige of the presidency that he would not appear
in the Oval Office unless he wore a coat and tie.
</P>
<P>
   After the deaths of John F. Kennedy and Martin Luther King, many
communities named schools, public buildings, parks and highways
after them. But that was not the same as honoring them with
memorials commissioned by Congress.
</P>
<P>
   A half century after Franklin D. Roosevelt died, the nation
finally built a memorial to him on land adjacent to the mall
because he is grouped with George Washington, Abraham Lincoln and
Thomas Jefferson as one of the republic's greatest presidents.
</P>
<P>
   King, who was assassinated 32 years ago, will soon be remembered
with a memorial across the Tidal Basin from the one honoring
Jefferson.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the nation's capital has no memorial to Harry Truman,
who made some of history's greatest decisions as president,
although last week the State Department building was named for him.
The area has only a bridge and an island in the Potomac River named
for Theodore Roosevelt and another bridge bearing the name of
Woodrow Wilson.
</P>
<P>
   Reagan's name already graces the city's national airport and a
huge new federal trade center. That would appear to be enough until
future American leaders determine whether he should be honored with
a memorial on or near the mall akin to those commemorating
Washington, Lincoln, Jefferson and Franklin Roosevelt.
</P>
<P>
   The Reagan memorial effort recalls an earlier rush by
Republicans to honor one of their own. When Sen. Robert A. Taft,
known nationally as Mr. Republican, died in 1953, the
GOP-controlled Congress immediately memorialized him with a bell
tower on the grounds of the Capitol. Taft had been the living
symbol of American conservatism.
</P>
<P>
   Three times _ in 1940, 1948 and 1952 _ he had sought to follow
in the footsteps of his father, William Howard Taft, and become
president. Three times, Republicans refused to make him their
presidential nominee.
</P>
<P>
   But the congressional leaders exercised poor judgment in pushing
for the Taft carillon. No other member of Congress, past or
present, has ever been honored with a monument on the Capitol
grounds. Not even such great statesmen as Daniel Webster, Henry
Clay, John C. Calhoun, Robert LaFollette, George Norris, Hubert
Humphrey, Arthur Vandenburg, Paul Douglas or Mike Mansfield.
</P>
<P>
   When, in 1959, the Senate selected five outstanding past members
whose portraits would hang in the Senate's public reception room,
Taft was one of the five, along with Webster, Clay, Calhoun and
LaFollete. That was a well-deserved honor for the late Ohio
senator.
</P>
<P>
   Yet few tourists now visiting the carillon know much, if
anything, about Taft. Since the carillon is the only monument to a
member of Congress on the Capitol grounds, however, some visitors
automatically assume that Taft was the greatest Capitol Hill
lawmaker in history. In truth, no single individual is worthy of
that designation.
</P>
<P>
   Reagan was a popular president who has some far-reaching
achievements. He restored prestige to the presidency in the wake of
Watergate, Vietnam and the Iranian hostage crisis, which had
diminished the office in the eyes of many Americans.
</P>
<P>
   His national defense policies and his cordial relationship with
Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev undoubtedly hastened an end to the
Cold War.
</P>
<P>
   But on his watch the national debt quadrupled, and the
Iran-contra controversy raised serious questions about what Reagan
knew about deals in which the U.S. government traded arms to Iran
in return for hostages and secretly transferred profits from the
arms sales to the anti-Communist contra rebels in Nicaragua.
</P>
<P>
   Future generations should determine Reagan's place in history.
Then, and only then, should Congress decide whether he deserves on
monument on the National Mall.

<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia _ Chris Miller, a professional ticket scalper
from Chicago, says he likes to think of himself as an Olympic
entrepreneur.
</P>
<P>
   This is not the first Olympic Games he has worked; He hustled
tickets in Atlanta; Barcelona, Spain; and Nagano, Japan. He flew
here several weeks ago. And like hundreds of other scalpers who
have descended upon Sydney from the United States, Britain and
other countries, he is part of an international nether world that
buys and sells tickets for everyone from desperate fans to large
corporations to national Olympic committees.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a ton of guys out here doing what I do,'' Miller said,
pointing down Olympic Boulevard at dozens of scalpers lining the
road. ``Look, that guy over there normally works Wrigley Field.''
</P>
<P>
   The scalping underworld, and the people and organizations it
does business with, received some unwanted attention Thursday. The
International Olympic Committee said it had started an
investigation into accusations that tickets distributed to national
Olympic committees of various countries, including the United
States, had been illegally sold, en masse, to a network of
professional scalpers.
</P>
<P>
   Francois Carrard, director general of the International Olympic
Committee, said: ``We have to investigate. We have to know the
facts.''
</P>
<P>
   Mike Moran, a spokesman for the U.S. Olympic Committee, said:
``The USOC is not engaged in scalping tickets. If we found out that
some governing bodies were scalping tickets, we would take some
form of action.''
</P>
<P>
   Scalpers equipped with cellular telephones and walkie-talkies
have taken their craft to a new level of sophistication here. They
work in groups of as few as two or three people to as many as two
dozen, buying and selling tickets around Olympic Park as if they
were traders on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange. Some
scalpers, like Brion Hargraves, hand out printed business cards
with local cell phone numbers.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Olympic Games have typically been the most
lucrative event for this rogue community, Sydney is turning out to
be a disappointment. Part of the reason is that many spectators
bought tickets before they arrived.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the legal standing of ticket scalping is confusing
here. Buying scalped tickets is permitted, but selling them is not.
The police are trying to make it hard for scalpers to congregate
near Olympic events. Last week, immigration officials refused entry
into the country of a man arriving on a flight from Los Angeles,
because he was thought to be a scalper.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the worst Olympics ever _ I can't make a buck,''
lamented a scalper who identified himself as Eugene from
Sacramento. ``Atlanta was a gold mine. You should complain to the
Olympic committee. The venues are too far apart and the locals are
not buyers or sellers.''
</P>
<P>
   The scalping world depends, of course, on imbalances between
supply and demand. Scalpers typically sell to overeager fans and
corporations, as well as to Olympic committees that seek
surreptitiously to buy blocks of tickets to sold-out events.
Sometimes, too, Olympic committees that want to sell blocks of
tickets also resort to scalpers to help them.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has been said, but never proven, that scalpers get tickets
from national Olympic committees and official sponsors,'' said
Milton Cockburn, a spokesman for the Sydney organizing committee
for the Olympic Games.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Scalpers were busy last Friday on the evening of the opening
ceremony, which was one of the most sought-after and expensive
tickets at the Games. Just two hours before the ceremony was to
begin, a 25-year-old scalper who identified himself only as Trent,
received a call on his cell phone from an intermediary seeking 20
tickets for a corporate client.
</P>
<P>
   Trent, who said he was from Philadelphia and had put himself
through college by scalping tickets to Super Bowls, immediately
sprang into action. Working the incoming crowds near the the
Olympic Park train station, he and a friend offered in Australian
dollars as much as $489 a ticket. That was below the official face
value of $750. But the scalpers knew there would be sellers,
because many tickets for the opening ceremony had been given out
free to Olympic committees.
</P>
<P>
   About 45 minutes before the opening ceremonies began, Trent hit
the jackpot. A man carrying a manila envelope offered to sell 15
tickets for $325 each.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's with the U.S. team,'' Trent said. ``He doesn't care what
he sells them for. He dumps them on the market and walks away with
a tidy profit.''
</P>
<P>
   Trent was also planning on a quick, lavish profit. He said he
would tell the broker for whom he had bought the tickets that he
had paid $540 for each one, enabling Trent to make $216 a ticket.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week, the Sydney Olympic committee tried to make it
tougher for scalpers, telling scalpers inside the Olympic Park that
they were not welcome. Michael Eyers, the committee's deputy chief
executive, said that scalpers found to be holding Olympic tickets
would have their tickets confiscated and would be removed from the
Olympic Park.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Sydney Olympic committee, 85 percent of the
tickets to the Games' events, or 5.5 million tickets, had been sold
by this week. Less than one million tickets still remain on the
market, making it difficult for scalpers to sell tickets at a
premium.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no middle,'' said Jason, a scalper from New York City
who said he spent $5,000 to fly here. Jason said that, because so
many tickets were still available at the box office, he could buy
tickets only for amounts below the face value, and then sell the
tickets at face value.
</P>
<P>
   Tickets range from as much as $750 for the opening and closing
ceremonies to as little as $5.40 for some seats at baseball and
soccer games. The only tickets that scalpers said they had been
able to sell for more than the tickets' face value were for
basketball games involving the American team. Those tickets, which
sold officially for about $25, were scalped for as much as $160.
Tickets for swimming also proved popular, although scalpers had a
hard time fetching a premium for those seats, because of their
already high face value of as much as $250.
</P>
<P>
   ``I made 20 grand in Atlanta,'' Jason said. ``I'm already down
20 grand here.'' &QL;

   Cathy Bonner: The Visionary
</P>
<P>
   Three years ago, Cathy Bonner possessed only a dream about
building a renowned women's museum _ a dream, plus a flimsy 3D
model that she carried around in a Tupperware box, trying to
convert others to her cause. That the building is already a reality
is due partly to her own record of accomplishment; she's a
successful businesswoman who's also a former executive director of
the Texas Department of Commerce, and board president of Austin's
Foundation for Women's Resources, a women's leadership and history
agency. And it's partly due to who she knows. ``Everybody thinks
it's a miraculous accomplishment to raise all this money and pull
this off in four years, but the reality is, it's been 25 years in
the making,'' says Bonner, a Dallas native who spent Saturdays in
Fair Park, ice-skating with her Girl Scout troop. ``We could (build
this museum) because of this incredible network that the foundation
has built.''
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   Candace O'Keefe: The Midwife
</P>
<P>
   Candace O'Keefe was the first person to really hear about Cathy
Bonner's dream, over lunch at an Austin bakery in early '96.
O'Keefe already had a demanding job, as director of Austin's
Foundation for Women's Resources. She could have just told Bonner
that since neither had any experience with museums, they should
just forget it. Instead, she jumped aboard immediately, essentially
doing both jobs at once until being named the museum's executive
director this summer. Commuting weekly from Austin, she ran the
project in Dallas day to day: overseeing design and construction,
hiring staff and leading fund-raising. ``I liken Cathy to the
mother and me to the midwife,'' O'Keefe says. ``The vision was
Cathy's, and I've been the rudder, guiding it along its path.''
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   Wendy Evans Joseph: The Architect
</P>
<P>
   Joseph was recruited as the lead designer early, but almost by
chance: Cathy Bonner read a story about the young New York
architect in ``Working Woman'' magazine, and called her up. Joseph,
who had helped design the Holocaust Museum in Washington, D.C.,
signed onto the project at their first breakfast meeting and worked
the first year for free. An art deco enthusiast, she loved the idea
of saving the old Fair Park building, but admits that it made her
job harder; she had to reinforce a structure nearly 100 years old
in spots. Her design combines the original 1910 architecture, art
deco features added in 1936, and a clean modern design. ``As an
architect, I'm interested in the ability of architecture to tell a
story,'' Joseph says. ``What I really like about (the museum) is
that it combines both an awe-inspiring dynamic of walking into an
important place with kind of a modesty.'' Fitting, she says, for a
museum that celebrates women.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   Ed Whitacre, SBC Communications: The Dealmaker
</P>
<P>
   Museum backers suspected that they would get support from
Whitacre, CEO of SBC Communications, the parent company of
Southwestern Bell. They just didn't realize how much. At his first
meeting with O'Keefe and Bonner, Whitacre pledged $10 million in
matching funds to the fledgling museum _ the largest single
donation by a corporate foundation to a women's project, making up
a third of the museum's funding in one fell swoop. SBC Senior
Executive Vice President Cassandra Carr, an early museum supporter
who was also at that meeting, recalls that Whitacre immediately saw
the museum's worth. SBC had a history of supporting Foundation for
Women's Resources projects. The company was a natural fit with the
museum's high-tech approach. And, she says, ``Basically, Ed
Whitacre's words were, `More than half our customers are women, and
more than half of our employees are women, and there's nothing like
this anywhere. We need to be a part of this.' ''
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   Terren Baker and David Lackey: The Designers
</P>
<P>
   The job of bringing the stories to three-dimensional life fell
to Terren Baker and David Lackey, a New York-based husband-and-wife
team who head the museum design firm Whirlwind and Co. Baker and
Lackey embraced technology, making use of high-definition TV,
computer touch screens that bring up sound and images, and
specially designed cellphones that serve as museum guides. But they
also used physical artifacts _ movie posters, trophies, household
items, sporting goods, clothing _ to tell stories about women who
are famous (Harriet Tubman, Eleanor Roosevelt) and who are not so
well-known. ``We wanted visitors to go through the museum and see
things about women they already knew about, but also learn about
women they didn't know about,'' Baker says. ``Because there are a
lot of incredible women out there people haven't heard about,
because women's history isn't usually told. This tells those
stories.''

 &HT;    Lives in the shadow of the Olympics
 &HT;    By Tom Archdeacon
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY _ Nightfall had settled on the Olympic city. Sprawling
Victoria Park was dark and, to the uninitiated, a bit foreboding.
Massive banyan trees _ their wooden tentacles groping back to earth
_ rose up in front of you like solemn sentries. Up above, fruit
bats with 2-foot wingspans flapped around noisily in the leaves.
</P>
<P>
   You could no longer see the Olympic cauldron from here and
that's just how the people in the ragtag encampment at the far end
of the park liked it. They've got their own special flame,
flickering nonstop in a small campfire that is flanked by some 40
tents. They call this the Aboriginal Tent Embassy. It was
designated by a red, black and yellow Aborigine flag that hung from
a tree limb and a homemade placard that read: ``Give Australia Back
Its Pride, Stop the Bloody Genocide.''
</P>
<P>
   During the Olympic Games, this park just beyond the central
district of Sydney, has become a gathering spot for Australia's
downtrodden people of color, people who mostly have been left
disenfranchised in a land they've inhabited for over 40,000 years.
</P>
<P>
   Clarrie Isaacs, a 52-year-old Aborigine activist, is living
here: ``The flame in our fire also was carried all across
Australia. It symbolizes the fire within our people, a fire we
cannot let go out. We put (eucalyptus) branches on it in special
ceremonies. The smoke it makes helps cleanse and purify. That is
needed now.''
</P>
<P>
   You ask him about the Olympic flame, especially since it was lit
by Cathy Freeman, the most prominent Aborigine of all. The first
Aboriginal athlete to achieve international success since Evonne
Goolagong won major tennis tournaments in the 1970s, she took a
silver medal in the 400 meters at the 1996 Olympics, has been the
unbeaten world champ the past two years and here in Sydney _ where
she runs her first 400 heat tonight _ is favored to take gold.
</P>
<P>
   Three years ago one Australian newspaper poll voted the
charmingly shy athlete the most admired woman in Australia. That
was before last Friday night when her stature _ in most eyes _ was
taken to new heights. She was the star of an Olympic Games Opening
Ceremonies that included many Aborigine performers and 10 other
Aborigine athletes in the Australian contingent of 627.
</P>
<P>
   Dressed in a white, full-length body suit and carrying the
Olympic torch, Freeman _ who saw the moment as ``historical, a big
boost for all Aboriginals,'' _ literally walked on water as she
ascended waterfall stairs to light the Olympic cauldron as 120,000
fans and fellow athletes stood below her and cheered. The spectacle
won rave reviews across Australia and worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   And yet for all that, no Olympic athlete at these Sydney Games
carries a bigger burden than the 27-year-old Freeman. She is caught
between two worlds _ Australian and Aboriginal _ and the tug of war
is on. To understand, listen to Isaacs:
</P>
<P>
   ``Her lighting the torch _ that was a real sham. A political
stunt to show we have a friendly relationship where there is none.
On the night she stood up there with that flame, thousands of her
people went to bed hungry, thousands were homeless in the streets,
thousands woke up without hope of employment. Her lighting the
torch was irrelevant.''
</P>
<P>
   Australian boxer Anthony Mundione _ also an Aborigine _ said
Freeman lighting the torch was a token gesture. He told Sydney
reporters it was ``sickening'' to see Prime Minister John Howard
applauding and caring as if everything is fine with the Aborigines,
when really ``he doesn't know anything about their history or
plight.''
</P>
<P>
   Aborigines were nomadic hunters still using stone tools when
European settlers first arrived here late in the 18th century. From
the start, the colonialists treated the Aborigines like dirt.
</P>
<P>
   People were chased from their land. Many were killed, Many more
died from diseases, depression and mistreatment. Today, Aborigines'
life expectancy rate is an average 18 years shorter than other
Australians. The infant mortality rate is three times higher.
Aboriginal young people account for half those incarcerated and
unemployment is five times higher than in the rest of the nation.
There are problems with drugs, alcohol, high birth rates, domestic
violence and suicide.
</P>
<P>
   While most aborigines live in remote settlements, the Sydney
neighborhood of Redfern includes a slum of hundreds of Aborigines
families. The neighborhood is covered with angry graffiti, the
rusting hulls of burned out cars and despair. Abandon houses either
are boarded up or become open air drug marts with people brazenly
shooting heroin right out front.
</P>
<P>
   Until 1962, Aborigines weren't allowed to vote. They weren't
counted in the census until 1967. ``Until then I was considered
nothing but flora and fauna,'' said Isaacs, one of the estimated
390,000 Aborigines _ 2 percent of the population _ who live in
Australia.
</P>
<P>
   That lack of regard for Aborigines was never more evident than
when the Australian government sponsored a children stealing
program from 1910 to about 1970. White authorities took
mostly-light skinned Aborigine children from their mothers and
placed them in training homes or straight into foster families in a
chillingly unconscionable attempt to assimilate them into white
society.
</P>
<P>
   Over 100,000 children may have been involved. The practice was
not made public until Sir Ronald Wilson published a bombshell 1997
report called ``Bringing Them Home. `` Today those abducted
children are known as the Stolen Generation.
</P>
<P>
   As Aborigines have sought acknowledgement, reparation and
especially an apology, they have been especially rebuffed by the
prime minister, who said he has regrets for previous government
mistakes, but won't offer apologies.
</P>
<P>
   It was that attitude that finally forced Freeman to speak out
this July. In the past she had celebrated victories _ at the
Commonwealth Games in 1994 and the World Track and Field
Championships in 1997 _ by taking a victory lap around the track
carrying the Aboriginal flag.
</P>
<P>
   Two months ago, she took aim at Howard's arrogant denials. She
accused Australian government leaders of insensitivity for refusing
to apologize to The Stolen Generation. It was then she let it be
known that her maternal grandmother had been taken from her family
and never reunited. ``Parts of peoples lives were stolen,'' Freeman
said. ``My grandmother never found her mother again, never found
her family. She didn't even know how old she was because there were
no records.''
</P>
<P>
   To get her point across, Freeman offered an example: ``If
Americans are looking for a parallel, I guess our situation is
similar to the Indians in the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   The more you listen to her, the more you realize she deserves
more credit than she gets. Granted she has separated herself from
much of the Aborigine experience these days _ she was long involved
with a local sports writer who was also her manager and now she's
married to an American NIKE executive _ she has been a positive
messenger for Aboriginal people.
</P>
<P>
   For white Australia, her popularity has forced a rethinking of
attitudes toward a people too often stereotyped as boozing loafers
or sad primitives. Showing an excellence in the sporting arena and
warmth away from it, she is easy to embrace. Some see her as a
modern day Jesse Owens or Jackie Robinson, breaking barriers and
bigots with every stride.
</P>
<P>
   It is for that reason some Aborigine protests planned here did
not materialize. People were torn between the opportunity to state
their case while the world was on Australia's doorstep and the
concern they could ruin what some had dubbed ``Cathy's Games''.
</P>
<P>
   Isaacs would rather she didn't compete, but since she was _ and
he said he wants her to win, though he wouldn't watch _ he wishes
she would run straight from the stadium to his Aboriginal camp
after her race: ``We don't want her here as an athletic star, just
an Aborigine. We know today's tall poppies can just as well be
tomorrow's feather duster.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mostly I'd like to talk to her, tell her what she could do.
I'd like to tell her about Marlon Brando giving his Academy Award
to the Indians or Muhammad Ali throwing his medal into the river.
She's got to make a stand. You can't just get into this half way.''
</P>
<P>
   Freeman agreed. She said she wishes she didn't have to get into
it at all: ``I don't like things to be stressful. I'm such a shy
thing, I don't like to make political statements. I just want to
run. I want to run fast and I want to win. But there's probably
more to it than just that. Out there on the track, that is when I
feel most free.''

<P>
   NEW YORK _ You can almost hear the eyebrows knitting and the
nostrils flaring. The Brooklyn Museum of Art, the object of all
kinds of opportunistic and misguided moralizing during its
``Sensation'' exhibition last year, has now mounted an exhibition
titled ``Hip-Hop Nation: Roots, Rhymes and Rage.'' The show, which
was organized by Kevin Powell, a music critic and historian, for
the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum in Cleveland, has been
tweaked and expanded for Brooklyn with help from Kevin Stayton,
director of the museum's decorative arts department.
</P>
<P>
   Its mission is to survey the innovative and by now worldwide
explosion of culture and commerce that is hip-hop _ a phenomenon
whose chief art forms are music, poetry and dance and one that has
been condemned for lyrics containing harshly realistic depictions
of inner-city life, references to sex and violence or displays of
misogyny, homophobia and anti-Semitism.
</P>
<P>
   But there's no need for worry. Despite its focus on one of the
(sometimes) rougher sides of popular culture, this is a tame,
diluted show. I have never seen a major museum exhibition that
looks so nearly identical to the requisite gift shop at its end.
</P>
<P>
   The show is chock-a-block with posters, album covers, T-shirts,
sneakers, jackets and baseball caps; some of them are the stage
gear of hip-hop stars, others are the products of hip-hop designers
like FUBU (For Us By Us), or of hip-hop-influenced designers like
Tommy Hilfiger. Its memorabilia includes handwritten lyrics,
sunglasses and glitzy gold medallions, as well as the 1990 decision
of a Florida court (later overturned) that some of 2 Live Crew's
lyrics were obscene.
</P>
<P>
   This array of material presents a reasonable, if highly
simplified outline of hip-hop history, from its emergence in the
South Bronx of the 1970s to world domination. There are dozens of
the modest Xeroxed handbills, some of them designed by the graffiti
artist Phase2, that advertised hip-hop events in its underground
years; a zany album cover from Sugar Hill, the small New Jersey
record company that brought out ``Rapper's Delight,'' the first
national hip-hop hit; and scores of glossy magazine covers _ Vibe,
Source, Rolling Stone, Harper's Bazaar _ featuring the faces of
hip-hop stars.
</P>
<P>
   Objects that transcend mere historical interest include two big,
bold black-and-white posters designed for Public Enemy by Eric Haze
of the Beastie Boys, the first white hip-hop group. In the
``Roots'' section, a contemporary copy of one of Cab Calloway's
rakish zoot suits _ this one in bright yellow with matching hat _
demonstrates that hip-hop's penchant for sartorial exaggeration is
a long-standing tradition. Also striking is a long gold cloak, its
shoulders studded with horns of silver glitter, worn by the D.J.
Afrika Bambaataa in performance, and a varsity-type jacket in red,
white and yellow leather belonging to Pepa of the female hip-hop
duo Salt-n-Pepa: It is appliqued with the classical masks of
tragedy and comedy, but their traditional meaning is skewed with
the words ``Laugh Today, Cry Tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   The exhibition's overall effect is heavy with the personalities,
products and relics of hip-hop, yet curiously untouched by its
artistic vigor: The words, sounds and moving bodies that are the
essence of hip-hop are nearly invisible here. Some of its problems
could have been solved by including lots more, rather than just a
few snippets, of the innovative '80s music videos that disseminated
the hip-hop sound and look worldwide. But that might have brought
some of hip-hop's jarring lyrics into the museum.
</P>
<P>
   Hip-hop is so full of raw, unfiltered life _ and is also such a
marketing force _ that some people have trouble seeing it as art.
But art it definitely is, the latest wave of innovative black music
that began with the ragtime of Scott Joplin and the Delta blues of
Robert Johnson. This fabulous, constantly mutating hybrid drew on
rhythm and blues, disco, salsa, reggae and the ancient ritual of
call and response _ all brought together by D.J.'s who made a
genuine, structurally new music by scratching, cutting and sampling
existing records on double turntables.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Performing first in parks and at parties, hip-hop's founding
D.J.'s _ Grandmaster Flash, Bambaataa and Kool D.J. Herc _ combined
the percussive sounds of needle on vinyl (scratching) with
precisely chosen, rapidly repeated breaks from other people's music
(cutting and sampling). Among those who responded first to these
sounds were young dancers, many of them Latin, who developed the
acrobatic intricacies of break-dancing. When the masters of
ceremonies who introduced the DJs (and sometimes the DJs
themselves) started talking in rhyme over the sounds emanating from
the turntables, the insistent spoken word art generally known as
rapping was born (although emceeing is the preferred term among
insiders).
</P>
<P>
   Hip-hop has been called a folk art by some and postmodern by
others. Even though it is not foremost a visual art, its
possibilities as the subject of a show in an art museum (as opposed
to a music or historical museum) are rich.
</P>
<P>
   First of all, it inspired the exuberantly pictorial writing of
graffiti art. The few examples added for the show's Brooklyn
installation only make you wish for more. (They include a relief by
Phase2, paintings by Lady Pink and Toxic, and a painted subway-car
door by Tracy 168 that is currently the subject of a dispute
between the artist, Michael Tracy, and the estate of the art dealer
Sidney Janis, which donated it to the Brooklyn Museum last year.)
Hip-hop had a direct influence on artists like Jean-Michel
Basquiat, who is represented here by a single, pathetic
screenprint. It provided an inspiring cultural backdrop for the
artists who worked in the South Bronx in the 1980s, including John
Ahearn and Tim Rollins and KOS, whose work is absent here.
</P>
<P>
   More generally, to look at hip-hop through the lens of
contemporary art _ or vice versa _ can reveal an exhilarating array
of connections. Hip-hop's emphasis on language, its often harsh
realism and political slant (or, conversely, its blatant political
incorrectness), its dense collaging of (sound) fragments and
borrowed cultural references _ all have correlatives in the work of
visual artists throughout the 1980s and '90s, from Sigmar Polke to
Barbara Kruger to Kara Walker.
</P>
<P>
   Hip-hop's inventive wordplay and often brilliant linguistic
contortions have not only spawned new words, but also triggered a
poetry revival among urban youth that has strong connections to
performance art (as seen in the heavily attended poetry slams at
New York sites like the Nuyorican Cafe, Bar 13 and Urbana). A
broader visual manifestation is hip-hop's profound influence on the
way people dress in general and on fashion in particular, from the
sports arena to the runway.
</P>
<P>
   You come into this show expecting some kind of dazzle and
aggressiveness _ a wall of garments all made in denim or
camouflage, perhaps; examples of haute couture riffs on hip-hop
style; or big blown-up texts that would fling hip hop's
in-your-face lyrics in your face. Keith Haring's graffiti portrait
of Fred Braithwaite _ a graffiti artist himself under the tag Fab
Five Freddie _ is a perfectly nice addition. But some of the music
videos Braithwaite and others directed in the 1980s would not only
have brought hip-hop sounds and moves into the museum, they would
also have merited consideration as video art.
</P>
<P>
   This show feels like a cross between a mall and a mausoleum, and
this seems to be a result of the museum's trying to handle a
controversial art form as uncontroversially as possible. But all
the Brooklyn Museum really needed to do was simply act like what it
is, a serious art museum approaching a multimedia art form. With
all respect to the obvious efforts of Powell and Stayton, this
would have required a much broader array of expertise and
resources, beginning with the involvement of curators of
contemporary art and fashion. Hip-hop is a big subject that
deserves the big treatment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hip-Hop Nation: Roots, Rhymes and Rage'' is at the Brooklyn
Museum of Art through Dec. 31.

WHITEWATER CASUALTIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AS THE FURIOUS torrent that was the Whitewater investigation
recedes, the personal reputations of President and Mrs. Clinton are
like detritus left upon the shore. On Wednesday, independent
prosecutor Robert W. Ray said he could find no evidence that the
Clintons broke any laws in connection with the 1978 Arkansas land
deal and declared the investigation closed. Six years and $52
million later, the most enduring legacy of the Whitewater and
related investigations is President Clinton's seamy affair with
Monica Lewinsky and his inability to tell the truth about it.
</P>
<P>
   As conspiracies go, Whitewater was diverting but hardly the most
insidious. First Filegate, then Travelgate, and now the central
questions _ about whether the Clintons lied about the money
channeled by their business partners to prop up the failing real
estate deal _ all have fallen for lack of supporting evidence.
</P>
<P>
   But just because no laws were broken doesn't mean the Clintons'
reputations are intact. Few would argue that in mounting their
defense, the Clintons didn't stall, obfuscate, and lie. Who can
believe the story of how 116 pages of billing records from Hillary
Clinton's Rose law firm, missing for months, magically appeared on
a White House table? And of course Ray's predecessor, Kenneth
Starr, eventually snared Monica Lewinsky, who provided evidence
countering Clinton's sworn testimony about her, leading to his
impeachment. Ray may yet seek a criminal indictment of Clinton on
charges of perjury after the president leaves office.
</P>
<P>
   Still, nothing that happened in Arkansas affected Clinton's
ability to be president, except that the ever-widening
investigations and their fallout became a maddening distraction.
</P>
<P>
   Another casualty of Whitewater is the Independent Counsel Act
itself, which was allowed to expire when it came up for renewal in
1999. There ought to be some independent mechanism for
investigating official wrongdoing at the highest reaches of
government, but the special prosecutor law gave Ray and his
predecessors powers that were too sweeping, with an unlimited
budget and no time constraints for bringing the investigations to a
conclusion. In the end both parties saw it as a threat.
</P>
<P>
   Even without a special prosecutor, the vilification of public
figures, the politicization of ethics, and the attendant media
frenzies will go on. In the definitive book ``Scandal,'' written in
1991, before the Whitewater story broke, Susan Garment laments ``a
culture of mistrust'' that increases alienation from government,
encourages hypocrisy, and blurs the distinctions between trivial
and arrant corruption. That may be the most lasting, and saddest,
Whitewater legacy of all.

GORE'S OIL MOVE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AL GORE PERFORMED a double service Thursday in advocating use of
the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to stabilize oil prices. Just by
making the suggestion, he may have cooled some price fevers. He has
also made energy, and especially petroleum, an issue in the
presidential campaign _ an area of much room for argument with
George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   The specifics of Gore's proposal are open to challenge. In
suggesting that blocks of 5 million barrels be released from the
570-million-barrel reserve to oil companies _ to be repaid later _
he has telegraphed specific information to producers and holders of
inventories. It would be sounder, tactically, to indicate that the
reserve was available but not predetermine amounts, in order to
keep an element of uncertainty in the minds of producers.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's snap criticism, that producers would cut output to match
the flow from the reserve, is only partly reasonable. Some
producers are turning out oil nearly at capacity already because
they need the revenue. Most _ Great Britain, Norway, Mexico,
Venezuela, Canada, Saudi Arabia, to name the biggest examples _
have no reason to inflict economic harm on their customer countries
since recessions would injure their own long-term interests. Iraq
might play a harmful role, but the Saudis have the capacity to
offset cutbacks there.
</P>
<P>
   Holders of inventory, on the other hand, might try to avoid the
costs associated with storage and financing by relying on the US
reserve and similar reserves in other countries to meet their
peak-demand needs. Being vague about amounts to be released from
the reserve _ as central banks are vague in talking about
intervention in currency markets _ would tend to keep private
inventories at higher levels.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, Gore's suggestion has now established some
uncertainty. It also may encourage other nations to put into play
an additional 500 million barrels of their reserves. Even that
potential would be useful.
</P>
<P>
   The industry and Governor Bush have been critical of using the
reserve to influence prices, arguing that free markets are better
than government intervention. That might be the case if markets
were genuinely free, but they are not. OPEC has been successful for
two years in restraining output in order to increase prices and has
been slow in increasing production to offset price hikes that even
some of its members regard as excessive.
</P>
<P>
   The real problem is less one of production than of inventories,
which look inadequate for the coming winter season. Gore has put
that issue on the table. He and Bush should debate the question so
that voters can understand where each candidate stands and what he
represents.

 &HT;    SOME SUGGEST GORE PETROLEUM PLAN IS MOTIVATED BY POLITICS

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Cradled in four cavernous bowls, carved out of
underground salt domes in south Louisiana and East Texas, lie some
571 million barrels of crude oil, the nation's last line of defense
against a cutoff in petroleum imports.
</P>
<P>
   Like a giant spare tank of gas, the Strategic Petroleum Reserve
(SPR) has stood sentry for decades against the prospect that an oil
embargo, naval blockade or all-out war might somehow threaten the
Achilles' heel of the American economy _ foreign oil that accounts
for nearly six out of every ten gallons of fuel consumed in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, though, politics has crossed swords with energy
security.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore, running hard against Texas Gov. George
W. Bush in this year's presidential campaign, has called on
President Clinton to release some of this country's emergency fuel
to ease the pain of soaring fuel prices for consumers in the
Northeast.
</P>
<P>
   Gore pressed Clinton on Thursday to release some of the reserves
_ in a series of 5-million-barrel batches _ to try to press down
prices topping $37 a barrel, a ten-year high.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is expected to announce a decision as early as Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Specifically, Gore has asked the president to authorize the
releases in the form of swaps. This means oil companies would, in
effect, use the SPR as an oil bank, borrowing crude immediately,
using it to help build up inventories of home heating oil ahead of
the winter demand spike, then pay back the SPR sometime next year.
Companies wanting SPR crude would bid on it, promising to return a
greater volume than they borrowed or to return an equal volume of a
higher quality oil, explained George Beranek, market analyst for
Petroleum Finance Co., an oil industry consulting firm in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of the plan were quick to point out that the SPR was
designed to protect the country from a severe oil shock, not the
pain of election-year fuel price hikes.
</P>
<P>
   They point to the statute Congress enacted when it created the
SPR in 1975, in the wake of an Arab oil embargo that had thrown the
country into a crisis of chronic fuel shortages and left angry
consumers lining up at gasoline stations to fill their tanks.
</P>
<P>
   The law authorizes the president to draw down SPR supplies to
counter a ``severe energy supply interruption,'' that is ``of
significant scope and duration, and of an emergency nature,'' and
that ``may cause major adverse impact on national safety or the
national economy.''
</P>
<P>
   The statute further stipulates that the disruption must have
resulted from ``an interruption in the supply of petroleum
products, an interruption in the supply of domestic petroleum
products, or sabotage or an act of God.''
</P>
<P>
   Those conditions have been met only once, when President George
Bush released 17 million barrels during the Persian Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
   Under a special provision that allows for tests of the SPR's
drawdown and distribution system, however, the president is
authorized to make a limited sale, or swap, of up to 5 million
barrels, as Gore has suggested, without showing any national
security threat.
</P>
<P>
   Just this summer, in fact, there were two releases of 500,000
barrels each, to assist refineries that were experiencing temporary
supply problems after a tanker unloading dock collapsed.
</P>
<P>
   Tina Kreischer, spokeswoman for the Senate Energy and Natural
Resources Committee, said the law makes clear, though, that SPR oil
is not meant to be used as a cushion against price increases.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe that it says that you are to use the SPRO
(Strategic Petroleum Reserve Oil) only in the case of a severe
supply disruption,'' said Kreischer. ``It's not there to manipulate
the market.''
</P>
<P>
   While crude prices have been climbing steadily over the past
year, ``there isn't really a lack of supply at the moment,'' said
Kreischer. In fact, she said, the nation's refineries are running
at above 95 percent of their capacity _ essentially flat out.
</P>
<P>
   Even if additional crude oil is released from the SPR, she said,
it would likely take weeks before it could be processed, and much
would simply sit in the pipelines.
</P>
<P>
   Any impact on prices, moreover, would likely be minimal, as 5
million barrels is roughly enough to supply the country's oil needs
for six hours.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's more of a gesture,'' said Beranek.
</P>
<P>
   The strategic petroleum reservoirs are in four locations: Bayou
Choctaw, near Baton Rouge, La.; West Hackberry, near Lake Charles,
La.; Big Hill, near Beaumont, Texas, and; Byran Mound, near
Freeport, Texas.

<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia _ An inexplicable error made in the
measurement of the vault apparatus during the women's Olympic
all-around final Thursday night cast doubt on the validity of the
outcome and may have cost the former world champion, Svetlana
Khorkina, a chance to win a medal.
</P>
<P>
   As controversy about the error roiled backstage at the Super
Dome, the dominant Romanians were claiming every space on the medal
stand. Unflustered by the situation, Romania became the first
country to have its gymnasts take the gold, silver and bronze
medals since the former Soviet Union swept the event in 1960.
</P>
<P>
   But as a joyful Andreea Raducan was accepting her gold medal
after her spectacular night, as the silver medalist Simona Amanar
waved to the crowd, and while Maria Olaru gripped her bronze medal
tightly, an angry Khorkina told reporters to ``get lost'' and left
the arena.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps more than anyone, the graceful Russian was affected by
the measurement blunder made by the technical personnel from the
Federal Internationale de Gymnastique, the governing body for the
sport.
</P>
<P>
   Through the first two of the four vault rotations _ during which
18 of the 36 gymnasts competed _ the block was 120 centimeters
(just over 47 inches) above the floor instead of the mandatory 125
centimeters (just over 49 inches). The nearly 2-inch difference in
height threw off the timing and technique of several gymnasts.
</P>
<P>
   Just before the third rotation, an Australian gymnast, Allana
Slater, questioned the height of the apparatus. Officials then
readjusted it. Once the competition ended, competitors in the first
two rotations were given a chance to vault again. But the
psychological damage had been done, particularly in Khorkina's
case.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian diva of gymnastics led the competition after her
floor exercise, but crashed badly on her next event, the vault,
landing on her knees and bumping her head into the mat. She scored
a dreadful 9.025. By the end of the rotation, she had plunged into
10th place.
</P>
<P>
   ``She is our No. 1 gymnast,'' said Valery Dianov, a Russian team
official, speaking through an interpreter. ``We expected her to be
an Olympic champion. But that jump, the vault was too low. She was
emotionally depressed.''
</P>
<P>
   Still visibly upset, Khorkina then became unraveled on her
signature event, the uneven bars. Two moves on the apparatus are
named after her, but with her psyche in tatters, she fell on a
daring release move she usually handles easily.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like she said, `Welcome to my nightmare,''' said the
former American gold-medalist Peter Vidmar, an analyst for NBC.
``When she blew the vault, the tears came. She knew it was all
over. When she got on the uneven bars, all the wind was out of her
sails.''
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the night, Khorkina did not choose to vault again.
She was in 11th place, and after her fall on the uneven bars, not
even a perfect score would have put her on the medal stand.
Instead, she sat in a huff, talked on a cell phone, and looked
disgusted by the situation. But Elise Ray, of Columbia, Md.,
decided to re-vault, and stood as proof of just how much about 2
inches can mean.
</P>
<P>
   She had no chance at a medal, but she knew she was better than
the 35th spot she occupied thanks in large part to her 7.618 score
after two horrific landings on the vault. With the vault block at
standard height, her mechanics were uninfluenced. She stuck her
landing and replaced her disastrous score in the first rotation
with a 9.487. With that, Ray rocketed 21 spots through the
standings. Instead of an embarrassingly low finish, the U.S.
national champion ended up in 14th place.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know what was wrong,'' Ray said. ``It looked low to
me, but I thought it was my nerves. Definitely falling on your
first event shoots your confidence way down. That was the toughest
part, just to keep going.''
</P>
<P>
   This was the first time in memory that such an error was made at
the Olympics. Although many gymnasts were upset, Slava Corn, a
gymnastics federation official, said the athletes had no recourse
in this type of situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never seen anything like this,'' U.S. Coach Kelli Hill
said. ``At the Olympics? It's unbelievable.''
</P>
<P>
   There is a system of checks and double-checks for the equipment.
The technical staff makes the measurements, then there are
officials and judges who make visual scans of the apparatus.
Somehow, the vault escaped everyone's attention until Slater did
the math.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know where I stand next to the vault, and I know how high it
is on me,'' Slater said. ``You don't think of something like this
happening at the Olympics. It could have totally changed
everything.''
</P>
<P>
   There is no way of knowing what, if any, change in the outcome
would have occurred. Other gymnasts, like Raducan, were unaffected.
She was also in the marred rotation groups, but effortlessly landed
her vault with a 9.7.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Unlike the willowy Khorkina, Raducan is the template for the
gymnastic pixie. At 4-feet-10-inches tall, holding at 82 pounds,
Raducan is a pillow mint next to Khorkina. With her size, speed and
quickness, she can adjust more easily to a low vault. As Vidmar
said, ``It was like jumping a lunch box,'' for the 5-feet-4{-inch
Khorkina.
</P>
<P>
   Controversy aside, the diminutive Raducan was a strong adversary
for Khorkina. While the 21-year-old Khorkina was the world champion
in 1997 and won the European title earlier this year, the
16-year-old Raducan had risen to the level of the elite.
</P>
<P>
   She unveiled her talent on the floor exercise. Khorkina had the
top score on that event (9.812) Thursday evening until Raducan
finished off her competition with a 9.825. A product of Romania's
factory-like gymnastics system, Raducan was a vision of precision
and consistency. She had only one score below a 9.7, a 9.575 on the
uneven bars.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Raducan, and her two medal-winning teammates, were
examples of the vice grip the Romanians have on gymnastics. Once,
the Russians ruled this way. Now, it is the Romanians. Not only did
they sweep the all-around, they won the gold in the team finals
Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very excited,'' Raducan said through an interpreter. ``I
was very happy that I got the gold in the team, and I expected a
good result tonight. It was important to do my best. I am very
happy that I was able to control my emotions.''
</P>
<P>
   Raducan was unshakable. Nothing rattled her, not her own
minuscule errors, and not the one glaring mistake made by the
technical staff.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a tragedy for all the athletes,'' Vidmar said. ``For
the rest of Khorkina's life _ or for any of the gymnasts _ they'll
say, `What if?' This was something they had no control over. That's
what's sad.''

 &HT;    There's magic in the music
 &HT;    By Dave Larsen
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO _ ``Almost Famous'' is the semi-autobiographical story
of a 15-year-old music fan who lands an assignment from Rolling
Stone magazine to interview an up-and-coming rock band.
</P>
<P>
   Against his mother's protests, the young man joins the band on
tour, where amid the backstage circus he struggles with his
objectivity and falls for a beautiful ``band aid'' who calls
herself Penny Lane.
</P>
<P>
   ``It all happened,'' said writer-director Cameron Crowe at a
media conference at the 25th annual Toronto International Film
Festival, where ``Almost Famous'' premiered.
</P>
<P>
   ``It all happened in slightly different order and sometimes
exactly the way it's portrayed, which probably made it a little
tough on these amazing actors, because they knew they not only had
to please me but please a memory,'' Crowe said.
</P>
<P>
   Crowe, the Academy Award-nominated writer-director of ``Jerry
Maguire,'' began his journalism career at age 15, profiling bands
for such publications as Creem. Like his protagonist, William
Miller, Crowe joined the staff of Rolling Stone at 16.
</P>
<P>
   Set in 1973, his heartfelt cinematic memoir features an
outstanding ensemble cast that includes Oscar winner Frances
McDormand, Billy Crudup, Kate Hudson and Jason Lee. Patrick Fugit
makes his film debut as Miller. Philip Seymour Hoffman plays
Crowe's real-life mentor, legendary rock music critic Lester Bangs
_ who warns Miller not to make friends with the rock stars,
advising him to be ``honest and unmerciful.''
</P>
<P>
   The film, which opens nationwide today, is the year's first sure
Oscar contender.
</P>
<P>
   Crowe, 43, based his screenplay on his youthful experiences
touring with Led Zeppelin, the Eagles, Lynyrd Skynyrd and the
Allman Brothers Band.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Allman Brothers Band was the first band that took me on
the road, and I did not want to go home,'' he said. ``My mom says I
never did come home.''
</P>
<P>
   As in the film, Crowe's mother wanted him to be a lawyer.
Miller's shell-shocked airport reunion with his sister mirrors that
of Crowe, who left the Allman Brothers tour an emotional mess after
all of his tapes were confiscated by Gregg Allman. The character's
tireless attempt to interview guitarist Russell Hammond (Crudup) of
the fictional band Stillwater is inspired by Crowe's similar ordeal
with Led Zeppelin's Jimmy Page.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was Glenn Frey from the Eagles that said to me, `Come here,
come here. Look, I know a lot of people are telling you a lot of
stuff, but just make us look cool,' '' Crowe said.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I love the way Billy's character captures that in the
movie and the way Patrick's character kind of feels torn, because
he sort of belongs but he knows he can't belong because of what
Lester's told him. But he wants to serve Billy's character and he
wants to make him look cool, because he feels cool just standing
there. Hopefully, that messiness is all mixed up in the story of
our music.''
</P>
<P>
   Love of music is what unites ``Almost Famous''' characters, who
form a makeshift family on the road. Finding one's place in the
world is a recurring theme in Crowe's films, which also include
``Say Anything . . .'' and ``Singles.'' His first cinematic effort
was the screenplay for ``Fast Times at Ridgemont High,'' which he
adapted from his best-selling novel.
</P>
<P>
   ``I kind of like to write about disconnected families that (in)
some way belong together,'' Crowe said. ``Music, for me, gave me
that feeling that there were people out there that felt like I
did.''
</P>
<P>
   Crowe said one thing he hoped to accomplish with the film was to
help reunite his mother and sister, who, like their screen
counterparts, have been estranged for many years. ``That bridge is
almost built at this point, because they are able to laugh a little
bit at themselves and hug awkwardly _ hopefully,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A nationwide casting search for the central role of Crowe's
fictionalized younger self led to Fugit, a teen-age actor from Utah
whose experience was limited to three appearances on television's
``Touched by an Angel ``and two episodes of ``Promised Land.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to find someone that captured the way it felt back
then to be a fan and to be wide open and to just be so happy to be
at the circus and slightly afraid that you might get thrown out at
any given point,'' Crowe said. ``I felt that in Patrick's eyes was
really the feeling that I remembered so clearly. And the hairdo,''
he said, laughing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Actually, Cameron was really easygoing about me making him
look kind of dorky,'' Fugit said. ``He didn't want me to play
Cameron Crowe, 15 years old _ he wanted me to play William Miller.
He really emphasized that. So we basically came up with our own
character and added a little bit of Cameron in it.''
</P>
<P>
   Fugit didn't listen to music before landing the role. Crowe
offered him his forgiveness and a huge stack of CDs. ``He said this
is rock, enjoy it,'' said Fugit, now a big fan of Led Zeppelin and
Pink Floyd.
</P>
<P>
   Crowe used music to help the actors find their characters and to
create moods on the set. He played Joni Mitchell to set the tone
for Hudson's Penny Lane and Bruce Springsteen for Crudup's Russell
Hammond.
</P>
<P>
   The filmmaker co-wrote Stillwater's six original songs with his
wife, Heart singer-guitarist Nancy Wilson, who composed the film's
score, and Peter Frampton, who served as the film's technical
consultant and makes a cameo appearance as Reg, the tour manager
for Humble Pie.
</P>
<P>
   Crowe enrolled Stillwater _ actors Crudup (''Jesus' Son'') and
Lee (''Chasing Amy'') and musicians Mark Kozelek and John Fedevich
_ in what affectionately became known as Rock 'n' Roll School,
where they learned to perform as a band under Frampton's tutelage.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cameron insisted on us finding, over a period of time, our own
way of performing that was unique and specific to us _ with
guidance, because we were doing in five weeks what people do in
five years,'' Crudup said. ``But it was focused on us developing
our own style, based upon who the characters were that we were
creating at the same time.''
</P>
<P>
   Lee, who plays lead singer Jeff Bebe, felt uncertain about what
he was supposed to be doing until Crowe showed him tapes of Paul
Rodgers performing with Free. He took his inspiration from the
simplicity of Rodgers' style and slowly started to find his place.
</P>
<P>
   ``I found myself liking the music and letting it do its thing
and not having to think about it anymore,'' Lee said. ``That's when
I realized that's what it was like for these guys. It's about the
music, the adrenaline you get.''
</P>
<P>
   Lee said the concert sequence shot before 2,000 screaming extras
at the Hollywood Palladium, which doubled for the arena in
Cleveland, made it feel very real.
</P>
<P>
   ``I fed off of that energy that I got from these extras . . .,
and I had long forgotten at that point what I was supposed to be
doing. And frankly, I rocked.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Almost Famous'' is about the power of music to transport the
listener, with Hoffman's Bangs raging into the void against the
rise of corporate record industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think as long as you can be alone in a room with music, you
can feel that deep connection,'' Crowe said, regarding music's
contemporary relevance. ``You see it in people driving in cars all
the time, just singing along alone. They look over and see you and
they immediately stop, because it's so embarrassing how deeply
they're getting into it.''
</P>
<P>
   The one thing that Crowe wanted to capture in the movie, though,
is that rock has become what he calls a television sport.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's just a lot more money involved, and so it becomes a
sport _ it becomes a spectacle. Thank goodness there's always clubs
and there's always a great band that you can go see and just share
it with a few people.''
</P>
<P>
   Not that the spectacle doesn't have its time and place. Crowe
said his young niece connects with Britney Spears the same way that
he used to connect with the Who.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to hail that at the same time you're saying
remember how it used to be,'' Crowe said, ``because you never want
to be old Gramps, talking about Led Zeppelin.''

 &HT;    `Almost Famous' ROCKS
 &HT;    By Dave Larsen
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Passionate devotion to rock music has inspired
two of this year's best films, Stephen Frears' ``High Fidelity''
and Cameron Crowe's ``Almost Famous.''
</P>
<P>
   The latter is a romanticized memoir from the Academy
Award-nominated writer-director of ``Jerry Maguire,'' who spent his
teen-age years on the road with the likes of Led Zeppelin and
Lynryd Skynyrd as a reporter for ``Rolling Stone'' magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Written from the heart with the voice of experience, Crowe's
fictionalized coming-of-age story is funny, insightful and
bittersweet. The terrific film may be a tough sell for DreamWorks,
with no big-name stars and a bad title, but it's the year's first
certain Oscar contender.
</P>
<P>
   Set in 1973, ``Almost Famous'' re-creates rock music's golden
era in all of its glamour, promise and excess _ before it became
``an industry of cool,'' in the caustic words of Lester Bangs, the
legendary rock critic who was Crowe's real-life mentor.
</P>
<P>
   Crowe clearly identifies with the story's central characters,
who all share a consuming passion for music. Avoiding the pitfall
of becoming a ``Spinal Tap''-style satire or spoof, the film
authentically depicts the life of a touring band from the
perspective of a wide-eyed observer, who finds his place in the
world among a makeshift rock 'n' roll family.
</P>
<P>
   William Miller (Patrick Fugit) is a 15-year-old San Diego high
school student who becomes an avid music fan after his older
sister, Anita (Zooey Deschanel), walks out on their controlling
mother, Elaine (Frances McDormand), leaving him her stash of
records.
</P>
<P>
   Precocious William is soon writing band profiles for the local
papers. He befriends Bangs (Philip Seymour Hoffman), an
uncompromising journalist who warns Miller not to make friends with
the musicians he interviews, advising him to be ``honest and
unmerciful.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller is assigned to cover a Black Sabbath concert for Creem
magazine. Failing to get backstage because of his youthful
appearance _ the groupies dub him ``Opie'' _ he gains entry with
the opening act, the up-and-coming band Stillwater, whom he
impresses with his detailed knowledge of their latest album.
</P>
<P>
   He parlays his relationship with the band, which includes
charismatic guitarist Russell Hammond (Billy Crudup) and
egotistical singer Jeff Bebe (Jason Lee), into an assignment from
Rolling Stone magazine to write a 3,000-word piece on Stillwater,
joining the contentious group and its devoted ``band aids'' on a
chaotic cross-country tour.
</P>
<P>
   Miller struggles to remain objective amid the heady atmosphere,
falling for an angelic groupie who calls herself Penny Lane (Kate
Hudson, daughter of Goldie Hawn and Bill Hudson) and doggedly
trying to pin down the elusive Hammond for an interview while
keeping his increasingly concerned Rolling Stone editor, Ben
Fong-Torres (Terry Chen), at bay with Bangs' assistance.
</P>
<P>
   Elaine remains a constant presence through a hilarious series of
inopportune phone calls, in which she forms a surprising bond with
Hammond.
</P>
<P>
   ``Almost Famous'' has a warmly infectious spirit, conveying the
first rush of discovering music, friendship, love and success _
along with the pleasures and pain they can bring.
</P>
<P>
   The story occasionally loses steam, but the film features many
amusing and memorable scenes, highlighted by Hammond's acid-fueled
declaration: ``I am a golden god!''
</P>
<P>
   Provided it finds an audience, ``Almost Famous'' should finally
makes stars of Crudup (''Jesus' Son'') and Hudson (''200
Cigarettes''), who both deliver outstanding performances.
</P>
<P>
   Fugit makes an impressive debut as Crowe's innocent, slightly
goofy counterpart, holding the film together despite the
circus-like surroundings.
</P>
<P>
   McDormand, who won an Oscar for ``Fargo,'' could earn a best
supporting actress nomination for her comically nuanced turn as
Miller's eccentric, protective mother.
</P>
<P>
   Crowe is an early favorite to score nods for best screenplay,
director and picture. His funny and touching ode to his past is
almost perfect.

ESEATED DECIDES TO SELL ASSETS VIA THE WEB 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEPHANIE STOUGHTON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Executives at eSeated.com, a Web company that books
restaurant reservations, swallowed their pride earlier this week
and, with a few mouse clicks, listed the company's assets on
auction site eBay.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most investors would blanch if you told them this was the way
you were going to sell the company,'' said Steve Lewis, who founded
the Cambridge company in October 1999. ``We blanched, too.''
</P>
<P>
   With an estimated $5 million in initial funding and support,
eSeated managed to sign up 40 companies representing about 200
restaurants in Chicago, Philadephia, New York and Boston.
</P>
<P>
   But the startup got a chilly reponse from investors when it
attempted to attract another round of $15 million in funds. So
eSeated.com opted to fold, joining Toysmart.com, CraftShop.com and
dozens of other Web businesses in the dot-com graveyard.
</P>
<P>
   ESeated isn't the first business to turn to San Jose-based eBay
for help in finding buyers. Although the auction site is better
known for its collection of antiques, used sporting goods and other
flea-market merchandise, it also features restaurants, Internet
service providers and Web sites for sale.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, consumers could bid $1 million for an Internet
transportation and travel business, or more than $49,000 for a
newly remodeled restaurant in Texas. Bidding on
OutdoorsmanVillage.com, a Web site for hunting and fishing
enthusiasts, started Wednesday at $100.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis said he turned to eBay because the company did not want to
reorganize its assets under Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.
Instead, he wanted a one-way ticket out of his embattled business,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the ultimate act of desperation in a very non-liquid
market,'' said Lewis.
</P>
<P>
   ESeated.com executives hope to raise several hundred thousand
dollars for its assets, which include computers, fax machines and
printers. By far the most valuable piece is the software code that
powers the Web site and restaurant reservation system. The closely
held firm did not disclose its total assets and liabilities.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis said he was proud of his company's robust technology and
progress in signing up popular restaurants like Radius and Anago in
Boston.
</P>
<P>
   But almost from the start, analysts have questioned whether
consumers would demand restaurant reservations services on the Web.
In addition, eSeated.com had faced stiff competition from
OpenTable.com, a similar service that books reservations at more
than 900 restaurants in 18 markets, including Boston.
</P>
<P>
   (OpenTable.com has formed marketing alliances with NYToday.com
and Boston.com _ both part of the The New York Times' Internet
division. The Boston Globe is owned by The New York Times Co.)
</P>
<P>
   Lewis started his company with the help of Andersen Consulting's
business launch center in Lexington, Mass. But when it was time to
move out, eSeated executives could not attract the necessary
financing.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, Lewis has moved the company to his own home in
Cambridge. ESeated, which once had eight employees, is now down to
Lewis and Mark Borges, the chief technology officer.
</P>
<P>
   According to Lewis, Andersen Consulting's business center gave
the company more than $2.5 million in technology consulting
services. Andersen Consulting also owned warrants for more than 1
million shares in eSeated.com, he said.
</P>
<P>
   An Andersen Consulting spokeswoman, however, said her company
received cash for its services and never exercised the warrants.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis said eSeated paid only $50,000 for technology consulting,
Web site building and other work. At one point, he said, more than
20 people from Andersen Consulting were working on the project.
</P>
<P>
   For now, Lewis said he isn't sure whether he'll return to the
dot-com world.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had friend from business school ask me if I want to get
involved in a (new) company,'' he said. But ``my wife is dead set
against another startup.''

   BOSTON _ Challenging long-held ideas about how diabetes

   The discovery, being reported Friday, is among several recent
and forthcoming findings that may be cracking open the riddle of
diabetes by probing it at the level of genes and proteins.
Diabetics' bodies produce inadequate insulin, the hormone that
regulates the conversion of blood-sugar into energy to fuel
activity.
</P>
<P>
   The Joslin researchers, led by Dr. C. Ronald Kahn, president &UR;  &LR; of
the renowned center, showed that blocking the effects of insulin in
the brain caused mice to overeat, gain weight, not respond properly
to insulin elsewhere in the body, and to produce fewer offspring.
</P>
<P>
   These are all conditions that occur in Type 2 diabetes, the form
that is usually (but not always) diagnosed in adults and is
associated with obesity. The only way in which the mice weren't
like diabetic mice was that they didn't have high blood sugar, said
Kahn in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   Kahn and his colleagues, writing in the journal Science, said
they created bioengineered mice whose brain cells lacked insulin
receptors _ structures that insulin molecules normally bind to,
like a key entering a lock. With the receptors absent, insulin
wouldn't be active in the brain, but the scientists didn't know
what the consequences would be.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think most people thought that if insulin and the insulin
receptors had any function at all, it would be in the development
of the brain,'' Kahn said.
</P>
<P>
   But in fact, the brains of the mice developed normally. To their
surprise the scientists found that the modified mice showed many
features of diabetes. The females ate more and got fatter even on a
normal diet, while the males and females both gained weight on a
high-fat diet.
</P>
<P>
   The mice's blood also contained more leptin than normal: leptin
is a signaling molecule that helps regulate appetite, but it didn't
seem very effective in these mice. And the mice had reduced
fertility because sperm and egg production was abnormal.
</P>
<P>
   Also, the female mice exhibited insulin resistance: that is,
doses of insulin injected into them failed to stop a rise in blood
sugar after they had eaten.
</P>
<P>
   The findings, Kahn said, ``force us to open our minds to the
idea that insulin action and resistance in the brain contribute in
some way'' to the development of diabetes. It doesn't mean, he
said, that most human diabetics have a damaged insulin receptor in
the brain _ that was just a tool to help determine what insulin, a
hormone, normally does.
</P>
<P>
   Federal officials recently reported that the prevalence of Type
2 diabetes has risen by one-third during the last decade, an
alarming discovery that's blamed mainly on obesity and inactivity,
especially in young people.
</P>
<P>
   Type 1 diabetes is the form that usually appears early in life
and patients with it frequently require insulin shots. Type 2
diabetes, much more prevalent, can often be treated with diet and
exercise.
</P>
<P>
   There's still much that's not understood about the immensely
complex system in the body that regulates how food is turned into
energy, and which goes wrong in diabetes.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists are beginning to uncover genes that carry mutations
which can contribute to diabetes. ``These insights will put us in a
better position the development of diabetes,'' Kahn said, as well
as to provide new targets for drugs to treat the disease.

  Emme collection a fitting alternative 
(For use after Sun., Sept. 24, 2000 by NYTimes News Service
clients) 
 
 
By BARBARA DeWITT 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Real women don't wear a size 2. Or even an 8.
</P>
<P>
   Most American women wear a size 12 or larger, according to
national statistics. And they demand to be stylishly dressed and
addressed by someone their size. Somebody who understands that just
cutting a dress bigger doesn't make it fit.
</P>
<P>
   It's Emme to the rescue.
</P>
<P>
   Emme _ the plus-size supermodel who's host of E! ``Fashion
Emergency,'' a Revlon spokesperson, author of the book ``True
Beauty _ Positive Attitudes &AMP; Practical Tips From the World's
Leading Plus Size Model'' and the ``Ask Emme'' columnist in Mode
magazine _ has somehow found time to launch a clothing line this
fall.
</P>
<P>
   The new Emme collection is geared to women 25 to 40 and has all
the looks women want. We're talking about designs that are
body-conscious, with wrap blouses, cropped pants, suede skirts and
menswear tweeds. Plus matte jersey dresses for the office that hide
figure flaws with trendy extra-long knit cardigans.
</P>
<P>
   The new L.A.-based Emme collection was designed by Cynthia
Tseng, who has worked for the local Laundry label as well as Liz
Claiborne. Tseng's sportswear expertise shows in the choice of
slenderizing solid shades of granite, asphalt and camel that can be
worn in monochromatic statements or as sporty separates; as well as
her use of heavier, four-way stretch fabrics that are kinder to
curves.
</P>
<P>
   Although she's not a lightweight, Emme is a vocal advocate for
women of all ages to be fit and healthy. Says Emme, ``We live in a
society that is based upon the attainment of unrealistic beauty. I
want women to know their self-esteem is not contingent upon their
dress size.''
</P>
<P>
   The Emme collection is for sizes 10 to 24 and is available at
leading department stores, priced at $69 to $119 each. &QL;

BUSH SOFT-SHOES THROUGH APPEARANCE ON `REGIS' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GLEN JOHNSON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Oprah Winfrey it was not.
</P>
<P>
   The governor of Texas, the Republican nominee for president, the
man who would be leader of the free world, Thursday donned a
monochromatic shirt and tie and took his campaign into one of
popular culture's quirkiest venues.
</P>
<P>
   It was George W. Bush _ the all-new-this-week,
couldn't-be-more-relaxed George W. Bush _ ``live'' with Regis
Philbin on his daytime show. Bush gabbed with a finalist from
``Survivor,'' bragged about watching ``Who Wants to be a
Millionaire?'' and exited, stage right, just before the next guest,
a man from Richmond, Ind., tried to set a record for breaking
boards with his head.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone needs a hobby, Regis,'' the man explained.
</P>
<P>
   Before Bush appeared, Judy B. Goode of St. Petersburg, Fla.
auditioned to be the successor to former co-host, Kathie Lee
Gifford, by performing singing impressions of entertainers such as
Cher and Carol Channing.
</P>
<P>
   Then it was on to the future of the presidency, and Bush was
asked a few questions unlikely to make the cut at the presidential
debates.
</P>
<P>
   Philbin asked about the origin of his nickname, ``W.''
</P>
<P>
   Susan Hawk, the tough-talking Wisconsin truck driver from
``Survivor'' who was serving as guest host, wondered, ``Do you have
a good plan on the Social Security?'' She answered herself, saying
she liked Bush's idea of allowing some Social Security taxes to be
invested in the stock market.
</P>
<P>
   When Bush explained that ``W'' came from the initial for his
middle name, Walker, Hawk cut in, as she did repeatedly, ``There's
a Texas ranger named Walker,'' referring to the TV series starring
Chuck Norris.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, he's a good friend of mine,'' the governor said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you know him?'' asked the fawning co-host.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, if the visit dwelled long on the amusing and the inane, it
was, for Bush, nonetheless purposeful. Bush went live with Regis
after a more serious interview on Tuesday with Oprah Winfrey. Both
Winfrey and Philbin have large female audiences, and Bush has
campaigned strenuously all week to build support among female
voters. Women currently support Bush's Democratic rival, Al Gore,
by a wide margin. The appearances have also been intended to
humanize Bush and to air his easygoing side, which was one of his
early strengths as a candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Bush did share some serious thoughts with Philbin, accusing the
Clinton administration of allowing gas prices to soar and warning
Saddam Hussein of ``serious consequences'' if the Iraqi president
is caught trading in weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas governor also said he accepts the fact that the best
person does not always win in politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't think so in 1992,'' Bush said, referring to the
election that his father, former president Bush, lost to Bill
Clinton. ``The only thing I know to do is just to speak my mind,
tell people what's on my heart, let the chips fall where they may.
I trust Americans, I do, I trust the American people.''
</P>
<P>
   The light tone of the 20-minute interview was set when Bush
walked out wearing a gray suit, navy shirt, and dark blue silk tie.
The garb, suggested by golfer Ben Crenshaw when Bush had dinner
with him on Sunday, was a take-off on Philbin's style and new line
of clothing.
</P>
<P>
   ``He gave Oprah a kiss, but he wore my shirt and tie,'' Philbin
proudly told his audience.
</P>
<P>
   Bush admitted he tuned in to the summer's television hit, the
CBS show ``Survivor.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I did (watch) coming down the stretch in particular,'' he
said. ``I was fascinated to see who was going to survive, kind of
like me. I feel like I'm going through `Survivor.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Bush said the last movie he saw was ``Saving Private Ryan,'' on
videotape. ``I haven't been to a movie house in a long time,'' he
said. ``There aren't enough tickets to pay for the entourage.''
Bush also said he occasionally watches Philbin's nighttime show,
``Who wants to Be a Millionaire,'' and tries to guess the correct
answers all the way up to the $1 million level.
</P>
<P>
   The audience cooed as Philbin showed baby pictures of Bush, and
then Hawk interrupted again when a photo of Bush on a pony named
``Widow Maker'' flashed on the screen.
</P>
<P>
   ``I loved my first pony,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You had a pony?'' the nominee asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a pony, 8 years old, I had a pony, `Sugar.' ''
</P>
<P>
   `` `Sugar?' In Wisconsin?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh yeah, I had it for the longest time, and then it got to
when I had to sell it, I cried so hard. I was just a little girl.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Philbin interrupted the banter, deadpanning,
``Governor, you got a minute?''

SUICIDE UNDERSCORES PROBLEM OF BAD DEBT IN JAPANESE FINANCIAL
SYSTEM 
</HEADLINE>
   By STEPHANIE STROM   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ The suicide of the new president of Nippon Credit Bank,
which was saved from insolvency earlier this month by a group of
investors led by the Softbank Corp., has stunned Japan's banking
industry. And it has underscored the human misery caused by the
burden of bad debt that continues to vex the Japanese financial
system.
</P>
<P>
   Tadayo Honma, a former senior official of the nation's central
bank who joined the investor group in February, apparently hanged
himself from a curtain rod in a hotel while on a business trip to
western Japan. His body was found early Wednesday by his secretary.
</P>
<P>
   Nippon Credit said a managing director, Yoshinobu Kodera, would
be acting president until a replacement for Honma was found.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still can't believe what has happened,'' said Masaaki Kanno,
a senior economist at J.P. Morgan in Tokyo, who had worked with
Honma at the central bank. ``We're all in shock.''
</P>
<P>
   It is hardly unprecedented for high-ranking Japanese executives
to commit suicide in the face of a scandal or when their businesses
are under extreme duress, and the number of banking executives who
have killed themselves has increased in the last several years as
the financial industry's condition worsened.
</P>
<P>
   But Honma did not quite face those problems. Bank officials and
friends said that they knew of no health troubles, and that Honma,
while not a jolly man, was not given to depression. ``He was quite
popular among younger people at the bank, very open and
approachable,'' Kanno said.
</P>
<P>
   Honma had spent much of the last year helping Softbank, Japan's
largest Internet investment company, and its partners, the Orix
Corp. and Tokio Marine and Fire Insurance, negotiate a deal to buy
Nippon Credit from the Japanese government, which had nationalized
the bank in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The deal was completed on Sept. 1, after it had nearly collapsed
when a number of big companies were asking their banks to forgive
loans.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the deal, the government pledged to make good on any
Nippon Credit loan that lost more than 20 percent of its value at
the time of the sale, meaning that responsibility for loan
forgiveness could be shifted to the government. Such a provision
raised the prospect that public money would be used to bail out
private companies.
</P>
<P>
   That was politically unpalatable, and senior politicians pressed
bank regulators to renegotiate that provision, leading to a
one-month delay in completing the sale.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, the politicians realized that they could not both
alter the terms of the sale and maintain credibility, and they
grudgingly allowed it to go through on Sept. 1, having rebuked
banking regulators during parliament debate in August for having
agreed to such a provision.
</P>
<P>
   Honma was involved in that controversy, according to officials
in the Softbank group. ``He had been under a great deal of
stress,'' one executive said. ``The strain of dealing with the
authorities over the last several months, particularly in August,
was intense.''
</P>
<P>
   For their part, the authorities suggested that tensions within
the investor group may have affected Honma. There were rumors that
he disagreed with Softbank on several matters, including the
disposal of bad debts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have heard that his psychological stress was mounting
because he was placed in a dilemma over the interests of the three
partners,'' said Hideyuki Aizawa, the head of the Financial
Reconstruction Commission, the agency responsible for overhauling
the Japanese financial system. ``I heard that the three companies
requested various things.''
</P>
<P>
   Pressure on Honma did not abate after the purchase of Nippon
Credit. While the government spent 3.2 trillion yen, or nearly $30
billion _ almost as much as it plans to allocate for a supplemental
budget to keep the national economy afloat _ to clean up Nippon
Credit's books, it left about 1.2 billion yen in questionable
loans, or one-third of the bank's loan portfolio, on the books.
</P>
<P>
   Not only did Honma have to rebuild business at a time of
particularly intense competition, but he also had to continue
wrestling with the bad loans.
</P>
<P>
   And he knew perhaps better than anyone else how bad those loans
were. He was the executive director of the financial and payment
systems department at the Japanese central bank in 1997, when
Nippon Credit was given its first bailout. According to several
former and current central bank officials, Honma worked hard to
persuade several insurance companies, other banks and Nippon Credit
shareholders to then recapitalize the bank.
</P>
<P>
   He was also one of the top officials dealing with the failure of
the Yamaichi Securities Co. in December 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Those ordeals, in a way, made his suicide more mysterious than
some others. ``This is a guy who lived through some of the biggest
battles in the Japanese financial system,'' said Marshall Gittler,
a currency strategist at the Bank of America and longtime
specialist on the Japanese financial markets. ``Was there any more
pressure at Nippon Credit Bank than there was when Yamaichi went
under? I find that hard to believe.''

`DANCER IN THE DARK': LIFE COULDN'T BE WORSE, COULD IT? 
</HEADLINE>
  (Production notes at end of review) 
 By A.O. SCOTT    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ ``I've seen it all; there's nothing left to see.''
These words are sung, with keening defiance, by Selma, a Czech
emigre working in a factory and raising her son alone somewhere in
Eisenhower-era America, who is going blind from a hereditary
disease. Her response to the impending loss of her sight is a
joyful shrug: ``To be perfectly honest, I really don't care.''
</P>
<P>
   The song _ one of several written by the Icelandic pop singer
Bjork, who plays Selma, and Lars von Trier, the Danish director of
``Dancer in the Dark'' _ expresses a sentiment that seems to attack
the most basic foundations of the movie, indeed of cinema itself,
which is after all an art built around the miraculous act of
seeing.
</P>
<P>
   It's a suitably paradoxical sentiment. Von Trier is a belated
outrider of the 20th-century European avant-garde, suspicious of
the very possibility of novelty and desperate to make something
new, hungry for an audience yet proudly contemptuous of his
audience's complacency. His recent films _ ``Breaking the Waves,''
``The Idiots'' and now ``Dancer in the Dark,'' which opens the 38th
New York Film Festival Friday night and will be released
commercially Saturday _ induce powerful, even unbearable emotions
but refuse, in the usual sense, to move you. At the end, you are
exactly where you were to start with: In the dark.
</P>
<P>
   And this may be the point. Where else should a movie leave you?
Why should you expect to be transported? Von Trier is, among other
things, a chief propagandist of the Dogma movement, a flamboyantly
literal-minded approach to filmmaking aimed at smashing everything
jaded and phony about contemporary cinema. He has now used the
movement's precepts to make an entirely self-enclosed, willfully
artificial and curiously stylized picture.
</P>
<P>
   The emerging critical line on ``Dancer in the Dark'' is that it
will polarize audiences, that you'll either love it or hate it. And
while it's true that this is a film about which no one can remain
neutral, it's also true that neutrality is not the same as
ambivalence. The movie is both stupefyingly bad and utterly
overpowering; it can elicit, sometimes within a single scene, a
gasp of rapture and a spasm of revulsion. Come to the theater
prepared, with a handkerchief in one hand and a rotten tomato in
the other.
</P>
<P>
   The notorious Dogma rules challenge the conventions of cinematic
illusionism by insisting on hand-held cameras and naturally
occurring light and sound. ``Dancer in the Dark,'' like any
worthwhile piece of art, flouts its own enabling aesthetic rules at
will. It harks back to the florid melodramas and opulent MGM
musicals of the 1950s, but with a dogmatic twist. The musical
numbers, which take place in Selma's imagination to the found music
of machinery, train wheels and her own heart beat, were shot with
100 stationary digital video cameras. Their coming is signaled by a
subtle shift in the film's palette, as the washed-out, beige hues
of everyday life suddenly glow like an old revival-house print of
``Singin' in the Rain.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the course of more than two hours, the viewer is thrown
from moments of harrowing realism _ scenes whose jumpy rhythm and
raw immediacy make you feel as if you're peeking through the window
at a moment of private misery _ and flights of fantastic absurdity.
The one constant presence _ and the single force that keeps the
movie from collapsing under its contradictory ambitions _ is Selma.
If you saw ``Breaking the Waves,'' which had its U.S. premiere at
the festival in 1996, then you may think you've seen her before.
Once again, von Trier has imagined a stubborn, simple-minded woman
who is also the embodiment of selfless, innocent goodness, and has
trained his digital camera on her utter and systematic
annihilation.
</P>
<P>
   Selma's son, Gene, suffers from the same condition she does. In
addition to her job making metal sinks at a tool and die factory,
she cards bobby pins, saving her money for the operation that will
save the boy's sight. At first, she seems to dwell in a cocoon of
protection, looked after by her friend Kathy (Catherine Deneuve),
her infatuated co-worker Jeff (Peter Stormare) and the local
policeman and his wife (David Morse and Cara Seymour), from whom
she rents her sparsely furnished trailer. She spends her evenings
rehearsing the part of Maria in a community theater production of
``The Sound of Music'' and her spare time at the movies, where
Kathy tells her what's happening on screen and, in a lovely moment,
dances her fingers across Selma's palm to convey the spirit of a
Busby Berkeley dance number.
</P>
<P>
   But soon Selma is sucked into a vortex of misfortune that _
through a sequence of events that don't withstand the slightest
skeptical scrutiny _ lands her on death row. The sheer
improbability of the story is a sign of von Trier's audacity. I
don't think he expects anyone to swallow the business about the eye
disease (which must be corrected before a victim's 13th birthday),
or a murder trial that seems to have been inspired by watching
poorly dubbed episodes of ``Law and Order'' on Danish television.
</P>
<P>
   He seems rather to be conducting a diabolical experiment, to
determine if the virtuosic brutality of his style can manipulate
the audience into feeling what it cannot believe. And the
experiment is remarkably successful, especially in the film's
devastating final scenes.
</P>
<P>
   If nothing else, von Trier is a brilliant engineer of dread;
Selma's every moment seems to contain the possibility of suffering,
humiliation or betrayal. She wears her guileless, faltering
vulnerability like a target on her back, and the movie follows her
through the stations of her martyrdom like a medieval pageant.
</P>
<P>
   And once again, von Trier's methods elicit a performance from
his lead actress that deserves to be called miraculous. Like Emily
Watson in ``Breaking the Waves,'' Bjork, in her movie debut, seems
to be inventing a new style of film acting, if not an entirely new
kind of human being. Her eyes are obscured behind thick glasses and
the high cliffs of her cheekbones, but Selma's capacity for feeling
_ for joy as well as agony and terror _ overwhelms her mousiness.
</P>
<P>
   When she hears a song she likes, her tongue darts out between
her teeth, and her anxiety registers in her hands and in the
tendons of her neck.
</P>
<P>
   Like Watson's Bess McNeal in ``Breaking the Waves,'' Selma is
sacrificed on the altar of intellectual bad faith. The earlier film
was about the collision between repressive religious orthodoxy and
pagan sexual spiritualism, and this one posits an equally schematic
conflict between the liberating power of pure imagination and the
intractable authority of the market and the state.

   It may be, though, that the real struggle we're witnessing on
screen is between Bjork and von Trier, between artistic conviction
and aestheticized cynicism. It's hard to say who wins, and
impossible to avert our eyes. ``Dancer in the Dark'' is one of the
most sadistic films I've ever seen, but it also raises the
possibility that sadism might be, in spite of itself, a species of
love.

TEACHER HEADS TO EAST TIMOR IN HUMAN RIGHTS ROLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHARLES A. RADIN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Mark Salzer's life started to change the night his
desperately poor host family in Mexico, who had not eaten meat in
months, stole a goat and slaughtered it in their home.
</P>
<P>
   Before that, Salzer led the uncomplicated life of an
upper-middle-class Princeton undergraduate, honing his pool shot as
he ambled toward law school. He ``certainly would not have condoned
stealing'' under any circumstances, he says.
</P>
<P>
   ``I learned a different reality'' in the hardscrabble villages
of Mexico. That reality redefined his career path, leading him to
international human rights work, to what he calls ``direct relief''
work at the Pine Street Inn, and to teaching in the Boston public
schools.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, if the schedule holds, that path will take Salzer, 36;
his wife, Rebecca Wyse, 33, and their 2-year-old son, Emmett, on
the first leg of a journey to help the people of East Timor, the
world's newest nation.
</P>
<P>
   This family's odyssey is its essence.
</P>
<P>
   Salzer and Wyse, until recently a nurse at the Fenway Community
Health Center, met when she had a patient at Pine Street who spoke
only Spanish. She called for a translator. Salzer came.
</P>
<P>
   Their lives bear witness to the profound effect social service
work can have on privileged youth, and provide some insight into
the current movement against globalization.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting in their apartment this week amid the last boxes headed
for storage, Salzer recalls going to Timor in 1992 because he
wanted to see the places where the world's little-known tragedies
were occurring. He came away feeling ``something was really
wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   East Timor, colonized by Portugal in the 16th century, declared
independence when the Portuguese withdrew in the 1970s, but was
invaded and subjugated by Indonesia. When Salzer visited in 1992,
it was a place where ``you were watched, and people would cross the
street to avoid being seen with you.''
</P>
<P>
   Abductions and torture were commonplace. One man waited in the
bushes outside his hotel for hours to give him a note to pass to
the International Red Cross about his brother, who was being held
incommunicado without his diabetes medication.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came back and saw the cozy relationship between the US
government and the Indonesian government, I saw the US was
complicit in this devastation and wanted to do something,'' he
said. ``I can understand the realpolitik point of view, but it is
not right.''
</P>
<P>
   Salzer returned briefly to the human rights agency where he had
been working in Washington, then moved to Boston in 1993 ``because
I knew there was a progressive community here. I was interested in
connecting.'' He went to work at Pine Street, and became
Boston-area coordinator of the East Timor Action Network, a
nationwide volunteer group dedicated to increasing public awareness
and shaping US policy on the situation.
</P>
<P>
   While at Pine Street, he read ``Savage Inequality,'' Jonathan
Kozol's book on the neglect and brutalization of the poor in the US
education system; he applied to teach in the Boston schools, though
his degree from Princeton was in philosophy and he had no formal
training as a teacher.
</P>
<P>
   He was granted an emergency waiver to teach science at the Mary
Curley Middle School because no one else was willing to do the
work. Except for a year when he won a Conant Fellowship at Harvard
and used it to earn a degree from the graduate school of education
there, he was at the Curley until he decided to go to East Timor.
</P>
<P>
   The decision followed his longstanding activism on behalf of the
East Timorese and also reflected his sense that he was being ground
down by school administrators who would not let him teach in a way
that influenced, rather than controlled, his students.
</P>
<P>
   That sort of thinking about relationships extends directly to
his upcoming work in East Timor, where he will be working for La'o
Hamutuk, an effort of international activists and East Timorese
formed to increase local participation in reconstruction and
development projects.
</P>
<P>
   Though unemployment is high, ``the World Bank flew in folks from
Australia to paint the outside of their offices, they paid to house
them,'' he said. ``Many of the international aid agencies' workers
are housed on a cruise ship in Dili harbor staffed by Filipinos.
Why not rebuild the hotels?''
</P>
<P>
   Salzer and Wyse stress their interest in other cultures, and in
watching a new nation build itself, attracts them to East Timor,
not any idea that social justice work there is different from
social justice work here.
</P>
<P>
   ``People don't have to go halfway around the world to do good,''
Wyse says. ``I don't think what we're doing is any bigger or better
than people who do the best they can here. You can make a
difference anywhere.''

A RARE STROLL IN THE GARDEN; A ROTHSCHILD COLLECTION FOR SALE
</HEADLINE>
  (Attn: Conn.)  
 By CAROL VOGEL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ When Sotheby's and Christie's are finishing their
plans for the annual November evening sales of impressionist and
modern art, it always adds an air of mystery to have an important
painting the public has not seen for decades. That's the case this
year for Sotheby's, which will be offering Manet's ``Woman in a
Garden,'' a luscious impressionist landscape that was last shown 47
years ago, in an exhibition in Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   The painting carries a selling price estimated at $20 million to
$30 million and will be offered in New York on Nov. 9. It is an
unusually large canvas _ 60 1/2 by 46 inches _ and depicts an
American woman, a friend of the artist known only as Mademoiselle
Marguerite, reading in the garden behind a Paris house Manet rented
in the summer of 1880.
</P>
<P>
   The richly painted canvas is seen as an important example of his
plein-air painting and of the style that marked Manet's mature
period, during the height of impressionism. It is the last of
several Manet paintings of women posed in a garden.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bravura brushwork, the scale of the painting and the vivid
effects of light filtered through the foliage make it particularly
rare,'' said David Norman, who runs Sotheby's impressionist and
modern art department in New York.
</P>
<P>
   The painting's provenance is also a big draw: it was in Manet's
family until 10 years ago. The seller is a collector who is
maintaining anonymity but who art experts say is not American.
There are only a few potential buyers at this price range, but
Norman said the diminishing availability of works this important,
particularly those by Manet, would make ``Woman in a Garden''
especially desirable.
</P>
<P>
   ``Among the impressionists, Manet is the rarest,'' Norman said.
</P>
<P>
   Who are the potential buyers? ``In terms of museums we always
think of the Getty and the Kimbell,'' he said. ``But there are also
collectors in fields like telecommunications who are big buyers
these days. When you get up this high, the air definitely gets
thinner.''
</P>
<P>
   Sotheby's is quietly betting that the painting will set a record
for Manet, outselling his 1878 painting ``Rue Mosnier With Flags,''
which sold for $26 million at Christie's in New York in November
1989.
</P>
<P>
   FIT FOR A BARONESS
</P>
<P>
   As powerful as the Rothschild name is in the world of banking,
it also carries a special cachet in art and antiques circles. The
family represents generations of the best kind of collecting, from
museum-quality old master paintings and French furniture to more
esoteric objects like rare scientific instruments and Islamic
glass.
</P>
<P>
   So when Christie's announced this week that in December it would
sell a group of old master paintings, Islamic and Venetian glass,
porcelains and jewelry belonging to the Baroness Batsheva de
Rothschild, who died five months ago, the auction house knew that
it had a ready-made winner. The sale will take place in London.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rothschild taste represents the golden age in Holland, the
golden age in France and the golden age in England,'' said Lord
Hindlip, chairman of Christie's. ``Their taste reflects the
fashions of the very best of a certain period.''
</P>
<P>
   The sale will not be Christie's first London sale of Rothschild
property. In July 1999, Christie's sale of treasures looted by the
Nazis and returned to the Rothschild family by the Austrian
government totaled $90 million. December's auction will not be
nearly so large: the total is conservatively estimated to fetch $22
million.
</P>
<P>
   Highlights include a group of old master paintings, to be sold
on Dec. 13, that include Rembrandt's ``Portrait of a Lady, Aged
62,'' signed and dated 1632. Depicting an anonymous woman, clad in
black with a white collar and cap setting off her face, its
estimate is $5.6 million to $8.4 million. There are also two
Watteaus, the most valuable of which is ``Italian Comedians in a
Landscape,'' estimated to bring $2.1 million to $2.8 million. It
shows an amorous cavalier on bended knee and a guitar-playing
woman. There are two exceptional Fragonards; one, ``A Blond Woman
With Two Doves,'' is expected to sell for $2.1 million to $3.5
million.
</P>
<P>
   On Dec. 14, Christie's will offer the Islamic and Venetian
glass, furniture and porcelain. Among the stars in this group is an
enameled lamp made for Sultan al-Nasir Muhammad, which is expected
to sell for $705,400 to $1.1 million.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the collection was assembled by Baron Alphonse de
Rothschild, Baroness Batsheva's grandfather, in the 19th century.
Baroness Batsheva, who lived in Jerusalem until her death, was part
of the fifth generation of the French branch of the family.
</P>
<P>
   ARRIVALS
</P>
<P>
   Two museum appointments were announced this week. Kate M.
Sellers will become the eighth director of the Wadsworth Atheneum
Museum of Art in Hartford, Conn., replacing Peter C. Sutton, who
announced that he would not be returning from a sabbatical.
Sellers, deputy director of the Cleveland Museum of Art, will
arrive on Nov. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Julia Brown, curator of special exhibitions at the Solomon R.
Guggenheim Museum, will become director of the American Federation
of the Arts, the country's oldest nonprofit art museum service
organization, on Nov. 1. She replaces Serena Rattazzi, who is
retiring after 10 years in the post.
</P>
<P>
   AND A DEPARTURE
</P>
<P>
   Another old-timer is leaving Sotheby's. This week, after months
of speculation, John Block announced his resignation. A nearly
30-year veteran, Block has been vice chairman of Sotheby's North
America, co-chairman of Sotheby's jewelry department worldwide and
a senior auctioneer. He plans to leave at the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   His departure will leave a second big hole in Sotheby's jewelry
department. In June, Prince Dimitri of Yugoslavia left after 15
years. The two men were the company's top business generators in
one of the most profitable areas of the auction business.

IRISH SUSPECTED IN ROCKET GRENADE ATTACK ON SPY SERVICE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN CULLEN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Law enforcement sources here and in Ireland say they
suspect Irish republican dissidents who want to destroy the peace
process fired a small rocket that damaged the building that houses
Britain's foreign intelligence service.
</P>
<P>
   The rocket-propelled grenade that crashed into the 8th floor of
an office of the Secret Intelligence Service, also known as MI6,
caused minimal damage Wednesday night. No one was hurt, but police
Thursday sealed off a huge area around Waterloo Station on the
south bank of the River Thames, causing chaos for drivers and
commuters.
</P>
<P>
   Although no group claimed responsibility for the attack, and the
Metropolitan Police publicly said they were keeping an open mind as
to who was behind it, senior law enforcement officials in the
Metropolitan Police, the Royal Ulster Constabulary and the Garda
Siochana, Ireland's national police force, privately said they
suspect the group that calls itself the Real IRA.
</P>
<P>
   If it were the Real IRA, it would mark the most brazen attack
yet by the group, which is opposed to the Irish Republican Army
cease-fire and the peace process, and its first use of
sophisticated weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday night, Metropolitan Police found part of a rocket
launcher they believe was used in the attack. Detectives were
trying to determine if the weapon was part of a cache that the Real
IRA acquired from the former Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecutors office at the International Criminal Tribunal
for the former Yugoslavia in The Hague Thursday told the Boston
Globe that they had linked a former Croatian general to the IRA.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago Croatian police arrested the former general, Ivan
Andabak, who is suspected of supplying the Real IRA with weapons,
including the type of handheld rocket-propelled grenade, or RPG,
launcher that was used in the attack on the MI6 building.
</P>
<P>
   Andabak was allegedly a senior Croatian military figure during
the war in Croatia in the mid-1990s and is suspected of being
involved in war crimes during that period. Paul Risley, a spokesman
for the war crimes prosecutor's office in The Hague, confirmed that
investigators from his office had interviewed Andabak last week.
</P>
<P>
   Risley said Andabak is believed to have received explosives
training from the IRA during the 1990s, and that he returned the
favor by procuring weapons for the breakaway group.
</P>
<P>
   Risley said Andabak was arrested by police in connection with
the assassination of a Bosnian Croat official who was blown up in
his car in an incident that closely resembled techniques perfected
by the IRA in the 1970s and 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Irish police recently intercepted a consignment of weapons from
Croatia bound for the Real IRA, but officials acknowledge some
weapons probably made it through to the dissident group.
</P>
<P>
   In singling out Irish terrorists for suspicion, police sources
cited the timing and symbolism of the target. Those sources said
they were convinced the attack was timed to influence Thursday's
election in Northern Ireland, where opponents of the Good Friday
Agreement of 1998, the compromise between Protestant unionists and
Catholic nationalists, were favored to win an open parliamentary
seat.
</P>
<P>
   MI6's existence was not even officially recognized until 1992,
although its large headquarters on the Thames is a well-known
landmark to many Londoners, and anyone who would harbor Irish
republican or other anti-British views.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout most of the conflict in Northern Ireland, the IRA's
attention was directed at MI5, Britain's domestic intelligence
agency. But when the Cold War ended a decade ago, the British
government authorized MI6 to direct covert activities at the IRA.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Irish republicans have regarded MI6 as a prime
target, partly because it captures the public imagination,
fictionally having been the employer of James Bond.
</P>
<P>
   Police on both sides of the Irish Sea believe the rocket attack
was aimed at angering Protestant unionists in Northern Ireland so
that they would vote for William McCrea, a member of the most
uncompromising of the Northern Ireland unionist parties, which
wants to destroy the power-sharing government created by the Good
Friday Agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Tim Pat Coogan, author of the definite study ``The IRA,'' said
the Real IRA, if he carried out the attack, may have been trying to
manipulate unionist opinion in Northern Ireland and boost morale
among its small cadre of activists.
</P>
<P>
   ``They want to show their people that they can strike at the
heart of the British establishment,'' said Coogan, who was at the
Irish embassy in London to launch his new book about the Irish
diaspora, ``Wherever Green is Worn.''
</P>
<P>
   Coogan said the dissident group is small but dangerous, and was
locked in an unspoken mutual alliance with hardline unionists.
``Strange bedfellows indeed,'' said Coogan.
</P>
<P>
   The Real IRA, a small but dangerous splinter group, consists of
mostly former IRA members who left that organization because they
disagree with the strategy of trying to bring about a united
Ireland through exclusively democratic politics.
</P>
<P>
   The Real IRA has been blamed for several recent bombings in
Northern Ireland, and for a bomb attack on Hammersmith Bridge in
London earlier this year. But police contend the group is not
claiming responsibility for the bombings because it officially
remains on cease-fire, and that its prisoners are eligible for
parole only as long as the group retains its cease-fire.
</P>
<P>
   The Real IRA called its cease-fire after its members placed a
bomb in Omagh in August 1998 that killed 29 people, the worst
atrocity in more than 30 years of a conflict the Irish call The
Troubles.

 &HT;    'Famous' plot even better than music
 &HT;    By Hap Erstein
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PALM BEACH, Fla. _ A little bit road picture, a little bit
coming-of-age story, a little rock 'n' roll nostalgia and more than
a little rose-colored autobiography. The wondrous thing about
``Almost Famous'' is that director-writer Cameron Crowe has cobbled
it together from so many familiar elements yet fashioned them into
something so entertaining and endearing.
</P>
<P>
   What kid hasn't yearned to leave home and join the circus? In
1973, a 15-year-old William Miller _ the fictional stand-in for
Crowe _ gets his chance, hopping the magical, mythical tour bus of
a middling, but still-seductive opening act rock band called
Stillwater to write a profile of the group for Rolling Stone
magazine.
</P>
<P>
   William's wary mother correctly fears that the trip will be her
son's rite-of-passage into a world of drugs, sex and umbilical
cord-cutting. In fact, it becomes an odyssey of discovery that
keeps getting extended when the group's charismatic lead guitarist,
Russell Hammond, continues to avoid being interviewed. Meanwhile,
William is losing all objectivity about the band while
simultaneously becoming madly smitten with a golden haired groupie
who goes by the name of Penny Lane.
</P>
<P>
   If entertainment writers respond personally to ``Almost
Famous,'' it could be for its on-target depiction of the efforts to
co-opt impressionable young scribes with the heady intoxication of
show business. William's mentor, real-life rock critic Lester Bangs
(played craftily by the always interesting Philip Seymour Hoffman)
puts it well when he warns the kid about rock performers:
``Friendship is the booze they feed you, (but) they are the
enemy.'' Of course, but they are an enemy to which William
willingly surrenders.
</P>
<P>
   Moviegoers of all stripes will surrender to the charms of the
radiant Kate Hudson, who makes Penny Lane such a cunning
combination of wisdom beyond her years and vulnerable naivete.
Hudson is the daughter of Goldie Hawn, and when she flashes her
megawatt grin, the resemblance is unmistakable. Her character may
get used badly by Russell, much to William's eye-opening chagrin,
but Hudson clearly relishes the role, channeling a time long before
she was born.
</P>
<P>
   With been-there assurance, Crowe evokes the early '70s (Where
does one get an Eastern airline jet these days?) and delivers the
sensory overload of a rock concert from the performers' viewpoint.
Where parody might be expected, Crowe substitutes unalloyed
affection. Surely he is more jaded today, yet he manages to mine
the uncritical excitement of hopelessly uncool William.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe the spontaneous group sing-along to Elton John's ``Tiny
Dancer'' never happened on the tour bus as depicted, but that is
how William/Cameron recalls it. Besides, you wouldn't want it any
other way. More forced is the incident where the band's airplane
gets caught in a life-threatening electric storm and incriminating
confessions come pouring out. But even Crowe's contrivances land
for potent emotional effect. As confident as his direction is, he
remains foremost a writer, and his screenplay is loaded with
character-rich comic nuggets.
</P>
<P>
   In his screen debut, cherubic Patrick Fugit gives a refreshingly
unmannered performance as William that centers the film. He holds
his own with the aptly egotistical Russell (Billy Crudup), for whom
equal parts attraction and repulsion is a natural response. If
``Almost Famous'' is a love-in to an era, it is also an
affectionate valentine to Crowe's mother, played with determination
and maternal apprehension by Frances McDormand.
</P>
<P>
   Lastly, there is the music, tiny time capsules hand-picked by
Crowe, ranging from the opening ``Chipmunk Song'' to Simon and
Garfunkel's elegiac ``America'' to the hard rocking Allman
Brothers' ``One Way Out,'' plus original songs by the movie's
technical advisers, Nancy Wilson of Heart (Crowe's wife) and Peter
Frampton.
</P>
<P>
   For once, though, here is a movie about rock music where the
performers and the story are even better than the soundtrack.
</P>
<P>
   ALMOST FAMOUS
</P>
<P>
   3 _ 1/2 stars
</P>
<P>
   Rated R: Drugs, sex, brief nudity, language
</P>
<P>
   Running time: 2 hours, 5 minutes
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: Crowe's autobiographical coming-of-age tale is an
affectionate tribute to a bygone era, to rock music and to his
worrywart mom.

 &HT;    The sounds of Santana follow a fan through life
 &HT;    By Robert Garcia
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GRAND JUNCTION, Colo. _ As a teen-ager in the late '60s, I would
often hear my parents play their favorite Mexican music. But I was
of the American Bandstand generation. To me the local top 40 was
it, but then one day I heard something very special. It was top 40
music with a unique sound. Music that incorporated the Latino
flavor my parents enjoyed, but with the rock 'n' roll I loved. The
sound was Santana.
</P>
<P>
   It was a time of cruisin', dancin' and Santana was the backdrop.
Santana's 1969 Woodstock performance propelled the band into
stardom, and such hits as ``Evil Ways'' and ``Black Magic Woman''
were heard everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   Music played a big part of what was going on in the '60s and
early '70s. Vietnam, the struggle for equality by women and
African-Americans all had certain music to attach to. In my
community, the Chicano civil rights movement adopted Santana's
sound, which was not quite Mexican, but not totally American. It
was music for a new generation.
</P>
<P>
   As disco music began to be the rage of the mid-'70s, I had moved
on to the Boulder campus and discovered alternative radio. What I
heard was that Santana had also moved on. Exposure to jazz-fusion
had resulted in a new sound, but still with Latin roots. Santana
had left behind the rock and drug scene for avant-garde jazz and
Eastern spirituality.
</P>
<P>
   For many of us longtime fans it took time to not just hear, but
``listen'' to Santana's new direction. No longer heard on
commercial radio, I had to aggressively seek out this new music.
</P>
<P>
   By the mid-'80s I had settled into family and work life and, in
my opinion, Santana and other musicians of his generation had
settled for mediocrity. Santana recordings I bought from that era
are some I play least, but hey, I was a fan.
</P>
<P>
   The 1990s saw Santana venturing out once again by hooking up
with such noted musicians as John Lee Hooker and jazz man Wayne
Shorter. During this decade he headlined the Woodstock '94
Festival, was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and had
a star placed on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.
</P>
<P>
   I was happy to see the worldwide recognition. While many may
have perceived these honors for someone whose time had passed, I
knew that Santana was very much alive and well, creating new music
and contributing to society. Some things I remember about Santana
are the numerous concert fund-raisers, dedicating a compact disc to
the late United Farm Workers leader Cesar Chavez, free Christmas
concerts for San Quentin inmates and creation of the Milagro
Foundation to help children worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of children, a couple of years ago my son joined me for
a show and it was a pleasure to see that the magic of Santana's
guitar had captured yet another generation.
</P>
<P>
   The incredible success of his latest CD, ``Supernatural,'' does
not surprise me. His willingness to experiment has always enriched
his sound.
</P>
<P>
   In the end I find it interesting that many rave about Santana's
great comeback, because for me, he never went away.

 &HT;    Kenneth Cole mixes politics and pleasure with his fresh
inaugural collection
 &HT;    By Staci Sturrock
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Kenneth Cole has always worn his convictions
on his black leather sleeve. His first show of women's wear was no
exception.
</P>
<P>
   And what a spot for his inaugural collection! Located in Grand
Central Station's glorious Vanderbilt Hall, just off the main
concourse, the runway stretched beneath five huge gilt chandeliers.
A dozen stagehands manned spotlights from two stories up, to make
sure the models were always well-lit on the marble below.
</P>
<P>
   But despite the Gilded Age trappings, the clothes, and Cole's
humor, were firmly planted in the here and now.
</P>
<P>
   Preceding the show was a short video intended to drum up
enthusiasm for voting. It starred ``The Daily Show's'' Jon Stewart,
who commented on the abysmally low voter turnout rate among
18-year-olds, ``which is sad until you realize these are the same
people who can't get your order right at Starbucks.'' (A chuckle
from the latte-swilling fashion gang.)
</P>
<P>
   The video then cut to interviews with New York politicians and
wannabes: Ed Koch, Mario Cuomo and Hillary Rodham Clinton, with the
latter joking about the possibility of citizens wearing special
ensembles just for use when they head into the voting booth.
</P>
<P>
   (A couple of political types attended the live show, too _
Karenna Gore Schif and Ronald Reagan Jr.)
</P>
<P>
   The five-minute video ended with Stewart deadpanning, ``Now
you're going to have to buy some clothes. Or no one's leaving. I'm
not kidding.''
</P>
<P>
   One wouldn't mind buying some of Cole's new creations, which
were presented as two virtually indistinguishable collections, the
designer's lower-end Reaction label as well as Kenneth Cole New
York. A metallic leather trench, however hip, definitely fell into
the splurge category, but a delicate white tank with ruffle
detailing down the front looked fresh and summery.
</P>
<P>
   Most designers hand out notes identifying each of the models and
explaining what the mannequin is wearing.
</P>
<P>
   Not Cole, who is always on the stump for a cause if not his
career. He decorated each seat with a Rock the Vote pamphlet.

 &HT;    'Sabrina' will remain light-hearted comedy
 &HT;    By Kevin D. Thompson
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Panties and a smile.
</P>
<P>
   That's all Melissa Joan Hart wore for last year's racy Maxim
cover. As the wholesome star of ``Sabrina, the Teenage Witch,''
Hart's fans were already familiar with the bewitching grin. But the
va-va-voomy black lingerie was a stunning eye-opener _ as was this
cover line: ``Sabrina, Your Favorite Witch Without A Stitch.''
</P>
<P>
   And that's not all. Hart cursed (!), talked about downing
tequila shots (!!) and explained the difference between good and
great sex (!!!). The publisher of Archie Comics, which owns the
``Sabrina'' property, wasn't amused. He wanted her booted off the
show.
</P>
<P>
   Hart, who landed her first television commercial at age 4, says
she never understood all the fuss.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was old enough to do that kind of shoot without it being a
scandal,'' says the 24-year-old actress, who was promoting her
movie, ``Drive Me Crazy,'' at the time. ``If it wasn't for Regis
and Kathie Lee talking about it every morning and the New York Post
printing it every week, no one but older gentlemen would've read
the magazine. People just wanted to cause trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   Hart certainly hopes ``Sabrina, the Teenage Witch'' won't be in
trouble this fall. After airing on ABC's once mighty ``TGIF''
lineup for four years, the lighthearted comedy moves to the teen
happy WB today.
</P>
<P>
   While the move looks like a magical one for the WB, it may have
been made too late. ``Sabrina's'' ratings have declined steadily,
from 14 million in 1996 to 10 million last year.
</P>
<P>
   The long-time teen idol blames ABC for those sagging numbers.
</P>
<P>
   ``ABC left us in the dust and forgot all about us,'' the Long
Island, N.Y., native says with a trace of bitterness. ``In the
beginning they promoted (the show), then it faded away and with
that, we kind of faded. In order to keep something going, you have
to keep putting it in people's faces, not so they get sick of it or
it gets obnoxious, but, put some billboards up, put some ads on
with Drew Carey. They never did that. On the WB you see posters,
billboards, commercials. I mean, (''Buffy the Vampire Slayer's'')
Sarah Michelle Gellar is in Maybelline ads. They know how to take
care of their stars.''
</P>
<P>
   ABC declined comment.
</P>
<P>
   One fan base hasn't eroded, though _ prison inmates.
</P>
<P>
   ``I get lots and lots and lots of very articulate letters from
them,'' says Beth Broderick, who plays Sabrina's aunt Zelda, ``and
I really try to picture these big prison men watching 'Sabrina.'''
</P>
<P>
   Those burly cons will certainly see a different sitcom this
year. For starters, Sabrina will begin college and get her first
taste of independence.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see the writers are making breast jokes now,'' Hart says,
``but that's not what our audience wants to hear. We just can't
make it racier. That would be stupid.''
</P>
<P>
   Don't expect to see Harvey (Nate Richert), Sabrina's boyfriend.
If you recall, Harvey dumped her after learning she's a witch. The
breakup will be painful. In fact, Sabrina will be in therapy trying
to get over Harvey in the first episode.
</P>
<P>
   Three new characters are also joining the show: Roxie (''Punky
Brewster's'' Soleil Moon Frye), Sabrina's street-smart roommate;
Miles (Trevor Lissauer), a teen Fox Mulder who believes in all
things extraterrestrial; and Morgan (''Clueless''' Elisa Donovan),
a party-all-the-time resident adviser.
</P>
<P>
   And what about Aunts Zelda and Hilda (Caroline Rhea)? They're
still around. Zelda gets a gig as a professor at the university and
Hilda buys the coffeehouse where Sabrina works part time. Luckily,
the always sarcastic Salem the cat (voiced by Nick Bakay) _ the
show's funniest character _ will also be back.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Ferber, the show's executive producer, says the many
changes are welcome.
</P>
<P>
   ``It gives us a new chance to pump some new life and energy into
the show,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Sabrina may be growing up, but the series won't. The breezy
comedy has always been as deep as a kiddie pool. If you expect the
show to tackle more teen-sensitive issues, forget it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've done episodes like Sabrina got addicted to pancakes,
silly stuff like that,'' says Hart, who will direct the show's
100th episode, ``but ``Sabrina ``is really just there for
entertainment purposes. Just sit back, relax, laugh at the end of
your week . . . I don't want to bring issues into it.''
</P>
<P>
   Hart says she only plans to play Sabrina for two more years. The
WB will pick up the series for a guaranteed 44 episodes if it gets
ratings similar to ``Buffy's,'' which should happen easily. Hart
admits at times her bubbly character is difficult to play.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to play sweet and innocent and have people like
you,'' she says. ``It's more challenging to play nice than to play
the b----. But I think I have a good handle on it now.''
</P>
<P>
   Now only time will tell if Hart can keep TV audiences under her
spell. If not, there's always another Maxim cover.

GORE CALLS FOR USE OF OIL RESERVES TO CONTROL FUEL PRICES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GLEN JOHNSON AND ANNE E. KORNBLUT  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND _ The presidential rivals split Thursday over the
wisdom of tapping the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, with Al Gore
proposing a modest withdrawal aimed at reducing oil prices and
George W. Bush casting the move as ``bad public policy'' and ``a
risk to national security.''
</P>
<P>
   Standing at an oil distributorship in St. Mary's County, Md.,
where most people heat their homes with oil, Gore urged the
president to approve a series of ``swaps'' in which oil _ initially
about 5 million barrels per swap _ would be made available to the
market.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, Clinton administration officials have expressed
reluctance to tap the 571 million-barrel reserve, citing concerns
that the move would distort the oil markets and that oil-producing
nations could compensate by cutting production.
</P>
<P>
   But public pressure has increased along with the price of crude
and the prospect of soaring heating bills this winter, and several
officials on Capitol Hill said Gore's statements are a signal that
President Clinton is preparing to tap the reserve, perhaps as early
as Friday.
</P>
<P>
   If the releases lower prices and ease tight supplies, the Energy
Department should make additional releases ``to further stabilize
prices,'' Gore said. A bidder for the oil would return it at a
later date.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need aggressive action right now,'' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president also urged Congress to provide $400 million
in additional energy assistance for low-income families and tax
credits to oil distributors to help build up dwindling heating-oil
stocks. And he said foreign producers must live up to promises to
increase supplies.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's time for OPEC to get serious about the supply and price
of oil,'' the vice president declared.
</P>
<P>
   The price of crude for October delivery is close to $38 a
barrel, the highest in a decade. That has pushed gasoline and home
heating-oil prices past the levels seen during the Persian Gulf
War.
</P>
<P>
   Though 5 million barrels represents just a quarter of one day's
oil consumption in this country, a release would be expected to
ease the pressure on prices by signaling to oil traders that the
government is prepared to step in the market.
</P>
<P>
   After Gore's remarks Thursday, crude oil for November delivery
fell $1.24, or 3.5 percent, to $34 a barrel on the New York
Mercantile Exchange. Nauman Barakat, vice president of global
energy trading at ABN Amro Inc. in New York, estimated that a 5
million-barrel release would probably reduce prices $1 or $2 a
gallon, Bloomberg news service reported.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the wisdom of dipping into the Strategic Petroleum
Reserve has been controversial, even within the administration.
</P>
<P>
   Appearing at an Ohio computer equipment manufacturer, Bush cited
a Sept. 13 warning from the administration's Treasury secretary,
Lawrence Summers, who said he and Federal Reserve Chairman Alan
Greenspan believed a withdrawal ``would be a major and substantial
policy mistake.'' In a memo to Clinton, reported Thursday by the
Wall Street Journal, Summers said tapping the reserve would ``set a
dangerous precedent'' by using it to ``manipulate prices'' rather
than achieve its stated purpose of preventing supply disruptions.
</P>
<P>
   Bush also castigated Gore for making the suggestion after being
quoted last winter as saying OPEC could easily undercut a reserve
withdrawal by reducing crude oil production.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now that we're 47 days away from the election, he's changed
his mind and is ignoring his own advice,'' Bush said. ``That's bad
public policy. The Strategic Petroleum Reserve was an insurance
policy meant for a sudden disruption of our energy supply or for
war. The Strategic Petroleum Reserve should not be used an attempt
to drive down oil prices in an election.
</P>
<P>
   ``It should not be used for short-term political gain at the
cost of long-term national security,'' Bush declared.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the Texas governor favors aggressive exploration for
domestic oil, including in Alaska. He also wants to expand the
country's gasoline-refining capacity, making better use of
hydroelectric power and natural gas, and pressuring the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries to boost production
quotas.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in New York, Bush said on the talk show ``Live with
Regis,'' ``We need to use our strong hand in the diplomatic circles
to make it clear to our friends overseas that we don't want them
holding our nation and our consumers hostage, we expect them to
increase the supply of crude oil, so that the price of crude oil
drops.''
</P>
<P>
   The Strategic Petroleum Reserve was created in 1973 after the
Arab oil embargo to prevent an energy shortage during a war or
global economic crisis. Located mostly in Louisiana and Texas, it
has been tapped only a few times, including during the Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
   A bipartisan coalition of lawmakers on Capitol Hill, led by
Senators Susan Collins, a Maine Republican, and Charles Schumer, a
New York Democrat, and has been urging the administration to tap
the reserve since last winter.
</P>
<P>
   The administration officials has resisted that suggestion, but
now is signaling a willingness to tap the reserve and is expected
to do so by next week, several Senate and House aides and lawmakers
said.
</P>
<P>
   Energy Secretary Bill Richardson on Wednesday met with
Northeastern officials to discuss oil prices, and ``hinted
strongly'' that Clinton would soon approve a crude-oil release, one
Republican aide said. Gore's statements Thursday further confirmed
suspicions that the administration has shifted course, said the
aides, who requested anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a spokeswoman for Summers played down the Sept. 13
memo. There are several options for using the reserve, including
Gore's proposal, ``which could be appropriate in current
circumstances,'' Michelle Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats say the newfound eagerness to tap the reserve is
motivated partly by foreign policy concerns, intended to prevent
the United States from being entirely dependent on foreign crude
oil.
</P>
<P>
   ``Al Gore doesn't want the United States to be held hostage by
Saddam Hussein and other governments in the world,'' said
Representative Edward J. Markey, a Massachusetts Democrat. ``Saddam
boasted two days ago that he would use his oil supply to force the
United States to lift sanctions on Iraq. The Strategic Petroleum
Reserve is our weapon against Saddam and other oil despots.''
</P>
<P>
   Some market analysts also argue that it is false to consider the
oil market a true capitalist model, given the price-setting
practices of OPEC.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people are opposed to touching the reserve because they
view it as intervention in a free market. I don't see it that way,
because the markets are not free,'' said Lincoln F. Anderson, chief
investment officer of LPL Financial Services in Boston. ``It's
obviously not free trade when you have prices being controlled by
an international cartel not operating in our best interests.''
</P>
<P>
   While in Ohio, Bush visited Thermagon, a nearly 100-person
Cleveland manufacturer of computer cooling devices. The governor
spoke about his plan to modernize the Social Security system by
allowing younger workers to voluntarily invest a portion of their
payroll taxes in the stock market.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal was endorsed by Tony Roosevelt, grandson of
President Franklin Delano Roosevelt, considered the driving force
behind Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   ``With courage and candor, he is proposing to modernize and
strengthen the Social Security system and maintain its promise for
future generations of America in a manner that, I think, our 32nd
president would approve,'' Roosevelt said as Bush looked on.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Johnson, traveling with Bush, reported from Ohio; Kornblut reported
from Washington. Wire service material was also used to prepare
this report.

 &HT;    Pep talks during dismal plateaus helped 'The Fat Kid' take
control
 &HT;    By Chris Hutchins
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Blow the cobwebs off your brain and think
back to grade school.
</P>
<P>
   Think back to The Fat Kid.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, no you don't. Don't claim ignorance. You remember The Fat
Kid. The kid who was picked last for kickball, dodge ball, whatever
ball. The kid who got winded on the way to first and _ agonizingly,
inevitably _ tagged out at second. The butt of the jokes. The big
eater. The Fat Kid.
</P>
<P>
   Well, he's all grown up now . . . and he's not so fat anymore.
Meet Joseph ``Joey'' Cristofaro Jr. Almost two years ago, the West
Palm Beach resident got sick of squeezing into his size 46 pants
and catching his breath in stairwells. He was tired of weighing 285
pounds.
</P>
<P>
   So the 21-year-old decided to do something about it.
</P>
<P>
   Since January 1998, he's lost more than 100 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   Before '98, Joey was ``in control'' of so many things in his
life: the studies, the money, the social scene. He was popular.
Voted Most Likely to Succeed in his senior class. Respected by the
customers at the restaurant where he works. But his whole life,
Joey ate a lot and moved very little.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was the area I had no control in. . . '' Joey says. ``It
just seemed more than I could handle. It seemed hopeless. It's like
owning a puppy _ one day you realize it's humongous. You don't
realize it when it's happening, you don't realize it's growing.''
</P>
<P>
   And during his teen years, Joey was growing plenty: About 10
pounds a year. Those 42s quickly became 46es. When Joey realized it
was going to get worse, not better, he took control. He got into a
gym. He got a trainer. He overhauled those Old World Italian eating
habits.
</P>
<P>
   Joey remembers that first workout, too. Actually, that's what
got him _ and kept him _ going.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did the diet, I did the workout. The very next day, (my
trainer) weighed me,'' Joey recalls. ``I'd lost a pound. One pound
in one day. . . . It was the most amazing feeling, because I had
never lost weight. I'd only slowly gained it.''
</P>
<P>
   He lost 60 pounds that first year _ went from 285 to 225. With
his trainer-prescribed balance of cardiovascular workouts, weight
lifting and a high-protein/''controlled'' carbohydrate diet, Joey
was seeing results. He wasn't the only one, either.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone was in shock, because The Fat Kid was losing
weight,'' he says. ``The first place the weight started to go away
was in the face. . . . Everyone would see it, and remark about it.
My family was elated.''
</P>
<P>
   That's swell, but timeout for a reality check. To paraphrase
Joey, the ``Rocky `` theme wasn't playing in the background that
whole year. There were weeks at a time when Joey's weight would
plateau. Despite all the sweat and all the progress, those weeks of
limbo were disheartening and depressing, he says.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's where you have to give yourself a little pep talk and
say, `Nothing worth achieving is going to come easy,' '' Joey
explains. ``If it was so damned easy to lose weight, we'd all be
skinny and have our turn on the cover of a magazine. The plateau,
the discouragement, is a part of it.''
</P>
<P>
   And now, nearly two years later, after an abdominoplasty ``tummy
tuck'' (to remove the sagging skin that resulted from losing all
that weight), Joey is a lean, lanky 180 pounds. His waist size?
Thirty-two. Shirt size? Medium. And get this: For the first time in
eight years, Joey went to the beach. For a former Fat Kid, that's a
big deal.
</P>
<P>
   He's certainly earned it. And if you haven't taken control, Joey
wants you to earn it, too. Here are a few tips he suggests for
folks interested in losing weight:
</P>
<P>
   _ You must exercise! Forget the fad diets, Joey says. Start
eating healthy _ and get moving. ``Do strenuous activity. Don't be
afraid of it,'' he says. ``Of course you're going to get tired, but
if you don't get used to it then, you'll never get used to it in
the future.'' And don't just spend time on the treadmill, Joey
says. Lift weights, too. The new muscle will burn more fat.
</P>
<P>
   _ Results aren't gonna be like the drive-thru. ``You're going to
have to give it time. A lot of time,'' Joey insists. ``You have to
be patient. It seems like a long time to wait, but these two years
have gone by like it's nothing. Losing is a very slow process.''
</P>
<P>
   _ It sounds like a yearbook quote, but it's sound advice: ``If
you're going to work on your physical self, be sure to work on your
mental self, too,'' Joey says. ``If you think you're an
unattractive person when you're heavy, you're going to think the
same way when you're skinny. . . . It took me 19 years to change. I
can't expect a couple years to undo the emotional damage. Other
people shouldn't, either.''
</P>
<P>
   Joey has come a long way in the last two years. He's proud. He
could be _ perhaps should be _ vain. But he isn't.
</P>
<P>
   Because Joey hasn't forgotten what it was like, being that kid
you remember . . . the kid you can't forget. Those experiences have
kept him humble. And that's something he wants others to remember,
when they lose weight.
</P>
<P>
   ``Try not to lose the good qualities about you when you were
heavy,'' he says. ``It was those good qualities that made you
friends. You shouldn't act different because you look different. .
. . Your looks may be what attracts someone to you, but it's your
personality that keeps them there.''

 &HT;    Work slowdown by mechanics cited as AirTran cancels flights
 &HT;    By Nancy Fonti
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Blaming a work slowdown by its mechanics, AirTran
Airways canceled 23 flights Thursday and delayed several others.
</P>
<P>
   AirTran, which is based in Orlando and operates an Atlanta hub,
also scratched two flights on Wednesday and six on Tuesday, said
spokesman Jim Brown. Other flights were delayed on those days, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Most of canceled flights were set to either arrive at or depart
from Hartsfield International Aiport, where the company operates
137 daily departures, second-most behind Delta Air Lines.
</P>
<P>
   Passengers booked on the canceled flights were re-booked on
later flights, Brown said.
</P>
<P>
   The operational problems come as AirTran and its mechanics
union, the Teamsters, prepare to officially start negotiating on
Oct. 1, when the workers' contract becomes amendable.
</P>
<P>
   The two groups have talked informally since the spring, and some
workers are frustrated about the lack of progress.
</P>
<P>
   Local Teamsters officials did not return repeated phone calls
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Airline mechanics inspect aircraft and can recommend delaying or
canceling a flight by citing small flaws unrelated to airworthiness
conditions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have anecdotal evidence of nuisance maintenance
write-ups,'' Brown said. AirTran, he said, is optimistic about the
upcoming talks and hopeful the cancellations will subside.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have made it clear that we want to get it settled,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Brown said the union contacted the company Thursday indicating
it wants to continue negotiations next week.

PERU'S MILITARY BACKS FUJIMORI, EASING FEARS OF COUP 
</HEADLINE>
   By DAVID GONZALEZ    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LIMA, Peru _ Peru's military leaders publicly backed President
Alberto K. Fujimori early Thursday, ending five days of silence
during which there were widespread fears that the armed forces
would move to oust the president.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement released after hours of meetings, the Armed
Forces Joint Command and the National Police said they respected
Fujimori's decision last week to dismantle the National
Intelligence Service and call for new elections, in which he will
not run. The statement also said that despite the opposition's
worries of a coup, there had been no meeting of regional military
leaders with Peru's commanding general.
</P>
<P>
   But the military officials stopped short of criticizing the
National Intelligence Service or its elusive chief, Vladimiro
Montesinos. The statement also avoided any mention of Montesinos, a
close adviser to Fujimori who was seen on videotape last week
apparently bribing an opposition congressman.
</P>
<P>
   Montesinos has not been seen publicly since Fujimori's
announcement on Saturday, prompting allegations that he was still
in command at the Intelligence Service.
</P>
<P>
   ``It falls upon Fujimori to now say what will happen,'' said
Santiago Pedraglio, a political analyst. ``The military said
nothing in the communique about Montesinos because that is up to
the president. They put the ball in his court and he now has to
define himself.''
</P>
<P>
   The United States welcomed the military's show of support for
Fujimori, according to a spokesman for the U.S. Embassy. On
Thursday night, the American ambassador, John Hamilton, visited the
president to express continued support for his recent steps toward
a new election.
</P>
<P>
   The statement eased the fears of many people who had heard
rumors of troop movements and secret meetings. Pedraglio said the
military must have also realized the danger in entertaining such
thoughts, given the international attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``The military, with this external pressure and Fujimori's
calling for elections, did not have the least political reason for
a coup,'' Pedraglio said. ``It would not have survived 24 hours. I
do not think they could have found any important civilian to be at
the head of such a coup.''
</P>
<P>
   The military's decision not to criticize Montesinos was not
unexpected, since he is a former military officer who used his
influence to place some members of his military academy class in
important posts. The military's delay in sending a public signal
reflected these close ties and competing concerns, said Carlos
Tapia, a former lecturer at the Army Intelligence School.
</P>
<P>
   Fujimori, Tapia said, may have wanted to wait to see if any more
incriminating videotapes surfaced, while Montesinos was gauging
support among the military or seeing if he had other options. The
military leaders, Tapia added, may have been concerned about who
could remain in their posts after December, when many are scheduled
to retire.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a confluence of events here that began to fall apart
after eight years,'' Tapia said. ``That is not resolved
overnight.''
</P>
<P>
   One big remaining question is Montesinos' fate. Opposition
groups are demanding that he be arrested as the first step toward
resolving the crisis, and some have conditioned their support for
any election talks with the government on his immediate detention.
</P>
<P>
   Fujimori has insisted that Montesinos is entitled to due process
while an investigation is undertaken. But opposition leaders are
unconvinced, and took little comfort from the military's somewhat
muted pledge of allegiance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I understand their desire is to show support for the
president's decision,'' said Alejandro Toledo, who abandoned his
challenge to Fujimori in this year's presidential election after
accusing the government of fraud. ``I want to wait and see if the
president will issue a decree and fire Montesinos and put him in
jail. Then we will see how the military will behave.''
</P>
<P>
   Toledo has insisted that his party will not take part in any
discussions about new elections until Fujimori acted against
Montesinos.
</P>
<P>
   Opposition legislators have taken a similar line, and they
boycotted a session of Congress Thursday at which lawmakers
discussed investigations into the bribery videotape and the
proposed elections. Some groups have called for a transitional
government or the dissolution of Congress as a condition for new
elections.
</P>
<P>
   Fujimori has insisted that he will remain in power until he
hands over the presidential sash to his successor July 28. In doing
so, he retains a measure of influence and control over the process.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, his supporters in Congress are trying to water
down the case against Montesinos. One lawmaker suggested that any
case against Montesinos would be invalid because the videotape had
been obtained illegally.
</P>
<P>
   Those moves may be a prelude to a trial, at which Montesinos is
either found not guilty or given a suspended sentence.

 &HT;    Georgia-Pacific on track with a multiyear NASCAR sponsorship
 &HT;    By Patti Bond
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Georgia-Pacific has jumped on the billboards-on-wheels
bandwagon, agreeing to sponsor NASCAR driver Buckshot Jones in the
Winston Cup series next year.
</P>
<P>
   The deal gives Georgia-Pacific a high-profile way to get
products such as Angel Soft tissue and Sparkle paper towels in
front of a huge audience. Jones, who grew up in Tucker, will start
racing the Georgia-Pacific Dodge in February at Daytona. He'll
drive for Richard Petty's racing team.
</P>
<P>
   ``This sponsorship enables us to focus and unite all of our
brands under one umbrella,'' said Clint Kennedy, executive vice
president of the Atlanta-based forest products company. Kennedy,
flanked by Richard Petty and his son, Kyle, at a Thursday press
conference, said the NASCAR sponsorship fits with a new consumer
marketing push to build brand awareness of Georgia-Pacific
products.
</P>
<P>
   The company recently launched a national TV ad campaign, touting
low-profile products such as lumber, office paper and boxes. It's
also in the process of getting rid of pulp mills and commodity
businesses and merging with Fort James to become the world's
largest maker of toilet paper and paper towels.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia-Pacific would not disclose how much it's paying for the
multiyear NASCAR deal, but it comes at a time when sponsorship
rates are soaring. Recently the maker of Viagra set a new
benchmark. Pfizer reportedly paid about $14 million a season to
sponsor driver Mark Martin. That was in the neighborhood of
DuPont's recent deal with Jeff Gordon.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've seen prices go up and up and up. Deals now are at the
$15 million dollar mark, up significantly from last year, when they
went anywhere from $10 million to $12 million a year,'' said
William Chipps, senior editor of IEG Sponsorship Report, a
publication that tracks sports marketing.
</P>
<P>
   Chipps noted that Georgia-Pacific's NASCAR tab is likely on the
lower end of that scale because Jones is an up-and-coming driver.
</P>
<P>
   NASCAR is the fastest-growing spectator sport. More than 11
million people attended NASCAR events last year, and 252 million
watched televised races.
</P>
<P>
   Several Atlanta-based companies have latched onto NASCAR,
including Coca-Cola, BellSouth and Home Depot. United Parcel
Service is expected to become the next major sponsor of a car.

IN THE NEW SEASON, THE NETWORKS FALL SHORT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, Sept. 24)  
 (Eds: With sidebar, TV-FALL-CAPSULES-SFCHRON)  
 By JOHN CARMAN  
 c.2000, San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ABC has ``Who Wants to Be a Millionaire,'' but CBS has the
goods.
</P>
<P>
   Or what passes for the goods this year.
</P>
<P>
   In a delayed and widely disparaged television season, CBS seems
best positioned to claim the somewhat meaningless title of
top-rated network.
</P>
<P>
   The season begins in earnest on Oct. 2, a few days after the
last men's marathon runner has crossed the Olympic finish line in
Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   Optimism at CBS is based on television's glossiest batch of
pilots and tweaked by the lingering residue of the summer smash,
``Survivor.'' That show will return with fresh competitors in
midseason, on the heels of another CBS ratings booster, the Super
Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   But it's the new series that should determine whether CBS
displaces last season's ratings champion, ABC. Based on the pilot
episodes, CBS is launching one stinker, one so-so police drama and
five qualitatively promising new series.
</P>
<P>
   The stinker is the domestic sitcom ``Yes, Dear,'' hammocked
between ``The King of Queens'' and ``Everybody Loves Raymond'' on
Mondays.
</P>
<P>
   The so-so drama is ``C.S.I.,'' a Friday night series about
police forensics experts peering into microscopes to solve crimes
in Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   The better group is led by the season's highest-profile new
show, ``Bette,'' at 8 p.m. Wednesdays. The comedy is Bette Midler's
first TV series.
</P>
<P>
   Right behind ``Bette'' on Wednesdays is ``Welcome to New York,''
from David Letterman's production company. Jim Gaffigan plays a
Midwestern weathercaster who takes a TV job in New York, but most
of the laughs come from the comically gifted Christine Baranski, as
his producer.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Fugitive'' is a slick remake on Fridays, this time with
Tim Daly as the innocent escapee on the run from the law.
</P>
<P>
   The other networks have virtually abandoned series programming
on Saturday nights, which could grease the skids for CBS' ``That's
Life'' and ``The District.'' The first combines comedy and drama in
the exploits of a late-blooming New Jersey bartender (Heather Paige
Kent) who enrolls in college, and the latter showcases Craig T.
Nelson as a reform-minded police chief in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   It's a good _ sorry, not great _ crop in an off-year for TV.
</P>
<P>
   CBS' business problem is that none of these shows is calibrated
for younger viewers, the key demographic group that suddenly
discovered CBS with ``Survivor.'' That's why the household ratings
title is only partially meaningful. It's good for bragging rights,
but most advertisers buy TV time on the basis of demographics, not
overall ratings.
</P>
<P>
   Even with CBS' impressive development efforts, there's little
critical enthusiasm for this fall season. The main reason is the
absence of any show that's attracting unbridled raves. Critical
favorites such as ``Murder One,'' ``EZ Streets'' and ``Action''
have fared poorly in recent years, but at least their presence
suggested a creative pulse at the networks.
</P>
<P>
   Another reason is the play-it-safe tenor of the programming. The
two big shows of the past year were ``Who Wants to Be a
Millionaire'' and ``Survivor,'' both departures from the sitcom and
scripted-drama norm.
</P>
<P>
   Their success pointed to a public weariness with sitcom and
drama conventions. So what about the fall? All the new series are
sitcoms and dramas, with the lone exception of a sketch comedy
show, ``Hype,'' on the WB network.
</P>
<P>
   Bizarre reality projects, spawned by the ``Survivor''
phenomenon, are in the works and will make it onto the air in a few
months. But ``Millionaire'' should have been hint enough; viewers
are tired of the ordinariness of the ordinary.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of ``Who Wants to Be a Millionaire,'' ABC's solution to
the 2000-01 season is one more night of Regis Philbin, and little
else. Last season's flash hit is now on four nights a week _
Sundays, Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Thursdays. That accounts for
nearly 20 percent of the ABC prime-time schedule.
</P>
<P>
   Surprisingly, though, ``Millionaire'' won't be a lead-in for any
of ABC's four new series _ an odd failure to exploit a franchise
hit. But then, this is the network that thought it would be a
capital idea to promote its programming with talking signs at
public urinals.
</P>
<P>
   An aroma of decay surrounds NBC. Established hits (``ER,''
``Friends,'' ``Frasier'') are aging, there are widening cracks in
the Thursday lineup, and the Peacock's new shows invite little
excitement.
</P>
<P>
   NBC does have cause for pride as the most-honored network at the
Emmy awards earlier this month. Its Emmy-winning drama, ``The West
Wing,'' and Emmy-winning comedy, ``Will &AMP; Grace,'' are still in
their youths.
</P>
<P>
   NBC is taking risks. With less than a full season on the air,
``Daddio'' will lead off the Monday night schedule. Without so much
as a usable pilot, ``The Michael Richards Show'' is the Tuesday
linchpin. Another new show, the Aaron Spelling nighttime soap
``Titans,'' leads off on Wednesdays. ``Frasier'' has been ejected
from Thursdays and moved to Tuesdays.
</P>
<P>
   The best new show on NBC is ``Ed,'' an amiable comedy-drama in
the style of ``Northern Exposure.'' But ``Ed'' doesn't seem a
comfortable fit for its 8 p.m. Sunday time slot.
</P>
<P>
   If NBC is creaky, Fox is a mess. For each of the past four
years, Fox has had to renege on part of its fall schedule; this
year, it's ridiculous.
</P>
<P>
   A planned Robert Schimmel sitcom has been pulled because of
Schimmel's health problems. No one's fault. But the two announced
Thursday shows, ``Lone Gunmen'' and an unspecified Michael Crichton
project, are less excusably absent. There's not even a script yet
for the Crichton show. And ``Night Visions,'' a ``Twilight
Zone''-type anthology series for Fridays, also has been yanked from
the schedule.
</P>
<P>
   These Fox headaches follow a disappointing 1999-2000 season
during which chief programmer Doug Herzog was ousted.
</P>
<P>
   Fox's hopes ride on ``Boston Public,'' a David E. Kelley drama
for Mondays; ``The $treet,'' a Darren Star drama about
libido-driven Wall Street stockbrokers, on Wednesdays; and ``Dark
Angel,'' a futuristic adventure series from James Cameron
(``Titanic''), on Tuesdays.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dark Angel'' is a star-making vehicle for its young star,
Jessica Alba, who is regarded as the actress with the season's best
breakout potential. And no, the term doesn't apply to her
complexion.
</P>
<P>
   (In a coincidental feat of network scheduling, ``Dark Angel''
will compete directly with the WB's ``Angel.'')
</P>
<P>
   The WB was another sick puppy after last season, though it
attributed most of its ratings erosion to the loss of program
carriage on the WGN cable superstation.
</P>
<P>
   Still, ``Felicity'' and ``Dawson's Creek'' fell adrift,
``Roswell'' barely survived and ``Popular'' was barely popular.
``Jack &AMP; Jill'' is returning in a shared-time-period arrangement
with ``Felicity,'' similar to the ``Once and Again'' and ``NYPD
Blue'' situation on ABC.
</P>
<P>
   The best WB newcomer is an involving, family-friendly drama
called ``The Gilmore Girls,'' at 8 p.m. Thursdays.
</P>
<P>
   UPN posted gains with ``WWF Smackdown!'' and a general
conversion to male teen programs, plans to continue its hormonally
enriched programming this fall, and is due to change its name to
the Paramount Network in January.
</P>
<P>
   That is, if it lives to see January. Fox's parent company, News
Corp., is buying the local station group that had been the core of
UPN's distribution, and the future of the so-called ``weblet'' is
uncertain.
</P>
<P>
   UPN's murky situation, strangely enough, is an apt picture of
network television in 2000. Ownerships and alliances are far more
tangled than in the past, the future is unclear, schedules seem to
be works in progress, and one elusive hit is capable of reversing a
network's fortunes.
</P>
<P>
   We know one thing. If the wrestling-enhanced UPN is somehow
scrapped before next fall, it'll be the first time a network died
with a grunt.

THE NEW FALL SHOWS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, Sept. 24)

 By JOHN CARMAN  
 c.2000, San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR;   &UR; BETTE &LR;  (8 p.m. Wednesdays, CBS): In her first TV series, diva
Bette Midler plays a cartoonish version of herself. She's supported
by Kevin Dunn as her indulgent husband, Marina Malota as their
13-year-old daughter and Joanna Gleason as Midler's best friend and
manager. Midler overwhelms the screen at first, until the dust
settles and everyone _ not least the viewer _ gets comfortable with
the idea of a Midler sitcom. There might not be anyone else on the
planet who could say, ``C'mon everybody, grub's on'' and make it
sound ironic and funny. The time-period competition includes ``Who
Wants to Be a Millionaire.'' (4 stars out of 5)
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BOSTON PUBLIC &LR;  (8 p.m. Mondays, Fox): Producer David E. Kelley
(``Ally McBeal,'' ``The Practice'') employs his usual big ensemble
cast to explore the lives of high school teachers and
administrators. The most familiar name in the cast is Fyvish
Finkel, who won an Emmy in Kelley's ``Picket Fences.'' If there's
cause for concern, it's that Kelley fares worst when he strays from
the legal genre. (Too late for review)
</P>
<P>
   &UR; C.S.I. &LR;  (9 p.m. Fridays, CBS): William Petersen and Marg
Helgenberger head the cast as police forensic investigators in Las
Vegas, probing microscopic clues to solve crimes. At least it's a
new twist on police dramas. Capable cast, too. But there may be a
reason this show hasn't been done before. In a word: boring. (2
stars)
</P>
<P>
   &UR; CURSED &LR;  (8:30 p.m. Thursdays, NBC): Steven Weber (``Wings'') is
a Chicago adman whose life goes haywire after a blind date hits him
with a mysterious curse. Amy Pietz (``Caroline in the City'') is an
ex-girlfriend, and Chris Elliott (``There's Something About Mary'')
is Weber's eccentric best friend. Further evidence that the former
``best night of television on television'' is losing its panache.
``Cursed'' tries all too conspicuously to ape the quirky urbanity
of ``Seinfeld,'' without the wit. Bring on ``Chains of Love.'' (2
stars)
</P>
<P>
   &UR; DAG &LR;  (9:30 p.m. Tuesdays, NBC): The White House comedy stars
David Alan Grier (``In Living Color'') as an unlucky Secret Service
agent assigned to protect the self-absorbed first lady (Delta
Burke). It'll be nip-and-tuck to see who has to vacate the White
House first _ this witless comedy or the Clintons. (2 stars)
</P>
<P>
   &UR; DARK ANGEL &LR;  (9 p.m. Tuesdays, Fox): Newcomer Jessica Alba is
Max, a ``genetically enhanced'' young beauty who has escaped from
her military handlers and works as a bike messenger in a rundown,
futuristic Seattle. The government is still in pursuit. The premise
is shopworn. But Alba is star material, and the series is created
and produced by the meticulous producer-director of ``Titanic,''
James Cameron. Wait and see if it finds a groove. (3 stars)
</P>
<P>
   &UR; DEADLINE &LR;  (9 p.m. Mondays, NBC): Producer Dick Wolf (``Law &AMP;
Order'') moves from the courthouse to the newsroom in a newspaper
drama starring character actor Oliver Platt (``Bulworth'') as a
muckraking columnist in New York. (Too late for review)
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE DISTRICT &LR;  (10 p.m. Saturdays, CBS): Inspired by former New
York City Deputy Police Commissioner Jack Maple, it stars Craig T.
Nelson (``Coach'') as an idealistic new police chief in Washington,
D.C. His nemeses are rampant crime and an entrenched bureaucracy.
Sounds like a yawner, and it won't get much attention deep in the
Saturday TV ghetto. But sharp writing and a crisp performance from
Nelson add up to a surprisingly invigorating show, with some
unexpected humor. (3 stars)
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ED &LR;  (8 p.m. Sundays, NBC): The one-hour comedy from David
Letterman's production company stars Tom Cavanagh as a New York
lawyer who returns to his Ohio hometown, buys a bowling alley and
sets up his legal practice there. Free legal advice if you bowl
three games. The season's best pilot captures much of the joyful
insouciance of ``Northern Exposure.'' But ``Ed'' is an awkward fit
for its time period. Too bad NBC didn't roll the dice and risk it
at 9 p.m. Thursdays. (4 stars)
</P>
<P>
   &UR; FREAKYLINKS &LR;  (9 p.m. Fridays, Fox): Talk about freaky links;
this show joins the producers of ``The Blair Witch Project'' and
``Quantum Leap.'' It's a sci-fi drama about a maverick Web master
(Ethan Embry) who specializes in debunking supernatural mysteries,
until his dead twin brother shows up on his computer screen. It has
its unsettling moments. It has its sags, too. If only the
creepiness could be more effectively sustained. (3 stars)
</P>
<P>
   &UR; FREEDOM &LR;  (8 p.m. Fridays, UPN): Joel Silver (``The Matrix''),
Don Cracchiolo (``Romeo Must Die'') and Hans Tobeason (``The
Visitor'') collaborate to produce an action drama about resistance
fighters after a military takeover of the United States. Lots of
martial-arts kicks and spins are expected. (Too late for review)
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE FUGITIVE &LR;  (8 p.m. Fridays, CBS): Tim Daly (``Wings'') is
Dr. Richard Kimble and Mykelti Williamson is the pursuing Lt.
Philip Gerard in the latest remake of the 1960s hit that starred
David Janssen. Yes, we know how it turns out. That's not such a
liability; ``The Fugitive'' was always an anthology show in thick
disguise. The real interest is in the stories along the way, and
those are new. The pilot episode is slick and obviously costly. Did
they blow the budget? The plan is to shoot the series on the fly,
moving around the nation. (3 stars)
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE GEENA DAVIS SHOW &LR;  (9:30 p.m. Tuesdays, ABC): Looking to TV
for career resuscitation, Geena Davis plays a chirpy New York
career woman who marries a single dad (Peter Horton of
``thirtysomething'') and must adjust her life abruptly as the
stepmother of two children (Makenzie Vega and John Daley). A
loathsome domestic sitcom, until Davis bursts into cute hyperdrive.
Then it becomes a matter of taste; Davis may have more talent than
restraint. Daley, who plays the teenage son, was the kid from the
ill-fated ``Freaks and Geeks'' last season. He's tougher to take
here. (3 stars)
</P>
<P>
   &UR; GIDEON'S CROSSING &LR;  (10 p.m. Wednesdays, ABC): Andre Braugher
(``Homicide'') is Dr. Ben Gideon, a tough Boston physician _ and
recent widower _ whose expertise in experimental medicine often
makes him the last best hope for critically ill patients. Ruben
Blades plays his best friend, the hospital's chief executive.
Braugher exerts his usual ramrod command of the TV screen. The
story lines might be dark, but the writing is solid, and you're
left with the feeling that you've actually experienced something.
(3 stars)
</P>
<P>
   &UR; GILMORE GIRLS &LR;  (8 p.m. Thursdays, WB): The generational drama
stars Lauren Graham (``NewsRadio'') as the unmarried manager of a
picturesque inn nestled in a small Connecticut town and newcomer
Alexis Bledel as her 16-year-old daughter. Kelly Bishop and Edward
Herrmann are cast as Graham's coldly patrician parents. It's a
quietly decent show that, to its credit, doesn't sit up and bark
for your attention. Graham and Bledel have a wonderful rapport
onscreen; their characters seem as much sisters as mother and
daughter. (4 stars)
</P>
<P>
   &UR; GIRLFRIENDS &LR;  (9:30 p.m. Mondays, UPN): Joan (Tracee Ellis
Ross), Maya (Golden Brooks), Toni (Jill Marie Jones) and Lynn
(Persia White) are upwardly mobile friends who share each other's
secrets and, sometimes, each other's boyfriends. A black ``Sex and
the City,'' and more tasteful than its HBO model. What it isn't is
funny. It's from Kelsey Grammer's production company. (2 stars)
</P>
<P>
   &UR; GROSSE POINTE &LR;  (8:30 p.m. Fridays, WB): Producer Darren Star
tries to satirize TV, with modest success. It's about life behind
the scenes of a prime-time soap opera. The youthful cast includes
Irene Molloy, Bonnie Somerville, Kyle Howard, Al Santos, Lindsay
Sloane and Kohl Sudduth. The pilot was a thinly disguised spoof of
Star's own ``Beverly Hills 90210,'' including a scathing send-up of
Tori Spelling. That brought a protest from her powerful father,
Aaron Spelling. Star backed down and diluted the humor, depriving
the stew of its tastiest ingredient. Anyway, the show isn't as
smart as last year's TV satire, ``Action.'' (3 stars)
</P>
<P>
   &UR; HYPE &LR;  (9 p.m. Sundays, WB): This half-hour sketch comedy series
is as far as the fall season veers from safe formats. Featuring a
young 10-member cast of sketch players, ``Hype'' promises to be
fast-paced and current. It will all depend on the writing. (Too
late for review)
</P>
<P>
   &UR; LEVEL 9 &LR;  (9 p.m. Fridays, UPN): Yet another top-secret federal
law enforcement agency is invented for TV. This one tackles
computer crime, including the Internet disclosure of the names and
addresses of government-protected witnesses. Kate Hodges plays the
team leader. Executive producer John Sacret Young (``China Beach'')
makes the most of mediocre material. The episode sent for preview
climaxed with a deftly filmed high-rise action sequence. But
whenever the action stops, the show is a tin man without an oil
can. (3 stars)
</P>
<P>
   &UR; MADIGAN MEN &LR;  (9:30 p.m. Fridays, ABC): Gabriel Byrne (``The
Usual Suspects'') turns to TV comedy as a New York architect and
single dad. John C. Hensley plays his teenage son, and Roy Dotrice
is Byrne's father, newly arrived from Ireland. Grant Shaud
(``Murphy Brown'') is Byrne's business partner. Three seasons ago,
``The Gregory Hines Show'' was better at executing a nearly
identical premise on CBS but made no ratings headway. This
Irish-flavored version isn't horrible, though Byrne appears ill at
ease in a sitcom. Little chance. (3 stars)
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE MICHAEL RICHARDS SHOW &LR;  (8 p.m. Tuesdays, NBC): The
erstwhile Kramer puts his three Emmys on the line in the role of a
bumbling private eye. The supporting cast includes Tim Meadows
(``Saturday Night Live'') and William Devane. A scrapped pilot and
other delays point to a troubled project, but Richards has an
undeniable knack for physical comedy. (Too late for review)
</P>
<P>
   &UR; NIKKI &LR;  (9:30 p.m. Sundays, WB): Spectacularly constructed Nikki
Cox (``Unhappily Ever After,'' ``Norm'') finally gets her own star
vehicle, albeit at the tail end of the WB's Sunday schedule. She
plays a Las Vegas showgirl. Newcomer Nick von Esmarch is her
husband, a rookie pro wrestler. Christine Estabrook plays von
Esmarch's abrasive mother. Ambitious enough to include occasional
musical numbers, in a tacky Vegas style, the blue-collar comedy is
mildly agreeable in spite of its mediocre writing and uneven
performances. It doesn't hurt that for adolescent boys, Cox is the
stuff that dreams are made of. (3 stars)
</P>
<P>
   &UR; NORMAL, OHIO &LR;  (8:30 p.m. Wednesdays, Fox): John Goodman, gay
dad. The comedy has been through title changes, reconstructive
surgery and rehab. First it was to feature Anthony LaPaglia with
Goodman and be set in Los Angeles. Now LaPaglia is gone, and
Goodman's character will return to his Ohio hometown with his
teenage son (Greg Pitts). Goodman would have been cast as TV's
first openly gay male lead, but Richard Hatch turned up on
``Survivor.'' (Too late for review)
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE $TREET &LR;  (9 p.m. Wednesdays, Fox): As visualized by Darren
Star, a producer who makes his mentor, Aaron Spelling, look like a
philosopher king, Wall Street is awash in sex, money and power.
Mostly sex. The ensemble cast, playing young stockbrokers, is
uniformly attractive and not noticeably Ivy Leagueish. This is the
sort of new series that hit the airwaves in profusion a year ago,
only to fizzle. Rick Hoffman, as a caddish broker named Freddie
Sacker, wins best-of-cast honors. It might find a niche among young
adults. (2 stars)
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THAT'S LIFE &LR;  (8 p.m. Saturdays, CBS): Heather Paige Kent
(``Jenny,'' ``Stark Raving Mad'') is Lydia DeLucca, a glib New
Jersey bartender who calls off her engagement to pursue a lifelong
dream _ a college education. Debi Mazar is one of her blue-collar
friends; Ellen Burstyn and Paul Sorvino play Kent's parents. A
promising comedy-drama that
</P>
<P>
   seems victimized by its Saturday-night time slot. Twenty-five
years ago, before home video, Saturday was TV's best night. Now the
ratings are so perilously low that this fall, only CBS is bothering
to program Saturdays with conventional series. ``That's Life''
deserves a fairer shot. (4 stars)
</P>
<P>
   &UR; TITANS &LR;  (8 p.m. Wednesdays, NBC): The protagonist in the
ensemble cast seems to be Casper Van Dien (``Starship Troopers'')
as a hunky Navy pilot whose ex-flame (the vixenish Yasmine Bleeth)
marries his millionaire father (Perry King), a Beverly Hills
industrial magnate. Victoria Principal plays King's former wife.
King is due to depart the series early in the season. He may feel
relieved. It's an Aaron Spelling production, almost prototypically
so. Spelling and NBC figured that with ``Melrose Place'' gone,
viewers were ripe for an over-the-top prime-time sudser. ``Titans''
is, of course, a dramatic atrocity. The acting is bad enough to
crack teeth. The network is promoting it as a guilty pleasure. (2
stars)
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE TROUBLE WITH NORMAL &LR;  (8:30 p.m. Fridays, ABC): Two paranoid
buddies (David Krumholtz, Brad Raider) are sure that the guys in
the next apartment (Jon Cryer, Larry Joe Campbell) are spying on
them. And they are. Paget Brewster tops off the comedy cast as a
psychologist who rides herd on the strange quartet. Any ABC
programmer who thought this show could be a hit really should have
his head examined. (2 stars)
</P>
<P>
   &UR; TUCKER &LR;  (8:30 p.m. Mondays, NBC): This comedy stars Bay Area
child actor Eli Marienthal as a 14-year-old who moves in, along
with his newly divorced mother (Noelle Beck), with his acid-tongued
aunt (Katey Sagal). Without ``Malcolm in the Middle,'' there surely
wouldn't be a ``Tucker.'' Once you get past the knockoff factor,
though, you'll find a nicely produced little comedy with assets of
its own. One of them is the delectably witchy Sagal (``Married ...
With Children''). (3 stars)
</P>
<P>
   &UR; WELCOME TO NEW YORK &LR;  (8:30 p.m. Wednesdays, CBS): Actor and
stand-up comic Jim Gaffigan is a weathercaster _ named Jim Gaffigan
_ called up from the Indiana bush leagues to be the on-air weather
guy on a New York morning news show. Christine Baranski
(``Cybill'') co-stars as his jaded boss, the show's executive
producer. Let's see, Indiana weathercaster moves up to the big
tent. The production company is none other than David Letterman's
Worldwide Pants. Baranski easily steals the show, which is a
decently bright comedy dependent on the fortunes of its
high-profile lead-in, ``Bette.'' (3 stars)
</P>
<P>
   &UR; YES, DEAR &LR;  (8:30 p.m. Mondays, CBS): A domestic sitcom about
couples and parenting. One couple (Anthony Clark, Jean Louisa
Kelly) tries to raise their year-old son by the book. Their
relatives (Mike O'Malley, Liza Snyder) are more comedically
laissez-faire about life and parenthood. It's the show for viewers
who find hilarity in a child spitting up strained peas. For anyone
else, it's the worst new show of the fall. (1 star)

 &HT;    Frampton chats about groupies, fashion
 &HT;    By Hap Erstein
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Rocker Peter Frampton, 50, was an early
interview subject of Rolling Stone journalist Cameron Crowe, who
wrote the liner notes for Frampton's classic album, ``Frampton
Comes Alive!'' Frampton returned the favor by acting as a technical
consultant on Crowe's '70s rock movie, ``Almost Famous.'' In
addition to teaching actors how to play rock stars, he did a cameo
as a roadie for his former group Humble Pie. He had so much fun, he
even put up with our questions this week.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What drives you crazy about the way rock stars are depicted
in movies?
</P>
<P>
   A: Playing the wrong guitar from the wrong era or singing in a
microphone that was made yesterday when it's supposed to be 1957.
Generally it's equipment, guitars, anything to do with the
technical side of it that's too new for the period, because they
don't do their homework.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What went wrong with the movie of ``Sgt. Pepper's Lonely
Hearts Club Band?''
</P>
<P>
   A: I think the people that were involved in it thought that star
power could drive anything. But content is always what makes a
movie, and there was no content there. There was no script to talk
of. There's so much wrong with that movie, it's hard to know where
to start with it. Let me tell you, I can now say I've worked on the
worst and I've worked on the best. (Laughter)
</P>
<P>
   Q: What was Pete's Rock and Roll School for ``Almost Famous''
like?
</P>
<P>
   A: With Billy (Crudup, who plays lead guitarist Russell Hammond)
it was the whole nine yards. He'd never played guitar before. He
would videotape my fingers on the fret board. He wanted to feel
that he had the solos absolutely down, note for note, so he could
close his eyes. He said, ``What will make me look like I know what
I'm doing?'' I said, ``When you close your eyes and look upwards,
and your fingers are moving all on their own.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: What was the best thing about groupies?
</P>
<P>
   A: Well, you would look forward to various cities, because there
would be certain ones. In those days, it's true, you didn't
necessarily sleep with them all, it wasn't that kind of thing.
Well, all right, a couple. But it was the friendship and the fact
that they were huge fans at that time.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What rock song do you wish you had written?
</P>
<P>
   A: Oh, there are so many. All right, ``All Right Now.'' There's
a classic. Because for the time, it was such an unconventional way
to write a song. It's just basically guitar, drums and voice, until
the chorus comes in. When the bass kicks in, which is just for the
choruses and the solos, apart from being a great sing-along song,
the structure of it was very, very different.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Is there anything you miss about '70s fashions?
</P>
<P>
   A: Absolutely not. (Laughter) All right, a couple of leather
jackets. But apart from that, you can keep your satin and all those
horrible things I used to wear. The music from the '70s is
wonderful, brilliant. The costuming is diabolical.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Is there such a thing as being too old to be a rock star?
</P>
<P>
   A: Well, there's that wonderful line in (''Almost Famous'')
where the new manager says, ``You've got to grab it while the
iron's hot. If you think Mick Jagger's going to be 50 and still
dancing around the stage, you're sadly mistaken.'' So, I mean,
we're just pushing the envelope, aren't we?

 &HT;    'Woman' a feast of food, love, female empowerment
 &HT;    By Hap Erstein
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PALM BEACH, Fla. _ They say that casting is responsible for half
of a film's success. That is certainly the case with Woman on Top,
an intoxicating little fable of love, food and female empowerment
starring the delicious Spanish beauty Penelope Cruz (''All About My
Mother'').
</P>
<P>
   That is not to negate the playful screenplay by Vera Blasi or
the magic realism-tinged direction of Fina Torres. But it is the
star quality of Cruz that carries the movie. Crucial to the tale is
believing that legions of men would take one look at her, drop
everything and follow her down the street and into a cooking class.
</P>
<P>
   With Cruz, there is no question about it.
</P>
<P>
   Blasi's script unnecessarily loads Brazilian spitfire Isabella
(Cruz) with quirks. She is a control freak who must lead when she
dances, is prone to motion sickness when she is not driving and
insists on the sexual position of the movie's title. This last
requirement is what causes a rift with her macho Latin husband
Toninho, who had kept her toiling out of sight in the kitchen of
his popular Bahia restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   Once Isabella catches him sampling another woman's wares, she
packs and heads for the culinary greener hills of San Francisco.
Such is her magnetism, and her cooking skill, that she parlays a
part-time job as an adult-education cooking instructor into her own
television show. ``Passion Food Live'' becomes a big hit, but
Isabella finds she has to contend with a lovestruck producer,
meddling network execs and even Toninho, who arrives with a band of
troubadours and worms his way onto the show.
</P>
<P>
   The film is full of amusing and, occasionally, puzzling touches.
On the positive side is Isabella's flamboyant friend Monica (Harold
Perrineau Jr.), with whom she moves in. No explanation is given or
needed about why he is an out-there transvestite, but Perrineau
adds a spirited level of entertaining bemusement.
</P>
<P>
   Further magical moments come from Isabella's adherence to the
sea goddess Yemanja, whose powers apparently affect the ways of
love. ``Woman on Top'' is such a fable that one should not demand
too much logic of it, but the TV studio scenes and their technical
screw-ups seem particularly improbable.
</P>
<P>
   Helping us to not take the story too seriously are director of
photography Thierry Arbogast's candy-colored visuals and the
good-time bossa nova melodies that waft around the aromas of
Isabella's cooking.
</P>
<P>
   This marks Cruz's first starring role in an English-language
film, with ``All the Pretty Horses'' on deck for later this year,
and her halting speech patterns only add to her charms. It remains
to be seen what kind of roles Hollywood relegates her to, but she
commands the screen here in what is admittedly not a character
requiring much range. Perrineau, who also handled a bit of drag in
Baz Luhrmann's ``Romeo + Juliet,'' lends merry support, and
Brazil's Murilo Benicio (Toninho) is an attractive, insensitive
hunk who naturally must change his ways.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, ``Woman on Top'' is a pleasant, but light meal, even
as Cruz is a feast for the eyes.
</P>
<P>
   WOMAN ON TOP
</P>
<P>
   3 stars
</P>
<P>
   Rated R: Brief nudity, gastronomic eroticism, language
</P>
<P>
   Running time: 1 hour, 33 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: Intoxicating fable of love and food.

 &HT;    Torres' third film explores the link between cuisine, sex
 &HT;    By Hap Erstein
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Venezuelan-born director Fina Torres is
fighting a flu, but she is eager to learn the American ways of
filmmaking, which unfortunately include flying around the country
publicizing her movie.
</P>
<P>
   ``Woman on Top,'' her third feature film _ but the first made
for a United States studio _ follows a determined, talented and
sultry chef named Isabella (Penelope Cruz), who leaves her husband
and his restaurant to travel to San Francisco. There, she lands a
dream job, hosting a cooking show on television.
</P>
<P>
   Torres also found that she had to leave home to pursue her goal
of making movies.
</P>
<P>
   ``So I went to Paris, because I thought that France was the best
movie school in the world,'' she explains. Her background as a
photojournalist landed Torres a spot in the Institute des Hautes
Etudes Cinematographiques, then support positions as a film editor,
camera operator and script supervisor in France. ``Little by
little, you stay, you know, because you start to work, and you
start to make your life.''
</P>
<P>
   It has not been easy for Torres to become the woman on top in
her profession, to gain jobs as a film director, but she refuses to
blame her gender. ``I think it's very difficult to become a
director for everybody _ man and woman. You have to really, really
work a lot and sacrifice a lot. You know, like family life, like
your time, like everything.''
</P>
<P>
   Her first feature, 1985's ``Oriana,'' was an award-winner at the
Cannes Film Festival, but it took eight more years before she could
make another, the admired French-Venezuelan-Spanish-Belgian
co-production, ``Celestial Clockwork.'' Both of them, like ``Woman
on Top,'' feature strong female characters who have much in common
with their director.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, but this character of Isabella, I could not say it is
autobiographical,'' Torres quickly adds. ``But I think she is a
very close person to me. This is a character I know very well.''
Asked about her skill in the kitchen, she replies shrewdly: ``I
love to cook, but I'm not as good a cook as a writer of the script.
I think to cook is very near moviemaking, you know? You don't have
to resign yourself to old recipes. You have to always perform,
invent, go further.''
</P>
<P>
   And, as the movie makes abundantly clear, there is a close
relationship between cooking and sex. ``I did not just invent this
idea; I think it's as old as humanity,'' says Torres. ``I think
it's just a problem of biological and physiological needs. Even
animals are like that. First, they have the need to be fed, to
survive. When that's over, then they can think about something
else, and that is to reproduce themselves.'' Torres readily agrees
that the best decision she made on the movie was casting Cruz. Yet
it took some convincing of the Fox Searchlight executives.
``Penelope was not famous at that moment, at all. They did not know
her in the United States,'' says Torres. Fox wanted such
more-established actresses as Salma Hayek or Jennifer Lopez, but
Torres remained adamant.
</P>
<P>
   Since she was signed to make ``Woman on Top,'' Cruz was featured
in Pedro Almodovar's Oscar-winning ``All About My Mother'' and cast
in ``All the Pretty Horses,'' due for release later this year. It
is unlikely to be as eye-catching a showcase for her as ``Woman on
Top.'' As Torres told the suits, ``I think the only person in the
world who could do Isabella the right way and take this movie to a
higher level is Penelope Cruz.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, audiences at film festivals from Cannes to Montreal to
Los Angeles have agreed, and Torres' stock has also risen. She is
weighing her options now, having almost jumped into making another
movie too quickly. ``I started working on it, but I saw that I was
so tired that I decided to stop and just take a break,'' she says,
with a flu rasp in her voice. ``Making a movie is really a tough
enterprise, but I intend to make that my life.''

   SEATTLE _ Just as Henry Jackson was once known as the ``senator
from Boeing,'' Washington state's Slade Gorton is delighted to call
himself the ``senator from Microsoft,'' a man whose pit-bull
advocacy for the software giant in the nation's capital has earned
him the corporation's gratitude and campaign contributions from
Bill Gates and other company officials.
</P>
<P>
   But as he runs for re-election to a fourth Senate term this
fall, Gorton finds himself in a fierce race against a Democratic
opponent, more than 30 years his junior, who has an even more
direct tie to another large software company in the Northwest.
</P>
<P>
   She is Maria Cantwell, an executive at RealNetworks in Seattle,
the company that pioneered audio and visual technology on the
Internet and that in just a few years helped her accumulate a
fortune that her campaign estimates at $40 million. Cantwell, a
41-year-old former congresswoman, vows to spend ``whatever it
takes'' to unseat Gorton.
</P>
<P>
   That RealNetworks and Microsoft happen to be rivals has only
added intrigue to the race, and Cantwell herself is a noteworthy
candidate in several respects. While other high-technology
millionaires have run for the Senate, she is the first from the
Internet industry. And, as the National Women's Political Caucus
puts it, no other woman has brought a greater bankroll earned
entirely by herself to a race for major office.
</P>
<P>
   After spending $5 million and scoring a decisive victory in
Tuesday's Democratic primary, Cantwell is generating huge attention
for one more reason: she might just win in November.
</P>
<P>
   Several statewide polls have shown her close to _ or in one
case, dead even with _ Gorton. And aside from her money and
relentless pitch as the candidate of the ``New Economy,'' several
other factors have helped to tighten a contest that now offers
Democrats a solid chance to pick up a Senate seat that had once
seemed safe for the incumbent.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, at 72 and a fixture of public life here for more
than 40 years, Gorton finds himself facing eerie parallels in
Cantwell's themes to those he invoked in 1980, when he ended the
44-year career of Sen. Warren Magnuson, then 75.
</P>
<P>
   For that race, Gorton pointedly jogged to the state capital in
Olympia to file papers for his candidacy. And in one TV spot,
showing him running through a park in Spokane, an announcer asked
viewers to imagine a senator ``who is still in the prime of his
life.''
</P>
<P>
   Now Cantwell is stressing this time-for-a-new-generation theme.
She reminds voters that Gorton has been in elected office for about
as long as she has been alive, and says that it is time for a
``vigorous'' senator with ``new ideas.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Cantwell has picked up on environmentalists'
continuing ire over a legislative maneuver by Gorton last year. He
attached a rider to a bill providing aid to Kosovo war victims that
assisted a Texas company's bid to open a cyanide-leach gold mine in
rural Washington. Cantwell repeatedly accuses Gorton of advocating
``19th century solutions to 21st century problems.''
</P>
<P>
   That is a characterization officials at Microsoft, who describe
Gorton as a leader on high-technology issues, would surely
challenge. Gorton has been a visceral critic of the Justice
Department's antitrust suit against the company, and his ties to
Microsoft have been strengthened by several visits he made to the
corporate campus in Redmond, at which he has received detailed
briefings on just how Microsoft products work.
</P>
<P>
   To judge by federal election records, there is little question
that Gorton is Microsoft's candidate.
</P>
<P>
   The corporate political action committee has given him $10,000,
and Gates, the chairman, as well as Steven A. Ballmer, the chief
executive, have each contributed the maximum of $2,000 for this
election cycle. All told, Microsoft employees have contributed
$97,925 through Aug. 30, according to the nonpartisan Campaign
Study Group of Springfield, Va.
</P>
<P>
   Cantwell has received just $8,500 from Microsoft workers, none
of them top officials. But she has received $47,300 from
RealNetworks employees. And the company's billionaire founder, Rob
Glaser, has held fund-raisers for her.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Far more importantly, Glaser did the favor of hiring her as one
of the company's first employees shortly after she was voted out of
Congress in the Republican tide of 1994, a move that ultimately
turned her into a millionaire many times over. Starting as vice
president for marketing, she rose to become senior vice president
for the consumer and e-commerce division.
</P>
<P>
   Glaser, who once worked at Microsoft, earned its continuing
wrath when he testified in Congress two years ago that Microsoft
had tried to sabotage his technology with code written into a
competing software program, a charge Microsoft denied.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM
</P>
<P>
   As intriguing as the supporting roles of Seattle's cybertitans
in this campaign are, it is unlikely that Cantwell, if she wins,
will call herself ``the senator from RealNetworks'' _ or carry on
any feud with a company that is, along with Boeing, the most
important employer in the state.
</P>
<P>
   She opposes the Justice Department's proposal to break up
Microsoft. And officials at both companies say there are all kinds
of legislative high-technology issues on which they agree, and they
have been partners on some business projects.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``Even before RealNetworks existed, Maria was an effective and
outspoken advocate in Congress for Microsoft and the technology
industry as a whole,'' said Alex Alben, RealNetworks' vice
president for government affairs.
</P>
<P>
   And Vivek Varma, a Microsoft spokesman, said that if Cantwell
becomes a senator, ``we'd work fine with her. We worked well with
Maria when she was in Congress. But Slade has been a real leader on
all the issues affecting Microsoft, and he's earned our strong
support.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Money remains a big issue in this campaign _ both Cantwell's,
and that of several Native American tribes, who have feuded with
Gorton for years and now vow to spend $2 million or more to defeat
him.
</P>
<P>
   Gorton has accused Cantwell of trying to buy the election, and
his campaign offers a pie chart depicting how little money the
Democrat is taking in from ``Real People'' as opposed to
``Herself.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``She will come after us with $10 million,'' Gorton said
recently. ``She simply writes another check.''
</P>
<P>
   Gorton also says Washington needs his seniority and influence _
a point Magnuson used before Gorton ousted him.
</P>
<P>
   Cantwell was considered a rising star when she was elected to
the state Legislature at the age of 28 and to Congress six years
later. But in 1994, she was defeated for re-election from a
suburban Seattle district that includes Microsoft's campus in
Redmond.
</P>
<P>
   If her political career seemed washed up at the time, her
financial position skyrocketed after Glaser brought her aboard at
RealNetworks. And the fortune she quickly made there allowed her to
jump back into politics.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Despite her millions, or perhaps because of them, Cantwell has
taken pains to portray her life as unassuming. Never married, she
lives in a modest suburban home with her mother and their dog,
Chuck, a Yorkshire terrier that the campaign describes as diabetic.

   DOT.CAUSE: When Colleen Minton of Grant Park participates in the
three-day Walk for Breast Cancer Awareness starting today, she'll
have an extra glide in her stride. She helped raise $31,000 for the
event by organizing some local technology companies called
``Dot.Coms for a Cause.'' The 29-year-old, who works for the
Internet service company Celarix, says she was motivated after
learning of thousands of women who are affected by the disease. She
also was concerned about perceptions that dot-commers are
trust-fund computer geeks who are out of touch. ``We all work long
hours trying to build our business, but we're not too busy to
volunteer in our communities,'' she says. In July, Minton's group
held a fund-raiser at King Plow Arts Center with several Atlanta
artists putting their work on the block. Minton hopes to raise even
more next year.

   VOTE EARLY, OFTEN: The show is more than two months away, but
VH1 cable network has unveiled the categories for what is being
hyped as ``the first ever fully interactive music awards show.''
The categories for the ``VH1 Music Awards'' have been whittled from
the mere 100,000 entries suggested by fans to a more manageable two
dozen. Among the categories for the Nov. 30 show: Coolest Fan
Website, Best Legal Download and Most Entertaining Public Feud
(anybody seen Eminem?). Of course, there's the humdrum Album of the
Year. Fans can vote online through Oct. 10 to trim the nominations
to five finalists in each category. The next round of voting starts
Oct. 20, with the online polls closing the night of the telecast.

 &HT;    What college exams? These Georgia students want to pass the ...
 &HT;    By Phil Kloer
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Nearly 400 college students took the ultimate
pass-fail test Thursday in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Pass and you go on to the next round of qualifying to be a
contestant on ABC's ``Who Wants to Be a Millionaire.''
</P>
<P>
   Fail and you're out on the sidewalk on Peachtree Street under a
heavy gray sky in a downpour.
</P>
<P>
   The hit game show's first in-person audition tour, solely for
undergraduate college students, took over the Ritz-Carlton Atlanta,
with young people standing in line as if for rock concert tickets,
extra security for crowd control, tension, elation and dejection.
But no Regis Philbin, who stayed in New York and let the show's
producers and contestant wranglers cull the herd.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't even have a car, that's how desperate I am to win the
money,'' said Josh Buckley, 19, who drove three hours with a friend
from the University of Montevallo in Alabama to stand in line on
the sidewalk at 8 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't realize it was going to be so packed,'' said Kelly
Cunningham, a broadcast journalism major from the University of
Georgia, as rain ran down her vinyl hood into her face. She was
part of the second long line of ``Millionaire'' wannabes, assembled
at 1 p.m. in a steady drizzle.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Millionaire'' auditions were at 9 a.m., 2 p.m. and 7 p.m.,
with 125 students per session allowed in and many more turned away.
Once inside, the chosen few had to show tuition bills to prove they
were students, swear that no one in their immediate family was
employed by ABC and then take a written test. Fifteen minutes, 30
questions, putting four items into a specific order, like the
``Fastest Finger'' quiz on the show.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was nothing like a college test,'' said Michelle Casey, a
computer science major at Georgia State University. ``It was really
hard. You can study for a college test.''
</P>
<P>
   After the test, the pass-fail results were announced to the
room, causing grins and groans. ``I'm freakin' brilliant, and I'm
not gonna be on the show!'' wailed Sarah Duckworth, a Georgia State
history major, after hearing that she hadn't passed.
</P>
<P>
   ``So we're gonna be known as the losers?'' Emory University
freshman Dan Rosenthal said to his friend Marci Chetrit after they
both got the boot.
</P>
<P>
   Those who passed (about half in the first group of 125, though
``Millionaire'' producers wouldn't say what a passing score was)
got six-minute videotaped interviews. Seven small booths, cordoned
off with black curtains, were set up in a Ritz-Carlton conference
room.
</P>
<P>
   Producers asked the students about their lives and why they
wanted to be on the show. Jamie Cheung, a Georgia Tech computer
science major, explained that she was getting free tuition from an
FBI scholarship and would become an FBI agent when she graduates.
</P>
<P>
   Cheung has one possible advantage: The producers are looking for
diversity. ``Millionaire'' contestants have been overwhelmingly
white and male since the show debuted in August 1999. The phone-in
screening process makes it impossible to adjust the mix of
contestants, and ABC and ``Millionaire'' Executive Producer Michael
Davies have said they wish the show had a broader range of faces.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to try to have a really good mix of players,''
Nikki Webber, coordinating producer, said Thursday. ``We want a lot
of diversity.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people talk about that, but even here in line, it's
predominantly white males,'' said Tiffany Adams, an Emory education
major, while waiting to get in. ``Being an African-American woman
makes me a double minority, but it won't make it any easier.''
</P>
<P>
   Auditions also are being held in Boston, Washington, Los Angeles
and Chicago. Thirty students will be chosen, to be notified Oct.
20. Three all-college shows will tape in November and are scheduled
to air Dec. 19-21.

 &HT;    Blass line tepid, Halston hot
 &HT;    By A. Scott Walton
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The transition is complete for Bill Blass' signature
label.
</P>
<P>
   Blass, who ran his company for nearly half a century, sold it
last year because of increasing frailty and weariness with the
fashion industry.
</P>
<P>
   Blass' retirement affected two fashion houses: his own and
Halston's. The new design chief at Blass, Steven Slowik, debuted
with a spring collection Thursday that was only good enough to draw
halting applause, but not so awful that it will cost him his job.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Craig Natiello, Blass' ace assistant until his
retirement, has clearly found his niche as the Halston design
honcho. His assortment of springy shirtdresses, sleeveless
sweaters, ball gowns and shirts paired with matching slacks, also
shown Thursday, was extravagant yet simple.
</P>
<P>
   Natiello described his second effort for Halston as ``an
item-driven collection'' from which women would pick and choose.
But it was clear that he focused on a select few themes that worked
together as a complete wardrobe.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just took the most basic shapes and represented them in the
most luxurious fabrics,'' Natiello said backstage.
</P>
<P>
   Most of his clothes were flecked, sprayed or drenched in gold
lace, sequins or embroidery. He also used sequins for mesmerizing
paisley patterns, and he played with leopard prints and shades of
blush pink, aqua blue and cherry red as well.
</P>
<P>
   But it was shirtdresses _ belted, not buttoned _ and blouses
knotted at the navel that served as the collection's cornerstones.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole shirtdress thing came from the gown I did for my
date to an awards show; someone called it (Lauren) Bacall-esque,''
Natiello explained.
</P>
<P>
   Thus the show started with Humphrey Bogart's voice intoning that
famous line from ``Casablanca,'' ``Here's looking at you, kid.''
Mostly, though, the models marched to the tune of Sister Sledge's
disco anthem ``He's the Greatest Dancer,'' which hailed Halston's
heyday. No wonder the record kept skipping.
</P>
<P>
   Judging from the sheepish bow that Slowik took after the Blass
show, he probably wished he could skip spring 2001 and move right
to next fall. Looking at his clothes, it appeared that he
concentrated too much on doing innovative things with necklines and
shoulder displays and too little on making sure his suits and
dresses were appealing in shape or fabrication.
</P>
<P>
   The collection did include some silver-and-black sequined tweeds
that looked amazingly glossy and fluid. But it also contained
outfits bogged down by oddly placed beaded butterflies and
starbursts. And all of Slowik's contrived ways with floating
necklines, shoulder ruffles and straps acted only as unnecessary
distractions.
</P>
<P>
   One designer who apparently suffers no distractions is Helmut
Lang. The reclusive Austrian, who never takes a post-show bow,
previewed colorless (black, white, brown and tan) men's and women's
collections Thursday that stuck to just three ideas: perforated
leather; slim, sharply tailored suits; and bondage-style straps.
</P>
<P>
   Lang's leathers were poked so full of holes that wearing them in
warm weather would almost make sense. His suits were exquisitely
cut to make his models look even taller and thinner than they are.
But it was the way Lang outfitted women to look like
semi-respectable dominatrixes that will keep him where he belongs:
out of the mainstream. Of all the ways designers have tried to
reinterpret styles from the 1980s this Fashion Week, perhaps only
Lang would pay homage to S&AMP;M.
</P>
<P>
   And speaking of masochism: Who wears ribbed turtlenecks, suede
duster coats, double-face wool suits or fur coats in the
summertime? Michael Kors must know enough people who can jet off to
New Mexico spas on a whim and never feel the heat that he dedicated
his entire collection to them.
</P>
<P>
   Kors is probably America's best overall designer and certainly
its best dream-weaver of winterwear, but the man works as if he's
never heard of global warming. He showed only a few fantastic men's
and women's pieces in cotton or linen for spring on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   All the suede, leather and cashmere pieces looked delectable.
But Hotlantans would be almost foolhardy to buy them, unless they
never leave artificially cooled environments or were shopping way
ahead for next fall.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Ralph Lauren made ``spectator'' sport of those who
would ``fix what ain't broken.'' Basing his women's collection on
that spring-summer prepwear staple, spectator shoes, Lauren showed
the same to-the-manner-born looks as always. His chic little
dresses and jackets were trimmed in leather. His skirts were hemmed
at a ladylike, midthigh length. Working almost exclusively in
brown, black, blue and white combinations, Lauren did updated
wonders with pinstripe and chevron patterns. His floral prints were
sedate. The only thing to criticize was his calculated immunity
from harsh critiquing.

 &HT;    Semi-retired bad boy of country Waylon Jennings still refusing
to kiss up
 &HT;    By Miriam Longino
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NASHVILLE _ Waylon Jennings is probably the last singer in
Nashville you would expect to find relaxing on a sofa in the early
morning sunlight, sipping iced tea as he looks out over a yard
landscaped with tight bunches of purple mums and the last of
summer's hostas.
</P>
<P>
   It all looks so orderly, calm, even peaceful _ a parallel
universe to the days when Jennings, loaded on pills, without sleep,
a cigarette in one hand and his Stratocaster guitar in the other,
would step on the stage of some smoky honky-tonk and growl into the
mike: ``The devil made me do it the first time/the second time I
done it on my own.''
</P>
<P>
   But here he is, country's baddest don't-mess-with-me outlaw,
starting the day talking about (of all things) empty-nest syndrome.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shooter lives in L.A. now,'' Jennings says, referring to his
21-year-old son, Shooter Jennings, the midlife child he had with
wife Jessi Colter during the height of his drugged-out and
pumped-up days as country music's wildest (and most creatively
authentic) act. ``He's great. He's the light of our lives, as you
can tell.''
</P>
<P>
   Shooter, who is pursuing a career as a rock musician, left home
_ and his doting parents _ in May.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're working through it, because he's been right there with
us for 21 years. But he said, `I want to go.' So we just bought a
house in Arizona because it gave us a good excuse to be closer to
him.''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, it's true. At 63, Jennings is about to put a For Sale sign
in the yard of his longtime Nashville home, the sprawling
contemporary on the southwestern edge of town that tourists have
gawked at for years. The event is more than a sensible,
retirement-age decision. Though he is touring again (with a show
Saturday at Lanierland Music Park) and is about to release a new
live album that rivals his best work of the early 1970s, Jennings
has had it with Nashville.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are some people we'll miss,'' he says, looking thinner
and sounding a bit more tired than the strapping days of black hats
and leather vests. Then a wry smile creeps across his face. ``But
very few.''
</P>
<P>
   In today's slick world of teen-oriented country music, Jennings
is definitely Old School. To the young executives who now control
Music Row, he represents a time when country was long Cadillacs,
dirty fingernails and drugstore cowboys. A time when artists like
Jennings could hang up on disc jockeys who kept them on hold too
long, lay down take after take in a cocaine-drenched recording
studio until they got a song right, and generally tell everyone
around them that if they didn't like it, they could kiss their
you-know-what.
</P>
<P>
   The behavior may seem appalling to the carefully controlled and
politically correct chiefs of today's Nashville, but millions of
fans sensed that it was real _ that Waylon Jennings was the real
deal, telling it like it is. Older, wiser, sober and slowed down
due to heart problems and diabetes, he still does.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of people in this business now who don't know
what they're doing. That have no earthly idea,'' he says in the
folksy, blunt baritone that narrated ``The Dukes of Hazzard.''
``This whole business here is just a joke. It's going down now like
the great Titanic because they are in control of it, the suits.
What is that about?
</P>
<P>
   ``They are supposed to work for you. But they've got it turned
around now to where the artists work for them, and that's wrong.
It's not that I have my music, my music has me. I would have done
it for nothing. But they've got these kids now jumping through
hoops, and it all sounds like an imitation. Some of 'em come and
ask me what to do, and I say `tell 'em to blow it up their
(expletive deleted).'''
</P>
<P>
   No one like him
</P>
<P>
   It's not likely that many of the young acts now negotiating
careers in the competitive world of country music would dare to
bite the hand that signs the checks. But Jennings has always kept
one black boot squarely on the backside of the industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, just about everybody in country music has had
somebody to come along and replace them,'' says Grand Ole Opry star
Connie Smith. ``But no one has ever tried to sound like Waylon
Jennings.''
</P>
<P>
   Born into a West Texas family of dirt-poor cotton pickers (``All
you had to do was look at the floor to know it was true,'' he has
said), the singer-songwriter escaped harsh poverty by working the
raucous honky-tonk circuit of the dust-blown Southwest. Endless
nights of playing in front of the rough, beer-chugging crowds of
the 1960s made him as prickly as a saguaro cactus, creating one of
country music's most distinctive sounds and styles along the way.
</P>
<P>
   Everything about him seemed cocky, from his slick pompadour to
the Salem cigarette that always seemed to be dangling from the
corner of his mouth. Likewise, his songs reflected a working-class
pride and a uniquely American, don't-tread-on-me spirit, with
titles such as ``Lonesome, On'ry and Mean,'' ``I've Always Been
Crazy,'' ``Ain't Livin' Long Like This'' and ``Ramblin' Man.''
Never formally trained in music, Jennings relied simply on the
plucking sound of a guitar and his guttural, country vocals to make
his mark. In 1976, he did.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wanted: The Outlaws'' is still considered one of country
music's watershed albums. Released in the spring of that year, it
featured tunes by Jennings, Colter, buddy Willie Nelson and
Nashville singer-songwriter Tompall Glaser. Perhaps as impressive
as the music was the album's packaging. RCA Records released the
songs (many recorded years earlier) in a sepia-toned cardboard
sleeve designed to look like an Old West wanted poster. For the
first time, the progressive music being made by these artists (who
collectively were bucking the tightly controlled Nashville studio
system) was branded ``outlaw'' music. Critics called the sound
``landmark.'' The public gobbled it up.
</P>
<P>
   For nearly a decade, Jennings was country music's seminal
artist, recording a string of No. 1 hits and wielding unprecedented
power on Music Row. He spent money as fast as he made it,
eventually racking up a $120,000-a-year cocaine habit and $2
million in debt. Rather than entering a rehab program or filing
bankruptcy, he stripped down his lifestyle, paid off his debts and
eventually went cold turkey (with only Colter at his side) at a
cabin in the Arizona desert.
</P>
<P>
   That was 1988. But the six-pack-a-day cigarette habit and drugs
had taken their toll. Jennings suffered a heart attack, underwent
open heart surgery and was told ``slow down, or else.'' Buoyed by
his wife and young son, the outlaw hung up his guns. But the
straighter, sober entertainer returned to Nashville only to find
changes on Music Row.
</P>
<P>
   Outlaws were out
</P>
<P>
   As young Garth Brooks' star was exploding with a hybrid of
honky-tonk country and arena rock, Jennings' brand of rebellious
outlaw music was out of vogue. Though he recorded several albums in
the late '80s and '90s, Jennings watched incredulously as stars
like Brooks (whom Jennings has called ``the most insincere'' person
he's ever met) yes ma'amed and yessir-ed their way up music charts
and into industry favor. At one point, Colter says, the couple
decided to call it quits.
</P>
<P>
   ``But what I love about him is that he's always remained the
same. He's not ever awed by those kinds of things,'' she says,
looking across the sunken living room at her husband. ``Something
about that hard blowing wind down in Texas. If you survive that, it
(the music) never leaves you.''
</P>
<P>
   Quite unexpectedly, Jennings found himself a frequent guest on
the Carl P. Mayfield morning show on Nashville country station
WKDF-FM. A former rock DJ, Carl P. has built one of the most
popular morning radio shows in town, primarily because of his sharp
wit and bluntly truthful humor. Finding similar qualities in
Jennings, he began ``Waylon Wednesdays,'' in which Jennings sits
behind the mike telling it like it is _ or at least how he sees it.
</P>
<P>
   Soon Jennings became much like an endearing old coot to young
country music artists on the rise. Traditionalists such as Brad
Paisley appear with him on the show. Others, such as Troy Gentry of
the Waylon-wannabe group Montgomery Gentry, don't hesitate to call
him The Man.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you hear all these rap acts talking about being an
original gangster, you wanna laugh, because long before all these
rap guys were talking about life in their world, Waylon and Willie
and all those Texas guys were telling it like it is for rednecks
and people like us,'' Gentry says. ``He defined the idea of
`Outlaw.' He always did it his way. He reminds us what's important,
because he's a model of the way country music ought to be made _
feelin' it straight from the heart.''
</P>
<P>
   On Oct. 10, Gentry, Eddie Montgomery, Travis Tritt and John
Anderson pay the ultimate tribute to their honky-tonk hero when the
live CD ``Waylon and the Waymore Blues Band'' hits stores. Recorded
at the historic Ryman Auditorium, the CD returns Jennings to what
he does best _ raw, live performing. In addition to such hits as
``Waymore's Blues'' and ``Ramblin' Man'' (which Jennings hasn't
performed live in years), it features new tracks by country
funkmeister Tony Joe White that have Jennings growling as if he
were 30 years old and sniffing perfume.
</P>
<P>
   A renewed Colter
</P>
<P>
   Colter is also featured on the CD, singing her two signature
tunes, ``Storms Never Last'' and ``I'm Not Lisa.'' Looking as hip
and fresh as her days touring with the Outlaws, Colter is obviously
Jenning's touchstone, following each of his cheeky barbs with a
soothing remark that turns the rhetorical volume down a bit. It's
obvious her promising recording career took a backseat to the
emotional care and feeding of her husband, whom she still seems to
adore. Looking to her after every comment, it's obvious he would be
lost without her.
</P>
<P>
   An additional treat on the new CD, and in concert at Lanierland
on Saturday, is the Waymore Blues Band, which is mostly a reunion
of Jennings' original Wailers. If you can get to Cumming, it's a
rare chance to see one of country's legends (he hates that word)
performing tunes that are significant pieces of Nashville history.
Nor will the new material disappoint. The group performs as an
ensemble, with Jennings trading licks with his band, while Colter
pops in and out to do tunes.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be honest with you, I don't work at getting hit records
anymore,'' Jennings says, resting a black boot on the coffee table
in front of him. ``If they don't want to play my records, that's
OK. I won't do the kiss-up. I never did, and I never will.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll let 'em have some records if they kiss up to me,'' he
laughs. ``That's the way it works.''

NEWS OF THE GREAT WHITE WAY 
</HEADLINE>
   By JESSE McKINLEY    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   What's Playing at Ford Center?
</P>
<P>
   It is one of Broadway's grandest theaters, a triumph of
restoration and modern stage technology, a handsome, big-time
musical-theater theater. Its got location, history and class. So
why, some Broadway types are asking, isn't the Ford Center for the
Performing Arts booked?
</P>
<P>
   The theater, on West 42nd Street between Seventh and Eighth
Avenues, was most recently the home of a revival of Andrew Lloyd
Webber's ``Jesus Christ Superstar,'' which closed a money-losing
run on Sept. 3. It's not surprising that a new show hasn't opened
since; stagehands at the Ford are still finishing the standard
technical makeover that every theater undergoes after a show
closes.
</P>
<P>
   What is surprising to some Broadway professionals, however, is
that the theater has not yet booked a replacement. Almost every
other major musical house on Broadway has a show running or on the
horizon.
</P>
<P>
   But the theater may not be empty for long, if officials at SFX
Entertainment, the theater's owner, have their way. (SFX acquired
the theater last year when it bought Livent, the bankrupt Canadian
production company.)
</P>
<P>
   John Barlow, spokesman for the SFX Theatrical Group, said
Thursday that the group had narrowed the list to three potential
spring bookings, all of which are revivals.
</P>
<P>
   They are ``42nd Street,'' whose latest incarnation opened on
Sunday in Amsterdam; ``Wonderful Town,'' the 1953 Leonard Bernstein
musical, which had a brief but acclaimed run at City Center in May;
and ``West Side Story,'' another Bernstein gem, with lyrics by
Stephen Sondheim and a book by Arthur Laurents, which played La
Scala in Milan in July.
</P>
<P>
   Barlow said a deal was expected in the next two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the reason for the Ford's vacancy is plain old bad luck.
For many months it looked as if the next tenant would be the
acclaimed British revival of ``Oklahoma!'' produced by Cameron
Mackintosh. In July it was announced that the production would not
come to New York because of its artistic team's scheduling
conflicts.
</P>
<P>
   Such scheduling woes are not limited to SFX; the same fate also
recently befell the Shubert Organization, which saw its
long-planned spring production of the musical ``The Visit''
collapse because of the lack of a leading lady, meaning the
Broadway Theater has no booking beyond Dec. 31.
</P>
<P>
   But the Ford Center also presents other challenges. The first is
its size. With more than 1,800 seats the Ford is Broadway's
second-largest theater, after the giant gray Gershwin (pop. 1,933).
No one can accuse the Ford of being homely; its chandeliers are the
best on Broadway, but its size makes it hard for smaller musicals.
</P>
<P>
   More important, the Ford may still be suffering from the curse
of Garth. In 1997 the theater was restored _ or rather, recreated _
from two other theaters, the Lyric and Apollo. The builder was
Garth Drabinsky, the flamboyant Canadian producer whose company,
Livent, later went bankrupt.
</P>
<P>
   Drabinsky had a yen for big contracts and because of deals
struck with the unions the Ford emerged as one of the most
expensive in New York to run. Part of this, too, went back to the
theater's size; it takes a large staff to keep it running.
</P>
<P>
   But the theater also has several elements that increase costs,
from its unusual marquee (all those light bulbs aren't cheap) to
the fact that the presence of the Ford name on the theater limits
other potential sponsorship deals.
</P>
<P>
   While conceding that the Ford is more expensive to run, Barlow
said that the theater did not cost any more than any other theater
on Broadway to maintain when it was dark. He also said that while
the Ford's size might eliminate certain smaller productions, it
also makes for an enormous potential gross. A sell-out week at the
Ford can bring in more than $900,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's got one of the highest gross potential of any on
Broadway,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   When, of course, there's a show.
</P>
<P>
   Two in One
</P>
<P>
   When John Henry Redwood was a student at Thomas Jefferson High
School in Brooklyn, he played both offense and defense in football.
``There were no squads back then,'' Redwood said, laughing. ``You
went for the ball on one side of the field, and you went after the
guy with the ball on the other.''
</P>
<P>
   That double duty was probably good training for Redwood,
considering his recent schedule. Every morning he has been going to
a rehearsal as the book writer and lyricist for ``The
In-Gathering,'' a new musical presented by the New Professional Co.
at the Duke Theater on 42nd Street. In the evening he walks three
blocks west to perform as as an actor in ``A Lesson Before Dying,''
at the Signature Theater Company.
</P>
<P>
   Redwood has long been artistically ambidextrous. A former marine
who began acting in the mid-1970s, he has appeared in 10
productions of August Wilson's ``Fences'' alone, in regional
theaters across the country. But theater aficionados may know him
best as the author of ``The Old Settler,'' a portrait of an
African-American woman battling spinsterhood. The play, presented
at Primary Stages in 1998, was one of the most produced new shows
of the last two seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Redwood, who appears to be in his 50s _ his actor side wouldn't
permit him to divulge his age _ said he came to writing as a
diversion from a doctoral thesis. (He has two masters degrees, in
history and religion.) ``I saw a book called `How to Survive Your
Ph.D. Dissertation' in the library, and one of the things it
suggested was playwriting,'' Redwood said. ``They shouldn't have
books like that in the library.''
</P>
<P>
   Along the Way
</P>
<P>
   _ Laila Robins has been cast opposite Richard Thomas in Second
Stage's production of Edward Albee's ``Tiny Alice.'' It opens in
early December.
</P>
<P>
   _ In something of a rarity, the cast of ``Copenhagen'' _ with no
songs and even less dance _ will record its original cast recording
on Thursday. The producer is Bruce Kimmel.
</P>
<P>
   _ American Place Theater's next show is ``Tabletop,'' a comedy
about the filming of a commercial: Another rarity during the
actors' strike. Performances begin in October.

   IRAN-WOMEN (Tehran, Iran) _ The law in Iran requires women to
cover their hair and to conceal the shape of their bodies in loose
clothing. So one of the coolest things to do in Tehran these days
is to get a nose job. It is so cool that unlike women in many
places, who hide the chiseling and sawing and stretching that has
been done to their faces, Iranian women wear their post-surgical
bandages like badges of honor, or at least indicators of a certain
degree of wealth. By Elaine Sciolino.

   HE'S A SPOKESMAN, NOT A USER _ Priceline.com shareholder and
celebrity spokesman William Shatner was expected to disclose
Thursday on``48 Hours'' that he has never used the company's
Internet site to buy discounted airline tickets. Shatner, who has
appeared in humorous commercials for Priceline.com, said he had yet
to use the Internet-buying service. ``I haven't, because if I have
to fly, I think of myself as having to fly first-class,'' Shatner
told CBS. The television news magazine also will look at why more
than 300 customers have filed complaints about the Web site, which
allows shoppers to name their price for items such as hotel rooms,
airline tickets and groceries, CBS said. ``We're certainly not
disputing the number of complaints,'' Brian Ek, a Priceline.com
spokesman, told Bloomberg News. ``But during the same time we sold
over 5 million airline tickets, which is one complaint for every
17,000 tickets sold. That's like filling Madison Square Garden with
people and only one person is unhappy.''

   LOST OPPORTUNITY? Businesses are barely scratching the surface
when it comes to using the Internet to become more efficient,
productive and profitable, according to a study by the University
of Texas at Austin. ``If businesses focus their technology
investments in the right areas, there is no reason they can't
achieve significant productivity gains for the foreseeable
future,'' said Dr. Anitesh Barua, a co-director of the study
conducted by UT's Center for Research in Electronic Commerce.
Researchers surveyed more than 1,000 business and found that while
most have Web sites, they have failed to redesign their processes
for e-business practices such as information sharing, quality
monitoring and supplier selection. The study, sponsored by Dell
Computer, also found that while 74 percent of businesses provide
basic product information online, only 55 percent provide any
online customization; only 44 percent notify customers of their
order status; and only 29 percent have any capability to report
customer feedback and quality issues to suppliers in real time.

 &HT;    A day at the beach
 &HT;    By Steve Hummer
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SIDNEY _ Dear readers, I am so sorry. Distracted by all the
other Olympic sports that ask their spectators to wear shoes, I
have done an inexcusably poor job of keeping you current on the
beach volleyball front.
</P>
<P>
   I should be punished. I should be _ ATTENTION EDITORS _ forced
to return to this sunny cove with its warm tan sand and unbroken
cliff views. And ordered to keep coming back until I fully grasp
the sport's importance.
</P>
<P>
   This is one of Australia's beaches reputed to protect the right
to bare charms. But, frankly, I am skeptical. Here was an afternoon
just screaming all-over tan. But after doing surveillance that
would shame a military satellite, I noted practically no
toplessness. I suspect Olympic fraud. It is a story that bears
follow-up.
</P>
<P>
   If pinned down by the Italian women's team, a person could be
made to admit that beach volleyball deserves serious treatment. It
is one of the hottest shows in these Olympics, filling a
10,000-seat stadium with unrelentingly joyous fans. It was hot,
too, in 1996, but believe me, we ain't in Jonesboro anymore.
</P>
<P>
   Beach volleyball on an actual beach _ and here the waves
practically drag the ushers out to sea _ is an idea that might take
off.
</P>
<P>
   Further justifying the need for extensive coverage is the fact
that the two two-women U.S. teams just advanced to the
quarterfinals. Must be important because NBC assigned Bill Walton
to cover the sand. To show you how tape-delayed all this is,
though, listen closely to the next telecast. You just might hear
Walton pleading for Patty Hearst to come home.
</P>
<P>
   But I am a serious sports journalist. I like my Olympics
traditional. You start pumping loud music and a running commentary
into all the venues, and pretty soon fencing will lose that
15th-century appeal.
</P>
<P>
   ``It feels like a barbie. It's a picnic. It's one big party
atmosphere,'' said Murray Frahey of his beach volleyball haunt. He
is a local actor/comedian dressed in a red candy-stripe outfit who
prowls the edge of these matches keeping the crowd loose. He
orchestrates waves, stokes partisanship, makes noise. In the midst
of one match featuring the Australian women, Frahey threw himself
into the stands to interview one of their parents.
</P>
<P>
   You think it's easy sitting there trying to diagram the various
sets and study the various strategies for my in-depth game analysis
while a 400-pound Brazilian dances in the stands to a two-piece
band playing the theme from ``Hawaii Five-O?''
</P>
<P>
   Not a single moment is allowed to go quietly. Between the end of
one point and the start of the next serve, the air is filled with
booming chunks of music. KC and the Sunshine Band battle with
Aerosmith.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our venue is the best in Sydney,'' said Holly McPeak, the only
return Olympian on the U.S. women's team, suggesting that the rest
of the Games could take a cue from this upstart. What say we
surprise Marion Jones this week by blaring a little Zeppelin at her
just before the starter fires his gun.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to miss (the beach volleyball) when it's gone. It
can get boring here without the music,'' said Sheridan Wheeler, one
of several instructors lending more beach authenticity to the scene
by teaching kids to surf just behind the grandstands. In Australia,
such a class is practically college prep.
</P>
<P>
   You think it's easy getting to work when constantly stopping to
interview lovely young surf instructors?
</P>
<P>
   Nothing in the usual Olympic experience prepares a person for
what meets him at Bondi Beach. There was Annett Davis, after all,
raising the ball ready to serve for match point against the Cubans,
and Lenny Kravitz's ``American Woman'' still blared over the
towering sound system. How appalling. Everyone knows the original
Guess Who version was much better.
</P>
<P>
   Davis' partner is Jenny Johnson Jordan, whose father, Rafer
Johnson, was a soaring decathlete. He was on hand, enjoying another
generation's victory. He had to wonder, though, when they stole his
Olympics and replaced them with Spring Break.
</P>
<P>
   You know, if they keep fooling around giving me assignments like
this, I'm going to demand a big cut in pay.

 &HT;    Vote with your remote for the new fall shows
 &HT;    By Diane Holloway

<TEXT>
<P>
   As the presidential campaign shifts into final gear, the new TV
season gets under way.
</P>
<P>
   You've probably noticed that summer rerun season has been
especially long this year _ an unhappy situation necessitated by
the late-arriving Summer Olympics. We've slogged through
``Survivor,'' muddled through ``Who Wants to Be a Millionaire'' and
a few reality also-rans. Now it's time to get down to business, the
prime-time entertainment business, with real series written by real
writers and starring real actors.
</P>
<P>
   Much was written months ago about the absence of ``buzz'' around
the new TV season, but I think that may have had more to do with
the fact that previews arrived four months before the shows. Why
bother to buzz about something that's so far away? It's like trying
to get voters to pay attention to the November election before
Labor Day.
</P>
<P>
   As usual, a lot of new shows should be studiously ignored. Think
of them as fifth-party candidates. Some shows are worth a glance, a
few are promising and a handful are actually contenders. To help
you cast an educated vote in this fall's TV campaign, here's our
handy guide. Mark you ballots and set your VCRs. You want to be an
educated viewer/voter, don't you? And, as always, watch and debate
amongst yourselves.

   ' Ed'
</P>
<P>
   (NBC, Oct. 8)
</P>
<P>
   Relative unknown Tom Cavanagh stars as Ed, a big-city lawyer who
gets fired and comes home to find his wife in bed with another man.
What to do? He moves back to his hometown of Stuckeyville, Ohio,
buys a bowling alley and hawks 10-pin fun and legal advice. In his
spare time, he romances his high-school sweetheart, Carol (Julie
Bowen). This isn't as icky-sweet as it sounds. It's more charming
and quirky, a la ``Northern Exposure.'' Not a lot of guffaws but
plenty of gentle smiles.

   `Hype'
</P>
<P>
   (WB, Oct. 8)
</P>
<P>
   A large cast of complete unknowns does over-the-top, frantically
paced sketch comedy. The presentation tape, which was not supposed
to be for review but is the only thing available, shows a
potentially sharp cast performing gross-out material that spoofs
pop culture.There's an emphasis on tasteless, off-color humor
geared to the younger-than-''Saturday Night Live'' set. And there's
an annoying overall hysteria in the air.

   (WB, Oct. 8)
</P>

   This tacky new sitcom stars Nikki Cox's chest. Really. There's
no attempt to direct attention to dialogue or the situation or even
her pretty face. It's about her chest. She plays a Las Vegas dancer
married to a would-be wrestler. They're supposed to be funny
together. The wildly lame show comes from ``The Drew Carey Show''
creator Bruce Helford, who used to have talent.

   `Yes, Dear'
</P>
<P>
   (CBS, Oct. 2)

   Here's a worn out premise: Two couples with different
child-rearing philosophies collide with allegedly hilarious
results. Kim hyperventilates when her baby refuses to stand up and
walk on time; her sister, Christine, however, barely notices when
her kids refuse to eat or when she runs over the neighbor's cat.
Har har. There's one funny scene in the pilot, a computerized
gimmick with Kim's baby.

   `Tucker'
</P>
<P>
   (NBC, Oct. 2)
</P>
<P>
   A grosser version of ``Malcolm in the Middle,'' this sitcom is
about a 14-year-old boy, winningly played by Eli Marienthal
(``American Pie''). When his parents get divorced, he and his
mother move into the crowded home of his crass aunt (Katey Sagal)
and her idiot son, Leon. Tucker's life is one big embarrassment,
from Leon's disgusting human hair collection to the aunt's
misbegotten conviction that he's trying to see her naked. The only
light in Tucker's life is the pretty girl next door. This show has
some funny moments, but it lacks the intelligence and innocence
that elevate ``Malcolm.''

   Oliver Platt is a refreshing addition to TV, and the
star-studded supporting cast of Dick Wolf's latest drama includes
Bebe Neuwirth, Tom Conti and Lili Taylor. But ... the pilot doesn't
do a good job of blending the newspaper and crime-fighting
elements. Platt plays Wallace Benton, a New York columnist (based
on Jimmy Breslin), who uses his enormous ego and a group of
journalism students to right wrongs and solve crimes. The pilot has
a truthful ring or two (such as Benton screaming at his computer),
but it also has Benton asking cops to leave so he can interrogate a
murder suspect. Wolf wouldn't go that far astray on the superior
``Law &AMP; Order.''

   `Boston Public'
</P>
<P>
   (Fox, Oct. 23)
</P>
<P>
   Most TV critics hated this new high school drama _ which focuses
on the teachers rather than the students _ from David E. Kelley.
They said it was too sexual, too gross and too strange. Obviously
my colleagues haven't set foot in a high school in a long time. Chi
McBride holds things together as the intimidating but soft-hearted
principal, whose job is to deal with unruly students, burned-out
teachers and whining parents. Among the controversies dealt with in
the pilot: A teacher ends an affair with a student; a teacher
becomes the focus of an R-rated, student-produced computer cartoon;
and a teacher in charge of troubled students fires a gun in class
to get their attention. Irresponsible and illegal? Sure, but the
teacher will face repercussions. This isn't Kelley's best work, but
it's got lots of potential.

   This concept has certainly been beaten to death _ four women
living in the city, navigating professional and personal tides.
Promoted as an African American version of ``Sex and the City,''
it's not as R-rated or sex-obsessed. Kelsey Grammer is one of the
executive producers, a good sign, and the fresh new faces are
backed up with talent. Now, if only the scripts would rise to the

   `The Geena Davis Show'
</P>
<P>
   (ABC, Oct. 10)
</P>
<P>
   Well, yuck. There's something creepy about a sexy woman prancing
undressed around the home of the man she's engaged to while her
future stepson, an impressionable 14-year-old, drools over her.
This alleged family sitcom, with strong elements of (you guessed
it) ``Sex and the City,'' stars Oscar-winner Davis as a New York
careerwoman who falls in love with a suburban widower (Peter
Horton). If there is a dram of chemistry between Davis and Horton,
it isn't evident in the pilot. Nor is there an ounce of humor _
unless you're sick enough to laugh at the adolescent's ogling.

   `Dark Angel'
</P>
<P>
   (Fox, Oct. 3)
</P>
<P>
   James Cameron's first TV series is about as buoyant as the
Titanic. Critical opinion on this dark sci-fi drama split along
gender lines: Men liked it, while most women did not. The
leather-clad heroine, played by Jessica Alba (``Never Been
Kissed''), probably has something to do with it. The lumbering
two-hour pilot bounces between flashbacks to a group of genetically
enhanced kids with bar codes on their necks and the now grown-up
superwoman Max, a weary warrior in a post-apocalyptic future. The
language is crude, the dialogue cheap: ``I would have come sooner,
but I didn't,'' Max mutters. It's a future without civility or,
apparently, shampoo. Max joins forces with a resistance journalist
to buck the bad guys, but their crusade makes no sense.
</P>
<P>
   Grade: F

   `The Michael Richards Show'
</P>
<P>
   (NBC, Oct. 24)
</P>
<P>
   At press time, there was still no pilot for the former
``Seinfeld'' star's latest outing. Scenes that were screened for
critics months ago, as well as promotional spots running on NBC
now, indicate that Richards is again playing Kramer. Now Jerry's
wacky neighbor is named Vic Nardozza and working as a bumbling
Hollywood detective. If enough of the spotlight is spread to the
impressive supporting cast (including Tim Meadows, William Devane
and Bill Cobbs), this one could be swell _ especially for
unrepentant lovers of physical comedy.

   Delta Burke as the first lady, and David Alan Grier as a Secret
Service agent demoted from protecting the president to guarding the
first lady. Concept: first rate. Stars: excellent. Execution: What
in the world went wrong? The pacing of the pilot is clumsy, with
odd spaces of dead air and characters, except for Agent Daggett,
that are not remotely entertaining. The first lady is mean-spirited
and superficial, her daughters are obnoxious and the president is
stupid. For this premise to work, somebody besides Dag has to be
sharp. The network is said to be tinkering with future episodes, so
there's a slender ray of hope.

</P>
<P>
   Emmy winner Andre Braugher teams up with his ``Homicide''
producer-writer Paul Attanasio for this brooding medical drama.
Braugher plays an experimental oncologist. The premise is that
life-threatening illnesses give life meaning. The show itself isn't
on the same level as ``Homicide,'' but Braugher's intensity and
passion can make the phone book interesting, and Attanasio promises
to weigh in on meaty medical issues. The downside of this drama is
the demographically driven residents and interns whom Gideon
teaches _ pretty and handsome young things who add little to the
mix. But maybe they'll get better.

breasts and taping up her eyelids. But there's more to ``Bette,''
trust me. The Divine Miss M spoofs her own outrageous persona,
honing in on insecurities about age, weight, sex appeal and talent.
``I keep doing guest spots,'' she moans. ``Pretty soon I'll have my
own series and then I might as well kill myself.'' There's a
running gag in the pilot about Bette's bitterness toward Sally
Field, who beat her for an Oscar. Bigger-than-life Bette may rub
some viewers wrong, but in comedy, bigger is better and Bette is
huge.

   David Letterman's production company concocted this sitcom, and
the premise is vaguely autobiographical. Jim Gaffigan plays a
weatherman from Indiana who lands a job on a morning show in New
York where abrasive producer Christine Baranski rules the roost.
The stuffed-shirt anchorman, played by Rocky Carroll, instantly
feels threatened, much to Jim's surprise. Well-written with smart,
snappy dialogue, this one could click if the culture clash between
plain-spoken Midwesterner and sharp-barking New Yorkers stays on
track.

   Yes, I'm ashamed that I kind of liked this new soap from Aaron
Spelling. Maybe it's just nostalgia for the days of ``Dallas'' and
``Dynasty,'' but I wasn't the only critic who hooted at Spelling's
spoof of his own favorite genre. Victoria Principal plays the sweet
matron in a divorced family headed by Perry King. The exes have two
hunky sons and two luscious daughters. The sons are vying for
control of the family business, and the daughters are in love with
the same man. One of the sons, woodenly played by flex-happy Casper
Van Dien, has a history with his father's new fiancee, played by
super-babe Yasmine Bleeth. A very campy guilty pleasure.

   Sex, power and money _ not necessarily in that order _ are the
focus of this fast-paced drama from Darren Star, creator of
``Melrose Place'' and ``Sex and the City.'' A group of fast-trading
hot shots decide to leave a prestigious Wall Street brokerage firm
and strike out on their own. Will they make it? Of course, the
question is what they'll do with the lucrative proceeds after
hours. Besides making money, these folks like to make whoopee,
occasionally under kinky conditions. The eclectic mix includes an
ambitious good guy, played by Tom Everett Scott; Adam Goldberg as
the kinky guy with an ironic detachment from work; Rick Hoffman as
a major sexist pig; and Jennifer Connelly as a hard-charging
executive. Fresh faces, fine potential.

   This soft-focus, multigenerational family drama gets some heft
from classy Edward Hermann as (what else?) a stodgy, upper-crust
snob. But the heart of the show, which is sometimes a bit too
tender and precious, comes from the relationship between a
32-year-old single mother, played by Lauren Graham, and her
16-year-old daughter, winningly played by Alexis Bledel. To save
her daughter from the perils of an inner-city high school, the mom
decides to send her to an elite prep school. To pay for it,
however, she has to move home and sponge off her wealthy parents,
played by Hermann and Kelly Bishop. The concept is a bit strained,
but the relationships are worthwhile.

another crime might have happened by pumping a fake head with real

splattered. I'm sure this is realistic, but it was too darn gross

have mixed opinions about the decision. Her mother, played by Ellen

misery; her father, played by Paul Sorvino, tells her to follow her
dream. Rounding out this exceptional cast is Debi Mazar as Lydia's

   The local politics of Washington, D.C. _ populated by an African

make for great dramatic fodder. Unfortunately, that's not what this
cop show is about. Craig T. Nelson plays the city's crusading new
police chief who arrives to save the city ruled by an ineffective
black mayor (remember Marion Barry?) and a corrupt black police
deputy. White savior in a black city is an uncomfortable concept,
although the premise is based on the life of Jack Maple,a former
New York deputy police commissioner who headed police departments
in New Orleans and Philadelphia. Nelson is good as the quirky
commissioner, and the supporting cast, which includes Lynn Thigpen
and John Amos, is good, too. It's just hard to get past the white
savior element.

<TEXT>
<P>
   COLUMBUS, Ohio _ Laura Bush toured classrooms, posed with kids
for camera-wielding teachers and read to elementary school students
Thursday on a campaign stop for her husband, Republican
presidential nominee, Texas Gov. George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``He hopes that you all will read every night as much as you
watch TV,'' the Texan first lady told the kids. ``Reading takes
practice. . .it exercises your brain.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush sat in a rocking chair in the library of the Whitehall City
School, reading to 23 children, then smiled as Ohio first lady Hope
Taft read.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is what's really fun,'' Bush said, surrounded by Susan
Toney's first- and second-grade class as she talked to reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, who taught school for 10 years and has a master's degree
in library science, said she has focused on education and
children's issues in Texas, and would concentrate on the same
things if she succeeds Hillary Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about her husband's position on school vouchers, Bush was
quick to say he wants to let states and school districts decide
whether to give parents money to send children to private schools,
but isn't pushing vouchers.
</P>
<P>
   She was soon interrupted by a friendly ``Time's up!'' from Shai
Tutt, a second-grader who wanted some more attention.
</P>
<P>
   Shai, 7, already had called for ``three cheers for Mrs. Bush and
Mrs. Taft.''

   Jaguars tune up for Colts
</P>
<P>
   By Ken Sugiura
</P>
<P>
   You live life, you learn a few things.
</P>
<P>
   People in Southern California shouldn't build houses on cliffs.
People going to the beach shouldn't forget sunscreen.
</P>
<P>
   Players on the Jacksonville Jaguars shouldn't record a song
entitled, ``Uh-oh, the Jaguars Super Bowl Song,'' until they are
actually in the Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   The Jaguars made the mistake of laying down that rap track last
year, only to lose to Tennessee in the AFC playoffs. Uh-oh, indeed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had the slogan `Deeds, not words' around here,''
Jacksonville wide receiver Jimmy Smith said. ``And we don't want to
talk about the Super Bowl like we did the previous years.''
</P>
<P>
   No need this week. One of the biggest games of the early season
is Monday night, when Smith's Jaguars play Indianapolis. The Colts
and Jaguars are the defending champs of the AFC Central and East,
respectively.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just want to go out and take each game one week at a time
and win,'' Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   There is more reason for the Jaguars' changed attitude than
their humbling playoff ejection last year. They were Super Bowl
favorites last year, but it's much murkier now.
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee thumped them three out of three last year. The Jags'
offensive line has been severely banged up. Running back Fred
Taylor has yet to prove that he isn't as injury-prone as he is
talented. Oakland, Denver and Baltimore all look as if they will
challenge.
</P>
<P>
   The Colts also look like a possible Super Bowl team and will
test the Jaguars' defense. Baltimore quarterback Tony Banks threw
five touchdown passes against the Jaguars two weeks ago. Who knows
what Indy quarterback Peyton Manning will do?
</P>
<P>
   An offensive shootout seems to loom. When the patched-up Jaguars
line can give Mark Brunell protection, he is about as good as it
gets.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tell you, he is as accurate as he has ever been,'' Smith
said. ``He has had the best training camp he has ever had, and he
is as sharp as ever. The main concern is just keeping that guy
healthy with the banged-up offensive line that we have. So far, so
good.''
</P>
<P>
   Divisional matchup: Chicago, home against Detroit, has to be
desperate for a victory. The Bears, who have lost to undefeated
Minnesota, Tampa Bay and New York, have a much better chance Sunday
to win.
</P>
<P>
   Grudge match: The Washington-New York series goes back to 1932,
just shortly before Redskins defensive end Bruce Smith began his
career. After the Giants, Washington plays Tampa Bay, Philadelphia,
Baltimore, Jacksonville and Tennessee. It's a big game for the 3-0
Giants. It's monumental for Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Individual matchup: Seattle running back Ricky Watters and San
Diego linebacker Junior Seau were two of the game's best at their
position in the '90s. They're nearing the end of their careers, but
they still can do the job. Watters had his 31st career 100-yard
rushing game last week.
</P>
<P>
   Upset opportunity: Dallas has a short week to prepare for San
Francisco after upsetting Washington on Monday night. On top of
that, it can't be easy coming off the mountain after such a huge
win. The 49ers hung in against St. Louis last week. This might be
the week they get their first win.
</P>
<P>
   Fantasy play: Green Bay running back Dorsey Levens, who is
coming back from knee surgery, will play Sunday against Arizona,
one of the worst run defenses in the league.

 &HT;    Falcons seeking that special edge
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   FLOWERY BRANCH, Ga. _ Last year, the special teams of Falcons
assistant Joe DeCamillis got flagged by refs 20 times. This season,
DeCamillis' players are younger, more athletic and better able to
make plays without holding or clipping. As a result, those
penalties are down _ just two in three games. Atlanta is No. 5 in
the NFL in net punting average and No. 2 in average field position
after both kickoffs and kick returns.
</P>
<P>
   Several things must go right for the Falcons (2-1) to upset the
St. Louis Rams (3-0) Sunday in the Georgia Dome, and good
special-teams play would be a great asset.
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons think they have the players to make the plays. For
example, Gary Downs, Atlanta's best special-teams player in 1998,
is back after missing last season with a knee injury.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we're better than last year at this time,'' DeCamillis
said. ``(Rookie Mark) Simoneau is better than Ruffin Hamilton was.
Chris Draft, when he's healthy, is probably better than (Craig)
Sauer. We've got better personnel, and ... the key is wanting to do
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Rookie cornerback Darrick Vaughn leads the NFL with a 44.6-yard
kickoff-return average. Second-year safety Johndale Carty and
second-year middle linebacker Jeff Kelly are tied in special-teams
tackles with three each. Third-year cornerback Elijah Williams
blocked a punt at Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   Carty has become adept at lining up wide on punts and beating
blockers to get to opposing punt returners.
</P>
<P>
   ``It takes really wanting to make a play,'' Carty said. ``I work
... every day with (strength-and-conditioning coach) Al Miller ...
to get your hands right, your feet right, your eyes right.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coming off the ball, you have to watch the opposing players'
shoulder, or whatever your key is. Then, it's an all-out sprint,
usually for 40 to 60 yards.''
</P>
<P>
   Veterans are helping, too. Punter Dan Stryzinski's average of
41.6 yards is a yard-and-a-half better than his 11-year career
mark. Just six of 15 punts have been returned, five of them for a
combined 10 yards.
</P>
<P>
   But the Rams are a dangerous return team. Reserve wide receiver
Az-Zahir Hakim already has returned a punt 86 yards for a
touchdown. Kick returner Tony Horne led the NFL last year with a
29.7-yard average and has returned a kickoff for a touchdown
against the Falcons each of the past two seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``On special teams, we need to fight for field position, whether
it is on kick returns or coverage,'' coach Dan Reeves said. ``They
have the ability to score every time they touch the ball.''

   MEANS-COLUMN (Washington) _ Finally, Independent Counsel Robert
Ray has let President and Mrs. Clinton off the legal hook _ except

Whitewater mess. That's the American way _ and it stinks. By
MARIANNE MEANS. (Already filed.)
