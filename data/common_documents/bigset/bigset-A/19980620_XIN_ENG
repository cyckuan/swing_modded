<HEADLINE> TICAD to Note Role of Private Sector </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, June 19 (Xinhua) -- recent regional preparatory
committee meetings for the Tokyo international conference on
African development (TICAD) have stressed the need to promote the
growth of the private sector as a driving force in Africa's
development.
</P>
<P>
Reports on the preparatory meetings held in Ouagadougou,
Burkina Faso and Windhoek, Namibia were presented at the Harare
preparatory committee meeting for TICAD ii here Friday.
</P>
<P>
It was noted that the promotion of the private sector required
capacity building in the public sector so as to improve the
business environment.
</P>
<P>
Bernadette Artivor, Director for Development Cooperation of
Namibia's National Planning Commission said, ''there was broad
agreement on the importance of the private sector as the engine
of growth and the role it plays in employment generation and
poverty alleviation as well as in enabling countries to integrate
into the global economy.''
</P>
<P>
Presenting a report of the regional workshop for eastern and
southern Africa on the TICAD ii preparatory process held in
Windhoek, Artivor said it was appropriate that private sector
development was among the priority areas of the agenda for action
for African development to be adopted in Tokyo, Japan in October,
this year.
</P>
<P>
''The objectives of ensuring a conducive environment for
private sector development and promoting investment and trade
were also endorsed,'' Artivor said.

<HEADLINE> SADC Members Urged to Ratify Energy Protocol </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, June 19 (Xinhua) -- The 23rd Southern African
Development Community (SADC) energy ministers conference ended
here Friday, urging its members to ratify SADC's energy protocol
which will allow the formation of a commission to oversee power
issues.
</P>
<P>
Only seven of the 14-member organization, Zimbabwe, Angola,
Botswana, Lesotho, Mauritius, Namibia and Swaziland have ratified
the protocol which has been on the cards since June last year.
</P>
<P>
Countries that still have to ratify the protocol are new
comers Democratic Republic of Congo and Seychelles as well as
South Africa, Malawi, Tanzania, Zambia and Mozambique, the
Zimbabwe News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The ministers noted that in view of the slow ratification of
the energy protocol, the establishment of the SADC Energy
Commission was not progressing as expected because of lack of a
quorum.
</P>
<P>
The ministers also discussed the region's Angolan-based
Petroleum Training Center which has been set up to provide
further training on the energy sector and the upstream and
downstream sectors of the oil industry.

<P>
The network has currently been affected by problems of
reliability particularly blackouts and power failures caused by
oscillations in the operation of the Matimba-Insukamini and
Mozambique-Zimbabwe interconnections.
</P>
<P>
They also discussed and adopted the African Solar Program
(1996-2005).
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the closing session of the conference, Zimbabwe's
Transport and Energy Minister Enos Chikowore stressed the
importance of regional cooperation in the energy sector, saying
that this is crucial to the overall economic growth of the
region.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa to Have Clinical Trial on Anti-AIDS </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, June 19 (Xinhua) -- Clinical trials on the
purported anti-AIDS drug Virodene P058 are set to begin in the
near future, a spokesman for Virodene Pharmaceutical Holdings
said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Larry Heidebrecht said the company would submit a protocol to
the Medicines Control Council (MCC) detailing tests to establish
the absorption rate of the drug from skin patches.
</P>
<P>
He said he expected these "pre-tests", to be performed on
healthy volunteers, would take place in the next few weeks, once
a committee of the MCC approved the protocol.
</P>
<P>
Once the absorption rate tests had been complete, preparations
for a full clinical trial on HIV sufferers would begin, he said.
</P>
<P>
The absorption rate tests would not take long to complete and
would be conducted by a professional laboratory, which would meet
the requirements of the MCC, Heidebrecht said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier research on the drug was condemned by the MCC as being
unprofessional. However, Heidebrecht said a good working
relationship with the MCC had since been established.
</P>
<P>
South African Press Association Friday quoted unidentified
sources as reporting that a consortium of black-owned business
had bought a majority share in the company which owns the rights
to Virodene.

<HEADLINE> Angola: 2,500 Die of AIDS Over Decade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, June 19 (Xinhua) -- More than 2,500 Angolans have died
from AIDS till March, 1998 in the past decade, Deputy Minister of
Health Teresa Cohen said here Friday.
</P>
<P>
Teresa disclosed this to reporters at the airport when she
returned from the conference of health ministers in Africa on the
spreading of AIDS in the region, which was held in Egypt from
June 13 to 17.
</P>
<P>
She said that since the first case of AIDS was diagnosed in
1985, more than 250,000 people have been tested HIV positive and
over 2,500 HIV infected have died from the deadly disease.
</P>
<P>
Ever since 1985, the number of people who were diagnosed HIV
positive has been rising, Teresa noted, adding that the actual
AIDS cases may have exceeded 250,000 because the general
investigation of it was unable to reach every province in the
war-ravaged southern African country.
</P>
<P>
The deputy minister said at the conference, delegates from
African countries held in-depth discussion about the spreading of
AIDS in the continent.
</P>
<P>
The meeting urged each and every African country to adopt an
integrated national anti-AIDS plan in a bid to more effectively
curb the spreading of the killing disease.
</P>
<P>
Teresa considered that as in the case of anti-malaria, it is
not enough to fight AIDS only by efforts of the health authority
in each country.
</P>
<P>
The spreading of AIDS can be contained only with the concerted
efforts of all walks of life in the whole society, said the
deputy minister.

<HEADLINE> Lesotho King Vows to Help Unemployed Miners </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, June 19 (Xinhua) -- Lesotho King Letsie III said
Friday that his country would take new measures to help mine
workers retrenched from South African mines.
</P>
<P>
Officially opening the first session of Lesotho's fifth
parliament in Maseru, Letsie III said Lesotho should look at the
exploitation of its own mineral resources as an alternative for
the retrenched workers.
</P>
<P>
Lesotho, totally surrounded by South Africa, has more than
100,000 people working in South African mines.
</P>
<P>
Letsie said investigations were underway to establish a
large-scale diamond mining venture at Liqhobong in Lesotho's
northeastern highlands.
</P>
<P>
Revenue from the Lesotho Highlands Water Project should also
be used to address poverty, provide jobs and develop
infrastructure, he said.
</P>
<P>
Another possibility in the job creation and poverty
alleviation thrust was expansion of the manufacturing and
agricultural industries.
</P>
<P>
"The pipeline of industrial projects under implementation
includes the first integrated textile and clothing project to be
implemented by the Lesotho National Development Corporation. This
project alone will created about 900 jobs," Letsie said.

<HEADLINE> IPE, Nord Pool Forge European Energy Alliance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 19 (Xinhua) - The International Petroleum Exchange
(IPE) and Nord Pool announced Friday a major co-operation
agreement, enabling users of each market to access the contracts
listed by both exchanges.
</P>
<P>
The alliance of Europe's two largest energy futures exchanges
is motivated by the wish to ensure the best possible service to
members and users of both exchanges.
</P>
<P>
The agreement between the two exchanges is designed to ensure
that companies and individuals operating within the European
energy and futures industries can have the widest possible choice
among exchange-traded products.
</P>
<P>
The IPE and Nord Pool believe that market participants are
interested in the products and contracts that can be traded,
rather than those in the individual exchange that provides them.
</P>
<P>
The IPE is Europe's largest energy futures and options
exchange, offering contracts in Brent Curde, Gas Oil and Natural
Gas.
</P>
<P>
Nord Pool is the world's first multinational power exchange,
with contracts in electricity for the spot and futures of the
power markets in the Nordic countries.
</P>
<P>
IPE chief executive Lynton Jones said: "We are always looking
to cooperate and share expertise with other exchanges. Nord Pool,
with its expertise and leading position in the electricity sector,
is a particularly attractive partner for the IPE."
</P>
<P>
"We hope that this agreement will create new opportunities for
our members, grow our business and ultimately improve the risk
management tools available for the energy industry in general," he
added.

<HEADLINE> PTA Bank Needs Large Sum for Privatization </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, June 19 (Xinhua) -- The Preferential Trade Area (PTA)
Bank needs about 50 billion U.S. Dollars to assist the newly
privatized state-owned firms in member countries.
</P>
<P>
Cassim Chilumpha, the PTA Bank Chairman for Board of Governors
and Malawian Minister of Finance, disclosed this at a press
briefing jointly held with the visiting PTA Bank President Martin
Ogang in Blantyre Thursday, the Malawi News Agency (MANA)
reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The bank intends to acquire the money through borrowing from
international money markets and members, Chilumpha said, adding
that non-members of the bank but within the Common Market for
Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA) grouping are asked to pledge
for their support and guarantees.
</P>
<P>
"As most of the member countries are at the moment trying to
distance themselves from business ventures as evidenced by the
divestiture of state-owned corporations, there is high demand for
investment capital among business entrepreneurs and we feel the
bank is the best organization which can give assistance," said
Chilumpha.
</P>
<P>
He added that South Africa which stands to benefit more from
the privatization process in the region as most of the raw
materials used by the manufacturing industries are procured from
that country "should feel compelled to come to the rescue."
</P>
<P>
"It is very unfair for South Africa to continue enjoying the
business monopoly with countries of COMESA while continuing to be
a non-member," he said, adding that he and the president of the
bank have already briefed the current Chairman of COMESA
President Frederick Chiluba of Zambia to hold talks with
President Nelson Mandela of South Africa on the issue.
</P>
<P>
The minister said that PTA's banks corporate plans which were
presented to Malawian President Bakili Muluzi also seek ways of
encouraging member countries of COMESA to join the PTA Bank.
</P>
<P>
"In so doing, the bank's bargaining power for soliciting loans
for the emerging private sector will be strengthened," said
Chilumpha.
</P>
<P>
In this regard, he observed, members will not be asked to pay
additional money apart from their usual contributions.
</P>
<P>
"What the bank needs is their pledged support," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Our traditional donors like the U.S.A, the United Kingdom,
Japan, India and others will also be asked to come in," said the
minister.
</P>
<P>
On his part, Ogang said that the bank's investment capital is
between four to five hundred million U.S. Dollars.
</P>
<P>
"We hope to reach a capital of five billion U.S. Dollars by
the next millennium," he added.
</P>
<P>
The PTA Bank's overall funding to Malawi's projects and
business loans currently stands at 41 million U.S. Dollars.

<HEADLINE> Cypriot President Sends Letter to Annan on </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, June 19 (Xinhua) -- Cypriot President Glafcos
Clerides has sent a letter to U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan
renewing a proposal on demilitarizing Cyprus, government spokesman
Christos Stylianides said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Clerides sent the letter to the U.N. chief on Thursday with the
aim of reactivating the proposal on demilitarizing the divided
Mediterranean island, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Stylianides declined to divulge the details of the letter, but
adding that the Cypriot president demanded not only Britain, which
is a guarantor power of Cyprus, but also the U.N. Security Council
and the international community to undertake their
responsibilities to restore peace in Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Clerides first raised the demilitarization proposal in December
1993, calling for the disbandment of Greek Cypriot National
Guard and Turkish Cypriot armed forces, as well as the withdrawal
of Turkish forces from northern Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Under the proposal, the weapons should be confiscated and
transferred into the U.N. peacekeeping forces' custody and the
money saved through demilitarization should be deposited into a
fund to benefit the two communities on the island.
</P>
<P>
"The Cyprus government has practically proved with specific
suggestions that it is in favor of reducing the tension, but
unfortunately we have not had any response from the other side,"
the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on Turkish Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz's statement
that he intends to deliberate with Britain on the issue,
Stylianides said "it is absurd that a country which violated the
Treaty of Guarantee and the constitutional order which it should
have defended, to appear now as a guarantor, quote the treaty and
ask another guarantor power to help her reduce the tension."
</P>
<P>
He accused "the Turkish occupation force" of continuing to
violate international law and create all kinds of tension in the
region.
</P>
<P>
Stylianides defended the recent landing of Greek warplanes at
the Paphos military air base, saying it was a scheduled routine
exercise, and part of the joint defense pact between Cyprus and
Greece. He said this should not have been considered a provocation
because defense is Cyprus' sovereign right.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus and Greece signed a joint defense pact in November
1993, under which Greece will provide military assistance if
Cyprus is attacked.
</P>
<P>
Turkey sent six F-16 fighters to the Turkish
Cypriot-controlled northern Cyprus Thursday in retaliation for the
landing of six Greek warplanes at the Paphos base in the Greek
Cypriot-controlled south earlier this week.
</P>
<P>
Five Turkish navy warships also visited Wednesday the ports of
Kyrenia and Famagusta in northern Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Greek Cypriot-controlled
south and the Turkish Cypriot-dominated north since Turkish troops
landed and took over the northern third of the island in 1974
after a failed pro-Athens coup in Nicosia.
</P>
<P>
Greece and Turkey, both North Atlantic Treaty Organization
allies, have long been at odds over this strategic island, where
tension has been running high since January last year when Cyprus
ordered Russian-made anti-aircraft missiles which are scheduled to
be delivered later this year.

<HEADLINE> WHO's New Approach to Fight AIDS </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, June 19 (Xinhua) -- The African regional office of the
World Health Organization (WHO) said Friday it has decided to
adopt a three-pronged initiative to curb the high HIV/AIDS
mortality and morbidity rates in the region.
</P>
<P>
The initiative is mobilization of Africa's political
leadership, including heads of state, in the anti-AIDS campaign
and the institution on more effective intervention strategies, a
statement from the WHO office in Nigeria said.
</P>
<P>
The third strand of the approach is strengthening of
cooperative and collaborative efforts among its partners, the WHO
headquarters and UNAIDS, to make maximum use of available
resources with the view to making greater impact in the overall
containment endeavor.
</P>
<P>
Ebrahim Samba, WHO regional director for Africa, called on all
member states of the WHO Africa region to embrace the new
initiative which will strengthen the capacity of national health
authorities to adopt policies and promote practices that offer
better opportunity for monitoring the disease situation.
</P>
<P>
The statement said that Africa, with only 10 percent of the
world's population, currently had 70 percent of the 20.8 million
global cases of HIV/AIDS.
</P>
<P>
Every country on the continent has, to lesser or larger
degree, reported cases of HIV/AIDS which every day infects 7,500
Africans out of the global total of 16,000 daily infections.
</P>
<P>
"By the end of 1997, close to nine million adults, divided
equally between men and women, and 1.5 million children born with
HIV infection, developed AIDS in the region. Of this, about seven
million children and adults have died," it said.
</P>
<P>
The statement noted that the most vulnerable groups had been
from Africa's productive people between the ago of 15 and 40,
resulting in weakening the productive base, a growing orphan
population, further strains on already under-staffed and
under-funded health services across the continent.
</P>
<P>
Factors accounting for the grim situation, it said, included
the wide practice of unprotected sex, high fertility, high
incidence of sexually transmitted diseases and poor access to
care and information.
</P>
<P>
The organization said that efforts made so far to contain the
pandemic included caring for the victims and launching and
promotion of sensitization campaigns on safe sex through the use
of condoms.

Salim said: "In the course of its discussions with both
parties, the Ethiopian side reiterated its acceptance of the
proposals of the facilitators. The Eritrean side stated clearly
that the facilitation was over."
</P>
<P>
"From this point of view, therefore, the delegation was not
able at this juncture to make headway with respect to the
facilitators recommendations," Salim told the journalists.
</P>
<P>
Salim said that "OAU will nonetheless continue with its
efforts."
</P>
<P>
"The issue is too serious and grave and deserve the continued
attention of the organization," he added.
</P>
<P>
"The OAU delegation continues therefore to be seized with the
matter," Salim said, adding that "it will continue with its
efforts at the levels of ambassadors of the members of the
delegation, ministers and heads of states."
</P>
<P>
He said the OAU delegation will seek the cooperation of both
parties to help them reach a peaceful solution.
</P>
<P>
"The OAU delegation urged both parties to continue exercise
maximum restraint and avoid taking any action which could
escalate the tension and further harm the future relations
between the two countries," Salim said.
</P>
<P>
The OAU high-level delegation was led by current Chairman of
the OAU and President Blaise Compaore of Burkina Faso, and it
includes President Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe, President Pasteur
Bizimungu of Rwanda, Minister of Foreign Affairs of Djibouti
Mohamed Mousa Shehim and OAU Secretary-General Salim.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Lawmaker Urges Demolishing Goldstein </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 19 (Xinhua) -- A senior Israeli opposition
lawmaker on Friday urged the army to demolish the memorials built
for Baruch Goldstein, a Jewish extremist who massacred 29 Muslim
worshippers in 1994.
</P>
<P>
In a letter sent to Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai, Raanan
Cohen, secretary general of the leading opposition Labor Party,
said that the army should take immediate actions to uproot the
memorials for Goldstein built in the Kiryat Arba settlement near
the flashpoint West Bank city of Hebron.
</P>
<P>
Cohen noted that the Knesset (Parliament) already approved a
bill early this month, banning memorials for those who committed
acts of terror. So, he added, it was not necessary for the army to
negotiate with Goldstein's family before carrying out a demolition.
</P>
<P>
The newly-passed bill, popularly known as the Goldstein Law,
went into effect on Thursday. It requested the defense minister to
order the army to demolish the memorials for Goldstein in Kiryat
Arba.
</P>
<P>
Goldstein gunned down 29 Muslim worshippers in early 1994 inside
the Ibrahim Mosque (Tomb of the Patriarchs called by Jews) in
central Hebron before being beaten to death by angry Arabs. He was
later buried in the nearby settlement Kiryat Arba.
</P>
<P>
Jewish extremists have turned the Goldstein grave into a
pilgrim site to express their anti-Arab views. A plaza has been
paved around the gravesite and is decorated with memorial candles,
a cupboard for holy books, a bench and water taps.
</P>
<P>
Israeli peace activists and leftist politicians have been
lobbying the government to relocate Goldstein's tomb in order to
prevent extremists from provoking violent clashes with
Palestinians.

<HEADLINE> IPE And Nord Pool Forge European Energy Alliance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 19 (Xinhua) -- The International Petroleum
Exchange (IPE) and Nord Pool announced Friday a major co-operation
agreement with objective of enabling users of each market to
access the contracts listed by both exchanges.
</P>
<P>
The alliance of Europe's two largest energy futures exchanges
is motivated by the wish to ensure the best possible service to
members and users of both exchanges.
</P>
<P>
The IPE and Nord Pool believe that market participants are
interested essentially in the products and contracts that are
traded, rather than in the individual exchange that provides them.
</P>
<P>
The agreement between the two exchanges is designed to ensure
that companies and individuals operating within the European
energy and futures industries can have the widest possible choice
among exchange traded products.
</P>
<P>
The IPE is Europe's largest energy futures and options
exchange, offering contracts in Brent Curde, Gas Oil and Natural
Gas.
</P>
<P>
Nord Pool is the world's first multinational power exchange,
with contracts in electricity for the spot and futures power
markets in the Nordic countries.
</P>
<P>
Lynton Jones, Chief Executive of the IPE said: "We are always
looking to co-operate and share expertise with other exchanges.
Nord Pool, with its expertise and leading position in the
electricity sector, is a particularly attractive partner for the
IPE."
</P>
<P>
"We hope that this agreement will create new opportunities for
our members, grow our business and ultimately improve the risk
management tools available for the energy industry in general," he
added.

<HEADLINE> Iran Denies Buying Chemical Weapons from Israeli </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, June 19 (Xinhua) -- Iran on Friday dismissed as
"baseless" the Israeli claim that it had bought chemical weapons
parts and technologies from an Israeli arms trader.
</P>
<P>
Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Mahmoud Mohammadi said that
such baseless claims by Israeli officials indicated Israeli
uneasiness over Iran's diplomatic efforts made at the international
arena to curb the danger posed by Israeli nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
Mohammadi made the comments after an Israeli court convicted
Wednesday Nachum Manbar, an Israeli businessman, of illegally
selling biological and chemical weapons parts and knowhow to Iran
for 16 millions U.S. dollars in the past years. Manbar is expected
to be sentenced to life sentence on this charge.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman accused high-ranking Israeli officials of
spreading false rumors against Iran, saying Tehran is seriously
trying to cleanse the Middle East from nuclear arms.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the Israeli accusation coincided with Iran's
successful efforts to pressure Israel on the nuclear issue. He
added that Iran believes security would be restored in the Middle
East region through controlling and curbing Israel's atomic
efforts. He stressed that Israel can not legitimize its
occupation even through its nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
Mohammadi finally urged the International Atomic Energy Agency
to conduct inspection of Israel's nuclear facilities. Israel is
believed to be the only Middle East country that has acquired
nuclear capability.
</P>
<P>
Although western intelligence reports claimed that Israel has
about 200 nuclear warheads, Israel has neither denied nor
confirmed that it has nuclear weapons. Worried that its leading
enemy Iran could acquire nuclear weapons that will threaten its
safety, Israel has been launching an aggressive campaign around the
world to prevent Tehran from obtaining nuclear technologies needed
to build a nuclear bomb.

<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, June 19 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria entered the last 16 in the World
Cup finals after beating Bulgaria 1-0 at Parcs des Princes here on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
AS Monaco midfielder Victor Ikpeba netted the winner in close range
in the 26th minute on a short pass from Daniel Amokachi on the right,
sparking celebration among about 1,000 green-shirted Nigeraian fans in
the nearly full 40,000-seat stadium.
</P>
<P>
Ikpeba almost added another two minutes later when he made a lone
run down the left but his shot glided off the far post.
</P>
<P>
Bulgaria rallied after the break to staged a few threatening
attacks, with their best chance coming in the 87th minute when CSKA
Sofia's striker Emil Kostadinov sent a booming blast only to see the
ball hit the crossbar.
</P>
<P>
Kostadniov's Sofia teammate Hristo Stoichkov also had scoring
opportunity in the 66th minute, shotting in the area but the ball was
saved by keeper Peter Rufai.
</P>
<P>
Scorer Ipkeba said after the game, "I have to say it was a victory
for the whole team. It was a tough game and I should give credit to
all the team."
</P>
<P>
A beaming Nigerian head coach Bora Milutinovic said, "I am very
happy. But the right thing to do now is focusing on the next round."
</P>
<P>
He added, "It was a difficult game. I'm happy with the way we
played in the first half. It had been a very difficult situation for
Bulgaria because they badly needed a win."
</P>
<P>
Asked of the substitution of forwards in the second half,
Milutnovic said the motto of "the best defence is attack" was
applicable to all teams here.
</P>
<P>
"It's not only true for Nigeria, but also for all the teams," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Bulgarian coach Hristo Bonev said, "We played with balance in the
first half until the goal came. That goal really killed us for good."
</P>
<P>
Nigeria, who lost to Italy in the second round in the 1994 World
Cup finals, secured a place in the second round by leading Group D
here with six points.

<P>
MOSCOW, June 19 (Xinhua) -- The European Union has decided to
recall its ambassadors from Minsk, Capital of Belarus, the dean of
the diplomatic corps in Minsk, Bulgarian Ambassador Marko Ganchev,
said on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Ganchev was quoted by the Interfax news agency as saying that
the EU countries' ambassadors will leave Belarus on June 22, when
they receive a written notification about their recall.
</P>
<P>
Ganchev said that the EU decision may be linked with the
incident on Friday in Minsk.
</P>
<P>
The EU ambassadors' cars going to the ambassadorial private
residences in the Drozdy compound were stopped by police three
times for passport checks.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the road to the compound is under repair and the
ambassadors could not reach their premises, Ganchev said.
</P>
<P>
The reason for the EU embassadors' recall is also that
Belarussian President Alexander Lukashenko has canceled his visit
to Switzerland originally slated for June 25, the Interfax said.

<HEADLINE> Security Council Authorizes Iraq to Import </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, June 19 (Xinhua) -- The Security Council of the
United Nations on Friday adopted a resolution which authorized
Iraq to import 300 million U.S. dollars worth of oil equipment and
spare parts.
</P>
<P>
The move aims to upgrade Iraq's capacity of oil export. The
Security Council adopted a resolution in February which allowed
Iraq to export 5.2 billion U.S. dollars worth of oil over every
six months in order to buy food, medicine and other humanitarian
supplies for its people. Without the needed equipment and spare
parts, Iraq cannot reach the new target.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has been under U.N. sanctions since it invaded Kwait in
1990. The Security Council in 1995 adopted Resolution 986 which
allows Iraq to export 2 billion U.S. dollars worth of oil every
six months to ease the humanitarian crisis in the country caused
by the sanctions.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has reiterated that the present stage of oil-for-food
program should be the last one Iraq has to accept. It wants a
complete lifting of the sanctions in six months because it said it
has destroyed all its prohibited weapons.

NANTES, June 19 (Xinhua) -- Croatians vow to beat Japan in their
second Group H match for a berth in the top 16 of the World Cup finals.
</P>
<P>
The two teams will clash here on Saturday and the Croatians are
confident that they have the abilities to beat Japan though
playmaker Zvonimir Boban will possibly miss the match due to calf
muscle injury.
</P>
<P>
"We've got a very strong side," said striker Davor Suker. His
teammate Mario Stanic agreed:"We played a good opening match, but
you will see an even stronger Croatia against Japan."
</P>
<P>
Robert Prosinecki became the first player to score for two
different nations in the finals. He said:"This Croatian team is
full of players who compete in the top leagues in Italy, Spain and
Germany. We should have gone a lot further than the quarter-finals
in Euro 96, but thanks to a bad referee we lost out to Germany."
</P>
<P>
Croatian coach Miroslav Balzevic said before the kickoff of the
World Cup finals that Jamaica and Japan would be no threat to his team.
</P>
<P>
His prediction about Jamaica was right, but the Japanese team
would be a tougher challenge for the Croatians.

<P>
LAGOS, June 19 (Xinhua) -- About 700,000 women in Nigeria
develop breast cancer annually, the News Agency of Nigeria
reported Friday, quoting a surgeon of the country.
</P>
<P>
About 83 percent of the breast cancer patients are even at the
advanced stages of the disease and only about 15 to 20 percent
survived, said Olusola Akute, a consultant surgeon at the
University College Hospital in Ibadan, western Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
At a lecture Thursday to mark the launching of the Breast
Cancer Association of Nigeria, Akute also said that the patients'
survival after diagnosis was only for two years.
</P>
<P>
As the disease could be curable if detected early, he called
on women to always subject their breast to self-examination while
bathing and to consult medical experts if any strange lump or
discharge was noticed in their breasts.
</P>
<P>
Olusola Akute said that ignorance, financial constraints and
fear of surgery are some of the reasons that make the disease to
reach advanced stages before detection.

<HEADLINE> Romania Benefits from Additional EU Support </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, June 19 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) will
increase the financial aid granted to the ten candidate states in
Central and Eastern Europe, the local daily Evenimentul Zilei
(Daily Events) reported Friday quoting sources with the European
Commission(EC).
</P>
<P>
According to the sources, Romania could receive a 300 million
ECU yearly supplement as of January 2000, by implementing programs
such as ISPA, SAPARD, as well as the PHARE program. ISPA is a
program to support environment and transport projects, while
SAPARD is to back farming sector development and rural areas.
</P>
<P>
The ISPA program provides a 85 percent coverage of the
projects, with the rest of the financing to come from national or
local budgets. The ISPA annual funds are forecast to hit 1 billion
ECU between 2000 and 2006U.
</P>
<P>
As for the funds granted to Romania under the PHARE program,
they will hit 150 million ECU in 1999, up from 117 million this
year. 30 percent of the PHARE funds will go to strengthen the
institutions sector, with the rest of the money to be channelled
to investments aimed to support Romania's joining the European
Union.
</P>
<P>
According to EC officials, Romania had met only one of the
three criteria for EU integration so far, namely the political
one, while the supplementation of the funds also depends on the
fulfillment of the other two criteria: an efficient market economy
and legislation in line with the EU countries.

LUANDA, June 19 (Xinhua) -- Preparations started Friday to
establish national authorities in the four cities in central
Angola which had been under the control of the National Union for
the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA).
</P>
<P>
The four cities are Andulo and Nharea in Bie Province, Huambo
and Mungo in Bailundo Province.
</P>
<P>
Media reports here said a joint team comprising United Nations
mission in Angola, representatives of the three observer
countries--the United States, Russia and Portugal, members of
Angolan government and UNITA in the Committee of Angolan Peace
Process as well as other senior government officials, started to
work Friday on the preparations.
</P>
<P>
An agreement on the preparatory work was reached following
difficult negotiations between the Angolan government and the
opposition UNITA with the mediation of U.N. special envoy to
Angola, Blondin Beye.
</P>
<P>
Angolan pace process was stalled for over two months due to
UNITA's refusal to hand over the four cities to the government as
stipulated in the Lusaka Peace Accord signed in 1994.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council adopted a new resolution on June 12
to impose new sanctions on the former rebel UNITA movement, which
will go into force on June 25 if the UNITA fails to make
concessions regarding this issue.

<P>
ANKARA, June 19 (Xinhua) -- Amid tension between Ankara and
Athens in Cyprus, Turkey reiterated Friday its determination to
protect Turkish Cypriots in the northern part of the divided
island.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters in the Aegean city of Izmir, Sukru Sina
Gurel, state minister for European and Cyprus affairs, said that
Turkey has rights and duties to maintain peace in Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
"We have to show Greece that it would be given the necessary
response if it made plans to base its air forces in Cyprus, and
we did so," Gurel said.
</P>
<P>
Turkey's six F-16 fighters flew to northern Cyprus Thursday
morning in response to the landing of four F-16 fighters
and two C-130 transport planes at an air base near the western
coastal town of Paphos on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish warplanes, after an overnight stay, Friday left the
Turkish Cypriot-controlled areas for their base in Turkey.
</P>
<P>
"If anybody is still curious to know what more Turkey can do
to protect the security of the Turkish Cypriots, we can show them
this as well," Gurel said.
</P>
<P>
However, the Turkish official stressed that Turkey has no
intention of escalating the tension on the island of Cyprus and
desires no heated confrontation with Greece.
</P>
<P>
Following Tuesday's landing of Greek warplanes in Cyprus,
Turkish government officials accused Greece of attempting to
Hellenize the divided island, calling it "a provocative action."
</P>
<P>
However, Greek Deputy Foreign Minister Yorgo Papandreou said
in Athens Friday that Turkey escalated the tension on the island
because "it was disappointed with the results of EU's Cardiff
summit."
</P>
<P>
He rejected the suggestions that the current tension would
lead to a war between the two foes.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into Greek Cypriot-dominated south and
Turkish Cypriot-controlled north since 1974 when Turkish troops
landed and took over the northern third of the island in the wake
of an abortive coup seeking union with Greece.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Cypriots unilaterally declared the "Turkish Republic of
Northern Cyprus" in 1983, which is recognized only by Ankara.
</P>
<P>
The latest tension between the arch-rivals of Turkey and
Greece, both members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization,
prompted grave concern among their Western allies.
</P>
<P>
The United States, Britain, France and Germany have called on
the two neighbors to refrain from taking further steps in order
not to make the situation in Cyprus more complicated.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Says Japan Pledges not to Delay Reforms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 19 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
said on Friday that he was not sure whether Japan could implement
major financial reforms before its July parliamentary elections,
but that Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto had pledged not
to delay them.
</P>
<P>
"I'm not in a position to know whether they can do that,"
Clinton told reporters before a meeting with economic advisers.
But he said Hashimoto had pledged in a telephone call on Tuesday
night to act in a "timely fashion."
</P>
<P>
"He said to me they were prepared to issue a statement which
would be clear and specific about what they intended to do in a
timely fashion," Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
But "he did not say whether it would be before or just after
the parliamentary elections, but he said he would not delay
about it," Clinton added.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said he had told Hashimoto that the United States
wants to support the Japanese economic recovery because it has a
great stake in it, "but no short-term efforts would work unless
there was a serious long-term, very comprehensive commitment to
economic reform."
</P>
<P>
The United States took part in a rare intervention to prop up
the sagging yen on Wednesday after Hashimoto promised to act
boldly to revive its economy through reforms.
</P>
<P>
A U.S. official said on Friday in Washington the United States
recognized that Hashimoto may need to do some political
"balancing", and that some elements of the reform package may be
accomplished before the Upper House elections and other after
the elections.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, U.S. Deputy Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers,
on a whirlwind emergency visit to Japan, said on Friday that
Tokyo should pull its act together in the next three weeks --
before the parliamentary elections.
</P>
<P>
And a U.S. official in Tokyo said on Friday that Washington
would be closely watching for a "sense of direction" on the
reforms before July 12 when the elections will be held.

<HEADLINE> Simitis Accuses Turkey of Creating Tension in Aegean Sea </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, June 19 (Xinhua) -- Greek Prime Minister Costas Simitis
Friday accused neighboring Turkey of creating the recent tension
in the Aegean Sea, saying that Greek warplanes's landing on the
divided island republic had nothing to do with the tension.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a cabinet meeting, Simitis said the four Greek F-16
jet fighters and a C-130 transport plane flew Tuesday to Cyprus'
Paphos air base at the invitation of the Cyprus government, the
semi-official Athens News Agency (ANA) reported.
</P>
<P>
While accusing Greece of escalating tension in the Aegean by
landing its warplanes in Cyprus, Turkey in turn sent six F-16
fighters to the Gecitkale air base in northern Cyprus on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into Greek Cypriot-dominated south and
Turkish Cypriot-controlled north since 1974 when Turkish troops
landed and took over the northern third of the island in the wake
of an abortive coup seeking union with Greece.
</P>
<P>
Greek Defense Minister Akis Tsohatzopoulos also stressed Friday
that it was the Cyprus government's inalienable right to grant
permission for brief visits by Greek military planes within the
framework of the training policy followed by Greece and Cyprus as
part of their joint defense doctrine.
</P>
<P>
He warned that it would do Turkey no good to use the Cyprus
problem.
</P>
<P>
The United States has called on both Greece and Turkey to find
ways to reduce the tension in the Aegean. To show its interest in
the peace of the region, the U.S. aircraft carrier "Eisenhower"
will visit Greece.

<HEADLINE> FM: Cyprus not Intended to Create Tension </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, June 19 (Xinhua) -- Defending the recent arrival of
Greek warplanes, Cypriot Foreign Minister Ioannis Kasoulides
said here Friday that Cyprus is intended to neither create tension
nor provoke anyone.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters after a meeting of the Foreign Affairs
Committee at the House of Representatives, Kasoulides said the four
Greek F-16 fighters, which arrived Tuesday in the Greek
Cypriot-controlled south, were only on a training mission
scheduled a long time ago.
</P>
<P>
Kasoulides affirmed that the Cypriot government does not intend
to play games, pledging that no more Greek warplanes will arrive
here this summer before the annual "Nikiforos" military manoeuvre,
due to take place in October.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister accused Turkey of creating an "artificial
tension," adding that "it is advisable that we are aware of the
intentions and respond accordingly."
</P>
<P>
The Greek warplanes' landing in the south has angered Turkey,
who accused Greece of escalating tension on the divided island and
sent Thursday six F-16 fighters to the Turkish Cypriot-controlled
north in retaliation.
</P>
<P>
Tensions have been mounting since early last year when Cyprus
ordered the Russian-made S-300 anti-aircraft missiles, which are
due to be delivered later this year. Turkey has threatened to use
all means to block the deployment of the missiles.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has remained divided since Turkish troops landed and
took over the northern third of the island in 1974 following a
failed pro-Athens coup in Nicosia.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on press reports on the movement of U.S. Carrier
"Eisenhower" toward the Mediterranean Sea, Kasoulides said he has
received assurances from the U.S. Embassy here that the carrier is
not heading to Cyprus as reported earlier.
</P>
<P>
It is heading to the eastern Mediterranean Sea because of the
Kosovo crisis in Yugoslavia, he added.

<P>
BEIRUT, June 19 (Xinhua) -- A member of the pro-Israeli
South Lebanese Army (SLA) and his four-year-old son were killed
Friday in a roadside bombing in south Lebanon, the Orient radio
reported.
</P>
<P>
The blast took place near the car of the killed SLA militiaman
when he was driving with his son along a road at Sabarh village in
the central province of Jezzine, an area policed by the SLA.
</P>
<P>
No party has so far claimed responsibility for the explosion,
the radio said.
</P>
<P>
The latest killings brought to 13 the death toll of SLA members
killed in south Lebanon since the beginning of this year.
</P>
<P>
Israel, with the SLA' backing, has occupied a
1,200-square-kilometer border strip in south Lebanon since 1985
with the claimed aim of protecting its north from cross-border
attacks by Lebanese guerrilla forces.

MOSCOW, June 19 (Xinhua) -- Russia welcomed the United States'
announcement that it intends to normalize the relations with Iran,
the Interfax news agency reported on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Russian Foreign Ministry stated in a report that Russia
always stands for smooth relations with both America and Iran at
various international forums, including Group of Eight Industrial
States.
</P>
<P>
"We believe that a resolute turn for the better in relations
between Washington and Tehran would undoubtedly contribute to a

</P>
<P>
It said that U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright in New

in the region as critical and important, that she spoke of respect
for the Iranian leadership and stressed the need to look into the
future, to overcome mistrust.
</P>
<P>
Such an approach was also reiterated by U.S. President Bill
Clinton on Thursday, the report said.
</P>
<P>
"We trust that Washington's positively charged statements will
be followed by practical steps," it said.

<HEADLINE> San Francisco Extends Smoking Ban to Park Playgrounds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, June 19 (Xinhua) -- A new policy has made San
Francisco one of the few cities in the United States to outlaw
outdoor smoking.
</P>
<P>
The city's Recreation and Park Commission Thursday approved the
policy to ban smoking at public parks and recreation centers
frequented by thousands of children.
</P>
<P>
Officials said that the ban is a way to keep children from
becoming addicted to smoking. The 29 parks where smoking will be
prohibited are small and mainly used by children.
</P>
<P>
The policy will be enforced in two to three weeks, once signs
are posted at playgrounds. Officials said that smoking in public
parks is not illegal, but parks department staff will enforce the
ban by telling people they can't smoke. There is no monetary fine
if someone is caught smoking.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the year, California banned smoking in bars and
nightclubs, smokers' last public indoor refuge. San Francisco's
new measure is the latest attack on outdoor smoking. Other cities
have banned smoking in public lines for movies and buses, or in
public gardens, outdoor courtyards and near children's play areas.

<HEADLINE> Philadelphia to Crack Down on Gun Violence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 19 (Xinhua) -- Philadephia Mayor Edward G.
Rendell and the National Rifle Association (NRA) have agreed to
join efforts to seek federal money for cracking down on gun
violence, according to The Philadelphia Inquirer Friday.
</P>
<P>
Wayne LaPierre, the NRA chief executive officer, said Thursday
that his organization would lobby with the Republican leadership
in Congress to give Philadelphia money to make it a "test city."
</P>
<P>
NRA President Charlton Heston first came up with the idea at
the group's recent convention, asking President Bill Clinton to
designate one city for zero tolerance of gun violence. The idea is
to prove the NRA's view that lack of enforcement of existing gun
laws lies at the root of gun violence, not a lack of gun-control
laws.
</P>
<P>
On NBC-TV's "Meet the Press" Sunday, Heston talked up a program
in Richmond, Virginia, that has cut murders in half, saying, "We
would like to do that in Philadelphia."
</P>
<P>
LaPierre urged Rendell to lobby President Clinton for the
program.
</P>
<P>
"If he'll get the White House, I've got Congress," LaPierre
said.
</P>
<P>
Rendell had continued his efforts to pressure gunmakers to take
steps to curb sales to criminals. On Sunday in Reno, Nevada, at
the annual meeting of the U.S. Conference of Mayors, Rendell is
scheduled to make the case for gun control, such as limiting
buyers to one gun a month.
</P>
<P>
The mayor will discuss the issue before 300 mayors in a forum
with the head of the gunmakers' trade organization.
</P>
<P>
Among major U.S. cities, Philadelphia has the highest
proportion of murders and robberies committed by gun. Last year, a
record 82 percent of 409 homicides were by firearms. By contrast,
the rate in New York was 62 percent.

meetings with Japanese officials on the Japanese reforms, said
Friday that he did not expect the meetings to yield specific new
action plans.
</P>
<P>
"We have said from the very beginning there will not be policy
actions," he told Reuters in an interview.
</P>
<P>
He said the purpose of the meetings between Japanese officials
and the U.S. delegation led by Summers was to discuss the
seriousness of Japan's economic problems and how to nurse its sick
banking system back to health.
</P>
<P>
He said Japan should take concrete steps to fix its ailing
economy, saying, "The key now is for them to act and act
effectively." He said the mountain of bad debts hanging over
Japan's banking system was the most immediate and pressing problem
for Tokyo to tackle.
</P>

<HEADLINE> IMF Approves Second Annual ESAF Loan for Macedonia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 19 (Xinhua) -- The International Monetary Fund
(IMF) Friday announced the approval of the second annual loan
under the Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility (ESAF) for the
former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia in an amount of 24 million
U.S. dollars equivalent.
</P>
<P>
The loan will be used to support the government's economic
program for 1998/99. The loan is available in two equal semiannual
installments, the first of which is available this month.
</P>
<P>
The 1998 program supported by the ESAF aims real GDP growth of
5 percent, end-year inflation of 3 percent, and a current account
deficit of 7.3 percent of GDP. Consistent with these goals, the
overall fiscal deficit in 1998 is projected to increase only
slightly to 0.7 percent of GDP.
</P>
<P>
The ESAF is a concessional IMF facility for assisting member
countries that are undertaking economic reform programs to
strengthen their balance of payments. ESAF loans carry an interest
rate of 0.5 percent a year and are repayable over 10 years with a
5.5 year grace period.
</P>
<P>
Macedonia succeeded the former Socialist Federal Republic of
Yugoslavia to membership in the IMF in December 1992. Its quota is
some 67 million dollars and its outstanding use of IMF credit
totals about 87 million dollars equivalent.

WASHINGTON, June 19 (Xinhua) -- The United States Friday called
an Israeli plan to strengthen its hold on Jerusalem "extremely
provocative."
</P>
<P>
Israel Thursday issued a plan that envisages widening
Jerusalem's boundaries to include land west of the city, in Israel
proper, and creating an "umbrella municipality" with
administrative powers over nearby town in Israel and some West
Bank settlements.
</P>
<P>
"It is extremely provocative" for Israel to take this step at
this sensitive stage in the Middle East peace process, State
Department spokesman James Rubin said at a briefing.
</P>
<P>
He said the future of Jerusalem was "an extremely sensitive and
emotional issue" and Washington wanted no action to be taken that
would preempt "final status" talks between the Israelis and
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
He said Secretary of State Madeleine Albright would discuss the
plan with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in a telephone
call as part of regular contacts between them later Friday.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa's NP Continues to Seek Opposition Coop </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, June 19 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's largest
opposition party, the National Party (NP), would make a fresh
approach to other opposition parties on cooperation in the run-up
to the 1999 general elections, NP leader Marthinus Van Schalkwyk
said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Van Schalkwyk said in an NP meeting that he would write to
other opposition leaders soon on how cooperation would be
possible, and what it could mean for all parties, the
South African Press Association reported.
</P>
<P>
"I and the NP are ready to walk the extra mile to make
cooperation possible."
</P>
<P>
There have been proposals among opposition parties that they
join hands to prevent the ruling African National Congress (ANC)
from securing a two-thirds majority in the election.
</P>
<P>
Van Schalkwyk said his party's federal executives met earlier
Friday to decide how the NP could cooperate with other parties
that broadly shared its values.
</P>
<P>
He said he was disappointed by the reaction of certain other
political parties to earlier NP proposals for cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Another mainly-white-based opposition, the Democratic Party
(DP), ruled out on Sunday the possibility of bilateral political
alliance with the NP. And the Zulu-based biggest black party,
the Inkatha Freedom Party, has also made it clear that it would
go to the polls in its own way.

LA BAULE, France, June 19 (Xinhua) -- England coach Glenn Hoddle
said on Friday that his relationship with David Beckham remained good
although he had not field the Man United midfielder in their opener.
</P>
<P>
"I can understand David Beckham's attitude," Hoddle said. "He is

Alan Shearer, Teddy Sheringham and defender Tony Adams.

"The Romanians are among the best in Europe, twelve of them have
already participated in European Cups with their clubs," he added.
</P>
<P>
He was impressed by the attacking power from Romania's Gheorghe
Hagi of Galatasaray, who "is capable of turning a match at any
moment."
</P>
<P>
Noting the last four encounter between the two teams ended in
draws, Hoddle hoped next Monday's clash in Toulouse would produce
better result.

<P>
UNITED NATIONS, June 19 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Committee on the
Elimination of Discrimination against Women will review the
situation in a number of countries in its forthcoming session, the
U.N. General Assembly announced here Friday.
</P>
<P>
The countries bound to submit their reports on women's status
to the meeting scheduled for June 22-July 10 are New Zealand,
Nigeria, Panama, Peru, the Republic of Korea, Slovakia, South
Africa and Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
"South Africa's report says the country has a high rate of all
forms of violent crime, partly due to the state of conflict and
deprivation from which the country emerged," a U.N. background
release said.
</P>
<P>
"While state violence has decreased since the country's 1994
political transformation, rates of reported rape, sexual abuse of
children and domestic violence are increasing," it said.
</P>
<P>
A total of 161 countries have ratified or acceded to the
Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination
against Women which was adopted by the General Assembly in 1979
and came into force in 1981.
</P>
<P>
Convention parties are committed to submit national reports on
measures taken to comply with their treaty obligations, with an
initial report required within one year of accession, and periodic
reports at least every four years.
</P>
<P>
The committee reviews the reports, evaluates the progress and
formulates recommendations to all states parties on eliminating
discrimination against women.
</P>
<P>
These cover issues such as the impact of structural adjustment
policies, maternity leave, violence against women and the
dissemination of the convention.

BUCHAREST, June 19 (Xinhua) -- It is impossible that Cyprus
becomes entirely a Greek island, as long as there is a Turkish
republic, Turkish Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz said Thursday
afternoon at the end of his two-day visit to Bucharest.
</P>
<P>
Yilmaz said, "Turkey wants a right and just solution to the
situation in Cyprus and is ready to cooperate as before." "Its
first condition will be to give up the idea of transforming Cyprus
into a Greek island and the Turkish community into a minority," he
added.
</P>
<P>
"Greece would be better advised not to try Turkey for size,"
the Turkish prime minister warned, adding that Turkey did not wait
for anybody's mediation.
</P>
<P>
Tension is aggravating recently in Cyprus, as Turkey sent six
F-16 fighters Thursday to the northern part of Cyprus in response
to the landing of four Greek F-16s and two C-130 transport planes
in the southern Cypriot air base Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into Greek Cypriot-dominated south and
Turkish Cypriot-controlled north since 1974 when Turkish troops
landed and took over the northern third of the small island in the
aftermath of a failed coup seeking union with Greece.
</P>
<P>
At present, some 35,000 to 50,000 Turkish troops are stationed
in the northern part of Cyprus with a claimed aim to protect
Turkish Cypriots who unilaterally declared the Turkish Republic of
Northern Cyprus, now recognized only by Ankara.

<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, June 20 (Xinhua) -- Financial officials from 17
countries and regions lauded China for its contribution in helping
maintain financial stability in Asia.
</P>
<P>
The praise is contained in a joint statement compiled by the
financial officials from the Group of Seven (G-7) major
industrialized countries and 10 Asia-Pacific economies in Tokyo
for a one-day meeting.
</P>
<P>
They welcomed China's reiteration of its firm commitment to
maintain the stability of its currency and said the Renminbi has
helped defend the stability of Asian economies and financial
markets.
</P>
<P>
China has been under pressure to devalue their currency as the
Japanese yen and various Asian currencies weaken and threaten to
erode the international competitiveness of Chinese exports.
</P>
<P>
The conference participants also appealed to Japan to correct
its bad loan ridden banking system in order to put its slumping
economy back on the road to recovery.
</P>
<P>
"It is of vital importance to Japan, to the recovery of Asia,
and to the entire world economy that Japan restore its banking
system to health, achieve domestic demand-led growth, and to open
and deregulate its markets," they said.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the participants commended Japan and the United
States for their recent joint action in the currency markets to
buoy the sagging yen.
</P>
<P>
The meeting of the G-7 and the Asia-Pacific economies was
attended by officials from Australia, China, Hong Kong, Indonesia,
Malaysia, New Zealand, the Philippines, Singapore, South Korea and
Thailand.
</P>
<P>
The International Monetary Fund, the World Bank and the Asian
Development Bank also sent delegates to the meeting.
</P>
<P>
The G-7 group consists of Britain, Canada, France, Germany,
Italy, Japan and the United States.

beings to conquer nature.

With a common theme of peace, cooperation and friendship, the
scientists have worked for the cause of peace and development in
the world, the premier said.

<HEADLINE> Bulgarians never Hostile to Serbians: Stoyanov </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SOFIA, June 20 (Xinhua) -- President Petar Stoyanov said
Bulgarians and Serbians live in harmony and are never hostile to
each other, a Yugoslav weekly reported.
</P>
<P>
Stoyanov's comments came as the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization (NATO) is threatening to take military action against
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
"Bulgaria is closely watching the situation in Kosovo, but
Bulgaria does not want to become a political hostage over the
incidents occurring on Yugoslav soil," the exclusive interview by
the Nin weekly quoted Stoyanov as saying.
</P>
<P>
Regarding economic sanctions imposed on Yugoslavia by Western
countries, the president said although Bulgaria favors the
measures taken by the international community, it did not propose
sanctions against Yugoslavia on its own initiative.
</P>
<P>
On the contrary, Stoyanov said such sanctions would inflict
suffering on Bulgaria from the economic losses incurred.
</P>
<P>
Bulgaria is in a dilemma on the Kosovo issue. On the one hand,
Bulgaria fears its "offense" to Yugoslavia will influence the
long-term relations between the two countries. On the other hand,
Bulgaria has no choice but to "approve" of the measures taken by
NATO and the European Union (EU) against Yugoslavia.

<HEADLINE> Iran to Unveil 20 Energy Projects to International Tenders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, June 20 (Xinhua) -- In defiance of the U.S. call for no
big investment in Iran's energy sector, Tehran Saturday invited
international tenders for 20 huge oil and gas projects.
</P>
<P>
The projects, worth 8 billion U.S. dollars, will be tendered
for on a buy-back basis in the current Iranian year starting from
March 21, Tehran radio reported.
</P>
<P>
The U.S., accusing Iran of allegedly supporting terrorism, has
threatened to punish any company which has an investment of more
than 20 million dollars in the energy sector of Iran.
</P>
<P>
But the d'Amato law signed by U.S. President Bill Clinton in
1996 to this effect has met strong opposition in the world.
</P>
<P>
Under pressure particularly from Europe, Clinton announced a
month ago not to impose sanction on three French, Russian and
Malaysian companies for concluding a contract of 2 billion dollars
to develop an Iranian gas field. Iran hailed it as a victory.
</P>
<P>
Announcing the tender plan, Iranian Deputy Oil Minister Mehdi
Husseini was quoted by the radio as saying that the projects will
be implemented in a period of three to five years according to
different contracts with foreign companies.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian official said the projects are aimed at raising
Iran's oil production capacity by 1.4 million barrels per day
(bpd) and annual gas production capacity by 70 million cubic
meters.
</P>
<P>
Iran's oil production capacity stands at 4 million bpd and it
produced 3.925 million bpd at the beginning of this Iranian year.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Regrets U.S. Sanction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, June 20 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan said on Saturday that
it regretted economic sanctions imposed by the United States as a
result of its nuclear blasts, but insisted on safeguarding its
national interests in its own way.
</P>
<P>
Washington slapped a string of sanctions on Pakistan and its
neighbor India on Thursday, including bans on aid and on support
for loans from international financial institutions, but stopped
short of a humanitarian aid embargo.
</P>
<P>
The move came in response to the five underground nuclear tests
conducted on May 11 and 13 by India, in defiance of the great
concern of the international community, and the nuclear tests by
Pakistan late that month.
</P>
<P>
"The U.S. action does not take into account the perilous threat
to our security as a result of the Indian nuclear tests," a
foreign office spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
"We have chosen the path of self-reliance. We will
single-mindedly pursue what we deem is necessary to safeguard our
security, independence and territorial integrity and national
interests," the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan refused any unilateral prescription recommended by the
international community, he said.
</P>
<P>
"No one should expect Pakistan to accept, much less implement,
prescriptions determined by a state or group of states
unilaterally," he noted.

"A uni-dimensional pursuit of the goal of non-proliferation,
especially its application to a nuclearized South Asia, is

<TEXT>

<P>
NANTES, June 20 (Xinhua) -- Croatia have almost qualified for
the round of 16 after beating Japan 1-0 in a Group H match on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
It is Croatia's second straight victory in the World Cup finals.
If Argentina beat or draw with Jamaica at Parc des Princes on
Sunday, then Croatian team will be ensured a place in the last 16.
</P>
<P>
However, the Croatians failed to produce the sparks and
brilliances they had in the match against Jamaica and in the first
half, it was the Japanese team seemed more likely to score.
</P>
<P>
After the lackluster first half which ended 0-0, the Croatians
were more aggressively in the second half. Captain Davor Suker got
a perfect pass from teammate Aljosa Asanovic at the 77th minute and
beat the Japanese goal-keeper Yoshikatsu Kawaguchi with a left-footer.
</P>
<P>
Croatia could have scored earlier in the match but the crossbar
denied the effort of Slaven Bilic.
</P>
<P>
It was the second straight defeat for Japan, who are in
desperate need of a goal in their first ever World Cup. The co-hosts
of the 2002 World Cup finals have been denied any possibilities for
qualifying for the second round though they still have a match to
play.

<HEADLINE> Iran to Unveil 20 Energy Projects to International </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, June 20 (Xinhua) -- In defiance of the U.S. call for no
big investment in Iran's energy sector, Tehran Saturday invited
international tenders for 20 huge oil and gas projects.
</P>
<P>
The projects, worth 8 billion U.S. dollars, will be tendered
for on a buy-back basis in the current Iranian year starting from
March 21, Tehran radio reported.
</P>
<P>
The U.S., accusing Iran of allegedly supporting terrorism, has
threatened to punish any company which has an investment of more
than 20 million dollars in the energy sector of Iran.
</P>
<P>
But the d'Amato law signed by U.S. President Bill Clinton in
1996 to this effect has met strong opposition in the world.
</P>
<P>
Under pressure particularly from Europe, Clinton announced a
month ago not to impose sanction on three French, Russian and
Malaysian companies for concluding a contract of 2 billion dollars
to develop an Iranian gas field. Iran hailed it as a victory.
</P>
<P>
Iranian Deputy Oil Minister Mohammad Nejad-Husseinian was
quoted by the radio as saying that the projects will be
implemented in a period of three to five years according to
different contracts with foreign companies.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian official said the projects are aimed at raising
Iran's oil production capacity by 1.4 million barrels per day
(bpd) and annual gas production capacity by 70 million cubic
meters.
</P>
<P>
Iran's oil production capacity stands at 4 million bpd and it
produced 3.925 million bpd at the beginning of this Iranian year.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Banks Busy Looking For More Customers (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FUZHOU, June 20 (Xinhua) -- Chinese banks, which now face
stiffer competition, are finding themselves 'condescending' to
look for more promising customers and 'marry' profitable
companies, marking a shift to a buyer's market.
</P>
<P>
The Fujian Branch of the Industrial and Commercial Bank of
China recently signed cooperation agreements with ten of the most
prosperous enterprises in Fujian, promising more convenient and
efficient service, in return for agreements to keep the companies'
money in the bank and pay off loans on time.
</P>
<P>
Such practices were not common in the past, because the
Industrial and Commercial bank of China and the three other
state-owned specialized banks -- the Construction Bank of China,
Bank of China, and the Agricultural Bank of China -- were the 'big
four' in banking and cared little about the actual needs of
companies.
</P>
<P>
Under the central planning system, banks loaned money where the
government told them to, a system that was rife with favoritism
and incompetence, resulting in a large number of bad loans and
poor money circulation.
</P>
<P>
But, China's financial reforms called for the 'big four' to
become genuine commercial banks after 1994, putting them on an
equal footing with their new counterparts, like the Shenzhen
Development Bank and China Investment Bank.

<P>
Banks are now responsible for their own profit and loss
statement, with the central bank, the People's Bank of China,
exercising a certain amount of supervision. So now, every bank
tries every means possible to attract promising customers to gain
an edge over the competition.
</P>
<P>
Banks in Beijing are also vying for such big and profitable
clients as the Yanshan Petrochemical Corporation, and enterprises
are choosing banks according to the services provided, local
sources say.
</P>
<P>
In Shanghai, banks are trying to attract individual customers
by providing various financial services from housing consultation
to stock and foreign exchange trading. And, the practice is
growing more popular nationwide, a central bank official says.
</P>
<P>
Economists say that this is the natural result of China's
reforms in finances and enterprises and is good for the
commercialization of state banks and a modern management system.
</P>
<P>
As for the customers themselves, the improved service has
increased the use of financial services and financial awareness,
which drives China's market and economy.

<HEADLINE> Sanctions to Hurt India: U.S. Ambassador </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, June 20 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Ambassador to India Richard
F. Celeste has said that American sanctions would hurt India by
undermining investors' confidence for future projects and might
even lead to withdrawal of existing investment.
</P>
<P>
In an interview to India's magazine "Outlook," which made it
public here Saturday, Celeste said that the real impact was as
much indirect as it was direct. It would make those confronting
important investment decisions think twice about whether this was
where they wanted to put their money now.
</P>
<P>
The United States Thursday announced its detailed sanctions
imposed on India in the wake of its conducting of five successive
underground nuclear tests on May 11 and 13. The sanctions could
hit direct flow of over 2.5 billion U.S. dollars this year to
India.
</P>
<P>
"Apart from India finding it hard to arrange financing for big
projects, there would also be withdrawal of some foreign
institutional investment from the Indian market," Celeste said.
</P>
<P>
Besides, Japanese and European financial institutions would
also put up a go slow sign, he further said.
</P>
<P>
Celeste urged India to sign the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty
(CTBT), saying that India's self-imposed moratorium on testing was
not enough.

FUZHOU, June 20 (Xinhua) -- Heavy rains that lashed the city of
Nanping in east China's Fujian Province from June 12 through 19
killed 12 people, injured 138, and caused serious damage to
infrastructure and housing.

<P>
The storm brought an average of 50 centimeters of rain in the

Floodwaters inundated as many as 33,900 houses, killed 360,000
head of livestock, and destroyed 17,133 hectares of crops. In the
city, 288 factories had to suspend production. Local sources
estimate losses at more then 1.55 billion yuan (about 194 million
U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The city has been hit by torrential rains three times since
early summer, pushing rivers to their limits, and local

JOHANNESBURG, June 20 (Xinhua) -- South African police said
Saturday that it will intensify security measures to curb illegal
hunting in areas near the border with Botswana.
</P>
<P>
This follows the arrest in the last two weeks of three South
Africans hunting illegally at the Kwena Ranch in Botswana, police
said.
</P>
<P>
One of the men, from Pretoria, was charged with illegal hunting on
private land without consent of the owner, illegally importing a
firearm and ammunition, and entering the country illegally. He paid an
admission of guilt of 1200 Rand (about 222 U.S. dollars), and was
repatriated.
</P>
<P>
The other two arrested were from Cape Town and Pretoria, and
charges against them are being investigated.
</P>
<P>
"Prospective hunters trying to hunt across the borders are warned
that both the South Afirca police service and their counterparts from
Botswana are going to reinforce their strategies to catch the
culprits," South African police said.

PARIS, June 20 (Xinhua) -- Brazilians were experimenting with the
new attacking approaches, head coach Mari Zagallo said on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"We've been working on our attacking game involving Leonardo and
Denilson, and tomorrow we'll be doing the the same with Emerson," he
said in their training camp at Ozoir-la-Ferrier outside Paris.
</P>
<P>
He added, "It's essential we work on this part of armoury to make

Sampaio was suspended for one game after collecting two yellow
cards.

<P>
Zagallo said Italy produced excellent performance against Cameron
and Brazil would keep their eyes open on France in the second round.
</P>
<P>
"They've only played against weak sides up until now, so we'll see
how they do once they're in the last sixteen. And losing (Zinedine)
Zidane will be a handicap I imagine."
</P>
<P>
French playmaker Zidane, who had been banned for two games after
being sent off in their 4-0 win over Saudi Arabia on Thursday, will
not play in the last group game against Denmark and in the last

<HEADLINE> Chinese Missile Expert on Commercial Launch Services </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, June 19 (Xinhua) -- The assertion that "China
used U.S. know-how to improve its nuclear ballistic missiles" is
simply untrue, Zhang Xinxia, president of the China Great Wall
Industry Corporation (CGWIC), said at a press conference here
Friday.
</P>
<P>
Zhang, a decision and policy maker for China's commercial
launch services, hoped the people of the United States would
become supportive of the normal, commercial launch services
provided by China for U.S. satellites after learning the facts.
</P>
<P>
It is due to the ignorance of the development of China's Long
March launch vehicles that some Americans think China's 10
successful launches in the past two years were the result of
U.S. assistance, Zhang said.
</P>
<P>
In fact, the Long March launches were successful before 1985
when China first offered commercial services to foreign clients,
said Zhang, a 1968 graduate of the University of Aeronautics and
Astronautics in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
After a LM-3B failed to launch the Intelsat 708 satellite on
February 15, 1996, the Chinese aerospace industry adopted strict
measures to minimize problems, improve the production process and
ensure the quality of its product, Zhang said.
</P>
<P>
It established detailed regulations, including 72 articles for
production management, 28 articles for quality control and five
``go-no-go'' criteria, he noted.
</P>
<P>
"This is what's behind the 10 consecutive successes since
1996," Zhang said.
</P>
<P>
Underestimating the ability of Chinese rocket experts by some
Americans is "illogical and unreasonable," Zhang said.
</P>
<P>
U.S. companies could suffer nearly one billion U.S. dollars in
losses if Washington banned them from continuing their contracts
with the CGWIC, Zhang said, adding that his company would turn to
European partners should such a ban be imposed.
</P>
<P>
Zhang disclosed that his company will launch a French-made
satellite next month.
</P>
<P>
The price tag of the CGWIC is competitive, he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, June 20 (Xinhua) -- The performance of referees in the World
Cup finals are being scored with marks on the scale of 10, a senior
member of the FIFA referees' commitee said here on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Farouk Bouzo of Syria said, "I can generally tell you that the
general (average) mark is 8.1 points."
</P>
<P>
He added that the highest point was 9.0 while the lowest was only
6.4 points but declined to name who was the worst referee.
</P>
<P>
The scores would be used as evidences when the committee selects
the the referees for the second stage competition.
</P>
<P>
But he said the refereeing until now was generally good although he
admitted the referees were not free of mistakes.
</P>
<P>
"The game is game of mistakes. Players committed mistakes and
referees committed mistakes as well," Bouzo added.
</P>
<P>
He denied that the spate of red and yellow cards in Thursday's two
games were due to the earlier remarks made by FIFA President Sepp
Blatter in a news conference.
</P>
<P>
A total of five red cards were flashed in the games between Denmark
and South Africa, and between France and Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
Blatter had said sanction against tackling from behind was not
carried out strictly enough.
</P>
<P>
But Bouzo said, "It was not reaction of the president's conference.
This is to protect the players, to let the game being played in a
clean way."

<HEADLINE> Appliances From Big Chinese Manufacturers Are Good </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 20 (Xinhua) -- Gas ranges that are manufactured
by large or mid-sized Chinese companies are better than those from
small enterprises, according to a recent study by the State
Quality and Technology Supervision Bureau.
</P>
<P>
Of 37 brands of gas ranges examined in the cities of Beijing,
Tianjin and Shanghai, the provinces of Guangdong, Zhejiang,
Jiangsu, Shandong and Hunan, and the Guangxi Autonomous Region, 13
produced by large or mid-sized companies passed quality tests, but
only 66.7 percent of the products from 24 small enterprises passed.
</P>
<P>
Large and mid-sized companies pay more attention to product
quality and can provide better after-sale service, one Bureau
official says.
</P>
<P>
The study showed that the flame of smaller companies' ranges
burned improperly and had a high monoxide content and other
problems. Gas leakage around the valve was also a problem in some
products.
</P>
<P>
The Bureau has already published the results of the study and
asked the quality and technology supervision departments across
the country to stop sales of unqualified gas ranges and to crack
down on the production and selling of shoddy products.

<HEADLINE> hke062027 - Pakistani, Indian PMs to Meet at SAARC Summit in July </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, June 20 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz
Sharif and his Indian counterpart Atal Bihari Vajpayee will have
an important meeting on fringes of the forthcoming SAARC summit in
Colombo, capital of Sri Lanka.
</P>
<P>
During their bilateral meeting at Colombo, the two leaders "can
send their Foreign Secretaries back to the negotiating table,"
said a Foreign Office spokesman at a weekly briefing here Saturday
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The 10th summit meeting of the seven-nation South Asian
Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) is scheduled to be
held in Colombo late July.
</P>
<P>
The Spokesman stressed the urgent need for talks and said there
could not be progress without addressing the core issue of
Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
"We are willing to play ball with India and have no
hesitation," he said.
</P>
<P>
But perhaps India has to realize that a policy of "hegemonism"
and the one which does not address the basic issue cannot promote
relations between the two sides in other areas, he noted.
</P>
<P>
As to the date of the Colombo summit, the spokesman said the
summit is newly proposed to take place from July 29 to 31 instead
of from July 20 to 22.
</P>
<P>
People are pinning high hopes on the Colombo meeting between
Sharif and Vajpayee to revitalize the foreign secretary-level
meeting which broke down in New Delhi last September.
</P>
<P>
Though both India and Pakistan have expressed willingness to
reopen the bilateral dialogue, the two countries are holding
different stances on the resumption of the foreign secretary level
talks.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan insists the talks should be resumed, with a parallel
international engagement, on the basis of the June 23 agreement
reached here by the two sides under which the core-issue of
Kashmir would be discussed.
</P>
<P>
But India, which refuses any third-party intervention, demands
the talks be started in light of proposals it made to Pakistan in
January this year, which Pakistan has rejected as "unrealistic and
unacceptable."

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 20 (Xinhua) -- The State Development Bank signed
a 3.7 billion yuan (about 462 million U.S. dollars) agreement for
loans for a key water control project on the Yellow River here
today.
</P>
<P>
The Wanjiazhai Water Conservation Project on the upper reaches
of the country's second longest river involves water supply, power
supplies and prevention of ice floes.
</P>
<P>
It will be able to provide some 1.2 billion cubic meters of
water each year to three major cities in Shanxi Province and 200
cubic meters to the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. It will also
generate 2.75 billion kw/h of electricity for Shanxi and Inner
Mongolia.
</P>
<P>
The project started in November 1994 and will cost 6.1 billion
yuan when completed. With the SDB loans, the main part of the
project is expected to be completed by the end of this
year.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Detent Between Kuwaiti Parliament, </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, June 20 (Xinhua) -- Crisis between Kuwaiti
government and legislature has been defused thanks to the
mediation by the emir, and "comprehensive contacts and frank
meetings" between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
Both sides have pledged to begin close cooperation to serve the
country and the citizens, but observers here noted that the
reconciliation seems fragile.
</P>
<P>
Relations between the government and the National Assembly
soured earlier this month when the lawmakers led by Hussein
Al-Gallaf decided to grill Interior Minister Sheikh Mohammad
Al-Sabah, holding him responsible for widespread crimes and
corruption in various bodies of his ministry.
</P>
<P>
The government, however, came to the interior minister's
defense, praising him for good service and rejecting the
questioning.
</P>
<P>
The lawmakers were also critical of laws proposed by the
government that would introduce taxes and fees for services that
have been heavily subsidized or offered free of charge for decades.
</P>
<P>
However, Prime Minister Sheikh Saad Al-Sabah said the
parliament's rejection to the laws blocked the economic reforms
aimed at curbing budget deficit with the revenues from the
proposed charge hikes.
</P>
<P>
He then complained that his cabinet could no longer cooperate
with the 50-member legislature.
</P>
<P>
The confrontation raised broad speculation that either the
parliament or the government would be dissolved as a resolution.
</P>
<P>
Two previous Kuwaiti parliaments were dissolved in 1976 and
1986 respectively for severely criticizing the government.
</P>
<P>
To defuse the political crisis, Emir Sheik Jaber Al-Ahmed
Al-Sabah met with the cabinet on June 13, and received main
parliament leaders the following day.
</P>
<P>
The emir stressed "the need to stick to cooperation" between
the parliament and government, and the need to pool all efforts
for the good of the country. A reconciliation deal was reportedly
reached after his intervention.
</P>
<P>
On June 15, cabinet ministers headed by the prime minister met
with parliament members to discuss ways to promote bilateral
relations.
</P>
<P>
However, observers here were not fully confident about the
prospects of the cooperation, saying the parliament's opposition
to the government deficit reduction program was still pending.
</P>
<P>
The parliament has no sign to change its position, and hoped
the government achieve the deficit reduction goal through cutting
its spending and waste instead of raising charges.
</P>
<P>
It argued that raising charges will increase pressure on the
low-income citizens.
</P>
<P>
Besides, political observers said the legislature and the
government have many at adds.
</P>
<P>
Unsatisfied with government's inability in cracking down on
drug trafficking, the National Assembly decided last month to set
up a five-member panel to take charge of the implementation of the
drug laws.
</P>
<P>
But the government reacted strongly to the move, terming it an
intervention in the police work.
</P>
<P>
The Parliament has also complained about government's plans to
purchase out-of-date foreign weaponry and poor medical services.
</P>
<P>
Political analysts here said there are still uncertain factors
ahead in Kuwait's political situation, which can rekindle a crisis
at any time in the future.

<HEADLINE> Protecting Chinese Women Against Violence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 20 (Xinhua) -- China is trying to give women
greater legal protection against social and domestic violence and
to help them guard their rights and interests.
</P>
<P>
Government departments have begun a serious crackdown on rape,
the abduction and selling of women, and on prostitution in the
past five years, according to Li Hui, a judge with the Supreme
People's Court.
</P>
<P>
Li told a seminar today that is a follow-up to the Fourth World
Conference on Women that cases of rape and the selling of women
account for a much smaller portion of the criminal cases than five
years ago, but instances of kidnapping of women and forced
prostitution are on the rise.
</P>
<P>
She said that China has set up 170 special courts at the
grass-roots level to handle cases of divorce, abandonment, and
domestic violence, and to teach women how to use legal means to
protect their rights and interests.
</P>
<P>
Domestic violence has caused bigger concern in the government
than before, but simply punishing the wrong-doers is not the final
solution to the problem, she explained, because it arises from a
number of factors like the unequal economic status of men and
women, sex discrimination, and the low education level of women,
and she suggested that there be measures to improve women's and
men's awareness of the law. The conception of family violence
should be more clearly defined by the law and judges who handle
cases of family violence should be given special training, she
said.
</P>
<P>
According to a recent survey by the All-China Women's
Federation (ACWF), 0.9 percent of Chinese women face the threat of
family violence, while 8.2 percent have been the victims of family
violence at least once.
</P>
<P>
The ACWF is planning organizations that can provide education
on family violence and the law, and can help victims of family
violence receive physical and mental health care, and provide them
with legal services, says Xu Weihua, an official with ACWF's Legal
Department.

<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, June 20 (Xinhua) -- French coach Aime Jacquet said Friday
night that the two-game ban on playmaker Zinedine Zidane had been too
severe.
</P>
<P>
"The punishment was much too severe. With these kinds of sanctions,
the fact that palymakers like him take such a beating is not
sufficiently taken into account," said Jacquet.
</P>
<P>
He added, "The referee's decision was a little hasty. A yellow card
would have been enough. It is also important to underline that the
Saudi captain was out to provoke Zidane."
</P>
<P>
French captain Didier Deschamps said there was no excuse for the
flare-up of Zidane's fiery temper, which was due to his "Mediterranean
character that he could not alway control."
</P>
<P>
Deschamps said, "In the heat of the moment I lost my temper with
him. After watching the replay, I still think that the decision was on
the harsh side even though I don't excuse what he did."
</P>
<P>
Zidane, a key member of the French team that has reached the second
stage, will not play their next game against Denmark on June 24 in
Lyon and their first game in the second stage.

KAMPALA, June 20 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni
said that his government is committed to fighting corruption and
that nobody is beyond the reach of the law when proved corrupt.
</P>
<P>
The Ugandan president made the determination while meeting
with local and international human rights activists here Friday.
</P>
<P>
Saturday's Monitor daily quoted Museveni as saying:" There is
nobody who is untouchable when it comes to corruption, there is
nobody whom one can say that he is so politically strong that we
can't deal with him when proved corrupt."
</P>
<P>
He said, however, he faces technical problems to unearth and
eliminate corruption.
</P>
<P>
"For us we don't have any political problem in fighting
corruption but we lack investigative capacity. Our institutions
lack adequate auditors, accountants and prosecutors to give us
evidence about the corrupt," he noted.
</P>
<P>
He called on the human rights organizations to help detect and
investigate the corruption cases across the country.
</P>
<P>
A human rights activist said that rampant corruption in this
east African country has caused cynicism, scepticism and
discontent in the system and ultimately frustrated its work.

<HEADLINE> Africa Still Stranded with 2 Million Refugees </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, June 20 (Xinhua) - Some two million African
refugees are now still waiting for returning home though a great
progress has been achieved over the past year in this field, a
senior UN official said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Sadako Ogata, the United Nations High Commissioner for
Refugees said, in a statement released here to mark the 24th
Africa Refugee Day, that nearly two million Rwandan refugees have
recently returned from exile, as a result of the effort by many
states.
</P>
<P>
The repatriation of Malian refugees from Mauritania and
Burkina Faso has been completed with only a few thousand exiles
from Mali remaining in Algeria and the Niger, she said.
</P>
<P>
"We are very near to bringing this complex, three-year
operation to a close," the UN official said.
</P>
<P>
The High Commission also said that late 1997 saw the end of
UNHCR's program for Togolese refugees.
</P>
<P>
However, Sadako said that as the Rwanda is struggling to
re-integrate the refugees, there are still many Rwandans outside
their country.
</P>
<P>
She said that Tanzania has helped to ferry refugees home
across Lake Tanganyika to the Democratic Republic of Congo, but
it continues to host a quarter of a million assisted Burundi
refugees.
</P>
<P>
Sadako outlined one of the UNHCR's top priorities for this
year as the return of nearly half a million Liberians.
</P>
<P>
"It is my hope that stability will also finally take root this
year in Angola, allowing the momentum of repatriation to
accelerate so that around 250,000 refugees will be able to return
from neighboring countries," she said.
</P>
<P>
She said that while there are still over 400,000 Somali
refugees outside their country on the east side of the continent,
more than 500,000 Sierra Leoneans are exiled in Guinea and
Liberia on the west.
</P>
<P>
Sadako said that the process of building peace in Africa can
only succeed if it is rooted in a sense of solidarity among all
its members including refugees and returnees.
</P>
<P>
"UNHCR has worked in Africa for 40 years and we know that
solidarity is easy to talk about but difficult to put into
practice," she said.
</P>
<P>
Sadako said that she is still struck by the foresight of the
authors of the OAU Refugee Convention which set June 20 as the
Africa Refugee Day.

referred to by some as China's Romeo and Juliet, will be performed
at New York's Lincoln Center.
</P>
<P>
These are a few of the cultural exchanges between China and the
U.S. that are developing in many ways, according to China's
Minister of Culture Sun Jiazheng, who told Xinhua that, during
President Jiang's visit to Washington last year, the two heads of
state agreed to establish a kind of constructive strategic
partnership for the 21st century between the two countries that
includes cultural exchanges.
</P>
<P>
During President Clinton's visit, a cultural contact plan for
the 1998-2001 period has been scheduled, the signing of which will
undoubtedly usher in a new era of cultural exchanges, Sun says.
</P>
<P>
However, he says, from the perspective of cultural exchanges
like films, radio, television, publishing and the performing arts,
China gets more than it exports, which is why the Chinese know
more about the U.S. than the Americans know about China. Even
people in remote villages receive prompt information on the U.S.,
but, the U.S. media seldom give objective coverage about China,
resulting in a lack of comprehensive and objective understanding
of China.
</P>
<P>
Of the 50 or 60 foreign films shown in Chinese cinemas each
year, some 15 to 20 come from the U.S. as do a large number of the
foreign television programs.
</P>
<P>
But, China will stick to its reforms and opening up and the
Chinese government welcomes the introduction of all culture that
is beneficial to the healthy development of the national economy
and culture, he said.

<HEADLINE> Israel Rejects U.S. Flak of Greater Jerusalem Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 20 (Xinhua) -- Facing strong criticism by the
United States of its plan to expand Jerusalem, Israel quickly
defended itself by saying the plan would not change the status of
the West Bank, Israel Radio reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
David Bar-Illan, media advisor to Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu, was trying to fend off the U.S. censure. He was quoted
by the radio as saying Israel has no intention to annex
Palestinian territories.
</P>
<P>
U.S. State Department spokesman James Rubin Friday dismissed
the Israeli plan, endorsed by Netanyahu Thursday with the aim of
strengthening the Jewish state's hold on the holy city in dispute,
as "extremely provocative."
</P>
<P>
He said it is "hard to understand" why Israel has taken such a
step at "a sensitive time" in the negotiations with Palestinians
over the second pullback from the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Rubin said Secretary of State Madeleine Albright had conveyed
her displeasure to Netanyahu in a telephone call. She had also
called to a dozen leaders of American Jewish communities to
express her annoyance over the plan and, according to one of the
leaders, had asked the Israeli cabinet to reconsider it.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu formally received the controversial plan Thursday
from a committee which comprises of directors-general of the
Prime Minister's Office, the interior minister, and members from
the Jerusalem Municipality and Jerusalem Development. At the
ceremony, he reiterated that Jerusalem is the sovereign capital of
Israel, and that Israel, and Israel alone, has the sovereignty
over the city.
</P>
<P>
According to the 12-point plan, a ring road around east
Jerusalem will be constructed, a tunnel will be built under Mount
Scopus to connect with Maaleh Adumim, one of the biggest Jewish
settlements in east Jerusalem. Meanwhile, measures will be taken
to boost investment in the city and attract more Jews there.
</P>
<P>
The plan also caused resentment among residents in communities
west of the Jerusalem, who have objected to the annexing of their
land for expanding Jerusalem westward.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu described the plan as "a basic change in Jerusalem's
status which will be remembered as a turning point."
</P>
<P>
"The first thing we are doing is to link Greater Jerusalem," he
said, referring to the planned tunnel and ring road. "The second
thing is strengthing the Jewish majority in Jerusalem."
</P>
<P>
The status of Jerusalem is one of the most sensitive and
contentious issues in Israeli-Palestinian negotiations. For its
emotional and potentially explosive significance, negotiations
over Jerusalem have been postponed to the permanent status talks.
</P>
<P>
Before the talks take place, concerned sides are required to
refrain from taking unilateral actions to change the status,
demographic composition or character of the city.
</P>
<P>
The expansion plan came at a time when tensions were flaring up
between Israel and the Palestinians over increasing Jewish
settlement activities in the Arab East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Palestinians have also complained that Israel has intensified
its work of demolishing Palestinian houses, which the Israeli side
said were built without permits.
</P>
<P>
The plan, to be funded under the 1999 Israeli state budget,
will be presented to the cabinet Sunday for discussion.
"Jerusalem will stand at the top of our priorities in the budget
framework," Finance Minister Ya'acov Neeman has been quoted by the
Israeli media as saying.

<HEADLINE> Gauteng Province Remains S. Africa's Crime </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, June 20 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's Gauteng province,
where Johannesburg and Pretoria are located, remains the crime capital
of South Africa, heading the other provinces in almost all serious
crimes, The Citizen daily reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Last year, more than half of all motor vehicle and motorcycle
thefts in South Africa, as well as more than half of all car
hijackings, occurred in Gauteng Province, the richest province in
the country, said the report.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted Safety and Security Minister Sydney Mufamadi as
saying Friday that only 14 percent of the motor hijackings or
thefts were solved.
</P>
<P>
Mufamadi was answering questions in parliament by opposition
Democratic Party member, Douglas Gibson.
</P>
<P>
The minister said Gauteng recorded 5,645 cases of murder last year,
as compared with 6,200 in Kwazulu-Natal and 4,219 in Eastern Cape.
</P>
<P>
However, in culpable homicide, Gauteng led with 3,071 cases, over
Kwazulu-Natal with 2,611 and Eastern Cape with 1,606.
</P>
<P>
This means that 23 percent of all criminal deaths in 1997 took
place in Gauteng.
</P>
<P>
Besides, 20.5 percent of assaults, 24 percent of rapes or attempted
rapes, and 37 percent of robberies in the country occurred in Gauteng
last year.
</P>
<P>
Central Johannesburg and Johannesburg's red-light district of
Hillbrow continue to head the crime figures for the 20 police stations
in the central Gauteng area, according to Mufamadi.

<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, June 20 (Xinhua) -- Nepali Home Secretary Padam
Prasad Pokharel has discussed in detail with his Indian
counterpart the criminal activities along the border between the
two countries, the Nepali Home Ministry said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The ministry said in a press release that they expressed their
views on how to effectively control such illegal activities along
the 1,750-kilometre open border.
</P>
<P>
Pokharel paid a three-day visit to India on June 17-19 at the
invitation of the Indian government.
</P>
<P>
During his stay in New Delhi, Pokharel also held discussions
with Indian home minister and foreign secretary, the Nepali
ministry said, adding that other senior officials from Indian
Ministries of Home Affairs, External Affairs and Law and Justice
and security bodies were also present on the occasion.
</P>
<P>
The ministry did not disclose details of the discussions, but
it said that besides border criminal activities, border dispute
with India is also a major concern of Nepal.
</P>
<P>
In recent months, the Nepali side has been pressing India to
stop and return the Nepali territory encroached upon. In
particular, it demands the removal of Indian army from Kalapani in
far-western Nepal, which borders Nepal, India and China.

<HEADLINE> APEC Senior Officials Meeting Ends in Malaysia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUCHING (Malaysia), June 20 (Xinhua) -- The three-day second
Senior Officials Meeting (SOM II) of the Asia-Pacific Economic
Cooperation (APEC) ended here Saturday without agreement on Early
Voluntary Sectoral Liberalization (EVSL).
</P>
<P>
SOM II failed to reach agreement mainly due to some different
views on the flexibility of the EVSL, Executive Director of the
APEC Secretariat and Singapore Ambassador Noor Adlan said while
briefing reporters on the meeting.
</P>
<P>
The flexibility is a decision point that will be left to APEC
ministers responsible for trade to take decision, he said.
</P>
<P>
He described the EVSL as "the most important agenda and the key
issue" at the SOM meeting which he said will present a status
report on the issue to the APEC trade ministers who will meet here
on June 22 and 23.
</P>
<P>
Adlan did not say which APEC members are demanding flexibility.
</P>
<P>
He said Chile and Mexico are out of the EVSL as they are on
another track for trade liberalization.
</P>
<P>
However, he said the SOM meeting agreed on other agendas such
as Economic and Technical Cooperation (ECOTECH) as well as on
issues relating to the APEC management process including
business/private sector participation process.
</P>
<P>
It also studied a wide range of issues on electronic commerce
and reached agreement on that.
</P>
<P>
The SOM meeting was attended by all the APEC members --
Australia; Brunei; Canada; China; Chinese Taipei; Chile; Hong
Kong, China; Indonesia; Japan; South Korea; Malaysia; Mexico; New
Zealand; Papua New Guinea; the Philippines; Singapore; Thailand
and the United States.
</P>
<P>
APEC members-to-be -- Peru, Russia and Vietnam -- also attended

JOHANNESBURG, June 20 (Xinhua) -- Former South African
president P W Botha is to marry his new love, Cape Town legal
secretary Barbara Robertson, South African Press Association
Sutarday quoted a local Afrikaans newspaper, Die Burger, as
saying.
</P>
<P>
The marriage is scheduled for next week, almost exactly a year
after Botha buried his wife Elize, said the report.
</P>
<P>
The marriage will take place in Botha's home in Wilderness,
Western Cape, and only about 14 guests, most of them close
family, will attend.
</P>
<P>
Botha, 82, broke off his engagement to blonde Reinette te
Water Naude a few weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
He met Robertson at the launch last year of his autobiography,
where she was introduced to him by one of his daughters, Rozanne
Visagie.
</P>
<P>
Botha's trial for snubbing the Truth and Reconciliation
Commission subpoena was postponed Monday until August 17. A
verdict is expected on the following day.
</P>
<P>
If convicted, Botha faces a sentence of up to two years or a
fine of up to 20,000 Rand (about 3,700 U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Botha was put on trial after ignoring repeatedly a subpoena of
the TRC for hearings on the now defunct State Security Council,
which he chaired in the 1980s. The TRC was investigating alleged
gross human rights violations of the council.

<P>
HONG KONG, June 20 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong's Television Broadcast
Limited (TVB) has been fined 100,000 HK dollars (12,800 U.S.
dollars) for its recent broadcasting of a program featuring an
interview with an alleged Macao gang leader.
</P>
<P>
It was believed to be the third highest fine levied by Hong
Kong's Broadcasting Authority, with the maximum fine for such an
offense being 250,000 UK dollars (32,000 U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The episode of Focus on Focus, broadcast on May 1 on TVB Jade,
featured Wan Kuok-koi, also known as "Broken Tooth", the alleged
leader of Macao's 14K triad society, who talked about his wealth
and success in gambling. The broadcast was followed by about 300
complaints from viewers.
</P>
<P>
"The glorification of triad members is totally objectionable
and can't be broadcast at this time," said Authority chairman
Norman Leung Nai-pang.
</P>
<P>
It sent a very wrong message that one can get rich through
triad activities, which would have a bad influence on youngsters,
he said.

<HEADLINE> UNHCR Stresses Refugee Problem in Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, June 20 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations High Commission for
Refugees (UNHCR) has reiterated the need for African leaders to seek
solutions to the refugee problem in the continent.
</P>
<P>
The organization urged African leaders to replace the language of
confrontation with that of consultation in resolving their differences
to stem the scourge of refugee problems currently plaguing Africa.
</P>
<P>
This is the highlight of a statement issued by UNHCR Representative
in Nigeria, Guebre-Christos, on the occasion of African Refugees' Day
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The statement lamented the spate of refugee crises in Africa,
saying that instead of abating, it is increasing at an alarming rate.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics, 18 million people have been
uprooted from their homes worldwide. Of the figure, six million can be
found in Africa. One out of every 35 Africans is either a refugee or
displaced person.
</P>
<P>
Citing the need to hold peaceful talks in resolving issues, the
UNHCR official said, most refugee problems would have either been
prevented or solved, if leaders and aggrieved parties took pains
to mobilize all peaceful resources to resolve the crises.
</P>
<P>
Although efforts have been made to resettle and take care of
refugees in Rwanda, Tanzania, Algeria, Mali and Liberia, UNHCR is
beset with a myriad of problems hindering its operation, the
Guebre-Christos said.
</P>
<P>
"A stable peace in the region will in part depend on their
(refugees) successful return and reintegration," she said.

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 20 (Xinhua) -- More than 7,000 people pledged
here Saturday to make Hong Kong a healthy city at the launching
ceremony of a three-year campaign called "Healthy Living Into the
21st Century."
</P>
<P>
"The promotion of people's awareness of personal and public
hygiene will enable Hong Kong to maintain its international status
as a healthy and clean cosmopolitan city," Chief Executive of the
Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) Tung Chee Hwa said
while officiating at the kick-off ceremony at the Hong Kong
Coliseum.
</P>
<P>
He noted that a series of incidents of food hygiene in recent
months had underlined the need to upgrade Hong Kong's public
health and environmental hygiene.
</P>
<P>
To encourage people of all ages and from different sectors to
take part in the campaign, the SAR government will launch a series
of promotion and education activities, such as broadcasting a
50-episode "One Minute Health" program on the local radio,
cleaning the beaches and training student environmental protection
ambassadors.
</P>
<P>
The government will also accord top priority to prosecution
actions against those who break the law. "The relevant authorities
will deploy staff to take enforcement action against littering,
spitting, smoking in no-smoking areas and the operation of
unlicensed food premises," Tung added.
</P>
<P>
A steering committee on healthy living, chaired by
Administrative Secretary Anson Chan, will be responsible for the

<P>
In their editorials Saturday, the two papers said U.S.
officials must know the wall of mistrust cannot come down with
mere words, it needs genuine practical moves, such as lifting
sanctions against Tehran and releasing the Iranian assests frozen
in American banks for 19 years.
</P>
<P>
The calls came in reaction to ground-breaking statements made
by President Bill Clinton and Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright, saying that Washington wanted genuine reconciliation
with Tehran.
</P>
<P>
The pro-moderate Iran News noted the recent Washington
statements "are considerably different from the previous ones,"
but added that as long as the U.S. officials stress on words, not
actions, it is unlikely to solve the outstanding problems between
the two countries.
</P>
<P>
It also blamed Clinton for repeating the allegations such as
Iran's support for terrorism, efforts to seek weapons of mass
destruction and opposition to the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the conservative daily Tehran Times stressed the
importance of U.S. actions in warming bonds with Tehran.
</P>
<P>
The paper blamed the U.S. administration for submitting to the
Israeli lobby in the congress.
</P>
<P>
It said that both Washington and Tehran should "be careful as
pro-Zionist Republicans will do their best to poison the political
climate which now exists between Islamic Iran and world's oldest
democracy, the United States."
</P>
<P>
It also stressed that Tehran-Washington relations should be
based on mutual respect and non-interference in each other's
internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
Kicking the ball back to the U.S. court, Iran's Foreign
Minister Kamal Kharrazi has reiterated Tehran's consistent stand
that the U.S. must change its "hostile policies" towards Iran
before a possible normalization in ties.
</P>
<P>
But according to Iran's constitution, Iranian supreme leader
Ayatollah Ali Khamenei is the ultimate authority to make final
decision on Tehran's relations with Washington, the paper said.

<HEADLINE> ASEAN, FOC Happy With Poll Preparation in Cambodia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, June 20 (Xinhua) -- The Association of Southeast Asian
Nations (ASEAN) troika and the Friends of Cambodia (FOC) are
satisfied with the preparations for the Cambodian elections
scheduled for July 26, the Troika's top diplomats said here
Saturday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
They expressed the satisfaction at a press conference right
after a meeting between the ASEAN Troika, consisting of Thailand,
Indonesia and the Philippines, and the Friends of Cambodia, namely
Australia, Canada, the United States, the European Union and
Japan.
</P>
<P>
Philippine Foreign Secretary Domingo Siazon read a troika
statement, saying the three countries support the important role
of Cambodian King Norodom Sihanouk in helping restore the
country's political stability, especially his call Wednesday on
the Cambodian people to exercise their right to vote without fear.
</P>
<P>
So far, about 90 percent of the eligible voters have registered
to take part in polling, sources said.
</P>
<P>
The troika statement also underscored the value of
international observation of the electoral process under U.N.
coordination to achieve free, fair and credible elections, saying
the ASEAN will send its own observers.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that Indonesia and Thailand plan to send eight
observers while the Philippines is expected to send between 10 and
12.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Thai Foreign Minister Surin Pitsuwan said his
country had appealed to the participants of the meeting to
sympathize with "the burden Thailand is now shouldering."
</P>
<P>
He referred to the 55,000 displaced Cambodians on Thai soil,
particularly on the eastern border.
</P>
<P>
"Thailand is very hopeful that (these people) would be able to
return as soon as possible," he said.
</P>
<P>
In a separate communique, the Friends of Cambodia urged the
Cambodian government to ensure that all political parties be given
equitable access to the media.
</P>
<P>
They also "strongly encouraged" the Cambodian government to
take measures to ensure the integrity and secrecy of voting and
the ballot count, as well as the participation and safety of
national and international observers.

<HEADLINE> Interest Rates Hike Hampers S. African Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, June 20 (Xinhua) -- The Standard Bank, the
second biggest bank in South Africa, announced Friday night that
it had lifted its interest rate by one percentage point, from
20.25 percent to 21.25 percent.
</P>
<P>
The announcement was made following Absa, the biggest
commercial bank in the country, raised its lending rate and
mortagage lending rates by two percentage points 10 days ago.
</P>
<P>
By June 15, the First National Bank and two other major banks
in South Africa had followed suit.
</P>
<P>
Standard Bank's move came a few hours after South Africa's
Reserve Bank allowed its lending rates to the banks to climb to
the highest level in 13 years.
</P>
<P>
The key repurchase or "repo" rate shot up nearly four
percentage points to nearly 20.4 percent as the Reserve Bank
tried to soothe turbulent financial market where the Rand, South
Africa's national currency, had slid to a new low of 5.52 to the
U.S. dollar. At the start of this week, one U.S.Dollar equals
about 5.30 Rand.
</P>
<P>
The Rand closed Friday night at 5.47 to the Dollar and 9.16 to
the British Pound. It has lost more than 13 percent against the
Dollar this year, as investors, nervous about fall-out from
Asia's economic crisis, have fled emerging markets, including
South Africa, to take refuge in the Dollar.
</P>
<P>
Unless stabilty returns to financial markets quickly, other
banks will be forced to increase their interest rates, economists
said, predicting that the higher cost of borrowing will be a
severe set-back for chances of South African economic growth.
</P>
<P>
Economists here are reportedly revising their growth hopes for
the full year down to a range between one percent and 1.5
percent.

<HEADLINE> Germany Need the Win Over Yugoslavia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
PARIS, June 20 (Xinhua) -- Germany need a win over Yugoslavia at
Lens on Sunday to boost their World Cup hopes.
</P>
<P>
In their previous World Cup triumphs, Germany all beat
Yugoslavia before winning the World Cup. So a victory at Lens would
be a blessing for the German team at the France'98 World Cup finals.
</P>
<P>
Though German coach Berti Vogts is still pondering his team's
line-up against Yugoslavia, one thing is clear:the German team will
continue to play their pyhsical game despite the rash of red cards
handed out in the last two days.
</P>
<P>
"We will continue to play in our own style." Vogts said.
</P>
<P>
Vogts has an injury worry about Jens Jeremies who picked up an
ankle injury in the 2-0 defeat of the United States on Monday. But
Thomas Hassler is recovering from his ankle injury and that is a
good news for the German team.
</P>
<P>
It's not clear if Vogts would let World Cup veteran Lothar Matthaus
play in the match. If Matthaus has the chance to play, he will be the
first player in history to play 22 games in World Cup finals.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Yugoslavia's Sinisa Mihajlovic said he believed that
the match against Germany would be easier than against Iran.
</P>
<P>
"Without doubt Germany are one of the best teams in the World
Cup, but their qualities are not so technical as in the past," said
Mihajlovic, "They have not so many individuals but they are still a
good team."
</P>
<P>
Yugoslav coach Slobodan Stantrac would not reveal his line-up in
the match against Germany:"Before the World Cup I said each line-up
would be picked according to each opponent and that is still the case."

<HEADLINE> School Children in Pursuit of Brandname Worry Experts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 20 (Xinhua) -- A signed article carried by
today's Guangming Daily voices anxiety over the growing trend
in brandname-conscious small children in China.
</P>
<P>
By chance, the author of the article met a three-grade school
girl who could recite a dozen Chinese and foreign brandname
products she care for so much or happen to know.
</P>
<P>
This led the author to conduct an investigative survey in the
Hanzhong St. Primary School in Nanjing, east China's Jiangsu
Province. In one class, all the pupils were fond of writing down a
dozen brandnames, whereas in another class, no pupil surveyed said
"no" to the querry "who so far has not used a brandname commodity."
</P>
<P>
This outcome of the survey surprised not only the author, the
teachers, but some department store salespeople who found to know
far fewer brandnames themselves than primary school children,
according to the article.
</P>
<P>
Fu Hong, a children psychologist of the Nanjing Normal
University was quoted as saying that the phenomenon is mainly
attributed to the influence of advertising.
</P>
<P>
The rapid increase in ads of children's goods, he noted, can
easily arouse the children's curiosity and exert a subtle,
negative impact on their consuming behavior.
</P>
<P>
The parents who tend to spoil their only child and who
can hardly resist the temptation of the brand name products
themselves pose another problem.
</P>
<P>
Children's strong desire for brandnames is worrisome since it
engenders the sense of vanity and detrimentally affects their
psychology, Fu said.

<HEADLINE> First Egyptian Oil Company Offered for Sale </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, June 20 (Xinhua) -- Egypt opened up its oil sector to
private investors for the first time Friday, offering them a 35
percent stake in the capital of a newly-established crude refining
and processing firm, the Egyptian Mail reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
A total of 35.7 million shares of Misr Petroleum Processing
Company were offered for Egyptian and foreign investors, with each
share at 10 pounds (about 2.9 U.S. dollars), the paper said.
</P>
<P>
This was the first public offering in oil sector in Egypt,
according to the paper. It marks a U-turn in Egypt's privatization
policy.
</P>
<P>
Oil Minister Hamdi Al-Banbi had insisted that the state would
not privatize Egypt's oil refineries and firms because they
perform a "strategic, national role."
</P>
<P>
Since it launched privatization program in earnest in 1996,
Egyptian government has sold majority stakes in scores of firms,
forgone its interest in mobile telephone network and offered
infrastructure and utilities projects to private investors.
</P>
<P>
Egypt sells 10 companies every three months and 105 out of 314
state-owned companies have been offered for sale under the
privatization program, according to the Ministry of the Public
Enterprise.

WASHINGTON, June 19 (Xinhua) -- Maurice Greence, world champion

</P>
<P>
Greene's mark tied the world best set by Canada's Donovan
Bailey in the 1996 Olympics. However, a tail-wind of 3.3 meters

Greene ran even faster on May 31 at Eugene, clocking 9.79 with
a strong wind behind him at the Prefontaine Classic meet.
</P>
<P>
Three other runners - Obadele Thompson, Carl Lewis and Andre
Cason, all Americans, have run under 9.84, all wind-aided.
</P>
<P>
Greene, 23, has a personal best 9.86. He said:"It was terrible,
technically terrible. My mind wasn't in it. I was not focused. My
mind was wandering around."
</P>
<P>
Marion Jones, the women's 100-meter world champion, also ran a

<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, June 20 (Xinhua) -- Students and faculty members of the
institutions of higher learning in this capital of northwestern
Shaanxi province, either Chinese or foreign, appreciate President
Bill Clinton's imminent China trip, and expressed their optimism
on the prospects of Sino-US relations.
</P>
<P>
Xi'an will be the first stop of Clinton's visit, the first
state visit by a US president to China in a decade.
</P>
<P>
Chen Yu, a graduate student in the Business School of Xi'an
Jiaotong University, said President Jiang Zemin's visit to the US
last fall opened up a new page for Sino-Us bilateral ties, and he
expected Clinton's trip to play a positive role in developing
friendship between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Qu Miao, an undergraduate of the university's Department of
Economy, spoke highly of President Clinton's decisions to visit
China and to extend China's MFN status as "wise".
</P>
<P>
Adam Hickey, an exchange student from Illinois, said that
President Bill Clinton's visit will help increase mutual
understandings and the in-depth development of economic and
cultural exchanges between the two countries with considerable
impact to be exerted on the international arena.
</P>
<P>
Some political organizations in the United States, in an
attempt to win more votes or proceeding from their political
needs, may give some remarks unfavourable to China, which does
not represent the wishes of the American people, said Betty
F. Coggin, an English teacher at Xi'an Foreign Languages Institute.
</P>
<P>
However, she held that the US president's visit to China will
play a positive role in removing barriers between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
President Jiang Zemin's successful trip to the US last fall and
President Bill Clinton's coming visit to China will be of great
importance for the two nations to build a strategic partnership
for the 21st century, said Dr. Huang Minxing of Northwest
University.

<HEADLINE> Xi'an College Students, Teachers Optimistic on Sino-US Ties (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Dr. Huang went on to say that both countries have the basis of
cooperation in the battles against drugs, pollution, nuclear
proliferation, as well as in alleviation of the impact of the
financial crisis in southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
"The 20th century has been one of wars and armed conflicts, and
I hope that the coming century will be one of peace," he said,
adding that developing bilateral friendly and cooperative ties by
the means of seeking the common ground while reserving their
differences, accords with the current dominating trend in the
world.
</P>
<P>
President Clinton's visit to China will be a significant event
as the present world is closely inter-related and has increasingly
becoming a "global village" and the countries worldwide need all
the more exchanges and cooperation among them rather than
separation of each other, said Dr. Daniel Bennett from Stanford
University, who is currently teaching at the Northwest University.
</P>
<P>
The reform and opening up initiated by late Chinese leader Deng
Xiaoping two decades ago has opened China's gate to the rest of
the world, laying a very good basis for Sino-US ties, Dr. Bennett
noted.
</P>
<P>
He added that he is glad to see bilateral relations improving
over recent years, and hopes for a more frequent exchange of
visits by leaders of the two countries and enhanced exchanges and
cooperation in all fields, so that the two countries will build a
good partnership.

<HEADLINE> Hoodle Urges to Bring Back Common Sense Back to Refereeing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
PARIS, June 20 (Xinhua) -- England manager Glenn Hoddle urged a
return of "common sense" back into the World Cup refereeing after a
wave of red and yellow cards dominated the play in recent games.
</P>
<P>
Hoddle said:"I think in the first matches the (refereeing)
balance was right. There might have been a couple of isolated fouls
which could have resulted in red cards but all in all it wasn't too bad."
</P>
<P>
"We had the first five days of the tournament to look at what was
going to happen and how they were going to interpret the laws. But it
is almost as if we're starting all over again." said Hoddle.
</P>
<P>
"Obviously it is a worry. As long as it's the tackle from
behind that's punished, that's fine. But it's got to be sensible
and have a balance about it." Hoddle added.

<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, June 20 (Xinhua) -- Deputies of the finance ministers
and central bank governors from eighteen countries and regions are
holding an emergency meeting in Tokyo on Saturday to seek ways to
stabilize international currencies.
</P>
<P>
The one-day meeting is expected to issue a statement showing
the participants' willingness to cooperate in stabilizing global
currency markets.
</P>
<P>
It is believed that the meeting will reconfirm the necessity to
rectify the excessive depreciation of the Japanese yen against the
U.S. dollar, following the recent joint intervention by Japan and
the United States.
</P>
<P>
The deputies will also urge Japan to make further efforts,
including disposing of bad loans and reforming its tax system to
turn its economy around, so that it can help other Asian economies
recover by absorbing more imports from the region.
</P>
<P>
They are also to discuss the potential effects of China's
possible devaluation of its currency on fears that the country's
exports will lose competitive edge in the wake of the yen's
decline against the dollar.
</P>
<P>
The meeting is attended by delegates from Australia, Brunei,
China, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Malaysia, New Zealand, the

<HEADLINE> Kenya Bank Employees to Act over Loans Tax </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, June 20 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan bankers are set for
another showdown with the government over the taxation of
benefits arising from employer-subsidized low interest rate
loans.
</P>
<P>
All Banks Shopstewards Committee (ABSC) has rejected the
proposed financial bill on taxation of the low interest rate on
staff loan facilities, the East African Standard newspaper
reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
ABSC Chairman Jacob Opiyo threatened Friday to call
unionizable banking employees out on strike next week to protest
the move, saying the committee was facing mounting pressure from
the bank workers who are becoming too wild and uncontrollable.
</P>
<P>
He said that a meeting of all bank workers which will decide
on the next course of action have been called for Thursday next
week in Nairobi.
</P>
<P>
The proposal is against the Income Tax Act as borrowed money
is not an allowance received in respect of employment or services
rendered or gains or profits derived from employment.
</P>
<P>
"A loan is an expense which is repaid back every month plus
interest and therefore should not be treated as an employment
benefit," said Opiyo.
</P>
<P>
He said the taxation element at a prescribed rate on interest
at 15 percent will eat away all the net pay of bank workers.
</P>
<P>
Opiyo vowed that bankers would not sit down while the benefits
they have enjoyed for many years are taken away overnight.
</P>
<P>
"Bank workers can never work for negative salaries and if we
go on strike this time round we will never resume work until the
minister for finance scraps the entire tax on staff loan
facilities," he said.
</P>
<P>
Bank employees' strike earlier this year over the same dispute
ended with a retreat by the government which afterwards suspended
measures trying to collect this kind of taxation.

<HEADLINE> Ancient Capital Most Visited City in China  (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, June 20 (Xinhua) -- When Shenzhen and Shanghai, two
economic powerhouses along China's coastlines, represent China's
dramatic changes during the past two decades of reform and
opening-up, the ancient capitals of Beijing and Xi'an remain the
ideal sites for visitors to get a glimpse of the country's
splendid history.
</P>
<P>
Xi'an, currently the capital of northwest China's Shaanxi
province and the first stop of US President Bill Clinton's
imminent state visit to China, has become one of the most popular
destinations in China for international tourists with its rich and
invaluable collection of cultural relics.
</P>
<P>
Xi'an played the host to some 485,000 visitors from overseas
last year, earning 201 million US dollars in foreign exchanges, up
by 6.9 percent and 11.6 percent over 1996. Foreign visitors
accounted for 83 percent of the total.
</P>
<P>
Japanese tourists, totaling 143,000 last year, formed the
the bulk of foreign tourists, followed by the United States,
Britain, Germany and France.
</P>
<P>
Terra-cotta warriors unearthed near the Mausoleum of Qin Shi
Huang, or the first emperor of the Qin Dynasty (221-206 BC), is
the hottest and most famous tourist attraction in Xi'an. Since it
was first opened to visitors in October 1979, the Terra-cotta
Warriors Museum has received more than four million overseas
visitors, including foreign heads of states like former US
President Ronald Reagon, British Queen Elizabeth the Second,
former French President Francois Mitterrand, German Chancellor
Helmet Kohl and former Japanese prime ministers Noboru Takeshita
and Masayoshi Ohira and many other prestigious world statesmen.

A tourism network, radiating from the ancient capital of Xi'an,
has also taken shaped, with adjacent dotted historic sites such as
Huaqingchi -- an imperial park of the Tang Dynasty; Qianling --
the mausoleum of Empress Wu Zetian of Tang Dynasty (618-907), the
only woman in the Chinese history who proclaimed herself as the
sovereign; the Famen Temple which collects relics of Sakyamuni's
finger bone and a large amount of priceless imperial valuables of
Tang Dynasty; and the Mausoleum of Huangdi, the legendary founder
of the Chinese nation.

<HEADLINE> New Gold Mine Opens in Zimbabwe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, June 20 (Xinhua) -- A five million U.S. Dollar
alluvial gold mine, to be jointly developed by Zimbabwean and
Russian firms jointly, was commissioned Friday near Penhalonga of
east Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
The mine, a joint venture between the Development Trust of
Zimbabwe (DTZ) and a Russian company, Ozgeo, is the first of its
kind in Zimbabwe to engage in large-scale extraction and
processing of alluvial gold.
</P>
<P>
The venture came at a time when gold prices on the
international market have plummeted, throwing most gold mining
companies into viability crises.
</P>
<P>
The Dtz-Ozgeo joint venture, situated in the Mutare River
Valley, was awarded a special permit by the government
authorizing it to carry out mining activities within 500 meters
from the center to both sides of the river, the Zimbabwe News
Agency reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the mine's official opening ceremony, Zimbabwe's
Mines, Environment and Tourism Minister Simon Moyo expressed
satisfaction that the project will not adversely affect the
environment.
</P>
<P>
Despite the fact that environmental impact assessment studies
were not conducted, he said,the techniques of alluvial gold
extraction and washing are highly sophisticated and
environmentally friendly.
</P>
<P>
"Special attention has been placed on the protection of the
environment without any losses in efficiency. No toxic chemicals
are used in the entire mining process," Moyo said.
</P>
<P>
"Of great relief is that a closed water reticulation system is
used and no contaminated water enters Mutare river system," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Moyo noted that the venture's project proposals indicated that
at the end of the mining operations all land will be restored to
its original state through backfilling.

<P>
NAIROBI, June 20 (Xinhua) -- Iberia, Spain's national carrier,
is reviewing the possibility of reinstating its flights to Kenya
with a view to boosting tourist traffic between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
This will be in addition to the current Madrid-Johannesburg
frequencies that cover Kenya, Kenyan Permanent Secretary in the
Ministry of Tourism and Wildlife Elizabeth Masiga has said.
</P>
<P>
Top executives of the Spanish airline have promised to look
into the possibilities of re-opening the Madrid-Nairobi route
which was suspended some years ago, Masiga was quoted by Saturday's
Daily Nation newspaper as saying.
</P>
<P>
The airline may also consider providing travelers with an air
link to Latin America, she said.
</P>
<P>
The move will help Kenya tap the Spanish tourist market which
is considered to have one of the largest potential in the world.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, more than 7,300 Spanish tourists visited the east
African country.

<HEADLINE> Kenyan Shilling Gains in depressed Money Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, June 20 (Xinhua) -- The Kenyan Shilling is expected
to remain on the offensive next week after being strengthened
marginally against the U.S. Dollar in Friday's trading in a
depressed money market, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
Corporate buyers have showed little interest in picking up
dollars despite the attractive offers, they were quoted by
Saturday's Daily Nation newspaper as saying.
</P>
<P>
Dealers quoted the Shilling at around 59.55 Shillings buying
and 59.75 Shillings selling to the Dollar but closed at 59.80
Shillings buying and 60 Shillings selling Friday.
</P>
<P>
Importers' demand for Dollars remains low, while export
inflows of hard currency from tea and coffee sales are putting
upward pressure on the Shilling, dealers said.
</P>
<P>
They said the market was sluggish reflecting the generally low
economic activity as well as the usual end-of-week slowdown in
trading.
</P>
<P>
The Central Bank of Kenya (CBK) quoted the Shilling at a
commercial mean opening rate of 59.71 Shillings to the Dollar and
99.72 Shillings to the Sterling Pound compared to 59.85 Shillings
and 99.73 Shillings Thursday respectively.
</P>
<P>
The effects of high world tea prices, favorable weather
conditions and a bumper crop started to show this week with
companies in the tea sector starting to report a tremendous rise
in profits.
</P>
<P>
Reports from the Treasury bill market said the Thursday
auction recorded an average yield of 25.4 percent on the 91-day
tenor.
</P>
<P>
CBK was able to sell 91-day bills worth 5.38 billion Shillings
and 182-day bills worth 1.75 billion Shillings.
</P>
<P>
Commercial banks have also started lowering base lending rates
following a reduction of the cash ratio. The market is also
watching to see where the government will turn to for money after
exhausting its limit with CBK.
</P>
<P>
At the Nairobi Stock Exchange (NSE), trading slackened during
the week with turnover dropping to 82 million Shillings from 157
million Shillings last week.
</P>
<P>
The number of shares also fell to 1.3 million from 2.6 million
last week. The NSE 20 share index ended the week down 29.68
points to close at 2960.34.
</P>
<P>
The financial sector dominated the trading moving 548.000
Shares which accounted for 39.33 percent of the week's volume.
</P>
<P>
Barclays Bank moved 127,000 shares at between 99 Shillings and
107 Shillings while Kenya Commercial Bank was active with
123,000 shares traded at 69 Shillings.

<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, June 20 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh's exports grew by 16.75
percent and earned 188.46 billion taka (about 4.1 billion U.S.
dollars), about 10 million dollars less than the target, during
the first 10 months of the July 1997-June 1998 fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
Major export items like knitwear and hosiery products, raw jute
and jute goods, frozen foods and leather fell short of target in
the period, the English newspaper The Daily Star said Saturday
quoting the latest statistics of the Export Promotion Bureau
(EPB).
</P>
<P>
The overall export target would be hopefully achieved at the
end of the current fiscal year, the report quoted EPB Chairman
Fraisal Ahmed Chowdhury as saying.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh's 36.93 percent of export revenue came from the U.S
market which imported 1.541 billion dollars worth of Bangladesh's
products during the period.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. buyers imported ready-made garments from the country
worth about 1.155 billion dollars, frozen shrimp worth 124 million
dollars, and knitwear valued at 169 million dollars in the period.

<HEADLINE> Romania to Set Terms for Debt Talks with Sweden </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, June 20 (Xinhua) -- Romania will send a letter to
the Swedish Government to present its terms for resuming talks on
a 69-year-old debt which Romania owes Sweden, the local daily
National Monitor reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The debt, a 27 million-U.S.-dollar loan from Sweden in 1929,
has snowballed to about 3.5 billion U.S. dollars, according to an
estimate by the International audit firm Arthur Aandersen Agency.
</P>
<P>
This week, a commission for analyzing Sweden's debt claim
presented the cabinet with a report, setting preconditions for the
debt talks.
</P>
<P>
The report recommended that the Swedish side follow the
precedent of previous debt settlements between Romania and 14
other nations and that the negotiations should be at a government-
to-government level rather than government-to-company level.
</P>
<P>
If these conditions are met, the Ministers of Foreign Affairs,
Justice, Finance, and Industry and Trade will designate
international law experts to be included in the new negotiating
commission, the report proposed.
</P>
<P>
Swedish authorities said the loan was due in 1959, but they
had not received the money back.
</P>
<P>
In 1989 Sweden requested the repayment of the debt and
authorized the AB Electro Invest firm to negotiate with the
Romanian government. No agreement was reached as the two sides
differed regarding the amount of the debt.
</P>
<P>
After the 1996 elections, the Ciorbea-led government, prompted
by repeated calls from Poul Thomsen, an International Monetary
Fund negotiator and a Swedish national, showed willingness to
resume negotiations.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, Romanian Finance Minister Mircea Ciumara, who was
leading the Romanian team in the negotiations, reportedly agreed
to pay Sweden 800 million U.S. dollars for the debt.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh to Disburse Credit to Help Rural Poor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, June 20 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh is to provide 800 million
taka (17.4 million U.S. dollars) as micro-credit for the rural
poor during the 1998-98 financial year beginning July 1, a press
release reaching here Saturday said.
</P>
<P>
Since the project, the "Rural Bittaheen Program" of the Rural
Development Board, was started several years ago, some 16,900
Bittaheen Samabaya Samity (association of the rural destitute)
with about 474,800 members have been formed. And the members have
accumulated an amount of 375.3 million taka (about 8.16 million
dollars) as their own capital through weekly savings and purchase
of shares.
</P>
<P>
About 352,500 members of destitute families throughout the
country have received a total of 4.068 billion taka (about 88.42
million dollars) in micro-credit for income-generating activities
like pisciculture, mat making, tailoring, nurseries, small
trading, rickshaw pulling, pottery and handicraft.
</P>
<P>
Apart form the credit, about 275,000 members so far have also
received training in social development, skill development and
cooperative management.
</P>
<P>
Nearly half of about 127 million Bangladeshis live in poverty
and the project is part of the government's effort to reduce
poverty in the South Asian country.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Sanctions to Hit India's Economy Long-term </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, June 20 (Xinhua) -- Although the Indian government
said that the Untied States sanctions against India are
"counter-productive" and just a "minor road block" in furthering
Indo-U.S. trade relations, they are bound to have an adverse
impact on the country's economy in the long run, economic experts
said here Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Indications are that the country's infrastructure projects
would be the hardest hit with both multi-lateral and bilateral
funds drying up, especially fund from the World Bank, the Asian
Development Bank and OECF of Japan.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank board meeting on May 27 - to consider four major
loans for India's power, irrigation and roads sectors - was
postponed. This has turned the prospects of the 1.2 billion U.S.
dollars inflow very bleak, they said.
</P>
<P>
Since all fresh loans and concessional funds have been stopped
forthwith, the Power Finance Corporation's proposal for 500
million U.S. dollars each from the World Bank and the Asian
Development Bank is also in limbo. Several such loan proposals,
especially in the power sector, are bound to take a beating with
the G-8 endorsing the United States move to block multi-lateral
fund flow to India. The proposed one billion dollars loan to
India's Power Grid Corporation would also not materialize.
</P>
<P>
The drying up of funds from bilateral and multi-lateral
agencies is expected to result in a repayment problem for India,
since a large chunk of debt funds are utilized to make interest
related payments.
</P>
<P>
The denial of the U.S. exim bank guarantees is expected to make
funds costlier in the international debt market for Indian
corporations, especially pursuing infrastructure projects, they
further said.
</P>
<P>
The Prime Minister's Office (PMO) has been reportedly turned
into a hub of activity of drafting a blueprint to tackle the
sanctions. The finance minister convened a meeting of secretaries
heading economic ministries. The sanctions also came up for
discussion at the meeting of the Parliamentary Standing Committee
on Finance, where Opposition members demanded an action plan to
tackle the situation.

<HEADLINE> Singapore's External Trade Declines in May </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, June 20 (Xinhua) -- Singapore's total trade at
current prices declined by 6.1 percent in May 1998 over the same
month of 1997 on a three-month moving average basis, the country's
Trade Development Board (TDB) said in a press release Saturday.
</P>
<P>
By breakdown, imports shrank by 12 percent and exports
increased by 0.1 percent, with 1.1 percent increase in non-oil
domestic exports and 3.0 percent rise in non-oil re-exports and a
further 16.4 percent plunge in oil domestic exports, the TDB said.
</P>
<P>
Total trade volume fell by 1.8 billion Singapore dollars (1.05
billion U.S. dollars) to 27.31 billion Singapore dollars (1.59
billion U.S. dollars) compared with April this year.
</P>
<P>
Non-oil domestic exports increased by 1.1 percent to 7.1
billion Singapore dollars (4.13 billion U.S. dollars). Growth in
non-oil domestic exports to the U.S. and Europe slowed down to 7.8
percent and 10.1 percent over May 1997, after recording growths of
17.4 percent and 14.1 percent in April 1998. Non-oil domestic
exports to the regional economies as well as other major Asian
economies in May dropped with those to Malaysia, South Korea and
Japan down by 16.7 percent, 30.8 percent and 12.4 per cent
respectively over the same period last year, according to TDB.
</P>
<P>
Domestic exports of oil remained weak in May 1998, falling by
16.4 percent over May 1997.
</P>
<P>
Compared with May 1997, growth in non-oil re-exports also
moderated, increasing by only 3 percent to a level of 6.2 billion
Singapore dollars (3.6 billion U.S. dollars) in May 1998 while
non-oil imports shrank by 10 percent to reach a level of 11.9
billion Singapore dollars (6.92 U.S. dollars) the same month.
</P>
<P>
Declines were recorded in imports of integrated circuits,
PCBAs, blank computer tapes and discs, capacitors, parts of CTVs,
radios and VCRs and parts of aircraft, TDB said.
</P>
<P>
TDB attributed the weak performance to the oversupply of key
electronic products in the global market as well as the regional
economic crisis which has affected Singapore's exports to the
affected economies.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Bangladesh's Pharmaceutical Industry Makes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, June 20 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh has made remarkable
achievements in developing its own pharmaceutical industry since
the early 1980s, which can now meet 95 percent of the country's
demand for medicine.
</P>
<P>
The achievements are the result of the Drug (Control) Ordinance
the government promulgated in 1982 to expedite the sector's
development, to remove "harmful, useless and unnecessary"
medicines from the market and to ensure the supply of essential
drugs to ordinary people at affordable prices.
</P>
<P>
In 1981, there were 166 licensed pharmaceutical companies in
the country, but the domestic medicine market was dominated by
eight multinational companies producing about 75 percent of the
products.
</P>
<P>
Twenty-five medium-sized national companies at that time
produced only 15 percent of the products, with the remaining 10
percent manufactured by 133 small national companies. And these
local pharmaceutical companies were mainly engaged in formulation
with imported raw materials, spending about 600 million taka (13
million U.S. dollars) annually in foreign exchange.
</P>
<P>
With 166 local pharmaceutical production units, the country
still had to spend nearly 300 million taka (6.5 million dollars) a
year importing finished medicines.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, the Drug Ordinance 1982 has shown positive
impact on the country's pharmaceutical sector, with dependence on
imported drugs significantly lowered and foreign currency funds
utilized for importing only medicines not produced in the country.
</P>
<P>
The value of locally-produced medicines rose from 1.1 billion
taka (23.9 million dollars) in 1981 to 13.5 billion taka (294
million dollars) in 1997, while the share of essential drugs
increased significantly from 30 percent in 1981 to 64 percent in
1997.
</P>
<P>
At present, 95 percent of the domestic demand for medicines has
been met by local production, and government- and local
people-owned  pharmaceutical companies increased their share of
medicine output from 25 percent in 1981 to 65 percent in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Now there are 207 licensed drug manufacturing units in the
country producing about 5,600 brands of medicines, and there are
altogether 1,338 wholesale drug licensed units and 35,000 retail
drug license holders in Bangladesh.
</P>
<P>
Another remarkable progress the local pharmaceutical industry
has made since 1982 is the increase in the local production of
basic chemicals as well as their exports worldwide.
</P>
<P>
The growth in the pharmaceutical industry has also helped the
development of auxiliary industries making products such as glass
bottles, plastic containers, aluminum collapsible tubes, infusion
sets, disposable syringes and corrugated cartons. Some of these
products, after meeting the country's requirements, are also
exported to other countries.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, Bangladesh exported medicines worth of 220 million
taka (4.35 million dollars) to Vietnam, Singapore, Russia,
Pakistan, Thailand, the United States, as well as Central Asian
and African countries.

sharply as part of the government's austerity drive, and some TAT
overseas offices are being closed.
</P>
<P>
The tourism society, which represents several private-sector
organizations, called on the government to restore some of the
funds as well as set aside money for bidding on foreign
exhibitions and conferences.
</P>
<P>
Tourist arrivals to Thailand rose by just 3.2 percent in the
first four months compared with the same period last year, far
below the 5.4 percent target set by the TAT. The Amazing Thailand
1998-99 campaign has also been below its goal.
</P>
<P>
The tourism society suggested the government put more emphasis
on improving the quality of destinations and developing tourism
personnel to maintain the country's long-term advantages in the
tourism industry.

<HEADLINE> Thai Govt Urged to Lead in Economic Recovery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, June 20 (Xinhua) -- The Thai government should play a
leading role in the country's economic recovery by spurring
domestic demand and pushing forward with corporate debt
restructuring, the Bangkok Post Saturday quoted a World Bank
official as saying.
</P>
<P>
When addressing a business meeting Friday, Jayasankar
Shivakumar, country director for the World Bank, said the
government needed to adopt fiscal measures to inject liquidity
into the market to boost domestic demand and prevent the economy
sliding into a depression.
</P>
<P>
"During the past 10 years, the private sector led the economy
while the government was passive. But during this situation, the
government has to lead, orchestrate the work and maintain good
teamwork," he was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Shivakumar praised the achievements of the Chuan Leekpai
government, saying it had begun to win back confidence of the
international business community with its restructuring of the
economic and financial sector.
</P>
<P>
However, he warned that the kingdom had yet to bottom out and
more government infrastructure investment was needed to boost
growth.
</P>
<P>
He predicted the country would begin to recover around
mid-1999.
</P>
<P>
He said policy actions should be made to help ease the social
pressures of rising unemployment, while spurring private sector
demand, particularly for the real estate sector, is another
necessity.
</P>
<P>
He also called for a greater government role in
recapitalization of the banking sector.

<HEADLINE> Romanian Health Minister Resigns Amid Ructions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, June 19 (Xinhua) -- The Hungarian Democratic Union
of Romania, member of Romania's ruling coalition, on Friday
accepted Prime Minister Radu Vasile's request for Health Minister
Franciso Baranyi to step down.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister raised the request on Wednesday after
allegations that Baranyi secretly cooperated in the 1960s with the
then intelligence services.
</P>
<P>
Under an agreement between the ruling coalition parties, the
vacancy for the health minister has to be nominated for by the
Hungarian Democratic Union of Romania.
</P>
<P>
Over the past few days, the Romanian political arena has been
hit by an ongoing political storm, with party leaders,
parliamentary members and ministers accused of collaboration with
intelligence agencies prior to the nation's power handover in
December 1989.
</P>
<P>
Also involved in the ruckus are the National Peasants' Party
and the Democratic Party, both in the ruling coalition, and the
opposition Greater Romania Party.
</P>
<P>
The row emerged when some parliamentary members pressed
parliament to pass a law on access to the former security files.
</P>
<P>
Even before the adoption of the law, some newspapers have
brought some personal files to light, resulting in a number of
political figures, including the health minister, being
implicated.
</P>
<P>
The row has stirred up two different reactions among
the public. Some strongly urge those with an intelligence service
background to quit while others hold that the intelligence agents
under debate were a product of certain historical conditions and
oppose disciplinary action against them.
</P>
<P>
The Romanian intelligence authority has indicated its
determination to step up investigative efforts so as to bring to
court those who stole secret files from the former national
information agencies.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai Industrial Output Increases </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, June 20 (Xinhua) -- The latest statistics show that
Shanghai, China's economic powerhouse, registered an 8.8 percent
growth rate in industrial output dring the first five months of
this year.
</P>
<P>
During the period, the municipality completed 226.4 billion
yuan (27.3 billion US dollars) of output, according to the local
statistics bureau.
</P>
<P>
Except for the solely state-owned firms, the economic sector
increased its industrial output value.
</P>
<P>
But statistics for the four-month January-April period
reflected a profit decline because of poor sales in the industrial
sector. The profits of the sector dropped by 28.5 percent while
losses rose by 26.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
The foreign-funded firms suffered the most during the period,
affected by fewer exports under the pressure of the Southeast
Asian financial crisis, according to the bureau.
</P>
<P>
Economists said that the macro-economic measures have been
effective in preventing the economy from sliding further, but an
overall economic revival will still take time.

<HEADLINE> Thailand Sees No Upturn Before Mid-1999: WB Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, June 20 (Xinhua) -- The Thai economy would not start
to recover before the middle of 1999, six months later than
previously predicted by the International Monetary Fund (IMF), a
World Bank official said.
</P>
<P>
Jayasankar Shivakumar, director of the World Bank office in
Thailand, said in remarks published Saturday by The Nation
newspaper that Thailand's economic growth this year would probably
measure minus 5 percent to 8 percent. The World Bank earlier
forecast growth of minus 5 percent.
</P>
<P>
The IMF and the Thai Finance Ministry previously predicted
economic recovery in the fourth quarter of this year, but that was
unlikely to happen, according to Shivakumar.
</P>
<P>
He said that in the next economic review in August, it is
possible that the World Bank's estimate would drop lower than
minus 5 percent for 1998.
</P>
<P>
Ss some Thais are currently negative towards foreign
investment, Shivakumar suggested that Thailand accept foreign
direct investment while setting up mechanisms that would enable
Thais to maintain the right of asset possession.
</P>
<P>
He cited South Korea's move to protect its future national
interests even though it has to sell local assets to foreigners.
</P>
<P>
"Thailand has no other choice. At present, the country needs
foreign direct investment to recover," he said. "Thus, you have to
make sure that foreign direct investment serves Thailand's
interests."
</P>
<P>
He stressed that Thailand should begin working on how to
protect itself from possible future crises.
</P>
<P>
He said that although the recent intervention by the U.S. and
Japan in the currency market was effective, the crisis could
return.
</P>
<P>
Thailand, now in a deep recession, has high interest rates and
a credit crunch which are severely hurting the real sector, while
exports and domestic demand have slumped. According to the World
Bank, the manufacturing index this year is expected to record a
23-percent negative growth. Consumer inflation had already risen
to 10.2 percent by May.

<HEADLINE> Survey Shows Huge Potential of Children's Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 20 (Xinhua) -- A recent survey on children's
consumer trends in five major Chinese cities indicates a huge
market potential for domestic and imported children's goods.
</P>
<P>
According to the survey by an information company of the State
Statistics Bureau, each one-child family in Beijing, Shanghai,
Guangzhou, Chengdu and Xi'an spends an average of 672 yuan (81
US dollars) each month on children.
</P>
<P>
The monthly spending in Beijing is the highest, reaching 764
yuan (92 US dollars) per child, followed by the 736 yuan (88.7 US
dollars) of Shanghai. And the lowest for children in Xi'an is
merely 207 yuan (24.9 US dollars).
</P>
<P>
According to statistics, the above five cities have a total of
5.21 million children aged from one to 12 years old, and their
combined monthly spending top 3.5 billion yuan (421.9 million US
dollars). The survey also reveals that foodstuffs and clothing
make up the bulk of the spending for children, accounting for 66.4
percent.
</P>
<P>
The consumption on toys and recreation service comes up the
second, composing 12.3 percent; and that on study-related
commodities makes up 9.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
The survey also points to the huge potential for imported
children's goods, as 26.4 percent of the respondents voiced their
preference to purchasing foodstuffs imported from overseas and
21.6 percent expressed their interests in imported toys.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, statistics show that the five cities have imported a
total of 10 billion yuan (1.2 billion US dollars) worth of
children's commodities imported from overseas every year.

<HEADLINE> Mullet Bay in Dalian Cleaned up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 20 (Xinhua) -- The once severely-polluted Mullet
Bay of the port city Dalian has been cleaned up thanks to
environmental protection measures.
</P>
<P>
According to today's China Daily, the once blue waters of the
Bay was polluted and blocked by silts and industrial wastes,
mainly from a local chemical plant located across the Bay.
</P>
<P>
This not only turned the Bay of the scenic city in northeast
China into a "stink ditch', but also handicapped the launching of
ships of the Dalian New Shipyard, the largest and most important
shipbuilding exporting base in the country.
</P>
<P>
From 1990 to 1996, the shipyard dredged the dock twenty times,
digging up about two million cubic meters of white silt, and
spending more than 22 million yuan (2.7 million US dollars).
</P>
<P>
Between 1996 and 1997, the shipyard spent another 40 million
yuan (4.8 million US dollars) clearing white silt for 420 meters.
</P>
<P>
In an anti-pollution effort, a 1,924-meter-long dam was erected
to block away the industrial alkali dregs from the 64-year-old
Dalian Chemical Industry Group Ltd Co. on the northern bank of the
bay.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the surrounding water and beaches have returned to
normal and crowds of sea gulls come with the tides, heralding the
improvement of the environment and the gradual revival of the
local biosystem.

<HEADLINE> Hubei Province Develops Wudang Mountain Tourism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN, June 20 (Xinhua) -- Wudang Mountain in central China's
Hubei Province attracted more than 500,000 tourists during the
January-May period, up 30 percent on the 1997 period.
</P>
<P>
The development of infrastructure facilities and development of
tourism resources has helped to transform Wudang Mountain into a
magnet for tourism.
</P>
<P>
Wudang, one of China's Taoist mountains featuring the religion
and philosophy Lao-Tzu introduced in the 6th century B.C., is
located in northwest Hebei, and was listed as a UNESCO World
Cultural Heritage in 1994.
</P>
<P>
Hubei Province has increased inputs to improve the mountain's
infrastructure facilities in recent years. The effort has included
completion of 25-km access road, running tap water to the highest
peak which reaches an elevation of 1,612 meters, installing 3,000
program-controlled telephones in Wudang and constructing a
cableway at a cost of 15 million yuan (1.8 million US dollars).
</P>
<P>
The province set up the Wudang Mountain Special Economic and
Tourism Zone to accelerate the development of tourism
resources. The overall goal is to transform Wudang Mountain into
an area offering a combination of Taoism culture and beautiful
scenery.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Addresses Mayors Meeting Via Satellite </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 19 (Xinhua) -- President Bill Clinton warned a
meeting of U.S. mayors on Friday that inequities in schools,
housing and employment cited in a new federal report threaten the
rejuvenation and long-term well-being of their cities.
</P>
<P>
"Our cities are revitalized, energized and back in business,"
Clinton said in an address transmitted by satellite from the White
House to more than 300 city leaders attending the annual U.S.
Conference of Mayors in Reno, Nevada.
</P>
<P>
"We cannot sit back and bask in the glow," the Associated Press
quoted Clinton as saying.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, Secretary of Housing and Urban Development
Andrew Cuomo gave the nation's cities a good bill of health, but
said an "opportunity gap" which held down the nation's poorest
citizens poses a constant threat.
</P>
<P>
"This is a midterm report card with an 'A' grade but there is
still homework to be done," Cuomo said of the second annual "State
of the Cities" report released at the U.S. Conference of Mayors.
</P>
<P>
While crediting the nation's strong five-year economic
performance for the reduction in unemployment that nearly every
major American city enjoys, Cuomo said a discrepancy between the
number of low-skill jobs available and the number of people
seeking them was a cause for worry.
</P>
<P>
At a time when wealth was being created for many, others
remained trapped in a cycle of poverty, poor educational
opportunities and homelessness, Cuomo said.
</P>
<P>
"We have more millionaires than at any time in our history,"
Cuomo said. "But an estimated 600,000 Americans still sleep on our
streets every night."
</P>
<P>
Good news for cities abounds in the 75-page report.
</P>
<P>
The economy has produced 16 million new jobs and record low
unemployment, it says. Unemployment in central cities fell to an
average of 5.3 percent early this year from 8.2 percent in 1993.
</P>
<P>
Crime, the age-old bane of city dwelling, has been tamed to a
degree, with violent crime dropping 19 percent in big cities
between 1993 and 1997.
</P>
<P>
But the report says, poor city residents are being left behind
by growing numbers of middle-class residents. The report says that
since 1970, nearly six million middle-income and affluent families
have left central cities.
</P>
<P>
Poor schools are one of the most frequently cited reasons for
the middle-class flight, according to the study. In 1994 and 1996,
60 percent of children in urban school districts failed to achieve
basic competency on standardized reading and math tests.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Marcos' Burial Controversial in Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, June 20 (Xinhua) -- President-elect Joseph Estrada's
plan to bury the late president Ferdinand Marcos at the heroes'
cemetery in Manila has aroused protests in the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
Estrada said earlier this month that he would allow the remains
of Marcos to be interred in the cemetery which is usually for war
heroes and presidents on July 11 after 9 years of his death.
</P>
<P>
Estrada, who will assume the presidency on June 30, urged his
countrymen to forgive their former leader, citing Marcos' role in
fighting the Japanese invaders during the Second World War.
</P>
<P>
"We have to honor and respect a dead man. Let's bury him and
everything with him will be buried", Estrada said, adding there
would be no state honors for Marcos and he would attend the burial
if he has time.
</P>
<P>
However, Estrada's plan drew widespread protests in the
country. Some 28 groups including the church, the business sector,
human rights advocates and professionals recently formed a
coalition and launched a signature drive to voice their anger at
the planned burial of Marcos.
</P>
<P>
Former president Corazon Aquino, who accused Marcos of being a
dictator and masterminding the assassination of her husband,
opposition leader Benigno Aquino, in 1983, led a mass protest
rally near the Presidential Palace.
</P>
<P>
Benigno Aquino's death fueled the masses' anger at the Marcos
administration. Three years later, Marcos was ousted in a popular
revolt called "People's Power" in 1986.
</P>
<P>
Marcos fled to Hawaii, the United States, and died there three
years later. Corazon Aquino, who succeeded him, refused to allow
the return of his remains to the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
Her successor, President Fidel Ramos, allowed the remains of
his distant cousin to be taken to his hometown Batac, Ilocos
Norte, in 1993, but refused to grant him a state funeral. Marcos'
corpse now lies in a refrigerated mausoleum at the Marcos
ancestral home.
</P>
<P>
"The definition of hero and dictator can not be interchanged.
Is it right to honor a dictator who ordered the killing of
thousands of Filipinos, who allowed the torture of those who
opposed him?" Aquino queried, warning she might launch another
"People's Power" if Estrada would not change his mind.
</P>
<P>
Estrada, however, stood firm on his decision. He advised those
opponents to focus on more pressing concerns including crimes,
poverty and unemployment.
</P>
<P>
"It is not a problem as long as it doesn't violate the
Constitution and the law of the land," he said. The burial did not
mean all the criminal cases filed against the Marcoses would also
be "buried", he added.
</P>
<P>
"Definitely, we will not forget the cases of unexplained wealth
against the Marcoses," he said. "These will continue to be
investigated and prosecuted in the courts."

In the past 12 years, a total of 35 civil and criminal cases
had been filed against the Marcoses, but most of them were
dismissed for lack of evidence.
</P>
<P>
Last January, a division of the Supreme Court ruled that
Imelda, the widow of Marcos, was sentenced to 9 to 12 years'
imprisonment for corruption in an illegal land deal.
</P>
<P>
Imelda, currently on parole, is appealing to the Supreme Court
for reversion. She is not expected to be locked behind the bar.
</P>
<P>
After Imelda's sentence, two Swiss banks returned 300 million
U.S. dollars of Marcos' wealth to the Philippines. Last week, the
banks said they were ready to transfer another 270 million U.S.
dollars to Manila.
</P>
<P>
Despite the protests, Marcos' burial seems not to be affected,
analysts said. His grave in the cemetery is almost ready and
details of the burial are being planned.

<HEADLINE> Venezuela Expects Little Change in Oil Prices by OPEC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CARACAS, June 19 (Xinhua) -- The meeting of the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) scheduled for next week in
Vienna will not change in any major way the oil prices
performance, a leading Venezuelan petrol businessman said.
</P>
<P>
Luis Guisti, president of Petroleos de Venezuela, told the "El
Nacional" newspaper that the market would not necessarily react
to the OPEC meeting, but would be effected by seasonal changes in
the the third and fourth quarters of this year."
</P>
<P>
"We are entering a different season of the year and this will
affect the prices," he predicted.
</P>
<P>
Guisti said the benchmark West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude,
now over 15.40 U.S. dollars per barrel, would have to reach 17
dollars achieve the provisions stated in Venezuela's national
budget.
</P>
<P>
"If the WTI price reaches that level, we will easily achieve
the 13 dollars for the Venezuelan basket," he noted.
</P>
<P>
Guisti said he expected the long-awaited recovery to come after
mid-year. The second quarter of the year, which historically was
the worst, was about to finish. Venezuela had large stocks of
oil, and that makes it necessary to wait for later in the year
year," he explained.
</P>
<P>
He said factors deciding oil prices included Germany's
purchases to supply its strategic reserves, and the suspension of
production for maintenance in the North Sea in August.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Govt Eases Bank Capital Requirements </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, June 20 (Xinhua) -- In another concerted effort to
speed up the restructuring process of Indonesia's ailing banking
industry, the government eased bank capital requirements Friday,
local press Saturday quoted a minister as saying.
</P>
<P>
Existing banks were no longer required to have a minimum
paid-up capital of 250 billion rupiah (25 million U.S. dollars) by
the end of this year, Minister of Finance Bambang Subianto said.
</P>
<P>
"Only new banks are now obliged to meet this capital
requirement," Bambang told reporters after meeting with President
B.J. Habibie.
</P>
<P>
In an effort to force ailing banks to merge, Indonesia set
tough minimum paid-up capital requirements of between 1 trillion
rupiah (100 million U.S. dollars) and 2 trillion rupiah (200
million U.S. dollars) last January.
</P>
<P>
But the 1 trillion rupiah requirement was later slashed down to
250 billion rupiah following strong objections from the banking
community and the deadline for the 250 billion rupiah requirement
was extended to the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
Bambang urged owners of the country's ailing banks to
accelerate the process of recapitalizing their institutions to
meet the capital requirements.
</P>
<P>
The minister said that the capital adequacy ratio (CAR) for
banks was also lowered so that they were now required to fulfill a
minimum CAR of only 4 percent by the end of 1998, 8 percent in
1999 and 10 percent by the end of 2000.
</P>
<P>
The previous CAR requirements were 8 percent by the end of this
year, 10 percent by the end of next year and 12 percent by the end
of 2000.
</P>
<P>
"This is part of the overall effort to revive the economy and
the banking sector in particular," the minister explained.

<HEADLINE> HKFA "Painful" of Players Involved in Match-fixing Scandal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 19 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong Football
Association (HKFA) said in a statement here on Friday that it felt
"painful" to the allegations against the Hong Kong Team players
and the confession of one of them for being involved in the
match-fixing scandal.
</P>
<P>
"We are ever more disappointed for such incident happened to
the Hong Kong Team," said the statement.
</P>
<P>
"It has been our motives to develop and promote the game in
Hong Kong and emphasis is particularly placed on the set-up and
training of the representative sides," as they represent Hong
Kong, which has become a special administrative region of China
since July last year, in international tournaments.
</P>
<P>
"Their performance and achievement directly relate to the image
of Hong Kong football," it said.
</P>
<P>
Shortly after the news broke over the weekend, HKFA's president
Timothy Fok contacted FIFA President-elected Sepp Blatter, saying
that HKFA backs his proposal for a football school to teach just
skills but also ethics. HKFA concurs with the FIFA chief, who had
said football was more than a game and was a social obligation,
the statement said.
</P>
<P>
HKFA believes something positive can be made of something so
negative and it must take this chance to review the structure of
the game, it continued.
</P>
<P>
"We reiterate our position against the influence of match
results by dishonest means as well as our determination to prevent
 similar incidents from happening again," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The game's local governing body will set up an ad hoc working
party to deal with the players concerned and prudently study and
discuss measures to avoid the reoccurrence of such unhappy
incident," the statement added.
</P>
<P>
Six local senior division players were arrested last week by
Hong Kong's Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC)
following allegations that they had received bribes before making
the Hong Kong team lose two goals in a World Cup Asian Preliminary
Round Group 6 match on March 9, 1997.
</P>
<P>
Chan Tsz-kong, one of the players arrested, pleaded guilty to
conspiracy at a court hearing here on Friday, to fix the result of

HEFEI, June 20 (Xinhua) -- The comprehensive agricultural
productivity of east China's Anhui Province, which played an
important symbolic role in China's market-oriented reforms, has
improved significantly in the past two decades.
</P>
<P>
As the place where the household responsibility system was
initiated in 1978, Anhui now has become a major producer
of food grain, cotton edible oil, among other things.

Anhui's grain output reached 28 billion kg last year, a surge
of 13.7 billion kg from 1978. Also last year, Anhui's cotton
output reached 300,00 tons, a rise of 1.6 times over the 1978
figure, edible oil output hit 2.05 million tons, up 5.3 times,
meat output totaled 2.77 million tons, up 4.6 times, and aquatic

</P>
<P>
Officials are optimistic about further increases in Anhui's
agricultural production, as some 2.6 million ha of low-yielding
farmland still has great potential in productivity.

Against Corruption (ICAC) in its investigation into an illegal
match betting syndicate allegedly facilitated by corruption.
</P>
<P>
Chan, a member of the Hong Kong Special Administration Region
(SAR) Team at last year's World Cup Asian Zone qualifying
tournament, admitted one count of conspiring with the team's
goalkeeper Lok Kar-win and others to fix the result of a March 9,
1997 match against Thailand.
</P>
<P>
Shortly before the match, Chan, Lok and two other members of
the team decided they should only cause the team to lose two goals
in order not to arouse suspicion. Chan approached to another
teammate who agreed to join the scheme. Thailand subsequently won
the match 2-0.
</P>
<P>
Chan later obtained 200,000 HK dollars (25,600 U.S. dollars)
from a bookmaker for himself and others involved in the scandal.
</P>
<P>
Magistrater Garry Tallentire adjourned sentencing until next
month.

<HEADLINE> Fuzhou Development Zone Attracts More Overseas Investment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FUZHOU, June 20 (Xinhua) -- A state-level development zone in
this capital of east China's Fujian Province has been successful
in minimizing the effects of the Asian financial crisis and drawn
more overseas investment.
</P>
<P>
Fifty-three overseas-funded projects were approved in the
Fuzhou Development Zone in the first five months of this year,
with total investment and contracted overseas investment valued at
300 million US dollars and 230 million US dollars,
respectively. All three figures were considerably larger than
their counterparts for the same period of last year.
</P>
<P>
To cope with the effects of the Asian financial crisis, the
zone authorities have readjusted their strategy to attract
overseas investment, particularly increasing the effort to draw
investment from Japan, Europe and the United States.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, they attached keen importance to spreading investment
information and launched several investment fairs.
</P>
<P>
As part of its effort to improve the soft investment
environment, the zone rectified related administrative fees and
introduced preferential rates to the maximum extent.

<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, June 20 (Xinhua) -- Some areas of east China's
Zhejiang Province have been affected by a rain spell in the past
three consecutive years.
</P>
<P>
Torrential rains have stormed the cities of Quzhou, Lanxi,
Jiande and Jinhua, and Lishui Prefecture in western Zhejiang since
the entry of what is called the plum rain season on the Chinese
lunar calender on June 16. The daily rainfall exceeded 150 mm in
some of these places and the water flow at part of the Qiantang
River reached the maximum of 9,000 cubic meters each second.
</P>
<P>
In Qingyuan, Longquan and Pan'an, standing crops have been
flattened and irrigation networks and water conservancy facilities
have been wrecked or damaged to varying extent.
</P>
<P>
Heavy or torrential rains will continue in Zhejiang Province in
the near future, according to meteorological forecasts. To ensure
safety, the Hangzhou navigation authorities have declared
first-rate flood control on the Qiantang River and banned vessels
on the upper stream from entering the river.

<HEADLINE> Annan Calls for Restraint in Cyprus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, June 19 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan Friday appealed again to parties to the Cyprus dispute to
abstain from any action to increase tension on the island.
</P>
<P>
His remarks appeared in a statement made by his spokesman which
said, "In recent days, there have been signs of increased military
activity in Cyprus and in the region."
</P>
<P>
"The secretary-general reiterates the appeal he made in his
good offices report of June 16 and trusts that all parties
involved will abstain from any action which could add to the
tension," it said.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has remained divided since Turkish troops took over the
northern third of the island in 1974 following a failed pro-Athens
coup in Nicosia, the capital.
</P>
<P>
Tensions have been mounting since early last year when Cyprus
ordered the Russian-made S-300 anti-aircraft misslies, due to be
delivered later this year. Turkey has threatened to use all means
to block their deployment.
</P>
<P>
Turkey sent six F-16 fighters to the Turkish Cypriot-controlled
northern Cyprus Thursday in retaliation for the landing of six
Greek warplanes in the Greek Cyprus-controlled south earlier this
week.
</P>
<P>
In his report to the U.N. Security Council, Annan said Tuesday
that his special adviser on Cyprus intends to visit the island in
coming weeks.
</P>
<P>
He expressed regret at the failure of his efforts to bring the
concerned parties to direct negotiations.

<HEADLINE> Power Cut to Go On in Moldova </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, June 19 (Xinhua) -- Power cut is to go on in the
Republic of Moldova because Ukraine stopped supplying electricity
while Russia reduced its gas supply in half to Moldova, the
Moldovan BASA-Press reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The state-run Moldtranselectro, which is dealing with delivery
of electric energy to the distributing agencies, switched off in
these days the electricity around Moldova following the recent cut
of gas delivery by Russia, Moldtranselectro director Mihail
Cebotari said.
</P>
<P>
Cebotari said that the company will continue to cut off users
from the grids unless the government presents to Russia's gas
monopoly Gazprom a plan of debt repayment.
</P>
<P>
Gazprom, Moldova's major source of energy, cut its gas supply
in half in a bid to press for an immediate payment of the 200
million dollar gas dues. The move has affected the operation of
the leading power plant in Moldova, which provides 80 percent of
the country's electricity.
</P>
<P>
According to Cebotari, Moldovan users were supplied only 80
percent of their electricity consumption in the first five months
of this year.
</P>
<P>
Power shortages in Moldova have crippled government
institutions, hospitals, banks, telecommunication services and
public transportation.
</P>
<P>
Electricity was cut off in half of the capital city of
Chisinau, including the downtown with its governmental buildings
and parliament, for several hours Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Continues to Criticize Republicans Over </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 19 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
Friday described Republican attempts to work out a slimmed-down
anti-smoking legislation a "charade" and nothing but a rush for
political "cover."
</P>
<P>
Clinton accused the Republicans of playing political games to
protect the tobacco industry while ignoring the health threat to
children.
</P>
<P>
Since Wednesday's defeat of a comprehensive tobacco bill
sponsored by Republican Senator John McCain in the Senate, there
have been reports that Congress is working on a narrowly focused
bill.
</P>
<P>
"I'm against anything that provides no lifesaving to kids and
is designed to save the political life of the people who vote for
it, to provide cover, but won't save the lives of the children,"
Clinton said. "I don't see why we should participate in a
charade."
</P>
<P>
Speaker of the House of Representatives Newt Gingrich said
Thursday that next week he would propose a slimmed-down bill
focused on discouraging children from smoking by more closely
regulating access to cigarettes rather than raising the per-pack
price.
</P>
<P>
The McCain bill that Clinton supported would have raised the
price by at least 1.10 dollar a package over five years. It also
would have allowed the Food and Drug Administration to regulate
cigarette advertising and marketing and would have forced the
tobacco companies to pay heavy penalties if the level of teen
smoking did not fall to specific level.

<HEADLINE> Russia: Humanitarian Program for Iraq, Temporary </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, June 19 (Xinhua) -- The humanitarian program
for Iraq is a temporary measure, and permanent measures for the
Iraqi people could only be taken after the sanctions against the
country were lifted, Russia's Ambassador to the United Nations
Sergey Lavrov stressed here Friday.
</P>
<P>
Lavrov made the remarks after the United Nations Security
Council adopted a resolution which authorized Iraq to import 300
million U.S. dollars worth of oil equipment and spare parts to
upgrade its capacity of oil export. The resolution also noted that
Iraq's new food distribution plan approved by the U.N.
secretary-general on May 29, 1998 would not automatically be
rewritten every six months but would continue unless the U.N.
secretary-general approved changes.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the council after it voted on the resolution, Lavrov
said it was important to ensure that the resolution did not change
existing procedures for approving the distribution plan.
</P>
<P>
The ambassador said that for each new phase of the operation,
the Iraq government must submit a draft for a new plan to be
approved by the U.N. secretary-general, and that procedure stemmed
from the resolution just unanimously adopted by the council.
</P>
<P>
He said there was a new spirit of cooperation that existed
between Iraq and the United Nations due to the U.N.
secretary-general's last visit to Iraq, and the speeding up of
United Nations humanitarian operation in Iraq required the
adoption of urgent measures to rehabilitate the Iraqi oil industry.
</P>
<P>
The ambassador added that work must be done in accordance with
Security resolution 1153 of 1998 and the distribution plan
approved by the U.N. chief.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa Says Trade Minister Not WTO Chief </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, June 19 (Xinhua) -- South Africa has no
intention of nominating its Trade and Industry Minister Alec
Erwin or any one of its nationals to the position of
Director-General of the World Trade Organization (WTO), a Foreign
Ministry spokesman said Friday night.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman was reacting to news reports that Erwin is in
line for the WTO top job after WTO Director-General, Renato
Ruggiero, indicated that he will not seek a second term.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said the rumors are unfounded, the South African
Press Association reported.
</P>
<P>
Business Day newspaper Monday quoted Reuter as saying that
Erwin is a candidate along with former New Zealand prime minister
Michael Moore, former Canadian Trade Minister Bruce MacLaren, and
Brazilian Foreign Minister Luiz Lampreia.

<HEADLINE> Paraguay Hold Spain to Goalless Draw </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
SAINT-ETIENNE, June 19 (Xinhua) -- Paraguay held Spain to a
disappointing goalless draw in a Group D match here on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Spanish coach Javier Clemente made five changes to his
starting line-up in the match against Nigerian which they lost 3-2.
But the Spanish team appeared nervous in the first half and could
not find a way to break up the tight defence of the Paraguay team.
</P>
<P>
The second half was more exciting as the Spanish team went all out
for attack while the Paraguay team time and again luanched
counter-attacks which posed real threat to the Spanish goal.
</P>
<P>
The Spanish forwards, without the effective support from the
midfield, seldom got the shooting chances in the packed Paraguay
area and the draw further jeoperdized their qualifying chances.
</P>
<P>
The Spanish team garnered only one point after two matches and
must beat Bulgaria in their last group match to keep their
quliifying hopes alive.
</P>
<P>
But if the Nigerian team, which secured the top place of the
group due to the Paraguay-Spain draw, lose to Paraguay in their
encounter, the Spaniards will still be eliminated.
</P>
<P>
Spain were regarded by many people as one of the five favorites
of the World Cup finals before the tournament kicked off on June 10.

<HEADLINE> Norway Could Beat Brazil: Coach </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LA BOULE, France, June 19 (Xinhua) -- Norway could have a chance to
beat defending champion Brazil in their last group A match, Norway
coach Egil Olsen said on Friday.
</P>
<P>
"If we defend well it's not impossible to beat Brazil as our
strikers are good," said Olsen in the team's camp in
Saint-Andre-des-Eaux.
</P>
<P>
He said his team had had five scoring chances in their last game
against Scotland on Tuesday, which indicated their strength in
offense.
</P>
<P>
"I can say we went fairly well then. When the intensity and
aggressiveness goes in the midfield, which is what happened, our whole
defensive system pays the price."
</P>
<P>
He added that several players, including Chelsea forward Tore Andre
Flo, had failed to give their best.
</P>
<P>
"We've worked hard in training to correct these gaps and we can
legitimately hope for a win," he concluded.

<HEADLINE> China: Oil-for-Food Program, Temporary Arrangement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, June 19 (Xinhua) -- The "oil-for-food" program
is a provisional and temporary arrangement to meet the
humanitarian needs in Iraq, Chinese Permanent Representative to
the United Nations Qin Huasun stressed here Friday.
</P>
<P>
Ambassador Qin was responding to a resolution of the Security
Council of the United Nations which was adopted Friday morning.
The resolution allowed Iraq to import 300 million U.S. dollars
worth of oil equipment and spare parts. At the same time, the
resolution noted that Iraq's new food distribution plan approved
by the U.N. secretary-general on My 29, 1998 would not
automatically be rewritten every six months but would continue
unless the U.N. secretary-general approved changes.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the council before it began to vote on the
resolution, Qin said, "The oil-for-food program should not be a
substitute for or a means of delaying the lifting of sanctions on
Iraq."
</P>
<P>
"The current draft before the council was only a technical
resolution and some parts of it were not necessary," Qin said.
</P>
<P>
"However, in order to speed the import of equipment as soon as
possible, China will support the resolution, and the import of
spare parts should be realized as soon as possible," he added.

<HEADLINE> Romania, Turkey to Strengthen Economic Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, June 19 (Xinhua) - Turkish investors don't need the
green light of the International Monetary Fund or other world
finance bodies to come to Romania, visiting Turkish Prime Minister
Mesut Yilmaz told businessmen Friday in Bucharest.
</P>
<P>
Mesut Yilmaz, who, together with his Romanian counterpart Radu
Vasile, had a meeting with local and foreign businessmen in
Bucharest, also said the interest of the Turkish investors in
Romania is grounded on the friendship between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Stressing the "excellent" bilateral relations, the Turkish
prime minister showed that his country sees Romania as a partner
"for strengthening cooperation in the Balkans and Europe." "It's
time for Turkish and Romanian businessmen to expand to third
markets," he said, adding that the Turkish government's message to
investors is: "Turkey will strengthen cooperation with Romania."
</P>
<P>
In turn, Radu Vasile thanked foreign businessmen in general and
Turkish ones in particular for having ignored the problems caused
by the transition process and accepted Romania as "a country with
great potential."
</P>
<P>
He sent to Turkish businessmen the Romanian government's
message: "Keep on doing business in Romania and we shall secure
the necessary framework so that your benefits and the benefits to
Romania will be mutually advantageous."
</P>
<P>
Mesut Yilmaz ended his two-day visit to Romania Thursday
evening. He is the first prime minister of Turkey who visited
Romania after a 12-year break-off. Mesut Yilmaz was accompanied by
many businessmen.
</P>
<P>
Turkey is a very important partner of Romania in the economic
domain. The volume of bilateral trade was 567 million U.S. dollars
in 1997, and is expected to reach 1 billion this year. Turkey is
at the same time among the most important investors in Romania.
