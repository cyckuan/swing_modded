STEWART BELONGS IN HIS UNIFORM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PEDRO GOMEZ  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   As much as  &UR; Dave Stewart pines to wear an Italian suit and sit
in the front office of some club, he needs to reconsider that
notion.
</P>
<P>
   Some people belong in a uniform and Stewart, San Diego's
first-year pitching coach, is at the top of that list.
</P>
<P>
   The scene before the start of Game 1 of the World Series was a
keeper: Here were five of San Diego's pitchers, each of them
wide-eyed with the whole Bronx scene and Stewart was in the middle,
telling war stories from one of the five World Series he pitched
in.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly,  &UR; Andy Ashby, the antithesis of a big-city guy, was
hop-scotching in the outfield, having the time of his life.
Stewart's strength lies is making his pitchers achieve more than
they thought imaginable.
</P>
<P>
   Ashby, who won a career-high 17 games this season, is a perfect
example of what Stewart accomplished this season. Stewart simply
belongs in a uniform, no ifs, ands or buts. &QL; 
Take this job, please &QL; 
The Los Angles Dodgers are having one heck of a time finding
someone willing to become their manager. It's almost become a
running joke within baseball how they would be willing to take
anyone who will fill the post.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Jim Leyland twice turned down the opportunity for an interview.
 &UR; Felipe Alou had agreed to the job before being overwhelmed by a
counteroffer from Montreal. It now appears (in no particular order)
 &UR; Kevin Kennedy,  &UR; Davey Johnson or  &UR; Jim Fregosi will replace  &UR; Glenn
 &UR; Hoffman, who held the job the last three months on an interim
basis.
</P>
<P>
   The pair of high-profile turndowns has made the FOX folks, who
now own the Dodgers, slightly embarrassed. After all, the Dodgers
are supposed to stand as one of the marquee franchises in baseball.
</P>
<P>
   Now people are wondering what's wrong, why can't they get their
man to manage. New General Manager  &UR; Kevin Malone and club president
 &UR; Bob
 &UR; Graziano are simmering on a bit of a hot seat.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly, just like Bob and Kevin, we would be happier if we
were about to be announcing Felipe as the manager,'' said Fox
executive  &UR; Peter Chernin. ``Felipe decided to stay in Montreal, but
that doesn't mean that we blame someone for that. You can't run
these businesses blaming your management every time something goes
wrong. It's just not a realistic way to run things, and I certainly
don't feel like anyone has done anything wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure, we would prefer to be sitting here with Felipe today,
but he's not here. So we just have to move on.'' &QL; 
No more battling &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Texas Rangers will no longer have to battle their All-Star
catcher,  &UR; Ivan Rodriguez, over playing winter ball. The
commissioner's office took the Rangers' annual headache away from
them last week.
</P>
<P>
   Citing an ``overuse'' clause in the working agreement between
Major League Baseball and the Latin American winter leagues,
players who have at least 250 at-bats in a big-league season are
ineligible to play winter ball.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez routinely went against the Rangers' wishes by
submitting himself to 40 or so additional games a year while
playing winter ball in his native Puerto Rico.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Roy Krasik, director of baseball operations for the
commissioner's office, said the clause was included to ensure
needed playing time for younger players and also eliminate demand
on older and more established players to participate in the
leagues.
</P>
<P>
   Veteran stars of the majors are often subjected to intense local
pressure to participate for their country in winter ball.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers constantly battled their star catcher, wanting him
to drop his winter ball games in order to rejuvenate for the
upcoming season. &QL; 
Mad dog or puppy? &QL; 
In his final post-season starts during his six-year career with
Atlanta,  &UR; Greg Maddux, generally considered the best pitcher of
this era, has yet to win in five attempts. (There were no playoffs
in 1994).
</P>
<P>
   In order, Maddux lost Game 6 of the 1993 NLCS to Philadelphia
and
 &UR; Tommy Greene; in '95 he lost Game 5 to  &UR; Orel Hershiser and
Cleveland before the Braves came back to win it all in Game 6; in
'96 Maddux lost the deciding Game 6 at Yankee Stadium, beaten by
 &UR; Jimmy Key.
</P>
<P>
   Last year Maddux lost to  &UR; Livan Hernandez and the Florida
Marlins in Game 5 and this season it was  &UR; Sterling Hitchcock and
San Diego beating Maddux in Game 3 of the NLCS. &QL; 
Lidle-ing on low &QL; 
The first player to be with both the Diamondbacks and Tampa Bay
Devil Rays, pitcher  &UR; Cory Lidle, didn't necessarily leave Arizona
with a good taste in his mouth.
</P>
<P>
   Lidle, who may never pitch for either club, was claimed by the
Devil Rays two weeks ago when the Diamondbacks tried to slide him
through waivers to their minor league roster, not an uncommon move
with an injured player.
</P>
<P>
   The Diamondbacks wanted Lidle, who first suffered through
shoulder pains before succumbing to ligament damage in his pitching
elbow.
</P>
<P>
   Everything was fine, he said, until he decided to go for the
more radical approach to fix his elbow, ligament replacement
surgery or as it's become more commonly known, `` &UR; Tommy John''
surgery. The Diamondbacks, he said, wanted him to take a more
conservative approach.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was kind of weird because I had some negative vibes from
the Diamondbacks organization once I made the decision to have
surgery,'' Lidle said. ``Before that I felt like part of the team.
But after the surgery they made me feel like I wasn't part of the
team. It was a 100 percent turn and I'm happy to get away from
there.'' &QL; 
THE HIT LIST &QL; 
 &UR; Strap yourself in for some wild times: New Colorado Manager  &UR; Jim
 &UR; Leyland has a career 5-18 record as a visiting manager at Coors
Field. His depleted Marlins won just one of six games at Coors
Field this season.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; From the useless information department.: The San Diego Padres
are the only professional club in the U.S. whose name is entirely
made up of Spanish words.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Flashback (World Series umpire edition): Larry Barnett.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; What happened?: Cleveland outscored its opponents, 101-63, in
the first inning during the regular season. In 10 post-season
games, the Indians were outscored, 17-3, in the first inning. &QL; 
EXTRA BASES &QL; 
Because San Diego has advanced to the World Series, the Colorado
Rockies will receive an additional player from the Padres in
exchange for pinch-hitter  &UR; John Vander Wal, who helped the Padres
quite nicely down the stretch and in the postseason.
</P>
<P>
   Cleveland was attempting to become the first club since the
1922-'23 New York Giants to oust the New York Yankees in
consecutive postseasons. The Giants did it to the Yankees in the
first two of their record 35 World Series appearances.
</P>
<P>
   New York Mets Manager  &UR; Bobby Valentine now trails only  &UR; Jimmy
Dykes (2,962 games),  &UR; Paul Richards (1,837) and  &UR; Jimmy
 &UR; McAleer (1,658) on the all-time list of managed games without ever
having his club finish in first place. Valentine, who moved into
fourth on the list, has managed 1,541 games for Texas and the Mets
without winning a title.
</P>
<P>
   Toronto's former Cy Young Award winner,  &UR; Pat Hentgen, received
wonderful news last week during his visit to Alabama orthopedist
 &UR; James Andrews: No surgery is needed on Hentgen's ailing right
shoulder. He will continue rehabilitating the shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   The Cincinnati Reds coaching staff will remain the same for the
1999 season with one small, but not insignificant, change.  &UR; Ken
Griffey Sr., will switch from hitting coach to bench coach,
swapping spots with  &UR; Denis Menke, who most of the hitters
gravitated toward anyway. Griffey wants to manage and this should
help him get there quicker.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 30 pitching coaches only two are non-pitchers. St. Louis'
 &UR; Dave Duncan, generally considered among the very best, has been
joined by Colorado's  &UR; Milt May, who like Duncan is a former
catcher. &QL; 
THE RUMOR MILL &QL; 
The Chicago Cubs are mulling their biggest questions of the
off-season, what to do with closer  &UR; Rod Beck and outfielder
 &UR; Henry &UR; Rodriguez. Beck has the right to refuse his option and
Rodriguez is a free agent. Both want to be Cubs in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   In an attempt to keep the sharks away, sources indicate Seattle
has made a three-year offer to reliever  &UR; Mike Timlin worth
somewhere between $9-$10 million. So far, there has been no
response from Timlin's side.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners have apparently also made a multiyear deal offer to
former Rockies Manager  &UR; Don Baylor, who would become Seattle's
hitting coach. Baylor is also mulling offers to remain in Colorado
as a vice president or join San Francisco's coaching staff, where
he would be teamed with longtime friend  &UR; Dusty Baker.
</P>
<P>
   Expect the San Francisco Giants to have the smallest payroll in
the NL West, which is quickly becoming the closest division to the
spend-like-crazy American League East. Los Angeles could be around
$75 million with Colorado ($60 million), San Diego ($55 million)
and Arizona ($45 million) all ahead of San Francisco, which says it
will be in the $40 million range.
</P>
<P>
   It should become official within a matter of months, but
Cincinnati managing general partner  &UR; Marge Schott should be
completely out of the Reds organization soon. Schott plans to sell
her piece of the Reds and the current limited partners are expected
to snatch up her stake.
</P>
<P>
   If  &UR; Joey Amalfitano, who spent the past 18 years coaching third
base for Los Angeles, is not asked to return, he figures to retire
rather than take a job in another organization. &QL;

HOW THE DAILY EXPERIENCES STUDY WAS CONDUCTED
</HEADLINE>
   (SIDEBAR to DAILYLIFE) 
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   To better understand life in our times, researchers for the
National Study of Daily Experiences called 1,500 Americans in 48
states, including 20 Arizonans, and asked them to talk about their
day.
</P>
<P>
   The participants were paid a token $20 each to do interviews on
eight consecutive evenings.
</P>
<P>
   Previous research on daily stress has relied on small samples of
subjects who kept daily diaries.
</P>
<P>
   The telephone surveys were designed to last 10 minutes, but they
often lasted longer because people had so much to say and wanted to
talk.
</P>
<P>
   Participants were asked about stressful events, feelings and
moods, achievements, health, habits, patterns of giving and
receiving help, and perceptions of daily productivity at home and
work.
</P>
<P>
   Some interview questions:
</P>
<P>
   Did you have an argument or disagreement with anyone today?
</P>
<P>
   Did anything happen at work or home that most people would
consider stressful?
</P>
<P>
   Did anything happen to a close friend or relative that turned
out to be stressful to you?
</P>
<P>
   Did you have any health problems?
</P>
<P>
   How much time, money or emotional support did you give to others
today?
</P>
<P>
   Did you have a productive day at home? At work?
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the week, they were asked, ``In the past week, how
of the time were you sad or blue?''
</P>
<P>
   The interviewers were 20 graduate students in social work from
the University of Michigan. The interviews were conducted in 1996
and 1997, and extensive analysis was performed during 1998 by 20
University of Arizona students and researchers.
</P>
<P>
   The National Study of Daily Experiences is part of a larger
10-year study on midlife by the MacArthur Foundation Research
Network on Successful Middle Adulthood. It is backed by the
Chicago-based John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation, which
is funding a series of studies on the stages of human development.
</P>
<P>
   The MacArthur Foundation is one of the nation's 10 largest
foundations, funding research and education programs on a wide
variety of subjects. It is popularly known for its ``genius
grants.'' &QL;

COOL OPENING WEEKEND BENEFITS QUAIL HUNTERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BARRY BURKHART  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Cooler weather has made an already good quail season
more attractive to hunters.
</P>
<P>
   Hunter reports from last weekend's opening of the Mearns and
scaled quail seasons indicate generally good results.
</P>
<P>
   As predicted by Arizona Game and Fish biologists, some of the
best quail populations were found in slightly higher elevations on
either side of a line drawn from Prescott to Payson to Globe to
Safford and then to Willcox.
</P>
<P>
   Hunters found good numbers of quail in those areas, although the
populations were spotty in others.
</P>
<P>
   Good reports came from the Tonto Basin and Oracle area.
</P>
<P>
   The Kingman area or the west also produced some good reports,
and hunters shouldn't forget the lower desert.
</P>
<P>
   Hunters reported some good shooting to the north and west of
Phoenix. Those heading north should be aware that no shooting is
allowed around Lake Pleasant. Lake Pleasant Regional Park, now part
of Peoria, is a no-hunting area.
</P>
<P>
   Nearby areas, though, have good populations of quail, according
to hunter reports received by phone calls and e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   As the daytime temperatures continue to fall, hunters won't be
confined to morning and evening shooting. Quail also will be more
active during the middle of the day.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the quail are small because some were hatched into
August. Later in the season these birds will be larger, thanks to
good seed crops, and should make hunting even better.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, that won't make walking the draws and foothills
any easier for those who aren't in shape. &QL; 
Fall colors slow &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Those who drive the mountains each fall to see the fall colors,
especially the spectacular aspens, should be aware that fall is
arriving late.
</P>
<P>
   Two weekends ago, some aspens in the coldest areas had begun to
turn red, but in lower areas, huge numbers of flowers still were
blooming.
</P>
<P>
   Large quantities of precipitation last winter and spring has
kept everything lush for the time being.
</P>
<P>
   There also has been good production of acorns and pinon nuts, a
boon to wildlife.
</P>
<P>
   Black bears usually come to lower elevations to eat prickly pear
fruit at this time of year. But biologists said the food supply is
so good at higher elevations in such places as Tonto Basin that the
bears have had no need to seek prickly pears. &QL; 
Poaching in mountains &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Game and Fish officers are seeking information regarding the
poaching of two bull elk in late September just north of Williams
near Espee Road.
</P>
<P>
   Officers said one elk was shot and left. The quarters and
backstraps had been removed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Someone knows who did this, and where the meat is,'' said
officer
 &UR; Bob Birkeland. ``These are just the kinds of acts that take elk
permits away from the sportsmen.''
</P>
<P>
   A reward of up to $350 is being offered for information leading
to the arrest of those responsible. Call the Operation Game Thief
hotline at (800) 352-0700. Callers can remain anonymous and still
receive the reward.
</P>
<P>
   Game and Fish also is setting up roadblocks through October and
November in the Flagstaff area during the big-game hunts.
</P>
<P>
   The roadblocks will be established on secondary roads to check
for wildlife violations. The department hopes the blocks also act
as deterrents. &QL;

ARIZONA FINDS ITS FOOTING AGAINST OREGON STATE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By NORM FRAUENHEIM  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   CORVALLIS, Ore. _ Arizona re-discovered an old friend Saturday.
It wasa happy re-union. A timely one, too.
</P>
<P>
   The Wildcats found some old traction after several weeks of an
aerial dance that had gone from dynamic to dangerous to
one-dimensional.
</P>
<P>
   For a while, it was fun. But gravity finally came knocking, and
the Wildcats were smart enough to heed its call. If they hadn't,
there would have been only a fall.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the Wildcats landed firmly on their feet with a 28-7
victory over Oregon State.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona's victory came on Parker Stadium's plastic turf. But
there was nothing artificial about the way the No. 16 Wildcats (6-1
overall, 3-1 Pac-10 Conference) accomplished it.
</P>
<P>
   It was almost old-fashioned. It wasn't exactly grounded in
pre-flight, fear-of-flying fashion. With receivers Jeremy McDaniel
and Dennis Northcutt, theWildcats' roster is always engineered for
aeronautics.
</P>
<P>
   And, sure enough, both McDaniel and Northcutt figured in a
21-point victory that halted Arizona's traumatic tumble nine days
ago in the 52-28 loss to UCLA days.
</P>
<P>
   But more about them later. Probably much more. Their impact
promises to be heightened later in the season by what Arizona
displayed against the Beavers (4-3, 1-3 Pac 10).
</P>
<P>
   Believe it or not, Arizona's aerail circus has a running game.
No clowns, either. Leon Callen, Trung Canidate and Kelvin Eafon are
a three-sided package of speed, misdirection and power.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was pivotal that we establish a running game,'' said
Arizona coachDick Tomey, who before this season had been known for
a ground-first, air-maybe philosphy ``I was very concerned about
this game.''
</P>
<P>
   Tomey's worries were justified. In some rival scouting reports,
the Wildcats were being written off as a one-play act. Stop the
pass, stop them.
</P>
<P>
   But against the Beavers, Arizona had more rushing yards than
passsing, 228-to-140. It was the first time this season that the
Cats have gained more on the ground than through the air.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew going in that running was our challenge,'' said
Arizona quarterback Keith Smith, who added that all of last
Tuesday's practice was devoted to re-establishing a ground attack.
``If we couldn't run the ball, this game and the rest of the season
might have been trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   Arizona's intent was most evident in the game's only scoring
drive of the second half. The Wildcats covered 74 yards in nine
plays with the touchdown capper a 36-yard dash by world-class
sprinter Callen, who finished with 107 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Only one play was a pass attempt _ an incompletion from Smith to
Nortcutt. For the only time in the game and the season, neither
Northcutt nor McDaniel played a promint role in an Arizona scoring
drive.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was almost strange, just standing there with Jeremy,''
Northcutt said. ``It was like: `Wow, we're scoring while me and
Dennis haven't caught a big pass.'
</P>
<P>
   ``But it was as good as it was strange. Down the line, it's
going to pay dividends for me and Jeremy. When defenses have to pay
more respect to our running game, we'll have more room to
operate.''
</P>
<P>
   Fact is, McDaniel and Northcutt operated often and everywhere
throughout the rest of the Arizona victory, which was also a result
of some fundamental defense.
</P>
<P>
   Led by linebacker Scooter Sprotte and defensive end Mike
Robertson, Arizona forced the Beavers were into four turnovers, all
fumbles.
</P>
<P>
   Early in the first quarter, Sprotte forced Beavers tailback Ken
Simonton into a fumble that was recovered by Rafell Jones.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona capitilized when the versatile McDaniel threw a block
that sprung Eafon lose for a 34 yard run. Seconds later, Eafon
flipped over Oregon State's defensive line for a 1-yard TD and
Arizona's first score of the game.
</P>
<P>
   Later in the second quarter, McDaniel baffled the Oregon State
secondary with a pattern that left him open for a 26-yard strike
from Smith. Northcutt followed with a 19-yard reception that set
the stage for another EafonTD, this time on a 4-yard run.
</P>
<P>
   Just before the half, Marcus Bell knocked the ball loose from
the graspof Beavers quarterback Terrance Bryant, who was injured in
the half's final moments. Daniel Greer recovered the fumble and
Arizona released the hounds.
</P>
<P>
   Four of Arizona's next seven plays were to Callen twice,
Canidate once and finally Eafon on a 2-yard TD.
</P>
<P>
   It was an old tactic and a new look for what the Wilcats hope is
another another victory run.

PHOENIX _ On any given day, about half the people in the waiting
room of the Family Practice Center at Good Samaritan Hospital are
middle-age people with illnesses resulting from daily stress.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Some have piled too many obli gations on their lives. Others
have been overwhelmed by circumstances beyond their control.
</P>
<P>
   ``A tremendous number of mid life illnesses are a result of
punish ing work environments and unbalanced living,'' said James
MacKenzie, a psychologist and the assistant director of the
hospital's family practice residency program.
</P>
<P>
   ``These patients have headaches, backaches, problems with their
di gestive system, or they are de pressed or suffering from anxiety
or fatigue.''
</P>
<P>
   Doctors often are trained to look only for biological culprits,
rather than the stress that surrounds our lives, MacKenzie said.
</P>
<P>
   But awareness is increasing. The six family practice programs
operat ing in Valley hospitals now have mental health professionals
on staff to work with doctors in treating illnesses that may be
emotionally based.
</P>
<P>
   Dig a little deeper into com plaints from people with insomnia,
and you often find that their difficulty is not biological. They go
to bed worried sick about whether they will still have a job next
week or anxious about their kids' prob lems at school.
</P>
<P>
   Worrying about health is itself a major stress for many
midlifers _ people ages 40 to 60.
</P>
<P>
   What complicates the health-stress issue, MacKenzie said, is
that many of the factors that make us happy also cause stress, such
as family life and an active lifestyle.
</P>
<P>
   Examples from the waiting room:
</P>
<P>
   A 45-year-old woman who runs 25 miles a week recently injured
her knee and had to stop running. Stress builds each day that she
can't be on the track. Running had become her sole strategy for
boosting her daily energy and feeling youthfully fit.
</P>
<P>
   Like other energetic midlife peo ple, she is working hard to
hold back aging, MacKenzie said. Exer cise is a proven way to do
just that.
</P>
<P>
   But at some point, MacKenzie suggests, the runner may have to
acknowledge that she can't com pletely outrun aging. She may have
to blend in less strenuous forms of exercise such as swimming or
yoga.
</P>
<P>
   A 48-year-old man has problems sleeping, as well as headaches
and muscle pains. No mystery: He's works 50 hours per week at a
factory, drives clear across the Valley twice a day, co-chairs his
church's annual fund-raiser and coaches two soccer teams. Plus, he
has begun freelance writing to earn extra college money for his
kids, he dabbles in the stock market, he has begun helping his
parents more, and he is buying a new house.
</P>
<P>
   It's not surprising that some people get ills, MacKenzie said,
it's surprising they're still standing. They're up to their ears in
obliga tions and are resistant to making changes.
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of books and tapes are available to help people calm
their lives by simplifying their routines, but many of the
recommended changes may not work for most people.
</P>
<P>
   Suggestions not to go clothes shopping for six months or to give
up your car or get rid of the television set are not necessarily
forehead-slapping great ideas, ac cording to MacKenzie.
</P>
<P>
   Telling a person to relax more means nothing to someone with
serious responsibilities who may have never relaxed in his or her
life.
</P>
<P>
   A noontime fitness class might relieve tension for one person
but prove more stressful for another who dislikes group activities
or has to juggle a tough schedule just to fit it in. That person
may not have the patience for a yoga class.
</P>
<P>
   Solutions that work vary from person to person. An introvert may
need more private time. An extro vert may need something more
vigorous, such as an aerobic work out. The hardest thing, MacKenzie
said, is to find out what works for you.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; MacKenzie has patients who can run multimillion-dollar
businesses yet struggle with remedying their unsatisfying, hectic
personal lives.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes he poses the miracle scenario: If you went to sleep
tonight, and if all your problems were gone in the morning, what
would your life be like? What would you do with your time? How
would you design your life?
</P>
<P>
   If you really know where you want to go, you can move slowly but
surely into that life, he said. The point is to get people to not
let today's stresses chew away at them, but to step back and
address the kind of life they really want.
</P>
<P>
   MacKenzie asks people to make a list of things they want to
change in their daily life. He then tells them to pick the one
thing they feel is most achievable, then do a couple of things
about it today or tomorrow to move in the right direction.
</P>
<P>
   And don't worry if you fall after a few steps. Like a toddler
testing new legs, you just have to keep trying, he says.
</P>
<P>
   In summary, the main way to reduce stress is to regain control
over your life.
</P>
<P>
   But MacKenzie and others agree it ain't easy. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPE, Ariz. - He stands alone at practice, in street clothes,
periodically catching the eye of a former Arizona State teammate.
Without a word, Larry Johnson is screaming, ``Look at me!''
</P>
<P>
   They do. And maybe it scares them. Because several are a
heartbeat away from being him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want them to know it can always get worse,'' Johnson said.
``You've got to take responsibility and keep your heart and mind
set on what you want to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's my whole purpose for being here. It's not for me. I can
watch them on TV.''
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, Johnson was coming off the best season of his
career. He started ASU's final five games and was expected to be
the heart of an otherwise inexperienced group of linebackers in
1998.
</P>
<P>
   And then it got away from him.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson is the metaphoric face of the modern-day college
athlete. Their lives are complicated. When the demands of family,
athletics and school collide, something crashes and burns. For
Johnson, whose problems were compounded by an unlikely amount of
bad fortune, it was football.
</P>
<P>
   In the last year and a half, he lost a father he loved. He
fathered two sons. And he became academically ineligible to play
football his senior year, a season he hoped would catch the
attention of the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   ``At first it messed me up,'' Johnson said. ``I was at the point
of `Man, I have wasted my life.' I was disappointed in myself. `I
did all this and now I have nothing to show for it.' I just wanted
to go back home (to California).
</P>
<P>
   ``Then I thought, `Well, that's not a good decision because I
won't be any different than anybody else who later in life talks
about what they could have done.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson was one of three seniors whose academic ineligibility
hit the Sun Devils hard and may have contributed to their 2-4
start. Wide receiver Ricky Boyer is enrolled at Mesa Community
College and still has a redshirt season to use. Tailback Marlon
Farlow is out of school but is still living in the area to help
raise his young son.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson decided to go public with his story to explain why it
happened, and how he is trying to turn it into a positive.
</P>
<P>
   ``The important thing to know is that for all the
(distractions), I'm not using them as an excuse,'' he said. ``I'm
sure things happen in everyone's life. Maybe a few more things
happened in mine. But it really doesn't matter.''
</P>
<P>
   Early last year, Johnson lost a father and became one. Juggling
school, parenthood and football was difficult but he thought he had
a handle on it. When his grades started to slip, he had to enroll
at Mesa Junior College for his spring semester to regain his
eligibility. It was a setback, but he still felt in control.
</P>
<P>
   He became eligible and enrolled in summer school at ASU. Life
was growing increasingly difficult. Grades. Football. Son. He also
learned he was going to become a father again, with a different
woman.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Juggling) all that would be very difficult,'' said receiver
Creig Spann, who is the father of a five-month old daughter but
only takes one class once a week. ``It can be hard.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson knew he was on thin ice academically, but he thought
would make it. He had heard of other athletes surviving similar
predicaments. It would work out.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a common mindset,'' ASU Coach Bruce Snyder said recently.
``It's like the guy who passes a terrible accident involving a
drunk driver, shakes his head and then goes out that night and
drinks and drives. `It can't happen to me.' ''
</P>
<P>
   It happened to Johnson. He needed a 2.0 grade-point average to
be eligible for football. He had a 1.98.
</P>
<P>
   He was devastated. He had all the amenities ASU's Academic
Services Office makes available: tutors, advisers, career planning.
But ultimately, it was up to him to make sure he stayed out of
trouble.
</P>
<P>
   As complicated as his life was, he blames no one but himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's funny,'' Johnson said. ``Something Snyder had been saying
to me the whole time didn't make sense until that time: `It's up to
you to make sure things get done, taken care of. It's not going to
be as important to anybody as it is to you.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Even after the team left for Camp Tontozona in August, Johnson
held out hope that he might return to the football field. When it
became less of a possibility, he was devastated. His mother,
Tammie, was his strength.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to thank the Lord for her,'' he said. ``I was thinking,
`What do I have to show for all this?' and she said, `You can go
home and see what you have to show for it. A lot of people you know
aren't do anything. You've come this far, you can't quit.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson realized she was right. And although he wasn't eligible
to play football, he was still eligible to remain on scholarship.
</P>
<P>
   He has focused on school and is scheduled to graduate in May
with a justice studies degree. He lives with neither son (they are
19 months and 3 weeks old), he said he is trying to be a good
father and is involved in their lives. He still has aspirations of
playing in the NFL and continues to work out daily.
</P>
<P>
   And he occasionally stops by practice to tell his teammates to
avoid the mistakes he made.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've grown up,'' he said. ``I'm actually at a point where I
can sit back and say I'm proud of what I've done. I'm going to be a
good father to my sons. I'm not going to stop because I still have
a lot ahead of me.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Betsy Mosher, ASU's senior associate athletic director for
administration and compliance, ``It's great that Larry has stepped
up for those who don't come to those realizations until they are
seniors.''
</P>
<P>
   Boyer and Farlow, too, have acknowledged their mistakes. For
Farlow, the weight of playing sparingly for three seasons, and
fatherhood, complicated his life. Boyer hopes to make amends in
1999.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just going to keep a smile on my face,'' Johnson said.
``Because there aint no great story that didn't start out bad.'' &QL;

SAILER KICKS BAD KARMA
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BILLY WITZ  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ If UCLA goes on to win the national
championship, the Bruins will remember Saturday as the day they
nearly kicked it all away _ literally.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Sailer's 24-yard field goal lifted the No.2-ranked Bruins
to a thrilling 41-38 overtime win over Oregon. Yet, Sailer wasn't
jumping for joy afterward.
</P>
<P>
   As his kick sailed through the uprights at the north end of the
Rose Bowl, the Notre Dame High alumnus merely clapped his hands and
walked back toward the sidelines as his teammates mobbed each
other.
</P>
<P>
   Sailer, like many of the Bruins, didn't so much win the day as
survive it.
</P>
<P>
   He missed two field goals in the fourth quarter _ a 42-yarder
that was blocked and a 21-yard chip shot he missed on the final
play of regulation. He also knocked a kickoff out of bounds that
contributed to Oregon's last-minute, game-tying rally.
</P>
<P>
   ``The win has sunk in,'' Sailer said in a nearly-empty Bruins
locker room, an hour after the game. ``I guess it's hard to say I'm
proud. I think I'm just relieved.''
</P>
<P>
   The entire season has been this way for Sailer.
</P>
<P>
   He was an All-American punter and kicker last season as one of
the Bruins' best weapons, making 19 of 24 field goals _ including
15 in a row at one point _ and averaging 43.1 yards per punt.
</P>
<P>
   This season he has made just 3 of 8, including the game-winner
and a 25-yarder in the first half.
</P>
<P>
   Sailer has been troubled lately by a groin he strained two weeks
ago against Washington State and hasn't kicked in practice since.
He left the locker room Saturday with a bag of ice wrapped to his
right leg.
</P>
<P>
   He could have used one for his confidence, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not having the best season,'' said the senior. ``I was
struggling throughout the game.... I think one of the strongest
aspects of my mind is that I can block things out. I know I can
make that kick. It's just a matter of going out and doing it and
not worrying about what happened before.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a kicker you only get so many shots. It's important that
you take advantage of every chance you get. A lot of times a game
will rest on one kick or a couple of kicks.''
</P>
<P>
   Sailer had a chance to put UCLA ahead 34-31, but his 42-yarder
with 6:49 left was blocked by Anthony Martin.
</P>
<P>
   When Cade McNown hit Danny Farmer for a 60-yard touchdown pass
with 2:36 left that put UCLA ahead 38-31, Sailer sent the kickoff
out of bounds, handing Oregon the ball at its own 35. The Ducks
ended up tying the score at 38-38 on Akili Smith's 2-yard touchdown
pass to Damon Griffin with 22 seconds left.
</P>
<P>
   McNown's 53-yard Hail Mary pass to backup quarterback Drew
Bennett set the Bruins up at the 3-yard line with eight seconds to
play. UCLA coach Bob Toledo didn't use any of his timeouts, instead
sending the field-goal team on.
</P>
<P>
   Sailer, kicking from the left hash mark, missed left.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wasn't nervous at all,'' said holder Joey Strycula.
``That's the thing about Chris _ he's so cool. He just said, `I...
missed it.' Bless God, he got a second chance.''
</P>
<P>
   After UCLA's defense held Oregon on downs to open the overtime,
the Bruins took over at the 25-yard line and ran the ball five
consecutive plays, all between the tackles, to set up Sailer again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was going to take one more chance and kick it,'' Toledo
said. ``Chris Sailer is a fierce competitor and he knew he missed
one field goal and got one blocked and wasn't kicking good, but you
know, superior athletes rise to the occasion and he rose to the
occasion when we needed him to.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the first time UCLA has won a game with a last-minute
field goal since Louis Perez beat Oregon 9-6 in 1992. It was the
first time Sailer has ever won a game with a field goal.
</P>
<P>
   He may have won more than that.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our main goal is to compete for a national championship,''
Sailer said. ``I thought, `Did I blow it for this team?' All I care
about is that we won the game.''

CARDS COULD PARLAY RARE ROAD TRIFECTA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID CASSTEVENS  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. - Do you remember the last time the
Cardinals beat the Giants, the Redskins and the Eagles on the road
in the same year?
</P>
<P>
   Here's a hint:
</P>
<P>
   ``All in the Family'' was the top-rated TV show.
</P>
<P>
   Nixon waved goodbye.
</P>
<P>
   Jake Plummer was born.
</P>
<P>
   If you said 1974, give yourself a high five. That glorious
autumn 24 years ago the St. Louis Cardinals defeated the three
division rivals on foreign turf.
</P>
<P>
   Now, just maybe, the Cards will do it again.
</P>
<P>
   You begin with the fact the Cardinals are the most overdue team
in sports history. Also, this year the Giants are so-so. The Eagles
are terrible; the Redskins hopeless. To quote the banner in
Veterans Stadium, where last Sunday the winless Eagles and Redskins
collided, ``May The Worst Team Lose.''
</P>
<P>
   It did.
</P>
<P>
   Since the 1970 merger, the NFC East has produced 10 Super Bowl
champions. No other division claims more than five. But the balance
of power has shifted, dramatically. Now the NFC East is the
league's weakest division.
</P>
<P>
   The Dallas Cowboys (4-2) lead the pack. Emmitt Smith is having a
big year. But a Super Bowl team? Without Troy Aikman, the Cowboys
lost to Denver, 42-23. A week ago Dallas had to come from behind,
at home, to beat winless Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   Recordwise, the 3-3 Cardinals are next.
</P>
<P>
   Then come the Giants, Eagles and Redskins, a combined 3-15. If
the Cardinals ever hit the trifecta on the road in the same season,
this could be the year.
</P>
<P>
   First up, today, New York. After beating Washington in the
opener, the Giants have lost four of five. Jim Fassel's team is
ranked last in the NFL in total offense. Last week the Giants,
playing at home, fell hopelessly behind Atlanta before Kent Graham
_ remember him? _ replaced Danny Kanell at quarterback and directed
his team to a meaningless touchdown. Even though the Giants
secondary is banged up, the Cardinals are underdogs because they
almost never win at the Meadowlands.
</P>
<P>
   In November, Vince Tobin takes his team to Washington, two weeks
after the Redskins play here.
</P>
<P>
   Washington is off to its worst start in 34 years. ``We're 0-6
and no better than our record,'' said Redskins linebacker Marvcus
Patton. The team that spent $57 million on free agents Dana
Stubblefield and Dan Wilkinson is so bad that one local newspaper
wit suggested that the only question left for embarrassed Redskins
fans is:
</P>
<P>
   Paper or plastic?
</P>
<P>
   Washington has a minus-13 turnover count, worst in the NFL. Last
week the offensive line had five false starts and allowed six
sacks. Coach Norv Turner, who should be fired, has replaced
starting quarterback Trent Green with a player from his doghouse,
Gus Frerotte.
</P>
<P>
   Frerotte is the fellow who last year gave himself a concussion
by banging his head into a padded wall.
</P>
<P>
   Turner should activate Sonny Jurgensen.
</P>
<P>
   Philadelphia has several problems, one of which is scoring. The
Eagles, who lost to the Cardinals in Tempe (17-3), are averaging
only 11.5 points.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's not a big step from 0-5 to 1-5,'' said Ray Rhodes, the
only NFC East coach who has won a playoff game. ``We have a long
way to go.''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, Ray, you do. The Eagles, who are 0-11-1 in their past 12
road games, play in San Diego on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   According to the 66,000 Eagles fans who showed up last week _ a
testimony to the magic of football in that town _ the most exciting
moment occurred at halftime when the franchise honored former
Eagles great Tommy McDonald, a recent inductee into the Pro
Football Hall of Fame.
</P>
<P>
   During the ceremony, McDonald, 64, caught a pass, flipped the
ball into the air and caught it, galloped into the end zone, turned
a somersault, chest-bumped the goal post and happily saluted the
crowd.
</P>
<P>
   When Tommy came off the field and rejoined his grand kids, Bill
Cosby turned and asked, ``What would he have done if they had given
him a car?'' &QL;

<P>
   Surrounded by skinnier, younger people at the beauty salon where
she works and sees herself in the mirror all day, Connie Willford
wishes she hadn't stopped running a mile each morning.
</P>
<P>
   Connie, who turns 40 on Monday, does manage a 5:30 a.m. walk
with her sister and brother-in-law.
</P>
<P>
   But the mornings are crammed with too many tasks that pile up at
the moment when her teenage sons have to be taken to school and
work and she has to head to the Scottsdale salon, 20 miles away
from her south Phoenix home.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes she runs behind schedule, but it's not for lack of
trying. The family clocks are set a half-hour early.
</P>
<P>
   Once at work, she is constantly on edge about her performance.
Will the customer like the hairstyle? She's fairly new at
hairstyling and is still building a client base. But she loves what
she does. And cutting up with co-workers at the Vidal Sassoon salon
helps break the tension.
</P>
<P>
   Between customers, she will make some calls to ease the family's
upcoming move to a larger house down the street _ larger because
one of her parents might need to move in with them for health
reasons.
</P>
<P>
   She will work through the afternoon into the evening, wishing
she could be home when her kids get back from school.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Connie and her husband of 20 years, Jollie Willford, 55, are
parents of 15-year-old twins, Gabe and Seth, and 18-year-old Adam.
</P>
<P>
   She believes teenagers need their parents more than
grade-schoolers do. One of the twins used to call every afternoon,
if only to say that the other two boys were fighting. Recently, she
was so busy and short with him that now he doesn't bother to report
in, and she misses his voice in her day.
</P>
<P>
   She's home by 7:30, but many nights by that time, others in her
family have found their own dinner. She misses the dinner-table
conversations.
</P>
<P>
   Until three years ago she was a stay-at-home mom. The career is
nice, but she feels that each family member is living a different
life now, which saddens her.
</P>
<P>
   They don't go to movies together, like when the kids were
younger. The basketball hoop, once a neighborhood focal point,
stands unused most of the time.
</P>
<P>
   But the money from the extra career is necessary. Two more teen
drivers next year _ $2,000 extra for auto insurance. That and a
hundred other expenses.
</P>
<P>
   Jollie Willford is at work by 6:45 a.m. as a psychiatric
technician at the Arizona State Hospital. In the two decades he has
worked there, he has received a broken rib and bruised eyes. You
always have to be on the lookout, he said. He totally cuts off work
when he goes home.
</P>
<P>
   But he gets deep satisfaction from serving as a father figure
for some of the younger patients and from helping them to get hold
of their lives. He knows he has been responsible for more than a
few of them getting their lives together and moving back into
society.
</P>
<P>
   When he comes home from work, he sometimes naps on the couch to
relax. He picks up his high school boys from school and his
18-year-old working son from the warehouse _ the son he and Connie
are trying to get to enroll in community college.
</P>
<P>
   Jollie has taken on more of the household responsibilities since
Connie began her career, though he has always been the family
bookkeeper and budgeter. He misses her not being home when he gets
there. He lifts weights to shed stress and stay fit.
</P>
<P>
   Connie and Jollie, realizing they weren't seeing each other
enough, recently began ``dating'' again. On Wednesday nights they
go to a karaoke show while the boys attend a teen group at church.
</P>
<P>
   Connie says, ``I wouldn't trade my life for anything. . . . I
enjoy my kids. It's exciting to watch them grow up. Our marriage is
stronger. Going through these hard times has been good for us. We
are a family.'' &QL;

PATRIOTS FIRE SALVOS AS TUNA BOWL NEARS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE SCHOENFELD  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   They split the Tuna Bowls last year. Monday night is the rubber
match, with New York Jets Coach Bill ``Tuna'' Parcells going back
to New England to play his former team, a game being billed as
``Jihad with the Jets III.''
</P>
<P>
   Pete Carroll, who replaced Parcells as coach of the New England
Patriots, says the game will be a ``circus.''
</P>
<P>
   At least, nobody has done what Patriots defensive back Lawyer
Milloy did a year ago when he said he wouldn't mind getting a
chance to rush Parcells and knock down the coach.
</P>
<P>
   Carroll, who formerly coached the Jets, also wouldn't mind
getting a piece of the hefty coach.
</P>
<P>
   Carroll is upset with comments from Parcells in the off-season
that the Patriots overused running back Curtis Martin last season.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was the biggest crock,'' Carroll said of Parcells' remark
about Martin, who left the Patriots in the off-season to sign a
six-yer, $36 million deal with the Jets.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything he says is a crock. You might as well make a list.
He's just full of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin has stayed out of the fray, but his mother, Rochella,
said she expects her son to get booed Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to affect Curt, but I'm not going to lie to you,''
she said. ``I'm going to be fired up.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was time to take another route, and I told him to go. I
made the decision. I'm sure it was a tossup for him.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Parcells talked about psyching out Patriots
quarterback Drew Bledsoe last season. ``I think it got to him a
little, but it will be much different now,'' Parcells said.
</P>
<P>
   He also praised Patriots receiver Terry Glenn, whom he once
referred to as ``she.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a good player,'' Parcells said of Glenn. ``No one knows
that more than I do. He's a threat.''
</P>
<P>
   Glenn was not impressed and called Parcells' remarks
``sarcastic.''
</P>
<P>
   The Jets, 2-3, come into the game off an embarrassing loss at
St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   Parcells has benched starter Glenn Foley, 1-7 in his career as a
starter, and has gone back to Vinny Testaverde.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we don't do something soon, we're not going to be a
factor,'' Parcells said.
</P>
<P>
   Foley thinks he is being made a scapegoat.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of reasons that haven't been stated,'' Foley
said. ``There are a lot of things going on here. There are a lot of
things behind the scenes you don't know, a lot things you can't
know, things that can't be said.''
</P>
<P>
   Let the circus begin.
</P>
<P>
   ``Santa Claus is coming to town,'' Patriots cornerback Ty Law
said. ``Coach Parcells is coming back, and he's going to have his
boys ready.'' &QL; 
Savior or Satan?
</P>
<P>
   When New Orleans Saints Coach Mike Ditka claimed quarterback
Kerry Collins on waivers Wednesday, the ``New Orleans
Times-Picayune'' hailed him as the ``Next Best Hope.''
</P>
<P>
   Longtime New Orleans radio personality Buddy Diliberto described
Collins as a ``a gift from heaven.''
</P>
<P>
   Saints players weren't as excited about their new teammate, who
was viewed as quitting on the Carolina Panthers the previous week
when he reportedly told Coach Dom Capers that his heart wasn't in
it anymore, a statement Collins denies making.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody knows what really happened in the whole situation at
Carolina,'' Saints offensive tackle Willie Roaf said. ``Granted,
you don't leave your football team or walk out in that type of
situation. We had a coach do that a couple of years ago (Jim Mora).
I still respect Coach Mora, but you don't do that. I don't care how
bad it gets.''
</P>
<P>
   The Saints were the only one of the 30 teams to put a waiver
claim in for Collins. He becomes the fifth quarterback on their
roster.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not clairvoyant,'' Ditka said. ``Maybe we're the home of
lost souls. I don't know.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are guardian angels all over the world. They come into
your life for reason. And maybe we're going to be his guardian
angel. I hope so.'' &QL; 
Name calling
</P>
<P>
   Tampa Bay defensive tackle Warren Sapp, who plays Collins'
former team today, called Collins a ``coward'' and said Collins
``disgraced the game.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He disgraced Johnny Unitas and all the great quarterbacks who
have played the game,'' Sapp said. ``Archie Manning lived with New
Orleans through all the dismal years and came out each week and
gave his blood and guts. This guy comes out on a team and has a lot
of talent and a great coaching staff. He's the first pick in that
city's whole franchise, and he quit _ forever noted as the first
pick and the first quitter in the NFL. . . .
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't be with him for all the money in the world and all
the riches and gold and diamonds, either. If I saw him walking down
the street, just the sight of him would (anger me).
</P>
<P>
   ``For him to come in and say all of a sudden he doesn't believe
in the system or believes his heart isn't in it _ where was his
heart when they were going to the NFC championship game? That is
the ultimate slap and spit in everybody's face and the organization
and football in general, because he disgraced the game.'' &QL; 
Growing up
</P>
<P>
   Former Cardinals quarterback Chris Chandler said he became a
good NFL player the day he stopped being angry about being a backup
on so many teams.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is something (former Cardinals offensive coordinator)
Jerry Rhome told me all the time, that he knew that is what I was
always fighting, and it took me a long time to get it through my
head,'' said Chandler, who has led the Atlanta Falcons to a 4-1
record.
</P>
<P>
   ``As soon as I stopped trying to prove anything, right or wrong,
to anybody, and just try to have fun playing the game and play the
game for the game's sake, I was able to concentrate a lot more and
play better. But I fought that for a lot of years. I was a victim
of circumstances, but I let it affect me in a negative way, and I
didn't handle it right.'' &QL; 
Quick kicks
</P>
<P>
   Syndicated TV talk-show host Regis Philbin picked the Vikings
(5-0) in the preseason to reach the Super Bowl. ``I had my eye on
the Vikings when they added Randy Moss,'' Philbin said of the
rookie wide receiver. ``I said, ``That could be it _ three great
wide receivers, two great quarterbacks, a great running back.' What
else does a team need?''
</P>
<P>
   Collins' Carolina jersey cost $200 at a Phoenix sports apparel
store before he was released. It was on sale for $35 last
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Former Miami Coach Don Shula, the last coach of an unbeaten
team, thinks the Broncos (6-0) could duplicate his feat. ``I think
the Broncos have a chance to run the table,'' Shula said. ``The
thing that (Coach Mike) Shanahan does so well, offensively, is that
he's always coming after you and utilizing that great talent he's
got. And they have enough talent to do it because of that running
back (Terrell Davis). He's made them a different team now.'' &QL;

YANKS BEAT PADRES, 9-6  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Chuck Knoblauch and Tino Martinez were as popular as
squeegee men a week ago, the speculation rampant that one or the
other or both might be exiled if the Yankees' historic year
crumbled in the post-season. Two big hits in the midst of a big
inning changed all that Saturday night in Game 1 of the World
Series.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees trailed San Diego, 5-2, in the seventh inning, but
Knoblauch hit a three-run home run to tie the score, and five
batters later, Martinez smashed a grand slam. The seven-run
explosion rocketed the Yankees to a 9-6 victory in the opener of
the four-of-seven-game series, before 56,712 at Yankee Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Orlando Hernandez will pitch against Andy Ashby in Game 2 Sunday
night at the Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond seizing the advantage in the series, the Yankees were
able to neutralize the Padres' ace, Kevin Brown, driving him from
the mound in the seventh. Brown, seen by many as San Diego's best
hope for a World Series upset, will not pitch again until Game 4,
at the earliest.
</P>
<P>
   Brown was pitching with a three-run lead after the top of the
fifth, when Tony Gwynn and Greg Vaughn banged back-to-back homers.
One out into the seventh, however, Jorge Posada hit a single, and
Brown walked Ricky Ledee. Brown, who had thrown a whopping 64
pitches in the first three innings, went out, and the reliever
Donne Wall came in to face Knoblauch. This is what the Yankees have
done all season, force a starter from the game in the middle
innings, before exploiting a middle reliever.
</P>
<P>
   Knoblauch, of course, had earned notoriety for his gaffe in the
Game 2 of the American League Championship Series against
Cleveland, standing and waiting for an interference call as the
ball rolled to a stop behind him and the decisive run scored. The
Yankees came back to win the series, however; Knoblauch got a
reprieve and talked about how much the experience had helped him.
</P>
<P>
   Facing Wall with a one-ball, no-strike count, Knoblauch had to
duck under a runaway fastball. Two balls, no strikes. Wall had to
throw a strike, Knoblauch swung hard and lifted a high fly down the
left-field line. Off the bat, it did not look like much. But it
kept carrying, Vaughn drifting back in left and looking up, to see
the ball disappear into the stands. Tie game. Yankee Stadium shook.
</P>
<P>
   Knoblauch rounded the bases, crossed home plate and thrust both
arms into the air, yelling to the crowd, like a hyped Olympic
weightlifter who had just successfully hoisted a half-ton. He
stomped around the dugout, his helmet on, teammates banging on him
happily. When Derek Jeter singled, nobody really noticed. Wall left
the game, and Mark Langston took over.
</P>
<P>
   Paul O'Neill flied out, and after Jeter advanced on a wild
pitch, Bernie Williams was intentionally walked. Chili Davis drew a
walk. Bases loaded, once more, with Martinez coming to the plate,
with exactly one run batted in in his first 76 career at-bats in
league championship and World Series games.
</P>
<P>
   With the count two balls and two strikes, Langston threw a pitch
near the outside corner that he thought should have been a strike.
Instead, Garcia called it a ball. Langston glared, snapping at the
return throw. Langston and Martinez and everyone on the field now
understood that with the bases loaded and a 3-2 count, Langston
would have to throw what players refer to as a cookie _ a tasty
pitch over the middle.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez ate up this cookie. The ball soared into the upper deck
in right field, lifting three years of post-season misery off the
back of the Yankees' first baseman, a grand slam. The crowd called
out Martinez from the dugout again. Like Knoblauch, Martinez pumped
both arms, and later the crowd would chant his name, and Martinez
would wave his cap. San Diego's lead was long gone.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees had taken a 2-0 lead over Brown in the second
inning, forcing him to throw 32 pitches in the second. They loaded
the bases with a single and two walks, and Ledee, the rookie left
fielder who is playing because none of Torre's left fielders have
been hitting, pulled a sinking fastball down the right field line
with two outs. The fans along the foul line stood, some waving to
push the ball fair with the body English, and the ball landed on
the line, skipping off the wall as two runners scored. The Yankees
had the early edge, they had jumped on Brown, and they had their
best pitcher on the mound.
</P>
<P>
   San Diego's Chris Gomez led off the second inning with a blooper
over shortstop, the ball falling in for a single. Quilvio Veras
flied to right, Gwynn grounded out and Gomez took second, bringing
Vaughn to the plate. David Wells got ahead in the count, no balls
and two strikes, with a change-up and a fastball, before trying to
run a fastball inside on Vaughn, who hit 50 home runs during the
regular season.
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn attacked the pitch: a line drive that landed in the
second deck, foul all the way, but a frightening mistake. Jorge
Posada, the Yankees' catcher, jogged to the mound to re-think the
strategy, perhaps to remind Wells of the conventional wisdom: you
must pitch Vaughn on the outer edge of the plate.
</P>
<P>
   Posada returned to the plate, called for an outside fastball,
Wells threw. Vaughn's swing was short and quick, the ball making a
 &UR; click &LR;  sound off the bat, like a well-struck golf ball, before
carrying over the wall in right-center field. Tie game.
</P>
<P>
   Wells retired the first two batters in the fifth inning, before
jamming Veras with an inside fastball. Veras' bat snapped on
contact, but it was enough to send a looper into short center
field, a single.
</P>
<P>
   Gwynn stepped in, having hit a single in his first two at-bats,
and looked for a sign from the third base coach Tim Flannery. With
a runner on first, he likes to try to pull a ball through the right
side of the infield. Wells fired a fastball, Gwynn turned on the
pitch and ripped it, a line drive that crashed off the facing of
the upper deck in right field. The Padres jumped from the dugout,
celebrating, as Wells turned away, disgusted, asking for a new
baseball. He got one, delivered another fastball, and Vaughn
slugged this deep into the left field stands. Two pitches, two home
runs, the first back-to-back home runs allowed by Wells since April
30. San Diego led, 5-2, and Yankee Stadium was silent. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It would not stay that way.

TRADING PLACES: EERIE SIMILARITIES FOR BACKUP QBS  
 BROWN, GRAHAM KNOW OPPONENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By LEE SHAPPELL  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ It evokes images of the old Mad Magazine
Spy vs. Spy cartoons.
</P>
<P>
   Dave Brown, the Cardinals backup quarterback, used to be the New
York Giants starter until an injury opened the door last year for a
young quarterback (Danny Kanell) that the Giants organization
really wanted to play anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Kent Graham, the Giants backup quarterback, used to be the
Cardinals starter until an injury opened the door last year for a
young quarterback (Jake Plummer) that the Cardinals organization
really wanted to play, anyway.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals visit the Giants today. Brown and Graham are
saying nice things about each other and their former teams. But
imagine the counter intelligence that must have taken place this
week in their respective film rooms.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know that last year Kent was telling the defensive backs the
different audibles in Jim's (Giants Coach Jim Fassel) system,''
Brown said. ``I'm staying away from that. These guys on our defense
are playing so well right now why should I mess them up?
</P>
<P>
   ``But the wind in Giants Stadium certainly is something passed
down from every Giants quarterback. Phil Simms taught me, I told
Danny. I can tell Jake where the danger spots are in that stadium
and where not to throw it. One big thing, if you're smart about it,
is you can really play field position football. That's why they win
so many games there, because they really work the field.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown and Graham had been Giants teammates until Graham, tired
of being Brown's backup, came to Arizona in 1996. They faced each
other as starters that season in the Meadowlands, but it was
short-lived.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were supposed to have this big duel, but I got hurt in the
second series of the game and Kent got hurt in about the fourth
series,'' Brown said.
</P>
<P>
   Graham said they remain friends although ``we really haven't
talked that much because I don't have his phone number. But I think
our relationship is still real good.''
</P>
<P>
   Graham started the first six games for the Cardinals last season
_ until he was knocked out by the Giants. Stoney Case was the
starter the following week. Case was relieved by Plummer. And the
rest is history.
</P>
<P>
   As was Graham.
</P>
<P>
   Brown started the first five games for the Giants last season
until sidelined by a pectoral muscle strain _ the week the Giants
and their last-place offense came to Arizona. There, under the
direction of second year quarterback Kanell, they dominated the
Cardinals. And the rest is history.
</P>
<P>
   As was Brown.
</P>
<P>
   As free agents, Graham and Brown exchanged addresses during the
off season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought Vince (Tobin, Cardinals coach) did make an effort to
get me back,'' Graham said. ``But they wanted Jake to play, no
matter what. Jake had some real good games last year. I was caught
between a rock and a hard spot.''
</P>
<P>
   Fassel said the moves were best for both.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like Dave, I have a hell of a lot of respect for him,''
Fassel said. ``But when he was playing before he got hurt we
weren't playing very good as a team. As hard as it is, the best
thing for Dave was to go to a new city, get out from underneath
that, and revive his career. It's the same thing for Kent.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown has yet to take a snap with the Cardinals even though
Plummer has struggled. Kanell went belly up against Atlanta last
week so Fassel brought in Graham. Fassel quickly reaffirmed that
Kanell will start today.
</P>
<P>
   Graham was in a struggling offense with the Cardinals last year,
as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a big question as far as how to go into that,'' Graham
said. ``Our problems here are different. For the most part guys
know what they're supposed to be doing. We've just got to execute.
They're booing us here and there. That's the way it's been in New
York as long as I've been around.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown doesn't miss that.
</P>
<P>
   ``Giants fans expect and demand their team to play well,'' Brown
said. ``If it doesn't they're going to tell them about it. That's
one of the tough things about playing for that team. But those are
guys I played with for six years, guys I admire, guys I'm good
friends with. If it somehow comes down to Kent playing for them and
me playing for us, I think that's something we would both really
enjoy.'' &QL;

RICE MOTIVATED TO STOP GIANTS THIS TIME AROUND  
 FASSEL'S TEAM RAN AT HIM IN '97

<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ Maybe Jim Fassel deep inside knew he
could run at Simeon Rice, maybe he didn't.
</P>
<P>
   The bottom line is that Fassel's New York Giants did it
successfully last season. Twice.
</P>
<P>
   By Rice's own account, he did not have a banner year. He came in
with lofty expectations after his selection as NFL Defensive Rookie
of the Year in 1996. It started with elevation sickness that sapped
his strength. It was compounded by a shoulder injury that limited
his moves, and thus his effectiveness.
</P>
<P>
   The team dropped a succession of close early games and started
1-4. Yet only one foe had rushed for more than 100 yards against
it.
</P>
<P>
   Then Fassel and the Giants came to town, and Rice, playing
defensive right end, became a blocking dummy. The Giants' offense
was dead last in the NFL, but it rushed 46 times for 236 yards _
most of them directly toward Rice _ and cruised to a 27-13 win.
</P>
<P>
   That was the week the defense let go. And, some said, it was the
week that Rice was exposed as a questionable run-stopper. As the
season wore on, Tennessee, Pittsburgh, and the Giants again (40
rushes, 201 yards in a 19-10 win in the rematch in the Meadowlands)
enjoyed success running to Rice's side.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think a lot of things went into us running to our left more
than our right,'' Fassel said. ``Trust me, it wasn't because Simeon
was over there. It was our match-ups and where we were playing
better ourselves. I get more involved in what we're doing good.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet the perception was that perhaps Rice had been overrated as a
rookie. That's not the sort of thing that sits well with a
competitor, which Rice has come back this season and shown himself
to be.
</P>
<P>
   Were foes running at him?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know,'' Rice said. ``I do know that when it gets bad
for a person it can have a snowball effect. It's not like a
situation that heals itself quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   Rice is highly motivated to prove that he was not a ``one-hit
wonder'' who hauled in those rookie accolades two seasons back.
</P>
<P>
   He has supported his claim with 20 tackles, three sacks, eight
quarterback pressures, three pass deflections, and two fumble
recoveries to help the Cardinals rally from an 0-2 start to 3-3
going into their visit to the Giants (2-4) today.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals defensive line is becoming dominating with rookie
left end Andre Wadsworth playing like the third pick in the draft,
left tackle Eric Swann performing like a Pro Bowler again, right
tackle Mark Smith maturing into the tackles leader of the group,
and a healthier, stronger Rice redeeming himself. They're third in
the NFC in total defense and they lead the NFL with 19 takeaways.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals again catch the Giants when their offense down.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one thing to say you're going to run to your left, but if
our left tackle isn't playing good, it doesn't make any sense to
run to our left,'' Fassel said. ``Last year, Roman (Oben, Giants
left tackle) was playing good. Right now, I don't know where we're
playing good so I don't know which way to go.
</P>
<P>
   ``Each week you try to get a scheme that combines where we're
playing well and where we can attack either by formation or
direction. Right now, that's kind of difficult to figure out for
us.''
</P>
<P>
   Cardinals Coach Vince Tobin, having been burned by his former
offensive coordinator twice last year, is skeptical of Fassel's
praise.
</P>
<P>
   ``I find when they're getting ready to play you that the
opponent tries to set you up,'' Tobin said. ``They throw a lot of
smoke at you, make you think you're better than you are, and in
their own reality they think they're going to be able to come out
and whip you pretty good. I don't worry too much when people say
good things. That usually means they're going to attack a certain
area.
</P>
<P>
   ``When an offensive coach schemes, he is trying to utilize his
strengths but also go at what he perceives is the weakness of the
other team. In Jim's case last year, it was probably both. The
Giants dominated both games on the line of scrimmage last year. I'm
sure they're going to try it again.''
</P>
<P>
   This time, Rice is determined to show he belongs on the field
against Fassel's offense.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, I'm good,'' Rice said. ``I have a host of guys around me
playing really well. It's all good for me. It's one of those
situations where each individual is taking care of his
responsibilities and making it better for everybody.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things are going well. We feed off each other. Things are
happening for us, building for us. Individuals are getting better.
Our defense as a whole is getting better, becoming more dominating.
But you've got to prove that every time you go out. I look forward
to going out this week and proving my competing edge and nature.'' &QL;

ASU PUTS NEW SPIN ON ACADEMIC ASSISTANCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PAOLA BOIVIN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPE, ARIZ. - In an effort to prevent more academic casualties,
Arizona State's athletic department has shifted the emphasis of its
Academic Services program to personal responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest thing that's under construction is to let all
student-athletes understand we're an assist, but we're not going to
make the slam dunk for them,'' said Betsy Mosher, ASU's senior
associate athletic director for administration and compliance.
</P>
<P>
   Three ASU seniors _ tailback Marlon Farlow, wide receiver Ricky
Boyer and linebacker Larry Johnson _ were declared academically
ineligible before the start of the 1998 season. The administration
has acknowledged that retention has been a problem in recent years
and said it is taking steps to correct it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't had a bad system, but their whole assignment was to
keep kids eligible,'' Mosher said. ``Now our assignment is to give
the kids the greatest experience and for it to culminate with
graduation. If you're going to go pro, we want to you be as close
to graduation as possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``The other end of it is our student-athletes have to play a
role in that.''
</P>
<P>
   The program's face lift, as well as tougher university admission
standards, could help change the perception of a program not known
for luring many athletes with strong academic backgrounds.
</P>
<P>
   This was the first year incoming students were required to have
16 high school core class credits based on standards set by the
Arizona Board of Regents four years ago. The NCAA requires only 13.
ASU previously asked for 11.
</P>
<P>
   While the decision may prove to weed out more at-risk students,
it could make recruiting more of a challenge.
</P>
<P>
   ``You hear about other schools using that as a recruiting tool:
`You can't get in there, but you can get in here,' '' said Tim
Desch, ASU's director of admissions.
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, the Pac-10 has limited this season the number of
partial qualifiers an institution can take to four and an
individual sport can take to one.
</P>
<P>
   A partial qualifier is an athlete who qualifies in only one area
of the NCAA's sliding scale of entrance exam score and grade-point
average.
</P>
<P>
   Partial qualifiers currently on ASU's roster include cornerbacks
J'Juan Cherry and Courtney Hysaw, linebacker Terrelle Smith and
defensive tackle Che' Britton.
</P>
<P>
   ASU has always provided academic assistance for its athletes,
including the use of tutors, counselors and computers. But the
focus, Mosher said, has changed from keeping athletes eligible to
making progress toward graduation and taking responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   ASU recently put in place a ``freshman-sophomore team'' that
will help underclassmen understand the concept. A graduation team
also is expected to be in place next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not that the services aren't here,'' Mosher said. ``It's
that we've tried to put a different spin on those services.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, who has visited football practice to encourage
teammates not to follow his path, is testament the new spin may be
needed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just want to help the young guys because that's something I
didn't have,'' he said. ``I didn't have someone to say to me, `This
is what you've got to look forward to. Be ready.' '' &QL;

MCNABB SHOOTS DOWN EAGLES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL VEGA  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; BOSTON _ For a fleeting moment, there was a spark. A smidgen
of hope. After Boston College suffered a total flameout in the
first half of Saturday's 42-25 loss against a red-hot Syracuse team
and its white-hot quarterback, Donovan McNabb, BC wide receiver
Anthony DiCosmo provided a glimmer when he caught a 32-yard
touchdown pass from quarterback Scott Mutryn that pulled the Eagles
within 10 points with 12:51 left in the game.
</P>
<P>
   All of a sudden, it appeared this CBS-televised Big East
showdown against the No. 23 Orangemen was a contest.
</P>
<P>
   But BC had no sooner scored its second touchdown of the game _
on a two-play, blitzkrieg strike that covered 54 yards in 16
seconds _ when Kevin Johnson rendered it no contest. In 18 seconds
flat.
</P>
<P>
   That's how long it took for Johnson to settle underneath a John
Matich kickoff, break a tackle by BC redshirt freshman Nick
Blevins, pick up a picket fence of blockers, and race up the
Syracuse sideline untouched for a 97-yard return for a touchdown
that deflated BC's sideline and silenced the Alumni Stadium crowd
of 43,413.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their kicker was doing an excellent job pushing me to the
sidelines,'' said Johnson. ``But on that play they sealed them to
the inside and I was only touched by one person. I made one guy
miss. I saw a little hole and no one was going to catch me after
that.''
</P>
<P>
   The Eagles, as a result, tailspinned to a .500 record (3-3
overall, 2-2 conference) with their third consecutive loss. It was
the second defeat in a row against a Big East opponent, following a
17-0 loss to Virginia Tech 10 days ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``This game today we just came out flat, but in the second half
we were ready to go,'' said BC senior running back Mike Cloud, who
carried 25 times for 104 yards and scored on a fourth-and-goal
plunge from the 1 _ BC's first TD of the month. ``We just made
mistakes and it just got us back into that slump again. When Coz
made that nice grab in the end zone, all our spirits on the
sideline were lifted right there and we were ready to go and we
were fired up.
</P>
<P>
   ``But when they brought it back and scored on that kick return,
it took the wind right out of us.''
</P>
<P>
   McNabb, the marvelous senior quarterback who appears to have
climbed back into the Heisman Trophy race by leading Syracuse (4-2,
2-0) to back-to-back victories after a hideous 38-17 loss at North
Carolina State Oct. 1, was equally breathtaking. He left BC's
defense sucking wind from the frustrating cat-and-mouse game he
played all afternoon. He constantly dodged and weaved his way past
BC defenders while pulling all the levers, pushing all the buttons,
and turning all the knobs of Syracuse's awesome offensive machine,
which rolled up 400 yards of total offense.
</P>
<P>
   ``The difference in the game is McNabb,'' said BC coach Tom
O'Brien. ``He gets out of those situations that are unbelievable. I
don't think he misthrew a pass in the first half. I don't think he
made a mistake in the first half.''
</P>
<P>
   McNabb on his own accounted for more than half of Syracuse's
offense (220 all-purpose yards) by completing 13 of 19 passes for
182 yards and a pair of TD passes of 12 and 29 yards to Jeff Lowe,
while rushing 11 times for 38 yards. And that's not counting the
amazing 95-yard scramble he had for no gain in the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Mutryn completed 11 of 20 passes for 199 yards but was
intercepted twice by Syracuse safety Quentin Harris, including a
flutterball intended for DiCosmo that Harris returned 63 yards to
help set up McNabb's first TD pass of the game.
</P>
<P>
   Kyle McIntosh gave Syracuse a 7-0 lead in the first quarter with
his first of two touchdown runs, a 15-yarder. Then Rob Konrad, the
former St. John's Prep standout, scored on a 21-yard TD run that
made it 14-0 with 5:11 left in the period.
</P>
<P>
   Matich converted a 36-yard field goal to put BC on the board in
the second, but the Orangemen came roaring back _ following
Harris's 63-yard interception return _ to take a 21-3 lead at
halftime on McNabb's 12-yard TD pass to Lowe.
</P>
<P>
   McNabb again connected with Lowe in the third on a dazzling
29-yard strike to give Syracuse a whopping 28-3 lead before BC
finally answered with an eight-play, 75-yard march that culminated
with Cloud's fourth-and-goal TD.
</P>
<P>
   DiCosmo's 32-yard TD catch gave rise to BC hopes, but Johnson
quickly dashed them with his kickoff return. McIntosh tacked on
another TD with a 23-yard run, but BC answered when Tim Hasselbeck
connected with Derrick Crittenden on a 19-yard TD pass with 2:22
left.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not a bad football team, and we're not a good football
team,'' O'Brien said. ``But we've got to be a perfect football
team. A team like (Syracuse) puts so much stress on us, and we were
just outmanned.''

BC'S EAGLES AT A LOSS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK BLAUDSCHUN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; BOSTON _ No mystery this time, folks. No talk of turning
points or key plays or might have beens.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, there could have been, of course, if you want to really
break down what happened in Saturday's 42-25 Syracuse romp past
Boston College at Alumni Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   But BC coach Tom O'Brien wasn't buying any of it. ``The bottom
line is that Syracuse is too much for us, they're just too good for
us,'' O'Brien was saying after the Eagles were run over by Donovan
McNabb and Company. ``It wasn't a good matchup for us. We lose.''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, they did. For the third straight time, which makes the
Eagles 3-3. With still another October loss, the Eagles are working
on their second season without a win in the first full month of
autumn.
</P>
<P>
   The question is, where do the Eagles go from here? Quarterback
Scott Mutryn had a direct answer: ``This team goes 4-3 next week by
beating Navy.''
</P>
<P>
   The Eagles should do that, of course. But before anyone gets
overconfident, let us recall Army 49, BC 7 on a dark and dreary
October afternoon three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The bottom line, as O'Brien might say, for the Eagles right now
is that there are no more gimmes on this schedule. Not Navy next
week and not even Pittsburgh next month, although the Panthers look
vulnerable after getting beat at home by Rutgers Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The question that O'Brien and his staff must ponder this morning
and the rest of this week is, do they make the journey with the
same starters? After another uneven performance by Mutryn Saturday,
a quarterback controversy could be brewing.
</P>
<P>
   At first O'Brien would have none of it, offering a simple ``no''
when asked if the Eagles might go to a ``younger'' look at QB,
meaning sophomore Tim Hasselbeck.
</P>
<P>
   A few minutes later, he conceded that the staff would make
evaluations before deciding, which is only natural and logical.
</P>
<P>
   O'Brien is in a tough spot. He has to juggle the present with
the future, while mindful of the past.
</P>
<P>
   Mutryn has been a spiritual warrior for the Eagles, embracing
the responsibility that comes with being a senior quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last week (the 17-0 loss to Virginia Tech) I felt that
everything was my fault,'' said Mutryn, who Saturday threw one
marvelous touchdown pass to Anthony DiCosmo and two
not-so-marvelous interceptions.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday's loss was not all Mutryn's fault. But he was a
contributor. So was the defense, which couldn't stop McNabb. So
were the special teams, which allowed a rally-killing 97-yard
kickoff return by Kevin Johnson, which turned a 28-18 game into a
rout.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, the Eagles won their first three games against
Georgia Tech (still the highlight of the season), Rutgers, and
Temple as a team, and now they are losing as a team.
</P>
<P>
   O'Brien can fiddle at quarterback, but there is no guarantee
that Hasselbeck will be any better than Mutryn. The coach also can
make some cosmetic changes on defense. But the bottom line is that
O'Brien doesn't have a lot of moves he can make.
</P>
<P>
   He is halfway through a season that could go anywhere from 5-6
to 7-4, which is what everyone sort of figured back in August.
</P>
<P>
   O'Brien says he is putting on blinkers and focusing on next week
as the key to success. After that, he will concentrate on Miami and
then on Notre Dame and week by week for the rest of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Game by game. ``We're 3-3,'' O'Brien said. ``Now comes the
challenge. We're halfway through the season, let's go find a way to
win. Let's find a way to win a game in October.''
</P>
<P>
   After that will come the challenge of November. O'Brien knows
what he has and what he doesn't have better than anyone.
</P>
<P>
   This will be a crucial week for the Eagles as they face their
most crucial game of the season.
</P>
<P>
   O'Brien said Saturday that the Eagles are neither a good
football team nor a bad football team. He is wrong. They are both.
What is frustrating for fans is that the Eagles sometimes display
characteristics of both in the same offensive or defensive series.
</P>
<P>
   O'Brien is smart enough to understand the ``if it ain't broke
don't fix it'' theory of coaching. But that doesn't apply to his
present circumstance. Offense, defense, special teams _ there's
plenty to fix and a diminishing amount of time to do it.
</P>
<P>
   O'Brien knows that if he can't do quickly, he must then start to
change his focus from this season to next. Changing quarterbacks
would be a sign that is happening.
</P>
<P>
   The Eagles aren't at that point yet. O'Brien hopes that time
doesn't come until recruiting season in December.
</P>
<P>
   But the signs the past three games have not been good.
</P>
<P>
   The bottom line is that BC football is broken right now and Tom
O'Brien has to find a way to fix it.
</P>
<P>
   Quickly.

CRAZY UCLA WIN LIVES UP TO HYPE
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA _ Amid the plays and the plots, the twists and turns,
the mistakes and the memories, some perspective to ponder:
</P>
<P>
   In a 15-game winning streak _ in a national championship drive
in a conference as rugged as the Pac-10 _ there will be games like
this.
</P>
<P>
   There will be games when the offense sputters and the freshman
tailback limps off and the defense bends and the quarterback throws
two interceptions and the star kicker misses a game-winner from 21
yards.
</P>
<P>
   Hey, they can't all be Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wow, that should be worth two wins,'' Bruins coach Bob Toledo
said Saturday after defeating Oregon 41-38 in overtime before
75,367 at the Rose Bowl. ``This was a pivotal game. We are in
control of our own destiny, and we needed to win. These kids are
very confident. They know how to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Trailing 31-24, the Bruins outscored Oregon 17-7 in the final 10
minutes of regulation and overtime _ culminating with Chris
Sailer's 24-yard field goal _ to extend the nation's longest
winning streak. In the single-elimination existence all Fiesta Bowl
contenders face, the No.2 Bruins (5-0, 3-0) have advanced to the
sixth round.
</P>
<P>
   Barely.
</P>

   ``If UCLA's the second-best team in the country,'' Ducks coach
Mike Bellotti said, ``then we're pretty damn close.''
</P>
<P>
   If anything, the game was eerily similar to UCLA-USC '96, the
double-overtime thriller with big plays and momentum shifts, a
late-game fumble, a desperation pass, an errant field goal and
relief in the home-team locker room.
</P>
<P>
   The list of Saturday's memorable plays and performances is
nearly endless, but here's the abridged version:
</P>
<P>
   Oregon tailback Reuben Droughns rushed for 172 yards but fumbled
three times.
</P>
<P>
   Bruins quarterback Cade McNown completed 9 of 13 passes for 202
yards and a touchdown !ital!after!off! vomiting late in the third
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA receiver Danny Farmer made seven catches for 161 yards and
two touchdowns, including a 60-yarder that gave the Bruins a 38-31
lead with two minutes left.
</P>
<P>
   Oregon quarterback Akili Smith threw for 221 yards and three
touchdowns. His last, to Damon Griffin, tied the game 38-38 with 22
seconds remaining.
</P>
<P>
   Sailer missed a 21-yard field goal at the end of regulation,
then made UCLA's first game-winner since 1992, when Louis Perez
beat _ you guessed it _ Oregon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish I could have ended it the first time,'' Sailer said.
``But I'm just glad the team gave us another chance and that the
coach and the team had the confidence in me to give me another
chance.''
</P>
<P>
   This was unlike any UCLA performance since the winning streak
began 57 weeks ago. Rather than methodically dispatching the
opposition _ converting turnovers, limiting their own mistakes,
grabbing a lead and building upon it _ the Bruins tried their best
to give it away. Of course, so did Oregon.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA jumped to a 24-7 lead and was driving for another touchdown
when the mistakes surfaced.
</P>
<P>
   First, Oregon intercepted McNown's screen pass to Brian
Poli-Dixon _ ``Bad call by the offensive coordinator,'' said Al
Borges, UCLA's offensive coordinator _ and scored with one second
left in the half.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of a 31-7 deficit, the Ducks were down 24-14 at halftime
and feeling good.
</P>
<P>
   They felt much better early in the third quarter, when
Poli-Dixon dropped a perfect touchdown pass: another opportunity
wasted.
</P>
<P>
   The Ducks responded with 17 consecutive points, grabbing a 31-24
lead early in the fourth quarter. Oregon's defense was as effective
as its offense. Stacking nine players on the line, the Ducks
contained UCLA's ground game and pressured McNown.
</P>
<P>
   ``We pounced on them, and then the offense died,'' UCLA
offensive tackle Kris Farris said. ``It was like we just turned
over and died. They were putting nine men in the box, and they
executed better than we expected. A lot of times, they knew what we
were doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Poli-Dixon regained his composure in time to snatch a 43-yard
slant from McNown midway through the fourth quarter. Two minutes
after Oregon had taken its first lead, the Bruins pulled even at
31-31.
</P>
<P>
   The Ducks were driving for the go-ahead touchdown when UCLA's
Pete Holland knocked the ball from Droughns _ his third fumble.
</P>
<P>
   Disgusted, Droughns head-butted the Oregon bench. Somewhere,
LaVale Woods cringed.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA wasted no time as McNown found Farmer for 60 yards on the
ensuing play, and the Bruins had regained the lead 38-31.
</P>
<P>
   A few minutes later, with Oregon facing a fourth-and-16,
receiver Damon Griffin corralled a deflected pass on the left
sideline for 19 yards. The Ducks had a final chance and, with 28
seconds left, Smith found Griffin for the tying touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-two seconds remained _ plenty of time for a 6-foot-5
reserve quarterback (UCLA's Drew Bennett) to make a 53-yard catch
and set up the winning field goal. Except it wasn't the winning
field goal. Implausibly, Sailer missed wide left from 21 yards.
</P>
<P>
   While Oregon rejoiced, the Bruins stayed calm.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it went into overtime, we didn't freak out,'' said UCLA
linebacker Brenden Ayanbadejo, who had two sacks as Oregon's
overtime possession lost yardage.
</P>
<P>
   Needing only a field goal, the Bruins ran on five consecutive
plays.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a great kicker,'' Borges said. ``I don't care if he
missed or not. He's a great kicker. We played for a field goal at
the end. We were putting it on Sailer.''

McNOWN LOSES LUNCH, WINS GAME 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA _ Cade McNown threw two passes to the wrong-colored
jerseys, slung two certain scoring passes that slipped through his
receiver's fingertips and tossed his pregame meal in front of a
crowd the size of Burbank.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, the UCLA senior quarterback has had better days. But
he hasn't had many better dusks than the one that descended on the
Rose Bowl Saturday shortly after McNown brought the No.2-ranked
Bruins' perfect season back from a near-death experience.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Sailer's foot ultimately put UCLA over the top against
Oregon, 41-38 in overtime. But make no mistake, McNown's guts were
the difference in the showdown of the Pacific-10 premier offenses.
</P>
<P>
   The nation's longest consecutive-game winning streak was
stumbling toward that bright, white light that beckons the dying
when McNown heaved a throw with just under three minutes remaining
in regulation that traveled 61 yards in the air and landed like a
feather in Danny Farmer's outstretched arms at the Oregon 5-yard
line. Farmer took it in for what amounted to a 60-yard play from
scrimmage to break a 31-all deadlock.
</P>
<P>
   Less than two minutes later _ all the time it took Oregon's
Akili Smith to counter with an 11-play, 65-yard scoring drive _
McNown heaved a 53-yard pass to backup quarterback Drew Bennett on
the first breath of the Bruins' last gasp. In the stands 75,367
souls were waiting to exhale.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps all that pent-up breath made the air too heavy for
Sailer, who inexplicably missed a 21-foot chip shot with 22 seconds
remaining to force the extra stress test.
</P>
<P>
   Of course McNown passed it with flying colors; never mind that
he was battling an upset stomach and an upset-minded Oregon team
that is so good it deserves to move into the top-10 despite the
loss.
</P>
<P>
   After the Bruins defense unflinchingly pushed the 11th-ranked
Ducks offense backwards in its first series in overtime, McNown
trotted out onto the field like he hadn't a worry in the world and
told his teammates, ``Let's just get it in here, OK?''
</P>
<P>
   Everyone nodded dutifully and no one got uptight that a 14-game
unbeaten streak, a Pac-10 crown and a national title were riding on
the next few plays. That's why McNown's teammates value him in a
way no Heisman Trophy voter possibly could appreciate. When he's
with them in the foxhole, it doesn't seem quite so claustrophobic
and chilling.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew,'' said offensive tackle Kris Farris, ``he was going
to find a way to win the game for us.''
</P>
<P>
   McNown did better than that. He arranged things so the Bruins
(5-0, 3-0) could preserve their winning ways and at the same time
save Sailer's self-confidence from the ledge it had crawled out on.
</P>
<P>
   McNown handed off thrice to tailback Keith Brown and twice to
fullback Craig Walendy to move the ball to the Oregon 6. It was
Sailer's spotlight from there and he was basking in it after
splitting the uprights with a 24-yard field goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have tremendous faith in Chris,'' said McNown.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, McNown possesses a spiritual center so sturdy he didn't
even think to treat sophomore split end Brian Poli-Dixon like a
leper after Poli-Dixon dropped a perfectly-thrown 40-yard strike on
the Bruins' first series in the third quarter that would have
broken the game open at 31-14.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can go ahead and say it. I dropped an easy ball,'' said
Poli-Dixon, who also let a scoring opportunity slip through his
hands in the fourth. ``I just wanted to get off the field. I was
disgusted with myself.''
</P>
<P>
   Late in the third McNown had a disgusting moment of his own,
stopping in mid-bark to barf. He left the field for one play, only
because the rules required him to, then returned to complete nine
of his final 13 passes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cade was very sick,'' said the Bruins' third-year head coach
Bob Toledo. ``He was throwing up in the locker room. He was weak,
but he made big plays.''
</P>
<P>
   Those plays included a 43-yard strike to Poli-Dixon early in the
fourth that set up the 2-yard run by Jermaine Lewis to tie the game
at 31.
</P>
<P>
   From remorse to redress. Poli-Dixon wasn't ashamed to admit that
on this day Sailer wasn't the only one thanking McNown for second
chances.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really easy to jump on someone's back for what they did
wrong but this team's not like that,'' Poli-Dixon said. ``I had a
horrible game and Cade didn't rip me. He just kept telling me to
shake it off. He's got a lot of heart and character.''
</P>
<P>
   That's why McNown should get a lot of Heisman votes even though
he has a good-but-not-God-like 54-percent completion rate and five
interceptions to go with his 10 touchdowns. McNown threw for 395
yards Saturday, which is the fourth-best single-game passing
performance in school history. But more impressively, he passed his
confidence on to his teammates when they needed it most.
</P>
<P>
   ``With Cade, you've got to look past his stats,'' Farris said.
``Without Cade McNown we wouldn't win this football game. Without
him, we'd be lucky to win three games this year. That's how
important he is.'' &QL;

 McNABB CAN'T BE NABBED  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PAUL HARBER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Syracuse quarterback Donovan McNabb had a plan going
into Saturday's 42-25 Big East victory over Boston College.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was to spread it around,'' said the Heisman Trophy
candidate. ``Let everybody get in on offense.''
</P>
<P>
   And that's exactly what he did. Statistics don't tell the real
story. Both teams had 20 first downs. Both teams had similar
offensive numbers: from total plays (BC, 65-60), to net yardage
(Syracuse, 400-370).
</P>
<P>
   However, it was McNabb that broke BC's heart early.
</P>
<P>
   For example, on Syracuse's opening drive, the Eagle defenders
has seemingly caught McNabb for a sack. But he somehow eluded them
and completed a 38-yard pass to Jeff Lowe for a first down. It set
the tone for the game.
</P>
<P>
   Just ask BC coach Tom O'Brien. ``The difference in the game is
McNabb,'' he said. ``He gets out of those situations that are
unbelievable. I don't think he misthrew a pass in the first half.
The guy's a magician.''
</P>
<P>
   The second time the Orangemen had the ball, BC twice had a
chance to force a Syracuse punt. Both times McNabb came up big,
leaving BC tacklers frustrated on the Astroturf.
</P>
<P>
   First, facing third and 9 from Syracuse's 26-yard line, McNabb
again eluded BC tacklers, and this time found Darryl Daniel for a
10-yard completion. Later in the series, McNabb faced third and 6
from the BC 48, and this time found a different way to keep the
drive alive as he ran the quarterback option for a 22-yard gain.
</P>
<P>
   North Andover's Rob Konrad made McNabb's handiwork pay off when
he rumbled 21 yards for the score.
</P>
<P>
   On the third and final TD drive of the first half, Syracuse was
faced with another third and 9, this one from the BC 12. Again
McNabb found daylight and hit Lowe with a 12-yard TD pass.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jeff and I worked out together during the summer with the rest
of the receivers,'' said McNabb. ``He did a great job catching the
football. I was scrambling and I just got away from the defense,
and he knew where I was going.''
</P>
<P>
   Added coach Paul Pasqualoni, ``Jeff made a play that is a
typical Quinton Spotwood play.'' Spotwood, sidelined with a knee
injury, was one of McNabb's favorite targets.
</P>
<P>
   The McNabb-Lowe connection clicked again early in the third
quarter as the duo hooked up on a 29-yard touchdown play that
essentially put the game away, 28-3. Again it was on a third-down
(and 15) situation. And again McNabb avoided the BC rush and found
the junior wide receiver from Liverpool, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   While McNabb's statistics were far from exceptional (13 of 19
for 182 yards), he did involve everyone in the offense.
</P>
<P>
   McNabb ran the lead on the option, gaining 38 yards on 11
carries, but also taking the hit after tossing off to Kyle McIntosh
(15 carries, 103 yards, two TDs).
</P>
<P>
   He also divvied up the receptions among seven receivers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew what we had to do,'' said McNabb. ``I felt confident
that if we could separate the BC defense, we would win. I figured
if we kept BC off balance, keep them on their toes, we would have a
good chance. Anytime you can go into a team's home stadium and win
is a big win.''
</P>
<P>
   Much of what McNabb accomplishes never is reflected in the
statistics.
</P>
<P>
   For example, late in the game from the BC 36, McNabb couldn't
find a receiver and was under pressure. He bounced off a couple of
BC tacklers, was chased back to his 16-yard line, and still found
daylight to get back to the line of scrimmage. It was for no gain,
but McNabb must have run for 100 yards dodging BC pursuers.

 McNABB CAN'T BE NABBED  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM GREENIDGE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Time and time again, the Boston College linemen had him
in their sights. And time and time again, Syracuse quarterback
Donovan McNabb escaped.
</P>
<P>
   For four quarters Saturday, McNabb teased the Eagles' defense as
he completed 13 of 19 passes for 182 yards and two touchdowns in
Syracuse's 42-25 rout of its Big East rival before 43,413 at Alumni
Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   And he had fun every step of the way.
</P>
<P>
   ``He just knows what he's going to do,'' said BC nose guard
Chris Hovan. ``You think that you're going to tackle him and then
you don't. We wanted to make sure that he didn't run the ball; we
preferred that he throw the ball.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then again, he has so many threats, so many players to choose
from to pass the ball. We had him a couple of times, and things
just broke down with the rush.''
</P>
<P>
   Added defensive end Mike Willetts, ``You become cautious. You
become somewhat afraid after a while whether you're going to be
able to make the tackle. We held him somewhat last season, but this
time he came right at us. He learned.''
</P>
<P>
   Needless to say, the duo would second the consensus opinion that
McNabb is something special. The multitalented senior can beat you
in so many ways. He connected with seven receivers Saturday, and on
the rare occasion he couldn't find one, he'd just tuck the ball
under his arm and create, gaining 38 yards on 11 carries.
</P>
<P>
   McNabb's talent was never more evident than on Syracuse's second
drive of the second half. Third and 15? No problem. McNabb just
went for the score, hitting Jeff Lowe with a 29-yard TD pass.
Willetts gave chase to McNabb, but it was to no avail.
</P>
<P>
   ``I should have had him on that play,'' Willetts said. ``There's
not a better quarterback around. He can run and he can throw. He
always seems to find a way. And we kept bringing everything in
there to get him, but we couldn't get him. During our preparation,
we wanted to keep him in the pocket, but it didn't work.''
</P>
<P>
   McNabb always got the time.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you come in at him from four different directions and
there's one opening, he seems to always find that one opening,''
Willetts said. ``He'll find your weakness. You never get to the
guy. He's just too good. And as a defensive lineman, because I'm up
front, I'm not so much worried about his passing, but I had to be
careful of his running. He hurt us, playing a flawless game. He
always seems to make that big play when he has to, taking advantage
of your mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   And McNabb didn't waste any time geting started.
</P>
<P>
   First possession: 81 yards on 10 plays in 4:50, culminating in
Kyle McIntosh's 15-yard TD run.
</P>
<P>
   Second possession: 75 yards on nine plays in 2:40, culminating
on Rob Konrad's 21-yard TD run.
</P>
<P>
   And the rout was on.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's tough to give up 14 points and getting behind that many
right away,'' Hovan said. ``You can't allow someone to come out and
do that. You've got to stop them. You bring everyone at McNabb and
then you can't tackle him. And it's not just one thing with McNabb.
No question, he's the best quarterback I've ever played against.''

<P>
   DALLAS _ Recalling the events of the late fourth quarter
yesterday, SMU's Kelsey Adams figured it was all perfectly obvious.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were out there gettin' beat, going nowhere, and it was a
bad deal,'' he said, ``because we came out here to win this game
for Mr. Doak Walker.''
</P>

   So, in the manner of the late SMU legend who was honored in a
halftime ceremony, Adams saved the Mustangs in the last reel _
taking a pitchout and running 55 yards straight through TCU's
heart.
</P>
<P>
   The touchdown _ with 4:19 remaining _ lifted SMU (2-5, 2-2
Western Athletic Conference) to a 10-6 victory that knocked the
Horned Frogs (4-2, 2-1) out of a tie for the Mountain Division
lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were better than us on one play,'' said TCU safety Reggie
Hunt, ``but it was enough.''
</P>
<P>
   TCU coach Dennis Franchione, who had watched his team win four
games this season in similar fashion, had similar thoughts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, nobody knows better than us how important one play can
be,'' he said. ``This game was similar to those we won, except this
time it turned against us.
</P>
<P>
   ``A cat only has so many lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Before Adams' burst, the rainy day had been rather grim for the
Mustangs and their supporters among a soggy throng of 26,360 in the
Cotton Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   To that point, the Frogs led, 6-3, because Chris Kaylakie had
kicked two field goals while SMU's Roy Rios had missed three times
in four tries. On a day ruled by defense, the teams combined for
eight first downs and 140 yards in the first half.
</P>
<P>
   But with the Mustangs sitting at their 45, Adams, a former
Western Hills High School star, took a pitch, cut back through a
hole, ran through a tackle, veered right, and was gone.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seemed like they had overshifted to the right, away from
where I was going,'' he said. ``I saw the hole, bounced off
somebody, got a block, and I knew that was it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Frogs rolled back to the SMU 44, but the final pass from
Patrick Batteaux was intercepted by Donald Mitchell, and the
Mustangs ran out the clock.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was scrambling left and trying to throw,'' Batteaux said,
``and I just never saw the guy coming. This was not one of our
better days.''
</P>
<P>
   But for SMU's Mike Cavan, whose snake-bitten troops had lost
twice in overtime and again by five points at Wyoming last week,
the day was beautiful.
</P>
<P>
   ``God, we needed this,'' he said. ``We've been through so much,
and it just seemed like it would never end. But we stuck together,
and the thing I can say about these guys is they never gave up.
</P>
<P>
   ``And Kelsey just made a great run and did it for us.''
</P>
<P>
   So the Mustangs, who were knocked out of a bowl possibility last
year by an 0-10 TCU team, got some measure of revenge.
</P>
<P>
   Both offenses struggled most of the day, with linebackers Joseph
Phipps of TCU and Jason Simonton of SMU delivering several
drive-stopping hits.
</P>
<P>
   The Frogs broke out of a 3-3 tie on a third-quarter drive fueled
by Basil Mitchell's 65-yard run to the SMU 22, where Donald
Mitchell made a saving tackle. The drive stalled at the SMU 5, and
Kaylakie kicked a field goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I was gone,'' Mitchell said, ``but I just didn't get
it done.''
</P>
<P>
   Noting that his team is 2-2 in league play, Cavan said, ``This
gives us a lift and puts us back in it, and that's the way we'll
approach things.''
</P>
<P>
   As for TCU, Phipps said, ``This creates an obstacle for us. It
will be interesting to see how we respond.''

FROGS MAKE LONG WALK TO THE EDGE WITH LOSS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By WENDELL BARNHOUSE 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ Losses mean long walks. The worse the loss, the longer
the walk.
</P>
<P>
   SMU 10, TCU 6 was a bad loss for the Horned Frogs. Forget the
Oklahoma game that slipped away. Yesterday's bolt-out-of-the-blue
defeat was a Western Athletic Conference loss to a longtime,
down-the-road rival. It only counts as one loss, but it was a
doubleheader of a defeat.
</P>
<P>
   TCU came within five minutes of a 5-1 start. The Frogs came
within five minutes of overcoming an offensive blackout. TCU's
defense came within one play of winning the game.
</P>
<P>
   That's what made it a sad stroll. TCU coach Dennis Franchione
climbed the Cotton Bowl ramp to the Frogs' locker room, holding
hands with his wife, Kim. She looked dejected. Franchione's head
was down as he slowly trudged along with his silent team.
</P>
<P>
   The victories that get away cause the most pain, the most
sleepless nights, the most doubt.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure, they're disappointed they lost,'' Franchione] said after
talking to his team. ``They're supposed to be. I told 'em that it's
OK to hurt. If they didn't care, it wouldn't hurt.''
</P>
<P>
   When SMU's Roy Rios missed a 42-yard field-goal attempt with
7:09 remaining, it appeared that TCU would have just enough, would
find another way to win again. Franchione, though, intuitively knew
that his team's 6-3 lead was tenuous.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was just like the other games, it's been the same every
week,'' he said. ``They've all been tight and come down to the
fourth quarter.''
</P>
<P>
   On SMU's next possession, it took the Mustangs two plays to get
the game's only touchdown. So what happened on Kelsey Adams'
55-yard scoring run?
</P>
<P>
   ``It was an `iso' play,'' TCU defensive coordinator Gary
Patterson said. ``They started strong and brought the fullback
weak. He bounced it outside, we didn't get off the block, we missed
a tackle and he outran us.''
</P>
<P>
   Simple translation: SMU made the play, TCU didn't. ``You gotta
make plays,'' said Patterson, who took full responsibility for
Adams' run.
</P>
<P>
   For much of the gloomy afternoon, TCU's defense made the plays
it had been making all season. A Russell Gary blitz sack, a Shawn
Worthen tackle for loss, a pass defensed by Kendrick Patterson. The
Frogs frustrated the Mustangs, who missed three field-goals
attempts.
</P>
<P>
   But there is a fatal flaw in this TCU team. It can't move the
ball through the air. And that's not a criticism of quarterback
Patrick Batteaux, whose on-the-job training continues.
</P>
<P>
   SMU knew TCU was going to pass only when desperate. Mustangs
coach Mike Cavan admitted it. His team stacked the line of
scrimmage hoping to stop the Frogs' running game. Other than a
65-yard scamper off a draw play by Basil Mitchell, SMU's strategy
was successful.
</P>
<P>
   TCU rushed for only 146 yards and had an anemic 185 yards of
total offense. Batteaux completed seven of 14 passes for only 39
yards. His longest completion was a 20-yarder to Royce Huffman on
the Frogs' final series that ended with SMU's second interception
of Batteaux.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, the Frogs are a one-dimensional team. TCU is averaging
82.8 yards passing per game. Its next touchdown pass will be its
first.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know how much more we can do about it,'' Franchione
said of his team's passing attack. ``We work on it very hard. I
can't invent certain things, can't invent an arm. We know we've got
some limitations, but the fact we didn't run the ball very well
today was our biggest flaw.''
</P>
<P>
   TCU, in winning four of its first five games, had been playing
on the edge. Exhibit A is the fact the team has survived
offensively without a valid passer. The question Franchione must
answer is this: Will this loss push his fragile team over the edge?
</P>
<P>
   ``Being around this football team, I think we're going to
respond the right way,'' linebacker Joseph Phipps said. ``We're not
quitters. We've got our minds set to play hard every game. I think
we're stronger mentally than last year. It takes mental toughness
to come back from a game like this.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year's TCU team would have called it a season after the
Oklahoma loss. This year's team has exhibited considerable mental
toughness. Franchione pulled the Frogs back from the edge after
losing to Oklahoma. He'll need a repeat performance this week.

BEARS BAFFLED BY AGGIE TRICKS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MIKE JONES 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ Texas A&AMP;M coach R.C. Slocum, one of the great
sideline stone faces in college football, actually cracked an
expansive smile last night at Floyd Casey Stadium as he watched the
final seconds expire on a 35-14 victory against Baylor.
</P>
<P>
   And why not? The 10th-ranked Aggies (5-1, 3-0 Big 12) not only
artfully dodged what many perceived to be an upset bullet aimed
straight between their eyes after last week's upset of then-No. 2
Nebraska. They also caught the projectile between their teeth and
spat it harmlessly to the ground.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was really concerned about coming up here and playing this
game,'' Slocum confessed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone thought we'd have a letdown,'' said A&AMP;M quarterback
Randy McCown, who had a 2-yard touchdown run. ``But the guys came
back focused and intense. That says a lot about the maturity of our
team.''
</P>
<P>
   This was not the Aggies' normal day at the offensive office,
however, as they cracked the 28-point glass ceiling for the first
time this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We pulled out some stops,'' McCown said. ``We've been saving
them for the right moment. The coaches thought this was the right
moment, and they worked.''
</P>
<P>
   The Aggies turned in a business-as-usual first half and led
14-0. They then shockingly shed their three-piece suits for
Hawaiian shirts and baggy shorts. A&AMP;M scored second-half touchdowns
on a 61-yard reverse by wide receiver Chris Taylor, on a 17-yard
halfback pass from Sirr Parker to tight end Derrick Spiller and on
a 3-yard run by fullback Ja'Mar Toombs three plays after a fake
punt with less than two minutes to play.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those plays were all a credit to Baylor,'' Slocum said. ``We
had enough respect for them and how they had played that we knew we
couldn't just line up and hammer them. So we put in a few
wrinkles.''
</P>
<P>
   Bears coach Dave Roberts said, ``A&AMP;M is an excellent football
team. They are hard to defend and stop. They were more physical. I
think the best team won, but I'm proud of our team.''
</P>
<P>
   Quarterback Odell James came off the bench to spark the Bears to
a pair of second-half touchdowns, but Baylor never closed the
two-touchdown halftime gap.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor's 61-yard sprint broke the second-half ice. The play was
set up by Dante Hall's gains off the sweep. Hall carried 17 times
for 137 yards _ his third consecutive 100-yard game _ and scored on
a 38-yard run in the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
   On the reverse, Hall took a toss right and handed to Taylor
coming back the other way.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dante running the sweep gets the defense going the wrong way,
and here I come,'' said Taylor, who has 4.31-second speed in the
40-yard dash. ``Dante helped set that up. He gave me a good
handoff, \Rguard\S Cameron Spikes threw a great block, and then it
was just me and the last guy. I beat him to the end zone.''
</P>
<P>
   James rallied the Bears for a 72-yard scoring drive, but A&AMP;M
answered with an 80-yard march that ended with Parker's dead-on
toss to a wide-open Spiller. James hit Morris Anderson on a 29-yard
scoring play with 4:24 to play. A&AMP;M moved with the kickoff from its
30 to a fourth-and-six at its 45 _ and lined up to punt.
</P>
<P>
   But Shane Lechler pulled the double-cross, hitting safety Rich
Coady for 29 yards. Toombs gained 5, then 18 and then bull-rushed
into the end zone with 40 seconds left.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told coach Roberts we were not even thinking about scoring
on \Rthe fake\S,'' Slocum said. ``I just wanted to make a first
down because \Rthe defense\S was gassed, they had just taken the
ball right down the field, and there was enough time left that I
didn't want to get into a shootout deal. Then Ja'mar made the big
run and we ended up scoring.''
</P>
<P>
   Cause enough to break precedent.

STARS STUMBLE ON ROAD
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MIKE HEIKA 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ On a night when irony hung thick at the United Center,
Alexei Zhamnov's play was simply poetic.
</P>
<P>
   Zhamnov, who has struggled in his two seasons with the Chicago
Blackhawks and quickly was finding himself under the watchful eye
of new coach Dirk Graham, turned last night's game with the shift
of his life and helped the Blackhawks to a 4-3 victory against the
Stars.
</P>
<P>
   The loss was the first of the season for the Stars (2-1-1),
stopped their six-game unbeaten streak against the Blackhawks,
handed goalie Ed Belfour his first loss against his former team,
featured 36 shots by an opponent and _ quite possibly the greatest
irony _ was created by lackadaisical play on the Stars' part.
</P>
<P>
   ``They outworked us; there's no other way to say it,''
defenseman Craig Ludwig said. ``They outworked us all over the ice,
and especially in our own zone.''
</P>
<P>
   That was never more apparent than on the Zhamnov play. With the
Stars leading 3-1 and five minutes remaining in the second period,
the typically soft Zhamnov hustled to drag down Stars winger Mike
Keane on what appeared to be a sure goal and a 4-1 lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it was a penalty,'' Keane said of his foiled shot at
an open net.
</P>
<P>
   But no whistle was blown, and Zhamnov scrambled to his feet to
get to the offensive end of the ice, where he ended up slapping in
a rebound goal that ignited his team.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had total control of the game,'' Stars coach Ken Hitchcock
said. ``But we were very casual with our play. And once Chicago
sniffed it out, they really went after us.''
</P>
<P>
   The Stars were outshot 36-29, were outdrawn in the faceoff
circle, 41-38, were outhit 27-15, and seemed to shy away from the
physical play the Blackhawks wanted to dish out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even when we were up 3-1, I still felt we were being
outplayed,'' Stars defenseman Derian Hatcher said. ``We just did a
lot of things that we don't usually do as a team. Even defensively,
we were running around in our end _ and we never do that.''
</P>
<P>
   The Stars were yielding an average of 21.3 shots per game this
season and led the NHL last season giving up 23 shots a game. They
gave up 16 in the second period and 13 in the third to a Blackhawks
team that had been emotionally challenged by Graham before the
game.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars started the game perfectly by preying on the
Blackhawks' tendency to be overaggressive. Handed three power-play
opportunities in the first period, the Stars scored on two to take
a 2-0 lead. Darryl Sydor flicked a wrister through a Jere Lehtinen
screen for the first goal, and Lehtinen then put in an easy tap-in
off a Brett Hull rebound.
</P>
<P>
   At that time, the Stars looked like the team that led the NHL in
road points last season. Even after Hatcher took a hooking call
trying to stop the speedy Zhamnov and Zhamnov then set up Tony
Amonte for a five-on-three goal to draw within 2-1, the Stars
simply grabbed the two-goal cushion back on another power-play
goal.
</P>
<P>
   Hull got his first goal as a Stars player when he slam-dunked a
rebound for his third point of the game (a goal and two assists).
But Hitchcock said after that kind of success with the man
advantage (the Stars are 7-for-27), his team looked like it was
waiting to get on the power play.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our play five-on-five is not very good; it's not near good
enough,'' he said. ``You've got to give Chicago credit; they came
after us. But we gave away two points today on the road.''
</P>
<P>
   Zhamnov helped turn the table as he drew the Blackhawks to 3-2
heading into the third period. And Chris Chelios then tied the game
with a huge blast from the top of the right circle just 23 seconds
into the third frame.
</P>
<P>
   Five minutes later, the Blackhawks were working with six men on
a delayed penalty call, and Ethan Moreau chipped in a rebound past
a crowd of players in front of the net. It was the fourth goal
Belfour had allowed _ twice as many as he had given up in four
previous wins against his former team.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Belfour had a strong night. He stopped several
breakaways and gave the Stars a chance to tie in the third period.
</P>
<P>
   But a struggling Stars offense couldn't produce.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you work harder than the other team, good things happen.
And they outworked us tonight,'' Keane said. ``Usually we win by
outworking teams. Tonight, we didn't do it, and look what
happened.''

GORDON PUTS HALT TO OCTOBER SWOON
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHN STURBIN 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. _ The only elements slowing Jeff Gordon's
march to a third NASCAR Winston Cup championship are the occasional
rain shower, the occasional red flag.
</P>
<P>
   Even those distractions ultimately were not enough to keep
Gordon from his 11th victory of 1998, in the inaugural nighttime
edition of the Pepsi 400 at the Daytona International Speedway.
</P>
<P>
   The 160-lap race was reduced to a three-lap shootout after the
event was red-flagged to a stop for 36 minutes, 56 seconds because
of rain. When it resumed on lap 157, Gordon outlegged runner-up
Jeremy Mayfield and held off a last-gasp drafting dash by
pole-sitter Bobby Labonte to claim the first October victory in his
Cup career.
</P>
<P>
   With only three races remaining, Gordon took a major step toward
his second consecutive championship and third in four years before
an estimated 170,000 fans.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon began the night with a 288-point lead over runner-up Mark
Martin in the championship chase. Gordon's victory, combined with
Martin's 16th-place run, unofficially left Gordon 358 points up
heading into Phoenix International Raceway next weekend. Gordon
needs to finish only 32nd or better in the final three races to
clinch. Or, if he gains another 12 points on Martin at PIR, Gordon
will clinch next Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm certainly not seeing that happening,'' said Gordon, driver
of the No. 24 DuPont Automotive Finishes Chevrolet Monte Carlo.
``But we've got a really good car to take to Phoenix. We tested it
at Homestead (Fla). We want to go there and be a challenger to win,
like we do at Rockingham and Atlanta.''
</P>
<P>
   After Phoenix, the tour visits North Carolina Motor Speedway in
Rockingham, N.C., on Nov. 1 and concludes at Atlanta Motor Speedway
in Hampton, Ga., on Nov. 8.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just hope things don't turn around to the opposite side,''
said Gordon, who averaged 144.549 mph. ``We want to run good
whether we've got a two-point lead, whether we're two points behind
or whether we've got a 300 or 400-point lead.''
</P>
<P>
   Gordon led three times for 49 laps around the high-banked,
2.5-mile trioval, including the final 38. His margin of victory
over Labonte was 0.176 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last couple of weeks have been the best restrictor plate
engines we've ever had,'' said Gordon, who finished second to Dale
Jarrett in the Winston 500 at the 2.66-mile Talladega Superspeedway
a week ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want everyone to know this is October, baby,'' said Gordon,
who had been reminded all month that his team never had won a Cup
race in either October or November. ``Everybody said we couldn't
win in October. We said this is a July race run in October. My
hat's off to \Rcrew chief\S Ray Evernham. This thing handled like a
dream.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a big day for all of us.''
</P>
<P>
   The victory was the 40th of Gordon's career, and marked his 17th
consecutive top-five finish of the season. Gordon, 27, previously
won the 1997 Daytona 500 and the 1995 Pepsi 400, when it was run in
July. This race was scheduled to be run at night on the Fourth of
July weekend, but postponed when wildfires swept through the area.
</P>
<P>
   Following Gordon and Bobby Labonte across the finish line were
Mike Skinner, Jeremy Mayfield, Rusty Wallace, Terry Labonte, Ward
Burton, Ricky Craven, Ken Schrader and Dale Earnhardt.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jeremy and I worked very well. He tried to work with me (on
the restart) and I appreciate his help,'' Gordon said. ``I wasn't
sure we were going to be able to stay up there, especially with
Dale Jarrett, because he was strong.''
</P>
<P>
   Jarrett saw his bid for a second consecutive restrictor-plate
victory go awry when he cut a left front tire. Jarrett, driver of
the No. 88 Quality Care-Ford Credit Taurus, was running second to
Gordon on lap 148 when the problem forced him off the pace and into
the pits.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, seven-time Cup champion Earnhardt, who won the
season-opening Daytona 500 here in February, had his chances for a
Daytona sweep dashed by a pit mishap. Earnhardt, Jarrett and Bobby
Labonte all pitted for tires and fuel on lap 97. With 63 laps
remaining, all three were making what they hoped would be their
last pit stop.
</P>
<P>
   But Earnhardt, who had entered the pits running second to
Labonte, collected a stray tire from Labonte's pit stall as he
returned to pit road. The tire struck the center of Earnhardt's
front air dam, pushing it in and upsetting the car's aerodynamics.
Earnhardt returned to pit road on several occasions to have his
crew tape and pop-rivet a replacement spoiler onto the lower front
of the No. 3 GM Goodwrench Chevy. The work dropped him to as low as
22nd on lap 125, the last car on the lead lap.

YANKEES SPOIL PERFECT SCRIPT FOR GWYNN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It may have been the most perfectly executed
``rope-a-dope'' since Muhammad Ali suckered George Foreman with the
same strategy in the jungles of Zaire 24 years ago this month.
</P>
<P>
   San Diego's Tony Gwynn laid the trap.
</P>
<P>
   New York's David Wells supplied both the rope and the dope.
</P>
<P>
   But in this star-spangled season in which they can seemingly do
no wrong, the Yankees still found a way to win.
</P>
<P>
   The Yanks, trailing 5-2, nuked the Padres with a seven-run
seventh inning, capped by Tino Martinez's dramatic two-out grand
slam, and took an electrifying 9-6 victory in Game 1 of the 1998
World Series last night at Yankee Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   It was a sickening loss for the National League champion Padres,
who got two home runs from Greg Vaughn and Gwynn's tiebreaking
two-run homer in the fifth, had ace Kevin Brown on the mound and a
three-run lead after six innings and still couldn't put the Yankees
away.
</P>
<P>
   ``You hate to give up a 5-2 lead,'' Padres manager Bruce Bochy
said. ``This is something we're going to have to put behind us.''
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees' comeback turned what should have been the story of
the game _ Gwynn winning his mind games with Wells _ into little
more than an interesting side note, and pulled New York's burly
left-hander off the hook after he'd talked himself into a hot spot.
</P>
<P>
   It started Thursday when Wells, who had been virtually
unhittable in the postseason, did what a lot of others have done
and said way too much on Howard Stern's syndicated talk show.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't X-rated, but, oh how Yankees' manager Joe Torre wished
he could have hit the ``dump'' button before Wells' prediction that
the Yankees would win the Series in five games had gone out over
the airways and around the world.
</P>
<P>
   It is a baseball axiom that is as old as the game itself: You
don't kick sleeping bulletin boards ... or something like that.
</P>
<P>
   ``Harumph,'' Padres pitching coach Dave Stewart growled Friday.
Or words to that effect. ``We've already beaten five pitchers
better than him in the playoffs.''
</P>
<P>
   You can debate the names _ Shane Reynolds, Randy Johnson, John
Smoltz, Tom Glavine and Greg Maddux _ but not the sentiment. Well,
maybe ``you'' can. I know Stewart too well, thank you very much.
</P>
<P>
   It was Gwynn's turn to jabber on the eve of his first Series
appearance since 1984. To any reporter who would listen _ and there
were wave after wave of them _ the Padres' 38-year-old superstar
hitter Gwynn talked of how terrible he'd been so far in the
postseason.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got to quit trying to pull everything,'' he said, shaking
his head, ``and just take the ball to left field.''
</P>
<P>
   Was he setting Wells up?
</P>
<P>
   It's a moot point now, but it certainly looked that way when
Gwynn turned on a high fastball in the fifth, yanking it down the
right-field line and high off the Bud Light sign on the third-deck
facade.
</P>
<P>
   Gwynn's two-run homer snapped a 2-2 tie, and when Vaughn
followed with his second homer of the game, a solo shot deep into
the left-field stands, the Padres had a three-run lead, and Yankee
Stadium was virtually silent.
</P>
<P>
   That should have been it. After a 14-year absence, Gwynn returns
to Fall Classic and leads the Padres to a first-game victory. Cue
the credits. Sell the rights to the movie. Turn off the lights.
</P>
<P>
   But that's not how it works here in the Big Apple.
</P>
<P>
   This Series began against a typically Manhattan backdrop: Joe
DiMaggio, desperately ill with pneumonia in a Florida hospital;
Darryl Strawberry, home from the hospital after surgery for colon
cancer two weeks ago; owner George Steinbrenner, feuding with
baseball officials over who should sing the national anthem,
longtime Yankee standby Robert Merrill or Anthony-come-lately Tony
Bennett.
</P>
<P>
   Just your normal October ballgame at Yankee Stadium, in other
words.
</P>
<P>
   So we should have known Gwynn couldn't be the hero last night,
not in a season when the Yankees have been nothing if not magical.
</P>
<P>
   A limping Brown, who had taken a Chili Davis line drive off his
left knee in the second inning without even a flinch, had nothing
left in the seventh, giving up a one-out single to Jorge Posada and
a walk to Ricky Ledee.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was hurting more than he was letting on,'' said Bochy, who
hopes to get two more starts from Brown if the Padres can take this
Series to seven games. Bochy had no choice but to turn to his
bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees blow-torched it for seven runs, three on Chuck
Knoblauch's game-tying homer off Donne Wall and the final four on
Martinez's ``salami'' off a 3-2, two-out fastball from Mark
Langston.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew eventually I'd get a big hit and help this team win,''
said Martinez, who had been slumping throughout the postseason.
</P>
<P>
   Just like that a game the Padres had seemingly wrapped up as
tight as a burrito was gone, and the Yankees had taken a 1-0 lead
in the Series.
</P>
<P>
   Funny, but it already seems more like 3-0.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe ``The Dope'' was right after all.

VAN RAAPHORST SIDELINED
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   PULLMAN, Wash. _ It's not being called a case of nerves, but USC
quarterback Mike Van Raaphorst left the Washington State game in
the second quarter and returned to the locker room after repeatedly
vomiting.
</P>
<P>
   Van Raaphorst did not return to the field for the start of the
second half.
</P>
<P>
   It is the third time this year Van Raaphorst has experienced
stomach problems. He was up the night before the Purdue game with
an upset stomach and experienced vomiting during warmups against
Florida State.
</P>
<P>
   Although officials said he had food poisoning against Purdue and
stomach flu against Florida State, there have been lingering
suspicions that Van Raaphorst has been bothered by nerves on game
days.
</P>
<P>
   His performance certainly gave little impression that he was
ill. Van Raaphorst was 9 of 15 for 99 yards and a touchdown when he
left the game.
</P>
<P>
   Freshman quarterback Carson Palmer made one of his earliest
appearances of the season when he replaced Van Raaphorst with 6:41
left in the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
   It was Palmer's second chance to play in the first half. He also
played in the first half against Oregon State.
</P>
<P>
   Palmer threw a 2-yard touchdown pass to Lonnie Ford in the third
quarter that gave USC a 28-14 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Palmer's appearance was earlier than USC coach Paul Hackett
intended. Hackett had said he would keep the quarterback rotation
intact, which meant a third-quarter appearance for Palmer.
</P>
<P>
   Oregon time set: With ABC choosing to televise UCLA-California
next week, USC's game at Oregon on Saturday will begin at 3:30
p.m.and will be televised on the Fox Sports syndicate network,
which means the game will be shown on Channel 9 (KCAL-TV) in
Southern California.
</P>
<P>
   Bowl visitors: Two representatives from the Holiday Bowl
attended the game. The Holiday Bowl gets second choice among
Pacific-10 Conference teams, but could be selecting third if the
Fiesta Bowl were to take UCLA.
</P>
<P>
   Petroff returns: Although he was still a little sore, assistant
coach Larry Petroff made the trip to Pullman. Petroff was
hospitalized this week with kidney stones and missed all practices.
</P>
<P>
   Cusano sits out: Although he suited up, linebacker Mark Cusano
(sore thigh) did not play.

YANKEES SLAM LID ON PADRES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By T.R. SULLIVAN 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ San Diego Padres manager Bruce Bochy took heat in the
League Championship Series for using All-Star pitcher Kevin Brown
in relief. That was nothing compared to the second-guessing he'll
get for pulling Brown out as the starter in Game 1 of the World
Series last night.
</P>
<P>
   Bochy tried to turn a 5-2 lead over to his bullpen in the
seventh inning after Brown had thrown 108 pitches. But the move
turned into disaster when the Yankees' Chuck Knoblauch tied the
score with a three-run homer off Donne Wall, and Tino Martinez hit
a grand slam off Mark Langston. The homers sparked New York to a
9-6 victory before 56,717 at Yankee Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kevin pitched well,'' Bochy said. ``He did his job. We just
couldn't hold them with our bullpen.''
</P>
<P>
   The seven-run outburst allowed the Yankees to overcome the
Padres' muscle against David Wells, who gave up two home runs to
Greg Vaughn and another to Tony Gwynn. But Wells stayed around long
enough to get the victory, his fourth in four starts this
postseason. It also made him 8-0 in the playoffs in his career.
</P>
<P>
   ``Boomer has spoiled us the way he's been pitching,'' Yankees
manager Joe Torre said. ``He had good stuff. His location was just
awesome.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown took a 5-2 lead into the seventh, but couldn't handle the
bottom of the Yankees' order. Jorge Posada, the No. 8 hitter,
dropped a one-out single into right-center and then Brown walked
hitter No. 9 Ricky Ledee.
</P>
<P>
   ``We said before the inning started if he was scuffling, we were
going to get him,'' Bochy said. ``He gave it his best shot. All
these games, the bullpen's going to play a role and you have to use
them.''
</P>
<P>
   That was the point in which Bochy decided to pull Brown even
though 108 pitches is not a high number for a starter, especially
for the ace of a staff.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any time you get a starting pitcher out of game it's a good
thing, especially when it's Kevin Brown,'' Knoblauch said.
</P>
<P>
   Bochy brought in Wall, but the moved backfired. Knoblauch jumped
on a 2-0 pitch and crushed it down the line in left for his
three-run homer that tied the score at 5-5.
</P>
<P>
   After Derek Jeter singled, Langston took over for Wall, getting
Paul O'Neill to fly out, but he walked Bernie Williams and Chili
Davis. Martinez worked the count to 2-2, then took a pitch that
Langston believed was strike three. Umpire Richie Garcia said
otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it was down,'' Martinez said. ``He \RGarcia\S did a
great job all night being consistent.''
</P>
<P>
   Martinez, who had 123 runs batted in during the regular season,
but only one in the first two rounds of the playoffs, hit the next
pitch into the right-field seats for a grand slam.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was nice,'' Martinez said. ``I haven't been doing much and
we were still winning. I knew eventually I would come up with a big
situation and get a big hit to help us win. It's definitely a
relief.''
</P>
<P>
   The bottom of the order was also trouble for Brown when the
Yankees scored two runs in the second inning. Chili Davis lined a
ball off Brown's leg that went for a one-out single and Martinez
drew a one-out walk.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the ball off the shin affected him,'' Bochy said of
Brown. ``He wasn't saying anything, but I think it was there.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown struck out Scott Brosius, but walked Posada to load the
bases. Ledee then worked the count full before lining a double into
the right-field corner, giving the Yankees a 2-0 lead. Brown
escaped that inning by striking out Knoblauch.
</P>
<P>
   Brown then allowed only three singles over four scoreless
innings before running into trouble in the seventh.
</P>
<P>
   The Padres struck back quickly in the third when Vaughn smashed
an 0-2 pitch over the right-field bleachers for a two-run homer.
San Diego went ahead 5-2 in the fifth when Gwynn hit a two-run
homer to right and Vaughn followed on the next pitch with a home
run to left.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a tough one to swallow,'' Vaughn said of the loss. ``It's
very disappointing. We've got to keep fighting. We can't keep
down.''
</P>
<P>
   The Padres also got an unearned run off the Yankees in the
eighth, but Mariano Rivera pitched a scoreless ninth to close it
out.

YANKEES HAVE THE ANSWER 
</HEADLINE>
 SERIES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ They could have been wearing prison stripes as easily
as pinstripes, trapped as they were in their postseason misery.
</P>
<P>
   Chuck Knoblauch didn't think. Tino Martinez didn't hit.
</P>
<P>
   But pick the right time for atonement, like Game 1 of the World
Series, and amnesia is almost certain to follow. Nothing like a
three-run homer (Knoblauch) or a grand slam (Martinez) to wipe the
slate clean.
</P>
<P>
   Put them both in the same inning, as Knoblauch and Martinez did
Saturday night in Yankee Stadium, and you're not only welcomed back
in the house, you're given the keys to the city.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees, in a seven-run seventh-inning show of power,
squashed the San Diego Padres, 9-6, before a delirious crowd of
56,712.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you try to make up in this game for every time you strike
out with the bases loaded or make an error, the pressure would pick
up so much you wouldn't even be able to walk,'' Yankees manager Joe
Torre said.
</P>
<P>
   Down, 5-2, after the Padres did some flexing of their own _ two
home runs by Greg Vaughn, one by Tony Gwynn, all off Yankees
starter David Wells _ the Yankees tied the score on Knoblauch's
three-run homer just inside the left-field foul pole off San Diego
reliever Donne Wall.
</P>
<P>
   The magnitude of that moment barely had time to register before
Martinez trumped it with a grand slam into the third deck in right
field off Padres lefthander Mark Langston.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got so excited, I had a stomach ache,'' said Chili Davis,
who had drawn a full-count walk just before Martinez buried a
3-and-2 fastball.
</P>
<P>
   And just like that, memories shut off in five boroughs.
</P>
<P>
   Knoblauch chose to argue with an umpire rather than retrieve a
ball in play against the Indians in the ALCS?
</P>
<P>
   Martinez had a .135 (7 for 52) average with one RBI in 16
previous games in the ALCS and World Series, and Torre was hinting
at using the creaky Davis at first base in San Diego?
</P>
<P>
   Fuhgeddaboudit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a little smile on my face,'' Knoblauch said, ``because
Tino and I have been trying to pump each other up. I was probably
more excited when he hit his home run.''
</P>
<P>
   That sentiment traveled down a two-way street Saturday night,
according to Martinez.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know we've been struggling,'' Martinez said. ``When he hit
his home run, I ran out of the dugout as fast as I could. I said to
him, `It's behind you. Now you're going to have a great
postseason.'''
</P>
<P>
   The Yankee eruption came after Padres ace Kevin Brown departed
with one out in the seventh and runners on first and second
following a single by Jorge Posada and a four-pitch walk to Ricky
Ledee.
</P>
<P>
   Brown, who had given up a two-run double to Ledee in the second
when the Yankees seized a 2-0 lead, admitted afterward that he was
suffering from a sinus infection.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, when he lost two games in the World Series to the
Indians while pitching for Florida, Brown had a viral infection
that left him weak.
</P>
<P>
   This latest illness raises questions about his ability to pitch
three times in this Series, if it goes the full seven games.
</P>
<P>
   ``What are the chances of going through a whole season feeling
good without coming down with something?'' said Brown.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've thrown three World Series games, and I haven't been
healthy yet. It would be nice to see how that feels.''
</P>
<P>
   Wall, who relieved Brown, threw his first pitch about 55 feet.
Knoblauch had to duck from his second.
</P>
<P>
   The third was redirected toward the 318-foot sign in left, where
Padres left fielder Vaughn scaled the wall in a vain attempt to
bring Knoblauch's ball back to his side of the fence.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a pretty good feeling when I hit it,'' Knoblauch said,
``but I got a little worried when I saw Vaughn jump up on the
wall.''
</P>
<P>
   But the high anxiety belonged exclusively to San Diego. When
Derek Jeter grounded Wall's next pitch into center field for a
single, Padres manager Bruce Bochy went to Langston. He retired the
first batter he faced, Paul O'Neill, on a fly ball, but after
throwing a wild pitch, he intentionally passed Bernie Williams,
then loaded the bases by walking Davis.
</P>
<P>
   And for the first time this October, it was Tino's time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't done much,'' Martinez said. ``But we've been
winning. We got to the World Series. I knew eventually I'd come up
in a big situation and get a big hit to help the team win.''
</P>
<P>
   And so he did, and so he bounded out of the dugout to face the
crow chanting his name. Just as Knoblauch had screamed to the crowd
after crossing the plate.
</P>
<P>
   ``To have the whole place standing up, screaming, you just get
caught up in the emotion of the moment,'' Knoblauch said.
</P>
<P>
   Those are the moments that you truly wish to remember.

PITCHERS' DUEL FOILED BY HEAVY ARTILLERY 
</HEADLINE>
 COLUMN-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB RYAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Conventional Wisdom is off to a bad start in the 1998
World Series.
</P>
<P>
   CW held that Saturday night's Game 1 would be a veritable mound
classic. CW held that good hits, and perhaps even good swings,
would be as rare as palm trees on Seventh Avenue. CW held that the
Star of the Game would be either David Wells or Kevin Brown,
perhaps both.
</P>
<P>
   CW certainly did not foresee a 9-6 victory by anyone. And CW
certainly did not foresee a seven-run Yankee seventh inning
featuring home runs by Chuck Knoblauch, the leadoff man still
trying to live down a celebrated case of ALCS brain lock, and Tino
Martinez, a woeful 1998 postseason batter whom most Yankee fans had
probably wished to be manager Joe Torre's leave-out man.
</P>
<P>
   Knoblauch refused to frame his three-run tying homer off
reliever Donne Wall in terms of vindication. ``I tried to put that
play (i.e. the interference whine while the go-ahead run was
circling the bases) behind me when I stepped onto the field that
Friday night in Cleveland,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Tino really did have something for which to apologize. The
team had been lugging him through these playoffs, and he knew it.
``I haven't done much, but we got to the World Series, and I knew
that eventually I'd get a big hit to help the team,'' he said. His
big moment came with the bases loaded and two outs in a 5-5 game
against lefty Mark Langston. First he had to survive a close 2-2
pitch that the Padres will forever maintain was strike three but
that Tino insists was ``down in the zone.''
</P>
<P>
   Common sense dictated that an agitated Langston would come in
with a fast ball, and he did. This one was up in that zone, and
Tino sent it soaring into the third deck for the winning grand
slam. That's the way to break out of a slump.
</P>
<P>
   Now, on any pregame scale of 1 to 10, the suggestion that nine
earned runs and three homers would be surrendered by the starting
duo would have been somewhere around a one-half. But that was the
case by the Yankee seventh, when Knoblauch's three-run homer off
Wall saddled Brown with two more earnies to go with the pair he had
given up in the second on a Ricky Ledee bases-loaded double.
</P>
<P>
   Wells's mortality had been firmly established by the fifth. He
first ran afoul of Greg Vaughn in the third when the left fielder
hit a two-out, two-run opposite-field homer just to the right of
the 385-foot sign. His next jolt came when Tony Gwynn smashed a
pitch off the facing of the third deck with Quilvio Veras aboard in
the fifth. When was the last time in Series history such a rotund
batter hit a homer off such a rotund pitcher as the well-rounded
Mr. Wells?
</P>
<P>
   Gwynn had nailed a first pitch. That brought up clean-up man
Vaughn, who likewise zeroed in on a first pitch, driving it deep
into the left-field seats. Vaughn had made no secret of his
animosity toward the Yankees, who had turned him back like a
bruised grapefruit when he was traded to New York last year. The
Yankee claim was simple: Vaughn had a bad shoulder. He couldn't
pass the physical. He was your basic damaged goods. It turns out he
was so damaged that all he could manage for the Padres this summer
were 50 homers and 119 runs batted in.
</P>
<P>
   At 5-2 after five, it was no longer a pitcher's duel. It was
becoming more and more ``The Kevin Brown Show.'' For after
requiring 62 pitches to get through three innings (including 30 in
the second and 20 in the third), Brown appeared to be in a proper
groove entering the seventh. He had survived a first-and-second,
one-out situation in the fifth when he retired Derek Jeter and Paul
O'Neill on successive ground balls, and he had looked especially
sharp in the 1-2-3 sixth, which included a pair of strikeouts.
</P>
<P>
   Entering the seventh, he was sitting on that 5-2 lead and had
thrown 98 pitches. But the Padres' decision already had been made.
``If he scuffled at all,'' explained manager Bruce Bochy, ``he was
coming out. He had done his job.''
</P>
<P>
   After getting Scott Brosius easily to start the seventh, he
allowed a sharp single to right by Jorge Posada. When he walked
Ledee on four pitches, Bochy called on set-up man Wall, the man he
had passed over in San Diego last week in order to bring in Brown
as a reliever. That move didn't work, and this one didn't, either.
</P>
<P>
   Wall surrendered the tying homer by Knoblauch, then a single by
Jeter before being relieved by Langston, who promptly loaded the
bases and would have been yanked had not the next batter been
Martinez.
</P>
<P>
   On any pregame scale of 1 to 10, the thought that this man, of
all people, would hit a clutch, tie-breaking, late-inning grand
slam was approximately a one-quarter. Torre wasn't making any
Turnpike Joe Morgan-style ``I had a hunch'' claims of clairvoyance,
but he did say that Tino had (finally) had a nice batting practice.
``He had soft hands, and the ball was really flying off his bat,''
Torre pointed out.
</P>
<P>
   So there it is. The Yankees are now three wins away from
finishing with a great flourish what is arguably their most
wondrous season ever. CW would say that El Duque will beat Andy
Ashby Sunday night, but CW is probably off hiding in a closet
somewhere after last night's sorry performance.

   New York - In an instant, the opportunity was gone, the victory
a terrible mirage. In an instant, the neurons misfired in the
manager's brain, prompting a stroll up the stairs and a trip to the
mound.
</P>
<P>
   In an instant, the tone of the entire series swung like a wild
pendulum, as if King Kong plopped down on one side of the
teeter-totter.
</P>
<P>
   If the Padres never recover, if they turn into another chunk of
roadkill on one team's road to history, they will remember this
night. The night when the Midas touch disappeared and Bruce Bochy
finally pulled the wrong lever.
</P>
<P>
   The night he looked around at the boiling madness of Yankee
Stadium, chewed on the magnitude of a Game 1 on the road, pondered
a sticky situation that just might decide the World Series. The
night he opted for Donne Wall over Kevin Brown.
</P>
<P>
   ``We talked about it before the game,'' Bochy said. ``We said if
(Brown) struggles at all, we're going to take him out. He knew
that. He was ready to be out at that point.''
</P>
<P>
   Was he?
</P>
<P>
   Brown, owner of an amazingly resilient arm, a pitcher his
general manager called a freak of nature, had thrown 108 pitches
when his manager asked for the ball.
</P>
<P>
   Brown, the most intense competitor in baseball and a man full of
postseason pedigree, was yanked in favor of a guy who has had one
good season in the bigs.
</P>
<P>
   If I'm the manager, it's a slam dunk. I take my chances with
Brown staring down the moment, raising his game, snuffing out a
fire of his own making.
</P>
<P>
   Which is what great pitchers do.
</P>
<P>
   ``Brown had so much success in the postseason, it seemed like he
reached a point where he was unbeatable,'' the Yankees' Chili Davis
said.
</P>
<P>
   Granted, Brown planted the seeds for the disastrous seventh
inning, giving up a one-out single to Jorge Posada and walking
Ricky Ledee, the eighth and ninth hitters, respectively, in the
Yankees' lineup. Granted, Brown was suffering from a sinus
infection. Granted, he had taken a shot off the shin in the second
inning that may have limited his effectiveness.
</P>
<P>
   But before the mess started, Brown had retired six consecutive
batters, including a called strikeout of Bernie Williams and a
whiff of Tino Martinez. And on the night, he had allowed only one
hit with runners on base.
</P>
<P>
   ``Donne's been in that situation all year,'' Bochy said. ``All
year he's done a good job there. We kind of stayed with what got
you here, and we felt like Donne would get the job done.''
</P>
<P>
   Yeah, right. From a guy who spent six years in the minors before
earning his promotion. A guy making his first postseason appearance
in the Bronx zoo.
</P>
<P>
   Predictably, the Yankees seized the moment. Vilified for
brain-lauch against the Indians, Chuck Knoblauch lifted a pitch
that landed in the bleachers of forgiveness. And by the time he
rounded the bases, the pardon was official.
</P>
<P>
   Against Mark Langston, Tino Martinez lost the horns and a
growing label as playoff gag artist, crushing a grand slam that
sealed the deal.
</P>
<P>
   In an instant, Brown was gone, and so was the opportunity. Think
the sight of Wall didn't lift the Yankees' spirits?
</P>
<P>
   ``Absolutely,'' Martinez said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anytime you get a starting pitcher out of the game, it's a
good thing,'' Knoblauch said. ``Especially when it's Kevin Brown.''
</P>
<P>
   Had the Padres held on, they could've taken control of this
affair, exposing a New York rotation that is somewhat suspect.
After all, El Duque is a rookie. David Cone's arm condition is
always a concern this time of year. Andy Pettitte was a question
mark before his father underwent triple bypass surgery on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   In an instant, it all slipped away.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it's a wasted opportunity,'' Bochy said. ``Sure,
you hate to lose a 5-2 lead, and this is something we'll have to
put behind us. But we came out and played a good ballgame. The
seventh inning just got out of control.''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, it did. Largely due to a miscue that won't show up in the
boxscore. An error in judgment charged to the manager. &QL;

YANKEES ROLL LUCKY 7  
 7-RUN 7TH INNING EARNS GAME 1 WIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PEDRO GOMEZ  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ For six innings Yankee Stadium was an unusually
somber place to be. The partisan crowd of 56,712 sat mostly stunned
as their hometown heroes fell behind by three runs to San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   Then Chuck Knoblauch, as big a goat who has ever worn the Yankee
pinstripes one week earlier, connected on a three-run home run. The
Bronx was the Bronx again, cups of beer flying through the air as
pandemonium reigned.
</P>
<P>
   Five batters later, Tino Martinez muscled a grand slam into the
right field bleachers and the Yankees were the Yankees again,
pouring it on an opponent like they had done so many times during
their record-setting season.
</P>
<P>
   From that moment on the Padres could forget about it, their
chances of snagging a lead in the World Series were essentially
over. New York wound up walloping the Padres, 9-6, on Saturday
night.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every inning we were telling ourselves keep playing the game,
keep pushing and try to get some more runs across because they're a
great team,'' said Padres left fielder Greg Vaughn, whose two home
runs were the driving force behind San Diego taking a 5-2 lead into
the seventh. ``The game's not over until the last out is made. They
came across with some big hits.''
</P>
<P>
   The moment was especially sweet for the two Yankees _ Knoblauch
and Martinez _ who each endured a personal variation of the
notorious Bronx cheers during these playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Knoblauch was ridiculed by the New York press and fans after his
boneheaded play in the 11th inning of Game 2 in the American League
Championship Series against Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   Knoblauch's ability to impersonate a statue while arguing a play
with an umpire as Cleveland runners, including the tie-breaking
run, circled the bases made him the object of tabloid covers and
cannon fodder for radio talk shows.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was embarrassed for him,'' Yankees right fielder Paul
O'Neill said.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, all is forgotten now.
</P>
<P>
   ``In this game there are days up and days that are down,''
Knoblauch said. ``You have to face the facts, answer the questions,
be a stand-up guy and that's all you can do.''
</P>
<P>
   Martinez has also experienced a personal hell of his own,
languishing in a postseason slump that is basically three years
old. Martinez entered the night batting .167 with one RBI this
postseason, not very different from his postseasons the previous
two years.
</P>
<P>
   There was even speculation that Martinez, who has driven in at
least 100 runs in each of the past four seasons, would be benched
when the series shifts to San Diego and National League rules will
not allow the designated hitter.
</P>
<P>
   Yankees Manager Joe Torre opened up a potential controversy when
he said he would play Chili Davis at first base rather than the
outfield if he were to start him in the field in San Diego. Torre
quickly backpedaled on the issue but said the possibility existed
if Martinez remained unproductive.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't done much,'' said Martinez, who hit the 17th grand
slam in World Series history and the first by a Yankee since Joe
Pepitone's in St. Louis in 1964. ``I knew eventually I'd come up in
a big situation and get a big hit to help the team win. It's
definitely a big relief.'' Of course, it wouldn't be a World Series
without an element of disagreement and the pitch before Martinez's
game-winning home run served it up. Padres reliever Mark Langston
threw a knee-high fastball that definitely could have been called a
third strike, which would have ended the inning. But home plate
umpire Richie Garcia did not ring up Martinez.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was really shocked,'' Langston said. ``It's a big game and a
big pitch. Obviously I have to be able to push that aside and
execute the next pitch. I didn't do that. It was on my mind for a
split second.''
</P>
<P>
   The Padres can kick themselves all winter over this one,
especially since Yankees starter David Wells was not on top of his
game, allowing five runs on seven hits in seven innings.
</P>
<P>
   ``They kicked my ass,'' said Wells, who is 4-0 since the
playoffs started.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, though, it was the Yankees muscle doing all the
tail-kicking. &QL;

LEDEE ANSWERS THE CALL  
 SURPRISE STARTER CHARMS YANKS FANS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PEDRO GOMEZ  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Two weeks ago, Ricky Ledee was working out in Tampa
with dozens of other young Yankees prospects. Today he wakes up a
Yankee hero.
</P>
<P>
   ``Opportunities are presented, and they have to be taken,'' said
Ledee, who was the surprise starter in left field for Game 1 of the
World Series Saturday night. ``I know how big it is to play in New
York, how championships are important here.''
</P>
<P>
   Ledee, obviously a quick study in Yankees history, ingratiated
himself to the most fickle but loyal fans in baseball. His
game-tying double in the second inning off San Diego ace Kevin
Brown, a line drive into the right-field corner with the bases
loaded, made him an immediate man of the people.
</P>
<P>
   Ledee's journey to the World Series was a bizarre one. Only
after Darryl Strawberry was diagnosed with cancer in his colon did
Ledee find out he was being added to the Yankees postseason roster.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been amazing,'' said Ledee (pronounced Leh-day). ``I
didn't even know I was playing until (Friday). I figured it would
be Tim Raines because he's been around long enough to deserve
starting.''
</P>
<P>
   Ledee, a 24-year-old from Puerto Rico, was the one player the
Yankees were unwilling to let go of when they acquired Hideki Irabu
from San Diego last year. The Padres finally yielded and decided to
take Ruben Rivera instead.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, the Yankees were aware they may have a good player on
their hands.
</P>
<P>
   Left field has become a sort of hole for the Yankees, especially
since Strawberry's illness surfaced. New York Manager Joe Torre
rode the hot bat of rookie Shane Spencer for a while, but his
bubble seems to have popped.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew the place was going to be rocking,'' said Ledee, whose
father, Antonio, was a famous salsa singer who died in a car
accident when Ledee was 12. ``Everyone knows about all the famous
players and games that have been in this stadium. I just wanted to
do my part to help the team.''
</P>
<P>
   After his game-tying double in the second, one which came with
two outs, Ledee again got the best of Brown in the fifth inning,
hitting a sharp single to right field with one out.
</P>
<P>
   He also walked and scored during the Yankees' seven-run uprising
in the seventh inning and reached base again in the eighth when San
Diego left fielder Greg Vaughn dropped a fly ball from Ledee.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't matter what else happens the rest of the series, he
knows he can do that,'' Torre said. ``So I'm free to use him any
way I want.''
</P>
<P>
   Spoken like a great manager who just found himself a $100 bill
in the seat cushion of his sofa.
</P>
<P>
   ``He came up to me before the game and said, `Skip, I just
wanted to say thank you,''' Torre said. ``I said, `thank me? You've
earned the right. You're on the roster. I put you in the lineup.' I
was just pleased for him to do that and of course pleased for us
because it gives us another weapon.'' &QL;

USC WINS 42-14
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PULLMAN, Wash. _ All those USC fans clamoring for more of
freshman quarterback Carson Palmer got their wish Saturday night,
although it took an upset stomach to get him in the lineup ahead of
Mike Van Raaphorst.
</P>
<P>
   Van Raaphorst was forced to leave the game in the second quarter
after experiencing vomiting, and the Trojans' offense never looked
back.
</P>
<P>
   Palmer's appearance seemed to infuse the offense with
confidence, because the Trojans went on a 28-point scoring blitz
and defeated the Cougars 42-14 before 31,178 at Martin Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   If nothing else, the quarterback controversy should be
re-ignited for another week.
</P>
<P>
   More importantly, the Trojans (5-2, 3-1) picked up a critical
victory with their bowl hopes beginning to hang in the balance.
</P>
<P>
   And for once, they could thank the offense.
</P>
<P>
   The offense received a twin boost, with Palmer's early insertion
in the second quarter along with the return of tailback Chad Morton
from a bruised back injury.
</P>
<P>
   Morton gave the Trojans some much-needed elusiveness in the
backfield that had been missing the previous two games, when he was
sidelined. Morton gained 68 yards in 16 carries and scored a
touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   But Palmer was the key.
</P>
<P>
   Prior to the true freshman's appearance, the offense was showing
signs of its usual rut in the first half. It had produced just
seven points midway through the second quarter, with linebacker
Chris Claiborne responsible for another touchdown on an
interception.
</P>
<P>
   Coincidence or not, the offense woke up behind Palmer, just like
it had in several previous victories.
</P>
<P>
   On Palmer's second snap, Petros Papadakis raced 53 yards up the
middle to put USC ahead 21-14 in the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Palmer got more involved in the third quarter, throwing a 2-yard
touchdown pass from Palmer to tight end Lonnie Ford.
</P>
<P>
   Moments later, wide receiver R. Jay Soward broke the game open
on a 27-yard touchdown run off a reverse. Soward's score gave the
Trojans a 35-14 lead with 9:16 left in the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Palmer then completed a 67-yard pass to tight end Antoine Harris
that culminated with Morton scoring on a 6-yard run to give the
Trojans a 42-14 lead in the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the defense remained consistent, intercepting six of
quarterback Paul Mencke's passes, with Claiborne snagging two.
</P>
<P>
   USC can secure a bowl berth with two more victories, and would
be making its first bowl appearance since the 1996 Rose Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Prior to USC's 28-0 scoring run, it looked like the Trojans
would be in another struggle, even though the weather (46 degrees)
never posed a problem.
</P>
<P>
   As has so often been the case, Claiborne bailed out the Trojans.
He stole a pass intended for Love Jefferson and returned it 25
yards for a touchdown to give the Trojans a 14-7 advantage. It was
Claiborne's second interception return for a touchdown this season.
</P>
<P>
   The momentum from that touchdown evaporated, however, thanks to
the Trojans' penchant for silly penalties. USC lined up offsides on
the kickoff, and on the second try Washington State's Dee Moronkola
returned it 49 yards to the Trojans' 45-yard line.
</P>
<P>
   Six plays later, Mencke found Nian Taylor wide open on a 29-yard
touchdown pass to tie the game.
</P>
<P>
   Washington State (3-4, 0-4) wasted little time scoring to open
the game. The Cougars went 78 yards with tailback DeJuan Gilmore
going off tackle 35 yards for a touchdown and 7-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   USC struck back later in the quarter, as the offense finally
concentrated on throwing to senior receivers Billy Miller and Mike
Bastianelli. Miller caught two passes on the drive, then Van
Raaphorst found Bastianelli over the middle for a 32-yard gain.
</P>
<P>
   Three plays later, Van Raaphorst hit Soward in the corner for a
13-yard touchdown pass to tie the game, 7-7.
</P>
<P>
   It was almost remarkable the way USC focused on Miller,
considering he had just 16 receptions in the first six games.
Miller caught seven passes in the first half.

YANKEES RALLY TO WIN GAME 1
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY MATT McHALE  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Tino Martinez heard the boos and the rumors. They are
always louder in October.
</P>
<P>
   But so is the drama, and no matter how badly he has played this
postseason, no matter how many times he has been traded to make
room for Mo Vaughn, Martinez will always have one swing no one can
ever take away.
</P>
<P>
   His seventh-inning grand slam off left-hander Mark Langston on
Saturday night gave the New York Yankees a 9-6 victory over the San
Diego Padres in Game 1 of the best-of-seven series.
</P>
<P>
   It also capped a comeback that made the Yankees look like, well,
the Yankees. They had trailed by three runs entering the seventh
inning and the crowd of 56,712 was getting a little nervous.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think everybody on the bench took a deep breath,'' said
Yankees manager Joe Torre, who coaxed Martinez out for a curtain
call. ``It's been a tough time for Tino. We all felt great for
him.''
</P>
<P>
   Martinez came in with just five hits in 32 at-bats in the
postseason. And his home run came one pitch after Langston thought
he had a strikeout. But home plate umpire Rich Garcia called
Langston's 2-2 fastball low, setting up the biggest moment of the
night.
</P>
<P>
   The home run landed in the lower stands in right field, scoring
Derek Jeter, Bernie Williams and Chili Davis and giving the Yankees
a 9-5 lead. Mariano Rivera came on to get the final out of the
eighth and retired the side in order in the ninth.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just came out here every day and expected to turn it
around,'' Martinez said. ``I never got down. These guys wouldn't
let me get down. That is why we have been so successful.''
</P>
<P>
   The seventh inning was redemption for more than just Martinez.
Chuck Knoblauch, whose mental lapse helped lose Game 2 of the
American League Championship Series, tied the game with a three-run
homer off Padres reliever Donne Wall.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tonight's a great feeling,'' Knoblauch said. ``We got to the
ALCS and we got to this point. It's a great night tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees had just gotten rid of San Diego ace Kevin Brown,
whom the Padres hope can pitch Games 4 and 7, if needed. He made
103 pitches in 61/3 innings and took a sharp grounder off the shin
early in the game.
</P>
<P>
   Brown was given a 5-2 lead after two home runs by Greg Vaughn
and a solo homer by Tony Gwynn, the eight-time batting champion who
is playing in his first World Series since 1984. All three came off
Yankees starter David Wells, who still wound up the winning
pitcher.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we've all got a little spoiled with David,'' Torre
said of Wells, who now has four victories in the postseason. ``He
had good velocity but he put them in some bad spots.''
</P>
<P>
   For six innings the game belonged to the Padres, underdogs in
all three of their postseason series.
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn, the left fielder who hit 50 home runs for San Diego
during the regular season, added two more to put the Padres ahead
5-2. This was the same Vaughn who was traded to New York last
season but sent back when his right shoulder failed a physical.
</P>
<P>
   The first home run came on a 2-2 fastball from Wells that first
appeared to be a casual fly ball to right center. But the ball
carried well past the 385-foot sign and into the stands.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd was stunned and quiet for the first time all night.
They were ready to start the celebration when rookie Ricky Ledee
gave the Yankees the early lead with a two-run double into the
right field corner.
</P>
<P>
   Ledee, placed on the postseason roster 2{ weeks ago when Darryl
Strawberry was diagnosed with colon cancer, not only got a hit in
his first World Series at-bat, he turned on the mighty Brown like
he had been doing it all his life.
</P>
<P>
   But Vaughn's first homer quickly tied it and Gwynn gave the
Padres a 4-2 lead in the fifth when he whacked Wells' first pitch
off the face of the upper deck with Quilvio Veras on first.
</P>
<P>
   Vaugh was next, and he hooked Wells' first pitch around the
left-field foul pole for his second homer.
</P>
<P>
   There was nothing cheap about either homer, but if you expected
it to match some long-ago series record, think again. Florida's
Moises Alou and Charles Johnson did it last year in the fourth
inning of Game 1.
</P>
<P>
   Although Brown was cruising, he was throwing a lot of pitches _
and that was his eventual undoing.
</P>
<P>
   Brown seemed fine when he struck out Martinez to end the sixth,
but he was gone after allowing a single and a walk to No.8-9
hitters Jorge Cosada and Ledee.
</P>
<P>
   Wall came in to face Knoblauch and fell behind 2-0. The next
pitch was a fastball and Knoblauch drove it into the left-field
stands to tie the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``It feels like you didn't do enough,'' Vaughn said. ``You know,
we battled. We battled. It's a tough one to swallow. We've been
here before. You just have to come out and go get them tomorrow.''

FOR SURE, THESE YANKS ARE SPECIAL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DOUG KRIKORIAN  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It seemed as though the opener of the 94th World
Series Saturday night was settled by the fifth inning when Tony
Gwynn and Greg Vaughn hit back-to-back home runs to stake Kevin
Brown and the San Diego Padres to a 5-2 lead against the New York
Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   Giving Mr. Brown such an advantage this October is roughly
tantamount to, say, giving the ball to Michael Jordan in June with
a game on the line.
</P>
<P>
   The outcome would seem to be almost automatic, considering Brown
has been Sandy Koufax, Bob Gibson and Roger Clemens all wrapped up
into one obscene-throwing 6-4, 205-pounder who tore through the
National League during the regular season and through Houston and
Atlanta during the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   No way the Yankees could overcome such an insurmountable edge,
not with David Wells so shaky, not with New York's RBI leader, Tino
Martinez, immersed in a terrible slump, not with Tony Gwynn putting
on a hitting demonstration, not with the streaking Padres bursting
with confidence.
</P>
<P>
   But these Yankees aren't the Houston Astros, or Atlanta Braves,
those hapless Padre playoff victims.
</P>
<P>
   These Yankees, performing for the 35th time in their ancestral
fall rite, are something special and showed Kevin Brown and the
Padres why they swept across the summer with an American League
record 114 victories.
</P>
<P>
   They knocked Brown out of the match in the seventh inning and
then two Yankee players who have been struggling with the bats,
Chuck Knoblauch and Martinez, knocked the Padres out of Yankee
Stadium with booming home runs that spurred a seven-run eruption
that resulted in a 9-6 victory before 56,712 delirious onlookers.
</P>
<P>
   Form once again took a beating in this one except for the final
result.
</P>
<P>
   Who would have thought the Yankees would be so disdainfully
impervious to Kevin Brown? Who would have thought David Wells would
be roughed up for five runs in the first five innings? Who would
have thought the first Yankee to score against Brown would be
driven in by the rookie leftfielder, Ricky Ledee? Who would have
thought Chuck Knoblauch, slumping throughout the regular season
with a .265 average and slumping throughout the playoffs with a
.167 average, would tie the game with a three-run homer?
</P>
<P>
   And, most of all, who would have thought the left-handed hitting
Tino Martinez, a mere 5 for 32 for a .156 average in this
post-season as he strode to the plate in that seventh inning
against the left-handed Mark Langston, would seal the Yankee
triumph with a grand slam home run?
</P>
<P>
   ``I needed that ... a big relief,'' admitted Martinez later.
``It's been a tough month for me, but you can't get too down in
this game. You have to battle it day to day. And that's what I've
been doing. I was just fortunate to get a pitch down the middle.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, when the count was two and two, Tino Martinez took a
pitch down that middle that appeared to be a strike to everyone in
the park except to Martinez and to the plate umpire, Rich Garcia.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was over the plate, but definitely low,'' insisted
Martinez.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looked to be a strike, but what can you say?'' said San
Diego manager Bruce Bochy.
</P>
<P>
   Bochy himself could be held responsible for creating some of the
havoc for the Padres, not so much by yanking Brown, who was
faltering, but by replacing him with Donne Wall.
</P>
<P>
   Wall had his bright moments during the regular season, but in
the playoffs he has been ineffective, yielding five hits and three
runs in his previous appearances.
</P>
<P>
   ``Definitely, we were glad to see Kevin Brown out of the game,''
said Tino Martinez.
</P>
<P>
   No one was happier to see Wall than Chuck Knoblauch, the stout
second baseman who greeted him with his home run that barely
cleared the leftfield fence behind the 318-foot sign.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those homers by Knoblauch and Martinez are the kind of
confidence-builders that can get them going,'' said Yankee manager
Joe Torre afterward.
</P>
<P>
   That might be an ominous development for the Padres, heavy
underdogs who squandered a three-hit, two-RBI performance from Tony
Gwynn and squandered a big lead with their best pitcher on the
mound.
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, before David Wells made his first pitch at 8:07
Eastern Standard Time on a 57-degree evening, there were already
all sorts of intriguing subplots and controversies surrounding this
series.
</P>
<P>
   Wells went on the Howard Stern Show Thursday and created tabloid
headlines, even though he didn't shed any apparel or say anything
outlandish, unless you consider it outlandish that he picked the
Yankees to beat the Padres in five games.
</P>
<P>
   What would have been outlandish, of course, if David Wells had
picked the Padres to whip his team in five games.
</P>
<P>
   Upset that Wells would make such a rash prediction that I guess
defied hallowed thou-shall-not-open-your-mouth-in-an-
</P>
<P>
   unseemly-manner World Series convention, the esteemed pitching
coach of the Padres, Mr. Dave Stewart, defiled Wells' reputation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've faced five pitchers in the playoffs who are better than
David Wells,'' claimed Stewart, referring to the Astros' Randy
Johnson and Shane Reynolds and the Braves' John Smoltz, Tom Glavine
and Greg Maddux.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, considering the way the Padres worked over Wells Torre
removed him after the seventh inning Stewart might be right.
</P>
<P>
   The Boss, George Steinbrenner, a model of low-key restraint
throughout this glorious Yankee season, reportedly also was miffed
that baseball commissioner Bud Selig decided to have Tony Bennett
perform the pre-game singing duties that are traditionally done at
Yankee Stadium by the former opera star, Robert Merrill.
</P>
<P>
   And in an act of pure sacrilege, the 72-year-old Bennett didn't
even sing the National Anthem, the first time in the second half of
the 20th century that this has happened at a World Series according
to venerable baseball historians who monitor such arcane matters.
</P>
<P>
   Lest you think ol' Tony is some anti-American Bolshevik, forget
it.
</P>
<P>
   He sang ``God Bless America'' with a flair that would have made
Kate Smith proud, eliciting loud applause from the crowd, including
even Steinbrenner.
</P>
<P>
   George will have Merrill, whom he considers a Yankee good luck
charm, back doing the Star Spangled Banner honors before Game 2
tonight.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe Robert Merrill, instead, will bring good fortune to the
Padres, who now desperately need it after the fates so cruelly
betrayed them on a night that seemed theirs until the Yankees
displayed their greatness.

USC WINS EASILY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PULLMAN, Wash. _ All those USC fans clamoring for more of
freshman quarterback Carson Palmer got their wish Saturday night,
although it took an upset stomach to get him in the lineup ahead of
Mike Van Raaphorst.
</P>
<P>
   Van Raaphorst was forced to leave against Washington State in
the second quarter after experiencing nausea, and the Trojans'
offense never looked back.
</P>
<P>
   Palmer's appearance seemed to infuse confidence into the
offense, because the Trojans went on a 28-point scoring blitz and
defeated the Cougars 42-14 before 31,178 at Martin Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``We learned a very painful lesson last week (in a loss to
Cal),'' USC coach Paul Hackett said. ``It's nice to see the way we
responded to that lesson. I thought we played all the way to the
end. That was the No.1 thing that we wanted to accomplish. We must
have the ability to win at the end.''
</P>
<P>
   The Trojans (5-2, 3-1) picked up a critical victory with their
bowl hopes beginning to hang in the balance. USC must now win two
of its final five games to be eligible for a bowl.
</P>
<P>
   More importantly, the offense finally showed signs of emerging
from its doldrums, with Palmer leading the way.
</P>
<P>
   If nothing else, the quarterback controversy should be reignited
for another week after Palmer completed 8 of 16 passes for 143
yards and one touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   ``No.15 came in and did the things he had to do,'' Hackett said.
</P>
<P>
   Enough to start next week against Oregon?
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to see where Mike is,'' Hackett said.
</P>
<P>
   The offense received a twin boost between Palmer's early
insertion and the return of tailback Chad Morton.
</P>
<P>
   Morton gave the Trojans some much-needed elusiveness in the
backfield that had been missing the previous two games, when he was
sidelined with a bruised back. Morton gained 68 yards in 16 carries
and scored a touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   But Palmer was the key.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't really know what to expect,'' Palmer said. ``(Mike)
came off and said he didn't feel well. He said he felt like he
would throw up. He just didn't look like he felt well at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Prior to the true freshman's appearance, the offense was showing
signs of its usual rut in the first half. It had produced just
seven points midway through the second quarter, with linebacker
Chris Claiborne responsible for another touchdown on an
interception.
</P>
<P>
   Coincidence or not, the offense woke up behind Palmer, just like
it had in several previous victories.
</P>
<P>
   On Palmer's second snap, Petros Papadakis raced 53 yards up the
middle to put USC ahead 21-14 in the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Palmer got more involved in the third quarter, throwing a 2-yard
touchdown pass from Palmer to tight end Lonnie Ford. Moments later,
wide receiver R. Jay Soward broke the game open on a 27-yard
touchdown run off a reverse.
</P>
<P>
   Soward's score gave the Trojans a 35-14 lead with 9:16 left in
the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Palmer then completed a 67-yard pass to tight end Antoine Harris
that culminated with Morton scoring on a 6-yard run to give the
Trojans a 42-14 lead in the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we just decided to pick it up at halftime,'' Palmer
said. ``We got a lot of momentum at halftime.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the defense remained consistent, intercepting six of
quarterback Paul Mencke's passes, with Claiborne snagging two.
</P>
<P>
   Prior to USC's 28-0 scoring run, it looked like the Trojans
would be in another struggle, even though the weather (46 degrees)
never posed a problem.
</P>
<P>
   As has so often been the case, Claiborne bailed out the Trojans.
He stole a pass intended for Love Jefferson and returned it 25
yards for a touchdown to give the Trojans a 14-7 advantage. It was
Claiborne's second interception return for a touchdown this season.
</P>
<P>
   The momentum from that touchdown evaporated, however, thanks to
the Trojans' penchant for silly penalties. USC lined up offsides on
the kickoff, and on the second try Washington State's Dee Moronkola
returned it 49 yards to the Trojans 45-yard line. Six plays later,
Mencke found Nian Taylor wide open on a 29-yard touchdown pass to
tie the game.
</P>
<P>
   Washington State (3-4, 0-4) wasted little time scoring to open
the game. The Cougars went 78 yards with tailback DeJuan Gilmore
going off tackle 35 yards for a touchdown and 7-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   USC struck back later in the quarter as the offense finally
concentrated on throwing to senior receivers Billy Miller and Mike
Bastianelli. Miller caught two passes on the drive, then Van
Raaphorst found Bastianelli over the middle for a 32-yard gain.
</P>
<P>
   Three plays later, Van Raaphorst hit Soward in the corner for a
13-yard touchdown pass to tie the game, 7-7.
</P>
<P>
   It was almost remarkable the way USC focused on Miller,
considering he had just 16 receptions in the first six games.
Miller caught seven passes in the first half.

   &UR; Burning the Days: Recollection &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By James Salter. Vintage International, $13.
</P>
<P>
   The novelist recalls his many careers -- fighter pilot,
expatriate in Paris, screenwriter -- as if they were a series of
love affairs bound by masculine energy and a fondness for women. In
1997 our reviewer, Samuel Hynes, said this memoir gives ``eloquent
witness to the ... power of the human imagination to re-create in
language the feeling of being, with all its elations and
despairs.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; The History of the Siege of Lisbon &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By Jos Saramago. Translated by Giovanni Pontiero.
Harvest/Harcourt Brace, $13.
</P>
<P>
   The hero of this ingenious novel is a humble proofreader who in
a flash of creative lunacy alters the national saga of Portugal by
inserting a single word into a standard history text. His
publishing house is outraged, but his boss is intrigued by his
subversiveness and urges him to follow up on his impulse to rewrite
the past. In recounting their highbrow courtship, the Portuguese
author, who was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature earlier this
month, ``has a sure sense of the pleasurable danger of seduction,
the fear of offending, the wild hope of wooing,'' Edmund White
wrote in these pages last year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; The Franchise: A History of Sports Illustrated Magazine &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By Michael MacCambridge. Hyperion, $14.95.
</P>
<P>
   This exhaustively researched book tracks the symbiotic rise of
big-time sports and one of the world's most successful magazines,
focusing on the combustible mix of raging egos, talent, crushing
pressures and Time Inc. cash that redefined sportswriting. Last
year our reviewer, Bruce McCall, called the author ``scrupulously
objective and fair-minded.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; The World is the Home of Love and Death: Stories &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By Harold Brodkey. Metropolitan/Holt, $15.
</P>
<P>
   This posthumously published collection revisits the author's
childhood and his obsession with the many haunted voices of the
past. The characters -- like the tales -- are constantly changing,
by turns angry and gentle, crazy and sane. ``Brodkey's style is a
magnificent achievement,'' Jonathan Rosen wrote here in 1997. ``He
captured the child's world spinning inside the adult mind.'' Holt
has reissued  &UR; First Love and Other Sorrows: Stories &LR; , ($14), which
follows the lives of educated, middle-class people in the 1950s and
includes three new stories. In 1958 in The New York Times, William
Goyen said, ``Brodkey shows ... an uncommon perception of the
secret glow within the trivialities of our poor human majesty.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Summer for the Gods: The Scopes Trial and America's Continuing
Debate Over Science and Religion &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By Edward J. Larson. Harvard University, $14.95.
</P>
<P>
   Long before O.J., there was another trial of the century, the
Scopes ``monkey trial'' of 1925, which had everything a media
circus could ask for: faith versus reason, biology versus the Bible
and colorful lawyers jousting over the role of religion in public
life. This Pulitzer Prize-winning account is ``an excellent
cultural history of the case,'' Rodney A. Smolla said here last
year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Lightning Song &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By Lewis Nordan. Algonquin, $10.95.
</P>
<P>
   Leroy Dearman is a goofy 12-year-old living on a Mississippi
llama farm who is driven to distraction by the women around him,
notably his mother and a seductive teen-age baton twirler. ``I love
this boy,'' Valerie Sayers wrote here in 1997. ``I also love the
excesses of this novel's language.''  &UR; The Starlite Drive-In &LR; , by
Marjorie Reynolds (Berkley, $6.99), also features an anxious
12-year-old hero: a tomboy who tells what happens when a brooding
stranger turns up to help her father run a drive-in theater in
Indiana. ``Reynolds tidily explores the gap between fantasy and
reality in her surely told first novel,'' Megan Harlan wrote in
these pages last year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Space Is the Place: The Lives and Times of Sun Ra &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By John F. Szwed. Da Capo, $16.95.
</P>
<P>
   Herman Poole Blount, a k a Sun Ra, was the wildly eccentric
leader of an influential jazz ensemble that baffled and enchanted
listeners for more than 40 years until his death in 1993. ``Szwed
has produced a rare jazz biography -- one that takes full account
of the history that shaped the music and its central
personalities,'' Brent Staples wrote here in 1997. The same
publisher has issued  &UR; Milestones: The Music and Times of Miles
Davis &LR; , by Jack Chambers ($21.95), which combines both volumes of
the author's earlier biography of the trumpeter and includes a new
introduction detailing Davis's final years. Reviewing the second
volume here in 1985, Francis Davis said, ``Chambers deserves praise
for his assiduous research as well as for his insightful
criticism.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Black Jacks: African American Seamen in the Age of Sail &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By W. Jeffrey Bolster. Harvard University, $14.95.
</P>
<P>
   A historian pulls together two centuries of rousing nautical
lore, showing how seafaring commerce not only offered
African-Americans a sense of the wider world but allowed them to
bring back word of blacks in other countries. ``The book crackles
with enough drama for many novels or plays,'' Carla Davidson said
here in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; All Around Atlantis: Stories &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By Deborah Eisenberg. Washington Square/Pocket Books, $14.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the protagonists in this collection are affluent,
neglected children whose precocious perceptions are offset by an
inability to articulate them. Last year our reviewer, Jim Shepard,
found the stories to be ``spirited and masterly road maps through
sad and forbidding and desolate terrain.''

   MICROSOFT-HISTORY (Washington) _ A little-noticed press
conference featuring Bill Gates and a mid-level IBM executive at a
computer show in 1989 first brought Microsoft to the attention of
federal antitrust enforcers. And in the decade since then, the
company has been the subject of unrelenting investigations, one

   MICROSOFT-ANTITRUST (Undated) _ The antitrust laws at the core
of the Department of Justice's suit against the Microsoft Corp.
have been around for over a hundred years. Yet their broad

what many antitrust experts regard as an intellectual muddle _
confusing interpretations that leave the basic purpose and concepts
of the antitrust laws largely unresolved. That confusion nearly
guarantees that any jury verdict in this case will be appealed.

`HENRY CLAY FRICK: AN INTIMATE PORTRAIT' _ ART AND GRIEF THEORY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.Y., Md.)  (mk) 
 By JUDITH H. DOBRZYNSKI    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the month before Henry Clay Frick died in 1919, he would
descend at night from his second-floor, wood-paneled bedroom to the
ground floor of his Fifth Avenue mansion, which is today the Frick
Collection. He would sit in the dark, ashes accumulating on his
cigar, and stare at one of his many paintings, which would be lit
by only a small spotlight. After a time, he would move to another
masterpiece.
</P>
<P>
   Was this much-hated coke-and-steel baron thinking about the
money he spent amassing his renowned collection or the respect it
brought him? About his industrial legacy or his reputation as a
rabid anti-unionist? Or, perhaps, about the artists' intentions?
</P>
<P>
   None of the above, says his great-granddaughter Martha Frick
Symington Sanger. Frick, she contends in a book published last
week, was contemplating moments in his life that he had marked by
buying particular paintings, many relating to his beloved daughter
Martha, who died at age 6 after four years of a debilitating
infection. ``He was reliving his life,'' Ms. Sanger said, a life
haunted by longing for Martha, whose likeness he even reproduced on
his checks.
</P>
<P>
   Frick's collecting, in other words, was driven by his
psychology, shaped more by his grief than by his vaunted
connoisseurship or need for status symbols.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Sanger's thesis stands in stark contrast to the traditional
view, as stated in ``Art in the Frick Collection'' (Frick/Abrams,
1996), which emphasizes her great-grandfather's discriminating eye
and credits him as the prototype for many great American
collectors.
</P>
<P>
   ``This book breaks the rules,'' Ms. Sanger said, ``and an art
historian probably couldn't write a book like this. But it makes
sense to me. I'm a family member, and I didn't have academic hoops
to jump through.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Sanger, 54, does not dispute her great-grandfather's
``natural eye for beauty,'' but she says that his artworks had more
important meanings, literally, emotionally and symbolically. In
buying them, she said one recent day as she walked around the Frick
explaining the significance of various paintings, ``he displaced
his feelings for Martha.''
</P>
<P>
   Her thesis, she said, springs from modern grief theory. ``When
mourning is unresolved, people acquire or keep `linking objects,'
something the deceased loved or had at death,'' she explained.
``One must be open and willing to do so, but you can see that the
paintings became linking objects. That's why he spent hours alone
at night with only the paintings showing.''
</P>
<P>
   To reach that conclusion, Ms. Sanger spent the last 10 years
researching her family history, poring over archives and books,
traveling to the places that figured in Frick's life and
interviewing hundreds of people. The result is ``Henry Clay Frick:
An Intimate Portrait'' (Abbeville Press), a 600-page tome that
weighs 7 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike previous biographies of Frick, Ms. Sanger's book goes
beyond his business career and delves into his personal life. The
defining moment, she argues, occurred four years after Martha's
1891 death and three years after Frick survived an assassination
attempt that evoked, he later claimed, an apparition of Martha.
</P>
<P>
   In 1895, in a delayed reaction to those events, Frick had a
nervous breakdown. Though he had bought a few paintings each year
beginning in 1881, he suddenly began to collect at a feverish pace.
That July, on the 10th anniversary of Martha's birth, he bought
Bouguereau's ``Mischievous Girl,'' a portrait resembling Martha.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was the moment his collection pattern was established,''
Ms. Sanger said. Rembrandt's ``Polish Rider,'' for example, recalls
Frick's journeys on his gray horse, Billy, through Pennsylvania's
coal bluffs early in his career, she said, while El Greco's
``Purification of the Temple,'' in which Jesus drives out the
money-changers, commemorates Frick's violent victory over the
unions at the Homestead steel mill.
</P>
<P>
   His second daughter, Helen Clay Frick, on whom he grew
increasingly dependent as his wife, Adelaide, suffered from severe
depression, continued her father's pattern until her death in 1985,
Ms. Sanger said. Helen was responsible, for example, for buying
Bastiani's ``Adoration of Magi,'' the only purchase made during
1935, the 50th anniversary of Martha's birth. ``Martha was the
adored child,'' Ms. Sanger said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Sanger seems an unlikely source of such a groundbreaking
thesis. She freely declares that she dropped out of junior college
and lacks an author's credentials. ``I never wrote a book,'' she
said, ``I never read a book.'' Instead, she married, raised three
daughters, raced championship horses and served as steward for the
National Steeplechase and Hunt Association.
</P>
<P>
   Now divorced and living in Stevenson, Md., she started
researching her family history as therapy, as a need to understand
the alcoholism among family members, including her mother, for more
than 100 years.
</P>
<P>
   And she had her own demon to exorcise. It is no accident, she
was told, that she is the namesake of Frick's tragic daughter,
which was also her mother's name. As the third daughter of parents
who wanted a boy, she said, ``I was the cursed child and the spare
child.''
</P>
<P>
   Growing up, Ms. Sanger said she was given a ``sainted view'' of
Frick. So she set out to explore him ``as a person.'' Her thesis
began to dawn on her when she visited his birthplace in West
Overton, Pa. ``I happened to stand at the window,'' she recounted,
``and I thought `that looks like the Rousseau in the Frick,''' a
reference to ``The Village of Becquigny.''
</P>
<P>
   A little later, she journeyed to Salem, Ore., where she
interviewed the son of one of Frick's tutors. He had a photograph
of Frick holding Martha's dog that was not in the family archives.
``It jumped out at me,'' Ms. Sanger recalled, because it mimicked a
painting by George Romney of Lady Hamilton holding a dog, which
Frick bought in 1904.
</P>
<P>
   ``I discovered the fact that Lady Hamilton was the same age in
the painting as Martha would have been'' in 1904, Ms. Sanger said.
``This painting was at the foot of his bed when he died.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The other painting in his bedroom was also telling, she said.
Sir Thomas Lawrence's ``Miss Louisa Murray'' also looks like
Martha, but is somewhat unnatural. ``It's disturbing,
apparition-like,'' Ms. Sanger maintains, and it demonstrates to her
that Frick's ``feelings vibrate from idealism to nightmare, from
the beautiful child to the demonic Martha that haunts him.'' The
painting has never been on view, Ms. Sanger said, ``but it's one of
the most important paintings in the collection as far as the family
is concerned.''
</P>
<P>
   The family, according to Ms. Sanger's older sister Helen Clay
Chace, largely subscribes to the book's analysis.
</P>
<P>
   After seeing the Romney portrait and ``Becquigny,'' Ms. Sanger's
work gathered speed. ``It was like cracking a code,'' she said,
``and once I got it, painting after painting began to reveal
itself.''
</P>
<P>
   Frick, who was trained as an accountant, wrote virtually nothing
about his paintings, but he did enter the date of his purchases in
an account book.
</P>
<P>
   ``I found the language,'' she said, ``the paintings that turn up
on anniversaries and so on.''
</P>
<P>
   For example, he bought Millet's ``Woman Sewing by Lamplight,'' a
portrait Ms. Sanger believes recalls Frick's early life, shortly
after his mother died. (He placed it opposite ``Becquigny.'') He
acquired John Hopner's ``Ladies Sarah and Catherine Bligh,'' which
resembles his wife and her sister, Attie, just after Attie died.
</P>
<P>
   Four months before his death in 1919, and just after the July
anniversary of Martha's death, Frick bought Vermeer's ``Mistress
and Maid.'' It depicts a woman interrupted by the delivery of an
obviously disturbing letter from her servant, and Ms. Sanger says
it refers to the frantic correspondence between Frick and his wife
as Martha lay dying. The jeweled casket in the painting is like
Martha's jeweled casket.
</P>
<P>
   ``One or two paintings would be a shaky case,'' Ms. Sanger
asserted, ``but the entire collection speaks to his psychology.''
Ms. Sanger said that art in Frick's former home in Pittsburgh,
Clayton, also supports her thesis. ``It's a shrine to Martha.''
</P>
<P>
   Paradoxically, it is the sweeping case Ms. Sanger constructs
that prompts some skepticism. At a book party for her this month,
one art expert who insisted on anonymity said he could believe the
grief connection for some paintings, but not for most of it, as Ms.
Sanger posits.
</P>
<P>
   And among the early reviews, Publisher's Weekly also suggested
that the book did not tell the whole story behind Frick's
collecting, although other trade magazines praise the book as well
written and well documented.
</P>
<P>
   Answering the skeptics, Ms. Sanger said she was the first person
to have access to the diaries, account books, photo albums, letters
and other elements in family archives. And her thesis, she said,
``makes sense to people who've lost a child, who are familiar with
art therapy or who carry a troubled family history. Those people
who don't understand how people can relate to art will have trouble
with it.''
</P>
<P>
   In any case, the book has lifted a weight for her. ``Writing is
very cathartic,'' she said, adding that she has now turned her
attention to her mother, who died a few years ago. ``My next book
will be about the daughter's search for the mother.''

MICROSOFT TRIAL DEFINED BY NARROW DISPUTE, HUGE STAKES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Colo., Ohio)  (See also MICROSOFT-GAMEPLANS, MICROSOFT-HISTORY,

 By MICHAEL M. WEINSTEIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The case of United States vs. Microsoft Corp., the government's
most aggressive move against a monopolist in almost 25 years, is
playing out against a century of antitrust laws so broadly worded
and court rulings so ambiguous that both sides are citing the same
rulings to support their opposing arguments.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the outcome of the trial, scheduled to begin Monday in
U.S. District Court in Washington, an almost certain appeal will
leave to the Supreme Court the task of bringing legal order to 100
years of clashing antitrust doctrines.
</P>
<P>
   The case focuses on Microsoft's Windows, the operating system
that controls about 90 percent of all personal computers sold
today. The government says its objective is to curb illegal
monopolistic business practices that threaten to render large parts
of the economy vulnerable to the vicissitudes of a single company.
Microsoft asserts that the case is intended to give the government
control over which features can be added to Windows.
</P>
<P>
   However grand the economic stakes, the legal dispute is narrow.
The government says that Microsoft's contracts with computer
manufacturers and with companies that provide access to the
Internet illegally stifle competition.
</P>
<P>
   The contracts prohibit manufacturers from substituting Netscape
Communications Corp.'s Navigator browser for Microsoft's Internet
Explorer. They also prohibit them from removing from the Windows
main screen, or desktop, links to sites on the World Wide Web run
by Microsoft or its partners.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's contracts with companies that connect people to the
Internet and with businesses that sell goods and services on the
Web require favored treatment for Internet Explorer over Navigator
in exchange for links on the Windows desktop. In the wake of the
lawsuit, Microsoft has voluntarily dropped some of these
requirements, though it could reinstate them at will.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft says that its contracts are legal because they produce
tangible benefits for customers, including easier Internet access.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department says that the bundling of Explorer with
Windows 95 and the inclusion of the browser as part of Windows 98
amount to ``tying,'' an illegal practice that forces customers of
one product to purchase another. The contracts with manufacturers
and Internet services are illegal, the government says, because
they are intended not only to create a monopoly in the browser
market but to protect Microsoft's existing monopoly in operating
systems.
</P>
<P>
   The latter threat is key, according to the Justice Department.
Browsers have the potential, like an operating system, to act as a
software platform on which other programs run. So contracts
intended to drive browsers out of the market would also insulate
the Windows monopoly.
</P>
<P>
   Many antitrust experts say the problem facing the Justice
Department is that the courts have provided no clear definition of
tying and no clear guidelines for determining when contracts are
illegally exclusionary.
</P>
<P>
   Professor Lawrence White of New York University, who was chief
economist of the Justice Department's antitrust division in the
early 1980s, says that the courts treat tying as an unusual
practice when in fact it is ubiquitous. No one, he said, ``would
challenge the right of manufacturers to tie erasers to the tip of
pencils, tires to an automobile or buttons to shirts.''
</P>
<P>
   His point, shared widely among economists, is that some tying
benefits consumers if, for example, it results in products that are
easier to use or enables a company to recover development costs.
</P>
<P>
   But tying can be bad if it locks in monopoly power. The courts,
White says, have not offered enough guidance for distinguishing
good tying from bad, which is the nub of the legal dispute.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft says it needs only to show that bundling Windows and
Explorer passes what might be called a ``gross'' consumer benefits
test _ that it offers an immediate benefit, whether or not it
causes long-term damage to competition and, therefore, ultimately
to consumers.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department says that Microsoft's practices must
clear a higher hurdle: yielding ``net'' consumer benefits that are
immediate and large enough to balance possible long-term harm to
competition.
</P>
<P>
   So which test of consumer benefits satisfies antitrust laws? The
simple answer is that no one knows for sure, which is why both
sides can reasonably cite the same cases without fear of
embarrassment.
</P>
<P>
   Consider a 1985 case, Aspen Skiing Co. vs. Aspen Highlands
Skiing Corp., and a 1951 case, Lorain Journal Co. vs. United
States.
</P>
<P>
   In the first, Aspen Skiing, the owner of three major ski runs in
Aspen, Colo. _ the monopolist _ had for years sold a ticket in
cooperation with Aspen Highlands, a competitor, that gave skiers
access to both companies' runs. When Aspen Skiing unilaterally
canceled the agreement, its rival's revenues shriveled and the
rival sued. The Supreme Court ruled that Aspen Skiing had violated
antitrust laws because there was no evidence its action helped
consumers.
</P>
<P>
   In the Lorain Journal case, the only local newspaper in Lorain,
Ohio, refused to sell advertising to companies that advertised on a
new radio station. Here, too, the Supreme Court ruled that the
exclusionary practice did nothing to benefit consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, in Aspen Skiing, the court even forced the monopolist to
do business with its rival, a precedent that augurs well for the
Justice Department, which seeks to force Microsoft to install
Netscape's browser alongside its own.
</P>
<P>
   But Charles Rule, a legal consultant to Microsoft, says that in
both cases the courts threw out exclusionary practices only because
they offered no consumer benefit. The courts, he argues, never
pounced on practices that resulted in lower prices or better
products or service.
</P>
<P>
   Nor did the courts in either case call for balancing immediate
benefits against hypothetical long-term harm. Rule argues that
Microsoft's practices produce demonstrable consumer benefits.
Besides, he says, unlike the actions taken by The Lorain Journal or
Aspen Skiing, Microsoft's contracts do not prevent consumers from
installing Netscape's browser or from using the Web sites of
Microsoft's rivals.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   In truth, though, neither case answered what consumer benefit
test should apply to product design.
</P>
<P>
   In Jefferson Parish Hospital District No. 2 et al. vs. Hyde,
another case cited by both sides, the Supreme Court in 1984
recognized that surgeons and anesthesiologists provide an
integrated service. Yet, the court said, a hospital with monopoly
power would still not be allowed to force surgical patients to use
its panel of anesthesiologists if consumers wanted to purchase the
two services separately. That principle could undercut Microsoft's
defense that the functional interdependence of Windows and Explorer
requires bundling.
</P>
<P>
   But Microsoft will point to a strong concurring opinion that
called for a tougher standard for the government to meet when it
alleges tying. Microsoft will also draw support from several court
rulings that allowed IBM to change the design of its computers in
ways that made it hard for vendors to attach peripheral equipment.
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps Microsoft's best argument is that nowhere has the
government identified a single case in which the courts explicitly
called for throwing out a tied product on the basis of a balancing
test. The courts, Microsoft will emphasize, steer clear of
redesigning technically sophisticated products.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department's rejoinder is to note that the sole
purpose of antitrust law is to protect consumers, so it makes no
sense to bless practices that provide a dollar's worth of benefits
today but, by stamping out competition, drive prices up by $1,000
tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department will ask the court to at least insist
that monopolists use the least exclusionary means possible to
achieve whatever services they provide customers.
</P>
<P>
   Experts agree that the courts will subject Microsoft's
restrictive contracts with Internet companies to a balancing test.
But exactly how the court will decide whether consumers are helped
or hurt is up for grabs. A balancing test would have the courts
weigh the immediate benefits to consumers of one-click access to
Internet sites and of features of a bundled Windows-Explorer
package versus the harm over time of diminished competition in the
markets for browsers and operating systems.
</P>
<P>
   But a test that makes good sense in theory can prove fiendishly
difficult to use in practice. ``Balancing tests are impossibly
difficult and arbitrary,'' said Rep. Thomas Campbell, R-Calif., who
is a former law professor at Stanford University. ``The practical
effect of balancing is to hand defendants like Microsoft almost
certain victory.''
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft argues _ and many antitrust experts agree _ that the
courts have in fact gravitated away from a balancing test toward a
simpler ``predation'' test for exclusionary contracts. Under this
standard, a contract is illegal only if it is intended to drive out
competition and thus to pave the way for a monopolist to raise
prices later. Microsoft will have an easier time defending itself
against a charge of predation, which amounts to victimizing its
customers, than it would defending itself against a charge that its
bundled product does consumers slightly more harm than good.
</P>
<P>
   The antitrust record, says William Baxter, who headed the
antitrust division under President Reagan, is littered with
``contradictory, ambiguous and sometimes nonsensical'' verdicts.
</P>
<P>
   He and other legal experts agree that if nothing else, that
record leaves plenty of legal leeway for the Supreme Court, should
it hear the Microsoft case, to stiffen the spine of the antitrust
law.

UPSTART AGENCY BECOMES A HOLLYWOOD PLAYER 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By BERNARD WEINRAUB   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOLLYWOOD _ Marty Adelstein, a partner at the Endeavor talent
agency in Beverly Hills, vividly recalled his first day at the
upstart company three years ago when he walked into his cramped
office situated then above a hamburger restaurant. He picked up the
phone to dial one of his top clients, David Kelley, the
writer-producer of hit shows like ``Ally McBeal'' and ``The
Practice.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The lights went out in the whole building and the phones went
dead,'' said Adelstein, 39, who had left the powerful Creative
Artists Agency to serve as an owner in the fledgling Endeavor
Agency. ``I was terrified. I thought, `What have I done?'''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, he's done quite well.
</P>
<P>
   Endeavor, which began in March 1995 when four top agents quit
their jobs at International Creative Management, opened makeshift
offices and did not take salaries for a year, has emerged as what
the trade paper Daily Variety called a significant player in the
cutthroat and potentially vastly lucrative world of talent
agencies. Its 10 partners are now believed to earn seven-figure
incomes.
</P>
<P>
   Now situated in sleek offices on Wilshire Boulevard, Endeavor
has endured some setbacks and is still struggling to forge a
significant movie division, but the agency has, in a relatively
short time, turned into a formidable and high-profile one. And it
has done so by breaking a number of rules, including, until
recently, maintaining an unusual 10-man partnership that runs the
agency instead of one or two people.
</P>
<P>
   Its growth is underscored by the fact that Endeavor is
relatively small in contrast to the other players, like the
Creative Artists Agency and International Creative Management. It
now has a staff of 70, including 30 agents, representing more than
300 clients ranging from Kelley and Larry David, a creator of
``Seinfeld,'' to actors like Adam Sandler, Edward Norton, Lisa
Kudrow, Bill Paxton and Bette Midler, to directors like Jon
Turteltaub (``Phenomenon''), Brad Silberling (``City of Angels''),
Philip Noyce (``Clear and Present Danger''), Bruce Beresford
(``Driving Miss Daisy'') and Kevin Smith (``Clerks''). The agency
also represents the television work of James Cameron, director of
``Titanic.''
</P>
<P>
   Endeavor's success rests heavily on its clients in TV, where
syndication fees and extravagant contracts for a handful of
writer-producers can make agencies wealthy. Endeavor not only
represents Kelley, one of the highest-priced writer-producers in
television, but Bonnie and Terry Turner (``Third Rock From the
Sun''), Glen Morgan and Jim Wong (``The X-Files'') and the
co-creator and executive producer of ``King of the Hill,'' Greg
Daniels.
</P>
<P>
   For the current television season, Endeavor represents J.J.
Abrams and Matt Reeves, who created the WB show ``Felicity,'' and
the screenwriter Aaron Sorkin, the writer-producer of ``Sports
Night.''
</P>
<P>
   One lawyer estimated that ``King of the Hill'' was a
``guaranteed home run'' for Endeavor, probably earning the agency
tens of millions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   On the film side, Endeavor has compiled a strong list of writers
and a handful of directors, and stepped only recently into the
business of representing actors. Last month, Brian Swardstrom, a
36-year-old agent-turned-manager, joined Endeavor as a partner and
brought along clients like Norton, Paxton and Parker Posey.
Swardstrom's Manhattan office near Soho will now serve as
Endeavor's New York beachhead.
</P>
<P>
   Paxton, who starred in the film ``Twister,'' had been
represented by the three biggest talent agencies in the last few
years _ Creative Artists, International Creative Management and the
William Morris Agency. His comment was typical of a successful
actor who is not in the Tom Cruise-Tom Hanks money league. ``These
big agencies have so many people they're trying to cover, and I
felt I was just getting lost in the shuffle,'' Paxton said. ``Part
of the problem is these big earners naturally get more attention.''
</P>
<P>
   But other new clients were plainly concerned. Turteltaub said he
went to Endeavor because of his friendship with his agent, David
Lonner. ``Certainly when you go to a smaller agency you lose the
bully factor _ the ability of a large agency to play the bully on
your behalf with either a studio or a network,'' he said. ``You
lose access to other clients of that specific agency. It is a
concern. But what you gain is sticking with a person whom you
believe in and trust.''
</P>
<P>
   Rival agents said that Endeavor's expansion into films could be
short-circuited by its relative small size. Without many A-list
film directors, who are at the bigger agencies, Endeavor may find
it difficult to lure an array of top or even mid-range stars. This
could turn Endeavor into a top-heavy TV agency without influence in
its movie division.
</P>
<P>
   The agency seems to have been started in the same manner that
Michael Ovitz, Ron Meyer _ now the president of Universal Studios _
and a handful of other young William Morris agents began Creative
Artists in 1975. Creative Artists started mostly as a television
agency, then turned into a powerhouse.
</P>
<P>
   Endeavor was born less than auspiciously. Four agents _ Ariel
Emanuel, Tom Strickler, David Greenblatt and Rick Rosen _ quit
their jobs at International Creative Management shortly after
midnight on March 29, 1995, hauling out files to cars. Legal action
was threatened against them, but nothing resulted. The partners
were joined six months later by Adelstein, a top television agent.
A year later three other agents _ Lonner, Adam Venit and Doug
Robinson _ defected from Creative Artists.
</P>
<P>
   Emanuel said the agency opened with a $500,000 bank credit line,
in which the partners' homes were held as collateral. Strickler,
who represents some top film writers, said, ``There was one crazy
moment for me when I thought, `If worse comes to worse, I'll lose
my house but I've got to be able to feed my dogs.' So I bought six
months worth of dog food and stored it in the bedroom.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Surprisingly, most of the writers and directors stayed with
agents who moved to Endeavor. But actors _ many of them anxious
about the small size of the agency _ were fickle. Wesley Snipes
left his agent at Endeavor to join William Morris. Anne Heche went
to Creative Artists. Will Smith opted to remain at Creative Artists
instead of joining his agent at Endeavor. Leonardo DiCaprio did not
want to choose between Venit and Creative Artists; he has no agent
and is represented by a manager. Another blow for Endeavor was when
the comedian Chris Farley died two weeks after he signed with the
agency.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Rabineau, a 40-year-old Endeavor agent, said the agency
was made up of friends. Such comments result in much eye-rolling
among rival agents who say that friendship in Hollywood only goes
so far. Personal collisions are bound to take place at Endeavor,
where some clients of television agents like Emanuel and Adelstein
earn far more money than clients of film agents, said several rival
agents.
</P>
<P>
   But Emanuel, whose brother is Rahm Emanuel, the White House
presidential adviser, said: ``People in this town dig up and create
conflicts. We all came from big agencies where people fought and
competed over everything _ money, clients, everything. We set up
this agency to escape that. We won't treat each other like the way
we were treated.''
</P>
<P>
   But partly to meet the criticisms that 10 men cannot totally
control a talent agency _ there are no female partners _ Endeavor
recently created a three-man management team to oversee the
company. The three are Emanuel, Adelstein and Rabineau. ``Hard to
believe, but you know what?'' Emanuel said. ``We respect each
other.''

IN BOOK PUBLISHING, THE WHALES ARE EATING THE WHALES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Germany, Great Britain)  (mk) 
 By DOREEN CARVAJAL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Borders are as flimsy as bookmarks in the global realm where
Thomas Middelhoff is preparing to take power as the new chief
executive of the Bertelsmann media and publishing conglomerate.
</P>
<P>
   On a September morning, Middelhoff, 44, rises to field questions
in German at a news briefing in Guetersloh, Germany. The following
afternoon, he is in a dark, wood-paneled room of the 21 Club in
Manhattan to go through the same business ritual in English.
</P>
<P>
   His son's electronic messages trail him from Germany, which he
answers in both languages. Five years from now, Middelhoff
declares, upper-level employees at Bertelsmann headquarters in
Guetersloh will speak English as the official corporate language.
And for those who blunder by referring to Bertelsmann as a German
conglomerate, Middelhoff, a self-described global citizen,
vigorously and frequently offers corrections.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not a German company,'' he insisted, adding, ``We are a
real global company.''
</P>
<P>
   That sentiment is spreading in the world's $80 billion-a-year
book market, which is not only becoming more concentrated among
mega-publishers, but also is increasingly becoming a borderless
territory with the expansion of electronic bookselling and global
deals. Such deals cross nations and languages and range from
Bertelsmann's purchase of Random House and its recent partnership
in Barnes &AMP; Noble's electronic bookstore to moves by the largest
French publisher, Hachette Livre, to acquire a majority stake in a
British consumer book company, Orion Publishing Group.
</P>
<P>
   With these global shifts has come a new generation of issues for
the publishing industry _ from the protection of
intellectual-property rights and the balance of power between
individual authors and behemoth publishers to concerns about
whether consolidation will crowd out smaller houses and lead to
homogenous literature.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whales are eating the whales,'' said Martin Levin, a
former publishing executive and lawyer who specializes in mergers
and acquisitions of publishing companies. ``It used to be that the
whales were eating the minnows. Now the appetites are so much
bigger. This is a watershed moment in publishing, where we have
never seen this kind of concentration before with global ownership
and the big getting bigger.''
</P>
<P>
   The zest for global reach has also taken hold at chain
booksellers like the Borders Group, which is preparing for eventual
superstore saturation in the United States by opening branches in
Singapore, Britain and Australia. The electronic bookseller,
Amazon.com, this month is opening two European Web site versions of
its operation with distribution points in Slough, England, and
Regensburg, Germany.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do think that the world is becoming a smaller place every
year that goes by,'' said Jeffrey Bezos, Amazon's founder and chief
executive, who said that the growing expansion of electronic book
sales could lead to more diversity and choice in literature.
</P>
<P>
   But he also said that the increasing consolidation of publishers
bears watching. ``If you get too much concentration on the
publishing side,'' he said, ``then you could start to get problems
with ideas and the ability of authors to get multiple outlets for
their work. If you took it to an extreme, it could be bad for the
industry. It could be bad for society.''
</P>
<P>
   To a certain extent, this global fever has spread to midsized
and small American publishers, which in a variety of ways are
casting about for partners, acquisitions or alliances to publish
directly into foreign markets, a trend propelled by the slow growth
of book sales.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's tough enough to make money in the U.S. market,'' said
Steven Schragis, publisher of Carol Publishing Group, which last
year foundered in an attempt to merge with Batsford Publishing in
London. ``There's always been the avenue of selling your rights to
foreign publishers, but you can make more money by exploiting your
own copyrights directly _ i.e., release it directly yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Prima Publishing, an independent company in Rocklin,
Calif., absorbed the employees of an inactive German publisher to
establish Prima Deutschland, which will try to tap the German
market for games with a division publishing game-strategy books.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's incredibly myopic for any company in the world that is
truly becoming a global village not to use its core strength to
expand overseas,'' said Ben Dominitz, Prima's founder and chief
executive. ``We tend to look at technology companies for models and
not publishing companies.''
</P>
<P>
   The bigger shifts in global ownership and book selling are so
new that no one is quite sure what impact, if any, such changes
could have on literature and culture.
</P>
<P>
   But the trends are pronounced enough that the chairman of the
Frankfurt Book Fair, Roland Ulmer, sought to draw attention to the
changes earlier this month in an opening speech at the huge annual
bazaar of books and publishers from all over the world.
</P>
<P>
   Ulmer noted that by as early as next year, more than 90 percent
of the American book market will be controlled by the 20 largest
competitors. On the technical, medical and scientific side of
publishing, the concentration is even greater, he said, with three
foreign companies dominating 90 percent of the U.S. market.
</P>
<P>
   Within the sprawling halls of the Frankfurt Book Fair, the joke
was that there was more gossip this year about buying companies
than of buying books. At panel discussions, futurists with
technology backgrounds floated the heretical view that copyright
protection was a medieval concept, arguing that it had no place in
a digital world, where information could be transferred with a few
computer-keyboard clicks.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   The rights directors of publishing houses held their own forums
to debate how globalization and electronic commerce had shifted the
international flow of books and the frontiers of language markets.
</P>
<P>
   The rights to a book generally are not global; for example,
selling a book that was published in the United States in a foreign
country may violate a British publisher's rights to sell that same
book in Britain. But those territorial boundaries are hard to
enforce at an electronic bookstore, which may not always know which
book is the British version or the American version.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting at his own cramped booth at the Frankfurt fair, Andre
Schiffrin, director of the not-for-profit New Press in New York,
said he was certain his public-interest publishing house would feel
the effects of globalization.
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, it is to his advantage because he expects some
authors to start coming to him for an alternative from the
corporate publishing houses. But he said the new bonds between
Bertelsmann and Barnes &AMP; Noble provided further impetus to seek new
sales and marketing outlets, like public forums to promote his
authors and their ideas.
</P>
<P>
   Such global shifts in ownership and book selling are also viewed
warily by authors.
</P>
<P>
   For Stephen King, whose best-selling books are also successful
in other countries, globalizaton is the ``literary equivalent of
grazing the rain forest to make hamburgers.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It lowers the IQ any time there is consolidation and there is
more of a focus on bestsellers,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The National Writers Union, a New York-based group with a
membership of more than 4,000 freelance writers and authors, has
decided that it needs to become global by forming alliances with
other international unions so it can follow the activities of large
multinational publishers, according to Jonathan Tasini, the union's
president.
</P>
<P>
   ``What writers are now starting to see is what we've seen in
other industries,'' he said. ``Their industries are being run by
companies with no national flag and when that happens you feel a
loss of control,'' said Tasini, who added that he expected that as
the companies grew, they would look for ways to economize, such as
through tougher negotiations with authors.
</P>
<P>
   At least three of the top American publishing houses _ two of
them newly merged companies _ are now reviewing their standard
forms of contracts with authors. Contracts are the critical
agreements that define the relationships between authors and
publishers, establishing what a writer will be paid and who has the
rights to sell a title in foreign countries.
</P>
<P>
   At Bertelsmann's Random House, contracts are under review, a
routine step in the wake of the merger with Bantam Doubleday Dell,
to edit out anachronistic language, a company spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   Middelhoff of Bertelsmann, who will be formally promoted to
chief executive in November, said that despite the criticism and
concern of some authors, globalization of ownership and bookselling
might in some ways increase the diversity of voices in literature.
Through electronic bookstores, writers will have the ability to
reach selected audiences through an efficient delivery system, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   But he also thinks that an elite of internationally successful
authors will develop, probably numbering no more than 25. And, he
added, it will probably be impossible for authors to break into
those ranks unless they write in English.
</P>
<P>
   He holds that view, in part, because he thinks that English will
become an increasingly dominant force in commerce _ the common
language of business by the next generation. And Bertelsmann is
already shifting in that direction, according to Middelhoff, who
noted that communications about major company issues were written
first in English and then translated to German.
</P>
<P>
   With most of Bertelsmann's revenue coming from outside Germany,
Middelhoff said it was important to stress the company's global
reach and its corporate culture _ a decentralized structure with
local, independent managers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are Bertelsmann with a specific culture,'' Middelhoff said.
``And this specific culture is not influenced by one special
country.''

EDITORS WEIGH WHETHER WOMEN ARE MINORITY JOURNALISTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By FELICITY BARRINGER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the months after the issue of ethnic diversity in newsrooms
exploded at the annual meeting of the American Society of Newspaper
Editors in April, the development of an overarching statement of
principles, goals and strategies for increasing the numbers of
black, Asian, Hispanic and Native American journalists was one of
the group's top priorities.
</P>
<P>
   The issue of women in the newsroom was not on the front burner.
</P>
<P>
   But as the governing board of the editors' society prepares to
meet in Miami Tuesday, a proposal that women be counted in the
annual newsroom census of minority journalists will most likely
provoke at least as much debate as the broader diversity goals,
according to several of the editors involved.
</P>
<P>
   The census, conducted since 1978, marks the industry's progress
toward the goal, set by the society two decades ago, that ethnic
minorities represent 15 percent of newsroom employees by 2000. In
April, with hope of success dim, the society's board proposed to
revise the goal to 20 percent by 2010.
</P>
<P>
   While the number of women in newsrooms is unknown, all involved
agree that they far outnumber minorities, who constitute 11.5
percent of the 54,700 journalists working at newspapers nationwide.
Minorities made up more than 26 percent of the nation's population
in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of the plan to include women in the census say that it
could distract newspaper executives from the goal of bringing more
minority journalists into newsrooms. Proponents say they have no
intention of diluting the push for ethnic diversity. All they want
is data that are unobtainable elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody is keeping track'' of women in the newsroom, said
Sharon Rosenhause, managing editor of The San Francisco Examiner.
Narda Zacchino, an associate editor at The Los Angeles Times,
added: ``There's no harm in counting women. It's just an additional
number.''
</P>
<P>
   Both women, who are members of the society's diversity
committee, agree that increased ethnic diversity is the main goal.
Counting women, they both said, would not interfere. Members of
their committee agreed, voting in August to include women in the
annual census.
</P>
<P>
   But the draft statement prepared seven weeks later by the
society's top officers for tomorrow's meeting left women out.
</P>
<P>
   Rich Oppel, secretary of the society's board, explained that
``it's very important to address the issue of women in leadership
in newsrooms.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll do it,'' he continued. ``I just don't think the proper
way to do it is to bolt it on the diversity issue before us
today.'' Oppel, editor of The Austin American-Statesman, added, ``I
worry that including women in this census would complicate
matters.''
</P>
<P>
   The mission statement that is the centerpiece of the new draft
declares that ``the nation's newsrooms must reflect the racial
diversity of American society as soon as possible _ but no later
than 2025.''
</P>
<P>
   ``At a minimum,'' it continues, ``all newspapers should employ
journalists of color and every newspaper should reflect the
diversity of its community.'' The census is listed as one of four
strategies for achieving the goals.
</P>
<P>
   For all the intensity of the debate, the document's force is
symbolic. The editors' group has no authority over the hiring
policies of any newspaper. Its leadership can exhort, cajole and
show colleagues how to recruit, train and retain minorities. It can
enforce nothing.
</P>
<P>
   The board does have authority, though, over the newsroom census,
which counts blacks, Hispanics, Native Americans and Asians. The
survey shows that gains in the numbers of minority employees, once
rapid, have slowed, while the percentage of minorities in the
population accelerated.

 By BERNARD WEINRAUB    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOLLYWOOD _ Marty Adelstein, a partner at the Endeavor talent
agency in Beverly Hills, vividly recalled his first day at the
upstart company three years ago when he walked into his cramped
office situated then above a hamburger restaurant. He picked up the
phone to dial one of his top clients, David Kelley, the
writer-producer of hit shows like ``Ally McBeal'' and ``The
Practice.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The lights went out in the whole building and the phones went
dead,'' said Adelstein, 39, who had left the powerful Creative
Artists Agency to serve as an owner in the fledgling Endeavor
Agency. ``I was terrified. I thought, `What have I done?'''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, he's done quite well.
</P>
<P>
   Endeavor, which began in March 1995 when four top agents quit
their jobs at International Creative Management, opened makeshift
offices and did not take salaries for a year, has emerged as what
the trade paper Daily Variety called a significant player in the
cutthroat and potentially vastly lucrative world of talent
agencies. Its 10 partners are now believed to earn seven-figure
incomes.
</P>
<P>
   Now situated in sleek offices on Wilshire Boulevard, Endeavor
has endured some setbacks and is still struggling to forge a
significant movie division, but the agency has, in a relatively
short time, turned into a formidable and high-profile one. And it
has done so by breaking a number of rules, including, until
recently, maintaining an unusual 10-man partnership that runs the
agency instead of one or two people.
</P>
<P>
   Its growth is underscored by the fact that Endeavor is
relatively small in contrast to the other players, like the
Creative Artists Agency and International Creative Management. It
now has a staff of 70, including 30 agents, representing more than
300 clients ranging from Kelley and Larry David, a creator of
``Seinfeld,'' to actors like Adam Sandler, Edward Norton, Lisa
Kudrow, Bill Paxton and Bette Midler, to directors like Jon
Turteltaub (``Phenomenon''), Brad Silberling (``City of Angels''),
Philip Noyce (``Clear and Present Danger''), Bruce Beresford
(``Driving Miss Daisy'') and Kevin Smith (``Clerks''). The agency
also represents the television work of James Cameron, director of
``Titanic.''
</P>
<P>
   Endeavor's success rests heavily on its clients in TV, where
syndication fees and extravagant contracts for a handful of
writer-producers can make agencies wealthy. Endeavor not only
represents Kelley, one of the highest-priced writer-producers in
television, but Bonnie and Terry Turner (``Third Rock From the
Sun''), Glen Morgan and Jim Wong (``The X-Files'') and the
co-creator and executive producer of ``King of the Hill,'' Greg
Daniels.
</P>
<P>
   For the current television season, Endeavor represents J.J.
Abrams and Matt Reeves, who created the WB show ``Felicity,'' and
the screenwriter Aaron Sorkin, the writer-producer of ``Sports
Night.''
</P>
<P>
   One lawyer estimated that ``King of the Hill'' was a
``guaranteed home run'' for Endeavor, probably earning the agency
tens of millions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   On the film side, Endeavor has compiled a strong list of writers
and a handful of directors, and stepped only recently into the
business of representing actors. Last month, Brian Swardstrom, a
36-year-old agent-turned-manager, joined Endeavor as a partner and
brought along clients like Norton, Paxton and Parker Posey.
Swardstrom's Manhattan office near Soho will now serve as
Endeavor's New York beachhead.
</P>
<P>
   Paxton, who starred in the film ``Twister,'' had been
represented by the three biggest talent agencies in the last few
years _ Creative Artists, International Creative Management and the
William Morris Agency. His comment was typical of a successful
actor who is not in the Tom Cruise-Tom Hanks money league. ``These
big agencies have so many people they're trying to cover, and I
felt I was just getting lost in the shuffle,'' Paxton said. ``Part
of the problem is these big earners naturally get more attention.''
</P>
<P>
   But other new clients were plainly concerned. Turteltaub said he
went to Endeavor because of his friendship with his agent, David
Lonner. ``Certainly when you go to a smaller agency you lose the
bully factor _ the ability of a large agency to play the bully on
your behalf with either a studio or a network,'' he said. ``You
lose access to other clients of that specific agency. It is a
concern. But what you gain is sticking with a person whom you
believe in and trust.''
</P>
<P>
   Rival agents said that Endeavor's expansion into films could be
short-circuited by its relative small size. Without many A-list
film directors, who are at the bigger agencies, Endeavor may find
it difficult to lure an array of top or even mid-range stars. This
could turn Endeavor into a top-heavy TV agency without influence in
its movie division.
</P>
<P>
   The agency seems to have been started in the same manner that
Michael Ovitz, Ron Meyer _ now the president of Universal Studios _
and a handful of other young William Morris agents began Creative
Artists in 1975. Creative Artists started mostly as a television
agency, then turned into a powerhouse.
</P>
<P>
   Endeavor was born less than auspiciously. Four agents _ Ariel
Emanuel, Tom Strickler, David Greenblatt and Rick Rosen _ quit
their jobs at International Creative Management shortly after
midnight on March 29, 1995, hauling out files to cars. Legal action
was threatened against them, but nothing resulted. The partners
were joined six months later by Adelstein, a top television agent.
A year later three other agents _ Lonner, Adam Venit and Doug
Robinson _ defected from Creative Artists.
</P>
<P>
   Emanuel said the agency opened with a $500,000 bank credit line,
in which the partners' homes were held as collateral. Strickler,
who represents some top film writers, said, ``There was one crazy
moment for me when I thought, `If worse comes to worse, I'll lose
my house but I've got to be able to feed my dogs.' So I bought six
months worth of dog food and stored it in the bedroom.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Surprisingly, most of the writers and directors stayed with
agents who moved to Endeavor. But actors _ many of them anxious
about the small size of the agency _ were fickle. Wesley Snipes
left his agent at Endeavor to join William Morris. Anne Heche went
to Creative Artists. Will Smith opted to remain at Creative Artists
instead of joining his agent at Endeavor. Leonardo DiCaprio did not
want to choose between Venit and Creative Artists; he has no agent
and is represented by a manager. Another blow for Endeavor was when
the comedian Chris Farley died two weeks after he signed with the
agency.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Rabineau, a 40-year-old Endeavor agent, said the agency
was made up of friends. Such comments result in much eye-rolling
among rival agents who say that friendship in Hollywood only goes
so far. Personal collisions are bound to take place at Endeavor,
where some clients of television agents like Emanuel and Adelstein
earn far more money than clients of film agents, said several rival
agents.
</P>
<P>
   But Emanuel, whose brother is Rahm Emanuel, the White House
presidential adviser, said: ``People in this town dig up and create
conflicts. We all came from big agencies where people fought and
competed over everything _ money, clients, everything. We set up
this agency to escape that. We won't treat each other like the way
we were treated.''
</P>
<P>
   But partly to meet the criticisms that 10 men cannot totally
control a talent agency _ there are no female partners _ Endeavor
recently created a three-man management team to oversee the
company. The three are Emanuel, Adelstein and Rabineau. ``Hard to
believe, but you know what?'' Emanuel said. ``We respect each
other.''

   Borders are as flimsy as bookmarks in the global realm where
Thomas Middelhoff is preparing to take power as the new chief
executive of the Bertelsmann media and publishing conglomerate.

   On a September morning, Middelhoff, 44, rises to field questions

afternoon, he is in a dark, wood-paneled room of the 21 Club in
Manhattan to go through the same business ritual in English.

answers in both languages. Five years from now, Middelhoff
declares, upper-level employees at Bertelsmann headquarters in
Guetersloh will speak English as the official corporate language.
And for those who blunder by referring to Bertelsmann as a German
conglomerate, Middelhoff, a self-described global citizen,
vigorously and frequently offers corrections.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not a German company,'' he insisted, adding, ``We are a
real global company.''
</P>
<P>
   That sentiment is spreading in the world's $80 billion-a-year
book market, which is not only becoming more concentrated among
mega-publishers, but also is increasingly becoming a borderless
territory with the expansion of electronic bookselling and global
deals. Such deals cross nations and languages and range from
Bertelsmann's purchase of Random House and its recent partnership
in Barnes &AMP; Noble's electronic bookstore to moves by the largest
French publisher, Hachette Livre, to acquire a majority stake in a
British consumer book company, Orion Publishing Group.
</P>
<P>
   With these global shifts has come a new generation of issues for
the publishing industry _ from the protection of
intellectual-property rights and the balance of power between
individual authors and behemoth publishers to concerns about
whether consolidation will crowd out smaller houses and lead to
homogenous literature.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whales are eating the whales,'' said Martin Levin, a
former publishing executive and lawyer who specializes in mergers
and acquisitions of publishing companies. ``It used to be that the
whales were eating the minnows. Now the appetites are so much
bigger. This is a watershed moment in publishing, where we have
never seen this kind of concentration before with global ownership
and the big getting bigger.''
</P>
<P>
   The zest for global reach has also taken hold at chain
booksellers like the Borders Group, which is preparing for eventual
superstore saturation in the United States by opening branches in
Singapore, Britain and Australia. The electronic bookseller,
Amazon.com, this month is opening two European Web site versions of
its operation with distribution points in Slough, England, and
Regensburg, Germany.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do think that the world is becoming a smaller place every
year that goes by,'' said Jeffrey Bezos, Amazon's founder and chief
executive, who said that the growing expansion of electronic book
sales could lead to more diversity and choice in literature.
</P>
<P>
   But he also said that the increasing consolidation of publishers
bears watching. ``If you get too much concentration on the
publishing side,'' he said, ``then you could start to get problems
with ideas and the ability of authors to get multiple outlets for
their work. If you took it to an extreme, it could be bad for the
industry. It could be bad for society.''
</P>
<P>
   To a certain extent, this global fever has spread to midsized
and small American publishers, which in a variety of ways are
casting about for partners, acquisitions or alliances to publish
directly into foreign markets, a trend propelled by the slow growth
of book sales.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's tough enough to make money in the U.S. market,'' said
Steven Schragis, publisher of Carol Publishing Group, which last
year foundered in an attempt to merge with Batsford Publishing in
London. ``There's always been the avenue of selling your rights to
foreign publishers, but you can make more money by exploiting your
own copyrights directly _ i.e., release it directly yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Prima Publishing, an independent company in Rocklin,
Calif., absorbed the employees of an inactive German publisher to
establish Prima Deutschland, which will try to tap the German
market for games with a division publishing game-strategy books.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's incredibly myopic for any company in the world that is
truly becoming a global village not to use its core strength to
expand overseas,'' said Ben Dominitz, Prima's founder and chief
executive. ``We tend to look at technology companies for models and
not publishing companies.''
</P>
<P>
   The bigger shifts in global ownership and book selling are so
new that no one is quite sure what impact, if any, such changes
could have on literature and culture.
</P>
<P>
   But the trends are pronounced enough that the chairman of the
Frankfurt Book Fair, Roland Ulmer, sought to draw attention to the
changes earlier this month in an opening speech at the huge annual
bazaar of books and publishers from all over the world.
</P>
<P>
   Ulmer noted that by as early as next year, more than 90 percent
of the American book market will be controlled by the 20 largest
competitors. On the technical, medical and scientific side of
publishing, the concentration is even greater, he said, with three
foreign companies dominating 90 percent of the U.S. market.
</P>
<P>
   Within the sprawling halls of the Frankfurt Book Fair, the joke
was that there was more gossip this year about buying companies
than of buying books. At panel discussions, futurists with
technology backgrounds floated the heretical view that copyright
protection was a medieval concept, arguing that it had no place in
a digital world, where information could be transferred with a few
computer-keyboard clicks.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   The rights directors of publishing houses held their own forums
to debate how globalization and electronic commerce had shifted the
international flow of books and the frontiers of language markets.
</P>
<P>
   The rights to a book generally are not global; for example,
selling a book that was published in the United States in a foreign
country may violate a British publisher's rights to sell that same
book in Britain. But those territorial boundaries are hard to
enforce at an electronic bookstore, which may not always know which
book is the British version or the American version.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting at his own cramped booth at the Frankfurt fair, Andre
Schiffrin, director of the not-for-profit New Press in New York,
said he was certain his public-interest publishing house would feel
the effects of globalization.
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, it is to his advantage because he expects some
authors to start coming to him for an alternative from the
corporate publishing houses. But he said the new bonds between
Bertelsmann and Barnes &AMP; Noble provided further impetus to seek new
sales and marketing outlets, like public forums to promote his
authors and their ideas.
</P>
<P>
   Such global shifts in ownership and book selling are also viewed
warily by authors.
</P>
<P>
   For Stephen King, whose best-selling books are also successful
in other countries, globalizaton is the ``literary equivalent of
grazing the rain forest to make hamburgers.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It lowers the IQ any time there is consolidation and there is
more of a focus on bestsellers,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The National Writers Union, a New York-based group with a
membership of more than 4,000 freelance writers and authors, has
decided that it needs to become global by forming alliances with
other international unions so it can follow the activities of large
multinational publishers, according to Jonathan Tasini, the union's
president.
</P>
<P>
   ``What writers are now starting to see is what we've seen in
other industries,'' he said. ``Their industries are being run by
companies with no national flag and when that happens you feel a
loss of control,'' said Tasini, who added that he expected that as
the companies grew, they would look for ways to economize, such as
through tougher negotiations with authors.
</P>
<P>
   At least three of the top American publishing houses _ two of
them newly merged companies _ are now reviewing their standard
forms of contracts with authors. Contracts are the critical
agreements that define the relationships between authors and
publishers, establishing what a writer will be paid and who has the
rights to sell a title in foreign countries.
</P>
<P>
   At Bertelsmann's Random House, contracts are under review, a
routine step in the wake of the merger with Bantam Doubleday Dell,
to edit out anachronistic language, a company spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   Middelhoff of Bertelsmann, who will be formally promoted to
chief executive in November, said that despite the criticism and
concern of some authors, globalization of ownership and bookselling
might in some ways increase the diversity of voices in literature.
Through electronic bookstores, writers will have the ability to
reach selected audiences through an efficient delivery system, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   But he also thinks that an elite of internationally successful
authors will develop, probably numbering no more than 25. And, he
added, it will probably be impossible for authors to break into
those ranks unless they write in English.
</P>
<P>
   He holds that view, in part, because he thinks that English will
become an increasingly dominant force in commerce _ the common
language of business by the next generation. And Bertelsmann is
already shifting in that direction, according to Middelhoff, who
noted that communications about major company issues were written
first in English and then translated to German.
</P>
<P>
   With most of Bertelsmann's revenue coming from outside Germany,
Middelhoff said it was important to stress the company's global
reach and its corporate culture _ a decentralized structure with
local, independent managers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are Bertelsmann with a specific culture,'' Middelhoff said.
``And this specific culture is not influenced by one special
country.''

 By MICHAEL M. WEINSTEIN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The case of United States vs. Microsoft Corp., the government's
most aggressive move against a monopolist in almost 25 years, is
playing out against a century of antitrust laws so broadly worded
and court rulings so ambiguous that both sides are citing the same
rulings to support their opposing arguments.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the outcome of the trial, scheduled to begin Monday in
U.S. District Court in Washington, an almost certain appeal will
leave to the Supreme Court the task of bringing legal order to 100
years of clashing antitrust doctrines.
</P>
<P>
   The case focuses on Microsoft's Windows, the operating system
that controls about 90 percent of all personal computers sold
today. The government says its objective is to curb illegal
monopolistic business practices that threaten to render large parts
of the economy vulnerable to the vicissitudes of a single company.
Microsoft asserts that the case is intended to give the government
control over which features can be added to Windows.
</P>
<P>
   However grand the economic stakes, the legal dispute is narrow.
The government says that Microsoft's contracts with computer
manufacturers and with companies that provide access to the
Internet illegally stifle competition.
</P>
<P>
   The contracts prohibit manufacturers from substituting Netscape
Communications Corp.'s Navigator browser for Microsoft's Internet
Explorer. They also prohibit them from removing from the Windows
main screen, or desktop, links to sites on the World Wide Web run
by Microsoft or its partners.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's contracts with companies that connect people to the
Internet and with businesses that sell goods and services on the
Web require favored treatment for Internet Explorer over Navigator
in exchange for links on the Windows desktop. In the wake of the
lawsuit, Microsoft has voluntarily dropped some of these
requirements, though it could reinstate them at will.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft says that its contracts are legal because they produce
tangible benefits for customers, including easier Internet access.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department says that the bundling of Explorer with
Windows 95 and the inclusion of the browser as part of Windows 98
amount to ``tying,'' an illegal practice that forces customers of
one product to purchase another. The contracts with manufacturers
and Internet services are illegal, the government says, because
they are intended not only to create a monopoly in the browser
market but to protect Microsoft's existing monopoly in operating
systems.
</P>
<P>
   The latter threat is key, according to the Justice Department.
Browsers have the potential, like an operating system, to act as a
software platform on which other programs run. So contracts
intended to drive browsers out of the market would also insulate
the Windows monopoly.
</P>
<P>
   Many antitrust experts say the problem facing the Justice
Department is that the courts have provided no clear definition of
tying and no clear guidelines for determining when contracts are
illegally exclusionary.
</P>
<P>
   Professor Lawrence White of New York University, who was chief
economist of the Justice Department's antitrust division in the
early 1980s, says that the courts treat tying as an unusual
practice when in fact it is ubiquitous. No one, he said, ``would
challenge the right of manufacturers to tie erasers to the tip of
pencils, tires to an automobile or buttons to shirts.''
</P>
<P>
   His point, shared widely among economists, is that some tying
benefits consumers if, for example, it results in products that are
easier to use or enables a company to recover development costs.
</P>
<P>
   But tying can be bad if it locks in monopoly power. The courts,
White says, have not offered enough guidance for distinguishing
good tying from bad, which is the nub of the legal dispute.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft says it needs only to show that bundling Windows and
Explorer passes what might be called a ``gross'' consumer benefits
test _ that it offers an immediate benefit, whether or not it
causes long-term damage to competition and, therefore, ultimately
to consumers.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department says that Microsoft's practices must
clear a higher hurdle: yielding ``net'' consumer benefits that are
immediate and large enough to balance possible long-term harm to
competition.
</P>
<P>
   So which test of consumer benefits satisfies antitrust laws? The
simple answer is that no one knows for sure, which is why both
sides can reasonably cite the same cases without fear of
embarrassment.
</P>
<P>
   Consider a 1985 case, Aspen Skiing Co. vs. Aspen Highlands
Skiing Corp., and a 1951 case, Lorain Journal Co. vs. United
States.
</P>
<P>
   In the first, Aspen Skiing, the owner of three major ski runs in
Aspen, Colo. _ the monopolist _ had for years sold a ticket in
cooperation with Aspen Highlands, a competitor, that gave skiers
access to both companies' runs. When Aspen Skiing unilaterally
canceled the agreement, its rival's revenues shriveled and the
rival sued. The Supreme Court ruled that Aspen Skiing had violated
antitrust laws because there was no evidence its action helped
consumers.
</P>
<P>
   In the Lorain Journal case, the only local newspaper in Lorain,
Ohio, refused to sell advertising to companies that advertised on a
new radio station. Here, too, the Supreme Court ruled that the
exclusionary practice did nothing to benefit consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, in Aspen Skiing, the court even forced the monopolist to
do business with its rival, a precedent that augurs well for the
Justice Department, which seeks to force Microsoft to install
Netscape's browser alongside its own.
</P>
<P>
   But Charles Rule, a legal consultant to Microsoft, says that in
both cases the courts threw out exclusionary practices only because
they offered no consumer benefit. The courts, he argues, never
pounced on practices that resulted in lower prices or better
products or service.
</P>
<P>
   Nor did the courts in either case call for balancing immediate
benefits against hypothetical long-term harm. Rule argues that
Microsoft's practices produce demonstrable consumer benefits.
Besides, he says, unlike the actions taken by The Lorain Journal or
Aspen Skiing, Microsoft's contracts do not prevent consumers from
installing Netscape's browser or from using the Web sites of
Microsoft's rivals.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   In truth, though, neither case answered what consumer benefit
test should apply to product design.
</P>
<P>
   In Jefferson Parish Hospital District No. 2 et al. vs. Hyde,
another case cited by both sides, the Supreme Court in 1984
recognized that surgeons and anesthesiologists provide an
integrated service. Yet, the court said, a hospital with monopoly
power would still not be allowed to force surgical patients to use
its panel of anesthesiologists if consumers wanted to purchase the
two services separately. That principle could undercut Microsoft's
defense that the functional interdependence of Windows and Explorer
requires bundling.
</P>
<P>
   But Microsoft will point to a strong concurring opinion that
called for a tougher standard for the government to meet when it
alleges tying. Microsoft will also draw support from several court
rulings that allowed IBM to change the design of its computers in
ways that made it hard for vendors to attach peripheral equipment.
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps Microsoft's best argument is that nowhere has the
government identified a single case in which the courts explicitly
called for throwing out a tied product on the basis of a balancing
test. The courts, Microsoft will emphasize, steer clear of
redesigning technically sophisticated products.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department's rejoinder is to note that the sole
purpose of antitrust law is to protect consumers, so it makes no
sense to bless practices that provide a dollar's worth of benefits
today but, by stamping out competition, drive prices up by $1,000
tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department will ask the court to at least insist
that monopolists use the least exclusionary means possible to
achieve whatever services they provide customers.
</P>
<P>
   Experts agree that the courts will subject Microsoft's
restrictive contracts with Internet companies to a balancing test.
But exactly how the court will decide whether consumers are helped
or hurt is up for grabs. A balancing test would have the courts
weigh the immediate benefits to consumers of one-click access to
Internet sites and of features of a bundled Windows-Explorer
package versus the harm over time of diminished competition in the
markets for browsers and operating systems.
</P>
<P>
   But a test that makes good sense in theory can prove fiendishly
difficult to use in practice. ``Balancing tests are impossibly
difficult and arbitrary,'' said Rep. Thomas Campbell, R-Calif., who
is a former law professor at Stanford University. ``The practical
effect of balancing is to hand defendants like Microsoft almost
certain victory.''
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft argues _ and many antitrust experts agree _ that the
courts have in fact gravitated away from a balancing test toward a
simpler ``predation'' test for exclusionary contracts. Under this
standard, a contract is illegal only if it is intended to drive out
competition and thus to pave the way for a monopolist to raise
prices later. Microsoft will have an easier time defending itself
against a charge of predation, which amounts to victimizing its
customers, than it would defending itself against a charge that its
bundled product does consumers slightly more harm than good.
</P>
<P>
   The antitrust record, says William Baxter, who headed the
antitrust division under President Reagan, is littered with
``contradictory, ambiguous and sometimes nonsensical'' verdicts.
</P>
<P>
   He and other legal experts agree that if nothing else, that
record leaves plenty of legal leeway for the Supreme Court, should
it hear the Microsoft case, to stiffen the spine of the antitrust
law.

SHERMAN ACT OF 1890 IS KEY TOOL IN CASE AGAINST MICROSOFT 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The legal tool that the government is using in its assault on
Microsoft Corp. _ the Sherman Antitrust Act of 1890 _ is brief,
vague and malleable. The combination has meant that this bedrock
statute of antitrust policy has been at turns toothless and
powerful over the years, depending on the politics and economics of
the day as interpreted by the courts.
</P>
<P>
   Sponsored by Sen. John Sherman, an Ohio Republican who was the
younger brother of the Civil War general William Tecumseh Sherman,
the act was passed as a nod to a popular backlash against the rise
of the industrial trusts in oil, steel and railroads. Farmers,
laborers and small-business owners _ sizable voting groups _
resented the trusts as vehicles of concentrated power. But the
trusts, large national holding corporations, were viewed by many
others as engines of modernization and industrialization.
</P>
<P>
   Economists at the time opposed the Sherman Act, and the law that
Congress passed was a vaguely worded compromise. No one knew what
impact it would have, but one senator, quoted in Matthew
Josephson's ``The Robber Barons,'' explained that nearly everyone
agreed that ``something must be flung out to appease the restive
masses.''
</P>
<P>
   The act's two key provisions, Sections 1 and 2, mention
``conspiracy,'' ``restraint of trade'' and ``attempt to
monopolize.'' Yet while the Sherman Act is now interpreted as the
Magna Carta of competition, it never uses the term. After it was
passed, critics of the trusts derided the ``impenetrable'' language
of the Sherman Act and called it the Swiss Cheese Act.
</P>
<P>
   But by the early 1900s, the political climate had changed. The
growing antagonism for the trusts, especially as income gaps
widened, was tapped by an avowed trustbuster, Theodore Roosevelt,
who became president in 1901.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Sherman Act has always been an elastic piece of social
legislation, used to attack perceived exploitation and the
aggregation of power,'' said Eleanor Fox, a professor at the New
York University Law School.
</P>
<P>
   The model trust _ and the principal target of the trustbusters _
was Standard Oil. Shrewdly, Roosevelt made a distinction between
good trusts, which thrived because of their superior efficiency,
and bad trusts, which grew not as the result of inevitable economic
forces but because of unfair business practices.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the 1880s and '90s, Standard Oil's rivals had
complained about the company and the business practices of its
founder, John D. Rockefeller. But during those years, the price of
kerosene _ burned to light the nation's homes _declined steadily.
So Standard Oil, it could could reasonably be argued, was an
``enterprising monopoly.''
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1900s, though, Standard Oil raised prices in the
United States to prop up its profits at a time it was engaged in a
price war against Royal Dutch/Shell in Europe, where Standard Oil
did face genuine competition. When consumers were hurt by the
Standard Oil monopoly, popular support for antitrust action against
the company swelled, encouraged by Roosevelt and his successor,
William Howard Taft. The federal suit against Standard Oil was
filed in 1906, and the Supreme Court approved the breakup of the
company in 1911.
</P>
<P>
   Standard Oil and the Microsoft case, historians observe, have
some common themes. Both were dominant companies of their day, and
Bill Gates, the Microsoft chairman, has been called a modern
Rockefeller.
</P>
<P>
   ``But there is no presidential involvement and there is no real
consumer dissatisfaction in the Microsoft case,'' said Ron Chernow,
author of ``Titan,'' a best-selling biography of Rockefeller.
</P>
<P>
   ``And Rockefeller,'' Chernow added, ``never went through the
kind of honeymoon period of widespread public adulation and
favorable press coverage as Bill Gates has had.''

 By ALEX KUCZYNSKI   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In 1996, Mark Golin was living in Allentown, Pa.,
editing a Web site for Prevention magazine and addressing elderly
readers' health questions when a call came from Bonnie Fuller,
editor of Cosmopolitan.
</P>
<P>
   Eighteen months later, after a stint as deputy editor of
Cosmopolitan under Ms. Fuller, Golin is the editor of Maxim
magazine, the current flavor of the month in the field of men's
magazines. Matt Lauer is fond of reading jokes from Maxim on The
Today Show; the Pulitzer Prize-winning memoirist Frank McCourt even
attended the Maxim ``End of Seinfeld'' party last fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was at Cosmo for about eight or nine months, and that was
fun,'' Golin said, spreading his arms in an all-embracing,
Zorba-the-Greek-like gesture. ``What's not to like? It was me _ and
loads and loads of women.''
</P>
<P>
   Suffice it to say, Golin _ with jokes that are too dirty to
print in a daily newspaper and his indifference to the sartorial
matters concerning most men's magazine editors _ is the very
embodiment of Maxim, which magazine consultants describe as the
Playboy of the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   At a time when the competition in the men's magazine market is
heated _ the field is crowded with new titles like Bob Guccione
Jr.'s Gear and Disney's ESPN _ and most men's titles are aiming for
a sophisticated, advertiser-friendly audience, Maxim, based in New
York, is an unlikely success story. Unlike GQ or Details, which
encourage sophistication, Maxim encourages its readers to exist in
a perpetual state of chest-thumping, girl-chasing, adolescent
jokesterism. Semi-nude starlets grace each cover; inside,
advertisements for beer and consumer electronics rub elbows with
articles about how to get back at the boss. If Maxim had a Man of
the Year, he would be Austin Powers.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a guy inside all men,'' said Golin, ``and whether
you're pumping gas in Iowa or you're working on Wall Street, you
can't ignore your inner guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Felix Dennis, the multimillionaire British publisher who
publicizes the fact that he dates 10 women simultaneously,
introduced Maxim to the British in 1995; it is now third in the
British field of ``lad'' magazines, as they are called _ volumes
devoted mostly to sex, adventure and humor. Loaded and FHM _ the
letters stand for ``For Him Magazine'' _ have been looking at the
U.S. market.
</P>
<P>
   The London-based Dennis Publishing, which produces 21 titles,
introduced the American version of Maxim in 1997. Maxim's
publishers are optimistic, projecting a guaranteed rate base of
650,000 for January 1999 and profitability by the end of next year,
two years ahead of schedule. Since Golin arrived in January,
circulation has risen from 393,977 to 536,455 for the June issue.
</P>
<P>
   For now, Maxim is outpacing the stalwarts. With an average
newsstand circulation of 192,409 for each issue in the first half
of 1998, Maxim beat newsstand sales of titles like Details (with
157,815) from Conde Nast Publications, a unit of Advance
Publications; Hearst Corp.'s Esquire (with 84,066), Wenner Media's
Men's Journal (76,220), and P.O.V. (12,108), which is financed by
an arm of Freedom Communications. Conde Nast's GQ sold 285,853
newsstand copies per issue for the same period and Men's Health
from Rodale Press Inc. sold 385,227.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem with men's magazines now is that they're all
vertical,'' said Golin, who noted that Maxim, by contrast, is not
about one subject _ like fashion or sports _ but many subjects, and
they are all anchored by his demented sense of humor. A November
feature titled ``If Men Ruled the World'' includes entries like
this one: ``Instead of an expensive engagement ring, you could
present your wife-to-be with a giant foam hand that said `You're
(NU)1!''' One recent article, titled ``The Man With the $100,000
Breasts,'' was recently optioned for film by Fox Searchlight.
</P>
<P>
   ``GQ is fine if you're interested in fashion and want a magazine
that every month is going to reinforce the fact that you had better
have a closetful of this stuff or you're getting nowhere,'' Golin
said.
</P>
<P>
   Details is for a reader who feels he is ``Mr.
Pop-Culture-Groovy,'' he added, describing Esquire as ``an
ortolan.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's this rare bird they eat in the South of France,'' he
explained. ``It's just too precious.''
</P>
<P>
   Critics are quick to point out that Maxim is, well, vulgar, and
that vulgarity has a short shelf life.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've been very successful in targeting the low end,'' Linda
Mason, publisher of Details, said. ``But will it last? I don't
know.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a fun bathroom read,'' said Drew Massey, publisher of
P.O.V., a magazine that focuses on young men and business. Massey
said that Maxim's robust newsstand sales did not mean it was
building a loyal subscriber base. ``They don't have readers coming
back and developing a subscriber relationship with the magazine,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Maxim publisher Lance Ford denied that, saying that Maxim's
conversion rate from newsstand to subscription is 10 percent. The
industry average is generally considered to be 3 percent, say
industry analysts.
</P>
<P>
   Ford _ formerly the advertising director at The New Yorker and
associate publisher of Bon Appetit _ has lured advertisers like
Ford Motor Co., General Motors Corp. and AT&AMP;T, typically
conservative corporations when it comes to ad placement.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no doubt there's a moral majority running this country
and running big business,'' Ford said. ``A lot of the big companies
said, `Don't come to us first, we're not ready yet.'''
</P>
<P>
   David Verklin, chief executive of Carat North America, an
advertising agency, said, ``Lance could talk a dog off a meat
truck.'' Last year, Verklin successfully encouraged the Saturn
division of Mercury to advertise in Maxim.
</P>
<P>
   While Ford and Golin behave like a pair of gung-ho Manhattan
bachelors, both are married. Golin _ who is also a classically
trained violinist and favors Bach variations _ has two young
children with his wife, a former advertising executive.
</P>
<P>
   ``But don't put that in!'' he shouted, joking. ``It'll ruin
everything.''

 By JOEL BRINKLEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The government's antitrust scrutiny of Microsoft,
the world's largest independent software company, has spanned
Republican and Democratic administrations and involved hundreds of
government lawyers and investigators. But it has by no means been
an example of consistent, coordinated public policy. Nor, by all
accounts, of politics.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, like the software industry itself, the government's
pursuit of Microsoft has taken leaps, hit dead ends and evolved in
ways no one could have controlled or predicted back when it started
in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   It was in November of that year, on a hot afternoon at a
computer-industry convention in Las Vegas, Nev., that Bill Gates,
Microsoft's chairman, looked like he'd been dragged to the news
conference with a senior executive from IBM _ which at the time
dominated Microsoft and the entire computer industry.
</P>
<P>
   The two companies _ IBM, then the leading maker of personal
computers and Microsoft, the leader in PC operating system software
_ were collaborating on the design and marketing of a new operating
system called OS/2. But Microsoft was also beginning to sell a
competing product, Windows.
</P>
<P>
   The industry trade press was full of worried articles: which
system was going to become the new standard?
</P>
<P>
   With Gates standing uncomfortably at his side, James Cannavino,
an IBM divisional president, said that the two companies wanted to
``clear the air.'' OS/2 was the future, he said. As for Windows, he
added, it would remain a niche product for under-equipped
computers. Windows, he asserted, would never receive all the
advanced features of OS/2.
</P>
<P>
   Gates certainly did not look happy. But he did not disagree.
</P>
<P>
   The news conference got little attention, just a few articles
deep inside newspapers and trade publications. But a few weeks
later, Norris Washington, a senior antitrust lawyer with the
Federal Trade Commission, happened to read one of those articles,
in Byte magazine.
</P>
<P>
   ``IBM and Microsoft have now defined their unified vision of
graphical operating environments,'' the article said, ``and it
looks sort of like a U.S. economic model,'' divided into lower-,
middle- and upper-class products.
</P>
<P>
   As Washington saw it, IBM and Microsoft were colluding to divide
the operating-system market _ a potential violation of antitrust
law.
</P>
<P>
   Soon the FTC staff opened an investigation of Microsoft and IBM
And since that small first step, Microsoft has been under
unrelenting scrutiny from federal antitrust investigators for a
constantly evolving series of allegations and charges, month after
month, year after year, for the last nine years.
</P>
<P>
   Now comes the antitrust trial scheduled to begin on Monday, with
a multiplicity of charges woven of threads drawn from more than a
dozen different investigative inquiries during that nine-year span.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft, today the most feared company in the software
business and carrying a stock-market value of nearly $234 billion,
presents a huge and highly visible antitrust target.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, while the company's allies ask, ``What is the Clinton
administration's political agenda in going after Microsoft?'' the
answer seems to be there is none.
</P>
<P>
   In interviews, more than a dozen current and former senior
antitrust officials _ whether friends of the government or of
Microsoft _ all say the Justice Department's antitrust suit is a
natural outgrowth of the previous investigations. As for politics,
all the officials agreed that the antitrust division operates
independent of the administration's political considerations.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Rule was the assistant attorney general who headed the
antitrust division during the Bush administration, and he is now a
Washington lawyer who serves as an adviser and advocate for
Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was there,'' Rule said of his Justice days, ``the White
House was punctilious in terms of never getting involved in
whatever we decided to do. There was no communication between
antitrust and other branches of government.'' Asked if he believed
that policy had changed under the Clinton administration, he said:
``Not really. I've seen nothing to suggest it.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Joel Klein heads the antitrust division now, and in an interview
dealing with his division's role in the Clinton administration's
technology policy, not specifically relating to the Microsoft case,
he said: ``There is no statutory restriction, but as a practical
matter, civil and criminal prosecutions are invariably carried out
without any political contact.''
</P>
<P>
   Klein said, by way of examples, that he might discuss merger
cases involving military or aviation industries with the Defense
Department or Transportation Department. ``But never the White
House,'' he said. ``For a significant case, we might call the White
House and say `An hour from now we are going to hold a press
conference.' ''
</P>
<P>
   ``The last time there was any interference,'' he added, ``was
the Dita Beard-ITT case.'' Mrs. Beard, a lobbyist for ITT Corp.,
was accused in 1972 of having written a memo saying that a $400,000
donation to the Republican National Convention had ``gone a long
way'' toward settling antitrust suits brought against the company
by the Nixon administration's Justice Department. The authenticity
of the memo was never proved, and Mrs. Beard always denied writing
it. In any case, Klein says, ``since Watergate, it's been
immaculate.''
</P>
<P>
   In the case of Microsoft, neither President Clinton nor Vice
President Al Gore has ever volunteered a comment. In answer to a
question during a news conference in May, just before the suit was
filed, Clinton said: ``I have taken the view that I should not
comment on matters within the Justice Department. At this time, I
do not think I should depart from that policy on this case, even
though it obviously will have a big impact on an important sector
of our economy. But I have to say, based on what I know to date, I
have confidence in the way the antitrust division in the Justice
Department has handled the matter.''
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Clinton has said nothing else about the case,
publicly at least. And Gore, who generally represents the
administration on technology issues, has never commented at all.
</P>
<P>
   In Rule's opinion, the administration would be foolish to
involve itself, even if it were politically acceptable to do so.
``It would be a little odd for the administration to push the
Justice Department in this suit,'' he said. ``It would be a policy
mistake and a political mistake. I would be hard pressed to explain
why they would do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Taking sides in the highly charged technology world is
dangerous, particularly since the Democrats rely on Silicon Valley
companies for political donations and support. In fact, the present
and former government officials all said the suit was simply a
natural extension of the inquiries conducted during the last nine
years.
</P>
<P>
   They began at the FTC. Soon after Washington read that article
in Byte, the FTC staff opened an investigation of the Windows-OS/2
question. But as has happened so often in the following years,
turns in the market made the initial inquiry irrelevant. Microsoft
abandoned its agreement with IBM, and Windows quickly grew to be
the industry standard, while OS/2 remained a cipher.
</P>
<P>
   But as that issue faded, once government investigators began
looking at Microsoft they found other things that troubled them.
</P>
<P>
   In 1991 Washington, who still works for the FTC, informed
Microsoft that the investigation was being expanded. The agency,
his letter said, was now trying to determine whether Microsoft was
using its dominant position in operating-systems software to stifle
competition in other areas. That general idea lies at the heart of
the present suit.
</P>
<P>
   One former senior FTC official said the commission staff had
confidence in the case but realized that the Reagan-era
commissioners, who had to approve any suit, might have a different
view. ``We knew the commission might have difficulty with a
monopolization case,'' the former official said. ``They hadn't
brought a case in years.''
</P>
<P>
   And in fact, in 1993 the commission voted 2-2 on the question of
whether to file formal charges. The deadlock served as a dismissal.
Then, a few months later, the Justice Department decided to pick up
the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was farther along than most cases we got,'' recalled Robert
Litan, a former senior official in the Justice Department's
antitrust division who is now at the Brookings Institution.
``Usually a case would be two or three people complaining and a few
documents,'' he said. ``But this was a fully researched record.
They gave us the files and briefed us on what they had done.''
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department lawyers picked up the same thread. ``The
general idea behind our inquiry,'' Litan said, ``was that they
should not be allowed to use their monopoly in operating systems to
cement a monopoly in other areas.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, Microsoft and the government reached a consent
agreement in which the company promised to stop forcing PC makers
to buy one copy of a Microsoft operating system for every computer
sold _ instead of one for every computer on which the operating
system, MS-DOS or Windows, was installed. The company also agreed
to stop tying the sale of one software product to the sale of
another. The charges in the present suit are similar in many ways.
</P>
<P>
   Even with the agreement, the government investigations
continued. That same year, Justice Department investigators showed
up at the offices of Netscape Communications Corp. for the first
time to ask questions about their next line of inquiry. ``America
Online had been complaining,'' a senior Netscape executive
recalled, ``because Microsoft was bundling the Microsoft Network,''
a competing online service, ``with Windows.''
</P>
<P>
   Once more, market forces overtook the investigation. The
Microsoft Network never grew particularly popular while America
Online prospered and grew. But, not surprisingly, new complaints
filled the void. In May 1995, Anne Bingaman, the assistant attorney
general who headed the antitrust division, remarked: ``We get
complaints about Microsoft all the time. We have become a kind of
Microsoft complaints center. And we take them very seriously.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, Netscape's first complaint arrived. In a letter to the
Justice Department, Netscape said that Microsoft was using its
dominance in personal-computer operating systems to force or
persuade computer makers to favor Microsoft's browser, used to
explore the World Wide Web, over the one marketed by Netscape. The
next year the Justice Department formally charged Microsoft with
violating the consent agreement by tying sales of Windows to
installation of the company's Web browser on new computers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seemed like a slam-dunk violation of the consent decree,''
a natural extension of that case, recalled Litan, who had left the
department by then.
</P>
<P>
   A Federal District Court judge agreed, but an Appeals Court
panel overturned that ruling this summer.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, last May the Justice Department and 20 state
attorneys general filed their new suit against Microsoft, which is
scheduled for trial on Monday. It contends that Microsoft has
engaged in bundling, tying and other predatory behavior similar in
many ways to the numerous previous allegations and investigations
of the last nine years.
</P>
<P>
   ``A good part of this case is just Round II of the case we dealt
with in Round I,'' in the early in the 1990s, Litan said.
</P>
<P>
   Or, as the former senior FTC official put it, ``there's
certainly a common thread that runs all the way through here.'' But
through the years that thread has been twisted, pulled and spun by
hundreds of different hands. &QL;

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Shortly before the government filed its antitrust suit against
Microsoft Corp. in May, Joel Klein, the assistant attorney general
in charge of the Justice Department's antitrust division, met with
a Silicon Valley executive. The executive recalls telling Klein
that unless a case went beyond the Internet browser market, it
would have little effect on Microsoft's power to stifle competition
across the computer industry.
</P>
<P>
   Klein replied that he understood the computer executive's
concerns. But he said time was running short and the strongest
evidence in hand involved Microsoft's battle against Netscape
Communications Corp. in the market for the so-called browser
software used for navigating the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a Netscape case,'' the executive recalls Klein saying.
</P>
<P>
   But five months later, the case that the government is bringing
to trial on Monday extends well beyond Netscape and the browser war
to embrace what it described in a recent court filing as ``a broad
pattern of anti-competitive conduct'' by Microsoft. Netscape, the
government insists, is still a prime example of the pattern _ but
only one of several examples.
</P>
<P>
   The 12-person witness list for the Justice Department and 20
states suing Microsoft reflects the new evidence added to the case
since May. James Barksdale, Netscape's president and chief
executive, will appear first, but he will be followed by executives
representing a cross section of the nation's high-technology
companies including Intel, IBM, Sun Microsystems, Apple Computer,
America Online and Intuit.
</P>
<P>
   In bringing a more ambitious, complicated case to trial than the
one it filed in May, the government has chosen a high-risk
strategy. The law states that new evidence can be added to a suit
after it is filed, but not new charges. And so, in his federal
courtroom in Washington, U.S.District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson
could decide to rule out some of the new evidence as ranging too
far afield from the original suit.
</P>
<P>
   But if the government wins its broadened case, the court-ordered
remedies would no doubt be far tougher on Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   In May, the government's suggested steps amounted to equal
treatment for Netscape's browser and Microsoft's browser. But the
government recently asked that the judge hold a separate hearing on
remedies, if it wins the case. The remedies under consideration now
include more basic changes in Microsoft's business practices _
perhaps even a breakup of the company _ intended to loosen
Microsoft's grip on computing. That would be precisely the kind of
sweeping reform that Microsoft's foes would applaud.
</P>
<P>
   ``The government has doubled the bet and doubled the stakes,''
said David Yoffie, a professor at the Harvard business school who
is co-author of the book, ``Competing on Internet Time: Lessons
From Netscape and Its Battle With Microsoft.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, in the Microsoft camp, the government's strategy is
dismissed as a desperate act _ taken after a court ruling in June
that threatened to undermine the antitrust suit. That ruling came
in a separate case, involving the interpretation of the consent
decree that Microsoft signed with the Justice Department in 1995.
In the June ruling, a federal appeals court said that Microsoft
could bundle its browser with its industry-standard Windows
operating system and call them one product.
</P>
<P>
   The appeals-court ruling would seem to undercut the assertion in
the government's current antitrust case that the browser and the
operating system were two separate products, bundled together and
given away in an effort to thwart competition in the browser
market.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the appeals-court ruling in June, the government lost the
heart of its case,'' said Charles Rule, a former senior official in
the Justice Department, who is now a consultant to Microsoft. ``So
it has taken a blunderbuss approach of scrambling to throw
everything it can find _ even evidence the Justice Department has
had for years _ into the gun barrel and see what hits.''
</P>
<P>
   The June appellate ruling did shake the prosecution team. But
mostly it strengthened the hand of those within the Justice
Department who had been urging that the case be broadened,
according to people who have worked on the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, they say, new evidence was coming in as the
investigation moved ahead and prosecutors raced to meet the
accelerated trial schedule approved by the court. Speed was a
priority from the outset, they say. The Justice Department and the
states filed their suit in May to move before Microsoft's new
operating system, Windows 98, was introduced in June. While not
seeking to block the release of Windows 98, government lawyers
wanted to get to the the courtroom as early as possible as PC
makers and computer users adopt this latest version of Microsoft's
Windows operating system, which functions as the central nervous
system for more than 90 percent of personal computers sold.
</P>
<P>
   The key allegations, government lawyers note, have not changed
since May _ namely, that Microsoft illegally used its market power
in operating systems to defend its monopoly position and to try to
extend into new markets. ``But the only thing that was wrapped up
in a bow in time for the May filing was the browser,'' said one
person who worked on the case. ``The real game plan was always to
get a broader case.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   What is more, one person noted, the prosecution team was not at
full strength until shortly before the suit was filed. David Boies,
a renowned courtroom litigator and a former partner at Cravath,
Swaine &AMP; Moore who successfully defended IBM in its 13-year
confrontation with the government, was named as special counsel for
the Justice Department last December. But Boies, who left Cravath
last year, did not start working full-time for the Justice
Department until mid-April, because he was still finishing private
cases for his own firm, Boies &AMP; Schiller.
</P>
<P>
   The antitrust suit filed in May leaned heavily on the Netscape
story, mentioning Microsoft's main rival in the browser market some
130 times in the complaint and a supporting memorandum. But it also
prominently mentioned Microsoft's tactics against Sun Microsystems,
creator of Java, an Internet programming language, and cited it as
an ``example'' of Microsoft's behavior.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was crafted as a template that could be added to without
much stretching,'' one person involved in the case said.
</P>
<P>
   And so, as new evidence piled up and seemed to fit into a
pattern, Klein step by step approved the widening of the case, the
person said. And that explains, the person continued, how it is
that evidence that has been in the hands of the Justice Department
for years has been added to the case since May; only after
gathering new evidence did it become apparent that the older
material fit the pattern of the current case.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the government has added the contention that
Microsoft pressured Intel Corp., the big microchip maker and a
close partner of Microsoft, to curb its development efforts in
multimedia and Internet software because they might conflict with
Microsoft's plans. The government contends that the arm-twisting
occurred at meetings between the two companies three years ago,
especially one on Aug. 2, 1995, which was attended by Andrew Grove,
the Intel chairman, and Bill Gates, the Microsoft chairman.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the government's evidence in the Intel-Microsoft episode
is copies of the handwritten notes taken by Steven McGeady, an
Intel vice president who attended the meetings, and a memo written
by him on Aug. 28, 1995. The memo, still under court seal, said
that Gates ``made vague threats'' and was ``livid'' about Intel's
investments in the Internet ``and wanted them stopped.'' A
handwritten note, also under court seal, quotes Paul Maritz, a
Microsoft executive, as saying that Netscape is their ``common
enemy'' and that Intel's role should be to ``fill in stuff in and
around Microsoft's strategy.''
</P>
<P>
   These documents were sent by Intel to the Justice Department's
office in San Francisco in November 1995, in response to a Civil
Investigative Demand _ a civil subpoena _ served on Intel on Nov.
10, 1995.
</P>
<P>
   On its own, the Intel material was intriguing, but it became
part of the antitrust suit only as other evidence surfaced, one
person close to the case said. The government is contending that
Microsoft also tried to urge Apple to stop selling its Quicktime
multimedia software in the Windows market and tried to convince
Real Networks Inc. to pull back in the market for so-called
streaming software.
</P>
<P>
   The government case has also broadened, people involved in the
case say, as more witnesses from the industry have been
increasingly willing to testify.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the beginning, most people in the industry believed that
the government would lose and Microsoft would retaliate if they
came forward,'' one person said. ``But as the strength of our case
was perceived to improve, more people were willing to come forward,
and things snowballed. You get Intel, it's easier to get Apple and
so on.''

   Following is the text of the first two sections of the Sherman
Act, as passed by Congress in 1890. As the foundation on which
federal antitrust law has been built, the act has been amended
several times _ elevating the crime to a felony, increasing the
fines and prison terms for individuals and setting fines for
corporations convicted of violating it. In the case of Microsoft,
the government has invoked the Sherman Act to file a civil suit
that seeks to change the company's business practices, not a
criminal suit that seeks financial penalties.
</P>
<P>
   An Act to Protect Trade And Commerce Against Unlawful Restraints
and Monopolies:
</P>
<P>
   Section 1. Every contract, combination in the form of trust or
otherwise, or conspiracy, in restraint of trade or commerce among
the several States, or with foreign nations, is hereby declared to
be illegal. Every person who shall make any such contract or engage
in any such combination or conspiracy, shall be deemed guilty of a
misdemeanor, and, on conviction thereof, shall be punished by fine
not exceeding five thousand dollars, or by imprisonment not
exceeding one year, or by both said punishments, in the discretion
of the court.
</P>
<P>
   Section 2. Every person who shall monopolize, or attempt to
monopolize, or combine or conspire with any other person or
persons, to monopolize any part of the trade of commerce among the
several States, or with foreign nations, shall be deemed guilty of
a misdemeanor, and, on conviction thereof, shall be punished by
fine not exceeding five thousand dollars, or by imprisonment not
exceeding one year, or by both said punishments, in the discretion
of the court.

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROUSSILLON, France _ Our meeting was set for noon, but it was
after 1 and I was lost. I knew he lived in this little seaside
village, but I couldn't find him. So I called from a gas station.
``I'll come along to fetch you,'' he said. ``I'll be in a Deux
Chevaux. You can follow me back.''
</P>
<P>
   I was nervous. He was, I knew, 83 and by all reports quite
fragile. He was known to detest interviews, and most interviewers,
and he'd agreed only reluctantly to see me. Soon the ancient car
appeared, maneuvering adroitly around the tourists wandering in the
narrow street. He stopped, thrust out a hand by way of greeting,
smiled and said, ``Come along, then; it's not far.''
</P>
<P>
   And so I met Patrick O'Brian, the celebrated British-Irish
author of the Aubrey-Maturin novels about the British Navy during
the Napoleonic Wars, books that have been called both literary
tours de force and some of the best sea adventures ever written.
His latest, ``The Hundred Days,'' 19th in the series, was about to
be published, and I'd flown down from Paris to see him.
</P>
<P>
   O'Brian's town is on the Mediterranean near the Spanish border.
Once a quiet fishing village, it's now a tourist destination.
``Must you use the name?'' he asked. ``It seems like everyone who's
read the books wants to come. Thank God the townspeople protect me.
When someone asks for me, they shrug and shake their heads, or they
say: `He's not here. He's gone away.'''
</P>
<P>
   Patrick O'Brian was not what I'd been led to expect, which was a
testy old party who dwelt in the past, with a bookworm's pallor and
a disdain for the workaday modern world. He is shy but hardly
withdrawn. He is, after all, a storyteller. He is polite, almost
courtly, and his color, if not quite brown, befits a man who has
sailed all his life and lived half a century on the Mediterranean
littoral. His face is lined, but his eyes are bright and his gaze
piercing. He could be 20 years younger than he is.
</P>
<P>
   Alone at his desk, he may dwell in the 18th century, but
literary fame and no small amount of money have shown him that the
end of this century has its sweet moments, too. Particularly sweet
for a writer who had to wait until his 60s for fame to find him.
</P>
<P>
   By now, the outlines of O'Brian's literary career are fairly
well known. After more than 20 years of middling success as a
novelist, short story writer and translator, he was induced by his
publisher to write a novel about the British navy in the Napoleonic
Wars. ``Master and Commander'' appeared in 1969. It was the first
of his books to feature Jack Aubrey, a British naval officer, and
Stephen Maturin, an Irish-Catalan physician, naturalist and spy who
was Jack's friend and constant shipmate.
</P>
<P>
   Eighteen novels about the pair have followed, with the most
recent, ``The Hundred Days,'' published in September. The 20th is
already well under way. ``Master and Commander'' had a modest
success in England and Ireland, and a dozen more books in the
series were produced over the next decade.
</P>
<P>
   But it wasn't until 1989, when Starling Lawrence, now his
American editor, read one of the books, ``The Reverse of the
Medal'' (No. 11), on a flight from London to New York, and
Lawrence's company, W.W. Norton, began to publish the books in the
United States that they were taken up by serious critics. Within
two years, 400,000 had been sold in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   In all, more than 2 million copies of the Aubrey-Maturin novels
have been sold. O'Brian has been compared to Melville and Conrad,
even to Proust. Iris Murdoch, the English novelist and scholar, was
one of his first champions, and his fans include Eudora Welty and
Tom Stoppard.
</P>
<P>
   The Aubrey-Maturin series has been said to rival the sequential
novels of Trollope and Anthony Powell. O'Brian is particularly
pleased when he is compared to Jane Austen, whom he reveres as the
finest of all English novelists. First editions of most of her
novels share shelf space in his small library here with first
editions of Gibbon and Dr. Johnson and a battered but still useful
1810 edition of the Encyclopaedia Britannica. The second book of
the series, ``Post Captain,'' set mostly in country houses and as
much a novel of manners as a sea story, has been said to be
O'Brian's homage to Ms. Austen.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Patrick O'Brian was born in Galway in 1914 and grew up in
genteel but often straitened circumstances. A sickly child, he was
educated mostly at home, reading widely and deeply. Eventually he
mastered French, Italian, Spanish and Catalan. He knows some Irish
and reads easily in Latin.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to friends with boats, he was acquainted with the sea
from childhood. Like his creation, Stephen Maturin, he is a
passionate naturalist and even now tries to arrange his book tours
so as to spend time in museums or in the field, observing birds and
animals. An avid amateur astronomer, he spends hours with his
treasured telescope watching the night sky, much as Aubrey and his
officers do at sea in the novels.
</P>
<P>
   After World War II, in which he was an ambulance driver in
London and later served in a still unspecified branch of military
intelligence, O'Brian and his wife, Mary, moved to Wales. Wales is
beautiful; it can also be grim. ``Dear people, splendid mountains,
but a terrible climate,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   France beckoned. It would be easier, they decided, to be poor in
a warm climate, so in 1949, they came to Roussillon. ``It was an
anxious, hungry time,'' he recalled, ``yet we were upon the whole
extraordinarily happy.'' The sea was close at hand, the mountains
loomed over the village and just behind the house _ a cottage,
really _ was a vineyard.
</P>
<P>
   Tourism has changed the face of the Roussillon coast forever;
the streets are jammed with cars and tour buses, parking is
impossible and tacky new houses are defacing the land. But the
little O'Brian vineyard remains. Almost as proud of his wines as he
is of his prose, he offered me two glasses at lunch.
</P>
<P>
   ``This one is the wine of the year,'' he said, ``and this one is
five years old.'' Both were attractive red wines, and the
83-year-old wine-maker was obviously pleased to hear someone say
so. ``For years, I made the wine myself,'' O'Brian said. ``But last
year, I fell from a ladder reaching for a book on a high shelf. I
crushed two vertebrae, and now I have to have a young man help me
with the wine.''
</P>
<P>
   The one-bedroom O'Brian house, with its red-tile roof and inner
patio, is as Spanish as it is French, which is appropriate in a
Catalan town. Nearby Perpignan was the capital of Catalonia until
the 15th century. O'Brian writes until lunch time in a long, cool
room under the house that is more cave than basement. After lunch,
he returns to his writing table until tea time, 4:30. Only then
will he take telephone calls. If the writing is going well, he may
return to his manuscript.
</P>
<P>
   He writes in longhand, as did all his 18th-century literary
heroes, then has the manuscript typed for editing. In fact, little
editing is needed. Older manuscripts show whole pages with hardly a
phrase or a word crossed out. O'Brian lives alone. His wife, whom
he met in London during the war, was his editor and typist most of
her life. She died this year.
</P>
<P>
   With a smile, he waves away any further inquiries into his
private life. He does admit to ``several children and six
grandchildren'' of whom he is is immensely proud.
</P>
<P>
   Success has changed O'Brian's life considerably. In France, he
lives cut off from most things British and Irish, but his frequent
book trips have taken him abroad regularly. Besides his quaint Deux
Chevaux Citroen, he has a modern, powerful Renault, which takes him
to the Perpignan airport at Rivesaltes for the flight to Paris.
After a night at the Travelers Club on the Champs-Elysees, he takes
the Eurostar train to London, where he slips happily back into the
18th century at his club, Brooks'. There too he revels in the past.

   ``I remember having Charlton Heston to dinner there,'' he said,
``and telling him that the chafing dish we were served from was a
gift to the club from the Elder Pitt.'' A friend and admirer for
many years, Heston contributed an essay to a critical appreciation
and bibliography of O'Brian's work published in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   The success of the Aubrey-Maturin novels has made an authentic
cult figure of O'Brian. Fans besiege him on book tours and discuss
him and his fictional characters at length on the Internet. One
popular Web site is called the Gunroom, the name for the officer's
wardroom in a man-of-war of the time (the Patrick O'Brian page at
www.wwnorton.com).
</P>
<P>
   There is also an armamentarium of associated material, including
an atlas and geographical guide to the novels called ``Harbors and
High Seas,'' a lexicon and literary companion to the books called
``A Sea of Words,'' now in its second edition, and a cookbook,
``Lobscouse and Spotted Dog,'' based on what Jack Aubrey and Steven
Maturin and their shipmates ate ashore and at sea (including rats).
</P>
<P>
   Aubrey and Maturin are also amateur musicians, violinist and
cellist, respectively, and so two CD's of the music they play
aboard ship have been recorded by the Philharmonia Virtuosi.
</P>
<P>
   O'Brian's pre-Aubrey novel of the sea, ``The Golden Ocean,'' has
been reissued, as well as his 1976 biography of Picasso and two
volumes of short stories.
</P>
<P>
   Some critics have suggested that the more recent novels in the
Aubrey-Maturin series are not of the same quality as the earlier
ones. Indeed, the wars are over and, with ``The Hundred Days,''
Napoleon is vanquished forever. Because he never expected the
series to go on as long as it has, O'Brian has had to make
occasional creative adjustments to their chronology.
</P>
<P>
   But the second and third decades of the 19th century saw the
wars of liberation in Latin America, and impeccable sources in
Naval Intelligence indicate that Jack Aubrey, now Admiral Aubrey,
will be on the quarterdeck, his friend Dr. Maturin at his side, for
many voyages to come.

`AFRICANS IN AMERICA': HOW A `PECULIAR INSTITUTION' SHAPED A
NATION'S HISTORY 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: Production notes at the end of article. Time, channel for New
York area. Check local listings.)

<TEXT>
<P>
   If there is still any doubt about the central and profound place
in U.S. history of the black Africans who were carried here as
slaves, it should be laid to rest by ``Africans in America.''
Subtitled ``America's Journey Through Slavery,'' the forceful
four-part series that begins Monday on PBS combines recent
scholarship with famous slave narratives to explore the resounding
clash between the young nation's ideals of freedom and the
realities of bondage.
</P>
<P>
   The story begins with the birth of colonial America, the
settlement of Jamestown, Va., with its promise of a city on a hill,
in 1607. Soon the English settlers were joined by a cargo of
Africans, who had been purchased as servants. For a brief moment it
may have seemed that black and white workers would exist side by
side, but by the middle of the century, for tens of thousands of
Africans transported to the Americas, a racially segregated slave
society had become entrenched. ``The freedom of some,'' one of
Monday night's scholars observes, ``is going to depend on the
bondage of others.''
</P>
<P>
   Vividly treated here is the power of money in creating and
supporting the ``peculiar institution'' that took hold on tobacco
and cotton plantations and on the rice-growing Carolina coast,
bending American ideals to benefit a white hierarchy. For the
millions of people kidnapped from their homes on the west coast of
Africa, that meant the cruelties of the slave trade and attendant
miseries.
</P>
<P>
   It is a complex story: of race, class and religion; of the
principles of the Declaration of Independence in a clash with the
laws of property and the pursuit of profit; of the changing meaning
of democracy and liberty as development of what the narrator calls
``a new people in a new place.''
</P>
<P>
   This thoughtful, often moving documentary chronicles the
experiences of fugitive slaves that turned much of the nation
against slavery; the abiding courage of the abolitionists; the
battles between slaveholders and Free-Soil forces in ``bleeding
Kansas''; the Dred Scott decision and John Brown's quixotic
insurrection at Harpers Ferry; and the Civil War and Emancipation,
which settled much but left so much unsettled.
</P>
<P>
   Scholars continue to differ on matters like the profitability of
slave labor (by 1830, we learn on Monday evening, slaves were worth
more than $1 billion to their owners), on interracial feelings
North and South, on the impact of slave revolts and other issues.
</P>
<P>
   But history has settled the disputes over the inherent
viciousness of a system bred in violence and sustained by force. As
for the fateful divisions planted in the original colonies that
left America with so tangled and troubling a legacy, they continue
to resonate through ``Africans in America.''

<P>
   LONDON _ Looking for the latest anti-apartheid protest or Jethro
Tull gig? Thirty years ago _ before history claimed such events as
its grist _ the place to look was Time Out, then a start-up
listings magazine produced by a 21-year-old British college
graduate.
</P>
<P>
   Last weekend, as Time Out celebrated its 30th birthday with a
noisy bash for 3,000 people at south London's Brixton Academy, the
same publication _ now with earnings of some $34 million a year _
could tell you about a whole lot more than gigs and demos. Where to
find sex in New York, for instance, was on the cover of its
3-year-old New York edition; and, symbolically enough, the
anniversary issue in London featured a long interview with the
British rock star Ian Dury, who, despite a personal battle with
cancer, has metamorphosed into a plumper, slicker version of
himself, albeit with a lingering irreverence _ rather like Time
Out.
</P>
<P>
   For a publication that likes to promote itself as being at the
cutting edge, though, Time Out has been slow to commit
wholeheartedly to the Internet. A plan to expand its World Wide Web
site this month to include the entire output of the magazine was
postponed. Instead, a radically re-designed Web site
(www.timeout.com) is supposed to provide an international look at
events in 25 cities.
</P>
<P>
   Tony Elliott, owner and founder of Time Out Group, said he had
considered putting the magazine on the Internet to mark the 30th
anniversary, but shelved the idea because of the $1.6 million cost.
Not only that, the very accessibility of the Internet raises a big
question in his mind not just about the nature of a delivery system
but also about how information is valued.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've known since the 1970s that Time Out's future is
electronic but I don't like the idea of it being for free,'' he
said. ``We sell a major package which people are prepared to spend
cash for and I think the idea of making it free, willy-nilly,
overnight, would be irresponsible. And I think the Europeans will
show the Americans that people will pay for content.''
</P>
<P>
   Such considerations show how far the magazine has come from its
birth in a London basement as a fold-out sheet that sold for what
would now be five pence _the equivalent of eight cents.
</P>
<P>
   The magazine's name now adorns not just editions in London and
New York, but also franchises in Rome and Paris, along with an
array of eating, drinking and shopping guides. In conjunction with
Penguin Books, the magazine publishes guides to 20 cities from
Amsterdam to Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   In this age of constant expansion and brand extension, one
question about the publication is where it goes next. One part of
the answer is: further into the United States. Of the 3,000 people
at the Oct. 9 party in Brixton, 79 had been flown in from New York
_ virtually the entire New York staff, which prides itself on
having pushed circulation to more than 85,000 (compared with the
parent magazine's 98,839 in London) following a 31 percent jump in
the first six months of this year.
</P>
<P>
   The performance in New York has encouraged Elliott, 51, to toy
with another U.S. edition _ either in Los Angeles or San Francisco,
Chicago or Washington _ even though the New York start-up cost more
than expected.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a huge expectation that Time Out will go to Los
Angeles,'' Elliott said, but added that no decision will be made
until he is ``sure that New York is paying its way,'' a
breakthrough he forecasts for next year. That will doubtless
hearten Elliott's backers in the New York project _ The Clark
Estates and William Louis Dreyfus _ who, along with Elliott, put up
something between $10 and $30 million (Elliott refused to be more
precise) to start Time Out New York in September 1995, in an
uncertain market.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone said there was no hope for us,'' said Cyndi Stivers,
editor of the New York edition.'' But, she continued, ``one of the
reasons we succeeded in New York was that we really did it on a
shoestring.''
</P>
<P>
   The austerity, she said, led to ambitious staff members moving
to better-paying jobs.
</P>
<P>
   While the New York edition has grown, though, the circulation of
the London version has shrunk by some 11 percent during the same
period, reflecting inroads by listings magazines distributed free
in several British newspapers. Even so, advertising revenue has
risen by a fifth over the same period to the equivalent of around
$14.7 million, or roughly two-thirds of the London magazine's
revenues.
</P>
<P>
   Elliott says he has turned down inquiries from would-be buyers
for the magazine. ``I have no interest in selling,'' he said. ``I'm
not particularly motivated by having tons of cash in the bank. I
would rather really, really, really enjoy what I'm doing and have a
good living from it.''

PINOCHET'S ARREST PUTS BLAIR'S GOVERNMENT IN A TIGHT SPOT 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also PINOCHET-CHILE, PINOCHET-LAW, PINOCHET-JUDGE.) 
(nk) 
 By ALAN COWELL

<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Gen. Augusto Pinochet, the former Chilean dictator
arrested here at the request of a Spanish judge, remained
sequestered under police guard Sunday, awaiting a potentially
devastating court hearing to weigh his extradition on charges of
genocide, terrorism and murder.
</P>
<P>
   British officials have not said where Pinochet is, but scores of
Chilean emigres gathered Sunday outside the upscale London Clinic
where the 82-year-old general underwent back surgery Oct. 9. The
demonstrators jubilantly demanded Pinochet's extradition to Spain
and held up photographs of some of the ``disappeared'' among the
3,000 people shot or abducted during his 17-year dictatorship, from
1973 to 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Pinochet's detention late Friday has left Prime Minister Tony
Blair's Labor government seemingly embarrassed by the diplomatic
implications of an arrest that has enraged the government of Chile
_ which Britain regards as an ally _ and confronted European
officials with uncomfortable implications for their handling of
human rights violators from closer to home.
</P>
<P>
   ``What goes for Gen. Pinochet also goes for all the Mladics and
Karadzics who are still in hiding and will be, one day or another,
arrested and judged for their crimes,'' said Jacques Poos, the
Foreign Minister of Luxembourg, referring to the Radovan Karadzic
and Ratko Mladic, Bosnian Serb leaders indicted on war crimes
charges by the United Nations War Crime Tribunal in The Hague. Both
have consistently eluded arrest.
</P>
<P>
   Britain, however, seemed uncomfortable about turning the
general's detention into any new crusade. Neither Blair nor Foreign
Secretary Robin Cook made public statements about the arrest,
sheltering behind official statements that it was purely a
``judicial matter.''
</P>
<P>
   The arrest has reopened a traditional divide between Labor and
the opposition Tories who, while in office until 1997, regularly
allowed Pinochet to enter Britain without fanfare either for
medical treatment or to pursue arms deals with British defense
contractors.
</P>
<P>
   Blair's government had been under strong pressure from Labor
supporters and human rights groups to display its public commitment
to ethical foreign policies by acting against Pinochet.
</P>
<P>
   Word of his presence here produced an outcry in newspapers
generally supportive of Labor and among Labor legislators. Indeed,
Trade Minister Peter Mandelson termed Pinochet a ``brutal
dictator'' in a television interview Sunday and said his claim of
diplomatic immunity against arrest ``for most people in this
country would be pretty gut-wrenching stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   But Michael Howard, a former Tory Interior Minister who took no
action during Pinochet's earlier visits, said the arrest reflected
the behavior of ``a very arrogant government'' that may be
``displaying its utter contempt for our legal system and for the
rule of law'' to appease a political constituency.
</P>
<P>
   Pinochet was placed under arrest after a senior Spanish judge,
Baltasar Garzon, sent a request to detain him in connection with
possible extradition hearings. The warrant on which he was arrested
alleges that Pinochet ``did murder Spanish citizens in Chile within
the jurisdiction of the government of Spain,'' and was guilty of
``crimes of genocide and terrorism that includes murder.''
</P>
<P>
   Garzon and a Spanish colleague, Judge Manuel Garcia Castellon,
are expected to travel to London to question him, possibly in the
next few days.
</P>
<P>
   Chile has protested the arrest, insisting that, as a senator for
life, Pinochet enjoyed diplomatic immunity under his diplomatic
passport. But, said Alun Michael, a senior official in the Home
Office, ``a diplomatic passport does not, of course, guarantee
diplomatic immunity.''
</P>
<P>
   British officials deny that the detention was politically
inspired. Michael said Sunday that ``there has been no intervention
which has been inappropriate at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Under British law, the authorities must decide within 40 days
whether to proceed with extradition. The first step is a
magistrates' court hearing where Pinochet's accusers set out their
reasons for extradition. No date for this hearing has been set.
Then, Jack Straw, the Home Secretary, must decide whether to order
the extradition.

INDIA AND PAKISTAN AGREE TO KEEP TALKING ON NUCLEAR WEAPONS
</HEADLINE>
   (jw) 
 By CELIA W. DUGGER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan _ On the third and final day of talks
between Indian and Pakistani diplomats, the world's two newest
nuclear powers announced Sunday that they had agreed only to keep
talking to each other about ways to reduce the risk of nuclear
conflict between them.
</P>
<P>
   The foreign secretaries of the rival nations presented proposals
designed to help dispel the mistrust and enmity that have
characterized their relationship since British India was divided
into Pakistan and India 51 years ago. But no agreement was reached
on even on the most modest of them.
</P>
<P>
   The two sides said they would meet again in New Delhi in
February to continue the conversation and claimed a small victory
from the simple fact that they have been sitting down in the same
room to discuss their differences.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since India, and then Pakistan, exploded nuclear devices in
May, the other nuclear powers have been putting pressure on them to
restart talks that stalled a year ago. Pakistanis themselves have
repeatedly said Kashmir, a predominantly Muslim territory in the
Himalayas that both countries claim, could become a nuclear flash
point.
</P>
<P>
   Pakistan controls a sliver of Kashmir and India most of the
rest, and the countries regularly exchange fire across the line
that divides the parts of Kashmir that each controls. India and
Pakistan have fought three wars, two of them over Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
   The diplomats did discuss Kashmir in this round of talks, but
apparently did little more than rehash old ground, or as the joint
statement they issued Sunday said, ``The two sides reiterated their
respective positions.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It would have been unrealistic on anybody's part to expect we
would come along after this short session with progress on an issue
that is one of the most complex this world faces today,'' Pakistani
Foreign Secretary Shamshad Ahmed said after Saturday's session.
</P>
<P>
   While the sober-faced foreign secretaries couched their remarks
in a kind of platitudinous code, they managed to describe very
different ways of approaching the negotiations. Indian Foreign
Secretary Krishnan Raghunath said the two countries should try to
start small, with modest steps to which both could agree without
major concessions. But Ahmed said it would be difficult to make
progress until the Kashmir question is addressed.
</P>
<P>
   He said Kashmir ``is the core problem between our two countries
and the root cause of tensions in the region.''
</P>
<P>
   India, which has already committed itself to a policy of no
first use of nuclear weapons, asked Pakistan to adopt the same
doctrine, an Indian official said, speaking on the condition of
anonymity. But Pakistan refused on grounds that it needs the
nuclear threat to counter India's superior conventional military
forces.
</P>
<P>
   Pakistan in turn proposed that the two nations sign a
nonaggression pact, with a provision to set up a process for the
resolution of disputes, with third-party mediation in cases
Pakistan and India could not resolve on their own. But India, which
has ruled out international mediation on Kashmir, rejected the
Pakistani proposal.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Both countries proposed a number of more modest measures to
reduce their mutual hostility. The written proposals from each
country were not made public, but were provided to The New York
Times by an Indian official.
</P>
<P>
   India advocated that the two countries give each other prior
notice of flight testing of ballistic missiles; that they agree not
to aim weapons at each other's population or economic centers; that
they exchange visits by senior military officers, and that they
upgrade the hot lines between their prime ministers, military
commanders and foreign secretaries.
</P>
<P>
   An Indian official said the two countries now have an
out-of-date hot line that is neither fail-safe nor secure. ``If the
telephone line is down, it is down,'' he said. The military
operations directors should have not just a telephone link, but
also special fax and computer lines, the Indians said.
</P>
<P>
   The Pakistani proposals were less specific than those of the
Indians. Their page-and-a-half-long list of one-line suggestions
included measures to prevent violations of air space, prior
notification of military exercises, upgrading of the communication
links between military commanders and restraints on hostile
propaganda.
</P>
<P>
   But the big issues apparently got in the way of small
agreements, despite the similarities between some of the Pakistani
and Indian proposals.
</P>
<P>
   As Ahmed bade good-bye to the reporters assembled for the news
conference in Punjab House here, he told them he hoped that they
would return for additional rounds of talks in coming months and
years _ a measure of the distance the two countries have yet to
travel before they settle their intractable differences.

`HEARTS GROWN BRUTAL': ROOTS OF BOSNIAN HORROR LIE NOT SO DEEP
</HEADLINE>
   (EDS: Publication notes at end of review.) 
(nk) 
Noel Malcolm is the author of ``Bosnia: A Short History'' and
``Kosovo: A Short History.'' By NOEL MALCOLM    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   On June 5, 1995, Roger Cohen was sitting in his room in the
Holiday Inn, Sarajevo, when a sudden surge of electricity enabled
him to switch on the television and watch Al Gore telling Larry
King about Bosnian history. ``This is a tragedy that has been
unfolding for some time,'' observed the vice president. ``Some
would say for 500 years.''
</P>
<P>
   Only 500? If developments in the political and military history
of the 1990s can be traced so confidently all the way back to the
15th century, why stop there? President Clinton showed an obliging
willingness to go the extra mile. ``It's tragic, it's terrible,''
he empathized. ``But their enmities go back 500 years, some would
say almost a thousand years.''
</P>
<P>
   So there you have it: The origins of the Bosnian war can be
found somewhere in the late 10th century, between, let us say, the
death of Alfred the Great and the birth of Omar Khayyam. This
theory, attributing the conflict to ancient ethnic hatreds, has
become a matter of almost religious faith in the minds of many
Western politicians and diplomats.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen, who reported from Bosnia for The New York Times
throughout the war, is too good a journalist to be satisfied for
one moment with this sort of pseudo-historical flimflam. Having
interviewed the local politicians and having met innumerable
ordinary Bosnians, he can see that the conflict was essentially a
product of modern political history, and he knows that for most
people lethal hatred was the consequence of the war, not its cause.
This is perhaps the most important lesson that readers will learn
from ``Hearts Grown Brutal,'' his powerfully written, ambitious and
many-layered study of the Bosnian war.
</P>
<P>
   Like any journalist worth his salt, Cohen knows, too, that when
Western politicians utter vague historical platitudes, they are not
necessarily explaining the real reasons for their policies. The
doctrine of ``ancient ethnic hatreds'' was convenient for Western
leaders; it lent an air of justifiability to a policy approach _ of
hesitancy, inaction and denial _ that had already been adopted for
other reasons.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen is also too decent a human being to remain entirely
dispassionate when considering the moral failure of the West's
Bosnian policy. The last third of this book consists of a scathing
catalog of Western cowardice and hypocrisy: from the early
reluctance to accept (still less to look for) evidence of
concentration camps and massacres, to the final tragedy of the
so-called ``safe area'' of Srebrenica.
</P>
<P>
   Much of this has been said before, of course. But at several key
points, Cohen has important information to add.
</P>
<P>
   He sheds new light, for example, on the role played during the
hostage crisis of June 1995 by French President Jacques Chirac, who
pushed hard (and successfully) for a policy of appeasement. And he
quotes from the secret minutes of a crucial meeting between United
Nations civilian and military authorities on the ninth of that
month, at which fatal misjudgments about the Serbs' plans for
Srebrenica became fixed in official U.N. policy. These sections of
the book alone would suffice to make it required reading for all
future historians of the Bosnian war.
</P>
<P>
   But what Cohen has set out to provide in this book is much more
than just a catalog of Western blunders. He is also trying to
explain the meaning of the war at two different levels: in terms of
human experience and longer-term Yugoslav history. The first of
these tasks is accomplished by weaving into the narrative the
stories of several ordinary Bosnian families.
</P>
<P>
   What comes across most strongly from these personal histories is
the sense of bewilderment most people felt. The outbreak of war
took them by surprise, and the transformation of neighbors into
enemies seemed to have no basis in their previous experience. Their
favorite metaphor was that a whirlwind had come out of nowhere and
blown their lives apart.
</P>
<P>
   Where and why had that whirlwind been generated? Because it is
hard to imagine how hatreds can be created out of nothing at all,
Cohen naturally hunts around for pre-existing tensions and
animosities.
</P>
<P>
   These he finds not in ``ancient ethnic hatreds,'' but in
unresolved, or unrecognized, conflicts of 20th-century Yugoslav
history. He tells the story of the massacres of Serbs by extremist
``Ustasha'' Croats in World War II, of Muslim collaboration with
the Nazis and of atrocities committed by Serb Chetniks. Because
this murky history was never properly confronted or acknowledged
during the Communist period, he suggests, such hatreds could only
intensify and fester.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen's argument here is a little misleading on some points. It
can hardly be claimed that the Communists swept the history of
Jasenovac (the notorious Ustasha-run death camp) under the carpet,
when they built a sky-high monument at the camp and bused in
schoolchildren to visit it. And the way in which Cohen has
presented his material, devoting the first 100 pages of the book to
the family story of a Muslim who served with the Nazi SS in the
war, may give a skewed impression. Only 18,000 Muslims joined the
SS, out of a population of nearly one million; most Muslims took no
part in the war, though many did join the anti-Nazi Partisans
during its final phase.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes Cohen comes close to suggesting that this 20th-century
history caused the Bosnian war, by creating psychological pressures
that found their natural release in violence. This argument would
seem not so very different from the ``ancient ethnic hatreds''
thesis, merely substituting modern political ones.
</P>
<P>
   More often, however, Cohen presents the causal mechanism the
other way around: low-level prejudices were transformed into
red-hot hatreds quite deliberately (and, I would add, wounds of war
that had genuinely healed were violently reopened), for modern
political purposes. If Cohen had known Bosnia long before the war,
he would be even more certain of the truth of this explanation.
</P>
<P>
   As it is, the bewilderment of those ordinary Bosnians, caught up
in Slobodan Milosevic's (and, later, Franjo Tudjman's) whirlwind,
must stand as sufficient testimony to the tragic noninevitability
of the Bosnian war. Readers of ``Hearts Grown Brutal'' may also be
bewildered by the sheer intensity of the violence it describes; but
at the same time they will be informed, challenged and moved by
this powerful and richly human book.

 ANALYSIS: BUDGET-SURPLUS SQUABBLING WILL GET NOISIER 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By RICHARD W. STEVENSON    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Faced with the first federal budget surplus in a
generation, the Clinton administration and the
Republican-controlled Congress squabbled throughout this year's
tax-and-spending negotiations. In the end, they spent more than
they had agreed to a year earlier but deferred until next year any
of the big decisions about how to take advantage of the nation's
newfound fiscal health.
</P>
<P>
   The debate over the surplus is likely to become only more
intense and more complex in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   In the next year, Congress and the White House intend to take up
substantial overhauls of the two biggest and most politically
sensitive entitlement programs, Social Security and Medicare, both
of which might need to draw on the surplus to solve their long-term
financial problems.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans, increasingly frustrated at their inability to enact
a conservative agenda, have vowed not to let President Clinton
block their tax-cutting plans again, even if it means defying his
insistence that the surplus be left untouched until Social
Security's solvency is assured.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Pentagon is lobbying the administration and
Congress for substantially more money after years of cutbacks.
</P>
<P>
   For their part, Democrats in Congress have a long list of
pent-up spending demands, and with Clinton needing support from the
party's liberal wing as he faces impeachment proceedings, they may
get at least tacit support from the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind that the economic outlook is suddenly murky, and that
any downturn would create considerable pressure to stimulate growth
through tax cuts and spending increases. Added to that is the fact
that a severe recession could call into question the assumption
that the government will enjoy surpluses for years to come.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first thing we learned this year is the difficulty
politicians have keeping their hands off of surpluses,'' said
Robert Bixby, the policy director for the Concord Coalition, a
fiscal watchdog group.
</P>
<P>
   ``The temptation is certainly there to spend more money, and the
temptation to go for more tax cuts is great,'' Bixby said. ``Fiscal
discipline only held because there was so much disagreement over
how to divide up the spoils that they gridlocked.''
</P>
<P>
   In purely economic terms, that gridlock is not a bad thing, at
least to many economists, including Alan Greenspan, the Federal
Reserve chairman. In not passing a big tax cut for the fiscal year
that started Oct. 1 or dramatically increasing spending, Congress
and the administration agreed by default to let the federal
government run a surplus for a second year in a row. This fiscal
year's surplus is projected to be on the order of $70 billion, or
roughly the same as the surplus in the year just completed.
</P>
<P>
   Running a surplus effectively means that the Treasury is able to
pay down some of the $5.5 trillion national debt. Reducing the
government's borrowing needs frees up more money in the economy for
investment by the private sector, helping to create jobs and
improve productivity.
</P>
<P>
   Reducing the national debt, however, is not seen by either party
as an accomplishment with much political appeal. So Republicans are
pressing ever-harder to use a big chunk of the surplus for tax
cuts, arguing that putting the money back in the hands of the
people is the best way to prevent Washington from spending it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will be back in January with more Republicans,'' Speaker
Newt Gingrich said on Thursday as the budget negotiations drew to a
close and members of both parties prepared to head home to
campaign. ``Then we can have a tax cut.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats say they have no intention of squandering their new
claims to fiscal responsibility. But there will be considerable
pressure from Democrats to use part of the surplus to help deal
with the problems in Medicare and Social Security. And largely at
Clinton's behest, the budget deal worked out last week called for
about $20 billion more in spending than envisioned in the 1997
bipartisan balanced budget agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Although that money was labeled ``emergency'' spending and is
supposed to be for one-time payments to help hard-hit farmers,
improve security at U.S. embassies around the world and help
prepare for the year 2000 computer problem, among other uses, it is
still likely to create increased pressure to renegotiate the tight
spending caps under which congressional appropriators are
operating. Neither party likes to be seen as cutting funding for
popular programs, emergency or not, and the caps for next year
could leave both parties chafing.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be tremendous pressure to reopen the budget
agreement as far as how much money is permitted under the
discretionary spending caps,'' said Richard May, a former
Republican chief of staff for the House Budget Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's demand that the surplus be set aside until he agrees
with Congress on a plan to shore up Social Security for the
retirement of the baby boom generation proved to be perhaps the
year's most successful political maneuver, uniting Democrats and
leaving Republicans fuming at their inability to cut taxes.
</P>
<P>
   But there is no consensus about how to use the surplus to help
Social Security; indeed, the administration has always been vague
about what Clinton has in mind. And the surplus will be only one
element in reshaping Social Security, with considerable attention
being focused on whether the system should permit individuals to
invest a portion of their payroll taxes in the financial markets, a
debate that has sharpened since the global economic crisis has sent
Wall Street reeling.
</P>
<P>
   Dealing with Medicare, long a flashpoint in partisan politics,
could prove equally contentious. ''Anyone who thinks a Medicare or
Social Security solution is going to be easy,'' said Rep. John
Spratt Jr. of South Carolina, the senior Democrat on the Budget
Committee, ``is mistaken.''

PUSH TO BUY PALM SHOWS MICROSOFT'S AGGRESSION IS CONSISTENT

<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ In a recent move that indicated he has no
intention of backing away from his company's aggressive business
tactics, Microsoft Corp.'s chairman, Bill Gates, has proposed
acquiring the software business behind 3Com Corp.'s popular Palm
Pilot hand-held computer, according to people who have been briefed
on the discussions.
</P>
<P>
   The offer, made in an August meeting with 3Com's chairman, Eric
Benhamou, was not accepted by 3Com executives, those people say.
</P>
<P>
   But certainly, Gates is said to have dangled an alluring
kingmaker's deal: If 3Com were willing to sell off its software
business, a market favorite compared with Microsoft's Windows CE
operating system, Gates would make the company's remaining Palm
Computing hardware business, ``the Compaq Computer of the hand-held
market.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials of both companies declined to confirm or deny word of
the meeting at Microsoft's Redmond, Wash., headquarters, at which
the two executives discussed a variety of strategic possibilities
between the two companies, according to several people privy to the
discussions.
</P>
<P>
   Though the proposal was unsuccessful, the approach provides
graphic insight into Microsoft's business tactics. As in its
abortive 1995 deal to acquire the financial software maker Intuit,
which was rejected not by Intuit but by the Justice Department,
Microsoft is increasingly looking to buy its way into markets where
its own products are not competitive enough to unseat established
brands.
</P>
<P>
   And the Palm Pilot offer would appear to indicate that Microsoft
has not scaled back its ambitions in the face of the Justice
Department's antitrust suit. The antitrust suit, initiated last
October, originally focused on Microsoft's linking of its Internet
Explorer World Wide Web browser with the industry-dominant Windows
95 operating system. But more recently, the Justice Department has
begun to examine a wide range of the company's business practices.
</P>
<P>
   Negotiations to control development and production of the
software that powers the most popular hand-held computer, the Palm
Pilot, are significant, analysts said, because hand-held devices,
from note-taking aids to cellular telephones, are one part of the
market where Microsoft does not appear to be quickly gaining
ground. The market is seen as growing more quickly than the
computer industry over all.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe Bill Gates was trying to get rid of a competitor,'' said
Andrew Seybold, a computer and communications analyst and publisher
of his own newsletter, based in Boulder Creek, Calif. ``I don't
think the Windows CE products have slowed them down at all.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   While Microsoft officials did not directly dispute word of the
overture to 3Com, they rebutted suggestions that they had lost
confidence in the Windows CE software.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any statement suggesting that Microsoft would license or buy
the Palm software in lieu of Windows CE is flatly false,'' said
Greg Shaw, a Microsoft spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   ``3Com is a great partner and we have frequent discussions with
them,'' he added. ``But it would be inappropriate to comment on
those discussions.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for 3Com simply said the company would not comment
on any of the discussions the company had held with Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   Though the two companies have had a broad set of partnerships in
other areas of computing, they have been bitter enemies in the
market for hand-held computers.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, 3Com filed suit in Germany after Microsoft
introduced a clone of the Palm Pilot, which it called the Palm PC.
Microsoft backed down, renaming its hand-held unit the Palm-sized
PC.
</P>
<P>
   The Palm Computing business of 3Com has shipped more than 1.5
million copies of its hand-held device, making it the dominant
player in the market for so-called personal digital assistants
after earlier efforts like Apple Computer Inc.'s Newton failed to
gain broad acceptance.
</P>
<P>
   By comparison, only about 750,000 Windows CE-based hand-held
systems have been shipped, according to Rob Enderle, an analyst at
Giga Information Group in Santa Clara, Calif.

HAMPTONS FESTIVAL FOCUSES ON COMEDY
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.Y., Calif., Pa.)   (jw) 
 By TERRY PRISTIN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   EAST HAMPTON, N.Y. _ Since its beginning, the Hamptons
International Film Festival here has been searching for an
identity, and perhaps it has found one.
</P>
<P>
   Begun in 1993 as a memorial to Time Warner Chairman Steven Ross,
the five-day event sought to become an incubator for innovative new
work. But coming on the heels of major festivals in Venice, Toronto
and New York, the Hamptons festival was not viewed as a major
player, and its programming choices were often seen as too
esoteric.
</P>
<P>
   The organizers ``tried to support very adventurous films that
were not going to find distribution,'' said David Schwartz,
director of programming and the fifth person to fill that role in
the festival's six years. ``There was a seriousness about it that
didn't create the most festive atmosphere.''
</P>
<P>
   This time, as they prepared for the festival, which ended Sunday
night, the organizers decided to lighten up. They did not worry so
much about whether a film had been seen at another festival. And in
contrast to many recent festivals at which dark films have
predominated, they chose comedy as one of their themes. The event
opened with ``Living Out Loud,'' a romance between the jilted wife
of a Fifth Avenue doctor (Holly Hunter) and an elevator operator
(Danny DeVito).
</P>
<P>
   ``If you go to a film festival in the Hamptons, you should have
some fun,'' said Schwartz, the chief curator of film and video at
the American Museum of the Moving Image in Astoria, Queens.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, some of the festival's biggest crowd-pleasers were
comedies. One of them, ``With Friends Like These,'' is about a
group of Italian-American character actors who are weary of playing
thugs and hit men and yearn to be the next Robert De Niro or Al
Pacino. The movie, which has toured the festival circuit but has
yet to find a distributor, has an ensemble cast, including Adam
Arkin, Robert Costanza and David Strathairn. The actors ``worked
for next to nothing'' on the film, which cost less than $5 million
to make, said director Philip Messina.
</P>
<P>
   Blake Edwards, a director and writer of dozens of comedies, who
has a home in Sagaponack, N.Y., was presented with a Lifetime
Achievement Award by Lauren Bacall at a ceremony on Saturday in the
Guild Theater here. Edwards, 76, delivered some funny lines
himself.
</P>
<P>
   Working with Peter Sellers on half a dozen movies, including the
``Pink Panther'' series, could be exasperating, he said, because
the actor often called him late at night to say he had just
received instructions from God on how to play a scene. Once,
Edwards said, Sellers fled in a huff for several days after the
director told him, ``Do me a favor: tell God to stay out of show
business.''
</P>
<P>
   Sellers starred in ``The Party,'' a 1968 film directed by
Edwards that was screened as part of an archival series that
included several classic comedies, among them Billy Wilder's ``Some
Like It Hot,'' Charlie Chaplin's ``City Lights'' and Richard
Lester's ``Help!'' as well as the 1981 independent film ``My Dinner
With Andre.'' That film's stars, Andre Gregory and Wallace Shawn,
engaged in another conversation after the screening before going
off to yet another dinner.
</P>
<P>
   At his tribute, Edwards, whose 1981 film ``S.O.B.'' savaged
Hollywood, drew laughter and applause when he boasted, ``I'm the
only director who has actually challenged three studio heads to
step outside.''
</P>
<P>
   Studio executives were also vilified in a panel discussion
earlier in the day, when Lester and another veteran comedy
director, Alex Cox, traded pointers and observations with three
younger filmmakers. Cox recalled that studio executives did not
know what to make of his 1984 ``Repo Man'' and caused tremendous
anxiety by talking on the telephone and paying little attention
when the film was shown to them. It went on to become a cult
favorite.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would like to say that since then, it's just been a bed of
roses,'' Cox said. ``But in fact it's all always the same.'' Seeing
five people walk out of a screening ``is like a dagger in your
heart,'' he said. Cox's latest film, ``Three Businessmen,'' had its
premiere at the festival before what Schwartz described as an
appreciative audience.
</P>
<P>
   The winner of the festival's Golden Starfish Award for best
independent film by an emerging American filmmaker was ``Edge
City,'' Eugene Martin's ``hip-hop opera'' about Philadelphia
teen-agers. The documentary award went to Ruth Leitman's ``Alma,''
the story of a Southern woman's struggle with her mentally ill
mother and abusive father.
</P>
<P>
   Although no overall attendance figure was available, about
20,000 tickets were sold to the 50 movies screened this year, and
more film industry representatives showed up than in 1997, said
Denise Kasell, executive director.
</P>
<P>
   As a sign that the festival may finally be finding its groove,
she said she and Schwartz had signed contracts to run the event
next year. &QL;

CONGRESS EXTENDS PROTECTION FOR GOOFY AND GERSHWIN
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By SABRA CHARTRAND    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Congress moved to rewrite American copyright law earlier this
month when it passed two hotly contested pieces of legislation. The
first lengthens protections by 20 years for an array of 20th
century cultural icons, including Mickey Mouse. The second
guarantees online providers of artistic material that their
responsibility for copyright infringement will be limited as the
digital age progresses.
</P>
<P>
   On Oct. 7, a year and a half after the Copyright Term Extension
Act was first introduced and after intense lobbying for it from
powerful copyright holders like the Walt Disney Co. and Time Warner
Inc., Congress passed the bill and extended the life of copyright
protection for the creators of original works. Since 1976,
copyrights have been good for the life of an artist plus 50 years.
</P>
<P>
   The new legislation lengthens copyrights for works created on or
after Jan. 1, 1978, to the life of the author plus 70 years and
extends copyrights for works created for hire and owned by
corporations to 95 years, from the current 75.
</P>
<P>
   With its vote, Congress prevented Disney's copyrights for
several of its most lucrative cartoon characters from becoming
public property in the next few years. Mickey Mouse, first
copyrighted in 1928, had been set to pass into the public domain in
2004; Pluto, Goofy and Donald Duck would have followed in 2009.
</P>
<P>
   Several days after the copyright extension legislation passed,
the House and Senate approved the On-Line Copyright Infringement
Liability Limitation Act. That legislation protects Internet
service providers from liability for unwittingly transmitting
material that infringes a copyright.
</P>
<P>
   Both bills generated plenty of controversy during the last year.
Opponents argued that they were unconstitutional, stifled
creativity and research or threatened privacy and competition. But
the proposals had powerful support from large corporations,
artists' interest groups and the Patent and Trademark Office.
</P>
<P>
   Both bills fit neatly into the patent agency's efforts over the
last several years to modify American intellectual property laws so
that they ``harmonize'' with those in Europe and Japan. In 1995,
controversy raged around a bill that altered the life span of a
American patent from 17 years from the date of issuance to 20 years
from the date of application _ making U.S. law identical to
patent-term laws in Europe and Japan. It passed.
</P>
<P>
   The philosophical basis for copyright protection is twofold: to
protect the rights of artists to profit from and control the use of
their work and to preserve public interest by guaranteeing that
eventually the right to use the works will pass into the public
domain.
</P>
<P>
   Arguments over which of those purposes takes precedence have
flared off and on since the first copyright law was passed in 1790.
It bestowed protection on artists for 14 years from publication,
with an option for a further 14-year renewal. That legislation
lasted until 1831, when the initial term was extended to 28 years
with a 14-year renewal. In 1909, the renewal term was stretched to
28 years. Then, in 1976, the renewal period was extended again to
47 years and copyright protection for the life of the author, plus
50 years, was given to anything published after 1976.
</P>
<P>
   That law seemed to satisfy artists and corporate copyright
holders until the expiration date of many valuable copyrights drew
near. An impressive list of mid-century works of art were set to
lose their copyrights over the next few years, including the songs
of George and Ira Gershwin as well as the Disney cartoon
characters. This would have happened just as the potential for new
uses of characters, songs and images is expanding with new markets
on digital television, cable services and the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   In Europe, artists and their heirs already had two extra decades
to control and profit from copyrighted works. So in the United
States, heirs like the Gershwin Family Trust, large corporations
like Disney and Time Warner, and organizations like the Motion
Picture Association of America and the American Society of
Composers, Authors and Publishers began lobbying for a change in
federal law.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents argued that copyright holders were trying to change
the rules of the game they had originally accepted and said that
creative and cultural expression would be stifled if the public was
not allowed free and fair access to works of art.
</P>
<P>
   Copyright holders and their heirs, in turn, insisted that
artistic work is property, just like real estate, paintings or
jewelry, and that they should be able to pass on their wealth to
their descendants. Their supporters said that if American works of
art fell into the public domain 20 years before European ones, the
United States would lose its advantage in the international trading
arena.
</P>
<P>
   The global economy was cited as a central reason for the other
piece of copyright-related legislation. To protect content on the
so-called information superhighway, Congress voted to limit
liability for online copyright infringement. Proponents called it a
big step forward in freeing companies to expand into electronic
commerce and deliver movies, music and other content over the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The bill limits the infringement liability of Internet access
providers that unknowingly store, transmit or link World Wide Web
users to copyrighted material. Providers like America Online or
Yahoo will not be liable if the transmission is initiated by
another person, if the storage or transmission happens via
automatic technological processes and if no copies of the material
are kept any longer than necessary to complete the transmission.
The provider is also exempt from liability if it did not know that
the material in question infringed a copyright and did not make
money from any activity directly related to infringement.
</P>
<P>
   The bill is so-called implementing legislation for two treaties
agreed upon by the World Intellectual Property Organization, and
Congress must still ratify those treaties. Even though the 105th
Congress is close to adjournment, other copyright-related proposals
are still pending. A list of pending legislation is available on
the U.S. Copyright Office's site on the World Wide Web
(http://lcweb.loc.gov/copyright/penleg.html).
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton is expected to sign both newly passed bills
into law. A text of the Copyright Extension Act can be viewed on
the Web (http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c105:S.505:), as can

Act (http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c105:H.R.2281:). &QL;

ANALYSIS: BELLS AND GTE HOPE TO WIN BY LOSING AT SUPREME COURT 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By SETH SCHIESEL    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   There tend to be two sorts of regulatory disputes in the
communications industry: the wildly Byzantine and the merely
arcane.
</P>
<P>
   The Byzantine seemed on display at the Supreme Court last
Tuesday as some of the United States' most prominent lawyers
wrangled over the Federal Communications Commission's plan for
bringing competition to local telephone markets. They relied not on
broad constitutional principles but on subtle interpretations of
dense subsections of the Telecommunications Act of 1996.
</P>
<P>
   But the complexity of the courtroom arguments tended to obscure
something that became clear later in the week: Some factions within
the local telephone industry might actually prefer to lose a big
part of this case in the interest of expediting a more important
victory later.
</P>
<P>
   At stake are the terms under which the local telephone
incumbents _ the five Bells and GTE Corp. _ must open their
networks to competitors, be they upstarts or long-distance carriers
hoping to enter the local business. The local telephone market is
worth about $100 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``The court realizes that the telecommunications industry is
essentially the central industry,'' said William Barr, the former
attorney general who is now chief counsel for GTE and who argued
before the court on Tuesday. ``This case raised fundamental issues
about how competition will unfold and the structure of that market
in the future.''
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after the Telecommunications Act of 1996 became law, the
FCC issued an order that told the states how to set prices for the
various elements of the local phone companies' networks that
competitors might want to use. In that order, the commission did at
least two things that the Bells and GTE despised.
</P>
<P>
   The first was to mandate what is known as a ``forward-looking''
pricing model. Under such a system, a local incumbent is allowed to
recover only those costs that it would bear if its network were of
the most modern and efficient type. An equivalent would be if a
taxi driver charged customers based on the costs of operating his
car but was told to pretend that his car got 50 miles to the gallon
and was in tip-top shape.
</P>
<P>
   The long-distance companies think that is a great idea because
it gives them cost-effective access to local networks without
having to bear the cost of building such networks themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not economically possible to build loops to every house
in America,'' Bruce Ennis Jr., who argued for the newly merged
long-distance giant MCI Worldcom Inc. at the Supreme Court, said in
an interview, referring to copper telephone lines. ``We need to be
able to lease elements from the incumbents.''
</P>
<P>
   But many taxis, and many equivalent phone networks, are decrepit
gas-guzzlers. The local phone companies think they should be
allowed to pass along the sometimes higher costs of maintaining and
operating even the oldest parts of their networks to the new
carriers that want access to those systems.
</P>
<P>
   Not long after the FCC order came out, the Bells and GTE sued
the government, charging that the Telecommunications Act did not
give the commission authority to tell the states to use a
forward-looking pricing system.
</P>
<P>
   Last year the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in St. Louis
agreed. Significantly, the court did not rule on the merits of the
commission's rules _ whether forward-looking price models were fair
to begin with.
</P>
<P>
   The local phone carriers also challenged another provision of
the FCC's order, which forced them to offer the different parts of
their networks as complete packages for their competitors, largely
alleviating the need for their rivals to do such assembly work
themselves. The St. Louis court ruled against the commission on
that score as well, and both issues were argued at the Supreme
Court last week.
</P>
<P>
   The commission's uniform national pricing rules never went into
effect, forcing the Bells and their competitors to take up the
matter in proceedings before 50 different state utility
commissions.
</P>
<P>
   The upshot, though, is that many, if not most, of the states
have adopted forward-looking pricing schemes that are similar to
what the commission proposed two years ago anyway _ and which the
local phone companies had hoped to avoid. If the Bells and GTE want
to appeal those state decisions, they must litigate state by state.
</P>
<P>
   So now comes the rub for the Bells and GTE. Remember, the 8th
Circuit, which has already demonstrated sympathy for the local
companies, never ruled on whether the forward-looking cost models
were fair. If the local phone industry succeeds in convincing the
Supreme Court that authority to set local-network pricing models
does lie with the states and not with the commission, the fairness
question has no chance of rebounding to the 8th Circuit.
</P>
<P>
   So now some lawyers for the local phone industry are thinking
that it might actually be better for them to lose in the Supreme
Court by having the justices declare that the commission does
indeed have jurisdiction. That would send the case back to the 8th
Circuit. That way, the local companies could hope to have the lower
court consider the merits of forward-looking pricing _ and perhaps
declare it unfair across the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there's a good chance that we lose on jurisdiction,''
said a lawyer who works for a local phone company. ``And to me, No.
1, it's not that bad.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the outcome, an 8th Circuit ruling on the merits of
forward-looking pricing might end up with the same parties back
before the Supreme Court. But for the Bells and GTE, some of their
proponents believe, a loss now might be the best chance at eventual
victory.

ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WITH CYMBERLINE CAKE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN OWEN  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   You can order an ice cream sundae called Shakespeare's
Inspiration at Rosie's Sweet Shoppe in Ashland, Ore. It's just up
the street from the All's Well Herb and Vitamin Shoppe, not far
from Puck's Doughnuts and a motel known as Bard's Inn.
</P>
<P>
   Or you could skip ice cream and doughnuts and head for the city
park where lithia water _ containing at least 20 minerals _ is
offered free of charge. The city fountains were installed in 1911
in hopes that Ashland might become a European-style health spa.
</P>
<P>
   Today Ashland does, in fact, have an international reputation _
for bad water and great drama. The Oregon Shakespeare Festival,
begun in 1935, now employs 430 actors, directors and technicians
almost year-round. Such is the status of the company, it might even
be possible to order ice cream sundaes and Puck's doughnuts
delivered c.o.d. to the green room underneath the open-air
Elizabethan Theatre, where the actors await their cues.
</P>
<P>
   ``On a typical night there might be a chess or backgammon
tournament going on in the green room,'' Seattle actor G. Valmont
Thomas reveals. ``A couple of other people might be reading
books.'' The actors keep track of the play's progress over audio
feeds of two different plays. When they bolt from the green room on
cue they not only have to remember what part they are playing, they
have to remember in which theater they are appearing.
</P>
<P>
   For example this past season Dan Donohue played Sir Benjamin
Backbite in an afternoon performance of ``School for Scandal'' in
the Angus Bowmer Theatre. Then he returned that night to portray
Prince Hal in ``Henry IV'' on the Elizabethan stage.
</P>
<P>
   And save a few doughnuts for Charlie Kimball, who plays seven
different if minor roles during a single performance of ``Henry
IV.''
</P>
<P>
   Those are long days and some cold nights, although a play's
running time may diminish slightly on the outdoor stage. ``When the
temperature dips, there are not nearly as many pregnant pauses,''
production assistant Mark Mezadourian Hughes reports.
</P>
<P>
   Yet it is anticipated that as many as 1,300 actors will audition
for 10 or 12 openings next season in the Oregon Shakespeare Theatre
company.
</P>
<P>
   They must be serving something more satisfying than Puck's
doughnuts in the green room these days. They might even be serving
up portions of:
</P>
<P>
   Shakespearean Salmon Tart
</P>
<P>
   1 unbaked 9-inch pastry shell
</P>
<P>
   1 egg white, lightly beaten
</P>
<P>
   One-half pound smoked salmon, chopped
</P>
<P>
   1 cup grated Swiss cheese
</P>
<P>
   4 eggs
</P>
<P>
   One-and-one-quarter cups half-and-half
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon dillweed
</P>
<P>
   One-half teaspoon salt
</P>
<P>
   Freshly ground black pepper
</P>
<P>
   Preheat oven to 400 degrees. Brush the pastry shell with the egg
white and bake five minutes. Let cool slightly.
</P>
<P>
   Turn the oven to 450 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   Scatter the salmon over the pastry shell and sprinkle with
cheese. Beat all the other ingredients together and pour over the
cheese. Bake 15 minutes, reduce heat to 350 degrees and continue to
bake until the tart is golden and set, about 15 minutes more.
</P>
<P>
   Serves eight members of the Fairy Kingdom from ``A Midsummer
Night's Dream'' or six soldiers serving under Henry IV.
</P>
<P>
   Cymbeline Cake
</P>
<P>
   One-third cup butter
</P>
<P>
   1 cup sifted flour
</P>
<P>
   One-half teaspoon baking powder
</P>
<P>
   One-quarter teaspoon baking soda
</P>
<P>
   One-quarter teaspoon salt
</P>
<P>
   Three-quarters cup sugar
</P>
<P>
   1 egg
</P>
<P>
   One-third cup buttermilk
</P>
<P>
   One-half teaspoon vanilla extract
</P>
<P>
   One-and-one-half cups raspberries
</P>
<P>
   Crumb topping (recipe follows)
</P>
<P>
   Actually, you could use any fresh fruit with this cake. If you
wait until the raspberry season, you can serve this cake next
summer to the Three Musketeers, who will be sharing the green room
with the cast of ``Chicago.''
</P>
<P>
   OK, places everybody! Melt the butter and then allow it to cool
to room temperature. While this is happening, oil or butter the
sides and bottom of an 8-by-8-inch cake pan.
</P>
<P>
   Sift together the flour, baking powder, baking soda and salt.
Add the sugar and mix.
</P>
<P>
   In another bowl thoroughly mix the egg, buttermilk and vanilla.
Add the melted butter and stir again. Dump this muck in with the
flour and stir for a couple of minutes more with a wooden spoon.
</P>
<P>
   Gloop the batter into the prepared cake pan, spread it out
evenly and then scatter the raspberries over the top. Add the final
crumb topping and shove the cake into a 375-degree oven for about
40 minutes. Let the pan cool on a rack and when the cake is just
warm, dish it up with vanilla ice cream on the side.
</P>
<P>
   The Crumb Topping
</P>
<P>
   One-half cup firmly packed brown sugar
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons flour
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon butter in small bits
</P>
<P>
   One-half ounce (or about two tablespoons) grated semisweet
chocolate
</P>
<P>
   Dump those ingredients into a food processor, give it a blast
until the topping is the consistency of damp dirt.
</P>
<P>
   In the green room at Ashland, they probably assign somebody from
the Rapier and Dagger Workshop to slice the tarts and cakes.

NUTTING OUT: PEANUTS CAN CAUSE REAL ALLERGIC PROBLEMS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By GREGORY ROBERTS  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Consider the peanut.
</P>
<P>
   Is it:
</P>
<P>
   a) A nutritious food that Americans eat _ in various forms _ at
the rate of 8 pounds per person per year?
</P>
<P>
   b) A symbol for anything petty or insignificant _ ``he works for
peanuts?''
</P>
<P>
   c) Not a nut at all, but a legume related to peas, beans,
soybeans and licorice?
</P>
<P>
   d) A deadly killer capable of triggering fatal allergic
reactions?
</P>
<P>
   The answer, of course, is ``all of the above.'' But it's d), the
deadly killer part, that's been attracting attention lately.
</P>
<P>
   In August, the federal Department of Transportation ordered
airlines to set aside a least three peanut-free rows of seats on a
flight if an allergic passenger requests it.
</P>
<P>
   More recently, newspapers have carried reports of schools
banning peanuts and peanut butter from their lunchrooms in response
to demands by parents of highly allergic children.
</P>
<P>
   Columnists and commentators have hooted at the absurdity of it
all _ or fretted over the specter of a world where nothing is
permitted and everything is forbidden.
</P>
<P>
   Are we headed down that Orwellian path? After all, peanuts are
just the tip of an iceberg. Many other foods also may cause
problems, some of them severe.
</P>
<P>
   Peanuts are regarded as the leading culprit for school-age
children, but should they be banned?
</P>
<P>
   Not according to food-allergy advocacy groups and allergy
doctors, who say eliminating offending foods is not the best
strategy for handling the threat.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way to combat that is education and awareness, for anyone
who serves food to anyone else _ whether it's a restaurant or an
airlines or a school,'' said Anne Munoz-Furlong, founder and
director of the Food Allergy Network, a nationwide advocacy group
headquartered in Fairfax, Va.
</P>
<P>
   ``They need to understand that food allergies can be deadly to
some people.''
</P>
<P>
   A ban is counterproductive, she said. ``Inevitably, it divides
the community and you can't do what you need to do, which is work
together.''
</P>
<P>
   A ban also can produce a false sense of security, the network
says, noting that one school banned peanuts, only to have an
allergic child accidentally eat them twice _ in baked goods and
candies.
</P>
<P>
   Food restrictions may make sense on airplanes, which are
crowded, cramped and recirculate their air, says Dr. Dominick
Minotti, a Seattle allergist and partner in the Northwest Asthma
and Allergy Center clinic.
</P>
<P>
   But for school cafeterias and other, more open settings, he's
opposed to such draconian measures.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's better to face the reality of our society,''
Minotti said. ``For food allergies, the more that we can educate
the kids themselves that have that allergy and also their peers,
the better off we're going to be in dealing with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Parents who throw down the gauntlet of
your-kid's-lunch-or-my-kid's-life are motivated by fear and
frustration, Munoz-Furlong said. ``They're not getting what they
need from the school.''
</P>
<P>
   In some cases, she said, schools have backed parents into a
corner by expelling highly allergic students, contending that the
school isn't equipped to deal with the child's condition.
</P>
<P>
   When that happens, aggrieved parents can respond by invoking
federal laws designed to ensure equal access for people with
disabilities, including life-threatening allergies.
</P>
<P>
   A survey of Seattle-area schools didn't turn up any peanut bans
or demands for them by parents. Most schools rely on parents to
deal with their children's allergies by packing lunches to bring to
school.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle Country Day School's enrollment of 300 includes children
with severe peanut allergy, according to administrative assistant
Linda Murray.
</P>
<P>
   While the outside caterer that supplies food for Country Day's
lunchroom takes no special precautions for the allergic children,
the school does inform the children's teachers and classmates about
their condition. It also notifies classmates' parents not to send
snacks with peanuts in them, Murray said.
</P>
<P>
   At the Bush School, another private school in Seattle,
food-service director Rick Schwartz asks parents to inform the
staff of any food allergies, so those children can be monitored and
offending ingredients disclosed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really just a matter of communication,'' Schwartz said.
``Peanut butter has been a staple of school lunches for years.
Quite frankly, I think it's an individual responsibility.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Lake Washington School District, with enrolls 25,000
students in Kirkland and Redmond public schools, the food-service
staff offers four menu choices daily, with an eye to providing safe
options for children with the most common food allergies, spokesman
Richard Duval said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've gotten to the point where we don't put nuts in our
cookies anymore,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The key to coping with food allergies is simply avoiding the
foods that trigger the reactions. That means scrupulous reading of
ingredients lists on packaged foods and persistent interrogations
of restaurant waiters and dinner-party hosts.
</P>
<P>
   That can be burdensome for an adult managing a severe allergy.
But it's even more difficult _ and scary _ for parents of allergic
young children.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have to watch like hawks what their kids eat,'' Minotti
said. ``Parents need to train them about what to look for. As kids
get older, they visit friends, have snacks at school, go to parties
and so on.
</P>
<P>
   ``The vigilance by the child and the training by the parents is
absolutely necessary.''
</P>
<P>
   Avoidance is never easy. Ingredient lists can be a problem
because they aren't always accurate. The Food Allergy Network's
newsletters regularly cite examples of undeclared peanuts, walnuts,
milk or other red-alert foods in packaged products.
</P>
<P>
   Dangers can lurk in unlikely places. In 1986, a student at Brown
University died when she ate chili that had been thickened with
peanut butter. In 1996, Munoz-Furlong said, another college student
died after eating an egg roll at a Chinese restaurant. He had asked
if the roll was fried in peanut oil and had been assured it wasn't,
but he wasn't told that the wrapper was sealed with peanut butter.
</P>
<P>
   For highly allergic people, it doesn't take much. Minotti says
one of his patients, a young girl allergic to fish, was rushed to
the hospital from a shopping-mall food court after her mother cut
the girl's hamburger with a knife that had been used to cut the
mother's fish and chips.
</P>
<P>
   There's no cure for food allergies, and no proven method that
prevents a reaction. Fortunately, there is a life-saving antidote
to a severe reaction: an injection of epinephrine, a prescription
drug also know as adrenaline that rapidly boosts blood pressure and
heart rate, stabilizing the body's vital systems.
</P>
<P>
   For some schoolchildren, the most critical part of their
wardrobe isn't a pair of Air Jordans or a Starter jacket. It's a
fanny pack stuffed with a syringe of epinephrine _ and they never
leave home without it.
</P>
<P>
   For parents of a food-allergic child, here are pointers from the
Food Allergy Network for keeping your children safe at school:
</P>
<P>
   _ Plan ahead. Before school starts, request a meeting with the
school principal, school nurse, cafeteria aide and teacher to
explain your child's food allergies.
</P>
<P>
   _ Role-play with your child on situations that may arise, such
as peer pressure to taste new foods or trade food at snack time or
in the cafeteria.
</P>
<P>
   _ Send a spoil-proof lunch to be kept at school in case your
child forgets or loses lunch one day. For example, a can of fish or
meat, a small package of crackers, canned fruit and a container of
fruit juice.
</P>
<P>

ABC NEWS SHELVES CRITICAL REPORT ON DISNEY
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By LAWRIE MIFFLIN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   After 20 years as an investigative reporter, Brian Ross of ABC
News knows a good story when he hears one. He is also not stupid.
He knew the story he heard last spring might raise difficulties
because it involved ABC's parent, the Walt Disney Co., but he
thought he had enough solid information to pursue it.
</P>
<P>
   The story involved accounts of pedophilia and lax security at
theme-park resorts, including Walt Disney World, and once Ross and
his longtime producer-partner, Rhonda Schwartz, had finished their
reporting, they thought they had a solid investigative piece for
``20/20,'' ABC's news magazine program.
</P>
<P>
   But the report was killed last week, or at least shelved. ABC
News executives refuse to discuss the reasons in detail and have
urged those involved not to discuss the matter publicly. Disney
issued a statement saying that its executives had nothing to do
with the decision.
</P>
<P>
   The saga of the Ross-Schwartz report _ and how ABC dealt with it
_ illustrates the thorny problems reporters have in examining their
own companies, especially in this age of conglomerates, when many
parent companies of media outlets are also involved in many other
businesses. Can reporters investigate them the way they would any
other subject? If not, where must a line be drawn?
</P>
<P>
   ABC News' public comments regarding the Ross-Schwartz report
have come only from Eileen Murphy, the division's chief
spokeswoman, and her efforts to explain the decision also highlight
the sensitivity of dealing with one's own company. At first, Ms.
Murphy would say only that ``the draft report submitted was not
acceptable to ABC News,'' adding that this did not ``reflect badly
on any reporter or producer involved.''
</P>
<P>
   But when pressed for ABC News' thinking on whether there are
limits to investigating its parent company, she said, ``We would
generally not embark on an investigation that focused solely on
Disney, and was not part of a broader story that involved other
companies, for a whole variety of reasons, one of which is that
whatever you come up with, positive or negative, will seem
suspect.''
</P>
<P>
   She emphasized that ABC News would not hesitate to cover any
breaking news story about Disney, as it did when Disney's new
Animal Kingdom theme park was accused of mistreating animals, or
when Southern Baptists announced a boycott of Disney. And she said
ABC would pursue investigative stories that included Disney among
others, like one Ross did for ``20/20'' last spring about companies
that took advantage of cheap laborers on the island of Saipan to
make clothing that they could legally label ``Made in America.''
</P>
<P>
   Ross' investigative instincts were roused again last spring when
Ms. Schwartz told him about a telephone call she received from
Peter Schweizer, an author who had worked with the Ross-Schwartz
team on two stories about five years ago, when the two were at NBC
News.
</P>
<P>
   This time, Schweizer was offering an exclusive look at galleys
of a book he and his wife, Rochelle Schweizer, were finishing on
Disney, which had a chapter contending that several Disney theme
parks had experienced problems with pedophiles and had resisted
cooperating with law enforcement agencies.
</P>
<P>
   Schweizer offered his book as what he called ``a jumping-off
point'' for an investigation by Ross, who had won many awards
during his 18 years at NBC News, including a George Foster Peabody
Award and two George Polk Awards. That record prompted ABC News to
lure him away from NBC four years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Ross, because of his status and because he reports for several
different programs, has a separate unit of his own within ABC News
and is not supervised by any single executive producer. When he has
a project that may raise legal or ethical questions, he is expected
to discuss it with Richard Wald, the senior vice president for
editorial quality.
</P>
<P>
   He did so last spring. While details of their talk remain
private, both men clearly expected Ross to investigate problems
with pedophilia and law enforcement at theme parks in general, not
just at Disney World.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Wald sent a letter on June 24 to Regnery Publishing,
the Schweizers' publisher, saying that Ross wanted to interview
Schweizer and have exclusive access to materials gathered for the
Schweizers' book, titled ``Disney: The Mouse Betrayed,'' which was
published in September. In the letter, Wald describes Ross' project
as a report ``on the problems of employing undesirable persons at
places like resorts and theme parks,'' adding that ``Disney World
might be part of that.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Schwartz and Ross spent much of the summer pursuing the
story, and according to several people who worked with them, they
re-interviewed people interviewed by the Schweizers, relocated
police and court records and discovered additional cases of
pedophilia and peeping-Tom incidents not found by the Schweizers.
These people said the Ross-Schwartz team had examined more than a
dozen theme-park resorts, mostly in Florida, but had found that
Disney's resorts had more problems than others and that many
Florida law-enforcement officials said the security staff at the
Walt Disney World Resort complex in Orlando was more uncooperative
than staffs elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   At this point the tricky problem of how far reporters can go in
investigating their employers arose for Ross and Ms. Schwartz. If
they had set out only to examine Disney resorts, then by Ms.
Murphy's definition of ABC guidelines, their project presumably
would have been dead from the start. But they were given the
go-ahead in part because they planned to examine other theme parks,
too.
</P>
<P>
   Ross and Ms. Schwartz then had this problem: How could they not
focus their report primarily on Disney if that is what their
reporting found the facts to be?
</P>
<P>
   Wald and David Westin, president of ABC News, had a similar
problem: How could they allow such a report to be broadcast if they
believed it focused excessively on Disney and not others in the
theme-park business?
</P>
<P>
   Ross and Ms. Schwartz finished a draft version of their report
earlier this month and submitted it to Wald and Westin for review.
On Tuesday, Ross and Westin had a shouting match over Westin's
decision to shelve the report _ shouting that included Ross asking
whether he should ``call his agent'' and Westin saying he would
accept Ross' resignation on the spot _ but apologies were made
afterward. People close to both men insist they respect each other
and each other's position in this affair.
</P>
<P>
   Westin was then left with the problem of whether to explain the
decision to kill the report. If ABC News believed the reporting was
insufficient or inconclusive, to say so would mean publicly
criticizing their own highly regarded investigative team. But to
keep quiet would make outsiders suspect that ABC had killed the
report out of fear of hurting Disney's theme-park business.
</P>
<P>
   A senior ABC News executive, speaking on the condition of
anonymity, said that whatever the reasons, to discuss them publicly
``would have a chilling effect'' on future deliberations among
producers, reporters and executives, who would be forced to worry
that their private comments might become public.
</P>
<P>
   But an equally important issue is whether ABC journalists will
feel chilled from pursuing stories about Disney. As a Ross admirer
at ABC News said, Ross ``tested the outer boundaries of reporting
on Disney and found them.''

MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES BEWILDERED BY CHANGES IN HEALTHCARE
COVERAGE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., N.Y.)  (js) 
 By ROBERT PEAR    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Tens of thousands of Medicare beneficiaries being
dropped from health maintenance organizations have suddenly found
themselves in a confusing predicament, with no reliable information
about their options and no guarantee of coverage for costly
prescription drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the Clinton administration and the health insurance
industry disagree over the rights and protections available to such
Medicare beneficiaries, who receive a bewildering variety of
conflicting information when they try to buy private insurance to
supplement Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   Federal officials acknowledged that their interpretation of the
Medicare law would not necessarily be accepted by all the companies
that sell insurance to fill gaps in Medicare, known as Medigap
insurance. Such companies are regulated primarily by the states,
and many said they were unfamiliar with their new obligations to
consumers under federal law, as interpreted by the administration.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, some insurers contend that they do not have to
comply with the federal insurance standards until states adopt laws
and regulations to carry them out.
</P>
<P>
   One person affected by the changes, Anthony DeMarco, an
87-year-old retired purchasing agent in Paso Robles, Calif., said
he had been desperately trying to arrange coverage since he learned
a few weeks ago that he would be dropped by his HMO. ``The problem
now is that I've got to go out and find something I can afford,''
he said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   DeMarco said he had had excellent coverage under an HMO for $32
a month, but would probably have to pay $114 a month for insurance
to supplement the traditional Medicare program, to which he is
returning.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Fertschneider, 72, of Atascadero, Calif., said he was in a
similar quandary. ``It's very disconcerting not to know how we are
going to manage after the end of December,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Doris Cole-Hatchard, a 66-year-old retiree being dropped by the
Oxford HMO in Rockland County, N.Y., said she was eager to get a
Medigap policy covering prescription drugs because she was taking
medications for angina, high blood pressure and high cholesterol.
But she said she was ``very upset'' when she found that the premium
would be $270 a month.
</P>
<P>
   HMOs in 29 states have notified the federal government that they
are pulling out of Medicare or reducing their service areas on Jan.
1, in part because their costs are rising faster than expected. The
actions will affect more than 414,000 beneficiaries.
</P>
<P>
   Elyse Politi, the Medicare managed care ombudsman in northern
Virginia, said, ``The biggest concern for consumers here is that
they haven't received any official notices from the Health Care
Financing Administration or from the HMOs about what their options
will be when the HMOs terminate their Medicare contracts on
December 31.''
</P>
<P>
   Judith Stein, director of the Center for Medicare Advocacy in
Willimantic, Conn., said: ``There's a lot of fear and confusion, a
feeling of abandonment among seniors. They were encouraged to join
these HMOs, and the plans have now decided to leave. It's a very
volatile situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Beneficiaries have two basic options. They can enroll in another
HMO, if one is available in their area and if it has the capacity
to take new customers. Or they can enroll in the original Medicare
program, with or without Medigap insurance.
</P>
<P>
   Federal officials emphasize that the traditional Medicare
program is always available. But they acknowledge that it often
costs more than an HMO, and they say there is no guarantee that
beneficiaries can obtain Medigap policies covering prescription
drugs, one of the biggest medical expenses for people who are
elderly or disabled.
</P>
<P>
   There are 10 standard Medigap policies designated ``A'' through
``J.'' Federal officials say that a person dropped from a Medicare
HMO has a right to buy certain types of Medigap insurance in the
first 63 days of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The Medigap policies that must be made available _ the ones
designated ``A,'' ``B,'' ``C'' and ``F'' _ provide basic benefits,
but do not cover prescription drugs.
</P>
<P>
   In a series of questions and answers for Medicare beneficiaries,
the Clinton administration says that private insurance to cover
prescription drugs is available, but that consumers must seek out
such coverage on their own. Moreover, it says, ``These plans may
refuse to sell you a policy based on your health status.''
</P>
<P>
   Bonnie Burns, director of consumer education at California's
statewide insurance counseling program, said Medicare beneficiaries
faced a grim paradox. ``If you have a health condition that causes
you to use prescription drugs,'' she said, ``it's unlikely that a
Medigap insurance company will sell you a new policy covering
prescription drugs.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Burns said that insurance counselors had been overwhelmed
with telephone calls from people being dropped by Medicare HMOs.
</P>
<P>
   ``These people were lured into HMOs by low premiums and generous
prescription drug coverage, and they are distressed because they
don't know how they will cope with the costs,'' Burns said. ``Many
don't even know what rights and options they have.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The administration says an insurance company may not attach
restrictions to Medigap policies ``A,'' ``B,'' ``C'' and ``F'' by
limiting the coverage of pre-existing medical conditions. Likewise,
it tells consumers, an insurer may not ``discriminate in the price
of the policy because of your health status, claims experience,
receipt of health care or medical condition.''
</P>
<P>
   Federal officials said these protections applied to disabled
people, as well as to the elderly. But Charles Kahn III, chief
operating officer of the Health Insurance Association of America,
strenuously disagreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Clinton administration is trying to set health policy by
administrative fiat,'' Kahn said. ``Congress had an opportunity to
change the rules for the disabled last year and chose not to do
so.''
</P>
<P>
   Further, Kahn said: ``Disabled people who choose to buy Medigap
policies are likely to have higher health costs than the average
senior covered by Medicare and Medigap. Requiring insurance
companies to sell Medigap policies to the disabled, at standard
rates regardless of their claims experience, will lead inevitably
to higher Medigap premiums for the elderly.''
</P>
<P>
   Premiums were already rising rapidly, with many Medigap insurers
reporting a cumulative increase of more than 45 percent over the
last three years.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas McCormack, an expert on health benefits for people with
disabilities, said: ``Insurance companies usually avoid selling
Medigap policies to disabled people under 65. They restrict the
benefits or charge prohibitive premiums, much higher than those
charged to the elderly.''
</P>
<P>
   Carl Scott, senior vice president of Mutual of Omaha Cos., said
Medigap insurers were being forced to subsidize HMOs bailing out of
Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   ``After enrolling all these Medicare beneficiaries, HMOs are
dumping them back into the market, presumably because they've
become unprofitable,'' Scott said. ``We have to absorb them. It's
an unfair tax on our Medicare supplement policyholders, who'll have
to pay higher premiums.'' Mutual of Omaha provides Medigap coverage
to 200,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   The American Association of Retired Persons offers popular
Medigap policies underwritten by United Healthcare. Telephone
operators at United said this coverage was available only to
members of the association.
</P>
<P>
   But it is unclear whether federal law allows such restrictions.
Under the administration's reading of the law, Medicare
beneficiaries dropped from an HMO should be able to buy any of the
four designated policies, regardless of whether they belong to the
association. A spokesman for the organization said membership dues
were $8 a year.

EL DUQUE'S CALM ALLOWS HIM TO ADJUST
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.Y., Fla., Calif., Ohio)   (jw) 
 By DAVE ANDERSON    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Orlando Hernandez had been in spring training with
the Yankees for only a few days in March when the Florida weather
turned raw and cold, but he continued to wear Bermuda shorts and a
cotton golf shirt.
</P>
<P>
   ``You ought to get some warmer clothes,'' somebody suggested.
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' the pitcher known as El Duque said. ``I must adjust.''
</P>
<P>
   Even in those months before he joined the Yankees, this was a
thinking man's pitcher who knew that the weather in the United
States sometimes would not be anywhere near as warm as it was in
Cuba, that he had to learn to acclimate himself to the occasional
chill.
</P>
<P>
   But baseball's October weather, which in other years has been
known to dip into the 40s, if not the 30s, has been kind to El
Duque.
</P>
<P>
   When he rescued the Yankees in Cleveland a week ago Saturday
night, squaring the American League Championship Series at 2-2, the
game-time temperature was a comfortable 57 degrees, balmy for the
Lake Erie shore in October.
</P>
<P>
   And when he went to the mound against the San Diego Padres at
Yankee Stadium on Sunday night in the second game of the World
Series, the temperature again was balmy and pleasant. But
regardless, the Yankees would have expected El Duque to adjust,
just as he has adjusted so quickly to everything else _ American
culture, Yankee tradition, major league hitters.
</P>
<P>
   From the time El Duque joined the Yankees in early June, Joe
Torre has talked about the calm that the now 29-year-old
right-hander has displayed, no matter what the adjustment.
</P>
<P>
   If that calm wasn't in him, El Duque, who had been banned from
Cuba's national team, would not have climbed on a small boat in
February with seven others and a few cans of Spam and drifted
across the Caribbean to Anguila Cay and eventually to the Yankees
and the World Series.
</P>
<P>
   That calm was there when El Duque was asked whether his Cuban
companions on the boat were his guests at Saturday night's Series
opener. He handled that conversation as if he were pitching,
throwing his fastball from different angles, then busting his
curveball for a called third strike.
</P>
<P>
   ``Did they come?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was told they came,'' his questioner said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who told you that?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the broadcasters from Miami.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, they are here,'' he said. ``Now that you told me who told
you, we're even.''
</P>
<P>
   No, he was way ahead.
</P>
<P>
   El Duque didn't appear awed by the World Series. He had seen it
in Cuba on television. When his half-brother, Livan Hernandez,
pitched the Florida Marlins to the World Series title a year ago,
he watched the games in the CNN studios in Havana.
</P>
<P>
   When he was asked if, as a member of Cuba's national team, he
had ever pitched in a game similar to the magnitude of the Series,
his calm was there.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know I've pitched in three world championships, one
Olympics, also various other tournaments I don't remember,'' he
said through his interpreter, Leonardo Astacio. ``And in Cuba, I
pitched in many league championships and national titles, I don't
know if you could compare them to the magnitude of the World
Series, but they're pretty big.''
</P>
<P>
   And when El Duque was asked if he ever surprised himself when
pitching, his calm was there.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never really surprise myself on the mound,'' he replied.
``Because if I did it, then there's no reason for me to be
surprised because it's something I did.''
</P>
<P>
   Torre called it a calm, but Brian Cashman, the Yankee general
manager, called it something else.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we brought El Duque into camp, he had a presence about
him even then,'' Cashman said, ``I remember Joe Torre watched him
throw in the outfield and he told me, `This guy is intriguing.'''
</P>
<P>
   El Duque had already intrigued Lin Garrett, the Yankee scouting
director, when put on display for scouts in Costa Rica.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lin told me, `You've got to get this guy, he can be our No. 3
starter this year,' '' Cashman recalled. ``Anaheim and Cleveland
also were after him. Anaheim's offer supposedly included a movie
deal. Cleveland was offering good money.''
</P>
<P>
   Cleveland's offer was between $2 million and $3 million, but the
Yankees put together a four-year, $6.6 million offer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some scouts for other clubs didn't think El Duque had enough
fastball, and they also wondered about his age,'' Cashman said.
``The way we figured it, if he signed with us, he's 28. If he
signed with somebody else, he's got wooden teeth.''
</P>
<P>
   But whatever El Duque's age, whatever his teeth, whatever the
weather, it's his calm that the Yankees like best.

LEVI STRAUSS LAUNCHES EFFORT TO WIN GAY MARKET
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.Y., Calif., Wyo., N.J.)   (jw) 
 By STUART ELLIOTT    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Intensifying its efforts to reach younger, more
fashion-conscious consumers, Levi Strauss &AMP; Co. is embarking on its
most ambitious marketing campaign aimed at gay men and lesbians.
</P>
<P>
   Levi Strauss, the nation's largest apparel advertiser, is
sponsoring ``Inside Out,'' a 12-page advertorial supplement in the
November issue of Out magazine, which goes to subscribers and
newsstands starting this week. The advertorial, peddling Dockers
khaki pants, features 10 men and women who are openly homosexual
and is part of a campaign that includes contributions from Levi
Strauss and its Red Tab Foundation to two organizations that help
gay youth and fight homophobia in schools: the Gay, Lesbian and
Straight Education Network and the Hetrick Martin Institute.
</P>
<P>
   Levi Strauss is one of a growing number of companies aiming
sales pitches at homosexuals for products from cars to computers.
Even a new toothpaste, Mentadent Crystal Ice, is being advertised
by Unilever, the consumer products giant, in The Advocate, the
national gay and lesbian news magazine.
</P>
<P>
   The Dockers campaign, indicative of what is known as
cause-related marketing, is part of a comprehensive program by Levi
Strauss to reverse flagging sales among the trend-setting consumers
born after the baby boomers. Other steps include promotions
centered on independent films, an ``urban networking'' campaign
honoring achievements by Generation X and hip, edgy advertising
from the TBWA/Chiat/Day unit of Omnicom Group.
</P>
<P>
   The program is particularly focused on reaching younger
consumers through music. For instance, Details magazine, part of
the Conde Nast Publications unit of Advance Publications, brought
together the Levi's jeans brand sold by Levi Strauss with the Red
Hot Organization, which raises money to fight AIDS by releasing
themed albums featuring popular musicians.
</P>
<P>
   For Dockers, a brand ``associated with casual Fridays,'' said
Mark Malinowski, senior marketing specialist for Levi Strauss USA,
``we want more of an urban sensibility.''
</P>
<P>
   ``First and foremost, we're trying to reach 25- to
34-year-olds,'' he added, ``whom we call urban modernists. When we
looked at who made up that group, gay men and lesbians are a large
part of it.''
</P>
<P>
   But when ``marketing to them,'' Malinowski said, ``it can't just
be about advertising,'' because gay consumers want marketers ``to
place our brands in front of them in a meaningful, relevant way.''
In a survey by Greenfield Online Inc. and Spare Parts Inc., a
marketing communications company, 80 percent of respondents said
they preferred to buy from companies that spoke to them as
homosexuals.
</P>
<P>
   So the advertorial _ reminiscent of ``Men We Love,'' an annual
editorial feature in Genre magazine _ ``is not about the pants,''
Malinowski said. ``It's about the people.''
</P>
<P>
   The men and women, shown wearing Dockers in photographs shot by
Carter Smith, include activists as well as the inevitable actors.
Yet even the stars contribute to causes; one, Mitchell Anderson, is
a spokesman for the Human Rights Campaign, an advocacy
organization.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to make sure the section had the right feel,'' said
Louis Fabrizio, vice president and publisher at Out in New York,
owned by Out Publishing Inc., ``and not have everyone be a
television celebrity.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is Dockers putting its money where its mouth is,'' he
added. ``I don't think there's a problem with companies making
money from the gay market if they're recognizing us in our
environment, celebrating who were are, and have progressive
policies as corporations. It's so good when a company like Levi
Strauss does all that.''
</P>
<P>
   Those involved with the project say they believe it has become
more meaningful after the beating death of Matthew Shepard, the
openly gay student at the University of Wyoming. The murder
``drives it home even harder that we need to be out there to help
educate people and fight against ignorance and hatred,'' Malinowski
said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In interviews with four people in the advertorial, none
expressed qualms about its commercialism.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be naive not to recognize that we live in a culture
where advertising has a tremendous influence,'' said Rea Carey,
executive director of the National Youth Advocacy Coalition.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly Dockers is interested in increasing the visibility
of its product,'' she added. ``But we're also interested in raising
the visibility of issues affecting gay youth.''
</P>
<P>
   James Dale, who won a court fight with the Boy Scouts, said:
``Before this, I would not have worn Dockers. But this is something
that Dockers specifically did for the community, and I like that. I
don't see it as pandering; it's more substantive and respectful.''
A New Jersey appeals court ruled in March that the Boy Scouts
violated the state's anti-discrimination law by ousting Dale, an
Eagle Scout, because he is gay.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't have taken part in this if I thought I were being
used,'' said Bruce Hayes, an Olympic gold medal swimmer in 1984.
</P>
<P>
   The other participants in the advertorial are the young actor
Wilson Cruz; Thomas Rollerson, who founded Dalmatian Dreams, which
grants wishes to terminally ill adults; author Brad Gooch;
photographer Eve Fowler; actress Guinevere Turner, and Max
Mutchnick, who with David Kohan runs Komut Entertainment, creating
and serving as executive producers of the new NBC sitcom ``Will and
Grace.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no issue with the commerce side of this,'' said
Mutchnick, adding that he would sell toilet cleaner ``if in the
tiniest way'' it would help ``someone being more comfortable coming
out.''
</P>
<P>
   The advertorial may provide fodder for ``Will and Grace,'' which
is focused on Grace, a young woman; Will, her best friend, who is
gay, and Jack, Will's outspoken gay friend.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's such a thing in the gay community that if you look
at'' the back of a man's pants, Mutchnick said, laughing, ``and you
see a Dockers logo, he's straight; you don't bother. So I may have
Jack and Will both interested in the same guy, but what's holding
them back is that the first time they met him he was in a pair of
Dockers.''

A MAVERICK SPANISH JUDGE'S TWO-YEAR QUEST FOR PINOCHET'S ARREST 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also PINOCHET-CHILE, PINOCHET-BRITAIN, PINOCHET-LAW) 
(js) 
 By MARLISE SIMONS    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ A stubbornly independent judge who more than once has
challenged the Spanish government, Baltasar Garzon was ridiculed
when he first set out to pursue the most notorious right-wing
generals in South America for human rights crimes committed in the
1970s and '80s, offenses for which they had already been granted
amnesty at home.
</P>
<P>
   Now, after Garzon succeeded in getting Scotland Yard to arrest
Chile's former dictator, Gen. Augusto Pinochet, the Spanish
magistrate has suddenly moved closer to creating an important legal
precedent, one that could make the retirement of former dictators
decidedly uncomfortable.
</P>
<P>
   While this is certainly his most spectacular strike, the Madrid
judge has long been at the center of controversy. Even before
taking on the cases against former military rulers in Argentina as
well as Chile, he had earned a high profile in Spain by
investigating some of the country's most explosive issues, among
them drug trafficking, Basque terrorism and government corruption.
</P>
<P>
   The judge, despite his professorial look, lives a tense life and
has said that he had to grow used to living with death threats. He
moves around with bodyguards and works under tight security in the
offices of the Madrid special criminal tribunal, known as the
National Court.
</P>
<P>
   His critics have often accused him of self-promotion because he
takes on major cases and frequently appears on the front pages of
newspapers. But Garzon, in a recent interview, responded that he is
determined to expose crime in high places too easily overlooked and
that in talking to the media he helps to prevent sensitive cases
from being covered up.
</P>
<P>
   His involvement with South America began in 1996 when he opened
a criminal investigation after several Spanish legal associations
asked him to look into the torture, disappearance and killing of
Spanish citizens in Argentina during that country's military rule
from 1976 to 1983.
</P>
<P>
   Garzon, who works as an investigating magistrate rather than a
judge on the bench, took more than five months to conclude that a
Spanish court could have jurisdiction in the case. He argued that,
under Spanish and international law, specifically under the Geneva
Conventions, serious crimes involving human rights can be tried
anywhere and are not subject to any time limit.
</P>
<P>
   Garzon felt encouraged not only by support from international
legal scholars and a U.N. committee, but also by the new efforts of
Western powers to insure trials and punishment for those
responsible for grave human rights violations, including genocide,
in Rwanda and the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   Soon, he brought charges against 110 former and active military
and police officers in Argentina and issued international arrest
warrants against at least 11 senior Argentine military officers,
including a former president, Gen. Leopoldo Galtieri. That meant
countries that are part of the Interpol agreement would have to
arrest the officers if they traveled outside Argentina.
</P>
<P>
   Following the case against Argentina's security forces, another
judge serving in the same court as Garzon opened an investigation
into the torture and killing of Spaniards in Chile during the
17-year Pinochet dictatorship that ended in 1990. Garzon is now
involved in both countries, and the cases have widened to embrace
not just the killing of Spaniards but victims of other
nationalities.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Since the case against Pinochet began at Madrid's National
Court, the United States has agreed to provide the Spanish judges
with documents related to human rights violations under the
Pinochet regime. The Madrid court has charged Pinochet and other
members of the Chilean high command with crimes against humanity,
including genocide and terrorism, involving the deaths of more than
4,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   Both extraterritorial investigations have drawn scorn from the
civilian governments in Argentina and Chile, which have argued that
the accused military officers have all benefited from amnesties and
that no foreign judge can alter that.
</P>
<P>
   Spain's conservative prime minister, Jose Maria Aznar, has also
told Buenos Aires and Santiago that he disapproves of the
investigations, but that he cannot stop them. He and other
government officials have complained that the judge's activities
are complicating their diplomatic relations and risk affecting
Madrid's current strategy of expanding its business investments in
Argentina and Chile. But the judges have continued to press
forward.
</P>
<P>
   On Oct. 14, learning that Pinochet had entered Britain for
medical treatment, Garzon asked British judicial authorities to
hold the former dictator until Spanish investigators could
interrogate him about a series of crimes, particularly those
committed under a so-called Operation Condor in which Argentina and
Chile cooperated in torturing and killing several hundred of their
political opponents.
</P>
<P>
   British authorities informed Garzon that Pinochet would be
released from the hospital over the weekend and that they could not
legally detain him. Garzon then issued an arrest warrant against
Pinochet, specifically linking him to the case of a Chilean
citizen, Edgardo Henriquez, who in April 1976 was kidnapped and
tortured in Argentina and soon after handed over to the Chilean
secret police, then under Pinochet's command. He has since been
missing.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Garzon will reportedly broaden the arrest warrant by
adding the names of close to 80 additional victims, who were also
kidnapped in Argentina and handed over to the Chilean secret police
as part of Operation Condor. A lawyer familiar with the proceedings
said Garzon will also formalize his request that Britain extradite
Pinochet to Spain.
</P>
<P>
   However, before it can be transmitted to British authorities,
the extradition request must first be accepted by Spain's Ministry
of Justice and then approved by Aznar and his cabinet. Aznar, who
is known to favor turning down the request, has given no clear
indication yet of the outcome.

MEDIA TALK: SHORT LIST FOR NEWSWEEK EDITOR; MEDIA'S POOR IMAGE;
L.A. TIMES BROADENS LATINO COVERAGE; MINORITIES IN MAGAZINES;

   The editor at Newsweek magazine needs the management skills of
an eagle-eyed chief executive, the energy of a distance runner and
the composure of the Mona Lisa. Maynard Parker, the editor from
1982 until his death on Friday, had all of those qualities, those
who worked with him say.
</P>
<P>
   ``His credo was `More, faster, better,''' said Michael Elliott,
editor of international editions. ``Watching him edit was like
watching someone edit by lightning, not watching someone edit by
60-watt bulb.''
</P>
<P>
   Washington Post Co., which owns the magazine, is not expected to
announce a successor for at least several weeks. The list of
potential editors includes Ann McDaniel, Newsweek's Washington
bureau chief; Elliott; assistant managing editor Evan Thomas, and
managing editor Mark Whitaker, who was Parker's first deputy and
has been responsible for day-to-day operations since Parker became
ill.
</P>
<P>
   Among the Newsweek staff, most bets are on Whitaker, who began
his Newsweek career as an intern in 1977, before graduating from
Harvard University in 1979. One staff member said any other choice
would be ``astonishing.'' If Whitaker were chosen, he would become
the highest-ranking black journalist in the country.
</P>
<P>
   Whitaker has overseen coverage of the Monica Lewinsky matter and
of crises in Bosnia and Somalia. He has contributed essays on race,
including one titled ``The Verdict'' after the O.J. Simpson trial.
</P>
<P>
   The choice of Ms. McDaniel would mark a different milestone: She
would be Newsweek's first woman editor. She is a close friend of
Parker and holds three titles: assistant managing editor,
Washington bureau chief and chief of correspondents.
</P>
<P>
   Elliott oversees Newsweek's international coverage as well as
international editions in six languages.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas was Washington bureau chief for 10 years until 1996, and
is a frequent guest on the talk-show circuit. He is at work on a
biography of Robert F. Kennedy.

   Scandals Don't Much Harm an Already Bad Reputation
</P>
<P>
   Has the recent spate of journalistic scandals damaged the
media's credibility? There's a good news/bad news answer.
</P>
<P>
   A public opinion poll by the nonprofit Media Studies Center
found most people haven't noticed the scandals. But it also found
that not many had a high opinion of journalists to begin with.
</P>
<P>
   The pollsters found that 42 percent of those surveyed had heard
of the scandal in which CNN retracted a report that the U.S.
military used nerve gas. Eleven percent knew about an investigative
project by The Cincinnati Enquirer in which the reporter stole
voice mail messages. The dismissal of two columnists at The Boston
Globe was known to 21 percent, and 12 percent were aware of the
dismissal of Stephen Glass of The New Republic for fabricating
information in more than two dozen articles.
</P>
<P>
   The scandals did not seem to affect how much people read or
watched the news. In Boston, 67 percent of those surveyed knew
something about the scandal at The Globe, which is owned by New
York Times Co., but only 3 percent said they were reading the paper
less than before. One percent said they were reading it more.
</P>
<P>
   The poll found that 67 percent thought journalists often or
sometimes invent stories, 76 percent thought they often or
sometimes plagiarize, 87 percent felt they often or sometimes use
unethical or illegal tactics and 86 percent believed that stories
often or sometimes have factual errors.
</P>
<P>
   ``The attitude of many Americans toward journalists when these
things happen seems to be, `There they go again,''' said Robert
Giles, executive director of the Media Studies Center.

   The Los Angeles Times Assembles a `Latino Team'
</P>
<P>
   In its effort to broaden coverage of minority communities and
meet its ambitious circulation goals, The Los Angeles Times is
establishing an 11-member ``Latino team'' that will include
reporters in the business, cultural, sports and general news
departments. It will meet daily and plan coverage of Latino issues
throughout the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   The team represents the latest in a series of efforts to
increase both coverage of Latino affairs and the newspaper's
circulation in the Hispanic population. About a third of residents
in the five-county area around Los Angeles are Hispanic and about
19 percent of the newspaper's readers are, according to the paper's
research. The publisher, Mark Willes, who is also chairman and
chief executive of the newspaper's parent, Times-Mirror Co., has
said he wants to increase the newspaper's circulation by 50
percent, to about 1.5 million. He provoked widespread opposition by
suggesting separate space for Latino news.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a better idea than a Latino section,'' said Vicki
Torres, a small-business columnist, ``because the Latino team then
makes sure that there's something throughout the paper, as part of
our ongoing coverage, that addresses Latinos.''
</P>
<P>
   The paper will add positions for a reporter specializing in
relations between Mexico and the United States, a national Hispanic
affairs reporter with a counterpart in the Los Angeles area, a
religion reporter and a photographer who doubles as a photo editor.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are a kind of Latino capital,'' said Frank del Olmo, the
associate editor heading the team. The idea, he said, is ``to try
to get as far ahead of the curve as we can on Latino stories.''

   Minorities at 6.1 Percent on Major Magazine Staffs
</P>
<P>
   How well are minority groups represented in the magazine
industry?
</P>
<P>
   A survey commissioned by the trade magazine Mediaweek included
interviews with 165 of the top 300 magazines as ranked by
circulation. It found people of color represent 6.1 percent of
professional staff _ from nonclerical editorial staff, freelance
writers and sales staff up through the publisher's level.
</P>
<P>
   A breakdown showed these percentages: blacks 2.6; Hispanics
1.5., native Americans, 0.3, Asian-Americans, 1.7. The survey was
done by Fairfield Research in Lincoln, Neb.

   Advice About Clothing and a Snug Fit for the Ads
</P>
<P>
   For anyone who has wondered who invented dry cleaning or how to
care for mohair, Martha Stewart has come to the rescue. This month,
Martha Stewart Living published a special issue titled
``Clotheskeeping,'' devoted to the maintenance of _ and how to
choose _ classic clothing.
</P>
<P>
   Apart from the hijinks of Monsieur Jolly-Bollin (the father of
modern dry cleaning), what's intriguing about the
``Clotheskeeping'' issue is that it has only one advertiser: 33
pages of the Gap.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, the Gap aesthetic is Stewart-friendly. Folded in the
bureau (page 73) and dangling from the ironing board (page 22) are
Gap items. More are on pages 54, 63 and 69 _ and on the cover,
which shows shirts from the Gap, along with some from Barneys and
Agnes B.
</P>
<P>
   A coincidence?
</P>
<P>
   Marlene Kahan, president of the American Society of Magazine
Editors, which monitors the practices of magazine editors, said
that she was ``concerned'' about the use of Gap shirts on the
cover. But Suzanne Sobel, publisher of Martha Stewart Living,
published by Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia LLC, said there was
nothing unusual in the magazine's dealings with Gap Inc. ``We
didn't see the ads prior to them delivering them, and they didn't
see the editorial,'' she said. ``But we do have the same taste.''
</P>
<P>
   Allen Adamson, managing director at Landor Associates, a New
York brand consulting firm that is part of Young &AMP; Rubicam, saw
criticism of Ms. Stewart as likely. ``How far can you push the
envelope on editorial credibility and advertising promotion?'' he
asked. ``For someone as powerful an authority on what is right and
what is in, there will be a little nipping and tugging on her
credibility.'' He said he thought damage would be minimal but
added, ``Any illusion that this is not a
promotional-slash-infomercial use is a fallacy.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Sobel sees no problem. ``We really handled this so it would
not appear infomercialized,'' she said. ``There was no collusion
whatsoever.'' She added: ``We've gotten calls from so many
advertisers this week wanting to do the same thing.''

<P>
   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa _ The anonymous caller to the police
claimed there were many illegal immigrants working at the Galaxy
clothing shop downtown.
</P>
<P>
   But among the cardboard boxes of cheap blue jeans and polyester
shirts, the police found only one likely suspect _ a neatly dressed
young salesman with the sharp features, dark skin and wavy hair of
a northern African. When he could not produce identity papers, the
immigration officers quietly escorted him to their prison bus.
</P>
<P>
   On the street, pedestrians quickly recognized the arrest for
what it was and began to applaud. Then a taxi driver started
chanting, pumping his fist out the window of his van: ``Go home!''
he shouted. ``Go home!'' Soon it was a full-fledged chorus, loud
enough to drown out the screech of the rusting bus door closing
behind the prisoner _ the ninth to be collected on a recent
morning.
</P>
<P>
   Drawn to President Nelson Mandela's new democracy and an economy
that dwarfs all others on this continent, illegal immigrants from
all over Africa, many of them destitute, are pouring into this
country in ever greater numbers, experts say. But they are hardly
finding a welcome mat.
</P>
<P>
   The economy here is failing to grow as fast as predicted, and
majority rule has failed to produce enough housing, health clinics
and good schools. So South Africans are growing increasingly
resentful of the new arrivals, seeing them as thieves of scarce
resources.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the apartheid-era efforts to keep the country's borders
secure have been relaxed. But current hardship and past isolation
have left the country ill prepared to deal with this growing
problem. Surveys suggest that anti-foreigner attitudes,
particularly against blacks, are deep-seated and widespread among
all races. And violence against immigrants is growing.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, an angry mob killed three foreigners on a commuter
train outside Pretoria after accusing them of stealing jobs from
South Africans. Two of the victims, both from Senegal, were
electrocuted when they climbed onto the roof to escape being lashed
with cattle whips. The third, a Mozambican, was thrown out the
window and killed by an oncoming train.
</P>
<P>
   The incident was hardly the only recent brutality against
foreigners. In Cape Town, at least 10 died in the last year in
assaults that the police believe were related to anti-immigrant
sentiments. In downtown Johannesburg, local hawkers have repeatedly
demonstrated against foreign ones, and each time some foreigners
have been beaten and robbed.
</P>
<P>
   In Alexandra township, inside the wealthy suburb of Sandton,
armed gangs have assaulted immigrants and marched them to the
police station to ``clean'' the area of foreigners. And in the
eastern province of Mpumalanga last summer, a gang calling itself
the Unemployed Group ambushed and burned at least six trucks as
part of what it called a ``torch campaign'' to force companies to
give jobs to locals.
</P>
<P>
   Concerned about the pattern, the Human Rights Commission has
just sponsored a symposium to get business and community leaders
thinking about the issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even with the Pretoria train attack, the reaction was very
muted,'' said Jody Kollapen, a commission member who describes
animosity toward immigrants as having risen sharply in the last
five years. ``There was very little public outcry. That silence is
of great concern to us.''
</P>
<P>
   Recent surveys show that South Africans are among the world's
most xenophobic people. Twenty-five percent want a ban on
immigrants, according to one survey, taken last year by the
Institute for Democracy in South Africa, a nonprofit research
institute based in Cape Town. Just two years earlier that number
was 16 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The same survey found that about 80 percent of those polled said
they had little or no contact with foreigners.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, both black and white South Africans prefer white
immigrants, viewing newcomers from Europe and North America more
favorably than they do Africans. There is a debate about what may
be behind such attitudes. One of the authors of the institute's
survey, Dr. Robert Mattes, says he thinks the intolerance for other
Africans may have grown out of a society that for decades carefully
separated races and encouraged the denigration of blacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a very paternalistic and antagonistic view of blacks
north of the border,'' Mattes said. ``They are seen as wetbacks,
yokels, rural folks. They are definitely not like us.''
</P>
<P>
   But others argue that the xenophobia may simply be a passing
mood in a country that is forging a new national identity and
coping with difficult economic times.
</P>
<P>
   White-ruled South Africa strictly controlled the number of
immigrants allowed in as cheap labor. Borders were patrolled and
mined. An electric fence _ its voltage set to kill _ stood between
South Africa and Mozambique.
</P>
<P>
   But such restrictions have eased under the government of the
African National Congress, which in many ways owes its very
existence to its neighbors. Many exiled ANC leaders sat out the
apartheid era or plotted their guerrilla attacks in neighboring
countries that risked the vengeance of an often-brutal apartheid
government.
</P>
<P>
   Estimates of the illegal immigrant population in South Africa
now vary widely, from 2 million to 8 million, and are regarded by
most experts as hardly more than guesses. What is clear, however,
is that South Africa _ which according to the latest census figures
has a population of 37 million _ has been deporting more and more
immigrants each year, nearly 200,000 in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   For much of the continent, South Africa is the pot of gold at
its end, and each new war or famine triggers a wave of new arrivals
desperate to work on farms or building sites for a pittance, or
even for a daily bowl of porridge. Many end up at the lowest rungs
of the economy and live clustered together, creating their own
neighborhoods.

</P>
<P>
   The biggest influx comes from Mozambique, which has been ravaged
by nearly 20 years of civil war. The Kruger Park forms most of the
border between the two countries, and every year an unknown number
of the thousands of Mozambicans trying to cross are eaten by lions
_ which then must be hunted down and shot because they have
developed a taste for human flesh. Last year, during an autopsy of
one lion, a purse with $1.50 in Mozambican currency was found in
its stomach.
</P>
<P>
   South of the park, about 40 miles of electric fence still
stands. The voltage is now set to give only a strong shock.
Soldiers monitor computers that sound alarms whenever it is
breached, and they take up the chase. Many immigrants slip through
by running into the sugar-cane fields, emerging on roads where they
catch minivan taxis to carry them away quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Last year the Army Group 33, which patrols near Komatipoort,
arrested about 22,000 border-jumpers. It keeps them overnight in a
large holding cell on its base, gives them breakfast and takes them
back to Mozambique. But officials say most simply try again the
next day, which makes it difficult to keep up the soldiers' morale.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think when you catch the same guy three times in four days,
it can get pretty frustrating,'' said Capt. Gustav Brink, who is in
charge of one of the units that patrol the fence.
</P>
<P>
   One day earlier this year, Marcos Toal, 17, who had been caught
within seconds of sliding under the fence on his stomach, was in
the ``cage'' waiting to be taken back across the border.
</P>
<P>
   This, his first attempt, had ended badly. He had started with a
change of clothes and $30 _ enough, he hoped, to reach ``Egoli,''
the city of gold, also known as Johannesburg. But he had been
robbed on the Mozambican side by men demanding payment as guides
through the fence.
</P>
<P>
   Though he was clearly frightened that he would be beaten, he was
sure he would be trying again. South Africa is his only hope of
making enough money to marry and get started in life.
</P>
<P>
   ``People speak of South Africa and they say it is a place where
you can get work and make a living without having to turn to
crime,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1994 South Africa has been drafting a policy to admit
immigrants who have sought-after skills. Officials also realize
that the country's neighbors need investment, too, to keep their
citizens at home. But none of this stops politicians from routinely
using foreigners as scapegoats for everything from rising crime to
unemployment to AIDS, and the government has taken no step to
address the popular hostility.
</P>
<P>
   In a report released this year, Human Rights Watch condemned
South Africa's xenophobia and documented abuses of immigrants,
including beatings, extortion by the police and arbitrary arrests.
Both legal immigrants and South Africans are the targets of these
abuses, especially if they have very dark skins or inoculation
marks on their forearms. Most local people have these marks on
their upper arms.
</P>
<P>
   Foreigners, too, say they feel growing xenophobia, according to
a new report by the Center for Policy Studies, a research group
based in Johannesburg.
</P>
<P>
   Ade Ogunrinade, a Nigerian who is the deputy vice chancellor of
the Witwatersrand University here, was quoted in a recent newspaper
article as saying that his wife had had difficulty finding a job
and that they had both felt hostility because they are foreigners.
``In West Africa we have a tradition of warmth to foreigners,''
Ogunrinade said. ``I find it disconcerting that the same warmth is
not experienced here.''
</P>
<P>
   Peter Takirambudde, executive director of the Africa Division of
Human Rights Watch, took South Africans to task for a lack of
compassion. ``During the apartheid era,'' he said, ``many African
countries opened their doors to South African migrants, exiles and
refugees and paid a heavy economic price for their opposition to
apartheid. Now that the tables are turned, it is shameful to see
how hostile South Africans have become.''
</P>
<P>
   Authorities refused requests to visit Lindela, the holding
installation for immigrants in the Johannesburg area. But when the
young downtown salesman was taken there, a brief glimpse was
possible. An official interviewing new arrivals could be seen
repeatedly striking a young man, apparently unsatisfied with his
answers.
</P>
<P>
   Police officers working for the Johannesburg police units
tracking down illegal immigrants said arrests can be almost
laughably easy. Sometimes the police simply send a van to a certain
corner pretending that it is a taxi, and immigrants climb in.
</P>
<P>
   Some would-be immigrants have intricate schemes for getting
false papers, including paying tribal chiefs in rural areas to make
false certifications of who their parents are. But many cannot
afford papers, and so barely eke out an existence, because they are
taken advantage of by unscrupulous employers and landlords.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody looks at South Africa and sees it as the land of
milk and honey,'' said Superintendent Montiers Stein, who runs one
of the units. ``But it doesn't turn out that way for a lot of
them.''

`KILLER JOE': COMPELLINGLY WATCHABLE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Texas, Ill., N.Y.)  (EDS: Production notes appear at the end of the review.) 
(jw) 
 By BEN BRANTLEY    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A lot of beer, a little reefer, a whole lot of
television: as a steady diet, these ingredients don't exactly
sharpen the powers of concentration. And for the mush-minded
Smiths, the homicidal, trashy Texas family in ``Killer Joe,'' Tracy
Letts' terrifically tasty potboiler at the SoHo Playhouse, focus
mostly means getting a better picture on the tube.
</P>
<P>
   Why, even consideration of the contract killing of a close
personal relation and the contemplation of homemade pornographic
photos take a back seat to whatever might be flitting across the
small screen. Dad, poised to smash up some furniture after a nasty
argument with Mom, finds that he just can't be bothered once he
notices a rerun of ``Cannon,'' the series about the fat detective,
is on. Tempers may run short in the family, but attention spans are
even shorter.
</P>
<P>
   Audiences for ``Killer Joe,'' which opened Sunday night in a
pulsing new incarnation starring Scott Glenn and Amanda Plummer,
are unlikely to suffer from any similar affliction, even when the
characters onstage are at their fuzziest. Surely directed by Wilson
Milam, the show is compellingly watchable, a pungent reminder that
characters in the theater don't have to be poetic or even
passionate to hold your interest.
</P>
<P>
   Letts' play, his first, isn't brand new. Since 1993, Milam has
staged it in Chicago, New York (for the 29th Street Rep, a
co-producer here), Edinburgh and London. I didn't see any of the
earlier versions, but this one has the seamlessness and authority
that a long incubation can provide. Life may be sloppy and squalid
in ``Killer Joe,'' but it is presented with surgical precision.
</P>
<P>
   The material could easily register as white-trash Gothic with a
comic-book spin, a sort of ``Tobacco Road'' according to Wes
Craven. Yet while ``Killer Joe'' is often deeply funny, it is cheap
in neither its humor nor its shock effects, some of which run to
the X-rated.
</P>
<P>
   This is partly because Letts' Texas trailer-park dialogue sounds
so natural, only occasionally straining for effect, and partly
because the production's five actors make such an unconditional
commitment to their parts, refusing to signal that they are smarter
than the people they're playing.
</P>
<P>
   And although the characters seldom invite your sympathy in any
traditional way, you are utterly engaged by them. ``Killer Joe''
has the enjoyable hairpin turns of the standard mystery thriller,
but it's the skewed, shifting relationships that keep you hooked.
</P>
<P>
   Mind you, Letts isn't serving two-ton moral themes. ``Killer
Joe'' is no sign-waving study in the banality of evil or even the
evil of banality. But it does present a portrait of a purely
American world that is so numbed out that carnage fits comfortably
into the everyday domestic landscape. It's a hazy environment in
which violence on television and violence in life have bled into a
single, continuing drone.
</P>
<P>
   When the 20-year-old Dottie Smith (Sarah Paulson) meets the
play's title character (Glenn), a detective who moonlights as a
contract killer, she makes the association with Mannix, a private
eye on television, while observing, ``He's not real.'' ``No, I'm
real,'' Joe responds. Among the characters of ``Killer Joe,'' such
distinctions are necessary.
</P>
<P>
   Set in the cheesy trailer shared by Ansel Smith (Marc A. Nelson)
with his racy wife, Sharla (Ms. Plummer), and his daughter, Dottie,
the plot spins on the planned murder of a character who is never
seen. That's Adele, the ex-wife of Ansel and the mother of Dottie
and Chris (Mike Shannon), an inefficient drug pusher who is
seriously in debt to the wrong kind of people. Chris proposes to
his father that Adele, who has a tempting life insurance policy, be
exterminated by someone who knows exactly how to handle such
things.
</P>
<P>
   Enter Killer Joe Cooper, who is everything the Smiths are not:
polite, tidy and able to pursue a course of action from beginning
to end. Joe's style clashes with that of his clients from their
first meeting, a scene executed with the canny, deadpan casualness
that is the production's dominant tone. (``We've never done
anything like this before,'' Chris mumbles. ``We don't want to do
it, but it's got to be done.'')
</P>
<P>
   The Smiths don't even have the money for a down payment. Joe,
however, is willing to take a retainer in the form of the virginal
Dottie, who wants to be a model like Christie Brinkley and has a
habit of walking in her sleep. It says a lot about ``Killer Joe''
that it is hard to distinguish innocence from anesthesia.
</P>
<P>
   That there's more to killing Adele than meets the bleary eye
consumes nearly two and a half hours, with ancillary events ranging
from a brutal revelation of a double-cross to a first-act
conclusion that is one of the sickest (and, admit it, sexiest)
seduction scenes ever. Joe finally blows his cool before the play
ends. The production itself never does, yet it still manages to
exert the addictive pull of a classic thriller.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Achieving that feeling onstage has rarely been carried off in
recent years. (Think of the unholy mess that was made of the
revival of ``Wait Until Dark.'') In fact, despite surface
similarities to Sam Shepard's family dramas, ``Killer Joe'' most
directly invites comparison with movies: the droll,
Southern-cracker variations on film noir, like the Coen brothers'
``Blood Simple.''
</P>
<P>
   The show is nonetheless expressly theatrical. It makes
tantalizing use of the sense of people existing in real time; it's
not afraid to go slow in crucial moments. And it ruthlessly
exploits the sensory immediacy the stage allows.
</P>
<P>
   You're always aware of the fleshy contingency of those people in
the trailer (designed with dead-on detail, right down to the
undersized antlers over the door, by George Xenos). Watch the
girthful Nelson blotting sweat from his nearly naked body with
paper towels, or the way Ms. Plummer's Sharla keeps spraying her
legs with perfume, a process her husband likens to ``fumigating the
gates of hell.''
</P>
<P>
   This ripe physicality is carried out on every level: the wry use
of classic Grand Guignol sound effects, like thunderclaps and
barking dogs, supplied by Hired Gun/One Dream; Greg MacPherson's
lurid lighting, which makes especially effective use of the glows
cast by an open refrigerator door and a television screen; Jana
Stauffer's tatty costumes, which range from Ansel's distended
jockey shorts to the black sequined mini-dress that Sharla
considers appropriate for a funeral. (Ms. Plummer wears both to
stunning effect.)
</P>
<P>
   To the cast's credit, no single actor stands out. They're all
first rate. As the mixed-up, verbally meandering Chris, Shannon
takes Method mumbling to an exceptionally high level, while Nelson
memorably finds the vague little coward inside his bulky frame.
</P>
<P>
   Even at her most robotic, Ms. Paulson's Dottie exudes a troubled
sensuality that justifies Joe's attentions to her, and Ms. Plummer
deliciously (and surprisingly) underplays a foxy character who
isn't nearly as clever as she think she is. Glenn is the very model
of the assassin next door, and he never succumbs to the temptation
to go for the obviously sinister.
</P>
<P>
   There is, for the record, full frontal nudity and plenty of
grisly violence. The latter is definitely disturbing, but mostly
because it mixes so naturally into the ordinary flow of events. A
lot of the activity in ``Killer Joe'' is of a sort usually
associated with fiery passions; that the characters here run
emotional temperatures below normal is exactly, if perversely, what
keeps you enthralled.

 &HT;    The Falcons won't be undersold
 &HT;    By Mark Bradley
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ To answer the dreaded question: Yes, the Falcons can
win without Chris Chandler. No, not for long. Maybe not even for a
whole game. But over two-plus quarters of a fearsomely competitive
game? They can do it. They just did it.
</P>
<P>
   For long moments Sunday, losing seemed easier than winning.
Chandler was gone, his left shoulder hurt. Energized by the sight
of the fossilized Falcon Steve DeBerg, the Saints were closing in.
A safety _ DeBerg blew a handoff _ cut the lead to a point with 25
minutes to go. And during those 25 minutes the Falcons not only
parried the Saints but outscored them 14-7.
</P>
<P>
   Said Dan Reeves: ``Our defense decided that if we didn't let
them score, they couldn't win.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, the Falcons D went further still. Said safety Eugene
Robinson: ``We said in the huddle, 'We've got to score
ourselves.'''
</P>
<P>
   On that very play, Robinson did. He intercepted Billy Joe
Tolliver's pass and returned it 25 yards for the killing touchdown.
The Falcons had gone two-plus quarters without the precious
Chandler and emerged 5-1. Every time you feel you've gotten a read
on their capabilities, the Falcons do something to make you believe
you've undersold them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We bounce back,'' Chuck Smith said. ``That's the difference in
this team now -- we fight back. If something goes against us, we're
still accountable for the next series. We can't just let somebody
run the table on us.''
</P>
<P>
   Until Sunday, the scoop on the Falcons was that they couldn't
win a game Chandler didn't finish. (Empirical evidence supported
this: Before Sunday, they hadn't.) But DeBerg made enough deft
plays against New Orleans to indicate that Reeves wasn't utterly
loopy for signing him after a four-year playing hiatus.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody knows Chris is an integral part of our offense,''
said defensive end Lester Archambeau. And yet, unlike the
unlamented run-and-shoot, this offense doesn't put the whole weight
on the quarterback. Archambeau again: ``You could see the whole
offensive unit pick it up.''
</P>
<P>
   The line blocked harder. Jamal Anderson ran more powerfully.
Said fullback Bob Christian: ``We faltered at first, but the
defense really came through. And then we relaxed. It wasn't like we
had to do anything we hadn't practiced.''
</P>
<P>
   Surely, though, no workout has simulated the oomph that enabled
Christian to fight off four defenders to score a vital touchdown,
that drove the smallish Smith to six solo tackles against the
All-Pro blocker William Roaf. ``The best game against the run I've
ever had,'' Smith said. ``They put the big dog on me, but this
medium-sized dog kept fighting.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Christian: ``It's amazing what you can do when you've got
the desire.''
</P>
<P>
   So maybe Chandler misses next week's game, and maybe the Falcons
lose to the Jets. In the grand scheme, that's less important than
what the Falcons learned about themselves Sunday: That this is no
one-man operation, and that these are no sunshine soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Forget the past,'' Cornelius Bennett said. ``It's all new.
We're the Dirty Birds now. We've almost rounded that corner. .
.Come January, we're going to have a (playoff) game here.''

 &HT;    A look back at what has transpired
 &HT;    By Tony Barnhart
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ They don't give awards for one-half season's work, but
if they did, these would be my nominees:
</P>
<P>
   Best game: Until Saturday, it was a tie between Georgia's 28-27
win over LSU and Tennessee's 34-33 win at Syracuse. But Georgia
Tech's 41-38 win over No. 7 Virginia, when the Yellow Jackets
rallied from 21 points down, takes the prize.
</P>
<P>
   Best player: Texas running back Ricky Williams had this week
off, but he is headed for immortality. Through six games Williams
has 1,225 yards and 22 touchdowns. Barring injury, he will be the
NCAA's all-time leading rusher at the end of this season.
</P>
<P>
   Best coach: Arkansas was picked to finish last in the SEC West.
Today the Hogs are 6-0 and No. 15 in the AP poll and No. 12 in the
coaches poll. Houston Nutt obviously did something right. Now let's
see how it goes in the second half with a schedule that includes
Auburn, Mississippi, Tennessee, Mississippi State, and LSU.
</P>
<P>
   Biggest disappointment: North Carolina was No. 11 in the
preseason. That was too high, given the personnel losses, which
included a ton of NFL draft picks and the coach. But there is no
way the Tar Heels should be 2-3. Doesn't matter. Basketball
practice started last week.
</P>
<P>
   Most overrated: LSU, 3-3 and out of the Top 25 after starting
the season in everybody's Top 10. After Saturday night's 39-36 loss
to Kentucky, it must be apparent to everybody that Lou Tepper ain't
getting it done as defensive coordinator.
</P>
<P>
   Most underrated: Texas A&AMP;M is 6-0 since losing to Florida State
in the Kickoff Classic. The Aggies have beaten Nebraska and will
probably face Kansas State in the Big 12 championship game. They
play great defense.
</P>
<P>
   Coach most likely to be moving (his choice): Tommy Bowden of No.
22 Tulane (5-0) who will have his pick of jobs at the end of the
season.
</P>
<P>
   Coach most likely to be moving (somebody else's choice): South
Carolina's Brad Scott, although the scribes in the Palmetto State
insist he'll get one more year from AD Mike McGee.
</P>
<P>
   Just thinking
</P>
<P>
   Not that the coaches don't put a lot of thought into it, but why
does their poll rank Kansas State, at No. 3, ahead of Tennessee?
Kansas State has played the worst non-conference schedule in
history: Indiana State (3-3), Northern Illinois, (1-5) and
Northeast Louisiana (2-4). The Wildcats have beaten one ranked
team, No. 17 Colorado, 16-9. Tennessee has beaten No. 21 Syracuse
on the road, No. 11 Georgia on the road and No. 5 Florida at home.
The AP poll of writers and broadcasters recognizes this and has the
Volunteers No. 3.
</P>
<P>
   Has there ever been a time when Auburn's Terry Bowden needed to
win a ball game more than Saturday's meeting with Louisiana Tech?
The Tigers are 1-5 and getting worse, not better. There are rumors
starting to come out of the state that Bowden is in trouble but I
don't buy it. Besides, the powers that be would have to take out a
second mortgage on Jordan-Hare Stadium to pay off Bowden's
seven-year contract.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA has invested a lot of emotional energy in the last two wins
over Arizona and Oregon, which it beat 41-38 in overtime Saturday.
The Bruins could be ripe for a stumble when they travel to
surprising California on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Worth noting
</P>
<P>
   Florida coach Steve Spurrier actually said this after Saturday's
24-3 win over Auburn: ``My job is to win games, not run up a bunch
of statistics,'' said Spurrier. My how times have changed.
Actually, Spurrier was just playing it smart against a team he knew
would never score on his defense, even if they played for three
days.
</P>
<P>
   Here's an early stat that should concern you Georgia Tech fans
as No. 6 Florida State comes to town. After struggling early in the
season, Seminole quarterback Chris Weinke has thrown 149
consecutive passes without an interception. After beating Clemson
48-0, the Florida State offense may be rounding into shape in time
for Saturday night's game on ESPN.
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee coach Phillip Fulmer will be reminding his team this
week that the 1992 Volunteer squad also started 5-0. Then they fell
off the face of the earth with consecutive losses to Arkansas,
Alabama, and South Carolina. It's the fourth Saturday in October,
but Alabama will be in Knoxville. The Crimson Tide has spoiled a
lot of Big Orange dreams.
</P>
<P>
   Kramer at TD Club
</P>
<P>
   SEC Commissioner Roy Kramer will be the featured speaker at
today's meeting of the Atlanta Touchdown Club, set for the Galleria
Centre. Lunch begins at noon, followed by remarks from Kramer. For
more information call 770-953-3200.

 &HT;    Fans, team find it too early to sweep Georgia Tech win under rug
 &HT;    By Carroll Rogers
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Sunday morning found Georgia Tech's campus scattered
with evidence of something special _ remnants of yellow pom-poms
strewn on the ground, floats still standing intact in front of
sorority and fraternity houses, tents with tables and chairs long
abandoned by Tech alumni and fans, and a curious void behind both
end zones at Bobby Dodd Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   This particular post-homecoming mess was worth keeping around
for a while. No Tech fan wanted to sweep the memory of Saturday's
improbable come-from-behind 41-38 win over Virginia under a rug
just yet. The only tricky part of the homecoming hangover was those
missing goalposts, which Tech fans engineered down in a few seconds
and carried off the field after Tech's biggest victory since it won
by the same score at Virginia on the way to the UPI national
championship in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   When Tech coach George O'Leary got into his office Sunday
morning, the first call he got was from the president of a football
equipment manufacturing company, asking if he needed some goal
posts.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, the hassles of winning big.
</P>
<P>
   O'Leary gave him the number of Tech associate athletics director
Sterling Brown, whose task it is to get his hands on some new
goalposts and quick, since No. 6 Florida State is coming Saturday
for what now looks like the ACC championship game.
</P>
<P>
   No. 20 Tech (5-1, 4-0) is the only team still undefeated in the
ACC and a win over Seminoles (6-1, 3-1) would all but secure its
first ACC title since 1990, assuming it could beat Clemson,
Maryland and Wake Forest. If FSU wins, Tech still has a shot at a
share. Things don't get complicated unless FSU beats both Tech and
Virginia, in which case there would be a three-way tie for first in
the ACC.
</P>
<P>
   The ACC has adopted a tiebreaking system based on head-to-head
</P>
<P>
   competition and rankings. If Tech, Florida State and Virginia
are all tied with 7-1 records, the highest-ranked team would get
the first bid.
</P>
<P>
   O'Leary, though, has turned his attention to getting this team
ready for a high-powered Seminole offense.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm glad we're playing Florida State now,'' O'Leary said.
``We'll catch
</P>
<P>
   the kids' attention real quick.''
</P>
<P>
   They'll need quarterback Joe Hamilton healthy to do it, and
expect to
</P>
<P>
   have him ready. Hamilton sprained his medial collateral ligament
during the second quarter on Saturday but was able to fight through
the pain and play.
</P>
<P>
   While he looked pretty mobile when he dropped back to pass,
Hamilton admitted after the game he had little confidence in his
ability to run. O'Leary said he may rest him in the early part of
the week, but Tech expects to have him for Florida State on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   As for Tech's defense, those eye-popping 600 yards the Yellow
Jackets gave up on defense come into focus this week as they look
for ways to play for four quarters like they did late against
Virginia.

 &HT;    Impact of killings on tourism may depend on circumstances
 &HT;    WITH HOTEL-SHOOTING
 &HT;    By Alfred Charles
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ In the wake of a triple slaying at an upscale downtown
hotel, city leaders and tourism officials are wondering what the
killings will mean for Atlanta's lucrative tourism and convention
business.
</P>
<P>
   But the officials who spoke Sunday said the impact on the city's
hotel business largely will depend on the circumstances of the
killings _ whether it was a random attack on conventioneers or a
dispute between acquaintances that turned deadly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anything that casts a negative shadow on the city is a
concern,'' said Bill Howard, vice president for public relations
and tourism at the Atlanta Convention and Visitors Bureau. ``But we
are not sure whether the victims were visitors to our city or
people involved in illegal activity.''
</P>
<P>
   Police have said little publicly about the execution-style
slayings that occurred on the 24th floor of the Atlanta Hilton &AMP;
Towers. Police have said only that a maid discovered the bodies of
three men, who had each been shot in the head.
</P>
<P>
   With so few facts in the public domain, city officials said the
public and would-be guests at downtown Atlanta hotels should not
rush to judgement before all the facts about the killings are
known.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is unfortunate if people jump to the conclusion that this a
trend or the city is unsafe,'' said Jabari Simama, spokesman for
Mayor Bill Campbell. ``Downtown is safe.''
</P>
<P>
   The three killings occurred on the last day of a special
promotion called the Atlanta Homecoming Weekend that was sponsored
by the convention and visitors bureau. The effort provided
discounts to local residents who stayed at downtown hotels.
</P>
<P>
   Spurgeon Richardson, president of the visitors bureau, said
tourism business likely won't be affected if the victims were
involved in illegal behavior such as drug-dealing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Meeting planners understand that while it's unfortunate,
drug-related crime can happen anywhere in the country,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Other convention officials said if the attack does turn out to
be a deadly assault on convention-goers, they would work with the
city to protect Atlanta's tourism business.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would do whatever we could to fix the cause,'' Howard said.
</P>
<P>
   Convention officials said there has been little reported
violence against visitors who come to Atlanta on business and stay
in central business district hotels.
</P>
<P>
   Four months ago, police said crime in Zone 5, which includes
downtown, dropped 23 percent in 1997 and continued to decline this
year. Downtown has just four fewer police officers patrolling the
streets than in 1995, authorities said this summer.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, a study commissioned by the Convention and Visitors
Bureau showed that the perception of crime in Atlanta was one of
the biggest problems facing the city while trying to lure
convention and trade shows - and the guests who will fill downtown
hotel rooms.
</P>
<P>
   Such shows pump millions of dollars every year into Atlanta's
economy.

 &HT;    Falcons reach back and call on an old relic of their own
 &HT;    By Furman Bisher
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ They came together in Georgia Dome Sunday afternoon
and gave us an interesting study in the world of quarterbacking,
though that was not the purpose of it all. The purpose was to see
if the Falcons, of the local precinct, could lay another one on the
New Orleans Saints, or vice versa. As it turned out, vice versa
came in second.
</P>
<P>
   Down through the tunnel of time, New Orleans has become the
Halfway House for NFL quarterbacks. A stream of lads with a hope
and oldtimers trying to stretch out careers have passed through
Saints uniforms. Steve Walsh, Wade Wilson, Jim Everett, then Heath
Shuler, and this year is no exception, beginning with Billy Joe
Holbert, who was injured, followed by Danny Wuerffel, then the
latest in couch cases, Kerry Collins, who didn't have the heart for
it in Charlotte.
</P>
<P>
   Who should show up Sunday, with a fleur de lis on his hat but
the old Texas redhead, Billy (Available) Joe Tolliver. He was
sitting at home a month ago, coaching his kid's team, when the
telephone rang, and it was Mike Ditka. When Billy Joe was a Falcon,
it was the consensus that you'd have more confidence in him if he
had a 2-iron in hand. Ditka wanted him because he's ``Iron Mike's''
kind, tough and tough.
</P>
<P>
   By the time night fell, as well as one can tell from inside the
big tent, the Falcons had reached back into their collection of
keepsakes and called on an old relic of their own. The fear
resident in all our hearts had come to pass, that Chris Chandler
might come down wounded and take the season with him. In the second
quarter, a linebacker named Mark Fields piled into Chandler with
malice in his heart and the result was, the Falcon quarterback was
gone, badly bruised shoulder and ribs.
</P>
<P>
   Enter Steve DeBerg, who will be 45 years old in January, and who
hadn't thrown a pass in the league since December, five years ago.
Now the combined age of the two quarterbacks on the field was 75.
It had the ring of an oldtimers game. But say this, Tolliver looked
as much at home as with his 2-iron, and DeBerg looked as though he
hadn't missed a beat. It was an intriguing match of ``The Redheaded
Quarterback'' and ``The Rocking Chair Quarterback.'' In honor of
the occasion, even ``the wave'' was revived by the rejuvenated,
re-inspired fans.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were great,'' Dan Reeves said, ``but I wish they'd learn
to time the wave to when the Saints have the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   The Saints were backed up by their usual shipload of ``Who
Dats,'' who came across loud and clear. Their effect is kind of
lost in the big old barn, not nearly the presence they were in the
old open-air stadium. They stood by their man Tolliver, and for a
guy who had been in mothballs a spell himself, he kept the Saints
in the game. He got off a couple of bombs to Keith Poole, out of
Arizona State, and completed 14 out of 29 passes for 261 yards.
</P>
<P>
   It was the longest time before DeBerg was able to move the
chains, but once he found the right gear, he also found the end
zone, on an 8-yard pass to Bob Christian in the fourth quarter. As
it turned out, if the Braves had had the Falcons kind of bullpen,
they'd be in the World Series today.
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons won, 31-23, and the record is now 5-1. Once before,
in Dan Henning's last year, they got away to a 4-0 start, including
a winning date with Dallas, but won only three more games the rest
of the season. When Mike Ditka was here the last time, he was so
furious he threatened to retire. He had reason again, and left no
doubt about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not happy with this at all,'' he said. ``They were tougher
than us. They smacked us in the mouth. It's a lack of discipline.''
All of this after he and Reeves, old teammates at Dallas, had
embraced at midfield.
</P>
<P>
   It bears saying, though, that after all the twilight excitement
at Bobby Dodd-Grant Field Saturday, as Georgia Tech beat Virginia
in a game for the museum, this one was sort of like swearing off.
It was tame stuff, back to the predictable routine of the pro game.

 &HT;    Gordon edges closer Winston Cup
 &HT;    By Tom McCollister
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. _ Jeff Gordon finally won a race in the
month of October on Saturday night, slaying those conservative
demons and leaving him within reach of securing his third Winston
Cup points championship.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon's victory at Daytona International Speedway was as
spectacular as the new 1,835 light fixtures that provided light for
the track and the capacity crowd.
</P>
<P>
   With the victory, the 27-year-old Gordon leads runnerup Mark
Martin, who finished 16th, by 358 points. All Gordon needs to claim
the title is to finish 32nd or better in the final three events, or
gain 18 points on Martin this week at Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   ``What keeps me going? There's always something left to
accomplish,'' Gordon said of his 11 victories and 17 top-five
finishes. ``What drives me is competition, driving into Victory
Lane. It doesn't matter what race it is. I don't look at the
records. I like challenging for the wins. We haven't won at every
track on the circuit.''
</P>
<P>
   Gordon put victory No. 11 in the books the hard way. Following a
36-minute red flag rain delay, Gordon made the track as narrow as
possible for those who ran at him during the final laps. He locked
onto his rear view mirror and blocked every move by charging Bobby
Labonte for his 40th career victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw Bobby coming on with a head of steam and said, 'Man,
I've got to block him,''' said Gordon, who led only 49 laps,
including the final 38. ``It was an awesome race. It wasn't the
Fourth of July, but there were a lot of fireworks out there.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody wanted to see race end under caution. It's tough to be
a driver and know what you go through out there with a three-lap
shootout. It's hard to be in favor of that. It's more dangerous.
It's a double-edge sword. But the fans make the sport. Thankfully,
there were no serious injuries.''
</P>
<P>
   There were six cautions for 26 laps and 16 lead changes among
nine drivers. The most serious injury was a fractured shoulder
blade, suffered by Kevin Lepage when he hit the wall in turn two
and began a 12-car crash.
</P>
<P>
   Dale Jarrett, who led 38 laps early, had a tire go down and
finished 23rd; and Dale Earnhardt, who ran through Bobby Labonte's
pit, pushed a tire down pit road and damaged the aerodynamics. He
finished 10th.
</P>
<P>
   ``We finally won a race in October,'' Gordon said. ``We wanted
to be little bit stronger in the latter part of the year. Maybe we
approached it too conservatively, but we couldn't be conservative
because Mark was running so strong. This gives us the opportunity
to go to Phoenix and run real strong there.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Around the packed back room of a suburban Boston bar
one recent evening, dozens of rain-sodden campaigners summoned the
energy for one last refrain. To the tune of the pop chestnut ``King
of the Road,'' they chorused:
</P>
<P>
   ``Government for sale or rent;
</P>
<P>
   ``Billionaires for president.''
</P>
<P>
   And then they cheered: ``Yes on Two!''
</P>
<P>
   ``Two'' _ that is, Question Two, better known as the ``Clean
Elections Initiative'' _ is the Massachusetts version of a proposal
for sweeping campaign finance reform that is on next month's
ballot. In Arizona, the shout would have been, ``Yes on Proposition
200!''
</P>
<P>
   The two very disparate states, Massachusetts so liberal and
Arizona so conservative, have become the principal battlegrounds
this fall for the struggle over campaign finance reform.
</P>
<P>
   Stymied on the federal level by Senate opposition earlier this
year, the push for cleaner campaigning has moved, for now, to the
states. And it appears to be gaining ground, with showdowns
expected next in Missouri, Washington and Oregon.
</P>
<P>
   In Massachusetts and Arizona, broad coalitions of groups ranging
from the League of Women Voters to unions and the watchdog group
Common Cause are using ballot initiatives to push a dramatic
version of state-level reform known to campaign finance experts as
``full public financing,'' and to supporters as ``clean money.''
</P>
<P>
   The basic concept calls for replacing private campaign money
with public money, thus freeing candidates from potentially
corrupting obligations to lobbyists and special interests. It
offers candidates for state office this incentive: If, after an
initial spurt of small-donation gathering to qualify, they renounce
all fund-raising, they will get enough public money for a moderate
campaign budget.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents question whether taxpayers really want to spend
millions of dollars to finance scores or hundreds of campaigns. But
according to polls released in both states in the last week, the
public financing initiatives have a strong chance of passing.
</P>
<P>
   Anthony Corrado, a professor of government at Colby College and
a campaign finance specialist, calls the two initiatives the most
progressive and comprehensive efforts at such reform under way in
the country. They go far beyond the partial public financing and
matching funds common in many states, he said, and try to take
virtually all the private money out of state politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``This approach to reform is a bold experiment,'' Corrado said,
``and it has enjoyed remarkable success for such a nascent
effort.''
</P>
<P>
   Corrado said the reform ``flies in the face of everything we
hear out of Washington these days _ that the public doesn't want to
pay for campaigns, that they don't want tax dollars used for
elections.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And instead,'' he said, ``what we are finding is that there is
substantial support among the public for meaningful reform.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, polls have found that voters nationwide think the
campaign finance system needs major reform.
</P>
<P>
   But Stephen Roop, treasurer of the group now forming to oppose
the Massachusetts initiative, said he expected to marshal many
fellow opponents among ``people who find out what the proponents
don't talk about very much, which is the cost: $56 million every
four years out of one's taxes.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is no longer a voluntary system such as we have now,''
Roop said. ``This is a forced contribution to every candidate who
makes the ballot.''
</P>
<P>
   The public money to pay for the campaigns in Massachusetts would
come in part from taxpayers who voluntarily checked off a special
box on their income-tax returns and from appropriations by the
Legislature.
</P>
<P>
   The measure's supporters respond that the initiative limits
public campaign money to one-tenth of 1 percent of the state
budget, or about $4 per year per taxpayer.
</P>
<P>
   In Arizona, ballot measure supporters said opponents cannot use
the expenditure of taxpayer money as an argument because the
initiative provided its own financing mechanism: It increases the
fee for lobbyists from $25 to $100, includes a voluntary tax
checkoff and imposes a 20 percent surcharge on civil and criminal
fines.
</P>
<P>
   For an early idea of how things actually work under a full
public financing system, the logical place to look is Maine.
</P>
<P>
   It was Maine, ever independent, that passed the first such
reform back in 1996, in a ballot initiative that gained 56 percent
of the vote. Last year, the Vermont Legislature passed a similar
measure.
</P>
<P>
   Neither of the new laws takes effect until the year 2000
elections. But initial indications of whether the plan can work can
be seen in Maine, where taxpayers on this year's income-tax returns
were given the option of checking a box that directs $3 to the
campaign fund.
</P>
<P>
   So far, about 16 percent of a half-million or so taxpayers _
about 80,000 people _ have checked the box, state officials say, a
relatively high percentage for a checkoff. And the checkoff is only
one of several sources for the election fund, they noted. The Maine
Legislature has passed the first $2 million annual appropriation
required to finance the new system.
</P>
<P>
   Maine and Vermont are also seen as testing grounds for legal
challenges to the financing measures, which are under way in both
states. Efforts to limit campaign spending risk running up against
the U.S. Supreme Court's Buckley vs. Valeo decision of 1976, which
decreed campaign donations a form of free expression protected by
the First Amendment.
</P>
<P>
   The public financing measures try to work around that decision
by keeping candidates' participation voluntary, said Ellen Miller,
executive director of Public Campaign, a nonpartisan group based in
Washington that advocates such laws and provided technical help to
the initiatives in Massachusetts and Arizona. In a way, she said,
the state initiatives are a way to work around the federal gridlock
on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a way of engaging citizens that could ultimately lead to
federal reform,'' she said. ``It's a way of piloting and testing
out a proposal that could ultimately make a difference.''
</P>
<P>
   After Massachusetts and Arizona, Ms. Miller said, the states
where the issue is likeliest to come to a vote next are Missouri,
Washington and Oregon, and possibly Michigan and Idaho.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   If such public financing proposals ever came to fruition in more
populous states where campaigns are much more expensive, the
amounts of money that had to be approved by voters, taxpayers and
lawmakers would presumably be far greater and the challenge to
advocates greater as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``The goal is for state activists to demonstrate the viability
of this proposal in the public's mind,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, this year's ``clean money'' campaigns are beginning
to heat up. David Donnelly, who managed the victorious Maine
campaign, is overseeing a Massachusetts effort that has already
brought together several thousand volunteers, scores of
endorsements and more than $900,000 in contributions. (He dismisses
suggestions of irony that a campaign to cap campaign spending has
raised so much; the difference, he says, is that the money buys no
one any special access.)
</P>
<P>
   Last Monday, the entire Massachusetts congressional delegation
endorsed the measure, issuing a statement that its passage would
``send a strong message to Washington that voters want an overhaul
of the system.'' And a poll published this month in The Boston
Globe found that 54 percent of respondents favored the initiative,
and 28 percent opposed it.
</P>
<P>
   Along with providing public financing, the Massachusetts
initiative would ban injections of national party money into the
state parties, a form of the loosely regulated donations known as
soft money, and would require that campaign finance disclosure
forms be filed electronically, so access would be available on the
Internet. If the measure is approved, Massachusetts would join
Connecticut and Alaska in banning such ``soft money'' injections.
</P>
<P>
   In Arizona, Kaia Lenhart, the political director of Arizonans
for Clean Elections, said the campaign had raised nearly half a
million dollars, attracted a couple of hundred volunteers and
gathered supporters ranging from the American Association of
Retired Persons to Susan Goldwater, widow of the former
presidential candidate, senator and conservative thinker, Barry
Goldwater.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign, in fact, uses a classic quotation from Goldwater:
``Senators and representatives,'' he said, ``weigh every decision
against the question `How will this affect my fund-raising
prospects?' rather than `How will this affect the national
interest?' ''
</P>
<P>
   A poll published last Sunday in The Arizona Republic showed 53
percent of respondents favored Proposition 200, while 14 percent
opposed it and 33 percent were undecided. A formal opposition
committee has yet to declare itself, Ms. Lenhart said, but is
expected to do so soon.
</P>
<P>
   Interest in Arizona for campaign finance reform appears to arise
in part from recent scandals in the state, notably ``Azscam'' in
1991, which featured police videotapes of legislators taking
packets of money from purported casino operators.
</P>
<P>
   Reform advocates say that if Massachusetts passes its elections
initiative, it will attract attention purely because of the state's
political heft. But passage in Arizona, said Lila Schwartz, the
state president of the League of Women Voters, would have special
impact.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think if it passes in Arizona, it can pass anywhere,'' she
said.

GIVE ESPN CREDIT FOR MAKING IT LOOK ATTRACTIVE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TOM HOFFARTH  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The idea sounded good at the time.
</P>
<P>
   Three years ago, ESPN, which was just beginning to discover that
it could put its label on anything that wasn't moving, started to
offer its own Master Card through MBNA America, a bank based in
Wilmington, Del.
</P>
<P>
   The hook was, the more you used the card, the more ``dream
points'' you accumulated. Earn one point for every dollar charged
on the card. Then cash in the points for prizes down the road. It's
a popular, 18.9 percent-proof scam. Perfectly legal.
</P>
<P>
   Well, ESPN card holders were informed recently that the ESPN
Rewards Program will expire on Oct. 31, 1999. No problem. The
one-year warning has been sounded.
</P>
<P>
   But the point is, if you're a card-carrying customer in Los
Angeles, racking up ``dream points'' is kind of pointless. Consider
these choices:
</P>
<P>
   __ 1,000 points: An autograph from Gale Sayers, Walt Frazier,
Bob Feller, Bernie Parent or Bill Barber.
</P>
<P>
   Great, if you're a native of Chicago, New York, Cleveland,
Philadelphia... and who the hell is Bill Barber?
</P>
<P>
   __ 5,000 points: Two tickets to one of 12 sporting events
between now and September '99. Stuff like a New Orleans Saints game
in November, a Charlotte Hornets game in January (better wait on
that one), an ATP Tour event in Key Biscayne, Fla., next March or
the '99 Preakness in Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   OK, but is travel included? Sure, if you use your card to buy
your own plane ticket. The closest event to pick is the PGA
International event in Las Vegas, which, by the way, ended Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   __ 7,500 points: Two choices: 1) A deluxe celebrity-hosted
private tour of ESPN's studio in Bristol, Conn., which includes a
night hotel stay, breakfast and dinner. Just pick one of nine
convenient dates. 2) A night at the ESPY Awards in New York City in
February '99.
</P>
<P>
   The downside: 1) no plane trip included and 2) no plane trip
included.
</P>
<P>
   __ 15,000 points: The grand prize, which can be easily had if
you put a new Chrysler LeBaron on the card, is a package _ hotel
accommodations, included _ for VIP access in the control room to
watch a taping of ``UpClose.'' And you get to meet Chris Myers
after the show!
</P>
<P>
   This time, they'll fly you there.
</P>
<P>
   And by the way, the show tapes in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   There's time left to order a card and run up a tab (call
1-800-847-7378 or apply online at www.webapply.com/espn). I really
shouldn't admit to how much damage I've incurred on the card over
the last three years.
</P>
<P>
   Put it this way: Trade you four Gale Sayers scribbles and two
tickets to a Detroit Tigers game for another Bob Feller autograph.

`BELOVED' APPEALS MAINLY IN BIG CITIES 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   HOLLYWOOD _ Movie audiences over the weekend responded
tentatively to ``Beloved,'' despite lavish promotion by its studio,
Walt Disney Co., and its star and producer, Oprah Winfrey.
</P>
<P>
   The story about the legacy of slavery, adapted from the Pulitzer
Prize-winning novel by Toni Morrison, seemed to play especially
well in cities like New York, Los Angeles, Detroit, Chicago and San
Francisco. The prime audience for the film, which opened with
weekend box-office sales of $8.5 million, appeared to be older
black women.
</P>
<P>
   ``It played strongly in sophisticated markets where the book did
well,'' said Marvin Antonowsky, a veteran film-marketing
consultant. ``It played weakly in middle America. It played very
well among black women who are 35-plus.''
</P>
<P>
   A rival studio's marketing executive, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, said: ``It's certainly strong in review-driven, upscale
theaters. It had strong support in the African-American community.
Where it didn't do well at all is at big suburban malls all over
the country, and you have to do well at those theaters.'' Several
other rival executives characterized the opening as disappointing.
</P>
<P>
   But Dick Cook, chairman of the Walt Disney Motion Picture Group,
disagreed. ``I'd characterize the opening as good,'' he said.
``This is not an exploitation movie. This is a serious movie. We've
seen tremendous critical acclaim. It'll take time to build,
especially in smaller towns.''
</P>
<P>
   The film opened fifth, behind ``Practical Magic,'' ``Bride of
Chucky,'' ``Antz'' and ``Rush Hour.'' But comparisons are a bit
unfair because ``Beloved'' opened at fewer theaters than those
movies and its length, at nearly three hours, limited the number of
shows. (``Saving Private Ryan,'' however, a film of similar length,
opened No. 1 at $30 million.)
</P>
<P>
   Although there were a handful of negative reviews for the film,
most critics welcomed it as a challenging and powerful drama.
Directed by the Academy Award winner Jonathan Demme, the movie is
set just before and after the Civil War and focuses on an ex-slave,
Sethe, played by Ms. Winfrey, who has survived unspeakable horrors.
The bleakness of the subject has been a challenge to Disney's
marketing and publicity executives, who have been helped by Ms.
Winfrey's full-court personal promotion on television, in
newspapers and in magazines.
</P>
<P>
   The film, costing $53 million and an additional $30 million to
promote, faces a serious struggle at the box office. As an added
burden carried by ``Beloved,'' films dealing with African-American
themes generally fare badly in the lucrative overseas market.
</P>
<P>
   Even in competitive Hollywood, studio executives want
``Beloved'' to succeed, largely because so few mainstream films
tackle serious subjects. Should ``Beloved'' fail at the box office,
it would make it harder to produce big-budget serious films,
especially those dealing with race.

<P>
   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti _ Columbus stumbled across it in 1504 but
never bothered to come back, and later explorers scorned it as a
worthless outcropping of rock and bird dung.
</P>
<P>
   All of a sudden, though, the United States and Haiti are
squabbling over the status of Navassa, an uninhabited Caribbean
island barely two miles square that both countries claim as their
own.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute, which Haiti is threatening to take to international
tribunals, arose after an American scientific expedition authorized
by the Interior Department spent two weeks on the island this
summer. The group returned with tales of finding ``biological
riches unimagined,'' which led Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt to
warn of his intention to protect the island from interlopers _ with
Coast Guard vessels if necessary.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you were going to consider a system of protected areas,
you'd definitely want to include Navassa in the portfolio,'' said
Michael Smith, leader of the expedition, which was sponsored by the
Center for Marine Conservation, a Washington-based environmental
group.
</P>
<P>
   ``Navassa has a very special and extremely healthy coral reef,''
he added, ``and it is absolutely remarkable how much animal life we
found there, including new species that are endemic to the
island.''
</P>
<P>
   The United States has controlled Navassa, just 40 miles off
Haiti's southwest peninsula, for more than 140 years. But of the 24
constitutions Haiti has had since gaining independence from France
in 1804, all but one of them described La Navase, as the island is
called here, as an inalienable part of Haitian territory.
</P>
<P>
   The basis of the American claim is the Guano Islands Act of
1856, which authorized American vessels to establish sovereignty on
any abandoned or unclaimed island that had reserves of the rich
fertilizer derived from bird droppings. A year later, an American
sea captain, Peter Duncan, planted the American flag on Navassa,
which was followed by several decades of phosphate mining and
construction of a Coast Guard lighthouse that was abandoned only in
the 1950s.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Navassa ``is unorganized American territory, meaning that
Congress has never set up or passed any statutes prescribing any
particular type of administration,'' Babbitt said in a telephone
interview from Washington. ``In the absence of that, the Interior
Department is traditionally the place where these matters are dealt
with.''
</P>
<P>
   Babbitt declined to comment on Haiti's claim to the island,
referring the matter to the State Department, which has
consistently claimed American sovereignty for the Island. ``I'm
just the head gamekeeper around here,'' he said. ``My job is to
administer the place and protect the coral reefs, and that's what
we're doing.''
</P>
<P>
   But he did add that he regards Navassa's legal status as no
different from that of several uninhabited islands in the Pacific
that the United States administers, including Howland and Midway
Islands.
</P>
<P>
   But Foreign Minister Fritz Longchamp of Haiti rejects the notion
that Navassa is American territory of any sort. He pointed to the
1697 Treaty of Rijswijk, in which Spain gave up sovereignty over
Haiti and the adjoining islands to France, and dismissed American
possession of the island, and some 4,000 square miles of seabed
around it, as irrelevant under international law.
</P>
<P>
   ``La Navase is Haitian and a part of Haiti,'' he said in an
interview here. ``If I own something and I make a decision not to
use it, that does not give you the right to come and claim it
because I have not been using it. How many islands off the coast of
the United States are not inhabited? Does that mean anyone can come
and claim them too?''
</P>
<P>
   Complicating the situation even further, William Warren, a
California businessman who says he wants to mine Navassa for
organic fertilizer, has also made an ownership claim. He has filed
suit against Babbitt and Secretary of State Madeleine Albright,
citing a 1905 document in which the State Department said it
``possessed no territorial sovereignty'' over the island.
</P>
<P>
   For weeks now, the Navassa imbroglio has filled news broadcasts
and talk shows here. At one point last month, the American
ambassador, Timothy Carney, even suggested that since Haiti has
many internal problems that need attention, the country's energies
might be better directed toward resolving those issues, rather than
focusing on a tiny island that few Haitians other than fishermen
have ever visited.
</P>
<P>
   Since Haiti is the poorest nation in the Western Hemisphere and
has been without a functioning government for the last 16 months,
that observation, indelicate though it may have been, seemed
self-evident. Nevertheless, Haitians have taken umbrage at Carney's
remarks and begun to spin extravagant fantasies about his motives
in pressing the American claim to the island.
</P>
<P>
   Lafanmi Lavalas, the political party organized by former
President Jean-Bertrand Aristide, immediately condemned the
American position and organized a protest late last month. Haiti is
also awash with rumors that the United States covets Navassa
because the August expedition discovered gold or uranium there or
even, according to one version making the rounds here, a gateway to
Atlantis.
</P>
<P>
   Those conjectures are baseless, but ``there is a great dollar
dividend if we are talking biotechnology'' derived from some of the
spider and insect species unique to the island, said Ernst Wilson,
a Haitian oceanographer who has organized La Navase Island Defense
Group to assert the Haitian claim.
</P>
<P>
   ``La Navase is a perfect laboratory, and biotechnological and
pharmaceutical companies are going to want to get into this because
there is money there, I know it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Smith said that in the interests of lowering the political
temperature, he would be willing to include Haitian scientists like
Wilson on future visits to the island. His goal, he stressed, is to
assure that Navassa remains a pristine refuge for animal and plant
species whose existence is endangered elsewhere in the Caribbean.
</P>
<P>
   ``Science should be an activity that bridges diplomatic problems
between countries,'' he said. ``As an American organization, we are
subject to the Supreme Court ruling which says Navassa was properly
annexed. But whoever ends up with jurisdiction over the island, we
would like to see them manage it well.''

STORM-BATTERED CENTRAL TEXAS ASSESSES DAMAGE

<P>
   NEW BRAUNFELS, Texas _ In San Antonio, the Red Cross had to
evacuate its downtown headquarters, losing its telephones and lists
of volunteers to rising water.
</P>
<P>
   In nearby Seguin, the main water treatment plant washed out and
left the farming town of 21,000 without potable water.
</P>
<P>
   In Austin, firefighters bustled 50 members of a Jazzercise class
out of a recreation center along Shoal Creek just minutes before
floodwaters swept through the building's parking lot and claimed
four parked automobiles.
</P>
<P>
   All over the Central Texas hill country Sunday, residents warily
watched leaden skies and began to clean up after record-breaking
rains blanketed the area on Saturday, claiming at least seven lives
statewide including five in San Antonio. Two small children were
reported missing in Caldwell County, east of Austin, according to
the Texas Department of Public Safety.
</P>
<P>
   The heavy rains were expected to continue Sunday night, though
with less intensity.
</P>
<P>
   Within the 90-mile-long Austin-San Antonio Corridor, Bexar,
Comal and Hays counties had been declared disaster areas by local
officials, and hundreds of intersections remained impassable by
mid-afternoon Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   In New Braunfels, 1,400 people spent the night in emergency
shelters as the Guadalupe and Comal rivers _ swollen by a record
21.5 inches of rain _ roared out of their banks through parts of
the city, flooding neighborhoods and destroying dozens of homes.
</P>
<P>
   George Snell, director of the local Red Cross, said survey teams
assisted by the National Guard were still assessing the extent of
the damage late Sunday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're having difficulty getting into some areas because of
high water and we don't have any definitive counts yet. So far
we've had no loss of life reported here, but it's clear there's
been a lot of property damage,'' he said. Snell said it could be
days before a clear picture of the storm's total devastation
emerges.

CHINESE MILITARY GAINED IN U.S. EXPORT-POLICY SHIFT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Md., S.C.)  (lb) 
 By JEFF GERTH and ERIC SCHMITT    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Shortly after he took office in 1993, President
Clinton traveled to Silicon Valley to lay out his vision of a
robust U.S. economy buoyed by high-technology companies that could
compete anywhere in the world.
</P>
<P>
   The night before his speech, Clinton went out to dinner with two
dozen executives, some of whom complained bitterly about government
rules impeding the overseas sale of computers and other
cutting-edge technologies.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton grabbed a pad, furiously took notes, and promised
relief, one executive recalled.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next five years, the president delivered, personally
presiding over what industry executives and government officials
agree was one of the most sweeping relaxations of export
restrictions in U.S. history.
</P>
<P>
   ``These reforms,'' Clinton said in a 1993 letter detailing the
changes to a leading computer executive, ``can help unleash our
companies to compete successfully in the global market.''
</P>
<P>
   In the years that followed, the new rules helped Clinton fulfill
his vision of a centrist Democratic Party with close ties to U.S.
business. Grateful high-technology companies showered the
Democratic Party with campaign contributions, cementing a new
financial base for a party that has historically struggled to raise
money from corporate America.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials portray the initiatives as one of
Clinton's most lasting legacies, saying it bolstered national
security by helping to make the United States' economy the world's
strongest. The flood of new exports also created high-paying jobs
at home.
</P>
<P>
   But critics, including Republicans in Congress and some former
Clinton administration officials, argue that the high-technology
exports had a serious side effect, strengthening countries like
China, which some view as a potential adversary. Clinton, they
contend, was blinded by his enthusiasm for securing the United
States' global edge and insufficiently attentive to his policies'
effect on long-term U.S. national security.
</P>
<P>
   House and Senate committees are examining whether China took
advantage of the looser rules on exports to enhance its military
and to obtain technology that it passed on to rogue states,
including North Korea. The Senate Intelligence Committee and a
special House panel, which are scheduled to report their findings
in early 1999, have held a series of closed-door hearings this
fall.
</P>
<P>
   An examination by The New York Times of the administration's
export policies on China, based on interviews as well as government
and industry documents, shows that the looser regulations enabled
Chinese companies to obtain a wide range of sophisticated
technology, some of which has already been diverted to military
uses.
</P>
<P>
   The new rules allowed U.S. companies to sell a host of products
without prior government approval, from high-speed computers to
machine tools to communications gear previously subject to
restrictions during the Cold War. While the regulations fostered
trade, they made it much harder for intelligence agencies to track
how U.S. equipment was used overseas, administration officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   Until 1993, most sales to China of goods with possible military
uses required U.S. companies to obtain a government license naming
both the customer and the location in which the equipment would be
installed.
</P>
<P>
   Senior officials acknowledge that Clinton decided to change the
rules without a rigorous review by intelligence officials or other
national security experts.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, CIA analysts wrote a report warning of the military
implications of technology transfers to China, but it never became
an official assessment, because senior aides felt it was ``not well
done and lacked analytical depth,'' a U.S. official said.
</P>
<P>
   The government's last serious examination of technology sales to
China, they said, had been conducted by the Reagan administration
in 1984 at a time when the United States was trying to build up
China as a counterweight against the Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, the Soviet Union has collapsed. And China has been
caught selling missile equipment to nations like Iran and Pakistan
while using its new access to Western technology to expand its
economic and military power.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Wolfowitz, a former official in the State and Defense
departments who participated in the 1984 study, asserted that
international developments since then argue for a tightening of
controls on sales to China, not a loosening.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is an urgent need for a fundamental review of export
policy to China especially because China is in the process of
becoming _ albeit still quite slowly _ the major strategic
competitor and potential threat to the United States and its allies
in the first half of the next century,'' said Wolfowitz, who is
dean of the Paul H. Nitze School of Advanced International Studies
at Johns Hopkins University.
</P>
<P>
   But another China expert sees Beijing's improvement of its
technologically backward military as more benign.
</P>
<P>
   ``Its overall policy is not to be a troublemaker,'' said Doak
Barnett, a professor emeritus at Johns Hopkins, who added that
``gradually building up its defense establishment is something I
would expect it to do, but in my view it's not threatening.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever China's intentions, the Clinton administration over the
last five years has approved export to China of $3 billion in
technology with military or civilian applications, about 5 percent
of overall U.S. sales to China.
</P>
<P>
   A report prepared for the Commerce Department last December
concludes that the administration has little means of knowing
whether this equipment is harming U.S. national security or being
used by Chinese industries to challenge U.S. competitors and jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It may be too late by the time that U.S. industry and/or
government realize there is a problem emerging in either of these
areas,'' the confidential report says.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. intelligence agencies are trying to assess how much the
Chinese military has gained from the imports. Officials say they
have already concluded that China's army gained access to some of
the high-speed computers sold to civilian customers since 1996,
when the rules on computer exports were eased. The officials said
the agencies were unable to assess how the equipment was being
used, because they lacked basic information about the deals.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton administration officials said that the Chinese have
returned the one computer that was improperly diverted and that a
new agreement between the two countries will improve the ability of
U.S. officials to check the whereabouts of equipment exported to
China.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Christopher Cox, R-S.C., who heads the select House panel
on technology transfers to China, said, ``There's always been a
tension within the government about which exports are proper.''
</P>
<P>
   But, he added, ``these days without question the overriding
impulse to sell, sell, sell is in the ascendancy.''

<P>
   The Old System
</P>
<P>
   Cold War Rules Get New Scrutiny
</P>
<P>
   The United States and its Western allies zealously guarded their
technological edge during the Cold War, forbidding the sale to
communist-bloc nations of any item with a conceivable military use.
Military contractors did not chafe too much under the restrictions,
because the Pentagon had a seemingly limitless budget for their
wares.
</P>
<P>
   In 1983, Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping complained bitterly about
the restrictions on technology exports, prompting the Reagan
administration to ease some of the rules for China. It was seen in
the United States' interest, Wolfowitz recently told Congress, to
help Beijing develop the military muscle needed to counter the
``formidable threat'' from the Soviet Union. In addition, he said,
China had been helpful in arming the Afghan rebels.
</P>
<P>
   The United States, however, maintained tight controls over what
he termed the most sensitive technologies _ those that could
improve China's missiles or anti-submarine capabilities.
</P>
<P>
   The fall of communism brought a precipitous drop in the Pentagon
budget, prompting the defense industry to scramble for new markets.
Companies that once made spy satellites for U.S. spy agencies began
making equipment for cellular networks that served China or Russia.
</P>
<P>
   They quickly confronted a significant obstacle to making money
on sales to former adversaries. The Cold War-era rules remained
largely in effect, and they were being interpreted by career
officials who had devoted their lives to blocking exports to Russia
and its allies.
</P>
<P>
   Enter Bill Clinton. His 1992 campaign had been driven by the
slogan ``It's the economy, stupid.'' Aides say Clinton's views on
foreign policy were framed by his experiences as a governor of
Arkansas, a poor state that looked overseas for investments and
markets, and he arrived in Washington determined to expand trade.
</P>
<P>
   In an immediate sign of this policy's political importance,
Clinton sent the Democratic Party's chief fund-raiser, Ron Brown,
to take over the Commerce Department, which promotes U.S. exports.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon was traditionally the strongest voice against
technology exports, and Clinton made several appointments
calculated to change the culture.
</P>
<P>
   William Perry, an executive at a Silicon Valley company who was
vocally opposed to the existing system of export controls, was
named deputy defense secretary and then defense secretary. John
Deutch, a professor with similar views, was named to a senior post
at the Pentagon, and then became director of central intelligence.
</P>
<P>
   Perry, testifying at his confirmation hearing to be deputy
defense secretary, told senators in February 1993 that controlling
dual-use technology is ``a hopeless task.'' He continued, ``It only
interferes with our companies' ability to succeed internationally
if we try to impose all sorts of controls in that area.''
</P>
<P>
   Perry said ``we really need to bear down'' on controlling the
most critical components necessary to build weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton took a personal interest in the new policy. Shortly
after he returned from his foray to Silicon Valley, he spelled out
his intentions in a letter to Edward McCracken, the chief executive
officer of computer maker Silicon Graphics. Company officials had
complained to Clinton over dinner about export rules.
</P>
<P>
   ``One reason I ran for president was to tailor export controls
to the realization of a post-Cold War world,'' Clinton wrote.
</P>
<P>
   After noting the need to retain strong controls in some areas to
combat the spread of nuclear, chemical and biological weapons,
Clinton detailed his intention to ``unleash our companies to
compete successfully in the global market.'' The United States, he
said, would slash red tape and loosen controls on the overseas sale
of computers, telecommunication equipment and machine-making tools.
</P>
<P>
   The New System
</P>
<P>
   Relaxed Rules Benefit Chinese
</P>
<P>
   Those restrictions were an integral part of the Cold War. For
decades, every proposed export of technology was weighed by a
committee of Western nations. It had authority to block sales
involving military hardware or so-called ``dual-use'' equipment
that had military or civilian applications.
</P>
<P>
   Even before the committee disbanded in 1994, the Clinton
administration moved to ease restrictions on the sales of many
dual-use items. The new rules allowed companies to export many
categories of technology without applying for a government license.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. companies were delighted with the new system, which
relieved them of a time-consuming and frustrating process. But the
benefits came with a cost. Because sales could be made without
export licenses, the government and its intelligence agencies no
longer had a record of many deals that involved dual-use equipment.
There was no way to trace patterns of sales _ to know, for example,
how many decoding devices were being sold to a particular country.
</P>
<P>
   Commerce Department internal documents show that China has been
a major beneficiary of this policy. According to a 1995 estimate,
more than $1.9 billion in annual trade with China had been removed
from federal scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
   A ban remains in effect on the sale to China of the most
militarily potent technologies, like ballistic missiles, spy
satellites and advanced fighter aircraft. Beijing buys those
weapons from Russia, Europe and Israel.
</P>
<P>
   ``China has benefited more than any other country from U.S.
decontrols on certain dual-use commodities enacted in late 1993 and
early 1994,'' one Commerce Department document says. ``There has
been a 60 percent decrease in the number of individual export
licenses required for trade with China (from 2,229 in 1993 to only
925 in 1994).''
</P>
<P>
   The rules shifted much of the burden for controlling exports to
the companies making the deals.
</P>
<P>
   Previously, the applications for licenses to sell sophisticated
electronic equipment overseas were scrutinized by Pentagon and
intelligence analysts. One crucial question was whether the
customer was really a ``front'' for military users barred from
buying such equipment.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration's new policy relied on industry
executives to raise questions about their own sales. They were
required to seek a Commerce Department license only if they
believed the equipment would end up in military hands.
</P>
<P>
   Aerospace officials say they are ill equipped to make such
evaluations.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the administration began making public the names of
questionable customers, to warn exporters. But industry officials
said the list of about a dozen nuclear-production facilities was a
tiny slice of what was available and ignored entities involved in
missile activity.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is particularly acute, industry executives said,
when the deals involved China, where the military has long played a
role in commercial ventures and where it is difficult to
distinguish between military officers' personal and professional
dealings.
</P>
<P>
   One of the first deals under the new rules, a 1994 sale of
telecommunications equipment to China, illustrates the
complexities. The Commerce Department's decision to allow such
exports without a license made it easier for AT&AMP;T and other U.S.
companies to sell hundreds of millions of dollars in sophisticated
equipment to Chinese companies building civil telecommunication
networks.
</P>
<P>
   An examination of the deal by the General Accounting Office, the
audit arm of Congress, found that the equipment was sold to a
Chinese-U.S. joint venture, Hua Mei, ``without Commerce review,
even though the company was partially controlled by several
high-level members of the Chinese military.''
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T officials in turn told the audit agency that ``they did not
ask the Commerce Department to determine if Hua Mei was a civil end
user, nor were they required to.''
</P>
<P>
   It is not known whether the company has put the equipment to
military use. But Pentagon officials told the GAO that in 1994,
China's army was seeking to buy this same type of technology, as it
moved to improve its communications networks.
</P>
<P>
   The Reassessment
</P>
<P>
   A Computer Sale Sets Off Alarms
</P>
<P>
   By 1995, the Pentagon was urging Congress to look more closely
at export policy. Military officials noted that the effect of
technology was cumulative, and that while individual sales might
appear benign, a combination of cutting-edge acquisitions would
allow an adversary to build much better bombs or radars.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, documents show, was moving in the opposite direction.
</P>
<P>
   According to a 1995 Commerce Department document, the president
``made clear,'' in private conversations he had with Brown, that
``he does not believe we have done enough to streamline and
liberalize.''
</P>
<P>
   The document mapped out how Brown should lobby high-level
administration officials to ease controls on computer exports and
shift items like communications satellites, engine technology and
commercial data-scrambling devices. Such items were on a list of
equipment that required a State Department license, and companies
believed they could close more deals if authority over the exports
were moved to Brown's Commerce Department.
</P>
<P>
   Their enthusiasm for the Commerce Department was well grounded.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to proposed sales of an item regulated by the
State Department, the Pentagon holds a virtual veto, a privilege it
exercised regularly during the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
   The Commerce Department is responsible for promoting U.S.
exports. When it weighs an overseas deal, the Pentagon has only one
vote out of five agencies, and the right to appeal if its
objections are overruled, which has been rarely used.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Warren Christopher insisted that his
department retain jurisdiction. He was overruled in early 1996 by
Clinton, opening the way to billions of dollars of satellite sales
to Chinese companies.
</P>
<P>
   At about the same time, the administration was weighing whether
to lift restrictions on the export of some advanced computers.
Officials asked outside consultants to study the issue, and they
came back with a report that asserted the controls were pointless.
The powerful computers manufactured by U.S. companies would soon be
widely available from foreign competitors, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   The administration asked the consultants to assess whether
computer sales could pose a threat to the U.S. military. Their
report did not take a position, saying the government did not have
enough information to draw a conclusion.
</P>
<P>
   This left the issue to Clinton, who decided to fulfill his
pledge to the Silicon Valley executives and relax the restrictions.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president made a judgment on what the threat was, and the
president's judgment was reflected in his decision,'' said William
Reinsch, undersecretary of commerce for export administration. The
new rules took effect early in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after, Chinese companies bought 77 of the high-speed
computers, which can be used to predict weather patterns but can
also scramble secret communications or design powerful nuclear
weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Disclosure of those sales prompted Congress to reinstate license
requirements for some advanced computers.
</P>
<P>
   This year, the CIA and other federal agencies concluded that at
least some of those computers are now being used by China's
military. The details of their use remain unclear, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   A review by the GAO last month called into question the
administration's basic assumptions in lifting the controls on
computers. Contrary to what the consultants said in their report,
the international market for advanced computers remains strongly
dominated by U.S. companies.
</P>
<P>
   Congress acted after The New York Times reported that two U.S.
aerospace companies were under investigation to determine whether
they went too far in sharing rocket technology with Chinese
scientists seeking to determine the causes of a failed satellite
launch in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The inquiry, which continues, has since been broadened to
include a failed launch in 1995. Rocket technology for ballistic
missiles is similar to that used to send satellites into orbit.
Both companies have denied wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   Just this month, Congress reversed Clinton's 1996 decision and
returned satellite exports to the State Department. At the same
time, lawmakers created a new senior Pentagon position for
technology security after concluding that military officials' role
in controlling exports to countries like China had been
``significantly and improperly reduced over the years.''
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   The Fallout
</P>
<P>
   Report Cites a Loss of Oversight Role
</P>
<P>
   The military significance of the United States' exports to China
is hotly debated.
</P>
<P>
   China's army is in the throes of modernization. For now, Beijing
is more of a regional power than a global threat.
</P>
<P>
   A commission headed by former Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld
concluded in July that the looser controls on exports, coupled with
lax enforcement, had increased the possibility that rogue nations
like Iran or North Korea would build ballistic missiles that could
hit the United States.
</P>
<P>
   China ``poses a threat to the United States'' by supplying
technology to these pariah states, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   Commission members said they were startled at how much the
government had freed the export of dual-use technology and how
little U.S. officials could do to track its use or ensure that it
was not diverted to terrorists or foreign militaries.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's particularly troubling,'' said James Woolsey, a
commission member who was Clinton's first director of central
intelligence, ``is that the massive decontrol in the last few years
of the export of dual-use technology in general, and specifically
to China, has made it almost impossible for the U.S. to monitor
where such technology has gone, much less exercise any control over
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Another commission member, Barry Blechman, said technology
transfer ``is a central reason why we reached our conclusion.''
</P>
<P>
   Blechman is president of DFI International, the Washington
consulting firm that prepared a confidential report for the
Commerce Department in December on technology transfers to China.
</P>
<P>
   The report concludes that China does not currently pose a direct
threat to U.S. competitiveness in high technology. But it might in
the future, especially in areas like electronics, which by 1996 had
become China's top export back to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Then Clinton's policy might wind up being turned upside down,
with China jeopardizing the same high-paying jobs that Clinton used
to justify increasing exports to China.
</P>
<P>
   According to the report, the concern is that ``as Chinese
manufacturing becomes more sophisticated and technical in nature''
_ thanks in part to U.S. and Western exports of that technology _
``Chinese high-tech products could potentially undercut such
products (and therefore jobs as well.)''

`BELOVED': SLAVERY ECHOES IN THE PRISM OF A FILM
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By MARGO JEFFERSON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   While film executives raise their eyebrows and ponder the fate
of ``Beloved'' as a high-profile ``race movie,'' let us consider
other more interesting and honest ways in which it can be seen.
</P>
<P>
   This big, rich film, based on Toni Morrison's extraordinary
novel of the same name, has been called ``my `Schindler's List'''
by its star and co-producer, Oprah Winfrey. Which means that it is
a harrowing, fact-based story about people who outwit and outlast
war, holding out for a future that no one intended them to have.
</P>
<P>
   ``Schindler's List'' was about Germany's war against the Jews.
Think of slavery as the American South's war against
African-Americans, and think of slaves as war veterans and
survivors who, like prison and concentration camp inmates, have to
reconstruct their souls as well as their bodies when the war ends.
</P>
<P>
   But ``Beloved'' is also a women's picture, Hollywood's
time-honored antidote to the war movie. It is a fierce melodrama
(never a derogatory word in my book) about a woman cast out by her
community _ in this case, the newly freed, self-consciously
respectable black community of Ohio _ for sins committed as a
sexual being or a mother. Never mind that her deed was noble as
well as monstrous. Sethe, played by Ms. Winfrey, must work through
her destiny of punishment, expiation and sacrifice.
</P>
<P>
   What a pleasing irony that the only other big Hollywood film I
can recall that so effectively joins the war drama to the women's
picture is ``Gone With the Wind.'' We get only brief flashbacks to
plantation days here (I need hardly say how different the
perspective is), and we have no Civil War battles. The blacks of
this world have left their plantations, and Sethe has managed to
improve her lot simply by acquiring what Scarlett O'Hara deemed the
mark of her degradation: a piece of property no one else cared for
and a subsistence living.
</P>
<P>
   We have a troubled couple, too: Sethe and Paul D, the brother of
her long-lost husband, trying to make sense of each other and
trying to make a life together. But the stars, Ms. Winfrey and
Danny Glover, look much more like the people we see every day than
like the ones we usually see in the movies. It has been a long time
since filmgoers were allowed to be moved watching hard-working
middle-aged people fall in love and make love.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, ``Beloved'' is a multilayered ghost story in which the
unquiet dead return to claim the living. Sethe and her youngest
daughter, Denver, live in a haunted house, in thrall to the angry
ghost of Sethe's dead child. When Paul D moves in, the isolated,
unhappy Denver grows jealous; so does the ghost, for she takes
human form, calling herself Beloved. And what does she want?
Nothing less than Sethe's soul.
</P>
<P>
   Black families are rarely viewed as prey to the kinds of
psychological complexities that have been at the center of the
West's intellectual history since Freud. But here we are in
``Beloved,'' nine years out of slavery, with a full-blown Freudian
family romance.
</P>
<P>
   Children witness the primal scene (their mother having sex with
a man who is not even their father); daughters punish the male
intruder with rejection or attempts at seduction; sisters compete
for their mother's love. And over it all is a past that has laid
siege to every sanctioned notion of what a family can or should be.
What emotional burdens _ call them curses _ does someone who has
endured certain horrors pass on to the next generation? The
children of survivors are nurtured on their parents' nightmares as
well as on their love.
</P>
<P>
   When ``Beloved'' was first published in 1987, some were
uncomfortable with its supernatural aspect. But it was a brilliant
choice. Ghosts embody what is almost past enduring: murder,
imprisonment, guilt and shame over deeds that cannot be undone. The
19th century produced some of our greatest ghost stories.
</P>
<P>
   And not only novels; I am thinking of black folklore, of all
those slavery-shaped tales in which bloody bones rise up to utter
curses and devils stroll into backyards to make small talk before
the deadly bargain is struck. Richard Wright wrote that if Edgar
Allan Poe had been black, he would not have invented horror, horror
would have invented him. In ``Beloved,'' the inventor and the
invention are as one.
</P>
<P>
   The director of ``Beloved,'' Jonathan Demme, understands all of
these elements, though sometimes he staggers under their weight. He
works well with actors (don't just think of ``Philadelphia'' or
``The Silence of the Lambs,'' think of ``Melvin and Howard'' and
``Something Wild''), and he has a first-rate cast here.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Winfrey is very good as Sethe, who both invents and is
invented by horror. She projects self-protective sternness, but
also vulnerability at those moments when Sethe finds herself
opening up slightly, against her will. As Paul D, Glover is even
better. He is such an attentive actor, making emotional shifts
(from wariness to bravado to a wordless melancholy) with unfussy
honesty.
</P>
<P>
   But it is Kimberly Elise as Denver and Thandie Newton as Beloved
who give the most fascinating performances. Ms. Elise is the moody,
isolated child in a family where tragedy has sopped up too much
parental emotion. Born in Ohio, Denver is the one least marked by
slavery, the one filled with silent yearning for another life. For
her, freedom means finding a way to live and thrive outside that
memory- and mother-haunted house. Ms. Elise's work is subtle and
nuanced. Ms. Newton's is uncanny and amazingly bold.
</P>
<P>
   Despite looking like a lovely young woman, her Beloved begins
human life where she left off when she died: as a voracious infant
who can barely walk or talk, who smears food all over her face and
stuffs it into her gaping mouth, who weeps, rages, giggles, demands
her way, then vomits and goes to sleep if she is thwarted. And she
rolls her eyes constantly, the way slightly brain-damaged children
do, but also the way those repellent caricatures of pickaninnies
used to. She is terrifying to watch.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, ``Beloved'' is a powerful story of postwar
reconciliation. And I certainly hope it will reach audiences with
at least the force of ``Gone With the Wind.'' The tale is every bit
as compelling and infinitely more truthful. (How can there be
reconciliation without truth?) It is also infinitely more generous,
and in this way reminds me of William Wyler's film about World War
II veterans and families, ``The Best Years of Our Lives.'' (Isn't
it interesting that the Civil War feels as close, sometimes closer,
as World War II?)
</P>
<P>
   In Wyler's film, too, the war has ended, but the changes it has
wrought are everywhere. How do people grapple with what they saw
and did, with the physical, psychological and spiritual damage they
suffered? How do they resume a life with their families, or put
together a family from whomever is left over? And how, between the
hard cold social and economic facts of life and the subtler but no
less implacable emotional ones, do they learn to claim the right
not just to life or liberty but to the pursuit of happiness?

VISIT FAILS TO NARROW DIFFERENCES BETWEEN CHINA AND TAIWAN 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By ERIK ECKHOLM   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING, China _ As a senior official from Taiwan ended a
landmark visit here on Sunday, China and Taiwan promised to
continue talking but also reiterated their profoundly different
visions about the island's political status.
</P>
<P>
   The differences, extending even to what they ought to discuss,
suggest that a solution to one of Asia's most dangerous rifts
remains distant.
</P>
<P>
   ``Only when the Chinese mainland has achieved democracy can the
two sides of the Taiwan Strait talk about reunification,'' said Koo
Chen-fu, the 81-year-old tycoon representing Taiwan here. His
statement followed an hour-and-a-quarter discussion with China's
president and Communist Party leader, Jiang Zemin.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday morning, after Koo had a blunt exchange of views with
Deputy Prime Minister Qian Qichen, Koo complained that China still
failed to recognize ``one simple fact, which is the existence of
the Republic of China.''
</P>
<P>
   After the morning meeting a Chinese spokesman, Tang Shubei, said
Taiwan must ``look upon the mainland objectively and bravely face
up to the international situation.'' He added, ``Don't be an
ostrich.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, both sides seemed anxious to put the best face on this
visit and to keep the diplomatic wheels spinning into the future.
Even if they produce no breakthrough, continued talks are seen by
both sides _ and by keenly interested bystanders such as the United
States _ as a way to head off a disastrous conflict that nobody
wants.
</P>
<P>
   China considers Taiwan a renegade province and is anxious to
negotiate its return to the motherland.
</P>
<P>
   Taiwan, in the decades since 1949 when defeated Nationalist
troops fled the Communist victory on the mainland, has become a
relatively prosperous democracy. More and more its people have an
independent identity, and its government vows it will not even
consider rejoining the mainland until China, too, is transformed.
</P>
<P>
   Koo, leader of Taiwan's semiofficial Straights Exchange
Foundation, came to China Wednesday to meet with his counterpart,
Wang Daohan, 84, the leader of China's Association for Relations
Across the Taiwan Straits. The two elder statesmen met in Singapore
in 1993. But a second meeting scheduled in 1995 was canceled by
China, which was angered by what it saw as Taiwanese moves toward
independence.
</P>
<P>
   Relations reached a dangerous low in the following year as China
shot missiles near Taiwan during its presidential elections,
disrupting commerce, and the United States warned China to back off
by sending two aircraft carriers near the area.
</P>
<P>
   China has vowed to attack Taiwan if it declares independence and
is pressing for political negotiations aimed at bringing Taiwan
under its wing. It has offered to give Taiwan greater autonomy than
that granted last year to Hong Kong, including the right to
preserve its capitalist economy, hold elections and maintain its
own army _ if it will accept Chinese sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
   But Taiwan refuses to negotiate about its political status,
insisting that China must acknowledge that Taiwan is already a
sovereign, separate country in practice. Instead, Taiwan wants to
talk about technical matters like fishing disputes and the
treatment of cross-straits visitors and businesses.
</P>
<P>
   During the current visit, the two sides pledged to continue with
the newly reopened dialogue and Wang, the Chinese official,
accepted an invitation to visit Taiwan at an undetermined future
point.
</P>
<P>
   Reflecting the clear desire of both sides to keep up positive
momentum, the question of future agendas was blurred: The Chinese
said Taiwan had agreed to include political matters in a mix of
topics, while the Taiwanese said Sunday that all the practical
issues they wish to discuss include, of course, a political
element.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting Sunday morning between Koo and Qian included the
most pointed and honest exchanges in a visit that had been mostly
filled with smiling toasts and visits to the opera and tourist
sites, first in Shanghai and then in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   In his meeting with Jiang late Sunday afternoon, which lasted
half an hour longer than scheduled, Koo said in an interview, the
divisive central question of Taiwan's political future was not
directly discussed. He described the meeting as pleasant and
friendly, and said the two engaged in a general discussion about
the meaning of democracy, with Jiang stressing that the mainland
had its own needs and path.
</P>
<P>
   A central goal of China, as well as of many Taiwanese
businessmen, is for Taiwan to lift its restrictions on direct
travel, commerce and communications across the straits at a time
when Taiwanese investment and trade here are climbing. Koo said the
restrictive policy represented Taiwan's effort ``to strike a
balance between security and commercial concerns.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If we could get assurance that China will not use force
against us, then we could talk about this,'' he said in the
interview.
</P>
<P>
   The Taiwanese, while stressing their desire for friendly
dialogue, took several opportunities to publicize their positions
during the visit.
</P>
<P>
   When Wang, the Chinese official, agreed to make a return visit
to Taiwan, the Taiwanese immediately suggested that he come in
early December, so he could view first-hand the country's
democratic legislative elections. The Chinese said that would be a
bit too soon.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   During the current visit, officials back in Taiwan publicly
complained that China was aggressively continuing its strategy of
isolating Taiwan diplomatically, avidly courting some of the 27
countries that still recognize Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   In Sunday morning's meeting, Qian, the Chinese official, said
that it was only a natural development that more countries would
switch allegiance from Taiwan to the mainland, since that was the
official U.N. position, according to Chinese media accounts.
</P>
<P>
   The Taiwanese brought along, as the third-ranking member in
their delegation, a man with a well-known history as a democracy
advocate inside Taiwan, who is now associated with a
pro-independence opposition party. They asked if he could be one of
the small group attending the Koo-Jiang meeting, but the Chinese
refused. So Sunday evening, when Koo gave a final news conference,
the man, Kang Ning-hsiang, was also given a chance to speak and he
made his plea for democracy in China.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday morning, Koo surprised the Chinese by announcing that
Taiwan was considering asking to join an American-led multinational
program in North Korea that aims to prevent production of nuclear
weapons ingredients by helping to provide other energy sources.
China is generally annoyed by Taiwanese efforts like this to gain
international acceptance as an equal partner, but Sunday it had no
clear reaction to this proposal.
</P>
<P>
   Koo, despite the obvious gulf in the positions, said he was
encouraged by the visit. ``We'll keep talking, and we'll find ways
to narrow the differences,'' he said in the interview. ``We do have
the patience.''
</P>
<P>
   Taiwan's interest in patience is clear enough, but diplomats
here wonder and worry how patient China, for its part, will be on
the issue of reunification, which Chinese officials constantly call
their overriding foreign policy goal.

   A Possible Kroger Merger Draws Traders' Interest
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street is speculating that Kroger Co., the nation's largest
supermarket chain, will buy Fred Meyer, the owner of the Ralphs
Grocery chain in Southern California, in a move that would create
the first grocery chain spanning most of the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Fred Meyer's shares soared $3.6875, or 8 percent, to $49 on the
New York Stock Exchange on Friday. The stock has gained 27 percent
since Oct. 8. Kroger's shares fell $1.1875, to $48.75.
</P>
<P>
   When a Loss Could Be a Victory
</P>
<P>
   In the Byzantine world of telecommunications regulation, a loss
before the U.S. Supreme Court could turn out to be a victory for
local telephone companies when it comes to the prices long-distance
companies pay for access to local networks.
</P>
<P>
   Celebrating Every Man's Inner Guy
</P>
<P>
   Maxim, described by magazine consultants as the Playboy of the
1990s, is an unlikely success story at a time when the competition
in the men's magazine market is heated and most men's titles are
aiming for a sophisticated, advertiser-friendly audience. Instead
of encouraging sophistication, Maxim encourages its readers to
exist in a perpetual state of chest-thumping, girl-chasing,
adolescent jokesterism.
</P>
<P>
   Helping The World Spend Its Free Time
</P>
<P>
   Time Out, the listings magazine that began 30 years ago in a
London basement, has found its way in the world. The magazine's
name now adorns not just editions in London and New York, but also
franchises in Rome and Paris, along with an array of eating,
drinking and shopping guides.
</P>
<P>
   Perils of Covering Parent Company
</P>
<P>
   A shelved investigative report by an ABC News reporter about
hiring and safety practices at Disney World, the Florida theme park
owned by ABC's parent, Walt Disney, illustrates the thorny problems
journalists have in examining their own companies.
</P>
<P>
   Debate Over Census of Newsrooms
</P>
<P>
   As the governing board of the American Society of Newspaper
Editors prepares to meet in Miami on Monday, a proposal that women
be counted in the annual newsroom census of minority journalists
will most likely provoke a good deal of debate.
</P>
<P>
   Levi Ads Focus on Gay Consumers
</P>
<P>
   Intensifying its efforts to reach younger, more
fashion-conscious consumers, Levi Strauss, the nation's largest
apparel advertiser, is embarking on its most ambitious marketing
campaign aimed at gay men and lesbians. Levi Strauss is one of a
growing number of companies aiming sales pitches at gays and
lesbians for products from cars to computers.

   Congress Rewrites Copyright Law
</P>
<P>
   Congress moved to rewrite U.S. copyright law earlier this month
when it passed two hotly contested pieces of legislation concerning
extended protection for 20th-century cultural icons and
infringement online.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers finished work on a number of other bills affecting the
information technology industry, receiving high marks from the
industry despite failing to act on several pieces of legislation. &QL;

CHINESE MILITARY GAINED IN U.S. EXPORT-POLICY SHIFT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (EDS: Subs to correct Rep. Cox, R-Calif., sted R-S.C. No other
changes.)  (lb) 
 By JEFF GERTH and ERIC SCHMITT    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Shortly after he took office in 1993, President
Clinton traveled to Silicon Valley to lay out his vision of a
robust U.S. economy buoyed by high-technology companies that could
compete anywhere in the world.
</P>
<P>
   The night before his speech, Clinton went out to dinner with two
dozen executives, some of whom complained bitterly about government
rules impeding the overseas sale of computers and other
cutting-edge technologies.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton grabbed a pad, furiously took notes, and promised
relief, one executive recalled.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next five years, the president delivered, personally
presiding over what industry executives and government officials
agree was one of the most sweeping relaxations of export
restrictions in U.S. history.
</P>
<P>
   ``These reforms,'' Clinton said in a 1993 letter detailing the
changes to a leading computer executive, ``can help unleash our
companies to compete successfully in the global market.''
</P>
<P>
   In the years that followed, the new rules helped Clinton fulfill
his vision of a centrist Democratic Party with close ties to U.S.
business. Grateful high-technology companies showered the
Democratic Party with campaign contributions, cementing a new
financial base for a party that has historically struggled to raise
money from corporate America.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials portray the initiatives as one of
Clinton's most lasting legacies, saying it bolstered national
security by helping to make the United States' economy the world's
strongest. The flood of new exports also created high-paying jobs
at home.
</P>
<P>
   But critics, including Republicans in Congress and some former
Clinton administration officials, argue that the high-technology
exports had a serious side effect, strengthening countries like
China, which some view as a potential adversary. Clinton, they
contend, was blinded by his enthusiasm for securing the United
States' global edge and insufficiently attentive to his policies'
effect on long-term U.S. national security.
</P>
<P>
   House and Senate committees are examining whether China took
advantage of the looser rules on exports to enhance its military
and to obtain technology that it passed on to rogue states,
including North Korea. The Senate Intelligence Committee and a
special House panel, which are scheduled to report their findings
in early 1999, have held a series of closed-door hearings this
fall.
</P>
<P>
   An examination by The New York Times of the administration's
export policies on China, based on interviews as well as government
and industry documents, shows that the looser regulations enabled
Chinese companies to obtain a wide range of sophisticated
technology, some of which has already been diverted to military
uses.
</P>
<P>
   The new rules allowed U.S. companies to sell a host of products
without prior government approval, from high-speed computers to
machine tools to communications gear previously subject to
restrictions during the Cold War. While the regulations fostered
trade, they made it much harder for intelligence agencies to track
how U.S. equipment was used overseas, administration officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   Until 1993, most sales to China of goods with possible military
uses required U.S. companies to obtain a government license naming
both the customer and the location in which the equipment would be
installed.
</P>
<P>
   Senior officials acknowledge that Clinton decided to change the
rules without a rigorous review by intelligence officials or other
national security experts.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, CIA analysts wrote a report warning of the military
implications of technology transfers to China, but it never became
an official assessment, because senior aides felt it was ``not well
done and lacked analytical depth,'' a U.S. official said.
</P>
<P>
   The government's last serious examination of technology sales to
China, they said, had been conducted by the Reagan administration
in 1984 at a time when the United States was trying to build up
China as a counterweight against the Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, the Soviet Union has collapsed. And China has been
caught selling missile equipment to nations like Iran and Pakistan
while using its new access to Western technology to expand its
economic and military power.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Wolfowitz, a former official in the State and Defense
departments who participated in the 1984 study, asserted that
international developments since then argue for a tightening of
controls on sales to China, not a loosening.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is an urgent need for a fundamental review of export
policy to China especially because China is in the process of
becoming _ albeit still quite slowly _ the major strategic
competitor and potential threat to the United States and its allies
in the first half of the next century,'' said Wolfowitz, who is
dean of the Paul H. Nitze School of Advanced International Studies
at Johns Hopkins University.
</P>
<P>
   But another China expert sees Beijing's improvement of its
technologically backward military as more benign.
</P>
<P>
   ``Its overall policy is not to be a troublemaker,'' said Doak
Barnett, a professor emeritus at Johns Hopkins, who added that
``gradually building up its defense establishment is something I
would expect it to do, but in my view it's not threatening.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever China's intentions, the Clinton administration over the
last five years has approved export to China of $3 billion in
technology with military or civilian applications, about 5 percent
of overall U.S. sales to China.
</P>
<P>
   A report prepared for the Commerce Department last December
concludes that the administration has little means of knowing
whether this equipment is harming U.S. national security or being
used by Chinese industries to challenge U.S. competitors and jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It may be too late by the time that U.S. industry and/or
government realize there is a problem emerging in either of these
areas,'' the confidential report says.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. intelligence agencies are trying to assess how much the
Chinese military has gained from the imports. Officials say they
have already concluded that China's army gained access to some of
the high-speed computers sold to civilian customers since 1996,
when the rules on computer exports were eased. The officials said
the agencies were unable to assess how the equipment was being
used, because they lacked basic information about the deals.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton administration officials said that the Chinese have
returned the one computer that was improperly diverted and that a
new agreement between the two countries will improve the ability of
U.S. officials to check the whereabouts of equipment exported to
China.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Christopher Cox, R-Calif., who heads the select House panel
on technology transfers to China, said, ``There's always been a
tension within the government about which exports are proper.''
</P>
<P>
   But, he added, ``these days without question the overriding
impulse to sell, sell, sell is in the ascendancy.''

<P>
   The Old System
</P>
<P>
   Cold War Rules Get New Scrutiny
</P>
<P>
   The United States and its Western allies zealously guarded their
technological edge during the Cold War, forbidding the sale to
communist-bloc nations of any item with a conceivable military use.
Military contractors did not chafe too much under the restrictions,
because the Pentagon had a seemingly limitless budget for their
wares.
</P>
<P>
   In 1983, Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping complained bitterly about
the restrictions on technology exports, prompting the Reagan
administration to ease some of the rules for China. It was seen in
the United States' interest, Wolfowitz recently told Congress, to
help Beijing develop the military muscle needed to counter the
``formidable threat'' from the Soviet Union. In addition, he said,
China had been helpful in arming the Afghan rebels.
</P>
<P>
   The United States, however, maintained tight controls over what
he termed the most sensitive technologies _ those that could
improve China's missiles or anti-submarine capabilities.
</P>
<P>
   The fall of communism brought a precipitous drop in the Pentagon
budget, prompting the defense industry to scramble for new markets.
Companies that once made spy satellites for U.S. spy agencies began
making equipment for cellular networks that served China or Russia.
</P>
<P>
   They quickly confronted a significant obstacle to making money
on sales to former adversaries. The Cold War-era rules remained
largely in effect, and they were being interpreted by career
officials who had devoted their lives to blocking exports to Russia
and its allies.
</P>
<P>
   Enter Bill Clinton. His 1992 campaign had been driven by the
slogan ``It's the economy, stupid.'' Aides say Clinton's views on
foreign policy were framed by his experiences as a governor of
Arkansas, a poor state that looked overseas for investments and
markets, and he arrived in Washington determined to expand trade.
</P>
<P>
   In an immediate sign of this policy's political importance,
Clinton sent the Democratic Party's chief fund-raiser, Ron Brown,
to take over the Commerce Department, which promotes U.S. exports.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon was traditionally the strongest voice against
technology exports, and Clinton made several appointments
calculated to change the culture.
</P>
<P>
   William Perry, an executive at a Silicon Valley company who was
vocally opposed to the existing system of export controls, was
named deputy defense secretary and then defense secretary. John
Deutch, a professor with similar views, was named to a senior post
at the Pentagon, and then became director of central intelligence.
</P>
<P>
   Perry, testifying at his confirmation hearing to be deputy
defense secretary, told senators in February 1993 that controlling
dual-use technology is ``a hopeless task.'' He continued, ``It only
interferes with our companies' ability to succeed internationally
if we try to impose all sorts of controls in that area.''
</P>
<P>
   Perry said ``we really need to bear down'' on controlling the
most critical components necessary to build weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton took a personal interest in the new policy. Shortly
after he returned from his foray to Silicon Valley, he spelled out
his intentions in a letter to Edward McCracken, the chief executive
officer of computer maker Silicon Graphics. Company officials had
complained to Clinton over dinner about export rules.
</P>
<P>
   ``One reason I ran for president was to tailor export controls
to the realization of a post-Cold War world,'' Clinton wrote.
</P>
<P>
   After noting the need to retain strong controls in some areas to
combat the spread of nuclear, chemical and biological weapons,
Clinton detailed his intention to ``unleash our companies to
compete successfully in the global market.'' The United States, he
said, would slash red tape and loosen controls on the overseas sale
of computers, telecommunication equipment and machine-making tools.
</P>
<P>
   The New System
</P>
<P>
   Relaxed Rules Benefit Chinese
</P>
<P>
   Those restrictions were an integral part of the Cold War. For
decades, every proposed export of technology was weighed by a
committee of Western nations. It had authority to block sales
involving military hardware or so-called ``dual-use'' equipment
that had military or civilian applications.
</P>
<P>
   Even before the committee disbanded in 1994, the Clinton
administration moved to ease restrictions on the sales of many
dual-use items. The new rules allowed companies to export many
categories of technology without applying for a government license.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. companies were delighted with the new system, which
relieved them of a time-consuming and frustrating process. But the
benefits came with a cost. Because sales could be made without
export licenses, the government and its intelligence agencies no
longer had a record of many deals that involved dual-use equipment.
There was no way to trace patterns of sales _ to know, for example,
how many decoding devices were being sold to a particular country.
</P>
<P>
   Commerce Department internal documents show that China has been
a major beneficiary of this policy. According to a 1995 estimate,
more than $1.9 billion in annual trade with China had been removed
from federal scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
   A ban remains in effect on the sale to China of the most
militarily potent technologies, like ballistic missiles, spy
satellites and advanced fighter aircraft. Beijing buys those
weapons from Russia, Europe and Israel.
</P>
<P>
   ``China has benefited more than any other country from U.S.
decontrols on certain dual-use commodities enacted in late 1993 and
early 1994,'' one Commerce Department document says. ``There has
been a 60 percent decrease in the number of individual export
licenses required for trade with China (from 2,229 in 1993 to only
925 in 1994).''
</P>
<P>
   The rules shifted much of the burden for controlling exports to
the companies making the deals.
</P>
<P>
   Previously, the applications for licenses to sell sophisticated
electronic equipment overseas were scrutinized by Pentagon and
intelligence analysts. One crucial question was whether the
customer was really a ``front'' for military users barred from
buying such equipment.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration's new policy relied on industry
executives to raise questions about their own sales. They were
required to seek a Commerce Department license only if they
believed the equipment would end up in military hands.
</P>
<P>
   Aerospace officials say they are ill equipped to make such
evaluations.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the administration began making public the names of
questionable customers, to warn exporters. But industry officials
said the list of about a dozen nuclear-production facilities was a
tiny slice of what was available and ignored entities involved in
missile activity.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is particularly acute, industry executives said,
when the deals involved China, where the military has long played a
role in commercial ventures and where it is difficult to
distinguish between military officers' personal and professional
dealings.
</P>
<P>
   One of the first deals under the new rules, a 1994 sale of
telecommunications equipment to China, illustrates the
complexities. The Commerce Department's decision to allow such
exports without a license made it easier for AT&AMP;T and other U.S.
companies to sell hundreds of millions of dollars in sophisticated
equipment to Chinese companies building civil telecommunication
networks.
</P>
<P>
   An examination of the deal by the General Accounting Office, the
audit arm of Congress, found that the equipment was sold to a
Chinese-U.S. joint venture, Hua Mei, ``without Commerce review,
even though the company was partially controlled by several
high-level members of the Chinese military.''
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T officials in turn told the audit agency that ``they did not
ask the Commerce Department to determine if Hua Mei was a civil end
user, nor were they required to.''
</P>
<P>
   It is not known whether the company has put the equipment to
military use. But Pentagon officials told the GAO that in 1994,
China's army was seeking to buy this same type of technology, as it
moved to improve its communications networks.
</P>
<P>
   The Reassessment
</P>
<P>
   A Computer Sale Sets Off Alarms
</P>
<P>
   By 1995, the Pentagon was urging Congress to look more closely
at export policy. Military officials noted that the effect of
technology was cumulative, and that while individual sales might
appear benign, a combination of cutting-edge acquisitions would
allow an adversary to build much better bombs or radars.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, documents show, was moving in the opposite direction.
</P>
<P>
   According to a 1995 Commerce Department document, the president
``made clear,'' in private conversations he had with Brown, that
``he does not believe we have done enough to streamline and
liberalize.''
</P>
<P>
   The document mapped out how Brown should lobby high-level
administration officials to ease controls on computer exports and
shift items like communications satellites, engine technology and
commercial data-scrambling devices. Such items were on a list of
equipment that required a State Department license, and companies
believed they could close more deals if authority over the exports
were moved to Brown's Commerce Department.
</P>
<P>
   Their enthusiasm for the Commerce Department was well grounded.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to proposed sales of an item regulated by the
State Department, the Pentagon holds a virtual veto, a privilege it
exercised regularly during the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
   The Commerce Department is responsible for promoting U.S.
exports. When it weighs an overseas deal, the Pentagon has only one
vote out of five agencies, and the right to appeal if its
objections are overruled, which has been rarely used.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Warren Christopher insisted that his
department retain jurisdiction. He was overruled in early 1996 by
Clinton, opening the way to billions of dollars of satellite sales
to Chinese companies.
</P>
<P>
   At about the same time, the administration was weighing whether
to lift restrictions on the export of some advanced computers.
Officials asked outside consultants to study the issue, and they
came back with a report that asserted the controls were pointless.
The powerful computers manufactured by U.S. companies would soon be
widely available from foreign competitors, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   The administration asked the consultants to assess whether
computer sales could pose a threat to the U.S. military. Their
report did not take a position, saying the government did not have
enough information to draw a conclusion.
</P>
<P>
   This left the issue to Clinton, who decided to fulfill his
pledge to the Silicon Valley executives and relax the restrictions.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president made a judgment on what the threat was, and the
president's judgment was reflected in his decision,'' said William
Reinsch, undersecretary of commerce for export administration. The
new rules took effect early in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after, Chinese companies bought 77 of the high-speed
computers, which can be used to predict weather patterns but can
also scramble secret communications or design powerful nuclear
weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Disclosure of those sales prompted Congress to reinstate license
requirements for some advanced computers.
</P>
<P>
   This year, the CIA and other federal agencies concluded that at
least some of those computers are now being used by China's
military. The details of their use remain unclear, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   A review by the GAO last month called into question the
administration's basic assumptions in lifting the controls on
computers. Contrary to what the consultants said in their report,
the international market for advanced computers remains strongly
dominated by U.S. companies.
</P>
<P>
   Congress acted after The New York Times reported that two U.S.
aerospace companies were under investigation to determine whether
they went too far in sharing rocket technology with Chinese
scientists seeking to determine the causes of a failed satellite
launch in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The inquiry, which continues, has since been broadened to
include a failed launch in 1995. Rocket technology for ballistic
missiles is similar to that used to send satellites into orbit.
Both companies have denied wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   Just this month, Congress reversed Clinton's 1996 decision and
returned satellite exports to the State Department. At the same
time, lawmakers created a new senior Pentagon position for
technology security after concluding that military officials' role
in controlling exports to countries like China had been
``significantly and improperly reduced over the years.''

<P>
   The Fallout
</P>
<P>
   Report Cites a Loss of Oversight Role
</P>
<P>
   The military significance of the United States' exports to China
is hotly debated.
</P>
<P>
   China's army is in the throes of modernization. For now, Beijing
is more of a regional power than a global threat.
</P>
<P>
   A commission headed by former Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld
concluded in July that the looser controls on exports, coupled with
lax enforcement, had increased the possibility that rogue nations
like Iran or North Korea would build ballistic missiles that could
hit the United States.
</P>
<P>
   China ``poses a threat to the United States'' by supplying
technology to these pariah states, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   Commission members said they were startled at how much the
government had freed the export of dual-use technology and how
little U.S. officials could do to track its use or ensure that it
was not diverted to terrorists or foreign militaries.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's particularly troubling,'' said James Woolsey, a
commission member who was Clinton's first director of central
intelligence, ``is that the massive decontrol in the last few years
of the export of dual-use technology in general, and specifically
to China, has made it almost impossible for the U.S. to monitor
where such technology has gone, much less exercise any control over
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Another commission member, Barry Blechman, said technology
transfer ``is a central reason why we reached our conclusion.''
</P>
<P>
   Blechman is president of DFI International, the Washington
consulting firm that prepared a confidential report for the
Commerce Department in December on technology transfers to China.
</P>
<P>
   The report concludes that China does not currently pose a direct
threat to U.S. competitiveness in high technology. But it might in
the future, especially in areas like electronics, which by 1996 had
become China's top export back to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Then Clinton's policy might wind up being turned upside down,
with China jeopardizing the same high-paying jobs that Clinton used
to justify increasing exports to China.
</P>
<P>
   According to the report, the concern is that ``as Chinese
manufacturing becomes more sophisticated and technical in nature''
_ thanks in part to U.S. and Western exports of that technology _
``Chinese high-tech products could potentially undercut such
products (and therefore jobs as well.)''

U.S. MAY FIGHT NORTHWEST DEAL FOR CONTINENTAL 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb)

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Talks between the Clinton administration and Northwest Airlines
ended inconclusively Sunday, with lawyers for the airline unable to
overcome the administration's objections to Northwest's bid to buy
a controlling stake in Continental Airlines, participants said.
</P>
<P>
   According to one account, the antitrust division of the Justice
Department has until the end of Monday to file suit to block the
deal, which has had a big impact on the domestic airline industry
since it was announced in January. But one person close to the
negotiations said that the government had some wiggle room and
assured Northwest on Sunday that it would not take action Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The government has received several extensions from Northwest
since it began reviewing the deal earlier this year, but the
airline recently declined to give the government more time to force
it to make a decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``In many ways it is up to Justice,'' a second person who was
briefed on the negotiations said Sunday. ``If they wanted to be
super conservative, they would file tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials at the Justice Department declined to comment, as did
spokesmen for Northwest and Continental.
</P>
<P>
   Northwest, the United States' fourth-largest carrier, aims to
acquire a majority stake in Continental, the fifth-largest carrier,
from a Texas investment group for $311 million plus 4.1 million
shares of Northwest stock. The two carriers intend to enter into a
broad alliance, combining frequent-flier plans and selling seats on
each other's flights while maintaining separate managements, boards
and employees.
</P>
<P>
   The so-called virtual merger touched off a series of deals among
the other large airlines, though none involved the purchase of an
equity stake, which requires government approval. United, the
nation's largest carrier, entered into an alliance with Delta Air
Lines, the third-largest, while No. 2 American Airlines linked up
with U S Airways.
</P>
<P>
   The alliances were announced at a time when concern in
Washington about the power of the big airlines to dominate major
airports was already on the rise. Earlier this year, the
Transportation Department proposed a series of guidelines designed
to prevent larger carriers from preying on smaller airlines.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department has also been investigating several
carriers, including Northwest, for antitrust violations, while
several bills designed to promote more airline competition were
introduced in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Because the other alliances were formed in response to the
Northwest-Continental proposal, whatever action the government
takes will affect not only that deal but the others as well.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, United and Delta abandoned their plan to sell
seats on each others' domestic flights, because of objections by
Delta's pilots. But last week, Gerald Greenwald, United's chairman
and chief executive, said that the carriers would seriously
consider reviving their proposal if the Northwest-Continental deal
went forward.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this is approved, we are going to have all the airlines
trying to emulate it as much as possible,'' Kevin Mitchell,
chairman of the Business Travel Coalition, which lobbies on behalf
of several large corporations, said Sunday.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Mitchell, who argues that the deal would hurt competition, added
that the Justice Department asked him to give his opinion in a
formal statement, which he said they were planning to include in
their lawsuit should they move to block the transaction.
</P>
<P>
   Northwest has said that it will put its Continental shares in a
trust controlled by a slate of independent directors and has vowed
not to buy any more Continental stock. But the government is not
satisfied with the trust, which expires after six years.
</P>
<P>
   If the government does go to court, Northwest and Continental
could decide to walk away from the deal. But a person with
knowledge of their plans said that they were determined to fight,
because they are convinced the government has a weak case.
</P>
<P>
   ``They run substantial risk of losing should they bring their
case,'' the person said of the Justice Department. ``They are on
weak legal and factual ground, and they don't have an economic
case.''

IN SANTIAGO, NEWS OF PINOCHET'S ARREST STIRS ONLY SMALL PROTEST
</HEADLINE>
   (See also PINOCHET-CHILE, PINOCHET-BRITAIN, PINOCHET-LAW,
PINOCHET-JUDGE.)

<P>
   SANTIAGO, Chile _ Perhaps as a sign of how much Chileans wish to
forget their years of polarized politics and repression under Gen.
Augusto Pinochet, the immediate popular response here to the
sensational news of his arrest in London has been remarkable for
its moderation.
</P>
<P>
   About 200 supporters of the retired dictator gathered at the
residence of the British ambassador on Saturday evening to protest
the arrest, some throwing fruit and eggs at the building.
</P>
<P>
   Some demonstrators burned a British flag in front of the nearby
residence of the Spanish ambassador before the police arrived in a
truck with water cannon, at which point the protesters obediently
withdrew.
</P>
<P>
   Chilean television news repeatedly showed the same videotape of
a leftist counterdemonstrator in heated discussions with the
protesting Pinochet supporters before he was arrested and carried
kicking and screaming into a police van.
</P>
<P>
   But in a display of uncensored political debate that would have
been unthinkable only a decade ago under the general's rule,
television broadcasts also showed myriad reactions to the arrest
from political figures ranging from Communist Party leaders to
rightist retired generals.
</P>
<P>
   Many Chileans still harbor bitter memories of Pinochet's
dictatorial ways, including the deaths and disappearances of more
than 3,000 people in the 17 years that followed his violent
overthrow of the elected Socialist government of President Salvador
Allende in 1973.
</P>
<P>
   But most political analysts say a large majority wants to put
the era of radical politics and repression behind it, a trend
equally apparent in neighboring Argentina and Brazil, which also
went through periods of rule by military juntas.
</P>
<P>
   President Eduardo Frei Ruiz-Tagle, in Portugal for a summit
meeting of Iberian and Latin American leaders, charged that Britain
was breaking international law, saying that Pinochet, now an
unelected senator for life, carried a diplomatic passport giving
him legal immunity.
</P>
<P>
   Frei leads a governing coalition that includes Christian
Democrats and Socialists, and his strong defense of the general's
rights was only one of a string of similar comments from civilian
politicians who have spent most of their political careers opposing
Pinochet.
</P>
<P>
   Only one presidential candidate in next year's elections
expressed support for the Spanish and British actions, and that was
Gladys Marin of the Communist Party. ``I couldn't be more happy,''
she told local television. ``This government has been unwilling to
bring this genocidal criminal to justice over the last eight years,
so it is up to the Spanish to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   The leading leftist candidate, Ricardo Lagos of the Socialist
Party, was far more cautious. Lagos gently scolded Pinochet for not
anticipating his arrest abroad but said he did want to get involved
in a judicial matter. Effectively, Lagos was walking a tight line
in order to deflect conservatives' claims that his election would
return Chile to the political and economic turbulence of Allende's
abbreviated rule.
</P>
<P>
   The two leading conservative candidates predictably criticized
the arrest, and some rightist politicians urged the government to
break relations with London in protest.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of Pinochet pledged to mobilize street demonstrations
demanding his release, while the Communist Party and human rights
groups promised marches supporting the British action and a
possible Spanish prosecution for alleged crimes against humanity.
</P>
<P>
   But Sunday was just another Sunday for most Chileans, who packed
Santiago's parks on a splendidly sunny spring day. A few lightly
armed police officers directed traffic away from the British and
Spanish embassies, and flimsy three-feet high wire fences were
placed around the buildings.
</P>
<P>
   Attempting to explain the calm, Mireya Garcia, secretary general
of the Group of the Families of the Detained and Disappeared, said:
``After 25 years of absolute impunity for violators of human
rights, it takes a while for the people to absorb this news and
understand its importance and dimensions.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   For all the normalcy, the arrest of Pinochet opened a revealing
window into a new Chilean society, one run by democratically
elected civilians side-by-side with a still influential military.
President Fidel Castro of Cuba, who for years was portrayed as the
devil incarnate in the Chilean media, was shown on television in a
very human light, reacting to the arrest with confused amusement.
</P>
<P>
   News clips of Chilean exiles celebrating the arrest received
prominent play. Their shouts of ``murderer'' and posters of the
former dictator bearing the word ``Wanted'' were broadcast on the
same show that included an interview with Augusto Pinochet Hiriart,
Pinochet's son.
</P>
<P>
   ``Countries have lost wars and committed real genocide,'' he
said, ``but that is not what happened here.''

SERBS PULLING OUT OF KOSOVO AT A SLOW PACE 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Yugoslavia has begun to withdraw two army and
police battalions from Kosovo in what NATO and Clinton
administration officials described Sunday as a significant step by
President Slobodan Milosevic toward complying with demands to end
his campaign against Kosovo's ethnic Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   But the officials said they remained concerned about the pace
with which Milosevic's government is abiding by the agreement,
which was brokered last week under the threat of NATO strikes
against Yugoslav military and police forces.
</P>
<P>
   The officials said NATO's supreme commander, Gen. Wesley Clark,
would fly to Yugoslavia's capital, Belgrade, on Tuesday to deliver
yet another stern message to Milosevic that he must comply with
international demands.
</P>
<P>
   Last week NATO voted to authorize the use of force against
Yugoslavia, but on Friday the alliance extended the initial
deadline it had given Milosevic to comply. The deadline, which was
to have expired early Saturday morning, was extended by 10 days
until Oct. 27 because, the officials said, there were indications
that Milosevic was complying with at least some of the demands to
end the fighting.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Holbrooke, the U.S. envoy to the Balkans who brokered
the agreement, said Sunday that NATO had not backed down but rather
kept up the pressure. ``NATO didn't blink,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Holbrooke, appearing on the ABC News program ``This Week,'' said
NATO was still ready to use force, if necessary. ``The Serbs fully
know the consequences if they don't comply, and this is not a
bluff,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In Kosovo, the first significant withdrawals of Yugoslav forces
began after Friday's extension, according to NATO officials, who
have closely monitored the troop levels through satellite imagery
and other intelligence means, including reports from witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   A senior NATO official said Sunday that the Yugoslav Army's
211th Armored Brigade, with 300 to 400 soldiers, had withdrawn from
the Podujevo area and returned to Serbia, the republic that
dominates Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   The 3rd Military Police Battalion, part of the paramilitary
forces Milosevic wielded in his campaign, also left its position
near Urosevac, south of Kosovo's capital, Pristina. But the
official said it was not yet clear that those forces, also 300 to
400 strong, had left Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Those two battalions were among seven that Clark demanded be
withdrawn during a meeting with Milosevic in Belgrade on Thursday.
There is no sign so far that Milosevic has made any effort to
withdraw the other five battalions on Clark's list.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got to step it up,'' the senior NATO official said of
Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   NATO has insisted that Yugoslavia withdraw 4,000 to 5,000 army
troops and 3,000 to 4,000 paramilitary troops involved in the
crackdown, which ostensibly targeted rebels fighting for Kosovo's
independence but spread to attacks on civilians and their villages.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Under last week's agreement, Yugoslavia would still keep 12,500
soldiers and 6,000 police officers in the province. But
administration and NATO officials said they hoped the increased
international presence brought by the deal will prevent a renewal
of the fighting.
</P>
<P>
   Under the agreement, Milosevic agreed to unarmed reconnaissance
flights over Kosovo. On Saturday and again on Sunday, a U.S. U-2
spy plane flew over the province, collecting thousands of
photographs of both troop concentrations and refugees who have fled
to the mountains to avoid the fighting.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic also agreed to allow international observers from the
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe into Kosovo.
The first of those observers arrived over the weekend, and Russia
announced on Sunday that it would contribute 200 people to the
mission. But it could take weeks before enough arrive to verify
that Milosevic's forces have ended their campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am worried that the international community will be too slow
in getting them there and that they will take six months to get
there, when we need them there in six days, or at least six
weeks,'' Holbrooke said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Armed clashes continued over the weekend between Serb forces and
ethnic Albanian rebels whose insurgency sparked Milosevic's
crackdown. Three Serb police officers were reported killed and two
wounded in a grenade attack near the town of Lapusnick on Saturday.
Yugoslav officials have complained that the attacks prove the
rebels are not interested in reaching a settlement to the conflict.

 &HT;    Padres fans, team still love Leyritz
 &HT;    By I.J.Rosenberg
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ One of the big stories over the weekend here was Jim
Leyritz's return to the Big Apple. It was the Padres catcher, then
playing for the Yankees back in 1996, that turned around the World
Series with a Game 4 homer off Mark Wohlers.
</P>
<P>
   A hero then, they still love Leyritz here and he continues to
spend a lot of time with the fans as for both games he took the
subway from his hotel in midtown Manhattan instead of the cozy team
bus.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love it here,'' Leyritz said. ``People ask me whey I don't
take a taxi or limousine, but I like the subway. It makes me feel
like part of the city.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the weather again
</P>
<P>
   As he was in the postseason last year, Padres righthander Kevin
Brown is sick again. He got a head cold Friday and was immediately
put on antibiotics, pitching into the seventh inning Saturday
night. ``I never should have opened my mouth,'' Brown said. ``I
never should have said I was healthy. Someone's got a voodoo doll
working on me I guess. I was struggling all night. Physically, I
was not there. I have pitched in three World Series games and have
not been healthy yet.'' If the Padres are down in the series, Brown
will likely pitch in Game 4 on Tuesday on just three days' rest.''
</P>
<P>
   Braves getting ripped
</P>
<P>
   The national media continues its criticizing of the Braves, some
even calling for the job of manager Bobby Cox. On Sunday, Mike
Lupica of the New York Daily News wrote: ``Bobby Cox has done more
dumb squeezing than Bill Clinton. Cox has to go now, by the way. He
goes for a lot of reasons, but mostly because he only won once with
the Atlanta Braves in the 1990s and while winning once was more
than the Buffalo Bills ever did, it wasn't nearly enough.'' Lupica
goes on to add: ``The Braves are the ones that should hire Davey
Johnson.'' In the New York Times Sunday, a headline ran that said:
Braves May Have Rotation Fear, but in Playoffs It Isn't Enough.''
The story goes on to quote a general manager who said on the
condition of anonymity: ``They're not that good a club if you take
away their starting pitching. If you put their starting pitching on
several National League clubs, those clubs would be better.''
</P>
<P>
   Around the horn
</P>
<P>
   Yankees manager Joe Torre on Tino Martinez's grand slam in Game
1: Even with Tino struggling, we still got into the World Series.
We feel like we had something in the bank coming from them.'' ...
Before the opening game, Yankees rookie Ricky Ledee went up to
Torre and thanked him for putting him in the lineup. Ledee
responded with a 2-for-3 night and a walk and drove in two runs.
... Chuck Knobluach's homer Saturday was the first for a second
baseman in the Series since Tony Phillips went deep for Oakland in
1989. ... One more win and Yankees lefthander David Wells will set
a record for the postseason. He is 4-0. ... San Diego's Tony Gwynn
on the Yankee Stadium crowd: ``A Yankees crowd has chants that seem
like the whole crowd is in ... On Martinez's ball (slam), I could
barely hear myself breathing.'' ... Yankees legend Joe DiMaggio
from a hospital bed in Florida had this message for the current
Bombers: ``Win one for the Clipper.''

   NATIONAL FORECAST
</P>
<P>
   A cold front heralding a return to more seasonable weather will
sweep through the Northeast early Monday with nothing more than
some sprinkles and gusty winds. Returning sunshine along the coast
will combine with dry winds descending the Appalachians to raise
afternoon readings more than 10 degrees above normal. However,
temperatures will slip back to seasonal levels Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   As cooler air pushes into the mountains of New England, a few
showers will develop Monday afternoon. A second surge of much
cooler weather will trigger widespread showers in the northern and
central Great Lakes. Funnel clouds are possible as the coolest air
of the season passes over the unusually warm northern Lakes.
</P>
<P>
   Very warm air will cover the Southeast with near record highs in
the southern Appalachians. A cold front will stall as it moves into
the Gulf States. Some showers will dampen the region from eastern
Tennessee to Louisiana. A large disturbance in the northwest
Caribbean should bring clouds and some rain to south Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Heavy showers will linger over southernmost Texas, but drier and
cooler air will push into the northern half of the state. A return
air flow from the southeast will ascend the southern Rockies
causing clouds and rain to develop. Tropical moisture from a
Pacific hurricane may be drawn into the southern Rockies as a weak
disturbance develops over California.
</P>
<P>
   High pressure stretching from the Plains northwest to British
Columbia will keep much of the West dry with chilly nights and
warmer days. Offshore winds will bring warmth to northern
California.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: The Flooded Alamo
</P>
<P>
   A deluge on San Antonio during Saturday brought 11.26 inches of
rain to the city, setting a record for the wettest day ever and
making this the soggiest October on record. The monthly tally
reached over 16 inches by daybreak Sunday pushing this month into
first place for the wettest month. A slow-moving cold front became
the focal point of heavy thunderstorms as the front finally stalled
over the hill country of south Texas. A plume of high- level
moisture from hurricane Madeline near Baja California streamed over
Mexico and added to the potent thunderstorms in south Texas.

 &HT;    Three men shot execution-style at hotel
 &HT;    By Kathy Scruggs and Craig Schneider
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Three men were found shot to death execution-style
Sunday morning in a hotel room at the downtown Atlanta Hilton and
Towers just off Peachtree Street, police said.
</P>
<P>
   A hotel maid discovered the grisly scene in a 24th-floor room
about 8 a.m., police said. The three men had not been tied or
bound, but had been forced to the floor and shot _ probably at
point-blank range _ in the head, police said. The victims, two
white men and one African-American man, were killed between
midnight and 8 a.m., said Atlanta police Deputy Chief C.B. Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this point in the investigation, these murders do not
appear to be a random act,'' said Atlanta police Maj. Mickey Lloyd.
``The evidence on the scene apears to show that it was an
execution-style event. All indications are that this appeared to
have been a planned act. We're looking at narcotics as a possible
motive, but we're not closing the door on anything at this pont.''
</P>
<P>
   The killings occurred on the last day of a special promotion
called the Atlanta Homecoming Weekend, which was sponsored by the
Atlanta Convention and Visitors Bureau. The effort provided
discounts to local residents who stayed at downtown hotels.
</P>
<P>
   Spurgeon Richardson, president of the visitors bureau, said
tourism business likely won't be affected if the victims were
involved in illegal behavior such as drug-dealing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Meeting planners understand that while it's unfortunate,
drug-related crime can happen anywhere in the country,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Hilton did its best to keep the triple slaying from
upsetting guests. Bellhops still greeted people at the front door
of the skyscraper on Cortland Street, though security was
increased. Reporters were escorted into one second-floor room. The
van that picked up the bodies did so behind a closed garage door.
Hotel operators still answered calls with, ``It's a great day at
Hilton Atlanta.''
</P>
<P>
   The killings happened on a night when the hotel was about 55
percent occupied, officials said. Guests ranged from computer
conventioneers from New Jersey, to postal workers visiting from
Texas, to a wildlife official from Kenya, here to study Zoo
Atlanta. People also were in town to see the Falcons-Saints game
and Georgia Tech's homecoming game Saturday against the University
of Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   Lloyd said the three dead men were not thought to be college
students or tourists in town for a sporting event.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to stress that this was not someone coming in off the
streets of Atlanta and killing three people,'' Lloyd said. ``It's a
terrible thing to have happened, but I don't believe all the
security in the world could have prevented it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The shootings were carried out in a very methodical manner.''
Lloyd said.
</P>
<P>
   Hotel security was quick to let guests know the deaths were not
believed to be random killings. Still, the triple murder shocked
many guests.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of horrifying,'' said Tom Coppeto, 31, in town for a
computer conference.
</P>
<P>
   By Sunday evening, only one of the men has been tentatively
identified through the hotel registration, Lloyd said. His name has
not been released because his family has not been notified. Police
had not yet verified the names of the other two, Lloyd said.
</P>
<P>
   Detectives, along with the Georgia Bureau of Investigation's
crime scene technicians, were expected to investigate at the hotel
through the night. Autopsies on the three men will be conducted
today.

 &HT;    Padres advantage becoming an obstacle
 &HT;    By I.J. Rosenberg
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A shaky bullpen can destroy a team in the postseason.
Just ask the Braves.
</P>
<P>
   But what was supposed to be their big strength for the Padres is
quickly turning into their stumbling block.
</P>
<P>
   The problems for the San Diego pen started in the league
championship against Atlanta and came to a head in Game 1 of the
World Series Saturday when their relievers gave up a game-tying,
three-run home run to the Chuck Knoblauch in the seventh inning and
a what turned out to the game-winning runs on a grand slam to Tino
Martinez.
</P>
<P>
   This can turn a Series around quickly and certainly gave the
Yankees the momentum going into Game 2.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think last night was indicative of how I feel about my
bullpen,'' Padres manager Bruce Bochy said. ``I have a lot of
confidence in them. That is why we stuck with the guys that got us
here.''
</P>
<P>
   Some feel Bochy pulled starter Kevin Brown too early in Game 1
as Donnie Wall came in with one out and two runners on in the
seventh to give up the long ball to Knoblauch.
</P>
<P>
   ``Donne Wall, he was the guy that we brought in that kind of
situation,'' Bochy said. ``That is what we wanted to do for this
series. Dan Miceli normally pitches the eighth inning and (Randy)
Myers is there to help him out depending on who is coming up. So I
still have confidence in these guys.''
</P>
<P>
   One of San Diego's problems is Miceli appears to have a dead
arm.
</P>
<P>
   ``He did have a little arm fatigue there in the Atlanta
series,'' Bochy said. ``So instead of breaking him out last night
in that situation, Donne, you know, had felt good all along, so we
went with Donne there. But Dan is fine to go.''
</P>
<P>
   Another problem the Padres are having are getting to closer
Trevor Hoffman, who has been the one consistent force this
postseason for San Diego. But while the Padres bullpen continues to
stumble, New York relievers have almost been perfect, especially
closer Mariano Rivera, who know has xx saves this postseason and
has not allowed a run in xx innings.
</P>
<P>
   Bochy says it is very difficult to get something going against
Rivera. In Game 1, the righthander faced five hitters, getting four
outs and the other being an error by second baseman Chuck
Knoblauch.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a challenge,'' Bochy said. ``He has got great stuff and
he is pitching very well now.''

OUT WEST, COLLEGE FOOTBALL IS STILL FUN 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Ore., Texas)  (Eds: Scheduled earlier as FBC-COLLEGE-RANKING) 
(mk) 
 By JOE DRAPE    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ In the Midwest or South, 79 points and 985
yards of total offense usually mean that Ohio State or Florida has
rolled over some hapless nonconference opponent. Out West, it gets
you UCLA out-high-wiring Oregon in overtime Saturday night, 41-38,
in the most thrilling game of the season thus far.
</P>
<P>
   Theirs was only the headline act of a weekend in which poll
watching and Heisman Trophy handicapping finally lost out to good
old, mystifying fun. How to explain Temple, without a victory
entering the game, upsetting unbeaten Virginia Tech, 28-24, behind
a freshman quarterback who was making his first start? Or Tulane
running its record to 5-0 against Louisville in a game in which the
teams' quarterbacks combined for 750 passing yards?
</P>
<P>
   Even top-ranked Ohio State _ which along with Kansas State leads
the nation in winning-but-joyless football _ got a little crazy.
Woody Hayes' three yards and a cloud of dust gave way to Joe
Germaine throwing 39 times for 339 yards in a 45-15 pasting of
Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   But breathless good times and highlight-reel finishes have been
the norm here on the left edge of the nation. Unfortunately, on the
East Coast only insomniacs have been able to see two of the best
finishes of this college season, both of which occurred at night on
the West Coast.
</P>
<P>
   In the opening week, it was Washington's Brock Huard who tossed
a 63-yard touchdown pass on fourth-and-17 in the final seconds to
beat Arizona State. Two weeks ago, the Huskies had their hearts
broken when Arizona quarterback Ortege Jenkins executed a full
somersault over two defenders and landed on his feet in the end
zone in the closing seconds to give the Wildcats a victory.
</P>
<P>
   At least the Bruins-Ducks game on Saturday started at 3:30 p.m.
New York time _ though ABC Sports, sticking to its regional format,
did not broadcast the fun nationally. What those Easterners who
were without pay-per-view or didn't buy the game missed was seeing
UCLA looking like a blockbuster team and quarterback Cade McNown
looking like a Heisman-caliber star in building a 24-7 first-half
lead.
</P>
<P>
   Then McNown threw two interceptions and threw up, literally, at
midfield of the Rose Bowl, and the Ducks took a fourth-quarter,
31-24 lead. All that was a buildup to the final 2 minutes 40
seconds of regulation, which saw UCLA score twice and Oregon once.
</P>
<P>
   In that span, Oregon fumbled, McNown threw a 60-yard touchdown
pass and the Ducks' Akili Smith answered with a 65-yard touchdown
drive. Smith capped it with a 2-yard scoring toss.
</P>
<P>
   But the Bruins weren't done. McNown threw a 53-yard pass to the
3-yard line that was caught by his backup Drew Bennett, who was put
in the game at receiver because he could jump. Then UCLA missed a
field goal on the final play of regulation. Oh yeah, and then
overtime.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a lot of fun, don't we?'' the Bruins' Danny Farmer
said with a smile. Farmer caught two touchdown passes from McNown _
including the 60-yarder _ and already has a national championship:
in volleyball, as a middle blocker for UCLA. ``You know, we don't
get the recognition we deserve,'' Farmer said. ``But it's good ball
out here.''
</P>
<P>
   It is indeed. In the last 10 Rose Bowls, in which the Big Ten
champions hold a 6-4 edge over the Pacific 10 champions, all have
been competitive, with the exception of Washington's 34-14 victory
over Michigan in 1992. Better, because of the region's isolation
from the rest of the country's news media outlets, there's a
looser, more _ well, collegiate spirit to football here.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA coach Bob Toledo spoke with relish before the game about
``lights in the scoreboard burning out.'' When they did, and he
escaped with the victory despite his team's sloppy play as well as
his own bad decision that could have cost him the game, he was
smiling and exuded utter rapture. When asked why he didn't call one
of his three remaining timeouts to allow his kicker time to set up
for the 21-yarder that ended regulation, he said with a smile: ``I
was tired. I wanted the game to end.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Chris Sailer hurried his boot and missed left.
</P>
<P>
   Compare Toledo's response to Steve Spurrier's lament after
Florida eked out a 16-10 victory over Alabama recently: ``The
Gators don't play like champions anymore.'' Or the increasingly
dour demeanor of Ohio State's John Cooper despite guiding the
nation's most dominant team. Out West, no one feels the weight of
the polls.
</P>
<P>
   The same isn't true, however, of the Heisman race. A sad
byproduct of the hype surrounding the trophy is that the nation's
two best candidate's are convinced that they don't have a shot at
it. They are also hurt that their campaigns have sparked negative
comments.
</P>
<P>
   Texas' Ricky Williams needs 703 yards, or an average of 140.6 in
his remaining five games, to break Tony Dorsett's NCAA career
rushing record. He is the best running back in the nation and an
even worthier recipient off the field. Last week, for example, he
wore No. 37 _ Doak Walker's number _ against Oklahoma at the Cotton
Bowl. It was a tribute to Walker, the former Heisman winner, who
had befriended Williams before his recent death.
</P>
<P>
   Williams believes the Heisman goes to the best player on the
best team and has prepared himself to be snubbed because Texas
(4-2) is rebuilding and has not been on television very much.
</P>
<P>
   The other Western candidate, of course, is McNown. Before his
395-yard, three-touchdown day against Oregon, the Bruin quarterback
had been written off because he hadn't put up gaudy numbers.
Despite leading his team to the nation's longest winning streak, 15
games _ and the No. 2 ranking by The New York Times computer and in
The Associated Press poll _ he was lampooned in the school paper as
McNone.
</P>
<P>
   He put himself back in the race with his game against Oregon,
but he doesn't seem to care anymore. Engaging and competitive,
McNown has tired of the second-guessing and dismisses the Heisman
race as ``silly talk.'' Still pale from a stomach virus after the
game, but wearing a smile as glowing as his red hair, he spoke
joyously of the Bruins' comeback and the wide-open finish.
</P>
<P>
   No poll, no Heisman talk. The best thing about it was that
McNown acted as if he didn't care whether anyone was watching at
all. Either way, he had big fun.

<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ The Giants' season may have been saved
more than a week before the team beat up on the Arizona Cardinals
Sunday at the Meadowlands. That was when defensive end Michael
Strahan and linebacker Jessie Armstead walked into an
offensive-team meeting and basically told them, in the words of
Armstead, ``to stop playing like a bunch of punks.''
</P>
<P>
   Strahan and Armstead sent the players in the room into a state
of disbelief. What were these defensive players doing in their
meeting, criticizing them?
</P>
<P>
   Though both players say they were not attacking any one player
or position, it is no secret that the defensive players have been
disgusted by what they feel has been soft play by the offensive
line. So, before the Giants played Atlanta last Sunday, Strahan and
Armstead wanted players on the offense to check their pulse. Anyone
without a heartbeat was to check themselves out of the lineup and
onto the golf course.
</P>
<P>
   After the speech, the Giants were blown out by the Falcons, but
that doesn't mean the chat didn't work. Offensive players said the
message stuck with them for days afterward, like bad tuna, all the
way up to the Cardinals game. They were furious. They practiced
hard and mad. This week, Strahan kept up the pressure. Once, as a
couple of offensive linemen walked by his locker, Strahan called
them a word that would make Howard Stern blush. The word was
another way to call someone soft.
</P>
<P>
   There is no way to accurately portray how different the Giants
looked Sunday. For the first time they resembled the team that won
the National Football Conference East last year and there is no
question that what Strahan and Armstead did was a big part of that.
The Cardinals aren't a good team, bunched up with two dozen other
clubs that play mediocre football. But the Giants have been playing
so poorly this year that beating Arizona was no certainty, and if
they had lost, their playoff chances would nearly have been buried.
</P>
<P>
   Strahan and Armstead, the only two Pro Bowlers on the Giants,
understood that if the Giants were going to make the playoffs, the
offense had to play better. The three-and-out stuff on every series
had to stop. They also realized that they were the only players on
the team with the clout to send such a message. Strahan and
Armstead couldn't care less about their popularity or hurting
anyone's feelings. All they want to do is win.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were very upset with what they did,'' said running back
Tiki Barber. ``We thought it was out of line. But I have to admit,
it worked. There was a carryover, no question. We were mad for a
long time.''
</P>
<P>
   The Giants' offensive line pounded Arizona's solid defensive
front of Andre Wadsworth, Eric Swann, Mark Smith and Simeon Rice.
Giants running back Gary Brown had the team's first 100-yard game
of the season with 108 yards on 24 carries. Quarterback Danny
Kanell, for the first time this year, wasn't running scared. He had
time to complete 22 of 36 passes for 259 yards and three touchdowns
with no interceptions.
</P>
<P>
   ``A week later, the offense responded,'' Armstead said. ``Maybe
they finally got mad. They were crying all this week about what
Mike and I said, but they stopped crying and finally hit
somebody.''
</P>
<P>
   What had frustrated Strahan is that few people on the offensive
side of the ball got irate when things were going bad during a
game. Strahan doesn't want what happened last season in the
playoffs against Minnesota, when defensive players almost got into
a fistfight, to happen again. He simply wants offensive players to
have the kind of emotion they do on the defensive side.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't point fingers at anyone,'' Strahan said. ``We just
said things in general. I stood up and said, `We need to play with
fire, like we give a darn.' Then Jessie stood up and said, `It's
time to play with emotion. Hey, Danny, if you see a lineman mess
up, tell him, yell at him. If you see a receiver mess up, yell at
him. I know when I make a mistake, people point it out. When our
defensive backs make mistakes, I yell at them.' That's how it went.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some players were offended. But that's too bad. We needed to
turn things around. I was actually nice. I tell you what, if we
would have lost to Arizona, then I would not have been nice.''
</P>
<P>
   Strahan and Armstead aren't the kind of players who hammer
teammates then fail to perform themselves. Against Arizona, the two
did what they always do _ back up their attitude with action.
Strahan had four tackles, one sack and hurried quarterback Jake
Plummer about six times. Armstead had five tackles, one
interception and knocked a pass to the ground.
</P>
<P>
   Then, to show there were no hard feelings, after the offense
scored its third touchdown of the game, Strahan shook the hand of
every offensive player as they walked to the sideline.
</P>
<P>
   To Strahan, like Armstead, it's all business. Get the job done,
everything is fine. If not, be prepared to hear an earful.

<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ When Dave Brown trotted onto the field
at Giants Stadium with 6 minutes 12 seconds left in the game
Sunday, he got roughly the same reaction from the fans that he had
received in his final year as a Giant: He was booed heartily. A
hometown boy who never quite made good enough, the only cheers for
Brown came when the referee announced a roughing-the-passer call
that had crushed him to the turf.
</P>
<P>
   Brown had left the Giants on April 29, an anticlimactic
departure, when he signed as an unrestricted free agent with the
Arizona Cardinals. Now, he came back to fill out the final minutes
of garbage time in a 34-7 loss. ``The fans got their money's worth
today,'' Brown said. ``They saw the Giants win and me get in the
game. It's typical. I thought they'd react that way and they did.''
</P>
<P>
   He developed that callused exterior during six seasons in New
York, taking almost as many hits from the fans and news media as he
did from the opposition. After joining the Giants as a supplemental
first-round pick in 1992, he took over at quarterback from Phil
Simms in 1994. Simms took his two championship trophies and his
hard-earned place in New York's heart, leaving Brown with shoes he
would never fill.
</P>
<P>
   Brown was 23-30 as a starter. It may not all have been his
fault, but teammates bristled at what they saw as his refusal to
take the blame.
</P>
<P>
   He won his last full game as Giants quarterback, beating New
Orleans on Sept. 28, 1997, but on the final series, he took a hit
from cornerback Alex Molden and tore a chest muscle. Brown started
the next game against Dallas, but when he took another hit, Danny
Kanell took his place. Brown spent four weeks recovering, snapping
a streak of 44 consecutive games started, and the job was Kanell's.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it was a situation where I followed a legend in Phil
Simms on a deteriorating team,'' Brown said. ``They had to make a
change and I think we kind of bottomed out, and then we started
getting better. When Jim Fassel came here, I think he came at a
great time. We were starting to get a better team, a better
defense. Everywhere you go there has to be a bridge between the
legend and somebody else. Unfortunately, I was that bridge, I
think.''
</P>
<P>
   The wounds still showed Sunday: Brown received few greetings
from his old teammates and mostly derision from the fans in a
stadium close to where he grew up in Westfield, N.J. He played one
series in relief of Jake Plummer, completing two of five passes for
31 yards. On Brown's third play, Keith Hamilton was whistled for
roughing him. Two plays later, the Giants jumped offside, but the
blitzing safety Percy Ellsworth hit Brown hard anyway. Aided by the
penalties, Brown drove the Cardinals to the Giants' 19. But on
fourth-and-3, Brown was sacked to end the threat.
</P>
<P>
   ``You never like to get in that way, when it's a loss like
that,'' Brown said. ``But it's the first time I've played in a
while so it felt kind of fun being out there. I had butterflies,
sure. You want to play well against your old team. Hopefully I did
that. I would have liked to had a touchdown at the end of the game,
but still, it's garbage time. It doesn't really matter.''
</P>
<P>
   It was Brown's first action with Arizona, coming because Plummer
struggled. But Brown has no illusions about doing what Kanell did,
snatching the starting job.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jake's the guy,'' Brown said. ``Jake's proven he's a winner. I
was brought out here to help him and kind of assist him in any way
possible.''

   In Washington, new and old combine in a cultural highlight.
What's new is the Washington Opera season, beginning on Saturday
and including 74 performances of eight operas. What's old is the
opening attraction: Umberto Giordano's ``Fedora,'' which has
reached the age of 100 and will be performed for the first time by
the company when the curtain goes up in the Opera House at the
Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts.
</P>
<P>
   Adding to the luster are the stars, Mirella Freni as the
hot-tempered but vulnerable Russian princess Fedora, and Placido
Domingo as her love-hate object, Count Loris. Roberto Abbado will
make his Washington Opera debut as conductor, in a Teatro La Scala
production directed by David Edwards. Information: (202) 295-2400.

   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil _ As the Colombian government prepared
for peace talks with rebels to try to end three decades of civil
violence, an explosion believed to be the work of rebels hit the
country's most important oil pipeline early Sunday, killing at
least 25 people and wounding scores more.
</P>
<P>
   Police officials attributed the attack, on the Ocensa pipeline
in northern Antioquia province, to the National Liberation Army,
the country's second-largest rebel group. Its leaders were given a
furlough from prison just a week ago to open peace talks with
business and civic leaders.
</P>
<P>
   British Petroleum and the Colombian state oil company Ecopetrol
are majority owners of the pipeline, which exploded shortly after 2
a.m. near the village of Machuca. The blast set fire to the
village, where most of those killed were sleeping. Throughout the
day, rescue workers flew to the region in helicopters to collect
the dead and wounded.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have reports of 25 dead and 65 injured,'' Guillermo Leon
Franco, director of the Antioquia health department, told Reuters
news service.
</P>
<P>
   The pipeline carries 350,000 barrels a day of crude oil from
Colombia's largest oil operation, British Petroleum's
Cusiana-Cupiagua complex, and the explosion froze pipeline
operations. The attack occurred near the town of Segovia, in a
region where right-wing paramilitary groups have grown in tandem
with a heightened army presence to protect oil operations from
rebel activity. Alfredo Rangel, a former national security adviser
to the government, said the attack seemed to be a sign from the
rebels that ``they still have a presence in the region.''
</P>
<P>
   Pipeline attacks have been a frequent source of income for the
rebel group, which collects kickbacks from contractors hired to
repair the damage. Several leaders of the Oil Workers Union are
facing criminal charges for colluding in pipeline bombings.
</P>
<P>
   But until now, the main target of such attacks had been the
Cano-Limon-Covenas pipeline, run by Occidental Petroleum. The
rebels bombed the that pipeline 61 times this year and 64 times
last year.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, 30 soldiers were killed and more than 15 wounded
during guerrilla attacks on Occidental's pipeline and
installations. Recently, attacks on the wellheads have become more
frequent, a sign of the growing boldness of the rebels.
</P>
<P>
   By Sunday night, however, the rebel group had not come forward
to claim responsibility. A commander of the group said through
intermediaries that he could not reach the leaders at the front for
confirmation, but he believed that members of his organization had
carried out the attack.
</P>
<P>
   Like other oil companies working in Colombia, British Petroleum
pays the government for military protection. Two years ago, the
company acknowledged paying $33 million for a three-year protection
contract. But the company has come under attack for alleged
excesses by the army units.
</P>
<P>
   A newspaper investigation published over the weekend in The
Guardian in Britain and El Espectador in Bogota said a British
Petroleum security chief had helped arm and finance an army brigade
implicated in death squad massacres in the 1980s. The man was
dismissed after questions were raised, and the company has declined
to comment.
</P>
<P>
   In recent days, the country's new president, Andres Pastrana,
has given recognition as political movements to the National
Liberation Army, believed to have 5,000 members under arms, and to
the larger rebel group, the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia,
with an estimated 15,000 combatants.

CANIZALES IS NO LIGHTWEIGHT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MICHAEL ROSENTHAL  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Orlando Canizales is one of the best fighters of all-time _ and
also one of the least-known.
</P>
<P>
   For six years, the hard-punching Texan ruled the bantamweight
division as no other little fighter in history, defending his IBF
championship a record 17 times between 1988 and 1994.
</P>
<P>
   At only 32 and still active, he should be cashing in on his past
deeds; he should be fighting for significant sums against
significant opponents before significant crowds. He should be
receiving respect.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he is largely overlooked and struggling to get one more
championship fight.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, it's frustrating,'' said Canizales, whose tentative
opponent Thursday at the Country Club in Reseda is journeyman Tomas
Valdez. ``I'm just trying to stay active, fighting 10-rounders. And
eventually, I hope, something big will come up.''
</P>
<P>
   It's difficult to determine exactly how Canizales managed to
fade away even though he's still around. In part, he attributes it
to the fact he has never signed with a promoter. Instead, he has
been a free-lancer under guidance of longtime manager Bob Spagnola.
</P>
<P>
   There are also two losses in two years, to Wilfredo Vasquez for
the WBA junior featherweight title in 1995 and to Junior Jones the
following year.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest factor might be this: Aside from his accomplishments
in the ring, he's ordinary. He's reserved, he has never been in
trouble, his idea of fun is an evening at home. He has no gold
medals and he fights in the relatively anonymous lower-weight
classes. In other words, he has nothing on which to base an
effective marketing campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Canizales has an unusual background by boxing standards.
</P>
<P>
   He has three brothers, including former WBA bantamweight champ
Gaby Canizales. All three brothers have at least an associate
college degree and Orlando is following suit. In addition to his
training, he is taking college courses and plans to earn a degree
in psychology or sociology. He might work with at-risk kids.
</P>
<P>
   And, unlike so many fighters, he has invested his earnings
wisely, mostly in real estate. His desire to prolong his career at
an age when many lighter-weight fighters are long gone isn't about
money.
</P>
<P>
   However, it appears all this _ and the record number of defenses
_ isn't enough.
</P>
<P>
   Canizales (48-3-1, with 36 knockouts) has received some offers
to fight big-name opponents but hasn't been in the ring with one
since the Jones fight. And he hasn't fought on television for a
year and a half.
</P>
<P>
   ``You see another guy who doesn't have the resume Orlando has
getting offers twice as big as Orlando and you say ``(Forget)
that,' '' Spagnola said. ``I'm not going to let him do that. It's
ridiculous.''
</P>
<P>
   Canizales' mission at the moment is to land a fight with the
featherweight everyone in or near the division is clamoring to
meet: Prince Naseem Hamed, the flamboyant Briton who brings big
paydays to both parties.
</P>
<P>
   Canizales has been in the running but has received what Spagnola
believes are insulting offers from Hamed's handlers, roughly a
third of the $600,000 Kevin Kelly made and Wayne McCullough will
make when he meets Hamed on Oct. 31 in Atlantic City.
</P>
<P>
   Still, that's the one Canizales wants.
</P>
<P>
   Hamed is regarded as the best featherweight in the world. What
better challenge for a still-motivated, still-competitive champion
looking to make one more significant mark before he calls it quits?
</P>
<P>
   ``I made history in the sport of boxing,'' Canizales said. ``. .
.Now, I want to win a world title in another weight class. I want
to continue to make history.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Change of heart: Recently it seemed Evander Holyfield's
refusal to fight Lennox Lewis was because he didn't want to
jeopardize a potentially more-lucrative matchup with Mike Tyson.
</P>
<P>
   Now it appears he will take part in the title-unification bout
in February for the $20 million he rejected earlier this year. What
changed?
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps his view of Lewis, who looked ordinary and beatable
against Zeljko Mavrovic last month. Suddenly, the WBC champ didn't
seem to be as a big a risk as once thought. Of course, Lewis could
be thinking the same thing: Holyfield looked ordinary in his last
defense against Vaughn Beacon.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis is expected to sign his end of the contract today.
Holyfield signed on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Promoter Don King and HBO must reach an agreement for the fight
to take place.
</P>
<P>
   __ Tyson situation: It seems unlikely that the Nevada State
Athletic Commission will give Tyson a license today after his trial
for alleged assault in a Washington D.C. suburb was pushed back to
Dec. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Commissioners have said they want the D.C. incident to be
settled before they make a move.
</P>
<P>
   The hearing will be televised by U.S. Satellite Broadcasting
live at 9 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   __ Show canceled: One of boxing's most knowledgable and
passionate voices has been silenced. For now.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Kim has lost the call-in talk show on XTRA (690) he has
hosted for the past year and a half. He will remain on the air with
the station in a variety of roles: He'll do news updates,
on-the-field reports and more.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love the sport (boxing),'' said Kim, who also hosted a
similar show on KIEV for a year. ``. . .The reason they made the
decision was they don't want specialty shows. In certain ways, it's
a step up. They want to gear me more for the mainstream.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I plan to stay in boxing somehow, some way. I'll be
back.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Rabbit punches: Gabriel Ruelas will face talented but
light-punching John Brown on the undercard of the David Reid-James
Coker card Saturday in Atlantic City.
</P>
<P>
   Ruelas was scheduled to face James Leija, who had to pull out
because of a rib injury.
</P>
<P>
   The card is on HBO. . . .
</P>
<P>
   Mike Acre, the manager of Hector Camacho, said a bout with North
Hollywood's P.J. Goossen could take place in Pittsburgh or Los
Angeles on Dec. 4 or Dec. 11 if he can reach an agreement with
Univision.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really still up in the air. I'll know more next week,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Camacho faces Ken Sigurani on Friday in Chester, W. Virginia, on
ESPN2. . . .
</P>
<P>
   Carl Chancellor, the 7-foot, 425-pound heavyweight, probably
won't fight on the Country Club card as scheduled because of a hand
injury.

   CHAMPAIGN, Ill. _ The boast has been enough to bring tears to
the eyes of University of Illinois alums, who can be recognized by
the louder-than-a-boom-box orange attire they customarily don for
the Big Ten football games here at Zupke Field.
</P>
<P>
   For nearly a century, Illinois has prided itself as the
birthplace of American homecomings, the autumn ritual of welcoming
back alumni with parades, dances and football.
</P>
<P>
   The first college homecoming, legend has it, started when two
Illinois students, Dab Williams and W. Elmer Ekblaw, invited alumni
to the football game on Oct. 16, 1910, against its bitter rival,
the University of Chicago, and convinced the school administration
to make a three-day celebration of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately,'' said William Broom, the associate dean of
students at Illinois, referring to the school's claim to be the
cradle of homecoming, ``it's a myth.''
</P>
<P>
   It turns out that Baylor University held a homecoming one year
earlier, a fact that Baylor officials brought to the attention of
Illinois partisans a year ago, taking the bragging rights to the
Texas campus.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Illinois has turned almost iconoclastic about some of its
homecoming rituals. The school announced last month that it would
end the tradition of crowning a king and queen at its homecoming
celebration, which took place last week. The university continues
to recognize a homecoming court, 10 men and 10 women honored for
their scholastic and community achievements.
</P>
<P>
   Saying the coronation created a ``false hierarchy,'' Broom said
there was ``strong sentiment among student leaders'' to end the
practice.
</P>
<P>
   The event had also become a forum for protest. A year ago, the
homecoming king and queen wore shirts with a message deploring
racial stereotypes in a protest against the school's Indian-like
mascot.
</P>
<P>
   While many colleges and high schools continue to crown a king
and queen at homecoming, academic officials say the tradition has
undergone some changes over the years.
</P>
<P>
   Many high schools have changed the format of selecting a king
and queen, choosing candidates on the basis of scholastic ability
and community service, a change that has broken the pattern of
crowning the prettiest girl and the football quarterback. Other
schools have added talent shows to their homecoming festivities, a
way to recognize students who do not wear helmets and cleats. And
many schools have stopped the annual homecoming parade for lack of
interest.
</P>
<P>
   ``Homecoming today is more the student body, and not so much a
community event,'' said Terri Busch, an assistant principal at
Hoffman Estates High School in suburban Chicago, where the the
parade was stopped several years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of moving in and out, especially in the suburbs.
And people are just so busy,'' Busch said. ``There isn't that same
sense of community and old school loyalty.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   While homecoming is perhaps most deeply rooted in the Midwest _
it comes at a time of celebrating the harvest _ the tradition is
observed in every region of the country. Some regions, especially
in the South, have customarily chosen a queen, but not a king.
</P>
<P>
   Trying to move away from the imperious flavor of choosing a
royal court, Fort Meade High School in Florida has switched from a
homecoming queen to ``homecoming sweethearts.''
</P>
<P>
   The student body chooses eight girls, who are introduced at a
pep rally in alphabetical order, so that no one is given a higher
rank. Then the field is trimmed to four at the big football game,
again with each girl introduced in alphabetical order.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it stays at four _ we don't single out a girl,'' said
Jackie Burch, the student council adviser at Fort Meade.
</P>
<P>
   Some parents scorn such changes as part of a touchy-feely notion
bent on sparing feelings at all costs. They compare to it other
egalitarian movements in schools, like the elimination of class
valedictorians.
</P>
<P>
   But plenty of other parents, especially those with children
whose hearts sink as they watch more popular students parade before
adoring crowds, could not be happier to see a revolt against the
old caste system of a high school aristocracy.
</P>
<P>
   Besides that, they say, the ancestors of many Americans came to
this country fleeing monarchy, and find it silly to put royal
crowns on the heads of young girls and boys.
</P>
<P>
   ``Out of here,'' said Jan Binder, who was the Snowball Queen at
Monona Grove High School in Wisconsin in 1978, and is now the
mother of girls in grammar school. ``Let's get rid of it tonight _
if not sooner.''

SIDES AGREE: ARBITRATOR'S RULING WON'T END NBA WALKOUT
</HEADLINE>
   (jw) 
 By MIKE WISE    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   More than 220 National Basketball Association players with
guaranteed contracts will find out Monday whether they are to be
paid during the management lockout, a long-awaited arbitrator's
decision that may affect leverage in the league's dispute with the
players and have major ramifications on American sports-labor law.
</P>
<P>
   But neither the players nor the owners are counting on the
ruling by the arbitrator, John Feerick, to speed up negotiations,
especially if Feerick finds in favor of the players, an award that
could approach $800 million in salaries.
</P>
<P>
   NBA attorneys have indicated to the union that if the decision
goes against management, they will seek to have it vacated by
appealing to the U.S. District Court in Manhattan and then, if
necessary, to the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, a process that
could prevent the players from getting paid for several months.
</P>
<P>
   The NBA has already canceled the first two weeks of the regular
season because of the labor dispute.
</P>
<P>
   The league has other litigation pending in U.S. District Court
in Manhattan. If the players win the ruling, the NBA intends to
renew its motion to disqualify Feerick. The motion was brought last
summer on the grounds that no collective bargaining agreement
existed and, therefore, he had no jurisdiction to hear the matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he rules in our favor, I think it emboldens the spirit and
the resolve of the players,'' said Billy Hunter, union executive
director. ``But we understand that won't end the lockout. It just
means they have to pay 200-some players. And there is still other
litigation alive that may take a while to resolve. At most, it's a
hollow victory.''
</P>
<P>
   Feerick will have taken the full 30 days to render his decision.
Whatever he decides, his ruling will be watched carefully. There is
no precedent for locked-out athletes being paid. During the NBA
summer lockout of 1995, players who missed paychecks did not file a
grievance. Neither did National Hockey League players who were
locked out for the first three months of the 1994-95 season.
</P>
<P>
   The union argued that owners should have protected themselves by
inserting clauses about non-payment for lockouts and strikes into
individual player contracts. In support of its arguments, the union
pointed to clauses in a few individual player contracts that
contained language precluding payment during a lockout.
</P>
<P>
   The league is relying on the basic tenets of labor law, which
hold that employees not be paid during strikes or lockouts.
</P>
<P>
   A ruling for the union would be significant for all future
negotiations between players and owners. The deterrent factor of a
lockout is that employees subject to a collective bargaining
agreement do not get paid once the agreement expires and they are
unable to reach a new agreement.
</P>
<P>
   If Feerick finds in favor of the players, there will be no
economic incentive for those with guaranteed contracts to reach an
agreement quickly. They would essentially be paid for not playing
basketball.
</P>
<P>
   If Feerick finds in favor of the owners, the reality of not
being paid may spur the players to reach an agreement more quickly.
</P>
<P>
   But Hunter disputed this notion, and in a conference call Friday
talked openly about the entire season's being canceled before the
players would back away from their ultimate goals.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not at all concerned,'' Hunter said. ``There's been no
demonstration that there's going to be a change in our resolve.
After the players saw these proposals from the league and the
recent posturing by NBA owners, well, I had two players call me up
and tell me, if need be, they'd be willing to hock everything
they've got.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Another significant development may be thedeparture of many
players to Europe until the dispute is settled, according to at
least two player agents.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it would be a case-by-case basis, but yes, there's
already some people talking about that,'' said Bill Strickland, a
member of the union's agents advisory committee.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Kauffman, another member of the committee, said he would
explore the possibility that one client, Nets center Rony Seikaly,
would sign with a professional team in Greece.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wouldn't look to void his deal with the team,'' Kauffman
said. ``But we would want him to have the right for him to work
temporarily until he could come back and honor his contract.'
</P>
<P>
   Russ Granik, NBA deputy commissioner, said the league has
approved the idea of players' earning a living elsewhere until the
lockout is settled.
</P>
<P>
   Proposals exchanged last week that included the concept of a
luxury-tax system on player salaries appeared to reflect the first
signs of progress in negotiations since the lockout began July 1.
But both sides have termed the figures in each other's proposal as
unacceptable, and it was unclear whether either side was willing
compromise.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we should get too carried away about the
possibilities just yet,'' Granik said. ``When they explored the
idea of a tax system, we were taking the players at their word that
they wanted to make some headway. But to call their first proposal
meaningless is charitable. They proposed something that has no
impact. As it stands, that can't be the solution.''

CAREFULLY OPTIMISTIC, U.S. ANNOUNCES EXTENSION OF MIDEAST PEACE
TALKS 
</HEADLINE>
  (js)

<P>
   WYE MILLS, Md. _ Despite more than 20 hours of personal
engagement by President Clinton, talks with Israeli and Palestinian
leaders on an interim peace accord will continue past their
original deadline and into Monday, U.S. officials announced Sunday
evening.
</P>
<P>
   ``The work is continuing at a good pace,'' said State Department
Spokesman James Rubin. ``There is a serious effort being made, and
the meetings today and our overall mood and the atmosphere
justifies almost certainly continuing these meetings tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's spokesman, Joseph Lockhart, said: ``We believe it's in
the best interests of the peace process to continue the
discussions.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials did not try to put a gloss on the extension,
citing the detailed nature of the problems to be worked out and the
continuing lack of trust among the parties. One senior
administration official said extension was not failure, and success
was still possible.
</P>
<P>
   It was not immediately clear whether Clinton would return on
Monday to the Wye Conference Center near here, where Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat
have been since Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   But with three days of direct negotiations by Clinton, who was
joined on Sunday by Vice President Al Gore, and with a full-time
mediation effort by Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and the
director of central intelligence, George Tenet, a failure to reach
agreement here would be a devastating blow to Clinton's prestige
and to the search for a Middle East peace.
</P>
<P>
   But some officials suggested that the U.S. urgency is not fully
shared by the Israeli or Palestinian leaders, who will have to make
difficult political choices that will almost certainly alienate
important parts of their constituencies. As of Sunday evening, U.S.
officials confirmed, Netanyahu and Arafat have not met together
since Friday.
</P>
<P>
   What is at stake, after a 19-month delay, is an interim accord
under which the Israelis will withdraw from another 13 percent of
the West Bank in stages over 12 weeks, in return for phased and
verifiable Palestinian steps to fight terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   ``The parties are into real bargaining at last,'' one official
said, ``and we want to keep them talking.'' But the official said
that while significant progress had been made on different issues,
including security, there was no complete agreement on any of the
major issues.
</P>
<P>
   On another perfect autumn day, with the leaves turning russet in
the bright sun, the Americans made a big push to get an agreement.
Clinton, who had stayed for a dinner Saturday night with Arafat and
the Palestinians, helped organize a long night of meetings
supervised by Ms. Albright, who has remained at the Wye Center
since Thursday. Clinton, together with Gore, returned again Sunday
morning for another long day of chats, walks, meals and pressure.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton first met with his team, then with the Israelis,
including a long lunch with Netanyahu. Arafat, in his traditional
regalia, including a keffiyeh, was said to have taken a bicycle
ride for more than an hour, while bodyguards, both U.S. and
Palestinian, jogged alongside.
</P>
<P>
   At about 6 p.m., Clinton met for an hour with Arafat, then took
a break for dinner with his staff. He was scheduled to meet again
with Arafat at about 8 p.m. and then to have another conversation
with Netanyahu after that.
</P>
<P>
   ``The talks continue and the president will remain engaged
throughout the evening,'' Lockhart said. But he said he did not not
expect the three leaders to meet together at any time during the
night.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether after so much direct involvement by so many senior
members of the Clinton administration it was possible to allow
Netanyahu and Arafat to leave here without an agreement, Rubin
simply said: ``That's a very well-formulated question.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials had said that their decision to bring the leaders
here was a risk so soon before the mid-term elections on Nov. 3,
but that no president was likely to be punished by the U.S. voter
for making an effort to advance the cause of peace in the Middle
East.
</P>
<P>
   One official said, however, that much of what remains to be
decided is in the hands of Netanyahu and if an agreement required
public pressure on Israel that could be ``potentially risky'' and
could alienate some American voters.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday evening, Rubin would not discuss the stakes for the
administration, except to say that the Americans ``do feel a sense
of urgency.'' Entering these meetings, ``we felt very strongly that
in the absence of making these kinds of agreements and putting the
peace process back on track there were serious dangers ahead for
the peoples of the Middle East,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe in a sense of urgency and we are trying to instill
that into the parties,'' Rubin added. ``But I would not want to
characterize how urgent they feel the situation is.''
</P>
<P>
   The Americans are particularly conscious that the Oslo accords
expire on May 4. By that date, Palestinians and Israelis are
supposed to have completed a final peace settlement that sets
Palestine's borders, its status, the fate of refugees and the
future of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat has threatened to declare Palestinian statehood
unilaterally on May 5, but the Americans and even the opposition
Labor Party in Israel, which negotiated the Oslo accords, have
warned him not to take such unilateral actions. At the same time,
U.S. officials say that a May 4 deadline cannot be ignored, and
that tensions in the region could explode if Arafat and the
Israelis are not well on their way toward an agreement.
</P>
<P>
   But this interim deal must be settled first. If that can be
accomplished, the final status talks will formally re-open under
Clinton's aegis, with the aim of trying to complete at least the
framework for a peace treaty before next May.
</P>
<P>
   Rubin appealed to the two sides to find ``the political will''
to agree to this relatively minor accord. ``There is time to
complete the work if the political will is there to make the tough
decisions,'' he said. Rubin denied that the Americans have any
interest in a partial agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Difficult issues remain, officials said, including a method by
which Palestinian efforts to combat terrorism will be judged and an
Israeli demand for the extradition of Palestinians wanted in
Israel.
</P>
<P>
   There has been talk that the CIA, which sits with both sides on
a security committee, could vet the cases against wanted
Palestinians and decide whether they should be tried. When Israel
asks for extradition now, , the Palestinians answer that the person
is wanted for charges by the Palestinian authorities, so may not be
handed over.
</P>
<P>
   The Palestinians also want guarantees of prisoner releases by
the Israelis, and want firm guarantees that a third interim
withdrawal by the Israelis from the West Bank, called for under the
Oslo and Hebron accords, will take place. At the moment, there is a
general agreement that the issue will be handled by the borders
committee set up under the final status talks.
</P>
<P>
   But Rubin said that Washington clearly did not want a third
interim redeployment to create the same kinds of problems that all
sides face here, with their efforts to finish the first two
redeployments.
</P>
<P>
   Rubin and the Americans were also eager to knock down an Israeli
newspaper report that Jordan's King Hussein, under treatment for
lymphoma at the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota, is dying.
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper, Yediot Ahronot, said in Sunday's editions that
U.S. officials had told Netanyahu's aides that the king's condition
is terminal and ``it is doubtful he will ever return to actively
functioning as king in full capacity.''
</P>
<P>
   It said that the Americans and Israelis had discussed a
transition of power to the king's brother, Crown Prince Hassan, and
fears that there could be instability in Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   The statement described the king as ``making good progress'' and
said, ``We look forward to his full recovery.'' But the statement
added: ``We have great confidence in Crown Prince Hassan, who has
been and remains a very able partner for King Hussein, as well as
for the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Both the king and crown prince have continued to play very
active and helpful roles in support of the peace process and the
Wye peace talks,'' the statement said.
</P>
<P>
   Rubin said later that the report was entirely untrue, and that
both Clinton and Ms. Albright had spoken by telephone with the king
in recent days.
</P>
<P>
   Ariel Sharon, the new Israeli foreign minister, also issued a
statement denying that he had said that the king, whom he visited
before coming here, is dying. But photographs of the meeting showed
Hussein looking very ill after another round of chemotherapy, and
U.S. officials have also been careful to be in touch with the crown
prince, including a telephone call to him Sunday morning from Ms.
Albright.
</P>
<P>
   Hussein, who has ruled Jordan for 45 years, has been diagnosed
with non-Hodgkins lymphoma, a type of cancer that primarily
afflicts the lymph nodes and spleen. He has been receiving
treatment at the Mayo Clinic since mid-July.

SCHUMER WINS ENVIRONMENTAL NOD 
</HEADLINE>
  (jw) 
 By ABBY GOODNOUGH    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORT WASHINGTON, N.Y. _ Rep. Charles Schumer brought his
campaign for the U.S. Senate to the edge of Long Island Sound on
Sunday, accepting endorsements from several environmental groups
and saying that Sen. Alfonse D'Amato had done nothing to protect
the waters surrounding his home base of Long Island.
</P>
<P>
   ``People love the environment here,'' Schumer said as water
lapped and geese honked in the background. ``And shame of it all,
the senator who hails from Nassau County has a record at the bottom
of the environmental barrel.''
</P>
<P>
   Schumer, a Democrat from Brooklyn, received endorsements from
the New York League of Conservation Voters and the national Sierra
Club, whose representatives said he had consistently voted to
protect the environment during his 18 years in Congress. In
particular, they said, Schumer voted against weakening the Clean
Water Act in 1995 and against delaying the removal of toxic PCB's
from the Hudson River and other waterways in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   In comparison, the environmental advocates said, D'Amato, a
Republican, voted to decrease funds for the cleanup of toxic waste
sites and to weaken the ability of the federal Environmental
Protection Agency to enforce clean air standards, both in 1995.
D'Amato has occasionally voted to protect the environment, but only
in years when he was up for re-election, they said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The D'Amato effect, as I describe it, is the curious behavior
of the senator from New York, every six years, to suddenly turn
good on the environment,'' said Chuck McGrady, the national
president of the Sierra Club.
</P>
<P>
   ``This race is very simple to understand in environmental
terms,'' McGrady said. ``Chuck Schumer is there, protecting our
special places.''
</P>
<P>
   Carol Browner, the head of the EPA, also appeared with Schumer
here and praised his environmental record. ``You have a choice
between a candidate who has been strong on the environment and
someone who is sort of a fair-weather friend,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Harvey Valentine, a spokesman for D'Amato, said the senator was
proud of his environmental voting record, which he said included
``fighting to protect New York's forests, lakes and streams from
the devastating effects of acid rain'' and ``securing millions of
dollars for the purchase of natural-gas buses.''

 &HT;    Surprising Kentucky more than just Couch
 &HT;    By Mark Schlabach
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATHENS _ Last year, Kentucky served as homecoming fodder in
Georgia's turnaround season. The Bulldogs slowed down
record-setting quarterback Tim Couch, and held on for a 23-13 win
en route to a 10-2 record.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the Wildcats have apparently grown up under second-year
coach Hal Mumme, and enter Saturday's showdown against No. 11
Georgia in Lexington at 5-2, including a 2-2 mark in the SEC East.
</P>
<P>
   Kentucky will be riding the emotion from Saturday night's 39-36
victory at then-No. 21 LSU, perhaps the program's biggest win of
the 1990s and its first road upset of a ranked opponent since 1977.
</P>
<P>
   Mumme, the former coach at Valdosta State, set up the winning
score with characteristic trickery. On the Wildcats' final
possession, Mumme called two straight conservative running plays,
leaving the Tigers to believe they were headed for overtime.
</P>
<P>
   But Kentucky receiver Quentin McCord of LaGrange surprised LSU
with a 38-yard gain on an end-around, setting up Seth Hanson's
33-yard field goal as time expired. Kentucky outgained LSU in
rushing yards, 182-74, and held LSU's Kevin Faulk to 67 yards on 20
attempts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought they came out and surprised LSU running the ball in
the first half,'' Georgia coach Jim Donnan said. ``It looked like
LSU was trying to stop their underneath (throws), and (Kentucky)
hit them with the quick hits and draws. If you can't pressure
Couch, he'll hurt you with the quick passes, and, of course, he'll
hurt you throwing deep.''
</P>
<P>
   The game is a matchup of two of the top quarterback prospects
from 1995. Georgia freshman Quincy Carter, who spent the last two
years playing minor-league baseball, and Couch were both Parade
All-Americans as high school seniors.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were two of the best (three) years ago and still are in
my opinion,'' Donnan said.
</P>
<P>
   Carter had two touchdowns in the 31-6 win over Vanderbilt, but
played only one quarter after injuring his non-throwing shoulder
against Tennessee. Carter should be at full strength.
</P>
<P>
   Donnan also said cornerback Glenn Ford, who returned a blocked
punt for a touchdown against Vandy before leaving in the second
half with a slight concussion, also should be ready.

 &HT;    Chandler hurt, but no servere damage done to shoulder, ribs
 &HT;    By Curtis Bunn
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Well, at least it wasn't a concussion.
</P>
<P>
   That much could be said about Falcons quarterback Chris
Chandler's first injury of this season. Still, Chandler _ who was
carted off the field like a sack of bird seed too often last season
_ missed more than half of the Falcons' 31-23 victory against the
New Orleans Saints at the Georgia Dome.
</P>
<P>
   This time, Chandler left the field under his own power and with
his wits about him. He did, however, have bruised ribs and a
sprained left shoulder, injuries that thrust 44-year-old Steve
DeBerg into a significant role.
</P>
<P>
   The results of the tests were encouraging, on both counts.
X-rays showed no severe damage and Chandler said afterward he was
hopeful of being able to play next week against the New York Jets.
As for DeBerg, after an inauspicious few series, he found a comfort
zone and directed the club with aplomb in the final minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Steve did a good job in a tough situation,'' coach Dan Reeves
said.
</P>
<P>
   DeBerg said he had not seen significant time in the
regular-season since 1993.
</P>
<P>
   And it showed.
</P>
<P>
   He missed a handoff to Jamal Anderson in the third quarter and
was tackled in the end zone for a safety, cutting the Falcons'
advantage to 17-16 with 10:32 left.
</P>
<P>
   DeBerg said he did not feel comfortable until he got hit.
``After I got hit really hard, it was like, `Hmmm, that wasn't so
bad.'''
</P>
<P>
   Which is what Chandler hopes to be saying by midweek. His major
area of discomfort was in his rib cage under the shoulder blade.
Chandler was blindsided by 244-pound linebacker Mark Fields, who
slammed him into the turf. Chandler also had been hit hard on
several occasions in the first half.
</P>
<P>
   ``The field is in good condition,'' Chandler said. ``But the
downside is that the turf is rock hard.''
</P>
<P>
   DeBerg was solid much of the waning moments of the fourth
quarter. He was 7-for-10 for 60 yards. His third-down pass to
Terence Mathis _ which Mathis turned into a 26-yard gain to the
Saints' 17 _ was critical. Three plays later, DeBerg hit Bob
Christian on a short flare, and the fullback ran 8 yards for the
touchdown and 23-16 lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``That felt fantastic,'' DeBerg said. ``My responsibility is to
not lose the game. It took a while to get it together. Once I did,
I was solid. So this is very special.

 &HT;    Falcons' defense takes over at half
 &HT;    By Jeff Schultz
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ How many of these games have there been? The starting
quarterback goes down, the backup looks out of place in the huddle
(and without a baseball hat), and fans in the Georgia Dome wonder
if beating the traffic home would be more pleasing to the stomach
than watching the inevitable defensive collapse.
</P>
<P>
   How many? Too many.
</P>
<P>
   Except this time there was no defensive collapse.
</P>
<P>
   ``We talked about the situation at halftime,'' said Falcons
cornerback Ronnie Bradford. ``We knew our offense was not going to
run with the same efficiency with Steve (DeBerg). But we were still
ahead. It was up to us. If they don't score, they don't win.''
</P>
<P>
   We now present this atypical summary of a Falcons game: The
defense bailed out the offense. Overcoming some miscues in the
secondary, Atlanta's defense stuffed New Orleans' running game,
forced four New Orleans turnovers and held the Saints to one
second-half score (albeit an 82-yard touchdown pass) as the Falcons
held on for a 31-23 victory at the Dome.
</P>
<P>
   ``This just shows we've grown a lot as a defense,'' said
defensive tackle Travis Hall, whose play, along with that of Chuck
Smith and linebacker Cornelius Bennett, was key to holding the
Saints' running game to 1.9 yards per carry. ``We know now that we
can step up and play ferocious, vicious defense. I mean, we had
some serious ball-hawking out there. When you get four or five guys
flying to the ball, something is going to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   It had to take something big for the Falcons to finally win a
game without Chris Chandler, who left late in the second quarter
with a sprained left shoulder and bruised ribs. The play was
provided by Eugene Robinson with 10:37 left, when the free safety
picked off an errant pass by Billy Joe Tolliver and returned it 25
yards for a touchdown. It expanded Atlanta's led to 31-16 and,
well, allowed room for one more pratfall. With 3:19 left, Tolliver
ran out of the pocket and hit Keith Poole for an 82-yard score
after Poole beat rookie Elijah Williams.
</P>
<P>
   ``We took over the game on defense in the second half _
unfortunately, we still had that one play,'' defensive coordinator
Rich Brooks said.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson, who leads all active players with 50 career
interceptions, said the defense has made great strides, but, ``You
have to be able to sense when to put a team away. When everybody
senses that, that's when you win. When the defense is playing well,
like it did in the third quarter, it's contagious. ... You have
guys who are mediocre playing over their heads.''
</P>
<P>
   The Saints trailed 17-14 at halftime, but their only
third-quarter points came on a safety. Their first six possessions
resulted in: punt, fumble, fumble, punt, interception (Robinson's),
punt. New Orleans running back Lamar Smith was held to 13 yards on
seven carries in the second half. Tolliver, excluding the touchdown
to Poole, was 5-for-17 for 55 yards, one interception, one fumble
and one sack after halftime.
</P>
<P>
   ``The point we made to the players at halftime is, `The game is
in our hands,' '' Brooks said. ``We couldn't let them take the
lead. If they ever got the lead, it would've been a different
game.''
</P>
<P>
   And, likely, a different result.

 &HT;    Falcons overcome Saints, but not without flaws
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ With first place in the NFC West hanging in the
balance, the biggest Georgia Dome crowd since a 1995 sellout
against Dallas was on hand Sunday as Atlanta Falcons coach Dan
Reeves saw some of his worst fears realized against the New Orleans
Saints.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Jamal Anderson's record-tying fourth straight game
of 100 or more yards (132 on 25 carries) and a fourth-quarter
25-yard interception return for a touchdown by Falcons free safety
Eugene Robinson were the biggest factors in Atlanta's 31-23
victory.
</P>
<P>
   But it came at a steep price. Starting quarterback Chris
Chandler, who has helped keep the Falcons tied with San Francisco
atop the NFC West, left the game late in the second quarter with a
bruised left (non-throwing) shoulder and bruised ribs.
</P>
<P>
   There will be an additional examination today, but Reeves said,
``It doesn't look very good right now.'' Chandler is doubtful for
next Sunday's game against the Jets.
</P>
<P>
   After being slammed to the turf while being sacked from behind
by Saints linebacker Mark Fields, Chandler left the field for
medication and X-rays. He later was walking under his own power,
but that doesn't mean he's not seriously hurt.
</P>
<P>
   ``The X-rays didn't show any fracture or where it's chipped or
anything,'' he said. ``The rib under your shoulder blade, that's
where all the trouble is. I think it's just mainly the cartilage
and muscles in there that are sore. Hopefully, it'll be all right
by next week.''
</P>
<P>
   Chandler's replacement was 44-year-old Steve DeBerg, the NFL's
oldest player. He, like Chandler, completed 7-of-10 passes, but the
Falcons offense was dreadful the last couple minutes of the first
half, and all during a third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   When DeBerg muffed a handoff to Anderson on the Falcons' first
possession of the second half, he ended up taking a sack _ one of
five suffered by Atlanta _ and a safety with 10:32 left in the
third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   That pulled the Saints to within 17-16.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta's offense was dreadful for the remainder of the quarter,
losing 15 yards in all, but the defense made up for it.
</P>
<P>
   Although they allowed New Orleans 322 yards, 146 came on
touchdown passes of 64 and 82 yards from two-time former Falcons QB
Billy Joe Tolliver to wide receiver Keith Poole.
</P>
<P>
   Just as important, the Saints (3-3) came in tied for second in
the NFL with a plus-seven turnover ratio and had not lost a fumble
all season. They lost three Sunday, two in the second half. Atlanta
didn't turn any fumbles into points, but two stopped Saints' drives
inside the Atlanta 35-yard line.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Atlanta didn't lose the ball once.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a huge win for us,'' Reeves said. ``I can't tell you
how pleased I am that we overcame some of the things that we did.''
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta scored 17 points in the first half on a 22-yard field
goal by Morten Andersen, a 31-yard touchdown run by Anderson, and a
45-yard touchdown pass from Chandler to wide receiver Tony Martin.
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons countered with a 5-yard touchdown run by Lamar Smith
and a 64-yard touchdown pass from Tolliver to Poole, who had
improvised a short route to get behind cornerback Ronnie Bradford.
</P>
<P>
   The safety was the only scoring the third quarter, but the
fourth quarter featured big plays.
</P>
<P>
   A sack by Falcons' defensive tackle Shane Dronett helped force a
New Orleans punt, and DeBerg's 26-yard pass to wide receiver
Terance Mathis moved the ball to the New Orleans' 18. A few plays
later, on third-and-one from the New Orleans' 8, DeBerg hit
Christian with a short pass, and he broke four tackles to score his
first touchdown of the season and to give Atlanta a 24-16 lead with
11:05 left.
</P>
<P>
   DeBerg said he got more comfortable as time went on, and his
teammates did most of the work.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chris Chandler makes a lot of plays on his own,'' he said.
``Chris Chandler can make plays I can't. I need help. I need the
defense playing good, the running game going good. I really think
those guys understand that, and their level of play rises.
Everything I'm living now is just amazing.''
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons added insurance minutes later. Backed up at his own
2 and facing third-and-17, Tolliver overthrew Andre Hastings, and
Robinson, the NFL's leading active interceptor with 50, returned
the interception for a touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   Poole got behind Williams for his second long touchdown, making
it 31-23 with 3:19 left, but the Saints failed to execute an onside
kick, and the Falcons ran out the clock behind Anderson's running.
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons distributed 60,774 tickets for the game.

COMMENTARY: WHY WYE? 
</HEADLINE>
  (jw) 
 By WILLIAM SAFIRE    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Newly confident after a meeting with Prime Minister
Yevgeny Primakov in Moscow (at which that longtime KGB Arabist
offered ``unconditional support for Palestinian peace efforts''),
Yasser Arafat took much of the zip out of President Clinton's
pre-election October surprise.
</P>
<P>
   The deal for an agreement to move into final-stage negotiations
was seemingly all set. The Israelis had agreed to give up an
additional 13 percent of West Bank territory as the final
territorial inducement to start the endgame.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had named as his
foreign minister the redoubtable Ariel Sharon, a figure trusted by
Israelis to protect their security and trusted by many Palestinians
as a forthright adversary who can deliver what he promises. (On
reassuring the right, ``only'' de Gaulle; only Nixon; only Sharon.)
Sharon's visit to King Hussein in the Mayo Clinic was a symbol of
the mutual respect of lifelong foes.
</P>
<P>
   Needed from Arafat was tangible evidence of his promises to shut
down terrorism on a specific timetable, as well as to revise his
``covenant'' to destroy Israel by vote of the Palestinian National
Council. He had already agreed to these in the Hebron accords
nearly two years ago. The PLO was now selling these promises for
the second time, but too many suspected terrorist murderers are
serving in the Palestinian police force. This time Israel required
proof of compliance.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton thought he had Arafat on board as this month
began. With a total of 40 percent of the West Bank now in hand,
Palestinians _ Clinton was assured _ would be set to end the
impasse. Arafat would agree to demonstrate how they would carry out
old promises, thereby to move to the final phase of the long
negotiation: the grand agreement about more land, borders, arms
limitation, water, sovereignty and capitals.
</P>
<P>
   But something happened on the way to the Wye Plantation in
eastern Maryland. Chairman Arafat dug in his heels.
</P>
<P>
   The first inkling came in the selection of the site. Why Wye?
Clinton, naturally, wanted Camp David, with its resonances of
Begin-Sadat-Carter. Netanyahu had agreed to head for that famous
Catoctin Mountain retreat. But Arafat declined; a generation ago,
the PLO had condemned Sadat's courageous peacemaking as a sellout
of the Arab jihad. Instead of heading north to Camp David, the
leaders headed east to the less rustic and meaningful Wye
Plantation.
</P>
<P>
   What turned Arafat away from a deal last weekend? I can't read
his mind, but two logical answers:
</P>
<P>
   First, the Primakov pitch. As these negotiations began in
Madrid, the PLO support was collapsing. The Soviet Union was coming
apart; Iraq was defeated by the allies; and Iran was still bleeding
from its disastrous war with Iraq. But less than a decade later,
the strategic balance is shifting: Financially ailing Russia
remains a nuclear power; Iraq has worn down the United Nations; and
Iran's Shabad-4 missile and its Russian nuclear know-how threaten
the Middle East and Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Second, the Clintonites are good at stage-managing agreements
but demonstrably weak when it comes to enforcing them. Neither
Milosevic in the Balkans nor Saddam in the Persian Gulf is in
compliance with deals Clinton brokered or multilateraled. Arafat
can ask: Why should the PLO alone be burdened with the ignominy of
compliance? West Bank land is sand in the hand and cannot be taken
back; but promises about terror can be rescinded when their
American guarantor becomes distracted.
</P>
<P>
   The Wye meeting will not be allowed to fail; diplomacy does not
admit of public flops. Clinton can facilitate some narrowing of
differences, and Al Gore's presence suggests some progress is built
in. Soon enough, with forced smiles and hedging about much
remaining to be done, the leaders are likely to announce an advance
toward an agreement to move to final-stage talks.
</P>
<P>
   The sign of Israeli seriousness is Netanyahu's turn to Sharon,
whose eyes light up when he sees a map. As warrior and politician,
he knows every inch of his revered Judea and Samaria, what can be
given up and what must be held.
</P>
<P>
   The sign of Palestinian seriousness will be a willingness to
comply with past agreements, which Arafat will do only if he must.
Then _ with Clinton or Gore presiding _ on to the final deal, which
is not beyond the reach of realists.
</P>

JONATHAN POSTEL, INTERNET PIONEER, DIES AT 55
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif.)   (jw) 
 By KATIE HAFNER    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Jonathan Postel, who played a pivotal role in creating and
administering the Internet, died of complications after undergoing
heart surgery on Friday at St. John's Hospital in Santa Monica,
Calif., his brother Thomas Postel said. He was 55 and lived in Los
Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Postel, a computer scientist at the Information Sciences
Institute, a branch of the University of Southern California in
Marina del Rey, was a creator of the Internet's address system. For
30 years he handled the administrative end of Internet addresses
under the auspices of the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority, or
IANA, a federally financed entity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jon's greatest achievement was operating IANA,'' said Stephen
Crocker, a colleague of Postel. ``It is a very central piece of the
infrastructure. As mundane and as simple as it seemed, he set
policies that made it very easy for the network to grow. He
minimized bureaucratic delay and at the same time kept silly and
nonsensical things to a minimum.''
</P>
<P>
   Postel's interest in computers began while he attended a
community college in Los Angeles in the 1960s. He once described
himself as a ``mediocre student,'' a late academic bloomer whose
intense interest in computer science in general, and networking in
particular, did not begin until he transferred to the University of
California at Los Angeles, where he received his undergraduate
degree in engineering in 1966.
</P>
<P>
   He was one of a small group of computer scientists who created
the Internet's precursor, the Arpanet. At UCLA in 1969, Postel
assisted in the installation of the Arpanet's first communications
switch, which routed network traffic.
</P>
<P>
   For nearly 30 years, Postel also served as editor of the Request
for Comments series, or RFCs, technical notes that began with the
earliest days of the Arpanet and continued into the Internet.
Though intended to be informal, such notes often laid the
foundation for technical standards governing the Internet's
operation. Nearly 2,500 RFCs have been produced.
</P>
<P>
   As editor, Postel was technically rigorous, often refusing to
distribute an RFC until he was satisfied that it made good
engineering sense and showed tasteful design.
</P>
<P>
   ``His taste in design was by and large extraordinary,'' said
Vinton Cerf, chairman of the Internet Society, a professional group
to which Postel belonged. ``And yet he did it in a way that you
were only barely conscious that was nudging you toward better
design. As the rest of the Internet unfolds, we're going to
discover that Jon isn't there to remind us what good taste means.''
</P>
<P>
   As part of the effort to hand administration of the Internet
over to a private international corporation, earlier this month
Postel had delivered to the government a proposal to transform the
IANA into a nonprofit corporation, with broad representation from
the commercial and academic sectors.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed organization has been incorporated and has an
interim board of directors. Pending final approval from the
Department of Commerce, the new entity is prepared to take up its
responsibility, Cerf said.
</P>
<P>
   As testament to Postel's control over the highest levels of the
Internet, in conducting a test of its reliability this year he
rerouted the network's directory service to alternate locations.
Although there was no disruption of the Internet's operation, the
incident attracted widespread attention. Postel said he was
conducting an experiment to demonstrate the network's backup
capability.
</P>
<P>
   Explaining the action, Crocker said, ``I think he was exercising
his legitimate responsibility to make sure the network worked as
advertised.''
</P>
<P>
   Postel obtained a master's degree in engineering in 1968 and a
doctorate in computer science in 1974, both from UCLA.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the Internet Society, where he served as a
trustee, Postel was a member of the Association for Computing
Machinery.
</P>
<P>
   Besides his brother Thomas of Sherman Oaks, Calif., Postel is
survived by his companion, Susan Gould of Los Angeles; his mother,
Lois Postel of Sherman Oaks; another brother, Russell Postel of
Sebastopol, Calif., and a sister, Margie Bradshaw of Paisley,
Scotland.
</P>
<P>
   Postel assiduously avoided conflicts of interest. In 1995, as
the Internet was growing into a commercial business, a reporter
asked him why he had repeatedly turned down opportunities to pursue
wealth. He replied that starting a company to profit from his
activities would have amounted to what he called a ``violation of
public trust.''

ACCUSED OFFICIALS HAVE FEWER PLACES TO HIDE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Conn., Tenn.)  (See also PINOCHET-CHILE, PINOCHET-BRITAIN, PINOCHET-JUDGE.) 
(lb) 
 By ROBERT PEAR    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The arrest of Gen. Augusto Pinochet shows the
growing significance of international human-rights law, suggesting
that officials accused of atrocities have fewer places to hide
these days, even if they are carrying diplomatic passports, legal
scholars say.
</P>
<P>
   Pinochet, who ruled Chile as a military dictator from 1973 to
1990, was granted amnesty in his homeland but was arrested on
Friday in London at the request of Spanish authorities, who want
him extradited to Spain.
</P>
<P>
   A growing body of international law has in the last 10 years
made it somewhat easier to reach across borders and apprehend
suspects accused of torture, genocide and other ``crimes against
humanity.''
</P>
<P>
   A lawyer in Washington who represents victims of the Pinochet
administration, Samuel Buffone, said, ``What is really innovative
and important here is that a Spanish court is looking at
international acts of terrorism, systemic human-rights abuses and
genocide, and is asserting jurisdiction on that basis.''
</P>
<P>
   The Spanish authorities contend that Pinochet may have committed
crimes against Spanish citizens in Chile. They said the European
Convention on Terrorism and other treaties required Britain to
extradite Pinochet.
</P>
<P>
   ``The lesson here is that terrorists will have no safe haven and
are the modern-day equivalent of pirates,'' Buffone said.
``Anywhere they are found on the high seas they will be nabbed and
prosecuted.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Buergenthal, a professor of international law at George
Washington University here, expressed doubts that Pinochet was
entitled to diplomatic immunity, even though he has a diplomatic
passport.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that he wasn't accredited to Britain and was not in
transit to a diplomatic post,'' Buergenthal said, ``means that
Britain doesn't have to give him diplomatic immunity, unless there
was some prior arrangement to do so.''
</P>
<P>
   The case raises many complex legal questions. For example, does
Pinochet have any immunity because of his status as a former head
of state or because of his current status as a ``senator for life''
in Chile? Chile granted him amnesty, but are other countries
required to honor that amnesty? Could Spain try Pinochet for his
actions in Chile?
</P>
<P>
   Under the Chilean Constitution, adopted while he was in power,
Pinochet is immune from prosecution there.
</P>
<P>
   Professor Lori Damrosch, an expert on international law at
Columbia University, said: ``That doesn't carry any weight outside
Chile. It's not binding on any other country. All these
ex-dictators must have an understanding that they are somewhat at
risk when they leave their own countries.''
</P>
<P>
   The ``personal inviolability'' of diplomats is a venerable
privilege that can be traced from the protection accorded to
wartime emissaries in ancient Greece.
</P>
<P>
   The Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations of 1961 says,
``The purpose of such privileges and immunities is not to benefit
individuals, but to ensure the efficient performance of the
functions of diplomatic missions.''
</P>
<P>
   Thus, legal scholars say, diplomatic immunity was not created to
insulate people against prosecution for crimes against humanity or
other atrocities. In recent years courts have shown an increased
willingness to try criminal and civil cases involving contentions
that foreigners committed torture, genocide or war crimes.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Professor Michael Reisman of Yale said: ``In the past a head of
state would have been given broad immunity for acts committed while
he was head of state. But international law has moved steadily in
the direction of assigning personal responsibility to such
officials for grave violations of human rights or the law of war.''
</P>
<P>
   Spain's contention that it has the authority to interrogate and
try Pinochet is similar to the United States' argument that it can
try hijackers and terrorists for crimes committed against American
citizens abroad.
</P>
<P>
   Professor Jonathan Charney of the Vanderbilt Law School, editor
of The American Journal of International Law, noted that Pinochet
is accused of genocide, torture, and cruel and unusual punishment.
``These are considered universal crimes,'' he said.

`HENRY CLAY FRICK: AN INTIMATE PORTRAIT' _ ART AND GRIEF THEORY

(mk) 
 By JUDITH H. DOBRZYNSKI    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the month before Henry Clay Frick died in 1919, he would
descend at night from his second-floor, wood-paneled bedroom to the
ground floor of his Fifth Avenue mansion, which is today the Frick
Collection. He would sit in the dark, ashes accumulating on his
cigar, and stare at one of his many paintings, which would be lit
by only a small spotlight. After a time, he would move to another
masterpiece.
</P>
<P>
   Was this much-hated coke-and-steel baron thinking about the
money he spent amassing his renowned collection or the respect it
brought him? About his industrial legacy or his reputation as a
rabid anti-unionist? Or, perhaps, about the artists' intentions?
</P>
<P>
   None of the above, says his great-granddaughter Martha Frick
Symington Sanger. Frick, she contends in a book published last
week, was contemplating moments in his life that he had marked by
buying particular paintings, many relating to his beloved daughter
Martha, who died at age 6 after four years of a debilitating
infection. ``He was reliving his life,'' Ms. Sanger said, a life
haunted by longing for Martha, whose likeness he even reproduced on
his checks.
</P>
<P>
   Frick's collecting, in other words, was driven by his
psychology, shaped more by his grief than by his vaunted
connoisseurship or need for status symbols.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Sanger's thesis stands in stark contrast to the traditional
view, as stated in ``Art in the Frick Collection'' (Frick/Abrams,
1996), which emphasizes her great-grandfather's discriminating eye
and credits him as the prototype for many great American
collectors.
</P>
<P>
   ``This book breaks the rules,'' Ms. Sanger said, ``and an art
historian probably couldn't write a book like this. But it makes
sense to me. I'm a family member, and I didn't have academic hoops
to jump through.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Sanger, 54, does not dispute her great-grandfather's
``natural eye for beauty,'' but she says that his artworks had more
important meanings, literally, emotionally and symbolically. In
buying them, she said one recent day as she walked around the Frick
explaining the significance of various paintings, ``he displaced
his feelings for Martha.''
</P>
<P>
   Her thesis, she said, springs from modern grief theory. ``When
mourning is unresolved, people acquire or keep `linking objects,'
something the deceased loved or had at death,'' she explained.
``One must be open and willing to do so, but you can see that the
paintings became linking objects. That's why he spent hours alone
at night with only the paintings showing.''
</P>
<P>
   To reach that conclusion, Ms. Sanger spent the last 10 years
researching her family history, poring over archives and books,
traveling to the places that figured in Frick's life and
interviewing hundreds of people. The result is ``Henry Clay Frick:
An Intimate Portrait'' (Abbeville Press), a 600-page tome that
weighs 7 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike previous biographies of Frick, Ms. Sanger's book goes
beyond his business career and delves into his personal life. The
defining moment, she argues, occurred four years after Martha's
1891 death and three years after Frick survived an assassination
attempt that evoked, he later claimed, an apparition of Martha.
</P>
<P>
   In 1895, in a delayed reaction to those events, Frick had a
nervous breakdown. Though he had bought a few paintings each year
beginning in 1881, he suddenly began to collect at a feverish pace.
That July, on the 10th anniversary of Martha's birth, he bought
Bouguereau's ``Mischievous Girl,'' a portrait resembling Martha.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was the moment his collection pattern was established,''
Ms. Sanger said. Rembrandt's ``Polish Rider,'' for example, recalls
Frick's journeys on his gray horse, Billy, through Pennsylvania's
coal bluffs early in his career, she said, while El Greco's
``Purification of the Temple,'' in which Jesus drives out the
money-changers, commemorates Frick's violent victory over the
unions at the Homestead steel mill.
</P>
<P>
   His second daughter, Helen Clay Frick, on whom he grew
increasingly dependent as his wife, Adelaide, suffered from severe
depression, continued her father's pattern until her death in 1985,
Ms. Sanger said. Helen was responsible, for example, for buying
Bastiani's ``Adoration of Magi,'' the only purchase made during
1935, the 50th anniversary of Martha's birth. ``Martha was the
adored child,'' Ms. Sanger said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Sanger seems an unlikely source of such a groundbreaking
thesis. She freely declares that she dropped out of junior college
and lacks an author's credentials. ``I never wrote a book,'' she
said, ``I never read a book.'' Instead, she married, raised three
daughters, raced championship horses and served as steward for the
National Steeplechase and Hunt Association.
</P>
<P>
   Now divorced and living in Stevenson, Md., she started
researching her family history as therapy, as a need to understand
the alcoholism among family members, including her mother, for more
than 100 years.
</P>
<P>
   And she had her own demon to exorcise. It is no accident, she
was told, that she is the namesake of Frick's tragic daughter,
which was also her mother's name. As the third daughter of parents
who wanted a boy, she said, ``I was the cursed child and the spare
child.''
</P>
<P>
   Growing up, Ms. Sanger said she was given a ``sainted view'' of
Frick. So she set out to explore him ``as a person.'' Her thesis
began to dawn on her when she visited his birthplace in West
Overton, Pa. ``I happened to stand at the window,'' she recounted,
``and I thought `that looks like the Rousseau in the Frick,''' a
reference to ``The Village of Becquigny.''
</P>
<P>
   A little later, she journeyed to Salem, Ore., where she
interviewed the son of one of Frick's tutors. He had a photograph
of Frick holding Martha's dog that was not in the family archives.
``It jumped out at me,'' Ms. Sanger recalled, because it mimicked a
painting by George Romney of Lady Hamilton holding a dog, which
Frick bought in 1904.
</P>
<P>
   ``I discovered the fact that Lady Hamilton was the same age in
the painting as Martha would have been'' in 1904, Ms. Sanger said.
``This painting was at the foot of his bed when he died.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The other painting in his bedroom was also telling, she said.
Sir Thomas Lawrence's ``Miss Louisa Murray'' also looks like
Martha, but is somewhat unnatural. ``It's disturbing,
apparition-like,'' Ms. Sanger maintains, and it demonstrates to her
that Frick's ``feelings vibrate from idealism to nightmare, from
the beautiful child to the demonic Martha that haunts him.'' The
painting has never been on view, Ms. Sanger said, ``but it's one of
the most important paintings in the collection as far as the family
is concerned.''
</P>
<P>
   The family, according to Ms. Sanger's older sister Helen Clay
Chace, largely subscribes to the book's analysis.
</P>
<P>
   After seeing the Romney portrait and ``Becquigny,'' Ms. Sanger's
work gathered speed. ``It was like cracking a code,'' she said,
``and once I got it, painting after painting began to reveal
itself.''
</P>
<P>
   Frick, who was trained as an accountant, wrote virtually nothing
about his paintings, but he did enter the date of his purchases in
an account book.
</P>
<P>
   ``I found the language,'' she said, ``the paintings that turn up
on anniversaries and so on.''
</P>
<P>
   For example, he bought Millet's ``Woman Sewing by Lamplight,'' a
portrait Ms. Sanger believes recalls Frick's early life, shortly
after his mother died. (He placed it opposite ``Becquigny.'') He
acquired John Hopner's ``Ladies Sarah and Catherine Bligh,'' which
resembles his wife and her sister, Attie, just after Attie died.
</P>
<P>
   Four months before his death in 1919, and just after the July
anniversary of Martha's death, Frick bought Vermeer's ``Mistress
and Maid.'' It depicts a woman interrupted by the delivery of an
obviously disturbing letter from her servant, and Ms. Sanger says
it refers to the frantic correspondence between Frick and his wife
as Martha lay dying. The jeweled casket in the painting is like
Martha's jeweled casket.
</P>
<P>
   ``One or two paintings would be a shaky case,'' Ms. Sanger
asserted, ``but the entire collection speaks to his psychology.''
Ms. Sanger said that art in Frick's former home in Pittsburgh,
Clayton, also supports her thesis. ``It's a shrine to Martha.''
</P>
<P>
   Paradoxically, it is the sweeping case Ms. Sanger constructs
that prompts some skepticism. At a book party for her this month,
one art expert who insisted on anonymity said he could believe the
grief connection for some paintings, but not for most of it, as Ms.
Sanger posits.
</P>
<P>
   And among the early reviews, Publisher's Weekly also suggested
that the book did not tell the whole story behind Frick's
collecting, although other trade magazines praise the book as well
written and well documented.
</P>
<P>
   Answering the skeptics, Ms. Sanger said she was the first person
to have access to the diaries, account books, photo albums, letters
and other elements in family archives. And her thesis, she said,
``makes sense to people who've lost a child, who are familiar with
art therapy or who carry a troubled family history. Those people
who don't understand how people can relate to art will have trouble
with it.''
</P>
<P>
   In any case, the book has lifted a weight for her. ``Writing is
very cathartic,'' she said, adding that she has now turned her
attention to her mother, who died a few years ago. ``My next book
will be about the daughter's search for the mother.''

JOHNSON TALKS, STALKING THE LIMELIGHT
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: N.Y., N.J., Mass., Calif., Ariz., Fla.)   (jw) 
 By GERALD ESKENAZI    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   All Keyshawn Johnson has ever wanted is to be the star.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you think that just because I haven't done it on `Monday
Night Football,' I haven't done it?'' the Jets receiver asks.
</P>
<P>
   He knows the answer. He smiles.
</P>
<P>
   It has been six years since the Jets have been considered good
enough to get on the Monday night schedule. That was so long ago in
football terms that only two players on their roster have played in
a Monday night game. But Johnson and his teammates will get their
chance Monday when they face the New England Patriots in Foxboro,
Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson may have had something to do with getting them into a
Monday night game in his third season, but he looks at it as merely
a chance for most of America to see what he can do. It is not a big
game for him _ it is a big game for everyone watching.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've played well on national TV,'' he said. ``I've done well
on regional games. If you took the San Francisco game and put it on
Monday night, people would go, `Ooh!' ''
</P>
<P>
   In the season opener against the 49ers, Johnson snared nine
passes for 126 yards and two touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   ``What about my rookie year at Arizona?'' he asked, referring to
his seven receptions for 94 yards and a touchdown in the one game
the Jets won that season. ``Or the over-the-shoulder, one-handed
catch against Miami last year?'' he continued. ``If it was on
Monday night, would people talk about it as the greatest catch of
all time?''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, Johnson believes he has already done the great
things. Now it is time for everyone else to recognize it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe the stage is set,'' he said. ``I don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   Words aside, he has accomplished many things in two-plus
seasons:
</P>
<P>
   _ His five receiving touchdowns this season are tied for the
American Football Conference lead.
</P>
<P>
   _ In his only two prime-time appearances, both on Sunday nights
over the TNT cable network, he has a total 14 catches for 136 yards
and a touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   _ In four starts against the Patriots, he has caught 21 passes,
produced 263 yards and scored twice.
</P>
<P>
   _ He has more receptions (157) than any other receiver has had
in his first 35 games.
</P>
<P>
   ``People heard about me, maybe, but did they know about me
before the Rose Bowl?'' he asked as he considered the impact of
national television on a career. ``Was I any better because of the
Rose Bowl?''
</P>
<P>
   In that 1996 game against Northwestern, he grabbed 12 passes for
a Rose Bowl record 216 yards and one touchdown. It was his eighth
performance of at least 100 receiving yards that season for
Southern California. Three and a half months later, the Jets made
him the overall No. 1 pick in the draft.
</P>
<P>
   ``What makes people think you're the best?'' he asked
rhetorically. ``Do you get more credit if you haven't written a
book?''
</P>
<P>
   In that once infamous and now largely forgotten book about his
rookie season (''Just Give Me the Damn Ball!''), Johnson besmirched
quarterback Neil O'Donnell as a ``stiff puppet.''
</P>
<P>
   As a result of the book, and his own exuberance when talking
about himself, people raised the bar in assessing Johnson's
accomplishments. Until he did it, and did it big, many people were
withholding judgment.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, in 35 games as a pro, he ranks second only to Jerry Rice in
touchdowns (18) and yards (2,141).
</P>
<P>
   And Johnson loves the current quarterback duo of Vinny
Testaverde and Glenn Foley, explaining, ``They know who the person
is to get the ball to.''
</P>
<P>
   Testaverde says he is not concerned with what the Patriots are
doing. He notes that he also has such offensive threats as Johnson
and running back Curtis Martin and says, ``If we do our job well,
we'll succeed.''
</P>
<P>
   Foley, who has been demoted but always sought Johnson out, is
fond of saying, ``Keyshawn is the first guy I think of.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson is a talker on the field, although he usually says the
defender starts the talk. It's when he responds that the shouting
escalates.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the tremendous year that Patriots cornerback Ty Law
has had _ including four interceptions _ Johnson responded: ``What
makes him having a tremendous year? Who did he get the
interceptions against? Were there any Hail Mary's in there?''
</P>
<P>
   As for his own touchdowns, Johnson said: ``Where did my five
touchdowns come _ in garbage time? I don't want the rock in garbage
time.''
</P>
<P>
   He laughs off defenders such as the Giants' Tito Wooten, who
said after a preseason game that Johnson had bragged of being a
gang member. Or Terrell Buckley of the Dolphins, who tossed an
end-zone pylon after Johnson scored against him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm always smiling at them and having fun,'' Johnson said.
``Even when Terrell Buckley threw that pylon at me, I smiled.''
</P>
<P>
   The 6-foot-3-inch, 215-pound Johnson added: ``Most people start
talking to me. I don't need to talk to anyone. It's just like I
don't need steroids to dominate you.''
</P>
<P>
   A smile has always been his umbrella against those he believes
do not understand him, or do not believe in him, or want him to
fail.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always been like that,'' Johnson said. ``A lot of times
in my life people didn't take me seriously. They didn't think I'd
go to college, or they didn't think I'd graduate. So I laugh. I
don't want to make the people seem foolish. I just want them to
know, it's a foolish thing to think I can't do something.''
</P>
<P>
   As he said, the stage is set. &QL;

DRUG-DISTRIBUTION GIANT TO BUY DATA FIRM 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ga., Calif.)  (jw) 
 By BARNABY J. FEDER    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   McKesson Corp., the nation's largest drug distributor, said late
Sunday that it would buy HBO &AMP; Co., the nation's largest supplier
of computerized patient-monitoring systems in a stock swap valued
at about $14 billion.
</P>
<P>
   McKesson HBOC, as the company will be called, expects to be the
nation's leading health care services company when the deal is
completed next spring. It will supply drugs and services to 5,000
hospitals, 25,000 retail pharmacies, 10,000 extended-care sites and
35,000 physicians' groups.
</P>
<P>
   The two companies had tried to reach a merger agreement this
summer, but the deal fell apart when word leaked out and HBO's
shares fell sharply. Since then, both had made other deals in the
rapidly consolidating drug industry, including HBO's announcement
last month that it would acquire Access Health Inc. in a $1 billion
stock swap that would extend its reach into patient-management
systems for insurers and managed care companies.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Pulido, the president and chief executive of McKesson, said
the two companies resumed bargaining after customers kept urging
them to combine.
</P>
<P>
   The two companies had tried to reach a merger agreement this
summer, but the deal fell apart when word leaked out and HBO's
shares fell sharply. Since then, both had made other deals in the
rapidly consolidating drug industry, including HBO's announcement
late last month that it would acquire Access Health Inc. in a stock
swap that would extend its reach into patient-management systems
for health insurers and managed-care companies. Such systems help
insurers decide whether to authorize hospitalization for patients
and provide telephone counseling for patients.
</P>
<P>
   Pulido said the two companies went back to the bargaining table
after customers kept urging them to combine.
</P>
<P>
   The deal will give stockholders of HBO, based in Atlanta, 0.37
share of McKesson for each of their shares. McKesson is based in
San Francisco. The price represents an 11 percent premium over
HBO's closing price of 29 9/16 Friday.
</P>
<P>
   McKesson, based in San Francisco, expects the deal to begin
adding to earnings in its first year because of an estimated $75
million gain from what it described as `synergies and cross-selling
opportunities. HBO has 350 employees selling to hospitals compared
to just 50 for McKesson while McKesson's 550 strong sales force
calling on physicians dwarfs HBO's group of 50.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's low hanging fruit,'' said Pulido of the opportunities
to sell each other's products and services. Pulido will be chief
executive of the merged company. Charles McCall, now chairman,
chief executive and president of HBO, will become chairman.
</P>
<P>
   The deal came shortly after McKesson's major rival, Cardinal
Health Inc., had diversified by acquiring Allegiance Corp., a major
distributor of hospital supplies.
</P>
<P>
   Both Cardinal and McKesson had announced deals this year to
acquire other large drug distributors only to have those plans
scuttled by federal antitrust regulators. Cardinal wanted to
acquire Bergen Brunswig, and McKesson, a smaller rival called
AmeriSource Health, but the Federal Trade Commission was worried
that consumers would be hurt by having just two companies control
80 percent of drug distribution.
</P>
<P>
   McKesson is far larger than HBO, with $19.7 billion in revenues
in the twelve months ending Sept. 30 compared with $1.46 billion
for HBO. But HBO has been growing faster and far more profitable.
</P>
<P>
   McKesson traces its history to a Manhattan drugstore opened in
1833 by John McKesson. In addition to distributing drugs, McKesson
distributes robotic drug handling systems and management services
to pharmacies. It became the nation's largest distributor of
surgical supplies last year by acquiring General Medical for $775
million. Its McKesson Water Products subsidiary, which owns the
Alhambra and Crystal brands, is the third largest marketer of
bottled water behind Nestle and Suntory.
</P>
<P>
   HBO was founded in 1974 as the outgrowth of an attempt by a
group of hospitals in central Illinois to develop a shared patient
accounting system. Its name reflects those of its founders, Walter
Huff, Bruce Barrington and Richard Owens.
</P>
<P>
   Pulido said the new company would be able to help customers
reduce $180 billion spent annually on administrative costs and save
$330 billion by avoiding inappropriate care to patients because of
inadequate information about their status or unavailability of the
most appropriate treatment.

REVITALIZED GIANTS END WEEKS OF MISADVENTURE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By BILL PENNINGTON    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ It all looked so familiar at Giants
Stadium on Sunday _ eight Giants sacks, three long Giants scoring
drives, 141 yards rushing, no turnovers and three turnovers forced.
</P>
<P>
   Surely, Giants fans recognized this team.
</P>
<P>
   But what were the efficient, prosperous New York Giants of last
year doing interrupting the budding misadventure of this year's
team?
</P>
<P>
   Who were these guys? And why did it take them six games to come
out of hiding?
</P>
<P>
   The Giants' 34-7 rout of the Arizona Cardinals on Sunday
afternoon saved the Giants from an undignified early season
collapse.
</P>
<P>
   In victory, the Giants (3-4) turned back the clock, and not a
minute too soon, because now they have a future again. Now they
trail the first-place Dallas Cowboys by just one game in the
National Football Conference East.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what got us back in sync and I'm not going to
analyze it,'' Giants coach Jim Fassel said in the wake of his
team's first victory this month. As Fassel spoke, he looked more
relieved than happy, the dazed look that has graced his face for
three weeks having taken its leave.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe it's a six-game syndrome,'' he said. ``It took us that
long to really get things going last year. I want to believe we've
found the formula again this time.''
</P>
<P>
   The formula was on display from the first play of the game when
Giants defensive end Michael Strahan sacked Arizona quarterback
Jake Plummer. For most of the succeeding three hours, the Giants
looked better than they had in any game this year.
</P>
<P>
   Running back Gary Brown, mysteriously underused in the
preseason, gained 108 yards on 24 carries. Quarterback Danny Kanell
threw for a career-high 259 yards and three touchdowns. The
maligned offensive line dominated the Cardinals' vaunted defensive
front, a brilliant performance by this faceless unit.
</P>
<P>
   The patchwork, injury-plagued secondary made two interceptions.
The nickel linebacker Scott Galyon had a sack, a forced fumble and
a fumble recovery _ on one play.
</P>
<P>
   And the Giants offense's best friend from a year ago _ defensive
pass interference _ returned Sunday. The Cardinals (3-4) were
whistled for pass interference three times in the first half, which
helped the Giants take a 14-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first time the Giants had even a touchdown lead in 10
quarters.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a game about which team gets its confidence first,''
Strahan said. ``We jumped on them early. We played boldly right
from the beginning.''
</P>
<P>
   Several Giants credited Fassel with instilling that
aggressiveness in the team. Fassel had addressed his players
Saturday night, telling them to ``have fun in the game.''
</P>
<P>
   As football speeches go, it was uncommon. There was less of the
usual talk about execution and more talk about how the Giants
should enjoy themselves and be thankful they play a game for a
living.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told them that we're the envy of everybody,'' Fassel said.
``People love what we do. They'd love to be professional football
players or coaches. We have no reason to walk around with our chins
down.''
</P>
<P>
   Offensive tackle Scott Gragg said: ``I think what the coach said
took the knot out of our stomachs. When you lose, you carry that
knot in your stomach around with you and it gets hard to relax and
play. But he made us realize that what we do is a dream for most
people. We took advantage of the opportunity when we could.''
</P>
<P>
   With a true commitment to establishing the running game, the
Giants averaged 3.8 yards on 37 carries _ and Brown averaged 4.5
yards on his 24 carries.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants had been averaging 3.1 yards a carry, down from 3.8
yards a carry last season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did better on the ground because the offensive line came
off the ball first,'' Fassel said. ``It's about our mental edge in
the game.''
</P>
<P>
   The Giants got an early, first-quarter psychological boost when
they faced a fourth-and-1 at the goal line. Fassel decided to go
for it, calling a play that had fullback Charles Way lined up at
the end of the offensive line, almost as a third tight end.
</P>
<P>
   Before the Cardinals had set their defense, Kanell snapped the
ball, and then quickly fired a touchdown pass to Way.
</P>
<P>
   Brown ended the Giants' next possession with a 1-yard touchdown
_ the second consecutive 11-play Giants scoring drive.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants' defense, still the strength of the team, continued
to control the Cardinals' offense, with the defensive front four of
Strahan, Chad Bratzke, Keith Hamilton and Robert Harris playing its
best game of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Harris was back after missing three games with a chest-muscle
strain and led the team in tackles with nine and sacks with 2{.
Hamilton seemed energized by Harris' presence, playing his
strongest game of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Kanell staked the Giants to a 17-7 lead and the Giants' pressure
on Plummer yielded an interception by Percy Ellsworth. That led to
Brad Daluiso's 34-yard field goal.
</P>
<P>
   The decisive, 80-yard drive came a few minutes later when the
Giants mixed running and passing plays as they marched to the
Cardinals' 19-yard line.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals had been blitzing Kanell frequently, and on
third-and-2, they sent a host of players at Kanell again.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants quarterback, who had played two successive poor
games, threw quickly to Chris Calloway over the middle. Calloway
spun away from one defender and split three others in a dash into
the end zone. Kanell added a third touchdown pass _ this one to the
ever-improving Amani Toomer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like a weight has been lifted off the offense's
shoulders,'' Kanell said. ``I was miserable. I was struggling and
playing poorly. The schedule is only going to get tougher, so we
definitely needed to give ourselves something to get our momentum
going.''
</P>
<P>
   What the Giants did was give themselves a history lesson in
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   As Calloway, with a slightly quizzical expression, said Sunday,
``You know, it looked a lot like last year out there.''

   NEW YORK _
</P>
<P>
   Dear Diary:
</P>
<P>
   I recently took my 3-year-old daughter, Dorielle, to Harry's
Shoe Store on Broadway and 83rd Street to buy her first Mary Janes.
As I was paying for them, the clerk gave her a green balloon with
the store name on it. I wanted to tie the string of the balloon to
her wrist, but being an independent young lady, she insisted on
holding it in her hand.
</P>
<P>
   We started walking to the next corner, to Barnes &AMP; Noble for
some books, when a breeze lifted the balloon. Dorielle was in
tears, crying inconsolably as she watched it go higher and higher.
I explained the ways of balloons, and pointed out that next time
she should listen to me.
</P>
<P>
   We went up to the children's section of the bookstore, on the
second floor, Dorielle still not consoled. A woman came up and
asked, ``Are you the little girl who lost her balloon?'' and handed
her an identical one from the same shoe store.
</P>
<P>
   How did the woman know what happened, I asked. She said she had
been sitting in her car in front of the shoe store and when she saw
what happened, ran in and got another balloon. As she saw the
direction we were headed, she guessed we might be looking at
children's books.
</P>
<P>
   She left one happy child and one flabbergasted mother.
</P>

   _ REBECCA SCHRAM ZAFRANY
</P>
<P>
   Rose Rudnitski returned on an overnight flight from a trip to
Brazil and got off the shuttle bus at the long-term parking lot at
Kennedy International Airport. When she arrived at her car, she
discovered her ignition and trunk keys prominently displayed on top
of the car trunk. They had apparently fallen off her key ring when
she parked and, as it was a rainy day when she left and she had
been in a rush, she hadn't noticed. Obviously, someone walking by
had spotted the keys on the ground and carefully put them in a more
noticeable position. Who would believe that the car remained
undisturbed? Call it a true New York miracle.

the recent ``Art of the Motorcycle'' exhibition: ``I always thought
this would make a good garage.''

   My daughter Ellen recently attended her first evening parenting
class. The following afternoon she was running errands and told her
4-year-old son, Matthew, to get in the car and put on his seat
belt. He refused to put on the belt. After some failed
negotiations, my daughter became frustrated and started screaming
at him. Matthew looked at her and announced, ``You really didn't
learn anything from your class last night.''

   As a newly arrived young immigrant in New York several years
ago, I was horrified at the notices I saw all over the city. It was
when terrorism in Ireland was a day-to-day reality and well before
talk of a peace treaty. We had been brought up with stories of
money being sent from America to help support the IRA.
</P>
<P>
   I had no idea of the extent of the support and how much money
must have been involved until I saw notices in every bank window to
``put your money into an IRA account.''
</P>
<P>
   I was sick about it and couldn't inquire of anyone as I was an
illegal immigrant at the time. I felt I must be the only person in
the city who didn't support the IRA. I wrote home telling my family
that things were much worse than we imagined.
</P>
<P>
   When I became legal and began working in a publishing firm,
someone in personnel asked me to fill in a form that had the
ominous question: ``Do you want to put money into an IRA account?''
I finally found out what it was all about.

up and take a bus. She was short a dime, and asked a young woman
standing in front of her whether the drivers took pennies. The
woman didn't know but another woman in line, who had heard the
exchange, pressed a dime in her hand and refused the pennies in
exchange. Just then Ms. Rudnick spotted a cab a short way down the
block and, still clutching her donated dime, she ran for it. As the

   Dear Diary:

<P>
   A recent pleasant day at noon. I sat on a bench facing the
Hudson River at Battery Park City. As I unwrapped my sandwich, a
bird, chirping loudly, landed on the railing in front of me. I
threw a small portion of focaccia to the pavement. The bird
approached it, pecked at the morsel several times and flew away. I
continued eating, offended that my gourmet sandwich was seemingly
not good enough for this sparrow.
</P>
<P>
   A moment later, the same bird returned with its baby, barely old
enough to fly. The mother bird proceeded to pull small pieces from
the morsel and place them in the young bird's open beak, feeding
the baby before helping herself. Then, apparently satisfied, the
two flew away. A male sparrow, who had been watching from the
sidelines, then felt entitled to come over and help himself to what
was left.
</P>
<P>
   It was a delicious noon meal for all of us.

INDIA AND PAKISTAN AGREE TO KEEP TALKING ON NUCLEAR WEAPONS
</HEADLINE>
   (jw)

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan _ On the third and final day of talks
between Indian and Pakistani diplomats, the world's two newest
nuclear powers announced Sunday that they had agreed only to keep
talking to each other about ways to reduce the risk of nuclear
conflict between them.
</P>
<P>
   The foreign secretaries of the rival nations presented proposals
designed to help dispel the mistrust and enmity that have
characterized their relationship since British India was divided
into Pakistan and India 51 years ago. But no agreement was reached
on even on the most modest of them.
</P>
<P>
   The two sides said they would meet again in New Delhi in
February to continue the conversation and claimed a small victory
from the simple fact that they have been sitting down in the same
room to discuss their differences.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since India, and then Pakistan, exploded nuclear devices in
May, the other nuclear powers have been putting pressure on them to
restart talks that stalled a year ago. Pakistanis themselves have
repeatedly said Kashmir, a predominantly Muslim territory in the
Himalayas that both countries claim, could become a nuclear flash
point.
</P>
<P>
   Pakistan controls a sliver of Kashmir and India most of the
rest, and the countries regularly exchange fire across the line
that divides the parts of Kashmir that each controls. India and
Pakistan have fought three wars, two of them over Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
   India, which has already committed itself to a policy of no
first use of nuclear weapons, asked Pakistan to adopt the same
doctrine, an Indian official said, speaking on the condition of
anonymity. But Pakistan refused on grounds that it needs the
nuclear threat to counter India's superior conventional military
forces.
</P>
<P>
   Pakistan in turn proposed that the two nations sign a
nonaggression pact, with a provision to set up a process for the
resolution of disputes, with third-party mediation in cases
Pakistan and India could not resolve on their own. But India, which
has ruled out international mediation on Kashmir, rejected the
Pakistani proposal.

MALE DIRECTOR OF BATTERED WOMEN'S SHELTER IS LET GO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANNE E. KORNBLUT  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Six months after a bitter ideological dispute ripped
through a prominent Cape Cod domestic violence agency, the central
controversy _ whether a man should run the place _ has been
resolved, at least for now.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Costa, the state's first male director of a battered
women's shelter, has been asked to leave Independence House by Nov.
13. Despite earlier accusations that the agency betrayed its
feminist roots by appointing a man, board chairwoman Christine
Kesten said his dismissal was unrelated to the public outcry, and
was, in fact, ``not an issue of sex at all.''
</P>
<P>
   But it may be a harbinger of further trouble.
</P>
<P>
   The state Department of Public Health announced last month the
cancellation of a $111,000 contract for rape counseling services at
the Hyannis-based agency, citing concerns over inadequate staffing
and the high turnover rate of employees.
</P>
<P>
   The state Department of Social Services also reviewed its
contract with Independence House recently, although Kesten said
that deal is still ``in place.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This agency has had a lot of history,'' Kesten said Sunday,
``and it all seems to have come to a head.''
</P>
<P>
   Marianne Milton, a board member who quit over Costa's hiring,
said the half-year ordeal had ``done so much damage to the
agency.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just very sorry this had to happen,'' she said. ``I just
hope they are going to be able to find a direction.''
</P>
<P>
   Many members of the community and former board members admitted
some of the agency's troubles predated the recent flap. But it was,
by most accounts, Costa's appointment in May that underscored deep
rifts among those in charge of the $1 million-a-year domestic
violence operation, believed to be the largest on Cape Cod.
</P>
<P>
   Founded in the early 1980s as a grass-roots ``safe house'' for
battered women, Independence House blossomed into a large-scale
organization serving as many as 1,000 women a month with both its
shelter and its 24-hour counseling hotline.
</P>
<P>
   When Costa was appointed, it was with the idea that he would
serve as a business organizer and fund-raiser, a role made
necessary by the growing number of staff members and clients,
Kesten said at the time. Nearly 20 percent of the agency's budget
is dependent on outside fund-raising, board members said.
</P>
<P>
   But dissent began even before Costa was sitting in the
$45,000-a-year slot.
</P>
<P>
   Several board members complained that he lacked experience as a
hands-on counselor. The board's own president, Helen Goolishian,
argued that when a battered woman walks into a shelter, ``the last
thing she wants to see is a man.''
</P>
<P>
   Goolishian, along with three other board members, resigned after
Costa's appointment.
</P>
<P>
   Costa, while admitting that his presence split opinion on the
board of directors, insisted in an interview at the time that there
was no negative impact on the agency itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're all doing our jobs,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   On Oct. 8, after Costa's six-month probationary period ended,
the nine-member board of directors voted unanimously not to offer
him a full contract. It was a surprising about-face for the board,
which had vehemently supported Costa at the time of his
appointment; but, according to Kesten, ``it was a mutual
decision.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he would like to pursue other interests, too,'' she
said. ``I don't really want to go into every detail.''
</P>
<P>
   Attempts to reach Costa Sunday were unsuccessful.
</P>
<P>
   Peggy Wilbur, a former clinical director, has assumed the role
of interim director while a nationwide search is conducted to find
a permanent one _ and eventually, the board hopes, permanent
stability.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could fill a room with the people who are upset with
Independence House,'' said Gerry Garvey, executive director of the
neighboring New Bedford Women's Center. ``But you could fill a
stadium with women whose lives were saved by Independence House.
I'm feeling like, enough is enough.''

REFORM LAWS TEST GUBERNATORIAL CANDIDATES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SCOT LEHIGH  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ In six weeks, a central wrangling point of last week's
gubernatorial debate takes on a concrete reality, when as many as
6,000 of the state's welfare families hit the two-year aid limit.
</P>
<P>
   That adds urgency to a question that has bedeviled policy makers
for 25 years: What's the best way to move welfare recipients off
the rolls and into jobs that pay enough to support their families?
</P>
<P>
   Acting Governor Paul Cellucci, the Republican incumbent, accuses
Attorney General Scott Harshbarger, the Democratic nominee, of
wanting to weaken the state's law, which imposes a two-year time
limit on recipients and requires that some work 20 hours a week to
receive their benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Harshbarger says the law is overly rigid, and in the debate said
it reflected an ``anti-woman, anti-child'' bias by the acting
governor.
</P>
<P>
   Harshbarger would modify the law to let education and training
programs count toward the 20-hour-a-week requirement and to allow
more extensions beyond the two-year time limit.
</P>
<P>
   That difference reflects a longtime public-policy debate:
whether the best approach is to require recipients to work
immediately, even if in community service jobs, or to leave them
free to pursue education or training in the hope they will find
better jobs later.
</P>
<P>
   ``Education and training is important, but it is just no
substitute for a job,'' said Andy Antrobus, campaign spokesman for
Cellucci. ``Scott Harshbarger thinks it's OK for welfare recipients
to not have to work. Governor Cellucci thinks that welfare
recipients, just like everyone else, should have to work and seek
out that education and training in addition to their jobs, not
instead of their jobs.''
</P>
<P>
   Harshbarger says that Cellucci ignores the economic realities
facing welfare recipients. ``The fact that Paul Cellucci would turn
his back on women looking to learn new skills, provide for their
children, and move up the economic ladder _ and ignore the
recommendation of his hand-picked MassJobs Council _ speaks volumes
about his values and leadership,'' Harshbarger said.
</P>
<P>
   Results so far in other states suggest that a strong emphasis on
finding employment quickly has paid off _ but that rigid deadlines
can indeed be counterproductive.
</P>
<P>
   Cellucci and former governor William F. Weld made the work-first
approach the cornerstone of their welfare philosophy. And based on
raw numbers alone, that approach can claim some real successes.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Department of Transitional Assistance, the
number of families on Transitional Aid to Families with Dependent
Children, as AFDC is now called, has declined from 102,993 to
40,963 since the welfare reform law was passed in February 1995.
</P>
<P>
   About half of those who have left the rolls have found jobs, DTA
says.
</P>
<P>
   But at what level of pay?
</P>
<P>
   The average starting wage for welfare recipients who have
participated in some sort of education or training program is $7.77
an hour. That's $15,540 a year, assuming 50 40-hour work weeks. For
those who haven't gone through education and training, the average
falls to $7.10 an hour, or $14,200 per year.
</P>
<P>
   Those facts suggest education and training means a $1,340-a-year
boost, hiking average yearly wages by more than 9 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Deborah Harris, a staff attorney at the Massachusetts Law Reform
Institute, says a 35-hour week is more typical. If so, that means
education and training could make the difference between a yearly
wage of $12,425 _ more than $1,000 below the $13,650 poverty level
for a family of three _ and $13,597.
</P>
<P>
   Those are wages for people who have left the rolls before the
deadline.
</P>
<P>
   It remains to be seen what will happen with the members of the
time-limted group _ able-bodied recipients whose children are 2 or
older _ who have been unable to find work so far.
</P>
<P>
   Dick Powers, spokesman for DTA, says that based on the
experience in other states, DTA expects about half that group _
2,000 to 3,000 _ to apply for extensions. More will hit the
deadline each month thereafter.
</P>
<P>
   In a position paper released Thursday, Harshbarger said he would
``keep in place and enforce the two-year time limit for welfare.''
</P>
<P>
   But he also favors adding extensions, on a case-by-case basis,
for victims of domestic violence and recipients ``enrolled in
qualified education and training programs.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Cellucci blasted Harshbarger for favoring exceptions to
the two-year limit, last month DTA announced its own rules for
waiving the time limit.
</P>
<P>
   Those regulations allow extensions for six possible reasons,
including a recipient's recent work history, the availability of
job opportunities and child care, and their efforts to find work.
Harshbarger also backs those reasons for extensions, said spokesman
Dwight Robson.
</P>
<P>
   A second difference between the candidates is whether education
or training should count toward the 20-hour weekly work requirement
that able-bodied welfare recipients with school-age children must
comply with to receive benefits.
</P>
<P>
   There are 10,277 recipients covered by that requirement.
</P>
<P>
   Of that group, only 800 are also participating in any sort of
education or training program. With 44 percent of welfare
recipients lacking high school degrees, their champions say they
could significantly raise their earning potential through education
and training.
</P>
<P>
   DTA's own wage statistics support that contention.
</P>
<P>
   But Harris says that it can be just too difficult to fulfill the
weekly work requirement and also participate in a training program.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you are a low-income parent and you have school-age kids,
and you don't have a washer or a dryer, so you have to go to the
laundromat, and you have to spend time going to the food pantries
because your food stamps don't last the whole month, and you don't
have a car, so you have to spend a lot of time on public
transportation getting to and from work, there are just not enough
hours in the week to do both, unless you are a supermom,'' said
Harris.
</P>
<P>
   Oregon, whose welfare-to-work program has been hailed as one of
the nation's most successful by the widely respected Manpower
Demonstration Research Corp., doesn't have either a work
requirement or a hard deadline for recipients participating in the
job-search program.
</P>
<P>
   The philosophy there is that ``as long as people are doing what
we ask them to do, the state ought not to put an end to benefits,''
said James Neely, deputy administrator of Oregon's Adult and Family
Services Division.
</P>
<P>
   And though Oregon does put a priority on finding work, it offers
education and training to recipients who are having trouble finding
jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``You really have to take an empirical approach, to look at why
people aren't being employed, and provide services to address it,''
said Neely.
</P>
<P>
   Nor has that program suffered as a result of its lack of rigid
deadlines. Neely says the welfare rolls have dropped from 44,000
families in March 1994 to about 17,500 today, a 60 percent
reduction that outstrips the decline of 40 percent under the
Massachusetts law.
</P>
<P>
   Last May, eight members of the MassJobs Council, noting that
only 2.8 percent of welfare recipients were taking adult education
classes, even though more than 40 percent lacked high school
educations, recommended counting education and training as part of
the work requirement.
</P>
<P>
   Cellucci responded by dismissing the advisory board members.
Harshbarger, by contrast, agreed with the recommendation.
</P>
<P>
   Each man can find some solace in the judgment of the leading
experts.
</P>
<P>
   In an August guest column in the Washington Post, Judith Gueron
and Amy Brown, president and senior operations associate at the
Manpower organization, which has studied welfare policy for 25
years, came down in favor of stressing that recipients find work
quickly _ but also allowing some flexibility for education and
training.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most successful programs our organization has studied have
used balanced approaches that emphasized the importance of getting
a job quickly but understood that some recipients need more than
just a resume and a push,'' they wrote.

   The Padres came to Yankee Stadium and paid their proper
respects. Really, they did. Tony Gwynn said all the right things
after his first visit to Monument Park. Greg Vaughn didn't thumb
his nose at George Steinbrenner's baseball people and ask how many
Yankees hit 50 home runs this season. Jim Leyritz stepped right
back into place with his former teammates by scrawling Darryl
Strawberry's No. 39 onto his cap. Bruce Bochy spoke of Joe Torre in
a mentor/role model tone.
</P>
<P>
   These very nice men brought the low humidity from their weather
paradise in Southern California, apparently figuring the best way
to compete with the Yankees was to create a climate of mutual
respect. Don't rock the team of destiny, just poke some holes and
see if it starts losing air. Then the Yankees deflated the Padres'
middle relief pitching Saturday night, and all of New York resumed
making plans for a parade it knows will make Sammy Sosa's look like
a pack of Waveland Avenue kids chasing one of his home runs.
</P>
<P>
   In the narrow stadium corridors early Sunday night, you could
eavesdrop on the security guys, saying everything to one another
but goodbye and have a nice winter. In the stands, the fans acted
as if the next Yankee event in New York would be along Broadway. In
Torre's pre-game news conference, he offered warm gratitude for the
Yankee fans, nearly 3 million strong this season, using the past
tense as he said, ``They have been wonderful.'' In Bochy's pre-game
news conference, the Padres' manager was asked a question about the
Yankees' Game 3 starter, David Cone, and essentially said, excuse
me, I've got another problem right now and his name is Orlando
Hernandez. He understood the implications of Game 2 in a World
Series few believed his team would win.
</P>
<P>
   Win now, or else don't plan on coming back.
</P>
<P>
   What was it that Yogi Berra once said about the late-afternoon
October outfield shadows in the south Bronx? ``It gets late early
out here,'' is the quote, according to the Yogi legend, and that is
what the Padres were facing Sunday night. It was time for them to
slow down the Yankee steamroller early, or get rolled over.
</P>
<P>
   Too many Yankee story lines _ like El Duque's dramatic arrival _
seemed to be running parallel in the direction of the desired
punctuation of this famous franchise's most decorated season. The
obsession to not waste those 114 regular-season victories, the
aching in their hearts to win it for the ailing Strawberry, the
news that Joe DiMaggio was rooting from his own hospital sick bed,
as was Andy Pettitte's father.
</P>
<P>
   In the year of major league baseball's re-emergence, the year
that one man hit 70 home runs and another hit 66, who could imagine
the San Diego Padres as the last team standing? Only Bochy, whose
job Sunday night was to look at his players and tell them they did
not have to accept what fate surely had in store for them, if Game
1 was the hint.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have seen this club rebound too many times and I think it is
a very resilient club,'' he said. ``I just think they will be fine.
Sure, it is a tough loss when you have a 5-2 lead in the first game
of the World Series, but they will put that behind them.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, these things just seem to be preordained, and it is
up to someone _ Kirk Gibson comes to mind _ to step up and
dramatically alter history's course. Kevin Brown had a chance
Saturday night, but he reportedly wasn't feeling well to start and
was certainly feeling worse after watching his bullpen surrender
home runs to Chuck Knoblauch and Tino Martinez as the Yankees
rolled a seven in the seventh inning.
</P>
<P>
   The Game 1 story lines only pointed to this season's inevitable
conclusion. Redemption for the slumping Martinez. Forgiveness for
the playoff-scarred Knoblauch. Oh, what an explosion of fury
Knoblauch might have faced had home-plate umpire Rich Garcia called
Martinez out on that 2-2, knee-high fastball that cut the plate in
half, right before Martinez struck the game-winning grand slam. In
the very next inning, Knoblauch's error allowed the Padres' sixth
run.
</P>
<P>
   As it turned out, it was just a footnote to another victorious
Yankee box score, one which included more homegrown ingenuity by
Torre. Of all players to demythologize Brown, who would have picked
the rookie leftfielder Ricky Ledee? Well, Torre, in a manner of
speaking. He started the kid who had less post-season experience
than Shane Spencer, and was rewarded with Ledee's two-run double,
another hard single and the walk that preceded Knoblauch's
game-tying homer.
</P>
<P>
   No American League manager ever pushed as many right buttons as
Joe Torre did in the summer of 1998. In the ball park that housed
David Wells' perfect game, the Yankees this season created their
own baseball paradise. Was it just coincidence that the weather was
cool and breezy, a San Diego-like 68 degrees at game time Sunday
night?

2 MOB SUSPECTS WITH SAME NAME SAY U.S. MIXED THEM UP 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Fla., N.Y.)  (js) 
 By SELWYN RAAB   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   They are cousins with the same name, Liborio Bellomo, the same
nickname, Barney, and, law enforcement authorities say, the same
occupation: mobster.
</P>
<P>
   But Liborio Salvatore Bellomo, 41, insists that he has been
subjected to horrendous prison conditions and wrongly entangled in
a New Jersey Mafia investigation because of an identification mixup
with his cousin, Liborio Thomas Bellomo. Strangely enough, Liborio
T. Bellomo, 39, agreed in an affidavit that New Jersey
investigators had the wrong Bellomo and should be focusing on him,
not his cousin.
</P>
<P>
   The complaining cousin, Liborio S. Bellomo, was described by the
FBI as the acting boss of the Genovese crime family when he pleaded
guilty in 1997 to federal extortion charges in Manhattan and was
sentenced to 10 years in prison. In April, the New Jersey attorney
general's office got a court order transferring Bellomo from the
Federal Penitentiary in Atlanta to the Mercer County Jail in
Trenton.
</P>
<P>
   The reason, New Jersey prosecutors said, was that his name
surfaced in an extortion plot and they wanted him to appear before
a grand jury. Bellomo refused to testify.
</P>
<P>
   In July his lawyer, Anthony Mautone, sought a court order to
return Bellomo to federal custody, contending that the prison
transfer violated Bellomo's constitutional rights and that the
authorities had ``erroneously confused'' the identities of the
cousins.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Mautone asserted that the imprisoned Bellomo was
confined under severe security conditions in an overcrowded cell
for 22 to 23 hours a day. Bellomo, the lawyer said, wanted to be
returned to more pleasant surroundings at a federal prison where he
had recreational and work privileges.
</P>
<P>
   There are ample reasons to confuse the two Bellomos. Their
fathers are brothers and their mothers are sisters.
</P>
<P>
   Liborio S. Bellomo, who before his conviction had homes in
Pelham Manor, N.Y., and in Bal Harbor, Fla., was listed by
prosecutors and investigators as a high-ranking capo, or captain,
in the Genovese crime family. He is known in the underworld as
Barney and Big Barney, and he is the Bellomo who is now serving a
prison term.
</P>
<P>
   Liborio T. Bellomo has been identified by federal and state
authorities as a member of the Genovese crime group who lives in
Bayside, Queens, but who is suspected of being connected to
Genovese activities in northern New Jersey. According to court
records, his nicknames are Barney and Benny. He has a federal
criminal record, according to court papers. He is free and there
are no current charges against him.
</P>
<P>
   ``There have been numerous occasions in the past,'' Liborio T.
Bellomo said in an affidavit filed in June, ``when mistakes were
made and people would incorrectly attribute to me things that were
meant for my cousin, or they would attribute to my cousin, things
meant for me.'' He noted that federal authorities in previous
criminal cases had tangled the backgrounds of the cousins.
</P>
<P>
   In seeking Liborio S. Bellomo's testimony, Robert Codey, a New
Jersey assistant attorney general, in court papers and in oral
arguments, said Bellomo's name had arisen in a racketeering
investigation of Daniel Provenzano of Upper Saddle River, N.J.
Provenzano, 35, is the nephew of Anthony Provenzano, a New Jersey
teamster official accused of being a Genovese capo, who died in
1988 while serving a federal prison term for racketeering.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Daniel Provenzano, who the authorities said was a Genovese
associate, was arrested in June 1997 on charges of trying to extort
$100,000 from the owner of an insurance brokerage firm in Franklin
Lakes, N.J. The firm's owner, Jeffrey Pumilia, had cooperated with
the authorities, who secretly recorded on videotape a meeting
Provenzano had with Pumilia and his wife, Anna, in the Pumilia home
on May 30, 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Provenzano, according to prosecutors, identified Liborio Bellomo
as the head of the Genovese crime family, referring to him on tape
as Barney, and said that Pumilia would be killed unless he turned
over $100,000 to the Genovese family.
</P>
<P>
   In a transcript of the conversation, Provenzano is quoted as
saying: ``With Barney's reputation, you got to realize something.
The guy is a stone cold killer, OK?''
</P>
<P>
   In his court arguments, Mautone, the lawyer for Liborio S.
Bellomo, maintained that his client had never met or spoken with
Provenzano and that any possible references by Provenzano concerned
his cousin, Liborio T. Bellomo. At the time of the 1997 meeting,
Liborio T. Bellomo worked for a company partly owned by Provenzano
and, in a court deposition, Liborio T. Bellomo said he had met
Pumilia.
</P>
<P>
   Mautone also said in court that Liborio S. Bellomo had been held
without bail in a Manhattan prison awaiting trial on unrelated
charges at the time of the undercover investigation of Provenzano.
</P>
<P>
   ``They used a ruse to get him to New Jersey,'' Mautone said in
an interview on Friday, referring to Liborio S. Bellomo. ``They
know he had nothing to do with the investigation and what they
really want is to rehash all that stuff from New York about his
being the alleged boss of the Genovese family.''
</P>
<P>
   Codey, the lead prosecutor in the Provenzano inquiry, said in
court papers that prosecutors were aware of the different roles of
the Bellomo cousins and had not confused their identities.
Investigators, he added, have information that Provenzano knew
Liborio S. Bellomo and had met with him.
</P>
<P>
   After a hearing on Friday, Judge Mary Cooper of U.S. District
Court in Trenton indicated that she would rule this week on Liborio
S. Bellomo's bid to return to his prison cell in Atlanta.

BOGGED-DOWN PEACE TALKS EXTENDED INTO MONDAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID L. MARCUS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WYE MILLS, Md. _ President Clinton and Vice President Al Gore
ratcheted up the pressure on Israelis and Palestinians at a rural
Maryland retreat Sunday, but by nightfall the White House announced
that peace talks will have to be extended through Monday.
</P>
<P>
   In what was supposed to be the final day of a summit,
discussions bogged down over over a variety of security issues,
including whether Palestinians accused of terrorism will be
extradicted to Israel for trial.
</P>
<P>
   No agreements had been reached by nightfall, but the White House
hoped to avoid an embarrassing setback by forging an accord before
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat fly back to the Mideast.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, who has already devoted the bulk of three days to the
summit, raised the stakes considerably by adding another day of
discussions.
</P>
<P>
   A blackout of details by the White House effectively kept the
most important parts of the negotiations secret. But officials
confirmed that Netanyahu and Arafat had not had a face-to-face
meeting or a phone conversation since Friday _ a sign that talks
were stagnating.
</P>
<P>
   On an afternoon when US aides asked to be informed periodically
of football scores, State Department spokesman James P. Rubin said
the discussions had entered the ``endgame.''
</P>
<P>
   The surreal day at the 1,000-acre conference center included
accounts of Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat taking a bicycle ride
in full military regalia.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Clinton shuttled on foot between his two guests
and took a solitary 20-minute stroll by the Wye River.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe it's in the best interest of the peace process to
continue the discussions,'' White House spokesman Joe Lockhart
said.
</P>
<P>
   He added that Clinton has not decided whether he will visit
Monday. ``The work is continuing at a good pace,'' Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
   The White House had announced last week that Clinton would be on
call over the weekend and had not mentioned the possibility of
Gore's involvement in the talks. Clinton's helicopter landed at the
retreat at 11:30 a.m., shortly after Gore arrived. Clinton and Gore
climbed into the back of a Chevy Suburban with National Security
Adviser Sandy Berger. All wore casual clothes.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and Gore met with Israel Defense Minister Yitzhak
Mordechai and the new, hard-line foreign minister Ariel Sharon for
25 minutes, then met for lunch with Netanyahu and his top aides for
an hour and 40 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   After an hour meeting with Arafat, Clinton had dinner with his
staff, then met separately with Arafat and Netanyahu again.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright planned to stay over
last night at the Wye center, where Netanyahu and Arafat are
encamped just one-third of a mile apart from each other.
</P>
<P>
   The meetings might even be extended again. One of the
indications was a rumor that the caterers had been told to stay
until Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The main subject of the talks _ an Israeli withdrawal from 13
percent more of the West Bank _ appears relatively simple, but it
goes to the heart of emotional issues for both sides. For
Palestinians, the point is getting land, and eventually an
independent state. For Israelis, the issue is security _ keeping
Palestinians to their promises to crack down on terrorists.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli officials have made clear that they will make
concessions to Arafat only after getting solid agreements that
Palestinians will cooperate with American and Israeli officials in
pursuing terrorists.
</P>
<P>
   These difficult talks are a prelude to ``permanent status''
negotiations over water rights, the boundaries of Jerusalem, and
other thorny issues.
</P>
<P>
   CIA director George Tenet and top US intelligence officials were
said to be at the compound over the weekend, along with Clinton's
Mideast negotiating team.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if the president succeeds out at Wye, it doesn't mean the
Mideast policy is a success,'' said Richard Haass, director of
foreign policy studies at the Brookings Institution, a Washington
think tank. ``The big issues still remain.''
</P>
<P>
   The State Department continued to dampen expectations of a major
agreement. ``Wye is not Camp David,'' Rubin said in an allusion to
former President Jimmy Carter's breakthrough after 13 intensive
days of talks between Israelis and Egyptians.
</P>
<P>
   These talks, coming just 2 1/2 weeks before US congressional
elections, are giving Clinton a chance to showcase his diplomatic
skills. But he faces great obstacles, including an Israeli prime
minister and foreign minister who pride themselves on being tough
on terrorists.
</P>
<P>
   The talks also come amid conflicting reports about the health of
Jordan's King Hussein, who is being treated for cancer at the Mayo
Clinic in Minnesota. Hussein, who consults often with US officials,
has been a strong force in pushing Israelis and Palestinians to
meet.
</P>
<P>
   The State Department fanned the speculation about Hussein's
condition by issuing a statement that seemed to imply that his
death would not set back the peace process. The statement also
noted that Albright had called Hussein as well as his brother,
Crown Prince Hassan.
</P>
<P>
   ``King Hussein has been very open about his battle with
cancer,'' the statement said. ``The United States commitment to
Jordan is iron-clad, based on our deep, long-standing, shared
interest in regional peace and stability.''

SINN FEIN LEADER `DELIGHTED' OVER IRISH HONOR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVEN WILMSEN  
 AND CAROLINE COLE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ In one of his first public engagements since being
passed over for the Nobel Peace Prize, Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams
said he is at least ``delighted the prize went to Ireland.''
</P>
<P>
   ``So many people have asked me if I'm disappointed that I'm
beginning to wonder if I ought to be,'' he said Sunday at a
breakfast gathering in downtown Boston.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the peace process isn't about any of the players,'' he
said. ``It's about our children. It's about new beginnings.''
</P>
<P>
   He praised two winners of the prize, who were announced Friday.
They were David Trimble, the one-time Protestant hard-liner who
refused to shake Adams's hand in public, and John Hume, the
Catholic leader of the Social Democratic and Labor Party who long
preached nonviolence and coaxed Adams into mainstream politics.
</P>
<P>
   Many had thought that if a Northern Ireland prize were shared,
it would be three ways, including Adams. Adams has come to reject
the use of force to achieve the Catholic nationalists' goal of a
united Ireland. But the Nobel committee evidently considered
Adams's history to be too contentious. Adams said not sharing the
prize is inconsequential to the larger goal of a ``just and lasting
peace'' forged with politics, not guns.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to live in friendship and harmony with our unionist,
with our Protestant neighbors, one not better than the other,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   On the last day of a weeklong US speaking tour that also took
him to New York and Pennsylvania, Adams said he is trying to
reawaken American interest in completing the Good Friday political
settlement.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement, signed April 10, opened the possibility of
lasting stability in a province ravaged by sectarian violence for
30 years, he said at a second engagement in Lawrence. But it is
merely a beginning.
</P>
<P>
   ``The worst thing Irish Americans here could conclude is that
the struggle is over,'' he said. ``The awfulness of what happened
over the summer is a reminder to all that the difficulties
continue.''
</P>
<P>
   In August, 29 people were killed and 370 injured in a bombing in
Omagh for which Catholic extremists in a breakaway IRA faction
claimed responsibility. It was the deadliest terrorist attack in
Irish history. In July, three Catholic boys were killed in a
firebombing attributed to Protestant extremists in Ballymoney.
</P>
<P>
   Americans remain a crucial force in the ongoing process of
hammering out a new government, much of which must be completed by
Oct. 31 under the political settlement, and in establishing stable,
uncorrupt institutions such as a police force, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have been able to change US policy in the White House,''
he said, noting the importance individual Irish-Americans played in
lobbying to reverse government opposition to visas for Sinn Fein
members.
</P>
<P>
   Adams said his visa has allowed him to present the Sinn Fein
agenda to Americans in his own words.

JUSTICE DEPARTMENT SET TO TAKE ON COMPUTER GIANT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By AARON ZITNER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Computers have gotten less expensive and easier to
use. Software to browse the Internet is free. America is a
high-tech haven, with new products and new jobs created every day.
</P>
<P>
   And yet the Department of Justice is scheduled on Monday to
start presenting evidence in federal court that consumers would
have it even better were it not for illegal business practices of
the world's wealthiest man, Bill Gates, and his admired, feared,
and fabulously successful software company, Microsoft Corp.
</P>
<P>
   It is billed as the biggest antitrust case since the government
broke up AT&AMP;T Corp. in 1984, and some analysts say it could reshape
the economy as profoundly as the 1911 breakup of John D.
Rockefeller's Standard Oil Co. If the government wins a broad
victory, US v. Microsoft Corp. could do more than pare back the
Redmond, Wash., company's presence on the world's desktops. It
could limit the muscle that Microsoft is using to push its way into
the lucrative markets of the future: on-line banking, Internet
commerce, interactive television.
</P>
<P>
   The case will turn on technical questions about software
development, as well as interpretations of Microsoft memos and
business meetings in which, the government says, the company abused
its monopoly power when dealing with business partners and
competitors.
</P>
<P>
   But underlying the evidence will be a basic question of
philosophy: Given that the US software industry constantly makes
better products for less money, how much should the government
interfere?
</P>
<P>
   ``Supposing Microsoft does have market power, do you want to
give it a lot of freedom or have more government intervention?''
asked Eleanor Fox, an antitrust specialist at the New York
University School of Law. ``There is an argument that the best way
to advance technology is to leave highly progressive, inventive
companies alone.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't want attorneys and legislators trying to set
technical standards,'' said Donald DePalma, principal analyst at
Forrester Research Inc. in Cambridge.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, trimming back Microsoft's power might allow
other companies to thrive and compete in parts of the technology
world that it now dominates. ``I believe Microsoft is too powerful
and should be broken up into separate businesses,'' said John
Cullinane, the Boston software marketing pioneer whose Cullinet
Software Inc. became the first software firm listed on the New York
Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's power comes from the popularity of its Windows
product, a type of software called an operating system. Operating
systems control the basic functions of computers, such as storing
data, retrieving files, and helping the computer run spreadsheets,
games, word processors, or other ``applications'' programs.
</P>
<P>
   Windows powers about 90 percent of all personal computers, and
nearly every company that makes PCs wants the right to sell
Windows. Nearly every company that develops games, spreadsheets, or
other applications wants access to the latest version of Windows,
before it hits the market, so it can get an early jump on designing
its products. For all of these companies, good relations with
Microsoft, which also has a significant presence in applications
software, are essential _ and often delicate.
</P>
<P>
   ``He who controls the operating system controls the world of
computing,'' said Cullinane.
</P>
<P>
   The government says Microsoft took advantage of this power to
bully other companies into helping it gain a leading position in
other businesses, such as the market for Internet browser software
used to view material on the World Wide Web. It is not illegal to
run a monopoly. It is illegal for a company to use its monopoly to
push its way into new businesses.
</P>
<P>
   One charge likely to arise is that Microsoft tried to coerce
Compaq Computer Corp. into abandoning a plan to load its computers
with a browser made by Netscape Communications Corp., the chief
competitor to Microsoft's own browser. Microsoft's alleged leverage
was a threat to withdraw Compaq's license to sell Windows with its
computers, which if carried out would have made Compaq PCs
unattractive to consumers.
</P>
<P>
   The trial may also raise claims that Microsoft illegally tried
to divide the browser market with Netscape, to induce Intel Corp.
to abandon a software project, and to persuade Apple Computer Co.
to change a business plan. Microsoft is vigorously contesting all
charges and says the government has taken internal memos and
descriptions of meetings out of context.
</P>
<P>
   The government faces significant hurdles in making its case. To
begin with, it must show that Windows gives Microsoft a monopoly
hold on the market for operating systems.
</P>
<P>
   That might seem easy. But Microsoft will argue that its 90
percent market share does not necessarily give it monopoly powers.
Consumers can choose computers powered by Apple's operating system,
or Unix and OS/2, among others. That they choose not to does not in
itself make Microsoft a monopolist, the company will say.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, economists hired by Microsoft argue that to have true
monopoly power, a company must be able to raise prices without fear
of backlash from consumers. A monopolist also has the luxury of
refusing to make the investment needed to improve its product. In a
true monopoly, consumers would not have the option of going
elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   But at about $50 per copy of Windows, Microsoft charges less
than 5 percent of what a firm with monopoly power would charge,
claim Bernard Reddy, Davis Evans, and Albert Nichols of National
Economic Research Associates Inc. in Cambridge. Moreover, they said
in a recent paper, Microsoft is under relentless pressure to
improve Windows.
</P>
<P>
   The reason, they said, is that Microsoft faces the threat of
competition, from giants like IBM Corp. and from unknown newcomers.
Fifteen-year-old boys have developed winning software using little
more than a single computer, and their products can be distributed
easily over the Internet. ``There are no high barriers to entry in
the PC software market,'' said David Mills, a University of
Virginia economist working on a Microsoft contract. ``You need only
smart people and venture capital.''
</P>
<P>
   If the government is able to prove that Microsoft is indeed a
monopoly, it faces the additional burden of showing that Microsoft
used its monopoly power illegally in inducing Apple, Intel,
Netscape, or others to take actions that benefited Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   The government also faces a test in the court of public opinion.
Now 24 years old, Microsoft is among only a handful of companies to
have dominated a key industry so completely, and so quickly. For a
short while this year, it passed General Electric Co. to claim the
highest stock market value of any company in America, though
Microsoft has one-sixth the sales of GE and one-10th the employees.
</P>
<P>
   Americans seem to like this kind of success. One recent survey,
by US News &AMP; World Report, found that 80 percent of Americans have
a favorable impression of Microsoft and 73 percent have a favorable
impression of Bill Gates. The survey also found that more people
think the government's antitrust suit is a bad idea than a good
idea.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the government faces a decidedly mixed history of
successful outcomes in technology antitrust cases. A suit 30 years
ago against IBM dragged on for nearly 13 years, including six years
of trial, before the government dropped it. It entailed 2,500
depositions, 66 million pages of evidence, and 974 trial witnesses,
according to the trade paper Computerworld.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson has already set rules to make sure
the Microsoft case is no repeat of the IBM suit. Each side is
limited to 12 witnesses and several rebuttal witnesses, and all
direct testimony has been submitted in writing in advance of the
trial. In the courtroom, the lawyers will only cross-examine
witnesses. It could all be wrapped up within two months.
</P>
<P>
   Top officials from Microsoft, Netscape, Apple, Intel, America
Online Inc., and other leading high-tech firms are scheduled to
testify. Gates is not expected to appear, though his videotaped
deposition may be played.
</P>
<P>
   The government has not laid out all of the remedies it will seek
if it wins the case. It might try to force Microsoft to refashion
Windows so that it includes the browser made by its rival,
Netscape. On the more extreme end, it might try to break
Microsoft's operating system division into a separate company, the
way AT&AMP;T in 1984 split into a long-distance company and seven
regional Baby Bells. But a breakup effort is considered unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   Cullinane suggested another idea: ``From a practical viewpoint,
(Microsoft's) operating systems should be in the public domain,
thus making it possible for other companies to compete to make the
best Windows product,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Even if Microsoft wins, it may ultimately have a lot to lose.
The government case could make it easier for private firms to bring
their own antitrust actions. And Senator John F. Kerry has already
urged his colleagues to follow the suit with an eye toward passing
tougher antitrust laws.
</P>
<P>
   The trial ``may force Congress to examine whether existing
antitrust law sufficiently addresses market abuses in the new
digital age,'' Kerry said in a written statement last week. The
case may ``force Congress to consider new and important consumer
protection and market dominance issues.''
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft said Friday that there are no active settlement talks
under way, suggesting oral arguments will in fact begin  &UR; today &LR; , in
the same federal court building that housed the Monica Lewinsky
grand jury and where government antitrust lawyers recently blocked
a Massachusetts company, Staples Inc., from merging with Office
Depot Inc. of Delray Beach, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is just Chapter 1 of this case,'' said Brad Smith,
Microsoft's second-ranking lawyer. ``It's too early to know, but
it's certainly possible that we'll see this case go to the Court of
Appeals and possibly the Supreme Court. We're probably looking at a
case that has one year, or two or three years, to run before it
ends.''

CAREFULLY OPTIMISTIC, U.S. ANNOUNCES EXTENSION OF MIDEAST PEACE
TALKS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs grafs 8 &AMP; 11 to add comments from Israeli official; Changes
time of Arafat-Clinton meeting to 9 PM from 8 PM in 14th graf;

<P>
   WYE MILLS, Md. _ Despite more than 20 hours of personal
engagement by President Clinton, talks with Israeli and Palestinian
leaders on an interim peace accord will continue past their
original deadline and into Monday, U.S. officials announced Sunday
evening.
</P>
<P>
   ``The work is continuing at a good pace,'' said State Department
Spokesman James Rubin. ``There is a serious effort being made, and
the meetings today and our overall mood and the atmosphere
justifies almost certainly continuing these meetings tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's spokesman, Joe Lockhart, said: ``We believe it's in
the best interests of the peace process to continue the
discussions.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials did not try to put a gloss on the extension,
citing the detailed nature of the problems to be worked out and the
continuing lack of trust among the parties. One senior
administration official said extension was not failure, and success
was still possible.
</P>
<P>
   It was not immediately clear whether Clinton would return on
Monday to the Wye Conference Center near here, where Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat
have been since Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   But with three days of direct negotiations by Clinton, who was
joined on Sunday by Vice President Al Gore, and with a full-time
mediation effort by Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and the
director of central intelligence, George Tenet, a failure to reach
agreement here would be a devastating blow to Clinton's prestige
and to the search for a Middle East peace.
</P>
<P>
   But some officials suggested that the U.S. urgency is not fully
shared by the Israeli or Palestinian leaders, who will have to make
difficult choices that will almost certainly alienate important
parts of their constituencies. As of Sunday evening, U.S. officials
confirmed, Netanyahu and Arafat have not met together since Friday.
</P>
<P>
   An Israeli official said Sunday night, ``We can't predict the
results. As long as progress is being made we are prepared to stay.
The big issue for us _ security _ is far from being resolved. It's
quite disappointing.''
</P>
<P>
   What is at stake, after a 19-month delay, is an interim accord
under which the Israelis will withdraw from another 13 percent of
the West Bank in stages over 12 weeks, in return for phased and
verifiable Palestinian steps to fight terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   ``The parties are into real bargaining at last,'' one official
said, ``and we want to keep them talking.'' But the official said
that while significant progress had been made on different issues,
including security, there was no complete agreement on any of the
major issues.
</P>
<P>
   An Israeli official said specifically that the third Israeli
withdrawal and a commitment from the Palestinians to publicly
change their charter, which calls for Israel's destruction, were
still not solved.
</P>
<P>
   The Americans made a big push to get an agreement. Clinton, who
had stayed for a dinner Saturday night with Arafat and the
Palestinians, helped organize a long night of meetings supervised
by Ms. Albright, who has remained at the Wye Center since Thursday.
Clinton, together with Gore, returned Sunday morning for another
long day of chats, walks, meals and pressure.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton first met with his team, then with the Israelis,
including a long lunch with Netanyahu. Arafat, in his traditional
regalia, was said to have taken a bicycle ride for more than an
hour, while bodyguards, both U.S. and Palestinian, jogged
alongside.
</P>
<P>
   At about 6 p.m., Clinton met for an hour with Arafat, then took
a break for dinner with his staff. He was scheduled to meet again
with Arafat at about 9 p.m. and then to have another conversation
with Netanyahu after that.
</P>
<P>
   ``The talks continue and the president will remain engaged
throughout the evening,'' Lockhart said. But he said he did not not
expect the three leaders to meet together at any time during the
night.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether after so much direct involvement by so many senior
members of the Clinton administration it was possible to allow
Netanyahu and Arafat to leave here without an agreement, Rubin
simply said: ``That's a very well-formulated question.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials had said that their decision to bring the leaders
here was a risk so soon before the mid-term elections on Nov. 3,
but that no president was likely to be punished by U.S. voters for
making an effort to advance the cause of peace in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   One official said, however, that much of what remains to be
decided is in the hands of Netanyahu and it was ``potentially
risky,'' at least, if an agreement required public pressure on
Israel, which could alienate some U.S. voters.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday evening, Rubin would not discuss the stakes for the
administration, except to say that the Americans ``do feel a sense
of urgency.'' Entering these meetings, ``we felt very strongly that
in the absence of making these kinds of agreements and putting the
peace process back on track there were serious dangers ahead for
the peoples of the Middle East,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe in a sense of urgency and we are trying to instill
that into the parties,'' Rubin added. ``But I would not want to
characterize how urgent they feel the situation is.''
</P>
<P>
   The Americans are particularly conscious that the Oslo accords
expire on May 4. By that date, Palestinians and Israelis are
supposed to have completed a final peace settlement that sets
Palestine's borders, its status, the fate of refugees and the
future of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat has threatened to declare Palestinian statehood
unilaterally on May 5, but the Americans and even the opposition
Labor Party in Israel, which negotiated the Oslo accords, have
warned him not to take such unilateral actions. At the same time,
U.S. officials say that a May 4 deadline cannot be ignored, and
that tensions in the region could explode if Arafat and the
Israelis are not well on their way toward an agreement.
</P>
<P>
   But this interim deal must be settled first. If that can be
accomplished, the final status talks will formally re-open under
Clinton's aegis, with the aim of trying to complete at least the
framework for a peace treaty before next May.
</P>
<P>
   Rubin appealed to the two sides to find ``the political will''
to agree to this relatively minor accord. ``There is time to
complete the work if the political will is there to make the tough
decisions,'' he said. Rubin denied that the Americans have any
interest in a partial agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Difficult issues remain, officials said, including a method by
which Palestinian efforts to combat terrorism will be judged and an
Israeli demand for the extradition of Palestinians wanted in
Israel.
</P>
<P>
   There has been talk that the CIA, which sits with both sides on
a security committee, could vet the cases against wanted
Palestinians and decide whether they should be tried. When Israel
asks for extradition now, , the Palestinians answer that the person
is wanted for charges by the Palestinian authorities, so may not be
handed over.
</P>
<P>
   The Palestinians also want guarantees of prisoner releases by
the Israelis, and want firm guarantees that a third interim
withdrawal by the Israelis from the West Bank, called for under the
Oslo and Hebron accords, will take place. At the moment, there is a
general agreement that the issue will be handled by the borders
committee set up under the final status talks.
</P>
<P>
   But Rubin said that Washington clearly did not want a third
interim redeployment to create the same kinds of problems that all
sides face here, with their efforts to finish the first two
redeployments.
</P>
<P>
   Rubin and the Americans were also eager to knock down an Israeli
newspaper report that Jordan's King Hussein, under treatment for
lymphoma at the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota, is dying.
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper, Yediot Ahronot, said in its Sunday editions that
U.S. officials had told Netanyahu's aides that the king's condition
is terminal and ``it is doubtful he will ever return to actively
functioning as king in full capacity.''
</P>
<P>
   It said that the Americans and Israelis had discussed a
transition of power to the king's brother, Crown Prince Hassan, and
fears that there could be instability in Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   The statement described the king as ``making good progress'' and
said, ``We look forward to his full recovery.'' But it added: ``We
have great confidence in Crown Prince Hassan, who has been and
remains a very able partner for King Hussein, as well as for the
United States.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Both the king and crown prince have continued to play very
active and helpful roles in support of the peace process and the
Wye peace talks,'' the statement said.
</P>
<P>
   Rubin said later that the report was entirely untrue, and that
both Clinton and Ms. Albright had spoken by telephone with the king
in recent days.
</P>
<P>
   Ariel Sharon, the new Israeli foreign minister, also issued a
statement denying that he had said that the king, whom he visited
before coming here, is dying. But photographs of the meeting showed
Hussein looking very ill after another round of chemotherapy, and
U.S. officials have also been careful to be in touch with the crown
prince, including a telephone call to him Sunday morning from Ms.
Albright.
</P>
<P>
   Hussein, who has ruled Jordan for 45 years, suffers from
non-Hodgkins lymphoma, a type of cancer that primarily afflicts the
lymph nodes and spleen. He has been receiving treatment at the Mayo
Clinic since mid-July.

TWO PASSERS HAVE ROLLER-COASTER WEEK
</HEADLINE>
   (jw) 
 BY WILLIAM C. RHODEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ Danny Kanell was elated Sunday. The
Giants had just won over Arizona, and he had enjoyed the best day
of his career: completing 22 of 36 passes for 259 yards and three
touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   On his way to the interview room, he passed Coach Jim Fassel.
``Good job,'' Fassel said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thanks, that was fun,'' Kanell responded. ``That talk last
night really helped.''
</P>
<P>
   Fassel had told his players to lighten up; the sky wasn't
falling, the world wasn't ending. They'd simply lost two games. Now
it was time to win one. Thanks in large part to Kanell, they did,
34-7.
</P>
<P>
   Rewind two weeks for a different picture of Kanell. He was
disheartened as he stood before the news media, talking about a
performance against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers that he acknowledged
had been the worst in his two years as starter: 10 for 27 passing
with three interceptions and 83 yards.
</P>
<P>
   He had apologized to his teammates, telling them he would never
let it happen again. And while he wasn't as bad the next week, the
Giants still lost to Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Fassel said Sunday that he had been concerned. ``After the last
two weeks I was,'' the coach said. ``But he wasn't getting help;
the guy was getting killed back in the pocket. I really never lost
confidence in him. He got a little lazy with his mechanics. I felt
good about Danny's preparation, I felt good about seeing him under
pressure. I just needed to keep his confidence going so it doesn't
wane _ protecting him a little bit so he doesn't take too many
bullets, and then let him do his job.''
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's high for Kanell was another day in the life of a
maturing pro quarterback, a roller-coaster ride with sharp highs,
steep lows and dramatic shifts in performances. And this season,
the National Football League seems to have an inordinate number of
young quarterbacks trying to find their way.
</P>
<P>
   Glenn Foley, the Jets' hero last month, was benched again in the
wake of a terrible performance in St. Louis last week. Peyton
Manning, Indianapolis' high-priced, high-octane rookie, had led the
league in interceptions before matching Steve Young on Sunday in a
close loss to San Francisco. With Danny Wuerffel at quarterback,
New Orleans is so desperate that the Saints snatched Kerry Collins
off the waiver wire after he had quit on Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   ``Guys were asking me for advice on how to tell Ryan Leaf to get
out of his slump,'' Kanell said, referring to San Diego's
high-priced rookie passer. ``That's the way it is.''
</P>
<P>
   There's a thin line to walk between waiting for a quarterback to
blossom and pulling the plug. Last season, Fassel pulled the plug
on Dave Brown and went with Kanell.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think probably three years,'' Fassel said. ``Last year was a
kind of experimental year, this year settling in, next year is
taking it from there.''
</P>
<P>
   As Kanell spoke about his triumphant afternoon, Jake Plummer,
the Cardinals' second-year quarterback, stood before reporters
downcast as if the world had caved in. His world was intact, but
his passing pocket had been in shambles. Plummer was 12 for 21
passing for 139 yards, with one touchdown and two interceptions.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's frustrating,'' Plummer said. ``Any time you try to do
your job and you're not doing it well, it's frustrating. But my
confidence is never going to go down the tank. It's not my style,
it's not what I'm made of. I have to stand, be strong and show my
teammates that I'm young but I'm going to come back this week and
work hard. Maybe I need to put in a little extra work.''
</P>
<P>
   Someone asked Plummer, who turned 23 in December, if he thinks
improvement is a matter of working harder or simply playing longer,
gaining experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want let time be my excuse,'' Plummer said. ``I really
don't have time. In two weeks, we play Detroit; if I'm looking for
extra time, there's no way I'm going to get it. I want to be a good
quarterback and lead this team right now. If it takes time,
hopefully they'll stick with me and let me develop.''
</P>
<P>
   Plummer said he drew some measure of encouragement from Kanell,
who had quieted his critics _ for the time being. ``He's probably
had it harder than I have,'' Plummer said, ``being out here in New
York, with everyone down his throat and yelling at him. But he's
tough.''
</P>
<P>
   Across the hall, Kanell was sympathetic to Plummer.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the way it is in this game,'' Kanell said. ``Everybody
goes through it. It's like a cycle. The guys who are going to
survive are the guys who can make it through the times like this.''
</P>
<P>
   Kanell finally excused himself and went off to savor the
victory. He should enjoy it while he can.

ADOLF ALTHOFF, 85, WHO HID CIRCUS PEOPLE FROM NAZIS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By ERIC PACE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Adolf Althoff, a courageous German circus executive who saved
several people in the Nazi era by having them work and travel with
his circus, died in his sleep on Wednesday in a hospital in
Stolberg near Aachen, Germany. He was 85 and lived in Stolberg.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was probably heart failure, said the German news
agency DPA. He had been hospitalized after a fall at home.
</P>
<P>
   A member of a 300-year-old circus family, Althoff figures in a
book about Germans who saved Jews from the Holocaust, ``Other
Germans Under Hitler'' by Herbert Straeten, published last year in
Germany. In the book Althoff is quoted as saying, ``Circus people
don't ask if you are Christian, Jewish or heathen.''
</P>
<P>
   When the book was published, Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel of
Germany said: ``It is incredible how many simple people _ farmers,
people in the circus _ tried to help. But it was a minority who had
the courage to resist. Most Germans did not.''
</P>
<P>
   When the Gestapo came to check the circus, Althoff used the
phrase ``Go fishing'' to warn people who were traveling with him.
He once said in an interview, ``In a circus you can do a lot and
keep it secret.''
</P>
<P>
   His bravery earned him a high honor in 1995 from the Yad Vashem
Holocaust memorial in Israel. It also won him an award in 1994 from
a German organization, the Stuttgart Circus-Friends, which called
him a descendant of one of the oldest and greatest circus families
in Germany.
</P>
<P>
   He was born in Sonsbeck near Duesseldorf, while his parents'
circus was on tour. At 17 he became publicity director of the
circus.
</P>
<P>
   Althoff and his sister formed their own circus while he was in
his 20s, and he was its ringmaster for 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   He was also, as one circus colleague put it after his death, ``a
fantastic animal trainer and animal psychologist.'' He even managed
to ride tigers. ``His operation was regarded as a model circus
because of its discipline and the beauty of its numbers,'' DPA
said. His career took him around Europe and to North Africa and the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   In 1940, Althoff began five years' of concealing the four
members of the Bento performing family in his circus. By some
accounts the husband, Peter Bento, and his wife, Irene, were
Jewish. Peter worked as a clown and Irene as a trick rider. Other
accounts suggest that the husband was not Jewish. Their two
children were reported to be still performing in Germany 40 years
after the war, much in demand as clowns.
</P>
<P>
   Althoff is said to have provided the Bentos with false identity
papers and let them perform under pseudonyms. The German newspaper
Die Welt said on Friday: ``In every city Gestapo officials came to
check the circus. Because Althoff had friends in almost every city,
he was mostly informed a bit ahead of time about the `visit.' Then
he knocked on the widow of the Bentos' large covered wagon and gave
the cue for them to disappear: `Go fishing.'''
</P>
<P>
   Years later heart trouble and diabetes forced Althoff to cut
back his activities. In 1965 he sold the Frederike Hagenbeck circus
and founded a ``safari park'' near Aachen.
</P>
<P>
   When his son, Franz, founded the Williams Althoff circus in
1977, Adolf Althoff went on tour with it. When he was 70, a tiger
performing with him bit his hand. He had the wound bandaged quickly
and kept performing.
</P>
<P>
   Surviving are his wife, Maria, and his son.

POLLS SHOW AMERICA IS THE LAND OF THE GREAT DIVIDE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICK MONTGOMERY  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ An uncommonly quiet week on the front lines
of the White House sex scandal left the media with little to report
but another round of polling. And the latest batch of numbers shows
what the last batch showed and the batch before that.
</P>
<P>
   Americans aren't budging. By some measures they haven't budged
in nine months.
</P>
<P>
   Roughly seven of 10 Republicans want President Clinton out of
office, the sooner the better, and seven of 10 Democrats won't
stand for it _ period, end of story. ``Independent'' voters say
they're fed up with the bickering, really fed up, but that's not
stopping Congress from grinding through the impeachment process.
</P>
<P>
   This is America, land of the Great Divide.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't think of a time when politics has been this
polarized,'' said Mike Lux, a lobbyist for People for the American
Way. The liberal organization has just released a TV commercial
urging Congress to ``Move On'' past Clinton's alleged obstruction
of justice in the Monica Lewinsky matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``It keeps building and building,'' Lux said of the chasm.
``It's unbelievable. Each side is as vehement as the other. The
whole thing makes you worry about the state of our democracy,
whether we can ever get together.''
</P>
<P>
   The cleaving of the public conscience can be painful, said Pete
Hutchison of the Kansas City-based Landmark Legal Foundation, which
has fought Clinton in court.
</P>
<P>
   ``No pain, no gain,'' he said, however. ``I think we come out of
these defining moments strengthened.''
</P>
<P>
   How divisive is this issue? Consumer activist Ralph Nader argues
that it can be settled only by a nationwide referendum for the
purpose of guiding Congress: Should Clinton stay or go?
</P>
<P>
   How inflammatory is this issue? More than 3,000 people at a
Christian Coalition convention last month sprung to their feet and
cheered lustily at coalition founder Pat Robertson's suggestion
that Clinton go directly to jail.
</P>
<P>
   How prickly is this issue? Many candidates for Congress are
trying their best to avoid it.
</P>
<P>
   At a luncheon Thursday in Kansas City, U.S. Sen. Kit Bond of
Missouri did not mention Clinton's problems, not even in jest,
during a 20-minute address before a friendly crowd. The Republican
took a halfhearted swing at the impeachment question only after an
audience member raised it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where that goes, nobody knows,'' said Bond, who could be among
the 100 senators deciding the president's fate if Clinton is
impeached. ``That could be a long, long process.''
</P>
<P>
   Since news broke in January of Clinton's relationship with
Lewinsky, public opinion has remained fairly fixed.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have dug themselves in,'' said John Kohut, senior
editor of the ``Rothenberg Political Report,'' a Washington
newsletter.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's the 30 percent of people who always hated Clinton.
There's the 30 percent who always liked him and the remaining 40
percent who want this scandal to be over with,'' Kohut said. ``And
then you have this parallel universe in Congress, where the
ignition of impreachment has been started.
</P>
<P>
   ``This car's going to move. It's supposed to move, because this
is the constitutional process for judging impeachable offenses.
Nobody can stop this car.''
</P>
<P>
   If the ride is rough, the president's adversaries say, the
nation must hold on tight and adhere to the rule that no person _
not even the president _ is above the law.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here's the question that makes everything so heated,'' said
Hutchison. ``Where should our moral compass take us? That segment
of the baby-boom generation that Clinton embodies, morally _ is
that what we want to be as a nation?''
</P>
<P>
   Yet it's that wielding of some moral yardstick that makes so
many in the country seethe.
</P>
<P>
   ``Democrats, including myself, aren't happy with Bill Clinton,''
said lobbyist Lux, ``but we feel intensely the Republicans are
creating a constitutional crisis based on things that many great
presidents have done.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps this crisis must be played out, said Ellen Fitzpatrick,
associate professor of history at the University of New Hampshire.
For every issue that has driven a wedge through Washington _ from
slavery to McCarthyism to Watergate _ history has used the conflict
to define important changes in culture.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd not be having this debate if the public wasn't fascinated
by this story,'' Fitzpatrick said. ``A kind of synergy has brought
us to this point. This conflict serves the needs of the political
parties, it serves the needs and interests of the mass media and,
in some ways, it serves the needs and interests of a divided
public.
</P>
<P>
   ``The argument that this will do irreparable damage to our
nation is nonsense.''
</P>
<P>
   If the bulk of America continues to argue that Clinton should
stay in office, Fitzpatrick predicted, ``this train ultimately will
lose its steam.''
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to the public's loyal _ stubborn? _ support for
Clinton, President Nixon's approval ratings steadily eroded as the
Watergate investigation and congressional hearings moved ahead.
</P>
<P>
   In June 1973, for example, a Gallup Poll found 44 percent of
Americans approving of Nixon's job performance. That fell to 31
percent by the end of the year and to 24 percent in the weeks
before Nixon resigned in the summer of 1974.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's job approval ratings so far have shown no such
slippage.
</P>
<P>
   ``In fact, these have been the best nine months of his
presidency,'' said poll-tracker Karlyn Bowman of the American
Enterprise Institute. ``Never has his rating been this high for
this long.''
</P>
<P>
   Below the surface, however, Americans appear to be increasingly
troubled by the character of their leader. MORE

FEARS HAVE OUTRUN THE FACTS OF E-COMMERCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY HEASTER  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED: Numbers sometimes aren't what they seem, especially
when they're presented in the absence of any meaningful context.
</P>
<P>
   An example of this occurred in a recent Page One story in The
Kansas City Star exploring the relative merits of sales taxes
compared with property taxes as sources of money for local
governments. The point of the story was that excessive reliance on
sales taxes might prove chancy if the economy goes into recession.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the story noted, the problem could be exacerbated if
Internet shopping continues to grow because Internet transactions
escape sales taxes. This point was buttressed by an estimate that
Internet shopping this year would total $6 billion and rise to $40
billion in a few years.
</P>
<P>
   Some readers no doubt considered these numbers a big deal, and
thus logically assigned the Internet a lot more significance than
it deserves as a domestic and global commercial hub. In the
process, the myth of the Internet's growing commercial effect got
another coat of luster it didn't deserve.
</P>
<P>
   Granted, any number with a billion behind it involves a huge
amount of money. Even so, in the context of total personal
consumption, $6 billion in sales is statistically irrelevant in the
U.S. economy. By extension, the Internet as a sales hub is also
irrelevant for purposes of trying to make a point about the
economy.
</P>
<P>
   Look at it this way: The personal consumption component of the
gross domestic product reached an annual rate of $5.13 trillion in
this year's second quarter. This is an inflation-adjusted number
measured in 1992 dollars. At this rate, even without adjusting for
inflation, $6 billion will represent only a smidgen more than
one-tenth of 1 percent of all U.S. consumer activity in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   In the unlikely event the economy fails to expand during the
next few years, the Internet's share of the personal consumption
GDP component still will remain well under 1 percent even if
on-line shopping expands as fast as anticipated.
</P>
<P>
   A recent story in The Wall Street Journal, in fact,
characterized the Internet as an ``economic pipsqueak.'' It noted
an estimate by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and
Development that put worldwide electronic commerce last year at $26
billion and expected it to reach $1 trillion by 2005. The story
cautioned, though, that such numbers also need to be put in
context, because $26 billion was only 0.5 percent of total retail
sales for the organization's seven biggest economies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even at $1 trillion,'' the article said, ``e-commerce would
amount to less than the current annual sales that flow from direct
marketing in the United States using mail, telephone and
newspapers.''
</P>
<P>
   This prompted an economics professor at Maastricht University to
observe that ``there is no other area of technological change with
such a discrepancy between the actual phenomenon and what people,
policy-makers and businessmen believe and expect from the future.''
</P>
<P>
   While conceding that the Internet has transformed niche markets
such as book sales, many economists don't expect electronic
commerce to radically alter the way consumers buy ``the vast
majority of their goods and services.''
</P>
<P>
   The bottom line? All revenue streams are often unpredictable,
whether you're running a private or government enterprise.
Everybody knows that. Meanwhile, the Internet isn't all that big a
deal in the world of business and commerce. Not enough people know
that.

THIS FAT CAT LOSES HER DESIRE TO BE A LONER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By C.W. GUSEWELLE  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED: The calico cat, Spanky, has had a midlife personality
change _ she has become softer of nature, more affectionate.
</P>
<P>
   For so long a dour and misanthropic creature, she used to spend
her days perched on the stair landing, frowning out at the world
with an owlish glare. The other cats, and even the dogs, would
start up the stairway, spy her there, hesitate and then turn back.
</P>
<P>
   She never was seen at the food dish or the water bowl. That she
did take nourishment was obvious, for she developed first a
swinging paunch and then a noticeable spread.
</P>
<P>
   But being crabbed and secretive by temperament, she evidently
preferred to eat and drink when the house was dark and all the rest
of us were sleeping.
</P>
<P>
   In those earlier years, it was those other cats she especially
despised. Some find this distaste for one's own species baffling,
but I have to say I understand completely. There are a fair number
of human beings for whom I have no use.
</P>
<P>
   Then, sometime in Spanky's eighth year, or it may have been her
ninth, this change occurred.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't happen gradually. It came almost overnight, as if
she'd simply decided, after long observation and much
consideration, that life was sweeter for those who made the effort
to be sociable.
</P>
<P>
   So she awoke one morning a beast of an entirely different sort.
</P>
<P>
   She has been seen deliberately approaching the other cats of the
household, even touching noses with them, though the terror of
those others, the first time that happened, was very great.
</P>
<P>
   She joins them on the kitchen counter for the distribution of
bits of leftover chicken or fish.
</P>
<P>
   She has largely abandoned her station on the stair landing,
having discovered the greater comfort of the couch or the upstairs
bed, and even permits her fellow cats to join her there.
</P>
<P>
   From time to time, in past years, I found it necessary to
extract a shed claw, hers, from the muzzle of one or the other of
the pups.
</P>
<P>
   She has not yet established anything that could be described as
a friendship with them. It's more a guarded accommodation, as
between Netanyahu and Arafat. But at least now the dogs are able to
pass up and down the stairs freely and are not transfixed by dread
if she happens to come in the room.
</P>
<P>
   And what's the result of all this congeniality?
</P>
<P>
   Well, Spanky sleeps now in softer places. And, as the others
yield to her surprising overtures, she receives their
companionship. And shares the little treats that they have long
enjoyed.
</P>
<P>
   And being so much easier to live with, she naturally receives
more stroking and hears her extraordinary beauty more often
commented upon.
</P>
<P>
   The change, in other words, has paid off handsomely.
</P>
<P>
   I wait to see in myself any of this softening of a prickly
nature that the greater wisdom of age is rumored to bring but do
not detect it yet.
</P>
<P>
   They say such amazing transformations sometimes occur in violent
and predatory criminals, who are then able to put a life of
unspeakable behavior behind and go forth to hold tent revivals,
give motivational seminars, appear on daytime talk shows and
otherwise serve their fellow man.
</P>
<P>
   I have no great faith in that, either, though it's a pretty
notion.
</P>
<P>
   In Spanky, the change cannot be doubted. But cats, by and large,
are better than the rest of us.

JOB SEARCH GETS TOUGHER WITH AGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE STAFFORD  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED: The most frustrated job hunters I see are middle-aged
to older professionals with strong work histories. At career fairs
and in personal contacts, they tell the same story:
</P>
<P>
   They were laid off. They have been out of work for months. They
sometimes have good interviews, but no job offers. They believe
they are victims of age discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   They probably are. I warn, though, it might be more than age
stopping job offers. They may be asking to earn more than hirers
want to pay.
</P>
<P>
   Two other reasons come from David Opton, executive director of
Exec-U-Net, an executive career information company.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a preconceived notion that an older candidate is not
active and up to date in skills enough,'' Opton said. He added that
younger managers ``also fear that an older employee will have a
hard time working for a boss younger than themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   His organization surveyed 400 executives about their recent job
searches and found _ no surprise _ the number of interviews
declined and job searches lengthened with age.
</P>
<P>
   Compared to 35- to 40-year old executives, it took 18 percent
longer for 41- to 45-year-olds to find new positions; 24 percent
longer for 46- to 50-year-olds; 44 percent longer for 51- to
55-year-olds, and 66 percent longer for 56- to 60-year-olds.
</P>
<P>
   Out-of-work executives took an average of 9.2 months and 10.5
interviews to be re-employed. Executives who searched while
employed took an average of 11.1 months and 9.1 interviews to land
new positions.
</P>
<P>
   I tell frustrated searchers that there are no guarantees, but
there seem to be a few things that will maximize their chances for
interviews and job offers:
</P>
<P>
   - Write a skill-based, rather than chronological, resume.
Emphasize areas of expertise and experience rather than
date-by-date employment.
</P>
<P>
   - Don't broadcast salary expectations. And _ ouch _ you may even
have to lower them.
</P>
<P>
   - Use your cover letter and interview time to project
enthusiasm, adaptability and acceptance of change. Don't whine or
rage about the past. Tell what you will do in the future.

   OREGON, Mo. _ leave,'' Fisher said.
</P>
<P>
   ``What city folks don't really home in on,'' Fink said, ``is
that when we stop spending, it eventually gets back to the city.
The first thing you'll see is us buying less iron (combines and
tractors). But it also means fewer trips to the city, fertilizer,
parts, all sorts of things.
</P>
<P>
   ``The other day I needed a machinery part,'' he said. ``I went
down to my implement dealer. He said it'd be $800 and they'd have
to get it out of Kansas City. Well, I thought about it and figured
this was no time to be spending that kind of money. So I did this
and that, cobbled together a part and ended up spending about $400,
all local.
</P>
<P>
   ``That may not seem like a lot _ $800. But multiply it by
hundreds, maybe thousands. And that $800 didn't go to Kansas City.
Meaning somebody there had less work to do. So it's not as far away
as it seems.''
</P>
<P>
   Utlaut said that with the government getting out of farming with
the passage last year the Freedom to Farm law, farmers would see
wilder swings in the prices.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the old days with price supports you'd see, say, corn in a
pretty narrow range _ $2.10 to $2.50, year in a year out. Now it
may be from $1.60 to $5.''
</P>
<P>
   Farmers, Utlaut said, are going to have to have sharp pencils.
Plus bountiful harvests like this year's.

FARMERS GATHER BOUNTIFUL CROP, SEE PRICES FALL TO DISTRESSING
LEVELS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM FISHER  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   OREGON, Mo. _ An autumnal ritual is under way across the Middle
West _ fall harvest.
</P>
<P>
   Soybean fields are swept bare enough to resemble tan carpets;
sorghum plants are whole one day, decapitated the next; and huge
cornfields are turned from upright rows into khaki-colored trash in
an eye blink.
</P>
<P>
   Two facts this year:
</P>
<P>
   The Corn Belt, including most of Kansas, Missouri, Iowa and
Nebraska, has been spared the scourging drought of the Dakotas,
Texas, Oklahoma and parts of the Southeast. For this region's
farmers, there is a bumper crop.
</P>
<P>
   The second fact is that prices are in the tank, among the lowest
in a generation. Cattle, hogs, wheat, sorghum, soybeans, and that
biggest of all American crops, the 9.7 billion-bushel corn harvest,
are all in the doldrums.
</P>
<P>
   Corn prices have fallen 31.5 percent in just the past year.
According to the National Corn Growers Association in St. Louis,
this is the equivalent of a wage earner making $45,000 in 1997 but
just $30,825 in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The USDA recently estimated that lower commodity prices would
reduce this year's farm income by 16 percent, or $7 billion. Partly
because of this, and in response to the drought in various parts of
the country, Congress last week approved $6 billion in emergency
aid. The aid includes estimated payments that will ensure farmers
$2.44 a bushel for corn, well above current prices.
</P>
<P>
   Yet prices, oddly enough, are taking a back seat as the
combines, corn buggies and huge grain-hauling trucks make their way
through October.
</P>
<P>
   It's harvest. Good crops are in the field. Time to get them in.
</P>
<P>
   Which is what Byron Fink was doing northeast of Oregon, his
combine dancing a sort of agrarian ballet amid 250 acres of corn,
following the terraces and creating a landscape where vistas were
no longer hidden beyond a field's edge.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could have someone else run this combine,'' said Fink. ``But
it's harvest. And I'm a farmer.''
</P>
<P>
   The good harvest _ the 175-bushel yield per acre _ was the
result of the deep-loess soil in this part of Missouri, genetically
engineered seed, weed killers and fertilizer, and, most of all,
rains that came just at the right time all summer long.
</P>
<P>
   ``Perfect,'' Fink said of 1998's weather.
</P>
<P>
   For this crop, the price would be roughly $1.80 a bushel. Fink
is selling the crop for cash at the request of four elderly women,
and he will get a share.
</P>
<P>
   And that price was up _ given a slight bounce by recent bad
weather, a government report saying the 1998 corn crop wouldn't be
the second-biggest in history, and a hint that commodities might be
sent to Russia to help that country get through the winter.
</P>
<P>
   Even with the congressional help last week, some farmers will
barely cover their costs.
</P>
<P>
   Glen Riekoff, a corn grower near Concordia, said he needed $2.40
a bushel. And Riekoff has this perspective: Rummaging through old
family records, he found his wife's forbears had sold corn in 1889
for $1.25 a bushel, literally a king's ransom, he said, ``because
then a dollar was really a dollar.''
</P>
<P>
   As city dwellers and suburbanites have watched their stock
holdings drop, rally and then drop again in the past months,
farmers have spent more than a year witnessing a long slide in
prices, the result of high production, a strong dollar and
shriveling demand from Asian countries now mired in recession.
</P>
<P>
   Ryland Utlaut of Alma, immediate past president of the National
Corn Growers Association, predicts a ``winter of discontent'' for
the farm community.
</P>
<P>
   Fink used another phrase.
</P>
<P>
   ``I call it the full-bin syndrome,'' he said. ``Right now,
farmers are in the midst of harvest and not thinking about much
else.
</P>
<P>
   ``But get down the road a few months and those bins will still
be full and the farmer is going to have bills and expenses. Then
he'll figure up how much he's got out back, what it'll bring at
market and what he owes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then farmers are going to know what they're up against.''
</P>
<P>
   Ron Mcneall, who farms 1,250 acres near Keytesville, calls
himself an optimist.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are farmers down in west Texas and up in the Dakotas
getting zero yields or close to that. Which means we'll lose some
farmers.
</P>
<P>
   ``But here we're at least making a crop.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Mcneall is ``watching the pennies.'' His pickup has
140,000 miles on it; a meter on his tractor reads 7,000 hours. Plus
he, similar to a lot of farmers, has a side business. In Mcneall's
case, this means selling seed.
</P>
<P>
   Don Fisher, a farmer near Corder, said he had sold cash corn
this year for $1.60 to $1.62 a bushel. Two years ago he was getting
$2.75, and he can recall the top price he ever received for corn _
$5.13 a bushel in the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   ``That seems like a million years ago,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Already, Fisher said, farmers are tightening down, deferring
purchases, figuring they can make do with what they have.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think this is going to be anything like the early
1980s,'' he said, referring to a shakeout of farmers and the
media-savvy American Agricultural Movement. That group organized
``tractorcades'' to state capitols and Washington, disrupted forced
farm sales, seized grain and generally raised Cain.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of those farmers are gone,'' said Fisher. ``The
difference now is simple. Go into town on any morning and you'll
have a hard time scaring up a farmer sitting around in a coffee
shop.... They're too busy doing what they have to do to keep going.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's happened in 20 years is that farming has become a
13-month-a-year job. Sure we're going through a bad time. But if
you thought it'd last forever, you wouldn't get up in the
morning.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Fisher and Fink agree that when farmers have money the one
thing they do is put it back in the economy. ``We're like sailors
on leave,'' Fisher said. MORE

EDITORIAL: GIRLS AND COMPUTERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Monday, Oct. 19:
</P>
<P>
   A new report by the American Association of University Women
shows that a troubling gender gap in computer use exists in high
schools. Girls make up only a small percentage of students who take
high-level computer courses that might lead to technology careers.
Yet they are more likely than boys to take data-entry classes, the
high-tech equivalent of typing.
</P>
<P>
   The report also found that girls tend to use computers in
limited ways, such as for word processing, while boys are more
likely to use computers to solve problems or to develop their own
programs. In one study, girls consistently rated themselves as less
competent in computers than boys. This suggests that many girls are
starting to see the high-tech world as a masculine domain.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the gender gap is created outside the classroom.
Computer toys are more heavily marketed to boys, and most computer
games and even educational software have more male characters than
female characters. But teachers sensitive to these issues could
help turn the situation around.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, the association raised the nation's awareness of a
gender gap in enrollment in math and science courses in high
school. In less than a decade, that gap has been narrowed because
educators worked to increase girls' participation. Now educators
must insure that girls are not inadvertently left out of the
computer revolution.

   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ of their leader.
</P>
<P>
   Only 30 percent of respondents in a recent USA Today//Gallup
poll said the words ``honest'' and ``trustworthy'' applied to
Clinton. That's down from 37 percent in January. It's even a few
percentage points lower than the ``integrity'' scores given to
Nixon in the waning days of his presidency.
</P>
<P>
   At a Capitol Hill watering hole called Bullfeathers, arguments
have erupted all summer. Many have lasted until closing time, said
Stratton Liapis, owner of the hangout for congressional staffers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's party line all the way, whether people admit it or not,''
he said. ``The hard-core Republicans are the most passionate; throw
the book at Clinton, they say. The people you could label as
ultraliberal _ they're very uptight. Private matter, they say. The
people in the middle, they get off work and come in here and they
don't want to hear about it anymore. They really don't.''
</P>
<P>
   Amid spreading anxiety over how those middle people will vote in
November, third parties are keeping their fingers crossed for a
wave of new support, said George Getz, a Libertarian Party
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   But even Libertarians, boasting 166 candidates for Congress,
felt compelled to enlist in the impeachment wars. The party in July
passed a resolution that Clinton be impeached not because of the
sex scandal but because Libertarians believe his efforts to
regulate handguns and to censor the Internet are unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
   What's happening inside the Beltway, says University of
California Professor Charles M. Price, is the two-party system in
overdrive. If Capitol Hill's interest in the scandal does not
reflect the public interest as measured in polls, it's because
Capitol Hill is composed almost entirely of Republicans and
Democrats. (Only one member of Congress is an independent _ Vermont
Rep. Bernard Sanders, who voted against the House impeachment
inquiry.)
</P>
<P>
   Half of Americans, by contrast, call themselves ``independent''
when pollsters call. And for nine months running, the opinions of
Clinton expressed by these independent voters have reflected the
overall national mood almost to the decimal point.
</P>
<P>
   Consider this question from CBS News pollsters earlier this
month: ``Do you believe Bill Clinton is still an effective
president?''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the gap between Republicans and Democrats was
immense. Only four in 10 Republicans said Clinton was still
effective, compared with nearly nine in 10 Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   The ``independent'' response: 68 percent said yes, Clinton was
effective, and 29 percent said no. Remarkably that mirrored the
sentiments of the nation as a whole: 69 percent yes, 29 percent no.
</P>
<P>
   ``Keep watching those independents,'' said poll-tracker Bowman.
``The president's future may hinge on if and when their opinions
change.''

   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ TWA continues operating.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson said TWA wanted to eliminate provisions in the previous
agreement that required TWA to keep the Kansas City overhaul base
and have TWA mechanics do all its maintenance work.
</P>
<P>
   The Machinists union has asked the National Mediation Board to
begin a 30-day countdown, after which workers would be free to
strike. The mediator is meeting with company and union officials
this week.
</P>
<P>
   City officials hope a contract resolution with TWA's workers
will lead to a renewal of the overhaul base's lease. Anderson
agreed that the base's long-term prospects remained uncertain.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're comfortable that TWA will be here after the year 2000,
but it's unclear as to how long,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   TWA's union leaders in Kansas City are urging City Council
members to push for the renewal of the lease.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without a commitment from the city, we may not be able to get
a (union) contract to lock them in to the Kansas City facility,''
Nelson said.
</P>
<P>
   The two issues are not connected, Abels said. TWA's maintenance
system ``is driven by the size of our fleet, not by any collective
bargaining agreement,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Councilwoman Teresa Loar, chairwoman of the City Operations
Committee, said the city would examine what financial assistance
could be provided.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to do everything we can to keep TWA in Kansas City,''
she said. ``We're talking about thousands of jobs, so we would take
a hard look at ways of subsidizing costs for the company.''
</P>
<P>
   Nelson said Cleaver had expressed his support to keep TWA's
maintenance jobs in Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's solidly committed to helping us,'' Nelson said. ``He'd
like to get a lease locked up before he leaves office.''

CITY OFFICIALS NEGOTIATE PLAN TO KEEP TWA MAINTENANCE FACILITY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RANDOLPH HEASTER  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Kansas City is considering options to
renovate or rebuild its jet maintenance base as part of efforts to
persuade Trans World Airlines Inc. to keep its maintenance
operation _ and about 2,200 jobs _ here.
</P>
<P>
   Renovation would cost at least $240 million, according to a
report by Burns &AMP; McDonnell Engineers-Architects-Consultants. The
report was submitted earlier this year to the city Aviation
Department, which is negotiating with TWA to renew its lease on the
overhaul base.
</P>
<P>
   That lease expires in May 2000, and city officials and union
leaders are concerned that the airline may abandon the maintenance
operation at Kansas City International Airport. In union
negotiations, TWA is pushing to eliminate contract provisions
requiring the airline to keep the base open.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a concern that TWA management wants to close the
overhaul base and outsource all their maintenance work,'' said
Councilman Ed Ford.
</P>
<P>
   The airline is in early negotiations with the city, said Mark
Abels, TWA vice president of corporate communications. TWA is
evaluating its entire maintenance system, including sites in Kansas
City, St. Louis, New York and Los Angeles, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The future of the Kansas City overhaul base is being discussed
while TWA negotiates with the Machinists union on a new contract.
The Machinists, who represent about 75 percent of TWA's employees,
have worked under an old contract since September 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have proposed the unlimited outsourcing of our work,''
said Keith Nelson, president of Local 1650. ``If they get that in
the contract, the chances become greater that TWA would phase out
the Kansas City overhaul base at the end of the lease in May
2000.''
</P>
<P>
   Abels declined to comment on outsourcing, but he confirmed that
TWA's bargaining position is to not protect any company facility
from the prospect of downsizing or closing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't give that assurance,'' he said. ``We can't manage a
business that way. Some people think a building creates jobs. We
tend to think a successful business creates jobs.''
</P>
<P>
   Ray Anderson, city aviation director, said his department and
TWA had exchanged information about the overhaul base for more than
a year. In addition, Mayor Emanuel Cleaver has met with TWA
executives at its St. Louis corporate headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's fair to say the discussions taking place are
about a (lease) extension of some form,'' Anderson said. ``We still
have a good 18 months before it expires, and we're hoping to have
another meeting with TWA well before the end of the year.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite those negotiations, questions linger about whether TWA
intends to continue its Kansas City maintenance operation. TWA has
struggled through two bankruptcies, though its finances have
improved recently, and the size of its work force here has
declined.
</P>
<P>
   The airline no longer does much contract work on aircraft of
other carriers at the overhaul base. In addition, TWA has
eliminated older planes from its fleet, such as the jumbo Boeing
747, whose size required it to be serviced at Kansas City's
maintenance center.
</P>
<P>
   As it continues to strengthen its operations, TWA has
reconfigured its fleet to become less of an international carrier
and more of an airline for business travelers. The company has
bought newer planes that require less overall maintenance.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, Lambert-St. Louis International Airport recently
received approval for a $2.6 billion expansion, and union officials
in Kansas City wonder whether that might include shifting more
maintenance work there.
</P>
<P>
   TWA plans to replace the maintenance facility at Lambert but has
not made any decisions regarding the new base to be built there,
Abels said.
</P>
<P>
   As for the overhaul base in Kansas City, less than 60 percent of
it is being used, according to Burns &AMP; McDonnell.
</P>
<P>
   The study examined three possibilities: renovate the existing
facility; build a maintenance base that would include an
administrative office; and build a maintenance facility that would
be surrounded by smaller administrative buildings.
</P>
<P>
   The study indicated that renovation would include consolidating
some operations into one building and demolishing the superhangars
at the base, which would leave a second existing building available
for another tenant.
</P>
<P>
   The overhaul base is not obsolete, but some changes are needed
to make it more attractive, including making it more
energy-efficient, according to Burns &AMP; McDonnell.
</P>
<P>
   One problem with the overhaul base is that most airlines,
including TWA, are using more narrow-bodied planes. If the base
were reconfigured, the airline could service more planes in less
space.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd say there would be a limited number of potential tenants''
in the facility's current form, said Randy Pope of Burns &AMP;
McDonnell. ``But there's a lot of flexibility there, also.''
</P>
<P>
   TWA's maintenance operations are too large, given the size of
the airline, Abels said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's probably too much (maintenance) capacity in our system
right now,'' he said. ``The Kansas City facility, along with St.
Louis, Los Angeles and New York, offers more hangar space than we
really need.''
</P>
<P>
   That does not necessarily mean the Kansas City overhaul base,
TWA's largest, is too big, Abels said. For example, he said TWA
could decide to shift more of its work to that facility. The
airline is studying its needs and has not made any firm decisions
regarding any maintenance facilities, he said.
</P>
<P>
   What TWA decides to do with its Kansas City operations may
depend on the outcome of talks with the Machinists.
</P>
<P>
   The union has said that it wants wages comparable with those of
other airlines. In addition, Nelson said, the union wants
contractual assurances that the overhaul base will remain a part of
the airline as long as TWA continues operating. MORE

MISSOURI CASINO REFERENDUM CAMPAIGN FOUGHT ON MANY FRONTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICK ALM  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Lapel buttons urging passage of the casino
``boats in moats'' amendment Nov. 3 are the real McCoy _ metal
disc, tricolor printing, safety pin and a politically correct union
manufacturing mark.
</P>
<P>
   The anti-casino crowd, on the other hand, is distributing
peel-away paper `stickies' in just one economical color that
feature the ``no'' slash through the word ``slots.''
</P>
<P>
   The contrast is telling.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to money, the Amendment 9 campaign is a contest of
David-and- Goliath proportions. By the end of last month, Missouri
casinos had reported spending $5.5 million. The other side was
nursing a $34,000 war chest that has since grown to about $100,000.
</P>
<P>
   Voters face a difficult choice.
</P>
<P>
   On paper, the election is about amending the Missouri
Constitution to retroactively legalize nine of the state's 15
riverboat casinos that the General Assembly and Missouri Gaming
Commission allowed to operate as far as 1,000 feet off river.
</P>
<P>
   In reality, voters will decide Nov. 3 whether those casinos
survive.
</P>
<P>
   A yes vote would, in effect, overturn a decision last year by
the Missouri Supreme Court that outlawed games of chance, including
slot machines, aboard those boats in moats.
</P>
<P>
   A no vote would set in motion a series of events that probably
would result _ although not immediately _ in a Gaming Commission
order to the affected casinos to unplug their slots, which generate
up to two-thirds of their gross revenue.
</P>
<P>
   If that happens, Missouri would become the first state to
effectively un-legalize casino gambling. And a victory here would
fuel similar fights elsewhere, including Mississippi, where a
debate is under way on whether to outlaw that state's 30 casinos.
</P>
<P>
   Casino operators, such as Las Vegas-based Station Casinos Inc.,
which invested $300 million in its Kansas City operation, are
understandably nervous. So are the estimated 10,000 Missourians who
work in the affected casinos.
</P>
<P>
   And so is Wall Street, where the fiscal health of Missouri's
publicly traded gambling companies hangs in the balance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Investors are concerned,'' said Harry Curtis, who analyzes
gambling- industry stocks for BancBoston Robertson Stephens. ``I'm
hoping for some objective treatment for an industry that was
maligned early on.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of these companies are facing extinction,'' Curtis said.
``I ask myself, `Is this right?' ''
</P>
<P>
   Shutting down casinos is absolutely the right thing to do, says
St. Louis Republican Rep. Todd Akin, whose 1996 lawsuit triggered
the boats-in-moats mess.
</P>
<P>
   ``This isn't just about boats in moats,'' he said. ``This
election is a turning point in what happens with gambling in our
state.''
</P>
<P>
   If the casinos win Nov. 3, Akin says, legislative opposition to
gambling in Jefferson City probably will soften, and gambling will
expand.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this thing passes,'' Akin said, ``I would predict within
three or four years you'd see slots and video poker machines
proliferating in bars around the state.''
</P>
<P>
   If the election in Missouri is a David-and-Goliath struggle, the
casino industry wants voters to think of it as David.
</P>
<P>
   Noting the broad spectrum of mainline religious groups in
Missouri working against Amendment 9, American Gaming Association
President Frank J. Fahrenkopf Jr. said: ``They're Goliath. Every
community has a Methodist church and a Baptist church.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what America is all about,'' he added. ``Since the
republic began, people with strong moral and religious views have
opposed gambling.''
</P>
<P>
   But after a 10-year run of casino gambling that has spread to 26
states, it's clear the moral argument hasn't worked, Fahrenkopf
said. ``We're not suddenly seeing people not going to casinos.''
</P>
<P>
   That's certainly true in Missouri. According to the state's
latest fiscal year accounting, casinos entertained a record 39.5
million visitors who left behind more than $802 million.
</P>
<P>
   Many Missourians, in essence, are voting for the casinos with
their feet and their pocketbooks.
</P>
<P>
   That's why the casinos all summer aided patrons in registering
to vote. The question now for casino executives is whether those
gamblers will show up at the polls Election Day.
</P>
<P>
   The morality card isn't the only one gambling foes are playing.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents are using many of the same economic arguments they
used at the polls in 1992 and 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Again this year, for instance, they quote University of Illinois
Professor John W. Kindt, who has advanced a theory for years that
``for every $1 in tax revenue that gambling raises, it creates $3
in costs to handle economic disruption, compulsive gambling and
crime.''
</P>
<P>
   If Kindt is right _ he has plenty of detractors _ federal, state
and local government coffers in Missouri would have been drained of
at least $481 million in the last fiscal year to salve society's
gambling-induced wounds.
</P>
<P>
   That number is not implausible, but there is no evidence such
government spending has approached that level. The problem with
such theories is that they are all but impossible to prove, or
disprove.
</P>
<P>
   Little unbiased economic research has been done, especially in
Missouri. And even if it had been, the statistics necessary for
such definitive research are slippery at best.
</P>
<P>
   For instance: How many people chose to dine out at casino
restaurants instead of their favorite Main Street eateries last
year? How many compulsive gamblers embezzled from their workplaces?
And just how many compulsive gamblers are there in Missouri,
anyway?
</P>
<P>
   The best research to date estimates that about 5 percent of the
adult U.S. population is at risk to experience some level of
gambling-related financial or emotional problem. That leaves 95
percent who aren't at risk.
</P>
<P>
   Another longstanding Kindt theory argues that for every casino
job created, one is lost elsewhere in the economy. MORE
</P>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ in the economy.
</P>
<P>
   But even Akin acknowledged last week that that had not been the
case _ at least so far _ in Missouri, where the economy has been
booming most of the decade.
</P>
<P>
   ``The effect may not be instantaneous,'' he said. ``It's a
long-term effect.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though the industry calls it gaming, it's still gambling to
most people. The mathematical odds against rolling a 7 or drawing
to an inside straight haven't changed in the gaming '90s.
</P>
<P>
   Every night a relative handful of lucky gamblers do win
jackpots. That's what keeps players coming back for more.
</P>
<P>
   But also every night, the house doesn't lose.
</P>
<P>
   Casinos are cash-generating machines. They remain so despite
restrictive boarding rules and betting limits in Missouri that were
designed to protect problem gamblers from themselves _ but which
also hold down the house take.
</P>
<P>
   Gambling foes admit that a defeat in Missouri would be a setback
to their argument that entertainment-fickle Americans, if nothing
else, are souring on the idea of neighborhood casino gambling.
</P>
<P>
   There's not much evidence of that as the industry continues to
log record revenue every year.
</P>
<P>
   Missouri's casino industry is trying to tighten the focus of the
campaign and not allow Nov. 3 to become a shouting match and
referendum on the political and moral correctness of casino
gambling.
</P>
<P>
   For that reason, riverboat executives refuse to debate their
foes in public and decline most interview requests on the election.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe the people of Missouri care about fairness and care
about jobs,'' said Richard J. Haskins, Midwest general counsel for
Station Casinos.
</P>
<P>
   ``The simple fact of the matter is that boats in moats were
authorized by the General Assembly, the Missouri Gaming Commission
and the local communities.
</P>
<P>
   ``To come back now and threaten over 10,000 good-paying jobs is
simply not right,'' Haskins said. ``It is extremely important to
separate fact from fiction, and we believe the facts speak for
themselves _ 10,000 jobs, $90 million a year in revenue to
education and over $1 billion in private capital investment in the
state.''
</P>
<P>
   Mark Andrews, chairman of the anti-gambling campaign group Show
Me the River, insists that the industry brought its troubles on
itself.
</P>
<P>
   Voters were lulled in 1992 into voting for a nostalgic image of
riverboat gambling, he said, but wound up with sprawling,
land-based complexes, such as Station Casino Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   ``Boats in moats are victims of their own bait and switch,''
Andrews said.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the casinos are on dry land or floating in Missouri's
muddy rivers, however, opponents say the economic and human price
society must pay for gambling isn't worth it.
</P>
<P>
   They said the same things in 1992 and again in 1994, and voters
didn't buy it.
</P>
<P>
   This year, with four years of casino experience under Kansas
City's belt, some of those concerns can now be measured.
</P>
<P>
   National researchers have come to widely divergent conclusions
on whether the presence of legalized gambling tends to increase
suicide rates and personal bankruptcies, as foes claim.
</P>
<P>
   The trends in Kansas City are mixed.
</P>
<P>
   The Jackson County medical examiner's office, for example,
reports that the county's suicide rate has been stable for a
decade.
</P>
<P>
   In the three years before the first riverboats opened in 1994,
Jackson County averaged 106 suicides per year. In the three years
after 1994, the average was 101.
</P>
<P>
   A widely quoted new study by SMR Research Corp. of Hackettstown,
N.J., says there is a strong statistical link between the proximity
of casinos and increases in personal bankruptcy filings _ as much
as 35 percent higher.
</P>
<P>
   Those findings come, however, at a time when similarly huge
increases are being reported nationwide as a result, in part, of
easy bank credit, consumer credit abuse and the erasure of much
consumer debt by liberal bankruptcy laws.
</P>
<P>
   In this region, the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Western
District of Missouri reported a record number of nonbusiness
Chapter 7 bankruptcy filings last year _ 9,294. The figure was
7,685 in 1996 and had averaged 3,281 in the three years before
1994.
</P>
<P>
   Congress is grappling with reform legislation now to toughen
bankruptcy rules so consumers cannot so easily evade their debts _
which increasingly include credit card cash advances used for
gambling.
</P>
<P>
   Several state legislatures, Missouri among them, are debating
whether to bar credit card cash and automated teller machines from
casino properties.
</P>
<P>
   Missouri also is one of the few gambling states that prohibit
casinos from extending house credit _ ``markers'' _ to tapped-out
gamblers.
</P>
<P>
   Last week two of the few researchers who have studied
post-casino Missouri to any degree squared off on whether the
experience has been a net plus or minus for the state's economy.
The result: a draw.
</P>
<P>
   Neither study was conclusive, and each acknowledged it.
</P>
<P>
   Here is what's known: The Kansas City area's five threatened
boats in moats employ more than 5,000 people with a combined annual
payroll of nearly $100 million. They pay an additional $100 million
a year in state and local gaming taxes alone.
</P>
<P>
   But there are hidden facets to the economic question.
</P>
<P>
   The anti-gambling side contends that every dollar spent in a
casino is a dollar not spent at a local business, costing jobs and
marketplace diversity in the long run.
</P>
<P>
   Pro-gambling economists counter that Americans' income rises
every year while family entertainment budgets, as a percentage of
personal spending, have been expanding for years, putting many more
dollars into the equation.
</P>
<P>
   The academic studies of Missouri estimate the effect of gambling
in a range from more than $500 million a year to the good, to
nearly $200 million a year in negative effect in a comprehensive
weighing of new taxes, jobs and economic development against the
costs of problem gambling and economic disruption.
</P>
<P>
   The truth probably will never be known.
</P>
<P>
   But the argument will continue to rage.

   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ It took four games, but Anaheim Mighty Ducks
coach Craig Hartsburg finally got a good look at what his top line
could do when Paul Kariya, Steve Rucchin and Teemu Selanne combined
for three goals and eight points in Anaheim's 5-3 win over Chicago
on Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I could see that every night that would great,'' said
Hartsburg. ``They turned up their game a notch, brought their ``A''
game. The momentum they brought to the game was great.''
</P>
<P>
   Hartsburg was especially impressed by Kariya's shorthanded goal.
The Anaheim winger blocked a shot, got up quickly after being
tripped, got up and had his first shot stopped by goalie Jeff
Hackett. But without breaking stride Kariya got his own rebound and
lifted it over Hackett.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know many ... I don't know if there are any,'' said
Hartsburg when asked how many players in the league could make such
a play. ``The scary thing was that he made it look pretty easy.
Ninty-five percent of the guys in the league might not even be able
to get up to try and make the play.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Hartsburg wasn't so happy with Sunday's practice,
especially the team's worth ethic.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not very happy at all,'' he said. ``We've got come ready
to work everyday and when we practice like we did today it shows
that we aren't there yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a fine line between winning and losing and those who
pay the price usually get on the right side of the line.''
</P>
<P>
   In particular, Hartsburg was upset by the work, or lack of it,
on the power play.
</P>
<P>
   And Selanne certainly wasn't about debate the issure.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was right, on the power play we were just floating, said
Selanne. ``Our minds weren't there, we thought we were working but
we weren't.
</P>
<P>
   ``We should feel ashamed, you can't get better if you're not
honest with yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   Kariya gave the trainers a little scare on Sunday when he fell
to the ice and started vomiting.
</P>
<P>
   After practice, Kariya, who is wearing a mouth guard for first
time this time, didn't really want to talk about the incident. He
did said he was not ill and just gagged.
</P>
<P>
   Selanne who scored his first two goals of the season against
Chicago said Hartsburg and the Ducks remained calm despite losing
the first three games of the season-opening trip.
</P>
<P>
   ``Harts went through a 0-7 start (with Chicago) last year, but
he wasn't panicking,'' Selanne said. ``After Montreal we had a
meeting on the plane and said we had to stay positive ... we knew
we were going in the right direction.''
</P>
<P>
   But after the Ducks relaxed with a team outing to see the movie
Roxbury, Selanne said Anaheim knew a win in Chicago would give it a
much needed boost.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was big,'' he said. ``It was lets win or be miserable for
five days (until they would play again).''
</P>
<P>
   Goalie Guy Hebert, despite suffering a Grade I shoulder
separation late in the exhibition season, played the final three
games of the road trip after missing the season opener in
Washington. He is expected to start the home opener against Boston
on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The shoulder is fine,'' said Hebert. ``I don't think it (the
injury) is all gone, but I'm very happy with the way it held up.''
</P>
<P>
   Josef Marha, sideline since the opening game of the season with
a sprained right ankle, skated briefly on Saturday and Sunday. But
the Ducks forward is not expected back in the lineup anytime soon.

<P>
   TYLER, Texas _ When this year's Rose Queen walked onto the stage
on Thursday night in her jeweled gown with a 16-foot train, she
became part of a tradition dating to 1933, when this East Texas
town might have actually deserved its nickname, ``Rose Capital of
the Nation.''
</P>
<P>
   Tourists from across the state and the nation, and even from
some foreign countries, come to the annual Texas Rose Festival,
which reaches a crescendo in a Saturday morning parade featuring
floats heavy with roses that carry elaborately costumed duchesses,
ladies in waiting and, of course, the queen.
</P>
<P>
   But the festival is rapidly becoming the most colorful part of
Tyler's rose industry. The days when most of the bushes containing
red, yellow and pink roses sold in the United States were grown on
this sandy stretch of Texas prairie are long gone. Today, if a
local man makes his living in roses, he is just as likely to do it
packaging rose bushes grown elsewhere _ in California or Arizona,
perhaps.
</P>
<P>
   Only 10 to 15 major growers are left of the literally hundreds
who grew roses here in the late 1950s, when Tyler produced more
than 20 million bushes a year.
</P>
<P>
   Cary Nix, who supplied most of the 16,000 roses used to decorate
this year's 13 festival floats, is one of the few local growers
remaining. ``It's gone downhill pretty quick,'' he said of the
business. ``A lot of the young kids don't want to take it up.''
</P>
<P>
   Factories _ making tires, air conditioners and other products _
have moved into this town of 80,000, as they have in other rural
communities, providing steady jobs and higher hourly wages than
farm labor. Young people have gone away to college and taken desk
jobs. Then there is the weather.
</P>
<P>
   One of the area's benefits is its long growing season _ about
245 days. But a hard freeze can still come early and kill bushes,
and a drought can dry them up when growers do not have irrigation
systems. The weather in competing areas, like California, is more
predictable.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard work,'' Nix said, ``and a lot of people just found
something else to get into that wasn't such a gamble.''
</P>
<P>
   Nix, 39, is a fourth-generation rose grower. His 19-year-old
son, Chad, donned white tie and tails to escort the Duchess of the
Rose Growers to the coronation this year. But Nix said Chad wants
no part of rose farming.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wants to get his degree in business,'' Nix said. ``He wants
to kind of get into marketing.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Nix's 11-year-old son turns up his nose at the idea. Unless
something changes, Nix will be the last of his line in the
business.
</P>
<P>
   Roses are not the first thing one thinks of when Texas comes to
mind _ despite the song ``The Yellow Rose of Texas.'' The Lone Star
State is more commonly associated with mesquite and scrub brush
than with showy flowers.
</P>
<P>
   But roses were first grown here commercially in the mid-1800s,
imported by the Shamburger family, who came to the area from
Tennessee. Others took up growing roses after a plant disease
destroyed most of the area's fruit trees in the early 1900s.
</P>
<P>
   The industry boomed in the 1940s and '50s, as refrigeration made
the cold storage of roses possible and young World War II veterans
returned to Tyler and formed cooperatives to market their roses,
said Brent Pemberton, a researcher in ornamental plants at Texas
A&AMP;M University.
</P>
<P>
   In 1949, 44 percent of all the rose bushes sold in the United
States were produced in Tyler, he said. But only 5 million bushes
will be grown in Tyler this year, though an additional 17 million
will be processed here. Of the 50 million roses grown in the United
States, Pemberton said, California is expected to produce 30
million plants, while Arizona is expected to grow 15 million.
</P>
<P>
   So while tourists may bring more than $2 million into the local
economy during this festival, the Texas rose it celebrates has been
toppled from its throne by fancier plants from farther west.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   California growers, Jackson &AMP; Perkins in particular, have been
adept at marketing to more affluent consumers, said Pemberton. They
spend money to develop new hybrids and sell them by mail order
through glossy catalogs.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Texas growers have kept to old stand-bys like Mister
Lincoln, a red tea rose, and Peace, which has yellow-pink blossoms.
Their crop is more likely to go to garden centers and nurseries,
sometimes sold as a loss leader.
</P>
<P>
   Texans like Nix display a trace of cynicism about their
competitors' ability to charge higher prices. ``They'll come up
with a new pink and there's already a pink the same color,'' he
said. ``Maybe they just put out new names for them.''
</P>
<P>
   But such business concerns don't seem to matter at festival
time.
</P>
<P>
   The social whirl surrounding the festival and the queen's
coronation have become a part of Tyler culture _ the town's version
of a debutante ball.
</P>
<P>
   The queen's parents may spend $100,000 or more to buy her an
extravagant gown, sponsor a float for her to ride and hold a free
afternoon tea at Tyler's municipal rose garden, said Lyn Long, one
of the women who volunteer to arrange the rose baskets for the
floats.
</P>
<P>
   Just having your daughter be a lady in waiting costs at least
$10,000, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a little snobbish thing,'' Mrs. Long added, only half
joking. ``Every mother wants their daughter to grow up and be in
the Rose Festival.''
</P>
<P>
   The question is: How many daughters _ or sons _ will want to
work in the fields that the festival celebrates?

TESTING 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Pa., N.J.)   SAMUEL J. MESSICK, 67, LEADER IN EDUCATIONAL(lh) 
 By FORD BURKHART   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dr. Samuel J. Messick, a leader in educational testing who
argued for restraint in the use of student test scores, died Oct. 6
at the University of Pennsylvania Medical Center in Philadelphia.
He was 67 and lived in Pennington, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was congestive heart failure, family members said.
</P>
<P>
   Messick spent his career with the Educational Testing Service in
Princeton, N.J., retired as a vice president and assumed the
position, created for him, of distinguished research scientist.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was in the forefront of the mathematics and statistics of
psychometrics,'' said Dr. Henry Chauncey, who became the first
president of the testing service in 1947. ``But he also knew how
the educational system worked, its values, and what impact testing
could have on schools and colleges.''
</P>
<P>
   Messick's research helped shape the SAT, a crucial part of
college admissions, which the testing service creates and
administers for the College Board. But he cautioned that the scores
should be kept in perspective.
</P>
<P>
   When the National Collegiate Athletic Association wanted to use
test scores to set an absolute cutoff for playing sports, Messick
resisted, arguing for use of scores only with other indicators.
</P>
<P>
   Messick wrote 20 books and 175 scholarly articles, many arguing
that testing should never be used to discriminate against children
from disadvantaged backgrounds, who tend to score below more
affluent counterparts on standardized tests.
</P>
<P>
   Samuel James Messick grew up in Philadelphia, the son of a
police officer who died when Messick was a child. He studied
psychology at the University of Pennsylvania. After graduating with
a B.A. in 1950, he went on to study at Princeton and became a
fellow at the testing service. After he received his M.A. and Ph.D.
at Princeton, he joined the staff of the testing service.
</P>
<P>
   Survivors include his wife of 46 years, Betty Messick; sons
Jonathan of Long Branch, N.J.; and Christopher of Ewing Township,
N.J.; daughters Marjorie Hurley of Blue Bell, Pa., and Kathy Mora
of Ewing Township, N.J., and six grandchildren.

EDITORIAL: EXPENSIVE FANTASIES ON IRAQ 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Monday, Oct. 19:
</P>
<P>
   Congress' desire to hasten the removal of Saddam Hussein from
power in Baghdad is understandable. But throwing money and weapons
at Iraq's feeble and fractious opposition will not achieve the
intended results.
</P>
<P>
   This month Congress authorized the Pentagon and State Department
to transfer up to $97 million in U.S. military equipment to Iraq's
unreliable opposition groups in the hope that they can somehow
overthrow the Iraqi dictator and replace him with a democratic
government. The White House must firmly resist any temptation to
arm these discredited organizations. There are more useful, less
expensive ways to nurture future democracy. They include
broadcasting independent news into Iraq, which receives modest
funding in the new legislation, and the administration's effort to
encourage the development of independent civil associations in
Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   Saddam has spent the past two decades building a police state to
protect his power. Internal security forces and military units move
swiftly to crush opposition. Sending Iraqi opposition groups in
their present disarray against this state power would be senseless,
and would complicate efforts to maintain the international
sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   The intended beneficiaries of U.S. support include the Iraqi
National Congress, which represents almost no one and has failed to
produce results with aid it previously received from Washington.
Also included are the two main Kurdish militias, which have spent
more energy fighting each other than battling Saddam.
</P>
<P>
   Some of these groups are almost certainly taking part in a
separate set of covert operations against the Iraqi government
organized and financed by the CIA. Unfortunately, the CIA still
seems to know very little about the internal political life of the
Iraqi regime. The agency has devoted most of its efforts to
encouraging plots within the military forces. These have invariably
been detected by Hussein's closest aides and then manipulated to
identify and execute potentially disloyal commanders.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of dreaming about military rebellions, Washington should
devote its energy and resources to preventing Baghdad from
rebuilding an arsenal of biological and chemical weapons. That work
has all but ceased in the face of Iraqi resistance and an erosion
of international support.

RELIGIOUS CIRCUMCISION IN A CHANGING WORLD
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By NADINE BROZAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BETHESDA, Md. _ Like any other group of professional colleagues
meeting for a conference, the members of the national organization
of men and women certified by the Reform Jewish movement to perform
ritual circumcisions had but one focus of conversation this
weekend: shop talk.
</P>
<P>
   Barely had the hors d'oeuvres been passed at the opening Sabbath
dinner on Friday in the Tragara restaurant here than the 11 men and
six women who perform the rituals plunged into chat about the bris,
or brith milah, trading anecdotes, experiences and practical advice
along with the latest, or sometimes most ancient, bris jokes.
</P>
<P>
   The sacred ritual they perform on a boy on the eighth day after
his birth signifies his covenant with God and membership in the
Jewish faith and is as old as the religion itself. The patriarch
Abraham performed it for his son Isaac and on himself.
</P>
<P>
   But today, though the meaning has not changed, the ceremony in
some circles has, as the religious person who performs it, the
mohel, faces some confounding social issues.
</P>
<P>
   Participants at the conference asked, for example, how the
mohalim (the plural form for mohel, pronounced moyle) could make
the rite as meaningful as possible to a gay or lesbian couple who
have given birth to or adopted a baby? Does the child of an
interfaith couple need do be immersed in a mikvah, or ritual bath,
or does the bris itself suffice? What should the mohel do when
families ask for a postponement so that Grandmother can get an
affordable air fare to attend? Is a religious circumcision covered
by insurance or managed care? How do mohalim use the Internet to
inform the public?
</P>
<P>
   The Reform mohalim and their female counterparts, the mohalot,
bear little resemblance to the traditional Orthodox male mohel, who
most likely practices his calling full-time and permits little, if
any, innovation in the ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   In the last 14 years, the Reform movement has developed its own
group of mohalim, requiring that they be either doctors or nurse
practitioners. Of the 17 mohalim and mohalot at the meeting of the
National Organization of American Mohalim-Mohalot, 16 were doctors
with specialties like obstetrics, plastic surgery or family
medicine. One was a nurse-midwife.
</P>
<P>
   There are 206 mohalim in the United States, 25 of them women,
who have fulfilled the standards of the Brit Milah Board of Reform
Judaism, a joint program of three central institutions of the
Reform movement: Hebrew Union College-Jewish Institute of Religion,
the Union of American Hebrew Congregations and the Central
Conference of American Rabbis.
</P>
<P>
   The development of mohalim within the Reform movement began in
1984, a year after the Central Conference of American Rabbis passed
a resolution declaring the principle of patrilineal descent. That
meant that children born of interfaith marriages whose fathers were
Jewish could be considered Jewish, a dramatic departure from the
matrilineal tradition holding that only those born to a Jewish
mother are considered Jewish.
</P>
<P>
   That opened the door to new problems and new practices of
circumcision that had generally been performed either by an
Orthodox mohel or by a surgeon in the hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Rabbi Lewis M. Barth, dean of the Los Angeles branch of Hebrew
Union College-Jewish Institute of Religion and a founder of the
mohalim training program, said in a telephone interview before the
meeting, ``There was concern that the Orthodox mohalim would not
have a respectful attitude toward Reform Judaism or that they would
not accept the Jewish status of a mother who had converted or a
child whose Jewry came through the father.''
</P>
<P>
   The training program _ two hours a week for 14 weeks _ was
established in Los Angeles and then offered in New York and other
cities. ``It teaches the religious, historical, liturgical, and
modern understanding of the ceremony with the intention of
preparing doctors to perform it,'' said Barth.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the process, the students take exams and write
personal statements in order to be certified.
</P>
<P>
   A similar but shorter program was offered in the Conservative
movement through the Jewish Theological Seminary and Rabbinical
Assembly in 1989, 1990 and 1992. It has not been given since. Rabbi
Elliot Schoenberg, associate executive director of the Rabbinical
Assembly explained, ``We have filled our need.'' Sixty people
completed the program, four of them women.
</P>
<P>
   The Orthodox movement has made no changes in the way it trains
mohalim or defines their roles. ``There is no individualism in the
service,'' said Rabbi Dr. Moshe David Tendler, who is a professor
of Talmudic law, chairman of the biology department and professor
of medical ethics at Yeshiva University. ``The basic service is the
blessing by the mohel and by the father.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Orthodox tenets do not permit women to serve as rabbis
or cantors, or even to read from the Torah, there is nothing to
keep them from being mohalim.
</P>
<P>
   Citing a passage in the Shulhan Arukh, the ancient code of
Jewish law, that says minors, slaves and women can perform
circumcisions, Tendler said, ``This is not a function of being a
leader of men. It is a surgical procedure, but I know of no
Orthodox woman who wants to be a mohalot.''
</P>
<P>
   The women at the Reform conference said that rarely, if ever,
had they faced opposition on the basis of their sex. ``Most people
find it a plus,'' said Dr. Marjorie Cramer, a Manhattan plastic
surgeon who has been performing circumcisions for 14 years.
</P>

   When her rabbi in Brooklyn Heights suggested she enroll in the
course, Dr. Cramer said, she asked him, `` `Why would I want to do
such a sexist thing, a ritual only for boys?' I went to the course
not knowing if I wanted to do it at all. By the end of the first
class, I was hooked. It became the way to unite my spiritual life
with what I do professionally.''

   In some situations, the mohel serves as an unaffiliated family's
first conduit into a Jewish community. ``Sometimes they are not
ready to make a decision to affiliate with a synagogue yet,'' Dr.
Barry Meisel, a Westchester obstetrician and chairman of the Brit
Milah Board of Reform Judaism, said. ``If we are warm and welcoming
and give them a meaningful experience with the bris, perhaps that
will point them in that direction.''
</P>
<P>
   That is not always an easy task, particularly when there are
sensitive personal issues at stake. The mohalim find they must be
creative without violating any tradition or principle.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Dorothy Greenbaum, a pediatrician with a practice in the
Howard Beach section of Queens, described three cases of Jewish
couples who had adopted babies who were not Jewish and wanted to
insure that the children would be accepted as Jews in all sectors
of the faith.
</P>
<P>
   ``Each family wanted something included in their ritual that
would capture the spirit of mikvah submersion,'' Dr. Greenbaum
said. A mikvah is normally an integral part of conversion for
adults and children.
</P>
<P>
   ``So I did something to construct a modern alternative to
mikvah, even though in the Reform movement bris itself is
considered to be conversion,'' she said. ``I went back into
tradition and found what Moses had done when he anointed Aaron and
his sons into the priesthood. I took bottled water and touched the
babies' ears, saying, `May your ears always be open to prayer,' the
hands, `to do acts of loving kindness' and to the feet `to walk in
the path of righteousness.'''

   LAS VEGAS _ For the second time in 30 days, Mike Tyson will
appear before the Nevada State Athletic Commission here Monday and
try to convince its five members that he should be given back his
boxing license.
</P>
<P>
   The commission revoked Tyson's license on July 9, 1997, after he
bit Evander Holyfield's ears during their heavyweight championship
bout on June 28, 1997. The commission is trying to determine
whether Tyson is prone to snap again if he gets back into the ring.
If Tyson, 32, is denied a license, he can't apply again until Oct.
19, 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Tyson was expected to answer the commission's questions
regarding his mental fitness and their questions regarding an Aug.
31 incident in Gaithersburg, Md., where he allegedly assaulted two
men following a traffic mishap involving him and his wife.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's open to whatever the commission wants to know,'' said
Shelly Finkel, Tyson's boxing adviser.

PENGUINS' SLIDE GOES FROM STANLEY CUP TO CHAPTER 11
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By JOE LAPOINTE    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PITTSBURGH _ A bankrupt franchise in a healthy sports league is
like a neglected house on a pleasant and prosperous street. The
decaying dwelling may be surrounded by neat homes with trim lawns,
painted gutters and clean picture windows. But it is difficult to
ignore the eyesore next door with the overgrown shrubs, the plywood
over the broken glass and the police car in the driveway to break
up the fight between the dysfunctional spouses.
</P>
<P>
   The franchise in this case is the Pittsburgh Penguins, who have
replaced the Islanders as the embarrassment of the National Hockey
League. Yes, the Islanders may have tried recently to evict
themselves from their own arena during a bitter lease dispute and,
yes, their television rights holder gives their games less respect
than critics give Howard Stern's new show. But it is only a sour
joke that Islanders fans chant the name of a recent owner sent to
jail for financial fraud. At least the current owners who replaced
him are legally clean and have not declared bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
   Roger Marino's Penguins filed for Chapter 11 last week, and the
thought of jail crossed the mind of Pittsburgh's co-owner. Marino
wasn't thinking about either John Spano of the Islanders or Bruce
McNall, the recent chairman of the NHL Board of Governors, who also
was jailed for financial fraud. Marino instead reacted to the news
that the mayor of Pittsburgh was suing the team for unpaid taxes
and that the district attorney for Allegheny County was
investigating.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have young children,'' Marino said. ``Debtors prison has
gone away a long time ago.''
</P>
<P>
   So have Spano, McNall and the shame attached to a business
filing for bankruptcy. Marino, co-owner with Howard Baldwin, is not
personally broke. Far from it. He has many high-tech millions. He
left his luxury box after Saturday's 3-3 tie with the Rangers to
fly by private jet to his home in Massachusetts. Marino is expected
to show up in New York this week with Baldwin in the office of NHL
Commissioner Gary Bettman. For the moment, these two have called a
truce in their public feud, possibly because they have so many
common enemies. Along with the angry public officials, the Penguins
are in litigation with the landlord and the television rights
holders. And Mario Lemieux, the retired Penguins hero, has demanded
the $28.6 million they owe him.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the co-owners will discuss with Bettman their wish to
renegotiate for a better lease from Spectacor Management Group,
which runs their building as well as Nassau Coliseum. They might
discuss how the Penguins, according to a team spokesman, have never
financially recovered from the 15-week lockout that Bettman
inflicted on the NHL in 1994-95. Or they could talk about their
hopes for a new arena, despite the fact that the current building _
recently renovated with public funds _ is a big, bright edifice
with excellent sight lines and usually filled with thousands of
loyal fans.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike most NHL cities, Pittsburgh has a big-league feel but no
competition from the National Basketball Association. The arena,
nicknamed ``the Igloo,'' is a big dome on top of a hill surrounded
by city streets in the downtown district. In the last decade,
thanks in part to the two Stanley Cup championships of 1991 and
1992, Pittsburgh is one of the league's most upbeat hockey venues.
More than most crowds, the Penguins fans wear team jerseys, with
names of favorite players on the back. Step 10 yards into the lobby
and you might meet an usher who will tell you he has worked there
since before the Penguins started in 1967, that he hired on back
when the Pittsburgh Hornets were a jewel of the American Hockey
League.
</P>
<P>
   In most cities that have both the NHL and the NBA, hockey gets
less local news media attention. Newspaper columnists and
broadcasting celebrities amuse their friends by bragging about
their hockey ignorance. Not so in Pittsburgh, where hockey
information and opinion is widespread. Not all is positive.
Columnist Brian O'Neill, writing in the Post-Gazette Sunday about
more public money for the Penguins, said: ``Fat chance. Let the ice
melt first.''
</P>
<P>
   That's not about to happen, at least not yet. The players were
paid last week, with the help of a personal loan from Marino, who
will collect interest on the loan.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got my check,'' said defenseman Darius Kasparaitis. Did it
clear the bank? he was asked. ``I'll let you know Monday,'' he said
with a smile.
</P>
<P>
   The bankruptcy filing was done with the approval of the league,
according to Frank Brown, an NHL spokesman. He stressed Sunday that
Chapter 11 is the lesser of two evils, not as worrisome as Chapter
7, which would allow the creditors to take over. Brown said other
franchises in other sports have gone through the same procedures
and emerged in good health. ``This is not a death knell,'' Brown
said.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, ``The Burgh's'' downtown district seemed as alive as
ever Saturday night as the fans filed out and down the hill into
the warm autumn air. Had Marino stuck around, he could have walked
down 6th Avenue to a busy hotel where business executives were
assembled for the Fortune 500 Forum. Around the hotel, the streets
were thick with limousines and luxury sedans of chief executive
officers. Marino could have strolled among the high-roller
vehicles, just to chat or pass a hat.

JOSEPH MACHLIS, 92, AUTHOR OF MUSIC TEXTBOOK 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By ALLAN KOZINN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Joseph Machlis, an author and opera translator, whose
1955 textbook, ``The Enjoyment of Music,'' is one of the most
popular music-appreciation books published in English, died on
Saturday at his home in Manhattan. He was 92.
</P>
<P>
   Machlis was a familiar figure in the classical-music world,
although to see him _ a small, frail-looking man with thick glasses
and a shock of unruly white hair _ one would not have guessed that
he was a powerhouse into his 90s. Around his 85th birthday, he told
a reporter that he still exercised regularly and swam 50 laps a
day.
</P>
<P>
   He was a fixture at the opera house, recitals and new-music
concerts, and he helped many young musicians, particularly
pianists, by letting them perform for invited audiences at his
apartment on East 57th Street, by lobbying critics on their behalf,
or by quietly providing financial support for their work.
</P>
<P>
   He maintained that apartment solely for musicales and lavish
parties, where musicians, literary figures and politicians mingled.
The apartment he called home, also on the East Side, was a cramped
studio with an antique refrigerator, a camp cot and stacks of
papers representing various projects in progress. He said that the
spaciousness of the other apartment upset his equilibrium.
</P>
<P>
   Machlis' 90th-birthday celebration, in 1996, was an indication
of the esteem in which he was held. For a party given by his
publisher, W.W. Norton, 13 American composers _ among them Milton
Babbitt, Ned Rorem, Lukas Foss, John Corigliano, Hugo Weisgall,
Yehudi Wyner and George Perle _ supplied humorous musical tributes
to him.
</P>
<P>
   Machlis was born in Riga, Latvia, in 1906, but moved to New York
when he was 3 and grew up in Brooklyn, where he studied the piano.
After he completed his bachelor's degree at City College, in 1927,
he won a scholarship from the Steinway piano company to study in
France.
</P>
<P>
   Upon his return, Machlis decided not to pursue a concert career.
He earned his master's degree in English literature from Columbia
University while supporting himself by giving piano lessons, and in
1938 he joined the music faculty at Queens College, where he taught
for 35 years. After retiring from Queens College, he taught at the
Juilliard School.
</P>
<P>
   Early in his career, Machlis developed a new approach to
teaching music history.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had noticed teachers beginning with medieval music,'' he
told The New York Times in 1985. ``But I thought, `Why not start
with something more interesting and go backwards?' So I began with
Tchaikovsky and Grieg to arouse students' interest. Just like if
you wanted to teach English lit, you would start with Mailer and
Tom Wolfe and go backwards to `Beowulf.'''
</P>
<P>
   When a representative of W.W. Norton asked Machlis to write a
textbook in the early 1950s, his course notes became the basis of
``The Enjoyment of Music.'' Since its original publication, the
book has sold more than 2 million copies and has undergone several
revisions, the most recent with a co-author, Kristine Forney.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Machlis also wrote ``Introduction to Contemporary Music'' (1963)
and two books for younger readers, ``Composers of Our Time'' (1963)
and ``Getting to Know Music'' (1966).
</P>
<P>
   He was a respected translator of opera librettos. His English
edition of Poulenc's ``Dialogues of the Carmelites'' is still used
by the Metropolitan Opera, and many of his translations were used
in televised NBC Opera productions starting in the 1950s. Among the
works he translated were Beethoven's ``Fidelio,'' Mussorgsky's
``Boris Godunov,'' Prokofiev's ``Fiery Angel,'' Puccini's
``Boheme'' and Falla's ``Atlantida.''
</P>
<P>
   Machlis also wrote six novels between 1964 and 1990, including
``The Career of Magda V,'' widely regarded as a roman a clef about
the soprano Elisabeth Schwarzkopf, although Machlis vehemently
denied this; ``Stefan in Love''; and ``Allegro.'' His earlier
novels were published under the name George Selcamm (the surname
being Machlis, phonetically, backward). Machlis said that this was
at Norton's insistence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Norton thought I was writing a sexy book,'' he explained,
``and my textbooks were used in a lot of Catholic schools.''
</P>
<P>
   Machlis, a bachelor, left no immediate family.

D'AMATO AND SCHUMER VIE FOR SUPPORT FROM JEWISH VOTERS

 By ADAM NAGOURNEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ With two survivors of the Holocaust at his side and a
rabbi leading his rally, Sen. Alfonse D'Amato stood solemnly at the
Holocaust Memorial in Manhattan on Sunday, promoting his efforts on
behalf of Jewish voters and joining Jewish supporters in assailing
his opponent, Rep. Charles Schumer, over issues of concern to
Israel and to Jews.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Jewish community doesn't have a better friend than Sen.
D'Amato,'' Alice Fischer, 69, a yeshiva instructor who survived the
Bergen-Belsen concentration camp, said, speaking gravely in a thick
Hungarian accent as D'Amato sat stiffly in a seat behind her. By
contrast, Mrs. Fischer said, ``the opponent'' had voted against the
use of force against Saddam Hussein in 1991 and failed to endorse
Edward Koch over David Dinkins in New York City's ethnically
contentious mayoral primary in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   Within two hours, Schumer had dispatched two of his own
prominent Jewish supporters _ New York City Comptroller Alan Hevesi
and Rep. Jerrold Nadler of Manhattan _ to the same strip of
concrete, where they accused D'Amato of exploiting the Holocaust
for political gain. Hevesi and Nadler asserted that the Democratic
Senate candidate's record on issues of concern to Jewish voters
easily matched that offered by D'Amato, the Republican.
</P>
<P>
   This searing exchange between the two campaigns _ set against
the backdrop of the Holocaust Memorial that stands across First
Avenue from the United Nations Building _ stood in testimony Sunday
to an unusual dynamic that is at the heart of this closely watched
contest in New York.
</P>
<P>
   This is a race between a Roman Catholic senator, known from
Washington to New York as one of the nation's leading advocates for
Jewish causes, and a Jewish congressman from Brooklyn, who has
sought just as vigorously to identify himself with issues of
concern to Jewish voters.
</P>
<P>
   Their clash Sunday was over a segment of New York's electorate
that _ while proportionately smaller and less influential than it
was a generation ago _ could well prove critical to the outcome of
this contest. As a rule, aides to both campaigns said, Jewish
voters are more likely to vote, which could inflate their influence
if the contest ends up drawing a low turnout at the polls. They are
also more likely to make contributions.
</P>
<P>
   What is more, New York Jewish voters are overwhelmingly
Democratic and based in New York City, making them essential to
Schumer's victory. Any success that D'Amato has in stripping away
voters who, as a matter of history, will be considered likely to be
part of Schumer's political base, can be problematic for the
Democratic challenger in a race this close. D'Amato's advisers said
the event was the first of several, including, in all probability a
television advertisement that would be aimed at drawing Jewish
support away from Schumer.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is going to be a very difficult choice because Schumer is
a textbook kind of candidate _ Harvard graduate, children in public
schools _ in terms of liberal Jewish values,'' said Mitchell Moss,
director of the Taub Urban Research Center at New York University.
``But he is going against someone who has spent years attending to
the needs of the Jewish community.''
</P>
<P>
   The fruits of D'Amato's attention to those kind of voters were
on display Sunday morning as the senator surrounded himself with
women and men in yarmulkes, each taking a turn to praise D'Amato's
attention to Jewish issues.
</P>
<P>
   They warmly recounted D'Amato's central role in forcing Swiss
banks to compensate Holocaust victims whose families' funds were
looted by the Nazis, and the senator's record of advocating in
Washington for Israel's security interests.
</P>
<P>
   With equal fervor, they attacked Schumer's record in Congress,
even applying the same basic thrust of D'Amato's campaign _ that
Schumer missed votes in Congress this year _ to the matter of the
Holocaust. Schumer was absent, D'Amato and his supporters said,
during a vote in the Banking Committee, on which he serves, on
establishing a presidential commission to review Holocaust claims,
and at another vote making the U.S. Capitol Rotunda available for a
Holocaust commemoration.
</P>
<P>
   ``He missed the vote to make the Capitol Rotunda available for a
magnificent Holocaust commemoration ceremony,'' D'Amato said.
``That's the difference. I've been there. I understand that you've
got to be there _ even if it means that there are political events
that you'd like to make, but you can't.''
</P>
<P>
   Later that afternoon, campaigning on Long Island, Schumer
angrily criticized D'Amato for arranging what was an unusual
political event, even in the unruly world of New York ethnic
politics: a news conference in which Holocaust survivors attacked a
prominent Jewish politician.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a shame that Al D'Amato would stoop to using the
Holocaust for political purposes,'' he said. ``My record on
Holocaust, on Jewish issues, is second to none. And I think this
is, just, it shows what kind of man he is.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Hevesi, the comptroller, made a similar point. ``I am really
angry about this,'' he said in a telephone interview. ``Using the
Holocaust for political purposes trivializes the Holocaust. That's
a disgrace. You don't use it for political advantage against a
Jewish leader who has been right on every issue that is pertinent
to the Jewish community.
</P>
<P>
   D'Amato's aides defended the event with Holocaust survivors,
saying they were trying to spotlight the senator's record with
Jewish voters.
</P>
<P>
   D'Amato, taking a cue from Mrs. Fischer, criticized the
congressman's 1991 vote against authorizing President George Bush
to use force to repel Saddam Hussein from the Persian Gulf.
</P>
<P>
   ``For him to have voted against sending troops to Saddam Hussein
was wrong,'' D'Amato said, ``because not only were we talking about
the security of Israel, we were talking about a problem as it
related to the entire region.''
</P>
<P>
   Schumer responded by saying he based his vote on his belief that
the Bush administration had offered ``no clear plan on how to deal
with Saddam Hussein.''

QB ILLS DETRACT FROM PROGRESS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ USC starting quarterback Mike Van Raaphorst's
nausea attacks are causing enough concern that he will undergo
medical tests today as the Trojans attempt to figure out why he
became ill during their 42-14 victory over Washington State.
</P>
<P>
   The tests might also determine if there is any connection
between this latest incident and the fact Van Raaphorst became ill
before two other games this season.
</P>
<P>
   As for growing suspicions that Van Raaphorst is suffering from
nerves or stress, the sophomore quarterback steadfastly denied
those rumors.
</P>
<P>
   ``No. Definitely not,'' he said. ``I don't think I would get
nervous after throwing a touchdown pass (in the first quarter).''
</P>
<P>
   Van Raaphorst received a flu shot earlier in the week, but he
didn't know if that _ or a hit he took in the stomach Saturday
night _ contributed to his nausea.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just felt terrible,'' Van Raaphorst said. ``They're going to
do some stuff and see what's wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   USC officials said two other players _ tight ends Antoine Harris
and Lonnie Ford _ also experienced nausea during the game. But Van
Raaphorst also suffered food poisoning before the season-opener
against Purdue and stomach flu before Florida State.
</P>
<P>
   Van Raaphorst's mystery illness was the only setback the Trojans
suffered against the Cougars, and he was impressively replaced by
freshman Carson Palmer, who demonstrated he has the charisma and
skill to lead the Trojans.
</P>
<P>
   After its most resounding victory of the season, it's ironic
that USC's quarterback questions continue to overshadow much of
what the Trojans accomplished at Washington State. USC (5-2, 3-1)
had its year teetering toward disaster after last week's horrible
loss to California, but the Trojans regrouped with perhaps their
best effort of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Look no further than middle linebacker Chris Claiborne, who
clearly stepped up his play following the loss to Cal.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in a portion of the season where it can go either way.
We can't lose another game,'' Claiborne said. ``Last week we didn't
have that thought and it burned us. I just want us as a team to
work on our killer instinct and finish people. I'm going to stay on
guys for the rest of the season.''
</P>
<P>
   Claiborne certainly did his part, with two interceptions,
including a 25-yard touchdown return.
</P>
<P>
   ``What can you say?'' USC coach Paul Hackett said. ``If he's not
the best linebacker in the country, I don't know who is. The guy,
he's unbelievable.''
</P>
<P>
   Claiborne has ways of turning games around, much like wide
receiver R. Jay Soward, who scored two touchdowns. But even the
loquacious Soward couldn't keep mum about the influence Palmer
sometimes has on the offense. Whether or not Palmer was
responsible, USC outscored Washington State 28-0 as soon as he
entered the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love Carson. I got excited (when he came),'' Soward said.
``Mike's good, too, but I love to see Carson come into a game. He's
a playmaker.''
</P>
<P>
   Palmer's status this week against Oregon probably depends more
on Van Raaphorst's health, but Palmer is saying all the right
things while continuing to make a bid for the starting position.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a coaches decision. (Mike) played great. It's still
Mike's job,'' Palmer said.
</P>
<P>
   Hackett was more pleased that USC survived its trip to Pullman
without committing a single turnover.
</P>
<P>
   ``The offense came up into the Northwest on a rainy evening and
did not turn the ball over,'' Hackett said. ``... We're playing in
their backyard, they play in this junk all the time, we have a wet
ball, we have a rainy day and we don't turn the ball over.''

   NEW YORK _ A shaky bullpen can destroy a team in the postseason.
Just ask the Braves.
</P>
<P>
   But what was supposed to be their big strength for the Padres is
quickly turning into their stumbling block.
</P>
<P>
   The problems for the San Diego pen started in the league
championship against Atlanta and came to a head in Game 1 of the
World Series Saturday when their relievers gave up a game-tying,
three-run home run to the Chuck Knoblauch in the seventh inning and
a what turned out to the game-winning runs on a grand slam to Tino
Martinez.
</P>
<P>
   This can turn a Series around quickly and certainly gave the
Yankees the momentum going into Game 2.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think last night was indicative of how I feel about my
bullpen,'' Padres manager Bruce Bochy said. ``I have a lot of
confidence in them. That is why we stuck with the guys that got us
here.''
</P>
<P>
   Some feel Bochy pulled starter Kevin Brown too early in Game 1
as Donnie Wall came in with one out and two runners on in the
seventh to give up the long ball to Knoblauch.
</P>
<P>
   ``Donne Wall, he was the guy that we brought in that kind of
situation,'' Bochy said. ``That is what we wanted to do for this
series. Dan Miceli normally pitches the eighth inning and (Randy)
Myers is there to help him out depending on who is coming up. So I
still have confidence in these guys.''
</P>
<P>
   One of San Diego's problems is Miceli appears to have a dead
arm.
</P>
<P>
   ``He did have a little arm fatigue there in the Atlanta
series,'' Bochy said. ``So instead of breaking him out last night
in that situation, Donne, you know, had felt good all along, so we
went with Donne there. But Dan is fine to go.''
</P>
<P>
   But while the Padres bullpen continues to stumble, New York
relievers have almost been perfect, especially closer Mariano
Rivera, who know has four saves this postseason and has not allowed
a run in 10 1/3 innings.

 &HT;    'Raft to riches' Hernandez turns in outstanding performance
 &HT;    By Tim Tucker
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   New York _ A year ago, when his half-brother struck out 15
Atlanta Braves in the playoffs, then was MVP of the World Series,
Orlando Hernandez watched the games at the CNN studio in Havana.
Two months later, he fled Cuba in a makeshift raft, seeking freedom
and baseball.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday night, Orlando (El Duque) Hernandez landed in the World
Series.
</P>
<P>
   Raft to riches, someone called it.
</P>
<P>
   And despite the efforts of the Yankees' hitters to steal the
show, Hernandez was the best story of World Series Game 2. Heck, he
would have been the best story even if he hadn't pitched well and
gotten the win over San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   It is a mind-boggling journey, through shark-infested waters,
from an $8.75-a-month job as a physical therapist in a Cuban
psychiatric hospital to starting a World Series game. Not
surprisingly, a movie is in the works.
</P>
<P>
   On the day after Christmas, Hernandez and seven others snuck out
of Cuba. Three days later, they made it to the Caribbean island of
Anguilla Cay. And about two months later, Orlando Hernandez, who
had been banned from baseball in Cuba because he was suspected of
aiding half-brother Livan Hernandez's defection, got his first
benefit of capitalism: a three-year, $6.6-million contract with the
Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   And still he might not have been on the mound in this World
Series if David Cone hadn't been bitten on his pitching hand by his
mother's dog. . . .
</P>
<P>
   That part of this stranger-than-fiction story happened in June,
and Hernandez, who began the season in the minors, was called upon
to make one start for the Yankees. He pitched so well that he made
20 more regular-season starts, then pitched so well in the ALCS
that he got a World Series start ahead of Cone, who'll work Game 3.
</P>
<P>
   ''He seems to pitch his best when more things are at stake,''
Yankees manager Joe Torre says of Hernandez, and why does that not
surprise us? Torre again: ''After all he's been through the last 12
months, this is just a game.''
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's wasn't much of a game. The Yankees' hitters found Andy
Ashby a lot less troubling than Braves' hitters did, pounding him
for 10 hits and seven runs in 2 2/3 innings. Hernandez worked seven
innings, allowing six hits and one run, the only run he has allowed
in 14 innings this postseason.
</P>
<P>
   It would seem at the moment that this Series will be won easily
by the Yankees. But remember: The Braves won the first two games of
the '96 Series more handily (a combined 16-1) than the Yankees have
won the first two games this time. And you know how '96 turned out.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez has declined during this Series to discuss his
defection from Cuba, but clearly he marvels at his ride of the past
year. As his team celebrated the American League pennant last week,
he sat alone. ''My mind was racing back with thoughts of the past
year,'' he said later. ''Although at times I've felt this is a
dream, I am certain now that it is real.''
</P>
<P>
   And did he dare dream, while watching his brother beat the
Braves and Indians, that a year later he would find himself in the
same spotlight? ''No, I didn't think I would be here today,''
Orlando Hernandez said, ''but yes, I did think of finding a way to
one day be here.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Shortly after he took office in 1993, President
Clinton traveled to Silicon Valley to lay out his vision of a
robust U.S. economy buoyed by high-technology companies that could
compete anywhere in the world.
</P>
<P>
   The night before his speech, Clinton went out to dinner with two
dozen executives, some of whom complained bitterly about government
rules impeding the overseas sale of computers and other
cutting-edge technologies.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton grabbed a pad, furiously took notes, and promised
relief, one executive recalled.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next five years, the president delivered, personally
presiding over what industry executives and government officials
agree was one of the most sweeping relaxations of export
restrictions in U.S. history.
</P>
<P>
   ``These reforms,'' Clinton said in a 1993 letter detailing the
changes to a leading computer executive, ``can help unleash our
companies to compete successfully in the global market.''
</P>
<P>
   In the years that followed, the new rules helped Clinton fulfill
his vision of a centrist Democratic Party with close ties to U.S.
business. Grateful high-technology companies showered the
Democratic Party with campaign contributions, cementing a new
financial base for a party that has historically struggled to raise
money from corporate America.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials portray the initiatives as one of
Clinton's most lasting legacies, saying it bolstered national
security by helping to make the United States' economy the world's
strongest. The flood of new exports also created high-paying jobs
at home.
</P>
<P>
   But critics, including Republicans in Congress and some former
Clinton administration officials, argue that the high-technology
exports had a serious side effect, strengthening countries like
China, which some view as a potential adversary. Clinton, they
contend, was blinded by his enthusiasm for securing the United
States' global edge and insufficiently attentive to his policies'
effect on long-term U.S. national security.
</P>
<P>
   House and Senate committees are examining whether China took
advantage of the looser rules on exports to enhance its military
and to obtain technology that it passed on to rogue states,
including North Korea. The Senate Intelligence Committee and a
special House panel, which are scheduled to report their findings
in early 1999, have held a series of closed-door hearings this
fall.
</P>
<P>
   An examination by The New York Times of the administration's
export policies on China, based on interviews as well as government
and industry documents, shows that the looser regulations enabled
Chinese companies to obtain a wide range of sophisticated
technology, some of which has already been diverted to military
uses.
</P>
<P>
   The new rules allowed U.S. companies to sell a host of products
without prior government approval, from high-speed computers to
machine tools to communications gear previously subject to
restrictions during the Cold War. While the regulations fostered
trade, they made it much harder for intelligence agencies to track
how U.S. equipment was used overseas, administration officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   Until 1993, most sales to China of goods with possible military
uses required U.S. companies to obtain a government license naming
both the customer and the location in which the equipment would be
installed.
</P>
<P>
   Senior officials acknowledge that Clinton decided to change the
rules without a rigorous review by intelligence officials or other
national security experts.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, CIA analysts wrote a report warning of the military
implications of technology transfers to China, but it never became
an official assessment, because senior aides felt it was ``not well
done and lacked analytical depth,'' a U.S. official said.
</P>
<P>
   The government's last serious examination of technology sales to
China, they said, had been conducted by the Reagan administration
in 1984 at a time when the United States was trying to build up
China as a counterweight against the Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, the Soviet Union has collapsed. And China has been
caught selling missile equipment to nations like Iran and Pakistan
while using its new access to Western technology to expand its
economic and military power.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Wolfowitz, a former official in the State and Defense
departments who participated in the 1984 study, asserted that
international developments since then argue for a tightening of
controls on sales to China, not a loosening.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is an urgent need for a fundamental review of export
policy to China especially because China is in the process of
becoming _ albeit still quite slowly _ the major strategic
competitor and potential threat to the United States and its allies
in the first half of the next century,'' said Wolfowitz, who is
dean of the Paul H. Nitze School of Advanced International Studies
at Johns Hopkins University.
</P>
<P>
   But another China expert sees Beijing's improvement of its
technologically backward military as more benign.
</P>
<P>
   ``Its overall policy is not to be a troublemaker,'' said Doak
Barnett, a professor emeritus at Johns Hopkins, who added that
``gradually building up its defense establishment is something I
would expect it to do, but in my view it's not threatening.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever China's intentions, the Clinton administration over the
last five years has approved export to China of $3 billion in
technology with military or civilian applications, about 5 percent
of overall U.S. sales to China.
</P>
<P>
   A report prepared for the Commerce Department last December
concludes that the administration has little means of knowing
whether this equipment is harming U.S. national security or being
used by Chinese industries to challenge U.S. competitors and jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It may be too late by the time that U.S. industry and/or
government realize there is a problem emerging in either of these
areas,'' the confidential report says.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. intelligence agencies are trying to assess how much the
Chinese military has gained from the imports. Officials say they
have already concluded that China's army gained access to some of
the high-speed computers sold to civilian customers since 1996,
when the rules on computer exports were eased. The officials said
the agencies were unable to assess how the equipment was being
used, because they lacked basic information about the deals.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton administration officials said that the Chinese have
returned the one computer that was improperly diverted and that a
new agreement between the two countries will improve the ability of
U.S. officials to check the whereabouts of equipment exported to
China.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Christopher Cox, R-Calif., who heads the select House panel
on technology transfers to China, said, ``There's always been a
tension within the government about which exports are proper.''
</P>
<P>
   But, he added, ``these days without question the overriding
impulse to sell, sell, sell is in the ascendancy.''

<P>
   The Old System
</P>
<P>
   Cold War Rules Get New Scrutiny
</P>
<P>
   The United States and its Western allies zealously guarded their
technological edge during the Cold War, forbidding the sale to
communist-bloc nations of any item with a conceivable military use.
Military contractors did not chafe too much under the restrictions,
because the Pentagon had a seemingly limitless budget for their
wares.
</P>
<P>
   In 1983, Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping complained bitterly about
the restrictions on technology exports, prompting the Reagan
administration to ease some of the rules for China. It was seen in
the United States' interest, Wolfowitz recently told Congress, to
help Beijing develop the military muscle needed to counter the
``formidable threat'' from the Soviet Union. In addition, he said,
China had been helpful in arming the Afghan rebels.
</P>
<P>
   The United States, however, maintained tight controls over what
he termed the most sensitive technologies _ those that could
improve China's missiles or anti-submarine capabilities.
</P>
<P>
   The fall of communism brought a precipitous drop in the Pentagon
budget, prompting the defense industry to scramble for new markets.
Companies that once made spy satellites for U.S. spy agencies began
making equipment for cellular networks that served China or Russia.
</P>
<P>
   They quickly confronted a significant obstacle to making money
on sales to former adversaries. The Cold War-era rules remained
largely in effect, and they were being interpreted by career
officials who had devoted their lives to blocking exports to Russia
and its allies.
</P>
<P>
   Enter Bill Clinton. His 1992 campaign had been driven by the
slogan ``It's the economy, stupid.'' Aides say Clinton's views on
foreign policy were framed by his experiences as a governor of
Arkansas, a poor state that looked overseas for investments and
markets, and he arrived in Washington determined to expand trade.
</P>
<P>
   In an immediate sign of this policy's political importance,
Clinton sent the Democratic Party's chief fund-raiser, Ron Brown,
to take over the Commerce Department, which promotes U.S. exports.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon was traditionally the strongest voice against
technology exports, and Clinton made several appointments
calculated to change the culture.
</P>
<P>
   William Perry, an executive at a Silicon Valley company who was
vocally opposed to the existing system of export controls, was
named deputy defense secretary and then defense secretary. John
Deutch, a professor with similar views, was named to a senior pos
at the Pentagon, and then became director of central intelligence.
</P>
<P>
   Perry, testifying at his confirmation hearing to be deputy
defense secretary, told senators in February 1993 that controlling
dual-use technology is ``a hopeless task.'' He continued, ``It only
interferes with our companies' ability to succeed internationally
if we try to impose all sorts of controls in that area.''
</P>
<P>
   Perry said ``we really need to bear down'' on controlling the
most critical components necessary to build weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton took a personal interest in the new policy. Shortly
after he returned from his foray to Silicon Valley, he spelled out
his intentions in a letter to Edward McCracken, the chief executive
officer of computer maker Silicon Graphics. Company officials had
complained to Clinton over dinner about export rules.
</P>
<P>
   ``One reason I ran for president was to tailor export controls
to the realization of a post-Cold War world,'' Clinton wrote.
</P>
<P>
   After noting the need to retain strong controls in some areas to
combat the spread of nuclear, chemical and biological weapons,
Clinton detailed his intention to ``unleash our companies to
compete successfully in the global market.'' The United States, he
said, would slash red tape and loosen controls on the overseas sale
of computers, telecommunication equipment and machine-making tools.
</P>
<P>
   The New System
</P>
<P>
   Relaxed Rules Benefit Chinese
</P>
<P>
   Those restrictions were an integral part of the Cold War. For
decades, every proposed export of technology was weighed by a
committee of Western nations. It had authority to block sales
involving military hardware or so-called ``dual-use'' equipment
that had military or civilian applications.
</P>
<P>
   Even before the committee disbanded in 1994, the Clinton
administration moved to ease restrictions on the sales of many
dual-use items. The new rules allowed companies to export many
categories of technology without applying for a government license.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. companies were delighted with the new system, which
relieved them of a time-consuming and frustrating process. But the
benefits came with a cost. Because sales could be made without
export licenses, the government and its intelligence agencies no
longer had a record of many deals that involved dual-use equipment.
There was no way to trace patterns of sales _ to know, for example,
how many decoding devices were being sold to a particular country.
</P>
<P>
   Commerce Department internal documents show that China has been
a major beneficiary of this policy. According to a 1995 estimate,
more than $1.9 billion in annual trade with China had been removed
from federal scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
   A ban remains in effect on the sale to China of the most
militarily potent technologies, like ballistic missiles, spy
satellites and advanced fighter aircraft. Beijing buys those
weapons from Russia, Europe and Israel.
</P>
<P>
   ``China has benefited more than any other country from U.S.
decontrols on certain dual-use commodities enacted in late 1993 and
early 1994,'' one Commerce Department document says. ``There has
been a 60 percent decrease in the number of individual export
licenses required for trade with China (from 2,229 in 1993 to only
925 in 1994).''
</P>
<P>
   The rules shifted much of the burden for controlling exports to
the companies making the deals.
</P>
<P>
   Previously, the applications for licenses to sell sophisticated
electronic equipment overseas were scrutinized by Pentagon and
intelligence analysts. One crucial question was whether the
customer was really a ``front'' for military users barred from
buying such equipment.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration's new policy relied on industry
executives to raise questions about their own sales. They were
required to seek a Commerce Department license only if they
believed the equipment would end up in military hands.
</P>
<P>
   Aerospace officials say they are ill equipped to make such
evaluations.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the administration began making public the names of
questionable customers, to warn exporters. But industry officials
said the list of about a dozen nuclear-production facilities was a
tiny slice of what was available and ignored entities involved in
missile activity.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is particularly acute, industry executives said,
when the deals involved China, where the military has long played a
role in commercial ventures and where it is difficult to
distinguish between military officers' personal and professional
dealings.
</P>
<P>
   One of the first deals under the new rules, a 1994 sale of
telecommunications equipment to China, illustrates the
complexities. The Commerce Department's decision to allow such
exports without a license made it easier for AT&AMP;T and other U.S.
companies to sell hundreds of millions of dollars in sophisticated
equipment to Chinese companies building civil telecommunication
networks.
</P>
<P>
   An examination of the deal by the General Accounting Office, the
audit arm of Congress, found that the equipment was sold to a
Chinese-U.S. joint venture, Hua Mei, ``without Commerce review,
even though the company was partially controlled by several
high-level members of the Chinese military.''
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T officials in turn told the audit agency that ``they did not
ask the Commerce Department to determine if Hua Mei was a civil end
user, nor were they required to.''
</P>
<P>
   It is not known whether the company has put the equipment to
military use. But Pentagon officials told the GAO that in 1994,
China's army was seeking to buy this same type of technology, as it
moved to improve its communications networks.
</P>
<P>
   The Reassessment
</P>
<P>
   A Computer Sale Sets Off Alarms
</P>
<P>
   By 1995, the Pentagon was urging Congress to look more closely
at export policy. Military officials noted that the effect of
technology was cumulative, and that while individual sales might
appear benign, a combination of cutting-edge acquisitions would
allow an adversary to build much better bombs or radars.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, documents show, was moving in the opposite direction.
</P>
<P>
   According to a 1995 Commerce Department document, the president
``made clear,'' in private conversations he had with Brown, that
``he does not believe we have done enough to streamline and
liberalize.''
</P>
<P>
   The document mapped out how Brown should lobby high-level
administration officials to ease controls on computer exports and
shift items like communications satellites, engine technology and
commercial data-scrambling devices. Such items were on a list of
equipment that required a State Department license, and companies
believed they could close more deals if authority over the exports
were moved to Brown's Commerce Department.
</P>
<P>
   Their enthusiasm for the Commerce Department was well grounded.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to proposed sales of an item regulated by the
State Department, the Pentagon holds a virtual veto, a privilege it
exercised regularly during the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
   The Commerce Department is responsible for promoting U.S.
exports. When it weighs an overseas deal, the Pentagon has only one
vote out of five agencies, and the right to appeal if its
objections are overruled, which has been rarely used.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Warren Christopher insisted that his
department retain jurisdiction. He was overruled in early 1996 by
Clinton, opening the way to billions of dollars of satellite sales
to Chinese companies.
</P>
<P>
   At about the same time, the administration was weighing whether
to lift restrictions on the export of some advanced computers.
Officials asked outside consultants to study the issue, and they
came back with a report that asserted the controls were pointless.
The powerful computers manufactured by U.S. companies would soon be
widely available from foreign competitors, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   The administration asked the consultants to assess whether
computer sales could pose a threat to the U.S. military. Their
report did not take a position, saying the government did not have
enough information to draw a conclusion.
</P>
<P>
   This left the issue to Clinton, who decided to fulfill his
pledge to the Silicon Valley executives and relax the restrictions.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president made a judgment on what the threat was, and the
president's judgment was reflected in his decision,'' said William
Reinsch, undersecretary of commerce for export administration. The
new rules took effect early in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after, Chinese companies bought 77 of the high-speed
computers, which can be used to predict weather patterns but can
also scramble secret communications or design powerful nuclear
weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Disclosure of those sales prompted Congress to reinstate license
requirements for some advanced computers.
</P>
<P>
   This year, the CIA and other federal agencies concluded that at
least some of those computers are now being used by China's
military. The details of their use remain unclear, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   A review by the GAO last month called into question the
administration's basic assumptions in lifting the controls on
computers. Contrary to what the consultants said in their report,
the international market for advanced computers remains strongly
dominated by U.S. companies.
</P>
<P>
   Congress acted after The New York Times reported that two U.S.
aerospace companies were under investigation to determine whether
they went too far in sharing rocket technology with Chinese
scientists seeking to determine the causes of a failed satellite
launch in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The inquiry, which continues, has since been broadened to
include a failed launch in 1995. Rocket technology for ballistic
missiles is similar to that used to send satellites into orbit.
Both companies have denied wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   Just this month, Congress reversed Clinton's 1996 decision and
returned satellite exports to the State Department. At the same
time, lawmakers created a new senior Pentagon position for
technology security after concluding that military officials' role
in controlling exports to countries like China had been
``significantly and improperly reduced over the years.''
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   The Fallout
</P>
<P>
   Report Cites a Loss of Oversight Role
</P>
<P>
   The military significance of the United States' exports to China
is hotly debated.
</P>
<P>
   China's army is in the throes of modernization. For now, Beijing
is more of a regional power than a global threat.
</P>
<P>
   A commission headed by former Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld
concluded in July that the looser controls on exports, coupled with
lax enforcement, had increased the possibility that rogue nations
like Iran or North Korea would build ballistic missiles that could
hit the United States.
</P>
<P>
   China ``poses a threat to the United States'' by supplying
technology to these pariah states, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   Commission members said they were startled at how much the
government had freed the export of dual-use technology and how
little U.S. officials could do to track its use or ensure that it
was not diverted to terrorists or foreign militaries.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's particularly troubling,'' said James Woolsey, a
commission member who was Clinton's first director of central
intelligence, ``is that the massive decontrol in the last few years
of the export of dual-use technology in general, and specifically
to China, has made it almost impossible for the U.S. to monitor
where such technology has gone, much less exercise any control over
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Another commission member, Barry Blechman, said technology
transfer ``is a central reason why we reached our conclusion.''

   Blechman is president of DFI International, the Washington
consulting firm that prepared a confidential report for the
Commerce Department in December on technology transfers to China.
</P>
<P>
   The report concludes that China does not currently pose a direct
threat to U.S. competitiveness in high technology. But it might in
the future, especially in areas like electronics, which by 1996 had
become China's top export back to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Then Clinton's policy might wind up being turned upside down,
with China jeopardizing the same high-paying jobs that Clinton used
to justify increasing exports to China.
</P>
<P>
   According to the report, the concern is that ``as Chinese
manufacturing becomes more sophisticated and technical in nature''
_ thanks in part to U.S. and Western exports of that technology _
``Chinese high-tech products could potentially undercut such
products (and therefore jobs as well.)''

confusing interpretations that leave the basic purpose and concepts

the Federal Trade Commission. Norris read an article in Byte

saw it, IBM and Microsoft were colluding to divide the
operating-system market -- a potential violation of antitrust law.

GORDON LIGHTS UP DAYTONA AND NEARS ANOTHER TITLE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Fla.)  (lb) 
 By TARIK EL-BASHIR   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTONA, Fla. _ The champagne is not on ice just yet, but it
certainly looks as if Jeff Gordon will soon be celebrating another
NASCAR Winston Cup championship, his second straight and third in
four years.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon took his 11th checkered flag this season and got his
first career victory in October on Saturday night in the Pepsi 400
at Daytona International Speedway, the first stock-car race under
the lights there. The victory gave Gordon a 358-point lead over
Mark Martin, who, with just three races left on the schedule, has
virtually no chance of catching him. Martin, driving a Ford,
finished 16th on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon, who has scored top-five finishes in each of the last
three restrictor-plate races, can, with a good run, clinch the
title next week at Phoenix. He needs to finish 32nd or better in
each of the final three races.
</P>
<P>
   ``Awesome! Awesome!'' Gordon's crew chief, Ray Evernham, shouted
over the radio as the No. 24 Dupont Monte Carlo hit the finish
line. ``Hey, Jeff, it's October, buddy, it's October.''
</P>
<P>
   To which Gordon replied: ``You better believe it. Yes it is. Yes
it is.''
</P>
<P>
   Gordon, who had 39 career victories before Saturday but had
become notorious for registering them before October, took the lead
for good with 37 laps remaining.
</P>
<P>
   The race was red-flagged because of rain with six laps to go and
ended under caution when a car spun on the final lap. Gordon
piloted his Chevy around the 2.5-mile, high-banked oval at an
average speed of 144.549 miles an hour.
</P>
<P>
   ``We figured that somebody would say this was actually a July
race that was run in October,'' Gordon said after winning his 40th.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday's race was originally scheduled for July 4, but raging
forest fires and smoke in the surrounding area forced its
postponement. The fires, which charred more than 30,000 acres, came
within one mile of the speedway.
</P>
<P>
   Bobby Labonte, who won the pole last Thursday, continued his
success in restrictor-plate races, driving his way back from
seventh place to take second. Mike Skinner was third.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought we were going to run on Gordon off Turn 4 there,''
Labonte said, referring to an inside move he made on the race
leader in the last lap. ``But I didn't get any help.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to being the first stock-car race under the lights
at Daytona, the race marked the first time in the series that
restrictor plates, which limit horsepower and thus speed, had been
used on the cars in consecutive weeks. (Talladega, the only other
track where cars are fitted with restrictor plates, was the site of
the previous weekend's race.)
</P>
<P>
   About the new lighting system at Daytona, Gordon said: ``The
lights were fantastic. I think they did a great job here. There was
no problem from the drivers' standpoint as far as shadows.''

COMMENTARY: LOOKING EASTWARD FROM THE RURAL WEST 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Colo., Mont.)  (js) 
 By VERLYN KLINKENBORG   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Traveling across the Western plains in late summer and early
fall, I seemed to be traveling across the landscape of a national
moment _ the protracted moment between President Clinton's apologia
in mid-August and the House of Representatives' early-October vote
to authorize an impeachment inquiry. I tried hard to let the news
in general and that news, specifically, slip away behind me like
the rough red pavement on the interstate. But no matter how far I
went, and no matter where I stopped _ at a small ranch in
Colorado's Bijou Basin or a large ranch along the East Rosebud
River in Montana _ the question, sooner or later, arose, ``What do
you think of this mess?''
</P>
<P>
   I was a carrier, of course, a vector, to use the language of
epidemiology. Strangers asked me where I came from and what I did,
and my answers made the question about ``our president'' _ a phrase
that can sustain a remarkable amount of irony _ inevitable. But
what I noticed was that in most conversations the question about
the Starr investigation and the president's conduct was only a
brief bypath leading to more complex questions, like the role of
Nafta and the growing anger over beef imports from Canada and
Argentina and their effect on cattle prices.
</P>
<P>
   This was not nearsightedness. Talking cattle prices is just an
especially terse way to talk politics, a language that makes the
entire Clinton-Lewinsky-Starr saga sound extravagantly adolescent.
You cannot make a living from the land for long if you do not think
carefully about how you allocate resources. ``Now is when you
irrigate for next year's hay,'' one rancher told me as we stood on
a Montana hilltop looking across a draw.
</P>
<P>
   Like most of the ranchers I have met, this man knows the value
of a solid fact. Like them, he also uses a lot of silence when he
talks. I often try to see things the way he sees them, even though
it means I have to read the space he sometimes leaves between his
thoughts. But the implication I drew from talking about this mess
with him, and with other rural men and women like him, was
unmistakable. The judgment you want to bring upon a neighbor you
bring upon yourself first, to see how it feels. You do not waste
scarce resources. You do  &QC; not blame other people if your children
do not know how to act or what to believe. And, after a hard day's
work in a world of solid, often immovable facts, you still have to
irrigate the pastures and hayfields for the year to come.

EDITORIAL: A RESCUE PLAN FOR THE EVERGLADES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Fla.)  (lb) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Monday, Oct. 19:
</P>
<P>
   It has always been clear that the Clinton administration's
ambitious plan to save the Everglades would not succeed unless ways
could be found to guarantee this wondrous ecosystem a reliable flow
of fresh water.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the Army Corps of Engineers unveiled a breathtaking
plan to do exactly that. The plan has already won the support of
environmentalists. It also needs support from less reliable but
nevertheless indispensable stakeholders _ Congress, Florida's
political establishment and the state's powerful and often
obstructive sugar interests.
</P>
<P>
   The Corps' commitment is a good omen, since the Corps did much
to damage the Everglades in the first place. Fifty years ago, under
orders from Congress, the Corps drained a half-million acres south
of Lake Okeechobee with a vast web of levees, canals and pumping
stations.
</P>
<P>
   This marvelous if misguided feat helped the sugar cane industry
and kept Florida's east coast free from floods and safe for
development. But it robbed the Everglades and Florida Bay of fresh
water and nearly ruined both.
</P>
<P>
   The plan's central purpose is to recapture 85 percent of the
fresh water that is now channeled out to sea during the wet season,
leaving the Everglades dry when the rains stop. Massive lagoons
would be built to store the water, canals would be destroyed to let
the water flow southward in a more natural way, and vast artificial
marshes would be created to filter pollution from cane fields and
the cities.
</P>
<P>
   The Everglades would not be the only beneficiary. The system
would also supply drinking water for South Florida's exploding
population.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, obstacles abound. Most of the restoration projects so
far have been paid for on a 50-50 basis by the state and the
federal government, as the new plan would be. One big question is
whether the Florida Legislature and its patrons in agriculture and
real-estate development will go along. Thousands of acres _ much of
it coveted by developers and growers _ must be acquired for water
storage and purification.
</P>
<P>
   With that in mind, the sugar industry persuaded its friends in
the Florida Legislature earlier this year to pass a bill that would
have given the Legislature line-by-line veto power over every
detail of the Corps' restoration plan.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Lawton Chiles courageously vetoed the bill, but the episode
raised doubts about the reliability of the Legislature in the year
ahead. There are also worries that Jeb Bush, the Republican who is
favored to succeed Chiles, may not be as firmly wedded to
Everglades restoration.
</P>
<P>
   Another potential obstacle is Congress. This year, various House
appropriations committees denied the Interior Department some of
the money it needed to acquire crucial buffer zones between the
Everglades and Florida's populated east coast, and shortchanged the
Corps as well. Republicans leaders said Florida's unreliability as
a partner had discouraged their colleagues from approving more.
</P>
<P>
   That is a poor excuse. Time and again, Congress has committed
itself to undo its disastrous mistakes of 50 years ago, when it
robbed South Florida of its historic water flows. It is duty bound
to honor that commitment now.

FORMER STUDENT FACES TRIAL IN '97 SLAYING 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By DAVID ROHDE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Opening arguments are to begin Monday in the trial of
Corey Arthur, a 20-year-old accused of torturing and killing his
former English teacher, Jonathan Levin, for his banking card.
</P>
<P>
   The slaying in May 1997 unnerved the city in an era of declining
crime, and turned a little-known schoolteacher into a symbol of
public service. Levin, 31, the son of Gerald M. Levin, chairman of
Time Warner, had quit a corporate career in travel insurance to
become a teacher at William Howard Taft High School in the Bronx.
</P>
<P>
   He was so popular with his students that some of them displayed
a sign declaring ``We are his kids'' at his funeral. His death in
his Upper West Side apartment, after he had let in the former
student, led some teachers to question how accessible they should
be to their students.
</P>
<P>
   Court papers and statements by investigators suggest that two
pictures of the slaying, both troubling, are likely to emerge
during the first-degree murder trial in state Supreme Court in
Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Law enforcement officials have portrayed Levin's death as the
result of a crudely bungled robbery carried out by Arthur and
26-year-old Montoun Hart, who is being tried separately on a charge
of second-degree murder. Hart has told the police that Arthur fired
the fatal shot.
</P>
<P>
   In statements made to the police after his arrest, Arthur
proclaimed his innocence and said he had gone to Levin's apartment
to sell him crack cocaine. Arthur said two unidentified men killed
Levin after entering the apartment and forcing him to tie up the
teacher. Arthur managed to escape before the killing occurred, he
told the police.
</P>
<P>
   Arthur's account appears to conflict with the portrait of Levin
painted by friends, colleagues and former students _ that of a
dedicated teacher who traded a life of privilege for a classroom in
a Bronx high school with a four-year graduation rate of roughly 30
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Former students praised Levin as a teacher with a rare ability
to improve students' self-respect and self-esteem. He gave them his
home phone number, invited students to his Upper West Side
apartment, took calls from and visited students in jail, and
rewarded academic performance with dinners and trips to Yankee
games. He did not start telling students that he was the son of the
chairman of one of the largest companies in the world until shortly
before his death.
</P>
<P>
   He had been Arthur's English teacher as a part-time instructor
during the 1993-94 school year, and the student's mother, Penny
Bostick, told reporters last year that her son had liked Levin and
often spoke about him at home.
</P>
<P>
   But in the spring and summer of 1994, Arthur was arrested three
times on drug charges, including possession of heroin and selling
crack. After he was paroled in 1995, he seemed to have new resolve,
and earned a high school equivalency diploma. He started taking
classes at Bronx Community College, but dropped out after one
semester.
</P>
<P>
   Levin, meanwhile, had achieved his goal. He received his
master's degree in education from New York University, and was
hired as a full-time teacher at Taft in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   What brought Arthur to Levin's apartment on Friday, May 30,
1997, lies at the center of the trial. Arthur told the police that
Levin paged him and asked him to bring crack cocaine. But law
enforcement officials have said Arthur took advantage of his former
teacher's openness to get in the apartment.
</P>
<P>
   Levin was tied up with electrical tape and repeatedly slashed in
the chest and throat until he apparently revealed the user code for
his computerized banking card. At 5:15 p.m. that Friday, an
unidentified man was seen on a fuzzy surveillance tape using
Levin's card to withdraw $800 from a nearby automated bank machine.
</P>
<P>
   When Levin failed to appear at school on Monday morning, the
police entered his apartment and found him dead, killed by a
.22-caliber bullet behind his right ear. A partial message from
Arthur was on Levin's answering machine, and Arthur's fingerprint
was found on the tape used to tie the teacher up.
</P>
<P>
   Eight days later, Arthur and Hart were arrested after one of the
largest citywide police searches in recent years. Investigators
said Arthur, who was apparently not aware of Levin's background,
had bragged to friends about the killing and bought himself new $70
boots and $45 jeans afterward.
</P>

   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Nearly 17 months later, the Jonathan Levin Foundation, a
nonprofit organization established after the slaying, has created a
new media center and athletic field at the school. A nearby block
has been renamed Jonathan Levin Way.
</P>
<P>
   A faculty member at Taft said last week there were no plans to
mention the trial at the school. Levin's mother, who has attended
every pretrial hearing, and other family members are expected to
attend Monday's opening statements.
</P>
<P>
   The trial, which is expected to last five weeks, may clarify
what happened, but it is unlikely to explain it. Last year, letters
written by Levin's students were read at his funeral, including one
addressed to God: ``I write to ask why you took Jonathan away from
us,'' it said. ``He was an angel. We needed him here.''

L.A. SCHOOL SUPERINTENDENT HAS PLAN FOR IMPROVING PERFORMANCE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TERRI HARDY  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Dismal test scores. Poor student attendance. A
high dropout rate. Crowded classrooms. And too many uncredentialed
teachers.
</P>
<P>
   When Ruben Zacarias was named superintendent of the LAUSD a year
ago, he recognized the tremendous challenge of fixing one of the
most troubled school districts in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Now, in fits and starts, Zacarias is carrying out an
unprecedented plan to reform the beleaguered Los Angeles Unified
School District.
</P>
<P>
   He faces pressure from many sides: The mayor has vowed to unseat
the school board, the governor wants to establish penalties for
failing California schools and activists are seeking legislation to
split the district of 760 schools and centers.
</P>
<P>
   After a full year of sketchy details, the superintendent in
August finally mapped out clearer plans for the district's 100
lowest-performing schools. It stands as the only recent concrete
effort made by the system to reform itself. His obstacles include
opposition from the district's powerful unions and a resistance to
reform.
</P>
<P>
   Central to Zacarias' effort is a new word on the LAUSD's
vocabulary list: accountability.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's by far my biggest challenge,'' Zacarias said. ``The
culture of the public school system nationally, not just in Los
Angeles, has never included a sense of rewards or consequences
based on performance criteria.''
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as people feel the status quo is OK, what incentive do
they have to improve?'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Here is what he has done so far:
</P>
<P>
   -- Zacarias has identified the 100 worst-performing schools and
required them to devise an achievement plan. Support came through
tutoring and special after-school programs. Budgets at the schools
were reconfigured so a total of $10 million would be spent on the
extra programs at the 100 schools.
</P>
<P>
   -- A year later, schools that did not improve were put on
probation, and principals and teachers were told their jobs are in
jeopardy unless students do better.
</P>
<P>
   -- Zacarias plans to expand the accountability requirements to
all schools in the district. Without improvement, they would lose
local decision-making authority on budget, hiring and curriculum
matters. Further penalties include total reorganization, including
personnel changes.
</P>
<P>
   Zacarias' mantra is, ``Reform isn't about 100 schools, it's
about all schools.''
</P>
<P>
   State Superintendent Delaine Eastin said Zacarias is taking an
important first step, although she noted he has no choice but to
revamp the district.
</P>
<P>
   ``The district is in trouble, there's talk of breaking it up,''
Eastin said. ``Reform takes a while, but if you don't start, you'll
never get anywhere. I just hope he puts some real muscle behind
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Second-grader Gustavo Felix is at ground zero of the
superintendent's primary reform plan.
</P>
<P>
   About the time Zacarias took the helm of LAUSD, Gustavo's family
had arrived from Mexico and enrolled their son in second grade at
Cohasset Elementary School in Van Nuys. Gustavo couldn't draw with
the skill of a preschooler _ let alone read or write.
</P>
<P>
   ``He never had any regular education in Mexico,'' his
second-grade teacher explained.
</P>
<P>
   Gustavo, who will remain in second grade this year, isn't
unique. Cohasset teems with children who have difficulty reading
and writing in any language.
</P>
<P>
   This summer, teachers responded by providing intensive literacy
training to students like Gustavo, a strategy that educators hope
will jump-start children who come to Los Angeles schools ill
equipped to tackle basic subject matter.
</P>
<P>
   Zacarias contends that these schools, with enough motivation and
resources, can pull themselves out of their academic quagmire and
be a model for the rest of the district.
</P>
<P>
   The LAUSD consistently placed in the bottom third of the nation
on the recent Stanford 9 achievement test subjects including
reading, math and language.
</P>
<P>
   But in the year since Zacarias arrived, 68 schools, including
Cohasset, showed improvement on the exam.
</P>
<P>
   Still, movement forward comes slowly _ sometimes very slowly _
at the nation's second-largest school district.
</P>
<P>
   ``Change is crucial,'' Zacarias said. ``It isn't going to come
overnight, but I do believe we're pointed in the right direction.''
</P>
<P>
   (2nd take to follow)
</P>
<P>
   After identifying the 100 lowest-performing campuses, it took
Zacarias months to meet with the staff from the schools and
evaluate their achievement plans. Those talks finally ended in
December.
</P>
<P>
   Then, funds for tutoring and other remedial classes got to the
schools very late _ some campuses didn't get money until the
summer. That meant that the schools took the Stanford 9
standardized test _ the exam that serves as their chief measure of
improvement _ before they received extra support.
</P>
<P>
   And even despite the improvements shown at Cohasset and many of
the 100 schools, the superintendent will be the first to say that
the job is far from over.
</P>
<P>
   Cohasset students who took the Stanford 9 lagged behind 84
percent of their peers in the nation. Most schools are still
performing below the district's dismal reading averages.
</P>
<P>
   Teachers and administrators bridled at being among the very
publicly announced 100 schools. But some campuses are shrugging off
the stigma and instead are using the superintendent's edict as a
motivating force.
</P>
<P>
   And so it is in a gritty section of Van Nuys, where Cohasset
Elementary School stands cheerlessly, with an overgrown lawn and
drab exterior.
</P>
<P>
   But things inside a back bungalow are anything but drab, as
traditional music from Southwest American Indians drifts through a
classroom as two teachers in English direct eight children how to
make a model pueblo out of clay.
</P>
<P>
   Gustavo, that once-shy youngster with so few skills, leads the
group.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's made tremendous progress with this program. His motor
skills and verbal skills are already improving,'' said teacher
Lilly Valdivia. ``He was the first to attack this project, and now
he's teaching the others.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the summer, the school enrolled 150 more of its 750
students in a literacy and study skills course done largely on
computers. More than $43,000 was spent to train teachers by Kaplan
Learning Services. Also as part of its improvement plan, the school
launched an after-school effort that offered enrichment programs in
such subjects as art history, math and science.
</P>
<P>
   Something worked at the school. Test scores rose an impressive 9
percentile points.
</P>
<P>
   On the district's northeastern edge, Glenwood Elementary
</P>
<P>
   _ which saw an amazing 12 percentile increase in students' test
scores _ rearranged its budget to finance an intensive reading
tutoring program for 40 struggling third-graders, said Principal
Diane Agliam.
</P>
<P>
   The school has been promised more funds for this school year,
but so far, no check has been received. Even more doubtful is
whether there will be an expansion of the tutoring program.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've never been able to afford anything like this before, and
we have a sense that it's really working,'' Agliam said. ``We just
regret we can't provide it to more children.''
</P>
<P>
   The road to reform has been fraught with potholes. The teachers
union denounced Zacarias' plan as shallow and spur-of-the moment,
created without its input and without regard to its own desire for
an accountability plan that would have teachers review other
teachers at poor performing schools.
</P>
<P>
   Day Higuchi, president of United Teachers Los Angeles, warned
that Zacarias' plan would have to be negotiated with the union.
</P>
<P>
   And the leader of the Associated Administrators of Los Angeles
was upset that the plan seemed to focus sanctions on principals and
not teachers.
</P>
<P>
   It remains to be seen if the districtwide plan could proceed
without their support, although Zacarias has shrugged off that
notion, saying the school board is behind his efforts.
</P>
<P>
   In an endorsement of other reform movements already under way in
the district, Zacarias has called for all schools to adopt some
form of local decision-making that relies on teachers, parents and
principals.
</P>
<P>
   Schools would have more authority over budgets, hiring and
curriculum. But that power comes with a price _ schools will also
be held responsible for their students' performance.
</P>
<P>
   By Oct. 30, schools must declare which decision-making plan they
intend to adopt. However, training won't be fully implemented at
all schools until 2001.

A BITTER FIGHT FOR SENATE IS JUST POLITICS UPSTATE
</HEADLINE>
   (jw) 
 By SERGE SCHMEMANN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   This is the time of year in Cortland, N.Y., when leaves turn red
and gold and signs sprout on front lawns with the names of favored
candidates. This year's crop offers an instructive guide to the
neck-and-neck Senate race between the Republican incumbent, Alfonse
D'Amato, and his Democratic challenger, Rep. Charles Schumer.
</P>
<P>
   Neither one appears on a single lawn.
</P>
<P>
   That may not be unusual, given the adage that all politics is
local. In Cortland County, a lovely stretch of rolling hills and
pretty old towns south of Syracuse, the creation of a new judgeship
has fired a lively race between William Ames and Richard Van
Donsel, whose names alternate about evenly along the leaf-strewn
yards. When national politics comes up in conversations, it is
almost always about President Clinton's problems _ almost always
with a dollop of sympathy for the president and disdain for his
perceived tormentors.
</P>
<P>
   But if the key to victory in the Senate race lies in upstate
communities like this, it has not been found yet. D'Amato has the
advantage that most people here are registered Republicans and know
little about his opponent, while Schumer has the consolation that
Cortland voters regularly elect Democrats and do not particularly
like what they know of the incumbent.
</P>
<P>
   Even D'Amato's attempt to fan the old upstate-downstate rivalry
against Schumer is not generating much heat. From up here,
D'Amato's hometown, Hempstead, L.I., seems not much closer than
Schumer's Brooklyn constituency.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate race just has not caught on, said Bruce Hollenbeck,
who runs Hollenbeck Cider Mills on Route 392, just east of Virgil.
``Upstate is mostly Republican, so I think D'Amato is probably hard
to beat here. Schumer, I don't know the guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Hollenbeck's friend Sidney Greenberg, a lawyer who said he was
``closer to 87 than 86,'' said of the race: ``I know Schumer is a
good guy, but I can't point to anything he's done. D'Amato, in my
view, is just another politician, and I mean that in the pejorative
sense.''
</P>
<P>
   Kenneth DeMunn, who owns JTS Lumber Inc., said: ``D'Amato leaves
a very bad taste. Too much of the buddy system. Schumer looks like
a real nice politician, but then all politicians do. We don't know
what he's for. They both talk of good schools, low taxes, but
nobody's telling us how.''
</P>
<P>
   While D'Amato enjoys considerable name recognition after 18
years in the Senate, he must also put up with an image expressed in
terms like ``slippery'' or ``typical politician.'' Schumer is best
known here as the Democrat who beat Geraldine Ferraro in the
primary, and increasingly as the brunt of D'Amato's attack
advertisements. Both must contend with the public's tangible
irritation with all politics, brought on by the Clinton business.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't like either one of them,'' Irv Goodrich, a retired
math teacher at Cortland High School, said Sunday. ``D'Amato has
been in there long enough and should be investigated for all the
stunts he's pulled. I don't know much about Schumer, but I don't
think his record is that spectacular. He seems like he is strictly
a metropolitan New York person. I guess I'll be looking for the
lesser of two evils.''
</P>
<P>
   From the day the campaign began, D'Amato has flooded television
with ads like the one showing New York City Democrats turning into
sharks as they swim upstate, and he has hammered away at Schumer as
a wastrel liberal from Brooklyn. Schumer, who has unleashed
scathing attacks of his own, branding D'Amato as a liar and
extremist, has also played up the fact that his father lived in
Utica as a boy, and that he is at home all over the state. More
recently, the senator has attacked Schumer for missing votes in
Congress, a criticism that appears to resonate less here than the
upstate-downstate divide does.
</P>
<P>
   The political schism between the two parts of the state dates
back at least a century. Robert Spitzer, a professor of politics at
the State University of New York College at Cortland, said the
predominantly rural conservative upstaters have traditionally
perceived New York City and its suburbs as a greedy bastion of
liberalism, whose profligate welfare programs suck the hard-earned
dollars of the northern counties. The upstaters have also felt that
New Yorkers look on them, if at all, as hicks and throwbacks. Above
all, there is the sense that the small cities and rural hamlets
upstate are overshadowed by the vast wealth and population of
Greater New York.
</P>
<P>
   But the old stereotypes are coming undone. Despite a majority of
registered Republicans, the County Legislature here has long been
controlled by Democrats, while New York is now run by a tough
Republican mayor. More important, the flow of largess has reversed
and is going northward these days, as upstate has fallen on hard
times while New York City has enjoyed a boom.
</P>
<P>
   Cortland and its population of 48,000 have been especially hard
hit, a fact that figures in conversations and in the local paper,
The Cortland Standard, far more than politics.
</P>
<P>
   Unemployment is at 7.3 percent. Rubbermaid recently pulled out
of town, leaving Cortland residents grumbling that the company left
right after a decade of tax breaks expired. Smith Corona, which
once employed thousands, has all but closed up shop now that nobody
needs its typewriters anymore.
</P>
<P>
   But none of that has fully stilled the upstate-downstate
resentments, or their invocation in political campaigns. ``Is it
effective? Probably is, because candidates never pass up a chance
to use the argument,'' Greenberg said. ``They're always crying that
downstate is trying to impose its will on upstate.''
</P>
<P>
   But DeMunn was not convinced the theme would help D'Amato.
``He's viewed as a New Yorker, too. Hempstead is even farther from
upstate than Brooklyn,'' he said. ``They're all seen here as
sharks, as a group of people from New York City out to do you
harm.''
</P>
<P>
   Even those who do not resent the downstaters see a huge divide.
</P>
<P>
   Victor Siegle, who owns a software business, JobOrder, and heads
two regional economic development panels, knows that upstate
benefits from downstate prosperity. But the differences between the
regions are so profound, he argued, that the two probably should be
separated.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though we'd lose money, we'd be better off independent,
like Puerto Rico,'' he said. ``It's so frustrating to see powerful
forces run our lives.''
</P>

</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Siegle, who is Jewish, did not see anti-Semitic overtones in the
``sharks from Brooklyn'' image. In fact, he said, most people are
unaware that Schumer is Jewish.
</P>
<P>
   Spitzer said: ``The split is less pronounced than it was several
decades ago, but it's still very much a part of New York politics.
But if you look at the Senate race, D'Amato is under significant
handicaps. He's had three terms, and the third is traditionally the
critical election for U.S. senators. There's a general feeling that
D'Amato has worn out the welcome, a sense that it's time for
somebody else. On the other hand, Schumer is from downstate, from
Brooklyn, and still not that well known. His biggest problem is
getting known.''
</P>
<P>
   Attacking his opponent has always been D'Amato's main campaign
weapon, Spitzer said. ``It's often said that nastiness turns voters
off, but the fact is that negative campaigning is effective for the
most part,'' he said. ``But of course it's a double-edged sword.''
</P>
<P>
   The edge pointed at Schumer was allowing D'Amato to shape the
challenger's image. So Schumer's most urgent task, said Jeff
Stonecash, a political science professor at Syracuse University,
was to start shaping his own identity. ``Schumer is lost if the
incumbent takes the initiative to identify him.''
</P>
<P>
   The congressman's image here is certainly fuzzy. ``There's been
so much negative advertising that I don't really know what Schumer
stands for,'' Fred Jacobs, a retired Smith Corona worker, said
Sunday. ``D'Amato has been to Cortland several times when various
companies have been going out of business. He supports us even
though he hasn't been able to stop company closings.''
</P>
<P>
   John Nozynski said he knew what would bring out the vote. ``We'd
like to see someone represent us who is honorable, even-handed,
sensitive to our needs, and doesn't just talk on TV,'' he said,
expressing a nostalgia as poignant and noble as the grand Victorian
mansion that he maintains as curator of the ``1890 House'' museum
on Tompkins Street.
</P>
<P>
   The house was built by the first magnate of Cortland, Chester
Franklin Wickwire, whose wire factory once covered many acres. On a
trip to New York City, Wickwire espied the mansion that James
Bailey, of Barnum &AMP; Bailey fame, had just built himself, and
ordered the architect Samuel Burrage Reed to build him a replica in
Cortland.
</P>
<P>
   It is a stunning example of the heyday of Victoriana, and
Nozynski has painstakingly restored original wall patterns and
furniture. Among these relics of Cortland's proud roots, Nozynski
resisted the notion that upstaters would fall for something as
crass as a campaign of slurs. ``Please don't paint us as people who
would fall for that,'' he said. ``I think there's more to the minds
of New Yorkers than something as glib as that.''

   Hampel/Stefanides To Be Acquired
</P>
<P>
   The agency world is getting smaller again as another independent
shop is being acquired.
</P>
<P>
   Envoy Communications Group &UR;  &LR;  in Toronto, which owns the Canadian
agency Communique, is expanding to the United States by buying
Hampel/Stefanides &UR;  &LR;  in New York. Financial terms of the deal, to be
formally announced Monday, were not disclosed.
</P>
<P>
   Hampel/Stefanides, founded in 1993, will continue to operate as
an autonomous agency under that name. The present management team _
Larry Hampel, 39, president; and Dean Stefanides, 43, and Brian
Goodall, 50, co-creative directors _ will continue in those roles.
</P>
<P>
   Hampel/Stefanides has had ``many opportunities to do a deal,''
Goodall said, but selected Envoy because it offered clients access
to integrated marketing services like Web-site design.
</P>
<P>
   Hampel/Stefanides, which also has an office in San Francisco,
has 60 employees and billings estimated at $110 million from
clients like Aer Lingus. Envoy agencies have 175 employees and
billings estimated at $75 million (United States) from clients like
Adidas.  &QL;

   Heinz Chooses Burnett For Ketchup Account
</P>
<P>
   H.J. Heinz Co., as part of a renewed commitment to advertise its
grocery products, has selected Leo Burnett  &UR;  &LR; Co. in Chicago to
handle the consolidated worldwide brand duties for Heinz ketchup
and other condiments and sauces. Though billings on the account,
which had been divided among a dozen shops, were not disclosed,
they were estimated at $50 million.
</P>
<P>
   Casey Keller, vice president for meal enhancement at Heinz in
Pittsburgh, said the decision came after a five-week review that
had been narrowed to Burnett and one other finalist, the TBWA
Worldwide unit of Omnicom Group &UR;  &LR;  in New York.
</P>
<P>
   The victory is important for Burnett as the agency seeks to
regain momentum after some large account losses. Burnett had long
been Heinz's primary U.S. agency for brands like ketchup and
Star-Kist tuna, but resigned in 1994 after Heinz drastically cut
back ad spending.
</P>
<P>
   The Burnett teams handling the account will be based in Chicago
and London. Burnett adds the new assignment to Heinz accounts in
Europe and Latin America for products like seafood.  &QL;

L.A. DISTRICT DEMANDS MODELS OF GOVERNANCE
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- By the end of October, every LAUSD school must
adopt a model of governance that includes budget flexibility,
collaboration and local decision-making.
</P>
<P>
   The choices are:
</P>
<P>
   -- LEARN or school-based management. For either choice, schools
must hold a formal vote of teachers, parents, classified staff and
administrators. LEARN schools have more flexibility, but more votes
from each group are required to become a Los Angeles Educational
Alliance for Restructuring Now campus. For example, LEARN schools
are empowered to make hiring decisions, whereas school-based
management campuses must obtain a waiver to make certain employment
decisions.
</P>
<P>
   -- Charter schools. Becoming a charter campus is a more drastic
step because the schools are granted almost complete autonomy from
state and district guidelines. But becoming a charter school is a
time-consuming, complex process that includes providing a detailed
proposal of achievement goals and fiscal management plans. The
application must be approved by both the local and state boards of
education.
</P>
<P>
   -- Comprehensive School Reform Demonstration Program. Schools
can reorganize under this federal program, which places an emphasis
on basic academics and parental involvement. Each school will
receive at least $50,000 in federal funds.
</P>
<P>
   -- Schools can come up with their own reform design as long as
the plan is approved by the superintendent. &QL;

MAGNET SCHOOLS AN LAUSD SUCCESS STORY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TERRI HARDY  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- They are the gems of Los Angeles Unified School
District, possibly its greatest success: magnet schools.
</P>
<P>
   Magnets were created as a voluntary integration program, and
most must maintain a set mix of students that are predominantly
minorities. Because students do so well in these schools, magnets
have exploded in popularity, so much so that the LAUSD is adding 10
and using them as models for other campuses.
</P>
<P>
   If there is a secret to their success, it is that many magnet
schools specialize in specific subjects and course work, for gifted
students or those who want careers in math and science, law
enforcement, and medicine, among others.
</P>
<P>
   ``Children are treated as if they are special, and there is an
expectation of success,'' said John Liechty, assistant
superintendent for instruction. ``Put it together and you have a
potential for a winning combination.''
</P>
<P>
   On the recent Stanford 9 achievement test, the average scores
for magnet students in all grades bested the LAUSD averages in
traditional classrooms. And in most levels, magnet students
outperformed their peers nationally.
</P>
<P>
   Because of their proven track record, the programs are in great
demand: Last year, 70,000 students vied for 12,000 seats. District
officials say many parents believe if they can't get their child in
a magnet program, they don't want them in the LAUSD.
</P>
<P>
   So starting in 1999-2000, the district is adding 10 new
magnets.Caryn Young, whose youngest daughter attends Van Nuys
Performing Arts Magnet, welcomes the new campuses.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're overcrowded,'' said the San Fernando Valley mother,
who had two other children graduate from magnets. ``Parents want to
send their children to magnets. They want their kids in specialized
programs, classes that are intense, not wishy-washy like normal
schools.''
</P>
<P>
   Amy Stuart Wells, associate professor of educational policy for
the department of education at the University of California, Los
Angeles, said magnets usually attract veteran teachers and get
additional state and federal funds because they are an integration
program.
</P>
<P>
   ``Parents think that these schools are better, and it becomes a
self-fulfilling prophecy,'' Wells said.
</P>
<P>
   Some, like Wells, argue that magnets attract above-average
students who would perform as well in traditional classrooms.
Others counter that the schools offer a motivating, challenging
curriculum that may not be offered in mainstream courses.
</P>
<P>
   Superintendent Ruben Zacarias has recognized the district has
not done enough to educate its brightest children. By the end of
October, the LAUSD will open 11 centers for gifted and highly
gifted students modeled on techniques and curriculum in its most
successful magnet schools.
</P>
<P>
   With the creation of the advanced study centers, the district
hopes to expand the magnet concept throughout the district --
bypassing the complicated enrollment process of a magnet.
</P>
<P>
   Liechty said the centers will allow more children to attend
their neighborhood schools and stay off the bus, while their
parents are able to feel confident that their child is getting a
quality education.
</P>
<P>
   But Wells said it would be difficult to duplicate a magnet
program without all the additional state and federal funds. She
said a similar experiment in St. Louis schools didn't work.
</P>
<P>
   ``Magnets were always seen as better; the district became
stratified,'' she said. ``Educators in the centers were not as
committed, and the programs did not take off.''

GIVEN A CHANCE, BROWN RUNS WELL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Every week the UCLA coaches announce an offensive,
defensive and special-teams player of the game. Last week, one
choice appeared obvious: Freshman tailback DeShaun Foster had
powered for 118 yards and singlehandedly halted Arizona's
first-half momentum.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Bruins coach Bob Toledo named junior Keith Brown offensive
player of the game. Sure, Brown had gained 91 yards and scored two
fourth-quarter touchdowns. But they came after Foster had softened
the defense, after UCLA had taken command. Clearly, it was not a
performance-based decision. Toledo was more concerned with Brown's
head than his yards.
</P>
<P>
   ``The coaches have faith in me,'' Brown said. ``(Being player of
the game) was a great feeling. It made me think the coaches have
confidence in me. I've never had the feeling before.''
</P>
<P>
   So inspired, Brown rushed for a career-high 101 yards Saturday
against Oregon, 66 percent of UCLA's total. He did not run with his
usual shiftiness but with previously unseen determination and
power. ``He ran violently,'' offensive coordinator Al Borges said.
``And I don't know that he's done that before.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown has no choice, really. The competition is fierce, what
with Foster and Jermaine Lewis in his shadow. But Toledo knows
three tailbacks can dwindle to one with the twist of a knee _ or a
punch thrown at an off-campus party _ and catapult a role player
like Brown into the starting lineup.
</P>
<P>
   Like USC quarterback Carson Palmer, Foster has 3{ years (if he
stays in school) to earn every accolade imaginable. Why rush him
into the spotlight? Why not remain loyal to the veterans?
</P>
<P>
   As soon as Brown and Lewis believe the coaches have handed the
present to Foster, they'll disappear. They'll lose focus and
motivation. They'll become dead weight, and dead weigh won't run
for 101 yards against Oregon with Foster nursing a sprained knee
that might keep him out 2-3 weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Brown wasn't No. 2 UCLA's only hero Saturday in the
41-38 overtime victory, just one of the most visible.
</P>
<P>
   Receiver Danny Farmer had 40 percent of the Bruins' receptions
and two touchdowns. Linebacker Brendan Ayabadejo had two sacks in
overtime. (One UCLA observer called it a well-timed impersonation
of Junior Seau.) Defensive end Kenyon Coleman returned from a
2{-game absence to recover two fumbles. And quarterback Cade McNown
fought off the flu to further his Heisman Trophy candidacy with 395
yards and three touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   Brown's contributions might have been the most surprising
considering past performance. He rushed for 6 yards against Texas,
did not play against Houston (turf toe) and had 31 yards against
Washington State. But in UCLA's most important games, Arizona and
Oregon, he gained 192 yards.
</P>
<P>
   The Phoenix native credits his improvement to good health and
maternal advice. Until this season, Brown had suffered one injury
after another: knees, ankles, shoulder, even stomach. He missed the
Cotton Bowl with a bad knee and part of spring practice with food
poisoning.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was starting to look like I was injury-prone,'' he said. ``I
didn't want that to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   His mother, Joyce, suggested a diet based on juices and herbs,
which she said would strengthen his ligaments and tendons. So Brown
inhaled all the kale and collard greens he could find, beat the
turf toe in one week, and has prospered since.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mom knew. She just knew exactly what I needed to do,''
Brown said, smiling.
</P>
<P>
   Sound mind, sound body, and now the starting tailback job is his
to lose.

YANKEES CRUSH PADRES, 9-3, IN GAME 2 OF WORLD SERIES

<P>
   NEW YORK _ The San Diego Padres are the National League
champions, conquerors of their domain. Facing the New York Yankees
in the World Series, the Padres have looked an awful lot like
doormats. But then, so does every team the Yankees play.
</P>
<P>
   The post-season was supposed to provide the ultimate test of
greatness for the Yankees. Instead, they are treating the playoffs
and World Series like extra credit. They crushed San Diego, 9-3, in
Game 2 on Sunday night before 56,692 at Yankee Stadium, to take a
2-0 advantage in the four-of-seven-game series. Orlando Hernandez,
the defector from Cuba, allowed a run in seven innings, the only
run he has permitted in 14 innings in the post-season.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees and Padres will resume the series on Tuesday night
in San Diego, with no reason to believe that San Diego can mount a
comeback other than the fact that the Padres have shown up for the
first two games.
</P>
<P>
   The Padres are a mess. Sterling Hitchcock, who was scheduled to
start Game 3 against the Yankees' David Cone, had flu-like symptoms
and was losing his voice. Kevin Brown, the Game 1 starter, was
suffering from a sinus infection and a bruised shin. Andy Ashby
started on Sunday night without a voice and with a sore throat and
head cold, and he would leave the field with this pitching line:
two and two-thirds innings, 10 hits, 7 runs (4 earned), 1 walk and
1 strikeout.
</P>
<P>
   Everybody has looked bad against the Yankees this year. New York
lost its first three games in April, then began careering down the
mountain of the baseball season. The Yankees won 114 games in the
regular season, compiling a .704 winning percentage; they now have
an .818 winning percentage since the playoffs began, winning 9 of
11 _ a sweep of three games from Texas, four victories in six games
against Cleveland in the American League Championship Series and
two victories to open the World Series.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees have nearly doubled their opponents' run production
in the post-season, 54-30. Joe Torre, their manager, believes the
Yankees have won 123 games this year in large part because they
have respected all their opponents, taken all of them seriously.
They beat up the expansion Tampa Bay Devil Rays; now they are
beating up San Diego, and the Padres appear powerless against them.
</P>
<P>
   Padres Manager Bruce Bochy, knowing that left-handed batters hit
109 points higher than right-handed batters against Hernandez this
season, inserted the left-handed-hitting Greg Myers into his lineup
at catcher, Myers' first start since Sept. 17. But the move
backfired in the first inning, as the Yankees blitzed Ashby.
</P>
<P>
   Myers failed to catch a foul pop hit by the leadoff batter,
Chuck Knoblauch, who subsequently walked. Myers throws poorly, so
Knoblauch swiped second and established that the Yankees would run
aggressively. Knoblauch scored and Paul O'Neill reached first base
on third baseman Ken Caminiti's throwing error, and then O'Neill
broke for second on a ground ball back to the mound; if O'Neill had
not been running, the play might have led to an inning-ending
double play.
</P>
<P>
   But the rally continued, with successive hits by Chili Davis,
Tino Martinez and Scott Brosius, and the Yankees led, 3-0. Ashby,
nursing his cold and sore throat, needed quick innings. He needed a
chance to retreat to the clubhouse, to relax, catch his breath,
review the innings past and ahead.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees treated him the same way they treated Brown in Game
1, however, taking pitches, making Ashby work, wearing him down.
The Yankees sent 14 batters to the plate in the first two innings,
and only O'Neill swung at the first pitch, in each of his two
at-bats. Ashby had to throw 29 pitches to get through that first
inning, and he would need almost as many in the second.
</P>
<P>
   The rookie Ricky Ledee, who reached base in his first seven
plate appearances in this Series, led off the second inning with a
single and Knoblauch walked. Myers threw out Ledee at third on an
attempted double steal, but Derek Jeter hit a run-scoring single.
Two batters later, Bernie Williams leaned on Ashby, fouling off
three two-strike pitches; it was like watching a cat toy with a
beleaguered mouse.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Ashby threw a sinking fastball with his 50th pitch of
the night and Williams drove it into the right-field stands, a
two-run home run _ in what could be Williams' last game as a Yankee
at the Stadium. (Williams is eligible for free agency after this
season, and he will seriously entertain offers from other teams
that are expected to be higher than what the Yankees most likely
will bid.)
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees applied the coup de grace to Ashby in the third,
quickly, as they often did against pitchers from Minnesota, Kansas
City or Oakland. Martinez singled and Brosius ripped the second of
his three hits, and after Jorge Posada hit into a double play,
Ledee smacked a double down the left-field line. Bochy came out of
the San Diego dugout to get his pitcher.
</P>
<P>
   As baseball lore would have it, the 1927 Yankees _ heretofore
considered by many to be the greatest team of all time _ all but
defeated the Pittsburgh Pirates in the World Series when they took
pre-game batting practice. The burly sluggers Babe Ruth and Lou
Gehrig smashed monstrous wall-clearing drives as the Pirates,
diminutive in comparison, supposedly stood nearby and gawked,
psychologically beaten.
</P>
<P>
   Their expressions could not have been much different from that
smeared across Ashby's face after Bochy mercifully replaced him in
the third inning. Sweat poured down his pale angular cheekbones,
his mouth opened slightly, and Ashby shook his head, projecting
disbelief.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees led, 7-0, and Hernandez was in complete control,
throwing fastballs when it appeared the Padres were anticipating
his curveball, flipping changeups when San Diego batters were
thinking fastball. Only three times in the first six innings did a
Padres base runner reach scoring position.
</P>
<P>
   By the seventh inning, this felt nothing like a World Series
games and every bit like a midseason blowout against Detroit. Fans
departed early, those who stayed cheered the former Yankees catcher
Jim Leyritz when he was announced as a pinch-hitter, and Torre was
using the last innings to get work for his relievers, who gave up a
pair of eighth-inning runs.
</P>
<P>
   Not exactly a Fall Classic. To be precise, a classic that began
in spring and may well end in the next few days in San Diego.

`MAGIC' CHARMS WAY INTO TOP SPOT IN OPENING WEEKEND
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TERRI HARDY  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- ``Practical Magic'' cast a winning spell at the
nation's box office with an estimated $13.6 &UR;  &LR; million at 2,652
theaters from Friday through Sunday, studio sources said.
</P>
<P>
   The Warner Bros. release, with Sandra Bullock and Nicole Kidman
as New England sisters who inherit magical powers, performed in
line with industry expectations. The marketing took advantage of
Halloween's approach to lure customers during what is traditionally
a slow movie-going period.
</P>
<P>
   ``Warner Bros. has to be pleased because this was something of a
high-risk picture,'' said analyst Arthur Rockwell of Drake &AMP; Co.
``I think its star power and theme were enough to give it a
respectable opening.''
</P>
<P>
   `` &UR;  &LR; `Practical Magic' was able to draw in women and the date
crowd,'' said Robert Bucksbaum, president of the Reel Source
forecasting service.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Universal's ``Bride of Chucky'' finished a strong second with
an estimated $11.8 &UR;  &LR; million at 2,411 theaters as the horror-comedy,
the fourth in the Chucky series, benefited from a memorable
``Chucky gets lucky'' ad campaign, as well as the tie-in to the
Halloween season and the genre's ongoing appeal to teens and young
adults.
</P>
<P>
   ``Halloween is definitely on people's minds at this time of
year,'' Bucksbaum said.
</P>
<P>
   Moviegoers continued marching to see ``Antz.'' The
computer-animated comedy came in a close third with $11.3 &UR;  &LR; million
at 2,903 sites in its third weekend, dropping only 23 percent from
its previous Friday through Sunday. The DreamWorks SKG release has
drawn $51.6 &UR;  &LR; million in 17 days after setting a record for an
October debut and soon will top the $63 &UR;  &LR; million record set by
``Beavis and Butt-head'' as the top non-Disney animated film.
</P>
<P>
   The success of ``Antz'' may wind up helping Disney's ``A Bug's
Life,'' another computer-animated comedy, scheduled for release
Nov. 20. Audiences appear to be responding well to trailers for ``A
Bug's Life'' when they run before screenings of ``Antz.''
</P>
<P>
   The weekend's other major opening, Disney's much-anticipated
roll-out of ``Beloved,'' finished fourth with a less-than-expected
$8.2 &UR;  &LR; million at 1,501 theaters. Bucksbaum pointed out that the
drama, starring Oprah Winfrey as a runaway slave, was unable to
draw a broad-based audience beyond women, despite strong reviews
and an extensive marketing campaign.
</P>
<P>
   `` &UR;  &LR; `Beloved' was not able to cross over to men,'' the analyst
said, also noting that the film's running time of nearly three
hours limits the number of daily showings. ``We still think it's
such a strong film that it will get an Academy Award Best Picture
nomination and it will take in about $80 &UR;  &LR; million. It's going to
take awhile, though.''
</P>
<P>
   Winfrey, one of the producers on the film, acquired the rights
to Toni Morrison's novel and made many appearances to promote the
movie.
</P>
<P>
   Holdover films took the remaining top 10 slots, led by New
Line's fifth weekend of ``Rush Hour'' with $7.8 &UR;  &LR; million at 2,724
theaters to eclipse the $109 &UR;  &LR; million mark and underscore the hit
comedy's profitability, given its $35 &UR;  &LR; million price tag.
PolyGram's third weekend of ``What Dreams May Come'' was next with
$6.5 &UR;  &LR; million at 2,506 sites to push its 24-day take to
$41.2 &UR;  &LR; million _ far short of the spiritual drama's $90 &UR;  &LR; million
budget.
</P>
<P>
   Paramount's third weekend of ``A Night at the Roxbury'' finished
seventh with $3.9 &UR;  &LR; million at 2,169 theaters. Next came Sony's
fourth weekend of ``Urban Legend'' with $2.9 &UR;  &LR; million at 2,063
screens, MGM's fourth weekend of ``Ronin'' with $2.7 &UR;  &LR; million at
1,982 locations and Disney's second weekend of Eddie Murphy's
``Holy Man'' with a disappointing $2.4 &UR;  &LR; million at 2,013 theaters.
``Holy Man'' generated less than half its opening weekend audience,
and the $60 &UR;  &LR; million project is certain to generate hefty amounts
of red ink.
</P>
<P>
   Coming in a still-strong 11th was ``There's Something About
Mary'' with $2.9 &UR;  &LR; million at 1,405 theaters in its first finish
outside the top 10 after 14 weekends. The comedy's 96-day total has
hit $164.8 &UR;  &LR; million for 20th Century Fox, making it the
48th-highest domestic grosser ever, placing just after ``The
Exorcist.''
</P>
<P>
   DreamWorks' 12th weekend of ``Saving Private Ryan'' drew
$1 &UR;  &LR; million at 851 screens, raising its total to $187.8 &UR;  &LR; million,
28th-highest domestic gross after ``Toy Story.''
</P>
<P>
   Overall, business continued to defy the season's traditional
slowdown in moviegoing. The three-day gross of about $80 &UR;  &LR; million
was up 10 percent from the same weekend last year. Year-to-date
business has reached $5.3 &UR;  &LR; billion, 12 percent ahead of the same
period last year.
</P>
<P>
   Studios will release more high-profile movies next weekend,
including New Line's comedy ``Pleasantville,'' Warner's Kurt
Russell action-drama ``Soldier'' and Sony's thriller ``Apt Pupil.''
Bucksbaum said ``Pleasantville,'' in which two modern-day teens
wind up in a 1950s sitcom, has the strongest prospects.
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, Miramax will go nationwide with ``The Mighty,''
and the family drama could break out because of high
audience-approval ratings. Second-weekend grosses were moderate
with $370,000 at 129 sites.

LAPD RANKS NO. 1 WITH FASHION POLICE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LEE CONDON  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Hollywood celebrities typically top the lists of
the best dressed, but the Los Angeles police proved Sunday that
their officers also set national fashion trends.
</P>
<P>
   Police Chief Bernard C. Parks, included earlier this year on
People magazine's most-beautiful people list, accepted an award
from the National Association of Uniform Manufacturers for having
the best-dressed force in the country among law enforcement
agencies with more than 200 members.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our uniforms project the legendary image of our department,''
said Parks in a written statement.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one can appreciate the pride we feel when we wear the
uniform of the Los Angeles Police Department,'' said Parks, who
received the award while attending a national conference of police
chiefs in Salt Lake City.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Richard Riordan applauded the LAPD's accomplishment,
saying, ``It gives people confidence and pride in themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   But Riordan also joked that LAPD officers certainly must stand
out in Los Angeles, a city that he contends needs some fashion
tutoring.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's ironic because we are one of the worst-dressed cities in
the world. People are so casual,'' Riordan said. ``Los Angeles
probably has the worst-dressed people in the world, starting with
their mayor.''
</P>
<P>
   The purpose of the award is to honor police departments that
have gone ``above and beyond the call of duty'' in uniform
standards, said Bernard J. Lepper, executive director of the
association. Entrants are judged on neatness, projection of
authority, practicality and adherence to uniform regulations.
</P>
<P>
   ``A uniform is the first thing people notice about a police
officer,'' Lepper said in a written statement. ``A clean, neat and
well-tailored uniform not only looks better but also commands
respect and encourages public confidence in law enforcement.''
</P>
<P>
   Sgt. Dan Mastro said officers are strongly encouraged to look
their best while on the job and are even told their shoes need to
be ``spit-shine'' clean.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you have someone who looks like a slob, how impressive is
that going to be if we handle your radio call?'' Mastro said.
</P>
<P>
   Mastro actually investigated the issue of uniforms a few years
back when he worked as a department representative advising Mattel,
when the toy giant was considering how to design clothes for a
police version of Barbie and Ken.
</P>
<P>
   Mastro said he found out that about 75 percent of the police
departments in the nation wear an outfit quite similar to the
simple dark blue uniforms worn by the LAPD.
</P>
<P>
   He also pointed out that like celebrities, LAPD officers have to
look their best since they are frequently on television because of
all the police-related reality shows.
</P>
<P>
   ``The LAPD television show is one of the most popular shows in
the world,'' Mastro said. ``What we do goes everywhere. We're it.
We're state of the art.''
</P>
<P>
   Sgt. Roger Archambault said Parks has had an impact on uniform
policy since becoming chief, asking that police in administrative
jobs, especially those working at Parker Center, wear uniforms
rather than business attire.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's easier than having to go out and buy a bunch of suits
anyhow,'' Archambault said.
</P>
<P>
   LAPD has won uniform awards before, and Archambault said he
believes it is because the clothes are so simple.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our uniforms look a little better. In Chicago, they have these
funny checkerboard hats. They look like cab drivers,'' Archambault
said.
</P>
<P>
   Sgt. Frank Sobisky of the Los Angeles County Sheriff's
Department acknowledged that the LAPD's dark uniforms look sharp
but said he likes the Sheriff's Department's khaki shirt and olive
green pants just as much, if not more.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to love the Marines to love our uniform, because it
looks so much like a Marine uniform,'' Sobisky said.
</P>
<P>
   He also likes simplicity in a police officer's uniform.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you watch some of those `Cops' shows, some of them are
god-awful ugly. I don't like it when they start putting stripes all
over them,'' Sobisky said.

<P>
   &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
CHICAGO _ Richie Cunningham accounted for most of the offense. It
looked like Potsie accounted for everything else.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, how the Dallas Cowboys long for the happy days of showing up
for games like Sunday's against the pitifully poor Chicago Bears
and knowing that somehow, some way they would find a way to stomp
the meek pretenders.
</P>
<P>
   But those days are gone. The meek inherited a 13-12 win at
Soldier Field. The Cowboys celebrated their upcoming ``open date''
one week early.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my mind, I think we're still the better team,'' Cowboys
running back Emmitt Smith said afterward. ``It just didn't show.''
</P>
<P>
   That might be the whole problem. The Cowboys still think they
are the Cowboys. You could see it in their strut. You could hear it
in their words, even after the loss.
</P>
<P>
   ``We played to the level of our opponent,'' cornerback Deion
Sanders said.
</P>
<P>
   But maybe they didn't play down. Maybe this is where the 'Boys
belonged. Clearly, it was a game that left the Cowboys wind-whipped
and shaken. It was bad professional football virtually from the
start, with so many mental mistakes, bobbles, turnovers, missed
assignments and silly penalties.
</P>
<P>
   It raised several questions, but none more obvious than this
one: Exactly which one of these teams has been a pretender through
the first seven weeks of the season?
</P>
<P>
   After all, the Bears, a meager 1-5 coming in, willingly admitted
to their shortcomings since the preseason. They knew they were bad
and tried to make the most of it, which in its own way seems
dignified.
</P>
<P>
   But until an eight-turnover debacle last weekend against the
Cardinals, the Very Bad Bears played the way very bad teams should
play _ with heart and determination, making the most out of a
little.
</P>
<P>
   They lost a one-point heartbreaker to Jacksonville. They lost by
four points to Pittsburgh, three to mighty Minnesota, and even beat
the Detroit Lions 31-27.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know we have a lot to work on, but it's so much fun to
coach a team that wants to come out and play hard every week,''
Chicago coach Dave Wannstedt said.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys, on the other hand, pretended to be close to the
same squad that dominated the league back in the happy days, not
the 6-10 team of a year ago. Until Sunday, they nearly had us all
convinced.
</P>
<P>
   The 4-2 record Dallas carried into Sunday's game looked certain
to be on its way to 5-2 against the Very Bad Bears. People actually
were talking about the Cowboys going 11-5 or even 12-4.
</P>
<P>
   But Sunday's effort only showed that the days of banking on
Smith's blasting through defenses when the game is on the line are
numbered. The days of Michael Irvin snagging everything in sight _
especially crucial third-down tosses right between his hands _
suddenly seem to be fading.
</P>
<P>
   The days of Troy Aikman wearing something other than civilian
clothes cannot come soon enough. And more than anything, the
Cowboys' secondary is either in big trouble or Wannstedt's new
nickname soon will be ``Air Dave.''
</P>
<P>
   If Bears quarterback Erik Kramer can hit seven receivers and
blister the Cowboys for 233 yards _ 116 on the Bears' final two
decisive drives _ imagine what the Vikings, Cris Carter and Randy
Moss and Co., will do in a few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have not arrived, which is obvious,'' Cowboys coach Chan
Gailey said.
</P>
<P>
   A week ago, the Cowboys talked about having lots of heart in
pulling out a close game against winless Carolina. And indeed,
there was no denying big contributions from several veterans,
especially Sanders.
</P>
<P>
   But it might all have been a case of the Cowboys playing
pretend, or at least relying heavily on the incomparable Sanders
pulling them to victory.
</P>
<P>
   A week ago, Sanders saved the game with a late interception.
Before that, he almost single-handedly won a Monday-night game
against the Giants.
</P>
<P>
   But on Sunday, the Bears successfully took Sanders out of the
game. He touched the ball only twice on punt returns for one yard.
When he played on offense, the Cowboys threw in Sanders' direction
just twice, unsuccessfully both times. And when Sanders was on
defense, Kramer threw only token short routes in front of him.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's probably the best cornerback there's ever been,'' Kramer
said. ``We weren't going to test him.''
</P>
<P>
   The Very Bad Bears at least were smart. It only led to the
Cowboys' performance looking more dismal.
</P>
<P>
   Smith was still solid, sure. He slipped through cracks in the
line for 78 yards. But when a win was a mere clock-killing drive
away, Smith was slammed back, and Gailey turned to the passing
game.
</P>
<P>
   Which only brought to light a more vital question: Is something
wrong with Irvin?
</P>
<P>
   Like Smith, Irvin is having a good season statistically _ 33
catches for 516 yards going into Sunday. But Ernie Mills and even
Billy Davis have higher per-catch averages than Irvin's 15.6, and
Irvin still is looking to score his first touchdown of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, when the Cowboys faced third-and-nine with the game on
the line late in the fourth quarter, quarterback Jason Garrett hit
Irvin on a crossing route. The ball slipped through Irvin's hands.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Kevin Smith, the embattled cornerback opposite
Sanders, was consistently scorched, giving up eight of the 18
completions Kramer had.
</P>
<P>
   This Cowboys team entered the day with a familiar strut but
ended it with Gailey proclaiming, ``I don't know where we are right
now.''
</P>
<P>
   It's certainly not happy days.

PETER LYNCH WANTS STOCKPICKERS TO KNOW WHAT THEY'RE BUYING
</HEADLINE>
  By MARK VEVERKA 
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
Do you know what you're invested in?
<TEXT>
<P>
   And I don't mean the names of the mutual funds or individual
stocks that you own. Nor the allocation mix of your portfolio.
</P>
<P>
   Do you really thoroughly understand enough about the companies
and funds on which your retirement depends?
</P>
<P>
   That's the question Hall of Fame stockpicker Peter Lynch
suggests that you ask yourself _ endlessly.
</P>
<P>
   `If (investors) can't explain their investments to their
11-year-old or their spouse ... that's pretty scary,'' says Lynch,
vice-chairman of Boston's Fidelity Management &AMP; Research.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Lynch was portfolio manager of the Fidelity Magellan
Fund, which was the premier fund under his leadership from May 1977
to May 1990. During his reign, the funds' assets swelled from $20
million to $14 billion.
</P>
<P>
   In today's celebrity-driven culture, Lynch is a financial star.
Not more than a few minutes after he and his white-frock of hair
entered the lobby of the Hilton Hotel near Union Square, an admirer
stopped to ask him for an autograph. He obliged without hesitation.
</P>
<P>
   Like Omaha's Warren Buffet, Lynch has his legions of fans (you
know who you are), who practice his ``invest-in-what-you-know''
philosophy over the long term. And it's volatile times like these
that test the master's patience with the unconverted. When asked
what he thinks of this topsy-turvy market, he somewhat
exasperatingly replies: ``It's the same today that it was a year
ago, five years ago and 25 years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Translation: The day-to-day machinations of the stock market
should have little bearing on your long-term investments (which
should be most of your portfolio). Asking how interest rate cuts
might affect your stocks is like ``skiing on a double-diamond slope
and wondering if it's windy,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Investors ``are better off owning one or two stocks and knowing
them cold, (and they) should stop watching CNN all day,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   ``It shouldn't be this buyers-versus-sellers crap.''
</P>
<P>
   If Lynch sounds a little punchy, it's because he's confounded by
the throngs of people who aren't spending sufficient time with
their portfolios (not to mention he was in the midst of a hectic
four-speech swing).
</P>
<P>
   What troubles him most are people who invest in companies
without knowing what they specifically manufacture or what they do,
who their customers are, what raw materials they rely on, and so
on.
</P>
<P>
   In short, too many folks are playing stock tips like they were
trotters at the track. ``That's gambling, not investing,'' he says.
``I don't know if they're calling the psychic hotline or what'' for
some of their stock selections, he adds.
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, everyone and their brother wants to know when the Dow
Jones industrial average will find a bottom, and if the recent
upswing is a sign that the worst is over. But Lynch doesn't bite.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been trying to buy a subscription to next year's Wall
Street Journal for the past 25 years,'' he quips.
</P>
<P>
   Seriously, Lynch is willing to address specific questions about
market cycles, volatility, psychology and corrections. You can
check out his answers on a Fidelity Web site. (Fidelity.com will
get you there.)
</P>
<P>
   The famed fund manager also acknowledges that index funds have
dominated managed funds during the past few years. However, he
admonishes that no cycle lasts forever. One thing he is rather
adamant about is that large capitalization stocks will have to hit
bottom and begin to rebound before beaten-down small-capitalization
stocks can even begin to make a move. In other words, small-caps
can't rally if large-caps are tanking.
</P>
<P>
   ``If big-cap stocks go down big-time, small stocks will go down
big-time,'' Lynch says.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _ All-Calculator Squad &LR; : Once again, Institutional Investor
magazine has released its annual ranking of sell-side financial
analysts (the equity researchers who work for investment banks and
brokerages). And once again, Merrill Lynch placed the highest
number of analysts on the highly regarded publication's All-America
research team. Goldman Sachs repeated its second-place performance
of a year ago, and Morgan Stanley Dean Witter was third.
</P>
<P>
   Near and dear to the Bay Area's heart are technology sector
analysts. That category was captured by Morgan Stanley, which
placed 10 tech analysts on the Institutional Investor all-star
squad.
</P>
<P>
   The rankings, which were determined by canvassing institutional
investors who deal with sell-side analysts, often give the
corporate finance side of an investment house a marketing edge.
Bankers sell potential clients on their analysts' clout with
investors and assure that the analysts will follow their stocks
after they go public or do a secondary offering. In turn, analysts
can sometimes leverage their star status to win seven-figure
compensation packages from investment houses. Perhaps, it's only a
matter of time before the free-agency era of financial analysts is
stifled by a salary cap.

THE PADRES' DEFENSE TAKES THE NIGHT OFF 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   NEW YORK _ In the opening game of the World Series, the San
Diego Padres' relief corps failed them. In the second game on
Sunday night, everything else went _ starting pitching, hitting and
fielding. But when all else fails, a team's defense, especially the
defense of a team in the World Series, should hold together. That
made the Yankees' 9-3 victory so much more painful for the Padres.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees scored six of those runs in the first two innings,
three in each, but it was entirely possible, the fallacy of the
predestined plays aside, that the Padres could have survived those
innings with no runs having scored had their fielders made the
plays that were there to make.
</P>
<P>
   Under the law of predestined plays, as promulgated by Ken Nigro,
a former Baltimore baseball reporter who is now a consultant to the
Padres (though not on their defense), a hit or any other kind of
play that follows another would not necessarily have occurred had
the previous play turned out differently.
</P>
<P>
   For example, if a runner at first base is out trying to steal
second and the batter then hits a home run, it cannot be assumed
that had the runner not tried to steal, it would have been a
two-run home run or that the batter would even have hit a home run.
</P>
<P>
   So there is no way of knowing if the plays that followed the
Padres' poor defensive plays would have happened if the poor plays
had actually been good plays. But the Padres can daydream about the
possibility, and right now all they can do is dream _ of a World
Series championship they hardly seem to have a chance of winning.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to the Padres' poor defensive play, the Yankees
averted an unpleasant beginning for Orlando Hernandez because of
Paul O'Neill's outstanding defensive play. With two runners on and
two out in the first inning, O'Neill made a running, leaping catch
of Wally Joyner's threatening fly ball against the right-field
fence.
</P>
<P>
   Joyner was also the victim of the second-best defensive play of
the night. In the fourth inning, Chuck Knoblauch, the Yankees'
second baseman, made a diving stop of Joyner's grounder on the
grass and threw him out.
</P>
<P>
   The Padres, who committed only one error in defeating Atlanta in
the six-game National League Championship Series, provided evidence
of the dreadful things that were to come for them with the very
first batter in the Yankees' lineup.
</P>
<P>
   That was Knoblauch, and he lofted a foul pop behind home plate.
Greg Myers, starting as the San Diego catcher for the first time
since Sept. 17, made a valiant effort, trying to snare the ball as
he slid on his knees toward and near the stands.
</P>
<P>
   Myers' timing was perfect because his glove and the ball arrived
at the same spot precisely at the same time. His ball-hand
coordination wasn't perfect, however, because the ball popped out
of his glove. Nice play, poor execution.
</P>
<P>
   Andy Ashby, the San Diego starter, proceeded to walk Knoblauch,
who then stole second before Derek Jeter grounded out.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neill followed with a grounder to third that could have been
the third out had Myers held Knoblauch's foul pop. It also could
have been the third out had Ken Caminiti, the third baseman, thrown
the ball accurately to first.
</P>
<P>
   Caminiti's throw was high, high enough that Joyner couldn't
catch it, even by jumping. The ball flicked off the top of his
glove and bounded into foul territory as Knoblauch raced home.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of the Yankees being out of the inning 1-2-3, they
scored three runs for a 3-0 lead, the other two coming on
successive singles by Chili Davis, Tino Martinez and Scott Brosius.
</P>
<P>
   The defense rested, but not for long.
</P>
<P>
   In the second inning, with Ricky Ledee at first on a single,
Knoblauch hit a grounder wide of third. Caminiti seemed to get a
slow jump on the ball, then dived for it. But the ball hit his left
wrist and continued into short left for a single.
</P>
<P>
   Jeter then hit a bouncer between second baseman Quilvio Veras
and second base. Veras had a shot at getting the ball, but as he
reached for it, it went under his glove for a run-scoring single.
</P>
<P>
   Ignoring the fallacy of the predestined plays, not to mention
the predestined batters, who would not have batted in the second
inning had Ashby had a 1-2-3 first, if Caminiti and Veras had made
good but makable plays on the two grounders, O'Neill's ensuing fly
to left would have been the third out and the Padres would have
escaped the inning without the Yankees scoring.
</P>
<P>
   But Knoblauch scored on Jeter's hit and Bernie Williams followed
O'Neill's fly out with a two-run home run. Ashby, who pitched with
a sore throat and a cold, gave up the hits, seven in the first two
innings, 10 altogether in his two and two-thirds innings of work.
But he would have fared far better with better defensive play
behind him. Solid defense was what the doctor ordered, but the
prescription went unfilled. &QL;
