	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Two top Khmer Rouge leaders long
wanted for genocide arrived by military helicopter Tuesday at a
base outside the capital to meet Prime Minister Hun Sen, who has
ruled out putting them on trial.
	   Khieu Samphan and Nuon Chea, key members of the inner circle of
late Khmer Rouge chieftain Pol Pot, emerged from the thick jungles
of the Thai border area last weekend and cut a defection deal with
the government that amounted to surrender.
	   In exchange for officially ending their part in a decades-old
guerrilla war, Hun Sen has defied calls by the international
community and many Cambodians to put them on trial for their roles
in the deaths of as many as 2 million people under their rule from
1975 to 1979.
	   ``If we bring them to trial, it will not benefit the nation, it
will only mean a return to civil war,'' Hun Sen said Monday. ``We
should dig a hole and bury the past and look toward the future.''
	   Khieu Samphan and Nuon Chea have been sheltered during the past
several days in Pailin, an ex-rebel stronghold run by former
comrades who forged their own peace agreement with the government
in 1996.
	   Such deals broke the back of the Khmer Rouge's long civil war
after being overthrown by a Vietnamese invasion in 1979, but now
that the movement is almost extinct, many wonder when someone will
finally be held accountable for their murderous rule.
	   Under heavy guard, the pair and their families lifted off from
behind the Pailin police station for the two-hour flight to
Takhmau, a Phnom Penh suburb where Hun Sen lives on a military base
dubbed the ``Tiger's Lair.''
	   Leading members of the Cambodian People's Party _ led by those
who, like Hun Sen, were once Khmer Rouge cadres before fleeing
bloody purges _ were arriving Tuesday morning. Soldiers refused
many journalists access.
	   Khieu Samphan was the Khmer Rouge's nominal leader during the
group's existence, though it is debatable how much influence he
had.
	   Pol Pot and other top leaders jealously guarded their identities
and were rarely seen in public, preferring to send Khieu Samphan to
speak for them.
	   Nuon Chea was regarded as Pol Pot's second-in-command and chief
political theorist. There is extensive evidence of his role in mass
executions of party members the hierarchy suspected of treason.
	   The inner workings of the group remain a source of debate.
Former members of the inner circle who have defected tend to place
all blame on Pol Pot, who died in April of a heart attack.
	   Only one guerilla leader is left at large: Ta Mok, known as
``The Butcher,'' is somewhere near the Thai border with no more
than 100 die-hard loyalists. They pose no threat to the government.
	   Despite Hun Sen's statements that Khieu Samphan and Nuon Chea
would not be tried, some human-rights activists were still holding
out hope that they would eventually face justice.
	   Youk Chhang, director of a center that gathers evidence of the
genocide, said Hun Sen may be playing a political game with his
pronouncements to lure the pair into custody.
	   ``The circumstances may have forced him to say something like
this,'' Youk Chhang said of Hun Sen's assurances of no trial. ``We
will have to wait and see what will be next.''
	   The United States and other countries should temper calls for a
trial and give Hun Sen time to maneuver, he said.
	   Government spokesman Khieu Kanharith said talk of a trial had
made the defectors afraid they would be arrested.
	   In Washington, the U.S. State Department noted Sunday that the
Cambodian government has repeatedly asked for _ and received _ help
in bringing top Khmer Rouge leaders to justice.
	   Hun Sen said he had support for an amnesty deal for the pair
from King Norodom Sihanouk and the leader of the National Assembly,
Prince Norodom Ranariddh.
	   The opposition Sam Rainsy party, however, said the men should be
arrested and tried for crimes against humanity.

Tigers sign Jefferies to a two-year deal
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DETROIT (AP) _ Gregg Jefferies, who has failed to live up to his
potential since breaking into the major leagues in 1987, agreed
Monday to a two-year contract with the Detroit Tigers worth about
dlrs 5 million.
	   Jefferies, a 31-year outfielder, spent more than 3 1/2 seasons
with Philadelphia until the Phillies traded him to Anaheim last
Aug. 28. He became a free agent after the season.
	   He hit .294 with eight homers and 48 RBIs for the Phillies, then
batted .347 with one homer and 10 RBIs in 72 at-bats with the
Angels.
	   In another deal, Detroit acquired outfielder Karim Garcia from
Arizona for outfielder Luis Gonzalez and cash.
	   ``Today's moves address both the present and future of the
Detroit Tigers,'' Tigers general manager Randy Smith said. ``Gregg
Jefferies is one of the game's top hitters with excellent ability
to put the ball in play from both sides of the plate.''
	   Jefferies spent five seasons with the New York Mets but never
turned into the power-hitting star they hoped he would become. New
York dealt him to Kansas City after the 1991 season. He spent one
year with the Royals and two with the St. Louis Cardinals, then
joined the Phillies following the 1994-95 strike.
	   Jefferies, a switch-hitter who has played first, second and the
outfield, has a .292 career batting average with 118 homers and 631
RBIs. He ranks eighth among active players in walks-to-strikeouts
ratio (443/327) and was second to Tony Gwynn last year with just
one strikeout per 18.3 at-bats.
	   Jefferies bounced back last season following a career-worst .256
average in 1997, when he played with a strained hamstring and an
injured thumb.
	   Detroit, which has a club option for 2001, has not finalized the
exact split of Jefferies' deal.
	   Garcia, 22, played 113 games with the Diamondbacks last season,
hitting .222 with nine homers and 43 RBIs.
	   ``Karim Garcia is a top power-hitting prospect who we believe
has not yet reached his potential and has a high ceiling for the
future,'' Smith said.
	   Gonzalez, 31, joined the Tigers in 1998 as a free agent, signing
a dlrs 4 million, two-year deal. He hit .267 in 154 games last
season with 23 home runs, 71 RBIs and 12 steals.

	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ A frantic rescue operation was scaled
back Tuesday after authorities hauled out the bodies of two sailors
killed in stormy waters during the deadliest Sydney-to-Hobart yacht
race on record.
	   Four bodies have been recovered. British sailor Glyn Charles,
33, was washed off the Sword of Orion yacht Sunday night and
declared drowned on Tuesday, becoming the fifth fatality, said
Australian Maritime Safety Authority spokesman Brian Hill.
	   Race officials said Charles had represented Britain in the Star
Class at the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta, where he finished
11th.
	   The two bodies found Tuesday were from the 56-year-old cutter
Winston Churchill and one of their colleagues was still missing.
	   Two other sailors were found dead Monday when the 40-foot
(12-meter) boat Business Post Naiad capsized 60 miles (95
kilometers) off the New South Wales town of Merimbula.
	   They were identified as the yacht's owner-skipper Bruce Guy and
crew member Phil Skeggs.
	   ``We have found two deceased people today and we're still
looking for the missing man, but it's becoming more and more
difficult,'' Hill told The Associated Press.
	   While 35 civilian and military aircraft and a similar number of
boats set out on searches Tuesday, the rescue force had been scaled
back to eight aircraft by 2:30 p.m. local time (0330GMT).
	   There had been only two reported deaths previously in the
54-year history of Australia's greatest yacht race. The 725-mile
(1,166-kilometer) event starts the day after Christmas and attracts
top class sailors and yachts from around the world.
	   Of the 115 yachts that entered this year, 59 were forced to seek
shelter and several boats were abandoned, race officials said.
There was no nationality listing for the approximately 1,000
sailors who set off in the race.
	   Australia mounted one of its largest maritime rescue operations
ever. Military helicopters hovered over 35-foot (10.5-meter) swells
to hoist about 50 other sailors to safety off Australia's southeast
coast, 250 miles (400 kilometers) south of Sydney.
	   Many of the sailors were injured _ with broken bones, dislocated
shoulders, cuts on the face and hands _ from being struck by broken
rigging or tossed upside down when their boats capsized.
	   American Larry Ellison, the chief executive officer and founder
of technology giant Oracle Corp., won his second race when his maxi
yacht Sayonara arrived in Hobart, Tasmania, Tuesday morning.
	   The 23-member crew arrived at Constitution Dock to a funereal
atmosphere, rather than the usual mood of celebration.
	   ``It was just awful, I've never experienced anything remotely
like this,'' Ellison said of the raging seas which peaked Sunday
and Monday. ``It's been a very emotional experience to get here.
This is not what this is supposed to be about. It's a tough crew,
but the guys were choked up.''
	   Sayonara helmsman Chris Dickson said the crew was thinking more
about the sailors in trouble than the victory.
	   ``Being here first is nice but being here at all is a big thing
and we're thinking about those who are still out there, not
thinking too much about how we've done,'' Dickson said. ``Anyone
who is not scared in those conditions is not human.''
	   On Tuesday, the two dead men were winched from a swell of about
3-meters (9-feet). The first came out just before Sayonara docked
in Hobart and the second just after.
	   Navy helicopter pilot Tanzi Lea, who found the two bodies two
miles (3.2 kilometers) apart and 50 miles (80 kilometers) offshore
early Tuesday, said they were both found face down and were picked
out by nets.
	   ``It wasn't so difficult because the seas had abated a bit but
we were just lucky to find the second body,'' Lea told The
Associated Press. ``The chances of the third man being found alive
are slim, but I'd never give up hope.''
	   The three members of the Winston Churchill _ Jim Lawler, Mike
Bannister and John Dean _ went missing after six of their crew
mates were plucked from two life rafts in the huge 10-meter
(30-feet) seas of Bass Strait.
	   Officials have yet to say which of the men are dead and who is
missing.
	   Sea Hawk helicopter pilot Nic Trimmor, who rescued two survivors
in the second raft, said the three were washed away by a single
wave after hanging on grimly.
	   ``They got hit by numerous big waves, but one wave in particular
threw three of them out and they were unable to recover these three
back into the life raft,'' Trimmor said.
	   Winston Churchill skipper Richard Winning, who was rescued off
one of the life rafts, told of a frantic struggle to stay alive.
	   ``After we got into the life raft and became separated from the
others, the damned thing capsized twice on these great seas at
night which is bloody frightening, let me tell you,'' Winning said.
	   ``You have got four of us underneath this little canopy and the
next thing is you are upside down. I wouldn't want to have spent
another night out there.''
	   While two others were picked up from another life raft late
Monday, Winning only found out three of his crew were missing as he
gave a television interview Tuesday.
	   ``I just heard what you said in your intro there, that a couple
of fellows were reported washed off. That's the first I've heard of
that,'' Winning told the reporter.
	   Sayonara, the 1995 winner, crossed the finish line on the
Derwent River at Hobart on Tuesday morning to take line honors
ahead of Brindabella.
	   Although its early speed had it on track for Morning Glory's
1996 record, fading winds meant it finished about five hours
outside the mark.

Doctor: Police use `questionable' procedures in DNA tests
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ALVIN UNG &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Police used ``highly
questionable'' procedures in collecting DNA samples from sacked
Deputy Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim, a state doctor testified
Tuesday in Anwar's sex and corruption trial.
	   Dr. Vahari Noor, a forensic expert at the state-run General
Hospital, the prosecution's 20th witness, testified that he took
blood samples from Anwar on Sept. 28th.
	   Anwar was at police headquarters, eight days after his arrest.
He agreed to give blood samples that were to be tested for the HIV
virus, hepatitis and venereal disease, Vahari said.
	   Anwar was fired by Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad on Sept. 2,
after Mahathir deemed him morally unfit to lead the country. He is
on trial for abuse of power and will be tried separately on charges
of engaging in illegal sex acts, including sodomy.
	   Vahari testified Tuesday that Anwar never gave permission for
his blood to be tested for DNA. He said police demanded the blood
more than two months later so they could test it for DNA.
	   Defense attorney Christopher Fernando asked whether the blood
would still be viable for DNA testing.
	   ``The results of the DNA testing done on this sample would be
highly questionable,'' Vahari said. ``The blood being sent after
about two and one-half months ... is an inordinate delay by any
standard.''
	   Vahari said the blood cells containing the DNA would have
perished because no anti-clotting chemicals had been added to
Anwar's original blood samples.
	   On Monday, Dr. Halim Haji Manzar, a pathologist at General
Hospital, testified that the blood taken from Anwar was given
directly to police and they never had a chance to test it for
sexually transmitted diseases.
	   The prosecution was expected to put state DNA experts on the
stand to testify that DNA samples taken from Anwar matched those of
semen stains found on a mattress in an apartment where Anwar
allegedly carried on his sexual trysts.
	   The defense, anticipating this tactic, is trying to show the
judge that at no time did Anwar give permission for his blood to be
tested for DNA. Defense attorneys Monday implied that hair and
semen samples may have been taken from Anwar while he was
unconscious after his beating in police custody.
	   Fernando on Tuesday popped a question that led to strenuous
prosecution objection and a recess in the trial.
	   He asked Vahari: ``When you examined Sukma Darmawan, you found
that he had no homosexual history when you conducted an anal test
on him?''
	   But the question was never answered.
	   Sukma, Anwar's adopted brother, was serving a six-month term for
confessing that he allowed the ex-deputy prime minister to sodomize
him, a crime in this Muslim country.
	   Sukma, currently out on bail, says he was coerced by police into
making a guilty plea and is appealing his conviction.
	   Anwar has denied all the accusations against him, saying they
were trumped up to eliminate his challenge to Mahathir's 17-year
rule.

Reports: Site of fatal Thai crash vows to fix runway lights
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ An airport in southern Thailand where a
plane crash killed 101 people this month has said its runway lights
will be fixed by the new year, local papers reported on Tuesday.
	   Surat Thani Airport Director Chamnong Sarn-aksorn said workers
were speeding up repairs to the lighting system and all runway
lights should be working by the end of the week, The Nation
reported.
	   The cause of the crash of Thai Airways flight TG261, which
smashed into a swamp amid a night rain storm on December 11, is
under investigation by a government committee.
	   Some of the 45 survivors have blamed the pilot for attempting a
third landing in bad weather after failing the first two times. The
pilot also died.
	   But questions have also arisen about the safety of the airport
in Surat Thani, 530 kilometers (330 miles) southwest of Bangkok.
	   Airport officials have admitted they removed the instrument
landing system, which helps pilots land during bad weather, during
a runway renovation several months earlier.
	   Also, they have said half the runway lights were not working
because of problems with the electrical system that hadn't yet been
fixed.
	   The pilot had complained he could not see the runway during his
failed attempts to land.

India has New Zealand facing defeat in the second test
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES at stumps
 &UR; By IHITHISHAM KAMARDEEN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) _ India rallied around a brilliant
century by Sachin Tendulkar to have New Zealand staring at defeat
in the second cricket test at the Basin Reserve Tuesday.
	   New Zealand, chasing 213 to win, was 73 for four at stumps on
the fourth day with Craig McMillan on 17 and Paul Wiseman yet to
score.
	   After Tendulkar's 113 had inspired India to a second innings
356, leg-spinner Anil Kumble triggered a New Zealand slide with the
important wickets of Stephen Fleming and opener Matthew Fleming in
a three-over spell.
	   New Zealand's hopes took another body blow when the inform
Nathan Astle suffered a broken bone in his left hand off paceman
Javagal Srinath.
	   Astle, who hit 56 in the first innings, will bat if required but
a New Zealand Cricket spokeswoman said he would likely be sidelined
for 3-4 weeks.
	   Kumble followed up his invaluable contribution with the bat _ 23
runs in a 42-run stand with Srinath _ by finishing the day with
2-19 in 11 overs.
	   After losing debutant opener Matthew Bell to a third ball duck,
Horne and Fleming took New Zealand to 42 when Kumble struck in his
fourth over.
	   Fleming (17) let go a delivery, but the ball spun sharply off
the bowlers' foot-holes and hit the left hander's off stump.
	   Horne batted 88 minutes for 31 before he was trapped leg before
wicket by a Kumble ``flipper'' that hurried on him.
	   The last time New Zealand successfully chased over 200 runs was
against Pakistan in Christchurch in 1993-94 when it made 324 for
the loss of five wickets.
	   The highest fourth innings total chased at the Basin Reserve was
181 by New Zealand against Australia in March 1990.
	   India's hopes of setting a big fourth innings target disappeared
with the dismissal of Tendulkar, who hit his 17th test century and
his first against New Zealand.
	   Dion Nash, whose unbeaten 89 inspired New Zealand to a handy
144-run lead, triggered a middle order collapse after lunch and
India never recovered.
	   Nash, surprisingly held back from the bowling crease for 64
overs as India moved ominously to 297 for four, struck with his
first ball of the day, claiming the prized scalp of Tendulkar.
	   Tendulkar having reached his century with a six for the third
time in a 63-match career, drove loosely at Nash to give first slip
Fleming a simple catch.
	   India lost 3-7 in 21 balls including Mohammed Azharuddin for 48
runs. The Indian skipper showed his displeasure after West Indies
umpire Eddie Nicholls adjudged him caught behind to give Nash 2-3
in 12 balls.
	   New Zealand coach Steve Rixon admitted India must be favored to
take a 1-0 lead in the series.
	   ``It has been a game which no team has managed to dominate,''
Rixon said. ``For once it is leaning slightly in India's favor.
Kumble is the threat tomorrow and if we can get through him with 1
decent partnership we can win.''

seconds later.
 &UR; Canada 6, Finland 4
	   At Winnipeg, Jason Chimera scored his first two international
goals leading Canada to victory over defending champion Finland.

empty-netter, also scored for Canada (1-0-1), which opened the game
with two goals in the first three minutes.
	   Canada led 3-0 after the first period, but sagged in the second
period.
	   Philadelphia Flyers draft pick Marko Kauppinen put Finland (1-1)
within one goal of Canada on a power play at the end of the second
period after goals from teammates Olli Ahonen and Tampa Bay
Lightning prospect Eero Somervuori.
	   Tomek Valtonen scored for Finland on a power play with 18
seconds left in the game before Gagne put the game away for Canada.
	   The top three teams in each five-team pool advance to the
quarterfinals with the top team in each pool earning a bye.

Report: Bank clerk embezzles for Internet friend in Canada
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ A Singapore bank clerk embezzled from her Dutch
employer so she could loan money to a Canadian man she knew only
via the Internet and phone conversations, a newspaper reported
Tuesday.
	   Ooi May Ling, a former clerk at Dutch bank ABN Amro, was
sentenced by a Singapore court on Monday to one year in jail, said
The Straits Times, which had a reporter in the courtroom.
	   She stole dlrs 22,502 from the bank in October, then used it to
settle huge phone bills chalked up in calls to John Elia, whom she
met via the Internet in June, and transferred dlrs 6,663 to his
account, the report said.
	   Elia, whose home town was not reported, had told her he was
facing financial hardship because he was unemployed, and had also
said he was a former employee of the Bank of Montreal, the paper
said. She had been sending him money since August, it added.
	   Ooi, who had been employed at ABN Amro for nearly two years,
returned about 40 percent of the stolen money to the bank, but the
funds sent to Elia had not been recovered.

Devils 7, Sabres 4
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUFFALO, New York (AP) _ Buffalo goalie Dominik Hasek had a rare
bad game, and the New Jersey Devils made the most of it with a 7-4
victory over the Sabres on Monday night.
	   Twp nights after being shut out by the two-time Hart Trophy
winner, the Devils scored on each of their first three shots and
put four of six past Hasek.
	   Krzysztof Oliwa, Brendan Morrison, Petr Sykora and Dave
Andreychuk scored to give the Devils a 4-1 lead and oust Hasek just
22 seconds into the second. Hasek hadn't allowed three goals in the
first period of a game since a 3-1 loss to the Devils on Dec. 24,
1997.
	   The Devils lost to the Sabres 2-0 in the first game of the
home-and-home series Saturday night as Hasek made 34 saves. New
Jersey has won seven of eight against the Sabres.
	   Hasek hadn't allowed a goal in 163 minutes, 35 seconds.
 &UR; Capitals 5, Bruins 1 &QC; 
	   At Washington, Peter Bondra, Ken Klee and Sergei Gonchar scored
first-period goals as the Washington Capitals returned home from
the longest road trip in team history and beat the Boston Bruins.
	   The Capitals, who scored only 11 goals while going 2-6 on their
three-week trip, notched three goals on 18 shots _ the most they
have taken during an opening period this season.
	   Only seven minor penalties and two majors were called, a stark
contrast to the fight-filled meeting between the two teams on Nov.
21 _ a 5-4 overtime triumph by Boston at the Fleet Center.
 &UR; Blues 4, Red Wings 4 &QC; 
	   At Detroit, Vyacheslav Kozlov scored two goals that counted and
two that didn't as the Detroit Red Wings snapped a five-game losing
streak _ their longest since January 1991.
	   Kozlov's second goal forged the tie with 9:13 remaining,
bringing Detroit back from a 4-2 deficit in the second period. He
also had two apparent scores wiped out by video review, and took a
penalty that negated a teammate's goal _ all in the first period.
	   Steve Yzerman and Kris Draper scored the other Detroit goals.
	   Chris Pronger had two goals and an assist for the Blues, who
also got goals from Michal Handzus and Scott Pellerin. St. Louis is
winless (0-5-5) in its last 10 road games.
 &UR; Mighty Ducks 2, Senators 2 &QC; 
	   At Kanata, Ontario, Shawn McEachern's second goal of the game
and team-leading 15th this season _ with six seconds left in
regulation _ gave the Ottawa Senators a tie with the Anaheim Mighty
Ducks.
	   McEachern sent the game into overtime by burying a rebound past
Anaheim goalie Dominic Roussel. McEachern also beat Roussel on the
first shot of the game, but the Anaheim goalie then shut the door
until the final seconds.
	   Frederik Olausson and Marty McInnis scored for the Ducks, as
Ottawa outshot Anaheim 39-16. The Ducks were coming off six days'
rest and had lost only one of their previous eight.
 &UR; Panthers 5, Islanders 1 &QC; 
	   At Sunrise, Florida, defensemen Paul Laus and Terry Carkner
scored rare goals as Florida beat the New York Islanders for the
Panthers' fourth victory in the last five games.
	   Oleg Kvasha, Ray Whitney and Carkner all had a goal and an
assist, while Viktor Kozlov added three assists to help Florida
climb over .500 (13-12-6) for the first time since Nov. 12.
	   Carkner scored his first goal in 66 games _ the fifth of his
13-year career _ to give the Panthers a 1-0 lead at 4:53 of the
first period. Laus scored his first since April 6, 1996 _ a span of
188 games _ to increase Florida's lead to 3-0 at 4:40 of the
second. It was his sixth career goal.
	   Panthers goalie Sean Burke stopped 26 shots for his fifth
victory in seven games (5-1-1).
 &UR; Stars 1, Predators 0 &QC; 
	   At Dallas, Shawn Chambers scored the only goal, and Ed Belfour
made 14 saves as the Dallas Stars remained unbeaten in 12 games to
match a franchise record.
	   Belfour got his third shutout of the season and 43rd of his
career as the Stars bettered their unbeaten run to 9-0-3. The Stars
are in the midst of their longest unbeaten string since the
Minnesota North Stars went 9-0-3 from Feb. 18-March 15, 1982.
	   Defenseman Chambers scored midway through the second period for
the Stars, who haven't lost since Dec. 4 at Vancouver.
 &UR; Kings 4, Coyotes 2 &QC; 
	   At Phooenix, Luc Robitaille scored twice _ including the
game-winner with 8:48 remaining _ and added an assist as the Los
Angeles Kings beat Phoenix to end the Coyotes' 11-game home
unbeaten streak.
	   Jozef Stumpel also scored a pair of goals for the resurgent
Kings (11-21-3), who have won three of their last four games.
	   Rick Tocchet and Daniel Briere scored for the Coyotes, now
10-2-1 at home. Phoenix had not lost on home since dropping its
opener Oct. 11 to Ottawa.

American man charged for importing cocaine
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ An American who arrived at Sydney
airport in a wheelchair tried to smuggle 3.6 kilograms (8 pounds)
of cocaine into Australia so he could pay for cancer treatment, a
court was told Tuesday.
	   Herbert Edward Mazzola, 53, an accountant from Tampa, Florida,
was charged in Central Local Court with trying to import a
trafficable quantity of the drug.
	   Police prosecutor Sgt. Paul Taylor said Mazzola arrived in
Sydney late Monday night and was wheeled into the terminal building
by Qantas staff.
	   At first he told Australian Customs officials he had nothing to
declare, but later admitted he had the cocaine in packages strapped
to his legs and buttocks, the police prosecutor said.
	   Mazzola said he brought the drugs into Australia so he could
help pay for treatment for lung cancer and brain lesions. Taylor
said Mazzola had a wife and 10-year-old daughter in Florida.
	   Magistrate Geoffrey Bradd remanded Mazzola in custody until Jan.
27. Mazzola did not enter a plea or apply for bail.

Report: Fugitive Indonesian businessman working in China
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) - An Indonesian businessman who escaped
from jail in 1996 after being convicted of fraud is running a
successful brewery in China, local media reported Tuesday.
	   Eddy Tansil, who was sentenced to 20 years in prison in one of
Indonesia's biggest financial scandals, has business ties to
Germany's Beck's Beer Co., a watchdog group said.
	   Tansil, an ethnic Chinese tycoon, is owner of Putian Golden Key
Brewery Co. in the Chinese city of Putian in Fujian province,
newspapers quoted the Gempita group as saying.
	   Gempita is the acronym in the Indonesian language for Movement
of Concerned Citizens to Save State Assets.
	   Established in 1992, Putian Golden Key is now a major player in
China's premium beer market and is worth dlrs 10 million, Gempita
chairman Albert Hasibuan said. It allegedly has a licensing
agreement with Beck's Beer.
	   Tansil was convicted in 1994 of defrauding the government of
dlrs 430 million in a case that became a symbol of official
corruption in Indonesia.
	   Prosecutors said he obtained the money as a loan after bribing
officials of state-owned Bank Pembangunan Indonesia, or Bapindo.
	   Tansil said he would use the loan to build a petrochemicals
factory, but then pocketed part or all of the money. The factory
was never completed.
	   Two former Cabinet ministers were questioned in court, but never
indicted.
	   After serving two years of his sentence, Tansil escaped from
jail after bribing jail officials and eluded a nationwide manhunt.
	   Gempita said Tansil has not changed his name since his arrest
and is known in China as ``Mr. E.T.''
	   Widespread allegations of official corruption helped erode the
credibility of former President Suharto, who quit in May after
riots and protests against his rule.
	   Much of the rioting by Indonesia's poor was directed at the
homes and shops of ethnic Chinese because of their relative wealth
and perceived links to corrupt government officials.

Ellison arrives first in tragic race

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES death toll to five. EDITS &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   HOBART, Australia (AP) _ United States billionaire Larry
Ellison, teary-eyed after battling through deadly waves in the
Sydney-to-Hobart yacht race Tuesday, said he said he had never
experienced worse conditions at sea.
	   Ellison, the founder and chief executive of computer giant
Oracle, won his second Sydney-to-Hobart race but arrived in Hobart
early Tuesday to a funereal atmosphere.
	   Asked if he'd come back again, Ellison said, ``My first reaction
is not if I live to a thousand years. But who knows?''
	   ``It was just awful, I've never experienced anything remotely
like this,'' Ellison said. ``It's been a very emotional experience
to get here. This is not what this is supposed to be about. A lot
of us are upset.''
	   Ellison said it was an extraordinarily difficult journey as his
yacht battled ``right through the eye of a hurricane'' and his crew
heard by radio of the deaths in the battered fleet.
	   Sayonara finished the race in two days, 20 hours, three minutes
and 32 seconds, but missing the record time was irrelevant to the
shaken crew, which included media magnate Rupert Murdoch's son
Lachlan.
	   ``Guys were knocked down time and time again, but kept getting
up to do what had to be done to keep us alive,'' Ellison said.
``It's a tough crew, but the guys were choked up. We were learning
of people dying.''
	   At least five sailors have died and another is missing, presumed
drowned, in the worst tragedy to hit the race in its 54-year
history.
	   Sayonara crossed the finishing line to a subdued welcome by a
smaller-than-usual spectator fleet and dockside crowd. The 23-man
crew aboard the maxi were safe, except for one who had a broken
ankle.
	   A welcome celebration was postponed and the trophy presentation
was delayed until January 2.
	   ``That's as tough as it gets,'' said Sayonara's helmsman Chris
Dickson. ``Being here first is nice but being here at all is a big
thing and we're thinking about those who are still out there, not
thinking too much about how we've done.''
	   New Zealander Dickson, who said he has experienced similar
conditions in the Whitbread Around the World race, was unsure if he
would attempt this event again.
	   ``Anyone who is not scared in those conditions is not human,''
Dickson said. ``For a long time in Bass Strait we were not racing.
Nor was anyone else.''
	   Murdoch, chief executive of family-owned Australian newspaper
business News Limited, said the race was a great tragedy which the
crew was still trying to absorb.
	   ``Everyone here is very saddened and it gives you mixed feelings
about being part of it all,'' Murdoch said.

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES death toll to five in 2nd graf &QL;

	   MERIMBULA, Australia (AP) _ Navy pilot Tanzi Lea peered down
into mountainous seas and was carried back 20 years to the 1979
Fastnet race where 15 sailors persihed.
	   Lea was the pilot of a navy Sea King helicopter which hauled two
dead sailors out of Bass Strait Tuesday, bringing the death toll
from the Sydney-to-Hobart race to five confirmed with one other
presumed drowned.
	   He was a member of Britain's Royal Navy during the Fastnet
rescue off the south west coast of Ireland where only 85 yachts
finished out of 303 starters because of high winds and punishing
waves.
	   ``The seas were as big as I saw during rescues in the Fastnet
race 20 years ago,'' Lea told The Associated Press after arriving
back with the two bodies Tuesday. ``Under those circumstances
you've got to be careful and act prudently.''
	   Lea, now with the Australian navy, was involved throughout this
search and rescue process. He said the weather was at its worst
Monday and Sunday but had calmed considerably by the time his
helicopter reached the bodies Tuesday.
	   ``A big depression formed quickly and although a change was
expected I don't think people thought it would be this bad,'' Lea
said.
	   The two dead men were believed to be from the veteran cutter
Winston Churchill. Another crew member is missing while six others
were carried to safety.
	   Two of the men saved were in a life raft which had its bottom
torn away by heavy seas. A wave knocked their three mates out of
reach.
	   Shane Pashley, a navy diver, reached the two crew members who
had managed to hang onto the remnants of their life raft.
	   ``We winched the first guy up who was absolutely exhausted, the
waves were crashing over the top of the raft which made it very
difficult as I was continually dragged under the water,'' Pashley
told AP. ``Once we'd winched him up we put him on the floor of the
aircraft and turned the heaters up because he was suffering from
exposure.''
	   The harness was sent down for the second survivor but it snagged
on the life raft. He was eventually hauled aboard the helicopter.
	   ``One bloke said he knew where the other guys were but we
couldn't do anything as we were nearly out of fuel,'' Pashley said.
``They were just really tired and very thirsty, one of the guys was
only wearing a spray jacket and shorts.''
	   Pashley, like most Australians, has vivid memories of the rescue
of English yachtie Tony Bullimore, who showed unrestrained joy
after being found following four days alone at sea in early 1997.
	   But there was no great sense of celebration for Pashley.
	   ``There were no Tony Bullimore-style kisses,'' he said. ``They
were just done.''

Bodies of foreign hostages returned to Britain

<TEXT>
	   BAKU, Azerbaijan (AP) _ The bodies of four men beheaded in
Chechnya were handed over to British officials early Tuesday and
put on a plane for London.
	   The remains were put on to a British Airways flight in the
presence of British diplomats and Chechen officials before dawn.
Azeri soldiers carried the coffins of the four and placed them on
the plane.
	   The bodies had arrived earlier from Chechnya in a convoy
accompanied by Chechen Deputy Prime Minister Turpal Atgeriyev and
Deputy Prosecutor General Magomed Magomadov.
	   Officials from the British Embassy in Azerbaijan met the convoy
in Russia, according to Russian press reports.
	   The handover was originally planned for Monday, but appeared to
have been delayed by the sides' disagreement on where it should
take place.
	   A spokesman for the British Embassy in Moscow, Mike Haddock,
said Britain wanted the handover to take place in the Russian
capital, the Interfax news agency reported.
	   But Chechnya's Deputy Prime Minister Kazbek Makhashev said the
separatist republic considered the proposal ``unacceptable'' and
wanted the bodies to be handed over in Azerbaijan, Interfax
reported.
	   Chechnya, which had fought a 1994-96 war for secession from
Russia, adamantly tries to assert its independence from Moscow. No
country has recognized its sovereignty.
	   The bodies of the four men were found Saturday in the village of
Chernorechiye, on the outskirts of the Chechen capital, Grozny.
Doctors confirmed the identities of the bodies Sunday, according to
Chechen Prosecutor General Mansur Tagirov.
	   The four men _ Peter Kennedy, Darren Hickey and Rudolf Petschi
of Britain, and New Zealand's Stanley Shaw _ were kidnapped Oct. 3,
and their severed heads were found by a roadside on Dec. 8.
	   A mourning service for the four was held Monday in the church of
St. Archangel Michael in Grozny, the capital of predominantly
Muslim Chechnya.
	   Authorities said the men, who were in Chechnya to set up a
cellular phone system, had been killed after a rescue attempt went
wrong.
	   The region, in the southern Caucasus, has seen a boom in crime
and kidnappings for ransom since Chechnya's independence war ended.

Pilots get the feel for space during tests for balloon flight

<TEXT>
	   ALICE SPRINGS, Australia (AP) _ Looking for all the world like a
cosmonaut, balloon pilot John Wallington on Tuesday climbed into
the space suit he will wear during the latest bid to fly nonstop
around the world, giving the thumbs up to its Russian designer.
	   Following the emergency procedures he and his two U.S.
counterparts will follow if anything goes wrong during their
planned subspace flight, Wallington laced, strapped and zipped
himself in before the pressurized suit was inflated with compressed
air.
	   Denver real estate magnate Dave Liniger, Albuquerque, New Mexico
journalist Bob Martin and Australian Wallington expect to take off
Jan. 1 in their bid to pilot a giant balloon around the world,
avoiding adverse weather by flying on the edge of space.
	   Their bid comes just days after Chicago millionaire Steve
Fossett and his team splashed down in the Pacific Ocean, ending the
latest attempt in a more conventional balloon.
	   Final construction of the capsule and equipment checks are
underway in the Australian Outback town of Alice Springs, where
winds and unseasonal summer rains over the desert launch zone have
delayed takeoff by several days.
	   Boris Mikhajlov, an engineer from the Russian space company
Zvezda, which makes space suits for the Soyuz and Mir space
programs, overlooked Wallington's test and spoke to him through the
suit's intercom with the aid of a Russian interpreter.
	   ``This reminds us we're going to near space,'' said Wallington,
after deflating the suit and unclipping the dome-like visor.
	   ``I have total faith in the suits but I sincerely hope that we
don't have to climb into them.''
	   The trio will wear the hot, uncomfortable gear during the
balloon's takeoff and landing _ the most dangerous times _ and then
only if something goes wrong during the flight.
	   The worst thing than could happen is ``explosive decompression''
of the capsule _ a sudden breach of the hull big enough to
instantly turn the atmosphere inside from livable to unbreathable.
There is only 0.3 percent of the Earth's atmosphere where the
balloon will be flying.
	   ``If there is a catastrophic failure, the pilots won't even
know, it will be too fast,'' team spokesman Kevin Roark said.
	   ``If there is a slow leak, which is more likely, the pilots will
be able to get into their suits and either plug the leak with
special tape or make the decision to come down.''
	   The capsule will dangle beneath a polyethylene balloon that is
460 feet (140 meters) in diameter at ``full float'' and 700 feet
(210 meters) high, large enough to envelope the Houston Astrodome.
	   It will rise 1,000 feet (300 meters) a minute during takeoff to
reach a cruising altitude of 130,000 feet (40,000 meters), or about
24 miles (39 kilometers), above sea level.
	   There, the team expects to catch winds that will carry it west
at up to 80 mph (128 miles) along a route that almost directly
follows the Tropic of Capricorn and complete the 22,800-mile
(37,000-kilometer) journey in about 18 days.
	   The NASA-developed balloon type has been used before, but only
to carry unmanned scientific payloads to heights of about 80,000
feet (24,000 meters).
	   Life support systems aboard the capsule include dehumidifiers to
remove perspiration and respiration moisture, oxygen and nitrogen
tanks to provide breathable air and a solid waste disposal unit.
	   Science and research projects the pilots will take part in
include collecting data on upward lightning for the Los Alamos
National Laboratory at the University of California and medical and
other studies for the University of Colorado and the University of
New Mexico.

No joy in Hobart when winner crosses line
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HOBART, Australia (AP) _ There was more uneasy silence than
celebration, more tears than smiles. No cannons blasting, no
champagne corks popping.
	   Sayonara, 80 feet of gleaming white carbon fiber, sailed
serenely up the Derwent River on Tuesday morning in a pleasant
southwesterly to cross the line a convincing winner of the 54th
Sydney-to-Hobart yacht race.
	   On board the world maxi champion with the professional sailors
were some of the world's movers and shakers _ men who exercise
enormous power in human affairs.
	   Behind them in abating seas were the victims of nature at its
most ferocious. Abandoned hulks of once-proud yachts, one a
floating coffin. Five, almost certainly six, dead; families
grieving on both ends of the world.
	   There was an eerie atmosphere as Sayonara sailed in, for
everyone knew this was no ordinary yacht race.
	   Normally the finish of Australia's premier blue-water classic is
a time for celebration.
	   On Tuesday, the spectator fleet was smaller and the crowds
around Constitution Dock thinner than usual. The traditional three
cheers for the winner were hesitant.
	   The planned fireworks, cannon and champagne reception were
canceled. The trophy presentation was put back for five days.
	   There was no big speech from Sayonara's owner and skipper Larry
Ellison.
	   Ellison, 54, is the billionaire head of the American software
giant Oracle with a reputation for being determined to win in sport
and business.
	   But it was a different Ellison on Tuesday.
	   ``It wasn't a race,'' he said. ``We were not focused on a race,
we were focused on getting this boat here in one piece and every
one of the crew here.''
	   As he looked back on the storms and the deaths, he said: ``This
is not what it's supposed to be about.
	   ``Difficult, yes. Dangerous, no. Life-threatening, definitely
not.''
	   Ellison admitted he didn't know whether he'd go ocean-racing
again.
	   ``I may reassess my attitude,'' he said. ``It will take a little
time to place this in perspective.''
	   He's promised to join American media mogul Ted Turner in next
year's Fastnet _ the 20th anniversary of the Fastnet that claimed
19 lives.
	   ``Ted did the Fastnet in '79,'' Ellison said. ``I want to talk
to him about that. He didn't race much after that.
	   ``Right now I'm not anxious to go back and do another ocean
race.''

Nissan shuts Indonesian car factory
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Japan' Nissan Motor Co. and its
partners decided to close their Indonesian car factory because of
poor economic conditions, the Jakarta stock exchange said.
	   One of Nissan's partners, PT Indomobil Sukses Internasional,
sent a letter to the exchange in which it announced the closure of
PT Ismac Nissan Manufacturing.
	   ``The decision was made on grounds that a recovery in the
country's automotive industry can't be achieved soon,'' the stock
exchange on Monday quoted the letter as saying.
	   The Indonesian car plant assembled 1,450 vehicles this year,
compared to 7,625 in 1997.
	   Indonesia's worst economic crisis in decades was triggered last
year by the fall of Asian currencies. The regional financial
turmoil has hit especially hard in Indonesia, where millions of
people have lost their jobs and prices have soared.
	   The economy shrank as much as 16 percent this year and a full
recovery is expected to take years.

Skipper vows to never sail again
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MERIMBULA, Australia (AP) _ The skipper of sunk Sydney-Hobart
yacht Winston Churchill vowed Tuesday never to race again after the
deaths of his close friends in the terrible conditions that claimed
six lives.
	   ``I personally won't (race); my decision's pretty well made up
in that direction,'' the boat's owner and skipper Richard Winning
said.
	   The 56-year-old Winston Churchill, an entrant in the inaugural
1945 Sydney-Hobart classic, was abandoned on Sunday night and the
nine crew climbed into two life rafts.
	   Winning and three crewmates Paul Lumtin, Bruce Gould and Michael
Rynan on Monday night were winched to safety after 24 hours in a
life raft in huge Bass Strait seas.
	   On Tuesday they were told that three crewmen washed away from a
second liferaft _ Jim Lawler, Mike Bannister and John Dean _ were
all dead.
	   Winning said he had no doubt after their life raft was spotted
on Monday night by rescuers that all in the second craft would
survive.
	   ``When I went to bed I thought these blokes would be here
tonight, if not tomorrow morning,'' he said. ``Two of them have
been my mates since I was a young fella.
	   ``That's Michael Bannister and John Dean. I've been sailing with
those guys since I was a young child. It's shocking to lose your
mates like this.''
	   The wooden-hulled Winston Churchill, built in 1942 and competing
in the Sydney-Hobart race for the 16th time, was restored by
Winning about two years ago. (djp)

Report: Failed bank may have extended illegal dividends
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ A failed Japanese lender is suspected of violating
the law by offering stock dividends this year despite being warned
by the central bank it was in deep financial trouble, a news report
said Tuesday.
	   The Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan Ltd., which was recently
nationalized after being declared insolvent, announced it would
extend 7 billion yen (dlrs 60 million) in dividends at a
shareholders meeting in June, the Yomiuri newspaper reported.
	   The payments came shortly after the Bank of Japan had informed
LTCB that 70 percent of its 2.79 trillion yen (dlrs 24 billion) in
loans to affiliates had gone sour, placing the bank in danger of
collapsing, said the Yomiuri, Japan's largest daily.
	   The Financial Supervisory Agency says that the dividends may
have broken Japan's Commercial Code, which prohibits companies from
extending dividends in excess of their profits, the Yomiuri
reported.
	   The agency, which has been examining LTCB's books, said the
bank's shortage of reserves to cover potential loan losses and the
extent of its undeclared problem loans showed that the bank had no
profits at the time it offered the dividends.
	   Tokyo prosecutors and the Securities and Exchange Surveillance
Commission are reportedly questioning former LTCB executives about
the case. Officials connected with the investigation were
unavailable for comment.
	   The Yomiuri said that LTCB's June dividend payments for fiscal
1997 were equal to those it had extended the previous year.
Japanese companies have been known to be reluctant to slash
dividends out of concern for concealing their financial
difficulties.
	   The financial supervisory committee revealed in October that
LTCB had drastically understated the amount of its problem loans
before the government discovered the real state of its finances.
	   The government took over LTCB in October as part of its ongoing
efforts to mop up bad debts that have been crippling Japan's
banking system. The bank had liabilities exceeding assets by some
340 billion yen (2.93 billion).
	   LTCB became the first Japanese bank to be nationalized since the
end of World War II.

Chinese sentenced for printing, dealing in illegal political
</HEADLINE>
publications

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Moving to enforce a ban on publications deemed
politically suspect, Chinese authorities have sentenced several
groups of people to prison sentences of up to 13 years, the
official newspaper People's Daily reported Tuesday.
	   The longest sentences were handed to Wang Suozhu, of Hebei
province, near Beijing, and others convicted of publishing more
than 15,000 ``politically illegal'' items between October 1997 and
April, the report said.
	   Wang and the others were sentenced to jail terms of five to 13
years, and fined between 100,000 yuan and 200,000 yuan (dlrs
12,100-dlrs 24,200).
	   Cases in Beijing, Tianjin, to the east of Beijing, and the
central province of Hunan also resulted in prison sentences and
fines for those found responsible for buying or selling illegal
publications, the report said.
	   The report said only that the items in question had ``severe
political problems,'' without providing any details about the books
or magazines that had been banned.
	   Last week, the government announced a renewed campaign to impose
strict controls on the media and ban all items considered to be
obscene or politically unacceptable to the ruling Communist Party.
	   The campaign is part of a crackdown on dissent that in the past
two weeks has resulted in prison sentences of from 10 to 13 years
for dissidents associated with the China Democracy Party, whose
organizers had attempted to set up a legal opposition party.
	   As China approaches the 10th anniversary of the military
suppression of protests in Tiananmen Square and the 50th
anniversary of the founding of Communist China in 1949, the
government has stepped up efforts to enforce stability and prevent
unrest among the growing army of unemployed workers and other
disaffected groups.

Violators of foreign exchange laws to face harsh sentences
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Chinese courts can impose sentences of up to life
in prison for those found guilty of violating a newly revised
foreign exchange law, the state-run Xinhua News Agency reported
Tuesday.
	   A revision to the law adopted Tuesday by the top committee of
the National People's Congress stipulates a maximum sentence of
life imprisonment for major violations of foreign exchange
regulations, the report said.
	   Those convicted of purchasing foreign exchange using forged
documents, of evading payments or of engaging in illegal trading
activities could face the maximum penalty, it said without
describing previous penalties.
	   The revised law tightens enforcement of rules banning companies
from making illegal deposits or transfers of foreign exchange
abroad and it holds government and company officials liable to
criminal prosecution for allowing others to commit such offenses.
	   Those found guilty under the law may face fines of between 5
percent and 30 percent of the value of the illegal transactions,
Xinhua added.
	   China's currency, the yuan, is convertible only for trade and
related services. The government has been stepping up enforcement
of widely flouted currency controls to help ensure a stable
exchange rate and prevent companies and individuals from illegally
transfering funds overseas.
	   Police recently uncovered 232 cases of illegal currency deals
involving the equivalent of more than dlrs 8.8 billion, many of
which involved the use of forged documents, the newspaper Legal
Daily reported Tuesday.
	   The report said the police had recently established an economic
crimes investigation unit to deal with such cases.

Shielded from trial, Khmer Rouge leaders meet premier with smiles

hair dyed, other details &QL;

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Two top Khmer Rouge leaders long
wanted for genocide were greeted with handshakes and smiles by
Prime Minister Hun Sen at a military base Tuesday after he defied
growing pressure and pledged not to put them on trial.
	   Khieu Samphan and Nuon Chea, key members of the inner circle of
late Khmer Rouge chieftain Pol Pot, were flown by helicopter from a
former rebel stronghold to Hun Sen's heavily guarded residence on a
base outside the capital.
	   Khieu Samphan, 67, needed help walking up stairs. His normally
white hair was dyed black in an apparent attempt at disguise during
his months on the run as Khmer Rouge territory fell under
government control.
	   Laughing and joking, Hun Sen told Khieu Samphan not to worry
about a throng of journalists, most of whom were kept at bay.
	   ``I told journalists all about this yesterday at a Cabinet
meeting, so I don't need to make a lot of comment,'' Hun Sen said.
	   They posed for pictures with Ieng Sary, a Khmer Rouge leader who
was pardoned in 1996 for his role in genocide in exchange for
making peace with the government and leading thousands of
guerrillas out of a stalemated civil war.
	   In exchange for officially ending their part in the war _ all
but over for more than a year anyway _ Hun Sen said he would not
try Khieu Samphan or Nuon Chea for the deaths of as many as 2
million people.
	   ``If we bring them to trial, it will not benefit the nation, it
will only mean a return to civil war,'' Hun Sen said Monday. ``We
should dig a hole and bury the past and look toward the future.''
	   Khieu Samphan and Nuon Chea have been sheltered for several days
in Pailin, an ex-rebel stronghold nominally under government
control run by Ieng Sary.
	   It was Nuon Chea's first visit to the capital since the Khmer
Rouge were overthrown in 1979 by a Vietnamese invasion. Khieu
Samphan came to the capital in 1991 after a peace treaty _ later
broken by the Khmer Rouge _ was signed. He was stoned by a Hun
Sen-controlled mob.
	   In the past two years, granting pardons to Khmer Rouge leaders
broke the back of their guerrilla war and gave Cambodia its best
hope in decades of rebuilding. But now, calls are rising for
someone to be held accountable.
	   The Maoist revolutionaries won a civil war in 1975 and forced
Cambodians into slave labor camps. About one person in five
perished from overwork, starvation, disease and executions.
	   Under heavy guard, Khieu Samphan, Nuon Chea and Ieng Sary lifted
off from the Pailin police station for the two-hour flight to
Takhmau, a Phnom Penh suburb where Hun Sen lives on a base dubbed
the ``Tiger's Lair.'' They were accompanied by their families.
	   Leading members of the Cambodian People's Party _ led by those
who, like Hun Sen, were once Khmer Rouge cadres before fleeing
bloody purges _ joined the meeting.
	   Khieu Samphan was the Khmer Rouge's nominal leader, though it is
debatable how much influence he had. Pol Pot and other leaders
guarded their identities and were rarely seen in public, preferring
to send Khieu Samphan to speak for them.
	   Nuon Chea was regarded as second-in-command and chief political
theorist. There is extensive evidence of his role in mass
executions of party members suspected of treason.
	   Former members of the inner circle who have defected tend to
place all blame on Pol Pot, who died in April of a heart attack.
	   Only one guerrilla leader remains at large: Ta Mok, known as
``The Butcher,'' is somewhere on the Thai border with no more than
100 die-hard loyalists. They pose no threat.
	   Though Hun Sen clearly said there would be no trial, government
spokesman Khieu Kanharith tried Tuesday to leave open the chances
of submitting a case to an international tribunal or local courts.
	   ``Once it is determined by the court, local or international,
who is responsible for the genocide, then we can move forward,''
Khieu Kanharith said.
	   The chaotic Cambodian judicial system is not independent.
	   Youk Chhang, director of a center that gathers evidence of the
genocide, hoped Hun Sen was playing a game to lure the pair into
custody.
	   ``The circumstances may have forced him to say something like
this,'' Youk Chhang said, urging the United States and other
countries to temper calls for a trial and give Hun Sen maneuvering
room.

Sharon says he may run for prime minister
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israeli Foreign Minister Ariel Sharon has said
he has not ruled out running for prime minister if ``special
reasons'' arise that require his candidacy for the elections on May
17.
	   The popular hawk in the ruling Likud Party did not say if he
might run against Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in party
primaries at the end of January or could form his own slate.
	   Hardliner Uzi Landau had thus far been the only candidate in the
party to emerge as a competitor with Netanyahu and polls showed he
had little chance to beat the premier.
	   Although Sharon told the Likud central committee Sunday evening
he did ``not want to be prime minister,'' he said he may run on
Channel Two television Monday night.
	   ``There is a difference between I don't want to be prime
minister and (I may run) for special reasons,'' Sharon said.
	   Sharon did not specify his intentions. But there was speculation
he could throw his hat in the ring if Netanyahu's popularity drops
or key leaders abandon the Likud party as they have hinted they
might.
	   Sharon resigned his post as defense minister in 1983 after he
was held indirectly responsible for the massacre of hundreds of
Palestinians during Israel's military offensive to chase PLO
guerrillas out of Lebanon.
	   Since then and until he was named foreign minister three months
ago, Sharon served only in second-rank posts despite his
popularity.
	   The Likud and the opposition Labor Party agreed Monday that
elections would be held on May 17 after the parliament gave intial
approval last week to a bill for early elections. An expected
second round would be held on June 1.
	   Recent polls have shown that Netanyahu would not receive enough
votes to win a first round.
	   The surveys revealed also that Netanyahu would lose in a second
vote against either Labor leader Ehud Barak or Amnon Lipkin-Shahak,
a former chief of staff who is expected to announce his candidacy
at the head of a newly-formed centrist party.

	   HOBART, Australia (AP) _ U.S. billionaire Larry Ellison,
teary-eyed after battling through deadly waves kicked up by a storm
in the Sydney-to-Hobart yacht race, said he said he had never
experienced worse conditions at sea.
	   Ellison, the founder and chief executive of computer giant
Oracle, won his second Sydney-to-Hobart race but arrived in Hobart
early Tuesday to a funereal atmosphere.
	   Asked if he'd come back again, Ellison said, ``My first reaction
is not if I live to a thousand years. But who knows?''
	   ``It was just awful, I've never experienced anything remotely
like this,'' Ellison said. ``It's been a very emotional experience
to get here. This is not what this is supposed to be about. A lot
of us are upset.''
	   Ellison said it was an extraordinarily difficult journey as his
yacht battled ``right through the eye of a hurricane'' and his crew
heard by radio of the deaths in the battered fleet.
	   Sayonara finished the race in two days, 20 hours, three minutes
and 32 seconds, but missing the record time was irrelevant to the
shaken crew, which included media magnate Rupert Murdoch's son
Lachlan.
	   ``Guys were knocked down time and time again, but kept getting
up to do what had to be done to keep us alive,'' Ellison said.
``It's a tough crew, but the guys were choked up. We were learning
of people dying.''
	   At least five sailors have died and another is missing, presumed
drowned, in the worst tragedy to hit the race in its 54-year
history.
	   Sayonara crossed the finishing line to a subdued welcome by a
smaller-than-usual spectator fleet and dockside crowd. The 23-man
crew aboard the maxi were safe, except for one who had a broken
ankle.
	   A welcome celebration was postponed and the trophy presentation
was delayed until January 2.
	   ``That's as tough as it gets,'' said Sayonara's helmsman Chris
Dickson. ``Being here first is nice but being here at all is a big
thing and we're thinking about those who are still out there, not
thinking too much about how we've done.''
	   New Zealander Dickson, who said he has experienced similar
conditions in the Whitbread Around the World race, was unsure if he
would attempt this event again.
	   ``Anyone who is not scared in those conditions is not human,''
Dickson said. ``For a long time in Bass Strait we were not racing.
Nor was anyone else.''
	   Murdoch, chief executive of family-owned Australian newspaper
Business News Limited, said the race was a great tragedy which the
crew was still trying to absorb.
	   ``Everyone here is very saddened and it gives you mixed feelings
about being part of it all,'' Murdoch said.

Sharon says he may run for prime minister
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israeli Foreign Minister Ariel Sharon has said
he has not ruled out running for prime minister if ``special
reasons'' arise that require his candidacy for the elections on May
17.
	   The popular hawk in the ruling Likud Party did not say if he
might run against Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in party
primaries at the end of January or could form his own slate.
	   Hard-liner Uzi Landau has been the only candidate in the party
to emerge as a competitor. Polls show he has little chance to beat
the premier.
	   Although Sharon told the Likud central committee Sunday evening
that he did ``not want to be prime minister,'' he said he may run
on Channel Two television Monday night.
	   ``There is a difference between I don't want to be prime
minister and (I may run) for special reasons,'' Sharon said.
	   Sharon did not specify his intentions. There was speculation he
could enter the race if Netanyahu's popularity drops or key leaders
abandon the Likud party.
	   Sharon resigned his post as defense minister in 1983 after he
was held indirectly responsible for the massacre of hundreds of
Palestinians during Israel's military offensive to chase PLO
guerrillas out of Lebanon. Later, he served only in second-rank
posts despite his popularity.
	   The Likud and the opposition Labor Party agreed Monday that
elections would be held on May 17 after the parliament gave initial
approval last week to a bill for early elections. An expected
second round would be held June 1.
	   Recent polls have shown Netanyahu would not receive enough votes
to win a first round.
	   The surveys revealed also that Netanyahu would lose in a second
vote against either Labor leader Ehud Barak or Amnon Lipkin-Shahak,
a former chief of staff who is expected to announce his candidacy
at the head of a newly formed centrist party.

Navy pilot taken back in time during yacht rescue
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By BENJAMIN PEDLEY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MERIMBULA, Australia (AP) _ Navy pilot Tanzi Lea peered down
into mountainous seas and was carried back 20 years to the 1979
Fastnet race where 15 sailors perished.
	   Lea was the pilot of a navy Sea King helicopter which hauled two
dead sailors out of Bass Strait Tuesday, bringing the death toll
from the Sydney-to-Hobart race to five confirmed with one other
presumed drowned.
	   Lea was a member of Britain's Royal Navy during the Fastnet
rescue off the southwest coast of Ireland where only 85 yachts
finished out of 303 starters because of high winds and punishing
waves.
	   ``The seas were as big as I saw during rescues in the Fastnet
race 20 years ago,'' Lea told The Associated Press after arriving
back with the two bodies Tuesday. ``Under those circumstances
you've got to be careful and act prudently.''
	   Lea, now with the Australian navy, was involved throughout the
search and rescue process. He said the weather was at its worst
Monday and Sunday but had calmed considerably by the time his
helicopter reached the bodies Tuesday.
	   ``A big depression formed quickly and although a change was
expected I don't think people thought it would be this bad,'' Lea
said.
	   The two dead men were believed to be from the veteran cutter
Winston Churchill. Another crew member is missing while six others
were carried to safety.
	   Two of the men saved were in a life raft which had its bottom
torn away by heavy seas. A wave knocked their three mates out of
reach.
	   Shane Pashley, a navy diver, reached the two crew members who
had managed to hang onto the remnants of their life raft.
	   ``We winched the first guy up who was absolutely exhausted, the
waves were crashing over the top of the raft which made it very
difficult as I was continually dragged under the water,'' Pashley
told the Associated Press.
	   ``Once we'd winched him up we put him on the floor of the
aircraft and turned the heaters up because he was suffering from
exposure,'' Pashley said.
	   The harness was sent down for the second survivor but it snagged
on the life raft. He was eventually hauled aboard the helicopter.
	   ``One bloke said he knew where the other guys were but we
couldn't do anything as we were nearly out of fuel,'' Pashley said.
``They were just really tired and very thirsty, one of the guys was
only wearing a spray jacket and shorts.''
	   Pashley, like most Australians, has vivid memories of the rescue
of English yachtsman Tony Bullimore, who showed unrestrained joy
after being found following four days alone at sea in early 1997.
	   But there was no great sense of celebration for Pashley.
	   ``There were no Tony Bullimore-style kisses,'' he said. ``They
were just done.''

Two police stations burned in Indonesia protest
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ At least 800 people burned two police
stations on Indonesia's Sumatra island during a protest against the
death in detention of a fellow villager, police said Tuesday.
	   Nine policemen and at least two villagers were injured in the
clash Monday in Liwa, 300 kilometers (187 miles) northwest of
Jakarta, the Indonesian capital. Officers fired warning shots to
disperse stone-throwing rioters who attacked a third police post.
	   Meanwhile, calm returned Tuesday to the Sulawesi island town of
Poso after fighting between mobs that was triggered by weekend
brawls involving gangs of youths.
	   At least 150 people were injured in the clashes Monday, said Dr.
Abram, a physician at the local hospital in Poso.
	   Troops patrolled the debris-strewn streets of Poso and security
was also tight in the Sumatra town of Deli Serdang, where police
firing plastic bullets injured six people Monday during a protest
by peasants over land rights.
	   The violence in Liwa broke out after the death of a villager who
had been detained for questioning in a robbery case.
	   A preliminary autopsy indicated that Sanin committed suicide,
police chief Lt. Col. Tri Parnoyo Kartiko said by telephone.
	   However, rumors spread that police had killed the villager and
residents took to the streets in protest. They were also angry over
the detention of another man in the same case.
	   Mired in its worst economic crisis in decades, Indonesia endured
numerous riots this year as ethnic, political and religious
tensions rose.
	   The unrest reached a peak in May shortly before the ouster of
authoritarian President Suharto after 32 years in power. Some 1,200
people died in riots in Jakarta.

Dollar lower against yen, Japanese stocks higher in Tokyo
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with closing stocks, mid afternoon dollar, bond, other
details

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The U.S. dollar was lower against the yen Tuesday
in thin year-end trading, as investors took profits and some grew
bearish about the outlook for the U.S. economy. Japanese stock
prices rose.
	   The dollar bought 115.42 yen at mid afternoon, down 0.70 yen
from late Monday in Tokyo and also below its late New York level of
115.90 yen overnight.
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average gained 137.84
points, or 1.01 percent, to close at 13,846.90. On Monday, the
average fell 88.89 points, or 0.64 percent.
	   In currency dealings, the dollar dipped as traders locked in
profits on the U.S. currency, which was boosted earlier in the
session by commercial demand and news of renewed tension between
the United States and Iraq, traders said.
	   Many Japanese institutional investors were also growing jittery
about the possibility that America's long economic boom may be
running out of steam.
	   ``The number of dollar bears who see the U.S. economy slowing
down next year is increasing among Japanese institutional investors
and interbank players,'' said Shuji Takano, assistant manager of
foreign exchange at ABN AMRO Bank.
	   The dollar was supported in early Tokyo trading and also
overnight in New York on news that U.S. warplanes fired missiles
Monday at an Iraqi air defense site in the northern part of the
country.
	   The attack came two days after Baghdad announced it would fire
at Western aircraft patrolling the no-fly zones over northern and
southern Iraq.
	   The U.S. dollar is considered a safe haven in times of
international unrest.
	   On the stock market, share prices gained in a late surge on
futures-led buying. Trading was thin as many participants have
taken off for the New Year holidays.
	   In New York, the Dow Jones industrial average rose 8.76 points
to 9,226.75 at Monday's close.
	   Many investors also took to the sidelines to await developments
in a proposed coalition deal between Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi's
Liberal Democratic Party and the opposition Liberal Party.
	   The two sides were expected to seal a pact this week that would
boost the LDP's leverage in Parliament, but last-minute
disagreements caused negotiations to stall.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section gained 8.94 points, 0.83 percent, to 1,088.83. The
TOPIX closed down 3.07 points, or 0.28 percent, the day before.
	   The yield on the benchmark No. 203 10-year Japanese government
bond rose to 1.865 percent from Monday's close at 1.685 percent,
driving its price down to 99.47 yen from 100.93 yen.

Pak turns into a tiger on LPGA Tour
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DOUG FERGUSON &QC; 
 &UR; AP Golf Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ They have the same dynamic smile, the same knack
for winning a major championship in unforgettable fashion. They
both were trained in unorthodox manners by fathers obsessed with
them becoming a champion.
	   Se Ri Pak and Tiger Woods now share something else in common.
	   Pak, the South Korean rookie who won two majors and took women's
golf to its highest level of popularity in 20 years, on Tuesday was
named Associated Press Female Athlete of the Year in a close vote
over Tennessee basketball star Chamique Holdsclaw.
	   The award comes one year after Woods became the first golfer in
26 years to win the Male Athlete of the Year.
	   ``Nineteen-ninety-eight is very special for me,'' Pak said. ``I
cannot forget this season.''
	   Pak received 19 first-place votes and 156 points in voting by AP
member newspaper and broadcast outlets. Holdsclaw, the top player
on what many regard as the best women's college basketball team
ever, got 142 points.
	   Tara Lipinski, who won the Olympic gold medal in figure skating,
was third with 105 points. Sprinter and long jumper Marion Jones,
undefeated in every event this year, was fourth with 101 points,
followed by U.S. Open tennis champion Lindsay Davenport.
	   Holdsclaw (27), Lipinksi (21) and Jones (24) all had more
first-place votes than Pak, but Pak was named on 85 of the 147
ballots, far more than anyone else.
	   Pak became the first golfer since Beth Daniel in 1990 to win
Female Athlete of the Year, and the first rookie golfer since Nancy
Lopez in 1978.
	   Not since Lopez won five straight tournaments and nine events in
her rookie season has women's golf exploded onto front pages.
	   ``What we could not have anticipated was the emergence of Se Ri
Pak,'' said LPGA commissioner Jim Ritts. ``It was one of those
stories that captured interest and imagination. It really elevated
our visibility.''
	   And it all happened in a span of about 10 weeks.
	   Pak, who spent a year working with David Leadbetter to get her
game in shape for America, didn't even finish in the top 10 in any
of her first nine starts until winning the LPGA Championship in May
with three rounds in the 60s on a soggy, long course.
	   Six weeks later, she put her stamp on stardom in the U.S.
Women's Open with a captivating duel involving 20-year-old amateur
Jenny Chuasiriporn.
	   Pak rallied from a four-stroke deficit in the 18-hole playoff,
but ran into trouble on the 18th hole of Blackwolf Run when her
drive stopped on the bank of a creek down the left side. After
studying her options, she waded calf-deep into the water, chipped
out across the fairway and salvaged bogey.
	   Chuasiriporn missed a 10-foot par putt to send the playoffs into
extra holes. Pak won on the 92nd hole _ the longest tournament in
LPGA history _ with an 18-foot birdie putt, then broke down in
tears as her father embraced her.
	   ``First time I cry in my life,'' she said.
	   She became the youngest Women's Open champion and the first
rookie since Juli Inkster in 1984 to win two majors in one year.
Those were the only two tournaments Inkster won that year.
	   Pak followed up her second major by setting two LPGA scoring
records a week later _ a 61 in the second round of the Jamie Farr
Kroger Classic, and a 261 over 72 holes for her third victory.
	   Two weeks later, she won again, beating Dottie Pepper down the
stretch in the Giant Eagle Classic.
	   Pakmania was born.
	   ``I always expected great things of her, but there's no way
anyone could have foreseen the things she did,'' Leadbetter said.
``She a special girl and a great talent. She exciting, and she's
given the LPGA a breath of fresh air as Tiger has done for the
men's tour.''
	   But Woods' arrival had been anticipated for years, especially
having appeared on talk shows at age 2, winning every junior title
around and becoming the first player to win the U.S. Amateur three
years in a row.
	   Pak didn't pick up a club until she was 14, but was trained like
few others.
	   While Earl Woods used to jingle coins in his pocket to teach his
son focus, Jun-Chul Pak adopted more bizarre methods. He made Pak
walk the stairs in their apartment forward and backward to build
strength in her legs.
	   He made her spend the night in a cemetery to help her conquer
fear. And he took her to pit bull fights to make her mentally
tough.
	   ``People say I look focused,'' Pak said. ``Sometimes I don't
have nice face. Sometimes poker face.''
	   But she wasn't a robot, either.
	   Her struggle with English was compensated with a megawatt smile
she could turn on like a switch. She developed a friendship with
Lopez, her idol, and giggled like a schoolgirl whenever she won a
hole in a skins game during practice rounds.
	   ``She has a lot of pressure to be the next superstar, and she
could be if you let her,'' Lopez said.
	   Pak was treated like one. Before long, galleries swarmed to see
her in much the same way they were drawn to Woods. Unlike other
LPGA stars, Pak thrived under the spotlight.
	   ``They feel like friends,'' Pak said. ``They make big loud.''
	   With two major championships, two scoring records and a rookie
season that women's golf hasn't seen in 20 years, Pak made the
biggest loud of all.

Mark McGwire: AP Male Athlete of the Year
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By BEN WALKER &QC; 
 &UR; AP Baseball Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Mark McGwire's home runs did more than win games
for the St. Louis Cardinals. Those 70 big swings won back fans for
the whole sport.
	   For setting a record that may outlast him, and for helping save
the game of baseball, Big Mac was picked Monday as The Associated
Press Male Athlete of the Year.
	   ``It's America's pastime. And if took one person to help get it
back on the map, and people say it's me, that's great,'' McGwire
said.
	   In a season considered by many to be the greatest ever, the
6-foot-5 redhead stood tallest of them all. From his grand slam on
opening day to No. 70 on his final swing, McGwire captivated the
nation.
	   ``Did he hit one?'' became the daily buzzwords among millions of
fans and nonfans alike, especially as his riveting race with Sammy
Sosa heated up near the end of the season.
	   And then came the best snapshot of them all: the night he hit
No. 62 in St. Louis to break Roger Maris' 37-year-old record. After
rounding the bases, an exuberant McGwire lifted his son, Matt, in a
bear hug, embraced Sosa, whose Chicago Cubs happened to be playing
against him, and then saluted the Maris family that was on hand to
witness history.
	   That September evening at Busch Stadium, with fireworks
exploding overhead and cheers coming from all around the globe, it
seemed like baseball had _ at last _ broken free from its
post-strike problems.
	   McGwire easily won the Male Athlete of the Year award with 332
points. Sosa was second with 177 in the annual voting by AP member
newspapers and broadcast outlets. Ten points are allotted for every
first-place vote, nine for second and so on.
	   Running back Terrell Davis of the Super Bowl champion Denver
Broncos was third with 63 points, Michael Jordan of the NBA
champion Chicago Bulls was next with 54, followed by Broncos
quarterback John Elway (50) and NASCAR driver Jeff Gordon (42).
	   This marked the second straight time the AP's top male athlete
was the subject of the AP's Story of the Year. In 1997, Tiger Woods
won the individual award while his victory in the Masters earned
Story of the Year honors.
	   From the day he homered in the Cardinals' spring training opener
to the night he scooped up a foul ball as a guest in a front-row
box at the final game of the World Series, McGwire was the focus of
baseball.
	   The slugging first baseman was expected to challenge Maris' 1961
mark of 61, especially because this was an expansion season, when
offensive numbers tend to get out of whack.
	   McGwire delivered with 29,598 feet worth of longballs, most of
them moonshots far beyond the fences. He became the first player to
hit at least 50 home runs in three straight seasons.
	   McGwire punctuated each drive with his signature _ a fake punch
to the gut of teammates.
	   ``Americans love power,'' McGwire said. ``Big cars. Big trucks.
Big people. Baseball fans have always been drawn to the home run
and the guy throwing close to 100 mph.''
	   McGwire finished with 147 RBIs and an NL-record 162 walks. He
led the majors in slugging percentage (.752) and on-base percentage
(.470) and batted .299.
	   Sosa, however, won the NL MVP award when the Cubs won the
wild-card spot while the Cardinals did not make the playoffs.
	   McGwire's shots earned him standing ovations in opposing
ballparks. Along the way, there were a few bumps.
	   In early June, back spasms caused him to miss a few games and
raised concern that his history of injuries would stall his bid.
Later, with so much attention put on his monstrous batting practice
shows, he said he felt like ``a caged animal'' and said he might
cut down his BP sessions.
	   The biggest controversy of all came in August when the AP
reported that he used androstenedione, an over-the-counter
muscle-building supplement that is banned by the NFL, Olympics and
NCAA.
	   ``Everybody that I know in the game of baseball uses the same
stuff I use,'' McGwire said.
	   Then on Sept. 8, in the Cardinals' 145th game, Big Mac broke the
homer mark _ without a doubt or the kind of asterisk that dogged
Maris when he passed Babe Ruth.
	   No. 62 was a line drive off the Cubs' Steve Trachsel that barely
made it over the left-field fence. At 341 feet, it was McGwire's
shortest homer of the season.
	   McGwire was so excited he ran past first and had to retouch the
bag. He got handshakes and pats from every Chicago infielder, then
saved his biggest celebration for his 10-year-old batboy son at
home plate; for Sosa, who jogged in from right field; and for the
Maris family.
	   ``I have been talking about this since January,'' McGwire said.
``I can honestly say I did it.''
	   Sosa eventually tied McGwire at 66 home runs. McGwire, however,
won the race by finishing his season with a pair of two-homer
games. His shot off Montreal's Carl Pavano in the seventh inning on
the last day gave him the beyond-belief total of 70.
	   ``I think it will stand for a while,'' McGwire said. ``Will it
be broken someday? It could be. Will I be alive? Possibly.''

Doctor: Police use `questionable' procedures in DNA tests
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with doctor saying Sukma did not appear to have been
recently sodomized; CORRECTS thruout to Dr. Zahari Noor, with Noor
as surname, sted Vahari; NOTE sensitive language in last two grafs.
 &UR; By ALVIN UNG &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Police used ``highly
questionable'' procedures in collecting DNA samples from sacked
Deputy Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim, a state doctor testified
Tuesday in Anwar's sex and corruption trial.
	   Dr. Zahari Noor, a forensic expert at the state-run General
Hospital, the prosecution's 20th witness, testified that he took
blood samples from Anwar on Sept. 28th.
	   Anwar was at police headquarters, eight days after his arrest.
He agreed to give blood samples that were to be tested for the HIV
virus, hepatitis and venereal disease, Noor said.
	   Anwar was fired by Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad on Sept. 2,
after Mahathir deemed him morally unfit to lead the country. He is
on trial for abuse of power and will be tried separately on charges
of engaging in illegal sex acts, including sodomy.
	   Anwar has denied all the accusations against him, saying they
were trumped up to eliminate his challenge to Mahathir's 17-year
rule.
	   Noor testified Tuesday that Anwar never gave permission for his
blood to be used for a DNA test. He said police demanded the blood
more than two months later so they could test his DNA.
	   Defense attorney Christopher Fernando asked whether the blood
would still suitable for DNA testing.
	   ``The results of the DNA testing done on this sample would be
highly questionable,'' Noor said. ``The blood being sent after
about two and one-half months ... is an inordinate delay by any
standard.''
	   Noor said the blood cells containing the DNA would have perished
because no anti-clotting chemicals had been added to Anwar's
original blood samples.
	   When the prosecution went back to Noor, however, he conceded
``it's possible to obtain DNA from a substantially degraded blood
sample.''
	   On Monday, Dr. Halim Haji Manzar, a pathologist at General
Hospital, testified that the blood taken from Anwar was given
directly to police and they never had a chance to test it for
sexually transmitted diseases.
	   The prosecution was expected to put state DNA experts on the
stand to testify that DNA samples taken from Anwar matched those of
semen stains found on a mattress in an apartment where Anwar
allegedly carried on sexual trysts.
	   The defense, anticipating this tactic, is trying to show the
judge that at no time did Anwar give permission for his blood to be
tested for DNA. Defense attorneys Monday implied that hair and
semen samples may have been taken from Anwar while he was
unconscious after his beating in police custody.
	   Fernando on Tuesday also popped a question that led to strenuous
prosecution objection, which was overruled by trial judge Augustine
Paul.
	   He asked Noor: ``When you examined Sukma Darmawan, you found
that he had no homosexual history when you conducted an anal test
on him?''
	   Sukma, Anwar's adopted brother, was sentenced to six months in
jail on Sept. 19 after confessing that he allowed Anwar to sodomize
him in April. Homosexuality is a crime in this predominantly Muslim
nation.
	   Sukma, currently out on bail, says he was mentally and
physically abused by police and coerced into making a guilty plea,
which he is now appealing.
	   Noor testified that he examined Sukma on Sept. 9 and determined
there was no evidence of anal intercourse.
	   ``He denied any history of homosexual activity,'' Noor said.
``When I examined his private parts there was no evidence of
injuries, whether recent or old.''

 &UR; Eds: ADDS late game; DELETES erroneous career total for Carkner in
 &UR; Devils 7, Sabres 4 &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BUFFALO, New York (AP) _ Buffalo goalie Dominik Hasek had a rare
bad game, and the New Jersey Devils made the most of it with a 7-4
victory over the Sabres on Monday night.
	   Two nights after being shut out by the two-time Hart Trophy
winner, the Devils scored on each of their first three shots and
put four of six past Hasek.
	   Krzysztof Oliwa, Brendan Morrison, Petr Sykora and Dave
Andreychuk scored to give the Devils a 4-1 lead and oust Hasek just
22 seconds into the second. Hasek hadn't allowed three goals in the
first period of a game since a 3-1 loss to the Devils on Dec. 24,
1997.
	   The Devils lost to the Sabres 2-0 in the first game of the
home-and-home series Saturday night as Hasek made 34 saves. New
Jersey has won seven of eight against the Sabres.
	   Hasek hadn't allowed a goal in 163 minutes, 35 seconds.
 &UR; Capitals 5, Bruins 1 &QC; 
	   At Washington, Peter Bondra, Ken Klee and Sergei Gonchar scored
first-period goals as the Washington Capitals returned home from
the longest road trip in team history and beat the Boston Bruins.
	   The Capitals, who scored only 11 goals while going 2-6 on their
three-week trip, notched three goals on 18 shots _ the most they
have taken during an opening period this season.
	   Only seven minor penalties and two majors were called, a stark
contrast to the fight-filled meeting between the two teams on Nov.
21 _ a 5-4 overtime triumph by Boston at the Fleet Center.
 &UR; Blues 4, Red Wings 4 &QC; 
	   At Detroit, Vyacheslav Kozlov scored two goals that counted and
two that didn't as the Detroit Red Wings snapped a five-game losing
streak _ their longest since January 1991.
	   Kozlov's second goal forged the tie with 9:13 remaining,
bringing Detroit back from a 4-2 deficit in the second period. He
also had two apparent scores wiped out by video review, and took a
penalty that negated a teammate's goal _ all in the first period.
	   Steve Yzerman and Kris Draper scored the other Detroit goals.
	   Chris Pronger had two goals and an assist for the Blues, who
also got goals from Michal Handzus and Scott Pellerin. St. Louis is
winless (0-5-5) in its last 10 road games.
 &UR; Mighty Ducks 2, Senators 2 &QC; 
	   At Kanata, Ontario, Shawn McEachern's second goal of the game
and team-leading 15th this season _ with six seconds left in
regulation _ gave the Ottawa Senators a tie with the Anaheim Mighty
Ducks.
	   McEachern sent the game into overtime by burying a rebound past
Anaheim goalie Dominic Roussel. McEachern also beat Roussel on the
first shot of the game, but the Anaheim goalie then shut the door
until the final seconds.
	   Frederik Olausson and Marty McInnis scored for the Ducks, as
Ottawa outshot Anaheim 39-16. The Ducks were coming off six days'
rest and had lost only one of their previous eight.
 &UR; Panthers 5, Islanders 1 &QC; 
	   At Sunrise, Florida, defensemen Paul Laus and Terry Carkner
scored rare goals as Florida beat the New York Islanders for the
Panthers' fourth victory in the last five games.
	   Oleg Kvasha, Ray Whitney and Carkner all had a goal and an
assist, while Viktor Kozlov added three assists to help Florida
climb over .500 (13-12-6) for the first time since Nov. 12.
	   Carkner scored his first goal in 66 games to give the Panthers a
1-0 lead at 4:53 of the first period. Laus scored his first since
April 6, 1996 _ a span of 188 games _ to increase Florida's lead to
3-0 at 4:40 of the second. It was his sixth career goal.
	   Panthers goalie Sean Burke stopped 26 shots for his fifth
victory in seven games (5-1-1).
 &UR; Stars 1, Predators 0 &QC; 
	   At Dallas, Shawn Chambers scored the only goal, and Ed Belfour
made 14 saves as the Dallas Stars remained unbeaten in 12 games to
match a franchise record.
	   Belfour got his third shutout of the season and 43rd of his
career as the Stars bettered their unbeaten run to 9-0-3. The Stars
are in the midst of their longest unbeaten string since the
Minnesota North Stars went 9-0-3 from Feb. 18-March 15, 1982.
	   Defenseman Chambers scored midway through the second period for
the Stars, who haven't lost since Dec. 4 at Vancouver.
 &UR; Kings 4, Coyotes 2 &QC; 
	   At Phoenix, Luc Robitaille scored twice _ including the
game-winner with 8:48 remaining _ and added an assist as the Los
Angeles Kings beat Phoenix to end the Coyotes' 11-game home
unbeaten streak.
	   Jozef Stumpel also scored a pair of goals for the resurgent
Kings (11-21-3), who have won three of their last four games.
	   Rick Tocchet and Daniel Briere scored for the Coyotes, now
10-2-1 at home. Phoenix had not lost on home since dropping its
opener Oct. 11 to Ottawa.
 &UR; Sharks 1, Flyers 1 &QC; 
	   At San Jose, California, Mike Vernon and John Vanbiesbrouck each
stopped 22 shots as San Jose and Philadelphia skated to a tie.
	   Philadelphia extended its unbeaten streak to eight (4-0-4),
while the Sharks stretched their unbeaten string to five (4-0-1).
	   Eric Lindros broke a scoreless tie with his 19th goal, on a
power play, at 4:19 of the the second. The Sharks, fourth in the
league in penalty killing at home with a 90.7 percentage entering
the game, had killed off 32 consecutive power plays before the
score.
	   Joe Murphy tied the game for the Sharks with his eighth goal of
the season at 11:31 of the second period.

Skipper vows to never sail again
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDs: clarifies that only five confirmed dead &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MERIMBULA, Australia (AP) _ The skipper of sunk Sydney-Hobart
yacht Winston Churchill vowed Tuesday never to race again after the
deaths of his close friends in the terrible conditions that claimed
five lives and left another sailor missing and presumed drowned.
	   ``I personally won't (race); my decision's pretty well made up
in that direction,'' the boat's owner and skipper Richard Winning
said.
	   The 56-year-old Winston Churchill, an entrant in the inaugural
1945 Sydney-Hobart classic, was abandoned on Sunday night and the
nine crew climbed into two life rafts.
	   Winning and three crewmates Paul Lumtin, Bruce Gould and Michael
Rynan on Monday night were winched to safety after 24 hours in a
life raft in huge Bass Strait seas.
	   On Tuesday they were told that two of the three crewmen washed
away from a second liferaft _ Jim Lawler, Mike Bannister and John
Dean _ were dead and that the third was missing and presumed
drowned.
	   Winning said he had no doubt after their life raft was spotted
on Monday night by rescuers that all in the second craft would
survive.
	   ``When I went to bed I thought these blokes would be here
tonight, if not tomorrow morning,'' he said. ``Two of them have
been my mates since I was a young fella.
	   ``That's Michael Bannister and John Dean. I've been sailing with
those guys since I was a young child. It's shocking to lose your
mates like this.''
	   The wooden-hulled Winston Churchill, built in 1942 and competing
in the Sydney-Hobart race for the 16th time, was restored by
Winning about two years ago. (djp)

Taiwan government hopes to boost property market
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ The cabinet plans to create tax incentives
and other measures to prop up Taiwan's property market, where the
effects of a 7-year slump have worsened amid the recent economic
slowdown, officials said Tuesday.
	   Details of the strategy will be announced Thursday, but the
package also will include loans to boost buying sentiment and other
measures to reduce construction, government spokesman Chen
Chien-jen said.
	   A task force will also be set up to study financial aid to
troubled real estate companies, he said.
	   Property developers _ also hard-hit by a credit crunch _ have
requested a government bailout.
	   The property slump has left an estimated 800,000 housing units
vacant throughout Taiwan, idling assets that cost developers at
least 1 trillion Taiwan dollars (U.S. dlrs 31 billion).
	   In hopes of shoring up profits, property developers have
purchased large land tracts, but many of the large-scale housing
projects were ill-devised or built in remote areas.
	   Officials said they have rejected a request by developers to set
up a government fund to purchase the homes, saying it would
encourage them to build more.
	   Instead, they said, the government will suspend some public
housing projects, reduce real estate transfer taxes, and provide
low-interest housing loans.
	   Bankers have said they fear Taiwan's economic problems could
worsen if property prices collapse because some 40 percent of bank
loans are collateralized with real estate.
	   The main index of Taiwan's stock market dipped slightly on
Tuesday, following a 3 percent plunge on Monday that pushed it to a
three-month low. Dealers attributed the fall to banks selling
construction shares on gloomy prospects for the sector.
	   The selling almost wiped out the gains from a government-led
effort to boost the market with the establishment last month of an
intervention fund of 283 billion Taiwan dollars (U.S. dlrs 8.7
billion).
	   Dealers said there was a continued lack of confidence that the
government's intervention fund could boost the market against a
lackluster economy, driven down primarily by fallen exports.

Citing better security, Japan eases travel restrictions in Egypt
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan has eased restriction on tours in Egypt,
citing the effectiveness of security measures taken by the Egyptian
government since a terrorist attack last year, the Foreign Ministry
said Tuesday.
	   Japanese travel agencies have restricted their tours in Egypt
since nearly a dozen Japanese tourists were killed in one of the
deadliest terrorist attacks ever at the Temple city of Luxor on
Nov. 17, last year.
	   The measures have been in effect for Japanese travelers to three
Egyptian cities _ Luxor, Aswan and Abu Simbel.
	   In all, 58 foreigners, including 35 Swiss tourists, were killed
in the Luxor attack, which was carried out by Islamic militants.
Four Egyptians and the six gunmen also died.
	   Japan's Foreign Ministry still advises that Japanese who are
staying in Egypt or planning to travel there take precautions, said
a ministry spokesman. He spoke on condition of anonymity.
	   A record 60,200 Japanese visited Egypt last year, up slightly
from 60,130 in 1996, according to Japanese government figures.
	   Egyptian authorities have campaigned against Islamic militants,
including carrying out raids, making arrests and extraditing
suspects abroad.
	   They say the measures have been successful in stopping random
attacks against government officials, police and tourists. More
security forces have also been posted at Egypt's famous temples.

Police warn Singapore politician against speaking publicly
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; By LAURINDA KEYS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Threatened by uniformed police, one of
Singapore's few opposition party leaders gave a rare public speech
without a permit Tuesday, saying all other avenues for
disseminating information had been blocked by the government.
	   ``The constitution of Singapore guarantees me freedom of speech,
assembly and association. I'm exercising that right as a fellow
citizen of Singapore and a member of a political party,'' said Chee
Soon Juan, 36, secretary-general of the Singapore Democratic Party.
	   Standing on a lawn at Raffles Place in Singapore's business
district, Chee drew a crowd of more than 250 people to hear his
hour-long speech criticizing the government's economic, human
rights and foreign affairs policies.
	   Chee made statements seldom heard or read in Singapore. He read
detailed descriptions of alleged torture of political prisoners,
said that Senior Minister Lee Kuan Yew had been wrong to invest
public money in China, and stated that one of Burma's chief drug
lords comes and goes freely in Singapore, which has a death penalty
for drug traffickers.
	   ``The reason why the government doesn't permit politicians to
talk to you like this is because there's a lot of information they
don't want you to know,'' Chee said.
	   Superintendent Low Hui Hui of the central police station warned
Chee three times before he started speaking that addressing the
public without a permit from the Criminal Investigation Division
violates the Public Entertainment Law. ``I just advised him not to
proceed with the talk,'' said Low. ``If he does, we will open an
investigation.''
	   The night before Chee's speech the police force issued a
statement warning that anyone who gives a talk in a public place
without a permit is subject to a 5,000 Singapore dollars (dlrs
3,030) fine.
	   After the speech, as dozens of onlookers crowded around Chee to
ask follow-up questions, police tried to serve the politician with
a summons to appear for questioning.
	   Chee refused to take it and told the crowd that he intended to
speak at the same place and time next week. Chee, who said his
party has about 200 members, has unsuccessfully run twice for
Parliament. The 84-member legislature has been controlled for 38
years by the People's Action Party.
	   Chee said the government had banned his party's political video,
blocked information from being posted on the Internet about
candidates during the last election, refused or delayed until the
last minute issuing permits for public lectures, and fined him for
trying to sell his book on Asian human rights violations.
	   ``If the government is doing such a good job, why does it have
to have so many controls?'' Chee said. ``We had a very peaceful,
intelligent talk today,'' he said, noting that many in the crowd
were bank employees wearing ties or designer skirts. ``Do you see
anybody going on a riot or running rampant? The permit
(requirement) is here for political control.''

Imelda Marcos asks court to dismiss ill-gotten wealth cases
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photo MLA101 &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ The widow of dictator Ferdinand
Marcos Tuesday asked a special anti-graft court to dismiss cases
filed by the Philippine government to recover dlrs 570 million in
Swiss bank deposits the Marcoses allegedly stole from public
coffers.
	   A lawyer of former first lady Imelda Marcos said the cases were
filed by Philippine government lawyers in December 1991, more than
a year after the required period for doing so has expired.
	   Lawyer Rodolfo Jimenez said the Philippine government also
violated a law forbidding the filing of such forfeiture cases one
year before any general elections. Presidential, congressional and
local polls were held in the country in May 1992.
	   Under Philippine laws, forfeiture cases can only be filed within
four years after a government official being charged has been
removed from office, Jimenez told a news conference.
	   Marcos was toppled from power by an army-backed popular revolt
in February 1986 and died in exile in Hawaii three years later.
	   The Philippine government has accused the Marcoses of illegally
enriching themselves while in power and has put claims on the
Marcoses' wealth, including the dlrs 570 million in Swiss bank
deposits now held in an escrow account in a Philippine bank. Marcos
has denied the allegations.
	   The money is being contested by the government, Marcos' heirs
and more than 9,000 human rights victims under Marcos.
	   Mrs. Marcos, who appeared at the news conference, said the
forfeiture cases, which are still pending in the Sandiganbayan
court, have dragged on for years but the government has failed to
produce evidence showing the money was illegally acquired by the
Marcoses.
	   She said she was ready to enter into a settlement with the
administration of President Joseph Estrada.
	   ``I'm always ready to sit down, settle, to do what is right,''
she said, adding she wanted to use the money to support projects
for the poor.
	   ``Our hearts are in the right place,'' Mrs. Marcos said.

Report: Thai drug kingpin sheltered by Myanmar ethnic rebels
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ A fugitive Thai drug kingpin is being
sheltered by ethnic rebels in neighboring Myanmar, a former Thai
army chief said in Tuesday's local papers.
	   Gen. Chetta Thanajaro, retired army commander in chief, said
Myanmar's military government had determined the kingpin was living
with the rebel Red Wa army, according to the Bangkok Post.
	   The Wa are an ethnic group that has signed a cease fire with the
government in Yangon and are allowed to continue drug trafficking.
They are major producers and smugglers of opium, heroin and
amphetamines.
	   The Thai drug trafficker, Surachai Ngernthongfoo, alias Bang
Ron, is wanted in Thailand for allegedly running one of the largest
amphetamine rings in the country.
	   Army officers, including a general, have been implicated in his
business.
	   Chetta told the Post that the government of Myanmar, also known
as Burma, was negotiating with the Wa to have Bang Ron handed over
to Thailand.
	   The Post also reported that the police department will force
officers suspected of involvement in the narcotics trade to take a
rehabilitation course aimed at improving their ethics.
	   The decision came after a deputy prime minister said last week
that as many as 800 government officials are suspected of being
involved in the drug trade, but police do not have enough evidence
to arrest them.

Police warn Singapore politician against speaking publicly

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Threatened by uniformed police, one of
Singapore's few opposition party leaders gave a rare public speech
without a permit Tuesday, saying all other avenues for
disseminating information had been blocked by the government.
	   ``The constitution of Singapore guarantees me freedom of speech,
assembly and association. I'm exercising that right as a fellow
citizen of Singapore and a member of a political party,'' said Chee
Soon Juan, 36, secretary-general of the Singapore Democratic Party.
	   Standing on a lawn at Raffles Place in Singapore's business
district, Chee drew a crowd of more than 250 people to hear his
hour-long speech criticizing the government's economic, human
rights and foreign affairs policies.
	   Chee made statements seldom heard or read in Singapore. He read
detailed descriptions of alleged torture of political prisoners,
said that Senior Minister Lee Kuan Yew had been wrong to invest
public money in China, and stated that one of Burma's chief drug
lords comes and goes freely in Singapore, which has a death penalty
for drug traffickers.
	   ``The reason why the government doesn't permit politicians to
talk to you like this is because there's a lot of information they
don't want you to know,'' Chee said.
	   Superintendent Low Hui Hui of the central police station warned
Chee three times before he started speaking that addressing the
public without a permit from the Criminal Investigation Division
violates the Public Entertainment Law. ``I just advised him not to
proceed with the talk,'' said Low. ``If he does, we will open an
investigation.''
	   The night before Chee's speech the police force issued a
statement warning that anyone who gives a talk in a public place
without a permit is subject to a 5,000 Singapore dollars (dlrs
3,030) fine.
	   After the speech, as dozens of onlookers crowded around Chee to
ask follow-up questions, police tried to serve the politician with
a summons to appear for questioning.
	   Chee refused to take it and told the crowd that he intended to
speak at the same place and time next week. Chee, who said his
party has about 200 members, has unsuccessfully run twice for
Parliament. The 84-member legislature has been controlled for 38
years by the People's Action Party.
	   Chee said the government had banned his party's political video,
blocked information from being posted on the Internet about
candidates during the last election, refused or delayed until the
last minute issuing permits for public lectures, and fined him for
trying to sell his book on Asian human rights violations.
	   ``If the government is doing such a good job, why does it have
to have so many controls?'' Chee said. ``We had a very peaceful,
intelligent talk today,'' he said, noting that many in the crowd
were bank employees wearing ties or designer skirts. ``Do you see
anybody going on a riot or running rampant? The permit
(requirement) is here for political control.''

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Shielded from trial by Prime
Minister Hun Sen, two top Khmer Rouge leaders came to Phnom Penh on
Tuesday and said it was time to forget their brutal rule in the
1970s, which left as many as 2 million people dead.
	   Hun Sen greeted Khieu Samphan and Nuon Chea, members of the
inner circle of late Khmer Rouge chief Pol Pot, with handshakes and
smiles after cementing their defection _ in essence, a surrender _
with public pledges not to try them for genocide.
	   They were flown by helicopter from Pailin, a former rebel
stronghold, to Hun Sen's residence on a military base outside the
capital. After five hours of talks, they checked in at the Phnom
Penh hotel where they were booked for the night.
	   ``This is the end of the Khmer Rouge,'' Khieu Samphan told a mob
of waiting reporters. ``I discussed with His Excellency Hun Sen
that we must forget the past in order to reach national
reconciliation, peace and stability so we can we rebuild our
country.''
	   Neither looked well after months on the run while Khmer Rouge
territory fell under government control. Nuon Chea, 71, walked with
a cane. Khieu Samphan, 67, needed help up the stairs.
	   Khieu Samphan's normally white hair was dyed black in an
apparent attempt at disguise.
	   A truckload of military police stood guard outside the hotel.
Reporters asked Khieu Samphan if he feared becoming the first Khmer
Rouge leader to be put on trial for crimes against humanity.
	   ``It is up to the Cambodian people to pronounce on this
matter,'' Khieu Samphan said.
	   Nuon Chea added: ``We're glad to make a contribution to national
reconciliation.''
	   A news conference was promised for later in the day.
	   Speaking to the British Broadcasting Corp. from Sweden, Thomas
Hammarberg, U.N. Special Representative for Human Rights in
Cambodia, said it would be ``extremely sad'' if the pair were not
charged and tried for crimes against humanity.
	   In the meeting with Hun Sen, they posed for pictures with Ieng
Sary, a Khmer Rouge leader pardoned in 1996 for his role in
genocide in exchange for making peace and leading thousands of
guerrillas out of a stalemated civil war.
	   Leading members of the Cambodian People's Party _ led by people
who, like Hun Sen, were once Khmer Rouge cadres before fleeing
bloody purges in the late 1970s _ joined the meeting.
	   In exchange for ending their part in the war _ all but over for
more than a year anyway _ Hun Sen said Monday he would not try
Khieu Samphan or Nuon Chea for the deaths of as many as 2 million
people.
	   ``If we bring them to trial, it will not benefit the nation, it
will only mean a return to civil war,'' Hun Sen told the Cabinet.
``We should dig a hole and bury the past and look toward the
future.''
	   Khieu Samphan and Nuon Chea have been sheltered for several days
in Pailin, an ex-rebel stronghold nominally under government
control but run by Ieng Sary.
	   It was Nuon Chea's first visit to the capital since the Khmer
Rouge were overthrown in 1979 by a Vietnamese invasion. Khieu
Samphan came to Phnom Penh in 1991 after a peace treaty _ later
broken by the Khmer Rouge _ was signed. He was stoned by a Hun
Sen-controlled mob.
	   In the past two years, granting pardons to Khmer Rouge leaders
ended their war and gave Cambodia new hope of rebuilding. But now,
calls are rising from Cambodians, the United States and other
countries for someone to be held accountable.
	   The Maoist revolutionaries won a civil war in 1975 and forced
Cambodians into slave labor camps. About one person in five
perished from overwork, starvation, disease and executions.
	   Khieu Samphan was the nominal leader, though it is debatable how
much influence he had. Pol Pot and others guarded their identities
and were rarely seen, preferring to send Khieu Samphan to speak in
public.
	   Nuon Chea was regarded as second-in-command and chief political
theorist. There is extensive evidence of his role in mass
executions of party members suspected of treason.
	   Former members of the inner circle who have defected tend to
place all blame on Pol Pot, who died in April of a heart attack.
	   Only one chieftain remains at large: Ta Mok, known as ``The
Butcher,'' somewhere on the Thai border with no more than 100
die-hard loyalists. They pose no threat.
	   Khieu Samphan denied knowing his whereabouts: ``We separated
from Ta Mok a long time ago.''

Two bombs explode outside American Express, Barclays banks
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PIRAEUS, Greece (AP) _ Two time bombs exploded early Tuesday
outside bank branches of American Express and Barclays in Greece's
main port city of Piraeus, causing damage but no injuries, police
said.
	   The dynamite bombs had been placed outside the bank entrances
and exploded within six minutes of each other, shortly after an
anonymous caller warned police that the devices had been placed
outside the banks.
	   The caller, who said he represented the little known group
Revolutionary Cells, did not give a reason for the attack.
	   Barclays bank sustained significant damage from the blast, while
windows shattered in nearby buildings and seven cars parked nearby
were also damaged, police said.
	   The American Express branch suffered less damage, mainly
shattered windows, authorities said.
	   In June, the Revolutionary Cells had claimed responsibility for
a time bomb explosion outside the Athens offices of a government
agency responsible for hiring civil servants. Two police officers
had been slightly injured in that attack.
	   A number of small but prolific terrorist groups have this year
carried out more than 150 attacks, mostly firebombs against offices
and cars belonging to government officials, diplomats, journalists
and foreign companies. The attacks are usually carried out late at
night and rarely cause injury.

Dollar lower against yen, Japanese stocks end higher in Tokyo
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with late dollar, bond, other details

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The U.S. dollar fell against the yen Tuesday in
light year-end trading amid concern about the resilience of
America's prolonged economic expansion. Japanese stock prices rose.
	   The dollar bought 115.36 yen at late afternoon, down 0.76 yen
from late Monday in Tokyo and also below its late New York level of
115.90 yen overnight.
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average gained 137.84
points, or 1.01 percent, to close at 13,846.90. On Monday, the
average fell 88.89 points, or 0.64 percent.
	   The dollar's decline partly reflected increasing pessimism among
Japanese institutional investors about the United States' ability
to sustain its economic boom, traders said.
	   ``The number of dollar bears who see the U.S. economy slowing
down next year is increasing among Japanese institutional investors
and interbank players,'' said Shuji Takano, assistant manager of
foreign exchange at ABN AMRO Bank.
	   Traders also locked in profits on the U.S. currency, which was
boosted earlier in the session by commercial demand and news that
U.S. warplanes fired missiles Monday at an Iraqi air defense site.
	   The attack came two days after Baghdad announced it would fire
at Western aircraft patrolling the no-fly zones over northern and
southern Iraq.
	   The U.S. dollar is considered a safe haven in times of
international unrest. It ranged between 115.15 yen and 116.21 yen
in Tuesday trading.
	   On the stock market, share prices gained in a late surge on
futures-led buying. Trading was thin as many participants have
taken off for the New Year holidays.
	   In New York, the Dow Jones industrial average rose 8.76 points
to 9,226.75 at Monday's close.
	   In Tokyo, many investors also took to the sidelines to await
developments in a proposed coalition deal between Prime Minister
Keizo Obuchi's Liberal Democratic Party and the opposition Liberal
Party.
	   The two sides were expected to seal a pact this week that would
boost the LDP's leverage in Parliament, but last-minute
disagreements caused negotiations to stall.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section gained 8.94 points, 0.83 percent, to 1,088.83. The
TOPIX closed down 3.07 points, or 0.28 percent, the day before.
	   An estimated 226 million shares changed hands on the First
Section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange, up from 191.79 million shares
Monday. Advances outnumbered retreats 635 to 435, while 212 issues
were unchanged.
	   The yield on the benchmark No. 203 10-year Japanese government
bond rose to 1.885 percent from Monday's close of 1.685 percent,
driving its price down to 99.31 yen from 100.93 yen.

Iraq lashes out at Egypt's Mubarak for supporting U.S. line
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By LEON BARKHO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraq's official media on Tuesday lashed out
at Arab leaders for not supporting Saddam Hussein's regime while
his deputy prime minister ridiculed the Egyptian president's remark
that Iraq had provoked this month's U.S.-British airstrikes.
	   Arab leaders must either support Iraq or risk the ``wrath'' of
the Arab masses, Iraqi newspapers said and hailed the widespread
public protests in Arab capitals against the Dec. 16-19 airstrikes.
	   The newspapers were commenting on the Arab League's failure to
convene a proposed meeting of Arab foreign ministers to discuss and
condemn the bombardment.
	   In another sign of dwindling official support for Iraq, hopes
are also fading for holding an Arab summit, which Baghdad hopes
will agree to defy U.N. trade sanctions that were imposed after
Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
	   Under U.N. resolutions, the sanctions cannot be lifted until
U.N. weapons inspectors certify that Iraq is free of nuclear,
chemical and biological weapons along with long-range missiles.
	   The inspectors, complaining that Iraq was obstructing their
work, withdrew from the country Dec. 16, triggering the
U.S.-British assault.
	   The governments in Iraq's Arab neighbors have voiced little
opposition to the airstrikes even though the mood on the streets
has been vehemently pro-Iraq.
	   In a front-page editorial, Iraq's al-Qadissiya newspaper warned
Arab leaders that ignoring ``the snowballing Arab wrath ... will
shake the ground from under their feet.''
	   Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, in one of his most forthright
comments on the crisis, said in an interview published Monday that
President Saddam's rule was responsible for his country's woes.
	   ``The ruling regime (in Iraq) is the reason for all the problems
... and Egypt naturally does not support this regime,'' Mubarak was
quoted as saying by the al-Gomhuriya, an Egyptian government-owned
newspaper.
	   Mubarak, a close U.S. ally, also said that it was he who
persuaded U.S. President Bill Clinton to halt the bombardment,
whose stated aim was to diminish Iraq's ability to build weapons of
mass destruction.
	   Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz responded to Mubarak with
harsh words in an editorial he wrote for Tuesday's al-Jumhouriya,
an Iraqi government-owned newspaper.
	   ``President Mubarak assumes a role for himself which both
Washington and London have not given to him,'' Aziz wrote in the
front-page editorial.
	   ``In reality there is no noble, fair and intelligent person in
Egypt, in the Arab homeland or the whole world sharing Mr. Mubarak
in his deduction,'' Aziz wrote.
	   He said that in reality Mubarak called for a halt to the strikes
because he feared the anger in the Egyptian and Arab streets.
	   In the first armed clash since the end of the airstrikes, U.S.
warplanes patrolling a no-fly zone over northern Iraq fired at an
Iraqi anti-aircraft system on Monday. Iraq said four soldiers were
killed.
	   The United States said the planes fired in self-defense after
coming under Iraqi missile attack. In the aftermath of the
U.S.-British airstrikes, Iraq had vowed to shoot down Western
planes in its air space even if they were enforcing the no-fly
zones.
	   The United States and its allies set up the no-fly zones to
protect Kurdish and Shiite rebels in the north and south from
Saddam's forces.
	   On Tuesday, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhu Bangzao said
his government was ``deeply disturbed'' by the exchange of fire. He
also criticized the no-fly zones as violations of U.N. charter and
international norms.

Snagged Japanese coalition talks postponed until next year

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan's ruling party and a potential coalition
partner decided Tuesday to shelve talks on an alliance agreement
until next year after negotiators failed to forge a compromise over
defense policy, an opposition party official said.
	   The talks for a pact between the government Liberal Democratic
Party and the opposition Liberal Party snagged during the weekend
over the extent to which Japanese troops should be allowed to join
U.N. military missions.
	   The impasse scuttled a meeting planned for Monday between Prime
Minister Keizo Obuchi and Liberal Party leader Ichiro Ozawa.
Negotiators from both sides met on Tuesday to try to work out the
dispute, but the talks later broke up without an agreement.
	   The two sides had hoped to finalize details on the coalition
soon. The LDP is eager to win Liberal Party backing to bolster its
standing in Parliament, where it suffered losses in elections over
the summer.
	   A Liberal Party official speaking on condition of anonymity said
that the two sides decided to wait until Jan. 6, after Japanese New
Year celebrations, to resume talks. News reports also said
negotiators would meet again on that date.
	   On Monday, officials from both sides blamed the other for the
impasse. Ozawa accused the LDP of not being serious about cutting a
deal, which Chief Cabinet Secretary Hiromu Nonaka said the LP's
insistence of a broader military role for Japan jeopardized the
coalition plan.
	   Ozawa is pushing for a new interpretation of Japan's
U.S.-written constitution that would allow troops to participate
more fully in U.N. military missions. The LDP, however, wants to
restrict troops to logistical operations away from potential
combat, arguing that the constitution bans Japanese use of force
abroad.
	   News reports on Tuesday also said that Ozawa was holding out for
a better position in the coalition government. The reports said he
was dissatisfied with the position of home affairs minister that
Obuchi was expected to offer him and instead was eager to become
deputy prime minister. The Liberal Party official said he could not
confirm those reports.
	   So far, the two sides have agreed on reducing the number of
Cabinet posts from 20 to 18 and abolishing the system in which
senior bureaucrats speak on behalf of ministers during Diet
debates.

England wins fourth test
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) _ Paceman Dean Headley bowled England
to a thrilling 12-run victory over Australia in the fourth cricket
test at the MCG on Tuesday.
	   Although Australia has retained the Ashes, England kept its
hopes alive of squaring the series, down 2-1 with one to play.
	   Australia's tail folded dramatically as the team chased 175 for
victory on the fourth afternoon, losing 7-32 after reaching 130 for
three.
	   Headley claimed 6-60 and made the decisive move when he had
Darren Lehmann, Ian Healy and Damien Fleming out in the space of 12
balls with the total stuck on 140.
	   Steve Waugh, who scored a brilliant century in the first
innings, was stranded at the non-striker's end on 30 as Australia
lost its last three wickets for one run.
	   Darren Gough ended the match by bowling Stuart MacGill and
following up with the wicket of Glenn McGrath.
	   After the first day was lost entirely to rain the other three
days were extended.
	   Australia needed 18 for victory and had three wickets in hand
when it opted to play an extra half an hour Tuesday, offered under
the rules when a result is imminent.
	   The English players clearly did not want to stay on the field,
with captain Alec Stewart arguing with the umpires, but the extra
time worked in their favor.
	   The key to England's win was the performance of its
much-maligned tail end batsmen earlier Tuesday. They carried the
score to 244 along with 60 from Graeme Hick.
	   No.11 Alan Mullally, who had five ducks from six previous test
innings this series, even helped out and riled rival paceman Glenn
McGrath by hitting him for consecutive fours in an innings of 16.
	   Australia made a poor start to its chase, losing Michael Slater
and Mark Taylor with 41 on the board. Hick dropped a chance to put
England in control when he spilled a catch from Justin Langer with
41 still on the board.
	   But Langer was removed by a brilliant catch at square leg by
Mark Ramprakash, diving away to his right, and the dismissal
appeared to galvanize the fielding team.

	   PIRAEUS, Greece (AP) _ Two time bombs exploded early Tuesday
outside bank branches of American Express and Barclays in Greece's
main port city of Piraeus, causing damage but no injuries, police
said.
	   The dynamite bombs had been placed outside the bank entrances
and exploded within six minutes of each other, shortly after an
anonymous caller warned police that the devices had been placed
outside the banks.
	   The caller, who said he represented the little known group
Revolutionary Cells, did not give a reason for the attack.
	   Barclays bank sustained significant damage from the blast, while
windows shattered in nearby buildings and seven cars parked nearby
were also damaged, police said.
	   The American Express branch, located about 500 meters (547
yards) away, suffered less damage, mainly shattered windows,
authorities said.

China `deeply disturbed' by shooting in Iraq
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ China said Tuesday it was ``deeply disturbed'' by
a deadly exchange of fire between U.S. warplanes and Iraqi air
defenses and called for preventing a worsening of tensions over
Iraq.
	   Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhu Bangzao also criticized
the two no-fly zones imposed by the United States and its Gulf War
allies over Iraq, saying they violate the United Nations charter
and the norms of international relations.
	   ``We are very concerned about the developments in Iraq and
deeply disturbed by the exchange of fire in northern Iraq and the
casualties incurred,'' Zhu said at a twice-weekly media briefing.
	   Iraq said four soldiers were killed and seven injured when U.S.
planes patrolling a no-fly zone in northern Iraq fired at an Iraqi
anti-aircraft site Monday. The United States said its planes acted
in self-defense after being fired on by Iraq surface-to-air
missiles.
	   The U.S. attack came two days after Baghdad announced it would
fire at Western aircraft patrolling the no-fly zones over northern
and southern Iraq.
	   ``We hold that the establishment of no-fly zones in Iraq runs
counter to the U.N. charter and the norms governing international
relations,'' Zhu, the Chinese spokesman, said.
	   ``We call on the parties concerned to take necessary measures to
avert further deterioration of the situation,'' he added.
	   He said issues left over from the 1990-1991 Gulf War should be
settled fairly and reasonably ``to restore peace and stability in
the region.''

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ The bodies of four kidnapped men who were beheaded
in Chechnya arrived in London early Tuesday on a flight from
Azerbaijan.
	   The four victims _ Peter Kennedy, Darren Hickey and Rudolf
Petschi of Britain, and New Zealand's Stanley Shaw _ were kidnapped
in Chechnya Oct. 3, and their severed heads were found by a
roadside on Dec. 8.
	   Their bodies, which were found Saturday near the Chechen
capital, Grozny, were put on a British Airways flight before dawn
in Baku in the presence of British diplomats and Chechen officials.
	   The bodies had arrived in Baku from Chechnya in a convoy
accompanied by Chechen Deputy Prime Minister Turpal Atgeriyev and
Deputy Prosecutor General Magomed Magomadov. Officials from the
British Embassy in Azerbaijan met the convoy in Russia, according
to Russian press reports.
	   At Gatwick Airport, the coffins were unloaded and taken to an
area where relatives could collect them away from the public gaze,
an airport spokeswoman said. Foreign Office officials were also
there.
	   ``It is a relief to have the feeling that they are finally
coming home,'' Hickey's father, Eamonn, said Monday night. ``We are
still devastated but at least there will be a funeral after all.''
	   The handover was originally planned for Monday, but appeared to
have been delayed by the sides' disagreement on where it should
take place.
	   A spokesman for the British Embassy in Moscow, Mike Haddock,
said Britain wanted the handover to take place in the Russian
capital, the Interfax news agency reported.
	   But Chechnya's Deputy Prime Minister Kazbek Makhashev said the
separatist republic considered the proposal ``unacceptable'' and
wanted the bodies to be handed over in Azerbaijan, Interfax
reported.
	   Chechnya, which had fought a 1994-96 war for secession from
Russia, adamantly tries to assert its independence from Moscow. No
country has recognized its sovereignty.
	   The bodies of the four men were found Saturday in the village of
Chernorechiye, on the outskirts of the Chechen capital, Grozny.
Doctors confirmed their identities Sunday, according to Chechen
Prosecutor General Mansur Tagirov.
	   A mourning service for the four was held Monday in the church of
St. Archangel Michael in Grozny, the capital of predominantly
Muslim Chechnya.
	   Authorities said the men, who were in Chechnya to set up a
cellular phone system, had been killed after a rescue attempt went
wrong.
	   The region, in the southern Caucasus, has experienced a boom in
crime and kidnappings for ransom since Chechnya's independence war
ended.

Iraq lashes out at Egypt's Mubarak for supporting U.S. line
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By LEON BARKHO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraq's official media lashed out Tuesday at
Arab leaders for not supporting Saddam Hussein's regime, and his
deputy prime minister criticized the Egyptian president for saying
that Iraq provoked the recent U.S.-British airstrikes.
	   Arab leaders must either support Iraq or risk the ``wrath'' of
the Arab masses, Iraqi newspapers said in reference to the Arab
League's failure to convene a proposed meeting of Arab foreign
ministers to discuss and condemn the Dec. 16-19 airstrikes, which
prompted widespread public protests in Arab capitals.
	   In another sign of dwindling official support for Iraq, hopes
were fading for an Arab summit in which Baghdad believes Arab
leaders will agree to defy U.N. trade sanctions imposed after
Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
	   Under U.N. resolutions, the sanctions cannot be lifted until
U.N. weapons inspectors certify that Iraq is free of nuclear,
chemical and biological weapons along with long-range missiles.
	   The inspectors, complaining that Iraq was obstructing their
work, withdrew from the country Dec. 16, triggering the
U.S.-British assault.
	   The governments of Iraq's Arab neighbors have voiced little
opposition to the airstrikes although the mood on the streets has
been vehemently pro-Iraq.
	   In a front-page editorial, Iraq's al-Qadissiya newspaper warned
Arab leaders that ignoring ``the snowballing Arab wrath ... will
shake the ground from under their feet.''
	   Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, in one of his most forthright
comments on the crisis, said in an interview published Monday that
Saddam was responsible for his country's woes.
	   ``The ruling regime (in Iraq) is the reason for all the problems
... and Egypt naturally does not support this regime,'' Mubarak was
quoted as saying in the al-Gomhuriya, an Egyptian government-owned
newspaper.
	   Mubarak, a close U.S. ally, also said that it was he who
persuaded U.S. President Bill Clinton to halt the bombardment,
which was intended to diminish Iraq's ability to build weapons of
mass destruction.
	   Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz responded with harsh
words in a front-page editorial he wrote for Tuesday's
al-Jumhouriya, an Iraqi government-owned newspaper.
	   ``President Mubarak assumes a role for himself which both
Washington and London have not given to him,'' Aziz wrote. ``In
reality there is no noble, fair and intelligent person in Egypt, in
the Arab homeland or the whole world sharing Mr. Mubarak in his
deduction.''
	   Mubarak called for a halt to the strikes because he feared the
anger in the Egyptian and Arab streets, Aziz said.
	   In the first armed clash since the end of the airstrikes, U.S.
warplanes patrolling a no-fly zone over northern Iraq fired Monday
at an Iraqi anti-aircraft system. Iraq said four soldiers were
killed.
	   The United States said the planes fired in self-defense after
coming under Iraqi missile attack. In the aftermath of the
U.S.-British airstrikes, Iraq vowed to shoot down Western planes in
its air space even if they were enforcing the no-fly zones.
	   The United States and its allies set up the no-fly zones to
protect Kurdish and Shiite rebels in the north and south from
Saddam's forces.
	   On Tuesday, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhu Bangzao said
his government was ``deeply disturbed'' by the exchange of fire. He
also criticized the no-fly zones as violations of U.N. charter and
international norms.

 &UR; PUERTO RICO: Half of inmates may be infected with hepatitis C &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) _ Preliminary tests show half the
inmates in Puerto Rican prisons are infected with hepatitis C, a
serious liver disease, the island's health department said Monday.
	   Health Secretary Carmen Feliciano confirmed a report by El Nuevo
Dia newspaper that 49 percent of inmates _ 5,695 of 11,530 _ tested
in August carried the virus.
	   She told reporters that a second round of tests to verify
results has not been completed, and added officials suspect many of
the inmates were already infected when they were imprisoned. Many
were drug users who could have been infected by sharing needles
before they were imprisoned, Feliciano said.
	   ``At this moment, we cannot arrive at the conclusion that this
is an outbreak,'' she said. ``We don't know which ones are acute
and which are chronic, nor can we conclude whether they were
contaminated inside or outside the prison.''
	   In June, a government epidemiologist in this U.S. Caribbean
territory had estimated only 1,000 inmates had the virus; and last
year, the Correctional Health Program told a federal court only 500
inmates are treated for the disease. The only treatments for
hepatitis are antiviral drugs that cost thousands of dollars a year
for each patient.
 &UR; BARBADOS: Analysts say opposition has tough campaign ahead
	   BRIDGETOWN, Barbados (AP) _ The main opposition party in
Barbados has a tough campaign ahead of it, two analysts told a
newspaper Monday.
	   Prime Minister Owen Arthur's Barbados Labor Party is favored to
win the elections, announced on Saturday for Jan. 20, by touting
the island's strong economy and recent public works projects.
	   The opposition Democratic Labor Party is likely to focus on the
island's crime wake in the wake of a spate of gun crimes, said
Neville Duncan, a political science professor at the University of
the West Indies.
	   ``Right now people are really concerned about their public
safety,'' Duncan told the Barbados Advocate.
	   He predicted Arthur's party would counter by citing new
gun-control legislation that hikes the punishment for illegal
possession of firearms from two years in prison to 20 years.
	   The Democratic Labor Party will probably concentrate on winning
the key southwestern districts of St. Michael and Christ Church,
said George Belle, another University of the West Indies political
science expert.
	   Meanwhile, the leader of the minority National Democratic Party
said his group's decision not to participate in the election does
not signal its end.
	   ``Throughout the world, political parties have for one reason or
another sat out elections (and) have come back with greater
strength, and that is what will happen to the NDP,'' leader Riches
Haynes told the Barbados Nation.
 &UR; VATICAN CITY: Pope thanks Castro for allowing Christmas
	   VATICAN CITY (AP) _ Pope John Paul II has thanked Cuban leader
Fidel Castro for allowing Christmas to be celebrated as an official
holiday on the Communist-run island.
	   ``I want to express to you my deep appreciation for the decision
to give back to Christmas its holiday character for all Cubans,
conforming to tradition,'' the pope said in a telegram to Castro,
whom he wished a happy holiday.
	   The telegram was sent Dec. 23 but only disclosed by the Vatican
on Monday.
	   In November, the Cuban government declared Christmas an official
holiday, and this year allowed the local Roman Catholic Church the
rare privilege of broadcasting a national greeting on state radio.
	   In his telegram, the pope said he was praying so that ``with the
collaboration of all the citizens, this noble country, always
present in my heart, can consolidate its way toward a more
prosperous, just and fraternal society.''
	   John Paul met with Castro when he visited the island in January.
During that pilgrimage, the pontiff called for an end to the U.S.
economic embargo on Cuba.
	   The Christmas message by Cuba's top Catholic leader, Cardinal
Jaime Ortega, further testified to warmer relations between Havana
and the church.
 &UR; CUBA: Earthquake, magnitude 5.4, north of Cuba
	   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) _ A moderate earthquake erupted in
the Atlantic Ocean just north of Cuba early Monday, but there were
no immediate reports of damage.
	   The quake of magnitude 5.4 hit at 3:23 a.m. (7:23 GMT) and was
centered 60 miles (100 kilometers) north of Guantanamo, in the
Atlantic Ocean off eastern Cuba, according to the U.S. Geological
Survey's National Earthquake Information Center in Golden,
Colorado.
	   Quakes of such strength can cause moderate damage, but none was
immediately reported Monday.
 &UR; UNITED STATES: Scientists trying to restore conch to ``Conch
Republic''
	   LONG KEY, Florida (AP) _ The Conch Republic is conched out.
	   The mollusk meat in the conch chowder you can get at just about
any restaurant in the Florida Keys probably came from Jamaica or
South America. There just aren't enough conch left to harvest in
the Florida Keys, despite its nickname as the Conch Republic.
	   Bob Glazer and the state of Florida are trying to change that.
	   In giant tanks out behind the Keys Marine Lab crawl the
snail-like animals _ pronounced ``konk'' _ that Glazer hopes to
reintroduce to the waters around the Keys.
	   There's more at stake than biological diversity.
	   This, after all, is the Conch Republic. The current situation is
kind of like a banana republic with no bananas.
	   The high school teams in Key West are known as the Conchs (the
cheerleaders are the Conchettes). Tourists ride around town on the
Conch Train.
	   Babies born in the Keys get a Conch Republic birth certificate
that says they are officially Conchs. People who move to the Keys
earn the right to be called ``freshwater conchs'' after seven
years.
	   Glazer, who works for the Florida Department of Environmental
Protection, is a freshwater conch. But he knows more about mollusca
gastropoda strombidae strombus gigas _ the Queen Conch _ than most
of the natives. And he is determined to bring the animal back.

Report: Former Singapore opposition politician jailed for bomb hoax
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ A former opposition politician with a criminal
history has been jailed for 18 months for a bomb hoax nearly 13
years ago, a newspaper reported Tuesday.
	   Wee Lai Seng, a 46-year old former United Front candidate who
lost his bids for Parliament in 1979 and 1980, made two calls on
Feb. 21, 1986 claiming he would detonate two bombs planted in the
Criminal Investigation Department headquarters by remote control,
said The Straits Times.
	   Police searched the CID premises but found no bombs.
	   On the run since then, he was arrested earlier this month upon
arriving by plane from Thailand, according to the newspaper.
	   Wee, who identified himself in both bomb threats, pleaded guilty
to two charges of transmitting false telephone messages, under the
Telecommunications Authority of Singapore Act.
	   He had previous convictions for mischief by fire, cheating and
disorderly behavior, said the report.
	   Wee's reasons for the bomb hoax were not mentioned in the
newspaper article.

New Zealand calls for end to five-test series
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By IHITHISHAM KAMARDEEN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) _ New Zealand will call for an end
to Australia's traditional five-match cricket series against
England and the West Indies when a test world championship is
discussed next week.
	   New Zealand Cricket chief executive Chris Doig will take a
proposal to an International Cricket Council meeting in
Christchurch next week supporting a world title to be decided over
a four-year cycle.
	   Doig said the traditional series _ the Ashes and the Frank
Worrell Trophy _ will remain as part of the championship ladder but
might be cut down from five to three-match series.
	   ``The traditional series are essential,'' Doig said. ``Australia
was adamant the traditional series remained.''
	   But there is discontent from other nations who only get to play
three-test series against teams such as Australia and England.
	   A paper detailing New Zealand's proposed schedule will be tabled
along with similar proposals by India, West Indies and South Africa
when the ICC subcommittee for a test championship meets in
Christchurch.
	   ``We want to regularize tours and give some context to test
match cricket,'' said Doig.
	   Under the proposed schedule, countries will play each other home
and away during the cycle and all test series will have a bearing
on the championship.
	   At the end of the four-year period the top two teams will figure
in a play-off to determine the championship winner.
	   India's Jagmohan Dalmiya, the chairman of the ICC has proposed a
test championship over a two-month period.
	   ``Seven of the nine countries support the four-year rotating
program,'' Doig said. ``The main aim is to give context to test
cricket, which we all want to see.''
	   Doig felt countries like India, New Zealand, Sri Lanka and
Zimbabwe saw very little of the ``brand teams'' and the proposal
would ensure a fairness in the proportioning of future match
scheduling.
	   ``Currently there is no regularity in the international calendar
apart from the major traditional series. Every country should visit
each other over a four-year period. There is a great deal of sense
in it,'' Doig said.

Chinese dissident issues protest from prison
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ In a letter penned in handcuffs from prison, a
Chinese dissident has defiantly protested as ``political
persecution'' his 13-year sentence for trying to form an opposition
party.
	   Xu Wenli said he would not appeal his sentence out of contempt
for the judicial system that prosecuted him last week.
	   ``My so-called open trial was in truth nothing but a means of
political persecution,'' Xu wrote in the letter, dated Monday and
made available to foreign news organizations.
	   ``First, I will not answer any questions. Second, I will not
defend myself. Third, I will not appeal to a higher court. This is
a silent protest against political persecution.''
	   Xu is among four activists tried and sentenced in the past two
weeks in China's harshest crackdown on political dissent in two
years.
	   Charged with endangering state security, Xu, Qin Yongmin and
Wang Youcai were sentenced to 13, 12 and 11 years respectively for
trying to organize the China Democracy Party. Labor rights
campaigner Zhang Shanguang was sentenced to 10 years Sunday under
the same statute for telling U.S. government-funded Radio Free Asia
about a farmers protest.
	   Xu is the oldest and most experienced democracy campaigner of
the four. His prison protest accuses a small number of leaders
within the ruling Communist Party of protecting their vested
interests by using China's legal system to defend one-party rule.
	   ``Pluralism in the political sphere is historically inevitable.
No individual or political party can prevent this,'' Xu wrote.
	   ``History will judge us fairly,'' wrote Xu, who in recent months
had provided guidance for younger dissidents and a moderate voice
for the beleaguered democracy movement.
	   The statement ended with the words ``penned in handcuffs'' and
with instructions to Xu's court-appointed lawyer to deliver copies
to his wife and to court authorities.
	   During the Democracy Wall protests of the late 1970s, Xu united
dissidents publishing underground journals to form one of the most
influential periodicals of the time.
	   Convicted of subversion in 1982, Xu spent 12 years in prison,
much of it in solitary confinement. After writing an account of his
arrest and trial that was smuggled out of prison, Xu was moved into
a damp cement vault and not allowed out for 3 1/2 years.
	   When he became politically active again after his parole ended
last year, Xu resumed writing about democracy and China's future
and openly organizing other dissidents.

Bringing the conch back to the Conch Republic
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photos FLAAN101-102 Dec. 28 &QL; 
 &UR; By DAVID ROYSE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONG KEY, Florida (AP) _ The Conch Republic is conched out.
	   The mollusk meat in the conch chowder you can get at just about
any restaurant in the Florida Keys probably came from Jamaica or
South America. There just aren't enough conch left to harvest in
the Florida Keys, despite its nickname as the Conch Republic.
	   Bob Glazer and the state of Florida are trying to change that.
	   In giant tanks out behind the Keys Marine Lab crawl the
snail-like animals _ pronounced ``konk'' _ that Glazer hopes to
reintroduce to the waters around the Keys.
	   There's more at stake than biological diversity.
	   This, after all, is the Conch Republic. The current situation is
kind of like a banana republic with no bananas.
	   The high school teams in Key West are known as the Conchs (the
cheerleaders are the Conchettes). Tourists ride around town on the
Conch Train.
	   Babies born in the Keys get a Conch Republic birth certificate
that says they are officially Conchs. People who move to the Keys
earn the right to be called ``freshwater conchs'' after seven
years.
	   Glazer, who works for the Florida Department of Environmental
Protection, is a freshwater conch. But he knows more about mollusca
gastropoda strombidae strombus gigas _ the Queen Conch _ than most
of the natives. And he is determined to bring the animal back.
	   In 1965, a quarter-million conch were harvested in the Keys,
Glazer said.
	   Today there's a tiny fraction of that number in the water.
Commercial harvesting of conch has been banned in the Keys since
1975. Recreational taking of the conch was outlawed in 1986.
	   It wasn't so much the quest for the tough meat served in
chowder, conch fritters, conch ceviche or cracked conch that led to
the depletion of the species in the Keys.
	   It was more the desire for the shell _ the large, familiar pink
and white shell that can double as a horn (and does every year
during Key West's annual conch shell blowing contest.) Many older
buildings here are made of conch, as are some roads. Countless
shells have been sold to tourists.
	   If the population ever rebounded so harvesting could begin
again, there would be a market throughout the 110-mile
(175-kilometer) island chain, said Judy Correa, who runs the Key
West Cafe Sole, where raw conch carpaccio _ made from Bahamas conch
_ is one of the most popular dishes.
	   The hatchery was opened in 1991 on Long Key. Since then, Glazer
and his colleagues have released about 6,000 conch into the wild
and studied them to determine whether laboratory-hatched conch can
survive in the ocean. They tag the animals with aluminum and use
metal detectors to keep track of them.
	   The Keys aren't the only place where conch are having trouble.
Internationally, they are one step from being classified as
threatened.
	   Jamaica has limited its season. Puerto Rico, Venezuela and the
Turks and Caicos islands all have hatcheries.
	   The hatcheries all have the same problem: Although they produce
millions of juveniles each year, their conch planting efforts are
plagued by a high mortality rate.
	   Researchers have to teach young conch to bury themselves in the
sand to protect themselves. The conch go through a week of predator
school.
	   ``We put the lobster in a cage so the conch can see it and smell
it _ but the lobster can't actually attack them,'' Glazer said.

Yeltsin vows that Russia will continue reforms
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ President Boris Yeltsin pledged Tuesday that the
government won't backtrack on democratic and market reforms even
though Russia is mired in the worst economic crisis since the end
of the Soviet era.
	   ``There is no other path for Russia than toward democracy,''
Yeltsin said in a letter published in the business daily
Kommersant.
	   Yeltsin has said little and done even less to address the
economic crisis, leaving day-to-day management of the economy to
Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov.
	   Primakov has said that Russia should continue the market
reforms, but put an end to ``wild'' capitalism by strengthening
state regulation of the economy.
	   Critics say that the government, struggling to pay off domestic
and foreign debts, is likely to print a huge amount of new cash,
leading to the kind of high inflation that has plagued Russia in
the past.
	   Many fear that hyperinflation would push Russia toward
Soviet-style price and currency controls and rationing.
	   Yeltsin said he would not allow that.
	   ``The outgoing year 1998 wasn't the easiest for any of us, and
many people might think that the nation has reversed on its path,''
Yeltsin said. ``That isn't true. As the president of Russia, I say
that there is no way back.''

Former saleswoman indicted in mass curry-poisoning in Japan
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ A woman was charged Tuesday with murder and
attempted murder in a mass poisoning with arsenic-laced curry that
killed four people in western Japan.
	   Masumi Hayashi, 37, a former insurance saleswoman arrested Oct.
4, is also suspected in a series of murder attempts to collect
insurance money.
	   The July 25 poisoning with curry served at a community festival
killed four people, including two children, and sickened 63 people.
The poisoning alarmed Japan, a relatively crime-free nation, and
set off copycat poisonings.
	   Japanese media have ranked the poisoning in Wakayama, 450
kilometers (280 miles) southwest of Tokyo, as the top news item of
1998.
	   Hayashi has denied the charges, her lawyers say. Among those she
is alleged to have tried to kill is her husband, Kenji Hayashi, 53,
who has been arrested on separate insurance fraud charges.
	   Prosecutors say an analysis showed that the arsenic found in the
Hayashis' home matched the arsenic in the curry.

	   TOKYO (AP) _ U.S. financial services company American Express
Co. plans to establish a securities company in Japan next year, a
company spokesman said Tuesday.
	   The company has applied to the Finance Ministry for permission
to set up the venture under new rules that make it easier to launch
a brokerage in Japan, said company spokemsan Mitsuo Inagaki.
	   American Express hopes to sell investment funds to individual
investors, but the company has not yet decided on its range of
products, Inagaki said.
	   The move comes as many foreign financial institutions launch or
expand operations in Japan to take advantage of the country's ``Big
Bang'' financial deregulation reforms.
	   American Express applied to set up its new company under a rule
change implemented this month that eases the cumbersome approval
process for new brokerages, Inagaki said.
	   Last year, American Express established an investment-advisory
business in Tokyo in its first step toward full-fledged asset
management operations in Japan.

	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Japan' Nissan Motor Co. and its
partners decided to close their Indonesian car factory because of
poor economic conditions, the Jakarta stock exchange said.
	   One of Nissan's partners, PT Indomobil Sukses Internasional,
sent a letter to the exchange in which it announced the closure of
PT Ismac Nissan Manufacturing.
	   ``The decision was made on grounds that a recovery in the
country's automotive industry can't be achieved soon,'' the stock
exchange on Monday quoted the letter as saying.
	   The Indonesian car plant assembled 1,450 vehicles this year,
compared to 7,625 in 1997.
	   Indonesia's worst economic crisis in decades was triggered last
year by the fall of Asian currencies. The regional financial
turmoil has hit especially hard in Indonesia, where millions of
people have lost their jobs and prices have soared.
	   The economy shrank as much as 16 percent this year and a full
recovery is expected to take years.

	   BEIJING (AP) _ Chinese courts can impose sentences of up to life
in prison for those found guilty of violating a newly revised
foreign exchange law, the state-run Xinhua News Agency reported
Tuesday.
	   A revision to the law adopted Tuesday by the top committee of
the National People's Congress stipulates a maximum sentence of
life imprisonment for major violations of foreign exchange
regulations, the report said.
	   Those convicted of purchasing foreign exchange using forged
documents, of evading payments or of engaging in illegal trading
activities could face the maximum penalty, it said without
describing previous penalties.
	   The revised law tightens enforcement of rules banning companies
from making illegal deposits or transfers of foreign exchange
abroad and it holds government and company officials liable to
criminal prosecution for allowing others to commit such offenses.
	   Those found guilty under the law may face fines of between 5
percent and 30 percent of the value of the illegal transactions,
Xinhua added.
	   China's currency, the yuan, is convertible only for trade and
related services. The government has been stepping up enforcement
of widely flouted currency controls to help ensure a stable
exchange rate and prevent companies and individuals from illegally
transfering funds overseas.
	   Police recently uncovered 232 cases of illegal currency deals
involving the equivalent of more than dlrs 8.8 billion, many of
which involved the use of forged documents, the newspaper Legal
Daily reported Tuesday.

	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ U.S.-based Delphi Automotive Systems, the
world's largest vehicle components maker, laid off 15 percent of
its plant workers in Singapore, a spokesman said Tuesday.
	   The plant was temporarily closed Monday, and all 1,500 employees
were invited in to hear the details. Termination notices were given
to 229 in small groups, said Delphi spokesman John Anderson.
Interviews were set up with 11 other multinational companies and 23
job offers were made to the retrenched employees by early
afternoon.
	   Anderson said employees were told early in December that Delphi,
which is being spun off from General Motors early next year, would
be restructuring in Singapore and retrenchments could be expected.
	   ``We have been working hard to avoid this type of restructuring
since April 1995, redeploying workers instead, and adopting hiring
freezes,'' Anderson said. Short shifts, a weekend shift and a third
shift were introduced ``in an effort to balance things out,'' he
said.
	   There is no union at the plant, but the company dealt with the
National Trade Unions Council, he said. No offer was made to freeze
or reduce pay in order to save jobs, as the government has
suggested to some unions during Singapore's worst economic crisis
in a decade.
	   The plant, previously run by the Delco company, has been
operating in Singapore for 20 years.

	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ The cabinet plans to create tax incentives
and other measures to prop up Taiwan's property market, where the
effects of a 7-year slump have worsened amid the recent economic
slowdown, officials said Tuesday.
	   Details of the strategy will be announced Thursday, but the
package also will include loans to boost buying sentiment and other
measures to reduce construction, government spokesman Chen
Chien-jen said.
	   A task force will also be set up to study financial aid to
troubled real estate companies, he said.
	   Property developers _ also hard-hit by a credit crunch _ have
requested a government bailout.
	   The property slump has left an estimated 800,000 housing units
vacant throughout Taiwan, idling assets that cost developers at
least 1 trillion Taiwan dollars (U.S. dlrs 31 billion).
	   In hopes to shore up profits, property developers have purchased
large land tracts, but many of the large-scale housing projects
were ill-devised or built in remote areas.
	   Officials said they have rejected a request by developers to set
up a government fund to purchase the homes, saying it would
encourage them to build more.
	   Instead, they said, the government will suspend some public
housing projects, reduce real estate transfer taxes, and provide
low-interest housing loans.
	   Bankers have said they fear Taiwan's economic problems could
worsen if property prices collapse because some 40 percent of bank
loans are collateralized with real estate.

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ In a new blow to Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu, his closest political ally, Foreign Minister Ariel
Sharon, says he does not rule out running for prime minister.
	   Elections have been set for May 17.
	   Sharon, a popular hawk and the most experienced minister in
Netanyahu's Cabinet, did not say whether he would challenge
Netanyahu for Likud Party leadership in January primaries or form
his own slate if he decides to run.
	   Two hard-line politicians have already announced that they are
running for prime minister.
	   Uzi Landau, chairman of parliament's Defense and Foreign Affairs
Committee, is seeking Likud's nomination for prime minister. Benny
Begin, a son of former Prime Minister Menachem Begin and one-time
member of Netanyahu's Cabinet, announced Monday that he is leaving
the party to run on his own slate.
	   The chances of both Landau and Begin are seen as remote.
	   However, Sharon has always maintained a strong independent
following and could win the support of former Netanyahu supporters
opposed to a land-for-peace agreement with the Palestinians.
	   Sharon's acknowledgement on Monday evening that he was
considering a bid for prime minister came as a surprise.
	   Only on Sunday, he had told Likud's Central Committee that he
did ``not want to be prime minister.'' Less than 24 hours later, he
said on a TV talk show that under certain circumstances, he might
enter the race.
	   ``There is a difference between `I don't want to be prime
minister' and running under special circumstances,'' Sharon said.
	   There was speculation he could enter the race if Netanyahu's
popularity drops or key leaders abandon the Likud party.
	   Sharon resigned his post as defense minister in 1983 after he
was held indirectly responsible for the massacre of hundreds of
Palestinians during Israel's military offensive to chase PLO
guerrillas out of Lebanon. Later, he served only in second-rank
posts despite his popularity.
	   The Likud and the opposition Labor Party agreed Monday that
elections would be held on May 17 after the parliament gave initial
approval last week to a bill for early elections. An expected
second round would be held June 1.
	   Recent polls have shown that no candidate would receive enough
votes to win a first round.

Korean parliament approves new name for spy agency
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ The National Assembly on Tuesday
approved a new name for South Korea's spy agency, hoping the change
will help polish an image tarnished by years of human rights
abuses.
	   The new name, National Intelligence Service, will take effect as
soon as the country promulgates a law approving the name change in
mid-January.
	   Since he took office in February, President Kim Dae-jung,
himself a former dissident once kidnapped and tortured by
government agents, has been overhauling the agency, now officially
called the Agency for National Security Planning.
	   In April, the agency began using the new name, saying it wanted
``a new beginning as an intelligence agency trusted by the
people.''
	   On Tuesday, the single-house Assembly approved the name change
with support from both the ruling and opposition parties.
	   Formerly called the Korean Central Intelligence Agency, the
organization adopted its current name in what skeptics viewed as a
cosmetic change to clean up its image following the 1979
assassination of former President Park Chung-hee by the agency's
chief.
	   The country's past military rulers used the agency to suppress
dissidents. Among its targets was President Kim, who was jailed,
tortured and kidnapped by government agents in the 1970s and 1980s.
	   Since Kim took office, two-thirds of the agency's senior
officials have been fired in a purge aimed at removing the agency
from domestic politics. Hundreds of lower-ranking agents also were
dismissed.

Top opposition leader's brother indicted for raising illegal funds
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ Prosecutors indicted the brother of
the head of South Korea's largest opposition party Tuesday on
charges of raising illegal political funds for him during last
year's presidential election campaign.
	   Lee Hoi-sung, 54, an advisor to a government-funded energy
research center, was accused of collecting 15 billion won (dlrs
12.5 million) for his brother, Lee Hoi-chang, 62, then the ruling
party's presidential candidate.
	   Prosecutors said the younger Lee colluded with top national tax
officials to pressure 25 businesses to contribute funds to his
brother's campaign.
	   Under South Korean law, all political contributions should be
made through official party channels or a neutral election
management committee.
	   In the Dec. 18 election, Lee Hoi-chang lost to opposition
candidate Kim Dae-jung by a narrow margin. It marked the first
transfer of power from a ruling party to an opposition party in
South Korean history.
	   The opposition leader and his brother have denied involvement in
the scheme, but prosecutors said they have enough evidence to
incriminate them.
	   Prosecutors said the tax officials gave tax cuts and other
favors to companies that contributed to Lee's campaign.
	   After the new government was installed early this year, Lim
Chae-ju, then head of the National Tax Office, was arrested for
alleged involvement in the illegal fund raising.

Three Romanians jailed for posing as police during World Cup
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SAINT-ETIENNE, France (AP) _ Three Romanian men have been jailed
for a year for robbing soccer fans while posing as police officers
during the World Cup.
	   The thieves, identified as Dimitri Ionita, Florin Popeanu and
Adrian Prodan, were sentenced late Monday night. They are all in
their 30s and known criminals.
	   They pleaded guilty to robbing fans after stopping them in the
street for what they said were police searches for drugs.
	   Arrested June 19 after a match between Spain and Paraguay in
this town in central France, the three men were carrying South
American and Spanish currency.
	   When ordered to identify themselves, they produced false Italian
papers.
	   The men were also banned from returning to France for 10 years.

Hong Kong's recession worsened in third quarter
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Hong Kong sank slightly deeper into recession
in the third quarter than economists had originally estimated, but
the revised figures were not bad enough to warrant a gloomier
forecast for the full year, the government said Tuesday.
	   Gross domestic product fell by 7.1 percent for the three months
ending Sept. 30, a drop that was 0.1 percentage point more than the
preliminary estimate released last month. Hong Kong showed its
worst quarterly economic performance since 1973, the first year
when officials began measuring such statistics.
	   The government's earlier forecast that the economy would shrink
by 5 percent for all of 1998 was not revised. Hong Kong's GDP had
fallen by 5.1 percent in the second quarter and 2.6 percent in the
first quarter, according to Hong Kong's Census and Statistics
Department.
	   A sharp fall of 10 percent in private consumption expenditure
was one of the major reasons for the continued recession.
	   Local consumer spending was depressed by the rise in
unemployment, which hit a record 5.5 percent in the three months
ending Nov. 30 _ the highest since the government began keeping
those numbers in 1981.
	   Hong Kong's recession also has been attributed to continued
slackening in domestic consumer demand, a significant decline in
investment spending and the further setback in export performance.
	   Hong Kong's exports fell 7 percent in the third quarter.
	   Inflation was just 0.4 percent in the third quarter. In
November, the territory registered deflation _ or falling prices _
for the first time in 23 years, with the composite consumer price
index dropping by 0.7 percent.
	   Despite all the gloomy economic news, the government said there
were some positive signs emerging, including loosening of the
credit crunch, successive cuts in local interest rates, and a
rebound in prices of shares and real estate.
	   These factors and improved sentiment should boost local demand
in due course, officials said.

Visitors to Poland must show financial support
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ A new customs regulation that takes effect
Friday requires foreigners entering Poland to show they have enough
money for their stay upon request.
	   Under the existing law, visitors only have to show a passport
and in some cases a visa, depending on which country they come
from. Beginning Jan. 1, customs officials also can request proof of
sufficient finances for the length of the visit.
	   According to the regulations announced Monday, tourists and
others on private visits who are older than 16 must have at least
500 zlotys (dlrs 143), or at least 100 zlotys (dlrs 28.60) for each
day they intend to stay.
	   Those under 16 must have at least 300 zlotys (dlrs 85.80) or 50
zlotys (dlrs 14.30) for each day. Other visitors involved in
organized activities _ such as tour groups, youth camps or those
seeking medical treatment _ must have at least 100 zlotys, or 20
zlotys (dlrs 5.72) a day.
	   Foreigners using Poland as a transit point also must have money
_ 200 zlotys (dlrs 57.20) for those over 16 and 100 zlotys for the
rest.
	   Since the end of communist rule opened Poland's borders in 1989,
the country has struggled with illegal immigration and smuggling
from impoverished territories of the former Soviet Union to the
east.
	   With Poland planning to join NATO in 1999 and negotiating to
join the European Union early in the next century, it must upgrade
its border security to Western standards.
	   Polish officials have said the new regulations were intended to
tighten border controls without having to reintroduce visas from
former Soviet territories to the east.
	   At the start of 1998, Poland began requiring proof of hotel
reservations and sufficient money from visitors from Russia and
Belarus, evoking protests from Moscow and Minsk and similar
requirements on Polish visitors.

Hong Kong shares close higher in light trading
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Hong Kong stocks ended slightly higher Tuesday
with few shares traded as investors stayed away for the holiday
season.
	   The blue-chip Hang Seng Index rose 55.83 points, or 0.5 percent,
to close at 10,225.97.
	   Trading volume was thin, with some fund managers switching to
other markets in preparation for the inauguration of the single
European currency _ the euro _ on Monday, said Felix Ngai of Sun
Hung Kai Commodities Ltd.
	   Selling in big property shares in the afternoon gave a late
boost to the weak market turnover, which hit 1.33 billion Hong Kong
dollars (U.S. dlrs 170 million) _ barely higher than Monday's
six-year low of 1.22 billion Hong Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs 156
million).
	   The day's biggest gainers were banking giant HSBC Holdings, up
2.00 Hong Kong dollars to close at 197.00; China Light, up 0.50 at
39.40; and Cheung Kong Infrastructure, up 0.40 at 17.75.
	   Conglomerate Swire Pacific ``A'' was up 0.10 at 35.70.
	   Among the losers were Henderson Land, down 0.40 at 40.70;
Hutchison Whampoa, down 0.25 at 54.75; Sun Hung Kai Properties,
down 0.25 at 57.25; and Cheung Kong Holdings, down 0.25 at 56.50.
	   Hong Kong's flag carrier Cathay Pacific gained 0.15 to 7.65.

Doctor: Police use `questionable' procedures in DNA tests
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with state DNA expert saying he received samples of
Anwar's body hair from police; NOTE sensitive language in grafs
18-19.
 &UR; AP Photos KL101-102
 &UR; By ALVIN UNG &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Police used ``highly
questionable'' procedures in collecting DNA samples from sacked
Deputy Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim, a state doctor testified
Tuesday in Anwar's sex and corruption trial.
	   Dr. Zahari Noor, a forensic expert at the state-run General
Hospital, the prosecution's 20th witness, testified that he took
blood samples from Anwar on Sept. 28th.
	   Anwar was at police headquarters, eight days after his arrest.
He agreed to give blood samples that were to be tested for the HIV
virus, hepatitis and venereal disease, Noor said.
	   Anwar was fired by Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad on Sept. 2,
after Mahathir deemed him morally unfit to lead the country. He is
on trial for abuse of power and will be tried separately on charges
of engaging in illegal sex acts, including sodomy.
	   Anwar has denied all the accusations against him, saying they
were trumped up to eliminate his challenge to Mahathir's 17-year
rule.
	   Noor testified Tuesday that Anwar never gave permission for his
blood to be tested for DNA. He said police demanded the blood more
than two months later so they could test it for DNA.
	   Defense attorney Christopher Fernando asked whether the blood
would still be viable for DNA testing.
	   ``The results of the DNA testing done on this sample would be
highly questionable,'' Noor said. ``The blood being sent after
about two and one-half months ... is an inordinate delay by any
standard.''
	   Noor said the blood cells containing the DNA would have perished
because no anti-clotting chemicals had been added to Anwar's
original blood samples.
	   When the prosecution went back to Noor, however, he conceded
``it's possible to obtain DNA from a substantially degraded blood
sample.''
	   On Monday, Dr. Halim Haji Manzar, a pathologist at General
Hospital, testified that the blood taken from Anwar was given
directly to police and they never had a chance to test it for
sexually transmitted diseases.
	   The prosecution was expected to put state DNA experts on the
stand to testify that DNA samples taken from Anwar matched those of
semen stains found on a mattress in an apartment where Anwar
allegedly carried on sexual trysts.
	   The defense, anticipating this tactic, is trying to show that at
no time did Anwar give permission for his blood to be tested for
DNA. Defense attorneys Monday implied that hair and semen samples
may have been taken from Anwar while he was unconscious after his
beating in police custody.
	   Fernando on Tuesday popped a question that led to strenuous
prosecution objection, which was overruled by trial judge Augustine
Paul.
	   He asked Noor: ``When you examined Sukma Darmawan, you found
that he had no homosexual history when you conducted an anal test
on him?''
	   Sukma, Anwar's adopted brother, was sentenced to six months in
jail on Sept. 19 after confessing that he allowed Anwar to sodomize
him in April. Homosexuality is a crime in this predominantly Muslim
nation.
	   Sukma, currently out on bail, says he was mentally and
physically abused by police and coerced into making a guilty plea,
which he is now appealing.
	   Noor testified that he examined Sukma on Sept. 9 and determined
there was no evidence of anal intercourse.
	   ``He denied any history of homosexual activity,'' Noor said.
``When I examined his private parts there was no evidence of
injuries, whether recent or old.''
	   The prosecution's next witness, Lim Kong Boon, a state DNA
expert, said police gave him several bags containing different
samples of Anwar's body hair obtained in November.
	   His department, which conducts DNA analysis, also received the
mattress and a pillow allegedly being used by Anwar during illegal
trysts, Lim said.
	   Lim pulled out a pair of white latex gloves and donned them in
court when he was asked to examine the samples. Paul, looking
bemused, asked Lim why he had to do that.
	   ``I'm the DNA man,'' replied Lim, drawing laughter from the
public gallery.
	   The day's proceedings were adjourned before Lim established
whether the DNA samples taken from Anwar actually matched the semen
stains found on the mattress.

Negotiations begin for release of 16 Western hostages
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By AHMAD AL-HAJ &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SAN`A, Yemen (AP) _ Yemeni officials on Tuesday started
negotiations with Islamic extremists for the release of 16 Western
tourists while security forces encircled the area where the
militants are said to be holding the hostages.
	   Gov. Ahmad Ali Mohsen of Abyan province, where the kidnapping
took place, is talking with leaders of the Al-Fadl tribe, to which
the kidnappers belong, an official at the governor's office said.
	   Mohsen is accompanied by Islamic personalities influential with
the abductors, the official said on condition of anonymity.
	   A security official said about 200 troops were deployed in Abyan
Tuesday.
	   The kidnapping occurred Monday near the southern town of
Mawdiyah, about 200 kilometers (175 miles) south of the capital,
San`a. The hostages include 12 Britons, six of them women, two
American women and two Australian men.
	   Britain's ambassador to Yemen, Victor Henderson, told Britain's
Sky News that the hostages are safe and well and no one has been
harmed.
	   Kidnapping of tourists by tribes is a commonly used method in
Yemen to gain concessions from the government such as new roads,
water supply or clinics. The hostages are usually released
unharmed.
	   But this is the first time an abduction has been carried out by
Islamic extremists. Security officials said the kidnappers belong
to Islamic Jihad, many of whose leaders fought in Afghanistan and
are believed to have connections with Egyptian Muslim radicals.
	   The group is demanding the release of its leader, Saleh Haidara
al-Atwi, who was arrested two weeks ago as part of a government
crackdown on Islamic vigilantes enforcing strict Islamic rules in
southern Yemen.
	   The kidnappers also are demanding the release of another leader,
security officials said. They did not identify him.
	   They said Islamic Jihad members flogged women for ignoring the
Islamic dress code and men for selling and drinking alcohol, which
is forbidden in Islam.
	   The group, which has no more than 200 members, also ran a
military camp in southern Yemen, said the officials, speaking on
condition of anonymity.
	   They said the kidnappers, who included 10 gunmen and eight
others, ambushed a convoy of five vehicles in which the tourists
were traveling and opened fire on a number of policemen escorting
them.
	   The gunmen threatened to kill the hostages if the police didn't
back off, said one official.
	   He said all the gunmen sported beards typical of Islamists and
had received military training.
	   During the melee, the British tour leader and a Yemeni guide
escaped and raised alarm.
	   The Australian Embassy in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, which handles
Yemen, said a diplomat was on his way to San`a Tuesday to try to
secure the release of the hostages.
	   A British couple and their teenage son were kidnapped in April
but released unharmed a month later.
	   Four Germans are also being held at present by a tribe in
northeast Yemen. The kidnappers are demanding more schools,
hospitals and telephone lines in their area.
	   Yemen was once a haven for Islamic militant fugitives from other
countries, but the government has expelled many of them.

Anti-trust panel fines 3 Italian networks over sports broadcasts
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ An anti-trust panel has levied a total of dlrs 1.5
million in fines against Italy's three largest television networks
on allegations they blocked free bidding on the rights to broadcast
sports events.
	   Monday's fines targeted state-owned RAI and private media groups
Cecchi Gori and Reti Televisive Italiane. RTI, the nation's largest
private television company, is controlled by media magnate and
opposition leader Silvio Berlusconi.
	   The anti-trust authority says RAI and RTI split the broadcast
rights to soccer matches, Formula One races and the Giro d'Italia
cycling race in 1996, shutting out Cecchi Gori.
	   In 1997, RAI., RTI and Cecchi Gori divided between them the
rights to broadcast Italian soccer matches for the next two
seasons, the panel said.
	   RAI and RTI said they would appeal. The two called the fines
unfounded, saying the 1996 accord was never carried out and that
the 1997 accord had the approval of Italy's soccer league.
	   The fines come as Italy's two, emerging pay-TV networks try to
break into the sports broadcast market, vying for the lucrative
broadcast rights to Italian soccer.
	   One, Tele Piu, is 10 percent controlled by Berlusconi's
companies; the other, Stream, is the subject of a still-pending
deal that would sell a majority stake to Rupert Murdoch's media
empire.

	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Authorities recovered the bodies of
four sailors and gave up hope Tuesday of finding two others after a
monstrous storm decimated the Sydney-to-Hobart yacht race, its
90-mph (145-kph) winds and 35-foot (10.5-meter) swells snapping
masts and flipping boats over.
	   A former British Olympic sailor and an Australian competitor
were missing and presumed drowned, Australian Maritime Safety
Authority spokesman Brian Hill said.
	   ``We wouldn't stop searching for them if we thought they were
still alive,'' Hill told The Associated Press. ``It's tragic but
most people would realize that we do have to be realistic.''
	   Australian officials on Tuesday halted one of the country's
largest maritime rescue operations ever after finding the bodies of
four sailors over two days. Military helicopters plucked about 50
other sailors to safety off Australia's southeastern coast, 250
miles (400 kilometers) south of Sydney.
	   The race continued, however, finishing Tuesday morning when
American Larry Ellison and his maxi yacht Sayonara arrived in
Hobart, Tasmania, to take line honors ahead of Brindabella.
Ellison, the chief executive officer and founder of Oracle Corp.,
also won the race in 1995.
	   The 23-member crew arrived at Constitution Dock to a funereal
atmosphere, rather than the usual popping of champagne corks and
booming of cannons.
	   ``It was just awful. I've never experienced anything remotely
like this,'' Ellison said of the raging seas that peaked Sunday and
Monday.
	   ``It's been a very emotional experience to get here. This is not
what this is supposed to be about. It's a tough crew, but the guys
were choked up.''
	   One of the missing sailors, 33-year-old Briton Glyn Charles, had
represented Britain in the Star Class at the 1996 Summer Olympics
in Atlanta, where he finished 11th.
	   The other missing sailor was Australian John Dean, a crew member
on the yacht Winston Churchill, which sank.
	   The bodies of two other Winston Churchill crew members, Jim
Lawler and Michael Bannister, were found Tuesday.
	   Two other sailors were found dead Monday after the 40-foot
(12-meter) boat Business Post Naiad capsized 60 miles (96
kilometers) off the New South Wales town of Merimbula. The dead
were both Australians: the yacht's owner-skipper Bruce Guy and
crewman Phil Skeggs.
	   The four confirmed deaths from the storm have already made this
the deadliest Sydney-to-Hobart race.
	   Prior to this week's carnage, there had been only two reported
deaths in the 54-year history of Australia's greatest yacht race.
The 725-mile (1,160-kilometer) race starts the day after Christmas
and attracts top-class sailors and yachts from around the world.
	   Of the 115 yachts that entered this year, 70 withdrew from the
race. Six boats were abandoned or sank.
	   Race organizers said a full inquiry would be held into the
world's worst yachting disaster since the Fastnet race off Ireland
in 1979, in which 15 sailors died.
	   Helicopters hovered over 35-foot (10.5-meter) swells to hoist
dozens of sailors to safety. Many of the crew members were injured
_ with broken bones, dislocated shoulders, cuts on the face and
hands _ from being struck by broken rigging or tossed upside down
when their boats capsized.
	   The bodies of Lawler and Bannister were winched Tuesday from a
9-foot (2.7-meter) swell. Navy helicopter pilot Tanzi Lea found
them two miles (3.2 kilometers) apart and 50 miles (80 kilometers)
offshore.
	   The three Winston Churchill crew members disappeared after six
of their crew mates were plucked from two life rafts in the 30-foot
(9-meter) seas of Bass Strait.
	   Helicopter pilot Nic Trimmer said the three were washed away by
a single wave.
	   Winston Churchill skipper Richard Winning, who was rescued off
one of the boat's life rafts, told of a frantic struggle to stay
alive.
	   ``After we got into the life raft and became separated from the
others, the damned thing capsized twice on these great seas at
night, which is bloody frightening, let me tell you,'' Winning
said.
	   Chris Dickson, helmsman of the first-place Sayonara, said his
boat's crew was thinking more about the sailors in trouble than the
victory.
	   ``Being here first is nice, but being here at all is a big
thing, and we're thinking about those who are still out there, not
thinking too much about how we've done,'' Dickson said.
	   ``Anyone who is not scared in those conditions is not human,''
he added.

China says no more balloon overflights, for now
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ China is withholding permission for balloons to
cross its airspace, after British tycoon Richard Branson and his
teammates drifted off course during their failed round-the-world
attempt, the Foreign Ministry said Tuesday.
	   China had earlier approved overflights by three round-the-world
balloon teams, but is now suspending permission, Foreign Ministry
spokesman Zhu Bangzao said.
	   Asked when China might permit more overflights, he replied: ``It
depends. Well, you can wait for the notification.''
	   Branson, American millionaire Steve Fossett and Per Lindstrand
of Sweden were originally granted permission to cross China below
26 degrees north latitude. However, the trio drifted further north
than planned. Following diplomatic appeals from Britain, the
balloonists were allowed to continue flying.
	   Caught in poor weather, the team splashed down off Hawaii on
Friday.
	   Following the problems with that flight, ``the Chinese side has
postponed the permission of balloons flying through Chinese
airspace,'' Zhu said.
	   A Swiss-based team last week postponed its round-the-world
attempt because China withdrew permission. The Swiss government is
now negotiating with China to obtain clearance for the balloon,
piloted by Bertrand Piccard.
	   Piccard's last bid also was abandoned after China refused his
balloon entry, causing it to miss out on jet-stream winds needed to
speed it over the Pacific.
	   Another attempt at the balloon record was stalled Monday by
strong winds over the Re/Max team's launch pad in Alice Springs,
Australia. Other teams plan take-offs from Chicago and Albuquerque,
N.M.

them two miles (3.2 kilometers) apart and 50 miles (80 kilometers)
offshore.
	   The three Winston Churchill crew members disappeared after six
of their crew mates were plucked from two life rafts in the 30-foot
(9-meter) seas of Bass Strait.
	   Helicopter pilot Nic Trimmer said the three were washed away by
a single wave.
	   Winston Churchill skipper Richard Winning, who was rescued off
one of the boat's life rafts, told of a frantic struggle to stay
alive.
	   ``After we got into the life raft and became separated from the
others, the damned thing capsized twice on these great seas at
night, which is bloody frightening, let me tell you,'' Winning
said.
	   Chris Dickson, helmsman of the first-place Sayonara, said his
boat's crew was thinking more about the sailors in trouble than the
victory.
	   ``Being here first is nice, but being here at all is a big
thing, and we're thinking about those who are still out there, not
thinking too much about how we've done,'' Dickson said.
	   ``Anyone who is not scared in those conditions is not human,''
he added.

Negotiations begin for release of 16 Western hostages
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By AHMAD AL-HAJ &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SAN`A, Yemen (AP) _ Yemeni officials started negotiations
Tuesday with Islamic extremists for the release of 16 Western
tourists as security forces encircled the area where the militants
are said to be holding the hostages.
	   Gov. Ahmad Ali Mohsen of Abyan province, where the kidnappings
occurred, is talking with leaders of the Al-Fadl tribe, an official
at the governor's office said. Mohsen was accompanied by Islamic
personalities influential with the abductors, the official said on
condition of anonymity.
	   A security official said about 200 troops were deployed Tuesday
in Abyan.
	   Tribes often kidnap tourists in Yemen to gain government
concessions such as new roads, water supply or clinics. The
hostages are usually released unharmed.
	   This was the first time an abduction has been carried out by
Islamic extremists. Security officials said the kidnappers belong
to Islamic Jihad, many of whose leaders fought in Afghanistan and
are believed to have connections with Egyptian Muslim radicals.
	   The kidnapping occurred Monday near the southern town of
Mawdiyah, about 200 kilometers (175 miles) south of the capital,
San`a. The hostages include 12 Britons, six of them women, two
American women and two Australian men.
	   Britain's ambassador to Yemen, Victor Henderson, told Britain's
Sky News that none of the hostages has been harmed.
	   The group is demanding the release of its leader, Saleh Haidara
al-Atwi, who was arrested two weeks ago as part of a government
crackdown on Islamic vigilantes enforcing strict Islamic rules in
southern Yemen. The kidnappers also want the release of another
leader, said security officials who did not identify him.
	   They said Islamic Jihad members flog women for ignoring the
Islamic dress code and men for selling and drinking alcohol, which
is forbidden in Islam. The group, which has no more than 200
members, also ran a military camp in southern Yemen, officials
said.
	   The kidnappers, who included 10 gunmen and eight others,
ambushed a convoy of five vehicles in which the tourists were
traveling and opened fire on a number of policemen escorting them,
officials said.
	   The gunmen threatened to kill the hostages if the police didn't
back off, said one official.
	   He said all the gunmen sported beards typical of Islamists and
had military training.
	   During the melee, the British tour leader and a Yemeni guide
escaped.
	   The Australian Embassy in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, which handles
Yemen, said a diplomat was on his way to San`a on Tuesday to try to
secure the release of the hostages.
	   In April, a British couple and their teen-age son were kidnapped
but released unharmed a month later.
	   Four Germans are also being held at present by a tribe in
northeast Yemen. The kidnappers are demanding more schools,
hospitals and telephone lines in their area.
	   Yemen was once a haven for Islamic militant fugitives from other
countries, but the government has expelled many of them.

England wins fourth test
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS; ADDS details, quotes &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) _ Paceman Dean Headley destroyed
Australia's middle order to deliver England a thrilling 12-run
victory in the fourth test at the MCG on Tuesday.
	   Although Australia has retained the Ashes, England kept its
hopes alive of squaring the series being down 2-1 with one to play.
	   Australia's tail folded dramatically as the team chased 175 for
victory on the fourth afternoon, losing 7-32 after reaching 130 for
three.
	   Headley claimed a career-best 6-60 and made the decisive move
when he had Darren Lehmann, Ian Healy and Damien Fleming out in the
space of 12 balls with the total stuck on 140.
	   ``I can't believe it,'' said Headley. ``It looked like slipping
away but we did it.''
	   Steve Waugh, who scored a brilliant century in the first
innings, was stranded at the non-striker's end on 30 as Australia
lost its last three wickets for one run.
	   Darren Gough ended the match by bowling Stuart MacGill and
following up with the wicket of Glenn McGrath in the same over.
	   ``I was so excited and pleased that we'd done it after everyone
had written us off and said how bad we are,'' Gough said. ``We went
out to play positive cricket because when we do that we can beat
anyone in the world.''
	   After the first day was lost entirely to rain the other three
days were extended.
	   Australia needed 18 for victory and had three wickets in hand
when it opted to play an extra half an hour Tuesday, offered under
the rules when a result is imminent.
	   The English players clearly did not want to stay on the field,
with captain Alec Stewart arguing with the umpires, but the extra
time worked in their favor.
	   The key to England's win was the performance of its
much-maligned tail end batsmen earlier Tuesday. They carried the
score to 244 along with 60 from Graeme Hick.
	   No.11 Alan Mullally, who had five ducks from six previous test
innings this series, even helped out and riled rival paceman Glenn
McGrath by hitting him for consecutive fours in an innings of 16.
	   Australia made a poor start to its chase, losing Michael Slater
and Mark Taylor inside 11 overs while Hick dropped a chance to put
England in control when he spilled a catch from Justin Langer with
41 still on the board.
	   But Langer was removed by a brilliant catch at square leg by
Mark Ramprakash, diving away to his right, and the dismissal
appeared to galvanize the fielding team.
	   ``Throughout the series you are looking for little moments of
inspiration, things that lift everyone. I thought that catch lifted
us,'' said England coach David Lloyd.
	   ``It is a daft game but it keeps everybody going. I thought it
was a great game of cricket and at the end there are winners and
losers.''
	   Headley, whose father Ron and grandfather George Headley played
tests for the West Indies, then tore through Australia's middle
order to send England's infamous supporters, the Barmy Army,
delirious.
	   Long after stumps the traveling fans continued singing outside
the England dressingroom.
	   	   ``Who can't celebrate? We're cricketers, not footballers,'' said
Gough of planned parties ahead of the Jan. 2 fifth test.
	   ``We'll enjoy the win because it's been a great effort. We've
proved this game that we can play cricket, we just need to do it
more often.''
	   Australian captain Mark Taylor said too many of his batsmen
squandered good starts.
	   ``I thought we'd won it but we got a bit lazy. No one made a big
enough score,'' Taylor said.

Suharto's second son questioned over charitable foundation
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ State prosecutors on Tuesday
questioned a son of ex-President Suharto as part of a corruption
investigation of the former authoritarian leader.
	   President B.J. Habibie ordered the investigation of his
predecessor and onetime mentor after coming under pressure from
student protesters who want Suharto be put on trial. Suharto quit
in May after riots and protests against his 32-year rule.
	   Prosecutors have been scrutinizing seven charitable foundations
owned by Suharto that were allegedly used in part to collect money
that his family used for its own benefit.
	   Suharto, who denies any wrongdoing, has since handed control of
the foundations to the government.
	   One of Suharto's three sons, businessman Bambang Trihatmodjo,
was questioned about his activities as chairman of one of the
foundations, Dana Sejahtera Mandiri. He did not comment after
questioning at the attorney general's office.
	   News reports said the foundation has 1.3 trillion (dlrs 173
million) in cash.
	   While critics maintain the probe is largely cosmetic, Attorney
General Andi Mohamad Ghalib has said Suharto might be named a
suspect, a legal move that would bring him a step closer to trial.
	   Also under scrutiny are a national car project run by another of
Suharto's son with huge tax breaks and presidential decrees that
allegedly benefited the former president's family and friends.
	   Prosecutors in the Suharto investigation are expected to finish
their questioning of witnesses early next year.
	   Suharto, whose authority was eroded by his failure to revive
Indonesia's shattered economy, has been accused of using his
position and connections to help his six children build huge
business empires.
	   The Indonesian Observer on Tuesday reported that Suharto and his
family own concessions to almost 9 million hectares (22,230,000
acres) of forest land in Indonesia as well as 205,000 hectares
(506,000 acres) of prime real estate.
	   The newspaper quoted Land Affairs Minister Hasan Basri Durin as
saying the land is owned by companies in which the Suharto clan
controls at least 80 percent of the shares.

South Korea posts dlrs 3.33 billion current account surplus in
</HEADLINE>
November

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ Sharply falling imports helped South
Korea post a dlrs 3.33 billion current account surplus in November,
the central Bank of Korea said in a preliminary report Tuesday.
	   November's gain pushed the nation's combined current account
surplus for the first eleven months of this year to dlrs 37.24
billion, compared with a deficit of dlrs 11.75 billion during the
same period last year.
	   November's gain was the nation's 13th consecutive monthly gain.
It compared with a dlrs 860 million surplus during the same month
last year.
	   Exports fell 4.5 percent to dlrs 11.6 billion but imports
plunged 29.7 percent to dlrs 8.1 billion.
	   Imports have dropped sharply in recent months as businesses
slashed capital investment and consumers spent less amid the
country's economic crisis.

Greek, Greek-Cypriot leaders hold crucial talks on missiles
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Greeks and Greek Cypriots held crucial
talks in Athens Tuesday geared towards defusing a political crisis
which developed after Cyprus decided to deploy Russian-made
missiles.
	   Both Cypriot President Glafcos Clerides and Greek Premier Costas
Simitis gave nothing away after their meeting, but a joint
communique was expected later in the day.
	   Speculation has increased that the two sides will agree to
divert the S-300 anti-aircraft missiles to the southern Greek
island of Crete, instead of deploying them on Cyprus as has been
planned for sometime in the next few weeks.
	   Such a move could defuse tensions with neighboring Turkey, which
has threatened military action to stop the missiles' deployment on
war-divided Cyprus, claiming they pose a threat to its security.
	   The United States and NATO have criticized Clerides' decision
two years ago to purchase the missiles, fearing conflict between
alliance members Turkey and Greece. Athens has a defense pact with
Nicosia and would be obliged to come to its aid in the event of an
attack.
	   Cyprus has been divided into a Greek Cypriot-controlled south
and a Turkish-occupied north since 1974 when Turkey invaded after a
short-lived coup by supporters of union with Greece.
	   The missiles issue has also caused political tensions in Cyprus,
where the outcome of Tuesday's meeting could affect the survival of
Clerides' government.
	   The Socialist EDEK party, which holds the ministries of defense
and education in Clerides' cabinet, has warned it will withdraw
from the government if the missiles are not deployed as planned.
	   Other opposition parties maintain Clerides should himself
resign, following his promise to do so if the missiles fail to
arrive.
	   The Cypriot president had said previously that he would agree to
the cancellation of the deployment of the missiles only if Turkey
accepted his demilitarization proposal, or if there was progress in
the U.N.-sponsored talks for the reunification of the island.
	   A U.N. Security Council resolution adopted unanimously last week
called for a reduction of weapons and troops in Cyprus and the
resumption of the talks.
	   Athens has said the final say for the missiles' deployment rests
with Nicosia, although it has stressed it will support any decision
made by Cyprus.

More than 100 would-be immigrants from Kosovo, elsewhere reach

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ More than 100 illegal refugees fleeing violence or
hardship at home reached Italy's southern shores in rubber dinghies
Tuesday, police said.
	   Encouraged by calm seas, hundreds of immigrants from Kosovo,
Iraq and northern Africa have been making the journey across the
Adriatic in recent days.
	   Renewed fighting between Serbs and ethnic Albanian rebels in
Kosovo also has sent the number of ethnic Albanian arrivals
soaring.
	   At least 27 of Tuesday's arrivals were from Kosovo.
	   The 101 would-be immigrants were taken to detention centers in
the region of Puglia, at the ``heel'' of the Italian peninsula,
near where the refugees reached shore. Authorities must now decide
whether to grant the immigrants residency documents or send them
back home.
	   Police said they detained two Albanians suspected of smuggling
immigrants and drugs across the Adriatic.
	   Most would-be immigrant see Italy as a gateway to relatives and
jobs in northern Europe and pay smugglers large sums of money to
make the trip.
	   To avoid being caught by navy and coast guard patrols, the
smugglers often abandon their charges in the seas off the Italian
coast and some refugees die trying to swim ashore.
	   On Monday, Italy renewed complaints that Albania was doing
little to stop the exodus.

China's legislature approves first national securities law
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS Li Peng quote in graf 7, state firms and banks banned
from stock trading in graf 5

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ After years of debate and bureaucratic
infighting, the top committee of China's legislature approved
Tuesday a national law to police the country's freewheeling
securities markets.
	   The Standing Committee of the National People's Congress adopted
the law on the last day of a six-day session. The law will take
effect July 1, 1999, the state-run Xinhua News Agency reported.
	   It said the 12-chapter, 214-article law governs all aspects of
the securities industry, from the issue and trading of stocks to
purchases of listed companies, registration and accounts settlement
agencies, government regulatory bodies and penalties for violating
the law.
	   The new law retains a prohibition already in force against
foreign investors buying shares in China's A-share market, which is
open only to domestic investors, Xinhua said. Foreign investors
remain limited to the smaller, less active B-share market.
	   The law also will ban Chinese banks and state companies from
equities trading. With core businesses crumbling, state-owned
companies have poured unknown billions of yuan (dollars) into
China's stock markets looking for higher returns on investments.
Chinese banks have also financed stock purchases through loans, or
have shifted their own cash in and out of volatile markets.
	   The securities industry will be separated into two tiers, with
brokerages required to separate their own trading accounts from
those of their clients. Securities firms are also to be kept
separate from banking, trust and insurance businesses, it added.
	   The report said legislators had drawn lessons from the financial
turmoil afflicting other Asian markets in formulating the law.
	   Li Peng, who heads the legislature, said the law would be
important in ``protecting the legitimate rights and interests of
investors, preventing and resolving financial risk and guaranteeing
the healthy development of China's fledgling securities market,''
Xinhua said.
	   At least five earlier draft versions of the law had been debated
and rejected during the past six years, mainly due to disagreements
between the various bureaucracies responsible for enforcing market
regulations.
	   The regional crisis may have finally pushed the legislature into
approving the law, which codifies and unifies a hodgepodge of
regulations that have been loosely enforced.
	   Legislative debate over the securities law led to late revisions
to firm regulations prohibiting state-owned companies or listed
companies from trading shares, the newspaper China Securities News
reported Tuesday.
	   Investors who own 30 percent or more of a listed company's
shares will be required to issue a takeover notice to all
shareholders, the paper said.
	   The new law is expected to help prevent the frequent trading
irregularities and bouts of volatility that have troubled the stock
exchanges and other financial markets since their inception in the
early 1990s.
	   In the latest case, the China Securities Regulatory Commission
is investigating alleged illegal transactions by the investment
banking unit of Shenyin Wanguo Securities Co., the country's second
biggest brokerage, company officials told Dow Jones Newswires
Monday.
	   The probe could result in a suspension of Shenyin Wanguo's
underwriting credentials, a lucrative source of income, as well as
a shakeup among the firm's management, they said.
	   There are now about 827 companies listed on China's stock
exchanges in Shanghai and Shenzhen, with total market
capitalization of more than 2 trillion yuan (dlrs 242.1 billion).

Artists concerned about rising threat of fundamentalism in Indian

	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ Militant intolerance has threatened
artistic creativity across the Indian subcontinent, actors and
artists warned Tuesday.
	   In India, Hindu militants halted the screening of a film
depicting lesbian love. In Pakistan, independent theater was
unofficially banned for two decades of military rule. In
Bangladesh, a female writer faces death threats from Islamic
extremists for promoting women's rights.
	   Nationalism, communalism, sectarianism, and totalitarianism have
been joined by a new ``ism'' in nearby Afghanistan, Talibanism,
named for the ruling extreme Islamic Taliban.
	   Fundamentalism ``poses a serious challenge to creativity in the
21st century,'' said Pakistani writer Kishwar Naheed.
	   About 200 people participated Tuesday in the session during a
five-day convention organized by Sahmat, an organization of artists
and scholars. Because of her country's rivalry with India, Naheed
said she was not given approval to attend the conference until 15
minutes before her flight left.
	   Shabana Azmi, an actress who also is a member of Parliament,
warned that Hindu nationalism has put freedom of expression and the
rule of law under a cloud.
	   Hindu activists vandalized theaters showing Azmi's latest film,
``Fire,'' the story of two unhappily married woman within a single
joint family who turn to each other for love.
	   Azmi said the top elected official of the Maharashtra state
government congratulated activists from his right-wing party who
attacked theaters screening ``Fire.'' The same government, acting
under court orders, provided her armed guards to protect her from
the extremists, she said.
	   ``Distorting facts is the hallmark of the fundamentalists,''
said Shameem Akhtar, a Bangladesh human rights activist who
complained that Muslim ideologues were becoming entrenched in the
government bureaucracy.
	   Anand Patwardhan, an Indian film maker, said the people should
take up cultural activism to counter the threat of intolerance.
``We have to keep challenging nationalism as something different
from what is perceived by the rightist forces.''

Loyalist forces lose fight for Sierra Leone town
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   FREETOWN, Sierra Leone (AP) _ Rebel forces battling to oust
President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah have taken control of the central town
of Makeni, defense force officers acknowledged Tuesday.
	   The town had been the scene of heavy fighting in recent days,
with rebel fighters battling against defense forces from a West
African coalition army.
	   The coalition force, known as ECOMOG, withdrew from Makeni in
what was called a ``tactical retreat,'' according to an ECOMOG
statement.
	   Sierra Leone's Foreign Minister Sam Banya on Monday said
virtually the entire population of several thousand people had fled
Makeni.
	   The rebel Revolutionary United Front has launched a series of
offensives in recent weeks to recapture ground lost to ECOMOG
troops earlier in the year.
	   The Nigerian-led ECOMOG force was used in February to oust from
power a military junta with ties to the RUF. The West African
intervention force has stayed on in Sierra Leone to help defend
Kabbah's elected government.
	   Earlier, rebel leaders said they had taken control of Makeni, a
strategic town in central Sierra Leone about 120 kilometers (75
miles) northeast of Freetown.
	   Diplomats from West Africa, the United States and Britain
meeting in the Ivory Coast on Monday called for more aid to help
defend Sierra Leone's embattled government.
	   Nigeria has assumed the vast majority of responsibilities for
ECOMOG, while Ghana and Guinea have also sent troops. The United
States and Britain have provided logistical support for the
regional task force.
	   Rebel units, however, claim to have closed to within 20
kilometers (12 miles) of the capital and have threatened to start
shelling the city.
	   Banya said mercenaries from Liberia, Burkina Faso and the
Ukraine were fighting alongside the rebels. That claim could not be
independently confirmed.
	   ``The rebels must cease fighting immediately, lay down their
arms and accept President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah's government as the
sole legitimate government,'' the ECOWAS statement said.

Two exiled dissidents sent to Chinese labor camps
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Two U.S.-based Chinese dissidents who sneaked
back into China were caught by police and sentenced without trial
to three years of forced labor, the Foreign Ministry said Tuesday.
	   The ministry's brief statement was the first official word on
the whereabouts of Zhang Lin and Wei Quanbao since they slipped
into China seven weeks ago.
	   Members of their families asked the Chinese Consulate in New
York on Monday to help locate the pair, but consular officials were
evasive, according to an account by Chinese dissidents in New York
faxed to foreign news agencies in Beijing.
	   The Foreign Ministry said police arrested Zhang and Wei in the
southern provincial capital of Guangzhou in a barber shop operating
as a front for prostitution on Nov. 12.
	   The statement said the two men confessed to hiring prostitutes
and evading border police by hiding inside a truck entering the
city of Shenzhen from Hong Kong on Nov. 11. For those alleged
crimes, police sentenced the two to three years of ``labor
reeducation.''
	   The three-year term is the maximum police are allowed to order
without a trial.
	   Zhang, 35, is a veteran democracy and labor rights campaigner.
He served two stints in prisons and labor camps for a total of five
years between 1989 and 1997 for his campaigning.
	   After his sentence ended last year, Zhang went to the United
States. Wei, 38, went to the United States in 1994. Both reportedly
have U.S. residence permits.
	   The Foreign Ministry identified Zhang and Wei as members of the
China Democratic Justice Party, ``a hostile foreign organization.''
They ``engaged in activities to oppose the Chinese government while
in the United States,'' the statement said.
	   The party was set up early this year by Wang Bingzhang, a
prominent exile, to unite dissidents overseas and in China to
challenge the ruling Communist Party. Earlier this year, the group
claimed to have 100 members in as many as 10 branches in China.
	   A Hong Kong-based group, the Information Center of Human Rights
and Democratic Movement in China, reported last week that Zhang and
Wei had renounced their ties to exile groups advocating democracy.

Regional leaders to meet to assess progress of cooperation
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ARUSHA, Tanzania (AP) _ The heads of state of the three
countries forming the East African Cooperation are scheduled to
meet Jan. 22 to review progress of the trading bloc and a request
from Rwanda to join the group, an official said Tuesday.
	   The official, a member of the EAC secretariat who asked not to
be further identified, said the meeting would deal with upgrading
the current cooperation agreement into a full-fledged treaty and
the release of the much-delayed East African passports.
	   Tanzania, Kenya and Uganda make up the EAT, which replaces the
old East African Community that collapsed in 1977, partly because
of a divergence in economic policies pursued by the three countries
and lack of adequate mechanisms to deal with problems of economic
integration.
	   In its heyday, the community had a common airlines, railway,
postal system and currency.
	   When Presidents Benjamin Mkapa, Daniel arap Moi and Yoweri
Museveni last met in April 1997, the launched the East African
Cooperation Development Strategy (1997-2000), a policy document
that lays the basis for the rapid economic integration of the
partner states.
	   The January summit is also expected to focus on the progress
made in establishing a Single Market and Investment Area for the
three member states, all of which now subscribe to pro-market,
pro-private sector and liberal economic policies.
	   Arusha in northern Tanzania is the seat of the EAC secretariat.

IMF: More than half of income of Italy's small businesses goes
</HEADLINE>
undeclared &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ More than half the income from Italy's small
businesses goes undeclared, the International Monetary Fund says in
a scathing report on the nation's endemic tax dodging.
	   Overall, tax evasion costs the government an amount equivalent
to 12.6 percent of Italy's gross domestic product, said the IMF
study, released Monday in Rome. That's about dlrs 1.5 billion.
	   Italy always has had a robust underground economy run by
energetic workers who hide their profits from what they protest are
the government's exorbitant tax rates. Even with tax evasion,
Italy's total tax haul amounts to 43.6 percent of gross domestic
product, above the European Union average of 42.6 percent,
according to the IMF study.
	   The IMF named small- and medium-sized businesses as the chief
tax evaders, saying 58 percent of the income of small businesses
goes unreported to the government.
	   It also laid blame on Italy's sizable self-employed sector.
About 29 percent of Italy's workers are self-employed _ almost
three times the number in Germany and more than twice that of
France's.
	   That prevalence of small or self-run enterprises ``make it
easier to declare lower incomes than are really earned,'' the IMF
noted.

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Shielded from trial by Prime
Minister Hun Sen, two top Khmer Rouge leaders came to Phnom Penh on
Tuesday and said it was time to forget their brutal rule in the
1970s, which left as many as 2 million people dead.
	   Hun Sen greeted Khieu Samphan and Nuon Chea, part of the inner
circle of late Khmer Rouge chief Pol Pot, with handshakes and
smiles after cementing their defection _ in essence, a surrender _
with public pledges not to try them for genocide.
	   They were flown by helicopter from Pailin, a former rebel
stronghold, to Hun Sen's residence on a military base outside the
capital. After five hours of talks, they checked in at the Phnom
Penh hotel where they were booked for the night.
	   ``This is the end of the Khmer Rouge,'' Khieu Samphan told a mob
of waiting reporters. ``I discussed with His Excellency Hun Sen
that we must forget the past in order to reach national
reconciliation, peace and stability so we can we rebuild our
country.''
	   Neither looked well after months on the run while Khmer Rouge
territory fell under government control. Nuon Chea, 71, walked with
a cane. Khieu Samphan, 67, needed help up the stairs.
	   Khieu Samphan's normally white hair was dyed black in an
apparent attempt at disguise.
	   A truckload of military police stood guard outside the hotel.
Reporters asked Khieu Samphan if he feared becoming the first Khmer
Rouge leader to be put on trial for crimes against humanity.
	   ``It is up to the Cambodian people to pronounce on this
matter,'' Khieu Samphan said.
	   Nuon Chea added: ``We're glad to make a contribution to national
reconciliation.''
	   They later paid a call on Prince Norodom Ranariddh, president of
the National Assembly and son of King Norodom Sihanouk. Hun Sen
says that both have approved of the defections.
	   Speaking to the British Broadcasting Corp. from Sweden, Thomas
Hammarberg, U.N. Special Representative for Human Rights in
Cambodia, said it would be ``extremely sad'' if the pair were not
charged and tried for crimes against humanity.
	   In the meeting with Hun Sen, they posed for pictures with Ieng
Sary, a Khmer Rouge leader pardoned in 1996 for his role in
genocide in exchange for making peace and leading thousands of
guerrillas out of a stalemated civil war.
	   Leading members of the Cambodian People's Party _ led by people
who, like Hun Sen, were once Khmer Rouge cadres before fleeing
bloody purges in the late 1970s _ joined the meeting.
	   In exchange for ending their part in the war _ all but over for
more than a year anyway _ Hun Sen said Monday he would not try
Khieu Samphan or Nuon Chea, slamming the door on international
pressure to bring them before a tribunal overseas or a Cambodian
court.
	   ``If we bring them to trial, it will not benefit the nation, it
will only mean a return to civil war,'' Hun Sen told the Cabinet.
``We should dig a hole and bury the past and look toward the
future.''
	   Khieu Samphan and Nuon Chea have been sheltered for several days
in Pailin, an ex-rebel stronghold nominally under government
control but run by Ieng Sary.
	   It was Nuon Chea's first visit to the capital since the Khmer
Rouge were overthrown in 1979 by a Vietnamese invasion. Khieu
Samphan came to Phnom Penh in 1991 after a peace treaty _ later
broken by the Khmer Rouge _ was signed. He was stoned by a Hun
Sen-controlled mob.
	   In the past two years, granting pardons to Khmer Rouge leaders
ended their war and gave Cambodia new hope of rebuilding. But now,
calls are rising from Cambodians, the United States and other
countries for someone to be held accountable.
	   The Maoist revolutionaries won a civil war in 1975 and forced
Cambodians into slave labor camps. About one person in five
perished from overwork, starvation, disease and executions.
	   Khieu Samphan was the nominal leader, though he is generally
viewed as a front-man for those with real power. Nuon Chea was seen
as Pol Pot's second-in-command and chief political theorist.
	   Former members of the inner circle who have defected tend to
place all blame on Pol Pot, who died in April of a heart attack.
	   Khieu Samphan said he had separated ``a long time ago'' from the
only chieftain still at large: Ta Mok, known as ``The Butcher,''
who is somewhere on the Thai border with perhaps 100 die-hard
loyalists.

Landslide, flood kill five in Central Java
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ At least five villagers in Central
Java have bee killed as torrential rains in recent days triggered
landslides and floods, a news report said Tuesday.
	   Four of the dead were members of a family buried by a landslide
Monday morning in Duren village in Banjarnegara regency, about 340
kilometers (210 miles) southeast of Jakarta.
	   The fifth victim was a 30-year-old woman whose body was found
later Monday after she was swept away by the Cirongkang river in
the nearby district of Banyumas, reported the official Antara news
agency.
	   The agency said at least 3,000 houses in 18 villages and
hundreds of hectares of rice fields were destroyed by flood waters
which reached a height of two-meters.
	   Floods triggered by incessant rains also inundated hundreds of
houses in Samarinda, East Kalimantan, Antara said.

Pakistan arrests seven alleged members of an international heroin

smuggling ring &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   KARACHI, Pakistan (AP) _ Pakistani authorities arrested seven
members of an alleged international heroin smuggling ring that sent
heroin to European countries through mail envelops, a senior
official of the anti-narcotics force said Tuesday.
	   During last 13 years, the gang smuggled around 3 tons of heroin
worth billions of rupees (dollars) in envelops that contained 5 to
10 grams or more of heroin powder, said Mukhtar Ahmed, director
general of Anti-Narcotics Task Force Sindh.
	   The arrests were made this week after several months of
investigations. The gang leader remained at large, Ahmed said.
	   Poppy is cultivated in Pakistan's northern areas bordering
Afghanistan. Most heroin manufacturing factories also operate in
the border areas of the two countries.
	   The government launched a massive crackdown on poppy fields
recently, but has been unable to destroy them completely because of
resistance from local population.
	   Ahmed said chemicals for heroin manufacturing are being smuggled
from European countries to Pakistan.
	   The government has taken strict steps to stop heroin smuggling.
It seized 175 kilograms of heroin powder and 173 ton of hashish in
1998 just in southern Sindh province, he said.

German bank president sees more competition with euro
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BERLIN (AP) _ The introduction of a single currency could create
jobs by stimulating sharper competition among European regions,
German central bank president Hans Tietmeyer said Tuesday.
	   If the 11 states adopting the euro Jan. 1 live up to the new
competition, it could very well lead to additional investment, more
dynamism _ and more jobs, he said in an interview in
DeutschlandRadio Berlin.
	   Tietmeyer also noted that with the advent of the euro, national
problems, such as unemployment, will no longer be able to be solved
through exchange rates.
	   He stressed the need for greater political cooperation among the
11 euro nations.
	   ``We need a higher degree of political cooperation on the
European level,'' Tietmeyer said. ``If everyone takes a separate
path, this could lead to conflict with supranational monetary
policy.''

Defense chief: Russia can build new heavy nuclear missile if
</HEADLINE>
needed &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Despite severe economic problems, Russia is still
strong enough to develop a new nuclear missile if necessary,
Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev said in an interview published
Tuesday.
	   ``The talk about our weakness is an overstatement,'' Sergeyev
said in an interview published in the daily Segodnya. ``If we need,
we may build a heavy missile.''
	   Sergeyev was responding to a question about what the military
would do if Russia's parliament does not ratify the START II arms
reduction treaty, under which Russia and the United States are to
reduce their nuclear forces.
	   Sergeyev and other military leaders have strongly supported
START II, saying that by the year 2007, the treaty's deadline for
halving Russian and U.S. arsenals to 3,000-3,500 warheads each,
Russia's aging heavy missiles will have to be decommissioned
anyway.
	   Sergeyev appeared to reiterate his support for the treaty on
Tuesday, but said Moscow can maintain a credible nuclear force and
develop new missiles if necessary.
	   ``Why should we go back to the past? The number of warheads
doesn't determine anything,'' he said.
	   Russia and the United States signed START II in 1993, and the
U.S. Senate approved it in 1996. The Communist-dominated Russian
parliament has delayed ratification, claiming the treaty would
damage Russia's security.
	   Lawmakers appeared ready to approve the treaty earlier this
month, but again delayed ratification until next spring to protest
U.S. and British air strikes against Iraq.
	   Sergeyev and other government officials have condemned the
strikes on Iraq.
	   ``We aren't going to have a confrontation with America,''
Sergeyev said in the interview. ``But we couldn't keep quiet, since
that (raids on Iraq) was a step away from law and toward primeval
society.''
	   ``I don't know what our tough stance will bring, but I'm sure
that it will be taken into account. Many are applauding us under
the table,'' he said.

Israeli general says it's `unnatural' for women to be pilots
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ An Israeli air force general told a
parliamentary committee that it was ``unnatural'' for women to be
pilots, sparking outrage among female legislators.
	   Legislator Marina Solodkin, who chairs the Committee on the
Status of Women, said the comments showed that the air force has
not changed its attitude toward women despite some reforms.
	   Last year, Israel's Supreme Court ordered the air force to
change its policy of training only men as pilots and to admit women
to the course. Later this week, one of the new recruits is to
complete a combat navigation course, the first woman to reach such
an advanced stage of training.
	   The latest controversy began Monday when Brig. Gen. Gil Regev
told Solodkin's committee that women don't have the stamina to be
pilots and that the job interferes with child-rearing.
	   ``I'm concerned about the survival rate of the female
soldiers,'' Solodkin quoted Regev as saying. ``I also think it's
not natural for there to be female pilots.''
	   The army spokesman's office had no immediate comment when asked
whether Regev expressed his personal views or official thinking.
Regev is responsible for placing recruits in air force units.
	   Solodkin said the air force apparently was reluctant to change.
	   ``They show unwillingness to accept the women as equals to
men,'' Solodkin said. ``This is unprofessional because they don't
even see the advances of women in other countries in this field.''
	   In Israel, women are drafted for nearly two years while men do
three years of compulsory service. However, women mostly serve in
clerical jobs and rarely hold command positions.
	   In a landmark ruling in 1995, the Supreme Court overturned an
army policy that barred women in combat. Two years ago, the court
ordered the air force to accept women in its courses and the first
women were accepted last year.

Chinese official says hijacked ship not from Japan
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Chinese officials were investigating a hijacked
ship found in an east China port but denied reports it was a
missing Japanese cargo vessel.
	   An official at Zhanjiagang port in Jiangsu, near Shanghai, on
Tuesday declined to provide further details about the investigation
or the ship, saying such matters were confidential.
	   The owner of the 2,600-ton Tenyu, Masumoto Kisen, said Monday
that the ship, traveling under a new name and with forged papers,
had been found in the Chinese port.
	   Company official Takeshi Masumoto said the ship found in China
was found to have the same production number as that of the Tenyu,
which disappeared in the Straits of Malacca after leaving an
Indonesian port on Sept. 27 with a cargo of aluminum.
	   The Chinese official also disputed reports that the ship was
carrying a crew of 16 Indonesians.
	   South Korean maritime police said Tuesday the Tenyu had been
piloted by a South Korean skipper, Shin Young-ju, and chief
engineer, Park Ha-joon, and was manned by a crew of 12 Chinese
sailors.
	   The whereabouts of the original crew and captain were unknown,
they said.
	   In April, Chinese authorities discovered another hijacked
vessel, the Malaysian-registered Petro Ranger, on China's Hainan
Island, and detained 12 Indonesians.
	   The circumstances of that hijacking also raised controversy,
with Chinese authorities saying the ship actually was involved in
smuggling while the Malaysian government contended the vessel had
been hijacked by Indonesians.
	   Vessels traveling through the Straits of Malacca have in recent
years fallen prey to pirates.

Russian police look into Central Bank activities
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russian police are probing the activities of the
Central Bank because of suspicions that up to dlrs 1 billion may
have been misappropriated, the government said Tuesday.
	   The probe spans Central Bank activities since 1992 when Russia
launched market reforms, Interior Minister Sergei Stepashin told a
news conference. He would not give any names or provide additional
details.
	   Sergei Tesis, the ministry's chief investigator overseeing the
probe, indicated that misappropriation of public funds might have
contributed to Russia's economic crisis _ the worst since the 1991
Soviet collapse.
	   Discussing other matters, Stepashin said there were 2.5 million
crimes in Russia this year. In 1997, the Interior Ministry
registered some 2.4 million crimes.
	   Russian police have tended to under report crime to give a
better picture of the law-and-order situation _ a practice
President Boris Yeltsin strongly condemned last week at a meeting
with Stepashin. Stepashin promised to report a realistic figure.
	   Independent analysts say the government reports just a fraction
of the number of crimes committed in Russia.
	   Stepashin said his ministry solved 250,000 economic crimes such
as embezzlement. Some 6,000 officials were caught taking bribes, he
said.

Asian markets mixed in thin trading
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Asia's two biggest stock markets were higher
Tuesday, while smaller ones were mixed in thin holiday season
trading.
	   In Tokyo, share prices rose despite continued concerns over the
domestic political and economic situation.
	   The U.S. dollar fell against the Japanese yen as investors took
profits amid concerns over the Gulf crisis and the domestic U.S.
economy.
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average gained 137.84
points, or 1.01 percent, to close at 13,846.90.
	   The dollar bought 115.42 yen at midafternoon, down 0.70 yen from
late Monday in Tokyo and also below its late New York level of
115.90 yen overnight.
	   Many Japanese institutional investors were also concerned that
America's long economic boom may be running out of steam.
	   ``The number of dollar bears who see the U.S. economy slowing
down next year is increasing among Japanese institutional investors
and interbank players,'' said Shuji Takano of ABN AMRO Bank in
Tokyo.
	   Despite thin trading, the Tokyo stock market was boosted in a
late surge on futures-led buying.
	   Most investors waited for new developments in a proposed
coalition deal between Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi's Liberal
Democratic Party and the opposition Liberal Party.
	   The two sides were expected to seal a pact this week that would
boost the LDP's leverage in parliament, but last-minute
disagreements stalled negotiations.
	   In Hong Kong, stocks ended slightly higher with the blue-chip
Hang Seng Index rising 55.83 points, or 0.5 percent, to close at
10,225.97.
	   Volume was thin, with some fund managers switching to other
markets in preparation for the inauguration of the single European
currency _ the euro _ on Monday, said Felix Ngai of Sun Hung Kai
Commodities Ltd.
	   ELSEWHERE:
	   BANGKOK: Shares fell amid retail selling in financial stocks.
The SET index fell 8.48 points, or 2.3 percent, to 351.81.
	   JAKARTA: Shares fell with no new leads to reverse the selling
pressure. The JSX Composite Index was down 3.443 points, or 0.90
percent, to close at 396.733.
	   KUALA LUMPUR: Shares rose as retail investors and local
institutions kept buying. The Composite Index was up 10.09 points,
or 1.8 percent, to close at 566.23.
	   MANILA: Shares rose in late buying, particularly in blue-chip
stocks. The PSE index soared 35.84 points, or 1.9 percent, to
1,968.78.
	   TAIPEI: Shares fell to a near four-month low on worries over the
country's poor economic fundamentals. The Weighted Price Index was
down 3.38 points, or 0.05 percent, to 6,478.27.
	   SINGAPORE: Shares dipped slightly in narrow trading. The STI was
down 2.82 points, or 0.20 percent, to close at 1,378.45.
	   SYDNEY: Shares rose with many participants still away for the
holidays. The All Ordinaries index was up 4.4 points, or 0.2
percent, to close at 2,768.4.
	   WELLINGTON: Shares fell as investors cashed in on market gains.
The NZSE-40 index was down 13.07 points, or 0.6 percent, to close

Makah learn patience along with whale hunting skills
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photo XNB801 &QL; 
 &UR; By PEGGY ANDERSEN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEAH BAY, Washington (AP) _ The Makah Indian tribe has waited
more than 70 years to return to the Pacific to hunt gray whales.
For some, the last three months have been among the longest.
	   No one here has ever hunted the whale. There is much to learn,
and time has taken away the teachers. One lesson is clear already:
Some things cannot be rushed.
	   Dozens of reporters stampeded here in late September, responding
to a report that the tribe's first whale hunt in decades was under
way. The hunts had stopped in the 1920s, when commercial whalers
brought the world whale population to the brink of extinction.
	   But since Oct. 1, when the tribe was officially cleared to hunt,
the Makah have yet to venture into the Pacific to search for a
whale. Foul weather, inexperience, mechanical problems,
disagreements over procedures _ all manner of obstacles have
conspired to keep harpoon away from target.
	   Most of the reporters are gone, along with protesters and their
ships. The Makah, meanwhile, are still trying to recreate a store
of lost knowledge.
	   Some Makah elders remember tasting whale meat as children. Some
of the women were taught how to prepare the meat, how to render the
oil. Some of the men know how to fashion whaling canoes from tall
red cedar.
	   But so much time has passed, there is no one still alive who
knows how to whale. And hunting the whale _ especially in small
boats, especially in winter seas, especially gray whales _ is
dangerous.
	   But if any people have whaling in their genes, it is the Makah.
	   They are the ones who could ``find the way to resurrect it,''
said Ed Claplanhoo, a member of the Makah Whaling Commission and
former tribal chairman.
	   Whaling remains a vital part of tribal tradition. The story is
still told of how the thunderbird brought the whale to the Makah
one hungry year long ago. The image of the whale _ in the Makah
colors of black and red _ decorate the school, local homes,
costumes and baskets. Huge weathered whale skulls and bones adorn
front yards in this community of 2,000 _ 1,400 of them among the
tribe's 2,300 enrolled members.
	   The pending hunt goes against tradition: a communal, tribal
hunt, pooling the available knowledge.
	   ``A commission hunt,'' some say without enthusiasm.
	   Traditionally, whaling families mounted their own hunts, with
their own secret preparations and sacred songs. Some aspects of
this pooling business have not gone well, but lessons are learned,
ruffled feelings smoothed _ the process continues.
	   At this point, there is a pool of 17 men to fill out the
eight-man whaling crew. They've been chosen from the 23 families
with a representative on the tribe's whaling commission.
	   There is one canoe _ the 32-foot (10-meter) red-and-black
Hummingbird _ and two motorized support boats. Another canoe is
being built _ a longer, broader craft in the whaling tradition, its
silky golden surface glimmering in the shadows.
	   When the hunt takes place, the plan is to follow a ceremonial
harpoon strike from the canoe with high-powered rifle fire from the
support boats, trying for a quick, humane kill.
	   ``We need to get out there,'' says Wayne Johnson, the whaling
captain chosen earlier this month. ``We need to get it done.''
	   That would mean facing the open sea and the gray whale, a
usually placid marine mammal up to 45 feet (13.5 meters) long.
	   The southbound migration by 23,000 whales is late this year.
Scientists believe warmer temperatures could be a factor.
	   The delay means the grays will come during the winter storm
season, a dangerous time that can bring weeks of 25-foot
(7,5-meter) swells and howling winds. The crew has most of the
equipment it needs, including radios and wetsuits.
	   Claplanhoo believes the whaling crew should wait until the new
canoe is ready, a date that has been postponed several times. Some
now say January, some April.
	   The tribe is allotted a maximum of five whales a year _ 20
through 2002 _ and some say that is designed to provide one whale
to each of the old villages.
	   But at this point, all attention is on the first whale.
	   ``I only need one,'' says Claplanhoo, who wonders if anyone has
need for more in these modern times.
	   Meat can be had at Washburn's General Store, but most Makah
supplement their diets with foods harvested from their rich land
and sea _ deer, elk, grouse, berries, roots, salmon, halibut, seal
and shellfish.
	   For centuries, whale was a central part of the Makah diet, as
whaling was a central part of Makah life and culture.
	   Some of those who remember it miss it. Some who don't remember
it would like to know what they are missing. Many believe a return
to traditional foods would restore health to a community where
diabetes and other problems are linked to the modern American diet.
	   After the first hunt, ``then we'll see,'' said Marcy Parker,
Makah tribal council vice chairman.

<TEXT>
	   MERIMBULA, Australia (AP) _ The skipper of sunk Sydney-Hobart
yacht Winston Churchill vowed Tuesday never to race again after the
deaths of his close friends.
	   ``I personally won't (race); my decision's pretty well made up
in that direction,'' the boat's owner and skipper Richard Winning
said.
	   The 56-year-old Winston Churchill, an entrant in the inaugural
1945 Sydney-Hobart classic, was abandoned on Sunday night and the
nine crew climbed into two life rafts.
	   Winning and three crewmates Paul Lumtin, Bruce Gould and Michael
Rynan on Monday night were winched to safety after 24 hours in a
life raft in huge Bass Strait seas.
	   On Tuesday they were told that two of their fellow yachtsmen Jim
Lawler and Mike Bannister were dead and another, John Dean, is
presumed drowned.
	   Winning said he had no doubt after their life raft was spotted
on Monday night by rescuers that all in the second craft would
survive.
	   ``When I went to bed I thought these blokes would be here
tonight, if not tomorrow morning,'' he said. ``Two of them have
been my mates since I was a young fella.
	   ``That's Michael Bannister and John Dean. I've been sailing with
those guys since I was a young child. It's shocking to lose your
mates like this.''
	   The wooden-hulled Winston Churchill, built in 1942 and competing
in the Sydney-Hobart race for the 16th time, was restored by
Winning about two years ago.
	   Lawler, a 58-year-old grandfather and ocean racing veteran, was
familiar with extreme and sometimes treacherous conditions in the
Sydney-to-Hobart race. having sailed it 17 rtimes by his family's
count.
	   In the 1993 race, when giant seas battered the fleet off the NSW
south coast, Mr Lawler took shelter until the storm eased then
sailed on in his own yacht, Charisma.
	   ``He took his boat to Eden to shelter from the storm and stayed
there for a couple of hours and then won a place in his division,''
said Robert Brenac, a former sailing secretary with the Cruising
Yacht Club of Australia, today.
	   Lawler's family issued a statement paying tribute to those
involved in the search and rescue epic.
	   ``Our prayers and thoughts go out to those who have lost loved
ones, and we thank the many people who have offered support to us
at this difficult time,'' the statement said. ``Jim Lawler was
truly a man of the sea.''

Anarchists in Italy kidnap baby Jesus from nativity scene,
</HEADLINE>
demanding comrade's freedom &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TURIN, Italy (AP) _ Anarchists kidnapped the baby Jesus from a
nativity scene set up by the northern city of Turin, demanding that
authorities free a jailed comrade, Italian newspapers reported
Tuesday.
	   ``Free Silvano now or Jesus is dead!'' an anonymous note sent to
La Repubblica newspaper and Italy's ANSA news service said.
	   A photo sent with the letter showed the statue clutching the
front pages of two Sunday newspapers in its wooden hands.
	   That's a common device in ransom photos, meant to show the dates
the pictures of the captive were taken.
	   The letter was demanding the release of Silvano Pelissero, who
was arrested last spring after an alleged attempt to sabotage a
high-speed train. Two colleagues arrested with Pelissero committed
suicide.
	   The statue was stolen Sunday. Nativity scenes in Italy commonly
stay up until Jan. 6, Epiphany.
	   The man who created the scene urged that the anarchists' demand
be ignored.
	   ``Sure, they've taken a symbol, but we're only talking about a
piece of wood,'' artist Emanuele Luzzati told Corriere della Sera
newspaper.

Ellison arrives first in tragic race
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES 8th graf with 4 confirmed dead, 2 presumed drowned &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   HOBART, Australia (AP) _ United States billionaire Larry
Ellison, teary-eyed after battling through deadly waves in the
Sydney-to-Hobart yacht race Tuesday, said he said he had never
experienced worse conditions at sea.
	   Ellison, the founder and chief executive of computer giant
Oracle, won his second Sydney-to-Hobart race but arrived in Hobart
early Tuesday to a funereal atmosphere.
	   Asked if he'd come back again, Ellison said, ``My first reaction
is not if I live to a thousand years. But who knows?''
	   ``It was just awful, I've never experienced anything remotely
like this,'' Ellison said. ``It's been a very emotional experience
to get here. This is not what this is supposed to be about. A lot
of us are upset.''
	   Ellison said it was an extraordinarily difficult journey as his
yacht battled ``right through the eye of a hurricane'' and his crew
heard by radio of the deaths in the battered fleet.
	   Sayonara finished the race in two days, 20 hours, three minutes
and 32 seconds, but missing the record time was irrelevant to the
shaken crew, which included media magnate Rupert Murdoch's son
Lachlan.
	   ``Guys were knocked down time and time again, but kept getting
up to do what had to be done to keep us alive,'' Ellison said.
``It's a tough crew, but the guys were choked up. We were learning
of people dying.''
	   As many as six sailors are believed to have perished, with four
bodies found and two presumed drowned, in the worst tragedy to hit
the race in its 54-year history.
	   Sayonara crossed the finishing line to a subdued welcome by a
smaller-than-usual spectator fleet and dockside crowd. The 23-man
crew aboard the maxi were safe, except for one who had a broken
ankle.
	   A welcome celebration was postponed and the trophy presentation
was delayed until January 2.
	   ``That's as tough as it gets,'' said Sayonara's helmsman Chris
Dickson. ``Being here first is nice but being here at all is a big
thing and we're thinking about those who are still out there, not
thinking too much about how we've done.''
	   New Zealander Dickson, who said he has experienced similar
conditions in the Whitbread Around the World race, was unsure if he
would attempt this event again.
	   ``Anyone who is not scared in those conditions is not human,''
Dickson said. ``For a long time in Bass Strait we were not racing.
Nor was anyone else.''
	   Murdoch, chief executive of family-owned Australian newspaper
business News Limited, said the race was a great tragedy which the
crew was still trying to absorb.
	   ``Everyone here is very saddened and it gives you mixed feelings
about being part of it all,'' Murdoch said.

Businessman brutally killed in Ukraine
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ A wealthy regional official was brutally
gunned down in western Ukraine in an apparent organized crime
contract killing, officials said Tuesday.
	   Two unidentified killers with automatic guns fired dozens of
bullets at Mykhailo Tokar, member of a regional council, as he
parked his car near his home in the city of Mukachevo late Friday.
	   Tokar, 37, died almost immediately of multiple wounds and the
killers escaped after discarding their weapons on a nearby street,
Vasyl Bonkalo, a police spokesman in Mukachevo told The Associated
Press. The killings bore all the hallmarks of a contract killing.
	   Several newspapers said Tuesday the murder might have been
organized by one of the region's criminal gangs and linked to
Tokar's alleged involvement in smuggling operations.
	   Tokar allegedly controlled the smuggling of cars and alcohol
from neighboring eastern European states and exports to these
countries of cheap labor, the daily Segodnya said.
	   Ukraine's Zakarpattia region, which borders Hungary, Slovakia
and Romania, is a major route for smuggling goods to Ukraine.

<TEXT>
	   MERIMBULA, Australia (AP) _ Navy pilot Tanzi Lea peered down
into mountainous seas and was carried back 20 years to the 1979
Fastnet race where 15 sailors perished.
	   Lea was the pilot of a navy Sea King helicopter which hauled two
dead sailors, Jim Lawler and Michael Bannister, out of Bass Strait
Tuesday. Four bodies have been found and two sailors are presumed
drowned from the deadliest Sydney-to-Hobart race in history.
	   He was a member of Britain's Royal Navy during the Fastnet
rescue off the south west coast of Ireland where only 85 yachts
finished out of 303 starters because of high winds and punishing
waves.
	   ``The seas were as big as I saw during rescues in the Fastnet
race 20 years ago,'' Lea told The Associated Press after arriving
back with the two bodies Tuesday. ``Under those circumstances
you've got to be careful and act prudently.''
	   Lea, now with the Australian navy, was involved throughout this
search and rescue process. He said the weather was at its worst
Monday and Sunday but had calmed considerably by the time his
helicopter reached the bodies Tuesday.
	   ``A big depression formed quickly and although a change was
expected I don't think people thought it would be this bad,'' Lea
said.
	   Lawler and Bannister were believed to be from the veteran cutter
Winston Churchill. Another crew member, John Dean, is presumed
drowned, while six others were carried to safety.
	   Two of the men saved were in a life raft which had its bottom
torn away by heavy seas. A wave knocked their three mates out of
reach.
	   Shane Pashley, a navy diver, reached the two crew members who
had managed to hang onto the remnants of their life raft.
	   ``We winched the first guy up who was absolutely exhausted, the
waves were crashing over the top of the raft which made it very
difficult as I was continually dragged under the water,'' Pashley
told AP. ``Once we'd winched him up we put him on the floor of the
aircraft and turned the heaters up because he was suffering from
exposure.''
	   The harness was sent down for the second survivor but it snagged
on the life raft. He was eventually hauled aboard the helicopter.
	   ``One bloke said he knew where the other guys were but we
couldn't do anything as we were nearly out of fuel,'' Pashley said.
``They were just really tired and very thirsty, one of the guys was
only wearing a spray jacket and shorts.''
	   Pashley, like most Australians, has vivid memories of the rescue
of English yachtie Tony Bullimore, who showed unrestrained joy
after being found following four days alone at sea in early 1997.
	   But there was no great sense of celebration for Pashley.
	   ``There were no Tony Bullimore-style kisses,'' he said. ``They
were just done.''

Yeltsin vows that Russia will continue reforms

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ President Boris Yeltsin pledged Tuesday that the
government won't backtrack on democratic and market reforms even
though Russia is mired in the worst economic crisis since the end
of the Soviet era.
	   ``There is no other path for Russia than toward democracy,''
Yeltsin said in a letter published in the business daily
Kommersant.
	   Yeltsin has said little and done even less to address the
economic crisis, leaving day-to-day management of the economy to
Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov.
	   Primakov has said that Russia should continue the market
reforms, but put an end to ``wild'' capitalism by strengthening
state regulation of the economy.
	   Critics say that the government, struggling to pay off domestic
and foreign debts, is likely to print a huge amount of new cash,
leading to the kind of high inflation that has plagued Russia in
the past.
	   Many fear that hyperinflation would push Russia toward
Soviet-style price and currency controls and rationing.
	   Yeltsin said he would not allow that.
	   ``The outgoing year 1998 wasn't the easiest for any of us, and
many people might think that the nation has reversed on its path,''
Yeltsin said. ``That isn't true. As the president of Russia, I say
that there is no way back.''
	   Since a new Cabinet was appointed in September, Primakov and
other officials have been vague about their plans to deal with the
crisis, speaking in general terms about the need for more state
controls and increased state support for domestic industries.
	   The Cabinet has given itself until April to work out a
medium-term economic plan, the ITAR-Tass news agency reported on
Tuesday.
	   Most experts have criticized next year's budget, which won a
quick initial approval by the parliament this month, as unrealistic
and dependent on foreign loans that may not materialize.
	   The International Monetary Fund and other lenders have urged
Russia to pass a realistic budget as a key condition for releasing
aid.
	   The former first deputy chief of Russia's Central Bank, Sergei
Alexashenko, dismissed government projections of an average ruble
rate of 21.5 to the U.S. dollar next year as unfeasible. He said
the ruble is likely to fall to below 40 to the dollar by the end of
next year.
	   He predicted a government plan to cut taxes would lead to a
severe shortfall in revenue, scare away the IMF and leave Russia
with no other choice but to print money to pay its debts.
	   Next year's inflation, projected at 30 percent by the
government, is likely to hover between 100 percent and 300 percent,
Alexashenko said in an interview published by the daily Kommersant
on Tuesday.

Four charged in Nigeria pipeline fire
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ABUJA, Nigeria (AP) _ Nigerian authorities have charged four
suspects with causing a massive explosion and deadly fire that
killed at least 700 people, according to court records released
Tuesday.
	   The four suspects are accused of tampering with an oil pipeline,
triggering a leak that subsequently fueled the blast and inferno.
	   The pipeline erupted into flames in October, killing hundreds of
people who had gathered around the area to try to collect spilling
fuel.
	   The suspects appeared briefly in court on Monday in the
southeastern town of Warri in the oil-rich Niger River delta
region.
	   After their arraignment, the case was adjourned until Jan. 11,
when the suspects are expected to enter a plea. They will be held
in prison until their next court appearance, the court said.
	   Police officers in the town of Jesse, where the explosion
occurred, are still investigating the case and officials believe
additional suspects may be charged.
	   Pipeline sabotage is not uncommon in Niger's delta region, where
villagers often live in subsistence poverty. Shell Oil, the largest
foreign oil firm operating in Nigeria, says the majority of minor
oil pipeline spills here are caused by sabotage.
	   Jesse community leaders, however, say the blast was not the
cause of sabotage, but instead resulted from neglect for the
pipeline facility.
	   Nigeria suffers hundreds of offshore and underground pipeline
spills every year.

United Nations mission in Angola says its crashed plane is intact
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By BARRY HATTON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ The United Nations mission in Angola has
``clear indications'' that a U.N.-chartered cargo plane which
crashed near a war zone is mostly intact, a spokesman said Tuesday.
	   U.N. spokesman Hamadoun Toure said the C-130 transport plane
which crashed Saturday with 14 people on board had not
disintegrated when it hit the ground.
	   However, there was only a ``very, very minor chance'' of
survivors being found, Toure said in a telephone interview from the
Angolan capital, Luanda.
	   Toure declined to reveal the source of the information.
	   The U.N. said Monday it had picked up an SOS morse code signal
from the aircraft. However, communications specialists cannot tell
whether the signals _ identified as coming from the plane _ are
being sent manually or are automatic transmissions.
	   Toure said the U.N. observer mission, in Angola to oversee
implementation of the former Portuguese colony's 1994 peace deal,
was still waiting for the government and the UNITA rebel group to
guarantee safe passage for a rescue team.
	   ``We've spoken to everyone we can on both sides, but we're still
waiting for a green light,'' Toure said.
	   Both sides have said they will only stop fighting after the
other one has stopped, according to Toure.
	   He said a U.N. rescue team would need at least 24 hours to
conduct a proper search and rescue operation.
	   The C-130 aircraft crashed Saturday 10 minutes after takeoff in
the bush near the central highland city of Huambo, about 500
kilometers (310 miles) southeast of Luanda.
	   The 10 passengers on board included three Angolans, two
Russians, an Australian, an Egyptian, a Cameroonian, a Zambian and
a Namibian. The crew was made up of a South African, an Angolan, a
Bolivian and a Filipino.
	   Eight of the passengers were members of the U.N. mission. Two
others were employed by a private communications company, Dinacom,
which works with the U.N.
	   The plane, owned by TransAfric, was painted with the U.N.
colors, and both the government army and rebels were informed of
the flight's schedule before the aircraft took off from Huambo.
	   The army and UNITA _ a Portuguese acronym for the National Union
for the Total Independence of Angola _ have reported fierce clashes
between their forces in the central highlands where new fighting
broke out Dec. 4.
	   The U.N. Security Council has expressed dismay at Angola's
apparent slide back to civil war. The country has been ravaged by
conflict since gaining independence from Portugal in 1975.

Waugh seeks legal advice on bribery inquiry
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) _ Australian cricketer Mark Waugh is
seeking independent legal advice before agreeing to appear before a
Pakistan judicial inquiry into match fixing.
	   While Waugh is seeking advice from lawyers outside the
Australian Cricket Board, leg-spinner Shane Warne and former team
manager Alan Crompton are happy to give their evidence to the
inquiry in public.
	   Waugh, Warne and Crompton will testify before the Pakistan
commission in Melbourne on Jan. 8.
	   The players were requested to provide evidence to the inquiry
after admitting taking money from an illegal Indian bookmaker for
providing information on weather and pitch conditions during
Australia's tour of Sri Lanka in 1994.
	   The bookmaker scandal involving the players has been placed on
an International Cricket Council meeting agenda for Jan. 10-11 and
a bloc of subcontinent countries _ India, Pakistan and Sri Lanka _
will lobby the ICC to slap life bans on the Australians.
	   The pair were fined by the ACB in Feb. 1995 but the action was
kept secret until three weeks ago. The ACB believes no further
action should be taken against Waugh and Warne.
	   The commission accepted an offer from Crompton, who was
Australian team manager at the time, to testify.
	   ACB lawyers Brian Ward and Co. have sent a five-page letter to
the Pakistan commission which is investigating allegations of match
fixing and bribery.
	   Waugh gave evidence to the hearing in Lahore in October during
Australia's tour of Pakistan but did not divulge his link with the
Indian bookmaker.
	   He has alleged former Pakistan captain Salim Malik offered a
bribe to throw a game during Australia's tour there in 1994.
	   Warne and former Test spinner Tim May have made similar
allegations against Malik.
	   ACB communications manager Michael Hogan said Tuesday the board
was waiting on Pakistan to reply to the five-page letter from Brian
Ward and Co.
	   In the letter, the legal firm details its instructions from ACB
chief executive Malcolm Speed.
	   ``We are further instructed by Mr Speed that both Mr Crompton
and Mr Warne are content for their evidence to be given in
public,'' the letter says.
	   ``With respect to Mr Mark Waugh, our instructions are that he is
presently obtaining independent legal advice in relation to his
availability to give evidence and whether he will seek to give
evidence in camera.''
	   Two days after Waugh, Warne and Crompton are scheduled to give
evidence to the Pakistan commission, the ICC will tackle the issue
of gambling in the sport at a meeting in Christchurch, New Zealand.

Hindu nationalists distance themselves from anti-missionary

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ The governing Hindu nationalist party is
distancing itself from an anti-missionary campaign by Hindu
extremists that erupted in violence recently in western India.
However, the government said it will ensure tough action to protect
the small Christian community.
	   A Bharatiya Janata Party spokesman, K.L. Sharma, was quoted in
Indian newspapers Tuesday as condemning the recent attacks on
churches in the western state of Gujarat, although he declined to
blame any specific group. The attacks began Dec. 25.
	   In the latest incidents, Hindu radicals burned down a church
Monday and stormed three others with axes, iron rods, and hammers,
sending Christian missionaries fleeing for safety, police and
witnesses said.
	   Members of two right-wing Hindu parties blamed for most of the
violence are angered by the missionaries' efforts to convert poor,
often illiterate tribal people. They say the missionaries use the
promise of jobs to get people to convert.
	   B.P. Singh, the senior official of the Home Ministry,
responsible for law and order, said he instructed the Gujarat
government to deal sternly in any incident against Christians, and
demanded a report on the recent attacks, Press Trust of India
reported.
	   India's pro-Hindu parties have been further embarrassed by a
comment attributed to Ashok Singhal, leader of the World Hindu
Council, contending that the awarding of the Nobel Prize to
Indian-born economist Amartya Sen this year was part of a worldwide
``Christian conspiracy to propagate their religion and wipe out
Hinduism from this country.''
	   The Council, known in India as the Vishwa Hindu Parishad, was
one of two extremist groups blamed for the attacks.
	   In a speech Sunday, Singhal reportedly argued that the Nobel
laureate's assertion that literacy is essential for India's
development justified the network of Christian-sponsored schools
that often have a broad enrollment of pupils from Hindu families.
	   On Tuesday, Singhal issued a statement saying his remarks were
distorted and that he agreed ``all of society should be educated.''
	   But he again criticized what he called an attempt to convert
poor Hindus with financial inducements, and said Christians were
exaggerating the incidents to attract donations from abroad.
	   About 2 percent of India's population of nearly 1 billion people
are Christian. Although few in number, the community exerts greater
influence because its English-language private schools are in high
demand by India's elite.

South Africa on the verge of victory in WIndies cricket Test
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DURBAN, South Africa (AP) _ South Africa was on the brink of
clinching the series against the West Indies, holding at 75 without
loss at lunch on the fourth day of the cricket test at Kingsmead
Tuesday.
	   Earlier, they wrapped up the West Indies innings in just four
overs and three balls.
	   Shaun Pollock moved to his third five-wicket haul of the series
as he dismissed Curtly Ambrose for five. Allan Donald bowled
Courtney Walsh for three.
	   The tourists were all out for 259, putting them just 145 ahead,
with nearly two full days left for play during the third test of
the West Indians tour.
	   South Africa started steadily and gradually increased the pace,
with Gary Kirsten undefeated on 40 and Herschelle Gibbs on 32.
	   Both looked unperturbed by anything the West Indies bowlers had
to offer, although Gibbs played a rash shot three balls before
lunch and was dropped off a skied pull shot by wicketkeeper Ridley
Jacobs off the bowling of Rawl Lewis.
	   If the South Africans are to fear anything, it is the fact that
Lewis is turning the ball prodigiously.
	   But West Indies received another blow when Walsh damaged his
hamstring running to cut off a ball in the field. It appears his
participation in the next Test is in doubt.
	   If South Africa win, they take an unbeatable 3-0 lead in the
five-test series. The next match takes place at Newlands in Cape
Town on January 2.

 &UR; Eds: RECASTS and UPDATES throughout with news conference, Khmer
Rouge leaders say ``sorry.''

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Two top Khmer Rouge leaders came to
Phnom Penh on Tuesday and said they were ``sorry'' for their brutal
rule during the 1970s, asking their countrymen to ``let bygones be
bygones.''
	   Prime Minister Hun Sen met Khieu Samphan and Nuon Chea, part of
the inner circle of the late Pol Pot, with smiles and handshakes
after cementing their defection _ in essence, surrender _ with
public pledges not to try them for genocide.
	   At a hostile news conference later, the elderly revolutionaries
faced questions whether they felt any remorse for causing the
deaths of as many as 2 million of their countrymen. Many of the
Cambodian reporters present had lost close relatives.
	   ``Yes, sorry, very sorry,'' Khieu Samphan said, looking red and
sullen. ``We would like to apologize and ask our compatriots to
forget the past so our nation can concentrate on the future. Let
bygones be bygones.''

In campaign stop, Netanyahu strikes familiar theme: Jerusalem
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who is
fighting an uphill battle to get re-elected, on Tuesday prayed at
the Western Wall, Judaism's holiest site, and struck a theme that
helped him win in 1996 _ a pledge to keep Jerusalem united.
	   Netanyahu's campaign began in earnest after a parliamentary
committee on Tuesday confirmed May 17 as the date for elections,
more than a year ahead of schedule.
	   Netanyahu faces a growing field of challengers, including
members of his own Likud Party who either seek to wrest the party's
nomination from him or plan to run on their own slate.
	   In 1996, he narrowly defeated incumbent Prime Minister Shimon
Peres. The Netanyahu campaign slogan ``Peres will divide
Jerusalem'' was in part credited with giving Netanyahu his victory.
	   At the time, Netanyahu accused Peres of making too many
concessions to the Palestinians who hope to set up a future capital
in east Jerusalem, the sector Israel captured from Jordan in the
1967 Mideast war and later annexed into its capital.
	   On Tuesday, the secular Netanyahu arrived at the Wall, the last
remnant of the Jewish Temple destroyed by the Romans in 70 A.D.,
wearing a black skullcap and holding a prayer book. He caressed the
honey-colored stones and read psalms about Jerusalem.
	   In the Jewish calendar, Tuesday marks the first day of the Roman
siege of ancient Jerusalem and religious Jews observe it by fasting
from dawn to dusk.
	   ``This is an important date in Jewish history,'' Netanyahu said,
adding that since the Roman siege, Jews have been struggling to
regain control over Jerusalem and keep it united.
	   ``This is very much the struggle we are engaged in now, and I
come here to renew my strength and to draw encouragement from
generations of Jews who prayed that we would be here and that we
will stay here,'' Netanyahu said.
	   Netanyahu's trip to the Wall also appeared to be an attempt to
restore his standing among ultra-Orthodox and observant Jews who
voted solidly for him in 1996. The religious group Habad, which
actively campaigned for Netanyahu in the previous election, has
withdrawn its support, saying the prime minister had broken a
secret pledge not to transfer West Bank land to the Palestinians.
	   Some worshippers appeared annoyed rather than pleased by
Netanyahu's pilgrimage, saying the extensive security forced them
to wait for more than an hour on a fast day.
	   ``They checked my phylacteries, everything, and by the time they
were done it was almost too late to pray,'' said Yehiel Ben David,
a seminary student from Jerusalem.
	   One ultra-Orthodox Jew did not let the Netanyahu visit disrupt
his plans. He pressed a mobile phone against the Wall. On the other
end of the line were relatives from France who recited prayers.

Taiwan president meets exiled Chinese dissident

<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ President Lee Teng-hui met exiled Chinese
dissident Wei Jingsheng Tuesday in an unprecedented show of support
for the democracy movement in China and drew immediate criticism
from Beijing.
	   ``President Lee said he and Taiwanese people stand firmly behind
the mainland people and will use any methods possible to help the
mainland become democratic soon,'' Wei told a news conference
afterward. ``He made the point very clear.''
	   Lee did not give details about the promised support, but Wei
said, ``our meeting itself demonstrated cooperation.''
	   Describing Lee as a ``very moderate'' person, Wei said the two
also talked about Taiwan's transition to democracy.
	   Lee has refrained from meeting other exiled Chinese dissidents
to avoid provoking China.
	   The meeting with Wei, coming near the end of the dissident's
10-day visit, followed newspaper calls for a meeting between two
figures they called Taiwan's ``Mr. Democracy'' and China's ``human
rights fighter.''
	   In the one-hour meeting, Lee said Taiwan's profound experience
after decades of political separation from the mainland can provide
China and other Asian countries a model for democracy.
	   ``I don't agree to bloody reforms,'' a government statement
quoted Lee as saying. ``It must proceed step by step. That is also
the reason why people would pursue reforms.''
	   In Beijing, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhu Bangzao
warned Taiwan against exploiting Wei's visit.
	   ``We are opposed to anyone, opposed to any side, using Wei
Jingsheng to achieve their own purpose. You all know what kind of
person Wei Jingsheng is,'' Zhu said.
	   Wei was released from a Chinese prison last year where he spent
much of the last 18 years after his arrest for championing
democracy.
	   Taiwan's Nationalists fled to the island in 1949 after losing a
civil war to China's Communists. China claims sovereignty over
Taiwan and considers it a rebel province to be retaken by force if
necessary.
	   Taiwan's ruling Nationalists say the island's peaceful
transition to democracy over the last decade should be a model for
China, and they say China must have democracy before it can attempt
to reunify with Taiwan.
	   Wei criticized Chinese authorities as suppressing people's
efforts to seek democracy.
	   ``If opposition parties are not allowed, democracy is false,''
he said. ``A peaceful and bloodless transition to democracy is very
important for China.''
	   While praising Taiwan for its democracy, Wei has earlier accused
Taiwanese politicians of not doing enough to help foster democracy
in China.
	   Observers said they hope Wei's visit could foster more
interaction between Chinese and Taiwanese, who have alienated
themselves from Chinese affairs in antagonism over Beijing's
diplomatic isolation of the island.

United Nations mission in Angola says its crashed plane is intact
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By BARRY HATTON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ The United Nations mission in Angola has
``clear indications'' that a U.N.-chartered cargo plane that
crashed three days earlier near a war zone is mostly intact, a U.N.
spokesman said Tuesday.
	   The C-130 transport plane, which crashed Saturday with 14 people
on board, had not disintegrated when it hit the ground, Hamadoun
Toure said . The aircraft crashed 10 minutes after takeoff in the
bush near the central highland city of Huambo, about 500 kilometers
(310 miles) southeast of Luanda.
	   There was only a ``very, very minor chance'' of survivors being
found, Toure said in a telephone interview from the Angolan
capital, Luanda.
	   Toure declined to reveal the source of the information.
	   The United Nations said Monday that it picked up an SOS morse
code signal from the aircraft. However, communications specialists
cannot tell whether the signals _ identified as coming from the
plane _ are being sent manually or are automatic transmissions.
	   Toure said the U.N. observer mission, in Angola to oversee
implementation of the former Portuguese colony's 1994 peace deal,
was still waiting for the government and the UNITA rebel group to
guarantee safe passage for a rescue team.
	   ``We've spoken to everyone we can on both sides, but we're still
waiting for a green light,'' Toure said.
	   Both sides have said they will only stop fighting after the
other has stopped, Toure said.
	   He said a U.N. rescue team would need at least 24 hours to
conduct a proper search and rescue operation.
	   The 10 passengers on board included three Angolans, two
Russians, an Australian, an Egyptian, a Cameroonian, a Zambian and
a Namibian. The crew was made up of a South African, an Angolan, a
Bolivian and a Filipino.
	   Eight passengers were members of the U.N. mission. Two others
were employed by a private communications company, Dinacom, which
works with the United Nations.
	   The plane, owned by TransAfric, was painted with the U.N.
colors. Both the government army and rebels were informed of the
flight's schedule before the aircraft took off from Huambo.
	   The army and UNITA _ a Portuguese acronym for the National Union
for the Total Independence of Angola _ have reported fierce clashes
between their forces in the central highlands where new fighting
broke out Dec. 4.
	   The U.N. Security Council has expressed dismay at Angola's
apparent slide back to civil war. The country has been ravaged by
conflict since gaining independence from Portugal in 1975.

Residential mortgages increase in November
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ New residential mortgages jumped 48 percent in
November from October, officials said Tuesday, indicating the
property market may be headed for recovery amid a series of
interest rate cuts.
	   Hong Kong banks approved mortgages worth 14.7 billion Hong Kong
dollars (U.S. dlrs 1.88 billion), compared with 9.9 billion Hong
Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs 1.27 billion) in October, said a statement
from the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, the territory's de facto
central bank.
	   The actual amount home-buyers borrowed surged 61 percent in
November to 10.3 billion Hong Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs 1.32 billion)
from October's 6.4 billion Hong Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs 821
million).
	   The amount was expected to edge higher in December ``in view of
improved market conditions,'' the monetary authority said.
	   A series of recent interest rate cuts has helped lift the
market, though most economists predict prices will not rebound to
previous levels anytime soon.
	   Property values have plunged by up to 60 percent from their
peaks reached just before Asia's financial crisis started to
spread.
	   Hong Kong's once-robust economy slipped into recession and
unemployment rose to record highs.

NATO ``ready to intervene'' in Kosovo
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ NATO on Tuesday said it was ``ready to
intervene'' in Kosovo if violence intensifies in the breakaway
Serbian province and demanded Yugoslav authorities and armed ethnic
Albanians respect a ceasefire.
	   NATO Secretary General Javier Solana urged the two sides
fighting for control of the province ``not to endanger the fragile
security situation'' and recalled that the ``activation order''
authorizing NATO airstrikes remained in place.
	   ``NATO is ready to intervene if the situation requires,'' said
Solana.
	   The 16-nation alliance issued the airstrike threat in October to
persuade the Serbs to stop their crackdown against the ethnic
Albanian rebels. The attacks were put on hold after Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic agreed on a truce and pulled out some
of his forces.
	   Fighting flared again last week, leaving at least 15 people dead
and forcing thousands of civilians to flee into snow-covered hills.
	   Solana said he was in permanent contact with NATO's military
commanders and the unarmed international monitors in Kosovo who
negotiated a ceasefire Sunday to halt the latest fighting.

Jordanian pharmacists' group plans to defy sanctions on Iraq
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JOHN HALABY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ The apex body of Jordan's pharmacists said
Tuesday it intends to ship drugs and medical equipment to Iraq in
defiance of U.N. sanctions.
	   The Jordanian Pharmacists Association, whose members own 1,600
pharmacies and 12 drug factories, will on Monday dispatch trucks to
Iraq carrying ``large shipments,'' the group's chairman, Dr. Abdul
Rahim Issa, said.
	   Issa, however, acknowledged that Jordanian authorities may
prevent the trucks from crossing the border into Iraq. If that
happens, the trucks ``will turn back,'' he said.
	   Jordanian government officials were not immediately available
for comment.
	   U.N. sanctions imposed on Iraq after its 1990 invasion of Kuwait
ban it from importing or exporting most goods. Humanitarian items
such as food and medicine are allowed, but every sale has to be
approved by a U.N. sanctions committee. The committee's job is to
ensure that the seemingly harmless exports to Iraq cannot be used
in its weapons industries.
	   Issa said the association has decided to sell its drugs in Iraq,
at low prices, without ``obtaining approval from the U.N. Sanctions
Committee.''
	   He said the association has asked all drug stores, factories,
and medical equipment shops in Jordan to contribute for the
shipments.
	   ``We have taken this action to support and back the Iraqi
people, who have suffered the unjust embargo for eight years,'' he
said.
	   Issa called upon other business associations in Jordan and other
Arab countries to defy the embargo.
	   Last Monday, the association began a boycott of American and
British drugs and medical equipment to protest against U.S.-British
airstrikes on Iraq from Dec. 16 to Dec. 19.
	   Meanwhile, Egyptian newspapers reported Tuesday that the
Egyptian Pharmacists Syndicate has decided to boycott some 74
widely used American and British medicines, and instructed its
members to sell locally made alternatives.
	   The syndicate said it is considering widening the boycott to
include more drugs.
	   The airstrikes on Iraq followed a complaint by U.N. weapons
inspectors that Iraq is hindering their mission to dismantle the
country's weapons of mass destruction.
	   Until the U.N. inspectors certify that Iraq is free of nuclear,
chemical and biological weapons and long-range missiles, the United
Nations cannot lift the trade sanctions.

	   Neither accepted personal responsibility. As the half-hour news
conference at a hotel broke up, they were mobbed and demands
shouted at them to personally apologize to the families of those
who perished.
	   Khieu Samphan indicated there would be no trial, especially one
overseas by an international tribunal. The United Nations recently
sent a team of experts to weigh the possibility of such a court.
	   ``Please let the Cambodian people resolve this problem,'' Khieu
Samphan said.
	   ``As you know, Hun Sen, prime minister of the royal government,
has warmly welcomed us,'' Khieu Samphan said. ``If we have to say
who was wrong and who was right, etc., etc., we cannot have
national reconciliation. We cannot put an end to the war.''
	   Nuon Chea, asked who was to blame for the massacre of Cambodians
under Khmer Rouge rule, echoed: ``Let's consider that an old issue.
I cannot clarify that.''
	   ``We are very sorry, not just for the human lives, but also
animal lives that were lost in the war,'' Nuon Chea said.

	   A summary of financial and business news from The Associated
Press at 1200 GMT. Stories carry ``f'' or ``i'' category codes and
move on this circuit in expanded form:
	   HONG KONG _ Asia's two biggest stock markets were higher
Tuesday, while smaller ones were mixed in thin holiday season
trading. In Tokyo, share prices rose despite continued concerns
over the domestic political and economic situation. The U.S. dollar
fell against the Japanese yen as investors took profits amid
concerns over the Gulf crisis and the domestic U.S. economy. The
benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average gained 137.84 points, or
1.01 percent, to close at 13,846.90. The dollar bought 115.42 yen
at midafternoon, down 0.70 yen from late Monday in Tokyo and also
below its late New York level of 115.90 yen overnight. Many
Japanese institutional investors were also concerned that America's
long economic boom may be running out of steam. (ASIAN-MARKETS)
	   BEIJING _ After years of debate and bureaucratic infighting, the
top committee of China's legislature approved Tuesday a national
law to police the country's freewheeling securities markets. The
Standing Committee of the National People's Congress adopted the
law on the last day of a six-day session. The law will take effect
July 1, 1999, the state-run Xinhua News Agency reported. It said
the 12-chapter, 214-article law governs all aspects of the
securities industry, from the issue and trading of stocks to
purchases of listed companies, registration and accounts settlement
agencies, government regulatory bodies and penalties for violating
the law. The new law retains a prohibition already in force against
foreign investors buying shares in China's A-share market, Xinhua
said. Foreign investors remain limited to the smaller, less active
B-share market. (CHINA-SECURITIES LAW)
	   TOKYO (AP) _ A failed Japanese lender is suspected of violating
the law by offering stock dividends this year despite being warned
by the central bank it was in deep financial trouble, a news report
said Tuesday. The Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan Ltd., which was
recently nationalized after being declared insolvent, announced it
would extend 7 billion yen (dlrs 60 million) in dividends at a
shareholders meeting in June, the Yomiuri newspaper reported. The
payments came shortly after the Bank of Japan had informed LTCB
that 70 percent of its 2.79 trillion yen (dlrs 24 billion) in loans
to affiliates had gone sour, placing the bank in danger of
collapsing, said the Yomiuri, Japan's largest daily. (JAPAN-ILLEGAL
DIVIDENDS)
	   BERLIN (AP) _ The introduction of a single currency could create
jobs by stimulating sharper competition among European regions,
German central bank president Hans Tietmeyer said Tuesday. If the
11 states adopting the euro Jan. 1 live up to the new competition,
it could very well lead to additional investment, more dynamism _
and more jobs, he said in an interview in DeutschlandRadio Berlin.
Tietmeyer also noted that with the advent of the euro, national
problems, such as unemployment, will no longer be able to be solved
through exchange rates. He stressed the need for greater political
cooperation among the 11 euro nations. (GERMANY-EURO-TIETMEYER)
	   TOKYO (AP) _ U.S. financial services company American Express
Co. plans to establish a securities company in Japan next year, a
company spokesman said Tuesday. The company has applied to the
Finance Ministry for permission to set up the venture under new
rules that make it easier to launch a brokerage in Japan, said
company spokemsan Mitsuo Inagaki. American Express hopes to sell
investment funds to individual investors, but the company has not
yet decided on its range of products, Inagaki said. The move comes
as many foreign financial institutions launch or expand operations
in Japan to take advantage of the country's ``Big Bang'' financial
deregulation reforms. (ASIAN BUSINESS BRIEFS)

	   A summary of news from The Associated Press. Some items have
moved on this circuit in expanded form with ``i'' or ``f'' category
codes:
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq _ Iraq's official media lashed out Tuesday at Arab
leaders for not supporting Saddam Hussein's government, and his
deputy prime minister criticized the Egyptian president for saying
that Iraq provoked the recent U.S.-British airstrikes. Arab leaders
must either support Iraq or risk the ``wrath'' of the Arab masses,
Iraqi newspapers said, referring to the Arab League's failure to
convene a proposed meeting of Arab foreign ministers to discuss and
condemn the Dec. 16-19 airstrikes. The attacks prompted widespread
public protests in Arab capitals. (IRAQ)
	   SYDNEY, Australia _ Authorities recovered the bodies of four
sailors and gave up hope Tuesday of finding two others after a
monstrous storm decimated the Sydney-to-Hobart yacht race, its
90-mph (145-kph) winds and 35-foot (10.5-meter) swells snapping
masts and flipping boats over. A former British Olympic sailor and
an Australian competitor were missing and presumed drowned, the
Australian Maritime Safety Authority said. The bodies of four
sailors were found over two days in one of Australia's largest
maritime rescue operations ever. The race continued, however,
finishing Tuesday morning when American Larry Ellison and his maxi
yacht Sayonara arrived in Hobart, Tasmania. southeastern coast, 250
miles (400 kilometers) south of Sydney. (AUSTRALIA-DEADLY YACHT
RACE)
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia _ Two top Khmer Rouge leaders came to Phnom
Penh on Tuesday and said they were ``sorry'' for their brutal rule
during the 1970s, asking their countrymen to ``let bygones be
bygones.'' Prime Minister Hun Sen met Khieu Samphan and Nuon Chea,
part of the inner circle of the late Pol Pot, with smiles and
handshakes after cementing their defection _ in essence, surrender
_ with public pledges not to try them for genocide. At a news
conference later, the elderly revolutionaries faced questions on
whether they felt any remorse for causing the deaths of as many as
2 million of their countrymen. Many of the Cambodian reporters
present had lost close relatives. ``Yes, sorry, very sorry,'' Khieu
Samphan said, looking red and sullen. ``We would like to apologize
and ask our compatriots to forget the past so our nation can
concentrate on the future. Let bygones be bygones.''
(CAMBODIA-KHMER ROUGE)
	   SAN`A, Yemen _ Yemeni officials started negotiations Tuesday
with Islamic extremists for the release of 16 Western tourists as
security forces encircled the area where the militants are said to
be holding the hostages. Gov. Ahmad Ali Mohsen of Abyan province,
where the kidnappings occurred, is talking with leaders of the
Al-Fadl tribe, an official at the governor's office said. Mohsen
was accompanied by Islamic figures who are influential with the
abductors, the official said on condition of anonymity. A security
official said about 200 troops were deployed Tuesday in Abyan. The
hostages include 12 Britons, six of them women, two American women
and two Australian men. (YEMEN-KIDNAPPING)
	   FREETOWN, Sierra Leone (AP) _ Rebel forces battling to oust
President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah have taken control of the central town
of Makeni, defense force officers said Tuesday. Makeni, a strategic
town about 120 kilometers (75 miles) northeast of the capital,
Freetown, was the scene of recent heavy fighting. Rebel fighters
battling against defense forces from a West African coalition army
known as ECOMOG succeeded in pushing coalition forces into a
``tactical retreat,'' according to an ECOMOG statement. Sierra
Leone's Foreign Minister Sam Banya on Monday said virtually the
entire population of several thousand people fled Makeni. (SIERRA

 &UR; PHNOM PENH: Nuon Chea said.

<TEXT>
	   They were flown in the morning from Pailin, a former rebel
stronghold, to Hun Sen's residence on a military base outside the
capital. After five hours of talks, they checked in at the Phnom
Penh hotel where they were booked for the night.
	   ``This is the end of the Khmer Rouge,'' Khieu Samphan told a mob
of waiting reporters.
	   Neither looked well after months on the run while Khmer Rouge
territory fell under government control. Nuon Chea, 71, walked with
a cane. Khieu Samphan, 67, needed help up the stairs.
	   Khieu Samphan's normally white hair was dyed black in an
apparent attempt at disguise.
	   They later paid a call on Prince Norodom Ranariddh, president of
the National Assembly and son of King Norodom Sihanouk. Hun Sen
says that both have approved the defections.
	   Speaking to the British Broadcasting Corp. from Sweden, Thomas
Hammarberg, U.N. Special Representative for Human Rights in
Cambodia, said it would be ``extremely sad'' if the pair were not
charged and tried for crimes against humanity.
	   In the meeting with Hun Sen, they posed for pictures with Ieng
Sary, a Khmer Rouge leader pardoned in 1996 for his role in
genocide in exchange for making peace and leading thousands of
guerrillas out of a stalemated civil war.
	   Leading members of the Cambodian People's Party _ led by people
who, like Hun Sen, were once Khmer Rouge cadres before fleeing
bloody purges in the late 1970s _ joined the meeting.
	   In exchange for ending their part in the war _ all but over for
more than a year anyway _ Hun Sen said Monday he would not try
Khieu Samphan or Nuon Chea, slamming the door on international
pressure to bring them before a tribunal overseas or a Cambodian
court.
	   It was Nuon Chea's first visit to the capital since the Khmer
Rouge were overthrown in 1979 by a Vietnamese invasion. Khieu
Samphan came to Phnom Penh in 1991 after a peace treaty _ later
broken by the Khmer Rouge _ was signed. He was stoned by a Hun
Sen-controlled mob.
	   In the past two years, granting pardons to Khmer Rouge leaders
ended their war and gave Cambodia new hope rebuilding. But now,
calls are rising for someone to be held accountable.
	   The Maoist revolutionaries won a civil war in 1975 and forced
Cambodians into slave labor camps. About one person in five
perished from overwork, starvation, disease and executions.
	   Khieu Samphan was the nominal leader, though he is generally
viewed as a front-man for those with real power. Nuon Chea was seen
as Pol Pot's second-in-command and chief political theorist.
	   Pol Pot died in April of a heart attack.
	   Khieu Samphan said he had separated ``a long time ago'' from the
only chieftain still at large, Ta Mok, known as ``The Butcher,''
who is somewhere on the Thai border with perhaps 100 die-hard
loyalists.

	   MERIMBULA, Australia (AP) _ Navy pilot Tanzi Lea peered down
into mountainous seas and was carried back 20 years to the 1979
Fastnet race where 15 sailors perished.
	   Lea was the pilot of a navy Sea King helicopter which hauled two
dead sailors, Jim Lawler and Michael Bannister, out of Bass Strait
Tuesday. Four bodies have been found and two sailors are presumed
drowned from the deadliest Sydney-to-Hobart race in history.
	   He was a member of Britain's Royal Navy during the Fastnet
rescue off the south west coast of Ireland where only 85 yachts
finished out of 303 starters because of high winds and punishing
waves.
	   ``The seas were as big as I saw during rescues in the Fastnet
race 20 years ago,'' Lea told The Associated Press after arriving
back with the two bodies Tuesday. ``Under those circumstances
you've got to be careful and act prudently.''
	   Lea, now with the Australian navy, was involved throughout this
search and rescue process. He said the weather was at its worst
Sunday and Monday but had calmed considerably by the time his
helicopter reached the bodies Tuesday.
	   ``A big depression formed quickly and although a change was
expected I don't think people thought it would be this bad,'' Lea
said.
	   Lawler and Bannister were believed to be from the veteran cutter
Winston Churchill. Another crew member, John Dean, is presumed
drowned, while six others were carried to safety.
	   Two of the men saved were in a life raft which had its bottom
torn away by heavy seas. A wave knocked their three mates out of
reach.
	   Shane Pashley, a navy diver, reached the two crew members who
had managed to hang onto the remnants of their life raft.
	   ``We winched the first guy up who was absolutely exhausted, the
waves were crashing over the top of the raft which made it very
difficult as I was continually dragged under the water,'' Pashley
told AP. ``Once we'd winched him up we put him on the floor of the
aircraft and turned the heaters up because he was suffering from
exposure.''
	   The harness was sent down for the second survivor but it snagged
on the life raft. He was eventually hauled aboard the helicopter.
	   ``One bloke said he knew where the other guys were but we
couldn't do anything as we were nearly out of fuel,'' Pashley said.
``They were just really tired and very thirsty, one of the guys was
only wearing a spray jacket and shorts.''
	   Pashley, like most Australians, has vivid memories of the rescue
of English yachtie Tony Bullimore, who showed unrestrained joy
after being found following four days alone at sea in early 1997.
	   But there was no great sense of celebration for Pashley.
	   ``There were no Tony Bullimore-style kisses,'' he said. ``They
were just done.''

<TEXT>
	   HOBART, Australia (AP) _ United States billionaire Larry
Ellison, teary-eyed after battling through deadly waves in the
Sydney-to-Hobart yacht race Tuesday, said he had never experienced
worse conditions at sea.
	   Ellison, the founder and chief executive of computer giant
Oracle, won his second Sydney-to-Hobart race but arrived in Hobart
early Tuesday to a funereal atmosphere.
	   Asked if he would come back again, Ellison said, ``My first
reaction is not if I live to a thousand years. But who knows?''
	   ``It was just awful, I've never experienced anything remotely
like this,'' Ellison said. ``It's been a very emotional experience
to get here. This is not what this is supposed to be about. A lot
of us are upset.''
	   Ellison said it was an extraordinarily difficult journey as his
yacht battled ``right through the eye of a hurricane'' and his crew
heard by radio of the deaths in the battered fleet.
	   Sayonara finished the race in two days, 20 hours, three minutes
and 32 seconds, but missing the record time was irrelevant to the
shaken crew, which included media magnate Rupert Murdoch's son
Lachlan.
	   ``Guys were knocked down time and time again, but kept getting
up to do what had to be done to keep us alive,'' Ellison said.
``It's a tough crew, but the guys were choked up. We were learning
of people dying.''
	   As many as six sailors are believed to have perished, with four
bodies found and two presumed drowned, in the worst tragedy to hit
the race in its 54-year history.
	   Sayonara crossed the finishing line to a subdued welcome by a
smaller-than-usual spectator fleet and dockside crowd. The 23-man
crew aboard the maxi were safe, except for one who had a broken
ankle.
	   A welcome celebration was postponed and the trophy presentation
was delayed until January 2.
	   ``That's as tough as it gets,'' said Sayonara's helmsman Chris
Dickson. ``Being here first is nice but being here at all is a big
thing and we're thinking about those who are still out there, not
thinking too much about how we've done.''
	   New Zealander Dickson, who said he has experienced similar
conditions in the Whitbread Around the World race, was unsure if he
would attempt this event again.
	   ``Anyone who is not scared in those conditions is not human,''
Dickson said. ``For a long time in Bass Strait we were not racing.
Nor was anyone else.''
	   Murdoch, chief executive of family-owned Australian newspaper
business News Limited, said the race was a great tragedy which the
crew was still trying to absorb.
	   ``Everyone here is very saddened and it gives you mixed feelings
about being part of it all,'' Murdoch said.

	   ROME (AP) _ Nearly 200 illegal refugees fleeing violence or
hardship at home reached Italy's southern shores in rubber dinghies
on Tuesday, police said.
	   Encouraged by calm seas, more than 1,000 immigrants from Kosovo,
Iraq, Turkey and northern Africa have made the journey across the
Adriatic in the past week, Italian news reports said.
	   Renewed fighting between Serbs and ethnic Albanian rebels in
Kosovo also has sent the number of ethnic Albanian arrivals
soaring.
	   At least 27 of Tuesday's arrivals were from Kosovo.
	   The 187 would-be immigrants discovered by police Tuesday were
taken to detention centers in the region of Puglia, at the ``heel''
of the Italian peninsula, near where the refugees reached shore.
Authorities must now decide whether to grant the immigrants
residency documents or send them back home.

In campaign stop, Netanyahu strikes familiar theme: Jerusalem
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photos JRL-101-104
 &UR; By MARK LAVIE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who is
fighting an uphill battle to get re-elected, on Tuesday prayed at
the Western Wall, Judaism's holiest site, and struck a theme that
helped him win in 1996 _ a pledge to keep Jerusalem united.
	   Netanyahu's campaign began in earnest after a parliamentary
committee on Tuesday confirmed May 17 as the date for elections,
more than a year ahead of schedule.
	   Netanyahu faces a growing field of challengers, including
members of his own Likud Party who either seek to wrest the party's
nomination from him or plan to run on their own slate.
	   In 1996, he narrowly defeated incumbent Prime Minister Shimon
Peres. The Netanyahu campaign slogan ``Peres will divide
Jerusalem'' was in part credited with giving Netanyahu his victory.
	   At the time, Netanyahu accused Peres of making too many
concessions to the Palestinians who hope to set up a future capital
in east Jerusalem, the sector Israel captured from Jordan in the
1967 Mideast war and later annexed into its capital.
	   On Tuesday, the secular Netanyahu arrived at the Wall, the last
remnant of the Jewish Temple destroyed by the Romans in 70 A.D.,
wearing a black skullcap and holding a prayer book. He caressed the
honey-colored stones and read psalms about Jerusalem.
	   In the Jewish calendar, Tuesday marks the first day of the Roman
siege of ancient Jerusalem and religious Jews observe it by fasting
from dawn to dusk.
	   ``This is an important date in Jewish history,'' Netanyahu said,
adding that since the Roman siege, Jews have been struggling to
regain control over Jerusalem and keep it united.
	   ``This is very much the struggle we are engaged in now, and I
come here to renew my strength and to draw encouragement from
generations of Jews who prayed that we would be here and that we
will stay here,'' Netanyahu said.
	   Netanyahu's trip to the Wall also appeared to be an attempt to
restore his standing among ultra-Orthodox and observant Jews who
voted solidly for him in 1996. The religious group Habad, which
actively campaigned for Netanyahu in the previous election, has
withdrawn its support, saying the prime minister had broken a
secret pledge not to transfer West Bank land to the Palestinians.
	   Some worshippers appeared annoyed rather than pleased by
Netanyahu's pilgrimage, saying the extensive security forced them
to wait for more than an hour on a fast day.
	   ``They checked my phylacteries, everything, and by the time they
were done it was almost too late to pray,'' said Yehiel Ben David,
a seminary student from Jerusalem.
	   One ultra-Orthodox Jew did not let the Netanyahu visit disrupt
his plans. He pressed a mobile phone against the Wall. On the other
end of the line were relatives from France who recited prayers.

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Workers voted Tuesday to continue a strike at the
Arc de Triomphe, but said they hoped their labor dispute would soon
be resolved in ongoing talks.
	   About 60 employees work at the monument at the top of the
Champs-Elysees. Union officials say the staff is overworked and
that more staff must be hired. It has been closed to the public
since Saturday.
	   ``We hope to solve this tonight,'' said Francoise Pinson,
spokeswoman for the Union of Cultural Affairs Personnel, members of
which were meeting on Tuesday with Culture Ministry officials.
	   Built between 1806 and 1836 to honor Napoleon's victories, the
Arc de Triomphe draws about 1.4 million visitors a year. Winding
stairways lead up to the roof, with a view of the Paris skyline.
	   Strikes in recent weeks have also hit the Orsay, Louvre and
Grand Palais museums, with employees making similar demands for
more staff to handle larger crowds. Workers also recently went on
strike at the Eiffel Tower.

Greek, Greek-Cypriot leaders hold crucial talks on missiles

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout to LEAD with Clerides leaving for Nicosia,
missile announcement expected there. ADDS byline. Minor editing. &QL; 
 &UR; By ELENA BECATOROS &QC;

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Greeks and their Cypriot allies held
crucial talks Tuesday aimed at defusing a political crisis from
Cyprus' decision to deploy Russian-made missiles.
	   Speculation has increased that the S-300 anti-aircraft missiles
will be diverted from Cyprus to the southern Greek island of Crete.
	   But both Cypriot President Glafcos Clerides and Greek Premier
Costas Simitis gave nothing away after their meeting, which was
also attended by the Greek defense and foreign ministers.
	   Clerides headed straight for the airport to return to Nicosia in
time for a meeting of the policy-making Greek Cypriot National
Council scheduled for later in the day.
	   An announcement on the future of the missiles was expected to be
made by Clerides after the National Council meeting.
	   Diverting the missiles to Crete could defuse tensions with
Turkey, which has threatened military action to stop the missiles'
deployment on war-divided Cyprus.
	   The United States and NATO have criticized Clerides' decision
two years ago to purchase the missiles, fearing conflict between
NATO members Turkey and Greece. Athens has a defense pact with the
Greek Cypriots.
	   Cyprus has been divided into a Greek Cypriot-controlled south
and a Turkish-occupied north since 1974 when Turkey invaded after a
short-lived coup by supporters of union with Greece.
	   The missiles issue has also caused political tensions in Cyprus,
where the outcome of Tuesday's meeting could affect the survival of
Clerides' government.
	   The Socialist EDEK party, which holds the ministries of defense
and education, has warned it will withdraw from the government if
the missiles are not deployed as planned.
	   Other opposition parties maintain Clerides should resign,
following his promise to do so if the missiles fail to arrive.
	   The Cypriot president had said previously that he would agree to
cancel the missiles' deployment only if Turkey accepted his
demilitarization proposal, or if there was progress in the
U.N.-sponsored talks for the reunification of the island.
	   A U.N. Security Council resolution adopted unanimously last week
called for a reduction of weapons and troops in Cyprus and the
resumption of the talks.

Papers: Saudi budget deficit realistic, reflects global oil crisis
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   RIYADH, Saudi Arabia (AP) _ Saudi Arabia's projected 1999 budget
deficit of 44 billion riyals (dlrs 11.73 billion) is realistic and
reflects the ongoing oil crisis in world markets, Saudi newspapers
said Tuesday.
	   ``The budget, by all standards, is progressive and can be
considered as a step forward in the challenging path of the
economic conditions which we hope are temporary,'' the daily
al-Jazeera said.
	   Saudi newspaper usually reflect the government's political and
economic policies.
	   On Monday, Saudi Arabia, the world's largest oil producer and
exporter, announced that its budget deficit in 1998 expanded 155.5
percent to 46 billion riyals (dlrs 12.26 billion), from an original
forecast of 18 billion riyals (dlrs 4.8 billion).
	   Acknowledging that the falling oil prices _ the lowest in more
than a decade _ will continue to take their toll on the economy,
the government said that 1999's projected budget deficit will be 44
billion riyals (dlrs 11.73 billion), 4.3 percent lower than 1998.
	   More than 80 percent of the government revenues come from oil
exports and the gloomy forecast for 1999 indicates that Saudi
officials do not expect significant rise in oil prices in the
coming year.
	   Both 1998 and 1999 deficit are the widest budget gaps in recent
years.
	   The Saudi fiscal year begins Jan. 1.
	   The 1999 budget forecast expenditures at 165 billion riyals
(dlrs 44 billion), down 12.7 percent from 1998's actual spending of
189 billion riyals (dlrs 50.4 billion).
	   The 1998 expenditures figure showed the government managed to
cut spending by only 3.5 percent from the projected spending of 196
billion riyals (dlrs 52.26 billion).
	   The budget plan projects the total revenues of 1999 at 121
billion riyals (dlrs 32.2 billion), 15 percent lower than actual
income of 143 billion riyals (dlrs 38.1 billion) in 1998.
	   Finance Minister Ibrahim al-Assaf was reported as saying that
``there is hope that circumstances will improve.''
	   ``But financial planning must reflect the current conditions,''
the daily Al-Eqtissadiyah quoted him as saying.
	   However, the budget statement did not say which oil price level
the government is expecting in 1999.
	   Saudi Arabia's current oil output quota is around 8 million
barrels a day, but the Saudi oil is selling for less than dlrs 10 a
barrel, compared with dlrs 14.5 at the beginning of the year.
	   The oil sector plunged 34.8 percent in 1998 because of the
prices fall, but most of other sectors are showing positive signs,
the budget statement said.
	   The government is expected to continue financing the budget
deficit through borrowing from the local market, in which it offers
a weekly 2-billion riyals (dlrs 533 million) treasury bills issue.

Jordanian pharmacists' group plans to defy sanctions on Iraq
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JOHN HALABY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ The main pharmacists' group in Jordan
pledged Tuesday to ship drugs and medical equipment to Iraq in
defiance of U.N. sanctions.
	   The Jordanian Pharmacists Association, whose members own 1,600
pharmacies and 12 drug factories, will dispatch trucks to Iraq next
Monday carrying ``large shipments,'' said the group's chairman, Dr.
Abdul Rahim Issa.
	   Issa, however, acknowledged that Jordanian authorities may
prevent the trucks from crossing the border into Iraq. If that
happens, the trucks ``will turn back,'' he said.
	   Jordanian government officials were not immediately available
for comment.
	   U.N. sanctions imposed on Iraq after its 1990 invasion of Kuwait
ban it from importing or exporting most goods. Humanitarian items
such as food and medicine are allowed, but every sale has to be
approved by a U.N. sanctions committee. The committee's job is to
ensure that seemingly harmless exports to Iraq cannot be used in
its weapons industries.
	   Issa said the association has decided to sell its drugs in Iraq,
at low prices, without ``obtaining approval from the U.N. Sanctions
Committee.''
	   He said the association has asked all drug stores, factories,
and medical equipment shops in Jordan to contribute for the
shipments.
	   ``We have taken this action to support and back the Iraqi
people, who have suffered the unjust embargo for eight years,'' he
said.
	   Issa called upon other business associations in Jordan and other
Arab countries to defy the embargo.
	   On Monday, the association began a boycott of American and
British drugs and medical equipment to protest against U.S.-British
airstrikes on Iraq from Dec. 16 to Dec. 19.
	   Meanwhile, Egyptian newspapers reported Tuesday that the
Egyptian Pharmacists Syndicate has decided to boycott some 74
widely used American and British medicines, and instructed its
members to sell locally made alternatives.
	   The syndicate said it is considering widening the boycott to
include more drugs.
	   The airstrikes on Iraq followed a complaint by U.N. weapons
inspectors that Iraq is hindering their mission to dismantle the
country's weapons of mass destruction.
	   Until the U.N. inspectors certify that Iraq is free of nuclear,
chemical and biological weapons and long-range missiles, the United
Nations cannot lift the trade sanctions.

More international verifiers arriving, NATO warns warring sides
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MISHA SAVIC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) - With a tenuous truce apparently
holding, about 100 international observers were en route Tuesday to
Kosovo to shore up efforts to minimize fighting in the
ethnic-Albanian majority Serbian province amid new NATO warnings of
possible intervention.
	   Their arrival will boost the Kosovo verification mission to
about 700 people, with the envisaged total of 2,000 expected to be
reached by mid-January, said Sandy Blyth, a spokesman for the
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which runs the
operation.
	   The arrivals follow violence last week in the north of the
province that further frayed a shaky de-facto truce established in
October. Authorities seeking to banish a threatened NATO strike
then agreed to end a months-long crackdown on Kosovo's ethnic
Albanians that left hundreds dead and hundreds of thousands _ most
of them ethnic Albanians _ on the run.
	   Reacting to the recent upsurge, NATO said from its headquarters
in Brussels, Belgium, on Tuesday that it remained ``ready to
intervene'' if violence intensifies in the province and demanded
both sides respect the informal cease fire.
	   In the wake of the recent fighting, Serbs from the region most
affected demanded protection from Slobodan Milosevic, president of
Yugoslavia, of which Serbia is the main republic. In an open
letter, made public in Belgrade, they said they don't want to
continue being victims of ethnic Albanian guerrillas seeking the
province's independence.
	   The Serbs, from the northern Podujevo region, said this was
their last ``desperate'' appeal to the Yugoslav authorities before
they pack up and flee Kosovo because of ``the terror'' of ethnic
Albanian guerrillas who hold much of the region in their hands.
	   ``We demand that you use all available means to protect our
lives and territory,'' the letter said. ``If you are not ready to
help us, tell us loud and clear so we don't keep on dying in
vain.''
	   The fighting began on the Christmas Eve and lasted for four
days, resulting in 15 deaths, dozens of wounded and at least 5,000
displaced people.
	   Serbs, a tiny minority in the Podujevo region, said that 13
Serbs still are unaccounted for after the fighting. They said they
evacuated some 200 of their children from the region, where ethnic
Albanian guerrillas continue patrols.
	   Blyth said Kosovo Tuesday was ``reasonably quiet ... although
there are still areas which are tense.''
	   He said Italians, Finns, Germans, Swedes, Turks, Americans,
Britons, Canadians, Russians, Spaniards, Norwegians, French,
Estonians and a Lithuanian were in the latest group of observers.

Official: Russia, Belarus to introduce single currency, budget in
</HEADLINE>
2000 &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia and Belarus will merge closer by
introducing a single currency and a joint budget in 2000, a top
Russian official said Tuesday.
	   But each country will also preserve its own, national budget,
said First Deputy Prime Minister Vadim Gustov, without explaining
how the new currency would work or to what extent funds would be
shared between the two nations.
	   Presidents Boris Yeltsin of Russian and Alexander Lukashenko of
Belarus signed an agreement last week calling for a merger of the
two former Soviet republics as early as next year with a single
currency and harmonized taxes.
	   But no definite schedule has been set, and officials have talked
about holding a referendum on the plan.
	   Russia's economy is gripped by its worst crisis since the Soviet
collapse, but Belarus is in an even worse shape, with virtually all
assets and markets under government control.
	   Soviet-style economic management by the authoritarian Lukashenko
has led to major food shortages in the republic. Rationing cards
have been introduced in many regions, and long lines form in stores
for basic goods.
	   The introduction of a single currency may mean that Belarus
would be able to print the money _ and Belarus would be likely to
do it with relish.
	   Lukashenko's government printed money on a grand scale in the
past, creating soaring inflation. Russia has so far tried to limit
money printing to solve its economic problems.
	   Gustov stressed Tuesday that rules still need to be worked out
to regulate the countries' rights to print the joint currency, the
Interfax news agency reported.
	   Lukashenko, a admirer of the Soviet Union, has long pushed for
uniting his nation of 10 million people with Russia's 147 million
people. In 1996, he and Yeltsin signed a union agreement, boosting
political, economic and military ties between the two nations, but
stopping short of creating one state.
	   Belarus relies on Russia's energy resources and has run up a
huge debt, and Lukashenko wants a merger to solve Belarus' economic
problems.
	   But many believe that the main motive behind Lukashenko's drive
for union is his ambition to run for the Russian presidency.
	   The West and Russian liberals assail Lukashenko for his
crackdown on the opposition and the independent media. The
eccentric president also likes to defy western democracies, and
accuse them of unspecified plots against him.
	   Meanwhile, Russia's deputy minister for relations with former
Soviet republics, Igor Savelsky, said Tuesday that Russian nuclear
weapons will not be placed on the territory of Belarus.
	   After the 1991 Soviet collapse, Belarus got rid of the nuclear
weapons it inherited from the Soviet Union.

NATO ``ready to intervene'' in Kosovo
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ NATO on Tuesday said it was ``ready to
intervene'' in Kosovo if violence intensifies in the breakaway
Serbian province and demanded Yugoslav authorities and armed ethnic
Albanians respect a ceasefire.
	   NATO Secretary General Javier Solana urged the two sides
fighting for control of the province ``not to endanger the fragile
security situation'' and noted that the ``activation order''
authorizing NATO airstrikes remained in place.
	   ``NATO is ready to intervene if the situation requires,'' said
Solana.
	   The 16-nation alliance issued the airstrike threat in October to
persuade the Serbs to stop their crackdown against the ethnic
Albanian rebels in Kosovo, a province of Yugoslavia's dominant
republic of Serbia. The attacks were put on hold after Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic agreed on a truce and pulled out some
of his forces.
	   Fighting flared again last week, leaving at least 15 people dead
and forcing thousands of civilians to flee into snow-covered hills.
	   Solana said he was in permanent contact with NATO's military
commanders and the unarmed international monitors in Kosovo who
negotiated a ceasefire Sunday to halt the latest fighting.

Turkish Cypriots accuse Greek side of firing shots at dividing

line &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) _ Turkish Cypriot authorities accused the
Greek side Tuesday of opening fire at the dividing line that
separates rival Turkish and Greek sectors of the Mediterranean
island of Cyprus.
	   The shots were fired at Turkish Cypriot security forces from a
car traveling along the road between the Turkish sector and the
British base of Dhekelia, Turkey's Anatolia news service said.
	   There were no injuries.
	   Turkish Cypriot authorities did not return fire. They protested
to U.N. and British officials who monitor the buffer zone, warning
they would respond to such attacks in the future.
	   Tuesday's shooting was the fifth in a series of similar
incidents over the past few months at the U.N.-patrolled buffer
zone, according to Turkish Cypriots, who have demanded increased
security measures at the dividing line.
	   Cyprus has been divided since 1974, when Turkey invaded the
island following a short-lived coup by supporters of union with
Greece.
	   Turkey maintains 35,000 troops in the north, some of which are
positioned only yards (meters) away from Greek Cypriot troops.

Maier leads Austrian sweep in fourth season downhill

<TEXT>
	   BORMIO, Italy (AP) _ Austrian ski superstar Hermann Maier
captured his fourth World Cup season victory in Tuesday's downhill
at Bormio as he led a 1-6 sweep by Austrian skiers in the last race
of the year.
	   Maier, the defending World Cup champion known as ``The
Herminator,'' mastered the icy and twisty Stelvio course in the
winning time of one minute, 54.51 seconds in a repeat of his last
year's triumph in this Italian alpine resort.
	   It was the 14th World Cup career victory _ the third in downhill
_ for the Austrian ace, who exploded to international fame last
season by winning the World Cup overall, Super-G and giant slalom
titles and two Olympic golds at Nagano, Japan.
	   Maier also earned Austria the first downhill victory on the
men's circuit in the fourth speed race of the 1998-99 campaign.
	   Fritz Strobl and Stephan Eberharter placed second and third
respectively, to complete the all-Austrian podium.
	   Strobl trailed Maier by 0.70 seconds. Eberharter had a gap of
1.28 seconds.
	   Three other Austrians _ Hans Knauss, Werner Franz and Hannes
Trinkl _ placed from fourth to sixth in an unprecedented 1-6 finish
in men's downhill.
	   Austrian skiers had swept the top nine places for an all-time
World Cup record at a Super-G race in Innsbruck last week.
	   Swiss Bruno Kernen, the defending world downhill champion, was
the first non-Austrian finisher in seventh place.
	   Maier, who had captured two Super-Gs and one giant slalom
earlier this season, strengthened his overall lead in the Cup
standings by pocketing 100 points, for a total of 640 after 13
events.
	   His closest rival, Norwegian Lasse Kjus, was sidelined with a
bronchitis and did not start in Bormio.
	   Kjus had dominated the two first season downhills in Val D'Isere
and Val Gardena and had placed second to Italy's Kristian Ghedina
in the third.
	   Kjetil Aandre Amodt, another leading Norwegian skier, and
injured Olympic downhill champion Jean-Luc Cretiter of France were
also missing at Bormio, the site of the 1985 world championships
which will host the world cup finals in 2000.
	   The men's World Cup continues at Kranjska Gora, Slovenia, with a
slalom and a giant slalom, on Jan. 5-6.

Peace activists file appeal to halt settlement expansion
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Peace activists asked the Supreme Court on
Tuesday to force the government to dismantle mobile homes set up by
Jewish settlers as part of a West Bank land grab.
	   The Peace Now group and dovish legislator Dedi Zucker said they
filed the appeal after Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai ignored
repeated calls to remove 60 trailers from 10 sites in the West
Bank.
	   Mordechai's spokesman, Avi Binyahu, refused comment.
	   The mobiles homes have been set up since the October signing of
the Wye River peace agreement under which Israel was to withdraw
from 13 percent of the West Bank.
	   Settler leaders said they hoped to prevent the transfer of some
of the land by placing trailers on hilltops near settlements.
Israeli Foreign Minister Ariel Sharon has encouraged them.
	   The Wye agreement stipulates that neither side should take
unilateral action. Palestinians and Israeli peace activists claim
the settler land grabs violate the Wye accord.
	   Settlement expansion has been viewed as one of the major
obstacles in the peace process and has been criticized by the
Clinton administration.
	   Zucker, a legislator from the opposition Meretz Party, said he
was concerned that settlement activists would step up their
campaign in the months leading up to the May 17 elections.
	   In this period, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who needs
settler support to win re-election, would be unlikely to confront
potential voters by cracking down on illegal settlement.
	   The Supreme Court petition would force Mordechai to dismantle
the 60 mobile homes set up so far and prevent similar actions in
the future.

leader &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ZAGREB, Croatia (AP) _ More then 100 people attended a memorial
Mass for Croatia's World War II fascist leader on the 39th
anniversary of his death, the daily Novi list reported.
	   Ante Pavelic headed a Nazi puppet state that murdered hundreds
of thousands of people, mostly Serbs, Jews and Gypsies, but also
Croats opposing his Nazi-style regime.
	   He died and was buried in Madrid, Spain, in December of 1959.
	   Three right-wing parliamentarians attended Monday's Mass, Novi
list reported.
	   President Franjo Tudjman, who steered Croatia to independence
after it broke away from Yugoslavia in 1991, himself is also often
accused by critics of cultivating nationalism that harks back to
the World War II state. He has repeatedly declared that wartime
Croatia was not simply a fascist state, but also an expression of
Croat desire for independence.
	   Croatian nationalists _ the Ustasha _ ran 28 death camps during
their rule between 1941 and 1945. Dinko Sakic, a commander of
Jasenovac, the most infamous of the camps, was indicted for war
crimes earlier this month, half a year after he was extradited from
Argentina.
	   His wife Nada-Esperanza, who was extradited a few months later,
also faces war crimes charges.

Ugandan, Rwandan presidents meet amid reports of fighting between
</HEADLINE>
their allied forces &QL; 
 &UR; By HENRY WASSWA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KAMPALA, Uganda (AP) _ Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni and his
Rwandan counterpart met Tuesday as reports circulated of growing
tensions between their allied forces that are backing rebels in
neighboring Congo, a spokeswoman said.
	   Both governments have denied the reported clashes between
Ugandan and Rwandan soldiers.
	   Meanwhile, the government-owned New Vision newspaper said
Tuesday Museveni had ordered the arrest of several Ugandan army
officers suspected of dealing illegally in gold, timber and other
resources in Congo.
	   Museveni's spokeswoman, Hope Kivengere, said the president met
with Rwandan President Pasteur Bizimungu in the southwestern town
of Kabale on the Rwandan border ``to discuss the security situation
in the region.''
	   The meeting was held against a backdrop of conflicting and
unconfirmed newspaper reports of tensions between the Ugandan and
Rwandan troops backing Congolese rebels in their five-month war to
oust Congolese President Laurent Kabila.
	   Kivengere dismissed reports Sunday and Monday in the independent
Monitor newspaper that Ugandan and Rwandan troops had clashed Dec.
11-15 in eastern Congo, leaving 30 Rwandans and eight Ugandans
dead.
	   The reports said the fighting erupted over disagreements about
strategy and alleged brutality against civilians by Rwandan forces.
	   ``We don't pay any attention to the Monitor; they often print a
lot of fiction,'' Kivengere said.
	   Both Rwanda and Uganda have acknowledged sending men and
military equipment to the region in support of the rebellion that
broke out Aug. 2 to oust Congolese President Laurent Kabila.
	   The two governments say they want to clear the area of Ugandan
and Rwandan rebels operating from bases there.
	   However, common interests appeared to diverge last month when
Congolese businessman Jean-Pierre Bemba declared himself,
apparently with Ugandan support, to be leader of a new rebel
faction that was an alternative to the Rwandan-backed Congolese
Democratic Coalition led by Ernest Wamba dia Wamba.
	   Adding to the confusion Tuesday, New Vision, citing an anonymous
army officer, said Museveni ordered the arrest of the officers
following newspaper reports that some of his soldiers posted in
eastern Congo were spending most of their time trying to make
money.
	   Defense spokesman Steven Kavuma was not available for comment.
	   A senior military officer and four other people were killed in
September when a twin-engine Islander plane going from Kampala to
northeastern Congo, reportedly on a gold-buying mission, crashed
under mysterious circumstances in the foothills of the Rwenzori
Mountains that straddle the border between Uganda and Congo.
	   Contradictory government statements and reports further clouded
the actual events.
	   Citing other unnamed sources, New Vision said since the start of
the rebellion, there has been an influx of Ugandans, most of them
relatives of army officers, on trading missions in eastern Congo.

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Two top Khmer Rouge leaders came to
Phnom Penh on Tuesday and said they were ``sorry'' for their brutal
rule during the 1970s, but asked their countrymen to ``let bygones
be bygones.''
	   Prime Minister Hun Sen met Khieu Samphan and Nuon Chea, part of
the inner circle of the late Pol Pot, with smiles and handshakes
after cementing their defection _ in essence, surrender _ with
public pledges not to try them for genocide.
	   At a hostile news conference later, the elderly revolutionaries
faced questions whether they felt any remorse for causing the
deaths of as many as 2 million of their countrymen.
	   Many of the Cambodian reporters present lost close relatives
under the Khmer Rouge. With a trial ruled out, the Khmer Rouge
leaders may never again face such a critical audience.
	   ``Yes, sorry, very sorry,'' Khieu Samphan said, looking red and
sullen. ``We would like to apologize and ask our compatriots to
forget the past so our nation can concentrate on the future. Let
bygones be bygones.''
	   The Maoist revolutionaries won a civil war in 1975 and forced
the population into slave labor camps. About one Cambodian in five
perished from overwork, starvation, disease and executions.
	   Khieu Samphan was the nominal leader, though he is generally
viewed as a front-man for the notorious Pol Pot and others who held
real power. Nuon Chea was seen as Pol Pot's second-in-command and
chief political theorist. Pol Pot died in April of a heart attack.
	   Neither man accepted personal responsibility Tuesday. As the
half-hour news conference at a hotel broke up, they were mobbed and
demands shouted for personal apologies to the families of those who
perished.
	   Khieu Samphan indicated there would be no trial, especially one
abroad by an international tribunal. The United Nations recently
sent a team of experts to weigh the possibility of such a court.
	   ``Please let the Cambodian people resolve this problem,'' Khieu
Samphan said.
	   ``As you know, Hun Sen, prime minister of the royal government,
has warmly welcomed us,'' Khieu Samphan said. ``If we have to say
who was wrong and who was right, etc., etc., we cannot have
national reconciliation. We cannot put an end to the war.''
	   Nuon Chea, asked who was to blame for the massacre of Cambodians
under Khmer Rouge rule, echoed: ``Let's consider that an old issue.
I cannot clarify that.''
	   ``We are very sorry, not just for the human lives, but also
animal lives that were lost in the war,'' Nuon Chea said.
	   The pair were flown from Pailin, a former rebel stronghold, to
Hun Sen's residence on a military base near the capital.
	   Leading members of the Cambodian People's Party _ led by people
who, like Hun Sen, were once Khmer Rouge cadres before fleeing
bloody purges in the late 1970s _ joined the meeting.
	   After five hours of talks, the rebels checked in at the Phnom
Penh hotel where they were booked for the night.
	   ``This is the end of the Khmer Rouge,'' Khieu Samphan told
waiting reporters.
	   Neither looked well after months on the run while Khmer Rouge
territory fell under government control. Nuon Chea, 71, walked with
a cane. Khieu Samphan, 67, needed help up the stairs.
	   Khieu Samphan's normally white hair was dyed black in an
apparent attempt at disguise.
	   They later called on Prince Norodom Ranariddh, president of the
National Assembly and son of King Norodom Sihanouk. Hun Sen says
that both have approved the defections.
	   Speaking to the British Broadcasting Corp. from Sweden, Thomas
Hammarberg, U.N. Special Representative for Human Rights in
Cambodia, said it would be `extremely sad'' if the pair were not
charged and tried for crimes against humanity.
	   In the past two years, granting pardons to Khmer Rouge leaders
ended the war and gave Cambodia new hope of rebuilding. But now,
calls are rising for someone to be held accountable.
	   Khieu Samphan said he had separated ``a long time ago'' from the
only chieftain still at large, Ta Mok, known as ``The Butcher,''
who is somewhere on the Thai border with perhaps 100 loyalists.
	   Hun Sen defied international pressure Monday and said the men
would not be tried, saying it would revive civil war.
	   It was Nuon Chea's first visit to the capital since the Khmer
Rouge were overthrown in 1979 by a Vietnamese invasion.
	   Khieu Samphan came to Phnom Penh in 1991 after a peace treaty _
later broken by the Khmer Rouge _ was signed. He was stoned by a
Hun Sen-controlled mob.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ With a tenuous truce apparently
holding, about 100 international observers were heading Tuesday to
Kosovo to try to stop fighting in the ethnic-Albanian majority
Serbian province while NATO reiterated warnings of possible
intervention.
	   The observers' arrival will boost the Kosovo monitoring mission
to about 700 people, with the envisaged total of 2,000 expected to
be reached by mid-January, said Sandy Blyth, a spokesman for the
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which runs the
operation.
	   The arrivals follow violence last week in the north of the
province that further frayed a shaky de-facto truce established in
October. Authorities seeking to avert a threatened NATO strike then
agreed to end a months-long crackdown on Kosovo's separatist-minded
ethnic Albanians.
	   The months of violence left hundreds dead and hundreds of
thousands _ most of them ethnic Albanians _ on the run in Kosovo, a
province of the dominant Yugoslavian republic of Serbia.
	   Reacting to the recent upsurge, NATO said Tuesday from its
headquarters in Brussels, Belgium, that it remained ``ready to
intervene'' if violence intensifies in the province and demanded
that both sides respect the informal cease fire.
	   In the wake of the recent fighting, Serbs from the region most
affected demanded protection from Yugoslavian President Slobodan
Milosevic. In an open letter, made public in Belgrade, they said
they don't want to continue being victims of ethnic Albanian
guerrillas seeking the province's independence.
	   The Serbs, from the northern Podujevo region, said this was
their last ``desperate'' appeal to the Yugoslav authorities before
they pack up and flee Kosovo because of ``the terror'' of ethnic
Albanian guerrillas who control much of the region.
	   ``We demand that you use all available means to protect our
lives and territory,'' the letter said. ``If you are not ready to
help us, tell us loud and clear so we don't keep on dying in
vain.''
	   The most recent fighting began on Christmas Eve and lasted four
days, killing 15 people, wounding dozens and displacing at least
5,000.
	   Serbs, a tiny minority in the Podujevo region, said that 13
Serbs remained missing after the fighting. They said they evacuated
some 200 of their children from the region, where ethnic Albanian
guerrillas continue patrols.
	   Blyth said Tuesday that Kosovo was ``reasonably quiet ...
although there are still areas which are tense.''
	   He said Italians, Finns, Germans, Swedes, Turks, Americans,
Britons, Canadians, Russians, Spaniards, Norwegians, French,
Estonians and a Lithuanian were in the latest group of observers.

Star Turkish striker Sukur considers Juventus offer
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ Turkish striker Hakan Sukur is considering
a return to Turin _ not with his former club Torino but with
cross-town rival Juventus.
	   ``I received an offer from Juventus,'' the Galatasaray star told
the private NTV television Tuesday, confirming news reports that
Juve had offered dlrs 12 to 15 million for the transfer. ``I will
make my decision in a few days.''
	   Sukur, who had a brief stint with Torino three years ago, is
seeking a four-year, dlrs 8 million contract with Juventus, the
sports daily Foto Mac said Tuesday.
	   Despite opposition from coach Fatih Terim, the Galatasaray board
seems willing to let Sukur go to help ease the club's financial
crisis.
	   Galatasaray urgently needs dlrs 7 million to buy an alcohol
factory to raise revenue for the club, according to the daily paper
Turkiye. The club is reportedly having difficulties in paying the
salaries of some players.
	   Galatasaray's financial needs also stem from the recent approval
of a dlrs 122 million renovation project of the club's Ali Sami Yen
stadium.
	   Coach Terim was not interested in the club's financial problems.
	   ``The important thing is the club's interests,'' he said.
	   Sukur said Galatasaray's economic hardships would affect his
decision. He said he would also take into account the current
diplomatic rift between Italy and Turkey over Rome's refusal to
extradite Kurdish rebel leader Abdullah Ocalan.
	   ``The mothers of the martyrs are pressuring me not to go to
Italy,'' Sukur was quoted as saying in Foto Mac.
	   Ocalan's rebels have been fighting for autonomy in southeastern
Turkey. The conflict has claimed some 37,000 lives since 1984.
	   The tension between Italy and Turkey overshadowed a Championship
League game between Juventus and Galatasaray earlier this month.
The game, postponed by a week for fear of fan violence, ended in a
1-1 draw amid tight security in Istanbul on Dec. 2.
	   Sukur was the top scorer in the Turkish first division last
season with 32 goals for reigning champion Galatasaray.
	   Galatasaray has been eliminated from the Champions League but
still has a chance to clinch the domestic championship.
	   The club is currently third in the Turkish league, only one
point behind leader Fenerbahce.

Police warn Singapore politician against speaking publicly

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Threatened by uniformed police, one of
Singapore's few opposition party leaders gave a rare public speech
without a permit Tuesday, saying all other avenues for
disseminating information had been blocked by the government.
	   ``The constitution of Singapore guarantees me freedom of speech,
assembly and association. I'm exercising that right as a fellow
citizen of Singapore and a member of a political party,'' said Chee
Soon Juan, 36, secretary-general of the Singapore Democratic Party.
	   Standing on a lawn at Raffles Place in Singapore's business
district, Chee drew a crowd of more than 250 people to hear his
hour-long speech criticizing the government's economic, human
rights and foreign affairs policies.
	   Chee made statements seldom heard or read in Singapore. He read
detailed descriptions of alleged torture of political prisoners,
said that Senior Minister Lee Kuan Yew had been wrong to invest
public money in China, and stated that one of Burma's chief drug
lords comes and goes freely in Singapore, which has a death penalty
for drug traffickers.
	   ``The reason why the government doesn't permit politicians to
talk to you like this is because there's a lot of information they
don't want you to know,'' Chee said.
	   Superintendent Low Hui Hui of the central police station warned
Chee three times before he started speaking that addressing the
public without a permit from the Criminal Investigation Department
violates the Public Entertainment Law. ``I just advised him not to
proceed with the talk,'' said Low. ``If he does, we will open an
investigation.''
	   The night before Chee's speech the police force issued a
statement warning that anyone who gives a talk in a public place
without a permit is subject to a 5,000 Singapore dollars (dlrs
3,030) fine.
	   After the speech, as dozens of onlookers crowded around Chee to
ask follow-up questions, police tried to serve the politician with
a summons to appear for questioning.
	   Chee refused to take it and told the crowd that he intended to
speak at the same place and time next week. Chee, who said his
party has about 200 members, has unsuccessfully run twice for
Parliament. The 84-member legislature has been controlled for 38
years by the People's Action Party.
	   Chee said the government had banned his party's political video,
blocked information from being posted on the Internet about
candidates during the last election, refused or delayed until the
last minute issuing permits for public lectures, and fined him for
trying to sell his book on Asian human rights violations.
	   ``If the government is doing such a good job, why does it have
to have so many controls?'' Chee said. ``We had a very peaceful,
intelligent talk today,'' he said, noting that many in the crowd
were bank employees wearing ties or designer skirts. ``Do you see
anybody going on a riot or running rampant? The permit
(requirement) is here for political control.''
	   Speaking later in an interview on national television, a cabinet
minister said most Singaporeans aren't very interested in greater
political freedom for the regimented city-state.
	   ``No, I don't think that is the majority view in Singapore,''
said Information and Arts Minister George Yeo. ``You take this
economic crisis today. Many Singaporeans instinctively want a
strong government, a decisive government, and if you had general
elections now, I think a great many Singaporeans would vote
certainly for the PAP government.''

	   PIRAEUS, Greece (AP) _ Two time bombs exploded early Tuesday
outside bank branches of American Express and Barclays in Greece's
main port, causing damage but no injuries, police said.
	   The dynamite bombs exploded within six minutes of each other,
shortly after police received a warning from an anonymous caller
claiming to represent the little-known group Revolutionary Cells.
	   The daily newspaper Eleftherotypia said an anonymous caller to
its offices claimed the attacks were carried out as ``resistance to
the criminal NATO alliance.''
	   The caller also criticized the European Union and the United
States, adding that the attack was also a form of ``resistance to
... capitalist dictatorship,'' Eleftherotypia said.
	   Barclays bank sustained significant damage from the blast.
Windows were also shattered in nearby buildings and seven cars
parked nearby were also damaged, police said.
	   The American Express branch, located about 500 meters (547
yards) away, suffered less damage, mainly broken windows, said
authorities in Piraeus, about 10 kilometers (six miles) south of
central Athens.
	   In June, the Revolutionary Cells claimed responsibility for a
bomb blast outside the Athens offices of a government agency
responsible for hiring civil servants. Two police officers had been
slightly injured in that attack.
	   A number of small but prolific terrorist groups have carried out
more than 150 attacks in Greece this year, mostly firebombs against
offices and cars belonging to government officials, diplomats,
journalists and foreign companies. The attacks are usually carried
out late at night and rarely cause injury.

Greek, Greek-Cypriot leaders hold crucial talks on missiles

	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Greeks and their Cypriot allies held
crucial talks Tuesday aimed at defusing a political crisis stemming
from Cyprus' decision to deploy Russian-made missiles.
	   Speculation has increased that the S-300 anti-aircraft missiles
will be diverted from Cyprus to the southern Greek island of Crete.
	   But both Cypriot President Glafcos Clerides and Greek Premier
Costas Simitis gave nothing away after their meeting, which was
also attended by the Greek defense and foreign ministers.
	   Clerides headed straight for the airport to return to Nicosia in
time for a meeting of the policy-making Greek Cypriot National
Council scheduled for later in the day.
	   An announcement on the future of the missiles was expected to be
made by Clerides after the National Council meeting.
	   Diverting the missiles to Crete could defuse tensions with
Turkey, which has threatened military action to stop the missiles'
deployment on war-divided Cyprus.
	   The United States and NATO have criticized Clerides' decision
two years ago to purchase the missiles, fearing conflict between
NATO members Turkey and Greece. Athens has a defense pact with the
Greek Cypriots.
	   Cyprus has been divided into a Greek Cypriot-controlled south
and a Turkish-occupied north since 1974 when Turkey invaded after a
short-lived coup by supporters of union with Greece.
	   The missiles issue has also caused political tensions in Cyprus,
where the outcome of Tuesday's meeting could affect the survival of
Clerides' government.
	   The Socialist EDEK party, which holds the ministries of defense
and education, has warned it will withdraw from the government if
the missiles are not deployed as planned.
	   Other opposition parties maintain Clerides should resign,
following his promise to do so if the missiles fail to arrive.
	   The Cypriot president had said previously that he would agree to
cancel the missiles' deployment only if Turkey accepted his
demilitarization proposal, or if there was progress in the
U.N.-sponsored talks for the reunification of the island.
	   A U.N. Security Council resolution adopted unanimously last week
called for a reduction of weapons and troops in Cyprus and the
resumption of the talks.

Treason suspect sets off device in court, escapes amid mayhem
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KAMPALA, Uganda (AP) _ A man facing treason charges threw a
court into confusion Tuesday when he exploded a small, homemade
device and then escaped in a hail of gunfire, court officials and
eyewitnesses said.
	   Peter Ategeka, who was standing in the dock with 16 other men,
rubbed the explosive device with stones until it exploded, forcing
people in the courtroom to run for cover, the eyewitnesses said.
	   ``The prosecutor had just read the charges before the explosion
went off, and we had to rush out through the windows,'' said
Abdugadir Kiragga, a reporter for the government-owned New Vision
newspaper.
	   He said two radio reporters were trampled as they tried to
escape, and magistrate Margaret Tibulya quickly left for home.
	   Court clerk Ssenaburya told The Associated Press the device was
made from the hollow metallic handle of a shaving razor which
Ategeka appeared to have filled with phosphorous filed from the
heads of matches.
	   The accused were arrested in May in Kampala and were being
charged with trying to overthrow the government of President Yoweri
Museveni. The charge carries a mandatory death sentence on
conviction.
	   Prison warders fired into the air and blocked the exits,
apparently thwarting the escape of the other 16 men in the dock.
	   Last month, a man on trial for murder attempted to strangle a
woman magistrate in the same courtroom in downtown Kampala.

Sharon does not rule out bid for prime minister
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: INCORPORATES BC-Israel-Netanyahu, UPDATES with parliament
committee agreeing on proposed compromise of May 17 as date for
elections; adds byline &QL; 
 &UR; By MARK LAVIE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ In a new blow to Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu, his closest political ally, Foreign Minister Ariel
Sharon, said he hasn't ruled out running for the premier's post.
	   Parliament's Law Committee on Tuesday approved May 17 as the
date for new elections, more than a year ahead of schedule.
	   Netanyahu faces a growing field of challengers, including
members of his own Likud Party who either seek to wrest the party's
nomination from him or plan to run on their own slate.
	   With five candidates already in the race and popular former
armed forces chief of staff Amnon Shahak expected to announce his
bid next week, it is unlikely the elections will be determined in
the first round. If no candidate wins more than 50 percent, a
runoff will be held June 1.
	   In what looked like his first campaign stop, Netanyahu on
Tuesday prayed at the Western Wall, Judaism's holiest site, and
struck a theme that helped him win in 1996 _ a pledge to keep
Jerusalem united.
	   At the time, Netanyahu accused incumbent Prime Minister Shimon
Peres of making too many concessions to the Palestinians who hope
to set up a future capital in east Jerusalem, the sector Israel
captured from Jordan in the 1967 Mideast war.
	   Netanyahu's campaign team coin the slogan ``Peres will divide
Jerusalem,'' which was credited with helping the opposition leader
narrowly defeat Peres.
	   At the Wall on Tuesday, Netanyahu said Jews have been struggling
for centuries to regain control over Jerusalem and keep the city
united. ``This is very much the struggle we are engaged in now,''
he said.
	   Sharon's acknowledgement on Monday evening that he was
considering a bid for prime minister came as a surprise.
	   Only on Sunday, he had told Likud's Central Committee that he
did ``not want to be prime minister.'' Less than 24 hours later, he
said on a TV talk show that under certain circumstances, he might
enter the race.
	   ``There is a difference between `I don't want to be prime
minister' and running under special circumstances,'' Sharon said.
	   There was speculation he could enter the race if Netanyahu's
popularity drops or key leaders abandon the Likud party.
	   Sharon, a popular hawk and the most experienced minister in
Netanyahu's Cabinet, did not say whether he would challenge
Netanyahu for Likud Party leadership in January primaries or form
his own slate if he decides to run.
	   Sharon resigned his post as defense minister in 1983 after he
was held indirectly responsible for the massacre of hundreds of
Palestinians during Israel's military offensive to chase PLO
guerrillas out of Lebanon. Later, he served only in second-rank
posts despite his popularity.

Thailand's Veeraphol knocks out Tatsuyoshi of Japan to win WBC
</HEADLINE>
title

<TEXT>
	   OSAKA, Japan (AP) _ Veeraphol Nakonluang-Promotion of Thailand
knocked out defending champion Joichiro Tatsuyoshi of Japan in the
sixth round to win the World Boxing Council (WBC) bantamweight
title Tuesday night.
	   The knockout came at two minutes and 52 seconds into the sixth
round when Veeraphol landed a right on Tatsuyoshi's jaw following a
series of smashing blows.
	   Tatsuyoshi looked strong early in the fight, landing a series of
sharp blows against challenger Veeraphol in the second to take that
round.
	   But in the third round, the 30-year-old Veeraphol jolted
Tatsuyoshi with a sharp right blow to the face.
	   Veeraphol, WBC No. 5 contender, continued to punish Tatsuyoshi
with a series of jabs and sharp rights, before 10,000 spectators at
Osaka Municipal Central Gymnasium in Osaka, western Japan.
	   In the sixth round, Veeraphol knocked Tatsuyoshi down for the
first time in the fight with a straight left to his face.
	   When Tatsuyoshi got up, Veeraphol ended the battle with a series
of smashing left and right straight blows. Tatsuyoshi fell backward
to the floor and lay for about a minute before trainers and doctors
revived him.
	   ``I am very pleased,'' Veeraphol said of his victory.
	   Up until the fifth round, Tatsuyoshi was leading 48-47 on
American judge Gale Van Hoy's scorecard.
	   Veeraphol was ahead 49-46 on American judge Marty Sammon's card
and 48-47 on Mexican Ray Solis' card.
	   Tatsuyoshi was making his third defense of the title he won from
Thailand's Sirimongkol Nakornthorn-Parkview in November 1997.
	   It was Veeraphol's 21st victory, including 15 knockouts and one
defeat.
	   Tatsuyoshi, whose career has been threatened by a retina injury,
now has 17 victories, including 12 knockouts, against five defeats
and one draw.
	   Both Tatsuyoshi and Veerapol weighed 53.5 kilograms (118
pounds).

	   FREETOWN, Sierra Leone (AP) _ Rebel forces battling to oust
President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah have taken control of the central town
of Makeni, defense force officers said Tuesday.
	   Makeni, a strategic town about 120 kilometers (75 miles)
northeast of the capital, Freetown, was the scene of recent heavy
fighting.
	   Rebel fighters battling against a West African coalition army
known as ECOMOG succeeded in pushing the defense force into a
``tactical retreat,'' according to an ECOMOG statement.
	   Sierra Leone's Foreign Minister Sam Banya on Monday said
virtually the entire population of several thousand people fled
Makeni.
	   The rebel Revolutionary United Front has launched a series of
offensives in recent weeks to recapture ground lost to Nigerian-led
ECOMOG troops earlier in the year, when the coalition force ousted
from power a military junta with ties to the RUF in February.
	   The West African intervention force fighting under the banner of
the Economic Community of West African States has stayed on in
Sierra Leone to help defend Kabbah's elected government.
	   ECOMOG troops, including fresh reinforcements from Ghana are now
focused on defending the capital, a senior official from Ghana
said.
	   ``We have sent some men and officers to help beef up what is
already on the ground,'' said the senior Ghanaian defense ministry
official who spoke on condition of anonymity.
	   Ghana, a member nation in the ECOWAS bloc, is considering
additional support for the Sierra Leone operation.
	   Nigeria, meanwhile, sent an additional 1,000 soldiers to back up
their positions in Freetown.
	   Diplomats from West Africa, the United States and Britain
meeting Monday in the Ivory Coast called for more aid to help
defend Sierra Leone's embattled government.
	   Nigeria has assumed the vast majority of responsibilities for
ECOMOG, along with Ghana and Guinea. The United States and Britain
have provided logistical support for the regional task force.
	   Rebel units, however, claim to have closed to within 20
kilometers (12 miles) of the capital and have threatened to start
shelling the city.
	   Banya said mercenaries from Liberia, Burkina Faso and the
Ukraine were fighting alongside the rebels. That claim could not be
independently confirmed.
	   ``The rebels must cease fighting immediately, lay down their
arms and accept President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah's government as the
sole legitimate government,'' the ECOWAS statement said.

	   BORMIO, Italy (AP) _ Nicolas Burtin hurt his right knee in a
high-speed spill during Tuesday's World Cup downhill race here,
continuing a streak of injuries and misfortune dogging the French
men's team this season.
	   Burtin fell and crashed into the safety nets, twisting his knee,
at the Orso corner, in the upper part of the icy and twisty Stelvio
course.
	   Team officials said Burtin will undergo medical examinations in
France Wednesday to determine the extent of the injury.
	   The 26-year-old French skier, winner of a World Cup downhill
last season, already had suffered a bad knee injury _ a torn
ligament _ at the same Italian track two years ago.
	   Three other French downhillers, including Olympic champion
Jean-Luc Cretier, suffered season ending knee injuries in the two
previous World Cup downhills at Val Gardena earlier this month.

OAU calls for concerted action to combat scourges of terrorism
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia (AP) _ International action is needed to
combat the scourge of terrorism, the head of the Organization of
African Unity has warned, citing the U.S. embassy bombings earlier
this year that killed 224 people.
	   The bombings of the embassies in Kenya and Tanzania ``remind us
of the need for a decisive and concerted international response,''
Secretary-General Salim Ahmed Salim said Monday.
	   In his New Year's message, the leader of the 52-nation group
also said 1998 was ``a very difficult and turbulent'' year for
Africa with conflicts and civil strife raging in 11 member states,
including Sierra Leone and the Democratic Republic of Congo.
	   Despite the surge of violence, a number of African countries
registered gains in gross domestic product and per capita income,
Salim said. In many countries, the private sector had emerged as a
more potent economic force, he noted.
	   ``This trend needs to be further encouraged in order to
compliment the role of the state in promoting socio-economic
development,'' Salim said.
	   Two hundred and twelve Africans and 12 Americans were killed in
the Aug. 7 bombings of the embassies in Nairobi and the Tanzanian
capital, Dar es Salaam. Nearly 5,500 people were also injured.
	   Earlier this month, the U.S. State Department offered a dlrs 5
million reward for information leading to the capture of each of
the five fugitives accused of helping set up the Tanzania bombing.
Thirteen people have been publicly named as defendants in the
attack.
	   The United States has accused exiled Saudi millionaire Osama bin
Laden of masterminding the attack. A dlrs 5 million reward also has
been offered for his capture.
	   Salim said despite setbacks, the organization would continue to
promote human rights, good governance and the culture of democracy
in the continent.
	   ``I do recognize that these efforts at inculcating a culture of
peace, tolerance and democracy in our societies are still fragile,
but what is encouraging is that there is an ardent desire and
determination to sustain and strengthen them,'' he said.

More international verifiers arriving, NATO warns warring sides
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds; UPDATES with KLA spokesman statement, two bodies found in
northern Kosovo
 &UR; By MISHA SAVIC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) - About 100 international observers
were en route Tuesday to Kosovo to shore up efforts to minimize
fighting in the ethnic-Albanian majority Serbian province amid new
NATO warnings of possible intervention.
	   Their arrival will boost the Kosovo verification mission to
about 700 people, with the envisaged total of 2,000 expected to be
reached by mid-January, said Sandy Blyth, a spokesman for the
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which runs the
operation.
	   The arrivals follow violence last week in the north of the
province that further frayed a shaky de-facto truce established in
October. Authorities seeking to banish a threatened NATO strike
then agreed to end a months-long crackdown on Kosovo's ethnic
Albanians that left hundreds dead and hundreds of thousands _ most
of them ethnic Albanians _ on the run.
	   Reacting to the recent upsurge, NATO said from its headquarters
in Brussels, Belgium, on Tuesday that it remained ``ready to
intervene'' if violence intensifies in the province and demanded
both sides respect the informal cease fire.
	   KLA spokesman Adem Demaci told reporters in Pristina that the
guerrillas will respect the cease-fire ``but we will defend
ourselves with all means if necessary.''
	   Two bodies were found Tuesday morning under a bridge on the road
leading north from the province's capital Pristina, close to the
town of Kosovska Mitrovica. Police were trying to identify the two
frozen corpses.
	   The Kosovo Information Center, run by the pro-independence
Kosovo Albanian leadership reported some overnight shooting on the
outskirts of Kosovska Mitrovica which ``made the situation there
very tense and difficult.''
	   In the wake of the recent fighting, Serbs from the region most
affected demanded protection from Slobodan Milosevic, president of
Yugoslavia, of which Serbia is the main republic. In an open
letter, made public in Belgrade, they said they don't want to
continue being victims of ethnic Albanian guerrillas seeking the
province's independence.
	   The Serbs, from the northern Podujevo region, said this was
their last ``desperate'' appeal to the Yugoslav authorities before
they pack up and flee Kosovo because of ``the terror'' of ethnic
Albanian guerrillas who hold much of the region in their hands.
	   ``We demand that you use all available means to protect our
lives and territory,'' the letter said. ``If you are not ready to
help us, tell us loud and clear so we don't keep on dying in
vain.''
	   The fighting began on the Christmas Eve and lasted for four
days, resulting in 15 deaths, dozens of wounded and at least 5,000
displaced people.
	   Serbs, a tiny minority in the Podujevo region, said that 13
Serbs still are unaccounted for after the fighting. They said they
evacuated some 200 of their children from the region, where ethnic
Albanian guerrillas continue patrols.
	   Blyth said Kosovo Tuesday was ``reasonably quiet ... although
there are still areas which are tense.''
	   He said Italians, Finns, Germans, Swedes, Turks, Americans,
Britons, Canadians, Russians, Spaniards, Norwegians, French,
Estonians and a Lithuanian were in the latest group of observers.

Suharto's second son questioned over charitable foundation
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with remarks from Suharto's son, lawyer in grafs 6-8

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ State prosecutors on Tuesday
questioned a son of ex-President Suharto as part of a corruption
investigation of the former authoritarian leader.
	   President B.J. Habibie ordered the investigation of his
predecessor and onetime mentor after coming under pressure from
student protesters who want Suharto be put on trial. Suharto quit
in May after riots and protests against his 32-year rule.
	   Prosecutors have been scrutinizing seven charitable foundations
owned by Suharto that were allegedly used in part to collect money
that his family used for its own benefit.
	   Suharto, who denies any wrongdoing, has since handed control of
the foundations to the government.
	   One of Suharto's three sons, businessman Bambang Trihatmodjo,
was questioned about his activities as chairman of one of the
foundations, Dana Sejahtera Mandiri.
	   Speaking to reporters after the three-hour questioning, Bambang
said the foundation has provided funds ``for social needs.'' He
answered ``nothing'' when asked whether the fund has also given
money for private companies.
	   The foundation, formed Jan. 15, 1996, has collected 1.9 trillion
rupiahs (dlrs 253 million), of which, one trillion rupiahs (dlrs
133 million) had been spent, said Juan Felix Tampubolon, a lawyer
for Suharto's family who accompanied Bambang during the
interrogation. He did not elaborate.
	   The funds came from the founders, contributions from tax payers,
the government and also from interest earned on its deposits. News
reports said the foundation has 1.3 trillion (dlrs 173 million) in
cash.
	   While critics maintain the probe is largely cosmetic, Attorney
General Andi Mohamad Ghalib has said Suharto might be named a
suspect, a legal move that would bring him a step closer to trial.
	   Also under scrutiny are a national car project run by another of
Suharto's son with huge tax breaks and presidential decrees that
allegedly benefited the former president's family and friends.
	   Prosecutors in the Suharto investigation are expected to finish
their questioning of witnesses early next year.
	   Suharto, whose authority was eroded by his failure to revive
Indonesia's shattered economy, has been accused of using his
position and connections to help his six children build huge
business empires.
	   The Indonesian Observer on Tuesday reported that Suharto and his
family own concessions to almost 9 million hectares (22,230,000
acres) of forest land in Indonesia as well as 205,000 hectares
(506,000 acres) of prime real estate.
	   The newspaper quoted Land Affairs Minister Hasan Basri Durin as
saying the land is owned by companies in which the Suharto clan
controls at least 80 percent of the shares.

Report: Russia's oil production to total 303.5 million tons in
</HEADLINE>
1998 &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia produced an estimated 303.5 million metric
tons of oil in 1998, and exported 134 million metric tons, the Fuel
and Energy Ministry said Tuesday.
	   Oil exports are Russia's main revenue earner, and the
cash-strapped government has been trying to keep up exports,
despite the slide of world oil prices.
	   This year's exports will mark a 6.3-percent increase from 1997,
the Fuel and Energy Ministry said, according to the Interfax news
agency. But revenues were down considerably, officials have said.
	   Next year, Russia is expected to produce between 284 million
metric tons and 296 million metric tons of oil _ down nearly 5
percent from 1998, the ministry said.
	   Russia will export between 108 million metric tons and 120
million metric tons of oil next year, it said.

Report: Police sergeant and seven others charged with match fixing
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Hong Kong's top anti-corruption agency on
Tuesday charged a police sergeant and seven others with fixing
soccer matches, government radio reported.
	   The police sergeant was also charged by the Independent
Commission Against Corruption for allegedly offering bribes to a
police superintendent and a chief inspector in return for
information on raids on bookmaking centers, Hong Kong Radio
reported.
	   The unidentified police sergeant allegedly offered up to 100,000
Hong Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs 12,820) each to the police officers,
it added.
	   All defendants were charged with operating an illegal bookmaking
center in Hong Kong to fix local and international matches from
June last year to June this year, the report added.
	   The defendants, including an assistant bank manager and four
unemployed men, were ordered to enter pleas in court next month.
Their names were not given.
	   The case followed an earlier ICAC investigation which resulted
in the prosecution of six professional players for fixing matches,
including a World Cup qualifying match against Thailand last year.
	   Top player Chan Tsz-kong was jailed for one year in July on the
match-fixing charges after he pleaded guilty to accepting 80,000
Hong Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs 10,256) in exchange for giving up two
goals against Thailand.

Twenty-nine illegal immigrants found in a van
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) _ Twenty-nine illegal immigrants
from Iraq and Afghanistan were found hidden in a van Monday during
a routine traffic control, the news agency CTK reported Tuesday.
	   The agency quoted police spokeswoman Dagmar Bartonikova as
saying that driver of the van escaped when police stopped the car
and was not yet detained.
	   Bartonikova said that the refugees asked for political asylum
and were placed in a refugee camp.
	   The Czech Republic is becoming a popular transit destination for
refugees.
	   More than 33,000 illegal immigrants have been caught in the
Czech Republic this year, but only a fraction have asked for
asylum, as the final hoped-for destination for most of them is
Germany.

<TEXT>
	   COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) _ A Swedish priest was sentenced to 30
days in jail on Tuesday after admitting he attempted to smuggle two
men into Denmark.
	   The 62-year-old Lutheran priest, whose identity was not publicly
disclosed, was arrested late Monday in Nakskov, southern Denmark,
upon arrival from Germany by ferry. During a random check, police
found the men, who were believed to be from Iraq, hidden in his car
trunk.
	   The priest told the court in the town of Maribo that his motives
were humanitarian. He picked up the men in Austria and Germany,
Danish radio reported.
	   The court banned him from entering Denmark for the next five
years.
	   The two refugees likely would be returned to Germany.

More international verifiers arriving in Kosovo; NATO warns warring

 &UR; Eds: Recasts, UPDATES with statement from KLA, two bodies found in
northern Kosovo &QL; 
 &UR; By MISHA SAVIC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ About 100 international observers
were heading Tuesday to Kosovo in efforts to curb fighting in the
ethnic-Albanian majority Serbian province while NATO reiterated
warnings of possible intervention.
	   The observers' arrival will boost the Kosovo monitoring mission
to about 700 people, with the envisaged total of 2,000 expected to
be reached by mid-January, said Sandy Blyth, a spokesman for the
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which runs the
operation.
	   The arrivals follow violence last week in the north of the
province that further frayed a shaky de-facto truce established in
October. Authorities seeking to avert a threatened NATO strike then
agreed to end a months-long crackdown on Kosovo's separatist-minded
ethnic Albanians.
	   The months of violence left hundreds dead and hundreds of
thousands _ most of them ethnic Albanians _ on the run in Kosovo, a
province of the dominant Yugoslavian republic of Serbia.
	   Reacting to the recent upsurge, NATO said Tuesday from its
headquarters in Brussels, Belgium, that it remained ``ready to
intervene'' if violence intensifies in the province and demanded
that both sides respect the informal cease fire.
	   KLA spokesman Adem Demaci told reporters in Pristina that the
guerrillas will respect the cease-fire ``but we will defend
ourselves with all means if necessary.''
	   Two bodies were found Tuesday morning under a bridge on the road
leading north from the province's capital Pristina, close to the
town of Kosovska Mitrovica. Police were trying to identify the two
frozen corpses.
	   The Kosovo Information Center, run by the pro-independence
Kosovo Albanian leadership reported some overnight shooting on the
outskirts of Kosovska Mitrovica which ``made the situation there
very tense and difficult.''
	   In the wake of the recent fighting, Serbs from the region most
affected demanded protection from Yugoslavian President Slobodan
Milosevic. In an open letter, made public in Belgrade, they said
they don't want to continue being victims of ethnic Albanian
guerrillas seeking the province's independence.
	   The Serbs, from the northern Podujevo region, said this was
their last ``desperate'' appeal to the Yugoslav authorities before
they pack up and flee Kosovo because of ``the terror'' of ethnic
Albanian guerrillas who control much of the region.
	   ``We demand that you use all available means to protect our
lives and territory,'' the letter said. ``If you are not ready to
help us, tell us loud and clear so we don't keep on dying in
vain.''
	   The most recent fighting began on Christmas Eve and lasted four
days, killing 15 people, wounding dozens and displacing at least
5,000.
	   Serbs, a tiny minority in the Podujevo region, said that 13
Serbs remained missing after the fighting. They said they evacuated
some 200 of their children from the region, where ethnic Albanian
guerrillas continue patrols.
	   Blyth said Tuesday that Kosovo was ``reasonably quiet ...
although there are still areas which are tense.''
	   He said Italians, Finns, Germans, Swedes, Turks, Americans,
Britons, Canadians, Russians, Spaniards, Norwegians, French,
Estonians and a Lithuanian were in the latest group of observers.

<TEXT>
	   DURBAN, South Africa (AP) _ South Africa crushed the West Indies
by nine wickets to win the third test 75 minutes after lunch of the
fourth day at Kingsmead Tuesday.
	   The win gave them an unbeatable 3-0 lead in the five match
series.
	   West Indies failed in its batting performance _ the one area
where they could have saved the match.
	   But South African batsmen improved immensely, making it possible
for their bowling attack to twice inflict major collapses on the
brittle Caribbean line-up.
	   For two hours on Monday, with a seemingly unstoppable Brian Lara
and Shivnarine Chanderpaul, it seemed the West Indies had found
their feet and could win in Durban to keep the series alive.
	   But the brilliant catching of Herschelle Gibbs stopped Lara at
79, providing the downward turning point for the visitors. A
calamitous six wickets fell between tea and an early close on
Monday.
	   South Africa pushed ruthlessly for victory on Tuesday.
	   Guiding the home team to safety at the close were Gary Kirsten
on a really well-struck undefeated 71 and Jacques Kallis on 23.
Gibbs had been removed just one run short of his second test 50 by
Carl Hooper, who trapped him in front.
	   South Africa was already on the brink of clinching the series at
lunch time, holding at 75 without loss. The tourists were all out
for 259, putting them just 145 ahead.
	   Shaun Pollock moved to his third five-wicket haul of the series
as he dismissed Curtly Ambrose for five. Allan Donald bowled
Courtney Walsh for three.
	   South Africa started steadily and gradually increased the pace,
with Gary Kirsten undefeated on 40 and Herschelle Gibbs on 32.
	   Both looked unperturbed by anything the West Indies bowlers had
to offer, although Gibbs played a rash shot three balls and was
dropped off a skied pull shot by wicketkeeper Ridley Jacobs off the
bowling of Rawl Lewis.
	   West Indies received another blow before lunch when Walsh
damaged his hamstring running to cut off a ball in the field. It
appears his participation in the next Test is in doubt.
	   The next match takes place at Newlands in Cape Town on Jan. 2.

Sarajevo cabdrivers block city after the murder of a colleague
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By AIDA CERKEZ-ROBINSON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ Over 1,000 people, most of
them Sarajevo cab drivers, blocked the downtown streets of the
Bosnian capital Tuesday in a protest prompted by the murder of
their colleague.
	   Muslim cabdriver Denis Imamovic, 22, went missing Sunday night
after three men were seen entering his car. After a joint search of
cabdrivers in the city as well as from Bosnian Serb territory, his
body was found a few kilometers (miles) away from Sarajevo, in a
pit next to the road that connects the capital with the wartime
Bosnian Serb stronghold of Pale.
	   As the news about the murder spread through the taxi radio
system, more then 300 cab drivers from Sarajevo drove to the spot
where Imamovic was found.
	   But the drivers said that three people in a Bosnian Serb police
car fired at them as they arrived at the scene. Some of the
cabdrivers told the Sarajevo daily Dnevni Avaz that they recognized
the Pale police chief among those who fired and that they were told
that Imamovic's car was seen that morning in front of the Pale
police station.
	   Car theft appeared to be the motive, just like in three other
previous killings of cabbies, that occurred since 1996, when the
city opened up after the years-long Bosnian Serb siege. The bodies
of all three other victims were also found in Bosnian Serb
territory.
	   Within hours after the shooting incident, more than 1,000 angry
Sarajevo taxi drivers blocked roads into the city for several
hours, demanding police from both entities to jointly control
Sarajevo's entry points.
	   U.N. spokeswoman Frederike Seidel, confirmed the body of the
victim was found.
	   Seidel said some of the demonstrators mobbed a U.N. vehicle
damaging the car. Local police escorted the vehicle to safety
without anybody being injured, she said.
	   Seidel was unaware of the cabbies' demands for police
checkpoints.
	   Such checkpoints are forbidden by the Dayton Peace Agreement of
1995, which ended the 3 1/2 year long war. The aim was to encourage
freedom of movement between the Muslim-Croat and the Bosnian Serb
halves of the country.
	   Cab drivers said Tuesday they want at least police checks of the
identity of their passengers when they cross over to Bosnian Serb
territory.

Report: fugitive Indonesian businessman working in China
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with official reaction, grafs 3-4; single name for
Justice Minister Muladi is correct

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ An Indonesian businessman who escaped
from jail in 1996 after being convicted of fraud is running a
successful brewery in China, local media reported Tuesday.
	   Eddy Tansil, who was sentenced to 20 years in prison in one of
Indonesia's biggest financial scandals, has business ties to
Germany's Beck's Beer Co., a watchdog group said.
	   Minister of Justice Muladi said the government has asked its
embassy in Beijing to check the validity of the report.
	   If true, Indonesia will ask Beijing to extradite Tansil, Muladi
told the state-run TVRI television station. ``There is no
extradition agreement (between Jakarta and Beijing) but we are
arranging for that,'' he said.
	   Tansil is owner of Putian Golden Key Brewery Co. in the Chinese
city of Putian in Fujian province, newspapers quoted the Gempita
group as saying.
	   Gempita is the acronym in the Indonesian language for Movement
of Concerned Citizens to Save State Assets.
	   Established in 1992, Putian Golden Key is now a major player in
China's premium beer market and is worth dlrs 10 million, Gempita
chairman Albert Hasibuan said. It allegedly has a licensing
agreement with Beck's Beers.
	   Tansil was convicted in 1994 of defrauding the government of
dlrs 430 million in a case that became a symbol of official
corruption in Indonesia.
	   Prosecutors said he obtained the money as a loan after bribing
officials of state-owned Bank Pembangunan Indonesia, or Bapindo.
	   Tansil said he would use the loan to build a petrochemicals
factory, but then pocketed part or all of the money. The factory
was never completed.
	   Two former Cabinet ministers were questioned in court, but never
indicted.
	   After serving two years of his sentence, Tansil escaped from
jail after bribing jail officials and eluded a nationwide manhunt.
	   Gempita said Tansil has not changed his name since his arrest
and is known in China as ``Mr. E.T.''
	   Widespread allegations of official corruption helped erode the
credibility of former President Suharto, who quit in May after
riots and protests against his rule.
	   Much of the rioting by Indonesia's poor was directed at the
homes and shops of ethnic Chinese because of their relative wealth
and perceived links to corrupt government officials.

	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraq is challenging the no-fly zones
patrolled by the United States and Britain by flying its warplanes
there, Vice President Taha Yassin Ramadan said Tuesday.
	   The move came a day after U.S. aircraft fired on an
anti-aircraft battery in the northern no-fly zone. Iraq says four
soldiers were killed.
	   Asked if Iraq was flying its own aircraft in the no-fly zones,
Ramadan said: ``We are doing it right now.''
	   ``Iraqi planes in effect are flying in a normal manner in Iraqi
air space,'' he told Associated Press Television News.

that violates its airspace.
	   ``Our resistance will continue against any penetration,'' he
said. ``The war is still on.''
	   The United States says its planes fired Monday in self-defense
after coming under Iraqi missile attack.
	   The United States and its allies set up the no-fly zones in
northern and southern Iraq to protect Kurdish and Shiite rebels
from Saddam's forces.

U.S. businessman charged with channeling money to Hamas
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIT EL, West Bank (AP) - An Israeli military court on Tuesday
charged a Palestinian American businessman with funneling money to
the Islamic militant group Hamas.
	   The court said the money went to Adel Awadallah, a top Hamas
fugitive and mastermind of suicide bombings in Israel. Awadallah
was killed in an Israeli commando raid in September.
	   The defendant, Jamil Sarsour, denied any connection to Hamas.
``I only made a small contribution to the family (of Awadallah),
that's all I did,'' Sarsour, a resident of the West Bank town of
Ramallah, said on Israel army radio.
	   Sarsour's hometown in the United States was no immediately
available.
	   The indictment said Sarsour channeled funds to Hamas from the
United States, using an Israeli bank account. The money was cashed
by a 70-year-old woman and was transferred to Awadallah.
	   Awadallah also asked Sarsour to get him a false passport or any
other identification that would enable him to flee the country.
	   ``From the investigation it became clear that Awadallah felt the
ring tighten around him,'' the military prosecutor, Sgt. Eli Baon,
said on the radio.
	   Sarsour did not get Awadallah a passport, but did provide him
with other false papers, the radio said.
	   The military court spokesman was not immediately available for
comment.

Poll indicates support slipping for Hong Kong leader
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Public support for Hong Kong's leader, Tung
Chee-hwa, has slipped to its lowest level since he took over after
the former British colony reverted to Chinese rule last July,
according to an opinion poll released Tuesday.
	   Tung's support rating fell to an average 57.6 points for 1998,
down from an average of 62.3 points last year, according to Hong
Kong University's Social Science Research Center
	   The poll was conducted through telephone interviews of more than
500 people every two weeks. It had a margin of error of 1 point, or
2 percent.
	   Tung, a former shipping magnate, took over as Chief Executive on
July 1 after the departure of Hong Kong's last British governor,
Chris Patten.
	   Tung has increasingly come under fire for not doing enough to
help Hong Kong out of its protracted economic recession.
	   Late Tuesday, the government announced that gross domestic
product fell by 7.1 percent for the three months ending Sept. 30.
Hong Kong showed its worst quarterly economic performance since
1973, the first year when officials began measuring such
statistics.

	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraq is challenging the no-fly zones
patrolled by the United States and Britain by flying its warplanes
there, Vice President Taha Yassin Ramadan said Tuesday.
	   The move came a day after U.S. aircraft fired on an
anti-aircraft battery in the northern no-fly zone. Iraq says four
soldiers were killed.
	   Asked if Iraq was flying its own aircraft in the no-fly zones,
Ramadan said: ``We are doing it right now.''
	   ``Iraqi planes in effect are flying in a normal manner in Iraqi
air space,'' he told Associated Press Television News.

Defense chief: Russia can build new heavy nuclear missile if
</HEADLINE>
needed &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with official's comments in new grafs 4-7. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Despite severe economic problems, Russia is still
strong enough to develop a new nuclear missile if necessary,
Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev said in an interview published
Tuesday.
	   ``The talk about our weakness is an overstatement,'' Sergeyev
said in an interview published in the daily Segodnya. ``If we need,
we may build a heavy missile.''
	   Sergeyev was responding to a question about what the military
would do if Russia's parliament does not ratify the START II arms
reduction treaty, under which Russia and the United States are to
reduce their nuclear forces.
	   Another senior government official, First Deputy Prime Minister
Yuri Maslyukov, appeared to have a different view of the Russian
capacity.
	   In current economic conditions, Russia can't ``even try to match
the U.S. nuclear missile potential,'' Maslyukov said on Tuesday,
according to the Interfax news agency.
	   He called on the Russian parlament to quickly ratify START II,
saying that the deployment of new Topol-M missiles would allow
Russia to preserve an effective nuclear deterrent. The first 10
Topol-Ms were put on duty last weekend.
	   Russia should mobilize its resources to build up to 30 such
missiles a year, Maslyukov said.
	   Sergeyev and other military leaders have also strongly supported
the treaty, saying that by the year 2007, the START II's deadline
for halving Russian and U.S. arsenals to 3,000-3,500 warheads each,
Russia's aging heavy missiles will have to be decommissioned
anyway.
	   Sergeyev appeared to reiterate his support for the treaty on
Tuesday, but said Moscow can maintain a credible nuclear force and
develop new missiles if necessary.
	   ``Why should we go back to the past? The number of warheads
doesn't determine anything,'' he said.
	   Russia and the United States signed START II in 1993, and the
U.S. Senate approved it in 1996. The Communist-dominated Russian
parliament has delayed ratification, claiming the treaty would
damage Russia's security.
	   Lawmakers appeared ready to approve the treaty earlier this
month, but again delayed ratification until next spring to protest
U.S. and British air strikes against Iraq.
	   Sergeyev and other government officials have condemned the
strikes on Iraq.
	   ``We aren't going to have a confrontation with America,''
Sergeyev said in the interview. ``But we couldn't keep quiet, since
that (raids on Iraq) was a step away from law and toward primeval
society.''
	   ``I don't know what our tough stance will bring, but I'm sure
that it will be taken into account. Many are applauding us under
the table,'' he said.

Poll: More Danes want to join euro
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) _ Two days before the new euro currency
goes into effect for 11 European Union members, a growing number of
Danes believe their country should take part, according to a poll
published Tuesday.
	   The survey by the Megaphone polling institute said 54 percent of
the 1,009 people surveyed favor Denmark's participation, while 36
percent oppose that. The remaining 10 percent were undecided.
	   The poll, conducted Dec. 18-22, was broadcast by TV2 channel.
	   Denmark is one of four EU countries staying out of the monetary
union for the time being. After voters in 1992 rejected the
Maastricht treaty that established the system, Denmark won opt-out
clauses. The treaty then was approved.
	   Danish voters traditionally have been lukewarm supporters of the
EU. Although many politicians support the unified currency, they
have been wary about bringing the issue to voters again.
	   A poll published last October showed 46 percent of Danes favored
the single currency, while 44 percent were opposed.
	   It would take another national referendum for Denmark to adopt
the new currency. The government has said it has no plans to hold a
referendum before the year 2001.

Russia calls on United States, Iraq to show ``restraint''
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Reacting to the latest U.S.-Iraq clash, the
Russian Foreign Ministry on Tuesday called on both sides to show
``restraint'' but stopped short of condemning the U.S. action.
	   ``It's necessary to show common sense and composure in order to
overcome the crisis,'' Foreign Ministry spokesman Vladimir
Rakhmanin said at a briefing.
	   On Monday, U.S. warplanes fired missiles and precision-guided
bombs to strike an anti-aircraft site in northern Iraq that
launched three missiles at U.S. jets on patrol, the Pentagon said.
Iraq reported four soldiers killed.
	   The Pentagon says U.S. and British patrols in the ``no-fly''
zones over Iraq will continue in an atmosphere of increased tension
after the incident.
	   Rakhmanin said that the creation of ``no-fly'' zones hadn't been
authorized by the United Nations, but he steered clear of direct
criticism of the U.S. action.
	   Moscow denounced U.S. and British air raids against Iraq earlier
this month in harsh rhetoric reminiscent of the Cold War and
briefly recalled its ambassadors to Washington and London. Russian
officials have since changed their tone, stressing they want to
have good relations with the United States and Britain.
	   Moscow, which is owed billions of dollars by Iraq, has pushed
for the early lifting of the U.N. sanctions against Iraq while
urging its long-time ally to comply with the U.N. resolutions.

	   Ramadan also said that Iraq will continue firing at any aircraft
that intrudes on Iraqi airspace.

said. ``The war is still on.''

China sends two exiled dissidents to labor camps
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: INCORPORATES material from China-Dissidents sent earlier;
UPDATES with journalist moved to another prison in grafs 19-21

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Two U.S.-based Chinese dissidents who sneaked
back into China were caught by police and sentenced without trial
to three years of forced labor, China's Foreign Ministry said
Tuesday.
	   In the first official word on the whereabouts of Zhang Lin and
Wei Quanbao since they slipped into China seven weeks ago, the
ministry said police arrested them Nov. 12 in the southern city of
Guangzhou in a barber shop operating as a brothel.
	   The ministry said the two men confessed to hiring prostitutes
and evading border police by hiding inside a truck from Hong Kong
on Nov. 11. For those alleged crimes, police sentenced both to
three years of ``labor reeducation'' _ the maximum sentence police
can order without a trial.
	   Members of the men's families asked the Chinese Consulate in New
York on Monday to help locate the pair, but consular officials were
evasive, according to Chinese dissidents in New York.
	   Meanwhile, in a letter penned in handcuffs from prison, another
dissident defiantly protested as ``political persecution'' his
13-year sentence for trying to form an opposition party.
	   Xu Wenli said he would not appeal his sentence out of contempt
for the judicial system that prosecuted him last week.
	   ``My so-called open trial was in truth nothing but a means of
political persecution,'' Xu wrote in the letter, dated Monday and
made available to foreign news organizations.
	   ``First, I will not answer any questions. Second, I will not
defend myself. Third, I will not appeal to a higher court. This is
a silent protest against political persecution.''
	   Xu is among four dissidents tried and given lengthy sentences in
the past two weeks in China's harshest crackdown on political
dissent in two years.
	   Xu, Qin Yongmin and Wang Youcai were sentenced to 13, 12 and 11
years respectively for trying to organize the China Democracy
Party. Labor rights campaigner Zhang Shanguang was sentenced to 10
years Sunday for telling U.S. government-funded Radio Free Asia
about a farmers protest.
	   Xu is the oldest and most experienced campaigner of the four.
His prison protest accused Communist Party leaders of protecting
their vested interests by using China's legal system to defend
one-party rule.
	   ``Pluralism in the political sphere is historically inevitable.
No individual or political party can prevent this,'' Xu wrote.
	   ``History will judge us fairly,'' wrote Xu, who earlier spent 12
years in prison, much of it in solitary confinement.
	   His statement ended with the words ``penned in handcuffs'' and
instructions to his lawyer to deliver copies to his wife and court
authorities.
	   In its statement, the Foreign Ministry identified Zhang and Wei
as members of another party, the China Democratic Justice Party. It
called the group a ``hostile foreign organization'' and said the
two men ``engaged in activities to oppose the Chinese government
while in the United States.''
	   The party, set up to unite dissidents overseas and in China,
claimed earlier this year to have 100 members in as many as 10
branches in China.
	   Zhang, 35, is a veteran democracy and labor rights campaigner.
He served two stints in prisons and labor camps for a total of five
years between 1989 and 1997, and went to the United States after
his sentence ended last year.
	   Wei, 38, went to the United States in 1994. Both reportedly have
U.S. residence permits.
	   Separately, jailed journalist Gao Yu has been moved from a
prison near Beijing to another location, although there are no
signs that she will be granted early release, her husband said
Tuesday.
	   Gao was moved because the Yanqing prison where she was held is
shutting down its women's section, said Zhao Yuankang. He said Gao
has heart problems and sometimes faints. She also has an allergy on
her hands, so ``she can't pick up anything,'' he said.
	   A former deputy editor of an economics weekly, Gao was arrested
Oct. 2, 1993. She was tried in secret and sentenced to six years in
prison for leaking state secrets, apparently for writing about
Communist Party politics for a Hong Kong magazine.

	   The Iraqi defiance is likely to escalate its confrontation with
the United States and Britain, which bombed Iraq for four nights
between Dec. 16 and Dec. 19.
	   The airstrikes were reportedly aimed at diminishing Iraq's
ability to build weapons of mass destruction, which U.N. weapons
inspectors were trying to dismantle until they withdrew on Dec. 16
complaining of Iraqi obstruction.
	   Iraq says 62 soldiers and more than 40 civilians were killed in
the bombardment. Iraq also alleges that many civilian targets were
hit, and not just defense sites as claimed by the United States.
	   Iraq also claimed on Monday that it shot down an ``enemy
plane,'' but U.S. officials said all American planes had returned
safely.
	   The claim appeared in banner headlines in all Baghdad newspapers
Tuesday. ``An enemy plane is shot down and search is under way for
the wreckage and pilot,'' the Babil, owned by President Saddam
Hussein's oldest son, Odai, trumpeted.
	   But commentaries and editorials made no mention of the soldiers
reportedly killed in the U.S. attack.

Netanyahu ally does not rule out bid for prime minister of Israel
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: INCORPORATES BC-Israel-Netanyahu, UPDATES with parliament
committee agreeing on proposed compromise of May 17 as date for
elections. ADDS byline &QL; 
 &UR; By MARK LAVIE &QC;

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ In a new blow to Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu, his closest political ally, Foreign Minister Ariel
Sharon, said he hasn't ruled out running for the premier's post.
	   Parliament's Law Committee on Tuesday approved May 17 as the
date for new elections, more than a year ahead of schedule.
	   Netanyahu faces a growing field of challengers, including
members of his own Likud Party who either seek to wrest the party's
nomination from him or plan to run on their own slate.
	   With five candidates already in the race and popular former
armed forces chief of staff Amnon Shahak expected to announce his
bid next week, it is unlikely the elections will be determined in
the first round. If no candidate wins more than 50 percent, a
runoff will be held June 1.
	   In what looked like his first campaign stop, Netanyahu on
Tuesday prayed at the Western Wall, Judaism's holiest site, and
struck a theme that helped him win in 1996 _ a pledge to keep
Jerusalem united.
	   At the time, Netanyahu accused incumbent Prime Minister Shimon
Peres of making too many concessions to the Palestinians who hope
to set up a future capital in east Jerusalem, the sector Israel
captured from Jordan in the 1967 Mideast war.
	   Netanyahu's campaign used the slogan ``Peres will divide
Jerusalem,'' which was credited with helping the opposition leader
narrowly defeat Peres.
	   At the Wall on Tuesday, Netanyahu said Jews have been struggling
for centuries to regain control over Jerusalem and keep the city
united. ``This is very much the struggle we are engaged in now,''
he said.
	   Sharon's acknowledgment on Monday evening that he was
considering a bid for prime minister came as a surprise.
	   Only on Sunday, he had told Likud's Central Committee that he
did ``not want to be prime minister.'' Less than 24 hours later, he
said on a TV talk show that under certain circumstances, he might
enter the race.
	   ``There is a difference between `I don't want to be prime
minister' and running under special circumstances,'' Sharon said.
	   There was speculation he could enter the race if Netanyahu's
popularity drops or key leaders abandon the Likud party.
	   Sharon, a popular hawk and the most experienced minister in
Netanyahu's Cabinet, did not say whether he would challenge
Netanyahu for Likud Party leadership in January primaries or form
his own slate if he decides to run.
	   Sharon resigned his post as defense minister in 1983 after he
was held indirectly responsible for the massacre of hundreds of
Palestinians during Israel's military offensive to chase PLO
guerrillas out of Lebanon. Later, he served only in second-rank
posts despite his popularity.

China sentences revenge bank robber to death
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ A former postal service employee who killed a
bank assistant while mounting a revenge robbery on a bank was
sentenced to death Tuesday by a Beijing court, official media said.
	   Guo Hui, 20, was dismissed from the postal service in October
for incompetency, the state-run Xinhua News Agency said. The next
month, on Nov. 14, Guo broke into a postal savings bank in Daxing
county, in Beijing's southern suburbs, in revenge, it said.
	   He killed Zhang Li, a female bank assistant, and stole about
5,000 yuan (dlrs 600), Xinhua said.
	   Guo was sentenced to death by the Beijing No.1 Intermediate
People's Court. His girlfriend, 18-year-old Ruan Fang, was
sentenced to three years imprisonment for giving false testimony
and covering up for Gao, it said.

Synchronized diving set for inclusion in 2000 Sydney Games
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Synchronized swimming is an Olympic event, so why
not synchronized diving?
	   Swimming's world governing body (FINA) says synchronized diving
is likely to be included on the program of the 2000 Sydney
Olympics.
	   FINA said that, upon its recommendation, Sydney organizers had
petitioned the International Olympic Committee to accept the
addition of the event.
	   The IOC executive board will announce its decision in March,
FINA said in its latest newsletter.
	   Synchronized diving, recognized since 1995, is now included in
most major international competitions, including the world
championships.
	   The event involves divers plunging into the water side by side
from either the 10-meter platform or from parallel 3-meter
springboards. The divers are judged on individual technical skills
and the ability to coordinate their movements and enter the water
together.

New Basque premier expected to be elected with backing of
</HEADLINE>
ETA-linked party &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   VITORIA, Spain (AP) _ A moderate pro-Basque independence
candidate was Tuesday expected to be elected premier of the new
regional government with the help of deputies linked to the armed
separatist group ETA.
	   Two months after the Basque elections, the 71-seat regional
parliament convened in this northern city to elect its new
lehendakari _ a Basque word for president.
	   The victory of Juan Jose Ibarretxe from the Basque Nationalist
Party, the largest single party with 21 seats, was being treated by
Spanish media as a forgone conclusion, although the electoral
debate was scheduled into the night.
	   Ibarretxe's election would follow a pact signed Saturday between
his party and the minority Euskal Alkartasuna aimed at establishing
the first entirely pro-independence coalition government since the
region gained autonomous status in 1979, following the death of
dictator Gen. Francisco Franco.
	   But Ibarretxe's election, and the pact's survival, also requires
the support of the radical pro-independence grouping Euskal
Herritarrok that is dominated by Herri Batasuna _ long recognized
as ETA's political wing.
	   With the debate well underway, Euskal Herritarrok's 14 deputies
had not openly declared their voting intentions.
	   Ibarretxe centered his address on the fledgling Basque peace
process founded in ETA's observance of an unlimited cease-fire
since September, and the conservative government of Prime Minister
Jose Maria Aznar's gradual softening of its anti-negotiation
stance.
	   ``We are all Basques, we all have responsibility and we must
also all participate in the construction of peace,'' Ibarretxe told
the Basque parliament.
	   ``Dialogue without exclusion and without conditions and with
respect for the decisions taken by Basques is the key, and nothing
else,'' Ibarretxe said referring to a peace plan signed by Basque
nationalists just before ETA called its truce.
	   Known as the Estella Pact, the plan foresees cross-party
negotiations on the status of the Basque region running parallel
with disarmament talks between the government and ETA.
	   But the Estella Pact was slammed by Carlos Iturgaiz, the only
other candidate for lehendakari, as an ``imposition'' of
pro-independence parties. Iturgaiz heads the Basque branch of
Aznar's Popular Party that rejects any change in the status of the
Basque region.
	   The candidate also said that the treat of violence remained and
needed to be ``combated'', despite ETA's truce.
	   Popular Party politicians were ETA's favored targets in the
months prior to the cease-fire, and Iturgaiz has been consistently
suspicious of the slow move towards possible peace negotiations
since the group's cease-fire.
	   ETA has killed nearly 800 people since beginning its violent
campaign for an independent Basque homeland straddling parts of
northern Spain and southern France in 1968.

Mogadishu greets its first police force in eight years
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By AHMED ABDI NUR &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOGADISHU, Somalia (AP) _ Somalis weary of eight years of
anarchy in their capital city on Tuesday cheered the first public
appearance of 2,100 policemen, outfitted and paid for by Libya.
	   The new cops marched in their crisp khaki uniforms across the
October 21 parade grounds that had been decorated with flowers,
ribbons and a banner declaring ``we finally have law and security''
as warlords and Egyptian and Libyan diplomats looked on.
	   The Somali flag _ a single white star on a skyblue background _
flapped in the breeze, the symbol of the state that collapsed nine
years ago.
	   Police commander Col. Abdi Hassan Awaleh Qeybdid said the force
would soon patrol Mogadishu's streets to enforce a return to
stability in the capital and to permit the reopening of the city's
airport and seaport. Both have been closed because of factional
fighting over access and tax revenue since the ill-fated U.N.
peacekeeping mission to Somalia withdrew in March 1995.
	   The police parade included 63 ``technicals'' _ pick-up trucks
mounted with machine guns _ transformed into police vehicles by
coats of dark blue paint.
	   In October, north Mogadishu faction leader Ali Mahdi Mohamed and
south Mogadishu leader Hussein Mohamed Aidid agreed, with Libyan
help, to set up a joint administration in the capital.
	   On Tuesday, Ali Mahdi called on capital residents to cooperate
with the new police force in identifying bandits and looters, often
rogue militiamen and minor warlords who, fearful of losing out on
the benefits of the joint administration, have taken to extortion
and kidnapping to obtain funds.
	   Several faction leaders opposed to the Ali Mahdi-Aidid alliance
have assembled hundreds of armed militiamen and gun-mounted trucks
known as ``battle wagons'' in areas of the capital under their
control.
	   In south Mogadishu, four Islamic courts have set up a common
leadership and established their own fighting force to combat
banditry in the capital.
	   ``Now is the time to forgive each other and forget about the
past,'' Ali Mahdi said at the graduation ceremony.
	   He added, however, that those ``opposing the common good of the
people,'' would be apprehended.
	   Somalia has been without a central government since 1991, when
rival warlords Ali Mahdi and Aidid's late father, Gen. Mohammed
Farah Aidid, joined forces to oust dictator Mohamed Siad Barre and
then turned on each other for control.

<TEXT>
	   The Iraqi defiance is likely to escalate its confrontation with
the United States and Britain, which bombed Iraq for four nights
from Dec. 16 to Dec. 19.
	   The United States said the strikes were aimed at diminishing
Iraq's ability to build weapons of mass destruction, which U.N.
weapons inspectors were trying to dismantle until they withdrew on
Dec. 16 complaining of Iraqi obstruction.
	   Iraq says 62 soldiers and more than 40 civilians were killed in
the bombardment. Iraq also alleges that many civilian targets were
hit, and not just defense sites as claimed by the United States.
	   Iraq also claimed on Monday that it shot down an ``enemy
plane,'' but U.S. officials said all American planes had returned
safely.
	   The claim appeared in banner headlines in all Baghdad newspapers
Tuesday. ``An enemy plane is shot down and search is under way for
the wreckage and pilot,'' the Babil, owned by President Saddam
Hussein's oldest son, Odai, trumpeted.

	   Ramadan said ``the so-called air exclusion zones exist only in
the sick imagination of the British and American administrations.''
	   The new challenge over the no-fly zone comes as Iraq is trying
to boost its support in the Arab world, where there is widespread
sympathy for Iraqi civilians suffering U.N. economic sanctions
imposed after Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
	   Iraqi newspapers on Tuesday hailed widespread public protests in
Arab capitals against the U.S.-British airstrikes and criticized
Arab governments, which have voiced little opposition to the
bombardment.
	   Under U.N. resolutions, the sanctions cannot be lifted until
U.N. weapons inspectors certify that Iraq is free of nuclear,
chemical and biological weapons along with long-range missiles.
	   Arab leaders must either support Iraq or risk the ``wrath'' of
the Arab masses, the newspapers said, commenting on the Arab
League's failure to convene a proposed meeting of Arab foreign
ministers to discuss and condemn the bombardment.
	   In a front-page editorial, Iraq's al-Qadissiya newspaper warned
Arab leaders that ignoring ``the snowballing Arab wrath ... will
shake the ground from under their feet.''
	   Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, in one of his most forthright
comments on the crisis, said in an interview published Monday that
Saddam's rule was responsible for his country's woes.
	   ``The ruling regime (in Iraq) is the reason for all the problems
... and Egypt naturally does not support this regime,'' Mubarak was
quoted as saying by the al-Gomhuriya, an Egyptian government-owned
newspaper.
	   Mubarak, a close U.S. ally, also said that it was he who
persuaded U.S. President Bill Clinton to halt the bombardment,
whose stated aim was to diminish Iraq's ability to build weapons of
mass destruction.
	   Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz responded to Mubarak with
harsh words in an editorial he wrote for Tuesday's al-Jumhouriya,
an Iraqi government-owned newspaper.
	   ``President Mubarak assumes a role for himself which both
Washington and London have not given to him,'' Aziz wrote in the
front-page editorial.
	   ``In reality there is no noble, fair and intelligent person in
Egypt, in the Arab homeland or the whole world sharing Mr. Mubarak
in his deduction,'' Aziz wrote.
	   He said that in reality Mubarak called for a halt to the strikes
because he feared the anger in the Egyptian and Arab streets.

	   --
	   MBABANE, Swaziland (AP) _ Swaziland's opposition groups blasted
new laws giving local chiefs near dictatorial powers, saying they
were an invitation to conflict, South African television reported.
	   The legislation, enacted by one of the world's last remaining
absolute monarchs King Mswati III, gives the chiefs the power to
arrest and try their subjects, SABC-TV reported on Monday.
	   Local chiefs could also fine their subjects up to 300 rand (dlrs
50) and evict them from their areas under the new law.
	   In an interview with SABC, Jan Sithole of the Swaziland
Federation of Trade Unions called the law ``a travesty of justice''
and violation of human dignity.
	   ``It is a recipe for confrontation and a catalyst for oppression
and dictatorship at its worst,'' Sithole said.
	   A group calling itself the Tigers has said it carried out a
November bombing that claimed one life to protest Swaziland's
system of government. In October, an explosion damaged a bridge and
injured one person, two hours after the king crossed the span.
	   Political parties are banned in Swaziland, a kingdom of 1
million people sandwiched between South Africa and Mozambique.

	   HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) _ The government reinstated 68 air traffic
controllers fired a year ago for going on strike, the Public
Service Commission said.
	   The controllers were fired after they paralyzed air services in
Zimbabwe to press demands for better wages and working conditions.
	   Lance Museka, acting secretary for the commission, a state body
responsible for approving appointments to government posts, said in
a statement Monday the controllers were returning to work in
compliance with a High Court ruling that they were wrongly
dismissed.
	   The government declared the 1997 strike illegal and hired air
traffic staff from neighboring Zambia to run flight schedules.
	   The Zambians were now being phased out and were returning home,
said Museka.

Cooperation is scheduled for Jan. 22 to review progress of the
trading bloc, an official said Tuesday.
	   The group would also consider a request from Rwanda to join,
said the official who asked not to be identified.
	   The official, a member of the EAC secretariat based in Arusha,
said the meeting would deal with upgrading the current agreement
into a full-fledged treaty and the release of the much-delayed East
African passport.
	   Presidents Benjamin Mkapa of Tanzania, Daniel arap Moi of Kenya
and Yoweri Museveni of Uganda in April 1997 launched a revival of
the old East African Community that collapsed in 1977.
	   The collapse stemmed in part from differing economic policies
that have since converged into a pro-market, pro-private sector
approach in all three countries.
	   In its heyday, the community had a common airlines, railway,
postal system and currency.
	   The January summit is expected to focus on progress of
establishing a Single Market and Investment Area for the three
member states.

	   ABUJA, Nigeria (AP) _ Nigerian authorities have charged four
suspects with causing a massive explosion and deadly fire that
killed at least 700 people, according to court records released
Tuesday.
	   The suspects are accused of tampering with an oil pipeline,
triggering a leak that subsequently fueled the blast and inferno.
	   The pipeline erupted into flames in October, killing hundreds of
people who had gathered to collect spilled fuel.
	   The suspects appeared briefly in court on Monday in the
southeastern town of Warri in the oil-rich Niger River delta
region. They will remain in prison until their next court
appearance on Jan. 11, when they are expected to enter a plea.
	   Pipeline sabotage is not uncommon in Niger's delta region, where
villagers often live in subsistence poverty. Shell Oil, the largest
foreign oil firm operating in Nigeria, says the majority of minor
oil pipeline spills here are caused by sabotage.
	   Jesse community leaders, however, say the blast did not result
from sabotage but rather from neglect of the pipeline facility.

	   MAPUTO, Mozambique (AP) _ Mozambican President Joaquim Chissano
said Tuesday that a dlrs 34 million contribution from the European
Union would be used on health, education and road rehabilitation.
	   The money is part of a financing conversion connected to a
structural adjustment program, a press release from the European
Union said.
	   Last week, the EU announced that it would contribute dlrs 30
million to support the country's second democratic elections next
year.

Anarchists in Italy kidnap baby Jesus from nativity scene

<TEXT>
	   TURIN, Italy (AP) _ Anarchists kidnapped the baby Jesus from a
nativity scene set up by the northern city of Turin, demanding that
authorities free a jailed comrade, Italian newspapers reported
Tuesday.
	   ``Free Silvano now or Jesus is dead!'' an anonymous note sent to
La Repubblica newspaper and Italy's ANSA news service said.
	   A photo sent with the letter showed the round-eyed statue
clutching the front pages of two Sunday newspapers in one wooden
hand.
	   That's a common practice in ransom demands, meant to show the
victim was still alive and in captivity at the time the photo was
taken.
	   The letter was demanding the release of Silvano Pelissero, who
was arrested last spring after an alleged attempt to sabotage a
high-speed train. Two colleagues arrested with Pelissero committed
suicide.
	   The statue was stolen Sunday; a copy was in place in the
nativity scene by Tuesday.
	   Nativity scenes in Italy commonly stay up until Jan. 6,
Epiphany.
	   The man who created the scene urged that the anarchists' demand
be ignored.
	   ``Sure, they've taken a symbol, but we're only talking about a
piece of wood,'' artist Emanuele Luzzati told Corriere della Sera
newspaper.

Iraq defies U.S.; Claims it is flying aircraft in no-fly zones
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraq is challenging the no-fly zones
patrolled by the United States and Britain by flying its warplanes
there, Vice President Taha Yassin Ramadan said Tuesday.
	   During an interview with Associated Press Television News,
Ramadan was asked if Iraq was flying its own aircraft in the no-fly
zones. He replied: ``We are doing it right now.''
	   ``Iraqi planes in effect are flying in a normal manner in Iraqi
airspace,'' he said.
	   Ramadan's announcement came a day after U.S. planes fired on an
anti-aircraft battery in the northern no-fly zone. Iraq says four
soldiers were killed. The United States says its planes fired in
self-defense after coming under Iraqi missile attack.
	   The United States and its allies set up the no-fly zones in
northern and southern Iraq to protect Kurdish and Shiite Muslim
rebels from Saddam's forces.
	   ``The so-called air exclusion zones exist only in the sick
imagination of the British and American administrations,'' Ramadan
said.
	   The Iraqi defiance is likely to escalate its confrontation with
the United States and Britain, which bombed Iraq for four nights
between Dec. 16 and Dec. 19.
	   The airstrikes were reportedly aimed at diminishing Iraq's
ability to build weapons of mass destruction, which U.N. weapons
inspectors were trying to dismantle until they withdrew on Dec. 16
complaining of Iraqi obstruction.
	   Iraq says 62 soldiers and more than 40 civilians were killed in
the bombardment. Iraq also alleges that many civilian targets were
hit, and not just defense sites as claimed by the United States.
	   Ramadan also said that Iraq will continue firing at any aircraft
that violates its airspace.
	   ``Our resistance will continue against any penetration,'' he
said. ``The war is still on.''
	   Iraq had also claimed on Monday that its gunners shot down ``an
enemy plane.'' Washington denied the claim, saying all its planes
returned safely.
	   The Iraqi claim appeared in banner headlines in all Baghdad
newspapers Tuesday. ``An enemy plane is shot down and search is
under way for the wreckage and pilot,'' the Babil, owned by
President Saddam Hussein's oldest son, Odai, trumpeted.
	   But commentaries and editorials made no mention of the soldiers
reportedly killed in the U.S. attack.
	   The new challenge over the no-fly zone comes as Iraq is trying
to boost its support in the Arab world, where there is widespread
sympathy for Iraqi civilians suffering U.N. economic sanctions
imposed after Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
	   Iraqi newspapers on Tuesday hailed widespread public protests in
Arab capitals against the U.S.-British airstrikes and criticized
Arab governments, which have voiced little opposition to the
bombardment.
	   Under U.N. resolutions, the sanctions cannot be lifted until
U.N. weapons inspectors certify that Iraq is free of nuclear,
chemical and biological weapons along with long-range missiles.
	   Arab leaders must either support Iraq or risk the ``wrath'' of
the Arab masses, the newspapers said, commenting on the Arab
League's failure to convene a proposed meeting of Arab foreign
ministers to discuss and condemn the bombardment.
	   In a front-page editorial, Iraq's al-Qadissiya newspaper warned
Arab leaders that ignoring ``the snowballing Arab wrath ... will
shake the ground from under their feet.''
	   Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, in one of his most forthright
comments on the crisis, said in an interview published Monday that
Saddam's rule was responsible for his country's woes.
	   ``The ruling regime (in Iraq) is the reason for all the problems
... and Egypt naturally does not support this regime,'' Mubarak was
quoted as saying by the al-Gomhuriya, an Egyptian government-owned
newspaper.
	   Mubarak, a close U.S. ally, also said that it was he who
persuaded U.S. President Bill Clinton to halt the bombardment,
whose stated aim was to diminish Iraq's ability to build weapons of
mass destruction.
	   Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz responded to Mubarak with
harsh words in an editorial he wrote for Tuesday's al-Jumhouriya,
an Iraqi government-owned newspaper.
	   ``President Mubarak assumes a role for himself which both
Washington and London have not given to him,'' Aziz wrote in the
front-page editorial.
	   ``In reality there is no noble, fair and intelligent person in
Egypt, in the Arab homeland or the whole world sharing Mr. Mubarak
in his deduction,'' Aziz wrote.
	   He said that in reality Mubarak called for a halt to the strikes
because he feared the anger in the Egyptian and Arab streets.

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ A Lithuanian swimmer was banned for four years,
while two South American water polo players received three-month
suspensions for drug violations.
	   Swimming's world governing body (FINA) said Giedu Rafanavicius
was handed a four-year suspension by the Lithuanian federation
after testing positive for a steroid, metandienone metabolite.
	   The suspension goes into effect from June 25, 1998, the date of
the positive test.
	   Swimming is one of the few sports which mandates a four-year
suspension for drug use. Other sports apply bans of two years or
less for steroids.
	   Meanwhile, water polo players Wilson Caldeira of Brazil and
Claudio Reginato of Chile were sanctioned by the South American
association for positive drug tests during last April's South
American Championships in Venezuela.
	   FINA said Caldeira was suspended for three months, starting
April 11, after testing positive for marijuana. The Brazilian team
was disqualified and stripped of the gold medal, with first place
awarded to the Colombian team.
	   Reginato also was suspended for three months, starting April 11,
after testing positive for the stimulants ephedrine,
pseudoephedrine, phenylpropanalomine and cathine. The Chilean team
was disqualified.

	   Earlier Tuesday, Yemeni officials began negotiations with
Islamic extremists for the release of the Western tourists while
security forces encircled the area where the militants were
believed to be holding the hostages.
	   Gov. Ahmad Ali Mohsen of Abyan province, where the kidnappings
occurred, was talking with leaders of the Al-Fadl tribe, an
official at the governor's office said. Mohsen was accompanied by
Islamic figures who are influential with the abductors, the
official said on condition of anonymity.
	   A security official said about 200 troops were deployed Tuesday
in Abyan.
	   Tribes often kidnap tourists in Yemen to gain government
concessions such as new roads, water supply or clinics. The
hostages are usually released unharmed.
	   This was the first time an abduction has been carried out by
Islamic militants. Security officials said the kidnappers belong to
Islamic Jihad, many of whose leaders fought in Afghanistan and are
believed to have connections with Egyptian Muslim radicals.
	   The kidnapping occurred Monday near the southern town of
Mawdiyah, about 200 kilometers (175 miles) south of the capital,
San`a.
	   The group is demanding the release of its leader, Saleh Haidara
al-Atwi, who was arrested two weeks ago as part of a government
crackdown on Islamic vigilantes enforcing strict Islamic rules in
southern Yemen. The kidnappers also want the release of another
leader, said security officials who did not identify him.
	   They said Islamic Jihad members flog women for ignoring the
Islamic dress code and men for selling and drinking alcohol, which
is forbidden in Islam. The group, which has no more than 200
members, also ran a military camp in southern Yemen, officials
said.
	   The kidnappers, who included 10 gunmen and eight others,
ambushed a convoy of five vehicles in which the tourists were
traveling and opened fire on a number of policemen escorting them,
officials said.
	   The gunmen threatened to kill the hostages if the police didn't
back off, said one official.
	   He said all the gunmen sported beards typical of Islamists and
had military training.
	   During the melee, the British tour leader and a Yemeni guide
escaped.
	   The Australian Embassy in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, which handles
Yemen, said a diplomat was on his way to San`a on Tuesday to try to
secure the release of the hostages.
	   In April, a British couple and their teen-age son were kidnapped
but released unharmed a month later.
	   Four Germans are also being held at present by a tribe in
northeast Yemen. The kidnappers are demanding more schools,
hospitals and telephone lines in their area.
	   Yemen was once a haven for Islamic militant fugitives from other
countries, but the government has expelled many of them.

Nissho Iwai to slash 1,000 jobs by March 2002
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Nissho Iwai Corp., one of Japan's major general
trading companies, said Tuesday it will cut 1,000 jobs, or nearly a
quarter of its work force, by March 2002 in a sweeping
restructuring plan.
	   Nissho Iwai, Japan's sixth largest trading firm, said the plan
followed an agreement with a group of eight creditors, led by Sanwa
Bank Ltd.
	   The group has pledged to lend a total of 600 billion yen (dlrs
5.2 billion) to Nissho Iwai and the agreement will be signed early
January next year, the company said in a statement.
	   Nissho Iwai said the plan calls for reducing its assets by 1.6
trillion yen (dlrs 13.9 billion) to 3.9 trillion yen (dlrs 33.9
billion), including at overseas operations. The company will reduce
assets at the parent company alone by 800 billion yen (dlrs 7
billion) to 2.2 trillion yen (dlrs 19 billion) by March, 2002.
	   The statement said Nissho Iwai also will cut salaries for its
board members by 20 percent to 50 percent.
	   Company officials declined to discuss details of the plan
further, but Kyodo News agency said Nissho Iwai expects a net loss
of 40 billion yen (dlrs 348 million) for the current business year
ending March 31.

Iraq defies US, claims it is flying aircraft in no-fly zones
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Combines URGENT series; minor editing throughout &QL; 
 &UR; AP Photos BAG101-103
 &UR; By LEON BARKHO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraq is challenging the no-fly zones
patrolled by the United States and Britain by flying its warplanes
there, Vice President Taha Yassin Ramadan said Tuesday.
	   During an interview with Associated Press Television News,
Ramadan was asked if Iraq was flying its own aircraft in the no-fly
zones. He replied: ``We are doing it right now.''
	   ``Iraqi planes in effect are flying in a normal manner in Iraqi
airspace,'' he said.
	   Ramadan's announcement came a day after U.S. planes fired on an
anti-aircraft battery in the northern no-fly zone. Iraq says four
soldiers were killed. The United States says its planes fired in
self-defense after coming under Iraqi missile attack.
	   The United States and allies set up the no-fly zones in northern
and southern Iraq to protect Kurdish and Shiite Muslim rebels from
forces of Iraqi President Saddam Hussein.
	   ``The so-called air exclusion zones exist only in the sick
imagination of the British and American administrations,'' Ramadan
said.
	   The Iraqi defiance is likely to escalate its confrontation with
the United States and Britain, which bombed Iraq for four nights
from Dec. 16 to Dec. 19.
	   The stated aim of the airstrikes was to diminish Iraq's ability
to build weapons of mass destruction, which U.N. weapons inspectors
were trying to dismantle until they withdrew on Dec. 16 complaining
of Iraqi obstruction.
	   Iraq says 62 soldiers and more than 40 civilians were killed in
the bombardment. Iraq also alleges that many civilian targets were
hit, and not just defense sites as claimed by the United States.
	   Ramadan also said that Iraq will continue firing at any aircraft
that intrudes on its airspace.
	   ``Our resistance will continue against any penetration,'' he
said. ``The war is still on.''
	   Iraq had also claimed on Monday that its gunners shot down ``an
enemy plane.'' Washington denied the claim, saying all its planes
returned safely.
	   The Iraqi claim appeared in banner headlines in all Baghdad
newspapers Tuesday. ``An enemy plane is shot down and search is
under way for the wreckage and pilot,'' trumpeted the Babil
newspaper, owned by Saddam's oldest son, Odai.
	   But commentaries and editorials made no mention of the soldiers
reportedly killed in the U.S. attack.
	   The new challenge over the no-fly zone comes as Iraq is trying
to boost its support in the Arab world, where there is widespread
sympathy for Iraqi civilians suffering U.N. economic sanctions
imposed after Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
	   Iraqi newspapers on Tuesday hailed widespread public protests in
Arab capitals against the U.S.-British airstrikes and criticized
Arab governments, which have voiced little opposition to the
bombardment.
	   Under U.N. resolutions, the sanctions cannot be lifted until
U.N. weapons inspectors certify that Iraq is free of nuclear,
chemical and biological weapons along with long-range missiles.
	   Arab leaders must either support Iraq or risk the ``wrath'' of
the Arab masses, the newspapers said, commenting on the Arab
League's failure to convene a proposed meeting of Arab foreign
ministers to discuss and condemn the bombardment.
	   In a front-page editorial, Iraq's al-Qadissiya newspaper warned
Arab leaders that ignoring ``the snowballing Arab wrath ... will
shake the ground from under their feet.''
	   Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, in one of his most forthright
comments on the crisis, said in an interview published Monday that
Saddam's rule was responsible for his country's woes.
	   Mubarak, a close U.S. ally, also said that it was he who
persuaded U.S. President Bill Clinton to halt the bombardment,
whose stated aim was to diminish Iraq's ability to build weapons of
mass destruction.
	   Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz responded to Mubarak with
harsh words in an editorial he wrote for Tuesday's al-Jumhouriya,
an Iraqi government-owned newspaper.
	   ``President Mubarak assumes a role for himself which both
Washington and London have not given to him,'' Aziz wrote in the
front-page editorial.
	   ``In reality there is no noble, fair and intelligent person in
Egypt, in the Arab homeland or the whole world sharing Mr. Mubarak
in his deduction,'' Aziz wrote.
	   He said that in reality Mubarak called for a halt to the strikes
because he feared the anger in the Egyptian and Arab streets.

Ukraine's population continues to decline
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Ukraine's population declined by an
estimated 205,000 people in 1998, and now stands at 50.09 million,
the State Statistics Committee said Tuesday.
	   The country's population has been declining steadily in the past
several years. A protracted economic decline has left millions
impoverished, pushing down birth rates and worsening the national
health care system, contributing to higher mortality rates.
	   The 1998 figures, however, signal a smaller rate of decline from
the previous three years, when Ukraine's population was contracting
by about 400,000 people annually.
	   The average life expectancy in the former Soviet republic
currently stands at 62.3 years for men and 73.2 for women,
approximately nine years behind Western nations, according to
official figures.
	   The Health Ministry recently estimated that Ukraine's population
would contract by another 2 million people by as early as 2002.

More international verifiers arriving, NATO warns warring sides
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds; UPDATES with more bodies found, details.
 &UR; By MISHA SAVIC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) - About 100 international observers
were en route Tuesday to Kosovo to shore up efforts to minimize
fighting in the ethnic-Albanian majority Serbian province amid new
NATO warnings of possible intervention.
	   Their arrival will boost the Kosovo verification mission to
about 700 people, with the envisaged total of 2,000 expected to be
reached by mid-January, said Sandy Blyth, a spokesman for the
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which runs the
operation.
	   The arrivals follow violence last week in the north of the
province that further frayed a shaky de-facto truce established in
October. Authorities seeking to banish a threatened NATO strike
then agreed to end a months-long crackdown on Kosovo's ethnic
Albanians that left hundreds dead and hundreds of thousands _ most
of them ethnic Albanians _ on the run.
	   Reacting to the recent upsurge, NATO said from its headquarters
in Brussels, Belgium, on Tuesday that it remained ``ready to
intervene'' if violence intensifies in the province and demanded
both sides respect the informal cease fire.
	   KLA spokesman Adem Demaci told reporters in Pristina that the
guerrillas will respect the cease-fire ``but we will defend
ourselves with all means if necessary.''
	   Two bodies were found Tuesday morning under a bridge on the road
leading north from the province's capital Pristina, close to the
town of Kosovska Mitrovica. Police said the two frozen corpses were
ethnic Albanian.
	   Two more bodies _ also ethnic Albanian _ were discovered near
Prizren. Police said at least one of the victims was loyal to the
Serb regime, and that they were conducting an ``intensive search
for terrorists'' in the area.
	   The Kosovo Information Center, run by the pro-independence
Kosovo Albanian leadership reported some overnight shooting on the
outskirts of Kosovska Mitrovica which ``made the situation there
very tense and difficult.''
	   In the wake of the recent fighting, Serbs from the region most
affected demanded protection from Slobodan Milosevic, president of
Yugoslavia, of which Serbia is the main republic. In an open
letter, made public in Belgrade, they said they don't want to
continue being victims of ethnic Albanian guerrillas seeking the
province's independence.
	   The Serbs, from the northern Podujevo region, said this was
their last ``desperate'' appeal to the Yugoslav authorities before
they pack up and flee Kosovo because of ``the terror'' of ethnic
Albanian guerrillas who hold much of the region in their hands.
	   ``We demand that you use all available means to protect our
lives and territory,'' the letter said. ``If you are not ready to
help us, tell us loud and clear so we don't keep on dying in
vain.''
	   The fighting began on the Christmas Eve and lasted for four
days, resulting in 15 deaths, dozens of wounded and at least 5,000
displaced people.
	   Serbs, a tiny minority in the Podujevo region, said that 13
Serbs still are unaccounted for after the fighting. They said they
evacuated some 200 of their children from the region, where ethnic
Albanian guerrillas continue patrols.
	   Blyth said Kosovo Tuesday was ``reasonably quiet ... although
there are still areas which are tense.''
	   He said Italians, Finns, Germans, Swedes, Turks, Americans,
Britons, Canadians, Russians, Spaniards, Norwegians, French,
Estonians and a Lithuanian were in the latest group of observers.

	   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ The commanding general of
the German Fourth Corps, Lt. Gen. Hans-Peter von Kirchbach, arrived
in Bosnia on Tuesday to spend New Year's eve with his soldiers

China's Communist Party kicks out leader for corruption
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ China's Communist Party has kicked out a
high-ranking provincial leader for corruption and ordered other
officials to draw ``bitter lessons'' from his fall from power,
official media said Tuesday.
	   Meng Qingping, a former vice governor of central Hubei province,
has been arrested, the Xinhua News Agency said. Meng, who took up
his post in 1993, is the latest high-ranking official exposed in a
five-year-old government campaign against rampant corruption.
	   Meng's alleged misdeeds date back as far as 1989, when, as vice
governor of southern Hainan province, he helped a businessman
falsify paperwork to buy land, Xinhua said.
	   In thanks, the businessman gave Meng the equivalent of U.S. dlrs
25,000 via his wife, as well as other money at Chinese New Year for
four years, Xinhua said. Meng took other gifts after he moved to
Hubei in April 1993, it said.
	   ``Meng Qingping also was morally degenerate, led a rotten life,
had promiscuous sexual relations and dallied with women,'' Xinhua
alleged.
	   Meng came from a poor family and ``it was the party that trained
him from a cowherd into a university student,'' the report said.
	   As he rose through the ranks, however, ``he relaxed the demands
on his thinking,'' associated with wealthy business people, finally
becoming a ``corrupt element,'' the report said.
	   Meng has been stripped of his Communist Party membership, it
said.
	   ``Leaders and officials at all levels must draw bitter lessons
from Meng Qingping's case,'' it said.

No trial for Khmer Rouge leaders, but evidence is there

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ No Khmer Rouge leaders may ever face
trial, but evidence that they sanctioned torture and executions
during the group's genocidal rule is all there for any prosecutor
needing it.
	   Steven Heder, one of the world's leading experts on the Khmer
Rouge reign of terror between 1975 and 1979, showed such
documentation to reporters after Prime Minister Hun Sen dismissed
holding trials for Khmer Rouge leaders on political grounds.
	   Two former leaders, Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan, met Hun Sen in
the capital Tuesday to defect and end their role in a lost civil
war. Hun Sen has said they should not be tried in the interests of
national reconciliation.
	   The pair told reporters they were ``very sorry'' but failed to
accept responsibility for the deaths of as many as 2 million
Cambodians between 1975 and 1979.
	   Heder showed journalists reports received by Nuon Chea and Ieng
Sary, another top leader pardoned two years ago in a bid to bleed
away Khmer Rouge strength when the group was still a powerful
force.
	   The reports from their subordinates contain descriptions of
execution and torture that provide a window into the paranoia that
gripped the Khmer Rouge leaders as they purged the ranks of
suspected traitors.
	   ``It is documentation that Ieng Sary and Nuon Chea were part of
an information loop on executions,'' Heder said. ``It shows they
were aware of what was going on.''
	   One document describes the execution of an official in the
northern province of Preah Vihear on suspicion that he had ``turned
against the movement.'' The writer states the victim was believed
to be part of a group previously rounded up and exterminated.
	   Another report detailed how 20 suspects were ``beaten and
interrogated'' for suspected disloyalty.
	   Nuon Chea was regarded as the movement's political theorist and
second-in-command to supreme leader Pol Pot. Ieng Sary was a deputy
prime minister and brother-in-law of Pol Pot.
	   Evidence against Khieu Samphan, long portrayed as a moderate
intellectual, is more circumstantial, Heder has said, but shows he
built his career in the bloody purges.
	   More documentation exists in the files of a center that has
spent the past several years digging up evidence to be used in the
event any Khmer Rouge leader is ever brought to justice.

<TEXT>
	   Earlier Tuesday, Yemeni officials began negotiations with the
Islamic extremists for the release of the tourists. Some 200 Yemeni
security forces encircled the area where they were being held.
	   Gov. Ahmad Ali Mohsen of Abyan province, where the kidnapping
took place, was leading the talks with leaders of the Al-Fadl
tribe, to which the kidnappers belong, an official at the
governor's office said.
	   Mohsen was accompanied by Islamic personalities influential with
the abductors, the official said, speaking on condition of
anonymity.
	   The kidnapping occurred Monday near the southern town of
Mawdiyah, about 200 kilometers (175 miles) south of the Yemen
capital San`a.
	   Kidnapping of tourists by tribes is a commonly used method in
Yemen to gain concessions from the government such as new roads,
water supply or clinics. The hostages generally are released
unharmed.
	   The latest incident marked the first time an abduction was
carried out by Islamic extremists. Security officials said the
kidnappers belong to Islamic Jihad, many of whose leaders fought in
Afghanistan and are believed to have connections with Egyptian
Muslim radicals.
	   The group is demanding the release of its leader, Saleh Haidara
al-Atwi, who was arrested two weeks ago as part of a government
crackdown on Islamic vigilantes enforcing strict Islamic rules in
southern Yemen.
	   The kidnappers also are demanding the release of another leader,
Yemen security officials said. They did not identify him.
	   They said Islamic Jihad members flogged women for ignoring the
Islamic dress code and men for selling and drinking alcohol, which
is forbidden in Islam.
	   The group, which has no more than 200 members, also ran a
military camp in southern Yemen, the security officials said.
	   They said the kidnappers, who included 10 gunmen and eight
others, ambushed a convoy of five vehicles in which the tourists
were traveling and opened fire on a number of policemen escorting
them.
	   The gunmen threatened to kill the hostages if the police didn't
back off, said one official.
	   He said all the gunmen sported beards typical of Islamists and
had received military training.
	   During the melee, the British tour leader and a Yemeni guide
escaped and raised alarm.
	   The Australian Embassy in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, which handles
Yemen, said a diplomat was on his way to San`a on Tuesday to try to
secure the release of the hostages.
	   A British couple and their teen-age son were kidnapped in April
but released unharmed a month later.
	   Four Germans are also being held at present by a tribe in
northeast Yemen. The kidnappers are demanding more schools,
hospitals and telephone lines in their area.
	   Yemen was once a haven for Islamic militant fugitives from other
countries, but the government has expelled many of them.

Turkey's premier-designate confident he can form new government
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ The independent lawmaker trying to put
together a new government for Turkey was rebuffed by a leading
center-right party Tuesday but expressed confidence he could still
piece together a governing coalition.
	   Yalim Erez is seeking backing for a multiparty coalition to lead
the country until April parliamentary elections.
	   He opened negotiations with party leaders on Monday, seeking
pledges of support that would assure his coalition the necessary
majority of votes in parliament.
	   ``I believe that after a second round of talks, I will be able
to present a Cabinet list to the president for approval next
week,'' Erez said.
	   ``I am very hopeful. I am more hopeful today than yesterday,''
he added.
	   His optimism comes despite his failure to win support from True
Path Party leader Tansu Ciller. The two have been at odds since
Erez was expelled from True Path last year for opposing Mrs.
Ciller's alliance with an Islamic party.
	   ``She said it was not possible for her party to join my
government and said I should return the mandate immediately,'' Erez
said after a short meeting with Mrs. Ciller.
	   Even without her support, Erez, who has the backing of three
other parties, appeared likely to be able to form a Cabinet.
	   The Islamic Virtue Party, the largest bloc in parliament, has
withheld immediate support for Erez but not turned him down
outright.
	   Turkey's leaders have been trying to come up with a new
government since last month, when a coalition government led by
center-right leader Mesut Yilmaz collapsed over allegations that he
rigged the sale of a bank. Yilmaz has stayed on as acting premier.
	   Veteran leftist politician Bulent Ecevit tried for three weeks
to form a governing coalition that excluded the Islamic party. He
finally gave up, unable to form a purely secular alliance of
Turkey's bickering center-left and center-right parties.
	   Erez took over efforts to form a government last week, hoping
that an independent would be better able than a partisan lawmaker
to form a broad-based coalition.
	   Unlike Ecevit, Erez was willing to negotiate with the Islamic
party.

<TEXT>
	   MANNHEIM, Germany (AP) _ Both sides filed appeals Tuesday in the
tax evasion conviction of Matthias Hoffmann, a former concert
promoter who helped organize the ``Three Tenors'' concerts.
	   Hoffmann, 47, was convicted Dec. 22 of evading 15 million marks
(dlrs 9 million) in taxes and sentenced to five years and eight
months in prison.
	   Prosecutors had sought a sentence of seven years, while the
defense had asked for less than five.
	   Appeals were filed with the Federal Court of Justice in
Karlsruhe, but neither side would comment on them.
	   The tenors _ Luciano Pavarotti, Jose Carreras, Placido Domingo _
and soprano Montserrat Caballe were named as suspects last month
for allegedly helping Hoffmann evade taxes. They are still under
investigation.

Prime minister meets with opposition leader to discuss coalition
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES thruout with Obuchi meeting Ozawa; CHANGES overline,

 &UR; By YURI KAGEYAMA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ After days of haggling between party negotiators,
Japanese Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi held a key meeting with an
opposition leader late Tuesday and agreed to keep working toward a
coalition government.
	   Earlier in the day, party officials said Obuchi's meeting with
Liberal Party head Ichiro Ozawa would be postponed until next year
after negotiators failed to forge an agreement over defense policy
_ the main sticking point in the talks.
	   Ozawa, who defected from the ruling Liberal Democratic Party in
1993 to form a more reform-oriented party, has long pushed for a
new interpretation of the Constitution of Japan that would allow
troops to take part more in U.N. military missions.
	   Some Liberal Democrats, however, who want to restrict troops to
non-combat operations, are worried about entering a coalition with
Ozawa.
	   Japan's decades-long inability to tackle such defense issues has
come to the forefront recently since North Korea fired a missile
over Japan in August, serving as a chilling reminder of the
nation's vulnerability to attack.
	   In the late-night meeting at the prime minister's residence,
Obuchi and Ozawa confirmed their commitment to work toward a
coalition government, both sides said.
	   But they did not fully iron out differences in policy and did
not discuss Cabinet posts, said a Liberal Party official, speaking
on condition of anonymity.
	   ``If our policies and views are not realized, then I'd like to
scrap our initial agreement,'' Ozawa told reporters.
	   Obuchi and Ozawa first signed a tentative agreement in November
to work toward a coalition government _ a critical move in the
ruling Liberal Democratic Party's efforts to gain a stable grip on
political power.
	   The ruling party lacks a majority in the upper house of
Parliament and needs support from other parties to get bills passed
at a time when public dissent is growing over the nation's ailing
economy.
	   ``We reconfirmed our commitment,'' Obuchi said. ``I hope to do
my utmost as head of the Liberal Democratic Party to carry out my
promises.''
	   Having Ozawa on board could boost market sentiments because he
is viewed as more aggressive on tax cuts and other measures to turn
around the economy.
	   Ozawa's presence could also help Japan's image at a time when
Tokyo is under serious international pressure to do more to
jump-start its economy.
	   But having a coalition partner is extremely sensitive for senior
ruling party politicians because it means fewer possible Cabinet
posts for party members.
	   The two sides have already agreed to Ozawa's proposal to reduce
Cabinet posts from 20 to 18 as part of an effort toward smaller
government.
	   Obuchi has promised a Cabinet post for Ozawa, but it is unclear
how long it will take for both sides to agree on a specific post
for Ozawa.
	   In recent weeks, politicians have criticized the Obuchi-Ozawa
agreement as merely personal and expressed doubts about a
coalition.

Ukrainian miner dies following self-immolation
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ A Ukrainian miner who set himself on fire
two weeks before over unpaid wages died in a hospital despite
intensive medical treatment, a news report said Tuesday.
	   Oleksandr Mykhalevych, 35, immolated himself Dec. 14 in front of
the regional government headquarters in the city of Luhansk to
protest months of overdue wages.
	   He was hospitalized with burns covering nearly half of his body
and died late Monday, despite several skin transplant operations,
the Interfax news agency said.
	   Mykhalevych was among 200 miners from the city of Krasnodon who
had picketed the regional administration building in Luhansk since
the summer to demand overdue salaries.
	   The protesters finally received the money owed them several days
after Mykhalevych set himself ablaze.
	   Dozens of mines throughout Ukraine were protesting for months
this year, but the cash-strapped government failed to allocate more
subsidies for the ailing industry and repay the wage debt.
	   Miners are currently owed about dlrs 2.3 billion hryvna (dlrs
670 million), and the debt has been growing.

	   PIRAEUS, Greece (AP) _ Two time bombs exploded early Tuesday
outside a Barclays Bank branch and former American Express offices
in Greece's main port, causing damage but no injuries, police said.
	   The dynamite bombs exploded within six minutes of each other,
shortly after police received a warning from an anonymous caller
claiming to represent the little-known group Revolutionary Cells.
	   The daily newspaper Eleftherotypia said an anonymous caller to
its offices claimed the attacks were carried out as ``resistance to
the criminal NATO alliance.''
	   The caller also criticized the European Union and the United
States, adding that the attack was also a form of ``resistance to
... capitalist dictatorship,'' Eleftherotypia said.
	   Barclays bank sustained significant damage from the blast.
Windows were also shattered in nearby buildings and seven cars
parked nearby were also damaged, said authorities in Piraeus, about
10 kilometers (six miles) south of central Athens.
	   A former American Express branch, located about 500 meters (547
yards) away, was also seriously damaged.
	   American Express had moved out of the building more than two
years ago, but its sign remained outside, a company official said.

Gorbachev says he lost his money in Russian financial crisis
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MUNICH, Germany (AP) _ Former Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev
says in an interview published Tuesday that he lost his savings _
about dlrs 80,000 _ in Russia's financial crisis last summer.
	   ``All my money is gone,'' he told Bunte magazine.
	   The financial turmoil in August sent the Moscow bank where he
had his account into bankruptcy, he said. Because of the loss, he
said he hasn't been able to pay the employees at his personally
financed foundation for months either.
	   ``You know, I'm not really as rich as many in the West think,''
he said. ``The 'new rich' here in Moscow often spend more in one
night than I earn in a whole year.''
	   Gorbachev said he hoped to sign a lucrative deal for a new book
he is working on, which he hopes to have published for the 10th
anniversary of German reunification next October.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ About 100 international observers
were heading Tuesday to Kosovo in efforts to curb fighting in the
ethnic-Albanian majority Serbian province while NATO reiterated
warnings of possible intervention.
	   The observers' arrival will boost the Kosovo monitoring mission
to about 700 people, with the envisaged total of 2,000 expected to
be reached by mid-January, said Sandy Blyth, a spokesman for the
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which runs the
operation.
	   The arrivals follow violence last week in the north of the
province that further frayed a shaky de-facto truce established in
October. Authorities seeking to avert a threatened NATO strike then
agreed to end a months-long crackdown on Kosovo's separatist-minded
ethnic Albanians.
	   The months of violence left hundreds dead and hundreds of
thousands _ most of them ethnic Albanians _ on the run in Kosovo, a
province of the dominant Yugoslavian republic of Serbia.
	   Reacting to the recent upsurge, NATO said Tuesday from its
headquarters in Brussels, Belgium, that it remained ``ready to
intervene'' if violence intensifies in the province and demanded
that both sides respect the informal cease fire.
	   KLA spokesman Adem Demaci told reporters in Pristina that the
guerrillas will respect the cease-fire ``but we will defend
ourselves with all means if necessary.''
	   Two bodies were found Tuesday morning under a bridge on the road
leading north from the province's capital Pristina, close to the
town of Kosovska Mitrovica. Police said the two frozen corpses were
ethnic Albanian.
	   Two more bodies _ also ethnic Albanian _ were discovered near
Prizren. Police said at least one of the victims was loyal to the
Serb regime, and that they were conducting an ``intensive search
for terrorists'' in the area.

	   PIRAEUS, Greece (AP) _ Two time bombs exploded early Tuesday
outside a Barclays Bank branch and former American Express offices
in Greece's main port, causing damage but no injuries, police said.
	   The dynamite bombs exploded within six minutes of each other,
shortly after police received a warning from an anonymous caller
claiming to represent the little-known group Revolutionary Cells.
	   The daily newspaper Eleftherotypia said an anonymous caller to
its offices claimed the attacks were carried out as ``resistance to
the criminal NATO alliance.''
	   The caller also criticized the European Union and the United
States, adding that the attack was also a form of ``resistance to
... capitalist dictatorship,'' Eleftherotypia said.
	   Barclays bank sustained significant damage from the blast.
Windows were also shattered in nearby buildings and seven cars
parked nearby were also damaged, said authorities in Piraeus, about
10 kilometers (six miles) south of central Athens.
	   A former American Express branch, located about 500 meters (550
yards) away, was also seriously damaged.
	   American Express had moved out of the building more than two
years ago, but its sign remained outside, a company official said.

<TEXT>
	   SAN`A, Yemen (AP) _ Two British men and an American woman were
killed on Tuesday when Yemeni security forces attempted to rescue
them from Islamic extremist kidnappers, a Yemeni security official
said.
	   The other 13 Western hostages were freed, but three suffered
injuries in the shootout between the security forces and the
militants, he said.
	   He said that two British men and an Australian man were wounded.
Names were not immediately available. The official spoke on
customary condition of anonymity.
	   He said that two of the kidnappers and a policeman also died in
the clash and that a kidnapper and three policemen were wounded.
	   Helicopters were dispatched to the area to evacuate the injured,
he said.
	   The kidnapping occurred Monday near the southern town of
Mawdiyah, about 200 kilometers (175 miles) south of the Yemen
capital San`a.
	   The hostages included 12 Britons _ six of them women _ two
American women and two Australian men.
	   They were taken when 18 men ambushed a convoy of five vehicles
in which the tourists were traveling and opened fire on their
police escorts. The kidnappers threatened to kill the tourists if
the police did not back off.
	   During the melee, the British tour leader and a Yemeni guide
escaped and raised the alarm.
	   Kidnapping of tourists by tribes is a commonly used method in
Yemen to gain concessions from the government such as new roads,
water supply or clinics. The hostages generally are released
unharmed.
	   But the latest incident marked the first time an abduction was
carried out by Islamic extremists. Security officials said the
kidnappers belong to Islamic Jihad, many of whose leaders fought in
Afghanistan and are believed to have connections with Egyptian
Muslim radicals.
	   Earlier Tuesday, Yemeni officials began negotiations with the
Islamic extremists for the release of the tourists. Some 200 Yemeni
security forces encircled the area.
	   Gov. Ahmad Ali Mohsen of Abyan province, where the kidnapping
took place, was leading the talks with leaders of the Al-Fadl
tribe, to which the kidnappers belong, an official at the
governor's office said.
	   Mohsen was accompanied by Islamic personalities influential with
the abductors, the official said, speaking on condition of
anonymity.
	   The kidnappers demanded the release of their leader, Saleh
Haidara al-Atwi, who was arrested two weeks ago as part of a
government crackdown on Islamic vigilantes enforcing strict Islamic
rules in southern Yemen.
	   The kidnappers also wanted the release of another leader, Yemen
security officials said. They did not identify him.
	   They said Islamic Jihad members flogged women for ignoring the
Islamic dress code and men for selling and drinking alcohol, which
is forbidden in Islam.
	   The group, which has no more than 200 members, also ran a
military camp in southern Yemen, the security officials said.
	   Yemen was once a haven for Islamic militant fugitives from other
countries, but the government has expelled many of them.
	   The Australian Embassy in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, which handles
Yemen, said a diplomat was on his way to San`a on Tuesday to try to
secure the release of the hostages.
	   A British couple and their teen-age son were kidnapped in April
but released unharmed a month later.
	   Four Germans are being held at present by a tribe in northeast
Yemen. The kidnappers are demanding more schools, hospitals and
telephone lines in their area.

Ref admits he was wrong to expel Villa goalkeeper
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BIRMINGHAM, England (AP) _ Top referee Dermot Gallagher has
admitted he was wrong to expel Aston Villa goalkeeper Michael Oakes
on Saturday for handling the ball outside his area.
	   Oakes did handle the ball outside the penalty box when the
momentum of racing out to catch it took him over the line. But he
let go as soon as he realized he had gone too far and was amazed
when Gallagher stuck to the letter of the law and showed him the
red card in Villa's 2-1 loss at Blackburn.
	   It was a defeat that temporarily cost Villa first place in the
Premier League and manager John Gregory was furious with
Gallagher's handling of the incident.
	   Goalkeepers are expelled automatically for deliberately handling
the ball outside the area to prevent an obvious goalscoring
opportunity. This was not the case this time and Villa, hoping that
Oakes will avoid a suspension, contended that the officials were
wrong.
	   Gallagher issued the red card after consulting his linesman and,
according the Football Association, now admits they made a mistake.
	   ``Dermot Gallagher, in consultation with Philip Don, the Premier
League's referees' officer, has reviewed the video of the sending
off of Aston Villa goalkeeper Michael Oakes in the game against
Blackburn,'' said Premier League spokesman Mike Lee.
	   ``In discussion with referee's assistant (linesman) Dave
Horlick, they have concluded that there was a genuine error of
judgment by the assistant.
	   ``Mr. Gallagher will now be writing to the Football Association
to inform them of his conclusion, with a view to the sending off
not being dealt with as a disciplinary matter.''
	   Don said it was likely the FA would accept Gallagher's change of
mind.
	   ``At the end of the day we want to see the right decisions are
made and Dermot has agreed to write to the FA and inform them an
error was made,'' the former World Cup referee said.
	   ``I would now expect the FA to reverse the decision once they
receive Dermot's letter and his report.''

	   COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) _ A Swedish priest was sentenced
Tuesday to 30 days in jail on Tuesday after admitting he attempted
to smuggle two men into Denmark.
	   The 62-year-old Lutheran priest, whose identity was not
disclosed, was arrested late Monday in Nakskov in southern Denmark,
upon arriving from Germany by ferry. During a random check, police
found the men, who were believed to be from Iraq, hidden in his car
trunk.
	   The priest told the court in the town of Maribo that his motives
were humanitarian. He picked up the men in Austria and Germany,
Danish radio reported.
	   The court banned him from entering Denmark for the next five
years.
	   The two refugees likely would be returned to Germany.

<TEXT>
	   FREETOWN, Sierra Leone (AP) _ Rebel forces battling to oust
President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah have taken control of the central town
of Makeni, defense force officers said Tuesday.
	   Makeni, a strategic town about 120 kilometers (75 miles)
northeast of the capital, Freetown, was the scene of recent heavy
fighting.
	   Rebel fighters battling a West African coalition army known as
ECOMOG succeeded in pushing the defense force into a ``tactical
retreat,'' according to an ECOMOG statement.
	   Sierra Leone's Foreign Minister Sam Banya on Monday said
virtually the entire population of several thousand people fled
Makeni.
	   The rebel Revolutionary United Front has launched a series of
offensives in recent weeks to recapture ground lost to Nigerian-led
ECOMOG troops earlier in the year. In February, the coalition force
ousted a military junta with ties to the Revolutionary United
Front.
	   The West African intervention force fighting under the banner of
the Economic Community of West African States has stayed on in
Sierra Leone to help defend Kabbah's elected government.
	   ECOMOG troops, including fresh reinforcements from Ghana, are
now focused on defending the capital, a senior official from Ghana
said.
	   ``We have sent some men and officers to help beef up what is
already on the ground,'' said the senior Ghanaian defense ministry
official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
	   Ghana, a member nation in the ECOWAS bloc, is considering
additional support for the Sierra Leone operation.
	   Nigeria, meanwhile, sent an additional 1,000 soldiers to back up
their positions in Freetown.
	   Diplomats from West Africa, the United States and Britain
meeting Monday in the Ivory Coast called for more aid to help
defend Sierra Leone's embattled government.
	   Nigeria has assumed the vast majority of responsibilities for
ECOMOG, along with Ghana and Guinea. The United States and Britain
have provided logistical support for the regional task force.
	   Rebel units, however, claim to have closed to within 20
kilometers (12 miles) of the capital and have threatened to start
shelling the city.
	   Banya said mercenaries from Liberia, Burkina Faso and the
Ukraine were fighting alongside the rebels. That claim could not be
independently confirmed.
	   ``The rebels must cease fighting immediately, lay down their
arms and accept President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah's government as the
sole legitimate government,'' the ECOWAS statement said.

<TEXT>
	   OBERWIESENTHAL, Germany (AP) _ Finland's Hannu Manninen won a
dash to the finish line Tuesday to capture his fifth World Cup race
of the season at a Nordic Combined sprint event.
	   Manninen sprinted past Norway's Kenneth Braaten in a furious
finish in the 7.5 kilometer cross-country race to win by 1.3
seconds.
	   Braaten led after the jumping, gaining 124.5 points to
Manninen's 121.5. But the Finn completed the cross-country portion
in 19 minutes, 49.7 seconds to wipe out the deficit.
	   Finland's Samppa Lajunen finished third, 34.3 seconds back.
	   Norway's double Olympic champion Bjarte-Engen Vik struggled to
sixth place, taking himself out of contention with poor jumping
that netted him just 108 points.
	   Vik failed to crack the top three for the first time this
season.
	   Manninen, 20, won the 10th World Cup event of his career and
built his lead in the overall standings out with 935 points to
Vik's 825. Austria's Felix Gottwald is a distant third with 515.
	   Manninen has reached the podium in all seven World Cup events
this season.

<TEXT>
	   VILNIUS, Lithuania (AP) _ Free agent center Arvydas Sabonis on
Tuesday joined Lithuania's national champion Zalgiras Vilnius and
will play for them in the European league during the NBA lockout.
	   Sabonis, who played for the Portland Trail Blazers last season,
signed a five-month contract, but both sides said he could return
to the NBA on short notice if players and owners settle their labor
dispute.
	   His first game is scheduled for Jan. 7 in Belgrade, Yugoslavia,
against Red Star.
	   On Monday, free agent center Vlade Divac signed with Yugoslav
champion Red Star Belgrade in a deal with a similar provision that
would allow him to return to the NBA.
	   Divac, who played for the Charlotte Hornets last season, will
play only in Red Star's Euro League games, not its Yugoslavian
league games. Agent Mark Fleischer said Divac would play a maximum
of 12 games for Red Star.
	   If there is no agreement to end the lockout by Jan. 7, Divac
will start opposite Sabonis in a Euro League match against Zalgiras
in Belgrade.
	   Divac, a Yugoslav, told the daily newspaper Politika he rejected
a much better financial offer to play for Kinder Bologna and opted
for the Belgrade team because of patriotic reasons.
	   ``Vlade did not do this for money,'' said Fleischer, who refused
to divulge terms of Divac's contract. ``He was going to be in
Yugoslavia anyway, and he does not want Red Star to finish last in
its division. If it does, it loses its spot in the Euro League.''

Iraqi Kurds to launch Kurdish TV; broadcasts would reach Turkey
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ISTANBUL, Turkey (AP) _ An Iraqi Kurdish group said Tuesday it
will launch a new Kurdish satellite television outfit whose
transmissions will also reach Turkey, where broadcasting in the
Kurdish language is banned.
	   The Kurdistan Democratic Party plans to present both cultural
and political programs in what would be the world's second Kurdish
television station.
	   The KDP controls about two-thirds of northern Iraq. The de facto
Kurdish autonomous zone has been in place there since the 1990-91
Gulf War.
	   ``We need a news alternative, other sources of information for
the Kurds,'' said Faik Nerweyi, a representative of the Kurdish
party in Ankara, Turkey's capital.
	   The channel so far has broadcast only short programs as tests
but should be ready for full broadcast soon, Nerweyi said.
	   The other satellite television broadcasting in Kurdish is the
London-based MED TV.
	   MED TV was cautioned twice this year by Britain's television
watchdog for showing bias toward the Kurdistan Workers Party, or
PKK, which has been fighting for autonomy in southeast Turkey for
more than a decade.
	   Broadcasting in Kurdish is still illegal in Turkey. Authorities
in the southeast have cracked down on satellite dish owners, whose
dishes are turned so as to receive MED TV.
	   Ankara has also been pressuring European countries to ban the
Kurdish television.
	   On Tuesday, one official dismissed the upcoming premier of the
Iraqi Kurd station.
	   ``We cannot interfere with other countries' choice of broadcast
language. It is not our concern,'' said Haldun Otman, a spokesman
of the Turkish Foreign Ministry.
	   The KDP fights alongside the Turkish army in Iraq against the
PKK rebels. However, Turkey opposes any move that might create a
Kurdish state in Iraq, fearing it would inspire the rebellion of
the PKK.

Israeli general says it's `unnatural' for women to be pilots
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with comment from army spokesman, grafs 6-7, ADDS

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ An Israeli air force general told a
parliamentary committee that it was ``unnatural'' for women to be
pilots, sparking outrage among female legislators.
	   Legislator Marina Solodkin, who chairs the Committee on the
Status of Women, said Tuesday that the comments showed that the air
force has not changed its attitude toward women despite some
reforms.
	   Last year, Israel's Supreme Court ordered the air force to
change its policy of training only men as pilots and to admit women
to the course. Later this week, one of the new recruits is to
complete a combat navigation course, the first woman to reach such
an advanced stage of training.
	   The latest controversy began Monday when Brig. Gen. Gil Regev
told Solodkin's committee that women don't have the stamina to be
pilots and that the job interferes with child-rearing.
	   ``I'm concerned about the survival rate of the female
soldiers,'' Solodkin quoted Regev as saying. ``I also think it's
not natural for there to be female pilots.''
	   The army spokesman's office said Tuesday that the air force is
implementing the Supreme Court decision allowing women to train as
pilots.
	   ``On Thursday, for the first time, a female candidate will
successfully complete the course,'' the spokesman said.

The battles around Podujevo: preparations for the spring
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With Yugoslavia-Kosovo &QL;

<TEXT>
	   PODUJEVO, Yugoslavia (AP) _ The snowy hills of northern Kosovo,
where village kids used to engage in marathon snowball fights, have
turned into a much crueler battlefield at the end of the bloodiest
year in recent Kosovo's history.
	   Now it's the parents, not the kids, in the hills, some in the
uniform of the ethnic Albanian guerrillas fighting for Kosovo's
independence from Serbia.
	   Clashes that erupted Christmas Eve around the town of Podujevo
added at least another 15 people to the more than 1,000 dead in
Kosovo since February, leading observers fearing of an avalanche of
violence to come next spring.
	   ``Winter is the time when snowballs start rolling and growing so
big that they get out of control,'' says William Walker, the
American head of the international observer team hoping to cap the
violence. ``I hope that's not the case.''
	   Walker says the unarmed verification force - now 700-strong and
set to be increased to 2,000 in the coming weeks - will not be
pulled out despite the increased danger posed by the upward spiral
of bloodshed.
	   ``We have to do whatever we can to stop violence, that's what
we're here for,'' Walker told The Associated Press.
	   Still, the fierce battles around Podujevo, about 32 kilometers
(20 miles) north of the provincial capital Pristina, show that
unarmed observers may not be enough to end the fighting between
government forces and the Kosovo Liberation Army, which is battling
for independence from Serbia, the main Yugoslav republic.
	   After a string of major defeats elsewhere, the guerrillas appear
to have reorganized and increased their presence in the Podujevo
area in the wake of an Oct. 12 truce negotiated by Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic and U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke that
ended seven months of fighting.
	   According to Fehim Rexhepi, an ethnic Albanian journalist who
reports on the rebels, there are between 2,000 and 3,000 KLA
soldiers and their armed supporters in the Podujevo region, home to
about 20,000 ethnic Albanian villagers spread across 15 scattered
settlements.
	   ``They are more disciplined, better equipped and prepared for
any battle than several months ago,'' Rexhepi says.
	   And he said total KLA strength has grown to about 6,000
province-wide since the Oct. 12 agreement.
	   Many of the snowed-in villages in the Podujevo area are deserted
in the wake of the latest fighting, except for KLA men in uniform,
who hide behind trees or in wrecked houses, fingering triggers of
their sniper or semiautomatic rifles. They are particularly strong
in Lapastica, now sheltering hundreds of refugees of nearby
burned-out villages.
	   In Podujevo, 2 kilometers (little more than 1 mile) to the
northeast of Lapastica, Serbs are anxious, whether they are among
the refugees who fled homes now in rebel-held territory to the west
of the town or the few permanent residents still holding out
despite the closeness of the rebels.
	   If the KLA takes Podujevo, near the northern border of Kosovo,
it can control traffic between Pristina and central Serbia. KLA
trenches already are only a few hundred meters (yards) away from
the 30-kilometer (20-mile) road linking Pristina with Podujevo.
	   ``The KLA will do everything to keep these positions,'' Rexhepi
forecasts.
	   In Podujevo, Srboslav Bisercic, a local official, says that
fellow Serbs now account for less than 3 percent of the 20,000
people remaining here. Another 10,000, mostly Serbs, have left for
safer regions. ``Soon there will be no Serbs here unless the state
... finishes off these bandits and savages,'' he tells a visitor
angrily.
	   A group of grim-looking men nearby smoke nervously as they wait
to hear news of how a Serb police evacuation effort in rebel-held
territory is going.
	   ``My mother and father are there,'' says one of the Serbs,
refusing to give his name . ``They wouldn't listen to me when I
told them to evacuate in time.''
	   Another curses the West for what he perceived as the latest
manifestation of an anti-Serb conspiracy _ the NATO threat to
attack that forced authorities to call off the crackdown on the
rebels in October and allowed the rebels to regroup.
	   ``Our hands are tied, the world is against us,'' he says.

Forget genocide, we're sorry, Khmer Rouge leaders say

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Saying they were ``very sorry'' but
refusing to accept responsibility, two top Khmer Rouge leaders
asked Cambodians to ``let bygones be bygones'' Tuesday and forget
about the genocide of the 1970s.
	   Khieu Samphan and Nuon Chea were flown by helicopter from a
former rebel stronghold to the capital to defect _ in effect,
surrender _ to Prime Minister Hun Sen after he pledged they would
not face trial for crimes against humanity.
	   At a news conference, they were asked by journalists _ many of
them Cambodians who lost family members _ if they felt any remorse
for causing the deaths of as many as 2 million of their countrymen.
	   ``Yes, sorry, very sorry,'' Khieu Samphan said, looking red and
sullen.
	   ``We would like to apologize and ask our compatriots to forget
the past so our nation can concentrate on the future,'' Khieu
Samphan said. ``Let bygones be bygones.''
	   The Maoist revolutionaries won a civil war in 1975 and forced
the population into slave labor camps. One Cambodian in five
perished from overwork, starvation, disease and executions.
	   Khieu Samphan called the nightmare _ laid out in his doctoral
thesis as a communist student in Paris in 1959 _ a ``historical
experiment.''
	   The Khmer Rouge were overthrown in 1979 by a Vietnamese
invasion, but spent two decades waging civil war. Stalemate ended
in 1996 when the government began offering pardons to leaders and
guerrillas to get them to make peace.
	   With the movement all but extinct, calls are being heard for
someone to finally be held accountable.
	   The defections of Khieu Samphan and Nuon Chea have no bearing on
the military situation. Only one leader, Ta Mok, remains at large
with an estimated 100 loyalists.
	   Hun Sen's reversal of previous support for a tribunal and the
warm reception given the Khmer Rouge leaders was met with shock by
the human rights group Amnesty International.
	   ``It's a black day for the Cambodian people and a black day for
international justice,'' group representative Demelza Stubbings
said.
	   Khieu Samphan was the nominal Khmer Rouge leader, though he is
viewed as a front-man for the notorious Pol Pot and others who held
real power. Nuon Chea was seen as Pol Pot's second-in-command and
chief theorist. Pol Pot died in April of a heart attack.
	   Neither accepted personal responsibility Tuesday at the news
conference before as hostile an audience as they are ever likely to
face now that a trial is out.
	   Demands were shouted by some reporters for personal apologies to
the families of those who perished.
	   Nuon Chea, asked who was to blame for the massacres, said:
``Let's consider that an old issue. I cannot clarify that.''
	   ``We are very sorry, not just for the human lives, but also
animal lives that were lost in the war,'' Nuon Chea said.
	   Khieu Samphan indicated there would be no trial, especially one
abroad by an international tribunal. The United Nations recently
sent a team of experts to weigh the possibility of such a court.
	   ``Please let the Cambodian people resolve this problem,'' Khieu
Samphan said.
	   ``If we have to say who was wrong and who was right, etc., etc.,
we cannot have national reconciliation,'' Khieu Samphan said. ``We
cannot put an end to the war.''
	   Neither looked well after months on the run when rebel areas
came under government control. Nuon Chea, 71, walked with a cane.
Khieu Samphan, 67, needed help up the stairs.
	   Khieu Samphan's normally white hair was dyed black in an
apparent attempt at disguise.
	   In the five-hours meeting with Hun Sen, they were joined by
leading members of the Cambodian People's Party. Like Hun Sen, many
were once Khmer Rouge cadres before fleeing murderous purges in the
late 1970s.
	   The pair later called on Prince Norodom Ranariddh, president of
the National Assembly and son of King Norodom Sihanouk. Hun Sen
says that both have approved the defections.
	   It was Nuon Chea's first visit to the capital since the Khmer
Rouge were overthrown in 1979 by a Vietnamese invasion.
	   Khieu Samphan came to Phnom Penh in 1991 after a peace treaty _
later broken by the Khmer Rouge _ was signed. He was stoned by a
Hun Sen-controlled mob.

U.S. businessman charged with channeling money to Hamas
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIT EL, West Bank (AP) _ An Israeli military court on Tuesday
charged a Palestinian American businessman with funneling money to
the Islamic militant group Hamas.
	   The court said the money went to Adel Awadallah, a top Hamas
fugitive and mastermind of suicide bombings in Israel. Awadallah
was killed in an Israeli commando raid in September.
	   The defendant, Jamil Sarsour, denied any connection to Hamas.
	   ``I only made a small contribution to the family (of Awadallah),
that's all I did,'' Sarsour, a resident of the West Bank town of
Ramallah, said on Israel army radio.
	   Sarsour's hometown in the United States was not immediately
available.
	   The indictment said Sarsour channeled funds to Hamas from the
United States, using an Israeli bank account. The money was cashed
by a 70-year-old woman and was transferred to Awadallah.
	   Awadallah also asked Sarsour to get him a false passport or
other identification that would enable him to flee the country.
	   ``From the investigation it became clear that Awadallah felt the
ring tighten around him,'' the military prosecutor, Sgt. Eli Baon,
said on the radio.
	   Sarsour did not get Awadallah a passport, but did provide him
with other false papers, the radio said.
	   The military court spokesman was not immediately available for
comment.

<TEXT>
	   SAN`A, Yemen (AP) _ Two British men and an American woman were
killed Tuesday when Yemeni security forces stormed the hideout of
Islamic militants who had kidnapped 16 foreign tourists, a Yemeni
security official said.
	   The other 13 hostages were freed, but three suffered injuries in
the shootout between the security forces and the militants, the
official said.
	   Two of the kidnappers and a policeman also died in the clash,
and one kidnapper and three policemen were wounded, the official
said.
	   He said that two British men and an Australian man were wounded.
Names were not immediately available.
	   Helicopters were dispatched to the area to evacuate the injured,
said the security official, speaking on customary condition of
anonymity.
	   The kidnapping happened Monday near the southern town of
Mawdiyah, about 200 kilometers (175 miles) south of the Yemen
capital San`a.
	   The hostages included 12 Britons _ six of them women _ two
American women and two Australian men.
	   They were taken when 18 men ambushed a convoy of five vehicles
in which the tourists were traveling and opened fire on their
police escorts. The kidnappers threatened to kill the tourists if
the police did not back off.
	   During the melee, the British tour leader and a Yemeni guide
escaped and raised the alarm.
	   Kidnapping of tourists by tribes is a commonly used method in
Yemen to gain concessions from the government such as new roads,
water supply or clinics. The hostages generally are released
unharmed.
	   But the latest incident marked the first time an abduction was
carried out by Islamic militants. Security officials said the
kidnappers belong to Islamic Jihad, many of whose leaders fought in
Afghanistan and are believed to have connections with Egyptian
Muslim radicals.
	   Earlier Tuesday, Yemeni officials began negotiations with the
Islamic militants for the release of the tourists. Some 200 Yemeni
security forces encircled the area.
	   Gov. Ahmad Ali Mohsen of Abyan province, where the kidnapping
took place, was leading the talks with leaders of the Al-Fadl
tribe, to which the kidnappers belong, an official at the
governor's office said.
	   Mohsen was accompanied by Islamic figures who are influential
with the abductors, the official said, speaking on condition of
anonymity.
	   The kidnappers demanded the release of their leader, Saleh
Haidara al-Atwi, who was arrested two weeks ago as part of a
government crackdown on Islamic vigilantes enforcing strict Islamic
rules in southern Yemen.
	   The kidnappers also wanted the release of another leader, Yemen
security officials said. They did not identify him.
	   They said Islamic Jihad members flogged women for ignoring the
Islamic dress code and men for selling and drinking alcohol, which
is forbidden in Islam.
	   The group, which has no more than 200 members, also ran a
military camp in southern Yemen, the security officials said.
	   Yemen was once a haven for Islamic militant fugitives from other
countries, but the government has expelled many of them.
	   A British couple and their teen-age son were kidnapped in April
but released unharmed a month later.
	   Four Germans currently are being held by a tribe in northeast
Yemen. The kidnappers are demanding more schools, hospitals and
telephone lines in their area.

Russia delivers second submarine to China
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia has delivered a new submarine to China _
the second of the same class in as many years, a news agency
reported on Tuesday.
	   The Project 636 diesel-electric submarine, known as Kilo-class
in the West, has sailed to Finland where it's being put aboard a
cargo ship that will bring it to China, the ITAR-Tass news agency
reported.
	   A submarine of that class can carry a total of 18 torpedoes and
costs about dlrs 300 million on the world market.
	   In the past, China bought two submarines of an earlier version
from Russia, ITAR-Tass said.
	   China has evolved as a major customer for the ailing Russian
defense industry, also purchasing fighter jets, missiles and
destroyers.
	   China threatens to use force to assert its claim of sovereignty
over Taiwan. Its fleet of submarines, including advanced Kilo-class
subs, would be key to enforcing a blockade of the island. Taiwan
has just two modern submarines.

Armenian parliament approves 1999 budget
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   YEREVAN, Armenia (AP) _ The Armenian parliament approved a draft
1999 budget Tuesday that forecasts a deficit of 5.1 percent of the
gross domestic product _ or nearly one-quarter of budget spending.
	   Parliament voted 122-22 to approve the budget, which projects
spending of 248.3 billion drams (477 million dollars) and revenues
of 191.7 billion drams (dlrs 368 million).
	   Armenia plans to issue treasury bills for 3.6 billion drams
(dlrs 7 million) to cover part of the 56.6 billion drams (dlrs 110
million) deficit.
	   The rest of the deficit will be covered by international loans,
which are expected to total dlrs 112.8 million next year, with most
of the money coming from the World Bank.
	   Prime Minister Armen Darbinian said 1999 wouldn't be an easy

	   He warned that ``the world financial crisis has not been
overcome yet, so it wouldn't be realistic to expect sharp economic
growth in Armenia.''
	   Unlike many other former Soviet republics, Armenia hasn't
suffered much from the economic crisis in Russia, because economic
ties between the two countries have been declining in recent years.

Minister: New Kuwait oil fields can be developed in five years
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUWAIT (AP) _ Kuwait's northern oil fields could be developed
and operated by interested foreign companies for about dlrs 7
billion in five years, the oil minister said in remarks published
Tuesday.
	   The minister, Sheik Saud al-Sabah, told local newspaper editors
on Monday that the operation agreements Kuwait was seeking with
American and British companies would double production from these
fields to more than 900,000 barrels a day.
	   No contracts or memorandums of understanding have yet been
signed with any companies, the minister said.
	   But the firms approached by Kuwait have reacted positively and
they believe Kuwait's proposal is ``unique,'' he added. His remarks
were reported Tuesday by the state-run Kuwait News Agency.
	   The minister stressed Kuwait's project was not a
production-sharing agreement, which is banned by the constitution.
He said foreign companies will not be allowed to own ``a single
drop,'' of Kuwaiti oil.
	   The companies will be paid fees for their services, and will buy
the oil they produce. Also, they will build a new port and a city
for their employees, Sheik Saud said.
	   Kuwait's oil sector is owned and run by the government. A number
of parliament members are worried that opening the door for foreign
companies would eventually lead to loss of control over the
country's oil, the mainstay of its economy.
	   Sheik Saud said the agreements were necessary to ``prepare for
the future,'' and benefit from technologies that are not for sale.
	   In addition to that, the development of the northern oil fields
was a ``strategic'' goal, he said. The fields are close to the
border with Iraq, which invaded Kuwait and occupied it for seven
months before a U.S.-led coalition evicted Iraqi forces in February
1991.

	   KARACHI, Pakistan (AP) _ Armed rioters blocked roads and set
ablaze at least four vehicles Tuesday in the violence-plagued port
of Karachi in demonstrations over the government's campaign to
destroy shanties in a neighborhood dominated by militants.
	   Masked armed men also exchanged heavy gunfire with security
forces in the central Liquatabad area, but there were no immediate
reports of causalities, witnesses said.
	   The police and paramilitary rangers surrounded the troubled
neighborhood as rampaging rioters hurled gasoline bombs at
vehicles.
	   The violence was prompted by the government's efforts to destroy
what is says are shanties built without permission on
government-owned land in the nearby neighborhood of Gharibabad,
considered a stronghold of the militant ethnic Muttehida Qami
Movement (MQM).
	   The authorities have bulldozed dozens of shanties in the
low-income area, saying the structures provide shelter to
``terrorists and criminals.''
	   Also on Tuesday, Karachi police found the bullet-riddled body of
an unidentified young man, bearing marks of torture.
	   Karachi has been under direct federal rule since Prime Minister
Nawaz Sharif's government dismissed the Sindh provincial government
in October, saying it failed to maintain peace in this beleaguered
city of 14 million people. About 1,000 people have died this year
in the factional fighting.
	   Sharif has blamed the MQM, a former ally, for most of the
bloodletting in Karachi and set up military courts last month to
try those accused in killings.
	   The MQM, which represents Urdu-speaking people who migrated from
British India at independence in 1947, denies the accusations and
alleges the government is engaging in ``state sponsored terrorism''
against its ethnic group.
	   The government says it has only targeted ``criminals.''
	   MQM spokesman Farooq Sattar told reporters that Tuesday's
demonstrations were a ``natural reaction'' to the razing of houses
in the Gharibabad neighborhood.
	   ``More than 300 houses have been demolished in Gharibabad
without any prior notice. These people were living there for the
last 40 years. The action is targeted only against the MQM
supporters,'' Sattar said.
	   Sattar said the action was ``undemocratic and violated basic
human rights'' and appealed to the president and army chief of the
staff to take up the issue with the government.
	   There was no immediate comment from the government.

Dutch official: video refs could prevent crowd trouble
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) _ The Dutch government wants to
study the use of instant replays to rule on controversial calls and
prevent crowd trouble during the Euro 2000 championships, an
official studying anti-hooliganism measures claimed in an article
released Tuesday.
	   ``If technology can limit the number of questionable decisions
by referees, that will lead to less emotion among supporters and
hooliganism will decline,'' said Henk Mannen, the head of a Euro
2000 team at the Dutch Ministry of Health, Welfare and Sport.
	   ``It would therefore be useful to get all those involved around
a table to discuss technological support for referees,'' he added
in the article, a copy of which was released Tuesday.
	   Many of the worst hooligan incidents at this year's World Cup
occurred before kickoff however and experts have long doubted the
influence of the match itself on soccer violence. There was
virtually no crowd trouble inside grounds during World Cup matches
in France despite a slew of controversial calls.
	   The Netherlands and Belgium are jointly hosting the 16-team
European championships from June 10 to July 2, 2000, the first time
such a major soccer tournament has been held in two countries.
Civil servants in both nations are already considering ways of
preventing crowd trouble from marring the tournament.
	   Belgium's worst hooligan incident happened at Brussels' Heysel
in 1985, when 39 fans were crushed to death, trying to escape
fighting before the European Champions' Cup final between Juventus
Turin and FC Liverpool.
	   In March 1997 an Ajax Amsterdam fan was beaten to death by
supporters of Feyenoord Rotterdam during a battle organized by the
rival fans well away from any heavily-policed soccer stadium.
	   Euro 2000 organizers are expecting 1.2 million fans to buy
tickets for the championships' 31 matches.
	   Nobody at European soccer's governing body, UEFA, was
immediately available for comment, but during the World Cup finals,
UEFA President Lennart Johansson said all available resources
should be used to get calls right.
	   ``We have to see about using modern technology in the matches,''
he said. ``We can't go too far. We don't want the referee running
to the TV screen all the time. The match would take nine hours.''
	   Sepp Blatter, the president of world soccer's ruling body FIFA,
adamantly opposes the use of instant replays.

Maier leads Austrian sweep in fourth season downhill
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Ams. RECASTS, UPDATES with detail, quotes &QL; 
 &UR; By PIERO VALSECCHI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BORMIO, Italy (AP) _ Austrian ski superstar Hermann Maier
captured his first downhill victory since his dramatic and
spectacular spill at the Nagano Olympics -- and he did it in style.
	   ``The Herminator'' overpowered the opponents in Tuesday's World
Cup speed race on a icy and twisty course as he led an impressive
1-6 sweep by Austrian skiers in the last Alpine event of the year.
	   ``You need courage to win on this course. I was brave and I took
a lot of risks to clinch this victory. I really wanted a downhill
win after Nagano,'' the 26-year-old ace from Flachau said.
	   At Nagano last February Maier crashed at high speed off the
course during the Olympic downhill but recovered quickly from
bruises and back pains to clinch the Super-G and giant slalom
titles.
	   The defending World Cup champion reached peak speed of up to 123
kph as he mastered the 3,070-meter-long Stelvio course in the
winning time of one minute, 54.51 seconds in a repeat of last
year's triumph in this Italian alpine resort.
	   It was the 14th World Cup career victory _ the fourth of this
season _ for the Austrian ace, who exploded to international fame
last season by winning the World Cup overall, Super-G and giant
slalom titles and the two Olympic golds.
	   Maier also earned Austria the first downhill victory on the
men's circuit in the fourth speed race of the 1998-99 campaign.
	   Fritz Strobl and Stephan Eberharter placed second and third
respectively, to complete the all-Austrian podium of strongly-built
heavyweights.
	   Strobl trailed Maier by 0.70 seconds. Eberharter, who earned the
second podium finish of his career in downhill, had a gap of 1.28
seconds.
	   ``I was close to Maier's time in the upper part but he was
definitely faster in the bottom,'' said Strobl. ``I must
congratulate him for a great performance. I'm overjoyed with my
second place.''
	   Three other Austrians _ Hans Knauss, Werner Franz and Hannes
Trinkl _ placed from fourth to sixth in an unprecedented 1-6 finish
in men's downhill.
	   Six French women placed 1-6 in a World Cup downhill at Abetone,
Italy, in 1968.
	   Austrian skiers already had set an all-time World Cup record by
sweeping the top nine places in a Super-G race at Innsbruck last
week.
	   Swiss Bruno Kernen, the defending world downhill champion, was
the first non-Austrian finisher in seventh place, 1.99 seconds
behind.
	   Maier, nervous and tense before the start, piled up a decisive
advantage in the bottom section of the course, on which most skiers
made mistakes due to fatigue.
	   Some, including American Chad Fleischer, fell exhausted after
crossing the finish line.
	   ``It was a tough, difficult race. I attacked throughout and only
had problems at a jump. It's a great victory,'' said Maier, who is
headed to succeed retired Alberto Tomba as No.1 on the world ski
circuit.
	   Maier, who had captured two Super-Gs and one giant slalom
earlier this season, strengthened his overall lead in the Cup
standings by pocketing 100 points, for a total of 640 after 13
events.
	   His closest rival, Norwegian Lasse Kjus, was sidelined with
bronchitis and did not start in Bormio.
	   The Norwegian still held second place overall with 537 points
and the lead in the downhill standings with 280 points, 70 ahead of
Maier.
	   Kjus dominated the two first season downhills in Val D'Isere and
Val Gardena and placed second to Italy's Kristian Ghedina in the
third.
	   Kjetil Aandre Amodt, another leading Norwegian skier, and
injured Olympic downhill champion Jean-Luc Cretier of France were
also missing at Bormio, the site of the 1985 world championships
which will host the World Cup finals in 2000.
	   Ghedina was a distant 19th, 3.45 second slower than the winner.
	   The men's World Cup continues at Kranjska Gora, Slovenia, with a
slalom and a giant slalom, on Jan. 5-6.

Israeli general says it's `unnatural' for women to be pilots
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By LAURIE COPANS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ An Israeli air force general told a
parliamentary committee that it was ``unnatural'' for women to be
pilots, sparking outrage among female legislators.
	   Legislator Marina Solodkin, who chairs the Committee on the
Status of Women, said Tuesday that the comments showed that the air
force has not changed its attitude toward women despite some
reforms.
	   Last year, Israel's Supreme Court ordered the air force to
change its policy of training only men as pilots and to admit women
to the course. Later this week, one of the new recruits is to
complete a combat navigation course, the first woman to reach such
an advanced stage of training.
	   The latest controversy began Monday when Brig. Gen. Gil Regev
told Solodkin's committee that women don't have the stamina to be
pilots and that the job interferes with child-rearing.
	   ``I'm concerned about the survival rate of the female
soldiers,'' Solodkin quoted Regev as saying. ``I also think it's
not natural for there to be female pilots.''
	   The army spokesman's office said Tuesday that the air force is
implementing the Supreme Court decision allowing women to train as
pilots.
	   ``On Thursday, for the first time, a female candidate will
successfully complete the course,'' the spokesman said.
	   Solodkin said the air force apparently was reluctant to change.
	   ``They show unwillingness to accept the women as equals to
men,'' Solodkin said. ``This is unprofessional because they don't
even see the advances of women in other countries in this field.''
	   In Israel, women are drafted for nearly two years while men do
three years of compulsory service. However, women mostly serve in
clerical jobs and rarely hold command positions.
	   In a landmark ruling in 1995, the Supreme Court overturned an
army policy that barred women in combat. Two years ago, the court
ordered the air force to accept women in its courses and the first
women were accepted last year.

	   TOKYO (AP) _ Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi and a key opposition
leader agreed Tuesday to keep working toward a coalition
government, although they were unable to overcome differences that
still threaten to end talks.
	   Obuchi and Liberal Party leader Ichiro Ozawa tentatively agreed
in November to work toward a coalition government _ a critical move
in efforts by Obuchi's Liberal Democratic Party to secure its hold
on power.
	   ``If our policies and views are not realized, then I'd like to
scrap our initial agreement,'' Ozawa told reporters after a
late-night meeting at the prime minister's residence.
	   Despite the words of warning, both sides confirmed their
commitment to keep trying. Party negotiators have been haggling for
days; their main sticking point has been defense policy.
	   Ozawa, who defected from the ruling Liberal Democratic Party in
1993 to form a more reform-oriented party, long has pushed for a
new interpretation of the constitution that would increase
participation in U.N. military missions.
	   A Liberal Party official, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said after Tuesday night's meeting that policy differences remain
and that Obuchi and Ozawa did not discuss Cabinet posts. Obuchi has
promised Ozawa a Cabinet post, but it is unclear how long settling
on which one will take.
	   The ruling party lacks a majority in the upper house of
Parliament and needs support from other parties to get bills passed
at a time when public dissent is growing over the nation's ailing
economy.
	   Having Ozawa on board could give markets a lift because he is
seen as more aggressive on tax cuts and other measures aimed at
turning around the economy. Ozawa's presence also could help
Japan's image at a time when Tokyo is under international pressure
to do more to jump-start its economy.

Newspaper: Dugarry will join Juventus after New Year
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MILAN, Italy (AP) _ Marseille striker Christophe Dugarry is
expected to sign with Juventus of Turin in time to start play just
after the start of the new year, Italy's Gazzetta dello Sport
reported Tuesday.
	   Juventus is expected to pay Marseille about dlrs 8.4 million.
	   Juventus coach Marcello Lippi, who watched Dugarry score the
winning goal in a recent match against Lens, has been looking for a
replacement for long-term injury victim Alessandro Del Piero.
	   Press reports linked the Italian champion, languishing in ninth
place in Serie A, with the 26-year-old French international.
	   ``My experiences at AC Milan and Barcelona didn't go as I
wanted. Why not try a third experience abroad?'' Dugarry told
reporters earlier this month. Playing for Juventus ``would be a
fascinating challenge,'' he said.
	   The transaction is expected to be done in time for Dugarry to
face AC Milan in a league match on Jan. 6.

Giant mergers may startle, but big isn't necessarily bad
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ERIC R. QUINONES &QC; 
 &UR; AP Business Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ A few years ago, a merger of Exxon and Mobil
might have seemed as unlikely as, say, a professional wrestler
being elected governor.
	   Now eye-popping mergers of giant corporate rivals are
commonplace. But to anyone who fears that a handful of companies
will soon take over the world, business experts say global
competition is just too strong.
	   ``As big as companies might seem today, actually the large
companies are a smaller fraction of the market than they were 20
and 30 years ago,'' said Jeremy Siegel, professor of finance of the
University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School of Business.
	   The merger frenzy has swept though a variety of industries, with
many companies seeking to expand in the United States, and in
developing Asian and European markets.
	   The quest for size and global reach has been accompanied by a
focus on efficiency and cost-cutting as giant rivals combine and
then slash their overlapping businesses and employees.
	   The oil industry, in particular, has seen huge mergers as
companies look for areas to slash costs and boost profits amid a
deep global slump in prices. Financial institutions are combining
in efforts to provide customers with a broad new array of services
from checking accounts to insurance to investment advice. Since a
1996 law freed local, long-distance and cable companies to pursue
each others' businesses, phone companies have been scrambling to
merge.
	   The result has been an array of mergers creating headlines as
startling as Minnesota Gov. Jesse ``The Body'' Ventura, a former
pro wrestler: namely deals between Exxon and Mobil, Daimler-Benz
and Chrysler, America Online and Netscape Communications, Travelers
and Citicorp, and NationsBank and BankAmerica.
	   ``I've long since gotten over the thought that any deal should
be unthinkable,'' said Herald Ritch, co-head of mergers and
acquisitions at Donaldson, Lufkin and Jenrette.
	   Some companies are trying to restore past dominance, and break
into new markets.
	   AT and T is the best example, as the former long-distance
monopoly has lost half its share of that market since being broken
up by the government in 1984. AT and T is now trying furiously to
crack into the local phone business and is buying cable giant
Tele-Communications Inc. with a plan to one day deliver phone and
Internet services through televisions.
	   While the combination of heavyweights might seem an unfair
concentration of power, government regulators have determined that
big deals do not necessarily create antitrust problems. For
instance, NationsBank was allowed to buy BankAmerica, WorldCom
bought MCI, Boeing bought McDonnell Douglas.
	   But the Washington watchdogs have forced some companies to sell
off piece of themselves if they would dominate specific markets.
	   Exxon and Mobil, for instance, will probably have to sell off
gas stations and refineries in regions where, together, they would
dominate the market.
	   In some cases, the feds have blocked deals entirely in less
competitive industries.
	   In the past year and a half, regulators quashed proposed mergers
between office-products retailers Staples and Office Depot, defense
giants Lockheed Martin and Northrop Grumman, and the nation's top
four drug wholesalers.
	   With Wall Street reviving from its summer slumber and once again
letting companies use their high-priced stocks as currency to
acquire rivals, regulators will have to be prepared for a heavier
onslaught.
	   From electrical utilities to entertainment companies, merger
watchers say the boom will continue as long as the stock market
remains strong. And in the wake of deals such as Daimler-Chrylser,
British Petroleum-Amoco and Deutsche Bank-Bankers Trust, big names
will be coming together on a global scale.
	   Henry Jacoby, a management professor at the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology, pointed to Rupert Murdoch's News Corp.
media conglomerate and U.S. auto giants General Motors and Ford as
companies that could be looking to strengthen their European
operations.
	   ``Let your imagination run,'' said MIT's Jacoby.

Yugoslav foreign minister demands KLA be declared terrorist group
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Yugoslavia's foreign minister
demanded Tuesday that the ethnic Albanian rebel Kosovo Liberation
Army be declared a terrorist organization and its financial
resources in the West be frozen.
	   In a letter to U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan, a copy of
which was faxed to The Associated Press in Belgrade, Zivadin
Jovanovic said that those demands were among key conditions for
achieving peace in the southern Serbian province.
	   Jovanovic accused the KLA of abusing an October agreement
mediated by American diplomats. He claimed the KLA has carried out
1,854 ``terrorist'' attacks in 1998, including 470 attacks since
October agreement. The KLA killed 284 people this year, said
Jovanovic.
	   ``At the time, the escalation of insolent terrorist attacks, the
abuse of reduced presence of the security forces and their
restraint, the abuse of the deployment of Kosovo Verification
Mission, represent the biggest obstacle to the political, peaceful
solution,'' said Jovanovic.
	   In the lengthy letter, Jovanovic listed the weapons obtained by
the rebel Albanian fighters, including US-made large caliber sniper
rifles.
	   Accusing the KLA of links with ``organized international
terrorism,'' Jovanovic called for ``explicit condemnation'' of the
group, efficient cutting off of its resources of financing abroad,
cessation of all contacts with KLA, closing down of the KLA offices
in the West and condemnation of Albania as the groups main base.

Samaranch, Blatter set summit meeting for Jan. 6
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) _ The presidents of the IOC and
soccer's world governing body will meet next week to try to resolve
their differences on the anti-doping fight and other key issues.
	   Juan Antonio Samaranch, president of the International Olympic
Committee, will meet with FIFA president Sepp Blatter at FIFA
headquarters in Zurich on Jan. 6.
	   FIFA said in a statement Tuesday that the agenda includes FIFA's
position on measures to combat doping, the structure of the soccer
tournaments at the 2000 and 2004 Olympics and the creation of a
soccer arbitration panel.
	   The IOC and FIFA, probably the two most powerful bodies in
international sport, have been at odds over the drug problem for
some time.
	   FIFA was one of three Olympic sports federations, along with
those representing tennis and cycling, which expressed reservations
to an IOC resolution on drugs last month.
	   FIFA objected to an agreement calling on all Olympic sports to
impose a minimum two-year suspension for athletes found guilty of
using steroids.
	   FIFA officials questioned whether the penalty was enforceable
and argued that not all drugs on the IOC's banned list have
performance-enhancing qualities for soccer players.
	   Under the resolution, sports which don't comply risk being
dropped from the Olympics.
	   Samaranch said last month that he was confident that FIFA would
sign up to the agreement before the Feb. 2-4 world anti-doping
summit in Lausanne, Switzerland.
	   On another issue that has divided the two organizations, FIFA
has repeatedly rebuffed Samarananch's calls for eligibility rules
for Olympic soccer to be eased or dropped altogether.
	   FIFA, intent on safeguarding the supremacy of its World Cup,
limits the Olympic tournament to players 23 or under. In Atlanta in
1996, FIFA made a slight concession by allowing teams to field
three players over 23.
	   FIFA announced earlier this month that the same rules would
apply for the 2000 Sydney Games, rejecting Samaranch's request for
teams to be allowed to field five players over 23.

Former East German communists want to employ convicted spy
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BERLIN (AP) _ A former communist mole at NATO headquarters,
convicted of spying in 1994, has been reassigned to a
minimum-security prison and may start working in politics,
officials said Tuesday.
	   Rainer Rupp, a West German codenamed Topaz by then-East German
intelligence, confessed immediately after his arrest in 1993 to
having passed on highly sensitive NATO secrets from 1977-1989.
	   He has been serving a 12-year prison term since 1994.
	   Olaf Papesch, spokesman for the Saarland state Justice Ministry,
said Rupp was moved on Monday to a minimum-security facility, which
will allow him to hold an outside job during the day.
	   He said Rupp applied for the transfer after having served a
third of his sentence and it was not opposed by state or federal
prosecutors.
	   In a newspaper interview, Rupp said he wanted to go to work as
an adviser on foreign and security affairs in parliament for the
Party of Democratic Socialism _ successor party to the East German
communists.
	   PDS spokesman Hanno Harnisch said the party liked the idea.
``We're also for it,'' he said. ``Rupp must also be reintegrated
into society.''
	   But the idea of a convicted spy working for the former
communists drew immediate criticism from Germany's conservative
Christian Democrats, with general secretary Angela Merkel saying
the PDS was trying to twist history.
	   Any attempt to compare NATO to institutions of the communist
regime is ``unanswerable historical misrepresentation,'' Merkel
said.
	   Rupp, who worked for former East German spymaster Markus Wolf,
was convicted of handing over sensitive strategy plans, codes and
military preparedness to his communist contacts when he worked at
NATO headquarters in Belgium from 1977 to 1989.
	   One of Germany's most prominent authors, Martin Walser, had
appealed for Rupp to be pardoned in a speech in October, saying
Rupp had spied because he thought he could preserve world peace.

NBA center returns home to play for national champion during

lockout &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: CORRECTS spelling of team to Zalgiris from Zalgiras.
INCORPORATES Lithuania-Sabonis &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   VILNIUS, Lithuania (AP) _ Free agent center Arvydas Sabonis on
Tuesday joined Lithuania's national champion Zalgiris Vilnius and
will play for them in the European league during the NBA lockout.
	   Sabonis, who played for the Portland Trail Blazers last season,
signed a five-month contract, but both sides said he could return
to the NBA on short notice if players and owners settle their labor
dispute.
	   His first game is scheduled for Jan. 7 in Belgrade, Yugoslavia,
against Red Star.
	   On Monday, free agent center Vlade Divac signed with Yugoslav
champion Red Star Belgrade in a deal with a similar provision that
would allow him to return to the NBA.
	   Divac, who played for the Charlotte Hornets last season, will
play only in Red Star's Euro League games, not its Yugoslavian
league games. Agent Mark Fleischer said Divac would play a maximum
of 12 games for Red Star.
	   If there is no agreement to end the lockout by Jan. 7, Divac
will start opposite Sabonis in a Euro League match against Zalgiras
in Belgrade.
	   Divac, a Yugoslav, told the daily newspaper Politika he rejected
a much better financial offer to play for Kinder Bologna and opted
for the Belgrade team because of patriotic reasons.
	   ``Vlade did not do this for money,'' said Fleischer, who refused
to divulge terms of Divac's contract. ``He was going to be in
Yugoslavia anyway, and he does not want Red Star to finish last in
its division. If it does, it loses its spot in the Euro League.''

President signs new pension system into law
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By BEATA PASEK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ President Aleksander Kwasniewski on
Tuesday signed into law the final part of a new pension system to
replace a communist-era program that is going broke.
	   The new system brings Poland in line with Western standards, a
condition for the government's goal of joining the European Union
early next century.
	   Pension reform is ``most urgent and necessary right now,'' Prime
Minister Jerzy Buzek said, adding that the current system would
break down in a few years.
	   Under the new system, workers' pensions are tied to years of
service and paid for by money from workers, employers and private
investment funds. The current state-subsidized system provides
meager payments not directly related to workers' contributions.
	   The new plan doesn't affect people over 50, who will continue to
get the same pension as under the old plan. Workers between ages 30
and 50 can choose between the current state program or the new one.
Workers under 30 come under the new plan.
	   Social security contributions remain at the current level _ 45
percent of the payroll, split equally between employers and
employees. The new plan also sets strict retirement age limits _ 65
for men and 60 for women _ and curtails early retirement. It takes
effect Jan. 1.
	   Mine workers held an underground protest at more than 50 coal
mines in December to oppose the new retirement ages. They demand
preserving their current right to retire after 25 years of service
with a full pension, no matter their age.
	   They contend working in dangerous conditions, such as mining,
lowers the life expectancy below the new retirement age limits.
	   Under an agreement reached last week that brought a suspension
of the mine protests, the government proposed miners would receive
so-called ``bridge'' pensions of 70 percent of their monthly wages
if they retire with 25 years of service before the legal age. They
would receive the regular full pension when they reach the legal
retirement age.
	   Miners' leaders said they must examine the deal before they
decide whether to continue the protest next month. One union called
for Kwasniewski to veto the pension reform bill.

Muslim Brotherhood uses Ramadan banquet as show of strength
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; BY SALAH NASRAWI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ The Muslim Brotherhood is outlawed and many
of its leaders are behind bars. But Egypt's largest fundamentalist
group can still gather hundreds of people at a rally attended even
by members of Egypt's ruling political party.
	   The brotherhood, a secretive band that helped create the modern
Islamic revival, drew the crowd Monday to its annual ``iftar''
banquet, the breaking of the fast during the holy month of Ramadan
when Muslims do not eat or drink during daylight hours.
	   Despite the religious covering for the event, Mamoun el-Hodeiby,
the deputy lead of the movement, concedes it was meant to
demonstrate the brotherhood's popularity.
	   ``This is testimony that everyone recognizes that the
brotherhood is not a marginal organization but a mass movement
which enjoys the trust and confidence of all walks of life,'' he
told The Associated Press on Wednesday.
	   He said the banquet's purpose to involve the group with
opposition parties and ``to try to find solutions for the problems
that inhibit the freedom of political activities.''
	   The brotherhood, founded by Hassan el-Banna in Egypt in 1928,
grew into a vast movement with tens of thousands of supporters in
Egypt and branches throughout the Arab world. It is banned in Egypt
though the group pledges it wants to achieve its goal of strict
Islamic rule only through peaceful means.
	   It was long unofficially tolerated, but since 1995 the
government has clamped down on the group, accusing it of supporting
a violent campaign by Muslim militants to overthrow the secular
government.
	   Addressing the rally Monday in a Cairo hotel, the group's
leader, Mustafa Mashhour, called on the government to lift its ban
on the movement.
	   His call was applauded by shouts of ``Allahu Akbar,'' or ``God
is great,'' by hundreds of bearded men and veiled women, the
group's supporters who strictly speaking cannot legally hold
political meetings.
	   It also received support from leading opposition figures who
said the brotherhood should be accepted as a legal political party.
	   ``The brotherhood is a national movement which has deep roots in
our society,'' Abdel Adhim Manaf, a leader of the pan-Arab
Nasserite Party, said in an interview Tuesday.
	   Manaf attended Monday's banquet as did _ surprisingly _ Hamdi
el-Seyed, a senior member of President Hosni Mubarak's ruling
National Democratic Party.
	   ``All my life I believed that the brotherhood worked for the ...
welfare of this country,'' el-Seyed told the gathering.
	   The brotherhood in Egypt has undergone a split in recent years.
Younger members tried to find a separate, legal political party,
but the government rejected such a move.
	   El-Hodeiby said the brotherhood itself is not giving up its
demand for official recognition as a political party.
	   ``It is our right, and nobody is doing us any favors to let us
function publicly,'' he said.

NATO-led troops help destroying explosive ordnance
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ Italian troops serving in
the NATO-led peacekeeping force in Bosnia are helping the Bosnian
Serb army destroying ammunition and explosives previously collected
from civilians, NATO officials said Tuesday.
	   The goal of the operation, that started a few days ago under the
codename ``Elisa,'' is to dispose of large amounts of ammunition
that has been stockpiled at Bosnian Serb Army sites around their
stronghold of Pale near Sarajevo, said NATO spokesman Maj. Glenn
Chamberlain.
	   The Bosnian Serb army does not have enough ordnance disposal
experts to do the job by itself. NATO has sent two teams to help
destroy ``large amounts'' of ammunition and explosives, Chamberlain

	   Much of the ammunition and explosives are stored in poor
conditions and has been sitting there for some time, he said.

	   SAINT-ETIENNE, France (AP) _ Three Romanian men have been jailed
for a year for robbing soccer fans while posing as police officers
during the World Cup.
	   The thieves, identified as Dimitri Ionita, Florin Popeanu and
Adrian Prodan, were sentenced late Monday night. They are all in
their 30s and known criminals, police said.
	   All three pleaded guilty to robbing fans after stopping them in
the street for what they said were police searches for drugs.
	   Passing themselves off as plain-clothes officers, the thieves
quickly flashed papers which their victims presumed were police
identity cards, the victims said.
	   Arrested June 19 after a match between Spain and Paraguay in
this town in central France, the three men were carrying South
American and Spanish currency.
	   When ordered to identify themselves, they produced false Italian
papers.
	   The men were also banned from returning to France for 10 years.

Sentences suspended for officials already partially pardoned for
</HEADLINE>
anti-Basque 'dirty war' &QL; 
 &UR; By JOHANNA TUCKMAN &QC;

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Spain's constitutional court on Tuesday
suspended the prison sentences of a former minister and his deputy,
six days after they were partially pardoned for involvement in a
``dirty war'' against Basque separatists.
	   Former Interior Minister Jose Barrionuevo and his chief of
security Rafael Vera left the Guadalajara prison, 50 kilometers (30
miles) northeast of Madrid, within two hours of the court's
decision.
	   Both Barrionuevo and Vera were sentenced in July to 10-year
terms for orchestrating the 1983 kidnapping of a French businessman
mistaken for a hitman from the armed Basque separatist group ETA.
	   The court's decision to suspend the sentences pending appeal of
the convictions was a knock-on effect of a partial pardon granted
by the conservative government of Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar
on Wednesday.
	   The pardon reduced the 10-year terms to three years and a half,
and the constitutional court tends to suspend sentences of less
than five years when appeals are pending.
	   Tuesday's decision also affects three other former officials
convicted of the 1983 kidnapping that was the first action
attributed to a death squad calling itself the Anti-terrorist
Liberation Groups, or GAL.
	   Over the next four years, the GAL killed 27 people in a campaign
against ETA. Many of them were mistaken targets.
	   Revelations in the early 1990s linking the government to the
GAL, contributed to the 1996 electoral defeat of Socialist Prime
Minister Felipe Gonzalez after nearly 14 years in office.
	   Gonzalez has denied his government was involved in the GAL and
insisted that Barrionuevo and Vera are innocent victims of an
anti-Socialist conspiracy.
	   Last week's pardon granted by Gonzalez' conservative successor
had earlier prompted the prison authorities to allow the former
minister and his deputy to go home for Christmas.
	   Outside the prison gates, Barrionuevo had told a crowd of
cheering supporters that although delighted with the pardon they
would be seeking recognition of their innocence.
	   ETA has killed nearly 800 people in a 30-year-old drive for an
independent Basque homeland made up of parts of northern Spain
smaller areas of southern France.
	   A cease-fire observed by ETA since September has ushered in
hopes for a negotiated resolution of the conflict.

Russian police look into Central Bank activities
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with reax from former Central Bank chief, context in
new grafs 4-7, CORRECTS official's name in 3rd graf. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russian police are probing the activities of the
Central Bank because of suspicions that up to dlrs 1 billion may
have been misappropriated, the government said Tuesday.
	   The probe spans Central Bank activities since 1992 when Russia
launched market reforms, Interior Minister Sergei Stepashin told a
news conference. He would not give any names or provide additional
details.
	   Saveli Tesis, the ministry's chief investigator overseeing the
probe, indicated that misappropriation of public funds might have
contributed to Russia's economic crisis _ the worst since the 1991
Soviet collapse.
	   The Former Central Bank chief Sergei Dubinin denied any
wrongdoing in an interview with the Echo Moscow radio on Tuesday.
``I'm not guilty of any wrongdoing,''he said.
	   Dubinin was ousted along with Prime Minister Sergei Kiriyenko
for making the Aug. 17 decision to devalue the ruble and default on
some debts that triggered Russia's worst economic crisis since the
Soviet times.
	   During the the past few months, officials have accused Dubinin
and other bank officials of spending the bank's resources on
ambitious construction projects and high salaries to themselves
instead of using them to ensure stability of the currency and
financial markets.
	   No charges have been brought.
	   Discussing other matters, Stepashin said there were 2.5 million
crimes in Russia this year. In 1997, the Interior Ministry
registered some 2.4 million crimes.
	   Russian police have tended to underreport crime to give a better
picture of the law-and-order situation _ a practice President Boris
Yeltsin strongly condemned last week at a meeting with Stepashin.
Stepashin promised to report a realistic figure.
	   Independent analysts say the government reports just a fraction
of the number of crimes committed in Russia.
	   Stepashin said his ministry solved 250,000 economic crimes such
as embezzlement. Some 6,000 officials were caught taking bribes, he
said.

Italian organizers say they're not worried by lawsuit threat from
</HEADLINE>
Cretier &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   VAL GARDENA, Italy (AP) _ Italian organizers insisted Tuesday
they were not responsible for the season-ending knee injury
suffered by Olympic downhill champion Jean-Luc Cretier during a
World Cup race in Val Gardena.
	   They said they were not overly worried about a threatened
lawsuit by the French skier.
	   Cretier, who won the Olympic title in Nagano this year, tore his
left knee ligaments and fractured his left hand following a
high-speed fall in the Dec. 19 speed race in this north Italian
valley.
	   The 32-year-old French skier from La Plagne, who's considering
retirement following the knee injury, was quoted by French media as
saying he was going to sue Italian organizers because the upper
section of the Saslong track was not protected by safety nets.
	   Cretier skidded off the track and fell over a ridge of grass and
snow after falling at a jump.
	   ``We have a clear conscience. We believe we've acted in the best
possible way,'' said Eric Demetz, president of the organizing
committee of Val Gardena, in the Italian Dolomite mountains.
	   Demetz added that nets in the section where Cretier fell could
have created a dangerous obstacle and caused additional risks to
skiers in a discipline which is considered dangerous because of
high speeds.
	   Demetz also said that the race was covered _ as required by the
International Ski Federation _ by a 5 billion lire (dlrs 3.1
million) insurance against possible damage.
	   Cretier was one of the five skiers who suffered season-ending
knee injuries in spills during the back-to-back World Cup downhills
on the icy Saslong track.
	   American Ehlias Louis and Canadian Ed Podivinsky were among the
others.

Government releases AFP correspondent after 20 months in detention
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ASMARA, Eritrea (AP) _ The government has released Ruth Simon,
an Eritrean working for Agence France-Presse, after 20 months in
detention without charge, an official said Tuesday.
	   The official, who asked not to be further identified, said Simon
had benefited from an amnesty but did not provide further details.
	   Simon, the mother of a young child, was at her home in Asmara,
but neither she nor members of her family wanted to comment on her
detention or release.
	   Simon, a veteran of Eritrea's 30-year independence war with
neighboring Ethiopia, was also the chairwoman of Bana, an
association of demobilized women fighters seeking a place for the
female veterans in Eritrean society.
	   She was arrested April 25, 1997 after reporting that President
Isaias Afwerki told a meeting of cadres of the ruling People's
Front for Democracy and Justice that Eritrean rebels were fighting
alongside Sudanese rebels in neighboring Sudan.
	   Afwerki denied making the statement, and officials said Simon
had attended the meeting as a cadre and that it was closed to the
press.
	   Eritrea hosts the National Democratic Alliance, an umbrella
organization of parties and groups opposed to Sudan's National
Islamic Front government.
	   Simon was never charged with any crime during her imprisonment.
	   On Oct. 18, Simon and four other journalists were named
recipients of the International Press Freedom Awards by the New
York-based Committee to Protect Journalists.
	   U.S. first lady Hillary Clinton met Simon at the Bana
headquarters in March 1997 during an African tour.

Maier leads Austrian sweep in fourth season downhill

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BORMIO, Italy (AP) _ Austrian ski superstar Hermann Maier
captured his first downhill victory since his dramatic and
spectacular spill at the Nagano Olympics _ and he did it in style.
	   ``The Herminator'' overpowered the opponents in Tuesday's World
Cup speed race on a icy and twisty course as he led an impressive
1-6 sweep by Austrian skiers in the last Alpine event of the year.
	   ``You need courage to win on this course. I was brave and I took
a lot of risks to clinch this victory. I really wanted a downhill
win after Nagano,'' the 26-year-old ace from Flachau said.
	   At Nagano in February Maier crashed at high speed off the course
during the Olympic downhill but recovered quickly from bruises and
back pains to clinch the Super-G and giant slalom titles.
	   The defending World Cup champion reached peak speed of up to 123
kph (76 mph) as he mastered the 3,070-meter-long (3,359-yard-long)
Stelvio course in the winning time of one minute, 54.51 seconds in
a repeat of last year's triumph in this Italian alpine resort.
	   It was the 14th World Cup career victory _ the fourth of this
season _ for the Austrian ace, who exploded to international fame
last season by winning the World Cup overall, Super-G and giant
slalom titles and the two Olympic golds.
	   Maier also earned Austria the first downhill victory on the
men's circuit in the fourth speed race of the 1998-99 campaign.
	   Fritz Strobl and Stephan Eberharter placed second and third
respectively, to complete the all-Austrian podium of strongly built
heavyweights.
	   Strobl trailed Maier by 0.70 seconds. Eberharter, who earned the
second podium finish of his career in downhill, had a gap of 1.28
seconds.
	   ``I was close to Maier's time in the upper part but he was
definitely faster in the bottom,'' said Strobl. ``I must
congratulate him for a great performance. I'm overjoyed with my
second place.''
	   Three other Austrians _ Hans Knauss, Werner Franz and Hannes
Trinkl _ placed from fourth to sixth in an unprecedented 1-6 finish
in men's downhill.
	   Six French women placed 1-6 in a World Cup downhill at Abetone,
Italy, in 1968.
	   Austrian skiers already had set an all-time World Cup record by
sweeping the top nine places in last week's Super-G race at
Innsbruck.
	   Swiss Bruno Kernen, the defending world downhill champion, was
the first non-Austrian finisher in seventh place, 1.99 seconds
behind.
	   Maier, nervous and tense before the start, piled up a decisive
advantage in the bottom section of the course, on which most skiers
made mistakes due to fatigue.
	   Some, including American Chad Fleischer, fell exhausted after
crossing the finish line.
	   ``It was a tough, difficult race. I attacked throughout and only
had problems at a jump. It's a great victory,'' said Maier, who is
headed to succeed retired Alberto Tomba as No. 1 on the world ski
circuit.
	   Maier, who had captured two Super-Gs and one giant slalom
earlier this season, strengthened his overall lead in the Cup
standings by pocketing 100 points, for a total of 640 after 13
events.
	   His closest rival, Norwegian Lasse Kjus, was sidelined with
bronchitis and did not start in Bormio.
	   The Norwegian still held second place overall with 537 points
and the lead in the downhill standings with 280 points, 70 ahead of
Maier.
	   Kjus dominated the season's first two downhills in Val D'Isere
and Val Gardena and placed second to Italy's Kristian Ghedina in
the third.
	   Kjetil Aandre Amodt, another leading Norwegian skier, and
injured Olympic downhill champion Jean-Luc Cretier of France were
also missing at Bormio, the site of the 1985 world championships
which will host the World Cup finals in 2000.
	   Ghedina was a distant 19th, 3.45 second slower than the winner.
	   The men's World Cup continues at Kranjska Gora, Slovenia, with a
slalom and a giant slalom, on Jan. 5-6.

Poland doesn't fear Belarus-Russia integration plan
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ANDRZEJ STYLINSKI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ With Russia and Belarus signaling a new
union, Poland finds itself once again on the border of Europe's
East-West division.
	   But Polish officials said Tuesday they don't worry about the
Moscow-Minsk agreement signed last week because both countries are
weak and Poland's upcoming membership in NATO means security
against instability from the east.
	   Russian President Boris Yeltsin and his Belarusian counterpart,
Alexander Lukashenko, signed a deal Friday that could lead to the
former Soviet republics becoming a single state _ with a single
currency, parliament and military.
	   The announcement came as Poland continued final preparations to
join the Czech Republic and Hungary in becoming the first former
Soviet bloc countries to gain NATO membership, perhaps as soon as
March.
	   That means Poland would form the NATO border with the new
Russia-Belarus state, if the union makes it through the necessary
legislative and political processes.
	   Most Polish government officials said the economic hardships and
historical ties between Russia and Belarus made such an arrangement
likely as former Soviet states continue to struggle almost eight
years after the breakup of the Soviet Union.
	   ``The move is not a surprise,'' said Foreign Ministry spokesman
Pawel Dobrowolski. He noted Lukashenko and Yeltsin signed similar
agreements in the past that called for harmonizing their policies,
with little effect.
	   ``This is going to take time. Perhaps we will have it some day,
but this is not a threat,'' Dobrowolski said.
	   Poland will be the only NATO member that borders both Russia and
Belarus, which both have warned NATO expansion to the Bug river on
Poland's eastern frontier could lead to a new East-West division.
	   ``It is not a threat for Poland, we hope,'' government spokesman
Jaroslaw Sellin said of the Russia-Belarus pact. ``In NATO, Poland
will feel secure and this is why we are joining this pact.''
	   Some Polish officials hinted that the Russia-Belarus pact could
be in response to the NATO expansion.
	   ``We can assume that everybody is taking part in some kind of
integration in Europe, and hence the Belarusian idea for
integration with Russia,'' Dobrowolski said.
	   He stressed that the initiative came from Lukashenko, known for
his authoritarian rule in Belarus and admiration for the former
Soviet Union.
	   Stefan Niesiolowski, a leader of Poland's ruling, anti-communist
Solidarity movement, said the deal may reflect a longing for the
old Soviet Union among politicians and ordinary people in Russia
and Belarus.
	   ``This is a bad move for us, because it means reconstructing the
Soviet Union to some extent,'' Niesiolowski said, adding that
Soviet rule sought to dominate eastern Europe until its collapse in
1991. ``I hope that as a NATO member, we will be secure.''
	   In Polish newspapers, editorials and commentators noted that
Russia and Belarus had differing and basically incompatible systems
_ Russia being a democracy implementing free market reforms, while
Belarus maintained a communist-style economy.
	   ``As long as those differences exist, further reunification will
remain on paper,'' the Polityka weekly newspaper said in an
editorial Tuesday.

German star take vacation before joining Spurs
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Tottenham has allowed new signing Steffen Freund
to take a two-week vacation before the German international
midfielder plays his first game in the Premier League on Jan. 9.
	   The experienced midfielder has joined Spurs for 750,000 pounds
(dlrs 1.25 million) and is expected to make his debut against
Sheffield Wednesday.
	   Spurs manager George Graham allowed the 28-year-old former
Schalke and Borussia Dortmund player to go ahead with his vacation
plans, which had already been arranged to coincide with the
Bundesliga's annual mid-winter break.
	   ``It will be a couple of weeks before he's here but he'll soon
become a big favorite with the fans,'' Graham said on Tuesday.
	   ``I'm delighted to have signed him and he will be coming here to
do what he is good at _ winning the ball and then passing it.
	   ``There is great enthusiasm running through the side now but we
still need something more to make sure the improvement continues,''
Graham said the day after his team crushed Everton 4-1 with three
goals from striker Chris Armstrong.
	   ``It's something that the top teams like Manchester United,
Arsenal and Chelsea all have, players who dominate the midfield and
make others play.
	   ``This guy has all the experience in the world with Borussia
Dortmund in their European campaigns and with Germany as part of
their squad in Euro 96.''
	   Freund, who has played 21 times for Germany, had to pull out of
last summer's World Cup in France because of a calf muscle injury.

Israel threatens to close Palestinian airport over security
</HEADLINE>
violation
 &UR; By SARI BASHI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israel has threatened to close down the
Palestinian-run Gaza airport over a security violation, an Israeli
official said Tuesday, a move that could further undermine the
already fragile peace process.
	   Palestinian airport workers refused to allow Israeli security
officials to check the identity of passengers who arrived on an
Egyptian plane Sunday afternoon, most of whom worked for the
Palestinian Authority, according to Civilian Airport Authority
Director Nir Yarkoni.
	   ``The Transportation Minister asked me to tell the Palestinians
that if this continues, we won't allow the airport operate,'' he
told The Associated Press.
	   Yarkoni said he conveyed the message in a letter sent Monday to
chairman of the Palestinian Civil Aviation Authority Brig. Gen.
Fayez Zeidan.
	   Zeidan was not immediately available for comment.
	   Israel retains security control over flights arriving to Gaza
International Airport.
	   The airport's opening last month, stipulated by the accords
brokered by U.S. President Bill Clinton at Wye River, Maryland in
October, was hailed by Palestinians as a milestone toward
independence and statehood.
	   Since then, Israel has accused the Palestinians of failing to
contain anti-Israel violence, and has frozen the accords. The
Palestinians, in turn, accuse Israel of reneging on an agreement to
release Palestinians jailed for anti-Israel activities.

Pakistan's forex reserves surge as U.S. returns fighter planes
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; By AMIR ZIA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ The United States returned the
stalled money for the fighter planes ordered by Pakistan, pushing
the country's foreign exchange reserves above dlrs 1 billion for
the first time since the nuclear tests in May, the finance minister
said Tuesday.
	   Washington has returned dlrs 324.6 million for 28 F-16 fighter
planes that Pakistan paid for in 1989 but never received, Ishaq Dar
told reporters.
	   Delivery of the aircraft was stopped after 1990 when the United
States ended all military and humanitarian aid to Pakistan to
protest a program to develop nuclear weapons.
	   A rise in remittances from Pakistani expatriate workers and
export proceeds are also factors for the jump in foreign exchange
reserves, the official said.
	   Pakistan's foreign exchange reserves slumped sharply in the wake
of economic sanctions from the major world powers for its nuclear
tests in response to similar tests by rival India.
	   India also faces sanctions, but its robust economy has not been
affected as much as Pakistan.
	   Pakistan's reserves hovered around dlrs 430 million until
recently, barely enough to meet the country's import bill of three
weeks.
	   The reserves stood at dlrs 1.021 billion by late Monday, Dar
said.
	   ``The government has managed the economy in a reasonably good
manner despite worldwide recession, economic turmoil in South East
Asian countries and contraction of the Japanese economy,'' he said.
	   Pakistan is scrambling to raise funds from global donor agencies
to support its balance-of-payments gap and meet its obligations on
external debt worth dlrs 32 billion.
	   It is negotiating a dlrs 5.5 billion package with the
International Monetary Fund which also includes restricting of debt
from bilateral lenders.
	   The United States has eased sanctions on India and Pakistan and
said it will not oppose new loans to Islamabad from the IMF.
	   ``Pakistan has already paid dlrs 300 million in debt repayments
during the last couple of months and we will continue to meet our
commitments on debt servicing,'' Dar said.
	   ``The worst part of the crisis is over and the country's
economic indicators are showing signs of improvement,'' he added.
	   Pakistan's industrial growth rate was 3.0 percent for the
July-October quarter compared to minus 1.3 percent during the
corresponding period last year, Dar said.
	   Inflation remained relatively low at 6.6 percent during the same
period compared to 10.2 percent a year ago, he added.
	   The trade deficit fell by 46 percent during July-November to
dlrs 554 million from about dlrs 1 billion last year for the same
time span.

Dutch official asks if video refs could prevent crowd trouble
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) _ The Dutch government wants to
study the use of instant replays to rule on controversial soccer
calls and prevent crowd trouble during the Euro 2000 championships,
an official studying anti-hooliganism measures claimed Tuesday.
	   The Netherlands and Belgium are jointly hosting the 16-team
European championships from June 10 to July 2, 2000, the first time
such a major soccer tournament has been held in two countries.
Civil servants in both nations are already considering ways of
preventing crowd trouble from marring the tournament.
	   ``If technology can limit the number of questionable decisions
by referees, that will lead to less emotion among supporters and
hooliganism will decline,'' said Henk Mannen, the head of a Euro
2000 team at the Dutch Ministry of Health, Welfare and Sport.
	   ``It would therefore be useful to get all those involved around
a table to discuss technological support for referees,'' he wrote
in the ministry's in-house magazine, which was released Tuesday.
	   Many of the worst hooligan incidents at this year's World Cup,
however, occurred before kickoff and experts have long doubted the
influence of the match results on soccer violence. There was
virtually no crowd trouble inside grounds during World Cup matches
in France despite a slew of controversial calls.
	   Belgium's worst hooligan incident happened at Brussels' Heysel
in 1985, when 39 fans were crushed to death, trying to escape
fighting before the European Champions' Cup final between Juventus
Turin and FC Liverpool.
	   In March 1997, an Ajax Amsterdam fan was beaten to death by
supporters of Feyenoord Rotterdam during a battle organized by the
rival fans well away from any heavily policed stadium.
	   Euro 2000 organizers are expecting 1.2 million fans to buy
tickets for the championships' 31 matches.
	   Nobody at European soccer's governing body, UEFA, was
immediately available for comment, but during the World Cup finals,
UEFA President Lennart Johansson said all available resources
should be used to get calls right.
	   ``We have to see about using modern technology in the matches,''
he said. ``We can't go too far. We don't want the referee running
to the TV screen all the time. The match would take nine hours.''
	   Sepp Blatter, the president of world soccer's ruling body FIFA,
adamantly opposes the use of instant replays.

Vatican Museums raise entrance fees

	   VATICAN CITY (AP) _ The Vatican Museums, which include access to
the Sistine Chapel, are raising entrance fees from 15,000 lire
(dlrs 9) to 18,000 dire (dlrs 10.90).
	   The Vatican said Tuesday the higher ticket prices will go into
effect on Saturday, the first day in 1999 when the museums are
open.
	   The museums already are one of the most-visited attractions in
Italy, and crowds are expected to grow in the Holy Year in 2000,
when an extra 20 million visitors are expected in Rome.
	   Prices of discount tickets, for religious pilgrims and students,
will rise from 10,000 lire (dlrs 6) to 12,000 lire (dlrs 7.25).
	   Entrance will remain free on the last Sunday of every month,
unless those days correspond with Vatican holidays. Entrance is
also free on Sept. 27, World Tourism Day.
	   The Vatican attributed the rising ticket prices to higher
operating costs.

Israel threatens to close Palestinian airport over security

violation
 &UR; By SARI BASHI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israel has threatened to close down the
Palestinian-run Gaza airport over a security violation, an Israeli
official said Tuesday, a move that could further undermine the
already fragile peace process.
	   Palestinian airport workers refused to allow Israeli security
officials to check the identity of passengers who arrived on an
Egyptian plane Sunday afternoon, most of whom worked for the
Palestinian Authority, according to Civilian Airport Authority
Director Nir Yarkoni.
	   ``The Transportation Minister asked me to tell the Palestinians
that if this continues, we won't allow the airport operate,'' he
told The Associated Press.
	   Yarkoni said he conveyed the message in a letter Monday to
chairman of the Palestinian Civil Aviation Authority Brig. Gen.
Fayez Zeidan.
	   Zeidan was not immediately available for comment.
	   Israel retains security control over flights arriving to Gaza
International Airport.
	   The airport's opening last month, stipulated by the accords
brokered by U.S. President Bill Clinton at Wye River, Maryland in
October, was hailed by Palestinians as a milestone toward
independence and statehood.
	   Since then, Israel has accused the Palestinians of failing to
contain anti-Israel violence, and has frozen the accords. The
Palestinians, in turn, accuse Israel of reneging on an agreement to
release Palestinians jailed for anti-Israel activities.

<TEXT>
	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ A 49-year-old monk on Tuesday was
consecrated bishop by the Roman Catholic Church. He's the first
Swede to hold the post in about 400 years.
	   Anders Arborelius was appointed last month by the Vatican. He
speaks seven languages and spent the past three decades in a
Carmelite convent in southern Sweden.
	   He was born in Switzerland of Swedish parents, and grew up in
the Swedish city of Lund.
	   The 16th century Reformation religious movement changed Sweden
from an almost entirely Catholic country into a Protestant one
where Catholics were banned. Native Swedes were not allowed to be
Catholic until 1860.
	   The Catholic church claims about 165,000 members in Sweden --
about two percent of the population. Most of its priests are
foreign-born, according to the Stockholm diocese, which includes
the whole country.
	   Arborelius replaced Hubertus Brandenburg, a German, who retired
six weeks ago when he turned 75, the usual retirement age for
bishops.

 &UR; By WILL LESTER &QC;

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Former Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell
called the first meeting Tuesday of a panel investigating claims
that bribes helped Salt Lake City win the 2002 Winter Olympic
games.
	   He planned a news conference early this afternoon to discuss the
direction of that investigation.
	   Mitchell, who helped broker a peace accord in Northern Ireland,
was appointed by U.S. Olympic officials last week to head the
investigation. He's also been mentioned as a possible point man in
President Bill Clinton's efforts to avoid impeachment.
	   Accusations of scandal and bribery have rocked the Olympic
movement, prompting the International Olympic Committee to call for
the first inquiry, followed by Salt Lake organizers early this
month asking its independent ethics panel to investigate.
	   The Justice Department is conducting a preliminary review of the
case. And the USOC appointed a five-member panel headed by Mitchell
to look into the bidding process by American cities.
	   The IOC expects to wrap up its own probe by Jan. 23. Salt Lake
organizers, meanwhile, have said its ethics board would report its
findings no later than Feb. 11.
	   Any delays would likely irritate sponsors who pay an increasing
percentage of the multimillion-dollar sports budget and have told
Olympic brass they want the controversy dealt with swiftly.
	   Olympic officials have been contacting sponsors to assure them
action is being taken to maintain the Olympics image of high ideals
and ethics.

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraq is challenging the no-fly zones
patrolled by the United States and Britain by flying its aircraft
there, Vice President Taha Yassin Ramadan said Tuesday.
	   During an interview with Associated Press Television News,
Ramadan was asked if Iraq was flying its own aircraft in the no-fly
zones. He replied: ``We are doing it right now.''
	   ``Iraqi planes in effect are flying in a normal manner in Iraqi
airspace,'' he said.
	   Ramadan's announcement came a day after U.S. planes fired on an
anti-aircraft battery in the northern no-fly zone. Iraq says four
soldiers were killed. The United States says its planes fired in
self-defense after coming under Iraqi missile attack.
	   The United States and its allies set up the no-fly zones in
northern and southern Iraq to protect Kurdish and Shiite Muslim
rebels from Saddam's forces.
	   ``The so-called air exclusion zones exist only in the sick
imagination of the British and American administrations,'' Ramadan
said.
	   He did not specify whether the Iraqi aircraft flying in the
zones were military or civilian, but almost all of Iraq's passenger
aircraft are either out of the country or unusable.
	   Ramadan's statements came on a day when U.S. and British jets
were not in the air in the north.
	   Lt. Col. Jane Rinell, spokeswoman for the Northern Watch
operation at Incirlik airbase in Turkey, said allied planes ``did
not fly today strictly due to the weather and nothing else.''

	   The introduction of the euro, a common currency for 11 countries
in Europe, on Jan. 4 will bring several changes to two AP financial
market fixtures. Here's a rundown:
	    &UR; FOREIGN CURRENCY TABLES &QC; 
	   Starting with tables produced Monday, Jan. 4, quotes for the ECU
and its forward contracts will be listed as euro. This item is
slugged BC-US-Foreign Exchange and moves to all points.
	   The currencies from the 11 participating countries will still
appear in the table. There will be a three-year transition period
during which euros and the existing national currencies will both
be recognized as legal tender.
	   However, during this time, the national currencies from the 11
countries will be locked to the euro, meaning that they will move
in unison against the dollar and other currencies as the euro does.
	   The 11 countries launching the euro are Austria, Belgium,
Ireland, Italy, Finland, France, Germany, Luxembourg, the
Netherlands, Spain and Portugal.
	    &UR; FOREIGN STOCK TABLES &QC; 
	   Starting Jan. 4, tables that show the prices of stocks traded in
the 11 countries using the euro will be quoted in euros. This item
is slugged BC-Europe Markets, which moves to subscribers in Europe
and Latin America.
	   The list that moves Dec. 31 will contain the current stock price
and the previous stock price in the existing currency. The list
that moves Jan. 4 will have both prices in euros.
	   The exchanges affected are: Amsterdam, Brussels, Frankfurt,
Madrid, Milan, Paris. Exchanges in the list that won't be changing
are: Johannesburg, London, Stockholm and Zurich.

Ugandan, Rwandan presidents meet; deny reports of fighting
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS and LEADS with 10 grafs to update with statement
following meeting &QL; 
 &UR; By HENRY WASSWA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KAMPALA, Uganda (AP) _ The presidents of Uganda and Rwanda
agreed Tuesday that their forces in eastern Congo to support a
rebellion against President Laurent Kabila will remain there until
security along their western borders is assured.
	   They also dismissed as fabrication newspaper reports of growing
tensions between Uganda and Rwandan troops.
	   President Yoweri Museveni and his Rwandan counterpart Pasteur
Bizimungu discussed regional security matters, particularly the war
in neighboring Congo, during four hours of talks, Museveni's
spokeswoman Hope Kivengere said in a statement.
	   Meanwhile, the government-owned New Vision newspaper said
Tuesday Museveni had ordered the arrest of several Ugandan army
officers suspected of dealing illegally in gold, timber and other
resources in Congo.
	   Museveni and Bizimungu, joined by senior defense and political
officials from their countries, met in the southwestern town of
Kabale on the Rwandan border.
	   The meeting was held against a backdrop of conflicting and
unconfirmed newspaper reports of tensions between the Ugandan and
Rwandan troops backing Congolese rebels in their five-month war to
oust Kabila.
	   The leaders dismissed reports Sunday and Monday in the
independent Monitor newspaper that clashes between Ugandan and
Rwandan troops in mid-December week had left 30 Rwandans and eight
Ugandans dead, Kivengere said.
	   The reports said the fighting erupted over disagreements about
strategy and alleged brutality against civilians by Rwandan forces.
	   ``The two presidents also took the opportunity to discuss some
media rumors that have alleged that there were conflicts or
problems between the UPDF (Uganda People's Democratic Forces) and
the RPA (Rwandan Patriotic Army) and dismissed these as baseless
fabrications,'' the statement said.
	   Both Rwanda and Uganda have acknowledged sending men and
military equipment to the region in support of the rebellion that
broke out Aug. 2 to oust Congolese President Laurent Kabila.
	   Both countries maintain their forces are in eastern Congo to
clear the area of Ugandan and Rwandan rebels operating from bases
there.
	   The statement said the two leaders ``reaffirmed that their armed
forces will remain'' in Congo until better security measures are
put in place, but said they also remained committed to efforts at
finding a peaceful solution.
	   However, common interests appeared to diverge last month when
Congolese businessman Jean-Pierre Bemba declared himself,
apparently with Ugandan support, to be leader of a new rebel
faction that was an alternative to the Rwandan-backed Congolese
Democratic Coalition led by Ernest Wamba dia Wamba.
	   Adding to the confusion Tuesday, New Vision, citing an anonymous
army officer, said Museveni ordered the arrest of the officers
following newspaper reports that some of his soldiers posted in
eastern Congo were spending most of their time trying to make
money.
	   Defense spokesman Steven Kavuma was not available for comment.
	   A senior military officer and four other people were killed in
September when a twin-engine Islander plane going from Kampala to
northeastern Congo, reportedly on a gold-buying mission, crashed
under mysterious circumstances in the foothills of the Rwenzori
Mountains that straddle the border between Uganda and Congo.
	   Contradictory government statements and reports further clouded
the actual events.
	   Citing other unnamed sources, New Vision said since the start of
the rebellion, there has been an influx of Ugandans, most of them
relatives of army officers, on trading missions in eastern Congo.

Mogadishu greets its first police force in eight years

	   MOGADISHU, Somalia (AP) _ Somalis weary of eight years of
anarchy in their capital city on Tuesday cheered the first public
appearance of 2,100 policemen, outfitted and paid for by Libya.
	   The new cops marched in their crisp khaki uniforms across the
October 21 parade grounds that had been decorated with flowers,
ribbons and a banner declaring ``we finally have law and security''
as warlords and Egyptian and Libyan diplomats looked on.
	   The Somali flag _ a single white star on a skyblue background _
flapped in the breeze, the symbol of the state that collapsed nine
years ago.
	   Police commander Col. Abdi Hassan Awaleh Qeybdid said the force
would soon patrol Mogadishu's streets to enforce a return to
stability in the capital and to permit the reopening of the city's
airport and seaport. Both have been closed because of factional
fighting over access and tax revenue since the ill-fated U.N.
peacekeeping mission to Somalia withdrew in March 1995.
	   The police parade included 63 ``technicals'' _ pick-up trucks
mounted with machine guns _ transformed into police vehicles by
coats of dark blue paint.
	   In October, north Mogadishu faction leader Ali Mahdi Mohamed and
south Mogadishu leader Hussein Mohamed Aidid agreed, with Libyan
help, to set up a joint administration in the capital.
	   On Tuesday, Ali Mahdi called on capital residents to cooperate
with the new police force in identifying bandits and looters, often
rogue militiamen and minor warlords who, fearful of losing out on
the benefits of the joint administration, have taken to extortion
and kidnapping to obtain funds.
	   Several faction leaders opposed to the Ali Mahdi-Aidid alliance
have assembled hundreds of armed militiamen and gun-mounted trucks
known as ``battle wagons'' in areas of the capital under their
control.
	   In south Mogadishu, four Islamic courts have set up a common
leadership and established their own fighting force to combat
banditry in the capital.
	   ``Now is the time to forgive each other and forget about the
past,'' Ali Mahdi said at the graduation ceremony.
	   He added, however, that those ``opposing the common good of the
people,'' would be apprehended.
	   Somalia has been without a central government since 1991, when
rival warlords Ali Mahdi and Aidid's late father, Gen. Mohammed
Farah Aidid, joined forces to oust dictator Mohamed Siad Barre and
then turned on each other for control.

	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraq is challenging ``no-fly'' zones over
its northern and southern territory by flying its warplanes through
skies patrolled by the United States and Britain, Iraq's vice
president said Tuesday.
	   During an interview with Associated Press Television News, Taha
Yassin Ramadan was asked if Iraq was flying its own aircraft in the
no-fly zones. He replied: ``We are doing it right now.''
	   ``Iraqi planes, in effect, are flying in a normal manner in
Iraqi airspace,'' Ramadan said.
	   The move came a day after U.S. aircraft fired on an Iraqi
anti-aircraft battery in the northern ``no-fly'' zone. Iraq says
the U.S. attack killed four soldiers and wounded seven others.
	   Ramadan also said Iraq will continue firing at any aircraft that
intrudes on its airspace. ``Our resistance will continue against
any penetration,'' he said. ``The war is still on.''
	   He did not specify whether the Iraqi aircraft flying in the
zones were military or civilian, but almost all of Iraq's passenger
aircraft are either out of the country or unusable.
	   Ramadan's statements came on a day when U.S. and British jets
were not in the air in the north.
	   Lt. Col. Jane Rinell, spokeswoman for the Northern Watch
operation at Incirlik airbase in Turkey, said allied planes ``did
not fly today strictly due to the weather and nothing else.''
	   In Washington and London, defense spokesmen said U.S. and
British warplanes won't be intimidated by the latest threats.
	   ``We will continue to enforce the 'no-fly' zones,'' Lt. Col.
Stephen Campbell said at the Pentagon. ``Nothing has changed.''
	   The United States says its planes fired Monday in self-defense
after coming under Iraqi missile attack, while Iraq claims it fired
in self-defense after Western warplanes intruded on Iraqi skies.
	   The United States and Gulf War allies set up the ``no-fly''
zones in northern and southern Iraq in 1991 and 1992 to protect
Kurdish rebels and Shiite Muslims from President Saddam Hussein's
forces.
	   But Ramadan said Tuesday that ``the so-called air exclusion
zones exist only in the sick imagination of the British and
American administrations.''
	   The Iraqi defiance is likely to escalate its confrontation with
the United States and Britain, which bombed Iraq for four nights
from Dec. 16 and Dec. 19.
	   The state aim of the airstrikes was to diminish Iraq's ability
to build weapons of mass destruction, which U.N. weapons inspectors
were trying to dismantle until they withdrew Dec. 16, complaining
of Iraqi obstruction.
	   Iraq says 62 soldiers and more than 40 civilians were killed in
the strikes. Iraq alleges that many civilian targets were hit, and
not just defense sites as the United States maintains.
	   Iraq also claimed Monday that it shot down an ``enemy plane,''
but U.S. officials said all American planes had returned safely.
	   The claim appeared in banner headlines in all Baghdad newspapers
Tuesday. ``An enemy plane is shot down and search is under way for
the wreckage and pilot,'' the Babil newspaper, owned by Saddam's
oldest son, Odai, trumpeted.
	   But commentaries and editorials made no mention of the four
Iraqi soldiers reportedly killed in the U.S. attack.
	   The new challenge over the ``no-fly'' zones comes as Iraq is
trying to boost its support in the Arab world, where there is
widespread sympathy for Iraqi civilians suffering under U.N.
economic sanctions imposed after Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
	   Iraqi newspapers Tuesday hailed widespread public protests in
Arab capitals against the U.S.-British airstrikes and criticized
Arab governments, which have voiced little opposition to the
bombardment.
	   Under U.N. resolutions, the sanctions cannot be lifted until
U.N. weapons inspectors certify that Iraq is free of nuclear,
chemical and biological weapons along with long-range missiles.
	   Arab leaders must either support Iraq or risk the ``wrath'' of
the Arab masses, the newspapers said, noting the Arab League's
failure to convene a proposed meeting to condemn the bombardment.
	   In a front-page editorial, Iraq's al-Qadissiya newspaper warned
Arab leaders that ignoring ``the snowballing Arab wrath ... will
shake the ground from under their feet.''

Swedish carmaker wishes country were adopting the euro on Jan. 1
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ Sweden's decision not to adopt the euro
on Jan. 1, when 11 other European Union countries do, denies
significant cost savings to carmaker AB Volvo, a company official
said Tuesday.
	   ``Our main competitors are in the euro zone, and if Sweden would
have joined the single currency, our costs would have been several
hundred millions of kronor less,'' said Lars Persson, in charge of
Volvo's euro strategy. That's tens of millions of dollars.
	   Volvo plans to adopt the euro as a group currency from Jan. 1,
2001.
	   Projected benefits should start earlier. As currency exchange
operations in the 11 other countries -- including Germany, France
and Italy -- tend to disappear, price comparisons will be more
transparent.
	   ``We expect to save perhaps a couple of hundred of millions of
kronor even though we are not participating, but the serious thing
for us is that the advantage for our competitors is even greater,''
said Persson.
	   Volvo has approximately one-third of its group sales in the euro
zone.
	   Only about 10 percent of sales are in Sweden. However,
production and administrative operations here are far greater than
that, which means Volvo will be a buyer of Swedish kronor even
after it has adopted the euro internally.
	   From Jan. 1, Volvo will require its subcontractors in the euro
zone to submit prices and bills in euros.

Report: Scandal endangers IOC's Swiss tax exemption
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ The IOC is in danger of losing a special tax
concession worth 2 million Swiss francs (dlrs 1.46) a year as a
result of the Olympic corruption scandal, a Swiss newspaper
reported Tuesday.
	   The exemption from value-added tax (VAT) was granted to the
International Olympic Committee by the Swiss government in
September, nearly four years after the Lausanne-based IOC requested
it.
	   Switzerland has exempted the IOC from direct federal tax since
1981 due to its public service aims. Value-added tax came into
force at the beginning of 1995.
	   But the VAT exemption, approved by the upper house of
parliament, could run into difficulties when the tax is reviewed by
a commission of the lower house Jan. 25, the Geneva daily Le Temps
reported.
	   The IOC has come under intense scrutiny in the light of the
bribery allegations surrounding Salt Lake City's successful bid for
the 2002 Winter Olympics.
	   Salt Lake officials have admitted that six relatives of IOC
members were among those who benefited from nearly dlrs 400,000 in
scholarship aid from the bid committee.
	   There is growing evidence of other favors for IOC members,
including free medical care and gifts in excess of the dlrs 150
limit.
	   IOC executive board member Marc Hodler has alleged that other
Olympic votes were tainted by corruption and claimed that 5 to 7
percent of IOC members are open to bribes.
	   Some Swiss lawmakers are undecided on the VAT exemption,
according to Le Temps.
	   ``(IOC president Juan Antonio) Samaranch and his colleagues must
put things in order to stop the fiddling,'' commission member
Jean-Pierre Bonny was quoted as saying.
	   Another lawmaker, Jean-Michel Gros, said he ``expects
explanations.''
	   IOC director general Francois Carrard said he is confident the
IOC's efforts ``will convince all those who see us objectively.''
	   The Swiss government said in September the IOC's presence in the
country is worth some 100 million francs (dlrs 73 million) per year
to the economy.

Greenland parliament elections set for Feb. 16
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) _ Elections to Greenland's local
parliament will be held Feb. 16, Premier Jonathan Motzfeldt said
Tuesday.
	   Motzfeldt, of the social democratic Siumut party, has led the
Danish territory's home-rule government since last year. He
replaced Lars-Emil Johansen, who resigned.
	   The Cabinet coalition, which also includes the liberal Atassut
party, holds 24 of the 31 seats in parliament. The last parliament
vote was held on March 4, 1995. Elections are held every fourth
year.
	   Greenland, the world's largest island, won substantial home-rule
from Denmark in 1956 and has had its own parliament since 1979.
	   Denmark continues to be in charge of foreign and defense policy,
as well as matters related to law and the currency of the arctic
island's 56,000 people.

The battles around Podujevo: preparations for the spring

<TEXT>
	   PODUJEVO, Yugoslavia (AP) _ The snowy hills of northern Kosovo,
where village kids used to engage in marathon snowball fights, have
turned into a much crueler battlefield at the end of the bloodiest
year in recent Kosovo's history.
	   Now it's the parents, not the kids, in the hills, some in the
uniform of the ethnic Albanian guerrillas fighting for Kosovo's
independence from Serbia.
	   Clashes that erupted Christmas Eve around the town of Podujevo
added at least another 15 people to the more than 1,000 dead in
Kosovo since February, and observers fear an avalanche of violence
may come next spring.
	   ``Winter is the time when snowballs start rolling and growing so
big that they get out of control,'' says William Walker, the
American head of the international observer team hoping to cap the
violence. ``I hope that's not the case.''
	   Walker says the unarmed verification force _ now 700-strong and
set to be increased to 2,000 in the coming weeks _ will not be
pulled out despite the increased danger posed by the recent upward
spiral of bloodshed.
	   ``We have to do whatever we can to stop violence, that's what
we're here for,'' Walker told The Associated Press.
	   Still, the fierce battles around Podujevo, about 30 kilometers
(20 miles) north of the provincial capital Pristina, show that
unarmed observers may not be enough to end the fighting between
government forces and the Kosovo Liberation Army, which is battling
for independence from Serbia, the main Yugoslav republic.
	   After a string of major defeats elsewhere, the guerrillas appear
to have reorganized and increased their presence in the Podujevo
area in the wake of an Oct. 12 truce negotiated by Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic and U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke,
which was supposed to end seven months of fighting.
	   According to Fehim Rexhepi, an ethnic Albanian journalist who
reports on the rebels, there are between 2,000 and 3,000 KLA
soldiers and their armed supporters in the Podujevo region, home to
about 20,000 ethnic Albanian villagers spread across 15 scattered
settlements.
	   ``They are more disciplined, better equipped and prepared for
any battle than several months ago,'' Rexhepi says.
	   And he said total KLA strength has grown to about 6,000
province-wide since the Oct. 12 agreement.
	   Many of the snowed-in villages in the Podujevo area are deserted
in the wake of the latest fighting, except for KLA men in uniform,
who hide behind trees or in wrecked houses, fingering triggers of
their sniper or semiautomatic rifles. They are particularly strong
in Lapastica, now sheltering hundreds of refugees of nearby
burned-out villages.
	   In Podujevo, 2 kilometers (little more than a mile) northeast of
Lapastica, Serbs are anxious, whether they are among the refugees
who fled homes now in rebel-held territory to the west of the town
or the few permanent residents still holding out despite the
closeness of the rebels.
	   If the KLA takes Podujevo, near the northern border of Kosovo,
it can control traffic between Pristina and central Serbia. KLA
trenches already are only a few hundred meters (yards) away from
the 30-kilometer (20-mile) road linking Pristina with Podujevo.
	   ``The KLA will do everything to keep these positions,'' Rexhepi
forecasts.
	   In Podujevo, Srboslav Bisercic, a local official, says that
fellow Serbs now account for less than 3 percent of the 20,000
people remaining here. Another 10,000, mostly Serbs, have left for
safer regions. ``Soon there will be no Serbs here unless the state
... finishes off these bandits and savages,'' he tells a visitor
angrily.
	   A group of grim-looking men nearby smoke nervously as they wait
to hear news of how a Serb police evacuation effort in rebel-held
territory is going.
	   ``My mother and father are there,'' says one of the Serbs,
refusing to give his name . ``They wouldn't listen to me when I
told them to evacuate in time.''
	   Another man curses the West for what he perceived as the latest
manifestation of an anti-Serb conspiracy _ the NATO threat to
attack that forced authorities to call off the crackdown on the
rebels in October and allowed the rebels to regroup.
	   ``Our hands are tied, the world is against us,'' he says.

Tudjman: Army must be ready to solve potential border problems
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By SNJEZANA VUKIC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ZAGREB, Croatia (AP) _ Following new tensions with NATO along
the Bosnian border, President Franjo Tudjman told military
officials Tuesday that the army must be ready for potential
incidents on Croatia's frontiers.
	   ``We came out of the war, but the borders with most of our
neighboring countries are not established yet,'' Tudjman said,
according to the state-run news agency HINA.
	   ``Border cases and incidents could lead to all kinds of
situations and you should have that in mind,'' he said, adding that
Croatia would do all to solve the border disputes by negotiations,
but the border police and the army should be ready to ``secure the
state's policy'' if needed.
	   In 1991, when Croatia, Bosnia and Slovenia seceeded from the old
Yugoslav federation, the former republic borders became the
boundaries of the new independent states. Since the republics'
borders were not always precisely drawn, a number of border
disputes surfaced that the countries are trying to solve by
negotiations.
	   Croatia still is discussing several border points with Slovenia,
Bosnia-Herzegovina and today's Yugoslavia.
	   Last week, Croatia was reportedly contemplating of sending its
troops to Martin Brod, a Bosnian city on the border with Croatia,
after the NATO-led peace troops deployed in Bosnia removed Croatian
border police from the half of the city they controlled since 1995.
	   Martin Brod, situated in southwestern Bosnia, was considered a
Bosnian city before the war. But during the 1995 offensive in which
Croatian army joined Bosnian Muslim troops in routing the Serbs
from that region, Croatia established its police on the river Una
that runs through the city. Croatia said some maps show that part
of the city should be Croatian.
	   But Bosnia insists the city must stay within its borders,
providing maps and other papers that support its claim.
	   The Canadian troops sent armored cars to Martin Brod and briefly
detained four Croatian policemen, as they acted on the instructions
from the top Bosnian international official, Carlos Westendorp.
	   Westendorp decided to restore Bosnian control of the whole city
until the two countries reach an agreement.
	   Besides Martin Brod, Croatia and Bosnia have yet to agree on
about four other border disputes.

	   KATMANDU, Nepal (AP) _ A three-hour gunbattle between police and
Maoist rebels left nine guerrillas dead in western Nepal, police
said Tuesday.
	   Police shot and killed seven rebels Monday in the village of
Kerabari, 75 miles (120 kilometers) west of Katmandu, the Nepalese
capital. Two others who escaped into nearby jungle also were
killed.
	   No further details of the clash were available.
	   Since the insurgency began three years ago, nearly 400 people
have been killed. The guerrillas oppose Nepal's constitutional
monarchy and demand that Nepal be turned into a republic.

	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ A 49-year-old monk on Tuesday was
consecrated bishop by the Roman Catholic Church. He's the first
Swede to hold the post in about 400 years.
	   Anders Arborelius was appointed last month by the Vatican. He
speaks seven languages and spent the past three decades in a
Carmelite monastery in southern Sweden.
	   He was born in Switzerland of Swedish parents, and grew up in
the Swedish city of Lund.
	   The 16th century Reformation religious movement changed Sweden
from an almost entirely Catholic country into a Protestant one
where Catholics were banned. Native Swedes were not allowed to be
Catholic until 1860.
	   The Catholic church claims about 165,000 members in Sweden --
about two percent of the population. Most of its priests are
foreign-born, according to the Stockholm diocese, which includes
the whole country.
	   Arborelius replaced Hubertus Brandenburg, a German, who retired
six weeks ago when he turned 75, the usual retirement age for
bishops.

 &UR; UPDATES with ETA-linked party saying it will vote in favor of
Ibarretxe &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   VITORIA, Spain (AP) _ A moderate pro-Basque independence
candidate was Tuesday expected to be elected premier of the new
regional government with the help of deputies linked to the armed
separatist group ETA.
	   Two months after the Basque elections, the 71-seat regional
parliament convened in this northern city to elect its new
lehendakari _ a Basque word for president.
	   The victory of Juan Jose Ibarretxe from the Basque Nationalist
Party, the largest single party with 21 seats, was being treated by
Spanish media as a foregone conclusion, although the electoral
debate was scheduled into the night.
	   Ibarretxe's election would follow a pact signed Saturday between
his party and the minority Euskal Alkartasuna aimed at establishing
the first entirely pro-independence coalition government since the
region gained autonomous status in 1979, following the death of
dictator Gen. Francisco Franco.
	   But Ibarretxe's election, and the pact's survival, also requires
the support of the radical pro-independence grouping Euskal
Herritarrok that is dominated by Herri Batasuna _ long recognized
as ETA's political wing.
	   Hours before the final vote, Arnaldo Otegi, spokesman and one of
the 14 deputies of Euskal Herritarrok said the coalition will give
its support to Ibarretxe.
	   Ibarretxe centered his address on the fledgling Basque peace
process founded in ETA's observance of an unlimited cease-fire
since September, and the conservative government of Prime Minister
Jose Maria Aznar's gradual softening of its anti-negotiation
stance.
	   ``We are all Basques, we all have responsibility and we must
also all participate in the construction of peace,'' Ibarretxe told
the Basque parliament.
	   ``Dialogue without exclusion and without conditions and with
respect for the decisions taken by Basques is the key, and nothing
else,'' Ibarretxe said referring to a peace plan signed by Basque
nationalists just before ETA called its truce.
	   Known as the Estella Pact, the plan foresees cross-party
negotiations on the status of the Basque region running parallel
with disarmament talks between the government and ETA.
	   But the Estella Pact was slammed by Carlos Iturgaiz, the only
other candidate for lehendakari, as an ``imposition'' of
pro-independence parties. Iturgaiz heads the Basque branch of
Aznar's Popular Party that rejects any change in the status of the
Basque region.
	   The candidate also said that the treat of violence remained and
needed to be ``combated'', despite ETA's truce.
	   Popular Party politicians were ETA's favored targets in the
months prior to the cease-fire, and Iturgaiz has been consistently
suspicious of the slow move towards possible peace negotiations
since the group's cease-fire.
	   ETA has killed nearly 800 people since beginning its violent
campaign for an independent Basque homeland straddling parts of
northern Spain and southern France in 1968.

Arc de Triomphe hit by strike, but end could be near

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ The Arc de Triomphe, one of the world's most famous
monuments to military glory, has become a battlefield in its own
right, with striking workers pitted against management and
frustrated tourists.
	   Workers voted Tuesday to continue their strike for a fourth day
to demand more staff. About 60 people work atop the monumental
stone arch at the head of the Champs-Elysees.
	   Some 50 meters (about 150 feet) high and 45 meters (about 135
feet) wide, the Arc at the head of the Avenue des Champs-Elysees
attracts about 1.4 million visitors a year.
	   Workers complain they can't handle the increasingly large crowds
drawn to the Arc's splendid rooftop view: a panorama of the Right
Bank's skyline and the 12 tree-lined avenues stretching out like
spokes of a wheel.
	   The Arc _ where an eternal flame has flickered above France's
Tomb of the Unknown Soldier since 1920 _ was commissioned by
Napoleon Bonaparte to commemorate his many victories.
	   Construction began in 1806 when the Champs-Elysees, or Elysian
Fields, was still just that. Besides the names of Napoleon's
generals and victories are oversized, neo-classical sculptures
depicting bare-breasted women waving the French colors.
	   Since its completion in 1836, the Arc was the backdrop for
displays of national pomp and military might, not always in
victory.
	   In 1885, millions flocked to the Arc for Victor Hugo's funeral
procession down the Champs-Elysees.
	   In 1940, Nazi troops victoriously goose-stepped from the Arc
down the Champs, the city's most prestigious street. Four years
later, it was Gen. Charles de Gaulle, the leader of the
London-based Free French Forces, who rallied Allied troops to the
Arc for a victory parade applauded by millions of Parisians.
	   After suffering from pollution and vibration from underground
subway lines, the Arc underwent renovations a decade ago that may
be partially responsible for its growing popularity.
	   Though some hearty souls still climb the Arc's winding
staircase, most opt for the high-speed elevator that gets them to
the top in less than a minute.
	   Besides the rooftop view, a spacious indoor hall houses
user-friendly exhibits on French military history.
	   But like other French attractions plagued by recent strikes, the
Arc may be a victim of its own success, with growing crowds
stretching existing staff.
	   Union officials said they hoped the dispute would not drag on.
	   ``We hope to solve this tonight,'' said Francoise Pinson,
spokeswoman for the Union of Cultural Affairs Personnel, whose
members met Tuesday with Culture Ministry officials.
	   Strikes also have hit the Orsay, Louvre and Grand Palais
museums, with employees making similar demands for more staff.
Workers also recently went on strike at the Eiffel Tower.

Ukraine's parliament debates 1999 budget
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By VIKTOR LUHOVYK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Ukraine's parliament on Tuesday approved
projected budget revenues and the deficit for 1999, spending hours
in heated debate between government supporters and the leftist
opposition.
	   The 450-seat Verkhovna Rada voted 272-114 to approve the
government-proposed deficit of 1 percent of gross domestic product
and gross revenues of 34 billion hryvna (dlrs 9.9 billion).
	   The budget debate is to continue Wednesday, with deputies
scheduled to decide how the projected revenues should be divided
between the central and local governments, and also discuss
individual spending and revenue targets.
	   Tuesday's debate followed several budget clashes between the
government and leftist lawmakers in previous weeks, with the two
sides insisting on sharply different targets and failing to reach a
compromise each time.
	   Communists and their supporters continued arguing Tuesday for a
higher deficit to provide for more social subsidies and demanded
higher revenues, which they said government officials were
intentionally lowering to use the remainder for personal gain.
	   ``Never before did we have such a disgraceful budget debate (as
this year), effectively instituting a policy of genocide,'' said
Natalia Vitrenko of the leftist Progressive Socialist Party.
	   ``For the first time ever we touched at the money that has gone
past the budget in previous years, but the government does not want
to part with its shadow resources,'' said parliament's budget
committee chief, Julia Tymoshenko.
	   However, Cabinet officials pleaded with lawmakers to approve the
document they proposed, arguing that with Ukraine's economy
expected to further decline by 1 percent in 1999 and with mounting
debt obligations, the former Soviet republic cannot count on
revenues as high as parliament wanted.
	   ``I'm very concerned about what would await us next year if we
don't approve the budget on time,'' Prime Minister Valery
Pustovoitenko told parliament.
	   Ukraine's government has consistently failed to implement
reforms since gaining independence in 1991. The country has been
plagued by economic decline, mounting wage arrears and a huge
foreign debt.
	   The government wants a well-balanced low-deficit budget to
present to the International Monetary Fund so that it can resume
the suspended dlrs 2.2 billion loan.
	   Many analysts have said that without foreign aid Ukraine would
hardly be able to repay its 1999 debt obligations since the
government cannot raise the required money from internal sources.
	   The government raised only 63 percent of planned annual revenues
in the first 11 months of 1998, while its debt in unpaid wages and
pensions has steadily grown to more than 3 billion hryvna (dlrs 875
million), according to official statistics.

Vatican: Fighting in Republic of Congo kills dozens, sends

<TEXT>
	   VATICAN CITY (AP) _ Government-allied forces in the Republic of
Congo attacked a city in that country's southwest, killing dozens
and sending thousands fleeing, the Vatican's missionary news
service said Tuesday.
	   Fides news service cited missionaries in the targeted city,
Nkayi, in its account of the fighting.
	   It blamed the attack on Angolan soldiers allied to Republic of
Congo President Denis Sassou-Nguesso. The forces bombarded the
35,000-resident city overnight from Saturday and Sunday, Fides
said.
	   On Monday, Republic of Congo authorities decided to evacuate
remaining residents of the city, sending them on a forced march
toward Dolisie, 90 kilometers (55 miles) away, the news service
said.
	   Missionaries expressed particular fears for the safety for the
young men among the residents of the city, in a region known for
its opposition to Sassou-Nguesso.
	   There was no immediate confirmation of the attack from the
Republic of Congo.
	   Sassou-Nguesso seized power in the central African nation last
year. Angola and Chad have soldiers in Republic of Congo supporting
Sassou-Nguesso's government against continued fighting by
opponents.

	   FREETOWN, Sierra Leone (AP) _ Rebel forces battling to oust
President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah have taken control of the central town
of Makeni, defense force officers said Tuesday.
	   Makeni, a strategic town about 120 kilometers (75 miles)
northeast of the capital, Freetown, was the scene of recent heavy
fighting.
	   Rebel fighters battling a West African coalition army known as
ECOMOG succeeded in pushing the defense force into a ``tactical
retreat,'' according to an ECOMOG statement.
	   Sierra Leone's Foreign Minister Sam Banya on Monday said
virtually the entire population of several thousand people fled
Makeni.
	   The United Nations World Food Program on Tuesday warned the
escalating hostilities could jeopardize relief programs in the
country's interior.
	   Food aid shipments to Makeni and other areas have been halted,
affected feeding and distribution programs for close to 24,000
people, WFP said in a statement.
	   ``Those most likely to be affected by the lack of food are
displaced persons who were living in camps and urban areas in the
north and the east,'' said Sierra Leone's WFP representative
Patrick Buckley.
	   Fighting in the eastern Kono region may have forced as many as
40,000 to flee their homes, Buckley said.

Afghan opposition leader urges Bin Laden to leave Afghanistan
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ Afghanistan's opposition alliance on
Tuesday held Muslim militant Osama Bin Laden responsible for the
U.S. missile attacks on Afghanistan in August and urged him to
leave Afghanistan.
	   The United States, which accuses Bin Laden of being behind
bombings of its embassies in Kenya and Tanzania in early August,
rained missiles on Afghanistan on Aug. 21 to destroy what it says
were training camps for Muslim militants run by Bin Laden.
	   ``Because of (Bin Laden's) presence, the country had to face a
missile attack from the United States,'' said opposition commander
Ahmed Shah Massood, who is fighting the Taliban militia, which
controls 90 percent of Afghanistan.
	   ``We don't want this man on Afghan soil,'' Massood said in a
telephone interview from opposition-controlled territory in
Afghanistan. ``Afghanistan is earning a bad name in the world
because of Bin Laden's activities and his training camps,''
	   Bin Laden denies he played a role in the bombings, but has said
that he welcomed the attacks. Earlier this month, Bin Laden urged
Muslims to kill Americans and Britons in retaliation for the
U.S.-British airstrikes on Iraq.
	   The Taliban militia, which his imposed its strict brand of
Muslim rule throughout most of Afghanistan, has refused to expel
Bin Laden from Afghanistan saying he is running religious schools
not military training camps.
	   Massood, a former defense minister, said Bin Laden's forces are
fighting alongside the Taliban against the opposition coalition
based in northern Afghanistan.

On computers, erasing God is OK
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BNEI BRAK, Israel (AP) _ A leading Orthodox rabbi has ruled that
the word ``God'' may be erased from a computer screen or disk,
because the pixels do not constitute real letters.
	   Rabbi Moshe Shaul Klein published his ruling this week in a
computer magazine aimed at Orthodox Jews, ``Mahsheva Tova.''
	   Klein was responding to a question from a reader who was anxious
about whether the ban on erasing the variations on the word ``God''
applied to computers.
	   The rabbi, prominent in ultra-Orthodox circles in the Tel Aviv
suburb of Bnei Brak, ruled that the letters may be erased.
	   ``The letters on a computer screen are an assemblage of pixels,
dots of light, what have you,'' the rabbi's assistant, Yossef Hayad
explained to The Associated Press on Tuesday.
	   ``Even when you save it to disk, it's not like you're throwing
anything more than a sequence of ones and zeroes away,'' Hayad
said.
	   According to Jewish law, printed matter with the word _
``elohim'' in Hebrew, and its manifestations in any other language
_ must be stored, or ritually buried.
	   The existence of the magazine _ a pun that means both ``Good
Computer'' and ``Worthy Thinking'' _ reflects the growing incursion
of modern implements into the world of the ultra-Orthodox.

University removes bust of writer Arthur Koestler
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   EDINBURGH, Scotland (AP) _ A bronze bust of the late writer
Arthur Koestler, alleged in a recent biography to have been a
serial rapist, was removed from a foyer in Edinburgh University
after security fears that it would be defaced, the university said
Tuesday.
	   ``The university decided, as a temporary precaution, to remove
the bust from the Department of Psychology's main entrance hall
into another part of the department, in case anyone decided to take
action against the bust,'' a spokeswoman for the university said.
	   Koestler, who died in 1983 aged 77 in a suicide pact with his
wife, was described this year in David Cesarani's biography, ``The
Homeless Mind,'' as being a heavy drinker who was routinely violent
toward women.
	   British newspapers reported Tuesday that female students
reported feeling uneasy about the statue.
	   ``There was a feeling he should not be there and some female
students reported feeling uneasy under his gaze,'' an unidentified
spokesman for the student's union was quoted as saying in the Daily
Telegraph newspaper.
	   However, the university said that although it was aware of
complaints reported in newspapers, it had received no complaints
directly from students.
	   Koestler was a former Communist whose best-known novel
``Darkness at Noon'' was an indictment of Stalinist terror. He was
held as a prisoner under General Franco during the Spanish Civil
War while working as a journalist, and settled in England in 1940.
	   The writer left money in his will to set up a chair of
parapsychology at a British university to investigate the
paranormal after his death. The 500,000 pounds (dlrs 800,000)
bequest was awarded to Edinburgh University, which erected the bust
in its benefactor's honor.

Rebels push into northwestern Congo, capture town
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GOMA, Congo (AP) _ Rebels advancing into northwestern Congo said
Tuesday they had captured the town of Gemena and approached the
home village of the late dictator Mobutu Sese Seko at Gbadolite
that is also used by the government allies to launch a
counteroffensive.
	   Rebel commander Sylvain Buki said his forces over the weekend
took Gemena, 1,000 kilometers (620 miles) northeast of the capital,
Kinshasa and were poised to overrun Gbadolite near the border with
Central African Republic.
	   Gbadolite is also the base for Chadian troops fighting in
support of President Laurent Kabila.
	   There was no independent confirmation of the rebel claims. But
the rebel forces, supported by Rwanda and Uganda, have been making
steady gains in northern Congo.
	   Kabila accuses Rwanda and Uganda of sponsoring the Aug. 2
rebellion of ethnic Tutsis, disaffected Congolese soldiers and
opposition politicians. Kabila's refusal to negotiate with the
rebels has torpedoed efforts to broker a cease-fire and open
political negotiations.
	   On Tuesday, Rwandan and Ugandan presidents said their forces
will remain in Congo until security along their western borders is
assured.
	   Both countries, which installed Kabila in power after rebels
ostensibly under his command ousted Mobutu in May 1997, accuse the
Congolese president of enlisting thousands of Rwandan and Ugandan
rebels who had operating from bases in eastern Congo to destabilize
their governments.
	   The rebel advance into forested Equateur Province is an attempt
to approach Kinshasa from the northwest, five months after Kabila's
foreign allies, who also include Angola, Zimbabwe and Namibia,
repulsed an assault on the capital.
	   Rebel commanders said their next target is the Congo River port
of Mbandaka, the provincial capital, 600 kilometers (372 miles)
upriving from Kinshasa.

Rabbi rules: On computers, erasing God is OK
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BNEI BRAK, Israel (AP) _ A leading Orthodox rabbi has ruled that
the word ``God'' may be erased from a computer screen or disk,
because the pixels do not constitute real letters.
	   Rabbi Moshe Shaul Klein published his ruling this week in a
computer magazine aimed at Orthodox Jews, ``Mahsheva Tova.''
	   Klein was responding to a question from a reader who was anxious
about whether the ban on erasing the variations on the word ``God''
applied to computers.
	   The rabbi, prominent in ultra-Orthodox circles in the Tel Aviv
suburb of Bnei Brak, ruled that the letters may be erased.
	   ``The letters on a computer screen are an assemblage of pixels,
dots of light, what have you,'' the rabbi's assistant, Yossef Hayad
explained to The Associated Press on Tuesday.
	   ``Even when you save it to disk, it's not like you're throwing
anything more than a sequence of ones and zeroes,'' Hayad said.
	   According to Jewish law, printed matter with the word _
``elohim'' in Hebrew, and its manifestations in any other language
_ must be stored, or ritually buried.
	   The existence of the magazine _ a pun that means both ``Good
Computer'' and ``Worthy Thinking'' _ reflects the growing incursion
of modern implements into the world of the ultra-Orthodox.

France confirms it bowed out of Iraq overflights
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ France confirmed on Tuesday that its planes have
stopped participating in allied overflights over southern Iraq
since Dec. 16, a decision prompted by the U.S.-led bombings against
Iraq.
	   ``The obvious reasons for the French withdrawal were the chain
of events that led to the airstrikes,'' Foreign Ministry
spokeswoman Anne Gazeau-Secret told a daily news briefing.
	   Iraqi Vice President Taha Yassine Ramadan had already said in a
TV interview on Sunday that France had probably stopped its
participation in the U.S.-led air patrols known as ``Southern
Watch,'' but said he was unable to confirm the news.
	   France halted the overflights on the first of a four-day series
of airstrikes by U.S. and British forces aimed at punishing Baghdad
for blocking U.N. weapons inspections.
	   If France withdrew from the Northern Watch mission in 1996, its
warplanes were still patrolling the skies of southern Iraq, where a
no-flight zone had been imposed in August 1992 to protect Shiite
Muslims from Iraqi repression after the 1990-91 Gulf War.
	   However when Americans and British decided to extend the zone to
the 33nd parallel in 1996, Paris decided to keep its forces within
the limits of the 32nd parallel.
	   France has taken a softer line toward Iraq in recent years,
arguing for a lifting of sanctions it says have hurt Iraqi citizens
more than Iraqi President Saddam Hussein and the ruling elite.
France is also eager to renew once-lucrative trade ties with
Baghdad.
	   According to the French Foreign Ministry, French participation
to Southern Watch amounted to 175 people, five 2000C Mirages, two
Mirages F1 CR and one tanker aircraft. French forces are based in
Saudi Arabia.

<TEXT>
	   SAN`A, Yemen (AP) _ The Islamic Jihad _ whose abduction of 16
foreigners ended in tragedy Tuesday with the death of three
hostages _ has a history of political ups and downs in this nation
on the Arabian peninsula.
	   The Yemeni group has loose ties to radical Muslim groups
elsewhere in the Arab world since the Yemeni Jihad's leaders _ like
other Islamic radicals _ fought against the Russian occupation of
Afghanistan in the 1980s.
	   Yemeni fundamentalist groups including Islamic Jihad became
influential after conservative North Yemen united with the
socialist South in 1990 _ following a decades-long war between the
two sides of the split nation.
	   President Ali Abdullah Saleh allied himself with the
fundamentalists to gain leverage over his Socialist rivals. The
Islamic Jihad upped its influence after a 1994 civil war when it
defeated attempts to tear apart the union.
	   After the war, Islamic Jihad imposed strict religious law in
some parts of the country, flogging women for ignoring the Muslim
dress code and men for selling and drinking alcohol, which is
forbidden under Islam.
	   But many ordinary Yemenis resented the interference in daily
life, and Saleh began to fear the group's political ambitions. The
result was Islamic Jihad never got the full influence it sought.
	   The deterioration in relations also had an effect on other Arab
radicals who had taken refuge in Yemen. The government began
expelling Egyptian, Algerian and Pakistani radicals.
	   Government troops also clashed with Yemeni members of Islamic
Jihad to try to weaken the group. The group itself had carried out
several bombings over the years, including one which killed a
Belgian woman tourist.
	   After 1997 parliamentary elections, Saleh tried to get control
of the group by persuading some of its leaders to join his party,
the General People's Congress, and giving them government posts.
	   But those who refused were arrested _ and remain in jail _ and a
new government crackdown began in the past few weeks.
	   Among those rounded up recently was Islamic Jihad's leader,
Saleh Haidara al-Atwi, whose release was demanded by the kidnappers
of the 16 foreign tourists.

	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Former Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell
promised Tuesday a ``thorough and prompt'' investigation into
claims that bribes helped Salt Lake City win the 2002 Winter
Olympic games.
	   Talking with reporters after his initial meeting with members of
a special commission investigating the allegations, Mitchell noted
that the panel has to file its report with the U.S. Olympic
Committee by Feb. 28.
	   ``I entered this process with a completely open mind both as to
the practices and standards which have been utilized in the past
and those which ought to be utilized,'' he said. ``We owe (the
athletes) the obligation to make certain that the Games in which
they participate are in fact and are perceived as totally fair and
above reproach.''
	   Mitchell said that in Tuesday's initial meeting the commission,
which was appointed by the U.S. Olympic Committee, ``established
for ourselves a process which we will use to conduct an
investigation which is at once fair and prompt.''
	   Past and present officials of the Salt Lake City Olympic
Committee have acknowledged they gave members of the international
committee gifts and paid college tuition to some of the committee's
relatives prior to the city being selected for the winter games.

More international verifiers arriving, NATO warns warring sides

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ After the worst outbreak of fighting
in months, more international monitors were sent Tuesday to Kosovo
to shore up the fragile truce between government forces and ethnic
Albanian rebels.
	   Meanwhile, NATO repeated warnings it stands ready to intervene
if the two sides fail to respect the Oct. 12 agreement between
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic and U.S. envoy Richard
Holbrooke, which ended seven months of fighting and averted NATO
airstrikes.
	   That agreement was severely strained by four days of fighting
between government forces and the ethnic Albanian Kosovo Liberation
Army, which erupted Christmas Eve and left at least 15 people dead.
	   Kosovo, a province of Yugoslavia's main republic Serbia, was
generally quiet Tuesday.
	   But the ethnic Albanian-run Kosovo Information Center, reported
some overnight shooting on the outskirts of Kosovska Mitrovica, 30
kilometers (18 miles) northwest of here, which ``made the situation
there very tense and difficult.''
	   In an effort to shore up the October agreement, about 100
international ``verifiers'' were heading Tuesday for Kosovo. The
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which is
running the verification mission, said an undetermined number of
American, Canadian and European observers arrived in Kosovo late
Tuesday and the rest were expected in another day or two.
	   Their arrival will bring to about 700 the number of verifiers
already on the ground in Kosovo. The OSCE expects to have a full
compliment of 2,000 verifiers by mid-January, according to
spokesman Sandy Blyth.
	   The verifiers, however, do not carry weapons, and critics among
ethnic Albanians and Serbs have questioned whether the mission will
be able to prevent a new round of fighting, possibly in the spring.
	   After last week's fighting, the chairman of the OSCE, Polish
Foreign Minister Bronislaw Geremek, warned that continuing violence
could prompt the 54-nation organization to reconsider its
peacekeeping role.
	   But an OSCE spokesman, Jorgen Grunnet, told a radio station in
Saarbruecken, Germany on Tuesday that the Kosovo Verification
Mission had no plans to stop its peacekeeping efforts.
	   As a sign of international resolve, NATO Secretary-General
Javier Solana warned the two sides Tuesday ``not to endanger the
fragile security situation.''
	   ``NATO is ready to intervene if the situation requires,'' Solana
said In Brussels, Belgium.
	   Nevertheless, the rhetoric on both sides underscored the
bitterness between Serbs and the ethnic Albanians, who are
demanding independence for the province.
	   The spokesman for the ethnic Albanian rebels, Adem Demaci, said
the guerrillas will respect the cease-fire ``but we will defend
ourselves with all means if necessary.''
	   Yugoslavia's foreign minister demanded that the KLA be declared
a terrorist organization. In a letter to U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan, Foreign Minister Zivadin Jovanovic accused the rebels
of taking advantage of the Oct. 12 agreement to rearm and regroup.
	   The ultra-nationalist Serbian Radical Party, a close ally of
Milosevic, called Tuesday for ``complete extinction of Albanian
terrorist gangs,'' as the only way to solve the crisis in Kosovo.

Tears of joy for Dean Headley's parents; even Fred Trueman's
</HEADLINE>
smiling &QL; 
 &UR; By ROBERT MILLWARD &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ England's spectacular cricket victory over
Australia was hailed as a ``miracle'' by the media on Tuesday,
while the parents of fast bowler Dean Headley wept tears of joy
after his match-winning performance in Melbourne.
	   In a huge turnaround and a dramatic finish, England beat the
Australians by 12 runs after appearing on course for a third loss
in a row. Needing only 175 to win, Australia collapsed from 130 for
three to 162 all out and Headley, a comparative newcomer in Test
cricket, took six for 60.
	   ``It's a miracle. We win a Test'' the London Evening Standard
said in a front-page headline.
	   Although Australia has already clinched the big prize, the
Ashes, and still leads 2-1 with one Test to go, the euphoria over
such a rare victory over the old enemy was nationwide.
	   At the Stourbridge, central England home of the Headley family,
Dean's father Ron, who played Test cricket for the West Indies,
said he was immensely proud of his son.
	   ``I am one of the luckiest guys in the world really, to have my
son perform like that after what I have done,'' said Ron Headley,
who has lived in England for 30 years. ``Having played the game
myself I know the emotions he will be going through.
	   ``We just hugged each other and there were some tears of joy.''
	   His wife, Gail, was convinced the team was going to lose once
again.
	   ``I went to bed when he got out for a single,'' she said. ``I
thought `That is it, they have not got a chance'. I got up at 6:45
a.m. and Ron, who has had the radio on all night, said `The lad is
doing it but it is very tight'.
	   ``I couldn't stand it. I have been pacing the floor crying and I
had to keep leaving the room. But he did it''.
	   Lord MacLaurin, chairman of the England and Wales Cricket Board,
has flown out to watch the last two Tests.
	   ``They always win for me. I've just turned up for the last two
tests and they have done it for me,'' he said. ``That was really
something. It showed guts and a certain mental toughness. Great
stuff. Now we'll square it at Sydney.''
	   Ian Botham, whose match-turning century against Australia at
Leeds in 1981 was hailed as one of the greatest innings in the
history of the game, said he was surprised that the English players
tried to call the game off as a draw in the late stages.
	   ``England were wrong to try to come off,'' the Sky TV cricket
analyst said. ``I bet England are glad they stayed out there. Their
supporters certainly are. It was one of the great finishes.
	   ``Our supporters have had a hard time and taken a lot of stick.
What a 24 hours it will be for them. Any win against Australia is
beautiful. When you beat them at the MCG it's even more
beautiful.''
	   England's dramatic win sparked celebrations everywhere and even
the team's sternest critics, such as former team selector Ted
Dexter and ex-Yorkshire star Brian Close, were impressed.
	   ``It was thrilling. I got up at 6am to watch it and it was
tremendous entertainment,'' said Dexter, a former England captain
and chairman of selectors.
	   ``Remember that Mark Taylor put us in, which is always a danger
batting last, but they got their comeuppance this time. It's
wonderful when the wheel turns.''
	   Close, also a former England captain famous for his
uncompromising attitude on the field, had watched team fail
miserably, match after match.
	   ``Funnily enough I said after the first innings that this was
the best position we'd been in in a bloody long while. I'm
delighted,'' he said.
	   Sports Minister Tony Banks said the triumph at Melbourne and a
series-tying victory at Sydney would boost the battered image of
English cricket with the World Cup approaching in May.
	   ``It's a tremendous victory and a great boost to cricket, and
the morale that would come from victory in Sydney will do wonders
for cricket in the World Cup year,'' Banks said.
	   ``It's amazing how something like this does wonders for the
well-being even amongst those people who are not interested in the
cricket.''
	   Fred Trueman, probably England's most famous fast bowler who has
spent the last 20 years bemoaning the decline of the English team,
was uncharacteristically euphoric.
	   I'm a very happy man, a very, very happy man,'' the
blunt-speaking former Yorkshire pacemen told reporters. ``Happy New
Year.''

Eiffel Tower announces top record six million visitors
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ A record 6 million people visited the Eiffel Tower
this year, and most were foreigners, tower officials announced
Tuesday.
	   The Eiffel Tower, France's most popular monument, drew twice as
many visitors as the Empire State Building in New York and the
Tower of Tokyo, both of which attracted about three million
visitors.
	   About 80 percent of the tower's visitors were non-French,
including 13 percent from North America, officials said.
	   Last year 5.7 million visited the century-old Eiffel Tower.
Built from 9,700 tons of pig-iron, soaring 1,050 feet above the
City of Light and illuminated by 10,000 light bulbs, it has become
the symbol of a nation and its people.
	   Sixty tons of paint are needed to repaint the tower every seven
years and two tons of paper are required to print yearly admission
tickets.
	   The tower is twice as popular as France's second most visited
monument _ the Louvre museum _ which attracts 3 million visitors
yearly. The Chateau de Versailles comes in third with 2.3 million
visitors.

	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ A 49-year-old monk was consecrated as a
bishop Tuesday by the Roman Catholic Church _ the first Swede to
hold the post in about 400 years.
	   Anders Arborelius was appointed last month by the Vatican. He
speaks seven languages and spent the past three decades in a
Carmelite monastery in southern Sweden.
	   He was born in Switzerland of Swedish parents, and grew up in
the Swedish city of Lund.
	   The 16th century Reformation religious movement changed Sweden
from an almost entirely Catholic country into a Protestant one
where Catholics were banned. Native Swedes were not allowed to be
Catholic until 1860.
	   The Catholic church claims about 165,000 members in Sweden _
about 2 percent of the population. Most of its priests are
foreign-born, according to the Stockholm diocese, which oversees
the whole country.
	   Arborelius replaced Hubertus Brandenburg, a German, who retired
six weeks ago when he turned 75.

Angolan army, rebels continue battles in central highlands
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By CASIMIRO SIONA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LUANDA, Angola (AP) _ The government army said it drove back an
offensive Tuesday by rebel troops encircling the central highland
city of Kuito, killing 30 rebels and capturing two armored vehicles
during a four-hour battle.
	   The UNITA rebels advanced at dawn on Cunhinga, 30 kilometers (18
miles) north of Kuito, Brig. Simione Mucume told state radio RNA.
	   He said that after the attack, the rebels shelled outlying
suburbs of the city with long-range artillery, killing 10
civilians, including a child.
	   There was no independent confirmation of the report.
	   Kuito, which lies 500 kilometers (300 miles) southeast of the
capital Luanda, has been cut off by a rebel siege since the
southwest African country's civil war restarted Dec. 4, ending a
four-year peace process.
	   Huambo, the country's second-largest city which lies 130
kilometers (80 miles) to the west of Kuito, reportedly was quiet,
though the army and rebels were said to be fighting in the
surrounding countryside.
	   The International Red Cross said it could not resume aid flights
to Kuito, where some 30,000 displaced people have joined the local
population of about 100,000, because the rebels were shelling the
airport.
	   However, a flight was scheduled for Huambo early Wednesday, IRC
spokeswoman Francoise Zambelini said.
	   A cargo plane chartered by the United Nations crashed near
Huambo on Saturday. The cause of the crash, as the plane passed
through a war zone, was not known.
	   The army also said the rebels launched an attack on Cubal, 100
kilometers (60 miles) west of Huambo, and that eight local police
officers were missing.
	   Cubal lies on the strategic Benguela railroad, which crosses the
country from the west coast, passing through Huambo and Kuito. The
attack apparently was aimed at preventing the government from
moving reinforcements to the central highlands.
	   The Civil Aviation Authority said Tuesday that an Antonov 12
cargo plane disappeared last weekend en route from the capital
Luanda to Lukapa in the northeast.
	   There was no sign of the aircraft, which belonged to the private
airline Arcar Cargo, officials said.
	   The United Nations observer mission, which is monitoring a 1994
peace accord that halted a two-decade civil war between the rebels
and the government, has been unable to stop the renewed fighting
which so far has focused on the central highlands.
	   The U.N. Security Council has blamed UNITA, a Portuguese acronym
for the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola, for
the return to war.
	   UNITA refused to yield control of areas under its control and
maintained a hidden army, according to the United Nations.
	   The country has been ravaged by conflict since gaining
independence from Portugal in 1975.

	   PARIS (AP) _ A record 6 million people visited the Eiffel Tower
this year, and most were foreigners, tower officials announced
Tuesday.
	   The Eiffel Tower, France's most popular monument, drew twice as
many visitors as the Empire State Building in New York and the
Tower of Tokyo, both of which attracted about three million
visitors.
	   About 70 percent of the tower's visitors were non-French,
including 13 percent from North America, officials said.
	   Last year 5.7 million visited the century-old Eiffel Tower.
Built from 9,700 tons of pig-iron, soaring 1,050 feet above the
City of Light and illuminated by 10,000 light bulbs, it has become
the symbol of a nation and its people.
	   Sixty tons of paint are needed to repaint the tower every seven
years and two tons of paper are required to print yearly admission
tickets.
	   The tower is twice as popular as France's second most visited
monument _ the Louvre museum _ which attracts 3 million visitors
yearly. The Chateau de Versailles comes in third with 2.3 million
visitors.

Three Balkan journalists share The Olof Palme Prize 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ Three journalists working for
independent news organizations in Serbia, Croatia and
Bosnia-Herzegovina, shared the Olof Palme Prize on Tuesday.
	   The three journalists are Veran Matic, chairman of the ANEM, a
network of independent radio stations in Serbia, Senad Pecanin,
chief editor of the independent weekly DANI in Sarajevo,
Bosnia-Herzegovina and Viktor Ivancik, executive editor for the
independent political weekly Feral Tribune in Split in Croatia.
	   The fund cited them for ``continuing the struggle for free
expression despite violations, harassments and abuse.''
	   ``This should be seen as a recognition of all those within
independent media fighting for democracy and peace in the former
Yugoslavia,'' said Pierre Schori, President of the Olof Palme
Memorial Fund.
	   The prize has been awarded annually since 1987 by the Olof Palme
Memorial Fund, established by the family of the assassinated
Swedish prime minister and his Social Democratic Party to foster
international understanding. Recipients of the prize include Cyril
Ramaphosa of South Africa, Czech president Vaclav Havel in 1989
when he still was a dissident in his own country, and Chinese
dissident Wei Jingsheng.
	   The prize this year is worth about $50,000.

Israel threatens to close Palestinian airport over security

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israel has threatened to close down the
Palestinian-run Gaza airport over a security violation, an Israeli
official said Tuesday, a move that could further undermine the
already fragile peace process.
	   Palestinian airport workers refused to allow Israeli security
officials to check the identity of passengers who arrived on an
Egyptian plane Sunday afternoon, most of whom worked for the
Palestinian Authority, Civilian Airport Authority Director Avner
Yarkoni said.
	   Yarkoni conveyed the warning in a letter sent Monday to the
chairman of the Palestinian Civil Aviation Authority Brig. Gen.
Fayez Zeidan. A copy of which was made available to the Associated
Press.
	   ``The Minister of Transport, after consulting the Prime Minister
and the Minister of Defense, instructed us to bring to your
attention his very stern warning that repeated violation of the
(airport) protocol will prevent us from letting you to continue the
operation of the airport,'' Yarkoni said in the letter.
	   Israel retains security control over flights arriving to Gaza
International Airport.
	   Zeidan said that Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and his
entourage were aboard the plane in question _ condition, he said,
that exempted the plane from Israeli security checks under the
protocol.
	   ``The Israeli side has nothing to do with the inspection of Mr.
Arafat's aircraft,'' Zeidan said, adding that Israeli security
officials at the airport complained only that they were not allowed
within the customary 30 meters (yards) of the plane to visually
inspect the disembarking passengers.
	   ``I don't think it's a reason to close the airport,'' Zeidan
said. He said he was investigating the Israeli claims.
	   The airport's opening last month, stipulated by the accords
brokered by U.S. President Bill Clinton at Wye River, Maryland in
October, was hailed by Palestinians as a milestone toward
independence and statehood.
	   Since then, Israel has accused the Palestinians of failing to
contain anti-Israel violence, and has frozen the accords. The
Palestinians, in turn, accuse Israel of reneging on an agreement to
release Palestinians jailed for anti-Israel activities.

Bahrain announces fiscal budget with dlrs 849 million deficit
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANAMA, Bahrain (AP) _ Bahrain's emir, Sheik Isa bin Salman Al
Khalifa, has ratified the island nation's 1999-2000 budget with a
projected deficit of 320 million dinars (dlrs 849 million), the
official Gulf News Agency reported Tuesday.
	   The deficit is considerably higher than the estimated 150
million dinar (dlrs 390 million) shortfalls in the previous two
years.
	   Bahrain, which has much less oil income than its Gulf neighbors,
functions with a two-year budget cycle.
	   The Gulf News Agency said the emir, Sheik Isa bin Salman Al
Khalifa, had ratified the budget.
	   It forecasts revenues at 1.138 billion (about dlrs 3 billion)
and expenditures at 1.458 billion dinars (about dlrs 3.9 billion),
the agency said.
	   Finance Minister Ibrahim Abdul-Karim told the agency that the
budget was constructed amid very ``delicate circumstances'' _ low
world oil prices and difficulty in predicting oil prices in coming
years.
	   Bahrain, like other Gulf states, gets most of its income from
oil. The tiny Gulf island state has an output capacity of just
40,000 barrels a day, compared with 8 million barrels produced
daily by neighboring Saudi Arabia.
	   The Bahrain government's income comes mainly from sales of
products made from imported oil.
	   Earlier this month the finance minister said the government had
decided to tighten its budget for fiscal 1999-2000 by cutting
expenditure on construction and development by dlrs 133 million.
Some 260 million dinars (dlrs 690 million) has been earmarked for
such projects.
	   The minister said the squeeze on capital spending was to provide
``good quality of life'' for Bahrainis in terms of free health,
education and social services.

Yemen's Islamic Jihad has been friend and foe of government

 &UR; With Yemen-Kidnapping &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   SAN`A, Yemen (AP) _ The Islamic Jihad _ whose abduction of 16
foreigners ended in tragedy Tuesday with the death of three
hostages _ has a history of political ups and downs in this nation
on the Arabian peninsula.
	   The Yemeni group has loose ties to radical Muslim groups
elsewhere in the Arab world since the Yemeni Jihad's leaders _ like
other Islamic radicals _ fought against the Russian occupation of
Afghanistan in the 1980s.
	   Yemeni fundamentalist groups including Islamic Jihad became
influential after conservative North Yemen united with the
socialist South in 1990 _ following a decades-long war between the
two sides of the split nation.
	   President Ali Abdullah Saleh allied himself with the
fundamentalists to gain leverage over his Socialist rivals. The
Islamic Jihad upped its influence after a 1994 civil war when it
helped defeat attempts to tear apart the union.
	   After the war, Islamic Jihad imposed strict religious law in
some parts of the country, flogging women for ignoring the Muslim
dress code and men for selling and drinking alcohol, which is
forbidden under Islam.
	   But many ordinary Yemenis resented the interference in daily
life, and Saleh began to fear the group's political ambitions. The
result was Islamic Jihad never got the full influence it sought.
	   The deterioration in relations also had an effect on other Arab
radicals who had taken refuge in Yemen. The government began
expelling Egyptian, Algerian and Pakistani radicals.
	   Government troops also clashed with Yemeni members of Islamic
Jihad to try to weaken the group. The group itself had carried out
several bombings over the years, including one which killed a
vacationing Belgian woman.
	   After 1997 parliamentary elections, Saleh tried to get control
of the group by persuading some of its leaders to join his party,
the General People's Congress, and giving them government posts.
	   But those who refused were arrested _ and remain in jail _ and a
new government crackdown began in the past few weeks.
	   Among those rounded up recently was Islamic Jihad's leader,
Saleh Haidara al-Atwi, whose release was demanded by the kidnappers
of the 16 foreign tourists.

Suspects charged in Dec. 23 slaying of 6 in SAfrica
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DURBAN, South Africa (aP) _ Police on Tuesday charged 20 people
in connection with the slaying of six people last week in the town
of Harding, a police official said.
	   Another ten suspects were released, said police spokesman
Director Bala Naidoo..
	   Police have linked the killings to fighting between two clans in
southern KwaZulu-Natal.
	   More than 20 people died in four different attacks in the
province since Dec. 23, but police have discounted any links among
the killings.
	   In the worst attack on Christmas Eve, eight people died in the
town of Margate.
	   President Nelson Mandela said he backs a special initiative from
the National Director of Public Prosecutions to investigate the
killings.
	   Multiple killings in KwaZulu-Natal receive special attention
after more than 10,000 people died in political clashes in the
years before the first all-race elections in 1994.
	   On Christmas Day in 1995, a political massacre claimed 18 lives
in Shobashobane, when 2,000 armed supporters of the Zulu
nationalist Inkatha Freedom Party attacked rival members of
Mandela's African National Congress.

On computers, erasing God is OK
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: CLARIFIES in last graf that magazine name suggests, rather
than means ``Good Computing''

<TEXT>
	   BNEI BRAK, Israel (AP) _ A leading Orthodox rabbi has ruled that
the word ``God'' may be erased from a computer screen or disk,
because the pixels do not constitute real letters.
	   Rabbi Moshe Shaul Klein published his ruling this week in a
computer magazine aimed at Orthodox Jews, ``Mahsheva Tova.''
	   Klein was responding to a question from a reader who was anxious
about whether the ban on erasing the variations on the word ``God''
applied to computers.
	   The rabbi, prominent in ultra-Orthodox circles in the Tel Aviv
suburb of Bnei Brak, ruled that the letters may be erased.
	   ``The letters on a computer screen are an assemblage of pixels,
dots of light, what have you,'' the rabbi's assistant, Yossef Hayad
explained to The Associated Press on Tuesday.
	   ``Even when you save it to disk, it's not like you're throwing
anything more than a sequence of ones and zeroes away,'' Hayad
said.
	   According to Jewish law, printed matter with the word _
``elohim'' in Hebrew, and its manifestations in any other language
_ must be stored, or ritually buried.
	   The existence of the magazine _ a pun that suggests both ``Good
Computing'' and ``Worthy Thinking'' _ reflects the growing
incursion of modern implements into the world of the
ultra-Orthodox.

Rabbi rules: On computers, erasing God is OK

<TEXT>
	   BNEI BRAK, Israel (AP) _ A leading Orthodox rabbi has ruled that
the word ``God'' may be erased from a computer screen or disk,
because the pixels do not constitute real letters.
	   Rabbi Moshe Shaul Klein published his ruling this week in a
computer magazine aimed at Orthodox Jews, ``Mahsheva Tova.''
	   Klein was responding to a question from a reader who was anxious
about whether the ban on erasing the variations on the word ``God''
applied to computers.
	   The rabbi, prominent in ultra-Orthodox circles in the Tel Aviv
suburb of Bnei Brak, ruled that the letters may be erased.
	   ``The letters on a computer screen are an assemblage of pixels,
dots of light, what have you,'' the rabbi's assistant, Yossef Hayad
explained to The Associated Press on Tuesday.
	   ``Even when you save it to disk, it's not like you're throwing
anything more than a sequence of ones and zeroes,'' Hayad said.
	   According to Jewish law, printed matter with the word _
``elohim'' in Hebrew, and its manifestations in any other language
_ must be stored, or ritually buried.
	   The existence of the magazine _ its title is a pun that suggest
both ``Good Computing'' and ``Worthy Thinking'' _ reflects the
growing incursion of modern implements into the world of the
ultra-Orthodox.

Neighboring Congo's sign non-aggression pact
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRAZZAVILLE, Republic of Congo (AP) _ Presidents from central
Africa's neighboring and at times rival Congos signed a
non-aggression pact Tuesday and agreed to establish a joint border
security force.
	   Host President Denis Sassou-Nguesso from the Republic of Congo
met with visiting President Laurent Kabila from the Democratic
Republic of Congo, formerly Zaire, prior to signing the pact which
reaffirms the sovereignty of both countries.
	   ``I came to Congo to reassure our two peoples, that apart from
some venomous media reports there is nothing wrong in the relations
between our two countries,'' Kabila told reporters during the
signing ceremony.
	   Although Sassou-Nguesso and Kabila espouse friendly bilateral
ties, both leaders in the past have accused each other of
supporting rebel movements in one another's country.
	   Kabila is battling a insurgent army in the east that is moving
steadily into the north of the country. Sassou-Nguesso has been
facing a small but growing threat from a militia army in the south
linked to the country's former government.
	   The two leaders signed a second agreement to establish a joint
border security force composed of military personnel from both
countries.
	   Brazzaville and the Democratic Republic of Congo's capital,
Kinshasa, are twin cities separated only by the Congo River.
	   The pact signed Tuesday comes despite persisting mistrust and
tension from Kabila, who accused Brazzaville of offering safe haven
to members of the government of the late Zairian dictator Mobutu
Sese Seko.
	   Mobutu fled Kinshasa in May 1997 to escape Kabila's advancing
rebel forces. Several of his senior military officers and cabinet
members escaped to Brazzaville.

Parliament passes amnesty law to pardon jailed Albanian officials

<TEXT>
	   SKOPJE, Macedonia (AP) _ Macedonian parliament passed Tuesday an
amnesty law, pardoning four ethnic Albanian officials whose
sentencing to prison terms last year stirred ethnic tensions in the
former Yugoslav republic.
	   Rufi Osmani and Alydin Demiri, mayors of two predominantly
ethnic Albanian towns in western Macedonia, and two other
officials, were jailed to a total of 13 years in prison for
inciting unrest in Gostivar and Tetovo, in July last year.
	   The four then defied a government ban and put up Albanian flags
in the towns, triggering clashes between Macedonian police and
ethnic Albanians in which three people were killed and some 150
wounded.
	   Macedonia, whose 23 percent of the population are restive ethnic
Albanians, borders neighboring Yugoslavia's Kosovo, whose Albanians
are fighting the government forces for secession.
	   Macedonia is a host for a still-forming NATO extraction mission
for Kosovo.
	   There have been fears that Macedonia could explode in similar
violence as in Kosovo. The amnesty law is widely seen as an attempt
to ease ethnic tensions and as a conciliatory move by the
government toward Macedonia's ethnic Albanian parties.
	   But the law also faced criticism from former ruling party, the
Social Democrats or renamed Communists, who said it would only
radicalize the situation. The Social Democrats lost an election
earlier this year to a central-rightist coalition.
	   The amnesty law was passed with 85 votes for, 18 against, and
one deputy abstaining from the vote. Macedonia's parliament has 120
seats.
	   President Kiro Gligorov, who led Macedonia into independence
from former Yugoslavia without bloodshed in 1991, has refused to
pardon the four ethnic Albanian officials saying the consequences
of their moves were too grave. It was not immediately clear whether
Gligorov needs to sign the amnesty law to make it effective.
	   Ethnic Albanian political parties in Macedonia have declared the
sentencing of their officials as ``draconian punishments,'' and
threatened boycott of the government and the assembly.
	   Macedonia is crucial for stability in the Balkans, especially as
a 1,800-man strong NATO force is forming in the country to provide
protection for international monitors in Kosovo in case they run
into trouble.

Russia unveils new version of MiG fighter
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A new generation of one of the world's most
successful military aircraft, the MiG fighter jet, rolled off the
production line Tuesday, a news agency reported.
	   The new MiG-29SMT is an retrofitted version of the standard
MiG-29 fighter, offering more sophisticated instrumentation, longer
range and greater combat load capacity, ITAR-Tass said, quoting the
plane's chief designer, Valery Novikov.
	   ``The overhauling of the MiG-29, which will raise its combat
efficiency eight times, will help to raise the striking potential
of the Russian air force many times,'' Novikov said.
	   The MiG-29 was first produced for the Soviet air force in 1985.
It was the latest version of MiG fighters that had been the
standard attack jet for the Soviet Union and its allies since their
introduction in 1949.
	   The Russian Defense Ministry _ clearly lacking the resources to
develop a new plane _ decided early this year to overhaul 150 to
180 MiG-29s into the more sophisticated SMT version, ITAR-Tass
said. The planes are expected to be in service until 2020, when a
new plane is expected to be developed.
	   Already, funding shortages have held back the retrofitting
program. The Defense Ministry originally anticipated completing 10
to 15 of the new planes this year, rather than a single prototype.
	   Plans now call for 24 of the modernized planes to be completed
next year.
	   The main changes in the new MiG include additional fuel tanks,
which will extend its cruising range up to 3,500 kilometers (2,175
miles); a mid-air refueling system; new avionics and
instrumentation; and a combat load that has been increased from
three to five tons.

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Former Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell
promised Tuesday a ``thorough and prompt'' investigation into
claims that bribes helped Salt Lake City win the 2002 Winter
Olympic Games.
	   Talking with reporters after his initial meeting with members of
a special commission investigating the allegations, Mitchell noted
that the panel has to file its report with the U.S. Olympic
Committee by Feb. 28.
	   Mitchell said the investigation would focus on the circumstances
surrounding the selection of Salt Lake City by the International
Olympic Committee. But he said ``as important, if not more
important'' will be for the panel to make recommendations on
improvements in the bidding process to ensure ``it is fair and
above reproach.''
	   Past and present officials of the Salt Lake City Olympic
Committee have acknowledged that they gave members of the
international committee gifts and paid college tuition to some of
the committee's relatives prior to the city being selected for the
Winter Games.
	   ``I entered this process with a completely open mind both as to
the practices and standards which have been utilized in the past
and those which ought to be utilized,'' he said. ``We owe to them
(the athletes) the obligation to make certain that the games in
which they participate are in fact and are perceived as totally
fair and above reproach.''
	   The allegations also are being reviewed by the U.S. Justice
Department.
	   Mitchell said that in the initial meeting Tuesdayday, the five
commission members, appointed by the U.S. Olympic Committee,
``established for ourselves a process which we will use to conduct
an investigation that is at once thorough and prompt.''
	   Mitchell said the commission's objective was ``to encourage and
enhance and live up to'' the ideals of the Olympic movement.
	   He described the panel's effort as ``a review of the
circumstances surrounding the Salt Lake City bidding process'' as
well as to ``make recommendations to the U.S. Olympic Committee for
its use in future bidding processes, to try to make as certain as
humanly possibly that those processes are fair and above
reproach.''
	   Accusations of scandal and bribery have rocked the Olympic
movement, prompting the IOC to call for the first inquiry, followed
by Salt Lake organizers early this month asking its independent
ethics panel to investigate.
	   The IOC expects to wrap up its own probe by Jan. 23. Salt Lake
organizers, meanwhile, have said its ethics board would report its
findings no later than Feb. 11.
	   Any delays would likely irritate sponsors who pay an increasing
percentage of the multimillion-dollar sports budget and have told
Olympic officials that they want the controversy handled swiftly.
	   Olympic officials have been contacting sponsors to assure them
that action is being taken to maintain the Olympics image of high
ideals and ethics.

Russia's official for chemical, biological weapons problems
</HEADLINE>
dismissed &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The head of a presidential committee in charge of
issues related to chemical and biological weapons has resigned, a
news report said Tuesday.
	   President Boris Yeltsin signed a decree accepting the
resignation of Pavel Syutkin, the ITAR-Tass news agency reported.
	   No reason for the resignation was given, and no replacement has
been named.
	   Russia insists it has scrapped the Soviet Union's biological
weapons program, and is trying to destroy its huge stockpile of
chemical weapons.
	   But concern has been mounting about the costs of destroying
Russia's 44,000 tons of deteriorating chemical weapons _ the
largest stockpile in the world _ which it promised to get rid of
when it ratified the international Chemical Weapons Convention last
year.
	   A prominent analyst warned recently that Russia's cash-starved
government may resort to burning the chemical weapons if it cannot
come up with the money for more environmentally safe and
internationally condoned methods of dismantling and disposal.
	   Yeltsin ordered his prime minister last month to step up efforts
to to attract private funding to help Russia destroy its chemical
weapons stockpile.
	   In a sign of another problem, Russia's Emergency Situations
Ministry announced last week that chemical weapons dumps in the
Baltic Sea are contaminating the water with heavy metals and
arsenic.
	   Russia says it stopped producing chemical weapons in 1987.
	   Russia also insists it has strictly complied with the 1972
Biological Weapons Convention, which bans the development,
production and stockpiling of biological and toxin weapons.
	   However, some experts have claimed that Russia may be keeping
alive a portion of its Cold War biological weapons program.
	   Both Russia and the United States continue to do research on
programs to defend themselves against biological attacks.

Brazil's Fluminese buys Italian midfielder
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) _ Italy's veteran midfielder Nicolas
Berti is headed for Brazil to join Fluminese, a team official said
Tuesday.
	   The 31-year-old Berti, who played last season with England's
Tottenham Hotspur, will arrive Saturday to sign a two-year contract
with the Rio club, Vice President Francisco Horta said in a radio
interview.
	   Berti reportedly will earn 40,000 reals (dlrs 33,000) a month
during the two-year contract. Financing is expected to come in part
from a deal being finalized with Brazil's FonteCindam investment
bank.
	   Berti, who played for Italy in the World Cups of 1990 and 1994,
is part of a rebuilding campaign by Fluminense, a national champion
in 1984 that fell to the third division last season.
	   The club also is pursuing at least three other foreign players:
Belgian goalie Preud'homme and Portuguese stars Rui Costa and
Peixe.
	   Fluminese players return from vacation next week for pre-season
training. The first official game is against Santos on Jan. 23 for
the Rio-Sao Paulo Tournament.

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ New Year's eve and the weekend
following won't be so-called banker's hours for thousands of bank
employees in Germany, the institutions said Tuesday.
	   The launch of Europe's new currency - the euro - will see
bankers especially busy from Thursday when conversion rates for the
11 currencies joining the venture are set and Jan. 4, the first
trading day of the euro.
	   About 8,000 people at Germany's four largest banks, the stock
exchange, the European Central Bank and the Deutsche Bundesbank
will be involved in the process of redenominating securities,
payment and settlement systems.
	   Deutsche Bank will have 2,000 staff worldwide working over the
conversion weekend, 1,000 alone at the Frankfurt headquarters where
they'll being doing shifts around the clock, a spokesman said.
	   A Dresdner Bank spokeswoman said about 1,700 people would be
working in its Frankfurt headquarters over the conversion weekend,
and another 900 in the rest of Germany.
	   Commerzbank said it will have about 300 people busy with the
conversion, and Munich-based Hypo-Vereinsbank said it will have
about 500 employees adjusting some 300 computer programs.
	   Deutsche Bundesbank said it will have about 1,200 on the job
around the country and a 90-person team will be doing the
conversion for Deutsche Boerse - the stock exchange.
	   At the Frankfurt-based European Central Bank, which takes over
responsibility for the joint monetary policy on Jan. 1, some 150 of
it of 570-strong workforce will be involved in the conversion, with
many others on call, a spokeswoman said.
	   The 11 countries in the monetary merger are Germany, France,
Italy, Ireland, Spain, Portugal, Austria, the Netherlands,
Luxembourg, Belgium and Finland. Many people are expected to be
burning the midnight oil in other countries as well.

Security bars opposition from delivering petition

<TEXT>
	   KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) _ Security guards on Tuesday prevented the
leaders of several banned Sudanese opposition parties from handing
over a protest letter to President Omar el-Bashir.
	   The delegation members later told a news conference they sent
their memorandum by fax and registered mail to the president.
	   A 17-man delegation included former Vice President Abel Alier
and several former generals.
	   The guards at the palace told the group that el-Bashir was not
in his office. And they confiscated the film of photographers who
covered the event.
	   The opposition leaders called on el-Bashir to ``work out a
comprehensive, just and permanent peace agreement that ends the
war'' in the south.
	   They also asked for ``the establishment of a strong, democratic
foundation for the administration of the country.''
	   Southern rebels have been fighting for 15 years for more
autonomy from the Islamic north. Some 1.9 million Sudanese have
died in the fighting and resulting famines.
	   El-Bashir earlier this month signed into law a bill that allows
Sudanese to form ``political associations'' starting Jan. 1.
	   The new constitution adopted in June does not mention the right
to form political parties, which el-Bashir banned after the
military coup that brought him to power in 1989. But it does allow
political associations.
	   Sudanese opposition leaders living in exile have rejected the
constitution, which is based on Islamic law, and vowed to keep up
their struggle for democracy.
	   A senior member of the ruling National Congress rejected the
demands made Tuesday by the opposition leaders in Khartoum.
	   ``We don't want the former (opposition) leaders to think that
the new era means a return of their parties without accepting the
new constitution,'' said Mohammed Hassan el-Amin, head of the
political department of the National Congress.
	   The opposition leaders blamed el-Bashir's government for the
``total collapse of the economy'' and human rights violations.
	   It also accused the government of ``widespread institutionalized
corruption'' and of being isolated from its neighbors and the
international community.
	   The opposition called for a ``free and fair general elections
... under regional and international supervision.''

	   The announcement followed talks in the Greek capital Athens
earlier in the day between Greek and Cypriot officials aimed at
defusing a political crisis over the missiles.
	   There has been speculation that the S-300 anti-aircraft missiles
will be diverted to the southern Greek island of Crete.
	   But both Clerides and Greek Premier Costas Simitis gave nothing
away after their meeting, which also was attended by the Greek
defense and foreign ministers.
	   After the meeting, Clerides returned to Nicosia for the National
Council meeting.
	   Diverting the missiles to Crete could defuse tensions with
Turkey, which has threatened military action to stop the missiles'
deployment in Cyprus.
	   Cyprus has been divided into a Greek Cypriot-controlled south
and a Turkish-occupied north since 1974, when Turkey invaded after
a short-lived coup by supporters of union with Greece.
	   The United States and NATO have criticized Clerides' decision
two years ago to purchase the missiles, fearing conflict between
NATO members Turkey and Greece. Athens has a defense pact with the
Greek Cypriots.
	   The missiles issue has also caused political tensions in Cyprus,
where the outcome of Tuesday's meeting could affect the survival of
Clerides' government.
	   The Socialist EDEK party, which holds the ministries of defense
and education, has warned it will withdraw from the government if
the missiles are not deployed as planned.
	   Other opposition parties maintain Clerides should resign,
following his promise to do so if the missiles are not deployed.
	   The Cypriot president had said previously that he would agree to
cancel the missiles' deployment only if Turkey accepted his
demilitarization proposal or if there was progress in the
U.N.-sponsored talks for the reunification of the island.
	   A U.N. Security Council resolution adopted unanimously last week
called for a reduction of weapons and troops in Cyprus and the
resumption of the talks.

Turkish Cypriot parties reach deal on forming government
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) _ Turkish Cypriot Premier-designate Dervis
Eroglu and the leader of a center-left party on Tuesday agreed to
form a government that would pursue the goal of international
recognition for the breakaway state.
	   President Rauf Denktash was expected to approve of the coalition
on Wednesday by formally accepting the proposed Cabinet list.
	   Eroglu's center-right National Unity Party, which won 24 seats
in the Dec 6. elections, reached the deal with Mustafa Akinci's
Salvation party, which has seven seats in the 50-member Parliament,
the Turkish Cypriot news agency, TAK, reported.
	   Eroglu won 40 percent of the votes in elections earlier this
month what was seen as approval for his hardline stance over the
future of the island. He has headed a coalition in the breakaway
state since 1996.
	   The Salvation Party on Tuesday agreed to closer economic
cooperation with Turkey despite having voted against a series of
economic deals that foresee an economic integration with Turkey in
the past.
	   Cyprus has been divided since 1974, when Turkey sent in troops
after a coup by Greek Cypriots seeking union with Greece.
	   The Turkish Cypriots declared their own state in 1983, which is
only recognized by Turkey.
	   Numerous U.N. efforts to reunify the island have failed.

<TEXT>
	   FORT-DE-FRANCE, Martinique (AP) _ Police on Tuesday cleared
angry banana workers from a back entrance of Martinique's main port
as exporters rushed to move shipments blocked for weeks by
protesters' barricades.
	   The workers continued to block the port's main entrance with a
weighted freight container. Police reported no injuries or arrests.
	   About 200 banana workers struck Nov. 21 to demand raises. They
agreed Dec. 19 to remove the barricades, but raised them again
after labor negotiations fell through on Dec. 22.
	   On Monday, police cleared the back entrance long enough for
freight companies to move about 300 containers of goods ranging
from clothing to groceries. As soon as they left, the protesters
resumed the blockade.
	   About 4,200 containers are stranded on the port, said
Jean-Claude Lubin, manager of the Martinique Chamber of Commerce.
He said the protesters struck as retailers were gearing up for the
lucrative holiday business season.
	   ``Several companies will face financial obstacles and file for
bankruptcy because of the strike,'' Lubin told the newspaper
France-Antilles.
	   Companies have lost about dlrs 200 million (1 billion French
francs) because of the barricades, said Daniel Robin, president of
the Regional Union of Small Companies.
	   Banana shipments, meanwhile, are rotting in warehouses.
	   On Dec. 18, hundreds of company managers gathered in front of
the government's prefecture offices to stage a counter-protest
against the workers.

Israeli general says it's `unnatural' for women to be pilots

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ An Israeli air force general told a
parliamentary committee that it was ``unnatural'' for women to be
pilots, sparking outrage among female legislators.
	   Legislator Marina Solodkin, who chairs the Committee on the
Status of Women, said Tuesday that the comments showed that the air
force has not changed its attitude toward women despite some
reforms.
	   Last year, Israel's Supreme Court ordered the air force to
change its policy of training only men as pilots and to admit women
to the course. One of the new recruits completed a combat
navigation course Tuesday, the first woman to reach such an
advanced stage of training.
	   The latest controversy began Monday when Brig. Gen. Gil Regev
told Solodkin's committee that women don't have the stamina to be
pilots and that the job interferes with child-rearing.
	   ``I'm concerned about the survival rate of the female
soldiers,'' Solodkin quoted Regev as saying. ``I also think it's
not natural for there to be female pilots.''
	   The army spokesman's office wouldn't comment directly on Regev's
alleged statements but said that the air force is implementing the
Supreme Court decision allowing women to train as pilots.
	   ``On Thursday, for the first time, a female candidate will
successfully complete the course,'' the spokesman said.
	   After her graduation on Thursday, Second Lt. Sari _ a native of
the well-appointed Tel Aviv suburb of Raanana _ will fly F-16's,
Israel's Channel Two TV said. It is army policy to only release the
first names of combat pilots.
	   Solodkin said the air force apparently was reluctant to change.
	   ``They show unwillingness to accept the women as equals to
men,'' Solodkin said. ``This is unprofessional because they don't
even see the advances of women in other countries in this field.''
	   In Israel, women are drafted for nearly two years while men do
three years of compulsory service. However, women mostly serve in
clerical jobs and rarely hold command positions.
	   In a landmark ruling in 1995, the Supreme Court overturned an
army policy that barred women in combat. Two years ago, the court
ordered the air force to accept women in its courses and the first
women were accepted last year.
	   Israeli President Ezer Weizman has said he disagreed with the
decision. His comments to Alice Miller, the pilot who pressed the
landmark case, underscored attitudes within the military _ and
created a stir.
	   In a telephone call responding to a letter from Miller, Weizman,
a former air force chief, suggested she seek her future elsewhere,
saying, ``Listen, young lady, have you ever seen a young man darn
socks?''

	   FREETOWN, Sierra Leone (AP) _ A top rebel commander on Tuesday
said his forces would begin attacking Sierra Leone's capital within
two days if the government fails to agree to immediate talks to be
mediated by the Organization or African Unity.
	   ``This is our ultimatum,'' rebel leader Sam Bockarie said in a
telephone interview from his hideout in the countryside. ``If a
dialogue is not started we will have to invade Freetown. They have
48 hours.''
	   The renewed threat comes after Sierra Leone's defense force
retreated from the key central town of Makeni and were redeploying
to defend the capital.
	   The rebel Revolutionary United Front along with allies from
Sierra Leone's disbanded military are demanding President Ahmed
Tejan Kabbah's resignation and rejected an offer of amnesty in
return for their weapons.
	   Bockarie said the rebels would not lay down their arms, calling
instead for mediation by the Organization of African Unity's
chairman, Blaise Compaore, the President of Burkina Faso.
	   A West African intervention force led by Nigerian troops has
been fighting on Kabbah's behalf, but in recent days it has been
caught off guard by rebel advances.
	   Makeni, a strategic town about 120 kilometers (75 miles)
northeast of the capital, Freetown, fell to the insurgents in
recent days after heavy fighting in the area.
	   The coalition defense force, known as ECOMOG, were driven into a
``tactical retreat'' from Makeni, according to an ECOMOG statement.
	   Sierra Leone's Foreign Minister Sam Banya on Monday said
virtually the entire population of several thousand people fled
Makeni.
	   The United Nations World Food Program on Tuesday warned the
escalating hostilities could jeopardize relief programs in the
country's interior.
	   Food aid shipments to Makeni and other areas have been halted,
affected feeding and distribution programs for close to 24,000
people, WFP said in a statement.
	   ``Those most likely to be affected by the lack of food are
displaced persons who were living in camps and urban areas in the
north and the east,'' said Sierra Leone's WFP representative
Patrick Buckley.
	   Fighting in the eastern Kono region may have forced as many as
40,000 to flee their homes, Buckley said.
	   In February, ECOMOG ousted a military junta with ties to the
Revolutionary United Front.
	   But the West African intervention force has failed to disarm the
rebels who are now staging a serious counter-offensive.
	   ECOMOG troops, including fresh reinforcements from Ghana, are
focused on defending the capital, a senior official from Ghana
said.
	   ``We have sent some men and officers to help beef up what is
already on the ground,'' said the senior Ghanaian defense ministry
official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
	   Nigeria, meanwhile, sent an additional 1,000 soldiers to back up
their positions in Freetown.
	   Diplomats from West Africa, the United States and Britain
meeting Monday in the Ivory Coast called for more aid to help
defend Sierra Leone's embattled government.
	   Rebel units, however, claim to have closed to within 20
kilometers (12 miles) of the capital.
	   Banya said mercenaries from Liberia, Burkina Faso and the
Ukraine were fighting alongside the rebels. Bockarie dismissed that
claim as propaganda.

Israel threatens to close Palestinian airport over security

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with comments from Palestinian official and

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israel has threatened to close down the
Palestinian-run Gaza airport over a security violation, an Israeli
official said Tuesday, a move that could further undermine the
already fragile peace process.
	   Palestinian airport workers refused to allow Israeli security
officials to check the identity of passengers who arrived on an
Egyptian plane Sunday afternoon, most of whom worked for the
Palestinian Authority, Civilian Airport Authority Director Avner
Yarkoni said.
	   Israel, which retains security control over flights arriving at
Gaza International Airport, maintains the move violated an
Israeli-Palestinian security protocol.
	   Yarkoni conveyed the warning in a letter sent Monday to the
chairman of the Palestinian Civil Aviation Authority Brig. Gen.
Fayez Zeidan. A copy of the letter was made available to the
Associated Press.
	   Yarkoni said in the letter that the transportation minister,
after consulting with the prime minister and defense minister,
``instructed us to bring to your attention his very stern
warning,'' and that repeated violations will ``prevent'' Israil
from allowing the airport to continue operation.
	   Zeidan said that Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and his
entourage were aboard the plane in question, and he said that
exempted the plane from Israeli security checks under the protocol.
	   ``The Israeli side has nothing to do with the inspection of Mr.
Arafat's aircraft,'' Zeidan said, adding that Israeli security
officials at the airport complained only that they were not allowed
within the customary 30 meters (yards) of the plane to visually
inspect the disembarking passengers.
	   ``I don't think it's a reason to close the airport,'' Zeidan
said. He said he was investigating the Israeli claims.
	   The airport's opening last month, stipulated by the accords
brokered by U.S. President Bill Clinton at Wye River, Maryland in
October, was hailed by Palestinians as a milestone toward
independence and statehood.
	   Since then, Israel has accused the Palestinians of failing to
contain anti-Israel violence, and has frozen the accords. The
Palestinians, in turn, accuse Israel of reneging on an agreement to
release Palestinians jailed for anti-Israel activities.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ After the worst outbreak of fighting
in months, more international monitors were sent Tuesday to Kosovo
to shore up the fragile truce between government forces and ethnic
Albanian rebels.
	   Meanwhile, NATO repeated warnings it stands ready to intervene
if the two sides fail to respect the Oct. 12 agreement between
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic and U.S. envoy Richard
Holbrooke, which ended seven months of fighting and averted NATO
airstrikes.
	   That agreement was severely strained by four days of fighting
between government forces and the ethnic Albanian Kosovo Liberation
Army, which erupted Christmas Eve and left at least 15 people dead.
	   Kosovo, a province of Yugoslavia's main republic Serbia, was
generally quiet Tuesday.
	   But the ethnic Albanian-run Kosovo Information Center, reported
some overnight shooting on the outskirts of Kosovska Mitrovica, 30
kilometers (18 miles) northwest of here, which ``made the situation
there very tense and difficult.''
	   OSCE sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said four
bodies were found Tuesday, two in Kosovska Mitrovica and two others
near the southern town of Prizren. The Serb Media Center reported a
fifth body -- a 55-year-old ethnic Albanian man -- was found near
the southwestern town of Pec.

	   BEIT EL, West Bank (AP) - An Israeli military court on Tuesday
charged a Palestinian American businessman with funneling money to
the Islamic militant group Hamas.
	   The court said the money went to Adel Awadallah, a top Hamas
fugitive and mastermind of suicide bombings in Israel. Awadallah
was killed in an Israeli commando raid in September.
	   The court ordered Jamil Sarsour held until the end of
proceedings. It was not clear when Sarsour was arrested.
	   Sarsour denied any connection to Hamas. ``I only made a small
contribution to the family (of Awadallah), that's all I did,''
Sarsour, a resident of the West Bank town of Ramallah, told Israel
army radio on Tuesday.
	   Sarsour's hometown in the United States was not immediately
available.

Iraq says it is defying allied-patrolled no-fly zones
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: AMs; UPDATES with U.S., British saying no reports of Iraqi
flights over no-fly zones, Iraq Foreign Ministry statement. &QL; 
 &UR; AP Photos BAG 101-103
 &UR; By LOUIS MEIXLER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ A defiant Iraq said Tuesday that its
aircraft are flying in the no-fly zones patrolled by U.S. and
British warplanes and its anti-aircraft batteries remain ready to
fire on allied planes.
	   The statement comes only a day after U.S. warplanes opened fire
on an Iraqi anti-aircraft position in the northern no-fly zone,
killing four Iraqi soldiers. Washington said the planes attacked
after Iraq shot missiles at the aircraft.
	   Iraq's latest move appears to be aimed at building support among
Arabs who angrily protested mid-December's U.S.-British airstrikes
_ but whose governments did little to back Iraq's demands for
lifting eight-year-old U.N. sanctions on the country.
	   Vice President Taha Yassin Ramadan voiced Iraq's latest defiance
when asked in an interview with Associated Press Television News if
Iraq was flying aircraft in the no-fly zones.
	   ``We are doing it right now,'' he replied.
	   ``Iraqi planes in effect are flying in a normal manner in Iraqi
airspace,'' he added.
	   Ramadan did not specify whether the aircraft were military or
civilian, but almost all of Iraq's passenger aircraft are either
out of the country or unusable. All aircraft in Iraq are owned by
the government.
	   U.S. and British military officials expressed skepticism about
Ramadan's assertion that Iraqi planes took to the air.
	   In Washington, Col. Richard Bridges said there were no immediate
reports of Iraqi aircraft in northern and southern no-fly zones.
	   ``We will continue to enforce the no-fly zones,'' said Lt. Col.
Stephen Campbell. ``Nothing has changed.''
	   A spokesman for the British Defense Ministry _ who spoke on
customary condition of anonymity _ also reported no Iraqi air
activity and added Britain was ready to take action ``should the
conditions of the no-fly zones be breached.''
	   The United States and its allies set up no-fly zones in northern
and southern Iraq to protect Kurds and Shiite Muslims from air
attack after forces loyal to President Saddam Hussein put down twin
rebellions in those regions after the 1991 Gulf War.
	   There were no flights over the northern no-fly zone on Tuesday
``strictly due to weather and nothing else,'' said Lt. Col. Jane
Rinell, a U.S. military spokeswoman.
	   A spokesman for the southern zone said flights continued and
``there were no disturbances'' from the Iraqi side.
	   ``Things were normal for the no-fly zone missions and we have
been flying every day,'' Capt. Michael Shavers said from Joint Task
Force South West Asia based in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.
	   Iraq has never recognized the zones, and Ramadan repeated the
government's view Tuesday.
	   ``The so-called air exclusion zones exist only in the sick
imagination of the British and American administrations,'' he said.
	   He also stressed Iraqi anti-aircraft batteries were ready to
fire on allied aircraft inside Iraq.
	   ``Our resistance will continue against any penetration,'' he
said. ``The war is still on.''
	   Iraqi newspapers on Tuesday applauded the public protests in
Arab capitals after the United States and Britain bombed Iraq for
four nights beginning Dec. 16.
	   The airstrikes were ordered after U.N. weapons inspectors
reported Iraq was blocking their work. The U.N. sanctions _ imposed
after Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait _ will not be lifted until the
inspectors declare Iraq is free of weapons of mass destruction.
	   In a front-page editorial, the al-Qadissiya newspaper warned
Arab leaders that ignoring ``the snowballing Arab wrath ... will
shake the ground from under their feet.''
	   Iraqi criticism was especially harsh toward Egyptian President
Hosni Mubarak, who said in an interview published Monday that ``the
ruling regime (in Iraq) is the reason for all the problems ... and
Egypt naturally does not support this regime.''
	   The daily Babil, owned by Saddam's son Odai, compared Mubarak's
comments to ``the panting of a dog.''
	   Iraq's Foreign Ministry also issued a statement criticizing the
Arab League for postponing a meeting that was supposed to be held
Wednesday to discuss Iraq's plight.
	   The statement, carried by the official news agency, suggested
the delay was caused by Saudi Arabia, which it said ``does what
America wants at the expense of its own sovereignty and dignity.''

Israeli general says it's `unnatural' for women to be pilots
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with details of first woman to complete

 &UR; By LAURIE COPANS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ An air force general's comments to a
parliamentary committee that it is ``not natural'' for women to be
pilots has sparked outrage among female lawmakers.
	   Legislator Marina Solodkin, who chairs the Committee on the
Status of Women, said Tuesday that the comments showed that the air
force has not changed its attitude toward women despite some
reforms.
	   Last year, Israel's Supreme Court ordered the air force to
change its policy of training only men as pilots and to admit women
to the course. One of the new recruits completed a combat
navigation course Tuesday, the first woman to reach such an
advanced stage of training.
	   The latest controversy began Monday when Brig. Gen. Gil Regev
told Solodkin's committee that women don't have the stamina to be
pilots and that the job interferes with child-rearing.
	   ``I'm concerned about the survival rate of the female
soldiers,'' Solodkin quoted Regev as saying. ``I also think it's
not natural for there to be female pilots.''
	   Regev was not available for comment Tuesday and the army
spokesman's office said only that the air force is implementing the
Supreme Court decision allowing women to train as pilots.
	   ``On Thursday, for the first time, a female candidate will
successfully complete the course,'' the spokesman said.
	   After her graduation on Thursday, Second Lt. Sari _ a native of
the well-appointed Tel Aviv suburb of Raanana _ will fly F-16's,
Israel's Channel Two TV said. It is army policy to only release the
first names of combat pilots.
	   Solodkin said the air force apparently was reluctant to change.
	   ``They show unwillingness to accept the women as equals to

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ After the worst outbreak of fighting
in months, more international monitors were sent Tuesday to Kosovo
to shore up the fragile truce between government forces and ethnic
Albanian rebels.
	   Meanwhile, NATO repeated warnings it stands ready to intervene
if the two sides fail to respect the Oct. 12 agreement between
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic and U.S. envoy Richard
Holbrooke, which ended seven months of fighting and averted NATO
airstrikes.
	   That agreement was severely strained by four days of fighting
between government forces and the ethnic Albanian Kosovo Liberation
Army, which erupted Christmas Eve and left at least 15 people dead.
	   Kosovo, a province of Yugoslavia's main republic Serbia, was
generally quiet Tuesday.
	   But the ethnic Albanian-run Kosovo Information Center, reported
some overnight shooting on the outskirts of Kosovska Mitrovica, 30
kilometers (18 miles) northwest of here, which ``made the situation
there very tense and difficult.''
	   OSCE sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said four
bodies were found Tuesday, two in Kosovska Mitrovica and two others
near the southern town of Prizren. The Serb Media Center reported a
fifth body _ a 55-year-old ethnic Albanian man _ was found near the
southwestern town of Pec.
	   In an effort to shore up the October agreement, about 100
international ``verifiers'' were heading Tuesday for Kosovo. The
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which is
running the verification mission, said an undetermined number of
American, Canadian and European observers arrived in Kosovo late
Tuesday and the rest were expected in another day or two.
	   Their arrival will bring to about 700 the number of verifiers
already on the ground in Kosovo. The OSCE expects to have a full
compliment of 2,000 verifiers by mid-January, according to
spokesman Sandy Blyth.
	   The verifiers, however, do not carry weapons, and critics among
ethnic Albanians and Serbs have questioned whether the mission will
be able to prevent a new round of fighting, possibly in the spring.
	   After last week's fighting, the chairman of the OSCE, Polish
Foreign Minister Bronislaw Geremek, warned that continuing violence
could prompt the 54-nation organization to reconsider its
peacekeeping role.
	   But an OSCE spokesman, Jorgen Grunnet, told a radio station in
Saarbruecken, Germany on Tuesday that the Kosovo Verification
Mission had no plans to stop its peacekeeping efforts.
	   As a sign of international resolve, NATO Secretary-General
Javier Solana warned the two sides Tuesday ``not to endanger the
fragile security situation.''
	   ``NATO is ready to intervene if the situation requires,'' Solana
said In Brussels, Belgium.
	   Nevertheless, the rhetoric on both sides underscored the
bitterness between Serbs and the ethnic Albanians, who are
demanding independence for the province.
	   The spokesman for the ethnic Albanian rebels, Adem Demaci, said
the guerrillas will respect the cease-fire ``but we will defend
ourselves with all means if necessary.''
	   Yugoslavia's foreign minister demanded that the KLA be declared
a terrorist organization. In a letter to U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan, Foreign Minister Zivadin Jovanovic accused the rebels
of taking advantage of the Oct. 12 agreement to rearm and regroup.
	   The ultra-nationalist Serbian Radical Party, a close ally of
Milosevic, called Tuesday for ``complete extinction of Albanian
terrorist gangs,'' as the only way to solve the crisis in Kosovo.

	   BEIT EL, West Bank (AP) _ An Israeli military court on Tuesday
charged a Palestinian American businessman with funneling money to
the Islamic militant group Hamas.
	   The court said the money went to Adel Awadallah, a top Hamas
fugitive and mastermind of suicide bombings in Israel. Awadallah
was killed in an Israeli commando raid in September.
	   The court ordered Jamil Sarsour held until the end of
proceedings. It was not clear when Sarsour was arrested.
	   Sarsour denied any connection to Hamas. ``I only made a small

Serb official seeks to reassure Kosovo's Serbs about their safety
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Seeking to reassure Kosovo's Serb
population, the province's top-ranking official said Tuesday the
government will not allow ethnic Albanian ``terrorists'' to drive
them from their homes.
	   ``The state will not allow the terrorists to achieve their plan,
which is to `ethnically cleanse' these lands,'' Zoran Andjelkovic
told the municipal council in the northern Kosovo town of Podujevo,
scene of fierce clashes last week between government forces and the
ethnic Albanian Kosovo Liberation Army
	   The government's Tanjug news agency quoted Andjelkovic as saying
the army and the police would continue to ``do all in their power
to protect the people in this part of Serbia.''
	   According to Tanjug, the Serb official said it was not the job
of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe ``to
tell us what to do and how to deal with the terrorists.''
	   ``It is their job only to verify the facts on the ground and
inform their superiors of their findings, and the facts clearly
show that the criminal gangs are terrorizing the civilian
population,''
	   During the visit to the town, Andjelkovic met with families of
Serb civilians who have gone missing from the villages of Velika
Reka, Obrandza and Perane.

Sharon does not rule out bid for prime minister
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with efforts to poach Likud ministers;
fresh quotes &QL; 
 &UR; By RON KAMPEAS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Benjamin Netanyahu's rivals for the prime
ministership on Tuesday openly sought to poach his ministers,
present and past _ bold forays into Netanyahu's power base that
underscored the threat he faces heading into elections.
	   Labor Party leader Ehud Barak exchanged compliments with David
Levy, the head of the Gesher party, and Netanyahu's first foreign
minister. Amnon Shahak, a former military chief-of-staff likely to
head a centrist party, said he hoped to recruit two current
ministers known to be unhappy with Netanyahu's leadership.
	   And in another blow, his closest political ally, Foreign
Minister Ariel Sharon, said he hasn't ruled out running for the
premier's post.
	   Parliament's Law Committee on Tuesday approved May 17 as the
date for new elections, more than a year ahead of schedule.
	   Netanyahu faces a growing field of challengers, including
members of his own Likud Party who either seek to wrest the party's
nomination from him or plan to run on their own slate.
	   With five candidates already in the race and Shahak expected to
announce his bid next week, it is unlikely the elections will be
determined in the first round. If no candidate wins more than 50
percent, a runoff will be held June 1.
	   Shahak _ almost certain to partner with another Likud defector,
Dan Meridor _ said he would welcome Defense Minister Yitzhak
Mordechai and Communications Minister Limor Livnat to their nascent
centrist party.
	   ``I'd be happy to see people like Yitzhak Mordechai and Limor
Livnat,'' Shahak, who leads Netanyahu and Barak in the polls, told
Channel Two news. ``I'd be happy to see anyone who's ready to go
together with the goals we will agree upon together.''
	   Livnat has already met with Meridor, and Mordechai is known to
be unhappy with Netanyahu's decision to freeze the accords with the
Palestinians negotiated at Wye River, Maryland in October.
	   Israel Television reported that Mordechai was in ``intensive
contact'' with Labor leader Barak.
	   Levy, who left Netanyahu's government in January 1998 because of
his unhappiness over social policy and the slow pace of Mideast
peacemaking, said he admired Barak's emphasis on social issues.
	   ``He is the only one who talks about these (social) issues and
presents a new set of priorities,'' he said after meeting with
Barak.
	   Levy would be assured up to four places if he joined with Barak,
Israel television reported. Neither side would confirm the
conditions, or whether an agreement was finalized.
	   Even though Levy has not been in government for a year, his
joining Labor would be a symbolic blow to the Likud.
	   The charismatic union organizer was nudged out of the Labor
movement in the 1950s, largely because he was Moroccan-born and the
movement was overwhelmingly dominated by European Jews.
	   He crossed to Herut _ the Likud's predecessor _ and became a
favorite of founder Menachem Begin. Levy nurtured the party's
following among Jews of Middle Eastern background _ a constituency
that brought Begin from the margins of political life to power in
1977.
	   Labor legislators said their party was Levy's natural home.
	   ``He has a warm place in our hearts,'' Dalia Itzik said.
	   Barak _ who has apologized to Middle Eastern Jews for his
party's past treatment _ described Levy as ``very serious'' and
having ``important influence ... I value him.''
	   Netanyahu on Tuesday prayed at the Western Wall, Judaism's
holiest site, and struck a theme that helped him win in 1996 _ a
pledge to keep Jerusalem united.
	   ``I draw my strength from generations of Jews who dreamed of
returning to this place and staying here,'' Netanyahu said. ``And
this is the major battle that we're fighting right now,'' listing
settlement projects that the Palestinians say violate the Wye
accords.
	   Sharon's acknowledgment on Monday evening that he was
considering a bid for prime minister came as a surprise.
	   On Sunday, he had told Likud's Central Committee that he did
``not want to be prime minister.'' Less than 24 hours later, he
said on a TV talk show that under certain circumstances, he might
enter the race.
	   ``There is a difference between `I don't want to be prime
minister' and running under special circumstances,'' Sharon said.
	   Asked to elaborate on Tuesday, Sharon told reporters: ``Use your
head and you'll understand.''
	   There was speculation he could enter the race if Netanyahu's
popularity drops or key leaders abandon the Likud party.
	   Sharon resigned as defense minister in 1983 after he was held
indirectly responsible for the massacre of hundreds of Palestinians
during Israel's military offensive to chase PLO guerrillas out of
Lebanon.

King Hussein discharged from hospital, says Crown Prince Hassan
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JOHN HALABY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer

<TEXT>
	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ Jordan's King Hussein has been discharged
from an American hospital after treatment for cancer, his brother
Crown Prince Hassan said Tuesday.
	   Hussein, 63, will spend ``a few days'' of convalescence at his
summer residence in suburban Maryland and then fly to London for
more rest before returning home, added the prince.
	   He said: ``As you listen to my words now, His majesty King
Hussein would have left the hospital on board his aircraft,
beginning his journey to the homeland and the Jordanian family he
loves and who loves him.
	   ``I break to you the joyous news that his majesty, ... my dear
and beloved brother, has fully recovered from his illness,'' Hassan
said in a televised speech.
	   The king was admitted to the Mayo Clinic in Rochester Minnesota,
on July 13 with non-Hodgkins lymphoma. He underwent six rounds of
chemotherapy.
	   Mayo Clinic spokeswoman Jane Jacobs said that Hussein was
discharged Tuesday morning.
	   The 51-year-old Hassan quoted a royal message from Hussein as
saying stopovers in Maryland and London were essential to
``regaining my normal strength.''
	   The five-minute speech by Hassan, who has been acting as regent
during his brother's absence, was aimed at calming fears among
Jordanians about a king battling cancer for the second time in six
years. Hussein has ruled for 46 years, making him the longest
reigning Arab ruler.
	   It was not clear exactly when Hussein will return. However,
officials say he is expected home by the Muslim holiday in
mid-January that marks the end of the fasting month of Ramadan.
	   Hassan quoted Hussein as saying he would return to the United
States in March for a medical checkup.

Israeli general says it's `unnatural' for women to be pilots
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS details on ceremony for first woman pilot completing
navigation course, her age, grafs 8-9 &QL; 
 &UR; By LAURIE COPANS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ An Israeli air force general told a
parliamentary committee that it was ``unnatural'' for women to be
pilots, sparking outrage among female legislators.
	   Legislator Marina Solodkin, who chairs the Committee on the
Status of Women, said Tuesday that the comments showed that the air
force has not changed its attitude toward women despite some
reforms.
	   Last year, Israel's Supreme Court ordered the air force to
change its policy of training only men as pilots and to admit women
to the course. One of the new recruits completed a combat
navigation course Tuesday, the first woman to reach such an
advanced stage of training.
	   The latest controversy began Monday when Brig. Gen. Gil Regev
told Solodkin's committee that women don't have the stamina to be
pilots and that the job interferes with child-rearing.
	   ``I'm concerned about the survival rate of the female
soldiers,'' Solodkin quoted Regev as saying. ``I also think it's
not natural for there to be female pilots.''
	   The army spokesman's office wouldn't comment directly on Regev's
alleged statements but said that the air force is implementing the
Supreme Court decision allowing women to train as pilots.
	   ``On Thursday, for the first time, a female candidate will
successfully complete the course,'' the spokesman said.
	   After her graduation on Thursday, Second Lt. Sari, 21 _ a native
of the well-appointed Tel Aviv suburb of Raanana _ will fly F-16's
in northern Israel, Israel TV said. It is army policy to only
release the first names of combat pilots.
	   At a ceremony Tuesday to mark completion of a navigation course,
Sari marched alongside her male colleagues in air force khaki, her
brown hair neatly tied into a single braid. Other women began the
rigorous pilot course with her, but she was the only one to
complete it successfully, Israel TV said.

Puerto Rican governor fudging referendum results, winners complain
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) _ Opponents claim Gov. Pedro
Rossello, an advocate of U.S. statehood for Puerto Rico, is using
government ads to gloss over his defeat in a Dec. 13 referendum on
the issue.
	   The opposition Popular Democratic Party complained Tuesday to
the Puerto Rico Elections Commission and the Comptroller's Office
about State Department ads that imply statehood won, though less
than half of voters chose that option.
	   ``The government of Pedro Rossello is demonstrating its
disregard for the democratic processes and the sentiment of the
majority of the people,'' Sen. Antonio Fas Alzamora said in the
newspaper El Nuevo Dia.
	   The ads claim that through the vote, the Puerto Ricans are
urging the U.S. Congress to end ``100 years of political
subordination'' and clear up the island's ambiguous relationship
with the United States.
	   It lists U.S. statehood coming in first with 728,157 votes,
followed by independence with 39,838 votes.
	   But the winner in the referendum was a ``none of the above''
protest vote backed by supporters of the status quo. It got 787,900
votes, or 50.3 percent, compared to 46.5 percent for U.S.
statehood.
	   The ads list the ``none of the above'' option at the bottom,
grouped with totals for ``null and void'' and ``blank ballots.''
	   Last week, the Elections Commission certified statehood's loss,
despite appeals from Rossello's New Progressive Party.
	   The United States won Puerto Rico from Spain in the 1898
Spanish-American War. Under a commonwealth agreement reached in
1952, Puerto Rican residents are U.S. citizens but cannot vote for
president and have no vote in Congress.
	   They receive federal funds _ though at a lower rate than U.S.
states _ while being allowed some trappings of nationhood, like an
Olympic team.

Israel and Egypt to negotiate supplying Egyptian gas to Israel
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israel and Egypt will negotiate a deal to pipe
Egyptian natural gas to Israel, an Israeli spokesman said Tuesday.
	   Israel's infrastructure ministry told the national electricity
supplier to open negotiations after the Egyptian natural gas
company, EGPC, sent a letter expressing interest in the deal, the
ministry said in a statement.
	   Infrastructure Minister Ariel Sharon, who has protested Egypt's
prohibition against selling gas to Israel, said the letter allows
``serious examination of the possibility of reliable and continuous
gas supply based solely on commerce and economics.''
	   Relations between Israel and Egypt have been strained in recent
months by the deadlock in the Israeli-Palestinian negotiations over
the West Bank and Gaza. Israel and Egypt maintain a `cold peace''
with few commercial or economic ties.
	   Negotiations over price and the quantity of gas to be supplied
were to begin in the next few days, the statement said.

Iraq says it is defying allied-patrolled no-fly zones
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with U.S., British saying no reports of Iraqi flights
over no-fly zones, Iraq Foreign Ministry statement. &QL; 
 &UR; AP Photos BAG 101-103 &QL; 
 &UR; By LOUIS MEIXLER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ A defiant Iraq said Tuesday that its
aircraft are flying in the no-fly zones patrolled by U.S. and
British warplanes and its anti-aircraft batteries remain ready to
fire on allied planes.
	   The statement comes only a day after U.S. warplanes opened fire
on an Iraqi anti-aircraft position in the northern no-fly zone,
killing four Iraqi soldiers. Washington said the planes attacked
after Iraq shot missiles at the aircraft.
	   Iraq's latest move appears to be aimed at building support among
Arabs who angrily protested mid-December's U.S.-British airstrikes
_ but whose governments did little to back Iraq's demands for
lifting eight-year-old U.N. sanctions on the country.
	   Vice President Taha Yassin Ramadan voiced Iraq's latest defiance
when asked in an interview with Associated Press Television News if
Iraq was flying aircraft in the no-fly zones.
	   ``We are doing it right now,'' he replied.
	   ``Iraqi planes in effect are flying in a normal manner in Iraqi
airspace,'' he added.
	   Ramadan did not specify whether the aircraft were military or
civilian, but almost all of Iraq's passenger aircraft are either
out of the country or unusable. All aircraft in Iraq are owned by
the government.
	   U.S. and British military officials expressed skepticism about
Ramadan's assertion that Iraqi planes took to the air.
	   In Washington, Col. Richard Bridges said there were no immediate
reports of Iraqi aircraft in northern and southern no-fly zones.
	   ``We will continue to enforce the no-fly zones,'' said Lt. Col.
Stephen Campbell. ``Nothing has changed.''
	   A spokesman for the British Defense Ministry _ who spoke on
customary condition of anonymity _ also reported no Iraqi air
activity and added Britain was ready to take action ``should the
conditions of the no-fly zones be breached.''
	   The United States and its allies set up no-fly zones in northern
and southern Iraq to protect Kurds and Shiite Muslims from air
attack after forces loyal to President Saddam Hussein put down twin
rebellions in those regions after the 1991 Gulf War.
	   There were no flights over the northern no-fly zone on Tuesday
``strictly due to weather and nothing else,'' said Lt. Col. Jane
Rinell, a U.S. military spokeswoman.
	   A spokesman for the southern zone said flights continued and
``there were no disturbances'' from the Iraqi side.
	   Iraq has never recognized the zones.
	   Iraqi newspapers on Tuesday applauded the public protests in
Arab capitals after the United States and Britain bombed Iraq for
four nights beginning Dec. 16.
	   The airstrikes were ordered after U.N. weapons inspectors
reported Iraq was blocking their work. The U.N. sanctions _ imposed
after Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait _ will not be lifted until the
inspectors declare Iraq is free of weapons of mass destruction.
	   In a front-page editorial, the al-Qadissiya newspaper warned
Arab leaders that ignoring ``the snowballing Arab wrath ... will
shake the ground from under their feet.''
	   Iraqi criticism was especially harsh toward Egyptian President
Hosni Mubarak, who said in an interview published Monday that ``the
ruling regime (in Iraq) is the reason for all the problems ... and
Egypt naturally does not support this regime.''
	   The daily Babil, owned by Saddam's son Odai, compared Mubarak's
comments to ``the panting of a dog.''

	   BEIT EL, West Bank (AP) _ An Israeli military court on Tuesday
charged a Palestinian-American businessman with funneling money to
the Islamic militant group Hamas.
	   The court said money from Jamil Sarsour went to Adel Awadallah,
a top Hamas fugitive and mastermind of suicide bombings in Israel.
Awadallah was killed in an Israeli commando raid in September.
	   The court ordered Sarsour held until the end of proceedings. It
was not clear when he was arrested.
	   Sarsour denied any connection to Hamas. ``I only made a small
contribution to the family (of Awadallah), that's all I did,''
Sarsour, a resident of the West Bank town of Ramallah, told Israel
army radio on Tuesday.
	   The radio said Sarsour gave dlrs 40,000 over two years.
	   Sarsour's hometown in the United States was not immediately
available.
	   The indictment said Sarsour channeled funds to Hamas from the
United States, using an Israeli bank account. The money was cashed
by a 70-year-old woman and was transferred to Awadallah.
	   Awadallah also reportedly asked Sarsour to get him a false
passport or any other identification that would enable him to flee
the country.
	   ``From the investigation it became clear that Awadallah felt the
ring tighten around him,'' the military prosecutor, Sgt. Eli Baon,
said on the radio.
	   Sarsour did not get Awadallah a passport, but did provide him
with other false papers, the radio said.

Israeli general says it's `unnatural' for women to be pilots
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS details on ceremony for first woman pilot completing
navigation course, her age &QL; 
 &UR; By LAURIE COPANS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ An air force general's comments to a
parliamentary committee that it is ``not natural'' for women to be
pilots has sparked outrage among female lawmakers.
	   Legislator Marina Solodkin, who chairs the Committee on the
Status of Women, said Tuesday that the comments showed that the air
force has not changed its attitude toward women despite some
reforms.
	   Last year, Israel's Supreme Court ordered the air force to
change its policy of training only men as pilots and to admit women
to the course. One of the new recruits completed a combat
navigation course Tuesday, the first woman to reach such an
advanced stage of training.
	   The latest controversy began Monday when Brig. Gen. Gil Regev
told Solodkin's committee that women don't have the stamina to be
pilots and that the job interferes with child-rearing.
	   ``I'm concerned about the survival rate of the female
soldiers,'' Solodkin quoted Regev as saying. ``I also think it's
not natural for there to be female pilots.''
	   Regev was not available for comment Tuesday and the army
spokesman's office said only that the air force is implementing the
Supreme Court decision allowing women to train as pilots.
	   ``On Thursday, for the first time, a female candidate will
successfully complete the course,'' the spokesman said.
	   After her graduation on Thursday, Second Lt. Sari, 21 _ a native
of the well-appointed Tel Aviv suburb of Raanana _ will fly F-16's
in northern Israel, Israel TV said. It is army policy to only
release the first names of combat pilots.
	   At a ceremony Tuesday to mark completion of a navigation course,
Sari marched alongside her male colleagues in air force khaki, her
brown hair neatly tied into a single braid. Other women began the
rigorous pilot course with her, but she was the only one to
complete it successfully, Israel TV said.

King Hussein discharged from hospital, says Crown Prince Hassan
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ Jordan's King Hussein has been discharged
from an American hospital after treatment for cancer, his brother
Crown Prince Hassan said Tuesday.
	   Hussein, 63, will spend ``a few days'' of convalescence at his
summer residence in suburban Maryland and then fly to London for
more rest before returning home, added the prince.
	   ``I break to you the joyous news that his majesty, ... my dear
and beloved brother, has fully recovered from his illness,'' Hassan
said in a televised speech.
	   The king was admitted to the Mayo Clinic in Rochester Minnesota,
on July 13 with non-Hodgkins lymphoma. He underwent six rounds of
chemotherapy.
	   Mayo Clinic spokeswoman Jane Jacobs said that Hussein was
discharged Tuesday morning.
	   The 51-year-old Hassan quoted a royal message from Hussein as
saying stopovers in Maryland and London were essential to
``regaining my normal strength.''
	   The five-minute speech by Hassan, who has been acting as regent
during his brother's absence, was aimed at calming fears among
Jordanians about a king battling cancer for the second time in six
years. Hussein has ruled for 46 years, making him the longest
reigning Arab ruler.
	   It was not clear exactly when Hussein will return. However,
officials say he is expected home by the Muslim holiday in
mid-January that marks the end of the fasting month of Ramadan.
	   Hassan quoted Hussein as saying he would return to the United
States in March for a medical checkup.

Debate renewed after furloughed Red Brigades killer escapes
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; By FRANCES D'EMILIO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ The failure of a Red Brigades member serving a life
sentence for a double slaying to return to prison after a Christmas
furlough has fueled the latest debate over Italy's practice of
leniency for some terrorists and other inmates.
	   Investigators said Tuesday it was still possible that Marcello
Ghiringhelli, for personal reasons, just couldn't make it back at
the end of his two-day furlough from a prison near Turin, in
northern Italy.
	   But under Italian law, a prisoner who fails to go back to his
cell more than 24 hours after the furlough ends is considered to
have escaped from prison.
	   In Italy, inmates with good behavior are often granted
permission to work outside prison during the day, as Ghiringhelli
was, or allowed furloughs of several days to stay with family.
	   Ghiringhelli's presumed escape this week came in the middle of
Italy's latest round of debate over how to treat convicts,
especially those linked to the painful decades of terrorism.
	   Last week, President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro granted a Christmas
pardon to a founder of a leftist terrorist group who had served 28
years of a life sentence. Just as happened a year earlier when
Scalfaro had pardoned six convicted terrorists for Christmas,
politicians and commentators immediately began debating about the
wisdom of the practice.
	   A leader of the rightwing National Alliance party, Maurizio
Gasparre, demanded that parliament review the law that allows some
leniency for convicts.
	   Ghiringhelli's disappearance shows the state's ``tenderness
toward he who acted without pity toward the victims,'' said
Maurizzo Puddu, who heads a group of victims of terrorism.
	   Ghiringhelli was convicted of killing two bank security guards
during a 1982 holdup to get cash for the Red Brigades, a far-left
group which claimed kidnappings and killings of politicians and
other officials in the 1970s and 1980s when Italy was gripped by
terrorism by rightwing and leftwing extremists.
	   A former Red Brigades member, Barbara Balzerani, who also was
allowed to work outside prison, said politicians needed once and
for all to decide how to close the books on the terrorist years.
	   ``History is finished with responsibility that's a little
one-way,'' Balzerani was quoted as saying by the Italian news
agency ANSA.
	   The bank guards were shot point-blank in the nape of the neck
after being disarmed and made to lie on the floor.
	   Italy's justice minister, a former Communist, ordered a report
on the Ghiringhelli case.
	   An anti-death penalty group Nobody Touches Cain claimed that
only 1-to-2 percent of inmates on passes fail to return to Italian
prisons.

EU applauds Nicosia's decision on Russian missiles
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ The European Union on Tuesday applauded a
decision by Greek Cypriot President Glafcos Clerides that he was
canceling plans to deploy Russian-made missiles in his island
nation.
	   Austrian Foreign Minister Wolfgang Schuessel said the decision
to scrap the missiles represented ``a great success for quiet
diplomacy'' by the EU, Britain and the United States.
	   Austria currently holds the rotating EU presidency.
	   Schuessel said the Cypriot government appeared to have been
influenced by its desire to join the EU and had made ``a
significant contribution to stability in the region.''
	   The United States and NATO have criticized Clerides' decision
two years ago to purchase the air defense missiles, fearing
conflict between NATO members Turkey and Greece. Athens has a
defense pact with the Greek Cypriots.
	   Turkey had threatened military action if the missiles were
actually deployed. The missiles issue has also caused political
tensions in Cyprus, where the outcome of Tuesday's meeting could
affect the survival of Clerides' government.

	   Earlier there had been confusion over the number of fatalities
and their nationalities, and a high-ranking security official had
said an American woman was among those killed. The U.S. State
Department later said an American was wounded.
	   The Interior Ministry statement said that members of the
``extremist terrorist gang'' kidnapped the 16 Westerners and killed
three of the captives _ two men and a woman.
	   ``They proceeded in killing the captives after refusing any
attempts at negotiations, which led security forces to storm the
area to prevent further bloodshed and ensure the safe release of
the rest of the hostages,'' the statement continued.
	   One of the wounded hostages, a Briton, died later in hospital,

Sharon does not rule out bid for prime minister
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with efforts to poach Likud ministers;
fresh quotes &QL; 
 &UR; By RON KAMPEAS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Benjamin Netanyahu's rivals for the prime
ministership on Tuesday openly sought to poach his ministers,
present and past _ bold forays into Netanyahu's power base that
underscored the threat he faces heading into elections.
	   Labor Party leader Ehud Barak exchanged compliments with David
Levy, the head of the Gesher party, and Netanyahu's first foreign
minister. Amnon Shahak, a former military chief-of-staff likely to
head a centrist party, said he hoped to recruit two current
ministers known to be unhappy with Netanyahu's leadership.
	   And in another blow, his closest political ally, Foreign
Minister Ariel Sharon, said he hasn't ruled out running for the
premier's post.
	   Parliament's Law Committee on Tuesday approved May 17 as the
date for new elections, more than a year ahead of schedule.
	   Netanyahu faces a growing field of challengers, including
members of his own Likud Party who either seek to wrest the party's
nomination from him or plan to run on their own slate.
	   With five candidates already in the race and Shahak expected to
announce his bid next week, it is unlikely the elections will be
determined in the first round. If no candidate wins more than 50
percent, a runoff will be held June 1.
	   Shahak _ almost certain to partner with another Likud defector,
Dan Meridor _ said he would welcome Defense Minister Yitzhak
Mordechai and Communications Minister Limor Livnat to their nascent
centrist party.
	   ``I'd be happy to see people like Yitzhak Mordechai and Limor
Livnat,'' Shahak, who leads Netanyahu and Barak in the polls, told
Channel Two news. ``I'd be happy to see anyone who's ready to go
together with the goals we will agree upon together.''
	   Livnat has already met with Meridor, and Mordechai is known to
be unhappy with Netanyahu's decision to freeze the accords with the
Palestinians negotiated at Wye River, Maryland in October.
	   Israel Television reported that Mordechai was in ``intensive
contact'' with Labor leader Barak.
	   Levy, who left Netanyahu's government in January 1998 because of
his unhappiness over social policy and the slow pace of Mideast
peacemaking, said he admired Barak's emphasis on social issues.
	   ``He is the only one who talks about these (social) issues and
presents a new set of priorities,'' he said after meeting with
Barak.
	   Labor legislators said their party was Levy's natural home.
	   ``He has a warm place in our hearts,'' Dalia Itzik said.
	   Netanyahu on Tuesday prayed at the Western Wall, Judaism's
holiest site, and struck a theme that helped him win in 1996 _ a
pledge to keep Jerusalem united.
	   ``I draw my strength from generations of Jews who dreamed of
returning to this place and staying here,'' Netanyahu said. ``And
this is the major battle that we're fighting right now,'' listing
settlement projects that the Palestinians say violate the Wye
accords.
	   Sharon's acknowledgment on Monday evening that he was
considering a bid for prime minister came as a surprise.
	   On Sunday, he had told Likud's Central Committee that he did
``not want to be prime minister.'' Less than 24 hours later, he
said on a TV talk show that under certain circumstances, he might
enter the race.
	   ``There is a difference between `I don't want to be prime
minister' and running under special circumstances,'' Sharon said.
	   Asked to elaborate on Tuesday, Sharon told reporters: ``Use your
head and you'll understand.''
	   There was speculation he could enter the race if Netanyahu's
popularity drops or key leaders abandon the Likud party.
	   Sharon resigned as defense minister in 1983 after he was held
indirectly responsible for the massacre of hundreds of Palestinians
during Israel's military offensive to chase PLO guerrillas out of
Lebanon.

	   Helicopters were dispatched to the area to evacuate the injured,
said the security official, speaking on customary condition of
anonymity.
	   The kidnapping happened Monday near the southern town of
Mawdiyah, about 200 kilometers (175 miles) south of the Yemen
capital San`a.
	   The hostages included 12 Britons _ six of them women _ two
American women and two Australian men.
	   They were taken when 18 men ambushed a convoy of five vehicles
in which the tourists were traveling and opened fire on their
police escorts. The kidnappers threatened to kill the tourists if
the police did not back off.
	   During the melee, the British tour leader and a Yemeni guide
escaped and raised the alarm.
	   Kidnapping of tourists by tribes is a commonly used method in
Yemen to gain concessions from the government such as new roads,
water supply or clinics. The hostages generally are released
unharmed.
	   But the latest incident marked the first time an abduction was
carried out by Islamic militants. Security officials said the
kidnappers belong to Islamic Jihad, many of whose leaders fought in
Afghanistan and are believed to have connections with Egyptian
Muslim radicals.
	   Earlier Tuesday, Yemeni officials began negotiations with the
Islamic militants for the release of the tourists. Some 200 Yemeni
security forces encircled the area.
	   Gov. Ahmad Ali Mohsen of Abyan province, where the kidnapping
took place, was leading the talks with leaders of the Al-Fadl
tribe, to which the kidnappers belong, an official at the
governor's office said.
	   Mohsen was accompanied by Islamic figures who are influential
with the abductors, the official said, speaking on condition of
anonymity.
	   The kidnappers demanded the release of their leader, Saleh
Haidara al-Atwi, who was arrested two weeks ago as part of a
government crackdown on Islamic vigilantes enforcing strict Islamic
rules in southern Yemen.
	   The kidnappers also wanted the release of another leader, Yemen
security officials said. They did not identify him.
	   They said Islamic Jihad members flogged women for ignoring the
Islamic dress code and men for selling and drinking alcohol, which
is forbidden in Islam.
	   The group, which has no more than 200 members, also ran a
military camp in southern Yemen, the security officials said.
	   Yemen was once a haven for Islamic militant fugitives from other
countries, but the government has expelled many of them.
	   A British couple and their teen-age son were kidnapped in April
but released unharmed a month later.
	   Four Germans currently are being held by a tribe in northeast
Yemen. The kidnappers are demanding more schools, hospitals and
telephone lines in their area.

	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Former Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell
promised Tuesday a ``thorough and prompt'' investigation into
claims that bribes helped Salt Lake City win the 2002 Winter
Olympic Games.
	   Talking with reporters after his initial meeting with members of
a special commission investigating the allegations, Mitchell noted
that the panel has to file its report with the U.S. Olympic
Committee by Feb. 28.
	   Mitchell said the investigation would focus on the circumstances
surrounding the selection of Salt Lake City by the International
Olympic Committee. But he said ``as important, if not more
important'' will be for the panel to make recommendations on
improvements in the bidding process to ensure ``it is fair and
above reproach.''
	   Past and present officials of the Salt Lake City Olympic
Committee have acknowledged that they gave members of the
international committee gifts and paid college tuition to some of
the committee's relatives prior to the city being selected for the
Winter Games.
	   ``I entered this process with a completely open mind both as to
the practices and standards which have been utilized in the past
and those which ought to be utilized,'' he said. ``We owe to them
(the athletes) the obligation to make certain that the games in
which they participate are in fact and are perceived as totally
fair and above reproach.''
	   The allegations also are being reviewed by the U.S. Justice
Department.
	   The IOC is in danger of losing a special tax concession worth
about dlrs 1.4 million a year from the Swiss government because of
the corruption scandal, a Swiss paper reported Tuesday. The
exemption from the Swiss value-added tax was granted to the IOC by
the Swiss government in September. But the lower house of the Swiss
parliament may review that exemption late this month for the
Lausanne-based IOC, the Geneva daily Le Temps reported.

	   SAN`A, Yemen (AP) _ Four Westerners held hostage by militant
Islamic tribesmen were killed on Tuesday as Yemeni security forces
stormed their hideout.
	   A statement issued by Yemen's Interior Ministry said that the
kidnappers killed three of the captives and that a fourth, who was
wounded in the incident, died later in a hospital.
	   In London, British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook said the dead
included three British hostages and an Australian.
	   Earlier there had been confusion over the number of fatalities
and their nationalities, and a high-ranking security official had

	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Former U.S. Senate Majority Leader George

	   After his initial meeting with members of a special commission

	   The allegations also are being investigated by the Justice

to conduct an investigation that is at once thorough and prompt.''
	   Mitchell said the commission's objective was ``to encourage and
enhance and live up to'' the ideals of the Olympic movement.
	   He described the panel's effort as ``a review of the
circumstances surrounding the Salt Lake City bidding process'' as
well as to ``make recommendations to the U.S. Olympic Committee for
its use in future bidding processes, to try to make as certain as
humanly possibly that those processes are fair and above
reproach.''
	   Accusations of scandal and bribery have rocked the Olympic
movement, prompting the IOC to call for the first inquiry, followed
by Salt Lake organizers early this month asking its independent
ethics panel to investigate.
	   The IOC expects to wrap up its own probe by Jan. 23. Salt Lake
organizers, meanwhile, have said its ethics board would report its
findings no later than Feb. 11.
	   Any delays would likely irritate sponsors who pay an increasing
percentage of the multimillion-dollar sports budget and have told
Olympic officials that they want the controversy handled swiftly.
	   Olympic officials have been contacting sponsors to assure them
that action is being taken to maintain the Olympics image of high
ideals and ethics.

Gorbachev: Russia-Belarus ties could be start of new union
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Former Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev praised
the partial merger of Russia and Belarus on Tuesday and spoke
admiringly of Belarus' authoritarian leader, a news agency
reported.
	   Gorbachev said plans to forge closer links between Russia and
its western neighbor could ``become the beginning of a new union,''
although he denied that he supports a return to the Soviet Union,
ITAR-Tass said.
	   Although a union of the countries might hurt Russia
economically, he said, ``Even if we lose, the loss will be
momentary, but in the long run we will surely win.''
	   Presidents Boris Yeltsin of Russia and Alexander Lukashenko of
Belarus have said they would take action to merge some of the
functions of their governments, including defense and foreign
affairs, and that the two would share a common currency.
	   Lukashenko is an authoritarian president who is openly nostalgic
for the Soviet Union. Gorbachev dismissed concerns about him,
saying, ``Alexander Lukashenko is learning on the way,
progressing.''
	   He noted, admiringly, that Lukashenko was the only member of the
Belarusian parliament in 1991 to vote against dissolving the Soviet
Union.
	   Gorbachev spoke to reporters at a news conference marking the
publication of his latest book, ``Thoughts on the Past and
Future.'' Gorbachev speaks out frequently on political affairs, but
his views carry little weight in Russia, where he is widely reviled
for his role in the collapse of the Soviet Union.

President cancels deployment of S-300 missiles

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with more quotes from Clerides, raises
Turkish threat, ADDS European Union comment. &QL;

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) _ President Glafcos Clerides said Tuesday
that he was canceling plans to deploy controversial, Russian-made
missiles in this island nation.
	   His decision was announced in a statement issued at the end of a
meeting of the policy-making Greek Cypriot National Council, which
is composed of political party leaders.
	   The move likely will reduce tensions with Turkey _ which had
threatened to block the missiles' deployment _ but will add to
Cleridis' political troubles since he reversed his own pledge to
put the missiles in place.
	   Other Greek Cypriot leaders insist the SS-300 anti-aircraft
missiles be deployed to counter Turkey's defense of the Turkish
Cypriot northern part of the divided island.
	   Participants at the meeting of party leaders said there were
intense disagreements and that, in the end, Clerides took
responsibility himself for canceling the deployment.
	   Clerides admitted ``that there was lack of unanimity'' at the
meeting.
	   He said he would now negotiate with the Russian government for
the deployment of the missiles on the Greek island of Crete.
	   The announcement in Nicosia followed Clerides' talks in the
Greek capital Athens earlier in the day with Greek Premier Costas
Simitis and Greece's defense and foreign ministers.
	   Cyprus has been divided into a Greek Cypriot-controlled south
and a Turkish-occupied north since 1974, when Turkey invaded after
a short-lived coup by supporters of union with Greece.
	   The United States and NATO have criticized Clerides' decision
two years ago to purchase the missiles, fearing conflict between
NATO members Turkey and Greece. Athens has a defense pact with the
Greek Cypriots.
	   Clerides denied his decision was ``the result of submission to
pressures, threats and blackmail.''
	   ``It was simply a the result of the responsible evaluation ...
of the current conditions and factors affecting the national
cause,'' he said.
	   The outcome of Tuesday's meeting could affect the survival of
Clerides' government.
	   The Socialist EDEK party, which holds the ministries of defense
and education, has warned it will withdraw from the government if
the missiles are not deployed as planned.
	   Other opposition parties maintain Clerides should resign,
following his promise to do so if the missiles are not deployed.
	   The Cypriot president had said previously that he would cancel
the missiles' deployment only if Turkey accepted his
demilitarization proposal or if there was progress in the
U.N.-sponsored talks for the reunification of the island.
	   A U.N. Security Council resolution adopted unanimously last week
called for a reduction of weapons and troops in Cyprus and the
resumption of the talks.
	   On Tuesday, the European Union applauded the cancellation of the
missile deployment. Austrian Foreign Minister Wolfgang Schuessel _
whose country holds the rotating EU presidency _ said the decision
represented ``a great success for quiet diplomacy'' by the EU,
Britain and the United States.

United Nations urges probe into Angola crash, UN identifies

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The Security Council urged the Angolan
government and UNITA rebels on Tuesday to immediately grant U.N.
forces access to the site of a downed U.N.-chartered plane to
determine the fate of the 14 people on board.
	   ``Any further delay jeopardizes the lives of possible
survivors,'' the council said in a statement to the press read by
the president, Jassim Mohammed Buallay.
	   The C-130 transport plane, chartered by the U.N. Observer
Mission in Angola, crashed Saturday 10 minutes after takeoff in the
bush near the central highland city of Huambo, about 500 kilometers
(310 miles) southeast of the Angolan capital Luanda.
	   The United Nations immediately asked that the government and
UNITA grant safe passage to a search and rescue team to get to the
site but hasn't yet received a positive response from either side,
officials said Tuesday.
	   The area is the site of renewed fighting between the government
and UNITA that has shattered the 1994 U.N.-brokered peace accord
that sought to end two decades of civil war in the former
Portuguese colony.
	   U.N. officials said Tuesday the plane's owner, TransAfric, flew
another plane high over the site and saw that it was seemingly
intact. But a U.N. spokesman in Luanda, Hamadoun Toure, said there
was only a ``very, very minor chance'' of survivors being found.
	   The council was particularly concerned that neither side had
taken effective action after the disappearance of three other
planes over UNITA territory, Buallay said. He did not elaborate on
the incidents.
	   A government plane was shot down Dec. 14, but the military
hasn't said who was responsible.
	   ``Council members renew their appeal to the government of Angola
and UNITA to guarantee the safety and freedom of movement of MONUA
personnel and encourage the secretary-general to take additional
steps to ensure adequate security and protection for its
personnel,'' Buallay said.
	   The United Nations identified the 14 passengers and crew
Tuesday:
	   Jose Data and Dala Antonio, both of Angola and both contract
employees of Dinacom, which works with the United Nations. Members
of the U.N. team include Rui Cameling of Angola, Assa Salaam Galal
of Egypt, Wilfried Mateka of Cameroon, Margaret Zulu of Zambia, Lt.
Paulus Willem of Namibia, Patrick Luckman of Australia, Oleg
Kapturovic and Savin S. of Russia. The crew include Capt. John
Wilkinson of South Africa, Carlos Alberto Constantino Tavares Da
Silba of Angola, Carlos Melgar of Bolivia and Benjamin Montefalcon
of the Philippines.

Crumbling coalition musters budget bill through parliament
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ After months of political wrangling, Israel's
parliament on Tuesday gave preliminary approval to a budget bill
that is the backbone of the proposed 1999 state budget.
	   The government had already canceled three votes on the ancillary
budget bill for fear that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu's fractured coalition could not muster the support
necessary to approve it. When it finally came before the Knesset
Monday, lawmakers defeated it by a tie vote of 55-55.
	   In Tuesday's re-vote, the Knesset approved the bill 46 to 37.
	   Defeating the budget is traditionally a sign of no-confidence in
the government, but the Knesset has already indicated that by
voting last week to dissolve itself and hold early elections on May
17.
	   The Knesset's failure to approve the bill had prevented
lawmakers from moving ahead with deliberations on the 1999 state
budget.
	   By law, the Knesset must approve a budget by midnight Thursday,
but passage is unlikely by then because the spending plan still has
several political obstacles to hurdle.
	   The Knesset has to approve both the ancillary bill and the
actual budget bill in two more readings. Before that, the bills
head back to the Knesset Finance Committee, where political parties
traditionally try to wrest concessions in exchange for supporting
the budget.
	   The budget bill itself passed by a sliver-thin 54-53 vote in a
first reading in early November.
	   Israel's budget has fallen victim this year to a riven coalition
whose members withheld support to press political and budgetary
demands on Netanyahu.
	   The political wrangling over the budget was a major factor
Finance Minister Yaakov Neeman resigned earlier this month.

Direct foreign investment in Russia plunges
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia attracted dlrs 2 billion in foreign direct
investment in 1998, only about half what was invested the year
before, a news agency reported Tuesday, citing an Economics
Ministry official.
	   The relatively paltry foreign capital inflows, given the
country's size, reflected investors' concerns over the Russian
economy, heightened by the recent financial crisis and the ruble's
collapse, Vladimir Yefimov said.
	   ``Unfortunately, this is a very small volume given the state of
our industry,'' Yefimov told the ITAR-Tass news agency.
	   By comparison, foreign direct investments in Poland, the Czech
Republic and Hungary, whose combined population of almost 60
million is less than half that of Russia, will total about dlrs
11.4 billion in 1998.
	   Direct foreign investment in Russia reached dlrs 3.9 billion in
1997 before collapsing this year. Yefimov predicted that direct
investment _ that is, investment directly in companies, as opposed
to stocks or other financial instruments _ would reach dlrs 2.5
billion in 1999.
	   With the Russian economy plagued by barter, most Russian
manufactures are cash-starved and use obsolete equipment, producing
goods that often fail to compete with more expensive imports.
	   Given the size of the market, many foreign corporations were
willing to overcome endless hurdles to come in Russia in early
1990s, betting on the economy's turnaround by the end of the
century.
	   In light of the economic crisis that gripped the country after
the ruble was devalued in August, that turnaround seems more remote
than ever. The government expects the economy to have shrunk about
5 percent in 1998 after posting modest signs of recovery in 1997.
	   Investors prefer countries that are open, stable and provide
promising return on their capital, Yefimov said.

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Saying they were ``very sorry'' but
refusing to accept responsibility, two top Khmer Rouge leaders
asked Cambodians to ``let bygones be bygones'' Tuesday and forget
about the genocide of the 1970s.
	   Khieu Samphan and Nuon Chea were flown by helicopter from a
former rebel stronghold to the capital to defect _ in effect,
surrender _ to Prime Minister Hun Sen after he pledged they would
not face trial for crimes against humanity.
	   At a news conference, they were asked by journalists _ many of
them Cambodians who lost family members _ if they felt any remorse
for causing the deaths of as many as 2 million of their countrymen
out of a population of about 9 million.
	   ``Yes, sorry, very sorry,'' Khieu Samphan said, looking red and
sullen.
	   ``We would like to apologize and ask our compatriots to forget
the past so our nation can concentrate on the future,'' Khieu
Samphan said. ``Let bygones be bygones.''
	   The Maoist revolutionaries won a civil war in 1975 and forced
the population into slave labor camps. One Cambodian in five
perished from overwork, starvation, disease and executions.
	   Khieu Samphan called the nightmare _ laid out in his doctoral
thesis as a communist student in Paris in 1959 _ a ``historical
experiment.''
	   The Khmer Rouge were overthrown in 1979 by a Vietnamese
invasion, but spent two decades waging civil war. Stalemate ended
in 1996 when the government began offering pardons to leaders and
guerrillas to get them to make peace.
	   With the movement all but extinct, calls are being heard for
someone to finally be held accountable.
	   The defections of Khieu Samphan and Nuon Chea have no bearing on
the military situation. Only one leader, Ta Mok, remains at large
with an estimated 100 loyalists.
	   Hun Sen's reversal of previous support for a tribunal and the
warm reception given the Khmer Rouge leaders was met with shock by
the human rights group Amnesty International.
	   ``It's a black day for the Cambodian people and a black day for
international justice,'' group representative Demelza Stubbings
said.
	   Khieu Samphan was the nominal Khmer Rouge leader, though he is
viewed as a front-man for the notorious Pol Pot and others who held
real power. Nuon Chea was seen as Pol Pot's second-in-command and
chief theorist. Pol Pot died in April of a heart attack.
	   Neither accepted personal responsibility Tuesday at the news
conference before as hostile an audience as they are ever likely to
face now that a trial is out.
	   Demands were shouted by some reporters for personal apologies to
the families of those who perished.
	   Nuon Chea, asked who was to blame for the massacres, said:
``Let's consider that an old issue. I cannot clarify that.''
	   ``We are very sorry, not just for the human lives, but also
animal lives that were lost in the war,'' Nuon Chea said.
	   Khieu Samphan indicated there would be no trial, especially one
abroad by an international tribunal. The United Nations recently
sent a team of experts to weigh the possibility of such a court.
	   ``Please let the Cambodian people resolve this problem,'' Khieu
Samphan said.
	   ``If we have to say who was wrong and who was right, etc., etc.,
we cannot have national reconciliation,'' Khieu Samphan said. ``We
cannot put an end to the war.''
	   But U.S. officials still insist that they should be held
accountable for their actions before an appropriate tribunal and
noted that ``while there have been a number of conflicting
statements from Cambodian authorities, we note that Prime Minister
Hun Sen has not ruled out the possibility of a trial.''
	   Neither man looked well after months on the run when rebel areas
came under government control. Nuon Chea, 71, walked with a cane.
Khieu Samphan, 67, needed help up the stairs.
	   Khieu Samphan's normally white hair was dyed black in an
apparent attempt at disguise.
	   In the five-hours meeting with Hun Sen, they were joined by
leading members of the Cambodian People's Party. Like Hun Sen, many
were once Khmer Rouge cadres before fleeing murderous purges in the
late 1970s.
	   The pair later called on Prince Norodom Ranariddh, president of
the National Assembly and son of King Norodom Sihanouk. Hun Sen
says that both have approved the defections.
	   It was Nuon Chea's first visit to the capital since the Khmer
Rouge were overthrown in 1979 by a Vietnamese invasion.
	   Khieu Samphan came to Phnom Penh in 1991 after a peace treaty _
later broken by the Khmer Rouge _ was signed. He was stoned by a
Hun Sen-controlled mob.

Four Westerners killed in bloody end to Yemen kidnapping

<TEXT>
	   SAN`A, Yemen (AP) _ The kidnapping of 16 Western tourists in
Yemen ended with the deaths of four hostages Tuesday as security
forces confronted the Islamic extremist captors.
	   A statement issued by Yemen's Interior Ministry said that the
kidnappers killed three of the captives and that a fourth, who was
wounded in the incident, died later in hospital.
	   It was not immediately clear if the fourth victim, a British
man, had been harmed by the kidnappers or wounded in the shootout
between the Islamic extremists and some 200 Yemen security forces.
	   The Interior Ministry said that all of the dead were British.
But in London, British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook said the dead
included three British hostages and an Australian.
	   Cook also urged British nationals to leave Yemen.
	   Two others _ British and American women _ were hospitalized with
injuries, the ministry said.
	   The Interior Ministry said that three of the kidnappers also
were killed and that one of them was an Egyptian national.
	   Earlier reports said a policeman was killed and three wounded in
the shootout.
	   The tourists were kidnapped on Monday near the southern town of
Mawdiyah, about 200 kilometers (175 miles) south of the Yemen
capital San`a.
	   Their convoy of five vehicles was ambushed by men who opened
fire on their police escorts. The kidnappers threatened to kill the
tourists if the police did not back off, Yemen security officials
said.
	   Tribesmen in unruly Yemen have frequently kidnapped tourists to
pressure the government into providing them with new roads, water
supply or clinics. But the hostages generally have been treated as
guests and released unharmed.
	   Four Germans are being held at present by a tribe in northeast
Yemen. The kidnappers are demanding more schools, hospitals and
telephone lines in their area.
	   The latest incident marked the first time an abduction was
carried out by Islamic extremists.
	   Security officials said the kidnappers belong to Islamic Jihad,
many of whose leaders fought Russian troops in Afghanistan. The
group is believed to have about 200 members.
	   The Interior Ministry statement said that members of the
``extremist terrorist gang'' killed three of the captives _ two men
and a woman.
	   ``They proceeded in killing the captives after refusing any
attempts at negotiations, which led security forces to storm the
area to prevent further bloodshed and ensure the safe release of
the rest of the hostages,'' the statement continued.
	   One of the wounded hostages, a Briton, died later in hospital,
the statement said.
	   The bodies of the slain tourists and the injured were ferried by
government helicopter to the Republican Hospital in the southern
port city of Aden, security officials said.
	   The other tourists were escorted by troops to a hotel in Aden,
they said.
	   After the shootout, security forces detained scores of suspected
Islamic extremists, the officials said. All spoke on condition
their names not be used.
	   The kidnappers had demanded the release of their leader, Saleh
Haidara al-Atwi, who was detained two weeks ago as part of a
government crackdown on Islamic vigilantes enforcing strict Islamic
rules in southern Yemen, Yemen security officials said.
	   Islamic Jihad members reportedly were flogging women who did not
observe the Islamic dress code and men for selling and drinking
alcohol, which is forbidden in Islam.
	   The kidnappers also wanted the release of another leader, the
officials said. They did not identify him.
	   The group also ran a military camp in southern Yemen, security
officials said.
	   Yemen was once a haven for Islamic militant fugitives from other
countries, but the government has expelled many of them.
	   Before the shootout, Yemeni officials tried to negotiate with
the Islamic extremists for the release of the tourists as Yemeni
security forces encircled the area.
	   Ahmad Ali Mohsen, governor of Abyan province, where the
kidnapping took place, was leading the talks with leaders of the
Al-Fadl tribe, to which the kidnappers belong, an official at the
governor's office said.
	   A London-based Islamic human rights group said Tuesday that it
had contacted the kidnappers late Monday and received assurances
that they would not harm the hostages.
	   ``They promised not to harm the hostages,'' said a spokesman for
the Islamic Observation Center. ``We hold the Yemeni government
responsible for the deaths. The way the authorities handled the
situation was barbaric and irresponsible.''

Rebels attack police post, battle militias
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) _ As peace talks approached, leftist
rebels attacked a police post and battled with right-wing
paramilitary fighters, authorities said Tuesday.
	   The fighting was taking place a week before negotiations between
the guerrillas and President Andres Pastrana, who is hoping to end
the 34-year conflict. The talks set for Jan. 7 are going forward
without a cease-fire.
	   Police said one officer was killed and three others were wounded
when rebels from the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or
FARC, overran a garrison in Nutibara, a village 190 miles (310
kilometers) northwest of Bogota in Antioquia state.
	   Nine officers were missing in the overnight assault, in which
rebels also blew up an electrical power station, burned down
civilian homes and downed a bridge, police said.
	   The men may have been kidnapped by the rebels, who previously
held about 350 police and soldiers seized in attacks during the
past two years
	   In separate fighting, clashes were also reported Tuesday between
the FARC and paramilitary groups in northern Cordoba state, a
stronghold of right-wing militias.
	   Army leaders denied rumors that Carlos Castano_ the fugitive
chief of the United Self-defense Forces of Colombia _ was killed
during the combat in Murrucucu, a town 255 miles (410 kilometers)
northwest of Bogota.
	   Report's of Castano's death ``have no basis in reality,'' armed
services chief Gen. Fernando Tapias told a news conference.
	   The rumors swept the local media Tuesday after a well-known
militia confidant said in a radio interview that Castano had
``disappeared'' after guerrillas overran a fortified paramilitary
base.

Dino Radja and Bodiroga lead East to Euro All-Star win

<TEXT>
	   BERLIN (AP) _ Former Celtics player Dino Radja and Dejan
Bodiroga Tuesday hit key baskets down the stretch Tuesday as the
East beat the West in the European All-Star game.
	   It was Bodiroga, although he had several former NBA players as
teammates, who poured in six straight points that wiped out a
two-point West lead with 3:20 left as the East won 104-98.
	   Bodiroga, playing for Greece's Panathinaikos Athen, scored 15
points for the East in a match played under near NBA-like rules
including a 24-second clock.
	   Radja led the team with 17 and dunked twice with time running
out to kill the West's last hopes.
	   Carlton Myers of Italy's TeamSystem Bologna was the game MVP
after hitting for 20 points while former Miami Heat player Pedrag
Danilovic added 19.
	   For a while it appeared Myers and Danilovic, who had 16 of his
points in the second half, would break the West jinx. The East has
now won all three editions of the all-star contest.
	   Danilovic, of Italy's Kinder Bologna, poured in nine points as
the West went on an 18 to 10 run to start the second half that put
them up 69-65.
	   Myers, who also won the three-point contest at halftime, then
took over by firing threes.
	   A crowd of 7,500 watching the match came hoping to see
spectacular moves in a game -- that like most all-star contests --
didn't really heat up until the fourth quarter.
	   Fenerbahnce Istanbul's Conrad McRae set the crowd buzzing when
he missed a power dunk that shook the rim and would have given the
East a 82-81 lead.

	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Benjamin Netanyahu's rivals for the prime
ministership on Tuesday openly sought to poach his ministers,
present and past _ bold forays into Netanyahu's power base that
underscored the threat he faces heading into elections.
	   Labor Party leader Ehud Barak exchanged compliments with David
Levy, the head of the Gesher party, and Netanyahu's first foreign
minister. Amnon Shahak, a former military chief-of-staff likely to
head a centrist party, said he hoped to recruit two current
ministers known to be unhappy with Netanyahu's leadership.
	   In two other blows, his closest political ally, Foreign Minister
Ariel Sharon, said he hasn't ruled out running for the premier's
post; and Agriculture Minister Rafael Eitan announced his
candidacy, saying that Israel needed a prime minister more

President cancels deployment of S-300 missiles
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with more quotes from Clerides, raises
Turkish threat, ADDS European Union comment. &QL; 
 &UR; By ALEX EFTY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) _ President Glafcos Clerides said Tuesday
that he was canceling plans to deploy controversial, Russian-made
missiles in this island nation.
	   His decision was announced in a statement issued at the end of a
meeting of the policy-making Greek Cypriot National Council, which
is composed of political party leaders.
	   The move likely will reduce tensions with Turkey _ which had
threatened to block the missiles' deployment _ but will add to
Cleridis' political troubles since he reversed his own pledge to
put the missiles in place.
	   Other Greek Cypriot leaders insist the SS-300 anti-aircraft
missiles be deployed to counter Turkey's defense of the Turkish
Cypriot northern part of the divided island.
	   Participants at the meeting of party leaders said there were
intense disagreements and that, in the end, Clerides took
responsibility himself for canceling the deployment.
	   Clerides admitted ``that there was lack of unanimity'' at the
meeting.
	   He said he would now negotiate with the Russian government for
the deployment of the missiles on the Greek island of Crete.
	   The announcement in Nicosia followed Clerides' talks in the
Greek capital Athens earlier in the day with Greek Premier Costas
Simitis and Greece's defense and foreign ministers.
	   Cyprus has been divided into a Greek Cypriot-controlled south
and a Turkish-occupied north since 1974, when Turkey invaded after
a short-lived coup by supporters of union with Greece.
	   The United States and NATO have criticized Clerides' decision
two years ago to purchase the missiles, fearing conflict between
NATO members Turkey and Greece. Athens has a defense pact with the
Greek Cypriots.
	   Clerides denied his decision was ``the result of submission to
pressures, threats and blackmail.''
	   ``It was simply a the result of the responsible evaluation ...
of the current conditions and factors affecting the national
cause,'' he said.
	   The outcome of Tuesday's meeting could affect the survival of
Clerides' government.
	   The Socialist EDEK party, which holds the ministries of defense
and education, has warned it will withdraw from the government if
the missiles are not deployed as planned.
	   Other opposition parties maintain Clerides should resign,
following his promise to do so if the missiles are not deployed.
	   The Cypriot president had said previously that he would cancel
the missiles' deployment only if Turkey accepted his
demilitarization proposal or if there was progress in the
U.N.-sponsored talks for the reunification of the island.
	   A U.N. Security Council resolution adopted unanimously last week
called for a reduction of weapons and troops in Cyprus and the
resumption of the talks.
	   On Tuesday, the European Union applauded the cancellation of the
missile deployment. Austrian Foreign Minister Wolfgang Schuessel _
whose country holds the rotating EU presidency _ said the decision
represented ``a great success for quiet diplomacy'' by the EU,
Britain and the United States.

Gulf states hold meeting over disagreements on Iraq
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   RIYADH, Saudi Arabia (AP) _ Foreign ministers from Gulf
Cooperation Council states met Tuesday in Riyadh in a special
session intended to resolve differences over convening an Arab
League meeting on Iraq.
	   A meeting of the 22-member league was postponed Monday, two days
before it was to consider calling an Arab summit on the plight of
the Iraqis following the U.S.-British airstrikes in mid-December.
	   Holding a summit remains a divisive issue among Arab leaders
since they disagree over whether to let Iraq back into the Arab
fold eight years after it invaded neighboring Kuwait in 1990 and
set off the Gulf War.
	   Egypt's Middle East News Agency reported in Cairo that the
meeting ended late Tuesday night but that no official communique
would be issued.
	   The session was held under extreme secrecy, without Saudi
officials announcing the arrival of foreign ministers from the
other states in the six-nation GCC.
	   The GCC groups Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates,
Oman, Bahrain and Qatar in a federation for economic development
and defense.
	   A Gulf diplomat, who spoke on customary condition of anonymity,
said postponement of the league meeting was the main reason for
differences among the GCC states.
	   The diplomat said some members were angered that Saudi Arabia's
foreign minister, Prince Saud al-Faisal, visited Cairo on Sunday to
ask Egypt to back the kingdom's request that any meeting be put off
until after Ramadan. He said they felt the trip should not have
been made without consultation with other GCC members.
	   Muslims fast from dawn to dusk during Ramadan, which
commemorates Mohammed's receiving the Koran from God. The holy
month ends in mid-January.
	   On Tuesday, Iraq's Foreign Ministry criticized the delay in the
league meeting, saying the Arab leaders were ignoring the feelings
of their people who demonstrated through much of the Arab world
against the U.S-British attacks.

Turkey nearly halves inflation in 1998 to 56 percent
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ Turkey succeeded in nearly halving its
inflation rate this year, bringing it down to 56 percent, Finance
Minister Zekeriya Temizel announced Tuesday.
	   Slashing at inflation _ the worst woe of Turkey's developing but
uncertain economy _ was one of the main economic targets of the
minority government led by center-right leader Mesut Yilmaz.
	   Yilmaz was ousted last month after 17 months in power over
allegations that he entertained ties with the mob and tampered with
the sale of a state bank. He is the acting premier until the next
government is formed.
	   His government, which gained the praise of the International
Monetary Fund with its rigorous fiscal policies, aimed at reducing
wholesale inflation to 50 percent from the 97 percent of 1997.
	   Meanwhile, a commission gathering governmental officials, trade
unionists and employers, announced Tuesday that the monthly minimum
wage would increase on Jan. 1 to some 78 million Turkish lira (dlrs
251) gross, twice the amount compared to the minimum wage set in
January 1998.

Rome takes step towards fourth cell phone license
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ The Italian government on Tuesday moved one step
closer to assigning a fourth cellular phone license with a request
to the premier to get the groundwork going for the bidding process.
	   The communications ministry said Minister Salvatore Cardinale
asked for a ministerial committee to be set up to choose advisers
and oversee the bidding process. A fourth license is generally
expected to be assigned in mid-1999.
	   Current holders of Italian cellular phone licenses are Telecom
Italia Mobile SpA; Omnitel, controlled by Olivetti SpA and
Mannesmann AG, and the WIND consortium, made up of Deutsche
Telekom, France Telecom and the Italian electricity group ENEL.
	   Swisscom AG, the Picienne consortium and the Telon consortium
have all expressed an interest in competing in the bidding process.

President cancels deployment of S-300 missiles

<TEXT>
	   NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) _ President Glafcos Clerides said Tuesday
that he was canceling plans to deploy controversial, Russian-made
missiles in this island nation.
	   His decision was announced in a statement issued at the end of a
meeting of the policy-making Greek Cypriot National Council, which
is composed of political party leaders.
	   The move likely will reduce tensions with Turkey _ which had
threatened to block the missiles' deployment _ but will add to
Clerides' political troubles since he reversed his own pledge to

	   Other Greek Cypriot leaders insist the S-300 anti-aircraft

Cypriot northern part of the divided island.
	   Participants at the meeting of party leaders said there were
intense disagreements and that, in the end, Clerides took
responsibility himself for canceling the deployment.
	   Clerides admitted ``that there was lack of unanimity'' at the
meeting.
	   He said he would now negotiate with the Russian government for
the deployment of the missiles on the Greek island of Crete.
	   The announcement in Nicosia followed Clerides' talks in the
Greek capital Athens earlier in the day with Greek Premier Costas
Simitis and Greece's defense and foreign ministers.
	   Simitis later issued a statement saying the Greek government
``fully supports'' Clerides' decision. He said the missile
deployment in Crete would still serve the defensive interests of
Greece and Cyprus.
	   In Ankara, Turkish Foreign Minister Ismail Cem called the Greek
Cypriot move a victory for Turkey's refusal to waiver.
	   ``The S-300 issue was a play badly schemed by Greece, badly

Actor Hurd Hatfield of ``Dorian Gray'' fame dies at 80
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CORK, Ireland (AP) _ Hurd Hatfield, the American leading man
famed for his portrayal of the title character in the Oscar-winning
``The Picture of Dorian Gray,'' has died.
	   Hatfield died at a friend's house in Monkstown, Ireland, on
Friday, the Cork Examiner newspaper said. He was 80.
	   A New York native, Hatfield had lived in Ireland since the early
1970s.
	   He never escaped from his portrayal in the movie version of
Oscar Wilde's novel about how the vanity of a society dandy returns
to haunt him in the form of a portrait of him that ages while he
remains eternally youthful, seeing the world he loves decaying
around him.
	   Hatfield was forever associated with that role he played
opposite Angela Landsbury in 1945, despite his having appeared in
20 other movies and scores of television and stage productions.
	   ``That accursed role. Why is he still all anyone ever sees?'' he
reportedly told The Guardian newspaper in an interview in 1992, 40
years after the movie was released.
	   ``They forget everything else, all the other parts _ ``The Count
of Monte Cristo,'' ``Crimes of the Heart'' with Sissy Spacek, ``The
Left Handed Gun'' with Paul Newman _ all they remember is Dorian
Gray,'' he said.
	   It is said that when casting for the film in 1944, director
Albert Lewins took one look at Hatfield and exclaimed: ``Look, it
is him! It is Dorian Gray!''
	   Hatfield told The Guardian he always thought he was miscast in
that role, adding that he had no confidence in his appearance.
	   ``I almost walked away. Isn't that funny, I wonder what would
have happened in my life,'' he said.
	   William Rukard Hurd Hatfield was born Dec. 7 1918 and came to
England to study acting at the Chekhov Theater Studio in
Devonshire.
	   He made his Hollywood debut in ``Dragon Seed'' in 1944. ``The
Picture of Dorian Gray'' was his second movie. He won an Emmy
nomination for best supporting actor for ``The Invincible Mr.
Disraeli'' in 1963.
	   Friends said a private service was planned for Wednesday and
that Hatfield was to be cremated on Thursday, the Cork Examiner
said.
	   His ashes were to be scattered in the grounds of his home in
Rothcormac, in County Cork, the newspaper said. A public memorial
service will be planned for sometime after the new year.
	   No immediate family members were named as survivors.

The battles around Podujevo: preparations for the spring
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: REWRITES and RECASTS throughout, no pick up &QL; 
 &UR; By VESELIN TOSHKOV &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PODUJEVO, Yugoslavia (AP) _ In the snowy hills of northern
Kosovo, both Serbs and ethnic Albanians fear that the four days of
fighting which raged here last week were a dress rehearsal for
fiercer battles to come.
	   Clashes that erupted here Christmas Eve added at least 15 people
to the more than 1,000 dead in Kosovo since February, when Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic launched a crackdown on
independence-minded ethnic Albanians.
	   Last week's clashes were halted by international monitors sent
to Kosovo under an agreement reached Oct. 12 between Milosevic and
U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke to end seven months of fighting.
	   But the bitterness remains. Ethnic Albanian rebels appear
gearing up for a new round of fighting, possibly in the spring. And
Serb civilians are anxious for the government to finish off the
rebels, regardless of threats of NATO intervention.
	   ``Soon, there will be no Serbs here unless the state takes
measures and finishes off with these bandits and savages,'' said
local Serb official Srboslav Bisercic, referring to the Kosovo
Liberation Army.
	   Although this area has been quiet for the past two days, ethnic
Albanian rebels show no signs of backing down. If the rebels
capture Podujevo, they would control the main highway between
Kosovo's capital Pristina and the heartland of Serbia, Yugoslavia's
main republic.
	   KLA trenches lie only a few hundred meters (yards) away from the
30-kilometer (20-mile) road linking Podujevo with the provincial
capital Pristina.
	   ``The KLA will do everything to keep these positions,'' said
Fehim Rexhepi, an ethnic Albanian journalist who reports on the
rebel movement.
	   Caught in the middle are the hundreds of unarmed monitors sent
by the 54-nation Organization for Security and Cooperation in
Europe to verify compliance with the Oct. 12 truce.
	   On Tuesday, OSCE said 100 additional verifiers were on their way
to Kosovo, bringing to 700 the number deployed in the province to
help keep the peace. In a few weeks, OSCE expects to have the full
compliment of 2,000 verifiers in the Serbian province.
	   But critics among both the Serb and ethnic Albanian communities
have questioned whether unarmed verifiers can long contain a
conflict, given the bitterness on both sides.
	   On Tuesday, the chief Serb official in Kosovo, Zoran
Andjelkovic, told local Serbs here that the OSCE verifiers have no
business telling the government ``what to do and how to deal with
the terrorists.''
	   ``It is their job only to verify the facts on the ground and
inform their superiors of their findings,'' Andjelkovic said. ``And
the facts clearly show that the criminal gangs are terrorizing the
civilian population.''
	   The Serb-led government fears that the Oct. 12 agreement has
given the ethnic Albanian rebels time to regroup, retrain and
prepare for more battles when warmer weather will enable them to
smuggle more weapons and fighters across the snow-covered passes
from their sanctuaries in Albania.
	   According to Rexhepi, the guerrillas have already reorganized
and increased their presence in the Podujevo area. He estimates
that the KLA has deployed between 2,000 and 3,000 guerrillas around
this town.
	   He said total KLA strength has grown to about 6,000
province-wide since the Oct. 12 agreement.
	   ``They are more disciplined, better equipped and prepared for
any battle than they were several months ago,'' Rexhepi said.
	   Many of the villages in the Podujevo area are deserted, except
for uniformed KLA fighters. They are particularly strong in the
nearby village of Lapastica, where hundreds of ethnic Albanian
refugees have fled in wake of the latest fighting.
	   In Podujevo, 2 kilometers (1.5 miles) northeast of Lapastica,
Serbs are anxious and fearful of what will happen to them in the
coming months.
	   On Tuesday, a group of nervous Serb men smoked cigarettes as
they waited for news on a police effort to evacuate civilians from
rebel territory.
	   ``My mother and father are there,'' one Serb said, refusing to
give his name. ``They wouldn't listen to me when I told them to
evacuate in time.''
	   Another cursed the West for pressuring the government to halt
the crackdown in October. ``Our hands are tied,'' he said. ``The
world is against us.''

ETA-linked party &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: LEADS to UPDATE with the voting results and Ibarretxe elected &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   VITORIA, Spain (AP) _ A moderate pro-Basque independence
candidate was Tuesday elected premier of the new regional
government with the help of deputies linked to the armed separatist
group ETA.
	   Juan Jose Ibarretxe from the Basque Nationalist Party was
elected lehendakari _ a Basque word for president _ with 40 votes
in favor, 18 against and 15 abstentions in the 75-seat regional
parliament in the Basque town of Vitoria. Two deputies were absent.
	   Ibarretxe's election follows a pact signed Saturday between his
party and the minority Euskal Alkartasuna, which aimed at
establishing the first entirely pro-independence coalition
government since the region gained autonomous status in 1979,
following the death of dictator Gen. Francisco Franco.
	   But Ibarretxe's election, and the pact's survival, required the
support of the radical pro-independence grouping Euskal Herritarrok
that is dominated by Herri Batasuna _ long recognized as ETA's
political wing.
	   Hours before the final vote, Arnaldo Otegi, spokesman and one of
the 14 deputies of Euskal Herritarrok said the coalition was going
to give its support to Ibarretxe.
	   Ibarretxe struck the sharing deal with Euskal Alkartasuna, which
has 6 seats and the radical coalition Euskal Herritarrok with 14.
The two parties' 20 seats, added to Basque Nationalist Party's 21
seats, assured Ibarretxe of winning election as lehendakari.
	   Ibarretxe centered his address on the fledgling Basque peace
process founded in ETA's observance of an unlimited cease-fire
since September, and the conservative government of Prime Minister
Jose Maria Aznar's gradual softening of its anti-negotiation
stance.
	   ``We are all Basques, we all have responsibility and we must
also all participate in the construction of peace,'' Ibarretxe told
the Basque parliament.
	   ``Dialogue without exclusion and without conditions and with
respect for the decisions taken by Basques is the key, and nothing
else,'' Ibarretxe said referring to a peace plan signed by Basque
nationalists just before ETA called its truce.
	   Known as the Estella Pact, the plan foresees cross-party
negotiations on the status of the Basque region running parallel
with disarmament talks between the government and ETA.
	   But the Estella Pact was slammed by Carlos Iturgaiz, the only
other candidate for lehendakari, as an ``imposition'' of
pro-independence parties. Iturgaiz heads the Basque branch of
Aznar's Popular Party that rejects any change in the status of the
Basque region.
	   The candidate also said that the treat of violence remained and
needed to be ``combated'', despite ETA's truce.
	   Popular Party politicians were ETA's favored targets in the
months prior to the cease-fire, and Iturgaiz has been consistently
suspicious of the slow move towards possible peace negotiations
since the group's cease-fire.
	   ETA has killed nearly 800 people since beginning its violent
campaign for an independent Basque homeland straddling parts of
northern Spain and southern France in 1968.

Chelsea and United tie 0-0
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Tore Andre Flo and Gianfranco Zola missed four
good chances as Chelsea squandered a chance to regain top place in
the Premier League from Aston Villa on Tuesday after a 0-0 tie with
Manchester United.
	   Flo had three opportunities in the first half while the
ever-dangerous Zola had two. The experienced Italian got round
United goalkeeper Peter Schmeichel only to roll the ball wide nine
minutes from the end.
	   The goal-less tie means that Chelsea remains second, two points
behind Villa after 20 of the 38 games in the campaign and United is
fourth.
	   In another Premier League game, Leeds and Wimbledon tied 2-2.
	   Flo headed Zola's corner wide and then shot wide of the near
post from five meters as Chelsea, who tied 1-1 at Old Trafford 12
days ago, created the early chances at Stamford Bridge.
	   In the 21st minute, Zola dribbled skilfully past United's Dutch
defender Jaap Stam only for Schmeichel to save his well-struck shot
with a brilliant one-handed stop. The ball rolled to Flo who
stabbed it wide with the 'keeper grounded.
	   Zola should have scored just before half time when he
intercepted a poor pass from Roy Keane but Schmeichel raced off his
line to grab the ball at his feet.
	   For United, Andy Cole wasted a chance when he hesitated in front
of goal and Keane fired too high from 20 meters early in the second
half. Although Alex Ferguson's team had more of the play after the
break, it failed to create any clear cut openings.
	   At Elland Road, Leeds twice took the lead against the Dons who
hit back with two equalizer.
	   After Bruno Ribeiro had fired David O'Leary's team ahead, Robbie
Earle leveled and, after David Hopkin has restored Leeds'
advantage, Karl Cort replied to earn Roy Kinnear's team a point.

<TEXT>
	   NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) _ President Glafcos Clerides said Tuesday
that he was canceling plans to deploy controversial, Russian-made
missiles in this island nation.
	   His decision was announced in a statement issued at the end of a
meeting of the policy-making Greek Cypriot National Council, which
is composed of political party leaders.
	   The move likely will reduce tensions with Turkey _ which had
threatened to block the missiles' deployment _ but will add to
Clerides' political troubles since he reversed his own pledge to
put the missiles in place.
	   Other Greek Cypriot leaders insist the S-300 anti-aircraft
missiles be deployed to counter Turkey's defense of the Turkish
Cypriot northern part of the divided island.
	   Participants at the meeting of party leaders said there were
intense disagreements and that, in the end, Clerides took
responsibility himself for canceling the deployment.
	   Clerides admitted ``that there was lack of unanimity'' at the
meeting.
	   He said he would now negotiate with the Russian government for
the deployment of the missiles on the Greek island of Crete.
	   The announcement in Nicosia followed Clerides' talks in the
Greek capital Athens earlier in the day with Greek Premier Costas
Simitis and Greece's defense and foreign ministers.
	   Simitis later issued a statement saying the Greek government
``fully supports'' Clerides' decision. He said the missile
deployment in Crete would still serve the defensive interests of
Greece and Cyprus.
	   In Ankara, Turkish Foreign Minister Ismail Cem called the Greek
Cypriot move a victory for Turkey's refusal to waiver.
	   ``The S-300 issue was a play badly schemed by Greece, badly
staged by the Greek Cypriots and one which has turned into a sad
comedy,'' he told Turkey's NTV television.

Dino Radja and Bodiroga lead East to Euro All-Star win
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: ADDS Quotes, byline, recasts in parts &QL; 
 &UR; By ROY KAMMERER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BERLIN (AP) _ Former Celtics player Dino Radja and Dejan
Bodiroga Tuesday hit key baskets down the stretch Tuesday as the
East beat the West in the European All-Star game.
	   It was Bodiroga, although he had several former NBA players as
teammates, who settled the 104-98 East win in a game played under
near NBA-like rules including a 24-second clock.
	   The Yugoslav forward, playing for Greece's Panathinaikos Athen,
scored 15 points for the East and rattled off six straight points
as the East trailed 93-91 with 3:20 left.
	   Like everyone else, Bodiroga was enthusiastic about the new
rules European basketball's governing body, FIBA, is thinking of
implementing.
	   ``They're great, it makes the game quicker. A player has a
chance to display all his abilities on court,'' said Bodiroga.
	   Radja, his teammate at the Athens club, led the East with 17
points and dunked twice with time running out to kill the West's
last hopes.
	   Carlton Myers of Italy's TeamSystem Bologna was the game MVP
after hitting for 20 points for the West and adding a little
razzle-dazzle to the match.
	   Former Miami Heat player Pedrag Danilovic, now suited up for
Italy's European champions Kinder Bologna, added 19.
	   For a while it appeared Myers and Danilovic, who had 16 of his
points in the second half, would break the West jinx. The East has
now won all three editions of the all-star contest.
	   Danilovic poured in nine points as the West went on an 18 to 10
spurt to start the second half that put them up 69-65.
	   Myers then took over by firing threes. The son of Italian and
English parents also added a little show biz to a match that lacked
sizzle when he found himself wide-open at the 3-point line in the
third quarter.
	   ``Knowing I won the 3-point contest at halftime, I asked the
crowd if they thought I was going to hit it or miss it,'' said
Myers, who sank the shot to the crowd's delight.
	   A disappointing crowd of 7,500 in the 9,000-seat Max Schmeling
Hall came hoping to see spectacular moves and often found the
European players playing hard-nose defense.
	   ``I think the European mentality is to play to win every game,''
said FIBA spokesman Florian Wanninger. ``The NBA players are
willing not to play defense for a couple of quarters to put on a
show.''
	   The German crowd wanted to see dunks, exploding every time a
player put on a little show of power.
	   But Conrad McRae of Fenerbahnce Istanbul drew the biggest roard
when he missed a power dunk that shook the rim.
	   The shot would have given the East a 82-81 lead with eight
minutes left.
	   The small crowd, after sellouts the previous two years at Tel
Aviv and Instanbul, proved FIBA still has a ways to go in selling a
European All-Star game.
	   ``It wasn't a sell-out but I though it was a pretty good show. I
had fun anyhow,'' said Myers.
	   FIBA also couldn't find a major German TV station to televise
the game live even though the contest was played in the country.
	   The new rules also included playing quarters instead of halves
and forcing teams to move the ball out of the backcourt in eight
seconds instead of 10.

Dino Radja and Bodiroga lead East to Euro All-Star win

<TEXT>
	   BERLIN (AP) _ Former Celtics player Dino Radja and Dejan
Bodiroga Tuesday hit key baskets down the stretch Tuesday as the
East beat the West in the European All-Star game.
	   It was Bodiroga, although he had several former NBA players as
teammates, who settled the 104-98 East win in a game played under
near NBA-like rules including a 24-second clock.
	   The Yugoslav forward, playing for Greece's Panathinaikos Athen,
scored 15 points for the East and rattled off six straight points
as the East trailed 93-91 with 3:20 left.
	   Like everyone else, Bodiroga was enthusiastic about the new
rules European basketball's governing body, FIBA, is thinking of
implementing.
	   ``They're great, it makes the game quicker. A player has a
chance to display all his abilities on court,'' said Bodiroga.
	   Radja, his teammate at the Athens club, led the East with 17
points and dunked twice with time running out to kill the West's
last hopes.
	   Carlton Myers of Italy's TeamSystem Bologna was the game MVP
after hitting for 20 points for the West and adding a little
razzle-dazzle to the match.
	   Former Miami Heat player Pedrag Danilovic, now suited up for
Italy's European champions Kinder Bologna, added 19.
	   For a while it appeared Myers and Danilovic, who had 16 of his
points in the second half, would break the West jinx. The East has
now won all three editions of the all-star contest.
	   Danilovic poured in nine points as the West went on an 18 to 10
spurt to start the second half that put them up 69-65.
	   Myers then took over by firing threes. The son of Italian and
English parents also added a little show biz to a match that lacked
sizzle when he found himself wide-open at the 3-point line in the
third quarter.
	   ``Knowing I won the 3-point contest at halftime, I asked the
crowd if they thought I was going to hit it or miss it,'' said
Myers, who sank the shot to the crowd's delight.
	   A disappointing crowd of 7,500 in the 9,000-seat Max Schmeling
Hall came hoping to see spectacular moves and often found the
European players playing hard-nose defense.
	   ``I think the European mentality is to play to win every game,''
said FIBA spokesman Florian Wanninger. ``The NBA players are

<TEXT>
	   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) _ As peace talks approached, leftist
rebels attacked a police post and battled with right-wing
paramilitary fighters, authorities said Tuesday.
	   The fighting was taking place a week before negotiations between
the guerrillas and President Andres Pastrana, who is hoping to end
the 34-year conflict. The talks set for Jan. 7 are going forward
without a cease-fire.
	   Police said one officer was killed and three others were wounded
when rebels from the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or
FARC, overran a garrison in Nutibara, a village 190 miles (310
kilometers) northwest of Bogota in Antioquia state.
	   Nine officers were missing in the overnight assault, in which
rebels also blew up an electrical power station, burned down
civilian homes and downed a bridge, police said.
	   The men may have been kidnapped by the rebels, who previously
held about 350 police and soldiers seized in attacks during the
past two years
	   In separate fighting, clashes were also reported Tuesday between
the FARC and paramilitary groups in northern Cordoba state, a
stronghold of right-wing militias.
	   Army leaders discounted rumors that Carlos Castano_ the fugitive
chief of the United Autodefense Forces of Colombia _ was killed
during the combat in Murrucucu, a town 255 miles (410 kilometers)
northwest of Bogota.
	   Report's of Castano's death ``have no basis in reality at this
moment,'' armed services chief Gen. Fernando Tapias told a news
conference. Tapias said troops had not yet reached the scene of the
reported fighting.
	   The rumors swept the local media Tuesday after a well-known
militia confidant said in a radio interview that Castano had
``disappeared'' after guerrillas overran a fortified paramilitary
base.

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The Security Council urged the Angolan
government and UNITA rebels on Tuesday to immediately grant U.N.
forces access to the site of a downed U.N.-chartered plane to
determine the fate of the 14 people on board.
	   ``Any further delay jeopardizes the lives of possible
survivors,'' the council said in a statement to the press read by
the president, Jassim Mohammed Buallay of Bahrain.
	   The C-130 transport plane, chartered by the U.N. Observer
Mission in Angola, crashed Saturday 10 minutes after takeoff in the
bush near the central highland city of Huambo, about 500 kilometers
(310 miles) southeast of the Angolan capital Luanda.
	   On board were four crew members and 10 passengers, eight of whom
were with the U.N. force while the other two were under contract
with a company that works with the United Nations.
	   The United Nations immediately asked that the government and
UNITA grant safe passage for a search and rescue team but hasn't
received a positive response from either side, officials said
Tuesday.
	   The area is the site of renewed fighting between the government
and UNITA that has shattered the 1994 U.N.-brokered peace accord
that sought to end two decades of civil war in the former
Portuguese colony.
	   U.N. officials said Tuesday the plane's owner, TransAfric, flew
another plane high over the site and saw that it was seemingly
intact. But a U.N. spokesman in Luanda, Hamadoun Toure, said there
was only a ``very, very minor chance'' of survivors being found.
	   The council was particularly concerned that neither side had
taken effective action after the disappearance of three other
planes over UNITA territory, Buallay said. He did not elaborate on
the incidents.
	   But the Civil Aviation Authority said Tuesday a private cargo
plane disappeared over the weekend while en route from the capital
to the northeast town of Lukapa. There was no sign of the aircraft,
officials said.
	   A government plane was also shot down Dec. 14, but the military
hasn't said who was responsible.
	   ``Council members renew their appeal to the government of Angola
and UNITA to guarantee the safety and freedom of movement of MONUA
personnel and encourage the secretary-general to take additional
steps to ensure adequate security and protection for its
personnel,'' Buallay said.
	   The United Nations identified the 14 passengers and crew
Tuesday:
	   Jose Data and Dala Antonio, both of Angola and both contract
employees of Dinacom, which works with the United Nations. Members
of the U.N. team include Rui Cameling of Angola, Assa Salaam Galal
of Egypt, Wilfried Mateka of Cameroon, Margaret Zulu of Zambia, Lt.
Paulus Willem of Namibia, Patrick Luckman of Australia, Oleg
Kapturovic and Savin S. of Russia. The crew include Capt. John
Wilkinson of South Africa, Carlos Alberto Constantino Tavares Da
Silba of Angola, Carlos Melgar of Bolivia and Benjamin Montefalcon
of the Philippines.

Four Westerners killed in bloody end to Yemen kidnapping

	   SAN`A, Yemen (AP) _ Yemeni troops exchanged gunfire with Islamic
extremists holding 16 Western tourists hostage Tuesday, ending the
kidnapping that left four hostages dead.
	   An American women and a British woman were hospitalized with
injuries.
	   Yemen's Interior Ministry said the kidnappers had killed three
of the captives and that a fourth, who was wounded in the incident,
died later in hospital.
	   It was not immediately clear if the fourth victim, a British
man, had been harmed by the kidnappers or wounded in the shootout
between the Islamic extremists and about 200 Yemen security forces.
	   The Interior Ministry said all of the dead were British. But in
London, British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook said the dead included
an Australian.
	   Three of the kidnappers, including an Egyptian, were killed, the
Interior Ministry said.
	   The 16 tourists _ 12 Britons, two Americans and two Australians
_ were kidnapped Monday near the southern town of Mawdiyah, about
175 miles south of the capital, San`a.
	   Their convoy of five vehicles was ambushed by men who opened
fire on their police escorts. The kidnappers threatened to kill the
tourists if the police did not back off, Yemen security officials
said.
	   Tribesmen in unruly Yemen have frequently kidnapped tourists to
pressure the government into providing them with new roads, water
or clinics. But the hostages generally have been treated as guests
and released unharmed.
	   Four Germans are being held by a tribe in northeast Yemen. The
kidnappers are demanding more schools, hospitals and telephone
lines in their area.
	   The latest incident marked the first time an abduction was
carried out by Islamic extremists. Security officials said the
kidnappers belong to Islamic Jihad, many of whose leaders fought
Russian troops in Afghanistan. The group is believed to have about
200 members.
	   The Interior Ministry statement said members of the ``extremist
terrorist gang'' killed three of the captives _ two men and a
woman.
	   ``They proceeded in killing the captives after refusing any
attempts at negotiations, which led security forces to storm the
area to prevent further bloodshed and ensure the safe release of
the rest of the hostages,'' the statement said.
	   The bodies of the dead and injured tourists were ferried by
government helicopter to a hospital in the southern port city of
Aden, security officials said. The other tourists were escorted by
troops to a hotel in Aden.
	   After the shootout, security forces detained scores of suspected
Islamic extremists, said the officials, who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
	   The kidnappers had demanded the release of their leader, Saleh
Haidara al-Atwi, who was detained two weeks ago as part of a
government crackdown on Islamic vigilantes who had been enforcing
strict Islamic rules in southern Yemen, security officials said.
	   Islamic Jihad members reportedly were flogging women who did not
observe the Islamic dress code and men for selling and drinking
alcohol, which is forbidden in Islam.
	   The kidnappers also wanted the release of another leader, the
officials said. They did not identify him.
	   The group ran a military camp in southern Yemen, security
officials said.
	   Yemen was once a haven for Islamic militant fugitives from other
countries, but the government has expelled many of them.
	   Before the shootout, Yemeni officials tried to negotiate with
the kidnappers while security forces encircled the area.
	   Ahmad Ali Mohsen, governor of Abyan province, where the
kidnapping took place, was leading the talks with leaders of the
Al-Fadl tribe, to which the kidnappers belong, an official at the
governor's office said.
	   A London-based Islamic human rights group said Tuesday that it
had contacted the kidnappers the night before and received
assurances that they would not harm the hostages.
	   ``They promised not to harm the hostages,'' said a spokesman for
the Islamic Observation Center. ``We hold the Yemeni government
responsible for the deaths. The way the authorities handled the
situation was barbaric and irresponsible.''

FIS president defends anti-doping system in skiing
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BORMIO, Italy (AP) _ Rejecting suggestions of careless drug
testing in skiing, FIS president GianFranco Kasper said Tuesday
that regular urine tests were carried out at World Cup races in
France and Italy over the last month.
	   Kasper conceded however that blood tests, urged by some athletes
in the frame of a stricter anti-doping campaign in Alpine skiing,
have not been enforced because they are not reliable enough at the
moment.
	   ``Our experts believe that at the moment blood tests are not
reliable enough in Alpine skiing,'' the president of the
International Ski Federation said.
	   Blood tests have been instead carried out in cross-country
skiing ``where they can help detect EPO in an endurance sport.''
	   Italian ski star Deborah Compagnoni, a three-time Olympic and
world champion, had lamented on Monday that anti-doping tests were
seldom carried out in Alpine skiing and that combined urine-blood
tests were necessary to dispel suspects of doping use in the sport.
	   Kasper said FIS was ready to enforce blood and even hair tests
if the International Olympic Committee (IOC) congress on doping,
scheduled in Lausanne in February, ``brings new and reliable
anti-doping controls.''

FIS president defends anti-doping system in skiing
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BORMIO, Italy (AP) _ Countering suggestions of careless drug
testing in the sport of skiing, FIS president GianFranco Kasper
said Tuesday that regular urine tests were carried out at World Cup
races in France and Italy over the last month.
	   Kasper conceded however that blood tests, urged by some athletes
in the frame of a stricter anti-doping campaign in Alpine skiing,
have not been enforced because they are not reliable enough at the
moment.
	   Blood tests have instead been carried out in cross-country
skiing ``where they can help detect EPO in an endurance sport,''
Kasper said.
	   Italian ski star Deborah Compagnoni, a three-time Olympic and
world champion, had lamented on Monday that anti-doping tests were
seldom carried out in Alpine skiing and that combined urine-blood
tests were necessary to dispel suspicions of drug use in the sport.
	   Kasper said FIS was ready to enforce blood and even hair tests
if the International Olympic Committee (IOC) congress on doping,
scheduled in Lausanne in February, ``brings new and reliable
anti-doping controls.''

	   LONDON (AP) _ Tore Andre Flo and Gianfranco Zola missed four
good chances as Chelsea squandered a chance to regain top place in
the Premier League from Aston Villa on Tuesday after a 0-0 tie with
Manchester United.
	   Flo had three opportunities in the first half while the
ever-dangerous Zola had two. The experienced Italian got round
United goalkeeper Peter Schmeichel only to roll the ball wide nine
minutes from the end.
	   The goal-less tie means that Chelsea remains second, two points
behind Villa after 20 of the 38 games in the campaign and United
moved up to third above Arsenal on goal difference.

Two U.S. servicemen arrested on suspicion of attempted murder

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japanese police have arrested two U.S. Air Force
servicemen stationed near Tokyo on suspicion of attempting to kill
a 39-year-old Japanese by hitting him with a car, a police
spokesman said Tuesday.
	   Takeyasu Kasai, spokesman of Tokyo's Fussa Police, identified
the two arrested as Senior Airman Anthony Udy, 25, and Airman
Arthur Tuttle, 21 _ both assigned to Yokota Air Base in western
Tokyo.
	   Hometowns for the two were not immediately known, Kasai said.
	   Police allege both men hit Yasutoshi Ishizuka in the face while
walking on a street near the base early Monday morning. When
Ishizuka called police on a portable phone, a car driven by Udy hit
him from behind, Kasai said.
	   Ishizuka suffered a broken left leg, and his injuries will
require two months of treatment, Kasai said.
	   Police later found the two airmen were drunk at the time and on
their way to the base after drinking, the spokesman said. Police
are investigating what led to the two airmen's alleged initial
attack on Ishizuka.
	   Maj. Stephen Clutter, spokesman for Yokota Air Base, said the
base will express regret over the incident and cooperate fully with
the Japanese police investigation.
	   There are 47,000 U.S. military service people stationed in Japan
under a mutual security treaty.

wounded in the incident, died later in a hospital. In London,
British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook said the dead included three
British hostages and an Australian. The U.S. State Department later
said an American was wounded. (YEMEN-KIDNAPPING)
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ A defiant Iraq said Tuesday that its
aircraft are flying in the no-fly zones patrolled by U.S. and
British warplanes and its anti-aircraft batteries remain ready to
fire on allied planes. The statement comes only a day after U.S.
warplanes opened fire on an Iraqi anti-aircraft position in the
northern no-fly zone, killing four Iraqi soldiers. Washington said
the planes attacked after Iraq shot missiles at the aircraft.
Iraq's latest move appears to be aimed at building support among
Arabs who angrily protested mid-December's U.S.-British airstrikes
_ but whose governments did little to back Iraq's demands for
lifting eight-year-old U.N. sanctions on the country. Vice
President Taha Yassin Ramadan voiced Iraq's latest defiance when
asked in an interview with Associated Press Television News if Iraq
was flying aircraft in the no-fly zones. ``We are doing it right
now,'' he replied. (IRAQ)
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Saying they were ``very sorry,'' but
refusing to accept responsibility, two top Khmer Rouge leaders
asked Cambodians to ``let bygones be bygones'' Tuesday and forget
about the genocide of the 1970s. Khieu Samphan and Nuon Chea were
flown by helicopter from a former rebel stronghold to the capital
to defect _ in effect, surrender _ to Prime Minister Hun Sen after
he pledged they would not face trial for crimes against humanity.
At a news conference, they were asked by journalists _ many of them
Cambodians who lost family members _ if they felt any remorse for
causing the deaths of as many as 2 million of their countrymen out
of a population of about 9 million. ``Yes, sorry, very sorry,''
Khieu Samphan said, looking red and sullen. (CAMBODIA-KHMER ROUGE)
	   FREETOWN, Sierra Leone (AP) _ A top rebel commander on Tuesday
said his forces would begin attacking Sierra Leone's capital within
two days if the government fails to agree to immediate talks to be
mediated by the Organization of African Unity. ``This is our
ultimatum,'' rebel leader Sam Bockarie said in a telephone
interview from his hideout in the countryside. ``If a dialogue is
not started we will have to invade Freetown. They have 48 hours.''
The renewed threat comes after Sierra Leone's defense force
retreated from the key central town of Makeni and were redeploying
to defend the capital. The rebel Revolutionary United Front along
with allies from Sierra Leone's disbanded military are demanding
President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah's resignation and have rejected an
offer of amnesty in return for their weapons. (SIERRA LEONE)
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ After the worst outbreak of fighting
in months, more international monitors were sent Tuesday to Kosovo
to shore up the fragile truce between government forces and ethnic
Albanian rebels. Meanwhile, NATO repeated warnings it stands ready
to intervene if the two sides fail to respect the Oct. 12 agreement
between Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic and U.S. envoy
Richard Holbrooke, which ended seven months of fighting and averted
NATO airstrikes. That agreement was severely strained by four days
of fighting between government forces and the ethnic Albanian
Kosovo Liberation Army, which erupted Christmas Eve and left at
least 15 people dead. Kosovo, a province of Yugoslavia's main
republic Serbia, was generally quiet Tuesday. (YUGOSLAVIA-KOSOVO)

	   A summary of financial and business news from The Associated
Press at 0000 GMT. Stories carry ``f'' or ``i'' category codes and
move on this circuit in expanded form:
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ The Dow industrials rose within 55 points of a
new record Tuesday, advancing for an eighth straight session for
its longest winning streak in two years. The Standard and Poor's
500 index and the Nasdaq composite reached new highs again despite
some profit-taking among leading Internet stocks. The Dow Jones
industrial average erased an early 39-point loss and rose 94.23
points _ or by 1 percent _ to 9,320.98, closing fast on the Nov. 23
record of 9,374.27. (US-CLOSING STOCKS)
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia produced an estimated 303.5 million metric
tons of oil in 1998, and exported 134 million metric tons, the Fuel
and Energy Ministry said Tuesday. Oil exports are Russia's main
revenue earner, and the cash-strapped government has been trying to
keep up exports, despite the slide of world oil prices. This year's
exports will mark a 6.3-percent increase from 1997, the Fuel and
Energy Ministry said, according to the Interfax news agency. But
revenues were down considerably, officials have said. Next year,
Russia is expected to produce between 284 million metric tons and
296 million metric tons of oil _ down nearly 5 percent from 1998,
the ministry said. (RUSSIA-OIL)
	   KUWAIT (AP) _ Kuwait's northern oil fields could be developed
and operated by interested foreign companies for about dlrs 7
billion in five years, the oil minister said in remarks published
Tuesday. The minister, Sheik Saud al-Sabah, told local newspaper
editors on Monday that the operation agreements Kuwait was seeking
with American and British companies would double production from
these fields to more than 900,000 barrels a day. No contracts or
memorandums of understanding have yet been signed with any
companies, the minister said. But the firms approached by Kuwait
have reacted positively and they believe Kuwait's proposal is
``unique,'' he added. (KUWAIT-OIL)
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia attracted dlrs 2 billion in foreign direct
investment in 1998, only about half what was invested the year
before, a news agency reported Tuesday, citing an Economics
Ministry official. The relatively paltry foreign capital inflows,
given the country's size, reflected investors' concerns over the
Russian economy, heightened by the recent financial crisis and the
ruble's collapse, Vladimir Yefimov said. ``Unfortunately, this is a
very small volume given the state of our industry,'' Yefimov told
the ITAR-Tass news agency. Direct foreign investment in Russia
reached dlrs 3.9 billion in 1997 before collapsing this year.
Yefimov predicted that direct investment _ that is, investment
directly in companies, as opposed to stocks or other financial
instruments _ would reach dlrs 2.5 billion in 1999. (RUSSIA-FOREIGN
INVESTMENT)
	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ Sweden's decision not to adopt the euro
on Jan. 1, when 11 other European Union countries do, denies
significant cost savings to carmaker AB Volvo, a company official
said Tuesday. ``Our main competitors are in the euro zone, and if
Sweden would have joined the single currency, our costs would have
been several hundred millions of kronor less,'' said Lars Persson,
in charge of Volvo's euro strategy. That's tens of millions of
dollars. Volvo plans to adopt the euro as a group currency from
Jan. 1, 2001. Projected benefits should start earlier. As currency
exchange operations in the 11 other countries _ including Germany,
France and Italy _ tend to disappear, price comparisons will be
more transparent. (SWEDEN-VOLVO)

 &UR; Eds: Contains items on Matthias Hoffmann, Arthur Kostler, a
religious ruling on the use of computers, Jim Caviezel, Gerhard
Schroeder and Steven Spielberg . &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MANNHEIM, Germany (AP) _ Both sides filed appeals Tuesday in the
tax evasion conviction of Matthias Hoffmann, a former concert
promoter who helped organize the Three Tenors events.
	   Hoffmann, 47, was convicted last week of evading dlrs 9 million
in taxes and was sentenced to five years and eight months in
prison.
	   Prosecutors had sought a sentence of seven years, while the
defense had asked for less than five.
	   Appeals were filed with the Federal Court of Justice in
Karlsruhe, but both sides declined to comment.
	   The tenors _ Luciano Pavarotti, Jose Carreras, Placido Domingo _
and soprano Montserrat Caballe were named as suspects last month
for allegedly helping Hoffmann evade taxes. They are still under
investigation.
	   ___
	   EDINBURGH, Scotland (AP) _ A bronze bust of the late writer
Arthur Koestler, alleged in a recent biography to have been a
serial rapist, was removed Tuesday from a foyer in Edinburgh
University.
	   The university said the move was due to fears of vandalism.
	   ``The university decided, as a temporary precaution, to remove
the bust from the Department of Psychology's main entrance hall
into another part of the department, in case anyone decided to take
action against the bust,'' a spokeswoman for the university said.
	   Koestler, who died in 1983 at age 77 in a suicide pact with his
wife, was described this year in David Cesarani's biography, ``The
Homeless Mind,'' as being a heavy drinker who was routinely violent
toward women.
	   British newspapers reported Tuesday that some female students
were uncomfortable with the statue. However, the university said it
had received no complaints directly from students.
	   Koestler was a former Communist whose best-known novel
``Darkness at Noon'' was an indictment of Stalinist terror. He was
held as a prisoner under Gen. Francisco Franco during the Spanish
Civil War while working as a journalist, and settled in England in
1940.
	   He left dlrs 800,000 in his will to set up a chair of
parapsychology at a British university to investigate the
paranormal after his death. The bequest was awarded to Edinburgh
University, which erected the bust in his honor.
	   ___
	   BNEI BRAK, Israel (AP) _ A leading Orthodox rabbi has ruled that
the word ``God'' may be erased from a computer screen or disk,
because the pixels do not constitute real letters.
	   According to Jewish law, printed matter with the word _
``elohim'' in Hebrew, and its manifestations in any other language
_ must be stored or ritually buried.
	   Rabbi Moshe Shaul Klein published his ruling this week in a
computer magazine aimed at Orthodox Jews, ``Mahsheva Tova.'' Klein
was responding to a question from a reader who was anxious about
whether the ban on erasing the variations on the word ``God''
applied to computers.
	   The rabbi, prominent in ultra-Orthodox circles in this Tel Aviv
suburb, ruled that the letters may be erased.
	   ``The letters on a computer screen are an assemblage of pixels,
dots of light, what have you,'' the rabbi's assistant, Yossef Hayad
explained Tuesday.
	   ``Even when you save it to disk, it's not like you're throwing
anything more than a sequence of ones and zeroes away,'' Hayad
said.
	   The existence of the magazine _ a pun that suggests both ``Good
Computing'' and ``Worthy Thinking'' _ reflects the growing
incursion of modern implements into the world of the
ultra-Orthodox.
	    &UR; ___ &QC; 
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Jim Caviezel knows what it's like to consider
giving up.
	   After nearly seven years of frustration and bit parts, the
30-year-old actor was contemplating moving with his schoolteacher
wife, Kerry, back to his native Washington state and studying
chiropractic medicine when he won a lead role in Terrence Malick's
``The Thin Red Line,'' a World War II film which opened last week.
	   ``I was almost out the door,'' Caviezel said in Tuesday's Daily
News.
	   Shortly before that, Caviezel had been up for a role in ``The
Hi-Lo Country,'' a Western directed by Stephen Frears. That part
eventually went to Billy Crudup.
	   ``I had been close before, but I thought maybe I had a shot with
this,'' he said. ``He took the wind out of me.''
	   But the wind was restored when he got Malick's call about ``The
Thin Red Line.''
	   ``It's like winning the lottery,'' he said. ``Everything from
this point on is just cake.''
	   ___
	   HAMBURG, Germany (AP) _ Talk about The Real World.
	   German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder's first New Year's address
to the nation will be carried first on the music channel MTV.
	   MTV _ the channel that has brought viewers ``The Real World,''
``Singled Out'' and ``FANatic'' _ announced Monday that it will air
the taped address during an afternoon New Year's Eve special.
Germany's public stations traditionally broadcast the chancellor's
New Year's speech after their evening news programs.
	   MTV said the decision to run Schroeder's address was a reaction
to the positive response it got to its German election night
coverage in September.
	   MTV also plans to repeat the address in the evening, during its
``Dancefloor Mix'' show.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   UNIVERSAL CITY, California (AP) _ E.T. tugged on viewers'
heartstrings in the movie ``E.T.: The Extra-Terrestrial.'' In 1999,
he'll be tugging on your seat belt.
	   The lovable alien with the glowing index finger will be a safety
ambassador in a ``Buckle-Up-America'' public service TV ad
campaign, organizers said Monday.
	   ``E.T. holds a special place in so many hearts,'' Steven
Spielberg, who directed the cute critter in his 1982 debut, said
Monday.
	   ``I'm extremely pleased that the values symbolized by E.T. will
be used to aid and address the issues of safe driving.''

	   CONAKRY, Guinea (AP) _ The prison cells are empty now, the roof
torn off for scrap, the doors ripped away. Shaded by leafy trees
and walled off from the noise of this ramshackle capital, the
abandoned compound is simply a tranquil spot.
	   Look closely, though, at walls covered with mold and crawling
with spiders: Row after row of hash marks have been scratched into
the concrete, dates and words have been laboriously carved.
	   Here, in a prison camp that was once among the most feared
places in West Africa, the lives of thousands of people tortured
and killed during the brutal 26-year regime of former President
Sekou Toure have been reduced to the scrawl of some fading
graffiti.
	   ``Arrete,'' one man carved, in French, into the wall of his Camp
Boiro cell, and the date of his arrest: Sept. 10, 1977. His name,
though, and the rest of his message can't be deciphered. They've
been lost to the rain and the sun and the mold.
	   That, say people campaigning to have the victims of Toure's
regime remembered, is precisely what the current government wants.
	   Historical memory is often a battleground. From Japanese
textbook entries about World War II to American portrayals of 19th
century Indian wars, many countries furiously debate their violent
histories.
	   In Africa, nations from Nigeria to South Africa are arguing over
government-sponsored brutalities of recent decades.
	   But in Guinea, some people say the question has become whether
there should be memories of any sort about Toure's regime.
	   ``There is a conspiracy to just close the issue and not talk
about it,'' said Ousmane Diop, a statistician who spent a year at
Camp Boiro in the early 1970s and has become an activist for the
victims' cause.
	   President Lansana Conte, who seized power in a coup days after
Toure died in 1984 and won his second election in mid-December, has
created a milder regime than his predecessor's dictatorship,
critics say, but he still remains firmly at the center of power.
And there are few things he wants less than to resurrect memories
of Toure's terror.
	   ``They just want to forget it,'' Diop said.
	   Critics say the government is trying to stifle the memories by
allowing construction atop a cemetery where prisoners were buried
and by refusing to release an accounting of Toure's brutal purges.
The government also has rejected calls to build a monument at Camp
Boiro.
	   Meanwhile, Toure's former party has been trying to rehabilitate
itself, playing down _ or simply denying _ his atrocities.
	   The Camp Boiro prison, a 76-cell compound inside a military
base, was the most feared symbol of Toure's government, a one-party
Marxist regime that began with the promise of socialist brotherhood
but quickly descended into state-encouraged suspicion, imagined
plots and mass arrests.
	   Thousands of Guineans _ along with French, Lebanese and other
foreigners _ were sent to die at Camp Boiro, victims of Toure's
paranoia.
	   Prisoners were beaten, shocked with electrodes and starved until
they confessed to whatever they were accused of. Inmates were
locked away during daylight hours and allowed no contact with the
outside. Anyone who resisted was sealed into a cell with no food or
water, an agonizing death known as the ``black diet.''
	   ``If you are clever, you (confess) immediately and write down
whatever they want,'' said Abdoulaye Diallo, a soft-spoken lawyer
who spent nearly 10 years in the prison and still bumps into his
torturers in the streets of Conakry. ``For two and a half years, I
never saw the sun _ never.''
	   The camp was just one part of Toure's terror.
	   ``Everyone was afraid,'' said Boubacar Baidy Gueye, a
businessman who fled Guinea as a child after his father was
arrested. ``Husbands were afraid of wives. Parents were afraid of
children. Children were afraid of their brothers and sisters.''
	   No one is sure how many people died in the purges _ estimates
range from 6,000 to 35,000 _ but by Toure's death some 2 million
people had fled the country.
	   Gueye, whose fury over his father's death still tears at him, is
raising money for a memorial to the dictator's victims.
	   ``People need to know about this,'' he insisted bitterly.
	   But instead, Toure's reign of terror has become a largely
forgotten horror in a largely ignored country.
	   One of the world's poorest nations, Guinea achieved independence
in 1958 and immediately began its long decline. The French, furious
that Guinea was leaving their sphere of influence, destroyed nearly
all they had built during colonial rule _ everything from power
lines to toilets.
	   Toure, the first president, then sowed terror with ethnic and
political witch hunts while he crippled the economy with
nationalizations and mismanagement.
	   Fourteen years after his death, Guinea still faces rampant
poverty and nearly four of every five people can't read or write.
	   But the country is rebuilding. New buildings have gone up in
recent years and scattered construction projects are in progress.
	   The political situation has also softened. Purges have ended,
newspapers openly criticize the government, and a multiparty
presidential election was held Dec. 14. Opposition groups claimed
Conte's latest victory was rigged, but monitors from the U.S.
Embassy said the voting process appeared much cleaner than when
Conte won in 1993.
	   Conte's critics contend, though, that the political openness is
largely a facade. They note the president's re-election campaign
was backed with government funds, military support and control of
broadcast media.
	   Despite such accusations, though, the fear that suffused Conakry
during Toure's time, when secret police stalked every street, has
ended.
	   Government officials, who seldom mention the bloody purges of
Toure at all, declined requests to discuss the political situation
or the terror.
	   The victims, though, say the memories must survive.
	   ``It's important the young know what happened,'' said Aissatou
Poredaka Diallo, whose husband died at Camp Boiro. ``You have to
ask questions about what happened here, so you don't believe the
lies.''

Costa Rica lets villagers harvest eggs of endangered turtles

<TEXT>
	   OSTIONAL, Costa Rica (AP) _ Several times a year, thousands of
olive ridley turtles laboriously drag themselves up onto a pristine
Pacific beach to deposit their eggs.
	   Each time, hundreds of Costa Ricans follow in the endangered
creatures' tracks to scoop up the eggs.
	   The scene isn't altogether unusual in Central America, where the
poor get by any way they can. What's unusual is that it's legal,
despite a ban on hunting the turtles, which were near extinction
not long ago.
	   Authorities have given 300 members of a local cooperative
permission to gather eggs during the first three days of each wave
of egg-laying turtles. The turtles come ashore for up to a week
several times during the August-December season.
	   The turtle eggs are sold as delicacies to augment the villagers'
meager incomes.
	   If the villagers didn't collect the eggs, they would be trampled
by other turtles coming ashore to lay their eggs, officials say.
	   The harvest in Ostional, a national refuge 185 miles (300
kilometers) west of San Jose, the capital, is ``biologically
viable'' and helps the local community's economy, biologist Randall
Arauz says.
	   Every year more than 200,000 of the endangered turtles arrive at
the park, depositing millions of eggs. Only about 8 percent of the
eggs mature fully because most are destroyed by crawling turtles,
Arauz says.
	   To the north of Ostional, thousands of giant sea turtles land at
Las Baulas National Park between October and March.
	   The arrival of the large creatures _ which can be more than 2
meters (6 1-2 feet) long and weigh 500 kilos (1,100 pounds) _
attracts hundreds of tourists, who are guided onto the beach at
night to witness the egg-laying.
	   Turtle fans also flock to Costa Rica's Atlantic Coast to visit
the famed Tortuguero National Park, where four different species of
turtles lay their eggs. Although it is a turtle sanctuary, the
government grants 1,600 permits each year for hunters to kill
turtles.
	   The environmental group Caribbean Conservation estimates illegal
hunters kill an additional 8,000 turtles, which can fetch more than
dlrs 45 each.
	   Arauz accuses Costa Rican authorities of failing to enforce the
anti-hunting law and says they don't allocate enough money for
guarding against poaching.
	   ``We have to learn that turtles can generate more money alive
than dead, because of the tourists they attract,'' he says.

Former Khmer Rouge official teaches human rights to ex-rebels

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Mey Mann went off to Paris as a
young college student, and came back a leftist revolutionary.
	   But he later broke with his fellow founders of the Khmer Rouge
movement over the use of violence, and watched them go off into the
countryside to grow into a guerrilla army that became infamous for
its brutality.
	   Today, with the Khmer Rouge broken, Mey Mann is helping pick up
the pieces of his former colleagues' bloody legacy by teaching
Cambodians respect for basic human rights.
	   He says he does not know why the group's communist revolution
went terribly wrong _ why the charismatic young Saloth Sar he
studied with in Paris mutated into the ultra-radical Pol Pot who
led a regime that caused the deaths of as many as 2 million
Cambodians.
	   ``What I regret is that there was no good result from the
ideology we had at the beginning,'' says Mey Mann, now 77. ``Our
dream was for social justice, but what happened was not that.''
	   Pol Pot is now dead, the victim of an apparent heart attack in
April, and his once-fierce army has been reduced to a small band of
desperate guerrillas.
	   Mey Mann is working to rehabilitate the people the Khmer Rouge
left behind. Deeply involved in humanitarian work since 1979, he is
head of the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights office in
Pailin, a one-time rebel stronghold near the border with Thailand.
	   Opened in September, the office is training school teachers and
former Khmer Rouge commanders so they can in turn instruct
civilians and soldiers about human rights principles.
	   It sounds odd. The Khmer Rouge were some of history's greatest
violators of human rights. They won a civil war in 1975 and
attempted to turn Cambodia into an agrarian utopia by enslaving the
entire population in labor camps.
	   Disease, hunger and systematic execution caused the deaths of
one Cambodian in five before a Vietnamese invasion toppled the
Khmer Rouge regime in 1979. But loyalists fought on for years.
	   The movement took a fatal blow only when thousands of guerrillas
in Pailin and other bases started defecting to the government in
1996. The last Khmer Rouge holdouts laid down their weapons in
early December, ending more than 20 years of civil war.
	   Mey Mann says the challenge of integrating the former guerrillas
into mainstream society is, ironically, made somewhat easier by the
discipline they followed as warriors.
	   Yet it's clear human rights are a long way from taking hold in
an area where summary executions were the accepted form of
punishment a short time ago.
	   ``Human rights for this integrated zone is something new for
them,'' Mey Mann says. ``They would like to understand what human
rights are exactly, but it will take some time.''
	   David Hawk, chief of education for the U.N. human rights effort
in Cambodia, praises Mey Mann's efforts in Pailin and brushes aside
questions about his past.
	   ``He had an interest in human rights and human rights education
in the late 1980s and later did translations for our office,'' Hawk
says. ``He was well known among educated Cambodians as a teacher
from the old society. His student days in Paris in the 1950s _ that
was a long, long time ago.''
	   Mey Mann traveled to Paris in 1949 to attend college and soon
met fellow Cambodian students who would become the nucleus of the
Khmer Rouge death machine _ Pol Pot, Ieng Sary and Khieu Samphan.
	   They craved independence for their country _ which was won from
France in 1953 _ and were swept up by the ideals of socialist
revolution. They returned home and preached a Marxist gospel to
growing numbers of Cambodians disaffected with the rule of Prince
Norodom Sihanouk.
	   Mey Mann says he last saw Pol Pot in person in 1963, just before
the Khmer Rouge leader and many other communists fled repression in
Phnom Penh and joined militants in the countryside.
	   ``He had charisma. Everybody loved him at that time,'' Mey Mann
recalls. ``I wish he was still alive so the international community
could bring him to trial and understand how he was.''
	   Mey Mann says he did not agree with the shift in emphasis to
military struggle, so he stayed in the capital and was forced to
reduce his political activities.
	   He says that when the Khmer Rouge captured Phnom Penh in 1975
and emptied the city of its inhabitants, a guerrilla commander
first asked him to stay behind. But after checking with his
superiors, the commander sent Mey Mann off into the countryside to
toil in a labor camp.
	   Mey Mann was separated from his family and never saw his four
children again.

Yugoslavia seeks to have Kosovo rebels declared terrorists

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ While diplomats try to shore up the
shaky Kosovo truce, Yugoslavia is urging the United Nations to
declare the province's ethnic Albanian rebels as terrorists and
crack down on their support network abroad.
	   The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe said an
additional 100 international observers have begun arriving in
Kosovo to try to prevent a recurrence of last week's four days of
fighting which severely strained an Oct. 12 peace accord.
	   The fighting, which erupted Christmas Eve, claimed at least 15
lives and sent an estimated 5,000 civilians fleeing villages around
the northern Kosovo town of Podujevo.
	   Although international verifiers managed to arrange a truce,
tensions in the area remain high. OSCE sources, speaking on
condition of anonymity, said four bodies were found Tuesday, two in
Kosovska Mitrovica and two others near the southern town of
Prizren.
	   The Serb Media Center reported a fifth body _ a 55-year-old
ethnic Albanian man _ was found near the southwestern town of Pec.
	   William Walker, an American diplomat who heads the OSCE's peace
verification force, said the additional 100 observers will bring to
about 700 the number of Americans, Canadians, Europeans and others
who are trying to ease tensions between Serbs and ethnic Albanians.
	   OSCE officials said they expect to have the full compliment of
2,000 verifiers on the ground in the province next month. Kosovo is
a province of Serbia, Yugoslavia's main republic.
	   ``We have to do whatever we can to stop violence,'' Walker said
Tuesday. ``That's what we're here for.''
	   Although Walker and his teams managed to bring an end to last
week's fighting, tensions remain high between Serbs and ethnic
Albanian rebels, who are demanding independence for the majority
Albanian province.
	   The spokesman for the ethnic Albanian rebels, Adem Demaci, said
the guerrillas will respect the truce ``but we will defend
ourselves with all means if necessary.''
	   Yugoslavia's Serb-led government claims the ethnic Albanian
Kosovo Liberation Army is a terrorist organization, which receives
financial support from Albanian expatriate communities in
Switzerland, Germany and elsewhere in Western Europe.
	   On Tuesday, Yugoslav Foreign Minister Zivadin Jovanovic asked
the United Nations to include the KLA in its list of terrorist
groups, a move which would pave the way to freezing foreign funds
and cracking down on supporters abroad.
	   In a letter to U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan, Jovanovic
accused the KLA of exploiting the Oct. 12 truce negotiated by
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic and U.S. envoy Richard
Holbrooke, which ended seven months of fighting.
	   Since the October agreement, which averted the threat of NATO
airstrikes, Jovanovic said the rebels have carried out 470
``terrorist attacks,'' including the killing of ethnic Albanians
loyal to the government.
	   Jovanovic claimed the KLA has links with ``organized
international terrorism.'' He called for an ``explicit
condemnation'' of the KLA and the closing down KLA liaison offices
in Western Europe.

	   BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) _ Authorities on Tuesday arrested a
fugitive ex-naval officer accused of stealing babies during
Argentina's 1976-83 `dirty war' against political leftists and
dissidents.
	   Naval security officers took Jorge Eduardo Acosta into custody
at Marine headquarters, where he surfaced two weeks after a federal
judge issued an arrest warrant for him when he failed to make a
Dec. 15 court appearance.
	   Acosta was later handed over to police.
	   He is wanted in an investigation into charges of a systematic
plan existed during the military dictatorship for the illicit
adoption of more than 200 children born to political prisoners.
	   From 1976-78, Acosta headed up the Navy Mechanics School, a
military training facility later converted into a secret killing
center. Many of the children's parents disappeared from there.
	   Prosecutors say the children, now in their 20s, were given to
military officials to be raised after their parents were murdered.

	   GUATEMALA CITY (AP) _ Guatemalan President Alvaru Arzu on
Tuesday marked the second anniversary of the signing of peace
accords by unveiling a prominently located monument.
	   The monument, on a patio near the National Palace, consists of
two brown hands opened toward the sky. Vice President Luis Alberto
Flores began what Arzu said will be a daily event: placing a white
rose on the monument.
	   Guatemala's peace agreement between the government and leftist
guerrillas was signed Dec. 29, 1996 and ended 36 years of civil
war. The conflict left 200,000 people dead or missing.
	   The peace accord succeeded in ending the fighting and the
demobilized rebels have put down their arms. Yet critics charge
that progress has been slow in strengthening the judicial system
and increasing civilian control over the military.

	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ For President Ernesto Zedillo, the price of
democracy has become rather steep: about 2.8 billion dollars.
	   That's how much Zedillo would like to make taxpayers pay to
compensate for an unexpected revenue shortfall. But an
opposition-led congress won't let him, saying the government should
tighten its belt rather than the people's.
	   Time is running out for an agreement. Should congress fail to
approve a 1999 budget by Dec. 31, Mexico could face an
unprecedented crisis. No one knows for sure what would happen in
such a scenario, which is not foreseen by the Mexican Constitution.
	   ``The government has shown no sign of being willing to
compromise,'' said Adolfo Aguilar Zinser, an independent senator.
	   Zedillo's predecessors never had to compromise. Congressional
approval of presidential initiatives _ no matter how unpopular _
was a foregone conclusion in Mexico during the 68 years that the
ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party enjoyed a majority in
Congress.
	   That changed with last year's midterm elections when the party,
known as the PRI, lost control of Congress.

	   JAPALA, Mexico (AP) _ Mechanical failure was the likely cause
for the crash of a Mexican navy plane that killed four people, a
navy spokesman said Tuesday.
	   The plane that crashed and exploded Monday had been conducting
practice landings in the Veracruz commercial airport on the coast
of the Gulf of Mexico.
	   The pilot and three mechanics on board were killed in the crash.

	   MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) _ The death toll in an explosion at a
sugar processing plant has reached 10 and a doctor said Tuesday the
prospects for the sole survivor are dim.
	   Marco Antonio Mejia, 42, suffered burns on 95 percent of his
body in an explosion Saturday at the Ingenio San Antonio plant in
the northwestern province of Chinandega,
	   ``Only God's will and Marco Antonio Mejia's supernatural
resistance keep him alive,'' Dr. Larry Ubeda told reporters.
	   The explosion occurred when workers tried to fix a broken pump.
The 10 other victims died within 48 hours of the blast.

	   PARAMARIBO, Suriname (AP) _ Surinamese President Jules
Wijdenbosch will visit Cuba on Jan. 11, the government announced
Tuesday.
	   Wijdenbosch, whose South American country is the second-poorest
in the Western Hemisphere after Haiti, is facing increasing
pressure to resign and has been seeking support from other leaders
in the region.
	   Cuba, meanwhile, has courted Suriname as part of its push to
become a member of the 15-member Caribbean Community trade group.
	   Wijdenbosch's visit is to ``contribute to the aim of deepening
the relationship'' between the two countries, the government said.
	   Cuban President Fidel Castro has been invited to Suriname next
year, it said.

	   PORT-OF-SPAIN, Trinidad (AP) _ Antiguan fugitive Trevor Jacobs
suffocated while stowing away in the landing gear well of a BWIA
jetliner, coroners in Trinidad said Tuesday.
	   Pathologist Ramnath Chandu Lal of the Trinidad Forensic Science
Center said Trevor Jacobs, a 30-year-old former police officer,
died from lack of air at high altitude during the flight from
Antigua to Trinidad.
	   Jacobs' frozen body was found Dec. 22 by workers doing
maintenance on the Lockheed 1011 in a hangar at Trinidad's Piarco
International Airport. It apparently had frozen in temperatures
near -40 degrees Fahrenheit (-40 degrees Celsius) at the airplane's
cruising altitude.
	   The flight began in Toronto, and police believe Jacobs climbed
aboard the aircraft during a stopover in Antigua.
	   Jacobs was wanted by Antiguan authorities on charges of
kidnapping 60-year-old Donna Pietracupa on Oct. 7. Pietracupa was
later released unharmed.

	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ In a massive relocation operation,
authorities helped hundreds of families move out of a working-class
neighborhood in western Mexico City Tuesday.
	   Some 460 families that had to be relocated after their land was
bought by a company accepted compensation payments ranging from
dlrs 3,000 to dlrs 5,000, while another 40 families opposed being
relocated, said Jose Manuel Hernandez, spokesperson at the Alvaro
Obregon borough.
	   The company, Poniente Santa Fe, also provided moving trucks at
no charge to those families that were willing to relocate,
Hernandez said.
	   He said the families had lived for up to 8 years in the
Tlayacapa neighborhood on the city's outskirts.
	   ``They're throwing us out because we can't pay in dollars,''
said Ernesto Olvera, who opposed the relocation, as he attended a
small protest. Many real estate deals in Mexico are negotiated in
dollars to prevent against further devaluations of the peso.

McMillan and Cairns put NZ close to victory
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) _ Craig McMillan and Chris Cairns
hit unbeaten half centuries and shared a record stand as New
Zealand moved towards a second test victory over India at the Basin
Reserve Wednesday.
	   Resuming on 73 for four and needing a further 140 to overhaul
the 213-run target, the home side was 188 for five at lunch on the
last day.
	   Another 25 runs will give New Zealand 1-0 lead in the
three-match series. The first test was abandoned without a ball
bowled at Carisbrook, Dunedin.
	   While Cairns, 52, survived a few anxious moments against leg
spinner Anil Kumble, McMillan, calmly held the innings together
with a chanceless 63.
	   The pair came together four minutes into the day when medium
paceman Javagal Srinath trapped Paul Wiseman plumb in front to
reduce New Zealand to 74 for five.
	   McMillan hit five boundaries in his 110-ball innings while
Cairns was more forceful in hitting a six and seven boundaries off
86 balls.
	   Cairns' six off teenage off spinner Harbhajan Singh resulted in
a lost ball and play was held up for 10 minutes.
	   The stand, already worth 114, improved on the New Zealand record
for the sixth wicket between John Guy and Tony MacGibbon against
Pakistan in Hyderabad in the 1955-56 series.

World War I-era surgery gives hope to Sierra Leone's war amputees

<TEXT>
	   LAKKA TOWN, Sierra Leone (AP) _ Before rebel attackers shattered
Yanor Kanu's life by hacking off both of her hands with a dull
machete blade, her greatest pleasure was holding her grandchildren
in her arms.
	   Now she's learning to use crab-like pincers constructed by
surgeons so she can squeeze together the surgically separated bones
on each forearm to grip a spoon, a broom or a pen _ and even grasp
a small child's hand.
	   ``I can never be whole again, but at least I can do small jobs
and play with my little ones,'' Kanu said, gazing at her 5-year-old
granddaughter playing beside her.
	   In Sierra Leone, a country where thousands of defenseless
villagers have been mutilated in a brutal campaign by rebels
seeking revenge for their ouster from power earlier this year, Red
Cross doctors have resurrected an almost forgotten World War I-era
surgical operation to rehabilitate and give hope to the country's
growing ranks of amputees.
	   The operation, named the Krukenberg method after a German doctor
who pioneered the procedure, involves separating the two bones of
the forearm and covering each piece with skin grafted from other
parts of the body, often the leg.
	   Although the resulting pincers are more useful than old
fashioned hooks or even high-tech artificial hands, the relatively
simple operation is rarely performed anymore in the West because
the pincers are regarded as unsightly. And unless people have lost
both of their hands, they are often willing to make do with one
hand and a prosthetic limb.
	   However, for most people in this desperately poor West African
nation, where rebel fighters have amputated the arms and legs of
countless villagers, function comes before fashion.
	   Without the Krukenberg pincers, even something as simple as
going to the bathroom cannot be done alone by double amputees.
	   Kanu, who is in her 50s and has three children and five
grandchildren, says if not for the Swiss, British and German
doctors who performed her operation at Freetown's Netlands Hospital
earlier this year, she would not want to continue living.
	   She did not expect to live through her ordeal back in April when
rebels unexpectedly attacked her village of Batkanu in northern
Sierra Leone. Ten elderly people and five children were killed in
the attack, she said. Nine others, including herself, had their
hands amputated by the rebels. Only those swift enough to run away
escaped.
	   ``They placed my arms on a mortar and told me that I should tell
President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah to give me new hands,'' Kanu grimly
recounted. ``Then they began chopping. The knives were not sharp,
and it took so long. I thought I would die from the pain. But
somehow I made it, and someone took me to a hospital.''
	   Staying with her granddaughter at a makeshift rehabilitation
center set up by the Red Cross at an abandoned tourist resort on
the tropical beachfront of Lakka Town, outside the capital, she is
learning how to flex previously unused muscles to wash dishes,
write and sweep the floor. Rehabilitation takes several months.
	   She plans to go back to her village of Batkanu when the fighting
dies down. Recent rebel advances, however, threaten the capital,
and pro-government forces have been put on the defensive.
	   Since July, dozens of Krukenberg operations have been performed
by foreign Red Cross doctors who, in the beginning, had little to
guide them but old textbooks.
	   Although Krukenbergs are also performed in India and Sri Lanka,
nowhere is the need as great as in Sierra Leone.
	   Margaret Staff, an Australian nurse working at Netlands
Hospital, said hundreds or thousands of operations could be needed
around the country. The Red Cross is planning to teach the method
to Sierra Leonean doctors.
	   ``Without this operation, there is no possibility of
rehabilitation for many of these patients,'' Staff said.
	   And while at first those who have been given Krukenberg pincers
draw curious stares from strangers, people quickly grow accustomed
to them, Staff said.
	   Children and teen-agers who have had the operation are the
quickest to adapt. Two months after having operations on both his
arms, Musa Mansary, 18, can write, draw and do other intricate
tasks. He plans to learn how to use a computer and would like to
work for the Red Cross one day.
	   ``The Red Cross helped me, and so now I'd like to help other
people,'' he said.

Government releases AFP correspondent after 20 months in detention

 &UR; Eds: RECAPS pvs, ADDS CJP comment, new to some points &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ASMARA, Eritrea (AP) _ The government has released an Eritrean
journalist working for Agence France-Presse after 20 months in
detention without charge, an official said Tuesday.
	   The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said Ruth
Simon had been granted amnesty, but gave no further details.
	   Simon, 36, was at her home in Asmara, the capital of this Horn
of Africa nation. She and family members declined to comment.
	   Simon was arrested April 25, 1997, after reporting that
President Isaias Afwerki had told a meeting of the ruling party
that Eritrean rebels were fighting alongside Sudanese rebels in
neighboring Sudan.
	   Afwerki denied making the statement, and officials said the
meeting had been closed to the press.
	   The National Democratic Alliance, an umbrella organization of
groups opposed to Sudan's Islamic government, is based in Eritrea.
	   Simon was never charged with any crime.
	   In November, the correspondent for the French news service was
awarded in absentia the International Press Freedom Award by the
New York-based Committee to Protect Journalists.
	   CPJ's Africa coordinator, Kakuna Kerina, said in a statement
that her organization was seeking assurance from Eritrea that Ruth
had been released unconditionally, and said Ruth should be
compensated for her time behind bars.

Warne brought back to Australian team
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By TONY HARPER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Star spinner Shane Warne has been
restored to Australia's cricket team for the first time since
shoulder surgery in April following England's fourth test victory
in Melbourne.
	   Warne, who took a wicket with his first ball in Ashes play and
has dominated England ever since, will join fellow leg-spinner
Stuart MacGill and utility Colin Miller in the attack for the fifth
test, starting at the SCG on Saturday.
	   Australia, which has already retained the Ashes, leads the
series 2-1 with one to play following England's stirring 12-run win
in the fourth test which ended Tuesday.
	   Warne, who has more wickets than any other spin bowler in
history, replaces Matthew Nicholson for the SCG match. Nicholson
made his debut in the fourth test.
	   It is the only change to the 12-man squad.
	   Australia's media latched onto captain Mark Taylor's appraisal
that his team ``got lazy'' in its run chase Tuesday and probed a
sore point that the team has a bad record in run chases.
	   `Not Again _ Lazy Australia fall victim to Test jinx' summed it
up in the Sydney Telegraph. The Sydney Morning Herald added `Poms
stun lazy, frail Australians' in its main report but also noted
England's remarkable comeback with `How's that for a miracle?
England win a cricket Test.'
	   Herald cricket writer Malcolm Knox wrote, ``They were inept,
outclassed, pathetic, gutless and, to top it off, unlucky _ but if
the English team believed what was said about them, their captain
Alec Stewart said, `we'd be walking around with Kleenexes all the
time.'''
	   Australia, the world's leading test team, has nonetheless shown
a striking inability to reach low targets. It was the fourth time
in six years that Australia has failed to make less than 200 in the
second innings to win a match.
	   Australia's media was united in believing England's win had
brought new life to Ashes contests.
	   ``Australia lost a Test match but Ashes cricket gained a future
after England pulled off a stunning win to reacquaint Australia
with its chronic cricketing disease, Small Target Syndrome,'' wrote
the Telegraph's Robert Craddock.
	   Australian squad for fifth test: Mark Taylor (captain), Michael
Slater, Justin Langer, Mark Waugh, Steve Waugh, Darren Lehmann, Ian
Healy, Damien Fleming, Stuart MacGill, Colin Miller, Shane Warne,
Glenn McGrath.

Inquiries to follow Australian race disaster
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECAPS previous &QL; 
 &UR; By TONY HARPER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia _ Two inquiries will be held into the deadly
Sydney-to-Hobart yacht race amid claims that race organizers knew
of the potential danger 24 hours before the fleet was decimated by
a massive storm.
	   Four bodies were recovered and rescuers have given up hope of
finding two others presumed drowned in the worst death toll in the
54-year history of the event. Winds up to 90 mph (144 kph) and
waves 35 feet (11 meters) high carved a path of destruction through
the annual race this week.
	   A New South Wales government Coroner's inquiry has been ordered
to probe the loss of life while the Cruising Yacht Club of
Australia, the race organizer, will also investigate the disaster.
	   The club defended its decision to appoint immediate past
commodore Peter Bush to hold the inquiry, saying no independent
body could do as good a job.
	   The inquiries are certain to focus on the weather and what
information was passed on to the crew aboard the 115 yachts.
Seventy yachts had withdrawn from a race wrecked by the massive
waves and rescuers saved about 50 sailors from seven stricken
craft.
	   The Sydney Morning Herald newspaper Wednesday quoted an unnamed
source from the weather bureau as saying the yacht club and the
Australian Maritime Safety Authority were given early notice of the
approaching storm.
	   ``We gave them 24 hours notice and that is a long lead time for
weather at sea,'' the source said. ``Most times 12 hours is
considered to be satisfactory.''
	   The source said the information was passed on two hours after
the start of the race at Sydney Harbor on Dec. 26. The paper said
the weather bureau was concerned by reports that the fleet was
given no warning about the intensity of the storms.
	   Richard Winning, who captained the yacht Winston Churchill which
sank, killing three, admitted he had been told that conditions
would be bad.
	   ``I think we were given adequate information, yes,'' Winning
said.
	   Bush defended the yacht club holding its own inquiry, which will
be conducted in private with the report made public later.
	   ``I don't think by any stretch of the imagination that you want
to assume that this is not going to be an objective review,'' Bush
said Wednesday.
	   ``The single most important aspect all the way along in this
process, in the history of this race, is to make sure that we make
this event and all our yacht racing as safe as humanly possible.''
	   He said the inquiry would consider whether or not the race, won
by United States maxi Sayonara, should have been abandoned when the
storm hit.
	   ``We'll certainly look at that, but it's a very very difficult
thing under all circumstances to say look, the race should have
been called off,'' Bush said.
	   ``Had we called the race off when we were aware of the strength
of those conditions, little else could have happened other than
what happened because these guys were already on the race course.
	   ``And for us to say, `OK guys all stop racing and go home,'
they're still out there, they've still got 100 or 30 or 50 miles
(160 or 48 or 80 kilometers) to get to shore and it's not actually
as simple as that.''
	   Current club commodore Hugo van Kretschmar said the inquiry
would seek input from the weather bureau and the Maritime
Authority.
	   Van Kretschmar said he had opposed an abandonment of the race
because of the conditions and said it was run under international
rules leaving the responsibility with the individual skippers.
	   ``The unsinkable and unrollable yacht, like the Titanic, doesn't
exist,'' Van Kretschmar said.
	   The bodies of two members of the Winston Churchill, Jim Lawler
and Michael Bannister, were recovered from Bass Strait on Tuesday.
Two others, Bruce Guy and Phil Skeggs from Business Post Naiad,
were killed when their yacht rolled over Sunday during the peak of
the storms.
	   British Olympic Games sailor Glyn Charles, 33, and Australian
John Dean, 47, are presumed dead.
	   The Maritime Authority abandoned its search Tuesday afternoon,
saying that was an indication no hope was held for the pair.
	   Dean had told his family that when he died he wanted his ashes
spread at sea.
	   ``It looks like he has got his wish. At least he died doing
something he loved,'' said Dean's 15-year-old son Peter.
	   The crew on fifth-placed Nokia held a minute's silence when it
arrived in Hobart late Tuesday.
	   Skipper David Witt said Charles, swept off the deck of Sword of
Orion, had first considered sailing on Nokia.
	   ``At one stage I had 16 crew washed off the windward side by one
huge wave,'' Witt said. ``After that everyone but a vital six
remained on deck.''

	   SYDNEY, Australia _ Two inquiries will be held into the deadly
Sydney-to-Hobart yacht race amid claims that race organizers knew
of the potential danger 24 hours before the fleet was decimated by
a massive storm.
	   Four bodies were recovered and rescuers have given up hope of
finding two others presumed drowned in the worst death toll in the
54-year history of the event. Winds up to 90 mph (144 kph) and
waves 35 feet (11 meters) high carved a path of destruction through
the annual race this week.
	   A New South Wales government Coroner's inquiry has been ordered
to probe the loss of life while the Cruising Yacht Club of
Australia, the race organizer, will also investigate the disaster.
	   The club defended its decision to appoint immediate past
commodore Peter Bush to hold the inquiry, saying no independent
body could do as good a job.
	   The inquiries are certain to focus on the weather and what
information was passed on to the crew aboard the 115 yachts.
Seventy yachts had withdrawn from a race wrecked by the massive
waves and rescuers saved about 50 sailors from seven stricken
craft.
	   The Sydney Morning Herald newspaper Wednesday quoted an unnamed
source from the weather bureau as saying the yacht club and the
Australian Maritime Safety Authority were given early notice of the
approaching storm.
	   ``We gave them 24 hours notice and that is a long lead time for
weather at sea,'' the source said. ``Most times 12 hours is
considered to be satisfactory.''
	   The source said the information was passed on two hours after
the start of the race at Sydney Harbor on Dec. 26. The paper said
the weather bureau was concerned by reports that the fleet was
given no warning about the intensity of the storms.
	   Richard Winning, who captained the yacht Winston Churchill which
sank, killing three, admitted he had been told that conditions
would be bad.
	   ``I think we were given adequate information, yes,'' Winning
said.
	   Bush defended the yacht club holding its own inquiry, which will
be conducted in private with the report made public later.
	   ``I don't think by any stretch of the imagination that you want
to assume that this is not going to be an objective review,'' Bush
said Wednesday.
	   ``The single most important aspect all the way along in this
process, in the history of this race, is to make sure that we make
this event and all our yacht racing as safe as humanly possible.''
	   He said the inquiry would consider whether or not the race, won
by United States maxi Sayonara, should have been abandoned when the
storm hit.
	   ``We'll certainly look at that, but it's a very very difficult
thing under all circumstances to say look, the race should have
been called off,'' Bush said.
	   ``Had we called the race off when we were aware of the strength
of those conditions, little else could have happened other than
what happened because these guys were already on the race course.
	   ``And for us to say, `OK guys all stop racing and go home,'
they're still out there, they've still got 100 or 30 or 50 miles
(160 or 48 or 80 kilometers) to get to shore and it's not actually
as simple as that.''
	   Current club commodore Hugo van Kretschmar said the inquiry
would seek input from the weather bureau and the Maritime
Authority.
	   Van Kretschmar said he had opposed an abandonment of the race
because of the conditions and said it was run under international
rules leaving the responsibility with the individual skippers.
	   ``The unsinkable and unrollable yacht, like the Titanic, doesn't
exist,'' Van Kretschmar said.
	   The bodies of two members of the Winston Churchill, Jim Lawler
and Michael Bannister, were recovered from Bass Strait on Tuesday.
Two others, Bruce Guy and Phil Skeggs from Business Post Naiad,
were killed when their yacht rolled over Sunday during the peak of
the storms.
	   British Olympic Games sailor Glyn Charles, 33, and Australian
John Dean, 47, are presumed dead.
	   The Maritime Authority abandoned its search Tuesday afternoon,
saying that was an indication no hope was held for the pair.
	   Dean had told his family that when he died he wanted his ashes
spread at sea.
	   ``It looks like he has got his wish. At least he died doing
something he loved,'' said Dean's 15-year-old son Peter.
	   The crew on fifth-placed Nokia held a minute's silence when it
arrived in Hobart late Tuesday.
	   Skipper David Witt said Charles, swept off the deck of Sword of
Orion, had first considered sailing on Nokia.
	   ``At one stage I had 16 crew washed off the windward side by one
huge wave,'' Witt said. ``After that everyone but a vital six
remained on deck.''

In NBA lockout, absence of negotiations leads to more rhetoric
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By CHRIS SHERIDAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ While the commissioner of the U.S. National
Basketball Association skied in Colorado and his deputy sunned in
Florida, NBA players and agents stewed on the telephone Tuesday as
the lockout approached its half-year anniversary.
	   ``If the league doesn't want to play, then we don't need to wait
until Jan. 7. Just cancel the season,'' said Jerome Stanley, an
agent who represents five players in the lower- and middle-income
ranges. ``But if they're not going to cancel the season, then crank
it back up. We don't need any more gesturing or grandstanding, just
do some tradeoffs and end the thing.''
	   Stanley and two other agents held a conference call with
reporters while players participated on a different conference call
with union leadership.
	   Commissioner David Stern, meantime, was still vacationing in
Aspen, and deputy commissioner Russ Granik was in Florida with his
family. Neither is expected back in New York until the new year.
	   The lockout, essentially a strike by the owners, is now entering
its sixth month.
	   The league has scheduled a Board of Governors meeting for Jan.
7, and Stern and Granik have said they will recommend canceling the
season if no agreement has been reached by that date.
	   The league says it has made its final offer, and no further
talks are scheduled.
	   A hearing will be held Wednesday in Houston federal court on a
lawsuit filed by players Nick Van Exel, Marcus Camby and Reggie
Slater charging USA Basketball and the NBA with denying them
clearance to play in Europe.
	   The lockout, essentially a strike by the owners, is now entering
its sixth month.
	   ``No matter where the thing ends, the league is going to end up
with a good, a very good, deal _ almost a dream deal,'' Stanley
said. ``If you took the same deal and offered it to baseball and
football owners, they'd hop all over it.
	   ``This is first sports industry to cap top end salaries,''
Stanley said. ``Calculate how much money the Los Angeles Lakers
would save by not having to pay Shaquille O'Neal and Kobe Bryant
what they would have had to pay under the old deal. That money has
already been transferred. That's the offer we're making.
	   Stanley and agents Keith Glass and Steve Kauffman said the
lockout had been ``scripted, orchestrated and pre-planned'' by the
owners.
	   Kauffman said he was beginning to believe that the league
doesn't want a season, and Glass called Stern's negotiating conduct
``disgraceful.''
	   Under a league-wide gag order, general managers, like all NBA
employees, are forbidden from discussing the lockout. Violators
face seven-figure fines and the loss of draft picks.

Maier fills Austria's gap in downhill
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By PIERO VALSECCHI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BORMIO, Italy (AP) _ Following three failures, Austria needed a
downhill victory to put its seal on the men's World Cup.
	   Hermann ``The Herminator'' Maier and his Austrian teammates came
through on Tuesday with an unprecedented 1-6 finish in the fourth
speed race of the season.
	   The Austrian triumph at Bormio, down the icy and twisty Stelvio
course which will host the World Cup finals in 2000, followed an
all-time 1-9 record finish by the Austrian skiers _ with Maier
again leading the pack _ in last week's Super-G at Innsbruck.
	   Austria's domination in seven of the 13 World Cup races held so
far _ three Super-Gs, two giant slaloms, one downhill and one
slalom _ left the opponents battered and hopeless.
	   ``They look unbeatable,'' said Italy's Peter Runggaldier, one of
the only three non-Austrians to finish in the top 11 at Bormio.
	   ``They are a strong team, with Maier as charismatic leader,'' he
added.
	   Maier earned the No.1 spot on the ``Power Team'' last season by
clinching 10 World Cup wins, the overall title and two Olympic
golds at Nagano.
	   He has added four World Cup wins this season in three different
disciplines.
	   On Tuesday the 26-year-old ski superstar from Flachau showed no
fear as he charged down the 3,070-meter-long (3,359-yard-long)
course beating runnerup Fritz Stobl by 0.70 seconds and third-place
Stephan Eberharter by 1.28.
	   It was Maier's first downhill victory since his dramatic and
spectacular spill at the Nagano Olympics in February. Quickly
recovered from the downhill crash Maier then went on to win the
Super-G and giant slalom titles.
	   ``I really wanted a downhill victory after Nagano .. I was brave
to win on a tough, difficult course,'' Maier said.
	   The Austrian ace said he was now looking forward to the
prestigious downhill race of Wengen, in January, for a double at
the Swiss track after his consecutive wins in Bormio.
	   Before Wengen Maier could improve his record of wins and his
World Cup overall lead in three giant slaloms _ the first at
Kranjska Gora on Jan. 6 - and a Super-G at Schladming.
	   Tuesday's victory gave Maier a commanding lead of 640 points
overall, 103 ahead of Norway's Lasse Kjus.
	   Kjus, who upset the Austrians in the first two downhills of the
season and finished second to Italy's Kristian Ghedina in the
third, did not start in Bormio because of a bronchitis and did not
pocket any point.
	   There were seven Austrians among the top ten in the Cup overall
standings and six among the top nine in the downhill lists.

	   SANTA CLARA, Cuba (AP) _ The remains of 10 leftist guerrillas
who fought alongside Ernesto ``Che'' Guevara came to central Cuba
on Tuesday, where Cubans by the thousands lined up to view the
small coffins.
	   The most famed of the group was Haydee Tamara Bunke Bider, known
as ``Tania,'' who met Guevara while working as an East German
translator and went on to join his effort to spread revolution
throughout Latin America.
	   A large-scale ceremony was planned Wednesday to inter the
remains alongside those of Guevara and others of his comrades who
fell in Bolivia in 1967. Guevara's remains were placed in a large
mausoleum-monument here last year.
	   The ceremony falls on the 40th anniversary of the Battle of
Santa Clara, in which Guevara's rebel forces defeated the Cuban
army of dictator Fulgencio Batista, who fled Cuba early on Jan. 1,
1959.
	   Along with Bunke's remains are those of two Cubans and seven
Bolivians who died in Guevara's failed effort to create a
Cuban-style rebellion against the Bolivian government.
	   Residents of Santa Clara formed long lines throughout Tuesday to
file past the coffins at a library on the city plaza, repeating on
a smaller scale last year's honors for Guevara prior to his
interment at the mausoleum.
	   Bunke, born in Argentina, met Guevara when he made a commercial
visit to East Germany in 1960. She later came to Cuba and worked in
government agencies before going to Bolivia on a clandestine
mission to support Guevara's rebellion. She eventually joined his
forces as a fighter.

Iraq says it is defying allied-patrolled no-fly zones
</HEADLINE>

	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Despite a confrontation this week with
Western warplanes, Iraq is remaining defiant.
	   The Baghdad government announced Tuesday that it its aircraft
are flying in the ``no-fly'' zones patrolled by U.S. and British
warplanes. It also said Iraqi anti-aircraft batteries remain ready
to fire on allied planes.
	   U.S. officials would not say whether Iraqi aircraft encountered
in the zones would be shot down, and American and British military
officials were skeptical of the Iraqi vice president's assertion
planes took to the air.
	   Iraq's latest move came only a day after U.S. warplanes fired on
an Iraqi anti-aircraft position in northern Iraq, killing four
Iraqi soldiers. Washington said the planes attacked after Iraq shot
missiles at aircraft patrolling in one of two ``no-fly'' zones set
up after the 1991 Gulf War.
	   The Iraqi announcement appeared aimed at building support among
Arabs who angrily protested mid-December U.S.-British airstrikes,
but whose governments did little to back Iraqi demands for lifting
8-year-old U.N. sanctions that have devastated the country.
	   Vice President Taha Yassin Ramadan, asked by Associated Press
Television News whether Iraq was flying aircraft in ``no-fly''
zones, said: ``We are doing it right now.''
	   ``Iraqi planes in effect are flying in a normal manner in Iraqi
airspace,'' he said.
	   Ramadan did not specify whether the aircraft were military or
civilian, but almost all of Iraq's passenger aircraft are either
out of the country or unusable. All aircraft in Iraq are owned by
the government.
	   In Washington, Col. Richard Bridges said there were no immediate
reports of Iraqi aircraft in northern and southern ``no-fly''
zones. And Lt. Col. Stephen Campbell said the United States and
Britain would continue to enforce the zones.
	   A spokesman for the British Defense Ministry, who spoke on
customary condition of anonymity, also reported no Iraqi air
activity and added Britain was ready to take action ``should the
conditions of the `no-fly' zones be breached.''
	   The United States, Britain and France set up ``no-fly'' zones in
northern and southern Iraq to protect Kurds and Shiite Muslims from
air attack after forces loyal to President Saddam Hussein put down
twin rebellions after Iraq's defeat in the 1991 war.
	   France withdrew from northern zone patrols in 1996. Foreign
Ministry spokeswoman Anne Gazeau-Secret confirmed in Paris that
French planes stopped participating in patrols over southern Iraq
on Dec. 16, the first day of airstrikes.
	   There were no flights over the northern ``no-fly'' zone on
Tuesday ``strictly due to weather and nothing else,'' said Lt. Col.
Jane Rinell, a U.S. military spokeswoman.
	   A spokesman for the southern zone said flights continued and
``there were no disturbances'' from the Iraqi side.
	   Iraq has never recognized the zones, and Ramadan repeated the
government's view Tuesday.
	   ``The so-called air exclusion zones exist only in the sick
imagination of the British and American administrations,'' he said.
	   He also stressed Iraqi anti-aircraft batteries were ready to
fire on allied aircraft inside Iraq. ``The war is still on,'' he
said.
	   Iraqi newspapers on Tuesday applauded the public protests in
Arab capitals after the United States and Britain bombed Iraq for
four nights beginning Dec. 16.
	   The airstrikes were ordered after U.N. weapons inspectors
reported Iraq was blocking their work. The U.N. sanctions, imposed
after Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait, will not be lifted until the
inspectors declare Iraq is free of weapons of mass destruction.
	   In a front-page editorial, the al-Qadissiya newspaper warned
Arab leaders that ignoring ``the snowballing Arab wrath ... will
shake the ground from under their feet.''

Dollar higher against yen, Tokyo stocks open lower
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The U.S. dollar edged higher against the yen early
Wednesday in light, end-of-year trading. Share prices fell at the
open of the year's last session.
	   The dollar bought 115.70 yen in early trading, up 0.34 yen from
late Tuesday and also above its late New York level of 115.53 yen
overnight.
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average fell 2.84 points,
or 0.02 percent, to 13,844.06 points in the first 30 minutes of
trading. On Tuesday, the average closed up 137.84 points, or 1.01
percent.
	   The Tokyo Stock Exchange closes out the year Wednesday with a
half-day session. It will reopen on Jan. 4, 1999.
	   In currency dealings, the dollar remained in a narrow range amid
the year-end lull. Many players were also holding back to await the
Jan. 1 launch of Europe's single currency, the euro.
	   On the stock market, share prices were under pressure as a drop
in bond prices rekindled fears about the recent turmoil in credit
markets.
	   But trades remained extremely sparse as most investors were
already away for the New Year's holidays.
	   ``Bond futures are not showing favorable moves, and that is
creating poor sentiment in the stock market,'' said Kenji Karikomi,
general manager of the equity department at Daiwa Securities.
	   Still, traders expected the market to remain relatively
supported Wednesday due to the overnight rise in New York stocks,
where the Dow Jones industrial average closed at 9,320.98 points,
up 94.23.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section was down 2.54 points, or 0.23 percent, to 1,086.29.
The TOPIX closed up 8.94 points, or 0.83 percent, the day before.
	   The yield on the benchmark No. 203 10-year Japanese government
bond rose to 1.960 percent from Tuesday's finish of 1.885 percent,
driving its price down to 98.72 yen from 99.31 yen.

	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Star spinner Shane Warne has been
restored to Australia's cricket team for the first time since
shoulder surgery in April following England's fourth test victory
in Melbourne.
	   Warne, who took a wicket with his first ball in Ashes play and
has dominated England ever since, will join fellow leg-spinner
Stuart MacGill and utility Colin Miller in the attack for the fifth
test, starting at the SCG on Saturday.
	   Australia, which has already retained the Ashes, leads the
series 2-1 with one to play following England's stirring 12-run win
in the fourth test which ended Tuesday.
	   Warne, who has more wickets than any other spin bowler in
history, replaces Matthew Nicholson for the SCG match. Nicholson
made his debut in the fourth test.
	   It is the only change to the 12-man squad.
	   Warne has been below his best since returning from his
nine-month break but said he was confident of making an impact.
	   ``There's no drama with my shoulder any more,'' Warne said.
	   He added that if captain Mark Taylor wanted him ``to bowl as
many overs as possible, I can.''
	   Warne has played three Sheffield Shield matches this season and
in his previous game took 1-118 from 30 overs against Queensland.
	   Meanwhile, Australia's media latched onto Taylor's appraisal
that his team ``got lazy'' in its run chase Tuesday and probed a
sore point that the team has a bad record in run chases.
	   `Not Again _ Lazy Australia fall victim to Test jinx' summed it
up in the Sydney Telegraph. The Sydney Morning Herald added `Poms
stun lazy, frail Australians' in its main report but also noted
England's remarkable comeback with `How's that for a miracle?
England win a cricket Test.'
	   Herald cricket writer Malcolm Knox wrote, ``They were inept,
outclassed, pathetic, gutless and, to top it off, unlucky _ but if
the English team believed what was said about them, their captain
Alec Stewart said, `we'd be walking around with Kleenexes all the
time.'''
	   Australia, the world's leading test team, has nonetheless shown
a striking inability to reach low targets. It was the fourth time
in six years that Australia has failed to make less than 200 in the
second innings to win a match.
	   Australia's media was united in believing England's win had
brought new life to Ashes contests.
	   ``Australia lost a Test match but Ashes cricket gained a future
after England pulled off a stunning win to reacquaint Australia
with its chronic cricketing disease, Small Target Syndrome,'' wrote
the Telegraph's Robert Craddock.
	   Australian squad for fifth test: Mark Taylor (captain), Michael
Slater, Justin Langer, Mark Waugh, Steve Waugh, Darren Lehmann, Ian
Healy, Damien Fleming, Stuart MacGill, Colin Miller, Shane Warne,
Glenn McGrath.

U.S. subsidiary of Mexican legwear concern sold to Italian company

	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Hosiery manufacturer Kayser-Roth Corp., a
unit of Mexican legwear concern Synkro SA, said Tuesday that it
reached a final agreement to sell the U.S. company to Italy-based
Golden Lady, S.P.A.
	   Synkro's chairman Luis Gutierrez had announced in late October
that Synkro's board agreed to sell Legwear Holdings, the holding
company for Kayser-Roth, to North Carolina-based Americal Corp. for
dlrs 62 million.
	   But Jerry Perlmutter, vice-president and general counsel of
Kayser-Roth, told Dow Jones Newswires that the sale to Golden Lady
is expected to be completed Jan. 31, 1999. Financial terms of the
transaction weren't disclosed.
	   Perlmutter said the sale was conducted by Synkro executives in
Mexico City. Synkro officials couldn't be reached for comment.
	   Mexico's state-run Bank Savings Protection Fund, also known as
Fobaproa, assumed rights from local banks which had converted
Synkro's debt into stakes in the hosiery concern.
	   Gutierrez said in late October that he didn't know how many
banks had renegotiated their interests in Synkro with Fobaproa. He
declined to say which banks have stakes in Synkro, but said 90
percent of the company's shares are held by Mexican banks.
	   Fobaproa assumed about dlrs 60 billion in non-performing loans
from local banks after the crisis triggered by the December 1994
peso devaluation forced hundred of thousands of debtors to default
on their loans.
	   When Synkro announced Kayser-Roth's sale to North Carolina-based
Americal, Gutierrez said the company decided not to divest its
Mexican hosiery units Cannon and Canofil.
	   Kayser-Roth's Perlmutter added that Americal emerged earlier
this year as leader of the bidding process and won exclusive rights
to conduct a due diligence process, but both parts failed to reach
an agreement.
	   A source close to the Americal transaction, who spoke on
condition of anonymity, said Americal never received an official
response stating why Kayser-Roth was sold to Golden Lady.
	   Americal offered dlrs 62 million for Kayser-Roth, but approached
New York investment bank Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, which
coordinated the transaction, and said the company was overpriced,
the source said.
	   Soon afterwards Kayser-Roth was sold to the Italian concern for
an undisclosed amount, the source added.
	   Kayser-Roth said in a news release Tuesday that Golden Lady, a
privately owned company, is the largest manufacturer, marketer and
distributor of sheer hosiery in Europe with revenues of about dlrs
400 million a year. The Mantova-based concern has 3,000 employees
in six manufacturing facilities, four distribution centers and 600
retail boutiques throughout Europe.
	   Kayser-Roth has about 2,500 workers and average annual sales of
dlrs 290 million.
	   Nerino Grassi, president of Golden Lady, said in the news
release that taking advantage of the synergies between Golden Lady
and Kayser-Roth ``will result in a major force in the world legwear
market.''

Palestinian statehood takes center stage in Israeli elections
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By LAURA KING &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israel's national election is months away, but
already the biggest campaign issue is an event that hasn't
happened, in a place yet to be determined, under circumstances no
candidate is eager to talk about in stump speeches.
	   That issue is Palestinian statehood.
	   With direct voting for Israel's next prime minister set for May
17, the election countdown nearly coincides with the independence
timetable that Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat has used for months
now to rattle Israel's nerves and bolster his own people's sagging
spirits.
	   Arafat has said repeatedly that Palestinians have the right to
declare statehood on May 4 _ the date under which the interim Oslo
accords expire, by Palestinian interpretation _ whether or not
terms of the new state have been negotiated with Israel.
	   The hard-line government of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
has threatened a drastic response to any unilateral Palestinian
declaration of independence, such as annexing large chunks of the
new state's West Bank heartland.
	   Coupled with an impasse in the peace process, the election
campaign represents a high-stakes showdown over statehood _ not
only between Israel and the Palestinians, but among the various
candidates for prime minister.
	   At least five politicians have already declared their
candidacies, including several one-time allies who are now turning
on one another. More are waiting in the wings.
	   Netanyahu has already tried to pre-empt the statehood issue,
boasting that Palestinians wouldn't dare declare independence two
weeks before the election for fear of propelling him _ their
nemesis _ back into office.
	   But the Palestinians could just as easily warn that if he did
win the election, they would respond with a swift statehood
declaration.
	   Arafat and his inner circle have already shown they are capable
of adjusting the tenor of statehood comments to fit their agenda of
the moment.
	   In September, Arafat's aides promised he would use a speech at
the U.N. General Assembly to make an unambiguous call for
Palestinian statehood. But at U.S. urging, he softened his comments
considerably, helping pave the way for the Wye River summit the
next month with Netanyahu.
	   Similar mixed signals have emerged in recent days. On Monday,
Palestinian negotiator Hassan Asfour suggested Arafat might hold
off on a statehood declaration because it could drive jittery
Israeli voters into the Netanyahu camp.
	   On Tuesday, though, Palestinian parliament speaker Ahmed Qureia,
known as Abu Ala, said May 4 statehood plans were as alive as ever.
	   ``Everything is as scheduled,'' he told The Associated Press.
``It's a historical and serious and very important date, and our
decision hasn't changed.''
	   Such contradictory comments reflect genuine debate among
Palestinians as to whether a speedy declaration would serve their
interests or wreck chances for negotiating a better deal later.
	   On the Israeli side, Netanyahu's opponents have said as little
as possible about statehood prospects. That's especially true of
challenger Ehud Barak, whose dovish Labor Party already stands
accused by Netanyahu of colluding with Arafat.
	   But Israeli public opinion is changing. U.S. President Bill
Clinton's visit earlier this month was seen not only by
Palestinians but by many Israelis as setting a seal of approval on
Palestinian statehood aspirations. Even key Israeli conservatives
are now saying it's bound to happen.
	   Each side has a strong interest in reaching accommodation. A
declaration of statehood with so many explosive issues unresolved _
its borders, Jewish settlements, the status of Jerusalem, which
both sides claim as their capital _ could prove highly dangerous
for both.

Four Westerners killed in bloody end to Yemen kidnapping
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SAN`A, Yemen (AP) _ Troops surrounded a band of Islamic
extremists holding 16 Western tourists hostage and opened fire,
bringing a bloody end to the kidnapping that left four Westerners
dead and two others injured.
	   The remaining 10 hostages were freed unharmed following
Tuesday's military operation, in which three kidnappers died.
	   Yemen's Interior Ministry said the kidnappers had killed three
of the captives and that a fourth died later in hospital.
	   It was not immediately clear if the victims were slain before or
during the fighting between extremists and some 200 Yemen security
forces.
	   U.S. State Department spokesman Lee McClenny said that according
to the Yemen government, troops stormed the hideout only after the
kidnappers began killing the hostages.
	   The 16 tourists _ 12 Britons, two Americans and two Australians
_ were kidnapped Monday near the southern town of Mawdiyah, about
175 miles (280 kms) south of the capital, San`a.
	   The nationalities of the dead were unclear. The Interior
Ministry said all those killed were British, but the United States
and Britain both said an Australian was among the dead. The other
tourists injured in the clash were an American woman and a British
woman. Names of the tourists were unavailable.
	   Three of the kidnappers, including an Egyptian, were killed, the
Interior Ministry said. It was not immediately known if there were
any other kidnappers and whether they had been apprehended.
	   The kidnapping began Monday when the tourists' convoy of five
vehicles was ambushed by men who opened fire on their police
escorts. The kidnappers threatened to kill the tourists if the
police did not back off, Yemeni security officials said.
	   Tribesmen in unruly Yemen have frequently kidnapped tourists to
pressure the government into providing them with new roads, water
or clinics. But the hostages generally have been treated as guests
and released unharmed.
	   Four Germans are being held by a tribe in northeast Yemen. The
kidnappers are demanding more schools, hospitals and telephone
lines in their area.
	   The latest incident marked the first time an abduction was
carried out by Islamic extremists. Security officials said the
kidnappers belong to Islamic Jihad, many of whose leaders fought
Russian troops in Afghanistan. The group is believed to have about
200 members.
	   The Interior Ministry said members of the ``extremist terrorist
gang'' killed three of the captives _ two men and a woman.
	   ``They proceeded in killing the captives after refusing any
attempts at negotiations, which led security forces to storm the
area to prevent further bloodshed and ensure the safe release of
the rest of the hostages,'' the statement said.
	   The bodies of the dead and injured tourists were ferried by
government helicopter to a hospital in the southern port city of
Aden, security officials said. The other tourists were escorted by
troops to a hotel in Aden.
	   After the shootout, security forces detained scores of suspected
Islamic extremists, said the officials, who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
	   The kidnappers had demanded the release of their leader, Saleh
Haidara al-Atwi, who was detained two weeks ago as part of a
government crackdown on Islamic vigilantes who had been enforcing
strict Islamic rules in southern Yemen, security officials said.
	   Islamic Jihad members reportedly were flogging women who did not
observe the Islamic dress code and men for selling and drinking
alcohol, which is forbidden in Islam.
	   The kidnappers also wanted the release of another leader, the
officials said. They did not identify him.
	   The group ran a military camp in southern Yemen, security
officials said.
	   Yemen was once a haven for Islamic militant fugitives from other
countries, but the government has expelled many of them.
	   Before the shootout, Yemeni officials tried to negotiate with
the kidnappers while security forces encircled the area.
	   Ahmad Ali Mohsen, governor of Abyan province, where the
kidnapping took place, was leading the talks with leaders of the
Al-Fadl tribe, to which the kidnappers belong, an official at the
governor's office said.
	   A London-based Islamic human rights group said Tuesday that it
had contacted the kidnappers the night before and received
assurances that they would not harm the hostages.
	   ``They promised not to harm the hostages,'' said a spokesman for
the Islamic Observation Center. ``We hold the Yemeni government
responsible for the deaths. The way the authorities handled the
situation was barbaric and irresponsible.''

Nomura Securities to cut 650 overseas jobs
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Nomura Securities Co., Japan's biggest brokerage,
will cut 650 overseas jobs next year as part of a major
restructuring campaign, a company official said Wednesday.
	   Facing massive losses in its overseas operations, the company
will shed nearly 20 percent of its work force in Europe and the
Americas and close some overseas offices, Nomura representative
Kimizo Hayakawa said.
	   At the same time, the company will hire 50 new employees in Asia
outside Japan to strengthen securities operations in Taiwan and the
Philippines, he said.
	   As of the end of September, Nomura employed 4,600 people outside
Japan, including 1,400 in North and South America and 2,300 in
Europe.
	   Through the planned job cuts, to be carried out by March 1999,
the company hopes to reduce fixed overseas costs by 30 billion yen
(dlrs 259 million), targeting overseas businesses that sustained
big losses in the first half of fiscal 1998.
	   Nomura announced in October that it would cut 2,000 jobs from
its 13,000-strong domestic work force by 2001 and close about 20
percent of its Japanese retail outlets to cope with the nation's
economic recession.
	   At that time, the company reported 207.2 billion yen (dlrs 1.76
billion) in losses, mostly from foreign operations, for the first
half of fiscal 1998.

Azharuddin blasts teammates for lack of commitment
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; By IHITHISHAM KAMARDEEN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) _ Indian skipper Mohammed
Azharuddin blasted his teammates for a lack of commitment after New
Zealand took a 1-0 series lead with a four-wicket win in the second
test at Basin Reserve Wednesday.
	   Set 213 to win, Craig McMillan (74 not out) and Chris Cairns
(61) lifted the hosts from a dangerous 74 for five with a 137-run
partnership which ended just before the victory was wrapped up.
	   ``The effort on the field was not good enough,'' said an angry
Azharuddin. ``Our problem area is the fielding and unless that
changes we are not going to win test matches. I don't know when we
will wake up and realize that there is a problem with our
fielding.''
	   When asked what could be done to rectify it, Azharuddin said, if
he knew, he wouldn't be sitting and complaining.
	   India dropped seven catches in the two New Zealand innings and
his counterpart Stephen Fleming agreed the home side's superior
catching tilted the balance in its favor.
	   ``When you are defending you can't afford to give away easy runs
and drop catches. And that's exactly what we did,'' Azharuddin
said. We were in a good position at stumps on the fourth day. But
we didn't bowl well at all today.''
	   India's last series win outside the sub continent was a 2-0 win
over England in 1986 and since beating Sri Lanka by 235 runs in
Colombo in July 1993, India has failed to win a test abroad in 18
attempts.
	   While McMillan remained unbeaten, Cairns was dismissed two runs
shy of the victory. Dion Nash who hit an unbeaten 89 in the New
Zealand first innings, hit medium paceman Javagal Srinath to the
fine leg boundary to complete the win 23 minutes after lunch.
	   New Zealand had resumed the day needing 140 runs to win with six
wickets in hand.
	   But night watchman Paul Wiseman fell to the fifth ball of the
morning.
	   McMillan's innings lasted 12 minutes over three hours and
included six boundaries off 121 balls. Cairns, who went wicketless
in the match, followed up his first innings four, hitting nine
boundaries and a six in his 107-ball knock.
	   Fleming described the test as the ``most mentally demanding'' in
his 38-match career and said the post-lunch session on the fourth
day was the ``most pivotal'' in his side's push for a result.
	   ``Both teams had equal chances in the test and I think at the
end we won more sessions than them,'' Fleming said.
	   Fleming said beating a top side like India was a sweet feeling.
	   ``In the past we have beaten Sri Lanka and Zimbabwe at home. It
is good to win a test against a team like India,'' Fleming added.
	   ``When it came to the crunch I think we handled the pressure
better than them. I think McMillan and Cairns responded to the
challenge remarkably.''
	   Fleming registered his sixth win in 14 games as captain.
	   Swing bowler Simon Doull who took a career-best 7-65 in a
nine-wicket match haul was voted the man-of-the match.
	   New Zealand has replaced Nathan Astle with left hander Roger
Twose for the final third test starting in Hamilton on Jan. 2.
Astle suffered a broken hand during this match.

Palmeiras Wins Cup
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By Jamie McGeever &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SAO PAULO, Brazil (AP) _ Palmeiras beat Cruzeiro 1-0 Tuesday
night in the final match of the inaugural Mercosur Cup, lifting the
trophy and the dlrs 4.7 million cash prize offered by the South
American Soccer Confederation.
	   Cruzeiro won the opening match in Belo Horizonte 2-1, but
Palmeiras turned the tables in the second game with a 3-1 victory
in Sao Paulo last Sunday, before clinching victory in the
three-match series.
	   The win brings Palmeiras its second major title of the year,
after a Brazilian Cup win - also against Cruzeiro - and brings down
the curtain on a disappointing 1998 for Cruzeiro, which lost all
three national finals it disputed.
	   The winning goal came 15 minutes into the second half, and
perhaps fittingly, from Paraguayan international right-back Arce,
the only non-Brazilian Mercosur-born player on the field.
	   Brazilian internationalist Junior Baiano blasted a 30-yard free
kick through Cruzeiro's defensive wall, which goalkeeper Dida did
well to block. The rebound fell kindly to the oncoming Arce, who
swept the ball home from eight yards to the delight of the partisan
home crowd.
	   The first half opened brightly, with fast, incisive, and
committed football from both sides, particularly Palmeiras. Paulo
Nunes, Zinho, and Alex looked in the mood.
	   Just as quickly, however, the game became tense and littered
with fouls. Referee Luciano Almeida began to lose respect from the
22 players on the pitch, with a series of inconsistent and erratic
decisions which favored neither team. Most glaring of all was his
failure to produce the red card for Palmeiras midfielder Thiago for
a crude tackle from behind on Valdo, only minutes after he was
booked for a rash challenge on Gilberto.
	   The highlight of the half was a fine save by Palmeiras
goalkeeper Velloso from a curling Valdo free kick.
	   Cruzeiro's urgency at the start of the second 45 minutes stung a
strangely pedestrian Palmeiras into action, with a Junior Baiano
free kick almost smashing the crossbar in two.
	   After Palmeiras broke the deadlock, play opened up, as Cruzeiro
pushed forward in search of the equalizer, and the effects of an
ardous season began to tell. Simmering tempers came to the boil,
and Cruzeiro's Marcelo Ramos was sent off for his second yellow
card offence ten minutes from the end.

<TEXT>
	   NASHVILLE, Tennessee (AP) _ Virginia Tech beat Alabama 38 to 7
in Nashville's inaugural Music City Bowl.
	   The Hokies, who had never beaten Alabama in 10 previous tries,
intercepted three passes, blocked two punts and recovered a muffed
punt in routing the Crimson Tide 38-7.
	   The victory ended a two-game losing streak in bowls for Virginia
Tech (9-3), one of only 10 teams to go to a bowl in each of the
last six years. The Hokies also picked up their first-ever victory
over a Southeastern Conference team.
	   The Hokies, who ranked second in the country with 23
interceptions this season, set the tone when Keion Carpenter got to
Pope on his first punt of the game, and Ryan Smith intercepted
Zow's pass on Alabama's second possession.
	   Virginia Tech led 10-7 at halftime and then put the game away
with 28 unanswered points.
	   Andrew Zow was throwing from his own end zone when Phillip
Summers picked off his pass and returned it to the Alabama 2.
Lamont Pegues scored from a yard out two plays later for a 17-7
lead.
	   Moore got his hand on Pope's punt on Alabama's next possession,
and Summers recovered at the Alabama 29. Shyrone Stith ran in from
4 yards out a minute later for a 24-7 lead.
	   Jimmy Kibble got into the act with a 49-yard punt that backed up
Alabama's Arvin Richards, who had the ball bounce off him into the
arms of Tech's Cory Bird. That set up Pegues' second TD run of the
game for a 31-7 lead with 13:31 left.
	   Anthony Midget ended the scoring by stepping in front of Zow's
pass and returning it 27 yards for a TD midway through the final
quarter.
	   Al Clark gave the Hokies a 7-0 lead by scrambling 43 yards on
the opening possession, and the Hokies ended Alabama's first two
possessions with a blocked punt and an interception. The Hokies,
however, turned the ball over after the blocked kick and then
missed a field goal attempt after the interception.
	   Zow managed to keep Alabama close with an 18-play, 75-yard drive
that used up nearly 10 minutes in the first half. He capped the
drive by finding Michael Vaughn in the back of the end zone with a
5-yard TD pass to tie the game 7-7.
	   Shayne Graham put Virginia Tech ahead to stay with a 44-yard
field goal with 6:41 left in the second quarter.

Dollar higher against yen, Tokyo stocks close lower

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The U.S. dollar rose marginally against the yen
Wednesday in thin, year-end trading. Share prices closed lower in
the last trading session of 1998.
	   The dollar bought 115.64 yen at late morning, up 0.28 yen from
late Tuesday and also above its late New York level of 115.53 yen
overnight.
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average fell 4.73 points,
or 0.03 percent, to finish at 13,842.17 points. On Tuesday, the
average closed up 137.84 points, or 1.01 percent.
	   The Tokyo Stock Exchange closed out the year with a half-day
session. It will reopen on Jan. 4, 1999.
	   In currency dealings, the dollar remained in a narrow range amid
the year-end lull. Even a sharp drop in government bond prices did
not spur currency traders to action.
	   Many players were also holding back to await the Jan. 1 launch
of Europe's single currency, the euro.
	   On the stock market, stocks finished lower as the plunging bond
prices rekindled fears about recent turmoil in credit markets.
	   But trades remained extremely sparse as most investors were
already away for the New Year's holidays.
	   When trading resumes next year, investors will be closely
monitoring talks between the ruling Liberal Democratic Party and
the opposition Liberal Party on forming a coalition government,
analysts said.
	   ``The domestic political and economic situations remain
uncertain,'' said Sachio Ishikawa, a general manager at Chuo
Securities.
	   Still, Wednesday's market got some support from an overnight
rise on Wall Street, where the Dow Jones industrial average closed
at 9,320.98 points, up 94.23.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section closed down 1.84 points, or 0.17 percent, at
1,086.99. The TOPIX closed up 8.94 points, or 0.83 percent, the day
before.
	   Advances outnumbered declines 576 to 490, with 191 issues
unchanged.
	   The yield on the benchmark No. 203 10-year Japanese government
bond soared to 2.010 percent from Tuesday's finish of 1.885
percent, the highest it has been in 15 1/2 months.
	   The bond's price, which moves in the opposite direction,
finished the year at 98.33 yen, down from 99.31 yen.

Prominent Japanese film director Keisuke Kinoshita dies at 86

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Keisuke Kinoshita, a prominent Japanese director
noted for tackling contemporary social problems and depicting the
beauty of human weakness in his films, died at his home in Tokyo on
Wednesday, his family said. He was 86.
	   The cause of death was a stroke, said a family member.
	   Kinoshita, a native of Hamamatsu in central Japan, joined what
is now Shochiku Co., one of Japan's major movie companies, in 1933.
	   The following year, he made his directorial debut with
``Hanasaku Minato'' (The Port where Flowers Bloom) in 1943, the
same year Akira Kurosawa directed his first film. Kurosawa, one of
Japan's most famous filmmakers, died at the age of 88 on Sept. 6.
	   Kinoshita's most successful and best known film was ``Nijushi No
Hitomi'' (Twenty-four Eyes), which won the Kinema Jumpo Award, one
of Japan's top cinema prizes, as the best movie of 1954.
	   It depicts the warm relationship between a female teacher and 12
pupils over the course of three decades, including the devastation
of World War II.
	   ``Kinoshita depicted the feelings and beauty of human weakness,
in contrast to Kurosawa, who depicted people's strength,'' said
Taichi Yamada, a noted Japanese playwright.
	   Kinoshita's other famous films include ``Karumen Kokyo Ni
Kaeru'' (Carmen Comes Home) in 1951 and ``Narayama-Bushi Ko'' (The
Ballad of Narayama) in 1958
	   According to critics, a hallmark of Kinoshita's work was his
fondness for long, panoramic shots that offer the viewer a feel for
the setting of his films.
	   For a time, Kinoshita directed dramas for television, but
returned to making films in 1976 with ``Shodo Satsujin, Musukoyo''
(Impulse Murder, My Son).
	   He was awarded the Order of the Rising Sun, Gold Rays with
Rosette from the Japanese government in 1984 for his contributions
to the film industry.
	   Kinoshita is survived by three adopted sons. A funeral service
was planned for Jan. 8 at Tokyo's Tsukiji Honganji Buddhist Temple.

Inquiries to follow Australian race disaster
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Two inquiries will be held into the
deadly Sydney-to-Hobart yacht race amid claims that race organizers
knew of the potential danger 24 hours before the fleet was
decimated by a massive storm.
	   Four bodies were recovered and rescuers have given up hope of
finding two others presumed drowned in the worst death toll in the
54-year history of the event. Winds up to 90 mph (144 kph) and
waves 35 feet (11 meters) high carved a path of destruction through
the annual race this week.
	   A New South Wales government Coroner's inquiry has been ordered
to probe the loss of life while the Cruising Yacht Club of
Australia, the race organizer, will also investigate the disaster.
	   The club defended its decision to appoint immediate past
commodore Peter Bush to hold the inquiry, saying no independent
body could do as good a job.
	   The inquiries are certain to focus on the weather and what
information was passed on to the crew aboard the 115 yachts.
Seventy yachts had withdrawn from a race wrecked by the massive
waves and rescuers saved about 50 sailors from seven stricken
craft.
	   The Sydney Morning Herald newspaper Wednesday quoted an unnamed
source from the weather bureau as saying the yacht club and the
Australian Maritime Safety Authority were given early notice of the
approaching storm.
	   ``We gave them 24 hours notice and that is a long lead time for
weather at sea,'' the source said. ``Most times 12 hours is
considered to be satisfactory.''
	   The source said the information was passed on two hours after
the start of the race at Sydney Harbor on Dec. 26. The paper said
the weather bureau was concerned by reports that the fleet was
given no warning about the intensity of the storms.
	   Richard Winning, who captained the yacht Winston Churchill which
sank, killing three, admitted he had been told that conditions
would be bad.
	   ``I think we were given adequate information, yes,'' Winning
said.
	   Bush defended the yacht club holding its own inquiry, which will
be conducted in private with the report made public later.
	   ``I don't think by any stretch of the imagination that you want
to assume that this is not going to be an objective review,'' Bush
said Wednesday.
	   ``The single most important aspect all the way along in this
process, in the history of this race, is to make sure that we make
this event and all our yacht racing as safe as humanly possible.''
	   He said the inquiry would consider whether or not the race, won
by United States maxi Sayonara, should have been abandoned when the
storm hit.
	   ``We'll certainly look at that, but it's a very very difficult
thing under all circumstances to say look, the race should have
been called off,'' Bush said.
	   ``Had we called the race off when we were aware of the strength
of those conditions, little else could have happened other than
what happened because these guys were already on the race course.
	   ``And for us to say, `OK guys all stop racing and go home,'
they're still out there, they've still got 100 or 30 or 50 miles
(160 or 48 or 80 kilometers) to get to shore and it's not actually
as simple as that.''
	   Current club commodore Hugo van Kretschmar said the inquiry
would seek input from the weather bureau and the Maritime
Authority.
	   Van Kretschmar said he had opposed an abandonment of the race
because of the conditions and said it was run under international
rules leaving the responsibility with the individual skippers.
	   ``The unsinkable and unrollable yacht, like the Titanic, doesn't
exist,'' Van Kretschmar said.
	   The bodies of two members of the Winston Churchill, Jim Lawler
and Michael Bannister, were recovered from Bass Strait on Tuesday.
Two others, Bruce Guy and Phil Skeggs from Business Post Naiad,
were killed when their yacht rolled over Sunday during the peak of
the storms.
	   British Olympic Games sailor Glyn Charles, 33, and Australian
John Dean, 47, are presumed dead.
	   The Maritime Authority abandoned its search Tuesday afternoon,
saying that was an indication no hope was held for the pair.
	   Dean had told his family that when he died he wanted his ashes
spread at sea.
	   ``It looks like he has got his wish. At least he died doing
something he loved,'' said Dean's 15-year-old son Peter.
	   The crew on fifth-placed Nokia held a minute's silence when it
arrived in Hobart late Tuesday.
	   Skipper David Witt said Charles, swept off the deck of Sword of
Orion, had first considered sailing on Nokia.
	   ``At one stage I had 16 crew washed off the windward side by one
huge wave,'' Witt said. ``After that everyone but a vital six
remained on deck.''

	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Two inquiries will be held into the
deadly Sydney-to-Hobart yacht race amid claims that race organizers
knew of the potential danger 24 hours before the fleet was
decimated by a massive storm.
	   Four bodies were recovered and rescuers have given up hope of
finding two others presumed drowned in the worst death toll in the
54-year history of the event. Winds up to 90 mph (144 kph) and
waves 35 feet (11 meters) high carved a path of destruction through
the annual race this week.
	   A New South Wales government Coroner's inquiry has been ordered
to probe the loss of life while the Cruising Yacht Club of
Australia, the race organizer, will also investigate the disaster.
	   The club defended its decision to appoint immediate past
commodore Peter Bush to hold the inquiry, saying no independent
body could do as good a job.
	   The inquiries are certain to focus on the weather and what
information was passed on to the crew aboard the 115 yachts.
Seventy yachts had withdrawn from a race wrecked by the massive
waves and rescuers saved about 50 sailors from seven stricken
craft.
	   The Sydney Morning Herald newspaper Wednesday quoted an unnamed
source from the weather bureau as saying the yacht club and the
Australian Maritime Safety Authority were given early notice of the
approaching storm.
	   ``We gave them 24 hours notice and that is a long lead time for
weather at sea,'' the source said. ``Most times 12 hours is
considered to be satisfactory.''
	   The source said the information was passed on two hours after
the start of the race at Sydney Harbor on Dec. 26. The paper said
the weather bureau was concerned by reports that the fleet was
given no warning about the intensity of the storms.
	   Richard Winning, who captained the yacht Winston Churchill which
sank, killing three, admitted he had been told that conditions
would be bad.
	   ``I think we were given adequate information, yes,'' Winning
said.
	   Bush defended the yacht club holding its own inquiry, which will
be conducted in private with the report made public later.
	   ``I don't think by any stretch of the imagination that you want
to assume that this is not going to be an objective review,'' Bush
said Wednesday.
	   ``The single most important aspect all the way along in this
process, in the history of this race, is to make sure that we make
this event and all our yacht racing as safe as humanly possible.''
	   He said the inquiry would consider whether or not the race, won
by United States maxi Sayonara, should have been abandoned when the
storm hit.
	   ``We'll certainly look at that, but it's a very very difficult
thing under all circumstances to say look, the race should have
been called off,'' Bush said.
	   ``Had we called the race off when we were aware of the strength
of those conditions, little else could have happened other than
what happened because these guys were already on the race course.
	   ``And for us to say, `OK guys all stop racing and go home,'
they're still out there, they've still got 100 or 30 or 50 miles
(160 or 48 or 80 kilometers) to get to shore and it's not actually
as simple as that.''
	   Current club commodore Hugo van Kretschmar said the inquiry
would seek input from the weather bureau and the Maritime
Authority.
	   Van Kretschmar said he had opposed an abandonment of the race
because of the conditions and said it was run under international
rules leaving the responsibility with the individual skippers.
	   ``The unsinkable and unrollable yacht, like the Titanic, doesn't
exist,'' Van Kretschmar said.
	   The bodies of two members of the Winston Churchill, Jim Lawler
and Michael Bannister, were recovered from Bass Strait on Tuesday.
Two others, Bruce Guy and Phil Skeggs from Business Post Naiad,

	   The Maritime Authority abandoned its search Tuesday afternoon,

	   Dean had told his family that when he died he wanted his ashes
spread at sea.
	   ``It looks like he has got his wish. At least he died doing
something he loved,'' said Dean's 15-year-old son Peter.

Thai pier owner, employee avoid prison over deadly accident
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ The owner and an employee of a company
that ran a Bangkok pier which capsized in 1995 killing 29 people
have received suspended jail terms, local papers reported
Wednesday.
	   A criminal court said that Suphaphan Phichaironarongsongkhram,
joint owner of the Suphathra Co., which owned the pier, and an
employee, Karuna Thepklang, had dismantled a gate which was used to
control the number of people streaming onto the pier.
	   They were given one year jail terms, which were suspended. The
company was fined 20,000 baht (dlrs 555), the Nation newspaper
reported.
	   In handing out the sentences, the court said that the two women,
by paying compensation to the families of the 29 killed, had
performed an act of atonement.
	   Three Harbor Department officials responsible for overseeing
piers on the Chao Phraya River in Bangkok, were acquitted of
negligence charges, The Nation said.
	   The floating pier, used by commuters to catch express boats on
the Chao Phraya, the main waterway in Bangkok, capsized on June 14,
1995 after too many people crammed toward its front.
	   The pier's capacity was 60 people. In addition to the 29 who
drowned, more than 100 were injured, including one who was
paralyzed. Many of the victims were school children.

Reports: Villagers kill seven soldiers in northwest Indonesia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ A mob of 200 villagers, some armed
with machetes, tortured and killed seven Indonesian soldiers after
stopping their car in a northwestern province, local media reported
Wednesday.
	   The Tuesday incident in Aceh province was likely to raise
tensions in a region where the Indonesian military recently ended a
decade-long campaign against separatist rebels. Officials suspect
guerrillas were behind the attack.
	   Accused of widespread atrocities in Aceh, the military
apologized and withdrew some troops in a conciliatory gesture after
the resignation in May of former President Suharto. But resentment
toward the armed forces remains deep.
	   Some soldiers managed to escape their attackers in the village
of Lhok Nibung and reported to their superiors, the official Antara
news agency quoted army spokesman Maj. Gen. Syamsul Ma'arif as
saying.
	   Some 200 troops were dispatched to search for the killers, but
there were no reported arrests. The bodies of those slain, who had
been going on leave to the nearby city of Medan, were not found.
	   Aceh, about 1,750 kilometers (1,100 miles) northwest of Jakarta,
is a staunchly Muslim province where rebels have been fighting for
an Islamic state for decades.
	   The military has acknowledged that 760 people died in fighting
since the late 1980s, although human rights groups put the death
toll higher. Mass graves have been uncovered and some widows have
alleged they were raped by soldiers.
	   Col. Johny Wahab, a military commander in Aceh, said the attack
on Tuesday indicated that appeals to the local community to ensure
security in the region had been in vain.
	   ``Good intentions have been responded to inhumanly with the
abduction and torture of servicemen who were about to go on
leave,'' he said.

Four Westerners killed in bloody end to Yemen kidnapping
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SAN`A, Yemen (AP) _ Troops surrounded a band of Islamic
extremists holding 16 Western tourists hostage and opened fire,
bringing a bloody end to the kidnapping that left four Westerners
dead and two others injured.
	   The remaining 10 hostages were freed unharmed following
Tuesday's military operation, in which three kidnappers died.
	   Yemen's Interior Ministry said the kidnappers had killed three
of the captives and that a fourth died later in hospital.
	   It was not immediately clear if the victims were slain before or
during the fighting between extremists and some 200 Yemen security
forces.
	   U.S. State Department spokesman Lee McClenny said that according
to the Yemen government, troops stormed the hideout only after the
kidnappers began killing the hostages.
	   The 16 tourists _ 12 Britons, two Americans and two Australians
_ were kidnapped Monday near the southern town of Mawdiyah, about
175 miles (280 kms) south of the capital, San`a.
	   In London, the Foreign Office confirmed that three Britons _
Ruth Williamson, Margaret Whitehouse and Peter Rowe _ were killed,
but did not provide their ages or hometowns.
	   The nationality of the fourth victim was unclear. Yemen's
Interior Ministry said all those killed were British, but the
United States and Britain both said an Australian was among the
dead. The other tourists injured in the clash were an American
woman and a British woman.
	   Three of the kidnappers, including an Egyptian, were killed, the
Interior Ministry said. It was not immediately known if there were
any other kidnappers and whether they had been apprehended.
	   The surviving hostages were recovering from their ordeal at a
hotel in Aden, where volunteers from the British and American
communities were helping them cope with their trauma, said David
Pearce, a British Embassy official in San`a.
	   ``They are obviously in a state of severe shock, and I mean
severe shock,'' Pearce told the British news agency Press
Association. ''They are uninjured but obviously very tired, very
stunned and in need of a good meal, a good rest and someone to talk
to. They have been through an awful experience.''
	   In London, British newspapers on Wednesday criticized the
bungled rescue attempt. The Daily Mail, a London-based tabloid,
asked on the front page, ``Did your tourists really need to die?''
	   The kidnapping began Monday when the tourists' convoy of five
vehicles was ambushed by men who opened fire on their police
escorts. The kidnappers threatened to kill the tourists if the
police did not back off, Yemeni security officials said.
	   Tribesmen in unruly Yemen have frequently kidnapped tourists to
pressure the government into providing them with new roads, water
or clinics. But the hostages generally have been treated as guests
and released unharmed.
	   Four Germans are being held by a tribe in northeast Yemen. The
kidnappers are demanding more schools, hospitals and telephone
lines in their area.
	   The latest incident marked the first time an abduction was
carried out by Islamic extremists. Security officials said the
kidnappers belong to Islamic Jihad, many of whose leaders fought
Russian troops in Afghanistan. The group is believed to have about
200 members.
	   The Interior Ministry said members of the ``extremist terrorist
gang'' killed three of the captives _ two men and a woman.
	   ``They proceeded in killing the captives after refusing any
attempts at negotiations, which led security forces to storm the
area to prevent further bloodshed and ensure the safe release of
the rest of the hostages,'' the statement said.
	   The bodies of the dead and injured tourists were ferried by
government helicopter to a hospital in the southern port city of
Aden, security officials said. The other tourists were escorted by
troops to a hotel in Aden.
	   After the shootout, security forces detained scores of suspected
Islamic extremists, said the officials, who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
	   The kidnappers had demanded the release of their leader, Saleh
Haidara al-Atwi, who was detained two weeks ago as part of a
government crackdown on Islamic vigilantes who had been enforcing
strict Islamic rules in southern Yemen, security officials said.
	   Islamic Jihad members reportedly were flogging women who did not
observe the Islamic dress code and men for selling and drinking
alcohol, which is forbidden in Islam.
	   The kidnappers also wanted the release of another leader, the
officials said. They did not identify him.
	   The group ran a military camp in southern Yemen, security
officials said.
	   Yemen was once a haven for Islamic militant fugitives from other
countries, but the government has expelled many of them.
	   Before the shootout, Yemeni officials tried to negotiate with
the kidnappers while security forces encircled the area.
	   Ahmad Ali Mohsen, governor of Abyan province, where the
kidnapping took place, was leading the talks with leaders of the
Al-Fadl tribe, to which the kidnappers belong, an official at the
governor's office said.
	   A London-based Islamic human rights group said Tuesday that it
had contacted the kidnappers the night before and received
assurances that they would not harm the hostages.
	   ``They promised not to harm the hostages,'' said a spokesman for
the Islamic Observation Center. ``We hold the Yemeni government
responsible for the deaths. The way the authorities handled the
situation was barbaric and irresponsible.''

Government reveals corruption losses tied to Suharto associates
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: One name correct for Hartarto &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Corrupt business practices, largely by
the family and associates of former President Suharto, cost the
state as much as dlrs 580 million over the last five years, the
Indonesian government has concluded.
	   Authorities have been investigating evidence of corruption
during the long rule of Suharto, who was ousted in May after riots
by Indonesia's poor and student protests against his 32-year rule.
	   The new report on corruption, released Tuesday, could bolster an
investigation of the origin of Suharto's wealth even though critics
have dismissed the probe as cosmetic. Suharto has denied any
wrongdoing.
	   The government has also terminated dozens of investment projects
tainted by collusion and nepotism, said Hartarto, the chief Cabinet
minister for development and administrative reform.
	   Hartarto said the state expected to recover dlrs 43 million of
the money lost because of corruption in contracts and government
agencies between 1993 and September 1998.
	   Suharto's credibility was eroded in part by allegations of
official graft at a time when Indonesia's economy was buckling
under the worst financial crisis in decades. Millions of people
have lost their jobs and inflation has soared.
	   President B.J. Habibie ordered an investigation of his
predecessor and onetime mentor after coming under pressure from
student protesters who want 77-year-old Suharto to be put on trial.
	   Government opponents question whether Habibie, who owes his
position to Suharto and whose family also owns dozens of
businesses, is conducting a serious probe.
	   On Tuesday, prosecutors questioned one of Suharto's three sons,
businessman Bambang Trihatmodjo, about his role as head of one of
seven charitable foundations once owned by the former president.
	   The foundations were allegedly used in part to collect money
that Suharto's family used for its own benefit. After questioning,
Bambang said the foundation provided funds ``for social needs.''

Pitches and test schedules blamed for poor record
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With BC-Sports-Cricket-New Zealand-India
 &UR; By IHITHISHAM KAMARDEEN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) _ Batsmen-friendly pitches at home
and infrequent test schedules may be responsible for India's
threadbare track record outside the subcontinent, observers said
Wednesday.
	   In the second cricket test against New Zealand this week, India
found itself in familiar territory, losing a one-time lead in the
match to be beaten by an inexperienced Kiwi side.
	   While it has won 18 of its last 31 tests at home, India hasn't
won a test overseas since beating Sri Lanka in July, 1993, in
Colombo 18 matches ago.
	   ``The real problem is the batsmen-friendly wickets,'' said Ayaz
Memon, a senior cricket writer and editor of Bombay based Mid-day
newspaper.
	   ``We get a completely false idea of our strength and when you
encounter pitches that do a little bit we are badly exposed,'' he
said.
	   Memon said the at-home wins came easily in conditions good for
spin bowling. This was the case when India thrashed Australia 2-1
early this year.
	   He said Indian cricketers weren't mentally prepared for overseas
tests and suffer from short attention spans. This was reflected in
the seven dropped catches that let New Zealand slip away.
	   India's last win outside the subcontinent was a 2-0 success over
England in 1986. The team then lost a one-off test to Zimbabwe in
Harare in October.
	   The Indians played just four tests before the current series
compared to the 40 one-day internationals when it won five
championship finals.
	   ``We play so many one-day games these days, it is very difficult
to suddenly change in test matches,'' skipper Mohammed Azharuddin
said.
	   ``We should play both in equal proportions.
	   ``It has been said in the past but nothing has was done.
	   ``People are more concerned about making money than doing what
is right by the game and for the improvement of it,'' he said.
	   India has lost recent series in the West Indies, South Africa
and Zimbabwe.
	   Azharuddin said it was sad, but that he hoped the teams
prospects would improve.
	   ``We don't go overseas with the intention of losing,'' he said.
	   ``From country to country we encounter different conditions and
by the time you get a feel for it, the series is lost,'' he said.
	   Azharuddin said a test championship was a good idea but should
be thoroughly examined before the final decision is made.

Government: Chinese economy grew by 7.8 percent in 1998
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Boosted by massive state spending on public
works, China's economy grew by 7.8 percent this year but missed its
official target, according to figures released Wednesday.
	   Growth was down sharply from 1997, when the economy expanded by
8.8 percent. Chinese leaders had hoped for at least 8 percent this
year to create jobs for millions of workers laid off in a sweeping
overhaul of state companies.
	   China has escaped the full impact of the 18-month-old Asian
financial crisis, but faces serious problems of its own in trying
to turn around money-losing state industries and clean up its
state-owned banking system.
	   The Chinese economy has slowed considerably since the early
1990s, when it was growing by double digits. But it still is doing
better than its neighbors, some of which are recording negative
growth. Indonesia says its economy could shrink by up to 15 percent
this year.
	   In a positive sign, the Chinese growth rate began to rise in
recent months, pumped up by the start of a dlrs 1.4 trillion,
three-year stimulus plan of spending on new highways and other
projects, according to the State Statistical Bureau.
	   Exports were almost unchanged from 1997 at dlrs 182 billion,
while imports fell 3.8 percent to dlrs 137 billion. That left China
with a trade surplus of dlrs 45 billion, up dlrs 4.7 billion from
the previous year.
	   Ye Zhen, a spokesman for the Statistical Bureau, declined at a
press conference to give a growth forecast for 1999. He said it
would be released by the National People's Congress early next
year.
	   The economy expanded by only 7 percent in the first half of
1998. That prompted Chinese leaders to implement the stimulus plan
and increase lending by state banks, loosening austerity measures
that date to the early 1990s.
	   Those austerity measures, imposed to fight inflation that at the
time was raging at more than 20 percent a year, have been so
effective at cooling the Chinese economy that consumer prices are
actually falling.
	   Spurred by the increased spending, the economy grew by 9 percent
in the fourth quarter of the year, according to an estimate by the
Statistical Bureau.
	   Real utilized foreign investment for the year fell 16 percent to
dlrs 54 billion, according to the government figures.
	   Ye blamed the decline on the Asian financial crisis, which has
hurt Japan, South Korea and other key investors.
	   Foreign companies also have become more reluctant to invest in
China because of dissatisfaction with low profits.

King won't approve amnesty for Khmer Rouge leaders

	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ King Norodom Sihanouk refused
Wednesday to approve amnesty for two leaders of the genocidal Khmer
Rouge regime, setting up a collision course with his prime
minister, who has pledged to shield them from trial.
	   The refusal casts doubt on the legitimacy of the deal Prime
Minister Hun Sen has granted the two Khmer Rouge, Khieu Samphan and
Nuon Chea, to defect to the government in exchange for assurances
they will not be tried for crimes against humanity.
	   ``Taking into account the very wide and undeniable discontent of
the majority of the Khmer people, I announce to this majority that
I respect them and will not renew my power of amnesty for major
Khmer Rouge criminals, who are anti-Cambodian people,'' the king
said.
	   Sihanouk, 76, who is receiving medical treatment for a range of
ailments in Beijing, made the comments in his palace bulletin,
which was faxed to news organizations.

	   Sihanouk said that an international tribunal would have ``the
perfect right to take up the case of genocide in Cambodia, because
it concerns crimes against humanity.''
	   ``That concerns the conscience of the community of all the
world's people's,'' the king said.
	   Khieu Samphan and Nuon Chea, both members of the inner circle of
the late Khmer Rouge leader Pol Pot, spent their second day in
Phnom Penh after being greeted by Hun Sen with smiles Tuesday and
assured they would not stand trial.
	   They told a heated news conference afterward that they were
``very sorry'' for the deaths of as many as 2 million Cambodians
under the Khmer Rouge reign of terror between 1975 and 1979 but
refused to accept personal responsibility.
	   The pair and Hun Sen said separately that the past was history
and that pursuing Khmer Rouge leaders for prosecution would simply
lead to a renewal of civil war.
	   Khieu Samphan said repeatedly: ``Let bygones be bygones.''
