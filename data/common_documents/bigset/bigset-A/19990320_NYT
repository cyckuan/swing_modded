WITNESS'   STORY SHIFTS WITH LANGUAGE, CRASH INVESTIGATORS SAY
</HEADLINE>
  
 (SUBS to add list of victims to end of original text.)  
 (ATTN: Ill., Miss., Wash., Japan)   (rk) 
 By   BILL DEDMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ As they wound down their investigation at the scene of
Monday's deadly crash of an Amtrak train and a truck loaded with
steel, federal investigators said Friday that a language barrier
might have caused them to misunderstand the description of the
accident by their first witness.
</P>
<P>
   They now understand the witness to have said that he did not see
the truck drive around a crossing gate before it was struck by the
train.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, federal investigators told reporters that the
witness had said he had seen the truck zigzag around the gates, but
Friday the investigators said the witness was saying that he did
not see the truck go around the gate.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators said the Spanish-speaking witness might not have
changed his story, but might just have been misunderstood.
</P>
<P>
   Eleven people were killed, and 116 injured, in the accident at a
crossing near Bourbonnais, Ill., about 50 miles south of Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   No federal official would explain publicly what caused the
confusion. The National Transportation Safety Board issued only a
brief written statement, saying that ``any characterization of
witness statements up to this point would be one person's
interpretation and not the position of the safety board.''
</P>
<P>
   Federal investigators say they have ``a number of people'' who
have said they saw the accident.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking on the condition of anonymity, safety board
investigators said the first witness, a Spanish-speaking restaurant
worker from Chicago, called Amtrak on Wednesday night, saying he
had been two cars behind the truck. In an initial interview, with
questions and answers in English, the investigators understood the
man to say that he saw the truck drive around a crossing gate.
</P>
<P>
   In a later, formal interview on Thursday evening, with questions
and answers translated by a state police officer, investigators
understood the man to say that he did not see the truck drive
around the gates. ``He said it the first time, and not the second
time,'' one investigator said.
</P>
<P>
   The man said he did not know whether the truck went through
flashing lights, which are designed to begin seconds before the
gates come down, and about 25 to 30 seconds before the train
arrives.
</P>
<P>
   The witness said he was in the area because he got lost looking
for an automobile dealer.
</P>
<P>
   The truck driver, John R. Stokes, 58, of Manteno, Ill., has said
he did not drive around the gates and did not see the warning
lights until just before impact. His driving record since 1968,
released Friday by the state, shows nine accidents, six license
suspensions, two tickets for driving with a suspended license, and
two tickets for driving without insurance.
</P>
<P>
   He was driving on Monday with a probationary permit. The state's
attorney has begun a criminal investigation.
</P>
<P>
   The engineer of the train has not been interviewed because he
remains sedated.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever those potential witnesses have to say, investigators
said that they rely much more heavily on physical evidence. So far,
the physical evidence suggests that the truck driver zigzagged
around the gates, perhaps because he could not see a train coming.
</P>
<P>
   The evidence cited by investigators: The tips of the crossing
gates are damaged. Damage on the locomotive suggests that the truck
and train were not at right angles. Tire trucks in the mud suggest
that someone drove around the gates, but have yet to be matched to
the truck involved in the accident.
</P>
<P>
   The Kankakee County coroner identified the 11 victims on Friday:
</P>
<P>
   June Bonnin, 46, Nesbit, Miss.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Merrill Lynch financial consultant Kirsten Bratti needs a firm
grasp on the minds and moods of her clients if she's going to aptly
manage their life savings. But she felt she wasn't getting quite
far enough.
</P>
<P>
   So last summer Bratti, who works in San Mateo, Calif., decided
to break the grass ceiling. She took a seminar called Golf 101,
which teaches not the techniques of golf but how to do business on
the course.
</P>
<P>
   Soon afterward, she invited a $400,000 client to play _ and
everything changed. ``Every time we got together, she would bring
up other things in her life and say how fantastic it was that she
was really getting to know me,'' says Bratti. Within a few months,
the client asked Bratti to manage all her assets: $3 million.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to doing business on the golf course, it doesn't
matter how well you play the game, as long as you can play the
game. And that's what seminars on business golf teach: how to
develop a relationship with a client between swings, when and how
to talk business, and how not to screw up a transaction with golf
faux pas.
</P>
<P>
   There's no denying that deals are done on the golf course. A
Hyatt survey shows that 93 percent of executives who play golf
agree it's a good way to tighten links with a business associate.
In fact, 35 percent have clinched some of their biggest deals on
the golf course.
</P>
<P>
   Chances are, you won't actually sign your contract on the
fairway. Course time is dedicated to developing the relationship,
to creating shared moments that you can reminisce about later, and
to culling clues about what your client values.
</P>
<P>
   If you feel compelled to talk numbers, don't bring it up until
the middle third of the round, says Dan C. Weilbaker, who teaches a
business golf seminar at Northern Illinois University in DeKalb,
Ill., and organizes an annual golf outing in which his students
practice with executives.
</P>
<P>
   In case the client brings up business, have a few short points
prepared, says Sue Wietzman, a former financial analyst who now
teaches business golf. ``You might only have 20 or 30 seconds
before somebody needs to shoot, so don't have a ten-minute test,''
she days. ``Have five soundbites that you can drop in.''
</P>
<P>
   Experienced golfers don't care about your skill level, as long
as you don't slow down play. But they do care that you know the
rules and etiquette of the game. Not knowing how to tend the pin
when your client is putting, for example, could turn her birdie
into a bogey and her into an enemy.
</P>
<P>
   Remember: If she's putting from the green, you ask whether she
wants the flagstick in or out of the hole. (If she wants the flag
in, you pull it out after she putts but before the ball reaches the
hole.)
</P>
<P>
   If you're not as skilled as the other person, be good-natured
about it, says Peter Titlebaum, as assistant professor of sport
management at the University of Dayton and a teacher of
business-golf seminars.
</P>
<P>
   Don't keep apologizing, and don't blame inanimate objects. If
none of you plays well, consider inviting the clients for a golf
lesson instead of a round, says Weitzman.
</P>
<P>
   If you're much better than your client or boss, don't throw the
game. It could destroy your credibility. At the same time, suspend
your ego.
</P>
<P>
   ``This game is not about you,'' says Will D. Rhame, who runs
BusinessLinks International in Tampa, Fla. ``It's about the person
you invited. Don't focus on trying to impress somebody with your
playing ability. Focus on being the best host.''
</P>
<P>
   And keep your golf tips to yourself, says Weitzman. Keep the
emphasis on fun, rather than competition. Rhame recommends agreeing
in advance to be lax: Mulligans are okay. Picking up the ball if
you're overmatched on a hole is okay.
</P>
<P>
   Half the people in the Hyatt survey agree that the way a person
plays golf is a reflection of the way he does business.
</P>
<P>
   ``If someone's willing to cheat on the golf course, they're
probably willing to cheat in a business deal,'' says Titlebaum.
``If they throw clubs and swear, it may tell me they don't have as
much control as I would like for people I want to be associated
with.'' &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM _ 75 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 750) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Keep an eye out for other clues. Bratti noticed that one
particular client liked to mull things over before making a
decision. ``She took quite a while before lining herself up and
hitting the ball,'' she says. Bratti now uses that knowledge when
doing business with her: ``Before something needs to be done, I put
it in writing and give her enough time to think about it,'' Bratti
says. Some of her other clients prefer to wing it or have decisions
made for them. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Scope out the course beforehand, says Ilene Sokoloff, who used
to run a business-golf seminar and now writes about golf. If you
don't know soft spikes are required, you could end up having to buy
your client and yourself new shoes _ and you'll look unprepared.
</P>
<P>
   If you bring a female client to play during men-only hours, or
vice versa, you'll embarrass everyone.
</P>
<P>
   Get to know course employees so you're treated like a regular in
front of your client, adds Rhame, who's the co-author along with
James A. McNulty of ``Pat Summerall's Business Golf: The Art of
Developing Relationships Through Golf'' (Birch Lane Press, 1999).
</P>
<P>
   On game day, says Rhame, arrive early. Have your golf bag put on
the driver's side, especially if you're a woman, says Sokoloff. It
creates equal footing. Greet the client as he drives in. Pay in

waiting, ideally a golf shirt with your company logo.

buy her three _ buy her a dozen. Pay for the cart, too. Exception:
If the client wants to walk, you walk.

   Establish the format in advance. One of the most conducive for
business is best ball, with two-person teams. After you both tee
off, each of you plays from the spot where the better drive landed
and so forth for the rest of the hole. That makes you and your

<TEXT>
<P>
   Merrill Lynch financial consultant Kirsten Bratti needs a firm
grasp on the minds and moods of her clients if she's going to aptly
manage their life savings. But she felt she wasn't getting quite
far enough.
</P>
<P>
   So last summer Bratti, who works in San Mateo, Calif., decided
to break the grass ceiling. She took a seminar called Golf 101,
which teaches not the techniques of golf but how to do business on
the course.
</P>
<P>
   Soon afterward, she invited a $400,000 client to play _ and
everything changed. ``Every time we got together, she would bring
up other things in her life and say how fantastic it was that she
was really getting to know me,'' says Bratti. Within a few months,
the client asked Bratti to manage all her assets: $3 million.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to doing business on the golf course, it doesn't
matter how well you play the game, as long as you can play the
game. And that's what seminars on business golf teach: how to
develop a relationship with a client between swings, when and how
to talk business, and how not to screw up a transaction with golf
faux pas.
</P>
<P>
   There's no denying that deals are done on the golf course. A
Hyatt survey shows that 93 percent of executives who play golf
agree it's a good way to tighten links with a business associate.
In fact, 35 percent have clinched some of their biggest deals on
the golf course.
</P>
<P>
   Chances are, you won't actually sign your contract on the
fairway. Course time is dedicated to developing the relationship,
to creating shared moments that you can reminisce about later, and
to culling clues about what your client values.
</P>
<P>
   If you feel compelled to talk numbers, don't bring it up until
the middle third of the round, says Dan C. Weilbaker, who teaches a
business golf seminar at Northern Illinois University in DeKalb,
Ill., and organizes an annual golf outing in which his students
practice with executives.
</P>
<P>
   In case the client brings up business, have a few short points
prepared, says Sue Wietzman, a former financial analyst who now
teaches business golf. ``You might only have 20 or 30 seconds
before somebody needs to shoot, so don't have a ten-minute test,''
she days. ``Have five soundbites that you can drop in.''
</P>
<P>
   Experienced golfers don't care about your skill level, as long
as you don't slow down play. But they do care that you know the
rules and etiquette of the game. Not knowing how to tend the pin
when your client is putting, for example, could turn her birdie
into a bogey and her into an enemy.
</P>
<P>
   Remember: If she's putting from the green, you ask whether she
wants the flagstick in or out of the hole. (If she wants the flag
in, you pull it out after she putts but before the ball reaches the
hole.)
</P>
<P>
   If you're not as skilled as the other person, be good-natured
about it, says Peter Titlebaum, as assistant professor of sport
management at the University of Dayton and a teacher of
business-golf seminars.
</P>
<P>
   Don't keep apologizing, and don't blame inanimate objects. If
none of you plays well, consider inviting the clients for a golf
lesson instead of a round, says Weitzman.
</P>
<P>
   If you're much better than your client or boss, don't throw the
game. It could destroy your credibility. At the same time, suspend
your ego.
</P>
<P>
   ``This game is not about you,'' says Will D. Rhame, who runs
BusinessLinks International in Tampa, Fla. ``It's about the person
you invited. Don't focus on trying to impress somebody with your
playing ability. Focus on being the best host.''
</P>
<P>
   And keep your golf tips to yourself, says Weitzman. Keep the
emphasis on fun, rather than competition. Rhame recommends agreeing
in advance to be lax: Mulligans are okay. Picking up the ball if
you're overmatched on a hole is okay.
</P>
<P>
   Half the people in the Hyatt survey agree that the way a person
plays golf is a reflection of the way he does business.
</P>
<P>
   ``If someone's willing to cheat on the golf course, they're
probably willing to cheat in a business deal,'' says Titlebaum.
``If they throw clubs and swear, it may tell me they don't have as
much control as I would like for people I want to be associated
with.'' &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM _ 75 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 750) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Keep an eye out for other clues. Bratti noticed that one
particular client liked to mull things over before making a
decision. ``She took quite a while before lining herself up and
hitting the ball,'' she says. Bratti now uses that knowledge when
doing business with her: ``Before something needs to be done, I put
it in writing and give her enough time to think about it,'' Bratti
says. Some of her other clients prefer to wing it or have decisions
made for them. &QL;

   Scope out the course beforehand, says Ilene Sokoloff, who used
to run a business-golf seminar and now writes about golf. If you
don't know soft spikes are required, you could end up having to buy
your client and yourself new shoes _ and you'll look unprepared.
</P>
<P>
   If you bring a female client to play during men-only hours, or
vice versa, you'll embarrass everyone.
</P>
<P>
   Get to know course employees so you're treated like a regular in
front of your client, adds Rhame, who's the co-author along with
James A. McNulty of ``Pat Summerall's Business Golf: The Art of
Developing Relationships Through Golf'' (Birch Lane Press, 1999).
</P>
<P>

front of your client, adds Rhame, who's the co-author along with
James A. McNulty of ``Pat Summerall's Business Golf: The Art of
Developing Relationships Through Golf'' (Birch Lane Press, 1999).
</P>
<P>
   On game day, says Rhame, arrive early. Have your golf bag put on
the driver's side, especially if you're a woman, says Sokoloff. It
creates equal footing. Greet the client as he drives in. Pay in
advance so the client understands he's your guest. Have a gift
waiting, ideally a golf shirt with your company logo.
</P>
<P>
   Don't scrimp on anything. If the client needs golf balls, don't
buy her three _ buy her a dozen. Pay for the cart, too. Exception:
If the client wants to walk, you walk.
</P>
<P>
   Make it a foursome. Invite two other people who will interest or
be of help to your client and who will help keep the conversation
moving, says Rhame. Or let the client bring someone, says Bill
Storer, who runs Business Golf Strategies in Basking Ridge, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   Sal Pulitano, CEO of Computing Concepts, a computer integrating
company, played with a client who was a purchasing agent, and the
client brought his father, who was a purchasing agent for another
company. ``We picked up another account,'' says Pulitano, who pays
for his employees to attend Storer's seminars.
</P>
<P>
   Establish the format in advance. One of the most conducive for
business is best ball, with two-person teams. After you both tee
off, each of you plays from the spot where the better drive landed
and so forth for the rest of the hole. That makes you and your
client a team, calling each other partner and working off each
other's success, says Rhame. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (SECOND OPTIONAL TRIM _ 225 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 1200) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Remember _ during the game, you're being watched as closely as
you are watching. Storer tells the recent story of a salesman who
made the mistake of drinking during a round and tipped the cart on
a sharp turn. His client fell out and was knocked unconscious.
After recovering, the client didn't stick around to do more
business. The salesman was fired.
</P>
<P>
   Suzanne Woo, who runs Golf 101, encourages women to play off the
middle tees, where men usually start, instead of the forward tees,
which used to be called the ladies' tees but are now less
chauvinistically referred to as the beginners' tees.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're out there trying to build a relationship, you don't
want to be coming in and out of the conversation,'' she says. If
the more difficult drive holds a woman's game back, she should tell
the other players she'll move her ball from where it lands to where
theirs land, to keep the game moving.
</P>
<P>
   If you're playing with someone who plays from the forward tees,
don't sit in the cart and wait for her to tee off, says Rhame.
``Give her the courtesy to get out of the cart, and go stand with
her like she stood with you.'' &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF SECOND OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, send a thank-you note, maybe even an article about an
interest that your client casually mentioned. Follow up with a
phone call to set up an appointment to do business.
</P>
<P>
   ``People take my calls more frequently after we've played a
round of golf,'' says Dave Lakhani, director of sales at Cougar
Mountain Software in Boise, Idaho. And that's what it's all about. &QL;

<P>
   We, a nation of TV enthusiasts, have placed our faith in the
idea of the little black set-top box, an accoutrement that, as a
cable box, turned out feeble network options into a viewing
Shangri-la.
</P>
<P>
   Taking a cue from TV, some Internet providers soon spawned the
notion of content personalization through ``channels.'' Then came
the idea that we could reap television-like enjoyment from
``viewing'' these Internet channels on our TV. When we signed on,
we envisioned a web of TV; what we got was WebTV.
</P>
<P>
   But now we have reached convergence: ReplayTV. A step beyond
WebTV, ReplayTV has taken the personalization features of Internet
portals like Yahoo! and Excite and adapted them to what we want to
see emanating from our tubes _ namely, television programs.
</P>
<P>
   A small, sleek black box with the savvy of a PC yet commanded by
the familiar click of a remote control, ReplayTV lets us believe
again in the idea of personalized channels.
</P>
<P>
   Its Replay Channels _ tailored by show, entertainer, or theme,
be it ``The Simpsons,'' ``Jeff Gordon,'' or ``fishing'' _ act like
a set of earmarked mailboxes (you've got ``Friends''!), where
specific types of programs of your predetermined choosing are found
and recorded.
</P>
<P>
   A Yankees fan could set up a ``Yankees Channel'' and, whenever
he wanted, check for Yankees games and related programming on the
on-screen program guide. Just punch up that channel when it's time
for marathon viewing.
</P>
<P>
   There's more: Let's say that during ``Frasier'' we decide we'd
love to have a permanent record of David Hyde Pierce's future work.
Just press the ``Record This Show'' button on the Replay remote.
</P>
<P>
   The TV will ask, ``Record just this episode or record all
episodes?'' If you decide on the latter, the most recent show will
always be in the on-deck circle, ready and waiting.
</P>
<P>
   Because its hard-drive storage (anywhere from 6 to 20 hours) is
random-access, ReplayTV can record and play a show at the same
time, allowing you to pause, rewind, and fast-forward during
currently airing programs.
</P>
<P>
   Each night ReplayTV dials into the free Replay Network Services
to update itself with the latest channel-guide info.
</P>
<P>
   For now, the top-of-the-line ``enthusiast version'' is available
from Replay Networks for $995. But various manufacturers have
licensed this technology, so coming down the pike will likely be
$500 versions with an emphasis on simplicity.
</P>
<P>
   Bells and whistles are one thing, but as Replay Networks
director of marketing Jim Plant explains, the core of the issue is
always that ``the number-one problem people have is missing their
favorite television show.'' &QL;

DUCHESNE PLAYS WAITING GAME
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROGER PHILLIPS  
 c.1999 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD, Calif. _ Steve Duchesne remained in hockey limbo
Friday, a King for at least another day.
</P>
<P>
   Duchesne cleared NHL waivers, which was no surprise because if a
team had claimed him, it would have had to pay his $7.5 million
salary the next two years.
</P>
<P>
   The 33-year-old rushing defenseman indicated that waiting for a
resolution has been difficult. He might have to wait a few days
more.
</P>
<P>
   The NHL trading deadline is Tuesday and Duchesne could be dealt
by then, or could remain with the Kings if they are unable to
strike a deal. It appears the Kings would be willing to assume some
of Duchesne's contract to unload a player who has been the biggest
disappointment in a disappointing season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm kind of going day by day right now,'' Duchesne said. ``I'm
trying not to think too far ahead.''
</P>
<P>
   Duchesne's agent, Pat Brisson, said Thursday that Kings general
manager Dave Taylor spoke to him in January, expressing concerns
with Duchesne's performance. Brisson said Taylor informed him three
weeks ago that the Kings were trying to trade Duchesne.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's unfortunate things didn't work out,'' Brisson said.
``It's their decision. In my opinion, it's a little premature. But
it's their decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the teams that might be looking for a defenseman with
Duchesne's offensive skills are Carolina and Philadelphia. The
Kings play host to Florida tonight at the Forum.
</P>
<P>
   __ Loose pucks: An MRI revealed that forward Sean Pronger
suffered a torn medial collateral ligament in his left knee in a
first-period collision Thursday night. He'll be sidelined four to
six weeks. Vladimir Tsyplakov, who has missed the last month with a
knee injury, is expected to replace Pronger in the lineup.

 By BRONWYN FRYER  
 c.1999 Worth Magazine  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Nineteenth-century French novelist Gustave Flaubert loathed that
newfangled contraption, the steam locomotive. When there was talk
of laying track in his peaceful hometown of Croisset, he scoffed,
``What's the point? It will only bring in more people to be stupid
together.''
</P>
<P>
   Good thing Flaubert never wandered into an Internet chat room.
Online chat rooms _ basically, the real-time, typed equivalent of a
telephone conversation _ are open forums haunted by an assortment
of people with time on their hands.
</P>
<P>
   In the typical chat room, Monsieur and Mademoiselle Lonelyhearts
pretend to have sex while pretending they're someone else.
</P>
<P>
   Most investment chat rooms aren't much of an improvement. (To
find these places, do a quick search on the keywords ``Stock+Chat''
using an engine like Yahoo!)
</P>
<P>
   I've visited several of them, usually to discover that I'm the
only one to show up. The only time I encountered another virtual
creature, it dropped a hint about some suspiciously cheap,
unheard-of stock, then darted off. No wonder sites such as
InvestorExchange.com have closed their chat areas in favor of
bulletin boards, where investors don't converse but post and read
messages.
</P>
<P>
   Such behavior is par for the course. As one Silicon Valley
investor points out, ``If the people who inhabit these places and
give advice on stocks were taking their own advice, they'd have
better things to do than hang out in chat rooms.''
</P>
<P>
   An exception to the dismal run of chat rooms is the scheduled
variety hosted by legitimate Web sites, where investment movers and
shakers take real-time questions from participants.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft Network's Investor.com, for example, regularly sets up
scheduled chats with Wall Street stars, such as the recent seminar
``Investing for Growth and Income,'' sponsored by Charles Schwab &AMP;
Co. and featuring Robert Natale, a managing director at Bears
Stearns Asset Management.
</P>
<P>
   Also higher on the evolutionary scale are the newsgroups and
other threaded discussion forums _ bulletin boards focused on a
fairly narrow topic _ offered by the big online services and
portals, such as America Online, Microsoft Network, Compuserve,
Netscape, and Yahoo!
</P>
<P>
   Yahoo's Business and Finance message board
(http://messages.yahoo.com/yahoo/business_and_finance/index.html)
is typical of the genre, with discussions on such topics as
brokerage firms, upcoming initial public offerings, fund-trading
strategies, and overvalued stocks.
</P>
<P>
   The boards aren't without their share of hype and nonsense, but
practiced participants learn to separate the signal from the noise.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you take time to read with an unbiased eye, you can find
employees and insiders posting good information,'' says Michael
Burry, a physician in Palo Alto, Calif., who also writes an online
investment newsletter, ``Valuestocks.net.''
</P>
<P>
   Last spring he joined a Yahoo! group focused on the titanium
industry. ``There was a guy named Acroti, who said he was an
insider in the titanium business,'' Burry recalls. ``He told us
where the trends in titanium were going and that it would soon be
in a downturn.''
</P>
<P>
   Subsequent events showed Acroti to be ``dead on,'' says Burry,
and he now looks for postings that, like Acroti's, are delivered
with authority but without an apparent ax to grind. ``He posted
what he needed to post and didn't get involved in arguments,'' says
Burry.
</P>
<P>
   Fee-based or monitored Web sites are also good for weeding out
the riffraff. Burry's favorite site, Silicon Investor, charges a
$10 monthly fee, but he says the price is worth it. ``It's really
amazing to see the time and thought that some people put into their
posts, '' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Such sites tend to do a better job of shooing away the hucksters
than the open forums on sites such as Yahoo!
</P>
<P>
   In open discussion groups where users can create multiple
identifiers for themselves, stock pushers can create what looks
like a group discussion, usually around a small stock, when in fact
the entire conversation is the fabrication of a single person with
an interest in hyping the stock.
</P>
<P>
   When inspecting discussion groups, look for sites that post
clear ground rules and for discussions that stay on-topic. Don't
become embroiled in passionate debate right from the start.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, study the posted messages in various areas. If the site
appears to lack serious, concentrated discouse, lists several
postings by the same person (identified by a nickname), or allows
users to carry multiple nicknames, keep several grains of salt
handy.
</P>
<P>
   The following are some of the better sites:
</P>
<P>
   SILICON INVESTOR (www.siliconinvestor.com) is a members-only
club for investors in high tech. The $10-per-month price tag (or
$200 or a lifetime membership) discourages the weirdos and phonies.
More than 300,000 messages are posted monthly, some of them,
admittedly, of the amuse-and-schmooze variety but many of them
serious analyses of market events. There's also private E-mail for
members.
</P>
<P>
   THESTREET.COM (www.thestreet.com) also charges a $10 monthly fee
($100 a year), which buys access to the site's rather uneven news
coverage as well as to a portfolio tracker, a useful SEC Filings
feature, and plenty of intelligent debate. The Talk section offers
threaded discussions on travel and culture as well as investing.
</P>
<P>
   THE MOTLEY FOOL'S (http://boards.fool.com/) discussion boards,
which are free, let participants post questions on message boards
and receive replies. There are plenty of instructive tales as well
as a weekly roundup of the best postings.
</P>
<P>
   The Canadian firm StockGroup Interactive Media posts a free
forum, INVESTOR EXCHANGE (www.investorexchange.com). The monitored
discussions cover all aspects of investing, with a focus on
Canadian firms.
</P>
<P>
   MICROSOFT NETWORK INVESTOR (http://investor.msn.com), which
offers free and pay services, features forums plus scheduled and
open chats. A section called MoneyCentral
(http://moneycentral.msn.com) provides discussion groups on such
topics as retirement, credit, taxes, and insurance.
</P>
<P>
   CBS MarketWatch's STOCKCHAT (www.stockchat.com) is a free,
wide-ranging forum. You can search for discussion threads
alphabetically or by stock ticker symbol. The discussions are
monitored for obscenity and other breaches of netiquette.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the INVESTMENT FAQ (www.invest.faq.com) culls some of
the best postings from investment newsgroups, compiles the combined
wisdom into straightforward articles, and provides links to outside
sources.
</P>
<P>
   Even Flaubert would probably consider it a vast improvement over
live chat rooms. &QL;

<P>
   Nineteenth-century French novelist Gustave Flaubert loathed that
newfangled contraption, the steam locomotive. When there was talk
of laying track in his peaceful hometown of Croisset, he scoffed,
``What's the point? It will only bring in more people to be stupid
together.''
</P>
<P>
   Good thing Flaubert never wandered into an Internet chat room.
Online chat rooms _ basically, the real-time, typed equivalent of a
telephone conversation _ are open forums haunted by an assortment
of people with time on their hands.
</P>
<P>
   In the typical chat room, Monsieur and Mademoiselle Lonelyhearts
pretend to have sex while pretending they're someone else.
</P>
<P>
   Most investment chat rooms aren't much of an improvement. (To
find these places, do a quick search on the keywords ``Stock+Chat''
using an engine like Yahoo!)
</P>
<P>
   I've visited several of them, usually to discover that I'm the
only one to show up. The only time I encountered another virtual
creature, it dropped a hint about some suspiciously cheap,
unheard-of stock, then darted off. No wonder sites such as
InvestorExchange.com have closed their chat areas in favor of
bulletin boards, where investors don't converse but post and read
messages.
</P>
<P>
   Such behavior is par for the course. As one Silicon Valley
investor points out, ``If the people who inhabit these places and
give advice on stocks were taking their own advice, they'd have
better things to do than hang out in chat rooms.''
</P>
<P>
   An exception to the dismal run of chat rooms is the scheduled
variety hosted by legitimate Web sites, where investment movers and
shakers take real-time questions from participants.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft Network's Investor.com, for example, regularly sets up
scheduled chats with Wall Street stars, such as the recent seminar
``Investing for Growth and Income,'' sponsored by Charles Schwab &AMP;
Co. and featuring Robert Natale, a managing director at Bears
Stearns Asset Management.
</P>
<P>
   Also higher on the evolutionary scale are the newsgroups and
other threaded discussion forums _ bulletin boards focused on a
fairly narrow topic _ offered by the big online services and
portals, such as America Online, Microsoft Network, Compuserve,
Netscape, and Yahoo!
</P>
<P>
   Yahoo's Business and Finance message board
(http://messages.yahoo.com/yahoo/business_and_finance/index.html)
is typical of the genre, with discussions on such topics as
brokerage firms, upcoming initial public offerings, fund-trading
strategies, and overvalued stocks.
</P>
<P>
   The boards aren't without their share of hype and nonsense, but
practiced participants learn to separate the signal from the noise.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you take time to read with an unbiased eye, you can find
employees and insiders posting good information,'' says Michael
Burry, a physician in Palo Alto, Calif., who also writes an online
investment newsletter, ``Valuestocks.net.''
</P>
<P>
   Last spring he joined a Yahoo! group focused on the titanium
industry. ``There was a guy named Acroti, who said he was an
insider in the titanium business,'' Burry recalls. ``He told us
where the trends in titanium were going and that it would soon be
in a downturn.''
</P>
<P>
   Subsequent events showed Acroti to be ``dead on,'' says Burry,
and he now looks for postings that, like Acroti's, are delivered
with authority but without an apparent ax to grind. ``He posted
what he needed to post and didn't get involved in arguments,'' says
Burry.
</P>
<P>
   Fee-based or monitored Web sites are also good for weeding out
the riffraff. Burry's favorite site, Silicon Investor, charges a
$10 monthly fee, but he says the price is worth it. ``It's really
amazing to see the time and thought that some people put into their
posts, '' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Such sites tend to do a better job of shooing away the hucksters
than the open forums on sites such as Yahoo!
</P>
<P>
   In open discussion groups where users can create multiple
identifiers for themselves, stock pushers can create what looks
like a group discussion, usually around a small stock, when in fact
the entire conversation is the fabrication of a single person with
an interest in hyping the stock.
</P>
<P>
   When inspecting discussion groups, look for sites that post
clear ground rules and for discussions that stay on-topic. Don't
become embroiled in passionate debate right from the start.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, study the posted messages in various areas. If the site
appears to lack serious, concentrated discouse, lists several
postings by the same person (identified by a nickname), or allows
users to carry multiple nicknames, keep several grains of salt
handy.
</P>
<P>
   The following are some of the better sites:
</P>
<P>
   SILICON INVESTOR (www.siliconinvestor.com) is a members-only
club for investors in high tech. The $10-per-month price tag (or
$200 or a lifetime membership) discourages the weirdos and phonies.
More than 300,000 messages are posted monthly, some of them,
admittedly, of the amuse-and-schmooze variety but many of them
serious analyses of market events. There's also private E-mail for
members.
</P>
<P>
   THESTREET.COM (www.thestreet.com) also charges a $10 monthly fee
($100 a year), which buys access to the site's rather uneven news
coverage as well as to a portfolio tracker, a useful SEC Filings
feature, and plenty of intelligent debate. The Talk section offers
threaded discussions on travel and culture as well as investing.
</P>
<P>
   THE MOTLEY FOOL'S (http://boards.fool.com/) discussion boards,
which are free, let participants post questions on message boards
and receive replies. There are plenty of instructive tales as well
as a weekly roundup of the best postings.
</P>
<P>
   The Canadian firm StockGroup Interactive Media posts a free
forum, INVESTOR EXCHANGE (www.investorexchange.com). The monitored
discussions cover all aspects of investing, with a focus on
Canadian firms.
</P>
<P>
   MICROSOFT NETWORK INVESTOR (http://investor.msn.com), which
offers free and pay services, features forums plus scheduled and
open chats. A section called MoneyCentral
(http://moneycentral.msn.com) provides discussion groups on such
topics as retirement, credit, taxes, and insurance.
</P>
<P>
   CBS MarketWatch's STOCKCHAT (www.stockchat.com) is a free,
wide-ranging forum. You can search for discussion threads
alphabetically or by stock ticker symbol. The discussions are
monitored for obscenity and other breaches of netiquette.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the INVESTMENT FAQ (www.invest.faq.com) culls some of
the best postings from investment newsgroups, compiles the combined
wisdom into straightforward articles, and provides links to outside
sources.
</P>
<P>
   Even Flaubert would probably consider it a vast improvement over
live chat rooms. &QL;

 By SCOTT BURNS  
 c.1999 Worth Magazine  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It is a truth universally acknowledged that the road to real
money and mind-boggling returns is small-company stocks. But just
try following the path.
</P>
<P>
   Why have small stocks been so disappointing?
</P>
<P>
   Why have so many investors searched so hard to find so little?
</P>
<P>
   Why is it that only one small-stock fund beat the Standard &AMP;
Poor's 500 Stock Index over the past 15 years _ and then by less
than one-tenth of one percentage point?
</P>
<P>
   Why is it that more than 600 managers, scouring the most obscure
nooks and crannies of the known stock universe, seem to be falling
further and further behind, Internet fever notwithstanding?
</P>
<P>
   The time has come to examine a deep belief _ the idea that
small-company stocks will, in the long run, provide a higher return
than large-company stocks.
</P>
<P>
   It has a remarkably diverse array of adherents. Mavericks
believe because there is a romance attached to finding a small
company that will transform an industry _ or create one.
</P>
<P>
   Quantitative types believe because the largest and most revered
database, the virtual bible of modern portfolio theory, says small
stocks provide higher returns than big stocks.
</P>
<P>
   And commonsense types believe because it seems so logical: At
some point, a big company's ability to grow should be constrained
by its already massive size.
</P>
<P>
   Actual events, however, don't support the idea.
</P>
<P>
   The origins of the small-company stock creed are to be found in
the aforementioned bible: ``Stocks, Bonds, Bills, and Inflation,''
the Ibbotson Associates yearbook that provides data on asset
returns from 1926 to the present.
</P>
<P>
   The 1998 yearbook shows that large-company stocks _ as
represented by the S&AMP;P 500 _ have delivered a compound annual
return of 11 percent while small-company stocks have returned 12.7
percent. That extra return isn't free, however.
</P>
<P>
   Small-stock prices are more volatile than large-stock prices _
investors have to live with greater price risk while waiting for
their higher return.
</P>
<P>
   But the payoff is substantial. Put $1,000 into large stocks, and
the Ibbotson data say it will grow to $184,565 over 50 years. Make
the same investment in small stocks, and it will grow to $394,635
over the same period. Twice as much.
</P>
<P>
   The problem starts with the actual results of the professional
investors who are paid to capture that extra return.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of 1981, just months before the start of the stock
market's long rise, there were only 17 small-company funds. FPA
Capital, which Robert Rodriguez has run for 14 years, is the
best-performing fund in that group.
</P>
<P>
   In the 15 years that ended October 31, the fund provided a
compound annual return of 17.20 percent, enough to edge out the S&AMP;P
500's 17.11 percent return.
</P>
<P>
   Acorn Fund, managed by Ralph Wanger and Ralph McQuaid, was
second-best, returning 15.56 percent over the same period.
</P>
<P>
   Significantly, both funds beat the Russell 2000 _ a broad index
of small companies _ by a wide margin. Indeed, the two funds
performed so well that they lifted the 15-year average for the
entire small-stock category above the Russell index.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1981, the number of small-company funds has burgeoned to
682. Their track record, measured against the Russell 2000 index,
hasn't been bad. On average, they beat their index in three of five
measuring periods. What they haven't done is come close to the
returns on large-company stocks.
</P>
<P>
   One reason for the persistent faith in small stocks is that over
the past 15 years some companies have grown from tiny, struggling
start-ups into industry leaders, while some large companies that
were once seen as invincible have suffered devastating declines.
</P>
<P>
   In 1977, to cite just one example, Eastman Kodak had the
seventh-highest market value among U.S. stocks. Today it ranks
117th.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Microsoft had yet to go public in 1977, and neither
Dell Computer nor Compaq Computer had even been founded. Today,
Microsoft has the largest market capitalization of all U.S. stocks;
Dell and Compaq rank 31st and 45th, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   Surely, the divergent fates of Microsoft and Kodak represent the
general triumph of the small and entrepreneurial over the large and
bureaucratic.
</P>
<P>
   But they don't.
</P>
<P>
   Why? Two respected observers offer different, but related,
reasons. In ``Stocks for the Long Run,'' finance professor Jeremy
Siegel points out that small stocks' edge over large stocks
virtually disappears if the 1975-83 period is excluded from the
analysis.
</P>
<P>
   While some might object to simply removing a block of years from
a time series, it happens that small stocks lost 31 percent of
their value in 1973 and an additional 20 percent of their value in
1974.
</P>
<P>
   Little wonder, then, that small stocks did relatively well from
1975 to 1983. They were recovering from virtual obliteration.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, the price volatility of small stocks means that
market makers increase their bid/ask spreads _ that is, to
compensate for the added risk, they charge a higher markup when
buying or selling small stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Siegel cites a study showing that even in modern times the
spread on small stocks has been 2.65 percent, compared with 0.40
percent for large stocks. That wider spread wipes out the entire
long-term advantage of small stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Another explanation comes from value manager David Dreman. An
asterisk in the 1998 ``SBBI'' yearbook notes that the 12.7 percent
annual return of small-company stocks includes 1933, when their
total return was a stunning 142.9 percent. Large stocks have never
enjoyed a comparable one-year jump.
</P>
<P>
   Dreman found that trading in the 1931-35 period was very light,
with some 58 percent of the small-stock group not trading at all on
any given day. Not surprisingly, bid/ask spreads were enormous,
averaging 43 percent.
</P>
<P>
   We'll let the academics worry about the fine details. The
practical message is that market realities may hinder any investor
from reaping the benefits of small-stock investing _ if those
benefits exist at all.
</P>
<P>
   So what's an investor to do? Forget size _ it's just too
limiting.
</P>
<P>
   Consider that the median company on the Russell 2000 list has a
market capitalization of $220 million. If and when its market value
exceeds $1 billion, it will cease, by most conventional
definitions, to be a small stock.
</P>
<P>
   Investors who stick strictly to small stocks, then, are
voluntarily limiting their potential gains to what Peter Lynch
would call a ``five-bagger.'' That's giving up a lot of potential
upside.
</P>
<P>
   Even the most doctrinaire small-stock investor would probably
regret selling the likes of Cisco Systems ($125 billion in market
capitalization as of Dec. 8), Dell ($85 billion), or Oracle ($34
billion) when they became ``too big.''
</P>
<P>
   If there's anything to be learned from following the contrails
of these highfliers, it's that size doesn't matter. Good stocks
do. &QL;

HIGH SCHOOLS.') 
CALIFORNIA GUARANTEES SOME A PLACE IN UNIVERSITIES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (SUBS lede to change `top 4 percent of the state's high school
students' to `TOP 4 PERCENT OF THE STUDENTS IN EACH OF THE STATE'S(mk) 
 By DON TERRY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The University of California's board of regents
decided Friday to guarantee a place in the prestigious public
university system for the top 4 percent of the students in each of
the state's high schools.
</P>
<P>
   The rule, which will take effect in the fall of 2001, was one of
the most frequent promises that Gov. Gray Davis, a Democrat, made
in his campaign last year. It was seen by some people as an effort
to get around the affirmative action prohibitions that voters
approved in 1996 and to reverse the decline in the number of black
and Hispanic students being admitted to the system.
</P>
<P>
   But the rule is expected to result in only a tiny increase in
black and Hispanic students, officials at the University of
California said Friday. The rule will add about 3,600 students of
all ethnic backgrounds to the pool of eligible applicants, but less
than half of them are expected to enroll. About 43,000 freshmen
enrolled in the system last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a decent but not significant number of minorities''
in the expanded pool, said William Bagley, a regent and lawyer from
San Francisco who voted for the new rules. ``But it will be helpful
for those of us who think diversity is important.''
</P>
<P>
   The percent of black students who meet the university's
eligibility requirements will increase by just eight-tenths of 1
percent, to 3.6 percent from 2.8 percent. That would be an increase
of 161 students, half of whom would be expected to enroll. The
eligibility rate for Hispanic students will go to 4.7 percent from
3.8 percent, an increase of 716 students. The eligibility for Asian
students will go to 31.5 percent from 30 percent, and for white
students it will go to 14.4 percent from 12.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will probably help disadvantaged white children more than
any other group,'' said another regent, Howard Leach. ``It is
totally unrelated to affirmative action.''
</P>
<P>
   Bagley, the regent from San Francisco, said there were more than
800 high schools in California and that some of them ``supply
literally zero students to our campuses.''
</P>
<P>
   The board approved the new rules Friday after a subcommittee
recommended the change in a 13-1 vote on Thursday. The sole
dissenter was Meredith Khachigian, a regent from San Clemente.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to hold the schools accountable for providing the
courses and teaching to make students eligible for the
university,'' Ms. Khachigian said Friday. ``I felt this gave them a
pass. I'm concerned about students coming to the university and
competing with students who have a higher level of preparation.''
</P>
<P>
   Ward Connerly, the regent who led the fight against affirmative
action, voted for the new rules.
</P>
<P>
   ``At first I thought this 4-percent plan was a Trojan horse to
resurrect racial preferences,'' he said. ``But the more I looked at
it, the more I thought it was based on merit.''
</P>
<P>
   Sherry Bebitch Jaffe, a political scientist at the Claremont
Graduate University, said the new admission rule was ``by and large
a symbolic gesture'' without the remedial and financial aid
programs to make sure students from poor, inner-city high schools
and their rural cousins can compete with their more advantaged
classmates.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Jaffe said a student in the top 4 percent from a big urban
school, where the books and buildings are old and the history
teacher has to teach biology, is not the same as a student ranked
in the top 4 percent at a suburban school.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see any bridge programs to help the 4 percent who
qualify from poor, impoverished families and school districts,''
she said. ``The bridges have all been burned. If you really want to
bring these students up to speed, it will take will and money _
quite a bit of money.''
</P>
<P>
   Genethia Hayes, the executive director of the Southern Christian
Leadership Conference in Los Angeles, said much more money must be
spent to improve education in the lower grades. Otherwise, she
added, ``we are preparing these kids to fail.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What this plan allows people to do,'' Ms. Hayes said, ``is to
get off the hook of really having to do something about inequitable
sharing of educational resources, both human and capital.''
</P>
<P>
   She called the policy ``a silver bullet kind of thing.'' Still,
she said, it is a positive step.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Jaffe agreed, adding that as modest as the 4-percent policy
is, it would never have passed under former Gov. Pete Wilson, a
Republican.
</P>
<P>
   ``The new rule does send a message, and it's a positive
message,'' Ms. Jaffe said. ``It's a message of opportunity and that
there is a concern that the university be somewhat representative
of the diversity of the state. But I worry that it will raise false
hopes.''

MISSOURI TO REQUIRE BACKGROUND CHECKS FOR TEACHERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PHILLIP O'CONNOR  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Certified teachers moving to Missouri will
have to submit to an FBI background check that includes
fingerprinting before they can work in a public classroom.
</P>
<P>
   The Missouri Board of Education approved the fingerprinting
requirement Thursday as part of an emergency rule change, which has
other provisions aimed at making it easier to hire out-of-state
teachers. It marks the first time the state will require teachers
to be fingerprinted.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is to ensure that we have done everything possible to
make sure these individuals are not coming into our classrooms with
criminal histories that we're not aware of,'' said John Miller,
director of teacher certification.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas does not require mandatory fingerprinting of teachers.
Instead the state relies on county attorneys to report certain
crimes to the state Department of Education. In addition, some
local districts require fingerprinting.
</P>
<P>
   Fingerprinting is the latest weapon the state has introduced in
its battle to prevent or remove felons from teaching in the state's
classrooms.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the state conducted the first criminal records check
of Missouri teachers by comparing the list of certified teachers
against a state criminal database maintained by the Missouri
Highway Patrol. The search turned up 520 matches, including at
least 65 felony convictions for crimes such as rape, sodomy and
deviate sexual assault. The state has since moved to revoke many of
those certifications.
</P>
<P>
   That check did not require fingerprints and the search was
limited to crimes committed in Missouri. Even so, Miller said the
state had no plans to seek fingerprints from teachers who already
hold Missouri certification.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see any movement at this time in that direction.''
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Mel Carnahan vowed in December 1997 to make stronger
teacher certification legislation a priority. That followed stories
in The Kansas City Star detailing how the Kansas City School
District imposed little if any discipline on several staff members
accused of sexual misconduct with students, including some staff
members who had criminal records.
</P>
<P>
   The new rule will become effective 10 days after being filed
with the secretary of state's office. Miller said he expected the
rule to be filed next week.
</P>
<P>
   The spokesman for the state's largest teacher organization said
the group has consistently supported state-funded background
checks, but has not taken a position on fingerprinting. The new
rule will require applicants to pay for the background check.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think most people would resist the idea of fingerprinting _
but we have not as an association debated that issue _ but support
keeping felons out of the classroom,'' said Bruce Moe, of the
42,000-member Missouri State Teachers Association.
</P>
<P>
   Another provision of the rule change granted reciprocity to
teachers certified by other states. Officials say the move is aimed
in part at addressing a pending teacher shortage.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, teachers moving to Missouri were granted
certification only after the state conducted a rigorous analysis of
the applicant's college transcript.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had no way to recognize their experience or capacity to
teach,'' Miller said.
</P>
<P>
   According to the new rule, such applicants would be required
only to pass the state assessment test in their subject area before
being granted a Missouri license.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's more reflective of an accountable system,'' Miller said.
``It's `Can you do this?' not `Did you have the course work?' ''

INTERNET HELPS KEEP BIG BROTHER IN CHECK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY HEASTER  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED: The Internet may prove as much a boost for economic
freedom as it is for commercial activity.
</P>
<P>
   At least that's the gratifying conclusion to be drawn from the
recent revelation that regulators seem set to abandon an Orwellian
scheme to transform your banker into your Big Brother.
</P>
<P>
   When the public-comment period ended for the proposed
know-your-customer rules, the head of the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corp. signaled her intent to shelve the proposal. She was
responding to a deluge of criticism of the initiative, most of
which seemingly came by e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   By the final day allowed for public feedback, the number of
e-mail responses was estimated to be 225,000, and it was
overwhelmingly negative. Meantime, the political fallout spread to
Capitol Hill, where resistance was said to be mounting. At the end
of the comment period, the FDIC chief said she would urge her
regulatory colleagues to drop the bid, which could happen at a
meeting scheduled for Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   One of the more interesting aspects of this development is that
the overwhelming outcry developed in what was mostly a media
vacuum. During the early phase of the proposal's rollout, newspaper
and television coverage of the issue was exceedingly scarce, even
though it posed a serious threat to the basic economic freedoms of
most Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Much of this vacuum was filled by the Internet, where word of
the regulatory proposal's onerous nature was spread. The Internet
also provided a convenient and expeditious way for concerned
bankers and their customers to communicate their objections to the
regulators.
</P>
<P>
   Though the regulation has been offered in the spirit of catching
drug traffickers and money launderers, it threatens an egregious
assault on the first principles on which the nation was founded. As
such, it ignored that the current regulations designed to monitor
big money deals for wrongdoing should be more than sufficient to
catch the real bad guys.
</P>
<P>
   There is a good argument to be made, in fact, that more such
regulation would make catching actual criminals more difficult
because paperwork generated by existing rules overwhelms the
process.
</P>
<P>
   CIA turncoat Aldrich Ames, for example, went undetected even
though his spymasters were providing him huge sums through normal
banking channels. His payoffs were probably missed because they
were obscured by the mountains of minutia already confronting those
who police these matters.
</P>
<P>
   Without putting too fine a point on it, the proposal would turn
bankers into snoops and snitches. As such, they would be required
to make highly subjective judgments about what constitutes
``unusual and inconsistent'' transactions for even their most
average law-abiding customers. Far from protecting society from
criminals, this would be Big Brotherism at its worst, with life in
America imitating George Orwell's literary art in his 1984 novel.
</P>
<P>
   If the proposal gets the funeral it deserves, it will happen to
a significant degree because the Internet's democratizing potential
filled a role historically served by media watchdogs fulfilling
their check-and-balance responsibility as the unofficial fourth
branch of government.
</P>
<P>
   Nature, it would seem, still abhors a vacuum.

WHEN CHECKING INTO A HOTEL, CHECK OUT THE SAFETY FEATURES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD ESPINOZA  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   OVERLAND PARK, Kan. _ Jerry Ingram knows there's more to a good
hotel than a workout room and a concierge. Since the Overland Park
man survived a Las Vegas hotel fire that killed eight persons in
1981, he won't stay in any place that wasn't built with fire safety
in mind.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday morning, Ingram and Overland Park Fire Battalion
Chief Ted McIntosh used the Overland Park Marriott's 11th floor to
demonstrate to the media ways to safely escape a hotel fire.
</P>
<P>
   Ingram always looks for fire alarms, sprinklers and at least two
fire exits, and he won't sleep higher than the second floor. He
learned the importance of fire safety 18 years ago when a hotel
busboy set fire to the eighth floor of the Las Vegas Hilton. Ingram
was in his ninth-floor room when he heard windows breaking.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was in Las Vegas. I thought it was drunks breaking glass,''
Ingram said.
</P>
<P>
   He rushed out of his room when he realized fire was shattering
the hotel windows, but before he could reach a stairway, someone in
a hotel uniform told him to get into an elevator, he said. The
elevator stopped on the eighth floor, which had filled with black
smoke. He dropped to his hands and knees just before another man in
the elevator succumbed to the smoke. Ingram crawled blindly through
the darkness.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was deathly quiet,'' he said. ``I thought everyone in the
hotel was dead.''
</P>
<P>
   By staying low, Ingram managed to bump his way down the hall
until he reached a room where a woman was stuffing wet towels at
the bottom of her door. Ingram and the woman stayed in the room for
about 90 minutes until firefighters rescued them.
</P>
<P>
   The best way to survive a hotel fire is to prepare for disaster.
McIntosh recommends that travelers pack a flashlight, medical
information, a first-aid kit, a notebook for recording escape
routes and duct tape for sealing vents and doors from smoke. As
soon as you check into a hotel, walk the two nearest escape routes
to make sure you can get out quickly without any surprises.
</P>
<P>
   If an alarm sounds, grab your key in case you have to retreat to
your room, and then check the door. If it's cool, stay close to the
floor and crawl to a stairway. Never use an elevator in a fire.
</P>
<P>
   If you have to stay in your room, use duct tape or wet towels at
the bottom of the door and around vents to keep smoke out. Dial 911
to let someone know where you are. Fill the bathtub with water and
use the ice bucket to splash water on hot walls and floors.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last thing you want to do is break a window,'' McIntosh
said. ``That's just another avenue for smoke to come into your
room.''
</P>
<P>
   The only time to break the window is if too much smoke is
pouring into your room for you to breathe.
</P>
<P>
   Sprinklers will control or extinguish fires 97 percent of the
time, McIntosh said, but they're not required in all hotels.
Travelers should always ask about sprinklers when they make
reservations, Ingram said.
Hotel fire safety tips
</P>
<P>
   - When you reserve a room, ask whether the hotel has sprinklers
and smoke detectors.
</P>
<P>
   - Take along duct tape and a first-aid kit.
</P>
<P>
   - Walk the two closest fire-escape routes as soon as you check
in.
</P>
<P>
   - If an alarm sounds, check the door. If the door isn't too hot
to open, crawl toward an exit. Otherwise, seal the door and vents
with wet towels or duct tape.
</P>
<P>
   - Remember that firefighters probably can't rescue you from the
outside if you're above the sixth floor. Anyone staying higher than
that will have to depend heavily on the building's safety features
and escape routes.

HASEK AND SABRES BEAT RANGERS IN OVERTIME, 3-2 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By JOE LAPOINTE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It is not easy to beat Dominik Hasek, especially for
the New York Rangers. Even in a mediocre season by Hasek's high
standards, the league's premier goalie returned from an injury
Friday night with a record of 5-0-2 in his previous seven
appearances against the Blue Shirts.
</P>
<P>
   Playing for the first time in a month, Hasek stopped 27 of 29
Rangers shots, some of them with the creative contortions for which
he is known. His Buffalo Sabres teammates supported him by coming
back from a one-goal deficit late in the third period to win it in
overtime, 3-2, on the second goal of the night by Miroslav Satan at
Madison Square Garden.
</P>
<P>
   Satan scored at 1 minute 18 seconds of overtime by whipping the
puck past Rangers goalie Mike Richter high on the glove side from
the right-wing circle while on the power play. The manpower
advantage was created in the final minute of regulation when the
Rangers' Mathieu Schneider slashed Buffalo's Mike Peca when Peca
was on a breakaway while killing a penalty.
</P>
<P>
   The result left the Rangers three points behind the Boston
Bruins in the race for the eighth and final playoff berth in the
Eastern Conference. However, they have played two more games than
the Bruins and have only 13 games remaining. The Rangers went 0-3-1
against the Sabres this season.
</P>
<P>
   With both teams rested and the crowd in a festive, Friday mood,
the game had a brisk pace and a nasty edge. Until late in the third
period, the Rangers led by 2-1 on power-play goals by Schneider and
Petr Nedved. But the Sabres tied it at 2-2 on the power play at
11:40 on a slap shot by Michal Grosek. The Rangers' Scott Fraser
was in the penalty box for slashing.
</P>
<P>
   Also playing well was Richter, who stopped 21 of 24 shots. One
of his best saves came with less than two minutes left in
regulation, when he came out from his crease to stop Peca on a
breakaway after a Fraser turnover. Peca, the Buffalo captain, was
one of the best players on the ice.
</P>
<P>
   Hasek was back in the Buffalo net for the first time since Feb.
17, when he suffered a groin strain during a 3-2 loss to Toronto.
During his absence, the Sabres went 5-4-3 and had won their
previous two games.
</P>
<P>
   The Sabres went to the Eastern Conference finals last spring and
lost to Washington. They think they can advance at least that far
this year and could be active before the trade deadline on Tuesday.
They recently sent Matthew Barnaby to the Pittsburgh Penguins for
Stu Barnes, an exchange of forwards. They entered the game with a
record of 31-23-13, third in the Northeast Division and seventh in
the conference.
</P>
<P>
   The Sabres scored the first goal, Satan beating Richter on a
breakaway with a backhander at 10:21 of the first period after a
turnover by Brian Leetch at the Rangers' blue line. But the Rangers
scored the next two goals, both on the power play and both set up
in part by Leetch.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers tied it at 12:47 of the first period when Schneider
scored his eighth goal of the season with a slap shot from just
above the left-wing circle. With a two-man advantage, they went up
by 2-1 at 5:44 of the second period on Nedved's 18th goal of the
season, a high wrist shot that was aided by a John MacLean screen
in front of Hasek's crease after Nedved won the face-off in the
left-wing circle.
</P>
<P>
   Although he did not figure in the scoring in the first 40
minutes, the rookie Manny Malhotra of the Rangers stood out on
several exciting plays. Twice in the second period, he was stopped
by Hasek on excellent scoring chances.
</P>
<P>
   On the first, Malhotra sailed in clear on Hasek, who has won
both the Vezina and the Hart trophies in the last two seasons as
best goalie and most valuable player in the league. Malhotra faked
Hasek onto his back and tried to flip the puck over him, but Hasek
blocked it with his leg extended upward.
</P>
<P>
   Malhotra's next chance, also a clear shot, was low and stopped
by the goalie standing up.
</P>
<P>
   Malhotra also seemed to be a target of the Sabres. In the first
period, his helmeted head snapped back when rammed against the
glass by Richard Smehlik. In the second period, Darryl Shannon
seemed to hurt him when he caught Malhotra's left thigh with his
hip in an open-ice hit that resulted in a Buffalo penalty. Later,
Malhotra was cut over his upper lip in another collision near the
glass.

JEAN PIERRE-BLOCH, 93, RESISTANCE FIGHTER FOR FRANCE 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By RICHARD GOLDSTEIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Jean Pierre-Bloch, a French Resistance figure, high-ranking
member of de Gaulle's Free French movement during World War II and
spokesman for human rights causes, died March 17 at a hospital in
Paris. He was 93.
</P>
<P>
   Pierre-Bloch, a Socialist member of the prewar French
Parliament, was captured while fighting against the Germans at the
outset of World War II. He escaped from a prisoner of war camp in
1940, the year France fell to the Nazis.
</P>
<P>
   In 1941 he and his wife, Gaby, began organizing Resistance
activities and helped arrange some of the first parachute drops
into France of agents, arms and equipment sent by de Gaulle's
headquarters in London.
</P>
<P>
   When Pierre-Bloch and his wife went to Marseilles in October
1941 to distribute money that had been parachuted in for Resistance
leaders, the French police arrested them. Mrs. Pierre-Bloch had two
lists of names of Resistance figures in the area, but she swallowed
one piece of paper and managed to destroy the other.
</P>
<P>
   The Pierre-Blochs were imprisoned on treason charges, but Mrs.
Pierre-Bloch was released after three months to care for their
three children. Over the next five months, she hid money, keys and
saws in parcels of food she took to her husband, and in July 1942
Pierre-Bloch escaped along with five British officers.
</P>
<P>
   He became a key official in de Gaulle's military intelligence
operation in London, the unit that dropped agents into France and
orchestrated sabotage of German installations.
</P>
<P>
   Pierre-Bloch also served as undersecretary of the interior on
the French Committee of National Liberation, the government in
exile that de Gaulle set up after transferring his headquarters to
Algiers in the summer of 1943.
</P>
<P>
   He served in the committee's consultative assembly, an 84-member
body set up in November 1943 as the first French deliberative
council since the legislature was dissolved in 1940.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Pierre-Bloch joined her husband in July 1943, having
escaped from France after learning that she had been sentenced to a
20-year prison term in absentia for aiding Allied airmen who had
been shot down.
</P>
<P>
   Pierre-Bloch was among 24 jurors _ all formerly members of the
French Parliament or the Resistance _ who in August 1945 found
Marshal Henri Philippe Petain guilty of treason for collaborating
with the Germans as the head of the wartime Vichy-based regime.
</P>
<P>
   Although imposing a death sentence on the 89-year-old Petain,
the jurors and three judges recommended that it not be carried out
because of his age. De Gaulle spared Petain, who died in prison in
1951. Pierre-Bloch was the last surviving member of the Petain
jury, according to Agence-France Presse.
</P>
<P>
   Pierre-Bloch, the son of an industrialist, received a law degree
from the Sorbonne. He wrote for French newspapers and then, in
1936, at 31, became the youngest member of Parliament in Prime
Minister Leon Blum's leftist Popular Front government.
</P>
<P>
   After World War II, Pierre-Bloch became president of the
National Press Corp., formed by the French government to liquidate
the property of newspapers and advertising agencies that had
collaborated with the Germans.
</P>
<P>
   Pierre-Bloch, president of the International League Against
Racism and Anti-Semitism from 1968 to 1992 and its honorary
president at his death, was known for his writings denouncing
racism and oppression of minorities around the world. He was the
author of ``Charles de Gaulle'' (1944); ``The Causes of
Anti-Semitism in France'' (1956), and ``London, the Capital of Free
France'' (1985).
</P>
<P>
   French President Jacques Chirac paid tribute to Pierre-Bloch, a
member of the Legion of Honor, citing his ``passion for freedom.''
Prime Minister Lionel Jospin said that Pierre-Bloch's campaigns
against racism ``incarnated the values of the French Republic.''
</P>
<P>
   Pierre-Bloch's wife died in 1996. He is survived by their three
children.

GATORNATIONALS CAMPGROUND IS A SHOW IN ITSELF 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Fla., N.H., Texas, Calif., Ga., Canada, Germany, U.K.)  (js) 
 By BOB ARNDORFER   The Gainesville (Fla.) Sun   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   GAINESVILLE, Fla. _ Last year at what might be called the
Gatornationals garden of good and evil, Darrell Hampton of Atlanta
was chatting with a woman who was sitting naked in a pickup truck.
When the woman's husband came over and said to him, ``It's time to
go,'' Hampton left.
</P>
<P>
   No offense intended, none taken.
</P>
<P>
   That's the way it is here, say Hampton and other denizens of the
garden, also known as the Gainesville Jaycees' campground, which is
a mile from Gainesville Raceway where the National Hot Rod
Association is staging the Mac Tools Gatornationals through Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The campground is where during the 30-year-old Gatornationals,
the party never ends and conflict rarely begins.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are here just to have a good time,'' Hampton, a
31-year-old construction worker, said Thursday inside the
``Gatornationals Party Animals Compound'' at the camp. ``They don't
come here to fight.''
</P>
<P>
   They do, however, come to drink.
</P>
<P>
   ``They come to get toasted,'' said Gene Sweeney of Melbourne,
relaxing with a straight Coke _ he gave up demon rum when he turned
50 _ behind the wheel of his $720,000 Bluebird Wanderlodge motor
home. ``It's a sideshow all over the place.''
</P>
<P>
   Sweeney, 55, is a retired computer salesman who has stayed at
the camp about 15 years. Sharing his luxury digs in what they
jokingly call the ``respectable'' section of the campground are his
wife, Jan, and brother-in-law, Herb Lucas.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's always the drags, that's the big thing,'' said Lucas, an
independent sales representative from Bedford, N.H., who flies in
each year to join the Sweeneys at the campground. ``But out here
it's a lot of fun just walking around and watching all the
crazies.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's always clean fun,'' Gene Sweeney added. ``In 15 years,
I've never seen a fight.''
</P>
<P>
   The Jaycees have run the county-owned, 40-acre campground for
some 25 years, said Ed Olowin, a pharmacist who takes a week's
vacation every year to help run the camp. By Saturday, he said,
they will have filled 500 of their $20 campsites with everything
from upscale RVs to pup tents. At its peak, party town will number
some 2,500 residents, including some regulars from Germany, England
and Canada.
</P>
<P>
   The Gatornationals is expected to attract 130,000 to
Gainesville, including an audience of 60,000 on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Through the pine trees from the ``respectable'' district is
rowdy central, where the biggest of the camp's parties are held.
It's home to the Party Animals Compound, a complex hosted by
Hampton and half a dozen bleary eyed buddies whose posted mottoes
include: ``When you're stupid, you gotta be tough.''
</P>
<P>
   The buddies come from Texas, California, Georgia and Florida,
meeting each other at the campground every year. They welcome all
FUBARs _ it means, loosely, Fouled Up Beyond All Recognition, a
reference to a person's state of intoxication _ to their
high-decibel campsite. Their supreme achievement last year was
getting the Budweiser Girls to join their party.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a nice getaway,'' said Larry Buitron, 45, a meat cutter
from Miami who said he first came to the races 24 years ago with a
friend and seven cases of beer. ``It's a guys' thing. You need to
do things you can look forward to.''
</P>
<P>
   Craig Smith, 46, an almanac of drag racing facts, is generally
credited with organizing the doings at the compound. He owns some
Arby's restaurants in Okeechobee, but his chief job, he said, is
``I have fun.'' In 25 years of camping at the Gatornationals, he
said, he too has never seen a fight.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's simple,'' Smith said. ``We're too old to fight.''
</P>
<P>
   Bonnie and Jerry Ash, a white-haired couple from Stuart, have
been coming to what they call the ``mud, blood and beer'' fest for
10 years. As they stretched out the awning on their camper trailer
a short hike from rowdyville, they said they belong to a Ferrari
club, attend NASCAR races and drag races.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sports car people stay in a hotel,'' said Jerry Ash, retired
from the mini-storage business his wife still runs. ``NASCAR people
stay in motor homes. And drag racers sleep in tents beside
bonfires.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's no fun to go to a race and sit in a hotel room,'' Bonnie
Ash said. She said nothing she's ever seen in a decade of attending
the Gatornationals' wildest party has bothered her.
</P>
<P>
   At the campground, she added, she can do something she'd never
do if she stayed at a motel in the city.
</P>
<P>
   ``A friend of mine and I wander around here at midnight,'' she
said. ``A woman can feel perfectly safe here.''

BUMPS OR NO BUMPS, MERRILL LYNCH'S STEAMROLLER ROLLS ON  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Japan)   By JOSEPH KAHN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Juggernaut. Steamroller. Mother Merrill. Those are the nicknames
most commonly associated with Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co., a brokerage firm
that long ago decided that it wanted to be No. 1, or very close to
it, in everything Wall Street does.
</P>
<P>
   The names were never more valid than last year, when Merrill
simultaneously pursued three huge international acquisitions, set
records in its giant worldwide bond business, and took in hundreds
of millions of dollars each day from investors seeking to ride the
bull market.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, though, that image has been tarnished. Like many
rivals, Merrill was hit hard by a slump in financial markets last
fall. Unlike many, it did not snap back quickly, some current and
former employees say. Many of them contend that an aura of
invincibility has given way to a crisis of confidence in some
crucial businesses.
</P>
<P>
   All this has led to renewed speculation about Merrill's allying
itself with a bigger partner, including Chase Manhattan Corp. Such
talk has caused Merrill's stock price to rise in recent days. Some
people close to the firm say that if Merrill enters a merger now _
and some at Merrill say that the chances of merging with a bank are
higher now than at any time in recent years _ it will probably be
on weaker terms than the firm could have commanded a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   In particular, Merrill faces losses that ballooned beyond
expectations in Japan, where it bought a failed securities company
last year but has found the cost of building a new operation there
staggering. Merrill's world-leading business of issuing and trading
debt for companies and governments is also in upheaval, people
involved in that business said. The firm is facing defections of
important staff members and slippage in areas where it long
smothered the competition.
</P>
<P>
   Either of those troubles by themselves might not amount to much
for Merrill, which prides itself on having diversified its earnings
to prevent downturns in one area from hurting overall profits. But
Merrill is putting out fires all over the place these days. It is
scrambling to catch up with online trading companies that threaten
its retail brokers, revamping its weak-performing mutual funds, and
trying to inject a shot of adrenaline into Mercury Asset
Management, the big London-based fund manager it bought recently.
</P>
<P>
   ``A year ago, this company was going to take over the world,''
said Sallie Krawcheck, who follows Merrill for Sanford C.
Bernstein. ``Now people are talking about it as a potential
turnaround story.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Krawcheck recommends that investors buy stock in the firm's
archrival, Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, rather than Merrill. But she
sees great potential for the future if Merrill figures out the
Internet and its international expansion bears fruit.
</P>
<P>
   Merrill officials acknowledge that the firm has undertaken a
``wrenching'' overhaul of its debt business. They also say that it
faces larger-than-expected losses in Japan. But they strongly
dispute that all this amounts to trouble for the firm.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea that somehow a large part of our business is in
disarray is fallacious,'' Jim Wiggins, a Merrill spokesman, said.
``There's no question that we have moved quickly to redeploy
resources to areas that have the greatest future promise. But we
are running record revenues in every category that we do business
in.''
</P>
<P>
   Merrill's earnings fell to $1.3 billion last year from almost $2
billion in 1997, largely because it suffered an $850 million loss
in its bond business. But Wiggins emphasized that other areas,
including investment banking, asset management and brokerage
commissions, were earning record profits.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Merrill has been criticized in the past for spending
heavily abroad, but has often proved critics wrong. It took a
beating after it paid top dollar for the British brokerage house
Smith Newcourt in 1995; most analysts now consider that purchase a
runaway success.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, troubles in Merrill's debt business have proved
trickier to resolve than most people had expected. Some Merrill
bankers, including several who remain at the firm and many who have
left, said David H. Komansky, Merrill's chairman, and his No. 2,
Herbert M. Allison Jr., overreacted to the bond market downturn
last fall by cutting too deeply. They are now struggling to rebuild
morale and performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``They panicked, plain old palpable panic,'' said one former
Merrill executive who left the firm voluntarily. ``They were
shooting guys who bleed Merrill colors because they needed someone
to blame.''
</P>
<P>
   Merrill dismissed some 3,500 people from its fixed-income
division in the fall, far more than any other Wall Street firm. It
also reduced the amount of capital devoted to its debt business,
especially corporate debt and foreign government debt. Capital
devoted to corporate debt, for example, fell to $21.6 billion from
$35.5 billion, according to Merrill's annual report.
</P>
<P>
   The staff reductions and reallocation of capital represent a sea
change in what had been seen as an almost sacred part of its
franchise, people at the firm said. Komansky long mandated that
Merrill occupy the No. 1 spot across the board in debt. The firm
promised to serve customers anywhere, anytime. To fulfill that
edict, Merrill often used its own capital to buy bonds that
customers wanted to sell, even if there was no immediate buyer.
</P>
<P>
   All that seemed to change in the fall, when Merrill nearly shut
down its bond operation for weeks, Merrill executives and
institutional clients said. The business is up and running again,
but many say its future shape remains a question mark.
</P>
<P>
   Continued losses of important Merrill executives are adding to
the uncertainty. Recent defections include David Webb, director of
the Merrill unit that raises money for leveraged buyouts; Thomas
Gahan, global leader of leveraged finance; Seth Waugh, the former
top executive of the global debt business; David Tory, in charge of
corporate bonds in Europe, and Nabeel Nabulsi, director of bond
sales in Europe. All were longtime Merrill executives whom Komansky
and Allison sought to keep, people close to the firm said.
</P>
<P>
   Rethinking how best to manage the debt business was inevitable
after last fall's losses, Merrill officials said. They said the new
leaders in most debt operations had acted fast to reshape the units
and reduce the capital at risk. But they insisted that this would
not diminish Merrill's commitment to customers.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In Japan, Merrill's purchase of the defunct Yamaichi Securities
was greeted as a master stroke, positioning it to build a United
States-style brokerage operation just as Japan climbed out of its
long recession. But Japan's slump has proved stubborn, and costs
have bloated. Merrill lost $230 million on the retail operation
there last year, considerably more than it had predicted. This
year's losses will probably hit $300 million, with some people
close to the operation saying the results could be even worse.
</P>
<P>
   Japanese middle-class investors have not been as quick to open
brokerage accounts as Merrill had hoped, and the amount of assets
the firm has gathered there has proved disappointing, people close
to the operation said. In part, they said, that is because the
firm's American-style approach has met resistance in Japan. For
example, Merrill asks clients to fill out a long questionnaire
about their income and their families, information many Japanese
are not eager to disclose to a broker.
</P>
<P>
   Merrill does not dispute that losses in Japan are heavy. But
Wiggins said the firm always expected that it would take three
years for the operation to break even. The losses are also pretax,
Wiggins noted, meaning that the impact on Merrill's bottom line is
less severe than the numbers suggest.
</P>
<P>
   Whether setbacks like this mean that Merrill is more receptive
to overtures from banks is a hot topic of discussion at the firm,
fueled most recently by reports of a coming article in Forbes
magazine that explores a potential link with Chase.
</P>
<P>
   Talks between Chase and Merrill last year produced no deal, in
part because Merrill demanded big concessions in running the
combined banking behemoth, and also asked that Chase pay a hefty
premium over Merrill's stock price at the time, people close to
those talks said. Adding to doubts is word that Chase, which has
sought a merger partner for months, is at the moment exploring ties
with J.P. Morgan, not Merrill, people close to the two banks said.
</P>
<P>
   But insiders do not rule out the prospect of Komansky's
considering a deal that would dispel the gloom at the firm. As one
person close to the firm put it, ``That's one way to be alpha dog
again.''  &QL;

NEW CURRENCY SPROUTS IN MENDOCINO 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By ANDREW LaMAR Santa Rosa (Calif.) Press Democrat   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MENDOCINO, Calif. _ The independence of this tiny coastal
village known for its striking ocean vistas and vibrant artistic
community has never been in doubt.
</P>
<P>
   But for many who make their home in this isolated region, the
next paycheck is sometimes very much in question.
</P>
<P>
   It's partly for that reason, activists say, that they launched a
local currency. The Mendocino coast joined the ranks of more than
65 other communities across the country when it began issuing its
own bills three weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   SEED, which stands for Self-Sufficient Ecological Economic
Development, can be purchased for between $5 and $5,000 and used to
supplement U.S. dollars for the purchase of local goods and
services. The SEED organizing committee uses the money raised by
selling the bills to pay for printing costs and for a newsletter
that lists the businesses and people who accept the local currency.
</P>
<P>
   One SEED is the equivalent of roughly $10 U.S. dollars, or one
hour of work, whether you're a lawyer or a ditch digger. People
with the new currency are encouraged to use it to buy services or
goods from someone else in the community.
</P>
<P>
   ``This seemed like it would be fun,'' said Susan Hofberg, who
began discussing the idea with a dozen fellow organizers over a
year ago. ``It's really the right thing to do, to have a barter
network facilitated by a currency that works for our community.''
</P>
<P>
   The idea of a home-grown currency was prompted by fear that
modern commerce is siphoning cash away from the Mendocino coast.
</P>
<P>
   Organizers say the rise of inland malls and Internet shopping
has added to the economic woes of the region, which has watched
timber and fishing jobs dwindle over the past two decades.
</P>
<P>
   The key, according to Hofberg, is where the money goes. SEED
remains in the community forever, whereas money spent at chain
stores goes to the corporate headquarters and is used in the
corporations' interests.
</P>
<P>
   Already, 200 people have signed up for the new currency, which
is to be exchanged in coastal communities between Elk and Westport.
The money is legal because it is backed by a nonprofit agency and
has a value greater than $1. SEED also comes in one-half,
one-quarter and one-eighth denominations, and all four SEED notes
are adorned with the work of coastal artists.
</P>
<P>
   Stanley Miklose, who has run the Down Home Foods health food
store in Fort Bragg for 24 years, jumped on board after hearing
about it. The store accepts SEED to supplement any purchase of more
than $15.
</P>
<P>
   Along with strengthening the community's reliance upon itself,
the new bills will add to the Mendocino coast's allure as a tourist
destination, Miklose said.
</P>
<P>
   One beauty of the new currency is that it has attracted support
from all coastal political persuasions, which run the gamut from
ultraliberals in Mendocino to working-class conservatives in Fort
Bragg, said organizer Margaret Howe.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone believes it's a good idea to keep the money here,''
Howe said.
</P>
<P>
   Proponents of local currency cite many reasons for the
popularity of the movement. The barter-like exchange of community
bills requires interaction that heightens people's awareness of
their community and counteracts forces, such as computers and
automobiles, that can serve to drive communities apart, they say.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are now part of a nationwide movement,'' the SEED Exchange
newsletter proclaimed, ``that emphasizes trust, cooperation, and
regionalism _ qualities that can be very uplifting in this era of
corporate control and environmental worries.''
</P>
<P>
   However, it may take several years to build the circulation of
the bills. Advocates of local currency who started the trend eight
years ago in Ithaca, N.Y., advise building money slowly to avoid
inflationary problems.
</P>
<P>
   Also, Hofberg said, people must become accustomed to the bills
and how to use them. The health food cooperative Hofberg helps
manage in Mendocino is already struggling with how to distribute
the new bills to employees.
</P>
<P>
   Another critical element is enlisting people with a diversity of
skills so the money can be used for more than a massage or a vase
made by a local artisan. Initial members include one lawyer and a
community health clinic, and Hofberg would like to see the
professional services expand.
</P>
<P>
   The new money couldn't be better for Bernie MacDonald, a former
computer instructor who is working to develop an electric vehicle
at his home in Mendocino, he said. He can earn SEED by assisting
people with their computers and then use the SEED for everyday
living.
</P>
<P>
   Recently he purchased 20 gallons of organic compost for his
greenhouse for 10 SEED.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes the day-to-day economics more obvious,'' MacDonald
said. ``My personal belief is community activity is local economic
activity.''

BEANIE BABY BANDIT ARRESTED ; GIGI, JAKE AND JABBER STILL MISSING  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By DAVID M. HALBFINGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   GARDEN CITY, N.Y. _ The Beanie Baby Bandit is safely behind
bars, the Suffolk County police said Friday. But the litter that
was stolen from a Centerport stationery shop last month _ 200
floppy creatures with names like Gigi, Jake and Jabber _ appears to
have been lost forever.
</P>
<P>
   Eight days ago, the case, investigated by detectives from the
2nd Precinct, had grown cold. But a March 11 press release from
Crime Stoppers of Suffolk County drew a blitz of news coverage, and
television news programs broadcast videotape taken by a security
camera at the shop that showed the burglar in a Syracuse University
jacket.
</P>
<P>
   Watching at home, detectives from the 7th Precinct recognized
the man as Douglas Gibbs, 57, of Ronkonkoma, whom they had arrested
five days earlier and charged with a gas station burglary in Rocky
Point. Gibbs' mother-in-law told detectives that she, too, had seen
the tape, and agreed that he was the burglar, the police said.
</P>
<P>
   With Gibbs behind bars, the police searched his home last
Saturday and found the Syracuse jacket, and the cash register and
lottery ticket dispenser stolen from Hope's Stationery, officials
said. The cash-and-scratch tickets were gone and so were the Beanie
Babies. The police did find about 20 of the pellet-packed
playthings at Gibbs' home, but they apparently were no relation to
the missing Babies. ``The store owner can't ID the ones we
recovered,'' said Lt. Frank Stallone.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Scicutella, the shopkeeper, said he had moved from anger
to acceptance. ``I want to just move on,'' he said. ``I didn't even
want to press charges. But with the coverage the police gave me, I
didn't really have a choice.''

FEDERAL BUDGET COMMITTEE LOOKS TO GET $500 MILLION FOR GOVERNORS
ISLAND 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By   JAMES DAO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The federal budget is chock-full of them every
year: sources of revenue based more on wishful thinking than
hard-headed analysis. They help balance the budget on paper, though
they may not produce a dime. One of them happens to be a historic
island in New York Harbor.
</P>
<P>
   Since enacting the budget of 1997, Congress has presumed that
the federal government would earn $500 million by auctioning off
Governors Island in 2002. Real estate developers and city officials
consider the price hilariously high because the cost of developing
and maintaining the 173-acre island is expected to be immense,
potentially requiring government assistance. But removing the item
from the government's long-term budget plan would require finding
another $500 million to replace it, a daunting task.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the Senate Budget Committee has approved legislation
sponsored by a bipartisan group of Midwestern senators that would
move up the sale of Governors Island to next year, so the money
could be used to expand federal crop insurance for farmers. The
full Senate is expected to take up the bill next week.
</P>
<P>
   New York officials are reacting with a mixture of amusement and
alarm.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't take this seriously,'' Deputy Mayor Randy L. Levine
said. ``If they can sell it for $500 million, they should do it.
We'd be thrilled. Because whoever could pay $500 million for it
could really do something incredible with the island.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Carolyn B. Maloney, a Manhattan Democrat, said: ``They are
trying to plug a hole in the budget. But this is a fraudulent way
to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   But other officials said the committee's actions were troubling
because they signaled an unwillingness among many members of
Congress to give the island to New York City. In 1995, President
Clinton told New York Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan that he would be
willing to help in an effort to transfer the island to the city for
$1, provided state and city officials could come up with an
acceptable plan for it.
</P>
<P>
   A commission appointed by Mayor Rudolph Giuliani is expected to
release a plan for the island, a former Coast Guard station, in the
coming months. Ideas include a mixture of park land, university
housing and commercial space. Any plan would have to preserve the
historic buildings and fortifications on the island, which is just
off the southern tip of Manhattan. The island was an Army post from
the 1790s to the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   Tony Bullock, chief of staff for Moynihan, said the senator
would try to kill the measure on the Senate floor. If that effort
fails, the bill could also be blocked in the House or removed
during budget negotiations between the two chambers later this
year.
</P>
<P>
   Levine said the Budget Committee's move provided evidence that
New York state needs a Republican senator, asserting that a member
of the Senate majority could have blocked the bill. Giuliani, a
Republican, is considering running for the Senate next year. The
state's two Senators, Moynihan and Charles E. Schumer, are
Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   But Bullock scoffed at that assertion. ``This stuff goes on all
the time here,'' he said. ``The island is a big 180-acre target
floating out there in the harbor.''

FURIOUS LAKERS FALL FLAT IN PHILLY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ One piece away from championship contention a
week ago, in pieces today, the Lakers near the end of their road
trip with nothing but losses and question marks to show for 3,500
miles of travel.
</P>
<P>
   Nine straight wins have given way to two straight losses, three
in four games, the latest a 105-90 pounding by the Philadelphia
76ers on Friday. So infuriating was the defeat, it sent the Lakers'
coach into a near-confrontation with a mouthy fan, and sent players
into a frenzy of self-blame.
</P>
<P>
   And now the questions burn: Where did their defense go? Why the
inconsistent offense? Who's to blame? Did Dennis Rodman really mean
that much to their winning streak? In short, what the heck
happened?
</P>
<P>
   Leave it to the man known as ``The Answer'' to provide one.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they need Rodman,'' Allen Iverson volunteered, after
torching the Lakers for 41 points. ``I see some chaos in their
team. I won't elaborate.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, even The Answer has to keep a few in reserve. Or maybe he
was just too tired to keep giving answers after answering the
challenge for four quarters against the Lakers. In a simply
spectacular display of his skills, Iverson shot the ball a
career-high 36 times and converted 17 of them for a sizzling 47.2
percent success rate.
</P>
<P>
   He scored off screens and on pick-and-rolls, in traffic and in
the open court, from short range and long distance, on drives and
spot-up jumpers, crossing over Kobe Bryant, Derek Harper and
whoever else was in his path.
</P>
<P>
   Iverson's new a.k.a. should be MVP.
</P>
<P>
   ``They gave the ball to Allen Iverson,'' said coach Kurt Rambis,
asked what the Sixers did to take over the game. ``He was just
drilling everything.''
</P>
<P>
   And the Lakers, as per usual on this six-game road trip, were
unable to respond. Rambis said their erratic defense had improved,
yet for the second straight night the Lakers gave up 100 points and
allowed 49.4 percent shooting.
</P>
<P>
   Harper blamed himself. Bryant volunteered, too. Others should
have.
</P>
<P>
   ``As the point guard, I take a lot of responsibility for those
two losses (to Cleveland and Philadelphia),'' Harper said. ``We got
stagnant on offense and I just didn't get what we needed to get
sometimes.''
</P>
<P>
   Defensively, there was just no stopping Iverson. Bryant failed
that test.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew how I wanted to guard him,'' Bryant said, ``but I just
wasn't prepared for pick-and-roll situations. That's it. It was
just my fault for not being prepared. It won't happen again.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite having the league's best shooter (Glen Rice) and
field-goal percentage leader (Shaquille O'Neal), the Lakers shot
40.8 percent _ 27.8 percent in the second half. Worse, the
Rodman-less Lakers were killed on the boards 46-34, and O'Neal
grabbed just four.
</P>
<P>
   And while O'Neal and Bryant scored 23 points each, they also
coughed up five turnovers apiece to account for half of the Lakers'
20 turnovers.
</P>
<P>
   ``They played well,'' O'Neal said of the Sixers. ``I don't think
they really beat us. We pretty much beat ourselves . . . taking
ill-advised shots.''
</P>
<P>
   The collapse came in phases, first in a second-quarter collapse
in which the Lakers squandered a 10-point lead, then in a
third-quarter meltdown in which the Sixers used an 18-6 run to take
a double-digit lead that effectively put the game away.
</P>
<P>
   Rambis found it tough to take. He stomped. He paced to halfcourt
and back. He crumpled up stat sheets.
</P>
<P>
   And in the waning seconds, he nearly lost his cool, exchanging
words with a heckler, who he heatedly told, ``Say something
intelligent. Say something intelligent.'' The fan kept at it,
Rambis walked behind the bench and took a step toward him, stopping
when assistant coach Chris Bodaken intervened.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a competitive person. I don't like to lose,'' Rambis said
of his frustration. But of the incident with the fan, he said only,
``We'll leave that one alone.''
</P>
<P>
   He was not alone in his fury.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a tough loss. Without a doubt,'' Harper said. ``But you
gotta keep going.''

PRO-WHITE GROUP PUTS REPUBLICANS ON HOT SEAT  
 POLITICAL MUSIC MAN  
 TAKING AIM AT NATIONAL SECURITY  
 COMPENSATING LANDOWNERS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ark., Fla., Miss., Ga., N.C., Ohio, Ala., La.)  (mk)

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A self-described ``pro-white'' group with roots in
the South is generating a fuss on Capitol Hill, where some
lawmakers, mostly Democrats, want to condemn it as racist.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is that several Republican lawmakers have ties to
the Council of Conservative Citizens and the GOP leadership doesn't
seem particularly enthusiastic about a congressional
tongue-lashing. In fact, they seem to wish the whole matter would
simply disappear.
</P>
<P>
   Fat chance.
</P>
<P>
   So far, 138 House members, including just 11 Republicans, have
endorsed a resolution condemning the council. Critics cite the
writings of some CCC members, who deride the intelligence of blacks
and warn against marriage between the races, as evidence of the
group's bigoted views.
</P>
<P>
   But only one Southern Republican, Rep. Jay Dickey of Arkansas,
has joined the condemnation effort.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Robert Wexler, D-Fla., a chief sponsor of the resolution,
hopes more lawmakers will sign on.
</P>
<P>
   ``Congress and the American people must not remain silent,''
Wexler said.
</P>
<P>
   But Republicans are embarrassed by the fact that lawmakers such
as Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., and Rep. Bob Barr,
R-Ga., spoke before state chapters of the council. Pressed about
their appearances, both men said they did not agree with all of the
views of the council members.
</P>
<P>
   House leaders won't say if they will bring the resolution to the
floor for a vote. And a spokesman for Lott said it would be unfair
to condemn the entire group for the opinions of a few. A competing
resolution making the rounds of Republican offices would condemn
all racism, without citing the CCC.
</P>
<P>
   But one prominent conservative activist, Arianna Huffington,
called on Republicans to take a stronger public stand against such
groups.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is nothing more immoral ... than playing footsie with
racists,'' Huffington said. ``This is at the heart of the
caricature about the Republican Party, that it does not care about
minorities.''
</P>
<P>
   MUSIC MAN
</P>
<P>
   There they were, some of America's top music stars from the
1950s and 1960s _Mary Wilson of the Supremes, Bowzer of Sha Na Na,
Sam Moore of Sam and Dave _ and Rep. Howard Coble, the rumpled
Republican of North Carolina?
</P>
<P>
   The musical artists descended on Capitol Hill to lobby for a
bill that would grant them new performing rights and stronger
trademark protection from competing copycat groups.
</P>
<P>
   Coble can't sing, but he presides over the House subcommittee
with jurisdiction over copyright law, so he provided back-up of
sorts at the press conference, promising to help get the bill
passed. The ``Truth in Rock Act'' is sponsored by Dennis Kucinich,
D-Ohio, whose Cleveland district includes the Rock 'n' Roll Hall of
Fame, and Charlie Norwood, R-Ga.
</P>
<P>
   Coble recalled that he did sing last year in his office when
some artists came to his office asking for help. ``No agents
knocked on my door,'' Coble said of his rendition of ``Charlie
Brown.''
</P>
<P>
   FOR THE DEFENSE
</P>
<P>
   Burned by their failed drive to oust President Clinton from
office over the Monica Lewinsky scandal, Republicans are zeroing in
on what many consider a far bigger problem with this White House _
national security.
</P>
<P>
   Southerners, who have long prided themselves on their emphasis
on national defense matters, are in the front lines. Many,
including some Democrats, are blasting the Clinton administration
for its handling of a possible espionage case at Los Alamos
National Laboratory, suggesting it indicates a lax attitude about
security matters. Critics say the FBI took too long to investigate
a scientist suspected of passing warhead design secrets to the
Chinese.
</P>
<P>
   Citing ``an institutional disregard for security at our national
labs,' Sen. Richard Shelby, R-Ala., chairman of the Senate Select
Committee on Intelligence, called on the administration to halt
visits to American nuclear research labs by scientists from
sensitive countries.
</P>
<P>
   ENVIRONMENTAL CONFLICT
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to the Endangered Species Act, opponents of the
federal law say what is good for the goose should be good for the
gander.
</P>
<P>
   Noting that a federal agency was recently paid $26 million to
absorb some impacts on threatened wildlife from a Minneapolis
airport expansion, they likewise want private landowners
financially compensated when they are forced to make accommodations
for wildlife deemed in danger of extinction.
</P>
<P>
   ``Positive incentives always work better than a gun-to-the-head
approach,'' said Rep. Billy Tauzin, R-La., a longtime foe of the
Clinton administration's approach to species issues.
</P>
<P>
   Private landowners are not now compensated if the government
places restrictions on the use of their land to protect endangered
species, a fact that galls property rights groups. But the new
proposal is likely to draw considerable fire from conservation
groups that want even tighter restrictions on private property that
is home to rare plants and wildlife.

BRYANT LOSES PHILLY STAKE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ Kobe Bryant's home-sweet-homecomings are becoming
bittersweet affairs.
</P>
<P>
   Bryant starred at Lower Merion High School, but the locals treat
him harshly now that he's a Southern California guy. He was razzed
by fans and torched by the Sixers on Friday and has now lost two
straight in his home town.
</P>
<P>
   A day earlier, Bryant was all smiles as he spoke of filling a
First Union Center luxury box with his friends and family for the
occasion of his annual return. He was talking cheesesteaks and
grandma's breakfasts.
</P>
<P>
   After Friday's loss, the Lakers' third straight to the Sixers in
two seasons, Bryant was smiling, but the expression was a bit
strained.
</P>
<P>
   ``It definitely upsets me,'' he said. ``I definitely don't want
to lose at home to Philly. But I'm gonna be in this league for
another 20 years. I'm not gonna lose three more.''
</P>
<P>
   He could if Allen Iverson scores 41 every time. The head-to-head
matchup of Philly's favorite son against its new adopted hero had
local reporters buzzing. But Bryant wouldn't take the bait.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really don't look at it as a me-and-Al matchup,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Someone told him Iverson had said he would always beat Bryant on
the perimeter but that Bryant would always win down low. Bryant
laughed and smiled and refused to get into the debate. The question
finally came: Who wins one-on-one?
</P>
<P>
   Another laugh.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll let y'all decide that,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   __ Worm watch: No news on Dennis Rodman on Friday except for
adamant denials from the team and Rodman's public relations firm
about a Daily News report that he was in Cancun. The only thing
clear right now is the Lakers need an infusion of energy,
particularly on defense and rebounding, and Rodman could bring both
when he returns.
</P>
<P>
   That could happen by Sunday's game at Orlando. It can't be soon
enough. In four games this week, the Lakers have lost the
rebounding battle twice and tied twice.
</P>
<P>
   ``We definitely want him back, without a doubt,'' Bryant said.
``The game we played tonight, we definitely could have used him on
the boards. I don't want to say we need it, but it definitely
helps.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Shaquille O'Neal: ``He'll be back. And we'll be back on
track.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Historically bad: The Sixers' 15-point margin of victory
Friday was their largest over the Lakers since a 113-93 win on
March 15, 1978. The Sixers have won three straight meetings for the
first time since a streak from March 1982 to January 1983.

SENATORS TIP OVER STARS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MIKE HEIKA 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ A tip of the goal last night gave the Stars their worst
slump of the season.
</P>
<P>
   But looking at the play on the ice, you'd never be able to tell.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars had a third-period Tony Hrkac goal disallowed because
the net had tipped off of its base, and lost a 2-1 game to the
Ottawa Senators.
</P>
<P>
   The loss meant the Stars had strung together two consecutive
defeats for only the third time this season and it created their
longest winless drought at four games (0-2-2). Even so, the Stars
outshot the Senators, 32-14, including 13-1 in the third period.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought the game lived up to its billing,'' Stars coach Ken
Hitchcock said of the high-speed affair that between the teams with
the NHL's best records.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars fall to 42-14-12 (96 points) but remain nine points
ahead of the Eastern Conference-leading Senators (39-20-9) in the
quest for the Presidents' Trophy, given to the team with the best
regular-season record.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to see where we're at, so it was a big game from
that standpoint,'' Senators coach Jacques Martin said. ``Dallas has
a lot more experience than us, but we're learning as we go.''
</P>
<P>
   The Stars felt they had worked hard enough for at least a tie,
but were denied when Hrkac had a goal taken away at the 11:44 mark
of the third period because the net had tilted forward and was off
its base when the puck went in. Stars winger Grant Marshall worked
hard to get a puck from Rhodes behind the net and fed Hrkac in the
right circle for an easy shot into an open net. In his haste to
return to the front of the net, Rhodes ran into his own defenseman
Lance Pitlick and fell down, pulling the net forward for a second.
</P>
<P>
   NHL rules state a goal cannot be scored if the net is not in
place, unless a player from the defending team ``intenionally''
knocks the net from its moorings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Was it deliberate? No, I don't think it was,'' referee Paul
Devorski said. ``If it was deliberate, yeah, we could have awarded
a goal. But in that case, the net wasn't sitting down when the puck
went across the line, so we can't allow it.''
</P>
<P>
   Simply put, it was bad luck for the Stars.
</P>
<P>
   ``They caught a break,'' Hitchcock said. ``That's the fine line
when you've got two good teams going at it. They needed that break
at that time, because we were pretty well all over them.''
</P>
<P>
   The Stars rolled onto the ice in the first period with the
intention of getting their forecheck in hard and pushing their
defensemen up into the play. They did just that, swarming the
Senators, getting two power-play chances and scoring on one when
Darryl Sydor deflected in a Mike Modano shot at the 7:16 mark of
the first period.
</P>
<P>
   But in the process of pushing so hard to the Senators' net, the
Stars left themselves uncovered defensively. The speedy Senators
took advantage for several outmanned rushes and strong scoring
chances on Stars goalie Ed Belfour.
</P>
<P>
   The key chance came in the final 30 seconds of the first period
with the line of Joe Nieuwendyk, Pat Verbeek and Jamie
Langenbrunner on the ice. Sergei Zubov got caught in a scrum along
the right boards and no forward rotated back to help cover. That
left the Stars facing a 2-on-1 and Andreas Dackell bounced in a
crossing pass off Sydor with 19.8 seconds remaining in the period.
</P>
<P>
   The Senators grabbed that momentum and capitalized in the second
period, again outhustling the line of Nieuwendyk, Langenbrunner and
Verbeek. This time, winger Steve Martins carried the turnover up
ice and behind the Stars net, feeding out to Marian Hossa in the
slot, who had beat the check of Nieuwendyk to the net and flicked
in his 11th goal.
</P>
<P>
   That turned out to be the game-winner when Hrkac's goal was
disallowed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We battled hard, we worked hard, we had lots of scoring
chances,'' Hitchcock said. ``But you know what, we have to finish
those chances.''

MIAMI,SZCZERBIAK CAN'T SLOW KENTUCKY

<TEXT>
<P>
   ST LOUIS _ In a Midwest Regional engagement between Miami and
Kentucky on Friday night, a familiar sociological struggle
re-emerged.
</P>
<P>
   Man against machine, with the usual results.
</P>
<P>
   Miami's Wally Szczerbiak concluded his amazing experience in the
NCAA Tournament, leaving little doubt among 42,440 patrons at the
Trans World Dome that he is among the nation's finest players.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, Kentucky (28-8) left little doubt that it is among
the finest teams, rolling methodically to a 58-43 victory and a
date with Michigan State in Sunday's regional final.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wally is a great player, but we had a great team performance
today,'' said Kentucky coach Tubby Smith. ``The bench really came
through for us _ we got help from a lot of people.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could kind of see it when they hit the wall in the second
half. I think we kind of wore Wally down finally.''
</P>
<P>
   Szczerbiak finished with 23 points _ giving him 90 for three
tournament games. But for Miami (24-8), he was almost the whole
show. His supporting cast was overwhelmed by Kentucky's depth and
towering front line.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had a great run,'' Miami coach Charlie Coles said. ``But
when Scott Padgett started hitting threes in the second half, it
was a little too much for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Padgett, who finished with 17 points, capped a 10-0 run midway
through the second half that finished the RedHawks, who fell
behind, 45-28, with little hope of recovery. The Wildcats' lead
eventually reached 19 points.
</P>
<P>
   The Wildcats finished with a 37-18 advantage on the boards.
Excluding Szczerbiak, the RedHawks were 6-of-28 from the field.
</P>
<P>
   If third-seeded Kentucky can win again Sunday against a
top-seeded Michigan State team that has thus far been victorious
but unimpressive, the Wildcats will secure their fourth consecutive
trip to the Final Four. nn

ST. JOHN'S-OHIO STATE IS BATTLE OF BACKCOURTS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MIKE JONES 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   KNOXVILLE, Tenn. _ St. John's coach Mike Jarvis is not queasy
about his wishes regarding what he would like to see happen to Ohio
State's guards before they face his team tonight in the South
Regional championship game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish \RScoonie Penn and Michael Redd\S would go to the same
restaurant \RRon Artest\S went to the other night and that they
would fall over ``both'' beds in their rooms,'' Jarvis said.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Storm coach was referring to the sequence of events of
earlier in the week when his star guard-forward slightly injured
his ankle while attempting to get to the bathroom in the middle of
the night after eating what Artest termed, ``some nasty food.''
</P>
<P>
   But that was only one of the ways Jarvis expressed his
appreciation _ backhanded though it may have been _ for the Buckeye
counterparts to the Red Storm's Erick Barkley and Bootsy Thornton.
And Jarvis did not mince words when it comes to the long-held
theory that teams with the best guards usually advance in the NCAA
Tournament.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is guard time, when the guards step up,'' Jarvis said.
``Ohio State has as good a backcourt as there is in all the United
States of America. It's going to be a great matchup. Our guys who
play against them are going to have their work cut out for them.''
</P>
<P>
   Barkley and Thornton combined for 41 points in St. John's 76-62
semifinal victory over Maryland. Penn and Redd connected for 48 in
Ohio State's 72-64 win over top-seeded Auburn.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both Barkley and Thornton are very good scorers who can get to
the bucket,'' Buckeyes' coach Jim O'Brien said. ``Barkley has
tremendous quickness and is good \Ron the dribble\S with either
hand. Thornton can put points on the board. Didn't he get 40
against Duke?
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to have to do a really good job of knowing where
they are and not giving them a lot of space. But the thing I like
is the way they pass the ball. They have a lot of players who are
good with the ball and are unselfish players.''
</P>
<P>
   The focal matchup will be between Penn and Barkley.
</P>
<P>
   ``Neither team would be here without them,'' Jarvis said. ``In
Scoonie and Erick, you have two of the best in the country. And you
cannot get to the point we're at without a great point guard.
</P>
<P>
   ``And the main thing that makes them great is, team and winning
come first. They believe they can win every game they play.''
</P>
<P>
   Penn, a 5-foot-10 scooter, has 142 assists to 94 turnovers. He
set a school record with 83 successful 3-point shots while
averaging 16.9 points a game. The 6-1 Barkley passed out 168
assists against 76 turnovers, made 56 3-pointers and averaged 13.5
points.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a chance to watch Erick several times this season on
TV,'' Penn said. ``He does a great job of running their team. He's
the leader, the guy who gets them going. It's going to be a good
matchup, one that should be fun to watch.''
</P>
<P>
   Redd, who averages a team-leading 19.6 points and has 77
assists, said it's not unusual for the Buckeyes to face this kind
of challenge.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've played against great guards all year long in the Big 10,
so this is nothing new,'' he said. ``But St. John's does have great
guards and this will be a challenge to us.''
</P>
<P>
   There is always the possibility that other things will determine
which team advances to the Final Four.
</P>
<P>
   ``If those combinations neutralize each other,'' Jarvis noted.
``It may go to which team has the best frontcourt. And that's how
the game may unfold.''

GALAXY MIGHT OPEN WITHOUT CIENFUEGOS

<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ Galaxy coach Octavio Zambrano said late
Friday that Mauricio Cienfuegos met with league officials to
discuss his contract dispute with Major League Soccer, but he won't
know until this morning if the three-time All-Star will be with the
Galaxy for tonight's season opener against Colorado at the Rose
Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Cienfuegos, a holdout since training camp began in February,
joined the team Tuesday in what he called a ``good faith'' effort,
hoping to increase his chances for a substantial raise to his
$103,000 contract.
</P>
<P>
   Cienfuegos met with Ivan Gazidis, executive vice president of
player relations for the MLS, in the office of his agent, Corey
Clemetson, but Clemetson said the meeting ``didn't go well.''
</P>
<P>
   Clemetson said Cienfuegos told him and Univision that he and
fellow countryman Raul Diaz Arce, a holdout with San Jose, would
not play tonight.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mauricio stated that as of right now he's not playing,''
Clemetson said. ``He felt the offer (by the league) didn't make
sense for him. He's very disappointed but sticking with what he
said, which is not to play.''
</P>
<P>
   Cienfuegos will meet with MLS commissioner Doug Logan this
morning without Clemetson in hopes of securing an agreement before
tonight's 7:30 match. But Clemetson said an agreement is unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   ``His meeting with Logan isn't a negotiation,'' Clemetson said.
``They are getting together to discuss his situation ... but who
knows? If things change in less than a 24-hour period, maybe he
would reconsider, but right now he's decided not to play on
Saturday.''
</P>
<P>
   Cienfuegos threatened on Tuesday that if a contract wasn't
worked out, he would fly back to his native El Salvador.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think something positive will come out of this meeting
tomorrow,'' an optimistic Zambrano said. ``If he signs he will
play, obviously. If he doesn't, I'm not sure what's going to
happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Clemetson said he's not sure what Cienfuegos will do.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fair thing to say is I don't know,'' Clemetson said.
``Right now, Mauricio is very upset. I think a number of things can
happen, but we'll just have to wait and see.''

SPORTS COLUMN: A CHATTY EL-AMIN BACKING IT UP 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ Jim Calhoun is built like one of those enforcers who
used to protect Bob Cousy in the old days. His speech is
unadulterated Boston corner boy. But he looks at Khalid El-Amin, an
Orthodox Muslim point guard from Minneapolis, with body by
Teletubbies, and he sees a kindred soul.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can relate to Khalid more than almost any other player I've
ever had,'' Calhoun said. ``Even down to getting the hungry
horrors.''
</P>
<P>
   The hungry horrors?
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, you know, when you're starving at 11 o'clock at night,''
Calhoun explained.
</P>
<P>
   They share another hunger _ the desire to verbalize, to explain,
to put their stamp on everything around them. They are so much
alike that Calhoun must sometimes tell El-Amin to just button it
up, leave it alone. Quiet!
</P>
<P>
   Calhoun and his roly-poly henchman must beat Gonzaga Saturday to
send Connecticut to the Final Four for the first time in school
history.
</P>
<P>
   There is a decade of frustration, which Calhoun sought to end by
recruiting El-Amin, even though Connecticut already had point
guards galore. The coach also had to come to grips with El-Amin's
buttery 5-foot-10-inch, 203-pound body, which was no more likely to
shape up than his penchant for verbosity.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people were not going to allow me to play my game,
but he took a chance on me,'' El-Amin said Thursday night, after
leading Connecticut to a bruising 78-68 victory over Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   El-Amin, a sophomore, seems fearless, projecting his
human-bowling-ball body into the air at oblique angles and tossing
up soft shots off the backboard. He often leads with his lip,
yapping and gesticulating, as he did Thursday, when he nearly
touched off a melee.
</P>
<P>
   Just before the half ended, he watched Jess Settles, a truculent
sixth-year senior for Iowa, burrow his forehead into the forehead
of Connecticut's Edmund Saunders, the two of them trading baleful
Sonny Liston-type scowls.
</P>
<P>
   This struck El-Amin as hilarious. As Iowa went to shoot a free
throw, El-Amin made running commentary, acting like the
prototypical schoolyard agitator, his expressive face ranging from
chortles to smirks, as if to say, ``I can't believe that your guy
thinks he can beat up on my guy.''
</P>
<P>
   El-Amin's remarks annoyed Joey Range of Iowa. A few seconds
later, as the teams headed for their respective locker rooms, Range
stuck out his arm _ reached down, actually, being seven inches
taller than El-Amin _ and clotheslined him by his stubby little
neck. Needless to say, more words were exchanged.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him I didn't appreciate that,'' El-Amin said.
</P>
<P>
   Calhoun did not appreciate El-Amin's stoking Iowa, which was
already setting a tone with flying-Wallenda rebounds, elbows
flailing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told them, anybody who talks is going to have a seat next to
me,'' Calhoun said later. ``I told them to shut up. Just shut up.''
</P>
<P>
   This is hard for Calhoun to do, he admits.
</P>
<P>
   ``Khalid and I are both nonstop personalities,'' Calhoun said.
``I am 63-7 with him. We are in the NCAA's with him. He's one of
the great ones.''
</P>
<P>
   Calhoun has felt this way about El-Amin since his recruiting
visit to Minneapolis, where El-Amin was already something of a
celebrity. He was married with child, had the state map tattooed on
his left bicep, and was not necessarily the perfect fit.
</P>
<P>
   Calhoun took him to Connecticut for a visit, and El-Amin found
his way to the gym for a workout with incumbent players.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was this guy screaming and yelling,'' recalled the
senior Ricky Moore, the starting point guard at the time. ``Guys
were saying, `Who is this kid?' ''
</P>
<P>
   Given El-Amin's shape and his mouth and his aspirations, Moore
said: ``I could easily have said, `This isn't the place for you.'
But we have a lot of guys who are competitive, and we want the best
team possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Calhoun, in the meantime, uttered the magic words, ``start as a
freshman,'' to El-Amin. This has forced Moore to play the off guard
position, but the players quickly accepted El-Amin, and laughed at
his adventures.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a game at Virginia when we were taking layups and
this guy asked me if I was hungry,'' El-Amin recalled. ``I said I
wasn't, but he held out a pizza box and said I'd be hungry by
halftime.''
</P>
<P>
   Early this season, the fans in Pittsburgh were getting quite
personal, and when El-Amin's late shot beat the home team, he
jumped on a press table and crowed.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, fans were calling him ``Idi Amin,'' but he laughed
that off, too. He has that glow of a man on a hot streak, the way
Keith Smart did before firing the winning jumper for Indiana in
1987 and Rumeal Robinson did before making the two epic free throws
for Michigan in 1989. They were both bright guys who had been
around, and were not in awe of the tournament.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basketball is an exciting game,'' El-Amin said. ``You've got
to have fun playing it. You give 110 percent, sure, but it's got to
be fun. The crowd calls me `fat boy,' that gives me motivation. I
just laugh it off.''
</P>
<P>
   He takes the incoming fire. At news conferences, the Connecticut
players defer to their chubby teammate. They know he wants the
microphone _ and the basketball.  &QL;

AFTER ROUTING PURDUE, TEMPLE FACES DUKE 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ The Temple Owls turned two Purdue
technical fouls into a 10-point swing on Friday and had one of
their best shooting performances of the year to drum the
Boilermakers, 77-55, and reach the East Regional final.
</P>
<P>
   It will be Temple's fourth appearance in the final eight in 11
years and a rematch of the 1987 game that the Owls lost to Duke,
63-53. The sixth-seeded Owls were down by 11-10 when Purdue guard
Jaraan Cornell and then Coach Gene Keady were slapped with
technical fouls. Cornell was caught retaliating in a scuffle with
Temple's Quincy Wadley, and Keady argued the call.
</P>
<P>
   The Owls made five free throws, a shot in the lane and a
3-pointer to go ahead by 20-10. But it was the Owls' 52.7 percent
shooting that kept the 10th-seeded Boilermakers from leading again.
``Those things happen,'' said Keady, whose team shot 45.2 percent
and finished 21-13. ``We could never sustain anything from there.''
</P>
<P>
   The Owls (24-10) were led by Mark Karcher, who had 21 points,
including 15 from beyond the 3-point line. Karcher, who scored a
combined 11 points in victories against Kent and Cincinnati, was 8
of 17 from the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last two games I wasn't aggressive on offense,'' said the
sophomore forward. ``I told myself I was going to come out and take
the open shot. ''
</P>
<P>
   Temple's match-up zone frustrated the Boilermakers, who were
outrebounded by 31-23 and outscored on second-chance points by
20-6. They committed 20 turnovers that led to 36 points for the
Owls, while Temple's back court of Pepe Sanchez and Rasheed
Brokenborough took care of the ball and combined for 25 points.
</P>
<P>
   ``We played very tough defense and I'm pleased with that,'' said
Temple Coach John Chaney. ``We can never count on our offense to be
that good, but our kids will always play defense.'' &QL;

KENTUCKY AGAINST SZCZERBIAK IS NO CONTEST 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By JACK CURRY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS _ Wally Szczerbiak could not rescue Miami of Ohio one
more time. He could not keep his and Miami's magical journey
through March alive, not by himself. That is really what it
amounted to Friday night as Szczerbiak and four sometimes-invisible
teammates fought Kentucky and lost, 58-43. The matchup was a
mismatch.
</P>
<P>
   Szczerbiak was the premier player on the court, but Scott
Padgett was almost his equal, and the third-seeded Wildcats proved
that they were the premier team with just enough defense and more
than enough depth to outlast the one-dimensional RedHawks. It was
an awful experience for 10th-seeded Miami, which could have made
the game much more interesting if someone not named Szczerbiak
occasionally slashed to the hoop or drilled a jumper.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just trying to do whatever it took to keep us in the
game,'' Szczerbiak said. ``Unfortunately, it wasn't enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just wanted to do whatever it took to win. The zone they
played, it seemed like no one had an answer for it. There was
nothing tactical we could do. When they stick those long arms out,
it's tough.''
</P>
<P>
   So it was the team with the best players, not the team with the
best player, that marched through the semifinals of the West
Regional to oppose Michigan State on Sunday. Padgett had 17 points
for the Wildcats, including 14 in the second half and 12 during one
stretch that broke Miami's back.
</P>
<P>
   If the defending national champions beat the Spartans, the
Wildcats (28-8) will reach the hallowed Final Four for the fourth
straight season and will be trying to win their third title in that
time. Szczerbiak finished his college career with 23 points, but
only 8 after intermission.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew Wally was going to get his points,'' Padgett said.
``We wanted to play good team defense and make other people make
plays for them. I know this is crazy to say, but he only got 16
shots. I guess we limited him a little.''
</P>
<P>
   Padgett and Jamaal Magloire defended him physically, and the
Wildcats were more willing to let him shoot jumpers than to let him
drive. Szczerbiak, who did not force shots even as it became
apparent that he was Miami's only option, went 8 for 16 from the
field. The other players on Miami (24-8) were an unsightly 6 for
28, and that included two irrelevant field goals in the last 90
seconds.
</P>
<P>
   After Damon Frierson, Szczerbiak's sidekick, finally drilled a
3-pointer to chop the deficit to 35-28 with his first points,
Kentucky got serious. Padgett made four free throws, stole the ball
from Szcerbiak, hit two 3-pointers and another jumper. When the
slaughter had finally ended for Miami, Padgett had 12 points during
a 14-4 streak and the Wildcats led, 49-32.
</P>
<P>
   ``Padgett got those threes in,'' said Miami Coach Charlie Coles.
``I thought he hit some key shots. Once he did that, they did a
marvelous job on defense. ''
</P>
<P>
   Padgett pumped his fist against his chest after the game-turning
run. No one could save Miami anymore, not even Szczerbiak. As
Padgett celebrated, Szczerbiak's eyes were on his sneakers. He knew
his season and his college career were over. The best player had
lost. The best team had won.
</P>
<P>
   Other than being rather low-scoring, the first half played out
as expected. Kentucky led Miami, 26-19, and Szczerbiak led Miami
with 15 points. It was the one-man team against the team with 10
men, and the Wildcats could not stop Wally, but that did not stop
them from scooting to the lead. Saul Smith climaxed the first half
with a double pump 3-pointer at the buzzer for Kentucky and then
inadvertently knocked over Miami's red hawk mascot as he rumbled to
the locker room.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone wanted to see Szczerbiak. Even Kentucky's players were
intrigued and determined about playing the sweet shooter known as
Wally World. The Wildcats surged to a 4-0 lead on Scott Padgett's
dunk and Wayne Turner's jumper, but Szczerbiak buried a 3-pointer
the first time he touched the ball. After Heshimu Evans converted a
layup, Szczerbiak drilled an 18-footer to make it 6-5. It was the
second time he had touched the ball. There was electricity in the
building.
</P>
<P>
   But then it disappeared, along with Miami. Kentucky methodically
reeled off 10 straight points. In 11 consecutive possessions the
RedHawks went 0 for 9 from the field and had two turnovers.
Szczerbiak was 0 for 3 with 1 turnover during the eight and a half
minute drought. The Kentucky fans, who were boisterous and
outfitted in blue, derisively chanted, ``Wall-eee, Wall-eee,'' as
the lead expanded to 16-5.
</P>
<P>
   With 8:55 left in the half and Miami standing still against
Kentucky's man to man defense, Szczerbiak finally ended the lengthy
drought by taking a step back and swishing another 3-pointer. It
was 16-8 and Szczerbiak had all of Miami's points. It was looking
more and more obvious that Miami needed Szczerbiak to have an
awesome game to stay in the game.
</P>
<P>
   Even though Miami sputtered and did not receive points from
someone other than Szczerbiak until Anthony Taylor's two free
throws with 6:22 remaining, the Wildcats did not pin the RedHawks.
Kentucky's largest advantage was 19-10 and that immediately shrunk
when Szczerbiak scored 5 straight points.
</P>
<P>
   The RedHawks trimmed the deficit to 21-17 on Rob Mestas' basket
with 2:50 left in the half, the first field goal by a player other
than Szczerbiak. But Kentucky did not allow Szczerbiak University
to get any closer than that. While Szczerbiak was 5 for 9 from the
field, his vanishing teammates were a gory 1 for 12. Damon
Frierson, who averages 13.1 points a game, and John Estick, who
scores 8.5, were a combined 0 for 6 from the field with no points.
The RedHawks had Wally and almost nothing else, which is why the
Wildcats had the edge. &QL;

HOW TV PLANTED SEEDS OF MADNESS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVID A. MARKIEWICZ 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Television's influential role in sport past, present and future
is the underlying theme of HBO's latest episode of ``Real Sports
With Bryant Gumbel'', which airs at 9 p.m. Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The first three segments of the hourlong program focus on a
college basketball game played in Houston 31 years ago, the raging
economic disparity among Major League Baseball franchises and the
mystery that is Dick Vitale.
</P>
<P>
   Other than Dicky V, the connection between the subjects and the
television industry seems tenuous. But as the program shows,
neither college basketball nor baseball's financial ills would be
what they are without television. Neither, of course, would Vitale.
</P>
<P>
   The basketball game profiled is what a lot of observers regard
as the greatest ever played, the Houston-UCLA matchup on Jan. 20,
1968. That night the No. 2 Cougars, led by Elvin Hayes, upset Lew
Alcindor's top-ranked Bruins.
</P>
<P>
   The game was the first ever in college basketball to be
broadcast live nationally to a prime-time viewing audience.
Previously, even college basketball's national championship game
was aired on a tape-delayed basis. But unexpected interest in the
game helped an independent TV producer named Eddie Einhorn sell the
contest to 150 stations in 49 states.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was the night that pushed college basketball from the
independent producer into the eyes of the networks,'' Einhorn said.
``And the big sponsors.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the next year NBC bought TV rights to college
basketball. Neither the game nor TV has looked back since. So was
born the mania that eventually became March Madness.
</P>
<P>
   ``After all these years, it's probably the most important
telecast of my career,'' recalls Dick Enberg, who that night called
his first national broadcast.
</P>
<P>
   Considering how their sport has grown in popularity, NCAA
basketball advocates could say the same today.
</P>
<P>
   Television's influence on baseball's growing economic gap
between big market and small market clubs also is examined by HBO.
Kevin McClatchy, owner of the Pittsburgh Pirates, succinctly
identifies the problem by stating that the New York Yankees will
reap $55 million to $60 million this year in local cable TV rights
money while his club will earn closer to $3.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the difference right there,'' McClatchy states.
</P>
<P>
   One remedy that is offered: Don't allow rich clubs to televise
their road games played against poor franchises. That would
significantly cut into the rich clubs' revenue, perhaps forcing
them to accept greater revenue sharing.
</P>
<P>
   Don't expect Rangers owner Tom Hicks to pump his fist at that
suggestion, however. In an interview from Port Charlotte, Fla.,
Hicks tells HBO that revenue sharing isn't likely as long as rich
clubs like the Rangers have to pay for their own oversized
payrolls.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not going to share the good stuff and keep all the bad
stuff,'' Hicks states.
</P>
<P>
   Hicks does estimate that when his forthcoming regional sports
network is up and operating the club could generate about one-half
the Yankees' local TV haul, enough, presumably, to keep the Rangers
among the big boys of baseball.
</P>
<P>
   Ah, the power of television.
</P>
<P>
   Vitale, of course, would be nothing (at least not a celebrity)
without TV other than another fired coach. It's a piece of fortune
he clearly recognizes and for which he is obviously grateful.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm stealing money, baby, doing something I love,'' he tells
his interviewer, sympathizing with those who daily trudge to their
daily drudge. ``Please don't take it away from me.''

ST. JOHN'S PLAYERS FIND `ZONE' AFTER SWITCHING DEFENSES
</HEADLINE>
 NOTES-TEX (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MIKE JONES 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It is unusual for a coach to turn away from proven strategies
late in the season.
</P>
<P>
   Yet in effect, that's what St. John's coach Mike Jarvis has
done. After playing a zone defense only sparingly while forging a
28-8 record and an NCAA Tournament first-round victory over
Samford, Jarvis has switched to the mainstay of a zone defense.
</P>
<P>
   The zone debuted in the stunning 86-61 victory over Indiana that
got the Red Storm to the Sweet 16. It was most effective in
Thursday's victory over Maryland that got St. John's to tonight's
South championship game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes things work differently than you think,'' Jarvis
said. ``I remember before the Duke game (a 92-88 overtime loss Jan.
24), I said we're going to play some zone and if looks could kill,
they all would have killed me. I said, `Remember the first time we
met, I asked you to have faith and trust me.' They began to trust
me a little more as the year went along and began to understand why
I asked them to go to the zone. They're very intelligent players.
And it helps to have a positive experience. They're asking me to
play it now.''
</P>
<P>
   Jarvis, however, discounts strategies at this stage of the
tournament.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's about fresh minds and fresh legs,'' he said. COACHING
OVERRATED?
</P>
<P>
   Ohio State coach Jim O'Brien is one of many who thinks
television commentators and national basketball writers make too
much of coaching at this point of the tournament.
</P>
<P>
   ``No question about it,'' he said. ``And I've talked to our guys
about this. I really and truly believe we've lost sight of what
this is about.
</P>
<P>
   ``As someone who has played this game a little bit (Boston
College, the ABA), I never remember thinking about a coach having
any impact on games. In the age of all this exposure, a little too
much is made of coaches. You can lose sight that this is for the
guys who are playing and getting it done.'' MILESTONES
</P>
<P>
   Two St. John's players are likely to set school records tonight
against Ohio State. Guard Erick Barkley is 11 points short of tying
the mark for most points by a freshman (498), held jointly by Chris
Mullin and Felipe Lopez. Winger Ron Artest is one steal away from
Malik Sealy's school-record 75 steals in a season. As a team, the
Red Storm with 358 steals, breaking the mark of 310 set in 1990-91.
</P>
<P>
   Ohio State has also set a school record for steals at 287.
PORTER PLANS TO STAY
</P>
<P>
   Auburn's 6-foot-7 forward Chris Porter reiterated after Thursday
night's loss to St. John's that he would not opt to enter this
year's NBA draft and would return for next season.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I said before still holds,'' the Southeastern Conference
player of the year said. ``We accomplished a lot this year, but
there are still some things we want to accomplish next year. This
is a young team (with two seniors) but we're going to play our best
and do what we can.'' SPOTLIGHT
</P>
<P>
   James ``Scoonie'' Penn School Pos. Ht. Wt. Yr. St. John's G 5-10
185 Jr. Did you know? Penn was the Big East Conference rookie of
the year in 1996 while playing for Boston College. As a sophomore,
he led the Eagles to the Big East tournament championship and was
selected the tourney's MVP. He followed coach Jim O'Brien when
O'Brien left BC to take the Ohio State job. After sitting out last
season, Penn has helped the Buckeyes turn things around this
season.
</P>
<P>
   Why should you care? Because transfers aren't always malcontents
and sometimes do have success at a second school. ``The decision
took quite awhile,'' Penn said. ``I wasn't sure if wanted to leave
home (Salem, Mass.) I had two good years at BC. But I also knew
which way the program was headed, but I didn't know if I wanted be
part of it anymore. I just felt it was best for me to leave.'' nn

PALMEIRO EYES OPENING DAY START
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHNNY PAUL 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEARWATER, Fla. _ First baseman Rafael Palmeiro will be in the
Opening Day lineup if he appears in at least one exhibition game
before the Rangers return to Texas, manager Johnny Oates said
yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers' exhibition schedule also includes games April 2-3
with the Houston Astros and New York Mets at The Ballpark in
Arlington.
</P>
<P>
   ``That would give him at least three games, and that would be
plenty for me'' barring any setbacks, Oates said.
</P>
<P>
   Rangers trainer Danny Wheat told Oates on Thursday that Palmeiro
could return by next week. Palmeiro, who underwent arthroscopic
surgery March 7 to remove torn cartilage from his right knee,
continues to show significant progress from his rehabilitation.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. John Conway, the Rangers' orthopedic consultant, plans to
return to Port Charlotte, Fla., next week to examine Palmeiro,
Oates said.
PATTERSON ON TARGET
</P>
<P>
   Right-hander Danny Patterson required only 11 pitches for his
one-inning appearance yesterday against the Philadelphia Phillies.
</P>
<P>
   That is significant, Oates said.
</P>
<P>
   Patterson, whom Oates prefers to limit to one-inning
appearances, can pitch effectively on consecutive days when the
reliever does not extend himself beyond 20 pitches during an
appearance.
BRIEFLY
</P>
<P>
   Outfielder Milt Cuyler, who departed camp after Wednesday's game
to attend his grandfather's funeral, rejoined the Rangers for
yesterday's game and delivered a ninth-inning single as a pinch
hitter.
</P>
<P>
   Minor-league catcher Jason Torres joined the travel squad and
was used as an 11th-inning pinch hitter for right-hander Al Levine.
Phillies left-hander Billy Brewer retired Torres on strikes.
</P>
<P>
   Only several hundred tickets remain for the Rangers' Opening Day
game April 5 against Detroit at The Ballpark in Arlington. Tickets
can be purchased at The Ballpark or Dillard's ticket outlets, at
the Rangers' internet site (www.texasrangers.com), through area
electronic ticket machines or by calling the Rangers' ticket office

RANGERS LIKELY TO STAND PAT ON ROTATION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHNNY PAUL 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEARWATER, Fla. _ The Rangers appear set to begin this season
with a rotation built from their existing roster.
</P>
<P>
   Yesterday's performance by right-hander Esteban Loaiza may leave
those in the organization uncomfortable.
</P>
<P>
   Loaiza surrendered four runs (three earned) on four hits and two
walks during his three-inning appearance against the Philadelphia
Phillies, leaving him with a 7.04 earned-run average through 7 2/3
innings this spring.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing is, I haven't had a club call and tell me that it
has pitching available,'' general manager Doug Melvin said before
yesterday's game at Jack Russell Stadium. ``There are probably 22
to 24 clubs looking to upgrade their pitching, and there's just not
that many pitchers available.''
</P>
<P>
   That leaves Melvin with two alternatives _ Cleveland's Orel
Hershiser and Kansas City's Kevin Appier _ from outside the
organization.
</P>
<P>
   Neither thrills the Rangers, Melvin said.
</P>
<P>
   Hershiser can become a free agent tomorrow if the Indians do not
place the 40-year-old right-hander on their 40-man roster.
Hershiser pitched four scoreless innings Wednesday to improve his
ERA to 2.70 through 10 innings this spring.
</P>
<P>
   ``He looked like `The Bulldog' of old,'' Indians pitching coach
Phil Regan told reporters after a Hershiser appearance this week.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers don't appear to be so convinced of `The Bulldog's'
bite.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't made that final decision,'' Melvin said of
Hershiser. ``We'll talk to our people who have seen him.''
</P>
<P>
   Appier, whom the Royals want to trade to reduce their payroll,
appears to be less of a possibility.
</P>
<P>
   The 31-year-old right-hander, who this season will earn $4.9
million, pitched only 15 innings for the Royals last season after
undergoing arthroscopic surgery on his right shoulder a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Appier's contract also presents potential difficulties. His
salary will increase by $500,000 if he is traded this season, and
the contract also includes an option for the 2000 season.
</P>
<P>
   That means it could become a multiyear contract if an
organization exercises the option. As a player with five or more
years of major-league experience, Appier could demand to be traded
after being traded in the midst of a multiyear contract. Therefore,
an organization could part with prospects in a trade and retain
Appier only for the 1999 season.
</P>
<P>
   Right-hander Mike Morgan, the leading candidate to become the
Rangers' long reliever, could become a possibility for the
rotation. Morgan owns a 0.79 ERA and has limited opponents to a
.231 batting average (9-for-39) through 11 1/3 innings this spring.
However, Morgan averaged only 5 1/3 innings per start last season.
</P>
<P>
   Loaiza, 27, remains an enigma because his talent often exceeds
the results.
</P>
<P>
   ``He looked like he has all spring to me,'' manager Johnny Oates
said. ``He makes some quality pitches, and he makes some pitches
that aren't so good.''
</P>
<P>
   Loaiza will remain in the rotation until those results alter the
manager's decision, Oates said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mike Morgan is not going to change my mind,'' Oates said.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers likely would be interested in Oakland's Kenny
Rogers, Philadelphia's Curt Schilling and Minnesota's Brad Radke
should any of the three become available, but that will not be the
case before Opening Day, their respective general managers have
said repeatedly this spring.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things can change,'' Melvin said. ``It's still a little
early.''

PALMEIRO EYES START ON OPENING DAY

<P>
   CLEARWATER, Fla. _ First baseman Rafael Palmeiro will be in the
Opening Day lineup if he appears in at least one exhibition game
before the Rangers return to Texas, manager Johnny Oates said
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers' exhibition schedule also includes games April 2-3
with the Houston Astros and New York Mets at The Ballpark in
Arlington.
</P>
<P>
   ``That would give him at least three games, and that would be
plenty for me'' barring any setbacks, Oates said.

(12)
</P>
<P>
   Rangers right-hander Al Levine could not protect a ninth-inning
lead, and the two clubs agreed to halt the game after Rangers
left-hander Mike Venafro was hit on the right wrist by a
12th-inning line drive off the bat of Philadelphia's David Miller.
The Rangers lacked another available pitcher to complete the game.
John Blake, the Rangers' vice president of media relations, said
Venafro's wrist was bruised.
</P>
<P>
   At the plate: Center fielder Ruben Mateo went 1 for 3 to extend
his hitting streak to eight games and is hitting .474 with two home
runs and six runs batted in. Blake said Mateo slammed into an
outfield wall late in the game and bruised his right hand. He and
Venafro are listed as day-to-day.
</P>
<P>
   On the mound: Left-hander Tony Fossas, who allowed two hits and
one walk during his two-inning appearance, has pitched 3 2/3
consecutive scoreless innings.
</P>
<P>
   In the field: Shortstop Royce Clayton committed his fourth error
since Monday by failing to field a bad-hop ground ball off the bat
of Phillies left fielder Ron Gant.

GONZALEZ IS MONEY, SO GIVE HIM A BIG CHECK, NOW
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIM REEVES 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEARWATER, Fla. _ The crack of Juan Gonzalez's bat had the
ear-popping timbre of a rifle shot, and the baseball arched into
the blue Florida sky, climbing high and far beyond the fence in the
left-field power alley at Jack Russell Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at that,'' Rangers manager Johnny Oates said as we
watched the ball becoming smaller and smaller until it disappeared
beyond a stand of palm trees behind the fence. ``That ball didn't
go through the palm trees, it went over them!''
</P>
<P>
   His play-by-play was punctuated by another ``Crack!'' and
another ball flying into the stratosphere.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's got a car in the parking lot,'' Oates rattled. ``I
wouldn't park out there today, I don't care how much insurance I
had. That's ridiculous.''
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez, who has averaged 144 runs batted in over the past
three seasons, was putting on another of his frequent batting
practice power-hitting shows before the Rangers' exhibition game
with the Phillies yesterday, and no matter how often he has seen
them, Oates never tires of watching.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not the best pure hitter I've ever seen, or the best
power hitter I've ever seen,'' Oates said, ``but I've never seen
anyone better at driving in runs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've played, managed or coached with five different 500-plus
home run hitters _ Hank Aaron, Eddie Mathews, Frank Robinson, Mike
Schmidt and Reggie Jackson _ but none of them was better than Juan
with men on base.''
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, those five all have a common address _ the
National Baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, N.Y. Gonzalez will
be there one day, too, which is why the Rangers must do the smart
thing and sign him to another long-term contract.
</P>
<P>
   Now.
</P>
<P>
   The sooner the better.
</P>
<P>
   They were ahead of their time when they signed him to a
seven-year, $45.45 million contract (including the two options)
after the '93 season. Now they must be just as clever this time,
before Gonzalez becomes a free agent after the 2000 season.
</P>
<P>
   No rush, you say? I beg to differ. The closer Gonzalez gets to
free agency, the more his agents and the players' union will push
him in that direction.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only way to find out how much you're worth on the market
is go try it,'' Oates said. ``Some of our players have gone that
route and regretted it later.''
</P>
<P>
   If this is just about money, if becoming wealthy to the point of
absurdity is all that matters to Gonzalez, then there's probably
not much the Rangers, who at least have opened negotiations, can do
to get this done. Gonzalez and Ken Griffey Jr., who also becomes a
free agent after the 2000 season, can take turns setting new
records for greed and avarice.
</P>
<P>
   But Juan has never been that kind of person.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a business game,'' Gonzalez conceded, ``but Texas has
provided me security and the fans like me there. It's a great place
to play. Sometimes you maybe can make more money some other place,
but you don't feel as comfortable playing there.''
</P>
<P>
   How much is enough? That's the question Gonzalez must ponder.
How much does he need to assuage his pride and make him feel
wanted? Those who know him say he will feel insulted if the Rangers
offer him Mo Vaughn money _ $13.33 million a year _ and that he'd
like to see them do something about the two option years (this year
and next) on his contract. He will make about $16 million over the
next two years, and yes, that's well under market value.
</P>
<P>
   Just what is Gonzalez, who hit his 301st career home run before
celebrating his 29th birthday last October, worth?
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever he can get,'' second baseman Mark McLemore said.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers, who are uncomfortable with the idea of
renegotiating Gonzalez's contract, must hope that Gonzalez will
maintain control of his contract situation and not leave it
strictly with agent Jim Bronner. Bronner preferred to take
Colorado's Larry Walker to free agency, but Walker pushed to
re-sign with the Rockies and got $75 million for six years.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers must get Gonzalez's attention and keep him
interested. They can do that by offering him a hefty signing bonus,
say something in the $10 million range, which allows them to deal
with the next two years without actually re-negotiating. Then they
extend him with a five-year deal for $15 million a year. That would
give Gonzalez a seven-year total of $91 million.
</P>
<P>
   Only the Pentagon and Kevin Brown could get insulted at that
kind of money.
</P>
<P>
   ``If \Rthe Rangers\S continue to be smart,'' McLemore said,
``they'll do it now, before he throws another MVP award on 'em.
He's got that look in his eye like, `Let's go, let's get this
season started.'''
</P>
<P>
   For the Rangers, it's the classic, pay-him-now or
pay-him-a-lot-more-later dilemma.
</P>
<P>
   It's probably a little more complicated than that, of course,
but how smart do you have to be to figure that one out?
</P>

WOOD NEEDED MORE MUSCLE, HOUSE SAYS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By T.R. SULLIVAN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Chicago Cubs pitcher Kerry Wood was too strong and talented for
his own body, a problem all-star reliever Robb Nen had when he was
with the Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   That's the opinion of former Rangers pitching coach Dr. Tom
House, now a consultant with the San Diego Padres and a nationally
known expert on pitching injuries and rehabilitation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The generated arm strength, and the muscle mass and the muscle
stamina didn't match up,'' House said. ``That's why he broke. He
was not strong enough or mature enough or hard-working enough for
what his gene pool produced.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cubs announced Tuesday that Wood, a former Grand Prairie
High School star, has a torn ligament in his right elbow and will
require surgery. He is expected to miss the entire season.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only way those kids who throw hard enough can support it
is if they have to find enough strength to make it all hold
together,'' House said. ``The support systems _ primary muscles,
secondary muscles and connective tissue _ weren't functionally
strong enough with Kerry to balance the 100 mile per hour arm
speed.''
</P>
<P>
   House said the Rangers went through that with Nen and eventually
decided to move him to the bullpen. Nen also went on a massive
weightlifting program and, after the Rangers traded him, became a
front-line closer with the Florida Marlins and the San Francisco
Giants.
</P>
<P>
   ``The difference is Robb Nen worked his tail off,'' House said.
``If Kerry wants to be a starter, he's got to go hard; he's got to
become Roger Clemens or Nolan Ryan in the weight room to give
himself the strength base for what he creates.''
</P>
<P>
   Wood told a news conference in Arizona on Wednesday, ``It's safe
to say it was inevitable. From the time my velocity picked up and I
started to throw harder, I felt it could happen on any given day.''
</P>
<P>
   House said he did not believe Wood's mechanics or his workload
contributed to the injuries, and others agreed with him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every year he's pitched since high school, he's missed time
because of his elbow,'' said Phil Regan, the Cubs' pitching coach
last year and now with the Cleveland Indians. ``All through his
career he has missed time because of his elbow. The other thing is,
last year was the first time he has pitched more than 150
innings.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cubs kept Wood on a strict 110-pitch count through his
minor-league development, and his 20-strikeout performance against
the Houston Astros last May is the only complete game of his
professional career. Only nine of his 28 starts last year went
longer than seven innings.
</P>
<P>
   Wood complained of a tired arm last August. He threw more than
120 pitches just once in his last nine starts before being shut
down in September. He made one start against the Atlanta Braves in
the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Cardinals manager Tony La Russa was among those who praised Cubs
manager Jim Riggleman for the way he used Wood last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wasn't going to put his own situation above the kid's
future, which would have been very easy for anyone to do,'' La
Russa told reporters in Florida. ``There are right ways to do
things and that's the way Jim Riggleman does them. He would rather
sacrifice his own career rather than do the wrong thing and hurt
the kid. He has too much integrity for that.''
</P>
<P>
   Said House, ``The Cubs did everything they were supposed to do.
His mechanics were 94 percent correct, and they were very concerned
about his pitch totals. The piece of the puzzle they missed was
functional strength.'' nn

COWBOYS RAISE TICKET PRICES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CLARENCE E. HILL JR. 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ It is unknown whether speedy receiver Raghib
Ismail will be a Cowboys player in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   What is clear is that fans will pay more to watch the Cowboys at
Texas Stadium next season, with or without Ismail.
</P>
<P>
   Ticket prices have increased an average of 10.1 percent from
last year in the price list released yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   Cowboys owner Jerry Jones was unavailable to comment.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, the average ticket price for a seat at Texas Stadium
was $45.01. The new average price for all seats, including luxury
suites, is $49.54. For nonluxury suite seats, which are roughly 89
percent of the stadium's capacity, the average price will increase
to $47.91 from $43.58 last season.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1980, the club has changed ticket prices almost every two
years with an average price increase of 17.1 percent. Since Jones
bought the team in 1989, this is the sixth price change, at an
average increase of 11.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the traditional matchups against NFC East foes,
the 1999 home schedule features matchups against the NFC champion
Atlanta Falcons, the New York Jets, the Green Bay Packers and the
Miami Dolphins.
COWBOYS RE-SIGN TWO
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys re-signed punter Toby Gowin and defensive tackle
Nathan Davis to one-year contracts, bringing to six the number of
the Cowboys' exclusive-rights free agents with new deals.
</P>
<P>
   The team previously reached deals with linebackers Nate Hemsley,
Brandon Tolbert and Robert Thomas and quarterback Mike Quinn. Still
unsigned are kicker Richie Cunningham, safety Singor Mobley and
center Mike Kiselak. nn

DUKE ROLLS TO EAST REGIONAL FINAL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By WENDELL BARNHOUSE 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ There's a reason that one of Mike
Krzyzewski's prized Labradors is named ``Defense.'' Forget the 93
points a game and the 26-point winning margins. The name of the
Blue Devils' game is defense.
</P>
<P>
   Duke's ability to put the clamps on an opponent came in handy
Friday night. The top-seeded Blue Devils (35-1) won their 30th
consecutive game, ``struggling' to a 78-61 victory over 12th-seeded
Southwest Missouri State (22-11) in the East Regional semifinals.
</P>
<P>
   Somewhere between Charlotte and here, the Blue Devils lost their
take-no-prisoners intensity that produced two 41-point victories.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been playing unusually great basketball,'' Duke coach
Mike Krzyzewski said. ``In the first half, we wouldn't get a loose
ball that would have been two points for us and they'd pick it up
and score.''
</P>
<P>
   Halfway through the first half, Krzyzewski yelled ``You're
playing soft.'' The Blue Devils, for once, were passive. Southwest
Missouri State beat them to loose balls and rebounds. Twice the
Bears scored baskets after winning ``up-for-grab'' situations.
</P>
<P>
   But for all their effort and good fortune, the Bears still found
themselves looking up at a 39-30 halftime deficit. And they had to
believe that a Blue Devil blast was forthcoming.
</P>
<P>
   And it did come. Duke closed down the Bears' offense,
particularly over the last 15 minutes. As the Blue Devils
inexorably pulled away, their defense made the difference. The
Bears shot just 37 percent from the field.
</P>
<P>
   The Blue Devils swarmed Southwest Missouri State center Danny
Moore with double and triple teams, limiting him to 15 hard-earned
points on 5-of-15 shooting.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got beat by a better team,'' said Southwest Missouri State
coach Steve Alford, noting Duke's 50 percent shooting. ``We knew we
had to shoot a pretty high percentage and we needed them to miss
some shots.''
</P>
<P>
   Duke's offensive spark came from senior guard Trajan Langdon,
who had 24 and a career-high eight rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Give credit to SMS, they matched our intensity,'' said
Langdon, who made 4-of-6 3-point shots. ``They controlled the
tempo. But we didn't come ready to play like we've done all year.''

WEST: ROLLING TO SUCCESS
<TEXT>
<P>
   Khalid El-Amin has a shape more fitting for a right guard on the
Connecticut football team than a point guard on the basketball
team. At 5-foot-10, 220 pounds, El-Amin is about as wide as he is
tall.
</P>
<P>
   Before and during games, opposing fans make sure to remind
El-Amin of his portly physique. They call him, ``Fat Boy,'' and
``Pillsbury Doughboy.'' Sometimes the heckling is so intense that
El-Amin just laughs at himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were in Virginia last year,'' El-Amin said, ``during
pregame warmups, and when I was going through the layup drills and
a guy shows me a Domino's Pizza box. He asks me if I'm hungry. I
said no. He said that he'd just keep the box and offer me some at
halftime.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stuff that people say about me does not bother me,'' said
El-Amin, who had 21 points, and five assists in the Huskies' 78-68
victory against Iowa in the West regional semifinals Thursday. ``It
actually motivates me, inspires me, and makes me want to do
better.''
</P>
<P>
   El-Amin's ample posterior might be the butt of many jokes, but
he usually gets the last laugh. He is the one who lightens up the
mood by making jokes in the locker room. He can impersonate most of
his teammates, and each of the coaches. He likes being the center
of attention, The media spectacle that is March Madness is made for
him.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the best time of year for me personally,'' El-Amin
said. ``I like the media attention and I want to play well when it
is like that. Careers are made in the NCAA Tournament. This is
where the big-time players make their name.'' _ Kevin Lyons
MIDWEST: EXPLAINING UPSETS
</P>
<P>
   Although Oklahoma came in still bristling at being a No. 13
seed, the Sooners are perfectly in step with the prevailing trend
of the NCAA Tournament.
</P>
<P>
   It has been the day of the underdog, and Sooners coach Kelvin
Sampson thinks he knows why.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think you can trace a lot of it to the drop in scholarships
from 15 to 13.'' he said. ``The big teams just aren't as dominant
as they once were.
</P>
<P>
   ``You used to see teams that not only had five truly outstanding
players out on the floor, they had five more sitting on the bench
waiting their turn.
</P>
<P>
   ``That depth has thinned out, and another factor is the number
of kids turning pro after their junior year. A lot of kids will go
where they can get that chance; they're not interested in sitting
on the bench.''
</P>
<P>
   It has been suggested to Sampson that he has developed a unique
method of giving the Sooners an edge _ filling spots on the squad
with talented players from Mexico such as Eduardo Najera and Victor
Avila.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, I hope we've cornered the market for the moment,''
Sampson said. ``But there's a problem you run into: how many of
those guys are both great players and bilingual? Najera had to
learn English before coming here, and that was harder than anything
he's faced on the court. But I would like to see more players
coming in from those countries.'' _ Whit Canning
</P>
<P>
   EAST: SIGN OF THE TIMES
</P>
<P>
   Some people have business cards; Marty Prather does. But he also
has signs. Big, view-blocking signs. One sums up his support of
Southwest Missouri State's basketball team.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fans Go To Games; Fantatics Help Win Them.''
</P>
<P>
   Prather, a Springfield, Mo., native, is familiar to baseball
fans in St. Louis as ``commander-in-chief'' of the MacAttackPack, a
Mark McGwire fan club. Prather holds up pre-printed signs during
Cardinals games in Busch Stadium and he does similar work for the
Bears.
</P>
<P>
   Wearing a maroon hard hat, Prather was on hand in East
Rutherford, N.J. last night for the Bears' loss to top-seeded Duke
in the East Regional semifinals.
</P>
<P>
   One of his signs had an optimistic tone. It had the scores of
the Villanova-Georgetown and North Carolina State-Houston games.
There were blanks next to ``SMS'' and ``Duke.'' Unfortunately for
Prather and other Bears fans, those blanks were filled in with 78
for Duke and 61 for Southwest Missouri State.
</P>
<P>
   It is an expensive hobby. Prather's signs cost $80 (printing on
both sides). For Southwest Missouri State's East Regional game
Friday, Prather had about 20 signs or $1,600 worth of signage.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got a friend who makes them for me,'' Prather said. ``I'm
putting his son through college.'' _ Wendell Barnhouse
SOUTH: A MASCOT'S STORY
</P>
<P>
   One should not jump to conclusions based solely on appearance,
Ohio State mascot Brutus the Buckeye says.
</P>
<P>
   So don't think Brutus is prejudiced toward football just because
he wears shoulder pads, what appears to be football pants and a
quarterback's towel hanging down from his waist.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is what happens when you don't hit the weight room,''
Brutus said, explaining the shoulder-pad look.
</P>
<P>
   Brutus' alter-ego is actually business-marketing major Jamie
Cleverly, a native of Columbus, Ohio, and a longtime Ohio State fan
who has been inside Brutus' head for three years now. And no,
neither Brutus nor Jamie prefer the gridiron over the court.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love basketball,'' Cleverly said. ``Especially this season
with the big turnaround \Rfrom 8-22\S. This has been a great
season. But I like football, too. And hockey.''
</P>
<P>
   Jamie and Brutus are both diplomats as well. _ Mike Jones

BURN BANKS ON OLD FACES, NEW GOAL-ORIENTED ATTITUDE
</HEADLINE>
 BURN-TEX (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BLANE BACHELOR 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ The Major League Soccer season begins Saturday, but
already the Dallas Burn is concerned about finishing.
</P>
<P>
   Finishing, of course, in soccer parlance means scoring goals.
And last season, the Burn mustered a league-low 1.3 goals per game
on the way to losing nine games by one-goal margins, including the
season-ending 3-2 defeat against
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles in the first round of the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Dave Dir ``is really stressing to us that he wants goals
scored this year,'' midfielder Jason Kreis said. ``He wants to
score goals right away. We've played more direct (in the
preseason). The midfielders are getting the ball to the forwards
much quicker. We're going to go at teams more than we have in the
past.''
</P>
<P>
   The Burn lost two key players from last season's squad that
finished 15-17. Swiss international star Alain Sutter was hampered
by a hip injury most of last year and hasn't returned to MLS.
Often-injured Gerrell Elliott is also gone.
</P>
<P>
   However, the familiar faces that have formed the backbone of the
team the past three seasons have returned. Leonel Alvarez, Dante
Washington, Chad Deering, Oscar Pareja, Mark Dodd, Kreis and Jorge
Rodriguez _ all established names within MLS and international
soccer _ should continue as the core of the squad.
</P>
<P>
   Dir's vision is for those mainstays to renew on-the-field
chemistry for a more efficient offense this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've gotten younger, but not so young we don't have a good
base group here that could compete right away, without having to
start with scratch,'' Dir said. ``We could have gutted it and taken
away the core of a team that took us to the finals of the West (in
1997) and the Open Cup title (in 1997). We don't want to destroy
that either.''
</P>
<P>
   What destroyed the team last year _ and what Dir says is often
overlooked when considering the team's subpar finish _ was a rash
of injuries. Ten starters combined to miss a total of 82 games
because of injuries, not counting additional time that didn't add
up to full games.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my opinion I think (last year) was a success,'' Kreis said.
``We played through extremely large adversity and made through it
by getting to the playoffs. I don't think too many other MLS teams
could have done that. It shows a lot of depth and character from
guys that we have.''
</P>
<P>
   In hopes of boosting offensive firepower, the team is still in
the hunt for a proven forward to play alongside Washington up
front. The Burn has another foreign-player slot to fill, and
forward is the likely spot for such an acquisition.
</P>
<P>
   The other question mark _ acquiring a sweeper _ has been
answered, but not with a new face. After playing midfield last
year, Richard Farrer has secured the starting spot with impressive
play during the preseason. With the help of Rodriguez in the back
line, the Burn's defense could emerge as one of this season's
strengths.
</P>
<P>
   Dir was pleased with how all those facets clicked during the
preseason. The Burn finished its usual tour through Mexico and its
first overseas trip _ to southern France _ with a 9-3-1 record
against upper- and middle-division teams.
</P>
<P>
   How the squad will fare in the MLS season is another question,
though. Players and coaches aren't promising a trip to the MLS Cup,
but they're predicting different _ and better _ results from
essentially the same team.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's where it comes into play about getting the most of
players,'' goalkeeper Mark Dodd said. ``I said it last year and
I'll say it again. If every player is able to up their level of
performance by 10 or 20 percent, I think collectively as a team
(we're) going to have far superior outcome. Obviously, with team
chemistry and getting things together, you can get different things
with the same core.'' nn

GAGA OVER GONZAGA

<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ The alumni include late actor and crooner Bing Crosby,
former Speaker of the House Thomas Foley, and NBA basketball star
John Stockton.
</P>
<P>
   But until this month, much of the nation never knew the three
had any connections. Yet that is the beauty of sports. A no-name
team comes into the NCAA basketball tournament, unexpectedly wins a
few games, and everyone wants to know: ``Where did these guys come
from?''
</P>
<P>
   Gonzaga University.
</P>
<P>
   Pronounced Gone-Zag-Uh, this Jesuit Catholic school with an
enrollment of about 4,500 is nestled in Spokane, Wash.
Hewlett-Packard is one of the city's major employers. People think
more about computers than college basketball in this town of
450,000 that was ranked as the eighth-best place to raise a family
in the April 1997 issue of ``Reader's Digest''.
</P>
<P>
   Gone-Zag-uh.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, for the first time, there is something else to boast
about this time of year. Like the folks in, say, Storrs, Conn., or
Durham, N.C., the people in Spokane are watching their college
basketball team have quite a season.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a lineup that features just two players taller than
6-foot-8, the Gonzaga Bulldogs won the West Coast Conference
tournament to earn a No. 10 seed in the NCAA tournament. Led by
junior guard Richie Frahm, the Bulldogs have shot 50.8 percent from
the three-point line to defeat seventh-seed Minnesota, second-seed
Stanford and sixth-seed Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Today, as the first No. 10 seed to make it to a regional
championship game in eight years, Gonzaga will wear the glass
slipper again in hopes that the clock doesn't strike midnight. The
opponent: Top-seeded Connecticut in the West Regional championship
game at America West Arena.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we had to play UConn 10 times, we'd be in trouble,''
second-year coach Dan Monson said. ``But we don't have to play them
10 times. We just have to play them once, for 40 minutes. And
that's the beauty of the tournament. Anything can happen at any
time in one game.''
</P>
<P>
   Gone-Zag-uh.
</P>
<P>
   How did the stars and the moon align just so for the Bulldogs?
</P>
<P>
   Monson, who was born in Spokane, wanted a career in football.
But a knee injury at Vanderbilt cut short his career and he turned
to coaching, where he first landed a job as a high school boys
basketball coach in Oregon.
</P>
<P>
   Senior guard Quentin Hall said Gonzaga was the only school to
offer him a scholarship, so he left his family and the warm beaches
of the Bahamas to play in the chilly Northwest.
</P>
<P>
   Frahm's list of recruiters thinned after he suffered a broken
ankle in his junior year of high school. He picked Gonzaga over
Baylor, although UCLA and Arizona State showed interest after he
signed early.
</P>
<P>
   A few friends talked Gonzaga up to senior center Jeremy Eaton,
who was at first wary of the school because, ``I didn't always want
to have my nose in a book.''
</P>
<P>
   Sophomore forward Casey Calvary, whose last-second tip-in
Thursday vaulted the Bulldogs over Florida, wanted to hang out with
some of his friends who were already there. So did junior guard
Matt Santangelo.
</P>
<P>
   The players keep a close relationship. Jokes, and light-hearted
kidding keep everybody light. When asked how the team would come
off on say, ``The Tonight Show with Jay Leno'', Santangelo said,
``We'd do better on \RJerry\S Springer than the late night talk
shows the way this team interacts with each other.''
</P>
<P>
   Gone-Zag-Uh.
</P>
<P>
   Only the 10 Bulldogs players, Monson, and his three assistants
knew they could play this well. They had gone 1-4 against ranked
teams during the regular season (including a 90-87 loss at TCU).
``We played well,'' Monson said. They are not afraid. Cinderella?
In the eyes of Monson, that tag doesn't fit this team.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cinderella is one of those tags that happens in the first or
second round _ not at this level,'' Monson said. ``These kids
believe that they belong. If our jerseys didn't say, `Gonzaga,' on
the back, but a state name instead, we wouldn't be a Cinderella
team. We would just be a good team.''

JUST WHAT DUKE NEEDS: HEALTHY LANGDON IS BACK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By WENDELL BARNHOUSE 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ Just in time for its national
championship hunt, Duke has regained its heart and soul.
</P>
<P>
   Senior guard Trajan Langdon, who missed three games with a
sprained foot, returned to the lineup in the Blue Devils'
second-round victory over Tulsa. Last night in the East Regional
semifinal victory over Southwest Missouri State, Langdon scored a
team-high 24 points.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been able to practice all week and my foot feels really
good,'' said Langdon, Duke's second-leading scorer. ``I just wanted
to stay aggressive.''
</P>
<P>
   Duke needed that aggression. The Bears stayed within striking
distance until midway through the second half.
</P>
<P>
   ``Langdon is a great scorer and shooter, he was the
difference,'' Southwest Missouri State coach Steve Alford said.
FINDING FLAWS
</P>
<P>
   Duke has won its past 12 games by the average margin of 29
points. The closest game over that span was an 83-68 victory over
North Carolina State in the semifinals of the Atlantic Coast
Conference tournament.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our coaching staff showed us that Duke does have some
faults,'' Southwest Missouri State point guard William Fontelroy
said. ``There wasn't a whole bunch. We tried to drive and kick to
our shooters, go inside to \Rcenter Danny Moore\S. We saw that on
the press, if we could break it, we'd get easy shots. And if we
pushed the ball in transition, they couldn't be able set up their
defense.''
BRIEFLY
</P>
<P>
   Duke is 14-1 in East Rutherford. The Blue Devils' only loss came
to Arizona, 77-75, on Feb. 26, 1989. In NCAA Tournament East
Regional games, Duke is 9-0 here.
</P>
<P>
   Duke coach Mike Krzyzewski needs one more victory to tie former
UCLA coach John Wooden on the NCAA Tournament coaching victory
list. Krzyzewski has 46. Former North Carolina coach Dean Smith is
No. 1 on the list with 65.
</P>
<P>
   Superior depth? Against Southwest Missouri State, Duke's bench
provided 14 points and 10 rebounds. The Bears' reserves had 30
points and 13 rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   Temple, which finished third in the 1956 and 1958 Final Fours,
has lost three regional finals in the past 11 years. In 1988, the
top-seeded Owls lost to second-seeded Duke. In 1991, they lost to
top-seeded North Carolina. In 1993, they lost to top-seeded
Michigan.

GONZAGA'S RUN REMINISCENT OF PROVIDENCE TEAM OF '87
</HEADLINE>
 NOTES-TEX (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN LYONS 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The way Gonzaga is making its 3-point shots reminds Connecticut
coach Jim Calhoun of the way the 1987 Providence team, coached by
Rick Pitino, made the Final Four.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzaga has made 50.8 percent of its 3-pointers, including 12 of
22 in the one-point victory over Florida on Thursday, and just 43.8
percent of its 2-point attempts.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last time we faced a team like (Gonzaga) it was Billy
Donovan's team,'' Calhoun said of Donovan, the Florida coach who
was a player on that team. ``At that time, (current Connecticut
guard) Khalid El-Amin was 7. Gonzaga right now has great
confidence. It isn't a case of if the shot will go in, it's when.
We don't want to overextend ourselves and allow penetration from
their guards, or post-ups by their big men.'' CLIMATE DIDN'T SUIT
HIS CLOTHES
</P>
<P>
   Gonzaga guard Quentin Hall is out of his element. He grew up on
the warm beaches of the Bahamas. Yet the only school to offer him a
scholarship was Gonzaga, which is located in chilly Spokane, Wash.
</P>
<P>
   Hall's biggest adjustment?
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to buy more clothes,'' he said. ``I only had one jacket
and it was for rain.'' FINALLY FOUR?
</P>
<P>
   Calhoun is 331-122 in 13 seasons at Connecticut, and 581-259 in
27 years overall as a college coach. But he has never been to a
Final Four. He has taken Connecticut to the Elite Eight three times
this decade, only to lose each time.
</P>
<P>
   All week, Calhoun has had to answer questions about his failures
to reach the Final Four. He said if he loses Saturday, that he
should not be considered a failure.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody has made so much of us getting to the Final Four,''
Calhoun said. ``I know I will not change. I won't be a better coach
if we get there. I know I won't be a worse coach if we don't. When
your career is 830, 840 games and you get judged on two or three,
it's not entirely (fair). In the next 10 years, if we average 26
wins a year and we don't get to the Final Four, I'll be a happy
coach. I won't be a satisfied coach, but I will be a happy coach.''
CASEY'S DAY
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday night, his tip-in with 4.4 seconds remaining gave
the Bulldogs a one-point victory over Florida. He partied with his
teammates, coaches and friends. But he couldn't sleep late.
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to the world of being a hero, Casey Calvary.
</P>
<P>
   ``At 6:30 a.m., radio stations were calling my room asking me
about the shot,'' the Gonzaga forward said. ``I'd be on the air,
just sleeping. Some of the stations called and asked, `Why did I go
over that guy's back. (Florida's Brent Wright).' I was just
sleepy.'' nn

TOP-SEEDED SPARTANS ROLL
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS _ The prevailing line about Oklahoma and Michigan
State was that it figured to be a great football game.
</P>
<P>
   Living up to its advance billing, it produced a 54-46 Michigan
State victory and a bloody collision that both sides identified as
the key moment of the battle.
</P>
<P>
   It occurred with 9 minutes, 34 seconds remaining and left two
players _ Michigan State's Mateen Cleaves and Oklahoma's Eduardo
Najera out cold on the floor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to say that if we had had Ed we would have won,
because Michigan State won this game,'' OU coach Kelvin Sampson
said. ``But it hurt us.''
</P>
<P>
   Spartans coach Tom Izzo was somewhat more emphatic.
</P>
<P>
   ``That helped us a lot, truth be known,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after the moment of impact, the top-seeded Spartans
(32-4) went on a brief run that doubled a five-point lead, and
Oklahoma (22-11) never caught up.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a very physical game,'' Izzo said. ``And it kind of
typifies our season, I guess. It's hard to define exactly why we
won, but we did.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the larger reasons was the disappearance of Oklahoma's
vaunted 3-point game in the face of a withering Michigan State
perimeter defense. The Sooners, a team that averages 22 3-point
shots per game, had their worst outing of the season _ 4-of-15 _
from beyond the arc.
</P>
<P>
   ``We put a lot of emphasis on stopping that part of their game,
and I guess we did a pretty good job,'' said Izzo, whose team won
its 21st consecutive game and 28th of the past 29.
</P>
<P>
   As for the collision, both players eventually returned to the
game _ but Cleaves, whose head had collided with Najera's chin on a
pick, was better off.
</P>
<P>
   Najera, OU's leading scorer, suffered a concussion and lacerated
chin and was unable to play effectively after his return.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're kind of used to this sort of thing, because we see it a
lot in the Big 10,'' said the Spartans' Antonio Smith. ``We'll take
a win any old way, on a fast break or beating the crap out of each
other.''
</P>
<P>
   When it was over, Cleaves said he felt pretty good.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just never saw him,'' he said. ``I've got a bump on my head.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a pretty ugly game, but to tell you the truth, it's
been a pretty ugly tournament. We're just glad we're still in it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sooners cut the Spartans lead to 47-43 on Ryan Humphrey's
free throw with 1:41 left, but never got closer. Michigan State
made five free throws to stretch it back to 52-43 with 21 seconds
left, and Sampson sent Najera off to be X-rayed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a fistfight, and we lost,'' Sampson said. ``It was
tough going out there and seeing my best player lying in a pool of
blood with his chin laid open. But I was proud of the way we
played. We did the things we wanted _ stopping their transition and
keeping them off the boards, but they stopped us on the
perimeter.''  &LR; tagtop:Whit Canning, (817) 390-7760

TEMPLE WALLOPS PURDUE WITH TECHNICAL KNOCKOUT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By WENDELL BARNHOUSE 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ Combine 52 percent shooting with
Temple's sticky matchup zone defense and the Owls become a
dangerous team. Purdue discovered that fact.
</P>
<P>
   Going against the bricklaying trend of this NCAA Tournament,
Temple shot 52.7 percent to swamp 10th-seeded Purdue, 77-55, in
Friday night's East Regional semifinal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very surprised,'' Temple coach John Chaney said. ``Maybe
I've seen them shoot this well one other time. Maybe one surprise
begets another.''
</P>
<P>
   The sixth-seeded Owls (24-10) will play top-seeded Duke, a 78-61
winner over Southwest Missouri State, in Sunday's regional final.
</P>
<P>
   Purdue was its own worse enemy. The Boilermakers (21-13) held an
11-7 lead when they imploded. Two technical fouls _ one on Jaraan
Cornell, the other on the Purdue bench _ helped the Owls score 10
consecutive points without the Boilermakers touching the ball.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Quincy Wadley) pushed me and I kind of nudged him back and I
guess the official felt he needed to make a statement,'' Cornell
said.
</P>
<P>
   Temple completed a three-point play, then made both technical
free throws, then two more technical free throws, a free throw on a
foul and finally a basket _ all without Purdue getting a
possession.
</P>
<P>
   ``That gave us the momentum, got us in the flow of the game,''
said Temple's Mark Karcher, who finished with 21 points and made
5-of-12 3-pointers.
</P>
<P>
   Two minutes later, after Purdue closed to within 24-18, Temple
broke the Boilermakers' spirit with a 13-0 run. Karcher hit a pair
of 3-pointers. After the second _ set up by two jab steps that
froze Purdue's Brian Cardinal _ Karcher headed to the defensive end
shaking his head as if to say, ``He can't check me.''
</P>
<P>
   In the first half, the Boilermakers shot 55 percent from the
field and 80 percent from 3-point range _ and trailed, 47-32.
Temple scored an astounding 25 points from 11 Purdue turnovers and
turned 10 offensive rebounds into 16 points.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just couldn't contain them,'' Purdue coach Gene Keady said.
``Sanchez is the best point guard we've played and we didn't have
an answer for Karcher.''
</P>
<P>
   The 22-point defeat was Purdue's worst in 41 NCAA Tournament
games.
</P>
<P>
   Temple closed it out with another run. After an Alan Eldridge
3-pointer made it 47-35 with 18:12 remaining, the Owls went on a
14-1 run. Karcher and Sanchez hit 3-pointers and Quincy Wadley
converted a three-point play.
</P>
<P>
   With 13 minutes remaining, Temple's fans began the prerequisite
``We Want Duke'' chant. Request granted.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those fans don't know what they're talking about,'' Chaney
said. ``I don't want to see 'em, but I gotta see 'em. Who wants to
see Duke?'' nn

GONZAGA SWAGGER ONLY GROWING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By LAURA VECSEY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ A little less than 24 hours after their thrilling
Sweet 16 victory on a tip-in, who would have blamed the Gonzaga
Bulldogs if reality had set in and, surprise, no one especially
liked what they saw?
</P>
<P>
   Up now, the Connecticut Huskies, the No. 1 seed in the West with
a Duke-like 31-2 record.
</P>
<P>
   Up now, a bruiser of a point guard named Khalid El-Amin, a
devastating forward named Richard Hamilton and a UConn portfolio so
thick with NCAA tournament wins it could knock you out cold.
</P>
<P>
   The Huskies, ever since August, have been focused on winning a
national championship. Their mission continues, and they wear the
steely look of executives with unfinished business.
</P>
<P>
   The Zags, ever since last March, when they were not included in
the 64-team field, have been eagerly awaiting the opportunity to
embarrass the selection committee for not giving them a chance.
</P>
<P>
   The Zags, playing like a creme de la creme Pac-10 team, have
certainly accomplished their primary goal. They find themselves one
victory away from a trip to next week's Final Four.
</P>
<P>
   So under that scenario, who would have blamed the Zags if they
just plain got up Friday and freaked out? Who would have blamed
them if they realized they finally hit their heads on college
basketball's glass ceiling?
</P>
<P>
   It didn't happen. And it doesn't look like it's going to happen
_ not the way the Zags are taking their 15 minutes of fame and
sharing it with a national audience.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been crazy, taking chartered flights, getting police
escorts like we did to the game (Thursday),'' point guard Matt
Santangelo said.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we saw the flashing lights, we thought we were getting
pulled over for something. We were like, `What did we do?' But
we've been able to stay loose through it all. We've been loose all
year _ a lot of times at each other's expense,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In front of the national sporting media, Santangelo said that if
the Zags could pick one TV show to appear on, should they do the
improbable and win a national championship, they wouldn't take Jay
Leno or David Letterman.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we'd do better on the `Jerry Springer Show,' the way
we fight and claw with each other,'' Santangelo said.
</P>
<P>
   The deeper they get in this NCAA tournament, the looser and
goosier and more confident they become. This could mean one of two
things:
</P>
<P>
   1. The Zags are willing to go down laughing; or,
</P>
<P>
   2. They are hellbent on having the last laugh.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, at 6:30 a.m. Friday, Casey Calvary's phone started
ringing. Radio stations from Washington to New England were dialing
up the hot new star of the NCAA tournament, the blond bruiser whose
two-handed tip gave Gonzaga the 73-72 win over Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Now, under normal circumstances, the Gonzaga forward likes his
beauty rest. Noon is about the time Calvary usually rouses his
6-foot-8 frame from bed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe even 1 p.m.,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But these crazy days of March are anything but normal
circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, I figure instead of being mad because people are
calling me, and I'm trying to talk even though I'm asleep and have
no idea what I'm saying, I might as well enjoy this,'' Calvary
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I mean, two years from now, I'm going to be some bum on the
street corner in Spokane, and no one is going to remember any of
this.''
</P>
<P>
   While this flirtation with celebrity is grand, the Zags are
flying higher on the intense level of basketball they have been
playing all season and especially the last four games, including
their resounding West Coast Conference championship victory that
kicked off this barn-burning roll.
</P>
<P>
   The Zags will not for one second agree with analysts who said
unlike their tournament wins over Minnesota, Stanford and Florida,
the Zags' day of reckoning is now truly upon them, since UConn is
in another class.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like Dick Vitale said about us after we beat Minnesota: `Now
they get Stanford and the dream is over,''' said Calvary, who
politely disagreed with that assessment.
</P>
<P>
   ``We aren't thinking (that since) we're a small school, it's
time for us to go get stomped by a bigger school.''
</P>
<P>
   The Zags still believe this is their best chance to prove their
one, emphatic point. Never mind the soothsayers, who give them no
chance against the Huskies _ who, if you recall, almost fell to the
Washington Huskies last March in the Sweet 16, save for that
Hamilton buzzer-beater.
</P>
<P>
   The Zags might believe they can do what their cross-state rivals
from the Pac-10 could not.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've watched UConn and other teams on ESPN all year long, and
of course you want a chance to go out and play against them to
prove you're good, too,'' Jeremy Eaton said. ``Now it's time to put
up or shut up.''
</P>
<P>
   Loose and tough, the Zags are ready to rumble.

BUHNER STEALS THE THUNDER ON YOUNT DAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN RALEY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MARYVALE, Ariz. _ On Robin Yount Day at Maryvale Baseball Park,
the Milwaukee Brewers saluted their newly elected Hall of Famer
with a poster giveaway and encouraged fans to applaud him.
</P>
<P>
   Yount, however, was a no-show. A local resident, he begged off,
citing a prior commitment.
</P>
<P>
   Just as well. Five batters into the Brewers' game against the
Mariners Friday, this clearly was the Jay Buhner Hour. Two hours,
actually.
</P>
<P>
   Playing 6{ innings, the Mariners' surgically repaired right
fielder socked a three-run home run, drove in a fourth run with a
sacrifice fly and doubled to carry his club to an 11-7 victory. All
of this comes just seven months after having elbow surgery and 11
months after a knee operation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel fine. Everything's great,'' Buhner said as he walked to
the Mariners' charter bus. ``I've got things to do still. I'm not
out of the dark yet. It's OK as long as I take it slow.''
</P>
<P>
   Slow?
</P>
<P>
   His first time up, Buhner stepped into an 0-1 pitch from
left-hander Bill Pulsipher and sent it over the left-field fence.
In the fifth, he launched a sacrifice fly deep to right off Cal
Eldred. In the seventh, Buhner lined a double into the left-field
corner off Eric Plunk.
</P>
<P>
   All hard hits, all coming off veteran pitching.
</P>
<P>
   ``It feels nice to be able to contribute at the plate,'' said
Buhner, who is 8-for-23 (.348) with three homers and 10 RBIs this
spring. ``I know I'm going to contribute defensively once the
season starts.''
</P>
<P>
   He wasn't exactly a liability in right Friday. Buhner didn't
have to test his arm, but he appeared as nimble as ever running
down a couple fly balls.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jay really looked good out there with the bat and the glove,''
manager Lou Piniella said. ``He's coming along great. He's running
better than ever. I might even let him steal.''
</P>
<P>
   MOUND UPDATE: While Buhner forged ahead, rotation candidate John
Halama might have killed his chances to start the season in
Seattle. The 27-year-old left-hander lasted just three innings
against the Brewers, serving up five runs (two earned) and four
walks.
</P>
<P>
   ``He didn't throw the ball all that well,'' Piniella said. ``His
rhythm was not good, he threw a lot of pitches and he was up in the
count. It wasn't one of his better performances. (Butch) Henry has
the edge on him right now.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners Friday outrighted right-hander Maximo De La Rosa to
Tacoma and optioned left-hander Jordan Zimmerman to Class AA New
Haven, reducing their pitching corps to 18. By Tuesday, Piniella
will have pared the list to 14.
</P>
<P>
   He wouldn't offer a confirmation, but his rotation is shaping up
like this: Jeff Fassero, Jamie Moyer, Ken Cloude, Mark Leiter and
Henry, which leaves out rookie Freddie Garcia and veteran Billy
Swift.
</P>
<P>
   HERE TODAY, GONE ...: Even with Bobby Ayala's surprisingly good
camp, Mariner decision-makers privately say they still prefer to
move the veteran reliever rather than keep him. Way too many scars.
</P>
<P>
   With most of the front-office execs looking on Friday, Ayala
threw two innings and let two runs cross in the seventh, personally
getting charged for one.
</P>
<P>
   RELAY THROWS: Alex Rodriguez and Butch Huskey also slugged long
homers against Milwaukee. Huskey's landed near a walkway in left
field, some 430 feet away. ... Neck news: Edgar Martinez returned
to action after suffering neck spasms, but as a first baseman, not
designated hitter. David Segui missed Friday's game and has been
ruled out of Saturday's contest with the same ailment. ... Against
the Brewers, third baseman John Mabry let his frustration show,
winding up and firing his glove into the dugout as the third inning
ended. He had booted a ball, though he was able to recover and
throw the runner out. In the first, he failed to make a play on a
two-out, bases-loaded grounder, his fielding error leading to three
runs. ... Knitted mitt: Last season's embattled third baseman, Russ
Davis, idle Friday, has not been charged with an error in 11 games
this spring.
</P>
<P>
   NAME THAT ROOK: Veterans have given first-year pitcher Freddie
Garcia the nickname ``Chief'' for his resemblance to the character
in the Jack Nicholson movie ``One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest.''
Both lean to the strong, silent type. Garcia, 22, seems to enjoy
the newfound label and says he has seen the movie.
</P>
<P>
   Garcia, who came to the Mariners in the Randy Johnson trade,
might find himself answering to ``Boz'' as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``From behind he walks like Chris Bosio,'' pitcher Jamie Moyer
said. ``He has that bow-legged walk.''
</P>
<P>
   LAST WORD: A clubhouse visitor this week was Alvin Davis, the
former Mariner first baseman. Now 38, Davis works for Pro Athletes
Outreach, a league-wide ministry. He noted how only a handful of
his Seattle teammates remain active, but says he follows the club
closely.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Mariners are in my blood,'' Davis said. ``I've got blue
blood.''

WIDESPREAD ROOTS MAKE ZAGS APPLE OF WASHINGTON EYES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JIM MOORE  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ In the last two weeks, Gonzaga has ruined Minnesota,
Stanford, Florida and office pools everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   The Bulldogs are overachievers, embraced across the country by
college basketball fans who hope Gonzaga can advance to the Final
Four with a victory over Connecticut Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   But nowhere is there more support than here, in Washington,
where no one much cared about the Zags before the NCAA tournament
began. Now you can feel statewide excitement, the passion building
with each Gonzaga win.
</P>
<P>
   For Washingtonians, there is more than a Cinderella connection
with the Bulldogs. Ten of the players are home-grown, nine
graduating from in-state high schools and another who was a junior
college star in Yakima.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly every part of the state is represented _ from Mark Spink
(Sehome) in Bellingham to Richie Frahm in Battle Ground, from Ryan
Floyd in Sprague to Mike Nilson (Shorecrest) in Seattle. There's a
Tacoma-area twosome in Casey Calvary of Bellarmine Prep and Mike
Leasure of Spanaway Lake.
</P>
<P>
   The starting center, Jeremy Eaton, is from Benton City, a
Richland High and Walla Walla CC graduate.
</P>
<P>
   Even the deep reserves _ freshmen Zach Gourde (Prairie) and Eric
Chilton (Kelso) _ have Washington ties.
</P>
<P>
   The Gonzaga catalyst is point guard Quentin Hall, who arrived in
Washington via North Idaho Community College and the Bahamas, an
unusual hoops odyssey that has taken him to the national stage in
Phoenix this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Most were overlooked and underestimated. But the Bulldogs are
lovable mutts, pedigree or no. Here are some of their stories:
</P>
<P>
   SEND IN (THE) CALVARY
</P>
<P>
   When Gonzaga beat Florida on a tip-in by one of their own, the
Bellarmine Prep coaches erupted.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Bernie Salazar and his assistants, Jenny Phillips and
Randy Gause, watched Thursday's game from Prep's basketball office,
where Casey Calvary first walked in as a ``string-bean'' freshman.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was skinny,'' Salazar said. ``I told him, `If you want to
be an impact player, you're going to have to find the weight room.'
I only had to tell him once.''
</P>
<P>
   Gonzaga's 6-foot-8 sophomore forward was in Friday's headlines;
six years ago, he was in the local YMCA at 5 o'clock every morning,
building muscles and a promising basketball career.
</P>
<P>
   Salazar remembers Calvary as a reserved teenager but highly
competitive. Like all of his Gonzaga teammates, Calvary was a
workaholic, making the most of his ability.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wasn't the most talented, but he set the standard for how
hard we were going to work,'' Salazar said.
</P>
<P>
   Early on, the Huskies were interested in Calvary but had a
greater need for perimeter players. That was all right. Calvary
felt that Gonzaga was a perfect fit anyway, even if others did not.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he picked Gonzaga, a lot of people in the area would say,
`Gonzaga, why Gonzaga? He's not going to a very good place.' Look
who's laughing now,'' Salazar said.
</P>
<P>
   Friday in the gym where Calvary played, a spring sports pep
assembly was held. The mention of Calvary's name elicited cheers.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of the kids know who Casey is,'' Salazar said, ``so they
were all excited.''
</P>
<P>
   As is the coach. ``He's living a dream for us,'' Salazar said.
``That's what he's doing.''
</P>
<P>
   BATTLE GROUND TESTED
</P>
<P>
   Richie Frahm was the player who made five 3-pointers against
Florida the other night. Seven years ago, he was just like Calvary,
scrawny and raw but loaded with upside.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a team with no one who wanted to shoot,'' said Battle
Ground coach Butch Blue. ``Richie was a skinny little freshman kid.
I needed a shooter. I told him that was his job. I didn't have time
to wait for him to develop. I needed him right then.''
</P>
<P>
   Manhood waited as the adolescent produced.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had some games where he would flat-out light it up,'' Blue
said. ``He had the kind of body that knew it was going to be a stud
someday.''
</P>
<P>
   Frahm might have been a nothing-but-net kind of player, but no
one seemed to know anything about him during the recruiting
process.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd have coaches come up to me and say, `What's the story? Why
haven't we seen him or heard of him before?''' Blue said.
</P>
<P>
   The reason? Blue said that Frahm played baseball in the
summertime while most other recruits were showcasing their
basketball skills in all-star games.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some schools shied away because they didn't know his
background,'' Blue said.
</P>
<P>
   Now here he is, one game from the Final Four. ``It's fun to see
one of the hometown boys on national TV, Chevrolet player of the
game, hitting game-winning shots,'' Blue said.
</P>
<P>
   THE CLASS B KID
</P>
<P>
   When you're on I-90 and 38 miles from Spokane, take the Sprague
exit and head north for 24 miles. That's where you'll find
Harrington, Wash., and Ryan Floyd.
</P>
<P>
   Because Sprague High and Harrington High have around 60 students
each in grades 9-12, the two schools combine for sports. Floyd
commuted to Sprague to play basketball. He has energized the entire
area.
</P>
<P>
   If the folks here weren't ga-ga for Gonzaga before, they are
now.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are totally, absolutely going crazy,'' said Dee Pearson,
secretary at Sprague High. ``The whole region is crazy about the
Gonzaga Bulldogs. This doesn't happen to (Class) B schools. We're
the little boys.''
</P>
<P>
   THE CITY SLICKER
</P>
<P>
   Mike Nilson was the same kind of player at Shorecrest High _
unselfish and disciplined. If Gonzaga coach Dan Monson wants him to
come off the bench, it's not a problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is such a team-oriented person,'' said Shorecrest coach
Greg Tacon. ``Mike fit in so well he could have easily scored 20 to
30 points a game. But he never complained.''
</P>
<P>
   Nilson averaged around 13 points his senior season, leading
Shore-crest to its fourth straight state tournament appearance.
</P>
<P>
   If Gonzaga wins Saturday, the camera likely will pan to Nilson
at some point. He might be the one in tears.
</P>
<P>
   A half-hour before Shorecrest's state championship game against
Mount Vernon in 1992, then-coach Marv Morris delivered an
inspirational speech in the locker room. Pumped-up, the players
raced onto the floor. Except for Nilson. He was in the shower room,
breaking down.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a special feeling,'' Tacon said. ``I know it's special
for him right now.''
</P>
<P>
   LEASURE WORLD
</P>
<P>
   Walk into the main entrance at Spanaway Lake High School and
take a look at the door to nurse Jeanette Perry's office. There's a
big picture of Mike Leasure, the old alum himself, slapping fans'
hands after beating Stanford at KeyArena last week.
</P>
<P>
   They are reveling in Leasure's success at Spanaway Lake.
Basketball coach Karl Hoseth wore a Gonzaga T-shirt and embroidered
Gonzaga socks to school Friday. Wrestling coach Paul Greeley and
history teacher Amanda Allen also wore T-shirts.
</P>
<P>
   When he was at Spanaway, Gonzaga's 6-7 senior forward displayed
his quickness and ball-handling ability. He was also Spanaway
Lake's best shooter.
</P>
<P>
   Leasure could have been playing at Nevada-Reno for former Cougar
coach Len Stevens. But when Stevens was fired, Leasure was released
from his letter of intent and opted for Gonzaga.
</P>
<P>
   ``It couldn't have worked out any better for him,'' said Russ
Leslie, who coached Leasure at Spanaway Lake.
</P>
<P>
   ISLAND MAGIC
</P>
<P>
   Quentin Hall provides the quickness in Gonzaga's lineup. He
buzzes from one spot on the floor to another. You never know where
he will end up.
</P>
<P>
   It's like his journey to Gonzaga. As a high schooler, Hall
played in Las Vegas with a touring team from his native Bahamas.
Gonzaga assistant coach Mark Few saw him and was impressed. He
suggested that Hall play at Northern Idaho CC before transferring
to Gonzaga.
</P>
<P>
   Hall went to Northern Idaho for a year. Then a coaching change
resulted in a different coaching philosophy. Hall was not wanted at
Northern Idaho anymore and assumed he was going back to the
Bahamas.
</P>
<P>
   Before he left, Hall went to Gonzaga assistant coach Bill
Greer's wedding in Spokane. Leon Rice was also there. The head
coach at Yakima Valley CC lost his starting point guard to a
four-year school and needed another. There were two matches made in
heaven that day.
</P>
<P>
   During his one season in Yakima, Hall led his team to a 26-4
record while being named Eastern Region MVP. Rice's wife, Robin,
helped Hall with his academics. Hall went to Gonzaga this year, and
the acclimation to the state is complete.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's fearless,'' Rice said. ``He leads them into places where
they shouldn't be. It's surreal. They're in the Final 8 in the
nation. It can't be. It can't happen in this day and age.''

   SAUDI-RECESSION (Jidda, Saudi Arabia) _ Faced with a recession,
soaring unemployment and declining incomes, Saudi Arabia is
undergoing a transformation, and what once seemed inconceivable is
slowly becoming the order of the day. The government, famous for
free health and education programs and lavish military spending,
and for never collecting a nickel's worth of taxes, has announced
deep spending cuts concentrated in defense and security. By Douglas

tried to prove that Dr. Jack Kevorkian, the man who says he has
presided over more than 130 suicides, committed a crime when he
helped seriously ill people die. Four times, they have failed. On
Monday, prosecutors will try again. It is a trial that people on

considered criminal or whether they are the entitlement of the
terminally ill. By Pam Belluck.

<P>
   SPRINGSTEEN (Asbury Park, N.J) _ For a small resort city that
has had very little to smile about for decades, the fleeting
reappearance of Bruce Springsteen and his E Street Band, in

   HONGKONG (Hong Kong) _ Confirming a dismal earlier prognosis,
Hong Kong's government said the economy shrank an estimated 5.7

JUMBO JETLINER LOST POWER, NARROWLY MISSED SAN FRANCISCO HILLSIDE
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By BRUCE RAMSEY  
 AND PAUL SHUKOVSKY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Last June, a Boeing 747-400 lifting off from San
Francisco International Airport with 307 people aboard came within
100 feet of crashing into a hillside thick with houses and
apartments.
</P>
<P>
   The jumbo jet lost power in one engine. And the co-pilot _
apparently with little recent experience at the controls on takeoff
_ nearly flew the plane into what could have been one of the worst
aviation disasters in history.
</P>
<P>
   Sources at the Federal Aviation Administration and United
Airlines Friday confirmed an account published in The Wall Street
Journal. The incident, just now being publicly disclosed, has
spurred the FAA to require United to increase training of pilots on
the 747-400, the industry's longest-range airplane.
</P>
<P>
   ``The 400 is a spectacular airplane,'' says Clay Foushee, vice
president for regulatory affairs at Northwest Airlines. ``But ...
it's the airplane that's never on the ground.'' In flights of more
than 12 hours, it is required to have four certified pilots on
board. A pilot therefore may get few turns performing takeoffs and
landings.
</P>
<P>
   That's what may have been the problem with Flight 863. The
flight departed at 11:30 p.m. on June 27 bound for Sydney,
Australia. As the heavily laden jet climbed into the fog,
retracting its landing gear, one of its four engines conked out,
according to an FAA report. ``They were losing speed and the plane
started to literally shake,'' said an FAA official who asked not to
be identified.
</P>
<P>
   A co-pilot was at the controls, with two other officers sitting
behind him, shouting advice. He cut fuel to the malfunctioning
engine, according to The Wall Street Journal.
</P>
<P>
   Because there were two engines functioning on the left wing and
just one on the right, the plane veered to the right. To
compensate, the pilot turned the control wheel left instead of
using the rudder. Wing ailerons extended, slowing the air speed and
threatening a stall. By the time the error was corrected, the plane
was off course, low and headed for San Bruno Mountain, crowded at
its base with houses and apartments. The 747 cleared the mountain
by just 100 feet.
</P>
<P>
   The FAA official said the pilot was so focused on the engine
problem that he almost neglected to take the steps necessary to
keep the aircraft aloft.
</P>
<P>
   The Journal reported that the pilot at the controls was out of
practice on the 747-400, having made one takeoff and landing in the
previous week and no others for nearly a year.
</P>
<P>
   United confirmed the engine failure, but spokesman Joe Hopkins
refused to comment on the incident.
</P>
<P>
   Madison Walton, spokesman for the Air Line Pilots' Association's
United unit, said the union and the carrier have each appointed
five pilots to a committee to study the incident and make
recommendations.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't just disregard incidents like this,'' he said. ``We
take them seriously and address them in depth.''
</P>
<P>
   United produced a safety videotape analyzing the crew's actions
and has required its 9,500 pilots to watch it. It has also required
that pilots of the 747-400 return to its Denver training center for
a three-day proficiency check twice a year rather than once a year,
as do pilots of its other airplanes.
</P>
<P>
   The FAA also reacted. The agency initially ordered United to
make sure its 747-400 pilots had at least three takeoffs and
landings in the plane every 90 days. When United said it would have
to cancel flights, the agency cut its demand to one real takeoff
and landing and two on the simulator, said Allison Duquette, an FAA
spokeswoman. The renegotiated FAA requirement is an interim
measure, Walton said, and may be strengthened in the future.

GERHARD HERZBERG, 94, NOBEL WINNER FOR MOLECULAR RESEARCH 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Canada)  (js) 
 By WOLFGANG SAXON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dr. Gerhard Herzberg, winner of the 1971 Nobel Prize in
Chemistry for research into the structure of molecules, died on
March 3 at his home in Ottawa. He was 94.
</P>
<P>
   Herzberg was known as the creator of modern molecular
spectroscopy, which uses optical instruments to measure the
characteristics of light emitted or absorbed by molecules and
atoms. He spent most of his career with the National Research
Council of Canada and retired formally in 1994, with the title of
senior research scientist.
</P>
<P>
   In making its award, the Nobel Prize jury cited ``his
contributions to the knowledge of electronic structure and geometry
of molecules, particularly free radicals.'' Free radicals are
fragments of molecules that are highly reactive and combine easily
with other molecules.
</P>
<P>
   Herzberg's three-volume ``Molecular Spectra and Molecular
Structure,'' still in print, won him recognition in chemical
laboratories everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   He had made his own laboratory in Ottawa, the Nobel jury said,
the world's foremost center for molecular spectroscopy. Such
investigations, the jury added, provide extremely precise
information on molecular energies, rotations, vibrations and
electronic structures.
</P>
<P>
   After he won the prize, Herzberg said: ``I was brought up as a
physicist. But my recent work, for example, on free radicals and
molecules has been in a way more appreciated by chemists.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact his work produced important tools for investigation into
fields as diverse as physics, chemistry, astrophysics, biology and
medicine. He discovered the spectrum of methylene, a free radical
and transient intermediate molecule with a very short life span in
chemical reactions.
</P>
<P>
   For astronomers, his accomplishments meant surer knowledge of
stars and planets' atmospheres. And his research on spectroscopic
properties and electronic structure led the way to precise quantum
mechanical descriptions of small molecules.
</P>
<P>
   Fellow scientists viewed Herzberg as a kind of gift from Nazi
Germany to the free world. Like many others from central Europe, he
sought refuge in the West from the Nazis.
</P>
<P>
   He was born in Hamburg and educated at the Darmstadt Institute
of Technology and the Universities of Gottingen in Germany and in
Bristol, England, where he received a doctorate in physics in 1928.
</P>
<P>
   He started as a lecturer at Darmstadt but left in 1935 for the
University of Saskatchewan and a research professorship in physics.
</P>
<P>
   In 1948, after three years as a professor of spectroscopy at the
Yerkes Observatory of the University of Chicago, he joined the
staff of National Research Council of Canada, and made it his
professional home for the next 46 years.
</P>
<P>
   He received many honors in addition to the Nobel. His honorary
doctorates came from as far away as Oxford, Stockholm, Frankfurt
and Delhi. When the government research center in Ottawa added an
Institute of Astrophysics in 1975, it was named in his honor.
</P>
<P>
   Surviving are his wife of 27 years, Monika Tenthoff Herzberg,
and a son and daughter from his first marriage, to the late Luise
Oettinger Herzberg: Paul, of Toronto, and Agnes, of Kingston,
Ontario.

   They come to scream at heartthrobs like Tom Cruise, Kurt Russell

   They come from as far away as Jupiter, Fla., St. Louis and even
Frankfurt, Germany.

<P>
   The line of campers waiting for seats in the bleachers outside

</P>
<P>
   It says so on the sign they put up by their first-in-line tent

   ``After Christmas is over, we start planning to come,''
Churchill, 68, a Chino resident, said Friday.

   How early do you have to set up camp to be the first in line?
``We came on Sunday,'' said Stratton, 56, of San Diego.

motels.
</P>
<P>
   Come Sunday morning, they'll pack everything back into their
cars before they are let into the bleachers wearing their lime
green Bleacher Creature T-shirts.
</P>
<P>
   Next to them on the sidewalk was the ``Oscar Chatter Club,''
which revolves around a 2-year-old newsletter put out by 16-year
Oscars veteran Tina Hernandez of Huntington Beach, who was
expecting 30 fans in her group.
</P>
<P>
   ``You get together with friends,'' she said, standing by a table
holding four or five little plastic Oscar statuettes and
movie-related books. ``It's a reunion.''
</P>
<P>
   She was looking forward to seeing Roberto Benigni of ``Life Is
Beautiful. ``He's going to brighten up the whole show.''
</P>
<P>
   Her group included Kathy and Bill Franks of Jupiter, Fla. ``My
big favorite is Tom Cruise,'' said Kathy Franks, 39. Two years ago
in the bleachers she screamed his name so loudly he finally turned
and acknowledged her, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was one of the most exciting moments,'' said Franks.
</P>
<P>
   Susanne Wolf and Silvia Farag may win the prize for longest
distance traveled by fans. They came from Frankfurt, Germany _ Wolf
for the fifth time and Farag for the third.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole year I count off the days,'' said Wolf, a huge Jodie
Foster fan who was wearing a Melissa Etheridge T-shirt. ``I think,
280 days, 279 days. My colleagues at work ask me how many days.''
</P>
<P>
   Farag said she actually prefers the camping out to the cavalcade
of stars on Sunday. ``It's a party, and you meet a lot of nice
people,'' she said as they headed back to the youth hostel in Santa
Monica to shower and change clothes.
</P>
<P>
   By 1 p.m. Friday, about 10 tents stretched from Stratton and
Churchill's site east on Hope, then around the corner onto Temple.
But some sites marked off with tape weren't yet occupied.
</P>
<P>
   Television crews and print reporters from around the world
interviewed the fans. The fans relaxed, ate and showed off
photographs from last year's Academy Awards.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd love to see Goldie Hawn and Kurt Russell,'' said Jill
Cornelli of St. Louis. ``They're such a cute couple.''

EDITORIAL OBSERVER: SEARCHING FOR GRAVES _ AND JUSTICE _ IN TULSA 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Okla., Texas, Ill., Neb., D.C.)  (js) 
 By BRENT STAPLES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   The mention of mass graves brings to mind the genocidal wars
that have bloodied Bosnia, Rwanda and Central America. But at its
meeting Friday, a state commission in Oklahoma discussed its search
for mass burials along the Arkansas River in downtown Tulsa and
elsewhere in the city. The panel, the Tulsa Race Riot Commission,
was created by the state legislature in 1997 to investigate
violence that swept the city in 1921. In less than one day, rioting
whites killed perhaps as many as 200 to 300 black citizens, burned
more than 1,000 residences and razed one of the most prosperous
business districts in the Southwest.
</P>
<P>
   The exact casualty figures and property losses were obscured in
a cover-up that kept the riot out of polite conversation and school
history textbooks for nearly half a century. But with its report
due out in the fall, the commission will substantially expand what
Tulsans know about a bloody night almost 78 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Many Americans associate racial disturbances with the 1960s. But
the period between 1919 and 1921 was more viciously violent by far,
due partly to dramatic shifts in the demography of race. Black
workers who had been historically confined to cotton fields in the
South had begun to move north and compete with whites for factory
jobs _ often as strike-breakers, which was the only way many could
get hired. In addition, black veterans returned from World War I
insisting on the civil rights that Americans had fought and died
for in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   In Chicago, Omaha, Washington D.C. and Long View, Texas., white
mobs burned and killed in black neighborhoods. But the worst
violence occurred in the Greenwood section of Tulsa on June 1,
1921, when black families were burned alive in their homes or shot
running away. The blacks shot back. But in the end, a thriving
neighborhood of shops, hotels and gaming halls _ which Booker T.
Washington had dubbed ``the black Wall Street'' _ was left bombed
out and deserted.
</P>
<P>
   The rioters targeted affluent blacks, whom they regarded as
``uppity Negroes.'' A nationally known surgeon, A.C. Jackson, was
shot by a white teen-ager while running out of his flaming home.
Jackson bled to death on the march to a makeshift internment camp.
Thousands of black Tulsans left with what they could carry. Those
who stayed regretted it when grand juries dominated by the Ku Klux
Klan indicted ``armed colored men'' who had done little more than
defend their lives and homes.
</P>
<P>
   The riots began after a spurious rumor, repeated in a newspaper
article, that a black man had tried to rape white women in an
elevator. Historians of the riot now say that The Tulsa Tribune's
managing editor admitted to investigators just days later that an
overzealous writer had made up the story. But the most damaging
thing was an inflammatory newspaper piece whose headline survivors
recall as ``To Lynch Negro Tonight.'' The article seems to have
been deliberately expunged from remaining copies of the paper. Even
so, several survivors recall reading it at the time. The National
Guard officer in charge at the scene placed part of the blame for
the conflagration on ``yellow journalism.''
</P>
<P>
   State Rep. Don Ross grew up hearing black Tulsans smolder about
the riot and the cover-up. Two years ago Ross gathered overwhelming
support to create a commission that would ``break the conspiracy of
silence'' surrounding the riot. The resulting panel, the Race Riot
Commission, is charged with arriving at an accurate death toll and
estimate of property damage. But the commission's most sensitive
mission is to decide whether reparations are warranted and what
form they will take.
</P>
<P>
   The commission is getting results. Legal documents that were
thought to be lost have turned up, shedding light on bogus
prosecutions stemming from the riot. Newly found survivors have
been interviewed, among them a white man who testified before the
panel that he had been a teen-ager during the Greenwood disturbance
riding the riot zone while hostile whites hunted down Negroes.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the Riot Commission said earlier this month that
excavators had been probing for bodies of riot victims at the edges
of existing cemeteries and suspect that there may be mass graves at
at least three sites. The commission is particularly interested in
the 11th Street area of the Arkansas River, where witnesses say
they saw Guardsmen hurling bodies into the water.
</P>
<P>
   The commission has found that bodies were stored temporarily on
a sand bar in the river and then probably buried when no one came
to claim them. One possibility is that graves were dug somewhere
nearby, perhaps on the riverbank. The area is being searched with
ground-penetrating radar. Any bodies that turn up will be exhumed
and examined. That work will fall to the forensic anthropologist,
Dr. Clyde Snow, who has investigated massacres in Latin America,
Africa, Asia and the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   No one expects the story to end soon. After eight decades of
silence, Tulsans are talking about June 1921 and are nowhere near
ready to stop.

SONICS STUMBLE ON ROAD AGAIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By RONALD TILLERY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   OAKLAND, Calif. _ To say that the Sonics experience uneasy times
away from KeyArena would be putting their situation mildly.
</P>
<P>
   The road has been downright brutal.
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, the Sonics could blame their 3-7 road record
on the absence of simple basketball luck, having lost several tight
games in the final two minutes. However, about the only thing
gut-wrenching about Friday night's 90-78 loss to Golden State at
Oakland Arena was the Sonics' performance.
</P>
<P>
   In having their three-game losing streak snapped, the Sonics
brought very little to the court.
</P>
<P>
   No intensity. No baskets. No answer for a Golden State team that
had lost four straight but dominated from start to finish.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have not done the little things,'' said Sonics forward
Detlef Schrempf, who led the team with 21 points off the bench.
``We do a lot of the little things wrong when on the road you need
everything to win.''
</P>
<P>
   With point guard Gary Payton shooting 5 of 19, the Sonics played
with a huge void in their offense. The team shot just 34 percent
and tied a season-low with 23 field goals.
</P>
<P>
   Payton had company in the shooting doldrums.
</P>
<P>
   Vin Baker was 2-for-11 and Dale Ellis missed all eight of his
shots.
</P>
<P>
   One would have never known that the Sonics were coming off two
days' rest.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we make shots it's a ballgame,'' Ellis said. `` ... We're
just not getting it done. We're just too inconsistent.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics knew they were in for a long night from the start.
</P>
<P>
   After Payton hit a 3-pointer that put the Sonics ahead 3-0,
Seattle missed its next eight shots.
</P>
<P>
   Golden State went on a monstrous 16-0 run, scoring effortlessly
from inside and out. The Warriors were particularly forceful around
the rim while the Sonics seemed flatfooted.
</P>
<P>
   A perfect example was when 5-foot-3 Muggsy Bogues rebounded
Antawn Jamison's missed jumper. Bogues then fed Jamison, who cut to
the basket for an easy layup. The Sonics fell behind 26-9 on that
play, and they managed to score just 15 points in the opening
period.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are a fast-starting team. We watched them on tape,''
Schrempf said. `` ... That (first quarter) set the tone.''
</P>
<P>
   Golden State's younger legs and aggressive play kept the Sonics
befuddled. The Warriors twice held 19-point leads in the second
quarter. Although the Sonics cut the deficit to 51-40 at the break,
the Warriors never relinquished a double-digit lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no acceptable explanation _ we respected the
Warriors,'' Sonics coach Paul Westphal said. ``We didn't come in
thinking they couldn't take it to us. They've been a real
successful team at home. ... There's no reason not to match their
aggressiveness, but we didn't.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics finally welcomed back swingman Billy Owens, who
played after missing the past two games with a sore left knee. But
Owens did little to help. He played just four minutes and collected
two points _ all in the first half.
</P>
<P>
   Westphal frantically searched for someone to provide energy so
he inserted rookie Vladimir Stepania in the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Stepania's energy _ on the boards and defensively _ compelled
Westphal to start him in place of Ellis in the second half.
Westphal, who searched for a sparkplug all night, even used
19-year-old rookie Rashard Lewis when Stepania got into foul
trouble with 8:22 left in the third.
</P>
<P>
   ``We needed some energy,'' Westphal said. ``We were sleepwalking
out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Stepania gave the Sonics somewhat of a lift. Asked whether the
6-foot-11 forward would receive more playing time, Westphal said:
``I would think so. If a guy hustles as much as he does, we'll have
to find a place for him.''
</P>
<P>
   Stepania might be called upon to fulfill Baker's role.
</P>
<P>
   Baker also did not start the second half after suffering a
sprained right thumb in the second quarter. He went back on the
floor with 5:37 left in the third.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to win the game,'' said Baker, who was in pain after
the game. ``It was hurting, but it would have been hurting worse
just sitting there.''
</P>
<P>
   Baker said he had already been advised to rest his injury three
to four days.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I'm not going to wait,'' Baker said.
</P>
<P>
   And the Sonics can't continue their lull on the road.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's time to win on the road,'' Baker said. ``Teams are
playing well against us when we come to their gym. ... Regardless
of our record, teams come ready to play the Sonics. We have to
match their intensity.''

FIRM'S `SNIFFER' UNITS FRAGRANT WITH POTENTIAL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY BEN SULLIVAN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Five years ago, over frankfurters and beer at a
hot dog stand, aerospace consultants David Haberman and David
Walker decided to take a chance.
</P>
<P>
   The pair had learned of a technology developed at Sandia
National Laboratory in New Mexico and available for
commercialization that used an air-sniffing computer chip to detect
hydrogen gas. Believing hydrogen would play a growing role in
industry, and that existing sensors were too expensive and bulky to
keep pace, Walker and Haberman created DCH Technology Inc. to bring
the technology to market.
</P>
<P>
   The rest, as they say, is history.
</P>
<P>
   Well, not quite. After five years, the Valencia-based company's
three standard-bearer products are starting to gain acceptance. But
so far, DCH has generated little in the way of sales, with 1998
revenues of $215,000 and a net loss of more than $4 million. The
company's stock, which peaked as high $8.25 following its initial
public offering in 1996, closed Friday at $1.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Walker and Haberman say they are confident of the firm's
prospects. ``We have no debt, the founders remain in control of the
company and our products are quite good,'' said Haberman, DCH's
chairman and vice president of planning.
</P>
<P>
   At least a few others agree. James Stock's Stock Tips, a Las
Vegas-based investor newsletter, declared the company was ``farther
along than they've ever been to meeting their corporate goals'' and
said it may be one of the market's best-kept secrets.
</P>
<P>
   At the heart of the DCH game plan is the sensor chip itself.
Developed at Sandia, a U.S. Department of Energy research lab, it
consists of a thin layer of palladium nickel alloy sandwiched on
top of an integrated circuit. When it comes into contact with
hydrogen atoms, even at minute levels, the alloy spits protons
directly into the integrated circuit's logic cells.
</P>
<P>
   Using that same basic technology, DCH has developed a hand-held
device for hunting down leaks, a model for installation on
hydrogen-powered devices, and a version for use in permanent
locales where hydrogen might seep out, such as at a nuclear power
plant or waste-treatment center. Together, the three applications
have a potential market of $200 million, the company estimates.
</P>
<P>
   By outsourcing the manufacturing of the sensors to industrial
giant Allied Signal, DCH has managed to keep its staff and capital
investments down. The company's staff of 11 consists primarily of
engineers working to refine the sensor and develop new
applications.
</P>
<P>
   Haberman and Walker, meanwhile, have been working to
establishing relationships with a bevy of blue chip names they hope
will result in 1999 sales of between $3 million and $4 million. A
DCH sensor flew aboard a NASA space shuttle mission last year to
test the device's extraterrestrial applications. Westinghouse
recently certified the technology for use at a Russian nuclear
power plant it is retrofitting. And Northrup Grumman Corp. is using
DCH products in its metallurgy division. Other customers include
Ford Motor Co., Lockheed Martin Defense Systems and the U.S. Naval
Medical Research Institute.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the fact remains that demand for hydrogen sensors of any
sort is limited. While the element is a key ingredient in the fuel
cells that environmentalists believe will one day power cars,
hydrogen sensor sales currently total in the thousands worldwide,
not millions. But if just two or three companies opted to include
DCH devices on a broad basis -- say, in every fuel-cell car Ford
produces -- it would mean a windfall for the company, Haberman
said.
</P>
<P>
   With increased sniffing of DCH by investors and customers alike,
Haberman said things look positive. ``We've been distinctly poor at
communications . . . but the neat part is the phone keeps ringing''
from potential customers, he said. ``It just seems like
everything's clicking and coming together.''

dropping an assisted-suicide charge. That means the dead man's
family will not be allowed to testify as to how sick he was, and
that could improve the chances for a conviction. (This was the
death that was shown on ``60 Minutes.'' In the videotape, Kevorkian
is shown injecting drugs into the man after he talks about how he
is ready to die.) By Pam Belluck.

   OSCARS-HOLIDAY (Los Angeles) _ For the creme de la few in this

bow down before a 13-and-a-half-inch gold-plated idol named Oscar.

F. Mac Buckley, turned on the charm that had made him one of
Connecticut's best-known criminal defense attorneys. Messenger now

   WASHINGTON _ It's a far cry from the space-based, rocket-zapping
shield that President Ronald Reagan envisioned 16 years ago in the
depths of the Cold War. But the country is suddenly jettisoning its
qualms about forging a national missile defense and is moving fast
toward building one.
</P>
<P>
   The threat is not an all-out strike from thousands of Soviet
missiles, which prompted Reagan to propose the anti-missile program
popularly known as ``Star Wars'' in 1983. The fear now is that
rogue nations like North Korea or Iran, with little or no warning,
could lob a devastating missile or two into Los Angeles or Seattle.
This anxiety has been heightened by suspicions that China stole
U.S. nuclear secrets in the 1980s to enhance its small nuclear
arsenal.
</P>
<P>
   Such developments helped prompt the Senate and House last week
to vote overwhelmingly in favor of anti-missile defenses as a
matter of national policy, while stopping short of actually
appropriating money for construction. Even the White House has
reversed its opposition to the legislation, lending conditional
support and pledging $10.5 billion in preliminary funding over the
next six years. Clearly, pressure is mounting on President Clinton
to actually build a system, once proven feasible, and he says he
will decide by June 2000.
</P>
<P>
   There are two surprises here. One is that anti-missile defenses,
once strongly opposed and even ridiculed by Democrats and others,
seem to be almost magically melting away as a domestic political
issue. The second is that anti-missile defenses are more
contentious than ever as an international political issue _ even
with Russia, America's main nuclear rival, in eclipse.
</P>
<P>
   Moscow is now threatening to stop reducing its 7,000-warhead
arsenal if the United States breaks out of the 1972 Anti-Ballistic
Missile Treaty, which bars national defensive systems. China,
meanwhile, says fielding missile defenses in Asia could seriously
escalate tensions over Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   With Russian Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov arriving in
Washington on Tuesday for talks, and Chinese Prime Minister Zhu
Rongji due in Washington in early April, Clinton's foreign policy
aides are bracing for a rough few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   But first, why are things growing quiet on the domestic front?
</P>
<P>
   For years, Republicans from Reagan onward tried to make missile
defenses a national priority _ in an era when the threat of attack
was arguably much bigger than it is now _ and for years they were
opposed and even scoffed at by less hawkish opponents.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, however, a string of startling events prompted a sea
change. A bipartisan commission headed by former Defense Secretary
Donald Rumsfeld, a Republican, warned in July that within five
years, North Korea and Iran could have the potential to hit the
United States with a ballistic missile.
</P>
<P>
   Six weeks later, as if on cue, North Korea stunned U.S.
intelligence analysts by test-launching a three-stage missile with
conceivably enough range to hit North America.
</P>
<P>
   Congressional Republicans claimed vindication, and those claims
have been enhanced lately by opinion polls showing that the public
trusts Republicans over Democrats in matters of national security.
</P>
<P>
   Shaken by the developments, many Democrats have been rethinking
their opposition to missile defenses. And the ambitious plans for
such defenses have been scaled back _ brought, literally, down to
earth _ beginning with plans for about 20 interceptors that could
shoot down a handful of missiles.
</P>
<P>
   A crucial, recent convert is Sen. Bob Kerrey of Nebraska, the
ranking Democrat on the Intelligence Committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Aug. 31 launch was a watershed moment,'' Kerrey said.
``There is a growing recognition that there's a real danger of
proliferation that produces either an accidental launching or an
attack by a rogue nation.''
</P>
<P>
   Kerrey pulled along other centrist Democrats in support of the
Republican-sponsored bill that passed in the Senate last week.
Fearing that the votes weren't there to sustain a presidential
veto, the White House and Senate Democratic leaders settled for two
face-saving amendments that seek to control the cost of any system
and to insure arms control talks with Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a change in Democratic ideology,'' said Frank Luntz, a
Republican pollster. ``The old-fashioned Democratic doves of the
1970s are giving way to centrists who are less hostile to
defense.''
</P>
<P>
   That is not to say that all Democrats have bought into missile
defenses. In fact, half the House Democrats opposed such a move
last week. After $55 billion invested in developing a national
system since the early 1980s (when the Reagan administration
creatively interpreted the ABM treaty to allow research), the
technology is still unproven. Moreover, detractors say, terrorists
and despots could thwart a sophisticated missile defense with other
weapons of terror.
</P>
<P>
   ``It could be bypassed with suitcase bombs, pickup trucks and
sea-launched missiles,'' said Rep. Rush Holt, D-N.J., who is a
physicist. ``It would be billions of dollars down the drain.''
</P>
<P>
   Pentagon brass dismiss the naysayers, arguing that military
contractors and engineers will work out the technical kinks and, by
2005, field a limited system of radars and missile-killing
interceptors _ perhaps in Alaska, North Dakota or on ships at sea _
if Clinton gives the go-ahead.

</P>
<P>
   The fast-emerging consensus for missile defenses at home,
however, collides with growing anxiety abroad, particularly in
Beijing and Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   Russia has long opposed a U.S. missile defense system, fearing
that Washington would use it as an excuse to reprise the much
grander Star Wars, which would be dauntingly expensive to match.
</P>
<P>
   While the anti-missile issue is of little concern to ordinary
Russians struggling with dire economic conditions, it is core
national security for Russian politicians, and a matter of
considerable national self-esteem.
</P>
<P>
   With the United States moving ahead on such a system, Russian
nationalists could use the argument that Russia was losing its
nuclear deterrent _ since an anti-missile defense could encourage a
nation with one (that is, the United States) to risk a nuclear
exchange. That argument could undercut, for example, efforts by the
Russian Parliament to ratify the second strategic arms reduction
treaty between the two countries, or Start 2.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's Foreign Ministry warned after last week's U.S. Senate
vote that building even a limited system ``poses a serious threat
to the whole process of nuclear arms control, as well as strategic
stability.''
</P>
<P>
   And for this reason, arms control advocates are nervous about
doing anything to upset further nuclear arms reductions with
Russia. After all, they say, North Korea may threaten America with
one to five missiles, but instability in Russia is a much greater
risk. ``Our overwhelming and sustained concern has to be Russia,''
said Sen. Joseph Biden, D-Del., who voted reluctantly for the
Senate measure. ``They got the most, they got the biggest, and they
got the most accurate.''
</P>
<P>
   But Republicans and a growing number of Democrats say that
building an anti-missile system is just as necessary to insure a
safer world as reducing Moscow's nuclear stockpile, which is
declining with or without a treaty because Russia no longer can
afford to maintain it at Cold War levels.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a delicate balance with Russia,'' said Paul Wolfowitz, a
senior Pentagon official under President George Bush and a member
of the Rumsfeld panel. ``We don't want to alienate the Russians,
but on the other hand we can't let them bully us.''
</P>
<P>
   In Asia, U.S.-Japanese plans to develop a missile system to
defend Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and the U.S. troops in the region
got under way about a decade ago, in anticipation of the possible
missile threat from North Korea.
</P>
<P>
   As that threat has become more real, the plans to defend against
it have encountered growing criticism from China _ and even from
key allies. Two weeks ago, South Korea's defense minister said a
joint U.S.-Japanese missile defense would be ineffective against
North Korean missiles, and added that his government would not help
pay for it.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is the possibility that such an anti-missile system
might not be ready for years, when there is at least a chance that
there won't be a North Korea left to worry about. This is a point
not lost on China, which views the proposed missile umbrella
primarily as a threat to its plans to reunify Taiwan with the
Chinese mainland. Since the early 1990s, China has more or less
doubled, to several hundred, the number of missiles on the Chinese
coast pointed at Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   The fear among many national security analysts in Asia is that
missile defenses could do to China what the creation of NATO did to
the Soviet Union: help to trigger a new escalation of arms.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we are for the development of advanced missile defense
systems, we are going to touch off new rounds of an arms race,''
said He Yafei, a senior Chinese diplomat in Washington who has long
experience in arms control.
</P>
<P>
   And the idea of including Taiwan under any missile umbrella ``is
an obstruction on our course of unification of our motherland,'' he
added. ``Taiwan is part of China. Politically, that is an
interference, a very serious interference in our internal
affairs.''

   With the United States moving ahead on such a system, Russian
nationalists could use the argument that Russia was losing its
nuclear deterrent _ since an anti-missile defense could encourage a
nation with one (that is, the United States) to risk a nuclear
exchange. That argument could undercut, for example, efforts by the
Russian Parliament to ratify the second strategic arms reduction
treaty between the two countries, or Start 2.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's Foreign Ministry warned after last week's U.S. Senate
vote that building even a limited system ``poses a serious threat
to the whole process of nuclear arms control, as well as strategic
stability.''
</P>
<P>
   And for this reason, arms control advocates are nervous about
doing anything to upset further nuclear arms reductions with
Russia. After all, they say, North Korea may threaten America with
one to five missiles, but instability in Russia is a much greater
risk. ``Our overwhelming and sustained concern has to be Russia,''
said Sen. Joseph Biden, D-Del., who voted reluctantly for the
Senate measure. ``They got the most, they got the biggest, and they
got the most accurate.''
</P>
<P>
   But Republicans and a growing number of Democrats say that
building an anti-missile system is just as necessary to insure a
safer world as reducing Moscow's nuclear stockpile, which is
declining with or without a treaty because Russia no longer can
afford to maintain it at Cold War levels.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a delicate balance with Russia,'' said Paul Wolfowitz, a
senior Pentagon official under President George Bush and a member
of the Rumsfeld panel. ``We don't want to alienate the Russians,
but on the other hand we can't let them bully us.''
</P>
<P>
   In Asia, U.S.-Japanese plans to develop a missile system to
defend Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and the U.S. troops in the region
got under way about a decade ago, in anticipation of the possible
missile threat from North Korea.
</P>
<P>
   As that threat has become more real, the plans to defend against
it have encountered growing criticism from China _ and even from
key allies. Two weeks ago, South Korea's defense minister said a
joint U.S.-Japanese missile defense would be ineffective against
North Korean missiles, and added that his government would not help
pay for it.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is the possibility that such an anti-missile system
might not be ready for years, when there is at least a chance that
there won't be a North Korea left to worry about. This is a point
not lost on China, which views the proposed missile umbrella
primarily as a threat to its plans to reunify Taiwan with the
Chinese mainland. Since the early 1990s, China has more or less
doubled, to several hundred, the number of missiles on the Chinese
coast pointed at Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   The fear among many national security analysts in Asia is that
missile defenses could do to China what the creation of NATO did to
the Soviet Union: help to trigger a new escalation of arms.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we are for the development of advanced missile defense
systems, we are going to touch off new rounds of an arms race,''
said He Yafei, a senior Chinese diplomat in Washington who has long
experience in arms control.
</P>
<P>
   And the idea of including Taiwan under any missile umbrella ``is
an obstruction on our course of unification of our motherland,'' he
added. ``Taiwan is part of China. Politically, that is an
interference, a very serious interference in our internal
affairs.''

<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average floats near 10,000. Jobs are
plentiful. Wages are rising. Spending is everywhere. The economy
booms, month after month. And nothing seems to shake the public
sense of prosperity. So why are the oracles of the economy talking
like Nervous Nellies?
</P>
<P>
   Listen to Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan, who
told Congress in February that the economy ``appears stretched in a
number of dimensions.'' That on top of his insistence last
September that America cannot remain an ``oasis of prosperity.''
</P>
<P>
   Or hear out stock market guru Warren Buffett, who said on
national television not three weeks ago: ``The level of speculation
is high by any historic standard. And you know that doesn't go on
forever.''
</P>
<P>
   Or worry with Robert M. Solow, a Nobel laureate in economics,
who said in an interview last week: ``We have had three awfully
good years now, and an incredible fourth quarter. But any setback
can start the dominoes falling. Who knows what's next.''
</P>
<P>
   The nervousness, in fact, may be appropriate. This is hardly a
standard, predictable boom. Normally, there is a beginning, middle
and end _ the typical post-World War II experience. After a
recession or period of sluggish growth, spending picks up and so
does investment. Low-interest loans and more jobs help the process
along, and the economy expands briskly.
</P>
<P>
   In time, however, people find themselves pressed financially.
Worried, they slow their spending, and investment drops off. Or
shortages develop, prices rise and the Federal Reserve, fearing too
much inflation, raises interest rates to discourage the borrowing
that sustains good times. Either way, sluggish growth returns, or a
recession sets in.
</P>
<P>
   But the boom that started in late 1995 broke this pattern. It is
like a perpetual-motion machine, each part keeping the others
moving _ and moving indefinitely, many Americans have come to
believe.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is this sense that we don't have to worry about problems
or adverse conditions,'' said Richard Curtin, director of the
University of Michigan's Consumer Surveys. A ``virtuous circle,''
economists call the new machinery.
</P>
<P>
   The trouble is, if one part malfunctions, or breaks, the whole
contraption may collapse. ``A vicious circle would replace the
virtuous one,'' Solow said, ``and feed on itself.''
</P>
<P>
   The perpetual-motion economy, in brief outline, works this way:
The rising stock market generates the household wealth that
encourages the borrowing that pays for the spending that creates
the jobs and the higher wages that generate the confidence that
encourages people to invest in stocks and make the market rise some
more.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many of us who have been doubters are starting to believe that
this thing can go on forever,'' said Stephen Roach, chief economist
at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter. ``That is a complacency we may live
to regret. But I cannot really substantiate doubt for a good
analytic reason.''
</P>
<P>
   The stock market, a secondary player in standard booms, is the
biggest cog this time around. As stock prices have shot up,
household wealth has more than doubled in recent years. Wages have
risen, but not nearly as fast as the rise in household wealth. And
people are spending their new wealth, either by selling stock or
borrowing against it. Not that the stock is the actual collateral.
Instead, millions of people are putting up their homes as
collateral, but with the thought, say lenders and economists, that
they can sell stock to repay debt if necessary.
</P>
<P>
   ``The stock market has become a way of extracting equity from
housing,'' said Wynne Godley, an economist at the Jerome Levy
Institute.
</P>
<P>
   Mortgage and home equity loans, as a result, are the
fastest-rising form of consumer debt in recent months, the Federal
Reserve reports. Why not? After all, stock prices won't go down
that much, in the view of many Americans. ``God, if we could only
bottle all this confidence,'' Curtin said.
</P>
<P>
   The perpetual-motion economy has other intriguing components.
Inflation has stayed low, depriving the Federal Reserve of a reason
to raise interest rates and provoke a slowdown. One big reason for
the low inflation: Businesses here and abroad are producing more
than people want to buy, even high-spending Americans. Oil and raw
materials are particularly inexpensive, and the competition to sell
all the excess production holds down prices. Not even a low
unemployment rate and rising wages offset this downward pressure on
prices.
</P>
<P>
   The low inflation, in turn, produces low interest rates, which
encourage people to borrow and spend on home construction, for
example, and autos. Jobs are created, wages rise, confidence
flourishes and more money is invested in the stock market, creating
more wealth for households to borrow against. The flywheel keeps
turning.
</P>
<P>
   The global economic slowdown offers a separate contribution to
this self-perpetuating mechanism. Asia's economies, including
Japan's, are hurting. Europe is not particularly robust either. So
corporate Asia and corporate Europe have turned to America, selling
their merchandise here at what amounts to discount prices, helping
to keep inflation down.
</P>
<P>
   There is one more link in this circle: Foreign investors take
some of the dollars earned here and, rather than invest them back
home, buy American securities, including stocks _ and share prices
rise.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the boom in America that seems so enduring will come
to an ironic end,'' said John Makin, an economist and senior fellow
at the American Enterprise Institute. ``As the rest of the world
does better, that will put a cap on things here for a while.''
</P>
<P>
   Makin is rather mild in his nervousness. So are Joel Prakken and
Chris Varvares, partners at Macroeconomic Advisers, a forecasting
firm in St. Louis. They see a gradual slowdown ahead because they
believe stock prices will stop rising this year, and interest rates
might edge up a bit.
</P>
<P>
   But they don't see stock prices falling sharply enough to halt
the perpetual-motion economy. Average stock prices would have to
fall at least 30 percent and stay down for at least six months, an
unlikely event in the view of most Wall Street economists and
certainly in the view of many shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   The Nervous Nellies are not mollified. What really seems to
worry them is a new article of faith on Wall Street and among many
Americans that if stock prices really drop, the Federal Reserve
will save the day by lowering interest rates, thus adding fresh
impetus to the perpetual-motion machine.
</P>
<P>
   Such an optimistic expectation annoys Fed officials. One of
Greenspan's top lieutenants, Michael Prell, the director of
research, made the point in a recent speech.
</P>
<P>
   ``Might people _ business managers, consumers, investors _ be
taking risks that they would not have taken were it not for an
exaggerated confidence in the ability of the Fed to cushion the
economy and financial markets against any and all shocks?'' Prell
asked. ``If so, there conceivably could be a greater potential
instability in the system than is readily apparent at this time.''

 By RICHARD L. BERKE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ First he decried the evils of traffic congestion.
Then he vowed to do something about cow manure that pollutes
streams. Then he called for larger print on over-the-counter drug
labels.
</P>
<P>
   This wasn't the mayor of Los Angeles or a county agriculture
commissioner or a pharmacist in Sarasota, Fla. This was the vice
president of the United States, Al Gore, unveiling his latest
initiatives recently as he competes for the Democratic presidential
nomination.
</P>
<P>
   If President Clinton transformed the presidency (some say shrank
it) from a wellspring of grand ideas to one of itsy-bitsy
proposals, his vice president has gone further. Forget the
bite-size morsels like school uniforms that Clinton doled out four
years ago. To some, Gore is serving up crumbs.
</P>
<P>
   Well beyond Gore, the smaller-is-better movement threatens to
infiltrate American political discourse. A favorite line of
Republican presidential aspirant Elizabeth Dole is her boast about
how, as transportation secretary, she championed emergency aisle
safety lights on airplanes.
</P>
<P>
   These appeals to everyday life may reflect a radical change in
what people expect from their president. They may also be spurred
by an inward-looking culture in which Americans are relatively
content and more preoccupied with challenges of their daily lives
than with the less tangible state of the country.
</P>
<P>
   But that some leading politicians are as eager to talk about
tiny things as they are about grand matters of war and taxes may
also reflect an era of caution. Humbled, for example, by the
spectacular collapse of Clinton's huge health care overhaul,
politicians these days may be more inclined to propose sure-fire
initiatives than more ambitious or imaginative ones that may be
difficult to enact. These candidates may also be encouraging voters
to hold low expectations about what government can actually
accomplish.
</P>
<P>
   Even in areas like health care, where there is general agreement
that the system needs an overhaul, political polarization stands in
the way of any meaningful changes.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is more risk in proposing big changes _ it's harder to
get it done,'' said Sen. Bob Kerrey, D-Neb. ``And there is in life
a general and very understandable tendency to make an assessment of
what can be done and work on that. I've been working on
entitlements since 1993. I think we're making progress. But it's
not something we can put on a press release.''
</P>
<P>
   Former Sen. Bill Bradley, D-N.J., who is thus far Gore's only
rival for the nomination, derides the concept of baby proposals,
asserting that as president his priority would be ``to cultivate 10
strong oaks rather than sprinkling water on a thousand house
plants.'' Bradley speaks ambitiously of rescuing the quarter of
American children living in poverty and tackling the deepening
crises in Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, to be sure, talks about big things. But he risks becoming
known as parochial _ as Mayor Al _ when he dwells on matters that
his predecessors would never have raised.
</P>
<P>
   He produced titters for proposing an ``Airline Passenger Bill of
Rights,'' that calls for such things as increasing the compensation
for lost baggage. Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., a prospect for the
Republican presidential nomination, actually came up with the idea
first.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, Kerrey said, he did a radio show in Omaha, Neb., and
the announcers started laughing when the subject of the Airline
Passenger Bill of Rights came up. ``Jesus! I'm sure there's a need
there somewhere,'' Kerrey said. ``But it makes me a little
uncomfortable as an American.'' Mocking the measure, he said, ``All
of a sudden, I'm going to pass a law saying, `Give me sparkling
water instead of plain water!'''
</P>
<P>
   Yet Gore may be practicing smart politics. A common frustration
of elected officials is that they cannot break through and explain
to voters how what they do touches people's daily lives. So when
Clinton in 1996 made small-bore ideas a centerpiece of his
campaign, voters rewarded him. Pollsters have also found that there
is a surge in potential voters who are part of an upper middle
class; these proposals are designed to appeal to them.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president is particularly well placed to promote these
ideas because he and Clinton can dream up _ and announce _ all
sorts of executive decrees that do not require congressional
approval. (Democrats are generally more eager than Republicans to
want to impose new government regulations.)
</P>
<P>
   But Gore and his loyalists warn that matters that to some appear
trivial may, in the eyes of others actually loom large. ``There
seems to be a difference of perspective between politicians and
journalistic elites on the one hand and the American people on the
other as to what counts as an idea that's large enough to be
meaningful,'' said William Galston, a professor of public affairs
at the University of Maryland who was a domestic policy official in
the early days of the Clinton administration.
</P>
<P>
   Galston, a longtime adviser to Gore, added that politicians need
to adjust to the changing times. ``There is no reason to believe
that Bill Clinton was harmed in any way in 1995 and 1996 by
addressing issues that during the cold war might not have been seen
as presidential,'' he said. ``Obviously, you can go too far down
that road. These are questions of judgment.''
</P>
<P>
   Alex Castellanos, a Republican consultant, said, ``Our next
president is not going to be Gore or small-minded Republicans. It's
going to be the candidate with one big idea. That's what America is
hungry for.''
</P>
<P>
   But just what constitutes a big idea these days? Gore asserted
that the next president will understand ``how tired working parents
are'' and that they do not want to be ``caught in traffic jams.''
For frazzled working parents with interminable commutes _ many of
whom are important swing voters _ that may be as big an idea as
they get.

Then he vowed to do something about cow manure that pollutes
streams. Then he called for larger print on over-the-counter drug
labels.
</P>
<P>
   This wasn't the mayor of Los Angeles or a county agriculture
commissioner or a pharmacist in Sarasota, Fla. This was the vice
president of the United States, Al Gore, unveiling his latest
initiatives recently as he competes for the Democratic presidential
nomination.
</P>
<P>
   If President Clinton transformed the presidency (some say shrank
it) from a wellspring of grand ideas to one of itsy-bitsy
proposals, his vice president has gone further. Forget the
bite-size morsels like school uniforms that Clinton doled out four
years ago. To some, Gore is serving up crumbs.
</P>
<P>
   Well beyond Gore, the smaller-is-better movement threatens to
infiltrate American political discourse. A favorite line of
Republican presidential aspirant Elizabeth Dole is her boast about
how, as transportation secretary, she championed emergency aisle
safety lights on airplanes.
</P>
<P>
   These appeals to everyday life may reflect a radical change in
what people expect from their president. They may also be spurred
by an inward-looking culture in which Americans are relatively
content and more preoccupied with challenges of their daily lives
than with the less tangible state of the country.
</P>
<P>
   But that some leading politicians are as eager to talk about
tiny things as they are about grand matters of war and taxes may
also reflect an era of caution. Humbled, for example, by the
spectacular collapse of Clinton's huge health care overhaul,
politicians these days may be more inclined to propose sure-fire
initiatives than more ambitious or imaginative ones that may be
difficult to enact. These candidates may also be encouraging voters
to hold low expectations about what government can actually
accomplish.
</P>
<P>
   Even in areas like health care, where there is general agreement
that the system needs an overhaul, political polarization stands in
the way of any meaningful changes.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is more risk in proposing big changes _ it's harder to
get it done,'' said Sen. Bob Kerrey, D-Neb. ``And there is in life
a general and very understandable tendency to make an assessment of
what can be done and work on that. I've been working on
entitlements since 1993. I think we're making progress. But it's
not something we can put on a press release.''
</P>
<P>
   Former Sen. Bill Bradley, D-N.J., who is thus far Gore's only
rival for the nomination, derides the concept of baby proposals,
asserting that as president his priority would be ``to cultivate 10
strong oaks rather than sprinkling water on a thousand house
plants.'' Bradley speaks ambitiously of rescuing the quarter of
American children living in poverty and tackling the deepening
crises in Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, to be sure, talks about big things. But he risks becoming
known as parochial _ as Mayor Al _ when he dwells on matters that
his predecessors would never have raised.
</P>
<P>
   He produced titters for proposing an ``Airline Passenger Bill of
Rights,'' that calls for such things as increasing the compensation
for lost baggage. Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., a prospect for the
Republican presidential nomination, actually came up with the idea
first.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, Kerrey said, he did a radio show in Omaha, Neb., and
the announcers started laughing when the subject of the Airline
Passenger Bill of Rights came up. ``Jesus! I'm sure there's a need
there somewhere,'' Kerrey said. ``But it makes me a little
uncomfortable as an American.'' Mocking the measure, he said, ``All
of a sudden, I'm going to pass a law saying, `Give me sparkling
water instead of plain water!'''
</P>
<P>
   Yet Gore may be practicing smart politics. A common frustration
of elected officials is that they cannot break through and explain
to voters how what they do touches people's daily lives. So when
Clinton in 1996 made small-bore ideas a centerpiece of his
campaign, voters rewarded him. Pollsters have also found that there
is a surge in potential voters who are part of an upper middle
class; these proposals are designed to appeal to them.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president is particularly well placed to promote these
ideas because he and Clinton can dream up _ and announce _ all
sorts of executive decrees that do not require congressional
approval. (Democrats are generally more eager than Republicans to
want to impose new government regulations.)
</P>
<P>
   But Gore and his loyalists warn that matters that to some appear
trivial may, in the eyes of others actually loom large. ``There
seems to be a difference of perspective between politicians and
journalistic elites on the one hand and the American people on the
other as to what counts as an idea that's large enough to be
meaningful,'' said William Galston, a professor of public affairs
at the University of Maryland who was a domestic policy official in
the early days of the Clinton administration.
</P>
<P>
   Galston, a longtime adviser to Gore, added that politicians need
to adjust to the changing times. ``There is no reason to believe
that Bill Clinton was harmed in any way in 1995 and 1996 by
addressing issues that during the cold war might not have been seen
as presidential,'' he said. ``Obviously, you can go too far down
that road. These are questions of judgment.''
</P>
<P>
   Alex Castellanos, a Republican consultant, said, ``Our next
president is not going to be Gore or small-minded Republicans. It's
going to be the candidate with one big idea. That's what America is
hungry for.''
</P>
<P>
   But just what constitutes a big idea these days? Gore asserted
that the next president will understand ``how tired working parents
are'' and that they do not want to be ``caught in traffic jams.''
For frazzled working parents with interminable commutes _ many of
whom are important swing voters _ that may be as big an idea as
they get.

   WASHINGTON _ In New Jersey, former Gov. Jim Florio wants to run
for the U.S. Senate. In California, former Rep. Robert Dornan is
threatening to challenge a fellow Republican congressman. And in
New York, former Sen. Alfonse D'Amato keeps floating his name as a
candidate for his old job.
</P>
<P>
   Almost every state has them, defeated politicians trying to
reclaim old glory. Like ghosts of elections past, they rattle their
platforms and demand attention from voters, local officials and the
media. But the people they often end up scaring the most are
members of their own parties.
</P>
<P>
   In Florio's case, many of his fellow Democrats are worried that
he will end up in a replay of his loss in the 1993 gubernatorial
race to Christie Whitman, who Republicans say is leaning toward
running for the Senate next year. Voters are still angry with
Florio for raising taxes, those Democrats say, and are sure to
punish him and possibly other Democratic candidates if he runs
again.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there was someone prominent the Democrats could push
forward against Florio, someone with statewide name recognition,
they would do it,'' said Russ Baker, a professor of political
science at Rutgers University.
</P>
<P>
   Dornan, a combative conservative Republican from Orange County,
was unseated in 1996 by Loretta Sanchez, a Democrat. Dornan
disputed the results, failed, tried to get the House of
Representatives to overturn them, failed again, and then challenged
Ms. Sanchez in 1998, failing for a third time.
</P>
<P>
   Undeterred, Dornan now says he may challenge Ms. Sanchez again
next year, or possibly take on a fellow Republican, Rep. Dana
Rohrabacher, who Dornan says failed to help him in the 1998 race.
</P>
<P>
   To many Republican leaders in California, Dornan is a divisive
candidate whose attacks on immigration have hampered the party's
efforts to attract Hispanic and Asian voters. But their efforts to
block him in 1998 failed when Dornan won the primary.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could hear the groans from Republicans when he said he
might run next year,'' said Amy Walter, an editor of the Cook
Report, a nonpartisan newsletter that tracks congressional races.
</P>
<P>
   When D'Amato was ousted by Charles Schumer last year, many
political analysts chalked it up in part to voter exhaustion with
the brash three-term Republican. So when D'Amato started saying on
national television recently that running next year was ``very
tempting,'' not every New York Republican cheered.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bulk would be mortified'' if he ran again, said Norman
Adler, a political consultant who works for both Democrats and
Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   What makes people like Dornan, Florio and D'Amato hard to ignore
is their ability to move blocs of loyal voters, even small blocs.
And since only a small percentage of the electorate votes in
primaries, those loyalists can carry the day, particularly in
crowded fields.
</P>
<P>
   But why would politicians subject themselves to the rigors of a
campaign after voters had rejected them before? Political analysts
say the comeback personality usually falls into one of two
categories (and sometimes both): the vindication seeker and the
egoist.
</P>
<P>
   ``The vindication seekers are the people who lost by just a few
hundred votes, which is a very tough pill to swallow,'' said Ms.
Walter. ``They can't help thinking, `If only 200 people changed
their minds, I would win.'''
</P>
<P>
   The egoist thrives on public attention, seeming unfocused,
unfulfilled and disoriented without it. ``A lot of guys need to
reaffirm their importance,'' said Adler. ``And one way to do it is
to say, `I'm running for something.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Another thing seems to inspire not-ready-for-retirement
politicians: the examples of comeback kids who succeeded. Michael
Dukakis in Massachusetts and Bill Clinton in Arkansas were both
defeated after their first terms as governor, then won their jobs
back in the next election. And Richard M. Nixon lost the 1960
presidential campaign and 1962 California gubernatorial race before
winning sweet vindication in the 1968 presidential election.
</P>
<P>
   In each case, the defeated candidates expressed contrition for
being prideful, aloof or hard-charging, and claimed to have become
more in tune with voters' concerns, Baker said. He calls it the
``politics of epiphany.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a basic forgiveness among Americans,'' he said,
``this idea of a second chance, particularly if someone is willing
to humble himself and say they've made a mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   The politics of epiphany seems to be at the heart of Florio's
current pitch for becoming a Senate candidate. Criticized as an
intense, unemotional man who failed to sympathize with middle-class
voters' worries in 1993, Florio now says that five years as a
lawyer in private practice, battling traffic jams and navigating
government bureaucracy, has made him more empathetic to the gripes
of regular folks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a better understanding of the frantic pace of life,''
he said in a recent interview, ``the stresses and strains that real
people go through.''
</P>
<P>
   Baker said Florio will have to battle suspicions that his new
image is ``packaging over substance.'' And Adler said Florio may
have a hard time convincing major contributors that he can win
again, a potentially towering obstacle given the high cost of
statewide campaigns today.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most big contributors give not for ideological reasons, but to
people they think will be winners,'' he said. ``And it's very hard
to resuscitate a dead politician.''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The federal budget deficit is history, and the
strong economy is generating surpluses that could last for decades.
But in Washington, pledges of budgetary austerity are emanating
from both parties in a way they never did when the outlook was
bleak.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, Republicans are still fixated on a big tax cut, and
Democrats still tend to want to throw money at problems. But both
parties have built their agendas this year around the goals of
reducing the national debt and keeping spending in check.
</P>
<P>
   There are certainly great economic benefits to be gained from
keeping the country's financial house in order and using any
windfall wisely. Still, given that Washington's commitment to
fiscal discipline was notably absent during the 1980s and early
1990s when it was arguably needed most, it seems fair to wonder
whether this bipartisan outbreak of responsibility will prove more
than a passing political fad.
</P>
<P>
   Chances are that by the end of the year Congress and President
Clinton will have broken the strict spending caps at the heart of
the current budget law. As the $20 billion burst of last-minute
spending outside the caps last year proved, it's hard to hold the
line when faced with pleas for aid to hard-pressed farmers, or pay
increases for the military, or more money for Head Start.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, even with the country as flush as it is, there is
little evidence that the two parties will be able to turn their
good intentions into agreements on shoring up the twin pillars of
the social welfare system: Social Security and Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   Implicit in the whole austerity effort, however transitory, is
the broader question of whether it requires a crisis to take tough
action or whether, as Clinton likes to say, the best time to fix
the roof is while the sun is shining.
</P>
<P>
   If political positioning were the standard, the answer would be
clear. For now at least, Democrats and Republicans alike are
determined to portray themselves as not just fiscally pure but
purer than the other party.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton started the bidding by proposing that three-quarters of
projected surpluses be set aside, effectively through debt
reduction, to deal with the looming problems in Social Security and
Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans countered last week with a plan to stop the
longstanding practice by both parties of using Social Security's
reserves to pay for spending and tax cuts. Then, in votes in the
House and Senate Budget Committees, Democrats tried to up the ante
by proposing to bar any tax cuts until the long-range solvency of
both Social Security and Medicare has been assured (the Republicans
defeated the effort).
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Democrats on the Senate Budget Committee voted with
Republicans to reject Clinton's budget proposal because it dipped
into Social Security money for a few years to pay for spending
programs.
</P>
<P>
   Behind much of the maneuvering is an attempt by each party to
define itself for the new politics of prosperity.
</P>
<P>
   Notwithstanding the reality that the deficit exploded on
President Ronald Reagan's watch in the 1980s as they cut taxes,
pumped up the Pentagon budget and did little to restrain domestic
spending, Republicans have long laid claim to being the party of
fiscal responsibility. Having seen the Democrats under Clinton
co-opt them on so many issues, Republicans are eager to reassert
themselves on this one.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we're not recognized as the party that wants to restrain
spending and cut taxes, what's the purpose?'' said Rep. John
Kasich, R-Ohio, chairman of the House Budget Committee.
</P>
<P>
   For Democrats, the situation is more complicated. On one level,
many Democrats, even some liberals, now seem convinced that the
nation cannot afford to spend with abandon, and that keeping the
federal budget under control yields big benefits to working
families by keeping interest rates, inflation and unemployment
down.
</P>
<P>
   But Democrats also believe that using the bulk of anticipated
surpluses in a way that helps Social Security and Medicare works
for them on both political and policy grounds. If they prevail this
year, it will be because Clinton managed to link the idea of debt
repayment to strengthening the two most popular social welfare
programs.
</P>
<P>
   From the Democratic perspective, the argument is simple: A
sweeping tax cut now, before the expected surpluses materialize,
risks squandering the best chance to deal with Social Security and
Medicare while requiring painful and unjustified cuts in a wide
array of popular programs. If they can block Republican tax cuts
and in the process erase the tax-and-spend stigma they have been
stuck with for years, so much the better.
</P>
<P>
   The professed commitment to austerity within both parties
appears to be driven in part by a palpable sense of skepticism
among voters _ evident in polls and in meetings between elected
officials and constituents _ that the promised surpluses will ever
materialize.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Clinton administration and Democrats more generally have
discovered that the best route to achieving liberal ends may be
conservative means, especially when those ends are defined as
preserving the social welfare programs most highly regarded by the
citizenry,'' said Thomas Mann, director of governmental studies at
the Brookings Institution. ``That approach has the great benefit of
matching the priority of the public.''

the current budget law. As the $20 billion burst of last-minute
spending outside the caps last year proved, it's hard to hold the
line when faced with pleas for aid to hard-pressed farmers, or pay
increases for the military, or more money for Head Start.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, even with the country as flush as it is, there is
little evidence that the two parties will be able to turn their
good intentions into agreements on shoring up the twin pillars of
the social welfare system: Social Security and Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   Implicit in the whole austerity effort, however transitory, is
the broader question of whether it requires a crisis to take tough
action or whether, as Clinton likes to say, the best time to fix
the roof is while the sun is shining.
</P>
<P>
   If political positioning were the standard, the answer would be
clear. For now at least, Democrats and Republicans alike are
determined to portray themselves as not just fiscally pure but
purer than the other party.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton started the bidding by proposing that three-quarters of
projected surpluses be set aside, effectively through debt
reduction, to deal with the looming problems in Social Security and
Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans countered last week with a plan to stop the
longstanding practice by both parties of using Social Security's
reserves to pay for spending and tax cuts. Then, in votes in the
House and Senate Budget Committees, Democrats tried to up the ante
by proposing to bar any tax cuts until the long-range solvency of
both Social Security and Medicare has been assured (the Republicans
defeated the effort).
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Democrats on the Senate Budget Committee voted with
Republicans to reject Clinton's budget proposal because it dipped
into Social Security money for a few years to pay for spending
programs.
</P>
<P>
   Behind much of the maneuvering is an attempt by each party to
define itself for the new politics of prosperity.
</P>
<P>
   Notwithstanding the reality that the deficit exploded on
President Ronald Reagan's watch in the 1980s as they cut taxes,
pumped up the Pentagon budget and did little to restrain domestic
spending, Republicans have long laid claim to being the party of
fiscal responsibility. Having seen the Democrats under Clinton
co-opt them on so many issues, Republicans are eager to reassert
themselves on this one.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we're not recognized as the party that wants to restrain
spending and cut taxes, what's the purpose?'' said Rep. John
Kasich, R-Ohio, chairman of the House Budget Committee.
</P>
<P>
   For Democrats, the situation is more complicated. On one level,
many Democrats, even some liberals, now seem convinced that the
nation cannot afford to spend with abandon, and that keeping the
federal budget under control yields big benefits to working
families by keeping interest rates, inflation and unemployment
down.
</P>
<P>
   But Democrats also believe that using the bulk of anticipated
surpluses in a way that helps Social Security and Medicare works
for them on both political and policy grounds. If they prevail this
year, it will be because Clinton managed to link the idea of debt
repayment to strengthening the two most popular social welfare
programs.
</P>
<P>
   From the Democratic perspective, the argument is simple: A
sweeping tax cut now, before the expected surpluses materialize,
risks squandering the best chance to deal with Social Security and
Medicare while requiring painful and unjustified cuts in a wide
array of popular programs. If they can block Republican tax cuts
and in the process erase the tax-and-spend stigma they have been
stuck with for years, so much the better.
</P>
<P>
   The professed commitment to austerity within both parties
appears to be driven in part by a palpable sense of skepticism
among voters _ evident in polls and in meetings between elected
officials and constituents _ that the promised surpluses will ever
materialize.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Clinton administration and Democrats more generally have
discovered that the best route to achieving liberal ends may be
conservative means, especially when those ends are defined as
preserving the social welfare programs most highly regarded by the
citizenry,'' said Thomas Mann, director of governmental studies at
the Brookings Institution. ``That approach has the great benefit of
matching the priority of the public.''

   WEST HOLLYWOOD, Calif. _ It's 11 o'clock on Friday night in a
brightly lighted store on the Sunset Strip. Men and women with
expressions ranging from nonchalance to embarrassment are perusing
the merchandise: saucy lingerie, edible body powders and, behind a
translucent partition bearing the words ``Relax, It's Just Sex,''
hardcore videos and sex toys. Elsewhere, customers are sipping
lattes and looking over shelves of best-selling books, newspapers
and sexually explicit magazines.
</P>
<P>
   This is Hustler Hollywood, a 9,000-square-foot up-market sex
emporium. With its floor-to-ceiling windows and coffee bar, it
unashamedly pitches erotica. Opened last December, it is the
flagship of what its owner, Larry Flynt, hopes will be a nationwide
Hustler chain. Its sleek design, prominently displayed aromatic
candles and Kama Sutra massage oils are intended to appeal to
women.
</P>
<P>
   The name and its raunchy connotations may be a marketing gamble,
but Flynt said he never considered any other. ``Hustler signifies a
certain something to people, and that is rebellion,'' he said.
``People identify with this type of rebellion and associate the
same thing with the store, so it becomes sort of taboo or forbidden
fruit.''
</P>
<P>
   And that forbidden fruit is brazenly marketed, from the vivid
red neon sign outside to Hustler mugs, Larry Flynt T-shirts and
stacks of Flynt's autobiography. When he opened a more conventional
adult store called ``Hustler Magazine Books and Gifts'' in
Cincinnati two years ago, he said, a quarter of the customers were
women.
</P>
<P>
   In designing the West Hollywood store, he wanted to create an
atmosphere different from the typical sex store, he said, ``more
comfortable for women, more like Barnes &AMP; Noble or Neiman Marcus.''
</P>
<P>
   About half the customers on a recent Friday night were women.
``I like the unisex aspect of it all,'' said Caroline Gomez, a
college student. The store was ``really tasteful,'' she said,
``which makes the products look appealing.'' She said she was
attracted to the store because of its controversial owner.
</P>
<P>
   Whether Hustler can become the chain envisioned by Flynt is not
clear. During the course of its day, from 8 a.m. to 2 a.m., the
store fluctuates from bustling to nearly dead. Still, Flynt said he
plans to open stores in Las Vegas and Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, he said, ``I'm really very, very disappointed that I
didn't move into the retail business years ago, because I never
realized the marketing power of the Hustler name and logo.''

   In 1969, the California psychiatrist Dr. David Reuben published
a groundbreaking book with the improbable title ``Everything You
Always Wanted to Know About Sex But Were Afraid to Ask.''
</P>
<P>
   Answering hundreds of blush-inducing questions about the most
basic of human relations (``What does impotence mean?'' ``What
happens during orgasm?''), it was a blockbuster primer for those
confronted by the polymorphous excesses of the Age of Aquarius.
Reuben was touted as ``the new apostle of sanity in sex'' and his
carnal Baedeker became a No. 1 best seller in 51 countries.
</P>
<P>
   Three decades later, we live in a culture of AIDS, Viagra and
presidential oral sex discussed publicly in Congress. So on
Valentine's Day, HarperCollins released an updated edition of
Reuben's magnum opus (hereinafter referred to by its catchy
acronym, EYAWTKAS BWATA). The work is far from 99 44/100 percent
pure, but it is being billed as ``96.9 percent new.''
</P>
<P>
   Some idea of the revisions that Reuben has wrought in his pages,
and in his thinking, can be gleaned even by comparing some of the

expression, military service, sexual harassment and a lot of other
things. ... You may believe that homosexuality is good or you may
believe that it is bad. But as a physician and a scientist, I
cannot pass that kind of personal judgment. Therefore nothing in

<P>
   The most exclusive Oscar party of all will not be held in
Hollywood on Sunday night. It will take place in front of a
television set in the depths of the Louisiana State Penitentiary at
Angola, the largest maximum security prison in the United States
and the setting for ``The Farm,'' which was nominated for best
feature documentary.
</P>
<P>
   The guest of honor will be Wilbert Rideau, a black man convicted
of murdering a white woman 38 years ago, who has edited The
Angolite, the prison's award-winning news magazine, for 25 years.
Rideau co-directed ``The Farm'' with New York filmmakers Liz Garbus
and Jonathan Stack, but he is not named on the nomination because
an Academy Awards rule permits only two names per documentary.
</P>
<P>
   Reporters from around the world have descended on Angola with
more intensity than anyone has seen in a while, many to cover the
incongruity of Oscar night and the life of a 57-year-old trusty.
The execution of Dobie Gillis Williams at the prison in January
attracted some unusual attention, mainly because Williams'
``spiritual adviser'' was Sister Helen Prejean, author of ``Dead
Man Walking''(Random House, 1993), which was made into a movie that
was filmed at Angola.
</P>
<P>
   But Cathy Jett, the prison's executive staff officer in charge
of public information, says there hasn't been this much press
interest since Rideau's book, ``Life Sentences'' (Times Books,
1992), was published. It was this collection of Angolite articles
that first attracted Ms. Garbus and Stack.
</P>
<P>
   Rideau's haunting portraits of life and death at Angola became
the basis for ``The Farm,'' which documents the lives of six
prisoners, one dying, another on death row and four others
rehabilitated but with no hope of release in Louisiana's penal
system, which reflects a national trend toward lengthy
incarceration.
</P>
<P>
   Stack says Angola has always provided ``the kind of material
that makes filmmakers salivate.'' It has the same effect on
journalists. ``The fact is, the Oscars are not that interesting,''
said Edward Hillmore, who visited Angola for The London Evening
Standard. ``But here's a story that has a lot more to it than who's
wearing what designer on Oscar night.''
</P>
<P>
   Angola's pull on journalists and movie people amazes Ms. Jett.
``I went to the opening of `The Farm' in New York,'' she said,
``and at the dinner I sat down at a table with people from Vogue,
and Anne Heche and William Baldwin, you know, and I didn't even get
to eat because people kept asking me about what it's like to work
here and be a woman and the death penalty and oh, my gosh, what
didn't they ask?''
</P>
<P>
   Angola perhaps offers the mystique of exploring what is both
exotic and fearsome _ but, like the revolutionaries with round-trip
tickets in the V.S. Naipaul essay, ``Killings in Trinidad,''
filmmakers and journalists get to go home.
</P>
<P>
   Except, of course, for Rideau. At 19 he shot two bank employees
and stabbed a third, Julia Ferguson, to death during a robbery.
Rideau, whose death sentence was commuted to life when a 1972
Supreme Court ruling overturned capital punishment, has often
expressed remorse for his crime. His quarter-century crusade ``to
make a difference,'' as he puts it, has earned him acclaim but not
freedom.
</P>
<P>
   Of late Rideau has been interviewed by CBS News, the Norwegian
Broadcasting Corp., the German magazine Stern and lawyer Johnnie
Cochran for Court TV, among others. For most of these visitors, the
mystique of the prison has given way to the question of why Rideau
is still there.
</P>
<P>
   In a 1978 Angolite article, Rideau, who refuses to write about
his own case, said that ``long-term prisoners are hostages of fear
and politics, their fate determined by the vagaries of the
political mood.''
</P>
<P>
   Back in the days when Angola was one of the country's most
violent prisons, before rehabilitation became an issue, paroles and
pardons were probably more possible. In the 1930s, Gov. O.K. Allen
released Leadbelly after the future blues legend petitioned him in
song.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Angola is a model prison, proudly running daily tours of
the 5,200-inmate institution, including its state-of-the-art
execution chamber. Yet 88 percent of the convicts will never leave,
according to the state's prisons department, regardless of how
rehabilitated some become.
</P>
<P>
   Rideau's acclaim _ more than his race and that of the victim and
the brutal nature of the crime _ has perhaps increased the prospect
that he will be denied clemency. Two governors have scuttled four
recommendations by the pardon board to release him. And the
lobbying against Rideau from Calcasieu Parish, where he committed
his crime, remains as fervent as ever.
</P>
<P>
   Alexandra Geneste, a correspondent for La Croix, the French
Catholic daily newspaper, came away from her five-and-a-half-hour
interview with Rideau deeply troubled. ``It was so moving to hear
him saying, `Yes, I was a bad person for sure, but look what I've
done and life is not over,''' she said. ``And I think that we as
journalists definitely have to do something for him.''
</P>
<P>
   A front-page article on Rideau by Ennio Caretto in the Italian
newspaper Corriere della Sera described Angola as ``America's
Gulag.'' ``In Italy,'' he said in an interview, ``in a case like
his, he would have already been returned to society.''
</P>
<P>
   The warden, Burl Cain, said in a recent interview: ``If it were
up to me, I think he could go free and go to some other state where
he could pursue his journalism talents. Wilbert Rideau is not going
to kill anybody again, I don't think, or ever rob anybody. He's not
about that anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Cain said he has seen to it that on Sunday night Rideau, the
other inmates and members of the press will have ``a good TV and
refreshments.'' The warden, however, will be at the Oscar
presentations in Hollywood in a newly bought tuxedo.
</P>
<P>
   While winning would be good, Cain said, he feels as if ``we've
won already.'' The film, he said, has shown the public ``what it
needed to see _ the old man dying in prison, the people who I feel
are totally rehabilitated, people the public might think would be
monsters being totally normal, everyday people who had done
horrible things but had worked real hard to change their lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Rideau wholeheartedly agrees. The nomination and press coverage,
which still seem ``unreal'' to him, have brought the film a wider
audience, he said last week in a telephone interview. His voice
betrayed what he felt at the prospect of watching from so far away.
``I never expected to go,'' he said. ``It would be nice, however,
if somebody would mention my name up there if we win.''

 By JENNIFER STEINHAUER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The last time you pulled a shirt out of a drawer, it is possible
you were not simply getting dressed. You were actually living out a
small moment of a lifestyle, one shared with thousands of others,
and one you probably didn't know you were leading.
</P>
<P>
   More and more, retailers and makers of products from T-shirts to
watering cans are broadening their pitch, selling their wares by
marketing an entire way of living.
</P>
<P>
   Calvin Klein isn't content to have its customers wear its
underwear; the company longs to have them serve food on its dishes
and towel off with its bath sheets. Starbucks executives don't want
people to just drink their coffee in the morning; they want them to
eat their ice cream and listen to their music CDs in bed. That way,
Starbucks becomes more than a network of caffeine-delivery outlets
_ it elbows its way into consumers' lives and becomes an essential
part of their day.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coffee is a very emotional and romantic beverage,'' said
Howard Schultz, Starbuck's chief executive and lifestyle marketing
evangelist. ``It is an extension of people's front porch. Our
stores are a place where people are very comfortable, because
people trust us. Starbucks is more than a coffee. It is a feeling,
it is an experience.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps this sounds like hokum. But tell that to Levi Strauss &AMP;
Co., one of the most famous brands in America, which announced
recently that declining sales and tough competition would result in
the dismissal of 5,900 workers and the closing of 11 plants. Maybe
one of Levi's problems is that it has no cola. It has no
denim-toned house paint. Levi makes what is essentially a
commodity: blue jeans. Its ads may evoke rugged outdoorsmanship,
but Levi hasn't promoted any particular lifestyle to sell other
products.
</P>
<P>
   Once people get to know a brand's most famous product, the
thinking goes, they will trust that brand to deliver any number of
items, even if the original product has no relationship to the
subsequent stuff the company hawks. To wit: Brooks Brothers now has
its own line of wines and Jack Daniel's sells clothes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Great marketers say the brand can be the thing that holds
their group of consumers together,'' said Sam Hill, a principal
partner at Helios Consulting in New York. ``The lifestyle label is
an intelligent reaction by marketers who want a deeper relationship
with consumers.''
</P>
<P>
   The retail industry generates $2.7 trillion in annual sales, so
those deeper relationships are worth a great deal. There are two
basic steps in lifestyle branding. The first is to plaster the
brand's name or logo on every imaginable product. Ralph Lauren is
not just a polo pony stitched to the front of shirts and dresses;
it's a name that appears on linens, towels, eyeglasses, bras and
house paint. Gucci sells home decor items that resemble their belt
buckles, and nearly every clothing designer has at least one
perfume.
</P>
<P>
   Retailers must also spend a lot of money to create
advertisements that depict their products among people and in
situations that embody what their marketing whizzes call a ``state
of mind'' _ preferably one that appeals to consumers of all ages.
This will ensure that young girls will want to wear your
inappropriately low-cut shirts, because they are older at heart,
and those a bit long-in-the-tooth will buy your wedge-cut sandals,
reasoning that they share a youthful outlook.
</P>
<P>
   The best way for retailers to get lots of people living a
lifestyle is to reach them through a variety of media. Martha
Stewart _ who may actually be the first human to embody a lifestyle
_ has this down pat. She has a weekly television program, a
magazine and several lines of products _ pricey ones sold through
her catalog and magazine, and a set of household items at much
lower prices sold through Kmart stores. The genius of Ms. Stewart's
strategy is that her lifestyle is decidedly upscale, even as she
makes it accessible to middle-class consumers, the nation's biggest
group of purchasers.
</P>
<P>
   To promote a lifestyle, a company must obsessively market its
products through ad campaigns in which the product is not nearly as
central as the people using it. Who cares what jeans the models are
wearing in a Ralph Lauren ad? All that matters is that everyone
looks wholesome, athletic and delighted to be frolicking or
lounging on the grounds of an expensive beach-front property.
</P>
<P>
   In most Nine West ads, it is hard to make out the shoes or bag
for sale. But the women are young and sexy and never far from a
great-looking guy and a romantic setting. A shopper is meant to
believe that if she buys the whole package _ clothes, tables,
sheets and bras _ she will join the elite club of those living out
the brand's lifestyle in its ads.

   ``What people feel about themselves is a much greater predictor
of buying behavior'' than who they actually are, Hill said. ``And
that is really what you care about.''
</P>
<P>
   Stacy Lastrina, a spokeswoman for Nine West, which has expanded
from footwear to handbags, sunglasses and belts, said: ``We
position Nine West as aspirational yet attainable. The one
carry-through is that the wearer has a contemporary, modern, upbeat
attitude.''
</P>
<P>
   Every marketer fantasizes that it knows its customers
intimately. But they are often not quite on the mark. Jill Virkus,
31, a production manager for a publishing company in Chicago, owns
several pairs of Nine West shoes and a purse. Her motive for buying
Nine West seems fairly straightforward. ``I think that their stuff
is wearable and cool looking without being too out there,'' she
said. ``Am I contemporary? Yes. Am I upbeat? Sure. Am I modern? I'm
not sure. That to me is black leather and chrome.''
</P>
<P>
   Ralph Lauren is among the most experienced and relentless
retailers pursuing lifestyle marketing. The company's clothing
ranges from the very high end to T-shirts and jeans, and it sells
sunglasses, house paint, home furnishings, shoes and many other
products.
</P>
<P>
   Lauren says he knows whom he's designing his wares for. ``I know
where they live, where they want to go,'' he said. ``I know how
they dress and the kind of restaurants they go to.''
</P>
<P>
   His vision, he acknowledges, is somewhat flexible: ``A guy who
works on Wall Street may go to the Cape as opposed to the Hamptons,
but the Hollywood guys go to the Hamptons. The photographers go to
Martha's Vineyard.''
</P>
<P>
   By and large, the Ralph Lauren shopper is ``sophisticated and
has his choice of things to buy,'' said Lauren. ``My brand is about
consistency of style and taste, not formula.''
</P>
<P>
   Camille Walker, 27, a nursing assistant in Philadelphia, said
half of her clothes have a Polo label. She also owns sheet sets and
bath mats.
</P>
<P>
   Here is her take on Lauren's vision: ``He advertises to the rich
because he is rich. But mostly poor people wear the sportswear. All
my friends wear the T-shirts and the pants; I am the only one who
wears the designer clothes. Rich people wear his higher-end line,
but Polo is for kids from the ghetto. I don't think he knows that,
but I know that.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't say I live his lifestyle,'' she added. ``I would
say I just thank God for my health.''

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The last time you pulled a shirt out of a drawer, it is possible
you were not simply getting dressed. You were actually living out a
small moment of a lifestyle, one shared with thousands of others,
and one you probably didn't know you were leading.
</P>
<P>
   More and more, retailers and makers of products from T-shirts to
watering cans are broadening their pitch, selling their wares by
marketing an entire way of living.
</P>
<P>
   Calvin Klein isn't content to have its customers wear its
underwear; the company longs to have them serve food on its dishes
and towel off with its bath sheets. Starbucks executives don't want
people to just drink their coffee in the morning; they want them to
eat their ice cream and listen to their music CDs in bed. That way,
Starbucks becomes more than a network of caffeine-delivery outlets
_ it elbows its way into consumers' lives and becomes an essential
part of their day.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coffee is a very emotional and romantic beverage,'' said
Howard Schultz, Starbuck's chief executive and lifestyle marketing
evangelist. ``It is an extension of people's front porch. Our
stores are a place where people are very comfortable, because
people trust us. Starbucks is more than a coffee. It is a feeling,
it is an experience.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps this sounds like hokum. But tell that to Levi Strauss &AMP;
Co., one of the most famous brands in America, which announced
recently that declining sales and tough competition would result in
the dismissal of 5,900 workers and the closing of 11 plants. Maybe
one of Levi's problems is that it has no cola. It has no
denim-toned house paint. Levi makes what is essentially a
commodity: blue jeans. Its ads may evoke rugged outdoorsmanship,
but Levi hasn't promoted any particular lifestyle to sell other
products.
</P>
<P>
   Once people get to know a brand's most famous product, the
thinking goes, they will trust that brand to deliver any number of
items, even if the original product has no relationship to the
subsequent stuff the company hawks. To wit: Brooks Brothers now has
its own line of wines and Jack Daniel's sells clothes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Great marketers say the brand can be the thing that holds
their group of consumers together,'' said Sam Hill, a principal
partner at Helios Consulting in New York. ``The lifestyle label is
an intelligent reaction by marketers who want a deeper relationship
with consumers.''
</P>
<P>
   The retail industry generates $2.7 trillion in annual sales, so
those deeper relationships are worth a great deal. There are two
basic steps in lifestyle branding. The first is to plaster the
brand's name or logo on every imaginable product. Ralph Lauren is
not just a polo pony stitched to the front of shirts and dresses;
it's a name that appears on linens, towels, eyeglasses, bras and
house paint. Gucci sells home decor items that resemble their belt
buckles, and nearly every clothing designer has at least one
perfume.
</P>
<P>
   Retailers must also spend a lot of money to create
advertisements that depict their products among people and in
situations that embody what their marketing whizzes call a ``state
of mind'' _ preferably one that appeals to consumers of all ages.
This will ensure that young girls will want to wear your
inappropriately low-cut shirts, because they are older at heart,
and those a bit long-in-the-tooth will buy your wedge-cut sandals,
reasoning that they share a youthful outlook.
</P>
<P>
   The best way for retailers to get lots of people living a
lifestyle is to reach them through a variety of media. Martha
Stewart _ who may actually be the first human to embody a lifestyle
_ has this down pat. She has a weekly television program, a
magazine and several lines of products _ pricey ones sold through
her catalog and magazine, and a set of household items at much
lower prices sold through Kmart stores. The genius of Ms. Stewart's
strategy is that her lifestyle is decidedly upscale, even as she
makes it accessible to middle-class consumers, the nation's biggest
group of purchasers.
</P>
<P>
   To promote a lifestyle, a company must obsessively market its
products through ad campaigns in which the product is not nearly as
central as the people using it. Who cares what jeans the models are
wearing in a Ralph Lauren ad? All that matters is that everyone
looks wholesome, athletic and delighted to be frolicking or
lounging on the grounds of an expensive beach-front property.
</P>
<P>
   In most Nine West ads, it is hard to make out the shoes or bag
for sale. But the women are young and sexy and never far from a
great-looking guy and a romantic setting. A shopper is meant to
believe that if she buys the whole package _ clothes, tables,
sheets and bras _ she will join the elite club of those living out
the brand's lifestyle in its ads.
</P>
<P>
   ``What people feel about themselves is a much greater predictor
of buying behavior'' than who they actually are, Hill said. ``And
that is really what you care about.''
</P>
<P>
   Stacy Lastrina, a spokeswoman for Nine West, which has expanded

carry-through is that the wearer has a contemporary, modern, upbeat
attitude.''

   WASHINGTON _ Investigators at the international war crimes
tribunal in The Hague, Netherlands, have concluded that the
Croatian army carried out summary executions, indiscriminate
shelling of civilian populations and ``ethnic cleansing'' during a
1995 assault that was a turning point in the Balkan wars, according
to tribunal documents.
</P>
<P>
   The investigators have recommended that three Croatian generals
be indicted, and a U.S. official said last week that the
indictments could come within a few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The indictments would be the first of Croatian army officers for
actions in the Balkan wars of 1991 to 1995, which first pitted an
independence-seeking Croatia against rebel Serbs and Serbia proper,
and then moved to Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   Any indictment of Croatian army generals could prove politically
troublesome for the Clinton administration, which has a delicate
relationship with Croatia, a U.S. ally with a poor human rights
record in preserving the peace in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   The August 1995 Croatian offensive, which drove some 100,000
Serbs from a large swath of Croatia over four days, was carried out
with the tacit blessing of the United States by a Croatian army
that had been schooled in part by a group of retired U.S. military
officers. Questions remain about the full extent of U.S.
involvement.
</P>
<P>
   In the course of the three-year investigation into the assault,
the United States has failed to provide critical evidence requested
by the tribunal, according to tribunal documents and officials,
adding to suspicion among some there that Washington is uneasy
about the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Two senior Canadian military officers, for example, who were in
Croatia during the offensive, testified that the assault, which saw
some 3,000 shells rain down on the city of Knin over 48 hours, was
indiscriminate and targeted civilians.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon, however, has argued through U.S. lawyers at the
tribunal that the shelling was a legitimate military activity,
according to tribunal documents and officials. And U.S. officials
have repeatedly maintained that they have provided full cooperation
with the tribunal.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the Croatian Ministry of Defense denied that any
war crimes or other illegal acts were committed during the
offensive, which the Croatians dubbed Operation Storm.
</P>
<P>
   To date, the war crimes tribunal, set up by the United Nations
in 1993, has indicted 83 people, most of them Serbs. Its chief
prosecutor, Louise Arbour, will ultimately decide whether the
indictments should be issued.
</P>
<P>
   The investigators have also recently begun looking into whether
the Croatian president, Franjo Tudjman, should be held responsible
under international law for his role in the assault, tribunal and
U.S. officials said.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the investigators have stepped up an inquiry
focusing on Slobodan Milosevic, the Yugoslav leader, who is widely
seen as the architect of the Balkan wars. U.S. officials and
tribunal staff said that a special team to investigate Milosevic
was set up at the tribunal in October.
</P>
<P>
   That the tribunal only recently began looking closely at
Milosevic contradicts the widespread speculation that he has
already been secretly indicted.
</P>
<P>
   Tribunal officials rejected reports that the tribunal had
refrained from indicting Milosevic because of pressure from the
United States, which sees the Yugoslav leader as a guarantor of the
Dayton accords.
</P>
<P>
   To assist the tribunal, the Clinton administration has set up a
task force to cull through reams of photos, telephone intercepts
and other material held by various government agencies, including
the CIA and the Pentagon, U.S. officials said last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was never any political pressure'' against indicting
Milosevic, said William Stuebner, an American who served as an
adviser to the tribunal's chief prosecutor from 1994 to 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Stuebner would not talk about any investigation, and the
tribunal officials who did so spoke on condition of anonymity. An
American lawyer who has been at the tribunal said that talking
about the investigations was like revealing grand jury
deliberations and that anyone who did so would be dismissed.
</P>
<P>
   The tribunal has begun an internal investigation to determine
who provided The New York Times with a copy of the report on
Operation Storm, two former tribunal officials said last week.
</P>
<P>
   Operation Storm was a stunning military assault. In just four
days, the Croatian army regained territory that had been held by
rebel Serbs for four years. The Croatian army then linked up with
Bosnian Croat forces and began to roll over Serbian units in
neighboring Bosnia. Those defeats, along with the NATO bombing,
helped bring the Serbs to the negotiating table in Dayton.
</P>
<P>
   But there was a darker side to Operation Storm, one largely
overlooked in the West, which had little sympathy for the Serbs.
The Croatian army drove more than 100,000 Serbs from their
ancestral homelands, forcing them to flee on carts and in small
cars jammed with their possessions. In terms of sheer numbers, it
was the largest ``ethnic cleansing'' of the war, though it was not
as brutal as the worst of Serb treatment of Bosnian Muslims during
the war.
</P>
<P>
   A section of the tribunal's 150-page report is headed: ``The
Indictment. Operation Storm, A Prima Facie Case.''
</P>
<P>
   ``During the course of the military offensive, the Croatian
armed forces and special police committed numerous violations of
international humanitarian law, including but not limited to,
shelling of Knin and other cities,'' the report says. ``During, and
in the 100 days following the military offensive, at least 150 Serb
civilians were summarily executed, and many hundreds disappeared.''
The crimes also included looting and burning, the report says.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a widespread and systematic manner, Croatian troops
committed murder and other inhumane acts upon and against Croatian
Serbs,'' the investigators say at another point in the report.
</P>
<P>
   The report says investigators gathered ``sufficient material to
establish that the three generals who commanded the military
operation'' _ Mirko Norac, Ante Gotovina, and the military governor
of the Knin region, Ivan Cermak _ could be held accountable under
international law.
</P>
<P>
   These men, the report charges, were responsible for driving the
Serbs out of the area, a process that became known as ``ethnic
cleansing'' as leaders of different ethnic groups in the countries
that were previously part of Yugoslavia sought to create ethnically
pure territories.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   The most contentious recommendation of the investigators related
to the shelling of Knin.
</P>
<P>
   Two senior Canadian military officers, Gen. Alain Forand and
Col. Andrew Leslie, who were with the U.N. peacekeeping forces in
Knin at the time, were unequivocal in their testimony to the
tribunal that the shelling had been indiscriminate and did not
serve a legitimate military function. ``Why they shelled Knin is
still hard to believe,'' Forand told the investigators. ``There is
no doubt in my mind that the Croats knew they were shelling
civilian targets.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the 3,000 shells fired into Knin, fewer than 250 hit military
targets, Leslie testified.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is either bloody poor shooting,'' Leslie said, according
to the tribunal report, ``or one must logically assume that the
fire was deliberately directed against civilian buildings.''
</P>
<P>
   Last August, during a meeting to review the investigators' work
and recommendations, a senior legal officer at the tribunal,
William Fenrick, described the Canadian officers as ``about as good
as we will ever get as far as eyewitnesses to a shelling,''
according to the tribunal report.
</P>
<P>
   But the report goes on to quote an American lawyer at the
tribunal, Clint Williamson, as seeking to discredit the Canadian
officers' testimony. They were ``not capable of detached
analysis,'' he said, according to the investigation report.
</P>
<P>
   Williamson, who described the shelling of Knin as a ``minor
incident,'' said that the Pentagon had told him that Knin was a
legitimate military target.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Fenrick is then quoted as telling the August meeting
that he was inclined to include the Knin shelling in an indictment.
</P>
<P>
   Then the review panel broke for lunch. When they returned,
Fenrick had changed his mind. ``I am switching from the Canadian
general who watched, to the American general who probably planned
the operation,'' he said, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
   The review concluded by voting not to include the shelling of
Knin in any indictment, a conclusion that stunned and angered many
at the tribunal. On the other charges, which were less contentious,
the review panel recommended further investigation. In January, a
tribunal team went back to Croatia.
</P>
<P>
   The identity of the ``American general'' referred to by Fenrick
is not known. The tribunal would not allow Williamson or Fenrick to
be interviewed. But Ms. Arbour, the tribunal's chief prosecutor,
suggested in a telephone interview last week that Fenrick's comment
had been ``a joking observation.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Arbour had not been present during the meeting, and that is
not how it was viewed by some who were there.
</P>
<P>
   Several people who were at the meeting assumed that Fenrick was
referring to one of the retired U.S. generals who worked for
Military Professional Resources Inc., a private, Virginia-based
training company staffed by retired U.S. military officers whose
presence in Croatia was no secret, even though exactly what it was
doing remains a matter of intense intrigue.
</P>
<P>
   Noting that it has been widely speculated among European
military analysts and diplomats that the Croats had outside help in
planning their 1995 offensive, the company has insisted that its
role in Croatia was limited to classroom instruction on
military-civil relations.
</P>
<P>
   The vote against including the shelling of Knin in any eventual
indictment has stoked the belief among many at the tribunal that
the United States was trying to manipulate the judicial body. Ms.
Arbour and U.S. officials strenuously deny this.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Arbour said she would welcome the Pentagon's views on a
military matter if it would help the tribunal prepare a case before
going into court.
</P>
<P>
   But there is evidence that the United States has not been as
helpful as it might be with the Operation Storm investigation.
</P>
<P>
   In May 1996, for example, the investigators asked the United
States for eight satellite photos taken of specific grids in the
Krajina region of Croatia, where the operation took place, on
specific days during Operation Storm.
</P>
<P>
   The grids related to the shelling of Knin, the location of Serb
troops _ which might help determine whether it was a legitimate
military target _ as well as the burning and looting of villages
and possible bombing of refugee columns by the Croatian air force.
</P>
<P>
   The team got no response, tribunal officials said. Ms. Arbour
said that she could not comment on specific requests to
governments. She also declined to say anything about the status of
the investigation.

<P>
   MISSILE-DEFENSE-REVIEW (Washington) _ The nation is fast moving
toward developing a national missile defense. When viewed as a
domestic political issue, it seems surprising that the former
divisiveness over the question seems to be suddenly, magically
melting away. But don't be fooled. As an international political
and diplomatic issue, the surprise is that it's more contentious
than ever. By Eric Schmitt. (`i' category)
</P>
<P>
   ECON-JITTERS-REVIEW (Undated) _ The Dow floats near 10,000. Jobs
are plentiful. Wages are rising. Spending is everywhere. The
economy booms, month after month. And nothing seems to shake the
public sense of prosperity. So why are the oracles of the economy
talking like Nervous Nellies? Because this is not only the biggest
economic expansion in history but also the most atypical. By Louis
Uchitelle. (`a' category). WITH GRAPHIC.

   _ Also moving in the `a' category:
</P>
<P>
   SMALL-ISSUES-REVIEW (Washington) _ If Bill Clinton shrunk the
presidency from a wellspring of grand ideas to a trickle of
itsy-bitsy proposals, then Al Gore, Elizabeth Dole and other
would-be successors are going further by addressing seemingly
unpresidential issues like traffic congestion and lights in
airplane passenger aisles. These appeals to everyday life may
reflect a radical change in what people expect from a president.
Talking about small issues may be a way of avoiding larger ones
that are more difficult, perhaps impossible, to deal with. By
Richard L. Berke.
</P>
<P>
   POLITICAL-HANGERS-ON-REVIEW (Washington) _ Former New Jersey
Gov. Jim Florio wants to run for the Senate. Former Rep. Bob Dornan
of California and former Sen. Alfonse D'Amato of New York signal
that they may want to run again for their old jobs. Like ghosts of
elections past, defeated politicians trying to reclaim old glory
demand attention from voters and the media. But the people they
often end up scaring the most are members of their own parties. By
James Dao. WITH PHOTO.
</P>
<P>
   BUDGET-AUSTERITY-REVIEW (Washington) _ Pledges of budgetary
austerity are emanating from both parties in a way they never did
when the outlook was bleak. Given that Washington's commitment to
fiscal discipline was notably absent during the 1980s and early
1990s when it was needed most, it seems fair to wonder whether this
bipartisan outbreak of responsibility will prove more than a
passing political fad. By Richard W. Stevenson.
</P>
<P>
   PORN-PALACE-REVIEW (West Hollywood, Calif.) _ Hustler Hollywood
is a 9,000-square-foot up-market sex emporium. With its
floor-to-ceiling windows and coffee bar, it unashamedly pitches
erotica. Opened last December, its sleek design, aromatic candles
and Kama Sutra massage oils are intended to appeal to women. It is
the flagship of what owner Larry Flynt hopes will be a nationwide
Hustler chain. By Frances Anderton. WITH PHOTO.
</P>
<P>
   SEX-MANUAL-TEXT-REVIEW (Undated) _ In 1969, Dr. David Reuben
published the groundbreaking book `Everything You Always Wanted to
Know About Sex But Were Afraid to Ask.' Now, 30 years later, comes
an updated edition. An idea of the revisions can be gleaned by
comparing some of the tamer passages of his book's two editions.
</P>
<P>
   OSCAR-PRISON-REVIEW (Undated) _ The most exclusive Oscar party
of all will take place in the Louisiana State Penitentiary at
Angola, the setting for `The Farm,' which was nominated for best
feature documentary. The guest of honor will be Wilbert Rideau,
convicted of murder 38 years ago, who co-directed `The Farm' with
New York filmmakers Liz Garbus and Jonathan Stack. He is not named
on the nomination because an Academy Awards rule permits only two
names per documentary. By Elin Schoen Brockman.
</P>
<P>
   BRAND-DIVERSIFICATION-REVIEW (Undated) _ Retailers and makers of
products from T-shirts to watering cans are broadening their pitch,
selling their wares by marketing an entire way of living. Once
people get to know a brand's most famous product, the thinking
goes, they will trust that brand to deliver any number of items,
even if the original product has no relationship to the subsequent
stuff the company markets. By Jennifer Steinhauer.
</P>
<P>
   COMPUTER-SNAFU-REVIEW (Undated) _ In a form letter from Arizona
State University, a prospective student's Social Security number
was inadvertently substituted for his name. The university says
only a handful of such faulty letters were mailed _ out of
thousands sent out recently by the college's parents association _
and the glitch has been corrected. WITH PHOTO.

   THISWEEK-REVIEW (Undated) _ Some highlights of the week.
</P>
<P>
   _ Also moving in the `i' category:
</P>
<P>
   SADDAM-MILOSEVIC-REVIEW (Undated) _ Iraq's Saddam Hussein and
Serbia's Slobodan Milosevic are similar in that both have become
experts at cornering the world's only superpower, frustrating its
diplomatic strategists, tying down its military and daring the
United States to use force to get its way. Each has laid bare the
lack of a Western strategy to deal with dictators who, simply by
continuing in power, further weaken the ability of their peoples to
resist. By Alison Smale.
</P>
<P>
   LATAM-TAXES-REVIEW (Quito, Ecuador) _ With governments all over
Latin America coming under pressure from the IMF and other lenders
to cut yawning budget deficits, there is a growing recognition that
the region's historical and deeply ingrained aversion to paying
taxes is crippling development and poisoning citizens' attitudes
about their societies and governments. By Larry Rohter.

Saturday when their Breitling Orbiter 3 completed the first nonstop
balloon trip around the world _ a goal many had sought but never
achieved.
</P>
<P>
   At 4:54 a.m. EST, at an altitude of 36,000 feet, the balloon
sped past the finish line at longitude 9 degrees 27 minutes west in
Mauritania, the longitude from which they began their 20-day
voyage. The harrowing trip had taken the pilots over Europe,
Africa, Asia, the Pacific Ocean, Central America and the Atlantic
Ocean.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking by satellite telephone to the balloon's ground crew
here, Piccard said he felt that an ``invisible hand'' had guided
the balloon.
</P>
<P>
   After flying over the equally invisible finish point, the
Breitling pilots decided to continue on for another day at high
speed, intending to land in Egypt on Sunday morning.
</P>
<P>
   When the pilots crossed the finish line, their mission control
team at Geneva airport broke into cheers and sprayed a forest of
news television cameras with champagne.
</P>
<P>
   (After the balloon took off on March 1 from Chateau-d`Oex in the
Swiss Alps, the pilots initially flew southwest to North Africa to
catch a favorable jet stream going eastward. The official beginning
of their trip was therefore the westernmost point the balloon
reached before heading east).
</P>
<P>
   Before reaching Egypt, the balloon is expected to fly over
Libya, a nation that has sometimes barred balloonists from its
airspace.
</P>
<P>
   ``But for us, Libya has been extremely helpful and
cooperative,'' said Alan Noble, an English balloonist and engineer
who was the team's flight director. He said the Breitling Orbiter
3's lifting gas would cool Saturday night and the balloon would be
allowed to descend slowly to the ground on Sunday morning, provided
all continues to go well.
</P>
<P>
   A team is waiting to pick up the two aeronauts. With more than
one day's supply of propane fuel still aboard, the balloonists said
they would try to reach the Nile desert before landing just after
dawn on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   They had hoped to set down near the Pyramids in Cairo, but the
winds will take them too far south, their meteorologists said.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, the Swiss Post Office announced Saturday that on
Wednesday it would issue a commemorative stamp honoring the
balloon.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from establishing the greatest record in ballooning
history, the Breitling's crew has met the requirement by which they
will receive $1 million from the Anheuser-Busch brewing company, as
well as the Budweiser Cup, offered to the first balloonist to
circumnavigate the earth without landing.
</P>
<P>
   Asked by the ground crew whether they were celebrating their
achievement as they flew over Mauritania, Jones replied, ``The
first thing I'll do is phone my wife, and then, like the good
Englishman I am, I'll have a cup of tea.''
</P>
<P>
   Piccard, a medical doctor and psychiatrist, said that it would
be sad to part with the balloon, which will never be used again,
and that the entire Breitling crew would now have to adjust to a
change in lifestyle. He thanked Breitling, a Swiss manufacturer of
watches, for its support over the last five years, which included
three attempts to circle the world.
</P>
<P>
   The precise cost of long-duration balloons is never publicly
announced, but the Breitling Orbiter 3, built by Cameron Balloons
Ltd. of Bristol, England, is known to have cost about $2 million _
a sum that did not include salaries for a 13-member ground staff
and many other expenses.
</P>
<P>
   In the grip of a powerful jet stream, the balloon was traveling
at about 130 mph Saturday when it passed high over the finishing
point.
</P>
<P>
   Noble said that Egyptian helicopters were prepared to pick up
Piccard and Jones and that their gondola might be retrieved by
truck.
</P>
<P>
   Normally, the balloon carrying the gondola is ripped apart when
the craft lands, and it is expected that nothing will be left of
the Breitling Orbiter 3 but the gondola that housed the crew for 20
long days.
</P>
<P>
   The flight of the Breitling Orbiter 3 was a triumph of piloting
skill, helped by steady improvements in balloon technology over the
years and superb meteorological forecasting. Without this, the
balloon could not have threaded its way around storms, mountain
peaks, hostile airspace, unruly winds, stagnant air and other
hazards.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was like a jigsaw puzzle,'' Noble said, ``and finally we
managed to pull it all together.''
</P>
<P>
   The danger of drifting over unfriendly territory is no idle
hazard. Balloonists were stunned in 1995 when two Americans taking
part in the James Gordon Bennett annual balloon race drifted from
Poland into Belarus, where they were shot down and killed by a
Belarusian helicopter.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, long-duration balloonists have tried hard to get
overflight permission from all countries over which they might fly,
but have not always succeeded.
</P>
<P>
   China and Russia have been reluctant to admit balloonists. The
Breitling team was permitted into Chinese airspace this time, but
only on condition that their craft remain south of the 26th
parallel. It sometimes drifted to within 20 miles of this invisible
boundary, eliciting warnings from Chinese radar controllers.
</P>
<P>
   Since they have no power of their own, balloons are at the mercy
of whatever winds they encounter. High-altitude jet-stream winds
flow at speeds up to 200 mph in a generally west-to-east track
around the world. But jet streams may halt or divide into branches
without warning, sometimes carrying a balloon far off course.
</P>
<P>
   However, there are many low-speed wind circulation patterns at
lower altitudes, and by maneuvering between altitudes, skillful
balloonists aided by competent meteorology of ground teams can
generally find a wind going their way.
</P>
<P>
   This allows a balloon to change lanes, so to speak, picking a
direction that avoids hazards and leads into an appropriate jet
stream. Advanced computer modeling of the earth's hour-to-hour wind
patterns, coupled with observations by satellites, commercial
airliners, ships and other sources, allows ground-based
meteorologists to guide balloonists with great accuracy.

 GENEVA: great accuracy.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The development of the global positioning satellite system
permits precise and continuous measurement of a balloon's position
and altitude and satellite communications allow ground controllers
to track a balloon continuously and calculate its best altitude.
</P>
<P>
   Many modern balloons are equipped with autopilots, allowing
their crews to sleep. An autopilot monitors a balloon's altitude,
automatically firing the craft's hot-air burners as needed to
maintain the constant height. But this is only for periods when
course changes are not needed, and most pilots are awake most of
the time.
</P>
<P>
   Piccard said he frequently had trouble getting to sleep during
the three-week flight, and at one point used auto-hypnosis to doze
off. He had learned the technique as part of his medical practice.
</P>
<P>
   The triumph of the Breitling Orbiter 3 culminated a competition
between rival balloon teams that became fiercer each year.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Newman, Richard Branson, Per Lindstrand, Steve Fossett,
Maxie Anderson and many other world-class balloonists have all
tried for the great prize of circling the globe _ and all have
failed.
</P>
<P>
   After his third failed attempt in 1982, Anderson remarked that
it was time to leave further attempts to a new generation of
balloonists.
</P>
<P>
   The Piccard team is the new generation.
</P>
<P>
   During the 1990s, many balloon teams vied to be first around the
world, and their craft became ever more complex and costly.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the recent competitors have bought their rigs from
Cameron Balloons, whose British owner, Don Cameron, is himself a
champion balloonist. His major competitor, Per Lindstrand, a
Swedish balloon maker whose plant is in Wales, built only one of
this year's major balloon in the round-the-world competition _ the
ICO Global Challenge, piloted by Branson, Lindstrand and Fossett.
The ICO balloon, which started in Morocco, ran out of fuel and
ditched near Hawaii last Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   The top contenders during the past year included Fossett, a
wealthy American commodities broker with an urge to excel in many
sports: yachting, mountain climbing, swimming, dog-sled racing and
ballooning.
</P>
<P>
   He has generally preferred competing solo, rather than as a team
member, and all but the most recent of his balloon flights were
made alone.
</P>
<P>
   By flying alone in an unpressurized gondola, lacking almost all
amenities, Fossett attracted a large following of admirers. But on
his solo attempt last year, when he tried to avoid Northern
Hemisphere countries hostile to balloonists, he flew over the
Southern Hemisphere and was forced down in a storm at sea in which
he was nearly killed.
</P>
<P>
   After that, Branson, the billionaire chairman of the group of
companies that includes Virgin Atlantic Airways, invited him as a
crew member of his own balloon. That flight ended in the Pacific
last Dec. 25.
</P>
<P>
   Other competitors in the last year, some of which failed even to
get into the air, were the British Cable &AMP; Wireless balloon (which
set an endurance record now eclipsed by the Breitling balloon), the
Spirit of Peace, the World Quest, the RE/Max Explorer (a huge
balloon that would have been kept aloft on helium alone) and the J.
Rene flown by another solo balloonist, Kevin Uliassi.
</P>
<P>
   In the wings, but unable to finish their balloon projects for
lack of money, were Julian Nott, a champion British balloonist, and
Henk Brink, a Dutch balloonist and helicopter pilot.
</P>
<P>
   Now that a round-the-world flight has succeeded, the competition
has ended, and few balloonists are likely to try for a lesser goal.
Nevertheless, members of the International Aeronautical Federation
have expressed hopes of organizing round-the-world balloon races.
</P>
<P>
   Fellow balloonists were jubilant about the Breitling's success.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was an enormous cheer when we heard that they had
crossed the line,'' said Cameron, whose company built the
history-making balloon. ``There is a certain amount of champagne
being drunk here.''
</P>
<P>
   Branson, who made four failed attempts to circle the globe, told
SKY television in London, ``It is a magnificent achievement, and
two delightful people have achieved it.''
</P>
<P>
   Fossett also saluted the Breitling Orbiter team _ with a hint of
regret.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're a competitor you run the risk of not winning, but
I'm very happy for Piccard and Jones,'' he told The Associated
Press. ``I think it's one of the greatest achievements in aviation.
Even though it was the first form of flight, it's the last type of
aircraft to fly around the world. And there's a great romance to
making a first around the world of any type.''
</P>
<P>
   President Ruth Dreifuss of Switzerland also congratulated the
team. In a telegram addressed to Piccard, she noted that he was
successful on his third attempt to go around the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``This time you won your bet, and the world is your witness,''
she said. ``It is a success for technology, but also the
realization of a a dream that many children _ and adults _ have
you.''

   Marijuana Finds Its Niche
</P>
<P>
   It has been smoked for centuries, lionized in poetry and song
(``Everybody must get stoned!''), vilified in film (``Reefer
Madness''). Now marijuana, which can bring both euphoria and a
federal prison term, has secured its place in the medical
literature, with a comprehensive government-financed report that
finds its active components help patients with pain, nausea and the
severe weight loss associated with AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   The report, conducted by an independent panel of experts at the
Institute of Medicine, set off much hullabaloo when it was
released. Gen. Barry McCaffrey, who commissioned the study as
director of the National Office on Drug Control Policy, trumpeted
its conclusion: There is ``little future in smoked marijuana.''
Proponents of legalizing the drug for medical use seized upon the
report as evidence that ``therapeutic cannabis'' is not a
contradiction in terms.
</P>
<P>
   Both were correct. The 250-page report found that the benefits
of smoking marijuana are limited because of the toxic effects of
the smoke, and urged that new delivery mechanisms, particularly
bronchial inhalers of the sort used by asthma patients, be
developed. At the same time, it recommended that the drug be given,
under close supervision and for a limited time, to patients who do
not respond to other therapies.
</P>
<P>
   The conclusion that caused the biggest stir, however, had more
to do with policy than medicine. The authors found no evidence that
giving marijuana to sick people would increase illicit use
elsewhere in the population. Nor, they said, is marijuana a
``gateway drug'' to more dangerous narcotics like cocaine and
heroin. McCaffrey said the next step is more research.

   A Money Titan's Obscurantism
</P>
<P>
   Last August, the first time Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co. prepared to go
public, it honored a tradition that dates from its founding as a
private partnership 130 years ago: obsessive secrecy. Now Goldman
has augmented its prospectus with 1,400 pages filed last week with
the Securities and Exchange Commission.
</P>
<P>
   Readers can learn that Goldman pays $35,862,435 each year to
Metropolitan Life Corp. of New York to rent land. The land is
defined obliquely as ``beginning at the corner formed by the
intersection of the northerly side of Pearl Street with the
easterly side of Broad Street, then still southerly along westerly
line of Stone Street and forming an angle of 153 degrees 30 minutes
16 seconds on its westerly side.''
</P>
<P>
   This land is said to be located in the City of New York, County
of New York, State of New York,'' though the reader is left to
surmise that it is included in the United States. It is possible to
determine after searching the appendices that this area contains
Goldman's headquarters at 85 Broad St.
</P>
<P>
   A report on the condition of Goldman's offices at One Carter
Lane in London notes a troubling-sounding loss of fluid in the
``system one Altu filter indicator,'' and documents scratches on
the transom of an elevator, bay 50, at the same location. But
admirers of Goldman's proven agility will be pleased to read that
``a dedicated movement joint is located in the E-W direction along
the demise line between One Carter Lane and the site of One Old
Change Court.''
</P>
<P>
   The prospectus says that 41 percent of the Forbes 400 list of
the world's richest people maintain private investment accounts at
Goldman. The firm is spending $150 million to update its computer
systems to handle four-digit dates so they won't crash when the
millennium begins. The firm has committed about $3 billion to
private investments around the world.
</P>
<P>
   There were five days last year in which Goldman's traders earned
the firm more than $60 million, but nine days in which they lost
more than more than $60 million. That undoubtedly led to a great
deal of fingernail biting in the area bounded by the westerly side
of Stone Street and northerly side of Pearl Street.

   A Truck, a Train and a Fatal Encounter
</P>
<P>
   An Amtrak train heading from Chicago to New Orleans crashed into
a truck at a crossing in Bourbonnais, Ill., 50 miles south of
Chicago, raising fresh questions about the safety of the country's
track crossings. Eleven people were killed and more than 100 were
injured.
</P>
<P>
   The truck driver said the gates started closing after he was
already crossing, but another truck driver behind him reportedly
told investigators he saw the truck enter the tracks despite
flashing warning lights. Investigators were trying to determine if
the driver of the truck, which was loaded with steel bars, was
attempting to go around the gates as they were descending. If tire
tracks found nearby match those of the truck, they would show that
the driver tried to defeat the system, investigators said.

   Bombing Threatened
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton said NATO must be ready to carry out
airstrikes against the Serbs, who have acted in a manner that
provoked a military response. Calling his first full news
conference in almost a year, Clinton said, ``Hesitation is a
license to kill.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton not only discussed bombing Kosovo but also addressed his
administration's handling of China's suspected theft of secrets
from U.S. nuclear labs in the 1980s. ``To the best of my knowledge,
no one has said anything to me about any espionage which occurred
by the Chinese against the labs during my presidency,'' he said.

provoked a military response. Calling his first full news
conference in almost a year, Clinton said, ``Hesitation is a
license to kill.''

<P>
   Clinton not only discussed bombing Kosovo but also addressed his
administration's handling of China's suspected theft of secrets
from U.S. nuclear labs in the 1980s. ``To the best of my knowledge,
no one has said anything to me about any espionage which occurred
by the Chinese against the labs during my presidency,'' he said.

<P>
   How to reduce adolescent violence and other risky behavior while
fostering an interest in learning? Starting in first grade,
researchers in Seattle say, treat children with respect, encourage
them to cooperate with one another and their teachers, reward their
accomplishments, give them a quiet place to do their homework and
teach them how to say no without losing friends and status.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. J. David Hawkins and a team of social scientists at the
University of Washington instituted a test program in first grade
in Seattle's toughest schools and continued it through sixth grade.
At the end, students in the program were significantly less likely
to have committed violent acts, indulged in heavy drinking, engaged
in sexual intercourse or caused a pregnancy or become pregnant than
students at comparable schools with no special intervention.

   Despite seven straight years of falling crime, the number of
inmates in the nation's jails and prisons climbed again last year,
to a record 1.8 million, the Justice Department reported. The rise
in the prison population is not the result of more effective police
department policies. It is but largely the outcome of the
get-tough-on-crime movement in this country: politicians
legislating mandatory sentences, prosecutors pushing to make sure
more offenders are locked up, judges giving longer sentences and
parole boards less willing to let convicts out early.

A PSYCHIATRIST USES HYPNOTISM TO HELP HIS FLIGHT
</HEADLINE>
  (See also BALLOONIST, JONES-PROFILE)  
(DW) 
 By MALCOLM W. BROWNE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   By profession, Bertrand Piccard is a Swiss psychiatrist. By
avocation, he is a pioneer, from a family of noted scientific
adventurers.
</P>
<P>
   Piccard, 41, the Swiss captain of the Breitling Orbiter 3
balloon, has been an aviation enthusiast since childhood. An expert
hang-gliding pilot while he was a schoolboy, he became the European
aerobatic hang-gliding champion and established a hang-gliding
altitude record by age 16.
</P>
<P>
   He went on to become a pilot of ultralight airplanes and hot-air
balloons while earning a degree in medicine.
</P>
<P>
   Piccard, who is married and has three daughters, comes from a
family famous for daring, inventiveness and breaking altitude
records in the air and depth records at sea.
</P>
<P>
   His grandfather, Dr. Auguste Piccard, also a medical doctor,
invented the pressurized balloon crew gondola, allowing flights to
very high altitudes. In 1931, flying such a balloon, he became the
first human being to ascend into the stratosphere, at more than
50,000 feet. Dr. Auguste Piccard also invented a deep diving
submersible called the Bathyscaphe.
</P>
<P>
   His son, Jacques Piccard, Bertrand's father, used the
Bathyscaphe to descend to the deepest place on earth _ the Marianas
Trench, 35,815 feet below the surface of the Pacific Ocean.
</P>
<P>
   The Breitling captain, who spent much of his time in recent
years explaining the fine points of ballooning to journalists,
worked closely with the British balloon-maker Don Cameron in
perfecting improvements in balloon design of the kind that brought
the Breitling Orbiter 3 to victory Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the dream of all balloonists, the ultimate flight,''
Piccard said as he entered the capsule on March 1 _ 20 days ago _
with Jones at Chateau-d'Oex, Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
   To honor his grandfather, Bertrand Piccard set off on his second
attempt at the global record last year on the 114th birthday of the
eldest Piccard. This year, he launched his latest test of personal
endurance on his own 41st birthday, watched by his wife, Michele,
and their three young daughters.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Piccard used his medical knowledge on the grueling trip. At
his Lausanne-based practice, Piccard became an advocate of using
hypnosis to help patients. He used self-hypnosis techniques to
overcome stress and to sleep better. When he felt dispirited last
week, he picked up his satellite telephone to call a medical
colleague, who reportedly perked up Piccard through hypnosis.
</P>
<P>
   In a satellite phone hookup on Friday, Piccard burst into tears
when the control center directors told him there would be
sufficient fuel and good enough weather to land in Egypt, bringing
him full circle to his goal.
</P>
<P>
   Success has not come easily. Piccard and his then-flying
partner, Wim Verstraeten, became the first balloonists to cross the
Atlantic in 1992. Then the pair failed twice to circle the globe,
first in 1997 when the toxic fumes in the cabin from a fuel leak
forced their flight down over the Mediterranean, and again in 1998,
when the Breitling Orbiter 2 landed in a rice paddy in Myanmar.
</P>
<P>
   In planning his epic flight, Piccard adapted some of the lessons
learned by his grandfather, including the idea of partially
inflating the balloon at takeoff, instead of a full inflation, to
allow for gas expansion at higher altitudes.
</P>
<P>
   He also tapped into experiences of his father, now 76, who once
worked for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.
</P>
<P>
   Drawing on Jacques' data from travels on the ocean's Gulf
Stream, the younger Piccard calculated the jet stream currents that
would help the balloon travel faster.  &QL;

   Dear Parent or Guardian:
</P>
<P>
   Congratulations on 987-65-4321's admission to Arizona State
University! We commend you for the significant role that you have
played in helping him to prepare for this exciting and critically
important time. A.S.U. is committed to providing an outstanding
collegiate experience, and we are pleased that he has chosen to
take advantage of this tremendous opportunity. We are fully
prepared to assist 987-65-4321 in making a successful transition
from high school to college.
</P>
<P>
   We also recognize that even though your relationship with
987-65-4321 may change in the next few years, the importance of
that relationship will not diminish. At Arizona State University,
we value your continued participation in his academic, social and
personal development and actively seek your support in that
endeavor. Whether through involvement in the A.S.U. Parents
Association, attendance at numerous events for A.S.U. parents, or
the occasional visit to campus, you will be a partner with the
university in encouraging 987-65-4321 to succeed.
</P>
<P>
   We look forward to seeing you at an orientation program and
during A.S.U. Welcome Week prior to the start of the fall semester.
Information about these programs has been mailed to 987-65-4321.
Many of the activities during both events are designed specifically
for you. In the meantime, contact the A.S.U. Parent Programs office
. . . if you have any questions or concerns.

   The father's reply:
</P>
<P>
   Dear Ms. Olson:
</P>
<P>
   Thank you for offering our son, 987-65-4321, or as we
affectionately refer to him around the house _ 987 _ a position in
the A.S.U. class of 2003. His mother, 123-45-6MOM and I are very
happy that such a prestigious institution of higher education such
as A.S.U. has extended this offer.
</P>
<P>
   In selecting a college for 987, we are looking for a place that
will prepare him for the technological challenges of the 21st
century. We seek a college in which he can learn to master
computers and learn to communicate with clarity and sensitivity. I
can only imagine the competence with which you will, as your letter
puts it so well, ``assist 987-65-4321 in making a successful
transition from high school to college.''
</P>
<P>
   We will miss 987 when he goes off to school, and are very
interested in a college in which he will receive personal
attention. I was particularly touched by your sentence in which you
note that our ``relationship with 987-65-4321 may change in the
next few years.'' This is certainly true. Already we are beginning
to focus as well on his brother, 123-45-6BRO.
</P>
<P>
   I look forward to additional communications from your office.
You manage to convey more in your letters that any other college we
have seen thus far. And believe me, we are still looking.
</P>
<P>
   Sincerely,
</P>
<P>
   123-45-6DAD

Harvard, Yale and Dartmouth.

learning. Consider the following form letter from Arizona State
University, in which a prospective student's Social Security number
was inadvertently substituted for his name.
</P>
<P>
   The university says only a handful of such faulty letters were
mailed _ out of thousands sent out recently by the college's
parents association _ and the glitch has been corrected.
</P>
<P>
   One was enough, though, as the father's cheeky response below
attests. All the Social Security numbers have been fictionalized.

</P>
<P>
   President, A.S.U. Parents Association
</P>
<P>
   Laura M. Burgis,
</P>
<P>
   Assistant Director, Parent Programs
</P>
<P>
   The father's reply:
</P>
<P>
   Dear Ms. Olson:
</P>
<P>
   Thank you for offering our son, 987-65-4321, or as we
affectionately refer to him around the house _ 987 _ a position in
the A.S.U. class of 2003. His mother, 123-45-6MOM and I are very
happy that such a prestigious institution of higher education such
as A.S.U. has extended this offer.
</P>
<P>
   In selecting a college for 987, we are looking for a place that
will prepare him for the technological challenges of the 21st
century. We seek a college in which he can learn to master
computers and learn to communicate with clarity and sensitivity. I
can only imagine the competence with which you will, as your letter
puts it so well, ``assist 987-65-4321 in making a successful
transition from high school to college.''
</P>
<P>
   We will miss 987 when he goes off to school, and are very
interested in a college in which he will receive personal
attention. I was particularly touched by your sentence in which you
note that our ``relationship with 987-65-4321 may change in the
next few years.'' This is certainly true. Already we are beginning
to focus as well on his brother, 123-45-6BRO.
</P>
<P>
   I look forward to additional communications from your office.
You manage to convey more in your letters that any other college we
have seen thus far. And believe me, we are still looking.
</P>
<P>
   Sincerely,
</P>
<P>
   123-45-6DAD
</P>
<P>
   A.k.a. Jeff Bradley
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Bradley and 987-65-4321 are still waiting to hear from
Harvard, Yale and Dartmouth.

A MODEST SORT OF BRITON, FLUNG SUDDENLY INTO FAME 
</HEADLINE>
   (See also BALLOOONISTS, PICCARD-PROFILE) 
 (DW) 
 By SARAH LYALL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Brian Jones, the co-pilot on the Breitling mission,
would have remained a quiet but crucial part of his team's
ballooning effort if it had not been for a series of lucky breaks.
</P>
<P>
   Jones, who is to turn 52 next week, is actually the team's third
co-pilot. The first, Wim Verstraeten of Belgium, the longtime
flying partner of Bertrand Piccard, the pilot, pulled out of the
effort after a failed mission by Breitling 2 a year ago. Then the
second, Anthony Brown of Britain, quit last November over
differences in style and personality with Piccard. That left the
back-up man, Jones, Breitling's project manager, who had taken the
necessary flight training and was poised to step into place.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Britain's high-profile balloonist, Richard Branson, the
billionaire businessman whose own around-the-world effort most
recently was thwarted when he had to land in the sea last
Christmas, Jones is unknown here except in ballooning circles. He
is no swashbuckler.
</P>
<P>
   ``Brian Jones seems the most unlikely person to become the most
famous balloonist in England,'' John Christopher, the editor of
Aerostat, a magazine for professional balloonists, told the Press
Association here. ``He is an ordinary, very likable guy who is not
a great egotist or publicist.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He is very easygoing, with no spectacular achievements in his
past,'' Christopher added, calling Jones ``a very experienced and
all-around balloonist who has suddenly found himself in this
extraordinary position.''
</P>
<P>
   Born in Bristol in 1947, Jones learned to fly at 16, dropping
out of school a year later to join the Royal Air Force. After 13
years of service, he joined a catering business and, in the 1980s,
set about becoming a professional balloonist.
</P>
<P>
   After earning his commercial balloon flying license, Jones
became a ballooning instructor in 1989 and was certified as an
examiner for balloon flight licenses by the British Civil Aviation
Authority.
</P>
<P>
   He helped organize Breitling's most recent around-the-world
attempts, in 1997 and 1998. Until he moved from his position as
back-up pilot to pilot, he was an on-the-ground man, responsible as
the team's project manager for the construction of both the
balloon's gondola and its flight systems.
</P>
<P>
   His wife of nearly nine years, Joanna, 45, is also a balloonist
and has been in Breitling's flight control center at Geneva Airport
since the balloon was launched on March 1.
</P>
<P>
   Jones, who lives in the town of Erlestoke, Wiltshire, has two
children and three grandchildren.

LATIN AMERICA'S CONTAGION: WHERE TAXES AREN'T SO CERTAIN

<P>
   QUITO, Ecuador _ As the year began, the Ecuadorean government
was nearing bankruptcy, unable to pay teachers, doctors and other
public employees or to repair $2.6 billion in damage inflicted by
El Nino.
</P>
<P>
   Another example of global economic contagion? Not directly. It
reflected a much older, if related, problem in Latin America _ tax
evasion. Here it had become so bad that the Ecuadorean Congress
took a truly unorthodox step: It abolished the income tax
altogether in favor of a 1 percent tax on financial transactions.
</P>
<P>
   Ecuador's move was ``an act of extraordinary desperation and an
admission of defeat,'' as one U.S. aid official put it last week.
In effect, it wrote off the 60 percent or more of taxpayers here
who are thought to be dodging their obligations, in hopes that the
new tax would be easier to collect.
</P>
<P>
   Americans grumbling over their 1040 returns this month might be
envious. But there is a sobering context: Governments all over
Latin America are coming under pressure from the International
Monetary Fund and other lenders to cut their yawning budget
deficits and open their economies to the outside world to prevent
the spread of the financial slump that has humbled Southeast Asia
and crippled Russia (a country with severe tax collection problems
of its own).
</P>
<P>
   Latin America may yet prove particularly vulnerable to this
contagion because development and growth are already crippled by
the inability to collect taxes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there is any more vital issue in Latin America
right now,'' said Michael Shifter, a senior fellow at the
Washington-based policy analysis group Inter-American Dialogue.
``It's a vicious cycle that is very, very hard to break. People
don't want to pay taxes because they say government doesn't deliver
services, but government institutions aren't going to perform any
better until they have resources, which they obtain when people pay
their taxes.''
</P>
<P>
   One measure of the dimension of the problem is that Brazil,
Ecuador and other governments that have been forced to carry out a
``fiscal adjustment'' have preferred to emphasize spending cuts
over new ways to increase revenues. ``Since there is a culture of
noncompliance in the region,'' said Luisa Rains, an economist who
heads the fiscal division of the Inter-American Development Bank,
``you're going to run into resistance and affect various interest
groups any time you attempt a real tax modernization.''
</P>
<P>
   When Guatemala, another glaring example, signed a United
Nations-sponsored peace accord ending its civil war in 1996, it
promised to nearly double its tax revenues, to 12 percent of gross
domestic product. But the country has failed to comply, and
therefore is unable to adequately finance the education, health and
land reform programs the accord stipulates. A powerful coalition of
agricultural, industrial and financial groups is simply refusing to
pay up and has blocked all efforts at tax reform.
</P>
<P>
   Guatemala, of course, is not the only Latin American country
famous for the gulf that separates the few who are rich from the
many who are poor, and sometimes governments tolerate tax evasion
because they are simply too weak to do otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   In other cases, as in Mexico, or in Brazil and other military
dictatorships during the 1970s, they do so with political advantage
in mind. Newspapers and television stations, for instance, were
allowed to evade obligations with the understanding that their
debts would be called in if they published material that angered
the government.
</P>
<P>
   Even today, many large Latin America companies simply hold onto
the income tax and social security payments they deduct from their
employees' paychecks. Bribery of tax inspectors, underdeclaration
of income and hiding ownership of property are other popular forms
of evasion.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Leona Helmsley came out and said only little guys pay
taxes, she ended up with a jail term,'' Ms. Rains recalled. ``But
in any number of Latin American countries, tax codes do not even
treat the failure to pay taxes as a crime that requires you to
serve a jail sentence.'' Even when arrests are made, cases can drag
on for years.
</P>
<P>
   Because of their inability or unwillingness to collect income
taxes, Latin American countries have traditionally relied on
measures such as the value-added tax, which runs as high as
Uruguay's 23 percent. But such forms of taxation are highly
regressive, placing a heavy burden on the poor and stoking their
resentment.
</P>
<P>
   The problem may be especially acute in this Andean nation of 12
million people, which is in the midst of its worst economic crisis
since the Great Depression. ``Nobody pays taxes,'' a longtime
diplomat here said. ``Those in a position to pay the most pay the
least, and then they cry the most.'' As a result, he continued,
``the poor say, `Why should we pay if the rich don't?'''
</P>
<P>
   The flat tax on financial transactions that Ecuador enacted last
January (and that resembles a measure approved by Brazil's Congress
last week), was supposed to curb the possibilities for evasion. But
once again, the citizenry demonstrated an exceptional ability to
find a way around paying up.
</P>
<P>
   As soon as the new tax was imposed, local bank deposits dropped
16 percent. Canny depositors simply converted their sucres into
dollars and then spirited their money out of the country. That led
to a run on the local currency that saw its value drop by more than
40 percent in just a few weeks. So last week, President Jamil
Mahuad again gave up in desperation. He agreed to restore the
income tax, though without specifying how he intends to enforce
collection.

PRIMAKOV'S FATE AT HOME RESTS WITH MISSION IN U.S. 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By MICHAEL R. GORDON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ In his long and somewhat mysterious political career,
Yevgeny Primakov has dealt with the United States in many guises:
reform communist, intelligence chief and an occasionally
quarrelsome foreign minister.
</P>
<P>
   But now, as prime minister and effective leader of the Russian
government under an erratic, ailing and jealous President Boris
Yeltsin, Primakov is facing one of his most important challenges.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington this week, his goal will be to win several billion
dollars in credits from a skeptical International Monetary Fund.
The prize would help Russia to regain a modicum of respectability
on the world financial markets and to restructure its colossal
foreign debt.
</P>
<P>
   It would also make Primakov a conquering hero at home, with
greatly improved chances of succeeding Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
   It is a testimony to his dogged persistence _ and the anxiety of
the West about Russia's stability _ that he is likely, eventually,
to prevail, despite an economic policy that is little more than a
vague and sometimes contradictory prescription for muddling
through.
</P>
<P>
   His supporters say this is all the West can expect from a nation
exhausted by its tainted experiment with capitalism. With Yeltsin's
health fading by the day and Russia's market reformers in political
exile, they say, the United States would be wise to recognize
Primakov as its best bet.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact is we have had a more or less stable situation,''
said Yuri Kobaladze, the deputy director of the Itar-Tass
government news agency, who also worked for Primakov when he ran
the nation's intelligence service. ``Nobody else could have
achieved this very small positive result.''
</P>
<P>
   To his critics, however, Primakov is a classic Soviet
apparatchik, an official who has established a political
equilibrium largely by avoiding the tough decisions needed to yank
Russia out of its economic mire.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is part Andropov and part Brezhnev,'' said Andrei
Piontkovsky, one of Russia's leading political analysts, referring
to Yuri Andropov, the former Soviet leader and KGB chief who urged
discipline, and Leonid Brezhnev, the stolid Soviet leader who
preceded him and presided over 18 years of social and economic
stagnation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like Andropov, he has been efficiently promoting people from
the former KGB community. Like Brezhnev, his style for running the
country is to do nothing,'' Piontkovsky added.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody would deny that the 69-year-old Primakov inherited an
onerous situation when he became prime minister following the
financial crisis in August.
</P>
<P>
   The ruble had crashed. Inflation was soaring and the harvest was
a bust. Critics warned that Primakov would blunder his way into an
even greater financial debacle.
</P>
<P>
   However rich his experience in Kremlin intrigue, nothing had
prepared him for this. Born in Kiev and raised in Tbilisi, now the
capitals of Ukraine and Georgia, he studied at the Institute of
Oriental Studies in Moscow and became a Pravda correspondent in the
Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   In those days, Soviet correspondents were often spies or
collaborators with Soviet intelligence. Many Western analysts
assume that Primakov was no exception, though Primakov vigorously
denies it.
</P>
<P>
   For a leader who has cultivated a reputation as a steely
defender of Russian interests, Primakov remains surprisingly
sensitive about his image in the West. Nothing seems to rankle him
more than the charge that he is an unreconstructed intelligence
operative or Cold Warrior.
</P>
<P>
   ``I won't kill you, so don't kill me,'' he implored at the start
of an interview with The New York Times last year, when he was
still foreign minister.
</P>
<P>
   Then he waved a sheaf of critical editorials and columns from
U.S. newspapers in dismay. ``It is unpleasant for me that the
American press sometimes depicts me as some kind of monster,''
Primakov said. ``I like the satirical articles of Art Buchwald.
Those are classics.''
</P>
<P>
   The image Primakov likes to project is that of a
scholar-turned-government-minister who never intended to climb the
rungs of power. His heavy glasses and mumbled speech are
reminiscent of those of Soviet leaders, and that serves as an odd
public relations advantage in a nation where the older population
and left-wing opposition are still nostalgic for the communist
past. Not everyone, however, takes Primakov's humility at face
value.
</P>
<P>
   ``The assertions that Primakov did not have career ambitions are
all exaggerated,'' the newspaper Moskovsky Komsomolets wrote in
October. Following Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in August 1990,
Primakov persuaded the Soviet leader, Mikhail Gorbachev, to
authorize a round of shuttle diplomacy, casting himself in the
starring role, the newspaper noted.
</P>
<P>
   The Soviet foreign minister, Eduard Shevardnadze, was so unhappy
with Primakov's self-appointed mission that he alerted the
Americans to the fact that he had opposed it, James Baker,
President Bush's secretary of state, recalled in his memoirs.
</P>
<P>
   Though his diplomacy failed to avert the Persian Gulf war,
Primakov was named chief of foreign intelligence. He was the
highest-ranking official to hang onto his post despite the collapse
of the Soviet state.
</P>
<P>
   Quietly tending to his spycraft, however, was not enough. From
his intelligence post, he issued a stern report on NATO expansion,
assailing the United States for taking advantage of a weakened
Russia. That made him a politically convenient choice to become
foreign minister in January 1996, when Yeltsin decided that his
pro-Western foreign minister, Andrei Kozyrev, had become a
political liability.
</P>
<P>
   Even then, Primakov kept up his nationalist rhetoric, though he
was always careful to keep Russian-American relations one step
short of confrontation, for instance over the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   ``We Russians have been in the Balkans for 200 years,'' Primakov
said in his Times interview. ``Once I told my American friends, it
reminds me of a situation where we Russians come to Mexico without
taking into consideration the opinion of the United States. Of
course, the United States knows the situation in Mexico much
better. First, they had taken away Texas. Now they are acting
through NAFTA to prevent the repopulation of Texas by Mexicans.''
</P>
<P>
   Those kinds of barbs, as well as his criticisms of the IMF,
endeared him to the left-wing opposition. After the August
financial collapse, Primakov became the consensus candidate for
prime minister, acceptable both to the communists who dominate
Parliament and to some market reformers.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In Russia's topsy-turvy politics, Primakov has won the warmest
praise for what he has not done as prime minister. He has not
renationalized key industries, enforced Draconian currency controls
or flooded the country with newly printed rubles.
</P>
<P>
   But he has also done little to keep Russia marching along the
path of market reform. His government team _ an ungainly coalition
of Communists and Social Democrats _ has never spelled out its
economic plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is Primakov's secret?'' the newspaper Segodnya recently
asked. ``It is his solid outward appearance and his measured manner
of expression. It seems he says nothing special, yet his words
sound weighty. As a result, everyone hears what they want. Liberals
hear `market,' and communists `state regulation.'''
</P>
<P>
   Uninspiring and murky though it may be, the message seems to
work, at least to a point. Public opinion polls indicate that he is
the most trusted of Russia's generally detested politicians.
Primakov was supported by 27 percent of those surveyed this month
by the Public Opinion Foundation, several points ahead of the
second most popular politician: Gennady Zyuganov, the Communist
leader.
</P>
<P>
   Primakov, however, is not relying on the polls. He has cemented
his control of the bureaucracy by inserting former aides at the
intelligence agency in key positions.
</P>
<P>
   Kobaladze, a suave executive at Itar-Tass who previously served
as the spokesman for the foreign intelligence service, is just one
member of the fraternity. Lev Koshlyakov, a former intelligence
officer in Australia and Norway, is now chief of the news division
of RTR, the government television channel.
</P>
<P>
   Grigory Rapota, a former Primakov aide at the intelligence
agency, heads the powerful Rosvooruzheniye, the government company
in charge of selling arms.
</P>
<P>
   Another loyal Primakov aide now runs the Customs Service. Along
with the Rosvooruzheniye appointment, that gives Primakov control
of two of the government's leading sources of revenue, tightening
his authority over the government and giving him the important
advantage of a potential source of campaign funds, Piontkovsky
said.
</P>
<P>
   As he has in the past, Primakov insists that he has no higher
aspirations. He is certainly interested, however, in extending the
Kremlin's power. Primakov's authoritarian streak recently surfaced
when he proposed that local governors be appointed by the Kremlin
instead of chosen by the voters, a step that would require amending
the Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   Much of Primakov's jockeying for power appears to have
displeased Yeltsin. But so far the president has been too weakened
physically and politically to do much about it.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin, however, has made it clear that he expects Primakov to
deliver the credits from the IMF. Aides to the president have even
hinted that Primakov might be ousted if he falls short.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, Primakov has done his best to create the proper
atmosphere for this week's meetings. He has pushed for approval of
the Start II treaty (the Russian Parliament is scheduled to begin
debate on ratifying the treaty on April 2). And he has cooperated
just enough on halting Serbian repression in Kosovo to avoid a
head-on fight with the United States.
</P>
<P>
   His favorable working relationship with Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright is well known; he even made a surprise phone
call to the secretary one snowy night to wish her a happy New Year.
</P>
<P>
   While Primakov has yet to produce an economic plan, his aides
have sought to close the gap with the IMF, calculating that U.S.
pressure will prompt the fund to settle over the remaining
differences.
</P>
<P>
   None of this, however, will solve all of Primakov's problems.
The IMF funds that Russia hopes to receive would largely offset the
$4.8 billion the government owes the fund this year. The IMF's
blessing would make it easier for the Kremlin to renegotiate other
foreign loans and to unlock about another $1.2 billion in World
Bank and Japanese aid.
</P>
<P>
   But the foreign assistance will not take all of the pressure off
Russia's domestic budget. With tax revenues lagging behind
expectations, experts say, Russia may face further wage delays,
decisions to print more money and rising inflation.
</P>
<P>
   Deeper economic reforms have also been put on hold. The
privatization of state enterprises has all but ground to a halt and
the government has yet to carry out its long-overdue restructuring
of its collapsed banking sector.
</P>
<P>
   Primakov appears to be calculating that Russians' craving for
stability is so strong that they will not be distressed by the
government's inaction.
</P>
<P>
   If he can escape the wrath of Yeltsin, who dismissed two prime
ministers last year, his cautious incrementalism might win him the
presidency next year.
</P>
<P>
   While Primakov denies that he is running for president, he has
made clear that he is aiming at a broader political legacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not want my legacy to be that of KGB agent,'' he said in
his Times interview, alluding to his image in the West.
``Absolutely not.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet he could not resist a telling quip about his days of
intrigue, displaying the humor that is said to mark his private
conversations, in contrast to his dour public demeanor. He recalled
that when he ran the foreign intelligence service, he had invited
several U.S. lawmakers to visit him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two congressmen who visited me asked if they were the first
Americans to visit the headquarters,'' he said. ``I said, `You are
the first who are not our agents.' ''

<TEXT>
<P>
   Back in the West's halcyon days, spring 1991, when Saddam
Hussein had just been vanquished in the gulf war and Eastern Europe
had apparently jettisoned communism for good, few Americans had
even heard of the Serbian leader, Slobodan Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic was cultivating ethnic hatreds and threatening war,
but in a seemingly isolated corner of Europe known to few outsiders
and apparently of little concern to Washington. The Iraqi leader,
by contrast, had invaded a neighboring country and lobbed missiles
at Israel, and was found to have a scary near-ability to launch
weapons of mass destruction in the Middle East, an area of
undeniable strategic importance.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the first post-Cold War decade, however, the
challenges posed by the Iraqi and Serbian leaders appear remarkably
similar, at least in this: Both have become tactical experts at
cornering the world's only superpower, frustrating its diplomatic
strategists, tying down its military and periodically daring the
United States to use force to get its way. Each has laid bare the
lack of a Western strategy to deal with dictators who, simply by
continuing in power, further weaken the ability of their peoples to
resist.
</P>
<P>
   For years, Milosevic and Saddam seem almost to have been playing
tag team with the United States and its allies. A look back at the
1990s reveals some startling similarities in the ways they operate,
and in the ways the West seems to have missed opportunities to
weaken each of them.
</P>
<P>
   Both leaders are skilled autocrats, easily able to exploit the
inevitable differences that crop up in the coalitions, alliances or
international organizations that have tried to rein them in. When
it's convenient, each can count on support from Russia or China. At
home, each is adept at manipulating power and at turning foreign
embargoes, threats or bombing to his own advantage: Who, after all,
would publicly oppose a leader who paints himself as defender of a
victimized nation under foreign attack?
</P>
<P>
   Despite the occasional seeming defeat inflicted from outside,
and the suffering of people in economies squeezed by embargoes and
by the control of these leaders and their cliques, neither man
seems in danger of being dislodged.
</P>
<P>
   As far back as that spring of 1991, before the old Yugoslavia
descended into war, demonstrators in Belgrade picked up on the
similarities, chanting ``Slobo-Saddam!'' to demonize their leader.
With the instinct born of the direct experience of repression, they
sensed that both men were master players of high-stakes poker,
prepared to use violence and even to gamble their very countries to
preserve their own power.
</P>
<P>
   It is a lesson that the West, however, appears to have spent
little time understanding: that the key to the survival of
Milosevic and Saddam has been their intimate acquaintance with the
yearnings and frailties of their people (Milosevic has even won
several flawed but not entirely unfair elections).
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic, who is now president of what is left of Yugoslavia,
has retained power largely by stirring up crisis after crisis, then
uniting Serbs behind his alleged defense of their interests.
Long-term success is not required for his own survival _ he has,
for instance, lost the territories he mobilized Serbs to seize in
Croatia and Bosnia _ so long as the attention of his weary people
can be channeled elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Even now, with NATO threatening to bomb Serbia if Milosevic does
not allow the alliance to police his restive province of Kosovo, he
appears secure. Indeed, he retains the power to ignite a far
bloodier war in Kosovo and beyond, a power that commands the West's
attention. He can survive in his self-cast role as his people's
champion against the hostile, powerful outside world.
</P>
<P>
   So too Saddam. Saddam has lost some formal control over Iraq.
Foreign inspectors have probed his arsenals. The CIA has reportedly
tried to muster resistance inside Iraq. For more than two months,
foreign jets have regularly bombed targets inside the northern and
southern reaches of the country.
</P>
<P>
   These regions are home to the Kurdish minority and the Shiite
Muslim majority who oppose Saddam's Sunni Muslim minority, which
has traditionally ruled Iraq. Yet Saddam, whose security apparatus
is far larger and more ruthless than that of Milosevic, also seems
in no obvious danger of losing control. He retains large oil
reserves, and perhaps even an ability to build weapons of mass
destruction.
</P>
<P>
   Saddam, whose image entirely dominates public life in Iraq,
brooks so little opposition that dissent can be openly voiced only
abroad. America has been slow to engage the admittedly murky and
bitterly divided opposition groups. Belated attempts to do so have
yielded a new radio station, Radio Free Iraq, and a $97 million
Iraqi Liberation Act that so far has dispensed none of the materiel
it pledged to make available to opposition groups. Of the
opposition groups targeted to receive support, at least one
announced from its Tehran headquarters that it had no interest in
Washington's backing.
</P>
<P>
   In Serbia, a number of parties that are now arrayed against
Milosevic sprang up largely as he was assuming power in the late
1980s. He has proven skilled at infiltration and at buying off
these rivals. The opposition is now so feckless that even its
members say they have little hope. Students or independent media
that do challenge Milosevic are weak and immediately feel a
repressive hand if they start to make an impact. They also lack any
significant foreign backing.
</P>
<P>
   Individual diplomats and outside groups have tried to support
what Warren Zimmermann, the last U.S. ambassador to Yugoslavia, has
called ``the other Serbia.'' But during mass demonstrations against
Milosevic that erupted in the winter of 1996, many Serbian students
wondered why the rest of Europe was ignoring their movement. It
was, they felt, as if they were being demonized along with their
leader. The few foreign envoys who do come to Serbia see Milosevic
and pay any others scant heed.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of U.S. diplomacy say that by ignoring Serbs and Iraqis
who oppose Milosevic and Saddam the West has missed a chance to
advance democracy in the Balkans, where the Serbs traditionally
have played a vanguard role, and in the Middle East, where Iraq's
middle class was once among the most enlightened and educated.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, unwittingly, Western policy has helped smash that
vibrant middle class in both countries. Official media drive home
the siege mentality, playing on the threat from outside to squelch
dissent. Tough sanctions have fostered rampant corruption, which
gnaws ever deeper into the moral fiber of societies weakened by
wars the leaders helped to launch.
</P>
<P>
   Emigration has added to the ruin. In both countries, a new
merchant class has sprung up, owing its wealth to smuggling. To ply
their illicit trade, these people must make at least a tacit pact
with their governments and are thus a crucial source of support for
Saddam and Milosevic. They help convey an illusion that the two
countries are still part of the modern world; despite the United
Nations' embargo, almost any consumer wares are available in
Baghdad, as they were in Belgrade when it was under sanctions from
1992 to 1995.
</P>
<P>
   In the Iraqi countryside, the government reportedly gives seed,
land or machinery to traditionally respected rural leaders, who in
turn help ensure obedience. In rural Serbia, the source of most of
Milosevic's votes in elections, the leader and his Socialist Party
can use structures inherited from the old league of communists to
exercise similar control.
</P>
<P>
   Can anything now be done to turn the tide in Serbia, or Iraq? In
both countries, hopeful Clinton administration officials suggest
that the demise of Saddam and Milosevic is closer than either may
believe. If NATO does bomb Serbia, the Yugoslav army might turn
away from Milosevic. But even if he is then forced to accept NATO's
soldiers in Kosovo, he will remain in control of most of Serbia,
with all of its new resentments of the West. High-ranking foreign
visitors could invest in a different future by visiting Milosevic's
critics, as was routinely done, say, in Moscow under the Soviets.
</P>
<P>
   Neither country will change overnight. One journalist who has
lived in Belgrade all her life recently wrote to a friend about a
change she had seen in the last decade in how Serbs treat each
other. A woman tending flowers in a park had hurled an ax at the
journalist's dog, she wrote. Even after Milosevic goes, she
concluded, ``we will be left with all those semihumans'' that the
recent past has created.

   MILWAUKEE _ It slopes up from the old Schlitz Brewery, past
empty lots, storefront churches, Victory over Violence Park and the
Black Holocaust Museum. It burned in two days of racial violence in
1967. Since then, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Drive, once a proud
retailers row, has mostly been known as an asphalt emblem of urban
distress.
</P>
<P>
   But in the first tax season since the state completed its
radical welfare reductions, King Drive has acquired an unlikely new
identity _ as a battleground of bookkeepers. From the Federal
Building at its southern base to the ``Shalom Zone'' of churches in
the north, the tax preparers have arrived in droves, seeking the
business of the neighborhood's new workers.
</P>
<P>
   On a strip once so forlorn it drew a National Guard patrol, H&AMP;R
Block has decorated a spiffy new office with posters of the
Caribbean beaches that beckon those with refunds. Across the
street, at its makeshift quarters in an abandoned bakery, Jackson
Hewitt, another tax preparation service, has been so busy it has
had to double its staff. A few blocks north, at Milwaukee Check
Cashers, a tax business is booming behind the bulletproof glass.
</P>
<P>
   Tax preparation is such a growth industry here that even a
welfare office on King Drive is offering a course in its numerical
arts.
</P>
<P>
   Up and down the avenue, the explanation is the same: Tough
welfare laws are good for business. ``With welfare being cut off
and everything, everybody's got to go back to work,'' said Lorenzo
Cartman, who manages the H&AMP;R Block office on King Drive. ``They
either work or they starve, and I don't think they want to
starve.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Cartman was so confident in his theory _ less welfare
means more work _ that he staked his fortune on it, choosing to
manage the King Drive store over other H&AMP;R Block offices because he
thought it would be easier to meet his performance goals. ``I was
thinking, `First-time filers!' `People finally moving out on their
own!''' he said. ``I liked the numbers.''
</P>
<P>
   But tax season on King Drive is more than a simple morality play
of poor people going to work. It is a showcase of the competing
dynamics involved in the makings of a new working class: low pay
and large government subsidies; old habits and new beginnings;
streetwise versions of the white lies that accompany tax season
everywhere, and a few outright scams.
</P>
<P>
   Tumbling through a temp-job world, former welfare recipients
often arrive at tax offices here with a half-dozen wage statements
from a single year. (The record for W-2 forms seems to have been
set at the Jackson Hewitt office, where one couple counted 22
between them.) But while earnings are low _ $9,087 on the average
return prepared by the check-cashing store _ a growing program of
wage supplements turns tax time into a bonanza. Few families pay
income tax in poor neighborhoods like this, and many collect
thousands of dollars in government bonuses to the working poor.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the $29 billion federal program, called the earned
income tax credit, now transfers more money to the needy in a
single season than welfare did all year. And because Wisconsin is
one of seven states with a similar program of its own, poor people
in Milwaukee can receive combined state and federal payments that
augment their yearly earnings by 30 percent, 40 percent or even 50
percent. A single mother with three children who earns $10,000, for
instance, would qualify for the maximum wage supplement, of $5,371.
That is in addition to the refund of any taxes withheld.
</P>
<P>
   While the action along King Drive depicts a level of
post-welfare success, it also frames deeper questions about the
society being reshaped. More poor people are working, no doubt. And
some do see themselves with expanded paychecks and dreams, as the
architects of the new system had hoped. But others say that working
in the entry-level economy is just another way of staying poor. Is
this an old underclass? A nascent middle-class? Somewhere in
between?
</P>
<P>
   There are hundreds of answers along King Drive this time of
year.
</P>
<P>
   Some new workers talk of starting their own business.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to do my own day care center in my house,'' said Debra
Morton, who collected a $4,100 supplement on earnings of $6,900 and
talks of buying paint and plaster. Ms. Morton has been on and off
welfare for more than a decade, but she left about two years ago to
become a cashier at a discount store. ``Welfare's got a lot of
rules now,'' she said. ``It's better for me if I work.''
</P>
<P>
   Some want to thank the Lord.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has made my day!'' shouted Toni Harris, 28, when she
learned her earnings of $17,000 would bring her a payment of
$1,600. A bank clerk by day, Ms. Harris has a second calling as an
author of spiritual poetry, and she had a line ready for the
occasion:
</P>
<P>
   There are no words to explain my insight
</P>
<P>
   I just praise God for his power and might.
</P>
<P>
   Some want to take a break.
</P>
<P>
   With $1,000 coming back on earnings of $3,100, Valerie
Treadwell, a nursing assistant, plans to continue an annual
tradition: taking her female partner to a resort in Green Bay, ``to
get buck naked and let all our inner feelings out.''
</P>
<P>
   Some have no plans at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know too much about taxes,'' said Derenda Turner, 27,
who has been on welfare since her daughter was born 12 years ago.
With $1,100 in earnings last year _ Ms. Turner worked at Burger
King for two months _ she qualifies for a payment of $400. Puzzled
but pleased, she made a half-hearted pledge to resume work. ``What
is it _ an `earned income tax credit?''' she asked. ``I really got
to get me a job, so I can get some more.''
</P>
<P>
   Since 1990, the number of Wisconsin families receiving credits
has grown by 42 percent. And the average payment has nearly tripled
to $2,088, counting the state and federal credits. For families
with children, the payments rise until earnings hit $9,500, then
level off and slowly decline. Families are ineligible if their
earnings exceed $30,000.
</P>
<P>
   While Congress has turned the federal program into one of the
nation's largest anti-poverty efforts, few people have asked what
the poor do with the money.
</P>
<P>
   Does it help them build new lives?
</P>
<P>
   Some intriguing hints come from Timothy Smeeding and Katherin
Ross of Syracuse University, who surveyed 830 beneficiaries of the
program in Chicago. They found that 26 percent planned to use all
the money for immediate needs, like food, rent, utilities or
clothes. But more than half planned to spend at least some of it on
investments in the future: moving (5 percent); sending themselves
or their children to school (9 percent); buying a car (14 percent);
or saving (28 percent).
</P>
<P>
   Smeeding calls that reassuring news. ``This program is not just
enhancing consumption, but improving social mobility,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   As a window into the city's soul, King Drive has a long history.
It grew up as North Third Street in the mid-19th century and
matured as a fabled stretch of stores. They dazzled an 8-year-old
girl named Golda Mabovitch when she arrived from Russia in 1906.
``Everything looked so colorful and fresh, as though it had just
been created,'' she wrote decades later, as Golda Meir, after
serving as the prime minister of Israel.
</P>
<P>
   By the late 1950s, the stores were moving out to the malls, and
a poor black neighborhood was left behind.
</P>
<P>
   No one is quite sure how the rioting began on July 30, 1967.
Detroit had burned just a week earlier, and Milwaukee was tense
when police responded to a report of broken windows at a Third
Street business. When the violence ended 10 days later, three
people had died and 1,740 had been arrested _ nothing like Detroit,
where 43 people died, but enough to leave the neighborhood shunned
for a generation.
</P>
<P>
   Every state now has tougher welfare laws, but the program that
has hit the Wisconsin streets is especially strict. Virtually
everyone receiving cash assistance must join a work program. Rather
than work for welfare, most recipients simply seek jobs on their
own in the state's strong economy. The rolls in Milwaukee have now
fallen 80 percent from their 1986 peak _ to 7,700 families, from
38,400 _ and more than three-quarters of the decline has occurred
in the last two years.
</P>
<P>
   Though data on their experiences remain scarce, a recent state
survey found that 83 percent had been employed at some point after
leaving welfare. In that sense, at least, the program, Wisconsin
Works, is living up to its nickname: ``W-2.''
</P>
<P>
   That has been good news for Jackson Hewitt, the nation's
second-largest chain of tax preparers. In a typical year, the
offices in Milwaukee see a 20 percent increase in new customers.
This year the figure on King Drive is 38 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Business has also increased at Milwaukee Check Cashers, a neon
hub at the epicenter of the old riot zone. According to a computer
analysis prepared for The New York Times, the store now cashes
$129,000 less in welfare checks each month than it did two years
ago. But the amount of payroll checks it cashes each month has
risen by $355,000. In other words, on that corner of King Drive at
least, for every dollar of lost welfare there has been a $2.69
increase in wages.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are doing more business than ever with our W-2 clients,''
said George Franco, the store's president. ``Instead of one payment
a month, they're cashing checks weekly or biweekly. It's been very
positive for our business.''
</P>
<P>
   Nearby, sales are up at Nefertari's Beauty Salon, and T-Bone's
Pagers is mulling an expansion into cell phones to keep pace with
client demands. Among those monitoring King Drive's sidewalk
economics is Patrick Hunter, 27, who peddles watches and videos
outside the check-cashing store.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot more money out here than there used to be,'' he
said. ``You got more women working. A lot of people waking up to
that _ stability, morals, and values and things.''
</P>
<P>
   Then again, a lot of people are waking up to wages that may
leave stability beyond reach _ often $6 to $7 an hour, and less
than full-time hours.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone has to start somewhere, of course. But as 30,000
Milwaukee families begin their post-welfare lives, it remains
unclear whether their jobs will prove a stepping-stone or a
treadmill.
</P>
<P>
   At 39, Delores Jefferson has packed head cheese at a sausage
factory for the last 14 years. But she has never been hired full
time, and her wage leaves her whispering in embarrassment: $6.35 an
hour. In the past, she has filled in the gaps with welfare. This
year, she took a second job at the post office that literally
leaves her working around the clock.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to be at the meat-packing plant at 9 a.m.,'' she said,
while having her taxes prepared. ``I get off at 3:30 p.m., go home,
eat my dinner, be in bed by 5 p.m. Get up at 11 p.m. Be at the post
office at midnight, get off at 6 a.m. Get a couple hours of sleep _
be at work at 9 a.m.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It works,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Like their clients, the tax preparers themselves are no
strangers to the entry-level economy: They, too, perform low-paid,
seasonal work, with uncertain prospects for advancement. Software
programs make the work routine, and wages in some offices start as
low as $5.50 an hour (with modest end-of-the-season bonuses). Last
year, about 22 of the preparers hired by H&AMP;R Block had come from
the welfare rolls, a recruiting pool for other services, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're not going to get rich, and I tell them they're not
going to get rich,'' said the manager of one commercial service.
``You just hope and pray they don't find a good job, so they'll
come back every year.''
</P>
<P>
   The low labor costs do not necessarily translate into low filing
fees. The IRS sponsors four sites along King Drive where volunteers
prepare returns for free. (One is run by the Opportunities
Industrialization Center, a state subcontractor, as a job-training
program for welfare recipients.) But with as much as half of their
annual income tied up in the tax code, many poor people pay
commercial services to get the money quickly.
</P>
<P>
   At Jackson Hewitt, the charge for a basic tax return begins at
$48. But 65 percent of the clients pay additional fees, starting at
$54, for the firm's ``Accelerated'' electronic service, which
secures the money in about two weeks. (It takes about six weeks
through the mail.) Another 17 percent pay even more for the
``Superfast'' program, a loan through an affiliated bank.
</P>
<P>
   The banks issue ``Superfast'' refunds within three days, and
secure their repayment directly from the IRS. But the effective
interest rate, if calculated on an annual basis, can range from 57
percent to 663 percent, according to bank disclosure forms. (It
depends in part on the size of the loan.) Other companies offer
similar products and rates. Desperate to pay the rent, clients
occasionally surrender nearly $200 in interest and preparation fees
on a $500 refund.
</P>
<P>
   The lure of these electronic programs, in addition to their
speed, is the absence of up-front costs. Those who file paper
returns must front the preparation fees. But electronic filers can
have the costs deducted from the refund.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I had my druthers, I'd rather not see a customer do
`Superfast' or `Accelerated,''' said Shelly Pipjaert, the manager
of Jackson Hewitt's Milwaukee offices. ``It's a shame. It's a lot
of money. But if that's what the customer wants, that's what the
customer gets.''
</P>
<P>
   While the tax credit's focus on work, not welfare, has bolstered
its political support, there have been recent concerns about its
susceptibility to fraud. An audit of the 1994 returns found
improper payments in 26 percent of the claims, a worrisome rate
with costs approaching $30 billion.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Some errors simply stem from confusion over the rules. (To
qualify fully, for instance, parents must live with their children
for at least half the year.) Others come from wholesale fraud. (A
woman outside the H&AMP;R Block office said she has sold her children's
Social Security numbers, for $300, in years when she was ineligible
because she did not work.) And still others arise from street-wise
bartering that may be as socially sanctioned in some neighborhoods
as it is illegal.
</P>
<P>
   Consider, for instance, a single mother on welfare and her
children's absent father. She has no earnings; he earns $10,000 a
year. Without wages, she cannot receive a refund. Without the
children, he is ineligible, too. But if they say their two children
spent half the year with him, they could split a combined state and
federal payment of nearly $4,300.
</P>
<P>
   Government auditors would call this fraud, and it is. But some
poor families see it differently, especially if the father helps
out by paying child support. Ms. Morton, the aspiring day care
provider, said she would have no problem in letting her daughter's
father claim the child even though he lives in Chicago. ``She is
his child and he helps me with her,'' she said. Because she has
four other children _ and the value of the federal credit is capped
after two _ her refund would not be affected.
</P>
<P>
   New anti-fraud efforts appear to have doused the more brazen
schemes. But because eligibility depends on who lives where, a
strict accounting remains difficult.
</P>
<P>
   Among those caught in the government's snare was Hunter, the
street-corner apostle of new values. He now owes more than $2,000
for illegally claiming his girlfriend's baby by another man. ``It
wasn't like it was behind her back,'' he said. ``I bought the baby
some clothes.''
</P>
<P>
   These days, he is caught between self-reproach (``scamming the
tax people is illegal'') and the argument that filing creative tax
returns is an American tradition _ a move toward mainstream values.
``Rich people cheat on their taxes, too,'' he said. As long as
people are working, he said, ``it's not the same as welfare _ there
ain't nobody getting played.''

   With the nation's welfare rolls down 43 percent, President
Clinton, as well as his Republican critics, count the landmark 1996
welfare law as the cornerstone of their respective legacies. That
law replaced a 60-year-old cash safety net with a program of time
limits and work requirements.
</P>
<P>
   No place has come closer than Wisconsin to the goal of ``ending
welfare.'' A decade ago, 100,000 Wisconsin families relied on
public aid. Now 9,000 do.
</P>
<P>
   The changes taking place in the state, particularly in its
largest city, Milwaukee, continue to reverberate in broad and
unpredictable ways. Throughout the year, The New York Times is
returning to Milwaukee to plot the pattern of change.

   GORNJA KLINA, Yugoslavia _ Thickset policemen in dark blue
camouflage uniforms blocked the road. They wore outsized flak
jackets and pistols at their belts and swung automatic weapons in
their black-gloved hands.
</P>
<P>
   They waved through a convoy of armored jeeps, and police
personnel carriers and a water truck, clad with crude metal sheets
of armor, machine guns poking out of small slit windows. There was
no other traffic on the road.
</P>
<P>
   Behind the police lay the town of Srbica, home to thousands of
civilians and swollen with some 5,000 refugees from outlying
villages. On Saturday, it was under attack.
</P>
<P>
   Shell fire resounded in the hills and three houses in the town
were in flames. Hundreds of panicked refugees were reported to be
swarming out of the town.
</P>
<P>
   Journalists who gained access described groups of gunmen, in
white snow-camouflage and black masks, driving around the town, and
tanks and armored vehicles ranged in positions through the town.
</P>
<P>
   It was just hours after some 1,300 foreign monitors with the
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe had pulled out,
under orders to evacuate to neighboring Macedonia, after peace
talks collapsed in Paris last week and NATO stepped up its threat
of punitive air strikes against Serbia for refusing to negotiate
peace.
</P>
<P>
   Even as the people originally sent in to monitor such movements
left the country, in a coordinated motorcade of bright orange
vehicles to the border, they watched large numbers of Yugoslav army
soldiers on the move.
</P>
<P>
   ``They made signs, they blew kisses. They are pleased to see us
go,'' said one monitor, speaking of the soldiers on condition of
anonymity. He had driven out from Pec, in western Kosovo, and
passed a large column of armor headed the other way. There was also
heavy military activity around the main army base outside Kosovo's
capital, Pristina, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are glad to see the back of us so they can finish the
job,'' the monitor said. ``They have a window of opportunity with
the weather and they are going to put the squeeze on.'' Kosovo lay
coated in snow and beneath low clouds, and the roads were thick
with ice Saturday _ not good weather for NATO to bomb, the monitor
pointed out.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, as the peace talks shut down in Paris and President
Clinton warned the Serbs that they had crossed the threshold of
acceptable behavior, nonessential foreign diplomats and their
families began to leave Belgrade, the capital of Yugoslavia, which
consists of Serbia and Montenegro. NATO's secretary-general, Javier
Solana, and other foreign leaders warned the Serbs that air strikes
could come within days.
</P>
<P>
   But neither those warnings nor the weather deterred the Serbian
security forces _ heavily armed police and the army _ apparently
intent on pressing their offensive against soldiers of the Kosovo
Liberation Army in the Drenica region. This hilly region lies
northwest of Pristina and is the stronghold of the ethnic Albanian
rebels who began fighting the Serbs just over a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Their Kosovo Liberation Army _ financed by the Albanian diaspora
and backed by the heavily ethnic Albanian population of this
southern Serbian province _ has grown in that year from a ragtag
force equipped with World War II-era guns to a far more uniformed
and disciplined group increasingly equipped with sophisticated
weapons, as well as the standard Kalashnikov rifle.
</P>
<P>
   But those weapons are still no match for the heavy armor of the
Serbs. On Saturday, tanks were ranged in firing position and
mortars set up along the road looking south over the villages in
the Cicavica mountain range.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Police manned a new position, and aimed their guns out from
newly constructed sandbagged defenses. Columns of troop trucks and
army artillery guns were drawn up in organized groups beside the
road.
</P>
<P>
   In Srbica itself, foreign journalists who gained access found a
very heavy military presence in the small town. Tanks were blasting
away at villages in the hills, these journalists said, while bands
of armed men in black masks were driving around, piled into and
even riding on top of civilian cars.
</P>
<P>
   Farther north, the main road to Belgrade was cut by fighting.
Police said the rebels had attacked a police station at Luzane
Friday evening. That could not be independently confirmed, but
shooting and shelling continued much of Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Since October, the 1,300 foreign monitors who left Saturday have
kept a check on army and police movements, trailing military
convoys and watching their exercises and operations. While they
were not able to force them to keep to barracks, the presence of
the monitors appeared to have a restraining effect. They had some
success, especially in negotiating local cease-fires.
</P>
<P>
   As the foreigners left, many ethnic Albanians said they feared
that Serbian forces would unleash the full might of their
firepower. A woman who gave her name only as Sofi was walking back
to her house on the outskirts of Gornja Klina, to bring food to her
husband and sons.
</P>
<P>
   She had fled the village when shells landed in the area Monday.
She had heard that the monitors were leaving and said she now
wanted to persuade her husband to abandon the house and follow
suit.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a lot of fear, everyone feels it,'' she said. ``When
we fled the OSCE was there, they helped us. But now I do not know
what will happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of the monitors expressed unhappiness at leaving, even
though their job as unarmed monitors had been increasingly
frustrating.
</P>
<P>
   William Walker, the American head of the verification mission in
Kosovo, acknowledged the problem. ``None of us are happy,'' he
said. ``All of us would want to stay.'' He added that the mission
was now redundant, and that he hoped the monitors' withdrawal would
help break the current deadlock.

RULING SAYS CHIRAC CAN'T BE PROSECUTED ON CORRUPTION CHARGES 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By CRAIG R. WHITNEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ A French prosecutor has ruled that President Jacques
Chirac cannot be prosecuted while in office on political corruption
charges stemming from his years as mayor of Paris and leader of his
conservative Gaullist party.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecutor, Yves Bot, told investigating judges who are
probing illegal party financing that article 68 of the French
Constitution, written for Gen. Charles de Gaulle in 1958, appeared
to put French presidents beyond reach of normal justice as long as
they held office. Chirac's current term runs until the spring of
2002.
</P>
<P>
   French news media have reported that investigating magistrate
Patrick Desmure had turned up a handwritten letter from Chirac when
he was mayor of Paris, in December 1993, recommending a promotion
for a city employee because she had done good work for nine years
for his party adviser on agricultural affairs.
</P>
<P>
   The text of the letter, published in the daily Liberation last
Wednesday, did not say the employee had been illegally transferred
to work for Chirac's party, the Rally for the Republic. But all
French newspapers said that what it meant was that the employee
worked at taxpayers' expense in the party's headquarters on the
other side of Paris.
</P>
<P>
   Even the daily Le Figaro, usually fiercely loyal to Chirac and
his party, reported Saturday morning, ``Judge Desmure is believed
to be persuaded that the person concerned never actually occupied
an office in City Hall, being instead almost entirely in the
service of the Rally for the Republic.''
</P>
<P>
   In France, criminal investigations are carried out by special
judges who report their findings to prosecutors. Desmure asked his
prosecutor, Bot, for a ruling on whether the judge could proceed
with an investigation of Chirac, who was mayor of Paris from 1977
to 1995 and the leader of his party for most of that time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I gave Desmure a ruling tending to confirm lack of
jurisdiction,'' was all the prosecutor would say to reporters late
Friday night, denying an earlier report by Agence France-Presse
that said he had made exactly the opposite ruling.
</P>
<P>
   The French news agency retracted the erroneous report Friday
night, and Chirac's office publicly demanded an official inquiry
into all the leaks of what was supposed to be privileged court
information.
</P>
<P>
   A French president can be impeached for high treason, but only
by something called the High Court of Justice, a court never yet
convened in the 41-year history of the Fifth Republic.
</P>
<P>
   The possibility that Chirac might be called to account in one of
the myriad corruption investigations that have shaken up standard
party business in France since the late 1980s had all political
Paris holding its breath for most of the week.
</P>
<P>
   Until judges like Desmure got the bit between their teeth early
in this decade, every political party, right or left, conservative
or liberal, apparently financed itself with kickbacks, padded
payrolls, sweetheart contracts and all the other devices that have
tended to accompany corrupt politics around the globe.
</P>
<P>
   French politicians, when asked how this could have gone on for
so long, tend to reply that, earlier, there was no law on party
financing.
</P>
<P>
   Chirac's longtime right-hand man, former Prime Minister Alain
Juppe, is under investigation as part of the inquiry into the way
their party financed itself under Chirac's leadership. Chirac's
successor as mayor, Jean Tiberi, is under investigation, too.

<P>
   Chirac's immunity while in office was confirmed on Jan. 22 by a
ruling of the Constitutional Council, the country's supreme
administrative tribunal.
</P>
<P>
   The council's president is Roland Dumas, a former foreign
minister who figures in a long-running scandal about a former
mistress who says that a state-owned oil company, Elf Aquitaine,
paid her millions of dollars to keep Dumas favorable to Elf's
interests. Dumas, under investigation by another set of
magistrates, has not been formally charged.

   QUITO, Ecuador _ For the moment, the streets are quiet again and
no one except an exiled former president is demanding that the
current head of state, Jamil Mahuad, step down. But even after
cobbling together an accord that ended two weeks of strikes and
political turmoil, Ecuador remains as divided and economically
vulnerable as ever.
</P>
<P>
   As many Ecuadoreans see it, the agreement Mahuad announced
Thursday, ending the state of emergency he had declared a week
earlier and rolling back the price of gasoline in exchange for
pledges of opposition support for other austerity measures, is
little more than a Band-Aid. They fully expect that within a short
time their nation of 12 million will again be in disarray, and they
point to recent history as proof.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything in the politics of this country is about short-term
management,'' said Fernando Carrion, director of the Ecuador branch
of the Latin American Faculty for Social Sciences, a regional
research and analysis group. ``But our real problems are
structural, long-term problems, and we are no closer to a solution
to any of those.''
</P>
<P>
   Even when it was under military rule in the 1970s, Ecuador was
largely spared the political violence and repression so common
elsewhere in South America at the time. But since the return of
civilian democratic rule 20 years ago, one presidency after another
has dissipated its strength and support in quarrels with a
powerful, recalcitrant and fragmented Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the latest political configuration does little to
resolve the country's economic woes, which Mahuad describes as the
worst since the Great Depression. Inflation, at 43 percent, the
highest in Latin America, is expected to rise once Congress
approves the austerity package. The national currency, the sucre,
which has lost 40 percent of its value against the dollar this
year, remains feeble.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, thanks to spendthrift policies of previous
governments, Ecuador will have to make debt payments of $2.6
billion to foreign creditors, and is expected to borrow $1.8
billion more. ``Our problem in the recent past has been that we
think we are living in Miami and not the Andes,'' said Alberto
Acosta, a prominent economic analyst here.
</P>
<P>
   By most measurements, no one emerges from the recent turmoil a
winner, with the possible exception of former President Abdala
Bucaram, who was removed from office in 1997 for mental instability
and is waiting in the wings in Panama for an excuse to return to
power.
</P>
<P>
   Mahuad's popularity and authority have both been weakened by the
crisis, and the political infighting has left the country's
international image and credit rating in tatters.
</P>
<P>
   ``What kind of country changes presidents every six months?''
asked Osvaldo Hurtado, a former president, referring to the three
heads of state in little more than two years. ``How can a country
with this level of instability be taken seriously by the United
States, Europe and the international lending organizations?''
</P>
<P>
   With unions and Indian groups taking to the streets and
opposition parties clamoring for Mahuad's head, the political
structure came very close to breaking down, according to diplomats
here.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, said Leslie Alexander, the American ambassador to
Ecuador, the government even discussed carrying out a
``self-coup,'' as President Alberto Fujimori of Peru did in 1992,
but ``there were enough level-headed people to know it is not
practical.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Vladimiro Alvarez Grau, the interior minister,
said that ``at no moment did the government analyze this
possibility'' since ``we have always counted on the constitutional
vocation of the armed forces and the police for support.''
</P>
<P>
   The only reason Mahuad declared a state of emergency on March 9,
he added, was ``to be able to have the juridical instruments to
permit control of internal order and public security.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the crisis has widened the old fissure between the
capital here, high in the Andes, and Guayaquil, the freewheeling
Pacific Coast port that is the main business center. In a warning
Wednesday to civilian leaders to behave more responsibly, the
military senior command specifically singled out ``regionalism'' as
a destructive force.
</P>
<P>
   But Mahuad had no sooner announced an end to the impasse
paralyzing the country than Leon Febres Cordero, a former president
who is now mayor of Guayaquil, rejected the arrangement in language
intended to arouse regionalist passions. He described Mahuad's
austerity plan as ``collusion against Guayaquil and the coast'' and
called for a popular uprising against the central government.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Adrian Bonilla, a political science professor, argues that
Mahuad's one notable success since taking office last August _
bringing an end to decades of hostilities with neighboring Peru _
has, ironically, helped to heighten domestic tensions within this
small country that, though not a threat to its existence as a
state, are nonetheless disruptive.
</P>
<P>
   ``The border issue has lost relevance, and so national unity
around this question loses force and regional identities
strengthen,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Hurtado maintains that the upsurge in regional squabbling
masks the country's most fundamental problem, which is the virtual
collapse of its banking sector in recent months. Most of the
biggest banks are in Guayaquil, and the government has been under
enormous pressure from Febres Cordero's dominant Social Christian
Party to rescue them, no matter the cost.
</P>
<P>
   ``Regionalism has always existed since Ecuador was constituted
as a republic, but it has grown as a result of the banking
crisis,'' Hurtado said in an interview here. ``The banks have
wrapped themselves in the flag of Guayaquil to prevent their
balance sheets from being read objectively and to prevent the
insolvent banks from being shut down.''
</P>
<P>
   By most calculations, the government has spent nearly $1 billion
bailing out ailing banks with strong political connections, a sum
that is larger than this year's projected budget deficit and almost
as large as the country's reserves. With their own savings accounts
frozen for up to a year by Mahuad's austerity plan, average
Ecuadoreans are irate at what they see as preferential treatment
given to the rich and powerful.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not fair,'' said Ramon Molina, a 62-year-old bus driver,
as he stood in line outside a bank last week, waiting to withdraw
the 50 percent maximum from his account that is permitted by
decree. ``It's our money, and the president has taken it away from
us without our permission so that he can turn around and give it to
people who don't deserve it.''
</P>
<P>
   The costly bank bailout also complicates negotiations with the
International Monetary Fund for a $430 million rescue package that
the country sorely needs in order to reduce its unfavorable trade
balance and attract foreign investors.
</P>
<P>
   Though recent increases in the price of oil have given Mahuad a
bit of a cushion, even with the political accord announced last
week a budget deficit of more than $600 million is expected for
this year.
</P>
<P>
   In a speech Tuesday, Michel Camdessus, managing director of the
IMF, warned that ``there will not be help from the rest of the
world if there is not unity within the country.'' He added, ``There
is only one thing holding us back, the fact that there is no unity
in Ecuador behind an emergency program.''

CANADA LAW DOESN'T GUARD RARE WILDLIFE, GROUPS WARN  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mont.)  By ANTHONY DePALMA   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO _ In just one day, a North American grizzly bear can
lumber across the border from Montana, where it is protected by
law, to the Canadian province of Alberta, where it can be legally
hunted and shot.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, the wetlands and forests where endangered species
like the whooping crane and spotted owl live are protected by
federal laws in the United States. But Canada has no national
endangered species law to protect wildlife or its habitats.
</P>
<P>
   More than 25 years after the United States passed the Endangered
Species Act, wildlife advocates are running out of patience waiting
for Canada to enact its own law. Now two American wildlife
organizations plan to increase the pressure on Canada by
instituting a legal action that raises the threat of trade
sanctions on Canada unless an effective law is passed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The message we're trying to send to them is `Wake up, get
going and move an endangered species act through the government,'
'' said William J. Snape III, legal director of Defenders of
Wildlife, one of the groups involved. ``It's just getting sort of
old.''
</P>
<P>
   The mechanism that will be used to bring pressure on Canada is
the Pelly amendment to the Fisherman's Protective Act of 1967. The
filing of a petition under this amendment requires the U. S.
Secretary of the Interior to evaluate another country's efforts to
comply with international programs to protect endangered species.
If threatened wildlife is being harmed, the interior secretary can
recommend to the president that trade with that country be
suspended.
</P>
<P>
   The amendment was passed in 1971 to give some substance to
international salmon fishing agreements. According to a draft of
the petition that will be brought by Defenders of Wildlife and the
Northwest Ecosystem Alliance, a coalition of wildlife groups,
Canada's failure to pass its own endangered species law violates a
1942 convention to protect wildlife and nature in the Western
Hemisphere.
</P>
<P>
   But more immediately, the groups argue that Canada's inaction is
hurting the United States' own effort at wildlife preservation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Canada's failure to protect such species,'' as the grizzly and
whooping crane, the draft petition notes, ``not only undermines the
millions of dollars spent by the U.S. government on endangered
species protection and recovery programs but constitutes a de facto
subsidy to Canadian landowners and enterprises which are not
required to bear the costs of mitigating the harm caused to
endangered species.''
</P>
<P>
   While the Pelly amendment makes trade sanctions possible, the
likelihood of the United States acting against so important a
trading partner as Canada is considered remote.
</P>
<P>
   ``The odds of trade sanctions actually happening as a result of
this petition are 30 to 40 percent,'' said Snape. ``But this 30 to
40 percent is precisely enough leverage to kick the government in
the pants.''
</P>
<P>
   Snape said the petition will be filed ``imminently.''
</P>
<P>
   Canada's environmental ministry has been trying to get an
endangered species law since at least 1995 and officials say they
will not be bullied by any action from across the border.
</P>
<P>
   ``To us, all this represents or is indicative of is concern by a
number of environmental groups that we're not doing enough in
Canada,'' said Steven G. Curtis, associate director general of the
Canadian Wildlife Service, a branch of the federal Ministry of the
Environment.
</P>
<P>
   Tensions between Ottawa and the provinces over who has
responsibility for species that cross provincial or international
boundaries has been at the heart of the delays. Curtis said the
approach being considered in Ottawa now relies not on imposed
federal minimum standards but rather programs that all Canadian
provinces and territories agree on.
</P>
<P>
   Canadian environmental groups criticized earlier approaches that
left most habitat protection to the provinces. In one instance in
British Columbia, biologists found a rare concentration of nesting
sites for an endangered bird called the marbled murrelet in an old
growth forest that was being clear cut. The province could only get
the logging company to spare two lone yellow cedars with nests, but
without the buffer of other trees, the ancient giants soon toppled.
</P>
<P>
   Curtis said the federal government is considering a stewardship
program that would offer financial incentives and, in some cases,
compensation to landowners who agree to protect wildlife habitat.
</P>
<P>
   A new endangered species bill could be introduced before
Parliament breaks for summer recess, said Curtis.

CHINA TRIES TO FEND OFF U.N. CENSURE OVER RIGHTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: See also U.N.-Women-Treaty)  
(DW) 
 By ELIZABETH OLSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   GENEVA _ Even before the start of this year's meetings of the
U.N. Human Rights Commission, which begins a six-week session on
Monday, China has begun a vigorous campaign to head off possible
censure of its human rights record.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration has yet to indicate whether it will
sponsor such a resolution, but it is under increased pressure to do
so, as both houses of Congress voted unanimously last month to
condemn China at this year's meeting.
</P>
<P>
   China's agreement to engage in dialogue on human rights averted
an anti-Beijing resolution from the 53-member commission last year.
But China has drawn renewed disapproval recently by rounding up
members of outlawed opposition parties and religious dissidents,
torturing prisoners, discriminating against its Christian minority
and imposing restrictions on the press.
</P>
<P>
   During a recent trip to China, Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright warned Chinese officials about their human rights record,
although the Clinton administration generally has sought to
separate the issue from other aspects of U.S.-China relations.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the Chinese Foreign Ministry warned that criticizing
China's record in ``protecting and promoting human rights'' would
be an attempt to ``interfere in China's affairs.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the U.N. human rights chief, Mary Robinson, noted
in a televised interview on Thursday that ``we will, no doubt, be
discussing China'' at the meetings this year.
</P>
<P>
   Along with China, a number of other countries including Cuba,
Iran, Iraq, Congo, Cambodia, Rwanda, Yugoslavia and Afghanistan are
also likely to come under scrutiny by the commission.
</P>
<P>
   The body has no enforcement powers. Its strength lies in casting
a moral spotlight on countries that are not living up to
commitments made under international treaties that recognize a
broad array of political, economic, social and cultural rights.
</P>
<P>
   China escaped formal censure for the past seven years, with the
last resolution in 1997 being defeated by a strong margin. The
margin reflected traditional divisions in voting between Western
countries, led by the United States, and Asian and African nations,
which reject such criticism as undue domestic interference.
</P>
<P>
   Such political divides will be seen in another key battle that
is shaping up this year over whether to condemn Cuba's rights
violations. Cuba's recent trial and sentencing of four
``unpatriotic citizens'' has fueled efforts to examine its
treatment of dissenters. Last year, a condemnatory resolution,
fielded by the United States, missed adoption by three votes.
</P>
<P>
   Cuba's record is likely to be on the docket again this year. An
anti-Havana resolution may be sponsored by an Eastern European
country, according to officials who asked not to be named, because
the U.S. effort has been steadily losing support. Last year, Italy
and France, which co-sponsored the resolution condemning Cuba in
1997, refused to sign on again.
</P>
<P>
   While many nations perceive the condemnations, usually of
developing countries, as unfair interference by the West, not all
Western states escape censure. In each of the past two years, the
commission overrode United States objections and voted for a
worldwide moratorium on executions.
</P>
<P>
   Last year's censure came on the heels of a U.N. investigator's
report that the United States engages in unfair, arbitrary and
racist use of capital punishment. A new report, issued this month,
calls on the United States and other countries to abolish the
practice.
</P>
<P>
   Human rights groups are seeking to have the European Union
sponsor another anti-death-penalty resolution this year, which the
United States, although it will not be listed by name, will do its
best to fend off in order to avoid the political embarrassment of
having other countries point to the resolution as proof the United
States, too, breaches international human rights norms.
</P>
<P>
   As the commission opens its 55th session, the United Nations is
undertaking a restructuring of its human rights bodies.
</P>
<P>
   The restructuring has been motivated in part by the more visible
role by Mrs. Robinson, who took over as rights chief in September
1997 after seven years as Ireland's president.
</P>
<P>
   She is widely credited with turning around the lackluster
Geneva-based human rights center and with launching the idea that
human rights should be ``mainstreamed'' into all U. N. work,
instead of being regarded as a separate task.
</P>
<P>
   In the past year, she has attracted enough new funding to
increase the number of field operations, in which staff members
monitor compliance with human rights norms, to 22 countries,
including Indonesia.

U.N. ADDS ENFORCEMENT MECHANISM TO TREATY FOR WOMEN 
 (DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif.)  By PAUL LEWIS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ Twenty years after it first adopted an
international convention banning all forms of discrimination
against women, the United Nations finally has put some teeth into
it by agreeing on a way to offer abused women independent redress
against violations of their rights.
</P>
<P>
   Human rights and women's groups working for the reform generally
have welcomed it, despite reservations about the need to secure the
consent of individual women before an appeal can be brought before
a new 23-member committee of experts that will rule on claims of
discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would have preferred a free hand in acting for women who
may be detained, have disappeared or be afraid of reprisals if they
complain,'' said Florence Martin, of Amnesty International. ``But
we will be able to work with it.''
</P>
<P>
   The new mechanism, which ran into considerable opposition from a
number of governments, mainly in the developing world, takes the
form of an optional protocol to the Convention on the Elimination
of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women. That convention was
adopted in December 1979 and has been ratified by 163 countries so
far. The 22 countries that have not ratified the convention so far
include the United States and Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
   The new protocol, approved unanimously by the Commission on the
Status of Women at its regular half-yearly meeting here last week,
allows a woman suffering any form of discrimination banned by the
convention to appeal to the experts' committee once she has
exhausted all means of redress in her own country.
</P>
<P>
   Appeals also may be made to the committee by women's
organizations or other bodies acting on behalf of victims. But a
victim must first give consent unless the author of the appeal can
justify acting without it.
</P>
<P>
   The committee may launch its own investigation into a member
state's conduct if it receives ``reliable information indicating
grave or systematic violations'' of the rights afforded women.
</P>
<P>
   The committee has no power to compel a government to change its
behavior. But if it finds a complaint justified, it must inform the
country in question and make recommendations for correcting rights
abuses.
</P>
<P>
   ``We expect the committee to be flexible about the need for
victims' consent,'' said Donna Sullivan, a New York University law
professor working with human rights groups pressing for the new
protocol. ``Many persecuted women lack the education and the money
to complain themselves about human rights abuses.''
</P>
<P>
   A. Widney Brown of Human Rights Watch called the protocol an
important step forward. ``Governments talk a lot about women's
rights but don't do anything concrete to enforce them,'' she added.
</P>
<P>
   U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan hailed the new protocol as ``a
major step forward in realizing governments' commitments to women's
human rights'' and urged states to ratify it.
</P>
<P>
   The convention banning discrimination against women guarantees
women's rights across many fields including employment, education,
voting, nationality, marriage and divorce, health care and equality
before the law.
</P>
<P>
   However, the convention on women has lacked enforcement
mechanism. The fact that it has taken 20 years to create one is
seen by activists as proof of governments' indifference or
hostility toward ending discrimination against women.
</P>
<P>
   ``Private pressure groups put enforcement on the agenda, not
governments,'' Sullivan said. Along with Ms. Martin of Amnesty
International, she identified China, Algeria, Egypt, India and Cuba
as among the governments most hostile towards the new protocol.
</P>
<P>
   A big U.N. human rights conference in Vienna in 1993 first
called for a way to put teeth into the convention on discrimination
against women. The call was repeated at the 1995 U.N. conference on
women held in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   The new protocol will be opened for signature at the next U.N.
General Assembly later this year, and only needs ratification by 10
countries to come into force.
</P>
<P>
   Although President Carter signed the convention on eliminating
discrimination against women, the Senate never ratified it. But the
city of San Francisco recently did so and has started adjusting
rules and regulations to comply with its provisions. Los Angeles
has promised to follow suit.
</P>
<P>
   Many Muslim countries also have ratified the convention on
discrimination against women, including Pakistan, Morocco, Jordan
and Tunisia.

COMMENTARY: OBLIVIOUS AT THE TOP 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By BOB HERBERT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ William Perkins, a city councilman from Harlem, was
among those arrested at police headquarters with David Dinkins and
Charles Rangel last week. It was not his idea of a good time. Even
if you have chosen to offer yourself up for arrest, being in the
custody of police with your hands cuffed behind your back is not
fun.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd all prefer to be doing something else,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But behind the plummeting crime statistics, behind the incessant
trumpeting of New York as a city reined in and refashioned by a
tough-as-nails mayor, lies the fearful reality of police misconduct
so widespread and at times so insanely violent that it has brought
a new kind of terror to the streets of New York.
</P>
<P>
   A black newspaper reporter remarked last week: ``I am afraid to
use my cell phone. All a cop has to say, to justify shooting you,
is, `I thought he was reaching for a gun.' It's too late, after
you're dead, to say, `I was just reaching for my phone.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Perkins is among the growing number of New Yorkers who believe
that Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and Police Commissioner Howard Safir
have shown insufficient concern about the nature and the extent of
the misconduct, and a callous attitude toward the fear and the
anger it has provoked.
</P>
<P>
   I agree. They are something to see, this mayor and this
commissioner. They exude contempt. There is no evidence that either
man really cares about the tragic crumbling of relations between
police and the communities they serve. And they are publicly
scornful of the opposition growing all around them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Leadership,'' said Safir, ``is about standing up to media
hype, demagogues and political agendas.''
</P>
<P>
   Perkins has a different view. ``We have a very serious problem
with police brutality,'' he said. ``But the leadership that should
be provided by the mayor and the police commissioner is just not
there. They seem to be hostile to the fact that people are outraged
and upset about this unfortunate situation _ the Diallo shooting _
and other situations before that.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he did not think that most New Yorkers were anti-cop,
but that a tremendous amount of frustration has built up over
excessive use of force by police, and that people are anxious for
that to change.
</P>
<P>
   ``History has taught us that one way to get change is through
protest and civil disobedience,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   When the plastic flex-cuffs were attached to his wrists on
Monday, Perkins became one of scores of people, many of them
high-profile public officials, who have been arrested at the daily
protests outside police headquarters arranged by the Rev. Al
Sharpton.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani has dismissed the protests as ``silly.'' But while he
may not be listening to the cries of genuine anguish from New
Yorkers concerned about police abuse, plenty of others are. Both
the U.S. attorney in Manhattan, Mary Jo White, and the U.S.
attorney in Brooklyn, Zachary Carter, are investigating the Police
Department. The U.S. Civil Rights Commission voted this month to
hold a public hearing as part of its investigation into allegations
of abuse by police officers.
</P>
<P>
   Last week the state attorney general, Eliot Spitzer, announced
that his office would investigate charges that police officers have
routinely been stopping people on the street, especially
African-Americans and Latinos, and frisking them without
justification. ``There is a tidal wave of concern about this
issue,'' said Spitzer.
</P>
<P>
   He described the relationship between police and residents in
ethnic minority neighborhoods as ``frayed.''
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Mark Green, the public advocate and a political rival
of the mayor, said in a prepared statement that ``the Giuliani
administration's failure to address the problem of police
misconduct has eroded the mutual respect between community and
police that is vital to effective law enforcement.''
</P>
<P>
   He called on Safir to resign.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the arrests outside police headquarters continue.
</P>
<P>
   More and more New Yorkers are acknowledging that police
misconduct is a serious problem. They see what Giuliani apparently
can't see _ that unless the problem is honestly engaged the
consequences for the city will be dire.

<P>
   HERSHEY, Pa. _ During fights on the House floor, they have
plenty of opportunity to snipe. During committee hearings, they
have ample occasion to seethe.
</P>
<P>
   But in this candy-coated realm of chocolate kisses, members of
Congress had a rare chance this weekend to do something different.
They got to share.
</P>
<P>
   Descending on a rambling lodge and conference center for what
was billed as a three-day course in civility, nearly 200
Republicans and Democrats, some with their spouses and children in
tow, came together to exercise their diplomacy and exorcize their
demons, primarily in small discussion groups that were meant,
according to organizers, to provide ``safe environments'' for the
venting of feelings.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers listened on Friday afternoon to a keynote speech by
John Hume, the Nobel-winning architect of peace in Northern
Ireland, on the theory that anyone who could soothe the tensions
there might be able to do as much for Ways and Means.
</P>
<P>
   They were scheduled for line dancing Saturday night at a Family
Country Hoedown, on the theory that if they could kick up their
heels together, then maybe _ just maybe _ they could break the
impasse over Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   These were lofty goals indeed, but not, participants insisted,
beyond all reach.
</P>
<P>
   Reflecting on Hume's address, Rep. Richard Neal, D-Mass., said,
``The odds that he faced getting the Good Friday agreement were
clearly more difficult than the odds we face here.''
</P>
<P>
   The bipartisan retreat, from Friday to Sunday, was a reprise of
a similar gathering here two years ago, but lawmakers conceded that
this one came at an even more difficult moment, on the heels of the
impeachment ordeal.
</P>
<P>
   Their presence here seemed to signal both a genuine desire for
some degree of reconciliation and a genuine concern about their
everyday estrangement from one another.
</P>
<P>
   As they boarded a chartered train leaving Union Station in
Washington on Friday morning and as they took breaks from their
scheduled activities here Friday and Saturday, they spoke ruefully
of the frenetic pace in Congress these days and the impersonal
atmosphere around Washington, where they said fewer and fewer
lawmakers were anchoring their family and social lives.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Jack Quinn, R-N.Y., said between events that there was an
incalculable benefit to ``getting to know someone over a tuna fish
sandwich and a Pepsi instead of a minimum wage agreement.''
</P>
<P>
   But the failure of a majority of House members to come to
Hershey, the self-christened ``sweetest place on earth,''
underlined a feeling among many that all they would get here were
empty calories. Several of them said the event was a futile
charade, more useful for public relations than political harmony.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see the point,'' said Rep. Jim McDermott, D-Wash., who
stayed away. In a telephone interview on the eve of the retreat,
McDermott said that if Republicans were really interested in warmer
relations, they would have been more generous in awarding committee
assignments to Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think in some place in the Bible, it says that by your deeds
you shall be known,'' McDermott said.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week, as the House retreat loomed, some Republican
aides suggested that their party would field about 150 of 200
participants, which prompted Democrats to grumble privately that
Republicans were releasing inflated numbers to make their opponents
look bad. Democrats and even Republican leaders of the retreat
insisted the attendance split was 50-50.
</P>
<P>
   But they declined, even as the train pulled out of Union
Station, to provide a detailed list of participants or even an
overall attendance figure. They simply said the retreat had proved
nearly as potent a draw as it was two years ago, when 197 members
showed up.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The weekend was suffused in secrecy and heavy security, with
reporters relegated to the periphery of the conference center. A
text of Hume's speech was unavailable and details of the schedule
were kept under wraps.
</P>
<P>
   But, this being Congress, there were any number of leaks,
revealing an itinerary rife with items that had an ambiguous
connection to civility and healing.
</P>
<P>
   After a Friday night event at which the actor Sam Waterston
performed his imitation of Abraham Lincoln, early risers could
attend an aerobics workout at 6:45 Saturday morning led by Sandie
Knollenberg, the wife of Rep. Joe Knollenberg, R-Mich.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday afternoon was set aside for diversion and relaxation,
with lawmakers and their families choosing among such options as a
journey to Gettysburg, a trip to the chocolate museum, high tea at
the Hotel Hershey and a skating exhibition known as World on Ice.
That was all leading up to the hoedown, where the kind of
fluorescent necklaces popular at circuses would be scattered around
the tables as festive icebreakers. (Two years ago, it was hula
hoops.)
</P>
<P>
   Organizers said none of this strayed from the retreat's purpose
of fostering greater civility in Congress. A common refrain was
that once a lawmaker had seen a colleague across the aisle changing
a toddler's diaper or had broken bread with someone from the enemy
camp, it would be harder for him or her to summarily demonize the
other side.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe there was something to that. Susan Lampson, who attended
the retreat with her husband, Rep. Nick Lampson, D-Texas, said that
ever since she happened to meet and befriend Rep. Kevin Brady,
R-Texas, and his wife a while ago, ``I've told my husband that
during the next campaign, he can't go out and talk ugly about
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers at the retreat also said Waterston's commentary on the
Civil War and Hume's remarks about the quest for peace in Northern
Ireland had helped them put their own quarrels in perspective, and
even inspired them.
</P>
<P>
   That boded well for a wish that Rep. Joe Crowley, D-N.Y.,
expressed at the start of the event.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope that at the end of this weekend,'' he said with a
smile, ``I can lay a big Hershey's kiss on a Republican, preferably
female.''

   HAITI: AT-A-GLANCE
</P>
<P>
   Population: 7.8 million
</P>
<P>
   Capital: Port-au-Prince, population 2 million
</P>
<P>
   Location: Haiti occupies the western third of the Caribbean
island of Hispaniola, an island it shares with the Dominican
Republic. Haiti is about the size of Maryland, and is located 600
miles southeast of Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Languages: Creole; French
</P>
<P>
   Life expectancy: 54.5 years
</P>
<P>
   Adult Literacy Rate: 40 percent
</P>
<P>
   Currency: the gourde; exchange rate about 17:1
</P>
<P>
   Religion: About 80 percent are Catholic, but voodoo is widely
practiced.
</P>
<P>
   Unemployment/underemployment: 70 percent
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Average annual per-capita income: $225
</P>
<P>
   Fertility rate: 4.8 children per woman
</P>
<P>
   President: Rene Preval
</P>
<P>
   Political situation: Haiti's government has been virtually
paralyzed since June 1997, when then-Prime Minister Rosny Smarth
resigned. Parliament then rejected President Preval's first three
nominees to replace Smarth, creating a crisis that has blocked
government programs and held up nearly $1 billion in international
aid. The crisis came to a head on Jan. 11, when Preval announced
that the terms of most legislators, as well as the mayors, had
ended.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. involvement: Haitians have long been suspicious of the
United States, which occupied Haiti from 1915 to 1934. The United
States funneled millions of dollars to the Duvaliers -- father,
``Papa Doc,'' and son, ``Baby Doc'' -- who ruled Haiti with an iron
fist. During their 30-year reign, which ended in 1986, thousands of
people were massacred or tortured to death. Jean-Bertrand Aristide,
a populist priest, was elected president in 1990, but was removed
by a military coup only nine months after taking office. He spent
three years in exile in the United States. Then, in September 1994,
President Clinton ordered 20,000 troops to Haiti to remove the
military regime and restore Aristide to power.

   Sources: U.S. and Haitian governments.
</P>
<P>
   HAITI TIMELINE: FROM THE DUVALIERS TO U.S. INVASION . . .
</P>
<P>
   1986: The oppressive 30-year dictatorship of the Duvaliers comes
to an end when son, Jean-Claude ``Baby Doc'' Duvalier flees to
France in February.
</P>
<P>
   1987: Gen. Henri Namphy, the head of the interim military
government, promises presidential elections, but they are called
off after Duvalierists massacre at least 34 voters on polling day.
</P>
<P>
   1988: New, but fraudulent elections were held in January and
Professor Leslie Manigat is handed the presidency. He is ousted in
June, however, when he tries to remove Namphy as army commander.
After only four months, Namphy himself is ousted by a coup that
brings Gen. Prosper Avril to power.
</P>
<P>
   1989: Several unsuccessful coup attempts are then staged against
leader Gen. Prosper Avril.
</P>
<P>
   1990: Avril flees the country amid violent protests, and
democratic elections are held. Father Jean-Bertrand Aristide is
elected president.
</P>
<P>
   1991: Aristide is overthrown by the military. He flees to the
the United States, where he heads a Haitian government-in-exile for
three years. The Organization of American States, led by the United
States, imposes a crippling economic embargo.
</P>
<P>
   1992: Haiti is under brutal military dictatorship of Army
commander Gen. Raoul Cedras. In July, Aristide and army sign accord
to return him to power but Cedras and other military leaders fail
to resign.
</P>
<P>
   1993: Further United Nations pressure comes in the form of an
oil embargo. Cedras agrees to the deployment of U.N. human rights
monitors in Haiti.
</P>
<P>
   1994: U.S.-led forces invade Haiti, and restore Aristide to
power.

   U.S. TAXPAYERS: SO MUCH MONEY ... SO LITTLE TO SHOW FOR IT
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  $30 million on election support ... three sets of elections
plagued by fraud and low turnout
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  $30 million on justice reform ... among other things, programs
have provided legal services to 18,710 poor Haitians who didn't
have access before; but the justice system is still weak and mostly
corrupt
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  $400,000 a year on a Special Investigations Unit ... it was
set up to investigate 26 politically-motivated murders but has yet
to crack a case
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  $34 million on agriculture and environment ... millions of
trees planted; more than 140,000 hillside farmers are learning to
produce more tree crops such as coffee, mangos, cocoa and citrus
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  $17 million on education ... 960 teachers trained and books
distributed to a million students
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  $60 million on health ... health services provided to 4.7
million people
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  $5.3 million to sell off nine state-owned enterprises; flour
mill, cement plant, the seaport, airport, phone company, electric
company, water company and two banks. ... only one -- the flour
mill -- has been sold
</P>
<P>
   WHAT CONGRESS IS SAYING:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  U.S. Rep. Porter Goss, R-Fla.: ``There's a trend in Haiti back
toward authoritarian rule. We've been ripped off.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what we've gotten for our money. The justice
system doesn't exist. The roads are falling apart. There's cover-up
and denial on the drug issue. There's so much corruption that the
only way to make sure aid gets to the people is to fly down there
yourself with some food, hand it to a Haitian, and watch him eat it
in your presence.
</P>
<P>
   ``That place is hanging on by a thread. All indicators show the
country is going backwards, not forwards.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Rep. Carrie Meek, D-Fla.: ``I don't think that U.S. policy
toward Haiti should be changed. There has been a political crisis,
but that's to be expected.
</P>
<P>
   ``Political turmoil is no reason to take aid away from the
people. I think some members of Congress would just as soon see
Haiti go away.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Rep. Charles Rangel, D-N.Y.: ``Clinton has shown a lot of
political courage in Haiti.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am very disappointed with the government of Haiti. But we
can't penalize the people just because there are political
problems.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Rep. James E. Clyburn, D-S.C.: ``I'm disappointed more
progress hasn't been made in Haiti. I'm disappointed with the
government of Haiti. We're watching the situation there closely.
One problem is that they have too many political parties in Haiti.
The country's too fragmented.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Sen. Mike DeWine, R-Ohio.: ``Our aid has had success. The
problem is that the success stories haven't been as big as we'd
like.
</P>
<P>
   ``The central government doesn't function. I think the elite in
Haiti hasn't decided that it's in their best interest for the
government to change.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am certainly open to trying to find ways to leverage aid to
get the changes that need to be made in Haiti. I think it's going
to be tougher and tougher to sustain our level of assistance.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  U.S. Rep. Sonny Callahan, R-Ala.: ``If we'd give the
administration total discretion, they'd spend every penny they have
on Haiti.
</P>
<P>
   ``Haiti is not a success story. I chastised Warren Christopher
for calling Haiti a success story. The place is getting worse.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even on President Preval's part, he shows no enthusiasm to
make changes.''
</P>
<P>
   FOLLOWING THE FLOW OF AID MONEY, FROM U.S. TAXPAYERS TO HAITI
POOR . . .
</P>
<P>
   According to USAID, here's how an aid program gets funded:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The idea for a program, like feeding the hungry, is hatched by
the USAID office in Haiti.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The program, including the budget, is sent to USAID in
Washington and also to the State Department.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Both have to review it.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Then it is sent to the White House for its review.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The White House makes changes and sends it back to USAID in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Then it goes to Capitol Hill. USAID makes a presentation
before Congress. Then Congress decides whether or not to
appropriate the money.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Then the final plan and budget goes back to State Department
for one more review, and then back to USAID in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Then the money is sent to USAID in Haiti.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  They give money to one of 30 non-governmental organizations
which will then implement the program. For example, with food aid,
much of the money would go to Atlanta-based C.A.R.E.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  C.A.R.E. would in turn set up a feeding center at a school,
for example.

 &HT;    HAITIANS STILL RILED AT U.S. OVER NOTORIOUS PIG PROGRAM
 &HT;    With HAITI-FAILURE-$ADV21.

<P>
   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti _ For the life of Remy Felix, he just
can't shake the so-called ``pig story.''
</P>
<P>
   Like many other poor Haitians, Felix -- who lives in the
sprawling slum of Cite Soleil --still bitterly recalls how the
United States, alarmed by an outbreak of African swine fever in the
early 1980s, persuaded the Haitian government to slaughter every
pig in the country.
</P>
<P>
   Felix said the resulting economic fiasco did little to endear
the United States to many Haitian farmers. Sadly, it is also
indicative of how the U.S. Agency for International Development
(USAID), which administers foreign aid programs for the U.S. State
Department, has sometimes miscalculated here.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those people tried to destroy Haiti,'' Felix said angrily. ``I
remember my family suffering much.''
</P>
<P>
   The story goes like this: Nearly 20 years ago, Haiti officials
had between 300,000 and 400,000 pigs destroyed after U.S.
scientists detected swine fever in Haitian black Creole pigs. By
th late 1970s, hundreds of thousands had already died of swine
fever -- a fatal and highly contagious disease that causes internal
hemorrhaging in the animals -- and fears erupted that it might
spread throughout the hemisphere.
</P>
<P>
   By 1984, after the U.S.-supported slaughter, the country was
declared free of the fever. That is when USAID implemented a
controversial plan to spend $5.8 million to replace the black pigs
with white pigs from the United States.
</P>
<P>
   USAID officials argued that the pigs would grow larger, and that
their meat could be exported. What's more, farmers were generally
reimbursed for their loss when a pig was slaughtered and should
look at the new imports as an opportunity to boost their income.
</P>
<P>
   It sounded feasible, and even desirable. Traditionally, pigs had
been an important economic mainstay here. So much so that Haitians
used the same word for both ``pig'' and ``bank.''
</P>
<P>
   But when the new American pigs were shipped in, the farmers
found that they needed a wheat-based, vitamin-enriched feed that
farmers could ill-afford. Also, many of the pigs couldn't survive
the heat. As a result, many of the farmers suffered major economic
losses.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, the Haitian government had to import the tougher,
better-adaptable black pigs from Jamaica and other parts of the
Caribbean to replace the depleted population.
</P>
<P>
   ``Haitians politicized this issue, saying we were trying to kill
all their pigs, but actually the farmers were paid quite well,''
said Ernest Preeg, U.S. ambassador to Haiti from 1981 to 1983.
</P>
<P>
   As for the American ``bourgeois pigs,'' as the Haitians called
them, the farmers did get some use out of them. They often served
them up as dinner.

<P>
   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti _ Five years from now, U.S. aid officials
envision a very different Haiti.
</P>
<P>
   It is a place where elections draw a majority of voters, and the
average woman bears only four children. A place where mayors
provide garbage pick-up, and tourists swarm seaside cities.
</P>
<P>
   They've had these kinds of visions before, however. Five years
go, in fact.
</P>
<P>
   But a U.S. led invasion and a massive infusion of non-military
aid later -- $669 million from the United States alone -- and
unyielding hopes have slammed up against an unshakable reality:
International assistance is no substitute for the Haitian
government's will to reform.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, some key members of Congress are saying -- in
louder and louder voices -- that it is time for the United States
to rethink an aid policy that hasn't always accomplished its goals.
</P>
<P>
   For Clinton administration officials, there is an added sense of
urgency in that the number of Haitian boat people coming to the
United States is steadily increasing. The White House is seeking
another $105 million in aid money for Haiti this year.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at the U.S. Agency for International Development, the
State Department's foreign aid arm, also know they have reached a
critical juncture.
</P>
<P>
   Either show more results, or Congress is likely to get its way
-- sharply reducing aid and exacerbating an already miserable
situation.
</P>
<P>
   USAID officials insist that a new five-year plan will help make
this poor Caribbean country an exemplar of economic prosperity and
democratic institutions.
</P>
<P>
   There is no shortage of ideas from outside the administration,
as well:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Putting more money into rural areas, and farming programs;
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Training seminars on how to resolve differences -- peacefully;
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  And expanding U.S. trade with Haiti.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps no scheme will work. But aid officials agree they must
keep trying.
</P>
<P>
   Said Tom Friedeberg, director here for C.A.R.E., the
Atlanta-based relief organization: ``I am disappointed we haven't
made more progress . . . but if we pulled out now, it would be a
disaster for the country,''
</P>
<P>
   A microcosm of the future can be glimpsed inside a third-grade
classroom at the Immaculate Conception School, an all-girls' school
of about 500 students.
</P>
<P>
   Here, all eyes are fixed on a radio that's prominently displayed
on the teacher's desk.
</P>
<P>
   From that radio, the day's lesson is broadcast.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you have two baskets, and there are five avocados in each
one, then how many avocados do you have?'' asks the voice on the
radio.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ten,'' the students shout in unison. Their teacher nods her
head in approval.
</P>
<P>
   Although a fifth of the class is absent, the 40 or so students
present -- all neatly dressed in blue socks and blue dresses --
seem genuinely enthusiastic about their studies.
</P>
<P>
   USAID officials hope they stay that way.
</P>
<P>
   After spending nearly $20 million to train teachers in a country
where some educators can barely read and write, officials now plan
to spend nearly $20 million more on this form of distance education
known as interactive radio instruction, which allows a radio to
deliver lessons designed by Haiti's best teachers.
</P>
<P>
   Already, 6,200 third-graders in 118 schools are being reached.
</P>
<P>
   The idea is to improve the quality of education while increasing
attendance at schools in a country where only half of all children
aged 6 years to 12 years attend classes.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we're doing is moving away from emergency assistance and
focusing more on programs that can have a long-term impact on
Haiti,'' said Mark Schneider, USAID's assistant director for Latin
America and the Caribbean.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly education is an area that can have a real long-term
impact,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   That's a different approach from the one taken five years ago,
when aid officials were confronted with the challenges of
rebuilding from scratch the hemisphere's poorest nation, where
everything from jobs to clean water was absent.
</P>
<P>
   Then, they set up 2,500 feeding centers and started a short-term
jobs program. They trained a police force to defend citizens rather
than oppress them.
</P>
<P>
   While those efforts will continue, USAID officials will focus
more over the next five years on working directly with local
governments provide services Americans take for granted, such as
garbage pick-up.
</P>
<P>
   USAID also plans to help develop Haiti's tourism industry,
particularly in the picturesque seaside town of Jacmel, located
just 55 miles southwest of Port-au-Prince.
</P>
<P>
   For example, a $1.3 million project to restore Jacmel's wharf
will allow docking for cruise ships bringing up to 2,000 visitors a
day.
</P>
<P>
   For critics of USAID's programs, though, the focus should also
turn to Haiti's long-overlooked countryside.
</P>
<P>
   USAID spends 15 percent of its money on agricultural programs in
rural areas, although two-thirds of the population lives outside
the big cities.
</P>
<P>
   The lack of spending in rural areas -- where three million
people subsist on less than $160 a year -- has caused residents to
migrate, swelling already overcrowded cities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rural areas must be brought more fully into aid programs since
this is where most people live and work,'' said Rachel Neild, a
Haiti expert at the Washington Office on Latin America.
</P>
<P>
   But the challenge of rural development is an intimidating one
because half of Haiti's land is on inclined slopes, rendering
mechanical farming difficult, if not impossible.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Neild says these harsh conditions argue strongly for a
strategy of development in rural areas, if only to keep poverty
from getting any worse.
</P>
<P>
   Others argue that farmers should be encouraged to grow food for
their own tables, rather than products for export -- such as
gourmet coffee -- as has been the focus of many USAID programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``While we have nothing against exports, helping people grow
food for themselves and for the local market is the real way to
foment long-term development,'' said Kevin Murray, executive
director of Grassroots International, a Boston, Mass.-based
independent aid organization.
</P>
<P>
   He said more farm loans and training programs could spark
small-scale agriculture.
</P>
<P>
   Some, also take issue with the roughly $30 million that has been
spent on justice reform without giving consideration to human
rights or conflict resolution -- a must in a society as fragmented
as Haiti's.
</P>
<P>
   Even representatives of the Haitian government say justice
programs should be oriented to ensuring that military officers
responsible for human rights abuses during the coup of 1991 against
President Jean-Bertrand Aristide are brought to trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``This would bring the population together and give people some
real confidence in the justice system, which they don't have now,''
said Ira Kurzban, the Haitian government's Miami-based legal
adviser.
</P>
<P>
   Haitians say more seminars on training their politicians to
resolve differences must be organized.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Haiti, everyone always has to win,'' said Micha Gaillard, a
leader of the socialist National Congress of Democratic Movements
in Haiti.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't know how to compromise or how to play the game of
give and take with one another, and that's created political
problems which have really hurt this country,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps it is the trade battle is brewing in the U.S.
Congress that could have the biggest long-term impact on Haiti's
future development -- and go along way toward reducing dependence
on foreign aid.
</P>
<P>
   More than half the Haitian government's budget now comes from
foreign aid.
</P>
<P>
   Various proposals have been introduced in recent months that
would, if passed, expand the Caribbean Basin Initiative, or CBI,
granting exporters from the Caribbean the same preferential
treatment enjoyed by Mexico under the North American Free Trade
Agreement, or NAFTA.
</P>
<P>
   For years, Caribbean countries, including Haiti, have argued
that they can't compete with Mexico for foreign investment --
particularly in assembly industries -- which their economies need
to reduce unemployment.
</P>
<P>
   Unemployment in Haiti tops 70 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``The United States shouldn't maintain trade barriers against
the poor,'' said Merrill Smith, director of Haiti Advocacy Inc., a
Washington, D.C.-based lobbying group.
</P>
<P>
   But even USAID officials admit privately that economic growth
here will have to average 8 percent to 10 percent -- for several
years in a row -- before real widespread development can occur.
</P>
<P>
   Still, few seem willing to give up on Haiti.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to continue to show great concern over Haiti,'' said
Sen. Mike DeWine, R-Ohio. ``The place is in our own backyard.''

<P>
   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti _ Painfully shy, Maderges Vincent is the
type of child who greets strangers by running to hide.
</P>
<P>
   From a distance, the nine-year-old is so bright, energetic and
giggly with girlfriends she's usually able to fool the casual
observer. But only for a little while.
</P>
<P>
   Then it becomes apparent. She has no arms.
</P>
<P>
   Born here, in the hemisphere's poorest country, where many
handicapped children are effectively written off at birth, Maderges
was abandoned by her parents when she was a mere three months old.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately for her, she was deposited on the front stoop of the
Ecole Saint Vincent Pour Enfants Handicapes, creole for St.
Vincent's School for Handicapped Children.
</P>
<P>
   It's the only place in Haiti designed to care for disabled young
people, be they blind, deaf or, like Maderges, missing limbs.
</P>
<P>
   Founded in 1945 by the Episcopal church, St. Vincent's receives
little money from either the Haitian or American governments.
Rather almost all of the center's money comes from private
donations, mostly from the United States. Its success is proof of
what can be accomplished in Haiti when individuals take matters
into their own hands.
</P>
<P>
   With a relatively meager budget, St. Vincent's has a staff of
130 -- including scores of volunteer doctors and teachers from the
United States, Haiti, and Canada -- that serve nearly 400 kids that
attend the school. About 248 children live there.
</P>
<P>
   About 40 percent are blind. Another 20 percent are deaf. Many of
the rest are missing limbs.
</P>
<P>
   It houses Haiti's only shop for the design and manufacture of
prosthetics, which is staffed by deaf workers, and fashions some
15-20 plastic arms and legs a month -- which helps support the
school.
</P>
<P>
   Little Maderges seems to get along just fine without such
things.
</P>
<P>
   At lunchtime, the dexterous child props her feet up on the
table, just like she would elbows. She gestures with her feet when
she talks. She eats with a fork that dangles, incongruously,
between her toes. She also uses her feet to write and brush her
teeth.
</P>
<P>
   When she's bored, she rests her chin on the bottom of her foot
as if it were the palm of her hand.
</P>
<P>
   Her lack of arms would seem to be an almost-paralyzing
challenge, yet she seems strangely competent.
</P>
<P>
   Best of all, she has friends who understand her disability
because they, too, are disabled.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maderges has no parents, so we're her family now and we've
taken good care of her, because who else was going to do it?'' said
Frantz Casseus(CQ), the school's director.
</P>
<P>
   ``We teach these children to eat by themselves and dress by
themselves,'' he said. ``We stress that they can live normal lives
despite their disabilities.''
</P>
<P>
   By stressing self-reliance, the center gets results in a country
where almost nothing else seems to work.
</P>
<P>
   Here, there is no money for ``social services,'' and prejudice
against the physically disabled runs rampant -- so much so that the
handicapped are generally left to fend for themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``People in Haiti are so poor, and they have their own
overwhelming problems to deal with, so they don't have a lot of
time or compassion for handicapped people,'' said Joseph Jean Paul,
40, who helps care for the children at the center.
</P>
<P>
   Born with no limbs, he came to live at the center when he was
three.
</P>
<P>
   St. Vincent's is located in the middle of a noisy downtown
street just a short walk from Haitian President Rene Preval's
gleaming white palace.
</P>
<P>
   The three-story motel-like structure is a nondescript one, built
around a tiny pool that hasn't seen water in three years and a
concrete play area where only a metal teeter-totter sits rusting.
</P>
<P>
   Electricity is available for only four to six hours a day. The
dormitory rooms are lined with simple bunk beds, and contain few
toys or decorations. The physical therapy room is equally sparse,
although volunteers make due exercising the students with giant
rubber balls and old metal tricycles.
</P>
<P>
   What the center lacks in material resources, however, it makes
up for in spirit.
</P>
<P>
   A cacophony of music swells in the air daily here, as learning
to play a musical instrument is perhaps the biggest part of a
child's education here.
</P>
<P>
   In one dimly lit room, a group of blind children sitting around
a table can be heard practicing ``Top of the World,'' by The
Carpenters on handbells, accompanied by an out-of-tune piano. In
another, St. Vincent's 30-member orchestra may be tuning up for
practice, in preparation for a planned fund-raising concert in the
United States next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The music gives these kids real confidence in themselves,''
Casseus said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year we did our first concert here in Haiti and people
were stunned,'' he added. ``They had no idea handicapped children
could perform so beautifully.''

</P>
<P>
   Population: 7.8 million

</P>
<P>
   Political situation: Haiti's government has been virtually
paralyzed since June 1997, when then-Prime Minister Rosny Smarth
resigned. Parliament then rejected President Preval's first three
nominees to replace Smarth, creating a crisis that has blocked
government programs and held up nearly $1 billion in international
aid. The crisis came to a head on Jan. 11, when Preval announced
that the terms of most legislators, as well as the mayors, had
ended.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. involvement: Haitians have long been suspicious of the
United States, which occupied Haiti from 1915 to 1934. The United
States funneled millions of dollars to the Duvaliers -- father,
``Papa Doc,'' and son, ``Baby Doc'' -- who ruled Haiti with an iron
fist. During their 30-year reign, which ended in 1986, thousands of
people were massacred or tortured to death. Jean-Bertrand Aristide,
a populist priest, was elected president in 1990, but was removed
by a military coup only nine months after taking office. He spent
three years in exile in the United States. Then, in September 1994,
President Clinton ordered 20,000 troops to Haiti to remove the
military regime and restore Aristide to power.

</P>
<P>
   HAITI TIMELINE: FROM THE DUVALIERS TO U.S. INVASION . . .
</P>
<P>
   1986: The oppressive 30-year dictatorship of the Duvaliers comes
to an end when son, Jean-Claude ``Baby Doc'' Duvalier flees to
France in February.
</P>
<P>
   1987: Gen. Henri Namphy, the head of the interim military
government, promises presidential elections, but they are called
off after Duvalierists massacre at least 34 voters on polling day.
</P>
<P>
   1988: New, but fraudulent elections were held in January and
Professor Leslie Manigat is handed the presidency. He is ousted in
June, however, when he tries to remove Namphy as army commander.
After only four months, Namphy himself is ousted by a coup that
brings Gen. Prosper Avril to power.
</P>
<P>
   1989: Several unsuccessful coup attempts are then staged against
leader Gen. Prosper Avril.
</P>
<P>
   1990: Avril flees the country amid violent protests, and
democratic elections are held. Father Jean-Bertrand Aristide is
elected president.
</P>
<P>
   1991: Aristide is overthrown by the military. He flees to the
the United States, where he heads a Haitian government-in-exile for
three years. The Organization of American States, led by the United
States, imposes a crippling economic embargo.
</P>
<P>
   1992: Haiti is under brutal military dictatorship of Army
commander Gen. Raoul Cedras. In July, Aristide and army sign accord
to return him to power but Cedras and other military leaders fail
to resign.
</P>
<P>
   1993: Further United Nations pressure comes in the form of an
oil embargo. Cedras agrees to the deployment of U.N. human rights
monitors in Haiti.
</P>
<P>
   1994: U.S.-led forces invade Haiti, and restore Aristide to
power.

   U.S. TAXPAYERS: SO MUCH MONEY ... SO LITTLE TO SHOW FOR IT
</P>
<P>

plagued by fraud and low turnout
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  $30 million on justice reform ... among other things, programs
have provided legal services to 18,710 poor Haitians who didn't
have access before; but the justice system is still weak and mostly
corrupt

set up to investigate 26 politically-motivated murders but has yet
to crack a case

<P>
   WHAT CONGRESS IS SAYING:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  U.S. Rep. Porter Goss, R-Fla.: ``There's a trend in Haiti back
toward authoritarian rule. We've been ripped off.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what we've gotten for our money. The justice
system doesn't exist. The roads are falling apart. There's cover-up
and denial on the drug issue. There's so much corruption that the
only way to make sure aid gets to the people is to fly down there
yourself with some food, hand it to a Haitian, and watch him eat it
in your presence.
</P>
<P>
   ``That place is hanging on by a thread. All indicators show the
country is going backwards, not forwards.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Rep. Carrie Meek, D-Fla.: ``I don't think that U.S. policy
toward Haiti should be changed. There has been a political crisis,
but that's to be expected.
</P>
<P>
   ``Political turmoil is no reason to take aid away from the
people. I think some members of Congress would just as soon see
Haiti go away.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Rep. Charles Rangel, D-N.Y.: ``Clinton has shown a lot of
political courage in Haiti.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am very disappointed with the government of Haiti. But we
can't penalize the people just because there are political
problems.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Rep. James E. Clyburn, D-S.C.: ``I'm disappointed more
progress hasn't been made in Haiti. I'm disappointed with the
government of Haiti. We're watching the situation there closely.
One problem is that they have too many political parties in Haiti.
The country's too fragmented.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Sen. Mike DeWine, R-Ohio.: ``Our aid has had success. The
problem is that the success stories haven't been as big as we'd
like.
</P>
<P>
   ``The central government doesn't function. I think the elite in
Haiti hasn't decided that it's in their best interest for the
government to change.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am certainly open to trying to find ways to leverage aid to
get the changes that need to be made in Haiti. I think it's going
to be tougher and tougher to sustain our level of assistance.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  U.S. Rep. Sonny Callahan, R-Ala.: ``If we'd give the
administration total discretion, they'd spend every penny they have
on Haiti.
</P>
<P>
   ``Haiti is not a success story. I chastised Warren Christopher
for calling Haiti a success story. The place is getting worse.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even on President Preval's part, he shows no enthusiasm to
make changes.''
</P>
<P>
   FOLLOWING THE FLOW OF AID MONEY, FROM U.S. TAXPAYERS TO HAITI
POOR . . .
</P>
<P>
   According to USAID, here's how an aid program gets funded:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The idea for a program, like feeding the hungry, is hatched by
the USAID office in Haiti.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The program, including the budget, is sent to USAID in
Washington and also to the State Department.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Both have to review it.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Then it is sent to the White House for its review.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The White House makes changes and sends it back to USAID in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Then it goes to Capitol Hill. USAID makes a presentation
before Congress. Then Congress decides whether or not to
appropriate the money.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Then the final plan and budget goes back to State Department
for one more review, and then back to USAID in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Then the money is sent to USAID in Haiti.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  They give money to one of 30 non-governmental organizations
which will then implement the program. For example, with food aid,
much of the money would go to Atlanta-based C.A.R.E.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  C.A.R.E. would in turn set up a feeding center at a school,
for example.

<P>
   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti _ In the fall of 1994, President Clinton
confounded his critics by successfully using 20,000 U.S.-led forces
to overthrow a brutal military regime here and give democracy a
second chance.
</P>
<P>
   Almost no blood was shed. A triumph in foreign policy was
declared.
</P>
<P>
   But today, after nearly five years of pouring more than $2.2
billion of American taxpayers' money into Haiti, there is little to
feel triumphant about.
</P>
<P>
   The daily killings have indeed ceased. But instead of bringing
lasting democracy and economic development to this poor Caribbean
nation, impatient members of Congress -- and even some Haiti
experts within the administration -- say the United States is on
the brink of a foreign policy disaster.
</P>
<P>
   ``It could slip back to chaos (at any moment), and that is a
great concern,'' said one State Department official who spoke on
condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   A foreboding came in January when Haitian President Rene Preval
dissolved the parliament, effectively implementing one-man rule.
Preceding government gridlock over much-needed economic reforms had
already frozen nearly $1 billion in aid pledged by international
financial institutions -- partly underwritten by the United States
-- that might have resulted in real progress toward systemic
development.
</P>
<P>
   An analysis of the Clinton administration's aid program here by
Cox Newspapers showed instead that despite U.S. efforts roads are
crumbling, electricity and clean water are scarce, and many
children still go hungry as per-capita income has fallen from $260
in 1994 to $225 today.
</P>
<P>
   The analysis, which also included World Bank and Inter-American
Development Bank (IADB) documents, showed some successes. But they
also revealed glaring weaknesses in a sometimes-misguided policy.
In some cases, it appears that money was simply misdirected.
</P>
<P>
   For example, no money disbursed by the U.S. Agency for
International Development (USAID) here has been spent on adult
literacy, although two-thirds of Haitian adults can't read or
write. In addition, USAID has only spent 15 percent of aid money on
agricultural programs when two-thirds of the people live off the
land in rural areas.
</P>
<P>
   Yet nearly $30 million has been spent to support a panoply of
elections marred by fraud, inefficiency and low voter turnout.
Another nearly $30 million has been spent on reforming a justice
system the U.S. State Department recently called ``nearly
moribund.''
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, the United States gives billions more in total aid
to Russia and more per capita to Israel, but critics find the
Clinton administration's inability to show much for taxpayers'
money in Haiti is particularly grating given that Haiti offers so
comparatively little by way of economic or security benefits.
</P>
<P>
   What Haiti does have, if things fall apart there, is nearly 8
million potential refugees sitting 600 miles off the South Florida
coast. It is this potential nightmare -- and the numbers have
increased sharply over the past year -- that keeps U.S. foreign
policymakers awake at night.
</P>
<P>
   Enough so, that the administration is attempting to obtain
another $105 million for Haiti this year. That has drawn the
attention of critics like U.S. Rep. Porter Goss, R-Fla., who
introduced a resolution earlier this month calling for the
Organization of American States to consider actions to bring about
a return to democracy in Haiti.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been ripped off in Haiti and I don't see why we should
put any more money into it,'' said Goss, who chairs the House
Intelligence Committee. ``There's so much corruption that the only
way to make sure aid gets to the people is to fly down there
yourself with some food, hand it to a Haitian, and watch him eat it
in your presence.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Haiti's people stagger on.
</P>
<P>
   In the seaside slum of Cite Soleil, a 2 1/2-square-mile tin
encampment that houses 200,000 of this city's poorest, citizens say
they're fed up with democracy and long for the days of
dictatorship.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were jobs when (Jean Claude) Duvalier was around . . .
there were even tourists in this country, can you believe that?''
says Alexi Charles, 38, grousing that everything is worse.
</P>
<P>
   Even when U.S. programs have been well-designed, efforts are
often stymied by a paralyzed Haitian government.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe both the Haitian government and the Haitian private
sector are corrupt,'' said Michael Azefor(CQ), the World Bank
representative here, in a recent interview with the Cox News
Service.
</P>
<P>
   He said the World Bank, which recently suspended about half of a
$50 million loan to Haiti for road construction because officials
failed to report how they used the money, has determined that it is
no longer ``responsible'' to negotiate new projects with Haiti.
</P>
<P>
   USAID has reduced the amount of money it funnels through the
Haitian central government to 10 percent, choosing instead to work
with 30 non-governmental organizations -- much as it did in the
days of dictatorship.
</P>
<P>
   But USAID officials warn that development can't be expected to
occur overnight in a country trying to recover from nearly two
centuries of oppressive rule capped by a three-year economic
embargo imposed in the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Hopes couldn't have been higher in 1994 when Haiti won the
equivalent of the international lottery for foreign aid. After the
U.S. invasion, donors from all corners of the globe pledged $3.5
billion to help prop up this embryonic democracy.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the country still ekes along largely on foreign support,
with aid accounting for a whopping 37.3 percent of the gross
domestic product, or GDP.
</P>
<P>
   The United States alone, has spent some $750 million in
non-military aid since 1994 trying to meet the basic needs of
Haiti's poor by planting trees, renovating clinics and distributing
food to hundreds of thousands of Haitians a day. Another $22
million or so a year has gone to maintain a U.S. ``support team''
here of nearly 500 troops.
</P>
<P>
   The commander of U.S. forces in Latin America and the Caribbean
recommended last month the withdrawal of American troops from
Haiti, saying the country's growing political turmoil is placing
them in danger. But State Department officials have vowed to keep
troops in Haiti.
</P>
<P>
   From the start, it appears that donors, including the United
States, may have miscalculated in pressuring the Haitian government
to adopt economic reforms designed to jumpstart the economy.
</P>
<P>
   For example, USAID spent $5.3 million to help Haiti sell off
nine state-owned enterprises -- only one has been sold.
</P>
<P>
   According to a confidential World Bank study, the pressure
divided a pro-reform president and an anti-reform parliament that
is behind much of today's current gridlock.
</P>
<P>
   Still, USAID officials point to a laundry list of achievements
while helping to build a country from scratch, most notably more
credit for small businesses and less malnutrition.
</P>
<P>
   It not only feeds 500,000 school children a day, but has spent
$7.3 million on a project to improve Haiti's coffee bean crop and
market it to U.S. roasters. About 20,000 farmers participate, and
they enthusiastically report that their incomes have increased
four-fold.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our aid is having specific, measurable results,'' said Mark
Schneider, USAID's assistant director for Latin America and the
Caribbean.
</P>
<P>
   But a close look at USAID programs in Haiti reveals at best, a
mixed bag of results.
</P>
<P>
   For example, USAID has supported three sets of elections, all
fraught with fraud and waste -- from inadequate attempts to
register voters to $600,000 paid to an AFL-CIO affiliate for
pollwatching and other duties that were apparently never performed.
The affiliate responded in a Government Accounting Office report,
however, that it did help register 800,000 people to vote.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Pastor, who, at the time, was director of Latin American
and Caribbean Programs at the Carter Center in Atlanta, observed
the June 1995 elections -- the first following the invasion.
</P>
<P>
   Pastor, who's observed 20 elections, called them the worst he'd
ever seen. ``I observed more instances of fraud in that election
than I had ever seen before,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Karen Seiger of the Washington, D.C.-based International
Foundation for Election Systems (IFES), which USAID hired for
election-related support, blamed the election's troubles on the
Haitian government's own inexperience at overseeing elections.
</P>
<P>
   Even Haiti's most recent election, in April 1997, attracted a
derisory 5 percent of the electorate and was never validated due to
charges of fraud.
</P>
<P>
   The attempts at justice reform have not fared much better.
</P>
<P>
   USAID officials say they've provided education for more than
34,000 Haitians, making them more aware of their rights in the
judicial system.
</P>
<P>
   But a report by Creative Associates International Inc., a
consulting firm hired by USAID to evaluate the justice program,
said that ``even with long-term donor support, it is not likely
that a well-functioning judiciary will ever be built on such a weak
foundation.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, one of the justice system's biggest problems is one
USAID can do little about. Haiti's judges are woefully underpaid
and many of them don't show up for work. They resent U.S. attention
showered on the police force, and the relationship between judges
and police is notoriously poor.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Optional trim begins.)
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, among it greatest successes, U.S. officials count
the training of the Haitian National Police force -- even though it
still falls short, both numerically and professionally, of being
able to effectively police the country.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1994, the United States has helped disband the military
and quickly train more than 6,600 police officers at a cost of some
$95 million.
</P>
<P>
   According to the State Department, the police have been a
stabilizing force -- and admirably a neutral one -- although it
still grapples with corruption and human rights abuses.
</P>
<P>
   The force today totals about 5,500, compared with nearly 40,000
police officers in New York City which has a population of roughly
the same size -- about 8 million. Hundreds of police officers have
been dismissed for various reasons, including drug trafficking,
according to U.S. officials. It has no forensics laboratory, which
has sorely curtailed efforts conduct investigations.
</P>
<P>
   The United States also spends $400,000 a year to support a
Special Investigations Unit, a 28-member team of Haitians working
under the direction of an American adviser. The team was formed in
1995 to investigate 26 high-profile, politically motivated murders
that had drawn the attention of Republicans in the U.S. Congress.
</P>
<P>
   It has yet to crack a case.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Optional trim ends).
</P>
<P>
   At the crux of all of these problems, according to aid
officials, is a Haitian government that has been crippled since
June 1997, when the last prime minister resigned.
</P>
<P>
   Haitian President Preval's announcement in January -- citing a
1995 electoral law --that the terms of most legislators and mayors
had ended has sparked fears of a return to dictatorship. Preval's
decision threw into question $6.5 million in aid allocated to
support Haiti's fledgling local governments since 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Preval says he intends to organize quick elections to resolve
the crisis. But the gridlock is keeping Haiti from using about $200
million sitting in a Washington, D.C. bank account, said Ericq
Pierre(CQ), who represents Haiti at the IADB, which promotes
development in Latin America and the Caribbean.
</P>
<P>
   In all, he said Haiti's lost out on nearly $600 million from the
IADB alone.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Clinton administration has budgeted $105 million
for Haiti this year, despite a November internal memo by James
Dobbins, the top Latin America and Caribbean specialist on the
National Security Council staff, acknowledging that the poor
situation in Haiti ``has (unfortunately) not changed in any
significant way'' over the past year.
</P>
<P>
   Add to that a growing chorus of criticism from members of
Congress convinced U.S. resources have been squandered.
</P>
<P>
   They include Republican North Carolina Sen. Jesse Helms, the
powerful chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. A
letter from Helms to Secretary of State Madeleine Albright halted a
U.S.-funded program in Haiti last month that used voodoo ceremonies
to promote contraceptive use.
</P>
<P>
   ``The big failure's been the lack of political will inside Haiti
to do the things that need doing,'' said Sen. Mike DeWine, R-Ohio,
who co-signed Rep. Goss' resolution denouncing the Haitian
government. ``We simply haven't been able to have the impact on
Haiti we would have liked.''
</P>
<P>
   A major complaint is that the money's failed to buy the U.S.
government a lot of influence.
</P>
<P>
   Even a parade of high-level emissaries to Haiti that include
Albright and First lady Hillary Rodham Clinton have not been able
to break the political impasse here.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're funding a huge part of the government's budget, and
you still don't have any leverage, how do you explain that?'' the
Carter Center's Pastor asked.
</P>
<P>
   With about 20 percent of all U.S. foreign aid for Latin America
and the Caribbean going to this country with less than 2 percent of
the region's population, a lot of congressmen -- especially
Republicans -- are asking the same question.
</P>
<P>
   Goss, House International Relations Committee chairman Benjamin
Gilman and others say U.S. policy toward Haiti should be completely
re-evaluated.
</P>
<P>
   But for Republicans, who opposed the deployment of troops here,
aid to Haiti has never been popular.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think some members of Congress would just as soon see Haiti
go away,'' said Rep. Carrie Meek, D-Fla. ``But I don't think that
U.S. policy toward Haiti should be changed. There has been a
political crisis ... (but) political turmoil is no reason to take
aid away from the people.''
</P>
<P>
   USAID's Schneider said aid must continue not only for reasons of
compassion, but to keep U.S.-bound Haitians from fleeing the
country.
</P>
<P>
   A flood of Haitian boat people that reached nearly 25,000 in
1994 has been reduced to a mere trickle, albeit one that threatens
to grow as the situation here appears all the more hopeless.
</P>
<P>
   And because the United States has no repatriation agreement with
Haiti, as it does with Cuba, it cannot automatically send back
Haitians intercepted in international waters.
</P>
<P>
   What happens next in Haiti is the great unknown.
</P>
<P>
   For the time being, however, one State Department official may
have summed it up best: ``Haiti has cost a lot and it will cost a
lot and it will continue to cost a lot for a very long time.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti _ For the life of Remy Felix, he just
can't shake the so-called ``pig story.''
</P>
<P>
   Like many other poor Haitians, Felix -- who lives in the
sprawling slum of Cite Soleil --still bitterly recalls how the
United States, alarmed by an outbreak of African swine fever in the
early 1980s, persuaded the Haitian government to slaughter every
pig in the country.
</P>
<P>
   Felix said the resulting economic fiasco did little to endear
the United States to many Haitian farmers. Sadly, it is also
indicative of how the U.S. Agency for International Development
(USAID), which administers foreign aid programs for the U.S. State
Department, has sometimes miscalculated here.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those people tried to destroy Haiti,'' Felix said angrily. ``I
remember my family suffering much.''
</P>
<P>
   The story goes like this: Nearly 20 years ago, Haiti officials
had between 300,000 and 400,000 pigs destroyed after U.S.
scientists detected swine fever in Haitian black Creole pigs. By
the late 1970s, hundreds of thousands had already died of swine
fever -- a fatal and highly contagious disease that causes internal
hemorrhaging in the animals -- and fears erupted that it might
spread throughout the hemisphere.
</P>
<P>
   By 1984, after the U.S.-supported slaughter, the country was
declared free of the fever. That is when USAID implemented a
controversial plan to spend $5.8 million to replace the black pigs
with white pigs from the United States.
</P>
<P>
   USAID officials argued that the pigs would grow larger, and that
their meat could be exported. What's more, farmers were generally
reimbursed for their loss when a pig was slaughtered and should
look at the new imports as an opportunity to boost their income.
</P>
<P>
   It sounded feasible, and even desirable. Traditionally, pigs had
been an important economic mainstay here. So much so that Haitians
used the same word for both ``pig'' and ``bank.''
</P>
<P>
   But when the new American pigs were shipped in, the farmers
found that they needed a wheat-based, vitamin-enriched feed that
farmers could ill-afford. Also, many of the pigs couldn't survive
the heat. As a result, many of the farmers suffered major economic
losses.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, the Haitian government had to import the tougher,
better-adaptable black pigs from Jamaica and other parts of the
Caribbean to replace the depleted population.
</P>
<P>
   ``Haitians politicized this issue, saying we were trying to kill
all their pigs, but actually the farmers were paid quite well,''
said Ernest Preeg, U.S. ambassador to Haiti from 1981 to 1983.
</P>
<P>
   As for the American ``bourgeois pigs,'' as the Haitians called
them, the farmers did get some use out of them. They often served
them up as dinner.

 &HT;    CLINTON: SERBS HAVE CROSSED 'THRESHOLD,' WARNS OF 'RISKS' WITH
NATO STRIKES
 &HT;    EDs: With optional trim.
 &HT;    Moving in both the International and Washington categories.
 &HT;    By BOB DEANS 
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Serbs in Kosovo have already crossed the
''threshold'' that would trigger NATO air strikes, President
Clinton said Friday, warning that the alliance is united and poised
to attack to prevent further civilian deaths and a widening Balkan
conflict.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton stressed, however, that Serbs may still avoid military
action by agreeing to a U.S.-brokered peace plan that would place
28,000 NATO peacekeepers in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not want to put a single American pilot into the air. I
do not want anyone else to die in the Balkans. I do not want a
conflict,'' Clinton told reporters at a White House news
conference.
</P>
<P>
   But, said Clinton, with some 40,000 Serb troops and police
backed by hundreds of tanks already massing in or near Kosovo, NATO
has all the justification it needs to strike. The alliance will not
wait for further atrocities to be committed before it acts to avert
a widening humanitarian disaster there, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that whatever threshold they need to cross has been
crossed,'' said Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have massed their troops, they have continued to take
aggressive action, they have already leveled one village in the
recent past and killed a lot of innocent people,'' Clinton said.
``I do not believe that we ought to have to have thousands more
people slaughtered and buried in open soccer fields before we do
something.''
</P>
<P>
   Preparing the nation for possible casualties, Clinton conceded
that American pilots could face formidable Serb defenses and a
hostile environment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unquestionably, there are risks in military action, if that
becomes necessary,'' Clinton said. ``U.S. and other NATO pilots
will be in harm's way. The Serbs have a strong air-defense
system.''
</P>
<P>
   Those threats, Clinton said, must be weighed against the risks
of inaction in a region that has already provided stark lessons to
those who would hope to avert military action with endless
diplomacy and appeasement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Make no mistake: if we and our allies do not have the will to
act, there will be more massacres,'' Clinton said. ``In dealing
with aggressors in the Balkans, hesitation is a license to kill.
But action and resolve can stop armies and save lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton warned further that allowing the Kosovo crisis to simmer
could set off related conflicts in neighboring countries. He
mentioned Macedonia, Albania, Greece and Turkey.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm convinced we'll be dragged into this thing under worse
circumstances, at greater cost,'' he said, ''if we don't act.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton made the remarks -- part of his first solo White House
news conference since last April -- as Kosovo peace talks in Paris
collapsed in the face of Serb intransigence.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Begin optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Friday, as the State Department ordered non-essential
personnel to evacuate the U.S. Embassy in Belgrade and some 1,400
international monitors began making their way out of Kosovo as a
precaution against military strikes, Clinton briefed congressional
leaders on the crisis.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're on the brink of a very grave situation,'' House Speaker
Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., told reporters after the two-hour White
House meeting.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we'll be going to bombing pretty soon,'' said Sen. Joe
Biden, D-Del.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman John Warner, R-Va.,
said he expected a full debate on U.S. action in Kosovo early next
week, a further suggestion that Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic may have a few more days to consider the peace plan.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think the meeting added momentum towards the Senate
supporting the president and NATO in this action,'' said Warner.
``Credibility of NATO is on the line.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Warner, ``It is my expectation we will have a strong debate
next week and, hopefully, come to a consensus as how best we can
support our president.''
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Begin optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   The only hope for averting NATO action, Clinton said, is for
Milosevic to sign on to the peace agreement signed Thursday by
Kosovar Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   ``I expect to be working on this all weekend,'' Clinton said,
without elaboration.
</P>
<P>
   Kosovo is a southern province of 2.2 million people -- 90
percent ethnic Albanians and the other 10 percent Serb -- in
Serbia, one of two remaining states that make up Yugoslavia. For
the past year, rebels with the Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA) have
challenged the authority of Serb forces, which have retaliated
against villages and civilians in fighting that has left more than
2,000 dead and some 230,000 homeless.
</P>
<P>
   NATO, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, warned in October
that it would not tolerate continuing Serb military activity in
Kosovo. Clinton authorized, at that time, the use of U.S. forces as
part of any NATO air strikes initiated against the Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has since said, and reiterated Friday, that he was
prepared to strike Serbs if they rejected the peace agreement, as
they did on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   NATO planners have provided target sets for more than 350
warplanes -- half of them American -- standing by to strike Serb
military and communications positions if ordered.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton avoided any discussion of the timing of possible air
strikes. He is scheduled to meet next Wednesday with Russian Prime
Minister Yevgeny Primakov at the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts have speculated that he might prefer to defer strikes
until after that meeting, out of consideration to Russia, which
opposes military action against the Serbs, which have close
historic links to the Russians.
</P>
<P>
   White House security officials, however, said NATO action would
be dictated by conditions on the ground, not by political
considerations.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we can prevent the use of force, that's the preferred
course,'' said one such official, speaking on background. But, this
source stressed, ``NATO's response will be driven by (Serb)
intransigence and the reality of conditions on the ground.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also made clear that he has no deadline in mind for
removing NATO peacekeepers from Kosovo -- should they ever be
deployed there. Such a force would include roughly 4,000 Americans,
under current plans, and Clinton declined to specify a time limit
on their deployment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can just tell you that I think that we have tried to limit
our involvement, we have tried to limit our mission, and we will
conclude it as quickly as we can,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to get in the position in Kosovo that I was in in
Bosnia where the Pentagon came to me with a very honest estimate of
when they thought we could finish, and we turned out to be wrong
about that,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton sent U.S. peacekeepers to Bosnia in December 1995,
vowing that their mission would be over a year later. While the
numbers are down sharply, U.S. peacekeepers remain in Bosnia, where
they help other NATO troops police an uneasy peace. There is no
indication that the mission would end anytime soon.

<P>
   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti _ Five years from now, U.S. aid officials
envision a very different Haiti.
</P>
<P>
   It is a place where elections draw a majority of voters, and the
average woman bears only four children. A place where mayors
provide garbage pick-up, and tourists swarm seaside cities.
</P>
<P>
   They've had these kinds of visions before, however. Five years
go, in fact.
</P>
<P>
   But a U.S. led invasion and a massive infusion of non-military
aid later -- $669 million from the United States alone -- and
unyielding hopes have slammed up against an unshakable reality:
International assistance is no substitute for the Haitian
government's will to reform.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, some key members of Congress are saying -- in
louder and louder voices -- that it is time for the United States
to rethink an aid policy that hasn't always accomplished its goals.
</P>
<P>
   For Clinton administration officials, there is an added sense of
urgency in that the number of Haitian boat people coming to the
United States is steadily increasing. The White House is seeking
another $105 million in aid money for Haiti this year.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at the U.S. Agency for International Development, the
State Department's foreign aid arm, also know they have reached a
critical juncture.
</P>
<P>
   Either show more results, or Congress is likely to get its way
-- sharply reducing aid and exacerbating an already miserable
situation.
</P>
<P>
   USAID officials insist that a new five-year plan will help make
this poor Caribbean country an exemplar of economic prosperity and
democratic institutions.
</P>
<P>
   There is no shortage of ideas from outside the administration,
as well:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Putting more money into rural areas, and farming programs;
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Training seminars on how to resolve differences -- peacefully;
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  And expanding U.S. trade with Haiti.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps no scheme will work. But aid officials agree they must
keep trying.
</P>
<P>
   Said Tom Friedeberg, director here for C.A.R.E., the
Atlanta-based relief organization: ``I am disappointed we haven't
made more progress . . . but if we pulled out now, it would be a
disaster for the country,''
</P>
<P>
   A microcosm of the future can be glimpsed inside a third-grade
classroom at the Immaculate Conception School, an all-girls' school
of about 500 students.
</P>
<P>
   Here, all eyes are fixed on a radio that's prominently displayed
on the teacher's desk.
</P>
<P>
   From that radio, the day's lesson is broadcast.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you have two baskets, and there are five avocados in each
one, then how many avocados do you have?'' asks the voice on the
radio.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ten,'' the students shout in unison. Their teacher nods her
head in approval.
</P>
<P>
   Although a fifth of the class is absent, the 40 or so students
present -- all neatly dressed in blue socks and blue dresses --
seem genuinely enthusiastic about their studies.
</P>
<P>
   USAID officials hope they stay that way.
</P>
<P>
   After spending nearly $20 million to train teachers in a country
where some educators can barely read and write, officials now plan
to spend nearly $20 million more on this form of distance education
known as interactive radio instruction, which allows a radio to
deliver lessons designed by Haiti's best teachers.
</P>
<P>
   Already, 6,200 third-graders in 118 schools are being reached.
</P>
<P>
   The idea is to improve the quality of education while increasing
attendance at schools in a country where only half of all children
aged 6 years to 12 years attend classes.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we're doing is moving away from emergency assistance and
focusing more on programs that can have a long-term impact on
Haiti,'' said Mark Schneider, USAID's assistant director for Latin
America and the Caribbean.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly education is an area that can have a real long-term
impact,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   That's a different approach from the one taken five years ago,
when aid officials were confronted with the challenges of
rebuilding from scratch the hemisphere's poorest nation, where
everything from jobs to clean water was absent.
</P>
<P>
   Then, they set up 2,500 feeding centers and started a short-term
jobs program. They trained a police force to defend citizens rather
than oppress them.
</P>
<P>
   While those efforts will continue, USAID officials will focus
more over the next five years on working directly with local
governments provide services Americans take for granted, such as
garbage pick-up.
</P>
<P>
   USAID also plans to help develop Haiti's tourism industry,
particularly in the picturesque seaside town of Jacmel, located
just 55 miles southwest of Port-au-Prince.
</P>
<P>
   For example, a $1.3 million project to restore Jacmel's wharf
will allow docking for cruise ships bringing up to 2,000 visitors a
day.
</P>
<P>
   For critics of USAID's programs, though, the focus should also
turn to Haiti's long-overlooked countryside.
</P>
<P>
   USAID spends 15 percent of its money on agricultural programs in
rural areas, although two-thirds of the population lives outside
the big cities.
</P>
<P>
   The lack of spending in rural areas -- where three million
people subsist on less than $160 a year -- has caused residents to
migrate, swelling already overcrowded cities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rural areas must be brought more fully into aid programs since
this is where most people live and work,'' said Rachel Neild, a
Haiti expert at the Washington Office on Latin America.
</P>
<P>
   But the challenge of rural development is an intimidating one
because half of Haiti's land is on inclined slopes, rendering
mechanical farming difficult, if not impossible.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Neild says these harsh conditions argue strongly for a
strategy of development in rural areas, if only to keep poverty
from getting any worse.
</P>
<P>
   Others argue that farmers should be encouraged to grow food for
their own tables, rather than products for export -- such as
gourmet coffee -- as has been the focus of many USAID programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``While we have nothing against exports, helping people grow
food for themselves and for the local market is the real way to
foment long-term development,'' said Kevin Murray, executive
director of Grassroots International, a Boston, Mass.-based
independent aid organization.
</P>
<P>
   He said more farm loans and training programs could spark
small-scale agriculture.
</P>
<P>
   Some, also take issue with the roughly $30 million that has been
spent on justice reform without giving consideration to human
rights or conflict resolution -- a must in a society as fragmented
as Haiti's.
</P>
<P>
   Even representatives of the Haitian government say justice
programs should be oriented to ensuring that military officers
responsible for human rights abuses during the coup of 1991 against
President Jean-Bertrand Aristide are brought to trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``This would bring the population together and give people some
real confidence in the justice system, which they don't have now,''
said Ira Kurzban, the Haitian government's Miami-based legal
adviser.
</P>
<P>
   Haitians say more seminars on training their politicians to
resolve differences must be organized.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Haiti, everyone always has to win,'' said Micha Gaillard, a
leader of the socialist National Congress of Democratic Movements
in Haiti.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't know how to compromise or how to play the game of
give and take with one another, and that's created political
problems which have really hurt this country,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps it is the trade battle is brewing in the U.S.
Congress that could have the biggest long-term impact on Haiti's
future development -- and go along way toward reducing dependence
on foreign aid.
</P>
<P>
   More than half the Haitian government's budget now comes from
foreign aid.
</P>
<P>
   Various proposals have been introduced in recent months that
would, if passed, expand the Caribbean Basin Initiative, or CBI,
granting exporters from the Caribbean the same preferential
treatment enjoyed by Mexico under the North American Free Trade
Agreement, or NAFTA.
</P>
<P>
   For years, Caribbean countries, including Haiti, have argued
that they can't compete with Mexico for foreign investment --
particularly in assembly industries -- which their economies need
to reduce unemployment.
</P>
<P>
   Unemployment in Haiti tops 70 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``The United States shouldn't maintain trade barriers against
the poor,'' said Merrill Smith, director of Haiti Advocacy Inc., a
Washington, D.C.-based lobbying group.
</P>
<P>
   But even USAID officials admit privately that economic growth
here will have to average 8 percent to 10 percent -- for several
years in a row -- before real widespread development can occur.
</P>
<P>
   Still, few seem willing to give up on Haiti.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to continue to show great concern over Haiti,'' said
Sen. Mike DeWine, R-Ohio. ``The place is in our own backyard.''

DIFFERENCE FOR CHILDREN IN HAITI

<P>
   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti _ Painfully shy, Maderges Vincent is the
type of child who greets strangers by running to hide.
</P>
<P>
   From a distance, the nine-year-old is so bright, energetic and
giggly with girlfriends she's usually able to fool the casual
observer. But only for a little while.
</P>
<P>
   Then it becomes apparent. She has no arms.
</P>
<P>
   Born here, in the hemisphere's poorest country, where many
handicapped children are effectively written off at birth, Maderges
was abandoned by her parents when she was a mere three months old.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately for her, she was deposited on the front stoop of the
Ecole Saint Vincent Pour Enfants Handicapes, creole for St.
Vincent's School for Handicapped Children.
</P>
<P>
   It's the only place in Haiti designed to care for disabled young
people, be they blind, deaf or, like Maderges, missing limbs.
</P>
<P>
   Founded in 1945 by the Episcopal church, St. Vincent's receives
little money from either the Haitian or American governments.
Rather almost all of the center's money comes from private
donations, mostly from the United States. Its success is proof of
what can be accomplished in Haiti when individuals take matters
into their own hands.
</P>
<P>
   With a relatively meager budget, St. Vincent's has a staff of
130 -- including scores of volunteer doctors and teachers from the
United States, Haiti, and Canada -- that serve nearly 400 kids that
attend the school. About 248 children live there.
</P>
<P>
   About 40 percent are blind. Another 20 percent are deaf. Many of
the rest are missing limbs.
</P>
<P>
   It houses Haiti's only shop for the design and manufacture of
prosthetics, which is staffed by deaf workers, and fashions some
15-20 plastic arms and legs a month -- which helps support the
school.
</P>
<P>
   Little Maderges seems to get along just fine without such
things.
</P>
<P>
   At lunchtime, the dexterous child props her feet up on the
table, just like she would elbows. She gestures with her feet when
she talks. She eats with a fork that dangles, incongruously,
between her toes. She also uses her feet to write and brush her
teeth.
</P>
<P>
   When she's bored, she rests her chin on the bottom of her foot
as if it were the palm of her hand.
</P>
<P>
   Her lack of arms would seem to be an almost-paralyzing
challenge, yet she seems strangely competent.
</P>
<P>
   Best of all, she has friends who understand her disability
because they, too, are disabled.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maderges has no parents, so we're her family now and we've
taken good care of her, because who else was going to do it?'' said
Frantz Casseus(CQ), the school's director.
</P>
<P>
   ``We teach these children to eat by themselves and dress by
themselves,'' he said. ``We stress that they can live normal lives
despite their disabilities.''
</P>
<P>
   By stressing self-reliance, the center gets results in a country
where almost nothing else seems to work.
</P>
<P>
   Here, there is no money for ``social services,'' and prejudice
against the physically disabled runs rampant -- so much so that the
handicapped are generally left to fend for themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``People in Haiti are so poor, and they have their own
overwhelming problems to deal with, so they don't have a lot of
time or compassion for handicapped people,'' said Joseph Jean Paul,
40, who helps care for the children at the center.
</P>
<P>
   Born with no limbs, he came to live at the center when he was
three.
</P>
<P>
   St. Vincent's is located in the middle of a noisy downtown
street just a short walk from Haitian President Rene Preval's
gleaming white palace.
</P>
<P>
   The three-story motel-like structure is a nondescript one, built
around a tiny pool that hasn't seen water in three years and a
concrete play area where only a metal teeter-totter sits rusting.
</P>
<P>
   Electricity is available for only four to six hours a day. The
dormitory rooms are lined with simple bunk beds, and contain few
toys or decorations. The physical therapy room is equally sparse,
although volunteers make due exercising the students with giant
rubber balls and old metal tricycles.
</P>
<P>
   What the center lacks in material resources, however, it makes
up for in spirit.
</P>
<P>
   A cacophony of music swells in the air daily here, as learning
to play a musical instrument is perhaps the biggest part of a
child's education here.
</P>
<P>
   In one dimly lit room, a group of blind children sitting around
a table can be heard practicing ``Top of the World,'' by The
Carpenters on handbells, accompanied by an out-of-tune piano. In
another, St. Vincent's 30-member orchestra may be tuning up for
practice, in preparation for a planned fund-raising concert in the
United States next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The music gives these kids real confidence in themselves,''
Casseus said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year we did our first concert here in Haiti and people
were stunned,'' he added. ``They had no idea handicapped children
could perform so beautifully.''

   LOS ANGELES _ For the creme de la few in this company town, the
day of the Academy Awards has long been the unofficial holiday of
Hollywood, that moment each year when the movie business bows
before a 13-and-a-half-inch gold-plated idol named Oscar.
</P>
<P>
   The exercise has all the rituals of a spiritual quest, from the
ceremonial procession of stretch limousines to the gnashing of
teeth and rending of designer garments.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Hope, the broadcast's longtime host and perennial
non-nominee, once began his monologue by cracking, ``Welcome to the
Academy Awards, or, as it's known at my house, Passover.''
</P>
<P>
   But this year, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences
has made the holiday official.
</P>
<P>
   It is holding the ceremony for the first time in its 71-year
history on what the bold red-and-blue banners outside the Dorothy
Chandler Pavilion on Hope Street proclaim as ``Oscar Sunday,'' in a
bid to win even bigger television viewership for the industry's
single biggest self-advertisement.
</P>
<P>
   The academy's full logo for this year's broadcast on ABC,
plastered at bus stops around town, is ``SUNDAY AT THE OSCARS,''
with each capital ``A'' shaped like a ringing bell, and the Oscar
statuette swinging inside it like a clapper.
</P>
<P>
   Its British-born graphic designer, Arnold Schwartzman, insisted
that no religious overtone was intended.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're not the first person to ask me this,'' Schwartzman said
the other day. ``And I have to tell you that when I first came up
with the concept, I worried that it perhaps had religious
connotations, it being a Sunday. I suppose maybe it's a very
British thing, and maybe that's my excuse.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was born within the sound of Bow Bells,'' in London, he
said, ``and in Europe, bells are used an enormous amount to
announce things, and in celebration. It was sort of a shorthand.''
</P>
<P>
   Schwartzman did not have to look far to draw his Oscar-clapper.
Only as far as the inside of his unlit fireplace, where he keeps
his own Oscar for producing and directing ``Genocide,'' a 1981
documentary about the Holocaust that he made with Rabbi Marvin Hier
of the Simon Wiesenthal Center here.
</P>
<P>
   For 32 of the last 40 years, the awards have been held on
Monday, long considered a slow night for the movie business, while
Sunday attendance was seen as a vital chunk of the weekend grosses.
But in recent years, the academy and the network came to believe
that by broadcasting the ceremony on Sunday, they could start a
half-hour earlier, at 5:30 p.m., and not risk losing precious East
Coast viewers when the show drags past the midnight hour _ and also
avoid weekday traffic headaches through downtown.
</P>
<P>
   The change has pushed back the round of Saturday and Sunday
parties that traditionally kick off a three-day weekend, and means
that win or lose, many nominees will now be expected to show up on
Monday morning for a full week's work.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oscars on Monday was always a snow day in Hollywood,'' said
Sean Daniel, a producer and former studio executive, recalling how
little got done on a nominal workday when stars and moguls had to
be in black tie and ball gowns by midafternoon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now it can be a holiday for the rest of America and not just
Los Angeles,'' said Bruce Vilanch, the comedy writer who is
contributing to his 10th Oscar show this year. ``Except for
hairdressers. If you go down Rodeo Drive on Sunday, you'll just see
`The Sound of Blow-Dryers.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Somehow, the hype and hoopla that always attends the show seems
bigger than ever this year. A single studio, Miramax, has spent
something approaching $15 million, a record, to promote its dark
horse nominees, principally ``Shakespeare in Love'' _ more than it
costs to run a typical race for governor and more than many
presidential contenders will raise this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is called show business,'' said Army Archerd, the Variety
columnist who has presided over the red-carpet arrival ceremonies
for 41 years. ``They're all trying to make a buck out of whatever
they can do. There's no question that it's now almost a full week
celebration. It starts a good 72 hours in advance with the various
parties.''
</P>
<P>
   One past nominee who is sitting out this year's festivities
said, on the condition of anonymity: ``I've never seen it so
overblown. I think that the half-life of sensation in this country
has gotten shorter and shorter and the size of sensation needed to
fill the beast has gotten bigger and bigger. This is the fuel, and
it's no different than O.J. or Monica.''
</P>
<P>
   In practical terms, Sunday is easier for the scores of support
industries that serve Oscar. Joey Henriques, manager of West Coast
operations for Dav El Chauffeured Transportation Network, a
limousine company that calls in reinforcements for this weekend
like a fire department borrowing trucks from neighboring towns,
said the lack of Sunday traffic would ``make a huge difference in
just getting people in and out of there.''
</P>
<P>
   Sara Marks, director of special projects for Vanity Fair, which
holds perhaps the evening's hottest party, at Morton's restaurant
in West Hollywood, said empty parking lots in the neighborhood
would make it easier to set up satellite television trucks and
other equipment needed for ``what is really sort of a military
operation.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   OPTIONAL CUT. STORY CAN END HERE
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Sandi Stratton, who lives in Escondido, and her sister Glenice
Churchill, a beautician from Chino, have come to watch celebrity
arrivals from the Oscar bleachers for 30 straight years. They
staked out their spot on the sidewalk last Saturday, so they would
be first in line when the bleachers open at 7 a.m. Sunday, when
other family members will join them.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you get to see all those people up close, it's worth
it,'' Ms. Stratton said as she sat in a lawn chair, surrounded by a
cooler, cell phone and a two-person tent, perusing a scrapbook of
snapshots of Shirley Temple Black and Claire Trevor from last year.
``My husband just shakes his head and lets me come. But I think
he's kind of proud of us, too.''

<P>
   SANTA ANA, Calif. _ Late one evening in his tattoo shop, Sid
Stankovits bent over the outstretched leg of Jeff Houston, who had
his shoe off and sock turned down. To the buzz of his electric
needle, Stankovits drew a picture on Houston's calf: a kneeling
angel, followed by a cross and Easter lilies.
</P>
<P>
   Tattoos tend to be on the secular side, featuring exotic flowers
or the odd flaming skull. But in Stankovits' shop, and on his own
skin, there are designs with a difference. Yes, he has one tattoo
that says ``Sid'' and another of a crouching panther. But there is
also a portrait of Jesus, a cross and a pair of praying hands.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a job, but our lives are a ministry,'' said
Stankovits, 27, proprietor of Sid's Tattoo Parlor, a tidy, brightly
lighted space in a modest strip mall in this city south of Los
Angeles. ``We're totally blessed that we can bring our ministries
into our jobs.''
</P>
<P>
   The three men who work at Sid's are born-again Christians. So
too are many of their young customers, who include Christian rock
musicians, as well as others like 20-year-old Nick Crocker, whose
left arm is marked by a banner proclaiming, ``1 Thess. 5:17,'' the
biblical verse in which the Apostle Paul says, ``Pray without
ceasing.''
</P>
<P>
   Three academic researchers who have studied Sid's have discerned
a trend emerging, at least on the West Coast. They wrote a
scholarly paper titled, ``Marked for Jesus: Sacred Tattooing Among
a `New Generation' of Evangelicals.''
</P>
<P>
   In it the three _ Donald E. Miller, a professor of religion at
the University of Southern California, Richard W. Flory, an
associate professor of sociology at Biola University, and Lori
Jensen, a doctoral student at Southern California _ say that ``for
a small but growing subculture within evangelical Christianity,
religious tattooing is becoming an increasingly legitimate
expression of individuality, identity and faith.''
</P>
<P>
   No one claims to know how widespread the practice is, although
Ms. Jensen said she knew people who had been tattooists, became
born-again Christians and then ``stayed in the profession.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Ms. Jensen, 24, displayed a photograph of a
tattoo on her back, and said her tattoos included a cross, floral
design and the phrases ``Approved unto God'' and ``II Tim. 2:15.''
The phrases were references to a verse in St. Paul's Second Letter
to Timothy: ``Do your best to present yourself to God as one
approved by him, a worker who has no need to be ashamed, rightly
explaining the word of truth.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I like studying the Bible a lot,'' Ms. Jensen said, ``so that
verse has a lot of significance.''
</P>
<P>
   Stankovits, who opened his shop in 1996, became born again by
accepting Jesus as his personal savior before he became a
tattooist. He is related to an important figure in evangelical
Protestantism, having married a granddaughter of the Rev. Chuck
Smith, pastor of Calvary Chapel in nearby Costa Mesa. By reaching
out to hippies around 1970, Smith became a leading figure in what
many called the ``Jesus Movement.'' Calvary Chapel grew into a
church with thousands of members and spawned a movement with
hundreds of congregations.
</P>
<P>
   Until she went back to school, Stankovits' wife, Jennifer, 21,
also worked at Sid's. On a visit, she displayed a tattoo on her
forearm of a cross rising above ocean waves beneath the motto,
``Rock of Ages.''
</P>
<P>
   Houston, 27, who got the angel tattoo, goes with his wife to
Smith's church. He chose his tattoo design, he said, because it
also adorned his father's headstone.
</P>
<P>
   Several people at Sid's said a tattoo allowed its bearer to
``witness,'' or share a message of faith.
</P>
<P>
   That is how Rob Silva, 32, became born again. A professional
tattooist, he became curious when a friend showed him a religious
tattoo. Nowadays, Silva works with Stankovits at Sid's, where his
work station has a sticker that says, ``I'm the Christian that
Satan warned you about.'' On the wall behind him are photos of
Christian rock bands, many of them autographed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We tattoo a lot of Christian bands,'' he explained.
</P>
<P>
   One customer on a recent afternoon was Robert Goodwin, the
29-year-old bass player with Headnoise, a Christian punk band, on
whose arm Silva drew a portrait of Jesus.
</P>
<P>
   ``The obvious reason is Christ is my savior and my body is a
testimony of him,'' Goodwin said. ``A lot of people will ask
questions about the tattoos, and I'll get an opportunity to share
my faith.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Goodwin has found Sid's to be an oasis.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before a shop like this,'' he said, ``we had to go to shops
where people were cussing, smoking, doing drugs. A whole lot of bad
things were going on.''
</P>
<P>
   Stankovits, who leads a Friday evening Bible study in a
storefront close by, said a few customers had been converted as a
result of conversations in the shop. But he, Silva and the shop's
other tattooist, 20-year-old Eric Jones, said they did not try to
talk about religious faith to anyone who did not want to hear it.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, about 40 percent of the tattoos they do are purely
secular designs, like people's names, animals and the sort of
modest pinup girls that one might have seen in an earlier era. One
recent evening, Stankovits worked on a full ``sleeve,'' an
arm-length tattoo, of a Japanese dragon, on a young man.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what so cool about tattooing,'' Stankovits said. ``It's
so individualized.''

AWARDS SHOW GIVES L.A. FINANCIAL BOOST
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY MARLA MATZER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Winning an Academy Award can boost an actor's
stature and asking price. That's why you'll see a lot of nervous
faces as the nominees are read tonight.
</P>
<P>
   But there is one guaranteed winner every year: the economy of
Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   The Oscars are a yearly bonanza for the proprietors of catering
and limousine services and floral shops, to name just a few. Some
businesses credit Oscar with bringing in as much as a quarter of
their annual income.
</P>
<P>
   Tonight's awards ceremony will generate an estimated $60 million
in total revenue for L.A. In a reciprocal gesture, the city is
kicking in services -- primarily traffic control and sign postings
-- worth $19,000 toward staging the event.
</P>
<P>
   ``Each year, the Oscars seem to be getting more elaborate. ...
They've added the nominees' luncheon, and this year they've moved
the ceremony to Sunday,'' said Jack Kyser, chief economist of the
Los Angeles County Economic Development Corp. Kyser's organization
says this year's $60 million is up from just $35 million five years
ago, and is growing.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, other events draw more dollars.
</P>
<P>
   The 2000 Democratic convention in L.A. is expected to bring in
$135 million. And a Super Bowl attracts a whopping $200 million to
its host city each year, according to Kyser's estimates.
</P>
<P>
   But a city is lucky to get a Super Bowl once a decade or
national political convention every two or three decades. L.A. has
a big advantage when it comes to the Academy Awards -- it doesn't
have to compete for them each year the way, say, Super Bowl and
Olympics host cities must vie for those prizes. ``That's the beauty
of the Oscars for L.A.,'' Kyser said.
</P>
<P>
   And as far as other awards shows, the Academy Awards dwarfs them
all.
</P>
<P>
   The Grammys, which returned to Los Angeles from New York this
year, brought in an estimated $26 million, for example. Trophies
like the Emmys and the Tonys pale even more by comparison.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the last five Oscar ceremonies have generated more
revenue combined than one Super Bowl for Los Angeles. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; That's especially impressive since the public can't buy tickets
to the Academy Awards. Rather than attracting a large number of
visitors who will attend the event itself (though there are
die-hards who will wait for hours to watch the celebrities arrive),
the Oscars act more as a year-round advertisement to the 23 million
people a year who visit L.A.
</P>
<P>
   Why the growth of an event like the Oscars? It's a convergence
of fame, money and millions of viewers the likes of which is rarely
seen outside of top sporting events. Quite simply, money begets
money.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Oscars are one of the few regularly scheduled events of
this kind that have this kind of pull,'' said Jim Andrews, vice
president of Chicago-based event marketing firm IEG Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Andrews, whose firm tracks spending on event and sports-related
marketing, said the Academy Awards appear to be moving in the same
direction as the Super Bowl in expanding into multiday events.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Super Bowl in a way has become a trade show for the sports
and marketing businesses,'' Andrews said. ``More than half the
people (visiting the host city) don't have tickets to the actual
game. They're there because they want to be part of the buzz, or to
be near their clients, the players' managers, what have you.''
</P>
<P>
   In this way, the Oscars can provide even more of a bonanza for
companies looking for publicity. The products players wear and use
during the Super Bowl, for example, are strictly regulated by
agreements struck by the National Football League and other
parties. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Movie stars, on the other hand, can pick and choose clothing
and jewelry designers. A number of designers rent hotel suites and
invite nominees to select pricey items to wear free of charge in
exchange for the publicity.
</P>
<P>
   Harry Winston Jewelers, for example, has cashed in on this
marketing technique for a half-century.
</P>
<P>
   This year, Winston will reportedly lend 30 pieces of jewelry,
valued at $50 million, to the nominees, who will be closely watched
by an audience of perhaps 80 million or more. Last year's ceremony
attracted a record TV audience of 87 million, though many think
that number was puffed up by the dominance of popular favorite
``Titanic.'' Even if viewership is off a bit this year, the numbers
remain heady.
</P>
<P>
   The awards' halo effect for L.A. is expected to be further
magnified when a new permanent home for the ceremony is completed
in Hollywood within a couple of years. The project, at the corner
of Highland Avenue and Hollywood Boulevard, ``will put this
spotlight of the entertainment industry literally on Hollywood,''
said Michael Collins, executive vice president of the Los Angeles
Convention and Visitors Bureau.
</P>
<P>
   Collins and other civic boosters hope the new 3,300-seat theater
and 60,000-square-foot ballroom at the site will help to finally
give Hollywood, which has gotten seedy over the years, a
much-needed boost. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; ``The Oscars represent one of the most distinguishing
characteristics of Los Angeles,'' Collins said. ``The event reminds
people of one of the most powerful brand names in the world:
Hollywood.''
</P>
<P>
   Everyone seems to agree that the Oscars are on track to become a
bigger and bigger event for Los Angeles over the coming years. ``I
think (the Academy) is just beginning to realize what the ceremony
means, and they're creating more events around it,'' Kyser said.
</P>
<P>
   Andrews points to the move of the ceremony to Sunday -- which
should guarantee a bigger TV audience -- as an example of the
Academy's drive toward super-event status.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pepsi is unveiling their new ad campaign during the Oscar
ceremony this year. In the past, they've done that during the Super
Bowl. That's obviously significant,'' Andrews said.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles boosters say ultimately, though, that a price can't
even be affixed to all the benefits and goodwill generated by
Hollywood's yearly crowning ceremony. ``I'll tell you what it's
worth: It's priceless,'' Collins said. ``You can't put a dollar
amount on it.''

ECHOES OF TOBACCO BATTLE IN GUN LAWSUITS
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ga., Ill., Fla., La., Conn., S.D.)   (jw) 
 By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The battle lines look familiar. On one side are
public officials who are frustrated because they have been unable
to get laws passed regulating an industry that makes a dangerous
product. Egged on by trial lawyers, the officials have sued the
industry to try to win in court what they cannot win in the
political arena.
</P>
<P>
   On the other side, the companies in the besieged industry have
banded together and pooled their money to fight the lawsuits and
pay for extensive lobbying and advertising campaigns that they hope
will protect their political advantage.
</P>
<P>
   For years, these were the competing forces in the tobacco wars.
That issue is more or less settled. Now it is the gun manufacturers
who are being attacked in court and who are mobilizing to defend
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Five cities _ Atlanta, Chicago, Miami, New Orleans and
Bridgeport, Conn. _ have sued gun manufacturers and their trade
associations seeking reimbursement for what they say are the
millions of dollars they must spend each year in their police
departments and hospitals because of gun violence. Many other
cities are considering similar lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   The suits are similar to the ones brought by more than 40 state
attorneys general against the tobacco companies, for the money the
states said they spent to treat people with smoking-related
illnesses. After several years of fighting, the tobacco companies
agreed this year to pay the states $246 billion over 25 years.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the cigarette makers, the companies that make firearms _
including such familiar names as Colt's Manufacturing Co., the
Smith &AMP; Wesson Corp. and Sturm, Ruger &AMP; Co. _ had no experience
working together for common causes. But now they have formed an
umbrella group called the Hunting and Shooting Sports Heritage Fund
to fight the legal attack. They have been joined by many companies
that make products like camping equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Each member has vowed to contribute 1 percent of its sales.
Robert Delfay, the director of the fund, said he hoped to raise an
annual budget as large as $20 million for litigation expenses,
lobbying and advertising.
</P>
<P>
   If all 1,400 companies that had exhibits at the industry's
annual Shot Show in Atlanta last month joined, Delfay said, the
budget could be as large as $50 million.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, the National Rifle Association, with its 3 million
dues-paying members, has often gone a separate way from the
manufacturers. But it, too, feels threatened by the lawsuits, and
the association has committed its formidable lobbying strength.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their customers are our members,'' said James Baker, the NRA's
chief lobbyist. ``If they are driven out of business, it certainly
limits the sources and affects the prices of products our
membership buys.''
</P>
<P>
   Largely because of the NRA's lobbying, a law was enacted in
Georgia this winter outlawing suits by the cities against the gun
makers. A similar measure has been approved by the South Dakota
Legislature and is expected to be signed by Republican Gov. William
Janklow next week. Baker said there was a good chance that bills
along these lines would become law this year in more than a dozen
other states, mostly in the South and West.
</P>
<P>
   A bill prohibiting the suits has also been introduced in
Congress by Rep. Bob Barr, R-Ga., who is on the NRA board. This
bill stands little chance.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Chamber of Commerce and other business organizations
are also backing the gun makers, just as they did the cigarette
companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``They started with tobacco,'' said Jim Wootton, director of the
chamber's Institute for Legal Reform, an organization formed to
combat trial lawyers. ``Now it's guns. This can be used against any
industry.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Robert Ricker, the new executive director of the American
Shooting Sports Council, a trade association that represents gun
dealers and distributors, said the firearms industry had learned
from the tobacco industry that ``the surest way to win these kinds
of battles is to form coalitions.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of the same trial lawyers who brought suits against tobacco
companies are involved in the lawsuits against the gun
manufacturers. Most of them are part of the Castano Group, a
coalition of 65 law firms formed in 1994 to finance the case of
Peter Castano, a lawyer who died of lung cancer, and to fashion a
nationwide class-action lawsuit against the cigarette industry.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers from this group are representing New Orleans in its suit
and are consulting with other cities.
</P>
<P>
   The cities' arguments in their lawsuits are similar to those the
attorneys general made against the tobacco industry: The gun makers
failed to make safe products and, just as the tobacco companies
were accused of marketing cigarettes to minors, the gun industry
markets its product to criminals.
</P>
<P>
   But the cities face hurdles that did not exist in the tobacco
cases. Unlike cigarettes, which can be deadly when used as the
manufacturers intended, guns have safe and proper uses like hunting
and target shooting. Moreover, there is scant evidence of corporate
deception the way there was with the cigarette makers, and no
whistle-blower has emerged in the arms industry.
</P>
<P>
   Most important, the gun makers, with annual sales in this
country of about $1.5 billion, do not have the deep pockets of the
cigarette companies, which have sales of $45 billion. This could
discourage trial lawyers who make their money from a percentage of
the damages they win.
</P>
<P>
   The suits are not likely to go to trial anytime soon. First, the
question of whether the states have the constitutional authority to
block lawsuits by the cities may need to be answered, and it could
take the Supreme Court to resolve the matter.
</P>
<P>
   The tobacco companies sought from the beginning to settle their
cases out of court. But spurred on by the hard-line approach of the
National Rifle Association, the gun makers, at least for the time
being, say they are confident they can win in court and have no
interest in settlements.
</P>
<P>
   This issue broke into the open last month when Richard Feldman,
Ricker's predecessor as director of the American Shooting Sports
Council, was forced to resign. Feldman, who was traveling in Europe
this week and could not be reached, had been having quiet
discussions with some of the lawyers about settling lawsuits. Those
in the industry who demanded his ouster said he was too eager to
compromise with the opposition.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks like we'll have to litigate these things to
judgment,'' said John Coale, a lawyer who was involved with the
Castano group and who now represents New Orleans in its case
against the gun makers.

COUNTY'S BEE INSPECTOR HAS LONELY BUT EVENTFUL JOB
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY DOUGLAS HABERMAN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ John Hurley is suited up in his white protective
coveralls, rubber boots, gloves that reach to the elbow and a sort
of pith helmet with a fine mesh veil hanging all around from the
brim. He is flicking a small net on a stick.
</P>
<P>
   It's not butterflies he is chasing, it's bees.
</P>
<P>
   His mission: to find out if yet another Los Angeles County
neighborhood has been colonized by dangerous Africanized honey
bees, to see if another black dot needs to be marked on the
county's map of ``killer bee'' colonies.
</P>
<P>
   Hurley is the county's lone bee inspector. In the battle to
inform the public about Africanized honey bees, Hurley is part
reconnaissance man, part scientist, part educator.
</P>
<P>
   ``This isn't a job a lot of people are trying to get,'' he says.
``I love this job. I think bees are fascinating.''
</P>
<P>
   Hurley says he is happy to be teaching the public to avoid a
potential danger while allaying their wildest fears.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bees are a fact,'' he says. ``They're going to be a
day-to-day reality in Los Angeles County. It's not the end of the
world.''
</P>
<P>
   Hurley, 51, has short red hair going white on the fringes and
the ruddy complexion of a fair-skinned person who spends a lot of
time in the sun. He wears oversize squarish glasses and a badge on
his light green khaki shirt that says Inspector.
</P>
<P>
   He grew up marveling at bugs and graduated in January 1975 from
California State University, Long Beach with a bachelor's degree in
entomology. He hired on with the county Department of Agricultural
Commissioner as an inspector trainee and has been there in numerous
capacities ever since. He's been the bee inspector since summer
1997.
</P>
<P>
   On this day, he's at a small white stucco house in Artesia. At
an opening in a side wall where an air conditioner might once have
sat, from behind a piece of fiberboard meant to cover the gap, bees
are coming and going. Nearby is a blossoming orange tree.
</P>
<P>
   Hurley snares four to six bees in his net in several rapid
swipes, then kneels on the concrete driveway and forces the bees
into a small plastic bottle filled with alcohol. They quickly die.
</P>
<P>
   He knocks on the wall and taps on the fiberboard to draw more
bees out. They don't act aggressive; they don't attack the way
Africanized bees are known to when they are defending a colony.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is pretty mild,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   He collects more than 40 of the bees.
</P>
<P>
   Tenant Guadalupe Lopez (a man) says in Spanish that he first saw
the bees two years ago, then they left. Then about a year ago they
returned.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there's honey in there,'' Lopez says, looking at the
wall from which the bees are emerging.
</P>
<P>
   ``There (ITAL) is (END ITAL) honey in there,'' Hurley says when
told of Lopez's remark. He estimates about 10,000 bees are in the
wall, which are popular places for bees to call home.
</P>
<P>
   Hurley tells Lopez the house's owner needs to hire a pest
control operator to remove the bees.
</P>
<P>
   Hurley's next stop is a Long Beach house whose owner had told
county officials she's seen numerous bees, dead and alive, on her
property. But Hurley finds no evidence of a colony.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bee careful!'' a GTE crew member working at the house jokingly
warns Hurley as he's heading back to his county truck.
</P>
<P>
   Hurley shakes his head. ``If I had a nickel for every time I've
heard that, I could retire,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Hurley does get stung frequently, he says. Once he was taking a
television news crew out with him. He was wearing black socks. He
didn't put rubber boots on. He was stung six to eight times on each
ankle.
</P>
<P>
   ``The swelling went down within a couple days,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Only after the incident, he adds, did his predecessor tell him
that bees attack black because it's the color of the snout of
animals, such as bears, that will eat their honey.
</P>
<P>
   Hurley uses a Benadryl ``pencil'' to reduce the swelling, pain
and itching that accompany bee stings. ``I keep it in the truck,''
he says.
</P>
<P>
   Hurley loves being outdoors. But his job also requires
considerable time on the telephone with other agencies and with the
public.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's so many junk calls,'' he says, referring to calls by
people who think they could be dealing with killer bees but are
actually dealing with something completely different.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't look like any bee I've ever seen'' is what these
callers often tell him, he says. And that's often because they
aren't looking at honey bees but at yellowjackets or wasps or
carpenter bees or even green fig beetles. Africanized honey bees
look just like European honey bees to the naked eye.
</P>
<P>
   Hurley doesn't just field calls from residents, he also goes
out, days and evenings, to educate groups about the killer bees.
</P>
<P>
   ``I talk to everybody from kindergarten classes to Kiwanis,'' he
says. After the trip to Artesia and Long Beach, Hurley returns to
his office in El Monte. In the entomology lab, he plucks the right
forewings off 10 of the 40 bees from Artesia with a tweezers and
measures them under a microscope. The wings are too long _
averaging more than nine millimeters each _ for the bees to be
Africanized.
</P>
<P>
   ``These were European,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   If they had seemed Africanized, he would have shipped the bees
up to the state Department of Food and Agriculture in Sacramento
for DNA testing.
</P>
<P>
   And if testing had confirmed they were Africanized, one more
black dot would have darkened the county's map of the killer bees.

MATH TEXTBOOK SALTED WITH BRAND NAMES RAISES NEW ALARM

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Joe Stein got a big surprise last fall when his 11-year-old son
Noah asked him for help with homework. There on the page of Noah's
sixth-grade math textbook was ``what looked like an ad for a chain
electronics store,'' said Stein. Going through the rest of the
book, Stein discovered references to a wide array of brand-name
consumer products, from Nike and Gatorade to Disneyland and Topps
baseball cards, many of which appeared in illustrations as well.
And that made him angry.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has to use this textbook, and he has to do the work that is
intertwined with these advertisements,'' said Stein, whose son
attends middle school in Albany, Calif., north of Berkeley. ``I
found it offensive that the lesson he was learning was about
commercialism and how even the school district and other public
forums weren't free from this sort of thing. I also wondered who
was getting paid for this. I assumed that textbooks wouldn't put
this free of charge in the text.''
</P>
<P>
   The textbook, ``Mathematics: Applications and Connections,''
published by McGraw-Hill Inc. in 1995 and revised this year, is
used in schools in about 15 states, including California and Texas,
and has been approved for use in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   But a spokesman for McGraw-Hill said the publisher received no
payments from companies whose products appear in the book. ``We
have no commercial or promotional arrangements to use particular
brands,'' said the spokesman, Neal Allen. One of the book's authors
said that the well-known products were included simply to make the
math problems more relevant to sixth graders.
</P>
<P>
   Yet critics contend that the textbook amounts to a collection of
advertisements that, especially because they appear in a book used
in the classroom, press specific consumer products onto
unsuspecting schoolchildren. The blizzard of name-dropping and
product images, along with almost reverential descriptions of the
companies, can only make children more brand-conscious, they say.
</P>
<P>
   ``This looks like product placement, as they do in the movies,''
said David Walsh, director of the National Institute on Media and
the Family, based in Minneapolis, which studies the effect of
advertising on families. ``The effect is the same. It gets at what
I call the golden rule of influence, which is when the person being
influenced doesn't even know it.''
</P>
<P>
   Stein, a lawyer for the federal government in San Francisco,
complained about the 1995 edition of the textbook. The 1999 version
remains drenched with product shots and trivia about everything
from Barbie dolls (Mattel), Cocoa Frosted Flakes (Kellogg), Sony
Play Stations, Spalding basketballs, characters and entertainment
sites owned by Disney and Warner Bros. and fast-food fare from
Burger King and McDonald's.
</P>
<P>
   Those who oppose salting a textbook with brand names say it is
the most egregious example of advertising's steady march through
public education.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the first time we've seen advertising in
state-subsidized textbooks,'' said Andrew Hagelshaw, senior program
director at the Center for Commercial-Free Public Education in
Oakland, Calif. Noting that taxpayer dollars paid for textbooks
that school districts bought from McGraw-Hill, he added, ``It
crosses a line that hasn't been crossed before.''
</P>
<P>
   He and others trace the trend of school acceptance of
advertising to 1989, when thousands of schools began signing up for
free televisions offered by Channel One. In return they had to
agree to show their pupils current-affairs programming that
included commercials from many consumer product companies eager to
pitch their wares to children.
</P>
<P>
   School districts are seen as prime targets by computer software
publishers, fast-food chains, soft-drink bottlers and other
corporations, which believe that brand loyalty begins at an early
age. Some offer schools lucrative contracts intended to promote
their products and keep their competitors out.
</P>
<P>
   The McGraw-Hill textbook is intended to turn word problems into
real-life situations to better teach the principles of sixth-grade
math.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the 1995 edition, still in use in many places,
introduces a decimal division problem as follows: ``Will is saving
his allowance to buy a pair of Nike shoes that cost $68.25. If Will
earns $3.25 per week, how many weeks will Will need to save?'' To
the right of the text is a full-color picture of a pair of Nikes.
</P>
<P>
   Another word problem, this one in the 1999 edition, gives a plug
to Oreos, made by Nabisco: ``The best-selling packaged cookie in
the world is the Oreo cookie,'' it begins. ``The diameter of an
Oreo cookie is 1.75 inches. Express the diameter of an Oreo cookie
as a fraction in simplest form.''
</P>
<P>
   A section on surface area in the same edition asks students to
calculate the surface area of a box of Cocoa Frosted Flakes, adding
some gratuitous information about when the cereal was introduced.
Another page, titled ``School to Career,'' highlights Lands' End,
the mail-order apparel company. ``Consumers can purchase unique
clothing and accessories, and products for the home,'' the section
reads.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone insists on keeping the schools pure of consumer
product information. But the math book goes too far, its critics
say, in making references to products and companies so specifically
and without any real context.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you want children to deal with the real world, tell them to
go out there and compare the prices of Nike and Reebok and Adidas
and a store brand,'' suggested Charlotte Baecher, director of the
Zillions Education Center at Consumers Union, which tries to
sharpen children's awareness about advertising. ``Then they will be
getting a real lesson, instead of just a reinforcement that Nike is
the most popular brand.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   She added that the word problem featuring Nike was an effective
advertisement. ``The whole point of advertising to kids is not
about getting any particular message out,'' she said. ``It's about
getting that brand name to hit them in all sorts of places.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the book's 12 authors, Patricia S. Wilson, an associate
professor in the mathematics education department at the University
of Georgia, said the brand names were scattered through the book
almost unconsciously.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't recall ever actually discussing not using logos,'' she
said. ``Certainly, we didn't discuss trying to use logos. It was
more the examples that people came up with.''
</P>
<P>
   She said she knew of no company that had paid to be included in
the book, adding, ``What would bother me is if I knew there was
some kind of financial agreement with somebody.''
</P>
<P>
   One suggestion she did recall was using commercial logos as part
of a section on symmetry. ``You're trying to get into what people
are familiar with, so they can see, hey, mathematics is in the
world out there,'' she said. Putting real-life situations into math
problems for sixth graders, she added, ``is an important issue _
having products that are interesting to that age group, to hook
into where they are.''
</P>
<P>
   In California, the attention drawn to the book by Stein prompted
one legislator to sponsor a bill to ban commercial references and
logos in school textbooks. In fact, California already has a state
guideline intended to prevent such references, but as Stein's
experience shows, it does not always work.
</P>
<P>
   Kerry Mazzoni, chairwoman of the California State Assembly's
education committee, introduced the bill in January. She said the
state needed to be careful about the messages it sent
schoolchildren. ``We as a state should not be in a position of
promoting one private-sector product over another,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Allen said that McGraw-Hill, prompted by Ms. Mazzoni's proposal,
was ``reviewing our policy with regard to screening out corporate
logos.'' And he noted that textbooks were developed and revised in
consultation with school committees that make suggestions about
what should and should not be included.
</P>
<P>
   In California, the textbook was reviewed for compliance with
state guidelines by a county education office, said Doug Stone, a
spokesman for the state Department of Education. Because
McGraw-Hill originally offered the book free to the state, he
added, ``it may not have received the thorough scrutiny that it
should have gone through.''
</P>
<P>
   California has demanded that future editions purchased by its
school districts not carry brand names, Stone said, although he did
not know when those editions would be printed.
</P>
<P>
   Permission to use the names and logos of some of the companies
mentioned in the math textbook was sought and granted. Anna
Rozevich, a spokeswoman for McDonald's, said her company was
approached, ``but we did not pay to be in the book.'' McDonald's
gave permission for use of its name and logo, she said, because
using real products ``seemed to have intrinsic educational value
for the children.''
</P>
<P>
   But apparently no such permission was sought from several other
companies regarding their images or statements concerning their
products, according to their spokesmen.
</P>
<P>
   Ann Smith, a spokeswoman for Nabisco, said she could find no
record of any request. Asked why Oreos might have been chosen for
the math book, rather than Hydrox or other similar-looking brands,
she said: ``They probably wanted to represent something the masses
would have knowledge of. Oreo is an American icon.''
</P>
<P>
   That the companies did not pay anything for what would seem to
be invaluable exposure to impressionable young minds through a
school textbook is almost more troubling than if they had, some
critics said. They say that fact reveals much about how the battle
to keep classrooms free of commercialism has been lost.
</P>
<P>
   ``It isn't implausible that a textbook writer simply chose this
brand-name product without even thinking about it,'' said Alex
Molnar, who directs the Center for the Study of Commercialism in
Education at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, referring to
the Oreo example. ``But somebody ought to catch it.''

`TWO FOR AMERICA' BEAT THE DRUMS FOR THE MILITARY  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ill., Ind., Mass., Minn.)  By ELIZABETH BECKER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Among the defense secretaries of the last half
century whose pictures on magazine covers decorate a drab corridor
of the Pentagon, one stands out. It is not George Marshall, the
``Man of Crisis'' on a 1950 U.S. News &AMP; World Report, or Caspar W.
Weinberger, who wonders ``How to Spend a Trillion'' on a 1981 Time
cover.
</P>
<P>
   It is William S. Cohen, the current secretary of defense, who
shares the front of Parade magazine with his wife, Janet Langhart
Cohen, under the headline, ``Two For America.''
</P>
<P>
   That portrait is not just another example of Cohen's famous
sentimentality. (True, the former Republican senator, who married
three years ago on Valentine's Day, has written, among other
things, an ode to the F-15 fighter jet.) The headline is an apt
description of a rare public relations campaign by the husband-wife
Cohen team. With public appearances, musical events and Mrs.
Cohen's new weekly television show broadcast to armed forces bases
around the globe, the Cohens are on a mission to bridge the gap
between the civilian and military cultures.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Cohen has undertaken a role that is almost unheard for a
Cabinet spouse, even one known as the first lady of the Pentagon.
</P>
<P>
   But for Janet Cohen, 56, it is just the latest interesting twist
in a 30-year television career, though the first time she has
worked free.
</P>
<P>
   While courts the civilian world, beating the drum for increasing
military pay as well as the military budget, Janet Cohen acts as a
one-woman morale booster for the armed services.
</P>
<P>
   With all the high-voltage emotion that was her professional
trademark as anchor, correspondent and talk show host at ABC, NBC,
CBS and Black Entertainment Network, she tells the troops they are
``awesome,'' that the country appreciates their hard work and that
they should keep at it.
</P>
<P>
   Think part Eleanor Roosevelt, part Oprah Winfrey.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mission is to support Bill,'' Mrs. Cohen said in an
interview last week. ``He's the passion of my life, and it's
impassioned me about our military people.''
</P>
<P>
   Seated in her penthouse apartment with wraparound balconies
overlooking Pennsylvania Avenue, she said: ``My role just evolved
on my travels with Bill where we talked about the need for the
country to reconnect with the military, to let them know the fine
job they're doing, how we're all in awe of our military.''
</P>
<P>
   In the last two months she has started her weekly television
series, ``Special Assignment,'' for the armed services
international broadcast network, in which she interviews civilian
and military leaders. Her first subject was President Clinton,
aboard Air Force One, and she has lined up Tom Cruise, Hollywood's
``Top Gun,'' and Gov. Jesse Ventura of Minnesota, for later
programs.
</P>
<P>
   With her husband, she recently was the host of a ``Pentagon
Pops'' musical salute to the military performed by military
musicians at Constitution Hall. At the event, Cohen said the show
came about because ``Janet simply asked, `Why not the best music
for the best military in the world?' ''
</P>
<P>
   By the end of the month she will have her own Web site.
</P>
<P>
   Her volunteer efforts are not just a vanity project, Pentagon
officials say, but a high-profile effort to bolster recruiting
goals that have proved out of reach despite plans to raise military
pay by more than 4 percent, with bonuses of about 10 percent, and a
national nostalgia for the patriotism of World War II started by
the movie ``Saving Private Ryan.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not easy when we're competing against one of the most
vibrant economies in history,'' Mrs. Cohen said. ``And that means
holding onto the families, too, by giving them good housing, pay,
retirement, medical care and education for their kids.''
</P>
<P>
   While this is the basic boilerplate message of her husband, the
same points, when made in front of the troops by Mrs. Cohen, a
former model and one of the first African-American women to break
into national television, seem more like entertainment, and that
has earned her high marks in some serious circles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Raising the esprit de corps is critical, which is why what
she's doing is so worthwhile,'' said Michael O'Hanlon, a military
analyst at the Brookings Institution.
</P>
<P>
   Kati Marton, who is writing a book on ``First Couples'' and is
part of a power couple with Richard C. Holbrooke, whose nomination
as ambassador to the United Nations is pending in Congress, said of
Mrs. Cohen: ``What she's doing is very much in keeping with that
activist engaged role that Eleanor Roosevelt pioneered. She is
essential to her husband's well-being and his job, and she is
taking a full role in both.``
</P>
<P>
   Reared in the housing projects of Indianapolis by a single
mother, she studied at Butler University and Indiana University but
quit when she won a $500 beauty contest in Chicago. That led to
modeling jobs in Chicago and then her big break as the weather
woman on a Chicago television station.
</P>
<P>
   After that she was the host of the morning program ``Indy
Today'' on an Indianapolis television station, then moved to a
network affiliate in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was very, very lucky,'' Mrs. Cohen says. She had been
married twice when she began dating Cohen, who was then a senator
from Maine and who also was divorced.
</P>
<P>
   They married shortly before Cohen, now 58, was named defense
secretary in late 1996. She is now running Langhart Communications,
teaching corporate executives how to handle the news media. But she
also has traveled with her husband to Spain and Bulgaria, to the
Middle East and South Korea. Whenever she visits the troops, she
mingles with them, eliciting the whoops and yells normally
associated with movie stars, not politicians' wives.
</P>
<P>
   ``You hear the national anthem, you go to the bases, and it has
a different feeling,'' she said. ``I get very emotional.''

   The most ambitious of Mrs. Cohen's projects is the Special
Assignment segments for the 156 stations of the armed forces
international network overseas and replayed on videotape on the
bases in the United States. She started the series this month with
her 30-minute interview of Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Her toughest question was, `Sir, with all due respect, you
offered the highest budget proposal in a long time _ ever. But is
it enough when you talk about the things we're asking of them to
do?''
</P>
<P>
   After agreeing that nothing was too good for the military, the
president was steered by Mrs. Cohen to describe the idealism of the
troops who helped the Central American victims of Hurricane Mitch
and served as peacekeepers in Bosnia, as well as their sacrifices.
He needed little prompting.
</P>
<P>
   In her weekly interviews, Mrs. Cohen says she will be mining
that strain of idealism as she invites members of the armed
services, celebrities, business leaders and politicians to make
what she calls ``testimonials on air'' for the military.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen sees nothing but good in her efforts.
</P>
<P>
   ``She touches people,'' he said in an interview. ``She can
infuse them with a sense of real spirit. As to the difference she
is making, out in the field, every single leader that I meet, the
first question is, `Why didn't you bring your wife?' ''

   NATIONAL FORECAST
</P>
<P>
   Two disturbances in separate branches of the jet stream will
begin to merge along the East Coast on Sunday. Low pressure moving
through the Southeast will have an ample supply of moisture while a
cold front pushing through the Great Lakes will draw chilly air
southward from Canada.
</P>
<P>
   The two areas of unsettled weather will join over the Northeast
on Sunday night as wet snow begins to accumulate in the northern
Appalachians, specifically in western New York and Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   The day will dawn bright and crisp in New England, but high
pressure will slide offshore by midday allowing clouds to quickly
increase. A cold rain will soak parts of the middle Atlantic region
as chilly air is wedged along the east slopes of the central
Appalachians. Showers and a few thunderstorms will accompany a cold
front along the southeast coast. However, much of Florida will stay
dry.
</P>
<P>
   A swath of light snow will coat upper Michigan and northern
Wisconsin. Snow showers will extend southward around Lake Michigan.
Winds will increase to gale force over Lake Superior. A few showers
of rain and wet snow will develop in the eastern Lakes by
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   High pressure extending from Manitoba to Texas will promote dry
and seasonable conditions in the Plains and eastern Rockies. A
complex disturbance will produce showers from Idaho to the northern
Sierra with snow above 5,500 feet. The Northwest will not be as
warm or bright, as showers move north. Clouds will persist along
the California shoreline, but the deserts of the Southwest will see
sunshine with seasonably mild air.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Equinoctial Storms
</P>
<P>
   The arrival of spring Saturday night was an astronomical event,
not a meteorological one, but ancient mariners believed that the
time of equinoxes was likely to be accompanied by severe storms.
However, there is no meteorological basis for these so-called
equinoctial storms. Strong storms are common near the equinoxes
since tempests derive their energy from contrasting air masses.
Fierce storms are no more likely at the equinox than on other days
at the seasons' change. Coincidentally, this year a fierce storm
was pounding southern Alaska at the equinox.

   COXNET FOCUS 0319: FOCUS _ In the fall of 1994, President
Clinton confounded his critics by successfully using 20,000
U.S.-led forces to overthrow a brutal military regime here and give
democracy a second chance. Almost no blood was shed and a triumph
in foreign policy was declared. But today, after nearly five years

   HAITI-FLOPS _ PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti _ The history of U.S. aid in
Haiti is peppered with some pretty big flops. But none is more
notorious than the pig fiasco. It started in the late 1970s, when
the United States found swine fever among pigs in the Dominican
Republic, which shares the same island as Haiti. The U.S. Agency
for International Development came up in 1982 with what sounded
like a good plan to ward off the fever in Haiti: Haiti's 1.3
million Creole pigs were destroyed, and were to be replaced with
American stock better suited for export. (The Creole word for
``pig'' and ``bank'' is the same.) Formerly, poor Haitians could
buy a piglet that could eat garbage and scrub and survive in the
heat with little water. When money was needed for a crisis or a
wedding, the ``bank'' could be cashed in. After AID launched its
program, and the Creole pigs were slaughtered, the average Haitian
couldn't afford to buy American pigs or pay for the
vitamin-enriched feed they needed. The result was that they were
worse off than ever before. (Emling, Cox News Service).

House would embrace the reforms. Here's what happened: The panel
was so deeply divided over policy differences that it failed to
adopt a plan, and both sides ascribed partisan politicial motives
for its failure. Here's what's going to happen: The failed plan's

arrest, then back up and tell the story of how he got there.

</P>
<P>
   LONNIEHOLLEY-PART2 _ HARPERSVILLE, Va. _ We look at Holley and
his family and their current troubles. Holley has raised five
children by himself, and by all accounts did a great job against
the odds. But in recent years, his kids have had all manner of
problems. And it could get worse. (Auchmutey, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution) 58.

<P>
   LONNIEH0LLEY-PART3 _ BIRMINGHAM, Ala. _ We look at Holley's
career in the context of the world of folk art. The reasons for
folk artists' struggles are complicated but the results are the
same: renowned, respected artists who wouldn't qualify for an auto
loan. We also look at the efforts of various dealers and do-gooders
to help him and his family. (Auchmutey, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution) 50.

<P>
   LONNIEHOLLEY-PART4 _ We sort out the endings, happy and
otherwise. The first good news, it seemed, Holley had gotten in
years was that juvenile authorities had been so impressed with
Holley's 16-year old son Kubra that they took it upon themselves to
nominate him for the Alabama School of Fine Arts, a magnet program
in Birmingham for gifted children from across the state. While
oldest son Ezekial appears headed for prison, and third son A.J.
for juvenile boot camp. And Holley? He'll probably plead guilty to
reduced charges and get probation, and he's finally painting again.

AMERICA WEST AND FLIGHT ATTENDANTS AVERT STRIKE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ariz., Nev.)  (jw) 
 By LAURENCE ZUCKERMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Averting a strike minutes after a deadline had passed, America
West Airlines and the union representing its 2,300 flight
attendants reached tentative agreement on a contract early
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Details of the five-year agreement were not released but William
McGlashen, president of the local chapter of the Association of
Flight Attendants, said the deal gave workers higher wages and more
flexible work rules.
</P>
<P>
   The contract must be ratified by a majority of union members,
who rejected a settlement in 1997. But Jeff Zack, a spokesman for
the union, said this agreement was far superior to the earlier one,
because it provided a larger raise and an increase in the hourly
payment that flight attendants receive when they are away from
home.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we won't have too much trouble getting this thing
passed,'' Zack said.
</P>
<P>
   America West and the union had been trying to agree on a
contract since 1994, when the flight attendants voted to organize.
After a federal mediator declared the two sides at an impasse last
month, the union threatened to stage a crippling series of random
walkouts if there was no settlement by midnight Friday, the end of
a 30-day cooling off period ordered by the mediator.
</P>
<P>
   The airline responded by threatening to fire any attendant who
took part in a selective strike and, if necessary, to shut down its
operations.
</P>
<P>
   A strike at America West, which is the country's ninth-largest
airline and carried less than 3 percent of the domestic industry's
passengers last year, would not have been as disruptive as last
month's 10-day sickout by pilots at American Airlines, the
country's second-largest carrier. But it would have had a major
impact in Phoenix, where America West is based and dominates the
local airport, and in Las Vegas, where it is the second-largest
carrier.
</P>
<P>
   The main issue was money. America West's flight attendants are
among the lowest-paid in the industry, earning a maximum of $22,000
a year after 12 years on the job. About two-thirds of its
attendants had reached the top pay grade and had not had a raise
since 1995. Since then, the airline, along with the industry, has
had several years of record profits. In 1998, America West
Holdings, the airline's parent company, earned $108 million on $2
billion in sales.
</P>
<P>
   The company offered to raise the flight attendants' pay an
average of 45 percent and to about double the expense payments over
the life of the contract. Going into the final round of
negotiations last week, the two sides were only $16.5 million
apart. The union demanded more money but the company said that it
could not raise its offer and remain competitive.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the two sides compromised and both emerged from the
negotiations satisfied, said a spokesman for the National Mediation
Board, which supervised the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   William Franke, America West's chairman and chief executive,
said in a statement, ``The contract, while very difficult to
negotiate, addresses the principal concerns of both parties.'' He
flew to Washington to take part in the final round of negotiations
and announced the agreement at 2 a.m. Saturday at the National
Mediation Board's headquarters with Patricia Friend, the national
president of the flight attendants union.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The deal spares both sides an expensive and risky battle.
Industry analysts had said that a strike would have cost America
West $2 million to $5 million a day. Already the threat of a strike
had hurt the airline because many travel agents booked advanced
tickets on competitors.
</P>
<P>
   For the union, the settlement avoids a legal test of its
controversial threat to stage random walkouts. The tactic is
designed to have the same impact as a full-fledged strike while
allowing most of the flight attendants to keep working.
</P>
<P>
   The tactic was tried only once, in 1993 at Alaska Airlines, and
a federal court judge held that it was wrong for the airline to
fire flight attendants who took part. But Neil Bernstein, who
teaches labor law at Washington University in St. Louis, said that
such employees could be fired under the National Labor Relations
Act. The issue has never been fully tested in court under the
Railway Labor Act, which governs labor issues in the airline
industry.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, America West filed a lawsuit in Arizona asking a
federal judge to rule on whether it could fire attendants who took
part in intermittent strikes. Stephen L. Johnson, an America West
spokesman, said, ``If the contract is ratified, the lawsuit will be
withdrawn.''

BILL OFFERS COLLEGE OPTIONS TO STUDENTS IN WASHINGTON 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: D.C., Md., Va.)  (jw) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Legislation has been introduced in Congress that
would expand academic options for high school graduates from the
District of Columbia by substantially reducing their tuition fees
at state colleges nationwide and by providing about $2 million for
the local public university.
</P>
<P>
   The bill, written by Rep. Thomas Davis III, R-Va., chairman of a
House subcommittee on the District of Columbia, would allow
students from Washington to qualify for the tuition rate paid by
state residents at public colleges and universities throughout the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   Davis, who has eight co-sponsors for the bill, submitted the
measure to the House on March 4, calling it ``landmark bipartisan
legislation,'' which should move quickly through both houses. The
bill has yet to be introduced in the Senate. It is supported by the
Clinton administration, which included about $15 million for the
program in its budget proposal.
</P>
<P>
   Davis said the bill would be of special help to district
students ``who study hard and work hard and find out-of-state
public colleges out of reach.''
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Anthony Williams, in consultation with the secretary of
education, would administer the program. The bill also provides for
contributions from private donors.
</P>
<P>
   There are more than a dozen private colleges or universities in
Washington, and highly regarded state universities in adjoining
Maryland and Virginia, but the city, which has about 500,000
residents, has only one public university, the University of the
District of Columbia.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of students living in the city, who now pay
out-of-state tuition for attending any public college other than
UDC, could see their tuition at public universities cut by more
than 50 percent. Students from the district paid $7 million in
out-of-state tuition fees last year.
</P>
<P>
   The program would pay the difference between out-of-state and
in-state tuition costs for district students attending state
colleges, so there would be no cost to the universities or colleges
under the program. Students from the district would continue to
have to meet admission requirements.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia Arrington Booker, guidance counselor and college
coordinator for Woodrow Wilson High School in northwest Washington,
said that students were excited about the new options in the
proposed legislation and the possibility of experiencing other
regions of the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had seniors come into my office and add state schools to
their college lists after applications had been sent out,'' Booker
said.
</P>
<P>
   The measure, called The District of Columbia College Access Act,
would also make UDC eligible for annual federal grants by including
it among the colleges designated a historically black college or
university.
</P>
<P>
   But many students still believe that the college is neglected by
the city. The university was forced to shut down for three months
in 1996 because of a lack of money to pay staff members. The school
lost nearly half of its students in the city's budget crisis from
1996 to 1998, when enrollment fell to 4,700 from more than 9,000,
but enrollment rose to 5,284 this year.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Eleanor Holmes Norton, the district's nonvoting delegate in the
House and a co-sponsor of the measure, pressed lawmakers to include
money for the university in the legislation as part of her campaign
for assuring D.C. residents equal status with those who live in the
50 states.
</P>
<P>
   ``Parents and students should not have to move out of town to
attain public higher education options that they can afford for
their children,'' Ms. Norton said.
</P>
<P>
   The bill's sponsors hope it will be an incentive for remaining
in a city that has lost tens of thousands of residents to the
suburbs in the last decade.
</P>
<P>
   ``One-size-fits-all does not work in higher education,'' Ms.
Norton said.

 &HT;    Fans still keeping up with Chipper Jones
 &HT;    By Carroll Rogers
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAKE BUENA VISTA, Fla. _ Phyllis Jobe of Jonesboro, Ga., was an
usher at Atlanta-Fulton County Stadium when she first became a
Chipper Jones fan. From her place in the stands, she would beam at
the young third baseman with the squeaky-clean image, the wide
smile and the hero's persona and joke with her friends that she'd
like her daughter to marry him.
</P>
<P>
   That was before she knew he was married, long before she knew he
was separated. Like thousands this winter, she followed Jones'
offseason saga, when he admitted publicly to having extramarital
affairs, fathering a child out of wedlock and not being the
All-American guy that people thought he was.
</P>
<P>
   When Jobe arrived at the Braves' spring-training complex in
Disney last week, she still looked for Jones. She cheered for him,
as a player, because she's still a fan.
</P>
<P>
   And as a player, Jones hasn't disappointed. His spring
performance has, in fact, been incredible. Going into the weekend,
he was leading the Grapefruit League with a .611 batting average, a
1.222 slugging percentage, and a .750 on-base percentage. He's had
some excellent defensive plays at third base and has hit some
towering home runs, including one off the top of the scoreboard in
left-center at the Braves ballpark at Disney's Wide World of
Sports.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he's still a fantastic ballplayer, and at least he
didn't lie about (his affairs),'' Jobe said. ``Of course, I guess
it's pretty hard to lie when you have a baby. But it hasn't really
decreased my thoughts of how he is as a player. But I was so
excited to see the kids really admire him so much, and that's kind
of bad. That's kind of bad for the kids.''
</P>
<P>
   Jobe's thoughts seem to typify the reaction Jones has received
from fans in spring training. When he arrives at the ballpark in
the morning, he is greeted by autograph-seekers at the players'
entrance. He still goes about his work in batting practice to a
high-pitched chorus of ``Chipper!'' His introduction still draws
the loudest cheers. In games, he's not hearing boos.
</P>
<P>
   The reaction has been much better than Jones had envisioned.
</P>
<P>
   ``I kept picturing something sad,'' Jones said. ``Every time I
think about fans booing a certain player, I think of Boston fans
booing Mo Vaughn. How can you boo Mo Vaughn? The guy's an MVP every
year. He's out in the community helping kids like no one else on
that team.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones figured that if Vaughn could get booed during his contract
negotiation with the Red Sox, then he would be an easy target. So
far he hasn't been.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, that's a big sigh of relief,'' Jones said. ``Granted,
these fans here aren't the fans that are going to be watching us in
Atlanta, but hopefully the reaction will be the same.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones said he gained confidence about his image after visiting
students at Troup County High School in LaGrange in January.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I walked out, everybody was great and supportive,'' Jones
said. ``Everybody in there knows I messed up. I even addressed it
during my talk: `Look I made a huge mistake in my life, but I'm
dealing with it and I'm moving on.'
</P>
<P>
   ``It really made me feel kind of to the point that it never even
happened, that nothing had changed, that everybody's attitude was
still the same. They still looked up to me, and they respected me
for the player I am and for the entertainment I help provide. . . .
It's not going to affect whether or not I play an All-Star third
base. I feel that I'm always going to play that caliber of baseball
out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Baseball has been a good escape, Jones said, and he credits
personal problems for this spring's hot streak.
</P>
<P>
   ``My biggest fear was that I'd come down here this spring, not
play that well, and people would think that it was affecting me,''
Jones said. ``I didn't want that to happen. So I was more intense
in my workouts this offseason and more intense down here. And
things have worked out. Hopefully, that will dispel anybody's fears
of what has happened affecting the way I play.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones said he was surprised that he managed to keep all but one
of his endorsement deals. Wendy's dropped him within a month or so
of his public admission.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I'd lose them all,'' Jones said. ``It really kind of
fired me up when people came back to me and said, `Hey, we're
sticking with you. You've gone through a tough time. Yeah, you made
a mistake, and you're struggling, but we've got faith in you.'''
</P>
<P>
   Jones knows he'll face a tougher test when he returns to Turner
Field for exhibition games on April 2-3 and Opening Day on April 5.
</P>
<P>
   ``If (reaction) is mixed or dominantly one way or the other,
it's not going to crush me,'' he said. ``I feel that if I go out
there, and I'm the same player I've always been, and I still
provide the same excitement out there, (the problems) eventually
will get behind me. People may not forget about it, but maybe
they'll look past it. I'm not a bad guy by any means. I just messed
up. I've asked for people's forgiveness. If they give it to me,
great _ `I love you.' If they don't, I understand.''
</P>
<P>
   For fans like Jobe, that might be enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't say I'll never forgive him, because I don't have
anything to forgive,'' Jobe said. ``But I really looked up to him a
lot as a player, especially for our young children. But maybe
that's just life. Maybe that's just what children need, is to know
that people are not perfect. And you shouldn't hold them in such
high esteem because we're all human and we all make mistakes. Some
mistakes we have to pay for longer.''

DUTCH COURT TO HEAR FIGHT FOR CONTROL OVER GUCCI 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By JOHN TAGLIABUE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROME _ The high-stakes, high-drama struggle for control of
Italy's fabled Gucci fashion house goes back to a Dutch court on
Monday, after the French luxury-goods maker LVMH Moet Hennessy
Louis Vuitton SA said it would seek to invalidate a deal Gucci
struck on Friday to sell 40 percent of its shares to one of
France's wealthiest takeover investors.
</P>
<P>
   LVMH, which makes Louis Vuitton leather goods and Moet &AMP; Chandon
champagne, will argue that the deal is meant to foil the designs of
LVMH to seize control of Gucci. In the French company's view, this
violates a ruling this month by the Dutch court that the two
companies negotiate a compromise in their 2-month-old struggle.
</P>
<P>
   The battle between Gucci, the fashion house founded by the
Florentine family of the same name, and LVMH, the creation of
Bernard Arnault, one of France's most successful industrialists, is
outdoing dramatic opera for its plot twists, intrigues and
ambitions.
</P>
<P>
   It took a fresh turn on Friday, when Gucci said Francois
Pinault, a self-made billionaire whose mixed holdings include the
French Au Printemps department-store chain and London's famed
Christie's auction house, had agreed to pay $3 billion for a 40
percent stake in Gucci.
</P>
<P>
   Gucci said Pinault had also bought for $1 billion the French
drug maker Sanofi's beauty-products brands, including Yves Saint
Laurent, Krizia and Kenzo, with an eye to bringing them into Gucci.
</P>
<P>
   Gucci's surprise move was clearly intended to enlist Pinault as
a white knight to foil Arnault. The latter Frenchman has been
seeking control of Gucci since January, when he announced that he
had assembled a 34.4 percent stake in the Italian fashion house.
Gucci is potentially the second-biggest global luxury-goods group
after LVMH.
</P>
<P>
   For many in the luxury-goods business, the struggle has been
indicative of the way the business will change in the next few
years, as hot niche brands are absorbed by big groups that can
compete around the world.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Arnault initially responded by doing something he had
previously said he would never do, making a bid for all outstanding
Gucci shares, at a cost of about $5 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The bid not only exposed Arnault's weakness _ on Thursday he had
said a full bid for Gucci was ``too risky'' _ but also confronted
Gucci with a difficult choice. On Sunday, the day before the court
hearing, Gucci's board is meeting the company's chief executive,
Domenico De Sole, to discuss options.
</P>
<P>
   In effect, they are several. Gucci can reaffirm the deal with
Pinault, or overturn it and accept Arnault's counteroffer. That
move could, however, provoke a damage suit from Pinault. The board
could also postpone a decision until the court in the Netherlands,
where Gucci is incorporated, meets on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Any decision the board takes would ultimately be subject to
shareholder approval. Among the shareholders are De Sole and Tom
Ford, Gucci's creative director, and they clearly favor Pinault's
offer, considering that of Arnault a possible ruse. Although
Arnault has bid $85 a share, well beyond Pinault's $75-per-share
bid, Arnault's offer was made contingent on Gucci's backing out of
the deal with Pinault.
</P>
<P>
   Pierre Gode, a close associate of Arnault, accused De Sole of
duplicity.
</P>
<P>
   While De Sole claimed to resist LVMH's advances in order to save
Gucci from French hands, he negotiated at the same time to give
control of Gucci to a competing French group. And while De Sole had
in the past accused LVMH of bad faith for refusing to make a full
bid, it now agreed to Pinault's taking control with only 40
percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``He speaks with a double tongue,'' Gode said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The dramatic aspects of the struggle are rooted in the
personalities of the two main antagonists. Both Pinault and Arnault
are keen art collectors and connoisseurs of great wines; they also
share the reputation of being savvy but ruthless businessmen.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that, the similarities pale. Arnault is a graduate of the
prestigious Ecole Polytechnique and learned his financial craft
from Antoine Bernheim, of the influential Lazard Freres investment
bank; Pinault is a high school dropout who parlayed his father's
lumber business into what is by some estimates France's largest
private fortune, worth $7 billion.

JULE EISENBUD, PSYCHIATRIST AND PARAPSYCHOLOGY RESEARCHER, DIES
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Colo., N.Y.)   (jw) 
 By NICK RAVO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dr. Jule Eisenbud, a psychiatrist, author and researcher best
known for his interest in parapsychology, died on March 10 in
Denver. He was 90.
</P>
<P>
   Eisenbud did research in many areas of psychiatry,
psychoanalysis, anthropology and hypnosis during his career, but he
came to prominence largely through his book ``The World of Ted
Serios'' (William Morrow &AMP; Co., 1967). In it, he described his work
with Serios, a Chicago bellhop, who claimed to produce
``thoughtographs,'' dream-like images of his thoughts, on film.
</P>
<P>
   The work brought Eisenbud wide public attention and some
ridicule. It was criticized in a review in The New York Times by
H.J. Eysenck, a professor of psychology at the University of London
and the author of a dozen books, including ``Sense and Nonsense in
Psychology.'' Eysenck wrote, ``Dr. Eisenbud seems to have little
notion of what experiments are and less liking for the rigors and
methodological niceties of scientific research.''
</P>
<P>
   Patrice Keane, executive director of the American Society for
Psychical Research in New York, said that Eisenbud's professional
standing helped shield him from the sting of such criticism.
</P>
<P>
   Jule Eisenbud was born in New York on Nov. 20, 1908. He received
bachelor's and medical degrees from Columbia University.
</P>
<P>
   In 1938, he began private practice in psychiatry and
psychoanalysis. In 1950, he moved to Denver with his family, where
he continued his practice and became associate clinical professor
of psychiatry at the University of Colorado Medical School.
</P>
<P>
   Eisenbud's wife, Molly, died in 1995. He is survived by two
sons, John and Dr. Eric Eisenbud, and a daughter, Joanna Moldow,
all of Denver, as well as five grandchildren and one
great-grandchild.

<TEXT>
<P>
   GENEVA _ Bertrand Piccard and Brian Jones sailed into history
Saturday when their Breitling Orbiter 3 completed the first nonstop
balloon trip around the world _ a goal many had sought but never
achieved.
</P>
<P>
   At 4:54 a.m. EST, at an altitude of 36,000 feet, the balloon
sped past the finish line at longitude 9 degrees 27 minutes west in
Mauritania, the longitude from which they began their 20-day
voyage. The harrowing trip had taken the pilots over Europe,
Africa, Asia, the Pacific Ocean, Central America and the Atlantic
Ocean.
</P>
<P>
   When the pilots crossed the finish line, their mission control
team at Geneva airport broke into cheers and sprayed a forest of
news television cameras with champagne.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am with the angels and just completely happy,'' Piccard told
them by satellite telephone after attaining one of aviation's most
elusive goals.
</P>
<P>
   His partner, Jones, asked by the crew whether they were
celebrating their achievement, replied, ``The first thing I'll do
is phone my wife, and then, like the good Englishman I am, I'll
have a cup of tea.''
</P>
<P>
   Piccard, who comes from a long line of accomplished scientific
adventurers, added that he felt that an ``invisible hand'' had
guided the balloon along its ``fantastic voyage.''
</P>
<P>
   After flying over the equally invisible finish point, the
Breitling pilots decided to continue on for another day at high
speed, intending to land in Egypt on Sunday morning.
</P>
<P>
   (After the balloon took off on March 1 from Chateau-d`Oex in the
Swiss Alps, the pilots initially flew southwest to North Africa to
catch a favorable jet stream going eastward. The official beginning
of their trip was therefore the westernmost point the balloon
reached before heading east).
</P>
<P>
   Before reaching Egypt, the balloon is expected to fly over
Libya, a nation that has sometimes barred balloonists from its
airspace.
</P>
<P>
   ``But for us, Libya has been extremely helpful and
cooperative,'' said Alan Noble, an English balloonist and engineer
who was the team's flight director. He said the Breitling Orbiter
3's lifting gas would cool Saturday night and the balloon would be
allowed to descend slowly to the ground on Sunday morning, provided
all continues to go well.
</P>
<P>
   A team is waiting to pick up the two aeronauts. With more than
one day's supply of propane fuel still aboard, the balloonists said
they would try to reach the Nile desert before landing just after
dawn on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   They had hoped to set down near the Pyramids in Cairo, but the
winds will take them too far south, their meteorologists said.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, the Swiss Post Office announced Saturday that on
Wednesday it would issue a commemorative stamp honoring the
balloon.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from establishing the greatest record in ballooning
history, the Breitling's crew has met the requirement by which they
will receive $1 million from the Anheuser-Busch brewing company, as
well as the Budweiser Cup, offered to the first balloonist to
circumnavigate the earth without landing.
</P>
<P>
   Piccard, a medical doctor and psychiatrist, said that it would
be sad to part with the balloon, which will never be used again,
and that the entire Breitling crew would now have to adjust to a
change in lifestyle. He thanked Breitling, a Swiss manufacturer of
watches, for its support over the last five years, which included
three attempts to circle the world.
</P>
<P>
   The precise cost of long-duration balloons is never publicly
announced, but the Breitling Orbiter 3, built by Cameron Balloons
Ltd. of Bristol, England, is known to have cost about $2 million _
a sum that did not include salaries for a 13-member ground staff
and many other expenses.
</P>
<P>
   In the grip of a powerful jet stream, the balloon was traveling
at about 130 mph Saturday when it passed high over the finishing
point.
</P>
<P>
   Noble said that Egyptian helicopters were prepared to pick up
Piccard and Jones and that their gondola might be retrieved by
truck.
</P>
<P>
   Normally, the balloon carrying the gondola is ripped apart when
the craft lands, and it is expected that nothing will be left of
the Breitling Orbiter 3 but the gondola that housed the crew for 20
long days.
</P>
<P>
   The flight of the Breitling Orbiter 3 was a triumph of piloting
skill, helped by steady improvements in balloon technology over the
years and superb meteorological forecasting. Without this, the
balloon could not have threaded its way around storms, mountain
peaks, hostile airspace, unruly winds, stagnant air and other
hazards.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was like a jigsaw puzzle,'' Noble said, ``and finally we
managed to pull it all together.''
</P>
<P>
   The danger of drifting over unfriendly territory is no idle
hazard. Balloonists were stunned in 1995 when two Americans taking
part in the James Gordon Bennett annual balloon race drifted from
Poland into Belarus, where they were shot down and killed by a
Belarusian helicopter.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, long-duration balloonists have tried hard to get
overflight permission from all countries over which they might fly,
but have not always succeeded.
</P>
<P>
   China and Russia have been reluctant to admit balloonists. The
Breitling team was permitted into Chinese airspace this time, but
only on condition that their craft remain south of the 26th
parallel. It sometimes drifted to within 20 miles of this invisible
boundary, eliciting warnings from Chinese radar controllers.
</P>
<P>
   Since they have no power of their own, balloons are at the mercy
of whatever winds they encounter. High-altitude jet-stream winds
flow at speeds up to 200 mph in a generally west-to-east track
around the world. But jet streams may halt or divide into branches
without warning, sometimes carrying a balloon far off course.
</P>
<P>
   However, there are many low-speed wind circulation patterns at
lower altitudes, and by maneuvering between altitudes, skillful
balloonists aided by competent meteorology of ground teams can
generally find a wind going their way.
</P>
<P>
   This allows a balloon to change lanes, so to speak, picking a
direction that avoids hazards and leads into an appropriate jet
stream. Advanced computer modeling of the earth's hour-to-hour wind
patterns, coupled with observations by satellites, commercial
airliners, ships and other sources, allows ground-based
meteorologists to guide balloonists with great accuracy.

   Many modern balloons are equipped with autopilots, allowing
their crews to sleep. An autopilot monitors a balloon's altitude,
automatically firing the craft's hot-air burners as needed to
maintain the constant height. But this is only for periods when
course changes are not needed, and most pilots are awake most of
the time.
</P>
<P>
   Piccard said he frequently had trouble getting to sleep during
the three-week flight, and at one point used auto-hypnosis to doze
off. He had learned the technique as part of his medical practice.
</P>
<P>
   The triumph of the Breitling Orbiter 3 culminated a competition
between rival balloon teams that became fiercer each year.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Newman, Richard Branson, Per Lindstrand, Steve Fossett,
Maxie Anderson and many other world-class balloonists have all
tried for the great prize of circling the globe _ and all have
failed.
</P>
<P>
   After his third failed attempt in 1982, Anderson remarked that
it was time to leave further attempts to a new generation of
balloonists.
</P>
<P>
   The Piccard team is the new generation.
</P>
<P>
   During the 1990s, many balloon teams vied to be first around the
world, and their craft became ever more complex and costly.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the recent competitors have bought their rigs from
Cameron Balloons, whose British owner, Don Cameron, is himself a
champion balloonist. His major competitor, Per Lindstrand, a
Swedish balloon maker whose plant is in Wales, built only one of
this year's major balloon in the round-the-world competition _ the
ICO Global Challenge, piloted by Branson, Lindstrand and Fossett.
The ICO balloon, which started in Morocco, ran out of fuel and
ditched near Hawaii last Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   The top contenders during the past year included Fossett, a
wealthy American commodities broker with an urge to excel in many
sports: yachting, mountain climbing, swimming, dog-sled racing and
ballooning.
</P>
<P>
   He has generally preferred competing solo, rather than as a team
member, and all but the most recent of his balloon flights were
made alone.
</P>
<P>
   By flying alone in an unpressurized gondola, lacking almost all
amenities, Fossett attracted a large following of admirers. But on
his solo attempt last year, when he tried to avoid Northern
Hemisphere countries hostile to balloonists, he flew over the
Southern Hemisphere and was forced down in a storm at sea in which
he was nearly killed.
</P>
<P>
   After that, Branson, the billionaire chairman of the group of
companies that includes Virgin Atlantic Airways, invited him as a
crew member of his own balloon. That flight ended in the Pacific
last Dec. 25.
</P>
<P>
   Other competitors in the last year, some of which failed even to
get into the air, were the British Cable &AMP; Wireless balloon (which
set an endurance record now eclipsed by the Breitling balloon), the
Spirit of Peace, the World Quest, the RE/Max Explorer (a huge
balloon that would have been kept aloft on helium alone) and the J.
Rene flown by another solo balloonist, Kevin Uliassi.
</P>
<P>
   In the wings, but unable to finish their balloon projects for
lack of money, were Julian Nott, a champion British balloonist, and
Henk Brink, a Dutch balloonist and helicopter pilot.
</P>
<P>
   Now that a round-the-world flight has succeeded, the competition
has ended, and few balloonists are likely to try for a lesser goal.
Nevertheless, members of the International Aeronautical Federation
have expressed hopes of organizing round-the-world balloon races.
</P>
<P>
   Fellow balloonists were jubilant about the Breitling's success.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was an enormous cheer when we heard that they had
crossed the line,'' said Cameron, whose company built the
history-making balloon. ``There is a certain amount of champagne
being drunk here.''
</P>
<P>
   Branson, who made four failed attempts to circle the globe, told
SKY television in London, ``It is a magnificent achievement, and
two delightful people have achieved it.''
</P>
<P>
   Fossett also saluted the Breitling Orbiter team _ with a hint of
regret.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're a competitor you run the risk of not winning, but
I'm very happy for Piccard and Jones,'' he told The Associated
Press. ``I think it's one of the greatest achievements in aviation.
Even though it was the first form of flight, it's the last type of
aircraft to fly around the world. And there's a great romance to
making a first around the world of any type.''
</P>
<P>
   President Ruth Dreifuss of Switzerland also congratulated the
team. In a telegram addressed to Piccard, she noted that he was
successful on his third attempt to go around the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``This time you won your bet, and the world is your witness,''
she said. ``It is a success for technology, but also the
realization of a a dream that many children _ and adults _ have
shared with you.''

 LAWMAKERS GET AWAY FROM CAPITAL FOR LESSON IN BEING NICE (Eds:
Updates with new material.)  
(jw) 
 By FRANK BRUNI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HERSHEY, Pa. _ During fights on the House floor, they have
plenty of opportunity to snipe. During committee hearings, they
have ample occasion to seethe.
</P>
<P>
   But in this candy-coated realm of chocolate kisses, members of
Congress had a rare chance this weekend to do something different.
They got to share.
</P>
<P>
   Descending on a rambling lodge and conference center for what
was billed as a three-day course in civility, nearly 200
Republicans and Democrats, some with their spouses and children in
tow, came together to exercise their diplomacy and exorcize their
demons, primarily in small discussion groups that were meant,
according to organizers, to provide ``safe environments'' for the
venting of feelings.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers listened on Friday afternoon to a keynote speech by
John Hume, a Nobel-winning architect of peace in Northern Ireland,
on the theory that anyone who could soothe the tensions there might
be able to do as much for Ways and Means.
</P>
<P>
   They were scheduled Saturday for line dancing at a Family
Country Hoedown, on the theory that if they could kick up their
heels together, then maybe _ just maybe _ they could break the
impasse over Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   These were lofty goals indeed, but not, participants insisted,
beyond all reach.
</P>
<P>
   Reflecting on Hume's remarks, which alluded to the Northern
Ireland accord, Rep. Richard Neal, D-Mass., said, ``The odds that
he faced getting the Good Friday agreement were clearly more
difficult than the odds we face here.''
</P>
<P>
   The bipartisan retreat, from Friday to Sunday, was a reprise of
a similar gathering here two years ago, but lawmakers conceded that
this one came at an even more difficult moment, on the heels of the
impeachment ordeal.
</P>
<P>
   Their presence here seemed to signal both a genuine desire for
some degree of reconciliation and a genuine concern about their
everyday estrangement from each other.
</P>
<P>
   As they boarded a chartered train leaving Union Station in
Washington on Friday morning and as they took breaks from their
scheduled activities here Friday and Saturday, they spoke ruefully
of the frenetic pace in Congress these days and the impersonal
atmosphere around Washington, where they said fewer and fewer
lawmakers were anchoring their family and social lives.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Jack Quinn, R-N.Y., said between events that there was an
incalculable benefit to ``getting to know someone over a tuna fish
sandwich and a Pepsi instead of a minimum wage agreement.''
</P>
<P>
   But the failure of a majority of House members to come to
Hershey, the self-christened ``sweetest place on earth,''
underlined a feeling among many that all they would get here were
empty calories. Several of them said the event was a futile
charade, more useful for public relations than political harmony.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see the point,'' said Rep. Jim McDermott, D-Wash., who
stayed away. In a telephone interview on the eve of the retreat,
McDermott said that if Republicans were really interested in
rapprochement, they would not have been so stingy in awarding
committee assignments to Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think in some place in the Bible, it says that by your deeds
you shall be known,'' McDermott said.
</P>
<P>
   Following reports earlier this week that many more Republicans
than Democrats would show up, organizers declined Saturday to
provide a list of participants and were hazy about the overall
attendance figure, which they said was almost evenly divided
between the two parties.
</P>
<P>
   Reporters were relegated to the periphery of the conference
center and details of the schedule were kept under wraps, but this
being Congress, there were any number of leaks, revealing an
itinerary rife with items that had an ambiguous connection to
civility and healing.
</P>
<P>
   After a Friday night event at which the actor Sam Waterston
performed his reportedly uncanny imitation of Abraham Lincoln,
early risers could attend an aerobics workout at 6:45 Saturday
morning led by Sandie Knollenberg, the wife of Rep. Joe
Knollenberg, R-Mich.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday afternoon was set aside for diversion and relaxation,
with lawmakers and their families choosing among such options as a
journey to Gettysburg, a trip to the chocolate museum, high tea at
the Hotel Hershey and a skating exhibition known as World on Ice.
That was all leading up to the hoedown, where the kind of
iridescent necklaces popular at circuses would be scattered around
the tables as a festive icebreaker. (Two years ago, it was hula
hoops.)
</P>
<P>
   Organizers said that none of this strayed from the retreat's
purpose of fostering greater civility in Congress. A common refrain
was that once a lawmaker had seen a colleague from across the aisle
changing a toddler's diaper, it would be harder for him or her to
summarily demonize the other side.
</P>
<P>
   ``When all is said and done, relationships count,'' said Rep.
James Rogan, R-Calif., who had been among the prosecutors of
President Clinton during his Senate trial.
</P>
<P>
   Rogan was taking a break from the discussion groups, each
consisting of about 20 to 25 lawmakers and spouses along with a
trained ``facilitator,'' to meet reporters at their request in a
nearby restaurant. He beckoned them into a circular booth too small
to accommodate everyone.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to get you all close to me,'' he joked, ``because I'm
missing my group hug for the minute.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Although Rogan and other lawmakers who emerged from the
conference center were mum about the specific content of the
dialogues inside, they said that Democrats and Republicans were
sharing grievances, hopes and personal stories in an informal
manner that would be unusual on Capitol Hill.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Tom Sawyer, D-Ohio, one of the principal organizers of the
retreat, said Saturday afternoon, ``The most compelling thing so
far, given what we have been through in the last year, is how
constructive everything has been.''
</P>
<P>
   That boded well for a wish that Rep. Joseph Crowley, D-N.Y.,
expressed at the start of the event.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope that at the end of this weekend,'' he said with a
smile, ``I can lay a big Hershey's kiss on a Republican, preferably
female.''

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ray Forrest, who worked for many years at his family's jewelry
store in Paterson, N.J., died March 11 at a hospital near his home
in Kinnelon, N.J. He was 83 and all but forgotten as the man who
became a hero to hundreds in 1939 as the nation's first television
personality.
</P>
<P>
   If Forrest is better remembered among older New York television
viewers for the acclaimed educational program ``Children's
Theater,'' which he produced and hosted for WNBC-TV from 1949 to
1960, there is a reason his earlier work has been virtually
forgotten.
</P>
<P>
   At the time he became the most visible presence on television,
there were fewer than 1,000 television sets in existence.
</P>
<P>
   Wearing a tuxedo to intone the formal sign-on when NBC went on
the air each evening, Forrest announced every station break and
every program. There he was, covering wrestling, boxing, hockey,
horse racing and movie premieres; interviewing men and women on the
street; introducing dramatic productions; serving as quiz show
announcer and variety show host and even becoming the network's
first full-time news anchor (after Lowell Thomas, whose radio news
had been simulcast on television, decided to do his broadcasts from
his upstate home).
</P>
<P>
   Forrest, then a 23-year-old junior radio announcer at NBC, was
not present at the opening of the New York World's Fair on April
30, 1939, when President Franklin D. Roosevelt and David Sarnoff,
the president of the Radio Corporation of America, NBC's parent,
inaugurated regular television programming with a broadcast over
NBC's experimental station, W2XBS.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, for months the station employed no announcers,
recruiting them as the occasional need arose from NBC's radio
staff, a process that so irritated the radio network's crusty chief
of announcers that by the fall he had persuaded the station to stop
pestering him and take on one of his six junior announcers full
time.
</P>
<P>
   Forrest won the job, and for the next two and a half years
almost every time he opened his mouth he made television history.
</P>
<P>
   He was the on-board announcer for the first airborne telecast,
from a U.S. plane flying low over New York City on March 6, 1940,
and later that year he was the NBC announcer at the first televised
political convention, in Philadelphia, where the Republicans
nominated Wendell Willkie. (CBS, which was racking up some firsts
of its own, broadcast the convention in color.)
</P>
<P>
   The next year it was Forrest who read the formal announcement on
camera when W2XBS, newly licensed by the Federal Communications
Commission and renamed WNBT (it later became WNBC), ushered in the
era of commercial television on July 1, 1941.
</P>
<P>
   The first commercial, a film showing a ticking Bulova watch,
used no announcer, but three days later, on July 4, Forrest did the
first live television commercial, for Adam hats, a chore that
earned him no sponsor's fee unless you count the hat. Forrest got
to keep it.
</P>
<P>
   Later that year Forrest apparently became the first television
announcer to break into a program with a news bulletin,
interrupting a Sunday afternoon movie, ``The Playboy'' with Harry
Richman, to announce that the Japanese had bombed Pearl Harbor.
</P>
<P>
   For Forrest, a native of Germany who came to the United States
with his family in 1923 and got his broadcasting start at 20 with a
job in the NBC mail room in 1936, those were heady days.
</P>
<P>
   But World War II interrupted both the development of television
and his own career, and by the time he returned from service in
1946, television was in the midst of its postwar boom and he was no
longer the only kid on the block.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he was almost as busy as ever, among other things serving
as the announcer for ``In the Kelvinator Kitchen,'' an early
cooking show, in 1947, and as the announcer and eventually the host
of ``TV Screen Magazine,'' one of the first television magazine
shows, in 1948 and 1949.
</P>
<P>
   Then he was asked to produce and be the host of ``Children's
Theater,'' and Forrest made what he regarded as his most important
contribution to television.
</P>
<P>
   Dismayed by plans to have him introduce Hollywood comedy shorts
that he found full of racial stereotypes and sexual innuendo,
Forrest obtained grudging permission to use high-quality science
and nature films, but was warned he would lose his audience within
two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, as he recalled in ``The Box,'' an oral history of
television compiled by Jeff Kisseloff and published by Viking in
1995, the ratings shot up, and within months he dominated his 6:30
p.m. weekday slot.
</P>
<P>
   Although it drew reams of appreciative mail from parents, the
program attracted no sponsors, and after a couple of years it was
canceled, drawing such an outpouring of protests it was immediately
reinstated as a 90-minute Saturday morning fixture, and Forrest was
off and running again, turning the basement of his Ridgewood, N.J.,
home into a one-man production studio, where he edited educational
films, including many he made himself.
</P>
<P>
   When the program went off the air in 1960, Forrest, whose
original name was Feuerstein, joined the family jewelry business,
content that he had done his duty by creating the first truly
educational program.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife, Charlotte; a son, Ray Jr. of
Franklin Lakes, N.J., and two granddaughters.

SERBS PRESS OFFENSIVE AS MONITORS LEAVE KOSOVO 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: SUBS to emphasize stepped-up violence; SUBS overline.)

<P>
   GORNJA KLINA, Yugoslavia _ Kosovo was convulsed with violence
Saturday after some 1,300 foreign monitors withdrew to neighboring
Macedonia and Serbian security forces took advantage of their
absence to press an offensive against ethnic Albanian rebels.
Thousands of panicked refugees fled on foot, by tractor or horse
and cart.
</P>
<P>
   These were people who had already abandoned their villages
earlier this week for the comparative safety of Srbica, a town in
the Drenica region that is the heartland of the Kosovo Albanians'
revolt against Serbian rule. Now, trudging through snow and
bone-chilling cold, they were fleeing again, seeking safety deeper
inside rebel-held territory.
</P>
<P>
   Burly policemen in dark blue camouflage uniforms, equipped with
flak jackets and pistols in their belts, blocked access to most
reporters seeking to get into Srbica. Those journalists who did
manage to enter the small town described groups of gunmen, in white
snow-camouflage and black masks, driving around the settlement, and
tanks and armored vehicles ranged in positions throughout the town.
</P>
<P>
   The policemen outside Srbica waved through a convoy of armored
jeeps, and police personnel carriers and a water truck, clad with
crude metal sheets of armor, machine guns poking out of small slit
windows. There was no other traffic on the road.
</P>
<P>
   In recent days, Srbica's population had swollen with some 5,000
refugees from outlying villages. On Saturday, the town itself was
under attack.
</P>
<P>
   Shell fire resounded in the hills and three houses in the town
were in flames. A firefight was under way in the village of
Poljance, which lies just south of Srbica and until Friday was
under the control of fighters of the separatist Kosovo Liberation
Army.
</P>
<P>
   It was just hours after the foreign monitors with the
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe had evacuated
to neighboring Macedonia. Their withdrawal followed the collapse of
peace talks Friday in Paris and increased NATO threats of punitive
air strikes against Serbia for refusing to negotiate peace on
foreign terms.
</P>
<P>
   Even as monitors left, in a coordinated motorcade of bright
orange vehicles to the border, they watched large numbers of
Yugoslav army soldiers on the move.
</P>
<P>
   ``They made signs, they blew kisses. They are pleased to see us
go,'' said one monitor, speaking of the soldiers on condition of
anonymity. He had driven out from Pec, in western Kosovo, and
passed a large column of armor headed the other way. There was also
heavy military activity around the main army base outside Kosovo's
capital, Pristina, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are glad to see the back of us so they can finish the
job,'' the monitor said. ``They have a window of opportunity with
the weather and they are going to put the squeeze on.'' Kosovo lay
coated in snow and beneath low clouds, and the roads were thick
with ice Saturday _ not good weather for NATO to bomb, the monitor
pointed out.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, President Clinton warned the Serbs that they had
crossed the threshold of acceptable behavior. Nonessential foreign
diplomats and their families began to leave Belgrade, the capital
of Yugoslavia, which consists of Serbia and Montenegro. NATO's
secretary-general, Javier Solana, and other foreign leaders warned
the Serbs that air strikes could come within days.
</P>
<P>
   But neither those warnings nor the weather deterred the Serbian
police and Yugoslav army Saturday, as they pressed their offensive
against the Kosovo Liberation Army, the rebel force that first
challenged Serbian rule last spring.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The Kosovo Liberation Army _ financed by the Albanian diaspora
and backed by the heavily ethnic Albanian population of this
southern Serbian province _ has grown in the past year from a
ragtag force to a far more uniformed and disciplined group
increasingly equipped with sophisticated weapons as well as the
standard Kalashnikov rifle.
</P>
<P>
   But those weapons are still no match for the heavy armor of the
Serbs. On Saturday, tanks were ranged in firing position and
mortars set up along the road looking south over the villages in
the Cicavica mountain range.
</P>
<P>
   Police manned a new position, and aimed their guns out from
newly constructed sandbagged defenses. Columns of troop trucks and
army artillery guns were drawn up in organized groups beside the
road.
</P>
<P>
   Farther north, the main road to Belgrade was cut by fighting.
Police said the rebels had attacked a police station at Luzane
Friday evening. That could not be independently confirmed, but
shooting and shelling continued much of Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Since October, the 1,300 foreign monitors who left Saturday have
kept a check on army and police movements, trailing military
convoys and watching their exercises and operations. While they
were not able to force them to keep to barracks, the presence of
the monitors appeared to have a restraining effect.
</P>
<P>
   As the foreigners left, many ethnic Albanians said they feared
what the Serbs would now do. A woman who gave her name only as Sofi
was walking back to her house on the outskirts of Gornja Klina, to
bring food to her husband and sons.
</P>
<P>
   She had fled the village when shells landed in the area on
Monday. She had heard that the monitors were leaving and said she
now wanted to persuade her husband to abandon the house.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a lot of fear, everyone feels it,'' she said. ``When
we fled the OSCE was there, they helped us. But now I do not know
what will happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of the monitors expressed unhappiness at leaving, even
though their job as unarmed monitors had been increasingly
frustrating.
</P>
<P>
   William Walker, the American head of the verification mission in
Kosovo, acknowledged the problem. ``None of us are happy,'' he
said. ``All of us would want to stay.'' He added that the mission
was now redundant, and that he hoped the monitors' withdrawal would
help break the current deadlock.

SPORTS COLUMN: THE DRAW COULD TURN INTO A KNOCKOUT AFTER ALL 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By DAVE ANDERSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Like any title fight, it was supposed to be over
after 12 rounds, but with all the commotion over the debatable draw
between Evander Holyfield and Lennox Lewis, it's as if it were now
scheduled for 12 weeks, if not 12 months or more. That might be how
long its implications will be examined in Washington and in the
Manhattan district attorney's office.
</P>
<P>
   But if boxing's political and promotional structure eventually
is changed for the better because of the outcry, the debatable draw
will have been worth more to boxing than all the lore of the
Thrilla in Manila or The Long Count.
</P>
<P>
   Unless evidence of criminal bribery in the judging of the
debatable draw is uncovered by the district attorney's office, the
vote for Lewis by the South African judge, the vote for Holyfield
by the American judge and the vote for a draw by the British judge
are no longer relevant. You can't indict an honest opinion.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout its history, boxing has had a wildly unpopular
decision every so often. As long as humans are the judges, it
always will.
</P>
<P>
   The real value of the debatable draw is that it has drawn
attention to the Muhammad Ali Boxing Reform Act, a bill introduced
by Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz. It was approved unanimously in the
Senate last Oct. 8, but there has been no companion legislation in
the House of Representatives.
</P>
<P>
   Boxing's pirates, alias its promoters, notably Don King and Bob
Arum, have known that they can never be accused of breaking any of
boxing's laws because there are virtually no laws.
</P>
<P>
   But if the Ali Act were to become law, boxing promoters and
officials of the worldwide alphabet soup of title-sanctioning
bodies would be subject to jail time and substantial fines.
</P>
<P>
   The bill's key provisions include limiting a promoter's now
virtually limitless option clauses to one year, requiring a
promoter to file a fighter's complete contract rather than a
quickie form, prohibiting a promoter from coercing a fighter to
hire a promoter's relative as a manager, and requiring public
financial disclosure from the alphabet-soup bodies.
</P>
<P>
   Home Box Office, which is just as much a promoter as King or
Arum, has a six-bout contract with Lewis. Did that have any
influence on HBO's supposedly objective commentators' support of
Lewis throughout the debatable draw?
</P>
<P>
   In a New York Senate Committee hearing last Thursday, King
acknowledged that his son, Carl, managed ``several'' fighters. And
for all of King's insistence under oath that ``I stay clear of all
judges,'' he was not interrogated about his relationships,
financially or otherwise, with the World Boxing Council, World
Boxing Association and International Boxing Federation presidents
who appoint judges.
</P>
<P>
   ``Professional boxers and the integrity of the sport,'' McCain
told the committee in a statement, ``would be far better served by
competitive bidding among promoters for major events.''
</P>
<P>
   The senator also targeted the ratings systems by the
alphabet-soup groups as having ``no credibility or consistency; a
boxer's rating is often manipulated to suit the particular whims of
a particular promoter or the organization's own bottom line.''
Holyfield, for example, is ignored in the WBC ratings; Lewis is
ignored in the WBA and IBF ratings.
</P>
<P>
   ``That the Holyfield-Lewis judges were, in effect, chosen to
represent the different ratings groups,'' the senator pointed out,
``shows how deeply entrenched conflicts of interest are.''
</P>
<P>
   The senator was in a ringside seat a week ago for the debatable
draw, but his credibility as a boxing reformist predated the boos
that thundered throughout Madison Square Garden.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, along with Sen. Richard Bryan, D-Nev., sponsored the
Professional Boxing Safety Act, the 1996 law that prevents a
fighter with a revoked or suspended license in one state from being
licensed by another state. That law kept Mike Tyson from fighting
elsewhere after Nevada revoked his license for biting Holyfield's
ears.
</P>
<P>
   According to McCain, the Ali Act does not require taxpayer funds
or the creation of government bureaucracies. But it does require
the House of Representatives to introduce it and then approve it
for President Clinton's signature as law.
</P>
<P>
   When and if that happens, the Holyfield-Lewis heavyweight
championship unification bout will have resulted in a knockout
after all _ a knockout of the pervasive power of the promoters and
the alphabet-soup governing bodies that have infected boxing for
too long.

SPORTS COLUMN: WINNING IS LESS IMPORTANT ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE
STREET
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By   ROBERT LIPSYTE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ ``Where I come from,'' growled Jennifer Llaneras, a
14-year-old artist and shortstop from East Harlem, ``girls are
supposed to be china dolls and stay on shelves. Not me. I'm here to
play, not be displayed.''
</P>
<P>
   Confident in her exit line, Llaneras swaggered out onto the gym
floor last week and began throwing a softball hard enough to make
leather complain. She glanced over her shoulder only twice to check
audience response. Her coach smiled and mouthed, ``Attitude.'' He
liked that. He might have a team this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Softball is a nice release,'' said the team captain, Meta
Duevell, an 18-year-old photographer from Brooklyn who plays first
base and bats clean-up. ``The people across the street may have it
harder, but we have a reason to be here, too. We want to do
something, not just sit around. And Jake makes it fun.''
</P>
<P>
   Coach Marty Jacobson is known as Jake among his ``softball
girls'' at the highly selective Fiorello H. La Guardia High School
of Music, Art and the Performing Arts, as well as among his
``soccer guys'' across the street at the gritty Martin Luther King
Jr. High School. Side by side and worlds apart, both schools front
on Amsterdam Avenue and face Lincoln Center.
</P>
<P>
   The mercurial 52-year-old coach shuttles between them, lugging
heavy baggage. As most teachers and students on both sides of the
street know, his spectacular career has been clouded recently by
defaulted games and a suspension. It is not clear whether he will
be rehired as soccer coach at King, where he works full time as a
guidance counselor.
</P>
<P>
   What few know is that tests he had recently revealed the
presence of the hepatitis C virus, a potentially life-threatening
condition. Jacobson has also suffered liver damage.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, the dawning of the softball season is an emotional spring.
The 14-game league schedule begins next month.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just not as intense over here,'' said Jacobson, his face
and body atypically relaxed as the girls warmed up with plastic
balls and bats. They were waiting for the soccer, tennis and
handball teams to leave the yellow gym. ``Ultimately, they're all
kids, they need encouragement, they need to know they're safe at
school. But here, we come back singing on the subway after a
defeat. That would never happen at King.''
</P>
<P>
   King is a hard school, typical of the city, the teachers a mix
of saints, pros and clock-watchers, the students predominantly
blacks and Latinos from Manhattan and Brooklyn scrabbling to make
it on a tough, tilted field. Their best-known sports team is male,
mostly blacks born in Africa and the Caribbean who came to Jake
through the worldwide soccer network.
</P>
<P>
   The team has been undefeated on the field in the past two years
as it won two straight city championships. For the players, many of
whom are isolated by language and lifestyle from the rest of the
student body, soccer is an identity and often the only way to get
to college.
</P>
<P>
   Students on the La Guardia side of the street, who need a
portfolio or an audition act for admission, tend to enter with an
identity and a life plan. The school combines two celebrated high
schools: Performing Arts, which inspired the film ``Fame,'' and
Music &AMP; Art.
</P>
<P>
   Student actors, vocalists, musicians, artists and dancers (who
are prohibited from varsity sports) often leave private schools to
attend La Guardia. Sports is usually a diversion and a nice
extracurricular activity to list on college applications.
</P>
<P>
   In nine years at La Guardia, Jacobson has rarely posted a
winning season. When the team did qualify for the city championship
tournament, the starting pitcher and catcher were unable to play
because of the spring drama festival. La Guardia lost.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Nathanson of La Guardia, the rare athletic director in
the city with a Ph.D., originally hired Jacobson as boys' soccer
coach. Jacobson was already a counselor at King. Five years ago,
after making La Guardia soccer competitive, Jacobson left, with
Nathanson's blessing, for the King soccer job. But he stayed with
softball, which pays about $5,200 ($31 an hour for 168 hours) a
season. Soccer (120 hours) pays about $3,700.
</P>
<P>
   Like many coaches, Jacobson complains about the disparity
between the pay and the time and emotional demands of the jobs.
There is an almost preppy feel to a La Guardia practice (``I like
the outfield very much,'' cries Krystyna Printup, a painter from
Rego Park, Queens, angling for an audition) and Jacobson seems more
doting uncle than the demanding father figure he is at King, where
urban realities have made him an easy touch for holiday dinners or
shoes.
</P>
<P>
   La Guardia girls miss practice because of violin lessons and
photography shows. King boys miss practice because they have to
work overtime in fast-food restaurants. When senior catcher Kate
Hoffman borrowed $5 from Jacobson, her father returned it at the
next game. The 1997-98 season's King star, Mansour Ndiaye, simply
became part of Jacobson's family for food, clothing and weekends.
</P>
<P>
   Mansour, who dropped in to softball practice last week, is an
easy favorite son. A freshman starter and budding star on the
University of Connecticut's excellent team, he is also fulfilling
his promise as King's salutatorian, running a 3.84 average as an
engineering student.
</P>
<P>
   It is not clear what combination of Jacobson's cocky
carelessness and the jealous pettiness of opposing coaches almost
derailed King this past season. Two players were ruled ineligible,
one for missing school on a game day for a doctor's appointment
without proper consent, and the other for being overage.
</P>
<P>
   Games were forfeited, although not enough to affect King's
winning the championship. But it was enough, according to Principal
Stephanie D'Amore, to taint the title. She suspended Jacobson. She
subsequently rescinded the suspension, but has yet to announce
whether she will allow him to return as coach. Through the
teachers' union, he can appeal her decision.

 NEW YORK: her decision.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Of more pressing urgency is Jacobson's health. Remarkably fit
and physically active _ he referees and competes in basketball,
among other sports _ he was shocked by the diagnosis of hepatitis
C.
</P>
<P>
   Jacobson is a recovering drug and alcohol abuser; he says he has
been sober for 15 years. A biopsy indicated Stage II liver disease;
he is currently asymptomatic, but there is scarring. He is
discussing treatment options, including drugs that may temporarily
tire and sicken him.
</P>
<P>
   This would interfere not only with counseling and coaching, but
with a new Nike contract. The shoe company discovered Jacobson last
season, donated equipment to the Martin Luther King team and hired
him as a consultant; one market scenario has soccer's next American
wave coming from the kind of inner-city immigrants who have won for
King.
</P>
<P>
   So Jacobson happily crosses the street into La Guardia softball,
where the daily dramas of adolescence are no less urgent for the
actors, but the game has a softer, more playful edge.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ultimately, they're just as needy as the boys,'' he said,
``but life feels easier on this side of the street because winning
isn't so important.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Softball is my life,'' sang out Ruthy Henry, a vocalist from
Staten Island. She checked to see if Jake was in earshot. ``I love
it even more than singing.''
</P>
<P>
   But Erica Feldherr, who played for four years on a Little League
team in Jackson Heights, Queens, admitted that she did not find
softball satisfying.
</P>
<P>
   ``Baseball, I want to play baseball,'' she said. ``I want a
league of my own.''

FROM LAWYER TO MISSING MAN TO FEDERAL FUGITIVE  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Wash., Mass., Conn.)   By MIKE ALLEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MARLBOROUGH, Conn. _ The frequent requests for fees in advance,
the secretiveness, the blithe disregard for phone messages, all
made Dennis B. Messenger wonder about the lawyer representing his
brother on a murder charge.
</P>
<P>
   But then the lawyer, F. Mac Buckley, turned on the charm that
had made him one of Connecticut's best-known criminal defense
attorneys.
</P>
<P>
   Over sole and lobster at the Chowder Pot IV restaurant in
Hartford, he regaled Messenger with tales of his years of freeing
mobsters, moonlighting as a boxing promoter and dabbling in
politics. He barely paused to chew as he told how he had worked his
way through college and law school, then got his start as a federal
drug prosecutor.
</P>
<P>
   This was the full Mac Buckley treatment _ an entrancing dose of
the chatter and blather that the burly lawyer had honed with juries
and unleashed on ESPN as a commentator during the O.J. Simpson
trial. Messenger said that Buckley, 57, went on to boast about his
estate here in the Connecticut countryside, then confided that he
loved his work so much that he would never retire.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wasn't conventional, but I could see he was powerful in the
state and knew how to work the system,'' Messenger recalled
thinking.
</P>
<P>
   Messenger picked up the check. He now believes he was being
snowed.
</P>
<P>
   Buckley vanished on March 1, leaving behind several clients _
including Messenger's brother, David _ who now accuse him of
absconding with hundreds of thousands of dollars that he held in
trust for them. As clients got over the shock of his disappearance
and began checking their accounts and then calling the authorities,
Buckley went from missing man to wanted man. Warrants were issued
charging him with forgery and embezzlement, and last week he was
declared a federal fugitive. Investigators said that they expected
more charges.
</P>
<P>
   The country estate turned out to be just a house; the adjoining
50-acre farm was sold off four years ago, although Buckley still
sometimes gave Buck Hill Farm as his address. The house was put in
the name of Buckley's wife, Donna, in 1990, and she is the
registered owner of their three cars.
</P>
<P>
   Buckley was last seen pulling out of the driveway of the
260-year-old Colonial house in his teal 1998 Lincoln Navigator with
a New England Patriots sticker in the back window. His family said
that about noon he called his office in Hartford from his cellular
phone to say he was headed for federal court in New Haven, where he
was due at 2 p.m. The judge and other lawyers waited until 5 and
then gave up.
</P>
<P>
   In the first days after the disappearance, Buckley's family and
friends said they feared he might have been done in by a former
client or an enemy of one of the gang members and mobsters he had
defended over the years. State troopers in cruisers and a plane
scoured the 45 miles between Marlborough and New Haven, checking
every exit ramp and parking lot. They then searched airports and
train stations throughout Connecticut, Massachusetts and New York.
They found nothing.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators say that in the first few days Buckley was
missing, a signal was picked up from his cellular phone _ which was
briefly switched on, although he was not making calls _ near
Albany.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators say they have one other clue. Late in the
afternoon on March 5, a man approached a caretaker at St. Agnes
Cemetery in Menands, N.Y., just outside Albany, and asked to be
directed to the grave of Buckley's father. The caretaker checked
the register, pointed the man toward the plot and never saw him
again. Later, the caretaker was shown Buckley's photo, and he said
he was certain that Buckley was the visitor he had helped.
</P>
<P>
   A senior state official said that Buckley's family did not
report him missing for 30 hours, and even then relatives made the
report only after the police had heard about the disappearance from
other lawyers and went to the Buckley home. He left behind five
daughters including one, Moira L. Buckley, who was his law partner.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Buckley's shingle was removed from the lawn outside
his office in Hartford, and his nameplate on the front door was
painted over.
</P>
<P>
   But such was Buckley's mystique that many of his neighbors and
associates refuse to believe that he disappeared intentionally. In
the courthouses and law offices of Connecticut, the tales have
grown increasingly wild: that he has joined the federal
witness-protection program, that he has enlisted in the Irish
Republican Army, that he is on a gambling spree in Canada.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, his clients are left with no lawyer and, some
say, no money. John T. Spellman, an owner of Marlborough Tavern,
where Buckley used booth A-2 as a satellite office for meeting
clients, is left puzzling over what the lawyer told him in their
last conversation. ``I'm like Frank Sinatra,'' Buckley said he had
just told his doctor, spurning advice to give up cigars and liquor.
``I've done it my way. I'm not afraid to die.''
</P>
<P>
   Friends suspect the image-conscious Buckley would be dismayed to
learn that his ``wanted'' posters identify him as Francis McKeon
Buckley, the name he was given when he was born in New Haven. He
grew up in Scarsdale, N.Y., and graduated from the College of the
Holy Cross in Worcester, Mass., in 1963 and Georgetown University
Law Center in 1967. He often described himself as ``a Golden Gloves
boxer.''
</P>
<P>
   He clerked for a Connecticut Supreme Court justice, then learned
both sides of the legal trade as an assistant federal prosecutor
and an assistant public defender. He lost when he ran for Congress
as a Republican in 1974, then settled the next year for being
elected a councilman from Newington.
</P>
<P>
   At nights and on weekends, he was a boxing trainer and promoter,
and groomed one champion, the welterweight Marlon Starling. Buckley
was tough with his boxers, making them lose weight and work out in
rubber suits when others were resting up for bouts. But he made
friends around inner-city gyms by paying down-and-out fighters to
spar with his boxers. He often took a carload of poor youngsters to
see out-of-town fights.
</P>
<P>
   Buckley was at home with Connecticut society, where he bought a
$3,500 box at January's inaugural ball for Gov. John G. Rowland, as
well as in Hartford's housing projects, where youngsters who knew
him from boxing called him ``Big Daddy Mac.''
</P>
<P>
   In the courtroom, Buckley used sarcasm, street slang and
disarming frankness to dazzle juries. During his summations in mob
cases, jaded clerks from throughout the courthouse squeezed into
the benches as spectators.
</P>
<P>
   ``He lost it and he shot him,'' Buckley said of one client,
arguing that a murder charge was too serious. He derided a drug
informer's work as ``just a sloppy, slanted job.'' Two bumbling
informers in another case became ``the dynamic duo.''
</P>
<P>
   William F. Dow III, a New Haven lawyer, said Buckley entertained
other lawyers with his street machismo, but drove them crazy with
his sloppy habits. ``He was always late, always out of contact, no
one ever knew how to reach him,'' Dow said. ``That was always part
of the mystery about Mac _ how someone that difficult to get hold
of could be so successful. The answer was that he was a great
lawyer.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   But his habits also prompted a stream of complaints from clients
to the Statewide Grievance Committee, which disciplines lawyers,
and led to a reprimand.
</P>
<P>
   On the day Buckley disappeared, a lawyer for the grievance
committee had recommended that Buckley's law license be suspended
because of the case involving Messenger's brother. The brother,
David, who is awaiting trial on a charge that he murdered his wife,
was a salesman for a scientific instrument company and had assets
of $500,000 to $1 million, relatives say.
</P>
<P>
   In court papers, the grievance committee said Buckley ``induced
David Messenger to provide him a complete power of attorney and may
have dissipated David Messenger's assets.'' Acting on the
complaint, a Superior Court judge suspended Buckley's law license a
week after his disappearance.
</P>
<P>
   The criminal charges against Buckley, which were filed 12 days
after he disappeared, stem from the case of a couple in Hebron,
Conn., who had entrusted to Buckley the $580,000 they received in a
settlement in 1994 after a daughter was killed in a drunken driving
accident. Buckley, in an unusual move for a lawyer, invested the
money for the couple, David and Sharon Fracchia.
</P>
<P>
   In a lawsuit, the couple charged that on Feb. 1, Buckley
converted two of their certificates of deposit into a check for
$144,554, then signed their names on the back and cashed it at a
bank in Malden, Mass. The lawsuit said he had failed to keep them
posted on the state of their account and had repeatedly ignored
their requests for updates. In addition to the missing check, about
$300,000 in investments is unaccounted for, said a lawyer for the
couple, Robert J.T. Britt of Hartford.
</P>
<P>
   Buckley responded with prickly indignation to the string of
formal complaints from clients who said he had ignored them or
missed deadlines.
</P>
<P>
   In the case that drew a reprimand in 1997, involving failure to
release records to a prisoner who wanted to fire him, Buckley wrote
to the grievance committee that the prisoner would have to get
someone to pick the records up.
</P>
<P>
   ``We spent a lot of time and money copying and I don't intend to
finance the shipping,'' Buckley wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Just in the last three months, according to lawyers and court
papers, Buckley had explained his lapses by complaining variously
of back trouble, a cardiac problem and acute sinusitis.
</P>
<P>
   Among those who say Buckley abandoned them is Debbie Brahm, 32,
of Marlborough, who hired him to handle her divorce several years
ago. Ms. Brahm, a mother of two, had met Buckley when she worked at
a convenience store and he came in every morning to buy the New
York newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   After taking her case, she said, ``He never returned my calls.''
</P>
<P>
   She said she paid him several thousand dollars in cash and
cannot afford to pay another lawyer to start over again. She is
hoping his daughter, Moira, will pick up the case, but has begun to
worry.
</P>
<P>
   ``She hasn't returned my calls, either,'' Ms. Brahm said.

SPORTS COLUMN: JETS' MOVES DRIVEN BY DESIRE TO WIN NOW
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By   GERALD ESKENAZI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ And then there was one _ maybe.
</P>
<P>
   With their trade on Friday of quarterback Glenn Foley to the
Seahawks, the Jets have tidied up virtually all the odds and ends
they brought into the off-season.
</P>
<P>
   And they have emerged significantly stronger in at least three
positions, even before their conditioning program starts on
Wednesday. The Jets appear to be so strong that the Caesars Palace
oddsmaker Vince Magliulo makes them the third choice to win the
Super Bowl behind the Vikings and the Broncos.
</P>
<P>
   Foley fetched a seventh-round draft pick as the Jets began the
process of accumulating choices. They will not, after all, have a
first-round selection. That goes to the Patriots, the last remnant
of the deal that allowed Bill Parcells to jump to the Jets. It is
looking like a bargain.
</P>
<P>
   The second season under Parcells ended in the AFC championship
game in Denver, with the Jets coming a fumble, or a dropped ball or
one tackle away from going to the Super Bowl. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Based on the scope and quality of the Jets' eight major
off-season moves _ has any team been busier? _ Parcells believes
the Jets have a shot at the Super Bowl. He wants it now. Actually,
that has always been his philosophy.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the NFL these days,'' Parcells likes to say, ``two years is
an eternity.'' In other words, planning for the year 2000 is a
waste of time.
</P>
<P>
   Their biggest off-season move, Parcells said, was the upgrade at
punter, where one of his favorites from New England, Tom Tupa,
replaced John Kidd. Tupa is also a quarterback, which gives the
Jets a personnel edge; they will be able to dress an extra
special-teams player because Tupa fills two positions.
</P>
<P>
   Tupa is also a proven cold-weather kicker, having played well at
Cleveland under Bill Belichick, who may even be the Jets' head
coach a year from now.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the Jets picked up a Pro Bowl safety in Steve
Atwater; a former Pro Bowl tight end in Eric Green, a starting
outside linebacker in Roman Phifer and a defensive end, Mike
Frederick, who could push Rick Lyle at the left side.
</P>
<P>
   The team also reined in Dwayne Gordon, who had tested free
agency after splitting starting time with Pepper Johnson at inside
linebacker last season. Johnson's retirement at the age of 35 is
likely. Then the Jets re-signed Vinny Testaverde, who produced the
finest statistical quarterback season in Jets history. Finally,
they traded Foley.
</P>
<P>
   If they were not perilously close to the salary cap, the Jets
might be bringing in a right guard to replace Matt O'Dwyer, who has
not been plucked as a free agent. Once the free-agency buying spree
around the NF L settles, someone of experience and quality may be
available.
</P>
<P>
   On paper, the Jets have a better punter, free safety and tight
end than last season. This is not inconsiderable. Atwater, who was
brought in after the Jets had tackling problems with all three free
safeties they used, finds a defensive style more suited to his
current speed, and age (32).
</P>
<P>
   He will also have a rigorous off-season conditioning program _
something he failed to benefit from each of the last two years
because of off-season surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Green, who has been known for his indifferent attitude toward
conditioning, will be in better shape or he won't be a Jet. He
replaces Kyle Brady, who had another ``almost'' season but could
never string together more than two or three games as a factor on
offense. In four years as a Jet, Brady caught a total of 93 passes
and 10 touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   And Tupa? He replaces the conference's poorest punter in gross
average. Kidd had a decent net average and was an excellent holder,
but each of Tupa's kicks traveled an average of 3.4 yards farther.
Tupa is also a very good holder.
</P>
<P>
   The Jets have also acquired depth, and probably a
first-stringer, at linebacker by signing Phifer, an eight-year
starter with the Rams. He played in obscurity on that perennially
troubled franchise.
</P>
<P>
   The Jets will now go to a four-linebacker alignment, using
Phifer and Mo Lewis on the outside, and Marvin Jones and Bryan Cox
on the inside. At the least, Phifer is insurance, joining a good
group of linebackers.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look at our linebackers,'' Chad Cascadden said,
``you've got six players who were starters _ Marvin, Mo, Bryan,
Dwayne, Phifer and me.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, there is Frederick, another former Raven/Brown with a
connection to Belichick and Scott Pioli, who handled pro personnel
with those teams and now does so with the Jets.
</P>
<P>
   Parcells, a baseball historian, knows the futility of the ``wait
till next year'' cry. He believes the Jets' future is in the
present. &QL;

IOWA STATE WOMEN UPSET UCONN 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By JERRY BREWER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CINCINNATI _ When it was over, when they had shocked the entire
nation and fiddled with the balance of power in women's basketball,
the Iowa State players celebrated beneath a 64-58 scoreboard. The
Cyclones huddled and bounced and hopped, a giddy group of winners
who had just done something almost no one had expected.
</P>
<P>
   They got hot at the right time against top-seeded Connecticut
Saturday in the Mideast Regional semifinals of the NCAA tournament
and bounced the disbelieving Huskies out into the cold. In the
process, the Cyclones denied the Huskies a sixth straight
30-victory season and, most important, a sixth straight appearance
in the final eight.
</P>
<P>
   Iowa State will play either second-seeded Clemson or
third-seeded Georgia Sunday for a chance to go to the Final Four.
</P>
<P>
   Down by 52-47 with five minutes left, Iowa State (25-7) made its
run. The Cyclones, the nation's second-best 3-point-shooting team,
finally started hitting their long-range bombs, something they had
not done until that point.
</P>
<P>
   The freshman forward Tracy Gahan began the surge with a
3-pointer from the right wing to pull Iowa State to 52-50 with 4
minutes 37 seconds left. One minute later, the junior guard Stacy
Frese hit one to trim the deficit to 54-53. Then, after the UConn
forward Svetlana Abrosimova missed a driving layup, the Cyclone
sophomore guard Megan Taylor hit a 3 to give Iowa State a 56-54
lead at the 2:19 mark.
</P>
<P>
   The Cyclones would never trail again. Another Frese 3-pointer
and two free throws preserved the victory as Connecticut misfired
when the Cyclones applied the pressure.
</P>
<P>
   For the top-seeded Huskies (29-5), a third straight sterling
regular season ended in postseason disappointment. For the third
straight season, UConn entered a regional heavily favored to
advance to the Final Four. Two years ago, a Tennessee team with 10
losses beat the Huskies in the last eight. Last season, an
unheralded North Carolina State team sent them home in the last
eight.
</P>
<P>
   Now, they head back to Storrs, Conn., even earlier. The pregame
chatter from the Huskies was that they were relaxed. They had put
that lackluster performance against Xavier in the second round
behind them. Their concentration and intensity level were different
now, the players said.
</P>
<P>
   And Connecticut seemed in control after it went on a 10-2
second-half run to turn a 37-36 deficit into a 46-39 lead _ its
biggest lead of the game _ at the 11-minute mark. The Huskies, for
the second game in a row, looked sluggish at the start, still
struggling with offensive execution, still looking like a team in
desperate need of a floor leader. UConn committed 13 turnovers in
the first half and entered the locker room with the score tied at
28-28, thanks mostly to the play of the freshman forward Tamika
Williams.
</P>
<P>
   The Huskies forced 11 turnovers and held Frese, Iowa State's
leading scorer at 17 points a game, to two points in the half. But
because of their own turnovers and poor first-half shooting (12 of
35, 34 percent), the Huskies were unable to capitalize.
</P>
<P>
   UConn's stars, Abrosimova and Shea Ralph, who entered the game
averaging a combined 34 points, had a combined eight points on
two-of-15 shooting at halftime. If not for the play of Williams, a
native of nearby Dayton, Ohio, the Huskies' struggles would have
been worse. Williams scored 12 points and was five of six from the
field in the half, including 10 points in the final 7:42 before
intermission.
</P>
<P>
   With UConn trailing by its biggest margin of the half at 18-12,
Williams scored five points during a 7-0 run that briefly reclaimed
the lead for the Huskies at 5:43.

HARDAWAY NEEDS TO BE LOVED 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By MIKE WISE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Barely eight days ago, the luster had worn off Orlando's quick
start. The Magic had lost embarrassingly to Dallas, Penny Hardaway
was pouting and all the old liabilities _ fragile egos, poor
shooting and bad chemistry _ had begun to resurface.
</P>
<P>
   The Magic, which has been fighting for respectability ever since
Shaquille O'Neal went Hollywood, appeared to be fraying at the
edges again. Its losing streak numbered only three games, but
Hardaway was feeling insecure about his position and the team's.
</P>
<P>
   At the height of his anxiety, he felt he had no relationship
with coach Chuck Daly.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just didn't talk, and I figured that meant he really didn't
have confidence in me,'' Hardaway said. ``I shouldn't have assumed
that, but that's just how it was.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know we make all this money and everything, and you wouldn't
think some of us need reinforcement,'' he added. ``But you want to
hear from your coach that you're doing well, even at this level.''
</P>
<P>
   Daly, regarded as the ultimate players' coach, a coach who once
gave Isiah Thomas and the Detroit Pistons a day off because Thomas
was angry over a newspaper column, quickly remedied the situation
by meeting with Hardaway at an Oakland, Calif., hotel before the
Magic met the Golden State Warriors a week ago last night.
</P>
<P>
   ``He basically told me to have fun, don't take things too
seriously and to communicate with him any time I wanted to,''
Hardaway said. ``I'm not saying that was the main reason we haven't
lost since, but it definitely helped. He let me know how important
I was to this team.''
</P>
<P>
   With their victory over the Knicks here Thursday night, the
Magic have won four straight and head into Sunday's nationally
televised home game against the Lakers with the second-best record
in the Eastern Conference.
</P>
<P>
   Hardaway, having missed 86 games over the past two seasons
because of surgeries on his left knee, is slowly regaining his form
as the multidimensional player who led the Magic to the finals in
1995 along with O'Neal, whom he will play against today for the
first time.
</P>
<P>
   The two were teammates in the All-Star Game last year and on the
1996 Olympic team, but have not competed against each other since
O'Neal signed with the Lakers in '96 because they were injured in
different seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's good for TV,'' said Hardaway, who added that he has no
relationship with O'Neal, even though the two own homes two minutes
from each other in Isleton, an Orlando suburb. ``Shaq had to do
what he had to do for himself. I'm glad he's not here now. Him
being unhappy would have made us unhappy.''
</P>
<P>
   Hardaway has still not completely recaptured the form that made
him one of the game's best 10 players three years ago. But his
averages of 15.4 points, 6 rebounds, 5 assists and 2 steals per
game are not bad, given he played only 19 games last season.
</P>
<P>
   Criticized by his teammates for babying his injury and not
playing when he could have last season, Hardaway is widely
perceived as a player who is not mentally strong.
</P>
<P>
   ``It bothered me, that guys would question my heart,'' Hardaway
said. ``But, you know, no one knows your body but you. For them to
say that without going through what I went through was not right.''
</P>
<P>
   He did not help his cause when he endorsed the firing of Coach
Brian Hill two seasons ago. Whether his meeting with Daly will pay
long-term dividends is unclear. But Hardaway, who for some reason
needs to know he's not taken for granted, seems to be a more secure
and confident player.

 &HT;    As QBs sign, Jeff George waits
 &HT;    By Len Pasquarelli
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ While the owners seemed mired in intertia during last
week's NFL meetings, some coaches kept the game of quarterback
musical chairs going long enough to maintain interest. Before the
meetings had adjourned, three former starters _ Scott Mitchell
(Detroit to Baltimore), Jim Harbaugh (Baltimore to San Diego) and
Glenn Foley (N.Y. Jets to Seattle) _ changed teams in trades.
</P>
<P>
   The one quarterback still scrambling for a chair, however, as
the music winds down is Jeff George. Whatever ill-will remains
toward George in Atlanta, even his critics have to concede the lack
of interest in him, particularly when players like Chris Miller,
Todd Marinovich, Andre Ware and Mark Rypien are attempting
comebacks, is inexplicable.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, there's nothing going on,'' George agent Leigh
Steinberg said at the meetings. ``Part of it was the timing
because, had we known the Raiders weren't going to keep him, we
would have started shopping him. But (Raiders vice president) Bruce
Allen negotiated as if we were trying to come to a deal. (Now)
we've pulled him back. Nothing will happen at least until after the
draft.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the coaches surveyed here agreed George has more talent
than any of the guys signed as free agents _ Rich Gannon (Oakland),
Kerry Collins (N.Y. Giants), Trent Green (St. Louis) and Doug
Pederson (Philadelphia). And certainly he carries less baggage than
Collins. But the coaches, almost to a man, cited George's losing
record in the NFL and a perception he is not close to his
teammates.
</P>
<P>
   There are rumblings Jimmy Johnson is tempted to bring George to
Miami as a backup to Dan Marino. And Dennis Green, publicly
confident in Randall Cunningham but privately wary he could
backslide in Minnesota, has some interest.
</P>
<P>
   It may take an injury in camp to get George a job. That his
situation has degenerated to that is more a factor of coaching
shortsightedness than George's own shortcomings.
</P>
<P>
   Tuning in
</P>
<P>
   Beyond their lack of action on most issues, what most marked the
owners last week was their hypocrisy. The league will give Los
Angeles the opportunity for the 32nd franchise based primarily on
its edge in ``TV households'' (5.5 million-4.0 million) over
Houston, even though the latter is clearly more prepared for a new
team. But all the owners who recently relocated teams _ Art Modell
(Baltimore), Georgia Frontiere (St. Louis), Al Davis (Oakland), Bud
Adams (Nashville), Bill Bidwill (Arizona) and Bob Kraft (Hartford)
_ went from bigger to smaller markets. It didn't seem to matter in
those cases. San Diego owner Alex Spanos chided Adams and Kraft for
pushing the Los Angeles market so hard, but he still voted for L.A.
</P>
<P>
   Tip sheet
</P>
<P>
   Although he's visited Chicago and New England, the most likely
landing spot for free agent linebacker Jamir Miller of Arizona is
with Tennessee. General manager Floyd Reese has been trying to work
on numbers with agent Steve Baker for three weeks, but the Titans
have only $87,000 left in the cap and will have to reshuffle some
contracts to make room. Coach Steve Fisher wants to use Miller much
like he did Lamar Lathon, to rush off the edge, a tactic that would
net the linebacker 10-12 sacks. . . . The Cowboys quietly have
reached a five-year agreement with free agent center Mark
Stepnoski. . . . Defensive end Charles Haley played so well in two
postseason appearances last year that 49ers coach Steve Mariucci
and club president Bill Walsh want him back for '99. . . . Steelers
owner Dan Rooney met with Steinberg and began earnest negotiations
on an extension for quarterback Kordell Stewart. . . . Carolina
linebacker Kevin Greene may talk himself right out of a job. New
Panthers coach George Seifert feels Greene would be perfect for the
``elephant'' pass-rush position his defense uses. But Greene told
Seifert he is still an every-down linebacker, something he really
hasn't been for six years. . . . Doug FlutieRob JohnsonRalph

 &HT;    Nolan a coach minus team
 &HT;    By Jeff Schultz
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Creating a resume and sitting by a silent telephone can be a
humbling experience for a man, particularly one approaching his
41st birthday.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, Ted Nolan has been at the bottom. As a Native
American from the Ojibway tribe, he grew up on a reservation in
Sault St. Marie, Ontario, one of 12 children, with no plumbing and
no Kroger. If you wanted food, you killed it.
</P>
<P>
   Years later, Nolan would become known for his skills as a hockey
coach and master motivator, leading the surprising Buffalo Sabres
from fifth to first in the Northeast Division in 1996-97 and into
the second round of the playoffs, earning NHL coach of the year.
His reward from the Sabres: a token offer of a one-year extension,
which he rejected.
</P>
<P>
   Nolan has been without a head coaching job since. Why, he said,
``is the million dollar question,'' although he has some
suspicions. But after more than a year of giving motivational
speeches _ an average of four per week _ and doing some scouting
for Canadian Hockey, Nolan is itchy to return to coaching. That's
why he completed a resume for the first time last week and plans to
start sending copies.
</P>
<P>
   And yes, he will be mailing one to Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Thrashers general manager Don Waddell has said Nolan will be
among as many as a dozen potential coaches he will do a background
check on, a process that will lead to about five interviews. ``As
you approach a search, you have to look at everybody who's had
success in the league, and he has,'' Waddell said. ``For whatever
reasons, he's not working now. I'm surprised.''
</P>
<P>
   Nolan said, ``I would feel honored just to be contacted'' by the
Thrashers. He appears to fill the prerequisites for the job. He
favors an attack style of hockey, which jibes with Waddell's plans
on how to build the roster. He has strong motivational skills,
which is imperative for any coach but particularly one heading a
group of castoffs thrown together on an expansion team. Further,
his good looks and reputation for dressing well wouldn't hurt in
marketing, when the franchise is owned by a media conglomerate.
</P>
<P>
   Nolan has turned down assistant coaching offers from Tampa Bay
and the New York Islanders. ``I feel I'm a head coach, and I have a
little more to offer,'' he said from his home in Ontario. ``Head
coaches make decisions. Assistant coaches make suggestions.''
</P>
<P>
   That didn't help much in Buffalo. The Sabres were team turmoil
during Nolan's two years. Ownership was in the process of changing
from the financially strapped Seymour Knox to John Rigas. Knox got
sick and died. Two executives, John Moss and Larry Quinn, were
vying to run the franchise. Nolan and general manager John Muckler
also battled. Although Nolan was popular with most players, he had
problems with goalie Dominik Hasek, who left the ice in the middle
of a playoff game, claiming an injury.
</P>
<P>
   Quinn eventually won the power struggle. He fired Muckler, then
Nolan. Then Quinn himself was fired the next year. Muckler accused
Nolan of backstabbing him to ownership, which Nolan vehemently
denies. He says he merely gave the name of his mentor in junior
hockey, Sherry Bassin, to Rigas when the owner asked, ``Who did you
learn from?'' Word got back to Muckler, who took it the wrong way.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had our disagreements,'' Nolan said. ``But when I heard
stories about the backstabbing, that really hurt. Small minds. `He
did that; she did this.' I was never into that. I'm more into
resolutions.
</P>
<P>
   ``The big issue was the whole organization was in a tailspin. I
was the new kid on the block, and I got caught in the crossfire.''
</P>
<P>
   Has he been blackballed?
</P>
<P>
   ``To a point,'' he said. ``But if I'm an organization, I'll talk
directly to the horse, rather than listen to innuendo and rumors.''
</P>
<P>
   Fans held rallies in support of Nolan, and fans canceled 1,600
season tickets after they perceived that he and popular center Pat
Lafontaine both had been run off.
</P>
<P>
   Nolan still draws crowds _ but only when he makes speeches to
office managers.

 &HT;    NHL EAST NOTES: Trading deadline
 &HT;    By Jeff Schultz
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The NHL's trading deadline Tuesday tends to bring a flurry of
deals. Three teams in the East could be the most active:
</P>
<P>
   _ Washington reached the finals last season but has been
decimated by injuries all year, with more than 400 combined games
lost. The Caps have nine potential unrestricted free agents, and
general manager George McPhee is more concerned about next season
than the playoff stretch. Among those on the block: Mark Tinordi,
Dale Hunter, Joe Juneau and Brian Bellows.
</P>
<P>
   _ New York Islanders general manager Mike Milbury doesn't have a
mandate, because owner Howard Milstein is preoccupied with his
potential purchase of the Washington Redskins. But budget
casualties could include goalie Tommy Salo and forward Trevor
Linden.
</P>
<P>
   _ Tampa Bay general manager-coach Jacques Demers might not
survive himself, but he'll outlast forward Wendel Clark, who could
be headed to Dallas. The Lightning also would love to dump $3
million goalie Bill Ranford.
</P>
<P>
   Executive suite
</P>
<P>
   Philadelphia players, who take a 12-game winless streak (0-8-4)
into today's game against Detroit (Fox, 3 p.m.), have more to fret
about than general manager Bob Clarke taking away their three-day
vacation in New Orleans. The Flyers' plummet from first to sixth in
the Eastern Conference overall standings even has owner Ed Snider
fuming in public. ``I think 50 percent of this game is mental, and
this team has had a complete mental collapse,'' Snider said. ``I've
never seen anything like it. To see a team play so well and then
play so poorly _ the same team _ for such long stretches, I've
never seen this happen.'' Things boiled over Tuesday, when two
apparent Philadelphia goals were disallowed in a 5-2 loss to St.
Louis, and coach Roger Neilson threw a stick onto the ice, drawing
an ejection, two-game suspension and $10,000 fine. The Blues' Chris
Pronger joked, ``His javelin throw was a little off center. He was
trying to throw it toward the referee, but he shanked it, and it
went towards the linesman.''
</P>
<P>
   Gretzky update
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers' Wayne Gretzky is targeting a March 27 game against
the Flyers as his possible return from a protruding disc in his
neck, but that date might be too optimistic. He hasn't played since
Feb. 22 _ and he has received no shortage of advice on treatment.
``I heard everything from acupuncture to soft tissue specialists
and a couple of voodoo doctors. But I believe in the old system.
The doctors have been to a school for a lot of years.''Bobby Orr

   ATLANTA _ Thrashers update: IceForum owner Jack Burton was
thrilled when Thrashers general manager Don Waddell announced that
all practices at the team's Duluth practice facility will be open
to the public next season. ``That's really good news, because I'm
going to build a restaurant and bar overlooking the Thrashers'
practice rink,'' he said. ... Construction on the facility, which
will include workout facilities, locker room and team offices,
probably will begin next week. Installation of a second rink is
scheduled for June. Both projects are slated to be completed by
late August. The Thrashers are scheduled to open training camp
Sept. 4 and plan to have part of camp at the IceForum. But they
might start camp in Orlando, at the facility shared by the NBA's
Magic and the IHL's Solar Bears, Atlanta's minor-league affiliate.
... At the groundbreaking, team vice president Dave Maggard said,
``We have several shovels here so we can accelerate the
construction.'' ... Waddell on the open practices: ``This is an
opportunity for the people to come out and see the players and get
autographs. Our players will be part of this community. They'll
live in the area, and this is pretty much going to be our home from
day to day.''

<P>
   _ On the March 23 trading deadline: ``I kind of get excited.
It's fun to see what different teams are going to do. But
certainly, there is a lot of uncertainty in the dressing room,
players not knowing whether they're going to be traded or not. When
it's over, a lot of guys kind of take a deep breath.''

<P>
   _ On the Blues being short-handed 79 more times than on the
power play: ``A lot of times, we're a perimeter team, and, if you
don't drive the net, it's hard to draw penalties. If you're tripped
in the corner, it's a little different than if you're coming out
with a scoring opportunity.''

 &HT;    NHL WEST NOTES: The Low down
 &HT;    By Jeff Schultz
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Despite the team's financial difficulties and several public
declarations of support from general manager Glen Sather, Edmonton
coach Ron Low might be the least secure coach in the league right
now. The Oilers reached the second round of the playoffs the past
two years, but are headed for their fourth consecutive sub-.500
season under Low and their worst record since George Burnett was
fired 35 games into his brief tenure in 1994-95. Thursday night's
4-1 home loss to New Jersey might have been the low point. Four
minutes into the second period, Edmonton trailed 3-0 and was being
outshot 30-4. ``I was embarrassed,'' Low said. ``If the fans had
thrown their tickets onto the ice, it would've been a good
response. The players said a lot in our team meeting (Monday), but
if you're going to talk the talk, you better walk the walk. If you
don't, it's trouble.'' For the coach.
</P>
<P>
   Cat fight
</P>
<P>
   The verbal war between Vancouver general manager Brian Burke and
coach Mike Keenan unfortunately didn't end when Keenan was canned
at the All-Star break. Keenan went on Canadian television last week
and said Burke told him to fire assistant coach Stan Smyl and
predicted Mark Messier would be traded before his contract expires
next year. Burke is investigating whether the comments constitute a
confidentiality breach that would enable the Canucks to cut off
their financial obligations to the ex-coach. ``I think it's
pathetic he's dragged Mess into this,'' Burke said. ``He has
something personal against me and (ownership). He shouldn't be
worrying about us. He should worry about finding a job.''
</P>
<P>
   Wily Coyotes
</P>
<P>
   So what are the chances Jerry Colangelo has his fingerprints on
this one? Colangelo, who operates the entire Phoenix sports world
except the NHL's Coyotes, has been upset that the hockey team is
seeking a new arena project in neighboring Scottsdale. The Coyotes
are losing $4million to $6 million per year, in part because of
unsold obstructed seats at AmericaWest Arena. But word now has
leaked that Suns minority partner Barry Kemp, Colangelo's pal,
heads a group that has offered Coyotes owner Richard Burke $80
million to $100 million for the team. Was publicizing the offer
meant to derail the new arena plans? Burke, who has turned down the
offer, said, ``I'm not one who attributes motives, but the first
time this came up was when the Los Arcos project (in Scottsdale)
was announced. The second time around, it was the (Scottsdale) City
Council vote. And the third time was the legislative vote (on
stadium districts). Los Arcos will happen, and we're going to stick
it through.''
</P>
<P>
   Etc.
</P>
<P>
   A recent nine-game winless streak probably smothered Nashville's
playoff hopes, but coach Barry Trotz isn't conceding anything
publicly: ``We were holding onto the ledge with our fingers, and
now we've got our hands over the side. Who knows? Down the line, we
might even be standing up on that ledge.'' . . . The winless streak
hasn't affected attendance in Nashville, where the average is over
16,000 for the first time this season.

THE NBA AT MID-SEASON: CANDIDATES FOR AWARDS  
 VAN GUNDY AND LONGEVITY 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By MIKE WISE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ahead at the Half . . .  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It is the halfway point in this lockout-ruptured season, time
for midseason report cards. Herewith, some front-runners for the
post-season awards:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; SIXTH MAN &LR;  _ Darrell Armstrong in a landslide. At 6 feet and
180 pounds, the diminutive Orlando point guard has taken 22 charges
and scored more points than any other player not starting.
Portland's Rasheed Wallace and Indiana's Jalen Rose will be in the
running, and you can throw Latrell Sprewell's name in there, too,
although before yesterday he had come off the bench in only 10
games for the Knicks. But Armstrong looks like a lock.
</P>
<P>
   Not bad for someone who had to try out for John Gabriel, now the
Orlando general manager, during halftime of a United States
Basketball League game in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; MOST VALUABLE PLAYER &LR;  _ Shaquille O'Neal and Karl Malone are
the obvious choices, but there is no shame in taking Allen Iverson
after almost 25 games. He is not only leading the league in
scoring, but leading the fourth-best team in the Eastern
Conference. Alonzo Mourning should also be in the running. And
don't discount Jason Kidd just because Phoenix has struggled. His
triple-doubles aside, he has been the best player on the floor in
almost every game he has played.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; COACH OF THE YEAR &LR;  _ The usual suspects, Chuck Daly, Pat Riley
and Larry Brown, should contend with Portland's Mike Dunleavy.
Riley should get the early nod, based on the myriad injuries Miami
has faced. Dunleavy, though, has done wonders by finding time for
every key player. Daly and Philadelphia's Brown have both got
former lottery teams to play beyond expectations.
</P>
<P>
   Two coaches who deserve to be in the running: Jerry Sloan and
Butch Carter. All Sloan has done is lead Utah, the oldest team in
the league, to the best record in the truncated,
three-games-in-three-nights season. And perhaps no coach has done
more with less talent than Toronto's Carter.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; EXECUTIVE OF THE YEAR &LR;  _ Orlando's John Gabriel and
Sacramento's Geoff Petrie. Gabriel traded Johnny Taylor and Keon
Clark to free up salary cap room so the Magic could sign Isaac
Austin. He also drafted Michael Doleac and Matt Harpring,
more-than-decent rookies. Petrie, meanwhile, revamped the Kings.
The only general manager to field a completely new starting five,
he traded for Chris Webber, drafted Jason Williams, signed Vlade
Divac and convinced the best player in Greece, Predrag Stoyakovic,
to leave the comforts of Europe.
</P>
<P>
   If the Lakers don't implode, Jerry West will also be in the
running for plucking Glen Rice from Charlotte and Dennis Rodman
from threatened retirement, not to mention Carmen Electra. But
Toronto's Glen Grunwald should also get some votes. In less than 24
hours last summer, he ran the table _ swapping Vince Carter for
Antawn Jamison on draft day and acquiring the warrior Charles
Oakley for the waif Marcus Camby. It's as if the Warriors and
Knicks got together last June and decided, ``Hey, let's make the
Raptors better.''
</P>
<P>
   Longevity Gets You Nowhere
</P>
<P>
   When Jeff Van Gundy said he was surprised last week that rumors
of his demise had not surfaced earlier, he was hardly resorting to
his usual sarcasm. Since he took over for Don Nelson in March 1996,
23 other franchises have replaced their head coaches.
</P>
<P>
   Van Gundy has the sixth-longest tenure of any current NBA coach.
Keeping his job the last three-plus seasons, he joins a select
group.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Sloan has been with Utah for 11 seasons, followed by Rudy
Tomjanovich, who has worked eight seasons in Houston. Atlanta's
Lenny Wilkins and Cleveland's Mike Fratello have been in place for
six seasons and Pat Riley has led the Heat for four seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Nice company, but not the kind of thing that will persuade
Madison Square Garden executives to extend Van Gundy's contract
beyond next season. Barring an on-floor Knicks catastrophe, Van
Gundy is going nowhere this season. But if he does not find a way
to coax the Knicks into the Eastern finals, the suits will get
antsy and demand change. It may not be right or fair. But they
can't help it; that's just their fickle way.

 &HT;    10 years after Valdez spill, signs of recovery
 &HT;    By Patricia Guthrie
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   VALDEZ, Alaska _ Stan Stephens hears the question so often, he
keeps the answer in his pocket. It doesn't look like much. Just a
tiny piece of crusted black gunk.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, there's still a lot of oil out there in the sand, under
the rocks, along some shoreline,'' Stephens says, his sea-blue eyes
fixed on the horizon. ``Prince William Sound is no longer pristine
country. If you never go ashore and just stay on a boat, you'd
never know there was an oil spill. But these bays, they used to be
so full of life. And they're just not anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Ten years ago on Good Friday, March 24, the rest of the world
learned what 64-year-old Stephens had known for decades: Prince
William Sound is one of the most beautiful inlets on Earth. Or was.
</P>
<P>
   Surrounded by the Chugach Mountains and Chugach National Forest
and chock-full of slowly carved glaciers and fjords, the sound
includes 11,000 square miles of shore, islands and open water, an
area larger than Vermont.
</P>
<P>
   Seen from the deck of the Glacier Spirit, one of five scenic
tour boats of Stan Stephens Cruises, or from the air while
``flightseeing,'' the region's sparkling blues, jade greens and ice
whites are probably as vivid as they appeared 200 years ago when
English explorer Capt. James Cook named it for the British
monarch's third son.
</P>
<P>
   Harems of Stellar sea lions still lounge on rocks surrounding
one lucky male. Porpoises still playfully jump in the wake of
sightseeing boats. Bald eagles still glide on grand wings.
</P>
<P>
   But many say there are far fewer birds, fish and marine mammals
since the oil tanker Exxon Valdez hit Bligh Reef and oozed 11.3
million gallons of crude oil into the sound, the Gulf of Alaska and
hundreds of miles southwest into the Alaska Peninsula. Only two of
23 species _ the bald eagle and river otter _ have fully recovered,
says the Exxon Valdez Oil Spill Trustee Council, which oversees the
$900 million settlement Exxon gave the state and federal
governments for Prince William Sound restoration.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has clearly been progress toward recovery,'' says Molly
McCammon, the council's executive director. ``But it is equally
clear that for several species and the ecosystem in general,
there's a long way yet to go.''
</P>
<P>
   Exxon disagrees. After spending $2.2 billion on a four-year
cleanup and on animal rescue and rehabilitation ($32,000 per bird;
$82,000 per otter), Exxon says no species or natural resource
remains adversely affected.
</P>
<P>
   ``The environment in Prince William Sound is healthy, robust and
thriving,'' said Frank Sprow, Exxon's vice president for
environment and safety. ``That's evident to anyone who's been
there, and it is also the conclusion of many scientists who have
done extensive studies of the Prince William Sound ecosystem.''
</P>
<P>
   Exxon disputes the advisory council's definition of a
``recovered' species, and how it's measuring these populations. The
company also says the council fails to consider ``natural
variability'' such as the regional warming trend attributed to El
Nino.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the water temperature is rising three degrees in the past
decade, that causes a dramatic change among the plants and
animals,'' said biologist David Page of Maine's Bowdoin College, an
Exxon consultant. Trying to find evidence of the 1989 spill today,
Page says, ``is like trying to tune in NPR on Mars.''
</P>
<P>
   __
</P>
<P>
   Estimates as to how many animals died in the darkened waters
immediately after the spill vary, just as opinions on the long-term
impact differ.
</P>
<P>
   Hit hardest were birds. An estimated 260,000 to 580,000 got
mired in oil and died, with the common murre and pigeon guillemots
most affected. But some bird colonies are coming back.
</P>
<P>
   Sea otters, the big sad-eyed critters that became a symbol of
Alaska's helplessness during the crisis, are among the species
considered ``still recovering,'' as are many fish, clams, mussels
and intertidal ecosystems. An estimated 1,000 to 3,000 sea otters
died.
</P>
<P>
   About 300 harbor seals perished, but the species was already in
serious decline. Among Prince William Sound's 100 killer whales, 14
disappeared after the spill.
</P>
<P>
   The culprits were a black steel ship the length of three
football fields, along with one bearded skipper seen in Valdez
having a few stiff drinks hours before departing. Like some of the
animals, they, too, vanished but may be coming back.
</P>
<P>
   Exxon wants to bring back its notorious tanker, the Exxon Valdez
(named in honor of the town), which was banned from Alaskan waters
under the 1990 Oil Pollution Act. After undergoing extensive
repairs and renamed the SeaRiver Mediterranean, the tanker has been
in service in the Mediterranean Sea.
</P>
<P>
   Many Alaskans bitterly oppose the move, saying it's akin to
flying the Enola Gay over Japan again. Others who know boats say
the tanker is one of the safer, better ones built for the Alaska
route. ``We'd be working against ourselves if we were to say we
don't want that ship,'' Stephens says. ``The spill was human error.
It wasn't the boat's fault. But if they want local support to bring
that ship back, Exxon should take care of the fishermen.''
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Hazelwood, the Exxon captain responsible for grinding the
984-foot tanker on the reef, is scheduled to finally begin 1,000
hours of community service this summer by picking up trash in
Anchorage. He was acquitted of intoxication charges and
second-degree criminal mischief but found guilty of negligence.
</P>
<P>
   Fired by Exxon, Hazelwood returned to his New York roots to work
as a shipping accident claims adjuster for the Manhattan maritime
law firm representing him. He has remained mum on the events of the
midnight wreck. In the decade since the disaster, he has given one
major interview, to Outside magazine.
</P>
<P>
   ``Am I angst-ridden with guilt? No,'' he said. ``Am I feeling
responsible as a professional? Well, whether it's a mechanical
failure or anything else that grounds you, it sticks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't imagine this ever being over. It's always there, like
the albatross on the Ancient Mariner.''
</P>
<P>
   __
</P>
<P>
   When the tide is out, the table is set.
</P>
<P>
   But now when the tide is out, the table is dirty.
</P>
<P>
   Taking a twist on this old native adage about the abundance of
tasty treats found in the receding tide, Patience Anderson Faulkner
explains the spill's impact on her culture and people. Living in
Cordova, a fishing village of 2,500 residents with generational
ties to salmon and herring livelihoods, Faulkner is a member of the
Eyak tribe.
</P>
<P>
   Although oil never licked the shores of Cordova, the town is
considered the hardest hit by diminished fishing. State fishing
permits, once worth $200,000 to $300,000, have fallen to one-tenth
their original price. Youths no longer see a future in this serene
village. And families that once walked the beaches at low tide
scooping up clams and oysters for dinner now buy grocery store food
instead.
</P>
<P>
   ``It breaks my heart to see what has happened,'' says Faulkner,
51. ``I see the resentment every day in people's faces. We had the
largest fishing fleet in the sound. Kids would earn their college
tuition in one fishing season. Now even the older gentlemen are not
even able to make a living.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of that is due to disease that has decimated herring; some
is due to the falling price of salmon.
</P>
<P>
   A long-term study by J. Steven Picou, a University of South
Alabama sociologist, found the psychological stress of area natives
and commercial fishermen to be similar to that of rape victims and
those in bereavement.
</P>
<P>
   David Grimes, a 46-year-old Cordova fisherman and wilderness
guide, said it took several years to see the impact. Herring first
crashed in 1993 when the adult herring in the sound failed to
reproduce. The ones that were caught had mutations.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just shatters you to the core,'' Grimes says. ``It must be
like when Atlanta burned down. It's like going through the ashes
here when we see oil still welling up.''
</P>
<P>
   But the fish populations are coming back, and Grimes has hope.
``Time and Mother Nature do the healing,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Commercial fishing operators and native corporations are among
the major plaintiffs that sued Exxon. In 1994, an Anchorage jury
awarded $5 billion in punitive damages, the equivalent of Exxon's
after-tax income that year.
</P>
<P>
   Calling it ``unjust and excessive,'' Exxon appealed the decision
to the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals, where the case is pending. The
company already has paid $300 million to 11,000 area people and
businesses, more than one-third to Cordovans.
</P>
<P>
   But people here remember the company's promise when it flew in
executives 10 years ago after the disaster. John Devens, who was
mayor of Valdez at the time, recalls the company's vow: ``We will
have all your beaches cleaned and we will resolve every financial
claim.''
</P>
<P>
   Devens, a former Atlantan, says Exxon reneged on that promise,
and it doesn't surprise him. ``There was an arrogance that
permeated the spill that came from Exxon officials,'' he says.
``And they're still arrogant.''
</P>
<P>
   Devens is executive director of the Prince William Sound
Regional Citizens' Advisory Council, created in 1990 as an oil
industry watchdog group. It's funded by Alyeska Pipeline Service
Co., a consortium of seven oil companies, including Exxon.
</P>
<P>
   Alyeska maintains the Trans-Alaska Pipeline and operates the
Valdez Marine Terminal, where the pipeline ends and two tankers
load up daily with 62 million gallons of oil.
</P>
<P>
   Alyeska also operates what's considered the world's safest oil
tanker system. The Ship Escort/Response Vessel System costs $60
million annually, with 250 employees who work around the clock,
escorting tankers in tugboats and equipped with a spill response
vessel. Seven skimmer barges and miles of containment boom are on
call.
</P>
<P>
   Since the spill, the U.S. Coast Guard has received better radar
tracking equipment, and oil tanker captains now are tested for
alcohol.
</P>
<P>
   ``Prevention is the center of our focus,'' said escort/response
system engineer Pete Chapman. ``No one can guarantee that there'll
never be another oil spill, but at least we now have more devices
to suck, skim, mop, contain and corral it.''
</P>
<P>
   If other good has arisen from the muck, it includes new
standards and more wilderness land and tourism.
</P>
<P>
   The spill set a ``polluter pays'' precedent that led Congress to
enact tougher oil spill liability and to provide further protection
by requiring double-hulled oil tankers by 2015.
</P>
<P>
   The $900 million Exxon settlement led to 655,000 additional
acres of protected wilderness in the region. The recently opened
Alaska SeaLife Center in Seward, west of Valdez, was funded in part
with $26 million from the Exxon settlement. Part aquarium, part
research facility, the center is equipped to handle injured or
oiled marine mammals.
</P>
<P>
   And, in an odd twist, visits to Prince William Sound have soared
since 1991. Meanwhile, sports outlets keep popping up, attracting
``extreme'' skiers, sea kayakers, dog mushers and ice climbers.
</P>
<P>
   __
</P>
<P>
   A plump otter passes the day on its back, clam in paw, circling
the Arco tanker as the ship fills with black gold. It seems odd as
these two symbols of one of the world's most notorious man-made
environmental disasters freely share space.
</P>
<P>
   But such is the dual Last Frontier/Big Oil personality of
Alaska. Like an arranged marriage, it must work.
</P>
<P>
   No town knows this better than Valdez, where people either
operate their own business _ with a natural resource or tourism
bent _ or work for ``Uncle Al,'' the nickname for Alyeska. The oil
consortium, housed on a hill overlooking Valdez, employs about
one-fourth of the 4,000 residents. Its concrete complex is ground
zero for an engineering marvel: the Trans-Alaska Pipeline, which
took 70,000 workers, $8 billion and three years to construct. Oil
began flowing in 1977 and since then has accounted for 20 percent
of the nation's oil supply.
</P>
<P>
   Snaking 800 miles down from the North Slope's Prudhoe Bay in the
Arctic, about 1.2 million barrels of oil daily make the trip. About
$2 billion a year, or 85 percent of Alaska's revenue, is generated
from taxes and royalties on oil.
</P>
<P>
   When oil prices drop globally, Alaska feels it. In Valdez, the
oil terminal's property taxes make up 92 percent of the town's tax
base. But many folks around here can't separate the rich oil
business from what it wrought a decade ago: the nation's largest
oil spill.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish the oil pipeline never came to Valdez,'' Stephens says,
checking the lines on Glacier Spirit as he ties it up for the
night. ``The worst mistake we ever made was jeopardizing the bay.''

PULSIPHER RISES ABOVE INSULT AND INJURY TO BECOME A STARTER

<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX, March 20 _ Bill Pulsipher feels Kerry Wood's pain.
Pulsipher, however, has shed his own pain _ from his Tommy John
elbow to his exile from the New York Mets.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I ever wanted was to be a starting pitcher in the major
leagues, so having that opportunity is all you can ask for,'' said
Pulsipher, a starting pitcher with the Milwaukee Brewers.
</P>
<P>
   The road to the Brewers' rotation was filled with detours and
potholes. The most severe obstacle was the torn ligament Pulsipher
suffered in his left elbow in 1996 in a scenario that strikingly
resembled the injury that last week knocked out Wood, the Chicago
Cubs' young phenom, for at least this season. But Pulsipher
suffered a jarring ride through New York as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``In '95, when I first got there, it was my job,'' the
25-year-old left-hander said at the Brewers' camp. ``I was told all
through the minor leagues you're going to be the future, future,
future, future. Then you get injured and then they get a new
manager and everything changes. Suddenly you have a new future.
That was the first time in my life my future had to be
rearranged.''
</P>
<P>
   Pulsipher needed two years to recover fully from the elbow
injury, the one that required a ligament transplant a la Tommy
John's pioneering operation 25 years ago. When he returned to the
Mets, he found Bobby Valentine and no starting opportunity there.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bobby had a different agenda, I guess,'' he said. ``I guess I
fell out of favor.''
</P>
<P>
   When the Mets traded him to the Brewers last July 31, Pulsipher
was jolted.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you come up through an organization, with some of the
accolades, you expect to play with the organization for a long
time,'' he said. ``When I got called back up last year, the first
thing Dave Howard told me was welcome back for the next 15 or 20
years. What are you supposed to think?''
</P>
<P>
   The shock of the trade, however, has dissipated. ``It was time
for me to go,'' he said. ``I don't think I was wanted there any
more, so better to go somewhere you're wanted.''
</P>
<P>
   Phil Garner is delighted that he has Pulsipher. ``He is a breath
of fresh air,'' the manager said. ``He's refreshing. He's fun to
watch. I'd pay to watch him.''
</P>
<P>
   Pulsipher, who takes Prozac to ward off depression, passionately
enjoys pitching and reacts exuberantly to big plays.
</P>
<P>
   ``He does whatever hits his mind to do at the moment,'' Garner
said. ``He's not trying to show people up. He's just having a good
time and showing it. He's full of life, full of energy. Our ball
club needs some of that. We have a bunch of nice guys who sit
around and read books. That's fine; I like that. But I like to see
that adrenaline kick in once in a while.''
</P>
<P>
   Pulsipher was not so demonstrative during his lengthy
rehabilitation following his elbow operation. Wood faces a similar
period, Pulsipher said.
</P>
<P>
   ``His story is exactly what my story was,'' Pulsipher said. ``In
'95 I was shut down with two weeks to go in the season. `You have a
sprained ligament,' I was told. Last year Kerry Wood had a sprained
ligament. I knew last year it was just a matter of time before he
had `Tommy John.' ''
</P>
<P>
   A sprained ligament doesn't go away, Pulsipher said; ``it just
gets worse.'' Recalling that he was told to rehabilitate his
sprained ligament for six weeks, he said: ``I was told everything's
going to be fine; put this behind you. Three weeks into spring
training, your arm's killing you every day. You feel something pop
and it's time to go get it fixed.''
</P>
<P>
   Pulsipher said he was throwing from a mound about six months
after the April 1996 operation, but it took another year for him to
say he was 100 percent recovered. He expressed optimism that Wood
eventually would return to the mound and the performance level he
exhibited last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'll be pitching next year,'' Pulsipher said. ``I'm not sure
it will be in the major leagues, but he'll be pitching somewhere.
If he's lucky, he comes back in a year. If it's normal, it's going
to be a little more than a year. But there's no doubt in my mind
he's going to be back. He's only 21 years old.''
</P>
<P>
   Wood has acknowledged that his style of pitching, in which he
threw across his body, put additional stress on his elbow.
Pulsipher said he, too, had ``terrible mechanics.''
</P>
<P>
   ``My arm was dragging behind my body, which was putting stress
on my elbow,'' he said. ``But why fix it? Nobody was hitting me.
Are you going to make up something? What if you start getting hit?
You'd automatically go back to what works if you get in trouble.''

   Let Sosa Be Sosa
</P>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ Milwaukee Braves manager Phil Garner didn't like Todd
Stottlemyre's dislike of Sammy Sosa's gesture of bowing to the fans
last week after hitting a pair of home runs against the Arizona
pitcher. Sosa picked up the gesture while he was in Japan last
November.
</P>
<P>
   ``The players like to talk about entertainment, but they don't
entertain,'' Garner said. ``They just want to go play their game.
They don't want to acknowledge the fans. Show me another player in
the game who acknowledges the fans like he does. In Chicago he
sprints out there, runs from the right field line to center field,
and the fans go crazy. I wish Stottlemyre would do that. Walk out
on the mound and tip his hat, saying hello guys, get behind me.''
</P>
<P>
   The Brewers played an exhibition game in Mexico yesterday, but
Jim Gantner, one of their minor league coaches, informed the team
he couldn't cross the border. ``I don't have my gift certificate,''
he explained.
</P>
<P>
   This is the same Jim Gantner, who when he was the team's first
base coach was told by Garner to correct the problem of players
missing signs by working out an unmistakable hit-and-run sign for
runners on first base. One day Dave Nilsson was on first when
Garner flashed hit-and-run on two consecutive pitches only to have
Nilsson remain stationary at first.
</P>
<P>
   After the inning, Garner confronted Gantner.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gantner,'' Garner said, ``didn't I tell you to give him a
sign?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I did, I gave him the sign,'' the coach said.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's your sign?'' the manager asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``I winked,'' Gantner said.
</P>
<P>
   The problem: Gantner was wearing sunglasses.
</P>
<P>
   Blue Days for Blue Jays
</P>
<P>
   The Toronto Blue Jays are the only team since the 1977-78
Yankees to win successive World Series, but they have fallen on
hard times in recent seasons. The 1999 season hasn't even started,
and they have changed managers, becoming perhaps only the third
team to fire their manager in spring training.
</P>
<P>
   What malady has afflicted the Blue Jays? Ed Sprague, who was the
third baseman on the second World Series team and remained with the
Blue Jays through much of last season, offered his view.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they got caught up in not knowing whether to rebuild
or make a run for it,'' Sprague said. ``They've been caught in half
seasons. If the team isn't doing well at the All-Star break and
trade deadline, then they trade a guy. It started with the Cone
trade in '95. We traded for Cone in the spring, but by the end of
July we weren't in it and we traded him.
</P>
<P>
   ``After that we had a bunch of half seasons. If we weren't in
it, we'd trade and try to get a prospect or two in August or
September. That winter we'd go out and make a couple trades and be
competitive again. If that didn't work out by the next July, we
traded more prospects.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the early '90s we were always the team that went out and
traded for somebody. In '95, '96 and '97 we were the team that was
always trading somebody. They never had one year and said this is
our team, we're gong to go with these guys.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that's what hurt us. From an emotional standpoint,
players felt like if you went into July, you didn't known what
direction you were going to go.''
</P>
<P>
   Two Rings for the Price of One
</P>
<P>
   Jim Leyland got to have his ring and wear it, too.
</P>
<P>
   Leyland, who managed the Florida Marlins to the World Series
championship in 1997, recounted how he took his championship ring
and put it in a safety deposit box in a Pittsburgh bank, keeping it
for his son, Patrick, who is 7 years old.
</P>
<P>
   The ring thus did not adorn his hand when he had dinner with H.
Wayne Huizenga, then the Marlins' owner, late last season.
</P>
<P>
   ``He says I thought you liked your ring,'' Leyland related. ``I
said I love my ring. He said well how come you don't wear it? I
said I have it in a safety deposit box for my son. He said oh.
Well, three weeks later a guy from Huizenga Holdings walked in and
said here, Huizenga says wear your ring.''
</P>
<P>
   Sporting his second World Series ring, Leyland added, ``I
figured that anybody who would do that I better wear it in case I
run into him at a 7 Eleven.''
</P>
<P>
   American Baseball and Cuba
</P>
<P>
   A two-game exhibition series between the Cincinnati Reds and the
Los Angeles Dodgers in March 1959 marked the last time major league
teams played in Cuba, but they were not the last games American
teams played there.
</P>
<P>
   The Havana Sugar Kings played in the International League, one
of the Class AAA minor leagues, in 1960 and `61, before moving to
Jersey City, N.J., after Fidel Castro outlawed professional
athletes in Cuba. American players also played in the Cuban winter
league in the winter of 1959-60.
</P>
<P>
   Preston Gomez, a Cuban native, managed the Sugar Kings in the
1959 Little World Series between the winners of the playoffs in the
International League and the American Association. Gene Mauch
managed Minneapolis.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first two games were in Minneapolis,'' recalled Gomez, a
former major league manager and now a special assistant to the
Anaheim Angels' general manager. ``The weather was so cold both
league presidents decided to play the rest of the games in Havana
and the series went to seven games. We won the seventh game.''
</P>
<P>
   Gomez said Castro, who gained power in January 1959, visited
both clubhouses after each game and talked to the players and
managers. Contrary to Cuban mythology, Gomez said, Castro was not
pursued as a potential major league pitcher.

DUKE'S KRZYZEWSKI IS WORRIED; TEMPLE'S CHANEY IS AWED 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By FRANK LITSKY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ It will be Duke (35-1) against Temple
(24-10) Sunday afternoon for a berth in the Final Four of men's
basketball, and if you believe the rival coaches, both teams will
have a difficult time winning.
</P>
<P>
   Duke, the nation's top-ranked team, has won its last 30 games
and is a solid favorite. The Blue Devils are seeded first and
Temple sixth in the East regional of the NCAA tournament at the
Continental Arena.
</P>
<P>
   In Friday night's regional semifinals, both teams won
comfortably, Duke by 78-61 over Southwest Missouri State (22-11)
and Temple by 77-55 over Purdue (21-13). Duke's depth and
versatility impressed the near-capacity crowd of 19,233. Temple's
shooting and floor leadership were memorable, too. But the winning
coaches also saw the dark at the end of the tunnel.
</P>
<P>
   Duke played with endless energy. The sophomore Elton Brand, 6
feet 8 inches and 265 pounds, was a force inside, and when he was
double-teamed, which was often, the ball ended up with Trajan
Langdon, the senior shooting guard. Langdon finished with 24 points
and 8 rebounds, Brand with 14 points, 8 rebounds, 5 blocks and 4
steals. As Brand said, ``When Trajan plays the way he did, it takes
a lot of pressure off me.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Duke coach Mike Krzyzewski was not thrilled. Perhaps he
had been spoiled by Duke's 41-point victories in its first two
games in this tournament. This, he said, was not one of Duke's
better games.
</P>
<P>
   ``They beat us to loose balls,'' the coach said. ``They didn't
turn it over much. In the first half, it was a 2-point game, a
4-point game, and our defense wasn't that good. We played better in
the second half. We have more talent than they do and we should
have won. We hope we can play better Sunday.''
</P>
<P>
   Southwest Missouri State had never reached the round of 16
before, and coach Steve Alford warned his players that if they held
Duke in awe, they would be out of the game in 10 minutes. ``I told
them, `If we're going to get beaten, let's be aggressive,''' Alford
said. And they were.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we underestimated their quickness,'' said
William Fontleroy, Southwest Missouri State's junior guard.
``They're not a perfect team.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither is Temple, but John Chaney, in his 27th year as a head
coach, had his Temple team playing perhaps above its head.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm excited that our kids played as well as they did,'' Chaney
said. ``I'm as much surprised as everyone who has seen us play
before.''
</P>
<P>
   Temple made 52.7 percent of its shots, many off balance or from
far out. Mark Karcher, a 6-5 sophomore forward, sank 5 of 12
3-point shots and scored 21 points. Pepe Sanchez, an extraordinary
6-4 junior point guard from Argentina, broke up Purdue's pressing
defense and had 17 points, 9 assists, 6 rebounds and 6 steals.
</P>
<P>
   Chaney was afraid this performance was a one-time thing. Listen
to these responses at a post-game news conference:
</P>
<P>
   Q. Were you surprised the way your team shot?
</P>
<P>
   A. Very much surprised. I was also surprised we didn't play
better defense.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Can you shoot this well again?
</P>
<P>
   A. I don't know. Maybe one surprise leads to another.
</P>
<P>
   Q. What were you thinking when you were watching your players
shoot?
</P>
<P>
   A. That it's going to come to an end.
</P>
<P>
   So much for overconfidence.
</P>
<P>
   In the first half, the game turned on a freakish 10-0 run by
Temple in a 40-second span. It included one technical foul on
Jaraan Cornell of Purdue after a scuffle with Quincy Wadley and
another on Coach Gene Keady of Purdue for protesting that call too
much.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was one of those things where you try to stick up for your
players,'' Keady said. ``We all overreacted.''
</P>
<P>
   Temple was unshakable, but now it faces a monumental task. In
Krzyzewski's 18 previous seasons at Duke, his teams have won two
national championships and have played in seven Final Fours.
</P>
<P>
   Chaney has never led Temple to a Final Four, and as Sanchez
said, ``We practice at 5:30 in the morning because we want to get
there.''
</P>
<P>
   Chaney knows what his team faces. ``I've been excited and
completely awed watching Duke just play,'' he said. ``They've been
an unbelievable team. They've got mix-and-match parts in every
area. They've got a professional player under the basket and the
best shooting guard in the country.''
</P>
<P>
   If Chaney is not claiming victory, Temple supporters are. As the
Owls were closing out Purdue, their fans were chanting, ``We want
Duke, we want Duke.''
</P>
<P>
   Chaney responded to that with fatalistic humor. ``I don't want
to see Duke,'' he said. ``I've got to see them. Who wants to see
Duke?''  &QL;

FAMILY FOOTBALL SAGA: SAINT, SINNER AND SON 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By ROBERT H. BOYLE   
 (Robert H. Boyle is a special contributor to Sports Illustrated and
the author of ``The Hudson River: A Natural and Unnatural History''
and other books.)  
 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Kelly Sullivan was 6 years old when his mother, Gail, drove him
and his 10-year-old brother, Ramsey, to Clinton Prison in
Dannemora, N.Y., for their first family visit with their father.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph George Sullivan, inmate No. 82-A-5729, was a football
enthusiast serving two consecutive life sentences for three of the
30-some murders he can recall committing. Called ``the most
dangerous man in America'' and nicknamed Mad Dog by the FBI,
Sullivan was the only man to escape from Attica, and for the first
five years of family visits only Gail Sullivan and the two boys
were allowed in the visitors' compound when he was temporarily let
out of solitary confinement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every visit, I'd spend like four, five hours with Kelly and
Ramsey,'' Joe Sullivan said recently. He had his sons do push-ups,
sit-ups, 50-yard dashes, forward and backward crisscross drills,
and running and standing long jumps for at least an hour before
they played.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we didn't have a football, I used to put rags together
with towels and make it hard and then tie it. If we needed an extra
man, I used Gail. Until I was 50 years old, I was beating them in
the 50-yard dash. First Ramsey beat me, and I was thrilled. And
Kelly was always trying to catch up, first with me and then with
Ramsey. Then, when he was 16 years old, he was beating Ramsey at
20.''
</P>
<P>
   Kelly kept going. Last fall, as a 17-year-old running back, he
helped lead Monroe-Woodbury High School in Central Valley, N.Y., to
an unbeaten regular season.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's the best runner I've had in 22 years of coaching,'' said
Pat D'Aliso, the football coach at the school.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly Sullivan's football talent has continued to weave a bright
thread in the family tapestry, a poignant saga that sweeps through
the vicious underworld of crime and onto the fabled playing fields
of Notre Dame. It is football and the dream of Notre Dame that
unites Kelly, his father, Joe, and his great uncle, the first
Joseph George Sullivan.
</P>
<P>
   It is Kelly's great uncle _ his father's namesake _ who is the
family beacon; Uncle Joe Sullivan was a Notre Dame captain-elect
whose legend in South Bend places him alongside George Gipp and
Knute Rockne.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly, now 18, is well aware of the family's Notre Dame football
connection. His father made sure of that with both of his boys. ``I
told them how I was named after Joe,'' Joe said. ``I showed them
his picture, what a great player he was.
</P>
<P>
   ``I missed the boat, but Notre Dame was to be the family
tradition.''
</P>
<P>
   The boys got the message. ``He always told me to root for Notre
Dame because it was our team, that Uncle Joe went there,'' Kelly
said.
</P>
<P>
   Ramsey, who preferred baseball, added, ``We were told if you
wanted to play football, Notre Dame is where you wanted to go.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   They wanted to go there because of Uncle Joe Sullivan. Born in
1913 in New York City's Greenwich Village, one of eight children,
Uncle Joe went to St. Francis de Sales Parochial School in Queens
and served as an altar boy. He was the star tackle and captain of
the 1931 St. John's Prep team that defeated archrival Brooklyn Prep
for the first time in 12 years. Voted the outstanding city high
school athlete in 1932 and the national schoolboy shot-put
champion, he won a trip to the Olympics in Los Angeles and a
scholarship to Notre Dame.
</P>
<P>
   In his sophomore year in South Bend, Sullivan sat on the bench
and watched a senior all-American, Moose Krause, play left tackle
on both offense and defense in the days before two-platoon
football.
</P>
<P>
   ``And surely Krause was good enough to watch,'' columnist Bill
Corum wrote in The New York Evening Journal. ``But when the New
York Irishman finally got his chance as a junior, he soon made the
coaches forget even the powerful, potent Krause. Quiet and reserved
almost to the point of shyness off the field, Sullivan turned out
to be such a flaming fighter in action that when the time came to
elect a captain, he was the unanimous choice of the squad; the
recognized and accepted leader before the first vote was cast.''
</P>
<P>
   Sullivan was a superior player, but his presence went way beyond
football. ``Joe was one of the finest tackles ever at Notre Dame,
and that puts him in pretty classy company,'' said Wallace
Fromhart, now 84, who was quarterback and deep safety on the 1936
team. ``He was a wonderful kid, wonderful. Very humble, he never
bragged. He was very strong, and if he made a great play, he never
said anything because he believed that's what he was supposed to
do.''
</P>
<P>
   And here's where the legend begins: In January 1935, Joe came
down with pneumonia, then mastoiditis, and underwent surgery.
Students prayed for the recovery of Big No. 79, but on March 8, he
was rushed by train to New York Hospital, where he died March 20
after three operations for a brain abscess.
</P>
<P>
   His death, after that of Gipp in 1920 and Rockne in 1931, was
called the third major shock to Notre Dame football. Coach Elmer
Layden, the fullback for Rockne's Four Horsemen, and the other
Horsemen were among those who attended the solemn requiem mass;
Layden announced that an acting captain would be chosen for each
game in a season dedicated to Sullivan.
</P>
<P>
   On Nov. 2, with Notre Dame trailing undefeated Ohio State, 13-0,
before a crowd of 81,000 in Columbus, Layden invoked Joe's spirit
in his halftime pep talk. It was All Souls' Day, and Layden told
his players, ``You all know what today is, and Joe is surely
looking down on all of us.''
</P>
<P>
   In one of its greatest come-from-behind victories, Notre Dame
scored three touchdowns in the last quarter, two in the last three
minutes, the last one with seconds remaining, to win by 18-13.
Sullivan's father, Tim, a New York police lieutenant, was listening
to the game on the radio. Two days later, he had a heart attack and
died.
</P>
<P>
   Even though Ronald Reagan played the Gipper in ``The Knute
Rockne Story,'' his favorite story about the Fighting Irish spirit
was how the dead captain-elect had inspired the upset of Ohio
State. When Edward Sullivan, one of Uncle Joe's two younger
brothers who also went to South Bend to play football, first
arrived at Notre Dame, the Rev. John Cavanaugh, Joe's confessor and
later the university president, said: ``Eddie, never bother to read
`The Lives of the Saints,' for Joe was the greatest guy to come to
Notre Dame spiritually and physically. Just try to be half as
good.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The torch next passed to another Sullivan, Joe's namesake
nephew, born in 1939, the oldest son of his brother Gerard, a
decorated police detective, and his wife, Nora. There was no way of
knowing then that the boy would show his football moves only behind
bars as a legendary prison halfback. But when little Joe was 8, he
began sneaking down into the cellar of his grandmother's house,
where he would undo a taboo steamer trunk and, alert for footsteps,
would hold his uncle's high-topped cleats, blood-stained jersey and
battered leather helmet and dream of running out onto the field
under the Golden Dome.
</P>
<P>
   ``Grandma favored me just a bit, being her first grandson and
named after Uncle Joe to boot,'' Joe said. ``One Sunday, without
saying a word, she handed me a book, `All-Stars of Christ,' to the
shock of all my aunts and uncles because they never spoke about Joe
around her.
</P>
<P>
   ``The book went far beyond Uncle Joe's athletic prowess and
spoke of his gentle decency as a God-fearing man. Well, I have
failed miserably, and I disgraced his legacy long ago by not
becoming the man I planned to be, but an aberration.''
</P>
<P>
   Joe was 13 when his father died of cancer at age 36. Between his
mother's grief and her struggle for money, Joe went adrift. He
skipped school and ran away for weeks at a time. A chronic truant,
he was sent to a training school, ran away and was arrested for
stealing a car, and ended up in a reformatory and then prison. It
was the start of a long career of crime that included a conviction
for manslaughter in the second degree, a sentence of 20 to 30 years
and a trip to Attica, where he became a legend of another kind.
</P>
<P>
   In prison, Joe said, he ran 10 miles a day, did 2,000 push-ups a
day, pumped iron and went out for football during the days when
organized games gave inmates the opportunity for serious hitting
and wagering. He played 13 seasons of hard-rock prison football; in
one, he scored 32 touchdowns in 10 games. Sullivan's star status
could be measured the only way it counts in prison _ in cigarettes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guards bet thousands of dollars on those games,'' Joe
recalled. ``A guard would say, `Hey, Sully, play for us over here
in A-Block or C-Block.' Some of these guards offered me 20 cartons,
30 cartons to play for them. This is the money in there.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1971, urged on by bank robber Willie Sutton, who had cancer,
Joe took advantage of the tower guards who got bored in
escape-proof Attica. When they turned to watch a truck come through
the back gate, Joe shimmied up the 32-foot wall in 15 seconds on a
makeshift pole that other inmates dismantled the instant he jumped
to freedom. For five days, guards searched the 30 buildings within
the walls because, as the distraught superintendent explained in
published reports: ``I felt he simply couldn't have gotten out. I
still don't see how he could have gotten out.''
</P>
<P>
   Caught six weeks later in Greenwich Village, Joe was sent to
Clinton Prison. In 1975, the parole board agreed to release him if
he revealed how he had escaped from Attica. He said that he had
hidden under sacks in a departing truck; the parole board released
him.
</P>
<P>
   Outside, Joe took no-show jobs through mob connections, married
Gail Weiner, an account executive in a small advertising agency in
Manhattan, and worked for Fat Tony Salerno, boss of the Genovese
family. The job led to a series of killings, Joe said, and in 1982,
Joe was sent back to prison, this time for life, for three murders.
His sons were little more than toddlers: Kelly was 2 and Ramsey 6;
Gail was left to bring them up alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's two Joes, without a doubt,'' said Gail, now a teacher at
a public elementary school in the Bronx. ``There's the one in
prison and the other one who'd rather be home, a father and a
husband. He tries for us. That's why I love him.''
</P>
<P>
   Now 60, Joe Sullivan is in the Sullivan Correctional Facility, a
state maximum-security prison in Fallsburg, N.Y., in Sullivan
County. Gail, Kelly and Ramsey, a graduate of SUNY-Albany who is
planning to go to law school, visit him often. Gail supplements her
income by teaching computer programs in a New Jersey business
school and by teaching typing and word processing to inmates at a
federal prison near the family home in Monroe, N.Y. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Like their mother, both Kelly and Ramsey are Jewish. Kelly,
Ramsey, Joe and Gail each wear a gold necklace with a Star of David
enclosing a shamrock, and at Kelly's bar mitzvah, a friend gave him
an antique Notre Dame pennant, which hangs on his bedroom wall next
to an Irish flag.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly is terse when asked about what his father did.
``Obviously, it was wrong,'' he said. He is equally tight-lipped
when his peers ask where his father is and why. Kelly and Ramsey do
not talk about their father as a killer. ``It's in the past,''
Kelly said.
</P>
<P>
   With his friends, quarterback Andre McCleod and
linebacker-receiver Dave Colabella, Kelly spearheaded
Monroe-Woodbury's drive to the New York Class AA section
championship last season. Aided by his 4.4-second speed in the
40-yard dash, he set a school record of 1,450 yards rushing.
Although he broke his left hand and served mainly as a decoy in the
team's final two-and-a-half nonsection games before losing to Troy,
15-13, in the quarterfinals of the state championships, Kelly ended
the year with 16 touchdowns and 1,572 yards on 173 carries. ``It
was almost a first down every time he touched the ball,'' Pat
D'Aliso, the coach, said.
</P>
<P>
   Now 5 feet 9 inches and 175 pounds, Kelly is going to spend a
post-graduate year at The Kiski School in Saltsburg, Pa., to build
up his grades and body before attending college. A strict academic
school, Kiski numbers 54 all-Americans and 11 members in the
College Football Hall of Fame among its graduates. The headmaster,
John A. Pidgeon, said, ``His potential is considerable in view of
the fact that he's had so much pressure in his life and has
obviously come through it well.''
</P>
<P>
   Kelly's father would like him to renew the family ties to Notre
Dame. But with the years has come a certain flexibility in his
outlook. ``With what I've been through,'' Joe said, ``I just want
him to have a happy, decent life.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, the dreams of the father have made an impression on
the son. ``I want to go to Notre Dame,'' Kelly recently told his
mother, ``even if I can't play football there.'' &QL;

IOWA STATE WOMEN UPSET UCONN 
</HEADLINE>
   (Repeats for all needing)  
(mk) 
 By JERRY BREWER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CINCINNATI _ When it was over, when they had shocked the entire
nation and fiddled with the balance of power in women's basketball,
the Iowa State players celebrated beneath a 64-58 scoreboard. The
Cyclones huddled and bounced and hopped, a giddy group of winners
who had just done something almost no one had expected.
</P>
<P>
   They got hot at the right time against top-seeded Connecticut
Saturday in the Mideast Regional semifinals of the NCAA tournament
and bounced the disbelieving Huskies out into the cold. In the
process, the Cyclones denied the Huskies a sixth straight
30-victory season and, most important, a sixth straight appearance
in the final eight.
</P>
<P>
   Iowa State will play either second-seeded Clemson or
third-seeded Georgia Sunday for a chance to go to the Final Four.
</P>
<P>
   Down by 52-47 with five minutes left, Iowa State (25-7) made its
run. The Cyclones, the nation's second-best 3-point-shooting team,
finally started hitting their long-range bombs, something they had
not done until that point.
</P>
<P>
   The freshman forward Tracy Gahan began the surge with a
3-pointer from the right wing to pull Iowa State to 52-50 with 4
minutes 37 seconds left. One minute later, the junior guard Stacy
Frese hit one to trim the deficit to 54-53. Then, after the UConn
forward Svetlana Abrosimova missed a driving layup, the Cyclone
sophomore guard Megan Taylor hit a 3 to give Iowa State a 56-54
lead at the 2:19 mark.
</P>
<P>
   The Cyclones would never trail again. Another Frese 3-pointer
and two free throws preserved the victory as Connecticut misfired
when the Cyclones applied the pressure.
</P>
<P>
   For the top-seeded Huskies (29-5), a third straight sterling
regular season ended in postseason disappointment. For the third
straight season, UConn entered a regional heavily favored to
advance to the Final Four. Two years ago, a Tennessee team with 10
losses beat the Huskies in the last eight. Last season, an
unheralded North Carolina State team sent them home in the last
eight.
</P>
<P>
   Now, they head back to Storrs, Conn., even earlier. The pregame
chatter from the Huskies was that they were relaxed. They had put
that lackluster performance against Xavier in the second round
behind them. Their concentration and intensity level were different
now, the players said.
</P>
<P>
   And Connecticut seemed in control after it went on a 10-2
second-half run to turn a 37-36 deficit into a 46-39 lead _ its
biggest lead of the game _ at the 11-minute mark. The Huskies, for
the second game in a row, looked sluggish at the start, still
struggling with offensive execution, still looking like a team in
desperate need of a floor leader. UConn committed 13 turnovers in
the first half and entered the locker room with the score tied at
28-28, thanks mostly to the play of the freshman forward Tamika
Williams.
</P>
<P>
   The Huskies forced 11 turnovers and held Frese, Iowa State's
leading scorer at 17 points a game, to two points in the half. But
because of their own turnovers and poor first-half shooting (12 of
35, 34 percent), the Huskies were unable to capitalize.
</P>
<P>
   UConn's stars, Abrosimova and Shea Ralph, who entered the game
averaging a combined 34 points, had a combined eight points on
two-of-15 shooting at halftime. If not for the play of Williams, a
native of nearby Dayton, Ohio, the Huskies' struggles would have
been worse. Williams scored 12 points and was five of six from the
field in the half, including 10 points in the final 7:42 before
intermission.
</P>
<P>
   With UConn trailing by its biggest margin of the half at 18-12,
Williams scored five points during a 7-0 run that briefly reclaimed
the lead for the Huskies at 5:43.

 PLAYING IN OPPOSITE HALVES OF THE DRAW ARE GOOD FOR THE WILLIAMSES
AND THE GAME  (rk) 
 By   ROBIN FINN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   KEY BISCAYNE, Fla. _ The most ambitious sister act ever to
declare itself a sure bet for a total takeover of women's tennis
has developed complications consistent with a head-on collision:
Fifth-ranked Venus Williams and 16th-ranked Serena Williams are
gaining on an identical destination, the No. 1 ranking. Will one
have to mow down the other to get there? Their parents suspect so.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's complicated enough just to have one champion around the
house, but two, that's enough to break up a home,'' said Richard
Williams, the father Frankenstein who masterminded this double
assault, ``but there's no stopping these girls.''
</P>
<P>
   Richard Williams began coaching his two youngest daughters on
the pockmarked public courts of Compton, Calif., in their preschool
years. Tennis was their ticket to a bigger, better life, and each
sibling wanted in. This week at the Lipton Championships, where
Venus is the defending champion, both are seeded. To their father's
delight, they landed in opposite halves of the draw.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody else out there better start moving over for the
Williams girls, because they're pushing for No. 1 and No. 2 right
now,'' said Richard Williams, who predicts his daughters will
monopolize the tour. ``If tournament directors are smart, they're
going to see the way these girls sell tickets and make sure they
put them on different sides of the draw.''
</P>
<P>
   For him, a dream final and a nightmare final are one and the
same: his two teen-agers duking it out for a title. They began
their Lipton campaign Saturday, with 17-year-old Serena taking on
Alicia Molik, a qualifier from Australia, and 18-year-old Venus
facing American Tara Snider.
</P>
<P>
   Having long outgrown the complications of Compton, where
Williams made ends meet by running a security service, the family
now calls a sprawling compound in Palm Beach Gardens, Fla., their
happy home, not that they are home much anymore.
</P>
<P>
   First, the family launched Venus, a U.S. Open finalist on her
first try in 1997, and then came Serena, like her sister a
collector of two Grand Slam mixed doubles titles and currently the
owner of a tour-best unbeaten streak of 11 matches that yielded
consecutive titles in Paris and Indian Wells. Thanks to their
respective contracts with Reebok and Puma, neither sister has to
worry where her next pair of sneakers is coming from.
</P>
<P>
   Since one coach seemed insufficient for two rising stars,
Richard Williams and his wife, Brandi, have divided the coaching
duties between themselves the way garden variety families assign
household chores: a fearful flyer, Richard has allowed his wife to
handle most foreign events, including the Grand Slams, but he is
always a phone call away. Just in case the all-in-the-family
atmosphere threatens to become stifling, Nick Bollettieri
volunteers his opinion, and motivational expertise, whenever asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Richard has his system working, he listens to advice, but he's
done it all on his own,'' Bollettieri said. ``The sky's the limit
for those girls.''
</P>
<P>
   This season, aware that his daughters have demonstrated
fearlessness in all competitive situations except the ones
requiring them to tackle each other, Richard Williams is
experimenting with a policy of avoidance at most non-Grand Slam
events. It is his theory that his daughters will rack up titles
quicker, and with less psychological distress, if they know they do
not have to eliminate each other.
</P>
<P>
   The strategy for minimizing sibling stress had a smash debut
last month: Venus made a successful defense of her first career
title in Oklahoma City, and Serena, to the surprise of everyone but
her family, won her first title at Paris in her first career final.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The Williamses are the first pair of sisters to win separate
titles on the same day and the first sisters since Bulgaria's
Maleevas _ Katerina, Manuela and Maggie _ to rank simultaneously
inside the top 20. Serena Williams broke into the top 20 last week
in Indian Wells by winning the Evert Cup.
</P>
<P>
   At Indian Wells, Venus acted as Serena's doubles and training
partner but steered clear of the singles draw. Though both entered
the Lipton, the sisters will be back in experimental mode in two
weeks at the Bausch and Lomb Championships on Amelia Island, where
Serena will take a back seat while Venus navigates the main draw.
According to their father, they do not mind trading off, but he is
not so sure he may not have an insurrection on his hands if he
takes his theory to extremes.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it turns out that having them both playing singles in all
the Slams hurts their results this year, I may start doing
something different in the year 2000,'' he said. ``I may allow both
of them to play just two Slams. We'll see about how they feel about
that one.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, the siblings have kept their rivalry to a simmer: Venus
has beaten Serena in both meetings, then apologized. ``I think
Venus, when she puts her mind to it, is the most gifted female ever
to play the game,'' Richard Williams boasted. ``The only one who
even comes close is Martina Navratilova.''
</P>
<P>
   Venus Williams has played along with his sound track, announcing
there is nothing that is beyond her. ``I believe I can do
anything,'' she said, her eyes daring anyone to defy her, little
sister included.
</P>
<P>
   But lately, the little sister has not been listening. ``I always
believed I can beat the best, be the best, achieve the best,'' said
Serena after downing Steffi Graf in the Indian Wells final. ``I
always see myself in the top position.''
</P>
<P>
   May the best sister win. &QL;

METS' PROSPECT ESCOBAR HAS THE LOOK OF A FUTURE STAR 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By   JASON DIAMOS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORT ST. LUCIE, Fla. _ Watching players, some of them barely out
of high school, on Friday afternoon, it was hard to imagine that
anyone on the remote field at Dodgertown in nearby Vero Beach was
anywhere close to a year and half away from the major leagues.
</P>
<P>
   Here, Single A ball seems all the more removed from the majors
than just in name, even if the field in question is, literally,
only a few fields away from the stadium in which the Dodgers play
their exhibition games. But then a 20-year-old center fielder in a
blue and orange Mets uniform lopes to his right to run down a
well-hit ball in the gap between left and center, making a tough
play look effortless, turning what could have been extra bases into
an easy out.
</P>
<P>
   A few innings later, the same player _ now at bat _ drills a
pitch off the right-center-field fence against a blowing wind. His
long, graceful and powerful strides propel him to a stand-up
triple.
</P>
<P>
   And it soon becomes clear why assistant general manager Jim
Duquette, who oversees the Mets' minor league operations, said: ``I
don't like timetables. But if everything goes the way we think,
Alex could be in the major leagues in two years. Maybe one and a
half.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps Alex Escobar's countryman, Edgardo Alfonzo, put it best.
At 25, Alfonzo is already one of the better players to come out of
Venezuela. But when he is asked about Escobar _ who was born in
Caracas and grew up in Valencia _ Alfonzo's eyes widen. ``Oh,
man,'' Alfonzo said. ``He's going to be one of the best players
ever from Venezuela. I'll tell you that right now.''
</P>
<P>
   And to think, Escobar is coming off his first full season in the
minor leagues. Or that Escobar had only one home run and eight
stolen bases in parts of two injury-plagued professional seasons
(he had hamstring problems) before exploding for 27 homers, 91 runs
batted in, 49 stolen bases and a .310 average for Single A Capital
City last summer.
</P>
<P>
   But it was still the lower ranks of Single A. Baseball America,
the trade magazine, ranked him the 11th-best prospect in baseball.
In terms of outfielders, that placed Escobar third. Neither
Duquette nor Mets general manager Steve Phillips would say that
Escobar is the best prospect in his organization. ``But, other
periodicals rate him that way,'' Duquette said. ``And I wouldn't
disagree with them.''
</P>
<P>
   One National League scout rated Escobar as a potential impact
player in the majors. ``This was the best player I've seen at this
level all year,'' his report said.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, the Mets, who signed Escobar at 16 for
$80,000, feel the same way. Duquette mentioned two of the brightest
young outfield stars in the National League today when discussing
Escobar: 23-year-old Vladimir Guerrero, and soon-to-be 22-year-old
Andruw Jones.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not talentwise, even though some people feel that Alex is a
combination of the two,'' Duquette said. ``But in how quickly they
moved through the system.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones broke into the majors at 19, climbing from Single A to
Double A to Triple A to the Atlanta Braves _ all in 1996. Guerrero
did the same in the Montreal Expos' organization in 1996 at age 20,
and he skipped Triple A.
</P>
<P>
   Is Escobar's throwing skills in the same league with Guerrero's
rifle-like arm?
</P>
<P>
   ``Not that good,'' said Escobar, who did throw out an overly
ambitious runner trying to stretch a single into a double on
Friday. ``But it's getting close.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Like Jason Tyner, the Mets' baby-faced first-round pick in last
summer's draft, there is some question as to where Escobar will
play once he reaches the majors. But unlike Tyner, there is no
question that Escobar _ who, at 6 feet 1 inch and 188 pounds, looks
so much more mature than the rail-thin Tyner, even with his hair
cropped close to his scalp _ can handle center field.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only way you take him off a premium position like that is
if you have a prototype player there,'' Duquette said. ``Someone
like Kenny Lofton or Brett Butler. And we think Tyner could be that
type of player.''
</P>
<P>
   If Tyner is, the Mets feel that Escobar could glide from his
natural position in center to right field as easily as Escobar
shifts from his native Spanish to English when conversing with his
teammates.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the only position I've played since I was little,''
Escobar said.
</P>
<P>
   Tyner is scheduled to start the season with Double A Binghamton.
Escobar, who learned English in high school, is to begin the year
with Single A St. Lucie. When the weather warms up in the north, he
will head for Binghamton.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets will be watching the progress of each player closely.
Their projected starting outfield this season _ Rickey Henderson,
Brian McRae and Bobby Bonilla _ could all be gone in two years. And
nobody knows if Bonilla's health will even allow him to play that
long, meaning the Mets could be grooming Escobar, Tyner and perhaps
the often-injured Jay Payton as their outfield of the future.
</P>
<P>
   Part of that future looked especially bright at Dodgertown on
Friday, as Escobar displayed the five tools that scouts look for _
the ability to hit, hit for power, run, field and throw _ in one
afternoon. Scouts do caution that Escobar needs to cut down on his
strikeouts (Escobar fanned 133 times in 112 games last season).
Still, the Mets like what they see.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to get a big head, and go from prospect to
suspect,'' Escobar said. ``I just want to be me every day.''
</P>
<P>
   If Escobar continues to develop for the Mets, that should be
more than enough. &QL;

   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ It will be Duke (35-1) against Temple
(24-10) Sunday afternoon for a berth in the Final Four of men's
basketball, and if you believe the rival coaches, both teams will
have a difficult time winning.
</P>
<P>
   Duke, the nation's top-ranked team, has won its last 30 games
and is a solid favorite. The Blue Devils are seeded first and
Temple sixth in the East regional of the NCAA tournament at the
Continental Arena.
</P>
<P>
   In Friday night's regional semifinals, both teams won
comfortably, Duke by 78-61 over Southwest Missouri State (22-11)
and Temple by 77-55 over Purdue (21-13). Duke's depth and
versatility impressed the near-capacity crowd of 19,233. Temple's
shooting and floor leadership were memorable, too. But the winning
coaches also saw the dark at the end of the tunnel.
</P>
<P>
   Duke played with endless energy. The sophomore Elton Brand, 6
feet 8 inches and 265 pounds, was a force inside, and when he was
double-teamed, which was often, the ball ended up with Trajan
Langdon, the senior shooting guard. Langdon finished with 24 points
and 8 rebounds, Brand with 14 points, 8 rebounds, 5 blocks and 4
steals. As Brand said, ``When Trajan plays the way he did, it takes
a lot of pressure off me.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Duke coach Mike Krzyzewski was not thrilled. Perhaps he
had been spoiled by Duke's 41-point victories in its first two
games in this tournament. This, he said, was not one of Duke's
better games.
</P>
<P>
   ``They beat us to loose balls,'' the coach said. ``They didn't
turn it over much. In the first half, it was a 2-point game, a
4-point game, and our defense wasn't that good. We played better in
the second half. We have more talent than they do and we should
have won. We hope we can play better Sunday.''
</P>
<P>
   Southwest Missouri State had never reached the round of 16
before, and coach Steve Alford warned his players that if they held
Duke in awe, they would be out of the game in 10 minutes. ``I told
them, `If we're going to get beaten, let's be aggressive,''' Alford
said. And they were.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we underestimated their quickness,'' said
William Fontleroy, Southwest Missouri State's junior guard.
``They're not a perfect team.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither is Temple, but John Chaney, in his 27th year as a head
coach, had his Temple team playing perhaps above its head.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm excited that our kids played as well as they did,'' Chaney
said. ``I'm as much surprised as everyone who has seen us play
before.''
</P>
<P>
   Temple made 52.7 percent of its shots, many off balance or from
far out. Mark Karcher, a 6-5 sophomore forward, sank 5 of 12
3-point shots and scored 21 points. Pepe Sanchez, an extraordinary
6-4 junior point guard from Argentina, broke up Purdue's pressing
defense and had 17 points, 9 assists, 6 rebounds and 6 steals.
</P>
<P>
   Chaney was afraid this performance was a one-time thing. Listen
to these responses at a post-game news conference:
</P>
<P>
   Q. Were you surprised the way your team shot?
</P>
<P>
   A. Very much surprised. I was also surprised we didn't play
better defense.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Can you shoot this well again?
</P>
<P>
   A. I don't know. Maybe one surprise leads to another.
</P>
<P>
   Q. What were you thinking when you were watching your players
shoot?
</P>
<P>
   A. That it's going to come to an end.
</P>
<P>
   So much for overconfidence.
</P>
<P>
   In the first half, the game turned on a freakish 10-0 run by
Temple in a 40-second span. It included one technical foul on
Jaraan Cornell of Purdue after a scuffle with Quincy Wadley and
another on Coach Gene Keady of Purdue for protesting that call too
much.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was one of those things where you try to stick up for your
players,'' Keady said. ``We all overreacted.''
</P>
<P>
   Temple was unshakable, but now it faces a monumental task. In
Krzyzewski's 18 previous seasons at Duke, his teams have won two
national championships and have played in seven Final Fours.
</P>
<P>
   Chaney has never led Temple to a Final Four, and as Sanchez
said, ``We practice at 5:30 in the morning because we want to get
there.''
</P>
<P>
   Chaney knows what his team faces. ``I've been excited and
completely awed watching Duke just play,'' he said. ``They've been
an unbelievable team. They've got mix-and-match parts in every
area. They've got a professional player under the basket and the
best shooting guard in the country.''
</P>
<P>
   If Chaney is not claiming victory, Temple supporters are. As the
Owls were closing out Purdue, their fans were chanting, ``We want
Duke, we want Duke.''
</P>
<P>
   Chaney responded to that with fatalistic humor. ``I don't want
to see Duke,'' he said. ``I've got to see them. Who wants to see
Duke?''  &QL;

 By ELIZABETH BECKER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Among the defense secretaries of the last half
century whose pictures on magazine covers decorate a drab corridor
of the Pentagon, one stands out. It is not George Marshall, the
``Man of Crisis'' on a 1950 U.S. News &AMP; World Report, or Caspar W.
Weinberger, who wonders ``How to Spend a Trillion'' on a 1981 Time
cover.
</P>
<P>
   It is William S. Cohen, the current secretary of defense, who
shares the front of Parade magazine with his wife, Janet Langhart
Cohen, under the headline, ``Two For America.''
</P>
<P>
   That portrait is not just another example of Cohen's famous
sentimentality. (True, the former Republican senator, who married
three years ago on Valentine's Day, has written, among other
things, an ode to the F-15 fighter jet.) The headline is an apt
description of a rare public relations campaign by the husband-wife
Cohen team. With public appearances, musical events and Mrs.
Cohen's new weekly television show broadcast to armed forces bases
around the globe, the Cohens are on a mission to bridge the gap
between the civilian and military cultures.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Cohen has undertaken a role that is almost unheard for a
Cabinet spouse, even one known as the first lady of the Pentagon.
</P>
<P>
   But for Janet Cohen, 56, it is just the latest interesting twist
in a 30-year television career, though the first time she has
worked free.
</P>
<P>
   While courts the civilian world, beating the drum for increasing
military pay as well as the military budget, Janet Cohen acts as a
one-woman morale booster for the armed services.
</P>
<P>
   With all the high-voltage emotion that was her professional
trademark as anchor, correspondent and talk show host at ABC, NBC,
CBS and Black Entertainment Network, she tells the troops they are
``awesome,'' that the country appreciates their hard work and that
they should keep at it.
</P>
<P>
   Think part Eleanor Roosevelt, part Oprah Winfrey.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mission is to support Bill,'' Mrs. Cohen said in an
interview last week. ``He's the passion of my life, and it's
impassioned me about our military people.''
</P>
<P>
   Seated in her penthouse apartment with wraparound balconies
overlooking Pennsylvania Avenue, she said: ``My role just evolved
on my travels with Bill where we talked about the need for the
country to reconnect with the military, to let them know the fine
job they're doing, how we're all in awe of our military.''
</P>
<P>
   In the last two months she has started her weekly television
series, ``Special Assignment,'' for the armed services
international broadcast network, in which she interviews civilian
and military leaders. Her first subject was President Clinton,
aboard Air Force One, and she has lined up Tom Cruise, Hollywood's
``Top Gun,'' and Gov. Jesse Ventura of Minnesota, for later
programs.
</P>
<P>
   With her husband, she recently was the host of a ``Pentagon
Pops'' musical salute to the military performed by military
musicians at Constitution Hall. At the event, Cohen said the show
came about because ``Janet simply asked, `Why not the best music
for the best military in the world?' ''
</P>
<P>
   By the end of the month she will have her own Web site.
</P>
<P>
   Her volunteer efforts are not just a vanity project, Pentagon
officials say, but a high-profile effort to bolster recruiting
goals that have proved out of reach despite plans to raise military
pay by more than 4 percent, with bonuses of about 10 percent, and a
national nostalgia for the patriotism of World War II started by
the movie ``Saving Private Ryan.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not easy when we're competing against one of the most
vibrant economies in history,'' Mrs. Cohen said. ``And that means
holding onto the families, too, by giving them good housing, pay,
retirement, medical care and education for their kids.''
</P>
<P>
   While this is the basic boilerplate message of her husband, the
same points, when made in front of the troops by Mrs. Cohen, a
former model and one of the first African-American women to break
into national television, seem more like entertainment, and that
has earned her high marks in some serious circles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Raising the esprit de corps is critical, which is why what
she's doing is so worthwhile,'' said Michael O'Hanlon, a military
analyst at the Brookings Institution.
</P>
<P>
   Kati Marton, who is writing a book on ``First Couples'' and is
part of a power couple with Richard C. Holbrooke, whose nomination
as ambassador to the United Nations is pending in Congress, said of
Mrs. Cohen: ``What she's doing is very much in keeping with that
activist engaged role that Eleanor Roosevelt pioneered. She is
essential to her husband's well-being and his job, and she is
taking a full role in both.``
</P>
<P>
   Reared in the housing projects of Indianapolis by a single
mother, she studied at Butler University and Indiana University but
quit when she won a $500 beauty contest in Chicago. That led to
modeling jobs in Chicago and then her big break as the weather
woman on a Chicago television station.
</P>
<P>
   After that she was the host of the morning program ``Indy
Today'' on an Indianapolis television station, then moved to a
network affiliate in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was very, very lucky,'' Mrs. Cohen says. She had been
married twice when she began dating Cohen, who was then a senator
from Maine and who also was divorced.
</P>
<P>
   They married shortly before Cohen, now 58, was named defense
secretary in late 1996. She is now running Langhart Communications,
teaching corporate executives how to handle the news media. But she
also has traveled with her husband to Spain and Bulgaria, to the
Middle East and South Korea. Whenever she visits the troops, she
mingles with them, eliciting the whoops and yells normally
associated with movie stars, not politicians' wives.
</P>
<P>
   ``You hear the national anthem, you go to the bases, and it has
a different feeling,'' she said. ``I get very emotional.''
</P>
<P>
   The most ambitious of Mrs. Cohen's projects is the Special
Assignment segments for the 156 stations of the armed forces
international network overseas and replayed on videotape on the
bases in the United States. She started the series this month with
her 30-minute interview of Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Her toughest question was, `Sir, with all due respect, you
offered the highest budget proposal in a long time _ ever. But is
it enough when you talk about the things we're asking of them to
do?''
</P>
<P>
   After agreeing that nothing was too good for the military, the
president was steered by Mrs. Cohen to describe the idealism of the
troops who helped the Central American victims of Hurricane Mitch
and served as peacekeepers in Bosnia, as well as their sacrifices.
He needed little prompting.
</P>
<P>
   In her weekly interviews, Mrs. Cohen says she will be mining
that strain of idealism as she invites members of the armed
services, celebrities, business leaders and politicians to make
what she calls ``testimonials on air'' for the military.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen sees nothing but good in her efforts.
</P>
<P>
   ``She touches people,'' he said in an interview. ``She can
infuse them with a sense of real spirit. As to the difference she
is making, out in the field, every single leader that I meet, the
first question is, `Why didn't you bring your wife?' ''

 SPORTS COLUMN: JARVIS AND O'BRIEN MEET AT CROSSROADS OF AN
INCREDIBLE JOURNEY  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By WILLIAM RHODEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   KNOXVILLE, Tenn. _ After each of his victories in the last two
weeks, Mike Jarvis has referred to St. John's voyage through the
NCAA tournament as an incredible journey. For Jarvis and Ohio
State's Jim O'Brien, this journey borders on a miracle.
</P>
<P>
   Last season at this time, Jarvis and O'Brien could not have been
farther from the Promised Land. O'Brien had finished 8-22 in his
first season at Ohio State, good for last place in the Big Ten.
Jarvis was in Washington completing a
familiar-but-not-so-incredible journey at George Washington. The
Colonials had been knocked out of the NCAA tournament _ again.
Jarvis began to face a wrenching reality: His team was merely gator
bait, a delectable morsel for larger programs with greater
resources.
</P>
<P>
   At 53, Jarvis was beginning to wonder how long he would be
chasing the carrot. Not only would GW not reach the hallowed
mountaintop, but getting to the base of the mountain was also a
chore. Jarvis was caught between two cliches: good things come to
those who wait, and create your own breaks.
</P>
<P>
   O'Brien, who left Boston College after 11 seasons after a
dispute with the administration, hoped for revival and resilience.
A season later Jarvis and O'Brien, 48, are on the coaching
equivalent of cloud nine. St. John's and Ohio State played Saturday
night in the South Regional final. St. John's had an opportunity to
reach the Final Four for the first time since 1985; Ohio State for
the first time since 1968.
</P>
<P>
   It's odd how their paths have crossed on this journey.
</P>
<P>
   ``I grew up rooting for St. John's,'' the Brooklyn-born O'Brien
said. ``St. John's recruited me when Lou Carnesecca was coaching
there.''
</P>
<P>
   From 1978 to 1985, Jarvis, as head coach at Cambridge Rindge and
Latin, coached some of the best high school players in the nation.
His last year at the Boston high school was the year when St.
John's reached the Final Four. The player who wrecked St. John's in
that national semifinal game was Patrick Ewing, the best high
school player Jarvis coached. It was in his capacity as the Rindge
and Latin head coach that Jarvis first met O'Brien, an assistant at
the University of Connecticut who was recruiting Carl Hobbs at the
time.
</P>
<P>
   When O'Brien became the head coach at Boston College in 1986,
Jarvis was beginning his second season as head coach at Boston
University. From 1986 to 1990, O'Brien and Jarvis competed in the
same city. While the two had a cordial relationship off the court,
there was no on-court relationship.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was interested in playing us,'' O'Brien recalled on Friday.
``We had no interest in playing them.''
</P>
<P>
   Jarvis, who also played against Jim Calhoun's teams at
Northeastern, understood the pecking order and scheme of things.
This is the food chain in Boston: Celtics, Boston College, Boston
University. ``I wouldn't have played BU if I was at BC, either,''
Jarvis said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   So, 12 years later, Jarvis and O'Brien finally got to play.
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, this season has been more like a crusade for
Jarvis. A season of settling old scores. He is playing teams that
once routinely had eaten the likes of Boston University and George
Washington for appetizers, and he is now playing them with a
formidable arsenal of players. Ron Artest, a versatile
6-foot-7-inch forward, and Erick Barkley, a wiry and efficient
point guard, are all-America-caliber talents that Jarvis never had
access to at Boston University or George Washington.
</P>
<P>
   For O'Brien, who had access to players at Boston College but
felt he lacked the support of his bosses when it came to flexible
admissions, Ohio State represents unlimited potential. Scoonie
Penn, the leader of his backcourt, played for O'Brien at Boston
College, then followed him to Ohio State.
</P>
<P>
   Last weekend, Jarvis punished Indiana and gave Bob Knight's team
a clinic on zone defense and transition basketball. On Thursday,
Jarvis' team routed Maryland, a program that always cast a huge
shadow over George Washington. In each instance, Jarvis underplayed
personal rivalries and stuck with his Incredible Journey script.
It's not about vengeance, not about ``Me vs. Him,'' no Jarvis vs.
Calhoun or Jarvis vs. Williams or Jarvis vs. O'Brien. In fact,
Jarvis said that this season, St. John's run was not about reaching
the Final Four or even winning the national championship.
</P>
<P>
   While his players talk about staying focused and winning it all,
Jarvis described his goals in much broader terms.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kids look at the destination, more than an older person like
me who looks at the journey,'' he said. ``These kids decided right
away where they wanted to go; they knew where they wanted to get. I
wanted to take the ride. And I'm still on the ride. These guys are
focused on destination. I'm a journey guy.'' &QL;

   Low scores at midterm
</P>
<P>
   By Curtis Bunn
</P>
<P>
   C. 1999 Cox News Sercie
</P>
<P>
   The Year of the Brick reached its midway point this weekend, and
it's a wonder a record was not set for cracked backboards. Masonry
work reigns in this postlockout, freaky 50-game season. And one
more thing was clear through the flying particles: The NBA
championship is as wide open as it's been since, well, Michael
Jordan retired to pursue baseball in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   There are many factors in teams' cockeyed shooting, not the
least of which is defensive schemes so intricate and thorough it
would boggle the mind. For instance, films of opponents are so
finely broken down that Team A knows exactly how many times Team B
starts its offense on the right side, how many dribbles a player
probably will take before raising for a shot, what angle passes to
the post come from and just about anything else but how many times
a player chews gum before taking a free throw.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, the NBA has no secrets. Defense dominates, which
means the club that can put together enough offense amid the
bumping and grinding has the best shot at winning.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of it's the late start (to the season), some of it is
that guys just don't shoot as well anymore,'' Miami coach Pat Riley
said. ``And then there's defenses and physical play. Teams lock in
on people and situations. It's not easy to score in this league.''
</P>
<P>
   That was never more apparent than this season. No team has an
average as high as 100 points per game, and the league average is
just over 91 points. Compare that with 10 years ago, when the NBA
average was 109.2 points, with 24 of 25 teams scoring more than 100
a game.
</P>
<P>
   This year, the combined shooting average was 43 percent going
into the weekend, 48 percent in 1989. Eighteen teams' shooting
percentage was less than 44 percent. Even foul shooting was down
from 10 years ago, from 76 to 72 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Knicks scored just five points in the third quarter
against Chicago two weeks ago. The Hawks had a stretch of home
games where they scored 68, 73 and 73 points, respectively.
Virtually every club set or approached some sort of record for
offensive futility.
</P>
<P>
   Which helps create a wide-open race for the title. There is no
apparent front-runner in either conference. Most impressive has
been the Utah Jazz, which won the Western Conference last year. But
the ever-changing Los Angeles Lakers, with Glen Rice in the fold
and _ presumably _ Dennis Rodman, have the talent and depth to make
a serious challenge.
</P>
<P>
   ``No more excuses,'' center Shaquille O'Neal said.
</P>
<P>
   Then there are the Portland Trail Blazers, who have meshed
nicely under first-year coach Mike Dunleavy. Once considered
enigmatic, the Blazers have been stunningly efficient _ and
explosive. The rest of the pack in the West, including Houston and
San Antonio, seems to lack the necessary firepower.
</P>
<P>
   In the East, the Indiana Pacers seem to have stepped back from
last year, when they took Jordan's Bulls to seven games in the
conference finals. There's little fire there. The Pacers seem a
year older.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Riley's Heat could be at the top of the class. Miami
plays unrelenting defense and unselfishly on offense.
Significantly, they have a clutch point guard in Tim Hardaway who
can create off the dribble at the end of tight games.
</P>
<P>
   No other team established itself in the season's first half.
Detroit, Orlando, Atlanta and New York represent a second tier that
appears to be more pretender than contender.
</P>
<P>
   All this parity should make for an interesting playoff run in
May. It's uncertain who will win the title in June, but it's pretty
certain they'll do it after shooting poorly.
</P>
<P>
   MIDSEASON REPORT
</P>
<P>
   ROOKIE OF THE HALF
</P>
<P>
   Boston's Paul Pierce (right). For his overall game, Pierce gets
the nod over the spectacular Vince Carter of Toronto. Carter is a
thrill a minute who has to work on his jumper and defense.
</P>
<P>
   COACH OF THE HALF
</P>
<P>
   Miami's Pat Riley. With two starters out all season, Mr.
Slickback has somehow fashioned a club that held the best record in
the East going into the weekend. His team believes in his
philosophy of defense and unselfishness and plays with a passion
and pride.
</P>
<P>
   SURPRISE TEAMS
</P>
<P>
   Portland, Philadelphia, New Jersey. Any team with Isaiah Rider
on it is primed to implode at any time, yet the Trail Blazers have
led the Pacific Division from the start. Most surprising is that
they're doing it with team ball. The 76ers, led by Allen Iverson,
have emerged as a tough defensive club and challenger in the
Atlantic. Below them are the Nets, who hope to reverse their
fortunes after getting Stephon Marbury.
</P>
<P>
   MOST IMPROVED
</P>
<P>
   Minnesota's Joe Smith (left). The former No. 1 pick looked like
a spent fighter last year _ dazed and lifeless with Golden State.
But he's been a force inside teaming with Kevin Garnett, making the
loss of Tom Gugliotta less of a big deal.
</P>
<P>
   MVP THUS FAR
</P>
<P>
   Shaquille O'Neal. Over the years, O'Neal has taken his hits for
having interests outside of basketball. The Lakers all-star center
contended he was not fazed by the criticism, that he would
persevere. And guess what? He has.
</P>
<P>
   So drastic has O'Neal's growth been in the last two years that
he is the stabilizing force on a Lakers club that seems primed for
an NBA championship. And it all evolves around O'Neal, who might be
selected the league's MVP if the vote were held at the season's
midway point.
</P>
<P>
   Significantly, O'Neal's success goes beyond his gaudy averages
of 28 points, 13 rebounds, 3 blocks. Additionally, The Diesel has
functioned as team leader and spokesman; he even speaks at times
with emotion and not that irritating monotone. It's clear now more
than ever that he's playing to win championships.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing more, nothing less. When he bolted Orlando as a free
agent for the Lakers, critics said that if he really wanted to win
he would have continued his tandem with guard Penny Hardaway.
</P>
<P>
   However, many people did not realize that wherever O'Neal went
would become contenders or that the Lakers were more loaded than
Orlando. Now, at 27, O'Neal is on the cusp of something great
because he's holding things together on the court and in a locker
room diseased by Dennis Rodman.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal has been admirable as players around him either come and
go or struggle to find their niche. Others who have been
outstanding so far this season: Philadelphia's Allen Iverson,
Utah's Karl Malone, Miami's Alonzo Mourning, Seattle's Gary Payton.
But none has been more valuable than O'Neal.

 &HT;    NBA WEST: Shaq blasts Sager
 &HT;    By Jeffrey Denberg
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Lakers' Shaquille O'Neal is levying harsh criticism at NBA
reporter Craig Sager of TNT.
</P>
<P>
   ``Craig Sager's a liar,'' O'Neal said after a Sager report
claimed that Lakers players voted 12-0 to fine Dennis Rodman for
leaving the team to go to Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any votes that go down are called by the (players' team)
president, handled by the president and tallied up by the president
_ me. There were no votes. I don't know what ... Craig's talking
about.
</P>
<P>
   Lakers coach Kurt Rambis said the TNT report is just another
part of the tabloid haze that surrounds Rodman.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's crazy,'' Rambis said. ``That's ludicrous. First of all,
we handle our disciplinary problems internally through management.
Players are given a set of rules. They don't determine who gets
fined or anything like that. They don't have a say in it.''
</P>
<P>
   Humbling experience
</P>
<P>
   The world has turned upside-down for Dennis Scott, waived by the
Knicks eight days ago, then signed Wednesday to a 10-day contract
by Minnesota. ``Nine years ago, I'd watch people come in for 10-day
contracts, and I thought I'd never have to go through something
like that,'' Scott said. ``But my mother used to say that life
isn't the destination _ it's the journey and how you survive it.
Right now I'm fighting and pushing. I know I can do well, I can
still put up some good numbers. Hopefully, I can do that here.''
With Anthony Peeler and Malik Sealy ailing, T-Wolves coach Flip
Sanders gives Scott typical 10-day billing: ``He's been around, and
he knows how to play. It's really a matter of how he feeds off of
the other players.''
</P>
<P>
   Three who are free
</P>
<P>
   No. 7 Lorenzen Wright (Clippers), No. 9 Samaki Walker (Dallas)
and No. 10 Erick Dampier (Golden State, via Indiana) are the picks
among the top 10 from the 1996 draft who did not sign extensions
before last week's deadline. As a result, they become free agents
July 1.
</P>
<P>
   Models of consistency
</P>
<P>
   St. Patrick's Day marked the first anniversary of Denver's last
road victory, at Washington. Going back to the end of 1996-97
season, the Nuggets have lost 66 of their last 69 road games. They
are 0-12 this season, were 2-41 last season, and finished 1996-97
winning only one of their final 16 road games. Their current road
losing streak is up to 19. They have lost 29 of the last 30 on
road. ... Opposite end of the spectrum: The Utah Jazz has gone 94
games without losing two straight. That dates back to Nov. 20,
1997.
</P>
<P>
   Not-so-great Scottie
</P>
<P>
   Scottie Pippen shook the Rockets' world by complaining about his
discomfort with the offense. In truth, coach Rudy Tomjanovich has
rewritten the plays to include Pippen, calling his favorites and
adjusting them to Pippen's specifications. But the Rockets also
have charted the results, and the plays that begin with Charles
Barkley posting up have resulted in field goals or fouls more than
twice as regularly as anything designed for Pippen. Although Pippen
is Houston's best defender and passer, he has shown an alarming
inability to finish.

   The Kings hope Oliver Miller is ready to turn his life around.
Team president Geoff Petrie said Miller will remain at the Red
Mountain Spa in St. George, Utah, until he reaches a weight
mutually agreed upon. ``We gave him a goal weight, and he's
hopefully working toward that,'' Petrie said. The 6-foot-9 Miller
weighed more than 350 pounds when he reported. He claims, ``I'm
ready to play. I know my body fat has dropped from 26 percent to 16
percent. My fat mass was at 94 and now it's at 74. All I know is, I
feel a lot better.''

KENTUCKY SENT MIAMI PACKING BY CONTAINING SZCZERBIAK 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By   JACK CURRY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS _ Wally Szczerbiak could not rescue Miami University
one more time. He could not keep his and Miami's magical journey
through March alive, not by himself. That is really what it
amounted to as Szczerbiak and four sometimes invisible teammates
fought a deep Kentucky team and lost, 58-43, Friday night. The
matchup was a mismatch.
</P>
<P>
   Szczerbiak was the premier player on the court, but Scott
Padgett was almost his equal and the Wildcats proved that they were
the premier team with smothering defense and more than enough depth
to outlast the one-dimensional Redhawks.
</P>
<P>
   It was an awful experience for Miami of Ohio, which could have
made the game much more competitive if someone not named Szczerbiak
occasionally slashed to the hoop or drilled a jumper.
</P>
<P>
   So it is the team with the best players, not the team with the
best player, which marched through the semifinals of the Midwest
Region to oppose first-seeded Michigan State on Sunday. The
Spartans slogged past 13th-seeded Oklahoma, 54-46, in a game that
even Michigan State's Mateen Cleaves called ugly.
</P>
<P>
   The ugliest moment came as Cleaves and Eduardo Najera collided
when Najera set a screen and both crumbled to the floor. It was a
gruesome sight, but both returned to play and Cleaves, who has a
bruised forehead, will start on Sunday. In the prettier contest,
Padgett had 17 points, including 14 in the second half and 12
during one dazzling streak that destroyed Miami. If the Wildcats
(28-8) beat Michigan State (32-4), they will scamper into the Final
Four for the fourth consecutive season and will be trying to snatch
their third title in that period.
</P>
<P>
   Padgett and third-seeded Kentucky prevailed. Like Oklahoma
(22-11), Szczerbiak and 10th-seeded Miami (24-8), which has now
lost 18 straight to the Wildcats dating to 1927, went home.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you have any competitiveness in you and you know the guy
that you're going to be guarding is talked about as the man, you
got to take it personally a little because you got to have some
pride,'' said Padgett, about playing against Szczerbiak. ``Yeah, I
took it personally.''
</P>
<P>
   Szczerbiak finished his glorious career with 23 points, only
eight of which came after intermission. Padgett and Jamaal Magloire
were the two players who defended him most often.
</P>
<P>
   The Wildcats were very physical with Szczerbiak and much more
open to letting him shoot jumpers. Szczerbiak, who went 8 for 16
from the field, was stymied by Kentucky's constantly shifting zones
and the Wildcats obliterated the screens that Miami sets to get
Szczerbiak open. The other players on Miami (24-8) were a gory 6
for 28 from the field. Only two other Redhawks had more than two
points.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just trying to do whatever it took to keep us in the
game,'' said Szczerbiak. ``Unfortunately, it wasn't enough.''
</P>
<P>
   A dejected Charlie Coles, Miami's coach, said: ``I hoped we
would have played well if we lost. I don't think we did.''
</P>
<P>
   How one-dimensional were the Redhawks? Another player did not
score a field goal until there was 2:50 left in the half. It was
obvious that Szczerbiak needed to have a tremendous game to even
keep the contest close.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew Wally was going to get his points,'' said Padgett.
``We wanted to play good team defense and make other people make
the plays for them. I know this is crazy to say, but he only got 16
shots. I guess we limited him a little.''

<P>
   If an angler subdues a large trout, and there is no one there to
see it, did it really happen? Or, more to the point, will any of
the angler's friends believe it?
</P>
<P>
   ``Not bloody likely,'' I thought recently, after I landed a
22-inch rainbow in the exquisite Arroyo Verde of Patagonia in
southern Argentina. I yelled as loudly as a man who has been
surprised by a tiger. ``Dick! Javier! Yo! Guys!''
</P>
<P>
   I cradled the fish, holding it by its flanks, moving it back and
forth to revive it as my cohorts answered my alarm.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nice fish,'' Dick Moore said. Dick is my neighbor in Brooklyn,
N.Y., and though a lifelong fisherman, he had, to that point, been
a desultory fly-rodder. But in the course of six days arranged by
an old fishing pal, one of Patagonia's pioneering outfitters, Jorge
Truco of San Martin de los Andes, I saw the lure of this sport hook
Dick as surely as my hopper had lodged itself in that rainbow's
jaw.
</P>
<P>
   We stayed at the Estancia Quemquemtreu, an immense ranch in the
high desert region of Patagonia. The estate managers, Paula and
Martin Zimmerman, are quintessential Argentinians: good-looking and
with style to burn (they can elevate blowsy pants, a beret, and a
scarf to Astaire-like elegance). Quemquemtreu livestock provided
the fare for meals of broiled meat prepared over the wood fire and
iron grill _ the hallmarks of Argentine ranch cookery. Paula's
garden yielded squash, tomatoes, onions, lettuce and herbs.
</P>
<P>
   On our first morning, Dick and I were driven by our guide,
Javier Panutti, to a private stretch of the Chimehuin, a brawling
freestone river where the legendary Bebe Anchorena had once taken
the world record dry-fly brown trout and the world record wet-fly
brown. Off in the distance, the dormant volcano, Lanin, reared over
the plain.
</P>
<P>
   We pulled into a field, and as we did, a small herd of red stag
and two guanacos (a relative to the llama) bolted away. Javier led
us across a series of braids and channels, not unlike the Madison
River of Montana. We fished only at the head of runs or in
well-oxygenated riffles. A long, dry, hot spell sent the trout to
colder or, failing that, well-aerated water.
</P>
<P>
   On our way through the bankside grass, we had kicked up a lot of
grasshoppers. I tied on a hopper imitation. Dick, who was just
beginning to get his casting together, stayed with wet flies. We
both caught plenty of fish. Most satisfying to me was a rainbow
that required a cast to the limits of my 4 weight rod. I reached
out to the spot, 60 feet away, where Javier directed me. With a
whole channel's worth of strong current between rod and fly, the
cast had to be on the money. I would get, at most, two feet of
drag-free float.
</P>
<P>
   The trout struck with a wallop, leaping out of the water and
sprinting downstream in the fast current. I pulled back as hard as
my tackle would allow. The fish turned and finally surrendered. An
18-incher that Javier unhooked and revived.
</P>
<P>
   For the next four days, we sampled the waters within a two-hour
drive. When a thunderstorm clouded up the Collan Cura, normally a
good dry-fly river, a chance encounter at the yearly agricultural
fair in the nearby town of Junin led to an invitation to the Arroyo
Verde, a stream of great clarity and wary fish. Wherever we went,
though, we were pursued by the cast-bedeviling winds that the
Mapuche Indians call Puelches. Their steady gale lasted for days,
but wind is an omnipresent fact of life in fly-casting.
</P>
<P>
   On our last morning, Javier took us to a little river, the
Quilquihue. Its course through a few miles of tall fir trees
promised some relief from the Puelches. I walked downstream. I took
a half-dozen good trout. I was hungry and my thoughts turned to a
final meal in Junin where Senor Buamscha, a second-generation
Lebanese restaurateur whom I had met a dozen years ago, served up
smoked red stag and slabs of grilled meat.
</P>
<P>
   I made my way upstream to Dick, who was casting in midpool.
Since there was nothing happening, I was about to tempt him with my
visions of a final gaucho feast. For some reason I didn't, and I am
glad.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, Dick,'' I said, ``they're only going to be at the head of
the pool.''
</P>
<P>
   Pointing to the left side of a V formed by the current, I asked
him to cast to the crotch of the V, where a trout cooperated by
striking. Dick, the trout and I were all caught off guard when the
trout rose.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cast a little further upstream,'' I said.
</P>
<P>
   Another fish struck, and Dick landed him, a handsome rainbow:
the first fish he had taken on a dry. His cast looked crisp and in
control.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've probably alerted all the fish in that arm of the
current,'' I said. ``Walk up alongside it and cast over it to the
other part of the V.''
</P>
<P>
   A nice cast and an upstream mend gave his hopper a good float.
Wham! A terrific rainbow hit and rocketed into the air _ once,
twice, three times _ as it fled to the depths of the pool. Dick
fought it patiently and landed his best fish of the trip.
</P>
<P>
   ``It can't get any better,'' Dick said. ``We might as well leave
on a high note.''

 EXPERTS AND TEAMMATES SEE JETER GROWING AS A PLAYER AND A
LEADER  (ART ADV: Photo is being sent to NYT photo clients.
Non-subscribers can make individual purchase by calling(rk) 
 By   BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TAMPA, Fla. _ It is a testament to Derek Jeter that his peers
will project his future greatness, estimate how big of a star he
will become, or try to guess what his place in history will be.
</P>
<P>
   Baseball veterans typically frown on such conjecture, for their
game is relentlessly demanding and challenging and they know almost
all young players will wilt.
</P>
<P>
   But peers are sure Jeter will be exceptional for a long, long
time. The Yankees' shortstop will receive his second championship
ring next month. He has averaged nearly 200 hits per season. He has
finished third in the most valuable player balloting. He is among
the game's most popular players. He is only 24 years old.
</P>
<P>
   What will he be when he's 35? ``An unbelievable star,'' said
Darryl Strawberry. ``He could be as big as Michael Jordan, because
he's got a level head, he's a good kid, he knows how to play the
game, he's not afraid, he's not intimidated and he's handsome as
ever. And he's in New York.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Paul O'Neill: ``He has a chance to be a Hall of Fame
player. He's got that much time in his career, and that much
talent.''
</P>
<P>
   That much talent, in all those things that make a star.
</P>
<P>
   Tony Gwynn, the eight-time batting champion from the San Diego
Padres, had a moment to pause at second base during the postseason
last year and turned to Jeter. ``You just keep doing what you do,''
Gwynn said.
</P>
<P>
   Gwynn believes that Jeter has a terrific approach at the plate,
that inside-out swing that allows Jeter to smash the ball through
the right side or up the middle, with results.
</P>
<P>
   He averaged 192 hits a season in his first three full seasons,
and clearly is improving _ he had 203 hits in only 149 games in
1998, batting .324. If Jeter remains healthy and plays another 14
seasons, averaging 190 hits a year, he would finish his career with
approximately 3,250 hits.
</P>
<P>
   Jeter does need to learn the strike zone better, Yankees coach
Willie Randolph said, and refine his aggressiveness. ``If he does
that,'' Randolph said, ``that's scary.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeter had 119 strikeouts last year, but there is this: He batted
.235 with two strikes, or 42 points higher than the league average
in that situation, evidence of how Jeter cuts down his swing and
tries to put the ball in play. ``It's an old-fashioned approach to
hitting,'' said Joe Torre, the Yankees' manager. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Jeter is not muscular in the manner of Jose Canseco or Mark
McGwire; he doesn't have the steel-mill chest. But he is very
strong _ last year, Jeter became the first right-handed hitter in
the history of Yankee Stadium to hit the ball in the upper deck in
right field, and he and Strawberry and Bernie Williams probably hit
the most home runs in batting practice.
</P>
<P>
   ``He doesn't realize what kind of power he has,'' Strawberry
said. ``Being a home run hitter is a natural thing, and he has the
natural ability to hit home runs. He has a natural swing for
becoming a 30-home run hitter. He's going to get stronger each
year.''
</P>
<P>
   Said one American League scout: ``You see him learning how to
pull the ball more and more, and when he does, he'll hit 30 to 40
home runs a year.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Jeter has the quickness and the speed to steal bases, and he's
gaining the requisite knowledge. Jose Cardenal, the Yankees' first
base coach, thinks that as soon as Jeter acquires confidence in his
base running _ fearlessness _ he will steal 40 to 50 a year, ``or
maybe more.''
</P>
<P>
   Cardenal remembered how in his rookie year, Jeter was thrown out
stealing third in a situation where he shouldn't have been running;
the fallout made Jeter more cautious. ``He can't be worried about
making a mistake,'' said Cardenal. ``Even when the other team
thinks he's going to go, he's got to go, anyway _ just develop that
attitude.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeter increased his stolen bases from 14 to 23 to 30 in his
first three years, and intends to run more. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Defensively, Jeter gained the consistency the Yankees wanted
from him, reducing his errors to nine last year; he did not make
his first throwing error until June 20. To Muser and others, Jeter
already ranks among the game's best shortstops.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he can get better,'' said Randolph, who is the infield
coach. But, he added that Jeter has developed more quickly than he
expected. ``He still needs to learn to anticipate a little better,
to get a little bit better jump,'' said Randolph.
</P>
<P>
   Last season, Jeter curbed a habit of shuffling forward and to
his right slightly as a pitch was made, and he was in better
position to make more plays. With greater anticipation _
understanding the hitters, understanding how they will hit the ball
on certain counts _ Randolph thinks Jeter will get to more balls,
to his left, in particular, and to his right.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always been a consistency guy,'' said Randolph. ``You've
got to show me more than two or three years. How is he going to be
in lean years? How would he be with a different manager? I don't
anticipate fall-off with him, because he's a hard worker, but every
spring I try to challenge him and say, `You've got to take it to
the next level.''' &QL;

 TAMPA: next level.''
<TEXT>
<P>
   Jeter played alongside Don Mattingly for just a few weeks at the
end of the 1995 season, but Mattingly left Jeter a keepsake. At a
time when the Yankees held spring training in Fort Lauderdale,
Fla., Jeter and Mattingly finished a workout on a back field one
afternoon, all alone.
</P>
<P>
   Some of their teammates were playing an exhibition game, others
already were done for the day, and now Mattingly and Jeter were
headed back to the clubhouse, as well. The stadium was completely
empty; there was nobody around _ no fans, no coaches, no one except
for two exhausted, sweating ballplayers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's run in,'' Mattingly told Jeter. ``You never know who's
watching.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeter remembers vividly how they ran back to the clubhouse,
side-by-side, through the empty ball park, just because it was the
right thing to do.
</P>
<P>
   Mattingly was a captain, perhaps the player most responsible for
creating the intensely professional and respectful culture that has
been cultivated in the Yankees' clubhouse _ and Jeter likely will
be the keeper of the flame for years to come, as Torre and pitcher
David Cone and many others believe.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not intimidated by any situation,'' said catcher Joe
Girardi, ``and to be a leader, you have to be like that. He's well
respected. He's able to make light of a lot of situations, to keep
guys relaxed.''
</P>
<P>
   Last September, when pitcher David Wells gestured disgustedly
after Jeter and two others let a pop-up fall between them, Jeter
yelled to Wells from his position that, hey, that kind of stuff
isn't acceptable on this team _ a 24-year-old lecturing a 10-year
veteran, and in the mind of others on the club, Jeter said exactly
what needed to be said at precisely the right time.
</P>
<P>
   Jeter naturally pulls in some of the fringe personalities on the
team: he gave a nickname to Hideki Irabu, the only Yankee who
speaks his own language, and he is friends with the shy and
reserved Ramiro Mendoza. ``He doesn't push himself on people, or
claim a leadership role,'' Cone said. ``It just sort of happens.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Like his fellow shortstops Nomar Garciaparra and Alex Rodriguez,
Jeter is already among the game's most recognizable figures, one of
its symbols of excellence. ``He's exactly what baseball needs, a
young player, talented, who really, he communicates exactly what
this sport is,'' said Bud Selig, baseball's commissioner.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Rosner, an executive vice president for Integrated Sports
International, a company that deals in marketing, says that so long
as Jeter stays with the Yankees and the Yankees continue to be
successful, Jeter could develop into the city's biggest Madison
Avenue star ``in a couple of decades, since Reggie''
</P>
<P>
   Jeter, too, has a chance to be the first athlete to achieve a
$200 million contract, now that basketball has a salary cap. He
could be a free agent at age 27, before the prime of his career.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a remarkable start to his career,'' Cone said. ``There's
no reason to believe he can't be in the upper echelon of all-time
great Yankee players.'' &QL;

EWING IS BACK IN KNICK LINEUP,   BUT IT'S STILL THE SPREWELL SHOW  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By SELENA ROBERTS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Latrell Sprewell was blinking, buzzing and glowing
like a neon sign on a deserted road Saturday. For miles and miles
of this game, there was just Sprewell and no one else on the floor.
</P>
<P>
   Patrick Ewing was nearly invisible in his return. Allan Houston
and Larry Johnson were part of the background scenery as Sprewell
bolted off the bench late in the first quarter and stirred the New
York Knicks out of their malaise for a simple 96-78 victory against
the Boston Celtics at Madison Square Garden.
</P>
<P>
   Sprewell came in when Ewing looked a little out of sync in his
first game back in two weeks, and when the Knicks were struggling
to keep pace with the frenetic Celtics. Instantly, the game turned
as Sprewell began running and driving and dunking, collecting 18 of
his 27 points in the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks were on wheels, with Marcus Camby, who grabbed a
season-high 15 rebounds, and Chris Childs (7 assists) flying
alongside of Sprewell. The Knicks ended the game with a 46-42
rebounding advantage and found some revenge after losing in Boston
three weeks ago. They turned the ball over 26 times in that game,
but just 11 times Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The Celtics were led by Ron Mercer's 19 points.
</P>
<P>
   Popular thinking held that Ewing's return to the lineup after
missing six games with Achilles' tendinitis would mean a return to
the languid side for the Knicks. But Sprewell would not stand for
it.
</P>
<P>
   Practically ignoring Ewing's presence, Sprewell turned the game
into a one-on-five affair in an electrifying display in the first
half. Once Sprewell arrived with five minutes left in the first
quarter, and his team trailing by 5 points, Ewing shot once more
before coach Jeff Van Gundy took him out at the start of the second
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   That was when the Knicks really found freedom on the wings of
Sprewell. With Camby and Childs as partners in his uptempo style,
Sprewell began leaking out on the breaks and finding easy dunks on
cross-court passes. He was slicing inside of Antoine Walker and
Paul Pierce to draw fouls and tap in put-backs. Then, off a miss by
Houston with four minutes left in the half, Sprewell darted toward
the baseline, grabbed the ball and took a leap inside of Kenny
Anderson for a dunk as he was being fouled.
</P>
<P>
   It was all Sprewell, all the time. Not only did he score 9 of
his 21 first-half points in the 14-3 run that sent the Knicks into
halftime ahead, 55-45, but he aggressively handled Mercer, who had
danced away from Houston to score 12 first-quarter points. Mercer
was shut down by the omnipresent Sprewell.
</P>
<P>
   The lead Sprewell set up for his teammates in the first half was
pushed to 73-57 by the starters with four minutes left in the third
quarter. Then Sprewell arrived again, and the Knicks' lead swelled
to 80-60 by the end of the third.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of pushing the Knicks toward chaos _ which is what they
did three weeks ago in Boston, where they humiliated the Knicks,
90-84, and forced 26 turnovers _ the Celtics were being pressed
into 16 turnovers before the third quarter was over.
</P>
<P>
   In this kind of game, with Sprewell's energy level off the
charts, the Knicks did not need to lean on their star center.
Ewing, who took six shots before Sprewell took over, ended the
first half 2 of 7 and with a scowl on his face. At one point toward
the end of the second quarter, he appeared to scold Houston for not
passing to him.
</P>
<P>
   If Ewing's pride was wounded, it did not matter. That Johnson
was 0 for 3 and Houston was 2 for 6 was also of little consequence.
The Knicks were off and running with Sprewell in the first half.
</P>
<P>
   Even as the Knicks maintained their roll in the third quarter,
Van Gundy was most likely taking little comfort in it. If the
Knicks had established anything in the first half of the season, it
was their inability to sustain a good feeling from one game to the
next.
</P>
<P>
   It was that inconsistency that had left Van Gundy shaking his
head more than a few times as the Knicks hit the halfway point of
the shortened season Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know where we're at or where we're heading,'' Van
Gundy said. ``I don't have a great feeling for it with as many new
people as we have. Really, that's where I'm at. Not knowing their
personalities and characteristics, I don't know if we are going to
get better as the year goes on, tougher, or if a little adversity
is going to get us sideways.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's more a statement of not knowing our team. I could have
had a better idea in the past years.''
</P>
<P>
   REBOUNDS
</P>
<P>
   After spending his career as a starter and reaching all-star
status at Golden State, Latrell Sprewell reluctantly has gone along
with being a sixth man for the Knicks. Coach Jeff Van Gundy is
aware of the asides Sprewell has mumbled to indicate his
displeasure with the position. ``I would like him to be more
accepting, but I can understand it,'' said Van Gundy, who has used
Sprewell off the bench because it gives the Knicks balance and an
injection of energy. ``That he is less than pleased, I would expect
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever irritation playing off the bench has caused for
Sprewell, he has been playing heavy minutes and producing in his
role. Van Gundy did not rule out moving Sprewell into the starting
lineup _ the role the Knicks originally envisioned for him _ if the
team continues to play inconsistently ... The Celtics rookie Paul
Pierce reinjured his ankle two days ago, and did not start
Saturday. In Boston's 94-80 victory against the Knicks on Feb. 26,
Pierce scored 24 points.

VALENTINO MAZZIA, STUDENT OF DEATHS UNDER ANESTHESIA, DIES AT 77  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif. )   By RICHARD SEVERO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Valentino D.B. Mazzia, who was a pioneer in the
investigation of operating room deaths in New York and who also
served as chairman of the department of anesthesiology at the New
York University School of Medicine, died on March 10 at Mount Sinai
Hospital. Mazzia, who held degrees in medicine and law, was 77 and
lived in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Michael Baden, the forensic pathologist and a longtime
friend, said Mazzia died of cirrhosis of the liver caused by
hepatitis C, which he contracted years ago in his work as an
anesthesiologist. He had received two liver transplants, Baden
said.
</P>
<P>
   From 1961 to 1972, before he turned to law, he worked with Dr.
Baden and under Dr. Milton Helpern, who was then New York's City's
Chief Medical Examiner. Baden said that Mazzia's work led to
improvements in anesthesiology and surgical procedures in operating
rooms around the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``His greatest contribution was helping to create the specialty
of forensic anesthesiology by actually going to the scene, which
was the operating room, to see if something went wrong,'' Baden
said. ``He would go in and say, `You can't use this room until it
is checked out,' if there was a death. He investigated on the spot
and not later from a file.''
</P>
<P>
   Mazzia was born in New York City on Feb. 17, 1922, the son of
Alexander Mazzia and the former Francesca D'Alessandro. A 1943
graduate of City College, he earned his medical degree from New
York University in 1950. He taught at Cornell University Medical
School from 1952 to 1961. He was chairman of the anesthesiology
department at New York University in the '60s.
</P>
<P>
   He then became interested in the legal aspects of medicine, and
in the early 1970s he earned a law degree from the University of
Southern California and a doctorate in jurisprudence from the
University of Denver in 1978. For the next two decades, he worked
as a malpractice lawyer, mostly in New York and in the South.
</P>
<P>
   From 1971 to 1973, Mazzia was director of anesthesiology at the
Los Angeles County-Martin Luther King Jr. General Hospital, and he
practiced medicine in the 1970's in Bakersfield, Calif., and in Las
Vegas, Nev.
</P>
<P>
   Mazzia was a consultant in several well-known criminal cases. He
worked with the prosecution in the second murder trial of Dr. Carl
Coppolino, in Naples, Fla., in 1967. Dr. Coppolino, charged with
killing his wife with a muscle-relaxing drug, was convicted of
second-degree murder and sentenced to life in prison; he was
granted parole in 1979.
</P>
<P>
   Mazzia was also a consultant with the defense in the trial of
Dr. Mario E. Jascalevich in Hackensack, N.J., in the late 1970s.
Jascalevich, known as Dr. X before he was publicly identified, was
acquitted of murdering three patients with another muscle relaxant,
curare.
</P>
<P>
   Mazzia's survivors include his wife, Rosana; a brother,
Alexander L., of Palos Verdes Estates, Calif.; a sister, Leticia L.
Kahrilas of Placentia, Calif., and three children from a previous
marriage.

HERE'S HOW SPORTS SHOULD GIVE OUT OSCARS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MIKE FISHER AND RICHIE WHITT 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PricewaterhouseCoopers has tallied the votes. The red carpet has
been rolled out. Joan Rivers' fashion fangs are bared.
</P>
<P>
   The only thing missing from tonight's 71st Academy Awards is a
splash of sports.
</P>
<P>
   It would seem a natural marriage between sports and movies, two
of this nation's primary pastimes. Unfortunately, Hollywood is more
interested in ``the smell of napalm in the morning'' than the smell
of the locker room, and more fascinated by DeMille and De Niro than
by DeBartolo or DeClercq.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, there are some ties. Best actor nominee Tom Hanks (Saving
Private Ryan) once portrayed a female-league baseball manager in A
League Of Their Own. And his best actor foe Nick Nolte (Affliction)
once played a football wide receiver in North Dallas Forty. And the
director of best picture candidate Shakespeare in Love is _ wham! _
John Madden.
</P>
<P>
   Oh. Different John Madden? Never mind.
</P>
<P>
   If only the world of movies were more reflective of the world of
sports. Oscars Gamble, Robertson and De La Hoya would be leading
men, and movies like The Waterboy _ actually about Texas Motor
Speedway vice president Eddie Gossage dispelling rumors that his
track is leaking, then calling off qualifying for the Texas 500
because of seepage, would receive more respect from the Academy for
their hidden sports subplots.
</P>
<P>
   With the desire to meld sports and movies, here are the
Star-Telegram's nominees we'd like to see take home awards tonight.
And the winner, and our own special runner-up, is ...
\Nsubheds:Best picture Doctor Doolittle: After blowing into town
atop a cloud of his own verbal bluster, Mavericks GM Don Nelson and
his Ph.D. in basketball fail to back up his words.
</P>
<P>
   One True Thing: The New York Yankees win the World Series in the
sequel to the flop One False Thing in which the Rangers promised to
score multiple runs in a series against New York. \Nsubheds:Best
director Six days/Seven nights: Tom Schieffer nervously counts the
hours until catcher Pudge Rodriguez arrives at spring training to
officially denounce his leadership skills.
</P>
<P>
   The Thin Red Line: A black-clad Ken Hitchcock gives a chilling
performance in this examination of the underworld that is the NHL's
illegal two-line pass. \Nsubheds:Best actor The Man in the Iron
Mask: Suspenseful drama depicts the postseason misery of Stars
goalie Ed Belfour, who violently checks to see if in-the-crease
opponents are wearing Iron Cups.
</P>
<P>
   The Horse Whisperer: Tragic tale of a freak vocal chord injury
that renders loquacious Broncos tight end Shannon Sharpe
speechless. Almost. \Nsubheds:Best actress The Parent Trap: Gymnast
Dominique Moceanu does backflips after reclaiming her fortune and
winning her legal independence from a domineering dad.
</P>
<P>
   Hillary &AMP; Jackie: The seedy story of the ladies Carmen Electra
found in hubby Dennis Rodman's hotel suite. \Nsubheds:Best
screenplay _ original The Negotiator: NBA union chief Billy Hunter
fights for a fair deal but winds up sending players into a league
where nobody shoots straight and small-market teams can't afford to
keep their players.
</P>
<P>
   Gods and Monsters: Spine-tingling thriller in which Cowboys
owner Jerry Jones details his draft-day plans to pick a god (but
only if he plays like a monster) and a monster (but only if he acts
like a god). \Nsubheds:Best original score A Perfect Murder:
Nebraska's baseball team scores more than Warren Beatty in its
record rout of Chicago State, 50-3.
</P>
<P>
   Deep Impact: Meteoric rookie Randy Moss shakes the NFL with a
tidal wave of bombs that lead the Vikings to a record 554 points.
\Nsubheds:Best foreign film You've Got Mail: If it's addressed by
the International Olympic Committee and you're a potential host
city, the package is likely to contain cash, plane tickets and

</P>
<P>

legal system by keeping his football team in perpetual motion and

   Pleasantville: The Broncos' back-to-back Super Bowls colorize
previously blase Denver until John Elway's retirement creates a
sudden Mile-High Armageddon. \Nsubheds:Best short film Out of

IN SUBURBAN HOUSING MARKET, ONLY DIRECTION IS UP 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.J., Conn.)  (lb) 
 By DENNIS HEVESI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   By just about any measure, 1998 was quite a year for the
residential real-estate market.
</P>
<P>
   ``A Mark McGwire housing economy,'' was the way James Hughes,
dean of the Rutgers University School of Planning and Public
Policy, put it, ``like hitting 70 home runs.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Essentially, for the housing industry,'' Hughes said, ``all
the economic and demographic stars were in full alignment.'' So,
whether viewed from a national, regional or local perspective, a
lot of people bought houses _ despite near-pandemic price
increases.
</P>
<P>
   In the suburban arc around New York City, every one of 577
ZIP-code areas in 14 counties saw prices increase last year,
according to repeat-sales figures compiled by Case Shiller Weiss,
which surveys housing prices nationally. The year's performance was
so strong that observers and interpreters of the market are
debating its sustainability.
</P>
<P>
   Lifting off from a launch pad of solid economic fundamentals _
low inflation, low unemployment, low and very stable mortgage rates
_ the industry set records:
</P>
<P>
   The 4.78 million sales of existing homes in the United States
last year broke the previous record of 4.21 million sales set in
1997, which had broken the previous record of 4.08 million sales
set in 1996, according to the National Association of Realtors.
``You're talking 550,000 more homes sold last year than in 1997,''
said Fred Flick, chief economist for the association. ``That's a
pretty sizable increase.''
</P>
<P>
   The sale of 888,000 newly constructed homes last year broke the
national record of 819,000 set in 1977, according to the Census
Bureau. ``You had all regions going full throttle,'' said Steven
Berman, a statistician for the bureau's residential statistics
branch. ``The Midwest set a record of 166,000 new homes sold. The
South set a record, 397,000. The West had its third best year ever,
244,000. And the Northeast had 82,000 sales, its highest since
1989, when it was 86,000.''
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, the nation's home-ownership rate set a record
in 1998, with 66.3 percent of all households owning their own
homes, the Census Bureau reported.
</P>
<P>
   New York state set a record for existing-home sales, according
to the New York State Association of Realtors, with the 86,661
transactions surpassing by 14.3 percent the high of 75,796 sales in
1996. ``It was a tremendous year for New York's real estate
market,'' said Charles Staro, executive vice president of the state
realtors association, ``evidenced by the fact that 37 of our 40
local boards posted sales gains.''
</P>
<P>
   In Westchester County, to cite one dramatic example, sales last
year jumped 50.1 percent, spurring _ in the opinion of one
real-estate executive in neighboring Rockland County _ a 94.8
percent vault in Rockland's sales as house-hungry buyers widened
their sights.
</P>
<P>
   Those were extremes, to be sure. But sales-volume increases in
neighboring states last year were certainly healthy: 13.4 percent
in New Jersey and 13.9 percent in Connecticut. For the 10 counties
of northern New Jersey closest to New York, the increase was 7.2
percent; for Fairfield County, Conn., it was 10.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   And as demand goes, so goes price. Throughout the three-state
metropolitan region, according to the National Association of
Realtors, median prices rose 5.7 percent, from $177,900 in 1997 to
$188,100 last year. Around New York City's suburban arc, price
increases ranged from 3.4 percent for northern New Jersey ($199,300
in 1997 and $206,100 last year) to 24 percent in Westchester
County, N.Y., ($293,400 in 1997 and $363,900 last year).
</P>
<P>
   Tracking real-estate trends by the numbers defies absolute
precision. Although single-family house sales are reported by local
realty boards, not all real estate agents are members of the boards
and not all sales are made through agents, so not all sales in a
given area are recorded.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, while one board may use median prices _
meaning half the sales are above that figure and half below _
others calculate an average. Still, the numbers serve as barometers
of market patterns, especially when they all point in the same
direction.
</P>
<P>
   Last year's trend, if that term suffices, is borne out by the
findings of the Case Shiller Weiss repeat-sale survey. Of the 577
ZIP-code areas in 14 suburban counties, according to the survey, as
well as in the 130 ZIP-code areas in the New York City boroughs of
Brooklyn, Queens, the Bronx and Staten Island (the survey does not
include Manhattan), every one experienced price appreciation. In
1997, by comparison, 56 ZIP-code areas saw prices drop, and the
year before that the number was 117.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fundamentals are as good as ever,'' Hughes of Rutgers
said.
</P>
<P>
   On March 1, the nation's economic expansion entered its 96th
month, or eighth year. In November, it surpassed the longest
peacetime expansion of 92 months, which occurred from 1982 to 1990.
The nation is now 10 months shy of matching the all-time record of
106 months, from 1961 to 1969.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over the past several years of this expansion,'' Hughes said,
``the new information-age economy has finally started generating a
lot of jobs, and labor shortages have appeared.''
</P>
<P>
   In February, said John Weiting, the regional commissioner of the
U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, the nation's unemployment rate
stood at 4.4 percent, matching its lowest levels in three decades.
</P>
<P>
   In the 31-county area that the bureau designates as the New York
region, 173,000 jobs were created in 1998, Weiting said, reaching
8.1 million. And while those jobs represented a ``bit of a cooling
off'' from the 203,000 jobs created in 1997, he said, ``the year
still came in as the second best for the decade'' _ and was part of
the region's continuing rebound from the moribund days of the early
'90s when information-age jobs were still aborning and the dreaded
economic watchword was downsizing.
</P>
<P>
   Further fueling the housing market, demographers point out, is
the fact that the peak year for the baby boom was 1957, when there
were 4.5 million births nationwide; so more baby boomers than ever
are now 42 years old. ``Never before have we had such a
concentration of individuals in their peak income-earning years,''
Hughes said.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty years ago, when the first boomers entered the market,
they were at the lower rungs of the house-buying ladder. ``Today,
their house-purchasing power is immense,'' Hughes said, ``so the
trade-up market is the foundation for the demand.''
</P>
<P>
   The demand has been propelled by low mortgage rates.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly the big story in the last 12 months,'' said Keith
Gumbinger, vice president of HSH Associates, a mortgage statistics
company in Butler, N.J., ``is that mortgage rates touched 31-year
lows and climbed back only to 20-odd-year lows.'' Mortgage rates
dropped to 6.68 percent during the week ending Oct. 2 _ a low last
hit in 1967. On Wednesday, the rate stood at 7.03 percent.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   As Gumbinger said: ``The underlying story has been the
unrelenting stability of interest rates. I mean, really, we have
seen, almost no significant change, aside from that 31-year low.''
The range of mortgage rates in 1998, including the 31-year low, has
been .6 percent. ``That's the most stable year since 1977,''
Gumbinger said.
</P>
<P>
   So the buyers came, and spent.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout northern New Jersey, according to the New Jersey
Association of Realtors, sales rose 7.2 percent, from 63,100 in
1997 to 67,700 in 1998. The median price rose 3.4 percent, from
$199,300 to $206,000.
</P>
<P>
   By way of example, in Bergen and Passaic counties, the median
price rose from $205,400 to $213,500, or 4 percent. Middlesex,
Somerset and Hunterdon, taken together, experienced a 4.2 percent
increase, $176,700 to $184,200.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's spurring it,'' said Patrick O'Keefe, executive vice
president of the New Jersey Builders Association, ``is New Jersey's
housing deficit.'' O'Keefe said that although New Jersey's
population continues to grow, housing construction is down 40
percent from its 1980s rate.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is also,'' O'Keefe said, ``a considerable wealth effect
in northern New Jersey, particularly on the Gold Coast,'' the
communities along the Hudson River, ``which benefits from the
dearth of construction in New York City. Therefore, even very
expensive units on the Jersey side of the Hudson are in demand.''
</P>
<P>
   The profile of northern New Jersey's buyers, O'Keefe said,
includes, particularly, empty-nesters and upwardly mobile young
people. ``At these prices they must be combining incomes,'' he
said, ``but I'm not sure of the marital arrangement; such
arrangements have changed since I was young.''
</P>
<P>
   As confirmed by the Case Shiller survey, both groups seem
willing to pay. The survey is based on a table showing the average
price for all single-family homes sold in most ZIP-code areas, year
by year (some areas are omitted because of insufficient data).
</P>
<P>
   To determine price fluctuations in 1998, for example, the survey
took the purchase price of each home sold in each ZIP-code area
during the year just ended, compared it to the price the house
brought the last time it sold, and then, using the annual index,
adjusted the earlier purchase price to what it likely would have
been had it sold in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The 1998 sales prices for homes within each ZIP-code area were
then compared with the estimated 1997 prices to compute the average
change.
</P>
<P>
   For the 318 ZIP-code areas in the 10-county northern New Jersey
region, 58 saw prices rise by up to 4 percent, 100 by 4 percent to
6 percent, 107 by 6 percent to 8 percent, 46 by 8 percent to 10
percent, six by 10 percent to 12 percent and one (in the Monmouth
County community of Rumson) by more than 12 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Wedged between northern New Jersey and Westchester,
triangle-shaped Rockland County stepped out of the shadows last
year. Sales zoomed, the state association of Realtors reported,
with 2,267 transactions last year representing a whopping 94.8
percent increase over the 1,164 deals in 1997. The median price
also jumped, from $203,400 to $235,350, or 15.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rockland has been a secret for a lot of years,'' said Karen
Glazer, past president of the county board of realtors and co-owner
of Glazer Realty in Spring Valley, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   The Case Shiller survey does not cover Rockland, because of
insufficient data, but Ms. Glazer provided broad price estimates.
``One-bedroom condos all over start about $100,000,'' she said.
``Town houses, one- to three-bedrooms, start about $225,000. For
the fancier ones in Suffern, Nanuet, top price would be about
$300,000.'' A high ranch around the county, she said, ``is going
for $250,000, but there's new construction going for $500,000 to
$750,000.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the soaring sales volume, Ms. Glazer said: ``You
know what it is? Because prices have skyrocketed in Westchester,
people have gone farther north, over a bridge _ the Tappan Zee or
the George Washington _ to discover reasonably priced homes.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, Westchester has not suffered.
</P>
<P>
   Officials of the Westchester County Board of Realtors did not
respond to several requests for comment, but according to the state
Realtors association, sales in the county jumped 50.1 percent, from
5,750 in 1997 to 8,628 last year. And the median price rose 24
percent, from $293,400 to $363,900.
</P>
<P>
   The Case Shiller survey showed that of Westchester's 65 ZIP-code
areas, six saw prices rise 4 percent to 6 percent, 20 by 6 percent
to 8 percent, 17 by 8 percent to 10 percent, seven by 10 percent to
12 percent and in 15 _ or almost one-quarter of the total _ by at
least 12 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In Westchester's neighbor to the east, Fairfield County,
according to the Case Shiller survey, nine of the 45 ZIP-code areas
saw prices rise by 4 percent to 6 percent, 16 from 6 percent to 8
percent, eight between 8 percent and 10 percent, 11 by 10 percent
to 12 percent and one (in Norwalk) by at least 12 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Vincent Valvo, editor of The Commercial Record, a business
weekly that covers the state, said that in addition to ``enjoying
the economic beneficence of New York City,'' most of Fairfield was
building on ``the continued development of Stamford and suburban
areas like Shelton.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Commercial Record statistics, sales in Fairfield
County increased from 17,743 in 1997 to 19,598 in 1998, or 10.5
percent. The median price rose 3.9 percent, from $203,500 to
$211,500.
</P>
<P>
   Within Fairfield County, even long-struggling Bridgeport saw
sales increase 14.2 percent, from 1,769 to 2,021, while the median
price rose 12.1 percent, from $74,500 to $83,550. In New Canaan,
where the 460 sales recorded last year represented a 3.1 percent
increase over the 446 sales in 1997, the median price jumped 10.9
percent, from $505,000 to $560,000 last year.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   There were good times on Long Island, N.Y., too, said Joseph
Mottola, executive officer of the Long Island Board of Realtors,
``because of a confluence of things _ interest rates, mortgage
products to fit unique needs, low unemployment.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't hear about downsizing any more,'' Mottola said.
``You hear about companies unable to fill jobs.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the Multiple Listing Service of Long Island, there
were 8,199 sales in Nassau last year, 4.6 percent more than the
7,835 in 1997. The median price jumped 10.2 percent, from $209,466
to $230,791.
</P>
<P>
   The Case Shiller survey showed that of the 63 ZIP-code areas in
Nassau, 19 saw prices rise 4 percent to 6 percent, 35 by 6 percent
to 8 percent and nine by between 8 percent and 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Asked to offer a range of median prices across Nassau, Mottola
checked his records and said: ``At the less expensive end, we have
Levittown: '97 is $146,000 and '98 is $158,000; Baldwin went from
$167,000 to $170,000, Glen Cove, $250,000 to $254,000.''
</P>
<P>
   In Suffolk, sales rose 7.4 percent last year to 11,244 from
10,470 in 1997, while the median price was up 7.5 percent, from
$164,662 to $176,957. And according to Case Shiller Weiss, of
Suffolk's 86 ZIP-code areas, one appreciated by up to 4 percent; 24
by 4 percent to 6 percent, 37 by 6 percent to 8 percent, 23 by
between 8 percent and 10 percent, and one (Wading River) by 10
percent to 12 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Choosing three communities as examples in Suffolk, Mottola said:
``For Brentwood, the '97 median was $106,700 and '98 was $112,000.
Northport, '97 was $262,500 and '98 is $281,000. And in Cold Spring
Harbor, '97 was $470,000 and '98 was $522,500.''
</P>
<P>
   Barely five months ago, in October, prospects for a booming
residential market seemed, at best, imperiled. The so-called Asian
economic contagion had begun to infect South America. The Russian
economy virtually collapsed. The stock market swooned. And home
buyers, particularly high-enders hooked to quarterly reports,
headed for the bunkers.
</P>
<P>
   But in some ways the turmoil bolstered the housing market. A
world oil glut kept fuel prices and, consequently, inflation down.
The flight of capital to the United States kept interest rates
down; on top of which the Federal Reserve Board, in three quick
hits, further lowered interest rates and, consequently, mortgage
rates. The stock market roared back. And all of that meshed with
the propitious demographics of house buying.
</P>
<P>
   But is it sustainable?
</P>
<P>
   With a Realtor's institutional optimism, Flick, the economist
for the National Association of Realtors, believes that even after
the baby boomers settle into their trade-up homes and the so-called
baby bust begins to siphon off demand, immigrants will plug the
gap. ``Immigrants are coming in at roughly 1 million a year, and
analysts have found that after six years' residency about 70
percent become homeowners,'' Flick said.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in about a decade, he said, the millennium generation _
those people currently 18 or 19 years old _ will enter the market.
``The boomers were wealthy and fruitful and multiplied,'' Flick
said. ``There are about 80 million boomers and about 70 million
millennium kids. So, like that Stephen King novel, `Children of the
Corn,' they will come with their scythes and harvest the housing
market of the next, say, two decades.''
</P>
<P>
   All of that assumes, said Hughes of Rutgers, ``that the economic
stars will stay in alignment.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We could have a real global economic meltdown that ultimately
feeds back to the United States,'' he said. But at least for now
the nation's housing fundamentals remain firm. ``The nation and the
region have none of the imbalances that caused the great
real-estate bubble of the 1980s,'' Hughes said. ``Today's builders
are the survivors of the debacle. They are more conservative, so
overbuilding and speculative development are nonexistent today.''
</P>
<P>
   Rae Rosen, a senior regional economist for the Federal Reserve
Bank of New York, is, well, reserved. ``Certainly, for the region,
we've probably hit the cyclical peak in terms of job growth, income
growth and housing activity,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Rosen wonders if the boom can last: ``It will be difficult
to sustain the '98 growth rate in '99. It will still be good, it
just won't be great.''
</P>
<P>
   For Hughes, the nation's economy and housing performance in 1998
constituted a ``go-figure'' market. ``We were an oasis of
prosperity in a turbulent economic world _ go figure.''

 TEACHER'S SEXUAL ABUSE TRIAL FORCES PARENTS AND STUDENTS TO CHOOSE
SIDES
</HEADLINE>
   (jw) 
 By IVER PETERSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   FLORHAM PARK, N.J. _ Until police came, the worst thing anyone
at Briarwood Elementary School said about David Ford was that he
should, perhaps, push his third- and fourth-grade math students a
little harder and cut back on the birthday parties. Other teachers
hold one party for several children, but Ford brought in cupcakes
for each birthday boy and girl, and eventually Jack Wootton, the
principal, had to speak to him about it.
</P>
<P>
   But now Ford is in the last week of a criminal trial where
prosecutors are saying the worst possible things about him.
</P>
<P>
   They accuse him of groping and rubbing 12 little girls as they
stood at his desk in front of the class, sometimes while other
students were waiting in line with their problems. It is, his
lawyer acknowledged, as ugly a charge as you can make about a
teacher.
</P>
<P>
   ``Worse than murder,'' said the lawyer, Alan Zegas, who in his
opening statement cited Arthur Miller's witch-hunt play, ``The
Crucible'' _ in which little girls are false accusers _ and
McCarthyism. ``The worst label is not witch or Communist,'' he
said. ``The worst thing is to be called a sexual predator, and even
worse than that is to be accused of sexually abusing children.''
</P>
<P>
   Given the monstrousness of the charges, it is surprising that so
many people still believe in Ford's innocence.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Ford's defense team brought in parents and students
and teachers who stuck with Ford _ youngsters who remember Ford
only as a friendly teacher who might give them a pat on the back or
on top of the head and who said they never saw what the accusers
claim. And there were parents and teachers who do not believe the
charges.
</P>
<P>
   ``I worked with Dave too long to believe all this,'' said
Margaret Skar, a fifth-grade teacher at the Briarwood School. ``My
opinion is based on his professional background.''
</P>
<P>
   Eva Steinway told the court how Ford, a 59-year-old grandfather,
had helped her son adjust to his move from Jersey City. And when he
took the stand, her son said he had not seen any of the things some
of Ford's accusers said they saw. All the children's names are
shielded by the court.
</P>
<P>
   Ford has rejected several plea deals, even though it has meant a
trial that has ruined him financially.
</P>
<P>
   Debbi Kyprianou, a former PTA president who was the class mother
in Ford's homeroom and often made unannounced visits to his class,
testified that she believed in Ford's innocence. ``I'm very
intuitive,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   In a key part of Ford's defense, Mrs. Kyprianou said that a
telephone chain to parents about ``an incident involving a
teacher'' created chaos among Florham Park parents and students
before the 12 accusers had even been interviewed by investigators.
</P>
<P>
   That chaos _ hysteria, Zegas called it _ tainted the girls'
stories, the lawyer maintains. And Ford's case may have received a
boost when one girl, a friend of some of the accusers, wrote to
prosecutors saying she had helped them make up the charges. But the
girl then recanted, saying she only wrote the letter to avoid
testifying.
</P>
<P>
   So what do the prosecutors make of the way so many people are
sticking with Ford? It turns out it's not all that unusual.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know it's the defendant who's actually on trial, but it is
really the victims who feel the brunt of society's reaction,'' said
Leslie Wade, one of the Morris County prosecutors on the case. ``We
once had a teacher who pleaded guilty to sexual abuse of a girl and
we had kids writing editorials in the school newspaper claiming he
was innocent even after he admitted he was guilty.''
</P>
<P>
   The charges against Ford made other Briarwood teachers newly
conscious of how they dealt with their students, and some asked the
principal, Wootton, what they should do, say, if a child hugged
them.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're like puppies,'' said Roberta Rountree, one of the
teachers who testified for Ford. ``They want to be held, they want
to hold your hand, and now all of us are so conscious of how
anything we do might be interpreted.'' Now, teachers never allow
themselves to be alone in a classroom with a student, Mrs. Rountree
said.
</P>
<P>
   So with all this concern, what did Wootton say to teachers who
didn't know to react to third graders' hugs?
</P>
<P>
   ``I told them to hug right back,'' he said.

NEW JERSEY FINDS NO SIMPLE SOLUTIONS IN SCHOOL TAKEOVERS
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.J., Mich., N.Y., Ill.)   (See related story: NJ-TAKEOVER-WEST) 
(jw) 
 By MARIA NEWMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWARK, N.J. _ Ten years ago, New Jersey officials decided they
were tired of watching from the sideline as Jersey City school and
city officials seemed more concerned with providing jobs for
friends than with falling student test scores. So state officials
took charge of the system, kicking out the superintendent and
school board members.
</P>
<P>
   A decade into state control, attendance is up slightly in Jersey
City schools and test scores have improved, but there has been no
drastic turnaround in student performance. And the state is seen by
many residents as little more than an occupying force.
</P>
<P>
   The Department of Education is now running the state's three
largest school districts, yet state officials are still without a
plan to return the schools to local control, a detail that was not
addressed in the legislation that gave the state authority to take
over schools. And even those New Jersey officials involved with the
original takeover in 1989 now acknowledge that the state was armed
with more good intentions than practical strategy.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a vague assumption on our part that if we fixed the
central office, and replaced the people who were there with good
people, those good people would solve the problems of urban
education,'' said Leo Klagholz, New Jersey's commissioner of
education, who was the head of teacher certification for the state
in 1989. ``It turns out to be not that simple.''
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey was the first state to take over a school system
after deciding that it was inept and corrupt. Twenty-one other
states have followed suit, but having seen New Jersey's model at
work, they are shying away from taking control of all day-to-day
operations. Instead, those states favor takeovers that give local
mayors control of the school systems.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, for example, Michigan moved to require
Detroit's mayor to take over that school system. But while other
states have traveled a different road, New Jersey officials still
defend their all-or-nothing approach.
</P>
<P>
   The state's record on its three takeovers _ Jersey City, Newark
(in 1995) and Paterson (in 1991) _ was debated again last month
after Beverly Hall, the state-appointed head of Newark's schools,
announced she would leave to head Atlanta's schools.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Hall, Newark's only superintendent since the state takeover
in 1995, had faced tremendous resistance from the teachers union,
local residents and elected officials. And four years later,
critics say the district's academic achievement has not met the
state's own benchmarks.
</P>
<P>
   Yet there have been improvements. In 1993, before the state took
over, only about a quarter of Newark's 11th graders passed the
statewide High School Proficiency Test. Last year, 50 percent
passed the math portion of the test, 61.9 percent passed the
writing portion and 63.3 percent passed the reading portion, though
the results fell short of the state's own target of 85 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Ms. Hall said she did not believe a takeover
was the best way to fix a troubled school system, because local
residents and officials did not feel they had much opportunity to
affect decisions and therefore might not support changes.
</P>
<P>
   ``But when children's lives are at stake _ and I think education
is that important _ when they are failing so drastically, then
drastic actions are required,'' she said. ``You have almost an
obligation to take them over.''
</P>
<P>
   But some dispute whether a state must run the district itself to
see results. Michael Casserly, executive director of the Council of
the Great City Schools in Washington, a coalition of the country's
54 largest districts, said other states had learned that wresting
power from local officials was not the best way to make academic
gains.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most states have resisted using that tool,'' he said. ``They
don't know what to do. Who in Albany knows what to do in New York
City? If they knew what to do, I assume they would have told us by
now.''
</P>
<P>
   Casserly said that other states had left control in the hands of
local officials, usually the mayor. Supporters of this model point
to Chicago, where the mayor was given control of the schools by the
state Legislature in 1995. Test scores there improved enough to be
cited by President Clinton in his State of the Union speech in
January.
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey can certainly claim victory in some areas. Political
corruption and mismanagement in the takeover districts have been
eradicated by most accounts, and neglected buildings have been
spruced up.
</P>
<P>
   But takeovers are not popular. Resentment over the
state-appointed head of Jersey City's schools contributed to a
bitter five-day teachers strike there last fall. And in Newark last
month, Mayor Sharpe James had stinging words for Ms. Hall, accusing
her of being a carpetbagger and alienating local residents.
</P>
<P>
   And New Jersey's takeovers have not resulted in quick, drastic
academic gains. In Jersey City, for example, the overall attendance
rate was 89.1 percent in 1989, when the state took control; last
year it was 91.4 percent. Although standardized tests have changed
since the takeover, in 1993-94, the first year the High School
Proficiency Test was given, 66.4 percent of 11th graders passed the
math portion; last year, 69.8 percent passed.
</P>
<P>
   ``State takeover in New Jersey is like Vietnam,'' said Gregg
Butterfield, the president of Jersey City's Board of Education,
which is now locally elected but with restricted powers. ``The
state doesn't know how to get out.''
</P>

</P>
<P>
   In New York, state officials took over one district, Roosevelt
on Long Island in 1996, but then changed their strategy, said
Richard Mills, the state's commissioner of education. Instead of
complete takeovers, the state now places troubled schools on a list
of ``Schools Under Registration Review,'' and tells them they must
show improvement in three years or risk being shut down. But it
leaves the decision-making in the hands of local officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``We try to accomplish reform through a combination of pressure
and support,'' Mills said. ``It seems to us there's great strength
and leadership in some of these cities, and you need to back these
leaders.''
</P>
<P>
   New York officials have shown they mean business. Six schools
have been shut down in four years, while 63 have come off the list
because they showed improvement. About 100 schools new are on the
list, Mills said, most of them in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   To see what worked, the Educational Priorities Panel, a
state--appointed group, studied 10 failing schools in New York that
had shown significant improvement. In all cases, they said, the
schools had strong principals and staffs whose first mission was to
improve student achievement.
</P>
<P>
   What the report did not find was a link between the school's
physical condition and the student performance. Complaints about
crowded classrooms and graffiti on school walls were legitimate
topics for debate, the panel found, but missed the real point of
what made schools work.
</P>
<P>
   ``Buildings should be in a state of good repair simply because
children deserve a decent learning environment,'' the report
stated. ``Yet the repair of a leaking roof or the plumbing will not
lead to the mastery of mathematics.''
</P>
<P>
   But in New Jersey, officials say that the poor state of repairs
was one indication that an entire school system was not working.
Jack Ewing, a former New Jersey state senator who sponsored the
takeover legislation, said that at one school in Jersey City,
maintenance money was so mismanaged that students had to climb four
flights of stairs to go to the bathroom.
</P>
<P>
   And Jersey City Mayor Bret Schundler, no fan of the takeover,
said that corruption was never all that widespread to begin with.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some purchasing agents went to jail for selling electronic
equipment the district was buying,'' said the mayor, who was not in
office when the state came in. ``That is absolutely outrageous that
they were doing that. But how much was being stolen? Maybe tens of
thousands of dollars. The district's budget is about $80 million.
That's not why half the kids were not making it to the 12th
grade.''
</P>
<P>
   There is widespread agreement now, even among state officials,
that by focusing on mismanagement and maintenance, the state may
not have spent enough energy at first on classroom performance.
</P>
<P>
   Arthur Levine, the president of Teachers College at Columbia
University, said, ``Unless you radically improve scores _ and it
doesn't sound like they have in Jersey City _ then the new owners
haven't done better than the old owners.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: `It's not who's running the schools that's important.
What's more important is what are they doing once they take them
over.''
</P>
<P>
   In Paterson, N.J., the state took control in 1991 because the
district administration was deemed inept rather than corrupt. Mayor
Martin Barnes, who was then the City Council president, said that
was a mistake.
</P>
<P>
   ``The state came in and said we're going to take over, and
anyone with any interest in making education better here was
sloughed to one side, and it was crazy,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He said that for the first few years of the takeover, the state
pumped millions of dollars into the district, yet test scores
actually went down. Results began to improve only after the state
appointed Edwin Duroy as superintendent. Duroy had improved things
in Hoboken in seven years as head of that district, and Barnes said
he and other city officials brought him to the state's attention
and lobbied for his selection.
</P>
<P>
   Those who have studied New Jersey's urban school districts say
that it takes time to turn a system around. Jean Anyon, chairwoman
of the education department at Rutgers University in Newark, said
that in four years, test scores in Newark had ``gone from very low
to low.'' She said Ms. Hall faced a huge task in turning around a
sprawling district of 82 schools where administrators indulged in
expensive restaurant meals while school buildings crumbled.
</P>
<P>
   Anyon said that shortly after Ms. Hall came in, she reduced the
administrative staff by 600. She replaced principals in about half
the schools and set specific academic goals.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dr. Hall was very, very brave and did things that were
absolutely necessary that angered many people,'' Anyon said.
</P>
<P>
   Before any of New Jersey's takeover districts can be returned to
local control, they must meet certain benchmarks: At least 75
percent of fourth and eighth graders must pass the state test in
reading, writing and math, and 85 percent of 11th graders must pass
the High School Proficiency Test in the same three subjects.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the test scores are not the state's only concern. New Jersey
officials are unsure how to return the school districts to local
control in a way that will keep the system from falling back into
corruption and mismanagement.
</P>
<P>
   In Jersey City, for example, Franklin Williams, who was
superintendent at the time of the takeover, has won a place on the
school board. He has indicated his desire to continue running the
district when it is returned to local control. But state officials
worry, because they say he was involved with the previous political
system that provided school jobs to friends of elected officials.
</P>
<P>
   The state Board of Education will consider removing Jersey City
and its 32,000 students from the takeover list in the fall. Richard
DiPatri, Jersey City's state-appointed superintendent, said: ``Is
the system ready to go back to local control today? The answer is
absolutely yes.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet state Sen. Robert Martin, chairman of the joint committee on
public education, said legislators did not have a concrete plan
about how to return any of the districts to local control and were
still discussing it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was in the Assembly when we took over Jersey City,'' he
said. ``There was some positive sense that a takeover would really
inspire local officials to work very hard at righting the ship. I
think you can definitely point to improved administrations. Beyond
that, the jury is still out on how much good this did. It gets to
the core of what the purpose of a takeover is.''

POLICE SHOOT 2 TEENS IN STOLEN CAR IN BROOKLYN
</HEADLINE>
   (jw) 
 By KIT R. ROANE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Police officers investigating a car theft in Brooklyn
on Saturday morning shot and wounded two teen-age suspects when
they tried to run over the officers, police said.
</P>
<P>
   The 15-year-old boys, whose names were not released because of
their ages, were taken to the Brookdale Hospital Medical Center,
where they remained in stable condition, the police said. One was
shot in the neck, and the other in the right cheek, the police
said. No weapons were recovered from the suspects, they said.
</P>
<P>
   A third suspect, Adrian Edwards, 21, of Maple Street in
Brooklyn, was apprehended as he tried to flee the parking lot at
the Starrett City housing projects in East New York shortly before
officers opened fire. Only two of the six officers at the scene
fired their service pistols, discharging a total of four rounds,
police said. No charges have been filed against them.
</P>
<P>
   Sgt. Nick Vreeland, a Police Department spokesman, said the
incident began shortly before 6:30 a.m., when officers in a patrol
car spotted the three driving down Pennsylvania Avenue near
Flatlands Avenue in a white Acura that had been reported stolen. He
said the officers decided to follow the car, calling in
reinforcements after the suspects spotted them and tried to speed
away.
</P>
<P>
   The police said the chase, which included three patrol cars,
ended when the suspects rammed into several cars inside the parking
lot at Seaview and Van Siclen avenues. As Edwards ran from the car,
the two 15-year-olds got into a dark green BMW 325i they had parked
in the lot. They drove toward the officers standing in the lot's
entrance, and the officers opened fire, stopping them, police said.
All six officers were later taken to Jamaica Hospital in Queens for
treatment of minor injuries and trauma, police said.
</P>
<P>
   According to department guidelines, an officer is not supposed
to shoot at a moving vehicle unless deadly force other than the
vehicle _ such as a gun _ is being used against him. Although no
weapons were found on the suspects, Vreeland added that these
guidelines are not the same as rules, and that when investigating a
shooting, the Police Department must ``look at the totality of the
facts involved in the specific incident.'' Forensics investigators
were scouring the lot for evidence Saturday morning.
</P>
<P>
   Coming at a time of intense criticism over the police shooting
of Amadou Diallo, the shootings drew an immediate skeptical
response from the Rev. Al Sharpton, a frequent critic of the
department, who said family members of the suspects, as well as
some witnesses, had called him to urge an investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not want to prejudge this, but I do not understand the
necessity of shootings here,'' Sharpton said. ``This is not the
time when we are willing to take a lot of things the police say at
face value.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Residents in Starrett City, a complex of housing projects just
off the Fresh Creek Basin, said that the lot had long been a
dumping ground for stolen cars.
</P>
<P>
   ``I heard a lot of shooting, about six shots, and it woke me
up,'' said Elsie Contes, 32. ``When I went to my terrace, there
were two bodies next to a car, and it didn't look like they were
moving. Then I heard screaming, someone yelling `yo, yo' and there
was a lot of commotion.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Ford, a 41-year-old postal worker, said he came home
shortly after the shootings to see his sister's car among those
smashed in the final chase. ``I was glad I was at work, or it could
have been my car,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ford and other residents, all of whom pay a fee to park in the
lot, said they hoped the incident would force their landlords to
increase security there, possibly installing locked barriers at the
entrances.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem is people leave stolen cars here because it is
close to the Belt Parkway, but nobody really checks on it,'' said
Louis Perez, 43. ``The only difference this time is they got
shot.''

A NEW THREAT IN COLLECTING CHILD SUPPORT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Conn., Fla., Colo., N.Y.)  (jw) 
 By RAYMOND HERNANDEZ   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Even the staunchest critics of Gov. George
Pataki's welfare policies have praised his campaign to collect
child support from delinquent parents, most of them men, so their
families do not wind up on public assistance.
</P>
<P>
   But those same people now say Pataki may be taking that campaign
too far with a proposal to deny all welfare benefits to single
parents, mostly women, when they refuse to help the state identify
and collect child support payments from delinquent parents.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty other states have a similar policy, and the Pataki
administration contends that the penalty will give the state a
powerful tool for pursuing child support payments on behalf of
single parents who, for whatever reason, have been unwilling to do
so themselves. The administration says it will provide exemptions
in certain cases, such as when a woman can prove she has been the
victim of domestic abuse.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not intended to be punitive,'' said Robert Doar,
director of the New York State Office of Child Support Enforcement.
``We are trying to encourage compliance with child support.'' He
added: ``It is in the long-term best interest of single mothers and
their children.''
</P>
<P>
   But some advocates for the poor contend that Pataki's proposal
is misguided, noting that in many instances women do not pursue
child-support payments from a former boyfriend or husband for fear
of retaliation. To deny welfare benefits in such cases, they argue,
would ultimately hurt children.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we should be beating up on little kids just
because of the actions of their parents,'' said Karen Schimke,
executive director of the State Communities Aid Association, a
coalition of welfare advocacy groups that has long supported the
governor's child-support collection policies. ``We have stood with
the governor on many other things, but we think he is wrong in this
one area.''
</P>
<P>
   The proposal is intended to bolster the Pataki administration's
broad campaign to crack down on noncustodial parents who fail to
meet financial obligations to their children.
</P>
<P>
   The state's child-support collection efforts have been waged on
many fronts since Pataki took office in 1995. The state has
suspended the driver's licenses of delinquent parents, placed liens
on their property, located them through state labor records,
enacted new penalties for delinquency and required more women to
help caseworkers establish paternity.
</P>
<P>
   In all, the crackdown has raised child support payments in New
York to $872 million last year, from $574 million in 1994. The
additional payments have helped the state move 155,000 women and
children off the state's welfare rolls in that period. The payments
have also increased the household incomes of well over 127,000
women and children, many of whom may have wound up on welfare
without the added income, according to state officials and
advocates for the poor.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Pataki's aggressive campaign to collect child support is
considered particularly important for people on welfare because
they now face strict limits on how long they can receive cash
assistance from the state and federal government. But his latest
proposal has stirred such widespread concern that it will likely
face stiff opposition in the state Legislature.
</P>
<P>
   Connecticut, Florida and Colorado are among the roughly 30
states that already cut off welfare benefits entirely when, for
example, a mother refuses to help the authorities track down and
collect child support from a delinquent father. Now, New York only
reduces monthly grants by 25 percent in such cases. Those grants
run about $500 for a family of three.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of the governor's latest proposal contend that in many
instances women opt to lose 25 percent of their monthly grant
rather than help the state identify former husbands and boyfriends
who might retaliate against them. The critics say that eliminating
the entire grant would impose needless hardships on such families.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that, the critics contends that the new penalty could be
abused by cash-strapped localities seeking ways to trim their
welfare rolls.
</P>
<P>
   But the administration points out that the current penalty has
been used sparingly since it was adopted a year ago: Of the 312,000
single parents on the welfare rolls, only about 3,000 have been
penalized for failing to help social service officials track down
delinquent parents. The administration also says it has waived the
penalty in 600 cases involving women who have refused to cooperate
on the ground that they are victims of domestic abuse and fear
further attacks.
</P>
<P>
   To comply, the custodial parent must give the full name of the
delinquent parent, as well as other personal information about that
parent, such as a Social Security number, an employer or home
address.
</P>
<P>
   Doar, the head of the state's child-support enforcement office,
said the administration suspected that many of the single mothers
who had been penalized were probably already receiving money,
albeit surreptitiously, from their former boyfriends or husbands.
Rather than declare that money to the state and risk being taken
off the rolls, many simply choose to absorb a partial cut in their
grant, according to the state.
</P>
<P>
   Doar maintained that the full sanction would help the state
ferret out such fraud.

UPTOWN BLOCK OPTS OUT OF INTENSIVE POLICE PROGRAM
</HEADLINE>
   (jw) 
 By KIT R. ROANE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ By many accounts, the New York City Police
Department's model block program has been a resounding success,
with officers and residents in nearly two dozen areas where it has
been applied noticing a sharp drop in crime.
</P>
<P>
   But when those living in a crime-ridden area of Washington
Heights heard last week that their block might be the next one
saturated by officers and then barricaded against traffic, they
took to the streets in protest.
</P>
<P>
   The strong reaction on 159th Street, between Broadway and
Amsterdam Avenue, took police officials by surprise, particularly
since the crime-fighting technique was already being used
successfully on four other nearby blocks. But on Wednesday, Police
Commissioner Howard Safir agreed not to use the tactics anywhere
residents did not want it. The organizers of the Washington Heights
protest declared victory.
</P>
<P>
   The opposition stems in part from growing tension brought out by
the fatal police shooting of Amadou Diallo and the tactics used in
the program, which can last for months and often has officers
questioning people coming onto the block.
</P>
<P>
   The opposition also reflects how the struggling neighborhood has
sought to address its problems without outside help, beginning a
cleanup of their street that goes far beyond ridding it of crime.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we are trying to do is organize the community to tackle
all of the block's problems,'' said Carlos Rodriguez, a member of a
neighborhood group, the Community League of West 159th Street. ``We
are trying to be proactive and make real changes here, which means
this will take time. But it's better than criminalizing the entire
community, which is what happens when the police close off these
blocks.''
</P>
<P>
   To date, the department says, it has set up 21 model block
programs across the city, the first nearly two years ago at 163nd
Street between Broadway and Amsterdam. Though there has been some
grumbling on these blocks _ with neighbors' complaining that they
were harassed or merchants' saying business has been disrupted by
restraints on the flow of traffic _ the programs have drawn little
criticism.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   One concern, residents say, is that the police are too quick to
view residents with suspicion.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Diallo situation further enhanced what we already know,
that there is a great deal of police brutality, and it has just
made us more enraged,'' said Stephanie Colley, 20, who has lived on
the block for 15 years. ``Already, they come up to you if you're
standing on the block, and harass you, asking you what you are
doing or asking for ID. The model block will only make it worse. It
will make us prisoners in our own community.''
</P>
<P>
   There is also concern that crime is merely displaced to other
blocks, although the police say that much of the illegal activity
is eradicated by the program, because many drug dealers end up in
jail and their customers are discouraged from coming back.
</P>
<P>
   While applauding the efforts of the 159th Street residents,
Deputy Inspector Garry McCarthy, commander of the local precinct,
the 33rd, takes issue with the idea that the model block program
has the effect of turning residents into suspects. And he points to
the successes that have resulted from the plan on four other blocks
in his precinct.
</P>
<P>
   Since the program was started on West 163rd Street in June 1997,
violent crime there has dropped more than 96 percent, McCarthy
said. There have been only seven crimes reported on the block in
the last year and a half, and the most serious, a domestic assault,
was proved unfounded, he added.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fear of crime doesn't exist on 163rd Street now, and when
crime does occur they are of the type you would expect in suburbia,
not violent crime,'' he said, adding that residents protesting the
program on 159th Street have misunderstood what is occurring on
model blocks elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Some residents on 159th Street question whether the community
can clean itself up or force a drop in crime without more outside
help. These residents are not police boosters _ like their
neighbors, they complain of police harassment and worry over
well-publicized reports of brutality against members of minority
groups. But they like drug dealers even less.
</P>
<P>
   ``The cops are the lesser of two evils as far as I'm
concerned,'' said Laura McIver, 46, who grew up on the block and
returned in 1981 to buy a brownstone. Ms. McIver said the community
remains fractured, and was concerned that the latest organizing
push would not have much lasting impact.
</P>
<P>
   ``This place was crazy with drugs when I first left and it's
still got crime problems that would be helped by closing down the
block,'' she said. ``I want it back the way it was when I was a
kid.''

 SPORTS COLUMN: LaFONTAINE AND BEUKEBOOM HAVE CONCUSSIONS IN(rk) 
 By   JOE LAPOINTE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>

   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Backstage at Madison Square Garden last week, two
very different hockey players discussed their very similar injuries
and their unpleasant consequences. In a large banquet room stood
Pat LaFontaine, small for a professional athlete, eloquently
thanking guests who came to honor him for a brilliant career that
prematurely ended at age 33 because of multiple concussions.
</P>
<P>
   Two days later, in a smaller press room, sat Jeff Beukeboom, big
even for a hockey player, discussing the concussions that
prematurely ended his season and threaten his career at age 33.
</P>
<P>
   Even their names suggest their different styles. LaFontaine was
an elegant American-born forward, a fountain of goals and good
quotes. Beukeboom, a Canadian-born defenseman who rarely scores, is
what his onomatopoeic name suggests: a hard hitter who bangs bodies
into the boards, a taciturn man who lets his actions speak for
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   LaFontaine is 5-foot-10-inch, 180 pounds, Beukeboom is 6-5 and
230.
</P>
<P>
   ``There aren't too many similarities between me and Patty other
than the concussions,'' Beukeboom said, a tight smile on his face.
``The knowledge and the circumstances that surrounded Patty really
helps my situation. Learning from his process has made this easier
for me. I know what to expect.
</P>
<P>
   ``Talking to him puts things in perspective,'' Beukeboom added,
``and I know where we're at and basically what direction we're
heading in. At this point, it would be tough for me to say `Look,
I'm looking at this as a total positive thing where I'm going to
eventually get better and play next year.'''
</P>
<P>
   Beukeboom said he has had at least four or five major
concussions and quite a few small ones. LaFontaine retired late
last season after his sixth major concussion. His was one of an
epidemic of head injuries that included serious ones to stars like
Paul Kariya and Eric Lindros.
</P>
<P>
   This season, the league contends that the number of concussions
has been reduced, although the figures are not known. But lower
statistics don't heal the bruised brains of Rangers like LaFontaine
and Beukeboom. Despite improvements in headgear and mouth guards,
the physics and style of the sport suggest a growing danger.
</P>
<P>
   The modern players are bigger, faster and stronger. The size of
the rink is the same. The new style of glass in new arenas is
harder and firmer, so sturdy that players complain that hitting it
is like bumping into a brick wall. They dislike the glass the way
pro football players dislike artificial turf.
</P>
<P>
   But Beukeboom and LaFontaine suffered their injuries in open
ice, not along the walls. LaFontaine's last concussion had an
unusual twist. While watching the puck, he accidentally collided
with Mike Keane, a Ranger teammate. Beukeboom's biggest concussion
in November was more traditional and troubling. It came when he was
sucker-punched from behind by Matt Johnson, a ruffian with the Los
Angeles Kings.
</P>
<P>
   Beukeboom said it bothers him that Johnson has not apologized.
The day after it happened, Johnson said it was payback for past
deeds done by Beukeboom to Kings players, some of which were
dangerous and caused injuries. All this is so much a part of
hockey's passionate culture.
</P>
<P>
   While these elite athletes may make millions of dollars, theirs
is a visceral and emotional sport that many would play for nothing.
Sometimes, it is a gut-level grudge game where men lose eyes for
eyes and teeth for teeth.
</P>
<P>
   LaFontaine, who spent only one of his 15 seasons as a Ranger,
recalled his first major concussion, suffered nine years ago at the
Garden, when he was on the Islanders. It came during a playoff
series, one of those Islander-Ranger wars that got meaner by the
minute.
</P>
<P>
   A Rangers defenseman _ not Beukeboom _ flattened LaFontaine and
the fans cheered as LaFontaine lay unconscious on the ice. After he
was carried off on a stretcher and put in an ambulance, the vehicle
was attacked by hooligan Ranger fans, who rocked it and pounded on
the metal sides.
</P>
<P>
   In his speech last week, LaFontaine smiled slightly when he
recalled that night. He told a little joke about how a testimonial
dinner is like a funeral because people say good things about you.
(``If you could hear them talk at your funeral, what would you most
like to hear? Hey, he's still moving!'')
</P>
<P>
   LaFontaine turned a bit wistful, mentioning that he requested
that the song ``Garden Party'' be played during a post-banquet
gathering.
</P>
<P>
   The song, recorded by Rick Nelson during a comeback attempt in
1972, is about performing at Madison Square Garden. ``A chance to
share old memories,'' the lyrics begin, optimistically. ``There was
magic in the air ... .''
</P>
<P>
   But the story turns poignant. The show doesn't go over well.
There is no happy ending. ``You can't please everyone, so you got
to please yourself,'' Nelson sang, realizing, ``It was time to
leave.''
</P>

FIRING OF SCHOOL OFFICIAL STARTS POLITICAL FIGHT 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By SUSAN SACHS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The dismissal of a school superintendent in Queens
for her handling of a school gun incident has set the stage for a
fresh legal and political fight over the power of the New York City
schools chancellor, Rudy Crew, to impose his will on elected
community school boards, school and community officials said
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute revolves around Celestine Miller, whom Crew fired
from her job as superintendent of District 29 on Thursday. The next
day, the district board directly challenged the chancellor by
voting to reinstate Ms. Miller.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter sent to Crew after their vote, the board members
said they were acting according to the ``rights and duties granted
to us by the voters of southeast Queens.''
</P>
<P>
   The board hired Ms. Miller in early 1997, and so it has the
power to decide her fate, Leroy Comrie Jr., the District 29 board
president, maintained in a telephone interview Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe that there's a legality in there that requires him
to have consulted us and given us the right of final determination
as to her termination,'' Comrie said.
</P>
<P>
   But the chancellor has rejected that view, based on the powers
to hire and fire district superintendents that were granted him by
a state law that took effect a few weeks after Ms. Miller's
selection in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``We firmly believe he has the right to dismiss any
superintendent, regardless of whom the contract was with,'' said
Chiara Coletti, the chancellor's spokeswoman. She added that Crew
``will do everything in his power under the law to sustain Mrs.
Miller's removal.''
</P>
<P>
   Comrie said the district board would pursue its challenge to the
chancellor administratively, by appealing to the central Board of
Education and, if necessary, to the courts. It has appointed an
emergency interim superintendent, Brenda McClellan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where we go from here, who knows?'' Comrie said. The board
members and Crew have staked out firm positions, he added, ``so
obviously, it's not going to be resolved between us.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Miller is the first superintendent to be fired by Crew since
1997, when the U.S. Justice Department approved the state law
giving him broad authority over New York City's 32 community school
districts, which had operated for years as largely autonomous
fiefdoms. The department reviewed the law to determine whether it
violated the rights of minority voters by diluting the power of the
elected boards.
</P>
<P>
   Since acquiring the new powers, Crew has tried to make his mark
in many districts by removing elected school board members, firing
principals and hiring the superintendents of his choice over the
objections of some school boards.
</P>
<P>
   In dismissing Ms. Miller, the chancellor cited the criticisms of
her made in a recent report by Edward Stancik, special commissioner
of investigation for the New York City school system. The report
faulted her actions last year when a loaded revolver was found in
the backpack of an 8-year-old pupil at one of the district's
schools.
</P>
<P>
   Crew said Ms. Miller did not secure the gun and did not
immediately notify police. Stancik's report also accused her of
deliberately misleading parents by saying the gun resembled a toy.
</P>
<P>
   To fire Ms. Miller on the basis of the gun incident is
``unfair,'' Comrie said, because it ignores the educational gains
made in the district during her tenure as superintendent, including
improved reading and math scores.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's been educationally and fiscally responsible,'' he added.

ARENA PLANS IN NEW JERSEY PUT SOME RESIDENTS ON EDGE
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By ANDREW JACOBS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWARK, N.J. _ Amid the cheering of city officials hungry for a
new downtown sports arena Soraida Cruz has one thing to say: ``Over
my dead body.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Cruz, 34, whose house stands in the path of a proposed $223
million stadium for the Nets, has no desire to sacrifice the house
where she was born for a greater civic good. Nor do the 300 other
East Ward residents whose homes have been designated ``blighted''
by a city desperate for the 40-acre sports complex. ``Let them find
another way to improve Newark without hurting us,'' Mrs. Cruz said.
</P>
<P>
   Similar sentiments can be heard 10 miles away in Hoboken, where
the principal owner of the Devils, John McMullen, envisions a new
home for his hockey team.
</P>
<P>
   McMullen said last week that he wants to build an 18,500-seat
arena, two levels of shops and a 20-screen movie theater on a
platform above the railroad tracks, with a view of lower Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   But McMullen's high-tech renderings and sales pitch have won few
supporters in Hoboken, a formerly down-and-out waterfront town of
30,000 people that has seen its fortunes soar in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is he crazy or what?'' asked Charlie Raso, 71, a retired truck
driver who has spent his entire life in Hoboken. Like many
residents, Raso says the town is already suffering from too much of
a good thing: too many bars, too little parking, soaring real
estate prices and so many new faces that he and his wife feel like
foreigners when they walk down Washington Street. ``We need this
thing like I need a hole in my head,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Both proposals face daunting competition from the New Jersey
Sports and Exposition Authority, which wants to build a $212
million replacement for the Continental Airlines arena in the
Meadowlands, which is home to the Devils, the Nets, the Giants, the
Jets and the MetroStars soccer team.
</P>
<P>
   Because all three proposals would require publicly financed
infrastructure improvements, state officials say that only one of
the stadiums will be built.
</P>
<P>
   For now the sponsors of each plan are trying to win the support
of the public and, ultimately, Gov. Christie Whitman. So when Mrs.
Cruz and a group of her neighbors held a news conference on
Thursday to announce a lawsuit against the city of Newark, Mayor
Sharpe James could not contain his fury.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will not dignify disgruntled individuals who are against
everything and for nothing,'' the mayor said in a terse statement.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed sports, retail and entertainment development in
Newark would include two stadiums, one for the Nets and one for the
MetroStars and require the clearing of 20 blocks, city officials
say.
</P>
<P>
   That came as a surprise to people who live in that gritty
neighborhood of warehouses, vinyl-sided homes and parking lots. A
quick walk from Pennsylvania Station, the office cluster of
downtown Newark and the heavily Portuguese Ironbound section, the
neighborhood has no official name, and until now, no political or
economic clout.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is no Beverly Hills, but it's not as run-down as they
want people to believe,'' Mrs. Cruz said. Michael Rowe, president
of the Nets, said his team has no interest in destroying any
community. ``The whole reason we want to go into Newark is to help
people, not to send them packing,'' he said. If philanthropy is
drawing the Nets to Newark, profit is behind the Devils' decision
to abandon the Meadowlands for Hoboken. McMullen has long
complained that the Continental arena has too few of the luxury
boxes that team owners covet.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed stadium in Hoboken would have 100 corporate suites,
up from 29, and include 3,000 seats in a private club overlooking
the World Trade Center. The total price tag: $350 million.
</P>
<P>
   In choosing Hoboken, McMullen is hoping to attract more New
Yorkers, who would be able to reach the stadium by PATH train.
Hoboken is also a hub for New Jersey Transit trains that serve a
large swath of the state. The Meadowlands, on drained swampland in
Secaucus, has no rail links.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed arena would displace neither residents nor
businesses, but finding people who like the idea is not easy. Even
Hoboken's mayor, Anthony Russo, greeted the proposal with carefully
measured praise. ``It would cost the taxpayers very little, and
there would be all kinds of amenities, but we'll have to see how
it's going to affect our quality of life,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   One of his biggest concerns is the proposed highway connection.
So far, $20 million in federal transportation funds have been
earmarked for it, about a fifth of the total cost, Russo said.
``Without the infrastructure, it wouldn't look as good.''
</P>
<P>
   But most of the city's advocacy groups are opposed to the
stadium, even if a highway is built. With only a handful of access
roads, they say, this one-square-mile town would be quickly
overwhelmed by traffic before and after sporting events. ``As it is
you can't find parking if your life depended on it,'' said Ronald
Hines, chairman of the Coalition for a Better Waterfront, which has
fought for stricter development controls.
</P>
<P>
   In the last two years, city officials have approved 3,000
apartments that would increase the housing stock by 20 percent.
Those numbers frighten old-timers like Beverly Hans, who said she
moved to Hoboken in 1966 to escape the congestion of New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``I liked Hoboken when it was falling apart, when people were
ashamed to say they were from here,'' said Ms. Hans, 59, as she
served customers at the Landmark Coffee shop on Hudson Street.
``When all these new buildings fill up, it's going to be
miserable.''

DELAY SOUGHT IN PROCEEDINGS IN GRAIN ELEVATOR BLAST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICK ALM  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (KANSAS CITY, Mo.) _ Government lawyers are seeking a delay in
civil proceedings against DeBruce Grain Inc. until a parallel
criminal investigation into last year's fatal grain-elevator
explosion is concluded.
</P>
<P>
   Paul DeBruce, DuBruce founder and chief executive, said Friday
that his North Kansas City-based company will resist the delay
requested by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration.
</P>
<P>
   The June 8 grain dust explosion near Wichita, Kan., left seven
workers dead. The federal agency in December alleged three dozen
workplace-safety violations against DeBruce and proposed civil
fines totaling $1.74 million.
</P>
<P>
   DeBruce has contested those allegations and is seeking an
administrative trial. In recent weeks the company has accused the
government of foot dragging in the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``The need for openness is long overdue,'' DeBruce said Friday.
``One of OSHA's stated purposes for the stay is to prevent
(DeBruce) access to information that OSHA has already assembled,
and has made public judgment and public statements upon.''
</P>
<P>
   In announcing the proposed fines in December, Labor Secretary
Alexis Herman said: ``It is unforgivable that DeBruce officials
would so callously disregard federal safety standards. American
workers must not become victims to indifference.''
</P>
<P>
   In a motion filed earlier this week, Herman's office said the
delay was essential to prevent DeBruce from ``making use of the
liberal discovery procedures applicable to a civil suit as a dodge
to avoid the restrictions on criminal discovery and thereby obtain
documents he would not otherwise be entitled to for use in his
criminal trial.''
</P>
<P>
   Discovery is a legal procedure in which both sides must disclose
certain evidence.
</P>
<P>
   Key OSHA officials could not be reached Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Federal prosecutors in Wichita, meanwhile, are continuing to
investigate the explosion for possible criminal violations. The
case was referred to U.S. Attorney Jackie Williams in Wichita in
January by regional administrators in OSHA's Kansas City office.
</P>
<P>
   In an affidavit filed with the government's motion for the
delay, Assistant U.S. Attorney Alan G. Metzger said the criminal
investigation should be completed within six to nine months.
</P>
<P>
   In that document, Metzger said the criminal probe centers on
``alleged willful violations of the (federal workplace safety) act
which caused the death of seven employees.''
</P>
<P>
   Willful violations carry maximum civil fines of $70,000 each
plus the potential for criminal prosecution in cases of workplace
deaths.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 36 proposed violations, 26 fall into the most serious
``willful'' category. Those include at least nine instances of
inoperative grain dust collection systems.
</P>
<P>
   DeBruce officials earlier this year provided /{The Kansas City
Star/} with copies of work orders, contracts and other records
indicating that the elevator's key grain dust collection systems
had been maintained just months before the explosion.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, however, an injured worker and the families of two
who were killed sued contractor Industrial Maintenance Inc. of
Wichita.
</P>
<P>
   Their lawsuit alleges that the contractor ``failed to perform
this maintenance in a reasonably prudent manner, resulting in the
explosion.''
</P>
<P>
   DeBruce officials also have raised a new theory that a halogen
lamp used by Industrial Maintenance workers the day of the
explosion might have generated enough heat to ignite volatile grain
dust that can explode with six times the force of dynamite.
</P>
<P>
   Industrial Maintenance lawyers deny the company did anything to
contribute to the blast.
</P>
<P>
   In public statements, OSHA investigators have pointed to an
underground tunnel for grain conveyor belts as the likely spot
where the explosion originated.
</P>
<P>
   Investigator Vernon Grose told /{The Wichita Eagle/} last summer
that a seized bearing in that machinery caused friction and enough
heat to touch off the blast.
</P>
<P>
   DeBruce officials contend that couldn't be the case because
grain was not being moved in that area at the time.

REAL ESTATE: A FAN SAVES AN ART-MOVIE HOUSE IN BALTIMORE
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Md.)   (jw) 
 By CHARLES BELFOURE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BALTIMORE _ Five years ago James Cusack, a fan of offbeat films,
knew little about the movie-theater business. That changed when his
nephew, John Standiford, told him that the Charles Theater, one of
the city's two first-run art movie houses, was about to close.
</P>
<P>
   Standiford, 34, was the assistant manager of the theater; his
uncle has been a building contractor for the last 25 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had always gone to the Charles because I liked independent
films more than the big studio movies,'' Cusack said. ``I felt it
would be a big cultural loss for the city if the theater closed.''
But the former operator of the Charles had walked away, abandoning
its lease and leaving an intact movie theater, including projection
equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Cusack renegotiated the former tenant's lease with the owner,
Bowling Inc., and reopened the 485-seat, 10,000-square-foot theater
in 1994. Now he is about to complete a four-screen, 694-seat
expansion of the Charles, using the rest of the space in a
23,000-square-foot building that was once used to store and repair
cable cars and then trolley cars.
</P>
<P>
   By putting together a $1.5 million package to finance the
expansion, Cusack is not only giving Baltimore a new venue for
nontraditional films, but is also bringing the first sizable
commercial development project in four decades to a rundown section
of Charles Street, Baltimore's main thoroughfare. The Charles
Theater lies one block from Penn Station in a section that was once
a major transportation hub.
</P>
<P>
   The car barn was built in 1892 and used for its intended purpose
until 1939. Then the United Electric and Railways Co. sold the
property to Bowling Inc., which wanted it used for entertainment
activities. One initial tenant, at the south end of the building,
was the Times Theater, the city's only all-newsreel theater at the
time. Another tenant, at the north end, was a bowling alley.
</P>
<P>
   During the 1940s a new second floor was built above the bowling
alley, as the home of the Famous Ballroom, where jazz greats like
Dizzy Gillespie and Buddy Rich played. The movie theater was
renamed the Charles in 1958, and it became an art-movie house in
the late 1970s. The rest of the space has been vacant in recent
years.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago Alan Shecter, the vice president of Bowling Inc.,
gave Cusack a 40-year lease for the entire building. ``I was
impressed by Cusack's motivation and drive in operating the
theater,'' said Shecter, who would not disclose the lease's terms.
But then Cusack and Standiford had to find the financing for the
expansion. They got help from Robert Embry Jr., president of the
Abell Foundation, which provides money to organizations that
promote economic growth here. The foundation agreed to guarantee a
$720,000 loan from Mercantile Trust.
</P>
<P>
   Help also came in the form of a $485,000 low-interest loan from
the State of Maryland and a $79,000 grant from the Baltimore
Development Corp. Construction started a year ago. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The building was put on the National Register of Historic Places
in September and is eligible for the National Park Service's
historic rehabilitation tax-credit program, which will raise
additional equity to cover any cost overruns and pay down debt
service.
</P>
<P>
   To qualify for the program, the developers are restoring the
original Romanesque Revival facade of the car barn. This involves
the removal of a ceramic-tile facade added in the 1950s. It
obscured three large windows with Romanesque arches.
</P>
<P>
   Multiscreen operation is the key to survival in the
movie-theater business, Cusack said, a lesson he learned soon after
he took over the Charles in 1994. Without the current expansion,
his business would have failed, he said. ``With one screen, you're
putting all your eggs in one basket to carry the business,' he
said. ``You don't have a move-over house to shift a movie.'' In a
multiscreen building, when the popularity of a movie wanes it can
be moved to a smaller screen and still produce revenue while a new
film can be brought into the larger theater.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   With Alex Castro of Baltimore as the architect, the space has
been designed for four new screens with stadium seating. The new
screening rooms will have 123, 151, 173 and 247 seats. In addition
the original theater of 485 seats will be left intact and continue
in operation, but its lobby will be available as sublease space for
use as a cafe or restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   The entrance will be relocated in the northern part of the
building allowing the moviegoers to walk into a lobby 27 feet high,
with the original theater to the right and the new screening rooms
straight ahead. A box office and concession stand of glass,
concrete and recycled industrial steel designed by an artist, John
Maxwell, will greet patrons. The original brick walls will be left
exposed in the lobby. A stairway will take patrons to a curving
balcony leading to the top of the largest new screening room.
</P>
<P>
   In late April the rebuilt Charles will open as host for the
first Maryland Film Festival, which is to be an annual event
presented by the Producers Club of Maryland, based in Baltimore, an
organization that supports and raises funds for the state of
Maryland Film Office.
</P>
<P>
   It will run for four days, starting April 22, showing a mix of
new films, documentaries and restored films. After the festival the
theater will show first-run independent films as well as classic
Hollywood and foreign films, as the Charles now does. Its current
offering is ``The General,'' directed by John Boorman.
</P>
<P>
   If the Charles succeeds, there is the expectation that new
businesses will follow. ``We would like to see more bar and
restaurant potential once the Charles is up and running,'' said Jay
Brodie, president of the Baltimore Development Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Although the theater is the most important project in the area,
there are other evolving development efforts around Penn Station,
according to Brodie. Amtrak is considering putting a hotel in the
unused upper floors of the station as well as relocating the
Greyhound station to a new facility in an adjacent parking lot.
Three blocks to the south, the University of Baltimore is planning
a major expansion, including its first housing for students. There
have been only a few isolated attempts to renovate the deteriorated
housing to the east.
</P>
<P>
   The Charles has developed a loyal following. Though the
immediate neighborhood has had little new commercial investment,
surrounding areas are more affluent, with the Johns Hopkins
community a mile to the north, and the Maryland Institute College
of Art four blocks to the south.
</P>
<P>
   The presence of a new police kiosk now monitoring 20 new
surveillance cameras in the surrounding blocks will, planners
believe, draw many more people who were reluctant to visit an area
they perceived as unsafe. In an attempt to lessen fears about car
break-ins, there will be a reduced parking fee for patrons in lots
surrounding the movie house.
</P>
<P>
   One of the few historic elements on the interior of the car barn
is a marble plaque with the names of the people involved in the
original construction of the building in 1892. The last name listed
will bring a smile to most Charles moviegoers. The superintendent
of construction, John Waters shares the same name as the theater's
most famous patron, the director John Waters, who is enthusiastic
about the Charles' second life.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Charles is important to the cultural life of this city,''
said Waters, director of the 1972 cult classic ``Pink Flamingos,''
whose latest film is ``Pecker.'' ``I know people who move out of
cities because there aren't any good movies.''

COMPANY OFFERS INTERNET SCREENING SERVICE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOYCE SMITH  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (KANSAS CITY, Mo.) _ A 30-something man with a scruffy stubble
and a glint in his eye is cruising the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   In a chat with a girl, he types: ``I'm an 11-year-old girl. My
favorite color is purple. I like to hang out at the malls. What
mall do you go to? Maybe we should meet there sometime.''
</P>
<P>
   Though this man is just an actor in a commercial, the sort of
activity he portrays is real _ and especially scary for parents.
The company running the ad, Safeconnect Inc. of Lenexa, Kan., hopes
to put to rest those fears about the dark side of the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   This week, Safeconnect began providing Internet connection
service across the country, but with a family twist. The company's
service points users to a family-friendly Web site and filters out
other sites that promote pornography, drug use, violence and hate.
</P>
<P>
   Safeconnect's family network, www.efamily.net, provides or links
to news, stores, cartoons, sports scores, television listings,
movie reviews and other content suitable for younger audiences. It
also will offer some type of online chat service for children.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're really trying to target the family and people that maybe
are not real familiar with the Internet,'' said Kathleen Piper,
president of Safeconnect. ``For example, we'll have links to
multiple family vacation planning sites. It's hard for a novice ...
to figure out where to go or how to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Safeconnect, available at {www.safeconnect.com,} is the latest
Internet service to enter the online family market.
</P>
<P>
   In Kansas City, Safe4Kids has been offering a similar service
since March 1998, said Grant Rogers, vice president and general
manager of Rocky Mountain Internet. The service, at
{www.safe4kids.com}, offers Internet access for $21.95 a month, a
little more than Safeconnect.
</P>
<P>
   Rogers said the service had been ``steadily growing, but not
fast-growing,'' since its debut.
</P>
<P>
   The most widely recognized family Internet service was launched
in March 1996 by CompuServe, then a subsidiary of H&AMP;R Block Inc. of
Kansas City. Wow, an online service that used its own software
while offering limited access to the Internet, was criticized for
not offering enough content for the preteen crowd it focused on.
</P>
<P>
   The project was a financial disaster for Block and CompuServe.
It was abandoned in January 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Without the sort of filtering Safeconnect offers, concerned
parents instead can buy a ``content blocker'' program. It must be
updated frequently, and even then it doesn't block all the Web
sites a parent might want to avoid. And as children get older, they
often figure out how to turn off the blocking program.
</P>
<P>
   But with Safeconnect, Piper said, ``you don't have to worry
about the kids going around the system. That stuff doesn't even
come into your home, much less your computer.''
</P>
<P>
   Safeconnect plans to search the Web constantly, examining
patterns of words, word forms and picture scanning to predict
high-risk sites. The sites will then be reviewed individually.
While some filtering systems automatically block the word
``breast,'' for example, Safeconnect will allow information on,
say, breast cancer research.
</P>
<P>
   T. Scott Jenkins came up with Safeconnect after trying to
introduce his oldest daughter to the Internet. When he began
researching sites he found questionable material on some of the
most innocent searches.
</P>
<P>
   A search of ``Little Women'' can bring up such sites as ``nude
women at clubtease'' and ``best photos plus XXX erotic diaries.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We were searching `American Girl,' a brand name for a doll,''
Jenkins said. ``I saw a lot of American girls that didn't have
clothes on. It's deceptive. They buy a lot of key words that are
wholesome. Kids type them in and get somewhere they shouldn't go.''
</P>
<P>
   Jenkins spent two years researching the market and getting the
support centers together. Don Peterson, founder of DeskStation
Technology Inc., served as a consultant to Safeconnect.
</P>
<P>
   Parents can override Safeconnect's filtering with special
access. And if their computer-savvy child breaks the code,
Safeconnect will send a coded message to the parents' private
e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   Randy Wilson of Focus on the Family, a Colorado Springs, Colo.,
organization that strives to strengthen families, said Safeconnect
found good companies to link to its site.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've done some really creative things in that realm,''
Wilson said. ``I sense that it is a new generation of Internet
services.''
</P>
<P>
   Safeconnect works with any standard browser and is nationally
available through high-speed local-access numbers in more than 267
U.S. cities. The company has 10 employees and a $4 million
advertising budget for this year. Eventually it hopes to offer the
service internationally.
</P>
<P>
   People subscribing just to Safeconnect's filtering system pay $5
a month. Unlimited access to the Internet and the use of the
filtering system costs $20 a month.
</P>
<P>
   Safeconnect also will focus on businesses that are concerned
about employees surfing the Net instead of working, and on
libraries, which have struggled with First Amendment issues when
trying to screen sites.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, more and more we are hearing about child being
lured through chat rooms,'' Piper said. ``With Safeconnect,
children will be safe, they can come home do their homework, and
parents will be confident that they are on the Internet they will
be safe.''

 FROM A TOUGH PRINCIPAL, LESSONS IN RESPONSIBILITY

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWARK, N.J. _ Vanessa McNeil was a freshman at West Side High
School here when the state took over the Newark schools because of
low academic achievement and corruption at the central office.
</P>
<P>
   At that time, Vanessa remembered, her school in Newark's gritty
West Ward was about everything but learning.
</P>
<P>
   ``It smelled in the hallways,'' she said. ``Someone drove a car
into the gym. Computers were stolen. Smoke alarms were always going
off.''
</P>
<P>
   Vanessa, who is now a senior, and her friends do not know much
about who is in charge at the central office on Cedar Street in
downtown Newark. But they see a cleaner school and improved spirit.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has become a great school,'' Vanessa said.
</P>
<P>
   They credit the principal, Fernard Williams Sr., who was
appointed by Superintendent Beverly Hall two years ago to head the
school of 1,185 students. He is the fourth principal since Vanessa
was a freshman. Williams, a 54-year-old a former Marine and Newark
police officer who also graduated from West Side and was later a
teacher there, believes the details matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``He took charge of the school,'' Vanessa said. ``He gave us
discipline.''
</P>
<P>
   When he was appointed principal in 1997, West Side was one of
the worst schools in the city. The physical changes now are
dramatic. Inside and out, it is immaculate, and Williams is even
growing grass on the long-barren front lawn. There are changes in
attitude, too. Williams got rid of some teachers and other staff
members. He had new curriculum ideas.
</P>
<P>
   He stresses responsibility. To make sure that custodians have
examined every corner of the school, he occasionally uses a trick
he learned in the Marines: He scatters an unspecified number of
screws around the building and tells the custodians that he expects
all of the screws to be on his desk by the end of the day.
</P>
<P>
   When students are absent or late for school, an automated system
calls the parents that evening, and then calls them again about
6:30 the next morning to remind the students to be on time.
</P>
<P>
   The dropout rate at West Side has gone from 9.5 percent to 2.3
percent since Williams arrived at the school. Attendance is now up
to 90 percent from the low 60s.
</P>
<P>
   ``The teachers have to have high standards to make the students
competitive,'' he said. ``The students can sense when teachers are
not teaching, and then you have discipline problems. It's a growing
process.''
</P>
<P>
   But test scores have not improved as quickly as attendance. In
the statewide High School Proficiency Test, West Side 11th graders
raised their scores last year in the writing portion _ with 56.5
percent of the students passing the test, up from 42.1 percent in
1997. But the results were almost the same in math _ 29.3 percent
last year, compared with 27.7 percent _ and showed no improvement
at all in reading, which remained at 30.0 percent. The results
disappoint Williams and his students.
</P>
<P>
   But the students still feel good about what is happening.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the first school I ever came to where I ever learned
anything,'' said Jerrell Smith, 18 and a senior, who is in his
fifth year of high school and says he believes he would have
dropped out had it not been for Williams.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can come to Mr. Williams anytime I need, and he talks to me
man to man,'' he said. ``A lot of us are from broken homes, and
he's like a father figure to us. I think I'd be locked up by now if
it weren't for him.''

SENATE ENDORSES AID PACKAGE FOR HOG FARMERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN MURPHY  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Farmers hit by plummeting hog prices would get $250
million in federal help under legislation the Senate passed at the
urging of Sens. John Ashcroft and Kit Bond of Missouri, one of the
nation's largest hog-producing states.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate tacked the hog amendment onto an emergency
appropriations bill it sent to the House late Thursday night. It
would require House approval and the president's signature.
</P>
<P>
   Pork prices dropped about 70 percent from June through earlier
this year, Ashcroft said. Prices fell to less than 9 cents a pound,
then rebounded to about 26 to 27 cents _ but they're still low,
said Dan Cassidy, director of national legislative programs for
Missouri Farm Bureau.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to recoup some of those losses to enable
producers to remain in business until they at least can recover
their cost of production,'' Cassidy said.
</P>
<P>
   Ashcroft told the Senate Thursday night that 25 percent to 40
percent of Missouri's 5,500 hog farmers could lose their farms if
they don't get help. He said it is an economic disaster equivalent
to what a tornado or flood would cause.
</P>
<P>
   ``At one point, the feed the hogs were eating was worth more
than the hogs themselves,'' Ashcroft said. ``And not long ago,
consumers were paying more for a canned ham than the 260-pound hog
it came from.''
</P>
<P>
   Hog prices fell after supply far outpaced demand. A processing
strike in Canada flooded the U.S. market with hogs while export
markets dried up in the Far East and Europe, Ashcroft said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had more hogs than we could process, so packers and
processors had no incentive to offer a fair price,'' Cassidy said.
``Farmers had to hold hogs longer, they were getting fatter and
they were pumping more into hogs that were worth less.''
</P>
<P>
   The appropriations bill the Senate passed Thursday would give
$150 million in new money to the Department of Agriculture for hog
farmers and would let the department spend $100 million in existing
funds. President Clinton has proposed $50 million in aid.
</P>
<P>
   If the bill passes, the Department of Agriculture would decide
how and when to distribute money to the hog farmers who apply.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will be very attentive from a senatorial point of view to
see that the distribution is equitable and prompt,'' Ashcroft said
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Ashcroft and Bond said they have heard from the Farm Bureau, the
Missouri Pork Producers and many farmers about the hog price
problem. The senators were among several sponsors of the amendment
for $250 million in aid.

SPORTS COLUMN: CONNECTICUT KNOWS DRILL FOR REGIONAL 
 (DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By GEORGE VECSEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ Sometimes painful experience makes you conservative,
sometimes it makes you brash. Connecticut was trying the audacious
route this time, confronting the label of abject underachievers who
had never reached the Final Four of college basketball.
</P>
<P>
   Having lost three regional finals in nine previous seasons,
Connecticut decided to think big Saturday as it played surprising
Gonzaga for the right to go to the Final Four. Connecticut won,
67-62.
</P>
<P>
   The Huskies probably knew that a loss to Gonzaga could be the
worst jolt in their collective history of failed missions _ an
upset for the ages, truth be known _ but they were taking that
chance. They were defying the oldest sports cliche of all, the one
about playing the games one at a time. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``One of our guys in the locker room said _ and I'm not going to
name names _ that we were trying to get to the Final Four,'' said
Ricky Moore, the co-captain, who recalled how the other co-captain,
Rashamel Jones, quickly retorted that Connecticut was planning to
win the entire tournament.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guy just said: `You're right. Hit me on the back of the
head,''' Moore replied.
</P>
<P>
   Why not? People have been whacking Connecticut on the back of
the head for all of this decade, making the Huskies pay for the
terrible crime of excellence. Under Jim Calhoun, the big, hearty
coach who rescued this program in 1986-87, the Huskies had won 301
games and lost 120, a .714 percentage.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Connecticut had been stereotyped as a disappointing
basketball school because it had not reached the Final Four while
schools like Mississippi State, Oklahoma State, Seton Hall,
Massachusetts and Minnesota managed to get there once each in the
past decade.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about his biggest disappointment, Calhoun has said, ``The
impression that we are not successful.'' There is the perception
that going to the Final Four is a validation of a program, quite
different from the professional football perception that the team
that loses the Super Bowl is indeed a blatant loser.
</P>
<P>
   ``You mean, you want to go back to the old days?'' Calhoun
blusters sometimes, a not particularly veiled reference to the
previous regimes when Connecticut was pleased to play a second game
in the Big East tournament, just to get close to weekend
excitement.
</P>
<P>
   Going into Saturday, the disappointment sat there in the record
books. Calhoun was asked if he had learned anything over the years,
and he rattled off his lessons:
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't let Christian Laettner into the game. Make all your foul
shots. Don't go into overtime. Don't get into a shootout with UCLA.
And by the way, don't go to Greensboro, if you get a chance.''
</P>
<P>
   Connecticut fans know the drill. In the 1990 regional final in
the Meadowlands, Laettner of Duke sank a jumper in the closing
seconds in the Meadowlands to kill Connecticut (on a play revised
by coach Mike Krzyzewski in a second huddle).
</P>
<P>
   In the 1991 regional semifinal, Duke whacked Connecticut by 14.
In 1994, Donyell Marshall sleep-walked through a second-round loss
to Florida. In 1995, UCLA outran Connecticut, 102-96, in the West
Regional final. In 1996, there was a third-round loss to
Mississippi State. Last year the Huskies went to Greensboro _ a
short hop from the North Carolina campus _ and lost to the Tar
Heels by 11 in the regional final.
</P>
<P>
   ``They had three players go into the pros,'' Calhoun noted the
other day.
</P>
<P>
   The coach has figured it all out. He has all the responses. His
record is one of the best of the decade. His players also go into
pro ball. But something has been denied Jim Calhoun, and he has
brooded over the circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   ``I ask the question sometimes whether the Chicago Bulls would
have won six championships if they had a one-loss-and-out
tournament,'' Calhoun mused.
</P>
<P>
   What was his answer?
</P>
<P>
   Not necessarily.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe they'd play the A game every time out, or maybe they
wouldn't,'' Calhoun said. ``That's what makes this all the more
exciting _ great for the fans, great for the kids.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   So, the national tournament is more fun than the NBA
championships?
</P>
<P>
   ``Fun'' is not how I'd describe it,'' Calhoun replied.
</P>
<P>
   He has won more than 7 of every 10 games at Connecticut, but
Calhoun had things to prove. He was bluntly honest about this
tournament. On Friday he said he was sure he could beat six of the
seven survivors _ ``and one I'm not so sure about,'' he said,
referring to Duke. ``You'd have to play your A game to do it, maybe
get three early fouls on some of them.''
</P>
<P>
   On Friday he said, ``We're playing 40 minutes to punch our
ticket to the Final Four.'' He dared to suggest that the ticket was
for a ride long overdue, and that he would just as soon keep
riding. &QL;

ANTIQUE CLOCK FETCHES $175,000 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN A. DVORAK  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOPEKA _ They're remodeling Cedar Crest, the Kansas governor's
residence, and to raise money they held a little yard sale, so to
speak.
</P>
<P>
   They did pretty well.
</P>
<P>
   What state administrators dubbed the ``old clock,'' an antique
that visitors to Cedar Crest might not have even noticed, fetched
$175,000.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, this wasn't a typical yard sale. Nobody at the
Capitol recalls a transaction quite like it. Taxpayers are the
ultimate beneficiaries.
</P>
<P>
   The object of attention: a Simon Willard lighthouse clock, made
in 1825, very rare, highly valued by collectors and donated for
Cedar Crest eight years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Even before the construction project started, having the antique
around made Cedar Crest administrator Jennie Rose nervous.
</P>
<P>
   Cedar Crest isn't a museum, after all. It's a well-used
residence, the latest occupants being Gov. Bill Graves, first lady
Linda Graves and their 3-year-old daughter, Katie.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't want that clock broken on my watch,'' Rose said. ``It
was always a concern.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, as the remodeling began, an idea surfaced to both
generate funds and resolve questions about the safety of the
handsome, lighthouse-shaped, glass-topped clock.
</P>
<P>
   Sell it.
</P>
<P>
   Friends of Cedar Crest, a private nonprofit group that is trying
to raise $2 million for the remodeling project, made the decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a long debate,'' Rose said. ``If someone gives a
gift, you don't turn around and sell it.''
</P>
<P>
   Cooper Woodring, a former board member of Friends of Cedar
Crest, suggested the sale, she said.
</P>
<P>
   A Topeka resident, Woodring had donated the clock on behalf of
his father, the late Harry Woodring, governor of Kansas from 1931
to 1933 and later secretary of war under President Franklin D.
Roosevelt.
</P>
<P>
   Woodring knew that Friends of Cedar Crest would be attempting to
raise private funds for the remodeling project and that proceeds
from the clock would aid the project.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was his idea,'' Rose said.
</P>
<P>
   Woodring disagrees. ``It was not my idea,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Woodring doesn't directly criticize the sale. ``I'm not enamored
with it, but I'm not displeased,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Woodring said some potential donors may wonder in the
future about giving artifacts to the state if they think the state
may peddle the artifacts later.
</P>
<P>
   The state routinely sells surplus property such as old
furniture, computers and motor vehicles. But no one can remember
the state selling anything like an antique clock worth six figures.
</P>
<P>
   Administrators at the Division of Purchases were assigned the
task.
</P>
<P>
   They advertised in national magazines of interest to antique and
art experts. Bids were sought but came in too low.
</P>
<P>
   Negotiations with the highest bidder, clock expert Robert Cheney
of Brimfield, Mass., produced the $175,000 sales price.
</P>
<P>
   Last week Cheney came to Topeka and took possession of the
antique, which he reportedly bought on behalf of an unnamed
collector.
</P>

   John Stephens, curator of the Willard House and Clock Museum in
Grafton, Mass., said in a telephone interview that fewer than 200
of the lighthouse clocks were made from 1820 to 1840.
</P>
<P>
   About one a year sells, he said. But he hadn't heard of a state
government offering them on bid.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a new one,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Stephens said that selling through an art auction could have
brought a better price. State administrators question that.
Transporting the clock to an auction would have been expensive, as
would the sales commission, they said.
</P>
<P>
   In its final weeks with the state, the clock resided in a Topeka
bank vault for safekeeping. Cedar Crest is closed during the
reconstruction.
</P>
<P>
   Jack Brier, vice president of Friends of Cedar Crest, said half
the sale proceeds go to his organization and half go to state
government. All the money is destined for the Cedar Crest project,
said Brier, a former secretary of state.
</P>
<P>
   The Kansas Legislature has appropriated $1.3 million for the
project, but that won't be enough. Proceeds from the clock sale
will ease the shortfall.
</P>
<P>
   Brier learned what the clock was worth only in the last year. On
previous visits to the residence, the clock made enough of an
impression for him to remember it. But, he added, ``not a $175,000
impression.''

 Dow's dance around 10,000 will be entertaining  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY HEASTER  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's worth noting that after the Dow Jones industrial average
crossed 10,000 for the first time Tuesday, declining stocks at
day's end outnumbered gainers by a significant margin in all major
trading arenas.
</P>
<P>
   It was, therefore, a historic moment worthy of brief
celebration, but hardly a cause for optimism. Despite the solid
gains of the major indexes so far in '99, this market's leadership
seems perilously narrow.
</P>
<P>
   A recent analysis by The New York Times focused on research
showing just how rickety the overall market is. It showed 92
percent of the Nasdaq stocks and 70 percent of the Standard &AMP;
Poor's 500 index stocks below their highs by 10 percent or more.
Meanwhile, a recent Dow Theory Forecasts analysis noted that fully
70 percent of the New York Stock Exchange stocks were trading at
least 25 percent below their 52-week highs.
</P>
<P>
   So if you've been in the right stocks, or mutual funds owning
the right stocks, you've been making money. If not, you're no doubt
wondering what all the excitement is about. This, of course, is the
way the market always works, but the imbalance between winners and
losers seems dangerously out of kilter.
</P>
<P>
   Another red flag mentioned by The Times was the Salomon Smith
Barney laggards indicator, which measures the number of stocks
underperforming the S&AMP;P 500 by 15 percent or more. Some 75 percent
now qualify as laggards, and a Salomon analyst cautioned that big
market corrections had occurred three of four times when this
indicator topped 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
   It's not as if 10,000 on the Dow isn't an important number. It
is probably the most symbolic number since the blue-chip indicator
first topped 1,000. It did so during intraday trading in early
1966, just as it did Tuesday, but didn't close above 1,000 until
November 1972.
</P>
<P>
   If history repeats, 10,000 could become a ceiling rather than a
floor. After the Dow held 1,000 briefly through early '73, it began
a descent to 578, where it bottomed in December 1974. It regained
1,000 for brief periods again in 1976, 1980 and 1981, but it wasn't
until December 1982 that the Dow finally transformed 1,000 from
ceiling to launching pad.
</P>
<P>
   Barring an unforeseen collapse of the world's economy, which
hardly seems likely, it's not probable 10,000 will be nearly the
restraining force 1,000 was. At the 1,000 level, the world was
facing a mounting array of seemingly intractable economic problems
unsurpassed since the Great Depression of the 1930s.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, 10,000 could prove a much more difficult hurdle to
get past than the other thousand milestones since a four-digit Dow
became a permanent fact of life. The pessimists say 10,000
represents for many investors a signal to trim sail. Moreover, the
longer it takes the market to secure this new high ground
permanently, the more psychologically daunting it becomes.
</P>
<P>
   The optimists say once breached, however, 10,000 will become a
strong psychological floor from which the market will soar. The
road to 11,000 or even 12,000 will be a relative cakewalk, they
say.
</P>
<P>
   Either way, the Dow's entertainment value for the rest of the
year will be high even if the average has trouble deciding whether
10,000 is a floor or ceiling.

BALLPARK JUST WON'T CUT IT FOR FINAL FOUR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By LES POLK  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Imagine an NCAA Final Four in Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   Bank One Ballpark rocking with 30-40,000 basketball fans, the
national media frenzy, the tourists and bigshots and students
flocking to town.
</P>
<P>
   March Madness.
</P>
<P>
   Uh, wait a second. Keep dreaming. There's a small matter of the
Arizona Diamondbacks, a grass ballfield, and the opening of
baseball season falling at the same time as the Final Four. Or as
one ballpark official puts it, ``logistical nightmare.''
</P>
<P>
   Turn your thoughts to Mesa, though, and the proposed Rio Salado
Crossing, a $1.8 billion complex that would include a retractable
roof football stadium, convention center, hotels, shops,
restaurants and a network of parks.
</P>
<P>
   The hoops dream may be more realistic there, because if the
project is approved in May, officials vow to pursue the Final Four,
which is booked through 2007.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will go out and bid for that, yes,'' said Robert Brinton,
head of the Mesa Convention and Visitors Bureau. ``Until we're for
real though, there's not a lot you can talk about.''
</P>
<P>
   The bid would have to be made in conjunction with Arizona State
University, which would be the host school, after the NCAA
expresses interest in having the area host the event.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we're interested in talking to them about it,'' said
Tom Sadler, an assistant athletic director at ASU and tournament
manager for the NCAA Western Regional this weekend at America West
Arena.
</P>
<P>
   Sadler said he has also discussed the idea with BOB officials.
</P>
<P>
   NCAA officials say the Phoenix area would be an ideal site for a
Final Four but share the same concerns as local officials about the
logistics at Bank One Ballpark.
</P>
<P>
   ``Phoenix certainly is a wonderful destination city that would
be a terrific site for a Final Four down the road,'' said Bill
Hancock, a director of the NCAA Men's Basketball Tournament.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's had great success with the Super Bowl and Fiesta Bowls.
The Final Four could fit right in there.''
</P>
<P>
   Hancock, who has yet to see Bank One Ballpark, said he would be
concerned about the logistics.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know that it has a grass field and we've never had the Final
Four in a dome anyplace that has a grass field,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   It wouldn't be the first Final Four at baseball stadium. In
fact, next Saturday's Final Four will be played at Tropicana Field,
home of the Tampa Bay Devil Rays. But Tropicana's turf is
artificial and easy to store away.
</P>
<P>
   Don't plan on it at BOB. Bob Machen, president and general
manager of Bank One Ballpark and America West Arena, said that
although Diamondbacks officials have discussed the idea of trying
to land an NCAA Final four and would like to, it isn't realistic.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we had a carpet (artificial turf) down we would have
pursued it already,'' Machen said.
</P>
<P>
   Machen said because of the basketball court courtside seating
being on the baseball field, media arrangements and a host of other
issues, it would be impractical to arrange shortly before or right
at the start of baseball season.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, for example, the championship game at the Alamodome
in San Antonio was March 30.
</P>
<P>
   Opening Day at Bank One Ballpark was the next day.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just isn't something that could be done now,'' Machen said.
</P>
<P>
   Hancock said that not only would the basketball court have to be
placed on the field, but there are a large number of courtside
premium seats, media seats, band seats and then portable bleachers
courtside on one side of the floor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those bleachers would have to be resting on something pretty
solid, so there are some logistical concerns that would certainly
have to be addressed on the grass field,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Others agree that because of BOB's grass field, which will have
to be grown fresh before every season after a winter of indoor
racing, concerts and other events, the stadium is unlikely to be
sought for a Final Four.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one of those things that physically it's possible, but
it's not likely because the field is just going in,'' said Roger
Brendeckie, administrator of the Maricopa County Stadium District.
``It's just doing too much and could have an adverse effect on the
field. What's the tolerance of pain for the turf?''
</P>
<P>
   In the first season, the specially grown turf at BOB often
turned brown and had to be replaced in spots. This season, special
turf has been abandoned for a Kentucky Bluegass and some have
questioned its ability to survive an Arizona summer.
</P>
<P>
   At the proposed Mesa stadium, the grass football field would be
on rollers and could be moved outside at any time, leaving a
concrete floor that could be configured into a basketball court
suitable for the NCAA as well as other uses for the adjacent
convention center.
</P>
<P>
   The NCAA's Hancock said he is familiar with the proposed Mesa
stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``It sounds like a very interesting situation to me,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Requirements for hosting a Final Four include a minimum of
30,000 seats, 8,000 hotel rooms and a working press room for 400
media people, with an interview room for 300.
</P>
<P>
   The Valley could meet that criteria at either BOB or a new Cards
stadium, although hotel arrangements would have to be made far in
advance because March is peak season in the Valley.
</P>
<P>
   Hancock said securing the rooms at high season in a Sunbelt area
can be difficult, but he said St. Petersburg, Fla., host of this
season's Final Four, handled it well.

 &HT;    As QBs sign, Jeff George waits
 &HT;    By Len Pasquarelli
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ While the owners seemed mired in intertia during last
week's NFL meetings, some coaches kept the game of quarterback
musical chairs going long enough to maintain interest. Before the
meetings had adjourned, three former starters _ Scott Mitchell
(Detroit to Baltimore), Jim Harbaugh (Baltimore to San Diego) and
Glenn Foley (N.Y. Jets to Seattle) _ changed teams in trades.
</P>
<P>
   The one quarterback still scrambling for a chair, however, as
the music winds down is Jeff George. Whatever ill-will remains
toward George in Atlanta, even his critics have to concede the lack
of interest in him, particularly when players like Chris Miller,
Todd Marinovich, Andre Ware and Mark Rypien are attempting
comebacks, is inexplicable.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, there's nothing going on,'' George agent Leigh
Steinberg said at the meetings. ``Part of it was the timing
because, had we known the Raiders weren't going to keep him, we
would have started shopping him. But (Raiders vice president) Bruce
Allen negotiated as if we were trying to come to a deal. (Now)
we've pulled him back. Nothing will happen at least until after the
draft.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the coaches surveyed here agreed George has more talent
than any of the guys signed as free agents _ Rich Gannon (Oakland),
Kerry Collins (N.Y. Giants), Trent Green (St. Louis) and Doug
Pederson (Philadelphia). And certainly he carries less baggage than
Collins. But the coaches, almost to a man, cited George's losing
record in the NFL and a perception he is not close to his
teammates.
</P>
<P>
   There are rumblings Jimmy Johnson is tempted to bring George to
Miami as a backup to Dan Marino. And Dennis Green, publicly
confident in Randall Cunningham but privately wary he could
backslide in Minnesota, has some interest.
</P>
<P>
   It may take an injury in camp to get George a job. That his
situation has degenerated to that is more a factor of coaching
shortsightedness than George's own shortcomings.
</P>
<P>
   Tuning in
</P>
<P>
   Beyond their lack of action on most issues, what most marked the
owners last week was their hypocrisy. The league will give Los
Angeles the opportunity for the 32nd franchise based primarily on
its edge in ``TV households'' (5.5 million-4.0 million) over
Houston, even though the latter is clearly more prepared for a new
team. But all the owners who recently relocated teams _ Art Modell
(Baltimore), Georgia Frontiere (St. Louis), Al Davis (Oakland), Bud
Adams (Nashville), Bill Bidwill (Arizona) and Bob Kraft (Hartford)
_ went from bigger to smaller markets. It didn't seem to matter in
those cases. San Diego owner Alex Spanos chided Adams and Kraft for
pushing the Los Angeles market so hard, but he still voted for L.A.
</P>
<P>
   Tip sheet
</P>
<P>
   Although he's visited Chicago and New England, the most likely
landing spot for free agent linebacker Jamir Miller of Arizona is
with Tennessee. General manager Floyd Reese has been trying to work
on numbers with agent Steve Baker for three weeks, but the Titans
have only $87,000 left in the cap and will have to reshuffle some
contracts to make room. Coach Steve Fisher wants to use Miller much
like he did Lamar Lathon, to rush off the edge, a tactic that would
net the linebacker 10-12 sacks. . . . The Cowboys quietly have
reached a five-year agreement with free agent center Mark
Stepnoski. . . . Defensive end Charles Haley played so well in two
postseason appearances last year that 49ers coach Steve Mariucci
and club president Bill Walsh want him back for '99. . . . Steelers
owner Dan Rooney met with Steinberg and began earnest negotiations
on an extension for quarterback Kordell Stewart. . . . Carolina
linebacker Kevin Greene may talk himself right out of a job. New
Panthers coach George Seifert feels Greene would be perfect for the
``elephant'' pass-rush position his defense uses. But Greene told
Seifert he is still an every-down linebacker, something he really
hasn't been for six years. . . . Jets coach Bill Parcells denies he
turned down an offer of a second-round draft choice for third-year
vet linebacker James Farrior. . . . Owners quietly awarded the
Patriots $335,000 in cap relief for '99 _ the base salary for
Robert Edwards _ to compensate for the loss of the tailback to what
likely is a career-ending knee injury.
</P>
<P>
   Something for nothing
</P>
<P>
   Few owners probably know about Carlton Sheets, the king of
late-night infomercials and the guy who tells viewers how they can
buy real estate with no money down. Turns out New York businessman
Howard Milstein, the potential new owner in Washington, is the
Carlton Sheets of the NFL. Milstein had no cash of his own in his
$800 million bid for the Skins. He has three more weeks to address
concerns about his financing. His partner, Bethesda, Md.,
businessman Daniel Snyder, may split from Milstein to try to buy
the team himself.
</P>
<P>
   Film study
</P>
<P>
   New York Giants coach Jim Fassel two weeks ago dusted off an
instructional video he made with John Elway in 1982, before the
quarterback's senior season at Stanford. Fassel, the Stanford
quarterbacks coach at the time, wasn't in the mood for nostalgia.
Instead he showed the 45-minute video, which concentrates primarily
on mechanics and has no voice-over, to Collins. Despite the
protests of Fassel and general manager Ernie Accorsi, everyone
assumes Collins will beat Kent Graham for the starting job.
</P>
<P>
   Still the Champ
</P>
<P>
   Georgia cornerback Champ Bailey solidified his status as a top
pick in the draft at his on-campus workout last week. In front of
scouts for about 20 teams, Bailey clocked 4.28-4.31 in the 40,
depending on whose stopwatch you trust. He had a 42 1/2-inch
vertical jump and 11-foot, 3-inch broad jump, all impressive
figures. Suddenly, now the Colts, who had been locked on Southern
Cal linebacker Chris Claiborne with the fourth overall selection on
April 17, are indicating big interest in Bailey. Indy has a pair of
$4 million-a-year corners in Jeff Burris and Tyrone Poole, but
coach Jim Mora agreed at the meetings his defense needs another
player at that position.
</P>
<P>
   The last word(s)
</P>
<P>
   Cincinnati coach Bruce Coslet, on the new instant replay system,
which is based on a coach's challenge: ``Oh, great, now I get to
put `referee' on my resume.

 &HT;    Scientists' meeting brings Nobel winners together with students
 &HT;    By Charles Seabrook
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ You could feel the intelligence.
</P>
<P>
   Forty-three winners of the Nobel Prize in science were having
lunch Saturday with some Georgia high schoolers and teachers in
meeting rooms 260 and 261of the Georgia World Congress Center _ the
largest gathering ever of Nobel laureates outside Stockholm, where
the coveted award is presented annually.
</P>
<P>
   The 85 high school students were all from Georgia; the 52
science teachers were from every state in the union, Washington,
D.C., and Puerto Rico. The kids were pretty smart themselves _ at
least 16 had scored a perfect 1600 on their SATs.
</P>
<P>
   For the students, it was a stunning opportunity to chat
face-to-face with the giants of science, the very people
responsible for the great scientific discoveries that fill the
pages of their textbooks.
</P>
<P>
   What do so many super-bright people talk about while munching on
salad, chicken and chocolate dessert?
</P>
<P>
   ``We talked about the 'Three Little Pigs,' `` said 1998 Nobel
winner in physics Horst Stormer of Bell Laboratories.
</P>
<P>
   ``Actually, we were chatting about how we use the story to teach
physics to first graders,'' said Paul Mello, a science teacher in
Middletown, R.I., seated next to Stormer. ``We get them to look at
various types of material and see what is strongest and weakest and
what falls down down in the wind. In a way, they're learning about
some physics concepts.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It sounds like a wonderful away of teaching,'' said Stormer.
</P>
<P>
   Across the room, Daniel Perry, a senior at Cedar Shoals High
School in Athens, and Benjamin Watson, a senior at Hardaway High
School in Columbus, were seated on either side of Walter Kohn, the
1998 Nobel winner in chemistry.
</P>
<P>
   ``He actually knew Einstein, and was friends with him,'' said
Perry. ``He was very easy to talk to, and he had a personal story
for everything we brought up.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He told us about how we can accomplish whatever we want to do
if we put our minds to it,'' said Watson, who intends to get a
degree in communications technology and then become a U.S. Air
Force pilot.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, Kohn, for the benefit of the two students, pointed
out another Nobel laureate, Hans Bethe, sitting across the room.
Bethe was the first scientist to describe the nuclear fusion
process by which the sun gets its energy. Later, he played a prime
role in the Manhattan Project that built the atomic bombs dropped
on Hiroshima and Nagasaki during World War II.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see myself as a bridge between these young people and the
great people of science whom I knew,'' said Kohn. ``These students
sitting here today, though, don't need any motivation from me;
they're already motivated about science.''
</P>
<P>
   The luncheon was part of the first-day activities at the meeting
of the American Physical Society in Atlanta this week. Billed as
the biggest physics meeting in history, it is attracting more than
10,000 physicists from all over the nation and the world, who will
present more than 8,000 research papers on everything from galactic
clusters to quarks, the tiniest bits of matter.
</P>
<P>
   What makes the meeting so big is that it is the 100th
anniversary of the APS, the leading society for physicists in the
United States and for many abroad.
</P>
<P>
   Meridith Owensby, a senior at Alexander High School in Douglas
County and a perfect scorer on the SAT, was nestled between Charles
Townes, whose discovery of the laser won him the Nobel Prize in
physics, and Allen Bromley, the White House science adviser during
the Bush adminstration.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a little overwhelmed,'' said Owensby, who plans to attend
Georgia Tech and major in physics.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were telling her about how physics tries to develop a
fundamental understanding of nature, and how one day she may help
achieve that,'' said Bromley. ``With a perfect SAT score, she could
have her choice of schools.''
</P>
<P>
   Even after the luncheon, physics teacher Pat Waddell of the
Darlington School in Rome was still starry eyed. She had sat with
Georg Bednorz, who won the Nobel for helping discover
superconductivity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, I'm the most excited physics teacher you'll ever
meet,'' she said. ``This experience has been fantastic, awesome.
It's a physics teacher's dream to have this many giants in physics
assembled in one room, and have lunch with them.''

ON THIS POLICE EXAM, THE ENTIRE FORCE IS TESTED  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By DAVID M. HALBFINGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRENTWOOD, N.Y. _ Lyndon Santiago almost didn't sign up for this
year's Suffolk County police test. He sat for the last exam in
1996, dug down for the $50 fee and got his hopes up, and then the
whole test was thrown out because of a cheating scandal.
</P>
<P>
   This year, Santiago thought long before registering again. He
has been trying to become a police officer for five years, and he
knows he would make a good one. But the fee for the test has been
raised to $100 _ the most for a civil service exam in the state,
and no small amount for a 25-year-old courier with a wife and
daughter. Most of his friends who wanted to become officers have
since given up or found jobs in other departments.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he kept thinking about the pay, among the nation's
highest. Suffolk police officers earn $70,659 after five years on
the force. ``You can have a real career with that kind of money,''
Santiago said. ``Right now, I have a job.''
</P>
<P>
   So, two months from now, Santiago and thousands of would-be
officers from all over the New York area will crowd into classrooms
and gymnasiums from Huntington to the Hamptons for the test.
Hundreds of men and women are paying as much as $320 for
preparatory courses offered in New York City and on Long Island.
</P>
<P>
   Santiago, who was born in Puerto Rico and lives in Central
Islip, is one of about 60 Latinos, blacks, Asian-Americans and
immigrants who began a free eight-week prep course Saturday at the
Brentwood Presbyterian Church.
</P>
<P>
   If the applicants are nervous, they are not alone. For the
Suffolk Police Department, the stakes have never been higher.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, widespread cheating defeated what police officials said
had been the department's best effort yet to comply with a
longstanding federal court order to increase the number of blacks,
Hispanics and women in its overwhelmingly white male ranks. Largely
as a result, the officials say, there still are 62 black officers _
just three more than in 1990. The 2,661-person force is still more
than 80 percent white male.
</P>
<P>
   Police Commissioner John C. Gallagher is eager to send 100 new
recruits to the academy to replace those who have left. As many as
800 more officers will be eligible to retire next year, he said.
But if the results of this year's test prove unfair to minorities,
the Justice Department could bring the department back to court for
violating the terms of a 1986 consent degree.
</P>
<P>
   With the deadline for applications approaching on Thursday, the
number of registrants for the police test is about half what it was
at the same time in 1996. Even worse, officials said, the
percentage who are black is down considerably.
</P>
<P>
   Gallagher said the drop in minority applicants was frustrating,
but he could not explain it. ``This is a very attractive job,'' he
said. ``And we make, I think, heroic efforts to reach out,
especially to African-American candidates.''
</P>
<P>
   He noted that Suffolk recruiters visit the traditionally black
colleges in the South, military bases, and hundreds of colleges
throughout the Northeast. On Friday, a recruiter was handing out
fliers in Pennsylvania Station. Recruiters have been visiting
schools and subway stations in the Bronx, Brooklyn and Queens
repeatedly in recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone is mystified by this year's drop in minority
applicants, however. ``It doesn't take anything more than common
sense to tell you that doubling the fee is going to
disproportionately exclude African-Americans and Latinos,'' said
Joe Morris, an organizer for Long Island Congregations,
Associations and Neighborhoods, a church-based advocacy group that
is sponsoring the Brentwood preparatory course along with the John
Jay College of Criminal Justice.
</P>
<P>
   In a much debated moved, the Suffolk Legislature raised the fee
to cover the costs of the exam, which are expected to exceed $1
million.
</P>
<P>
   It is unclear how helpful any of the preparatory courses will
be; instructors know little about the actual test, which has been
revised since 1996. The earlier test was aimed at addressing a
problem identified by the Justice Department in dozens of police
civil-service examinations across the country in the 1970s and
1980s: When only cognitive skills were tested _ things like memory,
spatial relations, and language ability _ minorities scored sharply
lower than whites.
</P>
<P>
   So, beginning with the 1988 test, applicants were also asked to
describe themselves, in the hopes of identifying those with the
traits needed to become successful police officers. Adding such
``biographical'' questions to the mix was supposed to reduce the
gap in scores between whites and minorities.
</P>
<P>
   But those questions _ such as ``At what age did you learn to
swim?'' and ``How many of your relatives work in law enforcement?''
_ seemed irrelevant to many candidates and Suffolk officials. So
much so, in fact, that county legislators approved a resolution
blocking the use of biographical questions in the coming exam, set
for May 22. A veto from County Executive Gaffney is expected,
however.
</P>
<P>
   The 1996 cheating scandal, which resulted in the indictment of
one officer and suspensions for 38 others, prompted the department
to hire a new testing company. Rick R. Jacobs, a partner in the
Pennsylvania firm that is designing this year's test, promised that
the new exam's questions would not seem so bizarre.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our questions will look like they belong on the police test,''
he said, offering little more in the way of detail. ``They'll tap
into what they're supposed to.''
</P>
<P>
   One common concern among blacks and Latinos is that, no matter
how fair the questions, the right answers will have been determined
by interviews with white Suffolk police officers. But Jacobs said
he was careful to interview a disproportionately high number of
black and Latino officers. ``We're as interested as they are in
having a diversified work force,'' he said.

BARKING ERUPTS AT SILENT RALLY TO SAVE CITY'S LARGEST DOG RUN  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By KATHERINE E. FINKELSTEIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ With complaints of noise threatening the future of
the city's largest dog run, more than 30 dog owners and their pets
turned out at Theodore Roosevelt Park here Saturday to protest
quietly and show how well-behaved their dogs could be.
</P>
<P>
   But despite coaching from a dog behaviorist, the efforts of a
noise-reduction subcommittee and signs urging silence, barking
broke out at Teddy's Dog Run on the north side of the Museum of
Natural History.
</P>
<P>
   Mickey, a muddy sheepdog, yelped when a Labrador retriever eyed
the Nerf football clenched in his jaws. Despite frantic shushing
from owners, the dogs noisily greeted a neighbor known for
distributing snacks.
</P>
<P>
   The howling seemed only to heighten the tension between the dog
owners and the residents on 81st Street.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a constant barking sound which explodes at least once
an hour into snarling and yelping,'' said Jack Flam as he glared at
the dog run from his sixth-floor apartment.
</P>
<P>
   The battle over the dog run has pitted a community board and a
block association against the dog owners, who have formed their own
group, Friends of Museum Park Dog Run. It started when the Parks
Department began a multimillion-dollar effort to restore and
landscape the museum's grounds and in the process, upgrade the dog
run.
</P>
<P>
   The run is now a 13,000 square-foot dust pit surrounded by
chicken wire. The plan calls for the run to be moved closer to the
museum wall, to be filled in with pea gravel and to be surrounded
by shrubbery to muffle sound.
</P>
<P>
   But the 81st Street Block Association said that the barking
would reverberate against the museum wall, making it even louder,
and that the dogs would muck up a cultural gem.
</P>
<P>
   The association made an alternate proposal to move the dog run
to 77th Street and Central Park West, and offered the Parks
Department $150,000 to relocate it. On Feb. 12, it submitted the
proposal to Community Board 7.
</P>
<P>
   On March 2, the community board voted to hold off on approving
the plan to upgrade the existing dog run. The dog owners countered
with a resolution to save the original run but to strictly enforce
rules against houndish behavior.
</P>
<P>
   The community board is to vote on whether to approve the Parks
Department's dog run plan on April 6, so the dogs turned out
Saturday to parade their manners. But Flam, a member of the block
association and the community board, was far from satisfied. ``We
are one block away from Central Park, the largest park in the
city,'' he said. ``Why does anyone have to come over here and bark
under our windows?''
</P>
<P>
   It makes sense to have the dog run next to the museum, said
Michael Pennachias, the sheepdog owner who is heading the group's
public relations effort. ``Dogs have been a part of natural history
for thousands of years,'' he pointed out.

EDITORIAL: REINVENTING AL GORE 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Sunday, March 21:
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore has been one of the most active vice presidents in U.S.
history, a central player in an administration that continues to
get high approval ratings. Yet those same polls show that the
public is ambivalent about a Gore presidency.
</P>
<P>
   That may be unsettling to Gore, but he is hardly the first vice
president to face the problem of stepping out of the shadows.
Indeed, his problem is less formidable than that faced by George
Bush. In 1988, Bush had to offer himself as a substitute for the
American family's revered, if somewhat dotty father figure. Gore
has only to supplant the overindulged naughty brother.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Gore will have to offer more than an exaggerated rural
boyhood, a resume and an aura of entitlement if he is to win in his
own right.
</P>
<P>
   On paper, Gore seems better positioned for the race than most
vice presidents. The insider books from this administration make it
clear that Gore has filled the role Clinton promised him, as one of
the president's most important advisers. One of Gore's signature
issues, the environment, is moving toward the center of the
national agenda. He is positively identified with new technology,
despite his grandiose claim about ``creating the Internet.'' As for
reinventing government, his orations put listeners into a cryogenic
trance, but they lock in the New Democrat wonk vote.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, on the matter of presidential dignity, where Clinton
has managed to replace Warren G. Harding as the century's most
notable underachiever, Gore practically radiates assurance of a
dull private life. Unlike most politicians his age _ including
George W. Bush _ he saw overseas duty in the armed forces during
the Vietnam War.
</P>
<P>
   For all that, Gore faces formidable problems. One assumes his
ability to sound as if he is talking down to slightly dull third
graders has defied the arts of Washington's finest speech coaches.
If he lacks the deficits of the bad Bill Clinton, he also lacks the
feel-your-pain skills of the good Clinton. Clinton's preternatural
empathy with whoever was in front of him gave him an enormous
advantage in the kind of campaigning that stresses staged
give-and-take with ``regular Americans.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore cannot turn himself into a Clinton-esque campaigner. But he
has to find a way to show that he has not been permanently tainted
by the situational ethics of this administration's fund-raising.
When the presidential race really begins, the public is bound to
see a lot of Republican ads showing film clips of Gore's Buddhist
temple visit and his richly imagined account of his work there.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president would be smart to separate himself, early on,
from the Clinton campaign-finance legacy. He should assert that the
standard for his fund-raising will be something stricter than
whatever a pliant attorney general will allow. Gore needs to speak
candidly about what went wrong with the administration's
fund-raising operation in 1996 and how he will avoid Clinton's
mistakes in trading access for contributions and in taking suspect
foreign contributions.
</P>
<P>
   Polls also indicate that voters do not regard Gore as a strong
leader. Somewhat surprisingly, foreign policy may provide an
opportunity for him to sketch a distinctive vision during the
campaign. Despite his worthy diplomatic successes in Northern
Ireland and the Middle East, Clinton may leave some gaps in his
international-relations legacy. He has fumbled relations with
China, has not done enough to look ahead to the next generation of
leadership in Russia and has hesitated about breaking out of the
Cold War with Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   As luck would have it, Gore finds himself in a position to punch
up the lagging administration effort to cut the number of Russian
and U.S. nuclear weapons left over from the era of mutually assured
destruction. It is a subject Gore knows well, since as vice
president he chairs twice-a-year meetings with the Russian prime
minister. One of those meetings is scheduled to take place this
week. If Gore can get the drive toward nuclear weapons reduction
back on track, it might do a lot to impress the American people
with his leadership skills.

EDITORIAL: THE NORTH KOREAN THREAT  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Sunday, March 21: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration has defused a dangerous crisis by
persuading North Korea to permit unlimited American inspections of
a suspicious construction site. Washington feared the area was
being readied for secret nuclear weapons work. But the inspection
agreement leaves many problems unresolved, including the future of
North Korea's provocative long-range missile program.
</P>
<P>
   North Korea seems to be running an international extortion
racket, trying to trade in threatening weapons programs for food,
cash and other forms of assistance. Even worse, it may hope to
continue secretly developing these weapons, with which it could
threaten South Korea, Japan and the United States in a future
crisis. America needs to change the nature of the bargaining by
developing a more comprehensive approach.
</P>
<P>
   Washington's 1994 agreement with Pyongyang has frozen North
Korean nuclear weapons development for nearly five years. But it
also has encouraged the North to seek new rewards in exchange for
restraining its missile program and for allowing inspections of the
new construction site. In the latest agreement, the administration
rightly rejected calls for large cash payments and agreed instead
to a modest increase in food aid. Private American groups will also
help the North increase its potato crop.
</P>
<P>
   Talks on the missile issue resume March 29 and American
negotiators should make clear that Washington does not want another
one-issue deal. Congress and the administration are understandably
frustrated with North Korea's seemingly unending series of threats
and demands. To break out of this pattern, the White House last
fall asked William Perry, the former defense secretary, to review
American policy on North Korea. His recommendations are expected
next month.
</P>
<P>
   The administration should offer North Korea a plan to reduce
tensions between the two countries. The administration should make
clear that it would be willing to ease economic sanctions and move
toward diplomatic recognition. In return, Washington should insist
that North Korea make a verifiable commitment to cease all
dangerous weapons production and sales.

CHALLENGERS FOR THE AMERICA'S CUP ARE CLOSELY GUARDING THEIR
SECRETS
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By BARBARA LLOYD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWPORT, R.I. _ It would seem that security at a boat yard would
not be much of a concern. But America's Cup fever has been known to
force competitors to search each other's garbage for clues on boat
design. So with the start of the next cup races less than seven
months away, no one is taking chances.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have curtains inside the door of the boat shed, and the
whole bit,'' Turtle Telfeyan, the general manager of Eric Goetz
Custom Sailboats in Bristol, R.I., said recently. ``We're careful
with all our staff. But we're not guarding against ourselves, the
way we had to do in 1995 when we were building boats for two
different syndicates. We're guarding against all the others.''
</P>
<P>
   The Goetz yard, of course, has something to hide. It has a
contract with the Young America syndicate to build both of the New
York Yacht Club's new 70-foot sailboats for the America's Cup
challengers' trials this autumn.
</P>
<P>
   New York's first new boat is expected to be finished in June,
and the second, which has not been started yet, is apt to take
another five months to build. Both are designed by Bruce Farr &AMP;
Associates, the race-boat firm in Annapolis, Md.
</P>
<P>
   South of Bristol, also in Rhode Island, the new cup contender
for Dennis Conner's Stars &AMP; Stripes syndicate is under
construction. It was designed by Reichel/Pugh, a naval
architectural firm in San Diego. David MacBain, a partner in the
boat-building company, has imposed similar security measures on his
waterfront site in Portsmouth.
</P>
<P>
   Workers have to slip a card into a key slot to get inside the
boat shed. Visitors are not allowed. And employees are required to
sign a document that promises they will not discuss their client's
boat design with anyone else.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have confidentiality agreements now even with non-America's
Cup boats,'' MacBain said. ``With a new keel, or any type of design
that is on the cutting edge of racing, you have to sign off on the
blueprints.''
</P>
<P>
   The pressure from owners has increased in the last decade as
prices soar for hybrid yachts built with space-age materials. The
America's Cup sailboats are constructed of carbon fiber, a
composite resin material that is twice as expensive as fiberglass,
a more conventional hull material.
</P>
<P>
   The boat yards buy 300-foot rolls of carbon fiber that are
already impregnated with resin. The resin acts like glue to
sandwich a honeycomb core between two layers of carbon fiber skin.
Builders of an America's Cup yacht might go through as many as 70
of the carbon fiber rolls _ at $800 a pop _ to complete a hull.
</P>
<P>
   Once the layers of resin cloth and core are laid by hand onto a
giant mold, the whole boat is slid into a room-size oven.
Temperatures of more than 200 degrees bake the material so that it
cures into a stiff, but lightweight, hull form.
</P>
<P>
   Upside down, like a beached whale, the ungainly hull is then
rock-hard and ready for its finishing touches _ an interior, decks,
rigging and hardware. Once in the water, it is a $3 million yacht
designed to withstand the tremendous rigging loads that fully
powered sails impose on an International America's Cup Class race
boat.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the 15 international challenge teams have already
designed their new boats, and a handful have started construction.
But the clock is ticking. The boats need to be shipped to Auckland,
New Zealand, for the Oct. 18 start of the Louis Vuitton Challengers
Series.
</P>
<P>
   New Zealand's defense team is not under the same time
constraints. It plans no in-house trials, just testing. As the
America's Cup defender, a title the small Southern Hemisphere
community won in 1995 by defeating Conner's Stars &AMP; Stripes team,
New Zealand can build its new boat as late as it wants. The cup
match itself is scheduled to begin Feb. 19.
</P>
<P>
   That also means New Zealand could gain from any inside knowledge
of its opponents. ``It would do them a lot of good to see what each
challenge boat looks like,'' Telfeyan said. &QL;

REAL ESTATE: NEW JERSEY HELPS DEVELOPERS RECYCLE POLLUTED AREAS 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By RACHELLE GARBARINE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Todd L. Normane calls the more flexible way the state works with
developers to recycle polluted industrial sites ``more like a
handshake than a hammer.''
</P>
<P>
   For the process includes a new financial incentive _
reimbursement for up to 75 percent of the cleanup cost.
</P>
<P>
   Normane _ a lawyer at Maraziti, Falcon &AMP; Healy, a Short Hills,
N.J., firm that specializes in environmental and redevelopment law
_ is representing Arc Properties of Clifton, N.J., whose project is
the first approved for the reimbursement under the 1998 Brownfields
and Contaminated Sites Redemption Act.
</P>
<P>
   A draft of the redevelopment agreement setting the terms of the
reimbursement was completed earlier this month and the state and
the developer are expected to sign an accord by the end of the
month, Normane said.
</P>
<P>
   Arc is cleaning up the contaminants from a 30-acre site at the
intersection of Routes 1 and 287 in the south-central portion of
Edison Township in Middlesex County. At the same time, it is razing
four interconnecting industrial buildings formerly occupied by a
steel tubing manufacturer, which filed for bankruptcy in 1995, to
make way for a 285,000-square-foot shopping center called Edison
Crossroads.
</P>
<P>
   The cost of the cleanup, plans for which have been approved by
the state's Department of Environmental Protection, is estimated at
$1.5 million; 75 percent of it, or $1.2 million, is expected to be
returned to Arc under the reimbursement program, said Normane.
</P>
<P>
   Eight tenants have signed on for all of the space at the
project, which will cost a total of $25 million to develop.
</P>
<P>
   Among them are Home Depot, taking 138,000 square feet; Edwards
Super Food Store, with 57,000 square feet; Worldwide Floor
Coverings, 40,000 square feet, and Office Depot, 27,500 square
feet. Completion is scheduled for early next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The risk is always great in such redevelopment projects,''
Normane said, ``but the reimbursement incentive helps to level the
playing field and add a little more reward to the risk.''
</P>
<P>
   The 1998 brownfields act is the latest in a series of steps New
Jersey has taken in recent years to facilitate the reuse of the
10,000 contaminated sites in the state, down from about 20,000 in
1985, that are the legacy of its industrial past. Of the remaining
sites, about 1,130 are so-called brownfields _ which the state
defines as former commercial or industrial sites that are
underutilized or abandoned and contain known or perceived
contaminants _ that are being cleaned and redeveloped.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the reimbursement, the act provides purchasers of
tainted sites protection from private lawsuits related to past
contamination problems and carries an assurance that the state will
not sue once the site is cleaned according to its standards.
</P>
<P>
   To qualify for the reimbursement, developers must, among other
things, demonstrate that they were not the polluter, that their
projects are economically feasible and that they will create jobs
and fit with local, regional and state planning objectives.
</P>
<P>
   The most important condition is that the projects must generate
new tax revenue that exceeds the cost of the cleanup. The state
uses projections of eight different state taxes, from sales to use
and corporate taxes, to calculate a project's revenue. Developers
must clean the site in accordance with a plan approved by the
state's Department of Environmental Protection and enter a
redevelopment agreement with the state approved by the Commerce &AMP;
Economic Growth Commission and the state treasurer.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement specifies the amount of the reimbursement and the
frequency and duration of the payments. The latter is directly tied
to the occupancy rate of the project.
</P>
<P>
   ``The aim is to entice developers to take a second look at
abandoned and tainted properties that are not now producing revenue
and get them back on the tax rolls,'' said Kelly A. Woods, deputy
director of the Office of Urban Programs, within New Jersey's
Commerce &AMP; Economic Growth Commission, which administers the
reimbursement program.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's also a revenue neutral program for the state,'' said Ms.
Woods, explaining that _ rather than go into the state treasury _
the taxes collected from qualified projects go into a special
reimbursement fund and are filtered back to the project's
developer. Thus, if revenue does not come into the state from the
redevelopment project ``the developer does not receive a penny,''
she noted.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the Edison project, applications for four others are in
various stages of the review process and there have been
pre-application meetings with developers for 13 more.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The success of the first project will be key, she added, because
it will send the message that ``the program does work.''
</P>
<P>
   Arc became involved with the Edison project in 1995 when it
secured approvals from the Federal Bankruptcy Court in Manhattan to
buy the 30-acre tract. It closed the transaction last June. ``The
whole attraction to the site was its location,'' said Marc A.
Perel, executive vice president at Arc.
</P>
<P>
   He said that, along with being visible from and accessible to
two major highways, the property was close to two regional malls
and in a neighborhood of Edison that has been changing from
industrial to retail use.
</P>
<P>
   Contaminants on the site and in the groundwater include
petroleum hydrocarbons and chemical solvent left behind from
industrial users. ``Though there may be easier sites to develop,''
Perel said, ``ones of this size with this kind of location are
difficult to find.''
</P>
<P>
   The former owner _ Berger Industries, the steel-tubing
manufacturer _ had operated on the site for 14 years before it shut
down in 1993, two years before filing for bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years other smaller companies also operated on part of
the site, including a fragrance manufacturer. In recent years,
sections of the 360,000-square-foot industrial complex Berger
Industries once occupied were subleased to a collection of retail
and commercial tenants. But after Arc invested two years and over
$1 million in the project Perel said it became apparent the
magnitude of the cleanup was greater than expected. The company
sought the reimbursement incentive last March soon after the state
made it available.
</P>
<P>
   ``It became important to mitigate the cost overruns we didn't
anticipate, making the project much more economically feasible,''
Perel said.
</P>
<P>
   Under the cleanup plan, high levels of pollutants on portions of
the property will be removed and carted off the site. Areas with
low levels will be capped with an impervious surface.
</P>
<P>
   What helped in pursuing the reimbursement incentive, said
Normane, the lawyer, is that the Edison Crossroads redevelopment
had all its approvals in place and tenants lined up, showing the
viability of the project. In turn, he said, it will generate $4.5
million a year in sales taxes alone, which is $3 million more than
needed to cover the cost to clean the property. He added that the
property, when redeveloped, would create 800 jobs and rise in value
to $31 million from $8 million.
</P>
<P>
   Terri Smith, a legislative analyst at the Site Remediation
Program, part of the state's Department of Environmental
Protection, said Edison Crossroads ``was a perfect match'' for the
reimbursement program and a good project for the state to support
``because everyone involved stands to benefit.''
</P>
<P>
   Perel said the area's demographics also supported the project,
which with its open-air design and collection of so-called big-box
retailers, will be a ``power center.'' He said some 280,000 people
with an average household income of $69,000 live within a five-mile
radius of the site.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Brunelli, who heads a retail brokerage in Old Bridge
bearing his name, said the vacancy rate in strip centers and
free-standing stores along the entire 30-mile Route 1 retail
corridor _ where Edison Crossroads is situated _ had dropped to 6.3
percent by the end of 1998 from 7.7 percent a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is demand in the Woodbridge-Edison trade area for
another power center and for another half million square feet of
space beyond that,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   (The International Council of Shopping Centers in Manhattan
defines a power center as an open-air retail strip with 250,000 to
750,000 square feet of space and three or more big-box retailers.)
</P>
<P>
   Brunelli added that with today's strong economy and real estate
market developers across the state are tearing down old industrial
complexes and replacing them with new uses.
</P>
<P>
   ``But often,'' he added, ``the difference is making such
projects economically feasible or not is the cost of the cleanup.''

 REAL ESTATE: RESTORING AN AGING BATHTUB  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By JAY ROMANO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ When a shirt gets stained and yellow you retire it
and when a carpet gets worn and shabby, you toss it out and get a
new one.
</P>
<P>
   But what do you do when the above conditions apply to an
800-pound hunk of porcelain in your bathroom?
</P>
<P>
   ``Did you ever try to get a bathtub into an elevator?'' said
Richard Toder, executive director of T/S Associates, a
mechanical-systems consulting company in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Toder, a licensed plumber who has waltzed more than a few tubs
out of tight corners, said that in addition to the logistical
difficulties involved in hauling a cast-iron clunker out of a house
or an apartment, replacing an existing fixture can also result in
unexpected expenses when floor or wall tiles are disturbed or
broken or when a fragile old plumbing system must be replaced and
brought up to code.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, he said, it is becoming increasingly common for
home and apartment owners to make the best of what they already
have by restoring aging fixtures in place. With coating materials
and methods for applying them steadily improving, Toder said, there
are now several cost-effective techniques available for
refinishing, refacing, relining and generally rejuvenating
deteriorating fixtures.
</P>
<P>
   ``If your tub holds water,'' he said, ``restoration is probably
the way to go.''
</P>
<P>
   Homeowners can generally make at least a marginal improvement in
the appearance of their fixtures by applying epoxy-based coatings
sold in most home centers, But generally speaking, he said, the
quality of the appearance of such finishes is dependent entirely on
the skill of the amateur craftsman.
</P>
<P>
   An alternative, of course, is to hire a professional and get the
job done right.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do bathtubs, wall tiles, floor tiles, sinks and even
toilets,'' said Francine Tumolo, an owner of Perma Ceram
Enterprises, a Smithtown, N.Y., company that manufactures and
distributes a ``synthetic porcelain'' reglazing product.
</P>
<P>
   In most cases, she said, a bathtub can be reglazed with Perma
Ceram in three or four hours and will be dry enough to use in 12.
``To do a tub runs anywhere from $250 to $300,'' she said. ``That
comes with a five-year guarantee and a 15-year life expectancy.''
Ms. Tumolo said that her company could also reglaze ceramic-tile
tub enclosures. ``When we do tile, we spray right over the grout
lines and seal them,'' she said. ``That means no more scraping
mildew with a toothbrush.''
</P>
<P>
   John Fred, president of Perma-Glaze Remodeling in Deer Park,
N.Y., said that the finish material he uses is a polymer resin that
provides the ``look and feel of porcelain'' when it cures. In most
cases, Fred said, the first step in refinishing a bathtub or sink
is to clean the fixture thoroughly, remove any existing rust or
caulking materials, and fill any cracks or chips. Then, he said,
the surface is ``etched'' with an acid wash to make it slightly
porous, and primed with a rust-inhibiting primer.
</P>
<P>
   The top coat of Perma-Glaze is then sprayed on, Fred said, and
takes about 48 hours to fully cure. ``We can accelerate the drying
time with a heat lamp,'' he said, adding that in most cases, the
Perma-Glaze top coat can be custom-matched to any color used by
American Standard or Kohler, two large bath-fixture manufacturers.
Perma-Glaze will also refinish wall tiles, Fred said, adding that
the cost runs from $5 to $7 a square foot.
</P>
<P>
   Donna Brennan, an owner of Worldwide Refinishing Systems in
Ringwood, N.J., said that her company used a urethane-based finish
originally developed for the aerospace industry. ``We always use
three coats,'' she said, adding that the finish material is sprayed
on top of a special bonding solution applied after the surface is
cleaned and etched. Ms. Brennan pointed out that since three finish
coats are used, it is possible to completely change the color of
the fixture being refinished.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've gone from hot-pink and black to all-avocado,'' she said.
``And we have matching acrylic coatings that can be used to make
any wood in the room match the fixtures.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Brennan said that homeowners should make sure that their
refinishing contractor provides adequate ventilation of the
potentially dangerous fumes that may result from the refinishing
process.
</P>
<P>
   ``We use a filtered system that uses flexible tubing to vent
fumes from the bathroom to the outside,'' she said. She cautioned
that while mounting an exhaust fan in the bathroom window might
remove fumes, it was also more likely to draw dust particles from
other areas of the house and then deposit them in the finish coat
on the fixture.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Brennan pointed out that, aside from the quality of the
refinishing material used, the most significant determinant of the
longevity of the restoration is the manner in which it is cleaned.
``You should never scrub,'' she said. ``And you should always use a
nonabrasive cleaner.''
</P>
<P>
   For those who want a more durable finish than can be obtained by
re-glazing, Ms. Brennan said, relining may be the answer. ``Our tub
liners start at around $700,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   With a tub liner, the existing tub is encased in the liner.
</P>
<P>
   Linda Brakel, vice president of franchise operations for Bath
Fitter, a liner manufacturer in South Burlington, Vt., said that
her company could manufacture one-piece, quarter-inch-thick liners
that are custom-tailored to fit each customer's tub.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have literally hundreds of molds,'' Ms. Brakel said.
</P>
<P>
   The liners, she said, utilize existing plumbing connections and
faucets and are typically indistinguishable from stand-alone
bathtubs. To complete the custom-made appearance, Ms. Brakel said,
Bath Fitter franchisees can also install matching one-piece tub
surrounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's completely seamless all around and from tub to ceiling,''
she said, adding that a typical tub-and-wall installation could run
anywhere from $1,500 to $1,800. And though it may take a week or
two after measurements are taken for the franchisee to install the
unit, the actual installation can usually be completed in an
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Notwithstanding similar installation-time claims by nearly all
re-finishers and reliners, Ms. Tumolo of Perma Ceram in Smithtown
offered one final bit of advice applicable to all homeowners
contemplating face-lifts for their bathtubs. ``Bathe before we get
there,'' she said.

EDITORIAL OBSERVER: IS NEW HAMPSHIRE RIPE FOR GOV. WHOSIT? 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By GAIL COLLINS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an Editorial Observer on Sunday,
March 21:
</P>
<P>
   Let me summarize George Pataki's problem this way. While I was
in Manchester, N.H., for Pataki's big debut as a potential
Republican presidential candidate at a Lincoln Day dinner, I got
into an argument with a cab driver who insisted that the governor
of New York is Rudy Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
   ``And he's been here already,'' the driver concluded, satisfied.
</P>
<P>
   Since Pataki's big selling point is all the things he has
accomplished as governor, this is the sort of confusion that could
present a serious drawback. Still, he seemed extremely pleased by
the welcome he received in New Hampshire, where he was front-page
news in the local papers, one of which referred to him as ``the
Dennis Rodman of potential Republican candidates.'' ( Pataki is
very tall, but the point was that both men have vague career
plans.)
</P>
<P>
   This was much better treatment than Pataki gets in New York,
where journalists generally do not regard him as colorful enough to
compare with anybody.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are you running?'' asked a Manchester television interviewer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tom, what I'm trying to do is make sure my party has a
positive agenda for change,'' said Pataki, in a mantra he repeated
over and over for two days.
</P>
<P>
   Of course he is running, or at least running around, and
``testing the waters,'' as the candidates like to say. Many people
may wonder why. Sure, Republican governors are all the rage this
year, but there are 31 of them, including the Big Kahuna in Texas.
Pataki does not have much name recognition, even among people as
sophisticated about Republican presidential candidates as New
Hampshire cab drivers. He has no organization, and he is infamous
in New York as a terrible public speaker. Among his own
constituents, there may be fewer people wondering whether Pataki
can win the Republican presidential nomination than people
speculating whether he has taken leave of his senses.
</P>
<P>
   The governor's quest may be improbable, but it is not crazy. If
Pataki did jump into the Republican race, he would be the only
pro-choice candidate in a field of about 12. Abortion rights are
not generally a cause that gets you very far in Republican
primaries, but a sizable minority of the Republicans in New
Hampshire are pro-choice, including the state chairman. The round
of primaries after New Hampshire's includes Pataki's home state and
California, where many Republicans believe they lost the
governorship on the abortion issue and are eager to avoid that trap
again.
</P>
<P>
   The current Republican talent pool is large but shallow. George
W. Bush is still something of an unknown quantity. Elizabeth Dole's
candidacy has sparked enormous enthusiasm for the idea of a woman
presidential candidate, but very little for the idea of Elizabeth
Dole. No one else in the pack has shown any signs of catching fire.
If Bush turns out to be less overwhelming a candidate than
everybody imagines, perhaps Pataki could get respectable showings
in a crowded field. His tax-cutting credentials are arguably even
more pristine than those of Bush, whose early unsuccessful effort
at reforming Texas' tax structure involved raising the sales tax.
</P>
<P>
   On the road, Pataki's speeches are better than the labored
productions he delivers in Albany. The governor has terrible
eyesight, which makes it hard for him to handle a teleprompter and
adds to the plodding, high-school-valedictorian quality of his
delivery. But he gives his stump speech without notes, and he
sounds more down to earth and appealing. His theme is that
Democrats have been good at pre-empting Republican themes like
fiscal discipline and individual responsibility. But only
Republicans (well, really only Republican governors) can carry
through after the election is over. The speech is laced with
constant references to the evils of big Washington bureaucracy and
``elites.'' Pataki, a Yale-educated former Manhattan lawyer, has
absolutely nothing good to say about ``elites.''
</P>
<P>
   The defining characteristic of Pataki's political career has
been his eagerness to move up _ a rare quality in New York, where
politics is about finding a safe nest and staying there forever. He
has always gotten restless quickly, and run for the next-highest
job, even if it meant taking a risk. He has now climbed so far that
the next rung is almost ridiculously far above his head. But Pataki
has been governor for more than four years now, and even though he
keeps his home elsewhere, that's a long time to spend in Albany. If
he gets into the presidential race, he will probably get mentioned
as a possible vice-presidential choice or Cabinet appointee. At
minimum the drivers in Manchester will learn that the governor of
New York is not named Rudy.

FROM LAWYER TO MISSING MAN TO FUGITIVE  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (SUBS for new top)   By MIKE ALLEN    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MARLBOROUGH, Conn. _ A hard rain was tailing off about noon on
March 1 when F. Mac Buckley, a burly cigar smoker who was one of
Connecticut's best-known criminal-defense lawyers, pulled out of
the driveway of his 260-year-old Colonial here in the countryside
southeast of Hartford. He grabbed his cellular phone and called his
Hartford office to say he was headed for Federal court in New
Haven, where he was due at a 2 p.m. hearing for a client charged
with selling cocaine.
</P>
<P>
   The judge and other lawyers waited until 5 p.m. and then gave
up. Buckley had vanished. He is 57 and has a wife and five grown
daughters.
</P>
<P>
   At first, his family and friends said they feared he might have
been done in by a former client or by an enemy of one of the many
gang members and mobsters he had defended over the years. State
police officers in cruisers and a plane scoured the roads and woods
between Marlborough and New Haven, checking ditches and parking
lots for his 1998 teal Lincoln Navigator with a New England
Patriots sticker on the back window.
</P>
<P>
   But Buckley quickly went from missing person to wanted man.
</P>
<P>
   As clients got over the shock of his disappearance and checked
their accounts, they began accusing him of absconding with hundreds
of thousands of dollars he had held in trust for them.
</P>
<P>
   Warrants were issued charging him with forgery and embezzlement,
and this week he was declared a federal fugitive. Investigators
said they plan to seek a warrant to seize his financial records in
the next few days, and expect more charges.
</P>
<P>
   Relations have soured between investigators and Buckley's
family. A senior state official said relatives did not report him
missing for 30 hours, and even then they made the report only after
the police had heard about the disappearance from other lawyers and
went to the Buckley home to investigate.
</P>
<P>
   Now, many of those who were taken in by Buckley's gregarious
machismo say they should have seen trouble looming. The requests
for fees in advance, the secretiveness, the blithe disregard for
phone messages had all made Dennis B. Messenger wonder about
Buckley, who was representing Messenger's brother on a murder
charge.
</P>
<P>
   But then the two met for sole and lobster at the Chowder Pot IV
restaurant in Hartford, where Buckley poured out tales of his years
of freeing mobsters, moonlighting as a boxing trainer and promoter,
and dabbling in politics. He barely paused to chew as he told how
he had worked his way through college and law school, then gotten
his start as a Federal drug prosecutor.
</P>
<P>
   This was the full Mac Buckley treatment _ an entrancing rap he
had honed with juries and unleashed on ESPN as a commentator during
the O.J. Simpson trial. Messenger said that Buckley went on to
boast about his estate here in Marlborough, then confided that he
loved his work so much that he would never retire.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wasn't conventional, but I could see he was powerful in the
state and knew how to work the system,'' Messenger recalls
thinking. ``It obviously worked for him, and it had for quite
awhile.''
</P>
<P>
   Messenger picked up the check.
</P>
<P>
   The country ``estate'' turns out to be just a house _ the
adjoining 50-acre farm was sold off four years ago, although
Buckley still sometimes gave ``Buck Hill Farm'' as his address. The
house was put in the name of Buckley's wife, Donna, in 1990, and
she is the registered owner of all three of their cars.
</P>
<P>
   The message to his law office about him heading to New Haven may
have been a diversion. Investigators say that shortly after Buckley
headed out, a signal was detected from his cellular phone _ which
was briefly switched on, although he was not making calls _ near
Albany, just off Interstate 90.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators say they have one other clue.
</P>
<P>
   Late in the afternoon on March 5, a man approached a caretaker
at St. Agnes Cemetery in Menands, N.Y., just outside Albany, and
asked to be directed to the grave of Buckley's father. Later, the
caretaker was shown Buckley's photo, and he said he was certain
that Buckley was the curious visitor he had helped.
</P>
<P>
   But such was Buckley's mystique that many of his neighbors and
associates refuse to believe that he disappeared intentionally. In
the courthouses and law offices of Connecticut, the tales have
grown increasingly wild: that he has joined the federal
witness-protection program, that he has enlisted in the Irish
Republican Army, that he is on a gambling spree in Canada.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, his clients are left with no lawyer and, some
of them say, no money. John T. Spellman, an owner of Marlborough
Tavern, where Buckley used booth A-2 as a satellite office for
meeting clients, is left puzzling over what the lawyer told him in
their last conversation. `` `I'm like Frank Sinatra,' '' Spellman
said Buckley said he had told his doctor, spurning advice to give
up cigars and liquor. `` `I've done it my way. I'm not afraid to
die.'''
</P>
<P>
   Friends suspect the image-conscious Buckley would be dismayed to
learn that his ``wanted'' posters identify him as Francis McKeon
Buckley, the name he was given when he was born in New Haven. He
grew up in Scarsdale, N.Y., and graduated from the College of the
Holy Cross in Worcester, Mass., in 1963 and from Georgetown
University Law Center in 1967. He often described himself as ``a
Golden Gloves boxer.''
</P>
<P>
   He clerked for a Connecticut Supreme Court justice, then learned
both sides of the legal trade as an assistant federal prosecutor
and an assistant public defender. He lost when he ran for Congress
as a Republican in 1974, then was elected the next year as a
Councilman in Newington.
</P>
<P>
   At nights and on weekends, he was a boxing trainer and promoter,
and groomed one champion, the welterweight Marlon Starling. He made
friends around inner-city gyms by paying down-and-out fighters to
spar with his boxers. He often took a carload of poor youngsters to
see out-of-town fights.
</P>
<P>
   Buckley was at home with Connecticut society, where he bought a
$3,500 box at January's inaugural ball for Gov. John G. Rowland, as
well as in Hartford's housing projects, where youngsters who knew
him from boxing called him ``Big Daddy Mac.'' (MORE)

 &HT;    BALLOONISTS BREAK RECORD, HEAD FOR LANDING IN EGYPT
 &HT;    650&AMP;add.
 &HT;    By LARRY KAPLOW
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAIRO _ Succeeding in their quest for the first nonstop balloon
flight around the world, a Swiss psychiatrist and British pilot
headed for an early Sunday landing of their high-tech craft in the
ancient sands of Egypt.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am with the angels and just completely happy,'' Bertrand
Piccard said by satellite relay shortly he and partner Brian Jones
conquered one of aviation's last great challenges. ``We are
eternally grateful to the invisible hand that has guided us through
this fantastic voyage.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a trip that matched the highest technologies of aviation
and meteorology against the vagaries of high-altitude winds and
low-level sandstorms.
</P>
<P>
   Nearing its end, it would bring a shimmering vision of
end-of-the millennium adventurism and corporate sponsorship to the
Egyptian deserts, where the first civilizations were born and where
peasants still scrape out a living herding sheep and farming.
</P>
<P>
   Piccard, 41, seemed emblematic of the spirit of the trip. He is
the son of the scientist who set a depth record for ocean descent
in his bathyscaphe submarine and the grandson of the first man to
fly a balloon into the stratosphere.
</P>
<P>
   His partner was Jones, a 51-year-old businessman who gave up his
kitchen wares company to pursue ballooning.
</P>
<P>
   The pair completed their circumnavigation at 4:54 a.m. EST. At
that point, about 34,000 feet over the northwestern nation of
Mauritania, the Breitling Orbiter 3 balloon crossed 9 degrees 27
minutes west longitude, a line it had crossed early in the trip.
</P>
<P>
   The balloon had been afloat for 20 days. It took off March 1
from Chateau-d'Oex in the Swiss Alps, and flew southwest at first
to catch favorable winds.
</P>
<P>
   Their pear-shaped balloon, made in England, is 180 feet tall and
weighs more than nine tons. A combination of hot air and helium
filled the giant silver canopy, heated by propane burners.
</P>
<P>
   The balloon uses state-of-the-art materials _ the capsule is
made of kevlar and carbon _ but remains largely at the mercy of the
elements. It often flew at speeds over 100 mph high in the
stratosphere, where the temperature in the pressurized cabin dipped
below 45 degrees (F).
</P>
<P>
   The pilots changed altitudes throughout the trip, searching for
cooperative jet stream winds. When necessary, they descended far
enough to emerge from their foul-smelling capsule and break away
crusted ice.
</P>
<P>
   Crossing the Americas, Piccard resorted to self-hypnosis to help
ease his nerves. They considered ending the flight after stalling
over the Caribbean, but caught strong winds that quickly took them
across the Atlantic to Africa.
</P>
<P>
   In Geneva, where the trip was monitored at a makeshift center in
the Geneva airport, flight controllers broke open champagne to
celebrate the record journey.
</P>
<P>
   Balloon recovery personnel and media flew to Egypt. The planes
are expected to quickly take the pilots to Geneva.
</P>
<P>
   With more than one day's supply of propane fuel still aboard,
the balloonists said late Saturday they would try to reach the
desert near the Nile river south of Cairo for their dawn landing.
</P>
<P>
   The landing zone shifted throughout the day. Winds near Cairo
scratched a plan to land the craft near the 4,500-year-old pyramids
of the Giza Plateau. Sandstorms, normal for this season,
complicated other landing zones.
</P>
<P>
   By concluding the trip in Egypt, the crew was in the same
country where, in 1981, Maxie Anderson and Don Ida started the
first attempt at a balloon circumnavigation. Its lasted only 48
hours. Fifteen other journeys would be launched, many by a group of
millionaire adventurers that includes British Virgin magnate
Richard Branson and American businessman Steve Fosset.

   The watch company that sponsored the trip refuses to say how
much it has spent, though this is its third attempt and costs are
certainly in the millions of dollars. Company officials vowed the
third try would be last _ succeed or fail.

   Friends of Piccard's, who arrived in Cairo Saturday night to try
to meet his landing, said the trip fulfilled dreams of his and
theirs.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me, it is the last great adventure of the century,'' said
Jean Claude Metille, 45, a Swiss advertising executive who came to
Cairo on a private jet.
</P>
<P>
   ``For us in Switzerland, it is a big subject. It is the same as
the story of (American pilot Charles) Lindbergh. ...The story will
say that, in the 20th century, there was Lindbergh, (Astronaut
Neil) Armstrong and Piccard,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Armelle Sermier, a wife of the media coordinator for the
journey, said the landing would not be just the culmination of a
three-week trip, but a three-year struggle.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a big relief and the result of many sacrifices,'' said
Sermier, 36. Asked if it was worth the work, she answered, ``For
people who like to dream, yes.''

MARLBOROUGH, Conn.: ``Big Daddy Mac.''  
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the courtroom, Buckley used sarcasm, street slang and
disarming frankness to dazzle juries. During his summations in mob
cases, jaded clerks from throughout the courthouse squeezed into
the benches as spectators.
</P>
<P>
   ``He lost it and he shot him,'' Buckley said of one client,
arguing that a murder charge was too serious. He derided a drug
informer's work as ``just a sloppy, slanted job.'' Two bumbling
informers in another case became ``the dynamic duo.''
</P>
<P>
   William F. Dow III, a New Haven lawyer, said Buckley entertained
other lawyers with his undisguised vanity and brash lingo, but
drove them crazy with his sloppy habits. ``He was always late,
always out of contact, no one ever knew how to reach him,'' Dow
said. ``That was always part of the mystery about Mac _ how someone
that difficult to get hold of could be so successful. The answer
was that he was a great lawyer.''
</P>
<P>
   But his habits also prompted a stream of complaints from clients
to the Statewide Grievance Committee, which disciplines lawyers,
and led to a reprimand.
</P>
<P>
   On the day Buckley disappeared, a lawyer for the grievance
committee had recommended that Buckley's law license be suspended
because of the case involving Messenger's brother. The brother,
David, who is awaiting trial on a charge that he murdered his wife,
was a salesman for a scientific instrument company and had assets
of $500,000 to $1 million, relatives say.
</P>
<P>
   In court papers, the grievance committee said Buckley ``induced
David Messenger to provide him a complete power of attorney and may
have dissipated David Messenger's assets.'' Acting on the
complaint, a Superior Court judge suspended Buckley's law license a
week after his disappearance.
</P>
<P>
   The criminal charges against Buckley, which were filed 12 days
after he disappeared, stem from the case of a couple in Hebron,
Conn., who had entrusted to Buckley the $580,000 they received in a
settlement in 1994 after a daughter was killed in a drunken driving
accident. Buckley, in an unusual move for a lawyer, invested the
money for the couple, David and Sharon Fracchia.
</P>
<P>
   In a lawsuit, the couple charged that on Feb. 1, Buckley
converted two of their certificates of deposit into a check for
$144,554, then signed their names on the back and cashed it at a
bank in Malden, Mass. The lawsuit said he had failed to keep them
posted on the state of their account and had repeatedly ignored
their requests for updates. In addition to the missing check, about
$300,000 in investments is unaccounted for, said a lawyer for the
couple, Robert J.T. Britt of Hartford.
</P>
<P>
   Buckley responded with prickly indignation to the string of
formal complaints from clients who said he had ignored them or
missed deadlines.
</P>
<P>
   In the case that drew a reprimand in 1997, involving failure to
release records to a prisoner who wanted to fire him, Buckley wrote
to the grievance committee that the prisoner would have to get
someone to pick the records up.
</P>
<P>
   ``We spent a lot of time and money copying and I don't intend to
finance the shipping,'' Buckley wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Just in the last three months, according to lawyers and court
papers, Buckley had explained his lapses by complaining variously
of back trouble, a cardiac problem and acute sinusitis.
</P>
<P>
   Among those who say Buckley abandoned them is Debbie Brahm, 32,
of Marlborough, who hired him to handle her divorce several years
ago. Ms. Brahm, a mother of two, had met Buckley when she worked at
a convenience store and he came in every morning to buy newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   After taking her case, she said, ``He never returned my calls.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Brahm said she paid Buckley several thousand dollars and
cannot afford to pay another lawyer to pursue the divorce. She is
hoping one of Buckley's daughters, Moira, who was one of his law
partners, will pick up the case, but has begun to worry.
</P>
<P>
   ``She hasn't returned my calls, either,'' Ms. Brahm said.

<P>
   HAITI-FLOPS _ PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti _ The history of U.S. aid in
Haiti is peppered with some pretty big flops. But none is more
notorious than the pig fiasco. It started in the late 1970s, when
the United States found swine fever among pigs in the Dominican
Republic, which shares the same island as Haiti. The U.S. Agency
for International Development came up in 1982 with what sounded
like a good plan to ward off the fever in Haiti: Haiti's 1.3
million Creole pigs were destroyed, and were to be replaced with
American stock better suited for export. (The Creole word for
``pig'' and ``bank'' is the same.) Formerly, poor Haitians could
buy a piglet that could eat garbage and scrub and survive in the
heat with little water. When money was needed for a crisis or a
wedding, the ``bank'' could be cashed in. After AID launched its
program, and the Creole pigs were slaughtered, the average Haitian
couldn't afford to buy American pigs or pay for the
vitamin-enriched feed they needed. The result was that they were
worse off than ever before. (Emling, Cox News Service).

   LONNIEHOLLEY-PART2 _ HARPERSVILLE, Va. _ We look at Holley and
his family and their current troubles. Holley has raised five
children by himself, and by all accounts did a great job against
the odds. But in recent years, his kids have had all manner of
problems. And it could get worse. (Auchmutey, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution) 58.
</P>
<P>
   LONNIEH0LLEY-PART3 _ BIRMINGHAM, Ala. _ We look at Holley's
career in the context of the world of folk art. The reasons for
folk artists' struggles are complicated but the results are the
same: renowned, respected artists who wouldn't qualify for an auto
loan. We also look at the efforts of various dealers and do-gooders
to help him and his family. (Auchmutey, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution) 50.
</P>
<P>
   LONNIEHOLLEY-PART4 _ We sort out the endings, happy and
otherwise. The first good news, it seemed, Holley had gotten in
years was that juvenile authorities had been so impressed with
Holley's 16-year old son Kubra that they took it upon themselves to
nominate him for the Alabama School of Fine Arts, a magnet program
in Birmingham for gifted children from across the state. While
oldest son Ezekial appears headed for prison, and third son A.J.
for juvenile boot camp. And Holley? He'll probably plead guilty to
reduced charges and get probation, and he's finally painting again.

BRUMFIELD MAKES MOST OF CHANCE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. _ The stars and staples of teams try to
survive spring training without incident, gearing up for the
regular season with no huge worries.
</P>
<P>
   It's the fringe players who need to impress, and who can win
jobs. Outfielder Jacob Brumfield, who toiled in Triple-A Charlotte
in the Florida Marlins organization last season, is doing just
that. He's making a push to unseat the injured Trenidad Hubbard as
the Dodgers' fifth outfielder.
</P>
<P>
   While Hubbard is recovering from a thumb and shoulder injury
suffered in a March 8 outfielder collision, Brumfield is getting
playing time and showcasing his speed.
</P>
<P>
   He went 1 for 3 Saturday against the Baltimore Orioles, but
equally as impressive was Brumfield's ability to go from first to
third on a groundout to third baseman Cal Ripken.
</P>
<P>
   ``He can play. He knows how to play,'' manager Davey Johnson
said. ``A lot of the times the question with Jacob is his health.
When he's healthy, he can still play.''
</P>
<P>
   Brumfield said the reason he spent last season in the minors was
a recurring hamstring injury, from which he tried to return too
quickly. But an offseason playing in Venezuela eased his mind in
regards to health.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything is dominated by numbers, and last season I didn't
have them,'' said Brumfield, who's hitting .320 since moving from
the minor-league clubhouse to the Dodgers clubhouse 10 days ago.
``Right now I'm feeling pretty confident (about making the team).
If I'm healthy, I can help anybody. Right now I feel like I'm
pretty healthy.''
</P>
<P>
   Grudzielanek scratched: Johnson's original lineup card had Mark
Grudzielanek starting at shortstop, but that was altered before the
two-hour bus ride south from Dodgertown because Grudzielanek is
suffering from shin splints.
</P>
<P>
   That didn't appear to sit well with Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know shin splints was something that could keep you
out of a game,'' Johnson said. ``Just put your (support) hose on
and play.''
</P>
<P>
   Balks, walks and chalk: Starter Darren Dreifort had his longest
outing of the spring, not allowing a run in four innings. He
yielded three hits but was bothered by the three walks he issued.
In his past two outings, Dreifort has walked eight batters. ``The
results were better (than the last outing), but I still walked too
many,'' Dreifort said. ``I get out of whack mechanically. The guys
I'm walking, I'm just not compensating quick enough.'' . . . Warren
Newson, considered a long shot to make the club as a utility
outfielder, saw his chances diminish even further when he pulled up
lame trying to beat out a grounder in the first inning. ``I felt it
pop in the back of my (right) hamstring,'' Newson said. It could
keep him out of the lineup for more than a week, Johnson said. . .
. Right-hander Dave Mlicki, who hasn't pitched since March 13
because of stiffness near his right shoulder blade, is scheduled to
pitch in a simulated game today. Johnson said Mlicki could pitch in
the regular game, but there may not be enough innings for him to do
so since Kevin Brown is making the start against the Montreal
Expos.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday's recap: Baltimore scored twice in the bottom of the
eighth inning to defeat the Dodgers 3-2 at Fort Lauderdale Stadium.
The winning run scored when right fielder Scott Livingstone
misplayed Danny Clyburn's single, which allowed a run to score from
first base. Reliever Doug Bochtler allowed a hit and walked two in
one inning and took the loss. &QL; 
Today's game: Right-hander Kevin Brown returns to the mound for his
fourth outing of the spring as the Dodgers host the Montreal Expos
at 10:05 a.m. Brown is 0-0 with a 2.31 ERA and has walked one
batter in 112/3 innings. &QL;

 &HT;    Degree of reform will shape IOC's future

   LAUSANNE, Switzerland _ Next year, when the world's 10,000 best
and brightest competitors enter the Olympic stadium in Sydney, the
IOC's nightmare will end, says Anita DeFrantz, the senior U.S.
member of the International Olympic Committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything we do will be criticized until the first athletes
compete in Sydney,'' DeFrantz said last week at the end of the
IOC's emergency session, intended in part to calm the critics.
``That's just the way it is.''
</P>
<P>
   The sordid details of the Salt Lake City bidding scandal will
melt away, as the world remembers whatever it is about the Olympic
Games that makes them so special. The Games always offer a chance
for renewal, but never has the IOC needed the event as it does
these days.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the IOC members, usually accustomed to being fawned
over by eager representatives of bidding cities, often looked more
like organized crime bosses dodging reporters waiting on the
courthouse steps during racketeering trials. Men and women of some
note in their countries, they were reduced to explaining how they
spend the $150-a-day allowances provided them by the IOC when they
travel on committee business.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, Dick Pound, the powerful IOC member from Montreal,
spent several minutes trying to justify to hostile Canadian
reporters a $44 bill he charged the bidding committee in Quebec for
alterations to a sports coat.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was on their bid committee,'' he said solemnly. ``They
wanted my blazer to fit.''
</P>
<P>
   So, they dream of Sydney, and the chance for the universe to
realign once again, with the IOC returned to its place of honor.
</P>
<P>
   Reforms incomplete
</P>
<P>
   IOC members point with satisfaction to the accomplishments of
the emergency session and then express frustration that in the eyes
of many critics _ particularly in the United States _ it did not
seem to be enough.
</P>
<P>
   In an unprecedented act, the IOC expelled six members because
they accepted cash, favors and other gifts from the Salt Lake City
committee bidding for the 2002 Winter Games. Four others had
resigned. The IOC also is forming an ethics commission to help
prevent a repeat of the scandal that threatened the Games. And an
as-yet-unidentified reform panel _ IOC 2000 _ is supposed to draw
up a radical redesign of a body that, except for its bank balance,
has changed little in 105 years.
</P>
<P>
   However, IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch, himself a target
of much of the world's barbs, will chair the reform body. Last
month, Samaranch was rebuffed when he attempted to put himself in
charge of an agency to oversee a worldwide effort to control
doping. Americans and Europeans thought that he lacked credibility.
</P>
<P>
   Asked why he should head the reform commission, Samaranch said
defiantly: ``I am president of the IOC. This commission must be
presided over by the president.''
</P>
<P>
   Samaranch insists the IOC has done what it said it would do.
</P>
<P>
   ``We promised to clean house,'' he said. ``We did it. We
promised reforms. We did it. We promised an Olympics united. It's
done.''
</P>
<P>
   To some, however, the reform process is far from done. In the
United States, the Justice Department continues its investigation
of the Salt Lake scandal and Georgia Gov. Roy Barnes pushes for
opening Atlanta's bid records of the '96 Games.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), the Commerce Committee chairman
and one of the most formidable members of Congress, said the
changes made, while radical by IOC standards, ``fall far short of
the reforms needed to bring transparency and accountability to the
organization.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing I have witnessed provides any substantive movement in
that direction,'' said McCain, who last week issued a series of
daily rebukes about the IOC.
</P>
<P>
   The IOC's harshest critic among corporate sponsors also said the
committee needed to do more. ``I didn't hear any reform yet,'' said
David D'Alessandro, president of John Hancock insurance. ``What I
heard was they are going to study reform.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain said the expulsions were irrelevent and then groused that
the reform effort is bogus because Samaranch will chair the reform
commission and appoint its members. ``It displays a failure to
grasp even the most basic concepts of ethics and reform,'' McCain
said.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. tone baffles IOC
</P>
<P>
   In Lausanne, some IOC members are genuinely befuddled by the
persistance of U.S. lawmakers, who won't drop the matter.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, Senegal's Keba Mbaye strode across the white marble
floors of IOC headquarters reading a copy of McCain's latest
missive and muttering to himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who is this McCain?'' Alex Gilady, an IOC member from Israel,
demanded of an U.S. reporter. ``What does he want?''
</P>
<P>
   A Senate hearing, it seems.
</P>
<P>
   In April, McCain will lead a hearing prompted by the Salt Lake
scandal but broadening its interest to include a inquiry into the
IOC itself. McCain and Sen. Ted Stevens (R-Alaska) have threatened
to revoke the IOC's tax-exempt status, limit the percentage of
sponsorship fees that companies can deduct from their taxes and
redirect TV rights fees to the U.S. Olympic Committee rather than
the IOC.
</P>
<P>
   D'Alessandro says corporations would put their money elsewhere
if Congress stripped tax deductions for Games marketing.
</P>
<P>
   That worries Salt Lake organizers, who need $288 million more
from sponsors to finance its budget. Mitt Romney, the new chairman
of the Salt Lake Organizing Committee, was in Lausanne seeking the
IOC's help in identifying how he can cut the committee's $1.5
billion budget.
</P>
<P>
   In turn, the IOC is angry at the USOC, which threw the blame for
the Salt Lake scandal almost entirely on the international
organization even though it happened in the USOC's backyard.
</P>
<P>
   Many IOC members are saying among themselves that the committee
might just reduce its reliance on U.S. sponsors. If the Coca-Cola
Co., McDonald's or some other big sponsor leaves, IOC marketers
would respond by redoubling its effort in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   It's unlikely that most of the longtime sponsors will leave. But
they will demand that promised reforms materialize. Ben Deutsch,
Coca-Cola spokesman, said: ``Ultimately, the success of this
meeting is going to be determined by the IOC's ability to continue
to quickly define, embrace and enforce the new reform.''

BALLOONISTS COMPLETE CIRCUMNAVIGATION OF GLOBE
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID L. CHANDLER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Achieving what promoters called the last great milestone of
aviation, Bertrand Piccard and Brian Jones joined legends like the
Wright Brothers and Charles Lindbergh with Saturday's completion of
the first manned round-the-world balloon flight.
</P>
<P>
   At 4:54 a.m. EST Saturday, the two balloonists crossed the line
of longitude from which they had departed on March 1 at Chateau
D'Oex, Switzerland, officially earning them the long-sought title
of the first balloon circumnavigation of the globe, as well as a $1
million prize.
</P>
<P>
   The pair hoped to land at about dawn Sunday in Egypt, unless
their dwindling fuel supply forces them to come down earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to his ground crew in Switzerland, Piccard acknowledged
that much of the achievement was due to forces far beyond the
pilots' control.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're really grateful for the invisible hand that guided us
through all obstacles,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Piccard, a 41-year-old Swiss psychiatrist, is the latest in a
family of explorers and record-setters. It was Auguste Piccard, his
grandfather, who in 1931 became the first human to reach the
stratosphere, the first to see the earth's curvature firsthand, and
the inventor of the pressurized cabin, which opened up the frontier
of aviation to regular passenger travel.
</P>
<P>
   And it was his father, Jacques, who in 1960 set a record that
still stands Sunday for the deepest ocean dive, taking the
bathyscaphe Trieste nearly 7 miles deep in the Pacific Ocean's
Mariana Trench.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his illustrious forebears, Piccard grew up among
astronauts as his father worked for the US National Aeronautics and
Space Administration.
</P>
<P>
   ``During my childhood, I have seen a lot of adventurers, and
this gave me the wish to explore something on this beautiful
earth,'' Piccard said two years ago, just before making the first
of his three attempts at the record.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the millions of dollars spent by each team for equipment
and the support crews needed for such voyages, success hinged on a
combination of luck, politics and fortitude. At least two previous
attempts that might have had a chance at succeeding were stymied by
failure to get overflight permission from China and Libya, forcing
them to divert into less favorable wind patterns. This flight, too,
was forced to detour to honor China's requirement to stay south of
26 degrees latitude, but was still able to stay in the high-speed
jetstream needed to propel it to the finish line.
</P>
<P>
   There has been an intense but friendly informal competition for
the round-the-world title since 1993, using innovative balloon
designs. While one record after another was set for distance
traveled and for time aloft, all these earlier efforts ended up
being thwarted by bad weather, technical malfunctions, or political
obstacles. But in the process, the design of high-tech versions of
the venerable Rozier balloon has progressed enormously, bringing
aviation's oldest design straight into the space age.
</P>
<P>
   Satellite navigation systems monitor the balloons' positions,
satellite communications keep them in touch with their control
centers, and satellite weather monitoring provides the guidance
essential to success _ and survival. Even the most high-tech
balloon is still at the mercy of the winds, its only means of
control being to rise or fall in order to catch the winds that seem
to be going in the most promising direction.
</P>
<P>
   It was the invention of the modern Rozier balloon that made the
feat possible, by using modern lightweight plastics for the balloon
itself and by combining the advantages of the two principal types
of balloons: helium and hot air.
</P>
<P>
   Helium's advantage is that it requires no fuel to maintain its
lifting power; its drawback is that as it expands from the sun's
heat, it threatens to tear a balloon apart and must be vented,
depleting its supply. Hot air can provide lifting power whenever it
is needed, but only by carrying huge fuel supplies to heat the air;
when the fuel runs out, the balloon comes down. But a Rozier
combines both, taking advantage of helium's lift during daylight,
and supplementing it at night with hot air.
</P>
<P>
   While there is no obvious practical benefit from this
spectacular feat, the technological advances in balloon design
engendered by the competition may well end up benefiting scientific
research. Scientists already use unpiloted high-altitude balloons
extensively to conduct some kinds of environmental monitoring and
astronomical studies that require a perch high above most of the
atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   Fellow balloonist Richard Branson, whose latest attempt to
circle the world ended with a landing off Hawaii last Christmas
because of bad weather ahead, immediately sent his congratulatious
to the rival team Saturday, calling it a ``magnificent
achievement.''
</P>
<P>
   For the adventurers themselves, the achievement still hadn't
quite sunk in. ``We are having great difficulty realizing our
dreams have come true,'' Piccard said. ``We are with the angels.''

OVITZ KNOWS DECISION IS OUT OF HIS HANDS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BOB KEISSER  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Michael Ovitz faithfully believes the best possible location for
a Los Angeles NFL expansion franchise is the 157-acre site in
Carson that he has been touting to the league for almost a year.
</P>
<P>
   But what he or anyone else involved in the expansion issue
believes won't matter in the end. He says the NFL will decide where
the team plays and who owns it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The issues are not anyone's to decide but the league,'' said
Ovitz, the former head of Creative Artists Agency and ex-president
of The Disney Co., Friday afternoon. ``It only matters what they
think.
</P>
<P>
   ``My goal is to bring football back to Los Angeles, and I'm
working like crazy for Carson....But you can't force them to choose
your site. They'll make the decision, and if they tell me to play
in a sandlot, I will.''
</P>
<P>
   Ovitz has been pushing his site and ownership group, which
includes Ralphs Grocery Chairman Ron Burkle, Magic Johnson and Tom
Cruise, to the league for almost a year. His primary competition
has been a renovated Los Angeles Coliseum proposal led by Kings
owner Ed Roski and billionaire Eli Broad.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, the league voted 29-2 to conditionally give Los
Angeles an expansion franchise. Working with the league's expansion
committee, L.A. has a six-month window to put together a site and
ownership group that meets the league's conditions. If it can't,
the league will put its 32nd team in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   The expansion committee, co-chaired by Carolina Panthers owner
Jerry Richardson and New England Patriots owner Bob Kraft, will
tour the two sites and meet with the two ownership groups in April,
then select one of the two sites.
</P>
<P>
   The issue is whether Ovitz will be asked by the league to join
the Coliseum ownership group. Roski has an exclusive contract with
the Coliseum, and he and Broad are part of a major redevelopment
effort in downtown Los Angeles that includes the new Staples
Center.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan called for unity in L.A.'s NFL
bid this week. Roski has said he would make room for Ovitz, whom he
approached more than two years ago when the New Coliseum proposal
began to take shape, but he has no interest in being part of the
Carson group.
</P>
<P>
   The Carson proposal calls for the building of a retail mall and
a stadium, called The Hacienda, on a site southeast of the 405 and
110 freeway junction. The land has been unused since 1964, the last
year it was used as a landfill.
</P>
<P>
   The city of Carson has environmental approval to build a mall on
the site, and is seeking supplemental approval for the stadium
project. Glimcher Realty, a company specializing in mall
construction and ownership, has an option to buy the land, and
Herbert Glimcher is a member of the Ovitz ownership group.
</P>
<P>
   The 6-to-9 month timeline for purchase and environmental
remediation of the site is built into a timeline that would have
the stadium ready for play in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   Last month NFL commissioner Paul Tagliabue, Richardson and other
league officials visited Carson to view the site and meet with
members of the Ovitz group. Tagliabue said the league had no
questions about the environmental aspect of the site, and that the
Carson plan met more of the league's criteria than the Coliseum.
</P>
<P>
   The Carson project includes an investment of $180 million by the
city, in the form of $30 million in cash reserved set aside several
years ago for mall construction and a $150 million bond issue. City
officials are studying whether it can raise additional funds
through a redevelopment agency.
</P>
<P>
   The New Coliseum proposal claims to have a public investment of
more than $300 million, but only $40 million of that is fresh
money. The balance is in the form of already completed
infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
   Ovitz said the process hasn't been as stressful as some may
think. ``In some ways, it's been easy,'' he said, ``because the
decision is out of my hands.''

TENNESSEE BEATS VIRGINIA TECH, 68-52  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By BARRY JACOBS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   GREENSBORO, N.C. _ Pat Summitt figures her dominating Tennessee
team is good for at least two offensive explosions a game. Saturday
afternoon at the Greensboro Coliseum, it took a single burst by the
top-seeded Lady Vols to subdue Virginia Tech, 68-52, in the East
Regional semifinals of the National Collegiate Athletic Association
tournament.
</P>
<P>
   The victory, sparked by a 16-0 run in the first half, improved
Tennessee's record to 31-2.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday night, the three-time defending national champion will
face third-seeded Duke, a 76-63 winner over Old Dominion in
Saturday's first game before 13,204 fans, an East Regional record.
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee and Duke, which starts three seniors, met on a neutral
court in early December, with the Lady Vols winning, 74-60.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Duke has a chance,'' Bonnie Henrickson, the coach of
fourth-seeded Virginia Tech, said. ``I think their experience will
help them, quite honestly.''
</P>
<P>
   Undaunted by the familiar, haunting strains of the song ``Rocky
Top'' and by Tennessee's superior size, depth and reputation,
Virginia Tech (28-3) matched the Lady Vols stride for stride
through the game's first 11 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   There were eight lead changes and three ties in that span as the
Hokies repeatedly shrugged off Tennessee's defensive pressure. But
the Vols managed to stay even thanks to 11 points from Chamique
Holdsclaw, their four-time all-American, who finished with a
game-high 27 points. Then, after an inside basket by Tere Williams
put the Hokies ahead by 18-17 with 9 minutes 45 seconds left in the
half, Tennessee exploded.
</P>
<P>
   Fueled by their defense, the Vols scored 16 unanswered points,
building their lead to 33-18 on a layup by guard Semeka Randall
with 3:01 left in the half.
</P>
<P>
   Randall, a sophomore all-American, played despite two torn
ligaments in her left ankle, which she injured in Tennessee's
first-round game against Appalachian State. A starter all year,
Randall came off the bench Saturday to spark Tennessee's run.
</P>
<P>
   ``As soon as she comes in she gets a steal, a score,'' Holdsclaw
said. ``She's just instant emotions and intensity, and we need that
from her.''
</P>
<P>
   Virginia Tech committed 7 of its 26 turnovers in the decisive
run. Five came on consecutive possessions.
</P>
<P>
   ``What most people don't understand is how much ground they can
cover and how fast they can cover it,'' Henrickson said of
Tennessee. ``They turn your turnover into a lay-up drill.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; DUKE 76, OLD DOMINION 63 &LR;
</P>
<P>
   In the opening game, Duke (27-6) took the lead at the 16:40 mark
of the first half, and despite 24 turnovers kept the more physical
Lady Monarchs at bay. Second-seeded Old Dominion, from the Colonial
Athletic Association, was impatient against Duke's zone defense.
Weak shooters from the perimeter all year, the Monarchs hit only 1
of 11 3-pointers in the first half and 1 of 14 (7.1 percent) on
3-pointers for the game.
</P>
<P>
   That ineffectiveness helped the Blue Devils survive their
difficulties with Old Dominion's pressure defense, as well as foul
trouble that negated the impact of the all-American Michele Van
Gorp, Duke's 6-foot-6-inch senior center.
</P>
<P>
   The Blue Devils weathered six ties and led, 35-31, at halftime.
</P>
<P>
   Old Dominion (28-4) pulled within 38-36 with 18:36 remaining,
but the poised Blue Devils responded with an 11-2 run, capped by a
layup off a steal by Peppi Browne. That pushed Duke's advantage to
49-38 with 12:42 left, and Old Dominion never drew closer than 5
points thereafter.
</P>
<P>
   Duke, an at-large entrant from the Atlantic Coast Conference,
was led by Nicole Erickson with 24 points and 7 rebounds.

CONNECTICUT BEATS GONZAGA, 67-62  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By THOMAS GEORGE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ When Connecticut's Kevin Freeman grabbed the bounding
ball and flung it high toward the America West Arena rafters,
frustration and the burdens of high expectation went with it.
Connecticut can dance. And smile. And proudly wear the look of a
team that just reached the other side.
</P>
<P>
   It is over. The underachieving label for Connecticut; the
season, the dream for Gonzaga. On Saturday, Connecticut tripped
Gonzaga, 67-62, in a doozy of a game here in the West Regional
final before 18,053 fans. And now Connecticut (32-2) boldly dashes
where it has never been before in its 21 trips to the National
Collegiate Athletic Association men's basketball tournament: into
the Final Four.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the last 10 years we've had some teams make a run toward
the Final Four,'' Jim Calhoun, the Connecticut coach, said. ``I'm
not disappointed in any of those kids. This is for them.''
</P>
<P>
   Connecticut won this game with a penchant for rebounding, with
timely shots and with defense that was persistent, deflating and
enduring.
</P>
<P>
   The defining moment came with 34.4 seconds remaining and with
Connecticut ahead, 65-62, on the strength of two Khalid El-Amin
free throws. After a timeout during which Calhoun set his defense
and Dan Monson, the Gonzaga coach, set his offense, the teams
battled. Gonzaga was looking for a 3-pointer. Connecticut was
ready.
</P>
<P>
   It denied the perimeter, storming to the 3-point arc, extending
its defense and making the Gonzaga attempt impossible. Soon there
were 10 seconds left and, still, not one good Gonzaga look at the
basket. Spinning, toiling against a wall of defense _ that was the
Gonzaga offense on that key possession.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Gonzaga guard Matt Santangelo fired an off-balance shot
that floated toward the basket and missed, and Freeman grabbed the
rebound and was fouled with 6.2 seconds left. Freeman _
Connecticut's 6-foot-7-inch junior forward who grabbed 15 rebounds
(10 offensive), scored 13 points and made the West Regional
tournament team _ made both free throws, which were the game's
final points.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzaga muffed the inbounds play and the ball bounded away
toward the baseline.
</P>
<P>
   Freeman grabbed it, though.
</P>
<P>
   And up into the rafters it went.
</P>
<P>
   ``What a feeling!'' Freeman said. It was that way for all of the
Connecticut players and coaches. Relief. Achievement. They swiped
it by taking a hot-shooting team and making it suffer, holding it
to 20-of-57 floor shooting, or 35.1 percent. It limited Gonzaga to
an awful 5 for 21 (23.8 percent) in 3-pointers.
</P>
<P>
   Monson said: ``Both defenses did a good job of disrupting the
other team's offense. They got us out of our offensive flow. And
then when we did finally get good shots, a lot of times we rushed
them and missed them, shots we normally make. That was as good a
defense we have seen this year.''
</P>
<P>
   Richie Frahm, Gonzaga's sharpest shooter, was 2 for 11.
</P>
<P>
   ``They took us out of our game and the 3-point shots,'' Frahm
said. ``We just broke down mentally. We really didn't step up the
challenge. Too bad we couldn't do better.''
</P>
<P>
   Santangelo was 1 for 9 from the floor, including his big miss at
the end.
</P>
<P>
   ``I probably should have passed it,'' Santangelo said. ``At that
point though, the clock was ticking.''
</P>
<P>
   Against Gonzaga.
</P>
<P>
   In the first half, though, Gonzaga was more timely. It led at
halftime, 32-31. It did so by matching Connecticut's intensity on
defense and by fighting on the boards. Connecticut usually
manhandles teams in rebounding, but at halftime, its rebounding
edge was only 22-19.
</P>
<P>
   Connecticut forward Richard Hamilton scored 11 points in the
first half. He saw and felt the Gonzaga push in a half where
Connecticut's biggest lead was 4 points and where Gonzaga's was 3.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew this could have been my last game,'' Hamilton said.
``That kind of scared me. I went out to do something to try and
change it.''
</P>
<P>
   And he did. He scored 10 more points in the second half, played
superb defense on Santangelo and others and always seemed to make
the big shots that Connecticut needed to keep the game manageable.
Connecticut would establish itself in rebounding, too, winning the
second half by 25-14. It held the edge n offensive boards for the
game by 21-13.
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton played all but three minutes of the game and was named
the most valuable player of the regional. Ricky Moore also made the
all-regional team, giving Connecticut three-fourths of the club.
</P>
<P>
   Moore was dynamic in a sneaky way: he played more minutes (38)
that anyone, scored 12 points, grabbed 3 rebounds, made 3 assists,
had 1 steal and committed only 1 turnover. Moore was a true glue.
</P>
<P>
   And that is what Connecticut was at the end, more glued, more
sure of itself than Gonzaga. The Gonzaga season was full of magic,
a 28-7 season in which it slew giant after giant.
</P>
<P>
   Guard Quentin Hall's team-best 18 points were not enough for
Gonzaga.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are a tremendous, athletic team,'' forward Jeremy Eaton
said. ``They crashed us pretty hard. This was not the way we wanted
it to end. That is the bad thing about college basketball _ unless
you win the national championship, it ends with a loss. In a couple
of days we will realize where we were. We were among the top eight
teams in college basketball.''
</P>
<P>
   Santangelo said: ``It was a long and crazy ride.''

 &HT;    Bush's run for presidency met with bipartisan support
 &HT;    By Juan B. Elizondo Jr. and Ken Herman
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ With Republican Gov. George W. Bush moving
toward a likely race for the White House, political veterans might
expect Texas Democrats to be setting fires and roadblocks for him.
</P>
<P>
   But this is Texas, where the governor has gone to great lengths
to work with Democrats, and what there is of partisanship is
largely kept out of the legislative process.
</P>
<P>
   ``Democrats don't feel that we need to throw stumbling blocks in
his way,'' said Rep. Pete Gallego of Alpine, chairman of the House
Democratic Caucus.
</P>
<P>
   ``He seems very focused,'' according to Rep. Patricia Gray,
D-Galveston.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to be cooperative in all efforts,'' said Sen. Gonzalo
Barrientos, D-Austin, chairman of the Senate Democratic Caucus.
</P>
<P>
   It's not that Texas politics is a pure lovefest. But unlike in
Congress and other state legislatures, political fights in Texas
most often erupt over spending priorities and policy issues.
</P>
<P>
   For example, a Bush-backed plan to cut taxes for owners of small
oil and gas wells passed the Legislature this month. But not before
Democrats felt certain that a children's health-care program will
cover more children than some Republicans want.
</P>
<P>
   To the amazement of non-Texans, and the likely chagrin of
Democratic presidential hopefuls, the Texas Legislature is a world
largely dominated by political realists.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the Texas Legislature, there is a strong need to get
along,'' said former Democratic Land Commissioner Garry Mauro, who
challenged Bush for the governor's office last year. ``No
Democratic senator or House member is going to strongly criticize
the governor at this point because there is still the promise that
he'll sign the bills that they can get through the Legislature.''
</P>
<P>
   The last governor who made a serious bid for the White House
didn't catch a similar break. It's as much a testament to Bush's
bipartisan efforts as to the nonpartisan nature of Texas politics.
</P>
<P>
   When then-Arkansas Gov. Bill Clinton began running for president
in 1992, he fielded loads of criticism from both the opposition and
his own party.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he is the lesser of evils, we will work our butts off for
him, but we have had our differences,'' Bill Becker, then the
president of the heavily Democratic Arkansas AFL-CIO, said at the
time.
</P>
<P>
   Also unlike Bush, Clinton fielded pointed and public criticism
from former state government associates.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyer Scott Trotter was among those more than willing to speak
harshly against the governor. Trotter served as an assistant when
Clinton was Arkansas attorney general in 1977-1978.
</P>
<P>
   ``He became less and less of a people's champion'' after
becoming governor, Trotter said at the time, ``and more and more of
an institutional politician trying to gain business support for
certain initiatives.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush exploratory committee Mindy Tucker said Texans of both
leading parties respect that the governor has stayed home.
</P>
<P>
   ``Governor Bush has been a uniter and not a divider,'' Tucker
said. ``He has worked with people of both parties.''
</P>
<P>
   Political outsiders, however, expected problems for Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``My guess is that the Clinton-Gore team may well be on the
phone to key Texas Democratic legislators attempting to set various
and sundry bear traps during the session for him,'' University of
Virginia political scientist Larry Sabato said in January. At the
time, he was shocked to learn that Democrats here say nice things
about Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know there was such a Legislature in the country,''
Sabato said. ``I never heard there was such a nonpartisan
approach.''
</P>
<P>
   Barrientos said Democrats are focused on issues, not politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a job to do here right now,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Texas isn't Arkansas or Congress, added Mauro, who's helping to
raise money for Vice President Al Gore's presidential campaign.
Mauro said that in 16 years in office, eight under a Republican, he
never spoke badly about the sitting governor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody understands elected officials have to do what makes
the most sense for their constituencies and their political careers
and their political goals,'' Mauro said. ``The idea that somebody
would fall on the sword and criticize George Bush to help Al Gore _
it just doesn't happen in Texas. Maybe it happens in other states,
but I've never seen it happen in Texas.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's proposal to end social promotion is another example of
Democrats working with Republicans to achieve their goals. The bill
has cleared the Senate, but didn't get needed Democratic votes
until provisions they wanted were added to it.
</P>
<P>
   Former Clinton adviser Paul Begala said he, too, isn't surprised
that Texas Democrats aren't loudly bad-mouthing Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even as a fire-breathing partisan, I believe your first
obligation is to help Texas,'' said Begala, a Texan and former
Texas legislative aide. ``I think the Democrats are right to do
their best to lead their governor toward sensible and centrist
policies.''
</P>
<P>
   Begala, a Gore supporter, said Arkansas Republicans' efforts to
derail Clinton in 1992 went nowhere. Purely partisan shots don't
work, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be a good thing for the system if partisan opponents
began with the premise that the other party is the opposition, not
the enemy,'' Begala said. ``Bush is a decent guy. What's wrong with
saying that? I think he is wrong on issues and doesn't have many
big ideas, and I'd rather him not be my president, but he is not a
bad human being.''
</P>
<P>
   Texas Democratic Party Chairman Molly Beth Malcolm added that
any Bush success comes because of help from Democrats. The Texas
Senate is narrowly controlled by Republicans 16-15. Democrats hold
the House with 78 of the 150 seats.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's important for people to remember that the only
reason he has been successful is because of the Democrats that have
been willing to work on issues important to Texans rather than
making a partisan fight,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Even though fellow Democrats say the governor appears focused on
the Legislature, Malcolm isn't convinced.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is only 24 hours in a day, and with all those foreign
dignitaries and delegations coming to the governor's mansion, how
in the world can the man be focusing on the Legislature?'' she
asked.
</P>
<P>
   An ever so slight bad word about Bush's availability to
lawmakers: ``Instead of seeing him in 24 hours, it takes 48 or
72,'' Rep. Gray said.
</P>
<P>
   She quickly added that once in with Bush _ something that's
happened more than once this year for the chairwoman of the House
Public Health Committee _ the governor appeared aware and
knowledgeable about the issues at hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'd be less than human if he wasn't a little distracted,''
Gray said. But ``he seems very focused.''
</P>
<P>
   The get-along attitude could play into Bush's presidential bid _
if he makes it.
</P>
<P>
   During his State of the State address, Bush noted that Texas
lawmakers have a chance to show Congress and other states how to
operate.
</P>
<P>
   ``We sometimes disagree, but we do so agreeably,'' he said. ``We
know we serve Texans best when we work together in a spirit of
cooperation and respect, when we seek common ground based on Texas
values.''
</P>
<P>
   The greatest tests are yet to come. Bush's centerpiece proposal
to lower property taxes and allow more money for teachers got a
late start last week after delays because of Democratic opposition.
Republicans acknowledge that they will have to work with Democrats
to get it done.
</P>
<P>
   Gray said political reality means more than getting bills
signed.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are very concerned that we don't do anything
intentionally embarrassing,'' she said. ``It would be good for
Democrats and Republicans for there to be a Texas president.''

MORE BAD NEWS FOR ANGELS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPE, Ariz. _ Pitcher Ken Hill, who is coming off elbow
surgery, wandered over to see what all the commotion was about.
</P>
<P>
   Several reporters surrounded someone, but who? Was it Mo Vaughn?
Tim Salmon? Chuck Finley?
</P>
<P>
   No, team orthopedist Dr. Lewis Yocum was holding court.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a bad sign, when the doctor is getting most of the
attention in the clubhouse,'' Hill said.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, the injury situation hasn't been (begin ital)that(end
ital) bad for the Angels this spring, other than the broken bone in
shortstop Gary DiSarcina's left forearm.
</P>
<P>
   But on Saturday it was announced that catcher Matt Walbeck,
expected to get most of the starts behind the plate, will miss the
next three to four weeks with a broken bone in his right hand. And
pitcher Jason Dickson will be out indefinitely with a torn labrum
in his right (pitching) shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   Dickson will try to treat the shoulder with therapy during the
next two weeks. But if there is no significant improvement, he'll
have to have surgery, which would sideline him at least three or
four months and possibly for the entire season.
</P>
<P>
   ``You come in in the morning and find out one guy's out for a
month and another guy's out for three months, you just want to stop
playing,'' Angels manager Terry Collins said. ``Let 'em hit and
wait until April.''
</P>
<P>
   There were more injury problems Saturday, though not as serious.
Center fielder Jim Edmonds missed his second game in a row and will
probably miss the next two with a tight groin. Outfielder Reggie
Williams pulled a hamstring and will be out for the next couple of
days.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, I'm not getting used to it,'' Collins said when asked
about the yearly struggle with injuries in camp. ``You never get
used to losing key players. I'm getting pretty sick of it, I know
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Yocum said Dickson had a sore shoulder, typical for spring
training, but was just starting to feel good until earlier this
week when he felt a pinching sensation. He had an MRI Friday which
revealed the tear.
</P>
<P>
   Walbeck was injured Wednesday when checking his swing in a game
at minor league camp. But he didn't have X-rays until Friday; they
revealed a non-displaced fracture of the fifth metacarpal on the
right hand (between the thumb and index finger). He was fitted with
a splint.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt it burn after I checked my swing, but I didn't know if
it was an old injury because I've had two broken bones in the same
hand,'' he said. ``I didn't think it was anything because I've had
to play with pain in the hand before. ... It's kind of a drag. I
was shocked when they told me it was broken. It's so close to the
season.''
</P>
<P>
   The Angels split two games with the Giants Saturday afternoon,
winning 7-3 in Scottsdale and losing 6-5 in Tempe.
</P>
<P>
   Troy Glaus continued his hot streak with two hits and two RBI in
the Angels' win. Starter Omar Olivares further solidified his hold
on the No.5 spot with five good innings _ one run, five hits, four
strikeouts, no walks.
</P>
<P>
   In the Angels' loss, the Giants scored three runs in the ninth
off losing pitcher Mike Fyhrie. Orlando Palmeiro, vying for one of
the final spots on the roster, had three hits.
</P>
<P>
   Todd Greene made his second appearance of the spring at catcher,
going five innings in the game in Tempe. Nobody tried to steal on
Greene, so he didn't get a chance to test his shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   ``The test is trying to throw somebody out at game speed,'' said
Greene, who will catch five innings again Tuesday. ``But I don't
anticipate any problems. I don't care if I throw the guy out, as
long as it doesn't hurt.''
</P>
<P>
   Second baseman Justin Baughman will likely have a second surgery
on his broken left leg next week. Baughman suffered multiple
fractures in a winter league game in Mexico on Nov. 7. The healing
process has gone slower than expected and a second surgery has been
recommended.
</P>
<P>
   Baughman has seen a number of doctors who have advised him of
the different procedures he could undergo, which could help him
return sooner, possibly before the end of this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not going to expedite things just because he's a
baseball player,'' Yocum said. ``But we feel we've given it an
adequate amount of time (to heal). It's not unreasonable to
consider surgery.''
</P>
<P>
   Pep Harris, another Mexican League victim (torn ligament in
right elbow), is in town for treatment. He will miss the entire
season, but is upbeat. ``The way it feels now I feel like I'll come
back better than before, he said. ... DiSarcina will have his left
forearm re-examined and X-rayed Wednesday. At that point it will be
decided if the bone has healed enough for him to shed the cast and
begin hitting and fielding. ... Jack McDowell threw Saturday for
the first time since shoulder surgery on Feb. 3. ... The Angels
travel to Phoenix today to play the A's at 12:05. Chuck Finley is
scheduled to go three innings against the A's Kevin Jarvis.

NBA FULL OF REAL-LIFE DRAMAS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY HILL  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Grading on a curve that's nearly as severe as the arc on Allen
Iverson's crossover dribble, we will render our mid-term verdict as
NBA-minus.
</P>
<P>
   Without training camp, it's just camp. But the playoffs can be
used for extra credit. With any luck, we'll all qualify for a Phi
Beta Salary Kappa key.
</P>
<P>
   However, the league's abbreviated season is not without a few
repelling stories. Instead of reflecting upon those, we present the
following real-basketball-life inspired dramas that are in the
planning stages at the NBA Entertainment Network in Secaucus, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, Iverson and 76ers coach Larry ``Get Ouf Of Town'' Brown
are as chummy these days as two sportswriters in a buffet line, but
- given Larry's history - something is bound to go haywire. Follow
the trail of laughter and the tears in a doomed relationship on
``Murphy's Law Brown.''
</P>
<P>
   According to his critics, Dennis Rodman is to the Lakers' title
hopes as Y2K is to your bank account come New Year's Day. See how
Dennis conquers his personal demons by partying (because it's 1999)
in the raw and uncut ``Tattoo On The Town.''
</P>
<P>
   Ever wonder if Michael Jordan curses other drivers on the
freeway? Does he prefer Leno or Letterman? For the answers to these
and three or four other vital inquiries, we can turn to his
sideline buddy Rashad from NBC, star of the tell-all special
``Ahmad About You.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though he now plays for the Rockets, Scottie Pippen remains
full of Bull. After being beamed aboard by Houston, Pip discovers
that Hakeem Olajuwon and Charles Barkley don't mind hogging the
ball. To see if Pippen gets a ride on the clue bus, don't miss 30
minutes of hilarious locker room banter in ``Just Shoot ... Me?''
</P>
<P>
   Our next comedy set in Minnesota features decimal-point guard
Stephon Marbury and agent David Falk concocting a caper that will
make Stephon filthy rich and return him to the Big Apple. You'll be
up to your saddlebags in laughter when Marbury only gets it as far
as New Jersey in ``Wells Fargo.'' A surefire hit? You betcha.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of New Jersey ... this is the city ... East Rutherford.
My names is Calipari ... I carry a resume. Look for me in the
upcoming NBA mystery ``Drag Nets.''
</P>
<P>
   Do you think you know about loss? You don't know anything about
loss. But you can learn. All you have to do is sit in front of a
television while NBA airs its brutal documentary ``Tales From The
Clips.''
</P>
<P>
   The price is not Wright
</P>
<P>
   It is a common perception that the Clippers are a bunch of cheap
nitwits who refuse to break out the serious scoots in order to
re-sign players.
</P>
<P>
   Not true.
</P>
<P>
   Before last weekend's contract-extension deadline for the NBA
Draft class of 1996, they made an offer to center Lorenzen Wright
that is believed to be about half of his agent's original goal of
$60 million over six seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``They did make an offer that was substantial,'' Robert Fayne,
the agent, said, ``but we didn't feel the offer was consistent with
Lorenzen's market value.''
</P>
<P>
   Lorenzen is averaging about six points and eight rebounds per
game. Five big ones per season for that? Ten? You decide.
</P>
<P>
   The Clippers will not confirm the contract numbers, choosing to
- for now at least - keep that issue between themselves and the
agent.
</P>
<P>
   Neither side has ruled out the possibility of coming to terms
after the season.
</P>
<P>
   More Net work
</P>
<P>
   Before Calipari was tossed overboard in Jersey, the Nets were
subjected to rigorous confidence-building gymnastics. One desperate
measure included a visit from motivational evangelist Anthony
Robbins. Robbins, it has been reported, employed the slump-killing
technique of encouraging Nets players to hit the boards.
</P>
<P>
   Really.
</P>
<P>
   Following his lead, they broke boards with their bare hands.
</P>
<P>
   In our opinion, the Nets would draw more inspiration if somebody
contracted a visit from Baskin-Robbins.
</P>
<P>
   Shot-clock violations
</P>
<P>
   Can't get enough of Calipari? Too bad. The latest gift from the
grapevine has the former UMass coach in the catbird seat at
Michigan. But Michigan's catbird seat is occupied, right? That's
the interesting part. ... Wally ``World Tour'' Szczerbiak, Miami of
Ohio's contribution to the ``Next Larry Bird'' derby, also has been
favorably compared to Phoenix forward Tom Gugliotta. However, two
NBA scouts have told us - after violent eye rolling when Bird is
mentioned - that Szczerbiak can best be described as Kiki
Vandeweghe with muscles. Not bad company. Vandeweghe averaged more
than 20 points per game for seven consecutive seasons. ... Karl
Malone probably is thrilled that Elden Campbell was traded out of
the Western Conference by the Lakers. In Friday's Utah loss in
Charlotte, Malone missed 16 of 21 shots while attempting to fire
over the taller and bouncier Campbell. ... According to rumor,
Jerry Krause, vice president of basketball operations for the
Chicago Bulls, has cancelled his voice-mail service. Now, if you
dial Jerry's number, the system just hangs up after six rings.

 &HT;    Florida attack on anti-smoking campaign has precedents in Calif.
 &HT;    By Mary Ellen Klas
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   TALLAHASSEE _ A state health department begins an anti-tobacco
campaign with confrontational ads that blast the industry for lying
to smokers. Surveys show the program is reducing smoking. The
program director is fired.
</P>
<P>
   That scenario describes Florida last week, except it also
happened in California _ seven years ago. The addendum to the West
Coast story: The Republican governor forced the program to change
direction. The ads were toned down or dropped. The new focus was on
education. Smoking rates rose.
</P>
<P>
   Veterans of the anti-smoking crusade say the Florida
Legislature's attack on the year-old, anti-smoking program is
similar to the attacks sustained by tobacco control programs in
other states.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of this stuff is nothing new,'' said Stan Glantz, a
professor of medicine at the University of California at San
Francisco, whose aggressive criticism of the industry has made him
an enemy of tobacco companies. ``With most state programs, the
better they work, the more they get to keep going. With tobacco,
the better they work, the less they get.''
</P>
<P>
   Florida lawmakers built their budgets this year with with the
bounty of the state's $13 billion settlement against the tobacco
industry _ $920 million. It was enough to pay for at least $58
million in legislators' pet projects, expand health insurance for
needy children, eliminate the waiting list for at home care for the
elderly and pay for dozens of other health programs.
</P>
<P>
   But it may not be enough to pay for the program aimed at
stopping kids from smoking.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Jeb Bush initially indicated he supported the tobacco
control program and asked legislators to spend $61.5 million to
continue it. But House leaders, led by House Speaker John Thrasher
who personally opposes the program, eliminated it. The Senate
supported it for $50 million, a number the agency said it could
live with.
</P>
<P>
   The idea didn't sit well with students involved in the local
youth groups financed by the program. They had been integral in the
development of the ads and were committed to it. A day after they
rallied at the state Capitol, raucously protesting the budget cuts,
the program director, Peter Mitchell, was fired.
</P>
<P>
   That same day, the agency released the results of the youth
tobacco survey, conducted by the Florida Department of Health in
collaboration with the Centers for Disease Control: Youth smoking
dropped nearly 3 percent in one year.
</P>
<P>
   The numbers astounded researchers, marketers, epidemiologists
and anti-tobacco advocates accustomed to seeing youth smoking rise
each year in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Glantz, who teaches statistics, said, ``The methods are all very
standard and off the shelf and using questions from the CDC.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the survey showed ``the most amazing reduction in youth
smoking I've ever seen.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It shows that Florida has perhaps the most effective
anti-tobacco program in the world,'' beamed Ed Trapido, a professor
of epidemiology and public health at the University of Miami, who
was hired to evaluate the program.
</P>
<P>
   He said that the results also showed that the ad campaign was
working. ``In a small sample where youth were reinterviewed, almost
50 percent who had thought about smoking but hadn't, said the
reason was because of the anti-tobacco TV ads,'' Trapido said.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Novelli, director of the Campaign for Tobacco Free Kids and
a consultant to the program, said the survey results have
positioned Florida as the model for the nation as other states
decide how to spend their tobacco settlement money.
</P>
<P>
   ``People don't understand how difficult it is to change
behavior,'' Novelli said. ``Tobacco is addictive. This is like an
expansion team coming onto the field and scoring a touchdown.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Florida Secretary of the Department of Health, Bob
Brooks, downplayed the results of the survey. He said he supports
the program but wants it to take a different approach _ focus more
on college students and education.
</P>
<P>
   There is a reason all of this is familiar, said Glantz, who has
written a book on the California experience. It is a pattern that
has followed anti-tobacco efforts from Massachusetts and New York
to Arizona and California. In each of those states, the director of
a successful program has been fired, survey results have been
challenged and, in California, aggressive ads were taken off the
air until the American Heart Association sued to get them back on.
</P>
<P>
   Novelli believes the resistance is a culmination of ``years of
political contributions'' from cigarette manufacturers that have
``a long, chronic kind of effect on the legislative process'' and
lawmakers who don't want government involved in telling kids not to
smoke. ``They see it as big brother and nannyism,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Thrasher said Friday he believes smoking is an issue of
personal responsibility, not one in which the state should be
involved.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've raised three children and none of them smoked and they
don't smoke because they had parents who encouraged them not to
smoke and they took individual responsibility on those things,'' he
said. He added that he would prefer to spend the advertising
dollars on cancer research and education programs to encourage
personal responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   The tobacco industry has clearly disliked Florida's ads. When it
negotiated the national settlement last year, it insisted a clause
be included banning the use of tobacco money to pay for ads
attacking tobacco companies, like the Florida ads did.
</P>
<P>
   The tobacco litigation also exposed the techniques the industry
may use to counter Florida's efforts. Documents released in the
tobacco lawsuit brought against the industry by the state of
Minnesota, revealed that three days after California aired its
first anti-industry ads in 1990, the industry's lobbying arm
composed a memo about how to undercut the ad campaign.
</P>
<P>
   According to the memo produced by the Tobacco Institute, the
industry would use three primary strategies to kill the ads:
</P>
<P>
   _ Encourage legislative leaders to intervene.
</P>
<P>
   _ Use ``third-party allies'' to convince the department head to
``pull or modify the current advertisements.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Encourage the governor to intervene against the ads.
</P>
<P>
   The memo also described how it would attempt to get the minority
community upset about the ``denigrating tones'' of the ads, get
Hispanics and black professionals to ask for money to be used
instead on health services in their communities and get the
alcoholic beverage industry concerned that the ads are headed on a
``slippery advertising slope.''
</P>
<P>
   Advocates of Florida's program hope they won't have to counter
that kind of attack. ``We had a two-year commitment to fund a pilot
program,'' said Ralph DeVitto of the Florida chapter of the
American Cancer Society. ``We're asking that they keep that promise
and we'll go from there.''

 &HT;    Regional finals are Chaney's bane
 &HT;    By Tony Barnhart
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ Fair or not, one of the primary
measuring sticks used to judge coaching greatness in college
basketball is the ability to take teams to the Final Four. That's
why John Chaney will be the emotional favorite today when Temple
takes on No. 1 Duke for the NCAA East Regional championship.
</P>
<P>
   Chaney, 67, has won 605 games in 27 years as a college coach. In
17 seasons at Temple, he has taken the Owls to 15 NCAA Tournaments,
including the current string of 10 straight. He has won six
Atlantic-10 regular season championships. He won a Division II
national championship at Cheyney State in 1978. He is the
sixth-winningest active coach in the sport.
</P>
<P>
   But for all his success, the Jacksonville, Fla., native has not
reached a Final Four. Today marks Chaney's fourth regional
championship game, and all of the three previous losses were filled
with heartache.
</P>
<P>
   In 1988, Temple lost to Duke on this very floor (63-53) when
All-American Mark Macon was shut down by Billy King, the Blue
Devils' defensive specialist.
</P>
<P>
   In 1991, the Owls came back to East Rutherford and were in
position to win when North Carolina's King Rice banked home a
3-pointer to lead the Tar Heels to a 75-72 victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still think about that shot,'' Chaney said.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993 Temple led Michigan's Fab Five by 10 points in the
second half of the West Regional championship. But the Owls let the
Wolverines off the ropes and lost 77-72.
</P>
<P>
   So today, Temple's players want this one not for themselves, but
for the raspy-voiced grandfather.
</P>
<P>
   ``To give Coach the first Final Four of his life, that would be
a dream,'' guard Pepe Sanchez said. ``It would absolutely be the
best feeling in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Duke coach Mike Krzyzewski, who will be going for his eighth
Final Four appearance today, said it would be a mistake to judge
Chaney's career simply on whether he eventually reaches the Final
Four.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the nature of sport that there has to be this kind of
magical moment that defines a career,'' Krzyzewski said. ``But look
at what John has done. He should be in the Hall of Fame no matter
if he ever gets to the Final Four.''
</P>
<P>
   If Chaney never reaches the Final Four, he is content that his
consistent success, which includes 21 seasons with 20 or more wins,
will provide a suitable legacy. But would he like to go to his
first Final Four? You better believe it.
</P>
<P>
   ``What a great feeling it would be,'' Chaney said. ``It would be
like having all the peanut butter you could eat. It would be like
getting that bicycle I never had..''
</P>
<P>
   Krzyzewski understands. He still remembers the excitement of
beating Navy in the East Regional final here in 1986 for his first
Final Four trip. He also remembers the pain of his first loss in a
regional championship game, which came to Kentucky last March.
</P>
<P>
   ``Seven times we've gone, and I've felt the same way every
time,'' Krzyzewski said. ``And last year when we didn't go there
was an empty feeling because we weren't there.''

 &HT;    Cats' Padgett finally gets it right
 &HT;    By Steve Hummer
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS _ As he measures Michigan State and today's Midwest
Regional final, which some predict will be a steel-cage,
best-two-out-of-three-falls affair, Kentucky's Scott Padgett offers
a distinctly different scouting report.
</P>
<P>
   ``If (the Spartans) were a wrestler, they'd be Ric Flair. They
wear you down and wear you down and then put the finishing move on
you,'' said the Wildcats senior foward. That for the benefit of
those who are more WCW than NCAA.
</P>
<P>
   One may question Padgett's taste in television. And to see him
try on a menacing glare after burying a 3-point shot against Miami
University Friday _ only to look severely constipated _ you can
doubt his ability to truly menace. ``I do some goofy things
sometimes,'' he said, explaining the face that was more comical
than intimidating.
</P>
<P>
   But for every goofball, there is hope. In Padgett you have a
player whose first instinct upon entering the sacred realm of
Kentucky basketball was to see how many breweries he could drain.
And, yet, here he is today, the Wildcats' designated driver to
another Final Four.
</P>
<P>
   On the floor, he is expressing himself with a game versatile
enough to lead Kentucky in both 3-point scoring and rebounding.
This time of year, Kentucky always seems to identify one shooter it
can count on. Now, among a core of three seniors, Padgett seems the
one chosen to be the next Jeff Sheppard.
</P>
<P>
   He has led Kentucky in scoring four of its last five games,
going for 20 in the championship game of the SEC Tournament and a
season-high 29 in an overtime victory against Kansas in the second
round of the NCAAs. His two second-half 3-pointers against Miami
seemed to fuel the Wildcats' finish.
</P>
<P>
   A naturally easygoing demeanor does turn fiery on demand.
``Scott knows when it's time to joke around and when it's time for
business,'' said point guard Wayne Turner.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Padgett) is the best player in the SEC in terms of playing
the game of basketball, doing what it takes,'' South Carolina coach
Eddie Fogler announced earlier this season.
</P>
<P>
   If Michigan State comes out today playing its usual burly Big 10
kind of game, Padgett claims he will be unconcerned. ``We've played
a lot of physical teams this year and been successful. We can
adapt,'' he said. Maybe all those hours of watching pro 'rasslin on
TV finally will come to some good.
</P>
<P>
   The maturing of Scott Padgett has been most impressive in
another venue. Upon entering Kentucky, his weight training included
regular 12-ounce curls. ``I would have lost count (of his beer
consumption) real early. How do you think I got from 205 to 230 my
freshman year?'' he said. He flunked out his sophomore year, then
had to gradually work his way back into Rick Pitino's favor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm more proud of what I've done in the classroom,'' said
Padgett, who made himself over into an honor student. ``I always
knew I could do it on the court. The classroom was something else.
When I first got to college, I thought, `Man, this is really hard.'
Of course, you can't go to class once a week and expect to do
well.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, I'm trying to get another year (of college),'' he joked.
</P>
<P>
   A guy shouldn't have to leave upon finally getting it right.

 &HT;    Cinderella Miami looks ahead
 &HT;    By Marty Williams
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS _ It was fitting that Miami's improbable NCAA
tournament run died under the Gateway Arch.
</P>
<P>
   Wally Szczerbiak was good enough to allow his team to reach the
threshold of the Final Four, but the team couldn't be carried
through by his one-man show.
</P>
<P>
   The RedHawks played three games in the tournament, and
Szczerbiak scored 90 points while hitting just over 53 percent of
his shots.
</P>
<P>
   His teammates scored 85 points and hit just under 33 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In Friday's 58-43 loss to Kentucky in the Midwest Regional
semifinals, Szczerbiak scored 23 points, making eight field goals.
The rest of the RedHawks had 20 points, including six field goals.
</P>
<P>
   In the biggest game of the season, Miami sank to new lows in
field goals (14), shooting percentage (.286) and rebounds (18), and
tied the previous low for points (43).
</P>
<P>
   ``I tried to do what I could to keep us in the game,''
Szczerbiak said, ``but it wasn't enough.''
</P>
<P>
   The 6-foot-8 forward finished his senior year with 775 points,
breaking the school record of 772 set by Ron Harper in 1984-85.
Szczerbiak's career total of 1,847 is second to Harper's 2,377.
</P>
<P>
   In four years, Szczerbiak developed from a scrawny kid no one
wanted to an NBA lottery pick.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't even think about what would have happened if I had
played for another school,'' Szczerbiak said. ``Miami has been
great to me and I'll always be grateful for what the coaches (he
was recruited by Herb Sendek, Charlie Coles' predecessor, and
played for him as a freshman) helped me develop as a player and as
a person. It's been a fun time and I'll leave with my head held
high.''
</P>
<P>
   Coles was obviously disappointed with his team's one-dimensional
performance against Kentucky. ``I had hoped we would play better,
but I hope this doesn't take away from what we accomplished this
season. We had a good run,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Miami was treated royally by the media during the tournament,
and Coles took part of his postgame press conference to express his
appreciation. ``We thank everyone for the attention we got. I hope
we come through this way again some day.''
</P>
<P>
   If that day comes next year, Coles will have orchestrated a
miracle that surpasses anything he accomplished this season.
</P>
<P>
   Szczerbiak, shooting guard Damon Frierson and center John Estick
will graduate. There will be some experienced players returning,
but Coles will have no consistent scoring threats and no quality
size. Mike Ensminger, Rich Allendorf and Jay Locklier, all
sophomores who are 6-8 or taller, have a total of 162 career
points.
</P>
<P>
   Unless Coles scores a recruiting coup, his best big man may be
untested Brian Edwards, a 6-8 sophomore from Detroit who has yet to
play a game. Edwards did not meet academic requirements as a
freshman and was redshirted this year.
</P>
<P>
   And while he is out looking for new talent, Coles is sure he
won't run into UK coach Tubby Smith. When it comes to recruiting,
Kentucky and Miami are in different worlds.
</P>
<P>
   When asked if he had tried to sign any of the current Wildcats,
Coles rolled his eyes and shook his head. ``If I'm in the same gym
as Tubby on a recruiting trip, I'm in the wrong gym.''

 &HT;    Kentucky looks to Padgett
 &HT;    By Marty Williams
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS _ When the game is on the line for the Kentucky
Wildcats, they line up behind Scott Padgett.
</P>
<P>
   UK (28-8), the defending NCAA tournament champion, faces
Michigan State (32-4) today in the Midwest Regional finals.
</P>
<P>
   And if the Wildcats need someone to take charge, Padgett's name
heads the volunteer list.
</P>
<P>
   In last week's 92-88 overtime win over Kansas in New Orleans,
Padgett scored 22 of his career-high 29 points after intermission.
He hit a 3-pointer with 20 seconds left to send the game into OT,
then had seven of the 'Cats 13 points in the extra period.
</P>
<P>
   In Friday's Regional semifinal against Miami, Padgett scored 14
of his 17 points in the second half, including eight in a 10-0 run
that put UK out of reach.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a very competitive person,'' the 6-foot-9 senior said
during Saturday's press gathering at the Trans World Dome. ``I'm
not taking anything away from anyone else on our team, but in
situations like that, you need a veteran to step up. If we need a
play, it's probably going to be me (trying to make it).''
</P>
<P>
   Padgett issued a semi-apology for his behavior during the
semifinals. He hit two treys during the pivotal 10-0 run and each
time pointed at the Miami cheering section.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was mainly for their fans,'' he said sheepishly. ``They
were telling, telling me I was terrible. I just do goofy things on
the court from time to time.''
</P>
<P>
   Padgett had been outscored, 15-3, by Miami's Wally Sczcerbiak in
the first half and that disparity got his juices flowing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think I was embarrassed,'' he said. ``I just got two
silly fouls trying to guard him and that kept me on the bench. I
was happy that I did something to contribute because I hadn't done
much to that point.'' Padgett is a three-year starter, but his UK
career started on a downer as he flunked out of school as a
freshman. He returned to excel in the classroom and on the court.
He was on the Southeastern Conference's all-academic team as a
senior and had a 4.0 grade-point average last semester.
</P>
<P>
   Even though Michigan State is the No. 1 seed here and has won 21
straight games, many analysts favor third-seeded Kentucky because
of the experience factor.
</P>
<P>
   The 'Cats have won two of the last three NCAA tournaments and
finished second in the one they didn't win. The Spartans have made
the 64-team field seven times in the 1990s, but haven't made it to
the Final Four since Magic Johnson led the 1978-79 team to the
title.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think all that stuff is going to have any bearing on
what happens during (today's) game,'' Padgett said. ``Our
experience may have helped us in our preparations because we've
learned how to deal with all the media attention and focus on
getting ready for the games.
</P>
<P>
   ``But that isn't going to mean anything once the game starts.
Then all that's going to matter is who plays the best.''

 &HT;    Georgia women walk over Clemson
 &HT;    By Wendy Parker
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CINCINNATI _ When asked before the Sweet 16 got under way
whether his team could switch gears from its usual high-octane
offensive push into a deliberate, half-court tempo, Georgia coach
Andy Landers didn't hesitate to answer in the affirmative.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, the Lady Bulldogs patiently backed up his
confidence in the second half against Clemson and rolled to a 67-54
victory in the Mideast Regional semifinals.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia (26-6) used a punishing zone defense to keep Clemson
(26-7) to a season-low 33 percent shooting, and held its two top
scorers to only two points combined in the second half.
</P>
<P>
   For the fourth time in the last five seasons and the eighth time
overall, Georgia has reached the Elite 8. The No. 3 seed Lady Dogs
meet fourth-seeded Iowa State, a 64-58 upset winner over top seed
Connecticut, in Monday's Mideast championship game.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a great feeling, but I hope we don't forget that there's
one more game to play for us to reach our goal of getting to the
Final Four,'' said senior guard Pam Irwin-Osbolt, who had 10 points
in a clutch starting role.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia, which has been averaging 82.6 points, shot 46 percent
in the second half. Kelly Miller had 22 points to lead the way, but
the story of this game was how the Lady Dogs dictated from the
defensive end of the floor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to be critical,'' Landers said. ``But their field
goal percentage has been low all season. So we said, `What the
heck, let's pack it in.'''
</P>
<P>
   As in packing in a tight 1-2-2 zone Landers drew up specifically
to limit the Lady Tigers' options on offense. Clemson forward
Natasha Anderson had 12 points to lead her team, but scored just a
deuce in the second half. And hot-shooting guard Amy Geren, who had
10 by halftime, did not score after that.
</P>
<P>
   After trailing 28-26 at halftime, Georgia stayed close over the
first seven minutes. Clemson last took the lead at 44-43, but then
were outscored 12-2 over a 6:05 spurt. Irwin-Obolt's baseline
jumper put the Lady Dogs ahead to stay at 45-44, and they led by as
many as 11 before pulling away.
</P>
<P>
   ``His game plan took away what our strength is,'' Clemson coach
Jim Davis said. ``At the same time, there seemed to be a lid over
the baskets.''

 &HT;    Darlington is a tough egg to crack
 &HT;    By Mark Schlabach
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DARLINGTON, S.C. _ Perhaps there's no other speedway on the
NASCAR circuit with more history and lore than Darlington Raceway,
which is celebrating its 50th anniversary this season.
</P>
<P>
   David Pearson won here a record 10 times, but only three of
Richard Petty's 200 career victories came at Darlington.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, though, there's not an oval of asphalt more
loathed or despised in Winston Cup racing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pro golfers have a choice,'' driver Kyle Petty said. ``If
there is a tournament coming up at a course where they just don't
usually play well or a course that doesn't really suit their games,
they skip it. We don't have that luxury here.''
</P>
<P>
   In NASCAR racing, where every standings point is critical,
Darlington's 1.366-mile, egg-shaped oval demands more of drivers
than any other raceway.
</P>
<P>
   Darlington, the oldest speedway on the circuit, already has
taken its toll. In Friday's qualifying, the fourth turn claimed the
No. 18 Pontiac of Bobby Labonte, which left him with a broken right
shoulder blade in the one-car accident.
</P>
<P>
   ``Darlington is like that old creepy house down the street when
you were a kid,'' driver Ward Burton said. ``It always looked kind
of spooky, but all of those ghost stories couldn't have been true.
The hard part was separating the true ones from the ones somebody
made up. It's the same thing trying to beat those Darlington
ghosts.''
</P>
<P>
   Burton, 10th in the points standings, beat one Saturday. He
overcame the threat of five other drivers and held his 28th-place
effort in qualifying, which gives him the final pit stall on the
front straightaway. Fifteen drivers, including Dale Earnhardt and
Petty, will pit on the backstretch, leaving them a disadvantage on
yellow-flag pit stops.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can win the race from the 28th pit,'' Burton said. ``I'd
say it's darned near impossible from the 29th. A tenth of a second
can be the difference in being able to stop and spend some time in
that victory lane I walk past every morning. I don't know who the
winner will be Sunday, but you can pretty much narrow it down to 28
cars.''
</P>
<P>
   Two-time defending Winston Cup champion Jeff Gordon will start
on the pole and is looking for his sixth win in the last eight
races here. Dale Jarrett, who will start 21st, is the only driver
other than Gordon to win on the track since Sterling Marlin won the
spring race in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``This place is all about carrying speed for 50 or 60 laps on
old tires,'' Gordon said. ``It's old Darlington. The track is very
abrasive and the tires wear out very fast. The pace slows down
tremendously.''

 &HT;    UConn finds alternatives
 &HT;    By Len Pasquarelli
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ With his team's psyche rendered fragile by lofty
expectations for the future and all its well-documented failures of
the past, coach Jim Calhoun employed a sports psychologist last
fall to get inside the craniums of the Connecticut Huskies. The
shrink told the team that, to end the longest streak of Final Four
futility in the history of the NCAA tournament, it might consider
embracing some multiple personalities.
</P>
<P>
   Four months later that analysis paid off, UConn earning its
first Final Four berth here on Saturday by transforming itself into
the basketball equivalent of Sybil. On a day when they shot 35.1
percent, connected on zero three-pointers, watched point guard
Khalid El-Amin miss all 12 of his field goal attempts and put up
the fifth lowest point total of the season, the Huskies found
enough alternatives to defeat surprisingly tough Gonzaga, 67-62,
and capture the West regional.
</P>
<P>
   The victory ended a stretch of 20 straight tournament
appearances without a trip to the Final Four and allowed Calhoun,
who bitterly refers to his media detractors as ``The Horde,'' to
claim the one entry missing from an otherwise sterling resume.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did the things you have to dig down deep to do,'' said
former Westside High School star Ricky Moore, whose exemplary
defense against Bulldogs guards Matt Santangelo and Quentin Hall
was a major element in the victory. ``Especially with Khalid out of
the game, we struggled on the offensive end. But great teams find a
way to win even when they aren't playing great ball, and that's
what we did.''
</P>
<P>
   So suffocating was Connecticut's perimeter defense that
Santangelo and Richie Frahm, the two snipers whose three-point
marksmanship helped catapault Gonzaga to its first Elite Eight
appearance, were a combined three for 20 from the field. Frahm
played with West regional most valuable player Richard Hamilton in
his face most of the day. When he did get an open look, he usually
rushed it.
</P>
<P>
   Santangelo, the Bulldogs' spiritual leader, missed the front end
of a one-on-one that would have tied the game with 1:32 left. Frahm
and Santangelo prefer to use a series of well-designed picks to run
curl cuts and occasionally a fade cut to get open looks at the
hoop. But the Huskies emphasized some hedge techniques and a few
traps to disrupt Gonzaga's offensive flow.
</P>
<P>
   ``(It was) terribly frustrating,'' said Frahm, who scored just
seven points. ``When I came off he pick, it seemed like Hamilton
was always in my face. Those few times he wasn't there and I had an
open look, I was so surprised that I hurried it.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides their defense, it was the Huskies' outstanding board
work that paved the way for their trip to St. Petersburg next
weekend. Connecticut owned a huge 47-33 edge but more significant
was its 21 offensive boards and 42 points in the paint. Although
not a physically imposing outfit, the Huskies made up for a lack of
bulk by being very quick jumpers and finishing off every drive
strong.
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton, who had a game-high 21 points, was able to get to the
hoop anytime he really needed to and forward Kevin Freeman bullied
his way to 15 boards, including 10 at the offensive end. ``They
were piranhas on the boards,'' said Gonzaga coach Dan Monson.

 &HT;    West regional notebook
 &HT;    By Len Pasquarelli
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ One of the advantages Connecticut coach Jim Calhoun
had stressed all season was the presence of two point guards,
Khalid El-Amin and Ricky Moore, in the lineup. On Saturday, the
unusual pairing proved critical for the Huskies.
</P>
<P>
   After picking up two fouls in the game's first four minutes,
El-Amin sat out the rest of the first half and Moore took over at
the point spot. The former standout from Westside School School in
Augusta tallied nine points in the half, dished out three assists
and had no turnovers. But it was Moore's defense against Gonzaga
guard Matt Santangelo that merited the most praise from Calhoun.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's the best man-to-man perimeter defender I've ever
coached,'' Calhoun said. ``When Khalid came here last year, Ricky
had to decide just what kind of player he had to be in our program.
He found the way he would be most valuable to the team. He is a
special kid, one who feels obligated to the program and the
opportunity it has given him.''
</P>
<P>
   In the game's final minutes, Calhoun switched Moore onto Gonzaga
point guard Quentin Hall, whose quickness was creating problems,
and he shut him down as well.
</P>
<P>
   Rough in the diamond
</P>
<P>
   With the slick El-Amin sitting out the final 16 minutes of the
first half, Gonzaga coach Dan Monson played some 2-3 and 1-3-1
zones to try to stymie the Huskies offense and also used the much
shorter Hall (5-foot-8) on UConn star forward Richard Hamilton
(6-foot-6) in a diamond-and-one alignment. The strategy worked for
a while, but it also contributed to the Huskies' dominance in the
paint and on the boards. Hamilton was able to snake into the lane
three times for short jumpers against Hall. ``And anytime you have
to use a 'junk' defense,'' Monson said, ``you're rebounding
suffers.''
</P>
<P>
   Going inside
</P>
<P>
   Trailing 43-41 with 13:5 remaining in the game, UConn bolted to
a 12-4 run and used their quickness off the floor to do so. Jake
Voskuhl scored on a dunk after taking a pass from El-Amin, who had
penetrated into the lane. Then El-Amin was fouled on a drive and
converted one of two free throws. Kevin Freeman went strong to the
hoop to score. El-Amin, fouled on a drive, hit two free throws.
Moore was fouled on a driving layup and converted the three-point
play. Freeman finished the run with a tip-in. ``What they do is
recover quickly and go right back up again,'' Gonzaga center Jeremy
Eaton said. ``It is similar to what they can do to you defensively.
You might think you have a guy beat off the dribble or coming off a
screen, then he's back in your face.''
</P>
<P>
   Notable
</P>
<P>
   Gonzaga was 15-0 this year when shooting better than 45 percent
on three-pointers. The Bulldogs hit just five of 21 treys, however,
on Sunday. In its previous three NCAA victories, Gonzaga shot 56
percent on three-pointers and just 39 percent on two-point tries. .
. . The all-region team was comprised of Hamilton, Freeman and
Moore from UConn and Hall and Casey Calvary of Gonzaga. . . .
Calhoun on Gonzaga: ``They may not have a national name, but
they've got a national game.''

 &HT;    Kenseth beats Cup regulars in 200
 &HT;    By Mark Schlabach
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DARLINGTON, S.C. _ Matt Kenseth will start his second Winston
Cup race today, but the 27-year-old driver held off several NASCAR
stars in Saturday's Diamond Hill Plywood 200 at Darlington Raceway.
</P>
<P>
   Kenseth, who will be the relief driver for Bobby Labonte in
today's TranSouth 400, won his fourth Busch series race.
</P>
<P>
   ``It helped me practicing that Cup car (Saturday) morning,''
Kenseth said, ``and Bobby taught me a few things about the grooves
here. This is a tough place to run your second Cup race, but
they've got a really good car over there.''
</P>
<P>
   Kenseth got a break when a caution flag came out during the
110th lap, when several of the leaders were making a scheduled pit
stop. That left only four cars on the lead lap, including Kenseth,
and most of the former leaders were left one lap down.
</P>
<P>
   Elton Sawyer finished second, and Phil Parsons was third. Terry
Labonte was the highest-finishing Cup regular at fourth. Four of
the top 10 finishers were Cup drivers.

KOSOVO SITUATION WORSENS AS SERBS PRESS OFFENSIVE 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds., this story is now the lead item on NYT Page 1;
EXCLUSIVE-TRIBUNAL-YUGO has dropped to the bottom of the page)  
 (HLW)  
 By JANE PERLEZ   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As hundreds of foreign monitors left Kosovo and
President Clinton met his national security advisers to discuss the
worsening situation there, Serbian forces took advantage of the
vacuum on Saturday to press a heavy offensive against the
separatist Kosovo Liberation Army.
</P>
<P>
   After Clinton met his advisers, a senior official said it
appeared that the Yugoslav leader, Slobodan Milosevic, was
preparing for a major offensive.
</P>
<P>
   In Belgium, Gen. Wesley C. Clark, the supreme commander of NATO,
described the situation in Kosovo in much starker terms. He said in
a telephone interview on Saturday that the offensive was well under
way and that ``all sources indicate that the situation has
dramatically deteriorated on the ground in Kosovo as the verifiers
have departed.''
</P>
<P>
   In Kosovo, thousands of panicked refugees fled their homes, many
for the second time this past week. Reporters who reached the town
of Srbica said Serbian forces dressed in snow-white camouflage and
black masks were seen driving through the streets, with tanks and
troops deployed all around the town, which is in the Drenica
region, the heart of the ethnic Albanians' revolt.
</P>
<P>
   A senior NATO diplomat said Milosevic appeared to be taking
advantage of the departure on Saturday of the international
monitors, sometimes referred to as verifiers, and intensifying an
offensive aimed at crushing the forces of the ethnic Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   At the White House, a day after warning that the Serbs had
crossed the threshold of acceptable behavior, Clinton met with
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright; Defense Secretary William
Cohen; Gen. Henry H. Shelton, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of
Staff; George Tenet, the director of central intelligence; and
Sandy Berger, the national security adviser.
</P>
<P>
   The senior administration official who briefed reporters said
that Clinton was ``deeply concerned'' about the situation. There
were ``confirmed reports of the outbreak of violence,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   At NATO, the senior diplomat described about 5,000 Yugoslav
troops in the field in Kosovo and many more units pouring into the
southern Serbian province, as the 1,300 monitors of the
Organization for Security and Co-Operation in Europe were leaving.
</P>
<P>
   NATO officials said it appeared that Milosevic was making good
on a statement made to a number of Western officials in the last
months: That it would take him from five to seven days to ``finish
off'' the Kosovo Liberation Army if he was allowed to do so.
</P>
<P>
   At his news conference on Friday, Clinton said NATO allies were
prepared to act against the Serbs. But he declined to set out a
timetable or indicate when enough was enough from Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   NATO officials said on Saturday that air strikes could begin as
soon as Secretary-General Janvier Solana, who has been authorized
to give the go-ahead to Clark, had consulted with all 16 allies.
</P>
<P>
   But that process could take some days. Consultation would not
begin at least until after a meeting scheduled for Sunday of the 16
NATO ambassadors at NATO headquarters in Brussels, the officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   The NATO diplomat said that now that the international monitors
had left, the West had to bear the consequences of Milosevic's
stepped up military activity. ``Until now the question of air
strikes has only been theoretical,'' the diplomat said. ``It's like
being on the edge of the diving board and it's another thing to
pluck up the courage to go into the water.''
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, a senior administration official involved in
Kosovo policy said that the administration was still discussing
sending another American emissary to Milosevic in Belgrade. It was
not decided who that emissary would be, the official said. Richard
Holbrooke, who has often been sent to the Balkans as a special
envoy, was sent 10 days ago to Belgrade and came away empty-handed.
</P>
<P>
   The visit to Washington on Tuesday by the Russian prime
minister, Yevgany Primakov, remained a factor in deciding the
timetable for any air strikes, the policy maker said.
</P>
<P>
   Several NATO officials expressed frustration on Saturday at the
advantage Milosevic had commanded for himself.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic's troops had made a ``horseshoe'' encirclement of
Kosovo from the north to the south, one said. Serbian troops were
well into the Drenica region, the heartland of the Kosovo
Liberation Army, he added.
</P>
<P>
   The NATO officials described the history of the threats made by
the alliance but not carried out against Milsoevic since last
summer when Serbian forces embarked on a major offensive against
the ethnic Albanian guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
   The first major threat, they recounted, was last October, after
a massacre of civilians. Then, Holbrooke was sent to Belgrade and
NATO planes were poised ready to strike until, at the 11th hour,
Milosevic agreed to a cease-fire and to certain troop withdrawals.
</P>
<P>
   In January, Milosevic's forces committed another massacre
against ethnic Albanian civilians at the village of Racak. Clark
and another top NATO military officer were sent to Belgrade to tell
Milosevic to desist but, according to accounts by Clark afterward,
Milosevic remained defiant.
</P>
<P>
   Then, NATO officials recounted, Albright mounted a diplomatic
campaign to get Solana the authorization to bomb targets in Kosovo
and Serbia if Milosevic did not stop his aggression and bring his
troops back to the levels agreed in October.
</P>
<P>
   But, simultaneously, peace talks were organized in France. All
through the talks, the rationale for bombing was that Milosevic had
to be brought to the peace table. But now that the talks have
collapsed, the rationale has been changed, one NATO diplomat said,
to hitting Milosevic's troops and thus restraining their ability to
attack the ethnic Albanians.

WOMEN'S GAME NOT SECOND-CLASS ANYMORE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The First Lady was considered a second-class
athlete. Hillary Clinton grew up playing half-court basketball, an
inane exercise of temperance. ``We weren't allowed to play
full-court like the boys,'' she recently told an esteemed gathering
of women athletes at the White House, ``because we were told our
hearts were too weak.''
</P>
<P>
   The First Lady Techster was considered a second-class coach.
When Sonja Hogg attended a coaching clinic after launching the
Louisiana Tech women's program in the early 1970s, she was the only
woman in a room of 300-something participants.
</P>
<P>
   Indiana coach Bob Knight, a guest speaker not known for his
broad-mindedness, singled her out to demonstrate a defensive drill,
clearly aiming to humiliate her. Instead, Hogg walked away from the
challenge validated, with a standing ovation from the roomful of
men ringing in her ears.
</P>
<P>
   That was then. Now the issue isn't the acceptance of female
coaches or the stamina of female basketball players, it's the
stature of their sport. Over the past few years the women's game
has grown like a muscle on steroids. From Ames to Westwood the
players' drawing power is becoming so pronounced, some will tell
you it's strong enough to lift the game to Herculean heights.
</P>
<P>
   Don't let all the empty seats at the Sports Arena, site of this
weekend's NCAA Tournament West Regional, give you the wrong
impression. Louisiana Tech, which played intrastate rival Louisiana
State in the first semifinal, has standing-room-only crowds in its
8,000-seat arena. UCLA, which played Colorado State in the second
game, drew 9,530 for a game against rival USC in January, which is
bigger than six of the eight Clippers crowds at the Sports Arena
this season.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere, Iowa State attracted 24,000 to its first two
tournament games at home and Colorado State has raised its average
attendance over the past five years from relatives and friends to
more than 4,000. Then there's the Tennessee women's team, which
averaged 17,568 fans at its home games this season, the
fifth-highest number in the nation for any program, men's or
women's.
</P>
<P>
   All of which has got the sport's guardians to thinking. Later
this year they will debate whether or not to scrap every last
home-court game in the first and second rounds of the NCAA Division
I Tournament in favor of the neutral-sites format employed to such
grand effect by the men.
</P>
<P>
   Advocates of the move will tell you the timing never has been
better. How much more validation does women's basketball need than
one of its own (Tennessee's Chamique Holdsclaw) beating out Heisman
Trophy winner Ricky Williams for the prestigious Sullivan Award,
given each year to the country's top amateur athlete?
</P>
<P>
   ``The way women's basketball is being perceived around the
country shows we are ready,'' said Sue Gunter, Louisiana State's
17-year coach. ``To really give the credibility to the women's game
we need to go to the neutral sites. That's going to be a sign that
our game has truly arrived.''
</P>
<P>
   The dissenters, who include former UCLA great Ann Meyers
Drysdale, wonder if women's basketball isn't like the proverbial
kid sister, so hell-bent on catching up to her older brother that
she forgets to forge her own identity.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't financially support teams playing at eight neutral
sites like the men do,'' Meyers Drysdale said. ``It is important to
keep building fan support by having the top teams playing in their
geographic regions.''
</P>
<P>
   Home teams won all 32 games in the first week and therein lies
the rub. Among the schools that some would argue gained an unfair
competitive advantage playing in familiar surroundings was UCLA,
the No.3 seed in the West. The Bruins beat Wisconsin-Green Bay and
Kentucky at Pauley Pavilion to reach the semifinals at the Sports
Arena 10 miles down the road.
</P>
<P>
   Both of Saturday's games at host USC's site were televised to a
cable audience. That was the good news. The bad news was they were
shoehorned between sundown and the stroke of midnight, local time.
</P>
<P>
   What price exposure?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's ridiculous,'' Gunter conceded during a press conference
on the eve of Saturday's game. ``But if we want TV exposure, we
seem to be at their mercy.''
</P>
<P>
   At that point, one of Gunter's players, Katrina Hibbert, cleared
her throat and proceeded to remind everybody in the room why
women's basketball is worth loving. The women's sound fundamentals
notwithstanding, there's the matter of their unspoiled grace.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't really matter,'' Hibbert said of the late starting
times. ``I'm just happy to be playing.''
</P>
<P>
   To have a similar appreciation of where women's basketball is
headed, a refresher course on its humble beginnings is instructive.
Take the Louisiana Tech team, for example, the most storied of the
four programs in the West Regional.
</P>
<P>
   The Lady Techsters are one of only two schools (Tennessee is the
other) to have appeared in the NCAA Tournament all 18 years of its
existence. Sixteen times they have advanced at least as far as the
Sweet 16. Ten times they have reached the Final Four and they have
won three national championships _ the first two under Hogg and the
third under her one-time assistant Leon Barmore, the only other
head coach the program has had.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were averaging 5,000 fans when nobody else was drawing
300,'' Hogg, now the Baylor women's coach, said from Waco. ``I
think the uniqueness of it was the drawing point, at first. But you
can only sell the uniqueness of it for so long. You have to have a
good product to keep people coming back.''
</P>
<P>
   Hogg's father had been a left-handed pitcher and road roommate
of Stan Musial on the St. Louis Cardinals. Perhaps that had
something to do with the quality of the pitch she delivered in 1973
to Louisiana Tech president Dr. F. Jay Taylor. Upon hearing her
ideas on starting a women's basketball team, he gave her the
go-ahead and a $5,000 budget.
</P>
<P>
   Money was tighter than spandex in the early years. The Lady
Techsters rode to away games on a rickety bus they affectionately
called the Blue Goose. ``We'd have to push the thing half the time
to make it start,'' Hogg said.
</P>
<P>
   They would travel to neutral sites _ New Orleans was a favorite
_ and play three teams in one day to cut down on traveling costs.
Programs everywhere were pinching their pennies. So when teams came
to rural Ruston to play Louisiana Tech, Hogg thought nothing of
lending them a university bus to use during their stay. Sometimes
she'd even take their dirty uniforms home after a game and wash
them so they'd be fresh for the next stop on the trip.
</P>
<P>
   Nowadays, teams travel by plane and stay at four-star hotels and
have all the free sneakers they can wear out. Agents and a few
unsavory club coaches are creeping into the picture. The
camaraderie of the early years has been replaced by a cut-throat
competitiveness.
</P>
<P>
   Hogg watches her baby grow up and, like any guardian, frets. ``I
don't want women's basketball to get to the point where we don't
have integrity,'' she said. ``Where it's winning at all costs.'' &QL;

US SPYING THREATENS N-PLANT MONITORING WORLDWIDE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By COLUM LYNCH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The monitoring system being installed worldwide to
ensure that nuclear power plants are not used illicitly to make
nuclear weapons materials was designed with the help of a former US
intelligence officer who allegedly rigged a similar system to spy
on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   The disclosure is raising fears that countries may refuse to
accept the monitoring program for fear the information will be
funneled back to the US government. And it threatens to frustrate
the efforts of the International Atomic Energy Agency to broaden
its scrutiny of weapons development projects in North Korea and
Iran.
</P>
<P>
   The secret involvement of US intelligence agents in the UN
effort to track down hidden Iraqi nuclear, chemical and biological
weapons became a major embarrassment for the United Nations.
Disarmament specialists said the revelations could undermine one of
the pillars of US arms control policy: a decades-long campaign to
persuade countries to open their nuclear, biological and chemical
weapons facilities to international scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a major setback,'' said Spurgeon Keeny, a former US
arms control negotiator who has pressed for decades for aggressive
spot checks of the world's deadliest arms stockpiles. ``Nobody who
is really cheating is going to be willing to permit intrusive,
on-site inspections. But this gives them a built-in excuse.''
</P>
<P>
   The US official is a career Air Force intelligence specialist
who led a group of Americans that built the UN remote video
surveillance system to monitor Iraqi facilities capable of
developing chemical and biological weapons, according to US and UN
officials. A senior Pentagon official, voicing concern for the
official's safety, requested that his name not be published.
</P>
<P>
   Rolf Ekeus, the former chief of the UN Special Commission
(UNSCOM) in Iraq, described the official as a ``creative''
troubleshooter who rigged an effective communications system under
highly difficult and hostile conditions.
</P>
<P>
   But the team, which included two CIA operatives, secretly
installed microwave eavesdropping devices into the system in the
mid-1990s that picked up Iraqi communications between military
bases throughout the country, the Washington Post reported.
</P>
<P>
   The March 2 report was confirmed by a US source familiar with
the operation. A senior Pentagon official declined to confirm or
deny the report.
</P>
<P>
   An UNSCOM official, speaking on condition of anonymity,
described the Air Force officer as ``a loose cannon.'' Particularly
galling, the official said, was the public disclosure on an Air
Force intelligence web site of his role in analyzing raw data from
the UN monitoring system. UNSCOM demanded that the US government
remove the information, and it was taken off the site.
</P>
<P>
   ``The concern was that it looked like this was a US operation,''
said another UNSCOM source.
</P>
<P>
   The Globe has learned that the official has since gone to Vienna
to create a low cost, remote monitoring system for the
International Atomic Energy Agency. There is no evidence that the
new system also would pick up microwave communications between
military bases.
</P>
<P>
   In an telephone interview from his office in Vienna, the
official denied that he had spied in Iraq. He said that he was
always under the scrutiny of his Iraqi handlers. He also said that
he is not spying at his new atomic agency post.
</P>
<P>
   ``My role is clean,'' he said. ``I don't do anything that is not
approved.''
</P>
<P>
   Bruno Pellaud, the Swiss deputy director general for safeguards
at the IAEA, said he believes the American.
</P>
<P>
   He said the American communications expert came to work for him
two years ago to help establish a remote monitoring system that
will enable the agency to monitor nuclear power facilities around
the globe from the organization's Vienna headquarters through video
cameras and radio sensors.
</P>
<P>
   Pellaud and other agency officials said they recently became
aware of the report that the official had spied in Iraq. But
Pellaud said the American remains a key member of the team.
</P>
<P>
   With his help, the agency has established remote monitoring
systems at nuclear power stations in Switzerland, South Africa and
Japan. And the agency is negotiating with Iran and North Korea,
both suspected by US intelligence of having sought to develop
nuclear weapons, to install similar monitoring systems in their
nuclear power plants.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have intensified our efforts to expand the use of remote
monitoring in nuclear facilities around the world because of the
potential for cost-saving,'' said Pellaud. ``Instead of sending
inspectors, we have the privilege to have cameras permanently
installed so we can draw a picture every hour.''
</P>
<P>
   Senior US officials expressed concern that charges of American
spying in Iraq may prompt countries to backtrack on their
commitments to grant future access to international inspectors.
</P>
<P>
   At stake are longstanding US efforts to halt the spread of
nuclear weapons, freeze the production of scores of chemical and
biological warfare agents from Iraq to India, and eliminate
millions of gallons of dangerous nerve agent stockpiles in the
United States, Russia and China.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am worried that some of these allegations will lead to
reluctance on the part of some countries to accept intrusive
inspections,'' a senior US official said. ``I'm worried the
credibility of some organizations will be unfairly damaged.''
</P>
<P>
   Richard Butler, the executive chairman of UNSCOM, added that the
reports of espionage was likely to heighten suspicions in other
agencies that hunt for hidden weapons.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest nightmare of any treaty partner is that one of its
members will cheat from within,'' Butler said during a recent
speech at the Council on Foreign Relations.
</P>
<P>
   Their concerns appear to be well founded.
</P>
<P>
   Disarmament specialists and other political analysts now assume
that international inspectors from most countries, whether they are
spies or not, routinely report back to their governments on
confidential information they pick up on the job.
</P>
<P>
   ``To a certain degree it's taken for granted that countries take
this information back home,'' said Eric Croddy, a chemical weapons
expert from the Monterrey Institute, a think tank specializing in
arms control.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know whether that is a good thing or a bad thing that
our taxpayer dollars go to fund these things,'' he added. ``Many of
our spies are terrible scientists.''
</P>
<P>
   Ambassador John Ritch, the US representative to the IAEA, said
that he has been ``scrupulous'' in ensuring the atomic agency's
reputation for independence remains ``pristine.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that in judging the IAEA, a voluntary arms control
agency, by the standards of the UN inspection operation in Iraq, is
unfair.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't consider what we did in Iraq was arms control,'' he
said. ``I consider it the disarmament of a defeated aggressor.''
</P>
<P>
   Donato Kiniger-Passigli, the Italian spokesman of the
Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, and the
IAEA's Pellaud said that while many of the agencies' inspectors
have been recruited from UNSCOM, they do not use the
confrontational tactics employed by UNSCOM, which included a covert
UN intelligence operation in its inspections.
</P>
<P>
   IAEA and the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical
Weapons are working with countries that are voluntarily granting
access to their nuclear and chemical facilities, the spokesmen
said.
</P>
<P>
   Kiniger-Passigli said that while his organization freely accepts
offers of intelligence from its members, his organization has
imposed rigorous guidelines to ensure that inspectors don't report
sensitive information back to their home countries.
</P>
<P>
   ``They work for us and only for us,'' he insisted, referring to
the agency's 205 international inspectors.

KNICKS MIRED IN SOAP OPERA
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ As if the Evander Holyfield-Lennox Lewis travesty
weren't enough to keep the New York tabloids busy, they set their
cynical eye on an even easier target this week: the Knicks.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, the lovable group that managed to score five points in a
quarter and 22 in a half against the Chicago Bulls, the NBA's
version of the Washington Generals. Or is that the Clippers?
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, New York was aflutter for about one news cycle with
reports that coach Jeff Van Gundy was about to be fired if he
didn't beat Charlotte.
</P>
<P>
   Well, Van Gundy's job was never in jeopardy, but more intriguing
than the job rumors were the theories on who was spreading this
gossip.
</P>
<P>
   The No.1 culprit is Knicks general manager Ernie Grunfeld,
hoping to deflect some criticism from his own questionable
personnel moves by stabbing a co-worker in the back. New Yorkers
haven't been thrilled Ernie G. traded the popular Charles Oakley
for Marcus Camby, or signed invisible point guard Chris Childs to a
six-year, $24 million contract.
</P>
<P>
   So maybe he planted the rumor to see what the players really
thought of Van Gundy, hoping to make him the fall guy before MSG
president Dave Checketts decided Ernie has to go, which is much
more likely to happen.
</P>
<P>
   Let's face it, if the Knicks make a coaching change and hire
Phil Jackson, the former Bulls coach will also want to make
personnel moves, eliminating the need for Grunfeld.
</P>
<P>
   ``The surprise to me is Ernie's still here. That's the biggest
surprise to me. He's got everybody fooled. I don't know how the
city contends with this,'' said former Knick Anthony Mason. ``I
guess him and Dave (Checketts) are like this'' as he crossed his
fingers.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Van Gundy has tried to take the rumors of his
demise in stride.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thank God basketball season has started in New York. The first
year, (the job security questions started) right after I got the
job,'' he said. ``The second year it was 12 games, the third year
it was 15. They waited too long this year.''
</P>
<P>
   This being New York, there are also has been speculation that
maybe even Van Gundy planted the stories himself, desperate to do
something after the Knicks tied the league record for least field
goals made (19)in that 76-63 loss to the Bulls.
</P>
<P>
   If he did, it worked. The Knicks have won three of four since
the news broke and Van Gundy has received undying support from his
players.
</P>
<P>
   ``They can trade me if they do it,'' center Patrick Ewing said.
</P>
<P>
   That should keep Van Gundy's job safe _ for at least a couple of
more weeks.
</P>
<P>
   They're shocked, simply shocked: If you think the Chicago Bulls
had an office pool on how long it would take Dennis Rodman to go
AWOL in L.A., you wouldn't be far from the truth.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not surprised to see this,'' Bulls guard Ron Harper said.
``A cat cannot change its fur. A sheep cannot change into a cow.''
</P>
<P>
   Rookie of the year: The old joke used to go ``Who's the only guy
who held Michael Jordan under 20 points? Dean Smith.''
</P>
<P>
   The joke is just as relevant today, just insert the names Vince
Carter and Bill Guthridge.
</P>
<P>
   Carter, who played in the shadow of Antawn Jamison last season
at North Carolina, has emerged as the early front-runner for rookie
of the year honors. On Thursday the Raptors' rookie scored 17 of
his game- and career-high 28 points in the fourth quarter to lead
Toronto to a 103-101 victory over Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   Then he lit up the Clippers for 26 points, making 10 of 11
shots.
</P>
<P>
   ``Vince Carter is a very gifted player who has a great future in
this league,'' said the normally reserved Joe Dumars.
</P>
<P>
   No Cal diet: New Jersey players were all smiles when the Nets
fired John Calipari, who was viewed more as a self-promoter than a
coach.
</P>
<P>
   But now that the slick-haired huckster is gone, will they be a
better team?
</P>
<P>
   The Nets' demise might be traced to Calipari, but most league
observers view them as one of the most selfish teams in the league,
with even bona-fide stars Kerry Kittles and Keith Van Horn earning
reputations as ball hogs.
</P>
<P>
   Management hopes newly acquired Stephon Marbury will have more
effect on team chemistry than any possible replacement for
Calipari.
</P>
<P>
   The feudin' may be over: Penny Hardaway keeps dredging up his
hard feelings toward Orlando coach Chuck Daly over the way he was
treated when he was injured last season.
</P>
<P>
   Daly ``was so upset that I didn't play, he didn't speak to me.
He didn't even want to see me. If I couldn't play on the team, he
didn't care... I never had one negative thing to say about Chuck
Daly. He's only had negative things to say about Penny Hardaway.''
</P>
<P>
   Daly's response: ``As a coach, you have to take the people who
are available and work your (butt) off to try to win a game and
that's what we tried to do. I couldn't do anything about the fact
Penny was injured... you've just got to move on and try to work
with the people you have.''
</P>
<P>
   The two then held a meeting to go over their differences and
Hardaway seems satisfied.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had one of the best conversations I've ever had with a
coach,'' Hardaway said. ``There had been a lot of assumptions made
on both sides. I don't think Chuck realized how important this was
to me. I could have used his support last year, but that's over
now. I feel like we have a good line of communication now and I can
go talk to him anytime.'' &QL;

TIME TO LOOK AHEAD FOR PAC-10
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ Long gone from the NCAA Tournament _ but alive and
well in the NIT _ the Pacific-10 looks to next season. For the
first time in several years, there won't be an odds-on favorite.
</P>
<P>
   Here's one scenario, from bottom to top:
</P>
<P>
   10. Washington State. The Cougars will have a new coach, but the
same frustrating results: They're not good enough to beat the elite
teams at home, and they can't beat anyone on the road.
</P>
<P>
   Kab Kazadi and Kojo Mensah-Bonsu do not return, a relief to
public-address announcers everywhere, but Reseda's Eddie Miller and
sharpshooter Jan-Michael Thomas are back. Combined with several
decent recruits, they will help Wazu to respectability. Projected
Pac-10 record: 5-13.
</P>
<P>
   9. Washington. After coach Bob Bender bolts for Vanderbilt, the
Huskies will hire Colorado State's rising star, Ritchie McKay. He
doesn't have much to work with _ Donald Watts and Todd MacCulloch
are gone _ as Washington returns to the second-division status it
held for much of the decade.
</P>
<P>
   Point guard Senque Carey and shooter Deon Luton form a solid
backcourt, but the frontcourt players (Chris Walcott, Greg Clark,
Marlon Shelton and Thalo Green) are unproven. Pac-10 record: 6-12.
</P>
<P>
   8. Arizona State. Coach Rob Evans enters the second phase of his
rebuilding job: Having lost all-conference players Bobby Lazor and
Mike Batiste, he must survive until his recruits mature.
</P>
<P>
   Point guard Alton Mason and shooter Eddie House are the top
returnees. Illinois transfer Awvee Storey and incoming freshman
Donnell Knight will start. There's no proven center. Pac-10 record:
7-11.
</P>
<P>
   7. California. The good news for coach Ben Braun is
underachieving gunners Thomas Kilgore and Geno Carlisle are gone.
They will leave a less talented _ but more cohesive _ group. Watch
for forward Sean Lampley to emerge as one of the league's best.
He'll be the first option, with recruit Donte Smith and small
forward Carl Boyd in support. Pac-10 record: 7-11.
</P>
<P>
   6. Oregon State. Beware the Beavs. They're ready to dominate at
home and perhaps win a road game or two. Coach Eddie Payne has his
core intact: guards Dino Tanner and Josh Steinthal, forwards
Clifton Jones and Ramunas Petraitis, plus center Jason Heide and
6-9 recruit Brian Jackson, the best big man Payne has ever signed.
</P>
<P>
   Success may be their biggest problem: No one will take them for
granted. Pac-10 record: 8-10.
</P>
<P>
   5. USC. The Trojans showed glimpses of potential this season
against UCLA and Stanford. Inexperience was a problem, but that
shouldn't be true next season.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Henry Bibby has the players to challenge for an NCAA bid:
Brandon Granville at point, Jeff Trepagnier on the wing, Sam
Clancy, Jarvis Turner, Greg Lakey and Brian Scalabrine up front.
Pac-10 record: 10-8.
</P>
<P>
   4. Oregon. Consider Oregon's charge through the NIT as the
beginning of its 1999-2000 season. With most of their top players
returning, the Ducks will be one of the Pac-10's best and a solid
NCAA Tournament team. Point guard Darius Wright returns, as do
gifted wing players Alex Scales and Freddie Jones.
</P>
<P>
   A.D. Smith is a solid power forward, but as usual, there's no
proven center. Ernie Kent's motion offense can score against
anyone, but to consistently beat the elite he'll need a junior
college big man. Pac-10 record: 11-7.
</P>
<P>
   3. UCLA. Bruins coach Steve Lavin won't have inexperience to
blame if UCLA struggles in conference play. Everyone of consequence
returns but All-American Baron Davis, who's expected to bolt for
the NBA. While he'll be a major loss, the Bruins should have enough
size, depth and talent to maintain their upper-division status.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins must shift their emphasis to a half-court attack for
two reasons: Point guard Earl Watson is not a dependable ball
handler in transition, and that style would make better use of the
big men, Jerome Moiso and Dan Gadzuric. Now the question becomes:
Can the coaching staff teach a consistent, effective halfcourt
system? Pac-10 record: 13-5.
</P>
<P>
   1. Arizona (tie). The Wildcats lose guard Jason Terry and center
A.J. Bramlett, but everyone else returns, including Loren Woods, a
7-foot transfer from Wake Forest. Arizona also welcomes recruit
Jason Gardner, one of the nation's top point guard recruits, to
replace Terry.
</P>
<P>
   The wing and forward positions are excellent, with sophomores
Ruben Douglas, Richard Jefferson, Rick Anderson and Michael Wright.
But like UCLA this season, the Wildcats won't have many juniors and
seniors in the rotation. Pac-10 record: 14-4.
</P>
<P>
   1. Stanford (tie). Yes, the Cardinal loses four starters, but it
has enough incoming talent to avoid a rebuilding season. Mark
Madsen returns at power forward and should be the best big man in
the league. He's joined by Jarron and (if healthy) Jason Collins,
plus Mike McDonald, Ryan Mendez and Davis Moseley.
</P>
<P>
   The recruiting class is the nation's best, led by Glendora
shooting guard Casey Jacobsen, Alameda power forward Justin Davis,
and Redmond (Wash.) center Curtis Borchardt, the best incoming big
man in the league.
</P>
<P>
   After an injured-filled season, coach Mike Montgomery will have
all the depth he needs next year. Pac-10 record: 14-4. &QL;

ONLY 30 REMAIN WITH UFO CULT LEADER IN NEW LOCATION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By Barry Shlachter 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   What does a cult leader do when his grand prophecies fall flat?
</P>
<P>
   In the case of Chen Hon-ming of Taiwan, who predicted last year
that God would appear on cable TV and then materialize in Chen's
image on a lawn in Garland, Texas, he issues a sweeping new
revelation and relocates to upstate New York.
</P>
<P>
   But 12 months later, only 30 of his 160 followers are still with
him.
</P>
<P>
   To make matters worse, two of Chen's closest lieutenants have
dropped out of the Taiwanese UFO cult, as the news media dubbed his
Way of Truth sect, which mixes Christianity and Buddhism with a
belief in flying saucers.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the setback, a spokesman said Chen stands by his
prediction of a nuclear holocaust in Asia and Europe between Oct. 1
and Dec. 31 while divine UFOs evacuate worthy believers to the
safety of the Great Lakes region. Chen considers the region sacred.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have full belief and faith in God, in God's salvation,''
said the spokesman, Richard Liu, who confirmed that Chen still
considers himself the reincarnation of Joseph, Jesus Christ's
father.
</P>
<P>
   Liu, 40, formerly an English professor in Taiwan, said the
sect's remnants have settled comfortably in Lockport, N.Y., 30
miles south of Niagara Falls. The members' children are attending
public schools, and the parents have become more involved in
community affairs than they were in Garland, he said.
</P>
<P>
   An official of the Chamber of Commerce in Lockport, a town of
29,000 noted as the starting point of the Erie Canal and the
hometown of model Kim Alexis, said sect members have made hardly a
ripple in the Rust Belt industrial city, which otherwise has few
ethnic Chinese residents.
</P>
<P>
   As in Texas, the group released color snapshots of what appeared
to be jet contrails in the sky and said they were left by God's
UFOs.
</P>
<P>
   But Chen has not taken the defection of his key followers
lightly.
</P>
<P>
   In angry, open letters to President Clinton and Taiwan's
President Lee Teng-hui released last week, Chen accuses the sect's
former No. 2 leader of trying to disrupt the group through lies,
blackmail and insults.
</P>
<P>
   The defector, Chiang Chin-hung, formerly a career official of
Taiwan's Bureau of Investigation, called the allegations
ridiculous.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking through an interpreter from his Garland home, Chiang
said he is planning to return soon to Taiwan. ``I and others just
want to live a normal life without being bothered by the media,''
he said.

EX-WIFE: GUNMAN CARED FOR HOMELESS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD RUELAS  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Brian Ball opened fire on Tempe police officers arresting a
homeless man Friday, he was armed with more than a gun.
</P>
<P>
   He also carried a soft spot for the downtrodden and a disdain
for police, his ex-wife of six years said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``That just sounds like something Brian would do,'' said
Michelle Grimes, Ball's former wife, speaking from Hawaii.
</P>
<P>
   The gunfire critically wounded a Tempe officer _ also,
ironically, a friend of the homeless _ and caused Ball's death as
the police returned fire.
</P>
<P>
   But the seemingly senseless act made sense to Grimes. She said
Ball was a delusional, alcoholic drug abuser and gun enthusiast who
also had a fondness for the homeless that went way back.
</P>
<P>
   He was sympathetic to them, she said, because he grew up in a
poor family.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'd be on the street himself if he didn't have friends,'' she
said. ``He spent all his money on drugs and booze.''
</P>
<P>
   Ball once brought a homeless man home to Grimes' luxury
townhouse for Thanksgiving dinner.
</P>
<P>
   ``He called him Jesus,'' Grimes said.
</P>
<P>
   Grimes, a scuba instructor in Kailua, Hawaii, divorced Ball in
1995, ending their turbulent relationship.
</P>
<P>
   Grimes said Ball would go through phases when he would pretend
he was a different person _ walking like rock star Jim Morrison or
shaving his head and talking like Marlon Brando.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mom thought he was nice when he was sober, but I don't
remember him being nice. That's not what I think of when I think of
Brian.''
</P>
<P>
   Ball was a big talker who would get kicked out of bars for
threatening strangers, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'd come up to people and say, `I'm going to kill you,' and
he wouldn't even know who they were,'' Grimes said. ``He had an
evil face he would give people, like a drunk and evil thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Ball got violent with Grimes only once _ cocking a gun during an
argument.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said, `What did you say?' and pulled back on the trigger,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Just after midnight Friday, Ball stepped out of his pickup truck
and opened fire at the arresting officers.
</P>
<P>
   Tempe police could not fathom why.
</P>
<P>
   Dave Vanlandingham, 22, the homeless man who was arrested, said
Ball likely heard him shouting that his arrest was unfair.
</P>
<P>
   ``He probably saw me protesting my arrest verbally,''
Vanlandingham said, squatting Saturday on a planter outside the
post office about a block from the shooting scene.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was sticking up for myself, saying, `It's a public street.
How can I get arrested for standing on a public street?' '' said
Vanlandingham, who moved from Seattle to Tempe in November.
</P>
<P>
   Vanlandingham, called ``Yogi'' on the street, said Ball shot at
the officers to the side of him, guarding the scene, and he never
felt in danger.
</P>
<P>
   Sgt. John Schaper, 33, a 12-year veteran, was listed in critical
condition Saturday at Maricopa Medical Center after a two-hour
surgery to repair the damage of a bullet that fragmented in his
abdomen, according to a Tempe police spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Schaper is known as a nice guy on Mill Avenue. Several ``Mill
Rats,'' the nickname given to the scruffy youngsters who panhandle
along the east side of Mill Avenue, said Schaper is sympathetic to
their plight.
</P>
<P>
   Seth Gates, 24, said he knew of at least one person Schaper took
home for a meal and a shower. Gates said Schaper didn't harass the
slackers along the avenue.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was one of the good ones,'' Gates said.
</P>
<P>
   Schaper's family couldn't be reached Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The other officer who took one of Ball's bullets, Charles
Bridges, was shot in the chest, but the shell bounced off his body
armor. The other arresting officer was Steve Smith. It was Smith
and Bridges who returned the gunfire, killing Ball.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm surprised he lasted this long, really,'' Grimes said of
Ball. ``He would do such daring things.''
</P>
<P>
   She filed for a restraining order and then, months later, filed
for divorce. After Grimes moved to Hawaii, Ball sent her a letter
threatening to kill her family, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He even told me exactly how he was going to kill my mother,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   When Grimes knew Ball he worked as a maintenance man at an
apartment complex by day and haunted bars in north Phoenix and
downtown Tempe at night.
</P>
<P>
   He would often go off on benders that would last several days.
</P>
<P>
   ``He would just, like, wake up in the middle of the yard, or
church, or somebody's front doorstep,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Grimes, who met Ball through a blind date, said she got married
to him because she was young and ``clingy.'' Ball, she said, was
also very handsome.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I was never attracted to his personality, ever.'' &QL;

LEAFS BEAT DEVILS, 4-1  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By ALEX YANNIS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO _ The Devils have their sights on several targets with
less than a month left in the regular season. They want to finish
first in the Eastern Conference, gain the home ice advantage for
the playoffs and pocket the gate receipts that come with it, but
they also want to capture their third consecutive divisional title
and break the league record for road victories.
</P>
<P>
   Their sights were temporarily obstructed Saturday night in a 3-1
loss to the Toronto Maple Leafs at Air Canada Center. The loss,
which gave the Devils a 4-1 record on their five-game trip,
weakened their quest in every category, especially their desire to
set the record for road victories.
</P>
<P>
   The Devils, now 38-22-8, never found a rhythm against the Maple
Leafs. They were sloppy on defense and showed little coordination
in the offensive zone. They had just two legitimate chances in the
scoreless first period, and were completely outplayed in the
second, when Toronto scored its goals.
</P>
<P>
   Fredrik Modin, who returned to action after fracturing a
collarbone Feb. 13, put the Maple Leafs on the right path with his
13th goal of the season just 55 seconds into the second period. He
beat Martin Brodeur from the slot with a shot that appeared to
bounce off one of the Devils.
</P>
<P>
   Brodeur, who was making his 11th consecutive start, also found
himself helpless on the second goal, which Stevie Sullivan scored 5
minutes 50 seconds into the period from the bottom of the left
circle. Sullivan converted Mike Johnson's pass from the other side.
</P>
<P>
   Todd Warriner scored the Maple Leafs' third goal with 10:58 left
in the period. It was the first time that the Devils allowed more
than two goals on this trip.
</P>
<P>
   The Devils' Brendan Morrison scored his 12th goal of the season
at 6:49 of the third period.
</P>
<P>
   With the loss, the Devils fell one victory short of sweeping a
five-game trip for the first time in their history. It put the
Devils at 24-9-2 on the road and left them four victories short of
eclipsing the Montreal Canadiens' record of 27, set during the
1976-77 season.
</P>
<P>
   The Devils have six road games left, against Florida,
Pittsburgh, Carolina, Montreal, Buffalo and Nashville.
</P>
<P>
   A 4-2 triumph over the Islanders at Nassau Coliseum on March 7
started the trip. It continued with a 3-2 victory in Pittsburgh
before the Devils went to western Canada for a 2-1 triumph in
Vancouver last Monday and a 4-1 trouncing of Edmonton on Wednesday
night.
</P>
<P>
   Even though they lost their captain, Scott Stevens, in the early
stages of the game in Vancouver, the Devils' defense has performed
effectively. Brad Bombardir stepped in as Scott Niedermayer's
partner on defense and, according to the assistant coach Jacques
Caron, played his best hockey in the game in Edmonton.
</P>
<P>
   Stevens strained his groin in Vancouver and returned home to
rest. He worked out lightly the last two days and will start
skating Sunday or Monday. Stevens might play Tuesday night when the
Devils return home to play the Buffalo Sabres.
</P>
<P>
   In Robbie Ftorek's first season as coach, the Devils seem to be
exactly where they want to be at this stage of the season. They
seem very well tuned for the playoffs, which may encourage Lou
Lamoriello, the general manager, to avoid making any trades before
the trade deadline Tuesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   One player the Devils were considering trading for was
Edmonton's Boris Mironov, a talented defenseman with offensive
attributes, whom the Oilers sent to Chicago Saturday. &QL;

TAKING JOKES BY DUCHAMP TO ANOTHER LEVEL OF ART 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds., this is a later version of a story that moved on Friday,
March 19. It contains some additional material by the author. In
8th graf, spelling Rrose is CQ.))  
 (HLW)  
 By SARAH BOXER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In 1913, a decade before Marcel Duchamp gave up art for chess,
he took a bicycle wheel into his studio and mounted it on a stool.
He liked to watch it spin. The next year he took home a bottle
rack. In a letter to his sister, Suzanne, he said it was a
sculpture ``already made.'' For the next few years he collected
common, mass-produced objects, treated them as art and called them
readymades: a snow shovel (which he named ``In Advance of the
Broken Arm''), a urinal (``Fountain''), a hat rack, a comb and a
dozen or so more.
</P>
<P>
   The influence of Duchamp's readymades on 20th-century art is
incalculable. Without Duchamp, would Jasper Johns have painted
flags and targets? Would Andy Warhol have made his Brillo boxes?
Would there be any Conceptual Art at all?
</P>
<P>
   Well, take a deep breath and imagine art without the readymade.
Last month, Art News reported that Rhonda Roland Shearer, an
artist, had been trying for two years to prove that Duchamp's
readymades are not really mass-produced objects. She thinks he
altered or made them all, then cunningly covered up the evidence to
create a time-release surprise.
</P>
<P>
   To Ms. Shearer, this is like discovering that ``there was no
historical Jesus.'' She explains: ``You can't just say he was a
jokester and move on. What happens to the artists who took the
readymade as a sacred truth? It has meant too much to the people
who believe it.''
</P>
<P>
   This has caused a small stir among Duchamp scholars. First is
the factual question: Could she be right? Second, and perhaps more
to the point: Would it matter?
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Shearer has spared nothing to prove her case. She has a
number of research assistants and a bank of computers working for
her. She has bought hat racks, coat racks, advertising signs,
bicycle wheels, postcards of the Mona Lisa, snow shovels, perfume
bottles and urinals as well as old catalogues advertising the
above. Linda Dalrymple Henderson, the author of ``Duchamp in
Context,'' calls her work ``all the scholarship money can buy.''
</P>
<P>
   But there are complications even money and drive can't overcome.
</P>
<P>
   Duchamp himself admitted altering some of his readymades,
including ``Apolinere Enameled,'' a sign for Sapolin enamel paint
whose letters Duchamp changed to honor the poet Apollinaire, and
``Why Not Sneeze Rrose Selavy?'' a bird cage filled with marble
cubes, a thermometer and cuttlebone. Duchamp called these assisted
or rectified readymades.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Shearer is not fazed by Duchamp's admissions. She insists
his alterations always exceeded what he claimed. Duchamp, for
example, says he penciled a mustache and beard onto a cheap
reproduction of the Mona Lisa to create ``L.H.O.O.Q.'' (now on view
in the Museum of Modern Art's show ''The Museum as Muse''); Ms.
Shearer says he also painted in his own face.
</P>
<P>
   The assisted readymades aren't the only troublesome cases. Many
of Duchamp's readymades -- the bottle rack, bicycle wheel, snow
shovel, urinal, coat rack and hat rack -- vanished during his life.
They have been preserved only in photos of his studio, in replicas
that he sanctioned and in miniature models and photographs he
packed in his Boite-en-Valise, his museum in a suitcase (also
displayed in ``The Museum as Muse''). So, in many cases, Ms.
Shearer is working with circumstantial evidence. She doesn't mind.
She says the absence of the original readymades supports the idea
that they never existed as advertised.
</P>
<P>
   This is Ms. Shearer's case against the readymades so far.
</P>
<P>
   Duchamp's readymade glass ampoule, which he named ``50 cc of
Paris Air,'' is larger than any that would have been readily
available to pharmacists. (And she has a tape of a man from Corning
Glass saying so.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Beautiful Breath,'' the readymade perfume bottle with Man
Ray's photograph of Duchamp on it (now owned by Yves Saint Laurent)
is green, she says; the real bottles of ``Un Air Embaume,'' from
Rigaud, are peach-colored (like the empty but still-fragrant one
that Ms. Shearer bought for $650).
</P>
<P>
   The readymade snow shovel, which now exists only in photographs
and replicas, ``would hurt your hand'' if you tried to use it, Ms.
Shearer says, because it has a square shaft. And it doesn't have
the normal reinforcements to keep it from breaking. (She has hired
people to make her a snow shovel like Duchamp's and use it until it
breaks.)
</P>
<P>
   There is more: the bird cage is too squat for a real bird, the
iron hooks in the photograph of the coat rack appear to bend in an
impossible position, the French window opens the wrong way, the
bottle rack has an asymmetrical arrangement of hooks and the urinal
is too curvaceous to have come from the Mott Iron Works, where
Duchamp said he bought it.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not just one case,'' Ms. Shearer says. ``It's one thing
after another. You start feeling like a fool for taking him at his
word,'' she says. ``Does this make him more interesting?
Absolutely. He has been dead since 1968, but it's as if he's alive
now, because we have a whole new set of objects.''
</P>
<P>
   As Ms. Shearer explains in a two-part article in the journal Art
and Academe, it is time to stop thinking of readymades as objects
Duchamp brings home from the store and start seeing them as objects
dragged ``from the unconscious mind.'' She says that Duchamp was
influenced by the mathematician Henri Poincare's concept of the
invisible fourth dimension, and she says the readymades were
created to evoke it. She calls Duchamp's readymades ``three-
dimensional shadows'' of his ``fourth-dimensional creativity
machine.'' (Don't ask.)
</P>
<P>
   If Ms. Shearer has proved nothing else, she has proved an
irritant to Duchamp scholars. Although some are impressed by her
tireless research and her extensive collection of Duchampiana, they
grumble that she is using her money (including some from Paul
Mellon) and influential connections (including her husband, Stephen
Jay Gould, a Harvard zoology professor) to get attention. (She has
arranged a symposium at Harvard University on Duchamp and Poincare,
starring herself.) They scorn her ``scientific method.'' And they
are astounded that a ``hobbyist'' can get so far. Molly Nesbit, an
art historian at Vassar College, says Ms. Shearer has introduced
the kind of ``overinterpretation'' fans tend to make.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Shearer, facing down her critics, vows to ``smile and keep
tap-dancing.'' But why all the fuss and bother anyway? At this
point in history, does it matter if all the readymades were
Duchamp-made?
</P>
<P>
   David Joselit, the author of ``Infinite Regress: Marcel Duchamp
1910-1941,'' says no. It doesn't matter now whether Duchamp's
readymades were mass-produced commodities or objects made to look
like commodities. The point is, ``everything is a commodity,'' and
there are some commodities we choose to call art. All of Duchamp's
readymades are assisted in some sense, he says. ``They were
transformed the minute he inscribed them.''
</P>
<P>
   Other critics are not so blase. Ms. Henderson says it does
matter whether there was a genuine readymade, at least to start
with. ``The key issue is the first readymade, the bottle rack'' of
1914. And ``at that point Duchamp had no audience to fool by
manufacturing a fake object,'' she says. He had no motive for
deception.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to have the concept of the readymade before you
challenge it,'' says Francis Naumann, the author of a forthcoming
book, ``Marcel Duchamp: The Art of Making Art in the Age of
Mechanical Reproduction.'' After that, it matters less and less.
Once Duchamp established the idea of a readymade, he was constantly
monkeying around with it. He offered a ``shaved'' version of the
bearded Mona Lisa, and even created a ``reciprocal'' readymade:
``Use a Rembrandt as an ironing board.''
</P>
<P>
   In any case, even if Duchamp intended to deceive, the readymade
``has already affected a half century of artists,'' Naumann says.
``You can't take that away.''
</P>
<P>
   The readymade proved that ``a work of art only is a work of art
if you accept it,'' Naumann says.
</P>
<P>
   The readymade proved that ``art is a set of relationships, not a
thing,'' Joselit says.
</P>
<P>
   The readymade proved that ``everything and anything can be
art,'' says Thierry de Duve, the author of ``Kant after Duchamp.''
</P>
<P>
   So maybe the readymade is safe and sound. But what about
Duchamp? ``My opinion of Duchamp would change if she's right,''
Naumann admits. ``It would be a grand act of deception.''
</P>
<P>
   Arthur Danto, the art critic for The Nation, is more blunt. ``I
guess it's possible that he made a commercial porcelain urinal and
a grooming comb. But what would I think of him if his great
contribution was as a ceramicist or a woodworker? I think it would
make him far less important.'' Of course, ``that wouldn't change
the readymade; that's part of the discourse now.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But if she's right,'' he adds, ``I have no interest in
Duchamp.''

'61 NASA REJECTION NEVER DAMPENED AVIATOR'S SPIRIT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By MAUREEN WEST  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PRESCOTT, Ariz. _ Two groups of young aviators prepared
themselves for space in the early 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Mercury 7,'' who were chosen to fly, became famous and
financially secure. Among them is John Glenn, the first American in
orbit. As a group they celebrate 40 years together April 2.
</P>
<P>
   The second group, the ``Mercury 13,'' were women pilots whose
little-publicized astronaut training was scrubbed and who now live
in relative obscurity.
</P>
<P>
   Among those in the second group, trying hard to make ends meet,
is Irene Leverton, 72, a fixture at Prescott Airport. She earns a
small income as a flight instructor and sells the occasional
portrait of a famous aviator in the airport's small cafe, but she
lives mostly on her Social Security check.
</P>
<P>
   Although she struggles financially, money is not the driving
force in her life. Since childhood, her occupation and
preoccupation, the thing that has made it impossible for her to
stay in one place or to have a family life, is her need to fly. She
has always needed to fly.
</P>
<P>
   She gets a mystical look in her eyes when she describes flying
under the Northern Lights.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first time you see the Aurora Borealis, when the cockpit
is dark, then you know why you are flying,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   As one of the Mercury 13, she passed 75 endurance tests,
including sleep deprivation. One painful trial included the
injection of ice water into her ears.
</P>
<P>
   But after all the tests, NASA denied the women the opportunity
to train for space, and the thought of having female astronauts was
shelved for two decades.
</P>
<P>
   Leverton isn't angry about it; she's grateful for the
opportunity to show how good she was _ as good as the men.
</P>
<P>
   And she's glad that women finally made it into space. Lt. Col.
Eileen Collins will be the first female commander of a shuttle
flight this summer _ and Leverton and the other Mercury 13 hope to
be there cheering her on. Last week, NASA announced that an
all-female science mission likely will be flown soon.
</P>
<P>
   Although Leverton is applauding all those advances, she
struggles for her own flight time. The contract flights get harder
to come by as she gets ``more experienced.'' She doesn't say
``older.''
</P>
<P>
   A pilot can be on contract with a company and still not get
enough work to pay the mortgage.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one ever comes out and says, `You're fired,' '' Leverton
said. `I've observed that men pilots can go 10 to 15 years longer
than women before this happens.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like I've got some good years left, and I plan to use
them.''
</P>
<P>
   She doesn't want to retire, nor can she afford to. Her
spot-flying contracts have never generated a company pension to
supplement her Social Security, and any extra money has always gone
into the thin air of her passion _ perhaps for fuel or a plane
rental.
</P>
<P>
   To keep aloft, she paints pictures of such flyers as Amelia
Earhart and Charles Lindbergh and sells them at Susie's Skyway
Restaurant at Prescott Airport. They don't sell well, but the extra
cash now and then is helpful. She has also been commissioned to do
a painting of famous woman pilots from 1911 up to today, including
Sally Ride, who became the first American woman in space in 1983.
</P>
<P>
   Although flying hasn't made Leverton wealthy, it has made her
interesting. She's full of good memories, some of which are
captured in photos on the wall at Susie's. The romance of flying
leaps from the fading snapshots, one of which shows a young and
dashing Leverton, standing by one of the hundreds of planes that
have been more like home to her than any house.
</P>
<P>
   When she was a girl in Chicago, she always was threatening to
jump off the roof to fly free for a moment. Other parents were
afraid to let their kids play with Irene; she was a daredevil, not
a proper playmate.
</P>
<P>
   But her mother understood, probably because the spirit of
adventure runs deep in the DNA of some families. Her mother, who
worked as a scrubwoman, saved pennies to buy Irene a book about
flying.
</P>
<P>
   In high school, Leverton joined the Civil Air Patrol and finally
got a ride into the wild blue yonder. Soon, she was flying on her
own.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; In her 20s, she was a crop duster and a national speed champ
for pylon acing. Later, she was a trans-Atlantic racer.
</P>
<P>
   She was one of the most experienced women pilots in America
when, in 1961, she got the invitation to be among 25 women tested
for the rigors of space flight.
</P>
<P>
   A NASA flight would have been a thrill, but it probably wouldn't
have satisfied her need to fly.
</P>
<P>
   Flying has been her life, she says. Marriage would have
interferred, so it was ruled out. Most of the good women pilots she
once knew quit flying after marriage, so she veered away from that
altogether. When she was 45, she had a special feeling for a German
scientist she had met, but in the end, she flew away.
</P>
<P>
   She does have her friends, including Stewart Albright of
Phoenix, a flight instructor with her in the 1980s, and his wife.
They talk a couple of times a month about aviation.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ``She's one-of-a-kind,'' Albright said. ``She has achieved so
much, and she's still going at it. Very few women _ or men _ have
had the flying experience she's had.''
</P>
<P>
   Leverton has logged more than 25,000 hours flying anything with
a propeller.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona became her home in 1979 when she ran out of gas in her
car while driving through Phoenix and took a job to get resupplied.
She stayed.
</P>
<P>
   She moved to the Prescott area in 1988. Before that, the longest
she had lived in one place as an adult was two years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got to the point where I couldn't unpack,'' she said. ``The
minute I didn't get a raise or didn't get promoted, I'd leave.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Maybe she should have been pushier, Leverton concedes. But she
lost some jobs, she believes, because she was too quick to say what
she thought rather than playing along with office politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never learned what the game was,'' she said. ``I still
don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   Her mobile home in Chino Valley, north of Prescott Airport, is
home to her and her cats, P.D. and Kit Kit, and serves as a museum
of aviation. Plaques and trophies from the '50s, '60s and '70s form
the permanent collection. She has a bookcase full of books about
pioneer women fliers.
</P>
<P>
   She may have to add a video section. The History Channel last
year did a documentary on women in aviation history and included
interviews with Leverton and some of the other Mercury 13. Four of
the 13 still fly, she says, and their experience has bonded them
over the years.
</P>
<P>
   The family pictures on her wall are photos of airplanes she has
flown, and she has stories for each. Her scrapbooks reveal a woman
ahead of her time: In the 1950s and '60s, when other women flyers
sported big hair and frilly outfits for ``powder puff'' air events,
she wore pants, Amelia style.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University in Prescott,
hearing that Leverton had never been rated to fly jets because she
couldn't afford the training time, recently invited her to fly in
their 727 simulator. She was delighted, though not exactly pleased
when invited to sit in the co-pilot's seat.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not the same as being in the pilot's seat,'' she commented
later.
</P>
<P>
   But they invited her back for additional training time. She will
go, of course. After all, it's a chance to fly.
</P>
<P>
   In Chino Valley, some of the mobile homes have old cowboys
living in them, who have lived their lives for their horses and the
freedom of the wide open spaces. It is an instinct strangely
American, and not always reserved for men.
</P>
<P>
   Irene Leverton is one of those people who needs to be moving
fast and flying far above to be happy, regardless of any earthly
consequence.
</P>
<P>
   It's deep in the DNA, she agrees. &QL; Maureen West can be reached at

LABOR PRESSURE PAID OFF FOR AMWEST FLIGHT ATTENDANTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER CORBETT  
 and DAWN GILBERTSON  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A single figure - $80 million - was the only
salient detail to come out Saturday about the landmark contract
between America West Airlines and its flight attendants.
</P>
<P>
   But it said a lot, appearing to show that the flight attendants'
perseverence - and high-profile strike threats - had paid off.
</P>
<P>
   Deanna Clarkson, spokeswoman for the America West council of the
Association of Flight Attendants, said the five-year contract for
the 2,400 attendants is valued at more than $80 million. That's a
compromise between America West's $68.7 million offer and the $85.3
million sought by the union, but is clearly closer to the flight
attendants' goal than America West's.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't get all that we wanted, but we got close,'' William
McGlashen, local president of the AFA, said of the deal struck in
the wee hours of Saturday morning.
</P>
<P>
   America West isn't commenting on the details until flight
attendants are briefed, but the airline no doubt got concessions in
exchange for bumping up the contract total. Chairman Bill Franke is
a tough negotiator and always has one eye on the bottom line.
</P>
<P>
   ``The contract, while difficult to negotiate, addresses the
principal concerns of both parties,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   One area where America West apparently prevailed is in travel
expenses, or per diem. The union demanded $1.80 per hour, matching
what pilots receive. America West has been paying the equivalent of
89 cents per hour in per diem and would only agree to increase it
to $1.30 per hour for the first 30 months, $1.50 for 30 months and
$1.75 at the end of the contract.
</P>
<P>
   In announcing the deal about 3 a.m. Saturday in Washington
outside the National Mediation Board offices, McGlashen said the
company's offer to raise salaries to 90 percent of what Southwest
Airlines pays its flight attendants was the basis for the
settlement.
</P>
<P>
   The Southwest pay scale ranges from starting pay of $15,500 a
year to $44,000, according to the AFA. America West's scale ranges
from $12,000 to $22,000 per year.
</P>
<P>
   The tentative agreement, more details of which are expected
today, rewards flight attendants for their sacrifices made to help
America West survive bankruptcy and reorganization in the early
1990s, McGlashen said. It especially boosts salaries for long-time
flight attendants, some of whom haven't had a pay increase in four
years.
</P>
<P>
   About 1,600, or 75 percent, of the carrier's flight attendants
have been with the company for between 10 and 16 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an improvement over our last tentative agreement,''
McGlashen said of a 1997 tentative deal of $53.5 million that was
soundly rejected by flight attendants.
</P>
<P>
   AFA union members must still ratify the contract. A mail-in vote
is expected to be completed in about a month, McGlashen said.
</P>
<P>
   In a recorded message to members shortly after the settlement
was reached, the AFA said ``the upcoming days are very cruical for
our workforce.''
</P>
<P>
   It said union members will be preparing a summary of the
contract agreement to present to flight attendants. Within the next
several weeks, flight attendants will receive a copy of the
settlement at home. That will be followed by a series of road shows
by union officials after which members will vote on ratification.
No dates have been set. The process took about six weeks after the
airline's last tentative agreement in late 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The stock market is likely to cheer the settlement news on
Monday, though some investors might have seen a deal coming - the
airline's stock rallied last week as the strike deadline
approached. America West's stock closed Friday at $17.63.
</P>
<P>
   If the stock gets a bump, it might be from investors betting on
renewed interest in America West from United Airlines or other
suitors. America West announced last month that it was ending
much-hyped merger talks with United and other airlines because
there were too many conditions attached and a buyout might not be
blessed by federal regulators.
</P>
<P>
   Julius Maldutis, airline analyst with CIBC Oppenheimer in New
York, is in the camp that expects more bids.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once a labor contract with the flight attendants is signed, we
fully expect UAL Corp. to make a counter offer for America West,''
he wrote in a March 9 report.
</P>
<P>
   Holly Hegeman, who chronicles the airline industry at
www.planebusiness.com and originally broke the story of United's
interest in America West, also expects an offer now that the flight
attendant troubles are behind America West.
</P>
<P>
   ``We expect to see another offer from United Airlines for the
folks in Phoenix, as well as a possible AWA/TWA deal that may come
together as well,'' she wrote after the settlement was announced.
</P>
<P>
   Franke has said America West plans to remain independent. The
flight attendants contract, he said, ``assures that we can continue
the airline's strategic growth without interruption and our
employees can focus on providing quality customer service.''
</P>
<P>
   A big question that remains is the financial impact of the
threatened strike. Many travel agents said they had been booking
away from America West - some for months - so passengers didn't
risk getting stranded.
</P>
<P>
   America West's first quarter financial results won't be out
until mid-April. But if the impact is serious and cuts deeply into
profits, the company likely will issue a warning to Wall Street
before then so there are no surprises. AMR Corp., the parent of
American Airlines, did that last week. The Dallas company said a
sick-out by its pilots last month will shave $200 to $255 million
off earnings before taxes.
</P>
<P>
   ``In addition to the losses associated with the canceled
flights, customers were reluctant to book American for a period of
time after the job action,'' the company said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   America West is much smaller than American - No. 9 in the
industry versus No. 2 - and its labor problems didn't result in
canceled flights. Still, the losses likely mounted.
</P>
<P>
   One analyst told Bloomberg News that America West lost millions
of dollars in advance bookings. &QL;

PURDUE BEATS NORTH CAROLINA, 80-59  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By ZACK BURGESS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NORMAL, Ill. _ For more than a month, Purdue has been expected
to deliver victory after victory. Their much heralded guard
combination of Ukari Figgs and Stephanie White-McCarty is
considered by many to be the best in the nation. And when it comes
to balance off the bench, they are as good as any team playing in
the National Collegiate Athletic Association tournament.
</P>
<P>
   So when Purdue took the floor against North Carolina at the
Midwest Regional Saturday night, the idea of the Boilermakers being
upset became an afterthought well before the contest even started.
Purdue overwhelmed North Carolina, 80-59, to move into the final
eight Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   Even though Purdue was expected to win the game, the
Boilermakers couldn't take anything for granted. After all, North
Carolina is a former NCAA champion. And all week they had to hear
about North Carolina's athletic combination of Nikki Teasley, Juana
Brown and LaQuanda Barksdale.
</P>
<P>
   But the Boilermakers overpowered the Tar Heels with a smothering
defense and impressive offense. Purdue outrebounded, outshot and
out-hustled the Tar Heels, embarrassing them throughout the first
half, shooting 55 percent from the field in the first half. That
included 44 percent from behind the 3-point arc, while the Tar
Heels shot 33 percent from the field before the half. North
Carolina also had nine turnovers to go with its poor shooting.
</P>
<P>
   Figgs scored a game-high 24 points while registering six
assists, and White-McCarty scored 18 points while handing out seven
assists.
</P>
<P>
   Figgs began the game with a 3-pointer from the right side and
two plays later White-McCarty hit a 3-pointer of her own. And even
though at this point it wasn't clear that the Tar Heels were about
to blown out, it became apparent a few plays later.
</P>
<P>
   With 15 minutes 59 seconds to go in the first half, North
Carolina called a timeout. It didn't help, however, as Figgs and
Michelle Duhart came out of the timeout and put on a short display
of excellent basketball to keep the Tar Heels guessing.
</P>
<P>
   There was the layup by Duhart right out of the timeout. And the
dazzling pass from Figgs back to Duhart. From there, North
Carolina's Jauna Brown struggled to make a simple layup underneath.
It was just one example of the Tar Heels' struggles.
</P>
<P>
   And while the Tar Heels tried to fight back with a 15-footer by
Jackie Higgins to cut the score to 17-10, Purdue was just too much.
By the end of the first half the Boilermakers had built a 38-22
lead. From there it was out of reach.
</P>
<P>
   Purdue Coach Carolyn Peck, who is in her second year, has guided
the Boilermakers to consecutive appearances in the final eight.

METROSTARS BEAT FUSION, 3-2  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By CHARLIE NOBLES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. _ It wasn't Jets-Dolphins or Knicks-Heat.
But the MetroStars and Fusion Saturday night added a soccer rivalry
to the New York vs. Miami sports scene.
</P>
<P>
   In the Major League Soccer season opener for both teams, the
MetroStars won a dramatic shootout, 3-2, at Lockhart Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   The intensity of the game was playoff caliber, particularly as
it tightened in the second half.
</P>
<P>
   ``Must be a Miami-New York thing,'' Fusion defender Wade Webber
said after the MetroStars' first victory in four season openers.
</P>
<P>
   They won the shootout, 2-1. Midfielder Tab Ramos started things
by scoring in the right corner. After the Fusion's Leo Cullen tied
it, Miles Joseph _ the third player up for the MetroStars _ scored
what proved to be the winner by slipping the ball just inside the
left post.
</P>
<P>
   The tension built as the final three players to shoot for Miami
_ Carlos Valderrama, Jay Heaps and Diego Serna _ all failed to
score. MetroStars goalie Mike Ammann deflected Serna's effort wide
right to seal the victory.
</P>
<P>
   Before Serna's miss, Brian Kelly had a chance to clinch the
victory for the MetroStars, but his shot hit the crossbar.
</P>
<P>
   In Bora Milutinovic's regular-season debut as MetroStars coach,
he was missing just two players who may have an impact with the
team _ midfielder Roy Myers, who is not available until April 3
because of a commitment to play in the Costa Rican Nations Cup, and
a fourth foreign player who likely won't be chosen for the first
two games.
</P>
<P>
   The visitors had practiced outdoors only once since March 12 _
on Friday _ coming into this game, but it didn't show.
</P>
<P>
   The MetroStars played the tight defense that is the trademark of
Milutinovic's teams, then momentarily silenced the crowd of 13,648
with a goal in the 36th minute.
</P>
<P>
   Ramos pushed the ball up the right side, then threaded a pass to
forward Eduardo Hurtado over the middle. Hurtado paused,
flat-footed, then found the right corner, barely eluding the
outstretched arm of goalie Dusty Hudock.
</P>
<P>
   The Fusion hovered near the MetroStars' goal for much of the
remainder of the half, but headers by Valderrama and Serna missed
their target.
</P>
<P>
   The MetroStars received a scare near the end of the half when
Ramos was kicked in the right shin by Miami's Henry Gutierrez as
they slid into each other. Ramos lay on the field for more than a
minute before limping through the rest of the half.
</P>
<P>
   Ramos bruised his shin, but it didn't keep him from helping the
MetroStars take a 2-0 lead. He penetrated the Miami defense, then
passed to forward Mark Chung. Chung left-footed it to Hurtado on
the right side.
</P>
<P>
   The ball never landed as Hurtado timed it for a right-footed
kick that bounced off Hudock and came to rest in the net's right
corner.
</P>
<P>
   About 30 seconds later, in the 53rd minute, the Fusion got back
into it. Valderrama slipped a pass inside to forward Roberto
Gaucho, who popped it by Ammann, the new MetroStars goalie.
</P>
<P>
   The Fusion thought it scored the game-tying goal soon after, but
a Fusion player was ruled offside when Serna put the ball in the
net.
</P>
<P>
   Ammann made a distinctive, diving stop of Gaucho's shot in the
65th minute, but the Fusion kept the pressure on. A minute later,
defender Jay Heaps scored his first MLS goal on a header to tie the
game at 2-2.
</P>
<P>
   The MetroStars suffered a blow in the 87th minute when the
feisty defender Arley Palacios was thrown out for tackling defender
Mario Gori from behind.

   (NOTE: Because of the complicated figuring involved, you are
requested to use these Best Sellers lists in full or not at all.
This particularly applies to the Paperbacks. The ``Advice, How-To,
and Miscellaneous'' listings were separated from the nonfiction
list for important reasons, and not to print ``Advice, How-To and
Miscellaneous'' gives an impression that is incorrect, resulting in
criticism from publishing houses.)

OHIO STATE CONTINUES TURNAROUND

 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MIKE JONES 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   KNOXVILLE, Tenn. _ The Bucks don't stop here.
</P>
<P>
   Ohio State's historic turnaround continued on to St. Petersburg,
Fla., last night as the Buckeyes survived a few late, anxious
moments to hold off St. John's in the South Regional championship
game, 77-74.
</P>
<P>
   The Scarlet and Gray will be making its first appearance in the
Final Four since 1968 _ a year that marked the end of a seven-year
span in which Ohio State appeared three times and the names of
Havlicek, Lucas and Bill Hoskett were synonymous with the best in
college basketball.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really, really hard to put into words the feeling that is
shared by all of us right now,'' said coach Jim O'Brien, whose team
was 8-22 a year ago. ``It's hard to imagine we've put ourselves in
this position.''
</P>
<P>
   The Buckeyes led from the opening tip, at times by as much as 13
points. But St. John's refused to fade and the last minute was a
frantic one, as it usually is in games of this magnitude.
</P>
<P>
   So typically, the final sequence was a blur in the minds of
those closest to it.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Storm trailed, 76-74, when guard Erick Barkley took an
inbounds pass after Ohio State's Scoonie Penn made only one of two
free throws with 12.2 seconds left.
</P>
<P>
   Barkley crossed midcourt and came off a pick at the top of the
key. But suddenly, the ball continued toward the basket without
him. And in a flash, the Buckeyes' Michael Redd had the ball and,
in effect, the game in hand.
</P>
<P>
   Fouled with only seven-tenths of a second left, Redd made one of
two free throws and Barkley's desperation full-court fling of the
rebound was way off left.
</P>
<P>
   ``I lost the ball, it was my fault,'' an overwhelmingly dejected
Barkley said later in the dressing room. ``It just came loose.''
</P>
<P>
   Television replays suggested Penn might have nudged him with a
forearm in the back.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the way the game was played,'' Barkley said. ``They
didn't call it at the start and they're not going to call it at the
end.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not even sure what happened,'' said Penn, who scored a
team-high 22 points and was named the region's most outstanding
player. ``I think I got a hand on the ball, then I saw it bounding
out freely.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he nudged Barkley, Penn replied, ``I don't know. Maybe
I did or maybe I didn't. I know I didn't do enough to make him lose
the ball. I didn't push him or anything like that. But it happened
so quickly, I really don't know what happened.''
</P>
<P>
   St. John's coach Mike Jarvis praised the Buckeyes and refused to
join the debate about the late sequence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ohio State played great from start to the end,'' Jarvis said.
``Unfortunately, we didn't match their intensity the whole game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Great players make great plays. A great player took it away
from another great player. Even if I saw \RPenn's\S hand on Erick's
back, what good would it do?
</P>
<P>
   ``There were a lot of hands on a lot of people's backs all
night. You have to try and make a play whether there's a hand on
your back or not. And if I saw it, I wouldn't mention it. Ohio
State deserved to win and if we'd made last basket, we'd have
deserved to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Lavor Postell led the Red Storm with 24. Bootsy Thornton scored
18. Barkley had 13 points and seven assists.
</P>
<P>
   Penn and Redd combined for 42 points, but Ohio State also got a
boost from its front line. Center Ken Johnson had 12 points and
seven blocked shots and forward Jason Singleton scored 13.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a terrific win for us,'' O'Brien said. ``It's as good
as it gets _ for the time being.''

UCONN REACHES FIRST FINAL FOUR
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ His burden removed and his team headed to the Final
Four, Connecticut coach Jim Calhoun lost control. He cried. He
cried for his players, he cried for his school, and he cried for
himself.
</P>
<P>
   After several trips to the brink, after crushing losses in the
Sweet 16 and Elite Eight, after missed free throws and last-second
knives and all those No.1 seeds he could not overcome, Calhoun is
headed to St. Pete.
</P>
<P>
   It sure is sweet.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the last 10 years, we've had teams that made a run at the
Final Four,'' he said. ``Every one of those kids, I loved. They
never gave me an ounce of disappointment, but other teams got in
the way of moving on.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is for them and for this team, which wouldn't allow
anything to get in the way of St. Petersburg.''
</P>
<P>
   So it was that No. 1 seed Connecticut advanced to the first
Final Four in school history with a riveting 67-62 victory Saturday
over No. 10 Gonzaga, before 18,053 at America West Arena. The
margin was closer than most expected, but for the Huskies, who play
South Regional champ Ohio State in the national semifinals,
survival was all that mattered.
</P>
<P>
   It hasn't been easy carrying the hopes of a state _ and the
burdens of previous NCAA failures.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ever since Aug. 9, there have been questions about us getting
to the Final Four,'' Connecticut point guard Khalid El-Amin said.
``We've been trying to play that down all year and just go out and
play basketball. We just have the hearts of champions. I can't tell
you how good this feels.''
</P>
<P>
   What was the difference? What separates these Huskies from
previous versions? They struggled with Gonzaga just as they
struggled with lower seeds Florida (1994) and Mississippi State
(1996). When Gonzaga dashed to a 41-37 lead early in the second
half, the memories of collapses past returned and Connecticut's
cheering section turned silent.
</P>
<P>
   Well, the difference was one man: All-American guard Richard
Hamilton, who thrived where former UConn stars Donyell Marshall and
Ray Allen had faltered.
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton scored a game-high 21 points and singlehandedly forced
Gonzaga into a zone defense. During the Bulldogs' boldest charge,
early in the second half, Hamilton responded with eight consecutive
points. He gave Connecticut a 55-53 lead with six minutes left, and
he found center Jake Voskuhl for the biggest basket _ a layup with
1:02 remaining that gave the Huskies a 63-59 advantage.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Hamilton played ferocious defense and held Gonzaga
sharpshooter Richie Frahm to seven points on 2 of 11 field goals.
Add his four rebounds _ UConn had a 47-33 advantage on the boards _
and Hamilton was the one equation Gonzaga could not solve during
its breathtaking postseason charge.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's as good a player as we've gone against all year,''
Gonzaga coach Dan Monson said. ``He was the reason we basically
couldn't guard them man-to-man.''
</P>
<P>
   Trailing 65-62 with 34 seconds remaining, the Bulldogs
uncharacteristically botched their last chances. First, Frahm
missed a leaning 15-footer, then guard Matt Santangelo heaved a
wild runner from the right side.
</P>
<P>
   ``I probably should have kicked it out,'' Santangelo said. ``I
may have made a bad decision.''

OHIO STATE BEATS ST. JOHN'S, 77-74  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By JUDY BATTISTA   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   KNOXVILLE, Tenn. _ St. John's Coach Mike Jarvis looked back at
the end to see what he was missing. Erick Barkley already knew. The
St. John's point guard pulled his white jersey up over his eyes and
weaved blindly through the celebrating Ohio State players tumbling
around him, never raising his head, inconsolable over the result.
</P>
<P>
   St. John's lost to Ohio State Saturday night, 77-74, letting a
chance to pull off a miracle victory in the final seconds of the
South Regional final and a trip to the Final Four slip away. The
magnificent run through the National Collegiate Athletic
Association tournament ended with uncharacteristically
absent-minded play until the final moments and the agony of a
missed opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were supposed to go to the Final Four,'' forward Ron Artest
said. ``We were supposed to be there. The other teams we played
were good, but we were better. Tonight, as a team, we weren't
better.''
</P>
<P>
   The Red Storm had clawed from behind all night, never
rediscovering the intelligent, faultless play that had gotten it
this far. St. John's was dominated by Ohio State's guards _ Scoonie
Penn, who had 22 points and 8 assists, and Michael Redd, who had 20
points and 5 assists. It was intimidated by the shot blocking of
Buckeyes center Ken Johnson. And the St. John's players _
particularly Artest, who was completely off his game _ failed to
produce the sort of efforts on which they had come to rely. They
shot just 39.4 percent from the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``We weren't executing,'' said Artest, who had just 9 points to
go with 5 turnovers and several miserable 3-point attempts. ``We
could have easily won this game.''
</P>
<P>
   But in the closing minutes, Ohio State's shaky free-throw
shooting _ Coach Jim O'Brien had employed a sports psychologist
during the season to try to improve its 61.5 percent success rate _
gave St. John's a final chance to win. With the clock running under
12 seconds and St. John's trailing by just 2 points, it was the Red
Storm's ball and Barkley walked the ball up court, dribbling with
his left hand. As he crossed midcourt, he switched to his right
hand and began to drive diagonally to his right. Just below the
foul line, Penn put his right hand on Barkley's left hip. No foul
was called, but Barkley was turned slightly and he dribbled the
ball off his leg. It was picked up by Redd, who dribbled away in
delight as scarlet-clad fans cascaded from the stands.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no one between me and the basket,'' said Barkley,
who sobbed in the locker room afterward.
</P>
<P>
   While Barkley's rare error _ it was his only turnover of the
game _ came at the most critical moment, it was merely the last one
St. John's made. The third-seeded Red Storm was presumed to be the
quicker, more physical, more intelligent of the two teams left in
the South Regional. But the tenor of the game was set immediately,
when St. John's, for one of the few times all season, could not
find a way to compensate for its lack of height. The 6-foot-11-inch
Johnson blocked three shots in the first three minutes of the game.
He finished with seven blocks in all and, most important, kept the
Red Storm from consistently trying to penetrate.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't attack him,'' Jarvis said. ``He controlled the
game.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson had 12 points, part of fourth-seeded Ohio State's
unusually balanced offensive attack. Only two Buckeyes average in
double figures for scoring, Penn and Redd. Saturday night, four
players _ Johnson and Jason Singleton were the others _ scored in
double figures. St. John's, which had excelled with the zone
defense in victories over Indiana and Maryland, played a mixture of
zone and man-to-man defense, and neither seemed to work
particularly well.
</P>
<P>
   In sharp contrast in the scoring column was St. John's. All five
of its starters average in double figures, but only Barkley (13
points, 7 assists), Bootsy Thornton (18 points) and Lavor Postell
(24 points, a career high) performed to expectations. But the
entire team seemed lost, particularly in the first half, when the
Red Storm fell behind by as many as 11 points. The senior center
Tyrone Grant reinjured his right wrist early in the game and
finished with just 3 points. Distraught, he said he let his team
down.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I start out really well, the team somehow follows,'' Grant
said. ``It's very painful how it ended. I'll take all the blame for
the loss because luck hasn't been on my side. I did nothing but
hurt the team in the long run by trying to play through the pain.''
</P>
<P>
   Only Postell seemed energized on offense. After a terrible start
in which he took several awful shots, Postell found his shooting
touch. Every time St. John's looked finished, Postell hit a
critical shot.
</P>
<P>
   When the Red Storm fell behind by 10 points early in the second
half, Postell hit a 14-foot jumper. Down by 11 with 13 minutes 22
seconds to play, St. John's went to Postell again, for a layup.
When St. John's trailed by 13 with 9:08 remaining, Postell hit a
3-pointer, one of four. When it was down by 10 again, with 6:30
remaining, there was another Postell 3-pointer. It was those shots
that gave St. John's any hope as the closing minutes came.
</P>
<P>
   ``We weren't going out without a fight,'' Postell said. ``We
love to get up on teams and have them fight back. That's wasting
extra energy, and the whole game we were struggling to fight
back.''
</P>
<P>
   There was simply not enough fight left. St. John's had cruised
through unexpectedly easy victories over Indiana and Maryland to
get here, and, as the third-seeded team, was the clear favorite to
advance to its first Final Four since 1985. St. John's claimed it
was not surprised by how quick and physical the Buckeyes were, but
the Red Storm was stunned by its own ineptness against a team that
has enjoyed its own remarkable resurgence this season, rising from
the bottom of the Big Ten last season to the Final Four now.
</P>
<P>
   Before the game, Jarvis had called St. John's run an incredible
journey. Afterward, he was philosophical about what he wanted his
team to remember from this shockingly successful, and now
heartbreaking, season.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was not a loss,'' Jarvis said. ``This was just a
temporary setback. The journey will continue because we didn't
reach our destination. I don't think we were put here to go to the
Final Four.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we ever get there, that's great. But I don't think that's
why we're here. We were put here to learn lessons about teamwork.
And even how to lose.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a painful lesson.

   SOUTH: Y'ALL COME BACK NOW
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps it was just as well that the St. John's Red Storm and
Ohio State Buckeyes ended up in the South Region's championship
game.
</P>
<P>
   For alas, the highways of Tennessee might not have been safe
this weekend for Tigers and Terrapins.
</P>
<P>
   Only hours before the basketball teams from Auburn and Maryland
were eliminated from the NCAA Tournament on Thursday night, the
state's House of Representatives passed a bill legalizing the
consumption of road-killed wild animals.
</P>
<P>
   Sponsors of the so-called ``road-kill bill'' said the measure
was formulated in response to complaints from citizens without
proper hunting licenses who harvested deer hit by motor vehicles
and wound up being charged with illegal possession by the Tennessee
Wildlife Resources Agency.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, House Speaker Jimmy Naifeh said, it also becomes legal for
patrons to pick up a deceased raccoon that has been clocked by an
18-wheeler and donate it to his annual''Coon Supper'' without
having to pay state taxes.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Sen. Tim Burchett (R-Tenn), however, expressed concern that
the bill would only open the door for ``a bunch of Yankees coming
down here to make fun of us.''
</P>
<P>
   Not only a bunch of Yankees.  &LR; name:_Mike Jones
EAST: CHANEY ONE OF A KIND
</P>
<P>
   Casual sports fans likely know Temple's John Chaney for his
threatening to kill then-Massachusetts coach John Calipari a few
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   But Chaney, 67, is much more than a strutting sideline maniac.
Much more.
</P>
<P>
   He was born in Florida and went to high school in Philadelphia.
In 1951, he was the city's high school player of the year. But that
was back in the days of racial quotas and Chaney wound up playing
at Bethune-Cookman. A former teammate has said that Chaney was the
best player he had seen until some guy named Michael Jordan came
along.
</P>
<P>
   Chaney has adamantly campaigned against the NCAA eligibility
guidelines that a federal judge recently struck down because they
discriminated against minorities. Chaney believes in fairness, even
though he has seen his share of injustice. He was 50 before he got
his first Division I job, at Temple in 1982.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always enjoyed being around John,'' said Duke coach Mike
Krzyzewski, whose top-seeded team face Chaney's Owls in the East
Regional final today. ``And it's obvious that he's a good coach,
too. He's an honest guy and a sincere person. There aren't many of
those.''  &LR; name:_ Wendell Barnhouse
Midwest: All-World Wally
</P>
<P>
   When Miami's remarkable ride through the Midwest Regional
finally ended Friday night, coach Charlie Coles tossed an odd
question at the media.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, let me ask you guys something,'' he said. ``Was Wally
\RSzczerbiak\S on the cover of /Sports Illustrated'' this week?''
</P>
<P>
   Yeah, Charlie. It was on newsstands all over the country. Didn't
you ...
</P>
<P>
   ``Aw, I never have time to look for that stuff,'' Coles said.
``But when somebody told me, I thought, `Gee, I hope Kentucky
doesn't see that thing.'''
</P>
<P>
   Wildcats can read, too, Charlie.
</P>
<P>
   With or without magazine covers, everyone was keying on
Szczerbiak all the way. And although Miami was finally stopped by
Kentucky, the charismatic RedHawks forward _ who scored 90 points
in three games _ will remain one of the larger memories of the 1999
NCAA tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Every time he stepped on the court _ in New Orleans or St. Louis
_ crowds erupted in cheers. Kentucky players compared him to Duke's
Elton Brand and Auburn's Chris Porter. Others, noticing a certain
resemblance, called him Superman. A local columnist dismissed a
comparison with Cinderella, saying, ``Szczerbiak is
better-looking.''
</P>
<P>
   When it was over and the RedHawks were done, he said simply, ``I
will always remember Miami University, because people have been
wonderful to me, and I would not be the person I am now if I had
not gone to there. I have made lifelong friends, and I am grateful.
</P>
<P>
   ``We managed to do something no Miami team has ever done (reach
the Sweet 16), and we will walk away with our heads high.''
 &LR; name:_Whit Canning
West: Leave the walking to us
</P>
<P>
   Want to rent a car at Sky Harbor International Airport in
Phoenix? You'd have an easier time trying to get a ticket to the
Connecticut-Gonzaga game.
</P>
<P>
   Several high-profile events in this area, along with the usual
amount of Easterners who trek here for annual vacations, made
travel accommodations extra tough this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   San Diego resident Sharon Ross told the ``Arizona Republic''
that even though she is a preferred customer with Hertz, the
company ran out of cars for her. She said they offered her a
compact car for $159, but she would have to return it the next day.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's highway robbery,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Why are all the cars gone? There was the West Regional, The
Standard Register Ping LPGA Tournament and the Cox Communications
Air Show Spectacular. Also this week, an electrical engineers'
conference brought in 8,500 visitors, and the American Medical
Association hosted 900 doctors. Not to mention all the people who
flock here for Cactus League baseball in nearby Scottsdale and
Mesa.  &LR; name:_Kevin Lyons

<P>
   PHOENIX _ There was no Christian Laettner miracle this time, and
no national-champion-to-be UCLA standing in the way of a trip to
the Final Four. No, for Connecticut, and expectation-weary coach
Jim Calhoun, those demons were all exorcised yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the Huskies made all the plays, ending the magical ride
of the nation's sweethearts, Gonzaga, in a 67-62 victory in the
West Regional final at America West Arena.
</P>
<P>
   Tournament most valuable player Richard Hamilton scored 21
points and Connecticut held sharpshooting Gonzaga to 5-of-21 from
the 3-point line, and just two field goals of any kind in the final
7:19.
</P>
<P>
   The elements combined to send a coach with 552 career victories
to his first Final Four after three previous regional championship
game losses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over the last 10 years we've had a lot of great teams that
\Rcould have made\S the Final Four ... but fate, like a Christian
Laettner, or other teams, got in the way of moving on,'' said
Calhoun, in his 13th season at Connecticut and 27th season overall
as a head basketball coach. ``This win is for those teams, and for
this particular team, which wouldn't allow anything to get in the
way of us getting to St. Petersburg.'' The Huskies will play Ohio
State in the national semifinals next Saturday in the Florida.
</P>
<P>
   UConn lost a regional final to Duke in 1990 on Laettner's
game-winning shot.
</P>
<P>
   Yesterday, it was an emotional locker room for the Huskies.
</P>
<P>
   Calhoun dedicated the victory to former team trainer Joe McGinn,
26, who died Tuesday before the Huskies' first tournament game.
McGinn had been diagnosed with a kidney disease and died of a heart
attack.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a few tears in my eyes, a lot of us did,'' senior guard
Ricky Moore said. ``There were just so many emotions out there. I'm
totally exhausted.''
</P>
<P>
   Moore, a senior shooting guard, played 38 minutes. Most came in
the role of point guard, where he was playing because Khalid
El-Amin (0-of-12 shooting from the field) missed 15:30 of the first
half because of foul trouble. Moore scored 12 points, and held Matt
Santangelo, one of the Bulldogs' best shooters, to two points on
1-of-9 shooting, including 0-of-4 from beyond the arc.
</P>
<P>
   Moore's defensive wizardry rubbed off on his teammates, who held
Gonzaga to 35 percent shooting (20-of-57) from the floor. They made
every Gonzaga shot an adventure, Bulldogs coach Dan Monson said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The toughest thing was that even if you ran a play and a guy
was open, their quickness to recovery was tremendous,'' Monson
said. ``It seemed like every time our guys would have an open look,
there would be somebody flying at them with a hand up.''
</P>
<P>
   No one had an answer for the 6-foot-6 Hamilton, a first-team All
American. Gonzaga even tried guarding him with 5-8 point guard
Quentin Hall for much of the game. But Hamilton still wound up
shooting 9-of-16 from the floor.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the feisty Bulldogs, the first No. 10 seed to reach a
regional championship game in eight years, would not go away. In
fact, Gonzaga led by as much as four, and had it tied, at 55-55
with 5:59 to go. Keeping them in the game was Hall, who drove
through the extended Huskies defense to make spectacular,
off-balance layups that accounted for many of his 18 points.
</P>
<P>
   Hall's last basket, a leaning three-pointer with 36.9 seconds to
go, brought the Bulldogs to within 63-62. But the Huskies hit their
final four free throws to end Cinderella's stay in the Big Dance.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a wild ride,'' Santangelo said. ``You don't always
get to ride in the team plane and get a police escort. Stuff like
that doesn't happen to little ol' Gonzaga. None of us will ever
forget this.''  &LR; tagtop:Kevin Lyons (817) 390-7760

   &UR; ECHOES OF A NATIVE LAND: TWO CENTURIES OF A RUSSIAN VILLAGE &LR;  By
Serge Schmemann. Vintage, $15. A former Moscow bureau chief for The
New York Times visits his ancestral village, creating _ with the
help of the recollections of its long-suffering inhabitants _ a
miniature history of Russia in the 20th century. ```Echoes of a
Native Land' is that rare achievement: a Russian memoir that
subverts the conventions of the genre and tells us, in clear,
elegant and understated prose, that you can't go home again,''
Michael Ignatieff wrote in The New York Times Book Review in 1997.

   &UR; DOWN THERE ON A VISIT &LR;  By Christopher Isherwood. University of
Minnesota, $15.95. In four tales set in Berlin, Greece, London and
California, the author of ``Berlin Stories'' explores the sexuality
and inner turmoil of four vastly different protagonists, from a
male prostitute to a German worker taken with the bohemian life.
``This excellent novel ... may be the best Christopher Isherwood
has written,'' Gerald Sykes wrote in the Book Review in 1962. ``Out
of his literary detachment, strengthened by mystical studies, has
come a deeply intelligent and quietly compelling story.''
</P>
<P>
   The same publisher has reissued  &UR; THE MEMORIAL &LR;  ($15.95), which
tracks the falling apart of a British family after World War I.
Isherwood's ``concern is with a mood, a collective state of mind,
one which is perhaps more accurately named a state of nerves,''
Edith R. Mirrielees wrote in 1946.

<P>
   &UR; THE FOOTNOTE: A CURIOUS HISTORY &LR;  By Anthony Grafton. Harvard
University, $14. A history professor digs up some surprising lore
as he traces the development of the footnote from ancient Greece to
Gibbon (a master of the genre) to its modern practitioners. The
result is ``a witty and characteristically erudite book,'' David
McKitterick wrote in 1997. ``The pages of `The Footnote' are
peppered with human folly.''

<P>
   &UR; A GENTLE MADNESS: BIBLIOPHILES, BIBLIOMANES, AND THE ETERNAL
PASSION FOR BOOKS &LR;  By Nicholas A. Basbanes. Owl/Holt, $18.95. This
explores book collecting and those driven to pursue it, and
features a sweeping Who's Who of collectors, living and dead,
visionary and loony. ```A Gentle Madness' is an impressive
achievement in its compilation of vast information, as well as
instructive and interesting,'' Philip Kopper wrote in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ENDURING LOVE &LR;  By Ian McEwan. Anchor/Doubleday, $12.95. A
chance encounter radically changes the lives of a married science
writer and a young man who develops an erotic religious fixation on
him. In 1998 the reviewer Sven Birkerts called this ``a vibrant and
unsettling'' novel that ``reminds us that normal behavior conceals
but does not banish unsavory truths.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE RAPE OF NANKING: THE FORGOTTEN HOLOCAUST OF WORLD WAR II &LR; 
By Iris Chang. Penguin, $14.95. In 1937, Japanese troops
slaughtered hundreds of thousands of citizens in Nanking, an act of
barbarism rarely spoken of (for different reasons) in both Japan
and China. ``Iris Chang, whose own grandparents were survivors,
recounts the grisly massacre with understandable outrage,'' Orville
Schell wrote in 1997.

   &UR; BARNEY POLAN'S GAME: A NOVEL OF THE 1951 COLLEGE BASKETBALL
SCANDALS &LR;  By Charley Rosen. Harvest/Harcourt Brace, $13. In this
fictional account of basketball's equivalent of the 1919 Black Sox
scandal, an idealistic sports columnist bears witness to the
corruption of the sport by gamblers and players who conspired to
fix games. ``Rosen's novel is a particularly American form of
tragedy, in which the characters do not have to fall from great
heights to fall from grace,'' Allen Barra wrote in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE CITY GAME: FROM THE GARDEN TO THE PLAYGROUNDS &LR;  By Pete
Axthelm. University of Nebraska, $12. This is both a chronicle of
the New York Knicks' 1969-70 championship season and a study of the
era's playground basketball culture, focusing on asphalt legends
like Herman ``Helicopter'' Knowings and Earl Manigault. ``The book
offers absorbing insights into the most unique and gripping of all
city sports,'' Rex Lardner wrote in 1970.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; CAESAR: LET THE DICE FLY &LR;  By Colleen McCullough. Avon, $16.50.
The author's fifth novel in her series on the fall of the Roman
Republic features the uprising of Gaul and Caesar's crossing of the
Rubicon, among other episodes. ``Such important events ... unfold
as excitingly as if the history were not yet written,'' Allen
Lincoln wrote in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; UNFINISHED JOURNEY: TWENTY YEARS LATER &LR;  By Yehudi Menuhin.
Fromm, $19. In this revamped edition of his 1976 autobiography, the
renowned violinist, who died this month at the age of 82, holds
forth on his precocious musical education (he made his debut at 7)
and his long, eventful career. ``Menuhin is ... a giant above us
all when he talks about music,'' Peggy Constantine wrote in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; SPENDING: A UTOPIAN DIVERTIMENTO &LR;  By Mary Gordon. Scribner,
$13. In this modern fairy tale, a middle-aged painter adopts a
sexually dynamic futures trader as her muse, prompting a struggle
between her artistic purity and the pleasures of the flesh (and the
wallet). ``Gordon is an honest and perceptive writer,'' Hilary
Mantel wrote last year.
