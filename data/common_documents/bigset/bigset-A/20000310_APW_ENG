<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Richard Byrd, a pastor and an activist,
believes in the power of prayer. He also believes in the power of
the business meeting, the grant proposal and the politician's
handshake.
</P>
<P>
   Byrd is at the forefront of a post-civil rights style of
activism that balances traditional, TV-friendly rallies with
behind-the-scenes partnerships and policy research that are helping
redefine, albeit gradually, some neglected California
neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   ''We understand that the key changes that affect our community
are policy changes,'' Byrd said during an interview in his cramped
church office at Christ Unity Center.
</P>
<P>
   Byrd is president and co-founder with Eugene Williams of Los
Angeles Metropolitan Churches. The organization is made up of 40
mostly black churches, each with 150 to 200 congregants, centered
in South Central, a neighborhood that has come to symbolize urban
blight.
</P>
<P>
   Byrd, Williams and Metropolitan Churches were the force behind
the GED Initiative, a state law that requires nonviolent offenders
in two county courts to study toward high school equivalency
diplomas before earning probation. They count the pilot law as
their most visible success.
</P>
<P>
   The idea behind it is simple: Give inmates a chance to learn to
read, write and fill out a job application, and they'll opt out of
the crime cycle that sends 70 percent of California offenders back
to prison.
</P>
<P>
   At the bill signing on Sept. 15, 1998, Byrd and Williams shook
hands with then-Gov. Pete Wilson, a conservative Republican. An odd
partnership, perhaps, but politics was not their concern. They
simply knew he was the man to get them what they wanted.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have no permanent friends, we have no permanent enemies,''
Williams said. ''We just have permanent interests.''
</P>
<P>
   Byrd and his fellow pastors in Metropolitan Churches have lots
of interests. They want to turn toxin-laced lots in South Central
into children's parks, church halls into computer-equipped tutoring
centers, parents into education reformers.
</P>
<P>
   They created a model for action with the GED initiative.
</P>
<P>
   The lobbying wasn't easy. The men struggled to get the ear of
County Supervisor Yvonne Brathwaite-Burke and District Attorney Gil
Garcetti. Their organization's members met with Garcetti's staffers
late in 1995, but afterward heard little from them. And
Brathwaite-Burke agreed to attend a group meeting in October 1997,
then did not.
</P>
<P>
   The organization's response?
</P>
<P>
   About 250 members showed up in front of Garcetti's office for a
prayer vigil and rally. Within months, he had drafted a bill. And
at the meeting Brathwaite-Burke missed, an empty chair with her
name on it was placed on the dais as TV cameras rolled. The
supervisor was at the next meeting, agreeing to support the
churches group.
</P>
<P>
   ''Politicians and bureaucrats have experienced this community as
a toothless tiger,'' Byrd said.
</P>
<P>
   As for the Metropolitan Churches, Garcetti acknowledged, ''They
keep our feet to the fire.''
</P>
<P>
   Some black ministers say the organization's overtures to
conservative leaders are dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   ''If we're in the ministry and we're out to lead the people, we
need to be careful who we go to bed with,'' said Leonid Jackson,
associate minister at Los Angeles' First AME Church, which is not
part of the organization. ''We need to step back and think first of
all before we make a stand on an issue and make sure that we speak
with one voice.''
</P>
<P>
   The organization's members believe they are single-voiced and
single-minded about their goals.
</P>
<P>
   Byrd and Williams are talking to the Los Angeles Unified School
District about setting up student tutoring centers at member
churches.
</P>
<P>
   ''Those churches support some of the most difficult areas in the
district, people in the hardest situations,'' said Ron Prescott, a
deputy school superintendent. ''That's where a lot of us ought to
be.''
</P>
<P>
   Byrd is also exploring environmental concerns in South Central.
He wants to identify ''brown spaces,'' former industrial sites that
have become polluted, and turn them into parks. He would like to
see industries held liable financially.
</P>
<P>
   Those plans are at the conceptual stage, he acknowledges, but he
says the organization focuses on the long run. Some outsiders
agree.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's an organization that is very sophisticated in terms of
its organizing strategies,'' said Don Miller, director of the
University of Southern California's Center for Religion and Civic
Culture, which is documenting the organization's work. ''They not
only affect legislation, but people are learning the skills of
citizenship. Rather than being marginalized, they are finding a
political voice. That's very powerful in a community like South
Central.''

Tijuana Officers Eyed in Chief Slay
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   TIJUANA, Mexico (AP) -- The gangland-style assassination of Tijuana's police
chief may have been ordered by two of his officers, Mexican prosecutors said
Thursday. Baja California Attorney General Juan Manuel Salazar had said earlier
that the six people arrested in the murder of Police Chief Alfredo de la Torre
were suspected of carrying out the killing at the behest of a drug trafficker.
But he said Thursday that their testimony had led investigators to believe that
an assistant police chief and a police officer orchestrated the shooting, then
fled to the United States.

Tuvalu School Fire Kills 19
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   SUVA, Fiji (AP) -- Fire swept through a locked dormitory at a high school in
the South Pacific nation of Tuvalu Thursday night, killing 18 teen-age girls and
their supervisor, a government spokesman said. The fire was believed to have
been caused by a student's candle that toppled over in the girls' dormitory at
the Motufoua Secondary School. The dorm was an old wooden building whose door
had been fastened shut and whose open windows were covered in wire mesh. The
girls, ranging between 14 and 17 years old, were locked inside their rooms when
the fire broke out, Radio Tuvalu reporter Diana Semi told Australia's National
Nine News.

Gore Easily Wins S.C. Caucus
</SUBHEAD>

   COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) -- Vice President Al Gore won South Carolina's Democratic
caucus vote Thursday night, an event that became largely irrelevant after Bill
Bradley dropped out. Bradley quit the race earlier in the day after Gore's Super
Tuesday blowout in 15 states. Although party officials said they did not have a
complete breakdown of delegates, Gore appeared well on his way to winning all 43
of the delegates at stake in the precinct caucuses. With 72 percent of precincts
reporting, Gore had 6,936 votes to 143 for Bradley.

Moscow Jet Crash Kills Nine
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- A private passenger jet crashed today while taking off from
Moscow's main airport, killing all nine aboard including an oil company
president and a journalist who did work for CBS' ''60 Minutes,'' officials and
media said. Artyom Borovik, a well known Moscow journalist, was also a special
Moscow correspondent and interpreter for ''60 Minutes,'' appearing on the show
four times between 1991 and 1995. The Yak-40 aircraft, on a charter flight from
Moscow to Kiev, rose to an altitude of about 150 feet, then plunged to the
ground just beyond the end of the runway, officials said. There was no
indication what caused the crash, they said.

Microbe May Cause Toxic Runoff
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A super bug that eats iron and can thrive in the
equivalent of battery acid may be a major culprit in causing toxic metal and
acid runoff from a California mine, researchers say. Katrina J. Edwards, a
geomicrobiologist at Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, said the
previously-unknown microbe lives on left over iron-rich minerals and sulfide in
a California mine. It gives off sulfuric acid, a chemical that leaches heavy
metals and causes deadly concentrations of acid-metal pollution in mine runoff.

   NEW YORK (AP) -- Bootsy Thornton scored 21 points and third-seeded St.
John's, which blew a 15-point second-half lead, scored the game's final six
points for a 75-70 victory over Villanova on Thursday night in the quarterfinals
of the Big East tournament. The 19th-ranked Red Storm (22-7) advanced to Friday
night's semifinals against second-seeded Miami (21-9), which beat Notre Dame
61-58 in the quarterfinals. That will be a rematch of last week's regular-season
finale, won by Miami 74-70 in overtime, and of last season's semifinal, won
62-59 by St. John's.

<HEADLINE> Japan Current Account Surplus Down  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO (AP) -- Japan's broadest measure of trade fell in January
for the 12th straight month to its lowest level in two years, the
government announced Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The January drop in the current account surplus from the same
month last year was caused by a rise in oil prices and the yen's
strengthening against the dollar, the Finance Ministry said.
</P>
<P>
   The surplus, measured before adjustment for seasonal factors,
declined 22.8 percent to $5.76 billion (610.9 billion yen), the
ministry said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the surplus was larger than expected. A survey of
economists by Dow Jones Newswires predicted a surplus of just $4.95
billion. Analysts attributed the discrepancy to a
greater-than-expected decline in imports in January, following a
surge in December amid worries of shortages caused by possible Y2K
computer problems.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, however, the surplus fell because of a 126.3 percent
jump in the price of crude oil in January from a year earlier to
$25.70 per barrel. That helped boost the total value of Japan's
imports by 11.9 percent from a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the yen's 7 percent rise against the dollar cut the
value of Japanese exports by reducing the price of goods in yen
terms. The dollar traded at an average 105.16 yen in January, down
from 113.18 yen a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   ''Export values are being deflated and oil prices are causing
import values to grow, and that's hurting the surplus,'' said
Matthew Poggi, an economist at Lehman Brothers (Japan) Ltd.
</P>
<P>
   He added that the surplus will probably continue to fall over
the next few months as imports rise and oil prices remain higher
than their year earlier levels.
</P>
<P>
   ''The pace might slow a bit but the current account will
continue to fall,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The current account measures trade in merchandise, services,
tourism and investment. It is calculated by determining the
difference between Japan's income from foreign sources against
payments on foreign obligations. It excludes net capital
investment.
</P>
<P>
   A huge surplus has been a constant source of friction with the
United States and other trading partners. They have been urging
Japan to boost its economy to stimulate imports. Japan is
struggling to emerge from its worst economic downturn in 50 years.
</P>
<P>
   The ministry said last month that the surplus for all of 1999
fell 22.7 percent to $111.9 billion (12.197 trillion yen) from the
previous year's record high.

<HEADLINE> No. 6 Temple 71, Virginia Tech 52  </HEADLINE>
By ROB MAADDI, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- The Temple Owls sent a subtle message to the
Big East Conference. The Big East may send more teams to the NCAA
tournament this season, but Big East-bound Virginia Tech will not
be among them.
</P>
<P>
   No. 6 Temple made sure of it by eliminating the Hokies from the
Atlantic 10 Conference Tournament with a 71-52 victory on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's nice to beat a team that's leaving,'' Temple coach John
Chaney said. ''You don't want to lose to them.''
</P>
<P>
   Virginia Tech (16-15) will play in the Big East Conference next
season, leaving the A-10 with 11 teams.
</P>
<P>
   Temple (24-5) hasn't won the A-10 tournament since 1990, but
Chaney doesn't care. Losing, he said, might even be a good thing
because it would force the Owls to focus more heading into the
NCAA's and would let another A-10 team earn an automatic bid.
</P>
<P>
   ''What's important this time of year is to be making progress,''
he said. ''I want them to work hard together and to win together
and, at one point, break bread together.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite Chaney's feelings, the Owls weren't in a charitable mood
against Virginia Tech.
</P>
<P>
   ''I know what Coach said, but I still want to win and I want us
to have momentum going into the tournament,'' said Quincy Wadley,
who scored eight points.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Karcher scored 17 points and Pepe Sanchez added nine points
and five assists as Temple advanced to a semifinal game against
Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   ''Don't look at us as if we haven't done anything or been
anywhere,'' Chaney said. ''How many times have we won this
tournament before? Five. How many teams have been to the final
eight as many times as Temple?''
</P>
<P>
   Temple, which has reached the final eight four times in the last
12 years, lost 62-59 at the buzzer to Rhode Island in the A-10
championship last year. It's a low point his players remember all
too well, and want to erase from their minds this year.
</P>
<P>
   ''Last year really hurt,'' Karcher said. ''I want to win. We all
want to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Virginia Tech (16-15), stayed close early, but couldn't overcome
a pair of 9-0 Temple runs.
</P>
<P>
   The Hokies, again playing without suspended scoring and
rebounding leader Dennis Mims, trailed 36-22 at halftime and got no
closer than 11 in the second half.
</P>
<P>
   Mims, who averaged 14.2 points, 7.6 rebounds and made 52.6
percent of his shots during the season, was suspended before the
tournament for violating unspecified team rules and did not
accompany the team to Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   Sanchez was 3-for-3 from 3-point range, had five rebounds, three
steals and only one turnover.
</P>
<P>
   ''I try to do all the little things that make a player
valuable,'' Sanchez said. ''It's a trade off for running the team,
being an extension of my coach.''
</P>
<P>
   Temple, 9-0 against Virginia Tech, attempted 27 3-pointers,
including 15 on its 25 shots in the first half. The Owls hit 10.
Virginia Tech was 8-of-23 from 3-point range.
</P>
<P>
   ''I thought they shot the ball well all day, and from the
perimeter too,'' Hokies coach Ricky Stokes said. ''They're really
tough on the boards.''
</P>
<P>
   Brian Chase led the Hokies with 16 points and Brandon Dunlop
added 12.
</P>
<P>
   ''It seems like they had more than five guys out there,'' Chase
said after struggling against Temple's matchup zone, committing
five turnovers with one assist.

<HEADLINE> Gore Easily Wins S.C. Caucus  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) -- Vice President Al Gore won South
Carolina's Democratic caucus vote Thursday night, an event that
became largely irrelevant after Bill Bradley dropped out.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley quit the race earlier in the day after Gore's Super
Tuesday blowout in 15 states.
</P>
<P>
   Although party officials said they did not have a complete
breakdown of delegates, Gore appeared well on his way to winning
all 43 of the delegates at stake in the precinct caucuses.
</P>
<P>
   With 72 percent of precincts reporting, Gore had 6,936 votes to
143 for Bradley. The category 'uncommitted' had 370 votes while
William Kreml, a little-known third candidate had 70.
</P>
<P>
   State Democratic Party Chairman Dick Harpootlian had called it
''an irrelevant event.''
</P>
<P>
   The sparsely attended caucuses stood in sharp contrast to the
state's Republican primary last month, which drew a record 573,000
voters at a pivotal time in John McCain's challenge to front-runner
George W. Bush. McCain lost South Carolina and went on to
widespread losses in Tuesday's voting. He suspended his campaign
Thursday, just after Bradley quit the Democratic race.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley, who didn't win any states, endorsed Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Going into the caucus, the AP's delegate count showed Gore had
1,479 delegates to 414 for Bradley, with 2,170 needed for the
nomination.

<HEADLINE> 9 NBC Stations Won't Air New Sitcom  </HEADLINE>
By LYNN ELBER, AP Television Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- At least nine NBC stations have decided not
to air the network's new animated comedy ''God, the Devil and Bob''
because of the subject matter, and the series is also drawing
criticism from a religious advocacy group.
</P>
<P>
   The series, which premiered Thursday and was then to settle into
a Tuesday night time slot, centers on Bob, an everyman, and the
moral questions he faces. Bob meets God in a bar.
</P>
<P>
   TV stations in Boise, Pocatello and Twin Falls, Idaho; Salt Lake
City; Tupelo, Hattiesburg and Jackson, Miss.; Shreveport, La.; and
South Bend, Ind., have refused to air the program. NBC has more
than 220 affiliates nationally.
</P>
<P>
   ''This kind of tasteless and trivial portrayal of God does a
disservice to the millions of American television viewers who have
deeply felt religious beliefs,'' Nihad Awad, executive director of
the Council on American-Islamic Relations, said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   NBC responded that the series ''deals with the moral dilemma of
good vs. evil in each episode. As such, it follows in the long
tradition of entertainment vehicles that comedically depict this
universal struggle. It was never our intention to offend anyone.''
</P>
<P>
   Matthew Carlson, the series' creator and a former seminary
student, said the reaction by the council and the NBC stations was
unwarranted. He said viewers have the right to judge for
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ''I can understand it's a sensitive issue, but we took that into
account when we made the series,'' he said. ''I think the show
comes out on the side of the angels. I like to think we're laughing
with God, not at him.''
</P>
<P>
   Some stations refusing to carry the show had sought to broadcast
it in late-night hours, but NBC said the program must be aired in
its regular time slot or not at all. The Salt Lake City and
Pocatello stations have sold the sitcom to affiliates of competing
networks, where they will air Sunday nights.
</P>
<P>
   ''Even though it's a cartoon, it's not a kids' program,'' said
Doug Armstrong, president and general manager of KTVB in Boise.
''It has adult humor and themes, yet the marketing seems geared
toward younger kids. Kids and families are our priority so we have
asked NBC to schedule the program later in the evening.''
</P>
<P>
   He cited the show's tongue-in-cheek humor and drinking and
sexual references.
</P>
<P>
   KTVB has asked the network to air the program Saturdays at
midnight, following ''Saturday Night Live.'' Armstrong said calls
to the station are running 10-to-1 in favor of his decision.
</P>
<P>
   The network said in a statement that it considers the show
entertaining and that it hopes the affiliates eventually will agree
to broadcast it.
</P>
<P>
   One of the stations, KSL in Salt Lake City, also refuses to air
''Saturday Night Live'' because of its content.

<TEXT>
<P>
	   UTICA, N.Y. (AP) -- Two more teen-agers have been charged in
connection with eight fires that blazed through the same inner-city
neighborhood since last Friday, police said.
</P>
<P>
   One, 16-year-old Curtis M. Lee of Utica, was charged as an adult
with five counts of third-degree arson and one count of
fourth-degree arson. Lee was believed to be involved in several
fires including one early Saturday that spread to an adjacent home
after a vacant building was torched, Deputy Police Chief Nicholas
Yagey said.
</P>
<P>
   The other suspect, a 14-year-old male, was charged with one
count of third-degree arson for his alleged role in a fire Monday
at another abandoned home. Like the 14- and 15-year-old boys
arrested Wednesday and charged with arson, he will be treated as a
juvenile and his case will be resolved in Oneida County Family
Court, Yagey said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The investigation is still continuing,'' he said. ''There's a
few more we have to talk to. It's moving along quite well.''
</P>
<P>
   Lee was arraigned Thursday morning and sent to Oneida County
jail on $30,000 bail, pending a felony hearing Tuesday in Utica
City Court.
</P>
<P>
   Third-degree arson is a felony punishable by up to 15 years in
prison. The charge is not an offense that allows juveniles under
the age of 16 to be tried as adults, Assistant District Attorney
Mike Coluzza said.
</P>
<P>
   If the three juveniles in the case plead guilty or are found
guilty in a fact-finding hearing before a Family Court judge, they
might be placed in ''secure custody,'' said Rose Cirillo of the
Oneida County Attorney's Office.
</P>
<P>
   The Oneida County Probation Office will make a sentencing
recommendation to the court following an investigation into the
circumstances of the crime and the boys' background, Cirillo said.
</P>
<P>
   ''They can be placed in detention, in a foster home, or receive
probation,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, Utica demolished 100 abandoned buildings with the help
of the Army National Guard in an effort to stem a string of arsons.
Also that year, the federal government helped set up the Utica
Arson Strike Force, which combines federal, state and local
investigative resources to probe suspicious fires.

<HEADLINE> Federal agency says Rome firm deserved shot at Griffiss cleanupwork  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ROME, N.Y. (AP) -- James Ocuto now believes: The system does
work, at least some of the time.
</P>
<P>
   Ocuto, owner of Ocuto Blacktop and Paving Co. of Rome, had
questioned the methods of the Army Corps of Engineers in not using
local contractors for work at the former Griffiss Air Force Base
since it was closed five years ago.
</P>
<P>
   In particular, Ocuto protested to the federal General Accounting
Office last year when the Corps of Engineers selected Cape
Environmental Management Inc. of Illinois to cap a 19.6-acre
landfill and install a system to protect the local water supply
from contamination.
</P>
<P>
   Ocuto said the decision violated a federal law that requires the
Corps to give bidding preference on projects at closed military
bases to businesses in the vicinity of those bases.
</P>
<P>
   The GAO agreed and recommended that the Corps review how it goes
about awarding bids on closed bases. It also said the Corps should
reimburse Ocuto for his expenses in pursuing the protest.
</P>
<P>
   ''We could use the work, plain and simple,'' Ocuto said. ''We've
done work at Griffiss for 25 years. And it upsets us that after 25
years we aren't even allowed to bid. We don't want any handouts. We
just want an opportunity to bid.''
</P>
<P>
   GAO attorney Ralph White, who worked on the case, said Thursday
that ''the Corps had not made a good argument for doing what it was
doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Ocuto said the decision does not guarantee a local business will
get the work, but ''it gives us a chance. In the end it will save
taxpayers money.''
</P>
<P>
   ''It's nice to know the system does work,'' Ocuto said. ''It
means local contractors will get to bid on contracts in the county
and that the money will stay local.
</P>
<P>
   Ocuto said he does not know exactly how much he spent, but
figured it was in the ''tens of thousands'' of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Michael McDermott, environmental coordinator for the Griffiss
cleanup, said the GAO decision, reached last week, means the
landfill work on the north side of the former base will be set back
at least a year. The original schedule called for the work to be
done by the fall of 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Carl Sahre, spokesman for the Air Force Base Conversion Agency,
which oversees the local environmental work, said the agency had no
role in selecting the Illinois firm. He said because the contract
was never formally awarded and the cost was never made public.
Sahre termed it ''a multimillion-dollar project.''
</P>
<P>
   McDermott said the delay will not affect any other aspect of the
base closure procedure, nor will it impact plans to turn the
property over to local control in the next several years.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the Army Corps of Engineers said the agency
believes it gave all businesses an equal opportunity to bid on the
Griffiss work, but it will abide by the GAO decision.

<HEADLINE> Group: Law enforcement officials like preventative programs  </HEADLINE>
By JOEL STASHENKO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- It is smarter to spend thousands of dollars
on programs for at-risk youngsters than hundreds of thousands to
prosecute and incarcerate the hardened criminals some of them will
become, a group new to New York says.
</P>
<P>
   A group called ''Fight Crime: Invest in Kids'' said it has
formed a New York chapter to fight for more public funding for day
care, pre-kindergarten and after-school programs.
</P>
<P>
   The group's New York director, Jack Kennedy, said Thursday the
programs not only make sense socially, but also from the standpoint
of getting involved positively in children's lives early in hopes
of steering them away from paths which lead to crime, substance
abuse and other problems as they get older.
</P>
<P>
   More than 50 law enforcement officials from around the state
have joined Kennedy's group and he said he expected others to
follow suit.
</P>
<P>
   John Grebert, chief of police in the suburban Albany town of
Colonie, said a Rand Corp. study found that the benefits of early
education programs exceeds by two to four times their cost.
</P>
<P>
   ''By the time your worst offenders begin having contact with
police, the damage is often done on a permanent basis,'' he said at
a news conference.
</P>
<P>
   The law enforcement officials said people who become the worst
criminals typically start to have serious brushes with the law when
they are 12, 13 or 14.
</P>
<P>
   Niagara County Sheriff Thomas Beilein said his county just spent
$24.6 million to build a new jail, where it will cost taxpayers $75
to $85 a day to house inmates. Using those numbers, pre-K and day
care programs costing $9,000 to $12,000 a year can look like a huge
bargain, if they succeed at keeping kids from becoming criminals
down the line, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The more families we help early on, the less criminals we'll
have later on,'' Beilein said.
</P>
<P>
   The group urged that the state Legislature and Gov. George
Pataki commit $225 million in the next fiscal year for pre-K
programs, or about $105 million more than Pataki is proposing. It
is also advocating more state spending on after-school programs to
keep older kids out of trouble between the time school ends and
their parent or parents get home from work.
</P>
<P>
   The group's spending recommendations largely parallel those
advanced in recent years by Democrats in the state Assembly.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Pataki, Joseph Conway, said the Republican
governor is well aware of the value of day care, pre-K and
after-school problems and has reflected that in his 2000-01 state
budget proposal.
</P>
<P>
   ''The governor's budget increases funding in all of these
areas,'' Conway said.
</P>
<P>
   Juvenile crime rates triple on school days between 3 p.m. and 6
p.m., Rensselaer County District Attorney Kenneth Bruno said.
</P>
<P>
   ''You have to find reasons for these kids to want to stay in
school,'' Bruno said. ''You have to find reasons for kids to
participate in after-school programs.''
</P>
<P>
   The group also released a survey of law enforcement officials in
New York conducted by two professors at George Mason University in
Virginia. Questionnaires were sent out to 61 district attorneys, 57
sheriffs and 296 chiefs of police whose departments have 10 or more
officers and the statisticians got 53 percent back.
</P>
<P>
   The survey found that when asked to name the most effective
strategy for dealing with youth crime, the officers overwhelmingly
-- 74 percent -- said more effective after-school and child-care
programs.
</P>
<P>
   Reactive responses like hiring more police officers to
investigate juveniles (15 percent), prosecute more juveniles as
adults (10 percent) and install metal detectors or surveillance
cameras in schools were far less popular.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a lot easier to prevent than it is to investigate, arrest
and prosecute,'' Bruno said.

<HEADLINE> Pataki launches $4 million taxpayer-funded ad campaign  </HEADLINE>
By JOEL STASHENKO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- Gov. George Pataki is appearing in a new $4
million series of television ads paid for by taxpayers which
promotes his tax-cutting record and urges companies to do business
in New York.
</P>
<P>
   The ads are being funded through the Empire State Development
Corp. and the New York Power Authority and are designed to attract
businesses to New York or to get companies already here to expand.
</P>
<P>
   The commercials started airing Feb. 21, Empire State Development
spokesman Eric Mangan said Thursday. They will be shown through
March 19 on stations in all major New York markets, as well as in
Baltimore, Boston, Cleveland, Hartford, New Haven, Conn.,
Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, Washington, Montreal and Toronto.
</P>
<P>
   The ads will also appear on the national cable networks CNBC and
CNNFN.
</P>
<P>
   Mangan said that after a pause later this month, the commercials
will return from April 3 to April 23.
</P>
<P>
   ''The purpose of the ads is to have companies expanding and
creating new jobs for New Yorkers,'' Mangan said. ''We want to get
out the message that New York is the place to do business.''
</P>
<P>
   The ads feature one of either three New York companies -- New
Venture Gear, General Composites and Reciprocal -- and describe what
the administration says is their success stories at being in New
York. They all also show Pataki giving a personal invitation for
companies to call his administration to find out more about New
York.
</P>
<P>
   Mangan denied that the appearance of the ads has to do with an
anti-Pataki ad campaign which began earlier this year from
Change-New York, a conservative anti-tax group once allied with the
governor. Those ads complain about population losses and the
allegedly anemic job-creation figures under Pataki's
administration.
</P>
<P>
   Change-New York, whose board consists of wealthy New York City
financiers, has also started to question Pataki's identity as a
tax-cutter.
</P>
<P>
   Mangan said the Pataki administration ads have been in
production for months, well before the Change-New York commercials
started airing, in anticipation of the positive job-creation
numbers Pataki revealed last week.
</P>
<P>
   But Change-New York spokesman Brian Backstrom contended that the
Pataki administration ads were indeed designed to counter the
Change-New York ads.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think clearly the governor feels the need to improve his
public image,'' Backstrom said Thursday. ''Unfortunately, he is
trying to alter reality and use selective data to do so, all at
taxpayer expense.''
</P>
<P>
   Change-New York president Tom Carroll said the Pataki ads would
more appropriately be funded out of the governor's campaign fund.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki argues that Change-New York is distorting his record at
fostering job growth and improving economic opportunities in New
York. He released figures last week showing that New York gained
200,000 full- and part-time private sector jobs in 1999. Job growth
was at a rate higher than the national average for the first time
in more than a decade, Pataki said.
</P>
<P>
   Empire State Development, headed by close Pataki supporter
Charles Gargano, runs the administration's business-promotion
efforts. The Power Authority is chaired by his one-time political
mentor in the state Assembly, Clarence Rappleyea. Both supporters
were appointed by Pataki.

<HEADLINE> Republicans say they're thinking about changing future GOP prezprimaries  </HEADLINE>
By JESSE J. HOLLAND, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- For more than three months, New York's
Republican Party has been the focus of criticism for what many saw
as the nation's most baffling presidential primary ballot.
</P>
<P>
   But now that George W. Bush has captured the bulk of New York's
presidential delegates, some Republican leaders on Thursday said
they are looking to change the way future GOP presidential leaders
are chosen.
</P>
<P>
   ''I believe there was too much confusion,'' powerful GOP Senate
Majority Leader Joseph Bruno said. ''We in the Senate are going to
move diligently to correct a system that we think is faulty.''
</P>
<P>
   Not only were Republicans voting for delegates instead of for
presidential candidates, the only way voters could figure out which
delegate represented which candidate was to look at the tiny print
that was under each delegate's name.
</P>
<P>
   However, bringing about change now that the next presidential
primary is four years away may not be easy. ''We have plenty of
time to deal with issues that are four years down the road,'' said
Michael McKeon, spokesman for Gov. George Pataki.
</P>
<P>
   A change to the ballot that gives the party a way to control
which GOP presidential candidate gets the lion's share of New
York's 101 presidential delegates also isn't a priority for state
GOP Chairman William Powers.
</P>
<P>
   ''We'll look at it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   McKeon said Pataki's focus now will be on getting Bush elected
president, New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani elected U.S.
senator and getting a ''fiscally responsible'' budget past the
state Legislature. But, ''the governor is always open to good
ideas,'' McKeon added.
</P>
<P>
   Bruno on Thursday didn't give details of what changes he would
propose but earlier said he would advocate making the names of the
candidates larger and more prominent on the ballot so people won't
be confused about who they are voting for.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Rep. Peter King of Long Island, one of the few well-known
state Republicans backing Sen. John McCain's now suspended
presidential bid, said on primary day that his office got about 100
telephone calls from angry New Yorkers who had just voted on
ballots listing delegates' names in larger print than McCain's.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was so confusing, you couldn't even find Senator McCain's
name with a magnifying glass,'' King said. ''They were afraid they
voted the wrong way or they said it really shook them up when they
got in there. The Republican Party looks absolutely stupid, and
that reflects on the leaders of our party if they continue this
kind of behavior.''
</P>
<P>
   The Republican primary ballot in New York is constructed to give
party leaders control over which national candidate gets the most
support. The state GOP backed Bush in the primary.
</P>
<P>
   To ensure he got most of the support from Republican voters, the
Bush delegate slates were often filled with elected state
Republican officials such as Bruno, U.S. Rep. John Sweeney and Lt.
Gov. Mary Donohue. To vote for McCain, New Yorkers often had to
turn against their local officials. Although some did, Bush won at
least 67 of the 93 delegates at stake in the primary.
</P>
<P>
   Powers said he wasn't opposed to ballot changes. GOP lawyer Jeff
Buley said the party's primary ballot had gotten better. As
recently as 1980, the GOP ballots only listed the delegates and not
who they were supporting, Buley said.
</P>
<P>
   ''You had to do research before you went in to vote,'' Buley
said.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans are also considering changes to the rules for
getting on the ballot. McCain needed the help of a federal judge to
get his slates on the ballot everywhere in the state after party
leaders tried to use the state's complicated election rules to keep
his delegates off.
</P>
<P>
   Powers refused to take the blame for that, saying current
primary rules were put in place after the party was successfully
sued in 1994 over ballot access. ''They weren't my rules,'' Powers
said. ''They were the Second Circuit Court of Appeals' rules.''

<HEADLINE> Senate developing legislation on unwanted babies  </HEADLINE>
By LYNN BREZOSKY, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- In an age when the bodies of unwanted babies
are turning up in trash bins, bathroom stalls, and wooded patches,
Senate Republicans say it may be time to allow mothers to leave
their babies with responsible parties and dodge criminal charges.
</P>
<P>
   ''Far too often, confused young mothers believe that they have
no other option but to abandon their newborn out of fear or
desperation,'' Senate Majority Leader Joseph Bruno said. ''We must
find ways to assure them that there are other options and safe
places for them to deliver their babies without fear of arrest.''
</P>
<P>
   Under state law, child abandonment is a Class E felony,
punishable by one to four years in prison. The challenge for
lawmakers is drafting legislation that allows mothers an out
without creating loopholes for child abuse and people who
intentionally kill infants, Bruno said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The responsibility of people in law enforcement is to
prosecute and defend the rights of children,'' said Sen. Nancy
Larraine Hoffmann, a Syracuse-area Republican. ''On the other hand,
when you look at it as a social issue ... the responsibility of
saving the life of the infants requires that we're meeting that
woman on her own terms.''
</P>
<P>
   Hoffmann became involved in the issue of child abandonment as a
Syracuse city councilor in the early 1981, when within a short
period of time three infants were found abandoned and dead in
Syracuse.
</P>
<P>
   With the involvement of local hospitals and the cooperation of
the district attorney in Onondaga and several surrounding counties,
she helped launch a program that offers ''Jane Doe'' admissions for
mothers about to give birth. Hotline numbers to inform expectant
mothers of their options were advertised in a local media campaign,
and prosecutors agreed not to pursue criminal action against
mothers who gave their unwanted babies up. The services still
continue.
</P>
<P>
   Any state-level effort would likely involve local district
attorneys, who would have to agree not to prosecute. The cost of
caring for the infants would have to be absorbed somehow with Bruno
pledging Thursday not to make it an unfunded mandate for
localities.
</P>
<P>
   Bruno's son, Rensselaer County District Attorney Kenneth Bruno,
said he would lead an effort in his own region to initiate a pilot
program similar to the one in central New York.
</P>
<P>
   Denise Ayers, public health director for Rensselaer County,
pledged to help.
</P>
<P>
   ''I see the babies that are dumped and I do the autopsies,''
Ayers said.
</P>
<P>
   Federal statistics show that unwanted babies are turning up dead
at an increasing and alarming rate. Of 105 known abandoned babies
in 1998, 33 were found dead. In 1991, 65 babies were left in public
places and eight died.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-three states are currently considering measures to exempt
parents of newborns from prosecution for abandonment or child
cruelty if they leave a baby in a safe place. In September, Texas
became the first state to pass such a measure into law.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, 24-year-old Melissa Strawbridge of Altamont, a
rural town less than 20 miles west of Albany, was convicted of
suffocating her baby after giving birth at her parents' home in
March 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Strawbridge was found guilty of second-degree murder and
first-degree manslaughter and faces a minimum of 15 years in prison
when she is sentenced March 31.
</P>
<P>
   ''She could not and would not tell her parents that she was
pregnant right up until she delivered her baby, unfortunately in
the toilet bowl,'' the younger Bruno said. ''Law enforcement got
involved ... and by that time it was too late to do anything other
than punish the young girl.''

<HEADLINE> State reports highways safer, despite 65 mph speed limit  </HEADLINE>
By JOEL STASHENKO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- Allowing drivers to go faster on some
highways has not raised the number of accidents they are getting
into or the injuries or fatalities they are suffering, new state
statistics show.
</P>
<P>
   The state Department of Transportation reported Thursday that
fatal accidents decreased by 29 percent in the three years
following the 1995 hike in the speed limit from 55 mph to 65 mph
compared with the last three years of the lower limit on the same
roads.
</P>
<P>
   The department also said the injury rate in accidents on those
roads went down by 5 percent and the total number of accidents
dipped by 4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The numbers were based on the 1,181 miles of highways around the
state where the speed limit went to 65 mph, including the New York
State Thruway.
</P>
<P>
   A state DOT spokesman said the department also studied
comparable highways where the speed limit stayed 55 mph after 1995.
The overall accident rate stayed the same in the three years after
the speed limit went up elsewhere and the fatality rate rose
slightly, spokesman Michael Fleischer said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We knew that changing the speed limit in certain places was
simply a matter of common sense,'' said Gov. George Pataki, who
signed legislation increasing the speed limit.
</P>
<P>
   State officials credited the injury and fatality statistics on
better compliance with the state's mandatory seat belt law since
1995 and on better enforcement of speeding laws.
</P>
<P>
   ''Safety belts are the single most effective means to avoid
serious injuries or death in the event of a crash, and it is
estimated that three of every five fatally injured crash victims
would have survived had they buckled up,'' State Police
Superintendent James McMahon said.
</P>
<P>
   State police said they have targeted their efforts in recent
years not only on speeders but on aggressive drivers. That has made
roadways safer, too, they said.
</P>
<P>
   The 65 mph speed limit law will expire on Dec. 1, 2000, unless
it is extended by the governor and Legislature. One of the
provisions of the 1995 statute was that the state perform a safety
study of the higher limit to see whether roadways were more
dangerous because of the greater speeds.
</P>
<P>
   State Assembly Majority Leader Michael Bragman, D-Onondaga and
another proponent of the higher limit, said he is not surprised
that the 65 mph has not resulted in more deaths and injuries.
</P>
<P>
   ''I would not have sponsored the bill if I thought it was going
to jeopardize safety,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Bragman said he wanted to take a look at the entire DOT
report before saying more about the success of the higher speed
limit.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to continuing the higher speed limit, another
decision facing lawmakers will be whether to extend the higher
speeds to other roads, Bragman said. New York has about 1,400 miles
worth of limited access highway which now does not have the 65 mph
speed limit, Fleischer said.
</P>
<P>
   Another decision facing lawmakers will be
</P>
<P>
   The DOT also reported:
</P>
<P>
   --The state police issued slightly fewer speeding tickets in the
three years after the higher limit took effect than in the three
years before (797,851 vs. 800,847, or a drop of 0.4 percent.)
Officials said the decline was likely due to the fact that some
motorists who were being caught speeding before the law changed
were no longer being ticketed afterward.
</P>
<P>
   --A higher percentage of commercial vehicles were using the 65
mph highways following the speed limit increase than before -- 30.5
percent vs. 22.4 percent. Truckers and other commercial haulers had
lobbied for an increase in the limit, saying it would improve their
businesses and make New York roadways more attractive for long-haul
truckers.
</P>
<P>
   New York's speed limit was lowered to 55 mph during the fuel
crises of the mid-1970s. When it was increased in 1995, proponents
said the lower speed limit was unrealistic on roadways and for
vehicles which were engineered for faster travel.
</P>
<P>
   Proponents also pointed out that most traffic on limited access
highways where the speed limit was 55 mph was going significantly
faster than the limit anyway.

<HEADLINE> Maple Leafs 6, Flames 2  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CALGARY, Alberta (AP) -- Glenn Healy made 30 saves and also had
an assist Thursday night as the Toronto Maple Leafs inched closer
to the lead in the Eastern Conference with a 6-2 win over the
Calgary Flames.
</P>
<P>
   Toronto, outshot 32-20, got goals from six players en route to
its fourth straight win and eighth in nine games. The Maple Leafs
are within three points of Eastern Conference-leading New Jersey
Devils.
</P>
<P>
   Yanic Perreault, Mats Sundin, and former Flames player Jonas
Hoglund each had a goal and an assist for Toronto. Tie Domi, Steve
Thomas and Sergei Berezin each scored.
</P>
<P>
   Derek Morris and Jason Wiemer had goals for the Flames, who
finished an eight-game homestand 3-3-2.
</P>
<P>
   The Flames, in ninth place in the Western Conference, trail the
San Jose Sharks for the final playoff spot by three points. Calgary
plays at San Jose on Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   For the second straight game, the Flames' undoing came in the
second period.
</P>
<P>
   After giving up four second-period goals Tuesday in an 8-3 loss
to the Colorado Avalanche, the Flames had an even tougher time
against Toronto.
</P>
<P>
   The Leafs scored five goals in the period on just 11 shots to
turn a 1-1 tie into a 6-2 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Hoglund made it 2-1 just 36 seconds in, when his centering pass
banked in off the leg of defenseman Darryl Shannon. Healy was
credited with an assist.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas added a power-play goal at 3:14 before a controversial
call.
</P>
<P>
   At about the four-minute mark, Jarome Iginla fired a shot from
the top of the crease that Healy gloved on the goal line as he slid
across the net.
</P>
<P>
   Referee Dave Jackson was stationed behind the net and chose not
to review the play. However, shortly after play resumed, fans
became angry when video screens repeatedly showed a replay in which
it appeared the puck might have gloved over the line.
</P>
<P>
   The Flames argued with Jackson and second referee Paul Stewart,
but the goal stood.
</P>
<P>
   The Maple Leafs then blew the game open when Perreault scored at
9:00 and Sundin made it three goals on four shots beating Fred
Brathwaite at 10:26.
</P>
<P>
   After Wiemer scored to make it 5-2 at 14:24, Nik Antropov put
Berezin in on a clear breakaway for his 19th goal with 1:46 left in
the second.

19 Perish in South Pacific Fire
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   SUVA, Fiji (AP) -- Eighteen teen-age girls and their supervisor were killed
Thursday when a fire tore through a locked dormitory at a high school in the
South Pacific nation of Tuvalu, a government spokesman said. The fire was
believed to have been caused by a student's candle that toppled over in the
girls' dormitory at the Motufoua Secondary School. The dorm was an old wooden
building whose door had been fastened shut and whose open windows were covered
in wire mesh. The girls, ranging between 14 and 17 years old, were locked inside
their rooms when the fire broke out, Radio Tuvalu reporter Diana Semi told
Australia's National Nine News.

Minimum Wage Hike Passes in House
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The House on Thursday approved a $1 increase in the
minimum wage over two years and a 10-year, $122 billion Republican tax cut. The
vote was 246-179 for a bipartisan amendment boosting the $5.15-an-hour wage by
$1 over two years. The amendment replaced a GOP plan to raise the wage by $1
over three years. Earlier, the House voted 257-169 for the GOP tax bill,
two-thirds of it cuts in estate taxes. Meanwhile, President Clinton vowed to
veto the measure, saying the tax relief disproportionately benefits the wealthy
and would consume a chunk of the projected budget surplus that could be used to
shore up Social Security and Medicare.

Gore Easily Wins S.C. Caucus

   COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) -- Vice President Al Gore won South Carolina's Democratic
caucus vote Thursday night, an event that became largely irrelevant after Bill
Bradley dropped out. Bradley quit the race earlier in the day after Gore's Super
Tuesday blowout in 15 states. Although party officials said they did not have a
complete breakdown of delegates, Gore appeared well on his way to winning all 43
of the delegates at stake in the precinct caucuses. With 72 percent of precincts
reporting, Gore had 6,936 votes to 143 for Bradley.

Microbe May Cause Toxic Runoff
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A super bug that eats iron and can thrive in the
equivalent of battery acid may be a major culprit in causing toxic metal and
acid runoff from a California mine, researchers say. Katrina J. Edwards, a
geomicrobiologist at Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, said the
previously-unknown microbe lives on left over iron-rich minerals and sulfide in
a California mine. It gives off sulfuric acid, a chemical that leaches heavy
metals and causes deadly concentrations of acid-metal pollution in mine runoff.

Miller Offers Plastic-Bottled Brews
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Miller Brewing Co. is going to sell three of its
best-selling beers -- Miller Lite, Miller Genuine Draft and Icehouse --
nationally in 16-ounce and 20-ounce plastic bottles as well as in the
traditional glass bottles and aluminum cans. Scott Bussen, a spokesman for the
Milwaukee-based brewer, said beer in plastic stays cold longer than in aluminum
cans and as long as in glass bottles, it weighs much less than glass and it is
unbreakable. But he conceded that there was ''natural skepticism'' by beer
drinkers to the idea of a plastic beer bottle but said Miller found in the test
markets that the wariness ''tends to melt away'' when they get a chance to hold
the bottle and taste the brew.

Marino's agent, told ESPN.com that Marino had yet to decide whether he would
retire or stay in football, perhaps by accepting an offer from the Minnesota
Vikings. Dolphins president Eddie Jones said the reports that Marino had decided
to retire were news to him.

<HEADLINE> Officer Smith case goes to jury  </HEADLINE>
By DIANE SCARPONI, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LITCHFIELD, Conn. (AP) -- No one disputes that New Milford Police
Officer shot and killed Franklyn Reid after a foot chase in
December, 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Now, a jury must decide if the shooting amounted to murder,
manslaughter or self defense.
</P>
<P>
   Jury deliberations are scheduled to resume today. The jury
deliberated about 2{ hours Thursday, then asked to rehear the
testimony of eight witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   Superior Court Judge Charles Gill told they jury they could also
consider charges of intentional manslaughter or reckless
manslaughter in the death of Reid, 27.
</P>
<P>
   The additional charges came over the objections of Smith's
lawyer. Smith, 27, has claimed he shot in self-defense -- a defense
that would apply to any of the charges he faces.
</P>
<P>
   Smith is the first officer in Connecticut history to be
prosecuted for murder for an on-duty shooting.
</P>
<P>
   In closing arguments Thursday, Waterbury State's Attorney John
Connelly urged jurors to consider the testimony of several
eyewitnesses over the testimony of Smith and his coworkers.
</P>
<P>
   At the time of the shooting, Reid was wanted for failing to
appear in court. He had led police on a short foot chase along
Route 202 before the shooting.
</P>
<P>
   ''Running from police doesn't carry with it the death penalty.
Failure to appear in court doesn't mean the death penalty,'' said
Connelly, who is acting as special prosecutor in the case.
</P>
<P>
   Defense attorney Jack Kelly said Smith was doing his job and
trying not to get killed.
</P>
<P>
   ''The state says Scott Smith conducted a public execution of
Franklyn Reid for no reason -- that's the only conclusion you can
come to if you accept the state's theory,'' Kelly said.
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses reported seeing Smith chase Reid. One witness said he
saw Smith draw his gun and saw Reid sitting down. Another testified
that Smith's foot was on Reid's back just before the shooting.
</P>
<P>
   Evidence from Reid's clothes and autopsy back up this version of
events and contradict Smith's claim that Reid was on his knees and
possibly reaching for a weapon when he fired, Connelly said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Officer Smith let his emotions take over, and because of that,
Franklyn Reid is dead,'' Connelly said in an hour-long argument to
the jury of seven men and five women.
</P>
<P>
   Connelly accused fellow New Milford officers and medical
technicians of changing or omitting facts from their stories to
help Smith's case.
</P>
<P>
   Smith's partner testified he did not see the shooting. An
emergency medical technician who is Smith's neighbor testified he
moved a jacket out of the way to help Reid, but did not mention the
jacket in his initial statement.
</P>
<P>
   Reid was unarmed, but a short folding knife was discovered in
the pocket of the nearby jacket.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly said Smith was a well-trained officer who struggled with
Reid and had reason to fear for his life. Reid was a strong,
violent person who had gone to prison for stabbing someone, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Smith, who took the stand in his own defense earlier this week,
said Reid was twisting around and reaching around his waist. Smith
said he feared Reid had a weapon.
</P>
<P>
   ''Did Scott Smith have to wait for Franklyn Reid to get ahold of
his knife and try to use it on him?'' Kelly asked the jury during
his 50-minute closing argument.

<HEADLINE> Fired CIA Agent To Receive Award  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The former chief of the CIA's Latin American
Division, who was fired in 1995 for failing to inform Congress
about human rights abuses in Guatemala, will be awarded one of the
agency's highest honors this month, according to The Washington
Post.
</P>
<P>
   Terry R. Ward, 62, will receive the Distinguished Career
Intelligence Medal on March 23 for ''exceptional achievements''
during a 30-year covert career, the Post reported in its Friday
editions.
</P>
<P>
   Ward was fired for failing to report on CIA ties to a Guatemalan
colonel linked to two murders in the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Former colleagues within the CIA's Directorate of Operations
recommended Ward's medal, which was then approved by James Pavitt,
the CIA's deputy director for operations, according to an
unidentified intelligence official cited by the Post.
</P>
<P>
   Former CIA Director John M. Deutch fired Ward. Deutch has been
embroiled in his own controversy, after it was discovered he
processed classified documents on unprotected home computers that
he and family members also used to connect to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Some human rights activists and other CIA critics are angry over
the agency's decision to recognize Ward, the Post reported.

<HEADLINE> Fiction in New Anti-Hillary Book  </HEADLINE>
By BETH J. HARPAZ, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- There's a scene in Peggy Noonan's new book,
''The Case Against Hillary Clinton,'' in which the first lady tells
her Hollywood supporters they should censor programming in the
interests of helping children.
</P>
<P>
   Ted Turner interrupts the first lady to tell her off. Clinton
responds with a crack about Jane Fonda visiting the Vietnamese
while John McCain was being held prisoner. And then the writer
wakes up.
</P>
<P>
   ''Because it had all been a dream,'' writes Noonan, a columnist
for The Wall Street Journal and President Reagan's former
speechwriter.
</P>
<P>
   ''It didn't happen. I had fallen asleep and my mind made it up --
some antic little inner Edmund Morris took over my unconscious, and
guided my hungry imaginings,'' she adds, referring to Morris'
controversial biography of Reagan, ''Dutch,'' in which the author
inserted himself as a fictional character.
</P>
<P>
   The passage is one of several imagined portrayals of what
Clinton might say or think if, in Noonan's opinion, she had more
guts, or if she were to win the Senate race in New York.
</P>
<P>
   The book (ReganBooks, $24, available March 22) is the latest in
a truckload of recent works about the first lady, including Gail
Sheehy's ''Hillary's Choice'' and Barbara Olson's ''Hell To Pay.''
Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Carl Bernstein is also working on
one.
</P>
<P>
   Noonan thinks the first lady has a good shot at beating her
Republican rival for the Senate, New York City Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani. And the author also believes Clinton will use the office
as a steppingstone for president -- something Clinton has repeatedly
denied.
</P>
<P>
   If the first lady loses, Noonan believes she may run for Senate
from her native state of Illinois in 2004, or keep her chances for
a White House run open by keeping a high profile working for
children's groups and giving speeches.
</P>
<P>
   ''There came the moment when I realized: 'They're never going to
leave,''' Noonan writes. ''Other presidents and first ladies do
their work, leave their imprint, and make a graceful exit,
departing the stage and attempting to become, if they were not
already, wise, high-minded and fair.
</P>
<P>
   ''But the Clintons -- they'll stay until the last footlight
fizzles and pops, and then we'll have to wrestle them to the floor
of the stage.''
</P>
<P>
   Here's Noonan inside Clinton's head as the first lady savors her
victory in the Senate campaign: ''And now I've won, and I've beaten
more than Rudy. I've beaten Bill. He got it and blew it. Now I'll
show him how it's done.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton spokesman Howard Wolfson hadn't seen the book and had no
comment Thursday. A call to Noonan's literary agent, Joni Evans,
was not returned.
</P>
<P>
   Noonan is upfront about the goal of her book, which is not a
biography but a ''polemic -- an argument for a point of view, in
this case a perspective highly critical of Mrs. Clinton.''
</P>
<P>
   But she says she is not a ''Clinton hater.''
</P>
<P>
   ''There are things I like about Mrs. Clinton, her fortitude and
her resourcefulness being two,'' she writes. ''But I do not wish to
see her succeed in continuing Clintonism in our national life.''

<HEADLINE> No. 9 Arizona 86, No. 2 Stanford 81  </HEADLINE>
By BOB BAUM, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   TUCSON, Ariz. (AP) -- Stanford can beat just about anybody in the
country -- except Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   The ninth-ranked Wildcats used intense pressure defense and a
balanced, aggressive offense in the second half and made it a sweep
of No. 2 Stanford 86-81 Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Jefferson, who broke his right foot in Arizona's 68-65
victory at Stanford Jan. 8 and was scoreless in his first two games
back last week, scored 19 points off the bench for the Wildcats, 13
in the second half.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Wright scored 20 for Arizona (25-6 overall, 14-3
Pac-10). Jason Gardner, named freshman of the year Thursday by the
U.S. Basketball Writers Association, gave the Cardinal fits with
his quickness and finished with 14 points and seven assists.
</P>
<P>
   Luke Walton added 15 points, five in the last four minutes, and
handed out 12 assists. Gilbert Arenas scored 14.
</P>
<P>
   David Moseley scored 14 of his team's points in a row in the
second half and led a late run that cut Arizona's 15-point lead to
84-81, that after Casey Jacobsen's off-balance 3-pointer with 14
seconds to go.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinal (25-3, 14-3) couldn't catch the Wildcats to foul
them and Wright broke loose for a wide-open stuff with nine seconds
to go to clinch Arizona's 29th consecutive homecourt Pac-10
victory.
</P>
<P>
   Jacobsen scored 20 and Mark Madsen had 15 points and 10 rebounds
for Stanford.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona, already without 7-foot-1 Loren Woods for four games
with a back injury, lost Woods' backup, Justin Wessell, with an
ankle injury with 8:02 to play.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona's victory left the teams tied for first in the Pac-10
with one game to go. The Wildcats play host to California in the
regular-season finale on Saturday, while Stanford is at Arizona
State.
</P>
<P>
   If Arizona and Stanford finish as Pac-10 co-champions, the
Wildcats will get the conference's automatic seed by virtue of the
sweep of the Cardinal.
</P>
<P>
   Up 39-37 after scoring the last seven points of the first half,
Arizona clamped on the pressure. Stanford responded with 10
turnovers in the first nine minutes of the second half.
</P>
<P>
   The Wildcats, meanwhile, went on a 12-3 run punctuated by
Walton's two free throws and Arenas' steal and breakaway layup that
put Arizona ahead 57-44 with 13:38 to play.
</P>
<P>
   Another 6-0 spurt made it 71-56 on Walton's inside basket with
6:23 to go.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona never trailed after scoring the last seven of the first
half.
</P>
<P>
   Ryan Mendez's 3-pointer, Stanford's seventh 3 of the game, put
the Cardinal up 37-32 with 2:05 left in the half. Gardner, a blur
of activity on offense and defense all night, started Arizona's
late first-half run with a layup, then drew an offensive foul
against Stanford's Michael McDonald.
</P>
<P>
   Jefferson sank two free throws to cut Stanford's lead to 37-36
with 1:11 to go and Gardner's 3-pointer put the Wildcats ahead
39-37 with 38 seconds to play until halftime.
</P>
<P>
   Jacobsen scored eight points, including consecutive 3-pointers,
in a 10-0 outburst that put Stanford ahead 19-10, but Arizona
rallied with a 10-2 spurt, catching the Cardinal at 26-26 on Luke
Walton's layup with 7:38 left in the half.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona, which may have blown a No. 1 seed with losses last week
at Oregon State and Oregon, hasn't lost three regular-season games
in a row since 1981-82, coach Lute Olson's first season with the
Wildcats.
</P>
<P>
   Stanford had 18 turnovers to Arizona's eight.
</P>
<P>
   The Wildcats shot 51 percent from the field against a team that
had ranked first nationally in field-goal defense at 38 percent.

after investigators determined the injuries were caused by a rare
genetic illness.
</P>
<P>
   Samuel and Elizabeth Glick will not be charged in the December
death of their 4-month-old daughter, Sarah.
</P>
<P>
   The girl had large bruises, and the autopsy showed brain and
retinal hemorrhaging, classic signs of shaken-baby syndrome. The
coroner quickly ruled the death a homicide.
</P>
<P>
   But several other doctors soon stepped in to say Sarah's
injuries were caused by a genetic liver disorder and vitamin K
deficiency.
</P>
<P>
   The Glicks were never charged, but their seven other children
were put in foster care until Feb. 17 while state police
investigated.
</P>
<P>
   ''The experts have concluded that although this child had the
appearance of a child that had been abused, that she had 15 areas
of bruising on her body and inter-cranial and retinal hemorrhages,
none of these conditions were the result of physical abuse,''
Northumberland County District Attorney Tony Rosini said Thursday
in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Rosini defended the investigation, saying the case was
complicated because Sarah's rare bleeding disorder wasn't readily
apparent.
</P>
<P>
   The Glicks are dairy farmers in Dornsife, about 100 miles west
of Philadelphia. Sarah had been vomiting for several days when her
parents found her unconscious Dec. 21. She died in a hospital two
days later.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Holmes Morton, an expert on Amish genetic disorders who
reviewed the case for the Glicks, was the first to say Sarah's
death was not abuse.
</P>
<P>
   Morton said babies often used to end up in the hospital with
brain hemorrhaging because of vitamin K deficiencies. Today's
babies get vitamin K in shots and supplements in their baby
formula. Because a midwife delivered Sarah and her mother
breast-fed, she got neither. Her blood did not clot properly.
</P>
<P>
   Compounding the problem was a genetic defect in her liver,
Morton said. Even if Sarah had been getting the vitamin, her body
would not have been able to break it down.
</P>
<P>
   After the prosecutors' decision was announced, the Glicks'
attorney, Chuck Hehmeyer, criticized investigators for not
admitting they had made a mistake. ''This family was seriously
damaged by this,'' Hehmeyer said.
</P>
<P>
   The Glicks were more understated.
</P>
<P>
   ''We were happy to hear,'' Samuel Glick said, shoveling manure
outside his barn as cows grunted inside their stalls.
</P>
<P>
   ''We think it should have been sooner,'' Elizabeth Glick added.

<HEADLINE> Nev. Driver Said Asleep at the Wheel  </HEADLINE>
By ANGIE WAGNER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS (AP) -- The accident that killed eight people and
injured five when their van tumbled off an interstate highway was
caused by a sleepy driver, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   The Clark County coroner's office said three men and five women,
ages 41 to 67, were killed in the crash Wednesday. The survivors,
including the van's driver, all were in fair condition Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Alcohol did not contribute to the crash on Interstate 15 in
Jean, about 30 miles south of Las Vegas, Cooke said. Weather and
speed also were not factors.
</P>
<P>
   ''Basically, the driver just fell asleep,'' Nevada Highway
Patrol Trooper Michael Cooke said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The driver veered off the left side of the interstate, then
overcorrected, the Highway Patrol said. The van hit a guardrail and
barreled into a steep gravel median, flipping several times.
</P>
<P>
   Bodies and personal belongings -- a purse, some shoes, a suitcase
-- were strewn across the median between two roadside casinos.
</P>
<P>
   The group's green Dodge van was rented Tuesday in Glendale,
Calif., by the driver, Yury Shkolnikov, 63. Cooke said the group
was traveling to Las Vegas, but the relationship between them was
unclear. Some members of the group apparently were married.
</P>
<P>
   Six of the eight killed were identified: Leya Romanovsky, 53, of
Chatsworth, Calif.; Vitaly Rabinovich, 60, and Mariya Vilnar, 52,
of Brookline, Mass.; Alla Rabovsky, 41, of Latham, N.Y.; Marat
Kutikov, 67, of Albany, N.Y.; and Sonya Elkin, 62, of Kingston, Pa.

<HEADLINE> Nev. Horse Shooting Charges Tossed  </HEADLINE>
By SANDRA CHEREB, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   VIRGINIA CITY, Nev. (AP) -- The case against three men charged in
the mass killing of wild horses east of Reno hinges on whether
prosecutors can prove they shot and killed one single horse.
</P>
<P>
   Anthony Merlino, 21, and two former Marines, Darien Brock, 21,
and Scott Brendle, 22, were accused of shooting 34 horses in
December 1998. They admitted they shot at one horse, but denied any
other involvement.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, District Judge Michael Griffin ruled the former
high school buddies from Reno can be tried in the death of only one
animal. The misdemeanor of maiming or killing another person's
animal carries a maximum penalty of up to one year in jail and a
$2,000 fine.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Freeman, a lawyer for Merlino, said the men arrived on the
scene after most of the horses were already dead.
</P>
<P>
   The judge said there was no ballistics evidence to link any of
the men's guns to the shell casings found at the scene. He said
their own admissions were the only thing that linked them to the
case at all.
</P>
<P>
   ''Without the admission of the defendants you have no case,''
Griffin told the prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutor Sharon Claassen said her office will decide within a
week whether to appeal the ruling.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities discovered the dead horses in a canyon just east of
Reno, within a mile of Interstate 80. Some wounded horses wandered
for days before authorities chased them down and destroyed them.
</P>
<P>
   The shootings outraged animal activists across the country; the
two Marines were given the equivalent of a dishonorable discharge.

<HEADLINE> Hurricane-flooded Cars Often Resold  </HEADLINE>
By RANDALL CHASE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) -- Some of the estimated 75,000 cars flooded
by Hurricane Floyd are being resold by people who aren't disclosing
the damage, according to a AAA motor club official.
</P>
<P>
   Most states, including North Carolina, require auto dealers to
disclose whether a car has been damaged by flooding, said Kerry
Powell, a spokesman for the North Carolina Automobile Dealers
Association.
</P>
<P>
   The North Carolina attorney general's office has received about
10 complaints over the past few weeks from people who believe
unscrupulous sellers sold them flood-damaged vehicles without
telling them.
</P>
<P>
   Spokeswoman Cari Hepp said three of the vehicles have been
confirmed as flooded cars, and the new owners received restitution.
</P>
<P>
   ''Sometimes, these go through two or three wholesale auctions to
sort of muddy the title,'' said Tom Crosby, a spokesman for AAA
Carolinas Motor Club. ''You may not know it's a flood-damaged
vehicle.''
</P>
<P>
   Crosby said the motor club based its estimate of 75,000
flood-damaged vehicles on information supplied by car dealers and
insurance companies. About a third of the damaged vehicles are
believed to be in circulation, with the rest either junked or used
for parts, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Hurricane Floyd, North Carolina's worst natural disaster,
drenched the area in 20 inches of rain in September and was blamed
for at least 51 deaths. Floodwaters destroyed or damaged tens of
thousands of homes and vehicles. The damage was put at more than $6
billion.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the damaged cars are being taken to South America for
resale, said Robert Glaser, vice president of the North Carolina
Automobile Dealers Association.

<HEADLINE> N.C. Bomber Gets 40 years in Prison  </HEADLINE>
By PAUL NOWELL, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WINSTON-SALEM, N.C. (AP) -- An electronics repairman who
detonated bombs at two Lowe's Home Improvement Stores and tried to
extort $250,000 from the chain has been sentenced to more than 40
years in prison.
</P>
<P>
   George Matos Rocha, 51, pleaded guilty in December to explosives
charges and extortion. He could have faced life in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Two bombs exploded minutes apart Sept. 22 at Lowe's stores in
Asheboro and Salisbury. One person was injured. Six days later, a
third, unexploded bomb was found at a store in Concord.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors said Rocha was seeking revenge for a 1998 arrest for
switching labels on merchandise at a Greensboro Lowe's store in an
effort to get the goods for less money.
</P>
<P>
   Before U.S. District Judge James Beatty imposed the sentence and
ordered Rocha to pay $2 million restitution, Rocha read a statement
expressing remorse.
</P>
<P>
   ''I apologize to everybody I hurt,'' he said Thursday. ''It was
not supposed to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   He avoided eye contact with Mary Priscilla Clay, 48, who had
testified that she was buying paint and stain at the Asheboro store
when the bomb went off, partially deafening her and setting her
clothes ablaze.
</P>
<P>
   Lowe's eventually met Rocha's demand to send $250,000 to an
account he had opened in Latvia. Agents traced transactions
conducted with the bank over the Internet to Rocha's home
telephone.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Delivers Aid in Mozambique  </HEADLINE>
By ANDREW SELSKY, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIRA, Mozambique (AP) -- Rain paralyzed aid deliveries to
hundreds of thousands of flood victims in southern Mozambique while
the U.S. military delivered thousands of pounds of rice to hungry
people in ravaged central regions.
</P>
<P>
   More rain was forecast for today, but military helicopter pilots
from Spain, Britain and other countries planned to try once again
to deliver food, medical supplies and other aid to the flooded
Limpopo River valley.
</P>
<P>
   U.N. World Food Program spokeswoman Lindsey Davis said food
stored in aid camps would run out in a day or two unless the flood
victims received new supplies.
</P>
<P>
   Maj. Gen. Joseph Wehrle, the commander of a 700-member U.S.
military force, arrived Thursday in the steamy port city of Beira,
Mozambique's second-largest city, aboard a C-130 plane. Minutes
later, three Blackhawk helicopters and a refueling plane swooped
in.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're excited to be here,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Some troops from other countries, however, who have been
rescuing flood victims for days and even weeks, were unimpressed by
the Americans' arrival. ''The Hollywood show is here,'' one German
military pilot muttered.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. military's relief mission had stalled Wednesday in
South Africa as commanders waited for a go-ahead from aid agencies
over when and where to deliver aid. Air Force Col. Steve Eddy, head
of air operations for the U.S. mission, said lingering problems
were resolved in meetings with agency representatives late
Wednesday and early Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Several U.S. airmen said they understood why their late-arriving
mission might be criticized.
</P>
<P>
   ''I understand where they're coming from,'' said Staff Sgt. T.P.
Smith, of Pomeroy, Ohio. ''They've been busting their rears. But
it's the luck of the draw.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith said his 41st Rescue Squadron headed for Mozambique as
soon as it got its orders, postponing its return home to Moody Air
Force Base, Ga., after serving two months in Turkey on standby to
retrieve any downed U.S. airmen enforcing the no-fly zone over
Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   ''When we saw the images on CNN of the flooding in Mozambique,
we suspected we might be diverted here,'' said Capt. Ray Smith, of
Covington, Ky.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after the Americans arrived in Beira, Mozambican Prime
Minister Pascoal Mocumbi flew in and reassured the helicopter crews
that they had indeed arrived in time.
</P>
<P>
   ''We need aircraft because there are still lives to be saved,''
Mocumbi said. ''If there is one life to be saved, you're never
late.''
</P>
<P>
   The three Blackhawks then flew loads of rice to villages along
the hard-hit Save River valley, where the sun was shining.
</P>
<P>
   ''There was massive destruction -- water still up to the
rooftops, trees down, dead animals in the water,'' the WFP's Abby
Spring said.
</P>
<P>
   Up to a million Mozambicans lost their homes or their livelihood
as the result of the floods. Aid agency officials expect the death
toll to soar into the thousands.
</P>
<P>
   But while the weather was generally fine in central regions,
there were downpours in the south Thursday that recalled the weeks
of rains that led to the flooding.
</P>
<P>
   Continued rain was a nightmare outside Mozambique as well. Aid
agencies Thursday rushed food, medicine and blankets to more than
700,000 flood victims in the nearby Indian Ocean island of
Madagascar. Flooding in recent weeks has killed 130 people.
</P>
<P>
   Mocumbi said he took pride that during the most critical phase
of Mozambique's flooding nearby African states bore the bulk of the
aid operation.
</P>
<P>
   South African helicopters plucked more than 12,000 Mozambicans
to safety from the floodwaters. Neighboring Malawi, which like
Mozambique is one of the poorest countries in the world, sent two
helicopters. The tiny kingdom of Lesotho, also poor, flew in aid
supplies.
</P>
<P>
   ''It gives me more than hope, but a certainty that once we come
together for common objectives we can overcome all obstacles,''
Mocumbi said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, there was confusion over unconfirmed reports that
20,000 people, thought to be previously undetected flood victims,
had been seen on the move north of the capital, Maputo.
</P>
<P>
   ''The number and the location of these people cannot be
confirmed,'' said Foreign Minister Leonardo Simao.
</P>
<P>
   A U.N. plane took off from Maputo twice Thursday to search for
the reported refugees, but both times it had to turn back due to
the rainy weather, said U.N. spokeswoman Rosa Malango.

<HEADLINE> Marino Yet To Make Decision  </HEADLINE>
By STEVEN WINE, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- Dan Marino has yet to make up his mind concerning
retirement, his agent said Thursday following several reports that
the future Hall of Famer plans to call it quits next week.
</P>
<P>
   Marvin Demoff, Marino's agent, told ESPN.com that Marino had yet
to decide whether he would retire or stay in football, perhaps by
accepting an offer from the Minnesota Vikings.
</P>
<P>
   The Miami Herald, CNN-SI and two Miami TV stations reported that
Marino had decided to reject the Vikings' offer and retire instead.
The Herald quoted two sources close to Marino as saying that the
most prolific passer in NFL history told friends Thursday night
he'll retire after 17 seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Dolphins president Eddie Jones said the reports were news to
him.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have not heard a thing about it,'' Jones said. ''It's Dan's
decision to make. If he has made it, I have no idea.''
</P>
<P>
   The Vikings wanted Marino to replace Jeff George as their
starting quarterback. Marino earlier decided against remaining with
the Miami Dolphins after concluding that new coach Dave Wannstedt
didn't want him back.
</P>
<P>
   Marino, 38, would follow Miami coach Jimmy Johnson into
retirement. They clashed frequently during the Dolphins'
disappointing 1999 season, and Johnson publicly criticized Marino
for poor decisions and costly turnovers.
</P>
<P>
   Their final bid to win a Super Bowl together ended with a 62-7
playoff loss at Jacksonville, the most lopsided defeat in franchise
history. Johnson retired the next day.
</P>
<P>
   Marino voided his contract in February and became a free agent.
When the Dolphins signed free agent quarterback Jay Fiedler to a
three-year, $3.8 million contract, it was clear Marino had likely
played his last game in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   Friends said Marino was angry about the way the Dolphins treated
him in recent weeks, but he declined to complain publicly.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've been a Dolphin for 17 years, and I'll be a Dolphin for
the rest of my life,'' he said in February. ''That will never
change.''
</P>
<P>
   Marino is the most prolific passer in NFL history. In 17 seasons
he has completed 4,967 passes for 61,361 yards and 420 touchdowns,
all NFL records. In 1984, his second season, Marino threw for 5,084
yards and 48 touchdowns, league records that still stand.

<HEADLINE> Germans Find Happiness Without Autos  </HEADLINE>
By PAUL GEITNER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   FREIBURG, Germany (AP) -- Lunchtime at the Vauban kindergarten,
and parents start pulling up to pick up their children. But there's
no convoy of minivans or station wagons, not even a parking lot.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a bitter cold wind, these moms and dads roll to the door
on bicycles, helmets on their heads and pant legs wrapped with
reflective bands. Not because their cars are in the shop, but
because they're not welcome in the neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   The Vauban development -- 280 new homes so far on a former
military base -- is Germany's biggest experiment in ''auto-free
living.'' Once dismissed as an ''eco-freak'' fantasy, the concept
is moving off the drawing board and winning real world converts,
even in the land of high-speed autobahns and the Volkswagen
''people's car.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I simply like it better,'' says Ruthild Haage-Rapp as she
bundles two fidgeting 2-year-olds, Simon and Maria, into their
seats in a green-and-pink trailer attached to her dusty bicycle.
</P>
<P>
   ''The children can play in the street,'' she says. ''It's quiet.
You can stand by your kitchen window without all the noise from the
street. Then the inconvenience is worth it.''
</P>
<P>
   Such sentiments seem to be striking a chord across western
Europe as centuries-old cities with their narrow, cobblestone
streets become more and more congested.
</P>
<P>
   During France's voluntary ''day without cars'' last September,
even government ministers rode bikes or electric scooters to a
Cabinet meeting. Italian cities, including eternally congested
Rome, have promoted carless days to cut pollution and promote
public transportation.
</P>
<P>
   Cities big and small across the continent also have introduced
permanent pedestrian zones in their central business districts.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's just like nonsmokers seeking smoke-free space,'' says
German lawmaker Franziska Eichstaedt-Bohlig, a Green party housing
expert. ''People are looking for places where they're not
constantly being confronted with cars.''
</P>
<P>
   Amsterdam finished the continent's first big auto-free
development, with 600 apartments, in 1998. The first Viennese moved
into a similar project in the Austrian capital in December, and
another should be completed in Edinburgh, Scotland, this summer.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think Europeans are as much in the grip of 'I am my
car,' which is kind of a U.S. phenomenon,'' says J.H. Crawford, an
American author based in Amsterdam and publisher of the Car-Free
Times Internet newsletter.
</P>
<P>
   Reasons include high gas prices, better public transportation
and simple geography -- European cities are ''closer together and
denser.''
</P>
<P>
   But beyond that, Crawford says, ''people here are pretty well
convinced that we've kind of reached the limits of automobile
traffic -- and gone beyond perhaps -- and would really like to have
less of it than more.''
</P>
<P>
   Germany looks to be furthest along, with about 20 projects in
various stages of development. Such projects face special hurdles
because of building codes stemming from Nazi policies that required
developers to provide a parking space for each new living unit
built.
</P>
<P>
   Vauban solved the problem by building a garage outside the
auto-free areas of the development, which covers 94 acres in all.
Those who want a parking space pay about $18,000, or about 10
percent of the average cost of an 1,100-square-foot apartment.
</P>
<P>
   Car-free households aren't completely off the hook: They have to
contribute $3,500 to a fund that holds a plot of land in trust in
case more parking is needed someday. If they later buy a car, the
payment will be applied toward a garage space.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our goal was not to be so dogmatic -- making people promise
till the end of their lives never to get a car,'' says Claudia
Nobis, who oversees traffic issues at Vauban. ''But whoever doesn't
have a car gets a big financial break.''
</P>
<P>
   About half the 280 households in Vauban's auto-free district
have so far opted to go car-free. Private cars are allowed through
for pickups and deliveries, but can't stay. Anyone who violates the
parking rules can be ticketed by the city. But the biggest hazards
seem to be the jumbles of bicycles outside almost every front door.
</P>
<P>
   Monika Frowis, who lives in the development with her husband and
two small children, admits it was an ''adjustment'' after they got
rid of their car four months ago.
</P>
<P>
   But as she buckled her 3{ year old son, Manuel, into the child
seat on the back of her bike, she said she has learned to get
around with a combination of pedal power, car-sharing, the train
and taxis.
</P>
<P>
   Besides helping the environment, there are other advantages, she
says.
</P>
<P>
   ''One plans a little more, and you don't take on so much,'' she
says. ''You do less running around, which is nice.''
</P>
<P>
   Haage-Rapp's family isn't ready to make the leap yet. With three
kids -- ages 2, 7 and 10 -- they're hanging on to their minivan for
now.
</P>
<P>
   ''But we'll probably use it less,'' she says. ''If you have to
walk 300 meters (yards) to the garage to get it, it makes you stop
and think.''

<HEADLINE> Navy Bean Seed Pulled After Problem  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN MacDONALD, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   FARGO, N.D. (AP) -- North Dakota State University is halting
production and distribution of a newly released variety of navy
bean seed after plantings showed potentially serious problems that
could make the beans mushy.
</P>
<P>
   It is the first time researchers are aware of that the school
had to pull a seed variety for problems detected only after its
release.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's unfortunate, but necessary,'' Ken Grafton, a seed breeder
at the university's Agricultural Experiment Station in Fargo, said
Thursday. ''Even though this is somewhat embarrassing to us, for
the betterment of farmers and the industry, we decided we needed to
stop distribution and pull the seed.''
</P>
<P>
   Called Commander, the navy bean variety was the result of more
than nine years of research, said Al Schneiter, chairman of the
university's plant sciences department.
</P>
<P>
   It was released in January for ''seed increase,'' where it is
used only to grow additional seed for eventual sale. Officials had
hoped to make it available to farmers to plant as early as next
year.
</P>
<P>
   But Grafton said samples of Commander seed grown in test plots
in Washington state last summer had ''significantly high
proportions'' of an imperfection that could drastically reduce
quality. The problem was detected only recently when samples were
returned for examination.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the beans that were produced, Grafton said, had outer
coatings that were not intact, allowing moisture to get inside the
beans.
</P>
<P>
   ''Rather than staying intact when it's cooked, for instance, the
bean turns into mush,'' Schneiter said. ''So rather than having a
whole bean in your pork and beans, you'd have mush, and that's not
a desirable quality.''
</P>
<P>
   Grafton said the problem is caused by ''environmental stress,''
but the specific culprit is still not known.
</P>
<P>
   The problem, however, never turned up in test plots grown in
North Dakota or at the experiment station's off-season nursery in
Puerto Rico, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''If it had, we would never have released the variety,'' Grafton
said.
</P>
<P>
   Schneiter said the decision to pull the seed was made to protect
farmers and to protect the reputation of seed breeders in the Upper
Midwest, whose track record for quality seed is excellent.

   SIOUX FALLS, S.D. (AP) -- You can scarcely read a Norse myth
without finding Thor or one of the other gods or heroes sipping a
cup of mead between battles.
</P>
<P>
   But you may not have to go all the way to Valhalla for the
ancient beverage if some South Dakota honey producers have their
way.
</P>
<P>
   They are looking at the mead market as one possible use for
their product, said Glen Wollman, secretary-treasurer of the
Mid-U.S. Honey Producers Marketing Association.
</P>
<P>
   Wine and vinegar are among the other options, but Wollman, of
Parker, says mead has most of the group's attention.
</P>
<P>
   ''Mead looks like the primary one right now,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Mead has been popular in northern Europe for centuries, in part
because grapes for wine production were harder to come by.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was natural to take honey, add water and yeast and let it
ferment,'' said Pierce, Neb., winemaker Ed Swanson, who also makes
mead.
</P>
<P>
   Wollman said his group includes honey producers from the
Dakotas, Iowa, Wyoming, Montana, Kansas, Nebraska and Minnesota.

<HEADLINE> Billy Joel presses for relief for lobstermen  </HEADLINE>
By SHANNON McCAFFREY, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Billy Joel has added the title amateur
lobbyist to his resume.
</P>
<P>
   The Piano Man traveled to Capitol Hill on Thursday to press
Congress for federal aid for Long Island Sound's struggling
lobstermen.
</P>
<P>
   Lobsters are dying off mysteriously in the Sound, threatening to
wipe out the industry there. Scientists believe a parasite is to
blame but the exact cause of the massive die-off is still unclear.
</P>
<P>
   Joel, a native of Long Island, has crusaded on behalf of the
island's fishermen for years. His song ''Downeaster Alexa''
portrays the plight of Eastern Long Island fishermen. Joel said
Thursday the disappearance of the lobstermen, a specialty which is
often a last resort for fishermen, would change the fabric of Long
Island.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't want to see them disappear,'' Joel said. ''People
should come to Long Island not just because it sells postcards and
T-shirts but because it sells lobsters.''
</P>
<P>
   The singer and songwriter recently sold his home in the Hamptons
to comedian Jerry Seinfeld for a whopping $40 million and is moving
to Long Island's North Shore, which overlooks the Sound.
</P>
<P>
   Joel appeared at a Washington news conference with Sen. Charles
Schumer, D-N.Y., and several members of the Long Island
congressional delegation. Democratic Rep. Michael Forbes and
Republican Rep. Rick Lazio, both of Long Island, attended the news
conference along with Democratic Reps. Gary Ackerman, of Queens,
and Nita Lowey, of Westchester.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration named the Sound a Commercial Fishery
Disaster area in January and the president has called for $10
million in aid.
</P>
<P>
   But lawmakers from Connecticut and New York say that isn't
enough. They are pushing for $30 million in federal money for
research into why the lobsters are dying and to help lobstermen
reeling from the loss of their livelihood.
</P>
<P>
   Schumer said Congress has been quick to help farmers hurt by
droughts and other disasters and should come do the same for
lobstermen.
</P>
<P>
   ''If we don't find the cause of this real soon, a 200-year-old
way of life will end,'' Schumer said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, 20 Democratic and Republican state lawmakers from
Long Island also called on Congress to provide relief.
</P>
<P>
   The lobster blight ''has dealt a severe economic blow to the
working men and women of our community who make their living
harvesting and selling lobsters,'' the legislators said, calling
for direct grants to the hardest hit lobstermen.
</P>
<P>
   Long Island Sound is the No. 3 lobster market in the nation,
behind Maine and Massachusetts. New York brings in about 8.5
million pounds of lobster a year and Connecticut another 3.5
million pounds.

<HEADLINE> Kings 3, Rangers 1  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Jozef Stumpel, who nearly put the puck into
his own net, scored the tying and go-ahead goals as the Los Angeles
Kings beat the New York Rangers 3-1 Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings, who surrendered six first-period goals in an 8-3 loss
at Madison Square Garden in their only other meeting this season,
tied it at 1 with 2:24 left in the second period.
</P>
<P>
   Luc Robitaille, who set up the first two Los Angeles goals,
earned his 500th assist with the Kings.
</P>
<P>
   Stumpel scored the game-winner with 15:57 to play, beating Mike
Richter to the stick side from the left circle. Robitaille banged
the puck off the boards past Rangers defenseman Mathieu Schneider
at the blue line.
</P>
<P>
   It was Stumpel's 14th goal and his third game-winner in as many
contests. Stumpel scored in overtime Saturday night to beat
Nashville.
</P>
<P>
   Stumpel came within two feet of giving the Rangers a goal eight
minutes in. Kings goalie Jamie Storr headed to the bench on a
delayed-penalty call and Stumpel, mistaking a linesman at the New
York blue line for one of his teammates, sent the puck the length
of the ice -- wide of the left post.
</P>
<P>
   The eight-place Rangers squandered a chance to increase their
one-point edge over Pittsburgh and Montreal in the race for the
Eastern Conference playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   New York is trying to avoid missing the playoffs in three
consecutive seasons for the first time since a four-year drought
from 1963-66.
</P>
<P>
   Rookie Michael York scored his 22nd goal and seventh on the
power play to give the Rangers a 1-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Kings defenseman Jere Karalahti was sent off for hooking Petr
Nedved just 14 seconds before York scored 10:17 in. York got the
puck at the goal line from Theo Fleury and banked it in off the
inside of Storr's left leg.
</P>
<P>
   Bryan Smolinski scored into an empty-net with two seconds
remaining after Rangers defenseman Brian Leetch was dumped at the
Los Angeles blue line.
</P>
<P>
   New York forward John MacLean sat out his second straight game
after getting hit in the right eye by a puck Monday night.

<HEADLINE> FAA Targets Air Traffic Delays  </HEADLINE>
By DEB RIECHMANN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- To avoid a repeat of last year's long airplane
delays, the Clinton administration has come up with a plan it hopes
will ease gridlock when spring and summer thunderstorms snarl
traffic at the nation's airports.
</P>
<P>
   People in the industry say the plan aims to take a national, not
just a regional, approach to managing air traffic and rerouting
planes around storms. Traffic planners at the Federal Aviation
Administration's air traffic control system command center in
Herndon, Va., will be given more authority to make decisions to
keep traffic moving.
</P>
<P>
   Officials were to outline the new plan today.
</P>
<P>
   It's a strategy that takes on new urgency in light of a forecast
issued earlier this week that commercial airplanes flying in U.S.
airspace will carry more than 1 billion passengers a year by 2010.
That's up from 650 million last year.
</P>
<P>
   Pilots seeking clearance to take off last summer heard the words
''ground stop'' all too often. Taxiways were clogged. Idling planes
wasted fuel. Angry passengers missed flights.
</P>
<P>
   ''The standard ground stop during severe weather was two
hours,'' said Paul McCarthy, an airline pilot who often flies
between Boston and Washington. ''It was agony in the extreme. You'd
push back from the gate on time, taxi to a remote part of the
airport and set your parking brake. Passengers were packed in the
back and they started sweating.''
</P>
<P>
   Often, airport control towers didn't have timely information.
''Decisions were being made in a vacuum and we can't do that if
we're going to have an integrated national transportation system,''
said McCarthy, who declined to identify his employer during a
telephone interview.
</P>
<P>
   There were 197,531 air traffic control delays between April and
August last year, agency figures show. That was 36 percent higher
than the same five-month period in 1998. Delays in July 1999 alone
were up 76 percent over the year before.
</P>
<P>
   ''We had the worst summer last year in terms of delays. It's not
a good record for us,'' FAA Administrator Jane Garvey said. ''This
is not the silver bullet. We're taking, I think, some immediate,
short-term steps. Our long-range answer, clearly, is modernizing
the system. That's why getting the resources to see that through is
so important.''
</P>
<P>
   Garvey said representatives from the airlines, labor unions,
controllers and regulators have met every Tuesday since last fall
to find a way to deal with weather problems that were exacerbated
last year by computer problems at a few of the FAA's 20 control
centers.
</P>
<P>
   As a plane flies across the sky, air traffic controllers in
these centers transfer responsibility for the aircraft like a baton
in a relay race. But these controllers can't see the big picture
like FAA traffic planners in Herndon can -- they sit at giant
screens that show weather patterns and track all flights from
takeoff to landing.
</P>
<P>
   Duane Woerth, president of the Air Line Pilots Association, is
eager to see if the new plan will reduce delays, but he emphasized
that it is no substitute for the FAA's $13 billion project to
modernize the air traffic control system. And he said it will only
work if the airlines are disciplined enough not to clog taxiways by
letting planes leave gates out-of-turn.
</P>
<P>
   ''Everybody is going to have to play by the rules and not say
'Whoops, I guess I'm now blocking you, United (airplane), but I
really needed to clear that gate,''' Woerth said. ''The amount of
cooperation to make this plan work is going to be extraordinary.
Nobody should be looking for a delay-free summer.''
</P>
<P>
   The Air Transport Association, the airlines' trade group,
expects delays will be down this summer, but said the long-term
solution is a modernized system that can handle an expanding fleet
of planes.
</P>
<P>
   ''The FAA's system is broken,'' the group said in a report in
October. ''If it is not fixed, the resulting delays will virtually
eliminate the dependability of airline schedules and the system
will descend into gridlock.''

<HEADLINE> Vet To Return Sword to Japan  </HEADLINE>
By GREG SMITH, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WINFIELD, Iowa (AP) -- Albert Schmidt vividly remembers the day
when a courier delivered the 3-foot-long wooden box to his father's
butcher shop. Customers gasped at what was inside -- a gleaming
samurai sword, courtesy of the U.S. Army.
</P>
<P>
   Schmidt was caught off guard by the gift delivered in late 1945
or early 1946 and acquired by his comrades-in-arms.
</P>
<P>
   For the next half-century, the sword hung on his family room
wall -- a reminder, along with his Purple Heart medal, of his World
War II combat experience and a symbol of his feelings toward the
Japanese.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was a horrible time. I hated them at the time, naturally,
because of all the terrible things that happened,'' Schmidt says.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the sword has been taken down and replaced in its
original wooden box. Schmidt plans to return the sword to its
owners in Japan once paperwork hurdles have been cleared.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's very important to me,'' says Schmidt, now 83. ''At my
age, I thought I needed to get this done, to return it to its
rightful owners,'' he says. ''I'm thinking about the family.''
</P>
<P>
   Shuji Kikuchi, whose late father was the sword's original owner,
is grateful.
</P>
<P>
   ''To me it's a precious memento of my parents,'' Kikuchi said
this week from his home in Yamagata, north of Tokyo. ''It'll be our
family treasure.''
</P>
<P>
   Schmidt, the son of German immigrants and a fifth-generation
butcher, fought with the 11th Airborne Division against the
Japanese in the Philippines in 1945.
</P>
<P>
   That year, shrapnel in his brain caused aphasia, a condition
that affected his ability to use or comprehend words.
</P>
<P>
   After several months in the hospital, Schmidt overcame the
condition, and returned home to Winfield with his nightmares, his
Purple Heart and his ill will.
</P>
<P>
   The sword arrived a few months later. It was not immediately
clear how it had been acquired, though an accompanying letter said
it was a ''token remembrance from those of us in the Division who
now occupy the homeland of the Jap. It was captured in Northern
Honshu after the collapse and surrender.''
</P>
<P>
   It was signed by J.W. Swing, major general of the U.S. Army.
</P>
<P>
   Samurai swords, considered heirlooms, were mostly ceremonial,
worn by high-ranking officers and not intended for combat.
</P>
<P>
   Schmidt decided to return the sword after a chance meeting on a
golf course with two Iowa Wesleyan College students from Japan.
</P>
<P>
   He told them about the sword, which had a tag on its ornate
brass handle that identified, in Japanese, the owner. He went home,
got the sword and showed it to the students, who read him the name
and address.
</P>
<P>
   ''I went home later, looked at it and said, 'You have to get it
back to the family,''' Schmidt says.
</P>
<P>
   Schmidt, a 1937 graduate of Iowa Wesleyan, turned to the private
school of 785 students in nearby Mount Pleasant for help.
Eventually, he spoke with Fred Volkmann, another Wesleyan grad and
the vice chancellor for public affairs at Washington University in
St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   Volkmann turned to Aki Hiro Aoki, a former classmate and friend
who is an official in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Aoki contacted the Ministry of Welfare -- an extraordinary move
by someone in his position who normally wouldn't be bothered with
such a task, Volkmann says.
</P>
<P>
   He took the time, however, because of his father.
</P>
<P>
   ''Aki's father was an honorable member of Japanese traditional
society. He was a samurai sword appraiser,'' Volkmann says. ''That
is a position of great honor in Japanese society because you are
associated with the history and character of that sword.''
</P>
<P>
   The Ministry of Welfare traced the sword to the family of
Nobusuke Kikuchi and his wife, Chiu Kikuchi.
</P>
<P>
   Nobusuke Kikuchi, a military doctor and lieutenant colonel in
the Japanese Army, died in 1939 after becoming ill, Aoki says. The
tag on the sword carried Chiu Kikuchi's name because she offered it
to the government around 1942.
</P>
<P>
   ''I once heard from my mother that there was a sword that went
missing during the war, but I never thought we could find it
again,'' says Shuji Kikuchi, 70.
</P>
<P>
   He says his father opposed use of the sword as a weapon and
never used it because he was not sent to the front line.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm proud of my father, and what he says makes the sword even
more special,'' he says. ''Once the sword comes back, I will never
let it leave this house.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Schmidt, he says some veterans don't want him to send the
sword back to Japan.
</P>
<P>
   ''They don't think they deserve to have it back,'' he says.
''But it's been over 50 years. People should put hatred aside.''

<HEADLINE> Chinese Pledge To Fight Corruption  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN LEICESTER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING (AP) -- China's top law enforcers pledged fresh efforts
today to battle corruption, telling the legislature that
lawbreakers will be severely punished ''no matter who they are.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Xiao Yang, China's top judge, and Han Zhubin, the top
prosecutor, cited Wednesday's execution of a corrupt deputy
provincial governor in telling legislators of their resolve to step
up efforts against graft, bribery and embezzlement.
</P>
<P>
   Xiao announced a two-year initiative to clean up and improve
county-level courts, and Han pledged a thorough investigation of
government officials implicated in major smuggling scandals.
</P>
<P>
   Battling pervasive corruption is a major theme of the 11-day
annual session of the National People's Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting opened Sunday with an acknowledgment from Premier
Zhu Rongji that anti-corruption efforts have fallen far short of
public expectations.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, authorities executed Hu Changqing, a deputy
provincial governor, for bribery in a case cited as a proof of the
government's resolve to punish wrongdoers, no matter how powerful.
</P>
<P>
   Taken together, Han and Xiao's reports showed the challenges
faced by the government in tackling the rising crime that has
accompanied communist China's shift toward market economics.
</P>
<P>
   Xiao, president of the Supreme People's Court, said courts tried
more than 539,000 criminal cases in 1999, up 12.3 percent over
1998, and that more than 600,000 criminals were sentenced, an
increase of 14 percent.
</P>
<P>
   He called for a crackdown on computer crime and continued
battles against prostitution, tax evasion, fraud, smuggling and
other crimes that have become widespread in the last two decades of
economic reform.
</P>
<P>
   Both officials reserved some of their strongest language for the
fight against graft.
</P>
<P>
   ''Those people who dare disregard the law and commit crimes must
be punished mercilessly without exception, no matter who they
are,'' Xiao said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Cases must all be investigated to the end, no matter what
organization or which people are involved. We must not be
soft-handed,'' Han added.
</P>
<P>
   He also called for the punishment of bribe-offerers who ''rope
state workers into corruption.''
</P>
<P>
   Xiao said 15,748 people were sentenced for graft, bribery and
embezzling public funds in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   He also promised severe punishment for separatists and criminals
who endanger state security -- words often used to describe
political dissidents.
</P>
<P>
   Xiao indicated that the government's battle against the banned
Falun Gong spiritual movement would continue, saying that people
who organize and use cults to commit crimes would be strictly
punished.
</P>
<P>
   Han, head of the Supreme People's Procuratorate, said China's
four-year-old ''Strike Hard'' anti-crime campaign, which has seen
more liberal use of the death penalty, also would continue.
</P>
<P>
   On a separate issue, Xiao called for efforts to prepare judges
for China's entry into the World Trade Organization. China is
nearing the end of a 14-year effort to join the world's top
rule-making body for international trade.
</P>
<P>
   Judges must be taught about international trade, intellectual
property rights and maritime issues and ''a group of judges who are
politically strong, upstanding, who understand the law, economics
and foreign languages must be trained as soon as possible,'' he
said.

<HEADLINE> Vietnamese Town Marks Anniversary  </HEADLINE>
By PAUL ALEXANDER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUON MA THUOT, Vietnam (AP) -- Goose-stepping troops marched in
rhythm to thundering patriotic music today as Vietnam celebrated a
surprise communist victory 25 years ago that proved to be a turning
point in the war against U.S.-backed forces.
</P>
<P>
   The capture of Buon Ma Thuot on March 10, 1975, set the stage
for a series of rapid-fire advances that led to the fall of the
South Vietnamese capital Saigon just over seven weeks later. That
ended the Vietnam War -- known here as ''The American War'' -- and
reunified the divided country.
</P>
<P>
   With a level of pomp rarely seen in such a reserved country, the
parade began at dawn today, 25 trained elephants pulling
camouflaged artillery guns past a massive victory monument
featuring an old Soviet tank.
</P>
<P>
   From a reviewing stand seating 1,000 invited guests, a
larger-than-life statue of Ho Chi Minh -- the father of communist
Vietnam -- cast a watchful gaze over dozens of floats and the
parade's 5,000 participants, including flag-waving youth groups,
women in flowing silk tunics and representatives of 43 ethnic
minorities in traditional dress.
</P>
<P>
   The victory at Buon Ma Thuot is ''a glorious golden page'' in
the country's history,'' Nguyen An Vinh, the provincial Communist
Party chief, said in a speech before the nationally televised
parade.
</P>
<P>
   ''In a short period of time, we smashed and eliminated all of
the enemy's war machines in this large battlefield, ushering in a
domino effect and the miserable fall of the puppet regime in South
Vietnam,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Jay Scarborough, then 28, has vivid memories of the fall of Buon
Ma Thuot. After a six-year stint teaching English and training
teachers, he was on what was supposed to be a two-month break from
law school on a Ford Foundation grant to photograph documents in
the Cham language.
</P>
<P>
   He arrived in Buon Ma Thuot, the capital of Daklak province, on
March 9 for a short break in the cool central highlands.
</P>
<P>
   His only real exposure to the war came in what he called a
''small mortar attack,'' but he figured out pretty quickly that
Buon Ma Thuot might not be such a good place to take a break.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Air Vietnam office was mobbed,'' Scarborough said in a
telephone interview from Albany, New York, where he is now an
attorney. ''At 6 p.m., the provincial chief said no more gasoline
was to be sold. Then we heard that the Viet Cong were only two
kilometers (1.2 miles) away. At 3 a.m., they began to shell the
city.''
</P>
<P>
   The attack lasted four hours. The technical school compound was
adjacent to the South Vietnamese army's 23rd Division, a major
target. There was no protection except the roof of the two-story
wooden school.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have never been so scared in my life,'' Scarborough said.
</P>
<P>
   He ended up being taken with a dozen people -- mostly
missionaries -- as prisoners of war. They spent six months in a POW
camp for South Vietnamese forces, then two months near Hanoi.
</P>
<P>
   ''We weren't mistreated,'' he said. ''They didn't know what to
do with us. We were just all concerned about our health. A lot of
people got malaria and gastrointestinal problems.
</P>
<P>
   ''We listened to the Radio Hanoi radio reports, and it seemed
that some place was falling day by day. It could have dragged on
for two years. That would have been hard.''

   Instead, it was over on April 30, although captivity dragged on
until late October when the group was released.

   ''My life has been pretty mundane since then,'' Scarborough
said.

<P>
   Despite the experience, Vietnam has gotten under his skin. He
has been back to Vietnam a dozen times and plans to keep returning.
</P>
<P>
   The large-scale festivities in Buon Ma Thuot show the importance
the government places on commemorations for a war that it claims it
wants to put into the past.
</P>
<P>
   But it remains clear that Vietnam, while not seeking a formal
apology from the United States or its allies, would welcome aid,
investment or reparations.
</P>
<P>
   Next week, William Cohen makes the first visit by a U.S. defense
secretary since the end of the war. Negotiations are also under way
with Washington on setting up joint research into the long-term
effects of toxic defoliants like Agent Orange that were sprayed to
eliminate cover for Viet Cong and North Vietnamese forces, and
which have been blamed for high rates of ailments among those who
were exposed and birth defects in their children.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly five years after relations were normalized, the two
countries also are trying to negotiate a trade agreement and other
pacts.

<HEADLINE> No. 22 Arizona 79, Stanford 72  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   STANFORD, Calif. (AP) -- Reshea Bristol and Monika Crank, held to
only a pair of baskets between them in the first 20 minutes, scored
13 each in the second half to lead No. 22 Arizona over Stanford
79-72 Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   The Wildcats (23-6, 12-5 Pac-10) moved into a tie with the
Cardinal for second place in the conference. Stanford (19-8, 12-5)
is trying for its 12th 20-win season in the last 13.
</P>
<P>
   Bristol and Crank each finished with 15 points for the Wildcats.
Angela Lackey added 14 points and eight rebounds, and Elizabeth
Pickney had 10 points and nine rebounds for Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   Jamie Carey, Carolyn Moos and Milena Flores each had 15 for
Stanford.
</P>
<P>
   Stanford took a 36-32 lead with 16:18 left with a layup by
Flores before the Wildcats went on a decisive 17-5 run.
</P>
<P>
   Crank scored eight of her points during that run, including a
pair of 3-pointers. Bristol capped the run with a pair of free
throws to give Arizona a 49-41 lead with 10:47 left.
</P>
<P>
   Bristol added six more points in the next three minutes, helping
to stretch the lead to 58-49 with 6:58 left.
</P>
<P>
   Stanford's late shoot-and-foul strategy didn't work, and the
Cardinal couldn't get closer than six in the last five minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona had a big advantage at the free-throw line, hitting
21-of-30 to Stanford's 10-of-14. The Wildcats dominated on the
board, outrebounding Stanford 40-25.

<HEADLINE> Nasdaq Cements Top-Performing Role  </HEADLINE>
By EILEEN GLANTON, AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- In the latest sign of investors' frenzy for
technology, the Nasdaq composite index vaulted past 5,000 slightly
more than two months after it first topped 4,000.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq's stunning gains this year, and its seemingly
unstoppable velocity, have confirmed the index as the
top-performing and fastest-growing barometer of the U.S. stock
market.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq Stock Market launched the composite index 29 years
ago as a way to measure the progress of fledgling companies too
small or weak for the prestigious New York Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, the index crossed 5,000 for the first time after
soaring 149.60 points Thursday to at 5,046.86.
</P>
<P>
   The index is now up 24 percent for the year, compared with a 13
percent loss for its blue-chip counterpart, the Dow Jones
industrial average. The Nasdaq's velocity is unmatched, as well; it
took the Dow nearly nine months to rise from 4,000 and 5,000 in
1995.
</P>
<P>
   While many Wall Street pros insist that round numbers like 5,000
hold no special significance, the Nasdaq's rapid growth has left
some slightly awestruck.
</P>
<P>
   ''The move up has been nothing short of scintillating,'' said
Hugh Johnson, chief investment officer at First Albany Corp.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq Stock Market began trading on Feb. 8, 1971. It was
the world's first electronic market, where traders posted their
prices on computer screens instead of haggling on a trading floor.
The new market's name, the National Association of Securities
Dealers Automated Quotation system, came from the self-regulatory
security industry group that created it.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq composite index was set up to measure all of the new
market's companies, which at the time numbered 2,500. Now about
5,000 companies trade on the Nasdaq.
</P>
<P>
   For years, most companies that grew large enough to meet the
NYSE's more stringent listing requirements moved there,
contributing to Nasdaq's longtime reputation as a second-tier
index.
</P>
<P>
   But in recent years, one-time upstarts like Microsoft and Intel
who grew into corporate mammoths chose to stay put, even as their
market capitalizations -- the total dollar value of their shares --
soared. Last year, those two technology bellwethers were added to
the Dow Jones industrial average -- the first two Nasdaq stocks to
join the prestigious list of 30 companies.
</P>
<P>
   The shining performance of the Nasdaq has provided the only real
light for investors this year. The market is constantly expanding
with new stocks that tap into investor obsession with anything
having to do with computers, telecommunications, biotechnology and,
of course, the Internet -- all of which have come symbolize the
''new economy.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, most other stocks have been stuck in a narrow range,
hemmed in by worries about inflation and rising interest rates.
Blue-chip stocks -- the manufacturers, transportation, financial and
other companies of the ''old economy'' -- have been especially
moribund.
</P>
<P>
   On the surface, the Nasdaq's leap from 4,000 to 5,000 looks much
like its jump from 3,000 to 4,000. The index crossed its latest
thousand-point milestone in 46 trading sessions, compared with 39
sessions between 3,000 and 4,000.
</P>
<P>
   Both advances came in narrow markets, with a relative handful of
stocks contributing most of the gains. And both advances featured
fierce volatility, indicating to most market watchers that
short-term traders were largely responsible for the Nasdaq's
growing dominance.
</P>
<P>
   But there are some significant differences.
</P>
<P>
   First off, the large-capitalization companies that led the
Nasdaq's push to 4,000 have cooled a bit. Instead, investors are
seeking out new opportunities in the semiconductor and
biotechnology sectors. Human Genome Sciences, which uses genetic
research to develop drugs, has more than doubled since the start of
the year and now trades over $177 a share.
</P>
<P>
   More fundamentally, investors have embraced technology stocks as
the companies most likely to succeed if the Federal Reserve
continues raising interest rates to cool the fast-growing economy
and prevent inflation. That's a dramatic change from last year,
when many investors feared that younger tech companies would be
crippled by higher interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is now a belief that technology stocks are immune to
swings in interest rates and the business cycle in general,''
Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   That's because technology carries the promise of helping all
types of companies improve productivity, analysts said. Also these
companies don't depend as much on borrowing from banks to develop
their businesses, relying more on investors and venture
capitalists.
</P>
<P>
   ''Productivity is key to improving real standards of living and
keeping inflation at bay,'' said James M. Griffin Jr., chief
investment strategist at Aeltus Investment Management in Hartford,
Conn.
</P>
<P>
   Yet despite the vast promise of technology, many investors
remain leery of the sector. With their lofty valuations and
sometimes scant earnings, the stocks are prone to wild swings and
aren't for every investor.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Fertman, a 33-year-old New Yorker, said that while he owns
technology stocks, he remains fearful of their valuations.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a bubble that's about to burst,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Professional investors are nervous, too.
</P>
<P>
   ''I own them all,'' said Johnson ''They have made the difference
in my portfolios' performance. So I'm very grateful for their
extraordinary performance, but I'm also scared stiff.''

<HEADLINE> Miller Offers Plastic-Bottled Brews  </HEADLINE>
By SKIP WOLLENBERG, AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Here's a new one for the Miller Lite's
advertising All-Stars to debate -- does beer taste better when it's
bottled in plastic or glass?
</P>
<P>
   Miller Brewing Co. says it's no contest -- they taste the same.
But the prospect seems ripe for debate from the retired sports
stars who in television ads endlessly debated whether Lite was less
filling or tasted great in the brand's heyday a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   The nation's second-biggest brewer will soon start selling its
flagship Lite, Miller Genuine Draft and Icehouse nationally in
16-ounce and 20-ounce plastic bottles as well as in the traditional
glass bottles and aluminum cans.
</P>
<P>
   Milwaukee-based Miller has been testing reaction to beer in
plastic bottles over the past 18 months in more than a dozen
markets and arenas ranging from Miami's Orange Bowl to the Oakland
Coliseum.
</P>
<P>
   While plastic is widely used for beverages like milk and soft
drinks, Miller would be the first U.S. brewer to use plastic
bottles on such a large scale.
</P>
<P>
   ''Plastic bottles represent one of the biggest breakthroughs in
the beer world in years and have met with an overwhelmingly
positive response,'' Miller's top marketing executive, Bob Mikulay,
said in a statement Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   But others say many beer drinkers recoil at the idea of beer in
plastic. Beer industry leader Anheuser-Busch Inc., tested but
rejected using plastic bottles last year.
</P>
<P>
   And even as recycling activists applauded Miller for undertaking
the program and committing to use recycled plastic in making new
bottles, they warned that it could cost local governments more to
collect and sort the beer bottles.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Bussen, a spokesman for the Miller, conceded that there
was ''natural skepticism'' by beer drinkers to the idea of a
plastic beer bottle but said Miller found in the test markets that
the wariness ''tends to melt away'' when they get a chance to hold
the bottle and taste the brew.
</P>
<P>
   He said beer in plastic stays cold longer than in aluminum cans
and as long as in glass bottles, it weighs much less than glass and
it is unbreakable.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, he said the beer tastes the same. ''Eighty-five
percent of the people we asked in a variety of markets said they
would buy it again,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bussen said Miller doesn't expect that plastic will replace
glass or aluminum containers, but will enable Miller to sell beer
in places like sports arenas, music halls or the beach where glass
or cans may not be permitted.
</P>
<P>
   ''We don't see this representing anytime in the near future more
than 2 percent of our volume,'' he said. ''But we think it is a
great niche opportunity for us to have the right package for the
right place at the right time.''
</P>
<P>
   The bottles are being produced for Miller by Continental PET
Technologies, and will each carry a label on the neck noting that
it is a ''new plastic bottle.''
</P>
<P>
   Marian Salzman, director of the Brand Futures Group, conducted a
consumer survey on plastic bottles last year.
</P>
<P>
   Salzman surveyed 2,380 people in 26 countries by e-mail last
October and found while many people thought plastic beer bottles
were a sensational idea, others were ''horrified of drinking beer
from plastic bottles.''
</P>
<P>
   She said those surveyed usually associated quality with glass,
and mass production with plastic. ''They thought plastic bottles
were cheesier,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Bussen said the plastic bottles Miller will be using are
actually more expensive to make than glass but the brewer hopes to
reduce the costs as more are produced. He expects prices for beer
in plastic will be competitive with beer sold in similar-sized
glass containers.
</P>
<P>
   Recycling activists applauded Miller, especially for its
commitment to help buy back used bottles.
</P>
<P>
   ''Turning old bottles into new bottles is a step forward, at a
time when recycling rates are steadily declining,'' said Pat
Franklin, executive director of the Container Recycling Institute
of Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   But they said the plan to use amber for the Miller Lite and
Icehouse containers would boost recycling costs for some cities
since they would have to be sorted and saved separately from other
clear or green containers. The Miller Genuine Draft bottle is
clear.
</P>
<P>
   Bussen said Miller is aware of the concerns and hopes it can
help jump-start the market for recycled amber-colored plastic.

<HEADLINE> Reagan speechwriter uses fiction in new anti-Hillary book  </HEADLINE>
By BETH J. HARPAZ, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- There's a scene in Peggy Noonan's new book,
''The Case Against Hillary Clinton,'' in which the first lady tells
her Hollywood supporters they should censor their programming in
the interests of helping children.
</P>
<P>
   Ted Turner interrupts the first lady to tell her off. Clinton
responds with a crack about Jane Fonda visiting the Vietnamese
while John McCain was being held prisoner and then ...
</P>
<P>
   And then the writer wakes up.
</P>
<P>
   ''Because it had all been a dream,'' writes Noonan, a columnist
for The Wall Street Journal and President Reagan's former
speechwriter.
</P>
<P>
   ''It didn't happen. I had fallen asleep and my mind made it up --
some antic little inner Edmund Morris took over my unconscious, and
guided my hungry imaginings,'' she adds, referring to Morris'
controversial biography of Reagan, ''Dutch,'' in which the author
inserted himself as a fictional character.
</P>
<P>
   The passage is one of several imagined portrayals of what
Clinton might say or think if, in Noonan's opinion, she had more
guts, or if she were to win the Senate race.
</P>
<P>
   The book (ReganBooks, $24, available March 22) is the latest in
a truckload of recent works about the first lady, including Gail
Sheehy's ''Hillary's Choice'' and Barbara Olson's ''Hell To Pay.''
Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Carl Bernstein is also working on
one.
</P>
<P>
   Noonan thinks the first lady has a good shot at beating her
Republican rival for the Senate, New York City Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani. And the author also believes Clinton will use the office
as a steppingstone for the presidency -- something Clinton has
repeatedly denied.
</P>
<P>
   If the first lady loses, Noonan believes she may run for Senate
from her native state of Illinois in 2004, or keep her chances for
a White House run up with a high public profile working for
children's groups and giving speeches.
</P>
<P>
   ''There came the moment when I realized: 'They're never going to
leave,''' Noonan writes. ''Other presidents and first ladies do
their work, leave their imprint, and make a graceful exit,
departing the stage and attempting to become, if they were not
already, wise, high-minded and fair. But the Clintons -- they'll
stay until the last footlight fizzles and pops, and then we'll have
to wrestle them to the floor of the stage.''
</P>
<P>
   Here's Noonan inside Clinton's head as the first lady savors her
victory in the Senate campaign: ''And now I've won, and I've beaten
more than Rudy. I've beaten Bill. He got it and blew it. Now I'll
show him how it's done.''
</P>
<P>
   Here's Noonan imagining the first lady trying to come up with a
slogan. ''Something like -- who called in with this, I forget --
'It's not where I'm from, but where I stand. It's not where I was
born, but what I wish to contribute.' No, 'It's not where I was
born, but what I believe.' I like that.''
</P>
<P>
   The real Hillary Clinton, just a month ago and presumably too
late for Noonan to have known about it in writing the book, has
actually started saying something pretty darn close: ''I may be new
to your neighborhood, but I'm not new to your concerns.''
</P>
<P>
   Noonan also notes that Clinton speaks publicly on a near-daily
basis now, ''yet there are very few press reports that contain
extended quotes of her remarks.'' Noonan attributes this to a
deliberate strategy on Clinton's part of saying ''nothing
interesting'' because she ''wants not to explain her stands but to
obscure them.'' Noonan says most stories about Clinton's campaign
concentrate on atmosphere rather than substance because reporters
''have to provide the narrative that makes up for the empty spot
created by what Hillary didn't say.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's spokesman Howard Wolfson hadn't seen the book and had
no comment Thursday. A call to Noonan's literary agent, Joni Evans,
was not immediately returned.
</P>
<P>
   Noonan is upfront about the goal of her book, which is not a
biography but a ''polemic -- an argument for a point of view, in
this case a perspective highly critical of Mrs. Clinton.''
</P>
<P>
   But she says she is not a ''Clinton hater.''
</P>
<P>
   ''There are things I like about Mrs. Clinton, her fortitude and
her resourcefulness being two. I wish her a long life with good
health, much friendship and many grandchildren. But I do not wish
to see her succeed in continuing Clintonism in our national life.''

<HEADLINE> Lakers 109, Warriors 92  </HEADLINE>
By ROB GLOSTER, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) -- The Los Angeles Lakers' 17th straight
victory was routine. The only drama was the team's internal duel
for high-scoring honors.
</P>
<P>
   Kobe Bryant scored 30 points and Shaquille O'Neal had 29 points
and 13 rebounds as the Lakers extended their winning streak
Thursday night with a 109-92 defeat of lowly Golden State.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers, who also had a separate 16-game winning streak
earlier this season, now are more than halfway toward their
NBA-record 33-game winning streak during the 1971-72 season. They
next face Sacramento on Sunday in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal, coming off a 61-point game Monday against the Los
Angeles Clippers, and Bryant matched each other basket for basket
at times as the Lakers gradually built their lead. O'Neal scored on
a power move, only to be one-upped by a leaping basket by Bryant.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Hughes had 41 points for the Warriors, who have lost four
straight.
</P>
<P>
   Leading by 10 points at halftime, the Lakers built their margin
to 21 points on Robert Horry's three-point play with 2:07 left in
the third period. Los Angeles led 86-73 entering the fourth
quarter, despite a 10-2 run by Golden State to end the third
period.
</P>
<P>
   The Warriors pulled within 11 points early in the fourth
quarter, but got no closer. A 10-point Lakers run that include
3-pointers by Rick Fox and Derek Fisher made it 101-79 with six
minutes remaining.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal had 21 points and Bryant had 19 as the Lakers took a
59-49 halftime lead. Hughes had 21 points for the Warriors in the
first half, three times as many as any of his teammates.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers were leading 40-37 with five minutes left in the
second period when they went on a 12-0 run that included four
points by O'Neal and left Warriors coach Garry St. Jean stomping
the floor in frustration.
</P>
<P>
   Fisher slightly strained his left ankle in the second quarter,
but returned after halftime. Golden State's Vonteego Cummings
stepped on Fisher's foot as Cummings drove down the lane.
</P>
<P>
Notes: The crowd of 20,136 was the largest in Golden State
history. ... Los Angeles got its season-high ninth straight road
win. ... The Lakers became the first team to clinch a playoff spot
Tuesday night when the Denver Nuggets lost at Indiana. ... The
Warriors are 2-13 this season against Pacific Division peers. ...
Golden State lost all three games on a homestand that ended
Thursday. ... Center Erick Dampier returned for the Warriors after
missing three games with inflammation in his left knee. He scored
two points in 21 minutes. ... Golden State missed 15 free throws,
going 22-for-37 at the foul line.

<HEADLINE> Sterilization Suit Dismissed  </HEADLINE>
By MIKE HOUSEHOLDER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT (AP) -- It bothers Fred Aslin that he has no biological
sons, but what upsets him even more is why.
</P>
<P>
   Aslin, who turns 74 today, said the state sterilized him against
his will when he was just 18.
</P>
<P>
   ''They said I was so retarded that my kids would be retarded if
we had any kids,'' Aslin said Thursday. ''I never signed the paper
and they never approached me with a hearing or anything.''
</P>
<P>
   He sued the state last year for violating his civil rights, but
an Ingham County Circuit Court judge dismissed the lawsuit last
week, saying the state's three-year statute of limitations had run
out.
</P>
<P>
   His attorney, Lisa McNiff, said he has no plans to appeal.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've spoken with Fred and we feel that it's fruitless to
appeal at this point,'' McNiff said. ''Our chances in the Court of
Appeals are not good.''
</P>
<P>
   Aslin was 10 years old and living with his four brothers and
four sisters when his father died at the height of the Depression.
The state took him and his siblings from their mother, arguing that
she was unable to care for them.
</P>
<P>
   They were then placed in the Lapeer State School, a mental
institution in Michigan. Aslin said he was sterilized in 1944
because school officials believed he was developmentally disabled.
He said some of his siblings also were sterilized.
</P>
<P>
   Aslin used the Freedom of Information Act to request his
records, which he said labeled him ''a feeble-minded moron'' while
also showing he received praise for his academic performance.
</P>
<P>
   Aslin said he was sterilized even though he refused to sign
papers authorizing the procedure.
</P>
<P>
   ''I said, 'No, I'm not going to sign that.' I didn't want to be
cut on. I don't want anyone cutting on me. I didn't realize at the
time that sterilization is what it is.''
</P>
<P>
   After a hearing Aslin says he was not allowed to attend, a
probate judge signed papers ordering the procedure.
</P>
<P>
   Aslin left Lapeer in 1948 and was drafted into the Army. He
served in the Korean War, was wounded and returned to marry a widow
and help raise her two infant children.
</P>
<P>
   Though Aslin has no legal recourse, he has received a formal
letter of apology from James K. Haveman Jr., the director of the
Michigan Department of Community Health.
</P>
<P>
   ''Looking back on it now, it is clear that the treatment you and
others received was offensive, inappropriate and wrong. Sadly, this
was not so clear in the 1940s,'' Haveman wrote in the December
letter.
</P>
<P>
   ''Thankfully, we have learned from the horrors of the past and
no longer continue the painful policies you suffered. ... I
congratulate you on rising above the ignorance of that time
period.''
</P>
<P>
   Aslin, who lives in Hobbs, Ind., said he harbors no resentment
toward the state of Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's been so long, I don't really have any ill feelings toward
them,'' he said. ''It still bothers me to talk about it now.''

Chinese Pledge To Fight Corruption
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   BEIJING (AP) -- China's top law enforcers pledged fresh efforts Friday to
battle corruption, telling the legislature that lawbreakers will be severely
punished ''no matter who they are.'' Both Xiao Yang, China's top judge, and Han
Zhubin, the top prosecutor, cited Wednesday's execution of a corrupt deputy
provincial governor in telling legislators of their resolve to step up efforts
against graft, bribery and embezzlement. Xiao announced a two-year initiative to
clean up and improve county-level courts, and Han pledged a thorough
investigation of government officials implicated in major smuggling scandals.

U.S. Delivers Aid in Mozambique

<P>
   BEIRA, Mozambique (AP) -- Rain paralyzed aid deliveries to hundreds of
thousands of flood victims in southern Mozambique while the U.S. military
delivered thousands of pounds of rice to hungry people in ravaged central
regions. More rain was forecast for Friday, but military helicopter pilots from
Spain, Britain and other countries planned to try once again to deliver food,
medical supplies and other aid to the flooded Limpopo River valley. U.N. World
Food Program spokeswoman Lindsey Davis said food stored in aid camps would run
out in a day or two unless the flood victims received new supplies.

19 Perish in South Pacific Fire
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   SUVA, Fiji (AP) -- Eighteen teen-age girls and their supervisor were killed
Thursday when a fire tore through a locked dormitory at a high school in the
South Pacific nation of Tuvalu, a government spokesman said. The fire was
believed to have been caused by a student's candle that toppled over in the
girls' dormitory at the Motufoua Secondary School. The dorm was an old wooden
building whose door had been fastened shut and whose open windows were covered
in wire mesh. The girls, ranging between 14 and 17 years old, were locked inside
their rooms when the fire broke out, Radio Tuvalu reporter Diana Semi told
Australia's National Nine News.

Minimum Wage Hike Passes in House
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The House on Thursday approved a $1 increase in the
minimum wage over two years and a 10-year, $122 billion Republican tax cut. The
vote was 246-179 for a bipartisan amendment boosting the $5.15-an-hour wage by
$1 over two years. The amendment replaced a GOP plan to raise the wage by $1
over three years. Earlier, the House voted 257-169 for the GOP tax bill,
two-thirds of it cuts in estate taxes. Meanwhile, President Clinton vowed to
veto the measure, saying the tax relief disproportionately benefits the wealthy
and would consume a chunk of the projected budget surplus that could be used to
shore up Social Security and Medicare.

Gore Easily Wins S.C. Caucus
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) -- Vice President Al Gore won South Carolina's Democratic
caucus vote Thursday night, an event that became largely irrelevant after Bill
Bradley dropped out. Bradley quit the race earlier in the day after Gore's Super
Tuesday blowout in 15 states. Although party officials said they did not have a
complete breakdown of delegates, Gore appeared well on his way to winning all 43
of the delegates at stake in the precinct caucuses. With 72 percent of precincts
reporting, Gore had 6,936 votes to 143 for Bradley.

No. 9 Arizona Defeats No. 2 Stanford
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   TUCSON, Ariz. (AP) -- The ninth-ranked Arizona Wildcats used intense pressure
defense and a balanced, aggressive offense in the second half and made it a
season sweep of No. 2 Stanford 86-81 Thursday night. Richard Jefferson, who
broke his right foot in Arizona's 68-65 victory at Stanford Jan. 8 and was
scoreless in his first two games back last week, scored 19 points off the bench
for the Wildcats, 13 in the second half. Michael Wright added 20 for Arizona

Stanford.

Marino Yet To Make Decision
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- Former Miami Dolphins quarterback Dan Marino has yet to make up
his mind concerning retirement, his agent said Thursday as several broadcast
reports aired saying the player would call it quits next week. Marvin Demoff,
Marino's agent, told ESPN.com that Marino had yet to decide whether he would
retire or stay in football, perhaps by accepting an offer from the Minnesota
Vikings. Dolphins president Eddie Jones said the reports that Marino had decided
to retire were news to him.

<HEADLINE> Kansas St. Reportedly Fires Asbury  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- Tom Asbury was fired as Kansas State
men's basketball coach after a first-round loss in the Big 12
tournament, The Kansas City Star reported in Friday's editions.
</P>
<P>
   An official announcement was to be made Friday, according to the
newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   Asbury and the Wildcats left Kansas City after Thursday's 84-60
loss to Kansas and could not be reached.
</P>
<P>
   Rumors swirled during the tournament that Asbury would be fired
after a 9-19 season.
</P>
<P>
   School chancellor Jon Wefald declined to comment when contacted
in Manhattan by The Associated Press, and Max Urick, Kansas State
athletic director, did not answer calls to his Kansas City hotel
room. Sports information director Kent Brown also refused to
confirm the reports.
</P>
<P>
   Asbury, who came to Kansas State from Pepperdine six years ago,
was 85-88 at Kansas State after going 125-59 in six years at
Pepperdine.
</P>
<P>
   Asbury has two years remaining on his contract with a base
salary of $165,000.
</P>
<P>
   The Star reported that Chicago Bulls assistant coach Jim
Wooldridge would replace Asbury.
</P>
<P>
   The Wildcats had been hard hit by injuries this season, with the
loss of guard Josh Reid for much of the first half of the season.
But Kansas State also had a penchant for turnovers despite Asbury's
emphasis on solving the problem in practice.

<HEADLINE> Tijuana Officers Eyed in Chief Slay  </HEADLINE>
By ARTURO SALINAS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   TIJUANA, Mexico (AP) -- Prosecutors now believe the
gangland-style assassination of Tijuana's police chief last month
may have been an inside job.
</P>
<P>
   Interviews with six men arrested in the shooting initially led
prosecutors to believe the killing was orchestrated by a drug gang
trying to muscle in on the action in Tijuana.
</P>
<P>
   But prosecutors said Thursday night that after questioning the
suspects further, a new theory emerged: The police chief's deputy
and one of his officers put a hit on him.
</P>
<P>
   Baja California Attorney General Juan Manuel Salazar said
Thursday the testimony made investigators think the two officers
were linked to the drug dealers and had orchestrated the shooting
of Police Chief Alfredo de la Torre, then fled to the United
States. Details of the connection weren't clear.
</P>
<P>
   De la Torre was gunned down Feb. 27 while driving to his office.
Investigators said gunmen fired at least 99 bullets at his car, 57
of which hit him. He died instantly.
</P>
<P>
   The attack caused a public outcry in what may be Mexico's most
violent city. Tijuana, with a population of 1.2 million, has seen
more than 70 murders so far this year -- more than one a day.
</P>
<P>
   The six suspects arrested Wednesday include a former city
official and a former police officer.
</P>
<P>
   According to testimony, the six were to be paid $15,000 by
Assistant Police Chief Juan de Dios Montenegro for the hit but
never saw the money, Salazar said. U.S. officials are searching for
Montenegro and officer Praxedis Osuna Solis.
</P>
<P>
   In a news conference Wednesday, Salazar said the men admitted
working for Vicente Zambada Niebla, whom he identified as the son
of drug trafficker Mario Zambada from the northwestern state of
Sinaloa.
</P>
<P>
   Salazar said the men had killed 14 other people, including
attorney Rodolfo Gallardo, a former state judge who was shot to
death along with his wife, son and a local policeman on Feb. 9.
</P>
<P>
   Officials believe the traffickers wanted to create confusion
that would help them operate without interference, but Salazar said
investigators were looking into other motives as well.
</P>
<P>
   Zambada apparently has been trying to compete with the Arellano
Felix brothers, a notoriously violent drug gang based in Tijuana.
</P>
<P>
   The attorney general said police confiscated several automatic
rifles and other weapons from the suspects.

<HEADLINE> What Will the Western Primary Mean?  </HEADLINE>
By ROBERT GEHRKE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- On the presidential primary calendar,
Super Tuesday is followed by what some are calling Foregone Friday.
</P>
<P>
   After George W. Bush and Al Gore won sweeping victories in
coast-to-coast primaries Tuesday, some began to question the
relevance of today's Western Primary -- the first ever.
</P>
<P>
   But not Utah Gov. Mike Leavitt, who first envisioned a grand,
nine-state Western Primary that would demand the candidates'
attention.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is still a primary. People still have an opportunity to
express their view and participate in the nomination of the
presidential candidate,'' the Republican governor and Bush
supporter said Thursday. ''We've never had that before.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore's opponent, Bill Bradley, quit the Democratic race Thursday
and John McCain halted his Republican challenge to Bush, leaving
Gore and Bush as the presumptive nominees.
</P>
<P>
   But both men must still rack up enough delegates to be nominated
at the party conventions this summer and that's where the Western
Primary, which involves Colorado, Utah and Wyoming, comes in. The
contests offer a total of 91 Republican and 75 Democratic
delegates.
</P>
<P>
   Bush underscored the importance of the primary with a visit
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm here because I want to remind people that it's important
to go to the polls tomorrow,'' he said at an airport rally in
Provo, Utah, before heading for an appearance in Cheyenne, Wyo. ''I
know Senator McCain has effectively taken his name out of
contention, but there's still a primary.''
</P>
<P>
   To date, Bush had won 617 of the 1,034 delegates needed on the
Republican side, and Gore had 1,479 of the 2,170 needed for the
Democratic nomination, according to the AP's count.
</P>
<P>
   Other candidates also have noticed the primary.
</P>
<P>
   McCain focused most of his efforts on Colorado before he
withdrew, and GOP underdog Alan Keyes drew a record crowd of 4,000
to speech Wednesday in Orem, Utah.
</P>
<P>
   ''Even though the vote will be after Senator McCain pulled out,
campaigns had to be contemplating Western issues,'' said Leavitt.
He noted that during Bush's visit Thursday the two discussed
Western land issues and educational accountability.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from the pair of candidate withdrawals, some say other
factors will contribute to low turnout: It is the primary's first
run and voting is on a Friday -- an odd day for elections.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think if we get 20 percent (turnout) that would be quite a
bit,'' said Meghan Holbrook, chairwoman of the Utah Democratic
Party. But, she added, ''I think the fact that it gives people at
least a voice in the presidential process is extremely
significant.''
</P>
<P>
   Others argue that turnout shouldn't be the only measure of
success.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is the first time Utah's had a seat at the table in the
process,'' said Scott Simpson, executive director of the Utah
Republican Party. ''This is going to be a different animal. ...
You're going to have to be a little forgiving.''
</P>
<P>
   Bud Scruggs, a former Brigham Young University political
scientist, expects some of the states that shunned the primary to
jump on the bandwagon in 2004.
</P>
<P>
   One by one, New Mexico, Arizona, Idaho, Nevada, Montana and
South Dakota nixed Leavitt's idea until just two states remained --
Colorado and Utah. The Wyoming Republican Party later agreed to
hold its caucus in conjunction with the primary.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think this year it has to be seen as a step in a larger
process and one that is more likely to be punctuation than power,''
Scruggs said. ''I think the experience of this year will only
heighten the interests of neighboring states to be part of a
Western Primary.''
</P>
<P>
   But Ted Wilson, director of the University of Utah's Hinckley
Institute of Politics, was skeptical.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think they're all looking at the money and saying, 'Hey, we
don't want to spend $600,000 to be an exclamation point,''' he
said. ''When you're parked right next to Super Tuesday ... there's
just no chance of having the kind of influence where they'd (the
candidates) be out here making promises.''

<HEADLINE> McCain Suspends Presidential Run  </HEADLINE>
By MIKE GLOVER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEDONA, Ariz. (AP) -- John McCain is taking a week for ''travel
and reflection'' and aides say the onus is now on George W. Bush to
begin building bridges to those who rallied around McCain.
</P>
<P>
   There was ample evidence that the bridge-building process was
underway.
</P>
<P>
   ''The party needs John McCain to broaden its base, and it's only
by broadening its base is the party going to win,'' McCain campaign
manager Rick Davis said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   On Capitol Hill and in a ''very polite'' telephone call Bush
placed to McCain after he announced he was halting his campaign,
there were signs that Bush was looking for ways to heal the wounds
of a rancorous primary campaign where McCain mounted a surprisingly
strong challenge.
</P>
<P>
   McCain pointedly did not endorse Bush, though some efforts were
launched in that direction. Aides said no pitch for an endorsement
came during the call. ''There was no substance discussed,'' Davis
said.
</P>
<P>
   That was understandable since there is considerable bitterness
in McCain's camp toward the hard-hitting campaign that Bush ran,
and McCain himself is said to be seething at the tactics Bush
employed to drive him from the race. Bush acknowledged as much.
</P>
<P>
   ''John needs some time to think, and I need some time,'' Bush
said.
</P>
<P>
   There will be no quick reconciliation, but several efforts in
that direction are underway because it makes sense for McCain to
eventually join forces since his bargaining power is limited after
being hammered in the primaries.
</P>
<P>
   But Davis argued that McCain demonstrated a surprising ability
to appeal to independents and moderates during these contests,
precisely the type of voters Bush must collect to win the White
House in November.
</P>
<P>
   In announcing the suspension of his campaign, McCain made it
clear that he wants to continue to push issues like campaign
finance reform that were central to his effort.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think what the speech does is put the onus on them and the
Republican Party to reach out,'' said Davis.
</P>
<P>
   As the two camps begin to move together, there is unlikely to be
a formal agreement, but there will be signals sent between the
sides.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Fred Thompson, of Tennessee, a McCain backer, said he's
already been approached about helping McCain transition back to the
Senate and healing the divisions without a ''quid pro quo.''
</P>
<P>
   ''McCain would hope that Bush would see it would be a wise thing
to make some movement toward those independents and Democrats that
we're going to need in November,'' Thompson said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, former Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole, the 1996
GOP nominee, has made contacts with McCain's camp to seek ways of
finding a reconciliation. McCain aides said he wants to ponder his
next step before dealing with those issues.
</P>
<P>
   McCain quit the race, but didn't shut down his operation. That's
a technicality that keeps his options open, including stumping the
country pushing his issues.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Davis said McCain retains the 231 delegates he's
won so far and will take them to the national nominating convention
in Philadelphia in August. Some advisers have suggested McCain
should seek a third-party bid, but that's the least likely option.
</P>
<P>
   McCain himself has ruled out bolting the GOP and said Thursday,
''I love my home.'' He did, however, leave himself a loophole by
saying in his departure speech that the party deserves ''the
allegiance of none'' if it doesn't embrace campaign finance reform.
</P>
<P>
   McCain resisted suggestions that he launch a broadside at Bush.
Instead he traveled to a stunning vista in the mountains of
northern Arizona to deliver a speech listing his achievements.
</P>
<P>
   ''I hoped our campaign would be a force for change in the
Republican Party, and I believe we have indeed set a course that
will ultimately prevail in making our party as big as the country
we serve,'' McCain said.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's no question that there's some bitterness there and
some anger,'' said Sen. Charles Hagel, R-Neb, another McCain
supporter.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's decision got more attention than across the partisan
aisle where Bill Bradley also dropped out of the race for the
Democratic nomination. Vice President Al Gore had beaten Bradley
soundly in early tests, and Bradley quickly endorsed Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley did complain that Gore distorted his record, and said he
hoped Gore will run a different kind of general election campaign.

<HEADLINE> Bush Turns Attention to Gore  </HEADLINE>
By GLEN JOHNSON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHEYENNE, Wyo. (AP) -- George W. Bush has retooled his stump
speech, carefully clipping out references to John McCain and
consciously pasting in the name of Vice President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Audiences in Colorado, Utah and Wyoming -- which hold primaries
today -- heard the putative Republican presidential nominee chastise
his Democratic opponent while offering only plaudits for McCain,
who suspended his campaign for the GOP nomination on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ''The best way to reform Washington, D.C., is to end the
Clinton-Gore era,'' Bush told about 1,500 people who braved snow
and fog to hear the Texas governor speak at the Cheyenne Civic
Center.
</P>
<P>
   Pausing at points where he used to criticize McCain, Bush
instead challenged Gore with a chorus that began, ''For eight years
....'' Each line ended with complaints about the administration's
policies on schools, taxes and low morale in the military.
</P>
<P>
   ''What kind of signal does that send, Mr. Vice President?'' Bush
asked Thursday before an audience of about 600 at the airport in
Provo, Utah. ''It says an administration that is overdeploying and
underfunding our military. When I become president, our troops will
be well paid.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush also complained that Gore talks about eliminating
unregulated ''soft money'' from election campaigns while planning
to lead his party's efforts to raise $35 million in such funds.
</P>
<P>
   ''Mr. Gore, I'm not going to let you get away with it,'' Bush
told about 200 cheering supporters outside the Denver Broncos'
football practice facility in Englewood, Colo. ''We're not going to
be fooled by somebody who says one thing and absolutely does
something else.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush said the public doesn't have amnesia, and alluded to some
of Gore's past problems.
</P>
<P>
   ''He must think we have forgotten Buddhist temples and
fund-raising affairs. In order to change, in order to reform
Washington, we need to clean house out of Washington, D.C,'' Bush
said.
</P>
<P>
   Offering a taste of the general election battle to come, Gore
responded immediately when Bush criticized him about campaign
funding reform.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has challenged his GOP rival to give up so-called soft
money -- unlimited donations to the political parties that they
spend on issue ads to help their candidates.
</P>
<P>
   ''All he has to do is agree to the challenge with no conditions,
no perquisites,'' Gore said in Washington. ''All he has to do is
say 'yes.' Ban all soft money from this campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   Taking a more direct approach, Gore's campaign spokesman Chris
Lehane criticized Bush for $2.5 million in TV ads against McCain by
two of the governor's financial supporters. Bush has said he had no
connection to the ads, which were paid for by Texas investors
Charles and Sam Wyly.
</P>
<P>
   ''Today's attack is a wily attempt to avoid fallout from John
McCain's complaint about possible illegal campaign spending,''
Lehane said.
</P>
<P>
   Before suspending his campaign, McCain filed a complaint with
the Federal Election Commission about the ads, which he described
as an illegal contribution to Bush's campaign since Charles Wyly
had raised at least $100,000 for the Texas governor's effort.
</P>
<P>
   Bush also paid homage to McCain, who surprised him with an
unexpectedly strong challenge.
</P>
<P>
   ''He campaigned hard for what he believes and I appreciate so
very much his willingness to enter the arena and talk about issues
that were dear to his heart,'' said Bush. ''I know the competition
has made me a better candidate. I know the competition is going to
help us win the White House come November.''
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's schedule not only allowed Bush to campaign in three
more primary states, it also gave him a chance to appear with three
Republican governors who support him.
</P>
<P>
   In Colorado, Gov. Bill Owens accompanied Bush to the Broncos
camp. In Utah, Gov. Mike Leavitt at Bush's side in Provo. And in
Cheyenne, Gov. Jim Geringer introduced Bush.
</P>
<P>
   He took his own potshot at Gore, complaining that the vice
president hadn't called him during his five years in office. ''So
nuts to you, Mr. Gore,'' Geringer said to cheers.
</P>
<P>
   Bush planned to stay in Texas until Sunday, when he begins a
two-day campaign swing to Florida, Tennessee, Louisiana,
Mississippi and Oklahoma.

<HEADLINE> Stark Choices in Bush-Gore Race  </HEADLINE>
By CALVIN WOODWARD, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The battle shaping up between Al Gore and
George W. Bush is also a struggle between mandatory licensing of
future handgun buyers and much more limited gun controls.
</P>
<P>
   It's between a tax cut most families would feel and a health
plan that would help more people get insurance. There's an offer to
pay thousands of public schoolteachers more money and one to help
parents afford private schools when public schools fail them -- and
their children.
</P>
<P>
   Gore and Bush are offering voters some clear choices as they
prepare to go head to head for the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is in some ways as profound an ideological difference as
there has been since (Ronald) Reagan and (Jimmy) Carter in 1980 --
if you dig into it,'' said Michael Franc, vice president for
government relations at the conservative Heritage Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   Digging is required because Gore, the Democratic vice president,
a self-styled pragmatic ''reinventer'' of government, and Bush, the
Republican governor of Texas, a ''compassionate conservative,'' can
sound alike when they are not speaking to the ideological wings of
their parties.
</P>
<P>
   On health care, for one issue, Gore proposes changes that are
modest by comparison with those of his vanquished Democratic rival
and modest, too, alongside the grand vision of universal health
care abandoned by the administration he serves.
</P>
<P>
   But his plan -- to let more families above the poverty line
qualify for federally supported state insurance and attach a drug
benefit to Medicare -- is much more ambitious and expensive than
anything Bush has put on the table.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Bush proposes across-the-board tax cuts larger
even than the congressional Republican package that Democrats
attacked as too costly last year, and which Clinton vetoed. Gore
offers selective tax relief here and there.
</P>
<P>
   As well, Bush stands for partial privatization of Social
Security, proposes expanded medical savings accounts and spells out
a way for parents to use federal tax money to get their children
out of failing public schools -- ideas roundly opposed by Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Those ideas have simmered in Congress for a decade but only now
are emerging with force in a presidential campaign. On the
Republican side, Franc argues, that sets the governor apart from
Bob Dole's campaign in 1996 and President Bush in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   ''A lot of conservative thinking that might have been trendy or
outside the envelope in the early '90s is now much more widely
accepted,'' he said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Because the ground has shifted, ''I see Bush as being to the
right of Dole, to the right of his dad.''
</P>
<P>
   Al From, president of the centrist Democratic Leadership
Council, said the differences between Gore and Bush are more
pronounced than might have been expected from two men who share a
moderate impulse.
</P>
<P>
   From contends that Bush formed his centrist message ''on the
cheap,'' without the painstaking policy foundation laid by Bill
Clinton in 1992. That left Bush ill-equipped to stay in the center
when the primaries got rough, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Clinton built his own philosophical base in the party that he
could fall back on when he got in trouble,'' From said. ''Because
Bush didn't do that, he had to fall back on the people who were the
establishment.''
</P>
<P>
   As a result, he said, Gore can draw strong contrasts with Bush
on some of the social and economic issues where they might
otherwise have been closer.
</P>
<P>
   Gore and Bush both want more accountability in return for
federal education money, including standardized tests. They both
like charter schools. But Gore's ideas for school choice and higher
teacher pay deal solely with public schools while Bush ultimately
provides a way out.
</P>
<P>
   On gun control, Bush supports background checks for gun
purchases if they are instant, among other measures that do not go
as far as Gore's.
</P>
<P>
   On abortion, the choice is between a Democrat who supports the
full range of abortion rights and a Republican who says the
procedure should be illegal except in cases of rape, incest or to
save the life of the pregnant woman.
</P>
<P>
   Neither has committed explicitly to nominating only Supreme
Court justices who share their abortion views. But both have used
language suggesting a nominee's potential impact on abortion law
would be kept in mind.

<HEADLINE> Supporters Pressure Perot To Run  </HEADLINE>
By LAURIE KELLMAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Ross Perot's top aide says it would ''take
something of a miracle'' to convince him to make a third White
House bid on the ticket of his besieged Reform Party.
</P>
<P>
   But that hasn't stopped supporters from trying to change his
mind with a petition drive.
</P>
<P>
   ''He hasn't said to stop,'' said supporter Pat Muth of
Tallahassee, Fla., who helped national party secretary Jim Mangia
organize news events across the country Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Perot so far has shown no interest in running again.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am not optimistic Ross is going to make another run. ... If
he wanted it he would be doing the preparatory work,'' said Russell
Verney, Perot's top aide. ''It would take something of a miracle to
get him to run for office again.''
</P>
<P>
   At sparsely attended news conferences in more than a dozen
cities, Reform Party members who say a Perot candidacy will help
boost the party's stature argued that his silence was reason enough
to go forward with efforts to draft him into the race.
</P>
<P>
   Minnesota Gov. Jesse Ventura had been Reform's highest elected
officeholder and one of the party's most public faces until he cut
his ties to the national organization last month, saying it was
''hopelessly dysfunctional.''
</P>
<P>
   Pat Buchanan, a former Republican, is seeking the Reform Party's
presidential nomination, which comes with $12.6 million in federal
campaign subsidies.
</P>
<P>
   ''Reform is going to lose its credibility unless Perot gets back
in the race,'' said Morgan Erlanson, 39, from Orange, Calif., about
40 miles southeast of Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   In Perot's home city of Dallas, four of his supporters said they
would join a nationwide organization called the Committee to Draft
Perot 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ''There have been many politicians who say 'reform this' and
'reform that,' but it never seems to get enough force to do
anything because we have lobbyists who write the legislation and
our representatives and senators ... they don't read it,'' said
Jude Hoeper, one the four.
</P>
<P>
   In Los Angeles, five Reform Party members said they have
collected 10,000 petition signatures to draft Perot into the race.
</P>
<P>
   ''I feel he's an honest candidate,'' said Karen Mountain, 32, of
Austin, Texas, who took her 8-year-old daughter to the California
city. ''He speaks what we need to hear, not what we want to hear.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the news events didn't make much news.
</P>
<P>
   In Louisville, Ky., Reform Party State Chairman John Longmire
found himself alone on the Jefferson County Courthouse steps at the
appointed hour, but no reporters showed up.
</P>
<P>
   He said having two marquee names on the ballot -- Perot and
Buchanan -- would compel coverage.
</P>
<P>
   ''Ross Perot would lend substance to the reform agenda,''
Longmire said. ''To have both of them running for the Reform Party
nomination, I think would get a lot of attention.''
</P>
<P>
   Attention hasn't been the party's problem, thanks to a raucous
meeting of the national party last month in Nashville, Tenn., that
local police threatened to shut down several times. Donald Trump's
flirtation with a presidential bid on the ticket also drew some
coverage for a time.

<HEADLINE> Pentagon: No Proof on NATO Spy  </HEADLINE>
By PAULINE JELINEK, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Some NATO officials believe a spy leaked
military plans to the Serbs in the Kosovo war last year, but no one
has been able to prove them right or wrong, the Pentagon says.
</P>
<P>
   ''No one can definitively say that there wasn't a mole of some
sort, but there is no evidence there was,'' Pentagon spokesman
Kenneth Bacon Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The British Broadcasting Corp. earlier in the day released
details of a documentary alleging that a mole supplied information
on the allies' strike plans and flight paths in the first two weeks
of the air campaign, allowing Serbs to move troops and equipment
away from intended NATO targets.
</P>
<P>
   Bacon said there were indications that the Serbs had some
advance knowledge of plans, but he blamed it on a system of
distributing air tasking orders to member nations by fax. When the
procedures were changed, ''the problem went away,'' said Bacon, on
a trip to Asia with Defense Secretary William Cohen.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, Rear Adm. Craig Quigley said there also were
''communication intercepts -- too many of the allied aircraft sent
their transmissions in the clear,'' so those procedures were
tightened as well.
</P>
<P>
   ''We were always sensitive to security and that meant that
throughout the campaign we were consistently reviewing security,''
NATO Secretary-General Lord Robertson said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ''Results of the air campaign speak for themselves. The NATO air
cover did all that it was asked. The refugees are now home,
underlying the success of the air campaign,'' Robertson said.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Bacon said, ''There are people in NATO who believe
there could have been a mole.''
</P>
<P>
   NATO launched its 78-day bombing campaign of Yugoslavia in March
1999 to force President Slobodan Milosevic to halt his crackdown
against ethnic Albanians in the southern province of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Serb forces shot down a U.S. stealth bomber during the conflict.
</P>
<P>
   The BBC program to be aired Sunday, ''Moral Combat: NATO at
War,'' claims that an internal classified report prepared for
senior U.S. defense officials concluded that the Serbs had
information on air raids and reconnaissance flights. It says U.S.
Gen. Wesley Clark, NATO's supreme commander, suspected that
information was leaking and ordered an investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if there was a spy at NATO headquarters, Clark told the
BBC: ''Absolutely not.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether there was a spy ''in NATO,'' he replied. ''I don't
think so.''
</P>
<P>
   It is not the first time spy allegations regarding Yugoslavia
have been made.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, a French army major was arrested on charges of spying
for Yugoslavia while he was chief of staff for the French
delegation at NATO headquarters in Brussels, months before the air
campaign began. He was released by a French appeals court.

<HEADLINE> China IPO Not Attractive to AFL-CIO  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID BRISCOE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- An effort by China to raise $5 billion by
offering stock in its national oil company comes amid high oil
prices and strong investor interest in new offerings -- and strong
opposition from the American labor movement.
</P>
<P>
   Warning that investment in the PetroChina initial public
offering (IPO) carries high risk and could bolster an abusive
regime, the AFL-CIO is launching its first assault against a
planned international stock offer.
</P>
<P>
   AFL-CIO President John J. Sweeney called more than two dozen key
financial analysts Thursday to warn of risks with the Chinese stock
and express concern over labor problems and human rights abuses in
China, the labor federation said.
</P>
<P>
   A top investment bank, Goldman Sachs &AMP; Co., is beginning an
international effort next week to spur interest in the PetroChina
IPO. Share prices have not yet been set, and Goldman, the lead
underwriter of the offering, declined to comment on the stock,
citing the Wall Street tradition of a ''quiet period'' around the
time of a new equity offer.
</P>
<P>
   ''We think this deal is impossible to reform,'' said Bill
Patterson, AFL-CIO investment director. ''There is no way this
transaction, with the relationship to the Chinese state, can be
structured in a way to protect investors.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that with billions in union members' savings and pension
funds invested abroad, U.S. workers are becoming key investors in
world markets. The action against PetroChina is the first of many
efforts to ensure that those investments are not in entities that
abuse laborers, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The public stock offering, intended for listing on the New York
Stock Exchange and other markets, would make available a 15 percent
share in PetroChina Co. Ltd. to fund its capital spending and
investments and reduce borrowing, according to its Feb. 29 filing.
The company was formed by China National Oil Co., and 85 percent
interest in PetroChina will be retained by the Chinese government.
</P>
<P>
   Little information is readily available about planned operation
of PetroChina, however, since as a foreign entity, it was not
required to file its offering electronically. It is the Chinese
government's producer of crude oil and natural gas.
</P>
<P>
   The stock offering has some attraction because it comes at a
time of high global oil prices and amid strong support from the
Clinton administration for granting China permanent normal trade
status and membership in the World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
   The AFL-CIO also opposes those steps, and China has strong
opponents on Capitol Hill.
</P>
<P>
   The congressionally-mandated U.S. Commission on International
Religious Freedom last month appointed a task force to monitor its
plans to raise money on U.S. stock markets. The commission objects
to the Chinese oil company's projects in Sudan, which is under U.S.
sanctions for human rights abuses.

<HEADLINE> Census Undercount Could Cost $11B  </HEADLINE>
By GENARO C. ARMAS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- California and Texas would be deprived of more
than half of the $11 billion in federal aid that states could lose
if the population undercount in this year's census is similar to
the undercount in 1990, a study by a Census Bureau oversight panel
said.
</P>
<P>
   Urban counties also would take a financial hit if a more
accurate head count does not occur, or if a statistical method
known as sampling is not used to account for missing people, said
the report released Thursday by the presidential appointees of the
U.S. Census Monitoring Board.
</P>
<P>
   According to the study, California would lose $5 billion and
Texas $1.9 billion, while the five counties that make up New York
City would together lose more than $2.5 billion. It also notes that
other states could gain money, predicting a $2 billion windfall for
Pennsylvania, and more than $1 billion for Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's less a question of not having as much or having more than
it is the money that's intended for other groups,'' board co-chair
Gilbert F. Casellas said. ''While on a statewide basis you may
consider yourself getting a larger number of dollars because of
your count, based on the analysis, certain cities within those
states actually lose out because of the effects.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. David Murray, a congressional appointee to the board, said
he enthusiastically supported the report if its purpose was to
spark more people to respond. More people may send forms back if
they know what census results are used for, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''But if the major point is to use this as a weapon in a
political fight, then I'd be very disappointed,'' Murray said.
There is a ''temptation to say that statistical methods will solve
these problems.''
</P>
<P>
   The Census Bureau estimates it undercounted 1.4 percent of the
population, and favors using sampling to account for those people --
mostly children, minorities and residents in urban areas who tend
to vote Democratic.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans favor using a strict head count, claiming it
provides the most accurate statistics possible.
</P>
<P>
   The study looked at eight federal programs which comprise 82
percent of the $185 billion allocated to states in 1998. The study
is based on a projected undercount of 1.75 percent in 2000, but
said those forecasts are conservative because the Census Bureau has
predicted an undercount of 1.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
   A 1999 Supreme Court decision mandated that only nonsampled data
be used for reapportioning congressional seats, but left open the
possibility of using sampled data to redraw political boundaries
and redistribute federal funding.
</P>
<P>
   The Census Bureau is scheduled to release both sampled and
nonsampled data. Bureau officials declined to comment on the study.
</P>
<P>
   The study, performed for the board by PricewaterhouseCoopers,
forecasted funds for the 10 fiscal years following 2002, when new
formulas based on 2000 census figures could kick in.
</P>
<P>
   The eight-member monitoring board was established by Congress to
oversee Census 2000 operations. Four members were appointed by
President Clinton and four by the Republican-majority Congress.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Vows To Help U.S. Indians  </HEADLINE>
By SONYA ROSS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton made a direct appeal for
American Indians to vote for Democratic candidates in elections
this fall, saying his party is completely committed to their
concerns.
</P>
<P>
   In a speech Thursday to American Indians who gave a total
$350,000 to Democratic congressional candidates, Clinton cast them
as victims of a negligent U.S. government that took away land and
mineral rights while giving them little in return. He promised to
remedy that.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is the part of our historical legacy we want to be proud
of, and it will never be right until we get it right,'' Clinton
said. ''This is a country that's supposed to be founded on equal
opportunity, equal justice, mutual respect, everybody having a
chance.''
</P>
<P>
   He asked that American Indians support Democrats in
congressional races, saying the ''very good Republican support'' he
expects to get on his budget proposals on American Indians pales in
comparison to the work that Democrats do on their behalf.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our party has had a consistent, determined leadership position
that goes from top to bottom, throughout the entire United States
Congress, that we support the direction that you advocate,''
Clinton said. ''This is about whether people will be organized and
energized to go out and vote, to recognize that when you lay down
your weapons, you have to pick up your ballot.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's comments on Indians were his most extensive since he
visited the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation in South Dakota last
July. Residents there struggle with high unemployment, substandard
housing and inadequate education -- all of which plague other Indian
reservations as well, Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our real goal ought to be the fundamental empowerment of the
Native American tribes in this country as envisioned by the
Constitution, required by the Supreme Court,'' Clinton said. ''And
I want you to help me ... get this nation-to-nation relationship
right in a way that will allow you all to be lifted up.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the Census Bureau and the Bureau of Indian Affairs,
1.43 million Indians live on or near reservations. Only 63 percent
of Indians are high school graduates, 29 percent are homeless and
59 percent live in substandard housing.
</P>
<P>
   The president said he keeps traditional Native American
artifacts -- drums, eagle feathers, a tobacco pouch -- in his office
as a reminder of ''my solemn obligation'' to address their needs.
He recalled reading, as a child, the words of Chief Joseph of the
Nez Perce: ''From this day, I will fight no more forever.''
</P>
<P>
   ''You made that pledge and you got a bad deal,'' Clinton said.
''The deal never worked out in a way that was fair to both sides
and honorable.''
</P>
<P>
   The fund-raiser was the first of two events Thursday in which
Clinton focused on racial healing.
</P>
<P>
   At the other, a gathering of religious leaders at the White
House, the president reiterated his belief that African immigrant
Amadou Diallo likely would not have been killed by police had he
been white. He said Diallo's death pointed out a need for training
police to be more sensitive to the communities they serve -- while
addressing more directly the pressures that police officers face.
</P>
<P>
   ''I wish I could bring that boy back for his mother and his
friends, to give him the life he should have had. But I can't do
that,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   The White House gathering brought together Christians, Jews,
Muslims, Hindus, Baha'is, Catholic priests and one Buddhist monk in
a saffron-colored robe. They agreed to formally teach that racism
is a sin, and also reported on efforts within their faiths to deal
with racism, with varying degrees of progress.
</P>
<P>
   Bishop S. Clifton Ives, United Methodist bishop for West
Virginia, said his denomination is seeking a way through which
white followers can be ''challenged on the notion of white
privilege, and that will be hard for some.'' Rosa Banks, human
relations director of the Seventh-day Adventists, said ''our
commitment is being tested'' after dialogues uncovered other sore
spots, ''but we have solidly planted race relations on our
agenda.''

<HEADLINE> Notes and Quotes From Campaign 2000  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT (AP) -- Vice President Al Gore summoned a Japanese
television crew and pair of scissors -- it was comeuppance time for
the Gore campaign's prankster, er, press secretary, Chris Lehane.
</P>
<P>
   Gore was down to the last two voter questions of his three-hour
town meeting Wednesday at Wayne State University when Lehane,
waiting on a folded chair nearby began to squirm. A news
photographer had quietly fastened Lehane's belt loop to the chair
with a thick plastic ''zip tie.''
</P>
<P>
   Anything to liven things up on Day 65 of virtually nonstop
travel.
</P>
<P>
   Gore shook his head. ''I was over there engaged in an open
meeting and I come over here ... .''
</P>
<P>
   The immobile, deeply flushed, and always quip-ready Lehane
interrupted, ''I'm very attached to the open meetings, sir.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore cajoled, even threatened that the motorcade would leave
without him, but Lehane would not stand with that chair affixed to
his rear.
</P>
<P>
   Gore called forward the Japanese TV crew, which has been
following Lehane for a campaign documentary, and directed the
cameraman's close-ups of Lehane's bottom. ''OK,'' Gore pointed.
''Are you getting this? Get this right here.''
</P>
<P>
   After clipping the stubborn tie with bandage scissors his medic
had on hand, Gore saluted the culprit with a high-five.
</P>
<P>
   It was Lehane, after all, who started the hijinks earlier that
night, roping the belt loop of trip director David Morehouse's
jeans to a stack of folding chairs.

   THIS DATE FOUR YEARS AGO:

<P>
   Campaigning in Miami, Steve Forbes resisted calls from former
Vice President Dan Quayle and others that he drop out of the race.
Quayle said the longer Forbes stays in, the more harm he will do to
the flat-tax issue he holds so dear. Forbes replied, ''It's not his
decision to make, and I'm taking my message to the voters. If this
campaign was simply about personalities, he'd have a point. But
this campaign is about issues.'' In a photo-op snipe at Dole,
Forbes portrayed the Senate majority leader as a politician with no

   Bradley said he will support Vice President Al Gore despite
their sometimes bitter rivalry because ''now it is time for unity''
to win the White House. McCain ''suspended'' his campaign because
''a majority of Republican voters made clear that their preference
for president is Governor Bush.'' McCain did not endorse Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, in Colorado, Bush criticized Gore for talking about
eliminating unregulated ''soft money'' in election campaigns while
published reports say he will headline party efforts to raise
millions in soft money that will help his presidential campaign.

   ''America is not going to be fooled by the difference between
rhetoric and reality,'' Bush said.

<HEADLINE> High Turnout Attributed to McCain  </HEADLINE>
By WILL LESTER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Record turnout in many Republican presidential
primaries this year was more a sign of dissatisfaction with the
current political system than a cause for euphoria, says the
director of a group that monitors voter turnout.
</P>
<P>
   And the high showings are no indicator of voter enthusiasm for
the fall because it was based largely on one candidate -- and he's
no longer running.
</P>
<P>
   ''The story of this primary season was McCain,'' said Curtis
Gans, director of the Committee for the Study of the American
Electorate. He was referring to Arizona Sen. John McCain, who
suspended his bid for the GOP presidential nomination on Thursday
after losing to George W. Bush in many states earlier in the week.
</P>
<P>
   ''McCain mobilized alienated independents and disaffected
Democrats into Republican primaries,'' Gans said Thursday. ''He
spawned an organizational counterrevolution from Christian
conservatives and regular Republicans.''
</P>
<P>
   Turnout in the 18 Republican contests held so far was up 4.3
percentage points from 1996, to 13.6 percent of the voting age
population. That was the highest level in GOP primaries since the
14.8 percent of 1964, when another Arizona lightning rod, Sen.
Barry Goldwater, ran for president, according to the committee's
report.
</P>
<P>
   New GOP presidential primary turnout records were set in New
Hampshire, South Carolina, Washington state, Michigan, Ohio,
Virginia, Missouri, Georgia, Massachusetts, Maryland, Rhode Island
and Vermont.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was McCain, simply McCain, recruiting people from outside
the party and some disaffected Democrats,'' said Gans. ''He had
this biography of a hero, he seemed to talk in less programmed
language, he was generally appealing.''
</P>
<P>
   Turnout rose higher, Gans said, because ''McCain was very
hostile to the Republican establishment, then took on leaders of
the Christian right. He gave (Republicans) reason to mobilize.''
</P>
<P>
   Democratic turnout in the primaries was the second lowest in 40
years, 10.1 percent of the voting age population, with only the
uncontested renomination of President Clinton in 1996 coming in
lower, according to Gans' report.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans were in a ''celebrity death match ... wrestling
for the heart and soul of their party,'' said Democratic National
Committee spokeswoman Jenny Backus. GOP officials have cited the
high turnout and crossover voters as a sign of Republican strength.
</P>
<P>
   But Gans noted that in caucuses and primaries such as Iowa and
Delaware in which McCain was not a contestant, turnout was lower.
</P>
<P>
   ''The message of the turnout is that there's a lot of alienation
out there, particularly among the independents,'' Gans said. ''It's
precisely the opposite of euphoria. It was unhappy people looking
for hope.''

<HEADLINE> Community groups take their fight against FAA weather tower tocourt  </HEADLINE>
By PAT MILTON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- After years of wrangling, a dispute over a
proposed high-tech weather tower in south Brooklyn has landed
before a three judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals.
</P>
<P>
   At issue is whether the law that created the National Gateway
Park permits the expansion of air facilities on property designated
for recreational use.
</P>
<P>
   A coalition of community and environmental groups went to court
Thursday seeking to block the Federal Aviation Administration from
placing the tower on the former Floyd Bennett Field, located in the
park.
</P>
<P>
   John Minardo, attorney for the Friends of the Gateway coalition,
told the judges that constructing the tower is illegal under the
Park statute.
</P>
<P>
   ''When it came to Floyd Bennett, the congress did not want any
expansion of the air facility and this would be expansion,''
Minardo said.
</P>
<P>
   But an FAA attorney argued that the statute does not apply in
this case because the proposed tower site is outside the
recreational portion of the National Park.
</P>
<P>
   ''This property is on the outer limits of what could be
considered recreation area,'' the attorney, Jeff Dobbins told the
court.
</P>
<P>
   The FAA contends that the 117-foot Terminal Doppler Weather
Radar tower -- which would serve Kennedy and La Guardia Airports --
is needed to help pilots detect adverse conditions, such as
windshear, that can effect takeoffs and landings.
</P>
<P>
   In deciding on the site, the FAA concluded that the best
location for the tower is on the property in question, just north
of the Rockaway Peninsula.
</P>
<P>
   The opposition says the issue is not aircraft safety, but
politics. They argue that the FAA picked its location only after
two Nassau County communities rejected proposals to site the tower
within their borders.
</P>
<P>
   The tower's opponents argue that the 12-story structure with its
37-foot diameter dish would not only mar the view in the park, but
endanger the environment.
</P>
<P>
   ''We want to see flowers not towers,'' Marie Artesi, of the
Floyd Bennett Garden Association, said outside of court.
</P>
<P>
   ''In urban New York, people of low and moderate incomes need a
place of refuge. That is what the Gateway Park provides,'' Artesi
said. ''They don't want to be faced with a tower radiating we don't
know what on our gardens.''
</P>
<P>
   The Garden Association sponsors public areas in the park where
people can grow fruits, flowers and vegetables. It is considered
one of the largest community gardens in the country.
</P>
<P>
   The Court is expected to issue its ruling within the next three
months.

<HEADLINE> Spring Training Roundup  </HEADLINE>
By The Associated Press	   A couple of years ago, it would have caused a
bold-faced
headline: RIPKEN HURT.
<TEXT>
<P>
   But these days, it's only slightly more than a note.
</P>
<P>
   Cal Ripken strained a neck muscle during batting practice before
Thursday's game against St. Louis. He was removed from the
Baltimore's starting lineup before a 5-4 victory over St. Louis at
Fort Lauderdale, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   ''I just felt a little strain in my upper (trapezius) muscle
that went up to my neck,'' said Ripken, who ended his record
consecutive games played streak at 2,632 two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Ripken played in only 86 games and made two trips to
the disabled list, the first of his 19-year career. He was nine
hits shy of 3,000 when back surgery ended his season Sept. 23.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm sure during the season I could have played. I'm sure I
could have played today,'' he said. ''It can't be anything more
than just a mild strain.''
</P>
<P>
   In Mesa, Ariz., Sammy Sosa had his first multihomer game of the
year, not that it counts for very much.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not about home runs,'' Sosa said after connecting twice
in the Chicago Cubs' 11-7 victory over the San Francisco Giants.
</P>
<P>
   Sosa, who has 129 regular-season homers in the past two years,
hit a major league-high 14 during spring training last year. This
year, he's putting less emphasis on them.
</P>
<P>
   ''I can do a lot of other things,'' he said. ''I don't want
people to get confused. I want to contribute to this team.''
</P>
<P>
   In Tucson, Ariz., Jay Buhner homered twice in the Seattle
Mariners' 9-8, 10-inning loss to the Arizona Diamondbacks.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm feeling great right now, so ride the wave,'' said Buhner,
who hit just 29 homers combined in the past two seasons. ''I'm
going to be selfish right now. I think I have a lot to prove, not
only to the people out there, but to myself, that I'm healthy, that
I can get myself ready for the season.''
</P>
<P>
   In Kissimmee, Fla., Steve Avery accomplished his goals in his
first spring outing.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was pain-free and I got three outs,'' he said after
pitching a hitless inning in the Atlanta Braves' 8-7 victory over a
Los Angeles Dodgers split squad.
</P>
<P>
   With John Smoltz sidelined for the season, there's renewed focus
on Avery, a star for the Braves in the early 1990s who came to camp
with a minor league contract.
</P>
<P>
   ''I felt good. It's a long way from where I want to be,'' Avery
said. ''I was telling Chipper (Jones) I was ending up in positions
I didn't know I could get into because my mechanics were so off.''
</P>
<P>
   In other games:
Phillies 5, Yankees 3:
</P>
<P>
   At Clearwater, Fla., Ron Ducey's grand slam off Darrell
Einertson keyed a five-run fourth that helped drop the two-time
World Series champions to 1-7. Yankees starter Orlando Hernandez,
who missed a week this spring with a lower back injury, had a
successful debut, limiting the Phillies to one hit and no runs in
two innings.
Red Sox 8, Rangers 6:
</P>
<P>
   At Port Charlotte, Fla., Gary Gaetti hit a two-run homer off
Rick Helling in the first inning and a game-winning single off
David Elder in the 11th.
Astros 9, Mets 3:
</P>
<P>
   At Kissimmee, Fla., Ken Caminiti went 2-for-3 with three RBIs.
John Nunnally homered for the Mets and has hits in his last eight
at-bats, including four homers.
Reds (ss) 6, Twins (ss) 5:
</P>
<P>
   At Sarasota, Fla., Ken Griffey Jr. homered for the second
straight game and the third time this spring, a two-run shot in the
fourth off Joe Mays.
Devil Rays (ss) 2, Reds (ss) 1:
</P>
<P>
   At St. Petersburg, Fla., Jose Canseco homered for the Devil
Rays, who won on Alex Sanchez's two-out, ninth-inning RBI single
off John Riedling.
Royals (ss) 14, Devil Rays (ss) 2:
</P>
<P>
   At Haines City, Fla., Carlos Beltran hit a three-run homer and
Carlos Febles a two-run double during a seven-run fourth. Seven
Tampa Bay pitchers gave up 15 hits and 12 walks.
Royals (ss) 5, Dodgers (ss) 2:
</P>
<P>
   At Vero Beach, Fla., Joe Randa's two-run homer capped a four-run
rally off Alan Mills in the eighth that overcame homers by Adrian
Beltre and Todd Hundley.
Twins (ss) 5, Indians 1 (ss):
</P>
<P>
   At Fort Myers, Fla., Cristian Guzman hit his first home run of
the spring.
Indians (ss) 6, Tigers 6, tie:
</P>
<P>
   At Lakeland, Fla., Matt Nokes drove in four runs in an 11-inning
tie. Bobby Higginson hit a three-run homer for Detroit.
Expos 4, Marlins 3:
</P>
<P>
   At Jupiter, Fla., Trace Coquillette tied the score with a solo
homer in the eighth off Nelson Lara and won it with a RBI single in
the 10th off Claudio Vargas, giving the Expos their fourth straight
win.
Pirates 2, Blue Jays 1:
</P>
<P>
   At Dunedin, Fla., David Wells was perfect in his first start of
the spring, retiring six straight batters.
White Sox 7, Padres 1:
</P>
<P>
   At Peoria, Ariz., Sterling Hitchcock, making his first spring
start after being slowed by a bad left ankle, was pounded for five
runs and five hits in 2 2-3 innings.
Angels 7, Brewers 6:
</P>
<P>
   At Tempe, Ariz., rookie Mike Colangelo's RBI single in the
bottom of the ninth off Mike Rossiter drove in Orlando Palmeiro
with the winning run.
Athletics 5, Rockies 0:
</P>
<P>
   At Phoenix, Kevin Appier combined with four relievers on a
five-hitter. Mike Magnante and Scott Service each threw two
scoreless innings, and Terry Burrows and Will Brunson each added a
scoreless inning for the A's.

<HEADLINE> Officer Shadows LSU Stars  </HEADLINE>
By PAUL NEWBERRY, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA (AP) -- Stromile Swift sat behind the basket, slurping on
a frozen drink and scouting LSU's opponent for today's second round
of the Southeastern Conference tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Lurking right behind was a nondescript, middle-aged man, who
kept a keen eye on Swift.
</P>
<P>
   Agents beware: No. 10 LSU is taking no chances after Auburn's
Chris Porter lost his eligibility for taking $2,500 in violation of
NCAA rules. Coach John Brady has assigned a group of undercover
officers to shadow his stars, Swift and Jabari Smith, and ward off
unsavory elements.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a pro-active approach,'' Brady said Thursday during a
first-round game between Vanderbilt and Mississippi State. ''We
want to discourage anyone from contacting our players and enticing
them to do something they should not do.''
</P>
<P>
   Porter, a star forward at Auburn, was declared ineligible after
he admitted taking money from an agent's middleman, claiming it was
needed to keep his mother from being evicted.
</P>
<P>
   Porter's request for reinstatement was denied this week by the
NCAA, but the school is appealing in hopes of getting him back for
at least part of the postseason.
</P>
<P>
   Brady would prefer to avoid a similar fate with his team, which
won a share of the SEC title and will meet Vanderbilt today in the
second round of the conference tourney.
</P>
<P>
   When LSU (25-4) arrived at the Georgia Dome on Thursday to scout
Vandy's 76-53 victory over Mississippi State, the players were
accompanied by the Agent Police -- two campus officers and the
school's compliance officer, all dressed in plain clothes.
</P>
<P>
   Campus officer Richard Buckland, adorned in a white shirt, black
pants and a green jacket, sat right behind Swift, the SEC's
co-player of the year.
</P>
<P>
   ''They are just doing this because of the Chris Porter incident
and to make sure nothing happens,'' said Swift, who was wearing
Mardi Gras beads and cooling down with his frozen drink.
</P>
<P>
   Brady said he got the idea for extra security about a month ago
after hearing that Georgia coach Jim Harrick once employed an
officer to watch over his players on the road.
</P>
<P>
   When Porter was declared ineligible on Feb. 27 with three games
left in the regular season, Brady decided to act for the SEC and
NCAA tournaments.
</P>
<P>
   His methods were first reported Thursday by ESPN.com.
</P>
<P>
   ''When you have success at this level, you've got to have the
kind of players who draw attention,'' said Brady, whose team went
6-26 in the conference his first two seasons at LSU. ''I didn't
have this problem the last two years.''
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, most of their attention is focused on Swift and Smith.
</P>
<P>
   Swift, a 6-foot-9 sophomore forward, averaged 16.5 points --
third in the SEC -- and led the conference in shooting percentage
(.618) and blocked shots (2.86).
</P>
<P>
   The Louisiana native is the Tigers' most exciting player since
Shaquille O'Neal and a likely lottery selection if he decides to
turn pro. Swift's mother has told Brady her son plans to return for
his junior season.
</P>
<P>
   Smith, a 6-foot-11 senior center, averaged 12.5 points and 7.1
rebounds a game. A native of Atlanta, he attended Metropolitan
Junior College for two years before moving to LSU. He is expected
to be a first-round pick in the NBA.
</P>
<P>
   Swift is used to having Buckland nearby.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's usually at all the home games, but they decided to bring
him here to watch out for us, mainly me and Jabari,'' Swift said,
adding that Buckland doesn't follow him everywhere. ''Only where we
need him.''
</P>
<P>
   Buckland declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   The undercover officers are patroling the hallways of the team's
hotel, making sure the players stay away from agents or their
representatives. Brady already bars his players from accepting
phone calls in their rooms when on the road.
</P>
<P>
   The SEC sent an investigator to meet with Swift and Smith after
the Porter admission, but both players signed an affidavit that
they haven't received any money from an agent.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think you can prevent everything,'' Brady said. ''But
if we create enough of a deterrent, maybe we will avoid a
problem.''
</P>
<P>
   SEC commissioner Roy Kramer approved Brady's plan.
</P>
<P>
   ''Each school has to do what works for them,'' Kramer said.
''Certainly, LSU has taken a positive step.''
</P>
<P>
   But Alabama coach Mark Gottfried, who has several promising
young players on his roster, wouldn't commit to following Brady's
lead.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's an element of trust you have to have with your
players,'' Gottfried said. ''These are grown men and they have to
act like grown men.''

<HEADLINE> Calm winds Spur Low Scoring at Honda  </HEADLINE>
By MARK LONG, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   CORAL SPRINGS, Fla. (AP) -- It took Matt Gogel two months to
overcome his dramatic loss to Tiger Woods.
</P>
<P>
   Now that Gogel is back, it took him just one day to regain a
spot atop the leaderboard.
</P>
<P>
   Gogel shot a 7-under-par 65 Thursday in the opening round of the
Honda Classic. He is tied with Mike Brisky, Brian Gay, Dudley Hart,
J.P. Hayes, Brian Henninger, Skip Kendall and Paraguay's Carlos
Franco for the lead.
</P>
<P>
   This time, Gogel would like to stay there.
</P>
<P>
   ''So much goes with winning vs. second place,'' said Gogel, the
career leader in Nike Tour victories, but a rookie on the PGA Tour.
</P>
<P>
   Eight players shot 66 and were one stroke back, including Casey
Martin, the first player to use a cart on tour. Martin has a rare
circulatory condition in his right leg that makes it difficult for
him to walk 18 holes.
</P>
<P>
   ''That was about as pain-free a round as I've had in a long
time,'' said Martin, whose lawsuit against the PGA Tour was upheld
in appellate court this week. ''I played great, I really did. I
just hit a lot of fairways, a lot of greens and made some putts. It
was as solid a round as I've played in a long time.''
</P>
<P>
   Only 18 players of the 144-man field finished over par.
Forty-six players are within three shots of the lead -- and Gogel.
</P>
<P>
   Gogel, 28, was victimized by Woods' amazing final-round comeback
at Pebble Beach on Jan. 7. Woods was seven strokes back with seven
holes to play before rallying to beat Gogel for his sixth straight
tour win.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was somewhat nervous,'' Gogel said. ''I made a bogey and
then another bogey and I was stunned a little bit. I played a
little too conservative coming in and Tiger was chasing. He made a
lot of birdies.''
</P>
<P>
   Gogel was devastated.
</P>
<P>
   He tried to play the next week in the Buick Invitational, but
missed the cut. Determined not to let it faze him, he tested his
resilience again the following week at the Nissan Open. But he was
back home after two rounds for the second straight week.
</P>
<P>
   Gogel needed some time off.
</P>
<P>
   For two weeks, he didn't touch his clubs. He never took them out
of the travel bag. He tried not to even think about golf.
</P>
<P>
   ''It probably stung me a little bit more than I thought,'' Gogel
said.
</P>
<P>
   He spent two weeks at home in Kansas City, Kan., hanging out
with family and friends.
</P>
<P>
   He had fun for the first time since enjoying a seemingly safe,
five-stroke lead in the final round at Pebble Beach.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Gogel found his clubs right where he left them --
tucked away in a corner and ready to travel. The down time seems to
have made a big difference.
</P>
<P>
   Gogel made five birdies, holed a sand shot on the par-5 No. 16
for eagle and just missed another birdie Thursday that would have
given him a one-stroke lead.
</P>
<P>
   ''I feel like I can come in here on Monday and, in two or three
days, get my game ready,'' Gogel said. ''If I putt well, then I'm
going to play well.''
Divots: Defending champion Vijay Singh shot a 70 and is five back.
... Brisky made six birdies in a row, tying the course record set
by Fred Couples in 1985. ... Kendall was alone atop the leaderboard
at 8 under before missing a 4-foot putt for par on the 18th, the
fifth-toughest closing hole on tour last season. ... Australian
sensation Aaron Baddeley, 18, the only amateur in the field, shot a
3-under 69. The Australian Open winner would have had a lower
round, but was even on the four par-5s. ... Franco, the tour's 1999
rookie of the year, is playing with tendinitis in his left wrist.
... David Sutherland had a rare double-eagle on the par-5 No. 14.
After his drive, he hit a 3-wood from 274 yards that found the
hole. It was the first double-eagle on tour this season. There were
five last year.

<HEADLINE> Globetrotters Retire Chamberlain No.  </HEADLINE>
By BILL BERGSTROM, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Wilt Chamberlain was quick to capture the
public's imagination. The 7-foot-1 center from a powerhouse
Overbrook High team landed a big-money contract with the Harlem
Globetrotters and went on to an NBA career that rewrote the record
books.
</P>
<P>
   Chamberlain, who died Oct. 12, brought the crowd to its feet
again Thursday at Overbrook when he became the first player in the
74-year history of the Globetrotters to have his jersey retired.
</P>
<P>
   Chamberlain's number had already been retired by the Golden
State (formerly Philadelphia) Warriors, the Philadelphia 76ers,
with whom he won an NBA championship in 1967, and the Los Angeles
Lakers, who won the title with Chamberlain in 1972.
</P>
<P>
   At his old high school, West Philadelphia youths piled out of
the bleachers and crowded around present and former Globetrotters
to get their school notebooks autographed. High school teammate
Vince Miller said Chamberlain would have loved it.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't know which one he loved more, Overbrook High School or
the Harlem Globetrotters. Those were the two first loves of his
life, the Globies and Overbrook,'' Miller said.
</P>
<P>
   ''He put us on the map,'' said freshman Andre Taylor, 14.
Chamberlain often wore the Overbrook jacket after he became famous.
</P>
<P>
   Miller pulled out a 41-year-old news release about Chamberlain's
$65,000 contract with the Globetrotters. ''Guys in the NBA weren't
making more than $12,000 or $15,000 a year then, and that was a
lot,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Present-day Globetrotters Geese Ausbie, ''Sweet'' Lou Dunbar and
Orlando Antigua arrived at the school, unfolding themselves from a
minivan, to take part in the ceremony, sign autographs and show off
some trademark ballhandling magic.
</P>
<P>
   ''I can do that,'' 15-year-old freshman Maurice Todd said as
they spun basketballs on their fingertips. The Globetrotters play
Saturday at the First Union Center, with 50 free tickets going to
Overbrook students.
</P>
<P>
   The players unveiled a showcase at center court displaying two
of Chamberlain's bright blue No. 13 jerseys with red and white
striped shorts. It will stay at the school as a tribute, former
teammate Tex Harrison said, ''to one of the greatest Harlem
Globetrotters of all time.''
</P>
<P>
   Harrison remembered Chamberlain as a good friend who always had
a hand in endless games of bid whist, a card game similar to
bridge, played in the team bus and locker room. ''When we weren't
talking about basketball we were playing cards,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Miller was a forward on the Overbrook teams Chamberlain led from
1952-55.
</P>
<P>
   ''We won three public school championships and two all-city
championships and we lost a total of three games in three years,''
he said. ''Two or three.''
</P>
<P>
   Chamberlain left for the University of Kansas and the
Globetrotters before playing 14 NBA seasons with the Warriors,
76ers and Lakers, scoring 31,419 points in his career. Overbrook
students were well aware of his records that still stand: highest
season scoring average (50 in 1962) and most points scored in a
game (100 against the New York Knicks on March 2, 1962).
</P>
<P>
   ''Nobody's going to break 100 points,'' said Todd, eager to try
out for the Overbrook Panthers as a shooting guard next year.
''Until I get there,'' he quickly added. ''Records are made to be
broken, right?''
</P>
<P>
   ''He's tough. A lot of people talk about Wilt Chamberlain on the
girls' team. He's like our role model, too,'' said Patricia
Whittingham, a 16-year-old junior guard.

<HEADLINE> Browns' Top Pick Spurs Rumors  </HEADLINE>
By TOM WITHERS, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND (AP) -- Bill Parcells phoned the Browns. Nothing new,
the man who runs the New York Jets apparently said. Just wanted to
say ''Hello.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Coach Parcells, I think was testing the waters a little bit,''
said Dwight Clark, Cleveland's director of football operations, who
like everyone else forgets Al Groh is now the Jets' coach.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, the waters in Cleveland are churning. The Browns hold
the No. 1 pick in next month's NFL draft and there is speculation
Parcells has his eye on getting it.
</P>
<P>
   Parcells has been shopping wide receiver Keyshawn Johnson and if
he's able to get the right deal, he might come calling on the
Browns again. He may offer three first-round picks so he could use
the No. 1 to pick for one of Penn State's defensive stars,
linebacker LaVar Arrington or defensive end Courtney Brown.
</P>
<P>
   The Browns, though, aren't sure they want to pass on Arrington,
Brown or Florida State wide receiver Peter Warrick. Clark calls
them ''Hall of Fame players.''
</P>
<P>
   But Clark knows that if the Jets, who already own the Nos. 16
and 18 picks, package another high one in a deal, the Browns would
have to think seriously about trading the top pick.
</P>
<P>
   ''I still think we'll keep the pick,'' Clark said. ''But if
there's an unbelievable deal that comes across, then we'll have to
take a look at it.''
</P>
<P>
   Clark, like many of the NFL folks who were at the scouting
combines in Indianapolis, has fallen in love with Arrington and
Brown.
</P>
<P>
   And suddenly, Warrick, who was the frontrunner, is in a
three-way race.
</P>
<P>
   ''For a long time it was Peter, Peter, Peter,'' Clark said
Thursday. ''Now, it's 'Maybe we should look at these other two
guys, they're pretty damn good.' They are just unbelievable
specimens. It's like somebody chiseled them out of granite.''
</P>
<P>
   Arrington and Brown have become hot properties -- not just with
the Browns, but all over the NFL as teams begin plotting their
strategies for the April 15 draft.
</P>
<P>
   Clark said Browns coach Chris Palmer has spoken to Parcells, but
no trade was discussed.
</P>
<P>
   The Browns, coming off a disappointing 2-14 expansion season,
need too much help to turn down a bevy of picks like the ones being
rumored. Clark said he left the combines thinking Cleveland would
keep the No. 1 pick for the second straight year.
</P>
<P>
   ''I did until all the rumors about three first-round picks
started,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Clark said he is also leery of trying to figure out what
Parcells might be doing.
</P>
<P>
   ''Coach Parcells is very sly. And he plays this cat-and-mouse
game better than anybody. So if he's saying Courtney Brown, you
really have no idea. He could be saying Courtney Brown to throw
everybody off or it could be true.
</P>
<P>
   ''Who knows? I personally think he wants LaVar Arrington,
because LaVar Arrington is Lawrence Taylor.''
</P>
<P>
   After watching game films, Clark now understands why Parcells
might covet either Arrington, a do-it-all linebacker, or Brown, a
defensive end compared to Bruce Smith.
</P>
<P>
   Like Taylor, Arrington is a playmaker. Clark has seen the
linebacker hurdle defenders for sacks. He's seen Arrington run down
halfbacks from behind, and he's seen him dive over center to block
a field goal attempt.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's the kind of guy that no matter who you are watching, No.
11 is in all the films,'' Clark said. ''He's everywhere. He makes
all the tackles.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Arrington and Brown will hold personal workouts next
Wednesday in State College, Pa.
</P>
<P>
   Complicating matters for the Browns is that Warrick will hold
his workout the same day in Tallahassee, Fla. However, Clark said
it's likely both he and Palmer will attend the Penn State workout.
</P>
<P>
   Warrick was in town last week to visit the Browns, and Clark
said the organization was impressed with the wide receiver.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's a great kid and he handled himself very well,'' Clark
said. ''We know about him. I think we all have a very good feel for
Peter. We'll all go to Penn State so we can get a better feel for
the other two guys.''

<HEADLINE> Racing Roundup  </HEADLINE>
By RICHARD ROSENBLATT, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   Everywhere you turn this weekend, Hall of Fame trainer D. Wayne
Lukas has a 3-year-old in a Kentucky Derby prep race.
</P>
<P>
   Look to Gulfstream Park on Saturday, and there's favored High
Yield in the Florida Derby and long shot Sun Cat in the Swale
Stakes. At the Fair Grounds in New Orleans, there's Exchange Rate
in the Sunday's Louisiana Derby. November Slew and Shawnee Country
are in Saturday's Fair Grounds Oaks.
</P>
<P>
   Check out California, and Lukas sends his sensational filly
Surfside in Sunday's Santa Anita Oaks and True Confidence in
Saturday's El Camino Derby at Bay Meadows.
</P>
<P>
   Lukas, though, can't be everywhere, so he plans to watch High
Yield in the Florida Derby, then fly to California to saddle
Surfside on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   And when the weekend is over, Lukas just might have a better
feel for who will come along with him to the Kentucky Derby.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a little too early to see where this will lead us,''
Lukas cautions. ''We'll just race and see where it takes us.''
</P>
<P>
   The Lukas entourage will be challenged by a pair of two-time
Kentucky Derby-winning trainers, Bob Baffert and Nick Zito. With
Lukas' four Derby wins -- three in the 1990s -- the three trainers
have combined to win the last six Derbys and seven of the last
nine.
</P>
<P>
   Zito's Bare Outline, a late replacement for the injured
Greenwood Lake, challenges 8-5 favorite High Yield in the Florida
Derby. Bare Outline, winner of the Unbridled Stakes on the same day
High Yield won the Fountain of Youth, is the 8-1 fifth choice.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're ready to see what happens,'' Zito said. ''Greenwood Lake
was our marquee guy, but Bare Outline is a pretty good colt, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Baffert takes on Lukas's Exchange Rate in the Louisiana Derby,
with expected favorite Captain Steve and Tribunal in what is
shaping up as the weekend's strongest field. Others set to compete
are More Than Ready, Mighty and Country Only.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is probably a more balanced race than the Florida
Derby,'' Lukas said. ''We're just looking to improve off his last
race.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Fair Grounds Oaks, Baffert sends out favored Chilukki
against Lukas fillies November Slew and Shawnee Country.
</P>
<P>
   ''After this weekend, we'll all know a little more about our
horses,'' Zito said.
</P>
<P>
   Among the top Derby contenders not racing are Anees, The Deputy
and War Chant.
</P>
<P>
   Anees, winner of the Breeders' Cup Juvenile, and The Deputy are
expected to meet in the San Felipe at Santa Anita on March 19; and
War Chant, the San Rafael winner, goes next in the Santa Anita
Derby on April 8.
</P>
<P>
   In the Florida Derby, High Yield is shooting for his fourth win
in 11 careers starts. The Storm Cat colt has been out of the money
only once in 10 starts.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's nice to be the favorite, but we certainly don't think the
race is a slam dunk,'' said Barry Knight, Lukas' assistant trainer.
</P>
<P>
   Hal's Hope and Elite Mercedes, 2-3 in the Fountain of Youth on
Feb. 19, will be back to challenge High Yield.
</P>
<P>
   In the Louisiana Derby, Captain Steve is coming off a
third-place finish in the Santa Catalina on Jan. 30 in his only
other race as a 3-year-old. Owned by Mike Pegram, Captain Steve has
won four of nine career starts. Tribunal has a win and two seconds
in four lifetime starts.
</P>
<P>
   Exchange Rate is coming off a 1\-length win in the Risen Star on
Feb. 20.
</P>
<P>
   Lukas also has high hopes for True Confidence in the El Camino.
Last year, Charismatic finished second in the race and went on to
win the Kentucky Derby and Preakness.

<HEADLINE> House Boosts Minimum Wage by $1  </HEADLINE>
By CURT ANDERSON, AP Tax Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Now that the House has passed a $1 increase in
the minimum wage over two years combined with $122 billion in
business tax cuts, negotiators will have to sort things out with
the Senate's $1 wage boost over three years and different tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton, meanwhile, says he'll veto any minimum wage
bill if it includes a large tax relief package that uses too much
of the projected federal budget surplus.
</P>
<P>
   Even though most Democrats support raising the $5.15-an-hour
wage to $6.15 over two years, the president immediately denounced
the legislation passed Thursday night by the House because of the
''risky tax giveaways'' he contends would jeopardize Social
Security and Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   ''Once again, Republicans in the House of Representatives have
demonstrated that they would rather fight for special interests
than give working families the raise they deserve,'' Clinton said
in a written statement. ''Congress should send me a bill I can
sign: a clean, straightforward bill that raises the minimum wage by
a dollar over two years.''
</P>
<P>
   The House voted 246-179 for a bipartisan amendment boosting the
wage by $1 over two years -- a $2,000 raise for a full-time worker --
instead of a GOP plan for the same raise over three years. The
rewritten bill then passed 282-143.
</P>
<P>
   ''Three years is simply too long to phase in a minimum wage
increase,'' said Rep. Jim Traficant, D-Ohio, a main sponsor. ''An
increase of $1 over two years will have an immediate positive
impact on thousands of families.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, the House voted 257-169 for the GOP tax bill that
Clinton opposes, two-thirds of it cuts in estate taxes. Republican
leaders then combined the tax and wage measures into one bill.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate has passed a three-year, $1 increase in the minimum
wage and its own tax package as part of a bill to make it harder
for people to escape credit card and other debts in bankruptcy
court. Differences in the Senate and House measures will have to be
worked out before a bill is sent to Clinton, but many lawmakers
were optimistic for compromise before Congress adjourns for the
fall elections.
</P>
<P>
   ''It will pass. They're not going to leave here without a
minimum wage bill,'' said House Minority Whip David Bonior, D-Mich.
</P>
<P>
   Although a majority of Republicans oppose raising the minimum
wage, GOP leaders wanted to give Northeastern Republican moderates
an opportunity to vote for an increase and deny the Democrats their
own bill. The GOP hoped the vote would defuse the issue in the
November congressional elections.
</P>
<P>
   Many Democrats said the increase was long past due, asserting
that average pay for corporate chief executive officers has risen
some 750 percent since 1980, compared with only 68 percent for the
average worker. About 4 million workers are paid the minimum wage.
</P>
<P>
   The House measure calls for a 50-cent increase in the minimum
wage in April of this year, followed by another 50 cents in April
2001. It is unlikely, however, that the legislation will become law
by April and there has been no talk of making it retroactive.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate bill would increase the wage by 35 cents this year,
by 35 cents more in March 2001 and 30 cents in March 2002. The
Senate tax package totals $103 billion over 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   Although Democrats claim the House tax bill favors the wealthy,
Republicans contended it would properly offset the costs to
business of raising the minimum wage, which many in the GOP view as
a job-killer and hindrance to new investment or expansion.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our point is simply, let's find some tax relief to cushion the
blow,'' said Rep. Rob Portman, R-Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the debate centered on the estate tax cuts. Costing
$78.6 billion over 10 years, they were portrayed by Democrats as a
giveaway primarily for people with incomes over $319,000 a year.
Democrats were prevented from offering their own, smaller tax
package for small business.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're not fighting any tax relief. We're fighting for the
right kind of tax relief,'' said Rep. Sander Levin, D-Mich.
</P>
<P>
   GOP sponsors said current estate taxes prevent small businesses
and family farms from being passed down to heirs and require costly
tax planning simply to ease the impact.
</P>
<P>
   ''The real issue is, who are the heirs?'' said House Ways and
Means Committee Chairman Bill Archer, R-Texas. The tax cut, he
added, ''is not going to benefit the people who died.''
</P>
<P>
   The House tax package also would gradually boost 401(k)
contribution limits and make other pension changes; make health
insurance premiums fully tax deductible for the self-employed
sooner than under current law; increase the amount of business
meals that can be deducted; and enact other tax breaks for small
business.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate version contains many tax breaks in similar areas,
but it does not include any cuts in the estate tax.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   The House bill is H.R. 3081.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate bill is H.R. 833.

<HEADLINE> Tokyo Stocks Close Higher  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO (AP) -- The dollar edged lower against the yen Friday on
selling by foreign investors. Japan's benchmark stock index rose,
bolstered by sharp gains on Wall Street overnight.
</P>
<P>
   The dollar was trading at 106.36 yen on the Tokyo foreign
exchange market, down 0.30 yen from late Thursday in Tokyo and
below its late New York level of 106.46 yen overnight.
</P>
<P>
   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average rose 88.07 points,
or 0.45 percent, to close at 19,750.40. On Thursday, the average
closed down 104.47 points, or 0.53 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The dollar dipped on foreign selling, but its fall was limited
by continued concern that Japan's central bank might intervene to
stem the yen's rise.
</P>
<P>
   A strong yen could hurt the nascent economic recovery by making
Japanese exports more expensive abroad, and cutting into earnings
of exporters.
</P>
<P>
   The Bank of Japan sold about $1 billion of yen in Tokyo on
Wednesday, the second such action since Jan. 4, in an attempt to
halt the yen's rapid advance against the dollar.
</P>
<P>
   Trades remained in a narrow range as Haruhiko Kuroda, vice
finance minister for international affairs, confirmed Japan's
currency stance Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are ready to take action as needed,'' Kuroda said.
</P>
<P>
   In other currencies, the euro was traded at 102.98 yen, up from
102.89 yen late Thursday in Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   On the stock market, prices started higher Friday thanks to
strong gains on Wall Street, where the technology-rich Nasdaq
composite index rose 149.60 to close at 5,046.86, topping its
previous record close of 4,914.79, set March 3.
</P>
<P>
   Also in New York, the Dow Jones industrial average rose 154.20
to 10,010.73 at Thursday's finish.
</P>
<P>
   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section closed down 10.47 points, or 0.64 percent, to
1,633.30. The TOPIX closed down 17.37 points, or 1.05 percent, the
day before.
</P>
<P>
   The yield on the benchmark 10-year Japanese government bond rose
to 1.8200 percent from Thursday's finish of 1.7850 percent. Its
price fell 0.29 points to 99.83.

<HEADLINE> Tiffany expert sentenced to more than two years in prison  </HEADLINE>
By LARRY NEUMEISTER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Alastair Duncan says more than two years in
prison for selling stained glass windows stolen from a graveyard
will destroy his career as the world's foremost expert on Tiffany
windows, though his sentencing judge disagrees.
</P>
<P>
   ''The law has no intention of destroying somebody,'' U.S.
District Judge Thomas P. Griesa said Thursday as he handed down the
2-year, 3-month sentence.
</P>
<P>
   Griesa said that he had once sentenced a prominent art dealer to
prison only to see him re-emerge and succeed in his old livelihood.
</P>
<P>
   But the author of 27 books said his business was ruined, his
family shattered and his earnings potential destroyed. ''My life
and 25-year professional career are over.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I've been shunned by my neighbors and art associates,'' Duncan
told Griesa, pleading for a lesser sentence as his voice broke from
emotion.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've paid a horrible, horrible price,'' Duncan said. ''I will
certainly die spiritually if incarcerated, as will my children.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides the jail term, Griesa also ordered restitution of
$220,000 -- the value of a 9-foot-tall, 5-foot-wide Tiffany window
stolen in 1993 from the Salem Fields cemetery on the
Brooklyn-Queens border.
</P>
<P>
   The judge said he had great sympathy for Duncan and his family,
which includes a son with a learning disability, but believed the
sentence was not excessive.
</P>
<P>
   The judge said the prison term was warranted because Duncan was
convicted Aug. 13 by a jury of a ''substantial and serious course
of criminal conduct.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that when Duncan resold the window taken from the Salem
Fields cemetery, he knew it had been stolen. Griesa said Duncan
then arranged with the graveyard robber to steal other glass
created by the late Louis Comfort Tiffany.
</P>
<P>
   The graveyard robber, Anthony Casamassina, had testified that he
often broke into cemeteries and mausoleums, snatching 20 to 30
stained glass windows and several vases, statues and pedestals
since the middle 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   At trial, Casamassina said he had used one of Duncan's books to
learn about Tiffany glass and which cemeteries held some of the
better works.
</P>
<P>
   At one point during sentencing, Griesa said Duncan must have
known he was arranging to recover glass from cemeteries. As he
spoke, Duncan shook his head vigorously.
</P>
<P>
   Duncan was permitted to remain free on bail until a date could
be set for surrender and possibly as he appealed his conviction for
conspiring to export stolen property, exporting stolen property,
structuring a currency transaction and witness tampering.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, U.S. Attorney Mary Jo White said the sentence
was ''appropriate punishment for this desecration.''
</P>
<P>
   She said the sentence ''sends a message to the art world that no
one can profit from trafficking in stolen art or graveyard booty
and expect to get away with it.''

<HEADLINE> Rose, 88, Has Hot Fla. Derby Horse  </HEADLINE>
By RICHARD ROSENBLATT, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   HALLANDALE BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- Harold Rose may have picked the
right horse to name after himself.
</P>
<P>
   With a solid showing in Saturday's $750,000 Florida Derby, Hal's
Hope will keep his 88-year-old trainer, owner and breeder on the
road to the Kentucky Derby.
</P>
<P>
   ''I thought he was something special when I first saw him as a
yearling,'' Rose said of the 3-year-old colt, who enters the 1
1-8-mile race at Gulfstream Park as the co-third choice behind 8-5
favorite High Yield.
</P>
<P>
   Rose, who had a stroke and underwent a quadruple bypass last
year, still shows up at his barn at Calder Race Course in Miami
every morning. And he's counting on Hal's Hope to give him the
biggest win of his training career, which began in the late 1960s
after he retired from working in the printing and publishing
business.
</P>
<P>
   When Hal's Hope won the Holy Bull Stakes at Gulfstream by 5\
lengths on January 15, he was sent off as a 40-1 long shot. ''I
don't know why he was that big a price,'' Rose said, adding he made
a little ''but not enough'' money on the race. ''He didn't surprise
me. Not at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Hal's Hope, with Roger Velez aboard, followed that effort with a
second-place finish behind High Yield in the Fountain of Youth on
Feb. 19. He was 3\ lengths behind the winner, even though Rose said
the colt bled internally near the end of the race.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, Hal's Hope, a winner in three of seven career
starts, will race for the first time on the diuretic Lasix.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's right there on top of the best horses I've ever
trained,'' Rose said. ''He's ready.''
</P>
<P>
   And so is Rose, who has been waiting a long time to win a big
race. In his 30 years in racing, his claim to fame was Rexson's
Hope, who made it to the Kentucky Derby in 1984, but finished 10th.
There was also Mia's Hope, the dam of Hal's Hope. She won the 1995
Bonnie Miss Stakes, the top race for females at Gulfstream.
</P>
<P>
   Asked why it took him so long to name a horse for himself, Rose
said, ''Because I was waiting for a good one.''
</P>
<P>
   High Yield, ridden by Pat Day, gives Hall of Fame trainer D.
Wayne Lukas yet another promising Triple Crown prospect. Last year,
Lukas trained Derby and Preakness winner Charismatic.
</P>
<P>
   The Storm Cat colt has three wins and has been out of the money
only once in 10 starts. High Yield is owned by Bob and Beverly
Lewis, Susan Magnier and Michael Tabor.
</P>
<P>
   ''The horse has done tremendous since his last race,'' Barry
Knight, Lukas' assistant trainer, said. ''His health is excellent
and his attitude great. He hasn't missed a day of training, and
that's all you can ask for.''
</P>
<P>
   Hal's Hope and Elite Mercedes, 2-3 in the Fountain of Youth,
could pose serious challenges, too.
</P>
<P>
   Elite Mercedes, trained by Elliott Walden, is the second choice
at 4-1 off his last race. Walden is quite satisfied with the way
the son of Mercedes Won has trained for the race.
</P>
<P>
   ''Everything has gone extremely well since we purchased him in
November,'' Walden said. ''He ran well in the Fountain of Youth,
according to plan. Now we just have to get the victory. We're
banking on the fact he's the only one coming back in the Florida
Derby after making his first start of the year.''
</P>
<P>
   Scottish Halo, a New York-bred trained by Paul Rizzo and ridden
by Jorge Chavez, Gulfstream's leading rider, is the co-third choice
at 6-1 with Hal's Hope.
</P>
<P>
   Others in the 10-horse field are Bare Outline (8-1), Tahkodha
Hills (10-1), Hades (12-1), Postponed (15-1), and Settlement and
Deputy Warlock (each 20-1). The winner earns $450,000.
</P>
<P>
   In Saturday's seven-furlong Swale Stakes for 3-year-olds, Trippi
is the 8-5 favorite with Ultimate Warrior the second choice at 3-1
in a field of eight.

House Boosts Minimum Wage by $1
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Now that the House has passed a $1 increase in the minimum
wage over two years combined with $122 billion in business tax cuts, negotiators
will have to sort things out with the Senate's $1 wage boost over three years
and different tax cuts. President Clinton, meanwhile, says he'll veto any
minimum wage bill if it includes a large tax relief package that uses too much
of the projected federal budget surplus. Even though most Democrats support
raising the $5.15-an-hour wage to $6.15 over two years, the president
immediately denounced the legislation passed Thursday night by the House because
of the ''risky tax giveaways'' he contends would jeopardize Social Security and
Medicare.

McCain Suspends Presidential Run
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   SEDONA, Ariz. (AP) -- John McCain is taking a week for ''travel and
reflection'' and aides say the onus is now on George W. Bush to begin building
bridges to those who rallied around McCain. There was ample evidence that the
bridge-building process was underway. ''The party needs John McCain to broaden
its base, and it's only by broadening its base is the party going to win,''
McCain campaign manager Rick Davis said Thursday. On Capitol Hill and in a
''very polite'' telephone call Bush placed to McCain after he announced he was
halting his campaign, there were signs that Bush was looking for ways to heal
the wounds of a rancorous primary campaign where McCain mounted a surprisingly
strong challenge.

Chinese Pledge To Fight Corruption
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   BEIJING (AP) -- China's top law enforcers pledged fresh efforts Friday to
battle corruption, telling the legislature that lawbreakers will be severely
punished ''no matter who they are.'' Both Xiao Yang, China's top judge, and Han
Zhubin, the top prosecutor, cited Wednesday's execution of a corrupt deputy
provincial governor in telling legislators of their resolve to step up efforts
against graft, bribery and embezzlement. Xiao announced a two-year initiative to
clean up and improve county-level courts, and Han pledged a thorough
investigation of government officials implicated in major smuggling scandals.

   BEIRA, Mozambique (AP) -- Rain paralyzed aid deliveries to hundreds of
thousands of flood victims in southern Mozambique while the U.S. military
delivered thousands of pounds of rice to hungry people in ravaged central
regions. More rain was forecast for Friday, but military helicopter pilots from
Spain, Britain and other countries planned to try once again to deliver food,
medical supplies and other aid to the flooded Limpopo River valley. U.N. World
Food Program spokeswoman Lindsey Davis said food stored in aid camps would run
out in a day or two unless the flood victims received new supplies.

19 Perish in South Pacific Fire
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   SUVA, Fiji (AP) -- Eighteen teen-age girls and their supervisor were killed
Thursday when a fire tore through a locked dormitory at a high school in the
South Pacific nation of Tuvalu, a government spokesman said. The fire was
believed to have been caused by a student's candle that toppled over in the
girls' dormitory at the Motufoua Secondary School. The dorm was an old wooden
building whose door had been fastened shut and whose open windows were covered
in wire mesh. The girls, ranging between 14 and 17 years old, were locked inside
their rooms when the fire broke out, Radio Tuvalu reporter Diana Semi told
Australia's National Nine News.

Marino's agent, told ESPN.com that Marino had yet to decide whether he would
retire or stay in football, perhaps by accepting an offer from the Minnesota
Vikings. Dolphins president Eddie Jones said the reports that Marino had decided
to retire were news to him.

<HEADLINE> CIA: China's Spying Has Increased  </HEADLINE>
By TOM RAUM, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Despite its repeated denials of espionage,
China's spying on the United States actually has increased over the
past decade along with its efforts to influence U.S. policy, a
report by the CIA and FBI contends.
</P>
<P>
   Gathering military, economic and political intelligence in the
United States remains a key priority for the Chinese government's
intelligence apparatus, according to the unclassified report to
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, China relies on many sources for its intelligence,
including Chinese scientists who visit the United States, college
students and even tourists, said the report, sent to Congress in
December but made public Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ''Chinese attempts to obtain U.S. military and military-related
technology -- reflecting recognition of the overwhelming
technological superiority enjoyed by the Western Alliance in the
Gulf War and Kosovo -- have increased since the early 1990s,'' the
report concluded.
</P>
<P>
   The report was released as Congress considers President
Clinton's request, made earlier this week, to give China permanent
access to U.S. markets as a prelude to its membership in the World
Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
   A congressional report in the spring of 1999 said there was
widespread Chinese espionage at U.S. nuclear laboratories and
suggested that China had benefited militarily from U.S. satellite
sales and other technology transfers.
</P>
<P>
   China has denied such spying.
</P>
<P>
   Wen Ho Lee, a former government scientist at the Los Alamos
National Laboratory in New Mexico, has been charged with 59 counts
alleging he breached security by downloading U.S. nuclear weapons
secrets to unsecured computers.
</P>
<P>
   The five-page joint CIA-FBI report said Chinese espionage
against the United States is broadly based.
</P>
<P>
   ''Penetrating the U.S. intelligence community is a key objective
of the Chinese,'' it said.
</P>
<P>
   China relies heavily on ''a network of nonprofessional
individuals and organizations,'' it said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Chinese intelligence services have a long history of using
Chinese students studying abroad to collect information, either
formally for those services or informally for their home-based
research institutes or universities,'' the report said. ''Many
Chinese students in U.S. graduate schools are studying hard
sciences and are able to collect a wide variety of information that
is of value to China's efforts to ascend the technology ladder.''
</P>
<P>
   The report said intelligence on military matters is primarily
gathered by military attaches assigned to the Chinese Embassy in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   While most of this intelligence-gathering is from Western
publications and other publicly available materials, since 1987 the
FBI and the Customs Service ''have detected and interdicted at
least two ... clandestine collection operations in the United
States'' conducted by the military intelligence department of the
People's Liberation Army General Staff.
</P>
<P>
   The report said China also puts heavy emphasis on economic
espionage, including trying to coax information from American
business executives traveling in China, particularly those of
Chinese ancestry.
</P>
<P>
   China also continues to try to build political influence within
the United States -- including in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ''Much like the rest of the world, the Chinese government
continues to seek influence in Congress through various means,
including inviting congressional members to visit (China), lobbying
ethnic Chinese voters and prominent U.S. citizens and engaging U.S.
business interests,'' the report said.
</P>
<P>
   In a cover letter to House Speaker Dennis Hastert, CIA Director
George Tenet and FBI Director Louis Freeh said the report was being
submitted because it was requested by Congress in legislation
passed in 1998. A classified version of the report was sent to the
House and Senate intelligence committees, they noted.
</P>
<P>
   Both Tenet and Free briefed congressional intelligence panels
earlier in the week on the threat from alleged Chinese espionage.

<HEADLINE> Tuvalu School Fire Kills 19  </HEADLINE>
By ROBERT KEITH-REID, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SUVA, Fiji (AP) -- Trapped by a bolted door and mesh-covered
windows, 18 teen-age girls and their supervisor died when a fire
swept through a high school dormitory in the South Pacific nation
of Tuvalu, officials said today.
</P>
<P>
   The fire broke out Thursday night in the Toalipi Girls dormitory
at the Motufoua Secondary School, the tiny island nation's largest
school with about 300 students, both boys and girls.
</P>
<P>
   The fire was believed to have been caused by a student's candle
that sparked an inferno in the girls' sleeping quarters -- a very
old wooden building. Its single door had been fastened shut and its
open windows were covered with wire mesh.
</P>
<P>
   The dorm supervisor died trying to rescue the girls, aged 14 to
17, Radio Tuvalu reporter Diana Semi told Australia's National Nine
News.
</P>
<P>
   ''The girls were in the dormitory, were trying to escape from
the fire but could not because all the doors were locked,'' Semi
said.
</P>
<P>
   A government spokesman told Australian Broadcasting Corp. Radio
that 18 girls had escaped the flames by smashing down a door.
</P>
<P>
   The government said it was starting an investigation into the
blaze.
</P>
<P>
   Tuvalu Prime Minister Ionatana Ionatana announced the tragedy
today in an address on Radio Tuvalu and offered his condolences to
the nation.
</P>
<P>
   He then set off for the six-hour boat trip to the remote coral
atoll of Vaitupu to assess the damage and attend a mass burial of
the victims.
</P>
<P>
   People are generally buried within 12 hours of dying in many
areas of the South Pacific, where there are high temperatures and
little refrigeration.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the prime minister's office also said the bodies
were burned beyond recognition and could not be returned to the
girls' parents.
</P>
<P>
   Tuvalu, formerly known as the Ellice Islands, is a nation of
9,500 people on nine coral atolls with a total area of just 10
square miles. It is 620 miles north of Fiji.
</P>
<P>
   The islands achieved independence from Britain in 1978.

<HEADLINE> Report: Schools Construction Climbs  </HEADLINE>
By ANJETTA McQUEEN, AP Education Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- While the Clinton administration has made
fixing the worst schoolhouses a top goal, much of the money over
the past decade for school construction paid for new buildings and
additions.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, school construction spending increased 39 percent from
1990 to 1997, a congressional report found. By 1997, states and
local school districts spent $25 billion, up from nearly $18
billion in 1990, said the report by the General Accounting Office,
which audits federal spending for Congress.
</P>
<P>
   During those eight years, enrollment rose 12 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Education Department officials argue that construction increases
still fell far short of the amount needed to accommodate nearly 50
million children in public schools today.
</P>
<P>
   Just five years ago, the GAO said it would cost $112 billion to
fix 25,000 buildings -- a third of the public inventory -- that
needed extensive repair or replacement.
</P>
<P>
   Even the 39 percent increase in spending on building ''could
hardly be considered enough to accommodate a 12 percent enrollment
growth rate,'' Michael Cohen, assistant education secretary, said
in a written response. ''The 39 percent increase includes prior
unmet needs.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, tried Thursday to increase money for
that need in renewing the Elementary and Secondary Education Act,
which covers most federal spending for school programs. Republicans
on the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee
rejected Harkin's proposal to add $1.7 billion to the legislation
before it goes before the full Senate for approval.
</P>
<P>
   ''The nicest places our children see are theaters and shopping
malls and the worst things they see are public schools; what does
that say to them?'' Harkin said.
</P>
<P>
   Local school districts provided the main source of the school
building money, which was more likely to pay for new buildings or
additions rather than repairs and renovations.
</P>
<P>
   Over the eight years, $58.2 billion was spent on new buildings,
compared with $45 billion for additions and $21.3 billion for
renovations.
</P>
<P>
   The federal government has offered indirect support -- tax
incentives comparable to those available for roads, parks and
hospitals, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   Many states help local districts with school building costs, but
15 states provided little or no funding for school buildings in the
1998-99 school year, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our only point is that school construction expenditures
increased much faster than enrollment during the period,'' said
Barbara D. Bovbjerg, a GAO researcher said. ''We do not know
whether the increase in construction expenditures was sufficient to
meet construction needs.''
</P>
<P>
   The average spent in the states came to about $473 per student
over the eight years measured by the report.
</P>
<P>
   But spending varied widely from state to state. In Nevada -- a
state with the highest growth in school enrollments -- construction
spending topped at $934 per child. That was 25 times more than the
state with the least amount of spending, Connecticut at $37 per
child, the report said.

<HEADLINE> Senate OKs $20B Education Package  </HEADLINE>
By ANJETTA McQUEEN, AP Education Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A $20 billion education package approved by a
Senate committee dilutes President Clinton's plan for hiring
100,000 new teachers and other specific help for poor
schoolchildren, say Democrats who vow to fight to keep the programs
in current education law.
</P>
<P>
   ''I will certainly recommend that the president veto this
unfocused and undemanding piece of legislation,'' Education
Secretary Richard Riley said Thursday, after the Senate Health,
Education, Labor and Pensions Committee approved the bill 10-8.
</P>
<P>
   Four days of sometimes impassioned debate has set the stage for
even more intense bickering once the full Senate considers the
renewal of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. The
34-year-old law provides books, teachers, computers and other help
to mainly poor and otherwise disadvantaged children.
</P>
<P>
   The bill renews most federal spending on schools but would also
give poor parents and local school districts more say over how
those dollars are spent on their children.
</P>
<P>
   The committee rejected Democrat proposals to dedicate funds to
hire new teachers to reduce class size in public elementary
schools, fix crumbling buildings, buy updated books for school
libraries, and keep states from waiving federal regulations that
target programs for homeless, migrant, immigrant children.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, they passed changes to the law that included allowing a
small group of yet-to-be decided states to take federal funds now
reserved for reducing class sizes and other programs and use them
for those of their own choosing. The law as put before the full
Senate would also let all 50 states have some limited freedom from
federal rules on education spending.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Republicans showed their true colors by turning a bad
education bill into an even worse right-wing bill,'' said Sen. Ted
Kennedy, D-Mass., the top Democrat on the GOP-led committee.
Kennedy promised to fight harder for the lost programs in general
Senate consideration and give Clinton a bill to sign that would
include the president's prized class-size reduction plan.
</P>
<P>
   Republican leaders, who have long argued the federal government
interferes too often with local schools, remained unfazed by the
threat.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's good policy,'' said Sen. Judd Gregg, R-N.H., a committee
member who argued that current law has only produced three decades
of failure and that states could use the flexibility to tailor
federal programs to their needs. ''This bill is a step in the right
direction.''
</P>
<P>
   Such change, Gregg said, includes allowing poor parents with
children in low-performing schools to use federal money for
tutoring, bus transfers to a better public school or private school
vouchers.
</P>
<P>
   That plan -- which closely mirrors one offered by GOP
presidential candidate George W. Bush -- could complicate any
congressional compromise since each party is looking for a
political advantage going into the fall elections. Voter polls show
education is a top concern.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton already has registered his displeasure with House
lawmakers, who have passed portions of the comprehensive law that
also dilute the class-size reduction program and free states from
many federal regulations.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate panel's chairman, Sen. Jim Jeffords, R-Vt., said
there was room to work on a bill that would support the president's
priorities without wresting local control from school districts. In
committee, Jeffords declined to vote for some of the
more-conservative provisions -- but he also did not actively oppose
them.
</P>
<P>
   ''I do know there are areas where we can make it more palatable
to the administration,'' said Jeffords, who did not get into
specifics.

<HEADLINE> Teen Seeks Lighter Jail Sentence  </HEADLINE>
By KELLEY SHANNON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO (AP) -- Tony Limon was a starter for South San
Antonio High School's basketball team last year, a star player
later voted ''Most Popular'' by his classmates at graduation.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the 18-year-old is in the Bexar County Jail, hoping a
five-year sentence imposed for breaking an opponent's nose during a
game will be reduced. It's a case that has brought national
attention to a young man who was already in trouble with the law
and raised questions about violence in sports.
</P>
<P>
   Today was the legal deadline for District Court Judge Mark
Luitjen to lower the sentence. If that doesn't happen, Limon's
lawyers plan to ask that their client spend up to six months in
jail before going on probation.
</P>
<P>
   Though Limon takes responsibility for his action and has
publicly apologized, he did not mean to harm Brent Holmes, said
Carlos Uresti, one of the teen-ager's attorneys.
</P>
<P>
   ''Tony just used poor judgment, and, I guess, got frustrated. He
had no idea he was going to break the kid's nose,'' Uresti said.
</P>
<P>
   At the county jail last week, Limon -- wearing an orange jail
jumpsuit, handcuffs and leg shackles -- told reporters that South
San Antonio coach Gary Durbon approved of his hitting Holmes.
</P>
<P>
   ''He told me it's about time someone shed blood,'' Limon said.
</P>
<P>
   Durbon disputed that statement.
</P>
<P>
   ''I totally deny the accusation,'' Durbon said Thursday,
declining further comment without his lawyer's approval.
</P>
<P>
   Limon's case has fueled debate over whether athletes should be
held accountable in criminal court for what they do in a game.
</P>
<P>
   ''There have been isolated cases of civil lawsuits that a
student used too much force in executing a play, but I've never
heard of a student being criminally charged before,'' Robert
Kanaby, executive director of the National High School Federation,
told The New York Times.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, the League of United Latin American Citizens held a
news conference in San Antonio to decry Limon's punishment.
</P>
<P>
   ''If it's going to be a felony, then let it be known,'' said
LULAC spokeswoman Rosa Rosales. ''But that was accepted behavior.
Whether it was right or wrong, it was accepted behavior.''
</P>
<P>
   In Chicago last year, a teen-ager was charged with aggravated
battery for a hit from behind near the end of a high school hockey
game. A 15-year-old boy was paralyzed from the chest down as a
result.
</P>
<P>
   In professional sports, Boston Bruins player Marty McSorley is
facing assault charges in Vancouver, British Columbia, for hitting
Donald Brashear in the head with a stick in a Feb. 21 game.
</P>
<P>
   In Limon's case, the aggravated assault charge was filed after
last year's game between South San Antonio and East Central High
School.
</P>
<P>
   Videotape footage by a spectator shows Limon and Holmes running
on the court. Limon then hits Holmes in the head with his forearm,
knocking him down. Holmes suffered cuts, a broken nose, a
concussion and had to undergo surgery.
</P>
<P>
   No foul was called for the hit, and Limon played the rest of the
game, which South San Antonio lost. School officials later
suspended Limon for the rest of the season, but he graduated last
spring.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't until last summer that a Bexar County grand jury
indicted Limon on an aggravated assault-serious bodily injury
charge. He agreed to plead no contest in exchange for a sentence
that could range from probation to six years in prison. Limon
applied for and expected probation.
</P>
<P>
   But at sentencing Feb. 7, Luitjen gave him five years behind
bars because Limon was already on probation for attempted burglary.
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, Holmes has sued Durbon and the school district for
$6,000 in medical expenses and other damages.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's really no disputing that it was a vicious, intentional
assault,'' said Ray Leach, Holmes' attorney in the civil lawsuit.
Statements by former players and an assistant coach indicate ''that
the coach encouraged the kind of play that led to this incident,''
</P>
<P>
   ''We think either somebody was turning a blind eye to what was
going on or they knew about it and just overlooked it,'' Leach
said.

<HEADLINE> Albright Talks to EU, NATO Officers  </HEADLINE>
By JEFFREY ULBRICH, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) -- Secretary of State Madeleine Albright,
fresh from a two-day look at peacekeeping operations in Bosnia,
moves on to the even thornier subject of Kosovo in talks today with
European Union and NATO officials.
</P>
<P>
   The European effort in the Balkans is much on her mind, American
officials say, as well as how the creation of a new EU military
force will mesh with NATO in the overall European security picture.
</P>
<P>
   With 20,000 NATO-led troops in Bosnia and 37,000 in Kosovo, the
United States and its European allies have their hands full. While
Bosnia has largely stabilized, allowing NATO to reduce its original
60,000-soldier force by two-thirds, Kosovo remains explosive, a
political settlement with Serbia a distant dream.
</P>
<P>
   Albright is to discuss the Western Balkans, the new European
defense plans, Russia and other issues with Romano Prodi, president
of the European Commission, the executive arm of the EU; Javier
Solana, chief of the EU's foreign and security policy; and NATO
Secretary-General Lord Robertson.
</P>
<P>
   In the evening, she is to attend a dinner hosted by Gen. Wesley
Clark, the American officer who shortly will be leaving his job as
NATO's supreme allied commander in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   The EU decided at its December summit in Helsinki, Finland to
establish a 50,000- to 60,000-strong rapid reaction force capable
of deploying within 60 days and sustaining itself for up to a year.
This force, to be ready by 2003, would allow Europeans to take
action outside the NATO framework in cases where the United States
does not wish to get involved.
</P>
<P>
   Solana said the aim of the EU is to equip itself ''to respond
effectively to international crises using all the tools at its
disposal: diplomacy, economic measures, humanitarian assistance
and, ultimately, the use of military forces.''
</P>
<P>
   The EU recently launched new political and military committees
to start work on the defense initiative.
</P>
<P>
   The United States backs the idea in principle, but not without a
certain concern that the Europeans might go too far, making the EU
the preferred choice over NATO for action. On the other hand, the
United States for years has been pushing the European allies to do
more and spend more in their own defense.
</P>
<P>
   Last spring's air war against Yugoslavia showed the huge gaps in
military capability between the United States and Europe, serious
shortcomings that the allies pledged at their own summit last
spring to overcome.
</P>
<P>
   The situation in Kosovo remains daunting. Clark has complained
that the European allies are not sticking to their troop
commitments. Particularly in view of recent civil disturbances in
the town of Kosovska Mitrovica, Clark wants the force built back to
its original strength of just under 50,000. Some allies have
allowed force levels to drop, giving commanders several thousand
fewer troops.
</P>
<P>
   While the allied military forces in Kosovo struggle to keep
order and provide a secure environment, the United Nations has been
struggling to fulfill its commitments to build a new civil
administration.

<HEADLINE> White House Completing E-mail Review  </HEADLINE>
By PETE YOST, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The White House says it is reviewing its
failure to examine thousands of e-mails that may have been relevant
to congressional investigations into campaign fund-raising.
</P>
<P>
   The House Government Reform Committee chaired by Rep. Dan
Burton, R-Ind., subpoenaed White House records Thursday that might
explain the lapse.
</P>
<P>
   Burton's investigators say they have evidence that presidential
aides discovered in 1998 that because of a computer glitch, many
messages sent to the White House -- 100,000 or more -- had been
overlooked in document reviews for congressional probes. Burton's
staff now wants to know why the White House didn't turn over
relevant e-mails when the problem was uncovered.
</P>
<P>
   In interviews this week with Burton's committee, computer system
employees from Northrop Grumman who worked at the White House said
they were threatened and ordered to keep quiet in 1998 by two
people from the White House Office of Administration.
</P>
<P>
   The contract employees said they were told ''there's a jail cell
with your name on it'' if the workers talked to anyone about this,
including their superiors at Northrup Grumman, said committee
spokesman Mark Corallo.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to reporters, President Clinton said the issue of the
unexamined e-mails ''will all be handled in an appropriate way'' by
White House lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have referred all the questions'' on the e-mails ''to the
counsel's office ... I think they will handle it just fine,''
Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   The existence of the messages didn't become public until last
month when a former White House employee testified about it in a
lawsuit brought by a conservative group, Judicial Watch.
</P>
<P>
   The contract employees told Burton's staff that among the
e-mails are some from former White House intern Monica Lewinsky
after she had been transferred to the Pentagon.
</P>
<P>
   It is unclear whether copies of those e-mails were turned over
to Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr in 1998 in his perjury and
obstruction investigation of the president. ''There were a
significant number of e-mails from Monica Lewinsky,'' said Corallo.
</P>
<P>
   ''While we're not interested in those, we would be interested in
any e-mails pertaining to our several investigations; for instance,
any e-mails from the Democratic National Committee to White House
personnel,'' said Corallo.
</P>
<P>
   White House Counsel Beth Nolan wrote Burton that ''we are
completing our initial review'' and she promised a ''written
description of the measures the White House has taken to address
this matter'' next week. A meeting between Burton and Nolan would
follow.

<HEADLINE> Roman Catholics Apologize for Sins  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON (AP) -- As the Roman Catholic Church enters the season of
Lent, a period of penance, leaders nationwide are offering
apologies for the church's past and present sins against minority
groups, other Christians and alienated members of their own church.
</P>
<P>
   Church leaders in Boston and Santa Fe plan to offer apologies
this weekend. Officials in Los Angeles and Denver already have done
so.
</P>
<P>
   The apologies come in the midst of the Jubilee year, during
which the church is reflecting on its first 2,000 years.
</P>
<P>
   Cardinal Bernard Law of Boston said he was inspired by Pope John
Paul II, and will voice sorrow for Boston Catholics' past and
present sins against Jews, blacks, non-Catholics and others in a
prayer service Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ''We will be looking back to those moments when, through her
members, the church was not faithful to herself, to the message of
Christ, and it's good for us ... to name those things,'' Law said.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, the pope plans to express regret for the Crusades,
the Inquisition and other ''faults of the past.''
</P>
<P>
   He's also expected to allude to anti-Jewish prejudices among
some Catholics, and how that may have facilitated Nazi Germany's
campaign to eliminate European Jews.
</P>
<P>
   In Santa Fe, N.M., Archbishop Michael Sheehan will lead a
service Friday night during which the archdiocese will seek pardon
from other Christians, American Indians, and victims of sexual
abuse, among others.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter published Thursday, Colorado Archbishop Charles J.
Chaput asked Jews to forgive Catholics for a history of wrongs. He
also asks forgiveness for ''the ignorance and prejudice which still
exist'' against the Jewish people.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Cardinal Roger Mahony of Los Angeles apologized to
groups including homosexuals and members of other faiths.
</P>
<P>
   ''We must continue our many efforts at all levels to bring
people together in a spirit of mutual respect and cooperation,''
Mahony said.

<HEADLINE> Street Crime Unit cops accused of attacking four minorities  </HEADLINE>
By DONNA DE LA CRUZ, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Four Ivy League graduates, all minorities, are
accusing police officers from the heavily criticized Street Crime
Unit of subjecting them to a night of terror as they drove through
Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   The plaintiffs -- two men and two women -- have filed a federal
civil rights lawsuit against the NYPD, the Street Crime Unit, and
several officers, alleging the cops used excessive force and
unlawfully detained them. The lawsuit, which seeks unspecified
damages, says none of the plainclothes officers identified
themselves as cops or showed badges.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit, filed Thursday, also alleges race was a factor.
</P>
<P>
   ''This incident vividly shows the price citizens pay for the
aggressive tactics employed by the Street Crime Unit and
demonstrates that it is not only the residents of minority
neighborhoods who suffer from these tactics, but also the city's
best and brightest young professionals,'' said the plaintiffs'
attorneys, Richard D. Emery and Jonathan S. Abady.
</P>
<P>
   Police are telling a different story.
</P>
<P>
   Sgt. Andrew McInnis, a police spokesman, said cops believed the
car the plaintiffs were in was stolen. They made several attempts
to stop the car but the driver would not pull over. The officers
used ''minimum force'' in making the arrests, McInnis said.
</P>
<P>
   Uniformed officers were also present at the scene, he added.
</P>
<P>
   McInnis also stressed that none of the plaintiffs nor their
attorneys have filed complaints with the NYPD's Internal Affairs
Bureau or the Civilian Complaint Review Board.
</P>
<P>
   The Street Crime Unit has been under heavy criticism since four
white officers fired 41 bullets at Guinean immigrant Amadou Diallo
in February 1999, killing him instantly as he stood, unarmed, in
the vestibule of his Bronx apartment building. Last month, all four
officers were acquitted of murder charges.
</P>
<P>
   The Diallo shooting prompted Police Commissioner Howard Safir to
put many of the plainclothes unit back in uniform because of
criticism that residents could not identify the unit's officers as
cops. However, most of the officers still work in plainclothes;
cops making the unit's arrests are in uniform.
</P>
<P>
   The unit's officers patrol high-crime neighborhoods looking for
illegal guns and other criminal activity.
</P>
<P>
   According to the plaintiffs -- Jason Rowley, 25, Sheldon Gilbert,
24, Lauren Sudeall, 23, and Marie Claire Lim, 23 -- their run-in
with police began shortly after they left work at the Magic
Beanstalk, a start-up Internet company based in Williamsburg,
Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   Rowley is a Brown graduate; the other three graduated from Yale.
</P>
<P>
   All four were in Rowley's 1994 Toyota Camry near Union Square in
Manhattan at about 11:30 p.m., on Jan. 10, when Rowley pulled the
car over to let Sudeall and Lim out.
</P>
<P>
   According to the lawsuit, that's when a car resembling a yellow
cab screeched to a halt in front of Rowley's vehicle. A man jumped
out and pointed a gun at Rowley; soon, other men got out of the
yellow car.
</P>
<P>
   ''Fearing for his life and the lives of his passengers, Rowley
ducked behind the steering wheel, put the car in reverse, and drove
backwards to escape,'' the lawsuit said.
</P>
<P>
   But Rowley couldn't go anywhere because he was blocked in by
another unmarked police car. When he stopped, Detective Robert
Williamson allegedly smashed the driver's side window and pulled
Rowley through it, the lawsuit said.
</P>
<P>
   After being handcuffed, Rowley said he was hit, punched, kicked
and then hit with a hard object.
</P>
<P>
   ''I thought he was going to shoot me,'' Rowley, who is black,
said at a news conference at the attorneys' Manhattan office. ''I
was ripped out of my car, handcuffed and beaten up.''
</P>
<P>
   Another plainclothes officer pulled Gilbert, who is black, from
the car, the lawsuit said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Gilbert was then punched and received many blows to his body
and head from two police officers while he was lying on the
ground,'' the lawsuit said. ''A police officer then threw Gilbert's
torso over a concrete barricade.''
</P>
<P>
   Gilbert claimed he put his hands up immediately when he saw the
officers approaching him.
</P>
<P>
   ''They had no badges, no IDs. The approach to the car was very
hostile,'' he said at the news conference.
</P>
<P>
   Lim, a Filipina, and Sudeall, were ordered out of the car and
handcuffed. Sudeall has one parent who is black, another white.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was absolutely terrified for our lives,'' said Lim. ''I was
very confused.''
</P>
<P>
   McInnis said police saw Rowley run a red light and ran his
license plate. The car came back as a stolen vehicle and police
began to follow. At the news conference, Rowley said his car was
stolen in November 1999 and he reported it to the police. A few
days later, police found and returned it to him.
</P>
<P>
   But for some reason, the ''alarm'' -- a police term meaning the
car was reported stolen -- was still on the car on Jan. 10. Police
did not immediately know why.
</P>
<P>
   All four plaintiffs were taken to the 13th Precinct in
Manhattan, where they were questioned. Rowley was charged for
reckless endangerment and reckless driving. The charges were later
dismissed.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, The Center for Constitutional Rights filed a
class-action federal lawsuit alleging the Street Crime Unit
discriminates when it ''stops and frisks'' civilians. The lawsuit
seeks to eliminate frisks that occur without probable cause.

<HEADLINE> Medicare Fraud at $13.5 Billion  </HEADLINE>
By KAREN GULLO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Medicare program losses -- money wasted through
fraud, mistakes and other problems -- inched up to $13.5 billion in
1999 after falling for three consecutive years, government auditors
reported.
</P>
<P>
   The figure means that nearly 8 cents out of every dollar paid by
Medicare last year was wasted. The program paid out $169.5 billion
last year.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, the program lost 7 cents on every dollar, or about
$12.6 billion.
</P>
<P>
   But with losses in previous years coming in at $20 billion or
more, the 1999 figures are evidence that Medicare's seven-year
program to combat fraud and fix mistakes is having an impact, the
program's top official said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The error rate plateau shows that our actions have achieved
sustainable improvement,'' said Nancy-Ann Min DeParle,
administrator of the Health Care Financing Administration, which
runs Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   She said 1999's losses are not much worse, statistically
speaking, than 1998's because they are based on randomly selected
claims that may have had a higher dollar value in 1999 purely by
chance.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, said the agency needs to do more to
cut losses.
</P>
<P>
   ''With all of its available resources, the government should be
able to stop this milking of the Treasury,'' Grassley said.
</P>
<P>
   One troubling finding in the 1999 audit was a big increase in
documentation errors -- one of the most pervasive problems in the
program.
</P>
<P>
   Documentation errors -- when there's little or no paperwork to
determine whether services billed for were actually performed --
caused $5.5 billion in losses. In 1998, those losses were $2.1
billion.
</P>
<P>
   DeParle said HFCA is testing new documentation guidelines and is
expanding education programs to help providers file claims
correctly.
</P>
<P>
   Auditors with the Department of Health and Human Services
Inspector General's office reviewed 5,223 claims from 1999 valued
at $5.4 million. Of those, they found problems with 1,034.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, the first year the comprehensive Medicare audit was
done, overpayments accounted for 14 cents of every dollar spent, or
$23 billion. In 1997, 11 cents on the dollar, or $20 billion, was
lost.
</P>
<P>
   Inspector General June Gibbs Brown also renewed an offer on
Thursday to go easy on health care providers who voluntarily
confess to fraud or billing mistakes, pledging not to kick them out
of Medicare if they can show they have fixed the problems.
</P>
<P>
   ''We want to encourage providers to come forward and disclose
conduct that threatens federal health care programs,'' Brown said
in a letter to providers. A leniency program for those who turn
themselves in began in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The 1999 Medicare audit showed that documentation errors
occurred mostly at home health agencies, medical equipment
suppliers and doctors' offices.
</P>
<P>
   Documentation errors and medically unnecessary procedures have
accounted for $54.8 billion, or 70 percent of the $69.5 billion in
improper payments made during the four years that HHS has been
tracking Medicare's error rates, auditors estimate.

<HEADLINE> NBA Roundup  </HEADLINE>
By BOB GREENE, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   Los Angeles Lakers coach Phil Jackson is chasing himself.
</P>
<P>
   By pounding lowly Golden State 109-92 Thursday night, the Lakers
increased their current undefeated string to a season-high 17.
</P>
<P>
   If they beat Sacramento on Sunday in Los Angeles, the Western
Conference leaders will tie five other teams who have won 18 in a
row, including two that had Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   He was a reserve when the New York Knicks won 18 in a row in
1969, and coached Chicago when the Bulls did the same in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's nice. It's a big number,'' Jackson said Thursday. ''I was
in the league when 18 was a large number, and we used to think that
was an incredible number of games won.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rochester Royals won 18 straight over two seasons in 1950,
the Philadelphia 76ers over two seasons in 1966 and the Boston
Celtics in 1982.
</P>
<P>
   That still trails the NBA record of 33 in a row won by the
Lakers in the 1971-72 season, and 20 straight posted by the
Milwaukee Bucks in 1971 and by the Washington Capitols over two
seasons in 1948.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's incredible to run up this number of wins, because it says
we haven't been defeated in almost six weeks,'' Jackson said.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday night, the battle was almost entirely on the Lakers'
end of the court as Kobe Bryant and Shaquille O'Neal went
one-on-one for team scoring honors. Bryant finished with 30 points,
while O'Neal had 29 points and 13 rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're playing well, playing good defense, moving the ball
well,'' O'Neal said. ''We're just trying to get in position to get
home-court advantage (in the playoffs).''
</P>
<P>
   Larry Hughes had a career-high 41 points for the Warriors, who
have lost four straight.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's OK. We had the game under control,'' Jackson said of
Hughes' big night. ''Sometimes a kid has a game like that and you
have to accept it. Kobe wasn't getting a lot of help on him.''
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers led by 10 points at the half, built their margin to
21 with 2:07 left in the third period and entered the fourth
quarter leading 86-73 despite a 10-2 run by Golden State.
</P>
<P>
   In other games, it was Utah 101, Houston 82; Minnesota 100,
Dallas 79; San Antonio 105, Atlanta 79; and Indiana 127, Portland
119 in overtime.
</P>
<P>
Timberwolves 100, Mavericks 79
</P>
<P>
   In Dallas, Kevin Garnett had 22 points and 13 rebounds to lead
the Timberwolves to their rout. The Mavericks, playing their first
game since releasing controversial forward Dennis Rodman, were led
by Shawn Bradley, who scored a season-high 26 points and pulled
down nine rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   Without Rodman, only an estimated 10,000 showed up to see Dallas
lose its season-high sixth straight.
</P>
<P>
Jazz 101, Rockets 82
</P>
<P>
   In Salt Lake City, John Stockton and Howard Eisley scored 17
points each, while Karl Malone and Bryon Russell added 16 apiece as
hot-shooting Utah won its sixth straight. Moochie Norris and
Shandon Anderson each had 16 points to lead the Rockets.
</P>
<P>
Pacers 127, Trail Blazers 119, OT
</P>
<P>
   In Indianapolis, Mark Jackson hit a trio of 3-pointers in
overtime as Indiana handed Portland its third straight loss and won
its 25th straight at home. Rik Smits scored six of his 22 points in
the extra session as the Pacers overcame a career-high 29-point
effort by Portland reserve Bonzi Wells.
</P>
<P>
Spurs 105, Hawks 79
</P>
<P>
   Visiting San Antonio had first-period runs of 10-0 and 11-0 to
take command early and dominate Atlanta. Avery Johnson and reserve
Antonio Daniels led the Spurs with 18 points each, and another
reserve, Samaki Walker, added 17. Roshown McLeod led the Hawks with
15 points.

<HEADLINE> Irvine, Calif. Streets Evacuated  </HEADLINE>
By CHELSEA J. CARTER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVINE, Calif. (AP) -- A botched hit, a suicide and now the
evacuation of a posh neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   A murder conspiracy case that investigators forced neighbors of
a dead disease researcher out of their homes this week because of
fears he may have hidden chemicals in his back yard.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have never seen anything this bizarre. Every day, it's
something new,'' police Lt. Sam Allevato said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The case has baffled residents of this $580,000-a-house
community in the heart of Orange County, better known for its
University of California campus than for crime.
</P>
<P>
   ''This really has revealed a false sense of security for us. You
really think this happens on the news, in other places. Not here,''
said Gloria Secore. ''Now, I find myself looking at my neighbors a
little differently.''
</P>
<P>
   The story began to unfold nearly two weeks ago when a masked
gunman dressed in black attacked Biofem Pharmaceutical Inc. chief
James Riley in the company parking lot. The gunman fired once,
hitting Riley in the face. He was hospitalized for five days, then
released.
</P>
<P>
   Almost immediately, police focused on Riley's Biofem partner,
Dr. Larry Ford, a medical researcher. The two men were trying to
market a vaginal suppository to combat AIDS transmission and
believed the product would make millions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Before police could question Ford, he committed suicide. Police
have since arrested Ford's longtime friend Dino D'Saachs, 56, as
the getaway driver in the botched hit on Riley. Police continue to
search for the shooter.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, county fire officials and the FBI's hazardous
materials and bomb squad found three canisters of unidentified
liquid buried in Ford's backyard, Allevato said.
</P>
<P>
   A search of the house yielded thousands of rounds of rifle
ammunition hidden beneath a trap door, he said.
</P>
<P>
   More than 49 families were evacuated to a nearby hotel and a
local elementary school was closed for the week. Pink ''cleared''
signs were hung on doors, garages and metal gates of empty homes.
</P>
<P>
   Another 50 families were told to be ready to leave if anything
was found.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's scary,'' said Paul Chu, who has lived in the area since
the houses were built 15 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Outside of Secore's house, she and two friends discussed the
media and police spectacle unfolding across the street.
</P>
<P>
   ''The news helicopters started at 5:30 this morning, and the
'beep-beep' of the (police emergency) trucks backing up went on all
night. This morning, some guy shoved a microphone in my face,''
Secore said. ''It's like we've been invaded.''
</P>
<P>
   All three said the case was a lesson about morals and neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   ''Try to have some morals. Stand up and be accountable for your
actions,'' Secore said. ''It also goes to show, how well do you
really know who's in your neighborhood? I'm going to make more of
an effort to know who's here.''
</P>
<P>
   Down the street, Martha Biemann sat in her car with three of her
children.
</P>
<P>
   She said she's been honest with her children about what's
happening -- about the attempted murder, the suicide and why the FBI
is in their neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   ''I can't hide it from them, even though I really want to,'' she
said. ''They've heard on the news and from their friends, and now
they are seeing it. My son is going across the street to play
basketball on his best friend's driveway and they've been evacuated
... I tell them this is not normal.''

<HEADLINE> Lawmakers Eye Fetal Tissue Research  </HEADLINE>
By JANELLE CARTER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Researchers and advocacy groups are urging
Congress not to institute restrictions on fetal tissue research in
the wake of allegations that an illegal market has developed for
tissue from abortions.
</P>
<P>
   A House panel on Thursday heard from patients who view fetal
tissue research as among the best hopes they have for finding new
treatments for illnesses such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's
disease and diabetes.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am concerned that today's hearing will have a chilling
effect that will slow, if not stop, vital medical research,'' Joan
Samuelson, president of Parkinson's Action Network, told the House
Commerce health and environment subcommittee.
</P>
<P>
   ''Research ... is my best hope for the future,'' said Samuelson,
who suffers from the disease.
</P>
<P>
   Anti-abortion lawmakers have expressed concern that some tissue
retrieval companies are illegally charging exorbitant prices to
make a profit from the procedure. One pathologist who bragged of
the profitability of fetal tissue before hidden cameras on an
episode of ABC's ''20/20'' this week did not respond to a subpoena
from the House panel to testify Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Under federal law, it is legal to use fetal tissue for research
as long as it is donated, not sold, by the woman. Congress in 1993
lifted a ban on federally funded research using fetal tissue, but
made it a felony to purchase or sell the tissue for profit. The law
allows only reasonable charges to cover the cost of extracting and
transferring tissue to researchers.
</P>
<P>
   The complaint by anti-abortion lawmakers is that some tissue
retrieval companies are charging prices as high as $325 for a
spinal cord and $75 for a single eye.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers agreed to begin contempt-of-Congress proceedings
against Dr. Miles Jones, the Missouri pathologist who appeared on
television, and have asked the Justice Department to investigate
allegations raised by the television program.
</P>
<P>
   But Samuelson urged lawmakers to use caution before acting
against fetal tissue research.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am concerned that in attempting to enforce the laws
governing fetal tissue research ... Congress may unnecessarily
over-restrict fetal tissue research,'' said Dr. Samuel M. Cohen, a
University of Nebraska Medical Center pathologist. ''This would be
a grave mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Henry Waxman, D-Calif., reminded lawmakers that they
approved the use of fetal tissue to help find cures and treatments
for diseases. ''We cannot lose sight of that.''
</P>
<P>
   But Rep. Chris Smith, R-N.J., said, ''Babies are not guinea
pigs. This is just one day in this ongoing battle to stop this
heinous practice.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans had hoped to buttress their allegations that fetal
tissue is being sold illegally with the testimony of former clinic
employee Lawrence Dean Alberty.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Alberty, of Lee's Summit, Mo., said under oath that he
had no knowledge of a profiteering scheme despite comments he made
on an anti-abortion group's video.
</P>
<P>
   ''Anything I said on the video when I was not under oath, that
is a different story,'' Alberty told lawmakers.

<HEADLINE> Mayor objects to Whitney exhibit linking him to Nazis  </HEADLINE>
By TIMOTHY WILLIAMS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Another art controversy anyone?
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Rudolph Giuliani is scheduled to be featured prominently
in the upcoming Biennial show at the Whitney Museum of American
Art. Just don't expect him to plunk down his 10 bucks to see the
exhibition, in which one piece links him to the Nazis.
</P>
<P>
   ''Gee, I'll put it on my Palm Pilot,'' Giuliani said
sarcastically Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Though clearly unamused by the museum's plans to set aside an
entire room for the piece by a New York artist during the prominent
show, Giuliani promised that his objections would not reach the
level of those stirred by a dung-decorated painting of the Virgin
Mary displayed last year at the Brooklyn Museum of Art.
</P>
<P>
   While the Brooklyn Museum receives a large part of its operating
budget from the city, the Whitney gets only a small amount of city
money, mostly for educational programs.
</P>
<P>
   ''If people want to engage in desecrating religion or attacking
people's ethnicity or race, then in America -- even though it's
difficult to accept for a lot of people -- people have a right to do
that,'' said Giuliani. ''But they've got to use their own money to
do it. They have to pay for it themselves. You can't be using
taxpayer's money to do the kinds of things that were being done at
the Brooklyn Museum.''
</P>
<P>
   Last summer, the Brooklyn Museum drew Giuliani's ire by
including in its much-hyped ''Sensation'' show a portrait of the
Virgin Mary by British artist Chris Ofili that incorporated
elephant dung and cutouts of nude female body parts.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani, who said the painting demeaned Catholics, halted city
funding to the museum and kept the issue on front pages by
complaining about the painting almost every day for weeks.
</P>
<P>
   A federal judge eventually ruled that the city could not
withhold money and the museum's funding was restored.
</P>
<P>
   This time, the piece is ''Sanitation'' by artist Hans Haacke -- a
work inspired by the Brooklyn Museum brouhaha.
</P>
<P>
   The German-born Haacke's installation consists of a wall lined
with a row of garbage cans, each containing a speaker playing an
audiotape of marching soldiers. On a wall above will be a copy of
the First Amendment framed in gold and six printed quotations --
three from Giuliani discussing the Ofili painting, and three from
prominent conservatives, including Republican Sen. Jesse Helms, of
North Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   The quotations are in Gothic typescript -- a style said to be
favored by Adolf Hitler.
</P>
<P>
   One of the Giuliani quotes says: ''I would ask people to step
back and think about civilization. Civilization has been about
trying to find the right place to put excrement, not on the walls
of museums.''
</P>
<P>
   In another, the mayor promises to ''remove funding for the
Brooklyn Museum until the director comes to his senses.'' The third
quote states that since the museum has ''no compunction about
putting their hands in the taxpayers' pockets,'' Giuliani had no
''compunction about putting them out of business.''
</P>
<P>
   The other remarks are from Helms, Reform Party presidential
candidate Patrick Buchanan and Christian broadcaster Pat Robertson
criticizing public funding of art they deem offensive. Buchanan is
quoted as saying: ''This elite cries 'censorship' and falls back
upon that last refuge of the modern scoundrel, the First
Amendment.''
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani said Thursday that what bothered him most about reports
about Haacke's work is its downplaying of the significance of the
Holocaust.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is an issue here about demeaning the whole historical
and contemporary importance of the Holocaust, and when people
misuse descriptions like that, in essence, they do a grave
injustice to the people who suffered in the Holocaust and to the
reality of what the Holocaust is all about,'' Giuliani said.
</P>
<P>
   Abraham H. Foxman, national director of the Anti-Defamation
League, wrote the museum's director, Maxwell L. Anderson, to
express his disappointment with the decision to display the work.
</P>
<P>
   ''No matter what statement the artist intended to make about
contemporary issues, there can be no comparison to the Nazi's Final
Solution for the extermination of European Jewry,'' Foxman said.
</P>
<P>
   The exhibit is scheduled to open March 23.

<HEADLINE> Lawmakers Tout Juvenile Crime Plans  </HEADLINE>
By ANJETTA McQUEEN, AP Education Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A group of House lawmakers, taking a break
from ongoing contentious debate over gun control, is touting early
childhood programs, afterschool centers, community policing and
better access to job training and college as ways to combat youth
violence.
</P>
<P>
   Two dozen House members who began meeting last year after the
Columbine High School shootings in Colorado said Thursday they
would recommend to their Democratic and Republican party leaders
that further work on youth crime laws include these solutions.
</P>
<P>
   Differences over gun safety regulations have caused a deadlock
on Capitol Hill of juvenile justice bills that continues despite a
White House meeting this week to prod negotiators.
</P>
<P>
   ''What we looked at was the whole array of interests, ideas,
philosophies and solutions,'' said Rep. Bob Barr, R-Ga., who
opposes gun control legislation. ''We didn't leave anything off the
table other than the very divisive issue which is debated and will
continue to be debated and that is gun control issues and their
effects on crime.''
</P>
<P>
   The group's report discusses ways that schools and communities
are helping troubled children but does not offer specific proposals
to boost violence prevention programs.
</P>
<P>
   ''We didn't try to put price tags on any of the proposals in
this report,'' said Rep. Martin Frost, D-Texas, who headed the
group with Rep. Jennifer Dunn, R-Wash.
</P>
<P>
   Another group member, Rep. Robert Scott, D-Va., said he would
propose legislation to help juvenile courts rehabilitate rather
than simply jail troubled youth offenders.
</P>
<P>
   ''When it comes to the question of how to reduce youth crime, we
have a decision to make,'' Scott said. ''We can either play
politics or we can choose to reduce youth crime.''
</P>
<P>
   House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., along with the House's top
Democrat, Rep. Dick Gephardt of Missouri, had asked the lawmakers
to identify causes of violence and find solutions both parties
could support.
</P>
<P>
   ''Their report reinforces that Congress should play a supportive
role in combatting youth violence,'' Hastert said.
</P>
<P>
   Aides to the House Judiciary Committee chairman, Rep. Henry
Hyde, R-Ill., said he found some merit in the recommendations and
would study the group's report.

<HEADLINE> HMO Patients' Protections Sought  </HEADLINE>
BY KAREN GULLO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- With Democrats complaining that major
patients' rights provisions are being sidelined, congressional
negotiators agreed to let consumers use out-of-plan hospitals in
emergencies and to prevent plans from discriminating against
providers.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats on a House-Senate conference committee working out a
compromise between competing patients' rights bills said the two
sides should start working on their biggest areas of disagreement:
whether patients should be allowed to sue and who would be covered
by the legislation.
</P>
<P>
   ''These are matters we really have to resolve first,'' Rep. John
Dingell, D-Mich., said.
</P>
<P>
   The bipartisan House measure would cover 160 million Americans
with private insurance and allow patients to sue if they were hurt
by a health plan's decision to deny care.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate bill crafted by Republicans applies to 55 million
Americans whose health plans are not regulated by states. It
prohibits lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the panel has concentrated on basic patient protections
that lawmakers from both houses generally agree on. Last week, for
example, lawmakers agreed that pediatricians could be designated as
a child's primary care physician without prior approval from health
plans.
</P>
<P>
   Dingell said that finding compromises on lawsuits and scope that
both sides can support will ''make or break'' the committee's work.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Don Nickles, R-Okla., chairman of the conference committee,
said he was open to starting talks on lawsuits and applicability,
but wanted to finish up other matters first.
</P>
<P>
   ''We can continue a good full effort on the patients'
protections and then we can certainly begin some discussions on
some ideas on scope ... and appeals,'' Nickles said.

<HEADLINE> Clinton's Budget Analyzed  </HEADLINE>
By ALAN FRAM, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A new report by the Congressional Budget
Office is providing election-year ammunition for both parties to
accuse each other of jeopardizing Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   CBO, Congress' nonpartisan budget analyst, issued its annual
look at President Clinton's budget on Thursday. And Democrats
seized on it to argue that Texas Gov. George W. Bush's proposed
five-year, $483 billion tax cut would eat into Social Security
surpluses, something both parties have pledged not to do.
</P>
<P>
   The budget office projected that from 2002 through 2006 -- when
the likely GOP presidential nominee's tax cut would occur -- federal
surpluses under one scenario would total $247 billion, excluding
Social Security. That would be too small for Bush's plan without
eating into Social Security funds.
</P>
<P>
   ''It would exceed the non-Social Security surplus,'' Sen. Frank
Lautenberg, D-N.J., said of the proposed Bush tax cut.
</P>
<P>
   Under different CBO projections that assume lower spending,
surpluses would be larger and there would be room for Bush's plan.
It is doubtful, however, that there would be enough support in
Congress to trim spending that deeply.
</P>
<P>
   As he released the report to the Senate Budget Committee, CBO
Director Dan Crippen also took an unusually strong swipe at
President Clinton's plan for strengthening Social Security and
Medicare, calling it a ''misconception'' to believe it would have
an impact on either program's solvency.
</P>
<P>
   Crippen said Clinton's proposal to move billions of dollars in
federal surpluses into the Social Security and Medicare trust funds
would do little to buttress those programs. He questioned Clinton's
claims that building up the trust funds would help, saying, ''I
know he is not alone in that misconception.''
</P>
<P>
   Crippen added, ''The transfers would not, as some have asserted,
strengthen Medicare or Social Security. At most, they might have
the opposite effect of imparting a false sense of security.''
</P>
<P>
   Crippen's comments echoed criticisms Republicans have made of
Clinton's plans for helping the two programs, which provide medical
insurance and pensions for more than 40 million Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Most analysts agree that to best prepare Social Security and
Medicare for the coming retirement of the baby boomers, the
programs' revenues will have to be increased or benefits reduced.
</P>
<P>
   CBO has traditionally been a nonpartisan agency. But in recent
months, some Democrats have complained that Crippen -- a GOP
appointee -- has produced some analyses tilted toward Republicans.
Crippen has denied that.
</P>
<P>
   Lautenberg called Crippen's presentation ''biased'' because it
did not acknowledge that both programs would be helped by Clinton's
plan for massive debt reduction.
</P>
<P>
   ''The millions of Americans who would have access to these
programs for many more years, I am sure, would consider that a very
positive thing,'' spokeswoman Linda Ricci of the White House budget
office said of Clinton's plans.
</P>
<P>
   Most economists say that debt reduction strengthens the economy
and should make it easier for the government to raise the revenue
it will need in the future to pay Social Security and Medicare
benefits to baby boomers.
</P>
<P>
   The CBO analysis of Clinton's budget had slightly rosier
projections of federal surpluses than the CBO presented in January.
The improvement of several billion dollars a year was caused by
CBO's expectation of slightly lower spending than it thought two
months ago.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next decade, CBO said, surpluses are still expected to
total from $900 billion to $1.9 trillion, excluding Social
Security's vast surpluses and depending on how much spending is
assumed.
</P>
<P>
   The agency also said under Clinton's plan the government should
be able to retire the $3.6 trillion publicly held debt by 2010 --
assuming that people and institutions who hold Treasury bonds are
willing to sell them back. Clinton has said he wants to retire it
by 2013.
</P>
<P>
   The overall national debt is $5.7 trillion. About $3.6 trillion
is held by the public, the rest is money the government owes itself
for Social Security and other trust funds.

<HEADLINE> $9B OK'd for U.S. Troops in Kosovo  </HEADLINE>
By ALAN FRAM, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The House could approve a $9 billion measure
for Colombia, U.S. forces in Kosovo and other programs next week,
despite grumbling by an unusual coalition of Democrats and
conservative Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   The House Appropriations Committee approved the package Thursday
on a 33-13 vote, paving the way for House consideration. Its
prospects are dimmer in the Senate, where GOP leaders have shown
little enthusiasm for the legislation.
</P>
<P>
   In a committee meeting that lasted nearly seven hours, the chief
target for amendments was the package's $1.7 billion for
stabilizing the government of Colombia and fighting drug
traffickers in that and other Andean nations.
</P>
<P>
   The committee voted 36-20 to reject an effort by Rep. David
Obey, D-Wis., to withhold $552 million of that money. It also used
a mostly party-line 31-23 vote to reject an effort by Rep. Nancy
Pelosi, D-Calif., to add $1.3 billion for drug treatment and
prevention programs in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ''If anyone thinks drug use in the United States is not
emergency status, you better think again,'' said Rep. Sonny
Callahan, R-Ala.
</P>
<P>
   But Obey and others argued that the United States risks a
costly, 10-year involvement in Colombia, where a decades-long civil
war already has taken 35,000 lives. Colombia has become the world's
top cocaine producer, and efforts by Bogota to stop the traffickers
have so far produced scant results.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't see why we should be embarking on a campaign that will
be highly expensive and could lead to a lot of other problems,''
Obey said.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton proposed $1.3 billion for Colombia and other
Andean nations, on top of $300 million already in the pipeline.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to committee leaders, White House budget chief Jack
Lew lauded lawmakers' ''timely support,'' saying it would ''help to
stem the flow of drugs into the United States and will further
benefit the United States by bringing greater peace and prosperity
to an important ally.''
</P>
<P>
   The aid to Colombia includes money to supply 63 helicopters,
train and equip Colombian troops and police, strengthen human
rights efforts and persuade coca farmers to grow other crops.
Included are small amounts of aid for Peru, Bolivia and Ecuador.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to opposition by some Democrats to the Colombia
package, many conservatives say the overall bill is too expensive.
The $9 billion bill is almost double the $5.2 billion Clinton
requested, and it is almost entirely paid for out of the budget
surplus.
</P>
<P>
   The bill also includes:
</P>
<P>
   --$2.2 billion for recovery from last fall's Hurricane Floyd and
other disasters. Clinton has proposed $1.2 billion. The extra money
includes $7 million to combat Pierce's disease, which is hurting
Southern California farms, and $40 million to help Florida
producers of lime and other crops damaged by the citrus canker.
</P>
<P>
   --All $2 billion Clinton wants for the costs of American forces
in Kosovo, and the $25 million for U.S. operations in East Timor.
</P>
<P>
   --$1.6 billion to cover the Pentagon's higher fuel bill caused by
rising oil prices and $854 million to bolster the Defense
Department's health insurance program. Clinton asked for neither.
</P>
<P>
   --$104 million to build a new U.S. embassy in Sarajevo, Bosnia.
But it ignores the additional $135 million Clinton requested for
new diplomatic buildings in Pristina, Kosovo, and in Tirana,
Albania.
</P>
<P>
   --$40 million Clinton wants to help residents near the Vieques,
Puerto Rico, firing range used by the Navy.

<HEADLINE> MOMA to assist in planning of new Tokyo art museum  </HEADLINE>
By BETH GARDINER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Tokyo is getting a new contemporary art museum,
thanks to a lot of money from a major Japanese developer and a
little help from New York's Museum of Modern Art.
</P>
<P>
   MOMA is advising builder Minoru Mori as he plans a museum on the
top floors of a skyscraper set to go up in the center of the
Japanese capital, Mori and MOMA officials said at a news conference
held Thursday in midtown Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   The Mori Art Center, part of a business, shopping and
residential complex expected to occupy 27 acres in a busy area of
Tokyo, is scheduled to open in 2003. Mori said he hopes to display
late 20th century and 21st century art from around the world and
also to make his new museum a center for Asian culture.
</P>
<P>
   ''We hope it will enhance the culture ... in Tokyo, instill an
appreciation of art in our young people and draw visitors from
around the world,'' Mori said. ''We can succeed in creating
something new and fantastic.''
</P>
<P>
   Mori, who heads one of Japan's largest development companies,
plans to make the museum the center of a new mega-complex in the
Roppongi section of Tokyo, famous for its nightlife and
international flavor.
</P>
<P>
   The $4.2 billion, 7-million-square-foot Roppongi Hills
development will include shopping, theaters, residential towers,
office space and the new headquarters for TV Asahi, Mori said. At
its heart will be a sleek 54-story building whose top five floors
will house the art center.
</P>
<P>
   ''In my mind, the Mori Art Center will be the jewel of the crown
of the whole project,'' said Mori, speaking through a translator
during the news conference at the MOMA.
</P>
<P>
   Mori said he did not know how much the museum would cost to
build or what its budget would be.
</P>
<P>
   MOMA, which will soon begin a $500 million expansion project
that will force its own main building to close temporarily, plans
to advise Mori on how to design and operate the museum in
accordance with the standards of the international art world, said
MOMA director Glenn Lowry.
</P>
<P>
   ''What we are providing for Mr. Mori is essentially advice and
guidance on how to build a museum,'' Lowry said. ''We welcome that
opportunity to help build a great new museum in the center of
Tokyo.''
</P>
<P>
   Once the Mori center opens, MOMA will send some of its special
exhibitions to be displayed there, Lowry said. The relationship
will not be exclusive, though. MOMA will continue working with
other museums in Japan, and the Mori center will collaborate with
museums around the world, Lowry said.
</P>
<P>
   Mori is also receiving advice from an international advisory
committee, which includes officials from the Royal Academy of Arts
in London and the Georges Pompidou Center in Paris. The builder is
conducting an international search to choose a director for the new
museum.
</P>
<P>
   Lowry praised the new center as a great boon to Tokyo's cultural
life.
</P>
<P>
   ''A museum can be a focal point, a way of enriching the lives of
individuals,'' he said. ''Mori Art Center is one of the most
innovative programs taking place anywhere in Asia.''
</P>
<P>
   The museum plans to focus on architecture and design as well as
modern and contemporary art. It will aim to bring the best of
Western art to Japan and also offer a special focus on Asian
artists.
</P>
<P>
   Mori -- who is one of Japan's biggest builders and is currently
working in China on what he hopes will be the world's tallest
building -- said the museum will not initially try to amass its own
collection. Rather, it will bring exhibitions from around the world
to its 65,000 square feet of exhibition space and also create its
own shows.
</P>
<P>
   Planners talked about the spectacular views of Tokyo that
art-lovers would enjoy from panoramic windows and outdoor terraces
atop a building that is expected to be one of the city's tallest.
</P>
<P>
   Museum-goers will enter a translucent, cone-shaped structure
separate from the main tower and climb a spiral staircase to a
bridge that leads them to the skyscraper. An elevator will run to
the top of the building, where a three-story lobby will have a
conical ceiling which New York-based architect Richard Gluckman
hopes will echo the downstairs entrance.
</P>
<P>
   Galleries will occupy the top two floors and three more stories
will be used for conferences and educational programs.

<HEADLINE> Committee OKs Terror Victims' Bill  </HEADLINE>
By TOM RAUM, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Legislation to help former hostages and other
victims of state-sponsored terrorism to collect court judgments is
headed for Senate action after a unanimous endorsement by the
Senate Judiciary Committee.
</P>
<P>
   The measure, by Sens. Connie Mack, R-Fla., and Frank Lautenberg,
D-N.J., would set up a process for successful U.S. plaintiffs to
recover from countries that are on the State Department's list of
countries that sponsor or support terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration opposes the bill, claiming it could
result in retaliation against U.S. diplomatic properties abroad.
However, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright told Congress last
month that she was willing to work with former terrorism victims
and their families to find a way to help them collect.
</P>
<P>
   Among those who might benefit from the legislation are the
families of four Americans killed when their small plane was shot
down by Cuban fighter jets in 1996, former American hostages who
were held in Lebanon in the 1980s, the family of Alisa Flatow, an
American college student killed in Israel by Islamic terrorists,
and the families of victims of Pan Am flight 103.
</P>
<P>
   But, even though some of these individuals have been awarded
hundreds of millions in judgments under a 1996 law allowing them to
sue in U.S. courts, not a cent has yet been collected.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration in the past has gone to court to
block these plaintiffs from collecting, even though Clinton
initially requested the 1996 legislation.
</P>
<P>
   ''The President pledged to fight terrorism, made promises to
victims families, encouraged them to seek justice and signed
several laws supporting the rights of victims to take terrorists to
court,'' Mack said after Thursday's committee vote. ''But
ultimately he has chosen to protect terrorists assets over the
rights of American citizens seeking justice.''
</P>
<P>
   ''This brings us one step closer to deterring terrorist attacks
against Americans abroad and to obtaining compensation for the
Flatow family and other victims of terrorism here at home,'' said
Lautenberg.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice for Victims of Terrorism Act would free frozen
assets to satisfy U.S. court judgments in terrorism cases. However,
it gives the president authority to protect diplomatic properties
from seizure.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Financial services industry tops list of Giuliani donors  </HEADLINE>
By SHANNON McCAFFREY, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- When it comes to out-of-state campaign
contributions, Rudolph Giuliani is giving Hillary Rodham Clinton a
run for her money.
</P>
<P>
   Contributions of over $200 for the New York City mayor have
poured in from every state except North Dakota, according to an
analysis of his campaign filings released on Thursday by the Center
for Responsive Politics.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor raised 44 percent of his money from outside New York
when considering donations of $200 or more, the nonpartisan center
found. An earlier analysis by the Washington D.C.-based center
showed the first lady raised 56 percent of similar contributions
from outside New York, taking in money from 45 states.
</P>
<P>
   The Giuliani camp has been critical of Clinton's out-of-state
fund raising. But the mayor's campaign manager, Bruce Teitelbaum,
defended Giuliani's own money sources by saying the Senate race has
''national significance.''
</P>
<P>
   The financial services industry led Giuliani's donor list,
giving the mayor $1.9 million. Lawyers led Clinton's giving,
donating $666,879, and were closely followed by people in the
entertainment industry, who contributed $439,740.
</P>
<P>
   Within financial services, the securities industry gave Giuliani
$782,000; the real estate industry $488,000; and accountants
$112,000, the center found.
</P>
<P>
   Retirees gave the mayor $781,000 and lawyers gave $429,000.
</P>
<P>
   Eight of Giuliani's top 20 donors were securities firms, with
Credit Suisse First Boston topping the list. The company's
executives and their immediate families donated $121,800 to
Giuliani's campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Among Giuliani's collections from out-of-state, $694,000 came
from New Jersey, $448,000 from Texas, $405,000 from Connecticut,
and $380,000 from California.
</P>
<P>
   New York donors who contributed more than $200 apiece gave
Giuliani $4.5 million in total.
</P>
<P>
   CRP Executive Director Larry Makinson scolded the Giuliani camp
for failing to disclose the occupations or employers for 21 percent
of his large contributors, who together contributed more than $1.8
million to the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Makinson said Giuliani's nondisclosure ranked ''among the
worst.''
</P>
<P>
   Federal election law requires candidates to make their ''best
effort'' to identify the employers and occupations of donors.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton camp failed to provide occupation information for 5
percent of its donors, who contributed just under $300,000, the
center found. Texas Gov. George W. Bush, who has raised some $70
million for his presidential bid, has managed to provide
information on 90 percent, Makinson said.
</P>
<P>
   Without employer data it is impossible to calculate exactly
which industries and companies have been most generous to a
candidate, Makinson said.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton camp immediately seized on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   ''Just what is Rudy hiding from the people of New York?''
Clinton campaign spokesman Howard Wolfson asked.
</P>
<P>
   In 1999, Giuliani raised $11.8 million for his Senate campaign,
compared to Clinton's $8 million. The center's analysis considered
only donations over $200 because the candidates are not required to
itemize amounts below that.
</P>
<P>
   That means the analysis does not account for $3.3 million in
donations to Giuliani or $1.9 million to Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The first lady continued to rake in money from outside New York
on Thursday, traveling to Omaha, Neb., for a $1,000 a person fund
raiser hosted by billionaire investor Warren Buffet, InfoUSA
founder Vinod Gupta and Democratic Sen. Bob Kerrey. Kerrey is
leaving the Senate to run the New School University in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Gupta, a frequent Democratic donor, contributed $1 million to
the recent White House Millennium celebration organized by the
first lady. Kerrey had reportedly been promoting Gupta for an
ambassadorship to either Bermuda or Fiji, but Gupta didn't get
either job.
</P>
<P>
   Coming in second among Giuliani's donors was a group of 40 real
estate firms affiliated under the umbrella of the Kushner Companies
of Florham Park, N.J. Together, they contributed $86,000 to the
mayor's Senate effort.
</P>
<P>
   Pfizer Inc. was another top donor. Together, the pharmaceutical
giant's political action committee, employees, and employees'
families gave $44,994. Employees of the City of New York were also
high on the list. They gave $40,450 to Giuliani's Senate campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Those connected to Walt Disney, especially the Miramax films
division, were Clinton's single biggest contributors, with
employees and their families giving the first lady $56,500.

<HEADLINE> NBC Stations Won't Air New Sitcom  </HEADLINE>
By LYNN ELBER, AP Television Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- ''God, the Devil and Bob'' didn't leave them
laughing in Idaho, Mississippi and three others states where NBC
affiliates refused to show the animated comedy about a man who
meets God in a bar.
</P>
<P>
   The series, which premiered Thursday and is set to move into a
Tuesday night time slot, focuses on the moral questions faced by an
everyman named Bob.
</P>
<P>
   In Thursday's episode, a dispirited God -- portrayed as an old,
bearded hippie wearing a tie-dyed T-shirt -- considers destroying a
world that appears to be unworthy of salvation. It's up to
autoworker Bob to prove him wrong.
</P>
<P>
   James Garner does the voice of God, who is shown enjoying beer,
marveling at the invention of toaster pastry and using an epithet
to describe the devil, who is voiced by Alan Cumming. French
Stewart is the voice of Bob.
</P>
<P>
   At least nine of more than 220 NBC affiliates nationwide
declined to air the show because of its subject matter, including
those in Boise, Pocatello and Twin Falls, Idaho; Salt Lake City;
Tupelo, Hattiesburg and Jackson, Miss.; Shreveport, La.; and South
Bend, Ind.
</P>
<P>
   One religious group also criticized the show.
</P>
<P>
   ''This kind of tasteless and trivial portrayal of God does a
disservice to the millions of American television viewers who have
deeply felt religious beliefs,'' said Nihad Awad, executive
director of the Council on American-Islamic Relations in
Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   Series creator Matthew Carlson, a former seminary student,
called the reaction unwarranted. He said viewers should have the
right to judge for themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ''We expected controversy but not prior censorship,'' Carlson
said. ''I can understand it's a sensitive issue, but we took that
into account when we made the series. I think the show comes out on
the side of the angels. I like to think we're laughing with God,
not at him.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Ellwood Kieser, a Los Angeles priest and producer who
consulted on the series, questioned why a station would ban ''God,
the Devil and Bob'' but run an NBC sitcom like ''Veronica's
Closet,'' whose main character owns a lingerie company and
sometimes has scantily clad models.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think this is a good show for a family to watch together and
discuss,'' Kieser said. ''I think it's unique because it pulls
people into the religious realm, into a God-centered universe.''
</P>
<P>
   NBC said it considers the show entertaining and hopes the
affiliates eventually will reconsider.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was never our intention to offend anyone,'' the network
said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   South Bend's WNDU, which is owned by the University of Notre
Dame, asked NBC to let the station air the program after ''Saturday
Night Live'' this weekend, when fewer children would be watching,
programming director Lou Pierce said. The network declined.
</P>
<P>
   ''In our estimation, the show is too frank,'' Pierce said.
''Whereas other shows rely on innuendo, this one doesn't.''
</P>
<P>
   Another station executive echoed his position.
</P>
<P>
   ''Even though it's a cartoon, it's not a kids' program,'' said
Doug Armstrong, president and general manager of KVTB in Boise.
''It has adult humor and themes, yet the marketing seems geared
toward younger kids. Kids and families are our priority so we have
asked NBC to schedule the program later in the evening.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the stations, KSL in Salt Lake City, also refuses to air
''Saturday Night Live'' because of its content.

<HEADLINE> Senate OKs 2 Controversial Judges  </HEADLINE>
By JIM ABRAMS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Senate confirmed the appointments of two
judges to the 9th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals after years of
debate over whether the adjudicators were too liberal and whether
women and minority nominees have a tougher time winning approval.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate confirmed Richard A. Paez and Marsha Berzon as
federal appellate judges Thursday. Berzon was approved by a vote of
64-34, and later Paez, was confirmed by a 59-39 vote.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore, interrupting his presidential campaign
schedule, made a rare appearance in the Senate to be ready to cast
a vote, in his capacity as president of the Senate, in case of a
tie. That wasn't necessary.
</P>
<P>
   Gore celebrated the confirmations by saying, in Spanish,
''Friends, today we've finally achieved justice.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We've seen a troubling pattern of the Republican Party
standing against qualified judicial nominees who happen to be women
and minorities,'' he said at a news conference. Paez is
Mexican-American and was strongly supported by Hispanic groups.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton also referred to the nominees' diverse
backgrounds in hailing the votes at the end of a White House
meeting with religious leaders: ''I think maybe we're, by fits and
starts, moving toward our one America.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton later thanked the Senate for the votes but added that
dozens of judicial nominees still await confirmation.
''Election-year politics should not be used as an excuse to slow
down the confirmation process,'' he said. With Thursday's votes,
there were 73 vacant federal judgeships, nearly 10 percent of the
total.
</P>
<P>
   Paez, now a U.S. District Court judge in Los Angeles, has been
waiting more than four years for Thursday's vote, longer than any
other nominee in history. Berzon, a San Francisco lawyer, was
nominated by Clinton two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Senate conservatives succeeded in delaying their confirmation
votes, contending the nominees are too liberal and would add to
what they consider the activist tendencies of the San
Francisco-based 9th Circuit, which covers a vast area of the West.
</P>
<P>
   Paez has been criticized by conservatives for his statements
about affirmative action and benefits for illegal immigrants.
Berzon has angered conservatives with her defense work for labor
groups.
</P>
<P>
   The nominees' opponents have vehemently denied that minority or
female candidates are treated differently, and said race was never
an issue when many Democrats opposed the Supreme Court nomination
of Clarence Thomas, a conservative black.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think they are activist judges. I think they are out of the
mainstream of American thought and I don't think either one should
be on the court,'' Sen. Bob Smith, R-N.H., said of Paez and Berzon.
</P>
<P>
   The political vitriol became intense last fall when the Senate,
along party lines, rejected a black nominee, Missouri State Supreme
Court Judge Ronnie White, for a federal judgeship. Clinton called
the vote a disgrace and linked it to the long delay on Paez.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., voted against both
Paez and Berzon.
</P>
<P>
   ''I would have preferred that they never had been nominated,''
said Lott, but he nevertheless abided by a promise he made last
fall to give the two a yes-or-no vote.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Jeff Sessions, R-Ala., made a last-ditch attempt to deny
Paez that vote, introducing a motion to postpone it pending an
investigation into Paez's role in a plea agreement the Justice
Department reached with John Huang, who was accused of raising more
than $1 million in illegal contributions for the Democrats during
the 1996 presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Sessions, a former federal prosecutor rejected for a federal
judgeship by the Senate Judiciary Committee in 1986, contended that
in approving that plea bargain, Paez ''may have improperly
acquiesced to a 'sweetheart deal' which advanced the interests of
the Clinton-Gore administration rather than the interests of
justice and the American people.'' His motion was defeated, 67-31.
</P>
<P>
   Berzon, reached at home, thanked Senate Judiciary Committee
Chairman Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, who urged his conservative colleagues
to allow the votes and cast his in favor of both Berzon and Paez.
''I look forward to sitting on the 9th Circuit and pledge to
approach every case in a fair, thoughtful and open-minded manner.''
</P>
<P>
   But some bitter feelings remained. Thomas Jipping of the
conservative Free Congress Foundation said Republicans who voted
for the nominations had helped ''move the nation's most activist
court further in the wrong direction.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Patrick Leahy of Vermont, the Judiciary Committee's top
Democrat, said that by stalling on nominations, the Senate was
''tearing down the integrity and the independence'' of the judicial
system.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., warned the Republicans that
blocking nominations of a president from the opposite party could
come back to haunt them if a Republican captures the White House.
</P>
<P>
   ''You know, what goes around comes around. You're setting your
president up for this kind of twisting in the wind,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Satellite Privatization Bill OKd  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Legislation intended to begin privatizing the
world's communications satellite network and give U.S. companies
direct access to it passed the House. President Clinton is expected
to sign it into law.
</P>
<P>
   ''This bill gives more competition and choices for Americans in
satellite services,'' said Rep. W.J. ''Billy'' Tauzin, R-La.,
chairman of the House Commerce telecommunications subcommittee.
</P>
<P>
   The bill, which passed the House on a voice vote Thursday, will
allow telephone companies to bypass the Comsat satellite network
and get direct access to the global Intelsat consortium. It also
will allow Comsat to merge with Lockheed Martin Corp., a major
defense contractor.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation, which passed the Senate last week, sets forth
steps for the two intergovernmental satellite consortiums --
Intelsat and Inmarsat -- to follow the road to privatization. If
they do not abide by these criteria, their access to the U.S.
market could be restricted.

<HEADLINE> Fired CIA Agent To Receive Award  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The former chief of the CIA's Latin American
Division, who was fired in 1995 for failing to inform Congress
about human rights abuses in Guatemala, will be awarded one of the
agency's highest honors this month, according to The Washington
Post.
</P>
<P>
   Terry R. Ward, 62, will receive the Distinguished Career
Intelligence Medal on March 23 for ''exceptional achievements''
during a 30-year covert career, the Post reported today.
</P>
<P>
   Ward was fired for failing to report on CIA ties to a Guatemalan
colonel linked to two murders in the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Former colleagues within the CIA's Directorate of Operations
recommended Ward's medal, which was then approved by James Pavitt,
the CIA's deputy director for operations, according to an
unidentified intelligence official cited by the Post.
</P>
<P>
   Former CIA Director John M. Deutch fired Ward.Some human rights
activists and other CIA critics are angry over the agency's
decision to recognize Ward, the Post reported.

<HEADLINE> Cohen Focuses on Stabilizing Asia  </HEADLINE>
By ROBERT BURNS, AP Military Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   HONG KONG (AP) -- On his first visit to this former British
colony since it reverted to Chinese control in 1997, Defense
Secretary William Cohen is stressing the important role the
American military plays in maintaining a balance of power in Asia
at a time of growing tensions between China and Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen arrived here today to prepare for talks Saturday with Tung
Chee-hwa, the Hong Kong chief executive, and other government
officials.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview en route here from Washington, Cohen underscored
the importance of regular port calls to Hong Kong by U.S. Navy
ships -- an arrangement he said benefitted both Washington and Hong
Kong.
</P>
<P>
   Approvals for U.S. ship visits to Hong Kong are Beijing's
prerogative; after the NATO air war against Yugoslavia began last
spring China halted all military contacts with Washington --
including port calls to Hong Kong. But since September all 22 U.S.
requests for ship visits have been approved, a senior U.S. official
said today. The official discussed the matter on condition of
anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen also said he would stress to government officials and
business executives the importance of enforcing stringent export
controls to prevent the transshipment through Hong Kong harbor of
contraband and materials intended for terrorists.
</P>
<P>
   In the interview today, Cohen called for a halt to the war of
words between China and Taiwan and said he hoped to visit Beijing
this summer to urge restraint.
</P>
<P>
   ''Both sides should lower the rhetoric and lower the tension and
then try to work this out in a peaceful fashion rather than one of
intimidation and confrontation,'' the defense secretary told
reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the dangers, Cohen gave no indication he saw an imminent
threat of war.
</P>
<P>
   ''All of the evidence is that the prospect of it escalating to a
military confrontation is not likely,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He also emphasized the importance of restraint by Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   ''We will continue to insist that the Taiwanese pursue
negotiations peacefully and not seek independence, which we do not
support.''
</P>
<P>
   In a later interview today with CNN in Hong Kong, Cohen
dismissed Chinese charges that the United States is to blame for
heightened tensions. China criticized the Pentagon's announcement
this week that it planned to sell more capable Hawk air defense
missiles and a reconfigured radar system to Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   ''For China to suggest that we are somehow at fault really
exaggerates the situation,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen said in the earlier interview that he hoped the
''rhetorical tension'' will subside once Taiwan holds its
presidential election March 18. China sees Taiwan as a renegade
province and has said it cannot rule out using military force if
Taiwan tries to gain independence. Washington recognizes Taiwan as
part of ''one China,'' but it is committed to providing the
weaponry Taiwan needs to defend itself against attack.
</P>
<P>
   In the CNN interview, Cohen recalled that in the weeks leading
up to Taiwan's last presidential election, in 1996, China conducted
live-fire military exercises in the Taiwan Strait and lobbed
missiles in Taiwan's direction.
</P>
<P>
   ''In the past they turned to firing missiles; this time they're
firing words -- a much better situation,'' Cohen said.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration has pursued a series of high-level
visits to Hong Kong to underscore its determination to help Hong
Kong remain as free and open as before the July 1997 reversion to
Chinese rule.
</P>
<P>
   As a special administrative region of China, Hong Kong has a
high degree of autonomy in all matters except foreign and defense
affairs.
</P>
<P>
   After spending the weekend in Hong Kong, Cohen is scheduled to
travel to Vietnam on Monday to become the first American secretary
of defense to visit since the Vietnam War ended in April 1975. He
will be there amid a series of national celebrations over the
communists' defeat of U.S.-backed South Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   In the interview today, Cohen said his visit to Hanoi will be a
good first step toward closer military ties between former enemies.
He also is scheduled to stop in Ho Chi Minh City, formerly known as
Saigon.
</P>
<P>
   ''This may be the beginning of a new relationship as such, a
step-by-step cautious relationship with Vietnam,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> CDC: Winter Flu Season Not Unusual  </HEADLINE>
By JUSTIN BACHMAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA (AP) -- Despite what appeared to be a bad outbreak of the
flu a few months ago -- with crammed hospitals nationwide leading to
fears of an epidemic -- this winter's flu season was no fiercer than
any other the past five years, the government said.
</P>
<P>
   As the flu season peaked during the week ending Dec. 25, many
health professonals said it was the worst outbreak they had seen in
a long time.
</P>
<P>
   However, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported
Thursday that 12,651 people have tested positive for the flu since
Oct. 3.
</P>
<P>
   With the flu season nearing an end, the statistics are in line
with those from the past five years.
</P>
<P>
   The actual number of people with the flu was in the tens of
millions, but the CDC only tracks cases confirmed by tests. Of
those, 99 percent had the type A Sydney strain, which has been the
most common the last three seasons.
</P>
<P>
   About 20,000 Americans die of flu complications every year. And
the CDC said the death toll was probably about the same this year,
though the agency is still studying that.
</P>
<P>
   In two of the past five years, 1995-96 and 1996-97, the season
peaked in mid-December and January. Peaks in the other seasons
occurred in February and early March.
</P>
<P>
   Many people suffering from flu-like symptoms have been infected
with some nasty germ, but probably not one of the four types of
influenza, said Dr. Andrea Winquist with the CDC's National Center
for Infectious Diseases. Many common viruses and bacteria cause
similar symptoms.
</P>
<P>
   ''People tend to use the word 'flu' for a lot of things,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Alan Arvello, a physician's assistant in Amarillo, Texas, said
the clinic where he works was filled from November to January with
people complaining of the flu. He said many learned something else
was causing their misery.
</P>
<P>
   ''A lot of times, once we counsel people, they say, 'Oh OK, I
didn't have the flu,''' Arvello said.
</P>
<P>
   Bronchitis and pneumonia are two ailments that often resemble
the flu and require hospitalization for many people.
</P>
<P>
   The CDC estimates 10 percent to 20 percent of the population
gets the flu every season.

<HEADLINE> Albright Talks to EU, NATO Officers  </HEADLINE>
By JEFFREY ULBRICH, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) -- Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
said today that NATO-led forces were trying to head off a ''hot
spring'' in Kosovo, but the Yugoslav government was inciting
trouble and making the job more difficult.
</P>
<P>
   ''The spring has not always been good for the Balkans,'' she
said. ''We have been consulting on ways to try to lower the
temperature and press extremists not to pursue activities that
complicate the situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Albright, fresh from a two-day look at peacekeeping operations
in Bosnia, came to Brussels to talk about the even thornier subject
of Kosovo with European Union and NATO officials. The explosive
situation in the city of Kosovska Mitrovica, where ethnic Albanians
and Serbs have been clashing with each other and with peacekeepers,
is of particular concern.
</P>
<P>
   After a meeting with Romano Prodi, president of the European
Commission -- the executive arm of the EU -- Albright said she was
not giving up on diplomacy.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is very important not to get ahead of ourselves here,'' she
said. ''We have been talking both to the Albanians and various
Serbs, but the truth is there are extremists that need to know that
this is not a solution to any problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Without directly citing Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic,
Albright said ''there is one government, however, that is stirring
things up that concerns us. We want Mitrovica dealt with in a fair
way, not as a partitioned city, where there is respect for minority
rights.''
</P>
<P>
   With 20,000 NATO-led troops in Bosnia and 37,000 in Kosovo, the
United States and its European allies have their hands full in the
Balkans. While Bosnia has largely stabilized, allowing NATO to
reduce its original 60,000-soldier force by two-thirds, Kosovo
remains explosive, a political settlement with Serbia a distant
dream.
</P>
<P>
   Prodi said he and Albright discussed Europe's candidate to head
the International Monetary Fund, but had made no decision.
Washington rejected Europe's first candidate, German Deputy Finance
Minister Caio Koch-Weser. Germany has put forward another
candidate, Horst Koehler, currently head of the European Bank for
Reconstruction and Development.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have said the U.S. is for a European candidate who has
strong qualifications,'' Albright said.
</P>
<P>
   Albright was to meet later with Javier Solana, chief of the EU's
foreign and security policy, and with NATO Secretary-General Lord
Robertson.
</P>
<P>
   The EU decided at its December summit in Helsinki, Finland to
establish a 50,000- to 60,000-strong rapid reaction force capable
of deploying within 60 days and sustaining itself for up to a year.
This force, to be ready by 2003, would allow Europeans to take
action outside the NATO framework in cases where the United States
does not wish to get involved.
</P>
<P>
   Solana said the aim of the EU is to equip itself ''to respond
effectively to international crises using all the tools at its
disposal: diplomacy, economic measures, humanitarian assistance
and, ultimately, the use of military forces.''
</P>
<P>
   Last spring's air war against Yugoslavia showed the huge gaps in
military capability between the United States and Europe, serious
shortcomings that the allies pledged at their own summit last
spring to overcome.
</P>
<P>
   The situation in Kosovo remains daunting. Clark has complained
that the European allies are not sticking to their troop
commitments. Particularly in view of recent civil disturbances in
the town of Kosovska Mitrovica, Clark wants the force built back to
its original strength of just under 50,000. Some allies have
allowed force levels to drop, giving commanders several thousand
fewer troops.

<HEADLINE> PM-CT--Officer on Trial,1st Ld-Writethru,550  </HEADLINE>
By DIANE SCARPONI, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LITCHFIELD, Conn. (AP) -- No one disputes that New Milford Police
Officer Scott Smith shot and killed Franklyn Reid after a foot
chase in December, 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Now, a jury must decide if the shooting amounted to murder,
manslaughter or self defense.
</P>
<P>
   Jury deliberations are scheduled to resume today. The jury
deliberated about 2{ hours Thursday, then asked to rehear the
testimony of eight witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   Superior Court Judge Charles Gill told they jury they could also
consider charges of intentional manslaughter or reckless
manslaughter in the death of Reid, 27.
</P>
<P>
   The additional charges came over the objections of Smith's
lawyer. Smith, 27, has claimed he shot in self-defense -- a defense
that would apply to any of the charges he faces.
</P>
<P>
   Smith is the first officer in Connecticut history to be
prosecuted for murder for an on-duty shooting.
</P>
<P>
   In closing arguments Thursday, Waterbury State's Attorney John
Connelly urged jurors to consider the testimony of several
eyewitnesses over the testimony of Smith and his coworkers.
</P>
<P>
   At the time of the shooting, Reid was wanted for failing to
appear in court. He had led police on a short foot chase along
Route 202 before the shooting.
</P>
<P>
   ''Running from police doesn't carry with it the death penalty.
Failure to appear in court doesn't mean the death penalty,'' said
Connelly, who is acting as special prosecutor in the case.
</P>
<P>
   Defense attorney Jack Kelly said Smith was doing his job and
trying not to get killed.
</P>
<P>
   ''The state says Scott Smith conducted a public execution of
Franklyn Reid for no reason -- that's the only conclusion you can
come to if you accept the state's theory,'' Kelly said.
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses reported seeing Smith chase Reid. One witness said he
saw Smith draw his gun and saw Reid sitting down. Another testified
that Smith's foot was on Reid's back just before the shooting.
</P>
<P>
   Evidence from Reid's clothes and autopsy back up this version of
events and contradict Smith's claim that Reid was on his knees and
possibly reaching for a weapon when he fired, Connelly said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Officer Smith let his emotions take over, and because of that,
Franklyn Reid is dead,'' Connelly said in an hour-long argument to
the jury of seven men and five women.
</P>
<P>
   Connelly accused fellow New Milford officers and medical
technicians of changing or omitting facts from their stories to
help Smith's case.
</P>
<P>
   Smith's partner testified he did not see the shooting. An
emergency medical technician who is Smith's neighbor testified he
moved a jacket out of the way to help Reid, but did not mention the
jacket in his initial statement.
</P>
<P>
   Reid was unarmed, but a short folding knife was discovered in
the pocket of the nearby jacket.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly said Smith was a well-trained officer who struggled with
Reid and had reason to fear for his life. Reid was a strong,
violent person who had gone to prison for stabbing someone, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Smith, who took the stand in his own defense earlier this week,
said Reid was twisting around and reaching around his waist. Smith
said he feared Reid had a weapon.
</P>
<P>
   ''Did Scott Smith have to wait for Franklyn Reid to get ahold of
his knife and try to use it on him?'' Kelly asked the jury during
his 50-minute closing argument.

<HEADLINE> Hepatitis, Injection Program Linked  </HEADLINE>
By EMMA ROSS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- Scientists have found the strongest link yet
between Egypt's unusually high prevalence of hepatitis C and a mass
injection program conducted 20 or 30 years ago to treat
schistosomiasis, a waterborne tropical disease caused by a
parasite.
</P>
<P>
   Egypt has a high rate of liver disease, mostly due to chronic
infection with the hepatitis C virus, which can go unnoticed until
decades after the infection, when liver damage becomes evident.
Hepatitis C is easily spread through blood contact.
</P>
<P>
   About 15-20 percent of the population in Egypt has hepatitis C
antibodies, according to a study published this week in The Lancet
medical journal. That compares to a hepatitis C infection rate of
about 1.5 percent in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The study of 8,499 people found that within all regions of the
country, the prevalence of hepatitis changed most dramatically
between those who were old enough to have participated in the mass
injection program, and those who were too young to have been
exposed to it and were instead treated with pills.
</P>
<P>
   Liver experts have noted the link before, but the latest study
provides the strongest evidence yet to explain the hepatitis
epidemic in Egypt.
</P>
<P>
   ''It wasn't the schistosomiasis drug, it was contamination of
the injection equipment,'' said Christina Frank, an epidemiologist
at the University of Maryland who led the study. ''In those days
they used reusable needles and syringes, not sterile. They didn't
know that boiling them for two minutes was not enough.''
</P>
<P>
   The Egyptian Ministry of Health and Population and the World
Health Organization were also involved in the study.
</P>
<P>
   The findings help explain the origin of similar hepatitis C
outbreaks elsewhere in the world, said Dr. David Thomas, an
infectious disease specialist at Johns Hopkins University, who was
not connected with the research.
</P>
<P>
   The Egyptians should not be accused of any past sloppiness,
Frank said, because at the time the injection program was running,
scientists did not know what they know today about how to sterilize
equipment properly and the danger of exposure to blood.
</P>
<P>
   Egypt is a unique case when it comes to hepatitis because it
had, and still has, one of the highest incidences of
schistosomiasis and was one of the few countries afflicted with the
disease that had the money to initiate a mass treatment program,
Frank said.

   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP)-- A new poll suggests that most people
believe police officers who use deadly force should face criminal
charges under some circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   The Hartford Courant/Connecticut poll released today found 56
percent believe that police officers who use deadly force out of
fear for their lives, should be charged with crimes if it later
turns out there was no tangible threat.
</P>
<P>
   The 56 percent backing charges said officers in such cases
should not be charged with murder. The poll shows 17 percent
believe punishing an officer on a murder charge is the appropriate
action.
</P>
<P>
   Fourteen percent think police in such cases should not be
punished at all.
</P>
<P>
   The poll focused on some of the issues facing New Milford police
Officer Scott Smith who has been on trial on a murder charge in the
fatal shooting of a suspect, Franklyn Reid in December 1998
following a foot chase.
</P>
<P>
   The telephone poll of 509 randomly selected state residents was
conducted from Feb. 23 to March 1 by the Center for Survey Research
and Analysis at the University of Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   The poll has a margin of error of plus or minus five percentage
points.

<TEXT>
<P>
   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) -- As state lawmakers consider legislation
that could cap the price of prescription drugs in Connecticut, a
scientist with Pfizer Inc. warned such laws could cripple the
industry's ability to develop life-saving drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Claudia R. Turner, an asthma researcher for Pfizer, testified
Thursday before the Legislature's Public Health Committee. She said
pricing caps could lead the company to cut funds for research and
development.
</P>
<P>
   Pfizer currently employs about 4,500 people in Groton at its
headquarters for its research and development division. The company
is also in the process of building a $270 million office building
in New London, where it will house drug development operations.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are on the threshold of what could be the golden age of
biomedical research,'' Turner said. ''But to realize these benefits
and to realize the quality of jobs and opportunities that are part
of Connecticut's vision for leadership in global biotech, we must
maintain a sustained commitment to research and development.''
</P>
<P>
   The legislation is modeled on a bill that passed the Vermont
State Senate last week. It would establish a prescription fairness
review board with the ability to establish maximum prices on drugs
sold in Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   Vermont's senate president pro tempore, Peter Shumlin, came down
from Montpelier to testify in favor of the bill. He said residents
in his state often cross the border to Canada where they can get
drugs at a 50 percent discount.
</P>
<P>
   He presented the committee with some price comparisons of
popular medications. For example, Claritin, a widely prescribed
antihistamine, costs $2.47 retail per pill in Vermont, compared to
80 cents per pill in Canada. Nolvadex, an anti-estrogen used to
treat breast cancer costs $2.15 per pill in Vermont, compared to 29
cents per pill in Canada, the state's Joint Fiscal Office
determined.
</P>
<P>
   Shumlin said that U.S. consumers are picking up the cost of such
research, while the rest of the world benefits from low prices.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are the laughing stock of the Western world,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The bill up for debate also requires Connecticut to join a
consortium of New England states to determine how best to lower
prices through group purchases. Attorney General Richard Blumenthal
said the concept could help reduce the price of prescription drugs
in Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   Another proposal before the legislature's Human Services
Committee establishes a task force to study issues relating to
prescription drug expenditures.
</P>
<P>
   The group would hold public hearings and examine various issues
such as price controls and bulk purchasing, and report any findings
to the General Assembly. Pharmaceutical industry representatives
said Thursday they favor such a task force being formed.

<HEADLINE> Tokyo Governor Defends Bank Tax Plan  </HEADLINE>
By GINNY PARKER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO (AP) -- Tokyo governor Shintaro Ishihara defended on Friday
his plan to tax banks to raise cash for the capital's depleted
coffers, which critics say could stifle economic recovery.
</P>
<P>
   ''Tokyo doesn't have much money, so I had to look for a unique
source of income,'' Ishihara said at a news conference after
jokingly introducing himself as ''the banks' arch-enemy.''
</P>
<P>
   He wants about 30 top banks to pay a combined total of about
$1.03 billion more in taxes annually starting April 1, when the new
fiscal year begins.
</P>
<P>
   The financial industry, regulators and the central government
say Ishihara is unfairly singling out banks and threatening the
industry's comeback from years of deep financial troubles.
</P>
<P>
   But Ishihara says he needs money to shore up the city's
finances. Japan's capital is facing a $6.4 billion budget deficit
at a time the country's economic slowdown is cutting into tax
revenues.
</P>
<P>
   The banking sector is overcoming a massive bad-debt crisis with
the help of a huge public bailout.
</P>
<P>
   Most major banks have not been paying corporate taxes over the
past two or three years because of losses linked to their writing
off of bad loans.
</P>
<P>
   ''If this were going to hurt the nation, I wouldn't go through
with it,'' Ishihara said. ''But this won't damage banks or the
country's financial system.''
</P>
<P>
   The proposal is expected to be approved at the end of this month
since it has the backing of all the main parties in the Tokyo
assembly.
</P>
<P>
   Since his election in April, the author and former transport
minister has distinguished himself by loudly challenging the
central government.
</P>
<P>
   Ishihara is perhaps best known in the rest of the world for his
1989 book, ''The Japan That Can Say No,'' in which he calls on his
country to stand up to the United States on trade and other issues.
</P>
<P>
   An active campaigner against air pollution, he has proposed
regulations that would require trucking companies to cut harmful
emissions from diesel engines.
</P>
<P>
   He has also suggested taxing car owners to reduce the number of
vehicles on the city's clogged roads.
</P>
<P>
   Air pollution is especially bad in the capital because the city
is not ringed by an outer expressway, so chemical-spewing vehicles
rumble straight through its heart, he said Friday.

<HEADLINE> Medicare Losses Totaled $13.5B  </HEADLINE>
By KAREN GULLO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Medicare program losses -- money wasted through
fraud, mistakes and other problems -- inched up to $13.5 billion in
1999 after falling for two consecutive years, government auditors
reported.
</P>
<P>
   The figure means that nearly 8 cents out of every dollar paid by
Medicare last year was wasted. The program paid out $169.5 billion
last year.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, the program lost 7 cents on every dollar, or about
$12.6 billion.
</P>
<P>
   But with losses in previous years coming in at $20 billion or
more, the 1999 figures are evidence that Medicare's seven-year
program to combat fraud and fix mistakes is having an impact, the
program's top official said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The error rate plateau shows that our actions have achieved
sustainable improvement,'' said Nancy-Ann Min DeParle,
administrator of the Health Care Financing Administration, which
runs Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   She said 1999's losses are not much worse, statistically
speaking, than 1998's because they are based on randomly selected
claims that may have had a higher dollar value in 1999 purely by
chance.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, said the agency needs to do more to
cut losses.
</P>
<P>
   ''With all of its available resources, the government should be
able to stop this milking of the Treasury,'' Grassley said.
</P>
<P>
   One troubling finding in the 1999 audit was a big increase in
documentation errors -- one of the most pervasive problems in the
program.
</P>
<P>
   Documentation errors -- when there's little or no paperwork to
determine whether services billed for were actually performed --
caused $5.5 billion in losses. In 1998, those losses were $2.1
billion.
</P>
<P>
   DeParle said HFCA is testing new documentation guidelines and is
expanding education programs to help providers file claims
correctly.
</P>
<P>
   Auditors with the Department of Health and Human Services
Inspector General's office reviewed 5,223 claims from 1999 valued
at $5.4 million. Of those, they found problems with 1,034.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, the first year the comprehensive Medicare audit was
done, overpayments accounted for 14 cents of every dollar spent, or
$23 billion. In 1997, 11 cents on the dollar, or $20 billion, was
lost.
</P>
<P>
   Inspector General June Gibbs Brown also renewed an offer on
Thursday to go easy on health care providers who voluntarily
confess to fraud or billing mistakes, pledging not to kick them out
of Medicare if they can show they have fixed the problems.
</P>
<P>
   ''We want to encourage providers to come forward and disclose
conduct that threatens federal health care programs,'' Brown said
in a letter to providers. A leniency program for those who turn
themselves in began in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The 1999 Medicare audit showed that documentation errors
occurred mostly at home health agencies, medical equipment
suppliers and doctors' offices.
</P>
<P>
   Documentation errors and medically unnecessary procedures have
accounted for $54.8 billion, or 70 percent of the $69.5 billion in
improper payments made during the four years that HHS has been
tracking Medicare's error rates, auditors estimate.

<HEADLINE> Nasdaq Finishes Over 5,000  </HEADLINE>
By EILEEN GLANTON, AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- In the latest sign of investors' frenzy for
technology, the Nasdaq composite index vaulted past 5,000 slightly
more than two months after it first topped 4,000.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq's stunning gains this year, and its seemingly
unstoppable velocity, have confirmed the index as the
top-performing and fastest-growing barometer of the U.S. stock
market.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq Stock Market launched the composite index 29 years
ago as a way to measure the progress of fledgling companies too
small or weak for the prestigious New York Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, the index crossed 5,000 for the first time after
soaring 149.60 points Thursday to at 5,046.86. This morning, the
Nasdaq rose 12.79 to 5,059.65 in early trading, but many analysts
were expecting investors to sell shares to lock in profits from its
steep run.
</P>
<P>
   The index is now up 24 percent for the year, compared with a 13
percent loss for its blue-chip counterpart, the Dow Jones
industrial average. The Nasdaq's velocity is unmatched, as well; it
took the Dow nearly nine months to rise from 4,000 and 5,000 in
1995.
</P>
<P>
   While many Wall Street pros insist that round numbers like 5,000
hold no special significance, the Nasdaq's rapid growth has left
some slightly awestruck.
</P>
<P>
   ''The move up has been nothing short of scintillating,'' said
Hugh Johnson, chief investment officer at First Albany Corp.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq Stock Market began trading on Feb. 8, 1971. It was
the world's first electronic market, where traders posted their
prices on computer screens instead of haggling on a trading floor.
The new market's name, the National Association of Securities
Dealers Automated Quotation system, came from the self-regulatory
security industry group that created it.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq composite index was set up to measure all of the new
market's companies, which at the time numbered 2,500. Now about
5,000 companies trade on the Nasdaq.
</P>
<P>
   For years, most companies that grew large enough to meet the
NYSE's more stringent listing requirements moved there,
contributing to Nasdaq's longtime reputation as a second-tier
index.
</P>
<P>
   But in recent years, one-time upstarts like Microsoft and Intel
who grew into corporate mammoths chose to stay put, even as their
market capitalizations -- the total dollar value of their shares --
soared. Last year, those two technology bellwethers were added to
the Dow Jones industrial average -- the first two Nasdaq stocks to
join the prestigious list of 30 companies.
</P>
<P>
   The shining performance of the Nasdaq has provided the only real
light for investors this year. The market is constantly expanding
with new stocks that tap into investor obsession with anything
having to do with computers, telecommunications, biotechnology and,
of course, the Internet -- all of which have come symbolize the
''new economy.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, most other stocks have been stuck in a narrow range,
hemmed in by worries about inflation and rising interest rates.
Blue-chip stocks -- the manufacturers, transportation, financial and
other companies of the ''old economy'' -- have been especially
moribund.
</P>
<P>
   On the surface, the Nasdaq's leap from 4,000 to 5,000 looks much
like its jump from 3,000 to 4,000. The index crossed its latest
thousand-point milestone in 46 trading sessions, compared with 39
sessions between 3,000 and 4,000.
</P>
<P>
   Both advances came in narrow markets, with a relative handful of
stocks contributing most of the gains. And both advances featured
fierce volatility, indicating to most market watchers that
short-term traders were largely responsible for the Nasdaq's
growing dominance.
</P>
<P>
   But there are some significant differences.
</P>
<P>
   First off, the large-capitalization companies that led the
Nasdaq's push to 4,000 have cooled a bit. Instead, investors are
seeking out new opportunities in the semiconductor and
biotechnology sectors. Human Genome Sciences, which uses genetic
research to develop drugs, has more than doubled since the start of
the year and now trades over $177 a share.
</P>
<P>
   More fundamentally, investors have embraced technology stocks as
the companies most likely to succeed if the Federal Reserve
continues raising interest rates to cool the fast-growing economy
and prevent inflation. That's a dramatic change from last year,
when many investors feared that younger tech companies would be
crippled by higher interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is now a belief that technology stocks are immune to
swings in interest rates and the business cycle in general,''
Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   That's because technology carries the promise of helping all
types of companies improve productivity, analysts said. Also these
companies don't depend as much on borrowing from banks to develop
their businesses, relying more on investors and venture
capitalists.
</P>
<P>
   ''Productivity is key to improving real standards of living and
keeping inflation at bay,'' said James M. Griffin Jr., chief
investment strategist at Aeltus Investment Management in Hartford,
Conn.
</P>
<P>
   Yet despite the vast promise of technology, many investors
remain leery of the sector. With their lofty valuations and
sometimes scant earnings, the stocks are prone to wild swings and
aren't for every investor.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Fertman, a 33-year-old New Yorker, said that while he owns
technology stocks, he remains fearful of their valuations.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a bubble that's about to burst,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Professional investors are nervous, too.
</P>
<P>
   ''I own them all,'' said Johnson ''They have made the difference
in my portfolios' performance. So I'm very grateful for their
extraordinary performance, but I'm also scared stiff.''

<HEADLINE> Surprise Resignation Hurts Wolters  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) -- Shares of the Dutch publisher
Wolters Kluwer took a nosedive Friday after its chairman
unexpectedly stepped down and the company issued a flat two-year
profit forecast.
</P>
<P>
   The firm indicated in a statement that Caspar van Kempen's
resignation, effective immediately, was the result of a boardroom
battle. Deputy chairman Robert Pieterse was named as his
replacement.
</P>
<P>
   The company said van Kempen resigned due to ''differences with
his executive board colleagues over business strategies.''
</P>
<P>
   Wolters Kluwer shares went into a downward spiral, tumbling 25
percent on the Amsterdam exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts were taken aback by the resignation and the
announcement that profit growth would be flat in 2000 and 2001
following 16 percent growth in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ''We had the impression that all noses were pointing in the same
direction,'' said Reinier Westeneng, an analyst at SNS Securities.
''If there's disagreement at the top, that's not a good thing.''
</P>
<P>
   The announcements came as Wolters also reported higher earnings
for 1999. Profit after amortization of goodwill rose to $343
million from $297 million a year earlier, while per share earnings
rose to $1.24 from $1.08.
</P>
<P>
   Revenues were $2.96 billion compared to $2.63 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Wolters Kluwer said it would inject $240 million into Internet
ventures in the coming years. The funding will come from internal
cash flows and the sale of non-core assets, it said.
</P>
<P>
   The Amsterdam-based company focuses on legal, tax and business
publishing, with its largest markets in the Netherlands and other
European countries.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Worries Over Madagascar Cholera  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   GENEVA (AP) -- A cholera outbreak in Madagascar is causing
increased concern following torrential rains caused by a tropical
storm, U.N. officials said today.
</P>
<P>
   The Indian Ocean island, which was free of cholera for several
decades until March 1999, has seen some 22,600 suspected cases of
the disease since then, said World Health Organization spokesman
Gregory Hartl. More than 1,300 people have died, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Half the cases and the deaths have come in the last two months,
Hartl said, noting that cholera is easily treatable if rapid action
is taken.
</P>
<P>
   ''The case fatality rate should be less than 1 percent for
cholera,'' he said. ''At the moment, in Madagascar it's above 5
percent.''
</P>
<P>
   The rains that have flooded the southeast African country of
Mozambique in recent weeks have also affected nearby Madagascar,
and the WHO noted an increased risk of the waterborne disease
spreading because of poor sanitation and the possibility of safe
water being contaminated by waste.
</P>
<P>
   World Food Program spokeswoman Christiane Berthiaume said the
cholera outbreak, along with a food shortage, is a ''serious
threat.''
</P>
<P>
   In Mozambique, official figures showed 1,170 cholera cases from
the beginning of this year through March 5, according to WHO. Less
than 1 percent of those infected have died.
</P>
<P>
   About 1,000 cases were reported in the central Sofala province
and the rest in the capital, Maputo.
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. Children's Fund said disruption caused by new rains in
Mozambique has forced it to postpone an immunization push for
measles, meningitis and tetanus that was planned for this week.
</P>
<P>
   The effort should now start Tuesday, spokeswoman Lyn Geldof
said. UNICEF is targeting 65,000 children under 5, made homeless by
the floods, for measles inoculation and to give them vitamin A.
</P>
<P>
   It plans to immunize 75,000 women under 45 against tetanus.
About 300,000 people of all ages are to be vaccinated against
meningitis.
</P>
<P>
   UNICEF also is overseeing the spraying of houses, tents and
schools against malaria-carrying mosquitoes, Geldof said.

<HEADLINE> Dow Gains 32; Nasdaq Rises 30  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- The Nasdaq composite index extended its gains
today on the strength of technology stocks, while old-line
industrial shares were held to modest gains.
</P>
<P>
   In the first hour of trading on Wall Street, the Nasdaq was up
30.11 at 5,076.97.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were also higher. The Dow Jones
industrial average was up 32.88 to 10,043.61, and the Standard &AMP;
Poor's 500 index was up 6.28 to 1,407.97.
</P>
<P>
   Dell Computer rose 2 9/16 to 53 after PaineWebber raised its
rating on the stock to ''buy.'' A PaineWebber analyst said Dell, a
personal computer maker, is well-positioned to take advantage of
heavy demand for technology used for the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Telecommunications companies also drove the Nasdaq higher.
Tellabs was up 3\ at 57~ and Global Crossing was up 3 9/16 to 58}.
</P>
<P>
   While the Nasdaq's gains were somewhat modest, there it did not

	   ROCHESTER, N.Y. (AP) -- Two teen-age boys were shot to death in
an execution-style attack that bore the hallmarks of a drug deal
gone awry, police said.
</P>
<P>
   A passer-by came upon the bodies of Melvin Chatman, 16, and
Raymond Hernandez, 18, lying in the vestibule of an apartment
building in northwest Rochester and called 911 around 5:15 a.m.
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   An autopsy showed that each died of a single gunshot wound to
the head.
</P>
<P>
   The Rochester teens were shot execution-style at close range,
police said. Neighbors said they had heard gunshots a couple of
hours earlier but no one alerted police.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was clearly an execution and there's little doubt it was
drug-related,'' police Chief Robert Duffy said. ''This was not a
random act.''
</P>
<P>
   The building where the bodies were found was known for drug
dealing, Duffy said. Police had no suspects and few leads.

<HEADLINE> Deutsche Telekom Ends Qwest Talks  </HEADLINE>
By NOELLE KNOX, AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Deutsche Telekom AG abruptly ended talks to
acquire two Denver-based telecommunications companies, Qwest
Communications Inc. and U S West Inc.
</P>
<P>
   The failed negotiations appeared to have put increasing strain
on Qwest's current agreement to acquire U S West for $50 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Qwest on Thursday blamed U S West for pushing away Deutsche
Telekom. Although Qwest did not name Deutsche Telekom as the
suitor, people familiar with the negotiations confirmed the German
telephone company met with executives of both U S West and Qwest to
discuss a three-way deal.
</P>
<P>
   ''We regret that U S West apparently wouldn't even consider an
alternative transaction involving'' Deutsche Telekom, Joseph P.
Nacchio, chairman and CEO of Qwest, said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   U S West, a Baby Bell that provides phone service in 14 states,
said it would only enter into an agreement if it did not jeopardize
or delay its merger with Qwest, and if the new offer was equal or
better to the offer from Qwest.
</P>
<P>
   But today Nacchio said new state regulatory hurdles will delay
his plans to acquire U S West. If Qwest, a long-distance carrier
focusing on Internet traffic, does not complete its acquisition of
U S West by the end of the year, their pact expires.
</P>
<P>
   ''This merger will close if we're lucky in the third quarter,''
he said. He had said just weeks ago that the deal would close
mid-year.
</P>
<P>
   The chairman of the Federal Communications Commission, William
Kennard, said today federal approval of the Qwest-U S West merger
was imminent, provided the companies sell certain long-distance
operations.
</P>
<P>
   Deutsche Telekom refused to comment today on what it called
market rumors.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have several irons in the fire, but we never name names.
But we are still continuing our path seeking internationalization
partners. We are not under time pressure to do anything,''
spokesman Hans Ehnert said.
</P>
<P>
   A call to a spokesman at U S West was not immediately returned
today.
</P>
<P>
   Qwest started negotiating with Deutsche Telekom weeks ago --
behind the back of U S West. Last week, U S West executives
threatened to sue Qwest if Qwest tried to back out of their deal.
</P>
<P>
   The friction between Qwest and U S West appeared to ease over
the weekend after Qwest said it would only agree to an offer that
included U S West.
</P>
<P>
   But U S West's hardline on negotiations with Deutsche Telekom
has increased the tension between U S West and Qwest.
</P>
<P>
   Nacchio said today that U S West's stand was ''nothing short of
amazing,'' adding that the events of the past few weeks were among
''the most bizarre things that I have been through.''
</P>
<P>
   Qwest's shares slid 11 percent, or $6.18}, to $51 this morning
on the New York Stock Exchange, where shares of U S West were down
10 percent, or $7.25, at $68.50. Deutsche Telekom's U.S. shares
were up 62{ cents at $93.68}.

<HEADLINE> GOPer Backs Clinton on Colombia Aid  </HEADLINE>
By ALAN FRAM, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A senior Republican congressman offered an
impassioned defense today of President Clinton's proposed anti-drug
aid package for Colombia, saying the fate of ''every school,
hospital, courtroom, neighborhood and police station across
America'' is at stake.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Benjamin Gilman of New York, chairman of the House
International Relations Committee, said Colombia is the source of
80 percent of the cocaine and 75 percent of the heroin entering the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   ''We cannot afford not to act,'' Gilman said in a speech
prepared for delivery to the Heritage Foundation, a conservative
research group.
</P>
<P>
   Gilman spoke a day after the proposed $1.7 billion aid
counternarcotics plan for Colombia and other Andean countries was
approved by the House Appropriations Committee.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal is part of a $9 billion measure that will be taken
up by the House, possibly next week, after being approved 33-13 by
the committee on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Gilman rejected the argument of some critics that the aid plan,
which consists primarily of military equipment for counterdrug
efforts, could land the United States in a Vietnam-style quagmire.
</P>
<P>
   He cited a recent quote from Ralph Peters, of the Office of
National Drug Control Policy: ''The greatest difference between
Vietnam and Colombia is, paradoxically, that Colombia matters
strategically and immediately to the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   The prospects for the $9 billion measure are brighter in the
House than in the Senate, where GOP leaders have shown little
enthusiasm for the legislation.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, the committee voted 36-20 to reject an effort by
Rep. David Obey, D-Wis., to withhold $552 million of the Colombia
aid money. It also used a mostly party-line 31-23 vote to reject an
effort by Rep. Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., to add $1.3 billion for drug
treatment and prevention programs in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ''If anyone thinks drug use in the United States is not
emergency status, you better think again,'' said Rep. Sonny
Callahan, R-Ala.
</P>
<P>
   But Obey and others argued that the United States risks a
costly, 10-year involvement in Colombia, where a decades-long civil
war already has taken 35,000 lives. Colombia has become the world's
top cocaine producer, and efforts by Bogota to stop the traffickers
have so far produced scant results.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't see why we should be embarking on a campaign that will
be highly expensive and could lead to a lot of other problems,''
Obey said.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to committee leaders, White House budget chief Jack
Lew lauded lawmakers' ''timely support,'' saying it would ''help to
stem the flow of drugs into the United States and will further
benefit the United States by bringing greater peace and prosperity
to an important ally.''
</P>
<P>
   The aid to Colombia includes money to supply 63 helicopters,
train and equip Colombian troops and police, strengthen human
rights efforts and persuade coca farmers to grow other crops.
Included are small amounts of aid for Peru, Bolivia and Ecuador.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to opposition by some Democrats to the Colombia
package, many conservatives say the overall bill is too expensive.
The $9 billion bill is almost double the $5.2 billion Clinton
requested, and it is almost entirely paid for out of the budget
surplus.
</P>
<P>
   The bill also includes:
</P>
<P>
   --$2.2 billion for recovery from last fall's Hurricane Floyd and
other disasters. Clinton has proposed $1.2 billion. The extra money
includes $7 million to combat Pierce's disease, which is hurting
Southern California farms, and $40 million to help Florida
producers of lime and other crops damaged by the citrus canker.
</P>
<P>
   --All $2 billion Clinton wants for the costs of American forces
in Kosovo, and the $25 million for U.S. operations in East Timor.
</P>
<P>
   --$1.6 billion to cover the Pentagon's higher fuel bill caused by
rising oil prices and $854 million to bolster the Defense
Department's health insurance program. Clinton asked for neither.
</P>
<P>
   --$104 million to build a new U.S. embassy in Sarajevo, Bosnia.
But it ignores the additional $135 million Clinton requested for
new diplomatic buildings in Pristina, Kosovo, and in Tirana,
Albania.
</P>
<P>
   --$40 million Clinton wants to help residents near the Vieques,
Puerto Rico, firing range used by the Navy.

<HEADLINE> House Boosts Minimum Wage by $1  </HEADLINE>
By CURT ANDERSON, AP Tax Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Now that the House has passed a $1 increase in
the minimum wage over two years combined with $122 billion in
business tax cuts, negotiators will have to sort things out with
the Senate's $1 wage boost over three years and different tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton, meanwhile, says he'll veto any minimum wage
bill if it includes a large tax relief package that uses too much
of the projected federal budget surplus. Today, he again appealed
for a ''simple and clear'' minimum wage proposal, and said he had
received encouraging signs that an agreement might happen.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm going to keep working on it,'' Clinton said. ''I think the
American people question why Congress can't do something as simple
as raising the minimum wage without loading it up with special
favors.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though most Democrats support raising the $5.15-an-hour
wage to $6.15 over two years, the president immediately denounced
the legislation passed Thursday night by the House because of the
''risky tax giveaways'' he contends would jeopardize Social
Security and Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   ''Once again, Republicans in the House of Representatives have
demonstrated that they would rather fight for special interests
than give working families the raise they deserve,'' Clinton said
in a written statement. ''Congress should send me a bill I can
sign: a clean, straightforward bill that raises the minimum wage by
a dollar over two years.''
</P>
<P>
   The House voted 246-179 for a bipartisan amendment boosting the
wage by $1 over two years -- a $2,000 raise for a full-time worker --
instead of a GOP plan for the same raise over three years. The
rewritten bill then passed 282-143.
</P>
<P>
   ''Three years is simply too long to phase in a minimum wage
increase,'' said Rep. Jim Traficant, D-Ohio, a main sponsor. ''An
increase of $1 over two years will have an immediate positive
impact on thousands of families.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, the House voted 257-169 for the GOP tax bill that
Clinton opposes, two-thirds of it cuts in estate taxes. Republican
leaders then combined the tax and wage measures into one bill.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate has passed a three-year, $1 increase in the minimum
wage and its own tax package as part of a bill to make it harder
for people to escape credit card and other debts in bankruptcy
court. Differences in the Senate and House measures will have to be
worked out before a bill is sent to Clinton, but many lawmakers
were optimistic for compromise before Congress adjourns for the
fall elections.
</P>
<P>
   ''It will pass. They're not going to leave here without a
minimum wage bill,'' said House Minority Whip David Bonior, D-Mich.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate Democratic leader, Sen. Tom Daschle of South Dakota,
told reporters today that Democrats would push for a two-year wage
increase and a much more modest tax package than either of the
current House or Senate bills, goals he said Congress should reach
this year.
</P>
<P>
   ''Democrats will have a vote on the minimum wage this year, one
way or another,'' he said. ''I think it's critical that we do it
soon.''
</P>
<P>
   Although a majority of Republicans oppose raising the minimum
wage, GOP leaders wanted to give Northeastern Republican moderates
an opportunity to vote for an increase and deny the Democrats their
own bill. The GOP hoped the vote would defuse the issue in the
November congressional elections.
</P>
<P>
   Many Democrats said the increase was long past due, asserting
that average pay for corporate chief executive officers has risen
some 750 percent since 1980, compared with only 68 percent for the
average worker. About 4 million workers are paid the minimum wage.
</P>
<P>
   The House measure calls for a 50-cent increase in the minimum
wage in April of this year, followed by another 50 cents in April
2001. It is unlikely, however, that the legislation will become law
by April and there has been no talk of making it retroactive.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate bill would increase the wage by 35 cents this year,
by 35 cents more in March 2001 and 30 cents in March 2002. The
Senate tax package totals $103 billion over 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   Although Democrats claim the House tax bill favors the wealthy,
Republicans contended it would properly offset the costs to
business of raising the minimum wage, which many in the GOP view as
a job-killer and hindrance to new investment or expansion.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our point is simply, let's find some tax relief to cushion the
blow,'' said Rep. Rob Portman, R-Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the debate centered on the estate tax cuts. Costing
$78.6 billion over 10 years, they were portrayed by Democrats as a
giveaway primarily for people with incomes over $319,000 a year.
Democrats were prevented from offering their own, smaller tax
package for small business.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're not fighting any tax relief. We're fighting for the
right kind of tax relief,'' said Rep. Sander Levin, D-Mich.
</P>
<P>
   GOP sponsors said current estate taxes prevent small businesses
and family farms from being passed down to heirs and require costly
tax planning simply to ease the impact.

   CHICAGO (AP) -- Grain and soybean futures edged lower in early
dealings today on the Chicago Board of Trade, buffeted by wet
weather systems in both North and South America.

<P>
   Soybeans, still carrying downward momentum from Thursday's weak
close, were pressured by crop-beneficial rains expected in key
growing regions of Brazil and Argentina this weekend.

Department of Agriculture, including an increase of 20 million
bushels in U.S. exports.
</P>
<P>
   Corn drifted marginally lower after the USDA's supply-and-demand
report made no changes to the overall outlook for that commodity.

<HEADLINE> Nasdaq, Dow Extend Gains  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- The Nasdaq composite index extended its gains
today on the strength of technology stocks, while old-line
industrial shares were held to modest gains.
</P>
<P>
   In late morning on Wall Street, the Nasdaq was up 73.51 at
5,120.37.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were also higher. The Dow Jones
industrial average was up 51.81 to 10,062.54, and the Standard &AMP;
Poor's 500 index was up 8.61 at 1,410.30.
</P>
<P>
   Dell Computer rose 3 1/16 to 53{ after PaineWebber raised its
rating on the stock to ''buy.'' A PaineWebber analyst said Dell, a
personal computer maker, is well-positioned to take advantage of
heavy demand for technology used for the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Telecommunications companies also drove the Nasdaq higher.
Tellabs was up 2~ at 57{ and Global Crossing was up 4 at 59 3/16.
</P>
<P>
   While the Nasdaq's gains were somewhat modest, there it did not
appear that investors were rushing to take profits after the index
closed above 5,000 for the first time on Thursday. The Nasdaq
breached its latest thousand-point barrier just more than two
months after closing above 4,000 for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   With money from mutual funds and pension plans pouring into the
technology sector, most analysts expect the Nasdaq to remain the
best-performing U.S. stock index in the months to come.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq's dominance has come at the expense of blue-chip
industrial stocks. Today, Coca-Cola fell 1| to 45 and Procter &AMP;
Gamble fell 2 13/16 to 54 11/16.
</P>
<P>
   Investors fear those stocks are most vulnerable to rising
interest rates, which can cut into corporate profits as it becomes
more expensive to borrow money to finance growth.
</P>
<P>
   Declining issues outnumbered decliners by a narrow margin on the
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 378.94 million
shares, ahead of Thursday's early pace.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies rose 7.42 to 613.47.

<HEADLINE> Stocks Retreat From Early Gains  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks fell back from early gains today as
investors cashed in on the market's recent rise, especially the
sharp increases seen in technology shares.
</P>
<P>
   In midday trading Wall Street, the Nasdaq composite index was up
5.50 at 5,052.36 after being up 85 points in earlier trading.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were lower. The Dow Jones industrial
average was down 33.20 at 9,977.53. The blue-chip index had been up
80 points in early trading.
</P>
<P>
   The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was down 3.00 at 1,398.69.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq closed above 5,000 for the first time on Thursday,
breaching its latest thousand-point barrier just more than two
months after closing above 4,000 for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said some investors were taking profits on the Nasdaq's
dramatic gains.
</P>
<P>
   CMGI was down 6 13/16 at 138 9/16 and Qualcomm was off 4| at
122].
</P>
<P>
   ''The market started with a bullish tone today. However, traders
were quick to take profits,'' said Alan Ackerman, senior vice
president at Fahnestock &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
   Despite its weakness today, Ackerman and other analysts still
expect the Nasdaq to remain the best-performing U.S. stock index in
the months to come, thanks to big money from mutual funds and
pension plans pouring into the technology sector.
</P>
<P>
   Blue-chip shares came under selling pressure after Dial Corp.
announced its earnings for the first half of this year will be down
at least 10 percent from a year ago. Its stock plunged on the news,
falling 3{ to 10} in midday trading.
</P>
<P>
   Dial was the second consumer products company to forecast
disappointing earnings this week.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Procter &AMP; Gamble shook Wall Street when it announced
its third-quarter earnings would miss expectations. That sent the
Dow tumbling nearly 375 points.
</P>
<P>
   ''Another consumer products company stubbed its toe and now
buyers are wary of anything in the blue-chip sector,'' Ackerman
said.
</P>
<P>
   Declining issues outnumbered decliners by a 3-to-2 margin on the
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 555.39 million
shares, up from 492.14 million shares on Thursday.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Soap Star Plans Birth on TV  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID BAUDER, AP Television Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   DARIEN, Conn. (AP) -- Maura West and Scott DeFreitas could hardly
be described as private people. They're both actors on ''As the
World Turns'' and, in real life, DeFreitas proposed marriage on the
scoreboard at Yankee Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing compares to the ultimate act of exposure they'll
experience in a few weeks, when they invite a camera crew to film
the birth of their first baby for a TV audience.
</P>
<P>
   The baby's debut will be featured on an episode of ''A Baby
Story,'' a daily series on The Learning Channel that is quietly
catching on among young women, normally the target audience for the
made-up daytime dramas that employ West and DeFreitas.
</P>
<P>
   ''We enjoy the show so much that we just want to be a part of
it,'' said DeFreitas in an interview near the couple's suburban
Connecticut home.
</P>
<P>
   ''A Baby Story'' is part of TLC's effort to bring reality
television -- the kinder, gentler variety -- to daytime TV and give
viewers another option for a time period that's usually dominated
by soap operas, talk shows and courtroom shows.
</P>
<P>
   TLC began five years ago with ''A Wedding Story.'' Each episode
follows a couple as it plans and carries out their wedding, from
the seating plans to the bouquet toss.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago it added ''A Baby Story,'' which does the same
thing for the birth process, following a couple from early
pregnancy into the delivery room.
</P>
<P>
   TLC has done so well it is expanding its daytime reality
programming to 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. this fall. The cable network also
airs ''A Dating Story'' and in the fall will premiere a show about
makeovers.
</P>
<P>
   But ''A Baby Story,'' which airs back-to-back, 30-minute
episodes at 2 p.m. EST on weekdays, is the most successful of the
bunch. An estimated 700,000 people watch each episode,
three-quarters of them women. Fifty-four percent of the viewers are
women ages 18-34, a demographic group prized by advertisers.
</P>
<P>
   West, 27, has been a regular viewer since she became pregnant.
She has one child by a previous marriage.
</P>
<P>
   The couple has already filmed a segment for the show, describing
how they became friends in the close quarters of filming a daytime
drama. DeFreitas, 30, even pinpoints the day they fell in love --
Oct. 16, 1998 -- when they danced together at an industry function.
</P>
<P>
   Despite appearances, West insists she's not outgoing and wonders
how discreetly producers will show the birth.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't even know if I'll watch it,'' she said, shooting a
look at her husband. ''Do you think I'll watch it? I'll probably
watch it.''
</P>
<P>
   She figures the filming might be beneficial during the birth --
doctors, like everybody, tend to be on their toes when a camera is
running -- and might even help her. She wants to go as long as she
can without pain medication.
</P>
<P>
   ''If there's a camera there, it might stop me from saying, 'I'm
giving up, give me an epidural,''' she said. ''It might make me
tougher. I might not wimp out if I know everyone is watching.''
</P>
<P>
   Their episode will be telecast sometime in the fall, assuming
everything goes smoothly. If it doesn't go smoothly, it won't air
at all.
</P>
<P>
   The one requirement for all episodes of ''A Baby Story'' is that
they have a happy ending, said Chuck Gingold, TLC's senior vice
president. TLC's daytime schedule is meant to be enlightening and
uplifting, not a downer.
</P>
<P>
   Gwen Westley, a magazine editor from Manhattan, found ''A Baby
Story'' while channel surfing one day when she was pregnant with
her first child. She began watching it regularly.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's sort of comforting to see people have babies over and
over,'' she said. ''It makes you think, if they can do it, why
can't you.''
</P>
<P>
   She was particularly interested in an episode where a couple
delivered by Caesarean section, which she was scheduled for. Since
Westley's son, Devlin, was born, she's given up watching ''A Baby
Story.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I would find it too emotional,'' she said. ''Every time I
would be watching it, I would be crying. I guess I get enough
emotion now that I've had the baby. It's just not the same.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though births are one of the most intensely personal
episodes of a person's life, Gingold said producers have no
shortage of volunteer couples. DeFreitas said he wanted his baby's
birth documented, and didn't feel like holding a video camera.
</P>
<P>
   ''Being on the show is not even one-tenth of the importance of
what's happening,'' DeFreitas said. ''It's not like I had a burning
desire to have this birth be on 'A Baby Story.' It's more the birth
that really matters.''
</P>
<P>
   It's somewhat strange that a couple who works in one of the
oldest television forms -- the daytime drama -- is lending tacit
support to one of the newest at a time soaps are fading in
popularity. ''As the World Turns'' airs at the same time as ''A
Baby Story'' in New York and other markets.
</P>
<P>
   Viewers can thus choose between their characters, Carly Tenney
and Andy Dixon, or West and DeFreitas in a real-life drama.
</P>
<P>
   West and DeFreitas shrug this off. What's most important, West
said, is the chance to teach people who may be apprehensive about
the birth experience.
</P>
<P>
   ''A lot of women who know that there is such a show will watch
it when they're pregnant,'' she said. ''I think it will be very
helpful to people.''

<HEADLINE> Beaver College May Change Name  </HEADLINE>
By JONATHAN POET, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   GLENSIDE, Pa. (AP) -- Settle down, class. That will be enough
giggling. Let's all behave like mature young men and women while we
discuss why Beaver College is considering changing its name.
</P>
<P>
   ''The word 'beaver' too often elicits ridicule in the form of
derogatory remarks pertaining to the rodent, the TV show 'Leave It
to Beaver' and the vulgar reference to the female anatomy,'' Beaver
President Bette E. Landman wrote recently in a letter to 20,000
alumni, students, staff and benefactors.
</P>
<P>
   And at a time when more and more high school students are
researching colleges on the Web, some Internet filters that screen
out sexually explicit material are blocking access to the Beaver
College Web site. The filters have even blocked delivery of e-mail
originating from the school, Landman wrote.
</P>
<P>
   ''It has become a very big problem,'' said Beaver spokesman Bill
Avington. ''These filtering services, many of them have 'beaver' as
a word that is inappropriate. Especially when you consider the age
group we are targeting, it becomes tougher to get our message out.
Some students use this as their sole tool to choose colleges.''
</P>
<P>
   The college's own market research shows that the school appeals
to 30 percent fewer prospective students solely because of the
name.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are alumni reports that our name presents an obstacle
when seeking employment and that some have chosen not to display
their diplomas to avoid unkind remarks from colleagues,'' said the
president of the 2,800-student school in suburban Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   Beaver College has appeared on David Letterman's Top 10 list.
Conan O'Brien and Howard Stern have made jokes about it. And when
''Saturday Night Live'' writers invented an annoying film critic
for a recent sketch, they made him a representative of Beaver
College campus radio.
</P>
<P>
   ''My own daughter made a crack when I told her where I was going
to work,'' said Judy Wiley, a professor of psychology. ''She said,
'Mom, do you know what people use that word for?'''
</P>
<P>
   Heather Linsley, a senior, said: ''When we've gone away to
different conferences, we would swap items with other students and
our sweatshirts and T-shirts would be the hot item.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Usually it's the guys who want them,'' she added.
</P>
<P>
   Founded in 1853 in Beaver County near the Ohio line, the school
moved across the state to suburban Philadelphia in 1925.
</P>
<P>
   ''The name comes from the original location. There's no
particular reason to keep it,'' Wiley said. ''It is a name that
suffers from ridicule.''
</P>
<P>
   Avington said a decision on any name change is months away.
</P>
<P>
   Student Tom Bortner said he wouldn't change a thing.
</P>
<P>
   ''People made jokes when I told them where I was going to
school, but it's not a big deal,'' he said. ''You get over it
quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   Senior Rebecca Barlow said the name doesn't bother most
students.
</P>
<P>
   ''I understand how our society has given 'beaver' a bad
connotation, but it seems to me that the issue is external to the
college,'' she said. ''It's not a big deal to us.''

<HEADLINE> Drug May Remove Women's Facial Hair  </HEADLINE>
By JESSIE SEYFER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Women who spend way too much time plucking,
tweezing, waxing, zapping and shaving their facial hair may be in
for some relief.
</P>
<P>
   Studies show an experimental prescription medication cream
significantly slows facial hair growth on 70 percent of users.
</P>
<P>
   The drug is called Vaniqa, pronounced VAN-ih-kah, and it's
produced jointly by Gillette Co., the world's biggest manufacturer
of razors, and pharmaceutical maker Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.
</P>
<P>
   Vaniqa is under review by the Food and Drug Administration, and
is expected to win approval this summer and hit the market by the
fall.
</P>
<P>
   ''Until now there have been no topical creams which help slow
the rate of excessive hair growth,'' said Dr. Marty Sawaya, who
conducted the studies and presented her findings Friday at the
annual meeting of the American Academy of Dermatology.
</P>
<P>
   ''Women have been able to temporarily control this condition by
shaving, tweezing or waxing. Based on the results of these studies,
(Vaniqa) is the first topical cream that inhibits the growth rate
of facial hair, thereby reducing the time women have to spend
managing it,'' Sawaya said.
</P>
<P>
   In Sawaya's 24-week study on 596 women with excessive facial
hair, 70 percent of them showed marked improvement, meaning the
patches where Vaniqa was applied became clear or almost clear of
new hair growth. A significant difference in hair growth showed up
as early as four weeks after the treatment started.
</P>
<P>
   Side effects found in the study included stinging, burning,
tingling and acne.
</P>
<P>
   Darrell Rigel, president of the American Academy of Dermatology,
said that the drug will help with a problem that, because of
cultural taboos about women's facial hair, deeply troubles many of
his patients.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's an appearance issue and people who have it are very
concerned about it,'' said Rigel, a professor at New York
University.
</P>
<P>
   ''Most of the treatments that are out there are basically merely
temporary in nature. This is something that really gets (results)
by attacking the hair follicle itself. It cuts down on the
long-term growth of hair,'' he said. Rigel cautioned that, while
easier to use, Vaniqa is not necessarily more effective than laser
removal or electrolysis.
</P>
<P>
   Vaniqa is applied to the face like a moisturizer twice a day. It
works by blocking a key enzyme that makes hair grow and must be
used regularly or else hair growth will resume. No price has been
set for the cream.
</P>
<P>
   Patients in Sawaya's study were considered to have excessive
hair growth because they had to remove 20 hairs a week on average,
besides eyebrow hairs. This kind of growth affects an estimated one
in six American women, and may be caused by heredity, normal aging
or medical conditions such as hormone imbalances.

<HEADLINE> Feds Consider Two-Year Budgets  </HEADLINE>
By JIM ABRAMS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The White House budget director on Friday
endorsed the idea of two-year budgets, saying it would give both
the administration and Congress more time to consider the policies
behind the money they are spending.
</P>
<P>
   But Office of Management and Budget Director Jack Lew also
cautioned that changing the process won't help unless Congress and
the White House become less adversarial.
</P>
<P>
   ''A lot of the problems are not written in the rule book,'' Lew
told the House Rules Committee. ''There's a need for comity between
the branches.''
</P>
<P>
   Proposals to change the current annual budget process to a
biennial system are not new, but they have picked up support in
recent years because of the yearly budget disputes between the
Democratic White House and the Republican Congress that have led to
delays, government shutdowns and general ill will.
</P>
<P>
   ''I happen to believe the case for biennial budgeting is
overwhelming,'' said Rules Committee Chairman David Dreier,
R-Calif., who last year got 245 House members, a majority, to sign
a resolution in support of enacting a biennial budget bill this
year.
</P>
<P>
   Proponents argue that biennial budgeting, practiced by some 20
state governments, would have lawmakers devote the first year of a
two-year session of Congress to drawing up and passing budgets,
allowing them to spend the second year examining spending programs
to ensure they are operating properly.
</P>
<P>
   ''The current process does not serve us well,'' said Lew, noting
that President Clinton and Vice President Al Gore have advocated
biennial budgets. He said the current one-year process is
inefficient and consumes time better spent in ''longer-term and
more in-depth perspective.''
</P>
<P>
   But Rep. Joe Moakley, D-Mass., ranking Democrat on the panel,
said that while he liked the idea of spending less time on the
budget ''I'm skeptical it would really happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Louis Fisher of the Congressional Research Service agreed that
with a two-year time frame legislators might ''relax and push the
debate on the two-year budget into the early months of the second
year.''
</P>
<P>
   Dan Crippen, director of the Congressional Budget Office, said
agreeing on budgets won't get any easier as long as the White House
and Congress are controlled by different parties. ''That
disagreement, not the budget cycle, may be the biggest hurdle to
smoother budget deliberations in the Congress.''

<HEADLINE> Report: Company will announce competing line of small printers  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   STAMFORD, Conn. (AP) -- Xerox Corp., its profits pummeled by a
restructuring, Y2K worries and a realignment of its sales force,
will take aim at rival Hewlett-Packard with a new line of inkjet
printers.
</P>
<P>
   The company scheduled a news conference in New York City on
Tuesday. The Wall Street Journal reported Friday that the
announcement will center on a new line of inkjet printers intended
to compete with HP's desktop models.
</P>
<P>
   Xerox spokeswoman Christa Carone in Rochester, N.Y., confirmed
that the announcement would deal with small office and home-office
products. But she said she could not release any details or confirm
the newspaper report.
</P>
<P>
   Analyst Ben Reitzes of PaineWebber Inc. told the newspaper that
Xerox is trying to create a product line offering a higher-speed,
lower-cost alternative to HP's models, which range from about $100
to $800 and print up to 12 pages a minute.
</P>
<P>
   Palo Alto, Calif.-based HP dominates the home printer market,
which has grown as Internet and home computer use increased.
</P>
<P>
   HP spokesman Nolan Sundrud said the company knows Xerox has
filed several patents and has anticipated it would develop products
based on the technology. He said HP isn't ''frightened or
concerned'' by the Xerox announcement.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Xerox invested $300 million in inkjet development,
building production plants in Ireland and New York. Xerox also has
an agreement with Lexmark International Group Inc. to make inkjet
printers for Xerox.
</P>
<P>
   Xerox announced in January that its fourth-quarter earnings were
down 52 percent as it struggled with increased competition and
sales that were diminished by anxiety about possible computer
problems related to the change to 2000. The company said it was
pursuing cost-cutting steps but did not say what they might be.
</P>
<P>
   Earnings were down 11 percent in the third quarter, and the
company warned that similar declines were likely in first and
second quarters this year.
</P>
<P>
   The company has also blamed part of a sales slump on a
reorganization of its sales and billing systems. In 1999, Xerox
announced a plan to streamline its U.S. customer administration by
consolidating 36 billing centers across the country into three
centralized centers.
</P>
<P>
   The company also said it would reorganize its 14,000-person
sales force to boost sales of ''bundled'' services to corporate
customers -- integrating fax machines, printers, copiers and
personal computer software. Xerox said it planned to move its sales
force away from geographical coverage toward coverage of specific
industries.
</P>
<P>
   Both moves have caused disruption and slowed productivity, the
company has acknowledged.

<HEADLINE> Cunard To Build Ship in France  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- Cunard Line officials have signed a letter of
intent to build the superliner Queen Mary 2 at the Alstom Chantiers
de L'Atlantique shipyard in Saint-Nazaire, France.
</P>
<P>
   The Miami-based cruise line operator said Thursday that the
1,130-foot liner that wioll carry 2,800 passengers is expected to
be launched in the last quarter of 2003.
</P>
<P>
   The Franco-British transport and energy engineering group Alstom
SA said Friday that it expects the contract for building the
superliner will be worth about $700 million.
</P>
<P>
   Alstom hopes to sign the final agreement, subject to several
conditions including financing, in the coming weeks, a spokesman at
the company said.
</P>
<P>
   The Queen Mary 2 will fly the British flag and make its homeport
at Southampton, England.
</P>
<P>
   ''The signing of this letter of intent is a significant
milestone in the birth of this unique vessel,'' Micky Arison,
chairman and chief executive of Carnival Corp., Cunard's parent
company, said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ''Over the last months, our vision of the first true ocean liner
to be built in a generation has evolved from a dream to a detailed
plan on paper,'' Arison said. ''We are satisfied that the shipyard
that created Normandie, France and other legendary liners has the
capability to make that dream a reality.''
</P>
<P>
   The Alstom Chantiers de L'Atlantique shipyard employs over 4,000
workers.

<HEADLINE> Stocks Mostly Higher  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were mostly higher today as financial
shares rose, buoying the market even as investors cashed in some
gains from the recent rise in high-tech issues.
</P>
<P>
   In afternoon trading on Wall Street, the Nasdaq composite index
was up 50.61 at 5,097.47. Earlier in the session, the index had
dipped to a loss of 7 points before heading higher again.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were also shifting between gains and
losses. The Dow Jones industrial average was up 25.44 at 10,036.17
and the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was up 3.52 at 1,405.21.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said market indexes were regrouping as investors
digested the Nasdaq's recent sprint. The index closed above 5,000
for the first time on Thursday, breaching its latest thousand-point
barrier just more than two months after closing above 4,000 for the
first time.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said some investors were taking profits on the Nasdaq's
dramatic gains.
</P>
<P>
   CMGI was down 6 13/16 at 138 9/16 and Qualcomm was off 4| at
122].
</P>
<P>
   ''The market started with a bullish tone today. However, traders
were quick to take profits,'' said Alan Ackerman, senior vice
president at Fahnestock &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
   Despite its weakness today, Ackerman and other analysts still
expect the Nasdaq to remain the best-performing U.S. stock index in
the months to come, thanks to big money from mutual funds and
pension plans pouring into the technology sector.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, some technology stocks continued to attract buyers. Dell
Computer rose 3] to 53 13/16 after PaineWebber raised its rating on
the stock to ''buy.''
</P>
<P>
   Financial shares were among the strongest performers today.
American Express rose 6[ to 128~, the biggest gainer among Dow
components. First Union rose 1 5/16 to 31 5/16 after announcing a
series of executive changes.
</P>
<P>
   Merrill Lynch rose 4~ to 108 and Charles Schwab rose 4 3/16 to
51[.
</P>
<P>
   Consumer goods stocks, however, continued to struggle. Dial
Corp. announced its earnings for the first half of this year will
be down at least 10 percent from a year ago. Its stock plunged on
the news, falling 3 7/16 to 10 13/16.
</P>
<P>
   Dial was the second consumer products company to forecast
disappointing earnings this week. On Tuesday, Procter &AMP; Gamble
shook Wall Street when it announced its third-quarter earnings
would miss expectations. That sent the Dow tumbling nearly 375
points.
</P>
<P>
   ''Another consumer products company stubbed its toe and now
buyers are wary of anything in the blue-chip sector,'' Ackerman
said.
</P>
<P>
   Declining issues outnumbered decliners by a 4-to-3 margin on the
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 794.68 million
shares, up from 750.16 million shares on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies rose 3.98 to 610.03.

<HEADLINE> Infineon's IPO Expected To Soar  </HEADLINE>
By HANS GREIMEL, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) -- Shares in Infineon Technologies AG,
the semiconductor branch of electronics giant Siemens AG, are
expected to explode in value when they hit the market Monday in
Germany's biggest public offering since Deutsche Telekom went on
the block in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The sale, coming as Siemens' former loss-making subsidiary is
staging an impressive comeback, could boost Siemens' coffers with
billions of dollars, bolstering it with funds for further
investment.
</P>
<P>
   The German electronics company plans to float 29 percent of
Infineon, issuing up to 173 million shares between $28 and $34
apiece. At the high end, the sale is expected to raise $5.8
billion.
</P>
<P>
   Priced well below lofty technology stocks already on the market,
investors considered the issue a bargain and oversubscribed.
Monday's opening price will be officially set on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ''I had no idea the interest would be so enormous, and probably
the company didn't either, otherwise it would have raised the
price,'' said Hannah Cunliffe, a fund manager with Union Investment
in Frankfurt.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts believe Infineon shares could triple during their
initial trading, but Cunliffe's expectations were a bit more
tempered.
</P>
<P>
   ''First day trading is always guess work,'' she said. ''It
should double by the end of the year, but if it doubles or triples
in the first day, we'll have to wait to see how long it stays at
the price,''
</P>
<P>
   Deutsche Telekom's raised $11.33 billion from its initial
offering of 600 million shares, though its stock rose just 2
percent on its opening day.
</P>
<P>
   Infineon is rebounding from a grim 1998, when it chalked up
losses to the tune of 1.2 billion marks ($588 million), due mainly
to plummeting demand and withering prices. The red figures
persuaded Siemens to spin off the loss-making unit.
</P>
<P>
   But the branch has since gone back in the black, helping Siemens
double its profits in 1999 from the year before. The recovery was
in part due to resurgent demand which lifted the entire chip
industry, including Infineon's competitors Hyundai Electronics,
U.S.-based Atmel and France-based STMicroelectronics, Europe's
second biggest chip maker after Philips.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was in dire straits in '98, but Siemens has really invested
a lot in it just because of that reason,'' said Cunliffe. ''If you
talk to people who buy chips, the name Infineon comes up much more
often now that it did just a year ago. It's going to be a big
company.''
</P>
<P>
   She said the company could take a leading role in the nascent
market for electronic money and identification cards, known as
smart cards, but warned that it still lags behind in mobile
communications chips, which is a rapidly expanding sector.
</P>
<P>
   In October, Siemens went public with its first spinoff,
electronic component maker Escos AG. That sale raised about $945
million.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Billy Joel went to Congress to crusade for
Long Island's lobstermen.
</P>
<P>
   The singer pressed lawmakers Thursday for more federal aid to
battle a mysterious ailment killing off lobsters and threatening
the industry on Long Island Sound.
</P>
<P>
   Joel, a native of Long Island, said at a news conference that
the disappearance of lobstermen would change the area's fabric.
</P>
<P>
   ''People should come to Long Island not just because it sells
postcards and T-shirts but because it sells lobsters,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Joel recently sold his home in the Hamptons, on eastern Long
Island, to Jerry Seinfeld for $40 million and is moving to Long
Island's North Shore overlooking the Sound.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton has called for $10 million in aid for Long
Island lobstermen, but lawmakers from Connecticut and New York are
pushing for $30 million.

<HEADLINE> Bolivia Fires Cabinet Minister  </HEADLINE>
By PETER McFARREN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LA PAZ, Bolivia (AP) -- Bolivia yielded to what it termed U.S.
pressure Friday and forced the resignation of a Cabinet minister
reputed to have helped get an Italian man acquitted of drug
trafficking charges.
</P>
<P>
   The Bolivian government stressed that it had no evidence of
wrongdoing by Information Minister Jorge Landivar, but agreed to
ask him to resign in order to preserve good relations with the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   The friction was unusual, considering Bolivia has been a strong
ally of U.S. efforts to fight drug trafficking and has been highly
successful in reducing the country's cocaine production, currently
the third-largest in Latin America.
</P>
<P>
   Landivar's forced resignation came two weeks after the U.S.
Embassy here expressed ''strong disappointment'' over the acquittal
two weeks ago of Italian Marco Marino Diodato, the husband of
President Hugo Banzer's niece and an honorary officer in the
Bolivian army.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have no evidence that Minister Landivar influenced the
not-guilty ruling, but the embassy of the United States pressured
for him to be removed from the government,'' Interior Minister
Walter Guiteras said.
</P>
<P>
   The Bolivian government admitted irregularities occurred in the
trial, criticized the acquittal and appealed the verdict. For his
part, Banzer distanced himself from Diodato, saying there was solid
evidence against him and calling for a full investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Neither government explained how Landivar supposedly interfered
with the trial; but Landivar had publicly said during the trial he
thought Diodato was innocent.
</P>
<P>
   Guiteras said he extensively discussed Landivar's alleged
support for Diodato with American officials. The U.S. Embassy never
made a public request for his resignation and it refused to comment
on whether it had pressured Bolivia.
</P>
<P>
   Diodato and six others were found innocent of cocaine production
and trafficking by a drug court in the tropical city of Santa Cruz,
560 miles east of La Paz.
</P>
<P>
   Diodato, 35, was arrested last year after he was caught cloning
cellular cell telephones.
</P>
<P>
   Police also accused him of wiretapping communications among
anti-drug agents, operating cocaine labs and filming government
officials and politicians in sexual encounters with prostitutes,
allegedly in order to blackmail them. Officials said Diodato has
links with Italian Mafia.
</P>
<P>
   Diodato's attorney claimed cocaine labs already existed on a
Bolivian farm when the Italian bought it; the court agreed, saying
there was insufficient evidence against Diodato and the other
defendants, who included Italians, Bolivians and Argentines.
</P>
<P>
   Diodato is held at the Palmasola prison in Santa Cruz, pending
additional charges for intercepting phone calls and operating
illegal gambling casinos.

<HEADLINE> Grocery store chain to offer products online  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ROCHESTER, N.Y. (AP) -- An upscale supermarket chain will soon
allow shoppers to bid online for groceries, saving them money at
the cost of a little extra inconvenience.
</P>
<P>
   Wegmans Food Markets Inc., which operates 52 stores in New York,
six in Pennsylvania and one in New Jersey, is teaming up with
Internet sales giant Priceline.com to open up to bidding about 800
name-brand products.
</P>
<P>
   Once a bid is accepted, a shopper must pick the item up at the
store.
</P>
<P>
   The program will debut April 9 in Buffalo and Jamestown, plus
Erie and Allentown, Pa., and Princeton, N.J. It will expand April
23 to Syracuse and Rochester, the family-operated grocery chain's
hometown since 1915.
</P>
<P>
   Wegmans said customers typically will save $13 on a $35 order.
However, shoppers will have to shop twice -- first on the Web site,
then by picking the products off the shelves at the store.
</P>
<P>
   On the Web site, shoppers will find products divided into
categories such as breakfast cereal, produce, dairy and bread.
Below each item will be listed the average retail price for the
item to provide consumers an idea of how much to offer.
</P>
<P>
   The operator will suggest four lower prices that consumers might
choose to offer and rate them as having a ''great chance'' to a
''low chance'' of having them accepted. Consumers also have the
option of selecting their own price.
</P>
<P>
   At the store checkout, shoppers will swipe a Priceline card for
the pre-ordered items. If they purchase other items, those will be
rung up separately.
</P>
<P>
   ''The program is really built for someone who has extra time and
is very value conscious,'' Debra Perosio, a professor in the Food
Industry Management Program at Cornell University, said in Friday's
Rochester Democrat and Chronicle.
</P>
<P>
   Priceline launched its grocery program in New York City in
November and has since expanded into Philadelphia,
Baltimore-Washington, southeastern Virginia and Detroit. While it
has registered more than 250,000 shoppers, the program is not
likely to be the next big supermarket trend, analysts say.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's far from being a proven model,'' Neil Stern, a food
industry consultant with MacMillian/Doolittle, told The Buffalo
News. ''Its essential premise -- that people will place saving money
over convenience -- has never been proven true in supermarketing.
Convenience has always been the driving force.''

<HEADLINE> 18 Die in Sri Lanka Bomb Explosion  </HEADLINE>
By DILSHIKA JAYAMAHA, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) -- A bomber blew himself up, killing 18
other people and wounding 46 on a busy street in Sri Lanka's
capital Friday, but apparently missed his target -- a motorcade of
Cabinet ministers.
</P>
<P>
   Police said the attack was planned: in addition to the bomb that
went off, jackets laden with explosives and two rocket-propelled
grenades were found in the area. Military officials blamed Tamil
separatists for the blast.
</P>
<P>
   The wounded and the dead, mostly people who had been headed home
from work, were taken to the National Hospital in Colombo, many
with abdominal injuries. Two dozen cars were damaged.
</P>
<P>
   ''There were lots of vehicles at that time, and then there was a
big explosion and then I heard gunfire after the blast,'' said D.A.
Ratnayake, a traffic policeman who was wounded in the explosion.
</P>
<P>
   Ratnayake was part of a large security detail, including
anti-terrorist commandos, assigned to guard the Cabinet ministers
as they traveled home from Parliament. Five of the 19 people killed
in the blast were police officers.
</P>
<P>
   Gunfire could be heard from the cordoned-off Borella area, the
commercial hub of Colombo, up to an hour after the explosion. At
least 200 soldiers took up positions on the streets and helicopters
circled the area, looking for possible accomplices in the bombing.
</P>
<P>
   ''I saw five armed men running,'' said K. Vasantha, a
27-year-old resident of the area. ''They were all armed. They
threatened everyone and kept on running,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The men ran in the direction of the road leading to Parliament,
apparently discarding explosive-laden jackets as they escaped.
</P>
<P>
   The blast came as Parliament discussed extending emergency rule
in northern Sri Lanka, a measure that gives broad powers to the
army and police fighting Tamil rebels there.
</P>
<P>
   ''The defense minister was in parliament. This was a known
fact,'' said Science and Technology Minister Batty Weerakoon. ''I
am not surprised if he was the target.''
</P>
<P>
   The defense minister, Anuruddha Ratwatte, heads military
operations against the rebel movement, known as the Tamil Tigers.
He narrowly escaped two previous assassination attempts.
</P>
<P>
   Based on remains found at the scene, police believe the suicide
bomber was either in a car or leaving it, with the intention of
stationing himself in the front of the ministers' motorcade.
</P>
<P>
   The bomb apparently went off prematurely, said authorities,
speaking on condition of anonymity. It was unclear if the bomber
was carrying the device or if it was in his car.
</P>
<P>
   There was no claim of responsibility for the bombing.
</P>
<P>
   The Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam are the principal suspects
in most explosions in Sri Lanka.
</P>
<P>
   The guerrilla group has been fighting for 17 years for a
separate homeland for the country's 3.3 million Tamils, a minority
of Sri Lanka's 18.6-million, mainly Sinhalese population. The
conflict has claimed 61,000 lives.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, analysts and rebels expressed confidence that an
Oslo-backed peace initiative to end the war will continue despite
the fall of Norway's coalition government Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Norway has been trying to facilitate peace talks. The Sri Lankan
government held unsuccessful negotiations with the rebels in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   The government is pushing a new constitution that would provide
wide autonomy to the eight provinces in the island nation off the
coast of India.

<HEADLINE> Putin Recalls KGB Career With Pride  </HEADLINE>
By VLADIMIR ISACHENKOV, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- Acting President Vladimir Putin says his many
years in the KGB taught him the spy agency's aims were wrong, but
at least it was well run.
</P>
<P>
   His only failing as an agent was lack of fear, he added in
comments published Friday that are sure that bolster the tough
image Putin is riding to a wide lead in pre-election polls.
</P>
<P>
   Putin told the newspaper Kommersant that he recognized the KGB
served unpalatable totalitarian aims. But, he said, ''I never was
dissident-oriented -- whether that is good or bad.''
</P>
<P>
   He also praised the KGB as a professional and smooth-running
operation and criticized its post-Soviet successors as sloppy.
Putin's popularity in opinion polls before the March 26 vote
appears to stem in part from his image as a hard-nosed
administrator aiming for efficiency in the sprawling and
disorganized country.
</P>
<P>
   He has also called for increasing the state's strength, a stance
that Mikhail Gorbachev, the last leader of the Soviet Union, said
Friday made him wary.
</P>
<P>
   ''To say that he's not sinful, no, look at how many small and
serious mistakes he has made,'' Gorbachev told a news conference.
''Some of them reflect his authoritarianism, but people are not
afraid of this.''
</P>
<P>
   Opinion polls show Putin getting support of about 60 percent,
with his nearest challenger, Communist Gennady Zyuganov, recording
about 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Gorbachev assessed Putin as smart and serious. But Gorbachev
said Putin's chances in upcoming elections could be damaged if he
doesn't distance himself from the inner circle of former President
Boris Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
   Putin has spoken out against corruption and how it undermines
trust in leaders, but has not specifically addressed allegations of
widespread corruption in the Kremlin during Yeltsin's term.
</P>
<P>
   Putin told Kommersant that he could ''theoretically'' support
the return of Yuri Skuratov, the prosecutor-general suspended by
Yeltsin as Skuratov was probing corruption allegations last year.
</P>
<P>
   The full-page interview gave Russians an unusually wide view of
the man who was largely unknown to them before becoming prime
minister last August and then acting president when Yeltsin
unexpectedly resigned Dec. 31. Although he has received much media
exposure since then, Putin appears intensely controlled and gives
little personal information.
</P>
<P>
   He offered few details about his years with the KGB in East
Germany, but recalled a tense moment after the fall of the Berlin
Wall, when he single-handedly turned back an angry crowd advancing
on the KGB office in Dresden.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was a serious threat, we had documents there,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He said the only negative characteristic his bosses noted was
that he had a ''decreased sense of danger.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't and I didn't think that I had a decreased sense of
danger, but psychologists came to this conclusion having followed
my behavior for a long time,'' Putin said.
</P>
<P>
   Putin said he decided to join the KGB at age 16 but an official
at the headquarters told him they only recruit university
graduates. The KGB offered a job to Putin shortly before his
graduation, and he eagerly agreed.
</P>
<P>
   Putin, a native of Leningrad, was involved in office work and
then counterespionage operations in the city for about 10 years
before he was posted to Germany.
</P>
<P>
   He left the KGB in 1991 after the attempted hard-line coup
against Gorbachev. At that time he had already quit as a full-time
agent and was working as an aide to Anatoly Sobchak, then the
reformist mayor of St. Petersburg. He became head of the KGB's main
successor, the FSB, in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Putin also reinforced his tough stance on the Chechnya war.
Asked by the newspaper whether it was necessary to have launched
the Chechen campaign, he responded sharply: ''We didn't begin
anything. We are defending ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   He angrily dismissed allegations that the FSB itself had set up
apartment bombings last fall blamed on Chechen rebels, which helped
trigger the Russian offensive.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's delirious nonsense,'' he said. ''There are no people in
the Russian secret services who would be capable of such crime
against their own people. The very allegation is immoral.''

   Wall Street Stocks Mostly Higher
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were mostly higher this afternoon as
financial shares rose, buoying the market even as investors cashed
in some gains from the recent rise in high-tech issues. While CMGI
was down 6 13/16 at 138 9/16 and Qualcomm was off 4| at 122],
analysts still expect the Nasdaq to remain the best-performing
index in the months to come. Indeed, Dell Computer rose 3] to 53
13/16 after PaineWebber raised its rating on the stock to ''buy.''
Among financial shares, American Express rose 6[ to 128~, the
biggest gainer among Dow components. Merrill Lynch rose 4~ to 108
and Charles Schwab rose 4 3/16 to 51[. Consumer goods stocks,
however, continued to struggle.

   FCC Approves Qwest, U S West Merger
</P>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal regulators today conditionally
approved the $50 billion merger of Qwest Communications Inc. and
regional Bell company U S West Inc. Qwest will have to divest
itself of its customers in the U S West territory of 14 Western
states. The Federal Communications Commission gave conditional
approval on a 5-0 vote. The FCC said Qwest must give up about 6
percent of its long-distance customers, all of whom live in areas
served by U S West. Qwest's shares were down 13.75 percent, or
$8.25 to $51.75 in afternoon trading on the NYSE. U.S. West was
down 8.33 percent, or $6.37, at $70.12.

   Dial Expects Earnings To Sink
</P>
<P>
   SCOTTSDALE, Ariz. (AP) -- Soap maker Dial Corp. said Friday its
earnings per share will be down by at least 10 percent in the first
half compared with a year ago. Dial shares plunged on the news,
falling 3 7/16 to 10 13/16 in afternoon trading on the New York
Stock Exchange. Dial's announcement followed a similar earnings
warning from consumer products industry leader Procter &AMP; Gamble Co.
that caused that that company's stock to plunge by about 31 percent

   Feds Consider Two-Year Budgets

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The White House budget director today endorsed
the idea of two-year budgets, saying it would give both the
administration and Congress more time to consider the policies
behind the money they are spending. But Office of Management and
Budget Director Jack Lew also cautioned that changing the process
won't help unless Congress and the White House become less
adversarial. ''A lot of the problems are not written in the rule
book,'' Lew told the House Rules Committee. ''There's a need for
comity between the branches.''

   US Air Attendants Show Strike Plans
</P>
<P>
   PITTSBURGH (AP) -- The union representing US Airways flight
attendants today released a list of 49 flight routes that they may
randomly strike if the company does not agree to pay raises and
other contract improvements. The Association of Flight Attendants
said it was releasing the list prior to the planned March 25 strike
action so that customers would have time to book other flights. But
the airline said it would shut down all its routes if no accord is
reached by then. The routes include several flights in and out of
New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, Houston, Philadelphia, Phoenix,
Atlanta and Baltimore.

   Tokyo Gov. Defends Bank Tax Plan

   TOKYO (AP) -- Tokyo governor Shintaro Ishihara today defended his
plan to tax banks to raise cash for the capital's depleted coffers,
which critics say could stifle economic recovery. ''Tokyo doesn't
have much money, so I had to look for a unique source of income,''
Ishihara said. He wants about 30 top banks to pay a combined total
of about $1.03 billion more in taxes annually starting April 1,
when the new fiscal year begins. The financial industry says
Ishihara is unfairly singling out banks and threatening the
industry's comeback from years of deep financial troubles.

   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) -- Shares in Infineon Technologies AG,
the semiconductor branch of electronics giant Siemens AG, are
expected to explode in value when they hit the market Monday in
Germany's biggest public offering since Deutsche Telekom went on
the block in 1996. The sale could boost Siemens' coffers with
billions of dollars, bolstering it with funds for further
investment. The German electronics company plans to float 29
percent of Infineon, issuing up to 173 million shares between $28
and $34 apiece. At the high end, the sale is expected to raise $5.8

<HEADLINE> 10 reputed Lucchese associates plead guilty  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEWARK, N.J. (AP) -- Ten men who prosecutors said tried to
rebuild a Lucchese crime family wounded by past arrests and
convictions in New Jersey have pleaded guilty to racketeering and
other charges.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors and attorneys reached plea agreements Thursday with
the reputed mob associates, who were to face trial later this
month. The trial was expected to be one of the most expensive in
Essex County history.
</P>
<P>
   The men were arrested in 1995, but the trial was delayed by a
change of judges and the time it took to transcribe hundreds of
taped conversations recorded by an undercover agent.
</P>
<P>
   Louis ''Dukey'' DeMary, 60, of Fairfield, would face the longest
prison term of 14 years for racketeering, loan sharking and theft
of services. His lawyer, Thomas Cataldo, said Friday DeMary was
concerned about a possible life sentence in prison if convicted and
agreed to plead guilty in a deal that would spare his two sons,
also indicted, prison time.
</P>
<P>
   Cataldo said he believed the defense would have exposed the
informant's lack of credibility at trial.
</P>
<P>
   ''Although I thought we had a lot of things to work with, you
just don't know,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Dubbed ''Operation Used-To-Be,'' the investigation into the
defendants' racketeering, loan sharking and illegal gambling
activities began in 1994 and ended in the arrests of 11 reputed
members of the New Jersey crew of the Lucchese family in July 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities said the defendants controlled a gambling enterprise
out of a Bloomfield health club, overseeing illegal card and dice
games, slot machines and illegal numbers operations in northern New
Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators said the defendants also conducted an illegal loan
sharking operation, charging more than 50 percent per year on the
money they loaned.
</P>
<P>
   Also pleading guilty was Robert ''Bucky'' Caravaggio, 60, of
Livingston, who was taped discussing who the reputed boss of the
New York-based Genovese crime family would install as leader of the
Philadelphia-Atlantic City mob, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   ''These pleas represent a significant blow to a group that was
attempting to fill the void left by the incarceration of other
members of the Lucchese family,'' said William Gicking, one of the
deputy attorneys general assigned to the prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   The family's power in New Jersey began to unravel in 1993 after
Michael Taccetta, his brother Martin Taccetta, Thomas Ricciardi and
Anthony ''Tumac'' Accetturro were convicted in an attempt to take
over a video poker business in Lakewood. Accetturro, who
prosecutors said headed the family's New Jersey faction, and
Ricciardi began cooperating with authorities.
</P>
<P>
   Superior Court Judge William Goldman, who scheduled sentencings
for the men in April and May, was preparing to assemble a jury pool
of 9,000 people for the trial.
</P>
<P>
   Caravaggio was the last holdout in plea negotiations, which
began several months ago. Thomas Ashley, his attorney, said
Caravaggio would have opted for a trial had he been tried alone. He
faces up to five years in prison on a plea of conspiracy to commit
racketeering.
</P>
<P>
   Also entering pleas were John Tizio, 40, of Orange, on charges
of conspiracy to commit racketeering, loan-sharking and possessing
fireworks; Michael D'Aloia, 37, of Livingston, for promoting
gambling, distribution of marijuana and a disorderly persons
offense; and Joseph Prelli, 63, of New York, for promoting
gambling.
</P>
<P>
   Goldman said five men were likely to face probation for their
crimes, among them Louis DeMary Jr., 32, and Frank DeMary, 30, for
loan sharking.

<HEADLINE> Rain Hinders Mozambique Aid Effort  </HEADLINE>
By ANDREW SELSKY, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   MAPUTO, Mozambique (AP) -- The heavy rains that temporarily
halted relief efforts let up Friday, permitting helicopters and
airplanes to deliver aid to hundreds of thousands of victims of
Mozambique's devastating flooding.
</P>
<P>
   But with banks of rain-swollen clouds sweeping in from the
Indian Ocean, it was unclear how much time international relief
workers had to reach hungry flood victims before the waters come
again.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're very concerned,'' South African air force Maj. Matthew
Carter said. ''If the rain persists, the roads will be back to
square one.''
</P>
<P>
   Lindsey Davis, a World Food Program spokeswoman, said the 74
camps distributing rice, beans and other food to an estimated
250,000 people would run out of rations in a day or two unless they
were resupplied.
</P>
<P>
   Aid agency officials expect the death toll from the flood to
soar into the thousands. Up to a million Mozambicans lost their
homes, crops or other property in three weeks of rain that caused
the Limpopo and Save rivers to overflow, spreading beyond their
banks up to 30 miles at some points. Thousands of people spent days
in treetops or on roofs as the flooding left towns almost entirely
submerged.
</P>
<P>
   The waters receded earlier this week, but then nearly two more
days of rain in southern Mozambique paralyzed aid efforts and
turned roads, critical for transporting aid, into quagmires.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday morning, more than 3,000 flood victims crammed into an
abandoned cashew warehouse on the outskirts in Maputo, the capital,
to escape the downpour.
</P>
<P>
   Manuel Mula, 29, has lived in the sweltering, cavernous building
since his neighborhood was flooded a month ago. Mula's possessions
and those of a dozen other people -- cooking pots, utensils and a
few coloring books -- rest on rusted metal tables once used for
sorting cashews.
</P>
<P>
   Mula stepped outside Friday, stared up at the leaden skies and
shook his head.
</P>
<P>
   ''I can't wait for this rain to stop,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   When the latest rain diminished before noon, 10 British, Spanish
and South African helicopters loaded with relief supplies took to
the air immediately from airports in Maputo and nearby Palmeira.
They were bound for the Limpopo River valley.
</P>
<P>
   In their second day of delivering aid, U.S. military helicopters
flew health workers to three villages near the mouth of the Save
River, farther north. The workers found cases of malaria but no
major flood-related illnesses, the World Food Program's Abby Spring
said.
</P>
<P>
   Another U.S. helicopter delivered building materials and seed to
the village of Mambone, 80 miles south of the Indian Ocean port
city of Beira. Seed is vital: The flooding has crippled one-third
of Mozambique's production of cereal grains, according to the
United Nations, and planting season is only a month away.
</P>
<P>
   Helicopters also delivered cooking oil, corn, flour and corn
meal to 35,000 people along the Save River.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon has four helicopters, nine C-130 airplanes and at
least 500 soldiers participating in the mission, dubbed ''Operation
Atlas Response.''
</P>
<P>
   Rain was having disastrous consequences outside Mozambique as
well.
</P>
<P>
   In nearby Madagascar, severe flooding triggered by Cyclone Eline
and tropical storm Gloria has killed at least 130 people and chased
another 10,000 from their homes, the government said. Between
560,000 and 740,000 people have lost crops or other property on the
Indian Ocean island, officials there said.
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. food agency appealed Friday for helicopters to
distribute urgently needed aid to areas of Madagascar cut off by
the floods and threatened with cholera.

<HEADLINE> Innocent Plea in War Crimes Case  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) -- A 62-year-old Serb, the oldest
defendant to appear before the Yugoslav war crimes tribunal,
pleaded innocent Friday to charges he oversaw rape, torture and
murder at the notorious Omarska prison camp.
</P>
<P>
   Dragoljub Prcac, allegedly deputy commander at Omarska, was
formally charged with eight counts of war crimes, crimes against
humanity and grave breaches of the Geneva Conventions. A trial date
was expected to be set later this month.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors say Muslim and Croat prisoners were beaten,
tortured, raped and murdered on a daily basis at the camp. Prcac, a
former police officer, faces a life jail term if found guilty of
any one of the charges outlined in the indictment.
</P>
<P>
   The trial of four other alleged leading figures at Omarska began
March 2.
</P>
<P>
   Prcac and the two other suspects in the Omarska indictment --
identified as the camp's commander and security chief, Zeljko
Meakic, and shift commander Momcilo Gruban -- are expected to be
tried separately from the other defendants. Meakic and Gruban are
still at large.
</P>
<P>
   Prcac joins another 35 Serb, Croat and Muslim war crimes
suspects in custody at the U.N. tribunal. The court was set up by
the Security Council in 1993 in the wake of an international outcry
over conditions at Omarska and two other Serb-run detention camps.

<HEADLINE> Nasdaq Adds 33; Dow Slips 38  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were mixed today as investors couldn't
resist cashing in some gains from the recent rise in high-tech
issues. Financial stocks moved higher on expectations that banks
and brokerages will have big revenue gains from the market's recent
activity.
</P>
<P>
   With an hour remaining in Wall Street's regular session, the
Nasdaq composite index was up 33.31 at 5,080.17 after shifting
between positive and negative territory in earlier trading.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were also fluctuating. The Dow Jones
industrial average was down 38.47 at 9,972.26 and the Standard &AMP;
Poor's 500 index was off 2.86 at 1,398.83.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said investors were digesting the Nasdaq's recent
sprint higher. The index closed above 5,000 for the first time on
Thursday, breaching its latest thousand-point barrier just over two
months after closing above 4,000 for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said some investors were taking profits on the Nasdaq's
dramatic gains.
</P>
<P>
   CMGI was down 5~ at 139{ and Oracle was off 3 15/64 at 80 49/64.
Among Dow components, Hewlett-Packard fell 4 7/16 to 147 7/16.
</P>
<P>
   ''The market started with a bullish tone today. However, traders
were quick to take profits,'' said Alan Ackerman, senior vice
president at Fahnestock &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
   Ackerman and other analysts still expect the Nasdaq to remain
the best-performing U.S. stock index in the months to come, thanks
to big money from mutual funds and pension plans pouring into the
technology sector.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, some technology stocks continued to attract buyers. Dell
Computer rose 2 11/16 to 53[ after PaineWebber raised its rating on
the stock to ''buy.'' Biotechnology company Amgen rose 3] to 62].
</P>
<P>
   Financial shares, which have been punished recently by investors
worried about interest rates, were looking more attractive today as
the market realized that these companies are enjoying revenue
increases because of the rising volume of stock trading. American
Express rose 5 7/16 to 128 3/16, the biggest gainer among Dow
components. Merrill Lynch rose 4| to 107} and Charles Schwab rose 6
3/16 to 53[.
</P>
<P>
   First Union rose 1{ to 31{ after announcing a series of
executive changes.
</P>
<P>
   Goldman Sachs rose 9 15/16 to 117[ on volume that heavy enough
to prompt the New York Stock Exchange to ask the firm to explain
the unusual market activity. Goldman Sachs declined to comment to
the NYSE or to The Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   Consumer goods stocks continued to struggle. Dial Corp. said its
earnings for the first half of this year will be down at least 10
percent from a year ago. Its stock plunged on the news, falling 3
9/16 to 10 11/16.
</P>
<P>
   Dial was the second consumer products company to forecast
disappointing earnings this week. On Tuesday, Procter &AMP; Gamble
shook Wall Street when it announced its third-quarter earnings
would miss expectations. That sent the Dow tumbling nearly 375
points.
</P>
<P>
   ''Another consumer products company stubbed its toe and now
buyers are wary of anything in the blue-chip sector,'' Ackerman
said.
</P>
<P>
   Declining issues outnumbered decliners by a 4-to-3 margin on the
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 918.19 million
shares, up from 833.39 million shares on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies rose 4.05 to 610.10.

<HEADLINE> Israel Prepares for Lebanon Pullout  </HEADLINE>
By SARI BASHI, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   TZIPOREN, Israeli-Lebanese Border (AP) -- Amid the din of mortar
fire, Israeli soldiers unloaded concrete blocks and sandbags in
preparation for a withdrawal from Lebanon that would leave this
outpost on the front line.
</P>
<P>
   Residents of Israeli towns that hug the border are terrified the
pullout, promised by July, will leave Lebanese guerrillas on land
just yards from their homes, orchards and highways.
</P>
<P>
   That fear is behind an Israeli decision to retain a few points
like Tziporen -- technically inside Lebanon -- as a strategic zone to
protect the villages. The decision to remain inside even a tiny
part of Lebanon, however, could give the guerrillas a pretext for
continuing their war.
</P>
<P>
   Months before Sunday's formal government decision to withdraw
from south Lebanon by July, Israel began revamping defenses made
obsolete by Israel's 18-year occupation of a wide swath of land
beyond the international border.
</P>
<P>
   Fences around towns, overgrown by weeds and partly collapsed,
are being replaced by thick walls and surveillance cameras.
Bulldozers have cleared land for bypass roads to draw traffic away
from a road that runs along the border. Soldiers have blocked
civilian cars from approaching the frontier.
</P>
<P>
   Amram Beton, a resident of the collective farm of Avivim, said
the fortifications are not enough.
</P>
<P>
   He recalled the infiltrations, shelling and shooting of his farm
in the years before Israel's 1982 invasion of Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   Beton's brother Shimon and sister Avivit, named for her
hometown, were among 12 children killed in 1972 when guerrillas
opened fire on a school bus near Avivim. Shimon was 9 and Avivit
was 7.
</P>
<P>
   The guerrillas shot from their side of the border -- adjacent to
Beton's apple orchard and just 20 yards from the main road and
entrance to the farm.
</P>
<P>
   ''What happened to my siblings can happen to my children,'' the
56-year-old father of seven said, ''unless Israel withdraws through
an agreement'' with Syria, the main power broker in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak wants to pull out troops as a
result of an agreement with Syria to rein in Iranian-backed
Hezbollah guerrillas, but has made it clear he will withdraw by
July in any case.
</P>
<P>
   A few weeks ago, Israeli experts using maps and satellite dishes
to measure exact coordinates began marking the international border
with red ribbons tied to a barbed-wire fence.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli officials have said that if Israel has to withdraw
unilaterally, it will retain border areas, estimated to total 1.2
square miles, that Lebanon claims as its own.
</P>
<P>
   Israel took some of those areas beginning in the 1960s,
following attacks on adjacent towns, while others are disputes
inherited from the British and French colonial powers that used to
rule Palestine and Lebanon. Still other discrepancies originated in
the late 1950s, when Israel began building a security fence on the
international border, but the topography did not allow the fence to
be built on the border itself.
</P>
<P>
   Deputy Defense Minister Ephraim Sneh said that even in the case
of a peace agreement, Israel would try to keep areas taken for
strategic reasons, currently marked by a fence that runs just
beyond the internationally recognized border.
</P>
<P>
   ''The present line is very convenient for the defense of our
villages along the border, and we should see if there is any way of
keeping it,'' Sneh said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   Tziporen juts out about 400 yards into Lebanon on a ridge that
overlooks much of Israel's north, particularly the collective farm
of Margoliot. The international border runs along Margoliot's fruit
orchards.
</P>
<P>
   It is not clear whether Hezbollah, whose stated goal is to oust
Israeli troops, will continue the fight after a withdrawal.
Lebanese President Emile Lahoud said Wednesday that in the absence
of a peace agreement, Lebanon will not guarantee quiet along the
border.
</P>
<P>
   Hezbollah says any arrangement that leaves Israeli soldiers
north of the international border will not be considered a
withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
   Margoliot's mayor, Yaakov Mashiach, said he understood the army
would only give up the ridge if Israeli troops withdrew from
Lebanon as part of a peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
   In any event, he said, the army will replace a rusty, abandoned
watch tower, station 100 troops in and around the 430-member
community and issue guns to adult residents.
</P>
<P>
   ''The border is 10 or 15 (yards) from the houses,'' he said,
pointing to a barbed-wire fence. ''They can hit us with stones if
they want to.''

<HEADLINE> Albright Sends Spokesman to Kosovo  </HEADLINE>
By BARRY SCHWEID, AP Diplomatic Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Secretary of State Madeleine Albright is
sending her spokesman, James P. Rubin, to Kosovo this weekend to
try to head off a new explosion of violence in the troubled
province of Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   It is an unusual but not unprecedented mission for Rubin, who
was Albright's channel last year to the Kosovo Liberation Army, the
ethnic Albanian-led guerrilla group that fought Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic's troops.
</P>
<P>
   On this three-day mission, Rubin said he would ''express our
profound concern about extremist activity on all sides'' in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   He will meet in Kosovo with ethnic Albanian officials as well as
U.S. and NATO officials in Pristina, the provincial capital, and in
other cities.
</P>
<P>
   Rubin leaves Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   It is likely to be the last major assignment for the State
Department spokesman, whose frequently televised news briefings
made him well-known internationally during last year's NATO war in
Yugoslavia. Rubin plans to leave the post next month.
</P>
<P>
   Rubin's assignment last year began quietly in France, where
negotiations in Rambouillet to end the conflict in Kosovo were
faltering. His main task in the Serbian province was to cultivate
Hashim Thaci, political leader of the Kosovo rebels.
</P>
<P>
   While Albright flew home to tend to other business, Rubin worked
with Thaci to reach terms acceptable to the peacemaking partners.
</P>
<P>
   ''Clearly, he knows I am close to the secretary of state,''
Rubin told a reporter in detailing his mission later on in
Washington. ''In that part of the world, the fact that I am on TV
means that I am the daily face of the United States. He trusted
me.''
</P>
<P>
   Rubin met with Thachi at the U.S. Embassy in Skopje, Macedonia,
and then at rebel command headquarters outside Pristina. Later, he
flew to Tirana, Albania, for talks with NATO officials, then saw
Thaci again in his mountaintop retreat.
</P>
<P>
   The mission apparently succeeded. The rebel force struck a
compromise on its demand for an army.
</P>
<P>
   Current tensions prompted European officials in Brussels,
Belgium, to consider Friday how to head off a new explosion of
violence.
</P>
<P>
   Tensions between Serbs and ethnic Albanians are on the rise,
particularly in the mixed city of Kosovska Mitrovica. But Albright
said she is not giving up on diplomacy.
</P>
<P>
   The city, 20 miles north of Pristina, has been the scene of
repeated ethnic unrest over the past several months that has
claimed several deaths and caused dozens of injuries.

<HEADLINE> Grain and Soybeans Futures Drop  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- Grain and soybean futures retreated Friday on the
Chicago Board of Trade in profit-taking ahead of the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Soybeans were pressured by crop-beneficial rains expected in key
growing regions of Brazil and Argentina this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Prices opened higher after the U.S. Department of Agriculture
reported that U.S. exports increased by 20 million bushels. But
unenthusiastic investors resisted pushing the price past $5.20 a
bushel, traders took their cue and went on a selling binge that
sent soybeans down more than 1 percent for the day.
</P>
<P>
   Wheat also tumbled in light trading, tripped up by soybeans'
decline and prospects of continuing precipitation in the U.S.
winter wheat belt over the next week.
</P>
<P>
   Corn was pressured by forecasts for two storm systems to move
across the Midwest next week.
</P>
<P>
   Wheat for May delivery fell 3\ cents to $2.60 a bushel; May corn
fell { cent to $2.26} a bushel; May oats fell 1 cent to $1.16{ a
bushel; May soybeans fell 6} cents to $5.09} a bushel.
</P>
<P>
   Beef and pork futures advanced in trading on the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   April live cattle rose .05 cent to 72.60 cents a pound; May
feeder cattle rose .07 cent to 84.77 cents a pound; April lean hogs
rose 1.30 cent to 62.05 cents a pound; May frozen pork bellies rose
.57 cent to 93.37 cents a pound.

<HEADLINE> Area hoping to base future prosperity on tourism cancels tourismshow  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW HARTFORD, N.Y. (AP) -- Even some of upstate's major tourist
destinations have better places to be this spring.
</P>
<P>
   Lack of interest by tourist attractions led the Mohawk Valley
Chamber of Commerce to cancel its Spring Tourism Expo, according to
chamber president Robert Fowler.
</P>
<P>
   ''No one wanted to participate,'' Fowler said Friday. ''We boast
that we have 100 tourist attractions and we got 34 that said yes.
And eight of those were tradeouts that don't have to pay (the $300
fee to participate).''
</P>
<P>
   That's despite the fact that the area, which includes tourist
destinations from Little Falls to Verona, is struggling with
economic decline and hoping tourism will bring future prosperity.
</P>
<P>
   The exposition attracted 6,800 people last year. This year's
show had been slated for March 18-19 at the Mohawk Valley
Convention Center.
</P>
<P>
   Oneida County Historical Society Curator Richard Aust said he
was devastated when he received word of the cancellation Thursday
morning.
</P>
<P>
   Aust said he had planned for the event since January, created
exhibits, planned two slide shows about the Hotel Utica, and
arranged to transport his displays for the event.
</P>
<P>
   ''Last spring's expo was excellent. It was a really positive
event that promoted the historical society and the area,'' Aust
said.
</P>
<P>
   Renee Scialdo Shevat, president of Herkimer Diamond Mines and
manager of Erie Canal Village, said lack of interest wasn't the
reason her businesses decided not to attend. She said her staff
spends weekends in March at regional tourism shows promoting
attractions to tourists outside the Mohawk Valley.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're doing everything we can to bring tourism to the area,''
Scialdo Shevat said. ''The last thing I would want to do is give
the impression we have given up. It's simply not true.''
</P>
<P>
   Scialdo Shevat said now is the time to promote tourism to people
outside the area, whereas late April and May is the time to promote
day trips to local residents.
</P>
<P>
   Fowler did not buy that argument.
</P>
<P>
   ''If it was held in April or May, it would be too close to
opening,'' he said. ''And if it was held in the fall it would be at
the end of the tourist season. Come on!''
</P>
<P>
   Fowler said the tourism expo originated to serve the needs of
the local tourist attractions, who he said complained there wasn't
enough marketing to Mohawk Valley residents. ''Now, I guess they're
saying they don't need the exposure,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The tourism industry here believes in promoting, whereas
individual entities do not believe in supporting promotion of
tourism in general that's going to benefit the entire region,''
Fowler said. ''It's been a problem since God created the Mohawk
Valley. For four years I've tried to develop a tourism guide to
list all the attractions, and no one will advertise in the book.
</P>
<P>
   Fort Stanwix National Monument Superintendent Gary Warshefski
said his organization didn't agree to participate in the show
because the fort doesn't open until April 1 and has noone to staff
a booth. The fort did not participate last year, either, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Vernon Downs spokesman Jim Moran said his company also didn't
take part in 1999 and didn't opt to do so this year because of a
staff reorganization. He said the track may consider it if the expo
is conducted next year.
</P>
<P>
   Fowler said the chamber won't actively seek out business to
participate in another show unless a number of the major
attractions in the region contact him and show interest.
</P>
<P>
   Other organizations that decided not to participate this year
were: Munson-Williams-Proctor Institute in Utica, National Baseball
Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, National Distance Running Hall of Fame
in Utica, and Herkimer Diamond Mines.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's mind-boggling,'' said Fowler, who owns the local
minor-league baseball team. ''They claim it's an economic
development tool and will help us through these tough times. And
yet the tourism people are so provincial it's not going to
happen.''

<HEADLINE> Congress Candidates Set Fund Record  </HEADLINE>
By JONATHAN D. SALANT, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and
California Rep. Jim Rogan -- Republicans in two of the hottest races
this fall -- led congressional candidates in last year's
record-setting fund raising.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, Senate and House candidates running in 2000 raised $317
million during 1999, a 37 percent increase over the $232 million
that candidates raised in 1997, the last year before a
congressional election.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani, expected to compete with first lady Hillary Rodham
Clinton for the seat of retiring Democratic Sen. Daniel Patrick
Moynihan of New York, raised $11.8 million, tops among Senate
candidates. Clinton was second at $8.1 million.
</P>
<P>
   On the House side, Rogan, a top target of Democrats, raised $3
million. He was one of the lawmakers who presented the case for
impeaching President Clinton to the Senate. His Democratic
opponent, California state Sen. Adam Schiff, raised more money than
any other House challenger, $1.2 million.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats hope that Rogan's district will be one of six
Republican-held seats they need to win to take back the House
majority that the GOP captured in 1994. Most of the focus will be
on 40 to 50 seats that are considered the most competitive.
</P>
<P>
   With control of the chamber at stake, House candidates raised a
record $199 million last year. That was $63 million more than they
raised in 1997, a 47 percent increase.
</P>
<P>
   ''A percentage rise of that magnitude is surprising yet
understandable,'' said Herbert Alexander, professor emeritus of
political science at the University of Southern California. ''Both
parties' incumbents and challengers will be spending massively. The
Democrats believe they can win control and the Republicans want to
retain control.''
</P>
<P>
   In all, the Senate candidates raised $118 million in 1999. In
1993, the last time these same Senate seats were on the ballot, the
candidates raised $76 million.

<HEADLINE> Bank Merger Helps Insurance Giant  </HEADLINE>
By HANS GREIMEL, AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) -- While officials Deutsche Bank AG and
Dresdner Bank AG are touting cost savings of nearly $3 billion
annually because of their pending $30 billion merger, investors
turning their backs on them -- at least for now.
</P>
<P>
   Shares in both sank Friday for a second day in a row as analysts
warned that predicted benefits from the merger would be a long time
in coming. But one company has emerged as an instant winner:
insurance giant Allianz AG.
</P>
<P>
   For Allianz -- which is taking a stake in the retail operations
Deutsche and Dresdner want to get rid of -- the merger is seen as
clearing the way for it to sell insurance policies at the corner
bank and establish itself as Germany's dominant ''bancassurer,'' a
term for rolling both busineses into one.
</P>
<P>
   Its shares closed up 4.20 euros, or 1 percent, at 411.20 euros
($398.86) in Frankfurt.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, analysts at HSBC Holdings, Credit Suisse First
Boston, and Credit Lyonnais downgraded their ratings on either
Deutsche Bank, Dresdner or both -- saying Thursday's merger adds
little value to the banks because they have major overlapping
operations.
</P>
<P>
   Shares in Deutsche Bank fell 7.5 percent Friday closing down
6.06 euros to 74.75 euros ($72.50), while Dresdner Bank fell 3.85
euros, or 7.7 percent to 46.15 euros ($44.77).
</P>
<P>
   As part of the deal, the two German banks will separate their
combined retail banking unit, to be named Bank 24, and take it
public in three years. Allianz, which owns stakes in both banks,
will get a minority stake in the retail service, which could grow
into a majority holding.
</P>
<P>
   That would allow Allianz, the world's second largest insurer
behind French company AXA, to market its insurance policies
directly to the bank's 10 million customers. The deal also further
bolsters Allianz by giving it control of Deutsche Bank's asset
management unit, DWS Group, and its insurance branch, Deutscher
Herold.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 40 percent of the new bank's customers are expected to
bank over the Internet, which will also give Allianz an impressive
online presence.
</P>
<P>
   In that sense, analysts say Allianz was the big winner in
Thursday's bank merger.
</P>
<P>
   ''In terms of managing pensions, it could be the biggest company
in the future,'' said banking professor Wolfgang Gehrke in an
interview Friday with Berlin's Inforadio.
</P>
<P>
   Allianz said DWS should boost its asset-management portfolio by
around $91 billion to more than $727 billion, bringing it into the
top five among global fund managers.
</P>
<P>
   The deal also triggered reinsurer Munich Re to announce Thursday
that it was raising its 7 percent stake in Germany's second largest
bank, HypoVereinsbank, in an attempt to counter Allianz and give it
better channels to hawk its own insurance.
</P>
<P>
   This is not the first time insurance has been sold through
German banks. Over the past couple years, Dresdner Bank,
HypoVereinsbank and Volksbank have dabbled in selling insurance
from the tellers' booths -- but with limited success.
</P>
<P>
   ''There has been talk for years and years in Germany about
combining banking and insurance under one roof, but it has never
worked, because the people in banks don't always have the expertise
to sell insurance,'' said Heidi Sherman, chief economist with the
business think tank Ifo.
</P>
<P>
   Allianz chairman Henning Schulte-Noelle dismissed talk about the
company taking a full dive into the world of banking.
</P>
<P>
   ''With our stake in Bank 24, Allianz isn't going into the
banking business. Just as before, it isn't our intention,'' he said
at a news conference Thursday in the company's Munich headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   Sherman suggested that to be successful, Allianz would have to
capitalize on its strengths as an insurer -- adding that passively
making it available through banks or over the Internet may actually
be more attractive to customers than the traditional, high-pressure
approach of door-to-door sales.

<HEADLINE> DOT Awards Records Systems Grants  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Transportation Department said Friday it
was awarding $7.6 million in grants to improve traffic records
systems in 46 states.
</P>
<P>
   ''These grants will help improve safety, which is President
Clinton's and Vice President Gore's highest transportation
priority,'' Transportation Secretary Rodney Slater said. ''Improved
data will lead to better decisions in both government and industry
on vehicle and highway safety issues.''
</P>
<P>
   States use their record systems to identify problem
intersections, risk-prone drivers and priorities for law
enforcement.
</P>
<P>
   The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration grants are a
part of the Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century which
provides $32 million over a five-year period, the department said
in a written statement.
</P>
<P>
   Forty-one states will receive $143,000 each to improve existing
records systems. Five others will get $96,480 each to develop
records systems.

<HEADLINE> Nasdaq Is Up 33.31; Dow Off 38.47  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were mixed today as investors couldn't
resist cashing in some gains from the recent rise in high-tech
issues. Financial stocks moved higher on expectations that banks
and brokerages will have big revenue gains from the market's recent
activity.
</P>
<P>
   With an hour remaining in Wall Street's regular session, the
Nasdaq composite index was up 33.31 at 5,080.17 after shifting
between positive and negative territory in earlier trading.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were also fluctuating. The Dow Jones
industrial average was down 38.47 at 9,972.26 and the Standard &AMP;
Poor's 500 index was off 2.86 at 1,398.83.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said investors were digesting the Nasdaq's recent
sprint higher. The index closed above 5,000 for the first time on
Thursday, breaching its latest thousand-point barrier just over two
months after closing above 4,000 for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said some investors were taking profits on the Nasdaq's
dramatic gains.
</P>
<P>
   CMGI was down 5~ at 139{ and Oracle was off 3 15/64 at 80 49/64.
Among Dow components, Hewlett-Packard fell 4 7/16 to 147 7/16.
</P>
<P>
   ''The market started with a bullish tone today. However, traders
were quick to take profits,'' said Alan Ackerman, senior vice
president at Fahnestock &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
   Ackerman and other analysts still expect the Nasdaq to remain
the best-performing U.S. stock index in the months to come, thanks
to big money from mutual funds and pension plans pouring into the
technology sector.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, some technology stocks continued to attract buyers. Dell
Computer rose 2 11/16 to 53[ after PaineWebber raised its rating on
the stock to ''buy.'' Biotechnology company Amgen rose 3] to 62].
</P>
<P>
   Financial shares, which have been punished recently by investors
worried about interest rates, were looking more attractive today as
the market realized that these companies are enjoying revenue
increases because of the rising volume of stock trading. American
Express rose 5 7/16 to 128 3/16, the biggest gainer among Dow
components. Merrill Lynch rose 4| to 107} and Charles Schwab rose 6
3/16 to 53[.
</P>
<P>
   First Union rose 1{ to 31{ after announcing a series of
executive changes.
</P>
<P>
   Goldman Sachs rose 9 15/16 to 117[ on volume that heavy enough
to prompt the New York Stock Exchange to ask the firm to explain
the unusual market activity. Goldman Sachs declined to comment to
the NYSE or to The Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   Consumer goods stocks continued to struggle. Dial Corp. said its
earnings for the first half of this year will be down at least 10
percent from a year ago. Its stock plunged on the news, falling 3
9/16 to 10 11/16.
</P>
<P>
   Dial was the second consumer products company to forecast
disappointing earnings this week. On Tuesday, Procter &AMP; Gamble
shook Wall Street when it announced its third-quarter earnings
would miss expectations. That sent the Dow tumbling nearly 375
points.
</P>
<P>
   ''Another consumer products company stubbed its toe and now
buyers are wary of anything in the blue-chip sector,'' Ackerman
said.
</P>
<P>
   Declining issues outnumbered decliners by a 4-to-3 margin on the
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 918.19 million
shares, up from 833.39 million shares on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies rose 4.05 to 610.10.

	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- Advocates for a state holiday to honor
Harriet Tubman commemorated the anniversary of her death Friday by

   Tubman led more than 300 slaves to freedom along the Underground

<HEADLINE> Veteran Lawyer To Head Tobacco Suit  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A 17-year Justice Department attorney was
picked Friday to head the trial team for the government's massive
lawsuit against the tobacco industry.
</P>
<P>
   Sharon Y. Eubanks, who had been deputy chief of the litigation
team, was promoted to the top job for the lawsuit, which is
expected to go to trial in January 2003.
</P>
<P>
   The government accuses cigarette makers of conspiring for 45
years to mislead the public about the dangers of smoking and seeks
to recover billions of dollars spent by Medicare and other federal
health programs to treat smoking-induced illnesses.
</P>
<P>
   Eubanks joined the department's civil division in 1983 and was
handling complex commercial litigation as deputy director of the
commercial litigation branch from 1995 until she joined the tobacco
team.
</P>
<P>
   There are currently 15 lawyers on the team, a number expected to
grow as the trial date approaches.
</P>
<P>
   ''Sharon has been a key leader of this team,'' said acting
Assistant Attorney General David W. Ogden, head of the civil
division, in announcing her promotion.
</P>
<P>
   She succeeds J. Patrick Glynn, who returns to his previous post
as director for environmental torts in the civil division's torts
branch.

<HEADLINE> Wheat, Soybeans Fall  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- Grain and soybean futures retreated Friday on the
Chicago Board of Trade in profit-taking ahead of the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Soybeans were pressured by crop-beneficial rains expected in key
growing regions of Brazil and Argentina this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Prices opened higher after the U.S. Department of Agriculture
reported that U.S. exports increased by 20 million bushels. But
unenthusiastic investors resisted pushing the price past $5.20 a
bushel, traders took their cue and went on a selling binge that
sent soybeans down more than 1 percent for the day.
</P>
<P>
   Wheat also tumbled in light trading, tripped up by soybeans'
decline and prospects of continuing precipitation in the U.S.
winter wheat belt over the next week.
</P>
<P>
   Corn was pressured by forecasts for two storm systems to move
across the Midwest next week.
</P>
<P>
   Wheat for May delivery fell 3\ cents to $2.60 a bushel; May corn
fell { cent to $2.26} a bushel; May oats fell 1 cent to $1.16{ a
bushel; May soybeans fell 6} cents to $5.09} a bushel.
</P>
<P>
   Beef and pork futures advanced in trading on the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   April live cattle rose .05 cent to 72.60 cents a pound; May
feeder cattle rose .07 cent to 84.77 cents a pound; April lean hogs
rose 1.30 cent to 62.05 cents a pound; May frozen pork bellies rose
.57 cent to 93.37 cents a pound.

<HEADLINE> World Bank Likely To OK Iran Loan  </HEADLINE>
By HARRY DUNPHY, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Two loans to Iran, the first in seven years,
are likely to be approved soon by the World Bank over U.S.
opposition, bank officials and representatives of other countries
say.
</P>
<P>
   Bank and Iranian officials plan a final round of negotiations in
Paris before the end of the month on the $231 million package, bank
officials said. If the talks succeed, the two projects will go
before the bank's 24 executive directors, including Jan Piercy, the
U.S. representative, probably next month.
</P>
<P>
   Federal law requires the United States to oppose loans by the
World Bank and other international institutions to countries listed
by the State Department as sponsors of terrorism. Iran is among
seven countries on the list.
</P>
<P>
   ''We will not support any loan to Iran that comes to the World
Bank's executive board,'' State Department spokesman James P. Rubin
said last month.
</P>
<P>
   But several prominent foreign policy analysts have urged the
Clinton administration to reconsider. Richard Haass, vice president
of the Brookings Institution in Washington, said U.S. support for
the loan package ''would send a positive message'' to Iran, where
moderates made large gains in elections last month.
</P>
<P>
   Rubin would not comment this week on a report in the Los Angeles
Times that the administration is close to a decision to lifting
economic sanctions barring Iranian carpets, caviar and pistachios.
</P>
<P>
   He said, however, ''We are looking for ways to engage Iran in a
dialogue and to recognize the important changes that are taking
place there.'' Iran has been buying U.S. agricultural and medical
products since April.
</P>
<P>
   While the United States is cautiously exploring how to engage
Iran, the European Union is taking a more aggressive approach. Two
foreign ministers from European governments have visited Iran since
the Feb. 18 elections, which the reformers won handily.
</P>
<P>
   With Japan joining the Europeans, approval of World Bank loans
over U.S. opposition would send another signal to the Iranian
moderates.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the United States is the bank's largest shareholder,
Japan and European nations who favor the Iranian projects could
override U.S. opposition to the Iranian loans. Bank officials said
this has happened before, on loans to China, for example.
</P>
<P>
   It is only when the United States actively tries to line up
opposition that loans fail to reach the board. Representatives at
the bank from European countries said there were no signs so far
the United States was mounting a campaign against the Iranian
loans. That likely reflects an easing of Washington's total
opposition, even if it maintains a public position against the
loans.
</P>
<P>
   ''My expectations are that the projects will be supported as
long as they are developmentally sound and benefit the people,''
said Myles Wickstead, the alternative British executive director.
</P>
<P>
   He said most other members of the board share this view.
</P>
<P>
   Abdullah Bouhabib, a bank spokesman, said he expected the
projects to be approved before the bank's new fiscal year begins
July 1.
</P>
<P>
   One World Bank loan of $145 million would go toward a $340
million sewage treatment project in south Tehran, a poor district
in the Iranian capital.
</P>
<P>
   The other loan, for $86.1 million, covers the bank's
contribution to a $148.7 million project to help the Iranian
government improve health care in urban and rural regions.
</P>
<P>
   The health care loan augments the last loan the bank made to
Iran, in 1993, for health care and family planning.

<HEADLINE> New Jersey senator pitches Internet privacy legislation  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN CURRAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   POMONA, N.J. (AP) -- Would you let someone follow you into a
store and keep track of what you look at or what you buy? Would you
like personal medical information about you or your loved ones
exchanged by Web site operators?
</P>
<P>
   The online equivalent of such snooping is happening every day on
the Internet, U.S. Sen. Robert Torricelli warned Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is not some abstract problem,'' Torricelli, D-N.J., told
students at the Richard Stockton College of New Jersey. ''Ninety
percent of the most popular Web sites in America do not reveal that
the information you provide them is shared with others.''
</P>
<P>
   Among them are sites patients consult for personal medical
issues, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Torricelli proposed legislation Feb. 10 called the Internet
Privacy Act that would ban retailers from sharing personal
information about customers unless the customers gave explicit
permission. As it is, many Web sites use something called
''cookies'' -- virtual tags that mark a person's computer once
they've visited the site -- to identify customers and then market to
them according to what they've bought.
</P>
<P>
   Amazon.com, for example, says on its Web site that it does not
sell, trade or rent personal information to others. But in the very
next sentence in the ''privacy'' section of the site, it says: ''We
may choose to do so in the future with trustworthy third parties,
but you can tell us not to by sending a blank e-mail message to
never@amazon.com.''
</P>
<P>
   That practice is what's known as ''opting out.''
</P>
<P>
   But it requires action by the customer, and many don't know how
to ask to be excluded, Torricelli said. It should be the other way
around, he said: A customer should have to check a box to ''opt
in,'' giving the retailer permission to trade the information.
</P>
<P>
   His bill -- one of more than six online privacy proposals
currently before Congress -- would require a Web site to notify
customers if it is gathering personally identifiable information
and to get permission from the customer.
</P>
<P>
   It would also bar a Web site from limiting access to only those
who have agreed to let the company collect or share the information
about them.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Trade Commission and some states are investigating
whether the nation's biggest online advertiser, DoubleClick Inc.,
violated consumers' privacy by implanting electronic files onto the
computer hard drives of customers in a bid to create personal
dossiers on them for marketing purposes.
</P>
<P>
   Increasingly, Internet users are worrying about such issues.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's like having Big Brother on the Internet,'' said Ian
Keogh, 22, a junior at Stockton who was one of about 60 computer
science and education majors in the classroom with Torricelli on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Torricelli insisted that his bill does not seek to get Uncle Sam
involved in the policing of the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ''One thing I don't want is a federal Internet police force. We
don't need it, we don't want it and we believe it would create more
problems than it solves,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Internet experts say lawmakers should tread carefully.
</P>
<P>
   ''We need privacy protections that don't ruin the Web
experience,'' said Ari Schwartz, a policy analyst with the Center
for Democracy and Technology in Washington. ''The Web is about user
control; that's what's made it such a success. But we have to move
past this idea that companies should have the ability to pass on
information to third parties without user control.''
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Altobelli, a spokesman for the Direct Marketing
Association, which represents some online retailers, says Web users
should have the choice to ''opt out'' but says Torricelli's plan to
put the onus on users to give permission would cripple some
retailers' efforts to reach customers.
</P>
<P>
   ''One of the things that gets lost in this debate is why do
direct marketers want this information? They want it so they can
better target offers to people they believe will be interested in
them, so people will get offers that interest them but not those
that don't. We think that by creating an 'opt-in' environment, you
make it much harder for marketers to find their market,'' Altobelli
said.

<HEADLINE> Mozambique Faces New Danger in Mines  </HEADLINE>
By GREG MYRE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   CMOAMBA, Mozambique (AP) -- With his mine detector humming,
Sebastian Mauricio drops to his knees and sifts through the soggy
soil inch by inch for 10 minutes before deciding it's a false lead
-- nothing more than natural metals in riverbank sand. He advances
another yard.
</P>
<P>
   Even in the best of times, finding the estimated 2 million mines
left over from Mozambique's 16-year civil war is painstaking work.
Now, the job has been made even more complicated -- and dangerous --
by the surging flood waters that almost certainly uprooted
thousands of mines and washed them downstream.
</P>
<P>
   ''Everything has changed,'' said Donald Steinberg, President
Clinton's special representative for global demining.
</P>
<P>
   ''How far did the mines move?'' said Jackie D'Almeida, a
mine-clearing expert in Mozambique. ''We have no way of knowing.''
</P>
<P>
   D'Almeida leads a 500-man team that has been steadily removing
and deactivating mines since shortly after the war ended in 1992.
Their years of toil have uncovered 13,000 mines -- and about 10
million pieces of harmless metal -- in this southeast African nation
nearly twice the size of California.
</P>
<P>
   The work has also made 2,500 miles of roads safe for Mozambicans
to go to their fields.
</P>
<P>
   But in the last three weeks, heavy rains have pounded the land
and rivers overflowed their banks. Aid workers expect a death toll
in the thousands. Up to a million Mozambicans lost their homes,
crops or other property. The rains that temporarily halted relief
efforts let up Friday, permitting helicopters and airplanes to
deliver aid to hundreds of thousands of flood victims.
</P>
<P>
   More than 1,000 minefields had been identified across
Mozambique. D'Almeida said the floods submerged perhaps 100 of
them, but his team has not been able to reach remote areas where
mines are reported to have shifted.
</P>
<P>
   It is clear, however, that much of the team's efforts to map the
fields now may be essentially worthless.
</P>
<P>
   Gone now are the sticks that once marked the minefields, along
with the red-and-white signposts emblazoned with a skull and
crossbones. More importantly, the demining teams have no idea where
the old mines will be once the waters subside.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is going to be a nightmare for us,'' D'Almeida said.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, several mine clearers and two U.S.-trained German
shepherd dogs were trying to establish an explosive-free corridor
to reach downed power pylons along the Nkomati River, northwest of
the capital Maputo.
</P>
<P>
   The river's muddy waters have receded, but lurking in the mud
and shallow ponds may be land mines washed from upstream. Workers
have refused to erect new pylons until the ground is swept for
mines.
</P>
<P>
   ''Normally, mines are put in a place that makes rational
military sense, and when you find the field, you can fence it
off,'' said Jacob Kaarsbo, who helps run the mine clearing project
for the U.N. Development Program.
</P>
<P>
   Not so in Mozambique -- during the civil war, the government army
and rebel fighters sowed land mines indiscriminately and left no
records or maps of their location.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, minefields claim the limbs and lives of the most
innocent: women and children working and playing. Shortly after the
war, there were an average of 40 mine accidents a month, and about
15 were fatal. More than 7,000 Mozambicans have been fitted with
prostheses after land mines claimed their limbs.
</P>
<P>
   The mine-clearing effort, combined with an extensive education
campaign, had recently reduced the number of accidents to about
four a month.
</P>
<P>
   As flood survivors return to their previously safe homes and
fields, that is likely to change soon, Steinberg said by telephone
from Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ''They are going to cause a huge problem. We will have
accidents. No question.''

<HEADLINE> Kidnapped Girl's Mom Thanks All  </HEADLINE>
By VICKIE CHACHERE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, Fla. (AP) -- The mother of a 10-year-old girl who was
snatched from her driveway and held for three days thanked the
child's captor Friday for releasing her alive.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators continued to hunt for the kidnapper and released
no details of what happened to Jessica Rodriguez during her
captivity.
</P>
<P>
   Jessica had been abducted by a man Monday after getting off her
school bus outside her rural home in Trenton. On Thursday, she
walked into a Wal-Mart 25 miles away from home, asking for help.
Investigators said they believe the child was dropped off by her
captor.
</P>
<P>
   ''I want to tell the man who had Jessica, 'Thank you very much
for dropping her off safely,''' said her mother, Jennifer Graham,
mixing laughter and tears. ''And she's doing great. She's playing.
She's so happy. She's wonderful.''
</P>
<P>
   Investigators are focusing their search for the kidnapper in the
area around where the Jessica lives, based on information from the
girl. They would not divulge the information and declined to
comment about whether she had been assaulted.
</P>
<P>
   Jessica told investigators that she had never seen her abductor
before, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   ''She was able to give us a lot of details and is a very strong
and encouraging young witness,'' Sheriff David Turner said on ABC's
''Good Morning America.'' ''According to her, he was a stranger.
She did not know him by name. Or could not believe that she had
ever seen him previously.''
</P>
<P>
   The suspect was described as a balding man in his 30s, with a
thin face, and a tattoo of a heart with a broken arrow on his left
forearm. Police believe he is still driving the green Jeep Cherokee
Jessica's sisters described seeing on the day of the abduction.
</P>
<P>
   ''Somewhere out there is someone who fits this physical
description,'' said Ken Tucker, regional director for the Florida
Department of Law Enforcement. ''They are driving a green Jeep;
they probably haven't been at work this week. They probably have
been acting a little strange.''
</P>
<P>
   In the days after the girl vanished, her mother and aunts made
public pleas for her return as her uncles scoured the woods for the
girl.
</P>
<P>
   ''I want to thank everybody, I want to thank the media for
putting it all out there and bringing my daughter back home to me
because everybody has been a very big help,'' Graham told
reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Graham said she had talked to her children about stranger
abduction, telling them if it ever happened to them to stay focused
and aware of what was going on so they could help police later.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am very concerned about my children,'' Graham said. ''I want
the best for my kids and I still believe to this day that we live
in a very good place to raise children.''

Comptroller: State not improving oversight of child protective
agencies
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- State Comptroller H. Carl McCall charged
Friday that his recommendations for improving oversight of social
service districts are not being followed, leaving room for abused,
neglected, and troubled children to fall through the cracks.
</P>
<P>
   In March 1998, a comptroller's audit concluded that caseloads
far exceeded national standards, with some of the 58 local social
service districts reporting caseloads as high as 86 cases per
worker. McCall compared that with the 17-caseload maximum
recommended by the Child Welfare League of America.
</P>
<P>
   Officials with the state's Department of Children and Family
Planning countered that they could not mandate staffing levels on
counties, which would have to pay for the staffing.
</P>
<P>
   Still, McCall said the state could take the lead in monitoring
district staffing and update standards set in 1969. That set the
standard for preventive services between 20 and 60 children per
caseworker and the standard for foster care at a maximum of 50
children per caseworker.
</P>
<P>
   McCall said that although some improvements have been made in
caseworker training, his recommendations to the state to establish
a tracking system and upgrade their own staffing levels were going
unheeded.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Van Slyke, spokesman for the Department of Children and
Family Services, said that many of the recommendations had already
been implemented.
</P>
<P>
   ''And he knows that,'' Van Slyke said of the comptroller.
''Apparently he finds it personally expedient to politicize child
welfare.''

<HEADLINE> Stocks Close Mixed on Wall Street  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were mixed today as consumer products
shares dropped on another warning of disappointing earnings and
investors cashed in some gains from the recent rally in high-tech
issues.
</P>
<P>
   According to preliminary calculations, the Dow Jones industrial
average fell 81.91 to 9,928.82, capping a highly volatile week. The
Dow fell 438.38 points since Monday, a loss of 4.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq composite index, which fluctuated between gains and
losses throughout the session, finished up 2.20 at 5,049.06,
setting a record close by the slimmest of margins.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were mixed.
</P>
<P>
   Consumer products stocks struggled after Dial Corp. said its
earnings for the first half of this year will be down at least 10
percent from a year ago. Its stock plunged on the news.
</P>
<P>
   Dial was the second consumer products maker to forecast
disappointing earnings this week. On Tuesday, Procter &AMP; Gamble
shook Wall Street when it announced its third-quarter earnings
would miss expectations. That sent the Dow tumbling nearly 375
points.
</P>
<P>
   ''Another consumer products company stubbed its toe and now
buyers are wary of anything in the blue-chip sector,'' said Alan
Ackerman, senior vice president at Fahnestock &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
   Blue chip stocks have been most heavily affected by investors'
fears that the Federal Reserve will continue raising interest rates
this year to combat inflation. In a reversal of old expectations,
investors now feel that the slower growth rates of industrial
companies will leave them most vulnerable to higher interest rates,
which generally cut into corporate profits.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's put all of the old-line cyclical stocks under severe
pressure while the Nasdaq has gone screaming out to new highs,''
said Ricky Harrington, technical analyst at Wachovia Securities in
Charlotte, N.C.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq's sprint to 5,000 this week prompted many investors
to take a step back today. The index closed above 5,000 for the
first time on Thursday, breaching its latest thousand-point barrier
just over two months after closing above 4,000 for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said some investors were taking profits on the Nasdaq's
dramatic gains.
</P>
<P>
   CMGI and Oracle fell. Among Dow components, Hewlett-Packard
fell.
</P>
<P>
   ''The market started with a bullish tone today. However, traders
were quick to take profits,'' Ackerman said.
</P>
<P>
   Ackerman and other analysts still expect the Nasdaq to remain
the best-performing U.S. stock index in the months to come, thanks
to big money from mutual funds and pension plans pouring into the
technology sector.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, some technology stocks continued to attract buyers. Dell
Computer rose after PaineWebber raised its rating on the stock to
''buy.'' Biotechnology company Amgen also gained.
</P>
<P>
   Financial shares, which have been punished recently by investors
worried about interest rates, were looking more attractive today as
the market realized that these companies are enjoying revenue
increases because of the rising volume of stock trading. American
Express was the biggest gainer among Dow components. Merrill Lynch
and Charles Schwab rose.
</P>
<P>
   Goldman Sachs rose sharply on volume that heavy enough to prompt
the New York Stock Exchange to ask the firm to explain the unusual
market activity. Goldman Sachs declined to comment to the NYSE or
to The Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   According to preliminary calculations, the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500
fell 6.62 to 1,395.07.
</P>
<P>
   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by an 11-to-8 margin on
the New York Stock Exchange, with 1,714 down, 1,254 up and 518
unchanged.
</P>
<P>
   NYSE volume totaled 1.13 billion shares as of 4 p.m., vs. 1.12
billion in the previous session.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies fell 2.23 to 603.82.

<HEADLINE> Campaign 2000: The Thrill Is Gone  </HEADLINE>
By CALVIN WOODWARD, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Ho hum. From watching ''evil'' being shot out
of the sky, it's back to swatting flies.
</P>
<P>
   With John ''Luke Skywalker'' McCain grounded, the sizzle seems
gone from the presidential race. The spectacle of Republicans and
Democrats eating their own is over. The record-busting voter
turnouts are history.
</P>
<P>
   ''Nobody cares,'' said election judge Clayton Hurst in Salt Lake
City. He watched GOP primary voters trickle in at a pace of one
every 20 minutes Friday as people in three Western states filed in
light numbers to polling booths or caucuses. Hurst brought a book
to kill time.
</P>
<P>
   Melia Hadley, 29, an independent from Salt Lake City, looked
over the ballot and decided not to vote. ''I was thrilled with
McCain,'' she said. ''He lit the fire in my belly about politics
again.''
</P>
<P>
   Republican Gov. George W. Bush and Democratic Vice President Al
Gore haven't been lighting many fires like that.
</P>
<P>
   How quickly it all changed: from ''Star Wars'' imagery and movie
theater-type lineups to ''My Dinner with Andre,'' -- two guys
talking, and please pass the wine.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's insurgent Republican candidacy brought hordes of
previously apathetic citizens out to do what so many had never done
before -- vote for a Republican, or vote at all. He mobilized the
people who liked him and those who wanted to stop him in his
tracks.
</P>
<P>
   Fascinating, lifelong Democrat Tom Gregg of Kansas City, Mo.,
concluded on Super Tuesday. ''The whole thing between Bush and
McCain is fascinating.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, the whole thing between two leaden candidates is
somniferous.
</P>
<P>
   At one downtown Salt Lake City precinct, eight voters showed up
in six hours.
</P>
<P>
   Still, officials tending the two-party primaries Friday in Utah
and Colorado, as well as GOP caucuses and a straw poll in Wyoming,
put on a brave face.
</P>
<P>
   ''It'll be worth as much as it was last time,'' offered Brian
Lovett, chairman of Laramie County Republicans in Wyoming. ''Alan
Keyes hasn't dropped out yet.''
</P>
<P>
   In Utah, election judge Dixie Sloan said turnout was ''very
poor'' -- perhaps 10 percent of normal in the early going.
</P>
<P>
   ''The voice of the West will be heard,'' Utah Gov. Mike Leavitt,
a backer of Texas Gov. George W. Bush, said optimistically as he
cast his ballot, leaving it unclear who's listening.
</P>
<P>
   In Colorado, officials hoped they could exceed the 10 percent
turnout registered in 1996, but knew it would be a struggle.
</P>
<P>
   Although Bill Bradley stirred up some excitement of his own in
taking on fellow Democrat Al Gore, an analysis of voter
participation credits McCain with getting Americans out to vote in
large numbers.
</P>
<P>
   ''The story of this primary season was McCain,'' says Curtis
Gans of the Committee for the Study of the American Electorate.
</P>
<P>
   Gans' study found Republican turnout hit record highs in 13 of
18 states that voted through Super Tuesday while Democratic turnout
was the second lowest in 40 years.
</P>
<P>
   Republican participation overall was the highest it's been since
another Arizona maverick, Sen. Barry Goldwater, ran and won in
1964.
</P>
<P>
   Whether he was winning or losing, McCain put on a show.
</P>
<P>
   He routed Bush in New Hampshire and won Michigan thanks to
independents and Democrats. He went down hotheaded in South
Carolina and Virginia, at one point attacking ''evil'' in the
leadership of the religious right.
</P>
<P>
   When Tuesday's series of primaries and caucuses was over, his
lasers were spent.
</P>
<P>
   Too bad, Dana Hadley, assistant town administrator in
Peterborough, N.H., thought Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ''He did generate a lot of excitement,'' Hadley said. Now,
''it's kind of a done deal.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain liked to talk about how he got 40 people to come out in
Peterborough last summer, when he handed out free ice cream, and
how 400 showed up for him there in December, with no freebies.
</P>
<P>
   Two days before the New Hampshire primary, about 1,500 jammed
Peterborough's town center to see him, spilling out into the
streets, in a community of 6,000. About 70 percent of the town's
eligible voters cast ballots on primary day, overwhelmingly for
McCain.
</P>
<P>
   ''We got a lot of attention from him,'' Hadley said. ''When
you're nurtured, you respond.''

<HEADLINE> Not All Welcome Israel Pullout Plans  </HEADLINE>
By SUSAN SEVAREID, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   MARJAYOUN, Lebanon (AP) -- For eight years, Forces Shoe Store has
cared for the feet of Christians and Muslims alike in this southern
Lebanese town -- all the hiking boots are built sturdily for the
hilly terrain and all come from Israel.
</P>
<P>
   It hasn't been easy trading in shoes purchased from what many
consider the enemy, says owner Sabh Suleiman, who speaks vaguely of
an ''accident'' that left a dent visible beneath his close-cropped
hair. If Israel pulls out of Lebanon in July as planned, he says
things will get worse.
</P>
<P>
   ''Maybe I'll be dead,'' the 33-year-old Christian said, adding
that he will try to leave Lebanon for the sake of his three
children.
</P>
<P>
   The Lebanese government, many Lebanese, the rest of the Arab
world and the United Nations all demand that Israel withdraw its
troops. But the issue is more complicated in southern towns like
Marjayoun, headquarters of the Israeli-allied South Lebanon Army
militia.
</P>
<P>
   Here, Israel has built schools and paved roads, and Israeli
products are found on supermarket shelves. A few Lebanese travel to
Israel to work in agriculture or construction. Salaries Israel pays
militia fighters support the local economy in the zone, where some
120,000 people live.
</P>
<P>
   Some who criticize Suleiman for selling shoes from Israel still
come in to buy because Forces has the best prices and quality
around.
</P>
<P>
   Residents of Marjayoun, a town of 7,000, aren't sure what to
expect if Israel withdraws, particularly if its forces leave
without a peace agreement with Syria, the main power broker in
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   Israel-Syria peace talks stalled in January. The Israeli Cabinet
voted Sunday to pull out of Lebanon by July -- with or without an
agreement with Syria.
</P>
<P>
   Israel's 1,500 soldiers occupy 10 percent of Lebanese territory,
aided by the 2,500-member South Lebanon Army militia. Israel set up
the zone in 1985 with the aim of preventing cross-border guerrilla
attacks.
</P>
<P>
   Christians in the border zone first carried arms to fight
Palestinian guerrillas in the late 1970s. When the Israeli army
invaded Lebanon in 1982, many Christians saw themselves as allies
of Israel against Muslim militias and Palestinian guerrillas. A
Muslim onslaught followed the withdrawal of Israeli forces from
central Lebanon in 1983-85.
</P>
<P>
   Hezbollah, the main Shiite Muslim guerrilla fighting force, has
said it will not reconcile with anyone who fought with Israel but
hasn't said how it will deal with those with other sorts of
contacts. Under Lebanese law, any contact with the enemy is a
crime.
</P>
<P>
   Some Christians fear their religion alone could make them
targets once Israel withdraws, even though sectarian animosity has
diminished 10 years after the end of a 15-year civil war between
Christians and Muslims. Others simply don't want to be in the
middle of what could become a bloodbath if there is no peace
agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't want to stay here. I can't. First thing, because I am
a Christian -- that is enough,'' Suleiman said. ''Tel Aviv would be
good, but I will look for better, maybe Canada, maybe the United
States -- wherever they will take us.''
</P>
<P>
   Israeli Deputy Defense Minister Ephraim Sneh has said Israel
will not offer SLA members asylum, though the government has
promised not to abandon them or their families. There have been
unconfirmed reports that some militiamen could get asylum
elsewhere, particularly France.
</P>
<P>
   But for residents who did not fight with the SLA the future is
even less clear.
</P>
<P>
   Ali Sammour, a 48-year-old Muslim mechanic from nearby Khiam
village, is looking for a country that will take him, his wife and
four sons. He said he visited the embassies of Australia and Qatar,
where he worked for eight years, but ''nobody gave any visas.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Nobody knows what is going to happen,'' Sammour said. ''But
most of the people are very scared about the situation -- whether to
move, whether to stay.''
</P>
<P>
   Naamat Qassem is worried but determined to stay. She and her
husband, Abbas, a produce vendor, have six children and she fears
already difficult economic times will get worse once Israel leaves.
</P>
<P>
   ''I would like to stay at home,'' she said. ''It is my home -- I
put my blood and money into my home.''

<HEADLINE> Dollar Mixed in Quiet Session  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- The dollar was mixed Friday against major
currencies, gaining versus the euro but falling against the yen.
</P>
<P>
   In late New York trading, the euro was quoted at 96.16 cents,
down from 96.75 cents late Thursday. The dollar also was quoted at
106.22 Japanese yen, down from 106.46.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said Friday's session was quiet, a fitting ending to a
mild week in the foreign exchange markets.
</P>
<P>
   ''We ended the week pretty much where we began,'' said Jeff
Caringola, a foreign exchange trader at First Union National Bank
in Charlotte, N.C.
</P>
<P>
   Caringola said the dollar seems no longer tied to fluctuations
in the U.S. stock market. Volatility in stocks has apparently been
a byproduct of money moving from one sector to another, and not a
result of international cash flowing into the U.S., he said.
</P>
<P>
   If the latter were the case, it would push the dollar up against
all major currencies. Instead, the dollar has been reacting to
isolated economic conditions and projections overseas.
</P>
<P>
   The yen continued its upward momentum against the dollar Friday,
despite the lingering threat of the Bank of Japan, as investors
remain optimistic about that country's economy.
</P>
<P>
   In other trading, the dollar was quoted at 1.6730 Swiss francs,
up from 1.6608, and 1.4580 Canadian dollars, down slightly from
1.4582. The British pound fell to $1.5768 from $1.5823.
</P>
<P>
   Currencies of the 11 countries participating in the euro are no
longer traded separately and are tied to the euro by a fixed rate.
</P>
<P>
   Based on Thursday's euro rate, the dollar was worth: 2.0333
German marks, up from 2.0215; 6.8194 French francs, up from 6.7799;
and 2,012.96 Italian lire, up from 2,001.31.

<HEADLINE> More Listeria Cases Found in France  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS (AP) -- Health authorities said Friday they have found
three more cases in a listeria poisoning outbreak that has now
affected 32 people.
</P>
<P>
   The Health Ministry said in a statement that two adults and a
pregnant woman have been contaminated by the same strain of the
potentially deadly bacteria. The disease caused the pregnant woman
to miscarry.
</P>
<P>
   Since it began in November, the outbreak has caused seven deaths
and several miscarriages or stillbirths.
</P>
<P>
   Officials have said a traditional specialty -- pork tongue in
gelatin -- was the likely culprit in the outbreak. They have not
isolated the factory where the meat was produced.
</P>
<P>
   Healthy people rarely contract listeriosis, which can cause high
fever, severe headaches, neck stiffness and nausea. It can be
potentially fatal to people with weak immune systems -- infants, the
elderly, chemotherapy patients and people with HIV infections or
other chronic diseases.
</P>
<P>
   Listeriosis can incubate for up to eight weeks.

<HEADLINE> John Major Won't Run for Parliament  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- Former Tory Prime Minister John Major, who led
Britain's government from 1990 to 1997, said Friday that he has
decided not to run for parliament in the next general election.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to the Huntingdon Conservative Association, the
56-year-old Major said he had made his decision after ''a great
deal of soul-searching and sadness.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I would rather go while I am being urged to stay, rather than
stay beyond the time when I should go,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Major became prime minister in 1990 after Margaret Thatcher and
was soon dubbed ''The Man Who Came to Dither'' because of his
lackluster style.
</P>
<P>
   Major shone during the 1992 general election, however, leading
the conservatives to victory, denouncing right-wingers in his
Cabinet and facing up to Euro-skeptic members of his party.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, in the face of internal party turmoil, Major resigned
and threw down the gauntlet to all challengers. In the end, Major
retained the party leadership.
</P>
<P>
   Victory was short-lived. The party never recovered from
allegations of Tory sleaze and financial corruption and, after 18
years of conservative rule, Major led the party to its disastrous
defeat in May 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Major will perhaps be best remembered for the advances he made
towards Northern Ireland peace, paving the way for the Good Friday
Agreement of 1998. That agreement designed the local power-sharing
government that gave the province partial home rule briefly this
winter.
</P>
<P>
   Former Irish Prime Minister Albert Reynolds, who worked with
Major on the peace process, described him as a ''great public
servant.''
</P>
<P>
   ''He was crucial in helping to build the peace process. He
worked very hard and genuinely wanted to make it succeed,''
Reynolds said.
</P>
<P>
   Major reportedly has told friends he has not decided what to do
professionally after he leaves government.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have served in parliament for over 20 years and politics has
been an important part of my life for far longer, but it is not all
my life and it is time to enjoy the many other aspects that have
been subordinated over so many years,'' Major said in his letter.
''My family has sacrificed much for politics and it is now time for
politics to make way.''
</P>
<P>
   Tory leader William Hague said the party was saddened to hear of
Major's decision.
</P>
<P>
   ''As prime minister for seven years, he will be remembered for
the golden economic legacy from which we are still benefiting ...
and for his tireless efforts and determination to bring peace to
Northern Ireland which laid the foundations for the Good Friday
Agreement,'' Hague said. ''For these things and many others, the
country owes him a considerable debt.''
</P>
<P>
   Keith Stukins, chairman of the Huntingdon Conservative
Association, said Major's decision would come as ''an enormous
shock'' to members of the constituency.

<HEADLINE> Nasdaq Over 5,000 and Still Going  </HEADLINE>
By EILEEN GLANTON, AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- In the latest sign of investors' frenzy for
technology, the Nasdaq composite index vaulted past 5,000 Thursday,
slightly more than two months after it first topped 4,000. The
technology-dominated index paused today after its latest
achievement, but analysts expect it to quickly resume its advance.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq's stunning gains this year, and its seemingly
unstoppable velocity, have confirmed the index as the
top-performing and fastest-growing barometer of the U.S. stock
market.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq Stock Market launched the composite index 29 years
ago as a way to measure the progress of fledgling companies too
small or weak for the prestigious New York Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, the index closed above 5,000 for the first time
after soaring 149.60 points Thursday to at 5,046.86. Today, the
Nasdaq fluctuated amid profit-taking and ended the session up 1.76
at 5,048.62, according to preliminary calculations.
</P>
<P>
   The index is now up 24 percent for the year, compared with a
more than 13 percent loss for its blue-chip counterpart, the Dow
Jones industrial average. The Nasdaq's velocity is unmatched, as
well; it took the Dow nearly nine months to rise from 4,000 and
5,000 in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow fell 81.91 to 9,928.82 today, unable to hold on to
earlier gains.
</P>
<P>
   While many Wall Street pros insist that round numbers like 5,000
hold no special significance, the Nasdaq's rapid growth has left
some slightly awestruck.
</P>
<P>
   ''The move up has been nothing short of scintillating,'' said
Hugh Johnson, chief investment officer at First Albany Corp.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq Stock Market began trading on Feb. 8, 1971. It was
the world's first electronic market, where traders posted their
prices on computer screens instead of haggling on a trading floor.
The new market's name, the National Association of Securities
Dealers Automated Quotation system, came from the self-regulatory
security industry group that created it.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq composite index was set up to measure all of the new
market's companies, which at the time numbered 2,500. Now about
5,000 companies trade on the Nasdaq.
</P>
<P>
   For years, most companies that grew large enough to meet the
NYSE's more stringent listing requirements moved there,
contributing to Nasdaq's longtime reputation as a second-tier
index.
</P>
<P>
   But in recent years, one-time upstarts like Microsoft and Intel
who grew into corporate mammoths chose to stay put, even as their
market capitalizations -- the total dollar value of their shares --
soared. Last year, those two technology bellwethers were added to
the Dow Jones industrial average -- the first two Nasdaq stocks to
join the prestigious list of 30 companies.
</P>
<P>
   The shining performance of the Nasdaq has provided the only real
light for investors this year. The market is constantly expanding
with new stocks that tap into investor obsession with anything
having to do with computers, telecommunications, biotechnology and,
of course, the Internet -- all of which have come symbolize the
''new economy.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, most other stocks have been stuck in a narrow range,
hemmed in by worries about inflation and rising interest rates.
Blue-chip stocks -- the manufacturers, transportation, financial and
other companies of the ''old economy'' -- have been especially
moribund.
</P>
<P>
   On the surface, the Nasdaq's leap from 4,000 to 5,000 looks much
like its jump from 3,000 to 4,000. The index crossed its latest
thousand-point milestone in 46 trading sessions, compared with 39
sessions between 3,000 and 4,000.
</P>
<P>
   Both advances came in narrow markets, with a relative handful of
stocks contributing most of the gains. And both advances featured
fierce volatility, indicating to most market watchers that
short-term traders were largely responsible for the Nasdaq's
growing dominance.
</P>
<P>
   But there are some significant differences.
</P>
<P>
   First off, the large-capitalization companies that led the
Nasdaq's push to 4,000 have cooled a bit. Instead, investors are
seeking out new opportunities in the semiconductor and
biotechnology sectors. Human Genome Sciences, which uses genetic
research to develop drugs, has more than doubled since the start of
the year and now trades over $177 a share.
</P>
<P>
   More fundamentally, investors have embraced technology stocks as
the companies most likely to succeed if the Federal Reserve
continues raising interest rates to cool the fast-growing economy
and prevent inflation. That's a dramatic change from last year,
when many investors feared that younger tech companies would be
crippled by higher interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is now a belief that technology stocks are immune to
swings in interest rates and the business cycle in general,''
Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   That's because technology carries the promise of helping all
types of companies improve productivity, analysts said. Also these
companies don't depend as much on borrowing from banks to develop
their businesses, relying more on investors and venture
capitalists.
</P>
<P>
   ''Productivity is key to improving real standards of living and
keeping inflation at bay,'' said James M. Griffin Jr., chief
investment strategist at Aeltus Investment Management in Hartford,
Conn.
</P>
<P>
   Yet despite the vast promise of technology, many investors
remain leery of the sector. With their lofty valuations and
sometimes scant earnings, the stocks are prone to wild swings and
aren't for every investor.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Fertman, a 33-year-old New Yorker, said that while he owns
technology stocks, he remains fearful of their valuations.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a bubble that's about to burst,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Professional investors are nervous, too.
</P>
<P>
   ''I own them all,'' said Johnson ''They have made the difference
in my portfolios' performance. So I'm very grateful for their
extraordinary performance, but I'm also scared stiff.''

<HEADLINE> British Airways Chief Steps Down  </HEADLINE>
By BRUCE STANLEY, AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- British Airways began searching for a new chief
executive Friday, when Robert Ayling announced his surprise
resignation after four troubled years as head of Britain's largest
airline.
</P>
<P>
   Ayling said in a statement to the London Stock Exchange that the
demands of the job had ''taken their toll,'' and that it was ''time
for a new chief executive to take up the challenge.''
</P>
<P>
   British Airways chairman Lord Colin Marshall will take over as
chief executive while the airline searches for a successor. Ayling,
54, worked 15 years at British Airways.
</P>
<P>
   The airline has faced intense competition in recent years,
particularly on its trans-Atlantic routes to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Under Ayling, the airline has tried to increase its appeal to
business customers, introducing first-class sleeper beds and
increasing the number of premium seats on its flights.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, competition from low-cost airlines has
threatened British Airways on many of its shorter European routes.
BA responded by starting its own low-cost carrier, Go.
</P>
<P>
   Ayling introduced cost-cutting measures that have so far saved
the company $1.6 billion. But in November, the airline reported a
38 percent drop in profit for the previous six month period.
</P>
<P>
   Jennie Campbell, an industry analyst at London brokerage Greig
Middleton, said Ayling's resignation was a surprise, though he had
long been under pressure to step down.
</P>
<P>
   ''Everything he's done probably needed to be done,'' she said,
''but it has been a potentially dangerous strategy of concentrating
on premium passengers, which may alienate a lot of people who want
to fly.''
</P>
<P>
   British Airways also started to fly more planes on its longer,
more profitable routes, and is re-equipping its fleet with smaller
aircraft that have fewer economy-class seats.
</P>
<P>
   For BA to succeed with its new strategy, it will probably need
to cut thousands of jobs, said Alastair Gunn, a transport analyst
at Credit Lyonnais Securities Europe. Whoever succeeds Ayling,
therefore, will need ''a Ph.D. in diplomacy,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ayling, a lawyer, alienated much of BA's 60,000-strong work
force with his tough response to a cabin crew strike in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ''He was seen to be very arrogant and not the greatest of
communicators, even though, with hindsight, the strategies he put
into place very few people now disagree with,'' Gunn said.
</P>
<P>
   Among BA's setbacks during Ayling's leadership was the public
relations gaffe of dropping the traditional blue, white and red
colors of the Union Jack from the tailfins of many of its jets.
Ayling believed some customers perceived the old colors as too
stuffy and Anglocentric, and he had the planes repainted in 1997
with ethnic designs from around the world.
</P>
<P>
   Many observers derided the new paint jobs as airborne graffiti.
Former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher described them as
''awful.''
</P>
<P>
   Ayling later decided to revert to the old color scheme.
</P>
<P>
   BA shares jumped 5 percent on the London Stock Exchange on word
of Ayling's resignation.

<HEADLINE> Fires Cause Concern in Indonesia  </HEADLINE>
By DANIEL COONEY, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) -- With hundreds of blazes on the
Indonesian island of Sumatra casting haze across much of Southeast
Asia, the government on Friday said it would crack down on farmers
and loggers using fire to clear land.
</P>
<P>
   The government said it will confiscate the licenses of any
plantation owner or logger caught using fire as a cheap -- but
illegal -- method of clearing land for planting.
</P>
<P>
   ''Anyone involved in the burning should be punished,''
Indonesian Foreign Minister Alwi Shihab said. ''We will do whatever
we can... to overcome the problem.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, fires across the Indonesian archipelago produced a huge
cloud of smog that paralyzed the region for months, harming tourism
and threatening the health of millions of people in much of
Southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
   During the rule of former President Suharto, the fires were
allowed to rage unchecked because many of the owners of logging
companies and palm oil plantations had close ties with officials in
his administration.
</P>
<P>
   But the blazes severely undermined international confidence in
Suharto, who was ousted in 1998 amid public protests.
</P>
<P>
   It was unclear how effective President Abdurrahman Wahid's new
Cabinet, Indonesia's first freely elected government in 44 years,
would be in combatting the fires.
</P>
<P>
   Though clouds of smoke have blanketed much of Southeast Asia
over the past few days, Shihab said the pollution has not damaged
relations with neighboring countries.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday in Singapore, the Pollution Standards Index ranged
from 26 to 45, a level considered healthy. That figure was down
from 76 three days earlier. A reading of 50 or below is considered
good, while higher than 50 is moderate and above 100 is considered
unhealthy.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Singaporean meteorologists said the threat was far from
over, as the seasonal monsoon winds are expected to change
direction in the next few weeks -- blowing the smoke directly across
the tiny island city-state.
</P>
<P>
   Indonesia's Riau province, where many of the fires were burning,
is close to Singapore. The city-state's environment minister, Lee
Yock Suan, said this year's haze could be as bad as that of 1997.

<HEADLINE> Bike Week Death Toll in Fla. Hits 12  </HEADLINE>
By RON WORD, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- At least 12 people have been killed
in motorcycle accidents during Daytona Beach's Bike Week this year,
making it the deadliest such gathering in more than a decade.
</P>
<P>
   Some died in wrecks on rural roads on their way to the annual
event, which began in 1937 and attracts 500,000 motorcyclists from
across the country. Others were killed in collisions after
beer-filled nights of carousing.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've been here for 41 years and it's the worst I've seen it,''
said Imogene Williams, who works at the Iron Horse Saloon, a biker
watering hole. ''There are a lot more bikers than there used to
be.''
</P>
<P>
   The Florida Highway Patrol has been tracking Bike Week
fatalities since 1989. Capt. Bill Sanders blamed the increase in
accidents on the growing number of motorcyclists who attend the
event combined with more novice bikers -- plus drinking. Truckloads
of beer are consumed in a festival that has expanded from a long
weekend to a 10-day event.
</P>
<P>
   ''With motorcyclists, alcohol is always a factor,'' Sanders
said.
</P>
<P>
   The festival ends Sunday with a traditional biker parade down
Main Street. With the busiest two days left, police said they will
be out in force to try to slow bikers down.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've got to get their attention,'' Sanders said.
</P>
<P>
   Two motorcyclists died Friday in a head-on collision after one
of them went the wrong way on an interstate highway ramp.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, a motorcyclist swerved to avoid a dead bird and
collided with another biker. Both were killed. On Wednesday, three
people were killed, including a firefighter who was thrown from a
motorcycle and run over by a car.
</P>
<P>
   During last year's Bike Week, five motorcyclists died in
accidents. The deadliest previous year was 1991, when 11 bikers
died.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a tragedy. Even one death is unacceptable,'' said Kevin
Kilian, vice president of special events for the Daytona Beach
Chamber of Commerce. ''When you get 500,000 people in town, bad
things can happen. We don't have a crystal ball on how we are going
to fix it.''

<HEADLINE> Keyes Presses on As Bush's Rival  </HEADLINE>
By RON JENKINS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NORMAN, Okla. (AP) -- Doggedly refusing to consider the
Republican race settled, Alan Keyes told Oklahomans that Texas Gov.
George W. Bush can't win the presidency because he lacks the skills
to expose the ''great moral betrayal'' of the Clinton
administration.
</P>
<P>
   Ending a two-day campaign stop in the state Friday, Keyes stuck
mainly to religious and philosophical themes as he decried a
society he said is more dependent on government than God.
</P>
<P>
   Asked by a student at Oklahoma University why he had not drawn
more support from Christian conservatives such as Pat Robertson and
James Dobson, Keyes said he is still waiting for divine answers to
that question.
</P>
<P>
   But he took a shot at Robertson for selling his cable television
network to the Fox group, which he called ''the most depraved''
entertainment organization in the country.
</P>
<P>
   With John McCain having ended his campaign this week, Keyes is
the only active rival to Bush and poses no threat for the
nomination. Even so, he presses on, speaking up for religious
tenets, attacking liberals and arguing Bush can't beat Democrat Al
Gore in November.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Keyes told a news conference in Oklahoma City that
Bush cannot win because he is unable to stand up to Gore and expose
the moral failures of the Clinton administration.
</P>
<P>
   Keyes competed Friday in Republican primaries in Utah and
Colorado, and in Wyoming caucuses.
</P>
<P>
   He came into that series of contests with 12 delegates to the
617 won by Bush. In all, 1,034 delegates are needed to clinch the
nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Keyes told his university audience that America is under the
judgment of God and must turn from ''a sick, servile mentality''
that believes rights come from government.
</P>
<P>
   A fierce opponent of abortion, Keyes also said people do not
have a right to suicide because ending a life is ''God's choice.''
</P>
<P>
   On trade with China, Keyes said the United States should not be
''making deals with tyrants.''

<HEADLINE> 14-year-old boy files $15 million suit alleging hazing at footballcamp  </HEADLINE>
By JOY RUSSELL PEREZ, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWARK, N.J. (AP) -- An attorney for a 14-year-old Monmouth
County boy who claims he was a victim of hazing during a four-day
football camp last summer at a New York college has filed a $15
million lawsuit against the college and two school districts.
</P>
<P>
   The suit, filed Thursday in U.S. District Court in Newark,
claims Wagner College failed to provide proper security and
supervision where the Middletown Township boy, identified by
initials B.D., was allegedly beaten and forced to perform
humiliating acts related to hazing.
</P>
<P>
   Also named in the suit was the Middletown Board of Education and
the West Babylon Board of Education in New York. Students in those
districts were the alleged perpetrators of those acts of hazing,
said Raymond Gill, an attorney for the boy.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of the alleged incident, Assemblyman Steve
Corodemus, R-Monmouth, said he plans to introduce legislation that
could make New Jersey colleges and schools criminally responsible
for hazing if they knowingly allow it on their campuses. Corodemus
said he will introduce the bill next Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ''You hear about this on a college level, but the fact that this
is happening with 13- and 14-year-olds being sent to hockey or
football camp makes the hair on parents' necks stand up,''
Corodemus said.
</P>
<P>
   Neither the boy nor his family were present at a press
conference held by Gill and Corodemus in Red Bank Wednesday to
discuss the lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   Gill said the boy, who was about to enter 9th grade, had
suffered psychologically and physically from acts of hazing during
Seahawk Football Camp at Wagner College on Staten Island last July.
</P>
<P>
   About 100 students -- 50 from each school district -- participated
in last summer's football camp, ranging in age from 13 to 18.
</P>
<P>
   Although students played football together on the field, they
were separated in their dormitory by floors according to age, Gill
said. His client stayed in the Harbor View dormitory.
</P>
<P>
   ''At night, these dorms were turned into torture chambers,''
said Gill. ''The only place these kids were safe was on the
football field.''
</P>
<P>
   Gill said the older students continually harassed the younger
students at the camp.
</P>
<P>
   Gill said upperclassmen had punched his client, dragged him by
the neck and forced him to read erotic material.
</P>
<P>
   In one instance, upper classmen had soaped the hall of a dorm,
tied up the younger students and heaved them down the hall like
human bowling balls, Gill said.
</P>
<P>
   ''They made him and the others stand naked in the hallway with
their hands up while students used them as human goalposts while
they kicked footballs at them,'' Gill said.
</P>
<P>
   Coaches at the camp were not present during the alleged
incidents, Gill said.
</P>
<P>
   The boy could not call his parents because phones in the rooms
were removed after classes at the college had ended, Gill said.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of the alleged incidents, the boy was forced to
change schools.
</P>
<P>
   Mel Noble, superintendent of schools for the West Babylon, N.Y.
district, said he was unaware of the lawsuit or the alleged
incidents involving students in his district.
</P>
<P>
   ''Since no papers have been served on this, we have no
comment,'' Noble said.
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey law currently allows criminal charges only if bodily
injury occurs to a person as a result of hazing, Corodemus said.
</P>
<P>
   ''My bill will not only address these individuals, but will rope
in the organization or institution that violates this as a matter
of tradition,'' said Corodemus. ''That university should be held
responsible that they knowingly let this pass as tradition from
generation to generation.''
</P>
<P>
   Corodemus said he, too, was a victim of hazing when he attended
college.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was required to wear a ridiculous costume on campus and
required to carry other people's books when I pledged to a
fraternity, but I wasn't used as bowling ball down a greased
hallway,'' Corodemus said. ''Kids used as human goalposts, being
chased around campus, or being paddled, or had their hair shaven
represents deviant behavior.''
</P>
<P>
   Calls made by The Associated Press to Walter Hameline, Wagner
College's athletic director and football coach, and the Middletown
Board of Education were not returned Friday.

<HEADLINE> Irish Catholics Face a Meaty Issue  </HEADLINE>
By TOM KIRCHOFER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON (AP) -- Some Irish Catholics may have a beef with the
church on St. Patrick's Day.
</P>
<P>
   This year, the March 17 holiday falls on a Friday in Lent, the
period when Roman Catholics are encouraged to abstain from eating
meat as an act of penance and a reminder of the sacrifices of Jesus
Christ.
</P>
<P>
   Many Catholic bishops, including Boston's and New York's, are
giving dispensation to parishioners who want to partake of the
traditional Irish-American meal of corned beef and cabbage.
</P>
<P>
   But some bishops are refusing to let their congregations off the
hook. In Fall River, Mass., for example, Bishop Sean O'Malley has
not issued a dispensation. As a result, Catholics with a hankering
for corned beef on March 17 may be heading for nearby Boston.
</P>
<P>
   An easing of the rules is not uncommon, particularly in dioceses
where the Irish have a prominent role, said David Early, a
spokesman for the National Conference of Catholic Bishops.
</P>
<P>
   But even without a dispensation, there is an out for Irish
Catholics who don't want to ignore the rules but feel a craving for
corned beef: They can travel to another diocese where the meal is
deemed OK.
</P>
<P>
   ''The application of a dispensation applies to the geographical
region you happen to be in, not to you as a person,'' Early said.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Burke, owner of Doyle's Cafe, an Irish pub in Boston's
Jamaica Plain neighborhood, expects to sell thousands of pounds of
corned beef and cabbage next Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ''Corned beef and cabbage is a mainstay of our menu,'' Burke
said. ''And people are going to do it anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   New York's Cardinal John O'Connor -- whom O'Malley is rumored to
be a candidate to succeed -- has granted the dispensation. But
Bishop James T. McHugh of the nearby Diocese of Rockville Centre,
N.Y., and Bishop Thomas Dailey of Brooklyn, N.Y., will not.
</P>
<P>
   In Maine, Bishop Joseph Gerry has decided to grant dispensations
on an individual basis.
</P>
<P>
   ''If a pastor calls and asks for a dispensation -- an Irish
parish, for example -- he'll grant it, rather than do a universal
dispensation,'' spokesman Marc Mutty said.
</P>
<P>
   The story is similar in Richmond, Va. Bishop Walter F. Sullivan
did not issue any special dispensation before he left on a trip to
India, said diocesan Chancellor Anne Edwards, but individual
requests are being considered.
</P>
<P>
   Corned-beef-eating Irish Catholics in Manchester, N.H., Seattle,
and Madison, Wis., have received the go-ahead.
</P>
<P>
   Philadelphia Cardinal Anthony Bevilacqua granted his flock a
dispensation but said those who take advantage of it should try to
make some other act of penance or sacrifice.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Thomas Reilly, pastor of Immaculate Conception church
in Holyoke -- where Springfield Bishop Thomas Dupre has granted a
dispensation -- said he plans to eat corned beef and cabbage for St.
Patrick's Day. He said Catholics in his diocese would be upset if
they didn't receive the customary permission.
</P>
<P>
   ''I would tend to think there would be an uproar,'' he said.
''People come to expect it.''

<HEADLINE> Study Eyes Patients on Ventilators  </HEADLINE>
By JEFF DONN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   Many deaths of patients on ventilators could be avoided simply
by giving them air in smaller breaths, researchers say in a study
that was released early so doctors could use the life-saving
technique immediately.
</P>
<P>
   ''By providing gentler breaths, we've given acutely inflamed and
injured lungs a better chance of healing,'' said Dr. Roy Brower of
Johns Hopkins University, who headed the study.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers suggested their technique could save 3,000 lives a
year, perhaps many more.
</P>
<P>
   The New England Journal of Medicine released the findings on
Friday in advance of the May 4 publication date.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a real breakthrough in treatment of a devastating
condition,'' said Dr. Michael Matthay at the University of
California at San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   About 100,000 Americans suffer each year from the two conditions
studied: acute lung injury and acute respiratory distress syndrome.
The patients suffer from fluid and inflammation in their lungs --
caused either by injury or infections like pneumonia -- and cannot
breathe properly. About 40 percent die.
</P>
<P>
   In tests on 861 patients at 10 university medical centers,
researchers found 40 percent died with the customary breaths, known
as tidal volume. Only 31 percent died with breaths half the size --
a 22 percent improvement.
</P>
<P>
   The larger volumes were long thought necessary to push air into
weak lungs. But doctors have increasingly worried about stretching
and other damage caused by the big breaths. Some doctors have
already begun using the smaller breaths.
</P>
<P>
   Some patients suffer from complications, like cranial bleeding
and sickle cell disease, that rule out the smaller air volume.
Smaller breaths also tend to make patients short of breath and
uncomfortable.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not as natural, and patients don't tolerate it as well,
so they have to be more heavily sedated,'' said Dr. Kenneth Davis,
a surgeon at the University of Cincinnati. He said he believes
lower air volumes will eventually be used with the vast majority of
patients.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's better to be short of breath and stressed and survive
than the alternative,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Gas tax cut would save Connecticut drivers as much as $140 a year  </HEADLINE>
By ADAM GORLICK, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) -- Supporters of Gov. John G. Rowland's
7-cent gasoline tax cut say it would give drivers relief at the
pumps, but some lawmakers say it might mean a reduction in certain
state services.
</P>
<P>
   The governor's plan to cut one of the country's highest gas
taxes would cost an estimated $99 million in revenue. Rowland wants
the reduction to begin April 1.
</P>
<P>
   Budget director Marc Ryan told the Legislature's Finance
Committee on Friday that the cut could be covered with money from
the state's special transportation fund and the Department of Motor
Vehicles sales taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Ryan said the cut would mean a savings of $85 to $140 a year for
a family that drives 30,000 miles.
</P>
<P>
   Some lawmakers cautioned that the savings will come at a price.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you cut revenue going into transportation, it means you
have to take money from somewhere else,'' said Sen. Alvin Penn,
D-Bridgeport. ''It's like a shell game. If we cut the tax, the
state's road programs will suffer.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Jacqueline Cocco, D-Bridgeport, said she doesn't want
public transportation initiatives carved out of the budget to pay
for the cut.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are trying to reduce the traffic on our highways,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Cocco said southwestern Connecticut is dealing with a 2 percent
increase in automobile traffic each year, a rate she said could be
reversed if the state invested money in public transportation
initiatives such as high-speed ferries.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our subsidy for mass transit should be increased,'' Cocco
said.
</P>
<P>
   Ryan said money from the state's general fund will be used to
pay for any shortfalls in the special transportation fund.
</P>
<P>
   Ryan said reducing Connecticut's gas tax from 32 to 25 cents
will keep Connecticut drivers from crossing state lines to fill up
their tanks.
</P>
<P>
   ''A reduction of 7 cents would mean our tax would be below Rhode
Island's and within 4 cents of Massachusetts,'' Ryan said.
</P>
<P>
   Along with buying gas, people crossing the border are purchasing
groceries and other items, depriving Connecticut of sales tax
dollars, Ryan said.
</P>
<P>
   Linda Olbrys, vice president of the American Automobile
Association of Greater Hartford, said Connecticut's high tax is bad
for business.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've heard from trucking and courier company executives who
fear they might lose employees due to high fuel prices,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Fox, executive director of the Gasoline &AMP; Automotive
Service Dealers of America, said the tax cut could drive pump
prices lower than just a 7-cent reduction.
</P>
<P>
   ''If the price is cut from $1.58 to $1.51, certain guys are
going to go to $1.51 and certain guys are going to go $1.49,'' Fox
said. ''That's how the market will work. Nobody is going to go
$1.50. You just don't see prices like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Ryan also urged the Finance Committee to pass a bill which he
said will save the state's hospitals $75 million a year. The bill
would eliminate the 4.5 percent hospital gross earning tax as of
April 1.
</P>
<P>
   Ryan said the cut will give relief to the hospitals which are
losing money because of limits on Medicare reimbursement and the
rising cost of drugs, and certain medical procedures.
</P>
<P>
   ''Hospitals are facing downsizing and layoffs, even closure,''
Ryan said. ''The effective date of April 1 will help provide
immediate relief to hospitals in Connecticut.''

<HEADLINE> Tobacco Co.'s Hotline Questioned  </HEADLINE>
By SKIP WOLLENBERG, AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Callers to a consumer hotline for Lucky Strike
Filters cigarettes find themselves serenaded by a folksy chorus
urging teens not to smoke.
</P>
<P>
   Then they're invited to press a button for directions to the
nearest tobacco shop.
</P>
<P>
   Brown &AMP; Williamson Tobacco Corp. says the song is intended to
put a smile on its customers' faces, but tobacco foes aren't
laughing.
</P>
<P>
   ''It tells you how insensitive they are,'' said John Garrison,
chief executive of the American Lung Association.
</P>
<P>
   Garrison said the message ''trivializes a very serious problem --
there is no joke here with kids starting to smoke.'' It may even
encourage young people to start smoking by appealing to their
rebellious inclinations, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The message has been on the hotline for about three weeks,
according to company spokesman Mark Smith, and is the latest in a
series of offbeat greetings that the nation's third biggest tobacco
concern has left for callers over the past two years.
</P>
<P>
   Last September, those dialing the number heard a male voice say
the company loves them and that its rivals ''hate you and think
you're ugly.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith said the idea for the unusual messages came from workers
who answer consumer calls.
</P>
<P>
   ''This message is an attempt to just have some fun and show we
don't take ourselves too seriously,'' Smith said. The recordings
purposely fail to mention a brand name and are not intended as a
commercial, Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   In the latest message, a woman's voice greets the caller and
introduces the chorus which sings a jaunty tune about the tobacco
plant.
</P>
<P>
   ''Oh, the tobacco plant is a lovely plant, its leaves so broad
and green. But you shouldn't think about the tobacco plant if
you're still a teen,'' it goes.
</P>
<P>
   '''Cause tobacco is a big person's plant, and that's the way it
should be. So if you're under 21, go and climb a tree.''
</P>
<P>
   When the song ends, the woman's voice asks ''If you think that
really sucked, we agree. Write a better song about the tobacco
plant and we'll use it.''
</P>
<P>
   Callers are then told to ''Press 1 to find select stores in your
area'' or 2 for any other information.
</P>
<P>
   Smith said it is ''a huge stretch to say that we are in any way
encouraging kids to smoke with this. Have you ever heard them
listen to that kind of music by an old-fashioned kind of folk
group?''
</P>
<P>
   He said if callers want information on how to get a specific
product, they are asked first for their birth date and those who
hesitate are cut off.

McHugh of the nearby Diocese of Rockville Centre, N.Y., and Bishop
Thomas Dailey of Brooklyn, N.Y., will not be granting such
permission.
</P>
<P>
   There is an out for Irish-Catholics who don't want to ignore the
rules but feel a craving for corned beef.
</P>
<P>
   They can travel to another diocese where the meal is deemed O.K.
</P>
<P>
   ''The application of a dispensation applies to the geographical
region you happen to be in, not to you as a person,'' Early said.
</P>
<P>
   In Maine, Bishop Joseph Gerry has decided to grant dispensations
on an individual basis.
</P>
<P>
   ''If a pastor calls and asks for a dispensation -- an Irish
parish, for example -- he'll grant it, rather than do a universal
dispensation,'' spokesman Marc Mutty said.
</P>
<P>
   In Richmond, Va., Bishop Walter F. Sullivan did not issue any
special dispensation before he left on a trip to India, said
diocesan Chancellor Anne Edwards. But individual requests for
dispensations are being considered, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Corned-beef-eating Irish-Catholics in Manchester, N.H., Seattle,
and Madison, Wis., have received the go-ahead.
</P>
<P>
   Catholics abstain from eating meat on Fridays in Lent as an act
of penance and a reminder of the sacrifices of Jesus Christ.
</P>
<P>
   Philadelphia Archbishop Anthony Cardinal Bevilacqua granted his
flock a dispensation, but said those who take advantage of it
should try to make some other act of penance or sacrifice.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Thomas Reilly, pastor of Immaculate Conception church
in Holyoke -- where Springfield Bishop Thomas Dupre has granted a
dispensation -- said he plans to eat corned beef and cabbage for St.
Patrick's Day. He said Catholics in his diocese would be upset if
they didn't receive the customary permission.
</P>
<P>
   ''I would tend to think there would be an uproar,'' he said.
''People come to expect it.''

<HEADLINE> NATO Commander Urges Boundaries  </HEADLINE>
By DANICA KIRKA, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   GNJILANE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- NATO's top commander in Kosovo has
bluntly rejected any possibility of coming to the rescue of ethnic
Albanians under pressure from Serb forces along the province's
border in southern Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking at a U.S. military base in Kosovo on Friday, NATO Gen.
Klaus Reinhardt insisted that the alliance will not venture across
the border.
</P>
<P>
   Reinhardt appeared together with Hashim Thaci, Kosovo's top
ethnic Albanian political leader. The two made a strong statement
that they will maintain a hands-off policy in the Presevo Valley,
which falls just outside Kosovo's administrative boundaries.
</P>
<P>
   Reinhardt said the mission of his forces was clear -- enforcing a
U.N. Security Council Resolution ''within the boundaries of Kosovo.
I repeat, within the boundaries of Kosovo.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Kosovo and the region right across the border are
technically part of Serbia, the larger member of the Yugoslav
federation led by Slobodan Milosevic. But Kosovo -- which has a
heavily ethnic Albanian population -- has been under international
control since last year's conflict between ethnic Albanians and
Milosevic's Serb forces led to NATO bombing of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Now, some in the area fear that the border region could be the
scene of renewed fighting similar to the Kosovo conflict.
</P>
<P>
   The area across the border has been the site of sporadic clashes
between ethnic Albanian guerrillas and Serb police. Hundreds of
refugees have been fleeing from predominantly ethnic Albanian towns
in southern Serbia over the past two months. They have streamed
into the closest Kosovo town of Gnjilane, about 30 miles southeast
of Kosovo's provincial capital, Pristina.
</P>
<P>
   A newly formed rebel group has emerged in the border region. The
group's fighters say they are trying to protect villagers there
from attacks by Serb forces.
</P>
<P>
   They are widely believed to have received support from within
Kosovo. But NATO has been stepping up activities to seal Kosovo's
border to prevent the export of both weapons and other support for
the guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
   Foot patrols, checkpoints and other surveillance operations are
being put in place, ''in order to detect any cross-border
movement,'' Reinhardt said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are also prepared to take all necessary action to ensure
that Kosovo is not used as a staging base for exporting violence
into the Presevo Valley, or indeed attempting to extend violence
back into Kosovo,'' he said. ''Any insurgent activity based in
Kosovo, and the conduct of cross-border operations, cannot and will
not be condoned or tolerated.''
</P>
<P>
   Thaci's presence at the press conference was apparently meant to
demonstrate a united front against aiding ethnic Albanian militants
in the border area. But Thaci charged that Milosevic's government
is manipulating the situation to destabilize Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   He insisted that Kosovo Albanians ''are not going to fall into
Belgrade's trap.'' Thaci did not condemn the actions of the
guerrillas, but he said the situation ''may put at risk everything
that has been achieved so far in Kosovo. This won't happen.''

   LONDON (AP) -- British Airways began searching for a new chief

resignation after four troubled years as head of Britain's largest
airline. British Airways chairman Lord Colin Marshall will take

<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- In the latest sign of investors' frenzy for
technology, the Nasdaq composite index vaulted past 5,000 Thursday,
slightly more than two months after it first topped 4,000. The
technology-dominated index edged higher Friday. The Nasdaq's
stunning gains this year, and its seemingly unstoppable velocity,
have confirmed the index as the top-performing and fastest-growing
barometer of the U.S. stock market. The index is now up 24 percent
for the year, compared with a more than 13 percent loss for its
blue-chip counterpart, the Dow Jones industrial average.

regional Bell company U S West Inc. Qwest will have to divest
itself of its customers in the U S West territory of 14 Western
states. The Federal Communications Commission said Qwest must give
up about 6 percent of its long-distance customers, all of whom live
in areas served by U S West. Qwest's shares were down 11.88

   World's Oil Reserves Dwindle

<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- The world's richest countries have depleted their
oil inventories to the lowest levels seen in four years, a widely
read survey said today, reinforcing concerns that motorists will
soon be paying even stiffer prices to fill their tanks. Pinched
profit margins for oil refineries have caused a slowdown in the
production of gasoline and other products, and this delay could
lead to gas shortages during the peak driving season this summer,
the International Energy Agency reported.

   World Bank Likely To OK Iran Loans

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Two loans to Iran, the first in seven years,
are likely to be approved soon by the World Bank over U.S.
opposition. Bank and Iranian officials plan a final round of
negotiations in Paris before the end of the month on the $231
million package. If the talks succeed, the two projects will go
before the bank's executive directors. Federal law requires the
United States to oppose loans by the World Bank to countries listed
by the State Department as sponsors of terrorism. Iran is among
seven countries on the list.

   Continental Raises Fares $40
</P>
<P>
   HOUSTON (AP) -- Continental Airlines attempted today to impose a
new fare increase of up to $40 per round trip, blaming the rising
cost of fuel. The airline led the industry in a $20 boost in
January, but had to back off on second increase of $30 two weeks
ago after other airlines wouldn't follow. Generally when airlines
raise fares, the hikes will remain in place if their competitors
also raise fares. Otherwise, the fare hikes are repealed, as
happened in February.

<TEXT>
<P>
   KIRKLAND, Wash. (AP) -- HomeGrocer.com Inc.'s stock rose nearly
18 percent on Friday when it debuted on Wall Street, despite some
concern from investors about the viability of the entire online
grocery business.
</P>
<P>
   The stock, priced at $12 per share, finished the day at $14.12{
on the Nasdaq Stock Market. It traded as high as $16.25.
</P>
<P>
   HomeGrocer.com offered 22 million shares, giving the company
$264 million. Trading volume for the day was 20,864,900 shares.
</P>
<P>
   HomeGrocer.com takes online orders and delivers groceries to
homes in Seattle, Portland, Ore., and southern California. Its
backers include Amazon.com and venture capital firms Hummer Winblad
Venture Partners and Perkins Caufield &AMP; Byers. Former Netscape
Communications Corp. Chief Executive Jim Barksdale is also an
investor and board member.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street has grown leery of online grocery sites in recent
months, noting that Web grocers face huge costs as they expand to
cities around the nation and advertise aggressively to woo
shoppers. They also must fend off new competition from traditional
chains that are moving online.
</P>
<P>
   Stocks in the sector, including Webvan Group Inc., Peapod Inc.
and Streamline.com Inc., have fallen in recent months due to
investors' concerns.

<HEADLINE> FAA Targets Air Traffic Delays  </HEADLINE>
By SONYA ROSS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton on Friday announced a plan
to curb flight delays at the nation's airports during the
thunderstorm-laden spring and summer months by having the Federal
Aviation Administration share high-tech weather forecasts and help
redirect traffic.
</P>
<P>
   The goal is to avoid a repeat of last year, when more than 1,200
planes were delayed every day due to some of the worst summer
storms on record. Runways were clogged and often flights were
canceled with little or no explanation to passengers.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not good for travelers, it's not good for the airline
industry, and it's not good for the overall economy,'' Clinton
said. ''As we work to keep the travel as safe as it can be, we
should also do everything we can to make it as efficient as it can
be.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the program announced Friday, the FAA will post a Web site
with information about the weather's impact on travel schedules. It
will debut on April 3. The FAA will also hold teleconferences with
airlines to address weather conditions two to six hours away.
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, traffic planners at the FAA's air traffic control
system command center in Herndon, Va., will be allowed to make
decisions to keep traffic moving.
</P>
<P>
   To help speed traffic in poor weather, the Pentagon will work
with the FAA to allow use of military airspace off the East Coast.
The FAA and the airlines also have developed a list of alternate
routes to take aircraft around storms and have agreed to make
better use of lower-level airspace to deal with traffic at peak
times.
</P>
<P>
   ''Until we work out a way to get Mother Nature to cooperate,
storms, delays and cancellations will always be with us,'' Clinton
said. ''If we can photograph and analyze weather patterns from
space, we ought to be able to tell passengers why they are delayed
and for how long.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a strategy that takes on new urgency in light of a forecast
issued earlier this week that by 2010, commercial airplanes flying
in U.S. airspace will carry more than 1 billion passengers a year,
up from 650 million last year.
</P>
<P>
   Airlines greeted the plan optimistically.
</P>
<P>
   ''I believe that this will lead to much improved customer
service this summer, and at the same time make us the safest
airline industry in the world,'' said John Dasburg, president and
CEO of Northwest Airlines.
</P>
<P>
   In a private session with Clinton, airline executives also
shared their concerns about rising fuel prices, said Transportation
Secretary Rodney Slater. ''I know that is something that was
important to them, and it's something the president is working
on,'' Slater said.
</P>
<P>
   Donald Carty, president and CEO of American Airlines, said it is
hard to say whether fuel prices will have an impact on fares this
summer. But he pointed out that every 1-cent increase costs the
airlines $200 million.
</P>
<P>
   ''That means 40 cents is literally eight billion dollars. We
didn't make $8 billion last year,'' Carty said. ''There's economic
strain in our system. We're terribly concerned about it.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the FAA, there were 197,531 air traffic control
delays between April and August 1999 -- 36 percent more than the
same five-month period in the previous year. In July 1999 alone,
delays were up 76 percent over the year before.
</P>
<P>
   FAA Administrator Jane Garvey said representatives from
airlines, labor unions, controllers and regulators have held weekly
meetings since last fall to find a way to deal with weather
problems that were exacerbated last year by computer problems at a
few of the FAA's 20 control centers.
</P>
<P>
   ''We recognized quite straightforwardly that there was more we
needed to do,'' Garvey said. ''It is our opportunity to really take
a look at the system as a whole. That's what is so important.''

<HEADLINE> Russia Claims Rout of Rebels  </HEADLINE>
By RUSLAN MUSAYEV, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   KOMSOMOLSKOYE, Russia (AP) -- A Russian commander claimed Friday
that a major group of Chechen rebels was routed in fierce fighting
in the republic's mountains, while Russian jets intensely bombed
the village of Komsomolskoye to try to drive out rebels.
</P>
<P>
   Lt. Gen. Gennady Troshev, a top commander for Chechnya, said a
group of about 2,500 rebels was defeated after battles around the
village of Ulus-Kert, where fighting had raged for about two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   He said the rebels were under the leadership of two of
Chechnya's most notorious warlords, Shamil Basayev and Khattab, who
uses only one name.
</P>
<P>
   ''Bands of small number still remain, but the so-called armed
forces (of rebels) do not exist any more,'' he said, according to
the news agency ITAR-Tass. Small rebel groups, however, have been
able to mount costly hit-and-run attacks on Russian forces.
</P>
<P>
   Rebels who seized Komsomolskoye on Sunday have reportedly broken
into small formations under a relentless Russian assault that has
left the village in ruins. The rebels' seizure of the village
embarrassed Russian forces who claimed to have the insurgents
blocked.
</P>
<P>
   But despite repeated statements that Komsomolskoye was about to
fall, the small rebel groups have stalled the Russians with fierce
resistance.
</P>
<P>
   Under a sunny spring sky, tanks and howitzers in nearby fields
fired salvo after salvo into Komsomolskoye, in the foothills of the
Caucasus Mountains, to prevent rebels from breaking out.
</P>
<P>
   Russian commanders said the rebels were concentrated in a
southern part of Komsomolskoye. But soldiers who were searching
house-to-house for militants Friday said rebel resistance was still
intense. They said at least 11 Russian troops had been killed in
this week's fighting.
</P>
<P>
   The battle for Komsomolskoye, which began when Chechens seized
the village Sunday, underlines Russia's inability to rout
Chechnya's militants after six months of war, even though Russian
troops outnumber them and have superior weapons.
</P>
<P>
   After keeping some 1,000 residents of Komsomolskoye herded in a
field on the outskirts of the village during three days of
round-the-clock shelling, the military on Friday permitted the
civilians to go north to the town of Urus-Martan.
</P>
<P>
   Residents in Komsomolskoye claim Russian troops looted some
homes and then torched them.
</P>
<P>
   Russian forces control most of Chechnya, and have focused their
offensive in the southern mountains since thousands of rebels
abandoned Grozny last month.
</P>
<P>
   Commanders want to block rebels from carrying out attacks in
Russian-held flatland areas. Such attacks have already caused heavy
Russian losses, including an ambush in Grozny that killed 20
Russian troops last week.
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 200-300 rebels are still in Grozny, even after more
than a month of Russian occupation, according to Valery Manilov,
deputy head of the armed forces General Staff.
</P>
<P>
   Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev and other commanders said Friday
that a rebel ambush in Ulus-Kert last week killed at least 85
paratroopers. Russian officials initially denied such a raid had
occurred.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, 1,556 Russian troops have been killed since the ground
operation in Chechnya began, Manilov said Friday. Soldiers, rights
groups and rebels say the real death toll is higher.
</P>
<P>
   Russia began its ground campaign in Chechnya in September to
fight Islamic rebels who attacked the neighboring republic of
Dagestan in August.
</P>
<P>
   In Moscow, a delegation from the parliamentary assembly of the
Council of Europe prepared to travel to Chechnya on Saturday to
investigate complaints of human rights violations in Russia's
military campaign.

<HEADLINE> Boeing Offers To Pay for Lost Tanks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   HUNTSVILLE, Ala. (AP) -- Boeing has offered to reimburse the
federal government for two International Space Station tanks,
valued at $750,000, that apparently were discarded by mistake at
the Marshall Space Flight Center.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Mills, deputy program manager for Boeing's space station
work, said Friday the company has offered to pay NASA for the
equipment even if Boeing was not responsible for losing it.
</P>
<P>
   Mills' statement marked a reversal from last week when a Boeing
spokesman said the government would have to pay for new tanks if
they are needed in place of spares.
</P>
<P>
   The nitrogen and oxygen tanks used by astronauts apparently had
been moved outside a building, still in their 5-foot-by-5-foot
wooden crates, to make room for another space station part at
Boeing's Huntsville plant last month. Boeing officials said the
crates probably were taken to a trash bin by mistake. Attempts to
find them later were unsuccessful.

<HEADLINE> Search Ends for Dominican Migrants  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) -- Rescuers have called off the search
for victims of a boat accident off Puerto Rico's west coast that
killed at least 10 illegal Dominican migrants and left 33 missing,
an immigration official said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Police and federal agents did not find any more survivors or
victims Thursday and called off their search about nightfall, said
Ivan Ortiz, spokesman for the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization
Service.
</P>
<P>
   Immigration agents have deported 12 of the 27 survivors they had
in custody, and expected to send the rest back by Tuesday, Ortiz
said. Search teams recovered 10 bodies from Wednesday's accident,
but rough seas made their task difficult.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities said some of the 33 missing likely had run off into
the coastal brush and hills to avoid deportation. The boat had been
carrying an estimated 70 Dominicans.

   Survivors said the boat was smashed apart in heavy waves
Wednesday morning just 60 yards from shore near the town of
Isabela, while its crew was trying to rescue a woman who had fallen
overboard. The Dominican Republic is about 75 miles west of the
U.S. Caribbean territory.

Comptroller: State not improving oversight of child protective
agencies
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- State Comptroller H. Carl McCall charged
Friday that his recommendations for improving oversight of social
service districts are not being followed, leaving room for abused,
neglected, and troubled children to fall through the cracks.
</P>
<P>
   In March 1998, a comptroller's audit concluded that caseloads
far exceeded national standards, with some of the 58 local social
service districts reporting caseloads as high as 86 cases per
worker. McCall compared that with the 17-caseload maximum
recommended by the Child Welfare League of America.
</P>
<P>
   Officials with the state's Department of Children and Family
Planning countered that they could not mandate staffing levels on
counties, which would have to pay for the staffing.
</P>
<P>
   Still, McCall said the state could take the lead in monitoring
district staffing and update standards set in 1969. That set the
standard for preventive services between 20 and 60 children per
caseworker and the standard for foster care at a maximum of 50
children per caseworker.
</P>
<P>
   McCall said that although some improvements have been made in
caseworker training, his recommendations to the state to establish
a tracking system and upgrade their own staffing levels were going
unheeded.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Van Slyke, spokesman for the Department of Children and
Family Services, said that many of the recommendations had already
been implemented.
</P>
<P>
   ''And he knows that,'' Van Slyke said of the comptroller.
''Apparently he finds it personally expedient to politicize child
welfare.''
</P>
<P>
   McCall spokeswoman Theresa Bourgeois countered that the issue
was not political.
</P>
<P>
   ''They have only partially implemented five of the 13
recommendations. They have not implemented any having to do with
caseworker caseload. The issue here has to do with the safety of
children at risk, and nothing else,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Dial Expects Earnings To Sink  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SCOTTSDALE, Ariz. (AP) -- Soap maker Dial Corp. said Friday its
earnings per share will be down by at least 10 percent in the first
half compared with a year ago. Its stock price plunged more than 24
percent by midday.
</P>
<P>
   Dial's announcement followed a similar earnings warning from
consumer products industry leader Procter &AMP; Gamble Co. that caused
that that company's stock to plunge by about 31 percent on Tuesday
and raised worries about the entire group.
</P>
<P>
   Dial, whose brands include Dial soap, Purex laundry detergents,
Renuzit air fresheners and Armour Star canned meats, said inventory
adjustments as its second-largest customer converted from buying
direct to buying through wholesalers had hurt sales.
</P>
<P>
   Sales were also hurt by a detergent price war by two rivals in
Argentina and a drop in the sale of Armour canned meats due to
higher prices and Y2K hoarding.
</P>
<P>
   Rising petroleum costs have also hurt by boosting transportation
and distribution expenses, Dial said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're extremely disappointed to announce that our first half
results are being adversely affected by these events,'' said Mal
Jozoff, Dial's chairman and chief executive. ''Any of them taken
alone would not likely have materially impacted our year.''
</P>
<P>
   Dial shares fell $3.25, or 22.8 percent, to $11 in trading at
4:30 p.m. on the New York Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Dial said it expects earnings per share for the first half to be
10 percent to 12 percent lower than a year ago. While it left its
earnings estimates for the second half of the year unchanged, the
company now expects earnings for the year will grow by between 5
percent and 7 percent, slower than it had previously expected.
</P>
<P>
   In advance of the announcement, analysts surveyed by First
Call/Thomson Financial had expected Dial to earn $1.33 for the
year, up 13.7 percent from $1.17 a share last year.

<HEADLINE> Washington Post Co. Head Steps Down  </HEADLINE>
By DERRILL HOLLY, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Alan G. Spoon said Friday he would step down
as president and CEO of the Washington Post Co. to join Polaris
Venture Partners, a Boston-based venture capital firm.
</P>
<P>
   ''After two decades of corporate management, I look forward to a
change of focus,'' said Spoon, who joined the Post in 1982. Spoon
said that in his new position as general partner, he would be
devoting himself to ''identifying and developing new businesses.''
</P>
<P>
   After serving as chief financial officer, Spoon was appointed
president of Newsweek Magazine in 1989. He became president of the
parent company in September 1993 when Donald E. Graham assumed the
CEO position formerly held by his mother, Katharine Graham, who is
now chairwoman of the company's executive committee.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the Graham family say Spoon was instrumental in
building the family's holdings into a company that had sales in
excess of $2.2 billion last year. The company has not yet named a
replacement.
</P>
<P>
   ''He got us early into lots of things that have panned out big
time,'' said Donald E. Graham, chairman and chief executive officer
of the Washington Post, adding that Spoon also helped pick the
talent that will lead the company's nearly 9,000 employees for
years to come.
</P>
<P>
   A graduate of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Spoon
encouraged the Grahams to invest Washington Post resources into
cellular telephone technology in the early 1980's.
</P>
<P>
   Spoon also helped develop the Post's Internet presence into
''one of the most aggressive in the nation,'' Graham said.

<HEADLINE> Memo Accuses Justice on Clinton  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The ex-chief of the Justice Department's
campaign fund-raising task force accused his superiors in a memo of
legal ''contortions'' to avoid an independent inquiry, a published
report revealed Friday. Republicans predictably renewed allegations
of a coverup.
</P>
<P>
   GOP presidential candidate George W. Bush, New York Mayor
Rudolph Giuliani and Republican lawmakers said the memo indicates
an effort to protect the president, vice president, first lady and
other senior White House officials.
</P>
<P>
   ''We knew Justice was doing everything they could'' to prevent
an independent counsel investigation, but ''we did not know until
now the extent to which they went to keep a lid on it,'' said Sen.
Fred Thompson, R-Tenn., whose Governmental Affairs Committee
investigated campaign fund raising.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Dan Burton, R-Ind., chairman of the House Government Reform
Committee, subpoenaed the 1998 memo by Charles LaBella. The memo's
conclusion that an independent counsel was needed has long been
known, but not the strong words used to make the point. The Los
Angeles Times published quotes from the memo in Friday's editions.
</P>
<P>
   FBI Director Louis Freeh, in a 1997 memo, also said he favored
an independent investigation, advice that Attorney General Janet
Reno repeatedly rejected.
</P>
<P>
   The Times quoted the memo as saying Justice officials used
''gamesmanship'' and legal ''contortions'' to avoid an independent
inquiry into Clinton-Gore fund-raising matters.
</P>
<P>
   The report said the independent probe needed to look at ''the
entire landscape'' of campaign finance allegations, ''conjured up
by sophisticated political operatives to circumvent'' election
finance laws during the 1996 Clinton re-election campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The Times said the memo accused top Justice Department officials
of using ''intellectually dishonest'' double standards by endorsing
independent counsels to investigate Cabinet-level officials -- while
opposing them for President Clinton, Vice President Al Gore, first
lady Hillary Rodham Clinton and former White House aide Harold
Ickes. Ickes is a top adviser to Mrs. Clinton's Senate campaign in
New York.
</P>
<P>
   Presidential press secretary Joe Lockhart commented the Times
story was ''recycled information.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said in a statement, ''The vice president needs to clear up
what role he played in raising money from the White House.'' The
presidential hopeful said the memo raised ''troubling questions''
about whether Gore misled federal investigators when he said he did
not recall crucial fund-raising discussions. The Times account said
former White House aide Leon Panetta recalled Gore ''attentatively
listening.''
</P>
<P>
   Burton said he expected ''immediate compliance'' with his
committee's subpoena for the LaBella memo and Freeh memos.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Lehane, spokesman for Gore's campaign, referred questions
to the vice president's office, which did not immediately return a
request for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Fred Thompson, R-Tenn., said, ''We knew Justice was doing
everything they could'' to prevent an independent counsel
investigation, but ''we did not know until now the extent to which
they went to keep a lid on it.''
</P>
<P>
   The campaign organization for Giuliani, Mrs. Clinton's opponent,
said, ''The LaBella report should be released immediately so the
American people can evaluate the serious charges cited in the
report. Those implicated in the report include Hillary Clinton and
her top adviser, Harold Ickes.''
</P>
<P>
   Chief Justice Department spokesman Myron Marlin said, ''The
attorney general relied on the advice of many Justice Department
officials as she usually does in making decisions. Even
non-political career employees who have worked in different
administrations offered differing views on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   ''In the end, she based her decision on the facts and the law.
Over the years she requested independent counsels no fewer than 7
times and has forwarded at least 10 different matters to those
independent counsels.''

<HEADLINE> USDA Combining State Offices  </HEADLINE>
By PHILIP BRASHER, AP Farm Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Agriculture Department announced plans
Friday to combine its agencies' state offices in 25 states and
Puerto Rico to save about $9 million a year in administrative costs
and make it easier for people to get services.
</P>
<P>
   After the consolidation, state offices of USDA's Farm Service
Agency, Natural Resources Conservation Service and rural
development programs will all be located at a single site in each
state. No jobs are to be cut as a result.
</P>
<P>
   In some states, such as Texas, North Dakota and Wisconsin, the
state offices for the various agencies are located in different
cities. In other places, such as Des Moines, Iowa, the offices are
housed in different buildings in the same city.
</P>
<P>
   Moving the offices together ''will help us provide better, more
efficient, less costly service to our customers,'' Agriculture
Secretary Dan Glickman said.
</P>
<P>
   But the announcement immediately raised concerns in Congress.
Republican and Democratic leaders of the House Agriculture
Committee said they would hold a hearing on the consolidations and
also have them reviewed by the General Accounting Office.
</P>
<P>
   The panel's chairman, Larry Combest, R-Texas, and ranking
Democrat, fellow Texan Charles Stenholm, issued a joint statement
saying they were concerned ''that the process USDA used to select
the statewide headquarters did not result in the best use of
taxpayer dollars.''
</P>
<P>
   In Texas, USDA's state offices are now located in Temple and
College Station, neither of which is in Combest's or Stenholm's
districts. Under USDA's plan, the offices would be consolidated in
Temple two years from now.
</P>
<P>
   Congress required USDA six years ago to start streamlining its
field operations. But farm-state lawmakers have criticized job
reductions in county offices as excessive.
</P>
<P>
   The consolidations of state offices are to start this year in
Palmer, Alaska; Phoenix; Storrs, Conn.; Des Moines; Champaign,
Ill.; Jackson, Miss.; Durham, N.H.; Lincoln, Neb.; Portland, Ore.;
Hato Rey, Puerto Rico; Nashville, Tenn.; Burlington, Vt.; and
Casper, Wyo.
</P>
<P>
   During the 2001 budget year, which starts Oct. 1, state offices
will be consolidated in Bismarck, N.D.; Trenton, N.J.; Reno, Nev.;
Spokane, Wash.; and Madison, Wis.
</P>
<P>
   Offices will be consolidated in fiscal 2002 in Montgomery, Ala.;
Dover, Del.; Honolulu; Manhattan, Kan.; Annapolis, Md.; Bozeman,
Mont.; and Columbia, S.C., and Temple.
</P>
<P>
   Offices already are combined in the remaining states.

<HEADLINE> Lebanon Hopeful About Arab Meeting  </HEADLINE>
By HUSSEIN DAKROUB, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) -- As fighting raged Friday in southern
Lebanon, the government looked toward an upcoming gathering of Arab
foreign ministers that it hopes will produce financial and
political support in its confrontation with Israel.
</P>
<P>
   With ministers converging on Beirut for Saturday's conference,
Israeli warplanes on Friday attacked a valley in southwest Lebanon
-- about 20 minutes after guerrillas fired some 15 mortars and
rockets at the Beaufort castle Israeli outpost, Lebanese security
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, Israeli jets attacked suspected guerrilla targets in
two other spots in the south. There were no immediate reports of
casualties.
</P>
<P>
   In a show of solidarity with Lebanon, the 22-member Arab League
shifted its bimonthly foreign ministers' meeting to Beirut from its
headquarters in Cairo.
</P>
<P>
   League Secretary-General Esmat Abdel-Meguid told reporters
Friday that the weekend conference will be a ''historic and
important meeting that will again express solidarity and support
for Lebanon.''
</P>
<P>
   Syrian Foreign Minister Farouk al-Sharaa, who met with Lebanese
Prime Minister Salim Hoss, told reporters that the meeting will
issue ''an important message from the Arabs to Israel that its
attacks on Lebanon must stop.''
</P>
<P>
   A wave of sympathy and support for Lebanon unprecedented in
recent years has swept the Arab world since last month's Israeli
airstrikes on the country's civilian infrastructure and subsequent
threats of more punishing raids if guerrilla attacks on Israeli
troops continue in southern Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   Retaliating for Israeli casualties, Israel's warplanes struck
deep into Lebanon on Feb. 8, knocking out three power stations,
causing widespread electricity outages, and wounding 15 civilians.
Seven Israeli soldiers were killed between Jan. 25 and Feb. 11 by
Iranian-backed Hezbollah guerrillas, who are leading the war to
oust Israeli forces from southern Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to political backing, Lebanon is expected to win
financial aid. Saudi Arabia has already committed $100 million in
loans and $30 million in grants during a visit last week by Crown
Prince Abdullah. Kuwait recently donated $16 million to repair the
damaged power stations.
</P>
<P>
   Israel said formally on Sunday that it will end its 18-year
occupation of southern Lebanon by July.

<HEADLINE> Ringleader of Camden drug organization pleads guilty to conspiracycharges  </HEADLINE>
By MELANIE BURNEY, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAMDEN, N.J. (AP) -- The ringleader of a drug organization that
operated round-the-clock in one of Camden's most blighted
neighborhoods pleaded guilty Friday to drug conspiracy charges.
</P>
<P>
   Jonathan Ringo, 33, of Willingboro, admitted organizing and
controlling the drug ring that operated in South Camden for five
years before it was toppled by authorities.
</P>
<P>
   Ringo also implicated three co-defendants, including his
half-brother who is awaiting trial. Ringo faces at least 10 years
in prison when he is sentenced June 2 by U.S. District Judge
Stephen M. Orlofsky.
</P>
<P>
   ''He will get more than the minimum, most likely,'' said
Assistant U.S. Attorney Howard Wiener.
</P>
<P>
   The guilty plea comes just two weeks after two reputed leaders
of the biggest drug ring in Camden's history were convicted on drug
conspiracy charges. Both cases were prosecuted under a federal
program targeting high intensity drug trafficking areas.
</P>
<P>
   ''This prosecution is another major blow to the drug trade that
has ravaged Camden and terrorized its residents for years,'' said
U.S. Attorney Robert J. Cleary. ''Coming on the heels of the recent
trial victory, the message should be clear to those who operate and
frequent open-air drug markets.''
</P>
<P>
   Ringo admitted that his drug organization operated at least two
open-air markets located at Lester Terrace and another at Third and
Liberty Streets where cocaine and crack were distributed between
1992 and 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The drug markets operated every day of the week, sometimes
around-the clock, Ringo said. The ring reportedly netted $10
million a year selling $10 bags of cocaine.
</P>
<P>
   The drug ring was based primarily in The Terraces section of
South Camden just off Interstate 676. The neighborhood consists of
a cluster of about 150 mostly abandoned and dilapidated rowhouses.
</P>
<P>
   The rowhouses, located in an industrial section of the city,
protected drug dealers from police and rival dealers. Ringo said
the drug ring used several buildings and homes scattered around
Camden to store drugs, cash and weapons.
</P>
<P>
   ''If they tear them down ... I'm finished,'' court papers cited
by the Courier-Post of Cherry Hill quote Ringo telling an associate
before the city began demolishing 30 rowhouses in the neighborhood
in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Ringo, according to the newspaper planned to buy the rundown
neighborhood to protective his lucrative drug trade. Before his
arrest in October 1997, Ringo discussed plans with an accountant to
purchase the 150 rowhouses from the city at a cost of about $500.
</P>
<P>
   Also charged with Ringo were: Wendy Davis, 31, of Camden, who
pleaded guilty and is awaiting sentencing; March Farmer, 32, of
Pennsauken, who will stand trial May 30; and Bruce McDade, 27, of
Camden, who is a fugitive.
</P>
<P>
   Ringo, who has been in custody since his arrest, is being held
in the Salem County Jail. He previously was held in the Camden
County Jail for 17 months and his attorney, Michael Kahn, said he
plans to file a motion seeking a lighter sentence because of
conditions at the Camden facility.
</P>
<P>
   ''The housing conditions, to some extent, are inhumane,'' said
Kahn, noting that Ringo slept on the floor next to the toilet in a
cell he shared with three other inmates.

<HEADLINE> Dow Ends Off 81.91; Nasdaq Up 1.76  </HEADLINE>
By EILEEN GLANTON, AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were mostly lower Friday as the consumer
products sector, already trampled by Procter &AMP; Gamble's
disappointing earnings forecast, slipped further on a similar
warning from Dial Corp. High-tech stocks fell as investors cashed
in some gains from the sector's recent rally.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average fell 81.91 to 9,928.82, capping
a highly volatile week. The Dow fell 438.38 points for the week, a
loss of 4.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq composite index, which fluctuated between gains and
losses throughout the session, finished up 1.76 at 5,048.62,
achieving a new closing high by the slimmest of margins. The Nasdaq
rose 133.83 points during the week, a gain of 2.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were mixed. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500
fell 6.62 to 1,395.07.
</P>
<P>
   Consumer products stocks struggled after Dial said its earnings
for the first half of this year will be down at least 10 percent
from a year ago. Its stock plunged 3\ to 11 on the news.

   Dial was the second consumer products maker to warn of
disappointing earnings this week. On Tuesday, Procter &AMP; Gamble
shook Wall Street when it announced its third-quarter earnings
would miss expectations. That sent the Dow tumbling nearly 375
points.
</P>
<P>
   ''Another consumer products company stubbed its toe and now
buyers are wary of anything in the blue-chip sector,'' said Alan
Ackerman, senior vice president at Fahnestock &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
   Procter &AMP; Gamble fell 3~ to 53~. Its shares have fallen 39
percent since Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Blue chip stocks have been most heavily affected by investors'
fears that the Federal Reserve will continue raising interest rates
this year to combat inflation. In a reversal of old expectations,
investors now feel that the slower growth rates of industrial
companies will leave them most vulnerable to higher interest rates,
which generally cut into corporate profits.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's put all of the old-line cyclical stocks under severe
pressure while the Nasdaq has gone screaming out to new highs,''
said Ricky Harrington, technical analyst at Wachovia Securities in
Charlotte, N.C.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq's sprint to 5,000 this week prompted many investors
to take a step back Friday. The index closed above 5,000 for the
first time on Thursday, breaking through its latest thousand-point
barrier just over two months after closing above 4,000 for the
first time.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said some investors were collecting their gains from
the Nasdaq's dramatic rise.
</P>
<P>
   CMGI fell 8 15/16 to 136 7/16 and Oracle fell 2] to 81|. Among
Dow components, Hewlett-Packard fell 59/64 to 150 61/64.
</P>
<P>
   ''The market started with a bullish tone today. However, traders
were quick to take profits,'' Ackerman said.
</P>
<P>
   Ackerman and other analysts still expect the Nasdaq to remain
the best-performing U.S. stock index in the months to come, thanks
to big money from mutual funds and pension plans pouring into the
technology sector.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, some technology stocks continued to attract buyers. Dell
Computer rose 13/16 to 51\ after PaineWebber raised its rating on
the stock to ''buy.'' Qualcomm rose 9[ to 136[.
</P>
<P>
   Financial shares, which have been punished recently by investors
worried about interest rates, were looking more attractive Friday
as the market realized that these companies are enjoying revenue
increases because of the rising volume of stock trading. American
Express was the biggest gainer among Dow components, rising 3 15/16
to 126 11/16. Charles Schwab rose 6} to 52\.
</P>
<P>
   Goldman Sachs rose 5 1/16 to 112\ on volume that heavy enough to
prompt the New York Stock Exchange to ask the firm to explain the
unusual market activity. Goldman Sachs declined to comment to the
NYSE or to The Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by an 11-to-8 margin on
the New York Stock Exchange, where volume totaled 1.39 billion
shares, compared with 1.37 billion in the previous session.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies fell 2.24 to 603.81.
</P>
<P>
   Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average rose 0.5 percent.
Germany's Xetra DAX index rose 0.3 percent, Britain's FT-SE 100
gained 0.6 percent, and France's CAC-40 rose 1.4 percent.

<HEADLINE> Gore Blasts Bush on Mansion Guests  </HEADLINE>
By JONATHAN D. SALANT, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Sharpening his arguments for campaign finance
reform, Vice President Al Gore went after George W. Bush on two
issues Friday: sleepovers at the governor's mansion and the recent
attack ads that Bush supporters ran against John McCain in
Republican primaries.
</P>
<P>
   Gore spokesman Chris Lehane raised the issues a day after both
Sen. McCain and former Sen. Bill Bradley -- both of whom pledged to
overhaul the way campaigns are funded -- ended their presidential
campaigns. He said Bush ''has a lot of explaining to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the week, Gore challenged Bush to give up soft money,
the unregulated sums raised by the political parties to air issue
advertisements in support of their candidates.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign finance issue cuts both ways; Gore faces his own
questions about fund-raising improprieties during the 1996
campaign. Earlier this month, a federal jury convicted Gore friend
and veteran Democratic fund-raiser Maria Hsia of arranging more
than $100,000 in illegal donations, some of them reimbursed by the
Buddhist temple where the vice president attended a fund-raising
event.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not surprising that Al Gore would be trying to deflect
attention,'' Bush campaign spokeswoman Mindy Tucker said. ''No
matter how hard he tries, people still have a lot of questions as
to what has gone on in the current administration with regard to
fund raising in the White House.''
</P>
<P>
   But Lehane continued the Gore campaign's criticism of Bush over
campaign finance.
</P>
<P>
   He noted that McCain has asked the Federal Election Commission
to investigate the recent $2.5-million ad campaign against the
Arizona senator. The Federal Communications Commission also is
investigating the ads, which were financed by two Texas brothers,
Sam and Charles Wyly. Charles is a ''pioneer,'' the term given by
the Bush campaign to those who have raised more than $100,000 for
the Texas governor's presidential effort.
</P>
<P>
   And Lehane cited a report by The Associated Press earlier this
month. The AP reported that eight of the 31 overnight guests in the
Texas Governor's Mansion last year had helped Bush raise a record
$70 million for his presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   McCain complained during the campaign that the mansion
sleepovers were reminiscent of President Clinton using the Lincoln
Bedroom to reward big Democratic donors.
</P>
<P>
   ''George Bush has a lot of explaining to do: What did he know
and when did he know that the Wyly brothers spent millions of
dollars on attack ads against John McCain? What did he know and
when did he know that pioneers were rewarded with sleepovers at the
governor's mansion?'' Lehane said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has said that he opened the mansion to friends and
relatives, not campaign fund-raisers.
</P>
<P>
   ''These people are relatives and friends who were welcome in my
home before I was governor, they are welcome in our home while I am
governor, and they will always be welcome in our home after I am
governor,'' Bush said in response to the initial AP story.

<HEADLINE> Friday's Commodities Roundup  </HEADLINE>
By DAVE CARPENTER, AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   Hog futures jumped 2 percent to their highest level in more than
a year Friday as rising beef prices intensified speculation that
more supermarkets and other retailers will showcase pork as a less
expensive alternative.
</P>
<P>
   In other markets, wheat rose and palladium fell.
</P>
<P>
   Rising demand for bacon, currently in vogue with fast-food
restaurants, has pushed pork futures higher for months. Frozen pork
bellies, the source of bacon, have been the prime beneficiary.
</P>
<P>
   But a continuing rally in lean hogs carried the near-term
contract, for April delivery, up 1.30 cent to 62.05 cents a pound
Friday on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   ''The beef market by itself has put on about $9 (a pound) in the
last two weeks. It gives you the idea that the retailer will now
take a stronger look at maybe using pork in their ads,'' said Dave
Maher, an analyst for Securities Corp. of Iowa, based in Cedar
Rapids.
</P>
<P>
   The balmy recent weather in the Midwest also has contributed to
hogs' ascent. Maher said hogs have fattened up and been slaughtered
earlier than normal because they didn't burn off as much energy as
usual to stay warm.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've created a minor hole in marketing,'' he said. ''There
aren't as many available hogs as you'd expect at this time.''
</P>
<P>
   Don Roose, president of U.S. Commodities Inc. in West Des
Moines, Iowa, said the market caught up to the fact that hog prices
were lower than they should be. He also attributed the buying rush
in part to anticipation that the hog-and-pig report due out March
24 will be upbeat for the market.
</P>
<P>
   Wheat prices tumbled on the Chicago Board of Trade, tripped up
by a decline in soybeans and prospects of continuing precipitation
in the dry U.S. winter wheat belt over the next week.
</P>
<P>
   May wheat fell 3\ cents to $2.60 a bushel. May soybeans fell 6}
cents to $5.09} a bushel.
</P>
<P>
   Palladium futures resumed their off-and-on rally on the Comex
division of the New York Mercantile Exchange as Russia's
long-promised deliveries of the metal continued to be missing in
action. Trading was thin, with many investors on the sidelines due
to uneasiness over the wild volatility that has sent prices this
year to nearly double their previous all-time highs.
</P>
<P>
   Russian officials have finalized quotas of palladium, which is
in big demand to make catalytic converters in cars. But it's still
not clear when the world's No. 1 supplier of the metal will begin
shipping it out in large quantities again.
</P>
<P>
   June palladium rose $13 to $700 an ounce, still well short of
its recent all-time high of $835.

<HEADLINE> National group files lawsuit over sex, drug survey in Ridgewoodschools  </HEADLINE>
By RALPH SIEGEL, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) -- The national Rutherford Institute has
selected a Bergen County school district for a federal court battle
against student surveys they claim intrude on family privacy with
questions about drugs, sex and suicide.
</P>
<P>
   The survey administered by the Ridgewood schools to grades 7 to
12 last October was funded by the U.S. Department of Education.
</P>
<P>
   At issue in the lawsuit is not the content of the survey as much
as it is whether students took the survey voluntarily, and whether
parents were fully informed about it in advance.
</P>
<P>
   Institute lawyer Steven Aden said the nonprofit group, based in
Charlottesville, Va., has agreed to represent three Ridgewood
mothers in a federal lawsuit in order to end such practices
nationwide. He said school officials conducted the survey without
explicit consent from the parents, claiming the mothers and their
daughters -- aged 12, 15 and 16 -- were upset about the questions put
to them.
</P>
<P>
   ''The parents are livid and the girls are distraught and
somewhat angry, I think, that this kind of private matter has been
extracted from them,'' Aden said.
</P>
<P>
   Test questions cited in a Rutherford Institute press release
include: ''Have you ever tried to kill yourself?'' ''Do you use
heroin, morphine, or opium?'' and ''When you have sex, how often do
you use a birth control method?''
</P>
<P>
   ''The school did not tell the children when they administered
the test that it was voluntary,'' Aden said. ''They did not tell
them that they could sit quietly at their desks and do something
else.''
</P>
<P>
   Ridgewood school superintendent Frederick Stokley refuted Aden's
version of events. He said the district's parents were given
repeated notices throughout last year about the forthcoming survey,
including letters home. He said parents were free to pick up survey
copies in advance and could have asked at any time that their
children not be involved.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was in the works for almost two years,'' Stokley said.
''Many parents did come and look at it, and when they looked at it
they agreed with it.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I regret that some parents were offended,'' Stokley added,
''but we did this properly. No one was forced.''
</P>
<P>
   Aden said if notifications were done, they were slipshod. He
said the mothers in his lawsuit knew a survey was going to be
conducted at some point but received no specifics and had assumed
it would not proceed without a permission slip from them.
</P>
<P>
   Aden said the girls ''were not told how they would be treated if
they did not participate.''
</P>
<P>
   Stokley provided legal documents on file with federal
authorities that included a policy statement to all teachers and
officials who administered the survey: ''Students should be
informed that the survey is anonymous and voluntary.''
</P>
<P>
   It instructed officials to permit reluctant students to do other
work, and for those taking the survey to leave blank any questions
they did not wish to answer.
</P>
<P>
   Stokley said the survey was prepared by a Minnesota social
research firm, Search Institute, which collected the documents and
will prepare a general report on trends and social needs of young
people.
</P>
<P>
   ''Then it got politicized,'' Stokley said. ''The politics of
this is that there is an infringement of government on our lives.''
</P>
<P>
   ''It is really annoying. Here you are trying to do something,
involving kids and seeking their views, and you are getting
hammered for it,'' Stokley said. ''The intention was very positive,
and I think the results will be very helpful in guiding us to
better serve youth.''
</P>
<P>
   Aden said he suspected a more sinister motive.
</P>
<P>
   ''''It is a government thing. The government is probing,
extracting criminal information from their kids,'' Aden said. ''We
believe that is part of the school's desire to monitor particular
children and their potential problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Aden accepted Stokley's claim Ridgewood officials were not
monitoring anyone, but he said even if this is so, the potential
for misuse of such surveys is too great to ignore.
</P>
<P>
   The Rutherford Institute is often identified as conservative
because of the affiliations of its president, John Whitehead, with
religious causes and the anti-abortion movement. The group achieved
national attention for its role in the Paula Jones sexual
harassment case filed against President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The Rutherford Institute's most recent appearance in New Jersey
was in a lawsuit on behalf of a Medford first-grader forbidden from
reading a Bible story in class.
</P>
<P>
   But Aden said the Institute takes on civil liberties complaints
without regard to politics and is concerned only with undue
government intrusion. For instance, he cited the Institute's role
in defending a Georgia teacher fired in 1996 for refusing to submit
to a drug test.

<HEADLINE> GOP Budget Chairmen Reach Agreement  </HEADLINE>
By ALAN FRAM, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Breaking a weekslong deadlock, the Republican
chairmen of the House and Senate budget committees agreed Friday to
the outlines of a $1.8 trillion budget for next year that portends
an election-year confrontation with President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Under their framework, spending on many defense and domestic
programs would total $596.5 billion next year, $10.5 billion more
than this year, with increases planned for defense, education and
health. Clinton wants $625 billion, leaving the two sides nearly
$30 billion apart.
</P>
<P>
   The plan also envisions $150 billion for tax cuts from 2001
through 2005, and leaves the door open for at least $60 billion
more. Clinton has proposed $99 billion in tax cuts, offset almost
completely by $96 billion in tax increases.
</P>
<P>
   ''We think we've got a winner,'' said House Budget Committee
Chairman John Kasich, R-Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats didn't. They said the GOP plans for tax cuts and
defense spending would force cuts in many domestic programs and
ensure an autumn budget brawl.
</P>
<P>
   ''They're assuming unrealistic cuts in vital services from
health to environment, so they can either have significant tax cuts
or rely once again on end-of-year gimmicks and shell games,'' said
Gene Sperling, a White House economic adviser.
</P>
<P>
   The GOP package would also set aside $20 billion to $40 billion
over five years for a Medicare prescription drug benefit or other
changes to the program, plus $5 billion next year for financially
strapped farmers. And besides using all $978 billion in Social
Security surpluses to reduce the national debt, it would specify
that any money for tax cuts that Clinton vetoes would also go for
debt reduction.
</P>
<P>
   Kasich said his committee would vote on the measure next week.
The Senate Budget Committee chairman, Sen. Pete Domenici, R-N.M.,
said his panel will follow a week later.
</P>
<P>
   Their framework, for which details must still be completed, was
reached after weeks of talks with congressional leaders and
rank-and-file Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Kasich and many conservatives initially wanted to limit defense
and domestic programs to $586 billion, the same as this year. But
they agreed to the higher figure after it became clear there would
not be enough votes to pass a budget at the lower level.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our goal was to be unified,'' Domenici said.
</P>
<P>
   Republican leaders hope Congress will complete its budget by
mid-April to give lawmakers time to complete the rest of their work
and adjourn by early October so they can campaign for re-election.
</P>
<P>
   The measure, which does not need Clinton's signature, maps the
way for tax and spending bills that lawmakers will write later in
the year.
</P>
<P>
   Pushing the proposal through the Senate budget panel will take
work, because it has become tangled in GOP presidential politics.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, one of four conservatives on the
committee who want less spending than Domenici prefers, said he
would ''vigorously oppose'' it. Gramm wants to hold spending down,
in part to leave room for the $483 billion tax cut proposed by the
presumptive GOP presidential nominee, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ''If this budget is adopted, we will have found a surefire way
to stop the Democrats from spending the surplus -- have Republicans
spend it first,'' Gramm said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   GOP leaders, however, have already decided to keep their tax
cuts this year smaller than Bush's proposal to avoid Democratic
accusations that Republican tax plans would eat into Social
Security surpluses.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans hold a 12-10 majority on the Senate budget panel.
With Democrats likely to unanimously oppose the plan, Domenici will
have to reach some agreement with all of the conservatives because
the committee requires a majority vote to approve legislation.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans have already pushed separate tax-cut packages
through the House and Senate totaling $126 billion over five years.
Included have been reductions in taxes on small businesses, tax
incentives for people to save money for education and easing the
so-called marriage penalty, or extra taxes paid by many married
couples.
</P>
<P>
   The $596.5 billion in spending covers government programs, from
buying bullets to building dams, that Congress approves each year.
The remaining $1.2 trillion the government will spend next year
covers automatically made payments like Social Security benefits
and interest on the national debt.
</P>
<P>
   Defense would get $306.8 billion next year, $500 million more
than Clinton's request and about $16 billion more than this year's
total.

<HEADLINE> Diabetes Drug Controversy Mounts  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The government listed another three deaths
linked to the controversial diabetes drug Rezulin Friday -- bringing
the toll to 61 -- and is investigating a doctor's allegation that
the manufacturer once ''coerced'' her to downplay the risk.
</P>
<P>
   The Food and Drug Administration's newest investigation
involving the increasingly controversial drug comes as an FDA
physician asked Congress to probe why his bosses have not pulled
Rezulin off the market.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am writing to enlist your aid in convincing my superiors at
FDA that Rezulin should be removed from the market because of its
unacceptably high risk of causing liver failure,'' FDA medical
officer Dr. Robert Misbin wrote several congressmen this week,
mailing copies of e-mail exchanges illustrating growing pressure
within the agency to ban Rezulin.
</P>
<P>
   Also Friday, the FDA said it was investigating allegations by
Dr. Janet McGill of Washington University at St. Louis that
Rezulin's manufacturer ''coerced'' her in 1994 to downplay liver
problems in two patients on whom she tested the then-experimental
medicine.
</P>
<P>
   ''With more studies and years of clinical trials experience
behind me, I would not acquiesce to such a request under similar
circumstances today,'' she wrote the FDA.
</P>
<P>
   ''Dr. McGill's allegations are serious and must not be
ignored,'' the FDA said.
</P>
<P>
   Manufacturer Warner-Lambert Inc. angrily denied the claim and
urged the FDA to convene a public meeting of its scientific
advisers to clear the charge.
</P>
<P>
   ''Documents submitted to the FDA confirm that allegations in her
letter are inaccurate,'' the company said.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, the FDA said it now knows of 88 cases of liver failure
linked to Rezulin use; 61 of the patients have died. That is three
more deaths than the agency acknowledged earlier this week when a
consumer advocacy group urged that the drug be banned. The three
additional deaths were reported sometime since Feb. 22, the last
time FDA officials tallied Rezulin's toll.
</P>
<P>
   FDA managers insist Rezulin has benefited numerous diabetics
whose disease isn't helped by any other drugs, but the agency is
studying whether two chemically similar diabetes drugs are less
risky.

<HEADLINE> H.S. Player's Jail Term Remains  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO (AP) -- A high school basketball player sentenced to
five years in prison for elbowing an opponent during a game
remained in jail Friday when a judge declined to change his
sentence.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Mark Luitjen had until Friday to modify the sentence of
18-year-old Tony Limon. But he took no action, a court spokeswoman
said.
</P>
<P>
   Limon's attorneys had not expected Luitjen to change his mind,
defense lawyer Jack McGinnis II said. His lawyers will apply for
''shock probation,'' a form of punishment under which Limon would
serve up to six months, then be placed on probation.
</P>
<P>
   Limon was charged with aggravated assault after a January 1999
game between South San Antonio High School and East Central High
School.
</P>
<P>
   Videotape of the game showed Limon hitting Brent Holmes, a guard
for East Central, in the head with his forearm and knocking him
down. Holmes suffered cuts, a broken nose and a concussion,
requiring hospital treatment and surgery.
</P>
<P>
   No foul was called, and Limon played the rest of the game, which
South San Antonio lost. School officials later suspended Limon for
the rest of the season. He graduated that spring.
</P>
<P>
   He was indicted last summer by a Bexar County grand jury on an
aggravated assault-serious bodily injury charge. He agreed to plead
no contest in exchange for a sentence that could range from
probation to six years in prison, expecting to receive probation.
</P>
<P>
   But at sentencing Feb. 7, Luitjen gave him five years because
Limon already was on probation for attempted burglary.
</P>
<P>
   Limon said last week his coach, Gary Durbon, encouraged the
aggressive play.
</P>
<P>
   ''He told me it's about time someone shed blood,'' Limon said.
</P>
<P>
   Durbon denied the accusation.
</P>
<P>
   Holmes is suing Durbon and the school district for $6,000 in
medical expenses plus other damages.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Limon's mother, Olivia Ramsey, apologized for her
son's actions on ABC's ''Good Morning America.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I apologize again to the Holmes family for whatever hurt,
pain, inconvenience that this brought on to their family,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   But Ramsey also said she believes incidents on the basketball
court should not make their way into the courtroom.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have so many incidents. God knows there are NBA players
(that) are role models for us. They do it. And I've never heard of
any of them going to jail. None of them,'' she said. ''So why is
Tony any different?''

Judge to allow media into Skakel hearing   
prho
<TEXT>
<P>
   STAMFORD, Conn. (AP) -- The media will be allowed in the
courtroom when a 39-year-old nephew of the late U.S. Sen. Robert F.
Kennedy is arraigned as a juvenile on charges he murdered a
15-year-old neighbor in 1975.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Maureen Dennis ruled Friday on a request from five
newspapers and The Associated Press which had asked to open the
juvenile proceeding to the public, something prosecutors and
defense lawyers say they cannot remember happening before in
Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Skakel is being charged as a juvenile in the case
because he was 15 years old at the time Greenwich neighbor Martha
Moxley was bludgeoned and stabbed to death.
</P>
<P>
   The judge agreed with the newspapers' argument that Skakel has
already effectively waived his juvenile confidentiality rights,
both because he is an adult and because his name and the charges
against him are already well-known across the country -- made public
by his own attorney.
</P>
<P>
   Skakel's lawyer went even further last month, filing an
affidavit signed by Skakel in which Skakel says he does not object
to holding the hearings in public.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney Michael Sherman said Skakel wants the proceeding open
so that the public can hear his side of the story.
</P>
<P>
   ''Due to the respondent's age, the underlying rationale of the
confidentiality provision which would strongly apply in other
juvenile matters is inapplicable here,'' Dennis wrote. ''The tender
years of the respondent's minority and early formative years of
adulthood, logically comptemplated by the drafters of our
legislation, have long since passed.''
</P>
<P>
   The newspapers that sought to open hearing are The New York
Times, The Hartford Courant, Newsday, The Advocate of Stamford and
the Greenwich Time.
</P>
<P>
   David Fein, a lawyer representing the newspapers, said the judge
had to research decision in other states since such access has not
been granted before in Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   ''Ultimately the court concluded the public's interest was
compelling and the confidentiality concerns were minimal,'' said
Fein. ''We are gratified by the court's decision to open it to the
public.''
</P>
<P>
   The arraignment, scheduled for Tuesday, will be moved from a
small juvenile courtroom in a strip mall to the Judicial District
courthouse in Stamford.

<HEADLINE> US Businessman Kiam Wins Libel Case  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- A London jury decided Friday that American
businessman Victor Kiam had been libeled in a 1999 financial column
in the newspaper The Mirror, awarding him $166,000.
</P>
<P>
   Kiam -- who gained attention for TV ads for electric shavers, in
which he said, ''I liked the shaver so much, I bought the company''
-- maintained that The Mirror reporters made no attempt to verify
the story, which erroneously claimed he was going to get rid of his
Ronson lighter company.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think it was a fair result,'' Kiam said of the verdict.
</P>
<P>
   The High Court jury decided that the newspaper's ''City
Slickers'' column had unfairly reported in January 1999 that Kiam,
73, was going to ''pull the plug'' on Ronson.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, Kiam sold a large minority stake in the Remington
shaver company, and his 51 percent share of the New England
Patriots of the National Football League.

<HEADLINE> Continental Raises Air Fares  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON (AP) -- Continental Airlines attempted Friday to impose a
new fare increase of up to $40 per round trip, blaming the rising
cost of fuel.
</P>
<P>
   The airline led the industry in a $20 boost in January, but had
to back off on second increase of $30 two weeks ago after other
airlines wouldn't follow.
</P>
<P>
   ''I can't remember an airline raising fares this much in one
swoop,'' said Tom Parsons, an airline-industry observer for
Bestfares.com, an online discount travel service.
</P>
<P>
   ''People are seeing the prices at the pump, maybe Continental
thinks they can disguise this. They justify it saying it is fuel
... they just need more money in the bank,'' Parsons said.
</P>
<P>
   Generally when airlines raise fares, the hikes will remain in
place if their competitors also raise fares. Otherwise, the fare
hikes are repealed, as happened in February.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, Fort Worth-based American Airlines and Delta Air
Lines joined Continental in attempting to raise fares, while
Dallas-based Southwest Airlines, Northwest Airlines and America
West held out. The fare hike was eventually abandoned.
</P>
<P>
   This time, Continental, the nation's fifth-largest carrier, is
attempting to raise fares for roundtrip flights up to 500 miles by
$20, between 500 and 1,000 miles by $30 and flights more than 1,000
miles by $40.
</P>
<P>
   If the most recent hike sticks, roundtrip fares on Continental
and other airlines will have increased by as much as $60 since
January. As of Friday afternoon, Continental's most recent move had
not been followed by other airlines, however, putting the latest
increase in doubt.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Dallas-based Southwest Airlines said the carrier
does not plan to raise fares.
</P>
<P>
   ''To be sure, fuel prices are a terrible, terrible thing for the
entire industry,'' said Ed Steward. ''But the news with Continental
is just news with us. We are obviously trying to watch costs and
govern ourselves accordingly.''
</P>
<P>
   In response to the costlier fuel, Southwest in January raised
fares up to $8 per round trip, Steward said.
</P>
<P>
   Northwest Airlines has partially matched Continental on certain
fares, such as those in limited markets or promotions, said Jon
Austin, a spokesman for Eagan, Minn.-based carrier.
</P>
<P>
   Typical fares such as walkups, 7- and 21-day fares did not
increase, Austin added. ''We haven't filed any actions regarding
those fares,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   US Airways and Tran World Airlines also did not follow
Continential Friday, but were silent on what future actions the
carriers may take.
</P>
<P>
   Spokesmen for both airlines said they were studying the matter
and had not made a decision.
</P>
<P>
   Officials from American Airlines and Delta Air Lines did not
immediately return calls for comment.

<HEADLINE> Gene Therapy Panel Doesn't Vote  </HEADLINE>
By PAUL RECER, AP Science Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- An advisory committee to the National
Institutes of Health debated a proposal calling for a moratorium on
human gene therapy experiments, but then adjourned without taking a
vote.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal, formally presented to the committee Friday by a
Washington activist group, called for a halt to gene therapy
experiments except as a ''last resort for life threatening
illness.''
</P>
<P>
   The motion by the Foundation of Economic Trends cited the death
last fall of a Tucson teenager, along with hundreds of reported
adverse reactions among patients enrolled in gene therapy as
reasons to ''impose an immediate moratorium'' on gene therapy
experiments.
</P>
<P>
   Committee member Nancy King of the University of North Carolina,
Chapel Hill, said the idea was flatly rejected by a subcommittee
that studied the proposal.
</P>
<P>
   The full committee adjourned without ever presenting the
proposal for a vote. The committee has no power to block gene
therapy, but its recommendations are closely monitored by the Food
and Drug Administration which has approval authority for such human
experiments.
</P>
<P>
   In her report, King said the part of the proposal suggesting
experimentation could continue for those with life threatening
illnesses ''comes perilously close to saying terminally ill
patients are expendable.''
</P>
<P>
   King said the subcommittee felt it was possible to increase the
safety and oversight of gene therapy experiments, while advancing
the science. To shut down the gene studies, she said, ''would halt
or postpone at least some demonstrably low-risk, but potentially
valuable research.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeremy Rifkin, president of the group that presented the
proposal, repeatedly cited the death of Arizonian Jesse Gelsinger,
18, who died four days after starting a gene therapy experiment at
the University of Pennsylvania. Gelsinger's death last September is
the first known to have been caused by gene therapy.
</P>
<P>
   ''Are you waiting for a second Jesse Gelsinger?'' Rifkin asked.
</P>
<P>
   He also said that researchers have an inadequate understanding
of the effects of engineered viruses used to deliver genes to the
cells of patients. And Rifkin said that no patient has been cured
by the new therapy.
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, Rifkin said that researchers have a financial
interest in gene therapy companies and, thus, have an economic
disincentive to report bad news from gene therapy experiments.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is greed here,'' said Rifkin. ''The process is so flawed
that I am skeptical we will find the best way to treat patients.''
</P>
<P>
   A cancer patient, Charles Rogers of Houston, however, strongly
supported the benefits of gene therapy, saying an experiment has
almost cleared his lung of cancer.
</P>
<P>
   In testimony that followed Rifkin's comments, Rogers said he was
diagnosed with cancer in both lungs in 1995. Conventional chemo and
radiation therapy put his disease into remission, he said, but it
reappeared in his right lung.
</P>
<P>
   Last August, said Rogers, he enrolled in an experiment in which
he received three infusions of genes that prompted his body to
attack the cancer. Within months, he said, his cancer was in full
retreat.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you wonder about gene therapy, look at me,'' said Rogers.
''I had a tumor in my right lung that was 3{ inches long and 1{
inches wide.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, he said, ''98 percent of the tumor melted away and it is
still getting smaller.''

<HEADLINE> Public Access at Waco Test Nixed  </HEADLINE>
By MICHELLE MITTELSTADT, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A court-ordered field test that will re-enact
aspects of the 1993 Waco siege to determine whether federal agents
fired any shots into the Branch Davidians' retreat will be closed
to the media, a federal judge ruled Friday.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge Walter Smith of Waco rejected news
organizations' argument that the test, due to be held next weekend
at Fort Hood in Texas, should be open as a matter of public
interest.
</P>
<P>
   ''The court has determined that the media have identified no
constitutional or common-law right that would entitle them to
access to this procedure,'' Smith wrote. ''Pre-trial matters are
not public components of a civil trial.''
</P>
<P>
   The judge, who ordered the test and is presiding over surviving
Davidians' wrongful-death lawsuit against the government, said the
test ''may be likened to a crime scene, which unquestionably may be
closed to the public and the press in order to preserve the
integrity of the evidence.''
</P>
<P>
   In a motion filed earlier this month, The Associated Press,
Dallas Morning News, The New York Times and St. Louis Post-Dispatch
said a private field test ''will only increase the public's
skepticism about whether all the facts surrounding the Branch
Davidian raid have been completely and accurately disclosed.'' The
Waco Tribune-Herald also pressed for public access.
</P>
<P>
   John Danforth, a former senator appointed special counsel by
Attorney General Janet Reno to investigate the government's conduct
during the Davidians' 1993 standoff with federal agents, argued
against media attendance. ''The quickest way to discredit an
investigation is to provide the media with selective information
during its course,'' the special counsel wrote in a motion.
</P>
<P>
   The government and Davidians' lawyers did not oppose public
access.
</P>
<P>
   A lawyer representing the news organizations expressed
disappointment with the judge's order.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't believe Judge Smith or the special counsel have
identified any reason that justifies shrouding this field test in
secrecy,'' Dallas attorney John Gerhart said. ''This test goes to a
critical issue of whether or not the government fired weapons
during the raid. And continued secrecy on such a critical point
should not be allowed unless compelling circumstances force that
secrecy.''
</P>
<P>
   The Davidians' lead counsel said the public interest would have
been served by an open test.
</P>
<P>
   ''I just think it's unfortunate for the process because
inevitably there will be some people who will read into this some
sinister purpose, which is really not there,'' said Houston lawyer
Michael Caddell. ''I do think there would be a tremendous benefit
created by having press access and having someone that people would
view as not having any agenda other than to report the facts.''
</P>
<P>
   The government has long denied that its agents fired shots on
April 19, 1993, during the waning hours of a 51-day siege. Davidian
leader David Koresh and some 80 followers died during the inferno
that occurred several hours into an FBI tank-and-tear gas operation
designed to flush the sect members from their retreat.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for the Davidian plaintiffs, whose case goes to trial in
mid-May, contend the FBI's aerial infrared surveillance footage
offers definitive proof of gunfire directed into the building as it
burned.
</P>
<P>
   The field test, which will use a British Royal Navy helicopter
equipped with an infrared camera much like the one used by the FBI
in 1993, is designed to determine whether bursts of light on the
Waco infrared footage represent gunfire.
</P>
<P>
   Weapons similar to those carried by the Davidians and federal
agents will be fired during the test. Military tanks like those
used in 1993 also will be deployed.

<HEADLINE> Domestic Rigs Down By 22 To 768  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON (AP) -- The number of rigs actively exploring for oil and
natural gas in the United States decreased this week by 22 to 768.
</P>
<P>
   Of the rigs running nationwide, 174 were exploring for oil and
594 were looking for gas, Houston-based Baker Hughes Inc. reported
Friday. During the same week last year, 534 rigs were operating in
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Baker Hughes has kept track of the count since 1944. The tally
peaked at 4,530 on Dec. 28, 1981, during the height of the oil boom
but set several record lows last year, bottoming out at 498 on
April 9, 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Of the major oil- and gas-producing states, Oklahoma gained two
rigs and Louisiana one.
</P>
<P>
   Texas declined by six, Wyoming by five, California two and New
Mexico one.
</P>
<P>
   Alaska was unchanged.

<HEADLINE> Arias Says He'll Run Against Chavez  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) -- A former army officer who helped
President Hugo Chavez stage his 1992 coup attempt announced Friday
he'll run for the presidency, posing a potentially serious
challenge to Chavez.
</P>
<P>
   Francisco Arias, the popular governor of oil-rich Zulia,
Venezuela's second most-populous state, has the backing of the
other two officers who helped Chavez lead the failed coup effort in
1992.
</P>
<P>
   The three fell out with Chavez in what has become the most
serious rift in the president's leftist coalition since he took
office in February 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Chavez's former comrades in arms have accused the president of
betraying the original revolutionary goals of their rebellion,
which they said were based on the ideals of independence hero Simon
Bolivar.
</P>
<P>
   ''The president grabs power, and seeks permanency in his
power,'' Arias said as he announced his candidacy in the May 28
elections. ''A revolution can't be based on one man who dominates
the various structures of power. We won't have democracy.''
</P>
<P>
   Since taking office, Chavez, a former paratrooper, has decimated
Venezuela's traditional political parties and pushed through a new
constitution that eliminated the Senate and increased the power of
the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   That constitution requires new elections for all government
posts. Chavez has described the May 28 vote -- in which 6,236 public
offices will be contested -- as the ''final battle in the
revolutionary project.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the challenge mounted by Arias, Chavez enjoys approval
rating of around 70 percent and is expected to win May's elections.

<HEADLINE> Mattel Co. Laying Off Workers  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL WHITE, AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   EL SEGUNDO, Calif. (AP) -- Mattel Inc. has begun laying off
Interactive Division employees as part of a previously announced
restructuring of troubled operations that made up the company's old
The Learning Company software subsidiary.
</P>
<P>
   Mattel officials declined on Friday to say how many people will
lose their jobs. The number was placed at about 500, or about 16
percent of The Learning Company work force, said sources familiar
with the reorganization.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're not quantifying the layoffs at this point,'' said Mattel
spokesman Glen Bozarth.
</P>
<P>
   Mattel employs 31,000 people worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   Mattel will close as many as 15 of 20 facilities, including
sales offices, warehouses and other operations in California and
other states, said one source, who spoke on the condition of
anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   Mattel's plan to restructure The Learning Company business was
announced last month when the company released its 1999 financial
results. Mattel said at the time that it would take a first-quarter
charge of $75 million to $100 million to cover costs of the
downsizing.
</P>
<P>
   Troubles at The Learning Company have plagued Mattel since it
acquired the software publisher last year for $3.6 billion, and
eventually forced Jill Barad to step down as Mattel's chairman and
chief executive officer.
</P>
<P>
   Barad resigned last month after Mattel reported a steep
fourth-quarter loss.
</P>
<P>
   The Learning Company was expected to immediately add $50 million
annually to Mattel's revenue. Instead Mattel lost $105 million in
the third quarter due to a number of problems with the software
division, including too many returns of unsold merchandise.
</P>
<P>
   The Learning Company revenues also were hurt by an overstaffed
sales and marketing department and rebate programs that ate into
revenues.
</P>
<P>
   Since Barad stepped down, Mattel's board of directors has run
the company and overseen the search for a new chairman and CEO.
Board member William Rollnick was appointed acting chairman and
director Ronald Loeb became acting CEO.
</P>
<P>
   Last year Mattel integrated The Learning Company into its
interactive toys and software unit. The Learning Company still
exists as a brand, but not as an operating division within Mattel.

<HEADLINE> Sweden's Ruling Party Adopts Euro  </HEADLINE>
By KIM GAMEL, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) -- The ruling Social Democrats voted to
adopt the euro late Friday but decided to leave any final decision
about the European Union's common currency up to a national
referendum.
</P>
<P>
   Delegates to the party's agenda-setting convention approved the
leadership's recommendation to change their policy from refusing to
join the EU's fiscal and monetary union to agreeing to do so -- but
later.
</P>
<P>
   Facing declining public support for the European Monetary Union,
the leadership endorsed a popular call for a national referendum.
</P>
<P>
   ''The party leadership has listened to the message of the
congress,'' Foreign Minister Anna Lindh told the 350 delegates in
announcing the party's decision to support a referendum.
</P>
<P>
   The euro is still a long way from becoming a reality in this
Scandinavian country, but the party's support was expected to
influence public opinion in its favor.
</P>
<P>
   Party guidelines specify that wage increases in Sweden must keep
pace with those in the rest of the 15-member European Union and
Sweden must be given room to make policies, if necessary, to
counteract any downturn in the economy.
</P>
<P>
   Eleven EU countries launched the common currency on Jan. 4, 1999
for corporate and investment transactions, in hopes that it would
increase European integration along with borderless travel and
virtually free trade. Euro coins and bank notes won't be introduced
until Jan. 1, 2002.
</P>
<P>
   Denmark, Sweden and Britain opted not to adopt the euro in its
initial phase. Greece, which was not allowed in because of its high
inflation and budget deficit, is hoping to join next year.
</P>
<P>
   Danish Prime Minister Poul Nyrup Rasmussen announced Thursday
that a national referendum on the currency would be held Sept. 28,
and urged voters to say ''yes.''
</P>
<P>
   Swedish Prime Minister Goeran Persson congratulated his fellow
Social Democrats in Denmark in his opening remarks. He said the
euro was far from perfect but it was the best way to retain
international influence and protect Sweden's welfare state.
</P>
<P>
   ''The new economy is an environment where the winds change
quickly and national boundaries mean less and less,'' Persson said.
''I have become convinced the EMU is the best protection, the best
counterweight against the growing market forces.''
</P>
<P>
   Persson had to take the podium at one point in the voting when a
last-minute amendment was offered insisting the European Monetary
Union and its central bank must be more democratic and that there
be an option to oust the bank's governors.
</P>
<P>
   The amendment was rejected after Persson announced that it would
reverse an earlier vote in favor of joining the EMU.
</P>
<P>
   Many analysts had predicted that any final decision would be
left to a referendum and said an outcome was far from predictable.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's more of a risk for (the party leadership) because we have
such volatile opinion polls regarding the EMU,'' said Heidi
Eskelinen, who analyzes the Swedish economy for Handelsbanken, one
of Scandinavia's largest banks. ''You can't really guarantee that
there will be a yes outcome.''

<HEADLINE> Bonds Fall on Inflation Fears  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Bond prices fell Friday amid concerns about
inflation reports that are due to come out next week.
</P>
<P>
   The price of the 30-year Treasury bond fell 11/32 point, or
$3.43} cents per $1,000 in face value. The yield, which moves the
opposite direction, rose to 6.17 percent from 6.15 percent late
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Treasury prices moved lower Friday because of investor fears
that key economic data, coming out next week, may indicate the
economy is overheating. The most important report next week is
February's consumer price index, on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Prices of short-term Treasury securities were down [ point,
while intermediate term securities fell 3/16 to 5/16, according to
Bridge Telerate.
</P>
<P>
   Yields on three-month Treasury bills were 5.86 percent, with the
discount up 0.03 percentage point from Thursday to 5.69 percent.
Six-month bills yielded 6.09 percent, as the discount rose 0.03
percentage point from Thursday to 5.81 percent. One-year yields
were 6.21 percent, with the discount rising 0.05 percentage point
to 5.85 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Yields are the interest bonds pay by maturity, while the
discount is the interest at which they are sold.
</P>
<P>
   The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between
banks, fell to 5.75 percent from 5.81 percent late Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The Bond Buyer index of municipal bonds fell 1/32 to 93 13/32.

<HEADLINE> SEC Won't Extend Decimal Stock Date  </HEADLINE>
By MARCY GORDON, AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal regulators said Friday they will not
extend their July 3 deadline for U.S. stock exchanges to begin
trading stocks in decimals, despite a request for a delay by the
brokers' group that operates the Nasdaq Stock Market.
</P>
<P>
   The group, the National Association of Securities Dealers, told
the Securities and Exchange Commission this week that its computer
systems aren't ready to handle a switch to decimals. The NASD asked
for a delay until next year.
</P>
<P>
   The NASD request also threw into question the timing of a move
to decimals by the rival New York Stock Exchange, since the two
biggest exchanges likely would coordinate their conversions.
</P>
<P>
   In January, the SEC ordered the nation's stock exchanges to
begin quoting at least some share prices in dollars and cents by
July 3, requiring them to fully abandon the 200-year-old use of
fractions by year's end. Under the SEC's plan, some stocks are to
begin trading in 5-cent increments, with many possibly trading in
penny increments by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   ''At this point, the (SEC) has not extended the July 3, 2000,
date for implementing decimal prices,'' the agency said in a
statement issued Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The SEC said it is discussing with the stock exchanges ''how to
implement decimals in a way and in a timeframe that does not
threaten the well-earned confidence that U.S. investors have placed
in our markets.''
</P>
<P>
   The SEC did give the securities industry an extra month, until
April 14, to submit its plan for phasing in decimal trading. The
exchanges also were given another month, until April 28, to file
their proposals.
</P>
<P>
   Nasdaq spokesman Scott Peterson suggested that the SEC might
decide to extend the deadline after reviewing the industry's plans.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think that anyone is going to force us to meet a
deadline that we have clearly stated we're not ready for,'' he
said. ''That wouldn't make sense.''
</P>
<P>
   Ray Pellecchia, a spokesman for the New York Stock Exchange,
reiterated the NYSE's declaration that it is ready to start
switching to decimals by July 3. He declined further comment.
</P>
<P>
   ''The imperative is that we do it right and we do it well,''
said James Spellman, a spokesman for the Securities Industry
Association, which supports the NASD's request for a delay.
</P>
<P>
   In a report released last week, congressional investigators said
Nasdaq could have technical problems preparing its computer systems
for the increased volume of stock quotes from decimal trading. So
far this year, Nasdaq has experienced several days in which more
than 2 billion shares were traded.
</P>
<P>
   Nasdaq had said in January it would be ready to trade in 5-cent
increments on July 3.
</P>
<P>
   As an interim step, Nasdaq, the NYSE and some regional exchanges
have been quoting stocks in minimum increments of one-sixteenth of
a dollar, instead of the customary one-eighths. In decimals, a
sixteenth is 6.25 cents and an eighth is 12.5 cents.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters say adopting the decimal system would narrow the
difference between a stock's best bid and asking prices, known as
the spread. Spreads typically vary from 12{ cents to 50 cents, an
amount that adds up to a sizable profit for brokers, who take in a
percentage based on the size of the spread.
</P>
<P>
   Proponents of decimalization argue that a narrower spread will
increase the competitiveness and efficiency of markets, increase
trading volume and improve liquidity.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, critics say the narrower spreads in decimal trading
would erode profits, something that could reduce the number of
market makers, the firms which form a market's backbone.

<HEADLINE> FCC Approves Qwest, U S West Merger  </HEADLINE>
By KALPANA SRINIVASAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal regulators signed off conditionally
Friday on the $46 billion merger of Qwest Communications and U S
West on Friday. But signs of strain between the two
telecommunications companies raised questions about how they will
make the marriage work.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Communications Commission's approval of the deal
with conditions came just after the collapse of Qwest Chairman Joe
Nacchio's hopes to strike a deal with Deutsche Telekom AG to take
over both Qwest and U S West.
</P>
<P>
   When the German telephone company walked away Thursday, Qwest
blamed U S West for scuttling the talks. U S West, which last week
threatened to sue Qwest, said it was protecting its shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   ''I certainly had a negative view of the Qwest-U S West merger
to begin with,'' said Drake Johnstone, an analyst with Davenport &AMP;
Co. investment firm of Richmond, Va. ''Now when you throw on top of
that the clear animosity between the management teams, why would
anyone want to own the combined company?''
</P>
<P>
   The FCC approval requires Qwest -- a long-distance telephone and
Internet carrier -- to shed the 6 percent of its long-distance
customers in U S West's 14 Western states. By law, U S West -- a
Baby Bell -- cannot offer long-distance service to its local
customers without first showing that its local markets in those
states are open to competition. Since that applies to data traffic
as well, the companies must also address data traveling on Qwest's
massive Internet pipes that originate in U S West states.
</P>
<P>
   The companies must now produce a divestiture plan for the FCC.
Qwest executives say they are already in active negotiations with a
buyer for those customers.
</P>
<P>
   FCC Chairman Bill Kennard said Friday the deal would give U S
West major incentives to open its markets to competition so it can
offer long-distance service.
</P>
<P>
   Not lost on the regulator was the irony of the FCC approval
timing, just as tensions spiked between the merger partners.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think (the approval) is good news for Joe Nacchio, I'm not
sure that it's good news for Joe Nacchio, but I think it is,''
Kennard joked at a telecommunications symposium.
</P>
<P>
   While Nacchio later claimed he is committed to the U S West
acquisition, he acknowledged his timeline seems to be dragging out.
The companies are still seeking approval from seven states. On
Friday, Nacchio said he expects the merger to be delayed into the
third quarter -- beyond the previously expected midsummer closing
date -- because of obstacles at the state level.
</P>
<P>
   ''The pressure now is to get state approvals, and as you know
that has been a difficult journey,'' Nacchio said on a conference
call.
</P>
<P>
   Under the original merger deal between the companies, they
agreed to complete the transaction by the end of the year. If they
fail to make that deadline, either company would have the right to
walk away.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts speculated that a stall tactic could give Qwest an
escape hatch out of the deal.
</P>
<P>
   ''Maybe Qwest is hoping they can hang their hat on regulatory
issues to hope the merger drags out to the end of the year,'' said
Johnstone. ''My guess is, that might be their endgame right now, to
hope it drags out so they can back out.''
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, U S West officials said the state approval process
is progressing well, and talks with Iowa and Utah are inching
toward closure.
</P>
<P>
   The FCC approval ''caps a week of significant regulatory
progress on the merger,'' said spokesman David Fish.
</P>
<P>
   Notably, in Minnesota -- one state where progress has been slow --
Qwest officials have taken the lead in working with regulators.
</P>
<P>
   But questions remain about whether acrimony between the two
companies will make a seamless union possible. When Deutsche
Telekom ended talks to acquire the U.S. companies, Qwest
immediately pointed the finger at U S West.
</P>
<P>
   ''If it was a tactic, it was not a very shrewd tactic, because
it blew up in their face,'' Nacchio said. ''It's unfortunate right
now that the opportunity has been missed.''
</P>
<P>
   Investors seemed to agree. In Friday's trading on the New York
Stock Exchange, Qwest's stock tumbled 12 percent, falling $7.25 per
share to $52.75, and shaving several billion dollars off the value
of the deal. Shares of U S West fell $6.12{ to $70.37{, a loss of 8
percent.
</P>
<P>
   U S West was left out of the initial talks between Qwest and the
German telecommunications company. The Baby Bell later came back
and said it ''would consider taking steps to facilitate any
additional transaction'' as long as the new offer did not
jeopardize the pending merger. U S West also said any new buyer's
bid would have to at least match Qwest's offer.
</P>
<P>
   However, Qwest officials said U S West would not consider any
alternative transaction.

<HEADLINE> Vatican Approves Drexel Sainthood  </HEADLINE>
By BILL BERGSTROM, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Pope John Paul II approved sainthood Friday
for Katharine Drexel, a Philadelphia socialite who took a vow of
poverty and devoted her fortune to helping poor blacks and American
Indians.
</P>
<P>
   Drexel, who died in 1955, will be canonized Oct. 1 in St.
Peter's Square at the Vatican, said Philadelphia Archbishop
Cardinal Anthony Bevilacqua.
</P>
<P>
   ''Catholics everywhere, and especially in the Archdiocese of
Philadelphia, will rightfully rejoice at this great news,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Drexel will be only the second American-born saint; the other is
Sisters of Charity founder Elizabeth Ann Seton, canonized in 1975.
</P>
<P>
   At the Sisters of the Blessed Sacrament, the order Drexel
founded in 1891, the pope's decision was announced on a public
address system in the quarters for the 140 nuns. Drexel is entombed
at the convent in Bensalem.
</P>
<P>
   ''There was clapping and cheering all over the place,'' said
Sister Beatrice Jeffries, vice president of the order. She added,
''We're happy that the church and the world will know about blessed
Katharine and her work and the work of our sisters.''
</P>
<P>
   The Vatican confirmed Drexel's first miracle in 1998 -- curing
Robert Gutherman of deafness. On Jan. 28, the pope credited Drexel
with a second miracle -- curing the deafness of 7-year-old Amanda
''Amy'' Wall. The girl's family had prayed to Drexel and touched
objects that had belonged to her to Amanda's ears.
</P>
<P>
   At Philadelphia's Drexel University, founded by Katharine's
uncle Anthony Drexel in 1891, President Constantine Papadakis
announced a full scholarship, valued at $80,000, for Amanda should
she decide to attend the school.
</P>
<P>
   Katharine Drexel was born in 1858, the daughter of Francis
Drexel, a banking magnate and business partner of J.P. Morgan. She
was raised in a world of mansions, world travel and private tutors,
but the family also distributed food, clothing and money three
times a week from its mansion.
</P>
<P>
   At 30, Drexel entered a convent and used her $20 million
inheritance to establish a missionary order. In her lifetime, the
order established 12 American Indian schools and more than 100
rural and inner-city schools for black students, including New
Orleans' Xavier University, the only historically black Catholic
college in the country. She died at 96.
</P>
<P>
   Philadelphia will become the only diocese in the United States
with two canonized saints. John Neumann, the Bohemian-born fourth
Bishop of Philadelphia, was canonized in 1977.

<HEADLINE> Police officer, other officials charged with stealing from dead  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   CLIFFSIDE PARK, N.J. (AP) -- A police officer and several other
Cliffside Park officials were charged Friday with stealing
furniture, a furnace and a car from the house of a dead man, then
setting a fire in his house.
</P>
<P>
   Sgt. Frank Biasco, Construction Official Robert Cimmino and Fire
Official David Biasco were among eight people indicted on charges
of official misconduct, theft, arson, witness tampering and other
offenses.
</P>
<P>
   Also indicted were town employees Michael Ciccone, an employee
of the Department of Public Works, and Tony Issa, a volunteer
firefighter.
</P>
<P>
   Biasco, 33, of Cliffside Park and Issa, 27, of Cliffside Park,
were charged in May with the scheme to steal the contents of
Frederick Erdos' home.
</P>
<P>
   Erdos died of lung cancer on May 16, 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Biasco, who worked part-time as a construction foreman,
supervised an emergency cleanup of Erdos' home to remove hazardous
chemicals in a move to cover up the theft of all the contents from
his home, the indictment said.
</P>
<P>
   Materials taken included an antique dining room table and
chairs, a china cabinet and several pieces of scrap metal.
</P>
<P>
   The others indicted were charged with helping with the emergency
cleanup, selling Erdos' furniture and his car and covering up the
incident.
</P>
<P>
   Erdos' home burned down on Jan. 28, 1999. Issa was charged with
setting the fire.
</P>
<P>
   The defendants will be arraigned within four to six weeks,
Assistant Bergen County Prosecutor Michael Maher said.
</P>
<P>
   Sgt. Biasco had been suspended without pay since his arrest in
May, but last month won an arbitrator's ruling to restore his pay,
said his attorney Jim Patuto.
</P>
<P>
   ''He has nothing to do with this,'' said Patuto, who said
prosecutors are relying on information from other people involved
in the cleanup. Those people ''are attempting to shift the blame
from themselves to other people,'' Patuto said.
</P>
<P>
   Attorneys for other defendants could not be reached for comment
late Friday.

<HEADLINE> Teacher admits molesting Christian school students  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   GOSHEN, N.Y. (AP) -- A former first-grade teacher at a Christian
school has admitted molesting several young male students, state
police said.
</P>
<P>
   Ty Whitney, 28, was arraigned Thursday on two felony counts of
first-degree sexual abuse and a misdemeanor charge of endangering
the welfare of a child.
</P>
<P>
   He was arrested Wednesday near his parents' home in Marathon,
five days after resigning from his teaching job.
</P>
<P>
   Goshen Christian School Principal John DeVries declined to
comment.
</P>
<P>
   ''I would characterize him as cooperative, almost to the point
of being relieved,'' State Police Capt. John Melville said.
</P>
<P>
   The allegations came to light March 1, when a parent whose child
had described Whitney as acting inappropriately contacted the
school, Melville said.
</P>
<P>
   Whitney, a 1994 graduate of the State University at Cortland,
had worked at Goshen Christian School, which has more than 100
students from kindergarten through eighth grade, for three years.
</P>
<P>
   Before that, he taught at a private Christian academy and at a
public school in central New York, though Melville declined Friday
afternoon to disclose the schools' names or locations while police
were contacting staff there.

<HEADLINE> High Oil Prices May Hurt US Economy  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN NOLAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   CINCINNATI (AP) -- Rising oil prices have hit American consumers
at the gas pump and at the airline ticket counter, but few other
places so far.
</P>
<P>
   If the oil inflation continues that may soon change, as
evidenced this week by word from a major consumer products company
that its profits are suffering, due partly to rising costs of raw
materials.
</P>
<P>
   Procter &AMP; Gamble Co., maker of well-known consumer brands such
as Crest toothpaste, Pampers diapers and Tide detergent, said
Tuesday it will earn less than expected in the next quarter in part
because prices are rising for the petroleum-based materials it
needs for manufacturing.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street punished the company harshly, causing its stock to
fall from $87.43} on Monday, down to $53.37{ late Friday. Other
consumer products companies such as Colgate-Palmolive Co. and
Kimberly-Clark Corp. also saw their stocks suffer, although those
two firms took pains to tell investors their profit picture hasn't
changed.
</P>
<P>
   These companies use petrochemical-based products a number of
ways, from their plastic bottles to their detergents. They must
also pay higher prices for fuel for the trucks that deliver their
goods.
</P>
<P>
   Despite high gas prices, the auto industry hasn't really
suffered yet. Sales of light trucks increased by more than 10
percent from January to February, for instance.
</P>
<P>
   ''We sure aren't letting oil bother us,'' said David Wyss, chief
economist for Standard &AMP; Poor's DRI in Lexington, Mass. ''I'm
searching for an explanation (why) other than sheer stupidity.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, some other trouble signs are beginning to show
</P>
<P>
   Higher fuel costs for transporting products prompted Ford Motor
Co. on Monday to raise delivery charges for vehicles by $25, or 4
percent to 6 percent. General Motors Corp. is considering raising
its destination charge for shipment of products.
</P>
<P>
   FedEx Corp., the big shipper, said last week it would increase
the 3 percent surcharge it began last month to 4 percent.

   And, on Friday, Continental Airlines attempted to impose a new
fare increase of up to $40 per round trip, blaming the rising cost
of fuel. The airline led the industry in a $20 boost in January,
but had to back off on a second increase of $30 two weeks ago after
other airlines wouldn't follow.
</P>
<P>
   In seeking to explain why oil prices haven't spurred
significantly higher overall inflation, economists point out that
the country is less oil-dependent than it used to be.
</P>
<P>
   In 1981, the U.S. oil bill was about 6.5 percent of the gross
domestic product. Today, it is about 2 percent. That is partly
because of conservation and partly because, when adjusted for
inflation, oil prices have increased more slowly than other
consumer prices.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the need to spend more money filling up at the gas tank
could eat away at consumer spending -- the main engine of economic
growth -- if oil prices stay high for months, Wyss said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The money spent filling up at the gas tank is money you can't
spent at the mall. I think we'll start to see that later this
year,'' he said. ''It takes people a little while to adjust their
habits.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, P&AMP;G's chairman Durk Jager spent the better part of
the week devoting himself to damage control.
</P>
<P>
   He has been reassuring major investors that P&AMP;G will keep on its
long-term program of getting new products to market more quickly
and of increasing sales while ensuring that profits meet company
targets.
</P>
<P>
   ''The stock will ultimately come back. We hope it will be pretty
quickly, to restore investors' confidence,'' Jager told The
Associated Press during an interview Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ''People are still going to need diapers and toothpaste and
toilet paper,'' added P&AMP;G spokeswoman Linda Ulrey.
</P>
<P>
   Doug Christopher, an analyst with Crowell Weedon in Los Angeles,
agreed saying the stock has fallen too far.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was a real overreaction. ... The company does have a depth
of talent,'' Christopher said. ''This, too, shall pass.''

<HEADLINE> Argentina Flooding Kills 7  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) -- Several days of heavy rainfall
have caused severe flooding in northeastern Argentina, killing at
least seven people and forcing more than 10,000 people to flee
their homes, officials said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Steady rains and swollen rivers have washed out roads, downed
electrical and telephone lines and threatened the water supply in
at least five provinces, said Social Development Minister Graciela
Fernandez Meijide.
</P>
<P>
   Television footage showed people in rain gear wading through
muddy waters and others navigating in boats. Some areas reported
rainfall of five inches an hour.
</P>
<P>
   Civil Defense Director Antonio Medina said the mainly rural
Tucuman province was most affected. At least two towns located near
the banks of the Marapa River were evacuated, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The other provinces inundated include Jujuy, Santiago del
Estero, Catamarca, and Salta.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities did provide details on the seven deaths, saying only
that two of the victims, both men, had drowned.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities set up a relief center in Buenos Aires and
encouraged the public to send blankets, medicine and food for
victims. Helicopters were sent to deliver relief aid.
</P>
<P>
   Forecasters predicted heavy rainfall in the region through
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Flooding in 1998 caused by the El Nino global weather pattern
killed 17 people and forced at least 120,000 from their homes in
the northeastern part of Argentina.

<HEADLINE> Judge To Let Media in Skakel Hearing  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   STAMFORD, Conn. (AP) -- A judge's ruling Friday will allow the
media in the courtroom when a 39-year-old nephew of the late Sen.
Robert F. Kennedy is arraigned as a juvenile on charges he murdered
a 15-year-old girl in 1975.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Maureen Dennis' decision was in response to a request by
five newspapers and The Associated Press to open the juvenile
proceeding to the public, something prosecutors and defense lawyers
say they cannot remember happening before in Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Skakel is charged as a juvenile in the case because he
was 15 at the time his Greenwich neighbor Martha Moxley was
bludgeoned and stabbed to death.
</P>
<P>
   ''Due to the respondent's age, the underlying rationale of the
confidentiality provision which would strongly apply in other
juvenile matters is inapplicable here,'' Dennis wrote.
</P>
<P>
   The judge agreed with the news organizations' argument that
Skakel has already effectively waived his juvenile confidentiality
rights because he is an adult and because his name and the charges
against him were made public by his own attorney.
</P>
<P>
   Skakel's lawyer, Michael Sherman, filed an affidavit last month
in which Skakel says he does not object to holding the hearings in
public. Sherman said Skakel wants the proceeding open so the public
can hear his side of the story.
</P>
<P>
   The newspapers that sought to open the hearing are The New York
Times, The Hartford Courant, Newsday, The Advocate of Stamford and
the Greenwich Time.
</P>
<P>
   ''Ultimately the court concluded the public's interest was
compelling and the confidentiality concerns were minimal,'' said
David Fein, a lawyer representing the newspapers. ''We are
gratified by the court's decision to open it to the public.''
</P>
<P>
   The arraignment, scheduled for Tuesday, will be moved from a
juvenile courtroom to Stamford Superior Court.

<HEADLINE> ABC, Time Warner Postpone Deadline  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON (AP) -- ABC and Time Warner agreed to a third extension
in their high stakes fight over retransmission rights Friday, just
20 minutes before the network was to pull its affiliate from the
cable giant's Houston system.
</P>
<P>
   Time Warner and ABC, owned by The Walt Disney Co., now have
until March 31 to reach an agreement in their acrimonious brawl.
</P>
<P>
   ''We reached out to Time Warner this morning and they agreed to
continue good faith negotiations,'' KTRK-TV general manager Henry
Florsheim said when announcing the extension during the station's
11:30 a.m. newscast.
</P>
<P>
   Negotiations began again Friday, after breaking down again the
night before.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's about time Disney decided to stop holding Houston hostage
and give us the same extension that had already been granted to the
rest of the country,'' Time Warner Houston division president Ron
McMillan said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   The latest extension puts Houston on par with the six other
markets that are part of the 10-year retransmission agreement at
issue.
</P>
<P>
   ABC began threatening to withhold Time Warner's right to
retransmit KTRK last month, when negotiations over a national
retransmission deal broke down. Time Warner rejected a proposal
that would have cost $100 million and claims that Disney's latest
offer is now almost three times that much.
</P>
<P>
   ABC and other over-the-air networks have had the right to demand
compensation from cable providers in exchange for their programming
since Congress passed 1992's Cable TV Act.
</P>
<P>
   ABC claims negotiations broke down when the cable company
refused to put some of its products -- The Disney Channel, soap
opera channel SoapNet and Toon Disney -- on basic cable instead of
pay channels for most Time Warner customers.
</P>
<P>
   The company wants its products in the basic lineup alongside
similar Time Warner products.

<HEADLINE> Huge Zinc, Lead Spill in Romania  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) -- Six weeks after a major cyanide spill
in northwestern Romania, 20,000 tons of metal pollutants escaped
from a mine Friday in the same region, the government said.
</P>
<P>
   The new spill occurred when melting of snow and torrential rains
broke a dam at the state-owned Baia Borsa mine, sending a wave of
zinc and lead-laden waters into Vaser River.
</P>
<P>
   The environment ministry said in a statement that the polluted
waters were heading toward the Tisza and the Danube rivers, already
damaged by the previous escape of cyanide.
</P>
<P>
   Hungary said it was testing the waters of the Tisza. The Vaser
enters the Tisza near the Ukrainian-Romanian border.
</P>
<P>
   The hazardous metal pollution had already reached Ukraine and
was expected to be carried by the Tisza into Hungary Friday night,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   There was no immediate word of how much environmental damage
such an escape of pollution-laden water could cause. However,
Andrei Svoronos, head of Romania's Danube Delta natural reserve,
said he believed that the ore would not flow as far as the cyanide
did because it would settle into the river beds.
</P>
<P>
   The latest spill came six weeks after tons of cyanide-laden
waters spilled into a creek from the Aurul gold mine. The pollution
flowed into three Balkan rivers and the Danube, killing wildlife
and temporarily poisoning water supplies for river communities.

<HEADLINE> Belize, Guatemala To Hold Talks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   POINTE-A-PITRE, Guadeloupe (AP) -- Belize and Guatemala will meet
next week in Washington to resolve a simmering border conflict,
Belize's prime minister said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The talks, which will be sponsored by the Organization of
American States, will likely take place Tuesday, said Prime
Minister Said Musa.
</P>
<P>
   Musa was in Guadeloupe for a Franco-Caribbean summit, where he
said he is asking Caribbean leaders to support Belize against
Guatemala's latest claim to more than half of the former British
colony on the shoulder of South America - some 7,440 square miles.
</P>
<P>
   The talks would be the first since tensions began in February
when Guatemala arrested three Belizean soldiers and a police
officer near the border. Both sides say the arrested men were on
their side of the border. Guatemala asked Belize's ambassador to
leave over the incident and this month a bomb was discovered near
the Guatemalan Embassy in Belize City.

<HEADLINE> Engineer's Hunger Strike at 22 Days  </HEADLINE>
By CHRISTINE HANLEY, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   FRESNO, Calif. (AP) -- Engineer Martin Castellano is losing
weight, but not his faith, three weeks into a hunger strike during
slow-moving contract talks at television station Univision's Fresno
affiliate.
</P>
<P>
   ''My decision is to continue because I believe in my heart that
something good is going to come from all this,'' Castellano said
Friday, promising to continue consuming nothing but juice and water
until Spanish-language station KFTV offers a contract with better
wages and job security to its workers.
</P>
<P>
   Castellano plans to hold out as long as it takes. A father of
four, he earns $21,480 after 11 years with the station. The union
wants salaries raised by more than a third.
</P>
<P>
   The number of hunger-strikers has dropped from eight to three
since they began liquid-only diets Feb. 18. More than 20 bargaining
sessions have been held since the station presented a full contract
proposal Dec. 16, and another was held Friday in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ''The company is not moving on anything significant,'' said
Carrie Biggs-Adams, who is part of the negotiating team for the
National Association of Broadcast Engineers and Technicians Local
51. ''We're asking for wages that look more like what human beings
can afford to live on.''
</P>
<P>
   KFTV management has declined to comment except to say the
station is ''committed to negotiating in good faith and to arriving
at a resolution that is fair to all parties.''
</P>
<P>
   The station's general manager, Maria Gutierrez, did not return a
message left Friday. An assistant who called back later said
Gutierrez was out sick.
</P>
<P>
   The union wants salaries closer to local English-speaking
stations, where some anchors earn upwards of $100,000, and other
Univision affiliates.
</P>
<P>
   Union officials claim Univision is successful enough to afford
the raises, especially in Fresno, where KFTV repeatedly sweeps its
English-language rivals and has the highest ratings among major
adult groups of any of Univision's 15 stations.

<HEADLINE> Colombian Convicted for Bribery  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) -- A military airport employee has been
convicted of taking bribes to allow cocaine aboard a Colombian air
force plane seized two years ago in Florida, the judge in the case
said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The discovery of drugs aboard the air force C-130 cargo plane at
Fort Lauderdale's international airport in November, 1998, was an
embarrassment for President Andres Pastrana. Pastrana had taken
office three months earlier pledging to fight drug trafficking.
</P>
<P>
   Libardo Bernal, an employee at the Bogota airport, was sentenced
to nine years in prison in early January, but the conviction and
sentence were not made public until Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Bernal, 35, is the only Colombian convicted to date in the
seizure of 1,639 pounds of cocaine and 13 pounds of heroin. He was
given $23,000 for allowing the drugs on board.
</P>
<P>
   Nine other people face charges, including eight low-ranking
military members and a civilian, according to the judge.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, authorities in New York discovered heroin stashed in
the nose and luggage compartment of the official airplane of
then-President Ernesto Samper, who had arrived to address the
United Nations.

<HEADLINE> White House Worker Alleges Threats  </HEADLINE>
By PETE YOST, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- In court papers unsealed Friday, a former
White House contractor says she was threatened not to reveal a
problem with the White House e-mail system that concealed thousands
of messages from the Justice Department and congressional
investigators.
</P>
<P>
   The contractor, Betty Lambuth, says a subordinate told her some
of the e-mails deal with ''Vice President Al Gore's involvement in
campaign fund-raising controversies'' and ''the sale of Clinton
Commerce Department trade mission seats in exchange for campaign
contributions.'' The subordinate said the e-mail also contained
information on the White House's improper gathering of FBI
background files of long-ago Republican appointees and the Monica
Lewinsky scandal, Lambuth stated in her declaration.
</P>
<P>
   The document was unsealed by U.S. District Judge Royce Lamberth.
</P>
<P>
   Lambuth says she learned of a problem with the White House
e-mail system in May 1998 in the midst of Independent Counsel
Kenneth Starr's perjury and obstruction probe of the president in
the Lewinsky scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Asked to comment Friday, the office of Starr's successor,
Independent Counsel Robert Ray, said, ''We are aware of the
allegations regarding the e-mail issue, and we are taking
appropriate steps with regard to those allegations.
</P>
<P>
   ''Beyond that we can't comment,'' said Neille Mallon Russell, a
spokeswoman for Ray's office.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the e-mail problem, which began in August 1996 in the
midst of the Clinton-Gore re-election campaign, ''a significant
number of e-mails were ... not being searched in response to
subpoenas and document requests,'' Lambuth said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I learned that one of the computer e-mail servers, which
housed incoming e-mail to much of the Clinton White House staff,
approximately 500 individuals, was not being ... managed'' by the
automated records system. The system allows text to be searched in
response ''to subpoenas and other inquiries,'' said Lambuth, who
said the problem stemmed from ''an apparent programming error.''
</P>
<P>
   After Lambuth informed the White House, Office of Administration
counsel Mark Lindsay told her ''that if I or any of my team who
knew about the e-mail problem told anyone else about it we would
lose our jobs, be arrested and put in jail,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   She said Lindsay specified that she was not to tell even her
private-sector boss, Steve Hawkins, who she said eventually removed
her from her White House assignment when she refused to tell him
about the e-mail problem.
</P>
<P>
   Lambuth said she and her co-workers dubbed the e-mail problem
''Project X,'' and because of the threats, she and her staff took
to meeting in a park close to the New Executive Office Building and
in a nearby Starbucks when discussing the matter.
</P>
<P>
   Lambuth, who left the White House in July 1998, said she still
works for CEXEC, a subcontractor for Northrop-Grumman that helps
run and maintain the White House computer system.
</P>
<P>
   ''Lindsay and others on the Clinton White House staff who knew
why I wasn't telling Hawkins about the e-mail problem never
intervened with Hawkins to protect my job,'' Lambuth said in the
declaration.
</P>
<P>
   The White House, which has said it will complete an initial
review of the e-mail matter next week, did not respond to repeated
calls for comment regarding Lambuth's declaration.
</P>
<P>
   Lambuth's declaration was released in a lawsuit on the FBI files
controversy filed by a conservative group, Judicial Watch.
</P>
<P>
   The e-mail problem was publicly revealed last month by a former
White House employee, Sheryl Hall, who alleged in a declaration
that ''when the contractors told the White House about the problem,
they were threatened, warned not to discuss it. They were told the
documents were classified.''
</P>
<P>
   At a hearing Friday morning, the judge also unsealed a new
declaration by Hall in which she said the White House plans to get
rid of computer-taped archives and the contents of computer hard
drives of presidential aides who leave.
</P>
<P>
   A career staff member in the White House Office of
Administration ''told me that ... the Clinton-Gore White House
plans to destroy ... archival cartridge tapes'' and to ''reformat
the hard drives'' of departing White House staffers.
</P>
<P>
   Hall said there are archives cartridges for at least 500
departing staffers.
</P>
<P>
   Lamberth ordered Justice Department lawyer James Gilligan,
representing the White House in the case, to ensure that no hard
drives are reformatted and no cartridges destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, ''I want names of those responsible for
preserving'' the material, said Lamberth. Gilligan provided the
names of the White House custodians at a late-afternoon hearing in
the case attended by both Lambuth and Hall.

<HEADLINE> NATO Submarine Episode Downplayed  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) -- Former U.S. Defense Secretary Caspar
Weinberger is trying to calm a furor he sparked here by saying that
NATO submarines entered Swedish waters during the Cold War --
despite the country's neutral policy, a newspaper reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Weinberger, defense secretary under President Ronald Reagan,
said on Swedish television Tuesday that NATO submarines entered
Swedish waters with approval from officials here.
</P>
<P>
   That remark stunned Swedes, who jealously guard their
neutrality, and prompted the government to order a thorough
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   But Weinberger told the Svenska Dagbladet newspaper that he had
not been talking about NATO intruding on the small Nordic nation's
sovereignty. And he said he only knew about what happened during
his years as defense secretary, which were between 1981-87.
</P>
<P>
   ''As far as I know, NATO has never violated Swedish waters,''
Weinberger was quoted as saying in Friday's editions of Svenska
Dagbladet.
</P>
<P>
   In the Tuesday interview broadcast by the Swedish program
''Striptease,'' Weinberger said Sweden had allowed NATO submarines
into the nation's territory to test coastal defenses.
</P>
<P>
   ''NATO subs never entered Swedish waters without being given
approval beforehand,'' Weinberger said in that broadcast.
</P>
<P>
   The claim became top news in Sweden. The government vowed to
track down any Swedish officials who might have allowed NATO to
enter Swedish waters.
</P>
<P>
   ''This was such a sensational statement that there is reason to
seek a denial that is authoritative and cannot be questioned,''
Swedish Prime Minister Goeran Persson was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
   Persson said Swedes should not have been involved in any such
deals with NATO during the Cold War, when Sweden was on constant
guard against intrusions by Soviet submarines. In 1981, a Soviet
submarine ran aground near a Swedish navel base and was captured.
</P>
<P>
   The television show's producer, Thomas Lundkvist, said the
interview with Weinberger accurately reflected his remarks and that
he was not misinterpreted, as Weinberger later claimed.
</P>
<P>
   Other foreign military experts appearing on the show confirmed
Weinberger's statements. NATO has made no comment.

<HEADLINE> Palestinians: Israel Pullback Near  </HEADLINE>
By DANA BUDEIRI, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   RAMALLAH, West Bank (AP) -- Israel will soon carry out a long
overdue withdrawal from the West Bank as part of an agreement
reached this week to resume peace talks, a Palestinian negotiator
said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Israel will also release some Palestinian prisoners and start
talks with the Palestinians on an additional withdrawal from the
West Bank, Yasser Abed Rabbo said after a meeting of the
Palestinian Cabinet in the West Bank city of Ramallah.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat told the Cabinet the upcoming
withdrawal from 6.1 percent of the West Bank would take place
''within ten days'' but Abed Rabbo would not say if the pullout
would be before or after a four-day Muslim holiday beginning on
March 16.
</P>
<P>
   Friday evening was the start of the Jewish Sabbath and
government officials were not available for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak agreed in three
meetings they held this week to resume peace talks and reaffirmed
their commitment to reach a final peace accord by Sept. 13. The two
sides missed a Feb. 13 target date for achieving a framework for
the treaty.
</P>
<P>
   The talks had been stalled for a month due to disagreements over
the areas to be included in the next two withdrawals from the West
Bank.
</P>
<P>
   The two leaders agreed that negotiations on the broad outlines
of a final peace accord and an additional, so-called ''third
withdrawal'' would begin after the holiday in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The Israeli Haaretz newspaper reported Friday that Israel plans
to offer the Palestinians a state in the Gaza Strip and about half
of the West Bank, while annexing the parts where settlers live and
negotiating over the rest.
</P>
<P>
   Barak's office refused to comment on the front-page report in
the daily. Abed Rabbo denied the report.
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper report said Barak is putting together a proposal
for a long-term partial agreement instead of a full peace treaty
because he feels sensitive issues, like the future of Jerusalem and
the return of Palestinian refugees, cannot be resolved by
September.
</P>
<P>
   Under the plan, Israel would annex about 10 percent of the West
Bank -- areas where most of the 200,000 Jewish settlers there live --
and recognize a Palestinian state in about 50 percent of the West
Bank, along with the Gaza Strip. Negotiations would continue over
the rest of the territory and the outstanding issues.
</P>
<P>
   Abed Rabbo insisted that the Palestinians want all of the Gaza
Strip and West Bank as well as east Jerusalem -- territories Israel
captured in the 1967 Middle East war.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is nonsense and a trial balloon,'' Abed Rabbo said about
the Haaretz report. ''The Palestinian state exists and is sovereign
over all the Palestinian land occupied in the June 1967 war, with
its capital in Jerusalem. This is the only solution we will
accept.''
</P>
<P>
   Arafat rules about 40 percent of the West Bank and most of Gaza
as head of the Palestinian Authority, a self-rule body set up in an
interim agreement. Israel continues to control overall security.

<HEADLINE> 7 Candidates in Georgia Vote  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TBILISI, Georgia (AP) -- Seven candidates were registered for
Georgia's presidential elections by Friday's deadline, including
incumbent Eduard Shevardnadze who is seeking a second term.
</P>
<P>
   Shevardnadze, a former foreign Minister for the Soviet Union,
faces a prominent member of the Georgian Communist Party, several
regional officials and one fringe candidate who is currently in
jail on corruption charges.
</P>
<P>
   He has promised to bring his former Soviet country closer to the
West, expressed interest in joining NATO and criticized Russian
peacekeeping operations in the breakaway region of Abkhazia. All
are issues likely to play a large role in the election.
</P>
<P>
   Dzhumber Lominadze, chairman of the Central Election Committee,
confirmed the seven candidates for the April 9 election.
</P>
<P>
   Shevardnadze enjoys broad popularity in Georgia, and leads over
the other candidates in opinion polls.
</P>
<P>
   Other likely contenders include Aslan Abashidze, a regional
governor in Adzhariya on the Black Sea coast. Communist candidate
Dzhumber Patiashvili, a former first secretary in the Georgian
Communist party, also is expected to make a strong showing.

<HEADLINE> Hidden Ammo Probed in Murder Case  </HEADLINE>
By CHELSEA J. CARTER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVINE, Calif. (AP) -- Investigators said Friday they found
thousands of rounds of ammunition hidden under a false floor in the
home of a doctor who committed suicide before police could question
him about a failed plot to kill his partner.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, police and FBI agents found 21 canisters filled
with bullets, including machine gun rounds, hidden in the home of
Dr. Larry C. Ford, police Lt. Sam Allevato said. Investigators also
found six drums planted 7 feet deep in Ford's yard and said they
feared there were hazardous chemicals inside.
</P>
<P>
   Ford's attorney said the doctor worked for the CIA for 20 years,
and the Los Angeles Times reported that he had expertise in
chemical and biological weapons.
</P>
<P>
   ''We don't know what's inside, but we believe they are filled
with illegal weapons and hazardous materials,'' Allevato said.
</P>
<P>
   An FBI bomb squad X-rayed the canisters, which were to be pulled
out of the ground and taken to an FBI laboratory, Allevato said.
</P>
<P>
   Forty-nine homes and a school near Ford's home were evacuated
before digging started Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators believe Ford held answers to the attack on his
partner at Biofem Pharmaceutical Inc., James Patrick Riley. A
masked gunman shot and wounded Riley two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   Almost immediately, police focused on Ford. The two men were
trying to market a vaginal suppository to combat AIDS transmission
and believed the product would make millions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   But before police could question Ford, he committed suicide.
</P>
<P>
   Police have arrested a friend of Ford's and accused him of being
the getaway driver in the botched hit. They were searching for the
shooter.
</P>
<P>
   Ford once worked for the federal government on chemical weapons
and advised the South African Defense Force on how to protect
military personnel against biological attacks, the Los Angeles
Times reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Riley, who is in seclusion, issued a statement saying Biofem has
never had any involvement with toxic or hazardous chemicals.

<HEADLINE> Fortier Appeals Sentence Again  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER (AP) -- For the second time in less than a year, Michael
Fortier has appealed his 12-year prison sentence for his role in
the Oklahoma City bombing.
</P>
<P>
   In a brief filed Friday in the 10th U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals, Michael McGuire, Fortier's lawyer, argued that the
sentence is the result of a vindictive judge who erred by giving
Fortier a punishment well above federal guidelines for involuntary
manslaughter.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge G. Thomas Van Bebber sentenced Fortier to 12
years and fined him $200,000 in May 1998, but the federal appeals
court in Denver sent the case back to Van Bebber because he
mistakenly used guidelines for first-degree murder.
</P>
<P>
   Van Bebber last October reduced the fine to $75,000 but handed
down an identical 12-year sentence -- above the standard 4-year,
3-month sentence for involuntary manslaughter.
</P>
<P>
   McGuire called Van Bebber's rulings ''agenda-driven.''
</P>
<P>
   When Van Bebber re-sentenced Fortier, he said he would have
given him a longer sentence if not for ''the appearance of
vindictiveness.''
</P>
<P>
   Fortier -- in prison since August 1995 -- pleaded guilty to
failing to notify authorities about a plot to bomb the federal
building. He also was sentenced for helping to move and sell stolen
weapons and lying to FBI agents.
</P>
<P>
   Timothy McVeigh, a friend of Fortier's, was convicted on federal
murder charges and sentenced to death in the April 19, 1995,
bombing that killed 168 people and injured hundreds more. Terry
Nichols was sentenced to life in prison without parole.

<HEADLINE> Priest Charged Again in Bishop Death  </HEADLINE>
By WILL WEISSERT, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   GUATEMALA CITY (AP) -- After nearly two years of investigation,
Guatemalan authorities on Friday again charged a Roman Catholic
priest in the death of Bishop Juan Gerardi, a human rights leader.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors had been looking into whether the military was
involved, but the re-arrest of the Rev. Mario Orantes, Gerardi's
former assistant, suggests they have shifted their attention back
toward suspects in the church.
</P>
<P>
   Gerardi, 75, was bludgeoned to death on April 26, 1998, in the
garage of the northern Guatemala City seminary where he and Orantes
lived and worked.
</P>
<P>
   Gerardi was killed just two days after he had delivered the
Catholic Church's human rights report, which implicated Guatemala's
military in an overwhelming majority of the 200,000 deaths
resulting from the country's 36-year civil war.
</P>
<P>
   Orantes originally spent seven months in jail on murder charges,
but was released in February 1999, when human rights groups began
protesting that authorities were overlooking the military's
potential role in the killing.
</P>
<P>
   Though never officially cleared of wrongdoing, Orantes was
allowed to travel to Houston to seek medical treatment for an
undisclosed nervous system problem and escape reported death
threats.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Judge Flor de Maria Garcia summoned him back to
Guatemala City, where he has remained hospitalized, with his lawyer
insisting he is too sick to be taken into custody for questioning.
</P>
<P>
   The new charges against Orantes come a week after the judge
freed another suspect in the case, Jose Obdulio, a former
presidential guard with reputed military ties. The judge said
Monday that there was not enough evidence to hold Obdulio.
</P>
<P>
   Also in custody in connection with the murder are church cook
Margarita Lopez, Sgt. Byron Lima and his father, retired Col.
Disrael Lima.
</P>
<P>
   Thus far, Lopez and Orantes are the only suspects to face formal
charges.

<HEADLINE> Texas Court Lets Girl Have Abortion  </HEADLINE>
By CONNIE MABIN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas (AP) -- The Texas Supreme Court on Friday reversed
a lower court's decision that prevented a 17-year-old girl from
having an abortion without telling her parents.
</P>
<P>
   Under state law, an unmarried girl 17 or younger must notify a
parent that she intends to have an abortion or seek a court order
allowing her to bypass the law. A bypass can be granted only if a
local judge decides the girl is mature enough to make the decision
on her own.
</P>
<P>
   In the case ruled on Friday, the 17-year-old girl's bypass
request had been denied two weeks ago by a lower court, which said
she was not ''sufficiently well informed to make the decision to
have an abortion performed without notification to either of her
parents.''
</P>
<P>
   The Texas Court of Appeals upheld the lower court's ruling. The
girl's lawyer then appealed to the state Supreme Court, which
further defined what requirements must be met in order for a bypass
to be granted. The justices then sent the case back to the lower
court and asked it to review the girl's request in light of the
redefined rules.
</P>
<P>
   The lower court again refused the girl's request.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, the state Supreme Court reversed the lower courts'
ruling 5-4 without comment.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Nathan Hecht, who dissented, wrote that the higher
court's decision was made too quickly and without reviewing the
appeals court's reasons for denying the bypass.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first Supreme Court appeal heard since the parental
notification law went into effect Jan. 1.

<HEADLINE> Gore, Bush Win in Colorado  </HEADLINE>
By WALTER R. MEARS, AP Special Correspondent
<TEXT>
<P>
   Al Gore and George W. Bush, already battling for the White House
as the nominees-to-be, began playing out the string of presidential
primaries with uncontested victories in Colorado on Friday. Utah
was voting, too, with the same outcome a certainty.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president and the Texas governor are past the campaign
for the Democratic and Republican nominations, and confronting each
other in a marathon struggle for the general election eight months
away.
</P>
<P>
   The national campaign is on, with 24 state primaries still to
come.
</P>
<P>
   The two Western primaries, along with Republican county
conventions plus a straw poll in Wyoming, are the remnants of a
failed attempt to gain clout for Rocky Mountain and Western states
in the nomination of presidents. Gov. Mike Leavitt of Utah tried to
engineer a nine-state combination, but couldn't.
</P>
<P>
   As the campaign turned out, it would have been too late anyhow,
with Republican challenger John McCain and Democrat Bill Bradley
both out of the race.
</P>
<P>
   In Colorado, Gore and Bush won predictable landslides, according
to exit polling of voters by Voter News Service.
</P>
<P>
   McCain and Bradley each stood to gain a handful of delegates
since they were awarded in proportion to the popular vote.
</P>
<P>
   So did minor candidate Alan Keyes, a black conservative who made
his mark in Republican campaign debates and said he will not quit
despite the certainty of a Bush ticket.
</P>
<P>
   Utah's Republican delegates all went to the winner, which would
mean 29 more for Bush.
</P>
<P>
   The Wyoming GOP conventions did not bind the 22 delegates there,
but there was no doubt they would be Bush's too.
</P>
<P>
   Bush went into Friday's primaries with 617 of the 1,034
delegates needed to win the nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Gore had 1,479; it takes 2,170 to install the Democratic
nominee.
</P>
<P>
   The primary outcome was forgone before a vote was cast.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Leavitt said it was worth the effort. ''The voice
of the West will be heard,'' the governor, a Bush man, said after
voting in Salt Lake City.
</P>
<P>
   Few seemed interested. At one Salt Lake City polling place, only
five people cast ballots during the first hour and 45 minutes.
''Nobody cares,'' said Clayton Hurst, an election judge.
</P>
<P>
   The western delegates push Bush and Gore closer to majorities by
which the national conventions will ratify the primaries that were
settled in only six weeks, when both men won overwhelmingly in the
16 contests of Super Tuesday. Gore swept, Bush won all but four GOP
contests, and both races were over.
</P>
<P>
   Bush and Gore were evenly matched in a CNN-Time poll released
Friday, Gore with the backing of 48 percent of registered voters
and Bush with 46 percent. The poll, taken after Tuesday's results,
also showed the two candidates closely matched on public perception
of their strengths as candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Exit polls from Colorado and Utah showed voters mostly satisfied
with a Bush-Gore matchup in November. Fewer than a fifth said they
would consider a third-party candidate. Voters were surveyed as
they left the polling places by Voter News Service, a consortium of
The Associated Press and television networks.
</P>
<P>
   In both states, conservatives made up two-thirds of the
Republican primary electorate -- a bigger share than in any other
GOP contest with exit polls this year except the Iowa caucuses.
</P>
<P>
   The exit poll showed Bush stronger on a question that had nagged
in the earlier primary states, with four out of five Colorado and
Utah voters saying he knows enough to serve effectively as
president. There was more skepticism among people who called
themselves independents, the bloc that had boosted McCain. About 30
percent expressed doubts on Bush's ability.
</P>
<P>
   Bush again ran strongest among Republicans, while about half the
self-styled independents in both primary states opted for McCain or
Keyes. Along with the delegates, the rest of the primary schedule
offers something of a framework for the national campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president was on the road all weekend, in New York,
Minneapolis, Chicago, Houston, Miami and Orlando, winding up at
home in Tennessee, one of next Tuesday's primary states. It is the
kind of road trip that usually waits until fall, but there was no
waiting in the 2000 campaign, with the party contests over early.
</P>
<P>
   Bush took a break at home in Austin before beginning a two-day
swing through the Southern states that vote next week. The biggest
of them are his own Texas, and Florida, where his brother, Jeb, is
governor. Both will be crucial to the Republican ticket in the Nov.
7 presidential election.
</P>
<P>
   A high-tech wrinkle added a bit of interest in Arizona on
Saturday. No doubt about the outcome, but for the first time,
Arizona Democrats had the option of voting over the Internet
beginning last Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   There are primaries to come in other major states that will be
keys to the general election, among them Illinois on March 21,
Pennsylvania on April 4 and New Jersey on June 6, the last day of
primary voting.

<HEADLINE> Report: SUNY hospitals are ran well but legislative mandate causingproblems  </HEADLINE>
By JESSE J. HOLLAND, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- Despite running a yearly shortfall, the
State University of New York's three teaching hospitals ''operate
more efficiently than 75 percent of their peer academic medical
centers,'' a nationally-recognized health care consulting firm said
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Although improvements in group purchasing, strategic planning
and consolidations could potentially save about $43 million
annually, in general the teaching hospitals in Stony Brook,
Syracuse and Brooklyn are in good shape businesswise, said
PricewaterhouseCoopers in its report to the SUNY administration.
</P>
<P>
   ''The report clearly demonstrates that SUNY's hospitals are
generally well managed,'' SUNY Chancellor Robert King said.
</P>
<P>
   But the teaching hospitals won't make money anytime soon, the
report warned.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is not anticipated that the financial results of the
hospitals will improve,'' the company said.
</P>
<P>
   And some of the suggestions PricewaterhouseCoopers offered,
including consolidation of some programs, could lead to some
personnel layoffs but nothing major, SUNY spokesman Jon Sorensen
said. ''The report points out how these are well run, well managed
places,'' he said. ''If they're well run, then it's suggested that
there's no fat.''
</P>
<P>
   The university system's teaching hospitals have been running a
shortfall in the past few years, which led SUNY to ask
PricewaterhouseCoopers to study the hospitals' operating systems.
</P>
<P>
   The problem has been traced to a legislative mandate for the
hospitals to transfer $116 million in state and federal funding to
the SUNY system every year. In the past, the three hospitals have
been able to meet the mandate. However, it is unlikely the
hospitals will be able to come up with all of the money this year
or anytime in the future because of higher costs and reduced
federal and state money, the report says.
</P>
<P>
   The teaching hospitals were only able to transfer $39 million
last year and had to borrow the rest. The hospitals have paid back
all but $20 million and that will be repaid by April, Sorensen
said.
</P>
<P>
   SUNY administrators have asked the Legislature in past years to
approve changes which could ease the hospitals' balance sheets,
including the negotiation of local labor contracts and making it
easier for the hospitals to borrow money. SUNY Chancellor Robert
King also has not ruled out asking the Legislature for additional
money in the state budget to take care of the shortfall.
</P>
<P>
   University officials told state legislators earlier this year
that they were waiting for PricewaterhouseCoopers to finish their
study before recommending any actions to address the shortfall. But
even with the changes suggested by the health care firms, the
university hospitals would still be in the red by at least $83
million a year.
</P>
<P>
   SUNY officials have said the shortfall will not force them to
raise tuition at the rest of the university system's campuses.
</P>
<P>
   PricewaterhouseCoopers was paid $1.1 million for the study.

<HEADLINE> Miller, Styron Meet Cuba Activist  </HEADLINE>
By ANITA SNOW, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   HAVANA (AP) -- American literary giants Arthur Miller and William
Styron met Friday with a leading Cuban human rights activist to
hear his views on civil liberties in the communist country and to
discuss simmering Cold War hostilities that keep their countries
apart.
</P>
<P>
   ''The most relevant thing about their visit was that it
signified human support for what we are doing here,'' Elizardo
Sanchez, president of the non-governmental Cuban Commission of
Human Rights and Reconciliation, told Associated Press Television
News.
</P>
<P>
   Sanchez said he gave Miller, Styron and other members of their
group his view of human rights in Cuba, including what he says is
an increase in politically motivated arrests.
</P>
<P>
   Sanchez, among Cuba's best known government opponents, said he
and his visitors agreed that a normalization of relations between
Havana and Washington could ultimately help ease the pressure the
government here places on its opponents.
</P>
<P>
   The Americans did not comment on their visit with Sanchez.
</P>
<P>
   However, earlier in the day, Miller told APTN during a stroll
through Old Havana that he thought an end to the four-decade U.S.
trade embargo against the island nation could help open Cuban
society.
</P>
<P>
   ''I do think it's time,'' said Miller. ''We would help them
regain their standing in the world and it could lead to a freer
society if we just didn't cut them off this way.''
</P>
<P>
   Styron expressed similar views, saying that he hoped the trade
embargo would be dropped in the next four or five years.
</P>
<P>
   During the trip, which began Wednesday, the writers are to meet
Foreign Minister Felipe Perez Roque and Ricardo Alarcon, president
of Cuba's National Assembly. They also are meeting with Cuban
writers, playwrights and actors before returning to the United
States on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday night they dined with Colombian writer and Nobel
laureate Gabriel Garcia Marquez.
</P>
<P>
   Miller was accompanied by his wife, photographer Inge Morath.
</P>
<P>
   The 85-year-old playwright is probably best known for the
Pulitzer-Prize winning ''Death of a Salesman'' and Tony-Award
winning ''The Crucible,'' which looked at anti-Communist witchhunts
in the United States during the Cold War.

<HEADLINE> Air Force Officer Found Guilty  </HEADLINE>
By BILL KACZOR, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   HURLBURT FIELD, Fla. (AP) -- An Air Force helicopter pilot
honored for leading a daring rescue off Iceland was found guilty at
a court-martial Friday of repeatedly molesting two underage girls.
</P>
<P>
   Col. James A. Sills, 48, was also found guilty of assaulting his
estranged wife, having an unprofessional relationship with his
secretary and lying during a security interview.
</P>
<P>
   He was sentenced to eight years in prison and dismissal from
service. He faced more than 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   Sills showed no emotion as the verdict was read. The 6-foot,
6-inch pilot, in his blue dress uniform with rows of decorations on
his chest, towered over a civilian and two Air Force defense
lawyers who stood alongside him.
</P>
<P>
   Sills was acclaimed for leading two helicopters through stormy
weather to rescue six seamen who had abandoned their ship off
Iceland in 1994. Sills and the other airmen were awarded the MacKay
Trophy for the year's most meritorious Air Force flight.
</P>
<P>
   One alleged victim testified during the two-week trial that
Sills groped and fondled her repeatedly over a 10-year period,
starting when she was 10. The girl, now 21, also alleged he once
had oral sex with her.
</P>
<P>
   Her allegations cover a period when Sills was stationed at Scott
Air Force Base, Ill.; Keflavik Naval Air Station, Iceland; and
Hurlburt Field, where he was a squadron commander.
</P>
<P>
   The second alleged victim, now 22, accused Sills of groping,
fondling and masturbating in front of her on boating trips in 1991,
when Sills was stationed in Illinois. She testified the first
alleged victim was present at the time.
</P>
<P>
   Defense lawyer Drew Pinkerton argued there were ''terrible,
terrible inconsistencies'' in the prosecution's case, based solely
on the women's accusations, which Sills denied.
</P>
<P>
   Sills said one of the girls twice kissed him when he didn't
expect it, once mashing her braces into his lips.

<HEADLINE> Bush Wins Support From GOP Faithful  </HEADLINE>
By JUDITH KOHLER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER (AP) -- George W. Bush swept nearly every voter group in
an overwhelmingly conservative Colorado Republican electorate on
Friday, although half of self-described independents preferred John
McCain, who's no longer running, or Alan Keyes, an exit poll found.
</P>
<P>
   Two-thirds of voters in Colorado's GOP presidential primary
called themselves conservative, a bigger share than in any other
GOP contest with exit polls this year except the Iowa caucuses.
Strong conservatives typically are reliable voters even in largely
uncontested elections like the Colorado and Utah primaries Friday.
</P>
<P>
   A third of Colorado GOP voters said they were part of the
religious right, a movement with a stronghold in Colorado Springs,
and six in 10 opposed abortion.
</P>
<P>
   Bush won voters across age, income and philosophical brackets in
Colorado, according to preliminary results of an exit poll by Voter
News Service for The Associated Press and television networks.
</P>
<P>
   ''Bush seems pretty sure of himself and what he wants to
accomplish,'' said Nancy Wright, 39, an office manager from
Englewood, Colo., and a Republican who voted for Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Four in five primary voters in the exit poll called themselves
Republican. The GOP primary was open to registered Republicans and
those unaffiliated with a party.
</P>
<P>
   Bush won half of self-described independents, a larger
proportion than in earlier primaries when majorities of
independents favored McCain, who ended his campaign on Thursday,
essentially conceding the nomination to Bush. In Colorado, a third
of independents backed McCain.
</P>
<P>
   Two-thirds of McCain voters said they would consider voting for
a third-party candidate in November rather than Bush or certain
Democratic nominee Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   A third of Colorado voters called moral values the most
important issue. In Utah, where nearly all GOP voters were Mormon,
half cited moral values as the top issue.
</P>
<P>
   Slightly more than half of Colorado GOP primary voters said gun
rights were more important than reducing gun violence -- a
polarizing issue in the state after last year's Columbine High
School massacre.
</P>
<P>
   The findings were from Voter News Service interviews with 461
Republican presidential primary voters in Colorado and 437 in Utah.
Results were subject to a margin of sampling error of plus or minus
6 percentage points, larger for subgroups. Because of low turnout,
exit poll samples in Democratic primaries in both states were too
small to be statistically reliable.

<HEADLINE> Investigators Hunt Child Abductor  </HEADLINE>
By VICKIE CHACHERE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, Fla. (AP) -- The mother of a 10-year-old girl who was
snatched from her driveway and held for three days thanked the
child's captor Friday for releasing her alive.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators said they are focusing their search for the
kidnapper in the area around where Jessica Rodriguez lives, based
on information from the girl. They said the girl was held in a
single-family home all three days, but declined to offer any
details about what happened to her during her captivity.
</P>
<P>
   Jessica had been abducted by a man Monday after getting off her
school bus outside her rural home in Trenton. On Thursday, she
walked into a Wal-Mart 25 miles away from home, asking for help.
Investigators said they believe the child was dropped off by her
captor.
</P>
<P>
   ''I want to tell the man who had Jessica, 'Thank you very much
for dropping her off safely,''' said her mother, Jennifer Graham,
mixing laughter and tears. ''And she's doing great. She's playing.
She's so happy. She's wonderful.''
</P>
<P>
   Investigators are focusing their search for the kidnapper in the
area around where the Jessica lives, based on information from the
girl. They would not divulge the information and declined to
comment about whether she had been assaulted.
</P>
<P>
   Jessica told investigators that she had never seen her abductor
before, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   ''She was able to give us a lot of details and is a very strong
and encouraging young witness,'' Sheriff David Turner said on ABC's
''Good Morning America.'' ''According to her, he was a stranger.
She did not know him by name. Or could not believe that she had
ever seen him previously.''
</P>
<P>
   The suspect was described as a balding man in his 30s, with a
thin face, and a tattoo of a heart with a broken arrow on his left
forearm. Police believe he is still driving the green Jeep Cherokee
Jessica's sisters described seeing on the day of the abduction.
</P>
<P>
   ''Somewhere out there is someone who fits this physical
description,'' said Ken Tucker, regional director for the Florida
Department of Law Enforcement. ''They are driving a green Jeep;
they probably haven't been at work this week. They probably have
been acting a little strange.''
</P>
<P>
   Authorities said the man may be in south Georgia and were asking
people there to look for someone matching his description.
</P>
<P>
   In the days after the girl vanished, her mother and aunts made
public pleas for her return as her uncles scoured the woods for the
girl.
</P>
<P>
   ''I want to thank everybody, I want to thank the media for
putting it all out there and bringing my daughter back home to me
because everybody has been a very big help,'' Graham told
reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Graham said she had talked to her children about stranger
abduction, telling them if it ever happened to them to stay focused
and aware of what was going on so they could help police later.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am very concerned about my children,'' Graham said. ''I want
the best for my kids and I still believe to this day that we live
in a very good place to raise children.''

<HEADLINE> 9 Army School Protesters Convicted  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLUMBUS, Ga. (AP) -- Nine people were convicted of tresspassing
Friday for their November protest against the Army's School of the
Americas.
</P>
<P>
   The nine, convicted during a non-jury trial, each face a maximum
of six months in federal prison and a $5,000 fine. They were
released pending pre-sentencing investigations of their
backgrounds, which will take a month or two.
</P>
<P>
   A tenth man charged with trespassing during the annual protest
in November, as well as another protest at the School of the
Americas Dec. 12, will have a non-jury trial Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The 10 were charged the day an estimated 12,000 people rallied
to protest the continued operation of the school at Fort Benning. A
few months after the 1997 protest, those on trial had all received
letters ordering them not to step foot on Fort Benning again for at
least five years.
</P>
<P>
   All are members of School of the Americas Watch, founded in 1990
by a Roman Catholic priest appalled by the murder of six Jesuit
priests in El Salvador that some believe was carried out by
graduates of the School of the Americas.

<P>
   CHARLESTON, S.C. (AP) -- Gertrude Sanford Legendre, a
conservationist known for her trips around the world to collect
plants and animals for the Smithsonian Institution and other
museums, died Wednesday. She was 97.
</P>
<P>
   Legendre, who chronicled her life in a 1987 autobiography, ''The
Time of My Life,'' brought home plant and animal specimens for
National Geographic, Yale University, Harvard's Peabody Museum and
others.
</P>
<P>
   On her 16th birthday she had the choice of making her coming out
as a debutante or going big-game hunting in Wyoming with her uncle.
She went hunting.
</P>
<P>
   She met her husband Sidney Legendre during a hunting trip to
Africa in the late 1920s. She worked for the Office of Strategic
Services in World War II and spent several months as a German
prisoner of war.
</P>
<P>
   After the war, Legendre organized efforts to provide medical
supplies and other relief to France and other countries. She also
built a school near her home for black children and supplied a hot
lunch each day.

   BERKELEY, Calif. (AP) -- Retired Alameda County Superior Court
Judge Raymond L. Marsh, who attracted national attention when he
banned prayer at a high school graduation ceremony, died Thursday
of cancer. He was 73.
</P>
<P>
   Marsh refused in 1983 to permit prayer at Granada High School in
Livermore, agreeing with student Leslie Ann Bennett's argument that
prayer violated the constitutionally mandated separation of church

<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Elaine Pedersen, who helped smash the
men-only barrier in long-distance running, died Monday from
complications of bone marrow cancer. She was 63.
</P>
<P>
   She began running in her late 20s. After being rejected several
times by the Boston Marathon because of her sex, she was one of a
handful of women finally accepted in 1972 to compete in the world's
most famous long-distance foot race.

quickly exhibited extraordinary skill.
</P>
<P>
   At 14, he played second on Canada's four-person chess team at

<HEADLINE> Iranians Said Indicted for Spying  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   GREAT FALLS, Mont. (AP) -- Eight Iranian Defense Ministry
officials are under federal indictment here on charges they tried
to obtain military secrets and smuggle them out of the country, a
Customs Service agent said.
</P>
<P>
   Special agent Brian Buschini said the indictments were handed up
in November 1996 and January 1997 and remain sealed.
</P>
<P>
   He told the Great Falls Tribune in an interview published Friday
that authorities decided to release some information to help locate
one of the eight who is known to travel extensively in the United
States and Europe. The Iranian officials have never been arrested.
</P>
<P>
   Customs Service spokesman Dennis Murphy in Washington and Johnny
Walker, resident agent in charge at the Customs Service office in
Great Falls, both declined comment on the Tribune report. Walker
said he would not allow Buschini to be interviewed again. The U.S.
attorney for Montana did not return telephone calls seeking
comment.
</P>
<P>
   When asked why an agent was allowed to talk one day and
prohibited the next, Walker replied: ''The situation has changed.
It's always touchy dealing with the press in law enforcement
situations.'' He would not elaborate.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Tribune, Buschini would not say what secrets
the Iranians allegedly tried to obtain, but said their success
would have significantly compromised U.S. military abilities in the
Middle East and enhanced the Iranian military.
</P>
<P>
   The Iranians were actively recruiting in the United States and
Canada to try to get the military items, Buschini said. One person
they contacted notified authorities.
</P>
<P>
   Buschini, who mostly investigated drug cases, worked undercover
posing as a corrupt import/export businessman. Agents were about to
arrest the Iranians, but they failed to show for one final meeting,
Buschini said.
</P>
<P>
   Those named in the indictment are a Gen. Manavi, a Col. Najafi,
Hassan Gholizadeh, Dawood Adabi-Harahani, Golamreza Mahrabdollahi,
Mohanois Assi, Haj Hamid Alami-Nia and Houshang Amir Bagheri.
</P>
<P>
   Buschini said the eight are charged with violating the Arms
Control Export Act, which carries a maximum penalty of 20 years in
prison. They also are charged with criminal conspiracy.
</P>
<P>
   It is Bagheri that the agency is seeking. Buschini said Fox TV
will air a segment on Bagheri on ''America's Most Wanted'' March
25, and Bagheri will join the Customs Service's 10 most wanted
list.

<HEADLINE> Dr. Laura Backs Off Gay Comments  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID BAUDER, AP Television Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Radio talk show host Laura Schlessinger, under
fire for referring to homosexuality as ''deviant'' behavior, said
Friday that she's sorry her comments have hurt some people.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, gay rights activists have started a campaign to
try to stop television stations from broadcasting Schlessinger's
''Dr. Laura'' talk show, which is scheduled to debut in September.
</P>
<P>
   On her popular radio show where she dispenses relationship
advice, Schlessinger has also referred to homosexuality as a
''biological error.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Regrettably, some of the words I've used have hurt some
people, and I am sorry for that,'' she said. ''Words that I have
used in a clinical context have been perceived as judgment. They
were not meant to characterize homosexual individuals or encourage
others to disparage homosexuals.
</P>
<P>
   ''I regularly remind my listeners that we are all made in God's
image and, therefore, we should treat one another with love and
kindness, irrespective of one's faith,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   She said she never intended to hurt anyone or contribute to an
atmosphere of hate or intolerance.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation,
Scott Seomin, said he had no comment on Schlessinger's statement.
</P>
<P>
   On her radio show, Schlessinger has likened a Web site set up to
criticize her comments, www.stopdrlaura.com, to fascism.
</P>
<P>
   Paramount Television Group, which is syndicating the ''Dr.
Laura'' show, issued its own statement saying it is committed to
presenting society's issues without creating or contributing to an
atmosphere of hate or hurt.
</P>
<P>
   Paramount said Schlessinger's upcoming show ''is planned to
include multiple points of view, derived from a variety of sources,
guest and a studio audience.''

<HEADLINE> Tobacco Case Gag Order Decried  </HEADLINE>
By CATHERINE WILSON, AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- Five major publishing companies filed a federal
lawsuit Friday seeking to lift a gag order imposed by a state judge
on lawyers in a smokers' trial threatening to produce a
record-setting damage award against the tobacco industry.
</P>
<P>
   The media companies want to be able to talk to attorneys
handling ''one of the largest, most important and newsworthy
trials'' in U.S. history, according to the lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our view is the judge went way beyond what is necessary or
appropriate under the circumstances,'' media attorney Sanford
Bohrer said.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides are barred from commenting on the case outside court.
The tobacco industry lost a state court appeal challenging the gag
order this month.
</P>
<P>
   Publishers of USA Today, The Wall Street Journal, The New York
Times, The Miami Herald, the Tampa Tribune and the Richmond
Times-Dispatch of Virginia want a federal order dissolving the gag
order before jurors decide the next phase of the case: compensatory
damages for three smokers.
</P>
<P>
   Without anyone asking for the gag order, Circuit Judge Robert
Kaye imposed one on the attorneys and their clients in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The tobacco industry fears an estimated 500,000 sick Florida
smokers may win a $300 billion verdict. The jury hearing the case
has already decided the industry conspired to produce a dangerous
and defective product.
</P>
<P>
   Closing arguments in the compensatory damages phase of the case
are scheduled to begin March 20.
</P>
<P>
   The potential award ''raises the question of whether the tobacco
industry will remain solvent and in a position to pay the billions
of dollars promised to the states,'' the lawsuit said. As long as
the gag order stays in place, ''one of the most important business
cases in our nation's history will always carry the shroud of
secrecy.''
</P>
<P>
   The defendants in the smokers' case are: Philip Morris Inc.,
R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co., Brown &AMP; Williamson Tobacco Corp.,
Lorillard Tobacco Co., Liggett Group Inc., the Council for Tobacco
Research and the Tobacco Institute.

<HEADLINE> Detectives Search for Dog Killer  </HEADLINE>
By RON HARRIS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) -- Police have assembled a photo gallery of
suspects and spent hours working up a sketch of the man who reached
into a woman's car, snatched her dog from her lap and threw him
into oncoming traffic in a case of road rage.
</P>
<P>
   And people throughout the nation have donated more reward money
to help find the bichon frise's killer than they have to solve
high-profile missing children's cases in Northern California.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're a little bit surprised,'' said San Jose police spokesman
Steve Dixon. ''Clues are being sent in. People are calling in
license plate numbers.''
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses said the suspect was upset after the car driven by the
dog's owner, Sara McBurnett, bumped his from behind on Feb. 11. The
10-year-old dog, Leo, later died at a veterinary hospital.
</P>
<P>
   McBurnett worked with a sketch artist to come up with the
composite of the suspect, which police are expected to release next
week. He was described as a white man between the ages of 20 and 28
with a goatee. He was driving a dark Ford Explorer or Expedition
with Virginia license plates.
</P>
<P>
   The suspect could face felony animal cruelty charges and as many
as three years in jail.
</P>
<P>
   The Police Department has one lead investigator and an assistant
working on the case. The department has not been this involved in
an animal cruelty case since a spate of cat killings in San Jose
last year, Dixon said.
</P>
<P>
   McBurnett said she tapped the man's vehicle after he cut her off
in heavy traffic near the San Jose airport. When confronted by the
driver, McBurnett said, she rolled down her window to apologize.
</P>
<P>
   That's when the suspect snatched Leo and fled.
</P>
<P>
   McBurnett, a real estate agent who lives in Incline Village,
Nev., and is visiting the San Francisco Bay area, got help in her
quest for justice from local radio talk show host Ronn Owens, who
announced he had ponied up $500 for the arrest of the man
responsible for little Leo's death.
</P>
<P>
   Owens owns a bichon frise and has devoted about three hours
during the past week discussing the incident on his program.
</P>
<P>
   ''This one just happened to get to me,'' Owens said Thursday.
''It's the road rage. It's the sheer cruelty. It's the abject
sadism involved.''
</P>
<P>
   The Santa Clara Valley Humane Society says the reward fund for
the arrest and conviction of the suspect has now reached about
$40,000 from people concerned about the case, with an additional
$10,000 pledged.
</P>
<P>
   ''When humans are injured or murdered, the public expects the
police to put all forces forward to solve the case. Animal abuse
cases don't get that kind of attention,'' said Marcia Mayeda of the
humane society. ''There's been an outpouring because people really
want to see this person caught.''

<HEADLINE> Group Urges Rubens Painting Probe  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Adding to the growing volume of art believed to
have been pilfered by the Nazis during World War II, a Jewish group
has called on the Metropolitan Museum of Art to take a closer look
at the history of a Peter Paul Rubens' painting.
</P>
<P>
   ''Portrait of a Man,'' acquired by the museum in 1982, is worth
millions, but its provenance is marred: it once passed through the
hands of an alleged Nazi art dealer, according to Elan Steinberg,
executive director of the World Jewish Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Steinberg said Friday he believes the 1597 portrait by the
Flemish master may have been stolen from Jews. ''The Nazi plunder
of art has touched home right here in America,'' Steinberg said
Associated Press Television News.
</P>
<P>
   ''In the case of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, there is a
painting by that great artist Peter Paul Rubens, which passed
through the hands of one Karl Haberstock. Haberstock was one of the
three or four notorious Nazi dealers.''
</P>
<P>
   Steinberg said it's possible the piece was returned to its
rightful owner after the war, and subsequently found its way to the
museum via a legitimate path. But he wants the museum to admit the
portrait's history is suspicious.
</P>
<P>
   ''The issue is whether American museums will fulfill the pledge
they made two years ago,'' Steinberg said, referring to a 1998
statement by the Association of Art Museum Directors urging museums
to check their collections for pieces that may have been stolen or
sold under duress during World War II.
</P>
<P>
   Harold Holzer, spokesman for the Metropolitan Museum, said the
institution is currently reviewing its 2 million pieces.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Met is engaged in this overarching survey of its
collections to determine whether there are any pictures whose
provenance has questions or holes in it during the period 1933 to
1945,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think we're going to discuss picture by picture, but
obviously that's one of the pictures we're looking at and we're
going to be reporting on,'' he said of the Rubens.

<HEADLINE> Canadiens 3, Sabres 2  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN WAWROW, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) -- Brian Savage swatted a puck out of the air
to score midway through the third period and give the Montreal
Canadiens their third straight victory, a 3-2 defeat of the
revamped Buffalo Sabres on Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   Craig Darby and Trevor Linden had Montreal's other goals, while
goalie Jeff Hackett made 29 stops as the Canadiens moved up to
seventh place in the Eastern Conference.
</P>
<P>
   Sergei Zholtok set up two goals for Montreal, which beat Buffalo
for the fourth consecutive time.
</P>
<P>
   Jason Woolley and Maxim Afinogenov scored for the Sabres, who
swung two trades earlier in the day, acquiring Doug Gilmour and
prospect J.P. Dumont from Chicago and adding Chris Gratton in a
four-player, two-draft-pick deal with Tampa Bay.
</P>
<P>
   Gilmour did not dress, still nursing bruised ribs that forced
him to miss Chicago's last four games.
</P>
<P>
   Gratton did play, assisting on Afinogenov's goal and slamming a
shot off the post five minutes into the third period, just missing
a chance to break a 2-2 tie.
</P>
<P>
   The Sabres, 2-5-1 in their last eight games, failed to help
their playoff cause and fell three points behind the eighth-place
New York Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   Despite being outshot 28-12 through the first 45 minutes of the
game, the Canadiens never trailed and went ahead for good on
Savage's brilliant play.
</P>
<P>
   Patrice Brisbois helped create the goal by blasting a shot from
close range. Sabres goalie Dominik Hasek made the stop but couldn't
control the rebound, which bounced in front of him. Savage, falling
after being pushed from behind by Woolley, batted the loose puck
behind Hasek with 10:20 remaining.
</P>
<P>
   Linden chipped in Zholtok's pass to give the Canadiens a 2-1
lead 12:30 into the second period, but the Sabres tied it three
minutes later on Afinogenov's power-play goal.
</P>
<P>
   Gratton set up that goal when he blasted a shot that went
through Hackett's legs and off the post. The puck deflected
directly to Afinogenov, who stuffed it in the open side.
</P>
<P>
   Darby opened the scoring 11:07 into the game, and the Sabres
replied on Woolley's second goal in two games, five minutes into
the second period.
</P>
<P>
   Gilmour received red-carpet treatment from the Sabres.
</P>
<P>
   After flying in from Fort Lauderdale on Sabres owner John Rigas'
company jet, Gilmour got a police escort from the Buffalo-Niagara
International Airport to the downtown arena, arriving about an hour
before game time.
</P>
<P>
   Along with missing captain Michael Peca (dislocated shoulder)
and Geoff Sanderson (knee sprain), the Sabres were also missing
defenseman Alexei Zhitnik, listed day-to-day with a broken finger.
</P>
<P>
   Christian Laflamme, acquired in Thursday's four-player deal with
Edmonton, made his Canadiens debut.

<HEADLINE> Caribbean Leaders Urge Tax Haven Aid  </HEADLINE>
By MICHELLE FAUL, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   POINTE-A-PITRE, Guadeloupe (AP) -- Caribbean leaders meeting
Friday at the first Franco-Caribbean summit looked to French
President Jacques Chirac to halt an assault on their offshore tax
havens and their trade with Europe.
</P>
<P>
   ''The reality is that we are under siege,'' Premier Lester Bird
of Antigua and Barbuda said.
</P>
<P>
   He complained of a two-pronged attack on the offshore industry,
with the Paris-based Organization for Economic Cooperation and
Development concerned about the flight of capital to tax havens,
and the United States planning new anti-money laundering
legislation.
</P>
<P>
   The leaders say they're concerned that new laws could affect
people with legitimate funds in offshore accounts.
</P>
<P>
   It's unwelcome scrutiny in the Caribbean, where fragile
economies are battered by falling agriculture prices, flat tourism
and increasing drug-related crime.
</P>
<P>
   Leaders from 14 of the 15 countries in the Cariforum trade bloc
attended the one-day meeting. Their agenda included discussion of
drug smuggling, illegal immigration and debt relief. The leaders
also complained about shipments through the Caribbean of nuclear
fuel from France to Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Chirac, whose nation is to take over the European Union
presidency this summer, met with Jamaican Premier P.J. Patterson,
the Cariforum president.
</P>
<P>
   Patterson said leaders asked Chirac to halt the publication in
July of an OECD document condemning tax havens. The 29-member OECD
last year threatened sanctions against countries perceived as
places to escape taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Patterson said, Chirac proposed ''meaningful
consultations'' to study the results of the document.
</P>
<P>
   Patterson said the Caribbean states were ready to work with
developed countries to fight tax evaders, but also emphasized that
offshore jurisdictions sheltering legitimate money under the laws
of their countries should not be harassed.
</P>
<P>
   The summit also concentrated on threats to an aid and trade pact
reached in Brussels, Belgium, last month that replaces the
25-year-old preferential trade program for former European colonies
in Africa, the Pacific and the Caribbean.
</P>
<P>
   Under the new pact -- which Patterson said some EU countries want
to weaken -- the Europeans would pay $13.8 billion in aid over the
next five years. It also brings trade in line with World Trade
Organization rules, resolving U.S. complaints, especially over
Europe's preferential import of Caribbean bananas.
</P>
<P>
   Anxiety about the banana trade has led to the collapse of the
industry on some islands.

<HEADLINE> Warnings Alleged in White House Case  </HEADLINE>
By PETE YOST, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- In court papers unsealed Friday, a former
White House contractor says she was warned not to reveal a problem
with the White House e-mail system that concealed thousands of
messages from the Justice Department and congressional
investigators.
</P>
<P>
   The contractor, Betty Lambuth, says a subordinate told her some
of the e-mails deal with ''Vice President Al Gore's involvement in
campaign fund-raising controversies'' and ''the sale of Clinton
Commerce Department trade mission seats in exchange for campaign
contributions.'' The subordinate said the e-mail also contained
information on the White House's improper gathering of FBI
background files of long-ago Republican appointees and the Monica
Lewinsky scandal, Lambuth stated in her declaration.
</P>
<P>
   The document was unsealed by U.S. District Judge Royce Lamberth.
</P>
<P>
   Lambuth says she learned of a problem with the White House
e-mail system in May 1998 in the midst of Independent Counsel
Kenneth Starr's perjury and obstruction probe of the president in
the Lewinsky scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Asked to comment Friday, the office of Starr's successor,
Independent Counsel Robert Ray, said, ''We are aware of the
allegations regarding the e-mail issue, and we are taking
appropriate steps with regard to those allegations.
</P>
<P>
   ''Beyond that we can't comment,'' said Neille Mallon Russell, a
spokeswoman for Ray's office.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the e-mail problem, which began in August 1996 in the
midst of the Clinton-Gore re-election campaign, ''a significant
number of e-mails were ... not being searched in response to
subpoenas and document requests,'' Lambuth said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I learned that one of the computer e-mail servers, which
housed incoming e-mail to much of the Clinton White House staff,
approximately 500 individuals, was not being ... managed'' by the
automated records system. The system allows text to be searched in
response ''to subpoenas and other inquiries,'' said Lambuth, who
said the problem stemmed from ''an apparent programming error.''
</P>
<P>
   After Lambuth informed the White House, Office of Administration
counsel Mark Lindsay told her ''that if I or any of my team who
knew about the e-mail problem told anyone else about it we would
lose our jobs, be arrested and put in jail,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   She said Lindsay specified that she was not to tell even her
private-sector boss, Steve Hawkins, who she said eventually removed
her from her White House assignment when she refused to tell him
about the e-mail problem.
</P>
<P>
   Lambuth said she and her co-workers dubbed the e-mail problem
''Project X,'' and because of the threats, she and her staff took
to meeting in a park close to the New Executive Office Building and
in a nearby Starbucks when discussing the matter.
</P>
<P>
   Lambuth, who left the White House in July 1998, said she still
works for CEXEC, a subcontractor for Northrop-Grumman that helps
run and maintain the White House computer system.
</P>
<P>
   ''Lindsay and others on the Clinton White House staff who knew
why I wasn't telling Hawkins about the e-mail problem never
intervened with Hawkins to protect my job,'' Lambuth said in the
declaration.
</P>
<P>
   The White House declined to comment on the declaration from
Lambuth Friday night. White House spokesman Jim Kennedy said, ''We
are actively in the process of fully reviewing all these matters
and will be reporting on them next week as the president's counsel
has said.''
</P>
<P>
   Lambuth's declaration was released in a lawsuit on the FBI files
controversy filed by a conservative group, Judicial Watch.
</P>
<P>
   The e-mail problem was publicly revealed last month by a former
White House employee, Sheryl Hall, who alleged in a declaration
that ''when the contractors told the White House about the problem,
they were threatened, warned not to discuss it. They were told the
documents were classified.''
</P>
<P>
   At a hearing Friday morning, the judge also unsealed a new
declaration by Hall in which she said the White House plans to get
rid of computer-taped archives and the contents of computer hard
drives of presidential aides who leave.
</P>
<P>
   A career staff member in the White House Office of
Administration ''told me that ... the Clinton-Gore White House
plans to destroy ... archival cartridge tapes'' and to ''reformat
the hard drives'' of departing White House staffers.
</P>
<P>
   Hall said there are archives cartridges for at least 500
departing staffers.
</P>
<P>
   Lamberth ordered Justice Department lawyer James Gilligan,
representing the White House in the case, to ensure that no hard
drives are reformatted and no cartridges destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, ''I want names of those responsible for
preserving'' the material, said Lamberth. Gilligan provided the
names of the White House custodians at a late-afternoon hearing in
the case attended by both Lambuth and Hall.

   COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) -- A bomber blew himself up, killing at least 20
other people and wounding 64 on a busy street in Sri Lanka's capital Friday, but
he apparently missed his target -- a motorcade of Cabinet ministers. Authorities
quickly searched for accomplices, a hunt that continued into Saturday as
hundreds of police and anti-terrorist commandoes cordoned off parts of the city.
Police said that jackets laden with explosives and two rocket-propelled grenades
were found in the area. Military officials blamed Tamil separatists for the
blast.

additional withdrawal from the West Bank, Yasser Abed Rabbo said after a meeting

<HEADLINE> Activist Faces Court in Cairo  </HEADLINE>
By MAE GHALWASH, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) -- A leading Egyptian human rights activist
returned home Friday to face charges of illegally accepting a
donation from a foreign country, a charge punishable by up to 15
years in jail.
</P>
<P>
   Hafez Abu Saada, the secretary-general of The Egyptian
Organization for Human Rights, beamed as his wife and 5-year-old
son hugged him at the Cairo airport after he arrived from France.
Human rights activists, including representatives from Amnesty
International, also greeted him.
</P>
<P>
   The case against Abu Saada has drawn condemnation from local and
international human rights groups and has embarrassed the
government.
</P>
<P>
   Abu Saada was arrested in 1998 on allegations that the group
accepted the money in return for publishing a false report. The
report accused police of arresting and torturing hundreds of Coptic
Christians during a murder investigation in a southern Egyptian
village in August 1998. The government denied any abuse.
</P>
<P>
   The $25,000 donation was from the British Embassy. Both Abu
Saada's group and Britain say it was for a project concerning legal
aid to Egyptian women.
</P>
<P>
   At the airport, Abu Saada told reporters that the government
should not be misled by false accusations against human rights
activists, particularly if investigations proved them wrong.
</P>
<P>
   He had earlier said that he would not return home unless charges
against him were dropped or if his case was referred to a civilian
court. It was unclear why he chose to return even though his
demands were not met.

<HEADLINE> No. 21 UConn 70, Georgetown 55  </HEADLINE>
By HAL BOCK, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- The bounce is back in Connecticut's step, and
the Huskies, who rarely have looked like defending national
champions this season, are strutting through the Big East
tournament.
</P>
<P>
   UConn earned a shot at an unprecedented third straight
conference tournament championship and fourth in five years Friday
night, pulling away in the final 10 minutes to defeat Georgetown
70-55.
</P>
<P>
   The No. 21 Huskies, defending national champions but seeded just
fourth in this tournament after an in-and-out regular season, are
the first team in the 21-year history of the league to reach the
title game after playing on the tournament's opening day.
</P>
<P>
   ''We know in the month of March is when we really have to win,''
point guard Khalid El-Amin said. ''We're ready. Our confidence is
up.''
</P>
<P>
   El-Amin, who scored 30 points the day before against Seton Hall,
had just 11 against Georgetown, but had six assists.
</P>
<P>
   ''Yesterday, I was a scorer,'' he said. ''Tonight, I was a point
guard. You have to know which night you play which role.''
</P>
<P>
   The scorers Friday were Albert Mouring and Kevin Freeman, who
led UConn with 16 apiece. It was consecutive 3-point baskets by
Mouring that touched off a 10-0 run in the final 10 minutes and
pulled the Huskies out of reach.
</P>
<P>
   ''The first 30 minutes, it was up and down the court for both
teams,'' Connecticut coach Jim Calhoun said. ''Then we decided to
play some defense and made some good stops.''
</P>
<P>
   UConn's defense shut out Georgetown for nearly eight minutes,
and by the time the Hoyas scored again on a 3-pointer by Lee
Scruggs, who had a career-high 27 points, the Huskies had the game
under control.
</P>
<P>
   Mouring and El-Amin made six straight free throws in the final
minutes to seal the victory for Connecticut (24-8), which posted
its ninth straight Big East tournament victory, a record.
</P>
<P>
   It was the third solid tournament game in three nights for
Mouring, who had 12 and 11 in UConn's first two victories.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think he has a terrific feel of what I call dagger points,''
Calhoun said. ''He knows what dagger points are, and I think he's a
terrific, terrific shooter. He seems to have the moment.''
</P>
<P>
   Mouring and Freeman compensated for a subpar game by Jake
Voskuhl, who managed just two points in 22 minutes. Ajou Deng was
UConn's other double-figure scorer with 10 as the Huskies won their
sixth straight game.
</P>
<P>
   Scruggs, who pulled down 10 rebounds, scored 18 points in the
first half as Georgetown gave Connecticut all it could handle. The
Hoyas (18-14) led by as many as eight points early, but a
five-point possession by Connecticut gave the Huskies a big boost.
</P>
<P>
   After Doug Wrenn dunked to put Connecticut in front 27-25,
Georgetown coach Craig Eserick was charged with a technical.
Mouring converted one of two free throws, and Connecticut retained
possession and got another basket from Freeman for a 30-25 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Georgetown managed to tie it 33-33, but Mouring scored the final
basket of the half, and the Huskies led 35-33 at halftime.

<HEADLINE> Pacers 95, Cavaliers 92  </HEADLINE>
By TOM WITHERS, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND (AP) -- Reggie Miller scored 21 of his 28 points in the
second half and made three huge free throws with 42.3 seconds
remaining Friday night, leading the Indiana Pacers to a 95-92 win
over the Cleveland Cavaliers.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Jackson made a short hook in the lane with 8.7 seconds left
as the Pacers, coming off a draining overtime win against Portland
on Thursday, held on for their fourth straight win.
</P>
<P>
   Cleveland had two chances to tie in the closing seconds, but
both Andre Miller and Shawn Kemp were way off the mark on
3-pointers.
</P>
<P>
   Indiana was without Jalen Rose (flu) and Chris Mullin (pulled
calf muscle) and had a much tougher time with the Cavs, whom they
pummeled by 48 points in December. Rik Smits had 17 points for the
Pacers.
</P>
<P>
   Lamond Murray led Cleveland with 25 points and Miller had 17 and
matched a season-high with 14 assists.
</P>
<P>
   Kemp, who was named to the Cavs' all-time starting five as part
of the franchise's 30th anniversary, had a rough night. He finished
with 11 points on just 5-of-17 shooting and spent part of the
fourth quarter on the bench in foul trouble. He and Smits nearly
squared off in the final period after getting tangled and both got
hit with technicals.
</P>
<P>
   With the Cavs leading 91-90, Reggie Miller was fouled by Wesley
Person while attempting a 3-pointer in front of the Cleveland
bench. The contact came after Miller released his shot, and the
call was a little late, but the officials didn't let Person get
away with flattening Miller.
</P>
<P>
   His three free throws made it 93-91 before Kemp was fouled on a
drive with 29.3 seconds remaining. But with a chance to tie it and
atone for another off-night, Kemp was long with his first free
throw. He made the second to bring the Cavs within 93-92.
</P>
<P>
   On Indiana's next trip, Jackson backed Andre Miller down the
lane and dropped in his short hook to put the Pacers up three.
</P>
<P>
   Andre Miller then badly missed a 3-pointer from the top of the
key with four second left, and the ball bounced all the way back
out to Kemp, who misfired just before the horn.
</P>
<P>
   Jonathan Bender made his first career start for Indiana as
Mullin and Rose were unavailable.
</P>
<P>
   Miller and Smits combined to score 24 of Indiana's 26 points in
the third as the Pacers took a 72-70 lead.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Kemp, criticized for his conditioning this season, received
a warm ovation from the Gund Arena crowd during halftime ceremonies
honoring the Cavs' all-time team. ... Indiana coach Larry Bird
thinks the NBA might be reaching with its attempt to lure fans back
by having microphones in team huddles and TV cameras in the locker
room at halftime. ''They forget the game is played on the court and
not in the locker room,'' Bird said. The league has promised to
fine teams $100,000 if coaches don't comply. ''I don't like it, but
I'll have to deal with it,'' Bird said. ... The Pacers' 136-88 win
over the Cavs in December was the second largest in team history
and the worst loss in Cleveland history.

<HEADLINE> Police Hire Ex-Olympic Guard Jewell  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   JEFFERSON, Ga. (AP) -- Richard Jewell, the former Centennial
Olympic Park security guard who became a target of a bombing
investigation during the 1996 Summer Games, has been hired by the
Jefferson Police Department as a policeman.
</P>
<P>
   Jewell, who was cleared of the bombing three months later,
started work Feb. 24, and is going through the department's
standard training program, Chief Darren Glenn said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Jewell will be assigned to the department's patrol unit, and is
expected to begin patrolling after the six-week training program
ends, Glenn told the Athens Daily News/Banner-Herald for a Saturday
story.
</P>
<P>
   Jefferson is a city of about 3,300 people about 50 miles
northeast of Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Jewell was hailed as a hero for helping clear people away from a
bomb before it exploded in the park July 27, 1996, killing one
person and injuring more than 100. But three days later, he became
the focus of an FBI investigation.
</P>
<P>
   In October 1996, the Justice Department cleared Jewell. That
exoneration played into Glenn's decision to hire Jewell.
</P>
<P>
   ''When you're accused of something and you're innocent, you
shouldn't have to pay for it for the rest of your life,'' Glenn
said.

<HEADLINE> Mudslide Destroys Five Calif. Homes  </HEADLINE>
By ANNE M. PETERSON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   MILLBRAE, Calif. (AP) -- The Delgado family home leaned at a
45-degree angle Friday, its foundation ripped away by a slow-motion
disaster -- a football field-size mudslide that also endangers seven
other houses.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've gone through all of the emotions: denial, sadness,
grief,'' Maria Delgado, 45, said Friday as she stood across the
street, unable to get any closer to her disintegrating
half-million-dollar house. ''But now we're just angry. We want to
know what happens now.''
</P>
<P>
   The Delgados and four other families evacuated Tuesday as the
rain-weakened hillside slid toward their homes in this suburb south
of San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   The slide buckled one foundation, punched a tree through the
garage wall of another home and sent a wall of mud into the bedroom
of a third. Firefighters used poles and guns to break windows, to
prevent the glass from exploding outward.
</P>
<P>
   Residents of three houses at the top of the unstable hill were
told to stay out of their backyards and warned they might have to
leave at a moment's notice. Heavy rains have caused several
landslides recently in the San Francisco Bay area.
</P>
<P>
   Millbrae has appealed to state and federal officials for aid for
the families, since homeowner's insurance policies sometimes don't
cover natural disasters. The city also declared a state of
emergency and has authorized spending about $100,000 on temporary
repairs on the hill.
</P>
<P>
   The City Council on Friday decided to let the five homes stand
for now, partly because they were holding back the slide from the
rest of the street. The Delgado house, however, would eventually be
demolished. The other homes were still salvageable.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco had its rainiest February in history, and several
storms over the last two weeks sent the hillside falling about 50
feet.
</P>
<P>
   Two days of dry weather slowed the slide to a crawl Friday, and
although there was a slight chance of rain Friday night, fair skies
were forecast for the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ''If we get a couple of dry days maybe that will solidify it,''
said Tom Coletti, Millbrae's superintendent of public works. ''We
don't know what nature's going to do here. It's unpredictable.''
</P>
<P>
   Francis Gadayan was helping his father-in-law move Friday under
sunny skies. ''The house is still intact,'' Gadayan said. ''We're
just getting everything out just in case.''
</P>
<P>
   In Daly City, six miles south of San Francisco, a crumbling
bluff overlooking the Pacific Ocean was threatening to destroy 18
homes. Many of the residents there have already left, their gas
supply cut off because of the danger.
</P>
<P>
   Across the San Francisco Bay in Oakland, one hillside house
stood yellow-tagged because of the danger of a landslide.

<HEADLINE> Md. Woman Arrested in Shooting  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ESSEX, Md. (AP) -- A woman lied to gun shop owners to buy the
weapons used by a man who allegedly killed four people and
kidnapped his girlfriend, federal officials said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Constance Waugh, 48, was arrested at her home and charged with
lying on a federal form.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators said Joseph Palczynski, 31, accompanied Waugh, a
neighbor, to two gun shops where she falsely told dealers the
weapons were for her. She purchased a shotgun and an AR-15 assault
weapon, federal authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   If convicted, Waugh faces up to 10 years in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Waugh said Palczynski told her he couldn't buy the weapons
because of his criminal record but wanted to use them for target
shooting, said Mike Campbell, a spokesman for the Bureau of
Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms.
</P>
<P>
   Palczynski has been on the run since Tuesday night, when police
say he shot and killed three people while abducting his estranged
girlfriend, Tracy Whitehead, from an apartment complex east of
Baltimore. Police say he is responsible for a fourth shooting death
Wednesday as he tried to steal a car. Whitehead escaped Wednesday
night.
</P>
<P>
   Officers recovered two guns and the stolen car he was driving.
</P>
<P>
   The manhunt for Palczynski was expanded Friday to extreme
southern Harford County because of unconfirmed reports he was in
the area, police said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Palczynski's mother left a message on her home
answering machine pleading with him to turn himself in.
</P>
<P>
   ''Joseph, this is Mom,'' Patricia Long says on the tape. ''This
is hurting all of us.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Please, I don't know what to say anymore, and I don't want you
killed. I know you said you'd kill yourself before you'd go back,
and if you got to do it, then do it,'' the tearful voice says,
before abruptly breaking off.

<HEADLINE> Heat 96, Nuggets 88  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- Alonzo Mourning had 28 points, 10 rebounds and six
blocked shots Friday night, leading the Miami Heat to a 96-88
victory over Denver, extending their home winning streak to 11
games.
</P>
<P>
   The Heat have defeated the Nuggets nine straight games and
haven't lost to Denver since a 100-98 loss on March 3, 1995, at
McNichols Arena.
</P>
<P>
   Keon Clark scored 28 points on 12-of-17 shooting, and Antonio
McDyess had 19 points for the Nuggets, who have lost four in a row
and six of seven.
</P>
<P>
   P.J. Brown, who scored 16 of his 18 points in the second half,
scored four points during an 11-2 run that gave the Heat a 90-81
lead with 6:26 left.
</P>
<P>
   Clark's dunk and James Posey's free throw drew Denver within
five, but Jamal Mashburn, who scored 23 points, responded with a
3-pointer to give Miami a 96-88 lead with 2:36 remaining.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, Denver's 27-10 run, capped by Clark's dunk and ensuing
free throw, tied the score 77-77 with 10:10 remaining.
</P>
<P>
   With Mourning out with foul trouble, Clark's 12 third-quarter
points keyed a Nuggets spurt that cut Miami's 17-point lead to
70-65 heading into the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Nick Van Exel, who averages just under 16 points, was held to
three points on 1-of-11 shooting, but he had 13 assists. Denver was
17-of-29 from the free-throw line and 1-of-9 from 3-point range.
</P>
<P>
   Mourning hit four free throws and Mark Strickland dunked off an
alley-oop pass from Tim Hardaway to key an 8-3 run that gave Miami
a 55-46 lead at halftime.
</P>
<P>
   Mourning scored 23 points and had five blocked shots in the
first half, while McDyess kept Denver close with 15 points.
</P>
<P>
NOTES: The Heat activated forward-center Otis Thorpe and placed
center Duane Causwell on the injured list with a sprained right
thumb. Thorpe missed the last seven games with a sore knee. ...
Heat forward Clarence Weatherspoon, who has three double-doubles in
his past five games, sat out with a bone contusion of the right
knee, sustained in practice Thursday. Strickland, playing many of
Weatherspoon's minutes, scored 13 to tie a season high. ... Denver
swingman Tariq Abdul-Wahad missed his third straight game with a
sprained left wrist. ... Miami's longest home winning streak is 12
straight, achieved during the 1992-93 season. ... Denver leads the
league in blocked shots, but Miami finished with nine to the
Nuggets' none

<HEADLINE> Marino To Announce Retirement Monday  </HEADLINE>
By STEVEN WINE, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAVIE, Fla. (AP) -- Dan Marino decided 420 touchdown passes are
enough.
</P>
<P>
   The most prolific passer in NFL history will announce his
retirement Monday, ending a 17-year career with the Miami Dolphins,
a source close to Marino said Friday, speaking on condition of
anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   Marino, 38, badly wanted to go out like John Elway and retire as
a Super Bowl champion. But after parting ways with the Dolphins,
Marino reluctantly rejected an offer to play this year for the
Minnesota Vikings.
</P>
<P>
   Minnesota coach Dennis Green, in Tampa for a meeting of the NFL
competition committee, said Marino called him Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ''He informed me that he plans to announce his retirement, and I
wished him the best of luck,'' Green said. ''I still think he has
the ability to play, but he made the decision based on what he
thought was right, and I respect him for that.''
</P>
<P>
   Friends said Marino turned the deal down because of his bad
knees, his loyalty to the Dolphins and his unwillingness to be
separated from his wife and five children for an extended time.
</P>
<P>
   The Dolphins confirmed a news conference for Marino is scheduled
Monday. They declined further comment.
</P>
<P>
   Marino, who hasn't spoken publicly in nearly three weeks, played
golf Friday in a private charity event held by Greg Norman in Hobe
Sound, Fla. Word of his decision to retire spread Thursday night
while Marino was attending a Bruce Springsteen concert with his
possible successor, Dolphins quarterback Damon Huard.
</P>
<P>
   ''To think that No. 13 won't be in that uniform, it's a sad
day,'' said Miami sportscaster Joe Rose, who caught Marino's first
touchdown pass in 1983. ''I'm guilty like everybody else of
thinking, 'One more year, one more year.' You don't want the magic
to stop.''
</P>
<P>
   Receiver Lamar Thomas said the Dolphins will miss Marino.
</P>
<P>
   ''We all look up to him,'' Thomas said. ''I'm kind of shocked. I
was hoping he'd play another year. It sent chills up my spine
playing with him, he's such a competitor.''
</P>
<P>
   Marino's place in history will be the subject of endless
debates. Some of his records could last for decades, including NFL
career marks for touchdowns, yardage (61,361) and completions
(4,967).
</P>
<P>
   Yet Marino never won a Super Bowl. So where does he rank among
quarterbacks?
</P>
<P>
   ''He should be No. 1, because he's got all the passing
records,'' said Don Shula, his coach for 13 years. ''Sure he would
have loved to have gone out with a Super Bowl ring similar to
Elway. That didn't happen. But you still look at a 17-year career,
and he's done things no other quarterbacks have done.''
</P>
<P>
   Marino's relationship with the Dolphins soured in his final
season. He was the target of unprecedented criticism from coach
Jimmy Johnson, and they feuded as the team faded.
</P>
<P>
   Marino played poorly in a 62-7 playoff loss at Jacksonville, the
most lopsided defeat in franchise history. Johnson retired the next
day, and new coach Dave Wannstedt repeatedly ducked questions about
whether he wanted Marino back.
</P>
<P>
   Marino voided his contract in February and became a free agent.
When the Dolphins signed free agent quarterback Jay Fiedler to a
three-year, $3.8 million deal, it was apparent Marino had played
his last game in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   Friends say Marino simmered about the way he was treated at the
end, but he declined to complain in public.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've been a Dolphin for 17 years, and I'll be a Dolphin for
the rest of my life,'' he said in February. ''That will never
change.''
</P>
<P>
   Marino was the last active member of the quarterback class of
1983, which also included Elway, Jim Kelly, Ken O'Brien, Todd
Blackledge and Tony Eason. All were drafted before Shula took
Marino with the 27th pick in the first round.
</P>
<P>
   In 1984, his second season, the brash young quarterback threw
for 5,084 yards and 48 touchdowns, league records that still stand.
But that season ended in disappointment as Miami lost to San
Francisco 38-16 in the Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   In a TV commercial taped later, Marino took a soda from 49ers
quarterback Joe Montana.
</P>
<P>
   ''Next time, I buy,'' Marino said. He spent the next 15 years
trying unsuccessfully to return to the title game.
</P>
<P>
   Injuries took a toll in recent seasons. He underwent six knee
operations, and after a neck injury forced him to miss five games
in 1999, his play declined sharply.
</P>
<P>
   He finished the season with 12 touchdown passes and 17
interceptions, by far the worst ratio of his career, and his
quarterback rating ranked 30th in the league.
</P>
<P>
   But the final season likely did little to damage his legacy.
Former NFL coach Mike Ditka once said: ''Dan Marino will go down as
the greatest player in the history of the game.''

<HEADLINE> Baylor's Couts Sets Track Record  </HEADLINE>
By BERT ROSENTHAL, AP Track Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   FAYETTEVILLE, Ark. (AP) -- Clemson's Shawn Crawford and Baylor's
Brandon Couts asserted their speed, UCLA's Tracy O'Hara asserted
her vaulting prowess, and Arkansas' men's team asserted its
strength in the NCAA Indoor Track and Field Championships Friday
night.
</P>
<P>
   Crawford won the men's 200 meters in an American-record 20.26
seconds, beating Florida's John Capel, who had the same time.
</P>
<P>
   ''He came up on me (at the end) and it got a little scary,''
Crawford said after breaking the mark of 20.32 shared by Rohsaan
Griffin and Kevin Little.
</P>
<P>
   The finish was so close that the winner and runner-up had to be
separated by thousandths of a second. Under that method, Crawford
was timed at 20.252 and Capel, last year's NCAA outdoor champion,
at 20.257.
</P>
<P>
   ''I thought I had him on the lean,'' Capel said. ''I was
supposed to be a half-step behind coming into the final curve, but
I let him get two steps ahead. When I came off the curve, I said,
'Go get him.'''
</P>
<P>
   Crawford had set the collegiate record of 20.33 in the prelims,
about 12 hours earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Couts, the Big 12 Conference champion from Baylor, smashed the
collegiate 400-meter record, winning his preliminary heat in 45.60.
</P>
<P>
   The time shattered the record of 45.66 by George Mason's Greg
Haughton in 1995. It also erased the meet record of 45.69 by
Oklahoma's Roxbert Martin in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   In posting the second-fastest time in the world this year --
behind only U.S. champion James Davis' 45.54 -- Couts led the
advance into Saturday's final.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've got to get a title under my belt,'' Couts said. ''The
first year I lost on time'' when he won his heat but finished
second in the two-heat final in 1998, ''and last year I just got
beat'' finishing sixth.
</P>
<P>
   ''Now I'm just trying to run fast.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Brandon did what I felt he was ready to do,'' Baylor coach
Clyde Hart said. ''He was in control the whole time. He got the
lead early and kept it.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Hara, a sophomore, broke the collegiate pole vault record of
13 feet, 11\ three times, clearing 14-0{, then 14-3\ and finally
14-6.
</P>
<P>
   The Arkansas men, seeking their fourth consecutive title and
16th in the past 17 years, took a commanding lead after the first
of two days of competition.
</P>
<P>
   With Melvin Lister winning the long jump at 26-8{, Kenny Evans
finishing second in the high jump with a career-best 7-7, Marcus
Clavelle placing third in the shot put, Lavar Miller tying for
sixth in the high jump, Ramon Washington taking seventh in the long
jump and the distance medley relay team placing third, the
Razorbacks compiled 34{ points, 11 more than runner-up Florida.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA led the women's race with 29 points, followed by BYU with
22 and South Carolina with 21.
</P>
<P>
   In another sizzling performance on the track, Stanford's
distance medley relay team of Gabe Jennings, Evan Kelty, Michael
Stember and Jonathan Riley ran a world-best 9:28.83. The Cardinal
set the previous mark of 9:30.19 on the same track four weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Texas' Mark Boswell, last year's NCAA indoor and
outdoor champion in the men's high jump, won his third collegiate
title, clearing 7-7}, breaking his Canadian, school and Big 12
records of 7-6{.
</P>
<P>
   Boswell, the silver medalist in last year's World Outdoor
Championships and the Pan Am Games gold medalist, then took one
jump at a collegiate record and 2000 world best of 7-10. After
missing once at that height, he passed his next two attempts.
</P>
<P>
   ''I just wanted to see where my timing was,'' Boswell said about
stopping after the one jump at 7-10.
</P>
<P>
   Until that point, he had tried four heights and cleared each on
his first try.
</P>
<P>
   There were numerous other outstanding performances among the
men.
</P>
<P>
   South Carolina's Terrence Trammell, the Southeastern Conference
champion in the 60-meter dash and 60 hurdles, won his second
straight NCAA indoor hurdles title at 7.55, the fastest by a
collegian this season and the third-fastest by an American. He also
qualified for Saturday's final in the dash.
</P>
<P>
   In the hurdles final, Trammell took charge quickly and repulsed
the other challengers.
</P>
<P>
   Missouri's Derrick Peterson, the defending champion in the 800,
ran the fastest time by a collegian in winning his preliminary heat
in 1:48.06, and TCU's Kim Collins won his 60 heat in 6.53, also the
year's fastest by a collegian.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest shocker was the failure of James Karanu of Arkansas,
one of only two collegians to break 4 minutes in the mile this
season, to qualify for Saturday's final. Karanu, bothered by a side
stitch, finished fourth in his heat in 4:06.88.
</P>
<P>
   The most popular women's winner was 5,000-meter runner Amy
Yoder. Taking the lead from Villanova's Carrie Tollefson with about
700 meters left, Yoder then unleashed a furious last-lap push and
beat the Wildcats senior by about 20 meters in 15:46.89, fastest by
an American this year.
</P>
<P>
   ''The crowd carried me,'' Yoder said. ''I never felt any pain.
It was like a train rolling. I kept saying I had another gear, so
go ahead and bring it on.''
</P>
<P>
   Collegiate bests also were registered by Auburn's Vonette Dixon
in the 60 hurdles final in 7.94, SMU's Tytti Reho in the 800
prelims in 2:04.59 and LSU's Peta-Gaye Dowdie in the 200 prelims in
23.02.
</P>
<P>
   Dowdie, last year's winner, pulled up with a calf cramp after
about 30 meters in the final, won by South Carolina's Mikele Barber
in 23.06.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Stanford's distance medley relay team won with a
season-best 11:01.56.

<HEADLINE> Devils 9, Thrashers 0  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA (AP) -- John Madden and Jay Pandolfo had two goals and
Patrik Elias scored a penalty shot as the New Jersey Devils tied
two club records Friday night as they shut out the Atlanta
Thrashers 9-0.
</P>
<P>
   The Devils, who have outscored the expansion Thrashers 18-2 in
three games, tied the club record for margin of victory -- a mark
first set on Oct. 26, 1991, with a 9-0 victory over the expansion
San Jose Sharks.
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey, the top team in the Eastern Conference with 91
points, outshot Atlanta 38-19.
</P>
<P>
   The Devils scored nine goals for the first time since beating
Tampa Bay 9-3 on March 23, 1992. It marked the sixth time they have
scored nine goals since the franchise moved to New Jersey from
Colorado before the 1982-83 season.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta, the worst team in the NHL with 34 points, dropped to
1-21-2 since beating Philadelphia 1-0 on Jan. 14. The Thrashers
have lost seven straight.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Gomez scored the ninth goal, his 17th, with 11:37
remaining on a breakaway power play goal.
</P>
<P>
   Madden's team-record sixth shorthanded goal -- a breakaway shot
from the center of the left circle that sailed past the stick-side
of Atlanta goaltender Damian Rhodes -- gave the Devils a 1-0 lead
9:15 into the first period.
</P>
<P>
   In playing his first game for the Thrashers since being
sidelined Nov. 17 with ankle and knee injuries, Rhodes, Atlanta's
No. 1 goalie, gave up six goals for the second time in 14 starts.
</P>
<P>
   Just 2:32 after Madden's goal, Scott Stevens put the Devils up
2-0 by punching in a ricochet that followed Jason Arnott's slap
shot from the left circle.
</P>
<P>
   Elias made it 3-0 with a penalty shot 14:36 into the first
period by faking to Rhodes' left and then scooping the puck past
the goalie's right side. Atlanta defenseman Geordie Kinnear gave
Elias an opportunity to score his team-high 29th goal by putting a
glove on the puck after it entered the crease.
</P>
<P>
   With only 27 seconds to go in the first, Sergei Nemchinov scored
a breakaway goal for a 4-0 Devils lead. Nemchinov faked left before
scoring on the right side of the crease.
</P>
<P>
   Norm Maracle replaced Rhodes 10:27 into the second period after
Brian Rafalski made it 6-0. On a breakaway opportunity, Rafalski
was in the slot when he took Bobby Holik's pass from the top of the
left circle and ripped it under Rhodes' legs.
</P>
<P>
   Rhodes, who dropped to 3-8-2, faced 19 shots. New Jersey's
Martin Brodeur, who faced only four shots in the third period,
raised his record to 37-14-8.
</P>
<P>
   Maracle, who saved 16 of 19 shots, gave up a sweeping shot to
Madden from the left side of the slot 14:46 into the second period.
Pandolfo made it 8-0 just 14 seconds later with a breakaway shot
from the top of the right circle.
</P>
<P>
   With 7:20 expired in the second period, Pandolfo put the Devils
up 5-0. Rhodes had moved behind the net to get the puck out of
Atlanta's end when his errant pass was stopped by Pandolfo, who
faked left and then scored to his right as Rhodes lay sprawled
across the ice.

<HEADLINE> Cohen: Taiwan Is Not Like Hong Kong  </HEADLINE>
By ROBERT BURNS, AP Military Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   HONG KONG (AP) -- Hong Kong's status as a largely autonomous
region of China is not necessarily a model for how China could
bring Taiwan back into its fold, Defense Secretary William Cohen
said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ''Hong Kong is a unique situation,'' Cohen told reporters as he
arrived for a weekend visit. He met Saturday with Hong Kong's chief
executive, Tung Chee-hwa.
</P>
<P>
   This is Cohen's first visit since Hong Kong reverted to Chinese
control in 1997 after 150 years as a British colony.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think the way in which Hong Kong has functioned under its
relationship with China -- the 'one China, two systems' -- is unique
to it, and I don't think it could be used as any kind of model for
any other country,'' he said when asked how Taiwan might be
reunited with China.
</P>
<P>
   Tung takes a different view from Cohen on the question of Hong
Kong serving as a model for Taiwan, his chief spokesman, Stephen
Lam, told reporters shortly before Cohen met the chief executive.
Lam said that Hong Kong has had a positive experience in the nearly
three years since it returned to Chinese control.
</P>
<P>
   ''We hope this will be a model for our compatriots in Taiwan,''
Lam said. ''We would genuinely like to invite our compatriots in
Taiwan to look at the situation in Hong Kong with an open mind.''
</P>
<P>
   Lam said Tung shares Beijing's view that Taiwan should not wait
indefinitely to negotiate reunification with the mainland. ''They
should really sit down and talk (with Beijing), sooner rather than
later,'' Lam said.
</P>
<P>
   At a photo-taking session with Cohen after their talks, a
smiling Tung told reporters that he and Cohen had not discussed the
question of Hong Kong serving as a model for Taiwan on the
reunification issue.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration has pursued a series of high-level
visits to Hong Kong to underscore its determination to help Hong
Kong remain as free and open as before the July 1997 reversion to
Chinese rule. The 1984 agreement, under which the colony reverted
to Chinese rule, pledged it would retain many of its pre-turnover
laws and social rules.
</P>
<P>
   As a special administrative region, Hong Kong has a high degree
of autonomy from China in all matters except foreign and defense
affairs. That means, for example, that U.S. Navy ship visits to
Hong Kong, routine prior to 1997, are now decided case-by-case in
Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview Friday, Cohen underscored the importance of
regular port calls to Hong Kong by U.S. ships -- an arrangement he
said benefits both the United States and Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
   After the NATO air war against Yugoslavia began last spring,
China halted all military contacts with Washington -- including port
calls to Hong Kong. Since September, all 22 U.S. requests for ship
visits have been approved, a senior U.S. official said. The
official discussed the matter on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   In the interview Friday, Cohen urged a halt to recriminations
between China and Taiwan and said he hoped to visit Beijing this
summer to urge restraint.
</P>
<P>
   ''Both sides should lower the rhetoric and lower the tension and
then try to work this out in a peaceful fashion rather than one of
intimidation and confrontation,'' the defense secretary told
reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the dangers, Cohen said he sees no imminent threat of
war.
</P>
<P>
   ''All of the evidence is that the prospect of it escalating to a
military confrontation is not likely,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He also emphasized the importance of restraint by Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   ''We will continue to insist that the Taiwanese pursue
negotiations peacefully and not seek independence, which we do not
support,'' Cohen said.
</P>
<P>
   In a later interview with CNN in Hong Kong, Cohen dismissed
Chinese charges that the United States is to blame for heightened
tensions. China criticized the Pentagon's announcement this week
that it plans to sell Taiwan more advanced Hawk air defense
missiles and a reconfigured radar system.
</P>
<P>
   ''For China to suggest that we are somehow at fault really
exaggerates the situation,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen said in the earlier interview that he hoped the
''rhetorical tension'' will subside once Taiwan holds its
presidential election March 18.
</P>
<P>
   China sees Taiwan as a renegade province and has said it cannot
rule out using military force if Taiwan tries to gain independence.
Washington recognizes Taiwan as part of ''one China'' but is
committed to providing the weaponry Taiwan needs to defend itself
against attack.
</P>
<P>
   After spending the weekend in Hong Kong, Cohen is scheduled to
travel Monday to Vietnam to become the first American secretary of
defense to visit since the Vietnam War ended in April 1975. He will
be there amid a series of national celebrations over the
communists' defeat of U.S.-backed South Vietnam.

<HEADLINE> Energy Panel: Oil Reserve Dwindling  </HEADLINE>
By BRUCE STANLEY, AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- The world's richest countries have depleted their
oil inventories to the lowest levels seen in four years, a widely
read survey said Friday, reinforcing concerns that motorists will
soon be paying even stiffer prices to fill their tanks.
</P>
<P>
   Pinched profit margins for oil refineries have caused a slowdown
in the production of gasoline and other products, and this delay
could lead to gas shortages during the peak driving season this
summer, the International Energy Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
   World output of oil increased in February by a slight 0.3
percent to 75 million barrels per day.
</P>
<P>
   However, drastic reductions in oil inventories in the United
States, Europe and Japan have created a shortfall in global
petroleum supplies of about 2.5 million barrels per day, said David
Knapp, editor of the IEA's monthly oil report.
</P>
<P>
   This shortfall is expected to widen in the during the second
half of 2000, when consumer demand historically rises, first for
gas and later for home heating oil.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are quite concerned,'' Knapp said from his office in Paris.
</P>
<P>
   For motorists, the report's implications are bleak. Americans
are already paying nearly $1.50 for a gallon of gasoline, compared
to prices of less than $1 last winter.
</P>
<P>
   Average U.S. retail gas prices of $1.80 and even $2 per gallon
are looming on the horizon, warned Roger Diwan of The Petroleum
Finance Company, a consultancy based in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ''You need to build stocks and you need to be able to run your
refineries at a higher rate in order to meet the higher demand,''
Diwan said.
</P>
<P>
   The IEA report reinforces a prediction by the U.S. Energy
Department issued earlier this week that gas prices could spike at
$1.75 to $1.80 this summer because production isn't keeping pace
with demand.
</P>
<P>
   The IEA is part of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and
Development, a group of the world's wealthiest countries. Its
report underscores the importance of the March 27 meeting in Venice
of oil ministers of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries.
</P>
<P>
   OPEC is worried about the recent price volatility, and analysts
now expect the group to ease some of the production cuts that it
made in 1998 and 1999 to boost historically low prices.
</P>
<P>
   OPEC members have refused to specify the likely size of any
increase.John Toalster of SG Securities in London predicted a
''fairly cautious'' addition of a maximum 1.5 million barrels per
day.
</P>
<P>
   The likelihood that OPEC would boost output improved this week
when Iran, one of the group's staunchest price hawks, appeared to
express support for increased production.
</P>
<P>
   However, analysts suggested that OPEC is not likely to pump
enough barrels for importers to meet current demand while also
replenishing oil inventories.
</P>
<P>
   The IEA noted that inventories in rich countries have slipped to
their lowest level since the early spring of 1996. Heavy
consumption should ease somewhat in the second quarter, but demand
will pick up again toward summer, it said.
</P>
<P>
   These factors have contributed to volatile oil prices.
</P>
<P>
   Crude has surged from $10.72 a barrel on Dec. 10, 1998, reaching
a 9-year high of $34.37 during after-hours trading Tuesday on the
New York Mercantile Exchange. At late afternoon in New York, light
sweet crude for April delivery was trading at $31.76 per barrel, up
7 cents.
</P>
<P>
   Heating oil prices doubled in some parts of the northeastern
United States this winter, and U.S. gasoline prices have neared
$1.50 a gallon.
</P>
<P>
   In London, a contract of North Sea Brent crude for April
delivery was trading at $29 per barrel on the International
Petroleum Exchange, down 29 cents from Thursday's close.
</P>
<P>
   OPEC boosted production last month by 540,000 barrels per day,
with Iraq and Nigeria accounting for much of the increase, the IEA
said. OPEC was 74 percent compliant with its output cuts in
February, down slightly from a revised compliance rate for January
of 78 percent.
</P>
<P>
   However, the IEA warned that several OPEC members, including
Venezuela -- the group's No. 3 producer -- are already at or near
their production limits. The report blamed the lack of spare
capacity on a dearth of investment in new equipment during 1998,
when oil prices and revenues were much lower.
</P>
<P>
   The impact of the report, said Peter Gignoux, head of the
petroleum desk at Salomon Smith Barney in London, was to fire
''warning shots all over the place.''

<HEADLINE> No. 13 Texas 78, Colorado 35  </HEADLINE>
By CRAIG HORST, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- Chris Mihm and Texas made the Colorado
Buffaloes realize how weak they are.
</P>
<P>
   The 7-foot center for the 13th-ranked Longhorns Chris Mihm had
19 points, 15 rebounds and five blocked shots as the Longhorns
forced the Buffaloes out of their offense, holding them to 18
percent shooting for a 78-35 victory in the quarterfinals of the
Big 12 tournament Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think our guys are going to spend some time in the weight
room this summer,'' Colorado coach Ricardo Patton said. ''When you
see a guy like Mihm -- big, and strong and athletic -- our guys can't
match up. That's what our guys have to become.''
</P>
<P>
   Colorado suffered the worst loss in the Big 12 tournament's
four-year history, surpassing Nebraska's 91-59 defeat to Kansas in
1998. It was also the fewest points scored by a losing team in
tournament history. Oklahoma State fell 53-37 to Kansas last year.
</P>
<P>
   Colorado had 12 field goals, tying the school record for the
fewest in a game. The Buffs (18-13) were 12-of-66 from the field,
missed all 11 of their 3-point attempts, started the game 0-for-10
and at one point were 1-for-15 in the first half.
</P>
<P>
   ''They're good defenders,'' Colorado guard Jaquay Walls said.
''Every time I got the ball, I had a hand in my face and an elbow
in my back.''
</P>
<P>
   Mihm, getting his 18th double-double of the season, helped the
Longhorns force the Buffs out of their offense as Texas (23-7)
advanced to play either No. 15 Oklahoma or Missouri in the
semifinals Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ''I try and control the paint and really effect people when they
drive to the basket,'' Mihm said. ''We keep the players out of the
lane and on the perimeter. It takes them away from their game
plan.''
</P>
<P>
   Texas had six other blocked shots besides the five by Mihm.
</P>
<P>
   The Longhorns started slowly, leading only 10-7 midway through
the first half, but Gabe Muoneke got the offense started with his
fluid inside moves and finished with 15 points.
</P>
<P>
   Walls had 13 points for the Buffaloes.
</P>
<P>
   Colorado, which frequently failed to hit the rim in the first
half, got its first basket with 13 minutes to play in the half when
Jamahl Mosley finally hit a jumper.
</P>
<P>
   But then Texas, which has limited opponents to 38.9 percent
shooting from the field this season, began to pull away behind
Muoneke to win for the sixth time in seven games and for the 12th
time in the last 14.
</P>
<P>
   Texas finished the first half with a 16-4 run that included a
dunk by Mihm on a breakaway. Mihm then squared up at the top of the
key to hit a 3-pointer to make it 30-13 with 2:45 to play before
halftime.
</P>
<P>
   Lawrence Williams' 3-pointer seconds before the buzzer gave
Texas a 39-15 lead at the half.
</P>
<P>
   Colorado's first shot of the second half hit the side of the
backboard, the Buffs missed their second shot and Walls missed a
dunk on the third shot. The fourth shot was an air ball on a
turnaround jumper by Mosley.

<TEXT>
<P>
   RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) -- Joe Thornton's goal with 1:35 remaining
broke a tie and helped the Boston Bruins snap a five-game losing
slide with a 5-3 win over the Carolina Hurricanes on Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   Brandon Smith also scored a goal and added two assists as Boston
won for only the second time in 11 games.
</P>
<P>
   Carolina, which needed a win to bolster its playoff bid, had won
three straight. Gary Roberts had two power-play goals for the
Hurricanes and Ron Francis had two assists to extend his
points-scoring streak to six games.
</P>
<P>
   Boston was down 3-2 early in the third period before erupting
for three goals. A Smith assist allowed Shawn Bates to tie the
score with his fourth goal of the season 6:42 in, before Thornton's
18th goal, at 18:25, put the Bruins up 4-3. Brian Rolston scored an
empty-net goal in the final minute to seal the outcome.
</P>
<P>
   Boston had taken a 2-0 lead in the first period.
</P>
<P>
   Darren Van Impe, assisted by Smith, scored 2:58 into the game
with a slap shot from outside the blue line that flew caught
Hurricanes goalie Arturs Irbe outside the net. Van Impe had not
scored since Jan. 24 against Calgary, a span of 17 games.
</P>
<P>
   Smith's unassisted goal, his first of the season, came on
another slap shot from behind the blue line at 10:17. Irbe, who was
just past the crease when the puck slipped by him, was pulled
briefly and replaced by Mark Fitzpatrick.
</P>
<P>
   Irbe returned about a minute later.
</P>
<P>
   Roberts cut Boston's lead to 2-1 on a five-on-three power-play
goal at 12:13 of the first. When Bruins goaltender John Grahame
shifted to the left, Roberts shot the puck past him into the
unguarded side.
</P>
<P>
   Carolina tied the score 2-2 at 8:17 of the second period on
another Roberts power-play goal. Jeff O'Neill's shot in the middle
missed to the right, and Roberts redirected the rebound into the
net. Robert Kron's 11th goal, off a pass from Marek Malik, then
gave Carolina its 3-2 lead 2:05 into the third period.
</P>
<P>
   The Hurricanes have scored at least one power-play goal in the
last five games.
</P>
<P>
   Francis, who assisted on both of the power-play tallies Friday,
has scored three goals and had eight assists during his personal
scoring streak.

<P>
   NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- Steve Yzerman had a goal and an assist
in a span of 1:26 of the opening period to lead Detroit over the
Nashville Predators 3-1 Friday night and extend the Red Wings'
unbeaten streak to six games.
</P>
<P>
   Detroit's 34-year-old captain has 29 goals this season and 621
in his career. The Predators have lost six of their last seven
games.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Wings opened the scoring at 16:59 of the opening period
when Pat Verbeek pounded in the rebound of Yzerman's power-play
shot at the left post. The puck hit traffic in front of the goal
and dropped at Verbeek's feet.
</P>
<P>
   Nashville left wing Patric Kjellberg tied the score at 17:27
when he intercepted a Wings clearing pass near the left circle and
skated in alone on Detroit goaltender Chris Osgood. Kjellberg beat
him with a backhander for his 22nd goal in 68 games.
</P>
<P>
   Yzerman scored on an end-to-end rush at 18:25, putting a
backhand through Nashville goalie Mike Dunham's legs from the left
side and giving the Wings the lead for good.
</P>
<P>
   Kirk Maltby scored a shorthanded goal on a slap shot from the
right circle 2:56 into the third to complete the scoring.
</P>
<P>
   The Predators failed to convert on a brief two-man advantage in
the third period before giving up Maltby's goal.

<HEADLINE> Auburn 78, No. 11 Florida 70  </HEADLINE>
By PAUL NEWBERRY, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA (AP) -- On the bus ride to the Georgia Dome, the Auburn
Tigers learned that Chris Porter's college career was over. If they
keep playing like they did Friday night, they'll do just fine
without him.
</P>
<P>
   Daymeon Fishback, hobbled by a sore knee, had 21 points and 14
rebounds for the first double-double of his career, leading the
Tigers to a 77-70 upset victory over No. 11 Florida in the
quarterfinals of the Southeastern Conference tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Auburn (22-8) came through with an inspired performance after
learning on the way to the arena that Porter wouldn't be rejoining
the team. He was declared ineligible two weeks ago for taking
$2,500 from an agent's middleman and lost his final appeal Friday
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   ''This was as fine a win as I've ever been associated with under
the circumstances,'' Auburn coach Cliff Ellis said. ''It's easy
when you have success. But adversity tests your character. There's
not a better character-tester than what we through tonight, because
no one gave this team a reasonable chance of winning.''
</P>
<P>
   Florida (24-7) was the second loser of the day among the four
teams that shared the SEC regular-season title. Earlier, No. 8
Tennessee was upset by South Carolina, which will meet Auburn in
the semifinals Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Porter was declared ineligible on Feb. 27, a few hours before
Auburn played the Gators in Gainesville. Stunned by the loss of
their best player, the Tigers were blown out 88-59.
</P>
<P>
   Auburn lost its last three regular-season games without Porter
and entered the SEC tournament with a four-game losing streak
overall. And, once again, Auburn was dealt a blow before it stepped
on the court against the Gators.
</P>
<P>
   Porter had asked an NCAA appeals committee for reinstatement,
saying he needed the money to keep his mother from being evicted
and didn't know it was coming from an agent. The committee denied
Porter's appeal after a conference call.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's unfortunate that we had to lose Chris,'' said Mack
McGadney, who replaced Porter in the lineup. ''But the season goes
on.''
</P>
<P>
   The Tigers discussed their teammate's plight on the bus, then
left the issue behind.
</P>
<P>
   ''We finally had some closure,'' point guard Doc Robinson said.
''Once we learned he was not coming back, we decided to play our
hardest and do whatever it takes to win the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Auburn closed the first half with a 13-7 run for a 44-41 lead at
halftime, taking advantage of a technical on coach Billy Donovan
for a four-point swing during one sequence. The Tigers zealously
guarded their advantage throughout the final 20 minutes -- never
pushing the lead beyond single figures but never losing the upper
hand.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think we underestimated them,'' said Florida star Mike
Miller, who had 14 points and 11 rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   ''We obviously did a very poor job over the past 12 hours of
preparing them,'' Donovan added. ''Basically, their team destroyed
us. Auburn, I thought, wanted the game more than we did.''
</P>
<P>
   Fishback, one of three senior starters, hit a key 3-pointer with
4:22 remaining after Brett Nelson brought the Gators within 62-59
on a 3-pointer.
</P>
<P>
   Fishback added a couple of free throws to push the lead to 67-59
and Auburn sealed the victory at the foul line after Miller's
jumper cut the margin to 68-64 with 1:09 left.
</P>
<P>
   ''They're a veteran basketball team with a lot of pride,''
Donovan said. ''They went out and played with tremendous heart,
pride and character.''
</P>
<P>
   McGadney added 15 points and Scott Pohlman had 10 despite the
flu. Donnell Harvey led Florida with 15 points.
</P>
<P>
   Florida actually had five more baskets from the field, but
Auburn took advantage of a staggering 32 fouls by the pressing
Gators. The Tigers made 32-of-44 at the line, countering a 21-of-63
performance from the field.
</P>
<P>
   ''You've got to give a lot of credit to our backcourt,'' Ellis
said. ''We attacked the press and got some good opportunities.
Usually, Florida is so deep that around the 10-minute mark of the
second half, they snap you. But we didn't break. The truth be told,
we broke their press so much they had to call it off.''
</P>
<P>
   Florida's shooters, perhaps fatigued by playing for the second
night in a row, also looked ragged. They made only 26-of-71 (37
percent).
</P>
<P>
   Despite sharing the SEC title with Tennessee, Kentucky and LSU,
the Gators were forced to play in the opening round as the No. 3
seed in the East. Auburn, seeded second in the West, earned a
first-round bye even though it had three more SEC losses than
Florida.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's difficult to win,'' Donovan said, ''when you put a team
on the free-throw line 44 times.''

<HEADLINE> No.14 Old Dominion 89 ECarolina 60  </HEADLINE>
By HANK KURZ Jr., AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   RICHMOND, Va. (AP) -- So much for No. 14 Old Dominion's
vulnerability.
</P>
<P>
   The Lady Monarchs rebounded from a close quarterfinal victory
over George Mason on Thursday with an 89-60 thrashing of East
Carolina on Friday night to advance to the championship of the
Colonial Athletic Association tournament.
</P>
<P>
   ''Collectively we weren't happy with our performance
yesterday,'' said Natalie Diaz, who led the charge against the Lady
Pirates with 14 points, nine rebounds and seven assists. ''We kind
of used that as a little spark. We came in so focused today that we
were able to do things that we weren't able to do yesterday.''
</P>
<P>
   Essentially, that amounted to a lot of everything as Old
Dominion (26-4) extended its winning streak against CAA teams to
101 games and moved within one of setting an NCAA record with its
ninth consecutive conference tournament title.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas women won eight straight Southwest Conference crowns
from 1983-90, and Old Dominion will take a 26-0 record in its CAA
tournament history into the potential tiebreaker Saturday against
North Carolina-Wilmington, which beat James Madison 65-62.
</P>
<P>
   The Lady Monarchs shot 53.4 percent, outrebounded East Carolina
48-28 and held all-CAA first team forward Danielle Melvin to one
point and five rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   ''They did a perfect job on me,'' said Melvin, who came in
averaging 16.2 points and 8.3 rebounds. ''Wherever I turned it felt
like I turned into a wall.''
</P>
<P>
   Old Dominion, meantime, could do almost nothing wrong. They
opened a 30-9 lead after 10{ minutes, led 45-29 at halftime and by
at least 16 the rest of the way.
</P>
<P>
   ''We knew with our limited numbers and lack of size, we were
going to really have to fight and claw for everything,'' Lady
Monarchs coach Wendy Larry said. ''We talked about going to war to
advance, and they went to war.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our five starters from the jump attacked and we didn't let
up.''
</P>
<P>
   East Carolina (15-14), playing in its final CAA tournament
before a move to Conference USA in two years, was eliminated by Old
Dominion for the second consecutive year. Last year, the Lady
Pirates lost 73-67 in the championship.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Dee Gibson said she watched the Lady Monarchs struggle
against George Mason on Thursday and knew that would spell trouble
for their semifinals foe.
</P>
<P>
   ''I looked at my assistant, and I didn't tell this to our
players, but I looked at her and said, 'I feel sorry for the team
that has to play them tomorrow,''' she said. ''I turned out to be
us, but I knew they would be ready to play.''
</P>
<P>
   The Lady Monarchs took control early, running of 25 of 30 points
in one early stretch to turn a 5-4 game into a 30-9 runaway. Diaz
hit four jumpers in the burst, and Old Dominion was a combined
12-for-16 from the field in the run.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was all about focus for us,'' the senior forward said.
</P>
<P>
   The Lady Monarchs, playing without scoring and rebounding leader
Lucienne Berthieu because of a sprained right shoulder, got 16
points each from Okeisha Howard and Sharron Francis, 15 from
Hamchetou Maiga and 14 from Diaz and Kim Giddens. Point guard Alli
Spence added 10 points, seven assists and three steals.
</P>
<P>
   ''They're better (without Berthieu),'' Gibson said, ''because
they know they have to be better. They know everybody has to step
up without their All-American.''
</P>
<P>
   Rosalyn Canady led the Lady Pirates with 20 points and Waynetta
Veney had 17. East Carolina shot just 37 percent (20-for-52) and
had 16 turnovers.

Gore, Bush Victorious in Colorado, Utah
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP)-- Presidential hopefuls Al Gore and George W. Bush enjoyed
uncontested victories today in Colorado and Utah and began confronting each
other in a marathon struggle for the general election eight months away. The two
Western primaries, along with Republican county conventions plus a straw poll in
Wyoming, are the remnants of a failed attempt to gain clout for Rocky Mountain
and Western states in the nomination of presidents. As the campaign turned out,
it would not have mattered, with Republican challenger John McCain and Democrat
Bill Bradley both out of the race.

20 Die in Sri Lanka Bomb Explosion
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) -- A bomber blew himself up, killing at least 20
other people and wounding 64 on a busy street in Sri Lanka's capital Friday, but
apparently missed his target -- a motorcade of Cabinet ministers. Authorities
said three separatist rebels, believed accomplices in the bombing, killed
themselves Saturday after hundreds of police and anti-terrorist commandos
surrounded the apartment building they were hiding in. The Liberation Tigers of
Tamil Eelam are the principal suspects in most explosions in Sri Lanka. The
guerrilla group has been fighting for 17 years for a separate homeland for the
country's 3.3 million Tamils, a minority of Sri Lanka's 18.6-million. The
conflict has claimed 61,000 lives.

Russia Claims Rout of Rebel
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   KOMSOMOLSKOYE, Russia (AP) -- A Russian commander claimed Friday that a major
group of Chechen rebels was routed in fierce fighting in the republic's
mountains, while Russian jets intensely bombed the village of Komsomolskoye to
try to drive out rebels. Lt. Gen. Gennady Troshev, a top commander for Chechnya,
said a group of about 2,500 rebels was defeated after battles around the village
of Ulus-Kert, where fighting had raged for about two weeks. The battle for
Komsomolskoye, which began when Chechens seized the village Sunday, underlines
Russia's inability to rout Chechnya's militants after six months of war, even
though Russian troops outnumber them and have superior weapons.

Iranians Said Indicted for Spying
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   GREAT FALLS, Mont. (AP) -- Eight Iranian Defense Ministry officials are under
federal indictment here on charges they tried to obtain military secrets and
smuggle them out of the country, a Customs Service agent said. Special agent
Brian Buschini told the Great Falls Tribune in an interview published today that
authorities decided to release some information to help locate one of the eight
who is known to travel extensively in the United States and Europe. The Iranian
officials have never been arrested. According to the Tribune, Buschini would not
say what secrets the Iranians allegedly tried to obtain, but said their success
would have significantly compromised U.S. military abilities in the Middle East.

approval of the deal with conditions came just after the collapse of Qwest

their home winning streak to 11 games. The Heat have defeated the Nuggets nine
straight games and haven't lost to Denver since a 100-98 loss on March 3, 1995,

Knicks defeated the Philadelphia 76ers 82-77 tonight. Ewing, using his patented
fadeaway jumper, sank what became the game-winner with one second left on the

Sprewell stole the ball when the pass was tipped. He made two free throws with
11.6 seconds left to seal the victory.

<HEADLINE> 20 Die in Sri Lanka Bomb Explosion  </HEADLINE>
By DILSHIKA JAYAMAHA, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) -- A bomber blew himself up, killing at
least 20 other people and wounding 64 on a busy street in Sri
Lanka's capital Friday, but apparently missed his target -- a
motorcade of Cabinet ministers.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities said four separatist rebels, believed accomplices in
the bombing, killed themselves Saturday after hundreds of police
and anti-terrorist commandos surrounded the apartment building they
were hiding in.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is all over now; thank God,'' said S. Indika, owner of the
apartment. ''Probably the terrorists realized that there was no
hope as our army was firing from all sides. They went to the roof
through the staircase and killed themselves,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Police said the bomb attack was planned: in addition to the bomb
that went off, jackets laden with explosives and two
rocket-propelled grenades were found in the area. Military
officials blamed Tamil separatists for the blast.
</P>
<P>
   The wounded and the dead, mostly people who had been headed home
from work, were taken to the National Hospital in Colombo, many
with abdominal injuries. Two dozen cars were damaged.
</P>
<P>
   ''There were lots of vehicles at that time, and then there was a
big explosion and then I heard gunfire after the blast,'' said D.A.
Ratnayake, a traffic policeman who was wounded in the explosion.
</P>
<P>
   Ratnayake was part of a large security detail, including
anti-terrorist commandos, assigned to guard the Cabinet ministers
as they traveled home from Parliament. Six of those killed in the
blast were police officers.
</P>
<P>
   Up to an hour after Friday's blast, gunfire could be heard from
the cordoned-off Borella area, the commercial hub of Colombo. At
least 200 soldiers took up positions on the streets and helicopters
circled the area.
</P>
<P>
   The search continued into Saturday. At daybreak, gunfire erupted
again in the cordoned area and hundreds of security forces took up
positions near the apartment complex.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities said the four who committed suicide appeared to be
in their early 20s. Their automatic rifles and ammunition was
scattered around them.
</P>
<P>
   The blast came as Parliament discussed extending emergency rule
in northern Sri Lanka, a measure that gives broad powers to the
army and police fighting Tamil rebels there.
</P>
<P>
   Science and Technology Minister Batty Weerakoon said Friday that
the country's defense minister might have been the target of the
bombing. ''The defense minister was in parliament. This was a known
fact. ...I am not surprised if he was the target.''
</P>
<P>
   The defense minister, Anuruddha Ratwatte, heads military
operations against the rebel movement, known as the Tamil Tigers.
He narrowly escaped two previous assassination attempts.
</P>
<P>
   Based on remains found at the scene, police believe the suicide
bomber was either in a car or leaving it, with the intention of
stationing himself in the front of the ministers' motorcade.
</P>
<P>
   The bomb apparently went off prematurely, said authorities,
speaking on condition of anonymity. It was unclear if the bomber
was carrying the device or if it was in his car.
</P>
<P>
   There was no claim of responsibility for the bombing.
</P>
<P>
   The Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam are the principal suspects
in most explosions in Sri Lanka.
</P>
<P>
   The guerrilla group has been fighting for 17 years for a
separate homeland for the country's 3.3 million Tamils, a minority
of Sri Lanka's 18.6-million, mainly Sinhalese population. The
conflict has claimed 61,000 lives.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, analysts and rebels expressed confidence that an
Oslo-backed peace initiative to end the war will continue despite
the fall of Norway's coalition government Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Norway has been trying to facilitate peace talks. The Sri Lankan
government held unsuccessful negotiations with the rebels in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   The government is pushing a new constitution that would provide
wide autonomy to the eight provinces in the island nation off the
coast of India.

<HEADLINE> No. 5 Michigan State 75, Iowa 65  </HEADLINE>
By NANCY ARMOUR, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- For 30 minutes, the scrappy Iowa Hawkeyes played
with one of the best teams in the country. Then, in the closing
minutes, Mateen Cleaves and Charlie Bell did what great, veteran
players do.
</P>
<P>
   They took the game over and they won it.
</P>
<P>
   Cleaves and Bell scored 11 of No. 5 Michigan State's last 18
points Friday night as the Spartans withstood a furious effort from
Dean Oliver to beat the Hawkeyes 75-65 in the Big Ten tournament.
</P>
<P>
   ''You can't let them see you sweat,'' said Cleaves, who finished
with 14 and seven assists. ''You want to win the game, but you've
got to stay calm.''
</P>
<P>
   Bell finished with 16 points. Morris Peterson, the coaches'
choice for Big Ten player of the year, led the Spartans (24-7) with
22 points, including 12 from 3-point range.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our kids did a great job competing,'' Iowa coach Steve Alford
said. ''But with five minutes to go, their All-Americans stepped up
and made plays.''
</P>
<P>
   Oliver made a few plays of his own for the seventh-seeded
Hawkeyes (14-16). The junior, who was scoreless in Thursday's
first-round victory over Minnesota, bounced back with a career-high
30 points and four assists.
</P>
<P>
   He outplayed Cleaves and Bell, and he came through whenever Iowa
needed a bucket to stay in the game.
</P>
<P>
   ''Coach was teasing me, calling me Mr. Donut, glazed for
short,'' Oliver said of his oh-for night Thursday. ''I just forgot
about it. I was really determined to come out and have a good
showing and lead my team in this game.''
</P>
<P>
   But it wasn't enough for the Hawkeyes, who needed four free
throws in the final 15 seconds after blowing a 21-point lead
against Minnesota. They shot just 40 percent (24-of-60) from the
field against Michigan State, and gave up 19 points on nine
turnovers -- three of which came in the first three minutes of the
game.
</P>
<P>
   Center Jacob Jaacks also sat most of the second half before
fouling out with 3:10 left to play.
</P>
<P>
   The victory sends the Spartans into the tournament semifinals
Saturday, where they'll meet the winner of the Wisconsin-Purdue
game. And with so many top teams stumbling this week -- the Spartans
took the court just two hours after No. 4 Ohio State lost --
Michigan State kept alive its hopes for a second straight No. 1
seed in the NCAA tournament.
</P>
<P>
   ''Yeah, I saw the games on television,'' Peterson said. ''Toward
the end of the game, that was running through my mind, how a lot of
No. 1 and No. 2 seeds were falling. But we didn't fall.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Spartans will have to tighten up their game. They barely
outrebounded the Hawkeyes (37-35), got only four points from their
bench and gave up 15 points on 12 turnovers.
</P>
<P>
   Cleaves had four turnovers, the same number as he had in the
entire Big Ten tournament last year.
</P>
<P>
   ''We didn't have our best game,'' Cleaves said. ''We're not
satisfied with how we played, but we won. I'm happy to be standing
here as a winner, preparing for the next game instead of getting on
the bus to go home.''
</P>
<P>
   And in the end, no matter how sloppy they play, Michigan State
always finds a way to get it done. After Oliver hit a 3-pointer and
a driving layup to cut Michigan State's lead to 51-50 with 11:54
left, the Spartans looked as if they were going to break the game
open.
</P>
<P>
   Peterson hit yet another 3, his fourth of the night, Granger
made a 3-pointer and Bell tipped in Peterson's miss to give
Michigan State a 59-52 lead with 8:18 left.
</P>
<P>
   But there, again, was that pesky Oliver. After an Iowa timeout,
he hit a 12-foot jumper and a 3-pointer to make it a two-point game
with 6:54 left.
</P>
<P>
   ''I felt confident. I really thought we were going to win the
game,'' Oliver said. ''It seemed like everything was going our
way.''
</P>
<P>
   Until Cleaves and Bell decided they'd had enough. Bell hit a
jumper, and Cleaves followed with a jumper in the lane. After Jason
Richardson made two free throws, Cleaves hit another jumper to give
the Spartans a 67-58 lead with 2:17 left, and the game was all but
over.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've played some pretty good teams,'' said Alford, whose team
also played Connecticut, Stanford and Missouri. ''And I think
Michigan State is the best team we've played this year.''

<HEADLINE> Tuvaluans Grieve School Fire Deaths  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) -- The tiny South Pacific nation of
Tuvalu grieved Saturday for 18 schoolgirls and their supervisor who
were killed when fire swept through their locked dormitory.
Thousands more Tuvaluans who live in New Zealand joined the
mourning.
</P>
<P>
   The tragedy occurred when fire, believed to have been started by
a student's candle, swept through the girls dorm at the Motutoua
Secondary School. The dorm, which was locked, was an old wooden
building whose door had been fastened shut and its open windows
covered in wire mesh.
</P>
<P>
   The school is the tiny nation's largest, with about 300
students, both boys and girls.
</P>
<P>
   A mass burial was held on the remote coral atoll of Vaitupu,
attended by Tuvalu Prime Minister Ionatana Ionatana.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Ionatana said officials decided on the mass
burial because the bodies were burned beyond recognition and could
not be returned to their parents.
</P>
<P>
   The dead students, aged 14 to 17, were trapped inside their
dormitory at the school when the fire began. The supervisor died as
she attempted to rescue them, Radio Tuvalu reporter Diana Semi told
Australia's National Nine News on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The government is investigating the blaze.
</P>
<P>
   Acting Prime Minister Jim Anderton sent a letter to the Tuvalu
government Friday expressing New Zealand's sympathy and
condolences.
</P>
<P>
   ''I said that not just their country, but many people in New
Zealand would be grieving with them today,'' Anderton said. Nearly
5,000 Tuvaluans live in New Zealand.
</P>
<P>
   Formerly known as the Ellice Islands, Tuvalu is a nation of
9,500 people on nine coral atolls with a total area of just 10
square miles. It lies 610 miles north of Fiji.
</P>
<P>
   The islands achieved independence from Britain in 1978.

<HEADLINE> Panthers 4, Lightning 3  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- Mike Wilson scored the go-ahead goal with
8:18 to play and the Florida Panthers beat the Tampa Bay Lightning
4-3 in an fight-filled game Friday night to move into a tie for
first place in the Southeast Division.
</P>
<P>
   Pavel Bure added his league-leading 46th goal as Florida did all
of its scoring during a third period that was delayed twice by
altercations involving 10 players.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson scored on a slap shot from the high slot as the Panthers
beat the Lightning for the ninth straight time and pulled even with
Washington atop the Southeast.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first time Florida has won when trailing after two
periods. The Panthers had been 0-17-1 in such games before Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Tampa Bay has lost six straight.
</P>
<P>
   Bure's goal was one of three Florida power-play goals during the
first half of the third period.
</P>
<P>
   Bret Hedican started the scoring barrage about 2:30 into the
final period, pulling the Panthers within 2-1. The Lightning
countered on Robert Petrovicky's power-play goal two minutes later.
</P>
<P>
   The Panthers converted their next two power plays, evening the
game at 3-3 with 12 minutes left on goals from Peter Worrell and
Bure, who has 12 goals in 11 career games against Tampa Bay.
</P>
<P>
   The game was delayed 10 minutes a little more than halfway
through the third period by a fight near the Lightning bench.
</P>
<P>
   A second, shorter delay took place just after Wilson's goal.
</P>
<P>
   Goals by Mike Johnson and Pavel Kubina put the Lightning up 2-0
in the second period. Brian Holzinger, one of three players
acquired earlier in the day from Buffalo in exchange for team
captain Chris Gratton, set up the Johnson goal with a pass through
the slot during a 2-on-1 break.
</P>
<P>
   The Lightning outshot Florida 13-4 in the first period, but were
kept off the scoreboard on a great play by Jaroslav Spacek. The
Florida defenseman swept the puck off the goal line after Kubina's
shot trickled past goalie Trevor Kidd.
</P>
<P>
   Hedican duplicated Spacek's feat in the second period after
Johnson's shot deflected off a skate.
</P>
<P>
   The other two players the Lightning acquired from Buffalo --
Wayne Primeau and Cory Sarich -- also played against the Panthers.
</P>
<P>
   Vincent Lecavalier, a 19-year-old center, was named the new
Lightning captain and responded with two assists in the game.
</P>
<P>
   Florida played without centers Oleg Kvasha (knee sprain) and
Viktor Kozlov (shoulder sprain). Kvasha is expected to miss a week,
while Kozlov is day to day.

<HEADLINE> Cards' McGwire Hits First Spring HR  </HEADLINE>
By The Associated Press	   Mark McGwire, playing his ninth game of the spring,
finally hit
his first home run.
<TEXT>
<P>
   McGwire, who has hit 135 the last two seasons, connected in the
sixth inning Friday off Ugueth Urbina as the St. Louis Cardinals
lost to a Montreal Expos' split squad 5-3 in Jupiter, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   His towering drive to left was his first homer in 14 spring
at-bats.
</P>
<P>
   ''The ball was up in the air and the wind blew it out,'' McGwire
said. ''That's the only way you can explain it.''
</P>
<P>
   McGwire also had an RBI double off the center-field wall in the
third off Hideki Irabu. He's 5-for-14 with four RBIs, but has
rarely gotten the ball in the air. Not that he's worried about
that, either.
</P>
<P>
   ''I know when I have to be ready; I've done this too long,'' he
said. ''These are questions you should ask a rookie.''
</P>
<P>
   In Tampa, Fla., George Steinbrenner finally saw his New York
Yankees win.
</P>
<P>
   Roger Clemens allowed one run in four innings, and Paul O'Neill
and Tino Martinez hit first-inning homers as the Yankees beat the
Philadelphia Phillies 6-2 in a spilt-squad game.
</P>
<P>
   ''Hopefully it's starting to come together,'' Yankees manager
Joe Torre said.
</P>
<P>
   Steinbrenner had watched all seven Yankees' losses this spring,
and had missed the their only other win, Wednesday over Boston in
Fort Myers.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neill hit a solo homer and Martinez added a two-run shot off
Randy Wolf as New York took a 3-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   In Kissimmee, Fla., Bobby Bonilla connected against his former
team, a two-run triple off Grant Roberts in the ninth inning of the
Atlanta Braves' 7-2 loss to a Mets' split squad.
</P>
<P>
   New York released Bonilla during the offseason after a
controversial 1999 season in which he confronted manager Bobby
Valentine, then reportedly played cards in the clubhouse as the
Mets played the final innings of Game 6 of the NL championship
series at Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Edgardo Alfonso and Jorge Toca each hit two-run homers, and four
Mets pitchers combined on a two-hitter.
</P>
<P>
   In Winter Haven, Fla., Jim Thome, Richie Sexson and David
Justice homered off John Burkett in a four-pitch span during the
sixth inning.
</P>
<P>
   In other games:
Astros 7, Dodgers 4:
</P>
<P>
   At Kissimmee, Fla., Gary Sheffield hit a first-inning home run
off his uncle, Dwight Gooden. Matt Mieske hit a three-run double
off Terry Adams in a five-run seventh as the Astros improved to
7-1, the best spring training record in the majors. The Dodgers
have the worst mark at 1-9.
Mets (ss) 7, Expos (ss) 2:
</P>
<P>
   At Port St. Lucie, Fla., Bobby J. Jones gave up one hit in four
innings, four days after he lasted just nine batters against the
Expos, allowing seven earned runs and six hits.
Phillies (ss) 12, Pirates 8:
</P>
<P>
   At Bradenton, Fla., Scott Rolen and Pat Burrell each homered,
had three hits and drove in three runs.
Tigers 12 Royals 9:
</P>
<P>
   At Lakeland, Fla., Damion Easley hit a three-run homer and
finished with four RBIs. Easley and Juan Encarnacion both homered

<HEADLINE> Heavy Winds Kill 3 in Texas  </HEADLINE>
By SUSAN PARROTT, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas (AP) -- Thunderstorms moved through North Texas
with winds up to 70 mph Friday, causing damage estimated in the
millions of dollars at the Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport.
Three people died in traffic accidents.
</P>
<P>
   A 16-year-old girl died when her car hydroplaned on Texas 155
near Tyler and skidded into an 18-wheeler, the Texas Department of
Public Safety said.
</P>
<P>
   Two other people died when an 18-wheeler slid across the median
on Interstate 20 during a rainstorm and collided with another
18-wheeler, which was hauling a tanker full of fuel, public safety
spokesman Tom Vinger said. Two pickups and a car were also involved
in the accident.
</P>
<P>
   In Irving, several high-rise construction sites and large office
buildings were damaged east of the airport. At one site, three
people inside an office trailer were injured -- one seriously -- when
winds toppled the structure.
</P>
<P>
   There was no dollar estimate on the damage, but it could run
into the tens of millions, said Sandra Ray, public relations
director of the Southwestern Insurance Information.
</P>
<P>
   ''There was a lot of damage to businesses, so we could be
talking about some high numbers here,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   About a mile away, two plumbers inside another office trailer
were thrown about when winds up to 70 mph ripped through the
parking lot. One worker had minor cuts to his head. The other man
escaped injury, said Jason Nunley, who works for C.D. Henderson,
Inc. of Garland.
</P>
<P>
   A Delta Air Lines hangar at the airport was damaged by strong
winds that ripped portions of the roof off. Some American Airlines
and Delta planes were delayed because of the weather.

<HEADLINE> Former Manager Addresses Charges  </HEADLINE>
By BEN WALKER, AP Baseball Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dick Williams, whose Hall of Fame hopes were dashed by a recent
charge of indecent exposure, admits he ''probably did the dumbest
thing of my life.'' The former manager also insists he's not a
deviant.
</P>
<P>
   Williams was accused of walking naked and masturbating outside
his hotel room in Fort Myers, Fla., on Jan. 17. The 70-year-old
special adviser to the New York Yankees spent the night in jail.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm stupid and guilty of being nude in the doorway,'' Williams
said Friday night by phone from his home in Henderson, Nev. ''But I
was not masturbating. That part is simply not true and I want
people to know it.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I was looking out for a few seconds before dressing for bed,''
he said in his first public comment on the episode. ''But I was not
doing anything else. I was not walking around on a balcony, I had
no intention of being seen. That is totally ridiculous.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams, who guided the Oakland Athletics to World Series
championships in 1972-73 and won pennants with two other teams, has
paid heavily for the misstep.
</P>
<P>
   Many observers thought he would be elected to the Hall of Fame
by the Veterans Committee in March, ahead of Sparky Anderson.
Instead, Williams, who won more than 1,500 games with Boston,
Oakland, California, Montreal, San Diego and Seattle, had virtually
no chance.
</P>
<P>
   Williams also said the Yankees suggested he stay away from
spring training camp in Tampa, Fla., for this year.
</P>
<P>
   ''With everything else they had going on with Darryl Strawberry,
they wanted to let this die down and I agreed with them,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And he became the butt of jokes throughout the baseball world
after it was learned he'd been arrested while attending the World
Series of Fantasy Baseball Camp.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was traumatized by it, I was so embarrassed,'' he said. ''I
was embarrassed for my family, my friends, everyone.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams said he did not tell his wife, Norma, about the arrest
for a week. He did, however, speak to Yankees owner George
Steinbrenner.
</P>
<P>
   ''I called George right away and told him what happened. At
first, he laughed and said, 'You're too old for that.' But I told
him I didn't want to embarrass the New York Yankees.''
</P>
<P>
   At a hearing the day after his arrest, Williams pleaded no
contest and Judge Hugh Starnes withheld judgment. Williams was
released on time served, set free ''in my pajamas,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Williams said he did not know he was being accused of more than
being naked. According to a Lee County Sheriff's Office report, a
woman who worked next door to the hotel called the deputies, and
when they knocked on Williams' door, he was wearing pajamas.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was unaware of the masturbation charge because I was never
informed of it,'' he said. ''Neither the arresting officer, the
judge or anyone from the sheriff's department said a word about it.
When I pleaded no contest, I honestly did not know that was part of
it. I've even passed two polygraph tests, trying to clear my
name.''
</P>
<P>
   It was only later that he thought about how the whole thing
might hurt his Hall of Fame chances.
</P>
<P>
   Williams' career record was 1,571-1,451. He led Oakland, Boston
and San Diego into the World Series, making him and Bill McKechnie
the only managers to do it with three teams.
</P>
<P>
   ''I thought this thing could finish me after 54 years in
baseball,'' he said. ''But if I'm not eligible for the Hall of
Fame, I'll live with that stigma.''
</P>
<P>
   When the Veterans Committee met Feb. 29 at Tampa, chairman Joe
Brown initially told the 14-man panel not to vote for Williams. But
Brown was quickly corrected, and members were informed Williams was
indeed eligible.
</P>
<P>
   ''He was voted upon,'' Hall spokesman Jeff Idelson said. ''He
wasn't removed. He was a candidate for election.''
</P>
<P>
   It is expected that Williams will be on the ballot next spring.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's for others to judge whether I should be in the Hall of
Fame,'' Williams said. ''I think my record speaks for itself.''

<HEADLINE> U.N. Implicates 2 African Presidents  </HEADLINE>
By NICOLE WINFIELD, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- Two sitting African presidents are
implicated in a U.N. report that details sanctions violations that
have enabled rebels in Angola to finance their war, two sources who
read the report said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Togolese President Gnassingbe Eyadema and Burkina Faso's
President Blaise Compaore are accused of having allowed
sanctions-busting activities in their countries, the sources said,
speaking on condition of anonymity. They said the report recommends
punitive measures against the violators
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. Security Council imposed an arms and fuel embargo on
UNITA rebels in 1993. Five years later, it expanded the measures to
include a ban on rebel diamond exports, which are estimated to have
supplied the group with up to $4 billion since 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Togo's U.N. ambassador, Roland Yao Kpotsra, said late Friday
that he understood Togo was implicated but said he couldn't comment
until he had read the report. Officials at Burkina Faso's mission
said no one was available to comment.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the presidents, individuals and officials in
Gabon, Rwanda, South Africa, Congo, Republic of Congo, Ivory Coast,
and the late president of then-Zaire, Mobutu Sese Seko, are accused
of violating the sanctions, the sources said, reading from the
report.
</P>
<P>
   The violations included providing fuel and arms to the UNITA
rebels, allowing planes carrying banned items to refuel in their
countries, and dealing in banned UNITA diamonds, said a Western
U.N. diplomat.
</P>
<P>
   The document, which is to be released Wednesday, is the product
of a panel of experts established by the Security Council last year
to pinpoint how sanction violations allowed the rebels to relaunch
their war against the government in December 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. panel of experts, the brainchild of the sanctions
committee chairman, Ambassador Robert Fowler of Canada, visited
several African countries in the past six months and questioned top
diamond dealers in London to prepare the report.
</P>
<P>
   The experts found that the Antwerp, Belgium diamond market,
described as the largest in the world for rough stones, has
''extremely lax controls and regulations,'' that allows illegal
trading of banned UNITA diamonds, one source said, quoting from the
report.
</P>
<P>
   The panel recommends sanctions for the sanctions-busters,
including a call for a three-year arms embargo on any country that
supplies UNITA with weapons. And they recommend a blacklist of
countries that do business with UNITA in violation of the
sanctions, one source said.
</P>
<P>
   South African Ambassador Dumisana Shadrack Kumalo said he had
been briefed on the report and welcomed it, saying his government
had cooperated in putting it together. South African individuals
and companies were implicated in the report for diamond and arms
dealings, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The report names a few known individual sanctions-busters. It
does not provide significant details about individual diamond
companies that have bought UNITA diamonds in violation of the
sanctions, one source said.
</P>
<P>
   The government and UNITA, a Portuguese acronym for the National
Union for the Total Independence of Angola, began fighting after
Angola gained independence from Portugal in 1975. A 1994
U.N.-mediated truce collapsed when the government sought in 1998 to
take back land forcibly that UNITA refused to hand over as part of
the peace agreement.

<HEADLINE> Pistons 111, Grizzlies 97  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUBURN HILLS, Mich. (AP) -- Jerry Stackhouse and Grant Hill
scored 27 points apiece as the Detroit Pistons defeated the
Vancouver Grizzlies 111-97 Friday night after Joe Dumars' No. 4
jersey was retired.
</P>
<P>
   Detroit has won two straight and moved back to .500 (30-30)
since George Irvine replaced head coach Alvin Gentry on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The Grizzlies have lost seven straight, including a 0-3 mark on
their current road trip.
</P>
<P>
   Hill added nine rebounds and six assists, and the Pistons also
got a season-high 16 points from Michael Curry and 10 points and 12
rebounds from Jerome Williams.
</P>
<P>
   Othella Harrington led Vancouver with 25 points and Shareef
Abdur-Rahim had 16.
</P>
<P>
   The game did not start until 8:45 p.m. local time because of a
45-minute ceremony to retire Dumars jersey.
</P>
<P>
   The Pistons blew open a close game with a 15-1 run to start the
second quarter and led 60-44 at the half. Stackhouse had 16 in the
half, while Hill added 15 and seven rebounds. The Pistons also
turned 14 Vancouver turnovers into 17 points.
</P>
<P>
   Vancouver cut the margin to 62-51 early in the third as the
Pistons struggled from the floor. Detroit hit just four of its
first 12 shots, but Vancouver still couldn't get the margin back to
single digits.
</P>
<P>
   Detroit only managed 16 points in the third, but the Grizzlies
weren't much better and still trailed 76-64 at the beginning of the
fourth.
</P>
<P>
   The Pistons then put the game away by outscoring Vancouver 10-2
in the first three minutes of the fourth. Stackhouse led the way
with two dunks, as the run put them up 86-66.
</P>
<P>
   Detroit cruised from there, relaxing enough for Hill to throw a
spectacular off-the-backboard alley-oop to Williams.
</P>
<P>
Notes: The win was Detroit's first over Vancouver in over three
years. The teams didn't play in the lockout-shortened 1998-99
season, and Vancouver won the only two meetings of 1997-98. ...
Detroit native Aretha Franklin sang the national anthem as part of
the Dumars ceremony. ... Eric Montross, who shot just 34 percent
from the free-throw line last season, finally made his first foul
shot of the year. He entered the game having missed his only two
attempts, and missed badly on his first try Friday. But his second
one, a jumper, hit the rim and dropped in.

<HEADLINE> Sabres Get Gilmour From Chicago  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN WAWROW, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) -- The slumping Buffalo Sabres hope Doug
Gilmour's grit, leadership and experience will bolster their
stretch drive for the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   The Sabres acquired the 36-year-old center from the Chicago
Blackhawks on Friday for forward Michal Grosek, who last month
expressed his displeasure at being benched by coach Lindy Ruff.
</P>
<P>
   The Sabres also got rookie forward J.P. Dumont from Chicago. The
trade came less than 12 hours after the Sabres landed Chris Gratton
in a four-player, two-draft pick deal with the Tampa Bay Lightning.
</P>
<P>
   The moves just before Tuesday's trade deadline come as the
Sabres -- 2-4-1 in their last seven games -- fight for a spot in the
playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Going into Friday night's game against Montreal, Buffalo was two
points behind the Canadiens and the New York Rangers -- tied for the
eighth and final playoff spot -- and one behind Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   Gilmour, a two-time All Star who scored the Stanley
Cup-clinching goal with the 1989 Calgary Flames, wasn't expected to
dress for the game. He missed Chicago's last four games because of
a rib injury and was to be evaluated upon arrival in Buffalo.
</P>
<P>
   ''Doug Gilmour gives us a strong presence on and off the ice,
and someone who has won a Stanley Cup,'' Sabres general manager
Darcy Regier said.
</P>
<P>
   The deals fill an obvious need for the Sabres, whose captain and
star center, Michael Peca, might miss the rest of the regular
season with a dislocated shoulder. Gratton was captain of the
Lightning and Gilmour captained the Toronto Maple Leafs for nearly
three seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Gilmour, who was told by Chicago management to expect a trade a
month ago, arrived in Buffalo an hour prior to the Sabres game
against Montreal, but did not play.
</P>
<P>
   Following the Sabres 3-2 loss, Gilmour said he's fully recovered
from his rib injury that forced him to miss the Blackhawks' last
four games. And, he added, he understands his role in Buffalo and
what the Sabres have to do to get in the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ''With 13 games left, we have to be focused each and every night
and somehow pull this out and, you're right, that's why I was
brought here, so hopefully I can have some kind of impact,''
Gilmour said.
</P>
<P>
   The Sabres were relatively unchanged from the team that reached
last year's Stanley Cup Finals, but Regier felt the team had not
come together.
</P>
<P>
   ''For whatever reasons, our guys weren't able to really gel,
grab the ball and run with it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''These trades were made first and foremost to focus on the
playoffs. That's the immediate thing but certainly addresses needs
beyond that.''
</P>
<P>
   Acquiring Gilmour and his hefty salary was a major departure for
the usually frugal Sabres. Gilmour is in the second year of a
three-year contract that pays him $6 million this season and $6
million next season.
</P>
<P>
   Regier said the team is prepared to keep Gilmour through the end
of the contract.
</P>
<P>
   Blackhawks GM Mike Smith said Chicago will pick up part of the
paycheck, but wouldn't say how much.
</P>
<P>
   Gilmour, who has played for St. Louis, Calgary, Toronto and New
Jersey, has 22 goals and 34 assists in 63 games this season with
Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   The Blackhawks are in last place in the Western Conference, 15
points behind eighth-place San Jose.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're in a rebuilding process and don't want to take three
years to rebuild,'' Smith said. ''One of the deficiencies on our
team is our lack of aggressive and physical play. Michal Grosek is
an aggravating and aggressive forward.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith was general manager of the Winnipeg Jets when they drafted
Grosek in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   In return for Gratton, Tampa Bay acquired regulars Brian
Holzinger and Wayne Primeau, two players who have underachieved
this season, and promising young defenseman Cory Sarich. The clubs
also traded draft picks, with the Sabres giving up their
third-round pick in this summer's draft for Tampa Bay's
second-round pick in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   The deals mark the most significant moves the Sabres have made
since 1995 when they dealt high-scoring winger Alexander Mogilny to
the Vancouver Canucks for Peca and defensemen Jay McKee and Mike
Wilson.
</P>
<P>
   With Gratton gone, the Lightning are turning to promising young
star Vincent Lecavalier.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is Vinnie Lecavalier's team. He is one of the premier
players in the league and he's 19 years old,'' Lightning coach
Steve Ludzik said. ''It was tough to move your captain. But we're
trying to build something here. We had to take apart before we can
build up.''
</P>
<P>
   Gratton, 24, had 14 goals and 41 points for the Lightning this
season. Dumont, 21, has 10 goals and eight assists in 47 games with
Chicago, and Grosek, 24, has 11 goals and 23 assists in 61 games
with the Sabres.
</P>
<P>
   ''Whenever it happens it's pretty shocking,'' Gratton said.
''Your life gets turned upside down pretty quickly. But once you
find out you're getting put back in the playoff race, it's good
feeling. And I'm very happy to be here.''

<HEADLINE> No. 6 Temple 54, UMass 47  </HEADLINE>
By ROB MAADDI, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- After watching three higher-ranked teams
lose in the last two days, No. 6 Temple has its sights set on a No.
1 seed in the NCAA Tournament.
</P>
<P>
   The Owls took another step toward possibly getting that berth by
beating Massachusetts 54-47 on Friday night in the Atlantic 10
semifinals.
</P>
<P>
   ''We want that No. 1 seed,'' said Mark Karcher, who scored 14
points and had five assists against UMass. ''We don't know how that
works, but we want to keep winning, get momentum and hopefully get
that top seed.''
</P>
<P>
   Temple (25-5), seeking its first A-10 tournament title since
1990, will play St. Bonaventure in the championship game Saturday.
The Owls might be in position to get the No. 1 seed because No. 1
Cincinnati, No. 2 Stanford and No. 4 Ohio State lost in the last
two days.
</P>
<P>
   ''It means a lot us to get the No. 1 seed,'' said Quincy Wadley,
who scored 12 points. ''It may not make much of a difference, but
it's supposed to mean you get an easier road to the championship
and that's what we work hard for all year.''
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Lyde led Temple with 15 points on 6-for-6 shooting, and
Karcher made some brilliant passes and steals to stave off UMass
(17-15).
</P>
<P>
   Karcher came up with two steals a few possessions apart as UMass
stayed within four points. He then made three clutch passes setting
up easy baskets for Temple, which used a 9-2 run to break open a
two-point game and take a 46-37 lead with 4:27 left to play.
</P>
<P>
   Karcher found Lamont Barnes inside for a layup and a 41-35 lead
with 7:34 remaining. After a basket by Kitwana Rhymer, Karcher
passed to Lyde for a dunk to give Temple a 43-37 lead.
</P>
<P>
   A UMass turnover led to another basket for the Owls as Karcher
again found Barnes inside for a layup to give Temple its biggest
lead to that point, 45-37 with 4:53 left.
</P>
<P>
   UMass did not get closer than six points the rest of the game.
</P>
<P>
   ''If my scoring falls off, I want to stay on the floor with my
defense,'' Karcher said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm really pleased with his hustle and what he brings to the
floor,'' Temple coach John Chaney said. ''But I'd like to see him
get to the line more. He's got to pump-fake the ball more and we're
always telling him that. He's so used to overpowering guys and
shooting that he gets his shot blocked too much.''
</P>
<P>
   Karcher shot 4-of-12, including 3-of-8 from 3-point range and
was 3-for-6 at the foul line.
</P>
<P>
   Monty Mack led the Minutemen with 16 points on 5-for-14
shooting. Rhymer added 12. Shannon Crooks had nine points on
4-for-12 shooting.
</P>
<P>
   UMass played patiently against Temple's zone, and stayed close
throughout the game. But the Minutemen could not get a key basket
despite several chances to tie or take the lead in the second half.
</P>
<P>
   ''We played our best basketball of the season,'' UMass coach
Bruiser Flint said. ''We did some good things here and I hope we
continue. I think we should be in the NIT.''
</P>
<P>
   Pepe Sanchez, Temple's floor leader, scored just one point, had
three assists and three turnovers. He had four steals.
</P>
<P>
   Sanchez did not score until hitting a free throw with 1:53
remaining to give Temple its biggest lead of the game, 49-39.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was a horrible game to watch, but we won,'' Sanchez said.
''You have to win some horrible games if you want to win a
championship.''
</P>
<P>
   Temple shot 18-of-40 (45 percent) while UMass was 16-of-41 (39
percent). The teams combined to shoot 7-for-26 from 3-point range
and committed 23 turnovers. Temple won the battle on the boards,
27-24.
</P>
<P>
   Temple, which has won 16 of its last 17 games, played UMass five
times in the A-10 final, with UMass winning the last four.

<HEADLINE> Four Die in Texas Helicopter Crash  </HEADLINE>
By PAM EASTON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALHART, Texas (AP) -- A medical helicopter carrying a
4-month-old girl with breathing problems from a remote Oklahoma
town crashed Friday shortly after taking off in fog, killing the
baby and the three-person crew.
</P>
<P>
   National Transportation Safety Board investigators were on their
way to the scene, about 20 miles north of this Texas Panhandle
town.
</P>
<P>
   ''We don't know whether he hit power lines or had a mechanical
failure,'' said NTSB spokesman Doug Wigington. ''We are also
looking to see if weather might be a possible cause.''
</P>
<P>
   The Life Star helicopter left Northwest Texas Healthcare System
in Amarillo to pick up the girl in Boise City, Okla., about 100
miles to the north, and was returning at the time of the crash.
</P>
<P>
   The craft, which was leased to the small Amarillo hospital, had
landed about 15 miles south of Boise City because of fog and was
met by an ambulance carrying baby Kathy Esparza, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   After the child was put aboard, the helicopter took off in fog
at 6:05 a.m., and the crew was not heard from again, said
Department of Public Safety Sgt. James R. Woodrum. When the fog
lifted nearly five hours later, the wreckage was discovered less
than a mile away.
</P>
<P>
   The transfer and the crash occurred near the community of
Coldwater, Texas, three miles south of the Oklahoma state line. The
helicopter was following power lines along a roadway, officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It looks like they impacted on their nose and nobody knows
exactly why. It looks like it either exploded or started burning
immediately on impact, and then it caught the grass on fire,''
Woodrum said.
</P>
<P>
   The debris was scattered over an area about 400 feet by 100
feet.
</P>
<P>
   Kathy's mother, who was driving to the hospital, didn't learn of
the crash until she arrived in Amarillo, said Moody Chisholm, chief
executive officer of Northwest Texas Healthcare System. Parents
typically do not ride in the helicopter.
</P>
<P>
   The helicopter had no history of accident or safety problems,
said John Clabes, a Federal Aviation Administration spokesman. The
craft was leased to the hospital by TEMSCO Helicopters Inc. of
Ketchikan, Alaska.
</P>
<P>
   Flags were at half-staff at the Amarillo hospital on Friday.
Helicopter pilots and hospital staff members gathered in the
hallways, hugging and crying.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have absolutely saved hundreds and hundreds of lives with
this helicopter,'' Chisholm said. ''We are all in a lot of pain
that we have lost this crew and patient. If we can get past this,
it still is a service that is needed out here.''
</P>
<P>
   He said Lauren Stone, a 30-year old flight nurse, and Terry
Griffith, a 35 year-old flight paramedic, were killed in the crash.
The identity of the pilot wasn't released.
</P>
<P>
   The crash was the second fatal medical helicopter accident in
Texas within a year. Three crew members died in July when a
helicopter based at Hermann Hospital in Houston crashed outside the
city.

<HEADLINE> Gore, Ventura To Meet Saturday  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MINNEAPOLIS, Minn. (AP) -- Vice President Al Gore and Minnesota
Gov. Jesse Ventura, the Reform Party's marquee politician until he
recently quit the national organization, have set up a meeting on
Saturday to talk about campaign finance reform, a Gore spokesman
said.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, has
suddenly stepped up his campaign to reach out to independent and
reform-minded voters in the wake of Republican John McCain's exit
from the race for the White House, leaving the GOP field to George
W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Gore spokesman Chris Lehane said the vice president called
Ventura by telephone Friday night as Gore flew to Minneapolis for a
town meeting, and the two agreed to meet Saturday morning.
</P>
<P>
   Lehane said Gore suggested they talk about campaign finance
reform, the centerpiece of McCain's campaign and now an issue
adopted by the vice president, who was caught up in Democratic
party fund-raising scandals during the 1996 Clinton-Gore
re-election campaign.
</P>
<P>
   McCain suspended his campaign on Thursday, the same day Gore's
rival Bill Bradley bowed out.
</P>
<P>
   Bush and Gore have been trading charges in recent days over
political fund-raising abuses.
</P>
<P>
   Ventura bolted the national Reform Party last month and urged
his state party to do so as well, saying the national organization
had become too riven by internal disputes.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, at a town hall meeting in Bloomington, Minn., Friday night
appeared with former Vice President Walter Mondale to address
veterans at a VFW Hall. Telling the gathering he was a veteran of
the Vietnam War, he declared, ''I'm for more money for veterans'
health care.''

<HEADLINE> Bush, Gore Win Broad Support  </HEADLINE>
By JUDITH KOHLER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER (AP) -- George W. Bush swept nearly every voter group in
overwhelmingly conservative Colorado and Utah Republican
electorates Friday, although more than half of self-described
independents preferred John McCain, who's no longer running, or
Alan Keyes, exit polls found.
</P>
<P>
   In Colorado's Democratic presidential primary, about the only
voters Vice President Al Gore did not win convincingly were the
roughly 45 percent who view President Clinton unfavorably as a
person. Half of them sided with Bill Bradley, who also dropped his
presidential bid this week.
</P>
<P>
   Bush and Gore won voters across age, income and philosophical
brackets in their respective parties in Colorado and Utah,
according to Voter News Service exit polls for The Associated Press
and television networks.
</P>
<P>
   ''Bush seems pretty sure of himself and what he wants to
accomplish,'' said Nancy Wright, 39, an office manager from
Englewood, Colo., and a Republican who voted for Bush. She also had
nice things to say about McCain, agreeing he helped make the race
''lively.''
</P>
<P>
   Seven in 10 GOP primary voters in Utah called themselves
conservative, a bigger share than in any other Republican contest
with exit polls this year except the Iowa caucuses. Six in 10 in
Colorado described themselves as conservative. Strong conservatives
typically are reliable voters even in largely uncontested elections
like those on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Keyes, making by far in his strongest showing of the primary
campaign in Utah, drew a third of GOP primary voters there who
called themselves very conservative.
</P>
<P>
   One in four Colorado GOP voters said they were part of the
religious right, and six in 10 had a favorable opinion of the
movement, which has a stronghold in Colorado Springs. Among those
who viewed the religious right unfavorably, more than half
supported McCain, who had criticized some Christian conservative
political leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Nine in 10 Utah GOP primary voters were Mormon and half cited
moral values as the most important issue in their vote. A third
said that in the Colorado GOP primary.
</P>
<P>
   Bush won about a third of self-described independents in
Colorado and McCain took more than half. Bush did slightly better
among independents in Utah but a third backed Keyes and one in five
favored McCain, who ended his campaign Thursday, essentially
conceding the nomination to Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Six in 10 McCain voters in Colorado and four in 10 in Utah said
they would consider voting for a third-party candidate in November
rather than Bush or Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Colorado GOP primary voters were split on whether gun rights
were more important than reducing gun violence -- a polarizing issue
in the state after last year's Columbine High School massacre.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican findings were from Voter News Service interviews
with 889 GOP primary voters in Colorado and 1,004 in Utah. Results
in each poll were subject to sampling error of plus or minus 4
percentage points, larger for subgroups.
</P>
<P>
   The Colorado Democratic poll interviewed 362 voters and carried
an error margin of plus or minus 7 points. Because of low turnout
in Utah -- the nation's most Republican state -- the Democratic exit
poll sample there was too small to be statistically reliable.

<HEADLINE> Islanders 4, Stars 3 (OT)  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS (AP) -- Olli Jokinen's goal with 1:28 left in overtime
gave the New York Islanders a 4-3 victory over the depleted Dallas
Stars on Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   Jokinen got behind the Dallas defense, took a pass from Eric
Cairns and lifted the puck over Stars goalie Manny Fernandez for
his ninth goal of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Dmitri Nabokov had scored the tying goal early in the third
period for the Islanders, 3-1-1 in their last five games.
</P>
<P>
   In the second period, Mike Modano became the Stars' all-time
goal-scoring leader and Jamie Langenbrunner sent Dallas ahead 3-2.
</P>
<P>
   Modano moved out of a tie with Brian Bellows with his 343rd
career goal (32nd of the season) at 12:59 of the second period,
tying the game at 2-2 on a power play.
</P>
<P>
   Langenbrunner put the Stars ahead at 17:56, converting another
power play from the left circle for his 11th goal.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars thought they had scored the go-ahead goal 10 seconds
earlier when the puck glanced off rookie Jon Sim's skate and past
Islanders goalie Kevin Weekes. But after a replay review, it was
ruled that Sim illegally kicked the puck into the net.
</P>
<P>
   The Islanders made it 3-all at 1:07 of the third period when
Nabokov scored his third goal of the season on a backhander from
close range.
</P>
<P>
   Dave Scatchard and Brad Isbister had first-period goals for the
Islanders.
</P>
<P>
   Center Joe Nieuwendyk, the MVP of the Stanley Cup Finals last
June, returned to the Dallas lineup with a goal and an assist after
missing 21 games due to a separated shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   But the Stars were without seven injured regulars and No. 1
goalie Ed Belfour, who was scratched from the lineup for the second
straight game while he is being evaluated by officials from the
league's substance abuse program. Belfour was in police custody for
more than six hours early Wednesday morning following a scuffle
with a local hotel security guard. Police said Belfour had been
drinking prior to the incident.
</P>
<P>
   Belfour was charged with assault and resisting arrest. He will
remain away from the team until the issue is resolved, making Manny
Fernandez the starter and rookie Marty Turco the backup.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars also played without right wing Brett Hull, who'll miss
the next week while he tries to get healthy from a strained hip
flexor, and defenseman Derian Hatcher, day-to-day with a strained
Achilles tendon.
</P>
<P>
   With Stars regulars Guy Carbonneau, Jere Lehtinen, Blake Sloan,
Shawn Chambers, and Brian Skrudland out with injuries, coach Ken
Hitchcock was forced to juggle his lines and defensive pairings.
</P>
<P>
   Hitchcock, coaching his 356th game, was denied his 200th NHL
victory. He would have become the fourth-fastest coach to reach the
milestone in league history.

   Nieuwendyk converted a power play on his first shot, 3:59 after
the opening faceoff, for his 12th goal and a 1-0 advantage.
</P>
<P>
   But the Islanders, 5-0 losers at Phoenix on Thursday, beat
Fernandez twice over a span of 2:41 in the first period for a 2-1
lead. Scatchard got his 12th at 7:02 skating from behind the net,
then Brad Isbister sent the Isles in front at 9:43 with his 16th on
a power play rebound of his own shot.

   PHOENIX (AP) -- Howard Eisley swished a 3-pointer with 1.1
seconds remaining as the Utah Jazz beat the Phoenix Suns 99-96
Friday night for their seventh straight victory.
</P>
<P>
   Eisley had all 11 of his points in the fourth quarter for the
Jazz, who have won 12 of 14 since the All-Star break. Karl Malone
finished with 29 points, Byron Russell had 22 and John Stockton
added 17 points and 12 assists.
</P>
<P>
   Penny Hardaway had 28 points for Phoenix, which had its
five-game winning streak snapped and lost at home for the first
time in 12 games.
</P>
<P>
   The Suns also lost Tom Gugliotta, who hurt his left knee in a
collision with teammate Randy Livingston under the Utah basket with
3:09 to play.
</P>
<P>
   Gugliotta was helped to the locker room and the Suns said he
would undergo an MRI exam Saturday and not accompany the team on
its upcoming road trip.
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix, down 28-21 after the first quarter and 44-40 at
halftime, took its first lead of the game at 63-62 on Hardaway's
free throws with 1:45 left in the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   He hit a jumper and two more foul shots in the final 47 seconds
to put the Suns up 67-66 entering the final period.
</P>
<P>
   Livingston came off the Suns bench to score all nine of his
points in the last 10 minutes, making a 3-pointer with 7:25 left
and feeding Jason Kidd for a driving lay-in 23 seconds later for an
80-75 Phoenix lead.
</P>
<P>
   But Malone's three-point play and Eisley's layup tied the score
at 80 with 6:20 to play.
</P>
<P>
   There were five more ties until Luc Longley hit a 15-foot jumper
with 43 seconds remaining to put Phoenix ahead 96-94.
</P>
<P>
   Eisley's driving layup tied the score again with 26 seconds
showing.
</P>
<P>
   Utah set up its winning basket when Malone rebounded Hardaway's
missed drive with six seconds left and flipped the ball to Eisley,
who raced to the 3-point arc and calmly sank a jumper over Cliff
Robinson.
</P>
<P>
   Kidd's desperation jumper at the buzzer bounced high off the
back of the rim as the Suns lost at home for the first time since
Jan. 14.
</P>
<P>
Notes: With the win, the Jazz assured themselves of their 17th
consecutive winning season. Only the Boston Celtics have a longer
streak (19 from the 1950-51 through 1968-69 seasons). ... The Suns
have dominated the all-time series with the Jazz by a 64-48 margin,
including 43-13 in Phoenix, but Utah has now won 14 of 19 meetings
since March 1995. ... Jazz are an NBA-best 21-1 when they score 100
or more points this season. ... Phoenix is on pace to win 34 home
games this season, the most since the 1993-94 team was 36-5 at
America West Arena.
