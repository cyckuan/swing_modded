<HEADLINE> US Trade Deficit Climb Up to 10.2 Bln Dlrs in May </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 18 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. trade deficit surged
to 10.2 billion U.S. dollars in May, the U.S. Commerce Department
reported here today.
</P>
<P>
The 17 percent increase from some 8.7 billion dollars in April
in the monthly deficit is the biggest imbalance in four months,
and was worse than some analysts had expected.
</P>
<P>
In May, imports of goods and services increased 1 percent,
pushing them to a record high of 87.47 billion dollars, also
representing growth for a seventh straight month. Meanwhile,
exports fell a slight 0.8 percent to 77.24 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
America's foreign oil bill rose 8 percent to 5.3 billion
dollars as higher volume offset a slight decline in price. The
average price for a barrel of crude oil declined for the fourth
straight month, falling from 17.17 dollars in April to 17 dollars
a barrel in May, the lowest level in 15 months.
</P>
<P>
Imports of foreign cars and auto parts were up 331 million
dollars to 11.7 billion dollars in May despite the fact that auto
shipments from Japan declined by 256 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
According to the U.S. government's report, the deficit with
China climbed 9.1 percent to 3.8 billion dollars, the worst
showing in seven months, as imports of Chinese toys climbed by 110
million dollars and shipments of shoes and clothing also showed
big increases. It marked the third month that the deficit with
China had surpassed that with Japan.
</P>
<P>
The deficit with Japan had a sharp 25 percent drop to 3.6
billion dollars in May. However, the improvement came after
several months of big increases. So far this year, the deficit
with Japan is running 14 percent higher than the imbalance for the
first five months of 1996.
</P>
<P>
The trade gap widened by a big margin with America's two
members of the North America Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). The
imbalance with Mexico climbed 22 percent to an all-time high of
1.7 billion dollars. The deficit with Canada more than doubled to
1.7 billion dollars as imports from Canada climbed to 14.5 billion
dollars, the highest figure ever for a single country.
</P>
<P>
Economists attributed the country's foreign trade troubles to a
variety of factors. The U.S. dollar, until recently, has been
strengthening against other key currencies, making foreign goods
cheaper in this market and America exports more expensive
overseas.
</P>
<P>
In addition, key U.S. export markets including Japan and Europe
have been struggling with weak growth, cutting into American
sales, while the U.S. economy has been surging this year, pushing
up demand for both domestic and foreign products.
</P>
<P>
So far this year, the U.S. trade deficit in goods and services
is running at an annual rate of 115.4 billion dollars, which is
expected to surpass the imbalance of 111 billion dollars last
year.

<HEADLINE> Canada's Consumers, Businesses More Confident </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, July 18 (Xinhua) -- Canadian consumers and businesses
have become more confident in the country's economy and are more
willing to spend, said reports today.
</P>
<P>
According to the Conference Board of Canada, Canadian consumer
confidence reached in the second quarter its highest level in
eight years, and business confidence registered its top reading
since it began its survey in 1977.
</P>
<P>
It was the sixth consecutive increase for the index of consumer
attitudes of the board, an Ottawa-based economic think tank.
</P>
<P>
Almost 60 percent of the consumers surveyed said it was a good
time to make a major purchase.
</P>
<P>
"It's finally reached a point where we feel it's breaking
through a barrier of some kind," Paul Darby, director of the
board's economic services, was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
The board's consumer index reached 116.2, up from 108 in the
first quarter of the year. At its latest level, the index is
closing in on the readings in the 120s that characterized Canada's
boom years of the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
Yet, Canadian consumers are still a bit wary about their own
finances. More than half said they expected no change in their
financial condition in the next six months, while 16 percent
expected it to worsen.
</P>
<P>
The after-tax income of Canadians fell 1 percent in real terms
from the first quarter of 1996 to the first quarter of 1997 and
consumers are carrying a heavy debt load, the board noted.
</P>
<P>
In a separate survey, the board found that Canadian businesses
were even more buoyant than consumers.
</P>
<P>
Its index of business confidence rose to a record 165 from
160.1 in the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
More than 77 percent of the companies polled said it was good
time to invest in plant and equipment.
</P>
<P>
And 36 percent said they planned to increase capital spending
by more than 10 percent in the next six months.

<HEADLINE> Northern Irish Peace Talks Discussed in London </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 18 (Xinhua) -- British and Irish ministers met
here today to try to maintain the momentum towards substantive
all-party talks on the issue of Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
After their three-hour meeting, Britain's Northern Ireland
Secretary Mo Mowlam and Irish Foreign Minister Ray Burke expressed
welcome to a statement by Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams in which he
said the two governments had removed some obstacles to meaningful
negotiations on Northern Ireland's future.
</P>
<P>
The statement was issued jointly by Adams, whose party is the
political wing of the Irish Republican Army (IRA), and John Hume,
leader of the province's largest Catholic party, the Social
Democratic and Labor Party, after talks Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"It is our view that the peace process can be restored and that
with political will on all sides we can move towards a new
political agreement," they said in the statement.
</P>
<P>
Asked whether the statement would help efforts to establish
peace in the province, Northern Ireland Secretary Mowlam told
reporters, "I hope it is a precursor, but I think we will have to
wait and see where we go from that statement."
</P>
<P>
Irish Foreign Minister Burke said, "Obviously I welcome the
statement." "I hope that we will have an early restoration of the
unequivocal IRA cease-fire and I hope it will be sooner rather
than later," he added.
</P>
<P>
The IRA abandoned a 17-month cease-fire in February last year,
resuming its 28-year struggle for a united Ireland. Britain and
Ireland insist it must lay down its arms again if it is to join
all-party talks on the future of the province.

<HEADLINE> Pele Named WHO Ambassador for Leprosy Elimination </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, July 18 (Xinhua) -- Former world soccer star Pele of
Brazil was named by the World Health Organization (WHO) as a
"goodwill ambassador" for eliminating of leprosy around the world,
a WHO press release said here on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The 57-year-old Pele, who's real name is Edson Arantes do
Nascimento, is the Minister of Sport of Brazil and was considered
the world greatest striker during 1958 and 1970, scoring a total
of 1281 goals in 1363 matches.
</P>
<P>
WHO sets a target to eliminate this ancient disease by the year
2000, reducing the prevalence of the disease, worldwide, to less
than one case per 10,000 population.
</P>
<P>
There are some 888,340 known cases of leprosy in the world but
WHO estimates that there are 1.15 million.
</P>
<P>
Pele is already involved in leprosy elimination campaigns in
Brazil, the second worst leprosy-hit country with a total of
106,000 cases behind India, which has more than 500,000.

<HEADLINE> Canada's Electronic Banking to Increase Rapidly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, July 18 (Xinhua) -- Banking by Internet, phone and
debit card is expected to soar in Canada over the next three
years, said a report today.
</P>
<P>
Computer banking -- primarily on the Internet -- is expected to
skyrocket by 450 percent in Canada over the three years, according
to Ernst &AMP; Young Canada, a company that did a 17-country study of
banking and financial institutions recently.
</P>
<P>
Banking in cyberspace is just getting going now, but the
Internet "is going to be one of the fastest growing distribution
channels within the next three years," said Ali Hamza, a principal
of the company.
</P>
<P>
The survey also suggests comparable growth in the use of
banking by phone and an 82 percent rise in such things as debit
card transactions by 1999.
</P>
<P>
"From the bank's point of view, technology banking is lower
cost," Hamza was quoted by the Financial Post newspaper as saying.
"From the customer's point of view, it's more convenient."
</P>
<P>
However, bank branching will still remain the No.1 way
Canadians bank, Hamza added.

<HEADLINE> Kohl Blasts Opposition SPD for Blocking Tax Reform Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, July 18 (Xinhua) -- German Chancellor Helmut Kohl today
blasted in the upper house of parliament Bundesrat the main
opposition Social Democrats (SPD) for blocking the tax reform
planned by his center-right government.
</P>
<P>
"This is betrayal of the unemployed," said Kohl, who blamed the
country's current tax system for hindering the creation of jobs.
</P>
<P>
Germany's joblessness is now at a near-record 11 percent. The
government's tax reform package would lead to a net 30 billion
mark (16.7 billion US dollar) tax cut.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference, Kohl accused the SPD, which holds the
majority in Bundesrat, of cold-bloodedly seeking to block a
government tax reform success without caring what price Germans
paid for the tactic.
</P>
<P>
Kohl noted that the SPD intended to see worsened unemployment
so that they could exploit this in the upcoming election in
September 1998. He added that he was willing to negotiate a
compromise tax bill with the opposition and threatened to make the
SPD blockade a key issue in the general election, in which he
plans to seek a fifth four-year term.
</P>
<P>
"I have no doubt, (my) coalition will win the next election,"
said Kohl.
</P>
<P>
Kohl also said that besides tax, pension and healthcare
reforms, European integration and binding together eastern and
western Germany remained the top priorities for his government
prior to the election.
</P>
<P>
The German chancellor today also reiterated his determination
not to allow the membership criteria of the planned single
European currency, the euro, to be watered down, nor the startup
of the euro scheduled for January 1, 1999 to be delayed.
</P>
<P>
Kohl also repeated his pledge that Germany would meet the
budget deficit limit of 3 percent of the gross domestic product as
required to qualify for the euro membership. Germany has failed to
do so over recent years.
</P>
<P>
Kohl predicted Germany's economic growth would be up to 3
percent in 1998, compared to an expected 2.5 percent growth this
year.

<HEADLINE> Peacekeepers Urged to Be Conversant With UN </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, July 18 (Xinhua) -- Chief of Staff of the air force of
Zimbabwe, Henry Muchena today called on forces involved in
peacekeeping operations to be conversant with the UN charter
governing them.
</P>
<P>
Muchena made the remarks after closing a five-day seminar on
military justice and peacekeeping, reported the Zimbabwe News
Agency.
</P>
<P>
"Member states of the United Nations are individually bound by
that charter, and any violation of the law of war by a force of
any member state is the sole responsibility of that country," he
said.
</P>
<P>
As armies are now more challenged by peacekeeping operations,
the military faces a legal problem because each country has its
own rules so it is important to understand and adhere to a common
charter that governs them all, he said.
</P>
<P>
In his address to officers from the army, airforce, police and
the Defense Ministry, Muchena said that adhering to the U.N. charter
is important for Zimbabwe which has been involved in peacekeeping
operations in Africa.
</P>
<P>
The seminar was the fifth in a series conducted by a U.S. team
of instructors under the auspices of the Naval Justice School's
detachment of international training.

<HEADLINE> Annan Proposes to Renew UNIFIL Mandate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, July 18 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan today proposed to renew the mandate of the United Nations
Interim Force on Lebanon (UNIFIL) for a further period of six
months.
</P>
<P>
The move came after the deputy permanent representative of
Lebanon to the United Nations described his government's position
on the situation in southern Lebanon in a letter to the UN chief
and conveyed his government's request that the Security Council
extend the mandate of the UNIFIL for a further period of six
month.
</P>
<P>
In his report, Annan said that during the past six months,
hostilities continued between the Israel Force and its local
Lebanese auxiliary, the de facto force, on the one hand, and armed
elements who have proclaimed their resistance to the Israeli
occupation on the other hand. The level of hostilities was higher
than in the previous period.
</P>
<P>
Annan said that although the UNIFIL continued to be prevented
from implementing its mandate, the contribution to stability and
protection it was able to afford the population of the area
remained important.
</P>
<P>
The UN chief, therefore, recommended that the Security Council
extend the mandate of the UNIFIL for another period of six months
until January 31, 1998.

<HEADLINE> Kenya's Opposition Calls for "Full" Reforms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
NAIROBI, July 18 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan opposition leaders today
called for full constitutional reforms instead of minimum changes
they had advocated before, saying the ruling party's concessions
were "insufficient" and "in deception to buy time".
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, they demanded a neutral independent electoral
commission to guarantee free and fair elections, equal access to
media for all political parties, as well as a ceiling on election
spending and the state funding for political parties.
</P>
<P>
These are the opposition's three essential demands which
"have not even been touched upon in (the ruling party) KANU's
package of reforms," leader of the National Development Party,
Raila Odinga, said at a press conference here.
</P>
<P>
"FORD-Asili will not accept piecemeal concessions from
(Kenyan President Daniel arap) Moi," said the party's National
Chairman Kenneth Matiba earlier today, charging Moi's shift "is
merely another gimmick" with aims to diffuse the pressure for
reforms.
</P>
<P>
The ruling Kenyan African National Union (KANU) on Thursday
recommended the government put forward a bill in parliament for
enactment of a commission to review the constitution and make
proposals.
</P>
<P>
KANU also suggested that the government issue a Statute Law
bill in the current session of the parliament to allow the repeal
or amendment of laws charged as oppressive.
</P>

<P>
JOHANNESBURG, July 18 (Xinhua) -- Finance ministers and
central bankers from the 12 Southern African Development
Community (SADC) countries met in Pretoria, the capital of South
Africa today to discuss regional economic cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The delegates had examined "details of economic convergence,"
South African Finance Minister Trevor Manuel told a media
briefing after the meeting.
</P>
<P>
The ministers called for a draft finance and investment
protocol to be drawn up by April next year, which would
eventually commit member countries to certain economic norms and
standards, Manuel said.
</P>
<P>
Botswana's Vice-President and Finance Minister Festus Mogae
said macro-economic convergence would take the form of a package,
giving consideration to such factors as investment flows,
inflation, foreign exchange control, and incentive packages.
</P>
<P>
Economic cooperation would be deepened through the creation of
regional sub-committees on investment, macro-economic policy,
development finance and customs and excise, said a media statement
released at the briefing.
</P>
<P>
The 12 SADC countries are Angola, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi,

<HEADLINE> S.leone Talks Resume in Cote d'Ivoire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, July 18 (Xinhua ) -- West African foreign ministers
began a second day of talks with representatives of Sierra
Leone's military rulers in Abidjan on Friday as part of efforts
to reverse the May 25 coup there and restore President Ahmad
Tejan Kabbah to power.
</P>
<P>
Reports reaching here today said that the talks in Cote
d'Ivoire's capital Abidjan adjourned Thursday on a hopeful note
with Nigerian Foreign Minister Tom Ikimi, saying they had made
substantial progress.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria, which heads a west African force trying to restore
peace and democracy to both Sierra Leone and neighbouring
Liberia, has spearheaded efforts to return Kabbah to power.
</P>
<P>
Sierra Leone's neighbours decided in Guinea on June 26 to
pursue dialogue and economic sanctions to try to persuade the
Sierra Leonean military junta to reinstate Kabbah, but they
retained a military option.
</P>
<P>
Cote d'Ivoire, Nigeria, Ghana and Guinea were given the job of
holding talks with the junta and reporting back to Nigeria's
military ruler, Sani Abacha, current Chairman of the Economic
Community of West African States.
</P>
<P>
``We feel we have made substantial progress and that the
atmosphere exists for a substantial breakthrough,'' Ikimi said
after Thursday's talks. He held separate talks with members of
the Sierra Leonean delegation before Friday's session, reports
said.
</P>
<P>
Liberia holds presidential elections on Saturday to end seven
years of civil war and Ikimi and the other foreign ministers
planned to be there.
</P>
<P>
Nigerian soldiers have clashed with Sierra Leonean troops and
their rebel allies on several occasions since Nigerian gunboats
bombarded the capital on June 2.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopian Prosecutor on Trial of Former Govt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, July 18 (Xinhua) -- the trial of the former
government officials and their followers is one of the main
manifestations of the task to ensure the accountability of
governments to the law and the public, an official said today.
</P>
<P>
According to the Ethiopian News Agency, the remarks were made
by Ethiopian Chief Prosecutor Girma Wakjira when he spoke to
local journalists here.
</P>
<P>
Girma said, ''this activity is an unprecedented venture in the
history of Ethiopia and a task that must be undertaken to ensure
that the atrocities committed under the previous government will
never be repeated again in the country.''
</P>
<P>
The trial also serve as a forum to draw lessons on legality,
human rights and the democratic process, and a lesson to
government officials as well so that they can no more commit
crimes with immunity, he noted.
</P>
<P>
The chief prosecutor said the recent resolution by the House
of People's Representatives to strip off the parliamentary
immunity of two of its members, suspected of involvement in the
atrocities of the former government, is an important measure to
ensuring accountability and responsibility of government
officials for their actions.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, it is a big reward to those of us at the special
prosecutors office, and a clear indication of the government's
commitment to the administration of justice, he added.
</P>
<P>
The trial of former government officials started in December,
1994. Forty-five former government officials were brought into
dock. These defendants are accused of genocide and crimes against
humanity.

<HEADLINE> Canada Loses Heavily in Salmon War </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, July 18 (Xinhua) -- Canadian fishermen are taking
heavier losses than the Americans in the Pacific salmon war,
said reports today.
</P>
<P>
Fishermen of the U.S. state of Alaska are carrying out an
unprecedented interception of Canada-bound fish on the northern
coast, said Glen Clark, premier of the Canadian province of
British Columbia (B.C.).
</P>
<P>
The Alaskans could catch 10 times their limit of Canadian
sockeye by the end of the month, leaving B.C. fishermen with
reduced catch limits, the premier said.
</P>
<P>
Clark said he was appalled to learn that Alaska is catching an
unprecedented number of Canadian sockeye.
</P>
<P>
Fishermen from the U.S. state have already caught 400,000
Canadian sockeye, despite a limit of 120,000. The number is
expected to reach 1 million by August.
</P>
<P>
"This clearly escalates the dispute far beyond what many people
thought," Clark was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
"It is the first time they've been up front about the fact that
this is a full-scale fish war and that they're determined to
violate every conservation principles," he said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Since the salmon dispute broke out between Canada and the
United States four years ago, both countries have stuck by the
provisions of the Pacific Salmon Treaty, even though they could
not agree on how to renew it.
</P>
<P>
And the sockeye limit in northern waters is part of the treaty
still in place, said an international advisory with Canada's
Fishery Department.
</P>
<P>
"This year, they've obviously gone bananas," he said of Alaskan
fishermen.
</P>
<P>
As a result of the huge Alaskan fishery, Canada will be forced
to reduce the number of sockeye B.C. fishermen could catch.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, Clark called again on the Canadian federal
government to come up with a strategy with the province to do
something about the salmon war.

LAGOS, July 18 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's Foreign Minister has
raised hope of a breakthrough in the on-going talks in Abidjan,
Cote d'Ivoire, between the Sierra Leone military government and
the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS).
</P>
<P>
"We feel that we have made substantial progress and that the
atmosphere exists for us to make a substantial breakthrough," Tom
Ikimi was quoted by the New Agency of Nigeria as saying after the
initial meeting of the two sides on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
He described the atmosphere of the five-hour meeting as
"cordial, friendly and brotherly", saying that the dialogue has
enriched the knowledge of both sides on the issues that led to
the May 25 coup which toppled elected president Ahmed Tejan
kabbah.
</P>
<P>
Participating in the talks in Abidjan on the ECOWAS side were
the foreign ministers of Ghana, Guinea and Cote d'Ivoire, besides
Tom Ikimi.
</P>
<P>
Paolo Bamgura, the foreign minister of Major Johnny Koromah's
military government led the Sierra Leonean delegation.
</P>
<P>
The meeting resumed today, but the result is not immediately
known.
</P>
<P>
ECOWAS has threatened to use sanctions and military forces to
restore the legitimate government of President Kabbah, if the
current dialogue fails to achieve this goal.

<HEADLINE> 30,000 Bosnian Refugees Repatriated From Germany </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, July 18 (Xinhua) -- More than 30,000 Bosnian refugees
were repatriated from Germany in the first six months of 1997, the
office of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) said here
today.
</P>
<P>
According to the UN refugee agency, a total of 60,000 Bosnian
refugees have returned home from Germany since the signing the
Dayton peace accords in December 1995.
</P>
<P>
Germany has taken in about 350,000 Bosnian refugees since 1992,
far more than any other European countries.
</P>
<P>
Uneasy with the heavy financial burden of hosting refugees,
estimated at 3 billion U.S. dollars a year, German local
authorities have mounted increasing pressure on the refugees to
return home voluntarily. Otherwise, they could face deportations.
</P>
<P>
But Germany's repatriation plans have met with strong protests
from refugees, especially Bosnian Muslims whose homes lie in what
are now areas controlled by Serbs.
</P>
<P>
The United States has also called on Germany not to repatriate
Bosnian refugees who are unable to return home for fear of ethnic
violence.
</P>
<P>
Declaring that Bonn needs no advice on how to deal with
refugees, German officials stressed that since the fighting has
stopped, Bosnian refugees should return home to participate in the
rebuilding of their country, just as Germans did after World War
II.

<P>
MOGADISHU, July 18 (Xinhua)-- Religious leader Sheikh Ali
Sheikh Mohamud (Sheikh Ali Dhere), arrived here this afternoon
after over two months' stay in Saudi Arabia and pledged to
restore the Islamic sharia law and order in north Mogadishu.
</P>
<P>
Arriving on a small Cesna plane at the Issaley airstrip, 15 km
north of Mogadishu, the Sheikh was welcomed by hundreds of
cheering people with placards urging the implementation of the
sharia laws.
</P>
<P>
The religious leader was then escorted by about 30 battle
wagons and more than 300 armed militiamen to the main streets of
north Mogadishu. Hundreds of sympathizers of the sharia law
gathered at the playing ground of Karan where the Sheikh made a
speech.
</P>
<P>
Sheikh Mohamud said he has returned to his people so as to
restore the rule of the Islamic law in north Mogadishu. He also
promised the people that the Islamic sharia courts will be
revived and the bandits will be dealt with severely.
</P>
<P>
According to Sheikh Mohamud the Islamic sharia law are the
only means that can lead the people to a better living and real
co-existence.
</P>
<P>
The crowd pledged their support to the Sheikh and the
implementation of the sharia law, before dispersing peacefully
with a hope that security matters will be straightened up.
</P>
<P>
The Sheikh also thanked the people and consoled them for the
hard times they've been living during the period when the Islamic
courts had been dormant.
</P>
<P>
The arrival of the Islamic leader came at a time when the
security situation of north Mogadishu is almost out of control.
Killing of innocent people, abduction and widespread banditry
activities in broad day light have been very common in the
streets of north Mogadishu controlled by the faction led by Ali
Mahdi Mohamed.
</P>
<P>
The security of north Mogadishu went out of hand when Ali
Mahdi issued a decree sacking Sheikh Mohamud from the
chairmanship of the Islamic courts in October last year.
</P>
<P>
One-third of the young men are carrying assault rifles with
them in the streets of north Mogadishu nowadays. Every vehicle
is driven with at least two guns for its protection from
freelance looters.
</P>
<P>
Armed confrontations between supporters of Ali Mahdi and
Sheikh Mohamud had claimed several lives before the Sheikh flew
to Saudi Arabia two months ago.
</P>
<P>
However, a mediation by the elders from the Abgal Clan where
both men belong to, had resulted in the renomination of Sheikh
Muhamud to his former post.
</P>
<P>
At the moment,it is not yet clear whether Sheikh Muhamud will
succeed in his new attempts to restore the rule of the sharia
law, but the people of north Mogadishu are fed up with insecurity
in their part of the capital.

<HEADLINE> Cargo Traffic Down in Tanzania's Tanga Port </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, July 18 (Xinhua) -- Cargo traffic at Tanga
Port, north of here, has fallen by more than half the capacity
after the major factories in the region were closed down or
reduced their operation over the past few years.
</P>
<P>
Talking at a workshop on privatization and commercialization
of Tanzania Harbors Authority (THA) held here today, Tanga Port
Manager Idi Mkwata said at the beginning of this decade the
maximum tonnage at Tanga Port was barely 130,000 tons compared to
500,000 tons per year in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
The port manager disclosed that the number of ships anchored
at the port has declined from 10 to 6 ships per month.
</P>
<P>
He said the fall of production in some industrial sectors in
the region such as the Tanga Fertilizer Company, Tanga Steel
Rolls Company and Sigh Saw Mills which accounted for large
percentage of cargos at the port caused the decline on traffic in
Tanga.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Tanzania Bans Bikini in Beauty Contests </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, July 18 (Xinhua) -- The Tanzania government
insists on a ban on bikini in beauty contest in the country, an
official from the Ministry of Education and Culture told Xinhua
today.
</P>
<P>
The official quoted Juma Athuman Kapuya, minister of Education
and Culture as saying recently that his ministry will not
tolerate behaviors which break morality and ethics of the
society.
</P>
<P>
"Our decision to ban the use of bikinis still stands," said
Kapuya, adding, "we are not ready to allow our girls walking half
naked only to satisfy the interests of a few."
</P>
<P>
The minister insisted that cultural values should be upheld in
all beauty contests staged in Tanzania to avoid the influence of
external cultures intended to ruin the nation morally.
</P>
<P>
He said beauty pageants are allowed in so far as they promote
and portray good values of some traditions.
</P>
<P>
"We cannot imitate other cultures now in decay," Kapuya
stressed.
</P>
<P>
Miss Tanzania, the first beauty contest in the country, was
held in the capital city of Dar es Salaam in 1994, which has been
followed by many beauty pageants.
</P>
<P>
However, even now some people are still lack of enthusiasm
about the contests due to the government's insistence on banning
bikinis at the events.

<HEADLINE> Challenges Ahead for Liberia's New Government </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, July 18 (Xinhua) -- As all is ready for tomorrow's
election in Liberia, the international community has turned its
eyes to the challenges ahead of the incoming democratic
government of the war-ravaged country.
</P>
<P>
The main task, according to observers, would be the
reconstruction of the country, economic recovery, national
reconciliation and re-establishment of security.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank, in its 1997 report which reached here today,
stressed the need for greater caution with special attention to
the distortions in the economy brought about by the conflict and
the encouragement of private investment.
</P>
<P>
"Policies to spur the private sector's recovery should
therefore avoid overly aggressive increase in taxation and should
stress the early sequencing of investment-sensitive reforms such
as low inflation, and restraint in revenue collection," it said.
</P>
<P>
However, the report warned that avoiding aggressive revenue
collection does not mean offering overly generous tax incentives
for private foreign investment.
</P>
<P>
Such investment could be counter-productive as it would not
only deprive the government of substantial revenue but also slow
the revival of domestic investment, it added.
</P>
<P>
Although the west African peace-keeping force, ECOMOG, has
tightened security for the coming election, it will still be a
tough challenge for the new government to maintain security
following the withdrawal of ECOMOG six months after the
government is installed in early August.
</P>
<P>
The election will put an end to the seven-year civil war in
Liberia, but it does not lead automatically to the end of
insecurity, observers said.
</P>
<P>
Fear of violence or theft might actually increase, giving rise
to more opportunities for criminal activities, the World Bank
report predicted.
</P>
<P>
The bank also called for efforts to strengthen Liberia's local
police force and the need to tighten the enforcement of criminal
laws and other measures to reduce the risk of banditry and
criminal enterprise.
</P>
<P>
With more than 20 tribes in the country, the new government
should also take special consideration of their various interests
so as to achieve national reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
Contradictions among rival tribes are one of the root causes
of the prolonged turbulence in the country.
</P>
<P>
All the presidential aspirants of Liberia's 13 political
parties have promised hope of education, jobs and equal
opportunity for all during their campaign exercise.
</P>
<P>
Awaiting one of the candidates who is to become the president
after the election however, is how to turn the promise into
reality.

<HEADLINE> Opposition Leaders Accused of Hijacking Reform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, July 18 (Xinhua) -- Kenya's three Opposition leaders
this evening accused some of their colleagues of hijacking the
reform dialogue to be held next week between President Daniel
arap Moi and Opposition leaders.
</P>
<P>
In a joint statement issued here this evening, Ford-Kenya
Chairman Michael Wamalwa, Democratic Party Chairman Mwai Kibaki
and the Ford-Asili Secretary General stressed that no more blood
should be shed as a result of the breakdown in dialogue.
</P>
<P>
Opposition Ford-Asili Chairman Kenneth Matiba and National
Development Party Chairman Raila Odinga this afternoon criticized
the recent meeting between Moi and the official Opposition leader
Wamalwa.
</P>
<P>
They alleged that Wamalwa's visit to the State House in
Nairobi was personal and did not reflect the general feeling of
the entire Opposition.
</P>
<P>
The Ford-Kenya chief defended himself tonight at a press
conference#,saying that he did act in his official capacity.
</P>
<P>
Wamalwa reiterated that dialogue is the only way to avoid more
bloodshed in the east African country and those intended to
hijack the reform dialogue should think twice.
</P>
<P>
Matiba and Odinga declared that they would not participate in
the proposed meeting between the Kenyan head of state and
Opposition leaders.
</P>
<P>
They claimed that the proposal made by the ruling Kenya
African National Union (KANU) to have the current parliament to
repeal or amend some acts in Kenya's Constitution is inadquate.
</P>
<P>
KANU National Executive Council Thursday proposed that the
Kenyan parliament pass a bill for 11 controversial laws to be
"repealed or amended where deemed necessary" before the coming
General Elections and to set up a commission to review Kenya's
constitution.
</P>
<P>
Observers here noted that as events in the Opposition camp
unfold, whether the meeting between Moi and Opposition leaders
will take off at due time remains to be seen.

</P>
<P>
Delegates from 160 countries agreed during the five-day meeting
on a "Declaration on Adult Education" and an "Agenda for the
Future".
</P>
<P>
The Agenda, adopted at the close of the conference, calls for

Meanwhile, the Agenda addresses the educational needs of
minorities and native people as well as senior citizens and the
handicapped.
</P>
<P>
UNESCO member countries pledged to report regularly on the
progress in implementing their educational goals.

a key role in putting the idea of adult education squarely on the
political agenda of countries around the world. "
</P>

<HEADLINE> Minimum Reforms to Be Approved in Kenya's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, July 18 (Xinhua) -- President Daniel arap Moi today
said a minimum reform proposal by the ruling Kenya African
National Union (KANU) would be debated and approved at the
current session in parliament.
</P>
<P>
The Kenya Television Network (KTN) tonight quoted president
Moi as making the remarks at a mass rally at Molo, about 170
kilometers northwest of Nairobi.
</P>
<P>
Moi said Opposition leaders in the country had been asking for
minimum constitutional reforms before the General Election to be
held later this year.
</P>
<P>
"I have agreed, I have agreed fully, parliament will debate
and enact them," he said, adding that "after these, a commission
will review the entire constitution. I have always said there was
a need for changes in our constitution. Changes that will make
the lives of all Kenyans better."
</P>
<P>
The National Executive Council of the ruling KANU chaired by
Moi Thursday proposed that the current parliament pass a bill for
11 controversial laws to be repealed or amended where deemed
necessary before the forthcoming elections.
</P>
<P>
The KANU proposal aroused mixed reactions from Opposition
leaders, some of whom doubt that the government is really moving
to meet their demands.
</P>
<P>
The opposition National Convention Executive Council Thursday
vowed to push ahead with mass actions in July and August, which
includes a nationwide strike on August 8 to paralyze business
activities in the country.
</P>
<P>
However, some other Opposition leaders insisted that dialogue
is the only way to avoid further bloodshed witnessed by the east
African country during the past several weeks.

<HEADLINE> 14 Nuclear Safety Projects Completed in Russia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, July 17 (Xinhua) -- The Russian Rosenergoatom Nuclear
Corporation completed 14 international projects worth nine million
US dollars to guarantee safety at Russian nuclear power stations
in the first half of 1997, the Interfax news agency reported on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
It was said that the corporation plans to draw a total of 50 to
55 million US dollars in foreign investments for the purpose this
year.
</P>
<P>
Interfax cited Anatoly Kirichenko, vice president of the
corporation, as saying the biggest grants decided on between
January-June were 44 million US dollars from the U.S. safety and
other programs. Moreover, Western countries are expected to offer
5-8 million US dollars under bilateral agreements.
</P>
<P>
Kirichenko said that a total of 25 nuclear safety projects are
to be carried out in Russia this year with Western funding.
</P>
<P>
The measures Rosenergoatom took to increase nuclear safety last
year were worth 54 million US dollars, when Western companies
delivered equipment worth 44 million US dollars and technologies
worth 10 million US dollars.
</P>
<P>
Kirichenko said this year under bilateral agreements France
decided on a 24.5 million US dollars quota for Russian nuclear
safety. The money will be allotted within 2-3 years. Besides,
several million dollars will be invested in the Russian energy
industry in five years in the framework of agreements with
Germany.
</P>
<P>
The United States is taking part in 46 Russian nuclear safety
projects worth 98 million US dollars and decided this year to
invest in 10 new ones worth 11 million US dollars.
</P>
<P>
It is known that Rusenergoatom is currently involved in 12
international nuclear safety programs. In Russia 420 projects

<P>
UNITED NATIONS, July 18 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan today welcomed the news of the seven arrests in Kenya, said
a statement by the spokesman's office.
</P>
<P>
The seven persons, including Jean Kambanda, the Prime Minister
of the Interim Government of the Republic of Rwanda during the
massacres of April 1994, were arrested in Nairobi on July 18, 1997
by the Kenya authorities at the request of the United Nations
International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda(ICTR) in an operation
code named "NAKI" standing for Nairobi-Kigali.
</P>
<P>
In the statement, Annan said the seven arrests demonstrated the
determination of the international community to bring to justice
those accused of perpetrating some of the worst crimes known to
mankind.
</P>
<P>
The Secretary-General reiterated the justice and peace were
indivisible, and that without justice, healing could not begin.

<HEADLINE> Bell Canada to Cut 2,200 More Jobs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, July 18 (Xinhua) -- Bell Canada has announced it plans
to cut 2,200 more jobs this year to deal with tough competition in
Canada's long-distance market.
</P>
<P>
Bell Canada, the country's largest telephone company, has lost
a 33-percent share of the 8 billion Canadian dollars long-distance
market since competition was introduced in 1992.
</P>
<P>
Two-thirds of the 2,200 reductions will be from management
ranks, and the rest from administrative support workers, said
Bell's president John McLennan.
</P>
<P>
"We are facing market and price pressures from competitors who
are intensifying their efforts at a much faster pace than
expected," McLennan was quoted as saying by reports today.
</P>
<P>
Bell is in the third and final year of a massive 1.7 billion
dollar restructuring program, which was intended to reduce its
work force by 25 percent.
</P>
<P>
With this latest move, Bell hopes to reduce its work force to
38,100 by the end of December, down from 44,895 at the end of
1996.

<HEADLINE> EU Withdraws Grant for Italian SMEs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, July 18 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU)'s
executive body, the European Commission, has decided to withdraw a
grant of 6.5 million ECUs (about 8.5 million U.S. dollars) for
Italy's small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in 1992.
</P>
<P>
The EU's global grant was approved for the creation and
development of the SMEs in Italy. The decision was taken because
the grant was not put into action, sources said here Friday.
</P>
<P>
The agency administering the money, Finanziaria Meridionale
SpA, was reportedly not capable of providing the Ministry of
Treasury with a bank guarantee to cover the risks linked to the
administration of the grant.
</P>
<P>
With this action, the EC wants to show its determination to
protect the financial interests of the EU, says a press release
issued in Brussels Friday.
</P>
<P>
The withdrawal of funding is not necessarily linked to fraud or
irregularities but might be also due to technical difficulties or
operating problems which might arise during the implementation of
a project, an EU spokesman explained.

<HEADLINE> EU Requests Consultations on India Import Restrictions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, July 18 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) today
presented a formal request for consultations with India on its
import restrictions following the breakdown of multilateral
consultations in the World Trade Organization (WTO).
</P>
<P>
The request concerns the removal of Indian import restrictions
introduced for the purpose of balance of payments, said a press
release issued here Friday.
</P>
<P>
The EU expressed its regret that the Balance of Payments
Committee of the WTO had failed to reach a consensus on the issue.
</P>
<P>
It held out hope that the requested consultations would help
find agreement between India and its main trading partners on the
phasing out of import restrictions without the establishment of a
panel being necessary.
</P>
<P>
India has maintained import restrictions on a large number of
products covering most sectors of the economy for nearly 40 years.
For a number of years, these measures were justified for balance
of payments purposes and India's trading partners have therefore
accepted their maintenance under WTO rules.
</P>
<P>
The EU presented the request against the backdrop that India's
balance of payments has improved considerably since the beginning
of this decade, and that import restrictions are no longer
justified for reasons of balance of payments.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Reaffirms Stand against Hun Sen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 18 (Xinhua) -- The United States on Friday
reaffirmed its stand against Cambodia's Co-Prime Minister Hun Sen
on the eve of U.S. special envoy Stephen Solarz takes his Asian
trip on a mission to resolve the Cambodia crisis.
</P>
<P>
"The fact that Mr Hun Sen has illegally and unfairly usurped
the power of the democratically elected authorities, the fact that
he has tried to intimidate Prince (Norodom) Ranariddh from not
returning to Cambodia, the fact that he is trying to install the
Cambodian foreign minister into the position of first prime
minister, all without any recourse to democratic procedures, is
very disturbing to us," State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns
said at a regular briefing.
</P>
<P>
Solarz, at the request of Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright, will fly to Asia on Saturday in an effort to rally
support for the U.S. position from Asian governments. He will hold
talks with leaders of visiting countries, including Hun Sen.
</P>
<P>
Hun Sen, who has ousted Ranariddh as the first prime minister
by force early this month, said on Thursday that he accepted
Foreign Minister Ung Huot to take the place of Ranariddh as the
first prime minister.
</P>
<P>
But Burns said Ranariddh is still the first prime minister of
Cambodia, "the Cambodian people put his there."
</P>
<P>
"We're not willing to concede that we should do nothing when
democracy has been flouted so brazenly by Hun Sen in Cambodia," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Reports said that Ranariddh had conceded in Thailand that his
forces were no match for Hun Sen's and agreed to call of armed
resistance to his rival.
</P>
<P>
And Solarz's mission seemed inclined more th a "post-coup
strategy" than to restoring Cambodia's ruptured coalition
government, observers said.
</P>
<P>
However, Burns said Solarz's mission is more than listening
to the views of the leaders he is going to meet, but "to put
forward a very vigorous point of view by the United States that
the status quo cannot be tolerated."

<HEADLINE> Canada Protests to U.S. Over Salmon Dispute </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, July 18 (Xinhua) -- The Canadian government today
accused the United States of breaking the Pacific Salmon Treaty
between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Ottawa has sent a sternly worded diplomatic note to Washington,
which says Americans are violating international laws and demands
the Alaskan salmon fishery end immediately to preserve
Canadian-bound sockeye stocks.
</P>
<P>
"We are not sending them a letter... We are sending a note to
the government of the United States saying you are now in breach
of an international treaty," Canadian Foreign Affairs Minister
Lloyd Axworthy was quoted as saying today by reports.
</P>
<P>
Alaskan fishermen have caught at least three times the limit of
sockeye permitted under the old Pacific Salmon Treaty, charged
Canadian Fisheries Minister David Anderson.
</P>
<P>
Earlier reports said that Canadian fishermen are taking heavier
losses than the Americans in the ongoing Pacific salmon war.
</P>
<P>
U.S. fishermen of Alaska state are carrying out an
unprecedented interception of Canada-bound fish on the northern
coast, according to Glen Clark, premier of the Canadian province
of British Columbia (B.C.).
</P>
<P>
The Alaskans could catch 10 times their limit of Canadian
sockeye by the end of the month, leaving B.C. fishermen with
reduced catch limits, the premier said.
</P>
<P>
Clark said he was appalled to learn that Alaska is catching an
unprecedented number of Canadian sockeye.
</P>
<P>
Fishermen from the U.S. state have already caught 400,000
Canadian sockeye, despite a limit of 120,000. The number is
expected to reach one million by August.
</P>
<P>
"This clearly escalates the dispute far beyond what many people
thought," Clark was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
"It is the first time they've been up front about the fact that
this is a full-scale fish war and that they're determined to
violate every conservation principles," he said.
</P>
<P>
The premier believed that it's time for Canada to retaliate.
</P>
<P>
Since the salmon dispute broke out between Canada and the
United States four years ago, both countries have stuck by the
provisions of the Pacific Salmon Treaty, even though they could
not agree on how to renew it.
</P>
<P>
And the sockeye limit in northern waters is part of the treaty
still in place, said an international advisory with Canada's
Fishery Department.
</P>
<P>
"This year, they've obviously gone bananas," he said of Alaskan
fishermen.
</P>
<P>
As a result of the huge Alaskan fishery, Canada will be forced
to reduce the number of sockeye B.C. fishermen could catch.

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, July 18 (Xinhua) -- New York stocks pulled back
sharply Friday, erasing most of the week's gains, as a
surprisingly higher consumer confidence report scared away some
investors.
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average fell 130.31 to 7,890.46,
leaving the market the busiest week in Wall Street history. The
Dow surpassed 8,000 Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Bonds stumbled in Friday morning after a University of Michigan
report unexpectedly revealed a sharp improvement in consumer
sentiment during the first half of July. Interest rates edged a
little higher, but remained near their lows for the year.
</P>
<P>
Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 7-to-3 margin on
the New York Stock Exchange, where volume was very heavy again at
585.61 million shares. For the week, about 2.96 billion shares
were traded on the NYSE, and some 3.66 billion were traded on the
Nasdaq Stock Market, the biggest tallies ever for both markets.
</P>
<P>
The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock list fell 16.31 to 915.30, the
NYSE composite index fell 6.99 to 475.97, and the American Stock
Exchange composite index fell 3.75 to 633.59, putting all three
measures into negative territory for the week.
</P>
<P>
The technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index, which had gained
nearly 10 percent during a 10-session streak through Wednesday,
fell 20.86 to 1,547.99, but finished the week with a gain of
45.37.

<HEADLINE> Irish PM Ahern Hails New Truce in Northern Ireland </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 19 (Xinhua) -- Irish Prime Minister Bertie Ahern
said in Dublin today that the new ceasefire, declared by the Irish
Republican Army (IRA), would provide a fresh opportunity of
building "a durable and balanced settlement" to the 28-year
Northern Ireland conflict.
</P>
<P>
The IRA guerillas, fighting to end British rule in Northern
Ireland, announced this morning "an unequivocal restoration of
ceasefire" from noon on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking in an interview with Britain's Sky News, Ahern said:
"I welcome the speedy confirmation that the ceasefire has been
unequivocally restored. I know that it's the beginning of another
phase of work for us."
</P>
<P>
Ahern said he understood scepticism among Northern Ireland's
1.5 million people about the sincerity of the IRA truce after the
guerrillas broke a 17-month ceasefire in last February.
</P>
<P>
"I understand those reservations because people who have borne
the brunt of IRA attacks over the years will of course always have
reservations about this. That's totally understandable," he said.
</P>
<P>
"But isn't the absence of violence far better than listening to
news of people being shot in their beds and people being blown
up?" he asked.
</P>
<P>
On the future of the Northern Ireland peace process, the new
Irish Prime Minister said: "The political solution and resolution
of the conflict is still there to work on. But if we can try and
do that with violence not involved then it will be easier."

<HEADLINE> Clinton Expands Gun Tracing Program to Crack Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 19 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
said on Saturday he wants to focus on "locking the back door" on
illegal gun sales by expanding a program tracing firearms used in
crime scenes to 10 more cities.
</P>
<P>
"Make no mistake: Gun traffickers are funneling guns to lawless
youth," Clinton said in his weekly radio address.
</P>
<P>
Since Clinton's Youth Crime Gun Interdiction Initiative started
in 17 cities last year, law enforcement agencies have tracked
37,000 crime guns to their sources -- almost twice as many than
the year before, according to Treasury Department statistics.
</P>
<P>
For the first time in seven years, the rate of juvenile crime
actually dropped, by 2.9 percent in 1995, administration figures
showed.
</P>
<P>
But "children are still killing children," Clinton said. He
said it will take an expanded gun-tracing program, the
continuation of background checks on gun buyers and the
cooperation of Congress to stem that.
</P>
<P>
The president also urged law enforcement agencies to continue
doing background checks on prospective gun buyers, despite the
Supreme Court's decision last month to strike down the part of the
Brady Law that mandates such checks.
</P>
<P>
"To keep guns away from crime-committing youth, we must also
continue to perform background checks on gun-buying adults,"
Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
Background checks protect the "front door of a gun shop," but
it is the Youth Crime Gun Interdiction Initiative that will watch
over the "back door," he said.
</P>
<P>
A Treasury analysis of the interdiction program found that four
out of 10 crime guns recovered by police were from juveniles and
that the most commonly used weapon for people under 24 was a
semiautomatic pistol.

life imprisonment with hard labor the soldier that killed seven
Israeli school girls at Baqoura in north Jordan Valley in March.
</P>
<P>
Radio Jordan reported the five-man panel and military judges
said 28-year-old Ahmad Mousa Dakamseh was guilty of murder, but
his crime was not pre-meditated.
</P>
<P>
Corporal Dakamseh faced the death penalty during the
three-month-long trial, but the court finally handed down a life
imprisonment verdict because it thought that the soldier was
mentally unstable.

He was on charges of pre-meditated murder, but two

<HEADLINE> Russian Peacekeepers to Stay in Abkhazia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, July 19 (Xinhua) -- Russian Defense Minister Igor
Sergeyev said here today that the Russian peacekeeping force in
Abkhazia should stay on after July 31 when its mandate expires.
</P>
<P>
Sergeyev told reporters, "Russia wants peace in that region,
and certain changes for the better have occurred in the talks on
the settlement of the Georgian-Abkhazian conflict."
</P>
<P>
"I am sure that Russian troops will stay in Abkhazia and Russia
is not spending too much on the peacekeeping mission there," he
added.
</P>
<P>
The Georgian-Abkhazian military conflict broke out in August
1992 when the Autonomous Republic of Abkhazia in western Georgia
declared itself a sovereign state.
</P>
<P>
With mediation from Russia and other countries, Georgia and
Abkhazia have held peace talks on and off since then. The foreign
ministers of both sides are due to hold a further round of talks
in Geneva next week.
</P>
<P>
At the invitation of Georgian President Eduard Shevardnadze and
the Abkhazian leadership, Russian peacekeeping troops entered
Abkhazia in mid 1994.
</P>
<P>
Abkhazian Prime Minister Sergei Bagapsh told the Interfax news
agency today, "Abkhazia wants the mandate of the Russian
peacekeeping force extended and flatly rejects the idea put
forward by Tbilisi that Russian peacekeepers must be replaced by a
U.N. force."
</P>
<P>
He accused Georgia of trying to keep Russia out of the
negotiating process and draw in the United Nations and
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe.
</P>
<P>
He said Abkhazia had accepted a Russian-proposed protocol to
settle the conflict, which Georgia rejected, and would make no
further concessions. So he doubted any progress would be made in
the talks in Geneva on July 23.

<HEADLINE> Russian Military Reform to be Finalized by Autumn </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, July 19 (Xinhua) -- Russia's military chiefs are
expected to approve ambitious reforms of the country's armed
forces by the end of September, Russian Defense Minister Igor
Sergeyev told reporters Saturday.
</P>
<P>
He said the long-awaited military reform proposals were now
being finalized and would be sent to President Boris Yeltsin at
the end of September.
</P>
<P>
Sergeyev said the proposals would consist of seven parts,
covering reform of the armed forces proper and other military
areas, resources needed to carry out the reforms and the desired
state of the armed forces, the minister said.
</P>
<P>
President Yeltsin, who promised deep-rooted military reforms
last year, on Wednesday issued the first set of decrees to
re-organize the armed forces, including merging different branches
of the military, cutting the number of troops by almost a third to
1.2 million by the end of next year and cutting defense ministry
and general staff administration costs.
</P>
<P>
Sergeyev, who replaced sacked defense minister Igor Rodionov in
May, said the reforms would boost the troops' combat capability by
20 percent.
</P>
<P>
With the first 200,000 military personnel due to be discharged
by the end of the year, Sergeyev said Yeltsin would sign a decree
on financial support for the reforms by the end of July.
</P>
<P>
In spite of criticism over the decrees from ousted security
aide Alexander Lebed, Rodionov and Lev Rokhlin, head of the lower
house of parliament's defense committee, Sergeyev said "there are
no avowed enemies of reform in the army."
</P>
<P>
But he admitted that some of Russia's top military were trying
to slow down reform or change the emphasis on reform.

Iraq is now holding only 64 Iranians who are not POWs because

acts of killing, plunder, sabotage and destruction, he said.

<HEADLINE> Iranian President Stresses Importance of Party </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, July 19 (Xinhua) -- Iranian President Akbar Hashemi
Rafsanjani today reiterated the importance of political parties
for Iran.
</P>
<P>
"I assert that for a serious electoral system, the presence of
parties is an undeniable necessity," Rafsanjani stated in an
interview with Persian daily Jomhuri Islami published today.
</P>
<P>
The out-going president has championed the cause of political
parties in Iran for the past two years. But the cause has
apparently encountered opposition from religious and political
groups, including Supreme Leader Ayatollah Seyyed Ali Husseini
Khamenei himself.
</P>
<P>
In a televized debate in November 1995, Rafsanjani expressed,
for the first time, his support for the formation of parties in
Iran.
</P>
<P>
In today's newspaper, Rafsanjani said "If there are parties
whose mottos, platforms and aims are defined and whose supporters
are known, then one can better predict the outcome" in an election.
</P>
<P>
In 1981, late Iranian Leader Khomeini issued an order to
dismantle political parties. There have been only political
factions and groups in the country since then.

<HEADLINE> Kuwait to Raise Oil Production </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, July 19 (Xinhua) -- Kuwait Oil Company (KOC), the
oil production arm of the state-owned Kuwait Petroleum
Corporation conglomerate, is planning to raise its production
capacity to 3.5 million barrels per day (bpd) by the year 2005
from the current 2.4 million bpd.
</P>
<P>
This was announced by KOC board Chairman and Managing Director
Khaled Yousef al-Flaiji in his interview with official Kuwait News
Agency today.
</P>
<P>
He said that his company stands ready to develop all oilfields
as part of this future strategy although the ambitious plan
would request increase of the technical and administrative
burdens on the KOC.
</P>
<P>
Al-Flaiji said the plan covers all production areas, including
the northern oilfields near Iraqi border where a number of rigs
are at work in the four main oilfields of Al-Abdeli,
Al-Roudatain, Al-Ritqa and Al-Sabriyah.
</P>
<P>
He said production from the northern fields has been steadily
increasing, adding that the KOC also plans to boost Kuwaiti
largest Burgan oilfield's production as part of its efforts to
raise the country's overall output.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait at present has a sustainable production capacity of
2.4 million bpd and actually produces 2 million bpd of oil in
line with a quota set by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Continues Shuttle Diplomacy in Afghanistan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, July 19 (Xinhua) -- A senior Pakistani diplomat will
leave for Kabul on Monday to carry forward his shuttle diplomacy
for peace in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
"This is an evolving process and we are endeavoring to move
forward in peace efforts," Iftikhar Murshed, Additional Foreign
Secretary, told the media here today.
</P>
<P>
Murshed's visit to Kabul takes place a few days after Iranian
Deputy Foreign Minister Allaudin Broujerdi's visit to Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
During the visit, Tehran and Islamabad agreed to use their
influence to persuade the Afghan Islamic Taliban militia and the
rival northern alliance to sit together and find a peaceful
solution to the Afghan conflict.
</P>
<P>
Last week, Murshed held talks with the leadership of the
northern alliance in Mazar-e-Sharif during which all of them
expressed willingness to enter into political dialogue aimed at
bringing peace to Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
The northern alliance, based in Mazar-e-Sharif, has forwarded
the idea of setting up a joint political commission for a
broad-based government in Afghanistan while the Taliban called for
unconditional release of their senior officials including foreign
minister Mulla Muhammad Ghous as a confidence-building measure for
talks.

<HEADLINE> Cambodia's Hun Sen Dismisses ASEAN Peace Efforts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, July 19 (Xinhua) -- Cambodia's Second Prime
Minister Hun Sen has rejected outside mediation efforts by the
Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN), Indonesian
Foreign Minister Ali Alatas said today.
</P>
<P>
Alatas, who arrived in Phnom Penh today with Thai Foreign
Minister Prachuab Chaiyasarn and Domingo Siazon of the
Philippines, said ASEAN would now stop trying to promote dialogue.
</P>
<P>
"We were given quite a clear indication that...Hun Sen believes
that ASEAN at this stage should not contribute to any solution,
that they themselves would find a solution," Alatas told reporters
after talks with Hun Sen. "Clearly as of this moment our efforts
will stop," he noted.
</P>
<P>
Hun Sen's spokesman Svay Sitha said, "We think that at present
the royal government does not need ASEAN to take part in helping
solve the issue."
</P>
<P>
Foreign ministers from the seven-nation ASEAN last week
appointed Alatas as a special envoy to try and help resolve the
political crisis in Cambodia which saw Hun Sen oust his rival
First Prime Minister Prince Norodom Ranariddh on July 6 after a
weekend of fighting between troops loyal to the two men.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN also postponed Cambodia's imminent entry into the
grouping.
</P>
<P>
The three ASEAN envoys met King Norodom Sihanouk in Beijing on
Thursday and ousted First Prime Minister Prince Norodom Ranariddh,
King Sihanouk's son, in Bangkok on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Alatas said both Sihanouk and Ranariddh were in favor of
ASEAN's help in finding a solution to Cambodia latest political
problems.
</P>
<P>
He denied ASEAN was interfering in Cambodia's affairs because
it was consulting all parties to the conflict. He said he hoped
elections scheduled for next May would go ahead. Hun Sen has said
he wants the poll date to be kept.
</P>
<P>
Hun Sen was due to hold a news conference on Saturday afternoon
but later canceled it. His troops took complete control of the
capital on July 6 and fighting has been taking place in northern
Cambodia between Hun Sen's forces and those loyal to Ranariddh's
royalist FUNCINPEC party.

<HEADLINE> Bus Hijacker Overpowered by Passengers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 19 (Xinhua) -- A man, armed with a knife,
hijacked a bus in South Carolina today, but was overpowered by a
driver and some passengers and died about two hours later.
</P>
<P>
The man was "obviously unruly and he had been drinking" when he
boarded the bus carrying 25 passengers in Columbia, South
Carolina, shortly after midnight local time Friday,
Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Capt. J.C. Felder said.
</P>
<P>
At one point, the man put a knife to the driver's throat and
removed the driver from the seat and took over as driver of the
bus, said Felder.
</P>
<P>
When the bus reached Charlotte on Interstate 77, the bus driver
managed to pull on the emergency brake, causing the hijacker to
lose control of the bus, which struck a concrete median and came
to a stop, said Felder.
</P>
<P>
Then some of the passengers jumped the man and fought on the
bus' steps and overpowered him.
</P>
<P>
When police arrived, they were unable to open the bus door, and
firefighters had to pry it open.

<HEADLINE> Iranian President: Iran's Cultural Values </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, July 19 (Xinhua) -- Iranian President Akbar Hashemi
Rafsanjani has said that the cultural values in his country are
different from western ones.
</P>
<P>
"Our system, with its peculiarities...is an unfamiliar system
for the world, especially the West. Naturally our values collide
with theirs," Rafsanjani said in an interview with the
Persian-language daily Jomhuri Islami, which was published today.
</P>
<P>
"We have had and will continue to have these challenges (from
the West)," he said.
</P>
<P>
On the strained relations between Iran and Germany, Rafsanjani
said that the German government came under pressures from the
U.S. and Israel.
</P>
<P>
"I believe U.S.-Israeli pressures on German media and through
the media on the German government were the main thing that caused
this issue," he said.
</P>
<P>
"What the Germans did was a suicide, that is they were forced
to commit a suicide. It was not wise of the German government
to lose a century of friendship with Iran based on a baseless
allegation," he added.
</P>
<P>
The Berlin court declared in April this year a verdict on the
alleged involvement of Iranian leaders in the murder of four
Kurdish dissidents in the Berlin Mykonos restaurant in 1992.
</P>
<P>
It aroused a large-scale anti-German protest in most parts
of Iran.
</P>
<P>
On Iran's relations with other countries, Rafsanjani said that
Iran was determined more than ever to foster ties with the Third
World countries, especially Africa.
</P>
<P>
He accused the U.S. of putting pressure on African countries to
prevent them from cooperating with Iran.
</P>
<P>
"Now there are plenty of African countries who want to work
with us. But there are serious pressures on Africans not to get
close to us," he said.

BEIJING, July 19 (Xinhua) -- Heavy rains that started yesterday
cooled the month-long heat-stroke in Beijing, and in Shaanxi,
Shanxi, Henan and Hebei provinces by this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The rainfall will help ease the serious drought that has

Precipitation since June has been reported to be 40 to 60
percent lower than normal for the same period in previous

<HEADLINE> Aid Worker Abducted in Mogadishu </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, July 19 (Xinhua)-- A somali aid worker servig the
American non-govermental organization, CARE International, was
abducted by unidentified gunmen in North Mogadishu last night.
</P>
<P>
The abducted aid worker, Saed ADed Mohamed Firdhis, was
abducted by four gunmen near his house at Afarta Jardino junction
of North Mogadishu controlled by Ali Mahdi Mohamed.
</P>
<P>
According to local staff members of CARE International in
Mogadishu, Mohamed Firdhis has been the head of the Somali
Partnership Projects of CARE in Mogadishu where the agency handed
out several projects to other Somali NGOs to be implemented in
areas in Southern Somalia.
</P>
<P>
The staff members said that Mohamed Firdhis has recently been
engaged in water wells and canals rehabilitation projects in the
Lower Shabelle, Lower Jubba and Middle Jubba regions in southern
Somalia as his main duty. Nevertheless, they did not relate the
abduction to his routine business and spoke about no problems
Mohamed Firdhis has had with other Somali people or NGOs.
</P>
<P>
The reason for the abduction is not yet known, however sources
close to the area where the abduction took place indicated that
the gunmen headed further to the North of the capital and would
most probably ask for huge ransom for his release.
</P>
<P>
Sources close to the headquarters of CARE International in
Mogadishu also said there's an undergoing mediation between the
abductors and Somali representatives of the agency. The agency
spoke about optimism that the undergoing mediation will bring
about a solution to end the captivity of Mohamed Firdhis soon.
</P>
<P>
The abduction of Mohamed Firdhis coincides with the arrival of
the strong religious leader, Sheikh Ali Sheikh Mohamud in North
Mogadishu yesterday afternoon. The religious leader, who was
welcomed by hundreds of cheering people and about 30 battle
wagons with heavily armed militiamen, has pledged his supporters
that the rule of the Sharia laws will be restored. He told his
supporters that the bandits will be dealt with severely.
</P>
<P>
Sheikh Ali Sheikh Mohamud has been in Saudi Arabia for more
than two months after leaving Mogadishu following his armed
confromtations with the supporters of Ali Mahdi Nohamed in North
Mogadishu. He was relieved of his chairmanship of the Islamic
courts in a decree issued by Ali Mahdi in October last year, but
has been reinstated with mediation from the Abgal clan elders
which both Ali Mahdi and Sheikh Ali Sheikh Mohamud belong to.
</P>
<P>
Security in North Mogadishu has ever since been deteriorating
as too many gunmen and battle wagons wander in the streets with
no proper regulations to limit them. The people of North
Mogadishu are looking forward to what Sheikh Ali Sheikh Mohamud
will do about the current instability.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Passes On Gas Contract Draft To Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 19 (Xinhua) -- The Egyptian government has
sent the Israel Electric Corporation (IEC) a draft agreement to
pipe natural gas to Israel, reported bi-weekly Israel Business
Today.
</P>
<P>
IEC has however delayed its response pending an Israeli
government decision on the matter, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
"The government has placed us in an awkward position," said an
unnamed spokesperson for IEC management. "While we were
instructed, together with other potential buyers of gas, to
commence negotiations with Egypt, we are being prevented from
conducting meaningful and official talks with Egypt," he added.
</P>
<P>
The spokesperson said that, in the absence of an official
Israeli government decision on the future structure of the natural
gas sector in Israel, not progress can be made with the current
project.
</P>
<P>
To date, no official decision has been forthcoming regarding
the source of Israel's natural gas requirements -- Egypt or
Russia.
</P>
<P>
A delegation from Russian natural gas giant, Gazprom, visited
Israel earlier this month to discuss the possibility of supplying
natural gas to Israel.
</P>
<P>
During his visit to Moscow in March, Prime Minister Binjamin
Netanyahu said that Israel may spend billions of dollars to buy
Russian oil and gas in return for Russia's suspension of nuclear
cooperation with Iran, a country regarded by Israel as a major
potential threat to its security.
</P>
<P>
National Infrastructure Minister Ariel Sharon made a follow-up
visit to Moscow last month.
</P>
<P>
Industry observers believe that the duel will eventually be
decided in favor of Egypt, in view of the shorter piping distance
involved and the ensuing cheaper cost of transporting the gas from
Egypt to Israel.

The Changqing Petroleum Exploration Bureau has been carrying
out large-scale exploration and drilling in the
370,000-sq.km. basin, which is a major petroleum and gas producer
in northwest China, since the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
However, complicated ground conditions and the nature of the
oil-bearing strata have caused many difficulties in that work,
said Min Qi, president of the Changqing Exploration and
Development Institute.
</P>
<P>
"So scientific research and application of new technology are
always a major part of our exploration and production work," he
explained, attributing the increase in annual oil output from one
million tons several years ago to an expected 3.3 million tons
this year mainly to the unceasing development of new technology.
</P>
<P>
The use of seismic technology and geological research in the
past seven years have helped increase oil and gas reserves, Min
said, so that Changqing has 550 million tons of proven oil
reserves and 244 billion cu.m. of natural gas reserves, and has
the largest gasfield onshore China.
</P>
<P>
By the end of the century, it is expected to have more than one
billion tons of oil reserves and 500 billion cu.m. of gas
reserves, Min said.

The research institute has successfully developed technology
for extracting oil from low permeability, low pressure oil strata,
which pose greater difficulties.
</P>
<P>
"The technology used to acidize and fracture the oil layer is
the most important step of production at the oil field," said Min,
noting that after it had some success in Changqing, the China
National Petroleum Corporation decided to adopt the technology
nationwide to develop four billion tons of oil deposited in these
layers.
</P>
<P>
At present, scientists make up about 20 percent of the
employees at the petroleum and gas complex, and more than 65
percent of their research results have been used in oil production.
</P>
<P>
Changqing has also begun co-operating with big foreign oil
companies and research institutes, as well as investing heavily in
imported facilities for research, Min said.
</P>
<P>
"By the end of the century, we will raise annual oil output to
over 4.5 million tons and annual gas production to three billion
cu.m.," he said. "Of course, new technology will continue to play
a leading role in meeting our goal."

<HEADLINE> "People's Daily" Editorial Hails Inner Mongolia's 50th Anniversary </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 19 (Xinhua) -- "People's Daily", a leading
Chinese newspaper and the organ of the Chinese Communist Party
Central Committee (CPC), will publish an editorial tomorrow to
mark the 50th anniversary of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
The editorial starts by extending the congratulation and
greetings to the region's 23 million people, whose new system that
fits China's particular situation was created to solve ethnic
problems.
</P>
<P>
It says that in the past half century, under the leadership of
the CPC Central Committee, cadres and the general public in the
region have achieved a lot in the socialist revolution and
socialist construction. And remarkable changes have taken place in
the region.
</P>
<P>
The region is marked by political stability, economic
prosperity, ethnic unity, and social progress, the editorial says,
adding that those changes fully embody the superiority and
vitality of the regional autonomy system, which makes a great
contribution to the Marxist theory in ethnic policy.
</P>
<P>
The editorial says that while the whole nation is uniting
around the CPC Central Committee with Jiang Zemin at its core, the
people of Inner Mongolia should hold high the banner of Deng
Xiaoping to build socialism with Chinese characteristics to strive
for realizing the ambitious goals at the turn of the century.
</P>
<P>
The editorial notes that economic construction is the nation's
main job, and so is that of ethnic autonomous regions. Some of
these autonomous regions, the editorial says, lag behind the
national average in economic development and therefore, they face
an especially pressing task in developing their economy to bridge
the gap between themselves and other parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
"Regional autonomy system will mean nothing if the area cannot
achieve much in economic growth," the paper quotes Deng Xiaoping
as saying.
</P>
<P>
It calls for the sincere co-operation of Han Chinese and other
ethnic groups. The harmonious relationship must be cherished, and
the relationship of equality, unity, and mutual-assistance should
be further developed, the paper says.
</P>
<P>
The editorial concludes by saying that an even more prosperous
and thriving Inner Mongolia will be brought into the 21st century,
and the region will make a greater contribution to the country.

<HEADLINE> Palestinian Official Denies Israeli Charges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 19 (Xinhua) -- A senior Palestinian police
officer has categorically denied Israeli allegations that three
Palestinian policemen had been involved in terrorist attacks
against Jewish settlers.
</P>
<P>
Jihad Masini, assistant commander of the Palestinian police in
West Bank, told reporters Friday that the three policemen arrested
by the Israeli security forces on Monday night near Nablus, West
Bank, had been on an official mission for the Palestinian Criminal
Investigation Department, according to a report of JMCC, a
Palestinian press service based in East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Masini brushed off Israeli charges, saying that the Israelis
were merely trying to stop the Palestinian police officers from
pursuing Palestinians who collaborated with Israel.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat said on Friday night that the
Israeli charges were part of a comprehensive campaign against the
Palestinian National Authority (PNA).
</P>
<P>
Arafat was in Ramallah, West Bank, chairing a leadership
meeting to discuss the latest developments pertaining to the peace
process. He reportedly briefed the participants on the outcome of
his recent visits to Austria and Britain.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian leadership, which is composed of cabinet
ministers, PLO Executive Committee members, speaker of the
legislative Palestinian Council and president of the Palestinian
Natiolnal Council, also discussed recent Israeli-Palestinian talks
on the outstanding issues including the building of a Gaza airport
and seaport, and "safe passage" between the Gaza Strip and West
Bank.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian negotiator Nabil Sha'ath, who held the talks with
Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai, was assigned by the
leadership to initiate fresh international efforts on the peace
process. He flew to Cairo, Egypt today and then to Paris, France
and Brussels, Belgium.
</P>
<P>
On the Israeli charges, Sha'ath told reporters on Friday night
that the PNA had received video tape confessions of one of the
three Palestinian policemen and was investigating the event very
seriously.
</P>
<P>
Sha'ath added that the PNA demanded that the three officers
be handed over to it by the Israeli authorities.
</P>
<P>
According to the state-run Israel Radio, a senior Israeli
intelligence official had claimed that the Israeli intelligence
had evidence proving that a senior Palestinian police commander
had ordered a squad under his command to ambush an Israeli car in
West Bank.
</P>
<P>
The unnamed official said Israel had the
electronically-intercepted orders handed down from the Gaza police
chief, Brig.-Gen. Hazi Jabali, to Jihad Masini.
</P>
<P>
Israel also charged that the three policemen had been
planning an attack on Jewish settlers at Har Bracha near Nablus.
</P>
<P>
The Israel Defense Forces requested the PNA to arrest Masini,
but the Palestinian side has not responded yet.

<P>
MANILA, July 19 (Xinhua) -- Philippine government troops and
Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) rebels exchanged mortar fires
in Central Mindanao this morning despite a general ceasefire
signed by the two sides Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Philippine News Agency reported that nobody was hurt in the
latest incident of mortar shelling, which occurred in two villages
in Buldon, Central Mindanao, around 04:00 today.
</P>
<P>
Noel Detoyato, spokesman for the government troops, said 12
mortar shells from the MILF landed near government army
detachments in Garigayan, while seven others exploded in Lagpan.
The two villages have been cleared of civilians, he said.
</P>
<P>
The enemy fires came from Tumaginting, also in Buldon, he said.
</P>
<P>
Detoyato said the incident occurred "maybe because the MILF
field commanders in Buldon do not know yet about the general
ceasefire agreement."
</P>
<P>
On Friday, representatives of the government and the MILF
signed the general ceasefire agreement that would take effect on
July 21.
</P>
<P>
The two parties will resume their peace talks on July 30, but
no venue has been decided yet.

<HEADLINE> Amir: Qatar to Hold Scheduled Economic Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, July 19 (Xinhua) -- Qatari Amir Sheikh Hamad Bien
Khalifa al Thani has said that his country would go ahead with
hosting the controversial fourth Middle East and North Africa
economic summit in November.
</P>
<P>
The amir made the remark in an interview carried by today's Al
Rai al-Aam, an Arabic daily in Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
The Qatari monarch told the paper that "we firmly stand by our
commitment to host the economic summit in Doha," despite Syrian
threats to boycott the summit.
</P>
<P>
On Syria's reported rejection of the summit and its call for a
pan-Arab boycott, Sheikh Hamad said that "we fully understand
their position and respect it."
</P>
<P>
Egypt was also reported to have demanded Doha to postpone the
summit, and it would submit the proposal to Arab League (AL)
foreign ministers who are due to meet in the Egyptian capital of
Cairo in September.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Jordan and Lebanon also reportedly made clear their
indifference in attending the conference.
</P>
<P>
Among Qatar's allies in the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC),
Saudi Arabia, also a regional power broker and a key U.S. ally,
was the first to announce it would not attend the summit and urged
Qatar to cancel or postpone it.
</P>
<P>
The United Arab Emirates (UAE) said on July 5 that it would
boycott the meeting if no breakthrough in the Middle East peace
talks was made.
</P>
<P>
GCC, a regional political, economic and military group,
consists of the UAE, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Bahrain, Oman and
Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
Washington had earlier suggested that Qatar split the summit
events among several venues in the Gulf, allowing participants to
visit several of the six GCC states, diplomats here said.
</P>
<P>
But with Saudi Arabia and UAE publicly expressing their boycott
of the meeting, others are expected to follow suit unless they see
a change in Israeli policies, observers here said.
</P>
<P>
However, Sheikh Hamad pointed out that his government has not
been officially notified by any government of their intentions
to boycott the summit, "except what we see in the press."
</P>
<P>
Qatar has stressed only an AL boycott can stop the summit it
has planned to host with Israel's participation over the protests
of several Arab states.
</P>
<P>
The amir also said he discussed in depth the "dangerous"
situation in the Middle East during his recent talks in
Washington with President Bill Clinton, blaming Netanyahu's
anti-Arab policies for the deadlocked peace process.
</P>
<P>
The previous three Middle East and North Africa economic
conferences were held respectively in Casablanca of Morocco in
1994, Amman of Jordan in 1995 and Cairo of Egypt in 1996.

<HEADLINE> Malaria Kills 176 Kenyans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, July 19 (Xinhua) -- About 176 Kenyans have been
killed by malaria since the disease broke out in four districts
in the country late last month, the East African
Standard reported today.
</P>
<P>
Most of the victims had taken too long to seek medical
treatment "and were only brought to health institutions when the
disease was too far gone," Nymira District Medical Officer of
Health Morris Obe said.
</P>
<P>
Children aged between six month and 10 years old are most
affected by the epidemic, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
The situation was further worsened due to anemia and
malnutrition prevailing in the areas, said the report.
</P>
<P>
The four districts, located in western Kenya, are Kericho
where malaria claimed 70 lives, Uasin Gishu (67 dead), Nandi (21)
and Nyamira (12 ).

<P>
LAGOS, July 19 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria has agreed to let its Super

Africa's Bafana Bafana in October, a newspaper here reported on

</P>
<P>
Nigeria's Tribune quoted an informed source as saying that the

<P>
PARIS, July 19 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items
in leading French newspapers today:
</P>
<P>
Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- The leader of the political wing of the Irish Republican
Army (IRA) Jerry Adams announced on Friday that he has asked the
paramilitary group to renew a truce with the British government.
This major political breakthrough, which was long wished by the
British and Irish governments, will allow the entry by Sinn Fein
into the negotiations between the Northern Ireland conflicting
parties and the relaunching of the peace process.
</P>
<P>
-- The lifting of border controls between Germany, Italy and
Austria was decided for April 1, 1998, at a summit of the leaders
of the three countries held on Thursday in Innsbruck, Austria,
which discussed the expansion of the space of Schengen agreement
that allows free flow of personnel among European Union countries.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- The fall of share prices at the Wall Street and the
perspective of an announcement by the French government on
increasing taxes on enterprises exerted pressure upon the Paris
Bourse on Friday, whose volume of transactions fell by 2.77
percent during the trading session, resulting in a loss of 12
billion francs (2 billion U.S. dollars) which was considerable for
a Friday in July.
</P>
<P>
-- In a declaration made to the Arabic daily "Asharq al-Awsat"
published on Friday, President Jacques Chirac said that France
will present an initiative on the Middle East next Tuesday at the
Council of Ministers of European Union in Brussels, in a bid to
unblock the Middle East peace process.

<HEADLINE> Jordanian Soldier Gets Life Imprisonment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, July 19 (Xinhua) -- A Jordanian military court here
today sentenced to life imprisonment with hard labor the soldier
that killed seven Israeli school girls at Baqoura in north Jordan
Valley in March.
</P>
<P>
Radio Jordan reported the five-man panel and military judges
said 28-year-old Ahmad Mousa Dakamseh was guilty of murder, but
his crime was not pre-meditated.
</P>
<P>
Corporal Dakamseh faced the death penalty during the
three-month-long trial, but the court finally handed down a life
imprisonment verdict because it thought that the soldier was
mentally unstable.
</P>
<P>
He was on charges of pre-meditated murder, but two
psychiatrists last Sunday recommended that the accused not be
convicted of such a crime.
</P>
<P>
An assailant who suffers from an antisocial mental disorder is
globally considered as guilty of lesser charges, they were quoted
as saying.
</P>
<P>
On March 13, when Dakamseh was praying on his duty, a group of
Israeli girls on a tourist bus saw him and laughed at him, reports
said. The soldier became angry, grabbed a gun from one of his
colleagues and shot at the girls.
</P>
<P>
Seven Israeli school girls were killed and four others wounded,
including a teacher.
</P>
<P>
The same day, Jordanian King Hussein cut off his overseas visit
and went back to Jordan to look into the issue. The next day, the
King went to Israel, visited the families of the victims and paid
condolences to the family members.
</P>
<P>
Jordan signed a peace treaty with Israel in 1994.

<HEADLINE> France Disagrees With UK, U.S. Over Abacha </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, July 19 (Xinhua) -- Barely a week after Britain and the
United States said they would not accept Nigeria's Head of State
Sani Abacha transforming into President Abacha, France has
taken a different stand.
</P>
<P>
French Ambassador to Nigeria, Phillipe Petier, said Friday the
participation of General Abacha in the country's transition program
and possibility of his becoming civilian president in next year's
election is left to Nigerians alone to decide.
</P>
<P>
No country had the right to oppose the decision of Nigerians on the
matter, the envoy said at a cocktail party to mark the 208th
anniversary of the modern French nationhood in Port Harcourt,
southeastern Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
Both campaigns for Abacha as president and criticism of the alleged
move have been increasing in Nigeria recently. Abacha himself had in
an interview with Washington Times said that his decision to contest the
election would be made by his "contituency".
</P>
<P>
Based on the fact that the process of establishing political
parties in Nigeria had been "so one-sided as to guarantee that there
wouldn't be any serious candidate," Britain said it would not accept
General Abacha as president.
</P>
<P>
The United States reportedly shared the same view.
</P>
<P>
But Petier stressed that one country or continent had the right to
oppose the decision of Nigerians on the matter, and said that France
would not pre-empt Nigeria on the issue.
</P>
<P>
He also restated the opposition of France to sanctions as a means
of persuasion, saying "no one can dictate to France neither will
France do the same to any country."
</P>
<P>
He ruled out the possibility of sanctions by the European Union
affecting the participation of Nigeria's national soccer team in the
1998 World Cup coming in France.
</P>
<P>
France would at the appropriate time issue the necessary clearance
to Nigerian players and officials to the world cup, he added.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria has come under sanctions by some Western countries,
including Britain, U.S. and Canada, since its Commonwealth membership
was suspended following the execution of nine minority activists in
November 1995.

<P>
LAGOS, July 19 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria received three new aviation
trainer aircraft Friday from France, which will enable it to
restart pilot training after three years' disruption.
</P>
<P>
Shettima Abba-Gana, commandant of the Nigerian College
of Aviation Technology in Zaria of Kaduna State, said about 25 more
aircraft are expected to be delivered by various countries in
Europe.
</P>
<P>
The college has been Nigeria's major source for pilots.
However, training of pilots in the college has been stopped since
1993, when a storm destroyed its 15 planes.
</P>
<P>
Since its inception in 1964, the college has reportedly
trained at least 4,200 aviation personnel, including pilots,
aircraft engineers and cabin-crews.

<HEADLINE> Israel Rules Out Retaking Palestinian Cities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 19 (Xinhua) -- Israel has ruled out retaking
Palestinian cities as an option to deal with Palestinian violence
after conducting simulated military exercises, Israeli state
television reported.
</P>
<P>
The simulation of retaking Palestinian cities showed this
option would only worsen the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and lead
to scores of deaths and hundreds of wounded, according to Channel
I's evening newscast Friday.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu last week alluded
Israel might retake Palestinian cities as it grew tougher to
renewed violence to "make them pay a heavy price."
</P>
<P>
However, the report said, both the Israeli government and army
concluded after the simulated military games that although its
troops were capable of completing the mission, the retaking of
Palestinian cities would not be an option.
</P>
<P>
The simulation was carried out by the army a month ago in the
presence of top generals and senior officials from the Israeli
Defense Ministry, Prime Minister's office and Knesset (Parliament)
Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee.
</P>
<P>
Under the 1993 Israeli-Palestinian agreement on the
Palestinian self-rule in Gaza and the West Bank city Jericho and
the 1995 agreement on expansion of Palestinian self-rule to the
rest of West Bank, Israel had withdrawn its troops from Gaza,
Jericho, Bethlehem, Jenin, Kalkilya, Nablus, Ramallah and Tulkarm
by the end of 1995.
</P>
<P>
In January this year, Israel and the Palestinian National
Authority (PNA) signed an agreement on Israel's troop redeployment
in the last Israeli-occupied city Hebron following a long delay
and hard negotiations. Israeli troops redeployed from 80 percent
of Hebron, but has maintained control over the rest 20 percent
where about 450 Jewish settlers live.
</P>
<P>
The simulated games were conducted at a time when violent
clashes between Palestinian protesters and Israeli troops flared
in the flashpoint Hebron.
</P>
<P>
In the past months, hundreds of Palestinians were injured in
clashes in Hebron and Gaza Strip, mainly by rubber bullets and
tear gas fired by Israeli soldiers to the stone- and
firebomb-throwers.

<HEADLINE> Nicosia Rejects Proposal for Bicommunal Police </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, July 19 (Xinhua) -- The Cypriot government has
rejected a proposal by Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash to
set up special bicommunal police units to work with the
U.N. peacekeeping force in the buffer zone of the island state.
</P>
<P>
The government has also called on Denktash and Turkey to
abandon their attempts to seek recognition of the breakaway state
of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus, set up in 1983 by the
Turkish Cypriots.
</P>
<P>
This was made clear in a government statement issued today in
response to Denktash's statement Thursday upon his return from New
York about the establishment of a joint police force to monitor
the 180-kilometer-long buffer zone between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
The security of the buffer zone is maintained by the U.N. peace
keeping force in Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Government spokesman Manolis Christofides told reporters that
efforts to solve the Cyprus problem will "move on better if
Denktash gives up his policy to seek through everything
recognition of his self-styled regime," which has only gained
recognition by Turkey.
</P>
<P>
U.N. Security Council resolution 541 adopted in 1984 considers
the unilateral declaration of independence by the Turkish Cypriots
as "legally invalid" and calls on all states not to recognize
any Cypriot state other than the Republic of Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
"We have before us a specific course of action, defined by the
two High Level Agreements signed by the two communities on the
island, which provide for a federal republic of Cyprus,"
Christofides stressed.
</P>
<P>
"The Greek Cypriot side will adhere to this course of action,"
he added.
</P>
<P>
Denktash's proposal came only a few days before the 23rd
anniversary of Turkey's troops landing on the island following a
Greek Cypriot coup seeking union with Greece. The island has been
divided ever since.
</P>
<P>
To mark the occasion, six Turkish navy vessels have arrived at

<HEADLINE> Heart Disease Threatens S. African Blacks: Say </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, July 19 (Xinhua) -- Heart disease is threatening
health of South Africans, especially the blacks, local medical workers
have warned.
</P>
<P>
There will be a surge in coronary heart disease among blacks in 10
to 15 years unless active steps are taken right now, Derick Raal, head
of the lipid clinic at the Johannesburg Hospital, said in Cape Town
yesterday.
</P>
<P>
"Changes in diet, increase in cigarette smoking, increase in
alcohol consumption and reduction of physical activity are causing an
increase in the number of coronary event -- heart attacks -- in black
patients," Raal said.
</P>
<P>
He said figures from the Johannesburg-based Baragwanath Hospital
showed while there only two heart attacks in black patients per year
10 years ago, the figure had now grown to 200 a year.
</P>
<P>
Raal said like the United States where the incidence of heart
attacks in black patients peaked in the last year or two, South
African blacks have just reached the stage where hypertension and
diabetes, major causes for heart attack, is peaking.
</P>
<P>
According to heart disease experts, heart disease patients usually
have the history of hypertension, diabetes and high blood cholesterol.
</P>
<P>
Within the next few years, with the increase in cholesterol level,
the present rate of 18 people per 100,000 dying from heart attacks is
expected to increase 250 per 100,000 as in the U.S., Raal said.
</P>
<P>
"The answer is not drug therapy for everyone, which could be
horrifically expensive, but education and increasing awareness of
cholesterol as the major underlying factor in the development coronary
artery disease," he said.

<HEADLINE> Rafsanjani Attacks Turkey's Anti-Islam Move </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, July 19 (Xinhua) -- Iran's President Hashemi
Rafsanjani today attacked Turkey's army generals and the West for
conspiring the oust of former Turkish prime minister Necmettin
Erbakan.
</P>
<P>
According to today's Persian daily Jomhuri Islami, Rafsanjani
said "Erbakan and Refah (Welfare) Party were in power for a year.
But you saw how the bullies of the world did. They forced him out
of power in this manner."
</P>
<P>
The pro-Islamist Erbakan was pressured to step down as prime
minister last month amid growing demand for secularism and threat
from the military to stage a coup to dismantle the government
charged with inching the country toward Islamism.
</P>
<P>
The new government led by Mesut Yilmaz, who vowed to stick to
secularism, has won the vote of confidence in the Turkish
parliament.
</P>
<P>
Prior to the confidence vote, Iran had expressed doubt over
Yilmaz's odds of securing the parliament support. Ties between
Tehran and Ankara were strained last March when the two countries
recalled their ambassadors and scaled down political
representation to the level of charge d'affaires.
</P>
<P>
It all began in February when Iranian Ambassador to Ankara
Mohammad Reza Baqeri called on Turkish people to follow Iran's
lead and establish an Islamic country.
</P>
<P>
In a political commentary today, Jomhuri Islami accused
Turkey's new prime minister and the secularist generals of staging
a coup against Erbakan.
</P>
<P>
"Mesut Yilmaz and his backers in the military and political
camps staged a coup against Erbakan's Islamic government and
forced him out of Turkey's political scene," the daily wrote.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the recent rejection of Turkey's application for
membership in the European Union (EU), the commentary said EU
still did not consider secularist Turkey worthy of membership.
</P>
<P>
"Despite the secularists attempts to ingratiate themselves (by
forcing Erbakan out of power), the EU thinks Turkey does not
deserve to become a member," it said.

<HEADLINE> Rafsanjani: Iran Serious in Military Buildup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, July 19 (Xinhua) -- Iranian President Hashemi
Rafsanjani indicated here today that Tehran is seriously involved
in military build-up nine years after its the war with Iraq.
</P>
<P>
"Reconstruction of the armed forces is very costly. We are
doing all that," Rafsanjani said in an interview carried by
today's edition of the Persian language daily Jomhuri Islami.
</P>
<P>
"We spent all of our strategically-defensive resources in the
(1980-1988) war (with Iraq). Now we have to reach a sure
position. If, God forbid, there is another event (war), we should
be ready," he said.
</P>
<P>
He elaborated by adding "Especially since our peace with Iraq
has not been finalized and we still have POWs. The Iraqis have yet
to pay our reparations. Some of our lands are still filled with
explosives and mines."
</P>
<P>
However, Tehran's major concerns are believed to be the threat
to its national security and potential military attacks by the
United States and Israel.
</P>
<P>
The 64-year-old president warned early this year that Iran
will powerfully respond to any possible military measures by the
U.S., which he said has harbored deep malice toward Iran
following the victory of its Islamic Revolution in 1979.
</P>
<P>
To confront potential military attack by the U.S., Iranian
decision-makers have raised military budget by about 40 percent in
the new fiscal year starting March 21, 1997.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, Iran has allocated 25 billion rials (8.3
million U.S. dollars) on projects to confront U.S. conspiracies
against the country.
</P>
<P>
During the interview, the president blamed the U.S. and
Britain for existing problems in relations between Iran and other
Arab countries in the Gulf.
</P>
<P>
"The main problem in the region has to do with the influence of
the U.S. and Britain. It is not in their interests that Iran would
have friendly ties with the neighboring Muslim countries," he
added.
</P>
<P>
With regard to the Arab-Israeli conflict, Rafsanjani said "If
we and the Arabs had coordinated our actions, the politics of the
Middle East and Palestine would have been different."
</P>
<P>
When talking of Iran's ties with Saudi Arabia, Iran's arch
rival in the Gulf and in the Islamic world, Rafsanjani maintained
that Tehran and Riyadh were more inclined to have a rapprochement
at a time of stalked Arab-Israeli peace talks.
</P>
<P>
"They (Saudi King Fahd ibn Abdul-Aziz and Crown Prince Abdullah
ibn Abdul-Aziz) are naturally more inclined to talk with Iran in
the new conditions in the Middle East," he said.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Deputy Finance Minister Abdul-Aziz Bin Abdullah
al-Khoweiter, envoy of the Saudi king, was here on July 1 to
convey to Rafsanjani messages from the Saudi monarch and the crown
prince.
</P>
<P>
Rafsanjani told the daily that the messages stressed that Saudi
leaders were interested in helping make a success the eighth
summit of Organization of the Islamic Conference (OIC) to be
held in Tehran in December.

<HEADLINE> ASEAN FMs Hold Talks With Hun Sen on Cambodia Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, July 19 (Xinhua) -- The envoys from the Association
of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) arrived here and held talks
today with Cambodian Second Prime Minister Hun Sen on the latest
situation in Cambodia.
</P>
<P>
After the talks, Svay Sitha, the spokesman for Cambodian prime
ministers, said the three-hour talks were held "in a friendly
atmosphere and with mutual understanding".
</P>
<P>
Cambodian Foreign Minister Ung Huot, who has been nominated for
First Prime Minister to replace Prince Norodom Ranariddh, also
attended the talks.
</P>
<P>
The ASEAN foreign ministers, Indonesian Foreign Minister Ali
Alatas, Prachuab Chaiyasarn of Thailand and Domingo Siazon of the
Philippines, said that their mission here is to exchange views
with the Cambodian government on the latest developments of the
country's situation.
</P>
<P>
The foreign ministers also wanted to seek options for ASEAN to
help settle the current issue in Cambodia.
</P>
<P>
However, Hun Sen said during the talks that the current problem
in Cambodia is neither political nor military, but purely a legal
one.
</P>
<P>
He dismissed international efforts to end the crisis, including
help from ASEAN.
</P>
<P>
"We can solve our own problems within the framework of the
constitution and laws," Hun Sen said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the prime minister suggested ASEAN reconsider its
decision to postpone admission of Cambodia to the group, saying
"the decision was hastily made".
</P>
<P>
The ASEAN foreign ministers said at the end of the meeting that
the talks with Hun Sen enabled them to obtain more profound
understanding of the Cambodian issue.
</P>
<P>
They pledged to make a report to all ASEAN heads and foreign
ministers on Cambodia's position on the issue.
</P>
<P>
Before meeting with Hun Sen, the ASEAN envoys had also held
talks with Cambodian King Norodom Sihanouk in Beijing and the
ousted First Prime Minister Ranariddh in Thailand.

<HEADLINE> Egypt: Peace March Should Not Stop Despite Hurdles </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, July 19 (Xinhua) -- Egypt has maintained that the
Arab-Israeli negotiating process should not stop despite
hindrances and Israel's "illegal" measures that run counter to
previously-signed peace deals.
</P>
<P>
This stand was highlighted by Egypt's Ambassador to Tel Aviv
Mohammed Bassiouni in an interview with the Cairo-based Voice of
Arabs radio.
</P>
<P>
The report today quoted him as saying "The 1979
Egyptian-Israeli peace accord was not aimed at achieving
unilateral peace in the Middle East, but rather realizing a
comprehensive settlement in the whole region."
</P>
<P>
Bassiouni pointed out the ongoing Egyptian diplomatic effort is
designed to eliminate reasons behind the current stalemated peace
process.
</P>
<P>
He cited as obstacles to peace talks the Israeli settlement
policy in general and the construction of the Har Homa settlement
in East Jerusalem in particular.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli-Palestinian peace march slid into a crisis with
violence renewing in West Bank and Gaza, after Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu gave orders in March to build
thousands of Jewish homes at a East Jerusalem hillside.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians hold that the peace crisis was a result of
Israel's settlement building while Israel repeatedly charged that
Palestinian violence was the main obstacle to progress in
peace-making.
</P>
<P>
In the telephone interview with the Arabic-language radio
service, Bassiouni spoke of Cairo's diplomatic campaign to rebuild
Palestinian-Israeli confidence, and its preparations for resuming
peace talks in the region.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian ambassador met Thursday with the top Israeli
diplomat David Levy, in a fresh effort to break the four-month-old
Mideast peace deadlock.
</P>
<P>
He also hosted a meeting between Palestinian chief negotiator
Nabil Shaath and Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai to
narrow their difference concerning the building of an airport in
Gaza to serve the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Egypt stepped in as a main mediator for peace between Israel
and Palestinians after the U.S., sponsor of the Mideast peace
talks, apparently failed to bring the process back on track.

<HEADLINE> Bad Loans Heightens Financial Crisis in South Korea </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, July 19 (Xinhua) -- South Korean financial market are
concerned over the large amount of bad loans arising from the
chain of corporate bankruptcies this year.
</P>
<P>
A total of 22 trillion won (890 won: 1 USD) in bad credits has
been extended so far this year to bankrupt conglomerates including
Hanbo and Sammi as well as Kia corporations which are currently
under the shelter of the bankruptcy provention pact.
</P>
<P>
The amount of credits come not only from banks, but also merchant
banks and insurance firms.
</P>
<P>
"The financial market are bombarded by bad loans and the
financial system is on the brink of being brought to a halt,
causing a bad cycle of liquidty crunches and corporate failures,
said a market watcher.
</P>
<P>
He gave a cautious prediction that such a financial crisis will
have a negative effect on the economy, dampening hopes of recovery.
</P>
<P>
The virtual bankruptcy of the country's eighth largest
conglomerate Kia Group is raising doubts about the credit
worthiness of South Korean companies and financial institutions.
</P>
<P>
Among financial firms, merchant banks emerged as the largest
victims in the wake of Kia's financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
As the 18 Kia subsidiaries came under the shelter of the
bankruptcy protection agreement, merchant banks found they could
not collect on loans extended to them.
</P>
<P>
Some merchant banks even did not expect commercial banks to
apply the bankruptcy prevention pact to Kia.
</P>
<P>
At the end of may, 30 merchant banks had loaned Kia 3.9 trillion
won.
</P>
<P>
The problem is to nomalize the supply of money in short-term
financial markets, said the bank officials.
</P>
<P>
They pointed out that merchant banks are worried that customers
will rush to withdraw money from the short-term financial
institutions.

<HEADLINE> Ceasefire Reached for Sierra Leone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, July 19 (Xinhua) -- West African foreign ministers and
the military junta in Sierra Leone agreed on Friday an immediate
ceasefire in the troubled west African country.
</P>
<P>
After a two-day talks in Abidjan, Cote d'Ivoire, they also
agreed to meet again in a week's time to seek ways to return to
power the civilian government of Ahmed Tejan Kabbah overthrown in
a coup on May 25.
</P>
<P>
In a statement at the end of the talks, Nigerian Foreign
Minister Tom Ikimi announced that the two sides agreed "to
resolve all issues related to the Sierra Leone crisis
peacefully".
</P>
<P>
The meeting was held between a 14-man delegation of the junta
and the Committee of Four on Sierra Leone of the Economic
Ecommunity of West African States (ECOWAS), at the presence of
representatives from the Organization of African Unity (OAU) and
the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
The committee, made up of foreign ministers of Nigeria, Ghana,
Guinea and Cote d'Ivoire, was set up at the June 26 meeting of
ECOWAS foreign ministers in Conakry, Guinea, where a
three-pronged strategy was adopted towards resolving the crisis.
</P>
<P>
The strategy which included dialogue, sanctions and the use of
force, has been endorsed by the OAU and UN after approval by
ECOWAS leaders.
</P>
<P>
The Abidjan meeting is part of ECOWAS attempts at dialogue to
restore Kabbah's government.
</P>
<P>
According to sources close to the meeting, the dialogue
"achieved positive results under enormous pressure from outside,"
which raised hope of peace in Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Ikimi described the atmosphere of the meeting as
"cordial, friendly and brotherly," saying that exchanges enriched
the knowledge of both sides on the issues that generated the
coup.
</P>
<P>
Some soldiers launched a coup in Sierra Leone on May 25 and
ousted what they described as a corrupt government led by
President Kabbah.
</P>
<P>
The coup invited wide condemnation from the international
community, and west Africa in particular. ECOWAS peacekeeping
force, the Nigeria-led ECOMOG, has launched military intervention
in a bid to restore Kabbah's government, which put the west
African country in a very difficult situation.
</P>
<P>
The coup and the subsequent instability had increased the
suffering of the poorset people in Sierra Leone. Aid workers in
the country warned Friday that social and health conditions
deteriorated there, with more than 30,000 refugees having fled to
its neighbors.

<HEADLINE> Singapore Police Seizes 78,000 Pirated CDs in Raid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, July 19 (Xinhua) -- Singapore police have seized
nearly 650,000 US dollars worth of pirated music compact discs
(CDs) and crippled an illegal syndicate which, as was believed,
commanded half the market in pirated CDs here, the Straits Times
reported today.
</P>
<P>
It said that in its "most successful raid" on CD pirates to
date, the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) seized more than
78,000 CDs with a retail value of 940,000 Singapore dollars, or
about 650,000 US dollars, and arrested 13 people including the man
it believes to be the syndicate leader who was a former marketing
manager of a firm manufacturing CDs and CD-Roms.
</P>
<P>
In their operation, which started on Thursday and ended early
Friday, 50 officers from the CID's Commercial Crime and
Intelligence Divisions raided five places in the island country,
and captured, in addition to the pirated CDs, about 30,000
Singapore dollars (21,000 US dollars) worth of equipment used to
make "master" CDs which are duplicated at manufacturing plants,
and produce original cover designs of the CDs.
</P>
<P>
The Straits Times quoted CID director Chua Chin Kiat as saying
that the CID would concentrate its efforts on large syndicates,
because it would not be effective to hit small retailers like the
kind who run makeshift music stalls.
</P>
<P>
Music industry representatives estimate that for every three
music CDs sold in Singapore, one is likely to be a pirated CD.
</P>
<P>
In Singapore, anyone found guilty of selling or distributing
articles which infringe copyrights can be fined up to 100,000
Singapore dollars and jailed for up to five years.

NEW DELHI, July 19 (Xinhua) -- India's sea-food exports have
crossed the one billion US dollar mark for the third time in
succession, official sources said here today.
</P>
<P>
The share of marine products in India's total export earnings
during the fiscal year 1996-97 (from April 1, 1996 to March 31,
1997) was 4.3 percent and exports have registered a 27.65 percent
growth in terms of volume and 17.72 percent by value.
</P>
<P>
Fin fish is the major item of export in terms of volume sharing
45.64 percent followed by frozen fin fish (27.88 percent), frozen
cuttlefish (18.40 percent).
</P>
<P>
Frozen shrimp continued to be the major items in the export in
terms of value, contributing 65.56 percent, followed by frozen
fish (15.36 percent).
</P>
<P>
The share of items such as cephalopods (squid, cuttlefish and
octopus), chilled items and lobsters has declined while that of
frozen fish, frozen shrimp, dried and live items increased their
share considerably, which resulted in the export growth.
</P>
<P>
Southeast Asia shared 52.19 percent of India's sea-food exports
in terms of volume and 21.33 percent in terms of value.

<HEADLINE> Lockheed Martin Tops List in 1996 Defense Sales </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 18 (Xinhua) -- U.S. companies, led by
Mariland-based Lockheed Martin Corp., represent six of the top 10
companies in worldwide defense sales in 1996, according to a
Defense News survey released today.
</P>
<P>
The leading international newsweekly said in its seventh annual
survey of the top 100 worldwide defense firms that Lockheed Martin
Corp. continued to rank first in the top 100, reporting 14.3
billion U.S. dollars in defense sales.
</P>
<P>
Lockheed's nearest rival, U.S.-based military aircraft and
missile manufacturer McDonnell Douglas Corp., reported 10.1
billion U.S. dollars defense sales.
</P>
<P>
British Aerospace, plc, maintained its 1995 third-place
ranking, with defense revenue rising from 6.5 billion dollars in
1995 to 9.0 billion dollars in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Northrop Grumman, which ranked fifth worldwide in 1995, ranked
fourth in 1996, with 6.7 billion dollars; and Hughes Electronics
Corp. ranked fifth this year, with 6.3 billion dollars defense
sales.
</P>
<P>
Lockheed Martin's impending merger with Northrop Grumman will
create a giant 21.5 billion dollar defense company while the
Boeing-McDonnell Douglas merger will create a 16 billion dollar
defense firm, the Defense News said.
</P>
<P>
The report said that European companies are rebounding from a
difficult period of unprofitability, but the growth of megadefense
companies in the United States poses unprecedented challenges to
their long-term viability.
</P>
<P>
The 10 largest European companies increased combined annual
defense sales from 30.1 billion dollars to 37.8 billion dollars.
Profits of the 10 firms totaled 4.12 billion dollars in 1996, up
from a loss of 1.13 billion dollars the previous year.
</P>
<P>
The top 10 U.S. companies' combined annual sales fell slightly
from 59.6 billion dollars to 59.4 billion dollars. However, the 10
largest U.S. defense companies in the 1997 survey had combined net
income of 6.4 billion dollars, the Defense News said.

<HEADLINE> Ukraine May Delay Chernobyl Closure </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, July 18 (Xinhua) -- Ukraine may revise its 1995
memorandum with the G7 countries on closure of the Chernobyl
nuclear plant since the G7 has failed to finance the shutdown,
Environment Minister Yury Kostenko said recently.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference, Kostenko criticized a decision made by
G7 leaders at Denver summit last month to provide 300 million
U.S. dollars for constructing a new sarcophagus over the cripple
fourth Chernobyl reactor and to call an international conference
this October to raise additional funds for the project.
</P>
<P>
"By calling this conference, the G7 wants to get the remainder
of the required funds from other donor countries," said
Kostenko. "But I doubt that these countries are capable of giving
more than the G7."
</P>
<P>
Kostenko put the total cost of constructing the new sarcophagus
at 750 million dollars. He added that G7 had initially accepted
this figure but later dismissed it.
</P>
<P>
Kostenko's comments echoed Foreign Minister Gennady Udovenko's
criticism of the G7 at the U.N. Earth Summit in New York. On June
26, Udovenko said the world's industrial giants have been slow in
providing technical advice and financial aid for the Chernobyl
closure.
</P>
<P>
Kostenko said Ukraine would decide what parts of the 1995
memorandum need revision after it becomes clear how much money the
G7 would disburse for construction of the new sarcophagus and
completion of two new nuclear reactors meant to offset the closure
of Chernobyl.
</P>
<P>
Under the memorandum, completion of two partially built
reactors, one at the Khmelnytsky power station and the other at
the Rivne power station, is to be funded by the European Bank for
Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), which has however been
reluctant to commit itself to providing the required 1.2 billion
dollars, saying that the project was not economically efficient.
</P>
<P>
Ukraine has consistently vowed to finish the two reactors with
or without EBRD financing. Kostenko said the EBRD was to make a
final decision on funding for the project by mid-July.
</P>
<P>
Indicating that the current financial uncertainties could lead
Ukraine to give up the sarcophagus project altogether, Kostenko
said the government is considering plans to upgrade the existing
sarcophagus, which was hastily built in the wake of the 1986
catastrophe.
</P>
<P>
The plans involve the extraction of nuclear fuel from inside
the crippled reactor, "Leaving the fuel under the sarcophagus is
even more dangerous than a decision not to close the whole plant,"
said Kostenko.
</P>
<P>
He confirmed the government's earlier plans to restart the
first Chernobyl reactor, which was shut down last November. "Work
is in progress for bringing the reactor back on line, although the
budgetary funds allocated for this purpose are not sufficient," he
said.
</P>
<P>
The 1997 state budget approved by the parliament allocates 20
million hryvnas (about 11 million dollars) for maintenance work at
Chernobyl.

<HEADLINE> Thai Currency Further Weakens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, July 19 (Xinhua) -- The Thai currency baht further
weakened on Friday on strong demand for dollars ahead of a long
weekend, depreciating about 18 percent compared with its value
before its float on July 2.
</P>
<P>
On Friday the baht was quoted at 30.40-30.50 against the dollar
in the onshore market, falling 20-30 Satang from the morning.
</P>
<P>
The Bank of Thailand announced its reference rate for
Thursday's trading at 30.127 baht to the dollar.
</P>
<P>
The reference rate represents an average of rates traded over
the previous day.
</P>
<P>
On June 30, the last trading day before the baht's float, the
central bank's official midrate was 25.75 baht to the dollar.
</P>
<P>
With Saturday and Sunday being religious holidays, Monday and
Tuesday are made public holidays to compensate.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the central bank on Friday raised the ceiling on
term deposit interest rates offered by local financial
institutions. The commercial bank limit was raised from 12 percent
to 14 percent, and from 14 percent to 17 percent for finance
firms.
</P>
<P>
Overnight interbank rates closed at 14-15 percent, as liquidity
pressures eased slightly in the money market, with support by the
central bank.
</P>
<P>
Liquidity over the past several weeks has been extremely tight,
with interbank rates quoted as high as 20-25 percent, as capital
outflow continues amid concerns about the health of local
financial institutions and the shift in deposits between finance
companies and local banks.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, Japanese Finance Minister Hiroshima
Mitsuzuka told his visiting Thai counterpart Thanong Bidaya that
the Japanese government would work together with the Thai
government in stemming the fall of the baht, including purchases
of the Thai currency.
</P>
<P>
In April last year, the two countries signed a securities
repurchase agreement, under which central banks needing US dollars
will be able to borrow foreign reserves from each other against
collateral in the form of US treasuries. They can then use the
dollars to help stabilize their currency markets.
</P>
<P>
A stabilized baht would also benefit Japan, which is Thailand's
biggest foreign investor.

<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, July 19 (Xinhua) -- Trade imbalance between Sri Lanka
and India has increased tremendously last year, local newspapers
reported today.
</P>
<P>
The total value of imports by Sri Lanka from India in 1996 was
well over 550 million US dollars while exports to India stood at
only 50 million US dollars, leaving the trade imbalance largely in
favor of India.
</P>
<P>
During the talks held recently to examine the trade imbalance
between the two countries, both sides agreed that India should
look into the possibility of removing non-tariff barriers while
Sri Lanka should expand its product base, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
The reports quoted an Indian official as saying India had
opened its huge market for Sri Lankan products by reducing tariffs
on 81 items in favor of Sri Lanka. The official said they are
studying the possibility of adding more items to this list.
</P>
<P>
India has also agreed to help Sri Lanka upgrade its
infrastructure facilities and to boost tourism between the two
countries, the reports added.

1993, has been issued early this month.
</P>
<P>
"The move indicates that the state is determined to discourage
the growth of the tobacco industry through firm regulations and
taxation," today's China Daily quoted Ni Yijin, president of the
State Tobacco Monopoly Administration, as saying.
</P>
<P>
The new law demands China's customs, public security agencies
and frontier guards to jointly crack down on cigarette
smuggling. Local tobacco monopoly bureaux must work with the
technological supervision administrations and industry and
commerce administrations to take rigorous measures to stamp out
fake brands.
</P>
<P>
Producers without license will be forced to close their
factories and face heavy fines while their products will be
confiscated and burned, according to the law.
</P>
<P>
According to the law, illegal production and sale of cigarette
paper, filter and manufacturing machines must be stopped and heavy
fines imposed.
</P>
<P>
Each year, nearly 50 billion cigarettes are smuggled into
the country, and 50 billion shoddy and fake cigarettes find their
way into the vast market, while another 50 billion cigarettes were
produced by illegal underground factories, the paper said.

<HEADLINE> Thai Central Bank Offers Low-interest Loans to Firms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, July 19 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's central bank has
established a 20-billion-baht (667 million US dollar) low-interest
fund which could be made available to key enterprises hit by the
baht's float since July 2.
</P>
<P>
So far 13 enterprises have applied for loans from the fund,
which carries an 8 percent interest rate, to cushion the impact of
the baht depreciation.
</P>
<P>
The baht was quoted at 30.40-30.50 against the US dollar on
Friday in the onshore market, having depreciated about 18 percent
since July 2.
</P>
<P>
At present only businesses suffering as a direct result of the
baht float can apply for loans from the fund, according to
Chatumongol Sonakul, permanent secretary of the Finance Ministry.
</P>
<P>
But he said the guidelines might be relaxed to allow
enterprises which have since run into trouble to borrow from the
fund, provided they are considered important to the economy.
</P>
<P>
A panel, headed by Chatumongol, has been set up to consider
which firms are qualified to the cheaper loan.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, real estate developers in 14 southern provinces want
financial support from the government to help restore their
battered businesses.
</P>
<P>
They also request the Finance Ministry to arrange for financial
institutions to extend low-cost funding to smaller developers.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 19 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese capital plans to
absorb more foreign investment into infrastructure, housing
construction and advanced science and technology projects by
cutting administrative fees formerly collected from investors.
</P>
<P>
"Methods, including preferential policies, will be discussed
this year to encourage foreign investment in these sectors," Yuan
Zhenyu, director of the Beijing Planning Commission, was quoted by
today's "China Daily" as saying.
</P>
<P>
The State Planning Commission and the Ministry of Finance have
cancelled 48 items of fees formerly collected in the course of
construction. They include some procedural and managerial fees
which have contributed to the high cost of building.
</P>
<P>
These fees account for 20-30 percent of housing costs in some
major cities, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Investment from foreign countries, Hong Kong and Macao has been
gradually diverted to Beijing's housing and infrastructure,
tourism and entertainment facilities, Yuan said.
</P>
<P>
Construction at several housing projects, financed by firms
from Hong Kong, Taiwan and Macao, was scheduled to start this year.
</P>
<P>
Beijing has attracted investment from 138 of the world's 500
biggest multi-national corporations, and 80 multi-nationals have
established their investment branches in the city.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Concerned Over U.S. Nuclear Test </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, July 19 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian government has
criticized and expressed concern about the subcritical nuclear
weapon test conducted by the United States on July 2.
</P>
<P>
"Although the test is not covered by the comprehensive test ban
treaty (CTBT) signed only last year, basically it contravenes the
treaty's spirit and conscience"', the Foreign Ministry here said
Friday in a statement.
</P>
<P>
Such an test is not conducive to the process of disarmament,
especially of nuclear arms, for which all nations have been
waiting for so long, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
Although subcritical experiments are aimed at ensuring the
safety of nuclear arms, such tests could be used to improve
unclear arms.
</P>
<P>
With the test, other countries in possession of nuclear weapons
were being encouraged to do likewise -- a development that reduced
the CTBT's significance, it said.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia therefore calls on the U.S. government to review its
decision to carry out a series of subcritical tests, and urged
other nations to refrain from such testing.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia believes non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and
nuclear disarmament can be attained only if all countries in the
world, those possessing nuclear weapons in particular, are
strongly committed to the objectives, the statement said.

<P>
The new airport will be able to accommodate 80 million
passengers and 2.5 million tons of cargo annually. It will have
three runways -- one 4,000 m long and the other two 3,700 m each.
</P>
<P>
The floor space will be 280,000 sq. m, ample space for the
terminal to accommodate 10,000 passengers during peak hours.
</P>
<P>
Upon completion of first phase -- including construction of two
runways in 2005 -- the new airport will be able to handle 27
million passengers and 740,000 tons of cargo.
</P>
<P>
Guangzhou has become one of busiest air traffic hubs in China,

<HEADLINE> Costa Rica Cancels 700 Mining Concessions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SAN JOSE, July 18 (Xinhua) -- Costa Rica's Mines and Energy
Ministry today announced the cancellation of some 700 mining
concessions granted for their exploitation.
</P>
<P>
"We used to grant concessions to anybody, but now we want these
activities to be responsible and friendly to the environment," the
ministry said.
</P>
<P>
A controversy arose here when it was announced that some
Canadian companies would start to exploit gold deposits in strip
mines in the northern zone and the central Pacific region.
</P>
<P>
Despite assurances from the ministry that precautions had been
adopted to protect the environment, strong current of public
opinion were generated against this kind of exploitation.
</P>
<P>
Those who are against it said the strip mining would cause
negative effects on environment since it requires big amounts of
water which will contaminate adjoining terrain, rivers and seas
if not properly treated before disposition.
</P>
<P>
They also argued that this kind of mining would bring about
serious social problems, hamper the development of agriculture and
leave at the end of the exploitation a barren environment.
</P>
<P>
Costa Rica has an estimated 6 million ounces of gold in
reserve, with a market value of 2.2 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
At present, there are 28 franchises engaged in gold
exploitation in the country, mainly in the southern and the
northern central zone and the central Pacific areas.
</P>
<P>
The concessions cover an area of 127 square kilometers,
representing nearly 1 percent of the national territory.

<TEXT>
<P>
SANTIAGO, July 18 (Xinhua) -- Chilean Defense Minister Edmundo
Perez Yoma said today that the relationship between Chile and
Argentina has never been so good as it is now.
</P>
<P>
After a two-day meeting between the defense and foreign
ministers of the two countries, the two sides agreed to hold joint
military maneuvers in the first half of next year.
</P>
<P>
Yoma said that the good relations are the result of economic
integration, referring to the official association of Chile with
the Southern Common Market (Mercosur) starting in October 1996.
</P>
<P>
The Chilean minister said that the agreement on joint military
maneuvers "is a historical event."
</P>
<P>
On the southern ice areas, the two governments reached an
agreement and submitted to their respective parliaments for
approval at the end of this year or the beginning of next year.
</P>
<P>
A border dispute in the southern ice fields has not been solved
between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
In 1991, Argentine President Carlos Menem and the then Chilean
president Patricio Aylwin reached an agreement that Argentina
would retain 2,238 square kilometers and Chile 1,057 square
kilometers of the areas, but the accord has not been officially
ratified.

<HEADLINE> El Nino Affects Fishing in Colombia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTAFE DE BOGOTA, July 18 (Xinhua) -- Colombian authorities
urged fishermen to take measures to avoid a decline in their catch
resulting from the climate phenomenon "El Nino."
</P>
<P>
The weather changes in the southeastern Pacific Ocean have
reduced the population of tuna, mackerel, herring and other
species in the zone, said the National Institute of Fishing and
Aquaculture (INPA) in a communique published today.
</P>
<P>
Two ground seas occurred recently in the Pacific coast of
Colombia.
</P>
<P>
El Nino, which causes rainstorms, is a warming-up current in
the Pacific Ocean near the Equator.
</P>
<P>
Experts say that the temperature rise in sea near the coast has
led some marine species to migrate to colder high seas out of
fishermen's reach.
