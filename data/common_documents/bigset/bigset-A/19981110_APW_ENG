Three soldiers, one rebel killed in clash in East Timor
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DILI, Indonesia (AP) _ Three Indonesian soldiers and one
separatist rebel were killed in a clash in the troubled territory
of East Timor, the military said Tuesday.
	   The clash on Monday came when about 50 members of the Falintil
and pro-independence activists attacked a military post in
Manufahi, said Lt. Col. Supadi, chief of staff of East Timor
Military.
	   The rebels also took away 30 guns and ammunition from the post
that was guarded by four soldiers, Supadi said.
	   The attack was the third fatal clash recently in Manufahi, about
40 kilometers (25 miles) southeast of Dili, the capital of East
Timor.
	   A week ago, a soldier was shot and killed by pro-independence
rebels, and two soldiers and a civilian were beaten to death by a
group of pro-independence demonstrators in another clash.
	   Nobel laureate and Catholic bishop Carlos Filipe Ximenes Belo
has recently condemned the killings of soldiers and civilians by
anti-integration activists.
	   The attacks came amid rumors of riot planned to coincide with
the seventh anniversary of a massacre in which at least 50 people
were killed when Indonesian troops fired on a pro-independence
protest in Nov. 12, 1991.
	   Independent sources and rights activists claimed a death toll of
at least 200.
	   Indonesia annexed East Timor in 1976 after intervening in a
civil war that broke out during the last days of Portuguese
colonial rule, but the United Nations still considers Portugal the
administering power.

Grenada resumes banana exports after two years
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ST. GEORGE'S, Grenada (AP) _ Grenada exported its first bananas
following a two-year ban because of poor quality, and farmers and
government officials expressed their relief as the fruit was loaded
Monday onto a ship going to England.
	   ``We are quite excited. ... It was a long wait but we are back
in the export business and this is good for me as a farmer,'' said
Stephen Gludd, 47, who had resorted to work in construction.
	   The Windward Islands Banana Export Development Corp. banned
banana exports from Grenada in 1996 because of the poor quality of
fruit arriving in Britain.
	   Banana fields were inspected and some farmers certified by the
corporation before the ban was lifted.
	   Agriculture Minister Michael Baptiste said he was ``unable to
describe'' his feelings.
	   ``This shows that the government did not turn its back in the
banana industry,'' Baptiste said. ``We have been working hard to
ensure we start shipping bananas again.''
	   Prime Minister Keith Mitchell was on hand Monday to witness the
delivery of fruit on the St. George's Port, where it was packaged
and loaded onto a ship heading for the United Kingdom.
	   The collapse of the banana industry has had disastrous effects
on the rural economy.
	   The resumption of banana exports is the one bright spot in the
export of traditional crops that include cocoa, nutmeg and mace.
Lack of demand has brought down international prices for cocoa and
nutmeg.
	   Tourism is expected to become the main revenue earner in
Grenada, where agriculture has been hit by a series of natural
disasters from droughts to hurricanes in recent years, and the
arrival of the Pink Mealy Bug that nearly wiped out the cocoa crop.

Indonesian assembly convenes to cast rules for 1999 elections
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: One name only for Suharto, Harmoko is correct.

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Amid tight security and student
protests, President B.J. Habibie on Tuesday opened a controversial
government assembly that will cast rules for 1999 parliamentary
elections.
	   Leaders of the People's Consultative Assembly said they were
determined to abandon the authoritarian legacy of former President
Suharto, who quit in May amid riots and protests.
	   But hundreds of students who gathered at a university campus
rejected the meeting of Indonesia's highest legislative body,
saying it was not sincere about democratic reform. They cited the
military's prominent role in politics.
	   Inside the green-roofed hall of Parliament, House Speaker
Harmoko declared before 1,000 delegates that constitutional change
was the best way to guide Indonesia's transition to democracy.
	   ``This is actually the time for us to think clearly, so as to
prevent the euphoria of freedom from burying the very essence of
democracy,'' said Harmoko, a onetime ally of Suharto.
	   ``We are therefore confident that the people will never accept a
government formed by way of anarchy,'' Harmoko said.
	   Fears abound that political tension now will trigger unrest
similar to the riots that eventually forced Suharto from office.
Students demonstrated against the assembly on Monday, but huge
numbers of troops blocked them from approaching Parliament.
	   Harmoko said delegates will revoke old decrees that preserved
special presidential powers during the Suharto era, and would
concentrate on human rights and clean government and trying to fix
Indonesia's shattered economy.
	   ``This is no longer the time for us to give a negative response
to criticism lodged against the government,'' he said.
	   In a sign of compromise, Indonesia's military chief has said
that the armed forces are willing to discuss demands to limit their
prominent role in politics.
	   Gen. Wiranto said any decisions should be left to the delegates
at the assembly, formerly a haven for Suharto loyalists who
reelected the former president in March to a seventh, five-year
term.
	   One proposal to be considered by the assembly would reduce the
number of seats allotted to the military in the 500-seat Parliament
from 75 to as few as 25. The military began scaling back its role
in politics in the final years of Suharto's authoritarian rule.
	   Student protesters, however, say all members of Parliament
should be elected and appointed seats should be abolished.
	   Habibie, a onetime confidant of Suharto who has tried to
distance himself from the former leader, wants to hold
parliamentary elections in June, followed by the selection of a new
head of state by a newly designed assembly at the end of 1999.
	   ``We regard the general election as the best way for the people
to determine their own future in a democratic manner,'' Harmoko
said.
	   Habibie did not speak at the assembly to avoid giving the
impression that he was trying to sway the delegates. He is expected
to run as a presidential candidate next year.
	   The convening of the assembly comes as the world's fourth-most
populous nation grapples with its worst economic crisis in decades.
	   Inflation and unemployment are high, and millions of people are
sinking into poverty. Rioting and looting over price rises have
occurred sporadically for months in many areas.

<TEXT>
	   PITTSBURGH (AP) _ Kordell Stewart could do no wrong on a night
the Green Bay Packers could do virtually nothing right until it was
too late.
	   Stewart, benched last week in one of Pittsburgh's worst losses
of the Bill Cowher era, passed and ran the Steelers to a 24-point
halftime lead and a 27-20 victory Monday night that left the
Packers two games back in the NFC Central.
	   Pumping his fists and leaping with joy like a school kid on a
playground with every perfectly thrown pass, Stewart ran for a
touchdown, threw an 8-yard TD pass to Charles Johnson and set up a
third score with a 45-yard throw to rookie Hines Ward in his best
game in nearly a year.
	   And that was only the first half.
	   Stewart was 15-of-22 for 231 yards and no interceptions in his
best game since throwing for three touchdowns and running for two
in a December victory over Denver. Since then, he had eight
touchdowns and 17 interceptions in 12 games, forcing Cowher to
continually defend his decision to keep playing him.
	   Jerome Bettis ran for 100 yards _ his seventh consecutive
100-yard game on a Monday night.
	   Stewart looked nothing like the hesitant, unconfident
quarterback whose season-long slump was threatening to unravel the
Steelers' season and leave them challenging only for a wild card
spot.
	   Instead, the Steelers (6-3) _ embarrassed 41-31 at home by
Tennessee last week as Stewart was pulled after throwing three
interceptions _ stayed within a game of AFC Central leader
Jacksonville (7-2) with two games left against the Jaguars.
	   And now the Packers (6-3) are in a precarious situation, just a
week after a 36-22 victory over San Francisco pulled them within a
game of Minnesota.
	   The Packers' second Monday night meltdown in barely a month _
Randall Cunningham passed for 442 yards in Minnesota's 37-24 romp
on Oct. 5 _ came just when the Vikings (8-1) finally seemed
vulnerable. Both Cunningham and Brad Johnson are hurt and may not
play Sunday against Cincinnati.
	   But the Packers, who displayed a playoff-like intensity against
the 49ers, came off flat and overcautious, and they didn't begin
playing like two-time defending NFC champions until it was too
late.

Government suspends newspaper for criticizing Cambodian monarch
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ The Cambodian government handed down
a suspension order Tuesday to a newspaper calling for King Norodom
Sihanouk to stand trial for crimes against humanity.
	   Khieu Kanharith, secretary of state for the Information
Ministry, signed the order suspending the National Salvation
newspaper because it violated a constitutional provision
stipulating that the Cambodian monarch is inviolable.
	   In its very first edition published Tuesday, National Salvation
printed on the front page portraits of King Norodom Sihanouk and
Pol Pot and an article headlined, ``For justice, try King Sihanouk
together with Pol Pot.''
	   Pol Pot headed the Khmer Rouge regime between 1975 and 1979 that
caused the deaths of as many as 2 million Cambodians. He died of a
heart attack in the jungles last year as the dwindling remnants of
his guerrilla army fractured.
	   Sihanouk, at the time a prince, was Cambodia's ruler in 1970
when he was toppled by a U.S.-backed military coup during the
height of the war in neighboring Vietnam.
	   He lent his support and popular appeal to the Khmer Rouge, then
a little-known guerrilla force, to fight the new regime. He was
made a prisoner in his palace when the Khmer Rouge took power.
Several of his family members were killed.
	   ``King Sihanouk is the prime person responsible for the loss of
lives of more than 3 million Cambodians under the Democratic
Kampuchea regime,'' said the newspaper. Most historians consider
that figure too high.
	   ``An international tribunal should include him in the list of
genocide's criminals and try him together with Pol Pot for justice
to be served,'' the newspaper said.
	   Publisher Chhea Vary, 32, said he stood by the article and said
part of journalistic freedom was the right to express an opinion.
	   ``I don't think my article is abusive to the king,'' Chhea Ravy
said.
	   Khieu Kanharith has also issued a warning against the publisher
of another newspaper, New News, which accused the 76-year-old
monarch last week of being the founder of the Khmer Rouge regime.
	   The United Nations is sending a team to Cambodia next week to
sift through evidence gathered against the Khmer Rouge over the
past few years to determine what kind of crimes surviving leaders
could be charged with and how they could be tried if caught.
	   Sihanouk has said he supports bringing Khmer Rouge criminals
before an international tribunal.

Strong winds cause trouble for boats off the coast of Scotland
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Scottish coast guards on Tuesday evacuated some
crew from a British Petroleum oil rig and rescued a small fishing
boat caught up in violent storms whipping through most of the
country.
	   The Aberdeen coast guard, assisted by the Royal Air Force,
evacuated 30 non-essential crew from the 154,000-ton oil rig
Schiehallion, which reported damage to its bow section about 60
miles west of the Shetland Islands off the east coast of Scotland.
	   The rest of the 75 crew were staying on board to assess the
damage, the coast guard said. No one was injured, and production
had been suspended.
	   And off the west coast of Scotland, Stornoway coast guard had
attached a line to a 90-foot (27 meters) fishing trawler to tow it
to safety. The coast guard had worked more than 25 hours to get the
line secure. The boat, which lost power after damaging a propeller,
has five crew onboard.
	   Torrential rain and gale force winds have pummeled Scotland
since Monday. The storms have damaged water pipes, cut off roads
and forced the cancellation of ferries.

South Korean civic group to donate milk cows to North Korea
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ A South Korean civic group said
Tuesday it plans to ship 96 more milk cows to hunger-stricken North
Korea this weekend.
	   A 3,000-ton freighter leased from the Caribbean state of Saint
Vincent will leave Inchon port west of Seoul on Saturday to arrive
in the North's Nampo port the next day, the Good Neighbors relief
organiation said.
	   The Seoul-based group donated 104 milk cows to the North in
September.
	   Earlier this year, South Korea's largest conglomerate, Hyundai,
donated 1,001 heads of cattle to North Korea in a deal related to a
multi-million dollar tourism project in the North.
	   So far, South Korea has given North Korea dlrs 315 million in
food since the communist country turned to the international
community to feed its 23 million people in 1995.
	   North Korea has suffered dire food shortages after three years
of disastrous weather that aggravated problems caused by
inefficient cooperative farming techniques.

Human rights group criticizes civilian guards at Indonesian

assembly
 &UR; With Indonesia-Politics

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Thousands of civilian guards deployed
in Jakarta to safeguard a government assembly pose a threat to
public order, an international human rights group said Tuesday.
	   The guards are members of government-backed youth groups helping
to guard the People's Consultative Assembly, which opened Tuesday
to craft rules for 1999 parliamentary elections.
	   In a statement, New York-based Human Rights Watch said the
guards are not disciplined and many of them oppose student
activists who have been demonstrating against the assembly.
	   ``Part of the problem is that the kind of young people who
accepted the military's invitation to help with security are
precisely those who disagree with the student protests,'' the
rights group said.
	   On Monday, a group of civilian guards briefly threw rocks and
plastic bottles at students at a university campus. Police did not
intervene.
	   Fearing unrest, the military has deployed 30,000 police and
soldiers in Jakarta during the four-day meeting of the nation's
highest legislative body.
	   Riots and protests in May led to the resignation of former
President Suharto after 32 years of authoritarian rule.

Police minister: crimes rising, becoming more serious
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ Police Minister Le Minh Huong says crime
is on the rise in Vietnam in terms of volume, scale and
seriousness, with the emergence of transnational crime.
	   Money laundering, smuggling and drug trafficking have become
serious problems, Huong told the Ho Chi Minh City Police newspaper
in its Tuesday edition.
	   Huong said police forces have handled more than 70,000 crimes so
far this year, with the amount of money involved in economic crimes
growing quickly.
	   ``In the past, an economic crime with missing state funds of
several dozen million dong or several hundred million dong (tens of
thousands of dollars) was a people's outrage,'' Huong said. ``Now a
case can involve up to thousands of billion dong (hundreds of
millions of dollars).''
	   He said gangster-like groups have cropped up in the country and
that coordination of local criminals with international cohorts has
made the anti-crime drive more difficult.
	   On drug trafficking, Huong said police forces have arrested
11,000 drug-related criminals in 5,500 cases in the first eight
months of 1998, up 44.1 percent from same period last year.
	   He said rehabilitation efforts have not proven to be very
successful, with a readdiction rate of 80 percent to 90 percent for
those who have gone through treatment facilities.
	   There are 80,000 drug addicts with police records nationwide
with 70 percent aged 18-30, he said.
	   It is estimated that there are 134,000 drug addicts in Vietnam.
	   The government recently has launched a national anti-crime
program to be implemented between now and 2000.

No extradition for Chinese fortune teller accused of Hong Kong

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ A mainland Chinese fortune teller accused of
fatally poisoning three women and two girls in Hong Kong will not
be extradited to face Hong Kong justice, the government said
Tuesday.
	   Li Yuhai, a 46-year old practitioner of feng shui, or Chinese
geomancy, will not be tried in Hong Kong courts despite sufficient
evidence implicating him in the the deaths early this year,
authorities said.
	   Li was arrested in the northern Chinese province of Hubei in
September on charges he allegedly fed cyanide to the women. But
although the deaths occurred in Hong Kong, Li will be tried in the
mainland _ an issue that has raised concerns over Hong Kong's
criminal justice system one year after the return to Chinese
sovereignty.
	   Secretary of Security Regina Ip told the Hong Kong Standard that
if Li had been arrested in Hong Kong, he would have been tried
here, but that without a ``formal legal arrangement'' for such
extradition, Hong Kong will not ask China to return him.
	   Secretary of Justice Elsie Leung acknowledged last week to a
lack of clarity on the issue of extradition of criminals between
Hong Kong and the mainland, saying Hong Kong's government did not
``fully understand the law and situation'' in China.
	   Li's case _ and that of alleged Hong Kong crime boss Cheung
Tze-keung who is awaiting verdits in a kidnapping and murder trial
in China _ have befuddled Hong Kong's legal experts.
	   Some say these cases could set a dangerous precedent: Crimes
committed in Hong Kong, where no death penalty is imposed, are
being prosecuted in mainland China, where the death penalty is
widely used.
	   Because Hong Kong is now a part of China, international
agreements on the transfer of fugitives do not cover such
cross-border crimes _ even though the outcome of the cases can been
vastly different under the two legal systems.
	   Leung urged Hong Kong's legal pundits to refrain from going
overboard in their attacks on problems that can crop up as the
separate systems intersect.
	   ``What one should not do is to shake the public confidence in
our criminal justice system,'' Leung said.
	   Li will face trial in China after purportedly confessing to the
deaths of the women and stealing 1.3 million Hong Kong dollars
(U.S. dlrs 167,000) from them in July. Press reports at the time
said the the deaths were related to a religious cult, but police
have discounted that possibility.
	   The women reportedly had an interest in Chinese geomancy because
a pair of black scissors tied to a wok with red strings was found
hanging from their apartment window _ a symbol superstitious
Chinese use in hopes of warding off evil spirits.

Government: Singapore slips into recession
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: TOPS with 5 grafs RECASTING lede, ADDING quote from ministry,
definition of recession, pks up 4th graf pvs. ``The economy ...''

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Singapore's economy is technically in recession
and could contract as much as 1 percent in 1999, the Ministry of
Trade and Industry said Tuesday.
	   ``On a quarter-on-quarter basis, (gross domestic product) shrank
for the second consecutive quarter, signaling that the economy is
in a technical recession,'' the ministry said.
	   Two back-to-back quarters of negative growth is generally
accepted as the definition of a recession.
	   The government also revised the economic growth forecast for
1998 to 0.5 percent to 1 percent, down from an earlier forecast of
0.5 to 1.5 percent. It predicted the economy in 1999 will hover
between a 1.0 percent contraction and 1.0 percent growth.
	   The government said Singapore's GDP contracted by 0.7 percent in
the third quarter, compared with a year earlier. This is the first
time that the economy has shrunk on a year-on-year basis since the
first quarter of 1986.
	   The economy grew by 7.8 percent in 1997. Though the economic
crisis hit Southeast Asia in July 1997, it took time for
reverberations to reach affluent Singapore.
	   ``The external economic environment has deteriorated measurably
in the past few months,'' the ministry said.
	   ``Although some stability has returned to most Asian economies
following more signs of reform implementation ... economic
contractions are likely to take a protracted period to work
themselves out,'' it added.
	   The ministry cited the Russian ``economic stalemate'' and
problems in Latin America, which are putting pressure on investors
in developing countries.
	   Recent cuts in interest rates could help the situation, it said.
	   Deputy Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong earlier said he expects a
further contraction in the fourth quarter.
	   Detailing the economy in the third quarter, the ministry said
the manufacturing sector shrank by 4.5 percent following a decline
of 0.5 percent in the second quarter, while the finance sector grew
by 1.7 percent, down from 2.4 percent growth in the second.
	   The construction sector grew by 1.1 percent in the third
quarter, much slower than the 9.8 percent growth registered in the
second.
	   The retail sector declined by 6.0 percent after a decline of 4.7
percent in the second quarter. Transportation and communications
grew by 3.2 percent after expanding by 5.6 percent in the second
quarter.

	   HAMILTON, Bermuda (AP) _ The black-supported Labor Party swept
to victory for the first time in general elections Monday, an
outcome that reflected racial tension in Bermuda and ended the
conservatives' 30-year rule.
	   Preliminary results gave 26 of the 40 Parliament seats to the
Bermuda Labor Party and the rest to former Premier Gordon's United
Bermuda party. Labor had held 18 seats in the outgoing government.
	   Labor Party leader Jennifer Smith, who will become the new
premier, said Bermudians had met their ``date with destiny'' at
Monday's elections.

	   Turnout was 77 percent of the 36,000 voters on the island,
Britain's most populous remaining colony with 60,000 people.
	   The biggest issue was the economy, which is dependent on tourism
and a booming off-shore banking industry now threatened by
proposals for stricter regulation.
	   The Labor Party, which has moved to the political center in
recent years, sought to reassure the island's white-led business
community during the campaign, promising to ``work in partnership
with the banking community, international business and the island's
chamber of commerce.''
	   The 35-year-old Labor Party, backed by the island's blacks, had
never won an election before. Many blamed racist fears that they
would mishandle the economy.
	   Although Bermudians enjoy one of the highest standards of living
in the world with a per capita income of dlrs 36,000, some complain
of declining education standards and the lack of affordable housing
on their 22-square-mile island.
	   Drugs and crime are also causing problems on Bermuda, which
islanders still pride as one of the safest holiday destinations.

	   In Devonshire North, a largely black constituency, voters said
Prime Minister Pamela Gordon's United Bermuda Party had not done
enough for poorer Bermudians.
	   ``They won. We lost,'' Gordon said. ``We've got a lot of work to
do, and if this is what the people of Bermuda need to start the
healing process, then we need to get busy.''
	   Gordon's ruling United Bermuda Party was founded by the white
merchant class descended from Britons who settled in Bermuda in the
1600s and make up 35 percent of the population. Gordon is black, as
is most of her Cabinet. However, the party is seen by many as part
of the white establishment.
	   Most Bermudians are blacks of African descent, many of whom
support the Progressive Labor Party, led by Jennifer Smith.
	   Racial tensions dominated politics here in the 1970s and race
riots erupted in 1972-73 and in 1977.

Steelers 27, Packers 20
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: CHANGES slug from Sports-Football-Packers-Steelers, adds
quotes.
 &UR; By ALAN ROBINSON &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PITTSBURGH (AP) _ Kordell Stewart could do no wrong on a night
the Green Bay Packers could do virtually nothing right until it was
too late.
	   Stewart, benched last week in one of Pittsburgh's worst losses
of the Bill Cowher era, passed and ran the Steelers to a 24-point
halftime lead and a 27-20 victory Monday night.
	   The Packers (6-3) rallied to score the final 20 points, but were
outrushed 144-39 to fall two games behind Minnesota in the NFC
Central.
	   ``How big was this? This was huge,'' said Pittsburgh's Jerome
Bettis, who ran for 100 yards for the seventh straight time on a
Monday night. ``If we lose, we're two games behind (in the AFC
Central). This was what we needed.''
	   Especially for Stewart, who emerged from a season-long slump.
	   Pumping his fists and leaping with joy like a school kid on a
playground with every perfectly thrown pass, Stewart ran for a
touchdown, threw an 8-yard TD pass to Charles Johnson and set up a
third score with a 45-yard throw to rookie Hines Ward in his best
game in nearly a year.
	   And that was only the first half.
	   ``We haven't been coming out throwing, but we felt we had to do
it because their offense is so potent,'' receiver Courtney Hawkins
said. ``We had to keep their offense off the field.''
	   Stewart was 15-of-22 for 231 yards and no interceptions in his
most dominating performance since throwing for three touchdowns and
running for two in a December victory over Denver. Since then, he
had eight touchdowns and 17 interceptions in 12 games, forcing
Cowher to continually defend his decision to keep playing him.
	   ``Our players are not robots. We tried to tell them this man was
capable of great things,'' Packers coach Mike Holmgren said. ``He
has been faltering all season but he is capable of doing much more.
It's hard to get them to believe that.''
	   Stewart looked nothing like the hesitant, unconfident
quarterback whose poor play was threatening to unravel the
Steelers' season and leave them challenging only for a wild card
spot.
	   Instead, the Steelers (6-3) stayed within a game of AFC Central
leader Jacksonville (7-2) with two games left against the Jaguars.
	   ``It's a big game, the biggest of the season. We couldn't afford
to lose,'' said cornerback Carnell Lake, who played despite a
severely sprained right ankle.
	   And now the Packers (6-3) are in a precarious situation, just a
week after a 36-22 victory over San Francisco pulled them within a
game of Minnesota.
	   ``We tried to match their intensity but we couldn't,'' Holmgren
said. ``But there is no quit in this team, and we battled back at
the end. If we had gotten the ball back one more time, who knows
what would have happened?''
	   The Packers' second Monday night meltdown in barely a month _
Randall Cunningham passed for 442 yards in Minnesota's 37-24 romp
on Oct. 5 _ came just when the Vikings (8-1) finally seemed
vulnerable. Both Cunningham and Brad Johnson are hurt and may not
play Sunday against Cincinnati.
	   But the Packers, who displayed a playoff-like intensity against
the 49ers, came off flat and overcautious, and they didn't begin
playing like two-time defending NFC champions until it was too
late.
	   Reggie White, who manhandled the 49ers' offensive line in the
Packers' nine-sack performance last week, had only one sack, and it
didn't come until the Steelers led 27-0.
	   White upended backup quarterback Mike Tomczak on a
third-and-goal play from the Packers' 4, allowing Keith McKenzie to
run 88 yards for the longest fumble return touchdown in Packers'
history.
	   That defensive play got the Packers' offense going. Favre drove
them 74 yards for Raymont Harris' 2-yard TD run and a 2-point
conversion pass to Antonio Freeman that made it 27-17 with 4:52
remaining.
	   The desperate Packers then recovered an onside kick, but stalled
at the Steelers' 19 and Ryan Longwell kicked a 37-yard field goal
with 2:40 to go.
	   Green Bay then tried another onside kick, but Steelers tight end
Mark Bruener recovered at the Packers' 41, allowing Pittsburgh to
run out the clock and Bettis to hit 100 yards on a 34-carry night.
	   Favre's number's looked good _ 22-of-39 for 234 yards and an
interception _ but most of the yards came in the fourth quarter.
The Steelers had dominated until then, outgaining the Packers
274-72 in the first half while outrushing them 105-16.

China arrests over 140 underground Christians
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) - Chinese police have arrested over 140 members of
underground Christian churches and beat their leaders in what a
church campaigner warned is a new crackdown on worship outside
state control.
	   The worshipers were arrested at meetings in underground, or
house churches _ so-called because they often take place in private
homes _ on Oct. 26 and Nov. 5 in two separate places in central
Henan province, according to a letter from a church campaigner.
	   After jailing the worshipers, police ``cruelly beat'' at least
13 identified as leaders, and their fate was unknown, said the
letter which was dated Monday and released Tuesday by New
York-based Human Rights in China.
	   ``These two acts of religious persecution are not isolated. Even
greater religious persecution will unfold over the next two
months,'' said the letter, written by David Zhang, a self-styled
spokesman for China's house churches.
	   A spokeswoman for China's Religious Affairs Bureau, which
oversees religious police, said she had not heard of the arrests
and had no immediate comment.
	   Although Chinese leaders have shown a willingness to discuss
religious tolerance with U.S. President Bill Clinton, U.N. human
rights chief Mary Robinson and other western dignitaries, police
intimidation of house churches persist.
	   China forbids worship outside of institutions approved by the
state, in the case of Christians, the China Christian Council.
	   But as two decades of free market reforms discredited communist
ideology and loosened the Communist Party's hold over people's
lives, the number of religious believers has soared.
	   Although the China Christian Council claims worshippers number
11,000, estimates by missionaries and members of the unofficial
church run as high as 80,000.
	   While many Chinese Christians and state-ordained ministers
worship in both legal and house churches, the underground church
movement tends to be more evangelical.
	   The meetings that took place in Henan attracted followers from
all over China, said the letter released by Human Rights in China.
It gave the following account of the two incidents:
	   Police surrounded the gathering at night on Oct. 26 in Liuwan
village outside Wugang city and then suddenly attacked, taking away
the 40 people, including Han Rongqin, Cheng Meiying and nine other
leaders of the house church movement.
	   On Nov. 5, 100 kilometers (60 miles) to the northeast, police in
Nanyang city broke up a house church service and arrested leaders
Lu Lianquan and Zhang Fushan along with more than 100 worshipers.
	   Despite the persecution, ``we believe the Chinese government
will one day realize that Christianity is a stabilizing effect on
Chinese society, that the faith of China's house churches is pure
and its believers are patriotic,'' the letter said.

In wake of Suharto era, Indonesia's Habibie bound for APEC
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By CHRISTOPHER TORCHIA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ At the Asia-Pacific summit hosted by
Canada last year, then-Indonesian President Suharto was a villain
to hundreds of pro-democracy protesters. To his fellow heads of
state, he was a linchpin of their economic alliance.
	   Since Suharto quit in May, dislodged by riots and protests,
successor B.J. Habibie has shed many of the authoritarian trappings
that his onetime mentor crafted over three decades.
	   But Habibie, beset by the same economic crisis that eroded
Suharto's power and uncertainty over democratic reforms, may be
hard pushed to match his predecessor's legacy in foreign affairs. A
big test comes next week at the APEC conference in Malaysia,
Habibie's first trip outside Indonesia since taking office.
	   On Tuesday, Habibie was tied up with Indonesia's fragile
transition to democracy. Amid tight security and student protests,
a government assembly opened to cast rules for 1999 parliamentary
elections.
	   Suharto, a pillar of stability for most of his 32 years in
power, was active in launching the Asia-Pacific Economic
Cooperation forum, which held its first summit of leaders in 1993.
	   Indonesia has also played a prominent role in other foreign
forums, including the Non-Aligned Movement and the Organization of
Islamic Conference.
	   The country has sponsored talks to solve conflicts in Cambodia
and the Philippines and a territorial dispute over the Spratley
Islands in the South China Sea.
	   Suharto's record abroad as a moderate and a mediator contrasts
with the often harsh tactics with which he subdued dissent at home.
	   ``If there is a plus, it is on foreign policy,'' said Harry
Tjan, an analyst at the Center for Strategic and International
Studies, a private think-tank in Jakarta.
	   A fluent English speaker, the talkative Habibie should be at
ease hobnobbing with heads of state at APEC in a way that the aloof
Suharto never could.
	   He is likely to get words of encouragement from his peers for
his domestic reforms. In a boost to his international stature, U.S.
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright is scheduled to visit
Indonesia after the APEC summit.
	   Last month, Habibie made a splash when he met the daughter of
Anwar Ibrahim, the ousted deputy prime minister in Malaysia who was
jailed after campaigning for democratic reform. Habibie also
canceled a trip to Kuala Lumpur in concern over Anwar's treatment.
	   His actions flouted a tenet of the Association of Southeast
Asian Nations, a regional trade group whose members have long
refrained from commenting on each other's affairs.
	   Nor did Indonesia curb the activities of Mohamed Ezam Mohamed
Nor, an Anwar aide who fled Malaysia for fear of arrest and
publicized his pro-democracy cause in Jakarta.
	   ``Human rights is going to be at the core of Indonesian domestic
politics in the years to come and inevitably it will also impact on
its external relations,'' said Dewi Fortuna Anwar, a presidential
aide.
	   But, she added, ``The Asian tradition of non-interference is
still very much ingrained. There's a general reluctance to throw it
overboard completely.''
	   With 200 million people and 17,000 islands, Indonesia is the
world's fourth most populous nation and its sheer size and huge
natural resources make it a natural leader.
	   Yet Habibie is so busy shoring up political support at home that
pursuing an assertive foreign policy will be hard.
	   ``Indonesia has so many constraints on the government side,''
said Tjan, the analyst. ``We are waiting for an internal settlement
first.''

Officials fear trade dispute could derail APEC summit
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DAVID THURBER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Each year since they began holding
annual trade summits five years ago, leaders of Pacific Rim nations
have announced modest progress at their meetings toward a goal of
free trade in the region by the year 2020.
	   But at next week's meeting in Malaysia, stiff Japanese
opposition to fishery and forestry tariff cuts may scuttle a
centerpiece trade agreement and set back the group's efforts to
form a Pacific trading community.
	   Just when closer cooperation is needed to help extract the
region from its widening financial crisis, the trade dispute has
inflamed rhetoric within the consensus-based Asia-Pacific Economic
Cooperation forum, comprised of 20 nations plus Hong Kong.
	   Malaysian officials say Asia's economic crisis is likely to
dominate this year's APEC summit, further derailing the group's
traditional free-trade agenda.
	   ``It's going to be a challenging, cantankerous meeting,''
Australian Trade Minister Tim Fischer said.
	   U.S. officials said the meeting's success or failure rests on a
single issue: whether Japan agrees to liberalize its fisheries and
forestry products industries as part of a nine-sector trade
agreement.
	   ``Japan thus far has played a destructive role in this
process,'' U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky said, in
unusually strident language. ``This is a completely unacceptable
position.''
	   At their meeting last year in Vancouver, British Columbia, APEC
leaders retained their focus on trade, avoiding specific actions on
Asia's currency crisis, and instead agreed to speed up the lifting
of trade barriers for the nine product categories.
	   That decision was an acknowledgment of the slow progress the
group has made toward free trade since announcing four years ago
that its industrialized members will voluntarily lift all trade
barriers by 2010 and its poorer members by 2020.
	   Since then, each country has been slowly refining an
''individual action plan'' _ a map of the route it plans to take
toward free trade. In many cases, the plans have not gone beyond
the commitments each country has already made to the World Trade
Organization, or to the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, a
smaller nine-nation regional organization that recently agreed to
reduce tariffs on many products to zero by the year 2003.
	   Last month, ASEAN trade ministers said they remain committed to
more liberalization because it will encourage trade and investment
and thereby help the region recover from its financial upheaval.
	   But a substantial number of other officials and businessmen say
they want the pace of trade liberalization slowed so that local
industries _ particularly in countries undergoing tough reforms
mandated by the International Monetary Fund _ can be protected from
outside competition while they recover.
	   Most of Southeast Asia's once-proud economies are now mired in
recession, with the IMF reforms contributing to slower growth
through higher interest rates and bank closures.
	   For the broader APEC region, which includes North America, East
Asia, Australia and New Zealand, economic growth is expected to
slide to 1.5 percent this year from 3.5 percent last year,
according to a report to be presented at the APEC meeting.
	   ``It is clear that trade liberalization will take a back seat''
at APEC, said former Philippine Foreign Undersecretary Federico
Macaranas, who helped head the Philippines' hosting of APEC two
years ago.
	   ``It's impossible to force countries like Indonesia to
liberalize while they are following the IMF's prescription. It's
suicidal. South Korea is in the same situation. Who would answer
for the social crisis that would result from the loss of jobs?''
	   APEC estimated in 1997 that APEC members would reap dlrs 52
billion in benefits by eliminating barriers to trade within the
group. That would increase to dlrs 62 billion if trade barriers are
removed on trade with other nations as well, it said.
	   The leaders at last year's APEC summit had hoped an agreement on
lifting tariffs in nine industries would be finalized by this
year's meeting.
	   The pact, known as early voluntary sector liberalization, would
cover about dlrs 1.5 trillion in global trade, according to U.S.
estimates.
	   The nine product categories are chemicals, forest products,
medical equipment, energy, telecommunications equipment,
environmental goods and services, gems and jewelry, fish and fish
products, and toys.
	   But Japan says APEC's trade liberalization is voluntary, and
insists it cannot accept a fixed schedule for opening its forestry
and fishery markets because of domestic political realities.
Farmers are among the strongest supporters of its ruling Liberal
Democratic Party.
	   Japan is already the largest importer of American agricultural
commodities, accounting for a 22 percent share of U.S. exports
worth about dlrs 15 billion a year.
	   Officials from several countries, including the United States,
say that without Japan, other nations may balk at participating in
the agreement and the package could fall apart.
	   A breakdown of the agreement could also threaten a U.S. plan to
seek European support for the package, then move the deal to the
World Trade Organization for implementation sometime in 1999.
	   The plan resembles Washington's use of APEC two years ago, when
U.S. officials asked the group to support tariff cuts on computers,
and then used that support to pry open European markets.
	   Malaysia is hardly the most receptive setting for discussions of
trade liberalization.
	   As APEC's host, it has considerable power in setting the agenda,
and Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad has been a frequent
critic of Western pressures for trade liberalization and sees
currency speculation as the root of the world's deepening economic
problems. He is likely to seek APEC support for reforms of the
international monetary system.
	   Other APEC officials also want the group to reduce its
traditional emphasis on free trade.
	   APEC should ``devote more attention ... to overcome the current
economic and financial crisis, and not only be preoccupied with
trade liberalization issues,'' said Indonesian Foreign Minister Ali
Alatas.
	   As a result, APEC, founded on the principle of trade
liberalization, may be forced to begin searching for a new
identity, officials said.
	   Liberalization ``is no longer the accepted wisdom. It is being
questioned,'' said New Zealand businessman Philip Burdon, next
year's chair of the APEC Business Advisory Council and a supporter
of tariff cuts.
	   APEC groups Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, China, Hong Kong,
Indonesia, Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Papua
New Guinea, the Philippines, Singapore, Taiwan, Thailand and the
United States. Russia, Vietnam and Peru will join at the November
summit.

	   BRISBANE, Australia (AP) _ Glenn Panoho, Chris Latham and Nathan
Grey have been given the front-running to fill vacant test
positions on Australia's rugby union tour of France and England.
	   The three were named Tuesday to play in the first match against
France A in Lille on Nov. 16 in what is considered a shadow test
side with only test matches against France and England to follow.
	   Panoho got a prop spot left vacant by the withdrawal of team
veteran Dan Crowley on Monday.
	   Latham was given his chance in Matthew Burke's fullback role and
Grey took over Tim Horan's spot at inside center. As he did for
much of the season, Jason Little fills Ben Tune's spot on the wing.
	   Tune, Horan, Burke and winger Damian Smith were all forced out
of the tour through injury.
	   Australian manager John McKay said Panoho would play at
tighthead prop and Blades in the No. 3 jersey. Former Argentine
prop Patricio Noriega came onto the reserves bench in his first
match in Australian colors.
	   The team to play France A: Chris Latham, Jason Little, Daniel
Herbert, Nathan Grey, Joe Roff, Steve Larkham, George Gregan,
Toutai Kefu, David Wilson, Matt Cockbain, John Eales, Tom Bowman,
Andrew Blades, Phil Kearns, Glenn Panoho. Reserves: Chris Whitaker,
Manuel Edmonds, Mitch Hardy, Willie Ofahengaue, Patricio Noriega,
Michael Foley. (djp)

	   HAMILTON, Bermuda (AP) _ Bermuda's Labor Party swept to victory
for the first time in general elections on Monday, ending the
conservatives' 30-year rule.
	   Preliminary results gave 26 of the 40 Parliament seats to the
Bermuda Labor Party and the rest to former Premier Pamela Gordon's
United Bermuda party. Labor had held 18 seats in the outgoing
government.
	   Labor Party leader Jennifer Smith, who will become the new
premier, said Bermuda's residents had met their ``date with
destiny'' in Monday's elections.
	   Turnout was 77 percent of the 36,000 voters on the island,
Britain's most populous remaining colony with 60,000 people.
	   The biggest issue was the economy, which is dependent on tourism
and a booming off-shore banking industry now threatened by
proposals for stricter regulation.
	   The Labor Party, which has moved to the political center in
recent years, sought to reassure the island's white-led business
community during the campaign, promising to ``work in partnership
with the banking community, international business and the island's
chamber of commerce.''
	   The 35-year-old Labor Party, backed by the island's blacks, had
never won an election before. Many blamed racist fears that they
would mishandle the economy.
	   Although Bermudians enjoy one of the highest standards of living
in the world with a per capita income of dlrs 36,000, some complain
of declining education standards and the lack of affordable housing
on their 22-square-mile island.
	   Drugs and crime are also causing problems on Bermuda, which
islanders still pride as one of the safest vacation destinations.
	   In Devonshire North, a largely black constituency, voters said
Gordon's United Bermuda Party had not done enough for the island's
poorer residents.
	   ``They won. We lost,'' Gordon said. ``We've got a lot of work to
do, and if this is what the people of Bermuda need to start the
healing process, then we need to get busy.''
	   Gordon's ruling United Bermuda Party was founded by the white
merchant class descended from Britons who settled in Bermuda in the
1600s and make up 35 percent of the population. Gordon is black, as
is most of her Cabinet. However, the party is seen by many as part
of the white establishment.
	   Most Bermudians are blacks of African descent.
	   Racial tensions dominated politics here in the 1970s, and race
riots erupted in 1972-73 and in 1977.

Local Mexican elections viewed as test of major party strength

	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Mexico's ruling party celebrated strong
weekend victories in two state gubernatorial elections. But for the
second time this year, party infighting may have cost it a
governorship.
	   The Institutional Revolutionary Party, the longest-ruling party
in the Western hemisphere, was ahead of the conservative National
Action Party 51 to 34 percent in the central state of Puebla with
48 percent of the vote counted on Monday. National Action conceded
defeat.
	   In northwestern state of Sinaloa, with 90 percent of the vote
counted, the ruling party, known as the PRI, led National Action
46.9 to 31.7 percent.
	   But the PRI appeared to have lost the small central state of
Tlaxcala to a man who had been one of its own stalwarts until he
was asked to lead a coalition dominated by the leftist Democratic
Revolution Party, or PRD.
	   With 97 percent of votes counted, coalition candidate Alfonso
Sanchez Anaya had 45.5 percent of the vote to 42.9 percent for
Joaquin Cisneros of the PRI.
	   It was the second time this year that the PRI has lost a state
to a candidate who had bolted the party after being passed over for
its gubernatorial nomination.
	   Sanchez, a 38-year veteran of the party and nephew of former
Gov. Emilio Sanchez Piedras, quit the PRI in April, charging that
party leaders were trying to prevent him from gaining the
nomination.
	   In July, the PRI lost the governorship of Zacatecas state to the
PRD's Ricardo Monreal, a congressman who quit the PRI in anger at
being bypassed for his own party's nomination.
	   Both states were traditional PRI strongholds. The party won 86
percent of the vote in Tlaxcala's 1992 gubernatorial race. It had
65 percent in Zacatecas that year.
	   ``In the states where there has been internal discord, the PRI
has lost,'' political analyst Joel Estudillo said. ``The results in
Zacatecas and Tlaxcala reiterate the need for change within the
PRI.''
	   Still, the PRI managed to win seven of 10 gubernatorial
elections this year _ giving it momentum toward presidential
elections in 2000.
	   ``Those who were betting on a substantial reduction of the PRI's
political strength were absolutely mistaken,'' party Chairman
Mariano Palacios Alcocer said at a news conference Monday night.
	   Sergio Aguayo, a political scientist at the elite university
Colegio de Mexico said the PRI's strong showing was all the more
remarkable coming after recent economic turmoil and reports of
widespread corruption during the administration of former President
Carlos Salinas de Gortari.
	   ``The elections suggest voters are very irritated at the
opposition's inability to help solve the nation's problems,'' he
said. ``This is a warning that there are no blank checks.''
	   The PRI's future had been in doubt following its failure to win
a majority in the lower house of Congress for the first time in the
1997 mid-term elections.
	   ``There were doubts early in the year about the PRI's ability to
win elections. Now it is adapting to a more competitive elections
system in Mexico,'' said Armand Peschard, an analyst with the
Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington.

Sydney organizers deny Irish report on blood test
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Sydney Olympic organizers have
questioned a report from Dublin that reliable blood tests have been
discovered for human growth hormone (HGH) and erythropoietin (EPO).
	   A spokesman for the Sydney Olympic Organizing Committee for the
Olympic Games (SOCOG) said Tuesday the International Olympic
Committee (IOC) does not test blood samples and has said it won't
do so until 100 percent reliable tests are found for samples such
as EPO and HGH.
	   ``Our understanding is that research is still continuing into
finding a totally reliable test for these substances but it hasn't
been achieved yet,'' the spokesman said.
	   SOCOG doping officials have consistently said they are ready to
implement blood tests if scientists find the answers and the IOC
gives them the green light.
	   On Monday, a top British expert on performance-enhancing drugs
recommended that athletes' blood, as well as urine, be tested at
the 2000 Olympics.
	   ``By 2000, unless we are testing with blood, we haven't got a
chance,'' Dr. David Cowan, director of the Drug Control Center at
Kings College London, was quoted as saying in Monday's Irish
Independent newspaper.
	   Speaking at a weekend Dublin conference on doping in
international sports, Cowan emphasized that urine testing failed to
detect abuse of the endurance-building drug EPO and human growth
hormone, or HGH.
	   Cowan, who supervised the establishment of the drug testing
center in Kuala Lumpur for September's Commonwealth Games, has also
been involved in recent research to discover an acceptable test for
substances such as EPO and HGH.
	   He said a research project, funded by the IOC and the European
Union, had discovered reliable blood tests for EPO and HGH.
	   Cowan said he hoped the tests would be accepted when the IOC
staged an international symposium on drugs in Switzerland in
February. (djp)

Pakistan, India turn to economic cooperation

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ As India and Pakistan reached the
halfway mark Tuesday in a series of talks aimed at easing their
rivalry, it became increasingly clear New Delhi was foundering in
its attempt to turn the focus away from their Kashmir territorial
dispute.
	   Last week and Monday, the first three of six rounds of New Delhi
talks _ on water sharing, proposals for a cease-fire on a Kashmiri
battleground known as the Siachen glacier, and a 30-year-old
maritime boundary dispute _ ended with little or no progress
reported. Tuesday, commerce ministry officials from the two
countries opened discussions on boosting trade.
	   The meetings end with talks on terrorism and drug trafficking on
Thursday and cultural ties on Friday.
	   India and Pakistan have fought three wars since each gained
independence from Britain in 1947, and continue to exchange shells
and bullets almost daily across Kashmir, the Himalayan territory
divided between them that both claim in its entirety.
	   Their enmity peaked in May when India tested nuclear weapons and
Pakistan responded with its own tests.
	   Under international pressure following the nuclear talks, the
two countries began peace talks on Kashmir last month in the
Pakistani capital of Islamabad. The ongoing follow-up talks in New
Delhi are a test of India's argument that progress can be made on
lesser issues, improving the atmosphere to the point where progress
also can be made on Kashmir.
	   But Pakistan says nothing can move forward without a Kashmir
settlement, and that stance has overshadowed the New Delhi talks.
	   Still, analysts like Bharat Karnad, a national security expert
at New Delhi's independent Center for Policy Research, say
Tuesday's round on trade ties could yield results. Black market
trade between India and Pakistan is already brisk, Karnad said,
estimating it at dlrs 3 billion a year, indicating that ordinary
people in the two countries want close ties even if their
governments are stalemated over Kashmir.
	   The Times of India reported Tuesday that official exports from
India to Pakistan and from Pakistan to India totaled about dlrs 161
million last year.
	   On Tuesday's agenda was a proposal for cash-strapped Pakistan to
sell electricity to India; Indian demands that Pakistan reciprocate
India's decision to grant most-favored-nation trade status to
Pakistan; steps to improve movement of goods between the two
countries by rail and to start bus service between the Indian
capital and the Pakistani border city of Lahore.

Thai woman jumps to death after boyfriend leaves
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ A Thai woman fell to her death from a
five-story building after police trying to talk her out of suicide
made a sudden, failed bid to grab and rescue her.
	   Police in Hat Yat, 950 kilometers (590 miles) south of Bangkok,
came under criticism Tuesday for the botched rescue, which was seen
by millions of Thais on television.
	   No nets were spread under Sripraphai Cheoyphiew, 25, during the
five-hour standoff Monday and no ambulance had been placed on
standby, only a pickup run by a local charity that normally
collects bodies from car accidents. Police said they had no such
rescue equipment.
	   Sripraphai was reportedly depressed after her Malaysian
boyfriend left her. She stood on the roof of her building during
the ordeal as a plainclothes officer negotiated with her. At one
point, he tried to grab her. In the video, she appeared startled
and fell off the ledge.
	   The officer clutched a handful of her skirt and held onto her
for about five seconds as she scrabbled to find a handhold on the
building wall. But the skirt tore away and she tumbled to the
ground.
	   She died two hours later from internal bleeding.

Israeli warplanes, artillery blast suspected guerrilla bases
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NABATIYEH, Lebanon (AP) _ Israel's warplanes raided suspected
guerrilla positions and its troops shelled villages facing an
Israeli-occupied enclave in South Lebanon overnight, security
officials said Tuesday.
	   The Israeli jets fired at least one missile on the hills of
Sojod in Iqlim al-Tuffah, a stronghold of the Iranian-backed
Hezbollah guerrilla group.
	   The targeted area, often used to launch attacks against Israeli
troops in southern Lebanon, is about 12 kilometers (seven miles)
north of this southern market town and faces the occupied enclave.
	   The air attack was accompanied by heavy shelling by Israeli
gunners and their Lebanese militia allies of suspected guerrilla
hideouts and infiltration trails north of the border zone.
	   There were no immediate reports of casualties from the pre-dawn
raid or night-long shelling, said the Lebanese officials, speaking
on customary condition of anonymity.
	   The raid on Sojod came hours after Israeli jets blasted a valley
between the villages of Yater and Jebal al-Boutom with one missile.
The attack Monday afternoon caused no casualties.
	   In Jerusalem, the Israeli military confirmed both raids on
suspected guerrilla bases, saying that pilots reported accurate
hits on their targets.
	   Hezbollah is leading a guerrilla war to try to oust some 1,500
Israeli soldiers and 2,500 allied militiamen from the border
enclave, which Israel set up in 1985 to prevent cross-border
guerrilla attacks.

	   Luc Robitaille scored twice for the Kings, who ended an 0-3-1

Vancouver.
	   Tsyplakov was parked in front of the Vancouver net when Sean

Japan parties pushing coupon plan for consumers
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Hoping to pull Japan out of recession, the ruling
party and a major opposition force have agreed on a plan to offer
shopping vouchers to eligible consumers, a spokesman said Tuesday.
	   Mitsuyoshi Mizoguchi, of the New Komeito party, said his party
and the ruling Liberal Democrats have agreed ``in principle'' on
the plan. The New Komeito is the second largest opposition party.
	   The idea is to give shopping vouchers to families with children,
aged 15 or younger, and to individual senior citizens, as a way to
prod tight-fisted consumers to help Japan spend its way out of a
nagging economic downturn.
	   But Mizoguchi said the two parties have yet to narrow
differences over whether all people 65 and older should be eligible
or even how much to provide.
	   Local media reports say each eligible person would receive
20,000 yen (dlrs 165) worth of coupons.
	   About 40 million people, or roughly 30 percent of Japanese,
could be able to receive the coupons, the Mainichi newspaper
reported.
	   Top government spokesman Hiromu Nonaka told reporters Tuesday
the government would like to include spending for the proposed
coupons in a supplementary budget to be compiled later this month,
if an agreement on details can be reached.
	   At a regular news conference, Nonaka said the Ministry of Home
Affairs would be the appropriate government body to oversee the
distribution of the vouchers.
	   The government of Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi plans to unveil
the details of its third supplementary budget totaling more than 10
trillion yen (dlrs 81.96 billion) in public works and other
measures next week.
	   After four years apart, the Komeito and New Peace Party, both
backed by the Soka Gakkai lay Buddhist group, merged Saturday into
the New Komeito party. The Komeito originally proposed the voucher
idea.
	   The LDP has a comfortable majority in the powerful lower house,
but needs some opposition support in the upper house to pass
legislation.
	   Nearly 60 percent of Japan's gross domestic product comes from
individual consumption.

Indonesian man confesses to raping 203 women
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) - An Indonesia man who said he wanted to
boost his magic powers confessed to raping 203 women, some of whom
he had married, police said Tuesday.
	   Parimpunan Harahap, 33, was arrested last month after a
13-year-old girl he had allegedly raped told her parents and police
tracked him down in Balangka on Sumatra island. The village is
1,230 kilometers (760 miles) northeast of the capital, Jakarta.
	   Harahap told investigators that he wanted to rape as many as 315
women and had married some of them in order to increase his magic
powers, police Lt. Col. Sunardji said in a telephone interview.
	   ``This case is big and rare. There will be a lot of victims,''
Sunardji said.
	   Harahap said he got his magic powers a few years ago from a
sorcerer who implanted a talisman in his leg, police said. The
talisman can only be removed by surgery.
	   The suspect said he raped his last victim after hypnotizing her
by blowing smoke in her face.
	   In April, a self-proclaimed sorcerer in Sumatra was sentenced to
death after a court found him guilty of killing 42 females,
purportedly in order to increase his magical powers. The sentence
is under appeal.

Report: Singapore's Hewlett-Packard employees to take mandatory
</HEADLINE>
leave

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ As part of its worldwide cost-cutting efforts,
U.S. computer maker Hewlett-Packard Corp. has asked all its 9,000
employees in Singapore to take mandatory leave next month, a
newspaper reported Tuesday.
	   While some of the group's operations will cease during the
Christmas holiday period, others, like the sales office, will
continue to operate, company spokeswoman Cecilia Pang told the
Straits Times.
	   Employees whose operations can't be suspended during Christmas
will take the four-day leave at their own convenience anytime in
December, she added.
	   ``Encouraging employees to take leave is not a bad thing,'' Pang
was quoted as saying.
	   The company's Singapore branch does not have plans for any
layoffs at the moment, Pang said. But she added: ``I can't say that
it's never possible. Anything is possible.''
	   Hewlett-Packard said last month that it would lay off 2 percent
of its work force worldwide as weak sales and soaring expenses
crimp profits.

Data: Asian crisis still hurting Australian tourism industry
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ More Australians are traveling
overseas and fewer tourists are coming to Australia in a double
blow for the local tourism industry, figures released Tuesday show.
	   An extra 147,000 Australians traveled overseas in the eight
months to the end of August this year compared to the same period
last year, an eight percent increase, Australian Bureau of
Statistics arrivals and departures figures showed.
	   There were 129,700 fewer overseas arrivals during the same
period, a five percent drop pegged to huge falls in the number of
visitors from Asia.
	   With the Australian dollar hitting record lows against the U.S.
currency in June and August, but faring better than other regional
currencies, Australians took advantage of cheap airfares and good
exchange rates to travel.
	   Australians visiting Thailand increased 48 percent in the period
while those going to Fiji rose 37 percent. Australian visitors to
Indonesia were up 11 percent with those heading for New Zealand
rose 15 percent.
	   The drift overseas is costing the local industry millions of
dollars, the Tourism Council Australia said.
	   ``This represents huge lost opportunity as well as millions of
dollars in lost expenditure for the domestic tourism sector which
has been flat and under-performing for several years,'' council
chief Don Larkin said.
	   Travel to the United Kingdom remained stable, up just two
percent. The number of Australians traveling to the United States
dropped by eight percent and to Hong Kong by 13 percent.
	   The bureau data also showed that for during September there were
326,200 overseas visitors to Australia, 4,700 fewer than in
September 1997.
	   Separate figures released by the transport department showed the
number of airline passengers into and out of Australia in July fell
by 2.4 percent, compared with July 1997.
	   International passenger numbers in the year to July 31 increased
by just 1.2 percent, compared with an increase of 8.9 percent for
the year ended July 1997.

Sri Lankan man abandons wife and flees country after winning
</HEADLINE>
lottery

<TEXT>
	   COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) _ An arrest warrant has been issued for
a man who left his wife after winning dlrs 50,000 in a lottery and
fled the country when she claimed part of the money, a newspaper
reported Tuesday.
	   Ruwan Sampath, 24, won the jackpot in a state lottery on April
14, lawyers for his wife, Dushyanthi Padmasiri, 22, told a court
Monday, the Lankadipa reported.
	   Two weeks later, Sampath, a construction worker earning about
dlrs 4 a day, moved out at the urging of his parents who had
opposed the two-year-old marriage, lawyers told court.
	   Padmasiri asked a court on June 11 to order him to pay
maintenance, taking into consideration the lottery winnings.
	   Under Sri Lankan law, each partner in a marriage has his own
assets, but in cases of separation or divorce men usually must pay
to maintain women, since women generally earn less than men in this
Indian Ocean island nation.
	   Padmasiri also asked the judge to stop her husband from fleeing
abroad. Judge Iranganie Perera fixed the case for Nov. 9, and
ordered Sampath not to leave the country.
	   But on Monday, Padmasiri's lawyers told court that on Sept. 25
Sampath slipped past immigration officials at Colombo airport. They
were unsure which country he had gone to.
	   The judge in Attanagalle, 30 kilometers (19 miles) northeast of
the capital, Colombo, issued a warrant for his arrest.

Japanese stocks finish lower, dollar rises
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with closing Nikkei, mid-afternoon dollar and bond &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The U.S. dollar rose against the yen Tuesday as
strong sentiment carried through from overseas spurred
dollar-buying. Japanese stocks closed lower in subdued trading.
	   The dollar bought 122.14 yen in mid-afternoon trading, up 2.78
yen from late Monday in Tokyo and also above its late New York
level of 121.57 yen overnight.
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average gained 86.45
points, or 0.61 percent, finishing at 14,108.09 points. On Monday,
the index gained 72.57 points, or 0.51 percent.
	   Traders said the dollar climbed to its highest level against the
yen in over a month as Japanese trust banks and institutional
investors bought dollars.
	   The dollar managed to push through resistance both around 122.00
yen and the overnight high of 122.20 yen, triggering some stop-loss
buying that sent it to an intraday high of 122.70 yen, its highest
level since early October.
	   Traders said the dollar-buying was prompted by the growing
notion that the U.S. Federal Reserve is unlikely to cut interest
rates at its upcoming meeting Nov. 17.
	   Receding fears of U.S. financial market instability were among
other positive factors for the dollar.
	   ``Traders as well as investors are beginning to feel safe again
about investing in dollar-denominated assets,'' said Yukihiko
Hashimoto, senior manager of foreign exchange trading at Sanwa
Bank.
	   In addition, mounting tension over the standoff between the
United Nations and Iraq is leading to safe-haven flows into the
U.S. currency, traders said.
	   Iraq has stopped cooperating with the U.N. inspection team that
searches for chemical and biological weapons, and the United States
is considering options, including air strikes, to force Baghdad to
comply.
	   On the stock market, share prices remained in positive territory
at the end of the morning session on buying of export-oriented
issues amid the weakening trend of the yen against the dollar.
	   A strong dollar tends to increase earnings of Japanese exporters
when they repatriate overseas profits into yen.
	   But the market moved lower in the afternoon in thin trading,

Mir cosmonauts prepare for spacewalk to install meteor device
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Two Russian cosmonauts on the Mir space station
were preparing to make a spacewalk Tuesday to mount a French-made
device for catching and studying small meteorite particles, a news
report said Tuesday.
	   Cosmonauts Gennady Padalka and Sergei Avdeyev were to venture
into open space late Tuesday night to install the ``meteorite
trap,'' which should collect data on a barrage of particles
expected to peak around the Mir in mid-November, the ITAR-Tass news
agency said.
	   The device will stay attached to the Mir until 1999, when it
will be taken back to earth for analysis by a French astronaut who
will fly to the station early next year.
	   The ``meteorite rain'' doesn't pose a serious threat to the Mir
because it consists of tiny remnants, not full meteorites. To be
safe, however, the two cosmonauts will board the Soyuz escape
capsule when the shower reaches its peak.
	   While on their spacewalk, Padalka and Avdeyev will also mount
other scientific hardware on the outside of the Mir, as well as
release a satellite made by schoolchildren from several countries.
The entire mission is scheduled to last six hours, ending early
Wednesday Moscow time.

China renews attacks on Dalai Lama over talks
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Dampening prospects for a breakthrough on Tibet,
China accused the Dalai Lama Tuesday of insisting on independence
for his Himalayan homeland despite claims he wants to compromise.
	   The criticism in an editorial in the official People's Daily was
the latest in a barrage of invective China has launched to counter
reports the Dalai Lama was preparing a peace overture to Beijing
while on his current trip to the United States.
	   The Dalai Lama, the spiritual and political leader of Tibet who
fled into exile 39 years ago, was due to meet Tuesday in Washington
with U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, Vice President Al
Gore and possibly President Bill Clinton.
	   Such meetings have drawn sharp condemnation from China, although
Washington recognizes Beijing's rule over Tibet. Last week, China
warned that high-level political contacts betray U.S. support for
Tibetan independence and could disrupt improving ties.
	   ``We have always opposed foreign interference into China's
internal affairs,'' said the People's Daily, the flagship newspaper
of the ruling Communist Party.
	   In the weeks before the Dalai Lama began his 10-day trip to the
United States, aides said he would make a conciliatory response to
Chinese President Jiang Zemin's offer in June to hold talks.
	   So far, the Dalai Lama has not met China's conditions: that he
renounce independence and recognize Tibet as an inseparable part of
China and Taiwan as a province of China. On Monday, he described
Tibetans as ``victims of human rights violations.''
	   ``The Dalai Lama has presented nothing new this time,'' People's
Daily said. It added that the exiled leader's remarks were designed
to whip up international public opinion and proved he was insincere
about wanting talks.
	   People's Daily accused representatives of the Dalai Lama of
``circling around the issue of Tibetan independence'' in fitful
negotiations over the past 20 years.
	   ``They have never halted their activities to split the
motherland, even when they were at the talks,'' People's Daily
said.
	   People's Daily editorials are reviewed by senior officials
before publication and reflect the views of China's leadership.
	   Despite the harsh talk, ever since President Jiang's offer in
June, both the Chinese government and the Dalai Lama's
government-in-exile have insisted they have kept open contacts.
China has repeated the offer to talk.

Japanese stocks finish lower, dollar rises

 &UR; RETRANSMITTING
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with closing Nikkei, mid-afternoon dollar and bond

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The U.S. dollar rose against the yen Tuesday as
strong sentiment carried through from overseas spurred
dollar-buying. Japanese stocks closed lower in subdued trading.
	   The dollar bought 122.14 yen in mid-afternoon trading, up 2.78
yen from late Monday in Tokyo and also above its late New York
level of 121.57 yen overnight.
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average gained 86.45
points, or 0.61 percent, finishing at 14,108.09 points. On Monday,
the index gained 72.57 points, or 0.51 percent.
	   Traders said the dollar climbed to its highest level against the
yen in over a month as Japanese trust banks and institutional
investors bought dollars.
	   The dollar managed to push through resistance both around 122.00
yen and the overnight high of 122.20 yen, triggering some stop-loss
buying that sent it to an intraday high of 122.70 yen, its highest
level since early October.
	   Traders said the dollar-buying was prompted by the growing
notion that the U.S. Federal Reserve is unlikely to cut interest
rates at its upcoming meeting Nov. 17.
	   Receding fears of U.S. financial market instability were among
other positive factors for the dollar.
	   ``Traders as well as investors are beginning to feel safe again
about investing in dollar-denominated assets,'' said Yukihiko
Hashimoto, senior manager of foreign exchange trading at Sanwa
Bank.
	   In addition, mounting tension over the standoff between the
United Nations and Iraq is leading to safe-haven flows into the
U.S. currency, traders said.
	   Iraq has stopped cooperating with the U.N. inspection team that
searches for chemical and biological weapons, and the United States
is considering options, including air strikes, to force Baghdad to
comply.
	   On the stock market, share prices remained in positive territory
at the end of the morning session on buying of export-oriented
issues amid the weakening trend of the yen against the dollar.
	   A strong dollar tends to increase earnings of Japanese exporters
when they repatriate overseas profits into yen.
	   But the market moved lower in the afternoon in thin trading,
with many players retreating to the sidelines before the government
draws up economic stimulus measures on Nov. 16.
	   Yasuo Ueki, general manager with Nikko Securities Co., said the
market was in an ``adjustment phase'' after rallying for five
consecutive trading sessions in late October.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section was down 5.84 points, or 0.54 percent, to 1,078.32.
The TOPIX fell 5.31 points, or 0.49 percent, the previous day.
	   Overnight on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average
dropped 77.50 points _ or 0.8 percent _ to 8,897.96 on Monday.
	   The yield on the benchmark No. 203 10-year Japanese government
bond fell to 0.815 percent from Monday's finish of 0.825 percent,
driving its price up to 108.76 yen from 108.67 yen.

Tonga protests use of king's photo in Japanese ad
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The Pacific kingdom of Tonga has filed a legal
protest against the use of a photo of its king in advertising for a
Japanese travel agency, a news report says.
	   The country is asking the Osaka District Court in western Japan
to seize the photos and negatives as evidence, Kyodo News quoted
court officials as saying Monday.
	   A spokesman for the court Tuesday refused to confirm the filing
of the protest. Officials could not be reached in Tonga on Tuesday
after regular office hours.
	   Kyodo said the South Pacific island objected to the superimposed
photo of King Taufa'ahau Tupou IV linking arms with a star of a
Japanese all-female drama troupe.
	   The ads, used to promote Hankyu Express International Co.,
appeared in the July 10 evening editions of Japanese national
dailies, train posters and prepaid telephone cards.
	   The kingdom's officials said use of the king's image for
publicity purposes is illegal in Tonga and will not be tolerated
outside the country, the report said.
	   The court failed to find copies of the photos and negatives
during a search Monday of the office of an ad agency representing
Hankyu. The ad agency said it had already disposed of them.
	   According to documents filed by Tonga, the ad agency and Hankyu
were granted permission in spring 1996 to have a photo session with
the king at the Tonga royal palace.
	   A Hankyu official reached Tuesday said the company had no
immediate comment on the case.

<TEXT>
	   KARACHI, Pakistan (AP) _ Hidden in the darkness, heavily armed
troops wade through a maze of narrow lane ways until they reach a
shabby building _ the suspected hideout of ethnic terrorists.
	   A commander barks orders. Paramilitary soldiers and police burst
through the doors. Gunfire breaks out, and screams are heard from
the building.
	   The mission is successful. The troops emerge with several
suspected militants of the Mutteheda Qami Movement, a group that
claims to represent Indian Muslims.
	   This scene replays itself several times a week in this troubled
city.
	   The migrants, who settled in Pakistan in 1947 at the end of
British rule on the Asian subcontinent, say successive governments
have discriminated against them, denying them equal access to jobs,
education and government positions.
	   They want to be recognized as a fifth ethnic group like
Punjabis, Pathans, Baluch and Sindhis. The government refuses.
	   Adding to the tensions, the movement, known as the MQM, split
several years ago. The splinter Haqiqi group routinely clashes with
the mainstream faction in a violent battle for control of the
streets of this southern port city.
	   The internal fighting, along with attacks on police, have taken
at least 1,000 lives this year, according to police statistics. It
has also crushed the economy in Karachi, the country's financial
capital and largest city, with 14 million people.
	   The unrest has turned entire neighborhoods, mostly in eastern
and central Karachi, into battlefields. Hoping to restore order,
Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif imposed federal rule in Karachi in
early November.
	   ``It might take three months or it might take six months . . .
the terrorism here is deep rooted,'' he said at the time.
	   Paramilitary officers park armored personnel carriers on the
fringes of the volatile neighborhoods. Policemen in bulletproof
jackets patrol the streets on foot and in armor-plated cars.
	   But the violence has only worsened, and the militants have begun
to target the police and the paramilitaries. Authorities say they
are afraid.
	   Their fears may be rooted in an earlier crackdown launched by
former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto in 1995.
	   Human rights groups accused Ms. Bhutto's government of allowing
summary executions of suspected terrorists and covering up the
killings. When the president, using his constitutional authority,
dismissed her government in 1996, he accused her of sanctioning
police hit squads.
	   Since then, dozens of policemen involved in the cleanup
operation have been killed, said Karachi police officials, who
spoke on condition of anonymity fearing retaliation.
	   ``A large number of police officials, who were involved in the
operation during the previous government, have fallen victim of the
revenge killings,'' one official said.
	   Sharif said he launched the crackdown in response to the killing
of a well-known philanthropist, Hakim Said, who often criticized
the MQM for its strongarm tactics.
	   ``The prime minister's allegations are baseless and a part of
the conspiracy to vilify the MQM,'' said Kunwar Khalid Younus, a
member of the group's mainstream faction and a lawmaker in the
powerful lower house of Parliament.
	   ``The government is using the false charge of the MQM's
involvement in the Hakim Said's murder to crush the organization
and take control of Karachi,'' he said.
	   Gaining control of Karachi, which is dominated by Muslim
migrants from India, has been a goal of successive governments. As
Pakistan's financial capital, the city brings in roughly 70 percent
of government revenue. Daily strikes and shutdowns have cost the
government millions of dollars in revenues.
	   ``One hour of strike causes a loss (to businesses) of more 300
million rupees (dlrs 6.5 million),'' said Majiyed Aziz, a leading
industrialist and a former president of Karachi chamber of Commerce
and industry.
	   Most businessmen, who have suffered financially from the
lawlessness, support the government's crackdown.
	   But the latest crackdown has raised the danger of another round
of armed insurgency. It also remains to be seen whether a police
force that is notoriously corrupt and ineffective can meet the
challenge.
	   It is unfair for the government to expect ``highly demoralized
and widely corrupt police force'' to restore law and order in
Karachi, said Jamil Yousuf, head of the Citizen Police Liaison
Committee, established more than six years ago to improve relations
between the police and the community.
	   ``There is no protection for the efficient police officers, who
put their lives on the line,'' he said.

	   YORO, Honduras (AP) _ They started running and bicycling from
miles around when the twin-rotor U.S. Army Chinooks thundered
through mountain passes to a soccer field in this Honduran town.
	   Children cheered and their parents watched in relief Monday as
the rear doors of the three choppers popped open. Within minutes,
human chains had formed to toss 16 tons worth of precious flour,
beans, cooking oil and maize onto trucks _ all collected by the
World Vision relief agency.
	   Yoro, a mountain town fending for itself since Hurricane Mitch
cut it off from the rest of the world, no longer felt so alone.
	   ``We are incommunicado,'' Raymundo Reyes, a 50-year-old
subsistence farmer, said as dozens of kids mobbed a pilot giving
out gum and candy bars. ``We've been sharing all we have. We have
been isolated.''
	   Yoro, 80 miles (128 kilometers) north of Tegucigalpa, lost power
and water when the Rio Jalegua overflowed its banks. Landslides
buried 15 miles (24 kilometers) of highways leading to town.
	   Monday's aid delivery was part of an ambitious multinational
mission delivering tons of supplies to remote Central American
towns. Dozens of U.S. aircraft, from giant C-17 transports to
Blackhawk helicopters, are participating. On the ground in
Honduras, U.S. military engineers and Seabees are rebuilding roads
and temporary bridges to help aid get through.
	   Like countless other towns across Central America, Yoro needs
corn, beans, sorghum, clean water and new pipes to deliver it.
	   Some of the surrounding mountain hamlets still haven't been
heard from, said Mayor Oscar Orlando Burgos, 41, gesturing toward
the hills surrounding the field.
	   Neighbors have pitched in to help each other, sharing dwindling
supplies of food or the comfort of coffee each dawn. Jorge David
Caldera, 71, had only a dozen eggs and sacks of plantain chips for
sale in his tiny market.
	   While awaiting aid, Yoro's residents also banded together to
clear the highways of debris.
	   ``We have worked 100 percent since the storm. We are trying to
make gold from the mud,'' said Jose Albani Hernandez, a local radio
reporter.
	   While residents unloaded the helicopters, the Chinook crew
members entertained children and, in an idle moment, discussed
upcoming NASCAR races and Ohio State's upset loss in college
football.
	   Known as the ``Sugar Bears,'' a name inherited from transport
duty during Vietnam, the members of Charlie Company 1-228th
Aviation Battalion, based in Panama, have run dozens of hurricane
aid flights in Honduras.
	   Monday was a good day for flying, with hot, sunny weather and
firm ground for landing. However, one aid truck did get stuck on
the muddy field.
	   For an hour, at least, Yoro's townspeople felt a vital
connection to the world.
	   ``Sometimes we have felt so alone,'' said Oscar Majin Isaola, a
45-year-old mechanic.

Foreign minister says U.S., British threat of force `reckless'
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By EILEEN ALT POWELL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraq's foreign minister said that the
American and British threat of a military strike was ``a reckless
act'' and called for a political solution to the dispute over U.N.
weapons inspections.
	   The minister, Mohammed Saeed al-Sahhaf, said in an interview
late Monday with Al-Jazeera Television that military action would
``lead to destabilizing the region.''
	   He called on the U.N. Security Council to respond to Iraq's
demand that a planned review of Iraq's compliance with U.N.
resolutions lead to the lifting of punishing sanctions, imposed
eight years ago after Iraq invaded Kuwait.
	   Al-Sahhaf said the Security Council should be ``given a genuine
opportunity _ free from all Anglo-Saxon pressures _ to conduct a
comprehensive review of the situation that is acceptable to all
parties.''
	   This, al-Sahhaf said, should ``lead us to start the process of
lifting the embargo on Iraq.''
	   ``As for those screaming and threatening the use of force, this
is nothing but a reckless act in the region,'' al-Sahhaf told the
Qatari television station.
	   In using the phrase ``Anglo-Saxon pressures,'' al-Sahhaf
referred to threats by the United States and Britain to use
military action after Iraq announced on Oct. 31 that it was halting
cooperation with the U.N. Special Commission.
	   The commission is responsible for overseeing the destruction of
Iraq's chemical and biological weapons as well as long-range
missiles.
	   UNSCOM must certify that Iraq has eliminated its weapons of mass
destruction before the Security Council will lift the sanctions,
which limit Iraq's sale of oil, its economic mainstay.
	   Iraq acted just one day after the Security Council agreed to
review the country's compliance with U.N. resolutions. But it did
not accede to Iraq's demand that this be linked to lifting the
sanctions.
	   Al-Sahhaf said ``intensive contacts'' were under way _ including
with Prakash Shah, the special envoy of U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan _ to resolve the impasse. Ireland's former prime minister,
Albert Reynolds, left Iraq on Monday after a three-day visit
pledging to lobby Britain and the United States to avoid using
force and seek a negotiated settlement.
	   ``There is no solution but the diplomatic-political solution,''
Al-Sahhaf insisted.
	   British Defense Secretary George Robertson warned during a visit
to Kuwait on Monday that the patience of the international
community was ``drifting away'' and that ``the option of force is
there, is real.''
	   U.S. President Bill Clinton met Sunday with his top security
advisers but put off a decision on whether to use force against
Iraq.
	   Meanwhile, the state-run daily Al-Qadissiya reported Tuesday
that Iraq's vice president, Taha Yassin Ramadan, told a visiting
journalist that Iraq's Oct. 31 decision is ``a logical, just and
legal right'' of the country and that Iraq would not reverse it.
	   He accused the United States of ``hollow threats'' and said
military action would only strengthen Iraq's determination to end
the embargo.

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ A police official testified
Tuesday that he had coerced two key witnesses into retracting
sexual misconduct allegations against Anwar Ibrahim, allegedly on
orders from the former deputy prime minister himself.
	   Anwar's trial on sex and corruption charges has captured
worldwide attention. He was once in line to rule this country of 22
million people, but is now seeking to ward off a lengthy prison
term and political oblivion.
	   Tuesday's testimony focused on statements by Ummi Hafilda, who
said Anwar had sex with the wife of his own personal secretary.
Ummi is the secretary's sister.
	   The court was also considering statements by Azizan Abu Bakar,
who served as Anwar's driver and claimed the defendant committed
sodomy with him.
	   Both later retracted their allegations, in what prosecutors
claim was a deliberate cover-up attempt by Anwar while he was still
in power as deputy prime minister.
	   Abdul Aziz Husin of the police Special Branch testified that he
and other officers subjected Ummi ``to intense mental pressures''
in getting her to retract the allegations.
	   That included interrogation ``from midnight to morning'' and
threats to jail her under a law that allows for indefinite
detention without trial.
	   ``These combined approaches subjected her to intense mental
pressures until she lost the will to resist and succumbed to the
interrogation team,'' Abdul Aziz told the court.
	   Abdul Aziz said he and other officers used similar techniques on
Azizan, the driver who claimed to have committed sodomy with Anwar.
	   The trial has become a point of contention with Malaysia about
to play host to a summit of Asia-Pacific leaders, including U.S.
President Bill Clinton, next week. Critics say the trial and
allegations that police beat the 51-year-old Anwar highlight the
country's human rights abuses.
	   Anwar, dressed casually in a white shirt with no tie, sat in the
defendant's dock and appeared unmoved by Tuesday's testimony. He is
being held in prison, possibly for the duration of the trial.
	   Separately, Anwar's wife, Azizah Ismail, read a statement to
reporters from her husband, denying reports that he has a
controlling interest in a company whose name has surfaced during
the investigations against him.
	   Last week, the first witness, former Special Branch Chief
Mohamed Said Awang, testified that Anwar had forced police to
arrest and coerce retractions from the two.
	   Anwar was arrested Sept. 20, two weeks after he was fired by
Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad, setting off anti-government
protests. Anwar has pleaded innocent to 10 charges of corruption
and illegal sex acts.
	   Dozens of diplomats, international human rights and jurist
groups are sitting in on the trial, which is expected to last well
into next year.
	   The proceedings have created friction between Malaysia and some
of the 20 leaders who will take part in a summit of the Asia
Pacific Economic Cooperation group in Kuala Lumpur Nov. 17-18.
	   Denying the charges against him, Anwar has said they were
fabricated because Prime Minister Mahathir considered Anwar's
popularity a threat to his 17-year rule.

Everyone knows about Tibet, but how about the Uighurs, Mongolians?
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With US-Dalai-Lama &QL; 
 &UR; By WILLIAM FOREMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Although Tibetans are not the only people
struggling to break free from Chinese rule, they've attracted the
most attention with the help of two Hollywood films and backing
from celebrities like Richard Gere.
	   As Tibet's spiritual leader, the Dalai Lama, continues his U.S.
visit this week, getting more TV time and newspaper coverage,
activists with other movements said they'll watch the saffron
robe-clad Buddhist with envy.
	   The little-known groups include the Uighurs (pronounced
HWEE-gurs), a Muslim minority in China's westernmost region of
Xinjiang, which they call Eastern Turkestan. There are also the
Mongolians, the descendants of Genghis Khan, part of whose homeland
still remains under Chinese control and is known as Inner Mongolia.
	   Like the Tibetans, both groups claim the Chinese have stolen
their independence, discouraged religious traditions, and used
torture and mass killings to crush dissent _ claims denied by
China, which fiercely opposes giving up the land.
	   ``The Dalai Lama's visit reminds us that we still need to work
very hard for more attention,'' said Oyunbilig of the Inner
Mongolian People's Party, which has 30 members in the United
States.
	   Although Oyunbilig _ who like many Mongolians uses only one name
_ wishes his cause could attract half as much publicity, he doesn't
resent the Tibetans' success, which he says is the product of
decades of organizing.
	   ``It convinces us that if we work very hard, we can achieve what
the Tibetans have,'' said the software engineer from Germantown,
Maryland.
	   Last month, the Uighurs (also spelled Uyghurs) and other
independence groups met in New York to discuss ways to cooperate
and condemn rights abuses in China. The groups have joined before
at rallies, but the protests have frustrated some of the
non-Tibetans.
	   ``Everytime we demonstrate together, it seems that everybody
pays attention to Tibet and it's like the Uighurs are working for
Tibet,'' said Huji Tuerdi, a member of the Washington-based Uyghur
American Association, which has 56 members in the United States and
Canada.
	   Small exile communities handicap the movements, and most
activists have full-time jobs, leaving them little time to organize
protests.
	   The most important thing these groups lack is a high profile
leader, such as the Dalai Lama, said Larry Gerstein, president of
the International Tibet Independence Movement, based in Fishers,
Indiana.
	   ``He's an excellent speaker and a very warm and gentle figure,''
Gerstein said.
	   Other factors working in the movement's favor include Tibetan
Buddhism, which advocates nonviolence and has won many American
converts, including Gere. Tibet also enjoys a reputation as a
mystical mountain kingdom, portrayed in the movies ``Seven Years in
Tibet'' and ``Kundun.''
	   The Uighur's homeland has yet to capture Hollywood's
imagination. Although the territory _ three times the size of
France _ enjoys the mystique of being on the ancient Silk Road,
it's mostly a sparsely populated desert region.
	   The Turkic-speaking Uighurs must also overcome stereotypes,
associated with Islamic groups, of being involved in terrorist
activity, Tuerdi said. Some groups in China have been tied to
bombings and riots _ violence that Tuerdi said his group opposes.
	   Most Uighurs never developed a deep religious faith because
believers in Islam, like other religions in China, have at times
been persecuted by the Communist government, he said.
	   ``I've never been to a mosque in my life,'' said Tuerdi, who
came to America in 1984 and now works as a chemist in Princeton,
New Jersey.
	   Unlike the Tibetans, who have an exile government based in
nearby India, the Uighurs and Mongolians say they get little
support from Central Asian neighbors preoccupied with their own
woes and fearful of angering powerful neighbor China.
	   A reluctance to support independence for Inner Mongolia surfaced
at a gathering this month of 100 Mongolians originally from China,
Russia and the nation of Mongolia, which broke away from China and
declared itself independent in 1921.
	   Dressed in traditional blue, brown and red wraparound coats, the
Mongolians met in New Brunswick, New Jersey, to commemorate Genghis
Khan, the 13th-century warlord who united the warring Mongol tribes
that conquered most of the known world.
	   The event was a cultural celebration and speakers did not make
specific calls for reuniting Inner Mongolia with Mongolia.
	   ``It's important to keep friendly relations with powerful
nations,'' Yaichil Batsuuri, a Mongolian diplomat, said.

	   SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP) _ Helicopters roared into the
hills with aid for the starving and Central American leaders faced
the task of rebuilding after Hurricane Mitch set their countries
back 50 years.
	   The presidents of four nations appealed to lenders and creditors
for help in the aftermath of a storm that laid their economies to
waste and took an estimated 10,000 lives.
	   ``In 72 hours, we lost what we had built, little by little, in
50 years,'' Honduran President Carlos Flores Facusse said Monday
after a summit in Comalapa, 25 miles south of the capital. He
called his country's dlrs 4.2 billion debt ``unpayable.''
	   Jimmy Carter and French Prime Minister Lionel Jospin have
supported pardoning the foreign debt of countries ravaged by Mitch.
German Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer said some debts should be
forgiven for Honduras and Nicaragua, which owes dlrs 6 billion.
	   But even that may not be enough.
	   ``We need new financing to rebuild the country,'' said
Nicaraguan President Arnoldo Aleman. ``It's no use pardoning the
foreign debt if we don't have immediate aid.''
	   In a joint statement, the Central American leaders called for a
massive aid plan similar to the Marshall Plan, involving the World
Bank, the International Monetary Fund, the Inter-American
Development Bank and the Central American Economic Integration
Bank.
	   They also appealed for a free trade agreement with the United
States and the elimination of tariffs and duties on their exports
to the European Union.
	   Another request was for a general amnesty for illegal immigrants
to the United States from Central America.
	   Presidents Armando Calderon Sol of El Salvador and Miguel Angel
Rodriguez of Costa Rica attended the summit. Guatemalan Foreign
Minister Eduardo Stein represented President Alvaro Arzu.
	   Meanwhile, government and independent relief organizations from
around the world were rushing tons of aid Monday to tens of
thousands isolated in Honduras and Nicaragua.
	   Hundreds of Hondurans swarmed around three U.S. Army Chinook
helicopters that delivered 16 tons of food and medicines Monday to
a soccer field in Yoro, 80 miles (128 kilometers) north of
Tegucigalpa.
	   Like countless towns across the region, Yoro needs food and
drinking water, has had power and sewer lines knocked out and is
isolated by roads buried under landslides.
	   U.S. military engineers were helping repair roads, bridges and
water systems, and private charities sent doctors into remote
regions.
	   An estimated 6,000 people were killed in Honduras, the country
hardest hit by Mitch.
	   Most of the farm sector was destroyed, said Chiquita Brands
International, which owns or controls half of Honduras' 50,000
hectares (123,550 acres) of banana farms.
	   The company is contributing millions to provide aid and build
infrastructure, said Steve Warshaw, president and chief operating
officer. ``The effects of this tragedy will create hardships in
Honduras for years to come,'' he said.
	   The Honduran Education Ministry canceled the school year in the
seven provinces hit hardest by Mitch, which wiped out at least 315
schools.
	   Mitch also was an ``ecological disaster'' that caused
irreversible damage to delicate forests and mangrove swamps in
western Nicaragua, the environmental group Humboldt Center said.
	   Canada began sending troops to the area Monday. Britain said
about 1,400 Royal Navy and Royal Marines were helping with relief
efforts, and Spain reportedly will contribute dlrs 45 million.
	   In Nicaragua, where critics say the government has been too slow
with relief help, the Interior Ministry said it had expelled a U.S.
woman under contract with the U.S. Agency for International
Development, Julie Gare Noble, for a ``slanderous, tendentious and
baseless report.'' No other details on the incident were released.

Israeli warplanes, artillery blast suspected guerrilla bases
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NABATIYEH, Lebanon (AP) _ Israel's warplanes raided suspected
guerrilla positions and its troops shelled villages facing an
Israeli-occupied enclave in South Lebanon overnight, security
officials said Tuesday.
	   The Israeli jets fired at least one missile on the hills of
Sojod in Iqlim al-Tuffah, a stronghold of the Iranian-backed
Hezbollah guerrilla group.
	   The targeted area, often used to launch attacks against Israeli
troops in southern Lebanon, is about 12 kilometers (seven miles)
north of this southern market town and faces the occupied enclave.
Israeli military gave no reason for this particular attack.
	   The air attack was accompanied by heavy shelling by Israeli
gunners and their Lebanese militia allies of suspected guerrilla
hideouts and infiltration trails north of the border zone.
	   There were no immediate reports of casualties from the pre-dawn
raid or night-long shelling, said the Lebanese officials, speaking
on customary condition of anonymity.
	   The raid on Sojod came hours after Israeli jets blasted a valley
between the villages of Yater and Jebal al-Boutom with one missile.
The attack Monday afternoon caused no casualties.
	   In Jerusalem, the Israeli military confirmed both raids on
suspected guerrilla bases, saying that pilots reported accurate
hits on their targets.
	   Hezbollah is leading a guerrilla war to try to oust some 1,500
Israeli soldiers and 2,500 allied militiamen from the border
enclave, which Israel set up in 1985 to prevent cross-border
guerrilla attacks.

Mitch ravages Nicaragua's fragile ecosystems

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) _ Hurricane Mitch has caused an
``ecological disaster'' in the delicate forests and mangrove swamps
of western Nicaragua, an environmental group says.
	   The fragile ecosystems in five western provinces were ripped
apart by the same storm that killed an estimated 10,000 people in
Central America.
	   ``We lost biological and cultural riches, sources of decoration,
medicine'' and even food in some communities, the Humboldt Center
said Monday.
	   In some areas, the damage is irreversible, said the center, a
non-governmental organization sponsored by German and British
environmental groups.
	   ``Wildlife, especially iguanas, were seriously impacted by the
destruction of the habitat that serves for refuge, food and
reproduction,'' the group said.
	   The hardest hit areas were the basins of the Coco and Matagalpa
rivers and the Lagoon of Managua.
	   The rain dumped by Mitch was 15 times heavier than normal,
eroding hillsides and stripping leaves from trees. The rushing
water also spread pesticides and poisonous chemicals from gold
mines over wide areas, the center said.
	   The chemicals affected the mangrove swamps, and the center said
great numbers of sea creatures, especially shrimp, were expected to
die in coming weeks.
	   It appealed for international aid to try to save what's left but
said it will take at least 35 years to recover part of the affected
areas and low-growth plants.
	   In addition, the disappearance of some species will allow the
invasion of other harmful types, such as rats and insects that
could spread disease, the center said.
	   For now, relief efforts on the Coco River were concentrated on
saving the native Miskito communities ravaged by Mitch.
	   About 40,000 Miskitos lost their harvests and 80 percent saw
their homes destroyed, Congressman Steadman Fagoth told the Mexican
government news agency Notimex.
	   British ships and helicopters have tried to bring food to
hamlets and rescue villagers stranded by waters that rose 50 feet
(15 meters) above normal levels, Notimex said.

Indonesian assembly convenes to cast rules for 1999 elections

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Amid tight security and student
protests, President B.J. Habibie on Tuesday opened a government
assembly that will cast rules for 1999 parliamentary elections.
	   Leaders of the People's Consultative Assembly said they were
determined to abandon the authoritarian legacy of former President
Suharto, who quit in May amid riots and protests.
	   But hundreds of students who gathered at a university campus
rejected the meeting of Indonesia's highest legislative body,
saying it was not sincere about democratic reform. They cited the
military's prominent role in politics.
	   Not far from the Parliament, several hundred members of pro- and
anti-government groups, some armed with sticks, jeered and
threatened each other before trooops dispersed them peacefully.
There were no arrests.
	   Inside the green-roofed hall of Parliament, House Speaker
Harmoko declared before 1,000 delegates that constitutional change
was the best way to guide Indonesia's transition to democracy.
	   ``This is actually the time for us to think clearly, so as to
prevent the euphoria of freedom from burying the very essence of
democracy,'' said Harmoko, a onetime ally of Suharto.
	   ``We are therefore confident that the people will never accept a
government formed by way of anarchy,'' Harmoko said.
	   Fears abound that political tension now will trigger unrest
similar to the riots that eventually forced Suharto from office.
Students demonstrated against the assembly Monday, but huge numbers
of troops blocked them from approaching Parliament.
	   Harmoko said delegates would revoke old decrees that preserved
special presidential powers during the Suharto era, and would
concentrate on human rights and clean government and trying to fix
Indonesia's shattered economy.
	   ``This is no longer the time for us to give a negative response
to criticism lodged against the government,'' he said. ``Worse even
when quite often the reaction over a criticism is accompanied by
the allegation that it is a subversive exercise.''
	   In a sign of compromise, Indonesia's military chief has said
that the armed forces are willing to discuss demands to limit their
prominent role in politics.
	   Gen. Wiranto said any decisions should be left to the delegates
at the assembly, formerly a haven for Suharto loyalists who
re-elected the former president in March to a seventh five-year
term.
	   One proposal to be considered by the assembly would reduce the
number of seats allotted to the military in the 500-seat Parliament
from 75 to as few as 25. The military began scaling back its role
in politics in the final years of Suharto's authoritarian rule.
	   Student protesters, however, say all members of Parliament
should be elected and appointed seats should be abolished.
	   Habibie, a onetime confidant of Suharto who has tried to
distance himself from the former leader, wants to hold
parliamentary elections in June, followed by the selection of a new
head of state by a newly designed assembly at the end of 1999.
	   ``We regard the general election as the best way for the people
to determine their own future in a democratic manner,'' Harmoko
said.
	   Habibie did not speak at the assembly to avoid giving the
impression that he was trying to sway the delegates. He is expected
to run as a presidential candidate next year.
	   The convening of the assembly comes as the world's fourth-most
populous nation grapples with its worst economic crisis in decades.
	   Inflation and unemployment are high, and millions of people are
sinking into poverty. Rioting and looting over price rises have
occurred sporadically for months in many areas.

	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Rescuers were trying to reach 25
workers trapped when a tunnel they were digging collapsed, the
official Antara news agency reported Tuesday.
	   The report said 30 others were rescued soon after Monday's
accident at a dam construction site in Tanggamus district on the
southern end of Sumatra Island, about 230 kilometers (140 miles)
northwest of Jakarta.
	   Several were hospitalized in serious condition.
	   Antara said the tunnel's roof caved in when framework holding it
in place collapsed after a steel cable broke.
	   The report did not say how deep the workers were when the roof
fell in.
	   No further details were immediately available.

Foreign minister says U.S., British threat of force `reckless'
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By EILEEN ALT POWELL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraq's foreign minister said that the
American and British threat of a military strike was ``a reckless
act'' and called for a political solution to the dispute over U.N.
weapons inspections.
	   The minister, Mohammed Saeed al-Sahhaf, said in an interview
late Monday with Al-Jazeera Television that military action would
``lead to destabilizing the region.''
	   He called on the U.N. Security Council to respond to Iraq's
demand that a planned review of Iraq's compliance with U.N.
resolutions lead to the lifting of punishing sanctions, imposed
eight years ago after Iraq invaded Kuwait.
	   Al-Sahhaf said the Security Council should be ``given a genuine
opportunity _ free from all Anglo-Saxon pressures _ to conduct a
comprehensive review of the situation that is acceptable to all
parties.''
	   This, al-Sahhaf said, should ``lead us to start the process of
lifting the embargo on Iraq.''
	   ``As for those screaming and threatening the use of force, this
is nothing but a reckless act in the region,'' al-Sahhaf told the
Qatari television station.
	   In using the phrase ``Anglo-Saxon pressures,'' al-Sahhaf
referred to threats by the United States and Britain to use
military action after Iraq announced on Oct. 31 that it was halting
cooperation with the U.N. Special Commission.
	   The commission is responsible for overseeing the destruction of
Iraq's chemical and biological weapons as well as long-range
missiles.
	   UNSCOM must certify that Iraq has eliminated its weapons of mass
destruction before the Security Council will lift the sanctions,
which limit Iraq's sale of oil, its economic mainstay.
	   Iraq acted just one day after the Security Council agreed to
review the country's compliance with U.N. resolutions. But it did
not accede to Iraq's demand that this be linked to lifting the
sanctions.
	   Al-Sahhaf said ``intensive contacts'' were under way _ including
with Prakash Shah, the special envoy of U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan _ to resolve the impasse. Ireland's former prime minister,
Albert Reynolds, left Iraq on Monday after a three-day visit
pledging to lobby Britain and the United States to avoid using
force and seek a negotiated settlement.
	   ``There is no solution but the diplomatic-political solution,''
Al-Sahhaf insisted.
	   British Defense Secretary George Robertson warned during a visit
to Kuwait on Monday that the patience of the international
community was ``drifting away'' and that ``the option of force is
there, is real.''
	   U.S. President Bill Clinton met Sunday with his top security
advisers but put off a decision on whether to use force against
Iraq.
	   Meanwhile, the state-run daily Al-Qadissiya reported Tuesday
that Iraq's vice president, Taha Yassin Ramadan, told a visiting
journalist that Iraq's Oct. 31 decision is ``a logical, just and
legal right'' of the country and that Iraq would not reverse it.
	   He accused the United States of ``hollow threats'' and said
military action would only strengthen Iraq's determination to end
the embargo.

Police: 5,700 Malaysian officers on hand for APEC summit
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Some 5,700 security personnel will
be on hand to assure the safety of leaders attending the upcoming
Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit, the state news agency
reported Tuesday.
	   Kuala Lumpur was shaken by several weeks of street protests, and
Malaysian authorities are seeking to prevent any further unrest.
	   Ahmad Bahrain Idrus, the assistant police commissioner in charge
of summit security, said his forces were fully prepared.
	   ``World leaders who will be coming need not be anxious and they
can see for themselves the situation in Kuala Lumpur,'' he told the
state-run Bernama news agency. ``The situation is very much
normal.''
	   Every precaution will be taken to protect the 20 leaders, who
include U.S. President Bill Clinton, Australian Prime Minister John
Howard, Philippine President Joseph Estrada, Japanese Prime
Minister Keizo Obuchi and Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien.
	   They will be holding the summit Nov. 17-18.
	   As early as Tuesday, dozens of Malaysian police had started
moving into positions at the Nikko Hotel, where the Japanese
delegation will be staying.
	   Preparatory meetings among officials and ministers begin
Thursday.
	   Entry into specific areas will be blocked to those not wearing
authorized passes. Sophisticated metal detectors will be used at
all entrances to summit-related sites.
	   Ahmad Bahrain, the assistant police commissioner, said his
officers would work closely with the security personnel
accompanying each country's delegation.
	   Supporters of former deputy prime minister Anwar Ibrahim have
taken to the streets dozens of times in the past two months to show
their displeasure over his arrest on sexual misconduct and
corruption charges.
	   Anwar is currently on trial, and a major open question is
whether his growing ranks of supporters will demonstrate again
during next week's summit.
	   In the event that street protests do break out, the police will
take action, Ahmad Bahrain said, adding there would be ``no
compromise'' in security measures.
	   Other countries whose leaders will be attending the Asia-Pacific
Economic Cooperation summit are Brunei, Chile, China, Hong Kong,
Indonesia, South Korea, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Papua New
Guinea, Singapore, Taiwan, and Thailand. Russia, Vietnam and Peru
will be made members of the trade group during the summit.

Government ready to give up stake in Philippine Airlines
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ The Philippine government is ready to
give up its stake in ailing Philippine Airlines and will not infuse
any additional capital if a new investor, possibly Cathay Pacific
Airways, comes in, officials said Tuesday.
	   ``Our objective is full privatization. The government's policy
is to be out of the company that is being privatized,'' Finance
Secretary Edgardo Espiritu said.
	   PAL is negotiating with Cathay Pacific, which could buy up to 40
percent of the airline under Philippine law.
	   Cathay Pacific has said it wants management control of the
Philippine flag carrier, which has been mired in debt and labor
unrest. A PAL official has said it is willing to give Cathay
Pacific management control.
	   Several Manila newspapers reported Tuesday that Cathay Pacific
also is demanding that the government divest its shares in PAL
before it will agree to conclude a deal with the airline.
	   PAL executive vice president Manolo Aquino said there was no
such demand, adding that the government's shares in PAL will
naturally be diluted once a deal is forged and Cathay Pacific puts
in new capital.
	   President Joseph Estrada said he would agree to any setup in PAL
as long as it remains the country's flag carrier.
	   ``As long as PAL continues and as long as it remains the flag
carrier of the country, so be it,'' he said.
	   PAL, Asia's oldest airline, has been unable to make payments on
dlrs 2.1 billion in debt after being devastated by a pilots' strike
and by Asia's currency crisis.
	   PAL shut down its operations on Sept. 23 after the ground crew
union turned down a management-proposed recovery plan that included
a 10-year suspension of labor's collective bargaining agreement in
exchange for 20 percent ownership of the airline.
	   Workers agreed to accept the plan nearly two weeks after the
shutdown, and the airline resumed domestic flights Oct. 7 and
international flights Oct. 26.

Afghan opposition claims Taliban violate cease fire
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ Afghanistan's northern-based
opposition accused their Taliban enemies Tuesday of violating a
cease fire and attacking their positions north of the beleaguered
capital.
	   However, they said it wouldn't effect an agreement between
Afghanistan's two warring sides to continue with a prisoner
exchange.
	   The Taliban launched an offensive in Dasht-i-Archi, a district
in northern Kunduz province and resorted to heavy artillery fire in
the Ghorband area of central Parwan province, opposition spokesman
who identified himself only as Arif said.
	   There was no immediate comment from the Taliban militia.
	   Opposition fighters repulsed the Taliban attack in Kunduz
province, while in Parwan province they retaliated, he said.
	   The warring Afghan factions last month agreed to a cease fire
and prisoner exchange negotiated by Said Jalal, a close associate
of Saudi Arabian Crown Prince Abdullah.
	   ``In a country like Afghanistan, some violations of agreements
are possible. . . but it won't hurt the process of exchange of
prisoners,'' he said.
	   Representatives of the northern alliance will visit jails in the
Taliban headquarters in southern Kandahar later Tuesday. There they
will compile a list of their troops being held by the Taliban.
	   The two sides have agreed to exchange up to 3,000 prisoners.
	   The Taliban militia, which controls almost 90 percent of
Afghanistan including the capital Kabul, is facing fierce
resistance from Ahmed Shah Massood's Jamiat-e-Islami in the
remaining 10 percent of the country.
	   The Taliban, or students of Islam are Sunni Muslims and mostly
Pashtuns _ the majority ethnic group of Afghanistan.
	   They follow a harsh version of Islam that bars women from work
and education, forces men to wear beards and bans all light
entertainment including music.
	   The opposition comprise mainly of religious and ethnic
minorities including Shiites, Tajiks, Uzbeks and Hazaras.

United Nations and the possible resumption of Saudi oil supplies to
the kingdom.
	   The state-run Petra News Agency said Tarawneh will deliver a
``written message'' to Saudi King Fahd from King Hussein, who is
receiving cancer treatment in the United States.
	   It did not disclose the contents of the message, but said it was
related to ``bilateral relations and recent developments in the
region and the world.''
	   Information Minister Nasser Judeh told reporters on Monday that
Tarawneh has ``no fixed agenda'' in Saudi Arabia, but suggested his
talks would focus on the Iraq crisis.
	   Other officials said Jordan will ask Saudi Arabia for resumed
oil supplies if an Iraqi confrontation with the west cuts Jordan's
energy lifeline from Baghdad.
	   The Saudis had agreed to resume supplies to Jordan during Iraq's
latest confrontation with the United Nations in February.
	   Jordan receives all its daily requirement of 90,000 barrels of
crude and fuel oil trucked across a desert border from Iraq under a
special arrangement approved by the United Nations Sanctions
Committee.
	   The supplies are exempt from sweeping international sanctions
slapped on Baghdad following its August 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
	   Jordan's Crown Prince Hassan, who is acting as regent while the
king is away, told U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen last week
in Amman that Jordan favored a diplomatic solution to the Iraqi
standoff.
	   The United States and Britain have warned Iraq of a strike if it
failed to rescind its decision to end cooperation with United
Nations weapons inspectors.
	   Iraq accuses the weapons inspectors of being biased and, under
pressure from the Americans, to prolonging the U.N. sanctions on
Iraq by refusing to certify the country has eliminated its weapons
of mass destruction.

Attacker hurls grenade at political group's headquarters
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TBILISI, Georgia (AP) _ Unidentified attackers threw a grenade
in the window of a political group's headquarters early Tuesday,
the same day a trial against members of the group was scheduled to
end.
	   A security guard was injured in the blast, which seriously
damaged the Tbilisi headquarters of the ``Horsemen'' group, said
Interior Ministry spokesman Maya Mosidze.
	   The 1 a.m. attack Tuesday came the same day that Georgia's
Supreme Court was scheduled to hand down a verdict in the trial of
the group's former leader, Dzhaba Ioseliani.
	   Ioseliani and fourteen other men from Horsemen, or Mkhedrioni,
have been accused of masterminding an Aug. 29, 1995, bomb attack on
the motorcade of Georgian President Eduard Shevardnadze, in which
the Georgian leader was cut by flying glass.
	   The trial began last December, and has dragged on for almost a
year. Ioseliani and the others, who deny the accusations, have
forced delays in the trial by going on hunger strikes and shouting
in the courtroom.
	   Ioseliani, who helped Shevardnadze return to power in the former
Soviet republic in 1992, split with the president three years later
after Georgia's government outlawed the Horsemen, then an armed
militia, for alleged involvement in a number of crimes.
	   Ioseliani is one of Georgia's most enigmatic figures, a
convicted robber turned playwright and university professor, who
then became heavily enmeshed in Georgian politics.

Cambodian ruling party rejects handing over top parliamentary job
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By KER MUNTHIT &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ In a move likely to derail efforts
to form a new coalition government, Cambodia's ruling party on
Tuesday rejected the idea of giving the opposition FUNCINPEC party
the presidency of parliament.
	   A statement issued by Chea Sim, president of top leader Hun
Sen's Cambodian People's Party _ as well as the incumbent president
of parliament _ said it was ``impractical'' for FUNCINPEC to take
over the post.
	   FUNCINPEC, the main opposition party, warned Monday that a
three-month stalemate over the formation of a new government would
likely continue unless the CPP made significant concessions.
	   Hun Sen's party won a slight majority in July's parliamentary
elections, but needs FUNCINPEC's cooperation to attain the
two-thirds vote in parliament necessary to approve a new
government.
	   FUNCINPEC said Monday it is prepared to make a contribution to
break the stalemate, but ``a solution can only be realized if all
parties accept to make a concession like FUNCINPEC did in 1993 when
it was the election winner.''
	   After losing the U.N.-sponsored 1993 polls to FUNCINPEC, Hun
Sen's party threatened a resumption of the nation's decades-long
civil war if it couldn't share power. FUNCINPEC at that time agreed
to share the premiership and key ministries with Hun Sen and
conceded the presidency of parliament to his party.
	   ``FUNCINPEC's demand for the 1993 practice to be applied in 1998
is impractical,'' Chea Sim's statement said Tuesday. ``They are
making the issue of parliament's presidency a hostage and a key to
solving the current stalemate.''
	   It described FUNCINPEC's bid to hold parliament's top position
as ``irrational and contradicting democratic principles applied by
many nations in the world.''
	   Hun Sen's party won 64 of the 122 national assembly seats in the
July 26 elections.
	   FUNCINPEC head Prince Norodom Ranariddh and his ally, Sam
Rainsy, alleging election fraud and intimidation by Hun Sen, have
withheld the backing the ruling party needs to form a new
government.
	   They led an exodus of lawmakers to exile after the ceremonial
Sept. 24 opening of parliament, fearing threats of arrests by Hun
Sen after two alleged assassination attempts on his life.
	   King Norodom Sihanouk, as a politically independent and publicly
respected figure, has offered to play host for a summit meeting of
the contending political leaders in an effort to end the stalemate.
	   On Saturday, Sihanouk also offered to provide royal protection
for Ranariddh, his son, and Sam Rainsy if they return to Cambodia
before the end of this week.
	   Ranariddh, in a letter circulated Tuesday, showed no interest in
the offer of protection and insisted instead that the government
lift limitations on freedom of movement for some of his followers.
	   The government has said that opposition lawmakers are free to
travel in and out of the country, except some ``who have a prima
facie case to answer to the court.'' There appears to be no legal
basis for the travel ban.
	   ``Were such a limitation to apply to myself or to my entourage,
I would not feel safe upon our return to Cambodia,'' Ranariddh
wrote, asking the king to clarify the issue with the government.
	   The opposition leaders are promoting the idea of having a
royal-sponsored summit meeting held outside Cambodia, but Hun Sen's
party has so far rejected the idea.
	   Sam Rainsy has proposed that Sihanouk hold such a meeting at his
residence in Beijing, China, where, he said, the opposition will be
able to negotiate with the CPP without fear and coercion.
	   The king is scheduled to leave for Beijing Saturday for a
medical checkup and treatment of a number of ailments.

Japan's economy may shrink by more than forecast 1.8 percent:
</HEADLINE>
Minister &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan's slowdown may worsen, with the economy
shrinking even more than the predicted 1.8 percent for this fiscal
year, the economic minister said Tuesday.
	   Taichi Sakaiya, head of the Economic Planning Agency, said
Japan's recovery will depend greatly on the health of the American
and European economies.
	   ``In the short term, the economy will worsen,'' he said. But as
long as the American and European economies did not slide further,
Japan's economy might begin to turn around next year, Sakaiya said.
	   The government has forecast that Japan's economy will shrink by
1.8 percent for the fiscal year ending in March 1999. Last year,
the economy shrank by 0.7 percent.
	   But Sakaiya said the rising yen, which slashes exporters'
profits, may further hurt the economy.
	   The dollar was trading at about 122 yen Tuesday, up 3 yen from
Monday but far below the 140 yen-levels it bought over the summer.
	   ``In many ways, Japan's economy is in a dark period,'' Sakaiya
said. ``The situation is serious.''
	   In the past, Japan relied on exports to wrest its economy back
to growth, but the Asian economic crisis was dampening exports as
well, he said.
	   Japan instead needs public spending that will boost consumption
at home, he said.
	   Sakaiya said drastic cultural change was needed to create a more
democratic, consumer-led ``new Japan'' and to discard old policies
that relied on businesses closely abiding by bureaucratic
leadership.

China bullying Philippines, says Manila defense chief
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photos Available &QL; 
 &UR; By OLIVER TEVES &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ China is increasing its military
presence in the Spratlys to bully the Philippines because of
Manila's weak armed forces, Defense Secretary Orlando Mercado said
Tuesday.
	   Mercado said Chinese construction work at a disputed reef in the
South China Sea appears to have military purposes and is not only
to build shelters for fishermen as claimed by China.
	   Last week, Manila delivered a diplomatic protest to Beijing over
the expansion of the concrete platforms it built in 1995 at
Mischief Reef, in the disputed Spratly island group in the South
China Sea.
	   Mercado showed reporters pictures of large wooden barracks being
built on stilts on a concrete foundation adjacent to a cluster of
concrete platforms on the two-by-four-mile (three-by-six-kilometer)
reef.
	   The pictures also showed dozens of workers. Military officers
say the barracks could house 60 to 70 people.
	   President Joseph Estrada said Tuesday he plans to take up the
issue with Chinese President Jiang Zemin on the sidelines of a
meeting of Asia-Pacific leaders in Malaysia next week.
	   ``We will do it through negotiations. Let us not be
confrontational, you know we cannot afford to,'' he said.
	   Chinese officials insist they are only repairing fishing
shelters damaged by natural causes.
	   Mercado said the Chinese were like wolves marking off their
territory by leaving their scent.
	   ``It is obvious that they are establishing a military
presence,'' Mercado said. ``The obvious reason they are doing this
to us is we are weak. To put it bluntly, the weak are the ones
being bullied.''
	   The Philippines has one of the weakest militaries in Southeast
Asia and its navy relies on old ships donated by the United States.
	   An armed forces modernization program has been delayed because
of a tight budget.
	   Mercado said the Philippines will not start a fight over the
Spratlys. ``But we are also a nation that values our sovereignty
and territorial integrity _ with whatever we have, we will have to
defend it.''
	   He declined to elaborate on Manila's military options.
	   Mercado said China's occupation of the reef could threaten the
food security of the Philippines by reducing its access to fishery
resources.
	   ``What we are talking about here is our right to develop our own
resources, our marine resources,'' Mercado said, noting that fish
is the main source of protein for Filipinos.
	   Mischief Reef, called Panganiban by the Philippines, is about
150 miles (240 kilometers) west of the western Philippine island of
Palawan.
	   The Spratlys island group is claimed in whole or in part by the
Philippines, China, Taiwan, Vietnam, Brunei and Malaysia.
	   The Philippines occupies eight of the islands, including Pagasa,
the biggest.

Report: Former U.N. commander says some in U.S. undermined Bosnia
</HEADLINE>
mission &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ The former United Nations military commander in
Bosnia said some U.S. officials tried to undermine his effort to
lead the peacekeeping force, according to an interview published
Tuesday.
	   Gen. Sir Michael Rose, who led the force from 1994-95, also told
The Times that he suspected the Americans of bugging his
headquarters in Sarajevo because they thought he supported the
Serbs.
	   ``I wasn't pro-Serb or pro-Muslim, I was supposed to be the
mediator, not take sides, but I had to educate the Americans before
they understood what the mission in Bosnia was about,'' he was
quoted as saying.
	   Rose spoke of a U.S. Embassy official, a woman he did not
identify, as being the most hostile American he met in Bosnia. On a
helicopter flight over the Zvijezda mountains, the woman exclaimed
about the villages destroyed by ``the criminal Serbs.''
	   In fact, Rose said, they were Bosnian Croat villages which had
been overrun by Muslims.
	   Rose gave the interview to publicize ``Fighting for Peace,'' his
account of his year as commander of the peacekeeping mission.
	   Rose told the newspaper that when he asked the Americans if they
were bugging his office, ``they never denied it.''
	   While Rose said some people, whom he suspected to be Central
Intelligence Agency officers, threatened to undermine his work by
demanding ``tough military action against the Bosnian Serbs,'' he
had praise for the overall part the Americans played in negotiating
and maintaining peace.
	   Rose retired from the British Army in 1996.

Afghan opposition claims Taliban violate cease fire
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDs: IDENTIFIES distance of fighting from Afghan capital &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ Afghanistan's northern-based
opposition accused their Taliban enemies Tuesday of violating a
cease fire and attacking their positions north of the beleaguered
capital.
	   However, they said it wouldn't effect an agreement between
Afghanistan's two warring sides to continue with a prisoner
exchange.
	   The Taliban launched an offensive in Dasht-i-Archi, a district
in northern Kunduz province, some 250 kilometers (150 miles) north
of Kabul and resorted to heavy artillery fire in the Ghorband area
of central Parwan province, barely 60 kilometers (36 miles) from
the capital, opposition spokesman, who identified himself only as
Arif said.
	   There was no immediate comment from the Taliban militia.
	   Opposition fighters repulsed the Taliban attack in Kunduz
province, while in Parwan province they retaliated, he said.
	   The warring Afghan factions last month agreed to a cease fire
and prisoner exchange negotiated by Said Jalal, a close associate
of Saudi Arabian Crown Prince Abdullah.
	   ``In a country like Afghanistan, some violations of agreements
are possible. . . but it won't hurt the process of exchange of
prisoners,'' he said.
	   Representatives of the northern alliance will visit jails in the
Taliban headquarters in southern Kandahar later Tuesday. There they
will compile a list of their troops being held by the Taliban.
	   The two sides have agreed to exchange up to 3,000 prisoners.
	   The Taliban militia, which controls almost 90 percent of
Afghanistan including the capital Kabul, is facing fierce
resistance from Ahmed Shah Massood's Jamiat-e-Islami in the
remaining 10 percent of the country.
	   The Taliban, or students of Islam are Sunni Muslims and mostly
Pashtuns _ the majority ethnic group of Afghanistan.
	   They follow a harsh version of Islam that bars women from work
and education, forces men to wear beards and bans all light
entertainment including music.
	   The opposition comprise mainly of religious and ethnic
minorities including Shiites, Tajiks, Uzbeks and Hazaras.

Anti-abortion material sent to Canadian newspaper
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With US-Abortion Task Force &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   HAMILTON, Ontario (AP) _ Vancouver abortion clinics were put on
alert after another package containing anti-abortion messages and a
cryptic threat was sent to an Ontario newspaper.
	   The four-page package arrived Monday in the mail at the Hamilton
Spectator newspaper and contained the words: ``We continue this
righteous (war). Tactical meeting in Vancouver (Nov).''
	   It's not clear what the message meant, but it comes during the
Nov. 8-11 period in which three Canadian abortion doctors have been
shot since 1994.
	   It's the sixth message aimed at halting abortions that has been
delivered to the newspaper since December.
	   The newspaper said the handwriting on the envelope and contents
inside appear to match earlier parcels delivered to it by
anti-abortion activist James Kopp, 44, who is wanted for
questioning by U.S. police in the murder of Dr. Barnett Slepian.
	   Slepian, a Buffalo, New York, abortion doctor and obstetrician,
was shot to death by a sniper in his home Oct. 23.
	   Kopp was named in a Canadian immigration warrant last week after
police confirmed he had entered Canada. Authorities have also said
Kopp, of Vermont, was in Canada about the time of the attacks on
the Canadian doctors.
	   Vancouver police would not comment Monday but the city's three
abortion clinics were put on alert.
	   ``Certainly there is a great amount of fear here around this
issue. It's important to have people on alert for any possibility
of violence,'' said Joyce Arthur, of the coalition for Abortion
Clinics in British Columbia.
	   The large manila envelope, which was passed on to police, was
processed by the Canada Post plant in nearby Stoney Creek, a
facility that handles tens of thousands of pieces of mail a day
from southwestern Ontario.
	   The package contains Spectator clippings from Friday's newspaper
about the investigation into the Canadian and U.S. shootings.
	   Two of the pages contain sections of Spectator clippings that
deal with the investigation. Portions of the articles are
underlined or circled.
	   A third page shows a graphic picture of an aborted fetus.
	   Notes attached to the picture read: ``Would you do this to your
baby?'' A second note read: ``We continue this righteous (war).
Tactical meeting in Vancouver (Nov.)
	   Insp. Keith McCaskill, a spokesman for the nine-member
Canada-U.S. task force probing the sniper shootings, said
investigators were taking the package seriously. But he said police
did not know if there was a link between the messages and the
abortion sniper.

Rocket-propelled grenade explodes at Colombo airport
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) _ A rocket-propelled grenade was fired
accidentally by a Sri Lankan soldier at Colombo's international
airport Tuesday, causing panic but no damages or casualties, police
and airport officials said.
	   ``Some personnel from the air force were loading the grenades
when one of them got fired accidentally,'' said police official S.
Vijayasinghe.
	   The accident occurred on the Bandaranaike International
Airport's runway. The barrel was pointed towards the sky and the
grenade exploded in the air, Vijayasinghe said.
	   ``There was some confusion, but the incident did not affect any
flight. We are back to normal,'' said Airport Manager I.M. Rasheek.
The airport at Katunayaka, about 30 kilometers (19 miles) north of
Colombo, handles about 35 flights a day.
	   The airport is guarded by air force personnel to counter threats
from Tamil Tiger rebels who are battling the government for a
homeland for the minority Tamils.
	   The rebels were blamed for the Air Lanka plane bombing at the
airport in 1986 that killed 16 people.

Even diplomats are sometimes undiplomatic at the U.N.

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Even diplomats are sometimes undiplomatic.
	   U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan has been promoting ``New
Partnerships in Africa.'' So not surprisingly, more than 100 people
accepted an invitation to attend a briefing Monday highlighting how
the United Nations, voluntary groups and the African diaspora were
working together.
	   But after listening for an hour to four speeches on U.N.
projects and conferences on Africa at Columbia University in New
York and in Tokyo, Tanzania's Ambassador Daudi Mwakawago had had
enough.
	   ``I didn't hear anything about coordination,'' he said,
complaining that all that was being discussed were a proliferation
of projects ``whose end product is hard to quantify'' _ especially
to Africa's 700 million people, the majority living in poverty.
	   ``If somebody came from Mars and floated around here, I'm sure
their conclusion would be that there would be no development for
Africa,'' he said.
	   Annan, a Ghanaian, has been trying to promote peace and economic
development on the continent and has launched a Special Initiative
on Africa involving the entire U.N. system to try to coordinate
activities by the world body.
	   In the past year, half the worldwide deaths from conflict were
in Africa, and there was fighting in one in four countries.
Economically, nearly two-thirds of Africa's 53 states are at or
near the bottom of the world's economic development tables, and the
continent receives only a tiny percentage of global foreign
investment.
	   What angered ambassador Mwakawago was that in the talk of
education programs and the need for economic growth, little was
said about eliminating Africa's crippling foreign debt, which
consumes 30 to 40 percent of the national budget in many countries,
or new money for development.
	   ``Are we serious about African development?,'' the ambassador
asked. ``There's a lot of hype about the Special Initiative. But
it's only recycling existing resources. So what are we talking
about?''
	   ``By 2015, I don't see anything happening. There's going to be
more African studies programs and no development,'' he said.
	   Not everyone agreed with Mwakawago.
	   Daouda Toure, senior policy adviser for the Special Initiative
for Africa, said the United Nations is concerned about more
resources for the continent _ but he noted that past mismanagement
has turned off some potential aid donors.
	   African countries have to show the world that ``the right
government strategy is in place'' for their own development, he
said. ``I think coordination can only be successful if it's done by
the countries themselves.''
	   Wataru Nishigahiro, minister in Japan's U.N. Mission, admitted
that coordination is ``very difficult,'' citing the conference on
African development his country hosted last month for 80 countries
and 40 international organizations. He called for greater
``information sharing'' _ and more briefings like UNESCO's.
	   After the briefing, Richard A. Zeif, a New York lawyer on the
executive committee of voluntary organizations affiliated with the
United Nations, congratulated ambassador Mwakawago for pinpointing
the key issues _ money, debt servicing and a lack of coordination.
	   He blamed the lack of coordination on a turf war among U.N.
agencies involved in Africa, including the U.N. Educational,
Scientific and Cultural Organization, which organized the briefing.
	   ``So what you've really seen is further growth of bureaucracy,''
Zeif said.

Child sex offender suspect innocent on one charge; trial continues
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES and RECASTS with testimony from Bell, CORRECTS age to
64 in 4th graf &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Former millionaire businessman and
international fugitive Phillip Harold Bell admitted Tuesday to
sexual relationships with four youths, but denied he is a
pedophile.
	   Giving evidence at his trial on multiple child sex charges, Bell
described himself as a hebephile.
	   ``I'd like the hebephile relationship to be understood as a
rather beautiful relationship between a man and a youth which may
or may not have a sexual element to it,'' Bell told the New South
Wales state District Court.
	   ``There are tens of thousands of hebephiles in our society who
are good men. ... The central driving force of a hebephile
relationship is love.''
	   Bell, 64, who has pleaded innocent to 38 sex offenses involving
five boys aged in their early teens during the mid-1980s, said he
had loved and been loved by more than one youth ``over many, many
years.''
	   ``I tell you and I tell the world that a hebephile is not a
pedophile.''
	   Bell was acquitted Tuesday of one charge because of lack of
evidence.
	   He denied having any sexual contact with three of the
complainants, but admitted having sex with two, and with two other
witnesses, but at a later time than they said acts occurred.
	   Bell said his relationship with one of the witnesses began when
the youth was 16, which was illegal in Australia, where the age of
consent is 18 years, but not in Switzerland, where he took the
youth on a visit and where the age of consent is 16.
	   ``In that one specific relationship I was a criminal according
to (Australian) law but a perfectly ordinary gay guy according to
Swiss law,'' Bell said.
	   Bell was arrested last December in South Africa after fleeing
Australia. An international search lasting more than a year found
him running a surfing school at Jeffrey's Bay, on South Africa's
southern coast.
	   Bell was extradited back to Australia after spending nearly five
months in jail near Port Elizabeth.
	   Last month, chief prosecutor Mark Tedeschi said Bell had preyed
on vulnerable youths for his own sexual gratification, enticing
them with offers of cash for odd jobs and showering them with gifts
and privileges in return for sexual favors.

Thorpe, Ramprakash break touring record
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ADELAIDE, Australia (AP) _ Two rivals for a middle-order batting
position in England's test side have registered the highest
partnership by a touring cricket side in Australia.
	   England batsmen Graham Thorpe and Mark Ramprakash rewrote the
record books Tuesday with an unbroken 377-run partnership to ensure
a draw against South Australia on the final day of a four-day match
at Adelaide Oval.
	   The pair's feat eclipsed the previous best partnership by a
touring side in Australia, a 368-run stand between MCC batsmen
Wilfred Rhodes and C.A.G. Russell against South Australia at
Adelaide in 1920-21.
	   The record encompasses 113 tours to Australia in 136 years.
	   Thorpe amassed an unbeaten 223 and Ramprakash was not out 140
when bad light stopped play on the final day about 90 minutes
before scheduled stumps.
	   The duo scored 302 runs Tuesday in just over 4 1-2 hours, Thorpe
smashing his way from 100 to 200 in just 70 balls including 12
boundaries and four sixes in a sizzling display between lunch and
tea.
	   Thorpe's total was his highest first-class score, surpassing his
previous best by one run _ a 222 for Surrey against Glamorgan in
1997.
	   The lefthander took tablets to combat flu-like symptoms before
his stylish double century as England finished 457-4 against a
hapless South Australian bowling attack.
	   This Ashes tour is Thorpe's return from back problems that
required surgery after flaring in the West Indies earlier this year
and again during the test series against South Africa.
	   Ramprakash blossomed in the West Indies and against South Africa
but Thorpe's return places a squeeze on batting positions with John
Crawley the other contender for a middle order berth.
	   ``It was pleasing the back stood up to so long out there, it's
the longest I have spent at the crease since the operation,''
Thorpe said after his 380-minute innings.
	   Ramprakash, 29, said he had felt pressure on his position since
Thorpe's return.
	   ``I have played nine tests in a row and obviously I want to
continue that,'' the Middlesex strokeplayer said.
	   The first test in Brisbane starts on Nov. 20. (djp)

Israel and United States coordinate positions on Iraqi crisis
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By LAURIE COPANS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israel is closely following the new U.S.-Iraq
confrontation over weapons inspections and is being briefed by U.S.
defense officials, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Tuesday.
	   Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai and U.S. Defense
Secretary William Cohen spoke Monday to discuss the new crisis.
	   ``We're watching very carefully what is happening in the Gulf.
We are in constant touch with the United States,'' Netanyahu told
reporters. ``And we always take the necessary precautions for any
eventuality.''
	   The United States is considering using force against Iraq after
Iraqi President Saddam Hussein halted all cooperation last month
with U.N. inspectors searching for alleged stockpiles of chemical
and biological arms.
	   Mordechai told Cohen via a hot-line between their offices that
Israel supports the U.S. demand for the continuation of the
inspections so as to prevent the development of non-conventional
weapons in the region, Mordechai's office said.
	   Iraq fired 39 Scud missiles on Israel during the 1991 Gulf War.
	   Hussein has demanded the lifting of the international sanctions
that were clamped on Iraq after its invasion of Kuwait in 1990. But
the U.N. has insisted the punishments must be continued until the
weapons inspections are completed.

Newspaper apologizes for paying widower to pose with prostitutes
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ One of Hong Kong's most popular newspapers,
known for its aggressive investigative coverage, used all of page
one Tuesday to apologize for paying a widower 5,000 Hong Kong
dollars (U.S. dlrs 641) to pose with prostitutes.
	   The director of the Apple Daily, Jimmy Lai, wrote that although
the newspaper did not fabricate any news, it inappropriately and
``indirectly'' paid Chen Kin-hong and others to enhance its
coverage with staged photographs.
	   The Chinese-language newspaper did not disclose how Chen was
paid, and a secretary for Lai said her boss would have no further
comment.
	   Chen's wife jumped to her death after pushing their two sons
from their high-rise apartment building last month, and media
coverage of Chen has been sharply criticized by members of the
public and several journalism associations.
	   News reports said Chen's wife was upset about his visits to
prostitutes in mainland China _ and Apple Daily soon came out with
pictures that purportedly showed him with prostitutes.
	   Apple Daily and Lai are no strangers to controversy _ although
the latest flap centered around bad taste rather than any problems
with the Chinese government.
	   When Hong Kong reverted to China from Britain last year, there
had been widespread concerns about censorship or self-censorship in
the territory's free-wheeling press, but Lai's publications, Next
magazine and Apple Daily, have continued to aggressively report on
sensitive issues, including corruption and social unrest in China.
	   Lai ran into trouble with Chinese authorities in 1994 after
writing an editorial calling then Chinese Premier Li Peng a
``turtle egg,'' a scathing insult in Chinese. China closed a branch
of a clothing store that Lai operated in the mainland, saying the
business had not been registered properly.

Dollar climbs, Japanese stocks fall in thin trading
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Wraps up with late dollar, closing bond, other details &QL; 
 &UR; AP Photos TOK102-103 &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The U.S. dollar climbed to its highest level in a
month against the yen Tuesday amid optimism that global financial
markets are stabilizing. Japanese stock prices fell in thin
trading.
	   The dollar bought 122.32 yen in late afternoon, up 2.96 yen from
late Monday in Tokyo and also above its late New York level of
121.57 yen overnight. It now has gained a total of 6.62 yen in
Tokyo's last five trading days.
	   On Tuesday, the dollar ranged between 121.42 yen and 122.70 yen,
its highest level since Oct. 8.
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average fell 86.45 points,
or 0.61 percent, closing at 14,108.09. On Monday, the index had
gained 72.57 points, or 0.51 percent.
	   In currency dealings, the dollar rose on buying by Japanese
trust banks and institutional investors as fears of U.S. financial
instability receded, traders said.
	   Dollar-buying was also prompted by the growing notion that the
U.S. Federal Reserve is unlikely to cut interest rates at its Nov.
17 meeting.
	   ``Traders as well as investors are beginning to feel safe again
about investing in dollar-denominated assets,'' said Yukihiko
Hashimoto, senior manager of foreign exchange trading at Sanwa
Bank.
	   For weeks, investors had feared U.S. hedge funds were poised to
further unwind long, or overbought, dollar positions.
	   Also supporting the dollar was mounting tension over the
standoff between the United Nations and Iraq, traders said.
	   Iraq has refused to cooperate with the U.N. inspection team on
chemical and biological weapons, and the United States is
considering options, including air strikes, to force Baghdad to
comply.
	   The dollar is often regarded as a safe haven in times of
international unrest.
	   On the stock market, share prices climbed in the morning on
buying of export-oriented issues, encouraged by the yen's weakening
trend against the dollar.
	   A strong dollar tends to increase earnings of Japanese exporters
when they repatriate overseas profits into yen.
	   But the market fell in the afternoon in thin trading, with many
players holding back before the government draws up economic
stimulus measures on Nov. 16.
	   Yasuo Ueki, general manager at Nikko Securities Co., said the
market was in an ``adjustment phase'' after rallying for five
consecutive trading sessions in late October.
	   Declines outnumbered advances 681 to 395, with 187 issues
unchanged. An estimated 370 million shares changed hands on the
first section, up from Monday's 290 million.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section was down 5.84 points, or 0.54 percent, to 1,078.32.
It had fallen 5.31 points, or 0.49 percent, the previous day.
	   The yield on the benchmark No. 203 10-year Japanese government
bond fell to 0.815 percent from Monday's finish of 0.825 percent,
driving its price up to 108.76 yen from 108.67 yen.

More public school teachers join strike for better pensions
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ Some 26,000 teachers at state-run
intermediate and primary schools joined high school teachers
Tuesday in a two-day strike to press for better pensions, leaving a
total of about 275,000 students without classes.
	   The teachers are demanding end-of-service compensation to be
calculated on the basis of their last full salaries. The government
proposed and the Parliament approved last month pensions equal to
85 percent of the last income.
	   In Lebanon, retirement pay is generally given in one lump sum,
called end-of-service compensation, in which the worker receives a
payment equal to one month's pay _ or a percentage of the pay _ for
each year worked.
	   Teachers at private schools and universities have not joined the
strike.
	   On Monday, about 4,000 teachers at public high schools across
the country walked out of classrooms for an open-ended strike.
	   The strike affected 193 public schools, forcing more than 65,000
high school students to stay at home.
	   The government, strapped by a budget deficit and debt, has
already said it cannot afford to meet the demands.
	   Teachers' pay varies greatly depending on education and
experience. Monthly salaries run from dlrs 250 to dlrs 1,000 in
public schools and from dlrs 550 to dlrs 1,000 in private ones.

 &UR; Jordanian Prime Minister in Saudi for talks on Iraq crisis

<TEXT>
	   RIYADH, Saudi Arabia (AP) _ Jordanian Prime Minister Fayez
Tarawneh arrived here Tuesday for talks on Iraq's standoff with the
United Nations and the possible resumption of Saudi oil supplies to
the kingdom.
	   Tarawneh will meet with Saudi King Fahd and Crown Prince
Abdullah later Tuesday and discuss ways of ``coordinating policies
over the situation between Iraq and the United Nations,'' said a
Jordanian diplomat speaking on condition of anonymity.
	   Jordan's state-run Petra News Agency said Tarawneh will deliver
a ``written message'' to Saudi King Fahd from King Hussein, who is
receiving cancer treatment in the United States.
	   It did not disclose the contents of the message, but said it was
related to ``bilateral relations and recent developments in the
region and the world.''
	   Information Minister Nasser Judeh told reporters on Monday that
Tarawneh has ``no fixed agenda'' in Saudi Arabia, but suggested his
talks would focus on the Iraq crisis.
	   Other officials said Jordan will ask Saudi Arabia for resumed
oil supplies if an Iraqi confrontation with the west cuts Jordan's
energy lifeline from Baghdad.
	   The Saudis had agreed to resume supplies to Jordan during Iraq's
latest confrontation with the United Nations in February.
	   Jordan receives all its daily requirement of 90,000 barrels of
crude and fuel oil trucked across a desert border from Iraq under a
special arrangement approved by the United Nations Sanctions
Committee.
	   The supplies are exempt from sweeping international sanctions
slapped on Baghdad following its August 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
	   Jordan's Crown Prince Hassan, who is acting as regent while the
king is away, told U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen last week
in Amman that Jordan favored a diplomatic solution to the Iraqi
standoff.
	   The United States and Britain have warned Iraq of a strike if it
failed to rescind its decision to end cooperation with United
Nations weapons inspectors.
	   Iraq accuses the weapons inspectors of being biased and, under
pressure from the Americans, of prolonging the U.N. sanctions on
Iraq by refusing to certify the country has eliminated its weapons
of mass destruction.

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Despite a massive security clampdown
across the capital, protests and street confrontations Tuesday
marred the opening of a government assembly convened to carve out a
new political future for crisis-ridden Indonesia.
	   The People's Consultative Assembly met at the national
Parliament, guarded by thousands of armed troops and surrounded by
razor wire.
	   A few kilometers (miles) away, hundreds of pro-government
activists confronted 5,000 anti-government student protesters on a
busy road near the University of Indonesia.
	   Outside the legislature, rival groups, some armed with sticks,
jeered and threw rocks at each other. Troops blocked off a toll
road, but made no arrests.
	   Critics doubt that the 1,000-member assembly, Indonesia's
highest legislative body, will deliver on promises to dismantle the
32-year-old authoritarian legacy of former President Suharto, who
quit in May after a wave of deadly riots and protests.
	   However, Parliament Speaker Harmoko, once a dogmatic and loyal
Suharto supporter, warned that anarchy could engulf the world's
fourth most populous nation unless fundamental political changes
were made to meet the reform demands of 202 million Indonesians.
	   The assembly meets as Indonesia grapples with its worst economic
crisis in decades.
	   Inflation and unemployment are soaring, and millions of people
are sinking into poverty. Rioting and looting have occurred
sporadically for months in many areas.
	   The assembly's main job is to set a date sometime in late May
for parliamentary elections and to help frame new laws to legalize
free political parties.
	   ``We regard the general election as the best way for the people
to determine their own future in a democratic manner,'' Harmoko
said.
	   Harmoko said the assembly, made up of 475 legislators and 625
government appointees, would revoke old decrees that preserved
special presidential powers during the Suharto era. It would also
promote human rights and clean government.
	   In a sign of compromise, military chief Gen. Wiranto has said
that the armed forces are willing to discuss demands to limit their
prominent role in politics, which now gives them a guaranteed 75
seats in the 500-member Parliament.
	   One proposal is to cut its representation down to 55 seats.
	   Despite promises of change, opponents claim most of the
assembly's members are holdovers from the Suharto era.
	   With Indonesia's main opposition figures not part of the
assembly, critics fear it will try to bolster the position of
current President B.J. Habibie.
	   Habibie, a longtime friend and former loyal aide of Suharto,
plans to stand as a presidential candidate next year.
	   Habibie was applauded warmly when he attended Tuesday's opening
session. But he did not speak so as to avoid giving the impression
that he was trying to sway the delegates.
	   In a show of discontent, Indonesia's three main opposition
figures held a closed-door meeting in south Jakarta.
	   At a rally earlier Tuesday, hundreds of students called on the
assembly to disband. They also demanded that Habibie quit and that
the military get out of politics altogether.
	   They also called for Suharto to be tried for corruption.
	   About 30,000 troops and police have been deployed across Jakarta
to safeguard the four-day assembly meeting.
	   Additionally, an estimated 120,000 civilian guards, many of them
in their teens, have been recruited to help keep the peace.
	   In a statement, the New York-based Human Rights Watch said the
guards are not disciplined and pose a threat to public order in
their opposition to student groups.

	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Share prices in Hong Kong closed lower Tuesday
on continued profit-taking.
	   The blue-chip Hang Seng Index fell 130.60 points, or 1.3
percent, closing at 9,721.33. On Monday, the index had slumped
287.82 points.
	   Turnover amounted to 5.97 billion Hong Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs
765 million), little changed from Monday's 5.72 billion Hong Kong
dollars (U.S. dlrs 733 million).
	   Brokers said investors continued to take profits because the
index had gained more than 30 percent since the end of September.
	   They said the Hong Kong market was also pushed down by overnight
falls on Wall Street, where the Dow Jones industrial average sank
77.50 points to 8,897.96.
	   Among properties, Sun Hung Kai Properties fell 2.00 Hong Kong
dollars to 48.00, and Cheung Kong fell 75 cents to 52.25.
	   In the banking sector, HSBC Holdings fell 4.00 dollars to

	   Elsewhere, China Light fell 60 cents to 39.80, and Hong Kong

	   TOKYO (AP) _ South Korea and Thailand are over the worst of the
Asian economic crisis, but grinding poverty still stands in the way
of recovery in Indonesia, the president of the World Bank said
Tuesday.
	   ``We've come a long way in Korea and Thailand in building the
economic and financial base ... to try to stabilize the economic
situation,'' James Wolfensohn told reporters in Tokyo.
	   The two countries have largely overcome the ``worst excesses''
of problems of interest rates, foreign reserves and lack of credit,
he said.
	   Indonesia, however, is making slower progress, in part because
it was poorer than South Korea and Thailand before the Asian
financial crisis hit last year, Wolfensohn said.
	   For example, 60 million Indonesians are surviving on just dlrs 2
a day, while another 15 million scrape by on a daily budget of dlr
1 or less, he said. Private debt to foreign creditors also totals
dlrs 60 billion.
	   ``It's quite hard with that background to make an immediate jump
forward,'' he said.
	   Despite those problems, Wolfensohn said the monetary and
financial situations in Indonesia are ``being brought into a better
alignment.''
	   Wolfensohn, scheduled to go to Russia on Thursday, was in Japan
for talks with government officials on approaches to the expanding
global economic slowdown.

	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Singapore's economy is technically in recession
and could contract as much as 1 percent in 1999, the Ministry of
Trade and Industry said Tuesday.
	   ``On a quarter-on-quarter basis, (gross domestic product) shrank
for the second consecutive quarter, signaling that the economy is
in a technical recession,'' the ministry said.
	   Two back-to-back quarters of negative growth is generally
accepted as the definition of a recession.
	   The government also revised the economic growth forecast for
1998 to 0.5 percent to 1 percent, down from an earlier forecast of
0.5 to 1.5 percent. It predicted the economy in 1999 will hover
between a 1.0 percent contraction and 1.0 percent growth.
	   The government said Singapore's GDP contracted by 0.7 percent in
the third quarter, compared with a year earlier. This is the first
time that the economy has shrunk on a year-on-year basis since the
first quarter of 1986.
	   The economy grew by 7.8 percent in 1997. Though the economic
crisis hit Southeast Asia in July 1997, it took time for
reverberations to reach affluent Singapore.

	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ South Korea's parliament will open a
potentially divisive probe next month into alleged mishandling of
the country's economic crisis.
	   President Kim Dae-jung, who leads the ruling coalition, met with
Lee Hoi-chang, head of the main opposition Grand National Party,
Tuesday and agreed to start the hearing in the single-chamber
National Assembly on Dec. 8.
	   South Korea plunged into financial turmoil late last year while
the current opposition party was in power. President Kim, who won
election in December, has vowed to punish state economic planners.
	   The hearing was expected to trigger a heated debate on whether
policy failures should be subject to criminal punishment and
whether former President Kim Young-sam should be called to testify.
	   Two top economic advisers to the ex-president are already on
trial on charges of mishandling the crisis.
	   ___
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Hoping to pull Japan out of recession, the ruling
party and a major opposition force have agreed on a plan to offer
shopping vouchers to eligible consumers, a spokesman said Tuesday.
	   Mitsuyoshi Mizoguchi, of the New Komeito party, said his party
and the ruling Liberal Democrats have agreed ``in principle'' on
the plan. The New Komeito is the second largest opposition party.
	   The idea is to give shopping vouchers to families with children,
aged 15 or younger, and to individual senior citizens, as a way to
prod tight-fisted consumers to help Japan spend its way out of a
nagging economic downturn.
	   But Mizoguchi said the two parties have yet to narrow
differences over whether all people 65 and older should be eligible
or even how much to provide.
	   Local media reports say each eligible person would receive
20,000 yen (dlrs 165) worth of coupons.
	   ___
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ The Philippine government is ready to
give up its stake in ailing Philippine Airlines and will not infuse
any additional capital if a new investor, possibly Cathay Pacific
Airways, comes in, officials said Tuesday.
	   ``Our objective is full privatization. The government's policy
is to be out of the company that is being privatized,'' Finance
Secretary Edgardo Espiritu said.
	   PAL is negotiating with Cathay Pacific, which could buy up to 40
percent of the airline under Philippine law.
	   Cathay Pacific has said it wants management control of the
Philippine flag carrier, which has been mired in debt and labor
unrest. A PAL official has said it is willing to give Cathay
Pacific management control.
	   Several Manila newspapers reported Tuesday that Cathay Pacific
also is demanding that the government divest its shares in PAL
before it will agree to conclude a deal with the airline.
	   PAL executive vice president Manolo Aquino said there was no
such demand, adding that the government's shares in PAL will
naturally be diluted once a deal is forged and Cathay Pacific puts
in new capital.
	   President Joseph Estrada said he would agree to any setup in PAL
as long as it remains the country's flag carrier.
	   ___
	   SUVA, Fiji (AP) _ Plans to exploit turn-of-the-millennium
celebrations as a free global promotion for Pacific Island nations
have flopped, following the collapse of a joint planning and
marketing body.
	   The Tourism Council of the South Pacific, representing tourist
offices for 13 Pacific Island nations, said Tuesday it had quit a
regional consortium formed in 1996 to coordinate millennium events
so as to avoid clashes and rivalries likely to undermine
promotional hopes.
	   Instead, rivalry for an anticipated flood of visitors to
countries located near the International Date Line at the 180th
meridian has completely undermined the South Pacific Millennium
Consortium, according to a report by the council.
	   Fiji, Tonga, Kiribati and Samoa are among Pacific nations which
are trying to capitalize on their location to claim they are among
the first places in the world to greet the year 2000 _ and, in the
case of countries east of the line, the last to farewell 1999.
	   Turn-of-the-millennium planning in the Pacific includes
expectation of a massive influx of tourists and of global live
television coverage.
	   The council's report said the consortium had been ``throttled by
a number of influences.''
	   It said that in 1997 only 11 of 18 consortium members paid their
contributions to its budget. By August this year none had paid, and
work is being funded by unspent money from previous years and
T-shirt sales. The consortium had a Fiji dollars 788 (U.S. dlrs
394) bank overdraft.
	   Fiji, Samoa, Tonga, and the Cook Islands, all able to market
their Date Line locations as places offering opportunities to enter
2000 up to 12 hours ahead of the rest of the world and then skip
eastwards across the line, back a calendar day to enjoy a second
millennium eve, were ruthlessly selling themselves and treating
each other as rivals, the report says.

Officer says police coerced retractions in Anwar case

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ A police official testified
Tuesday that he had coerced two key witnesses into retracting
sexual misconduct allegations against Anwar Ibrahim, allegedly on
orders from the former deputy prime minister himself.
	   Anwar's trial on sex and corruption charges has captured
worldwide attention. He was once in line to rule this country of 22
million people, but is now seeking to ward off a lengthy prison
term and political oblivion.
	   The trial stems in part from Anwar's clash with his one-time
mentor, Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad. During a recess in
Tuesday's proceedings, Anwar was asked his reaction to the decision
by U.S. President Bill Clinton and Canadian Prime Minister Jean
Chretien to snub private talks with Mahathir during a trade summit
next week.
	   ``Mahathir should consider it (the snub) serious. Even foreign
leaders reject him,'' Anwar told a small group of reporters, adding
that Malaysians themselves have rejected their 71-year-old leader.
	   As Anwar spoke, about 100 supporters were jostling for position
at a mosque across from the courthouse, hoping to catch a glimpse
of him on his way out of court.
	   Tuesday's testimony focused on statements by Ummi Hafilda, who
said Anwar had sex with the wife of his own personal secretary.
Ummi is the secretary's sister.
	   The court was also considering statements by Azizan Abu Bakar,
who served as Anwar's driver and claimed the defendant committed
sodomy with him.
	   Both later retracted their allegations, in what prosecutors
claim was a deliberate cover-up attempt by Anwar while he was still
in power as deputy prime minister.
	   Abdul Aziz Husin of the police Special Branch testified that he
and other officers subjected Ummi ``to intense mental pressures''
in getting her to retract the allegations.
	   That included interrogation ``from midnight to morning'' and
threats to jail her under a law that allows for indefinite
detention without trial.
	   ``These combined approaches subjected her to intense mental
pressures until she lost the will to resist and succumbed to the
interrogation team,'' Abdul Aziz told the court.
	   Abdul Aziz said he and other officers used similar techniques on
Azizan, the driver who claimed to have committed sodomy with Anwar.
	   The trial has become a point of contention with Malaysia about
to play host to a summit of Asia-Pacific leaders, including U.S.
President Bill Clinton, next week. Critics say the trial and
allegations that police beat the 51-year-old Anwar highlight the
country's human rights abuses.
	   Anwar, dressed casually in a white shirt with no tie, sat in the
defendant's dock and appeared unmoved by Tuesday's testimony. He is
being held in prison, possibly for the duration of the trial.
	   Separately, Anwar's wife, Azizah Ismail, read a statement to
reporters from her husband, denying reports that he has a
controlling interest in a company whose name has surfaced during
the investigations against him.
	   Last week, the first witness, former Special Branch Chief
Mohamed Said Awang, testified that Anwar had forced police to
arrest and coerce retractions from the two.
	   Anwar was arrested Sept. 20, two weeks after he was fired by
Prime Minister Mahathir, setting off anti-government protests.
Anwar has pleaded innocent to 10 charges of corruption and illegal
sex acts.
	   Dozens of diplomats, international human rights and jurist
groups are sitting in on the trial, which is expected to last well
into next year.
	   The proceedings have created friction between Malaysia and some
of the 20 leaders who will take part in a summit of the Asia
Pacific Economic Cooperation group in Kuala Lumpur Nov. 17-18.
	   Denying the charges against him, Anwar has said they were
fabricated because Prime Minister Mahathir considered Anwar's
popularity a threat to his 17-year rule.

Mbeki says warns corruption infecting new government
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By PAUL HARRIS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) _ Deputy President Thabo Mbeki on
Tuesday said corruption was infecting the new governors of
post-apartheid South Africa.
	   With a national election looming next year, Mbeki, who is the
annointed successor to President Nelson Mandela, has made tackling
corruption a priority in recent speeches.
	   In one of his strongest attacks so far, Mbeki told delegates at
an anti-corruption conference that the legacy of corruption and
government privilege left by white rule was still pervasive.
	   ``The illusion of the sumptuous life made possible by profits
from illicit practises has taken its toll on the very proponents of
the new order,'' he said.
	   Opposition parties have made corruption one of their main
weapons in attacking the record of the African National
Congress-dominated government, which won power in 1994's all-race
elections that ended apartheid.
	   The issue is likely to be a key battleground in the coming
election, scheduled for some time after April 1999.
	   Mbeki warned there would be ``zero tolerance'' for corrupt
officials in public service or the private sector and called on
ordinary citizens to pay their share by not dodging taxes.
	   Under racist white rule, many blacks refused to pay taxes or
utility bills to a government that oppressed them. The government
since has faced problems in trying to persuade people to settle
their bills.
	   Mbeki said the whole country had to pull together to fight
corruption or democracy itself would be under threat.
	   ``Large sections of the citizenry as well have been engulfed by
the corrupting tentacles of this wayward beast that is threatening
to destroy the soul of our nation and the very basis of our
democracy,'' he said.
	   After two years of investigation, a special government
commission chaired by Judge William Heath has uncovered 92,600
cases of corruption involving losses of more than 6.2 billion rand
(dlrs 1.1 billion). The unit has recovered about 640 million rand
(dlrs 114 million).

China bullying Philippines, says Manila defense chief

	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ China is increasing its military
presence in the Spratlys to bully the Philippines because of
Manila's weak armed forces, Defense Secretary Orlando Mercado said
Tuesday.
	   Mercado said Chinese construction work at a disputed reef in the
South China Sea appears to have military purposes and is not only
to build shelters for fishermen as claimed by China.
	   Last week, Manila delivered a diplomatic protest to Beijing over
the expansion of the concrete platforms it built in 1995 at
Mischief Reef, in the disputed Spratly island group in the South
China Sea.
	   Mercado showed reporters pictures of large wooden barracks being
built on stilts on a concrete foundation adjacent to a cluster of
concrete platforms on the two-by-four-mile (three-by-six-kilometer)
reef.
	   The pictures also showed dozens of workers. Military officers
say the barracks could house 60 to 70 people.
	   President Joseph Estrada said Tuesday he plans to take up the
issue with Chinese President Jiang Zemin on the sidelines of a
meeting of Asia-Pacific leaders in Malaysia next week.
	   ``We will do it through negotiations. Let us not be
confrontational, you know we cannot afford to,'' he said.
	   A Chinese official on Tuesday reiterated China's position that
it is only repairing wind shelters for fishermen.
	   ``The reaction by the Philippines is not appropriate,'' said Zhu
Bangzao, a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman.
	   He said the repairs were ``completely within China's sovereign
rights'' and for peaceful purposes.
	   Mercado said the Chinese were like wolves marking off their
territory by leaving their scent.
	   ``It is obvious that they are establishing a military
presence,'' Mercado said. ``The obvious reason they are doing this
to us is we are weak. To put it bluntly, the weak are the ones
being bullied.''
	   The Philippines has one of the weakest militaries in Southeast
Asia and its navy relies on old ships donated by the United States.
	   An armed forces modernization program has been delayed because
of a tight budget.
	   Mercado said the Philippines will not start a fight over the
Spratlys. ``But we are also a nation that values our sovereignty
and territorial integrity _ with whatever we have, we will have to
defend it.''
	   He declined to elaborate on Manila's military options.
	   Mercado said China's occupation of the reef could threaten the
food security of the Philippines by reducing its access to fishery
resources.
	   ``What we are talking about here is our right to develop our own
resources, our marine resources,'' Mercado said, noting that fish
is the main source of protein for Filipinos.
	   Mischief Reef, called Panganiban by the Philippines, is about
150 miles (240 kilometers) west of the western Philippine island of
Palawan.
	   The Spratlys island group is claimed in whole or in part by the
Philippines, China, Taiwan, Vietnam, Brunei and Malaysia.
	   The Philippines occupies eight of the islands, including Pagasa,
the biggest.

EU opens enlargement talks amid anxiety about slowness of the

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ The European Union opens membership
talks with six nations Tuesday amid anxiety about the slowness of
admitting newcomers.
	   In the case of divided Cyprus, some EU members wonder if it
should be admitted at all.
	   The EU foreign ministers meet with their counterparts from
Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic, Slovenia, Estonia and Cyprus,
countries in the lead after preliminary expansion talks that began
in March.
	   Bringing up the rear are Lithuania, Latvia, Slovakia, Romania
and Bulgaria.
	   Ahead of Tuesday's meeting there were complaints about the EU's
handling of its most ambitious expansion drive to date.
	   In a rare joint statement on Monday, the Netherlands, Germany
and France said the inability of Greek and Turkish Cypriots to
reconcile their differences weighed heavily on their island's
membership chances.
	   And the leaders of Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia, at a meeting
in Oslo, complained the EU moved so slowly it could cause
instability in their region.
	   The EU has set no date for its eastward expansion. But the most
successful candidates may join as early as 2003 or 2004.
	   Lithuanian Prime Minister Gediminas Vagnorious warned of
``unnecessary tensions'' that could complicate relations with
Russia and other neighbors unless the EU accelerates its screening
of candidates.
	   Formal membership negotiations with Cyprus and five East
European nations open several days after the European Commission,
in a fist-thick assessment report declared the expansion drive
``broadly on track.''
	   It said all 11 candidates were pursuing economic and political
reforms to get in shape for EU membership.
	   The Commission said Latvia, Lithuania and Slovakia are doing the
job so well they may be advanced to the group of fast-track
candidates as of 1999.
	   At a regular foreign ministers meeting Monday, the EU broadly
endorsed the commission's findings.
	   Even so, French Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine cautioned
against advancing countries from the slower group saying that could
only widen the gap for Romania and Bulgaria which perform at the
bottom of the list of membership criteria.
	   ``We must be careful not to create new fractures,'' Vedrine told
reporters.
	   Vedrine issued a statement with Jozias van Aartsen and Joschka
Fischer, the Dutch and German foreign ministers, saying the
continued division of Cyprus raised the unacceptable prospect of
the EU importing Greek-Turkish rivalry into its ranks.
	   ``It has so far not been possible to find a political solution
for the continued division of Cyprus,'' the three countries said.
	   They spoke of ``fundamental problems'' in the negotiating
process, adding ``a political solution is urgently required.''
	   Sources said the Netherlands, France and Germany fear once Greek
Cypriots have joined the EU, the pressure will be off them _ and
Greece _ to seek a reunification of Cyprus and may seek to keep
Turkish Cypriots out of the EU.
	   Turkey invaded the northern one-third of Cyprus in 1974,
installed a government it only recognizes and still maintains
30,000 troops there.

Beijing dissidents set up opposition party; organizers reported
</HEADLINE>
missing &QL; 
 &UR; By ELAINE KURTENBACH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Defying a government ban, dissidents have started
a branch of an unauthorized opposition party in Beijing and
Tianjin, a leader of the group said Tuesday.
	   Two Beijing dissidents, one of whom was associated with the
China Democracy Party, were summoned by police for questioning
Tuesday, and two others had disappeared, possibly into police
custody, said veteran activist Xu Wenli.
	   Police led away Xu's assistant, Zhang Hui, Tuesday afternoon.
Wang Zhixin, a Beijing dissident who recently attempted to declare
his candidacy for the city legislature, was questioned and
released, Xu said.
	   Xu protested Zhang's detention, saying he would go to the police
and demand his aide's release if he was not let go by Tuesday
evening.
	   Cha Jianguo, a vice chairman of the Beijing-Tianjin branch of
the China Democracy Party, went missing Tuesday afternoon, and Lu
Honglai, another vice chairman, had not been heard from since he
left his home in Tianjin on Monday, Xu said.
	   Authorities have rejected efforts to register the party in
Beijing and other regions, which would challenge the Communist
Party's monopoly on power. Many associated with the group,
including Xu, have been interrogated by police and warned to stop
their involvement.
	   Defying those warnings, six dissidents including Xu and Lu
issued a statement late Monday declaring that they had set up a
party branch.
	   The statement said that since China lacked a law governing
political parties, there was no need to register with the
government.
	   The government requires all organizations to register.
Applications by political groups usually are rejected.
	   A ``temporary party charter'' issued by the group called for an
end to the communist ``one-party dictatorship'' and a new
government that would protect human rights and freedoms.
	   Its platform declared that members would promote justice, human
rights, private enterprise, fair economic competition, the planting
of forests and environmental protection, freedom of religion,
autonomy for areas inhabited by ethnic groups and peaceful
reunification between China and Taiwan, which Beijing considers a
renegade province.
	   Xu, who was named chairman of the group, said police also had
stepped up surveillance of his home.
	   With many other dissidents exiled abroad, Xu, 56, is one of the
most prominent democracy campaigners left in China. He was jailed
after the Democracy Wall protest movement of the late 1970s and
freed in 1993, having served all but three years of a 15-year
sentence, much of it in solitary confinement.
	   Lu Honglai, a fellow Democracy Wall activist, spent three years
in a labor camp.
	   Last month, he published an underground journal of writings by
dissidents that had drawn the attention of the authorities, the
Information Center of Human Rights and Democratic Movement in
China, a Hong Kong-based group, said Tuesday.

House leadership races still unsettled as Gingrich calls for unity
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photos AXWX101-103 &QL;

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ With the new House Republican leadership
lineup still unclear, retiring House Speaker Newt Gingrich is
calling for Republican unity in the next Congress so the party can
continue to push its ``big ideas.''
	   With heir apparent Rep. Bob Livingston of Louisiana looking on,
Gingrich addressed a hotel ballroom packed with Republican
loyalists Monday night in a speech that was part nostalgia, part
defense of his four years as speaker and part roadmap for what
looms as a challenging 1999 for the Republicans.
	   ``We never had a big majority, but we always stood for big
ideas. And that is what made us different,'' Gingrich told about
250 listeners at a dinner held by GOPAC, the Republican
fund-raising and candidate recruitment group he once headed.
	   ``And let me say that if every Republican will pull together
with Bob Livingston, these big ideas will continue to move us
forward,'' he added.
	   Gingrich's 45-minute speech, marked by several standing
ovations, was his first since he stunned the political world last
Friday by abdicating the speakership, following an election that
nearly cost his party its House majority.
	   When the new Congress convenes in January, the Republicans will
have a 223-211 House majority, plus an independent who usually
votes with Democrats. That means that just six Republican defectors
will be enough to defeat any party initiative.
	   Before the speech began, Livingston strode into the room with
his wife, Bonnie, to a standing ovation from the guests. Livingston
and Gingrich, longtime friends, smiled broadly as they shook hands
and patted each other on the shoulders, and then sat across from
each other at the same table.
	   Hours earlier, Livingston all but ensured that he will succeed
Gingrich when his only announced opponent, Rep. Christopher Cox of
California, withdrew from the race. During the speech, Gingrich
referred to Livingston, the 55-year-old chairman of the House
Appropriations Committee, as ``the next speaker of the House.''
	   The contest for House majority leader, the No. 2 House
Republican job, was still raging. The current leader, Rep. Dick
Armey of Texas, was fighting for the post against Reps. Steve
Largent of Oklahoma, the conservative and former football star, and
Jennifer Dunn of Washington, who is more moderate.
	   Republicans said Rep. Howard P. ``Buck'' McKeon of California,
intends to enter the race. His office said an announcement was set
for Tuesday.
	   The third-ranking House Republican, Rep. Tom DeLay of Texas, was
unopposed.
	   Rep. John Boehner of Ohio, the No. 4 leader, is being challenged
by Rep. J.C. Watts of Oklahoma, the House's only black Republican.
Rep. George Radanovich of California withdrew from the contest late
Monday and endorsed Watts.
	   But for one night, the focus shifted from those leadership races
to Gingrich, whose strategizing pushed the House Republicans into
majority status in the 1994 elections after four decades in the
minority.
	   The evening echoed those initial, hectic days in late 1994 and
early 1995 when he first captured the public eye. The audience
boisterously chanted ``Newt, Newt, Newt,'' while Gingrich quoted
futurist authors and even flashed his old, laminated copy of the
``Contract With America,'' the party's 1994 campaign document that
promised House votes on tax cuts, a welfare overhaul and eight
other issues.
	   He said little about his future, other than pledging to be an
active citizen. By remaining in Congress, he said he would be ``an
excuse for divisiveness and factionalism. The ideas are too big,
the issues are too important for any one person to put their office
above the good of the country and the party.''
	   He called on President Bill Clinton to use projected budget
surpluses to set up investment accounts people could use to bolster
their Social Security pensions. He called for tax cuts and for
improved education, drug fighting and anti-missile defenses. And he
vilified Vice President Al Gore, Democrats and trial lawyers.
	   Gingrich even poignantly spoke of the Republican debacle that
was last Tuesday's voting.
	   ``I can't pretend to any of you that I saw it coming, because
frankly I thought I was in one world at 6 o'clock and was in a
different world by midnight,'' said Gingrich, who had predicted
significant Republican gains in the midterm voting.

Officer says police coerced retractions in Anwar case

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ A police official testified
Tuesday that he had coerced two key witnesses into retracting
sexual misconduct allegations against Anwar Ibrahim, allegedly on
orders from the former deputy prime minister himself.
	   Anwar's trial on sex and corruption charges has captured
worldwide attention. He was once in line to rule this country of 22
million people, but is now seeking to ward off a lengthy prison
term and political oblivion.
	   The trial stems in part from Anwar's clash with his one-time
mentor, Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad. During a recess in
Tuesday's proceedings, Anwar was asked his reaction to the decision
by U.S. President Bill Clinton and Canadian Prime Minister Jean
Chretien to snub private talks with Mahathir during a trade summit
next week.
	   ``Mahathir should consider it (the snub) serious. Even foreign
leaders reject him,'' Anwar told a small group of reporters, adding
that Malaysians themselves have rejected their 72-year-old leader.
	   As Anwar spoke, about 100 supporters were jostling for position
at a mosque across from the courthouse, hoping to catch a glimpse
of him on his way out of court.
	   Tuesday's testimony focused on statements by Ummi Hafilda, who
said Anwar had sex with the wife of his own personal secretary.
Ummi is the secretary's sister.
	   The court was also considering statements by Azizan Abu Bakar,
who served as Anwar's driver and claimed the defendant committed
sodomy with him.
	   Both later retracted their allegations, in what prosecutors
claim was a deliberate cover-up attempt by Anwar while he was still
in power as deputy prime minister.
	   Abdul Aziz Husin of the police Special Branch testified that he
and other officers subjected Ummi ``to intense mental pressures''
in getting her to retract the allegations.
	   That included interrogation ``from midnight to morning'' and
threats to jail her under a law that allows for indefinite
detention without trial.
	   ``These combined approaches subjected her to intense mental
pressures until she lost the will to resist and succumbed to the
interrogation team,'' Abdul Aziz told the court.
	   Abdul Aziz said he and other officers used similar techniques on
Azizan, the driver who claimed to have committed sodomy with Anwar.
	   The trial has become a point of contention with Malaysia about
to play host to a summit of Asia-Pacific leaders, including U.S.
President Bill Clinton, next week. Critics say the trial and
allegations that police beat the 51-year-old Anwar highlight the
country's human rights abuses.
	   Anwar, dressed casually in a white shirt with no tie, sat in the
defendant's dock and appeared unmoved by Tuesday's testimony. He is
being held in prison, possibly for the duration of the trial.
	   Separately, Anwar's wife, Azizah Ismail, read a statement to
reporters from her husband, denying reports that he has a
controlling interest in a company whose name has surfaced during
the investigations against him.
	   Last week, the first witness, former Special Branch Chief
Mohamed Said Awang, testified that Anwar had forced police to
arrest and coerce retractions from the two.
	   Anwar was arrested Sept. 20, two weeks after he was fired by
Prime Minister Mahathir, setting off anti-government protests.
Anwar has pleaded innocent to 10 charges of corruption and illegal
sex acts.
	   Dozens of diplomats, international human rights and jurist
groups are sitting in on the trial, which is expected to last well
into next year.
	   The proceedings have created friction between Malaysia and some
of the 20 leaders who will take part in a summit of the Asia
Pacific Economic Cooperation group in Kuala Lumpur Nov. 17-18.
	   Denying the charges against him, Anwar has said they were
fabricated because Prime Minister Mahathir considered Anwar's
popularity a threat to his 17-year rule.

Serb police threaten to been up patrols after two officers slain

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Serb police threatened to beef up
their patrols in Kosovo following the slayings of two officers that
Serbs blame on ethnic Albania guerrillas.
	   Ethnic Albanians accuse Serbs of opening fire first on a group
of their men _ and of violating a U.S.-brokered cease-fire intended
to halt hostilities between Serbs and the ethnic Albanians who make
up 90 percent of Kosovo's population.
	   Violence by both sides has increased in the past week, including
at least three incidents in which police reported killing KLA
fighters who shot at them first.
	   The two policemen disappeared Friday, the same day Serb police
shot to death five ethnic Albanian guerrillas, including a
commander of two divisions.
	   Both of the slain policemen had gunshot wounds to the head,
indicating they had been killed execution-style. Serb police
spokesman Bozidar Filic said the executions showed the Kosovo
Liberation Army's utter disregard for the U.S.-sponsored
cease-fire.
	   He warned Monday that unless ```international representatives''
secure two main roads running through Malisevo by Wednesday, police
will increase their patrols and ``allow safe passage'' _ indicating
a possible new Serb action.
	   In a statement reflecting new pressure on international
diplomats to calm the situation, Belgrade allies of President
Slobodan Milosevic said Tuesday they were horrified by the
``criminal, cunning murder.''
	   The pro-communist Yugoslav Left demanded a tough international
response and pledged that state authorities will ``prevent acts of
terrorism ... and protect their citizens,'' the official Tanjug
news agency reported.
	   David Scheffer, the roving U.S. ambassador on war crimes issues,
viewed the bodies in Malisevo, a devastated central village, as he
toured the area with the Kosovo Diplomatic Observer Mission.
	   ``This represents one of the problems that is being experienced
here with the cease-fire, and that is that there are violations of
the cease-fire by both sides,'' Scheffer said.
	   Serb authorities suspect the killed policemen were kidnapped by
the KLA in retaliation for the shootings of the five guerrillas.
	   The rebels say police shot at the five as they drove in two
vehicles from Opterusa village, while police claim the guerrillas
opened fire first.
	   A KLA official said the killing of the five guerrillas violated
a de facto cease-fire in Kosovo. Under a 4-week-old agreement
between Milosevic and U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke, Milosevic's
forces were supposed to cease hostilities.
	   Dozens of Serb police were killed before and after the start of
a Serb crackdown on ethnic Albanian separatists last February in
Kosovo, a majority Albanian province. Several hundred other people,
mostly ethnic Albanians, have been killed, and as many as 300,000
driven from their homes.

West Indies team arrives in Johannesburg
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ The troubled West Indies
cricket team arrived Tuesday in South Africa for a historic tour
minus its two best fast bowlers.
	   Courtney Walsh and Curtley Ambrose missed the plane and would
leave London Tuesday night, said Ali Bacher, head of South Africa's
United Cricket Board.
	   Jimmy Adams, a star batsman, cut his finger with a bread knife
during the flight, Bacher added. His status was uncertain.
	   The team left London Monday evening after a settlement ended
their revolt over pay. Their opening match comes Wednesday in
Soweto, against a Gauteng provincial 11, and the first test begins
Nov. 26 in Johannesburg.
	   ``Good sense triumphed in the end and I am sure you are going to
see a wonderful tour,'' Bacher said.
	   The team was kept away from reporters at the airport, and were
expected to hold a news conference in the afternoon at their
Johannesburg hotel.
	   The tour is the first by the West Indies since the fall of
apartheid.

Scientists find sex hormones shape the developing and adult brain
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JANE E. ALLEN &QC;

<TEXT>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) _ Sex hormones can influence brain development
in the young, memory in the old and may explain why young men tend
to develop neurological problems like autism and dyslexia while
older women suffer from depression and anxiety, scientists say.
	   ``We are recognizing with some surprise the extent to which the
brain responds'' to sex steroids, said Douglas Meinecke of the
National Institute of Mental Health in Washington. ``These hormones
_ testosterone, progesterone and estrogen _ have profound effects
on the brain and the brain is profoundly responsive.''
	   Meinecke discussed the role of sex hormones in development and
aging Monday at the Society for Neuroscience annual meeting.
	   Researchers hope the hormones can be used to fend off the
ravages of aging and disease. Already, estrogen replacement therapy
has been observed to protect older women against Alzheimer's
disease.
	   Nancy Forger, a psychologist at the University of Massachusetts,
said she's found that sex hormones can prevent cell death.
	   Men have more motor neurons in their spinal cords that govern
muscles attached to the penis, she found. The neurons are found
both in men and women before birth; however, in the absence of male
hormones, the neurons degenerate in females.
	   Ms. Forger is trying to learn how male hormones save these cells
and understand the role of proteins that regulate growth and
survival of neurons.
	   Margaret McCarthy, a physiologist at the University of Maryland
School of Medicine, suggested that early exposure to male hormones
can create permanent brain changes.
	   Testosterone levels in rats are as high in development as
they're going to be in adulthood, she said. Giving a female rat
testosterone creates ``a male brain never to be switched back.''
	   Similarly, if testosterone-producing organs are removed from the
male rat, he ends up with a ``female brain,'' she said.
	   Only male reproductive organs produce sex hormones during
development, she said. Female sex organs, which produce estrogen,
are inactive until later.
	   ``As far as we know, it is also true for humans,'' Ms. McCarthy
said.
	   Asked about male and female brain differences, she noted that
boys suffer from more neurological disorders than girls. They're
more likely to have schizophrenia, autism and dyslexia, while girls
are more likely to suffer neurological illnesses later in life such
as major depression, anxiety disorders, panic disorders or eating
disorders.
	   ``This hormonal difference early in life may set up a situation
that more easily goes awry and explains why boys are more
susceptible at an early age,'' she said.
	   John Morrison, a neurobiology professor at Mount Sinai Medical
School in New York, said his studies of estrogen's effects on a
brain region called the hippocampus may shed light on aging.
	   He has that found the number of receptors on hippocampal cells
fluctuates, depending on how much estrogen is present.
	   ``The hippocampus mediates memory and loss of memory is one of
the key events to aging,'' he said.

Pinochet case threatens likes of Castro, says Cuban leader's
</HEADLINE>
daughter &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Fidel Castro's daughter welcomed the arrest of Gen.
Augusto Pinochet and said it will serve as a precedent that could
lead to her father being tried for human rights abuse.
	   ``I'm very aware there have been thousands of victims at the
hands of my father,'' Alina Fernandez Revuelta was quoted as saying
in an interview published Tuesday by the daily Le Parisien.
	   ``The Pinochet affair is going to create a legal precedent for
all dictators, including those who are still in power like Fidel
Castro.''
	   She added that ``justice will be done'' if ever Castro is tried.
Cuban exiles, encouraged by the Pinochet case, have filed suit in
Spain accusing Castro of genocide, terrorism and torture.
	   Fernandez Revuelta, 42, fled Cuba in 1993 with a faked Spanish
passport and wearing a wig. At the time, she declared her father a
torturer, drug smuggler and terrorist.
	   One of eight children the Cuban leader is known to have
fathered, the former fashion model has since lived in the United
States and Spain.
	   ``Castro has pushed his people to suicide,'' she was quoted as
saying.
	   ``Cuba is an island isolated by the U.S. embargo and the iron
regime which controls everything. If you write the word `freedom'
on the wall you end up in jail.''
	   Lawyers representing Cuban exiles last week submitted papers to
Spain's National Court detailing the cases of thousands of people
who allegedly have suffered torture or been killed since Castro
took power in 1959.
	   British police arrested Pinochet on Oct. 16 in his hospital bed
at the request of a Spanish magistrate seeking to extradite the
former Chilean leader for trial.
	   England's High Court ruled that he had diplomatic immunity as a
former foreign head of state. An appeal is currently underway in
Britain's highest court, the House of Lords.

SAfrican cops who bombed cinema with `Cry Freedom' get amnesty
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) _ Two policemen who bombed a
Johannesburg cinema showing the anti-apartheid film ``Cry Freedom''
were granted amnesty on Tuesday.
	   In 1988, Capt. Gert van Huysteen and Sgt. Magezi Ndaba attacked
the King's Cinema in the black Johannesburg township of Alexandra,
which was planning to screen the film, starring Denzel Washington.
No one was killed in the bombing.
	   The movie portrays the life of black consciousness leader Steve
Biko, who was killed while in police custody in 1977. His death
caused an international outcry and helped politically isolate the
apartheid regime.
	   Pardon was granted by the Amnesty Committee of the Truth and
Reconciliation Commission, a panel set up to probe apartheid era
crimes by all sides in the struggle against white rule.
	   Though the commission has completed its work and handed a final
report to President Nelson Mandela, the amnesty operation has been
extended indefinitely to cope with a heavy workload.
	   Former law and order minister Adriaan Vlok is applying for
amnesty for a series of bomb blasts at theaters showing ``Cry
Freedom,'' as well as other bomb attacks. There has been no
decision yet on Vlok.
	   In addition, the committee also amnestied four members of the
right wing Afrikaner Resistance Movement, known by its Afrikaans
initials as the AWB, for bombing a trading store and a school in
the early 1990s.
	   An African National Congress member and a black student were
also granted amnesty for charges of illegally possessing arms and
ammunition and burning down a school respectively.
	   In order to qualify for amnesty, applicants must tell the whole
truth about their crime and prove a political motive.

Takanohana, Wakanohana suffer upsets
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   FUKUOKA, Japan (AP) _ Yokozunas (grand champions) Takanohana and
Wakanohana both lost Tuesday, leaving Takanohana with just one
victory in the first three days of the 15-day Kyushu Grand Sumo
Tournament.
	   Musashimaru, or Fiamalu Penitani from Hawaii, remained
undefeated at 3-0, but fellow ozeki (champion) Takanonami suffered
his second defeat.
	   Takanohana, seeking his 21st tournament title and third in a
row, was crushed down by No. 1 maegashira (senior wrestler)
Tochiazuma, who fought off Takanohana's arm throw attempt at the
ring's edge. Both wrestlers now are 1-2.
	   Wakanohana (2-1) pushed out No. 1 maegashira Kaio, but it was
after the yokozuna's left heel had gone out of the ring as he
circled away from Kaio's initial charge.
	   The referee first called Wakanohana the winner, but the five
judges consulted and found his heel mark outside the ring.
	   It was the third straight victory for Kaio, who beat Takanonami
and Takanohana on the first two days.
	   Musashimaru charged winless No. 2 maegashira Higonoumi with hand
thrusts and crushed him down.
	   Komusubi (junior champion second class) Kotonowaka toppled
Takanonami with an arm throw, leaving both wrestlers at 1-2.
	   Sekiwake (junior champion) Chiyotaikai (3-0), seeking promotion
to ozeki, sent out winless No. 2 maegashira Kaiho with hand
thrusts.
	   No. 12 maegashira Kyokushuzan, or Mongolian Batbayar Davaa, was
thrown down by No. 9 maegashira Minatofuji for his second defeat
against one victory. Minatofuji is 2-1.
	   In the 26-member juryo division, just below the senior makuuchi
division, No. 2-ranked Kyokutenho, or Mongolian Tsevegnyam Nyamjav,
was pushed out by No. 5-ranked Zenshinyama (2-1) for his second
defeat against one victory.
	   No. 10-ranked Hoshitango, or Argentine Imach Marcelo Salomon,
suffered his second defeat against one victory, losing to No.
12-ranked Susanoumi (1-2) by an arm throw technique.
	   In makushita, the top junior division, No. 5-ranked Hoshiandesu,
or Argentine Jose Antonio Juarez, slapped down No. 4-ranked
Tamarikido for his first victory against one defeat.
	   No. 11-ranked Wakaazuma, or Yoshinobu Kuroda from Brazil, was
pulled down by No. 10-ranked Oominato for his first defeat against
one victory.
	   In sandanme, the second-highest junior division, No. 15-ranked
Ryuko, or Brazilian Luis Go Ikemori, crushed down No. 16-ranked
Komanofuji for his second victory against no defeats.
	   Wrestlers in junior divisions have only seven bouts during the
tournament.

<TEXT>
	   PRETORIA, South Africa (AP) _ A South African boxer was in
critical condition in intensive care Tuesday after collapsing
following his knockout in a lightweight bout.
	   George Mbatha underwent emergency surgery for blood on the brain
at Eugene Marais Hospital, said hospital spokeswoman Hybie de
Jager.
	   ``The next 12 to 24 hours will determine whether he will pull
through,'' she said.
	   During a tournament at the Carousel Casino Monday evening,
Mbatha was knocked out in the fifth round by an uppercut from
Kenyan Athanas Nzau. He walked out of the ring but collapsed in the
dressing room, South African Press Association reported.

Studies suggest herbal remedy eases problems of prostate
</HEADLINE>
enlargement &QL; 
 &UR; For release at 1500 GMT &QL; 
 &UR; By BRENDA C. COLEMAN &QC; 
 &UR; AP Medical Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CHICAGO (AP) _ Research suggests that an herbal remedy popular
for treating prostate problems works without the side effects of
traditional drugs, though experts cautioned that more tests are
needed.
	   Berries from the saw palmetto tree have been used to treat
symptoms caused by the enlargement of the prostate gland as far
back as the Seminole Indians in Florida in the 1700s, according to
a report in Wednesday's Journal of the American Medical
Association.
	   Saw palmetto is used far more than prescription drugs in Europe
to treat noncancerous prostate enlargement, but its chemical
mechanism is unknown.
	   In the report, doctors reviewed 18 studies of saw palmetto use
involving 2,939 patients with benign prostate enlargement, which
causes difficulty urinating in many men over 50. The trials ranged
from four to 48 weeks.
	   Men taking saw palmetto extracts were nearly twice as likely to
report improvements in symptoms than men taking placebos, said
researchers led by Dr. Timothy Wilt of the Minneapolis Veterans
Affairs Medical Center.
	   When compared with finasteride, a prostate-shrinking
prescription drug marketed in the United States as Proscar, saw
palmetto provided similar relief with fewer side effects, including
impotence, the review found.
	   But ``our results should be viewed with caution,'' the authors
said. Few studies reported their findings in standardized ways,
most were brief and they involved varying doses and combinations of
saw palmetto with other plant-based compounds.
	   None of the studies compared saw palmetto with the most commonly
used prostate drugs, a class called alpha blockers that relax
prostate muscles and are marketed in the United States as Cardura,
Flomax and Hytrin.
	   The authors called for further research, and an expert not
involved in the review agreed.
	   ``I tell my own patients that saw palmetto is harmless, that
there's a suggestion that it may improve symptoms, but we don't
really know with certainty,'' said the expert, Dr. John McConnell,
a spokesman for the American Urological Association.
	   McConnell, also chair of urology at the University of Texas
Southwestern Medical School in Dallas, advised against taking
remedies with multiple ingredients besides saw palmetto that are
now being marketed as ``prostate pills.''
	   Such preparations ``have not been evaluated at all,'' he said.

Foreign minister says U.S., British threat of force `reckless'
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS three grafs at end on atomic weapons inspectors. &QL; 
 &UR; By EILEEN ALT POWELL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraq's foreign minister said that the
American and British threat of a military strike was ``a reckless
act'' and called for a political solution to the dispute over U.N.
weapons inspections.
	   The minister, Mohammed Saeed al-Sahhaf, said in an interview
late Monday with Al-Jazeera Television that military action would
``lead to destabilizing the region.''
	   He called on the U.N. Security Council to respond to Iraq's
demand that a planned review of Iraq's compliance with U.N.
resolutions lead to the lifting of punishing sanctions, imposed
eight years ago after Iraq invaded Kuwait.
	   Al-Sahhaf said the Security Council should be ``given a genuine
opportunity _ free from all Anglo-Saxon pressures _ to conduct a
comprehensive review of the situation that is acceptable to all
parties.''
	   This, al-Sahhaf said, should ``lead us to start the process of
lifting the embargo on Iraq.''
	   ``As for those screaming and threatening the use of force, this
is nothing but a reckless act in the region,'' al-Sahhaf told the
Qatari television station.
	   In using the phrase ``Anglo-Saxon pressures,'' al-Sahhaf
referred to threats by the United States and Britain to use
military action after Iraq announced on Oct. 31 that it was halting
cooperation with the U.N. Special Commission.
	   The commission is responsible for overseeing the destruction of
Iraq's chemical and biological weapons as well as long-range
missiles.
	   UNSCOM must certify that Iraq has eliminated its weapons of mass
destruction before the Security Council will lift the sanctions,
which limit Iraq's sale of oil, its economic mainstay.
	   Iraq acted just one day after the Security Council agreed to
review the country's compliance with U.N. resolutions. But it did
not accede to Iraq's demand that this be linked to lifting the
sanctions.
	   Al-Sahhaf said ``intensive contacts'' were under way _ including
with Prakash Shah, the special envoy of U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan _ to resolve the impasse. Ireland's former prime minister,
Albert Reynolds, left Iraq on Monday after a three-day visit
pledging to lobby Britain and the United States to avoid using
force and seek a negotiated settlement.
	   ``There is no solution but the diplomatic-political solution,''
Al-Sahhaf insisted.
	   British Defense Secretary George Robertson warned during a visit
to Kuwait on Monday that the patience of the international
community was ``drifting away'' and that ``the option of force is
there, is real.''
	   U.S. President Bill Clinton met Sunday with his top security
advisers but put off a decision on whether to use force against
Iraq.
	   Meanwhile, the state-run daily Al-Qadissiya reported Tuesday
that Iraq's vice president, Taha Yassin Ramadan, told a visiting
journalist that Iraq's Oct. 31 decision is ``a logical, just and
legal right'' of the country and that Iraq would not reverse it.
	   He accused the United States of ``hollow threats'' and said
military action would only strengthen Iraq's determination to end
the embargo.
	   Also Tuesday five teams from the Vienna-headquartered
International Atomic Energy Agency went into the field, the largest
number so far this month, U.N. spokeswoman Caroline Cross said.
	   Iraq's decision on Oct. 31 to suspend cooperation with U.N.
weapons monitors exempted the IAEA, which is close to declaring
Iraq free of nuclear weapons. UNSCOM technicians have been allowed
into the field from time to time to check cameras and sensors, but
they are banned from on-site inspections.
	   UNSCOM has begun reducing staff in Baghdad because the
inspectors cannot work. Twenty inspectors already have left and
another 10 are to depart later this week, leaving about 100 at the
U.N. headquarters on the outskirts of Baghdad.

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Dampening prospects for a breakthrough on Tibet,
China accused the Dalai Lama Tuesday of insisting on independence
for his Himalayan homeland despite claims he wants to compromise.
	   The criticism from the Foreign Ministry and the ruling Communist
Party's People's Daily was the latest in a barrage of invective
China has launched to counter reports the Dalai Lama was preparing
a peace overture to Beijing while on his current trip to the United
States.
	   The Dalai Lama, the spiritual and political leader of Tibet who
fled into exile 39 years ago, was due to meet Tuesday in Washington
with U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, Vice President Al
Gore and possibly President Bill Clinton.
	   Hours before, China's Foreign Ministry warned that meetings
between the Tibetan and U.S. leaders would ``seriously hurt the
feelings of the Chinese people'' and betray U.S. support for what
it claimed was the Dalai Lama's goal of separating Tibet from
China.
	   ``The Dalai Lama has never repented for his activities in
splitting the motherland and advocating Tibetan independence,''
ministry spokesman Zhu Bangzao said at a twice-weekly briefing for
reporters.
	   Noting that Washington recognizes Beijing's rule over Tibet, Zhu
demanded that U.S. leaders not meet the Dalai Lama ``so as not to
cause damage to China-U.S. relations.''
	   ``We have always opposed foreign interference into China's
internal affairs,'' the People's Daily, the party's flagship
newspaper, said.
	   In the weeks before the Dalai Lama began his 10-day trip to the
United States, aides said he would make a conciliatory response to
Chinese President Jiang Zemin's offer in June to hold talks.
	   So far, the Dalai Lama has not met China's conditions: that he
renounce independence and recognize Tibet as an inseparable part of
China and Taiwan as a province of China. On Monday, he described
Tibetans as ``victims of human rights violations.''
	   ``The Dalai Lama has presented nothing new this time,'' the
People's Daily said. It added that the exiled leader's remarks were
designed to whip up international public opinion and proved he was
insincere about wanting talks.
	   The People's Daily accused representatives of the Dalai Lama of
``circling around the issue of Tibetan independence'' in fitful
negotiations over the past 20 years.
	   ``They have never halted their activities to split the
motherland, even when they were at the talks,'' it said.
	   People's Daily editorials are reviewed by senior officials
before publication and reflect the views of China's leadership.
	   Despite the harsh statements, ever since President Jiang's offer
in June, both the Chinese government and the Dalai Lama's
government-in-exile have insisted they have kept open contacts.
China has repeated the offer to talk.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia has reached a tentative agreement on food
aid with the European Union just days after completing a similar
deal with the United States, news reports said Tuesday.
	   Under the plan, Russia would purchase food worth 400 million
European currency units (dlrs 480 million) and receive E.U.
humanitarian aid worth 10 million to 12 million ecus (dlrs 12 to 14
million), Deputy Prime Minister Gennady Kulik said, according to
Russian news agencies.
	   The two sides will meet shortly to finalize the deal, he said.
EU officials said Monday that a deal was in the works, but have not
yet announced any agreement.
	   The food purchased by the Russian government would be sold on
the Russian domestic market with the profits spent on social
programs, Kulik said. Russia wants the humanitarian aid to be
targeted primarily toward its frigid northern regions, he said.
	   The report comes just four days after Russia and the United
States signed a dlrs 625 million agreement for 3.1 million tons of
U.S. food aid, including wheat, corn, pork and beef.
	   Russia's economic crisis, combined with drought and falling food
imports, have raised concerns about the country's food supplies
heading into the winter. No serious food shortages have been
reported, but the government wants to ensure that plenty is on
hand.
	   Meanwhile, Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov rounded up several of
his top Cabinet ministers and headed to parliament in a bid to win
broad support for his economic recovery program.
	   The session was closed, but was expected to revolve around an
anti-crisis plan that was approved by the Cabinet 10 days ago. The
major themes have been widely discussed, but the government has yet
to release all the details.
	   Russia's economic crisis hit almost three doaic steps.
	   Primakov still has wide respect among the various political
factions, but liberal critics say he's too hesitant to pursue
genuine market reforms, while Communists and other hardliners would
like to see even more government control over the economy.
	   The International Monetary Fund and other international lenders
have already expressed dissatisfaction with the plan as short on
specific measures and heavy on state controls over the economy.
	   The group has said a solid plan and proof of its implementation
are necessary for the further release of a dlrs 22.6 billion
bailout package. The loan was agreed upon last summer but frozen
when the crisis hit in August.
	   Also, First Deputy Prime Minister Yuri Maslyukov urged the Duma
to approve the long-stalled START II arms control treaty.
	   President Boris Yeltsin supports the agreement, but the
Communists and other hardliners who control parliament have blocked
its ratification for years.

Key Madrid defender Hierro out for three weeks with leg injury
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Real Madrid anchorman Fernando Hierro looks
certain to miss the team's crucial European Champions League game
against Inter Milan this month because of a calf-muscle injury,
news reports said Tuesday.
	   Hierro, 30, will be out of action for at least three weeks and
will miss two league games and the European bout, doctors said. He
is also in doubt for the Intercontinental Cup match against Vasco
de Gama in Tokyo on Dec. 1, the daily El Pais reported.
	   The Spanish international who has commanded Real's defense for
the past 10 seasons is likely to be replaced by Fernando Sanz, son
of club chairman Lorenzo Sanz.
	   Madrid lies No. 2 in the 20-team first division, a point behind
leader Mallorca. The side plays No. 3 Celta next weekend and then
Valencia before meeting Italy's Inter.

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder pledged
Tuesday during his first major policy speech to put Germans back to
work and give the nation a new optimism about the future.
	   In his inaugural address to parliament, Schroeder said he would
modernize Europe's biggest economy and promote private initiative
but also put new emphasis on a government that provides for
society's weakest members.
	   That theme, touted by some in Europe's new left as the ``Third
Way'' between pure capitalism and a strong social welfare state,
helped the younger Schroeder unseat longtime leader Helmut Kohl in
September.
	   ``People in Germany don't lack creative forces,'' Schroeder
declared. ``We will help make them unfold.''
	   He accused Kohl's government of leading the nation into
stagnation and pessimism during its 16 years in office and called
for a new push of German industriousness.
	   ``We are going turn this country into a place on the move
again,'' he said. ``The only thing we need to fear is getting stuck
in blockades of our own making.''
	   While repeating campaign promises to rescind cuts in social
programs passed by Kohl's conservative government, he warned that
the time of government largesse was over. He promised ``resolute
consolidation'' of federal spending.
	   The new chancellor went before the new parliament armed with a
15 billion mark (dlrs 8.9 billion) cut in Germany's high taxes that
he says will lower unemployment, stuck above 10 percent. Lawmakers
are to take up the legislation Friday.
	   Rejecting criticism by business, he insisted the tax plan would
lighten the burden on small and medium-size companies that hurts
German competitiveness and spur the economy by leaving more money
in the average wage earner's pocket.
	   ``Unemployment remains our most pressing and most painful
problem,'' Schroeder said.
	   With the left in power in most European countries, Schroeder
said there was a ``unique chance'' for a common fight against
unemployment. ``Our goal is a European jobs pact,'' he said.
	   Stressing a campaign promise, he said he will start talks with
industry and labor next month on ways to create jobs, reviving a
consensus model that helped turn Germany into an economic
powerhouse after World War II.
	   He pledged continued government aid to economically struggling
eastern Germany, blighted by four decades of communist rule that
ended with German unification in 1990.
	   Schroeder outlined other goals set by his Social Democrats and
their junior coalition partner, the ecology-minded Greens, for
parliament's four-year term: weaning Germany off nuclear energy,
easing citizenship rules to integrate foreigners, and streamlining
the bureaucracy. The coalition has a 21-seat majority in
parliament.
	   In relatively brief remarks on foreign policy, he said Germany
would remain a loyal U.S. ally and partner in NATO while seeking to
raise Europe's profile in international affairs.

Local election mirrors Israel's increasing fragmentation
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MARK LAVIE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Accompanied by ethnic tensions and violence,
Israelis voted for mayors and local councils Tuesday in an election
that mirrored the growing fragmentation of Israel's society.
	   Ethnic and sectarian factions seemed certain to bite deep into
the support of the two main national parties, Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu's Likud and the Labor opposition, headed by
ex-Israeli army chief of staff Ehud Barak.
	   For the first time, a party representing immigrants from the
former Soviet Union ran candidates for local councils. With 900,000
immigrants, Israelis from the old Soviet Union have become Israel's
largest ethnic bloc, overtaking Israelis of Moroccan descent.
	   In the coastal town of Ashkelon, where the two ethnic groups
live side-by-side amid growing tensions, the main campaign issue
was the killing of a Russian immigrant last week. The victim
supposedly was targeted because his attackers felt he was taunting
them in Russian.
	   Most Orthodox Jews are expected to vote for parties representing
their interests. In Jerusalem, a growing ultra-Orthodox Jewish
population exercises increasing power at the ballot box.
	   In all, 682 candidates competed for 58 mayor spots, and more
than 20,000 hopefuls ran for 2,800 seats on local councils.
	   Israeli police were deployed to counter election fraud and
control violence. As the campaign drew to a close, there were
incidents of arson and fistfights among rival party workers.
	   In Tel Aviv, a switchboard serving the offices of front-running
mayor candidate Ron Huldai was set on fire, cutting off telephones
at his headquarters. In one district, a firebomb was thrown at the
house of a candidate, and in another the car of a volunteer was
torched.
	   Many Russian immigrants are expected to vote for Israel B'Aliya,
the immigrants' party represented by former Soviet dissident Natan
Sharansky in Netanyahu's Cabinet, said Lev Melamed, editor of
``Viesty,'' the largest-circulation Russian-language daily
newspaper in Israel.
	   It's straight local politics, and Israel's sputtering
negotiations with the Palestinians are not an issue, Melamed told
The Associated Press Tuesday. ``If there is a strong representative
n the city council, he can look out for the interests of his
constituents,'' he said.
	   Experts believe turnout among secular Israelis will drop below
50 percent, but immigrants and ultra-Orthodox Jews will vote in
larger numbers, giving them proportionally more power.
	   The ultra-orthodox Agudat Israel party in Jerusalem took no
chances. Rabbis instructed their followers to vote for the party,
said activist Baruch Cohen, 22, as he organized transportation for
voters in a religious neighborhood.
	   ``Some people need more encouragement,'' he said, gesturing
toward a bank of telephones where volunteers were calling voters.
	   The spiritual leader of the ultra-Orthodox group Shas, Rabbi
Ovadia Yosef, reportedly told followers in a Sabbath lecture that
those voting for the party's candidates will go to heaven.
	   Shas activists have also distributed bottles of oil blessed by a
revered rabbi, Yitzhak Kadourie, a centenarian who during the
campaign was helicoptered from town to town.

Sri Lankan army appeals to ``patriotic youths'' to become commandos
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) _ The defense ministry is urging young
men to join the Sri Lankan army, saying its war against Tamil Tiger
separatists had entered a decisive stage and it was in need of
heroes.
	   ``All patriotic youths of this country are hereby invited to
come forward as heroes of the land to engage in this national
endeavor ...,'' the ministry said in an advertisement appearing
Tuesday in the state-run newspaper the Daily News.
	   Fourteen recruitment centers will open island-wide for three
weeks beginning Nov. 18 to take applications from unmarried males
between the ages of 18 and 24.
	   The 100,000-personnel Sri Lanka army is besieged by desertions
and general lack of enthusiasm among able-bodied men to serve in
the battlefield. The army, which has been fighting Tamil Tiger
separatists since 1983, estimates the number of deserters at
between 8,000 to 12,000.
	   Three amnesties were declared this year under which deserters
could return without risking punishment. An estimated 10,000
responded, but other soldiers continued to desert.
	   The government launched its last nationwide campaign to bring
back deserters after heavy battles in September left at least 1,800
soldiers and rebels dead or missing.
	   Tamil rebels are fighting for a homeland in the country's north
and east, claiming that they are discriminated against by the
majority Sinhalese who control the government and the military. The
government denies the charge.
	   More than 55,000 people have died in 15 years of fighting.

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Despite a massive security clampdown
across the capital, protests and street clashes among rock-throwing
mobs Tuesday marred the opening of a government assembly convened
to carve out a new political future for crisis-ridden Indonesia.
	   The People's Consultative Assembly met at the national
Parliament, protected from the violence by razor wire barricades
and thousands of armed troops.
	   In several areas, pro- and anti-government activists threw rocks
and brawled before being broken up by soldiers.
	   Much of Tuesday's trouble involved teen-age boys, armed with
knives and bamboo spears. As many as 120,000 have been recruited by
pro-government activists as private security guards to protect the
assembly from student protests.
	   Hundreds of them confronted 5,000 anti-government students
protesters on a busy road near the University of Indonesia.
	   Outside the legislature, rival groups also clashed briefly.
Troops blocked off a toll road and dispersed the crowd with sticks
but made no arrests.
	   In East Jakarta, hundreds of the pro-government guards threw
rocks and fought with local residents. Witnesses said several
people were injured.
	   About 30,000 troops and police have been deployed across Jakarta
to safeguard the assembly meeting.
	   Critics doubt that the 1,000-member assembly, Indonesia's
highest legislative body, will deliver on promises to dismantle the
32-year-old authoritarian legacy of former President Suharto, who
quit in May after a wave of deadly riots and protests.
	   However, Parliament Speaker Harmoko, once a dogmatic and loyal
Suharto supporter, warned that anarchy could engulf the world's
fourth most populous nation unless fundamental political changes
were made to meet the reform demands of 202 million Indonesians.
	   The assembly is meeting for four days as Indonesia grapples with
its worst economic crisis in decades.
	   Inflation and unemployment are soaring, and millions of people
are sinking into poverty. Rioting and looting have occurred
sporadically for months in many areas.
	   The assembly's main job is to set a date sometime in late May
for parliamentary elections and to help frame new laws to legalize
free political parties.
	   ``We regard the general election as the best way for the people
to determine their own future in a democratic manner,'' Harmoko
said.
	   Harmoko said the assembly, made up of 475 legislators and 625
government appointees, would revoke old decrees that preserved
special presidential powers during the Suharto era. It would also
promote human rights and clean government.
	   In a sign of compromise, military chief Gen. Wiranto has said
that the armed forces are willing to discuss demands to limit their
prominent role in politics, which now gives them a guaranteed 75
seats in the 500-member Parliament.
	   One proposal is to cut its representation down to 55 seats.
	   Despite promises of change, opponents claim most of the
assembly's members are holdovers from the Suharto era.
	   With Indonesia's main opposition figures not part of the
assembly, critics fear it will try to bolster the position of
current President B.J. Habibie.
	   Habibie, a longtime friend and former loyal aide of Suharto,
plans to stand as a presidential candidate next year.
	   Habibie was applauded warmly when he attended Tuesday's opening
session. But he did not speak so as to avoid giving the impression
that he was trying to sway the delegates.
	   In a show of discontent, Indonesia's three main opposition
figures held a closed-door meeting in south Jakarta.
	   At a rally earlier Tuesday, hundreds of students called on the
assembly to disband. They also demanded that Habibie quit and that
the military get out of politics altogether.
	   They also called for Suharto to be tried for corruption.

Foreign minister says U.S., British threat of force is reckless
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS three grafs at end on atomic weapons inspectors. &QL; 
 &UR; By EILEEN ALT POWELL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraq's foreign minister said the American
and British threat of a military strike was reckless and called for
a political solution to the dispute over U.N. weapons inspections.
	   The minister, Mohammed Saeed al-Sahhaf, said in an interview
late Monday with Al-Jazeera Television that military action would
destabilize the region.
	   He called on the U.N. Security Council to respond to Iraq's
demand that a planned review of Iraq's compliance with U.N.
resolutions lead to the lifting of punishing sanctions, imposed
eight years ago after Iraq invaded Kuwait.
	   Al-Sahhaf said the Security Council should be ``given a genuine
opportunity _ free from all Anglo-Saxon pressures _ to conduct a
comprehensive review of the situation that is acceptable to all
parties.''
	   This, al-Sahhaf said, should ``lead us to start the process of
lifting the embargo on Iraq.''
	   ``As for those screaming and threatening the use of force, this
is nothing but a reckless act in the region,'' al-Sahhaf told the
Qatari television station.
	   In using the phrase ``Anglo-Saxon pressures,'' al-Sahhaf
referred to threats by the United States and Britain to use
military action after Iraq announced on Oct. 31 that it was halting
cooperation with the U.N. Special Commission.
	   The commission is responsible for overseeing the destruction of
Iraq's chemical and biological weapons as well as long-range
missiles.
	   UNSCOM must certify that Iraq has eliminated its weapons of mass
destruction before the Security Council will lift the sanctions,
which limit Iraq's sale of oil, its economic mainstay.
	   Iraq acted just one day after the Security Council agreed to
review the country's compliance with U.N. resolutions. But it did
not accede to Iraq's demand that this be linked to lifting the
sanctions.
	   Al-Sahhaf said ``intensive contacts'' were under way _ including
with Prakash Shah, the special envoy of U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan _ to resolve the impasse. Ireland's former prime minister,
Albert Reynolds, left Iraq on Monday after a three-day visit
pledging to lobby Britain and the United States to avoid using
force and seek a negotiated settlement.
	   ``There is no solution but the diplomatic-political solution,''
Al-Sahhaf insisted.
	   British Defense Secretary George Robertson warned during a visit
to Kuwait on Monday that the patience of the international
community was ``drifting away'' and that ``the option of force is
there, is real.''
	   U.S. President Bill Clinton met Sunday with his top security
advisers but put off a decision on whether to use force against
Iraq.
	   Meanwhile, the state-run daily Al-Qadissiya reported Tuesday
that Iraq's vice president, Taha Yassin Ramadan, told a visiting
journalist that Iraq's Oct. 31 decision is ``a logical, just and
legal right'' of the country and that Iraq would not reverse it.
	   He accused the United States of ``hollow threats'' and said
military action would only strengthen Iraq's determination to end
the embargo.
	   Also Tuesday five teams from the Vienna-headquartered
International Atomic Energy Agency went into the field, the largest
number so far this month, U.N. spokeswoman Caroline Cross said.
	   Iraq's decision on Oct. 31 to suspend cooperation with U.N.
weapons monitors exempted the IAEA, which is close to declaring
Iraq free of nuclear weapons. UNSCOM technicians have been allowed
into the field from time to time to check cameras and sensors, but
they are banned from on-site inspections.
	   UNSCOM has begun reducing staff in Baghdad because the
inspectors cannot work. Twenty inspectors already have left and
another 10 are to depart later this week, leaving about 100 at the
U.N. headquarters on the outskirts of Baghdad.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Serb police threatened to beef up
their patrols in Kosovo following the slayings of two officers that
Serbs blame on ethnic Albania guerrillas.
	   Ethnic Albanians accuse Serbs of opening fire first on a group
of their men _ and of violating a U.S.-brokered cease-fire intended
to halt hostilities between Serbs and the ethnic Albanians who make
up 90 percent of Kosovo's population.
	   Violence by both sides has increased in the past week, including
at least three incidents in which police reported killing KLA
fighters who shot at them first.
	   The two policemen disappeared Friday, the same day Serb police
shot to death five ethnic Albanian guerrillas, including a
commander of two divisions.
	   Both of the slain policemen had gunshot wounds to the head,
indicating they had been killed execution-style. Serb police
spokesman Bozidar Filic said the executions showed the Kosovo
Liberation Army's disregard for the U.S.-sponsored cease-fire.
	   He warned Monday that unless ```international representatives''
secure two main roads running through Malisevo by Wednesday, police
will increase their patrols and ``allow safe passage'' _ indicating
a possible new Serb action.
	   In a statement reflecting new pressure on international
diplomats to calm the situation, Belgrade allies of President
Slobodan Milosevic said Tuesday they were horrified by the
``criminal, cunning murder.''
	   The pro-communist Yugoslav Left demanded a tough international
response and pledged that state authorities will ``prevent acts of
terrorism ... and protect their citizens,'' the official Tanjug
news agency reported.
	   David Scheffer, the roving U.S. ambassador on war crimes issues,
viewed the bodies in Malisevo, a devastated central village, as he
toured the area with the Kosovo Diplomatic Observer Mission.
	   ``This represents one of the problems that is being experienced
here with the cease-fire, and that is that there are violations of
the cease-fire by both sides,'' Scheffer said.
	   Serb authorities suspect the killed policemen were kidnapped by
the KLA in retaliation for the shootings of the five guerrillas.
	   The rebels say police shot at the five as they drove in two
vehicles from Opterusa village, while police claim the guerrillas
opened fire first.
	   A KLA official said the killing of the five guerrillas violated
a de facto cease-fire in Kosovo. Under a 4-week-old agreement
between Milosevic and U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke, Milosevic's
forces were supposed to cease hostilities.
	   Dozens of Serb police were killed before and after the start of
a Serb crackdown on ethnic Albanian separatists last February in
Kosovo, a majority Albanian province. Several hundred other people,
mostly ethnic Albanians, have been killed, and as many as 300,000
driven from their homes.

Helicopter crash seriously injures two air force officers

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ A newly repaired helicopter crashed
Tuesday, seriously injured the two army officers aboard, an army
aviation control officer said.
	   The helicopter crashed in Lopburi province, 115 kilometers (71
miles) north of Bangkok, about an hour after taking off for an
engine test, said the officer, speaking on condition of anonymity.
	   The helicopter was usually used for training, he told The
Associated Press.
	   The injured men were taken to a provincial hospital, where they
were in critical condition, he said.
	   A safety team from the Army Aviation Office in Lopburi went to
the crash site to investigate the cause of the accident, he added.

Kurdish women go on hunger strike
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   YEREVAN, Armenia (AP) _ Seven female members of a Kurdish group
were on a three-day hunger strike Tuesday in support of a
controversial Kurdish leader, whom they claim is being persecuted.
	   The women, who began their protest Monday at the Freedom for the
Women of Kurdistan building in the Armenian capital, were dancing,
singing and watching Kurdish television on Tuesday.
	   The walls in the room were adorned with portraits of Abdullah
Ocalan, who leads the banned Kurdistan Workers Party, or PKK. The
group has been fighting for Kurdish autonomy in Turkey since 1984.
	   ``Fighting against imperialism, fascism and the colonial policy
of Turkey, we are approaching the victory in the cause of
liberation of our people,'' the women said in a statement.
	   Kurds elsewhere were also demonstrating in support of Ocalan,
said the PKK leader in Armenia Mraz Khumoyan. Ocalan has been
labeled a terrorist by Turkey and the United States.
	   Turkish leaders say Ocalan is currently hiding in Russia, but
Russian officials have refused to confirm that he is in the
country.
	   Last week, Russia's parliament passed an appeal asking President
Boris Yeltsin to offer political asylum to Ocalan. Officials say
Yeltsin is unlikely to heed parliament's appeal.

Take two aspirin and grow me in the morning

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ Dutch farmers whose slow-growing
cucumbers have been causing them headaches have found a solution _
aspirin. For the cucumbers, that is.
	   Scientists with the respected Dutch research institute TNO have
discovered that feeding aspirin to young cucumber plants helps
prevent thickening of the root walls.
	   Plants with thick root walls absorb water and minerals less
easily than those with thin root walls, leading to slower growth.
	   ``Aspirin doesn't remove the cause of the thickening, but it
reduces the level of damage,'' plant physiologist Sjoukje
Heimovaara told the Algemeen Dagblad newspaper for Tuesday's
edition.
	   Aspirin contains an acid also made naturally by plants to
protect themselves. No trace of the aspirin was found in the
cucumbers themselves.
	   Researchers are now planning to extend their experiment to
eggplants, tomatoes and peppers.

Spain jobless rate rises to 11.11 P.C. in October
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Spain's jobless claims rose to 11.11
percent of the active population in October from 11.02 percent the
previous month, the Labor Ministry said Tuesday.
	   At the end of October, about 1.8 million people had filed for
unemployment insurance, up 15,277 from September, the ministry
said.
	   Analysts tend to watch the National Statistics Institute's
quarterly unemployment data more closely than the Labor Ministry's
monthly jobless-claims data. In the second quarter of 1998, the
figure was at 18.9 percent.
	   The quarterly data includes information on people out of work,
rather than just on those eligible for unemployment benefit
payments.

Four years into food shortages, North Koreans weak, sickly
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photo BEJ103 &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ North Korea is entering its fourth winter of
chronic food shortages with its people malnourished and at risk of
dying from normally curable illnesses, senior Red Cross officials
said Tuesday.
	   The officials warned against international complacency and
hostility toward North Korea as the food crisis stretches on and
the isolated communist country shows little willingness to adopt
far-reaching changes to revive its ruined economy.
	   ``Humanitarian suffering cannot be routine in any part of the
world,'' said Margareta Wahlstrom, the Red Cross' undersecretary of
disaster relief, who returned to Beijing Tuesday after a week
inspecting the aid agency's operations in North Korea.
	   She and other Red Cross officials saw further ravages of North
Korea's slow-motion famine: electricity supplied to only half the
capital, Pyongyang, at a time; the elderly looking swollen, a sign
of long-term hunger; a generation of children stunted, with
10-year-olds looking like 6-year-olds and 5-year-olds like
2-year-olds.
	   Everywhere, from bakeries to government ministries, people were
being served noodles and cakes made from soybeans mixed with
acorns, grass and herbs, Red Cross president Astrid Heiberg said.
	   Heiberg likened the additives to ``cattle food'' and noted that
doctors reported a rise in stomach illnesses from the mixtures.
	   ``This is really part of the daily life,'' she said. ``You would
not give them to your children or your elderly mother knowing she
would get cramps in her stomach and diarrhea unless her stomach was
moaning.''
	   Three years of floods and drought that started in 1995
devastated North Korea's collective farming and planned economy,
already teetering from the loss of its Soviet bloc trading
partners.
	   With few goods or money to barter or buy foreign supplies, the
country lacks sufficient fertilizer for crops, and fuel and parts
for machinery.
	   The Red Cross inspectors saw soldiers and people harvesting
cabbage, the winter's main vegetable. The grain harvest is finished
and by U.N. estimates little improved over last year's: about 3
million tons, only enough to meet two-thirds of the needs of North
Korea's 22 million people.
	   As the long, harsh winter begins, doctors confirm and official
statistics show widespread malnutrition, tuberculosis on the rise
and hunger-weakened patients unable to recover from operations and
sickness, Heiberg said.
	   Doctors worry that the respiratory illnesses so common in the
winter may ``take a toll'' on the weakened population, she said.
	   One 10-bed hospital in the countryside was keeping only three
patients at a time because it did not have food to care for more,
said Heiberg.
	   The Red Cross wants to focus its latest dlrs 9 million appeal on
getting essential medicines and blankets and warm clothes to North
Korea. Food aid is largely being turned over to U.N. agencies.

Government ready to give up stake in Philippine Airlines
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with PAL announcing resumption of flights to Tokyo and
Hong Kong, 13th graf; adds size of government stake, 3rd graf &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ The Philippine government is ready to
give up its stake in ailing Philippine Airlines and will not infuse
any additional capital if a new investor, possibly Cathay Pacific
Airways, comes in, officials said Tuesday.
	   ``Our objective is full privatization. The government's policy
is to be out of the company that is being privatized,'' Finance
Secretary Edgardo Espiritu said.
	   The government owns 14 percent of PAL, mostly held by public
financial institutions, pension funds and the defense forces.
	   PAL is negotiating with Cathay Pacific, which could buy up to 40
percent of the airline under Philippine law.
	   Cathay Pacific has said it wants management control of the
Philippine flag carrier, which has been mired in debt and labor
unrest. A PAL official has said it is willing to give Cathay
Pacific management control.
	   Several Manila newspapers reported Tuesday that Cathay Pacific
also is demanding that the government divest its shareholdings in
PAL before it will agree to conclude a deal with the airline.
	   PAL executive vice president Manolo Aquino said there was no
such demand, adding that the government's shares in PAL will
naturally be diluted once a deal is forged and Cathay Pacific puts
in new capital.
	   President Joseph Estrada said he would agree to any setup in PAL
as long as it remains the country's flag carrier.
	   ``As long as PAL continues and as long as it remains the flag
carrier of the country, so be it,'' he said.
	   PAL, Asia's oldest airline, has been unable to make payments on
dlrs 2.1 billion in debt after being devastated by a pilots' strike
and by Asia's currency crisis.
	   PAL shut down its operations on Sept. 23 after the ground crew
union turned down a management-proposed recovery plan that included
a 10-year suspension of labor's collective bargaining agreement in
exchange for 20 percent ownership of the airline.
	   Workers agreed to accept the plan nearly two weeks after the
shutdown, and the airline resumed domestic flights Oct. 7 and
international flights to the United States on Oct. 26.
	   PAL is to resume flights to Hong Kong and Tokyo on Wednesday. It
plans to restart flights to Singapore, Taipei, Fukuoka and Osaka in
the next few weeks.

China arrests more than 140 underground Christians
</HEADLINE>

`Officials in ... ' &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Chinese police have arrested more than 140
members of underground Protestant churches and beat their leaders
in what a church campaigner warned is a new crackdown on worship
outside state control.
	   The worshipers were arrested at meetings in underground, or
house churches _ so-called because they often use private homes _
on Oct. 26 and Nov. 5 in two separate places in central Henan
province, according to a letter from a church campaigner.
	   After jailing the worshipers, police ``cruelly beat'' at least
13 identified as leaders, and their fate was unknown, said the
letter dated Monday and released Tuesday by the New York-based
Human Rights in China.
	   ``These two acts of religious persecution are not isolated. Even
greater religious persecution will unfold over the next two
months,'' said the letter, written by David Zhang, a self-styled
spokesman for China's house churches.
	   A police official in Wugang County _ site of 40 of the arrests
on Oct. 26 _ said police moved to shut down an illegal meeting and
began hauling people away only when they resisted. Some even shot
at the officers with homemade rifles, said the official, who gave
only his surname, Wang.
	   Officials in Nanyang city, where the other arrests were made,
refused to comment, as did China's Religious Affairs Bureau, which
oversees religious policies.
	   Although Chinese leaders have shown a willingness to discuss
religious tolerance with U.S. President Bill Clinton, U.N. human
rights chief Mary Robinson and other Western dignitaries, police
intimidation of house churches persists.
	   China forbids worship outside of institutions approved by the
state _ in the case of Protestants, the China Christian Council.
	   But as two decades of free market reforms discredited communist
ideology and loosened the Communist Party's hold over people's
lives, the number of religious believers has soared.
	   Although the China Christian Council claims worshipers number 11
million, estimates by missionaries and members of the unofficial
church run as high as 80 million.
	   While many Chinese Protestants and state-ordained ministers
worship in both legal and house churches, the underground church
movement tends to be more evangelical.
	   The meetings in Henan attracted followers from all over China,
said the letter released by Human Rights in China. In Wugang,
police arrested people from 16 provinces, said county police
official Wang.
	   According to the letter, police surrounded the gathering at
night on Oct. 26 in Liuwan village outside Wugang city and then
suddenly attacked, taking away Han Rongqin, Cheng Meiying and nine
other leaders of the house church movement.
	   On Nov. 5, 100 kilometers (60 miles) to the northeast, police in
Nanyang city broke up a house church service and arrested leaders
Lu Lianquan and Zhang Fushan along with more than 100 worshipers,
said the letter.
	   Despite the persecution, ``we believe the Chinese government
will one day realize that Christianity is a stabilizing effect on
Chinese society, that the faith of China's house churches is pure
and its believers are patriotic,'' the letter said.

EU opens formal enlargement talks amid anxiety about Cyprus,
</HEADLINE>
expansion pace
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with comments after EU-Cyprus session
 &UR; By ROBERT WIELAARD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ Cyprus urged the European Union Tuesday
to push Turkey into helping end the division of the Mediterranean
island and refrain from obstructing the EU membership drive of the
Greek Cypriots.
	   Opening formal membership talks with the EU, Cypriot Foreign
Minister Ioannis Kasoulides stressed his government's commitment to
the ``search of a viable and just solution.'' Reunification of the
island communities would also lead to a ``substantial improvement''
in Greek-Turkish relations, he said.
	   On Monday, the Dutch, German and French governments issued a
declaration questioning the wisdom of admitting Cyprus unless the
Mediterranean island is first reunified.
	   Kasoulides said the three should have addressed themselves to
Turkey which has been criticized for hampering United Nations
efforts to reunify Greek and Turkish Cypriots.
	   The three EU members said the division of Cyprus weighed on the
island's membership chances.
	   Turkey invaded the northern one-third of Cyprus in 1974,
installed a government it only recognizes and still maintains
30,000 troops there.
	   ``I wish to reiterate once again that the government of Cyprus,
despite the absence of positive developments and the hardening of
the Turkish position, ... devotes all its powers and exerts all its
efforts in search of a viable and just solution,'' Kasoulides told
the EU foreign ministers.
	   Sources said there was a fear in the EU of importing
Greek-Turkish rivalry by admitting Cyprus and that once inside the
EU Greek Cypriots _ the only government the international community
recognizes on the island _ may hamper reunification and keep
Turkish Cypriots out of the union.
	   Austrian Foreign Minister Wolfgang Schuessel downplayed the
statement of the Dutch, German and French governments saying it
remained the formal EU view that Cyprus remained a valid candidate
and that membership talks can encourage U.N. reconciliation efforts
on the island.
	   On Tuesday, the EU also began membership talks with five East
European nations amid anxiety about the speed of its expansion
drive.
	   After meeting with Kasoulides, the EU foreign ministers met in
one-on-one sessions with their colleagues from Poland, Hungary, the
Czech Republic, Slovenia and Estonia.
	   These countries are in the lead after preliminary expansion
talks that began in March. The EU is not yet beginning formal
membership talks with five other candidates: Lithuania, Latvia,
Slovakia, Romania and Bulgaria.
	   On Monday, the leaders of Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia, at a
meeting in Oslo, complained the EU moved so slowly it could
destabilize the Baltic region.
	   The EU has set no date for its eastward expansion. But the most
successful candidates may well join as early as 2004.
	   Lithuanian Prime Minister Gediminas Vagnorious warned of
``unnecessary tensions'' that could complicate relations with
Russia and other neighbors unless the EU accelerated its screening
of candidates.
	   Formal membership negotiations with Cyprus and five East
European nations open several days after the European Commission,
in a fist-thick assessment report declared the expansion drive
``broadly on track.''
	   Although there was room for improvement here and there, it said
all 11 candidates were pursuing economic and political reforms to
get in shape for EU membership.
	   The Commission said Latvia, Lithuania and Slovakia do so well
they may be advanced to the group of fast-track candidates as of
1999.
	   At a regular foreign ministers meeting Monday, the EU broadly
endorsed the commission's findings. Yet French Foreign Minister
Hubert Vedrine cautioned against advancing countries from the
slower group saying that could widen the gap for Romania and
Bulgaria which face the toughest task in meeting membership
criteria.

<TEXT>
	   PRETORIA, South Africa (AP) _ A South African boxer was
recovering in intensive care Tuesday after collapsing following his
knockout in a lightweight bout.
	   George Mbatha underwent emergency surgery for blood on the brain
at Eugene Marais Hospital, said hospital spokeswoman Hybie de
Jager.
	   ``He's OK. He's out of danger,'' said Heim Klopper, a spokesman
for the Carousel Casino, where the amateur bout took place Monday
evening.
	   During a tournament at the casino, Mbatha was knocked out in the
fifth round of the six-round bout by an uppercut from Kenyan
Athanas Nzau. He walked out of the ring but collapsed in the
dressing room, Klopper said.

Most Asian stock markets close sharply lower
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Most Asian stock markets slumped Tuesday, with
the key index in Bangkok tumbling more than 7 percent on
profit-taking.
	   Dealers said the Thai market is undergoing consolidation after
the index soared 14 percent last week. The Stock Exchange of
Thailand index fell 27.23 points, or 7.5 percent, closing at
336.62.
	   In Seoul, the main index tumbled 5 percent after the U.S. dollar
rose to its highest level against the Japanese currency in a month.
	   A weaker yen causes South Korean manufacturers to lose their
price competitiveness against their Japanese rivals because they
vie directly in such key industries as automobiles and
semiconductors.
	   The Korea Composite Stock Price Index fell 21.21 points to
403.24.
	   The dollar was quoted at 122.32 yen in late afternoon, up 2.96
yen from late Monday in Tokyo and also above its late New York
level of 121.57 yen overnight. The dollar ranged between 121.42 yen
and 122.70 yen, its highest level since Oct. 8.
	   The dollar rose on buying by Japanese trust banks and
institutional investors as fears of U.S. financial instability
receded, traders said.
	   Philippine shares also closed sharply lower as investors
continued to take profits on the back of a weak peso and Wall
Street's overnight fall.
	   The 30-share Philippine Stock Exchange Index fell 75.41 points,
or 4.4 percent, to 1,637.10 after Monday's 84.86-point fall.
	   In currency trading, the dollar averaged 40.492 pesos on the
Philippine Dealing System, up 64.7 centavos or 1.6 percent, from
Monday's close.
	   Tokyo's benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average fell 86.45
points, or 0.61 percent, closing at 14,108.09. On Monday, the index
had gained 72.57 points, or 0.51 percent.
	   Share prices rose in the morning on buying of export-oriented
issues, encouraged by the yen's weakening trend against the dollar.
	   But the market fell in the afternoon in thin trading, with many
players holding back before the government draws up economic
stimulus measures on Nov. 16.
	   Elsewhere:
	   SINGAPORE: Shares closed sharply lower as profit-taking eroded
the main index's heavy gains of the past month. The Straits Times
Index fell 47.22 points, or 3.9 percent, to 1,219.28.
	   TAIPEI: Share prices slumped after the chairman of the Henyang
Group, Ho Hsi-fong, admitted that he bounced checks, although he
said the financial difficulties were his personal problems and that
all units of the group are operating normally. The key Weighted
Stock Price Index fell 145.10 points, or 2.1 percent, to 6,812.30.
	   HONG KONG: Share prices closed lower on continued profit-taking.
The blue-chip Hang Seng Index fell 130.60 points, or 1.3 percent,
closing at 9,721.33.
	   WELLINGTON: New Zealand share prices closed lower, dragged down
by overnight falls on Wall Street. The benchmark NZSE-40 Capital
Index fell 21.32 points, or 1.1 percent, to 2,007.41.
	   SYDNEY: Australian share prices closed lower after
resource-related stocks took a tumble in response to lower base
metals prices on the London Metal Exchange Monday. The All
Ordinaries Index fell 6.7 points, or 0.2 percent, to 2,682.4.
	   KUALA LUMPUR: Malaysian share prices closed mixed. The benchmark
Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange Composite Index rose 1.85 points to
467.54.
	   JAKARTA: Indonesian share prices closed sharply lower on
escalating domestic political tension coupled with profit-taking.
The Composite Index fell 7.089 points, or 1.9 percent, to 357.304.

Singapore, Hong Kong exchanges stay at odds over futures contract
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ The Singapore International Monetary Exchange
issued a thinly veiled criticism of the Hong Kong Stock Exchange on
Tuesday, warning that exchanges that fear competition will
ultimately lose business.
	   ``Exchanges that adopt an enlightened approach to competition
find that there is a bigger pie to share,'' SIMEX president Ang
Swee Tian said at an international futures industry seminar.
	   But exchanges that pursue anti-competitive practices invariably
find they are powerless to prevent business migrating elsewhere,
Ang warned.
	   Hong Kong's stock exchange has said it will block real-time
price data from being used by Singapore's monetary exchange for
futures trading of a stock index that is virtually identical to the
special administrative region's benchmark index.
	   Singapore's monetary exchange plans to launch the Morgan Stanley
Capital International Hong Kong Stock Index Futures contract Nov.
23.
	   Officials from the Hong Kong exchange have argued that the SIMEX
product might steal away trading business, and could be used by
outside parties to manipulate the Hang Seng Index.
	   Also speaking at the Tuesday seminar, Hong Kong Stock Exchange
chief Alex Tsui said he questioned the value of another exchange
using ``information to offer a certain product that competes with
my product that I trade on my exchange.''
	   Tsui added that Hong Kong's agreements with information vendors
state that if information is supplied to a third party to create a
competitive product, then the exchange has to give its consent.
	   ``So far no one has come to ask any consent whatsoever,'' Tsui
said. ``I'm still waiting for any proposal from anybody saying that
it is good for both parties; I haven't seen any so far.''
	   Executives from the feuding exchanges met in Hong Kong last
week, but made no progress in resolving the dispute.
	   On Tuesday, Ang denied allegations that by relaunching the
contract _ which was originally listed in Singapore in 1993 but
scrapped last year because of lack of interest _ SIMEX was trying
to win business away from Hong Kong.
	   He said SIMEX seeks to maintain close working relationships with
other exchanges to promote collective market integrity.

Human rights group says Iraq executed 125 detainees
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Iraq has executed 125 political prisoners
arrested during and after a failed uprising in southern Iraq
following the 1991 Gulf War, a human rights group said Tuesday.
	   The executions, which included those of three Egyptians, took
place in the infamous Abu Ghraib prison west of Baghdad in early
October, said a statement from the London-based Center for Human
Rights of the Iraqi Communist Party.
	   The group listed the names of the executed prisoners which
included 29 military men, some in the elite Republican Guards and
the Iraqi air force.
	   The others, it said, are mostly from the southern Shiite Muslim
towns or Kurds from the north. Southern Shiites and Kurds staged an
unsuccessful uprising against President Saddam Hussein's regime
after the Gulf war.
	   In a statement faxed to The Associated Press in Cairo, the human
rights group listed the names of two colonels, one lieutenant
colonel and a major in the Republican Guards. It gave the names of
13 Iraqi air force officers with ranks up to lieutenant colonel.
	   The group said the three Egyptians, Isam Awadallah Hamdi,
Mubarak Rushdi Makawi, both from Assiut, and Fathi Abdel-Saheb
Matlab of Cairo, were executed for ``supplying information to an
enemy country.''
	   There was no way to independently confirm the report. There have
been repeated reports of executions and widespread arrests by
Saddam's regime to silence its opponents.
	   In April, the U.N. human rights commissioner responsible for
Iraq, former Dutch Foreign Minister Max van der Stoel, said as many
as 1,500 people may have been executed in Iraqi prisons and
elsewhere last year.
	   ``The new massacre is another chain in a series of executions
and mass killings which the ruling regime started since last autumn
in what it termed the campaign for cleansing the prisons,'' the
group's statement said.
	   Iraq's former labor minister, Abdel-Aziz Mohammed Saleh
al-Sayegh, in the first public admission of prison overcrowding,
told a Baghdad newspaper in March that Iraqi prisons hold five
times their capacity of inmates. Al-Sayegh was fired by Saddam on
May 11 with no reason given.
	   The London-based group also said another Egyptian, Hamed Marai
Abdel-Aziz, is waiting a similar fate in cell number 31 in the
prison.
	   Prison authorities have handed the bodies of only three
high-ranking officers to their families for burial, while the rest
were buried by the Abu Ghraib municipality in a mass grave on
October 8 near the dairy factory in the area, the statement said.

EU opens formal enlargement talks amid anxiety about Cyprus,
</HEADLINE>
expansion pace
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with comments after EU-Cyprus session
 &UR; By ROBERT WIELAARD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ Cyprus urged the European Union Tuesday
to push Turkey into helping end the division of the Mediterranean
island and not obstruct the EU membership drive of the Greek
Cypriots.
	   Opening formal membership talks with the EU, Cypriot Foreign
Minister Ioannis Kasoulides stressed his government's commitment to
the ``search of a viable and just solution.'' Reunification of the
island communities would also lead to a ``substantial improvement''
in Greek-Turkish relations, he said.
	   On Monday, the Dutch, German and French governments issued a
declaration questioning the wisdom of admitting Cyprus unless the
Mediterranean island is first reunified.
	   Kasoulides said the three should have addressed themselves to
Turkey which has been criticized for hampering United Nations
efforts to reunify Greek and Turkish Cypriots.
	   The three EU members said the division of Cyprus weighed on the
island's membership chances.
	   Turkey invaded the northern one-third of Cyprus in 1974 and
installed a government, backed by 30,000 troops.The government is
only recognized by Turkey.
	   ``I wish to reiterate once again that the government of Cyprus,
despite the absence of positive developments and the hardening of
the Turkish position, ... devotes all its powers and exerts all its
efforts in search of a viable and just solution,'' Kasoulides told
the EU foreign ministers.
	   Sources said there was a fear in the EU of importing
Greek-Turkish rivalry by admitting Cyprus and that once inside the
EU Greek Cypriots _ the only government the international community
recognizes on the island _ may hamper reunification and keep
Turkish Cypriots out of the union.
	   Austrian Foreign Minister Wolfgang Schuessel downplayed the
statement of the Dutch, German and French governments saying it
remained the formal EU view that Cyprus remained a valid candidate
and that membership talks can encourage U.N. reconciliation efforts
on the island.
	   On Tuesday, the EU also began membership talks with five East
European nations amid anxiety about the speed of its expansion
drive.
	   After meeting with Kasoulides, the EU foreign ministers met in
one-on-one sessions with their colleagues from Poland, Hungary, the
Czech Republic, Slovenia and Estonia.
	   These countries are in the lead after preliminary expansion
talks that began in March. The EU is not yet beginning formal
membership talks with five other candidates: Lithuania, Latvia,
Slovakia, Romania and Bulgaria.
	   On Monday, the leaders of Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia, at a
meeting in Oslo, complained the EU moved so slowly it could
destabilize the Baltic region.
	   The EU has set no date for its eastward expansion. But the most
successful candidates may well join as early as 2004.
	   Lithuanian Prime Minister Gediminas Vagnorious warned of
``unnecessary tensions'' that could complicate relations with
Russia and other neighbors unless the EU accelerated its screening
of candidates.
	   Formal membership negotiations with Cyprus and five East
European nations open several days after the European Commission,
in a fist-thick assessment report declared the expansion drive
``broadly on track.''
	   Although there was room for improvement, it said all 11
candidates were pursuing economic and political reforms to get in
shape for EU membership.
	   The Commission said Latvia, Lithuania and Slovakia do so well
they may be advanced to the group of fast-track candidates as of
1999.
	   At a regular foreign ministers meeting Monday, the EU broadly
endorsed the commission's findings. Yet French Foreign Minister
Hubert Vedrine cautioned against advancing countries from the
slower group saying that could widen the gap for Romania and
Bulgaria which face the toughest task in meeting membership
criteria.

Nissan posts lost for first half of year on shrinking stock values
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Nissan Motor Co., Japan's second-largest automaker,
said Tuesday it suffered a net loss of 32.6 billion yen (dlrs 267
million) for the six months ended in September, reflecting a sharp
fall in the value of its investment in domestic stocks.
	   Despite savings from streamlining efforts, the company was
unable to meet a forecast that it would break even. Nissan had
reported a 38.5 billion yen (dlrs 315 million) net profit for
April-September in the previous year.
	   Over the summer, a plunge in Japanese stock prices to the lowest
levels in more than a decade eroded the company's asset cushion.
The drop forced Nissan to swallow 76 billion yen (dlrs 621 million)
in valuation losses on its securities holdings, it said.
	   That easily offset the 30 billion yen (dlrs 245 million) derived
from cost-cutting measures and an additional 17 billion yen (dlrs
139 million) in currency-related gains, the automaker said.
	   Nissan also suffered from a deepening slump in demand for
vehicles in its recession-hit home market. Sales over the
sixth-month period declined 7.7 percent from a year earlier to 1.64
trillion yen (dlrs 13.4 billion).
	   For the full fiscal year ending next March, Nissan reversed an
earlier forecast that it would break even. It said Tuesday that it
now expects a 10 billion yen (dlrs 82 million) net loss for the
year.
	   It reported a net profit of 16.6 billion yen (dlrs 136 million)
for the last fiscal year.
	   Sales for the full year will fall an estimated 4.1 percent to
3.4 trillion yen (dlrs 27.8 billion), it predicted.
	   Unlike other Japanese automakers, Nissan has been unable to ride
out the domestic slump by counting on strong sales overseas.
	   At the group level, the parent company and its subsidiaries
expect to report a 30 billion yen (dlrs 245 million) net loss for
the fiscal year on a 1.5 percent decline in sales to 6.4 trillion
yen (dlrs 52.3 billion).
	   The company says it will limit losses at its troubled North
American units to 5 billion yen (dlrs 41 million) this year, an
improvement over the 80 billion yen (dlrs 654 million) net loss
reported last year.

Prince Philip's visit to Dublin foreshadows likely visit by queen
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DUBLIN, Ireland (AP) _ Britain's Prince Philip made his first
official trip Tuesday to the Irish Republic, an event observers say
will set the stage for a state visit by his wife, Queen Elizabeth
II.
	   No British monarch has visited the territory of the Republic of
Ireland since 1913.
	   The prince traveled to Dublin Castle, former seat of British
rule before the predominantly Catholic south of Ireland won
independence in 1922, alongside Irish President Mary McAleese.
	   The prince, also known as the duke of Edinburgh, planned to meet
Irish Prime Minister Bertie Ahern and other cabinet ministers
during his brief stay, the first first by a British royal since the
prince's eldest son, Prince Charles, came here in 1995.
	   Tuesday's visit provided the latest expression of increasingly
good relations between Britain and Ireland, whose governments
worked closely together to promote April's compromise accord in
British-ruled Northern Ireland, where competing British and Irish
nationalities have fueled bloodshed for 30 years.
	   The last time a reigning British monarch visited Ireland was
when George V stayed at what was then the Vice Regal Lodge in
Dublin's vast Phoenix Park. Today it is the official residence of
McAleese, Ireland's elected and largely symbolic head of state,
where the prince's Royal Air Force helicopter landed.
	   McAleese and the British queen are scheduled to appear together
Wednesday in Belgium to commemorate the millions slain on the
Western Front in World War I, when thousands of Irishmen _ from
north and south, Protestant and Catholic alike _ fought and died as
British soldiers.
	   Irish officials think the most likely timing for a visit to
Ireland by the queen would be in the year 2000, after all the key
provisions of the Northern Ireland agreement are in place.

Squash legend elected vice president of world federation
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Pakistani squash legend Jahangir Khan has been
elected a vice president of the World Squash Federation.
	   Khan, 34, arguably the world's greatest ever squash player, was
elected to the post at the federation's annual assembly in
Stuttgart, Germany, the WSG announced Tuesday.
	   New Zealand's Susie Simcock was re-elected as WSG president,
along with vice presidents Anne Smith of Canada and England's Mike
Corby.
	   Khan succeeds Hassan Musa, who was shot dead a year ago in
Karachi, thus maintaining Pakistan's role in the WSF management.
	   ``Jahangir will be a tremendous asset to world squash in this
new role with the WSF and we are delighted to welcome him to the
board,'' Simcock said, adding that Khan will work with Corby in
pushing squash's bid to become an Olympic sport.
	   Khan came to prominence in 1979 when, as an unseeded
15-year-old, he won the World Amateur Championship in Australia.
Undefeated in the sport for 5 1/2-years until November 1986, he
went on to win a record 10 British Open championships and six World
Open titles.
	   Khan, who lives in Karachi, is sports general manager for
Pakistan International Airlines and a vice president of the
Pakistan Squash Federation.
	   During the WSF assembly, Guatemala and Venezuela were admitted
as new members, bringing the membership to 115 countries, and Egypt
was selected as host of the 1999 men's World Team Championships.

	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Rescuers feared that 14 workers
trapped in a collapsed tunnel were dead, the official Antara news
agency reported Tuesday.
	   Antara said 47 workers were initially trapped in Monday's
accident at a dam construction site in Tanggamus district on the
southern end of Sumatra Island, about 230 kilometers (140 miles)
northwest of Jakarta.
	   It said 33 were rescued and have been hospitalized, some in
serious condition.
	   Rescue efforts continued Tuesday as hopes faded for those still
trapped.
	   Antara said the tunnel's roof caved in when framework holding it
in place collapsed after a steel cable broke.
	   It quoted witnesses at the site as saying the workers had been
about 80 meters (262 feet) below the surface when the accident
happened.

Belgrade police impound all copies of Dnevni Telegraf
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Police impounded all 100,000 copies
of Tuesday's edition of an independent Belgrade daily newspaper for
allegedly breaching Serbia's restrictive media law.
	   Despite the crackdown, the owner of Dnevni Telegraf vowed to
keep publishing.
	   The police action at the paper's downtown headquarters late
Monday came after the daily failed to pay a fine of 1.2 million
dinars (dlrs 120,000) to the state.
	   A Belgrade district court ruled Sunday that Dnevni Telegraf
(Daily Telegraf) chiefs would have to pay the steep amount for
``publishing information inciting destruction of the constitutional
order.''
	   The move against the newspaper, known for its criticism of
President Slobodan Milosevic's autocratic regime, is the latest in
a series of crackdowns against Serbia's fledgling independent media
following the adoption of a restrictive media law last month.
	   Dnevni Telegraf owner and chief editor Slavko Curuvija said he

Local election mirrors Israel's increasing fragmentation

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Accompanied by ethnic tensions and violence,
Israelis voted for mayors and local councils Tuesday in an election
that mirrored the growing fragmentation of Israel's society.
	   Ethnic and sectarian factions seemed certain to bite deep into
the support of the two main national parties, Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu's Likud and the Labor opposition, headed by
ex-Israeli army chief of staff Ehud Barak.
	   For the first time, a party representing immigrants from the
former Soviet Union ran candidates for local councils. With 900,000
immigrants, Israelis from the old Soviet Union have become Israel's
largest ethnic bloc, overtaking Israelis of Moroccan descent.
	   In the coastal town of Ashkelon, where the two ethnic groups
live side-by-side amid growing tensions, the main campaign issue
was the killing of a Russian immigrant last week.
	   The victim supposedly was targeted because his attackers thought
he was taunting them in Russian.
	   Most Orthodox Jews are expected to vote for parties representing
their interests. In Jerusalem, a growing ultra-Orthodox Jewish
population exercises increasing power at the ballot box.
	   In all, 682 candidates competed for all 58 mayor spots, and more
than 20,000 hopefuls ran for all 2,800 seats on local councils.
	   Israeli police were deployed to counter election fraud and
control violence. As the campaign drew to a close, there were
incidents of arson and fistfights among rival party workers.
	   In Tel Aviv, a switchboard serving the offices of front-running
mayor candidate Ron Huldai was set on fire, cutting off telephones
at his headquarters. In one district, a firebomb was thrown at the
house of a candidate, and in another the car of a volunteer was
torched.
	   Many Russian immigrants are expected to vote for Israel B'Aliya,
the immigrants' party represented by former Soviet dissident Natan
Sharansky in Netanyahu's Cabinet, said Lev Melamed, editor of
``Viesty,'' the largest-circulation Russian-language daily
newspaper in Israel.
	   It's straight local politics, and Israel's sputtering
negotiations with the Palestinians are not an issue, Melamed told
The Associated Press Tuesday. ``If there is a strong representative
n the city council, he can look out for the interests of his
constituents,'' he said.
	   Experts believe turnout among secular Israelis will drop below
50 percent, but immigrants and ultra-Orthodox Jews will vote in
larger numbers, giving them proportionally more power.
	   The ultra-orthodox Agudat Israel party in Jerusalem took no
chances. Rabbis instructed their followers to vote for the party,
said activist Baruch Cohen, 22, as he organized transportation for
voters in a religious neighborhood.
	   ``Some people need more encouragement,'' he said, gesturing
toward a bank of telephones where volunteers were calling voters.
	   The spiritual leader of the ultra-Orthodox group Shas, Rabbi
Ovadia Yosef, reportedly told followers in a Sabbath lecture that
those voting for the party's candidates will go to heaven.
	   Shas activists have also distributed bottles of oil blessed by a
revered rabbi, Yitzhak Kadourie, a centenarian who during the
campaign was helicoptered from town to town.
	   Polls opened 0500 GMT and will close at 2000 GMT. Results are
expected soon after.

Korea's parliament to start hearing on financial crisis
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By SANG-HUN CHOE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ South Korea's parliament will open a
potentially divisive investigation next month into alleged
mishandling of the country's economic crisis.
	   President Kim Dae-jung, who leads the ruling coalition, met with
Lee Hoi-chang, head of the main opposition Grand National Party,
Tuesday and agreed to start the hearing in the single-chamber
National Assembly on Dec. 8.
	   South Korea plunged into financial turmoil late last year while
the current opposition party was in power. President Kim, who won
election in December, has vowed to punish state economic planners.
	   The hearing was expected to trigger a heated debate on whether
policy failures should be subject to criminal punishment and
whether former President Kim Young-sam should be called to testify.
	   Two top economic advisers to the ex-president are already on
trial on charges of mishandling the crisis.
	   Prosecutors indicted former Finance Minister Kang Kyong-shik and
former Presidential Economic Secretary Kim In-ho in June, accusing
them of lying to the ex-president about the severity of the
nation's financial problems. The trial began in July.
	   The two denied the charges of negligence, arguing they kept Kim
Young-sam properly informed. Calling themselves victims of
political persecution, they vowed to defend themselves in the
parliamentary hearing, which will be televised nationwide.
	   They were both fired two days before South Korea was forced to
accept a dlrs 58 billion bailout fund from the International
Monetary Fund in December.
	   Thousands of South Korean companies have collapsed since then,
driving more than 1.5 million people out of their jobs.
	   While the new government blames the crisis on policy failures of
its predecessor, the opposition says many other factors were at
play, including an earlier meltdown of Southeast Asian economies.
	   It also argues that President Kim's then opposition party helped
precipitate the crisis by blocking key financial reform bills in
the National Assembly.
	   Those bills were adopted this year after the IMF came to South
Korea's rescue.

West Indies team arrives in Johannesburg
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with quotes from WIndies team manager, more quotes
from Bacher, background on significance of visit; no pickup &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ The troubled West Indies
cricket team arrived Tuesday in South Africa for a historic tour
minus its two best fast bowlers.
	   Courtney Walsh and Curtley Ambrose missed the plane and would
leave London Tuesday night, said Ali Bacher, head of South Africa's
United Cricket Board.
	   Jimmy Adams, a star batsman, cut his finger with a bread knife
during the flight, Bacher added. His status was uncertain.
	   The team left London Monday evening after a settlement ended
their revolt over pay. Their opening match comes Wednesday in
Soweto, against a Gauteng provincial 11, and the first test begins
Nov. 26 in Johannesburg.
	   ``It wasn't easy yesterday,'' Bacher said. ``At the end of the
day, the board acknowledged and realized the importance of the
tour, and the players acknowledged and realized the importance of
the tour,'' he said.
	   ``Good sense triumphed in the end and I am sure you are going to
see a wonderful tour.''
	   The team was kept away from reporters at the airport, and were
expected to hold a news conference in the afternoon at their
Johannesburg hotel.
	   The tour is the first by the West Indies since the fall of
apartheid in South Africa, where cricket is followed mainly by
whites. The presence of the black Caribbean team is a boost to
efforts to promote the sport among South African black youths, who
mostly follow soccer.
	   Problems started when captain Brian Lara and vice captain Carl
Hooper refused to go to South Africa, demanding better pay and
conditions. They were suspended, but reinstated as part of the
settlement.
	   West Indies tour manager Clive Lloyd, at the airport, described
the dispute as a ``little lull in their careers.
	   ``But they are professional people and know what's expected of
them,'' he said.

Russian workers in Siberia continue underground strike
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russian workers digging a railway tunnel in
Siberia continued a week-long strike to protest unpaid back wages
by staying underground, a news agency said on Tuesday.
	   Some 200 protesters have refused to come to the surface until
they start receiving wages they haven't been paid in months, the
ITAR-Tass news agency reported.
	   The workers, building a 15-kilometer (9-mile) tunnel on the
Baikal-Amur Railway, also asked the Russian Prosecutor General's
Office to investigate the economic activities of the company in
charge of the tunnel construction.
	   The tunnel is located near Lake Baikal in the small town of
Severomuisk, about 4,400 kilometers (2,700 miles) southeast of
Moscow.
	   Some of the strikers have become weak because of continuous
exposure to fumes present in the tunnel as well as hunger, local
officials said. But no one has been hospitalized so far, according
to ITAR-Tass.
	   Meanwhile, teachers at 25 schools in Russia's northwest
Leningrad region have not returned to work after their autumn
breaks because they have not received their wages for three months,
ITAR-Tass said.
	   The overall debt to the teachers in the region, located around
Russia's second largest city of St. Petersburg, totals 60 million
rubles (dlrs 3.75 million), according to ITAR-Tass.
	   Millions of Russians nationwide have gone without pay for months
as the cash-strapped government has systematically failed on its
debts.

Human rights group says Iraq executed 125 detainees
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With UN-Iraq &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Iraq has executed 125 political prisoners
arrested during and after a failed uprising in southern Iraq
following the 1991 Gulf War, a human rights group said Tuesday.
	   The executions, which included those of three Egyptians, took
place in the infamous Abu Ghraib prison west of Baghdad in early
October, the London-based Center for Human Rights of the Iraqi
Communist Party said in a statement.
	   The group listed the names of the executed prisoners, which
included 29 military men, some in the elite Republican Guards and
the Iraqi air force.
	   The others, it said, are mostly from the southern Shiite Muslim
towns or Kurds from the north. Southern Shiites and Kurds staged an
unsuccessful uprising against President Saddam Hussein's regime
after the Gulf war.
	   In a statement faxed to The Associated Press in Cairo, the human
rights group listed the names of two colonels, one lieutenant
colonel and a major in the Republican Guards. It gave the names of
13 Iraqi air force officers with ranks up to lieutenant colonel.
	   The group said the three Egyptians were executed for ``supplying
information to an enemy country.''
	   There was no way to independently confirm the report. There have
been repeated reports of executions and widespread arrests by
Saddam's regime to silence its opponents.
	   In April, the U.N. human rights commissioner responsible for
Iraq, former Dutch Foreign Minister Max van der Stoel, said as many
as 1,500 people may have been executed in Iraqi prisons and
elsewhere last year.
	   ``The new massacre is another chain in a series of executions
and mass killings which the ruling regime started since last autumn
in what it termed the campaign for cleansing the prisons,'' the
group said Tuesday.
	   Labor minister, Abdel-Aziz Mohammed Saleh al-Sayegh, in the
first public admission of prison overcrowding, told a Baghdad
newspaper in March that Iraqi prisons hold five times their
capacity of inmates. Al-Sayegh was fired by Saddam on May 11 with
no reason given.
	   The London-based group also said another Egyptian, Hamed Marai
Abdel-Aziz, is waiting a similar fate in cell number 31 in the
prison.
	   Prison authorities have handed the bodies of only three
high-ranking officers to their families for burial, while the rest
were buried by the Abu Ghraib municipality in a mass grave on
October 8 near a dairy factory, the statement said.

Britain says it is willing to help Tamil rebels, government talk

<TEXT>
	   COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) _ A British Cabinet minister said
Tuesday his government was willing to help end the civil war in its
former colony, Sri Lanka, but had been approached by neither the
government nor the Tamil Tiger rebels.
	   ``If asked by the parties involved, we are willing'' to mediate,
Derek Fatchett, minister of state for foreign and commonwealth
affairs, said at a news conference. ``But I believe you should not
go to a party uninvited. Currently there is no invitation on the
table.''
	   Fatchett met with Sri Lankan Foreign Minister Lakshman
Kadiragamer earlier Tuesday and later was to call on President
Chandrika Kumaratunga and leader of the opposition Ranil
Wickremasinghe. Fatchett was in Sri Lanka to open a 50-company
British trade fair.
	   His visit comes amid reports that the Sri Lankan government was
looking for an opening to resume peace talks with the Liberation
Tigers of Tamil Eelam, who also appear to be searching for a way
out after 15 years of military conflict that has left over 55,000
people dead.
	   Before President Kumaratunga commits herself to talks with the
LTTE, she will have to obtain the full support of the main
opposition United National Party. Without opposition support, her
administration will be unable to offer concessions to the rebels.
Her governing People's Alliance Party has only a one-seat majority
in the 225-member Parliament.
	   The last peace talks between the government and the Liberation
Tigers of Tamil Eelam broke off in April 1995 when the rebels
staged surprise attacks.
	   The rebels demand a separate homeland, accusing the Sinhalese of
oppressing the Tamils. Tamils make up 18 percent of Sri Lanka's
18.5 million people and have a language, religion and culture
distinct from that of the Sinhalese.
	   Though not all Tamils embrace the rebels' extreme solution, many
feel they are denied opportunity by the Sinhalese, who dominate the
government and military, key areas for advancement in an economy
just emerging from socialist-style policies.

Lebanese premier accuses Israel of stalling on peace deal
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Hariri on
Tuesday accused Israel of stalling in implementing a
land-for-security deal with the Palestinians.
	   Hariri made the comment after a one-hour meeting with President
Hosni Mubarak on the Mideast peace process. The Egyptian leader did
not speak to reporters, but he has recently expressed doubts Israel
would implement the American-mediated Wye accord.
	   ``It is obvious the Israeli government is stalling,'' Hariri
told reporters, referring to the accord calling for Israel to
withdraw from a further 13 percent of the West Bank in exchange for
stepped up Palestinian security against attacks on Israelis.
	   He said that Egypt was ``cautiously'' waiting for implementation
of the agreement and that Lebanon hoped the United States would
help put accord into effect.
	   The Oct. 23 Palestinian-Israeli pact has already fallen a week
behind schedule. Arab states have blamed Israel for the delay, But
Israel said it was waiting for Palestinians to outlaw armed wings
of Islamic groups.
	   After a suicide bombing in a Jerusalem market on Friday,
Israel's Cabinet suspended indefinitely debate over the agreement
until the Palestinians do more to fight Islamic militant groups.
	   Hariri also praised Egyptian-Lebanese economic relations and
said a trade agreement signed in October is expected to further
boost trade.
	   He later flew back to Lebanon at the end of a four-day visit to
Egypt.

EU opens formal enlargement talks amid anxiety about Cyprus,

 &UR; RETRANSMITTING &QL;

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with comments after EU-Cyprus session
 &UR; By ROBERT WIELAARD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ Cyprus urged the European Union Tuesday
to push Turkey into helping end the division of the Mediterranean
island and refrain from obstructing the EU membership drive of the
Greek Cypriots.
	   Opening formal membership talks with the EU, Cypriot Foreign
Minister Ioannis Kasoulides stressed his government's commitment to
the ``search of a viable and just solution.'' Reunification of the
island communities would also lead to a ``substantial improvement''
in Greek-Turkish relations, he said.
	   On Monday, the Dutch, German and French governments issued a
declaration questioning the wisdom of admitting Cyprus unless the
Mediterranean island is first reunified.
	   Kasoulides said the three should have addressed themselves to
Turkey which has been criticized for hampering United Nations
efforts to reunify Greek and Turkish Cypriots.
	   The three EU members said the division of Cyprus weighed on the
island's membership chances.
	   Turkey invaded the northern one-third of Cyprus in 1974,
installed a government it only recognizes and still maintains
30,000 troops there.
	   ``I wish to reiterate once again that the government of Cyprus,
despite the absence of positive developments and the hardening of
the Turkish position, ... devotes all its powers and exerts all its
efforts in search of a viable and just solution,'' Kasoulides told
the EU foreign ministers.
	   Sources said there was a fear in the EU of importing
Greek-Turkish rivalry by admitting Cyprus and that once inside the
EU Greek Cypriots _ the only government the international community
recognizes on the island _ may hamper reunification and keep
Turkish Cypriots out of the union.
	   Austrian Foreign Minister Wolfgang Schuessel downplayed the
statement of the Dutch, German and French governments saying it
remained the formal EU view that Cyprus remained a valid candidate
and that membership talks can encourage U.N. reconciliation efforts
on the island.
	   On Tuesday, the EU also began membership talks with five East
European nations amid anxiety about the speed of its expansion
drive.
	   After meeting with Kasoulides, the EU foreign ministers met in
one-on-one sessions with their colleagues from Poland, Hungary, the
Czech Republic, Slovenia and Estonia.
	   These countries are in the lead after preliminary expansion
talks that began in March. The EU is not yet beginning formal
membership talks with five other candidates: Lithuania, Latvia,
Slovakia, Romania and Bulgaria.
	   On Monday, the leaders of Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia, at a
meeting in Oslo, complained the EU moved so slowly it could
destabilize the Baltic region.
	   The EU has set no date for its eastward expansion. But the most
successful candidates may well join as early as 2004.
	   Lithuanian Prime Minister Gediminas Vagnorious warned of
``unnecessary tensions'' that could complicate relations with
Russia and other neighbors unless the EU accelerated its screening
of candidates.
	   Formal membership negotiations with Cyprus and five East
European nations open several days after the European Commission,
in a fist-thick assessment report declared the expansion drive
``broadly on track.''
	   Although there was room for improvement here and there, it said
all 11 candidates were pursuing economic and political reforms to
get in shape for EU membership.
	   The Commission said Latvia, Lithuania and Slovakia do so well
they may be advanced to the group of fast-track candidates as of
1999.
	   At a regular foreign ministers meeting Monday, the EU broadly
endorsed the commission's findings. Yet French Foreign Minister
Hubert Vedrine cautioned against advancing countries from the
slower group saying that could widen the gap for Romania and
Bulgaria which face the toughest task in meeting membership
criteria.

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Activists opposed to a Pacific Rim
summit's emphasis on trade descended on Malaysia Tuesday, opening
an alternative conference critical of the government leaders'
agenda.
	   The Asia-Pacific People's Summit brings together 700 activists,
from labor unions to social change pressure groups, from 25
countries.
	   They are hoping their message will be heard by leaders attending
next week's 21-nation summit meeting of the Asia-Pacific Economic
Cooperation group. Both conferences are being held in the Malaysian
capital, Kuala Lumpur.
	   ``APEC is an event where leaders push for globalization,
attacking the very roots of livelihood, not respecting fundamental
human rights,'' said Irene Fernandez, a Malaysian human rights
activist.
	   ``That's what we're resisting,'' she said at the opening session
of the ``anti-APEC'' conference that lasts until Sunday.
	   Participants plan to discuss human rights, the environment,
poverty and other issues they say are being overlooked in the rush
toward globalization.
	   ``We are calling on the APEC leaders to say that human rights
are a part of the economic process, part of the APEC process, and
it cannot be excluded,'' said Tim Parritt of London-based Amnesty
International.
	   The worrisome economic outlook in Asia and other parts of the
world will dominate the Nov. 17-18 APEC summit. Preparatory
meetings among officials and ministers begin Thursday.
	   With trade barriers dropping and new markets opening, some of
those paying the price are laborers in sweatshops and indigenous
peoples displaced from their land, a People's Summit statement
said.
	   The alternative summit will highlight the worsening social
effects of the Asian economic slump, which has forced millions into
unemployment and poverty.
	   ``You cannot divorce economic rights from political and civil
rights,'' said Param Cumaraswamy, a U.N. delegate in charge of
observing various legal and social issues in Malaysia.
	   A ceremony on the opening day commemorated the 50th anniversary
of the United Nations' Universal Declaration of Human Rights.
	   Speeches and workshops will be held throughout the five-day
summit, which will conclude with an anti-APEC demonstration.
Malaysian police have warned they would not allow such a protest.
	   Recent political events in Malaysia threatened to add further
fuel to the human rights issue. Malaysia, the APEC host country,
came under worldwide criticism after the Sept. 20 arrest of former
deputy prime minister Anwar Ibrahim. He later appeared in court
with a black eye he said came from police beatings.
	   Shaken by months of anti-government street protests, police have
called in 5,700 personnel to assure the safety of leaders attending
the APEC forum.
	   Anwar's ouster sparked the unprecedented anti-government rallies
in Kuala Lumpur. His trial on corruption and sexual misconduct
charges began Nov. 2 and will pause Nov. 14, shortly before the
world leaders arrive in Kuala Lumpur. He has pleaded innocent to
all charges.
	   APEC groups Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, China, Hong Kong,
Indonesia, Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Papua
New Guinea, the Philippines, Singapore, Taiwan, Thailand and the
United States. Russia, Vietnam and Peru will join this year.

Take two aspirin and grow me in the morning

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ Dutch farmers whose slow-growing
cucumbers have been causing them headaches have found a solution _
aspirin. For the cucumbers, that is.
	   Scientists with the respected Dutch research institute TNO have
discovered that feeding aspirin to young cucumber plants helps
prevent thickening of the root walls.
	   Plants with thick root walls absorb water and minerals less
easily than those with thin root walls, leading to slower growth.
It was not immediately known how the aspirin is administered to the
plants.
	   ``Aspirin doesn't remove the cause of the thickening, but it
reduces the level of damage,'' plant physiologist Sjoukje
Heimovaara told the Algemeen Dagblad newspaper for Tuesday's
edition.
	   Aspirin contains an acid also made naturally by plants to
protect themselves. No trace of the aspirin was found in the
cucumbers themselves.
	   Researchers are now planning to extend their experiment to
eggplants, tomatoes and peppers.

Bangladeshi laborer drowns trying to retrieve $5

	   DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) _ A Bangladeshi man drowned
when he jumped into a well to retrieve 20 dirhams (dlrs 5) that
accidentally fell into the water, the Gulf News reported Tuesday.
	   It said Abdul Ahad drowned Monday in a well in the emirate of
Fujairah, one of the seven that make up the United Arab Emirates.
	   A fellow national, Saleem Abdul Hai, went in to the well to
rescue Ahad but was too late, the paper said. ``I found him dead. I
could not get out of the well myself because I had injured
myself,'' it quoted Abdul Hai as saying.
	   The woman who owned the property where the well is located
called authorities to rescue the two men. Abdul Hai was taken to a
hospital, the paper said, without giving other details.
	   More than three quarters of the Emirates' population of 2.4
million are foreigners. Many are poor laborers from the Indian
subcontinent.

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder pledged
Tuesday during his first major policy speech to put Germans back to
work and give the nation a new optimism about the future.
	   In his inaugural address to parliament, Schroeder said he would
modernize Europe's biggest economy and promote private initiative
but also put new emphasis on a government that provides for
society's weakest members.
	   That theme, touted by some in Europe's new left as the ``Third
Way'' between pure capitalism and a strong social welfare state,
helped the younger Schroeder unseat longtime leader Helmut Kohl in
September.
	   ``People in Germany don't lack creative forces,'' Schroeder
declared. ``We will help make them unfold.''
	   He accused Kohl's government of leading the nation into
stagnation and pessimism during its 16 years in office and called
for a new push of German industriousness.
	   ``We are going turn this country into a place on the move
again,'' he said. ``The only thing we need to fear is getting stuck
in blockades of our own making.''
	   While repeating campaign promises to rescind cuts in social
programs passed by Kohl's conservative government, he warned that
the time of government largesse was over. He promised ``resolute
consolidation'' of federal spending.
	   But he called for fresh discussion about lowering European
interest rates to boost the economy, a debate that has raised
concerns about the independence of Germany's central bank and the
European Central Bank taking over on Jan. 1.
	   Schroeder went before the new parliament armed with a 15 billion
mark (dlrs 8.9 billion) cut in Germany's high taxes that he says
will lower unemployment, stuck above 10 percent. Lawmakers are to
take up the legislation Friday.
	   The Christian Democrats, now the main opposition, attacked
Schroeder's speech as a revival of old-style left ideas. Wolfgang
Schaeuble, the party's parliamentary leader, called it
disappointing and short on detail in a combative reply.
	   ``Show time is over,'' he shouted. ``What's needed now is
substance.''
	   He attacked Schroeder's call for lower interest rates, charging
the new government favors ``an easy money policy'' that will lead
to higher inflation, Schaeuble said.
	   Schroeder rejected criticism of his tax plan by business,
insisting it would lighten the burden on small and medium-size
companies that hurts German competitiveness and spur the economy by
leaving more money in the average wage earner's pocket.

Malaysia insists APEC address currency controls
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By RANJAN ROY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Malaysia will focus on regulating
foreign currency speculators when it plays host to a Pacific Rim
trade summit next week, the country's trade minister said Tuesday.
	   ``The bottom-line view is that there must be an international
resolution to this problem through putting into place some
framework,'' International Trade and Industry Minister Rafidah Aziz
told reporters as she opened the media center for the Asia-Pacific
Economic Cooperation summit.
	   Senior officials from the 21-member group begin meeting
Thursday. Leaders of the Pacific Rim countries, including newcomers
Russia, Peru and Vietnam, will meet next Tuesday and Wednesday.
	   Malaysia stunned the financial world in September when it
imposed sweeping capital controls to curb flows of speculative
money and peg the Malaysian currency at 3.80 ringgit to the dollar.
	   Malaysia has long held that the Asian currency and stock market
turmoil was brought about by speculative attacks by currency
traders and in no way reflected weaknesses of the battered
economies.
	   But many Western nations, including the United States, say weak
economic fundamentals play a role and curbs on currency speculation
hurt the free-market system.
	   On Tuesday, Rafidah said such economies would now be more
receptive because they, too, were beginning to feel the impact of
the crisis that has spread beyond Asia.
	   America's trade deficit, for example, just hit an all-time high
of dlrs 16.8 billion as the global financial crisis pushed down
exports for a fifth straight month.
	   ``Nobody calls it an East Asian crisis any more,'' said Rafidah.
	   She said Malaysia would not put forward any concrete proposals.
Officials would bring speculation controls up during discussions
later this week.
	   Rafidah also said Japan shouldn't be pressured into signing on
to a fast-track trade liberalization package, as Tokyo's refusal
wouldn't prevent the region's markets from opening further.
	   APEC's aim is free trade among the developed member nations by
2010 and developing countries by 2020.
	   Members already have agreed to fast-track progress toward free
trade in chemicals, energy, fishing, forestry products, gems and
jewelry, medical equipment and instruments, telecommunications and
toys.
	   But Japan has balked at opening up its forestry and fisheries
industries, the sectors it sees as most vulnerable to foreign
competition.
	   Rafidah stressed that the free-trade program pushed by the
United States and Australia, known as the early voluntary sector
liberalization plan, is not compulsory.
	   Despite Japan's tough stand, Rafidah said the EVSL program
should still be considered a success.
	   ``People should realize that we moved from nothing at all, from
talking and talking, to identifying sectors and getting some work
done,'' Rafidah said. ``That is a very big step forward.''
	   APEC comprises Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, China, Hong
Kong, Indonesia, Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand,
Papua New Guinea, the Philippines, Singapore, Taiwan, Thailand and
the United States. Russia, Peru and Vietnam will join at this
summit.
	   Malaysia is host to the sixth annual summit at a time of
political turmoil, with Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad's sacked
deputy on trial on 10 counts of corruption and illegal sex acts.
	   Anwar Ibrahim's case attracted worldwide attention to human
rights issues in Malaysia when the 51-year-old politician showed up
at his arraignment Sept. 29 with a black eye he said came from a
punch by police.
	   Some of the leaders attending the summit have openly expressed
sympathy for Anwar. Others, including U.S. President Bill Clinton
and Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien, have declined to meet
privately with Mahathir.
	   Rafidah hoped the visiting leaders would be courteous enough not
to ask Mahathir about the Anwar case.
	   ``I can't imagine us going to Washington and somebody asking
President Clinton, `How is Monica?''' she said.

Opposition urges Czech foreign minister to quit following leak
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) _ Leading opposition politicians
called Tuesday for Foreign Minister Jan Kavan to resign after
leaking information about the alleged visit of an Islamic
terrorist.
	   The opposition said the leak was illegal and may jeopardize
secret service plans to catch such an alleged criminal, whose
identity and motives in the Czech Republic remain unclear.
	   ``I would expect him to hand in his resignation,'' said Jan
Zahradil, a legislator for the opposition Civic Democratic Party.
	   Kavan, a member of the ruling Social Democratic Party, told the
CTK news agency he believed he didn't break the law against
disclosing secret information because it came from an unofficial

Bangladeshi laborer drowns trying to retrieve equivalent of dlrs 5
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) _ A Bangladeshi man drowned
when he jumped into a well to retrieve 20 dirhams (dlrs 5) that
accidentally fell into the water, the Gulf News reported Tuesday.
	   It said Abdul Ahad drowned Monday in a well in the emirate of
Fujairah, one of the seven that make up the United Arab Emirates.
	   A fellow national, Saleem Abdul Hai, went in to the well to
rescue Ahad but got there too late, the paper said. ``I found him
dead. I could not get out of the well myself because I had injured
myself,'' it quoted Abdul Hai as saying.
	   The woman who owned the property where the well is located
called authorities to rescue the two men. Abdul Hai was taken to a
hospital, the paper said, without giving other details.
	   More than three quarters of the Emirates' population of 2.4
million are foreigners. Many are poor laborers from the Indian
subcontinent.

Opposition urges Czech foreign minister to quit following leak
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) _ Leading opposition politicians
called Tuesday for Foreign Minister Jan Kavan to resign after
leaking information about the alleged visit of an Islamic
terrorist.
	   The opposition said the leak was illegal and may jeopardize
secret service plans to catch such an alleged criminal, whose
identity and motives in the Czech Republic remain unclear.
	   ``I would expect him to hand in his resignation,'' said Jan
Zahradil, a legislator for the opposition Civic Democratic Party.
	   Kavan, a member of the ruling Social Democratic Party, told the
CTK news agency he believed he didn't break the law against
disclosing secret information because it came from an unofficial
source.
	   He also said Monday that he was speaking off the record to
journalists when he met with them informally last week, and didn't
expect his comments to be published.

Belgrade police impound all copies of Dnevni Telegraf
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Police impounded all 100,000 copies
of Tuesday's edition of an independent Belgrade daily newspaper for
allegedly breaching Serbia's restrictive media law.
	   Despite the crackdown, the owner of Dnevni Telegraf vowed to
keep publishing.
	   The police action at the paper's downtown headquarters late
Monday came after the daily failed to pay a fine of 1.2 million
dinars (dlrs 120,000) to the state.
	   A Belgrade district court ruled Sunday that Dnevni Telegraf
(Daily Telegraf) chiefs would have to pay the steep amount for
``publishing information inciting destruction of the constitutional
order.''
	   The move against the newspaper, known for its criticism of
President Slobodan Milosevic's autocratic regime, is the latest in
a series of crackdowns against Serbia's fledgling independent media
following the adoption of a restrictive media law last month.
	   Dnevni Telegraf owner and chief editor Slavko Curuvija said he
would continue printing his newspaper in Bulgaria, Hungary, Bosnia
or the Yugoslav republic of Montenegro.
	   ``They will have to keep their policemen on all these countries
borders if they want to continue confiscating my paper,'' Curuvija
said.

Lee reasserts Taiwan's China stance to U.S. Cabinet official
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photos TPE104-105 &QL; 
 &UR; By CHRISTOPHER BODEEN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ Taiwan President Lee Teng-hui seized on a
rare visit by a U.S. Cabinet official Tuesday to make his case for
rejecting China's attempts to assert sovereignty over Taiwan.
	   Taiwan's government ``not only exists, but also strenuously
upholds democracy and freedom,'' Lee told U.S. Energy Secretary
Bill Richardson, according to a statement from Taiwan's
presidential office.
	   China has complained to Washington about the visit _ which it
says violates agreements that the United States has made with
Beijing to have nothing but unofficial contacts with Taiwan.
	   Richardson assured Lee that Washington's support for the island
remains steady _ although his presence here has been interpreted by
the Taiwanese as a U.S. effort to undo the damage done in the
summer, when President Bill Clinton went to Shanghai and said he
would not back Taiwan's efforts to assert itself internationally.
	   Taiwanese were severely rattled, believing Clinton's remarks
would encourage Beijing to try harder to isolate Taiwan.
	   Richardson said Tuesday that Washington supports Taiwan's entry
into the World Trade Organization on its own economic credentials.
China insists that Taiwan not precede it into the WTO, which sets
rules for global trade, but other U.S. officials also attending an
economic conference Tuesday said Washington will not attach
political considerations to Taiwan's entry.
	   Lee told Richardson that China must recognize Taiwan as an equal
partner in dialogue to permit real progress in their halting steps
toward a return to negotiations about improving ties between the
two rivals. The talks were suspended by China more than three years
ago.
	   Taiwan rejects China's call for it to recognize Beijing's
sovereignty, even symbolically, and condemns Beijing's refusal to
acknowledge the island's ruling Nationalist government.
	   Richardson is just the third U.S. Cabinet official to visit
Taiwan since the Clinton administration decided in 1994 to sanction
trips by technical and economic officials.
	   His presence here has brought a series of protests from China,
which considers the island a breakaway province and opposes any
high-level contact between Washington and Taipei.
	   China has made ``solemn representations'' to Washington over the
visit, which violates a commitment to have only unofficial contacts
with Taiwan, Zhu Bangzao, a Foreign Ministry spokesman, told
reporters in Beijing. The visit ``runs counter to the development
of China-U.S. relations,'' Zhu said.
	   ``The Chinese side expresses its serious concern and strong
dissatisfaction over that,'' he added.
	   China and Taiwan divided amid civil war in 1949.
	   Richardson said he came to Taipei to attend a joint economic
conference, but he also offered assurances to the Taiwanese that
relations with the United States remain friendly.
	   ``I must reiterate to Mr. President that the U.S. government's
policy toward Taiwan has not undergone any change whatsoever,'' the
presidential office quoted Richardson as telling Lee.
	   The United States, Taiwan's largest trading partner, receives 23
percent of the island's exports and accounts for 20 percent of its
imports. Two-way trade topped U.S. dlrs 52 billion in 1997.

Prolific author Rumer Godden dead at 90
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Rumer Godden, a prolific author whose imagination
was fired by living in India, has died at age 90.
	   Godden, who published her 21st novel, ``Cromartie vs. The God
Shiva,'' last year, died Sunday at her daughter's home in
Thornhill, Scotland, according to an obituary published Tuesday in
The Guardian. The cause of death was not announced.
	   She had her first major success with her third novel, ``Black
Narcissus,'' published in 1939. The story of a group of nuns who
establish a convent in northern India, it explored themes of
cultural conflict and obsessive love. It was made into a film
starring Deborah Kerr in 1947.
	   ``The River,'' published in 1949, was one of her most acclaimed
books and was made into a film by Jean Renoir in 1951.
	   Margaret Rumer Godden was born Dec. 10, 1907, in the south coast
city of Eastbourne. She was was 9 months old when her family moved
to India, where her father ran a shipping line.
	   ``Our house was streaked with Indian or Indian streaked with
English,'' Godden wrote in ``Two under the Indian Sun,'' and memoir
co-authored with her sister Jon Godden in 1966. ``It might have
been an uneasy hybrid but we were completely and happily at home.''
	   Godden and her three sisters were mostly educated at home.
``There was all the time in the world to think; avenues of time;
even our lessons were at a slow pace; we were not continually
brisked along, as happens to most children of school age,'' she
recalled.
	   She returned to London at age 20 to learn how to teach dance to
children, and opened a school back in India. She fell in love with
a stockbroker, Laurence Sinclair Foster, became pregnant and
married him. Returning to England while she was pregnant, she wrote
her first book, ``Chinese Puzzle,'' published in 1936.
	   The baby died at birth, but the ill-suited couple later had two
daughters. The marriage ended in 1941, and Foster left her
penniless and alone in Calcutta. ``I have distrusted charm ever
since,'' she said.
	   She tried to repay his debts, and moved her family into a
mountain cottage where she ran a school, made herbal teas for sale
and wrote books. The family survived an apparent poisoning attempt
by two servants, an episode which figured in her 1953 novel,
``Kingfishers Catch Fire.''
	   She returned to England to stay in 1945, and made a happy second
marriage in 1949 to James Haynes-Dixon, a civil servant. He died in
1973.
	   ``The Doll's House,'' the first of more than two dozen books for
children, appeared in 1947. Godden said the inspiration was to see
``if I could write a real novel--it's a murder story--in the tiny
compass of a doll's house, and make it acceptable for children.''
	   Godden is survived by her two daughters. Funeral arrangements
were not immediately announced.

Former judge protests ban for living with former prostitute
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SAINT-ETIENNE, France (AP) _ A judge who was struck off for
living with a former prostitute _ but won the pity of a former
French president _ on Tuesday entered the sixth day of a hunger
strike to demand the ban be lifted.
	   Philippe Le Friant, 50, was banned from office in 1988 by a
judicial council which ruled that he was guilty of ``an attack on
the honor of the magistracy.''
	   The Ministry of Justice in Paris referred to the impact of his
choice of partner as ``a gross disciplinary problem.''
	   His partner, who has not been identified, quit prostitution
while living with Le Friant.
	   Le Friant won a partial amnesty in 1993 from former President
Francois Mitterand who revoked the ban on judicial office. But it
did not stretch to automatically restoring his position as a judge.
	   ``My multiple moves, petitions and interventions for the last
five years haven't moved anybody at the Justice Ministry,'' Le
Friant told reporters.
	   ``Nothing, legally, can oppose me being re-integrated.''
	   Le Friant separated from his partner two years ago. Since his
ban he has worked as a chauffeur, factory worker, teacher and
judicial adviser.
	   Now working at a youth employment office in this southern town,
he advertised his hunger strike Thursday with a banner hanging from
his office. ``Service guaranteed,'' it said.
	   Le Friant's case has won the support of a local priest, two
authors and local celebrities.

Tajik troops search for remaining rebel fighters
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Government troops in Tajikistan searched northern
mountainous regions Tuesday for scattered groups of rebel fighters
who were driven off after several days of fighting in the Central
Asian nation.
	   The rebels, chased into the mountains of northern Tajikistan,
were trying to flee into neighboring Uzbekistan, the Tajik Interior
Ministry said, according to the Interfax news agency.
	   The government insisted they could not escape because the area
was surrounded, the border closed, and all roads cut off.
	   The government has said more than 200 people were killed, and
hundreds more were wounded in the latest fighting. A nationwide day
of mourning was declared for Tuesday.
	   Life was returning to normal Tuesday in the city of Khudzhand
and other areas where fighting raged, but telephone lines have not
been restored yet, Interfax reported.
	   Meanwhile, the rebel leader, former army Col. Makhmud
Khudoberdyev, remained at large. The government said he may have
fled to Uzbekistan, but the country denied harboring him or any
other rebels.
	   Khudoberdyev had demanded that President Emomali Rakhmonov free
all political prisoners and bring his supporters into the
government. The president refused to negotiate with the rebels.
	   The fighting follows a peace treaty last year that ended five
years of civil war between the Muslim opposition and Rakhmonov's
hard-line government.
	   The main opposition groups are now participating in the
government, but a number of warlords have refused to acknowledge
the peace accord and periodically launch attacks in the poor,
mountainous former Soviet republic.

Philippine Airlines, Cathay Pacific announce agreement on buy-in
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with PAL accepting investment offer by
Cathay Pacific; adds byline &QL; 
 &UR; By JIM GOMEZ &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Ailing Philippine Airlines has
accepted an investment offer from Hong Kong's Cathay Pacific
Airways, the two companies announced Tuesday.
	   The two airlines will now draw up a comprehensive plan to
rehabilitate PAL, they said in a statement.
	   The amount of capital to be infused by Cathay Pacific is still
to be determined, they said. It will be accompanied by an
additional investment by Lucio Tan, PAL's current chairman and main
stockholder, they added.
	   ``We are delighted that Cathay Pacific has demonstrated its
serious interest in PAL by moving to the stage of working with us
on an exclusive basis. We look forward to developing with them a
plan for PAL's rehabilitation,'' said Antonio Ocampo, who heads a
committee planning PAL's rehabilitation.
	   Tony Tyler, Cathay Pacific's director for corporate development,
said: ``We believe that with our resources and management
experience we can help re-establish PAL as a successful airline.''
	   The proposed investment is subject to several conditions,
including government approval and an agreement with creditors on
rescheduling PAL's dlrs 2.1 billion in liabilities, the companies
said.
	   Cathay Pacific has said it wants management control of the
Philippine flag carrier, which has been mired in debt and labor
unrest. A PAL official has said it is willing to grant that right
to Cathay Pacific.
	   Under Philippine law, Cathay could buy up to 40 percent of PAL.
	   President Joseph Estrada said he will agree to any setup in PAL
as long as it remains the country's flag carrier.
	   ``As long as PAL continues and as long as it remains the flag
carrier of the country, so be it,'' he said.
	   The government owns 14 percent of PAL, mostly held by public
financial institutions, pension funds and the defense forces.
	   PAL, Asia's oldest airline, has been unable to make payments on
its debt after being devastated by a pilots' strike and by Asia's
currency crisis.
	   PAL shut down its operations on Sept. 23 after the ground crew
union turned down a management-proposed recovery plan that included
a 10-year suspension of labor's collective bargaining agreement in
exchange for 20 percent ownership of the airline.
	   Workers agreed to accept the plan nearly two weeks after the
shutdown, and the airline resumed domestic flights Oct. 7 and
international flights to the United States on Oct. 26.
	   PAL is to resume flights to Hong Kong and Tokyo on Wednesday. It
plans to restart flights to Singapore, Taipei, Fukuoka and Osaka in
the next few weeks.

	   Here is a summary of news from The Associated Press. Stories
carried ``i'' or ``f'' category codes. Some of the items below have
moved on this circuit in expanded form:
	   SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP) _ Helicopters roared into the
hills with aid for the starving and Central American leaders faced
the task of rebuilding after Hurricane Mitch set their countries
back 50 years. The presidents of four nations appealed to lenders
and creditors for help in the aftermath of a storm that laid their
economies to waste and took an estimated 10,000 lives. ``In 72
hours, we lost what we had built, little by little, in 50 years,''
Honduran President Carlos Flores Facusse said Monday after a
regional summit. He called his country's dlrs 4.2 billion debt
``unpayable.'' Former U.S. president Jimmy Carter and French Prime
Minister Lionel Jospin have supported pardoning the foreign debt of
countries ravaged by Mitch. German Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer
said some debts should be forgiven for Honduras and Nicaragua,
which owes dlrs 6 billion. But even that may not be enough. ``We
need new financing to rebuild the country,'' said Nicaraguan
President Arnoldo Aleman. ``It's no use pardoning the foreign debt
if we don't have immediate aid.'' (MITCH)
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Despite a massive security clampdown
across the capital, protests and street clashes among rock-throwing
mobs Tuesday marred the opening of a government assembly convened
to carve out a new political future for crisis-ridden Indonesia.
The People's Consultative Assembly met at the national Parliament,
protected from the violence by razor wire barricades and thousands
of armed troops. In several areas, pro- and anti-government
activists threw rocks and brawled before being broken up by
soldiers. Critics doubt that the 1,000-member assembly, Indonesia's
highest legislative body, will deliver on promises to dismantle the
32-year-old authoritarian legacy of former President Suharto, who
quit in May after a wave of deadly riots and protests.
(INDONESIA-POLITICS)
	   BEIJING (AP) _ North Korea is entering its fourth winter of
chronic food shortages with its people malnourished and at risk of
dying from normally curable illnesses, senior Red Cross officials
said Tuesday. The officials warned against international
complacency and hostility toward North Korea as the food crisis
stretches on and the isolated communist country shows little
willingness to adopt far-reaching changes to revive its ruined
economy. ``Humanitarian suffering cannot be routine in any part of
the world,'' said Margareta Wahlstrom, the Red Cross'
undersecretary of disaster relief, who returned to Beijing Tuesday
after a week inspecting the aid agency's operations in North Korea.

case of divided Cyprus, some EU members wonder aloud if it should
come in at all. Cyprus urged the European Union to push Turkey into
helping end the division of the Mediterranean island and not
obstruct the EU membership drive of the Greek Cypriots. Opening
formal membership talks with the EU, Cypriot Foreign Minister
Ioannis Kasoulides stressed that a solution could lead to
reunification of the island communities and improve Greek-Turkish
relations. Later, the EU foreign ministers met with their
colleagues from candidate nations Poland, Hungary, the Czech
Republic, Slovenia and Estonia. (EU-ENLARGEMENT)
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Whatever Arab and European governments may be
saying privately, they are offering little public support for an
attack on Iraq. And that narrows President Bill Clinton's options
and possibly what a solitary U.S. strike could accomplish. State
Department spokesman James P. Rubin said Washington doesn't feel
lonely, broadly hinting the West Europeans and the Arab states
privately have pledged to assist U.S. forces in the event of an
attack. In any event, Rubin said Monday, ``changes we have made to
our forces in the region over the last several months ensure that
an adequate level of forces exists in the Gulf, should their use be
necessary.'' (US-IRAQ)

	   LONDON (AP) _ Rumer Godden, a prolific author whose imagination
was fired by living in India, has died at age 90.

Shiva,'' last year, died Sunday in a nursing home near her
daughter's home in Thornhill, Scotland, said Suzanne Baboneau,
spokeswoman for Macmillan, Godden's publisher. The cause of death

	   A summary of financial and business news from The Associated
Press at 0000 GMT. Stories carry ``f'' or ``i'' category codes and
move on this circuit in expanded form:
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Most Asian stock markets slumped Tuesday, with
the key index in Bangkok tumbling more than 7 percent on
profit-taking after soaring last week. The Stock Exchange of
Thailand index fell 27.23 points, or 7.5 percent, closing at
336.62. In Seoul, the main index fell 21.21 points, or 5 percent,
to 403.24, after the U.S. dollar rose to its highest level against
the Japanese currency in a month. A weaker yen causes South Korean
manufacturers to lose their price competitiveness against their
Japanese rivals because they vie directly in such key industries as
automobiles and semiconductors. The dollar was quoted at 122.32 yen
in late afternoon, up 2.96 yen from late Monday in Tokyo. Tokyo's
benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average fell 0.61 percent, or
86.45 points, closing at 14,108.09. (ASIAN MARKETS)
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia has reached a tentative agreement on food
aid with the European Union just days after completing a similar
deal with the United States, news reports said Tuesday. Under the
plan, Russia would purchase food worth 400 million European
currency units (dlrs 480 million) and receive E.U. humanitarian aid
worth 10 million to 12 million ecus (dlrs 12 to 14 million), Deputy
Prime Minister Gennady Kulik said, according to Russian news
agencies. The two sides will meet shortly to finalize the deal, he
said. EU officials said Monday that a deal was in the works, but
have not yet announced any agreement. (RUSSIA-ECONOMY)
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder pledged
Tuesday during his first major policy speech to put Germans back to
work and give the nation a new optimism about the future. In his
inaugural address to parliament, Schroeder said he would modernize
Europe's biggest economy and promote private initiative but also
put new emphasis on a government that provides for society's
weakest members. That theme, touted by some in Europe's new left as
the ``Third Way'' between pure capitalism and a strong social
welfare state, helped the younger Schroeder unseat longtime leader
Helmut Kohl in September. ``People in Germany don't lack creative
forces,'' Schroeder declared. ``We will help make them unfold.''
(GERMANY-SCHROEDER)
	   SHANGHAI, China (AP) _ Trying to avoid the economic woes of its
neighbors, China says its economy is perking up, helped by a
planned dlrs 1.2 trillion spending binge on new highways and other
public works projects. Nobody, though, but China is likely to
benefit. Trade barriers that shield East Asia's second-biggest
economy from regional turmoil mean higher growth will not spill
over to its struggling Asian neighbors or push up imports from the
United States and Europe. Washington complains that China may even
be erecting new obstacles to imports, which could hurt Thailand,
South Korea and other neighbors whose cheap, smuggled imports
funnel up to dlrs 30 billion a year to their stricken economies.
(CHINA-SHARING THE WEALTH)
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Activists opposed to a Pacific Rim
summit's emphasis on trade and currency trading descended Tuesday
on Malaysia, opening an alternative conference critical of the
government leaders' agenda. The Asia-Pacific People's Summit brings
together 700 activists and unionists from 25 countries. They are
hoping their message will be heard by leaders attending next week's
21-nation summit meeting of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation
group. Both conferences are being held in the Malaysian capital,
Kuala Lumpur. Participants plan to discuss human rights, the
environment, poverty and other issues they say are being trampled
in the rush toward globalization. (MALAYSIA-ANTI-APEC SUMMIT)
	   TOKYO (AP) _ South Korea and Thailand are over the worst of the
Asian economic crisis, but grinding poverty still stands in the way
of recovery in Indonesia, the president of the World Bank said
Tuesday. ``We've come a long way in Korea and Thailand in building
the economic and financial base ... to try to stabilize the
economic situation,'' James Wolfensohn told reporters in Tokyo. The
two countries have largely overcome the ``worst excesses'' of
problems of interest rates, foreign reserves and lack of credit, he
said. Indonesia, however, is making slower progress, in part
because it was poorer than South Korea and Thailand before the
Asian financial crisis hit last year, Wolfensohn said. For example,
60 million Indonesians are surviving on just dlrs 2 a day, while
another 15 million scrape by on a daily budget of dlr 1 or less, he
said. Private debt to foreign creditors also totals dlrs 60
billion. (JAPAN-WORLD BANK)

Plan to repatriate Bosnian refugees fizzles out
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ A plan to repatriate tens of
thousands of Bosnian refugees has flopped after it led to bickering
among the parties in the Dutch governing coalition.
	   The decision means that Bosnians who have sought shelter in the
Netherlands and have been granted permanent residency will be
allowed to stay, Justice Ministry spokeswoman Maud Bredero said
Tuesday.
	   Last week, the centrist Democrats 66 party, a junior coalition
partner, called for the repatriation of Bosnian refugees with
so-called ``A-status,'' meaning they are allowed to stay in the
country permanently as political asylum seekers.
	   The plan riled Prime Minister Wim Kok's left-leaning Labor Party
and sparked a row among coalition partners.
	   After days of debate, Democrats 66 said it will scrap the push
because the country's overburdened immigration service would be
unable to process all the cases.
	   An estimated 25,000 Bosnian refugees are in the Netherlands, and
about 17,000 were granted A-status between 1992 and 1998, Bredero
said.
	   Although the parties wrangled over refugees with A-status, they
did agree that refugees with a temporary permit should return once
conditions in their home countries have improved.

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Despite a massive security clampdown
across the capital, protests and street clashes among rock-throwing
mobs Tuesday marred the opening of a government assembly convened
to carve out a new political future for crisis-ridden Indonesia.
	   The People's Consultative Assembly met at the national
Parliament, protected from the violence by razor wire barricades
and thousands of armed troops.
	   In several areas, pro- and anti-government activists threw rocks
and brawled before being broken up by soldiers.
	   Much of Tuesday's trouble involved teen-age boys, armed with
knives and bamboo spears. As many as 120,000 have been recruited by
pro-government activists as private security guards to protect the
assembly from student protests.
	   Hundreds of them confronted 5,000 anti-government students
protesters on a busy road near the University of Indonesia.
	   Outside the legislature, rival groups also clashed briefly.
Troops blocked off a toll road and dispersed the crowd with sticks
but made no arrests.
	   In East Jakarta, hundreds of the pro-government guards threw
rocks and fought with local residents, who later surrounded them in
a tense standoff. Witnesses said several people were injured. One
automobile was set afire.
	   About 30,000 troops and police have been deployed across Jakarta
to safeguard the assembly meeting.
	   Critics doubt that the 1,000-member assembly, Indonesia's
highest legislative body, will deliver on promises to dismantle the
32-year-old authoritarian legacy of former President Suharto, who
quit in May after a wave of deadly riots and protests.
	   However, Parliament Speaker Harmoko, once a dogmatic and loyal
Suharto supporter, warned that anarchy could engulf the world's
fourth most populous nation unless fundamental political changes
were made to meet the reform demands of 202 million Indonesians.
	   The assembly is meeting for four days as Indonesia grapples with
its worst economic crisis in decades.
	   Inflation and unemployment are soaring, and millions of people
are sinking into poverty. Rioting and looting have occurred
sporadically for months in many areas.
	   The assembly's main job is to set a date sometime in late May
for parliamentary elections and to help frame new laws to legalize
free political parties.
	   ``We regard the general election as the best way for the people
to determine their own future in a democratic manner,'' Harmoko
said.
	   Harmoko said the assembly, made up of 475 legislators and 625
government appointees, would revoke old decrees that preserved
special presidential powers during the Suharto era. It would also
promote human rights and clean government.
	   In a sign of compromise, military chief Gen. Wiranto has said
that the armed forces are willing to discuss demands to limit their
prominent role in politics, which now gives them a guaranteed 75
seats in the 500-member Parliament.
	   One proposal is to cut its representation down to 55 seats.
	   Despite promises of change, opponents claim most of the
assembly's members are holdovers from the Suharto era.
	   With Indonesia's main opposition figures not part of the
assembly, critics fear it will try to bolster the position of
current President B.J. Habibie.
	   Habibie, a longtime friend and former loyal aide of Suharto,
plans to stand as a presidential candidate next year.
	   Habibie was applauded warmly when he attended Tuesday's opening
session. But he did not speak so as to avoid giving the impression
that he was trying to sway the delegates.
	   In a show of discontent, Indonesia's three main opposition
figures held their first joint meeting since Suharto's downfall and
demanded that the government disband the private security groups.
	   Megawati Sukarnoputri, the daughter of Indonesia's founding
president, and Islamic leaders Abdurahman Wahid and Amein Rais also
called on the military to phase out its role in politics.
	   They demanded that a presidential election be held three months
after next May's parliamentary election, instead of in December as
planned by Habibie.
	   At a rally earlier Tuesday, hundreds of students called on the
assembly to disband. They also demanded that Habibie quit and that
the military get out of politics altogether.
	   They also called for Suharto to be tried for corruption.

Lebanese premier accuses Israel of stalling on peace deal
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: CORRECTS that Hariri left for Saudi Arabia sted Lebanon in
final graf. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Hariri on
Tuesday accused Israel of stalling in implementing a
land-for-security deal with the Palestinians.
	   Hariri made the comment after a one-hour meeting with President
Hosni Mubarak on the Mideast peace process. The Egyptian leader did
not speak to reporters, but he has recently expressed doubts Israel
would implement the American-mediated Wye accord.
	   ``It is obvious the Israeli government is stalling,'' Hariri
told reporters, referring to the accord calling for Israel to
withdraw from a further 13 percent of the West Bank in exchange for
stepped up Palestinian security against attacks on Israelis.
	   He said that Egypt was ``cautiously'' waiting for implementation
of the agreement and that Lebanon hoped the United States would
help put accord into effect.
	   The Oct. 23 Palestinian-Israeli pact has already fallen a week
behind schedule. Arab states have blamed Israel for the delay, But
Israel said it was waiting for Palestinians to outlaw armed wings
of Islamic groups.
	   After a suicide bombing in a Jerusalem market on Friday,
Israel's Cabinet suspended indefinitely debate over the agreement
until the Palestinians do more to fight Islamic militant groups.
	   Hariri also praised Egyptian-Lebanese economic relations and
said a trade agreement signed in October is expected to further
boost trade.
	   He later flew to Saudi Arabia at the end of a four-day visit to
Egypt. It was not clear if he would meet with Saudi officials.

Search continues for abducted foreigners after Angolan mine attack
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LUANDA, Angola (AP) _ Troops and police Tuesday combed the
jungle of northeast Angola for four foreign workers abducted by
gunmen during an attack on a Canadian diamond mine.
	   The missing workers included one Briton, according to the
British Embassy which declined to identify the man. The
nationalities of the other three men were not immediately
available.
	   Gunmen attacked the mine at Yetwene, a remote mining village
about 600 kilometers (370 miles) east of the capital Luanda, before
dawn Sunday, killing five employees and wounding 18 others,
according to Vancouver-based DiamondWorks Ltd..
	   Diplomats in Luanda identified the dead as Britons Alan Thomas,
49, and David Boutle, 26, and Portuguese-born South African Antonio
Vasconcelos. The identity of the other two dead, both Angolans, was
not made known.
	   The Luanda spokesman for Canada's Branch Energy, which owns
DiamondWorks, said the company's chief executive officer Bruce
Walsham was due to arrive in the Angolan capital late Tuesday.
	   Walsham would hold talks with officials and visit the Yetwene
mine, Gaspar Cardoso said.
	   A spokesman for the South African Embassy said the army and
police units arrived at the scene shortly after the attack, carried
out by an unknown number of gunmen.
	   ``The security forces cleaned out the area,'' Ebrahim Edreis
said. ``But the situation in the north is very tense,'' he added.
	   The diamond-rich northeast has been the scene of renewed clashes
in recent months between government forces and the remnants of the
former rebel group UNITA's guerrilla army.
	   A United Nations-brokered peace pact signed four years ago ended
two decades of civil war, but lingering hostility between the
former foes has prevented its full implementation.
	   Gangs of armed bandits, made up mostly of demobilized soldiers,

EU opens formal enlargement talks amid anxiety about Cyprus,

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ Cyprus urged the European Union Tuesday
to push Turkey into helping end the division of the Mediterranean
island and not obstruct the EU membership drive of the Greek
Cypriots.
	   Opening formal membership talks with the EU, Cypriot Foreign
Minister Ioannis Kasoulides stressed his government's commitment to
the ``search of a viable and just solution.'' Reunification of the
island communities would also lead to a ``substantial improvement''
in Greek-Turkish relations, he said.
	   Cyprus _ plus Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic, Slovenia and
Estonia _ opened formal membership talks. Last week, the EU judged
these countries to have made a good start of transposing EU rules
and regulations into their national statutes.
	   Hungarian Foreign Minister Janos Martonyi said his country is
determined to join in 2002 though the EU has set no date for any
candidate. ``There are no genuine points of dispute. This gives us
hope that (entry in 2002) is possible,'' he told reporters.
	   The problems of Cyprus loomed large Tuesday, one day after the
Dutch, German and French governments issued a rare declaration
questioning the wisdom of admitting Cyprus unless the Mediterranean
island is first reunified.
	   Kasoulides said the three should have addressed themselves to
Turkey which has been criticized for hampering United Nations
efforts to reunify Greek and Turkish Cypriots.
	   The three EU members said the division of Cyprus weighed on the
island's membership chances.
	   Turkey invaded the northern one-third of Cyprus in 1974 and
installed a government, backed by 30,000 troops. The government is
only recognized by Turkey.
	   ``I wish to reiterate once again that the government of Cyprus,
despite the absence of positive developments and the hardening of
the Turkish position, ... devotes all its powers and exerts all its
efforts in search of a viable and just solution,'' Kasoulides told
the EU foreign ministers.
	   Sources said there was a fear in the EU of importing
Greek-Turkish rivalry by admitting Cyprus and that once inside the
EU Greek Cypriots _ the only government the international community
recognizes on the island _ may hamper reunification and keep
Turkish Cypriots out of the union.
	   Austrian Foreign Minister Wolfgang Schuessel downplayed the
statement of the Dutch, German and French governments saying it
remained the EU view Cyprus was a valid candidate and that
membership talks can encourage U.N. reconciliation efforts on the
island.
	   After meeting with Kasoulides, the EU foreign ministers met in
one-on-one sessions with their colleagues from Poland, Hungary, the
Czech Republic, Slovenia and Estonia.
	   The list of would-be EU members also includes Lithuania, Latvia,
Slovakia, Romania and Bulgaria but these countries are in a second
group of less-ready nations.
	   On Monday, the leaders of Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia, at a
meeting in Oslo, complained the EU moved so slowly it could
destabilize the Baltic region. Conventional wisdom has it that the
most successful candidates will not join before 2004.
	   Lithuanian Prime Minister Gediminas Vagnorious warned of
``unnecessary tensions'' that could complicate relations with
Russia and other neighbors unless the EU accelerated its screening
of candidates.
	   Formal membership negotiations with Cyprus and five East
European nations open several days after the European Commission
declared the expansion drive ``broadly on track.'' It said all
candidates were pursuing the necessary economic and political
reforms.
	   The Commission said Latvia, Lithuania and Slovakia do so well
they may be advanced to the group of fast-track candidates as of
1999.
	   But on Monday, French Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine cautioned
against advancing countries from the slower group saying that could
leave Romania and Bulgaria, which face the toughest task in meeting
membership criteria, out in the cold.

Juventus seeking Ravanelli, reports say
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TURIN, Italy (AP) _ Juventus of Turin is considering signing
Fabrizio Ravanelli as a replacement for its injured striker
Alessandro Del Piero, news reports said Tuesday.
	   ``He is Juventus' real aim,'' wrote the Turin-based La Stampa on
Tuesday. ``He knows the Italian league and would be happy to come
back to Italy,'' the paper claimed.
	   Sports daily Gazzetta dello Sport also indicated Ravanelli,
who's currently playing with Olympique Marseille in France, as a
candidate to replace Del Piero, who will be out for five months
with a knee injury.
	   Official contacts with Olympique officials will start within
days, La Stampa said. However Juventus will have to wait until the
Italian transfer market reopens, on Jan 4, to get the striker.
	   Ravanelli has already played with Juventus, but left it in 1996
to join Middlesbrough, England.

Easing the pain _ researchers look into brain's role
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JANE E. ALLEN &QC; 
 &UR; AP Science Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) _ The tiniest and most innocuous touch _ even
the cool breeze of an air-conditioned room _ can cause terrible
sensations to those suffering from chronic pain.
	   Discoveries about pain and its routes through the brain and
nervous system give hope that new methods can ease the suffering,
researchers at the annual meeting of the Society for Neuroscience
said Monday.
	   ``The brain can be confused into thinking something is
painful,'' said Lorne Mendell of the State University of New York
at Stony Brook. If that can be understood, ``one can try to devise
therapeutic methods to basically damp down chronic pain.''
	   Low-dose anti-depressants have been found effective among some
sufferers of chronic pain syndromes. But there's also great
interest in harnessing the body's natural painkillers.
	   The researchers agreed that dummy pills that yield relief in
some patients somehow activate the body's pain-modulating systems.
	   ``It's real. It's not imagined,'' said Catherine Bushnell of
McGill University in Canada.
	   ``I don't think we're ever going to find the magic bullet that
works for all types of pain,'' said Ronald Dubner of the University
of Maryland. He suggested there may be a need for medications that
can work at the site of the injury and others that work on the
central nervous system.
	   Ms. Bushnell said that once the central nervous system has been
damaged by a stroke or a disease like multiple sclerosis, a person
can experience ongoing pain so severe that even lightly brushing
the skin causes a terrible burning sensation.
	   In brain imaging studies in which patients place hands in
painfully hot water, she has seen a ``signature'' of pain in four
parts of the brain's outer layer, called the cerebral cortex.
	   She and fellow researchers were able to increase or decrease the
activity in some of those regions through hypnosis or distraction
techniques, which teach the nervous system to reinterpret the
sensation, she said.
	   Dubner is studying the brain stem and its role in controlling
aspects of chronic pain. Some pain sends a barrage of impulses into
the central nervous system and over time can alter the receptors on
the surface of nerve cells. The receptors become sensitive to the
signals and can produce exaggerated pain sensations.
	   ``It appears that with chronic pain, weak signals from an old
site of injury are sufficient to maintain this effect,'' he said.
	   Dubner and colleagues found that some areas of the brain stem
dampen the pain while others increase it.

Russian Communists reject calls to ban their party
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By VLADIMIR ISACHENKOV &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Communist leader Gennady Zyuganov said Tuesday
that it would be futile to try to ban the party, which has come
under sharp criticism for failing to strongly condemn a member's
outspoken anti-Semitism.
	   ``The party stands for outlook and ideology, and you can't ban
it by decree, you can only fight it by using a better ideology,''
Zyuganov told reporters.
	   Any attempts to ban the party are ``bound to failure,'' he said.
	   Zyuganov's remarks came after several prominent businessmen and
politicians called for banning the party because it failed to
condemn Communist lawmaker Albert Makashov for his anti-Semitic
remarks.
	   In speeches last month, Makashov blamed the country's problems
on ``zhidy'' or ``yids,'' a slur against Jews.
	   Communists in parliament blocked a resolution last week
condemning Makashov's remarks. And a number of his party colleagues
defended him in speeches at Saturday rallies celebrating the 81st
anniversary of the 1917 Russian revolution, which brought the
Communist Party to power.
	   Boris Berezovsky, one of the country's richest and most powerful
businessmen, and a favorite target of Russian anti-Semites,
continued to call for the ban Tuesday.
	   ``They only call themselves Communists, but, in fact, they are
fascists,'' Berezovsky said Tuesday, according to the Interfax news
agency. ``We must convince society that the Communist Party is like
a cancerous tumor that must be cut.''
	   Moscow Mayor Yuri Luzhkov called Makashov's remarks
``repulsive,'' but said that they hardly can serve as a reason for
banning the party. ``The government would like to do that, but has
no power and will to do that,'' he said of the ban.
	   Russian prosecutors have been looking into Makashov's statements
for more than a month, but haven't announced any conclusions yet.
Makashov enjoys immunity from prosecution as a lawmaker, and
Communists could try to block any attempt to waive his immunity.
	   Other politicians said that the government would need documented
proof that anti-Semitism was the official policy of the party in
order to ban it.
	   Yeltsin banned the Communist Party for one year in the early
1990s, but the party remains the country's leading opposition group
and has the largest faction in parliament's lower house, the State
Duma.

Officer says police coerced retractions in Anwar case

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ A police official testified
Tuesday that he had coerced two key witnesses into retracting
sexual misconduct allegations against Anwar Ibrahim, allegedly on
orders from the former deputy prime minister himself.
	   Anwar's trial on sex and corruption charges has captured
worldwide attention. He was once in line to rule this country of 22
million people, but is now seeking to ward off a lengthy prison
term and political oblivion.
	   The trial stems in part from Anwar's clash with his one-time
mentor, 72-year-old Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad.
	   During a recess in Tuesday's proceedings, Anwar was asked his
reaction to the decision by U.S. President Bill Clinton and
Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien to snub private talks with
Mahathir during a trade summit next week.
	   ``Mahathir should consider it (the snub) serious. Even foreign
leaders reject him,'' Anwar told reporters, adding that Malaysians
themselves have rejected Mahathir.
	   Tuesday's testimony focused on statements by Ummi Hafilda, who
said Anwar had sex with the wife of his own personal secretary.
Ummi is the male secretary's sister. The court was also considering
statements by Azizan Abu Bakar, Anwar's former driver, who claims
the defendant sodomized him.
	   Both later retracted their allegations, in what prosecutors
claim was a deliberate cover-up attempt by Anwar while he was still
in power as deputy prime minister.
	   Abdul Aziz Husin of the police Special Branch testified that he
and other officers interrogated Ummi all night and threatened to
jail her indefinitely without trial if she didn't retract her
allegations.
	   ``These combined approaches subjected her to intense mental
pressures until she lost the will to resist and succumbed to the
interrogation team,'' Abdul Aziz told the court.
	   The barrel-chested officer said he used similar techniques on
Azizan, and added that his interrogation team threatened to
physically harm the two people.
	   ``Can I demonstrate?'' Abdul Aziz asked Raja Aziz Addruse, one
of Anwar's defense lawyers, from the witness stand.
	   Abdul Aziz stood up, yelled into the microphone and swung his
arm at Raja Aziz. The public gallery, packed with reporters, fell
into a stunned silence as his yell reverberated throughout the
courtroom.
	   ``I won't do that again, My Lord,'' the defense lawyer told High
Court Judge Augustine Paul. ``I got frightened.''
	   Both Ummi and Azizan eventually wrote retraction letters but
Ummi was asked to revise her letter because she wasn't ``firm and
committed'' enough in denying her allegations against Anwar.
	   ``She took a long time to give in,'' Abdul Aziz said. ``She was
shaken and began to cry. I took around two hours to convince her.''
	   After police made editorial changes to her letter, Ummi finally
signed it.
	   The trial has become a point of contention with Malaysia about
to play host to a summit of Asia-Pacific leaders, including U.S.
President Bill Clinton, next week. Critics say the trial and
allegations that police beat the 51-year-old Anwar highlight the
country's human rights abuses.
	   Anwar, dressed casually in a white shirt with no tie, sat in the
defendant's dock and appeared unmoved by Tuesday's testimony.
	   Last week, the first witness, former Special Branch Chief
Mohamed Said Awang, testified that Anwar had forced police to
arrest and coerce retractions from the two. Mohamed said he later
wrote a report to the prime minister saying the accusations were
fabricated.
	   Anwar was arrested Sept. 20, two weeks after he was fired by
Mahathir, setting off anti-government protests. Anwar has pleaded
innocent to 10 charges of corruption and illegal sex acts, saying
the charges were fabricated because Mahathir feared Anwar might
challenge his 17-year rule.
	   Diplomats, international human rights and jurist groups are
sitting in on the trial, which is expected to last well into next
year.

Coalition leaders decide to cut the number of ministries
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ Leaders of the governing coalition
decided Tuesday to reduce the number of government ministries as
part of an effort to streamline government work and speed up
economic reforms.
	   Prime Minister Radu Vasile met the leaders of the five coalition
parties and decided to abolish five of the 22 ministries. The
Privatization and Reform ministries were disbanded, the two
portfolios being put under the direct resonsibility of the premier.
	   The Communications, Research and Tourism ministries were to be
downgraded to national agencies. The leader of a national agency is
not a member of the government.
	   ``We wanted to form a government of only 18 ministers, including
the prime minister,'' said after the meeting the leader of Peasant
Party, Ion Diaconescu.
	   The changes will be formally approved by the government shortly.

Abacha family returns more than dlrs 625 million to Nigeria
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ABUJA, Nigeria (AP) _ The family of Nigeria's late dictator,
Gen. Sani Abacha, has handed back to the government more than dlrs
750 million in state funds illegally amassed by the former leader,
a government spokesman said.
	   The money _ including about dlrs 625 million, 75 million British
pounds and dlrs 3 million worth of Nigeria naira _ has been
deposited into a special account at the Central Bank of Nigeria,
government spokesman Mohammed Haruna told reporters Monday.
	   During his 5-year military dictatorship, Abacha diverted
hundreds of millions of dollars in government funds to his personal
accounts. Since his death in June, Abacha's family has returned
vast sums of money.
	   Others in Abacha's government also siphoned money from the state
to amass personal fortunes. Nigeria's former finance minister,
Anthony Ani, said Abacha's national security adviser Ismail Gwarzo
had channeled about dlrs 1.3 billion worth of foreign reserves into
private accounts.
	   Although accustomed to military rule and conflict, Nigeria
suffered enormously under Abacha, whose leadership was marked by
divisive policies, endemic and institutionalized corruption and
brutal repression.
	   Abacha was replaced by another military leader, Gen. Abdulsalami
Abubakar, who was vowed to hand power over to an elected civilian
government. Abubakar has been working to free political prisoners
and redress the financial mismanagement that marked Abacha's
tenure.

Philippine Airlines, Cathay Pacific announce agreement on buy-in
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Estrada welcoming agreement, 6th graf &QL; 
 &UR; By JIM GOMEZ &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Ailing Philippine Airlines has
accepted an investment offer from Hong Kong's Cathay Pacific
Airways, the two companies announced Tuesday.
	   The two airlines will now draw up a comprehensive plan to
rehabilitate PAL, they said in a statement.
	   The amount of capital to be infused by Cathay Pacific is still
to be determined, they said. It is to be accompanied by an
additional investment by Lucio Tan, PAL's current chairman and main
stockholder, they added.
	   ``We are delighted that Cathay Pacific has demonstrated its
serious interest in PAL by moving to the stage of working with us
on an exclusive basis. We look forward to developing with them a
plan for PAL's rehabilitation,'' said Antonio Ocampo, who heads a
committee planning PAL's rehabilitation.
	   Tony Tyler, Cathay Pacific's director for corporate development,
said: ``We believe that with our resources and management
experience we can help re-establish PAL as a successful airline.''
	   President Joseph Estrada welcomed the agreement, his executive
secretary, Ronaldo Zamora, said, adding that PAL needed fresh
capital from a serious investor, foreign or local.
	   The proposed investment is subject to several conditions,
including government approval and an agreement with creditors on
rescheduling PAL's dlrs 2.1 billion in liabilities, the companies
said.
	   Cathay Pacific has said it wants management control of the
Philippine flag carrier, which has been mired in debt and labor
unrest. A PAL official has said it is willing to grant that right.
	   Under Philippine law, Cathay could buy up to 40 percent of PAL.
	   Estrada said he will agree to any setup in PAL as long as it
remains the country's flag carrier.
	   ``As long as PAL continues and as long as it remains the flag
carrier of the country, so be it,'' he said earlier Tuesday.
	   The government owns 14 percent of PAL, mostly held by public
financial institutions, pension funds and the defense forces.
	   PAL, Asia's oldest airline, has been unable to make payments on
its debt after being devastated by a pilots' strike and by Asia's
currency crisis.
	   PAL shut down its operations on Sept. 23 after the ground crew
union turned down a management-proposed recovery plan that included
a 10-year suspension of labor's collective bargaining agreement in
exchange for 20 percent ownership of the airline.
	   Workers agreed to accept the plan nearly two weeks after the
shutdown, and the airline resumed domestic flights Oct. 7 and
international flights to the United States on Oct. 26.
	   PAL is to resume flights to Hong Kong and Tokyo on Wednesday. It
plans to restart flights to Singapore, Taipei, Fukuoka and Osaka in
the next few weeks.

Ireland names 20-man squad for Euro qualifier
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DUBLIN, Ireland (AP) _ Ireland manager Mick McCarthy named a
20-man squad Tuesday for next week's Group Eight European
Championship qualifier against Yugoslavia in Belgrade.
	   McCarthy invoked the five-day rule on the release of players for
competitive international games, meaning none of the squad will be
available to their clubs for this weekend's English Premier League
and First Division games.
	   The players will assemble in Dublin for a first training session
on Saturday afternoon.
	   ``It would have been remiss of me not to invoke the five-day
rule as this is such an important game for Ireland,'' McCarthy
said.
	   The match was originally scheduled for Oct. 10 but was postponed
because of the crisis in Kosovo and threat of NATO air strikes.
	   With the easing of tensions, UEFA last week gave the go-ahead
for the match on Nov. 18.
	   McCarthy called up three Liverpool players, including defender
Phil Babb, who has not played for four weeks after being injured
colliding with an upright in a Premiership game with Chelsea.
	   Babb missed last month's 5-0 victory over Malta.
	   This time, injuries rob McCarthy of Wolves striker Robbie Keane
and Derby midfielder Lee Carsley, while Tottenham defender Stephen
Carr and Wimbledon winger Mark Kennedy were dropped.
	   Wolves striker David Connolly, who scored four goals in
Saturday's 6-1 victory over Bristol City, returns after serving a
two match suspension.
	   Bradford midfielder Gareth Whalley is one of two uncapped
players in the squad.
	   With maximum points from their two opening games against Croatia
and Malta, the Irish top the Group Eight table. They are level on
points with Croatia, which has played an extra game and has an
inferior goal difference.
	   The squad:
	   Shay Given (Newcastle), Dean Kiely (Bury), Dennis Irwin
(Manchester United), Jeff Kenna (Blackburn), Steve Staunton
(Liverpool), Ian Harte (Leeds), Kenny Cunningham (Wimbledon), Phil
Babb (Liverpool), Gary Breen (Coventry), Roy Keane (Manchester
United), Mark Kinsella (Charlton), Alan McLoughlin (Portsmouth),
Jason McAteer (Liverpool), Damien Duff (Blackburn), Gareth Whalley
(Bradford), Tony Cascarino (Nancy), Niall Quinn (Sunderland), Rory
Delap (Derby), David Connolly (Wolves), Keith O'Neill (Norwich).

Estrada says foreign investors returning to Philippine markets
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Recent gains by the peso and the
local stock market show that foreign investors are returning to the
Philippines, President Joseph Estrada said Tuesday.
	   ``They now see the Philippines as being in much better shape
than most of its neighbors, and more ready to take advantage of
improvements in the global economy,'' Estrada said.
	   The past two weeks have seen relatively hefty portfolio
investments in the stock market and substantial foreign exchange
remittances from Filipinos working overseas.
	   Both inflows have enabled the peso to book substantial gains
against the dollar.
	   However, both the stock market and peso lost some of their
recent gains Tuesday, with the main stock index falling 4.4 percent
and the peso falling 1.6 percent against the dollar in response to
a sharp fall in the Japanese yen.
	   Estrada noted with approval the economic growth in the
Philippines in the first half of the year, while many other
economies in the region contracted. Inflation, which averaged 9.3
percent in the first nine months, was also well below the level in
other Southeast Asian countries hurt by the region's currency
crisis, he said.
	   ``The crisis has not spared the country but the house we are
building remains intact,'' Estrada said. ``Moreover, if we survey
the landscape, we would see that our house is one of the few left
standing.''
	   He pledged to continue the economic policies and reforms started
by his predecessors, which he said have proven beneficial to the
economy.
	   Specifically, he said, the government will continue with
liberalization and deregulation.
	   Estrada said the Philippine banking system remains stable and is
one of the best capitalized in the region.
	   With an average capital adequacy ratio of 18 percent, Philippine
banks are as well-protected as their counterparts in the more
established financial centers of Hong Kong and Singapore, he said.
	   He also said he will continue to hit hard against kidnapping
syndicates to give investors a better business climate.
	   Estrada reiterated that capital controls would not be used to
stabilize the peso and that exchange rates would remain
market-oriented.

Brittan: EU to respond to any US sanctions through WTO, not
</HEADLINE>
unilaterally &QL; 
 &UR; By ANNA SATHIAH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ The European Union's Foreign Trade
Commissioner said Tuesday the EU will complain to the World Trade
Organization if the United States presses ahead with sanctions to
counter the EU's banana import regime.
	   Sir Leon Brittan said the EU, unlike the United States, would
not take any unilateral action outside the WTO. ``We will follow
the system. We are loyal to the WTO,'' he told a news conference.
	   The Commissioner reiterated the view expressed by French Foreign
Minister Hubert Vedrine on Monday that if the US persists in
carrying out sanctions these could damage a transatlantic plan
designed to prevent trade disputes between the two sides.
	   ``I believe this dispute is not really about bananas. What has
been done has been done for political reasons, because of
Congressional pressure,'' Brittan said.
	   ``The fact that we have disputes with the US is quite normal.
What is important is that the settlement of the dispute should be
under multilateral trade rules,'' Brittan stressed.
	   Over the weekend, the United States warned of punitive action if
the 15-nation EU does not change its banana trade system, which
Washington claims unfairly favors imports from former European
colonies.
	   The United States says the EU has not done enough to fall in
line with a WTO verdict last year which ruled against the EU's
favorable treatment of a number of African, Caribbean, and Pacific
region countries.
	   The EU argues it approved new import regulations to comply with
WTO demands, but the United States and Central and South American
banana producers claim its banana import regime is still
discriminatory.
	   Brittan said Washington was due to issue a preliminary list of
EU products later Tuesday on which the United States could impose
sanctions to retaliate against the banana import regime.

Pro-government southern field commander defects to rebels
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) _ A field commander from a former southern
rebel faction that signed a peace accord with Khartoum has defected
to rebel ranks, a senior official was quoted Tuesday as saying.
	   Philip Pavin, a commander in the oil-rich state of Wehda, has
defected with 25 troops and joined the Sudan People's Liberation
Army, Ahmed Tahir Hamdoun, adviser to President Omar el-Bashir,
told the pro-government daily Alwan.
	   Pavin had been working under Paulino Matep, leader of one of the
south Sudan rebel factions that signed the peace accord with the
government in April 1997.
	   Hamdoun did not say when Pavin had defected or the reasons
behind his defection. Earlier, unofficial reports said Pavin had
walked away with 1,000 troops.
	   The statement by Hamdoun was the first official announcement of
a former southern rebel reneging on the peace agreement since
January's defection of Kerubino Kwanyin Bol to the SPLA.
	   Bol's defection led to the seizure by SPLA rebels of the
strategic town of Wau, 1,000 kilometers (625 miles) south of
Khartoum, which the government forces regained after a week of
fierce fighting.
	   The SPLA has been waging an insurrection since 1983, demanding
greater autonomy from the Islamic-dominated government for the
mainly Christian and animist south. More than 1.5 million Sudanese
have died in the fighting and consequent famines.

Ceremonies to open Australia's parliament
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ The second term of Prime Minister
John Howard's conservative government would be decent and open and
offer a fair go for all, Australia's parliament was told Tuesday as
it met for the first time since an Oct. 3 national election.
	   With political acrimony temporarily put aside, legislators from
Howard's conservative coalition and the Labor opposition mingled
and joked with each other while being officially sworn in as
members of Australia's 39th parliament.
	   In all, 147 members of the House of Representatives and 76
senators were sworn in, with 39 new faces enjoying their first
taste of parliamentary life and one new senator.
	   High Court Chief Justice Murray Gleeson officially opened
parliament, which was heralded by a military parade, a 19-gun
salute, an early morning church ceremony and bands.
	   The lawmakers took an oath of allegiance to the queen, but had a
choice of swearing the oath ``so help me God.''
	   Legislators were then presented to Governor-General Sir William
Deane, who made a speech penned in Howard's office that outlined
the government's agenda for the next term.
	   ``The government is committed to implementing the priorities for
its second term on the basis of its unequivocal commitment to the
Australian values of decency, openness, tolerance and a fair go for
all,'' said Deane, Queen Elizabeth II's representative in Australia
and the nation's titular head of state.
	   ``The government's priorities balance fairness and incentive.
... They are priorities centered on stronger families, stronger
workplaces and stronger communities.''
	   It may be the last time the governor-general addresses
parliament, with Australians likely to vote in a referendum on the
issue early in the new millennium.

China's president to visit Russia on Nov. 22
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Chinese President Jiang Zemin will arrive in
Moscow on Nov. 22 for a four-day visit that will include talks with
Boris Yeltsin and other senior Russian leaders, the Kremlin
announced on Tuesday.
	   Jiang will be in Moscow for a ``broad discussion on the
prospects of expanding and deepening the Russian-Chinese
partnership,'' Yeltsin's press service said in a statement released
to the media.
	   The summit will be Jiang's sixth with President Yeltsin.
	   During his visit, Jiang will also meet with Prime Minister
Yevgeny Primakov and other officials, and visit the Siberian city
of Novosibirsk on Nov. 24-25.
	   After decades of friction, relations between Moscow and Beijing
have improved dramatically in recent years. China has become a
major trading partner and a leading customer for Russia's
struggling defense industry.

U.S. business leaders affirm commitment to Southeast Asia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ U.S. corporate leaders visiting Singapore
Tuesday affirmed their commitment to doing business in Southeast
Asia, which is struggling through its most difficult economic
crisis in decades.
	   A delegation of seven business leaders met Singapore Prime
Minister Goh Chok Tong and Deputy Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong to
assess the local and regional economic situation, and discuss
measures to combat problems.
	   ``The countries in this region are vitally important to us, and
we are here to work on building confidence and getting investment
flowing again,'' said U.S.-ASEAN Business Council chairman George
David, who is also chairman and CEO of United Technologies Corp.
	   The Washington, D.C.-based private organization of about 300
U.S. companies heavily invested in the region promotes trade
between the United States and members of the Association of
Southeast Asian Nations.
	   ASEAN groups Brunei, Indonesia, Laos, Myanmar, Malaysia, the
Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam.
	   U.S. cooperation with Singapore in particular ``is vital to
regional economic recovery,'' said David, who also praised the
city-state for joining the United States in ``encouraging free
trade and investment and sound economic management.''
	   Singapore is the location of ``many of our member companies'
regional headquarters,'' noted council president Ernest Bower.
	   He said that in Southeast Asia, the island republic is the
United States' largest trading partner and top destination for U.S.
investment.
	   Trade between the two countries totaled dlrs 38 billion in 1997,
while American investment in Singapore reached dlrs 17.5 billion at
the end of last year, said David.
	   After concluding its three-country tour with a visit to Vietnam,
the delegation will attend the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation
forum in Kuala Lumpur Nov. 14-18, where it will continue lobbying
to remove tariffs and other barriers to overseas trade.

Taiwan to push for bailout plan at APEC, but won't go it alone
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ Taiwan will back a bailout of stricken
Asian economies at a regional meeting this month, but won't go it
alone, a top economic planner said Tuesday.
	   Taiwan hopes Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum members
will adopt a plan to guarantee bonds issued by countries suffering
from the Asian economic crisis, said Chiang Pin-kung, who will
represent President Lee Teng-hui at the APEC summit in Kuala
Lumpur.
	   Taiwan has pushed that proposal through a private APEC advisory
body, and officials say they relish the opportunity to build aid
ties with Southeast Asia.
	   But Taiwan needs to spread the risk and expense of such a
program, and won't attempt to guarantee bonds on its own, Chiang
said.
	   He said a minimum of three countries would be needed to back
what are being called collateralized bond obligations. Under the
program, countries less affected by the Asian crisis would join
with the Asian Development Bank and other lending institutions to
guarantee bonds issued by stricken countries to help them rebuild
their economies.
	   Chiang said the battering Asian economies have taken _ along
with the now questionable future of greater trade liberalization in
the region _ would dominate this year's APEC leaders' summit Nov.
18.
	   China's threats to boycott the APEC summit if Lee participates
compel Taiwan to send a stand-in, with Chiang being tapped this
year. China claims Taiwan as a breakaway province.
	   But Chiang said that, despite the slight, participation in APEC
was a boon for the island.
	   ``APEC is a rare opportunity for Taiwan to join in a regional
organization on an equal basis,'' Chiang said.
	   ``It increases our resources and lets our voice be heard.''

Iranian hard-liners demand expulsion of Palestinian diplomats
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Hard-line militants angry over the recent
Palestinian-Israeli peace deal called on the Iranian government
Tuesday to expel Palestinian diplomats from Tehran.
	   Some 30 members of the Ansar-e Hezbollah group protested for
three hours in front of the Foreign Ministry and presented an
official with a statement demanding the expulsion of Palestinian
representatives.
	   Ansar-e Hezbollah is a hard-line vigilante group that is
suspected of being used by hard-liners in Iran's hierarchy to
attack opponents.
	   The Palestinian Authority has two diplomats, including an
ambassador, in Tehran.
	   Following the 1979 Islamic Revolution, the Palestinians were
given the old Israeli Embassy as a site for their mission.
	   ``It is necessary to expel the representative of the mercenary
(Palestinian leader Yasser) Arafat as soon as possible. This
embassy should be handed over to the real representative of the
intifadeh,'' it said, referring to the six-year Palestinian
rebellion against Israeli rule in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
	   The uprising ended with a first peace accord in 1993.
	   The statement also called for preventing any Palestinian
Authority delegation from entering Iran.
	   ``It is necessary that preparations begin to expel Arafat from
the Organization of Islamic Conference and the United Nations,''
the statement added.
	   Since the revolution, Iran has opposed any Palestinian
settlement with Israel.
	   Arafat signed an accord with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu in late October, promising to crack down on Islamic
militants in exchange for a withdrawal of Israeli troops from 13
percent of the West Bank.
	   Last month, Iran's spiritual leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei
described Arafat as a ``an abject, treacherous person, a person who
is deeply immersed in the filth of selfishness and worldliness.''
	   Many Arab commentators and hard-line Palestinian groups have
criticized the deal as a sell-out of Palestinian aspirations.

Estrada welcomes meeting with Anwar's wife, but will still try to
</HEADLINE>
see Anwar

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ President Joseph Estrada said Tuesday
he welcomes a meeting with the wife of Anwar Ibrahim but still
hopes to see the jailed former Malaysian deputy prime minister if
given a chance during next week's Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation
summit.
	   ``That's good news,'' Estrada said in response to reports that
Anwar's wife, Azizah Wan Ismail, plans to call on him during the
Nov. 17-18 APEC meetings in Malaysia. ``At least, I'll know from
her what is really happening with her husband.''
	   But Estrada told reporters he will not insist on seeing Anwar if
Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad does not permit him.
	   ``They have their own rules and regulations and laws that we
cannot interfere,'' he said. ``But if I'll be allowed to see Anwar,
of course, I'll be thankful.''
	   On Monday, Philippine congressman Heherson Alvarez, who recently
returned from observing Anwar's trial in Malaysia, said Azizah told
him she plans to see Estrada.
	   Alvarez said the meeting was intended to prevent complications
that could arise if Estrada tries to see her jailed husband.
	   Estrada was the first foreign leader to publicly criticize the
jailing of Anwar, whom he considers a friend. He considered
boycotting the APEC meeting but has since said he will attend.
	   A meeting between Estrada and Mahathir in Kuala Lumpur has not
been announced.
	   Anwar was arrested Sept. 20, two weeks after he was fired by
Mahathir, setting off anti-government protests. Anwar has pleaded
innocent to 10 charges of corruption and illegal sex acts.
	   Anwar said the charges were fabricated because Mahathir
considers his popularity a threat to the prime minister's 17-year
rule.
	   Dozens of diplomats and representatives of international human
rights and jurist groups are sitting in on the trial, which is
expected to last well into next year. It has also created friction
between Malaysia and some of the 20 leaders who will take part in
the APEC summit.
	   In another development that could increase tensions between the
Philippines and Malaysia, Estrada's spokesman, Jerry Barican, said
Monday that the government has asked a commission to speed up a
study on the country's longstanding claim to the east Malaysian
state of Sabah.
	   Barican said the Philippines has not abandoned its claim to
Sabah but did not push it strongly during the terms of the past two
Philippine presidents.
	   He said the decision to revive the Sabah claim is a separate
issue that should not be confused with other recent events.

	   GLASGOW, Scotland (AP) _ Former Celtic great Kenny Dalglish,
together with pop star Jim Kerr, is planning a multi-million-pound
(dollar) takeover bid for the Scottish league champion.
	   Dalglish and Kerr, lead singer of Simple Minds, head a
consortium seeking to buy out current chairman and managing
director Fergus McCann, the British domestic news agency Press
Associated reported Tuesday.
	   Dalglish, former manager at Liverpool, Blackburn and Newcastle,
would make an emotional return to the Scottish club where he first
made his name.
	   Press Association said he would take on a role as
shareholder/owner but would also have a major interest on the
soccer side, with a manager or coach being brought in under him.
	   A large amount of money would be set aside for new transfers,
believed to be well above 10 million pounds (dlrs 1.67 million),
the report said.
	   Dalglish made 324 appearances for Celtic between 1968 and 1977,
and also set a national record of 102 appearances for Scotland. He
is currently out of soccer after being fired as Newcastle manager
earlier this season.
	   Dalglish has already been linked with the general manager's post
at Celtic, which became vacant following the resignation of Jock
Brown last Saturday.
	   Celtic won the Scottish League title last season after nine
years' of dominance by archrival Rangers. Celtic has struggled this
season following the departure of coach Wim Jansen.
	   The club hase been eliminated from the Champions Cup, the UEFA
Cup, the Scottish League Cup and lies third in the Scottish Premier
League _ seven points behind leaders Rangers.
	   McCann arrived at Celtic in 1994 with a ``five-year plan'' to
transform the club and has indicated that he is prepared to leave
at the end of that period _ next March. But there is no certainty
he will agree to sell out to Dalglish and Kerr.
	   McCann has publicly stated in the past that he intends to sell
his shares to a series of individual shareholders rather than a
consortium.

Report: Japanese customs officers seize 33,500 Viagra pills
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japanese customs officers have added a new drug to
their list of banned substances: Viagra. Inspectors at the
country's main international airport already have seized 33,500 of
the blue anti-impotence pills since May, a local report said
Tuesday.
	   The illegal supplies of Viagra were recovered in 12 cases
involving attempts by travelers to smuggle in more than the legal
limit of 30 pills allowed for personal use in Japan, Kyodo News
agency reported.
	   Customs officials were unavailable for comment after office
hours Tuesday.
	   Authorities have made several arrests of suspected Viagra
dealers over the past few months in an attempt to clamp down on a
thriving black market for the remedy, which is still undergoing
clinical testing in Japan.
	   The drug has been sold illegally in Japan for up to 6,000 yen
(dlrs 49) a pill, a huge markup over the roughly dlrs 10 per pill
charged by pharmacies in the United States.
	   In one of the reported smuggling cases, a South Korean woman was
found with 6,000 Viagra pills hidden in double-lined coat pockets
and a carry-on bag with a secret compartment.
	   Viagra is manufactured by Pfizer Inc. of the United States.

Foreign minister says threat of force `reckless'
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with comments from trade minister in grafs 9-11.
 &UR; By EILEEN ALT POWELL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraq's foreign minister said that the
American and British threat of a military strike was ``a reckless
act'' and called for a political solution to the dispute over U.N.
weapons inspections.
	   The minister, Mohammed Saeed al-Sahhaf, said in an interview
late Monday with Al-Jazeera Television that military action would
``lead to destabilizing the region.''
	   He called on the U.N. Security Council to respond to Iraq's
demand that a planned review of Iraq's compliance with U.N.
resolutions lead to the lifting of punishing sanctions, imposed
eight years ago after Iraq invaded Kuwait.
	   Al-Sahhaf said the Security Council should be ``given a genuine
opportunity _ free from all Anglo-Saxon pressures _ to conduct a
comprehensive review of the situation that is acceptable to all
parties.''
	   This, al-Sahhaf said, should ``lead us to start the process of
lifting the embargo on Iraq.''
	   ``As for those screaming and threatening the use of force, this
is nothing but a reckless act in the region,'' al-Sahhaf told the
Qatari television station.
	   In using the phrase ``Anglo-Saxon pressures,'' al-Sahhaf
referred to threats by the United States and Britain to use
military action after Iraq announced on Oct. 31 that it was halting
cooperation with the U.N. Special Commission.
	   UNSCOM is responsible for overseeing the destruction of Iraq's
chemical and biological weapons and long-range missiles. It must
certify Iraq has eliminated its lethal weapons before the Security
Council will lift the sanctions, which limit Iraq's sale of oil,
its economic mainstay.
	   Trade Minister Mohammed Mehdi Saleh told reporters on Tuesday
that ``Iraq would like to solve the crisis peacefully, but the
condition is to remove the hardships by lifting the sanctions.''
	   He repeated his earlier assertion that ``Iraq does not fear a
(military) strike by the United States.'' Saleh said America would
be the loser and Iraq the winner, implying that Baghdad would gain
Arab sympathy.
	   He made the comments at the close of the 10-day Baghdad
International Fair, the largest trade show here since the 1991 Gulf
War. Some 30 countries and more than 800 companies participated.
	   Iraq's latest limitations on UNSCOM came just one day after the
Security Council agreed to review the country's compliance with
U.N. resolutions. But it did not accede to Iraq's demand that this
be linked to lifting the sanctions.
	   Al-Sahhaf said, 11th graf pvs

TVM cyclists used doping substances, French newspaper says
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Six cyclists from the Dutch team TVM were found to
have used illegal doping substances during the Tour de France, a
French newspaper said Tuesday.
	   Following a July medical exam, four of six team members were
found to have used EPO, which increases oxygen to red blood cells,
and all of the cyclists had traces of other substances such as
corticoids, steroids and growth hormones, the newspaper Le Parisien
reported.
	   The results are part of a 200-page report from a hospital in
Albertville, on the Franco-Swiss border, where TVM team members
were taken for extensive medical checks during the Tour de France,
Le Parisien said.
	   The investigation into TVM began last March, when French customs
agents found about 100 doses of EPO in a team car.
	   The find was only made public after the outbreak of the Tour de
France scandal involving the Spanish team Festina, which was
disqualified after some of its riders admitted taking
performance-enhancing drugs.
	   A lawyer for TVM expressed surprise at Tuesday's report.
	   ``I am very surprised that these expert opinions, which should
be protected by judicial secrecy, have come to light through the
press,'' said Jacoba de Jongh, a lawyer representing four TVM
cyclists.
	   Cees Priem, TVM's team leader, has not been allowed to leave
France since July 23 when he and TVM team doctor Andrei Mikhailov
were arrested following the discovery of drugs in the team's hotel.
	   TVM cyclists later dropped out of the Tour, saying they did not
have the physical or mental strength to finish the race.

Lafontaine to meet with British, American and Italian counterparts
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ German Finance Minister Oskar Lafontaine
plans to discuss his push for some regulation of currency exchange
rates during meetings next week with his Italian, British and
American counterparts, the finance ministry said on Tuesday
	   Lafontaine has called for ``controlled flexibility'' in exchange
rates, meaning that countries with similar inflation rates should
agree to bands within which exchange rates can freely fluctuate.
	   The proposal is an indication of Lafontaine's desire to put in
place controls over international currency markets in an attempt to
avoid future financial crises such as recently hit Asia and Russia.
	   The proposal likely would involve bands linking the U.S. dollar,
the Japanese yen and Europe's future currency, the euro, to be
launched on Jan. 1.
	   Lafontaine will meet Italian Treasury Minister Carlo Azeglio
Ciampi in Rome on Nov. 19, before flying to London for a meeting
with U.K. Chancellor of the Exchequer Gordon Brown later that day,
the finance ministry said.
	   On Nov. 20, Lafontaine will be in Washington for meetings with
U.S. Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin, U.S. Federal Reserve chairman
Alan Greenspan and World Bank President James Wolfensohn.

Yeltsin rests in country house, will hold meetings later this week
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ President Boris Yeltsin remained out of public
view while resting at his country residence Tuesday, but he's
expected re-emerge later this week for a meeting with Japan's prime
minister.
	   Yeltsin, who returned to Moscow on Sunday from a week-long
vacation on the Black Sea, has made few public appearances
recently, fueling speculation about his health. His doctors ordered
him to take the vacation to recover from fatigue and high blood
pressure.
	   The 67-year-old Yeltsin has ceded many of his day-to-day duties
to Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov, who was in parliament on
Tuesday to discuss the government's economic recovery plan.
	   Yeltsin and his doctors insist his health problems are not
serious, and say he will serve out his term until the year 2000.
Opposition leaders have been calling for his resignation.
	   The president's health has not diminished his schedule in coming
weeks, his press service said. He will host Japanese Prime Minister
Keizo Obuchi on Thursday and Chinese President Jiang Zemin on Nov.
22.
	   He also will greet German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder,
President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro of Italy and Queen Beatrix of the
Netherlands this month as well.

Anwar issues warning to Mahathir during court recess
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With BC-Malaysia-Anwar Trial &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ During a break in his trial
Tuesday, former deputy prime minister Anwar Ibrahim issued a
warning to Malaysia's powerful leader, just a week before a Pacific
Rim summit meeting in Kuala Lumpur.
	   Anwar is on trial on sex and corruption charges, a setting that
is a far cry from his previous post just behind Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad. The trial stems in part from a power clash
between the two men.
	   During a recess in Tuesday's proceedings, Anwar was asked his
reaction to the decision by U.S. President Bill Clinton and
Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien to snub private talks with
Mahathir during the trade summit Nov. 17-18.
	   ``Mahathir should consider it (the snub) serious. Even foreign
leaders reject him,'' the 51-year-old Anwar told a small group of
reporters.
	   As court bailiffs moved in to silence him, Anwar hastily added:
``Foreign leaders can no longer tolerate him any more. He's
becoming recalcitrant.''
	   The word ``recalcitrant'' carries strong overtones in Malaysia,
since it's the same word the Australian leadership used in
criticizing Mahathir several years ago.
	   Anwar also told reporters that the Malaysian people themselves
have rejected Mahathir, who at age 72 is Asia's longest-serving
leader.
	   Anwar was arrested Sept. 20, two weeks after he was fired by
Mahathir. The arrest set off a wave of protests by Anwar supporters
in Kuala Lumpur.
	   Anwar has pleaded innocent to 10 charges of corruption and
illegal sex acts. He is being held in prison during the trial,
which will stretch well into next year.
	   Clinton, Chretien and leaders from 18 other countries will hold
a summit meeting of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation group
next week.

Palestinians protest confiscation of land to build road
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By NASSER SHIYOUKHI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer-

<TEXT>
	   AL KHADER, West Bank (AP) _ Dozens of Palestinians on Tuesday
blocked an Israeli bulldozer trying to pave a bypass road for
Jewish settlers for which 40 acres of Arab land were confiscated.
	   About seventy protesters stood in the bulldozer's path while 30
Israeli soldiers tried to negotiate a solution.
	   After several hours, the Israelis decided to halt work on the
road for one week in order to give sides time to resolve the
dispute in court.
	   The new road would serve as both the main entrance to the Jewish
settlement of Efrat and as a link to the area's main highway for a
nearby Arab village, said Lt. Peter Lerner, spokesman for the
Israeli military government in the West Bank.
	   Lerner said that its construction would include the confiscation
of about 150 dunams (40 acres) of land.
	   Jamila Sallah, 50, wearing a traditional Palestinian black dress
with colored embroidery, stood near the bulldozer and lamented the
pending paving of the road.
	   ``They are stealing my land in front of my eyes and I can't do
anything about it. But I will stand in front of the bulldozer to
stop it, I won't let it pass,'' said an anguished Sallah, ``Only
over my dead body would it pass. This is all that I have.''
	   Salah Tamari, a member of the Palestinian legislative council,
said the road paving violated the Israeli-Palestinian peace
agreement signed last month in Washington.
	   As part of the agreement, both sides undertook not to take
unilateral steps that would prejudice the outcome of future talks
on a permanent peace agreement.
	   Tamari hailed the decision to bring the issue to court a
victory.
	   ``It is a retreat from their (the Israeli) position and it is an
accomplishment for the Palestinians.''

BASF posts nearly 14 percent gains in net profit in first nine
</HEADLINE>
months of year &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ Displaying resilience to global
economic woes, the German chemicals company BASF announced a 13.8
percent gain in net profits to 2.58 billion marks (dlrs 1.56
billion) for the first nine months of the year.
	   But the company warned that its profit growth will decline in
the fourth quarter, and that it expects to post only a ``slight''
pretax profit for 1998.
	   Net profit in the third quarter rose 13.2 percent despite a 7.5
percent drop in sales to 12.6 billion marks (dlrs 7.6 billion),
which the company blamed on declining prices.
	   Long forecast by analysts, the price decline in base chemicals,
advantageous when a company purchases raw materials, has started to
impact sales prices as well. In addition, the recent appreciation
of the mark against the dollar in the third quarter has caused
BASF's sales in North America to mostly stagnate in mark terms.
	   In Asia, BASF particularly noted declining prices in Indonesia,
Thailand and Singapore.
	   BASF stressed that lower extraordinary charges and improvements
in financial income will help balance declining sales by the end of
the year.

</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With Mitch

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - European Union Humanitarian Aid
Commissioner Emma Bonino will visit Nicaragua, Honduras, Guatemala
and El Salvador to assess the damage caused by Hurricane Mitch,
officials said Tuesday.
	   Her spokesman Pietro Petrucci said Bonino will leave Saturday
for her first stop, Nicaragua. He gave no details but said she will
spend ``less than a week'' traveling to the region devastated by
torrential rains and mudslides.
	   At least 10,000 people are reported dead after Mitch's deadly
passage across Central America. Tens of thousands of others are
homeless and face hunger after Mitch wiped entire villages off the
map and ruined countless crops.
	   The extent of the damage has set the region back years. On
Monday, EU foreign ministers considered debt relief as a possible
measure to help the stricken Central American countries with
rebuilding efforts.
	   The ministers asked the EU Commission to prepare a series of
proposals on further EU aid to the region. The Commission is
expected to come up with a report by Nov. 30, in time for a meeting
of EU development ministers.
	   Petrucci listed the amount of aid pledged so far for Central
America:
	   - the 15 individual EU countries have pledged around 71 million
ecu (dlrs 85 million).
	   - the Commission has pledged a total 30.8 million ecu (dlrs 37
million). This includes 9.8 million ecu (dlrs 11.8 million) from
the Commission's humanitarian office, Echo; 13 million ecu (dlrs
15.6 million) in food aid from the Commission's development office,
and 8 million ecu (dlrs 9.6 million) specifically aimed at
reconstruction efforts.

UN agency says cereal stocks in Russia could reach critically low
</HEADLINE>
levels

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Remote areas in Russia could face food shortages in
the coming months due to a sharp decline in the output of wheat,
barley, potatoes and other crops, a U.N. agency said Tuesday.
	   The Rome-based Food and Agriculture Agency estimated that 1998
cereal output will be down 43 percent from 1997 and that stocks
will fall to a ``critically low level'' if consumption is
maintained at current levels.
	   Russia's economic crisis, combined with drought and falling food
imports, have raised concerns about the country's food supplies
heading into the winter. The agency blamed the drop in crop
production on the hot and dry weather.
	   In a report compiled after a mission to Russia last month, the
agency said it did not expect a national food shortage but warned
that some of the more isolated regions could run out of food.
	   Remote areas in the north and far east ``face the risk of
erratic food supplies and high prices,'' the report said.
	   Although no serious food shortages have been reported, the
Russian government wants to ensure that plenty is on hand. On
Tuesday it reached a tentative agreement to receive food aid from
the European Union just days after completing a similar deal with
the United States.

<TEXT>
	   DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) _ A Bangladeshi man drowned
when he jumped into a well to retrieve 20 dirhams (dlrs 5) that
accidentally fell into the water, the Gulf News reported Tuesday.
	   It said Abdul Ahad drowned Monday in a well in the emirate of
Fujairah, one of the seven that make up the United Arab Emirates.
	   A fellow national, Saleem Abdul Hai, went in to the well to
rescue Ahad but was too late, the paper said. ``I found him dead. I
could not get out of the well myself because I had injured
myself,'' it quoted Abdul Hai as saying.
	   The woman who owned the property where the well is located
called authorities to rescue the two men. Abdul Hai was taken to a
hospital, the paper said, without giving other details.
	   More than three quarters of the Emirates' population of 2.4
million are foreigners. Many are poor laborers from the Indian
subcontinent.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia has reached a tentative agreement on food
aid with the European Union just days after completing a similar
deal with the United States, news reports said Tuesday.
	   Under the plan, Russia would purchase food worth 400 million
European currency units (dlrs 480 million) and receive E.U.
humanitarian aid worth 10 million to 12 million ecus (dlrs 12 to 14
million), Deputy Prime Minister Gennady Kulik said, according to
Russian news agencies.
	   The two sides will meet shortly to finalize the deal, he said.
EU officials said Monday that a deal was in the works, but have not
yet announced any agreement.
	   The food purchased by the Russian government would be sold on
the Russian market with the profits spent on government social
programs, Kulik said. Russia wants the humanitarian aid to be
targeted primarily toward its frigid northern regions, he said.
	   The report comes just four days after Russia and the United
States signed a dlrs 625 million agreement for 3.1 million tons of
U.S. food aid, including wheat, corn, pork and beef.
	   Russia's economic crisis, combined with drought and falling food
imports, have raised concerns about the country's food supplies
heading into the winter. No serious food shortages have been
reported, but the government wants to ensure that plenty is on
hand.
	   Meanwhile, Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov rounded up several of
his top Cabinet ministers and headed to parliament in a bid to win
broad support for his economic recovery program.
	   The session was closed, but lawmakers said discussions focused
on next year's budget.
	   Russia's economic crisis hit almost three months ago, and
Primakov's government has moved slowly to put together a response.
The prime minister has sought to stabilize the shrinking economy
and has not taken any drastic steps.
	   President Boris Yeltsin has receded into the background since
the crisis hit and has transferred control over the economy to
Primakov, but Kremlin aides insist that the president would step in
if conditions grew worse.
	   ``If the president thinks that the government's economic
decisions have a tinge of fatal error, he will interfere,''
Yeltsin's deputy chief of staff, Oleg Sysuyev, said in an interview
published Tuesday with the Moskovsky Komsomolets newspaper.
	   Meanwhile, Russia's Finance Minister Mikhail Zadornov said
Tuesday that the government would print up to 25 billion rubles
(dlrs 1.7 billion) before the end of the year to cover the budget
deficit. The government had earlier insisted that no more than 15
billion rubles (dlrs 1 billion) would be printed.

Dutch divided on how best to switch to the euro
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ A Dutch forum planning the
introduction of the single European currency is split over whether
to phase in the euro over a month or replace the guilder in a
single-day switch.
	   The National Forum for the Introduction of the Euro sent a
proposal to parliament Tuesday to ease the euro into Dutch wallets
over a four-week period at the beginning of 2002.
	   The forum is made up of representatives from major trade unions,
the finance and economics ministries, Dutch companies and the
Amsterdam stock exchange.
	   But representatives of retailers and small businesses boycotted
the meeting at which the proposal was drawn up because of remarks
from Nout Wellink, the president of the Dutch Central Bank.
	   Wellink believes it is unrealistic for the new currency to be
introduced nationally in just one day. Commercial banks also have
expressed doubts that a so-called ``big bang'' introduction would
be possible.
	   But retailers are firm supporters of the one-day implementation.
An organization representing small businesses has estimated that
adapting machinery to cope with the two currencies side-by-side for
four weeks will cost retailers about 1 billion guilders (dlrs 535
million).
	   Although the new currency official debuts on Jan. 1, 1999, euro
coins and notes will come into circulation in the 11 euro-zone
nations between Jan. 1, 2002 and June 30, 2002.
	   Individual countries can decide independently how long they will
take to introduce the euro.

	   LAHORE, Pakistan (AP) _ Adam Gilchrist and Ricky Ponting each
hit centuries and combined for a 193-run second-wicket partnership
to lead Australia to a six-wicket victory over Pakistan and a sweep
of their three-match series.
	   Ijaz Ahmed and Yousaf Youhana both hammered centuries to get
Pakistan out to a total of 315 for eight but Gilchrist hit 103 and
Ponting added an unbeaten 124 to power Australia to 316 for four in
48.5 overs.
	   ``We were beaten by a truly professional side,'' Pakistan
captain Aamir Sohail said. ``Three hundred and fifteen was a big
total, but in the end the Australians, Ponting and Gilchrist,
batted with remarkable ease and that cost us the match.''
	   Australian captain Steve Waugh was delighted with the victory.
	   ``Obviously beating any team in the world while chasing such a
huge total is a big thing,'' he said. ``Gilchrist and Ponting
batted fantastically and eventually guided us home.''
	   Gilchrist cracked a dozen boundaries in his third one-day
century. He was eventually stumped off a wide delivery by Sohail,
but not before putting Australia firmly on the road to victory at
218 for two in the 34th over.
	   Darren Lehmann was out for eight off a contentious caught behind
decision off Salim Malik. Waugh added 69 runs for the fourth wicket
with Ponting. Waugh was bowled by Saqlain Mushtaq in the 47th over
with Australia only 10 runs from a victor..
	   Man of the Match Ponting achieved his fifth one-day
international hundred off 129 balls that featured 10 fours.
	   Wasim Akram was the most impressive of Pakistan's bowlers with
the wicket of Mark Waugh, who was trapped leg before early in
Australia's innings.
	   Earlier, Ahmed and Youhana hammered aggressive centuries to help
Pakistan post its highest one-day total of 315 for eight. It beat
the previous Pakistan best of 286 for seven made at Trent Bridge
during a World Cup match in 1979.
	   They put on 162 for the fourth wicket after Pakistan lost three
wickets for 73. Ahmed was bowled by left-arm spinner Darren Lehmann
_ one of eight bowlers used by Steve Waugh. Ahmed made 111 off 109
balls and hit a dozen fours and a six.
	   Salim Malik's poor series continued when he was run out for two
off a TV replay decision while Asif Mahmood, who made his debut in
Peshawar, was dismissed for zero by Glenn McGrath.
	   Soon after making his century, Youhanna hit Brendon Julian's low
full toss straight to Mark Waugh at mid off.
	   Shahid Afridi, demoted late in the order cracked a quick 40 off
26 balls which featured a six over extra cover off Brendon Julian.

Arafat accuses Netanyahu of wasting time over peace accord
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ANN S. KIM &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   RAMALLAH, West Bank (AP) _ Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat on
Tuesday accused Israel of willfully wasting time in implementing
the land-for-security agreement with the Palestinians.
	   A senior Palestinian negotiator said the Palestinians might stop
fulfilling their commitments under the accord if Israel's Cabinet
did not ratify the U.S.-brokered agreement in the next few days.
	   A test of the Palestinians' intention could come Nov. 21 when
the 110-member Palestinian Central Council is to take a step toward
revoking provisions in the PLO founding charter calling for
Israel's destruction.
	   Arafat did not refer Tuesday to holding up implementation, but
sharply criticized Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu who
four times in the past two weeks postponed or broke off Cabinet
sessions during which the accord was to be ratified.
	   ``We expect that Netanyahu will waste a lot of time and he's not
going to implement the agreement honestly and quickly at all,''
Arafat said after meeting with the Duke of Kent.
	   Palestinian negotiator Hassan Asfour said that in response to
the delays by Israel, the Palestinians are considering ``whether to
put on hold its implementation of their commitments.''
	   ``Implementation cannot be unilateral. It must be mutual and
reciprocal,'' Asfour told reporters.
	   As part of the 12-week accord, Israel is to withdraw from 13
percent of the West Bank, in exchange for tougher Palestinian
measures against Islamic militants.
	   U.S. officials have said the clock began ticking on Nov. 2, or
10 days after the Oct. 23 signing of the agreement at the White
House.
	   In a first step, the Palestinians submitted a detailed
anti-terror plan. In a second stage on Oct. 6, the PLO Executive
Committee reaffirmed a letter by Arafat to U.S. President Bill
Clinton in which the Palestinian leader listed the clauses of the
PLO charter that were no longer valid.
	   In exchange, Israel was to withdraw from 2 percent of the West
Bank on Nov. 16, but Netanyahu adviser David Bar-Illan said this
week that it was likely the pullback would be delayed.
	   Netanyahu has said he cannot implement the agreement until it
has been ratified by the Cabinet and Israel's parliament. Netanyahu
has not decided whether to convene the ministers this week.

Moenchengladbach fires coach after humiliating defeats
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOENCHENGLADBACH, Germany (AP) _ After conceding 15 goals in the
last two games, the Bundesliga club Borussia Moenchengladbach fired
coach Friedel Rausch on Tuesday.
	   Once one of the most glorious Bundesliga clubs with five
national titles and two UEFA Cup crowns in the 1970s,
Moenchengladbach is languishing at the bottom of the league and
faces an uphill battle to avoid relegation.
	   In its last two games, Moenchengladbach was crushed 8-2 by Bayer
Leverkusen and 7-1 by Wolfsburg.
	   Rausch, 58, was hired in April and under his guidance the club
escaped demotion in the final round last season.
	   So far this season, Moenchengladbach has won one and lost eight
of 11 games, conceding 34 goals, by far the worst defensive record
in the 18-team league.
	   When it dominated the Bundesliga 20 years ago with its
flamboyant, attacking style, Moenchengladbach produced such stars
as Guenter Netzer, Rainer Bonhof, Jupp Heynckes and Berti Vogts,
who resigned as national team coach after this summer's World Cup.
	   Bonhof, who worked as Vogts' assistant and now is in charge of
Germany's junior team, is expected to be named Rausch's successor
later Tuesday.

Eritrea and Sudan sign memorandum of understanding in Qatar
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DOHA, Qatar (AP) _ The foreign ministers of Eritrea and Sudan on
Tuesday signed a memorandum of understanding pledging to try to
peacefully settle their dispute over allegations of Eritrean
military incursions into Sudan.
	   The signing came after Qatari Foreign Minister Sheik Hamad bin
Jassim bin Jabor al Thani mediated talks between the two ministers.
Al Thani ``expressed deep satisfaction with this positive step,''
said a Qatari official who announced the agreement.
	   Haile Woldensae of Eritrea and Mustafa Osman Ismail signed an
agreement ``to seek means of setting up meetings between the two
sides to resolve their differences,'' said the official, speaking
on condition of anonymity.
	   The two African ministers held talks at the foreign ministry
Monday and Tuesday. Ismail of Sudan left after signing the
agreement. Woldensae was expected to leave later Tuesday.
	   Qatar offered to mediate between the two neighbors when its
leader Sheik Hamad bin Khalifa al Thani visited Sudan in June.
	   Sudan, fighting separatists in the south, has accused Eritrea of
aiding Sudanese opposition groups and of sending troops to fight
alongside Sudanese rebels. Eritrea has denied the charges.
	   Sudanese rebels have been fighting since 1983 for greater
autonomy for the Christians and animists in the south from the
Islamic north. More than 1.5 million people have died in the war
and related famines.

Princess Diana fund giving no money for mine clearance
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Princess Diana's memorial fund said Tuesday it
will give 1 million pounds (dlrs 1.7 million) to help victims of
landmines but nothing to assist her cause of removing mines around
the globe.
	   The Princess of Wales Memorial Fund said it decided the money
available was a tiny fraction of the cost for removing mines
worldwide, and that the funds were best used for victims.
	   Diana highlighted her concern about the issue on a highly
publicized walk through a minefield in Angola in February 1997,
seven months before her death.
	   The fund's decision dismayed one major group involved in
clearance.
	   ``Landmine clearance was something with which Diana was very
clearly involved and because of that people expect we are receiving
plentiful donations from the fund,'' said Lou McGrath, director of
the Mines Advisory Group.
	   ``But, as we have heard today, the opposite is the case and we
face the ludicrous situation of the Diana memorial fund doing
nothing to help a cause to which she gave a very clear and very
important commitment.''
	   McGrath added that fundraising had been hampered by a public
perception that mine clearance work was being supported by the
memorial fund.

Japanese stars beat Major League squad 6-2
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   FUKUOKA, Japan (AP) _ Hideki Matsui hit a two-run home run in
the three-run first inning as Japan's all-stars rebounded from two
losses and beat a team of U.S. Major League stars 6-2 Tuesday.
	   Another Matsui, Kazuo, scored one run on a wild throw after
being hit by a pitch, stealing second and heading for third. Then
he drove in two more with a triple.
	   The major leaguers had opened their Japan visit with three
straight victories _ 4-1 over the Central League's third-place
Yomiuri Giants, and then 8-1 and 10-7 in the first two games of a
seven-game series against the Japanese all-stars.
	   They also scored the first run Tuesday, on a sacrifice fly by
Sammy Sosa in the top of the first inning after a double by Andruw
Jones of the Atlanta Braves and a single by Nomar Garciaparra of
the Boston Red Sox. Sosa struck out and grounded out in his later
at-bats.
	   But in the bottom of the inning, Japan's leading hitter, Ichiro
Suzuki of the Orix BlueWave, singled home the tying run off
American starter Al Leiter of the New York Mets.
	   Then Hideki Matsui of the Giants, who led the Central League
with 34 homers this season, put Japan ahead 3-1 with his first
homer of the series, before 48,000 spectators at Fukuoka Dome in
southern Japan. He was named the game's Most Valuable Player.
	   Kazuo Matsui of the Pacific League champion Seibu Lions made it
4-1 in the fifth after being hit by a pitch by Billy Wagner of the
Houston Astros. He stole second, and then catcher Javy Lopez of the
Atlanta Braves threw wild when he set out to steal third.
	   The major leaguers closed the gap to 4-2 in the sixth.
Garciaparra singled off reliever Satoru Komiyama of the Fukuoka
Daiei Hawks and moved to third on a double by Carlos Delgado of the
Toronto Blue Jays.
	   Sosa flied out to second, but B.J. Surhoff of the Baltimore
Orioles brought in Garciaparra with a grounder to shortstop. Greg
Vaughn of the San Diego Padres grounded out.
	   Komiyama, who had an 11-12 record and a 3.57 earned run average
in the 1998 regular season, gave up three hits over three innings
and at one point struck out four batters in a row.
	   Japan added two runs in the bottom of the sixth on Kazuo
Matsui's triple off Ugueth Urbina of the Montreal Expos.
	   Game 4 in the all-stars series is scheduled Wednesday at Osaka
Dome in western Japan.
	   The Major Leagues last sent an all-star team to Japan in 1996,
and it came out ahead 4-2-2 in the series.

Arafat invites Queen Elizabeth II for 2000 celebrations
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   RAMALLAH, West Bank (AP) _ Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat on
Tuesday invited Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip to visit the
Palestinian areas in honor of the millennium.
	   Arafat delivered the invitation during a meeting with the Duke
of Kent, a cousin of the queen, who is on a three-day trade mission
to Israel and the autonomous Palestinian areas.
	   Arafat said in his halting English that he asked the duke to
``make a favor, to carry my best regards and thanks from my heart
to her majesty.''
	   The Palestinian leader said he has invited the queen and her
husband ``for the 2000 celebrations'' in the Holy Land. The
Palestinians hope to attract a large number of tourists to the
festivities, especially in Palestinian-run Bethlehem, the
traditional birthplace of Jesus.
	   The duke said that he knew of no plans by the queen to visit.

Air France CEO sees stock sale early next year
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Air France's chairman said Tuesday he expects the
government to sell a minority stake in the state-run airline in
January or February
	   ``From Air France's perspective we would like it to occur as
soon as possible ... in the beginning of next year,'' Air France
Chairman and Chief Executive Jean-Cyril Spinetta told a news
conference.
	   The French government in February said it would sell about 20
percent of the airline on the stock market. Observers valued that
stake at between 3 billion francs (dlrs 535 million) and 5 billion
francs (dlrs 892 million).
	   The sale was delayed by a pilots' strike in early June and by
negotiations over a final accord with the pilots, concluded in
October.
	   Under the recent agreement with pilots, Air France will sell up
to 12 percent of the company to pilots in exchange for salary
freezes and education cost repayments.
	   An Air France share flotation in January or February would fall
nicely between the sale of a second tranche of stock in France
Telecom, which will be complete in early December, and the sale of
a majority of the troubled bank Credit Lyonnais SA, scheduled to
take place in April.

Eritrea and Sudan sign memorandum of understanding in Qatar
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DOHA, Qatar (AP) _ The foreign ministers of Eritrea and Sudan on
Tuesday signed a memorandum of understanding pledging to try to
peacefully settle their dispute over allegations of Eritrean
military incursions into Sudan.
	   The signing came after Qatari Foreign Minister Sheik Hamad bin
Jassim bin Jabor al Thani mediated talks between the two ministers.
Al Thani ``expressed deep satisfaction with this positive step,''
said a Qatari official who announced the agreement.
	   Haile Woldensae of Eritrea and Mustafa Osman Ismail signed an
agreement ``to seek means of setting up meetings between the two
sides to resolve their differences,'' said the official, speaking
on condition of anonymity.
	   The two African ministers held talks at the foreign ministry
Monday and Tuesday. Ismail of Sudan left after signing the
agreement. Woldensae was expected to leave later Tuesday.
	   Qatar offered to mediate between the two neighbors when its
leader Sheik Hamad bin Khalifa al Thani visited Sudan in June.
	   Sudan, fighting separatists in the south, has accused Eritrea of
aiding Sudanese opposition groups and of sending troops to fight
alongside Sudanese rebels. Eritrea has denied the charges.
	   Sudanese rebels have been fighting since 1983 for greater
autonomy for the Christians and animists in the south from the
Islamic north. More than 1.5 million people have died in the war
and related famines.

United States, India end discussions on nuclear control regimes
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ The United States Tuesday praised India
_ one of the world's two newest nuclear-armed states _ for its
resolve to step up controls on selling its nuclear know-how to
others.
	   A U.S. delegation was in New Delhi for two days discussing
export controls, and was to hold matching discussions with the
other new nuclear power, Pakistan, on Wednesday.
	   ``The United States appreciates India's commitment for
nonproliferation, reflected in its effective system of export
controls, and applauds India's support for enhancing its export
control system,'' said a statement released by the U.S. Embassy.
	   The statement welcomed the opportunity to share ``experience and
insights in this vital area.''
	   The meeting followed an announcement in Washington that
President Bill Clinton will lift some of the economic sanctions
imposed against India and Pakistan after they detonated nuclear
devices in May. The administration cited progress on enlisting the
support of the two countries in nonproliferation issues.
	   The U.S. delegation, headed by Deputy Assistant Secretary of
State John Barker, was looking at the controls India has adopted to
ensure its nuclear know-how and equipment is not given to third
countries.

Germany to outlaw kickbacks to foreign officials
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Germany is set to outlaw tax deductions for
bribes paid to foreign officials, falling in line with a U.S.-led
drive to fight corruption and promote fair competition.
	   The change is part of proposed tax reforms presented Monday by
the new center-left government of Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder.
Parliament is expected to approve the measure before the end of the
year.
	   Currently, kickbacks paid by German companies abroad or at home
to win contracts are tax deductible as legitimate business expenses
unless the person who made the payout is found out and convicted of
bribery. In practice, that rarely happens.
	   The new rule would apply only to bribes to foreign public
officials, not to private individuals. But the change helps combat
corruption even with its limited scope, the government says.
	   Kickbacks inside Germany would also no longer be deductible.
	   The crackdown follows an agreement signed by Germany and other
major industrial nations in Paris last December to help root out
bribery in international business. The United States was a driving
force behind several years of tough negotiations over the pact.

Search continues for abducted foreigners after Angolan mine attack

<TEXT>
	   LUANDA, Angola (AP) _ Troops and police Tuesday combed the
jungle of northeast Angola for four foreign workers abducted by
gunmen during an attack on a Canadian diamond mine.
	   The missing workers included one Briton, according to the
British Embassy which declined to identify the man. The
nationalities of the other three men were not immediately
available.
	   Gunmen attacked the mine at Yetwene, a remote mining village
about 600 kilometers (370 miles) east of the capital Luanda, before
dawn Sunday, killing five employees and wounding 18 others,
according to Vancouver-based DiamondWorks Ltd..
	   Diplomats in Luanda identified the dead as Britons Alan Thomas,
49, and David Boutle, 26, and Portuguese-born South African Antonio
Vasconcelos. The identity of the other two dead, both Angolans, was
not made known.
	   The Luanda spokesman for Canada's Branch Energy, which owns
DiamondWorks, said the company's chief executive officer Bruce
Walsham was due to arrive in the Angolan capital late Tuesday.
	   Walsham would hold talks with officials and visit the Yetwene
mine, Gaspar Cardoso said.
	   A spokesman for the South African Embassy said the army and
police units arrived at the scene shortly after the attack, carried
out by an unknown number of gunmen.
	   ``The security forces cleaned out the area,'' Ebrahim Edreis
said. ``But the situation in the north is very tense,'' he added.
	   The diamond-rich northeast has been the scene of renewed clashes
in recent months between government forces and the remnants of the
former rebel group UNITA's guerrilla army.
	   A United Nations-brokered peace pact signed four years ago ended
two decades of civil war, but lingering hostility between the
former foes has prevented its full implementation.
	   Gangs of armed bandits, made up mostly of demobilized soldiers,
also roam the countryside of the vast southwest African nation and
have attacked outlying towns.

Arafat accuses Netanyahu of wasting time over peace accord
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: CORRECTS date to Nov. 6, sted Oct. 6, in 10th graf &QL; 
 &UR; By ANN S. KIM &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   RAMALLAH, West Bank (AP) _ Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat on
Tuesday accused Israel of willfully wasting time in implementing
the land-for-security agreement with the Palestinians.
	   A senior Palestinian negotiator said the Palestinians might stop
fulfilling their commitments under the accord if Israel's Cabinet
did not ratify the U.S.-brokered agreement in the next few days.
	   A test of the Palestinians' intention could come Nov. 21 when
the 110-member Palestinian Central Council is to take a step toward
revoking provisions in the PLO founding charter calling for
Israel's destruction.
	   Arafat did not refer Tuesday to holding up implementation, but
sharply criticized Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu who
four times in the past two weeks postponed or broke off Cabinet
sessions during which the accord was to be ratified.
	   ``We expect that Netanyahu will waste a lot of time and he's not
going to implement the agreement honestly and quickly at all,''
Arafat said after meeting with the Duke of Kent.
	   Palestinian negotiator Hassan Asfour said that in response to
the delays by Israel, the Palestinians are considering ``whether to
put on hold its implementation of their commitments.''
	   ``Implementation cannot be unilateral. It must be mutual and
reciprocal,'' Asfour told reporters.
	   As part of the 12-week accord, Israel is to withdraw from 13
percent of the West Bank, in exchange for tougher Palestinian
measures against Islamic militants.
	   U.S. officials have said the clock began ticking on Nov. 2, or
10 days after the Oct. 23 signing of the agreement at the White
House.
	   In a first step, the Palestinians submitted a detailed
anti-terror plan. In a second stage on Nov. 6, the PLO Executive
Committee reaffirmed a letter by Arafat to U.S. President Bill
Clinton in which the Palestinian leader listed the clauses of the
PLO charter that were no longer valid.

Jimenez wins shot of year for winning chip
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   VIRGINIA WATER, England (AP) _ Spain's Miguel Angel Jimenez has
been voted the winner of the PGA European Tour's 1998 Shot of the
Year award for the chip that clinched his victory at the Trophee
Lancome in September.
	   Jimenez went into the final round of the tournament at
Saint-Nom-La-Breteche, France, with a two-stroke lead.
	   He missed the green with his tee shot at the par-3, 209-yard
18th hole, with the ball rolling under the grandstand. He needed to
go to the dropping zone.
	   With the ball now sitting in two-inch semi-rough, Jimenez faced
a chip over a ridge and downhill to the hole.
	   He made perfect contact and the ball ran into the hole for a
birdie two and a two-stroke victory.

Thai woman jumps to death after boyfriend leaves

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ A Thai woman fell to her death from a
five-story building after police trying to talk her out of suicide
made a sudden, failed bid to grab and rescue her.
	   Police in Hat Yat, 950 kilometers (590 miles) south of Bangkok,
came under criticism Tuesday for the botched rescue, which was seen
by millions of Thais on television.
	   Four more people in and around Bangkok, the capital, were
reported to have threatened to jump off buildings Tuesday in the
wake of the well-publicized incident. One of them did jump, and
died.
	   In the case of the 25-year-old woman, Sripraphai Cheoyphiew, no
nets were spread during the five-hour standoff Monday and no
ambulance had been placed on standby, only a pickup truck run by a
local charity that normally collects bodies from car accidents.
Police said they had no such rescue equipment.
	   Sripraphai was reportedly depressed after her Malaysian
boyfriend left her. She stood on the roof of her building as a
plainclothes officer negotiated with her. At one point, he tried to
grab her. In the video, she appeared startled and fell off the
ledge.
	   The officer clutched a handful of her skirt and held on for
about five seconds as she scrambled to find a handhold on the
building wall. But the skirt tore away and she fell to the ground.
	   She died two hours later from internal bleeding.
	   In Bangkok and the nearby province of Samut Prakarn, four people
threatened to jump to their deaths Tuesday, the television network
ITV reported. Three were talked out of it, but one went ahead and
jumped, killing himself, the report said. The reasons for their
actions were not stated.
	   Experts interviewed on TV said they were afraid that the
high-profile media coverage of the attempts might encourage other
people to try suicide.

Constitutional Court rejects journalist's defense argument
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUWAIT (AP) _ The Constitutional Court rejected Tuesday a
defense argument raised by lawyers for a Kuwaiti editor sentenced
to prison for publishing a joke deemed insulting to Islam.
	   The attorneys for Mohammad al-Saqar, editor of the independent
daily Al-Qabas, claimed that the 1961 publications law under which
he was convicted contradicts the constitution.
	   In the joke printed in Al-Qabas, a teacher asks his students:
``Why did God kick Adman and Eve out of heaven?'' A student
answers: ``Because they hadn't paid the rent.''
	   The case will now go back to the Appeals Court that will uphold
or overturn a June 24 ruling by the Court of First Instance
sentencing al-Saqar to six months in jail.
	   ``We were astonished by the ruling of the Constitutional
Court,'' attorney and human rights activist, Ali al-Baghli, told
The Associated Press. An explanation of the ruling was not
available.
	   He insisted the law ``presumed guilt'' by stipulating an
editor-in-chief is responsible for everything published in the
newspaper. The 1962 constitution, however, says individuals cannot
be penalized for the wrongdoing of others.
	   Al-Saqar was taken to court by the Information Ministry after
Muslim fundamentalist lawmakers objected to the joke that was
contributed by an Egyptian from Cairo who was sentenced in absentia
to six months in jail.

Supreme Defense Council has approved the deal for U.S. guns
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUWAIT (AP) _ Deputy Prime Minister Sheik Sabah al-Ahmed
al-Sabah confirmed to Parliament Tuesday that Kuwait has decided to
buy U.S. howitzers in a controversial deal that would cost around
dlrs 496 million.
	   But 16 lawmakers who oppose the purchase, made a non-binding
recommendation to the government to halt the purchase until the
Audit Bureau, Kuwait's financial watchdog, decides it was free of
any irregularities.
	   Sheik Sabah, who also serves as minister of foreign affairs,
told the 50-seat National Assembly the deal has been approved by
the Supreme Defense Council. He did not say if a contract has been
signed.
	   No details of the deal have been officially announced here.
However, the Pentagon had previously said Kuwait was planning to
buy 48 Paladin M-109 self-artillery pieces. The American Ambassador
James Larocco said Saturday the 155mm guns will be ``updated to
respond to (Kuwait's) unique requirements.''
	   Lawmakers believe the government has disregarded expert opinion
that the Paladins were unsuitable for Kuwait's armed forces.
	   Liberal opposition lawmaker Abdullah al-Naibari said the
government was so determined to push through weapons purchases that
it would not let anything block the deals.
	   ``Everyone who stands in the way of these deals, has to go,'' he
said. ``The Parliament itself may have to go so that the deal is
completed.''
	   Islamist lawmaker Adnan Abdul-Samad said weapons purchases were
made on the bases of commissions and not the suitability of the
equipment to Kuwait's tiny army that is still trying to rebuild
itself after the devastating Iraqi occupation.
	   ``In the past the cake was big,'' he told the house. But now
revenues were dwindling because of low oil prices and legislators
have to keep a closer eye on public money, he said.
	   Kuwait foresees a budget deficit of 1.92 billion dinars (dlrs
6.35 billion) for this fiscal year that started July 1.
	   Kuwait has been buying weapons from all five permanent members
of the Security Council, as part of defense pacts and military
cooperation agreements it signed with them since the end of the
1991 Gulf War that liberated it.
	   Britain, one of the contenders for the deal, was still hoping it
would sell Kuwait its AS-90 guns.
	   British Defense Minister George Robertson said during a visit
here Monday that the Kuwaiti leadership assured him the contract
for the Paladins ``was not final.''

	   KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) _ Sudan has lifted its ban on exporting
sorghum after meeting the needs for consumption in the country,
Foreign Trade Minister Osman el-Hadi Ibrahim said Tuesday.
	   Ibrahim told The Associated Press that his ministry would scrap
the 2 percent export tax on the grain, a staple in Sudan, starting
in January to encourage export. He said Sudan faced difficulty
exporting sorghum because of the irregularity of its production.
	   While international aid agencies are shipping vast amounts of
food aid to areas of famine in southern Sudan, the country's own
sorghum cannot reach the afflicted areas for several reasons,
including a lack of roads to get it there at reasonable cost.
	   Sudan lists it local consumption needs at 3.5 million tons,
while production this year was reported at 6 million tons.
	   In production areas, sorghum is now selling for 450,000-500,000
Sudanese pounds (dlrs 250) a ton.

	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Russian aircraft officials were in Iran
Tuesday to finalize a deal for building a new Tupolev passenger
plane here, Iranian radio reported.
	   The delegation is discussing with Iran the sale of a
manufacturing license for the new Tu-334 passenger aircraft, for
which Russia is seeking manufacturing partners, the radio reported.
	   Russia's Tupolev design bureau will roll out the first 100-seat
Tu-334 in late November or early December.
	   The chairman of Iran's parliament, Ali Akbar Nateq-Nouri, signed
an agreement in Russia last year on building the airliners in Iran.
	   The Russian delegation arrived in Iran Monday.
	   The plane is expected to cost dlrs 14 million to dlrs 15
million, the Russian ITAR-Tass news agency said. It was designed to
replace the aging fleet of Tu-134 planes, and will be able to fly
up to 2,000 kilometers (1,200 miles).

	   KUWAIT (AP) _ The Kuwait Cement Co. announced Tuesday it was
raising its capital by 20 percent to 39.05 million dinars (dlrs
129.3 million).
	   The company, which is partly state-owned, called in an
advertisement in the al-Siyassah daily for a general assembly
meeting on Nov. 30 to vote on the raise. It said it was issuing
65.09 million shares and giving subscription priority to share
holders.
	   Kuwait Cement Co. is one of 15 local industrial firms listed on

	   ABU DHABI, United Arab Emirates (AP) _ The United Arab Emirates
has threatened foreign banks with a freeze on hiring foreign
recruits unless they increase the number of local hires, the
Emirates News daily reported Tuesday.
	   The Ministry of Labor will stop issuing employment visas to
banks which fail to increase the number of nationals they hire by
four percent each year, the English-language paper quoted Labor
Minister Mattar Humaid Al Tayer as saying.
	   Al Tayer said the move was in line with the ministry's
commitment to increase the number of locals in the banking sector,
the backbone of the country's economy, the paper said.
	   Many foreign banks, including Citibank, ANZ Grindlays, ABN-AMRO,
Standard Chartered, and British Bank of the Middle East, have
branches in the Emirates.
	   Foreigners make up about three quarters of the 2.4 million
people in the Emirates.

	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ Dutch farmers whose slow-growing
cucumbers have been causing them headaches have found a solution _
aspirin. For the cucumbers, that is.
	   Scientists with the respected Dutch research institute TNO have
discovered that feeding aspirin to young cucumber plants helps
prevent thickening of the root walls.
	   Plants with thick root walls absorb water and minerals less
easily than those with thin root walls, leading to slower growth.
	   ``Aspirin doesn't remove the cause of the thickening, but it
reduces the level of damage,'' plant physiologist Sjoukje
Heimovaara told the Algemeen Dagblad newspaper for Tuesday's
edition.
	   Aspirin contains an acid also made naturally by plants to
protect themselves. No trace of the aspirin, which was fed to
plants in a solution, was found in the cucumbers themselves.
	   Dutch farmers' organization LTO is investigating whether the
active ingredient in aspirin can be registered for use to protect
their cucumbers _ until it is, farmers are not allowed to prescribe
it to their plants.
	   Researchers are now planning to extend their experiment to
eggplants, tomatoes and peppers.

Three soldiers, one rebel killed in clash in East Timor

fellow's death, grafs 2-3, 12-14 &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   DILI, Indonesia (AP) _ Three Indonesian soldiers and one
separatist rebel were killed in a clash in the troubled territory
of East Timor, the military said Tuesday.
	   Meanwhile, 20 soldiers staged a mutiny in protest over the fatal
beating of a private by an army instructor on Saturday.
	   The soldiers have taken over their barracks in the territory's
eastern part, a senior army officer said.
	   The fatal clash Monday came when about 50 rebels attacked a
military post in Manufahi, said Lt. Col. Supadi, East Timor
military chief of staff.
	   The rebels also took away 30 guns and ammunition from the post,
which was guarded by four soldiers, Supadi said.
	   The attack was the third fatal clash recently in Manufahi, about
40 kilometers (25 miles) southeast of Dili, the capital of East
Timor.
	   A week ago, a soldier was shot and killed by pro-independence
rebels, and two soldiers and a civilian were beaten to death by a
group of pro-independence demonstrators in another clash.
	   Nobel laureate and Catholic bishop Carlos Filipe Ximenes Belo
has recently condemned the killings of soldiers and civilians by
anti-integration activists.
	   The attacks came amid rumors of rioting planned to coincide with
the seventh anniversary Thursday of a massacre in which at least 50
people were killed when Indonesian troops fired on a
pro-independence protest Nov. 12, 1991.
	   Independent sources and rights activists claimed a death toll of
at least 200.
	   Indonesia annexed East Timor in 1976 after intervening in a
civil war that broke out during the last days of Portuguese
colonial rule, but the United Nations still considers Portugal the
administering power.
	   Meanwhile, in the mutiny at the post at Lautem, about 200
kilometers (125 miles) east of Dili, officers were forced to flee,
Supadi said.
	   The mutineers, who are holding the dead private's body, want the
instructor, a sergeant, dismissed.
	   Supadi denied claims that the soldiers had fired on an army
helicopter Monday as part of their protest.

Canadian to challenge for Calzaghe's WBO title
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CARDIFF, Wales (AP) _ Joe Calzaghe will make the third defense
of his WBO super-middleweight title against Canada's Syd Vanderpool
at the Cardiff Ice Rink on Dec. 5, promoters announced Tuesday.
	   Vanderpool, 26, was selected from a list of four candidates by
promoter Frank Warren. The others had been another Canadian Eric
Lucas, former WBC middleweight champion Keith Holmes of the United
States, Australia's Rick Thornberry and English veteran Herol
Graham.
	   Warren said Lucas and Holmes declined the offer to fight the
big-hitting Welshman, while Graham has been lined up for a shot at
the vacant British super-middleweight title.
	   Vanderpool, a southpaw from Kitchener, Ontario, has won 24
fights and lost one.
	   ``I'm ready to face anybody in the division,'' Calzaghe said.
``I know I'm the best super-middleweight in the world and I'm
looking forward to putting a string of victories together to prove
it.''
	   Calzaghe has not fought since stopping Paraguay's Juan Carlos
Gimenez in April. He since underwent an operation on his right
wrist.
	   On the same bill, South Africa's Zolani Petelo will defend his
IBF straw-weight title against England's Mickey Cantwell. Cantwell
lost previous world challenges against Jake Matlala and Eric
Jamili.
	   Petelo has a record of 17 fights, with 13 wins, two losses and
two draws. This will be his third defense of the title.

Italian lawyers strike holds up trials in Italy
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Hundreds of criminal lawyers protesting a court's
decision to overturn a law meant to protect defendants stayed away
from courtrooms Tuesday, holding up trials in most Italian cities.
	   The strike is planned to last through Friday, when a rally has
been scheduled in Rome.
	   The law in question forced witnesses to repeat in court
testimony given behind closed doors. Lawyers insist the measure is
necessary to protect defendants because it allows witnesses to be
cross-examined during a trial.
	   Without the law, prosecutors can rely on testimony collected
outside of court as proof. Prosecutors say most witnesses, in many
cases Mafia turncoats, are afraid to repeat allegations in open
court.
	   The ruling by the Constituitional Court allows judges, however,
to order a witness to testify though it is no longer required.
	   Prosecutors in Palermo, the Sicilian capital, threatened legal
action against lawyers who failed to turn up for work, accusing
them of interrupting a public service.

	   TORONTO (AP) _It was a long, frustrating night for 287
passengers and crew aboard a Lufthansa plane.
	   Flight 474 from Germany was taxiing to Terminal 2 Monday night
at Pearson International Airport when it slid off the airstrip and
got stuck in the mud.
	   It took 90 minutes for the airline to assess the situation and
arrange for buses to shuttle passengers to the terminal.
	   The last group left the plane 2 1/2 hours after the plane first
got stuck. No one was hurt.
	   The plane was finally freed from the muck after about three
hours.

	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Sales of passenger cars and
commercial vehicles in the Philippines in this year's first 10
months fell 55 percent from a year earlier to 29,493, an industry
association announced Tuesday.
	   The Chamber of Automotive Manufacturers of the Philippines Inc.
attributed the sharp decline to tight credit. Banks have raised
interest rates and become very selective with loan approvals since
the regional financial crisis began in July 1997.

vehicles fell 57 percent to 1,981, the association said.

Anxiety in EU over Cyprus overshadows opening enlargement talks
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with more comments, details; TRIMS pvs &QL; 
 &UR; By ROBERT WIELAARD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ Cyprus urged the European Union Tuesday
to push Turkey into helping end the division of the Mediterranean
island and not obstruct the EU membership drive of the Greek
Cypriots.
	   Opening formal membership talks with the EU, Cypriot Foreign
Minister Ioannis Kasoulides stressed his government's commitment to
the ``search of a viable and just solution.'' Reunification of the
island communities will also improve Greek-Turkish relations, he
said.
	   The EU also opened membership talks with Poland, Hungary, the
Czech Republic, Slovenia and Estonia.
	   All candidates must meet EU norms in 30-odd areas, the toughest
being agriculture, environment, industrial policy and internal
market.
	   Cyprus' problems overshadowed Tuesday talks. The tone was set
Monday with a joint statement by the Dutch, German and French
governments questioning the wisdom of admitting Cyprus unless the
Mediterranean island is first reunified.
	   Kasoulides said the three should have addressed themselves to
Turkey which has been criticized for hampering United Nations
efforts to reunify Greek and Turkish Cypriots.
	   Hungarian Foreign Minister Janos Martonyi said his country
intends to join in 2002. ``There are no genuine points of dispute.
This gives us hope that (entry in 2002) is possible.''
	   Though the EU is at pains to avoid fixing dates, conventional
wisdom has it that first candidates will not join before 2004.
	   Poland aims for Dec. 31, 2002, entry date. Its foreign minister
Bronislaw Geremek, speaking of a Greek veto threat of other
candidates if Cyprus is frozen out, told reporters:
	   ``This must not become a European problem.'' He was ``optimistic
... there is a possibility for dialogue'' to resolve the Cyprus
problem.
	   The Netherlands, Germany and France said the division of Cyprus
weighed on the island's membership chances as evidenced by the fact
Greek and Turkish Cypriots have been unable to form a joint EU
membership negotiating team.
	   Turkey invaded the northern one-third of Cyprus in 1974 and
installed a government, backed by 30,000 troops. The government is
only recognized by Turkey.
	   ``I wish to reiterate once again that the government of Cyprus,
despite the absence of positive developments and the hardening of
the Turkish position, ... devotes all its powers and exerts all its
efforts in search of a viable and just solution,'' Kasoulides told
the EU foreign ministers.
	   Sources said there was a fear in the EU of importing
Greek-Turkish rivalry by admitting Cyprus and that once inside the
EU Greek Cypriots _ the only government the international community
recognizes on the island _ may hamper reunification and keep
Turkish Cypriots out of the union.
	   The EU ministers met in one-on-one sessions with their
colleagues from the six candidate nations.
	   ``The political will to push ahead with enlargement is shared on
all sides,'' said German Deputy Foreign Minister Guenther Veheugen.
Germany assumes the EU presidency in January. ``I reassured (the
candidates) the new German government will push ahead with the
enlargement process energetically.''
	   Other would-be EU members are Lithuania, Latvia, Slovakia,
Romania and Bulgaria but they have been put in a second group of
less-ready nations.
	   On Monday, the leaders of Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia
complained the EU moved so slowly it could destabilize the Baltic
region. Lithuanian Prime Minister Gediminas Vagnorious warned of
``unnecessary tensions'' that could complicate relations with
Russia.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ A spokesman for Kosovo's separatist
Albanian guerrillas on Tuesday accused Serb police of provoking
fights and said any violence committed by his side is purely in
self-defense.
	   Adem Demaci, spokesman for the Kosovo Liberation Army, did
specifically comment on Serb accusations that two of their police
officers were kidnapped and summarily shot by the Albanian
fighters.
	   Ethnic Albanians accuse Serbs of opening fire first on a group
of their men _ and of violating a U.S.-brokered cease-fire intended
to halt hostilities between Serbs and the ethnic Albanians who make
up 90 percent of Kosovo's population.
	   Violence by both sides has increased in the past week, including
at least three incidents in which police reported killing KLA
fighters who shot at them first.
	   The two policemen disappeared Friday, the same day Serb police
shot to death five ethnic Albanian guerrillas, including a
commander of two divisions.
	   Both of the slain policemen had gunshot wounds to the head,
indicating they had been killed execution-style. Serb police
spokesman Bozidar Filic said the executions showed the Kosovo
Liberation Army's utter disregard for the U.S.-sponsored
cease-fire.
	   He warned Monday that unless ```international representatives''
secure two main roads running through Malisevo by Wednesday, police
will increase their patrols and ``allow safe passage'' _ indicating
a possible new Serb action.
	   David Scheffer, the roving U.S. ambassador on war crimes issues,
viewed the bodies in Malisevo, a devastated central village, as he
toured the area with the Kosovo Diplomatic Observer Mission.
	   ``This represents one of the problems that is being experienced
here with the cease-fire, and that is that there are violations of
the cease-fire by both sides,'' Scheffer said.
	   Serb authorities suspect the killed policemen were kidnapped by
the KLA in retaliation for the shootings of the five guerrillas.
	   The rebels say police shot at the five as they drove in two
vehicles from Opterusa village, while police claim the guerrillas
opened fire first.
	   The KLA claims the killing of the five guerrillas violated a de
facto cease-fire in Kosovo. Under a 4-week-old agreement between
Milosevic and U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke, Milosevic's forces were
supposed to cease hostilities.
	   Demaci, speaking in Pristina, sounded the same argument. He said
the violence was due to provocations by the Serbian side ``to make
international monitors believe it was the KLA violating the
cease-fire.'' The guerrillas ``are compelled to defend themselves
whenever Serb forces try and reenter Albanian villages,'' he added.
	   Speaking about last week's encounter between U.S. mediator
Christopher Hill and KLA representatives, and Hill's presentation
of a U.S.-sponsored draft peace plan for Kosovo, Demaci called the
meeting ``a great and fruitful step forward.'' But he said the
guerrillas had no comment yet on the plan.
	   The guerrillas have grudgingly accepted the de-facto cease fire
in Kosovo that calls for a large-scale cutback of Serb police and
Yugoslav army forces in the province. But they refuse to agree to
any plan that falls short of independence, and in past comments
have rejected the draft, which calls only for a restoration of
autonomy for Kosovo, a province of Serbia, the dominant Yugoslav
republic.
	   Demaci has been long at odds with Ibrahim Rugova, the Kosovo
Albanian leader supported by foreign powers in his efforts at a
peaceful accommodation with the Serbs. In an indirect slap at
Rugova, Demaci on Tuesday criticized ``those in power (who) now
refuse to relinquish even the tiniest part of that power.''
	   He said any chance of agreement between him and Rugova ``had
passed by now.'' And he urged Rugova's people to stay out of plans
to form an independent, predominantly Albanian police force for
Kosovo, saying that role was reserved for KLA fighters.
	   Dozens of Serb police were killed before and after the start of
a Serb crackdown on ethnic Albanian separatists last February in
Kosovo, a majority Albanian province. Several hundred other people,
mostly ethnic Albanians, have been killed, and as many as 300,000
driven from their homes.

Nigerian villagers commemorate activist's hanging

<TEXT>
	   LAGOS, Nigeria (AP) _ Villagers from southeastern Nigeria's
Ogoni region were holding rallies Tuesday to commemorate the 1995
hanging of Ogoni activist and writer Ken Saro-Wiwa.
	   The Movement for the Survival of the Ogoni People, which
Saro-Wiwa led until his execution, called for the rallies, which
follow a Monday night vigil in the late activist's home village of
Bana.
	   Processions are also planned in the university town of Ile Ife
as well as the cities of Owerri, Port Harcourt and Lagos.
	   Saro-Wiwa and eight other Ogoni environmental and human-rights
activists were hanged on Nov. 10, 1995. They were accused of
treason and involvement in a string of killings, though activists
say the nine were executed because of their anti-government
activities.
	   The executions sparked international anger against the former
military regime of Gen. Sani Abacha and brought calls for an
international boycott against the Anglo-Dutch oil giant Shell,
which has been accused of devastating the Ogoni environment and
turning a blind eye to human-rights abuses in Nigeria.
	   Shell has since pulled out of the Ogoni region, pledging not to
return without a broad agreement that includes the Ogonis.
	   Shell asked its non-essential staff not to come to work Tuesday
at its Lagos headquarters, fearing demonstrations planned there
could block access.
	   On Monday, meanwhile, three Nigerian human rights groups went to
court requesting that the convictions of the nine be invalidated
and the bodies be released for proper burials.
	   The Committee for the Defense of Human Rights, the Eastern
Nigerian Unity Association and the Movement for the Survival of
Eastern Nigeria and the Niger Delta made the request to the federal
high court in the southeastern city of Port Harcourt.
	   Abacha, who died in June, has been replaced by Gen. Abdulsalami
Abubakar, who has pledged to return Nigeria to democracy next year.

Philippine banks grant National Steel indefinite debt moratorium
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ National Steel Corp., the
Philippines' largest steel manufacturer, has been granted an
indefinite debt moratorium by its creditors, a bank official said
Tuesday.
	   National Steel has encountered problems meeting its maturing
obligations due to the weaker peso and higher interest rates.
	   Creditors decided to give National Steel an indefinite debt
moratorium since all of the company's 12 billion pesos (dlrs 300
million) in loans are covered by assets, Philippine National Bank
chairman Edgardo Angara said. The moratorium covers principal
payments only.
	   ``Everyone is adequately covered,'' Angara said.
	   PNB has the largest loan exposure among National Steel's
creditors, estimated at 5 billion pesos (dlrs 125 million).
	   National Steel officials were not immediately available for
comment.
	   Earlier this year, National Steel's 14 creditor banks granted
the company a 60-day debt moratorium while studying the financial
viability of the company and evaluating its assets.
	   Prime lending rates, currently at 14 to 20 percent, rose sharply
after the onset of Asia's currency crisis. In the third quarter of
last year, prime lending rates rose as high as 35 percent.
	   Prior to the economic crisis, prime lending rates averaged 13
percent.

Arafat accuses Netanyahu of wasting time over peace accord
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ANN S. KIM &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   RAMALLAH, West Bank (AP) _ Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat on
Tuesday accused Israel of willfully wasting time before
implementing the land-for-security agreement with the Palestinians.
	   A senior Palestinian negotiator said the Palestinians might stop
fulfilling their commitments under the accord if Israel's Cabinet
did not ratify the U.S.-brokered agreement in the next few days.
	   A test of the Palestinians' intention could come Nov. 21 when
the 110-member Palestinian Central Council is to take a step toward
revoking provisions in the PLO charter calling for Israel's
destruction.
	   Arafat did not refer Tuesday to holding up implementation, but
sharply criticized Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu who
has four times in the past two weeks postponed or broken off
Cabinet sessions to ratify the accord.
	   ``We expect that Netanyahu will waste a lot of time and he's not
going to implement the agreement honestly and quickly at all,''
Arafat said after meeting with Britain's Duke of Kent.
	   Palestinian negotiator Hassan Asfour said that in response to
the delays by Israel, the Palestinians are considering ``whether to
put on hold its implementation of their commitments.''
	   ``Implementation cannot be unilateral. It must be mutual and
reciprocal,'' Asfour told reporters.
	   As part of the 12-week accord, Israel is to withdraw from 13
percent of the West Bank, in exchange for tougher Palestinian
measures against Islamic militants.
	   U.S. officials have said the clock began ticking on Nov. 2, or
10 days after the Oct. 23 signing of the agreement at the White
House.
	   In a first step, the Palestinians submitted a detailed
anti-terror plan. In a second stage on Nov. 6, the PLO Executive
Committee reaffirmed a letter by Arafat to U.S. President Bill
Clinton in which the Palestinian leader listed the clauses of the
PLO charter that were no longer valid.
	   In exchange, Israel was to withdraw from 2 percent of the West
Bank on Nov. 16, but Netanyahu adviser David Bar-Illan said this
week that it was likely the pullback would be delayed.
	   Netanyahu has said he cannot implement the agreement until it
has been ratified by the Cabinet and Israel's parliament. Netanyahu
has not decided whether to convene the ministers this week.

U.N. health chief calls for more funding
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photo GEV101 &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ Countries must increase funding of the World
Health Organization to avoid cutbacks in its activities, the
agency's new director-general told its members Tuesday.
	   Freezes have led to a 22 percent cut in real terms of WHO's
budget over the last 10 years, said Brundtland, who was presenting
a restructured agency after her first three months in the post.
	   ``This trend cannot continue,'' she added. More money is needed
to ``keep pace'' with diseases such as HIV/AIDS, Brundtland told
reporters.
	   The former Norwegian prime minister took over the 50-year-old
WHO in July, promising to address criticism that it was preoccupied
with internal problems and lack of focus.
	   The agency has now raised around half of a planned dlrs 10
million ``renewal fund'' to be spent over three years, Brundtland
said.
	   Its 50 programs have been reduced to 35 and reorganized under
nine new senior managers. WHO has also launched new programs to
combat smoking among young people and malaria.
	   The agency has a two-year budget for this year and next of some
dlrs 835 million.
	   Voluntary contributions from governments should be in line with
priorities identified by WHO itself, Brundtland said.
	   ``It could happen that we may say no, thank you,'' to funding
offers that don't meet those criteria, she added.
	   WHO organizes massive vaccination efforts, coordinates global
response to epidemics and fosters the widespread distribution of
medicines.
	   It has more than 3,500 staff worldwide, some 1,300 of them based
in Geneva. Staff were not laid off in the restructuring exercise.

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ Dutch farmers whose slow-growing
cucumbers have been causing them headaches may have found a
solution _ aspirin. For the cucumbers, that is.
	   Scientists with the respected Dutch research institute TNO have
discovered that feeding aspirin to young cucumber plants helps
prevent thickening of the root walls.
	   Plants with thick root walls absorb water and minerals less
easily than those with thin root walls, leading to slower growth.
	   ``Aspirin doesn't remove the cause of the thickening, but it
reduces the level of damage,'' plant physiologist Sjoukje
Heimovaara told the Algemeen Dagblad newspaper for Tuesday's
edition.
	   Aspirin contains an acid also made naturally by plants to
protect themselves. No trace of the aspirin, which was fed to
plants in a solution, was found in the cucumbers themselves.
	   A Dutch farmers' organization is investigating whether the
active ingredient in aspirin can be registered for use to protect
their cucumbers. Until it is, farmers won't be allowed to prescribe
it to their plants.
	   Researchers also are planning to extend their experiment to
eggplants, tomatoes and peppers.

Geneva Convention survey launched

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ Guerrillas, soldiers and refugees are among those
to be questioned in a massive survey aimed at improving respect for
humanitarian law in times of armed conflict, the international Red
Cross said Tuesday.
	   The dlrs 1 million survey, titled People on War, has already
been launched in Colombia. It will also cover Bosnia, Somalia,
Nigeria, South Africa and El Salvador.
	   In each country, Red Cross volunteers will ask at least 1,000
people their views on whether international law has helped curb the
excesses of war and how to improve compliance with the Geneva
Conventions and other humanitarian treaties.
	   Displaced civilians, former hostages, soldiers, guerrillas,
security detainees and medical personnel, as well as the general
public, will be targeted.
	   There will also be a parallel survey in peaceful countries,
starting with France.
	   The project is meant to increase awareness of rules that exist
for people's protection in war time and encourage discussion of
humanitarian law and modern-day conflicts.
	   Results of the survey, and personal stories of those involved,
will be published next year to mark the 50th anniversary of the
Geneva Conventions.
	   The conventions are overseen by the International Committee of
the Red Cross and are meant to guarantee protection for wounded
soldiers, prisoners of war and civilians.
	   One of their main failings is that they cover only state parties
and international wars whereas many of today's conflicts are civil
wars or involve guerrilla forces.
	   ``For the ICRC, the anniversary is an opportunity for the world
to reflect on what has occurred in the half-century since the
conventions were adopted, to take stock of the present and to
consider the future of international law and humanitarian action,''
an ICRC statement said.

	   --
	   FREETOWN, Sierra Leone (AP) _ West African peacekeepers have
called on people living behind rebel lines in northern Sierra Leone
to move to army-protected areas before an air strike operation
begins.
	   Addressing reporters at a press briefing in Freetown on Monday,
ECOMOG spokesman Squadron Leader Paul Aghimen said plans to flush
out rebels in the north were being hindered by the presence of
civilians.
	   He appealed to them not to collaborate with the rebels but to
cooperate with ECOMOG and move to safety before an intensified
assault on rebel areas begins.
	   Rebels attacked the northern town of Maboloto on Friday killing
27 people. Peacekeepers, rallying together in a return raid, killed
at least 67. They also freed hundreds of civilians, Aghimen
announced.
	   ECOMOG together with traditional Kamajor hunters made gains in
the main rebel stronghold of Kailahun District over the weekend,
Aghimen said.
	   Aid workers and independent observers have said members of Lt.
Col. Johnny Paul Koroma's ousted military junta and their rebel
allies have killed, raped and maimed thousands of people in a
revenge campaign against the restored government led by President
Ahmed Tejan Kabbah.

No. 1 radio reported.
	   With presidential elections drawing closer, President Omar Bongo
has accused the opposition of trying to provoke a civil war in the
country by searching for arms and mercenaries abroad, the radio
reported Monday.
	   A major opposition coalition denied the charges, countered that
unnamed Gabonese officials have been caught with containers of
illegal arms, the report said.
	   Neither of the claims was backed with specific details.
	   Bongo is seeking re-election for another five-year term in
presidential elections scheduled for Dec. 6. Only a handful of
candidates are challenging him.
	   Weeks of violence followed 1993 elections _ the country's first
multi-party vote since Bongo took power in 1967 and declared Gabon
a one-party state.
	   Bongo agreed to those elections only after pro-democracy
protests forced him to legalize political opposition. He won with
51 percent of the vote.

	   PRETORIA, South Africa (AP) _ Twenty-one suspects were arrested
during a joint police and army anti-crime operation in Mpumalanga
last week, the army said on Tuesday.
	   It said in a statement in Pretoria more than 440 kilograms of
marijuana was confiscated, while 13 illegal weapons and 26 stolen
vehicles were recovered over the same period.
	   Three companies of soldiers from Middelburg took part in the
operation, which was conducted in Dennilton, Siyabuswa and
Kamhluswa.
	   The soldiers and members of the police set up road blocks and
vehicle check points and conducted searches and mobile and foot
patrols from Tuesday to Sunday last week.

 &UR; KLA accuses Serb police of violating cease-fire
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with comments from KLA representative.
 &UR; AP Photos
 &UR; By TOM COHEN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ A spokesman for Kosovo's separatist
Albanian guerrillas on Tuesday accused Serb police of provoking
fights and said any violence committed by his side is purely in
self-defense.
	   Adem Demaci, spokesman for the Kosovo Liberation Army, did not
specifically comment on Serb accusations that two of their police
officers were kidnapped and summarily shot by the Albanian
fighters.
	   Ethnic Albanians accuse Serbs of opening fire first on a group
of their men _ and of violating a U.S.-brokered cease-fire intended
to halt hostilities between Serbs and the ethnic Albanians who make
up 90 percent of Kosovo's population.
	   Violence by both sides has increased in the past week, including
at least three incidents in which police reported killing KLA
fighters who shot at them first.
	   The two policemen disappeared Friday, the same day Serb police
shot to death five ethnic Albanian guerrillas, including a
commander of two divisions.
	   Both of the slain policemen had gunshot wounds to the head,
indicating they had been killed execution-style. Serb police
spokesman Bozidar Filic said the executions showed the Kosovo
Liberation Army's utter disregard for the U.S.-sponsored
cease-fire.
	   He warned Monday that unless ```international representatives''
secure two main roads running through Malisevo by Wednesday, police
will increase their patrols and ``allow safe passage'' _ indicating
a possible new Serb action.
	   David Scheffer, the roving U.S. ambassador on war crimes issues,
viewed the bodies in Malisevo, a devastated central village, as he
toured the area with the Kosovo Diplomatic Observer Mission.
	   ``This represents one of the problems that is being experienced
here with the cease-fire, and that is that there are violations of
the cease-fire by both sides,'' Scheffer said.
	   Serb authorities suspect the killed policemen were kidnapped by
the KLA in retaliation for the shootings of the five guerrillas.
	   The rebels say police shot at the five as they drove in two
vehicles from Opterusa village, while police claim the guerrillas
opened fire first.
	   The KLA claims the killing of the five guerrillas violated a de
facto cease-fire in Kosovo. Under a 4-week-old agreement between
Milosevic and U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke, Milosevic's forces were
supposed to cease hostilities.
	   Demaci, speaking in Pristina, sounded the same argument. He said
the violence was due to provocations by the Serbian side ``to make
international monitors believe it was the KLA violating the
cease-fire.'' The guerrillas ``are compelled to defend themselves
whenever Serb forces try and reenter Albanian villages,'' he added.
	   Speaking about last week's encounter between U.S. mediator
Christopher Hill and KLA representatives, and Hill's presentation
of a U.S.-sponsored draft peace plan for Kosovo, Demaci called the
meeting ``a great and fruitful step forward.'' But he said the
guerrillas had no comment yet on the plan.
	   The guerrillas have grudgingly accepted the de-facto cease fire
in Kosovo that calls for a large-scale cutback of Serb police and
Yugoslav army forces in the province. But they refuse to agree to
any plan that falls short of independence, and in past comments
have rejected the draft, which calls only for a restoration of
autonomy for Kosovo, a province of Serbia, the dominant Yugoslav
republic.
	   Demaci has been long at odds with Ibrahim Rugova, the Kosovo
Albanian leader supported by foreign powers in his efforts at a
peaceful accommodation with the Serbs. In an indirect slap at
Rugova, Demaci on Tuesday criticized ``those in power (who) now
refuse to relinquish even the tiniest part of that power.''
	   He said any chance of agreement between him and Rugova ``had
passed by now.'' And he urged Rugova's people to stay out of plans
to form an independent, predominantly Albanian police force for
Kosovo, saying that role was reserved for KLA fighters.
	   Dozens of Serb police were killed before and after the start of
a Serb crackdown on ethnic Albanian separatists last February in
Kosovo, a majority Albanian province. Several hundred other people,
mostly ethnic Albanians, have been killed, and as many as 300,000
driven from their homes.

Russia: ethnic Albanian separatists main threat to Kosovo peace
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia insisted Tuesday that the main threat to
peace in Kosovo comes from ethnic Albanian separatists, not the
government of Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic.
	   Ethnic Albanians accuse Milosevic's Serb-led police of resuming
attacks in violation of a U.S.-brokered cease-fire intended to halt
hostilities between Serbs and the ethnic Albanians. Albanians make
up 90 percent of the population of Kosovo, a province in Serbia.
	   Milosevic withdrew his troops after NATO threatened airstrikes
on Yugoslavia if he continued attacks on Kosovo's Albanians.
	   Russia opposed the strikes, and has long been sympathetic to
Serbia, a fellow Slavic, Orthodox Christian nation.
	   ``We believe that in the current situation the main threat to
the process of a political settlement in Kosovo comes from Albanian
extremists ... because they are trying to take advantage of the
situation, furthering their own aims,'' Russian Foreign Ministry
spokesman Vladimir Rakhmanin was quoted as saying by the ITAR-Tass
news agency.
	   Violence by both sides has increased in the past week, but
ethnic Albanians accuse Serbs of being first to open fire.

	   KUWAIT (AP) _ The Constitutional Court rejected Tuesday a
defense argument raised by lawyers for a Kuwaiti editor sentenced
to prison for publishing a joke deemed insulting to Islam.
	   The attorneys for Mohammad al-Saqar, editor of the independent
daily Al-Qabas, claimed that the 1961 publications law under which
he was convicted contradicts the constitution.
	   In the joke printed in Al-Qabas, a teacher asks his students:

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ Dutch farmers whose slow-growing
cucumbers have been causing them headaches may have found a
solution _ aspirin. For the cucumbers, that is.
	   Scientists with the respected Dutch research institute TNO have
discovered that feeding aspirin to young cucumber plants helps
prevent thickening of the root walls.
	   Plants with thick root walls absorb water and minerals less
easily than those with thin root walls, leading to slower growth.
	   ``Aspirin doesn't remove the cause of the thickening, but it
reduces the level of damage,'' plant physiologist Sjoukje
Heimovaara told the Algemeen Dagblad newspaper for Tuesday's
edition.
	   Aspirin contains an acid also made naturally by plants to
protect themselves. No trace of the aspirin, which was fed to
plants in a solution, was found in the cucumbers themselves.
	   A Dutch farmers' organization is investigating whether the
active ingredient in aspirin can be registered for use to protect
their cucumbers. Until it is, farmers won't be allowed to prescribe
it to their plants.
	   Researchers also are planning to extend their experiment to
eggplants, tomatoes and peppers.

Moenchengladbach fires coach after humiliating defeats
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Bonhof confirmed as coach &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOENCHENGLADBACH, Germany (AP) _ After conceding 15 goals in the
last two games, the Bundesliga club Borussia Moenchengladbach fired
coach Friedel Rausch on Tuesday.
	   Once one of the most glorious Bundesliga clubs with five
national titles and two UEFA Cup crowns in the 1970s,
Moenchengladbach is languishing at the bottom of the league and
faces an uphill battle to avoid relegation.
	   In its last two games, Moenchengladbach was crushed 8-2 by Bayer
Leverkusen and 7-1 by Wolfsburg.
	   Rausch, 58, was hired in April and under his guidance the club
escaped demotion in the final round last season.
	   So far this season, Moenchengladbach has won one and lost eight
of 11 games, conceding 34 goals, by far the worst defensive record
in the 18-team league.
	   When it dominated the Bundesliga 20 years ago with its
flamboyant, attacking style, Moenchengladbach produced such stars
as Guenter Netzer, Rainer Bonhof, Jupp Heynckes and Berti Vogts,
who resigned as national team coach after this summer's World Cup.
	   Bonhof, who worked as Vogts' assistant and now is in charge of
Germany's junior team, was named Rausch's successor. Bonhof was a
member of Germany's team that won the 1974 World Cup title.

German conservative group flies home after denied entry to Israel

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BERLIN (AP) _ Members of a conservative political group returned
to Germany on Tuesday after their trip to Tel Aviv was aborted.
Israeli officials had said they would deny entry to the group's
leader, a right-wing extremist once convicted for inciting racial
hatred.
	   Joachim Siegerist, head of the Hamburg-based German
Conservatives, was not on board Monday's Frankfurt-Tel Aviv flight,
information Israel's Foreign Ministry said it learned only after
notifying Lufthansa that it suspected he was.
	   The German airline made an unscheduled landing Monday night in
Istanbul, Turkey, and ordered the group off the plane. The other
passengers continued to Tel Aviv.
	   Siegerist is booked on a flight for Tel Aviv on Sunday, and said
he intends to make the trip. In a statement, he said his group
wants to foster friendship between Germans and Jews and denied
accusations of anti-Semitism.
	   Israel's Foreign Ministry said it would recommend that the
Interior Ministry refuse his entry.
	   ``He's a person who participated in extreme racist activities.
Not only that, but his activities are known to all, in Germany and
in Israel and in other countries as well,'' Aviv Shiron, an Foreign
Ministry spokesman said Tuesday.
	   The 33 passengers who returned to Germany were traveling as part
of a church-organized tour of Israeli holy sites, the German
Conservatives' statement said. Among them was the group's honorary
president, Heinrich Lummer.
	   ``I cannot understand why the Israeli authorities did this. I
find it unbelievable and unacceptable,'' Lummer told Associated
Press Television Network on Tuesday in Turkey before returning to
Germany. ``I expect our government to find out why this happened,
and ultimately we expect an apology.''
	   Germany's Foreign Ministry declined to comment, saying they
didn't have details of the incident.
	   Siegerist, 51, was sentenced to 18 months in prison in 1995 for
incitement to racial hatred because of a mass mailing describing
gypsies as a ``criminal bunch.'' His sentence was lightened to
probation on appeal last year.

IRA's senior female prisoners freed under terms of Belfast accord

 &UR; With BC-Ireland-Royal Visit &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) _ Two of the Irish Republican
Army's senior female prisoners were freed Tuesday in accordance
with the historic Northern Ireland agreement.
	   Martina Anderson of Londonderry and Ella O'Dwyer of Tipperary
both received life sentences in 1985 in connection with bomb
attacks on London and English seaside towns.
	   Gerry Kelly, a senior figure in the IRA-allied Sinn Fein party,
embraced both of the freed inmates outside Maghaberry prison west
of Belfast, where women convicted of terrorist crimes are kept in
their own unit. Kelly was convicted of London car bombs in 1972 and
led a mass escape from Northern Ireland's Maze prison in 1983.
	   More than 200 of an eligible 450 prisoners _ from both the IRA
and outlawed pro-British paramilitary groups _ have already been
paroled early as part of April's agreement on how Protestants and
Catholics should jointly govern Northern Ireland. The releases are
conditional on each group maintaining a cease-fire.

Palestinian Authority resumes dialogue with Islamic militants
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip (AP) _ Despite its crackdown on Islamic
militants, the Palestinian Authority has renewed a high-level
dialogue with Hamas and Islamic Jihad, apparently trying to prevent
a violent backlash, participants said Tuesday.
	   Hamas and Islamic Jihad representatives met separately Monday
with Tayeb Abdel-Rahim, the secretary general of the Palestinian
Authority and one of Yasser Arafat's closest advisers. Abdel-Rahim
would not comment Tuesday on the meetings.
	   However, Imad Falouji, a former Hamas activist and member of
Arafat's Cabinet, suggested the aim was to work out a relationship
in which Hamas and Islamic Jihad would be recognized as legitimate
opposition groups. In exchange, the two groups would stop trying to
sabotage the Israeli-Palestinian peace accords.
	   ``We are not against the opposition, but they should respect
Palestinian law and respect the commitments of the Palestinian
Authority,'' Falouji said in an apparent reference to the peace
agreements between Israel and the Palestinians.
	   It was not clear whether Hamas and Islamic Jihad would agree to
such a trade, which would require calling a halt to attacks on
Israelis. Such violence is a key element of the ideology of both
groups.
	   The latest crackdown began Oct. 29, in response to a suicide
attack by Hamas on an Israeli convoy in the Gaza Strip. In a second
bombing, two Islamic Jihad activists blew themselves up Friday in
Jerusalem's outdoor market.
	   The violence prompted Israel to suspend ratification of the Oct.
23 land-for-security agreement under which Israel was to withdraw
from 13 percent of the West Bank, in exchange for tougher
Palestinian measures against Islamic militants.
	   In response to the bombings, Arafat's security forces detained
hundreds of suspected Hamas and Islamic Jihad followers and placed
the spiritual leader of Hamas, Sheik Ahmed Yassin, under house
arrest.
	   Mahmoud Zahar, a Hamas leader, said that in his Monday meeting
with Abdel-Rahim, he demanded the release of all detainees against
whom there was no evidence of involvement in attacks. Zahar said
the Palestinian Authority must also release Yassin.
	   ``Our demands were clear that no one should be arrested just for
belonging to Hamas,'' Zahar told Associated Press Television News.
	   Zahar said the group wanted to continue the contacts. ``We are
talking about a dialogue in which each side's needs can be
addressed in order to reach common ground,'' he said.
	   Nafez Azzam, an Islamic Jihad leader, refused to discuss the
meetings.
	   The renewed talks were likely to anger the Israeli government
which has made an uncompromising campaign against the militants a
key condition for implementing the peace accord.
	   However, Arafat is faced with a possible violent backlash if he
takes the crackdown too far. Hamas, especially, is strongly rooted
in Palestinian society, providing badly needed social services with
a network of clinics, schools and kindergartens.

U.N. refugee agency cites security concerns in central Africa
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ Two Sudanese have been killed in an attack on the
Mboki refugee camp in the Central African Republic, a spokesman for
the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees said Tuesday.
	   UNHCR staffers and some private relief workers were threatened
in the attack, apparently by Sudanese rebels, last Friday, said
Kris Janowski.
	   After gunfire was heard in the area again Monday, several relief
workers were flown by U.N. military observers to Bangui, the
republic's capital, but other relief workers stayed at the
settlement, Janowski told reporters.
	   At UNCHR's request the republic flew in 30 government troops
Monday to reinforce the one police officer who was present at Mboki
at the time of the raid, he said.
	   Janowski said the incident was similar to an Oct. 3 assault on a
refugee center in Congo by the Sudanese People's Liberation Army,
which looted UNHCR offices and chased refugees across the border
back into Sudan, Janowski said.
	   Some 35,000 Sudanese refugees live in the Central African
Republic settlement at Mboki, which is spread over 40 square
kilometers near the Sudanese and Congolese borders.
	   According to humanitarian workers in southern Sudan, 17,000 of
the 61,000 refugees in Congo have returned to the Yambio area since
the raid Oct. 3.
	   Janowski said the agency also is ``extremely concerned'' about
another potential source of instability in central Africa _ the
disappearance of ``significant numbers'' of Rwandan men from
refugee camps in the Republic of Congo.
	   ``We fear they may take up arms'' in neighboring Congo, he said.
	   New fighters would add to the turmoil in the country, where the
government and its allies face a rebellion supported by other
African countries.
	   ``UNHCR has condemned the recruitment of refugees and asylum
seekers for military action in the past, and has appealed to states
to take all necessary measures to prevent activities which could
further destabilize the region,'' Janowski said.

Estonians cut water supply to Russian border town
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TALLINN, Estonia (AP) _ Estonian authorities on Tuesday turned
off the sole water supply to the Russian border city of Ivangorod
because the city has not paid its water bill.
	   Officials in the Estonian city of Narva, where the region's main
water utility is located, said that Ivangorod, a city of 12,000,
had failed to pay water bills totaling more than dlrs 1 million.
	   Non-payment of Ivangorod's water bill has been an ongoing
problem that has been exacerbated by Russia's worsening economic
crisis. The cash-strapped Russian town says it doesn't have the
money to pay.
	   Estonia's government last year paid part of Ivangorod's water
bill, but on Tuesday refused to say whether it was willing to pay
the debt again.
	   Estonian government spokesman Daniel Vaarik said the problem
involved national and municipal governments and also privately
owned companies, which made finding a solution more difficult.
	   ``This is a serious situation and very complicated to solve,''
he told The Associated Press. ``But someone has to pay the bill or
the Narva Water Company, which is partly private, will go bankrupt.
That would be a huge problem for Narva and all of Estonia.''
	   Narva and Ivangorod, about 200 kilometers (120 miles) east of
Tallinn, have had a common water system since before World War II,
when Ivangorod was part of Estonia. After Estonia was annexed by
the Soviet Union in 1940, their infrastructures became more
intertwined.
	   With the Soviet collapse in 1991, Ivangorod fell under the
jurisdiction of Russia and Narva remained part of Estonia, which is
considered the most successful free-market reformer of the 15
former Soviet republics.
	   Under Russia, Ivangorod's economy has fallen into near ruin,
while Narva's economy has thrived by comparison.

Nigerian villagers commemorate activist's hanging
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LAGOS, Nigeria (AP) _ Villagers from southeastern Nigeria's
Ogoni region were holding rallies Tuesday to commemorate the 1995
hanging of Ogoni activist and writer Ken Saro-Wiwa.
	   The Movement for the Survival of the Ogoni People, which
Saro-Wiwa led until his execution, called the rallies, which follow
a Monday night vigil in the late activist's home village of Bana.
	   Processions are also planned in the university town of Ile Ife
as well as the cities of Owerri, Port Harcourt and Lagos.
	   Saro-Wiwa and eight other Ogoni environmental and human-rights
activists were hanged on Nov. 10, 1995. They were accused of
treason and involvement in a string of killings, though activists
say the nine were executed because of their antigovernment
activities.
	   The executions sparked international anger against the former
military regime of Gen. Sani Abacha and brought calls for an
international boycott against the Anglo-Dutch oil giant Shell,
which has been accused of devastating the Ogoni environment and
turning a blind eye to human-rights abuses in Nigeria.
	   Shell has since pulled out of the Ogoni region, pledging not to
return without a broad agreement that includes the Ogonis.
	   Shell asked its nonessential staff not to come to work Tuesday
at its Lagos headquarters, fearing demonstrations planned there
could block access.
	   On Monday, meanwhile, three Nigerian human rights groups went to
court requesting that the convictions of the nine be invalidated
and the bodies be released for proper burials.
	   The Committee for the Defense of Human Rights, the Eastern
Nigerian Unity Association and the Movement for the Survival of
Eastern Nigeria and the Niger Delta made the request to the federal
high court in the southeastern city of Port Harcourt.
	   Abacha, who died in June, has been replaced by Gen. Abdulsalami
Abubakar, who has pledged to return Nigeria to democracy next year.

<TEXT>
	   ABUJA, Nigeria (AP) _ The family of Nigeria's late dictator,
Gen. Sani Abacha, has handed back to the government more than dlrs
750 million in state funds illegally amassed by the former leader,
a government spokesman said.
	   The money _ including about dlrs 625 million, 75 million British
pounds and dlrs 3 million worth of Nigeria naira _ has been
deposited into a special account at the Central Bank of Nigeria,
government spokesman Mohammed Haruna told reporters Monday.
	   During his five-year military dictatorship, Abacha diverted
hundreds of millions of dollars in government funds to his personal
accounts. Since his death in June, Abacha's family has returned
vast sums of money.
	   Others in Abacha's government also siphoned money from the state
to amass personal fortunes. Nigeria's former finance minister,
Anthony Ani, said Abacha's national security adviser Ismail Gwarzo
had channeled about dlrs 1.3 billion worth of foreign reserves into
private accounts.
	   Although accustomed to military rule and conflict, Nigeria
suffered enormously under Abacha, whose leadership was marked by
divisive policies, endemic and institutionalized corruption and
brutal repression.
	   Abacha was replaced by another military leader, Gen. Abdulsalami
Abubakar, who has vowed to hand power over to an elected civilian
government. Abubakar has been working to free political prisoners
and redress the financial mismanagement that marked Abacha's
tenure.

UN envoy says Angola appears heading back to war
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PRETORIA, South Africa (AP) _ The government and a former rebel
movement in Angola have broken their peace agreement and the
country appears to be drifting back to war, a U.N. official said
Tuesday.
	   ``The peace process worked very well until now, and suddenly we
are facing a deadlock. From that deadlock, war is on its way,''
said Iffa Diallo, the United Nations special envoy for Angola.
	   Diallo said Jonas Savimbi, the leader of the former rebel
movement UNITA, was the first to break the 1994 Lusaka Protocol
that brought a negotiated peace to Angola. But he said the
government also had broken the accords.
	   ``You have in the middle the Lusaka agreement. During the day
Savimbi is beating the protocol and during the night the government
is beating the protocol,'' said Diallo.
	   The accord ended two decades of fighting that erupted after
Angola won independence from Portugal.
	   The agreement required UNITA, a Portuguese acronym for the
National Union for the Total Independence of Angola, to demobilize
its 70,000 guerrilla fighters and relinquish control of almost half
the country.
	   It also committed the government to guarantee the former rebels
the right to full political participation as civilians.
	   The accord has been crumbling recently with renewed fighting and
the government's decision to negotiate only with a group of UNITA
dissidents who split with leader Jonas Savimbi.
	   Diallo contended compliance with terms of the accord is the only
way to bring a lasting peace to Angola.
	   The envoy, who met with Deputy Foreign Minister Aziz Pahad, is
on a tour of African countries in a bid to secure support for the
U.N. peace efforts in Angola that have cost more than dlrs 1
billion in the last four years.
	   He said the U.N. cannot sit back and watch warlords impose their
own rule on areas of Angola.
	   ``I hope that soon those who are condemning this agreement to
death will realize that they have in front of them voices which are
ready to protect this peace process,'' said Diallo.
	   He said he has not yet discussed the possibility of sending a
regional peacekeeping force. However, he said that and other
concrete steps to stop the slide toward war might be discussed at a
later date.
	   The envoy said he was not concerned about the Angolan
government's refusal to let him meet Savimbi, who is prevented by a
U.N. resolution from leaving Angola. Diallo said he was in contact
with Savimbi almost every second day.
	   Diallo said three weeks remained before the expiry of a deadline
on the U.N.'s involvement in Angola. After the three weeks, Diallo
said the Security Council would decide whether to continue the
mission.

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ The European Union opened formal
membership talks Tuesday with five Eastern European nations and
Cyprus, which asked for help pushing Turkey to try to end the
division on the Mediterranean island.
	   Opening formal membership talks with the EU, Cypriot Foreign
Minister Ioannis Kasoulides stressed his government's commitment to
the ``search of a viable and just solution'' to the separation of
the island's Greek and Turkish populations. Reunification of the
island communities would also lead to a ``substantial improvement''
in relations between Mediterranean rivals Greece and Turkey, he
said.
	   Cyprus _ plus Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic, Slovenia and
Estonia _ began formal membership talks on Tuesday. Last week, the
EU judged these countries to have made a good start of transposing
EU rules and regulations into their laws.
	   Hungarian Foreign Minister Janos Martonyi said his country is
hoped to join in 2002, although the EU has set no date for any
candidate. ``There are no genuine points of dispute,'' he told
reporters.
	   The problems of Cyprus loomed large Tuesday, one day after the
Dutch, German and French governments issued a rare declaration
questioning the wisdom of admitting Cyprus unless the Mediterranean
island is first reunified.
	   Kasoulides said the three should have addressed Turkey, which
has been criticized for hampering U.N. efforts to reunify Greek and
Turkish Cypriots.
	   Turkey invaded the northern third of Cyprus in 1974 and
installed a government, backed by 30,000 troops. The government is
only recognized by Turkey.
	   ``I wish to reiterate once again that the government of Cyprus
... devotes all its powers and exerts all its efforts in search of
a viable and just solution,'' Kasoulides told the EU foreign
ministers.
	   Sources said there was EU fear of importing Greek-Turkish
rivalry by admitting Cyprus. There were also worries that admitting
Greek Cypriots _ the only government on the island that the
international community _ could hamper reunification and keep the
rival Turkish Cypriot government out of the union. As an EU member
Cyprus gets a veto right over which countries join the EU.
	   Austrian Foreign Minister Wolfgang Schuessel downplayed the
Dutch, German and French statement saying the EU still viewed
Cyprus as a valid candidate and that membership talks can encourage
U.N. reconciliation efforts there.
	   After meeting with Kasoulides, the EU foreign ministers met in
one-on-one sessions with their colleagues from Poland, Hungary, the
Czech Republic, Slovenia and Estonia.
	   The list of would-be EU members also includes Lithuania, Latvia,
Slovakia, Romania and Bulgaria but these countries are in a second
group of less-ready nations.
	   On Monday, the leaders of Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia, at a
meeting in Oslo, complained that the slow pace of EU deliberations
could destabilize the Baltic region. Conventional wisdom has it
that the most successful candidates will not join before 2004.
	   Lithuanian Prime Minister Gediminas Vagnorious warned of
``unnecessary tensions'' that could complicate relations with
Russia and other neighbors unless the EU accelerated its screening
of candidates.
	   Formal membership negotiations with Cyprus and five East
European nations open several days after the European Commission
declared the expansion drive ``broadly on track.'' It said all
candidates were pursuing the necessary economic and political
reforms.
	   The Commission said Latvia, Lithuania and Slovakia are doing so
well they may be advanced to the group of fast-track candidates as
of 1999.
	   But on Monday, French Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine cautioned
against advancing the slower group, saying that could leave out in
the cold Romania and Bulgaria, which face the toughest task in
meeting membership criteria.

Palestinian official attacks peace deal

<TEXT>
	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ A senior PLO official opposed to current
Mideast peace formulas Tuesday appealed to the Palestinians to
reject an agreement Yasser Arafat signed with Israel last month.
	   Farouk Kaddoumi, head of the PLO's political department, said
``we shall resist this agreement with all our strength.''
	   ``I appeal to my brethren inside (self-rule areas) not to
respect this agreement,'' he told reporters after a meeting with
Lebanese Foreign Minister Faris Bweiz.
	   Kaddoumi, the virtual foreign minister of the Palestine
Liberation Organization, is also an opponent of the 1993 and 1995
Israeli-Palestinian peace agreements.
	   He lives in Tunis, Tunisia, and refuses to go to Gaza until the
last Israeli leaves the territory. But he also has not broken
completely with Arafat, the Palestinian Authority president, and
continues to wield influence in the PLO.
	   Kaddoumi said the Oct. 23 Wye agreement signed by Arafat and
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is aimed at sparking
internal Palestinian strife.
	   Under the agreement, Israel must withdraw from 13 percent more
West Bank territory and Arafat must crack down on Palestinian
extremists opposed to peace with Israel.
	   Kaddoumi said Israel will not implement the agreement because
``Netanyahu is a liar and a deceiver.''
	   Bweiz, the Lebanese foreign minister, repeated Lebanon's
criticism of the agreement, describing it as ``a real catastrophe
for the Palestinian people.''
	   Bweiz also warned of Palestinian infighting as a result of the
deal.
	   ``We worry that the only accomplishment is pushing the
Palestinian people toward a real civil war,'' Bweiz said, referring
to the Palestinian police crackdown against militants after
anti-Israeli bombings.

Russia reaches tentative food aid deal with European Union,

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia has reached a tentative agreement on food
aid with the European Union just days after completing a similar
deal with the United States, news reports said Tuesday.
	   Under the plan, Russia would purchase food worth 400 million
European currency units (dlrs 480 million) and receive E.U.
humanitarian aid worth 10 million to 12 million ecus (dlrs 12 to 14
million), Deputy Prime Minister Gennady Kulik said, according to
Russian news agencies.
	   The two sides will meet shortly to finalize the deal, he said.
EU officials said Monday that a deal was in the works, but have not
yet announced any agreement.
	   ``We are ready for talks on the subject,'' Prime Minister
Yevgeny Primakov told reporters Tuesday. ``We shall duly assess the
European Union proposal, and we are going to offer the maximum
transparency in the aid distribution.''
	   The food purchased by the Russian government would be sold on
the Russian market with the profits spent on government social
programs, Kulik said. Russia wants the humanitarian aid to be
targeted primarily toward its frigid northern regions, he said.
	   The report comes just four days after Russia and the United
States signed a dlrs 625 million agreement for 3.1 million tons of
U.S. food aid, including wheat, corn, pork and beef.
	   Russia's economic crisis, combined with drought and falling food
imports, have raised concerns about the country's food supplies
heading into the winter. No serious food shortages have been
reported, but the government wants to ensure that plenty is on
hand.
	   Meanwhile, Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov rounded up several of
his top Cabinet ministers and headed to parliament in a bid to win
broad support for his economic recovery program.
	   The session was closed, but lawmakers said discussions focused
on next year's budget.
	   Russia's economic crisis hit almost three months ago, and
Primakov's government has moved slowly to put together a response.
The prime minister has sought to stabilize the shrinking economy
and has not taken any drastic steps.
	   President Boris Yeltsin has receded into the background since
the crisis hit and has transferred control over the economy to
Primakov, but Kremlin aides insist that the president would step in
if conditions grew worse.
	   ``If the president thinks that the government's economic
decisions have a tinge of fatal error, he will interfere,''
Yeltsin's deputy chief of staff, Oleg Sysuyev, said in an interview
published Tuesday with the Moskovsky Komsomolets newspaper.
	   Meanwhile, Russia's Finance Minister Mikhail Zadornov said
Tuesday that the government would print up to 25 billion rubles
(dlrs 1.7 billion) before the end of the year to cover the budget
deficit. The government had earlier insisted that no more than 15
billion rubles (dlrs 1 billion) would be printed.

Two ethnic Albanians sentenced to prison terms
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Two ethnic Albanians in Kosovo were
sentenced Tuesday to three years in prison each for joining the
rebels fighting Serb forces, the Tanjug news agency reported.
	   The district court in Pec, 50 kilometers (30 miles) west of
Pristina, ruled that Muja and Sinan Tafiljaji were guilty of
joining the Kosovo Liberation Army. The two let the rebels use
their cars, dug trenches and took part in setting up KLA check
points in the Serb-ruled province, said Tanjug.
	   Hundreds of ethnic Albanians are awaiting trial in Kosovo on
similar charges.

Prince Philip's visit to Dublin foreshadows likely visit by queen
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with comments from prince, visit concludes; CORRECTS
that previous royal visit was 1911 sted 1913 &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   DUBLIN, Ireland (AP) _ Britain's Prince Philip made his first
official trip Tuesday to the Irish Republic, an event observers say
will set the stage for a state visit by his wife, Queen Elizabeth
II.
	   No British monarch has visited the territory of the Republic of
Ireland since 1911.
	   The prince first traveled to Dublin Castle, former seat of
British rule before the predominantly Catholic south of Ireland won
independence in 1922, alongside Irish President Mary McAleese. The
two figures unveiled joint plans for millenium-year projects
involving young people in both parts of Ireland.
	   Noting that ``it would be ridiculous to pretend there haven't
been problems between the north and the south'' of Ireland, the
prince told an audience: ``I think that any initiative which can
somehow overcome the rather artificial divisions is tremendously
good.''
	   The prince, also known as the duke of Edinburgh, then met Irish
Prime Minister Bertie Ahern and other cabinet ministers during his
brief stay before flying on to engagements in Northern Ireland.
	   Tuesday's visit provided the latest expression of increasingly
good relations between Britain and Ireland, whose governments
worked closely together to promote April's compromise accord in
British-ruled Northern Ireland, where competing British and Irish
nationalities have fueled bloodshed for 30 years.
	   The last time a reigning British monarch visited Ireland was
when George V stayed at what was then the Vice Regal Lodge in
Dublin's vast Phoenix Park. Today it is the official residence of
McAleese, Ireland's elected and largely symbolic head of state,
where the prince's Royal Air Force helicopter landed.
	   McAleese and the British queen are scheduled to appear together
Wednesday in Belgium to commemorate the millions slain on the
Western Front in World War I, when thousands of Irishmen _ from
north and south, Protestant and Catholic alike _ fought and died as
British soldiers.
	   Irish officials think the most likely timing for a visit to
Ireland by the queen would be in 2000, after all the key provisions
of the Northern Ireland agreement are in place.

Street protests mark opening of government assembly in Indonesia

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Violent street protests and a massive
security clampdown marked the opening Tuesday of a government
assembly that is carving out a new political future for Indonesia.
	   The People's Consultative Assembly, Indonesia's highest
legislative body, met at the national Parliament, guarded by
thousands of armed troops and surrounded by razor wire.
	   Tuesday night, a convoy of 30 buses carrying student protesters,
some sitting on the roofs and waving red and white Indonesian
flags, drove past the Parliament. They taunted phalanxes of police
and soldiers lined up in front of the gates, but there were no
clashes.
	   In several areas earlier in the day, however, pro- and
anti-government activists faced off, throwing rocks before soldiers
broke up the fighting.
	   Much of Tuesday's trouble involved teen-age boys armed with
knives and bamboo spears. As many as 120,000 have been recruited by
pro-government activists as private security guards to protect the
assembly from student protests.
	   Hundreds of the private security guards faced 5,000
anti-government students protesters on a busy road near the
University of Indonesia.
	   Outside the legislature, rival groups also clashed briefly.
Troops blocked a toll road and dispersed the crowd with sticks but
made no arrests.
	   In East Jakarta, hundreds of the pro-government guards threw
rocks and fought with residents, who later surrounded them in a
tense standoff. Witnesses said several people were injured. One
automobile was set afire.
	   About 30,000 troops and police have been deployed across Jakarta
to safeguard the assembly meeting.
	   Critics doubt that the 1,000-member assembly will deliver on
promises to dismantle the 32-year-old authoritarian legacy of
former President Suharto, who quit in May after a wave of deadly
riots and protests.
	   However, Parliament Speaker Harmoko, once a Suharto supporter,
warned Tuesday that anarchy could engulf the world's fourth most
populous nation unless fundamental political changes were made.
Like many Indonesians, Suharto and Harmoko use only one name.
	   The assembly is meeting for four days as Indonesia grapples with
its worst economic crisis in decades.
	   Inflation and unemployment have soared, and millions have been
sinking into poverty. Rioting and looting have occurred
sporadically for months in many areas.
	   The assembly's main job is to set a date sometime in late May
for parliamentary elections and to help frame new laws to legalize
free political parties.
	   Harmoko said the assembly would revoke decrees that preserved
special presidential powers during the Suharto era and would
promote human rights and clean government.
	   In a sign of compromise, military chief Gen. Wiranto has said
the armed forces are willing to discuss demands to limit their
prominent role in politics.
	   The military has a guaranteed 75 seats in the 500-member
Parliament. One proposal is to cut its representation to 55 seats.
	   Despite promises of change, opponents claim most of the
assembly's members are holdovers from the Suharto era.
	   With Indonesia's main opposition figures not part of the
assembly, critics fear it will try to bolster the position of
President B.J. Habibie.
	   Habibie, a longtime friend and former aide to Suharto, plans to
run as a presidential candidate next year.
	   In a show of discontent, Indonesia's three main opposition
figures held their first joint meeting since Suharto's downfall and
demanded that the government disband the private security groups.
	   Megawati Sukarnoputri, the daughter of Indonesia's founding
president, and Islamic leaders Abdurahman Wahid and Amein Rais also
called on the military to phase out its role in politics.
	   They demanded that a presidential election be held three months
after next May's parliamentary election, instead of in December as
planned by Habibie.
	   At a rally earlier Tuesday, hundreds of students called on the
assembly to disband. They also demanded that Habibie quit and that
the military get out of politics altogether. And they called for
Suharto to be tried for corruption.

Firemen save own firehouse from electrical fire
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   OSLO, Norway (AP) _ Firemen in the southern Norway town of
Gjoevik didn't even have to start their truck to respond to a
report of dense smoke. It was coming from their own firehouse.
	   An electrical charger used to keep one of their firetruck's
batteries juiced up short-circuited, billowed smoke and nearly set
the truck on fire last week, the Oppland Arbeiderblad newspaper
said Tuesday.
	   ``Even though we have a lot of fire-fighting equipment, the
smoldering could quickly have spread with serious consequences,''
fire chief Geir Pladsen was quoted as saying.
	   The smoke filled the garage and began to seep into the crew's
dayroom, where a fireman was staffing the town's emergency fire
telephone. He sounded the alarm, helped find the source of the
smoke and then went to the hospital to be treated for minor smoke
inhalation.
	   The newspaper said the incident exposed several areas in which
the firehouse in Gjoevik, about 100 kilometers (60 miles) north of
Oslo, failed to meet the fire department's own fire codes,
including the lack of a fire door.

Rwanda plans mass prisoner release despite protests
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By HRVOJE HRANJSKI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KIGALI, Rwanda (AP) _ Despite protests from genocide survivors,
the government said Tuesday it will release 31,000 people
imprisoned for the 1994 slaughter, but whose files are lost or
contain no evidence against them.
	   ``For us, there is no option. People without files or without
sufficient evidence to hold them in prison must be released,'' said
Patrick Mazimhaka, a minister in President Pasteur Bizimungu's
office. ``We won't succumb to public pressure.''
	   The first prisoners may be released as early as next week,
officials said.
	   The influential association of genocide survivors, IBUKA, has
objected, arguing that among those who will be freed are
perpetrators of the genocide whose cases were lost due to
negligence, malice or poor organization.
	   ``We believe that the innocent have no place in jail. But first
prosecutors have to make sure there is no evidence against them
before they walk free,'' said Frederick Mutagwera, IBUKA chairman
and president of the Rwandan Bar Association. ``Having no file
doesn't mean anything.''
	   Rwanda has jailed about 130,000 people on suspicion of killing
or helping to kill more than 500,000 minority Tutsis and
politically moderate Hutus. Many, detained on a simple accusation,
have not been charged or questioned, partly because their numbers
are overwhelming.
	   The country's overburdened justice system is recovering from
years of civil conflict in which many judges, lawyers and court
officials were killed or fled. IBUKA has complained that an
inadequate number of trained lawyers and prosecutors has
contributed to the lack of evidence against prisoners.
	   So far, more than 330 people have been tried in connection with
the genocide, and 116 have been sentenced to death. On April 24, 22
convicts were executed.
	   Rwanda has come under international pressure to clean up
overcrowded prisons and speed up trials.
	   Justice officials said they expected a number of those released
to be rearrested. Prisoners will be released in the areas where
they allegedly committed their crimes, and where potential
witnesses may recognize them.
	   Mazimhaka said measures will be taken to avoid mob justice, and
protect genocide survivors who want to testify against those
released for lack of evidence.
	   Originally, the government said 10,000 prisoners were eligible
for release, but Mazimhaka said that is only the first batch. A
total of 31,000 will be set free over a period of years, he said.
	   Mistrust of public servants, many of whom served under the
defeated Hutu government, also is fueling objections.
	   The semi-independent New Times weekly said prosecutors protested
last week to the Justice Ministry because hundreds of prisoners'
files were removed by junior staff from one prison to another,
apparently in preparation for the release.
	   In the process, some files were lost or destroyed.
	   The ministry said it will investigate. Two justice ministers
already have been fired for alleged incompetence or failure to act
on reports that its employees were protecting jailed family or
friends.

 &UR; Eds: Places quotation marks on hebephile, 2nd graf; word not in

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Former millionaire businessman and
international fugitive Phillip Harold Bell admitted Tuesday to
sexual relationships with four youths, but denied he is a
pedophile.
	   Giving evidence at his trial on multiple child sex charges, Bell
described himself as a ``hebephile.''
	   ``I'd like the hebephile relationship to be understood as a
rather beautiful relationship between a man and a youth which may
or may not have a sexual element to it,'' Bell told the New South
Wales state District Court.
	   ``There are tens of thousands of hebephiles in our society who
are good men. ... The central driving force of a hebephile
relationship is love.''
	   Bell, 64, who has pleaded innocent to 38 sex offenses involving
five boys aged in their early teens during the mid-1980s, said he
had loved and been loved by more than one youth ``over many, many
years.''
	   ``I tell you and I tell the world that a hebephile is not a
pedophile.''
	   Bell was acquitted Tuesday of one charge because of lack of
evidence.
	   He denied having any sexual contact with three of the
complainants, but admitted having sex with two, and with two other
witnesses, but at a later time than they said acts occurred.
	   Bell said his relationship with one of the witnesses began when
the youth was 16, which was illegal in Australia, where the age of
consent is 18 years, but not in Switzerland, where he took the
youth on a visit and where the age of consent is 16.
	   ``In that one specific relationship I was a criminal according
to (Australian) law but a perfectly ordinary gay guy according to
Swiss law,'' Bell said.
	   Bell was arrested last December in South Africa after fleeing
Australia. An international search lasting more than a year found
him running a surfing school at Jeffrey's Bay, on South Africa's
southern coast.
	   Bell was extradited back to Australia after spending nearly five
months in jail near Port Elizabeth.
	   Last month, chief prosecutor Mark Tedeschi said Bell had preyed
on vulnerable youths for his own sexual gratification, enticing
them with offers of cash for odd jobs and showering them with gifts
and privileges in return for sexual favors.

Homesick Brian Laudrup back in Denmark: Money can't buy you all
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JAN M. OLSEN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) _ Brian Laudrup didn't break a golden
contract with European powerhouse Chelsea for the money, he said
Tuesday. His new employer, FC Copenhagen, will give him one-tenth
of what the English Premier League paid him.
	   ``It's not a matter of money. It's a matter of emotions,''
Laudrup said, saying he wanted to return home after a decade-long
career abroad including stints with FC Bayern Munich, Italian
powerhouses Fiorentina and Milan, and the Glasgow Rangers.
	   ``Something was missing. I wanted to come back to my roots,''
Laudrup told reporters, only three months after joining the London
team.
	   On Friday, he signed a 2 1/2-year contract with FC Copenhagen.
	   Laudrup, 29, admitted quitting professional soccer to have more
time with his family has been haunting his mind for the past
months.
	   FC Copenhagen would give him a monthly salary that is one-tenth
of his 200,000-pound-a-month (dlrs 334,000) deal with the London
club, Laudrup said.
	   But ``what can one use all that money for if you're not happy?
he said.
	   FC Copenhagen manager Flemming Oestergaard declined to disclose
the transfer sum. News reports said it was at 1 million pounds
(dlrs 1.6 million).
	   The deal also includes a clause stating the Danish club cannot
sell Laudrup to another club without Chelsea's approval because the
English Premier League still has the rights over the Dane. In such
case, FC Copenhagen would have to buy him free, Oestergaard said.
	   Negotiations with Chelsea to ``reach an agreement about quality
of life,'' have been ``emotional and complicated,'' said
Oestergaard who declined to elaborate.
	   Laudrup hoped other clubs would follow the London team's example
and take more human interest in their players.
	   ``Chelsea has been just great. They finally accepted that I
wanted to go back,'' the striker said.
	   ``They showed great caliber. I hope other clubs would do the
same,'' said Laudrup won't wear FC Copenhagen's jersey immediately.
A heel injury will keep him off the turf but he expected he would
be fit before Christmas.
	   Laudrup, who began his career with FC Brondby in 1987, joined
the Danish side the same year and scored 21 goals in 82 matches.

Thailand to set up audit committees at ministries
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Seeking to tighten budgetary controls
at all government agencies, the Cabinet on Tuesday approved setting
up audit committees to examine each ministry, supplanting an
inefficient centralized system now in place.
	   ``Due to the current economic crisis, the government sees the
need to better scrutinize how they are spending their money,''
government spokesman Akapol Sorasuchart said at a news conference
after the weekly Cabinet meeting.
	   The proposed audit committees will be independent from
ministerial authority, and will examine on a regular basis how each
ministry spends its allocations from the government's annual
budget, he said.
	   Akapol said each committee is likely to include three to seven
members, whose appointments will need approval from the Cabinet.
	   ``This will strengthen internal auditing in the ministries,'' he
said. ``It will also build up confidence among the public that they
spend money following government policies.''
	   Akapol said budget auditing currently is centralized at three
main agencies _ the Office of the Auditor-General of Thailand, the
Comptroller-General's Department and the Budget Bureau.
	   These agencies are national and cannot carry out auditing at
each ministry on a regular basis, he added. There are 14 ministries
in the country, plus the Office of the Prime Minister.

Turks commemorate founder of modern republic under heavy security

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ Tens of thousands paid tribute Tuesday to
Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, founder of secular Turkey, under tight
security following what authorities said was a foiled attack on his
mausoleum two weeks ago.
	   Soldiers, in uniform and plainclothes, stood guard around the
mausoleum as crowds poured in to commemorate the 60th anniversary
of his death. A military helicopter flew overhead.
	   Police said they foiled an attack on the mausoleum during the
celebrations of the 75th anniversary of the republic. It was
allegedly planned by members of the Anatolian Federal Islamic
State, a radical group based in Germany which aims to replace the
Turkish government with an Islamic one.
	   Police detained two people for insulting Ataturk in two separate
cities while the nation was observing a minute of silence at the
exact time when Ataturk died in 1938, the Anatolia news agency
said.

Oil by Dutch master Van Ruisdael fetches dlrs 1.05 million
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ A landscape by Dutch old master
Jacob van Ruisdael fetched 2 million guilders (dlrs 1.05 million)
at auction, earning four times more than the estimate.
	   The oil, pegged to sell at between 350,000 and 500,000 guilders
(dlrs 185,000 and 264,500), went under the hammer at an auction of
old master paintings Monday and triggered a bidding war between two
buyers, said Christie's spokeswoman Yvonne Ploegsma.
	   ``It's a good painting, and two people really wanted to have
it,'' she said Tuesday.
	   The painting is formally titled ``A Pollarded Willow Overhanging
a Pool with a Cornfield, a Wood, and a Church Spire Beyond.'' The
identity of the buyer was not revealed.
	   Described in the auction catalog as a ``delicately painted
landscape,'' the 26-by-34-centimeter (10-by-14-inch) oil is
dominated by a willow standing by a pond. In the distance, a church
spire juts into the sky and a farmer carrying a long pole walks
away from the tree.
	   The painting, which came from an unidentified Dutch family, was
signed by Van Ruisdael but was left undated.
	   Van Ruisdael is considered one of the greatest and most
versatile landscape artists of the late 17th century.

Former Kremlin Cup champion Ivanisevic struggles through win
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Third-seeded Goran Ivanisevic of Croatia fired
eighteen aces to defeat Carsten Arriens of Germany in the second
day of play in the dlrs 1.1 million Kremlin Cup tennis tournament
Tuesday.
	   It took the heavy-serving Croatian, the 1996 Kremlin Cup
champion, an hour and twenty minutes to struggle through against
Arriens. Ivanisevic failed to break a single serve and won both
sets on a tiebreaker 7-6 (7-5), 7-6 (7-3).
	   ``If a qualifier is a good player and ... is serving decently,
it's very tough to break. But I was pretty confident at two
tiebreakers,'' Ivanisevic told reporters. ``I never thought I could
lose the match.''
	   Lars Burgsmuller of Germany made the first upset as he downed
fifth-seeded Boghdan Ulihrach of the Czech Republic in straight
sets 6-4, 6-2.
	   Another qualifier, Raemon Sluiter of the Netherlands, eliminated
seventh-seeded Daniel Vacek of the Czech Republic, 6-2, 6-4.
	   Jan Kroslak of Slovakia, who substituted for last year's
runner-up Petr Korda, outplayed Oliver Gross of Germany 6-3, 6-1.

Austrian bobsled pilot quits after failing drug test
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ Austria's bobsled pilot Hubert Schoesser
has retired shortly before the start of the World Cup season after
failing a drug test for anabolic steroids.
	   Schoesser, who was third in overall four-man World Cup standings
last season, admitted taking steroids and announced his retirement
Tuesday in face of an automatic two-year ban.
	   The pilot, who turns 32 on Wednesday, said he took the steroids
to speed up his recovery from a painful back injury.
	   ``It was a great stupidity but you always think you are not
going to be the one caught,'' he said.
	   Schoesser was tested randomly at home one month ago by an
official of the International Bobsled Federation (FIBT).
	   The driver had already traveled to Calgary for the opening event
of the World Cup season this coming weekend, but was called back
home by the Austrian federation when it was informed of the
positive test.
	   Schoesser took the silver medals at the 1993 and 1995 World
Championships and won the four-man World Cup title in 1994.
	   He is the second Austrian bobsled star to be involved in a
doping case in recent years. Gerhard Rainer was sent home just
before the 1994 Lillehammer Olympics.

Coalition leaders decide to cut the number of ministries
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ Leaders of the governing coalition
decided Tuesday to reduce the number of government ministries as
part of an effort to streamline government work and speed up
economic reforms.
	   Prime Minister Radu Vasile met the leaders of the five coalition
parties and decided to abolish five of the 22 ministries. The
Privatization and Reform ministries were disbanded, the two
portfolios being put under the direct responsibility of the
premier.
	   The Communications, Research and Tourism ministries were to be
downgraded to national agencies. The leader of a national agency is
not a member of the government.
	   ``We wanted to form a government of only 18 ministers, including
the prime minister,'' said after the meeting the leader of Peasant
Party, Ion Diaconescu.
	   The changes will be formally approved by the government shortly.
	   Although reformists won elections almost two years ago promising
to reform the economy along western lines, purchasing power has
slumped and the national currency is overvalued, discouraging
exports and foreign investment.
	   Only dlrs 3.6 billion of foreign money has poured into Romania
since 1989, when communism ended _ a small amount compared to other
former communist countries.
	   Foreign and domestic investors have also been frustrated by
political bickering and bureaucracy.

Schools shut down in Russia's Far East for lack of heat
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with population of Vladivostok in 2nd graf. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Schools and daycare centers in Russia's Pacific
port city of Vladivostok shut down Tuesday because heat has not
been turned on in the city and it was too cold to conduct class, a
news report said.
	   Vladivostok Mayor Viktor Cherepkov appealed to the local
prosecutor's office to file charges against local energy supplier
Dalenergo for not turning on heat to the city of 600,000 even
though temperatures are dropping below freezing, according to the
Interfax news agency.
	   But Dalenergo leaders retorted that the city has not paid its
debts or signed a contract for winter heating. As a result,
Dalenergo didn't have enough money to buy fuel for the winter or
repair some of its pipes, officials said.
	   Still, Dalenergo officials said the entire city would get heat
in the next two days, Interfax reported.
	   Heating the Far East has been a serious problem since the fall
of the Soviet Union, as local energy suppliers and regional
governments, all short on cash, squabble with each other over
unpaid debts.
	   The situation is particularly bad in Vladivostok, where
long-standing rivalry between Cherepkov and regional governor
Yevgeny Nazdratenko has all but paralyzed many city services.

Prime minister dismisses political pressure, but says power
</HEADLINE>
transition planned &QL; 
 &UR; With BC-Malaysia-Anwar Trial &QL; 
 &UR; By KEVIN COSTELLOE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Malaysia's outspoken prime
minister on Tuesday dismissed the growing popular pressure against
his 17-year rule, but said he already is planning a gradual
transition of power.
	   Mahathir Mohamad, who is Asia's longest-ruling leader, also
defended the tight currency controls the government adopted in
September, saying they had improved the country's battered economy.
	   ``I would like to step down as soon as possible, but I have a
responsibility to make sure that my successor can carry on where I
leave off,'' the prime minister said in a live interview on CNN
television. He said the succession will take at least a year, and
will be linked to elections planned for 1999.
	   The 72-year-old prime minister did not name any potential
replacement, saying that's up to his UMNO political party.
	   His one-time designated successor, former deputy prime minister
Anwar Ibrahim, is on trial in Kuala Lumpur on charges of sexual
misconduct and corruption.
	   That trial has created an international uproar. It has caused
U.S. President Bill Clinton and Canadian Prime Minister Jean
Chretien to rule out any private meetings with Mahathir during a
Pacific Rim summit next week in Kuala Lumpur.
	   Anwar's trial has also sent angry Malaysians into the streets,
in dozens of protests against Mahathir's grip on power. But in the
CNN interview, the smiling, relaxed Mahathir dismissed the
importance of those protests.
	   ``I don't think the reform movement would snowball into a very
big movement. At the moment, it concerns only a few people, a very
small minority,'' Mahathir said.
	   Critics say many Malaysians have turned against Mahathir, and
point to the example of President Suharto, who was toppled as a
result of riots last spring in neighboring Indonesia.
	   Malaysia, once one of the robust Asian economies challenging
traditional Western powerhouses, is stuck in an economic crisis
that started in the summer of 1997.
	   Mahathir acknowledged that ``we have been wrong, we have made
mistakes.'' But he staunchly defended the currency controls that
many economists say will give the Southeast Asian country a
short-term growth spurt, but hinder long-term progress.
	   He said government financial reserves have gone up and the Kuala
Lumpur stock market has improved, while house and motor vehicle
sales are up.
	   ``All of these indicators have shown that the economy is
improving,'' Mahathir said.
	   He predicted the ``anarchy'' in the international financial
sector ``cannot be allowed for much longer.'' He said it would take
global powers at least three or four years to decide whether to
implement the kinds of regulations that would let Malaysia lift its
currency controls.
	   Mahathir has consistently blamed unbridled currency speculators
for many of his country's woes, a charge he repeated Tuesday night.

No soon end to crisis in Russia, Ukraine, says Soros
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With AP Photo KIV101 &QL; 
 &UR; By VIKTOR LUHOVYK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Russia and Ukraine must urgently reform
their economies to avoid a deeper crisis, but the two countries'
governments do not seem willing to do so, financier George Soros
said Tuesday.
	   ``There is a way out for Russia, as well as Ukraine, but it
requires political will and leadership,'' Soros told reporters. ``I
don't see it at the present time in both countries.''
	   Soros spoke after a meeting with Ukrainian President Leonid
Kuchma, at which the two men discussed Ukraine's growing economic
problems and its difficulties in meeting the International Monetary
Fund's requirements for further disbursement of a dlrs 2.2 billion
loan.
	   An IMF mission in Ukraine last week said the government must
drastically improve tax collection and quicken reforms in key
sectors to qualify for the next tranche of the loan, which was
approved in September.
	   Soros, who arrived in Ukraine on Tuesday and will leave
Thursday, has pumped significant aid into the former Soviet
republic and neighboring Russia in recent years.
	   He said the government's tensions with the leftist-dominated
parliament put Ukraine in danger of being left without IMF aid.
	   ``It's kind of a stalemate situation. It's very dangerous,
because without an IMF program, Ukraine could follow in the
footsteps of Russia,'' Soros said.
	   The Ukrainian government is owed dlrs 2.3 billion in unpaid
taxes, while wage arrears throughout the country have reached
nearly dlrs 2 billion.
	   Government officials have acknowledged that IMF assistance has
remained virtually the only source of much-needed foreign money for
the former Soviet republic, whose prolonged economic crisis has
scared away private investors.
	   Soros said Ukraine was in a slightly better situation than
Russia, because ``Ukraine still has an IMF program in effect.'' The
IMF froze a dlrs 22.6 billion bailout loan to Russia after it
devalued the ruble and defaulted on domestic debt in August.
	   But Soros added that Ukraine's government must urgently
implement radical structural reforms to avoid undermining the
country's fragile stability.
	   ``Stability (in Ukraine) is maintained, but it's achieved at the
expense of not paying the social security arrears,'' Soros said.
	   Soros's stay in Ukraine is part of a book promotion tour,
Kuchma's spokesman Oleksandr Martynenko said.
	   Soros said he came to Ukraine also to study the activities of
his Kiev-based Vidrodzhennia charity foundation, which has set up
an art gallery in Kiev and funds scholarships for Ukrainian
students abroad.

De Klerk wants state to fund case against truth panel
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) _ Former president F.W. de Klerk
wants the government to fund his court case against a panel which
found him guilty of human rights abuses during apartheid, a
newspaper reported Tuesday.
	   The Truth and Reconciliation Commission handed over its final
report to President Nelson Mandela last month, but a passage on de
Klerk was blacked out after a last minute legal challenge to the
finding.
	   The Truth Commission has promised to fight de Klerk. The case
will go to court in March.
	   Quoting de Klerk's spokesman David Steward, the Cape Argus
newspaper reported that South Africa's last white president had
applied for state funding to pay his lawyers. As a former state
official, de Klerk could qualify because the case involves acts
carried out on behalf of the state.
	   The commission's final report was to have found de Klerk an
``accessory after the fact'' to bombings in the 1980s of the
headquarters of a church group and of a labor federation, which
housed anti-apartheid organizations.
	   However, government officials said granting de Klerk's request
looked unlikely. Mandela spokesman Parks Manklahana told the
newspaper that ``in all likelihood we are going to reject this
request.''
	   The Truth Commission was set up a year after 1994's all race
elections ended white rule and dumped de Klerk from power. It has
the power to grant amnesty to people who admit their crimes and
prove a political motive.
	   In its final report the commission recommended that people
guilty of abuses who did not ask for amnesty should be prosecuted.
De Klerk did not apply.

Heavy fighting in Sierra Leone's diamond region

	   FREETOWN, Sierra Leone (AP) _ Hundreds of civilians have fled
their homes in diamond-rich southeastern Sierra Leone to avoid
heavy fighting between rebel forces and a pro-government militia, a
military spokesman said Tuesday.
	   Fighting began Monday and heavy gunfire continued to echo
through the streets of Tongo Field, about 350 kilometers (220
miles) east of the capital, Freetown, the spokesman said.
	   Rebels forces and their allies from Sierra Leone's ousted
military regime were battling with a civil defense force militia
backed by West African intervention force soldiers.
	   A Nigerian-led West African coalition force, known as ECOMOG,
has been fighting on behalf of President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah since
February.
	   ECOMOG troops drove Sierra Leone's military junta from power to
clear the way for Kabbah's return to power. Kabbah himself was
ousted from power in a May 1997 coup.
	   Although Kabbah and the ECOMOG force are firmly in control of
the capital, rebels forces still control parts of the country and
have been waging a terrorist campaign against the civilian
population.
	   ECOMOG spokesman, Squadron Leader Paul Aghimen, said the latest
fighting was centered around Tongo Field and the nearby town of
Samia, in the heart of Sierra Leone's diamond belt.
	   There were no immediate reports on casualties, Aghimen said.

U.N.: economic turbulence threatens child vaccination
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ Global economic turbulence has forced many
countries to cut back vaccination programs, putting children at
increased risk, health officials said Tuesday.
	   Countries have had to make hard choices about health care after
their currencies were devalued, according to some of the 400
delegates at a two-day Children's Vaccine Initiative meeting.
	   The CVI, founded in 1990, is co-sponsored by UNICEF, the World
Health Organization, the World Bank and the Rockefeller Foundation.
	   ``Clearly Asian and African countries have been hit badly by the
crisis, but some big Latin American countries are also
threatened,'' said CVI executive secretary Bjorn Melgaard.
	   ``The question for governments is, do you plan for your future
or do you spend what you need right now?'' said Elvira Dayrit,
director of maternal and child health in the Philippines.
	   She said she had had to postpone a hepatitis B vaccination
campaign in order to complete a measles campaign.
	   The fall of Thailand's baht against the U.S. dollar caused a 15
percent cut in the health budget and initially threatened the
country's immunization program, said Supamit Chunsuttiwat, director
of the Thai communicable diseases division.
	   The government ``saw that vaccine was the most cost-effective
thing, but it wasn't easy.''
	   At least one-fifth of the world's children aren't being given
the most basic immunizations and the poorest countries still can't
afford the vaccines, WHO Director-General Gro Harlem Brundtland
told the gathering.
	   The initiative is calling for a doubling of the amount spent
worldwide on vaccination. Average spending stands at dlrs 1.80 per
person each year.

Pakistani stocks surge with U.S. lifting of some sanctions
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KARACHI, Pakistan (AP) _ The Karachi Stock Exchange soared 90.18
points in trading Tuesday, an apparent response to the decision by
President Bill Clinton to lift some sanctions against this
economically beleaguered nation.
	   The Karachi Stock Exchange ended the day at 947.76 up from the
previous day of 857.58.
	   ``The news has really boosted the stocks,'' said Sajjad Mankani,
a dealer at the BMA Capital Management Co. in Karachi.
	   ``Most blue chips have gained on buying by institutions and
speculators,'' he said.
	   On Friday, the United States announced it had decided to ease
some sanctions on Pakistan and India as a result of progress made
by the two countries in curbing their nuclear weapons programs.
	   India and Pakistan were hit with economic sanctions following
their underground nuclear explosions conducted last May.
	   Pakistan's already fragile economy was jolted by the sanctions.
	   Pakistan needs a bailout from the international lending
institutions to prevent a default on the repayment of its external
debt.
	   But India, with its robust economy, has been little affected by
the sanctions.
	   On Wednesday, Pakistan is to resume talks with the International
Monetary Fund to try to seal a bailout package worth dlrs 5
billion. The resumption of talks also has been good news for the
stock market.
	   ``The selling pressure has stopped on the back of this news and
there has been renewed buying interest from speculators,'' said
Mankani. ``The index could cross the 1,000-point mark in a day or
two.''

Canadian to challenge for Calzaghe's WBO title
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Vanderpool quotes

<TEXT>
	   CARDIFF, Wales (AP) _ Joe Calzaghe will make the third defense
of his WBO super-middleweight title against Canada's Syd Vanderpool
at the Cardiff Ice Rink on Dec. 5, promoters announced Tuesday.
	   Vanderpool, 26, was selected from a list of four candidates by
promoter Frank Warren. The others had been another Canadian Eric
Lucas, former WBC middleweight champion Keith Holmes of the United
States, Australia's Rick Thornberry and English veteran Herol
Graham.
	   Warren said Lucas and Holmes declined the offer to fight the
big-hitting Welshman, while Graham has been lined up for a shot at
the vacant British super-middleweight title.
	   Calzaghe has not fought since stopping Paraguay's Juan Carlos
Gimenez in April. He since underwent an operation on his right
wrist.
	   ``I'm ready to face anybody in the division,'' Calzaghe said.
``I know I'm the best super-middleweight in the world and I'm
looking forward to putting a string of victories together to prove
it.''
	   Vanderpool, a southpaw from Kitchener, Ontario, has won 24
fights and lost one.
	   The Canadian said he was realistic about fighting on the
champion's home turf.
	   ``I know what I have to do,'' he said. ``I know I'm not going to
get a decision if it's close. I know I have to go down there and
really beat him. At least I have to knock him down once or twice.''
	   On the same bill, South Africa's Zolani Petelo will defend his
IBF straw-weight title against England's Mickey Cantwell. Cantwell
lost previous world challenges against Jake Matlala and Eric
Jamili.
	   Petelo has a record of 17 fights, with 13 wins, two losses and
two draws. This will be his third defense of the title.

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ The European Union opened formal
membership talks Tueday with five Eastern European nations and
Cyprus, which urged the EU to push Turkey for progress in ending
the division of the Mediterranean island.
	   Opening formal membership talks with the EU, Cypriot Foreign
Minister Ioannis Kasoulides stressed his government's commitment to
the ``search of a viable and just solution.'' Reunification of the
island will also improve relations between Greece and Turkey, he
said.
	   The EU also opened membership talks with Poland, Hungary, the
Czech Republic, Slovenia and Estonia, amid anxiety about the speed
of admitting newcomers. In the case of divided Cyprus, some EU
members wondered if it should become a member at all.
	   Preliminary expansion talks began in March. The EU has not
started formal membership talks with five other candidates:
Lithuania, Latvia, Slovakia, Romania and Bulgaria.
	   Ahead of the meetings, there were complaints about the EU's
handling of its most ambitious expansion drive to date.
	   In a rare joint statement Monday, the Netherlands, Germany and
France said the inability of Greek and Turkish Cypriots to
reconcile their differences weighed heavily on their island's
membership chances.
	   They spoke of ``fundamental problems'' in the Cyprus negotiating
process, adding ``a political solution is urgently required.''
	   Sources said the three EU members fear the EU may import
Greek-Turkish rivalry and that, once inside the EU, Greek Cypriots
might hamper reunification and act to keep Turkish Cypriots out.
	   Turkey invaded the northern one-third of Cyprus in 1974,
installed a government only it recognizes and still maintains
30,000 troops there.
	   Also Monday, the leaders of Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia
complained at a meeting in Oslo that the EU has moved so slowly it
could cause instability in their region.
	   The EU has set no date for its eastward expansion. But the most
successful candidates might join as early as six years from now.
	   Lithuanian Prime Minister Gediminas Vagnorious, however, warned
of ``unnecessary tensions'' that could complicate relations with
Russia and other neighbors unless the EU accelerated its screening
of candidates.

Border police investigated for corruption
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SOFIA, Bulgaria (AP) _ In a bid to eradicate corruption in its
own ranks, Bulgaria's Interior Ministry has launched an inspection
of border police officers, officials said Tuesday.
	   Of 15 passport clearance officers scrutinized so far, 12 are
being investigated for alleged bribery. The check was conducted at
the Kapitan Andreevo crossing on Bulgarian-Turkish border, 315
kilometers (197 miles) southeast of Sofia.
	   The twelve were found to own property far beyond the purchasing
power of their average monthly salary of leva 160,000 (dlrs 96),
Vyacheslav Dimitrov, the border police chief said.
	   Reporters at the Interior Ministry were shown video footage of
villas with luxurious furniture worth tens of thousands of dollars,
which the officers under investigation acquired in the last five
years. None of them were identified.
	   ``The way of life of those people is notorious. It corrupts
young servicemen,'' said Bozhidar Popov, chief secretary of the
Interior Ministry, adding the probe will involve all 1,500
clearance officers at the country's borders.
	   Clearance technology will be revamped along European Union
standards in order to rule out loopholes for bribery.
	   Dimitrov, the border police chief, said many of his staff are
suspected of receiving bribes to allow smuggling and illegal border
crossings.
	   He said corruption may also play a role in the 1,200 annual
attempts to illegally cross the Bulgarian-Turkish border.

Homesick Brian Laudrup back in Denmark
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: CORRECTS Laudrup quit Danish national team, RECASTS. &QL; 
 &UR; By JAN M. OLSEN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) _ After decade-long career abroad,
Brian Laudrup said on Tuesday it was time to come home.
	   ``It's not a matter of money. It's a matter of emotions,'' said
Laudrup, who last week signed with FC Copenhagen for one-tenth of
his contract that he left at English Premier club Chelsea.
	   ``Something was missing. I wanted to come back to my roots.''
	   Laudrup comes to Denmark only three months after signing with
Chelsea, following stints with FC Bayern Munich, Italian
powerhouses Fiorentina and Milan, and the Glasgow Rangers.
	   Laudrup, 29, admitted that quitting the Danish national team
shortly after the World Cup to have more time with his family has
been haunting him for months.
	   FC Copenhagen will pay him a monthly salary that is 10 percent
of his 200,000-pound-a-month (dlrs 334,000) deal with the London
club, Laudrup said.
	   ``What can one use all that money for if you're not happy?'' he
said.
	   FC Copenhagen manager Flemming Oestergaard declined to disclose
the transfer sum. News reports said it was at 1 million pounds
(dlrs 1.6 million).
	   The deal also includes a clause prohibiting the Danish club from
selling Laudrup to another club without Chelsea's approval because
the English Premier League still has the rights over the Dane.
	   Laudrup urged other clubs to follow the Chelsea's example and
take more human interest in their players.
	   ``Chelsea has been just great. They finally accepted that I
wanted to go back,'' the striker said.
	   ``They showed great caliber. I hope other clubs would do the
same,'' said Laudrup, won't be able to don FC Copenhagen's jersey
immediately.
	   A heel injury will keep him off the field but he expected he
would be fit before Christmas.
	   Laudrup, who began his career with FC Brondby in 1987, joined
the Danish side the same year and scored 21 goals in 82 matches.

KLA accuses Serb police of violating cease-fire

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Russia blaming guerrillas for violence, new
police reinforcements reported coming in from Serbia; trims.

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ A spokesman for Kosovo's separatist
Albanian guerrillas on Tuesday accused Serb police of provoking
fights and said any violence committed by his side is purely in
self-defense.
	   Adem Demaci, spokesman for the Kosovo Liberation Army, did not
specifically comment on Serb accusations that two of their police
officers were kidnapped and summarily shot by the Albanian
fighters.
	   Ethnic Albanians accuse Serbs of opening fire first on a group
of their men _ and of violating a U.S.-brokered cease-fire intended
to halt hostilities between Serbs and the ethnic Albanians who make
up 90 percent of Kosovo's population.
	   Violence by both sides has increased in the past week, including
at least three incidents in which police reported killing KLA
fighters they said shot at them first.
	   The two policemen disappeared Friday, the same day Serb police
shot to death five ethnic Albanian guerrillas, including a
commander of two divisions.
	   Both slain policemen had gunshot wounds to the head, indicating
they had been killed execution-style. Serb police spokesman Bozidar
Filic said the executions showed the Kosovo Liberation Army's utter
disregard for the U.S.-sponsored cease-fire.
	   He warned Monday that unless ``international representatives''
secure two main roads running through Malisevo by Wednesday, police
will increase their patrols and ``allow safe passage'' _ indicating
a possible new Serb action.
	   The Kosovo Information Center _ which reflects views of the
Rugova camp _ suggested the Serbs were already boosting their
forces, in apparent contravention of pledges to pull reduce police
in the province. It reported 13 busloads of Serb police arriving on
Tuesday, entering Kosovo through the northwestern town of Podujevo.
There was no independent confirmation.
	   David Scheffer, the roving U.S. ambassador on war crimes issues,
viewed the bodies in Malisevo, a devastated central village, as he
toured the area with the Kosovo Diplomatic Observer Mission.
	   ``This represents one of the problems that is being experienced
here with the cease-fire, and that is that there are violations of
the cease-fire by both sides,'' Scheffer said.
	   Serb authorities suspect the killed policemen were kidnapped by
the KLA in retaliation for the shootings of the five guerrillas.
	   In Moscow, a foreign ministry spokesman said the main threat to
peace in Kosovo comes from ethnic Albanian separatists, not the
government of Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic.
	   Russia has long been sympathetic to Serbia, made up of fellow
Slavs and Orthodox Christians.
	   The KLA claims the killing of the five guerrillas violated a de
facto cease-fire in Kosovo, meant to end a nearly eight-month
crackdown on the independence-minded KLA that left hundreds dead,
most of them Albanian civilians, and hundreds of thousands
homeless. Under a 4-week-old agreement between Milosevic and U.S.
envoy Richard Holbrooke, Milosevic's forces were supposed to cease
hostilities.
	   Demaci, speaking in Pristina, sounded the same argument. He said
the violence was due to provocations by the Serbian side. The
guerrillas ``are compelled to defend themselves whenever Serb
forces try and reenter Albanian villages,'' he added.
	   Speaking about last week's encounter between U.S. mediator
Christopher Hill and KLA representatives, and Hill's presentation
of a U.S.-sponsored draft peace plan for Kosovo, Demaci called the
meeting ``a great and fruitful step forward.'' But he said the
guerrillas had no comment yet on the plan.
	   The guerrillas have grudgingly accepted the de-facto cease fire
in Kosovo that calls for a large-scale cutback of Serb police and
Yugoslav army forces in the province. But they refuse to agree to
any plan that falls short of independence, and in past comments
have rejected the draft, which calls only for a restoration of
autonomy for Kosovo, a province of Serbia, the dominant Yugoslav
republic.
	   Demaci has been long at odds with Ibrahim Rugova, the Kosovo
Albanian leader supported by foreign powers in his efforts at a
peaceful accommodation with the Serbs. In an indirect slap at
Rugova, Demaci on Tuesday criticized ``those in power (who) now
refuse to relinquish even the tiniest part of that power.''
	   He said any chance of agreement between him and Rugova ``had
passed by now.'' And he urged Rugova's people to stay out of plans
to form an independent, predominantly Albanian police force for
Kosovo, saying that role was reserved for KLA fighters.

transition of power.
	   Mahathir Mohamad, who is Asia's longest-ruling leader, also
defended the tight currency controls his government adopted in
September, saying they improved the country's battered economy.
	   ``I would like to step down as soon as possible, but I have a
responsibility to make sure that my successor can carry on where I
leave off,'' the prime minister said in a live interview on CNN
television. He said the succession will take at least a year, and
will be linked to elections planned for 1999.
	   The 72-year-old prime minister did not name any potential
replacement, saying that's up to his UMNO political party.
	   His one-time designated successor, former deputy prime minister
Anwar Ibrahim, is on trial in Kuala Lumpur on charges of sexual
misconduct and corruption. Critics say the charges are politically
motivated.
	   The trial has created an international uproar. It has caused
U.S. President Bill Clinton and Canadian Prime Minister Jean
Chretien to rule out any private meetings with Mahathir during a
worldwide summit next week in Kuala Lumpur.
	   Yet Mahathir defended the proceedings against Anwar.
	   ``There is no way that anybody can say that Malaysian courts
just favor the government,'' Mahathir said. ``They are very fair to
everyone and I am quite sure they will be fair to Anwar also.''

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Third-seeded Goran Ivanisevic of Croatia seved
eighteen aces but had to struggle through two tiebreaks to defeat
Carsten Arriens of Germany on Tuesday in the dlrs 1.1 million
Kremlin Cup.
	   The 1996 champion from Croatia never earned a single break of
serve and needed an hour and twenty minutes to prevail 7-6 (7-5),
7-6 (7-3).
	   ``If a qualifier is a good player and ... is serving decently,
it's very tough to break. But I was pretty confident at two
tiebreakers,'' Ivanisevic said. ``I never thought I could lose the
match.''
	   Lars Burgsmuller of Germany recorded the first upset, surprising
fifth-seeded Boghdan Ulihrach of the Czech Republic 6-4, 6-2.
	   Another qualifier, Raemon Sluiter of the Netherlands, eliminated
seventh-seeded Daniel Vacek of the Czech Republic, 6-2, 6-4.
	   Jan Kroslak of Slovakia, who replaced year's runner-up Petr
Korda, outplayed Oliver Gross of Germany 6-3, 6-1.

English cricketer Boycott convicted for attacking former lover
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GRASSE, France (AP) _ A French court on Tuesday convicted former
English cricket captain Geoffrey Boycott of beating up his
ex-girlfriend and gave him a three-month suspended sentence.
	   Boycott, 58, was also ordered to pay a 50,000 franc (dlrs 8,900)
fine, and symbolic damages of one franc (dlrs 0.6) to the victim,
Margaret Moore.
	   Moore, 45, had accused Boycott of blackening both her eyes and
punching her at least 20 times in the face after an argument in a
hotel in the south of France in October 1996.
	   The incident happened after the former cricketer refused to
marry Moore and move to Monaco, the court in southern France heard.
	   Boycott maintained that Moore had a tantrum and bumped her head
while he was trying to restrain her.
	   But the judge, Dominique Haumant-Daumas, said it was clear Moore
had suffered the bruising to her face as a result of being hit.
	   During the trial, Boycott was in Pakistan, where he is
commentating for the BBC.
	   Boycott's lawyers immediately appealed the decision.

Local election mirrors Israel's increasing fragmentation
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with details on first Arab city council candidate in
east Jerusalem &QL; 
 &UR; By MARK LAVIE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Accompanied by ethnic tensions and violence,
Israelis voted for mayors and local councils Tuesday in an election
that mirrored the growing fragmentation of Israel's society.
	   Ethnic and sectarian factions seemed certain to bite deep into
the support of the two main national parties, Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu's Likud and the Labor opposition, headed by
ex-Israeli army chief of staff Ehud Barak.
	   For the first time, a party representing immigrants from the
former Soviet Union ran candidates for local councils. With 900,000
immigrants, Israelis from the old Soviet Union have become Israel's
largest ethnic bloc, overtaking Israelis of Moroccan descent.
	   In the coastal town of Ashkelon, where the two ethnic groups
live side-by-side amid growing tensions, the main campaign issue
was the killing of a Russian immigrant last week. The victim
supposedly was targeted because his attackers felt he was taunting
them in Russian.
	   Most Orthodox Jews are expected to vote for parties representing
their interests. In Jerusalem, a growing ultra-Orthodox Jewish
population exercises increasing power at the ballot box.
	   In all, 682 candidates competed for 58 mayor spots, and more
than 20,000 hopefuls ran for 2,800 seats on local councils.
	   A special case was traditionally Arab east Jerusalem, the sector
Israel captured in the 1967 Mideast war and which is claimed by the
Palestinians as a future capital.
	   The Palestinian Authority has urged the city's 180,000
Palestinian residents to stay away from the polls, saying
participation in the vote would be tantamount to recognizing
Israeli annexation of east Jerusalem. Arab voters have
traditionally boycotted municipal elections in Jerusalem.
	   On Tuesday, Israeli police arrested two Palestinian Authority
activists for threatening Palestinians who tried to vote in the
city. Six others were detained for trying to shut down shops not
participating in a partial commercial strike called to protest the
election.
	   However, one Arab resident of Jerusalem, insurance agent Moussa
Aliyan, ignored the boycott, running for city council as an
independent on a social welfare list.
	   Aliyan, a resident of the Beit Safafa neighborhood, is a
newcomer to politics and began his career when he was elected
acting chairman of the neighborhood local council in October 1997.

Oil by Dutch master Van Ruisdael fetches dlrs 1.05 million
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ A landscape by Dutch old master
Jacob van Ruisdael fetched 2 million guilders (dlrs 1.05 million)
at auction, four times more than the estimate for the Amsterdam
sale.
	   The oil, pegged to sell at between 350,000 and 500,000 guilders
(dlrs 185,000 and 264,500), went under the hammer at an auction of
old master paintings Monday and triggered a bidding war between two
buyers, said Christie's spokeswoman Yvonne Ploegsma.
	   ``It's a good painting, and two people really wanted to have
it,'' she said Tuesday.
	   The painting is formally titled ``A Pollarded Willow Overhanging
a Pool with a Cornfield, a Wood, and a Church Spire Beyond.'' The
identity of the buyer was not revealed.
	   Described in the auction catalog as a ``delicately painted
landscape,'' the 26-by-34-centimeter (10-by-14-inch) oil is
dominated by a willow standing by a pond. In the distance, a church
spire juts into the sky and a farmer carrying a long pole walks
away from the tree.
	   The painting, which came from an unidentified Dutch family, was
signed by Van Ruisdael but was left undated.
	   Van Ruisdael is considered one of the greatest and most
versatile landscape artists of the late 17th century.

Primakov speaks out against ban on Communist Party
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: LEADS throughout with Primakov condemning ban, new quotes from
Zyuganov, Orthodox patriarch. &QL; 
 &UR; By VLADIMIR ISACHENKOV &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russian Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov on Tuesday
strongly opposed mounting calls to ban the Communist Party for its
failure to condemn a member's outspoken anti-Semitism.
	   ``My attitude to banning the Communist Party is sharply
negative,'' Primakov told reporters Tuesday. ``I believe that
banning the party that has the largest parliament faction may
destabilize the situation.''
	   Several prominent businessmen and politicians called for banning
the party because it refused to censure Communist lawmaker Albert
Makashov for anti-Semitic remarks. In speeches last month,
Makashov, a retired general, blamed the country's problems on
``zhidy'' or ``yids,'' a slur against Jews.
	   Communists in parliament blocked a resolution last week
condemning Makashov's comments, and several of his Commmunist
colleagues defended him in speeches this weekend celebrating the
81st anniversary of the 1917 Russian revolution, which brought the
Communist Party to power.
	   Facing mounting opposition from the Communist-dominated
parliament as the economy began collapsing this fall, Primakov
invited some prominent Communists into his government, including
First Deputy Prime Minister Yuri Maslyukov.
	   Boris Berezovsky, one of the country's richest and most powerful
businessmen, and a favorite target of Russian anti-Semites,
continued to call for the ban Tuesday.
	   ``They only call themselves Communists, but, in fact, they are
fascists,'' Berezovsky said Tuesday, according to the Interfax news
agency. ``We must convince society that the Communist Party is like
a cancerous tumor that must be cut.''
	   Communist leader Gennady Zyuganov said Tuesday that it would be
futile to try to ban the party.
	   ``The party stands for outlook and ideology, and you can't ban
it by decree, you can only fight it by using a better ideology,''
Zyuganov told reporters.
	   Any attempts to ban the party are ``bound to failure,'' he said.
	   Still, Zyuganov on Tuesday sought ways to play down the
controversy, accusing his opponents of ``being hysterical'' and
turning ``poorly-worded statements into an ethnic conflict,'' the
Interfax news agency reported.
	   Moscow Mayor Yuri Luzhkov called Makashov's remarks
``repulsive,'' but said they hardly can serve as a reason for
banning the party. ``The government would like to do that, but has
no power and will to do that,'' he said of the ban.
	   The head of the Russian Orthodox Church, Patriarch Alexy II,
added his voice Tuesday to those condemning Makashov's statements.
The church is against ``instigating enmity on ethnic or religious
grounds,'' he told reporters.
	   Russian prosecutors have been looking into Makashov's statements
for more than a month, but haven't announced any conclusions yet.
Makashov enjoys immunity from prosecution as a lawmaker, and
Communists could try to block any attempt to waive his immunity.
	   Yeltsin banned the Communist Party for one year in the early
1990s, but the party remains the country's leading opposition group
and has the largest faction in parliament's lower house, the State
Duma.

Ethnic Albanians accuse Serb police of violating Kosovo cease-fire

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Ethnic Albanian guerrillas accused
Serb police on Tuesday of provoking fights in Kosovo province and
said any violence committed by their side was purely in
self-defense.
	   The statement by Kosovo Liberation Army spokesman Adem Demaci
followed the kidnapping of two Serb police officers who were later
found dead with gunshot wounds to the head. Demaci did not
specifically comment on accusations that the KLA killed the men.
	   The KLA and the Serbs have accused each other of violating a
U.S.-brokered cease-fire intended to halt hostilities in Kosovo,
where ethnic Albanians make up 90 percent of the population. The
province is in southern Serbia, the dominant Yugoslav republic.
	   Violence by both sides has increased in the past week, including
at least three incidents in which police reported killing KLA
fighters who shot at them first.
	   Since the start of a Serb crackdown on ethnic Albanian
separatists last February, several hundred people, mostly ethnic
Albanians, have been killed, and as many as 300,000 driven from
their homes.
	   The two Serb policemen disappeared Friday, the same day Serb
police shot to death five ethnic Albanian guerrillas, including a
commander of two divisions.
	   Serb authorities suspect the killed policemen were kidnapped by
the KLA in retaliation for the shootings of the five guerrillas.
	   Demaci said Tuesday the recent violence was due to provocations
by the Serbian side to make international monitors believe it was
the KLA violating the month-long cease-fire. The guerrillas ``are
compelled to defend themselves whenever Serb forces try and reenter
Albanian villages,'' he said.
	   Demaci said the KLA has no comment yet on a U.S.-sponsored draft
peace plan for Kosovo, which U.S. mediator Christopher Hill
presented last week to the guerrillas.
	   The KLA has refused to agree to any plan that falls short of
Kosovo independence. In the past, the guerrillas have rejected the
draft, which calls only for a restoration of autonomy for Kosovo.
	   Demaci has been long at odds with Ibrahim Rugova, the Kosovo
Albanian leader supported by foreign powers in his efforts at a
peaceful accommodation with the Serbs.
	   The KLA spokesman said Tuesday that any chance of agreement
between him and Rugova ``had passed by now.'' And he urged Rugova's
people to stay out of plans to form an independent, predominantly
Albanian police force for Kosovo, saying that role was reserved for
KLA fighters.

Brittan: EU to respond to any U.S. sanctions through WTO, not
</HEADLINE>
unilaterally &QL; 
 &UR; By ANNA SATHIAH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ The European Union's Foreign Trade
Commissioner said Tuesday the EU will complain to the World Trade
Organization if the United States presses ahead with sanctions to
counter the EU's banana import regime.
	   Sir Leon Brittan said the EU, unlike the United States, would
not take any unilateral action outside the WTO. ``We will follow
the system. We are loyal to the WTO,'' he told a news conference.
	   The Commissioner reiterated the view expressed by French Foreign
Minister Hubert Vedrine on Monday that if the United States
persists in carrying out sanctions these could damage a
trans-Atlantic plan designed to prevent trade disputes between the
two sides.
	   ``I believe this dispute is not really about bananas. What has
been done has been done for political reasons, because of
Congressional pressure,'' Brittan said.
	   ``The fact that we have disputes with the U.S. is quite normal.
What is important is that the settlement of the dispute should be
under multilateral trade rules,'' Brittan stressed.
	   Over the weekend, the United States warned of punitive action if
the 15-nation EU does not change its banana trade system, which
Washington claims unfairly favors imports from former European
colonies.
	   The United States says the EU has not done enough to fall in
line with a WTO verdict last year which ruled against the EU's
favorable treatment of a number of African, Caribbean, and Pacific
region countries.
	   The EU argues it approved new import regulations to comply with
WTO demands, but the United States and Central and South American
banana producers claim its banana import regime is still
discriminatory.
	   Brittan said Washington was due to issue a preliminary list of
EU products later Tuesday on which the United States could impose
sanctions to retaliate against the banana import regime.

Zimbabwe national strike to go ahead, labor federation promises
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ANGUS SHAW &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) _ Despite pressure from the government,
the main labor federation promised to go ahead with Wednesday's
national strike in protest of a gas price increase.
	   The 67 percent increase pushed up prices of food and essential
goods by a third and sparked three days of rioting and
demonstrations last week.
	   The Zimbabwe Confederation of Trade Unions, representing most
labor organizations, said its members were demanding urgent
negotiations with the government and employers. They are seeking
price reductions and wage increases, starting with an immediate
raise of 20 percent in most sectors along with cost of living
adjustments.
	   ``We are dealing with survival here. The stomach is feeling the
pinch,'' said Morgan Tsvangirai, secretary-general of the
federation which represents more than 1 million workers.
	   ``We will take this action but we will still negotiate,'' he
told reporters.
	   Earlier Tuesday, the government said it wanted to schedule a
meeting between its own officials, the labor group and businesses
leaders on Thursday to discuss the crisis.
	   Tsvangirai said workers across the country were being asked to
stay at home Wednesday and not stage demonstrations or
anti-government protests in their towns. The government has said
its police and military will help workers get to work.
	   ``You can't kill the message by eliminating the messenger,''
Tsvangirai said.
	   On Saturday, the federation called for one-day stay-aways for a
month.
	   Tsvangirai's organization represents 90 percent of organized
labor groups and its action was likely to provoke a major showdown
with the embattled government of President Robert Mugabe.
	   Unrest over deteriorating economic conditions, government
corruption and the deployment of 6,000 Zimbabwe troops to support
Congolese President Laurent Kabila is posing the most serious
threat yet to Mugabe, who has ruled this former British colony
since it gained independence in 1980.
	   Food riots in January left six people dead after prices soared
by more than 30 percent following a 60 percent crash in the value
of the Zimbabwe currency against the U.S. dollar.
	   Two national strikes organized by the federation brought the
economy to a standstill earlier this year.
	   The government blames the gasoline increases on an 80 percent
slide in the value of the Zimbabwe currency against the U.S. dollar
in the past year.

	   PRETORIA, South Africa (AP) _ The government and a former rebel
movement in Angola have broken their peace agreement and the
country appears to be drifting back to war, a U.N. official said
Tuesday.

are facing a deadlock. From that deadlock, war is on its way,''
said Issa Diallo, the United Nations special envoy for Angola.

Russian parliament to consider START II ratification
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russian parliament leaders decided Tuesday to
speed up the long-stalled ratification of the START II arms
reduction treaty with the United States.
	   The agenda-setting council of the parliament's lower house, the
State Duma, gave parliament committees 10 days to prepare documents
for ratifying the treaty, which would halve Russian and American
nuclear arsenals to 3,500 warheads each. The U.S. Senate ratified
it in 1996.
	   Once the documents are ready, the council will meet again to
discuss its next step, Vladimir Ryzhkov, the first deputy Duma
speaker, told reporters.
	   The Duma was scheduled to discuss START II ratification last
summer, but the debate was shelved until an unspecified date in the
fall.
	   Tuesday's decision followed closed-door Duma hearings on the
government's plan to tackle the latest economic crisis, attended by
Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov and other top Cabinet members.
	   Lawmakers said afterward that First Deputy Prime Minister Yuri
Maslyukov strongly pushed for START II ratification.
	   Some Russian officials have indicated that the government hopes
that quick ratification of the START II would improve Russia's
prospects of receiving much-needed aid from the International
Monetary Fund.
	   Alexander Shokhin, the head of the moderate, pro-government Our
Home Is Russia faction said after the hearings that Cabinet
officials hinted Tuesday at a possible connection between the
treaty's ratification and the Western aid.
	   ``There was no direct link, but many lawmakers made exactly that
conclusion from the way it was presented,'' Shokhin told reporters.
	   START II was signed in 1993, and President Boris Yeltsin has
been urging parliament to ratify it. Communists and nationalists
dominating the Duma have balked, claiming that trimming and
dismantling strategic weapons would harm Russia's security and be
too expensive for the cash-strapped nation.

Report: Maradona lined up for English indoor league
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Imagine: the man who scored the ``Hand of God''
goal that helped eliminate England from the 1986 World Cup playing
soccer in England.
	   Former Argentine star Diego Maradona is being lined up to play
in a new six-a-side, 35-and-over indoor league in England, the
London Evening Standard reported Tuesday.
	   The paper said organizers of Masters League Football, due to be
launched in April 2000, were in discussions with Maradona.
	   ``We are very hopeful of getting Maradona,'' Neil Black of
Aladdin Management, one of the companies involved in the league,
was quoted as saying. ``Negotiations are quite advanced and it's a
sign of how serious we are about establishing this competition.''
	   Black said the league was also talking to Brazilian star Dunga
and former German captain Lothar Matthaeus.
	   England soccer fans will never forget Maradona scoring the
``Hand of God'' goal in Argentina's 2-1 quarterfinal victory over
England in 1986, punching the ball past English goalkeeper Peter
Shilton. He also scored the winning goal on a spectacular 50-yard
run, in which he dribbled past half England's team.
	   Maradona, 38, has been out of soccer since Aug. 1997, when,
while playing for Boca Juniors in Argentina, he tested positive for
a controlled substance for the third time in his career. Maradona,
captain of the Argentine side which won the 1986 World Cup, was
banned for 15 months after testing positive for cocaine while
playing for Italian side Napoli in 1991.
	   He received a second 15-month ban after testing positive for
drugs during the 1994 World Cup in the United States.
	   Maradona has said he is considering legal action to rescind the
drug ban he received in Italy. This follows the recent closure of
the Rome drug lab which processed his urine sample for reported
mismanagement of drug tests.

Poland celebrates 80th anniversary of independence
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photo &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ Poland launched commemorations Tuesday to
mark regaining independence in 1918, joined by presidents from
Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Romania and Ukraine.
	   As part of the commemorations, parliament approved a resolution
praising the survival of patriotism and the spirit of freedom
during the 123 years that Poland was partitioned by Austria,
Prussia and Russia.
	   President Aleksander Kwasniewski, once affiliated with the party
of ex-comunists rousted from control in elections last year by the
Solidarity bloc, said the anniversary showed how strong Poles could
be when they rose above political squabbling and worked for a
single purpose.
	   ``This is a great anniversary which summons the spirit of
agreement among different forces,'' Kwasniewski said.
	   For its part, Solidarity included in the resolution that this
same patriotism inspired the formation of the pro-democracy
Solidarity movement in 1980 and the downfall of communism nine
years later.
	   In Krakow, former president and Solidarity founder Lech Walesa
laid flowers at the tomb of Marshall Jozef Pilsudski, considered a
father of the fight for independence.
	   Attending the parliament session were World War I veterans,
diplomats and church representatives. Also attending were Greek
Prime Minister Kostas Simitis, on a two-day visit to Poland, and
his Polish counterpart Jerzy Buzek.
	   Later Tuesday, Polish officials and visiting foreign presidents
attended a gala concert at Warsaw's Grand Theater.
	   On Wednesday, the presidents will watch the changing of the
guard at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier.

Cyprus says courts will decide fate of Israeli spy suspects
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) _ Cyprus said Tuesday that the courts would
decide the fate of two Israelis detained on suspicion of spying.
	   Justice Minister Nicos Koshis said the Israelis were in police
custody and ``investigations are continuing and on their completion
it will be for the courts to decide on the future handling of the
case.''
	   His remarks came after Cypriot newspapers criticized Israeli
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for saying that Israel would
clarify the issue ``and, of course, we'll bring them home.''
	   Israel has not said whether the two people worked for its
intelligence agencies.
	   ``Such statements are provocative, arrogant and stupid and do
not promote good relations between Israel and Cyprus,'' the
pro-Israeli daily Alithia said in an editorial.
	   The right-wing daily Simerini said that Netanyahu's statement
``throws oil onto the fire.''
	   Koshis said there have been no talks between Cyprus and Israel
on any release of the two men arrested on Saturday in a rented
tourist apartment in the fishing village of Ziyi.
	   A police statement said the two were suspected of spying on the
Cypriot army and that cameras, recordings of police radio messages,
radio scanners and maps were found in the apartment.
	   Police officials said privately the two Israelis were probably
trying to collect information on the expected deployment of Russian
S-300 anti-aircraft missiles.
	   Israel is reportedly interested in the deployment of the
missiles, which have radar capable of monitoring Israeli flights
throughout the eastern Mediterranean.
	   Israel also has a military agreement with Turkey, which has
threatened to attack the missiles if they are deployed.

Pakistan, India turn to economic cooperation
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES thruout with details of talks. Adds byline. &QL; 
 &UR; By HEMA SHUKLA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ Pakistan declined to reciprocate India's
grant of trade concessions Tuesday, as yet another in a series of
negotiations between the two hostile neighbors ended with little
progress.
	   In talks aimed at boosting trade, Pakistan argued that granting
Indian most-favored-nation status would harm its nascent
industries.
	   India proposed closer trade ties as one measure to ease
tensions. It sought the same trade concessions from Pakistan that
it has granted Islamabad since the 1970s. But Pakistan, whose
economy is smaller, has held back, saying it cannot afford to lower
import duties and threaten being swamped by powerful Indian
industries.
	   It was the first time in nine years the two countries held
bilateral talks on the issue, although it has come up in broader
meetings in the context of the commitments of the World Trade
Organization.
	   As India and Pakistan reached the halfway mark in 10 days of
expert-level talks, it became increasingly clear New Delhi was
floundering in its attempt to turn the focus away from the Kashmir
territorial dispute.
	   Pakistan insists that outstanding disputes, including Kashmir,
need to be resolved before any meaningful progress can be made in
any sphere, including trade.
	   Despite such reticence, discussions were held on the possibility
of India buying electricity from Pakistan. An Indian spokesman said
the two countries would soon appoint technical teams to make
feasibility reports.
	   But niggling issues, like Pakistan's accusation that India
stalled offloading of its sugar imports, causing inconvenience to
its traders, and that India had not paid its phone bills in
Pakistan cast a cloud over the talks.
	   Last week and on Monday, the first three of six rounds of New
Delhi talks _ on water sharing, proposals for a cease-fire on a
Kashmiri battleground known as the Siachen glacier, and a
30-year-old maritime boundary dispute _ ended with little or no
progress reported.
	   On Tuesday, commerce ministry officials from the two countries
opened discussions on boosting trade.
	   The meetings wrap up on terrorism and drug trafficking on
Thursday and cultural ties on Friday.
	   India and Pakistan have fought three wars since each gained
independence from Britain in 1947, and continue to exchange shells
and bullets almost daily across Kashmir, the Himalayan territory
divided between them that both claim in its entirety. Their enmity
reached new heights of tension in May when India tested nuclear
weapons and Pakistan responded with its own tests.
	   Under international pressure following the nuclear talks, the
two countries began peace talks on Kashmir last month in the
Pakistani capital of Islamabad. The ongoing follow-up talks in New
Delhi are a test of India's argument that progress can be made on
lesser issues, improving the atmosphere to the point where progress
also can be made on Kashmir.
	   But Pakistan says nothing can move forward without a Kashmir
settlement, and that stance has overshadowed the New Delhi talks.
	   Still, analysts like Bharat Karnad, a national security expert
at New Delhi's independent Center for Policy Research, say
Tuesday's round on trade ties could yield results. Black market
trade between India and Pakistan is already brisk, Karnad said,
estimating it at dlrs 3 billion a year, indicating that ordinary
people in the two countries want close ties even if their
governments are stalemated over Kashmir.
	   The Times of India reported Tuesday that official exports from
India to Pakistan and from Pakistan to India totaled about dlrs 161
million last year.

Serb nationalists and moderates consult on new premier
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANJA LUKA, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ Rival moderate and radical
nationalist Bosnian Serb camps failed to agree on a premier
Tuesday, but the president said he hoped a compromise solution
could be reached.
	   Serb nationalists and moderates, bitter political rivals, hold
32 seats each in the parliament elected last September during
voting in the Serb half of Bosnia. Neither side thus has the
necessary majority to vote in the premier.
	   Muslim and Croat deputies hold 19 seats, but both Serb camps
want to avoid having their wartime rivals elect the government. The
nationalist bloc holds the presidency, while the moderates enjoy
support of international officials in Bosnia.
	   President Nikola Poplasen said after holding consultations with
all Serb parties Tuesday that he would try to find a compromise
solution before naming the premier-designate by the end of this
week.
	   The moderates insist that current Premier Milorad Dodik keep the
post. Dodik became premier last January. His government has
received millions of dollars of international aid after pledging to
support a peace plan for Bosnia.

Local election mirrors Israel's increasing fragmentation
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Palestinian Authority urging Arab residents of
Jerusalem to boycott the vote, one Arab running for city council. &QL; 
 &UR; AP Photos JRL101-104 &QL; 
 &UR; By MARK LAVIE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Accompanied by ethnic tensions and violence,
Israelis voted for mayors and local councils Tuesday in an election
that mirrored the growing fragmentation of their society.
	   Ethnic and sectarian factions seemed certain to bite deep into
the support of the two main national parties, Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu's Likud and the Labor opposition, headed by
former army chief of staff Ehud Barak.
	   For the first time, a party representing immigrants from the
former Soviet Union ran candidates for local councils. With 900,000
immigrants, Israelis from the old Soviet Union have become Israel's
largest ethnic bloc, overtaking Israelis of Moroccan descent.
	   In the coastal town of Ashkelon, where the two ethnic groups
live side-by-side amid growing tensions, the main campaign issue
was the killing of a Russian immigrant last week. The victim
supposedly was targeted because his attackers felt he was taunting
them in Russian.
	   Most Orthodox Jews are expected to vote for parties representing
their interests. In Jerusalem, a growing ultra-Orthodox Jewish
population exercises increasing power at the ballot box.
	   In all, 682 candidates competed for 58 mayoral positions, and
more than 20,000 hopefuls ran for 2,800 seats on local councils.
	   In east Jerusalem, which Israel captured in the 1967 Middle East
war and the Palestinians claim as a future capital, the Palestinian
Authority urged the 180,000 Palestinian residents to stay away from
the polls, saying voting would be tantamount to recognizing Israeli
annexation. Arab voters traditionally boycott municipal elections
in Jerusalem.
	   Israeli police arrested two Palestinian Authority activists
Tuesday for threatening Palestinians who tried to vote, and six
others were detained for trying to shut down shops not
participating in a partial commercial strike to protest the
election.
	   However, one Arab resident of Jerusalem, Moussa Aliyan, ignored
the boycott, becoming the first Palestinian to run for City
Council.
	   Aliyan, an insurance agent who is a resident of the Beit Safafa
neighborhood, was running as an independent on a social welfare
list. A newcomer to politics, he began his career last year when he
was elected acting chairman of the neighborhood local council.
	   Israeli police were deployed to counter election fraud and
control violence. As the campaign drew to a close, there were
incidents of arson and fist fights among rival party workers.
	   In Tel Aviv, a switchboard serving the offices of front-running
mayor candidate Ron Huldai was set on fire, cutting off telephones
at his headquarters. In one district, a firebomb was thrown at a
candidate's home, and in another the car of a volunteer was
torched.
	   Many Russian immigrants are expected to vote for Israel B'Aliya,
the immigrants' party represented by former Soviet dissident Natan
Sharansky in Netanyahu's Cabinet
	   Experts believe turnout among secular Israelis will drop below
50 percent, but immigrants and ultra-Orthodox Jews will vote in
larger numbers, giving them proportionally more power.
	   The ultra-Orthodox Agudat Israel party in Jerusalem took no
chances _ rabbis instructed their followers to vote for the party,
according to activist Baruch Cohen, 22.
	   The spiritual leader of the ultra-Orthodox group Shas, Rabbi
Ovadia Yosef, reportedly told followers in a Sabbath lecture that
those voting for the party's candidates would go to heaven.
	   Shas activists also distributed bottles of oil blessed by a
revered rabbi, Yitzhak Kadourie, a centenarian who during the
campaign was helicoptered from town to town.

Moenchengladbach fires coach after humiliating defeats
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with manager also leaving club, Bonhof's quotes &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOENCHENGLADBACH, Germany (AP) _ After conceding 15 goals in the
last two games, the Bundesliga club Borussia Moenchengladbach fired
coach Friedel Rausch on Tuesday.
	   Once one of the most glorious Bundesliga clubs with five
national titles and two UEFA Cup crowns in the 1970s,
Moenchengladbach is languishing at the bottom of the league and
faces an uphill battle to avoid relegation.
	   In its last two games, Moenchengladbach was crushed 8-2 by Bayer
Leverkusen and 7-1 by Wolfsburg.
	   Rausch, 58, was hired in April and under his guidance the club
escaped demotion in the final round last season.
	   Rainer Bonhof, a former Borussia star who won the World Cup
title with Germany in 1974, was named Rausch's successor.
	   ``The situation is critical but not fatal,'' Bonhof said. ``I am
convinced that we can manage to stay in the first division.''
	   The club also parted company with manager Rolf Ruessmann, who
has been blamed for acquiring wrong players.
	   So far this season, Moenchengladbach has won one and lost eight
of 11 games, conceding 34 goals, by far the worst defensive record
in the 18-team league.
	   When it dominated the Bundesliga 20 years ago with its
flamboyant, attacking style, Moenchengladbach produced such stars
as Bonhof, Guenter Netzer, Jupp Heynckes and Berti Vogts, who
resigned as national team coach after this summer's World Cup.
	   Bonhof worked as Vogts' assistant for several years and was in
charge of Germany's junior team after being bypassed for the job of
chief coach after Vogts' resignation.

	   Weather summary for Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands from
the National Weather Service.
	   It will be variably cloudy across the region this afternoon.
Scattered showers and an isolated thunderstorm or two will occur,
but they will be most prevalent over interior and southwest
sections of Puerto Rico.
	   High temperatures will range from the lower to mid-70s over the
mountains, 80s to around 90 degrees elsewhere. On the coastal
waters, the combination of north and northeast swells and
east-to-northeast winds of 15 to 25 mph will continue to make for
hazardous marine conditions for small boat operators.
	   A small craft advisory remains in effect for the local Atlantic
waters and the southwest Caribbean waters, while small craft should
exercise caution elsewhere.
	   A weakening cold front extending from south of Hispaniola,
northeast across the local Caribbean waters of Puerto Rico to near
St. Croix and then continuing northeast across the Atlantic will
continue drifting south-southwest through Wednesday.
	   A vigorous upper-level trough will move southeast across the
region on Wednesday, helping to enhance shower and thunderstorm
activity across the local area.
	   Thus, persons with outdoor activities planned for Veteran's Day
should closely monitor later forecasts issued by the National
Weather Service.

Bus crash kills 17 children in southwestern Colombia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) _ A bus fell off a bridge, flipped upside
down and landed in a shallow stream in rural Colombia, killing at
least 17 school children and four other passengers, authorities
said.
	   Some of the students were trapped inside and drowned after the
crash Monday morning near Suarez, 130 miles (210 kilometers)
southwest of Bogota, the Red Cross reported.
	   Fire official Lt. Eduardo Salinas said at least 17 of the dead
were students between the ages of 12 and 16. Four others were
killed and 31 were injured, some of them seriously. The driver
survived.
	   The bus, which was carrying 60 passengers, fell 6 feet (2
meters) and landed in 2 feet (0.6 meters) of water, said Salinas,
who was among the first rescue workers to reach the scene.
	   He said brake failure, a blown out tire or reckless driving were
possible causes of the accident.
	   Survivors said the driver was racing another vehicle when he
lost control.
	   ``He was competing with someone, and (the bus) bounced and
bounced until it took a big turn and went flying,'' student Andres
Gonzalez said in an interview published Tuesday in El Tiempo
newspaper. ``Then all we could feel were water and blood.''
	   Alicia Lourido de Iglesias, a Red Cross spokeswoman in the
nearby city of Cali, said eight of the children drowned when water
seeped into the flattened passenger carriage.
	   ``Many died because they couldn't get out of the water,
especially the youngest ones,'' said 16-year-old Diego Fernandez,
who believes his cousin pulled him from the bus.
	   ``I didn't want to look because there was nothing I could do,''
he told the newspaper.

Ukraine's government requests probe of tax-dodging companies
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Ukraine's Cabinet asked the chief
prosecutor's office Tuesday to investigate several hundred
companies accused of hiding their hard currency earnings abroad to
avoid paying taxes.
	   In an appeal published in the government daily Uriadovy Kurier,
the Cabinet named 363 companies, saying each of them hid at least
dlrs 100,000 in revenues in foreign bank accounts.
	   Prime Minister Valery Pustovoitenko told a Cabinet meeting
Tuesday that the estimated sum of hard currency revenues Ukrainian
exporters have failed to report to tax authorities was dlrs 836
million as of Oct. 1.
	   He said the Cabinet would continue devising means of extracting
money from debtor companies to pay off the cash-strapped country's
mounting wage arrears.
	   Employees throughout Ukraine are owed 6.5 billion hryvna (dlrs
1.9 billion) in unpaid wages, about half of which are owed by the
government.
	   Ukraine also faces a growing foreign debt, now at dlrs 10.9
billion, and was badly hit by the economic crisis in neighboring
Russia, which scared away foreign investors.
	   The Ukrainian government has chronically failed to collect
taxes, which companies avoid because they say the rates are
prohibitively high, and was slow to implement reforms needed to
boost budget revenues.
	   Instead, Pustovoitenko has launched a desperate crusade to
collect taxes from debtor companies, locking their directors in a
Cabinet room several times in previous months, and threatening to
freeze the businesses' bank accounts.
	   Pustovoitenko also has set up special tax posts at the offices
of debtor companies, seized thousands of cars from them and
launched dozens of criminal and bankruptcy cases.
	   But the measures so far have done little to improve the
situation.
	   There are about 105,000 indebted companies in Ukraine, which owe
8 billion hryvna (dlrs 2.35 billion) to the federal and regional
governments, according to tax authorities.

	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ Veteran Cedric Pioline reeled off five
of the first six points and closed Tuesday's match with an ace, but
in between was challenged briskly by hard-hitting Swedish teen-ager
Andreas Vinciguerra. The Frenchman ranked No. 16 in the world held
on to win, 6-3 and 7-5.
	   ``Pioline is the best player I've played against,'' Vinciguerra,
17, said after the match. He plays at a ``much higher tempo'' than
the juniors the Swede has faced til now.
	   Later Tuesday, American Todd Martin ousted Ivo Heuberger of
Switzerland in straight sets, 6-1 and 6-2. The day's feature match
in the 825,000-dollar Stockholm Open pitted world No. 7 Karol
Kucera of Slovakia against Australian Wayne Arthurs.
	   Seven of the world's top 20 players are contestants in the
tennis tournament that began Monday.
	   On Wednesday, top seed Pete Sampras was poised to continue his
quest to finish 1998 ranked No. 1 for a record sixth straight year.
His scheduled opponent was Jason Stoltenberg. The Australian has
lost to Sampras the four times they've played.
	   Finals are set for Sunday.
	   Pioline broke Vinciguerra's serve in game six and won the set
easily. The Frenchman demonstrated superior groundstrokes and
mastery of the court, winning points alternately with power, deft
placement and feathery vollies.
	   But Vinciguerra never gave up and in the second set he broke
Pioline's serve twice. With the score tied at 5-5, Sweden's top
young player was serving for the game and the lead when he
double-faulted.
	   That pivotal, see-saw game went to deuce six times and got the
sparse afternoon crowd of several hundred stomping the familiar
wooden floors of Kungliga Tennis Hall rhythmically for the hometown
favorite. Vinciguerra notched two aces, but also clubbed another
serve into the net and the game-losing point clear into the stands.
	   ``At that point, I was nervous,'' he admitted afterward.
	   The slender (177 cm, 66 kilos) (5'9'' and 145 lbs) teen-ager
said he's planning to play on the satellite circuit and fewer
junior matches. His performance against Pioline showed his
potential _ and also how much he has to learn.
	   ``I must serve better. Much better,'' Vinciguerra said, adding,
``I don't think he (Pioline) played so good as he can.''
	   Pioline was the third seed to advance to the second round.
Briton Tim Henman and defending champion Jonas Bjorkman of Sweden
straight-setted their opponents Monday while Thomas Enqvist, the
tournament winner in 1996 and 1995, was upset by low-ranked
Japanese Takao Suzuki in three sets.

Local election mirrors Israel's increasing fragmentation
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with quote by Arab candidate in Jerusalem &QL; 
 &UR; By MARK LAVIE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Accompanied by ethnic tensions and violence,
Israelis voted for mayors and local councils Tuesday in an election
that mirrored the growing fragmentation of Israel's society.
	   Ethnic and sectarian factions seemed certain to bite deep into
the support of the two main national parties, Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu's Likud and the Labor opposition, headed by
ex-Israeli army chief of staff Ehud Barak.
	   For the first time, a party representing immigrants from the
former Soviet Union ran candidates for local councils. With 900,000
immigrants, Israelis from the old Soviet Union have become Israel's
largest ethnic bloc, overtaking Israelis of Moroccan descent.
	   In the coastal town of Ashkelon, where the two ethnic groups
live side-by-side amid growing tensions, the main campaign issue
was the killing of a Russian immigrant last week. The victim
supposedly was targeted because his attackers felt he was taunting
them in Russian.
	   Most Orthodox Jews are expected to vote for parties representing
their interests. In Jerusalem, a growing ultra-Orthodox Jewish
population exercises increasing power at the ballot box.
	   In all, 682 candidates competed for 58 mayor spots, and more
than 20,000 hopefuls ran for 2,800 seats on local councils.
	   In traditionally Arab east Jerusalem, an Arab insurance broker
defied an election boycott called by Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat's government to protest Israeli rule in the contested
sector.
	   Moussa Aliyan, the first Arab candidate for city council, said
he wanted to show the city's 180,000 Palestinian residents that the
only way to get more classrooms, new roads and a sewage system was
to participate in local politics.
	   ``They are not getting what they are entitled to because of the
boycott,'' Aliyan said, speaking from campaign headquarters in the
Beit Safafa neighborhood. Aliyan, a newcomer to politics, said he
has received death threats in recent weeks, but was not deterred.
	   The Palestinians claim east Jerusalem, captured by Israel in the
1967 Mideast war, as a future capital. The Palestinian Authority
says voting is tantamount to recognizing Israeli rule.
	   On Tuesday, Israeli police arrested two Palestinian Authority
activists for threatening Palestinian voters. Six others were
detained for trying to shut down shops not participating in a
partial commercial strike called to protest the election.

Russian prime minister meets Finnish premier
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia and Finland discussed possible oil and gas
pipelines from Russia to western Europe during Finnish Prime
Minister Paavo Lipponen's one-day visit Tuesday, a news report
said.
	   Lipponen's talks with Russian Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov
covered customs cooperation, tariffs, possible humanitarian or
technical assistance to Russia, and the construction of gas and oil
pipelines, the ITAR-Tass news agency said.
	   Finland, which lies on Russia's northwestern border, is also
interested in buying helicopters from Russia.
	   Lipponen, whose country will host the European Union's rotating
presidency next year, said after the meetings that Finland would
put Russia's relations with the EU high on its priority list,
ITAR-Tass said.
	   Lipponen was also scheduled to meet the speakers of Russia's
upper and lower houses of parliament, Yegor Stroyev and Gennady
Seleznyov, and the leaders of various parliamentary factions,
ITAR-Tass said.

Naseem Hamed set to dump promoter, negotiate own fights
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SHEFFIELD, England (AP) _ WBO featherweight champion Prince
Naseem Hamed is ready to dump promoter Frank Warren and negotiate
his own fight deals, the fighter's brother and business manager
said Tuesday.
	   ``As from now, Naz is a free agent,'' Riath Hamed told the
Sheffield Star.
	   The unbeaten 24-year-old Hamed has reached the end of a 10-fight
contract with Warren, and his brother said he now wants to control
the money xxx himself.
	   ``Naz is exercising his right to retain his worldwide rights and
control his own destiny,'' Riath Hamed said. ``We have four years
experience in boxing management now and Naz has 17 years experience
of promoters and managers.
	   ``Whatever decisions we make will not be done on a whim. We will
be taking advice from lawyers and commercial experts.''
	   Riath Hamed claimed the move could net the fighter 50 million
pounds (dlrs 83 million) and make him one of the richest fighters
in history. He said it would ``revolutionize'' the sport by
transferring control from the promoters to the fighters and their
managers.
	   Under the arrangement, Hamed would bring in top promoters to
deliver opponents, venues and ticket promotions. But the fighter
himself would control all financial aspects, rather than the
current situation where he receives a cut of the overall purse.
	   ``This is not about greed,'' Riath Hamed said. ``It is about Naz
being paid what he is worth in the world market.''
	   Warren refused to comment on the proposals but confirmed that
Hamed's brother had been in touch with him.
	   ``Riath Hamed has asked me to meet with Naz when he returns from
holiday to discuss the future at which time I will decide what I am
going to do,'' he said.
	   Hamed scored a lackluster decision over Ireland's Wayne
McCullough on Nov. 1 in Atlantic City to extend his record to 31-0.
Hamed, who had predicted a third-round knockout, was savaged by
British boxing writers for his disappointing performance.

KLA accuses Serb police of violating cease-fire

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Serb policeman reported wounded.

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ A spokesman for Kosovo's separatist
Albanian guerrillas on Tuesday accused Serb police of provoking
fights and said any violence committed by his side is purely in
self-defense.
	   Adem Demaci, spokesman for the Kosovo Liberation Army, did not
specifically comment on Serb accusations that two of their police
officers were kidnapped and summarily shot by the Albanian
fighters.
	   Ethnic Albanians accuse Serbs of opening fire first on a group
of their men _ and of violating a U.S.-brokered cease-fire intended
to halt hostilities between Serbs and the ethnic Albanians who make
up 90 percent of Kosovo's population.
	   Violence by both sides has increased in the past week, including
at least three incidents in which police reported killing KLA
fighters they said shot at them first.
	   In the latest reported clash, the Serbian Media Center _ the
mouthpiece for the authorities _ said a Serb policeman was wounded
Tuesday by ethnic Albanian extremists in the central Drenica
region, and police returning fire killed one of the attackers.
There was no independent confirmation.

Geneva Convention surveying human rights in war

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ The International Red Cross is surveying
guerrillas, soldiers and refugees in a massive questionnaire aimed
to try to improve respect for humanitarian law in times of armed
conflicts, including those that fall outside the traditional bounds
of war, the international Red Cross said Tuesday.
	   The dlrs 1 million survey, People on War, has already been
launched in Colombia. It will also cover Bosnia, Somalia, Nigeria,
South Africa and El Salvador.
	   The project is meant to increase awareness of rules to protect
people in armed conflicts and to encourage discussion of
humanitarian law and modern battles.
	   Results of the survey, and stories of those involved, will be
published next year to mark the 50th anniversary of the Geneva
Conventions.
	   The conventions are overseen by the International Committee of
the Red Cross and are meant to guarantee protection for wounded
soldiers, prisoners of war and civilians.
	   One of their main failings is that they cover only state parties
and international wars whereas many of today's conflicts are civil
wars or involve guerrilla forces.
	   ``For the ICRC, the anniversary is an opportunity for the world
to reflect on what has occurred in the half-century since the
conventions were adopted, to take stock of the present and to
consider the future of international law and humanitarian action,''
an ICRC statement said.
	   In each country, Red Cross volunteers will ask at least 1,000
people whether international law has curbed the excesses of war and
how to improve compliance with humanitarian treaties such as the
Geneva Conventions.
	   Displaced civilians, former hostages, soldiers, guerrillas,
security detainees and medical personnel, as well as the general
public, will be targeted.
	   There will also be a parallel survey in peaceful countries,
starting with France.

Turkey warns Iraq to stop any support to Turkish Kurd rebels
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By SUZAN FRASER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ Turkey's army pushed a cross-border
crackdown on Turkish Kurd rebels in northern Iraq on Tuesday, while
Turkey's government warned Saddam Hussein to stop any support to
the guerrillas.
	   Turkish troops crossed into Iraq last week to eradicate a
roughly 500-strong group of Turkish Kurd rebels. The rebels are
believed to have fled into northern Iraq from Syria after Turkey
pressed Syria to stop allowing them haven.
	   ``There are intelligence reports that point to an increasing
support by Baghdad to the PKK,'' Deputy Prime Minister Bulent
Ecevit said Tuesday, referring to the outlawed Kurdistan Workers
Party.
	   ``Turkey is a very strong and determined country. It will take
all measures that may be necessary,'' Ecevit said, without
elaborating.
	   Reports said Turkish troops were trying to block the rebels from
escaping into Iran and Iraq-controlled territory. The military
refused to give any details.
	   Turkish newspapers have claimed that the PKK, which is fighting
for autonomy in Turkey's southeast, had opened two training camps
in Iraq and an office in Baghdad.
	   Iraq demanded Monday that Turkey pull its troops out
immediately.
	   Moving to mollify Turkey, the United States and Britain insisted
Tuesday that a U.S.-brokered peace plan between the two rival Iraqi
Kurdish factions that control northern Iraq would not lead to the
creation of a Kurdish state.
	   The accord referred to a future federal authority for the Kurds.
The mention alarmed Turkey's leaders, who oppose creation of any
Kurdish state for fear it encourage rebels in their own country.
	   ``Clearly, the co-sponsors as well as the parties believe that
key decisions on Iraq's future should be made by all the Iraqi
people together,'' Britain and the United States said in their
declaration Tuesday.
	   In return, Turkey has agreed to let international aid groups
into the region under its strict control. Turkey had hindered aid
groups from crossing into northern Iraq after some of the aid
allegedly went to the rebels.

Italy and Albania sign accord to help fight illegal immigration
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Italy and Albania pledged Tuesday to work together
to stop criminal gangs who smuggle illegal immigrants across the
Adriatic, often leaving them stranded at sea.
	   Premier Massimo D'Alema said Italian police would ``advise and
assist'' Albanian authorities in fighting organized crime. He said
the biggest aim of the accord signed with Albanian Premier Pandeli
Majko was to ``save human lives.''
	   Boat carrying would-be immigrants arrive on Italy's long
coastline from Albania or northern Africa almost on a daily basis.
	   Smugglers usually demand large fees for the voyage and then
frequently leave the immigrants at sea abroad rickety boats,
forcing them to swim ashore. Dozens of people have died trying to
reach the coast.
	   ``We are trying to hit the smugglers, not the immigrants,'' said
D'Alema.
	   Under the accord, Italy also promised to promote democracy in
Albania and help the country forge closer ties with the European
Union. Italy also agreed to encourage Italian businesses to invest
in Albania.

Chechen president demotes opponent Raduyev
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Chechnya's president on Tuesday demoted rebellious
warlord Salman Raduyev from brigadier general to private after he
was convicted of attempting a coup, news reports said.
	   Raduyev, a field commander in the 1994-96 war for independence
with Russia, also will lose the bodyguards sent by Chechen
President Aslan Maskhadov in 1997 to protect him from possible
Russian revenge attacks, the ITAR-Tass and Interfax news agencies
reported.
	   Maskhadov signed a decree Tuesday ordering the demotion and
recalling the bodyguards, Maskhadov's office said.
	   Raduyev has lately been rallying Chechnya's opposition around
the demand for Maskhadov's resignation and was tried in absentia
and sentenced last week for attempting to overthrow the Chechen
president. Raduyev remained at large and said he had no intention
of turning himself in.
	   Chechnya has been running its own affairs since Russian troops
withdrew two years ago. But no country has recognized its
independence, and Moscow insists the territory is still part of
Russia.

Flower, Johnson lead Zimbabwe to 259 against Sri Lanka
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: WILL be UPDATED with Sri Lanka innings. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   SHARJAH, United Arab Emirates (AP) _ Neil Johnson and Andy
Flower both hit half centuries and combined for a 149-run,
fourth-wicket partnership that rescued Zimbabwe from 24 for three
to a 259 total against India at the Coca Cola Trophy on Tuesday.
	   Flower made 95 off 109 balls and Johnson 72 off 106 to lift the
Africans to the highest score so far in the three-nation
competition.
	   Flower and Johnson's fourth-wicket stand broke Zimbabwe's own
previous partnership record.
	   The big innings left Zimbabwe in position to join India in
Friday's final.
	   Left-hander Flower stroked six boundaries and a six but was
stumped by keeper Romesh Kaluwitharna when he leapt out to smack
spinner Sanath Jayasuriya.
	   Johnson was run out by a direct throw from Thilan Samaraweera
after hitting two fours and a six. He, like Flower, used the
reverse sweep effectively against the bowling to pick up runs.
	   Eddo Brandes clubbed 28 from 22 balls to further help Zimbabwe's
innings.
	   Paceman Pramodaya Wickremasinghe bowled impressively for the Sri
Lankans, finishing with 3 for 28 from 10 overs, while Jayasuriya
was the most expensive, giving away 59 runs including seven wides
for his solitary wicket of Flower.

Miner killed in pit accident
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SOFIA, Bulgaria (AP) _ A miner was killed and two others were
injured in an accident at a coal mine in southwestern Bulgaria, the
state news agency BTA reported Tuesday.
	   Initial reports from the scene said a fully loaded wagon broke
loose from its restraining chain and smashed into the three men in
the Bobovdol mine, about 100 kilometers (60 miles) south of the
capital, Sofia.
	   The miner, identified as Kiril Atanasov, 45, died on the spot.
The two other miners were moved to the nearby hospital. Doctors
said that their condition is stable.
	   The accident occurred due to unsafe conditions in the mine, the
trade union Podkrepa said. No further details were immediately
available.
	   Last year six miners were killed in accidents in the same pit of
the Bobovdol mines.

<TEXT>
	   TBILISI, Georgia (AP) _ Unidentified attackers threw a grenade
in the window of a political group's headquarters Tuesday, hours
before 15 members of the group were sentenced for an assassination
attempt against Georgia's president.
	   Nearly a year after the trial began, Georgia's Supreme Court
sentenced the ``Horsemen'' group's former leader, Dzhaba Ioseliani,
to 11 years in prison. Former Deputy Security Minister Temur
Khachishvili was sentenced to 15 years in prison, and 13 other men
of the Horsemen, or Mkhedrioni, received prison terms ranging from
seven to 15 years.
	   The men were convicted for masterminding an Aug. 29, 1995, bomb
attack on the motorcade of Georgian President Eduard Shevardnadze,
in which the Georgian leader was cut by flying glass.
	   The trial began last December. Ioseliani and his colleagues, who
denied the accusations, forced delays in the trial by going on
hunger strikes and shouting in the courtroom.
	   Hours before the Supreme Court was expected to hand down the
sentences, a grenade blast seriously damaged the headquarters of
the Horsemen group. The overnight attacks injured a security guard,
said Interior Ministry spokeswoman Maya Mosidze.
	   Ioseliani, who helped Shevardnadze return to power in the former
Soviet republic in 1992, split with the president three years later
after Georgia's government outlawed the Horsemen, then an armed
militia, for alleged involvement in a number of crimes.
	   Ioseliani is one of Georgia's most enigmatic figures, a
convicted robber turned playwright and university professor, who
then became heavily enmeshed in Georgian politics.

<TEXT>
	   SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP) _ Helicopters roared into the
hills with aid for the starving on Tuesday and Central American
leaders faced the task of rebuilding after Hurricane Mitch set
their countries back 50 years.
	   The presidents of four nations appealed to lenders and creditors
for help in the aftermath of a storm that laid their economies to
waste and took an estimated 10,000 lives.
	   ``In 72 hours, we lost what we had built, little by little, in
50 years,'' Honduran President Carlos Flores Facusse said Monday
after a summit in Comalapa, 25 miles (40 kilometers) south of the
capital. He called his country's dlrs 4.2 billion debt
``unpayable.''
	   Jimmy Carter and French Prime Minister Lionel Jospin have
supported pardoning the foreign debt of countries ravaged by Mitch.
German Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer said some debts should be
forgiven for Honduras and Nicaragua, which owes dlrs 6 billion.
	   The United States has pledged dlrs 70 million and European
countries dlrs 122 million, together or individually. On Tuesday,
European Union Humanitarian Aid Commissioner Emma Bonino announced
a visit to the region to assess additional needs.
	   ``We need new financing to rebuild the country,'' said
Nicaraguan President Arnoldo Aleman. ``It's no use pardoning the
foreign debt if we don't have immediate aid.''
	   In a joint statement, the Central American leaders requested a
massive aid plan similar to the Marshall Plan, involving the World
Bank, the International Monetary Fund, the Inter-American
Development Bank and the Central American Economic Integration
Bank.
	   They also appealed for a free trade agreement with the United
States and the elimination of tariffs and duties on their exports
to the European Union.
	   Another request was for a general amnesty for illegal immigrants
to the United States from Central America.
	   Presidents Armando Calderon Sol of El Salvador and Miguel Angel
Rodriguez of Costa Rica attended the summit. Guatemalan Foreign
Minister Eduardo Stein represented President Alvaro Arzu.
	   Meanwhile, government and independent relief organizations from
around the world were rushing tons of aid Tuesday to tens of
thousands isolated in Honduras and Nicaragua.
	   Hundreds of Hondurans swarmed around three U.S. Army Chinook
helicopters that delivered 16 tons of food and medicines Monday to
a soccer field in Yoro, 80 miles (130 kilometers) north of
Tegucigalpa.
	   Like countless towns across the region, Yoro needs food and
drinking water, has had power and sewer lines knocked out and is
isolated by roads buried under landslides.
	   U.S. military engineers were helping repair roads, bridges and
water systems, and private charities sent doctors into remote
regions.
	   An estimated 6,000 people were killed in Honduras, the country
hardest hit by Mitch.
	   Most of the farm sector was destroyed, said Chiquita Brands
International, which owns or controls half of Honduras' 50,000
hectares (125,000 acres) of banana farms.
	   The company confirmed Monday it will lay off thousands of
workers with pay due to storm damage, but said it is contributing
millions to provide aid and build infrastructure.
	   The Honduran Education Ministry canceled the school year in the
seven provinces hit hardest by Mitch, which wiped out at least 315
schools.
	   Mitch also was an ``ecological disaster'' that caused
irreversible damage to delicate forests and mangrove swamps in
western Nicaragua, the environmental group Humboldt Center said.
	   El Salvador on Tuesday reported the first known case of cholera
due to Mitch. The disease had disappeared from the country two
years earlier.
	   Canada began sending troops to the area Monday. Britain said
about 1,400 Royal Navy and Royal Marines were helping with relief
efforts, and Spain reportedly will contribute dlrs 45 million.
	   In Washington, U.S. Army Secretary Louis Caldera said some 3,000
U.S. National Guard troops may join 1,000 U.S. troops already in
the region to help countries in the area recover.

Norwegian bank mulls Swedish takeover bid after merger talks

collapse &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   OSLO, Norway (AP) _ Norway's commercial Fokus bank will consider
a takeover bid by the Svenska Handelsbanken of Sweden after talks
on Fokus and two other banks on merging into Norway's largest
lender collapsed late Monday.
	   Svenska Handelsbanken has offered 70 kroner (dlrs 9.33) per
share, or about 5 billion kroner (dlrs 667 million), to buy
Trondheim-based Fokus on the condition that 90 percent of the Fokus
shareholders accept the offer and the Norwegian government grants
approval.
	   ``We feel the chances of us getting our bid through have
increased,'' Arne Maartensson, head of the Svenska Handelsbanken
concern, said in an interview with Norway's NRK radio network on
Tuesday.
	   Talks on merging Fokus, the Christiania Bank, and the
state-owned Postbanken failed when the three could not agree on a
price for using Norwegian postal service offices, which handle
Postbanken transactions. The merger plan failed after the boards of
Christiania and Fokus rejected Postbanken's offer Monday.
	   Christiania is Norway's second largest bank, three times the
size of Postbanken, which is twice as large as Fokus Bank.
Together, they would have had total assets of 300 billion kroner
(40 billion dlrs) and 6,000 employees, exceeding the current
largest bank, which is Den norske Bank.
	   Fokus Bank said its board will probably meet next week to
consider the offer from Svenska Handelsbanken.

	   LONDON (AP) _ Central American nations ravaged by Hurricane
Mitch should be granted a moratorium on international debt
payments, Britain's top treasury official said Tuesday.
	   Gordon Brown, the chancellor of the exchequer, also said Britain
was prepared to contribute 10 million pounds (dlrs 17 million) to a
proposed World Bank trust fund.
	   ``The needs of the central American countries are now being
heard throughout the world and we want to do what we can and play
our full part with the rebuilding of the economies,'' Brown said.
	   ``We are proposing to the World Bank that a new trust fund be
set up to help the central American economies and we are prepared
to contribute 10 million (pounds).
	   ``We also believe a new facility should be created to help
rebuild the shattered economies and that what we proposed for
post-conflict economies in Africa we want also done for these
economies as well.''
	   Britain was also proposing, in a letter to the World Bank,
``suspension of world debt payments so that countries are given the
best chance to rebuild,'' Brown said.
	   Earlier, 11 British aid agencies joined in a public appeal for
funds for hurricane relief in Central America.
	   The Disasters Emergency Committee Appeal for Central America
said its 11 members had already received aid requests from the
region in excess of 5 million pounds (dlrs 8.5 million).
	   The Ministry of Defense said 1,400 Royal Navy and Royal Marines
personnel were helping distribute aid in Nicaragua and Honduras.

Arafat accuses Netanyahu of wasting time over peace accord
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Israeli legislator seeking to hold debate in
parliament on the Wye peace agreement &QL; 
 &UR; By ANN S. KIM &QC;

<TEXT>
	   RAMALLAH, West Bank (AP) _ Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat on
Tuesday accused Israel of willfully wasting time in implementing
the land-for-security agreement with the Palestinians.
	   A senior Palestinian negotiator said the Palestinians might stop
fulfilling their commitments under the accord if Israel's Cabinet
did not ratify the U.S.-brokered agreement in the next few days.
	   A test of the Palestinians' intention could come Nov. 21 when
the 110-member Palestinian Central Council is to take a step toward
revoking provisions in the PLO founding charter calling for
Israel's destruction.
	   Arafat did not refer Tuesday to holding up implementation, but
sharply criticized Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu who
four times in the past two weeks postponed or broke off Cabinet
sessions during which the accord was to be ratified.
	   ``We expect that Netanyahu will waste a lot of time and he's not
going to implement the agreement honestly and quickly at all,''
Arafat said after meeting with the Duke of Kent.
	   Palestinian negotiator Hassan Asfour said that in response to
the delays by Israel, the Palestinians are considering ``whether to
put on hold its implementation of their commitments.''
	   ``Implementation cannot be unilateral. It must be mutual and
reciprocal,'' Asfour told reporters.
	   As part of the 12-week accord, Israel is to withdraw from 13
percent of the West Bank, in exchange for tougher Palestinian
measures against Islamic militants.
	   U.S. officials have said the clock began ticking on Nov. 2, or
10 days after the Oct. 23 signing of the agreement at the White
House.
	   In a first step, the Palestinians submitted a detailed
anti-terror plan. In a second stage on Nov. 6, the PLO Executive
Committee reaffirmed a letter by Arafat to U.S. President Bill
Clinton in which the Palestinian leader listed the clauses of the
PLO charter that were no longer valid.
	   In exchange, Israel was to withdraw from 2 percent of the West
Bank on Nov. 16, but Netanyahu adviser David Bar-Illan said this
week that it was likely the pullback would be delayed.
	   Netanyahu has said he cannot implement the agreement until it
has been ratified by the Cabinet and Israel's parliament. Netanyahu
has not decided whether to convene the ministers this week.
	   Israel's parliament initially was to begin debate on the Wye
agreement on Tuesday, with a vote planned for Wednesday. However,
with the Cabinet approval on hold, the parliament also postponed
its debate of the agreement.
	   In an attempt to prod the Cabinet into action, legislator Ofir
Pines of the opposition Labor Party on Tuesday submitted a proposal
to move the parliament debate back to this week.
	   Legislators will begin the discussion on Thursday, but it is
unclear when they will vote on the accord, an aide to Pines said.

Galaxy to keep Zambrano
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PASADENA, California (AP) _ Octavio Zambrano will return as
coach of the Los Angeles Galaxy despite the team's elimination one
round away from the MLS Cup, the club's new president has
announced.
	   Tim Leiweke, who replaced Danny Villanueva when Phillip Anschutz
purchased the Galaxy three weeks ago, had been considering changing
coaches after Los Angeles was eliminated by the eventual champion
Chicago Fire in the Western Conference finals.
	   Zambrano took over the Galaxy on June 10, 1997 from Lothar
Osiander, coaching the side to a 13-7 record to finish the season
16-16. This year they had a league-best 22-2-8 record but their
playoff elimination had Leiweke considering replacing him with UCLA
and United States under-23 coach coach Sigi Schmid.
	   ``Throughout the process we heard positive things about
Octavio,'' Leiweke said in a conference call with reporters.
``There was nothing steering us away from allowing him to continue
his fine work.''
	   Leiweke said the review process of all team employees included
three meetings with Zambrano, and conversations with ``a lot of
people around the league, community and sport.''
	   ``The process made us smarter and will make the Galaxy better,''
Leiweke said.
	   Leiweke joined the Galaxy following its dlrs 26 million purchase
by Anschutz Sports Enterprises, which also owns the National Hockey
League's Kings and Staples Center, an arena under construction in
downtown Los Angeles. Leiweke is also president of the Kings and
Staples Center.
	   Zambrano has been with the Galaxy since its inception in 1996,
serving as its assistant coach during its inaugural season. When it
began the 1997 season 3-9 under Lothar Osiander, Zambrano was named
interim coach and signed a two-year contract following the season.
	   Leiweke named Dan Beckerman as chief financial officer, Whit
Haskel director of marketing and Luis Garcia, director of media
relations and team services Monday.
	   He also said season ticket holders would soon be sent letters
offering refunds or credit toward 1999 season tickets for two
unplayed international matches which had been included as part of
the 1998 season ticket package.

KLA accuses Serb police of violating cease-fire

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES two Serbs reported missing, three mutilated bodies
reported found.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ A spokesman for Kosovo's separatist
Albanian guerrillas on Tuesday accused Serb police of provoking
fights and said any violence committed by his side is purely in
self-defense.
	   Adem Demaci, spokesman for the Kosovo Liberation Army, did not
specifically comment on Serb accusations that two of their police
officers were kidnapped and summarily shot by the Albanian
fighters.
	   Ethnic Albanians accuse Serbs of opening fire first on a group
of their men _ and of violating a U.S.-brokered cease-fire intended
to halt hostilities between Serbs and the ethnic Albanians who make
up 90 percent of Kosovo's population.
	   Violence by both sides has increased in the past week, including
at least three incidents in which police reported killing KLA
fighters they said shot at them first.
	   In the latest reported clash, the Serbian Media Center _ the
mouthpiece for the authorities _ said a Serb policeman was wounded
Tuesday by ethnic Albanian extremists in the central Drenica
region, and police returning fire killed one of the attackers. It
also reported two Serb villagers missing, and presumably kidnapped.
	   The Albanian Kosovo Information center reported that three
mutilated bodies of Kosovo Albanians who had gone missing in early
June had been found near Klina, 45 kilometers (28 miles) west of
Pristina. It identified the three by name.
	   None of the reports could be independently confirmed

Pakistan won't deploy nuclear weapons, if India doesn't
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By KATHY GANNON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ Pakistan promises not to deploy
nuclear weapons, if neighboring India makes a similar promise,
Foreign Minister Sartaj Aziz said Tuesday.
	   The world's newest nuclear states have a 51-year history of
tit-for-tat escalation _ such as the underground nuclear tests that
India and Pakistan conducted in May.
	   ``We are willing not to deploy nuclear weapons, if India would
do the same,'' Aziz said in an interview carried by the state-run
news agency Associated Press of Pakistan.
	   The nuclear tests generated global fears of a nuclear
confrontation on the Asian subcontinent, where India and Pakistan
have fought three wars.
	   International pressure pushed the hostile neighbors to
negotiate, but they remain far apart issues including the disputed
Kashmir region, which caused two earlier wars.
	   During the last round of bilateral talks, Aziz said Pakistan
offered India a ``framework'' to prevent the deployment of nuclear
weapons.
	   ``We proposed to India in the recent talks last month a
framework that we call strategic restraint and we hope India will
respond to that,'' he was quoted as saying. He didn't elaborate on
his proposal.
	   Both India and Pakistan possess medium and long-range ballistic
missiles capable of carrying nuclear weapons, which has exacerbated
fears of a nuclear arms race on the impoverished subcontinent.
	   Aziz detailed Pakistan's nuclear position to Pakistani agency
before Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif visits the United States next
month to meet U.S. President Bill Clinton.
	   Clinton's decision to waive some sanctions and a promise help
Pakistan get international bailout funds has eased tension with the
United States, said Aziz.
	   The United States imposed sanctions on both India and Pakistan
after the tests. Pakistan, which is dependent on international aid,
was particularly hard hit.
	   Since then Washington has been pushing Pakistan and India to
sign international nuclear treaties.
	   But Aziz warned an agreement is not at hand.
	   ``I think one should not pin too high hopes (on the U.S. visit)
because the issues are rather complex,'' he said.
	   It's likely that Pakistan will sign the Comprehensive Test Ban
Treaty after some sanctions are removed. Less likely is a ban
material that can be used to make nuclear weapons or an agreement
to sign the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty.
	   Pakistan will not sign the nonproliferation treaty unless India
also signs _ which it has refused.
	   But Aziz said there may be progress on Washington's worries
about the export of nuclear technology.
	   ``There we have no difference in principle, we have no intention
of exporting,'' he said.

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Border guards in western Ukraine detained
55 people in one day trying to cross into Slovakia illegally,
apparently hoping that massive flooding in the area would distract
authorities.
	   Guards in the Zakarpattia region captured 46 Southeast Asian
immigrants moving towards one section of the Slovak border
overnight, the State Border Guards Committee said Tuesday. Another
nine people from Southeast Asian were detained later Tuesday at a
different border stretch nearby.
	   They did not have identification papers and it was unclear what
countries they were from.
	   Heavy rains over the past week have flooded most of Zakarpattia,
a Ukrainian region that borders on Slovakia, Hungary and Romania.
The floods destroyed dozens of roads, railways and bridges, making
some areas temporarily unreachable.
	   The number of illegal immigrants from poor Asian and African
nations trying to cross into Western Europe through the former
Soviet Union, especially Ukraine and Russia, has increased
drastically in recent years.

Arafat accuses Netanyahu of wasting time over peace accord
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES in last two grafs with Israeli legislator seeking to
hold debate in parliament on the Wye peace agreement. No pickup. &QL; 
 &UR; By ANN S. KIM &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   RAMALLAH, West Bank (AP) _ Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat on
Tuesday accused Israel of willfully wasting time before
implementing the land-for-security agreement with the Palestinians.
	   A senior Palestinian negotiator said the Palestinians might stop
fulfilling their commitments under the accord if Israel's Cabinet
did not ratify the U.S.-brokered agreement in the next few days.
	   A test of the Palestinians' intention could come Nov. 21 when
the 110-member Palestinian Central Council is to take a step toward
revoking provisions in the PLO founding charter calling for
Israel's destruction.
	   Arafat did not refer Tuesday to holding up implementation, but
sharply criticized Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu who
four times in the past two weeks postponed or broke off Cabinet
sessions to ratify the accord.
	   ``We expect that Netanyahu will waste a lot of time and he's not
going to implement the agreement honestly and quickly at all,''
Arafat said after meeting with Britain's Duke of Kent.
	   Palestinian negotiator Hassan Asfour said that in response to
the delays by Israel, the Palestinians are considering ``whether to
put on hold its implementation of their commitments.''
	   ``Implementation cannot be unilateral. It must be mutual and
reciprocal,'' Asfour said.
	   As part of the 12-week accord, Israel is to withdraw from 13
percent of the West Bank, in exchange for tougher Palestinian
measures against Islamic militants.
	   U.S. officials have said the clock began ticking on Nov. 2, or
10 days after the Oct. 23 signing of the agreement at the White
House.
	   In a first step, the Palestinians submitted a detailed
antiterror plan. In a second stage on Nov. 6, the PLO Executive
Committee reaffirmed a letter by Arafat to U.S. President Bill
Clinton in which the Palestinian leader listed the clauses of the
PLO charter that were no longer valid.
	   In exchange, Israel was to withdraw from 2 percent of the West
Bank on Nov. 16, but Netanyahu adviser David Bar-Illan said this
week that it was likely the pullback would be delayed.
	   Netanyahu has said he cannot implement the agreement until it
has been ratified by the Cabinet and Israel's parliament. Netanyahu
has not decided whether to convene the ministers this week.
	   Israel's parliament initially was to begin debate Tuesday on the
Wye agreement, with a vote planned for Wednesday. However, with the
Cabinet approval on hold, the parliament also postponed its debate
of the agreement.
	   In an attempt to prod the Cabinet into action, legislator Ofir
Pines of the opposition Labor Party on Tuesday submitted a proposal
to move the parliament debate back to this week.
	   Legislators will begin the discussion on Thursday, but it is
unclear when they will vote on the accord, an aide to Pines said.

Portugal moves towards fully professional military
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ The government Tuesday revealed plans to
scrap compulsory military service, aiming to fully professionals
the armed forces within four years.
	   The plan _ which requires approval from the National Assembly,
the country's parliament _ aims to convert Portugal's 54,000-strong
Armed Forces into an organization better able to respond to its
principal modern tasks of peacekeeping and aid missions.
	   Compulsory military service has been cut back in recent years,
and now stands at four months for all males. Conscientious
objectors are permitted to avoid military training by working in
community services.
	   The plan would effect mostly the Army, as both the Navy and Air
Force are already almost fully voluntary .

West Indies captain apologizes for late arrival
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with quotes from Lara at news conference, details;
ADDS background on settlement; no pickup &QL; 
 &UR; With AP Photos JOH101-2 &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ Brian Lara, captain of the
troubled West Indies cricket team, apologized Tuesday for missing
the first match of its historic South African tour because of a pay
dispute.
	   In his first news conference since discussions with West Indies
cricket officials ended the team's hold-out, Lara refused to
discuss the settlement reached in London that persuaded them to
come.
	   The matter was ``totally confidential,'' he said.
	   ``The team is here to win the test series and the whole team,
apart from Jimmy Adams, is fit,'' he said.
	   The star batsman cut the pinky of his right hand with a bread
knife while trying to cut through a hard roll on the flight over,
Ali Bacher, head of South Africa's United Cricket Board, told
reporters.
	   The team arrived Tuesday morning in South Africa without fast
bowlers Courtney Walsh and Curtley Ambrose, who arrived late at the
airport for their flight, Bacher said.
	   The team left London Monday evening after a settlement ended the
revolt over pay. Their opening match was Wednesday in Soweto,
against a Gauteng provincial 11, and the first test begins Nov. 26
in Johannesburg.
	   Walsh and Ambrose probably would not be playing Wednesday, Lara
said.
	   The late arrival caused the team to miss Tuesday's exhibition
match in Randjiesfontein, near Johannesburg.
	   Lara said the team wanted to apologize. ``They're pretty sorry
at this time for any offense,'' he said.
	   ``We also want to thank President Mandela for the letter he sent
to us in London during the discussions. Everyone on the team
respects President Mandela tremendously and the gesture was deeply
appreciated,'' Lara said.
	   Mandela had urged that the cricketers resolve their differences.
The president sees sports as an avenue of racial healing after the
fall of white minority rule four years ago.
	   The tour is the first by the West Indies since the fall of
apartheid in South Africa, where cricket is followed mainly by
whites. The presence of the black Caribbean team is a boost to
efforts to promote the sport among South African blacks, who mostly
follow soccer.
	   Problems started last week when Lara and vice captain Carl
Hooper refused to go to South Africa, demanding better pay and
conditions. They were suspended, but reinstated as part of the
settlement Monday.
	   West Indies cricket officials said the pact calls for no
increase in the players' fees for the South Africa tour, but that
the payments would be restructured. The West Indies board promised
to try to improve pay on future tours.
	   The board agreed to recognize the role of the players union,
review player insurance coverage and the grievance and disciplinary
code and work toward a joint marketing program that would allow
players a share in revenues.
	   ``It wasn't easy yesterday,'' Bacher said earlier Tuesday. ``At
the end of the day, the board acknowledged and realized the
importance of the tour, and the players acknowledged and realized
the importance of the tour,'' he said.
	   ``Good sense triumphed in the end and I am sure you are going to
see a wonderful tour.''
	   West Indies tour manager Clive Lloyd, at the airport, described
the dispute as a ``little lull in their careers,'' referring to
Lara and Hooper.
	   ``But they are professional people and know what's expected of
them,'' he said.

Italian movie director calls for nationwide protest against UEFA
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   FLORENCE, Italy (AP) _ As Fiorentina officials were preparing to
appeal the team disqualification from the UEFA Cup, renowned movie
director and Fiorentina supporter Franco Zeffirelli called for a
nationwide protest against the decision of Europe's highest soccer
authority.
	   ``It was an unfair decision ... and all Italian soccer fans
should take a strong stand against UEFA, which took a wrong
decision,'' Zeffirelli told the Italian news agency ANSA.
	   The Florentine team, the current league leader, was kicked off
the European competition Sunday as a punsihment for the explosion
that injured a match official and caused the suspension of the
Fiorentina-Grasshoppers UEFA Cup game in Salerno last week.
	   The game was suspended at half time, with Fiorentina leading the
second-leg 2-1 and 4-2 aggregate.
	   Fiorentina officials are appealing the UEFA decision on the
grounds the team was playing on a neutral field and that the device
was thrown into the field by a Salerno resident, in hate for the
Florentine team.
	   Fiorentina's appeal is likely to be heard by UEFA this weekend.
	   ``By qualifying Grasshoppers, UEFA has sent a message to many
crazy minds: that you can embezzle a sport with a criminal act ...
Fiorentina can't be punished for the behavior of a rival fan,''
Zeffirelli told ANSA.

Artists who wrapped Reichstag announce new German project
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   OBERHAUSEN, Germany (AP) _ The artists who wrapped the Reichstag
in silvery fabric four summers ago announced Tuesday they will
return to Germany to spruce up an enormous prewar oil tank with
colorful barrels.
	   Christo and his wife, Jeanne-Claude, plan to bisect a
110-meter-tall (121-yard-tall) oil tank built in 1929 with a wall
of painted barrels. The wall of barrels _ to be called ``The Wall''
_ will be 26 meters (85 feet) tall, seven meters (23 feet) deep and
68 meters (224 feet) long, protruding on either side of the oil
tank.
	   The project is to open for viewing April 30, with a 10 mark
(dlrs 6) entrance fee.
	   ``We want to create a friendly contrast with the colorful
barrel-wall to the gloomy, depressing oil tank,'' the
Bulgarian-born Christo said at a news conference.
	   The couple's wrapping of the Reichstag drew enormous crowds in
1995. They plan to include an exhibit of drawings from that
project, as well as from a 1991 project dotting a Japanese
landscape with blue and yellow umbrellas.

Local election mirrors Israel's increasing fragmentation

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Accompanied by ethnic tensions and violence,
Israelis voted for mayors and local councils Tuesday in an election
that mirrored the growing fragmentation of their society.
	   Ethnic and sectarian factions seemed certain to bite deep into
the support of the two main national parties, Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu's Likud and the Labor opposition, headed by
former army chief of staff Ehud Barak.
	   For the first time, a party representing immigrants from the
former Soviet Union ran candidates for local councils. With 900,000
immigrants, Israelis from the old Soviet Union have become Israel's
largest ethnic bloc, overtaking Israelis of Moroccan descent.
	   In the coastal town of Ashkelon, where the two ethnic groups
live side-by-side amid growing tensions, the main campaign issue
was the killing of a Russian immigrant last week. The victim
supposedly was targeted because his attackers felt he was taunting
them in Russian.
	   In traditionally Arab east Jerusalem, meanwhile, an Arab
insurance broker defied an election boycott called by Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat's government to protest Israeli rule in the
contested sector.
	   Moussa Aliyan, the first Arab to run for City Council, said he
wanted to show the city's 180,000 Palestinian residents that the
only way to get more classrooms, new roads and a sewage system was
to participate in local politics.
	   ``They are not getting what they are entitled to because of the
boycott,'' Aliyan said, speaking from his campaign headquarters in
the Beit Safafa neighborhood.
	   Aliyan, a newcomer to politics, said he had received death
threats in recent weeks, but was not deterred from running.
	   The Palestinians claim east Jerusalem, captured by Israel in the
1967 Middle East war, as a future capital. The Palestinian
Authority says voting is tantamount to recognizing Israeli rule.
	   Israeli police arrested two Palestinian Authority activists
Tuesday for threatening Palestinians who tried to vote, and six
others were detained for trying to shut down shops not
participating in a partial commercial strike to protest the
election.
	   In all, 682 candidates competed for 58 mayoral positions, and
more than 20,000 hopefuls ran for 2,800 seats on local councils.
	   Israeli police were deployed to counter election fraud and
control violence. As the campaign drew to a close, there were
incidents of arson and fist fights among rival party workers.
	   In Tel Aviv, a switchboard serving the offices of front-running
mayor candidate Ron Huldai was set on fire, cutting off telephones
at his headquarters. In one district, a firebomb was thrown at a
candidate's home, and in another the car of a volunteer was
torched.
	   Experts believe turnout among secular Israelis will drop below
50 percent, but immigrants and ultra-Orthodox Jews will vote in
larger numbers, giving them proportionally more power.
	   Many Russian immigrants are expected to vote for Israel B'Aliya,
the immigrants' party represented by former Soviet dissident Natan
Sharansky in Netanyahu's Cabinet
	   Most Orthodox Jews are expected to vote for parties representing
their interests. In Jerusalem, a growing ultra-Orthodox Jewish
population exercises increasing power at the ballot box.
	   The ultra-Orthodox Agudat Israel party in Jerusalem took no
chances _ rabbis instructed their followers to vote for the party,
according to activist Baruch Cohen, 22.
	   The spiritual leader of the ultra-Orthodox group Shas, Rabbi
Ovadia Yosef, reportedly told followers in a Sabbath lecture that
those voting for the party's candidates would go to heaven.
	   Shas activists also distributed bottles of oil blessed by a
revered rabbi, Yitzhak Kadourie, a centenarian who during the
campaign was flown by helicopter from town to town.

Leipzig hotel cancels contract for radical rightist convention
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LEIPZIG, Germany (AP) _ A Leipzig hotel canceled a Nov. 21-22
booking for a convention of the radical rightist Republikaner
party, saying Tuesday that management was unaware who was holding
an event when they signed a contract.
	   The Republikaner Party, which booked the ``Treff'' hotel in the
eastern city of Leipzig after a hotel in central Hesse state
canceled under pressure from the environmental Greens party, said
they would challenge the contractual cancellation in court.
	   The manager of the ``Treff,'' Holm Retsch, said a convention
organizer arranged the booking without naming the clients, and that
the hotel canceled because it did not want to do business with the
Republikaner.
	   The radical rightist party was founded in 1983 by former SS
sergeant and journalist Franz Schoenhuber, who ran the party for 11
years before he was voted out as chairman in 1994.
	   Bickering between Schoenhuber and other party members has
weakened the group, which won just 1.9 percent of the national vote
in Sept. 27 elections.

Trinidad to sign aluminum smelter agreement with Norwegian company
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PORT-OF-SPAIN, Trinidad (AP) _ The government of Trinidad and
Tobago will sign agreements with Norwegian petrochemical company
Norsk Hydro on Thursday to build an aluminum smelter, Prime
Minister Basdeo Panday said.
	   Construction of the dlrs 2 billion project is expected to begin
next year, he said Monday.
	   The government has been negotiating with Norsk since January.
	   Energy officials say that the smelter will help diversity the
island's industrial base, which has been dominated by oil drilling
and processing.
	   Government officials have not revealed the terms of tax breaks,
natural gas discounts or other incentives offered to the company.

	   Cabinet ratification, which has been postponed four times in two
weeks, would finally pave the way for the implementation of the
land-for-security accord under which Israel would withdraw from 13
percent of the West Bank over 12 weeks.
	   An Israeli official said the 18 ministers would meet at 11 a.m.
(0900 gmt).
	   U.S. officials have urged Netanyahu to stick to the time table
which would require Israel to hand over 2 percent of the West Bank
on Monday.
	   Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat complained Tuesday that
Netanyahu was willfully delaying implementation.
	   ``We expect that Netanyahu will waste a lot of time and he's not
going to implement the agreement honestly and quickly at all,''
Arafat said before Israel announced the reconvening of the Cabinet.

Analysts: Saddam has no option but to keep UNSCOM out
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With Iraq-UN &QL; 
 &UR; By LEON BARKHO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraq's top political scientists, who
sometimes advise the government, agreed at a seminar Tuesday that
Iraq has no option but to stick to its decision on halting work by
U.N. weapons inspections.
	   They said it is futile to think that allowing inspections will
help Iraq achieve its goal of having the U.N. trade sanctions
lifted.
	   ``Regardless of whether it is right or wrong, Iraq has put
itself in a difficult position,'' Khalil al-Hadithi, professor of
international relations, told the seminar.
	   It was attended by 10 professors of international relations and
strategic studies and about 20 post-graduate students from the
Baghdad University.
	   The opinions _ while not all adhering to the government line _
still give strong support to Iraq's stated willingness to face
military strikes by the United States and Britain rather than allow
inspections to resume.
	   Suheil al-Fatlawi, who chairs the political science department,
said he will send a report summarizing the opinions to the Iraqi
leadership later Tuesday.
	   The professors have held similar meetings and given their
opinions during Iraq's previous crises with the United Nations over
weapons inspections.
	   The current row is over Iraq's Oct. 31 decision to halt all work
by the United Nations Special Commission, which is responsible for
eliminating Iraq's chemical and biological weapons and long range
missiles.
	   Iraq's official position is that it will unchain UNSCOM only if
the U.N. Security Council gives a timetable for lifting the
sanctions imposed after Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
	   The invasion led to the 1991 Gulf War and a cease-fire was
called after Iraq agreed to comply with several U.N. Security
Council resolutions, one of which was to cooperate with UNSCOM.
	   But the political analysts said the resolutions are heavily
weighed against Iraq.
	   ``A careful reading of the resolutions will show they are like a
peace treaty between the victor and the vanquished. In them, the
stamp of the victor is clear,'' said al-Hadithi.
	   Even if Iraq was declared clear of all illegal weapons, there
were other resolutions that ``the victors will try to force us to
implement.''
	   ``Now they are talking about Kuwaiti prisoners and human rights.
It is a vicious circle that has a beginning but not an end,'' he
said.
	   One professor, Abdulqadir Mohammed, said he believed the
government may make some concessions if it became clear that
military strikes were imminent.
	   Asked whether Iraq would accept the strikes, Mohammed said:
``There will be a way out if or when the crisis reaches its peak.''
	   In surprisingly candid remarks in this country where people
rarely criticize the government publicly, Mohammed said Iraqi
diplomats still haven't figured out how to deal with the United
States.
	   ``It is a state we do not know how to conduct a dialogue with
and do not understand what it wants from us,'' he said.

Four Dutch marines injured in helicopter fire
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DEN HELDER, Netherlands (AP) _ Four Dutch marines were injured
Tuesday when a small explosion sparked a fire in a helicopter as it
took off from a naval base.
	   One of the marines was seriously injured in the incident and the
remaining three were left with minor injuries, Dutch Navy spokesman
Silvain Benistant said.
	   The identities of the marines were not released, nor were
details of their injuries. Two of the injured were being treated in
the naval base's hospital.
	   The explosion took place near the gear box of the main rotor of
the Lynx helicopter as it was taking off from the De Kooij naval
airbase in this town 50 kilometers (31.5 miles) north of the Dutch
capital Amsterdam.
	   Firefighters took two minutes to put out the blaze and free the
four men aboard. The cause of the explosion was being investigated,
Benistant said.

Cyprus says courts will decide fate of Israeli spy suspects
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) _ Cyprus' justice minister said Tuesday
that the courts would decide the fate of two Israelis detained on
suspicion of spying.
	   Nicos Koshis' statement came after Cypriot newspapers criticized
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for saying that Israel
would clear up the matter ``and, of course, we'll bring them
home.''
	   Israel has not said whether the two men worked for its
intelligence agencies.
	   ``Such statements are provocative, arrogant and stupid and do
not promote good relations between Israel and Cyprus,'' the
pro-Israeli daily Alithia said in an editorial.
	   The right-wing daily Simerini said that Netanyahu's statement
``throws oil onto the fire.''
	   Koshis said the Israelis were in police custody and once the
investigation was complete, ``it will be for the courts to decide
on the future handling of the case.''
	   He said there have been no talks between Cyprus and Israel on
releasing the two men, who were arrested Saturday in a rented
tourist apartment in the fishing village of Ziyi.
	   A police statement said the two were suspected of spying on the
Cypriot army and that cameras, recordings of police radio messages,
radio scanners and maps were found in the apartment.
	   Police officials said privately the two Israelis were probably
trying to collect information on the expected deployment of Russian
S-300 anti-aircraft missiles.
	   Israel reportedly is interested in the missiles, which have
radar capable of monitoring Israeli flights throughout the eastern
Mediterranean.
	   Israel has a military agreement with Turkey, which has
threatened to take action if they are deployed in Cyprus.

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ Two members of Germany's powerful
central bank are stepping down effective Dec. 31, a Bundesbank
spokesman said Tuesday.
	   In keeping with protocol, President Roman Herzog has approved
the resignations of Helmut Hesse and Olaf Sievert. Both said they
intend to devote time to academics, according to a Bundesbank
statement.
	   No successors have been named, and the central bank spokesman
declined to comment on candidates.
	   Hesse heads the regional central bank of Bremen, Saxony and
Saxony-Anhalt, and Sievert runs the regional central bank of Saxony
and Thuringia.

 &UR; EDS: CORRECTS opponent to Sri Lanka in lead; WILL be UPDATED with
Sri Lanka innings. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   SHARJAH, United Arab Emirates (AP) _ Neil Johnson and Andy
Flower both hit half centuries and combined for a 149-run,
fourth-wicket partnership that rescued Zimbabwe from 24 for three
to a 259 total against Sri Lanka at the Coca Cola Trophy on
Tuesday.
	   Flower made 95 off 109 balls and Johnson 72 off 106 to lift the
Africans to the highest score so far in the three-nation
competition.
	   Flower and Johnson's fourth-wicket stand broke Zimbabwe's own
previous partnership record.
	   The big innings left Zimbabwe in position to join India in
Friday's final.
	   Left-hander Flower stroked six boundaries and a six but was
stumped by keeper Romesh Kaluwitharna when he leapt out to smack
spinner Sanath Jayasuriya.
	   Johnson was run out by a direct throw from Thilan Samaraweera
after hitting two fours and a six. He, like Flower, used the
reverse sweep effectively against the bowling to pick up runs.
	   Eddo Brandes clubbed 28 from 22 balls to further help Zimbabwe's
innings.
	   Paceman Pramodaya Wickremasinghe bowled impressively for the Sri
Lankans, finishing with 3 for 28 from 10 overs, while Jayasuriya
was the most expensive, giving away 59 runs including seven wides
for his solitary wicket of Flower.

	   OSWIECIM, Poland (AP) _ For the first time since the Holocaust,
Jewish prayers echoed in this run-down synagogue Tuesday at the
rededication of the only remaining Jewish temple near the former
Nazi death camp Auschwitz.
	   ``Our goal is to recreate a permanent structure symbolizing
Jewish life in a place which for too many years has only
represented Jewish death,'' said Fred Schwartz, founder of the New
York-based Auschwitz Jewish Center Foundation, which sponsored the
restoration of the Lomdei Mishnayot Synagogue.
	   The synagogue, built at the turn of the century, was used until
1939, when Nazi troops entered Poland. After World War II, it was
seized by the communists.
	   In March, Polish authorities returned the property to the Jewish
community, making it the first building to be returned under a 1997
government restitution program for former Jewish religious
properties.
	   The foundation is collecting funds to renovate the synagogue,
which until recently was used as a carpet warehouse, and set up an
adjacent museum.
	   Schwartz expects restoration work to take up to two years and
cost some dlrs 10 million.
	   Before the war, 7,000 Jews worshipped at a dozen synagogues in
Oswiecim, a town of 11,000 people in southern Poland, where the
Nazis built the Auschwitz-Birkenau concentration camp during World
War II.
	   The Nazis destroyed the other 11 synagogues in the town, which
now has only one Jewish resident, an elderly man.
	   A former resident, retired real estate broker Hirsch Kornreich,
came back for Tuesday's ceremony from his home in New York.
	   ``It breaks my heart to come to this place,'' said Kornreich,
the only survivor from a 144-member family that perished in
Auschwitz.
	   ``I used to pray here as a child. My father used to pray here,
my grandfather used to pray here and my great grandfather did,'' he
said in a mixture of English and Polish. ``I'm a bridge between
what it was like and the future.''
	   Kornreich used to live in an adjoining building, which is to
become a museum and cultural center for the study of Jewish history
in Poland.
	   A Jewish leader in Warsaw, journalist Konstanty Gebert, welcomed
the rededication.
	   ``Thanks to this place Jews will not feel as strangers in a
strange city,'' he told The Associated Press.
	   Polish, Israeli and American officials looked on as Rabbi Haskel
Besser said prayers in Yiddish and then nailed traditional mezuzas
to the door frames.
	   U.S. Ambassador Daniel Fried and Israeli Ambassador Yigal
Antebi, praised the project and spoke of 700-year-long history of
Jewish and Polish cohabitation in Oswiecim.
	   U.S Senator Frank Lautenberg, praised Poland's efforts to revive
Jewish life after the fall of the Iron Curtain.
	   More than 1.5 million people, 90 percent of them Jewish,
perished in gas chambers or died of starvation and diseases at the
Auschwitz-Birkenau camp complex, the most notorious Nazi death
factory.

	   Palestinian negotiator Hassan Asfour said the Palestinians might
stop fulfilling their commitments under the accord if Israel's
Cabinet did not ratify the U.S.-brokered agreement in the next few
days. ``Implementation cannot be unilateral. It must be mutual and
reciprocal,'' Asfour told reporters.
	   In the past two weeks, Netanyahu postponed the Cabinet debate
three times, saying he needed more clarifications from the
Palestinians about their campaign against Islamic militants.
	   Last Friday, the ministers had just begun their second day of
meetings on the peace accord when two members of the Islamic Jihad
group blew up their rigged car in a Jerusalem market, killing
themselves and wounding 21 Israeli shoppers.
	   In response, the Cabinet dispersed and Netanyahu said he would
not reconvene the ministers until the Palestinian Authority
outlined how it would prevent attacks against Israelis in the
future.
	   Netanyahu said in a statement Tuesday that he decided to
reconvene the Cabinet after ``receiving reports that the
Palestinian Authority decided to take practical steps against
Palestinian terror groups and their infrastructure.''

Estonians cut water supply to Russian border town
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TALLINN, Estonia (AP) _ Estonian authorities on Tuesday turned
off the sole water supply to a Russian border city because
Ivangorod municipal authorities had not paid water bills totaling
more than dlrs 1 million.
	   Officials in the Estonian city of Narva, where the region's main
water utility is located, said that non-payment of Ivangorod's
water bill has been an ongoing problem that has been exacerbated by
Russia's economic crisis.
	   The cash-strapped Russian town of 12,000 residents says it
doesn't have the money to pay.
	   Estonia's government last year paid part of Ivangorod's water
bill.
	   Government spokesman Daniel Vaarik said the problem involved
Estonian as well as municipal governments and also privately owned
companies, which made finding a solution more difficult.
	   ``This is a serious situation and very complicated to solve,''
he told The Associated Press. ``But someone has to pay the bill or
the Narva Water Company, which is partly private, will go bankrupt.
That would be a huge problem for Narva and all of Estonia.''
	   Narva and Ivangorod, about 120 miles (200 kilometers) east of
Tallinn, have had a common water system since before World War II,
when Ivangorod was part of Estonia. After Estonia was annexed by
the Soviet Union in 1940, their infrastructures became more
intertwined.
	   With the Soviet collapse in 1991, Ivangorod fell under the
jurisdiction of Russia and Narva remained part of Estonia, which is
considered the most successful free-market reformer of the 15
former Soviet republics.
	   Under Russia, Ivangorod's economy has fallen into near-ruin,
while Narva's economy has thrived by comparison.

Muslim parents convicted of abducting ``too Norwegian'' daughter
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DOUG MELLGREN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   OSLO, Norway (AP) _ In a trial about clashing cultures as well
as laws, a Muslim couple from Morocco was convicted Tuesday of
abducting their daughter because they felt she had become too
Norwegian.
	   The daughter, identified only as 19-year-old Nadia, grew up
mostly in Norway and like many Norwegian teens liked to go out
dancing and drinking alcohol _ in violation of Islamic religious
teachings _ with her friends.
	   In trial at Oslo City Court, she claimed her parents found such
behavior appalling, and forcibly brought her to Morocco in hopes of
changing her views.
	   The trial was avidly watched by native Norwegians and immigrants
alike. It was seen as setting a legal benchmark for tolerance of
traditional customs and religious beliefs that can conflict with
what activities and attitudes commonly accepted in liberal Norway.
	   In its ruling, the Oslo court found the parents guilty of
abducting their daughter. It sentenced the father to 15 months and
the mother to one year in prison, plus fines and court costs
totaling 75,000 kroner (dlrs 10,000).
	   However, the court suspended the jail sentences. The public
prosecutor who filed the case said sending the parents to jail
would make family reconciliation more difficult.
	   During the trial, Nadia testified she was drugged, handcuffed
and driven in a van for five days before arriving in Morocco in
August 1997.
	   ``Mama said the house was on fire, and that we had to get out.
She helped me put on clothes and make it down the stairs,'' Nadia
testified. ``When I looked around, there was no fire. I shouted for
help once, but then mama put her hand in front of my mouth and
pushed me in the van.''
	   Norwegian officials discovered what happened after Nadia's
employer at a grocery store reported her missing when she failed to
show up at work. Norway's ambassador to Morocco, Arne B.
Honningstad, managed to track her down in her parents' hometown of
Nador.
	   In court, he said Nadia told him by phone that she was being
held against her will. He spoke with her parents on her behalf.
	   Honningstad quoted Nadia's mother as screaming, ``All Norwegian
women are whores. I don't want Nadia to be Norwegian,'' according
to an account of the trial published by the Oslo newspaper
Aftenposten.
	   After a month, Nadia's father gave in and allowed his daughter
to return to Norway, where she went into hiding and would only
appear in court. Norwegian police then charged the parents with
kidnapping.
	   The parents claimed Nadia had travelled with them willingly.
	   ``There were never any problems between me and Nadia about
religion or her lifestyle,'' the father said in court.
	   The parents said they would appeal the ruling to a higher court.
Neither their names nor Nadia's last name were reported, in keeping
with Norwegian practice.

Islamic experts pleased with human rights seminar

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ A two-day conference on Islam and human rights
marks a start in efforts to promote greater understanding between
Muslim and Western ideals, participants said Tuesday.
	   ``There is no incompatibility between Islam and human rights,''
said Sahib ben Cheikh, an Algerian scholar and mufti _ interpreter
of religious law _ of Marseille, France.
	   ``The dream is to introduce Islam as a heritage of all
humanity,'' ben Cheikh said at the close of the session on Islamic
perspectives on the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.
	   The meeting, which grouped 20 experts of Islamic law, was
criticized by some human rights organizations because they had no
chance to participate.
	   U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights, Mary Robinson, convened
the meeting in a bid to break down cultural barriers. It was
decided that only selected scholars should be allowed to speak in
order to avoid polemics.
	   U.N. officials say they hope to have follow up seminars with
wider participation.
	   ``The fact that there has not been an exchange where non-Muslims
could put questions to these experts is very regrettable,'' said
ben Cheikh.
	   Kamel al-Sharif, secretary general of the International Islamic
Council for Daw'a (religious calling) and Relief, said he agreed
with Mrs. Robinson that it was better to have a closed meeting of
experts first.
	   ``This is the beginning of a process, not the end of it,'' said
al-Sharif.

peace accord Wednesday. No pickup. Cabinet to meet 0900 GMT
Wednesday. &QL;

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has won new
assurances from the Palestinians about their antiterror campaign,
and will convene his Cabinet Wednesday to resume debate on the Wye
peace accord, the government announced.
	   Cabinet ratification, which has been postponed four times in two
weeks, would finally pave the way for the implementation of the
land-for-security accord under which Israel would withdraw from 13
percent of the West Bank over 12 weeks.
	   An Israeli official said Tuesday that the 18 ministers would
meet Wednesday morning.
	   U.S. officials have urged Netanyahu to stick to the timetable
that requires Israel to hand over 2 percent of the West Bank on
Monday.
	   Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat complained Tuesday that
Netanyahu was willfully delaying implementation.
	   ``We expect that Netanyahu will waste a lot of time and he's not
going to implement the agreement honestly and quickly at all,''
Arafat said before Israel announced the reconvening of the Cabinet.
	   Palestinian negotiator Hassan Asfour said the Palestinians might
stop fulfilling their commitments under the accord if Israel's
Cabinet did not ratify the U.S.-brokered agreement in the next few
days. ``Implementation cannot be unilateral. It must be mutual and
reciprocal,'' Asfour told reporters.
	   In the past two weeks, Netanyahu postponed the Cabinet debate
three times, saying he needed more clarifications from the
Palestinians about their campaign against Islamic militants.
	   Last Friday, the ministers had just begun their second day of
meetings on the peace accord when two members of the Islamic Jihad
group blew up their rigged car in a Jerusalem market, killing
themselves and wounding 21 Israeli shoppers.
	   In response, the Cabinet dispersed and Netanyahu said he would
not reconvene the ministers until the Palestinian Authority
outlined how it would prevent future attacks against Israelis.
	   Netanyahu said in a statement Tuesday that he decided to
reconvene the Cabinet after ``receiving reports that the
Palestinian Authority decided to take practical steps against
Palestinian terror groups and their infrastructure.''

Heavy fighting in Sierra Leone's diamond region
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   FREETOWN, Sierra Leone (AP) _ Hundreds of civilians have fled
their homes in diamond-rich southeastern Sierra Leone to avoid
heavy fighting between rebel forces and a pro-government militia, a
military spokesman said Tuesday.
	   Fighting began Monday and heavy gunfire continued to echo
through the streets of Tongo Field, about 350 kilometers (220
miles) east of the capital, Freetown, the spokesman said.
	   Rebels forces and their allies from Sierra Leone's ousted
military regime were battling with a civil defense force militia
backed by West African intervention force soldiers.
	   A Nigerian-led West African coalition force, known as ECOMOG,
has been fighting on behalf of President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah since
February.
	   ECOMOG troops drove Sierra Leone's military junta from power to
clear the way for Kabbah's return to power. Kabbah himself was
ousted from power in a May 1997 coup.
	   Although Kabbah and the ECOMOG force are firmly in control of
the capital, rebels forces still control parts of the country and
have been waging a terrorist campaign against the civilian
population.
	   ECOMOG spokesman, Squadron Leader Paul Aghimen, said the latest
fighting was centered around Tongo Field and the nearby town of
Samia, in the heart of Sierra Leone's diamond belt.
	   There were no immediate reports on casualties, Aghimen said.

Muslim parents convicted of abducting ``too Norwegian'' daughter

	   OSLO, Norway (AP) _ In a trial about clashing cultures as well
as laws, a Muslim couple from Morocco was convicted Tuesday of
abducting their daughter because they felt she had become too
Norwegian.
	   The daughter, identified only as 19-year-old Nadia, grew up

Belgrade police impound all copies of Dnevni Telegraf

control, opposition leader starting legal proceedings against
government daily. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ In an ongoing purge of Serbia's
independent media, the government Tuesday took control of a popular
radio station, and police impounded all 100,000 copies of a leading
daily.
	   Radio Index, a student-run Belgrade radio, was first shut down
last month for allegedly broadcasting without a license. On
Tuesday, the Belgrade university board, complying with government
demands, announced it was replacing the station's team of editors,
B-92 radio reported.
	   The editor-in-chief of Radio Index, Nenad Cekic, who already
faces criminal charges, disputed the board's decision. He said the
state-run body had given up any editorial control over the radio a
long time ago.
	   Radio Index later issued a formal statement saying they reject
the decision.
	   Earlier, police raided the headquarters of Dnevni Telegraf daily
and confiscated its Tuesday edition. The action came after the
daily failed to pay a fine of 1.2 million dinars (dlrs 120,000) to
the state for allegedly breaching a restrictive media law.
	   Despite the crackdown, the owner of Dnevni Telegraf vowed to
keep publishing.
	   The moves against the two media, known for their criticism of
President Slobodan Milosevic's autocratic regime, are the latest in
a series of crackdowns against Serbia's fledgling independent media
following the adoption of the restrictive information law last
month.
	   A Belgrade district court ruled Sunday that Dnevni Telegraf
(Daily Telegraph) chiefs would have to pay the steep amount for
``publishing information inciting destruction of the constitutional
order.''
	   Dnevni Telegraf owner and chief editor Slavko Curuvija said he
would continue printing his newspaper in Bulgaria, Hungary, Bosnia
or the Yugoslav republic of Montenegro.
	   ``They will have to keep their policemen on all these countries'
borders if they want to continue confiscating my paper,'' Curuvija
said.
	   Responding to the crackdown, opposition leader Zoran Djindjic
said Tuesday his Democratic Party had initiated legal proceedings
against the state-run Politika daily for publishing ``lies and
slander'' about Djindjic.

	   ABUJA, Nigeria (AP) _ The family of Nigeria's late dictator,
Gen. Sani Abacha, has handed back to the government more than dlrs
750 million in state funds illegally amassed by the former leader,
a government spokesman said.
	   The money has been deposited into a special account at the
Central Bank of Nigeria, government spokesman Mohammed Haruna told
reporters Monday.
	   During his five-year military dictatorship, Abacha diverted
hundreds of millions of dollars in government funds to his personal
accounts. Since his death in June, Abacha's family has returned
vast sums of money.
	   The government has put pressure on family members to return the
money, confiscating the passports of Abacha's wife and some of his
children, and keeping some family members under surveillance
	   Others in Abacha's government also allegedly siphoned money from
the state to amass personal fortunes. Nigeria's former finance
minister, Anthony Ani, said Abacha's national security adviser
Ismail Gwarzo channeled about dlrs 1.3 billion worth of foreign
reserves into private accounts.
	   Although accustomed to military rule and conflict, Nigeria
suffered enormously under Abacha, whose leadership was marked by
divisive policies, endemic and institutionalized corruption and
brutal repression.
	   Abacha was replaced by another military leader, Gen. Abdulsalami
Abubakar, who has vowed to hand power over to an elected civilian
government. Abubakar has been working to free political prisoners
and redress the financial mismanagement that marked Abacha's
tenure.

	   TURIN, Italy (AP) _ League champion Juventus will start a Croat
defender as centerforward and some players from its junior teams in
Wednesday's Italian Cup round to make up for a streak of injuries
which have sidelined key players and severely cut an original
23-man roster.
	   Igor Tudor, who usually teams with Uruguayan Paolo Montero and
Italian veteran Ciro Ferrara in defense, will lead La Juve offense
in the third-round second-leg game of the Italian Cup against
low-ranked Venezia.
	   Coach Marcello Lippi said Tuesday that Tudor, who's tall and
good in headers, will team in front with Uruguayan forward Daniel
Fonseca and with 18-year-old Marco Rigoni, making his debut on the
major team.
	   La Juve, which will be playing Venezia on the road following a
disappointing 1-1 draw at home, will be without star-forward
Alessandro Del Piero, sidelined through March with a bad knee
injury, French midfielder Didier Deschamps, striker Filippo
Inzaghi, No.1 keeper Angelo Peruzzi, defender Mark Iuliano and
midfielders Antonio Conte and Alessio Tacchinardi.
	   Internazionale of Milan will miss its Brazilian superstar
Ronaldo in Wednesday's match against underdog Castel di Sangro but
will start Italian veteran star Roberto Baggio, recovered from a
knee tendinitis.
	   Baggio, signed by Inter in the offseason, has played a few games
with his new team.
	   Inter, which tied AC Milan 1-1 Sunday following three
consecutive losses in league games, starts from a 1-0 first-leg
lead against Castel di Sangro, a third-division team.
	   Ronaldo, repeatedly off and on the team in his troubled season
start, is sidelined with a light left knee injury. However team
doctors said he will be on the starting lineup in Sunday's league
match against Sampdoria.
	   Other Italian Cup games Wednesday, with the qualifiers moving
into the quarterfinals, include Parma vs. Bari, AC Milan vs Lazio,
Bologna vs. Sampdoria and Vicenza vs. Udinese.
	   League leader Fiorentina played second-division Lecce Tuesday
night.
	   AS Roma will take on Atalanta of Bergamo in the game completing
the third round Thursday.

German defense minister warns of new violence in Kosovo
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Germany's defense minister said Tuesday he
fears fresh warfare in Kosovo unless international pressure is kept
up on Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic and ethnic Albanian
rebels to honor an Oct. 12 peace deal for the province.
	   Rudolf Scharping cited signs that the current truce was being
used for ``preparations for new military actions'' after the
winter. Speaking during a debate in parliament, he did not
elaborate.
	   ``There is only a very narrow window for a political solution,''
he said.
	   He said it would be unacceptable for unarmed peace monitors or a
military force being set up to intervene if the observers face
danger because of a lack of diplomatic pressure on both sides in
the conflict.
	   The deal calls for up to 2,000 international observers to go to
Kosovo to make sure Milosevic reduces security forces in Kosovo and
stops attacks on civilians.
	   Germany has contributed observers and is also offering soldiers
for the rapid intervention force, to be based in neighboring
Macedonia.

French army painters sanitized WWI horrors for public consumption
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MARILYN AUGUST &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Hand-to-hand combat in trenches piled with German
cadavers _ but not French ones. Soldiers looting the rubble of
cities reduced to ruin _ but only Germans. A valorous unarmed
French soldier overpowering his knife-wielding enemy.
	   Those images are among 110 artworks that go on display Wednesday
for the first time since they were created by French World War I
military artists.
	   The works have been taken out of storage to commemorate
Wednesday's 80th anniversary of the end of the Great War.
	   The artists were sent to the front to paint what they wanted,
but they produced some very sanitized results.
	   ``The most horrific scenes were censored, not by the military,
but by the artists themselves,'' said Frederick Lacaille, curator
of ``Peindre La Grande Guerre'' (Painting the Great War) at the
Army Museum in Paris.
	   He said the purpose of sending the best-known artists of the day
to the front lines _ most were too old to fight _ was to bring home
glorified images of war to families of soldiers stuck in the
trenches.
	   ``The paintings always depicted dead Germans, never French,''
Lacaille said.
	   The works also had another purpose: they toured the United
States in 1916 as part of a French propaganda campaign to convince
the Americans to join the war.
	   The artworks were the only war images available in color _
photography at the time was mostly in black and white.
	   The French tradition of glorifying military operations on canvas
dates back to King Louis XIV, who decorated his royal residences
with huge murals portraying French valor in battle.
	   ``The paintings of the Great War are the last examples of this
tradition,'' Lacaille said Tuesday. ``After World War I,
photography and film took over and it was no longer possible to
censor the horrors of war.''
	   Among the works on display are paintings by Charles-Jules Duvent
showing the Reims cathedral aflame and the city of Arras reduced to
rubble.
	   A generation of French children grew up on the images. They
include soldiers reading mail in a country church, a military
funeral, women nursing the wounded and ashen-faced, bandaged
soldiers peering out of the trenches at twilight.
	   The works were widely published in newspapers, especially the
popular L'Illustration, a Life Magazine-style weekly.
	   Military officials would exhibit the originals, which range in
size from small pastels to large oils, at army headquarters in
Paris. Editors were then invited to pick whichever ones they wanted
to reproduce.
	   The show runs through March 7.

	   TURIN, Italy (AP) _ League champion Juventus will start a Croat
defender as centerforward and some players from its junior teams in
Wednesday's Italian Cup round to make up for a streak of injuries
which have sidelined key players and severely cut an original

Iraq appeals to Arabs as impasse over U.N. inspections drags on
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: AMs; UPDATES with quotes, details
 &UR; AP Photos BAG101-103
 &UR; By EILEEN ALT POWELL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Baghdad is reaching out for Arab support in
its dispute with U.N. weapons inspectors in hopes of leaving the
United States isolated in its campaign to rally backing for the use
of force against Iraq.
	   Iraq's foreign minister, Mohammed Saeed al-Sahhaf, chose an Arab
television station _ Qatar's Al-Jazeera _ for his first interview
on the dispute. The crisis began Oct. 31 when Iraq halted
cooperation with U.N. weapons inspectors.
	   Al-Sahhaf warned that ``any use of military force against Iraq
would lead to destabilizing the region.''
	   Raising a similar theme, Iraqi Trade Minister Mohammed Mehdi
Saleh said Tuesday that America ``will lose from any strike that
takes place, and Iraq will gain.''
	   Asked how, Saleh said ``politically.'' It reflected Iraq's
thinking that sympathy for the Iraqis _ especially on the Arab
streets _ would leave the United States isolated in its campaign
against the Baghdad regime.
	   The United States and Britain have threatened military action to
force Iraq to resume cooperate with the weapons inspectors. The
monitors must certify that Baghdad is rid of weapons of mass
destruction before the sanctions can be lifted.
	   Saleh made his comments at the closing ceremony of a 10-day
trade fair in Baghdad that drew delegations from 30 countries, 17
of them Arab or Muslim.
	   ``The presence of Arab companies represents the trend toward
normalizing and increasing relations,'' Saleh said in an interview
with The Associated Press.
	   The tactic of appealing to the Arabs is one indication of how
differently the current dispute is unfolding compared with the last
one.
	   At the start of the year, when Iraq refused U.N. inspectors
access to President Saddam Hussein's palaces, Russia, France and
Turkey rushed envoys to Iraq to try to head off a military strike
by the United States.
	   The dispute was resolved on Feb. 23 when U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan traveled to Baghdad and reached an 11th hour agreement
with Saddam to open the palace compounds.
	   This time, no foreign envoys have been dispatched, in part
because Iraq's defiance is not over a technical issue such as
whether palaces were subject to inspection but over the very
essence of the U.N. inspection program.
	   Iraq has said it will not resume cooperation with the U.N.
Special Commission until the Security Council begins to move toward
ending the trade sanctions.
	   There already are hints Iraq is prepared to go further in spite
of the U.S. and British threats.
	   Al-Thawra, a newspaper published by Saddam's ruling Baath Party,
said in an editorial on Monday that ``the language of threats will
make it legitimate for Iraq to review everything concerning its
relations with UNSCOM and the Security Council.''
	   Western diplomats said this implied that Iraq could reject
long-term U.N. monitoring of its weaponry or payments of war
reparations, as required under U.N. resolutions.
	   Iraq _ and some other Arab countries _ apparently hope Annan
will again step in.
	   Prakash Shah, Annan's special envoy in Baghdad, told reporters
on Monday that ``a number of foreign ministers in this region and
outside have suggested that the secretary-general visit'' to seek
an end to the impasse.
	   Iraq so far has allowed UNSCOM experts to stay in the country,
although they are not allowed to do field work. UNSCOM on Saturday
began reducing its staff from 130 to about 100, but said those
remaining here could resume inspections quickly if Iraq changes its
position.
	   Iraq's Oct. 31 decision exempted nuclear experts, and teams from
the Vienna-headquartered International Atomic Energy Agency have
gone into the field almost every day. On Tuesday, five teams
visited five sites _ the highest number this month.

Dutch divided on how best to switch to the euro
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS detail on transition plans in other euro nations. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ A Dutch forum planning the
introduction of the single European currency is split over whether
to phase in the euro over a month or replace the guilder in a
single-day switch.
	   The National Forum for the Introduction of the Euro sent a
proposal to parliament Tuesday to ease the euro into Dutch wallets
over a four-week period at the beginning of 2002.
	   The forum is made up of representatives from major trade unions,
the finance and economics ministries, Dutch companies and the
Amsterdam stock exchange.
	   But representatives of retailers and small businesses boycotted
the meeting at which the proposal was drawn up because of remarks
from Nout Wellink, the president of the Dutch Central Bank.
	   Wellink believes it is unrealistic for the new currency to be
introduced nationally in just one day. Commercial banks also have
expressed doubts that a so-called ``big bang'' introduction would
be possible.
	   But retailers are firm supporters of the one-day implementation.
An organization representing small businesses has estimated that
adapting machinery to cope with the two currencies side-by-side for
four weeks will cost retailers about 1 billion guilders (dlrs 535
million).
	   Although the new currency official debuts on Jan. 1, 1999, euro
coins and notes will come into circulation in the 11 euro-zone
nations between Jan. 1, 2002 and June 30, 2002.
	   During the transition period, it is planned that national tender
will be accepted as payment alongside euros, but only euros will be
returned as change.
	   ``The social cost can be significantly reduced if the E.U.
maximum of six months for the dual period is drastically
shortened,'' the Dutch forum concluded.
	   In France, Finance Minister Dominique Strauss-Kahn has proposed
a transition period of 10 weeks while Germany plans to change over
between Jan. 1, 2002, and February 28, 2002. In that period, both
Deutsche marks and euros will be accepted as payment, but banks,
retailers and vending machines will all give change only in euros.
	   Belgium, Spain, Italy, Austria and Ireland haven't decided on
transition details yet. Details of arrangements in Finland,
Luxembourg and Portugal were not immediately available.

Arafat invites Queen Elizabeth II for 2000 celebrations
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   RAMALLAH, West Bank (AP) _ Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat on
Tuesday invited Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip to visit the
Palestinian areas in honor of the millennium.
	   Arafat delivered the invitation during a meeting with Britain's
Duke of Kent, a cousin of the queen, who is on a three-day trade
mission to Israel and the autonomous Palestinian areas.
	   Arafat said in his halting English that he asked the duke to
``make a favor, to carry my best regards and thanks from my heart
to her majesty.''
	   The Palestinian leader said he has invited the queen and her
husband ``for the 2000 celebrations'' in the Holy Land. The
Palestinians hope to attract a large number of tourists to the
festivities, especially in Palestinian-run Bethlehem, the
traditional birthplace of Jesus.
	   The duke said that he knew of no plans by the queen to visit.

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Third-seeded Goran Ivanisevic of Croatia fired
eighteen aces to defeat Carsten Arriens of Germany in the second
day of play in the dlrs 1.1 million Kremlin Cup tennis tournament
Tuesday.
	   Defending champion Yevgeny Kafelnikov of Russia, seeded second,
outlasted his countryman Andrei Cherkasov, a wild card, 6-3, 6-4.
Kafelnikov holds the eighth position on the ATP rankings and still
has a chance to win a berth for Hannover.
	   It took the heavy-serving Ivanisevic, the 1996 Kremlin Cup
champion, an hour and twenty minutes to struggle through against
Arriens. Ivanisevic failed to break a single serve and won both
sets on a tiebreaker 7-6 (7-5), 7-6 (7-3).
	   Top-seeded Alex Corretja of Spain defeated John van Lottum of
the Netherlands, 6-3, 7-6 (7-2). Corretja, who is No.6 on the ATP
Tour, won four titles this year and has already qualified for the
ATP Championship in Hannover, Germany, later this month.
	   ``It's better to play on clay, but I have to improve my game on
hard courts, and that's why I'm trying to work,'' Corretja said.
``I think the most important thing is just to win, no matter 6-3 or
7-6.''
	   Marc Rosset of Switzerland, twice Kremlin Cup champion and
seeded sixth, eliminated Jeff Tarango of the United States in
straight sets 6-4, 6-4.

Girl's and grandmother's bodies found after floods
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ZAGREB, Croatia (AP) _ The bodies of a 4-year-old girl and her
64-year-old grandmother were found Tuesday after they went missing
during the last weekend's floods in villages around Zagreb, the
HINA news agency reported.
	   The rains swelled the river Sava, which runs through Croatia
from Slovenia to the northwest, and other local rivers, and water
flooded fields and entered houses and barns in villages along the
Sava.
	   The girl, Josipa Jaglic, and her grandmother, Katarina, went
missing on Sunday, as the river Kupcina flooded the village of
Cagalj, 20 kilometers (12.5 miles) southwest of Zagreb. The two
went to harvest corn.
	   Special police and divers were engaged in a two-day search.
	   The two are the first known casualties of the floods. A
9-year-old girl also went missing in the same area, but no body has
been found.

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ A British expert on performance-enhancing drugs
expressed optimism Tuesday that tests for human growth hormone, and
possibly EPO, will be ready in time for the 2000 Sydney Olympics.
	   Professor David Cowan, director of the Drug Control Center at
King's College London, said the doping lab in Sydney was prepared
to institute any new testing procedures at short notice.
	   ``We are optimistic we will be able to do some things in
Sydney,'' Cowan said in a telephone interview. ``I'm more
optimistic about HGH (human growth hormone) than EPO
(erythropoietin) at the moment.''
	   No valid tests exist for detecting HGH and EPO, banned drugs
which are believed to be the doping products of choice among many
athletes.
	   Growth hormone helps build strength, while EPO _ the drug at the
center of this summer's Tour de France scandals _ is an
endurance-boosting hormone.
	   Research to develop tests for the two drugs has been proceeding
in labs in London and other cities. The International Olympic
Committee says it will only introduce new tests if they are 100
percent foolproof.
	   Cowan, whose lab has done research on HGH administration, said
he believes blood samples would be required if reliable HGH and EPO
tests were used in Sydney.
	   ``If we are to detect growth hormone by the year 2000, then
blood samples will be necessary,'' he said. ``I believe that blood
is the necessary medium in the time span we are talking about.''
	   Cowan said progress on finding an EPO test has been more limited
because of a lack of research funds.
	   ``If I was pinned down about EPO, I would say there is a bit
more chance of using urine than blood,'' he said. ``But by the year
2000, blood is necessary if a test will work.''
	   Standard drug testing is done on urine samples only. Some
experts oppose blood testing on practical, moral and even religious
grounds.
	   Cowan sought to clarify remarks he made athe Olympic Games (SOCOG) said Tuesday the
IOC does not test blood samples and has said it won't do so until
100 percent reliable tests are found for EPO and HGH.
	   ``Our understanding is that research is still continuing into
finding a totally reliable test for these substances but it hasn't
been achieved yet,'' the spokesman said.
	   SOCOG doping officials have consistently said they are ready to
implement blood tests if scientists find the answers and the IOC
gives them the green light.

<TEXT>
	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ Brian Lara apologized on
Tueaday for the delay in the start of the West Indies' first
post-apartheid tour of South Africa, but avoided discussion of a
pay revolt that threatened to end the trip before it started.
	   ``They're pretty sorry at this time for any offense,'' Lara said
of his teammates during his first public comments since the dispute
was resolved with West Indian cricket officials earlier this week.
	   ``We also want to thank President Mandela for the letter he sent
to us in London during the discussions. Everyone on the team
respects President Mandela tremendously and the gesture was deeply
appreciated.''
	   Nelson Mandela had urged that the cricketers resolve their
differences. The president sees sports as an avenue of racial
healing after the fall of white minority rule four years ago.
	   The West Indian team arrived in South Africa on Tuesday, the day
the tour was scheduled to begin but was nearly wiped out by the
issue over pay.
	   Lara refused to discuss the settlement, sayin it ``totally
confidential.''
	   ``The team is here to win the test series and the whole team,
apart from Jimmy Adams, is fit,'' he said.
	   The star batsman cut the pinky of his right hand with a bread
knife while trying to cut through a hard roll on the flight over,
Ali Bacher, head of South Africa's United Cricket Board, told
reporters.
	   The team arrived without fast bowlers Courtney Walsh and Curtley
Ambrose, who arrived late on Monday to the London airport for their
flight to South Africa, Bacher said.
	   The tour was scheduled to begin Tuesday with an exhibition match
in Randjiesfontein near Johannesburg, but now will start with a
one-day match against a Gauten provincial side in Soweto on
Wednesday.
	   The tour is the first by the West Indies since the fall of
apartheid in South Africa, where cricket is followed mainly by
whites. The presence of the black Caribbean team is a boost to
efforts to promote the sport among South African blacks, who mostly
follow soccer.
	   Problems started last week when Lara, the team captain, and vice
captain Carl Hooper refused to go to South Africa, demanding better
pay and conditions. They were suspended, but reinstated as part of
the settlement Monday.
	   West Indies cricket officials said the pact calls for no
increase in the players' fees for the South Africa tour, but that
the payments would be restructured. The West Indies board promised
to try to improve pay on future tours.
	   The board agreed to recognize the role of the players union,
review player insurance coverage and the grievance and disciplinary
code and work toward a joint marketing program that would allow
players a share in revenues.
	   ``It wasn't easy yesterday,'' Bacher said earlier Tuesday. ``At
the end of the day, the board acknowledged and realized the
importance of the tour, and the players acknowledged and realized
the importance of the tour.''
	   ``Good sense triumphed in the end and I am sure you are going to
see a wonderful tour.''
	   West Indies tour manager Clive Lloyd, at the airport, described
the dispute as a ``little lull in their careers,'' referring to
Lara and Hooper.
	   ``But they are professional people and know what's expected of
them,'' he said.

Russian government to nationalize largest private bank

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The government said Tuesday it will take over
Russia's largest private savings bank and proposed other
Soviet-style measures while it huddled in a closed session with the
Communist-dominated parliament.
	   Meanwhile, hoping to stave off hunger for ordinary Russians amid
the country's worst economic crisis since the Soviet collapse, the
government announced a tentative agreement on food aid with the
European Union on Tuesday _ just days after a similar deal was
reached with the United States.
	   Russia's government has indicated it may nationalize the
country's largest commercial banks, many of which are suffering
acutely from Russia's financial collapse, insisting that it would
save them from failure.
	   Critics have warned that the move will only bring more debts for
the government _ which has already defaulted on some of its
obligations and is seeking to reschedule the rest.
	   But Deputy Prime Minister Gennady Kulik said Tuesday that the
government will acquire a controlling interest in the bank SBS-Agro
before the end of the year. The move would mean a nationalization
of the bank, which has the second-largest retail network after
state-controlled Sberbank.
	   ``Returning control of the bank to the state is in line with our
principles of building a financial system in the agricultural
sector,'' Kulik was quoted as saying by the Interfax news agency.
	   SBS-Agro handled many of the loans and money transfers from the
government to Russia's impoverished farms before it was shaken by
the economic crisis.
	   Meanwhile, Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov rounded up several of
his top Cabinet ministers and headed to parliament Tuesday in a bid
to win support for his economic recovery program.
	   The session at parliament was closed and few details were
available. But centrist parliamentary leader Alexander Shokhin said
the discussion revolved around command-economy plans proposed by
First Deputy Prime Minister Yuri Maslyukov for next year.
	   Maslyukov, a Communist, ``set out several possible scenarios of
overcoming the crisis in the spirit of the (Soviet planning agency)
Gosplan,'' Shokhin said, according to Russian news agencies.
	   Gosplan stretched its control into even the smallest branches of
the Soviet economy, dictating how much of each product was to be
produced and where it was to be delivered, leaving no room for the
influences of supply and demand.
	   Russia's economic crisis, combined with drought and falling food
imports, has raised concerns about the country's food supplies
heading into the winter. No serious shortages have been reported,
but the government wants to ensure that plenty of food is on hand.
	   Under the deal with the European Union, Russia would purchase
food worth dlrs 480 million and receive EU humanitarian aid worth
dlrs 12 million to 14 million, Kulik said, according to Russian
news agencies.
	   Russia has also signed a dlrs 625 million agreement with the
United States for 3.1 million tons of U.S. food aid, including
wheat, corn, pork and beef.

Israel's Cabinet to reconvene to ratify peace accord
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has won new
assurances from the Palestinians about their anti-terror campaign
and will convene his Cabinet on Wednesday to resume debate on the
Mideast peace accord.
	   Cabinet ratification, which has been postponed four times in two
weeks, would pave the way for the implementation of the
land-for-security accord under which Israel would withdraw from 13
percent of the West Bank over 12 weeks.
	   U.S. officials have urged Netanyahu to stick to the timetable,
which requires Israel to hand over 2 percent of the West Bank on
Monday.
	   Israel's announcement Tuesday that the 18-member Cabinet would
meet Wednesday morning came after Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat
complained that Netanyahu was willfully delaying implementation.
	   ``We expect that Netanyahu will waste a lot of time and he's not
going to implement the agreement honestly and quickly at all,''
Arafat said earlier Tuesday.
	   A senior Palestinian negotiator had also warned the Palestinians
might stop fulfilling their commitments under the accord, including
a crackdown on Islamic militants, if Israel's Cabinet did not
ratify the U.S.-brokered agreement in the next few days.
	   ``Implementation cannot be unilateral. It must be mutual and
reciprocal,'' Palestinian negotiator Hasan Asfour told reporters.
	   In the past two weeks, Netanyahu postponed the Cabinet debate
three times, saying he needed more clarifications from the
Palestinians about their campaign against Islamic militants.
	   It was delayed a fourth time on Friday after two members of the
Islamic Jihad group blew up their rigged car in a Jerusalem market,
killing themselves and wounding 21 Israeli shoppers.
	   Netanyahu said he would not reconvene the ministers until the
Palestinian Authority outlined how it would prevent attacks against
Israelis in the future.
	   Netanyahu said in a statement Tuesday that he decided to
reconvene the Cabinet after ``receiving reports that the
Palestinian Authority decided to take practical steps against
Palestinian terror groups and their infrastructure.'' He did not
elaborate.
	   U.S. officials have said the accord's clock began ticking on
Nov. 2, or 10 days after the Oct. 23 signing of the agreement at
the White House.
	   In a first step, the Palestinians submitted a detailed
anti-terror plan. In a second stage, on Friday, the PLO Executive
Committee reaffirmed a letter Arafat sent to U.S. President Bill
Clinton listing the clauses of the PLO charter that were no longer
valid.
	   Meanwhile, despite its security crackdown, the Palestinian
Authority has renewed high-level meetings with the Islamic militant
groups Hamas and Islamic Jihad, apparently to try to prevent a
violent backlash.
	   Hamas and Islamic Jihad representatives met separately Monday
with one of Arafat's closest advisers, Tayeb Abdel-Rahim.
	   Abdel-Rahim would not comment on the meetings, but Imad Falouji,
a former Hamas activist and member of Arafat's Cabinet, suggested
the aim was to work out a relationship whereby Hamas and Islamic
Jihad would be recognized as legitimate opposition groups in
exchange for agreeing to end their efforts to sabotage the peace
accords.
	   Also Tuesday, dozens of Palestinians blocked an Israeli
bulldozer trying to pave a bypass road for Jewish settlers on 40
acres (16 hectares) of West Bank land confiscated from the
Palestinians.
	   About 30 Israeli soldiers tried for several hours to negotiate a
solution, but when that failed, the work was halted for a week so
the sides could take the dispute to court.

	   SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) _ Chile's ambasador to Spain said Tuesday
that he will return to Madrid early next week after being briefly
recalled to protest the Spanish request to extradite Gen. Augusto
Pinochet from Britain.
	   ``I will return to Madrid early next week. That is all I can
tell you at this point,'' Sergio Pizarro said at the foreign
ministry.
	   Pizarro flew Monday to the Chilean capital and has already
discussed the Pinochet situation with President Eduardo Frei and
Foreign Minister Jose Miguel Insulza.
	   Insulza said Pizarro's recall was a way to express ``our deep
displeasure'' with the decision by the Spanish government to agree
to Judge Baltasar Garzon's request to extradite Pinochet.
	   But Chile will not break diplomatic relations with Spain,
Insulza said.
	   Pinochet was arrested Oct. 16 in Britain on a warrant issued by
Garzon who wants to try him on charges genocide, torture and
terrorism in connection with the estimated 3,000 suspected
dissidents who were killed or disappeared during his 17-year rule.

Burundian army kills more than 100 civilians, survivors say

<TEXT>
	   RUTOVU, Burundi (AP) _ The army killed more than 100 mostly Hutu
civilians in retaliation for a Hutu rebel attack on a camp for
minority Tutsis, survivors said Tuesday.
	   The attack the night of Nov. 3-4 in Rutovu, 35 kilometers (20
miles) southeast of the capital, Bujumbura, was the deadliest since
a third round of peace talks ended last month with scant progress.
	   Hutu rebels are fighting to topple the military government of
Pierre Buyoya, a member of the Tutsi minority, which accounts for
14 percent of Burundi's population of 6 million. Hutus make up 85
percent.
	   Witnesses, who spoke on condition of anonymity, told independent
Studio Ijambo that on the night of Oct. 30-31, Hutu rebels attack a
camp for 840 displaced Tutsis at Maramvya, killing five people,
wounding two others and stealing many cows.
	   Three days later, the army came to nearby Rutovu and asked
villagers where the rebels were. Villagers said they didn't know.
Soldiers killed three people, accusing them of cooperating with the
rebels, witnesses said.
	   On Nov. 3-4 soldiers attacked, the witnesses said.
	   ``They burned many houses and killed 70 persons, most of them
were children and women,'' said Jean Mabano, 30. Other witnesses,
who refused to be identified, said more than 100 people were
killed.
	   ``I buried 19 dead. My wife and my six children survived because
I gave 10,000 Burundian francs (dlrs 25) to the soldiers,'' said a
32-year-old man who requested anonymity.
	   Local administrator Aloys Baransotera said at least 49 people
were killed, but he could not confirm that the army was to blame.
Fighting in the area was continuing, he said.
	   The local military commander, Col. Niyoyunguruza said he could
not comment without permission from his superiors.
	   In Bujumbura, military spokesman Col. Isaie Nibizi said he had
not yet received a detailed report on the attack, ``but based on
preliminary information, it appears that some civilians were killed
in Rutovu.'' He refused to comment on who was to blame.
	   Soldiers in the Tutsi-dominated military in the past have killed
Hutu civilians in retaliation for rebel attacks, especially those
on Tutsi civilians and army patrols and outposts.
	   More than 200,000 people died in violence that broke out in
Burundi in 1993, after Tutsi paratroopers assassinated Burundi's
first democratically elected president, Melchoir Ndadaye, a Hutu.

Ukraine's government requests probe of tax-dodging companies
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES wage debt figure in new graf 6, new tax debt
statistics in final graf. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Ukraine's Cabinet asked the chief
prosecutor's office Tuesday to investigate several hundred
companies accused of hiding their hard currency earnings abroad to
avoid paying taxes.
	   In an appeal published in the government daily Uriadovy Kurier,
the Cabinet named 363 companies, saying each of them hid at least
dlrs 100,000 in revenues in foreign bank accounts.
	   Prime Minister Valery Pustovoitenko told a Cabinet meeting
Tuesday that the estimated sum of hard currency revenues Ukrainian
exporters have failed to report to tax authorities was dlrs 836
million as of Oct. 1.
	   He said the Cabinet would continue devising means of extracting
money from debtor companies to pay off the cash-strapped country's
mounting wage arrears.
	   Employees throughout Ukraine are owed 6.5 billion hryvna (dlrs
1.9 billion) in unpaid wages, Deputy Prime Minister Mykola
Biloblotsky told the Cabinet.
	   He said that 3.8 billion hryvna (dlrs 1.1 billion) of that sum
is owed by the government, and the debt has increased by 46 percent
since the beginning of the year.
	   Ukraine also faces a growing foreign debt, now at dlrs 10.9
billion, and was badly hit by the economic crisis in neighboring
Russia, which scared away foreign investors.
	   The Ukrainian government has chronically failed to collect
taxes, which companies avoid because they say the rates are
prohibitively high, and was slow to implement reforms needed to
boost budget revenues.
	   Instead, Pustovoitenko has launched a desperate crusade to
collect taxes from debtor companies, locking their directors in a
Cabinet room several times in previous months, and threatening to
freeze the businesses' bank accounts.
	   Pustovoitenko also has set up special tax posts at the offices
of debtor companies, seized thousands of cars from them and
launched dozens of criminal and bankruptcy cases.
	   But the measures so far have done little to improve the
situation.
	   Biloblotsky said enterprises' debt to the federal and regional
governments has more than tripled since the beginning of the year,
and stands at 8.3 billion hryvna (dlrs 2.4 billion).

Former prime minister acquitted in bombings trial
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MOHAMED OSMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) _ A military tribunal acquitted Tuesday a
leading opposition leader and 16 others in a bombing case for lack
of evidence but sentenced one person to life imprisonment, Sudanese
radio reported.
	   Two more opposition activists were sentenced to two and three
years in prison, the radio said.
	   Of the 17 people acquitted, 15 were tried in absentia, including
former Prime Minister Sadiq el-Mahdi, his son Abdel-Rahman and
former Agriculture Minister Omar Nur-Eldayem.
	   The case stemmed from two bombings in February in the city of
Wadi Madani, 150 kilometers (94 miles) southeast of Khartoum. The
explosions claimed no lives but damaged some buildings.
	   Five people were caught by security forces after planting
explosives at a government building and a service station.
	   One of them, Rahmat-Allah el-Bashir Idriss, was sentenced to
life. He and the other two men who received the short prison terms
confessed to receiving trailing on explosives in an opposition camp
in neighboring Eritrea, the radio said.
	   Prosecutors claimed the camp was under the control of el-Mahdi,
the former prime minister.
	   The court, however, found no evidence apart from the statements
of the accused incriminating el-Mahdi personally and the 14 others,
who were all tried in absentia. They were charged with involvement
in the plot.
	   The ruling of military tribunals can not be appealed but the
defendants can apply for clemency to the head of state.
	   El-Mahdi was overthrown in a 1989 bloodless coup by current
President Lt. Gen. Omar el-Bashir. He fled Sudan in 1996 to
Eritrea.
	   El-Mahdi's Umma Party has joined hands with the Sudan People's
Liberation Army, a guerrilla group, in a larger opposition
alliance-in-exile against el-Bashir's government.
	   The SPLA has been fighting since 1983 for greater autonomy for
the southern districts, which are predominantly Christian and
animist, and resent the authority of the Islamist north.

Armenia, Azerbaijan welcome OSCE plan on Nagorno-Karabakh
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   YEREVAN, Armenia (AP) _ Armenia and Azerbaijan have both
expressed interest in a new plan proposed by U.S., French and
Russian mediators for settling the dispute over Nagorno-Karabakh, a
negotiator said Tuesday.
	   The three co-chairmen of a negotiating team from the
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe visited Armenia
on Tuesday to present the latest plan. They had discussed the
proposal with Azerbaijan the day before.
	   The plan would give broad autonomy to Nagorno-Karabakh, a mostly
Armenian enclave inside Azerbaijan, but keep it part of Azerbaijan,
news reports said.
	   Presidents Geidar Aliev of Azerbaijan and Robert Kocharian of
Armenia considered the ideas ``very serious and quite novel,'' and
promised to study them carefully, said the Russian chairman of the
talks, Yuri Yukalov.
	   Few details of the plan were available. ``We agreed that the
talks will be strictly confidential,'' Yukalov said.
	   A 1994 truce ended fighting that began in the late 1980s over
Nagorno-Karabakh, but OSCE-mediated efforts for a political
settlement have dragged and occasional skirmishes are still
reported.
	   The OSCE's latest proposals also pay special attention to
refugees displaced by the war between the neighboring former Soviet
republics, the French chairman, Georges Vaugier, has said.
	   Yukalov, Vaugier and their American co-chairman, Donald Kaiser,
will also visit Nagorno-Karabakh to share the proposal with the
leadership of the separatist enclave.

Israel's Cabinet to reconvene to ratify peace accord
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: COMBINES urgent series, RECASTS to clarify that vote expected
Wednesday &QL; 
 &UR; By KARIN LAUB &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ After two weeks of delays, Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu announced he would convene his Cabinet Wednesday
to ratify the land-for-security agreement with the Palestinians.
	   Netanyahu said Tuesday he made the decision after getting new
assurances that the Palestinian Authority would take ``practical
steps'' against Islamic militants.
	   U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright had urged Netanyahu
to stick to the original 12-week timetable of the accord under
which Israel is to withdraw from 13 percent of the West Bank by the
end of January, in exchange for a Palestinian anti-terror campaign.
	   If the Cabinet ratifies the agreement on Wednesday, Israel might
still be able to meet its first commitment _ a first troop pullback
Monday from 2 percent of the West Bank.
	   Earlier Tuesday, before Netanyahu decided to put the agreement
back on track, Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat complained that the
Israeli leader was willfully delaying implementation.
	   ``We expect that Netanyahu will waste a lot of time and he's not
going to implement the agreement honestly and quickly at all,''
Arafat said after a meeting with the Duke of Kent in the West Bank
town of Ramallah.
	   Palestinian negotiator Hassan Asfour warned that the
Palestinians might stop fulfilling their commitments under the
accord if Israel's Cabinet did not ratify the U.S.-brokered
agreement in the next few days.
	   ``Implementation cannot be unilateral. It must be mutual and
reciprocal,'' Asfour told reporters.
	   In the past two weeks, Netanyahu postponed the Cabinet debate
three times, saying he needed more clarifications from the
Palestinians about their campaign against Islamic militants.
	   Last Friday, the ministers had just begun their second day of
debate on the peace accord when the Islamic Jihad group carried out
a suicide bombing in Jerusalem's market, wounding 21 Israelis.
	   In response, Netanyahu broke off the Cabinet meeting and said he
would not reconvene the ministers until the Palestinian Authority
outlined how it would prevent attacks against Israelis.
	   Netanyahu said in a statement Tuesday that he had ``received
reports that the Palestinian Authority decided to take practical
steps against Palestinian terror groups and their infrastructure.''
	   However, Netanyahu also introduced a new snag.
	   He suggested that he would stop the troop withdrawal process in
the middle if the Palestinians did not meet an Israeli demand
concerning the procedure for revoking clauses of the PLO founding
charter that call for Israel's destruction.
	   The Wye agreement says the Palestine National Council and other
Palestinian organizations will meet in mid-December to ``reaffirm''
a January letter by Arafat to U.S. President Bill Clinton that
lists the PLO charter clauses considered annulled.
	   Israel insists that the agreement requires the PNC to take a
formal vote, while the Palestinians say only approval of the letter
by acclamation is required.
	   Netanyahu said in Tuesday's statement: ``If the Cabinet approves
the Wye agreement, it will add to the decision the following
stipulation: the implementation of the rest of the agreement will
be conditional on the PNC convening and voting to change the
charter.''
	   Israel radio said the Cabinet would also discuss the paving of
bypass roads for Jewish settlers in the West Bank.
	   One of the projects to be discussed is a road near the
Palestinian refugee camp of Al Aroub that would require the
confiscation of thousands of acres of Palestinian land.
	   Israeli military commanders oppose the Al Aroub road, fearing
the massive land confiscation would lead to Palestinian riots, the
Haaretz daily said.

Countries falter but big business forges ahead
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By HARRY DUNPHY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 
 &UR; Eds: For release at 2200 GMT &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Despite financial crises in Asia and Russia
and slower global economic growth, world business giants may spend
up to a record dlrs 440 billion expanding overseas operations this
year, an international trade report said Tuesday.
	   These investments are the engine driving globalization of the
world economy and are increasing as nations' financial systems
become more intertwined, according to an annual report by the U.N.
Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD).
	   But Asia's financial turmoil may put a brake on flows to that
region for the first time since 1985. China, the boom economy for
developing countries, will experience a slowdown after six years of
rapid gains, the report says, projecting investment in China this
year at dlrs 40 billion, down dlrs 5 billion from 1997.
	   Given the gloomy financial news from around the world in recent
months, UNCTAD's chief economist, Karl Savant, said many people
might find it surprising the organization is predicting rising
levels in foreign investment for 1998.
	   But he said the world's biggest corporations ``have long-term
horizons for foreign direct investment and returns on these
investments.'' As a result, these companies do not head for the
exits at the first sign of bad news the way international investors
often do, he added.
	   Savant said traditional factors such as national resources and
low cost labor still influence where foreign investments are made.
	   ``But our report shows that increasingly, transnational
companies are seeking investment locations offering people-made
advantages,'' he said, such as communications infrastructure,
marketing networks or managerial or technological skills.
	   Savant said countries that develop these assets become more
attractive to major international companies.
	   The United States remains by far the largest investor abroad as
well as the biggest recipient of foreign investment, the 428-page
report said. In 1997, inflows to the United States increased by 19
percent to dlrs 91 billion. Britain was a distant second at dlrs 36
billion.
	   The report said the 15-nation European Union continued to be the
most important investment partner for the United States. While
Britain saw large investment gains, Austria, France and Belgium
registered significant declines, reflecting changing perceptions of
their attractiveness.
	   In central and eastern Europe, foreign investment increased by
more than 40 percent to a record dlrs 19 billion in 1997, with
Russia accounting for dlrs 6.2 billion or a third of the region's
total.
	   Savant said he expected approximately the same amount of
investment in Russia this year because its economy did not go onto
the rocks until mid-August.
	   The report said that among developing regions, Latin America and
the Caribbean are the star performer in attracting investment.
Brazil led the way, staying ahead of Mexico for the second straight
year by attracting dlrs 16.3 billion in investment in 1997 to
Mexico's dlrs 12 billion.
	   In Asia, Korea was the second-biggest destination for foreign
investment last year after China, the report said. The trend is
likely to continue in 1998 even though the Korean economy went into
free fall at the end of last year and required a dlrs 58 billion
international rescue package.

Celtic legend Kenny Dalglish wants to buy former club
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with club confirmation, other details

<TEXT>
	   GLASGOW, Scotland (AP) _ Former Celtic great Kenny Dalglish and
pop star Jim Kerr head a consortium that is poised to make a
multi-million-pound (dollar) takeover bid for the Scottish league
champion, the club confirmed Tuesday.
	   The club released a statement saying the group headed by
Dalglish and Kerr, lead singer of Simple Minds, had requested a
meeting with Celtic's majority shareholder, chairman and managing
director Fergus McCann.
	   The statement said the approach ``may or may not lead to an
offer for his shares and/or an offer for the entire issued share
capital of the company.
	   ``As of today no meeting has taken place. The valuation being
placed on Celtic plc by the consortium is substantially below the
current market price of Celtic plc.''
	   McCann released a statement reiterating his stance that his
preference remains to split his holdings among several existing
parties.
	   ``I am aware of the speculation surrounding my shareholding,''
he said. ``I have had enquiries from various parties regarding my
controlling interest in Celtic, however, I will respect the
confidential nature of these enquiries.
	   ``My feeling still remains the same, that the best plan for
Celtic is to make shares available at some point next year to the
existing shareholders and season book holders in the first
instance.''
	   Earlier, when media reports of the possible takeover first
circulated, there was frenzied dealing on the London Stock
Exchange. Celtic's shares went up nearly 40 percent, adding 12.9
million pounds (dlrs 21.5 million) to its market value.
	   Dalglish, former manager at Liverpool, Blackburn and Newcastle,
is seeking to make an emotional return to the Scottish club where
he first made his name.
	   The British domestic news agency Press Association said Dalglish
would take on a role as shareholder/owner but would also have a
major interest on the soccer side, with a manager or coach being
brought in under him.
	   A large amount of money would be set aside for new transfers,
believed to be well above 10 million pounds (dlrs 1.67 million),
the report said.
	   Dalglish made 324 appearances for Celtic between 1968 and 1977,
and also set a national record of 102 appearances for Scotland. He
is currently out of soccer after being fired as Newcastle manager
earlier this season.
	   Dalglish has already been linked with the general manager's post
at Celtic, which became vacant following the resignation of Jock
Brown last Saturday.
	   Celtic won the Scottish League title last season after nine
years' of dominance by archrival Rangers. Celtic has struggled this
season following the departure of coach Wim Jansen.
	   The club hase been eliminated from the Champions Cup, the UEFA
Cup, the Scottish League Cup and lies third in the Scottish Premier
League _ seven points behind leaders Rangers.
	   McCann arrived at Celtic in 1994 with a ``five-year plan'' to
transform the club and has indicated that he is prepared to leave
at the end of that period _ next March. But there is no certainty
he will agree to sell out to Dalglish and Kerr.
	   McCann has publicly stated in the past that he intends to sell
his shares to a series of individual shareholders rather than a
consortium.

U.N. health chief urges greater funding

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ Countries must increase funding of the World
Health Organization to avoid cutbacks and to stop the spread of
AIDS and other diseases, the agency's new director-general told its
members Tuesday.
	   Budget freezes have led to a 22 percent cut in real terms of
WHO's budget over the last 10 years, said Dr. Gro Harlem
Brundtland, who has restructured the agency during her first three
months in the post.
	   ``This trend cannot continue,'' she added. More money is needed
to ``keep pace'' with diseases such as HIV/AIDS, Brundtland told
reporters.
	   The former Norwegian prime minister took over the 50-year-old
agency in July, promising overcome internal problems and focus its
work. The agency's 50 programs have been reduced to 35 and
reorganized under new managers.
	   WHO organizes massive vaccination efforts, coordinates global
response to epidemics and fosters the widespread distribution of
medicine. It also launched new programs to combat smoking among
young people and malaria.
	   The agency has a two-year budget for this year and next of dlrs
835 million. The agency has now raised half of a planned dlrs 10
million ``renewal fund'' to be spent over three years, Brundtland
said.
	   Voluntary contributions from governments should be in line with
priorities identified by WHO itself, Brundtland said.
	   ``It could happen that we may say no, thank you,'' to funding
offers that don't meet those criteria, she added.
	   It has more than 3,500 staff worldwide, some 1,300 of them based
in Geneva. Staff were not laid off in the restructuring.

Former fund manager appears on fraud charge

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ A former fund manager at Morgan Grenfell appeared
in court Tuesday charged with conspiracy to defraud in a stock
pricing scandal that cost the investment bank millions.
	   Peter Young, 40, who is free on conditional bail, arrived at
court wearing a loose-fitting woman's sweater and floral printed
skirt and makeup but made no comment.
	   He attended the City of London Magistrates' Court with two
co-accused, Erik Langaker, 35, and Jan Helge Johnsen, 38. A fourth
accused, Stewart Armer, 33, was not in court.
	   All four men, charged last month with fraud and withholding
information under the Financial Services Act, are due to appear in
court again on March 15.
	   Young got into trouble by filling three big investment funds
with stocks that were of uncertain value because they were not
traded on any exchange.
	   Morgan Grenfell vastly overestimated the value of the funds, and
a crisis erupted when investors learned about the irregularities
and began panic-selling in September 1996.
	   Trading in the funds was halted for three days and resumed only
after Morgan Grenfell's parent company, Germany's Deutsche Bank,
paid 180 million pounds ($293 million) to buy some of the
questionable stocks and bring the funds into compliance with London
regulations.
	   Morgan Grenfell eventually was fined a record 2 million pounds
($3.25 million) and had to repay 200 million pounds ($325 million)
to investors.
	   Court papers said Armer also once worked as a fund manager at
Morgan Grenfell. Langaker and Johnson were formerly employed by
Fiba Nordic Securities, a London brokerage firm which which Young
had dealings.
	   They are also free on conditional bail.

Former foreign minister won't resign as head of legal body
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Former Foreign Minister Roland Dumas, under fire
for his alleged involvement in a multi-million-dollar kickback
scheme, said Tuesday he won't resign as president of one of
France's highest legal bodies.
	   ``With a clean conscience, I will continue to preside with
serenity and objectivity over the Constitutional Council, which
continues to function without problems,'' Dumas said in a
statement.
	   Dumas has come under increasing political pressure to resign
after his former mistress, Christine Deviers-Joncour, published a
book last month giving her account of his involvement in the
embezzlement scheme.
	   Investigators say Deviers-Joncour, about 20 years Dumas' junior,
was hired to lobby him to secure the state-owned Thomson company's
1991 contract to build frigates for Taiwan.
	   In her book, ``The Whore of the Republic,'' Deviers-Joncour
acknowledges the lobbying job, though she makes no reference to the
dlrs 12 million commission _ from another state-owned company _ she
allegedly shared with Dumas.
	   Commenting on the book, Dumas said: ``The part about me shows
more about the author's imagination than about the reality of our
relationship.''
	   In April, Dumas was placed under formal investigation, one step
short of being charged, for ``complicity and receiving embezzled
public funds.''
	   Dumas has denied the accusations.

Agriculture minister says EU measures on pork not enough
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ France's agriculture minister said Tuesday that the
European Commission's measures to ease the French pork crisis would
``not be enough'' to boost plunging pork prices.
	   The European Commission in Brussels announced Monday that
100,000 tons of pork from France would be shipped to Russia.
	   But the measures were only a first step, said Jean Glavany,
France's agriculture minister.
	   ``These measures... free up the market, allowing exports to
Russia to help the food crisis there, which is good because it will
bring the price back up,'' Glavany told France 2 television.
``Still, they are not enough.''
	   For several weeks, the price of pork has fallen below production
cost, and many of France's 20,000 pork farmers have protested to
demand more government aid.
	   Glavany said more steps must be taken to resolve the crisis. The
council of agriculture ministers for the fifteen European Union
countries will meet Nov. 23 and 24 to discuss means of curbing
supply.

Prolific author Rumer Godden dead at 90
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; RETRANSMITTING for European subscribers &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Rumer Godden, a prolific author whose imagination
was fired by living in India, has died at age 90.
	   Godden, who published her 21st novel, ``Cromartie vs. The God
Shiva,'' last year, died Sunday in a nursing home near her
daughter's home in Thornhill, Scotland, according to an obituary
published Tuesday in The Guardian. The cause of death was not
announced.
	   She had her first major success with her third novel, ``Black
Narcissus,'' published in 1939. The story of a group of nuns who
establish a convent in northern India, it explored themes of
cultural conflict and obsessive love. It was made into a film
starring Deborah Kerr in 1947.
	   ``The River,'' published in 1949, was one of her most acclaimed
books and was made into a film by Jean Renoir in 1951.
	   Margaret Rumer Godden was born Dec. 10, 1907, in the south coast
city of Eastbourne. She was was 9 months old when her family moved
to India, where her father ran a shipping line.
	   ``Our house was streaked with Indian or Indian streaked with
English,'' Godden wrote in ``Two under the Indian Sun,'' and memoir
co-authored with her sister Jon Godden in 1966. ``It might have
been an uneasy hybrid but we were completely and happily at home.''
	   Godden and her three sisters were mostly educated at home.
``There was all the time in the world to think; avenues of time;
even our lessons were at a slow pace; we were not continually
brisked along, as happens to most children of school age,'' she
recalled.
	   She returned to London at age 20 to learn how to teach dance to
children, and opened a school back in India. She fell in love with
a stockbroker, Laurence Sinclair Foster, became pregnant and
married him. Returning to England while she was pregnant, she wrote
her first book, ``Chinese Puzzle,'' published in 1936.
	   The baby died at birth, but the ill-suited couple later had two
daughters. The marriage ended in 1941, and Foster left her
penniless and alone in Calcutta. ``I have distrusted charm ever
since,'' she said.
	   She tried to repay his debts, and moved her family into a
mountain cottage where she ran a school, made herbal teas for sale
and wrote books. The family survived an apparent poisoning attempt
by two servants, an episode which figured in her 1953 novel,
``Kingfishers Catch Fire.''
	   She returned to England to stay in 1945, and made a happy second
marriage in 1949 to James Haynes-Dixon, a civil servant. He died in
1973.
	   ``The Doll's House,'' the first of more than two dozen books for
children, appeared in 1947. Godden said the inspiration was to see
``if I could write a real novel--it's a murder story--in the tiny
compass of a doll's house, and make it acceptable for children.''
	   Godden is survived by her two daughters. Funeral arrangements
were not immediately announced.

Spain's government rules out discussing Basque independence with
</HEADLINE>
ETA &QL; 
 &UR; By DANIEL WOOLLS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ The Spanish government has ruled out any
discussion of Basque independence in expected peace talks with the
armed separatist group ETA, a government spokesman said Tuesday.
	   Spokesman Josep Pique said the government would only negotiate
terms for ETA to surrender its weapons and the fate of more than
500 ETA prisoners in jails around Spain.
	   ``In the peace process, this is all there is to talk about,''
Pique told reporters in the northeastern city of Barcelona.
	   ``No one should think there is going to be any kind of political
negotiation on the basis of what might arise when the violence
ends,'' he added.
	   Pique was speaking a day after a senior official from the
opposition Socialist party warned that ETA, which began observing
an open-ended ceasefire on Sept. 18, was attempting to force
full-blown talks on the future of the Basque country as its price
for renouncing violence for good.
	   Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar, flush with a strong showing by
his center-right Popular Party in Basque regional elections on Oct.
25, said last Tuesday his government is willing to hold preliminary
talks with ETA.
	   The purpose of these discussions, the government said, would be
for ETA to confirm that it really wants peace.
	   Two days later ETA issued a statement that fell short of
promising a permanent end to violence. The document was dated
before Aznar's offer.
	   In it ETA supported a Basque nationalist peace proposal that
calls for a two-track process made up of negotiations between the
government and ETA, on issues like weapons and prisoners, and
separate all-party talks on the future of the Basque country.
	   These latter discussions would touch on ETA's stated goal of
independence, according to this blueprint signed by a broad range
of nationalist Basque parties and known as the Lizarra Declaration
after a town in Spain's northern Basque region.
	   Pique's remarks ruling out talks on independence come as both
sides jockey to shape a peace-talks agenda that suits them best,
with the government seeking to keep it as narrow as possible, while
ETA is trying to push it open.
	   ETA, which stands for Basque Homeland and Freedom, has killed
nearly 800 people in its 30-year campaign for an independent Basque
nation carved out of parts of northern Spain and southern France.

<TEXT>
	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ Cedric Pioline won five of the first
six points and closed with an ace but stuggled somewhat in between
before prevailing 6-5, 7-3 over Swedish teen-ager Andreas
Vinciguerra in the Stockholm Open on Tuesday.
	   ``Pioline is the best player I've played against,'' the
17-year-old Vinciguerra said.
	   Later Tuesday, American Todd Martin ousted Ivo Heuberger of
Switzerland in straight sets, 6-1, 6-2.
	   The day's feature match pitted world No. 7 Karol Kucera of
Slovakia against Australian Wayne Arthurs.
	   Seven of the world's top 20 players are entred in the
825,000-dollar event.
	   On Wednesday, top seed Pete Sampras was set to continue his
quest to finish 1998 ranked No. 1 for a record sixth straight year.
His scheduled opponent was Jason Stoltenberg of Australia, who has
lost to Sampras all the four times they've played.
	   Pioline broke Vinciguerra's serve in the sixth game and won the
set easily.
	   But Vinciguerra rallied in the second set, breaking Pioline's
serve twice, but with the score tied at 5-5, Sweden's top-rated
teen double-faulted while serving for the lead.
	   The game went to deuce six times, and despite two aces,
Vinciguerra also clubbed another serve into the net before sening
game-point into the stands.
	   ``At that point, I was nervous,'' he said.
	   The 1.77-meter (5-foot-9) 66-kilos (145-pound teen-ager said
he's planning to play on the satellite circuit and fewer junior
matches.
	   ``I must serve better, much better,'' Vinciguerra said. ``I
don't think he (Pioline) played so good as he can.''
	   Pioline was the third seed to advance to the second round.
Briton Tim Henman and defending champion Jonas Bjorkman of Sweden
won in straight sets Monday while Thomas Enqvist, the tournament
winner in 1996 and 1995, was upset by lightly regarded Japanese
Takao Suzuki in three sets.

Shooting erupts in northern city after arrests
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TIRANA, Albania (AP) _ Armed men took to the streets of a
northern city on Tuesday and fired shots in the air to protest the
arrest of three people on charges of attempting to assassinate the
president, the state news agency ATA reported.
	   The unrest in Shkodra, 85 kilometers (50 miles) north of Tirana,
began in the early afternoon after the arrests. The men were
detained and charged for confronting President Rexhep Mejdani last
week, guns in hand, during his visit to Shkodra.
	   Mejdani walked away from them without incident, and supporters
of the suspects say they were just trying to demonstrate that the
president, a Socialist, was unwanted in Shkodra, a stronghold of
the anti-Communist Democratic Party.
	   A crowd of people who identified themselves as members of
anti-Communist unions gathered in the town's main square demanding
the release of the detained, ATA said. Later, they blocked off part
of the town and some of them started shooting in the air, said ATA,
without giving crowd figures.
	   The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe reported
its office in Shkodra had been looted of computers and other
equipment. Nobody had been hurt, said the organization.
	   The recent incident is expected to sharpen the dispute between
the two biggest political parties in the country. Shkodra is a
stronghold of former President Sali Berisha, who was voted out of
office after months of unrest last year and who figured in more
recent unrest in September, as he demanded the resignation of the
Socialists.
	   Fearing a new escalation of violence in Europe's poorest
country, international organizations are closely monitoring the
situation.
	   Their efforts to persuade the opposition to participate in a
Nov. 22 referendum that would enact the first post-Communist
constitution have failed, as the opposition has declared it will
boycott the plebiscite.
	   Austrian Ambassador Arno Riedel told reporters on Tuesday that
he was concerned about the ``disturbing reports'' coming from
Shkodra. In the name of the European Union _ Austria now holds the
EU's rotating presidency _ he called on Albanians to remain calm.
	   ``If you only work with Kalashnikovs and do not cooperate with
each other, how can you reach European standards in this country?''
he told reporters.

	   GENEVA (AP) _ Former Canadian minister Roy Maclaren faced trade
delegates Tuesday as World Trade Organization members begin the
process of choosing a new leader.
	   Maclaren said he would work to speed the accession of some 30
countries which have applied to join the trade body if chosen.
	   But there is no ``magic formula'' for bringing countries such as
China and Russia on board, he told reporters.
	   The WTO should act as a ``catalyst'' to fuel the development of
the world's poorest countries, Maclaren said.
	   Maclaren, 64, has been Canada's ambassador in London since 1996.
He was Canada's trade minister from 1993 to 1996, negotiating the
final stages of the North American Free Trade Agreement and of the
Uruguay Round of the GATT.
	   He was director of Deutsche Bank in Canada from 1984-1993.
	   The outgoing WTO director-general, Renato Ruggiero of Italy,
will step down by the end of next April.
	   The contest will be decided by consensus rather than a vote and
the WTO general council hopes to confirm the appointment by the end
of this year.
	   The other candidates _ former Moroccan trade minister Hassan
Abouyoub, Thai Deputy Prime Minister Supachai Panitchpakdi, and
Michael Moore, former prime minister of New Zealand _ will also be
in Geneva this week.

Decision on Azerbaijan's oil route delayed again
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A decision on a pipeline route for transporting
the bulk of Azerbaijan's Caspian Sea oil to the West has been
postponed again, this time until early December, an official said
Tuesday.
	   The international consortium of oil companies eager to cash in
on Caspian oil reserves was expected to present its recommendation
on the pipeline route to the Azerbaijani government on Nov. 12.
	   The final announcement on the route is expected to be made by
Azerbaijan's President Geidar Aliev, but he is almost certain to
take the consortium's recommendation.
	   The oil consortium's announcement has been rescheduled until
early December, the ITAR-Tass news agency reported, citing the
chief of Azerbaijan's state-run oil company Natik Aliev _ President
Aliev's son.
	   No reason for the delay was given.
	   President Aliev favors a proposed pipeline through Georgia and
Turkey. Several U.S. oil companies have invested heavily in the
project, and the United States also favors the as-yet-unbuilt
Georgia-Turkey route.
	   An alternate route would go through Iran, a country that
Washington considers unstable and therefore does not want to see
receiving oil revenues. But the Iran route would be cheaper, and
the oil consortium has reportedly favored that option.
	   U.S. officials welcomed a past delay on the decision, saying it
was a good sign for the Georgia-Turkey route.
	   Caspian oil reserves are believed to be the largest outside the
Middle East, but they remain relatively untapped because countries
with access to them have been struggling to get the expensive
projects off the ground and to find a way to export the oil.
	   A smaller pipeline to the Black Sea port of Supsa in Georgia is
expected to start pumping small amounts of oil in April.

Pinochet lawyers say extradition will harm British-Chile relations
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MAUREEN JOHNSON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Lawyers for Gen. Augusto Pinochet told Britain's
highest court Tuesday that upholding the former dictator's arrest
would upset British-Chile relations as well as endanger democracy
developed in Chile since he stepped down in 1990.
	   ``The British government has acquiesced or lent its support to
the process of transition,'' said lawyer Claire Montgomery, arguing
for Pinochet on the fourth day of the hearing in the House of Lords
where he is fighting his Oct. 16 arrest on a Spanish extradition
warrant.
	   ``If judicial restraint was ever called for it is called for in
this case,'' she added.
	   Several of the five judges in the House of Lords interrupted,
questioning her argument that they base a decision on whether it
would upset a foreign government.
	   Ms. Montgomery reiterated that, despite an official finding in
Chile that some 3,000 people were murdered or disappeared at the
hands of the secret police during Pinochet's 1973-90 rule, the
Chilean government has asked for his immunity.
	   Spanish and British prosecutors have appealed an Oct. 28
decision by the High Court quashing Pinochet's arrest on grounds
that as a former foreign head of state he has immunity from
prosecution in this country.
	   The hearing was expected to continue through Wednesday and
perhaps part of Thursday. Judgment will likely be given next week,
court officials said.
	   Pinochet, 82, arrested on allegations of genocide, torture and
kidnapping while recuperating from back surgery in London, remains
in hospital under police guard.
	   Lawyers for the prosecutors, citing the Nuremberg trials of
Nazis after World War II and more recent trials of Bosnian Serbs
and Rwandan Hutus for war crimes or mass murder, say Pinochet, too,
is responsible for deeds beyond immunity.
	   Although 11 proceedings have been instigated against him in
Chile, Pinochet has enjoyed immunity from prosecution there as a
senator for life and under laws he introduced after overthrowing
Salvador Allende, an elected Marxist.
	   Human rights activists said Tuesday proceedings in Chile were
being ``turned on and off'' by the Chilean government as part of an
attempt to get Pinochet released.
	   ``Why all of a sudden is the Chilean government talking about a
trial?'' Reed Brody of the New York-based Human Rights Watch told
reporters after the hearing. ``It is a transparent attempt to
divert the international community from the fact that he has
imposed an immunity on the Chilean people.''
	   Earlier, relatives of people who disappeared during Pinochet's
rule handed in a petition at Prime Minister Tony Blair's Downing
Street office seeking his support.
	   ``For 25 years we have called on the law courts of our own
country to find our loved ones, who were the victims of the hatred
unleashed by security bodies who obeyed the exclusive orders of
Gen. Pinochet,'' said the letter from Sola Sierra, head of the
Association of the Families of the Detained-Disappeared in Chile.
	   ``There was no judicial avenue we did not pursue in Chile or
abroad. All those we pursued in Chile led nowhere,'' it added.

80 years on, Canada's veterans revisit World War One battlefields
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KORTRIJK, Belgium (AP) _ With bittersweet memories, hearts full
of pride and gleam in their eye for the local girls, a small band
of Canadian World War I survivors made the trek back Tuesday to the
battlefields of Flanders.
	   Seventeen veterans, the youngest aged 98, crossed the Atlantic
to pay tribute to the 68,000 Canadians who never made it back home
from the Great War which ended 80 years ago on Nov. 11, 1918.
	   The pilgrimage was painful for some. Thomas Spear, 102, of
Calgary, Alberta, recalled the death of his brother William who
served in the same signals unit and was cut down in Northern France
in September 1918, aged 23. He lies buried there still.
	   ``There's a piece of Canada here forever,'' Spear told reporters
who met the veterans in the medieval town hall of this city that
lay just beyond the World War I frontlines.
	   To his delight, Spear discovered an old comrade on this trip,
Frederick Connett, 101, of West Vancouver, British Columbia, who
served in the same signals unit.
	   ``We lived in the same barracks. We didn't know until now, but
we shared the same food, the same place to sleep ... usually the
stables,'' said Connett with a grin.
	   Led by Canada's Minister of Veterans Affairs Fred J. Miffin, the
veterans are making a 10-day tour of the battlefields that has its
highlight Wednesday when they join Britain's Queen Elizabeth II,
Belgium's King Albert II and veterans from other nations to mark
the anniversary of the armistice.
	   Canadian troops were involved in some of the bloodiest fighting
in the trenches around Ypres just west of here. In April 1915,
Canadians, freshly arrived at the front, were among the first to
experience the terrors of a poison gas attack, and in the fall of
1917 Canadians led an assault through the mud of Passchendaele.
Some 16,000 fell.
	   ``They must have thought they were in hell,'' said Miffin. ``We
can only stop and wonder what fortitude made such men make such
sacrifices.''
	   The veterans modestly downplayed their valor.
	   ``I kept my head down,'' said Percy Perdue, 98, of Nelson,
British Columbia. ``Put your head up and you got it knocked off.''
	   ``We did as we were told, and we did it to the best of
capacity,'' added Spear. ``I felt when I was discharged, that I had
done my duty. I would do it again.''
	   Chests gleaming with medals and berets slanted at jaunty angles,
the veterans enjoyed the attention. When a young female reporter
asked if they lied about their ages now as some did back then to
get into the army, Connett thanked his ``charming'' questioner and
quipped back that pretty girls also lie about their ages.
	   Many recalled the spirit of adventure that led them to sign up
for a war fought half a world away. ``When the rest of my
colleagues and friends enlisted, I thought, why shouldn't I,'' said
asked Fred Gies, 102, of Kitchener, Ontario.
	   But once they arrived in Europe, the innocent enthusiasm was
soon blown away amid the horrors of trench warfare.
	   ``When we got to the war and the bombs started flying around,
that was a different deal altogether,'' recalled Stephan
Thorlakson, 101, of Lillooet, British Columbia. ``We had to take it
and we took it.''
	   ``Mud from head to foot. We lived in mud, we crawled in mud, we
tried to sleep in mud. And that's about it,'' said Harry Routhier,
98, of Langley, British Columbia.

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ In his first major policy speech since
taking office, Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder promised Tuesday to tap
Germans' creativity to put the nation back to work but deftly
avoided specifying his government's political direction.
	   Schroeder pledged in a two-hour inaugural address to undo cuts
in social programs made by his predecessor, yet said he would take
a hard look at the cost of the ample safety net for society's
weakest members _ implying cuts of his own.
	   He also defied attempts to label his administration, saying it
would be neither left nor right, but simply ``modern.''
	   With that he was joining others on Europe's new left such as
British Prime Minister Tony Blair who advocate a ``Third Way''
between naked capitalism and a costly social welfare state.
	   That general theme helped Schroeder unseat longtime leader
Helmut Kohl in September, but his speech added little to define
exactly where he stands.
	   He urged Germans to mobilize their ``creative forces'' and
rekindle a sense of optimism he said had evaporated under Kohl's
16-year conservative reign.
	   With nearly 4 million Germans out of work, the Social Democrat
renewed his campaign pledge to give priority to combating
unemployment stuck above 10 percent.
	   To help, he promised his government would reward private
initiative _ for example, through deregulation and promotion of
individual retirement accounts _ and offered 15 billion marks (dlrs
8.9 billion) in tax relief over the next four years, aimed mainly
at households.
	   ``Unemployment remains our most pressing and most painful
problem,'' Schroeder said. ``We are going turn this country into a
place on the move again.''
	   But his stand on government spending remained unclear.
	   He promised a ``decisive consolidation'' of the budget, saying
that social programs should be aimed only at ``the really needy.''
	   At the same time, he renewed a debate about lower European
interest rates as a way to boost the economy, a worrisome prospect
for the European central bank that takes over monetary policy for
Germany and 10 other countries on Jan. 1.
	   Schroeder's idea seemed to be that government spending will have
to increase if central bankers, who jealously guard their
independence from political meddling, don't cut rates.
	   As the opposition took aim at his policies, Schroeder laughed
and smiled from his seat.
	   The Christian Democrats, now the main opposition party, accused
the new government of favoring an ``easy money policy'' that would
spark inflation.
	   In a combative reply interrupted by catcalls from the government
benches, the party's parliamentary leader, Wolfgang Schaeuble,
criticized Schroeder's speech as revival of old-style left ideas
that was short on substance.
	   But with the left in power in most European countries, Schroeder
insisted there was a ``unique chance'' for a common fight against
unemployment. ``Our goal is a European jobs pact,'' he said.
	   Promising continuity in foreign policy, he said Germany would
remain a loyal U.S. ally and partner in NATO while seeking to raise
Europe's profile in international affairs.
	   Germany also will continue to improve ties with its eastern
neighbors, including Poland and the Czech Republic, he said.
	   Schroeder outlined other goals set by his Social Democrats and
their junior coalition partner, the ecology-minded Greens, for the
new legislature: weaning Germany off nuclear energy, easing
citizenship rules to integrate foreigners, and streamlining
bureaucracy. The coalition has a 21-seat majority in parliament.

Sir Stanley says Wembley will always be Wembley
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WEMBLEY, England (AP) _ Sir Stanley Matthews said Tuesday that
Wembley Stadium will remain the symbol of English soccer even if
the Twin Towers are torn down.
	   ``It's a matter of fact that the Twin Towers have to go,'' the
83-year-old soccer great said. ``But to me the most important thing
is that Wembley is still Wembley, the position is still there, the
stadium is still there.
	   ``Wembley is about the name. If you played Cup Finals in
Manchester or Birmingham it wouldn't be the same. You can't
describe the atmosphere.''
	   Sir Stanley, European Footballer of the Year in 1956, was
honored Tuesday for his performance in the 1953 FA Cup Final at
Wembley _ when he inspired Blackpool's comeback from 3-1 down
against Bolton to win 4-3.
	   England plans to tear down Wembley Stadium next summer to build
a new state-of-the-art venue which could form the centerpiece of
England's bid for the 2006 World Cup.
	   The architects in charge of the project say the towers have to
be removed in order to move the stadium north of its current site
and accommodate the new facilities, including a running track.
	   The news has been greeted with dismay by many players and fans,
who feel the towers are a vital and symbolic feature of the
stadium.
	   Football Association spokesman David Davies said no final
decision had been made yet on whether to remove the towers.
	   ``Everybody wants the finest stadium in the world to be built on
this site and everybody knows the emotional attachment of many,
many people to the Twin Towers,'' he said. ``The question is can we
reconcile those two facts and then pay for it and that's what the
discussions will center on.''
	   Brent Council, which runs the district that includes Wembley,
said it would reject any planning application that does not
safeguard the future of the towers.
	   ``They are an important part of our heritage and we will fight
to keep them,'' John Duff, Brent's environment committee chairman,
said. ``Our planning briefing is to keep the towers and we are not
about to change our minds.''
	   English Heritage, the government body which advises on historic
buildings, said it was still pushing for a design which would
involve shifting the towers rather than pulling them down.

	   TURIN, Italy (AP) _ Croat defender Igor Tudor will move to the
tip of Juventus' offense for Wednesday's Italian Cup match against
Venezia as the Italian league giant also tries to overcome a spate
of injuries with call-ups from its junior reserve team.
	   Tudor, who usually teams with Uruguayan Paolo Montero and
Italian veteran Ciro Ferrara on defense, will move to centeforward
to lead La Juve's offense in the third-round, second-leg game
having drawn 1-1 in the first leg at home two weeks ago.
	   Coach Marcello Lippi said Tuesday he will use the tall Tudor,
who has a reputation for being strong in the air with Uruguayan
forward Daniel Fonseca and with 18-year-old Marco Rigoni, who will
be making his first-team debut.
	   La Juve will be without Alessandro Del Piero, out until March
with a knee injury; French midfielder Didier Deschamps; striker
Filippo Inzaghi; No. 1 keeper Angelo Peruzzi; defender Mark
Iuliano; and midfielders Antonio Conte and Alessio Tacchinardi.
	   Internazionale of Milan will be without Brazilian striker
Ronaldo in Wednesday's match against lightly regarded Castel di
Sangro but will start Italian veteran Roberto Baggio, who has
recovered from tendinitis in his knee.
	   Baggio, signed by Inter in the offseason, has played only a

Russia drafts bill to ban pure alcohol imports
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The government is drafting a decree that would ban
imports of ethyl alcohol into Russia for at least three years, a
news report said Tuesday.
	   Russian cash-strapped government has been trying to tighten
control over the lucrative alcohol business, saying it would be a
crucial way of collecting more taxes.
	   The Cabinet has ordered the Trade Ministry to draft a decree
banning imports of ethyl alcohol, which is used in producing some
alcoholic drinks and medicines, until Jan. 1, 2002, the Interfax
news agency reported.
	   Vladimir Yarmosh, chief of the Spirtprom association of alcohol
producers, said that Russia's distilleries are capable of producing
enough ethyl alcohol ``to meet the needs of the vodka- and
wine-producing plants and the medical industry,'' according to
Interfax.
	   Russia's alcohol industry is rife with fake spirits and illegal
imports, and the government estimates that profits on about half of
the country's alcohol production escapes tax officials each year.

Israel's Cabinet to reconvene to ratify peace accord

	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ After two weeks of delays, Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu announced he would convene his Cabinet on
Wednesday to ratify the land-for-security agreement with the
Palestinians.
	   Netanyahu said Tuesday he made the decision after getting new
assurances that the Palestinian Authority would take ``practical
steps'' against Islamic militants.
	   U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright had urged Netanyahu
to stick to the original 12-week timetable of the accord under
which Israel is to withdraw from 13 percent of the West Bank by the
end of January, in exchange for a Palestinian anti-terror campaign.
	   If the Cabinet ratifies the agreement Wednesday, Israel might
still be able to meet its first commitment _ an initial troop
pullback Monday from 2 percent of the West Bank.
	   Before Tuesday's announcement that Israel's 18-member Cabinet
would convene Wednesday, Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat
complained that Netanyahu was willfully delaying implementation.
	   ``We expect that Netanyahu will waste a lot of time and he's not
going to implement the agreement honestly and quickly at all,''
Arafat said.
	   A senior Palestinian negotiator had also warned the Palestinians
might stop fulfilling their commitments under the accord, including
a crackdown on Islamic militants, if Israel's Cabinet did not
ratify the U.S.-brokered agreement in the next few days.
	   ``Implementation cannot be unilateral. It must be mutual and
reciprocal,'' Palestinian negotiator Hasan Asfour told reporters.
	   In the past two weeks, Netanyahu postponed the Cabinet debate
three times, saying he needed more clarifications from the
Palestinians about their campaign against Islamic militants.
	   It was delayed a fourth time on Friday after two members of the
Islamic Jihad group blew up their rigged car in a Jerusalem market,
killing themselves and wounding 21 Israeli shoppers.
	   Netanyahu had said he would not reconvene the ministers until
the Palestinian Authority outlined how it would prevent attacks
against Israelis in the future.
	   Netanyahu said in a statement Tuesday that he decided to
reconvene the Cabinet after ``receiving reports that the
Palestinian Authority decided to take practical steps against
Palestinian terror groups and their infrastructure.'' He did not
elaborate.
	   However, Netanyahu also introduced a new snag.
	   He suggested he would stop the troop withdrawal process in the
middle if the Palestinians did not meet an Israeli demand
concerning the procedure for revoking clauses of the PLO charter
that call for Israel's destruction.
	   The Israel-Palestinian agreement negotiated last month in
Maryland says the Palestine National Council and other Palestinian
organizations will meet in mid-December to ``reaffirm'' a January
letter from Arafat to President Clinton that lists the PLO charter
clauses considered annulled.
	   But Israel insists the agreement requires the PNC to take a
formal vote; the Palestinians say only approval of the letter by
acclamation is required.
	   In Tuesday's statement, Netanyahu said that it the Cabinet
approves the agreement, ``it will add ... the following
stipulation: the implementation of the rest of the agreement will
be conditional on the PNC convening and voting to change the
charter.''
	   Israel radio said the Cabinet would also discuss the paving of
bypass roads for Jewish settlers in the West Bank.
	   One of the projects to be discussed is a road near the
Palestinian refugee camp of Al Aroub that would require the
confiscation of thousands of acres of Palestinian land.
	   Israeli military commanders oppose the Al Aroub road, fearing
the massive land confiscation could lead to Palestinian riots, the
Haaretz daily said.

FA appoints first anti-corruption official
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ A 37-year-old police officer has been appointed as
the England Football Association's front man in the fight against
corruption and misconduct in the national game.
	   Graham Bean, who has served as national chairman of the Football
Supporters Association for the past two years, was appointed
Tuesday as the FA's first ``compliance officer.'' He takes up the
post in January.
	   The FA said Bean's role will be to oversee issues of financial
irregularities, drug abuse, racism, violent play and general
misconduct.
	   ``As compliance officer, he will be responsible for
investigating and, where appropriate, prosecuting disciplinary
cases and alleged breaches of the FA's rules and regulations,'' an
FA statement said.
	   ``He will also be responsible for developing best practice in
the game as a whole through the promotion of codes of conduct and
policies such as anti-discrimination and child protection.''
	   In high-profile cases of alleged misconduct, Bean will
investigate and make recommendations to FA chief executive Graham
Kelly, who remains the overall decision-maker.
	   If a personal hearing is requested before an FA disciplinary
committee, Bean will take on the role of prosecutor.
	   The role of a compliance officer was first proposed in a report
to the FA last year in the wake of cases of kickbacks and other
financial misconduct by managers and agents.
	   Bean has spent 14 of his 18 years' service as a detective with
the South Yorkshire Police. As well as general criminal
investigation, he has served with the force's serious crime, drugs
and fraud squads.

Business execs, UEFA clash over control of sport
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By RAF CASERT &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ Television and entertainment executives
on Tuesday accused European soccer authorities of trying to
maintain a monopoly over soccer competition and downplayed fears of
a big-business takeover.
	   At a public hearing in the European Parliament, UEFA Deputy
Secretary General Markus Studer countered that encroaching business
interests would almost inevitably undermine the integrity of the
game and called on Europe's politicians to stand by UEFA.
	   Rupert Murdoch's BSkyB television network defended its planned
takeover of English club Manchester United.
	   The takeover ``would never be detrimental to the foundation of
the sport,'' said Jonathan Sykes, BSkyB's head of business and
commercial affairs.
	   Studer argued BSkyB, which already holds England's Premier
League television rights, was only one purchase away from creating
a nefarious triangle.
	   ``Imagine the scenario when a match is played between two teams
owned by Sky, with Sky holding the television contract as well,''
he told the European parliamentarians.
	   The European Union is increasingly being called on to rule on
disputes between the soccer authorities and business interests. The
EU's executive Commission is investigating no less than 55 cases.
	   The Manchester United deal is under review from Britain's
Monopolies and Mergers Commission, and UEFA is expected to
investigate whether to extend limits on soccer ownership to include
teams being owned by television rights holders.
	   UEFA already has instituted a ban on common ownership of teams
playing in the same European competition, but the rule has been
successfully challenged by the British entertainment corporation
ENIC PLC at the Lausanne-based Court of Arbitration for Sport.
	   ENIC owns four clubs across Europe. Its managing director Daniel
Levy claimed UEFA wanted ``to preserve its monopoly position as a
provider of European competitions'' by barring common ownership of
clubs.
	   UEFA's Studer challenged the notion and argued common ownership
would only increase the potential for match-rigging.
	   ``Is (there) a danger if two soccer clubs owned by the same
company play against each other? I think you will find the answer
pretty clear,'' Studer said.
	   Not so, countered Levy.
	   ``Club owners realize that trying to fix a match or the
appearance of a conflict dramatically erodes the value of their
investment,'' he said. ``The whole value of the team will
plummet.''
	   Levy proposed a code of ethics for multi-team owners, including
transparent management, minority shareholders involved in only one
of the teams and local directors on the club.

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ U.S. and British threats of a military
strike are ``a reckless act,'' Iraq's foreign minister said,
calling for a political solution to the dispute over U.N. weapons
inspections.
	   The minister, Mohammed Saeed al-Sahhaf, said in an interview
late Monday on Qatari television that military action would ``lead
to destabilizing the region.''
	   He called on the U.N. Security Council to respond to Iraq's
demand that a review of Iraq's compliance with U.N. resolutions
ending the 1991 Gulf War lead to the lifting of sanctions.
	   Al-Sahhaf said the Security Council should be ``given a genuine
opportunity _ free from all Anglo-Saxon pressures _ to conduct a
comprehensive review of the situation that is acceptable to all
parties.''
	   This, he said, should ``lead us to start the process of lifting
the embargo on Iraq.''
	   ``As for those screaming and threatening the use of force, this
is nothing but a reckless act in the region,'' al-Sahhaf said.
	   In using the phrase ``Anglo-Saxon pressures,'' al-Sahhaf
referred to threats by the United States and Britain to use
military action after Iraq announced Oct. 31 it was halting
cooperation with the U.N. Special Commission.
	   The commission is responsible for overseeing the destruction of
Iraq's chemical and biological weapons as well as its long-range
missiles.
	   It must certify that Iraq has eliminated its weapons of mass
destruction before the Security Council will lift the sanctions,
which limit Iraq's sale of oil, its economic mainstay.
	   Iraq's announcement that it would stop cooperating with the
commission came one day after the Security Council agreed to review
the country's compliance with U.N. resolutions. But it did not
accede to Iraq's demand that this be linked to lifting the
sanctions.
	   Al-Sahhaf said ``intensive contacts'' were under way, including
with U.N. envoy Prakash Shah, to resolve the impasse. After a
three-day visit, former Irish Prime Minister Albert Reynolds left
Iraq on Monday pledging to lobby Britain and the United States to
avoid using force and to seek a negotiated settlement.
	   British Defense Secretary George Robertson warned during a visit
Monday to Kuwait that the patience of the international community
was ``drifting away'' and that ``the option of force is there, is
real.''
	   But Iraqi Trade Minister Mohammed Mehdi Saleh told reporters
Tuesday that Iraq does not fear a U.S. military strike. He also
said America would be the loser and Iraq the winner, implying that
Baghdad would gain Arab sympathy.
	   President Bill Clinton met with senior Pentagon officials
Tuesday to explore options for diplomacy and a possible military
attack.
	   White House press secretary Joe Lockhart said the meeting should
send Iraqi President Saddam Hussein the message that ``all options
remain on the table should he decide on his current course.''
	   And Defense Secretary William Cohen told reporters Tuesday that
the USS Enterprise aircraft carrier and a group of Marine warships
were moving into the region in case the United States decides to
attack.
	   Meanwhile, the state-run daily Al-Qadissiya reported Tuesday
that Iraq's vice president, Taha Yassin Ramadan, told a visiting
journalist that Iraq's Oct. 31 decision is ``a logical, just and
legal right'' of the country and that Iraq would not reverse it.
	   He accused the United States of ``hollow threats'' and said
military action would only strengthen Iraq's determination to end
the embargo.
	   Also Tuesday, five teams from the International Atomic Energy
Agency went into the field, the largest number so far this month,
U.N. spokeswoman Caroline Cross said.
	   Iraq's decision to suspend cooperation with U.N. weapons
monitors exempted the IAEA, which is close to declaring Iraq free
of nuclear weapons.

	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ Poland launched commemorations Tuesday to
mark regaining independence in 1918, joined by presidents from
Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania and Ukraine.
	   As part of the commemorations, parliament approved a resolution
praising the survival of patriotism and the spirit of freedom
during the 123 years that Poland was partitioned by Austria,
Prussia and Russia.
	   President Aleksander Kwasniewski, once affiliated with the party
of ex-comunists rousted from control in elections last year by the
Solidarity bloc, said the anniversary showed how strong Poles could
be when they rose above political squabbling and worked for a
single purpose.
	   ``This is a great anniversary which summons the spirit of
agreement among different forces,'' Kwasniewski said.
	   For its part, Solidarity included in the resolution that this
same patriotism inspired the formation of the pro-democracy
Solidarity movement in 1980 and the downfall of communism nine
years later.
	   In Krakow, former president and Solidarity founder Lech Walesa
laid flowers at the tomb of Marshall Jozef Pilsudski, considered a
father of the fight for independence.
	   Attending the parliament session were World War I veterans,
diplomats and church representatives, along with Greek Prime
Minister Kostas Simitis and his Polish counterpart Jerzy Buzek.
	   Later Tuesday, Polish and visiting officials attended a gala
concert at Warsaw's Grand Theater. The president of Romania arrives
Wednesday; he and other visiting presidents will watch the changing
of the guard at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier.

Analyst: Russia may have no money to destroy chemical weapons
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia may not have enough money to destroy its
huge stockpile of chemical weapons properly and might resort to
burning them, which would poison the environment, a prominent
analyst said Tuesday.
	   Russia has an estimated 44,000 tons of deteriorating chemical
weapons that it promised to destroy when it ratified the
international Chemical Weapons Convention last year.
	   The United States has given Russia dlrs 200 million for
destroying the stockpile, said Alexander Pikayev, an expert on the
program from the Moscow office of the Carnegie Endowment for
International Peace.
	   But the total cost of the program _ which includes painstaking
dismantling and disposal _ is estimated at dlrs 5.7 billion and
Russia may not be able to come up with its share of the funding,
Pikayev said, according to the Interfax news agency.
	   ``If the program falls through, the chemicals will have to be
destroyed in an outdated way by incineration, which is appalling
for the environment,'' he was quoted as saying. The report did not
elaborate on the potential damage.
	   Russia says it stopped producing chemical weapons in 1987, but
its stockpile remains the largest in the world.

Former mayor drops out of presidential race after Chavez victories
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) _ A former Caracas mayor dropped out of
the presidential race Tuesday, two days after a leftist coalition
led by a former coup leader dominated congressional elections.
	   Claudio Fermin, 48, an independent who split last year from
Venezuela's largest political party, Democratic Action, said he had
not decided if he would back another candidate.
	   A poll last month by Caracas-based Datanalisis gave him only 2.6
percent support among voters. Fermin was Democratic Action's
presidential candidate in 1993.
	   Former paratrooper Hugo Chavez, the leader of a failed 1992 coup
attempt, is ahead in all polls for the Dec. 6 presidential race.
Another independent, Yale-educated businessman Henrique Salas
Romer, is in second place.
	   Chavez's Patriotic Pole won 34 percent of congressional seats on
Sunday, while traditional political parties Democratic Action won
22 percent and the Social Christian Copei won 11 percent, according
to initial results.
	   The Patriotic Pole also took 8 out of 23 governorships in states
which account for more than a third of Venezuela's population.
	   The results thrilled millions of poor Venezuelans fed up with
rampant corruption but sent shudders through the upper-class, who
fear he will impose a leftist dictatorship.

	   GENEVA (AP) _ Former Canadian minister Roy Maclaren faced trade
delegates Tuesday as World Trade Organization members begin the
process of choosing a new leader.
	   Maclaren said he would work to speed the accession of some 30
countries which have applied to join the trade body if chosen.
	   But there is no ``magic formula'' for bringing countries such as
China and Russia on board, he told reporters.
	   The WTO should act as a ``catalyst'' to fuel the development of
the world's poorest countries, Maclaren said.
	   Maclaren, 64, has been Canada's ambassador in London since 1996.
He was Canada's trade minister from 1993 to 1996, negotiating the
final stages of the North American Free Trade Agreement and of the
Uruguay Round of the GATT.
	   He also was director of Deutsche Bank in Canada from 1984-1993.
	   The outgoing WTO director-general, Renato Ruggiero of Italy,
will step down in April next year.
	   The contest will be decided by consensus rather than a vote, and
the WTO general council hopes to confirm the appointment by year's
end.
	   The other candidates _ former Moroccan trade minister Hassan
Abouyoub, Thai Deputy Prime Minister Supachai Panitchpakdi, and
Michael Moore, former prime minister of New Zealand _ will also be
in Geneva this week.

<TEXT>
	   TURIN, Italy (AP) _ League champion Juventus will start a Croat
defender as centerforward and some players from its junior teams in
Wednesday's Italian Cup round to make up for a streak of injuries
which have sidelined key players and severely cut an original
23-man roster.
	   Igor Tudor, who usually teams with Uruguayan Paolo Montero and
Italian veteran Ciro Ferrara in defense, will lead La Juve offense
in the third-round second-leg game of the Italian Cup against
low-ranked Venezia.
	   Coach Marcello Lippi said Tuesday that Tudor, who's tall and
good in headers, will team in front with Uruguayan forward Daniel
Fonseca and with 18-year-old Marco Rigoni, making his debut on the
major team.
	   La Juve, which will be playing Venezia on the road following a
disappointing 1-1 draw at home, will be without star-forward
Alessandro Del Piero, sidelined through March with a bad knee
injury, French midfielder Didier Deschamps, striker Filippo
Inzaghi, No.1 keeper Angelo Peruzzi, defender Mark Iuliano and
midfielders Antonio Conte and Alessio Tacchinardi.
	   Internazionale of Milan will miss its Brazilian superstar
Ronaldo in Wednesday's match against underdog Castel di Sangro but
will start Italian veteran star Roberto Baggio, recovered from a
knee tendinitis.
	   Baggio, signed by Inter in the offseason, has played a few games
with his new team.
	   Inter, which tied AC Milan 1-1 Sunday following three
consecutive losses in league games, starts from a 1-0 first-leg
lead against Castel di Sangro, a third-division team.
	   Ronaldo, repeatedly off and on the team in his troubled season
start, is sidelined with a light left knee injury. However team
doctors said he will be on the starting lineup in Sunday's league
match against Sampdoria.
	   German striker Oliver Bierhoff, French midfielder Ibrahim Ba and
veteran defender Alessandro Costacurta are suspended on AC Milan
side as the former powerhouse will try to reverse at San Siro
stadium a 3-1 first-leg loss to Lazio of Rome.
	   Lazio, the defending Italian Cup champion, starts Chilean
striker Marcelo Salas, who tallied three goals in the last two
games against Partizan and Empoli.
	   Other Italian Cup games Wednesday, with the qualifiers moving
into the quarterfinals, include Parma vs. Bari, Bologna vs.
Sampdoria and Vicenza vs. Udinese.
	   League leader Fiorentina played second-division Lecce Tuesday
night.
	   AS Roma will take on Atalanta of Bergamo in the game completing
the third round Thursday.

Hurricane aid effort in Honduras lacks organization

	   EL PORTILLO, Honduras (AP) _ Slowly, the villagers emerged from
behind the rotting, broken stalks of corn as if they'd stumbled
onto their own field of dreams.
	   Their faces were gaunt, dirty _ and smiling.
	   Somehow, a U.S. Army helicopter had spotted their community
nestled between two mountains 20 miles (35 kilometers) south of
Tegucigalpa. El Portillo was too small to appear on the pilot's
map, but the earnest waves of its children were clearly too large
to ignore.
	   Aid for victims of Hurricane Mitch has poured into this Central
American country since the storm hit late last month. But there has
been confusion about where help is most needed and how to deliver
it.
	   As the residents of El Portillo learned, sometimes help comes
just by dumb luck.
	   ``There is no highway. The bridge collapsed,'' a weary Guadalupe
Barahona told Hugh Parmer, assistant administrator for humanitarian
response for the U.S. Agency for International Development.
	   Dozens of the 500 villagers of El Portillo crowded around Parmer
in the corn field, touching him, hugging him, thanking him _ before
he had even given out a grain of rice. They seemed unaware of the
insects nesting in their hair or the caked mud between their bare
toes.
	   Mitch didn't kill anyone in El Portillo, but it destroyed many
homes and the only road leading to food and medicine. Across
Central America, the storm killed roughly 10,000 and left hundreds
of thousands homeless.
	   ``We have nothing,'' one man said, without a hint of
exaggeration in his voice.
	   He still might have nothing if Parmer had not been doing an
aerial survey of Mitch's destruction.
	   The country hardest hit by the storm has been slow to organize
the tons of relief supplies coming in from all corners of the
world.
	   The massive destruction in the capital of Tegucigalpa and
elsewhere has left many in shock at the magnitude of need. The lack
of a coordinated relief command means some areas may go wanting
while others may get more than they need. There are no
comprehensive records of supplies received or where they are most
needed.
	   In contrast, Managua, the capital of neighboring Nicaragua, was
largely unscathed by the storm and now serves as a clearinghouse
for all sorts of supplies, from blankets to plastic roof sheeting
to beans.
	   Nicaraguan and U.S. military officials meet daily to coordinate
aid efforts.
	   Some Nicaraguans accused their government of being slow to act
and basing delivery on political considerations. Following the
criticism, most supplies there now are distributed by the Roman
Catholic Church.
	   ``It would certainly appear to me the Nicaraguan relief effort
is more organized and operating several days ahead (of Honduras),''
Parmer said after meeting with U.S. AID officials in each country.
	   ``That may be a result of the magnitude of the damage,'' he
said.
	   Even so, Nicaraguan Health Minister Martha McCoy said Tuesday
that a lack of helicopters has hampered efforts to reach some areas
suffering outbreaks of conjunctivitis, as well as a few cases of
cholera.
	   ``In very many areas there is no potable water,'' she told local
television, ``and they are taking water from creeks that could be
infected by cadavers that have not yet been recovered, or by dead
animals.''
	   Central to Honduras' problem is a lack of information. Nearly
two weeks after Mitch first hit, some Honduran communities still
have not been reached by phone, by foot, by truck or by air.
	   El Portillo was one of them.
	   The U.S. Army Blackhawks left five 110-pound (50-kilo) bags of
rice _ enough to feed 250 people for three days. Parmer promised to
send antibiotics and other medicines for the rash of conjunctivitis
and upper respiratory problems there.
	   Aid officials say villages such as El Portillo are expected to
rebound faster than cities because residents are accustomed to
isolation and have learned to ration their supplies.
	   Because helicopter flights are costly and inefficient, officials
say they hope to rapidly rebuild roads so that trucks can carry
goods.
	   U.S. Ambassador James Creagan said more rural airstrips are
being repaired so that larger, fixed-wing aircraft can deliver
supplies.
	   ``We all have a frustration when we can't get aid to all the
communities that need it,'' he said.

 &UR; EDS: UPDATES with AC Milan-Lazio detail in new grafs 9-10 &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TURIN, Italy (AP) _ Croat defender Igor Tudor will move to the
tip of Juventus' offense for Wednesday's Italian Cup match against
Venezia as the Italian league giant also tries to overcome a spate
of injuries with call-ups from its junior reserve team.
	   Tudor, who usually teams with Uruguayan Paolo Montero and
Italian veteran Ciro Ferrara on defense, will move to centeforward
to lead La Juve's offense in the third-round, second-leg game
having drawn 1-1 in the first leg at home two weeks ago.
	   Coach Marcello Lippi said Tuesday he will use the tall Tudor,
who has a reputation for being strong in the air with Uruguayan
forward Daniel Fonseca and with 18-year-old Marco Rigoni, who will
be making his first-team debut.
	   La Juve will be without Alessandro Del Piero, out until March
with a knee injury; French midfielder Didier Deschamps; striker
Filippo Inzaghi; No. 1 keeper Angelo Peruzzi; defender Mark
Iuliano; and midfielders Antonio Conte and Alessio Tacchinardi.
	   Internazionale of Milan will be without Brazilian striker
Ronaldo in Wednesday's match against lightly regarded Castel di
Sangro but will start Italian veteran Roberto Baggio, who has
recovered from tendinitis in his knee.
	   Baggio, signed by Inter in the offseason, has played only a
handful of games with his new team.
	   Inter, which drew 1-1 with AC Milan on Sunday following three
consecutive league losses, enters Wednesday's match with a 1-0
first-leg lead against Castel di Sangro, a third-division team.
	   Ronaldo, who has played intermittently with Inter since the
World Cup, is sidelined with a sore left knee. Team doctors,
however, said he will be return for Sunday's league match against
Sampdoria.
	   German striker Oliver Bierhoff, French midfielder Ibrahim Ba and
veteran defender Alessandro Costacurta are suspended as AC Milan
tries at San Siro Stadium to overcome a 3-1 first-leg loss to Lazio
of Rome.

<TEXT>
	   TBILISI, Georgia (AP) _ Unidentified attackers threw a grenade
in the window of a political group's headquarters Tuesday, hours
before 15 members of the group were sentenced for an assassination
attempt against Georgia's president.
	   Nearly a year after the trial began, Georgia's Supreme Court
sentenced the ``Horsemen'' group's former leader, Dzhaba Ioseliani,
to 11 years in prison. Former Deputy Security Minister Temur
Khachishvili was sentenced to 15 years in prison, and 13 other men
of the Horsemen, or Mkhedrioni, received prison terms from seven to
15 years.
	   The men were convicted for masterminding an Aug. 29, 1995, bomb
attack on the motorcade of Georgian President Eduard Shevardnadze,
in which the Georgian leader was cut by flying glass.
	   The trial began last December. Ioseliani and his colleagues, who
denied the accusations, forced delays in the trial by going on
hunger strikes and shouting in the courtroom.
	   Hours before the Supreme Court was expected to hand down the
sentences, a grenade blast seriously damaged the headquarters of
the Horsemen group. The overnight attacks injured a security guard,
said Interior Ministry spokeswoman Maya Mosidze.
	   The Horsemen vowed after the sentencing to step up attacks on
Georgian authorities and strengthen its own infrastructure, said
Tornike Berishvili, a member of the group's governing body.
	   Ioseliani, who helped Shevardnadze return to power in the former
Soviet republic in 1992, split with the president three years later
after Georgia's government outlawed the Horsemen, then an armed
militia, for alleged involvement in a number of crimes.
	   Ioseliani is one of Georgia's most enigmatic figures, a
convicted robber turned playwright and university professor, who
then became heavily enmeshed in Georgian politics.

Deputies press for legalization of cremation
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ In a country were it is illegal to burn
the dead, a group of deputies on Tuesday submitted ground breaking
legislation to allow the cremation of non-Orthodox Christians.
	   The move by 13 leading deputies in the 300-member parliament was
seen as a first step towards eventually legalizing cremation for
all faiths.
	   ``It sets out the provisions that will allow someone who
declares, while still living, that he wants to be cremated to have
his wish fulfilled,'' the proposed legislation said.
	   Greece's powerful Orthodox Church has in the past fought against
allowing cremation, but said it would not oppose this legislation.
	   ``We do not approve of cremation for Orthodox, but we have no
opposition to this,'' said Church spokesman Father Theoklitos
Koumadianos.
	   Not much opposition was expected in the unicameral parliament as
the legislation was signed by leading members of the governing
Socialist party and conservative and leftist groups.
	   To make things easier, it was also tacked on to a bill dealing
with the finances of local government. It was not yet known when
that bill will be debated.
	   Past attempts to legalize cremation have run into strong
opposition from the influential church. Nearly all of the country's
10.2 million people are baptized into the Orthodox Church of
Greece.
	   Koumadianos said the church was opposed to cremation because it
went against its traditions, did not respect the dead, and went
against the Christian belief of the resurrection of the dead
following the second coming of the Messiah.
	   ``We say that in our church there is no cremation. We believe
the dead body has to be honored after death, and then there is
issue of the resurrection of the dead,'' Koumadianos said.
	   But some theologians here say there is no specific ban against
cremation in church texts.
	   ``What if someone is burned to death in an accident or war? Does
that mean there is no resurrection. It doesn't make sense to ban
cremation,'' said Prof. George Moustakis, a theologian.
	   The Roman Catholic Church opposed cremation until 1960, but
still asks that a family hold the funeral first with an intact body
_ or hold the funeral without the body present.

	   By HARALD MOLLERSTROM &QC; 
	   Associated Press Writer &QC; 
	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ Australian qualifier Wayne Arthurs
Tuesday upset second-seed Karol Kucera of Slovakia to set up a
second-round clash against American Todd Martin in the dlrs 825,000
Stockholm Open tennis tournament.
	   Arthurs, a 27-year-old doubles specialist from Adelaide, beat
the highly (7th) ranked Slovak 7-6 (7-5), 7-6 (7-4). The
Australian, who started the year at 282:nd in the ATP ranking and
improved to 168 before this tournament, is bound improve his
standing.
	   After trading service games midway through the first set, both
players held service to 6-6. Arthurs jumped to a 4-1-lead in the
tiebreak winning 7-5 on his first match point.
	   Arthurs seemed to lose control of the match early in the second
set dropping his service for a 2-0-lead for Kucera. But he
recovered and finally won the second tibreaker 7-4 for his sixth
singles win on the ATP tour and the biggest in his career.
	   ``My plan was to serve well, attack on Kuceras second serve and
win at the net,'' the Aussie lefthander said.
	   ``I had nothing to lose. If I lost nobody would cared, if I won
everybody would be very surprised,'' he added.
	   Earlier Tuesday Todd Martin powered his way into the second
round by whipping Swiss qualifier Ivo Heuburger 6-1, 6-2.
	   Martin, who has played impressively the last few weeks,
expressed satisfaction with his game recently and hoped to go far
in the tournament.
	   ``I will not predict how far, but this is a good surface for me.
If I can repeat the level of play I have achieved in the last few
weeks, I will certainly move up in the ATP ranking next year,''
said Martin, currently 22nd.
	   Martin reached the final in the 1996 Stockholm Open but lost to
Thomas Enqvist, a former two-fold winner of the tournament who was
upset Monday by lowly-ranked Japanese Takao Suzuki.
	   In other action Tuesday French veteran Cedric Pioline defeated
wild-card entry Andreas Vinciguerra of Sweden 6-3, 7-5 while Daniel
Nestor of Canada beat Johan van Herck, Belgium 6-3, 7-6 (7-2).
	   Pioline dominated his match but was sometimes challenged by
hard-hitting Vinciguerra.
	   Seven of the world's top 20 players entered in the tennis
tournament, one of the oldest indoors on the ATP circuit, that
began Monday.
	   On Wednesday, top seed Pete Sampras was poised to continue his
quest to finish 1998 ranked No. 1 for a record sixth straight year.
His scheduled opponent was Australian Jason Stoltenberg who has
lost to Sampras the four times they've met. .

Bremen coach wants to introduce 40-hour work week
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BREMEN, Germany (AP) _ New Werder Bremen coach Felix Magath
thinks his players have it too good and he wants to introduce a
40-hour work week in the Bundesliga club.
	   ``You'll never find anybody in the free-market economy who earns
millions for working three hours a day,'' Magath was quoted as
saying Tuesday in the latest edition of the Sport-Bild magazine.
	   ``I have the feeling that players here have it to good,'' Magath
told the magazine.
	   Magath is known for his tough practice demands and iron
discipline. The former Hamburg star became coach at Werder Bremen
last month after the firing of Wolfgang Sidka.

Former prime minister acquitted in bombings trial
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MOHAMED OSMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) _ A military tribunal acquitted Tuesday a
leading opposition leader and 16 others in a bombing case for lack
of evidence but sentenced one person to life imprisonment, Sudanese
radio reported.
	   Two more opposition activists were sentenced to two and three
years in prison, the radio said.
	   Of the 17 people acquitted, 15 were tried in absentia, including
former Prime Minister Sadiq el-Mahdi, his son Abdel-Rahman and
former Agriculture Minister Omar Nur-Eldayem.
	   The case stemmed from two bombings in February in the city of
Wadi Madani, 150 kilometers (94 miles) southeast of Khartoum. The
explosions claimed no lives but damaged some buildings.
	   Five people were caught by security forces after planting
explosives at a government building and a service station.
	   One of them, Rahmat-Allah el-Bashir Idriss, was sentenced to
life. He and the other two men who received the short prison terms
confessed to receiving trailing on explosives in an opposition camp
in neighboring Eritrea, the radio said.
	   Prosecutors claimed the camp was under the control of el-Mahdi,
the former prime minister.
	   The court, however, found no evidence apart from the statements
of the accused incriminating el-Mahdi personally and the 14 others,
who were all tried in absentia. They were charged with involvement
in the plot.
	   The ruling of military tribunals can not be appealed but the
defendants can apply for clemency to the head of state.
	   El-Mahdi was overthrown in a 1989 bloodless coup by current
President Lt. Gen. Omar el-Bashir. He fled Sudan in 1996 to
Eritrea.
	   El-Mahdi's Umma Party has joined hands with the Sudan People's
Liberation Army, a guerrilla group, in a larger opposition
alliance-in-exile against el-Bashir's government.
	   The SPLA has been fighting since 1983 for greater autonomy for
the southern districts, which are predominantly Christian and
animist, and resent the authority of the Islamist north.

Police in Southern India seize land mines
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HYDERABAD, India (AP) _ Police in a southern Indian state that
is wracked by secessionist violence seized 277 land mines that had
been laid on a dirt road, police said Tuesday.
	   The mines were recovered Monday night on a road connecting two
villages several kilometers (miles) apart in Warangal district in
northern Andhra Pradesh state, police said.
	   The area is home to the Peoples' War Group, a Maoist guerrilla
organization fighting police in their quest to carve out a homeland
for tribals who live in that region.
	   ``The land mines were laid in a zig zag manner so that their
target vehicles do not escape from the explosion'', police officer
R.P.Thakar said.
	   Police recovered the mines after a 12-hour operation, he said.
He did not give other details of the seizure.
	   The area is 170 kilometers (105 miles) north of Hyderabad, the
state capital.
	   The guerrillas have in the past attacked police and government
officials, whom they accuse of helping rich farm owners in
exploiting farm hands and tribals.
	   More than 5,500 people, including some 300 policemen, have died
in land mine blasts in the 18-year fight by the group, which also
operates in three adjoining states.

	   MINSK, Belarus (AP) _ A schoolteacher threw herself and her
3-year-old son in front of an oncoming train in eastern Belarus on
Tuesday, and both were immediately killed, officials said.
	   The 37-year-old woman left no note, but police said it appeared
to be suicide, said Alexei Taranov, spokesman for the prosecutor's
office.
	   An investigation was under way into the incident, which occurred
on railroad tracks outside Mogilev, about 210 kilometers (12 miles)
east of Minsk, the Belarusian capital.
	   The woman was a teacher at a middle school in Mogilev. No other

U.N. refugee agency cites security concerns in central Africa

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ Two Sudanese have been killed in an attack on the
Mboki refugee camp in the Central African Republic, a spokesman for
the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees said Tuesday.
	   UNHCR staffers and some private relief workers were threatened
in the attack, apparently by Sudanese rebels, last Friday, said
Kris Janowski.
	   After gunfire was heard in the area again Monday, several relief
workers were flown by U.N. military observers to Bangui, the
republic's capital, but other relief workers stayed at the
settlement, Janowski told reporters.
	   At UNHCR's request the republic flew in 30 government troops
Monday to reinforce the one police officer who was present at Mboki
at the time of the raid, he said.
	   Janowski said the incident was similar to an Oct. 3 assault on a
refugee center in Congo by the Sudanese People's Liberation Army,
which looted UNHCR offices and chased refugees across the border
back into Sudan, Janowski said.
	   Some 35,000 Sudanese refugees live in the Central African
Republic settlement at Mboki, which is spread over 40 square
kilometers near the Sudanese and Congolese borders.
	   According to humanitarian workers in southern Sudan, 17,000 of
the 61,000 refugees in Congo have returned to the Yambio area since
the raid Oct. 3.
	   Janowski said the agency also is ``extremely concerned'' about
another potential source of instability in central Africa _ the
disappearance of ``significant numbers'' of Rwandan men from
refugee camps in the Republic of Congo.
	   ``We fear they may take up arms'' in neighboring Congo, he said.
	   New fighters would add to the turmoil in the country, where the
government and its allies face a rebellion supported by other
African countries.
	   ``UNHCR has condemned the recruitment of refugees and asylum
seekers for military action in the past, and has appealed to states
to take all necessary measures to prevent activities which could
further destabilize the region,'' Janowski said.

	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Police launched a search Tuesday for four
Chinese thought to have kidnapped two of their fellow nationals
visiting Greece.
	   Police said two Chinese tourists, identified as Wang Sam, 28,
and Guo Xiaoyang, 20, were allegedly kidnapped by the four in the
southern port of Patras while waiting for a ferry boat to Italy.
	   According to police, they were brought to Athens and Xiaoyang,
who is eight months pregnant, was made to call her family in China
to ask for ransom. Police did not provide a hometown for the two
tourists nor say what the ransom was.
	   Both were robbed, bound and left in a central Athens apartment,
police said. A ransom was not paid, police said.
	   They managed to free themselves Tuesday, but were slightly
injured when they jumped from the apartment's third-floor balcony.

Businessmen urge government to lower interest rates to revive

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SAO PAULO, Brazil (AP) _ With recession amd record unemployment
knocking at the door, Brazilian business people are urging the
government to lower interest rates to revive South America's
largest economy.
	   What's more, they warn, unless annual interest rates of nearly
50 percent start coming down, the government's recently announced
fiscal austerity package runs the risk of falling apart.
	   A document prepared by the National Confederation of Industries
points out that continued high interest rates will increase the
public deficit _ now at 7 percent of gross domestic product _ and
lower tax collection as economic output dwindles.
	   In late October, the government unveiled a mix of taxes and
spending cuts in a bid to save nearly dlrs 24 billion in 1999 and
some dlrs 80 billion by 2002. The measures must be approved by
Congress.
	   Analysts say the program is likely to provoke a recession and
push unemployment above its current official rate of 7.8 percent.
Independent economists say unemployment is closer to 20 percent.
	   As part of its belt-tightening measures, the government on
Monday released a new budget blueprint that slashed spending by 8.7
billion reals (dlrs 7.3 billion). That would be 17 percent less
than in the budget first presented to Congress in August.
	   The government hopes the measures will qualify Brazil for an
International Monetary Fund rescue package, expected to be
announced this week.
	   The IMF has insisted on a tough plan to slash Brazil's deficit
before going ahead with an estimated dlrs 30 billion to dlrs 40
billion aid program.
	   The austerity measures and the expected IMF-rescue package
``have created the right momentum for the government to start
reducing interest rates,'' said economist Flavio Castelo Branco of
the National Confederation of Industries.
	   Brazil's key lending rate was nearly doubled to 49.75 percent in
September as investors fled the country following Russia's default
and devaluation in August. The country's foreign reserves have
fallen to around dlrs 45 billion from the dlrs 70 billion posted at
the end of July.
	   ``With interest rates like these, it's impossible to draw up any
coherent investment or expansion plan,'' said Aldo Lorenzetti,
president of a large electrical appliance factory.
	   Abram Szajman, president of the Sao Paulo Chamber of Commerce,
described current interest rates as ``incomprehensible'' and called
on the government to reduce them to pre-crisis levels of less than
25 percent.
	   High interest rates, he said, have caused a ``brutal drop'' in
retail sales, especially in the auto and household appliance
sectors.
	   For Alfredo Rizkallah, president of the Sao Paulo Stock
Exchange, the government would send an ``extremely positive sign''
if it begins lowering interest rates.
	   ``Capital flight, the main justification for high interest
rates, is no longer a major concern,'' said Rizkallah. ``The
exchange market has stabilized.''
	   So far this month, the exchange market shows a net inflow dlrs
113 million, following a total net outflow of dlrs 21 billion in
September and October.
	   On Wednesday, businessmen will turn their attention to the
Central Bank's Monetary Policy Committee that will set interest
rates for the next five weeks.
	   Horacio Lafer Piva, president of the Federation of Industries of
the State of Sao Paulo, said he hoped interest rates would be
lowered to 23 percent. Rizkallah said 33 to 36 percent would be a
good start.

	   ASHKELON, Israel (AP) _ In this ethnically divided town stained
by the recent killing of an immigrant soldier, the Moroccan-born
mayor cut a deal with the Russian party to survive Tuesday's local
elections.
	   In Jerusalem, a rabbi enticed the faithful to vote for his
religious party by promising an eternity in heaven. An Arab running
for city council received death threats and in the northern
community of Beit Shean, a centenarian sage prayed above the town
from a helicopter to win last-minute support for the candidate of
his choice.
	   Israel's nationwide elections Tuesday for mayor and city
councils were marred by violence and campaign stunts. With dozens
of tiny special interest parties running, the elections reflected
the increasing fragmentation of Israel's society along ethnic and
religious lines and were a sign of the decaying power once held by
the country's two main national parties.
	   In the ancient Mediterranean city of Ashkelon settled by the
Romans more than 20 centuries ago, the ethnic tensions surrounding
election day were highlighted by the murder Friday of a soldier
from the former Soviet Union who was stabbed to death, allegedly
for speaking in his mother-tongue. Four Israelis of Morrocan
descent were under arrest for the murder.
	   Some 30,000 Russian-speaking immigrants now live in this sleepy
seaside port and they were expected to overwhelmingly support the
immigrant rights party, Israel B'Aliya, which is running mostly
Russian-speaking candidates in local elections for the first time.
	   Hoping to restore the uneasy peace between the sides and keep
his seat in power, Benny Vaknin, the incumbent mayoral candidate
promised to appoint a Russian speaker as his deputy if the party
dropped plans to run a candidate against him. With 30 percent of
the population behind them, Israel B'Aliya agreed.
	   In Jerusalem, an Arab insurance broker defied an election
boycott called by Yasser Arafat's Palestinian Authority to protest
Israeli rule in the contested city.
	   Moussa Aliyan, the first Arab candidate for city council, said
he wanted to show the city's 180,000 Palestinian residents that the
only way to get more classrooms, new roads and a sewage system was
to participate in local politics.
	   ``They are not getting what they are entitled to because of the
boycott,'' Aliyan said. A newcomer to politics, Aliyan said he has
received death threats in recent weeks, but was not deterred.
	   Israeli police arrested two Authority activists for threatening
Palestinian voters. Six others were detained for trying to shut
down shops not participating in a partial commercial strike called
to protest the election.
	   For the city's Jewish voters, a growing culture clash between
religious and secular Jews over the role of religion in daily life,
pitted the two groups against one another at the polls.
	   The Shas party, which draws much of their support from Moroccan
Jews, appealed to a wider audience with promises of blessings from
aged rabbis. Weeks before the vote, they handed out amulets, lucky
charms and posters of their party's spiritual leader.
	   But aside from the last-minute campaign tactics, it was low
voter turn out and a high number of violent incidents at polling
stations which grabbed headlines in Israel.
	   Police spokeswoman Linda Menuhin said officers responded to 278
violent incidents throughout the country.
	   In Tel Aviv, a switchboard serving the offices of front-running
mayoral candidate Ron Huldai was set on fire, a firebomb was thrown
at the house of another candidate, and the car of a volunteer was
torched.
	   There were several incidents of election fraud. In Jerusalem,
police arrested two minors who tried to cast ballots using false
registration papers. As the campaign drew to a close, there were
incidents of arson and fistfights among rival party workers.
	   In all, 682 candidates competed for 58 mayor spots, and more
than 20,000 hopefuls ran for 2,800 seats on local councils. Polls
were to close at 10:00pm (20:00gmt) and preliminary results were
not expected before midnight. Official results were to be posted
sometime Wednesday.

Scientists get mouse to grow elephant egg
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By RICK CALLAHAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   INDIANAPOLIS (AP) _ Scientists have coaxed a mouse into growing
an elephant egg in a technique that could someday be used to help
save some of the world's endangered species.
	   Mice could be used as factories to produce eggs of other
species; the eggs could then be fertilized and used to impregnate
the endangered animals.
	   Purdue University researcher John Critser led a team that
transplanted ovarian tissue from African elephants into lab mice
that had been bred so that their bodies wouldn't reject foreign
tissue.
	   Several of the mice developed egg-producing follicles and one
contained a mature _ though misshapen _ egg. Critser's team did not
use it to try to impregnate an elephant, figuring the egg was not
healthy enough to produce a successful pregnancy.
	   The elephant egg posed no size problem for the mice because the
eggs of both species are microscopic.
	   ``It's a very important step, but it's clearly going to be a
long time before anyone is going to make an elephant out of this,''
said Randall Prather, a professor of animal science at the
University of Missouri at Columbia.
	   Scientists previously managed to grow egg follicles in lab mice
using ovarian tissue from sheep and a few other species, but they
didn't look to see whether the mice had produced eggs, Critser
said.
	   Critser said he believes this is the first time tissue from an
endangered species has produced an egg in the mice.
	   Critser said he took the ovarian tissue from the carcasses of
three freshly killed elephants he came upon during a visit to South
Africa. The tissue was frozen, then thawed a year later and
transplanted into the mice, which are commonly used in biomedical
research.
	   The findings were reported in the October issue of the journal
Animal Reproduction Science.
	   The experiment shows that rather than stocking animal tissue
banks with hard-to-obtain eggs and embryos, it would be far easier
to collect ovary tissue and use it to grow eggs in other species,
Critser said.
	   Critser said the technique could also help cancer patients who
want to get pregnant someday but are about to undergo
fertility-destroying radiation and chemotherapy. Doctors could
remove their ovary tissue, freeze it and then return it to their
bodies if they beat the disease.
	   He is now working to fine-tune the freezing, thawing and
transplant process to ensure that the mice produce a steady supply
of healthy eggs.
	   The experiment shows that such material can remain on ice for a
long time and still be usable, said Dr. Betsy Dresser, senior vice
president of the Audubon Institute in New Orleans, which maintains
a bank of about 500 samples of sperm, eggs and embryos from
endangered species such as gorillas, rhinos and antelopes.

Queen Elizabeth II arrives for WWI commemoration
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Queen Elizabeth II arrived in France Tuesday
evening for a brief trip to commemorate the 80th anniversary of the
end of World War I and to inaugurate a statue of Sir Winston
Churchill.
	   The queen arrived at the Villacoublay military airport and went
to the British ambassador's residence, where she was to have dinner
with Churchill's daughter, Lady Soames.
	   On Wednesday morning, she was to be joined by President Jacques
Chirac for a grand ceremony at the Arc de Triomphe at the top of
the Champs-Elysees, where they were to lay a wreath at the Tomb of
the Unknown Soldier.
	   The two leaders also were to lay a wreath at a statue of Georges
Clemenceau, France's revered World War I leader.
	   After a lunch with Chirac, the queen was to unveil a statue of
Churchill _ on the Avenue Winston Churchill.
	   The sculpture, by French sculptor Jean Cardot, was molded after
a photograph of Churchill walking down the Champs-Elysees at the
end of World War II in 1944.
	   Later in the day, the queen was to travel to Ypres in Belgium,
where she was to join Belgian King Albert II in honoring troops
slain there in the Great War.

Mir cosmonauts prepare for spacewalk to install meteor device
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with spacewalk started, quote from mission

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Two Russian cosmonauts on the Mir space station
took a spacewalk Tuesday to mount a French-made device for catching
and studying small meteorite particles.
	   Cosmonauts Gennady Padalka and Sergei Avdeyev ventured into
space at 10:24 p.m. Moscow time (1924 GMT) to install the
``meteorite trap,'' which should collect data on a barrage of
particles expected to peak around the Mir in mid-November, said
Valery Lyndin, spokesman for mission control.
	   ``It's going to be a long job, since the crew will have to move
all across the station's surface,'' Lyndin said. The cosmonauts
will move from one corner of the sprawling six-module station to
attach the meteorite trap.
	   The device will stay attached to the Mir until 1999, when it
will be taken back to earth for analysis by a French astronaut who
will fly to the station early next year.
	   The ``meteorite rain'' doesn't pose a serious threat to the Mir
because it consists of tiny remnants, not full meteorites. To be
safe, however, the two cosmonauts will board the Soyuz escape
capsule when the shower reaches its peak.
	   While on their spacewalk, Padalka and Avdeyev will also mount
other scientific hardware on the outside of the 12-year-old Mir,
and release a satellite made by schoolchildren from several
countries. The entire mission is scheduled to last six hours,
ending early Wednesday Moscow time.

<TEXT>
	   DALLAS (AP) _ The American Heart Association is recommending a
healthy diet to lower levels of a blood substance called
homocysteine that might _ or might not _ cause heart disease. But
it cautioned against routinely screening people's homocysteine
levels.
	   In a report released at its annual meeting Tuesday, the heart
association waded cautiously into the scientific debate over the
connection between homocysteine and heart disease.
	   Some researchers argue that homocysteine is an under-appreciated
cause of heart trouble that should be brought under control. Others
believe it is insignificant.
	   The AHA compromised by recommending that people eat vitamin-rich
food that lowers homocysteine levels. But it stopped short of
urging any special effort to monitor homocysteine or bring it down
with vitamin pills.
	   ``Right now, we have no scientific evidence that lowering
homocysteine is beneficial,'' said Dr. Robert H. Eckle of the
University of Colorado, chairman of the association's nutrition
committee.
	   Citrus fruits, tomatoes, vegetables, cereal and foods made from
grains are rich in folic acid and vitamins B-6 and B-12, which
lower homocysteine.
	   Homocysteine is an amino acid that results naturally from the
breakdown of protein.
	   The AHA reviewed 11 major studies that delved into the
association between homocysteine levels and heart trouble. Six
found a link; five did not.
	   Two more were presented at this week's AHA meeting. Both add to
the evidence that high homocysteine may be bad, even in those who
have no other risks of heart trouble, such as high cholesterol or
diabetes.
	   ``Homocysteine appears to be a modest risk factor limited to
those with the highest levels,'' said Dr. Paul M. Ridker of the
Veterans Administration Medical Center and Brigham and Women's
Hospital, both in Boston.
	   Ridker's new data were based on a three-year follow-up of 366
healthy women. It found that the risk of heart disease in those in
the top 10 percent of homocysteine levels was double that of women
with the lowest levels.
	   The other new results, based on the National Institute of
Health's Framingham Heart Study, found a more gradual increase in
the risk of stroke with increasing levels of homocysteine.
	   However, Dr. Ronald M. Krauss of the Lawrence Berkeley National
Laboratory, an author of the AHA statement, said there is no
evidence that checking people for homocysteine levels is worth the
expense. These tests typically cost between dlrs 50 and dlrs 100.
	   In January, the Food and Drug Administration required food
makers to add folic acid to grain products, such as bread, pasta
and cereal. The goal was to prevent birth defects. However, doctors
said Tuesday this is also bringing down people's homocysteine
levels.

Corruption investigation to be opened against Russia's deputy
</HEADLINE>
premier &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Prosecutors are opening a corruption probe against
Deputy Prime Minister Gennady Kulik, suspected of involvement in
fraud during his tenure as a top Soviet official, Russia's
prosecutor general said Tuesday.
	   The investigation comes soon after prominent liberal lawmaker
Grigory Yavlinsky accused Russia's government of widespread
corruption and suggested looking into the activities of several
influential officials _ including Kulik.
	   Kulik will be investigated in a 1990 case in which the Soviet
government offered to pay state-farm workers for their produce with
certificates that the government said could be redeemed for scarce
goods _ electronic equipment, jeans and foreign-made shoes.
	   Most workers never received the goods.
	   At the time, Kulik was first deputy prime minister in charge of
agriculture in the Russian republic, one of the 15 Soviet
republics.
	   Officials involved in the operation exported oil products to the
West, and the profits were to be spent on buying electronics and
jeans for the farm workers, Russia's RTR television station
reported Tuesday.
	   Profits from the oil were estimated at up to dlrs 30 million,
but the certificates issued to state farm workers remain nothing
but paper, RTR said.
	   ``I have ordered (prosecutors) to pull out this case, analyze
it, and answer the question of the degree of Gennady Kulik's
involvement in the affair,'' Prosecutor General Yuri Skuratov told
reporters Tuesday.
	   Kulik appeared undaunted and dismissed the prosecutor's plans
Tuesday.
	   ``If the prosecutors have grounds for going back to the case,
let them,'' Kulik said. ``Let them go back to it. Let them take a
look.''
	   ``But you should remember that the time of sensations has
passed,'' Kulik told reporters.
	   Yavlinsky provoked an uproar last month when he said the present
Russian Cabinet is just as prone to corruption as its predecessors.
He did not give specific examples of graft.

Analysts: Saddam has no option but to keep UNSCOM out
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With Iraq-UN &QL; 
 &UR; By LEON BARKHO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraq's top political scientists, who
sometimes advise the government, asserted at a seminar Tuesday that
Iraq has no option but to stick to its decision on halting work by
U.N. weapons inspections.
	   It is futile to think that allowing inspections to resume will
help Iraq achieve its goal of having U.N. trade sanctions lifted,
they said.
	   ``Regardless of whether it is right or wrong, Iraq has put
itself in a difficult position,'' Khalil al-Hadithi, professor of
international relations, told the seminar attended by 10 professors
of international relations and strategic studies and about 20
post-graduate students from Baghdad University.
	   The opinions _ while not all adhering to the government line _
still give strong support to Iraq's stated willingness to face
military strikes by the United States and Britain rather than allow
inspections to resume.
	   Suheil al-Fatlawi, who chairs the university's political science
department, said he will send a report summarizing the opinions to
the Iraqi leadership later Tuesday.
	   The professors have held similar meetings and given their
opinions during Iraq's previous crises with the United Nations over
weapons inspections.
	   The current crisis is over Iraq's Oct. 31 decision to halt all
work by the United Nations Special Commission, which is responsible
for eliminating Iraq's chemical and biological weapons and
long-range missiles.
	   Iraq's official position is that it will unchain UNSCOM only if
the U.N. Security Council gives a timetable for lifting the
sanctions imposed after Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
	   The invasion led to the 1991 Gulf War. A cease-fire was called
after Iraq agreed to comply with several resolutions calling for
Iraq to cooperate with UNSCOM.
	   But the political analysts said the resolutions are heavily
weighed against Iraq.
	   ``A careful reading of the resolutions will show they are like a
peace treaty between the victor and the vanquished. In them, the
stamp of the victor is clear,'' said al-Hadithi.
	   Even if Iraq was declared clear of all illegal weapons, there
were other resolutions that ``the victors will try to force us to
implement.''
	   ``Now they are talking about Kuwaiti prisoners and human rights.
It is a vicious circle that has a beginning but not an end,'' he
said.
	   One professor, Abdulqadir Mohammed, said he believed the
government may make some concessions if it became clear that
military strikes were imminent.
	   Asked whether Iraq would accept the strikes, Mohammed said:
``There will be a way out if or when the crisis reaches its peak.''

	   EL PORTILLO, Honduras (AP) _ Slowly, the villagers emerged from
behind the rotting, broken stalks of corn. Their faces were gaunt,
dirty _ and smiling.
	   Somehow, a U.S. Army helicopter had spotted their community
nestled between two mountains 20 miles (35 kilometers) south of
Tegucigalpa. El Portillo was too small to appear on the pilot's
map, but the earnest waves of its children were clearly too large
to ignore.
	   Aid for victims of Hurricane Mitch has poured into Honduras
since the storm hit late last month. Across Central America, the
storm killed roughly 10,000 and left hundreds of thousands
homeless. But there has been confusion about where help is needed
most and how to get it there.
	   As the residents of El Portillo learned, sometimes help comes
just by dumb luck.
	   ``There is no highway. The bridge collapsed,'' a weary Guadalupe
Barahona told Hugh Parmer, assistant administrator for humanitarian
response for the U.S. Agency for International Development.
	   Dozens of the 500 villagers of El Portillo crowded around Parmer
in the corn field, touching him, hugging him, thanking him _ before
he had even given out a grain of rice. They seemed unaware of the
insects nesting in their hair or the caked mud between their bare
toes.
	   Mitch didn't kill anyone in El Portillo, but it destroyed many
homes and the only road leading to food and medicine.

Former prime minister acquitted in Sudan bombings trial
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MOHAMED OSMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) _ A military tribunal acquitted an ousted
prime minister and 16 others in a bombing case for lack of evidence
Tuesday, Sudanese radio reported.
	   Former prime minister and opposition leader Sadiq el-Mahdi was
tried in absentia, as were 14 others acquitted in the case,
including el-Mahdi's son Abdel-Rahman and former Agriculture
Minister Omar Nur-Eldayem.
	   One person was sentenced to life imprisonment and two others
received prison sentences of two and three years, the radio said.
	   The case stemmed from two bombings in February in the city of
Wadi Madani, 95 miles (150 kilometers) southeast of the capital,
Khartoum. No one was killed in the explosions.
	   Security forces arrested five people after bombs went off at a
government building and a service station. Three of the five
suspects confessed and said they had received explosives training
in an opposition camp in neighboring Eritrea that prosecutors
claimed was run by el-Mahdi, the radio said.
	   The three who confessed received prison sentences and the two
others were acquitted.
	   The court found no further evidence against el-Mahdi, an elected
leader who was overthrown in a 1989 bloodless coup by current
President Lt. Gen. Omar el-Bashir. He fled Sudan in 1996 to
Eritrea.
	   El-Mahdi's Umma Party has joined with the Sudan People's
Liberation Army, a guerrilla group, in a larger opposition
alliance-in-exile against el-Bashir's government.
	   The SPLA has been fighting since 1983 for greater autonomy for
the southern districts, which are predominantly Christian and
animist, from the mostly Islamic Arab-led north.

Shooting erupts in northern city after arrests

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with some armed men in local government building;
explosion in Tirana; trims; adds byline.

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TIRANA, Albania (AP) _ A crowd took to the streets of a northern
city on Tuesday and fired shots in the air, the state news agency
ATA reported. They were protesting the arrest of three people
detained after they reportedly confronted the president while
armed.
	   The unrest in Shkodra, 85 kilometers (50 miles) north of Tirana,
began in the early afternoon after the arrests. The men were
detained about a week after reportedly walking toward President
Rexhep Mejdani while having arms on their person.
	   A police source originally said the men were charged with trying
to assassinate Mejdani. But the interior ministry later said the
men had been arrested on suspicion of theft. Two were later
released, but a third remained in custody late Tuesday.
	   A crowd of people who identified themselves as members of
anti-Communist unions gathered in the town's main square demanding
the release of the detained, ATA said. Later, they blocked off part
of the town and some of them started shooting in the air, said ATA,
without giving crowd figures.
	   By late Tuesday, some armed men had gained entry into the main
local government building, state television said. Ali Lacaj, the
prefect _ or Shkodra representative of the federal government _
said told reporters in phone interviews that he was with the men
but denied he was being held hostage.
	   The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe reported
its office in Shkodra had been looted of computers and other
equipment. Nobody had been hurt, said the organization.
	   The latest unrest is expected to sharpen the dispute between the
two biggest political parties in the country. Shkodra is a
stronghold of former President Sali Berisha, who was voted out of
office after months of turmoil last year and who figured in more
recent unrest in September, as he demanded the resignation of the
Socialists.
	   Fearing a new escalation of violence in Europe's poorest
country, international organizations are closely monitoring the
situation.
	   Their efforts to persuade the opposition to participate in a
Nov. 22 referendum that would enact the first post-Communist
constitution have failed, as the opposition has declared it will
boycott the plebiscite.
	   Austrian Ambassador Arno Riedel told reporters on Tuesday that
he was concerned about the ``disturbing reports'' coming from
Shkodra. In the name of the European Union _ Austria now holds the
EU's rotating presidency _ he called on Albanians to remain calm.
	   ``If you only work with Kalashnikovs and do not cooperate with
each other, how can you reach European standards in this country?''
he told reporters.
	   In Tirana late Tuesday, an explosion in front of a cafe owned by
a Kosovo Albanian damaged a nearby car and shattered windows close
by. There were no injuries in the explosion, which was unrelated to
the Shkodra tensions.

Heirs of French banker sue over possible Van Gogh fake
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MARILYN AUGUST &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Heirs of a French banker who paid 55 million francs
(dlrs l0 million) for a Van Gogh landscape are suing the previous
owners and auctioneers who sold it, saying they knowingly withheld
information suggesting it may be a fake.
	   According to reports Tuesday in the daily Figaro and LCI
television, the family of Jean-Marc Vernes has launched legal
action against French auctioneers Jean-Claude Binoche and Antoine
Godeau, who sold them the landscape, ``Jardin a Auvers'' (Garden at
Auvers).
	   The family contends the 1992 sale catalog neglected to mention
that the painting was once owned by Amedee Schuffenecker, brother
of Claude-Emile Schuffenecker _ a second-rate artist notorious for
copying successful artists, including Van Gogh.
	   Since the Vernes sale, experts have been agonizing over whether
``Jardin'' is a brilliantly executed fake.
	   The work isn't a typical Van Gogh. The colors are right _ iris
blues, spring greens and golden yellows. But the abstract
perspective and brush strokes lack the artist's usual realistic
touches, like a fence, a rooftop or a church spire.
	   Some experts also have pointed out the presence of curved lines
and the pointillist style _ masses of tiny dots of color to create
a visual effect _ absent from other works of the period.
	   The world's leading Van Gogh scholars have repeatedly insisted
that Van Gogh executed the small landscape in the creative frenzy
leading up to his suicide in 1890.
	   But many now say he couldn't possibly have painted the 70
landscapes attributed to him in that short time frame.
	   The painting has been making headlines in France since the
1980s, when then-owner Jacques Walter tried to take it to
Switzerland.
	   In 1989 France classified the painting as a national treasure,
meaning it can't leave France without an exit visa _ almost always
denied.
	   The measure, designed to protect France's artistic patrimony,
greatly lowers a work's market value.
	   When Walter's heir, Jean-Jacques, sold the painting in 1992, it
was valued at dlrs 40 million but fetched just dlrs 11 million.
	   Walter sued the state and won. In 1995 the French government
paid him 145 million francs (dlrs 26 million), a reimbursement for
what he would have gotten on the open market.
	   If the court rules in favor of Vernes' heirs, Walter would have
to pay them and the French government back.
	   The case could take years to resolve.

	   LONDON (AP) _ Gerald Long, who led Britain's Reuters news agency
from 1963 to 1981 and later became managing director of The Times
of London, has died at 75, Reuters said Tuesday.
	   Media relations director Peter Thomas said Long died Sunday at
home in Paris, where had had lived in retirement for some years. No
cause of death was given.
	   Vowing to be Reuters' ``second founder,'' Long turned the agency
from a news operation that battled to break even into a flourishing
company that was successfully floated on the London Stock Exchange
after his departure in 1981.
	   To do this, he introduced new commercial services _ including
business information and financial monitoring _ and persuaded the
board that in order to remain dynamic, the company must borrow
money.
	   ``Reuters' central purpose is to achieve the highest standards
of excellence in the provision of news services, and information
and communications systems ... and to maintain this purpose,
Reuters must be profitable,'' he once told the board.
	   Born in York, northern England, he studied modern languages at
Cambridge before joining the army in 1943. He was commissioned into
the Intelligence Corps and at the end of World War II was a major
stationed in Germany, where he helped set up several newspapers.
	   In 1948, he joined Reuters as a trainee and worked as a
correspondent in Frankfurt, Germany, Paris, and in Ankara, Turkey.
	   By 1956, he was chief correspondent in Germany and three years
later was given responsibility for East and West Germany, Austria
and the Russian republics.
	   In 1960, he returned to London as assistant general manager, and
was made chief executive in 1963.
	   He immediately set about modernizing the company and in 1964
signed a contract with Ultronics Corp. of New Jersey to provide
financial news to businesses, with Reuters providing the
information and Ultronics the equipment, called Stockmasters.
	   The system was soon making healthy profits, but even they were
outstripped by the profits that flowed in from Reuters' new
financial monitoring services.
	   In 1967, Reuters broke its traditionally close working
relationship with The Associated Press _ which provided most of
Reuters' news copy from the United States _ after Long decreed that
it must develop its own independent reporting operation.
	   In 1981, Long accepted an offer to become managing director of
The Times, but in doing so he missed Reuters' flotation and the
chance to become a millionaire.
	   He did not settle, not having worked on a newspaper before. A
man of great charm and humor who had many friends, he also ``had
immovable opinions and was often bad-tempered,'' The Times said in
its obituary.
	   After an acrimonious correspondence with chef Albert Roux about
the standard of cheese provided at his London restaurant Le
Gavroche _ which The Times published _ Long was replaced as
managing director, but remained as vice-chairman until 1984, when
he retired to France.
	   He is survived by his wife Anne, three daughters and two sons. A
funeral was scheduled to take place in Paris on Wednesday.

IAEA sees no Iraqi pullout for its nuclear inspectors
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ The International Atomic Energy Agency
has no plans to suspend nuclear monitoring work in Iraq in
solidarity with United Nations special weapons inspectors, a U.N.
spokesman said Tuesday.
	   David Kyd, spokesman for the Vienna-based IAEA, ruled out such
an action, as was done earlier this year, without orders to that
effect from the U.N. Security Council.
	   Iraq's Oct. 31 decision to halt inspections is aimed at the
U.S.-dominated U.N. Special Commission, whose dozens of inspectors
are charged with eliminating Iraq's biological and chemical weapons
as well as long-range missiles.
	   The Iraqi ban exempts monitors from the IAEA, whose nine
inspectors in Iraq have been carrying out ``business as usual,''
Kyd said.
	   ``If the Iraqis were so careful to differentiate'' between the
two groups, the spokesman said, ``why should we hitch our wagons to
the UNSCOM team?''
	   Some of the agency's U.N. sponsors expressed reservations
following the IAEA's unilateral action last time, he added.
	   Kyd acknowledged that the scope of the inspections remains
severely limited by restrictions imposed by Baghdad in August.
	   ``For the time being, our work is unhampered as long as we keep
to the declared sites, accompanied by our Iraqi counterparts ...
our minders,'' he said.

 &UR; Ravanelli describes talk of return to Juventus as ``rubbish''
 &UR; Eds: Updates with denial from Ravenelli, Marseille &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MARSEILLE, France (AP) _ Fabrizio Ravanelli on Tuesday denied
speculation that he is about to return to Italian powerhouse
Juventus.
	   Press reports in Italy and France had linked the 29-year-old
Italian international with a move to Juventus after the longterm
injury to the Italian club's star striker Alessandro Del Piero.
	   But the player and Marseille said that there is no chance of a
transfer.
	   ``I have a contract with Marseille and I am fine. There is no
question of me leaving,'' Ravanelli, who was sold by Juventus in
1996, told the Associated Press. ``This is rubbish.''
	   Marseille director general Jean-Michel Roussier was also quick
to scotch talk of a transfer.
	   ``It is unfounded and a fantasy. We have had no contact with the
Italian club,'' he told journalists before traveling to Marseille's
match at Nancy on Tuesday, where Ravanelli captained the team.
	   ``Fabrizio Ravanelli is fine at Marseille.''

Zimbabwe reaches final with 24-run victory over Sri Lanka
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: UPDATES with match details; CHANGES overline &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   SHARJAH, United Arab Emirates (AP) _ Leg spinner Paul Strang
claimed four wickets for 32 runs and Zimbabwe cruised to a 24-run
victory Tuesday over Sri Lanka to reach the final of the Coca Cola
Trophy.
	   Tuesday's victory pits Zimbabwe against India in Friday's
championship match of the three-nation, dlrs 85,000 tournament and
sends the World Cup champions home winless in four matches.
	   Strang, who won the man of the match for his excellent bowling
performance, shattered the Sri Lankan middle order by taking his
totals in 10 overs.
	   Sri Lanka, chasing Zimbabwe's 259 for seven in 50 overs, was
bowled out for 235 in 48.5 overs.
	   Strang, who plays in the English county championships, began
with two wickets in his first over, having Marvan Atapattu caught
by Alistair Campbell, and then dismissed Captain Arjuna Ranatunga
for duck on his fifth delivery.
	   Strang continued by removing dangerman Aravinda de Silva for 26,
and a surprized Roshan Mahanama (16), to have Sri Lanka reeling at
103 for six.
	   De Silva had to use a runner after pulling a hamstring muscle
while diving to reach the crease.
	   Left-handed Hashan Tillekeratne, playing his first match at
Sharjah Stadium, tried to rally Sri Lanka with his unbeaten 72-run
stand.
	   Tillekeratne was given good backing by all-rounder Kumara
Dharmasena (39 off 52), combining for a 93-run partnership took
that Sri Lanka to 196.
	   However, Dharmasena attempting a big hit was bowled by Andrew
Whittal dropping Sri Lanka 196 for seven in 44.1 overs.
	   The Sri Lankans battled with Chaminda Vaas smacking 19 off as
many balls, including a six and couple of boundaries.
	   Earlier, Neil Johnson and Andy Flower both hit half centuries
and combined for a 149-run, fourth-wicket partnership that rescued
Zimbabwe from 24 for three.
	   Flower made 95 off 109 balls and Johnson 72 off 106 to lift the
Africans to the highest score so far in the three-nation
competition.
	   Flower and Johnson's fourth-wicket stand broke Zimbabwe's own
previous partnership record.
	   Left-handed Flower stroked six boundaries and a six but was
stumped by keeper Romesh Kaluwitharna when he leapt out to smack
spinner Sanath Jayasuriya.
	   Johnson was run out by a direct throw from Thilan Samaraweera
after hitting two fours and a six. He, like Flower, used the
reverse sweep effectively against the bowling to pick up runs.
	   Eddo Brandes clubbed 28 from 22 balls to further help Zimbabwe's
innings.
	   Paceman Pramodaya Wickremasinghe bowled impressively for the Sri
Lankans, finishing with three for 28 from 10 overs, while
Jayasuriya was the most expensive, giving away 59 runs including
seven wides for his solitary wicket of Flower.
	   India will play against Zimbabwe on Wednesday before the final
of Firday when the two teams face each other again.

Spain's government rules out discussing Basque independence with
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; RETRANSMITTING &QL; 
ETA &QL; 
 &UR; By DANIEL WOOLLS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ The Spanish government has ruled out any
discussion of Basque independence in expected peace talks with the
armed separatist group ETA, a government spokesman said Tuesday.
	   Spokesman Josep Pique said the government would only negotiate
terms for ETA to surrender its weapons and the fate of more than
500 ETA prisoners in jails around Spain.
	   ``In the peace process, this is all there is to talk about,''
Pique told reporters in the northeastern city of Barcelona.
	   ``No one should think there is going to be any kind of political
negotiation on the basis of what might arise when the violence
ends,'' he added.
	   Pique was speaking a day after a senior official from the
opposition Socialist party warned that ETA, which began observing
an open-ended ceasefire on Sept. 18, was attempting to force
full-blown talks on the future of the Basque country as its price
for renouncing violence for good.
	   Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar, flush with a strong showing by
his center-right Popular Party in Basque regional elections on Oct.
25, said last Tuesday his government is willing to hold preliminary
talks with ETA.
	   The purpose of these discussions, the government said, would be
for ETA to confirm that it really wants peace.
	   Two days later ETA issued a statement that fell short of
promising a permanent end to violence. The document was dated
before Aznar's offer.
	   In it ETA supported a Basque nationalist peace proposal that
calls for a two-track process made up of negotiations between the
government and ETA, on issues like weapons and prisoners, and
separate all-party talks on the future of the Basque country.
	   These latter discussions would touch on ETA's stated goal of
independence, according to this blueprint signed by a broad range
of nationalist Basque parties and known as the Lizarra Declaration
after a town in Spain's northern Basque region.
	   Pique's remarks ruling out talks on independence come as both
sides jockey to shape a peace-talks agenda that suits them best,
with the government seeking to keep it as narrow as possible, while
ETA is trying to push it open.
	   ETA, which stands for Basque Homeland and Freedom, has killed
nearly 800 people in its 30-year campaign for an independent Basque
nation carved out of parts of northern Spain and southern France.

Italy takes step toward ending 3-decade electricity monopoly
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Italy's Cabinet acted Tuesday to end the
state-controlled electric utility's three-decade monopoly,
decreeing that 30 percent of Italy's electricity market will be
opened to competition in coming months.
	   The 30-percent privatization will take place by mid-February; by
2003, no operator can own more than half of the nation's
electricity capacity.
	   The timing is keyed to European Union privatization deadlines.
	   ``We leave the legal monopoly with a renovated system; a true
liberalization that will make increased competition, leaving room
for new actors without destroying what exists,'' Industry Ministry
Pierluigi Bersani declared.
	   Italy created ENEL SpA in a 1962 law that gave it Italy's
electricity market.
	   Today, ENEL accounts for 80 percent of electricity production,
100 percent of transmission and 93 percent of distribution.
	   Italy now is going farther than EU mandates that require a 33
percent opening in the market by 2003, Bersani said.
	   In taking office as premier last month, former communist Massimo
D'Alema pledged that his leftist government would uphold the
stringent economic policies that got Italy into the 1999 debut of
Europe's common currency. Parliament earlier passed a law approving
the opening of the electricity market.
	   The government also plans to create a public company to take
over and decommission ENEL's four nuclear plants. The plants have
been idle since Italians voted down nuclear power in 1987.

<TEXT>
	   LUANDA, Angola (AP) _ Troops and police Tuesday combed the
jungle of northeast Angola for 24 workers, including four
foreigners, abducted by gunmen during a raid on a remote
Canadian-owned diamond mine in which 24 employees were killed and
45 wounded, officials said.
	   The abducted workers included British geologist Jason Pope,
South African metallurgist Douglas Larsen, and two Filipinos, as
well as 20 Angolan staff, according to Gaspar Cardoso, a Luanda
representative for Vancouver-based DiamondWorks Ltd..
	   Gunmen attacked the mine at Yetwene, a mining village about 600
kilometers (370 miles) east of the capital Luanda, before dawn
Sunday.
	   A gun battle between the assailants and company security guards
left 24 employees dead, including three foreigners, and 45 others
wounded, 10 seriously, Cardoso said in an interview.
	   In a written press statement issued in London, DiamondWorks
confirmed only that eight people were killed, 16 were wounded and
five abducted.
	   A spokesman for the Angolan armed forces said the army was
pursuing the attackers but had little hope of catching them.
	   ``It's going to be very difficult...It's thick jungle up there,
and normally these groups cross quickly over the border (with
Congo),'' said the spokesman who identified himself only as Brig.
Jota.
	   Diplomats in Luanda identified the dead as Britons Alan Thomas,
49, and David Boutle, 26, and Portuguese-born South African Antonio
Vasconcelos.
	   The identities of the other dead, all Angolans, were not
immediately available.
	   DiamondWorks' chief executive officer Bruce Walsham was due to
arrive in the Angolan capital at 9.10 p.m. (2010 GMT) Tuesday for a
three-day visit, according to Cardoso.
	   He said Walsham would hold talks with officials on securing the
release of the abducted men and would visit the Yetwene mine.
	   No ransom demand has been received, Cardoso said.
	   Jose Dias, a director of the Angolan state diamond company
Endiama which has a stake in the mine, blamed the former rebel
movement UNITA for the attack, saying some 150 gunmen took part in
the raid.
	   However, DiamondWorks quoted eyewitnesses as saying some of the
gunmen wore UNITA uniforms while others wore clothing identified
with local military and police units.
	   The region has been the scene of renewed clashes in recent
months between government forces and the remnants of the former
rebel group UNITA's guerrilla army.
	   South African diamond giant De Beers, which is prospecting for
diamonds in the region, said it had stepped up security.
	   ``It's a very, very difficult situation in terms of security.
The situation in that region is clearly deteriorating,'' De Beers
spokesman Andy Lemont said by phone from London.
	   A United Nations-brokered peace pact signed four years ago ended
two decades of civil war, but lingering hostility between the
former foes has prevented its full implementation.
	   Gangs of armed bandits, made up mostly of demobilized soldiers,
also roam the countryside of the vast southwest African nation and
have pillaged outlying towns.

	   DALLAS (AP) _ The American Heart Association is recommending a
healthy diet to lower levels of a blood substance called
homocysteine that might _ or might not _ cause heart disease. But
it cautioned against routinely screening people's homocysteine
levels.
	   In a report released at its annual meeting Tuesday, the heart
association waded cautiously into the scientific debate over the
connection between homocysteine and heart disease.
	   Some researchers argue that homocysteine is an under-appreciated
cause of heart trouble that should be brought under control. Others
believe it is insignificant.
	   The AHA compromised by recommending that people eat vitamin-rich
food that lowers homocysteine levels. But it stopped short of
urging any special effort to monitor homocysteine or bring it down
with vitamin pills.
	   ``Right now, we have no scientific evidence that lowering
homocysteine is beneficial,'' said Dr. Robert H. Eckel of the
University of Colorado, chairman of the association's nutrition
committee.

	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ Australian qualifier Wayne Arthurs
Tuesday upset second-seed Karol Kucera of Slovakia to set up a
second-round clash against American Todd Martin in the dlrs 825,000
Stockholm Open tennis tournament.
	   Arthurs, a 27-year-old doubles specialist from Adelaide, beat
the highly (7th) ranked Slovak 7-6 (7-5), 7-6 (7-4). The
Australian, who started the year at 282:nd in the ATP ranking and
improved to 168 before this tournament, is bound improve his
standing.
	   After trading service games midway through the first set, both
players held service to 6-6. Arthurs jumped to a 4-1-lead in the
tiebreak winning 7-5 on his first match point.
	   Arthurs seemed to lose control of the match early in the second
set dropping his service for a 2-0-lead for Kucera. But he
recovered and finally won the second tibreaker 7-4 for his sixth
singles win on the ATP tour and the biggest in his career.
	   ``My plan was to serve well, attack on Kuceras second serve and
win at the net,'' the Aussie lefthander said.
	   ``I had nothing to lose. If I lost nobody would cared, if I won
everybody would be very surprised,'' he added.
	   Earlier Tuesday Todd Martin powered his way into the second
round by whipping Swiss qualifier Ivo Heuburger 6-1, 6-2.
	   Martin, who has played impressively the last few weeks,
expressed satisfaction with his game recently and hoped to go far
in the tournament.
	   ``I will not predict how far, but this is a good surface for me.
If I can repeat the level of play I have achieved in the last few
weeks, I will certainly move up in the ATP ranking next year,''
said Martin, currently 22nd.
	   Martin reached the final in the 1996 Stockholm Open but lost to
Thomas Enqvist, a former two-fold winner of the tournament who was
upset Monday by lowly-ranked Japanese Takao Suzuki.
	   In other action Tuesday French veteran Cedric Pioline defeated
wild-card entry Andreas Vinciguerra of Sweden 6-3, 7-5, Daniel
Nestor of Canada beat Johan van Herck, Belgium 6-3, 7-6 (7-2). In
the evening session seventh-seed Thomas Johansson of Sweden
overcame Fabrice Santore of France 6-4, 7-6 (10-8) and Vince Spadea
of the U.S., defeated Leander Paes of India, 7-6 (7-5), 6-1.
	   Seven of the world's top 20 players entered in the tennis
tournament, one of the oldest indoors on the ATP circuit, that
began Monday.
	   Later Tuesday top seed Pete Sampras told a news conference that
he came to Stockholm Open to continue his quest to finish 1998
ranked No. 1 for a record sixth straight year.
	   ``I am here to win. I had two missions before this season -- to
equal Roy Emerson*s record of 12 Grand Slam titles and be ranked
number one for a sixth unprecedented year,'' he said.
	   He failed to accomplish the first goal but still has the chance
to top Jimmy Connors five-year streak.
	   ``That will be decided in the ATP-finals in Hanover. But If win
in Stockholm I*ll have an excellent chance to achieve my goal,''
Sampras added.
	   His scheduled opponent Wednesday is Australian Jason Stoltenberg
who has lost to Sampras the four times they've met. .

	   HAZERIM, Israel (AP) _ Six soldiers in full combat gear with
M-16 submachine guns slung on their shoulders, huddled up at an
Israeli army base Tuesday, and after a loud rallying cry, went to
work on a mock battlefield dismantling a mobile radar system.
	   From far away, it looked like a regular training exercise but a
closer look revealed a major difference. The six soldiers were all
women and after completing a seven-week military course, became
Israel's first front-line female combat soldiers.
	   After a week of additional preparation, they will be deployed
along the Lebanon border, where Israeli troops are engaged in a
full time war with Iranian-backed Hezbollah guerillas there which
target troops with roadside bombs and launch frequent rocket
attacks on northern Israeli towns.
	   While nearly all Israelis _ both men and women _ are drafted
into the military following high school graduation, the division of
labor and time served is not equal. Men serve for three years while
women serve for 20 months and until now, women were barred from
combat duty.
	   Brig. Gen. Orit Adato, the highest-ranking woman in the Israeli
army, said the new radar unit is part of a larger effort to
gradually narrow the army's gender gap.
	   Women will soon become combat aircraft navigators and naval
officers, Adato said. Already, some basic training courses are
co-ed and women commanders will be able to lead male combat
training units.
	   The mobile radar system the women learned to operate is used to
detect low-flying enemy aircraft on the front line of battle.
	   In Tuesday's simulation at an air force base in southern Israel,
the soldiers raced between a 10-wheel truck holding the radar and a
generator positioned several yards behind it. They disconnected the
two, silencing the generator's loud hum and the radar's clockwise
spin, and readied them to be driven to another position.
	   The soldiers selected for the unit share a strong view that the
responsibility of protecting the state should be shouldered by both
genders.
	   ``All the girls in this course wanted to become combat soldiers
from the beginning,'' said Orit Mazor, an 18 year-old from a Tel
Aviv suburb. ``We want to defend the country as well as boys do.''
	   Women's groups have been fighting for years for equal
opportunities for women soldiers.
	   In a landmark ruling in 1995, the Supreme Court overturned an
army policy that barred women in combat. Women were admitted to a
pilots' course in the Israeli air force last year for the first
time.

US congressional commission visits Belarus

<TEXT>
	   MINSK, Belarus (AP) _ A delegation of U.S. officials is looking
into human rights issues and democracy-building efforts in the
former Soviet republic of Belarus this week.
	   The visitors, with the U.S. Congress' committee on security and
cooperation in Europe, are meeting with Belarusian officials at
various levels and with members of non-governmental groups, the
U.S. Embassy in Minsk said Tuesday.
	   A primary concern is whether Belarus, under authoritarian
President Alexander Lukashenko, is adhering to standards of the
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which monitors
human rights, media freedom, judicial reform and other
democratization efforts.
	   The 54-nation OSCE opened a monitoring office in Belarus this
summer.
	   The U.S. Embassy would not say who the delegation was meeting
with or when, or release results of the meetings.
	   Since his election in 1994 to lead this impoverished nation of
10 million, Lukashenko has persecuted independent media, banned
rallies by his political opponents, and his police have routinely
beaten and arrested demonstrators. He insists such severity is
necessary to bring about Soviet-style stability to Belarus.

Search continues for abducted workers after Angolan mine attack

	   LUANDA, Angola (AP) _ Troops and police combed the jungle of
northeast Angola on Tuesday looking for 24 workers, including four
foreigners, abducted by gunmen during a raid on a remote
Canadian-owned diamond mine in which another 24 employees were
killed, officials said.
	   Gunmen attacked the mine at Yetwene, a mining village about 600
kilometers (370 miles) east of the capital Luanda, before dawn
Sunday.
	   A gunbattle between the assailants and company security guards
left 24 employees dead, three of them foreigners, and 45 others
wounded, said Gaspar Cardoso, a Luanda representative for
Vancouver-based DiamondWorks Ltd.
	   In addition, 24 people were abducted, including British
geologist Jason Pope, South African metallurgist Douglas Larsen,
two Filipinos, as well as 20 Angolan staff, Cardoso said in an
interview.
	   No ransom demand has been received, Cardoso said.
	   DiamondWorks' chief executive officer Bruce Walsham was arriving
in the Angolan capital Tuesday to visit the mine and hold talks
with officials on securing the release of the abducted men, Cardoso
said.
	   In a written press statement issued in London, DiamondWorks
confirmed only that eight people were killed, 16 were wounded and
five abducted.
	   A spokesman for the Angolan armed forces said the army was
pursuing the attackers but had little hope of catching them.
	   ``It's going to be very difficult ... It's thick jungle up
there, and normally these groups cross quickly over the border
(with Congo),'' said the spokesman who identified himself only as
Brig. Jota.
	   Jose Dias, a director of the Angolan state diamond company
Endiama which has a stake in the mine, blamed the former rebel
movement UNITA for the attack, saying some 150 gunmen took part in
the raid.
	   However, DiamondWorks quoted eyewitnesses as saying some of the
gunmen wore UNITA uniforms while others wore clothing identified
with local military and police units.
	   The region has been the scene of renewed clashes in recent
months between government forces and the remnants of the former
rebel group UNITA's guerrilla army.
	   South African diamond giant De Beers, which is prospecting for
diamonds in the region, said it had stepped up security.
	   ``It's a very, very difficult situation in terms of security.
The situation in that region is clearly deteriorating,'' De Beers
spokesman Andy Lemont said by phone from London.
	   A United Nations-brokered peace pact signed four years ago ended
two decades of civil war, but lingering hostility between the
former foes has prevented its full implementation.
	   Diplomats in Luanda identified the dead as Britons Alan Thomas,
49, and David Boutle, 26, and Portuguese-born South African Antonio
Vasconcelos. The identities of the other dead, all Angolans, were
not immediately available.

Nigerian villagers commemorate activist's hanging
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: New to some points; UPDATES with Jesse Jackson discussing
Ogoni concerns with Abubakar. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LAGOS, Nigeria (AP) _ Villagers from southeastern Nigeria's
Ogoni region rallied Tuesday to commemorate the 1995 hanging of
Ogoni activist and writer Ken Saro-Wiwa.
	   The Movement for the Survival of the Ogoni People, which
Saro-Wiwa led until his execution, called the rallies which
followed a Monday night vigil in the late activist's home village
of Bana.
	   Processions were planned in the university town of Ile Ife as
well as the cities of Owerri, Port Harcourt and Lagos.
	   Saro-Wiwa and eight other Ogoni environmental and human-rights
activists were hanged on Nov. 10, 1995. They were accused of
treason and involvement in a string of killings, though activists
say the nine were executed because of their antigovernment
activities.
	   The executions sparked international anger against the former
military regime of Gen. Sani Abacha and brought calls for an
international boycott against the Anglo-Dutch oil giant Shell,
which has been accused of devastating the Ogoni environment and
turning a blind eye to human-rights abuses in Nigeria.
	   Shell has since pulled out of the Ogoni region, pledging not to
return without a broad agreement that includes the Ogonis.
	   Shell asked its nonessential staff not to come to work Tuesday
at its Lagos headquarters, fearing demonstrations planned there
could block access.
	   Also Tuesday, Jesse Jackson, the U.S. special envoy to Africa,
submitted a list of Ogoni concerns to Gen. Abdulsalami Abubakar,
Nigeria's military ruler.
	   Jackson did not detail the specific concerns after the meeting
in Abuja, the Nigerian capital, but said Abubakar promised to
discuss the issues with the Ogonis and described the general's
response as ``enormous and sensitive.''
	   Jackson had met earlier in his three-day visit with Ogoni
leaders. He told reporters that he had discussed with the Ogonis
their demands for a fair distribution of resources and also ways
they could get the government to address their concerns.
	   On Monday, meanwhile, three Nigerian human rights groups went to
court requesting that the convictions of the nine be invalidated
and the bodies be released for proper burials.
	   The Committee for the Defense of Human Rights, the Eastern
Nigerian Unity Association and the Movement for the Survival of
Eastern Nigeria and the Niger Delta made the request to the federal
high court in the southeastern city of Port Harcourt.
	   Abacha, who died in June, has been replaced by Gen. Abubakar,
who has pledged to return Nigeria to democracy next year.

Investigation: Human error, negligence caused train crash
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ An investigation into a train crash last
month that killed 47 people has blamed the driver who was
over-speeding as well as faulty and missing brakes, police said
Tuesday.
	   A 22-page investigation report by engineers and railroad experts
contradicts preliminary claims by officials that the Oct. 18 crash
was caused by passengers who had tampered with the brake linkages
between carriages.
	   Most carriages of the train had overturned as the train flew off
the rails while pulling into a siding in the station of Kafr
el-Dawar town, 30 kilometers (20 miles) southeast of the port city
of Alexandria.
	   It crashed through a barricade and into the town square, killing
47 people and injuring 104.
	   The report said the train was traveling at 98 kilometers (61
miles) per hour, far higher than the acceptable speed for a train
pulling into a station.
	   Its main brake was not working properly and emergency breaks in
the cars were missing, added the officials, speaking on customary
condition of anonymity.
	   In addition, the driver had turned off the mechanism that stops
the train automatically in case of any brake failure.
	   The report added that the driver's assistant, Hosni Mohammed
Abdullah, was sitting in the second car.
	   The driver, Michel Fahmy Ibrahim, who died in the accident, had
been fined several times in the past for causing accidents, the
report said.
	   Following the accident, the government suspended five top
railway officials, including the national head of railways and the
managers in the province where the accident occurred.
	   Officials are expected to charge some railway officials and the
assistant driver, who survived the crash, the officials said.

Tajik troops search for remaining rebel fighters

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with mourning vigils in graf 4, Russia denying it

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Government troops in Tajikistan searched northern
mountainous regions Tuesday for scattered groups of rebel fighters
who were driven off after several days of fighting in the Central
Asian nation.
	   The rebels, chased into the mountains of northern Tajikistan,
were trying to flee into neighboring Uzbekistan, the Tajik Interior
Ministry said, according to the Interfax news agency.
	   The government insisted they could not escape because the area
was surrounded, the border closed, and all roads cut off.
	   The government has said more than 200 people were killed, and
hundreds more were wounded in the latest fighting. Tajiks held
vigils around the country in a nationwide day of mourning Tuesday,
Russia's ORT television reported.
	   Life was returning to normal Tuesday in the city of Khudzhand
and other areas where fighting raged, but telephone lines have not
been restored yet, Interfax reported.
	   Meanwhile, the rebel leader, former army Col. Makhmud
Khudoberdyev, remained at large. The government said he may have
fled to Uzbekistan, but the country denied harboring him or any
other rebels.
	   In Moscow, the Foreign Ministry denied reports that rebels were
hiding out in Russia.
	   Khudoberdyev had demanded that President Emomali Rakhmonov free
all political prisoners and bring his supporters into the
government. The president refused to negotiate with the rebels.
	   The fighting follows a peace treaty last year that ended five
years of civil war between the Muslim opposition and Rakhmonov's
hard-line government.
	   The main opposition groups are now participating in the
government, but a number of warlords have refused to acknowledge
the peace accord and periodically launch attacks in the poor,
mountainous former Soviet republic.

With troops out, Colombian rebels begin flexing muscle
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LA MACHACA, Colombia (AP) _ As the government and leftist rebels
prepare for peace talks to end a 34-year civil war, the guerrillas
have begun flexing their muscle in a massive area from which
President Andres Pastrana has pulled his troops.
	   ``Nobody's going through. Orders from above,'' said Orlando, a
machine-gun-toting rebel manning a roadblock that kept a six-car
convoy of journalists from venturing deeper into guerrilla
territory on Monday.
	   ``We're exercising 24-hour control in this zone,'' said the
bespectacled, 25-year-old fighter in camouflage clothes.
	   Vehicles carrying local residents went through, but only after a
meticulous search under a scorching sun.
	   Ceding to a guerrilla security demand, Pastrana last weekend
withdrew the last of about 2,000 troops and soldiers from a
16,200-square-mile (42,000-square-kilometer) region where peace
talks are expected soon with the country's largest rebel group.
	   For at least 90 days, the guerrillas will have free reign over
an area of southern Colombia the size of Switzerland.
	   As expected, rebels from the Revolutionary Armed Forces of
Colombia, FARC by its Spanish initials, are emerging from the
woods.
	   ``I've never seen so many guerrillas around here, '' said
18-year old Sonia Cruz.
	   Cruz's family's farm is a few hundred yards (meters) before the
roadblock five miles from La Sombra _ a nearby hamlet where FARC
captains have been holding court this week, summoning local
authorities, students and businessmen for lengthy chats.
	   The agenda of the talks is expected to include longstanding
rebel demands to redistribute land to peasants to clean up
Colombia's traditionally corrupt political system.
	   ``The guerrillas have a good image militarily ... but they have
to make a consciousness-raising effort to sell their mission and
their point of view to all segments of the population, '' said
Father Leonel Narvaez, the Catholic priest in San Vicente de
Caguan.
	   Four hours along ruddy roads from La Sombra, San Vicente de
Caguan is the largest of five southern municipalities in the
pullout zone, and where government negotiators are setting up their
headquarters at an evacuated army base.
	   According to local authorities who met with the rebels in La
Sombra, FARC is angry about the presence of about 130 army cadets
who are still working at San Vicente's army base, despite the
government pullout.
	   Pastrana has insisted the cadets are unarmed, and will remain as
support staff for the presidential peace delegates.
	   Meanwhile, San Vicente residents anxiously await the rebels, who
have long ruled in the surrounding countryside, but have yet to
walk openly into town.
	   The guerrillas are expected to impose curfews and instill the
strict code of conduct _ including punishments for bar brawling,
drunkenness and prostitution _ they've been enforcing for years in
nearby villages.
	   The local parish radio station plays ``Fear of the Pullout,'' a
song meant to assuage people's concerns with upbeat strains
predicting peace.
	   ``(The rebels) haven't given any orders yet,'' said 22-year-old
Janet Guzman, who waits tables at La Pala, a local discotheque that
served beer and aguardiente _ local ``firewater'' _ until midnight
all weekend.
	   ``We'll see what happens, but we're not afraid,'' she said.

Mir cosmonauts prepare for spacewalk to install meteor device
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES in last 4 grafs with schoolchildren's model of Mir
launched, background on last spacewalk. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Two Russian cosmonauts on the Mir space station
took a spacewalk Tuesday to mount a French-made device for catching
and studying small meteorite particles.
	   Cosmonauts Gennady Padalka and Sergei Avdeyev ventured into
space at 10:24 p.m. Moscow time (1924 GMT) to install the
``meteorite trap,'' which should collect data on a barrage of
particles expected to peak around the Mir in mid-November, said
Valery Lyndin, spokesman for mission control.
	   ``It's going to be a long job, since the crew will have to move
all across the station's surface,'' Lyndin said. The cosmonauts
will move from one end of the sprawling six-module station to the
other to attach the meteorite trap.
	   The device will stay attached to the Mir until 1999, when it
will be taken back to earth for analysis by a French astronaut who
will fly to the station early next year.
	   The ``meteorite rain'' doesn't pose a serious threat to the Mir
because it consists of tiny remnants, not full meteorites. To be
safe, however, the two cosmonauts will board the Soyuz escape
capsule when the shower reaches its peak.
	   At the start of the spacewalk, Padalka and Avdeyev released a
satellite model made by schoolchildren from several countries.
	   ``Toss it gently toward the moon,'' Padalka told Avdeyev.
	   The two will also mount other scientific hardware on the outside
of the 12-year-old Mir. The entire mission is scheduled to last six
hours, ending early Wednesday Moscow time.
	   It was this crew's second spacewalk. The first was in August.

 &UR; Israel's Cabinet to reconvene to ratify peace accord
 &UR; Eds: Leads throughout with comment from State Department,
Palestinian officials, Changes byline &QL;

 &UR; By DAFNA LINZER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) _ Signaling that he was now satisfied with
Palestinian security assurances, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
announced Tuesday he would convene his Cabinet to ratify the latest
Mideast peace accord.
	   Netanyahu has delayed or called off Cabinet meetings three times
since the deal was signed in Washington last month. After
complaints that the Palestinians were not doing enough to fight
terrorism, he said Tuesday that new guarantees led him to believe
that Yasser Arafat's Palestinian Authority would take ``practical
steps'' against Islamic militants.
	   The Cabinet was scheduled to meet in Jerusalem Wednesday.
	   The United States and the Palestinians welcomed the
announcement.
	   In Washington, State Department spokesman James Rubin said ``We
are pleased. It should be possible for both sides to carry out all
the steps in the Wye agreement.''
	   U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright had urged Netanyahu
to stick to the original 12-week timetable of the accord under
which Israel is to withdraw from 13 percent of the West Bank by the
end of January, in exchange for a Palestinian anti-terror campaign.
	   If the Cabinet ratifies the agreement, Israel might still be
able to meet its first commitment on Nov. 16, an initial troop
pullback from 2 percent of the West Bank.
	   ``I hope that the agreement will be ratified tomorrow and that
they will begin to make up for lost time,'' said senior Palestinian
negotiator Saeb Erekat. Erekat said the delays by Israel have
already held up agreement over several issues which were to have
been completed by now including the opening of the Palestinian
airport and the establishment of several committees as stipulated
in the accord.
	   However, Netanyahu suggested Tuesday that he would stop the
troop withdrawal process in the middle if the Palestinians did not
meet an Israeli demand concerning the procedure for revoking
clauses of the PLO founding charter that call for Israel's
destruction.
	   The Wye agreement says the Palestine National Council and other
Palestinian organizations will meet in mid-December to ``reaffirm''
a January letter by Arafat to U.S. President Bill Clinton that
lists the PLO charter clauses considered annulled.
	   Israel insists that the agreement requires the Palestinian
council to take a formal vote, while the Palestinians say only
approval of the letter by acclamation is required.
	   ``If the Cabinet approves the Wye agreement, it will add to the
decision the following stipulation: The implementation of the rest
of the agreement will be conditional on the PNC convening and
voting to change the charter,'' Netanyahu said in a statement.
	   Erekat indicated that the Palestinians would not change their
opposition to a vote.
	   ``Netanyahu should count on the Palestinian Authority carrying
out the agreement to the letter. I hope he will refrain from the
use of threats and conditions because they undermine the much
needed partnership and cooperation that the Palestinians and the
Israelis need.''
	   Netanyahu postponed the Cabinet debate three times, saying he
needed more clarifications from the Palestinians about their
campaign against Islamic militants.
	   Last Friday, the ministers had just begun their second day of
debate on the accord when the militant Islamic Jihad group carried
out a suicide bombing in Jerusalem's market, wounding 21 Israelis.
	   In response, Netanyahu broke off the Cabinet meeting and said he
would not reconvene the ministers until the Palestinian Authority
outlined how it would prevent attacks against Israelis.

France canceling debts to Nicaragua, Honduras
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ France's finance minister confirmed on Tuesday that
France is canceling the debt of Nicaragua and Honduras, a gesture
to ease the devastation those countries have suffered from
Hurricane Mitch.
	   Dominique Strauss-Kahn made the announcement during a
question-and-answer session in parliament.
	   The confirmation came a day after Prime Minister Lionel Jospin
called for the move. It also came a day before President Jacques
Chirac leaves for the region devastated by Mitch.
	   Honduras and Nicaragua had appealed for help with their foreign
debts during a summit of Central American presidents Monday to
discuss response to Hurricane Mitch, which they say killed some
10,000 people.
	   Nicaragua's total foreign debt reaches dlrs 6 billion. Honduras
owes dlrs 4.2 billion.
	   U.S. President Bill Clinton last week requested a global relief
effort and issued orders boosting U.S. emergency aid to dlrs 70
million.

	   ASHKELON, Israel (AP) _ In this ethnically divided town stained
by the recent killing of an immigrant soldier, the Moroccan-born
mayor cut a deal with the Russian party to survive Tuesday's local
elections.
	   In Jerusalem, an Arab running for city council received death
threats, and a rabbi enticed the faithful to vote for his religious
party by promising an eternity in heaven. In the northern community
of Beit Shean, a centenarian sage prayed above the town from a
helicopter to win last-minute support for his candidate.
	   Israel's nationwide elections Tuesday for mayor and city
councils were marred by violence and full of campaign stunts. With
dozens of tiny special interest parties running, the elections
reflected the increasing fragmentation of Israel's society along
ethnic and religious lines and were a sign of the decaying power
once held by the country's two main national parties.
	   In the ancient Mediterranean city of Ashkelon, settled by the
Romans more than 20 centuries ago, the ethnic tensions surrounding
election day were highlighted by the fatal stabbing Friday of a
soldier from the former Soviet Union, allegedly for speaking in his
mother tongue.
	   Four Israelis of Morrocan descent were under arrest for the
murder.
	   The 30,000 Russian-speaking immigrants living in this sleepy
seaside port were expected to overwhelmingly support the immigrant
rights party, Israel B'Aliya, which is running mostly
Russian-speaking candidates in local elections for the first time.
	   Hoping to restore the uneasy peace between the sides and remain
in power, Mayor Benny Vaknin promised to appoint a Russian speaker
as his deputy if the party dropped plans to run a candidate against
him. With 30 percent of the population behind them, the immigrants'
party agreed.
	   In Jerusalem, an Arab insurance broker defied an election
boycott, which was called by Yasser Arafat's Palestinian Authority
to protest Israeli rule in the contested city.
	   Moussa Aliyan, the first Arab candidate for city council, said
he wanted to show the city's 180,000 Palestinian residents that the
only way to get more classrooms, new roads and a sewage system was
to participate in local politics.
	   ``They are not getting what they are entitled to because of the
boycott,'' Aliyan said. A newcomer to politics, Aliyan said he has
received death threats in recent weeks, but was not deterred.
	   Israeli police arrested two Authority activists for threatening
Palestinian voters. Six others were detained for trying to shut
down shops not participating in a partial commercial strike called
to protest the election.
	   For the city's Jewish voters, a growing culture clash between
religious and secular Jews over the role of religion in daily life
pitted the two groups against one another at the polls.
	   The Shas party, which draws much of its support from Moroccan
Jews, appealed to a wider audience with promises of blessings from
aged rabbis. Weeks before the vote, they handed out amulets, lucky
charms and posters of their party's spiritual leader.
	   But aside from the last-minute campaign tactics, low turnout and
violence at polling stations grabbed headlines in Israel.
	   Police spokeswoman Linda Menuhin said officers responded to 278
violent incidents throughout the country.
	   In Tel Aviv, a switchboard serving the offices of front-running
mayoral candidate Ron Huldai was set on fire, a firebomb was thrown
at the house of another candidate, and the car of a volunteer was
torched.
	   There were several incidents of election fraud. In Jerusalem,
police arrested two minors who tried to cast ballots using false
registration papers. As the campaign drew to a close, there were
incidents of arson and fistfights among rival party workers.
	   In all, 682 candidates competed for 58 mayor spots, and more
than 20,000 hopefuls ran for 2,800 seats on local councils. Polls
were to close at 10:00pm (20:00gmt), and preliminary results were
expected after midnight.
	   Official results were to be posted sometime Wednesday.

	   LONDON (AP) _ There's further proof that Britain's monarchy is
modernizing: Prince Charles has launched his own Internet website.
	   Spread across 354 pages, it contains biographical information
about the heir to the throne, who turns 50 on Saturday, and will be
updated regularly with news and pictures, his office announced
Tuesday.
	   The site is divided into sections covering Charles' life, his
work and an Online Forum page which highlights issues of particular
interest to Queen Elizabeth II's eldest son. His speeches and a
schedule of upcoming appearances are also included.
	   In its first day, the site attracted a stream of e-mails from
around the world, with website visitors from Australia to the
United States writing in reaction to the prince's views on topics
such as architecture and genetically modified foods.
	   E-mailers also sought his opinion on issues ranging from the
modernization of the monarchy to environmental protection and
alternative medicine.

Grieve wins AL Rookie honors
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JOSH DUBOW &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Ben Grieve easily won the American League Rookie
of the Year award on Tuesday, highlighting a season in which his
sweet left-handed swing made an immediate impact.
	   The 22-year-old right fielder for the Oakland Athletics was the
only candidate named on all 28 ballots. He received 23 first-place
votes and five seconds to finish with 130 points in balloting by
the Baseball Writers' Association of America.
	   ``It means a lot after a long season to get recognition like
this,'' Grieve said. ``But at the same time it doesn't change
anything. It's just an award. I can't get too much of a big head
next year.''
	   Tampa Bay pitcher Rolando Arrojo earned four first-place votes
and 61 points. Chicago shortstop Mike Caruso was third with 34
points, followed by New York's Orlando ``El Duque'' Hernandez who
finished with 25 points and the other first-place vote.
	   Grieve, whose father Tom played in the major leagues and was the
former general manager of the Texas Rangers, led AL rookies with
168 hits, 18 home runs, 94 runs, 41 doubles and 89 RBIs. He led the
club in on-base percentage, at-bats, hits, doubles, walks and was
second in runs. He batted .288 and made only two errors.
	   Grieve is the fifth A's player to win the award, joining Walt
Weiss (1988), Mark McGwire (1987), Jose Canseco (1986) and Harry
Byrd (1952).
	   A September call-up by the A's in 1997, Grieve hit three doubles
and drove in five runs in his major league debut against San
Francisco. In 24 games that year, he batted .312 with three homers
and 24 RBIs, making him the early favorite for this year's rookie
award.
	   Arrojo and Hernandez, both Cuban defectors, were the top rookie
pitchers in the AL. Arrojo, who defected during the 1996 Olympics,
went 14-12 with a 3.56 ERA and made the All-Star team. Hernandez,
who fled Cuba on a raft last December, went 12-4 with a 3.13 ERA
after being called up June 3.
	   Caruso led AL rookies with a .306 average, but made 35 errors.

It's becoming an old story for Quartey
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ED SCHUYLER JR. &QC; 
 &UR; AP Boxing Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Ike Quartey's reaction when he was told his Nov.
21 fight against Oscar De La Hoya was off was short and to the
point like a sweetly thrown combination.
	   ``Damn ... again,'' the native of Ghana said. He now has to wait
until Feb. 13 to challenge WBC welterweight champion De La Hoya,
who was cut over the left eye while sparring Oct. 31.
	   It was the third time this year that a lucrative fight for
Quartey fell through and means he will go into the February match
without having fought since Oct. 17, 1997.
	   In April, Quartey was supposed to defend the WBA welterweight
title against Pernell Whitaker, but the fight didn't happen because
Whitaker tested positive for cocaine after another fight. Then he
was supposed to have a November bout with IBF champion Felix
Trinidad, but Trinidad got tied up in litigation with promoter Don
King.
	   ``It's affected my life and my career,'' said Quartey, who
relinquished the WBA title to challenge De La Hoya. ``It's not
fair. I'm not making any money.''
	   As for De La Hoya being cut, Quartey said Tuesday, ``I didn't
believe it because I heard he wasn't doing well in the gym. He
wasn't ready. I heard he was knocked down in the gym.''
	   ``Not true at all,'' De La Hoya said at a news conference at the
Original All-Star Cafe.
	   ``If you're not 100 percent inside the ring, don't fight because
you're risking everything,'' said De La Hoya (29-0, 24 knockouts),
boxing's biggest attraction outside the heavyweight division. ``I
was training hard and ready to fight, but I couldn't spar for the
last two weeks and it would be difficult to be in top shape.
	   ``This guy can fight. It's the toughest fight of my career.''
	   Quartey has a 34-0-1 record, with 29 knockouts.
	   The site of the TVKO pay-per-view match remains the Thomas &AMP;
Mack Center in Las Vegas.

British government calls for debt moratorium for affected

countries &QL; 
 &UR; EDS: UPDATES in grafs 7-9 with Irish doubling aid &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Central American nations ravaged by Hurricane
Mitch should be granted a moratorium on international debt
payments, Britain's top treasury official said Tuesday.
	   Gordon Brown, the chancellor of the exchequer, also said Britain
was prepared to contribute 10 million pounds (dlrs 17 million) to a
proposed World Bank trust fund.
	   ``The needs of the central American countries are now being
heard throughout the world and we want to do what we can and play
our full part with the rebuilding of the economies,'' Brown said.
	   ``We are proposing to the World Bank that a new trust fund be
set up to help the central American economies and we are prepared
to contribute 10 million (pounds).
	   ``We also believe a new facility should be created to help
rebuild the shattered economies and that what we proposed for
post-conflict economies in Africa we want also done for these
economies as well.''
	   Britain was also proposing, in a letter to the World Bank,
``suspension of world debt payments so that countries are given the
best chance to rebuild,'' Brown said.
	   Backing Brown's plea for a debt moratorium, the government of
the Irish Republic said it was doubling its emergency funding for
Central America, to 400,000 pounds (dlrs 640,000).
	   ''The capacity of heavily indebted countries such as Nicaragua
and Honduras to meet their debt obligations is now hopeless,'' said
Liz O'Donnell, a government minister responsible for overseas
development.
	   She said total debt in the region now is some dlrs 17 billion.
	   The Disasters Emergency Committee Appeal for Central America,
representing 11 British aid agencies, said members had already
received aid requests from the region in excess of 5 million pounds
(dlrs 8.5 million).
	   Britain's Ministry of Defense said 1,400 Royal Navy and Royal
Marines personnel were helping distribute aid in Nicaragua and
Honduras.

Kucera upset, Martin wins
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Kucera losing &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ Australian qualifier Wayne Arthurs
upset second-seeded Karol Kucera of Slovakia 7-6 (7-5), 7-6 (7-4)
in the dlrs 825,000 Stockholm Open Tuesday.
	   In the second round, Arthurs, a doubles specialist, will face
Todd Martin, a 6-1, 6-2 winner over Swiss qualifier Ivo Heuburger.
	   Arthurs, ranked 168th in the world, stunned the seventh-ranked
Kucera, who already has qualified for the ATP Championships in
Hanover, Germany, this month.
	   In the first-set tiebreaker, Arthurs took a 4-1-lead, before
winning on his first match point.
	   Arthurs appeared to falter early in the second set, dropping his
service, giving Kucera a 2-0 lead. But he recovered and won the
second tiebreaker for the biggest singles victory of his career.
	   ``My plan was to serve well, attack on Kucera's second serve and
win at the net,'' the left-hander said.
	   ``I had nothing to lose. If I lost, nobody would care. If I won,
everybody would be very surprised.''
	   Martin has played impressively the past few weeks.
	   ``This is a good surface for me,'' said Martin, ranked 22nd in
the world. ``If I can repeat the level of play I have achieved in
the last few weeks, I will certainly move up in the rankings next
year.''
	   Martin reached the final in the 1996 Stockholm Open before
losing to Thomas Enqvist.
	   In other matches, France's Cedric Pioline defeated wild-card
entry Andreas Vinciguerra of Sweden 6-3, 7-5 and Daniel Nestor of
Canada beat Johan van Herck of Belgium 6-3, 7-6 (7-2).
	   On Wednesday, top-seeded Pete Sampras begins play against Jason
Stoltenberg of Australia.

Canucks says they lost dlrs 21.6 million
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   VANCOUVER, British Columbia (AP) _ The Vancouver Canucks said
Tuesday they had lost dlrs 21.6 million last year and blamed it on
the weak Canadian dollar and high taxes.'
	   The loss has forced the team to seek additional funding from
John McCaw, owner of Orca Bay Sports and Entertainment, which owns
86 per cent of Northwest Sports Enterprises Ltd.
	   ``Most of our revenues are earned in Canadian dollars, while
players' salaries, which continue to increase, are denominated in
U.S. dollars,'' said Stephen Bellringer, the Canucks president and
CEO.
	   The dlrs 21.6 million loss is in U.S. money.
	   The Canucks, who have a payroll of around dlrs 27 million, have
a 6-5-1 record this season but have played before small crowds at
home.
	   Only 13,906, the smallest crowd ever at the 18,422-seat GM
Place, watched Vancouver lose 4-3 to Los Angeles on Monday night.

Munich beats Rostock, Kaiserslautern
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ Bernhard Winkler scored both goals
before being sent off and 1860 Munich regained second place in the
Bundesliga by beating Hansa Rostock 2-1 on Tuesday.
	   In another match, defending champion Kaiserslautern scored its
third victory in a row by edging Hamburger SV 1-0 to move into
third, behind leader Bayern Munich and 1860 Munich.
	   Bayer Leverkusen could move past both Kaiserslautern and 1860
Munich if it beats Hertha Berlin Wednesday.
	   Bayern Munich's game against bottom-placed Borussia
Moenchengladbach was called off because of a wet pitch and has been
rescheduled for next month. Bayern, which beat its crosstown rival
on Saturday 3-1, now has a five-point lead in the standings.
	   Moenchengladbach was busy off field, however, firing coach
Friedel Rausch and replacing him with Rainer Bonhof, a former
player with the club in its glory days in the 1970s.
	   In Munich, Winkler converted a penalty in the 34th minute to put
the home side ahead.
	   But the 10,000 fans saw the visitors equalize five minutes into
second halftime on substitute Henri Fuchs' header.
	   Less than two minutes later, Uwe Ehlers, whose cross set up
Rostock's goal, was sent off with his second yellow card of the
match.
	   Winkler took advantage of his team being one man up and notched
his second goal in the 73rd, raising his season total to eight. But
a blemish on his performance came when he was also sent off, one
minute before the end.
	   Before a crowd of 40,000 in Kaiserslautern, Uwe Roesler, brought
in at the start of the second half as Kaiserslautern's third
striker, delivered seven minute before time.

Italian movie director calls for nationwide protest against UEFA
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   FLORENCE, Italy (AP) _ As Fiorentina officials were preparing to
appeal the team disqualification from the UEFA Cup, renowned movie
director and Fiorentina supporter Franco Zeffirelli called for a
nationwide protest against the decision of Europe's highest soccer
authority.
	   ``It was an unfair decision ... and all Italian soccer fans
should take a strong stand against UEFA, which took a wrong
decision,'' Zeffirelli told the Italian news agency ANSA.
	   The Florentine team, the current league leader, was kicked off
the European competition Sunday as a punsihment for the explosion
that injured a match official and caused the suspension of the
Fiorentina-Grasshoppers UEFA Cup game in Salerno last week.
	   The game was suspended at half time, with Fiorentina leading the
second-leg 2-1 and 4-2 aggregate.
	   Fiorentina officials are appealing the UEFA decision on the
grounds the team was playing on a neutral field and that the device
was thrown into the field by a Salerno resident, in hate for the
Florentine team.
	   Fiorentina's appeal is likely to be heard by UEFA this weekend.
	   ``By qualifying Grasshoppers, UEFA has sent a message to many
crazy minds: that you can embezzle a sport with a criminal act ...
Fiorentina can't be punished for the behavior of a rival fan,''
Zeffirelli told ANSA.

Spain rules out discussing Basque independence in peace talks
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ The Spanish government has ruled out any
discussion of Basque independence in possible peace talks with the
armed separatist group ETA, an official said Tuesday.
	   The government will only negotiate terms for ETA to surrender
its weapons and the fate of more than 500 ETA prisoners, government
spokesman Josep Pique said.
	   ``In the peace process, this is all there is to talk about,''
Pique told reporters in Barcelona.
	   ETA, which stands for Basque Homeland and Freedom, has killed
nearly 800 people in its 30-year campaign for an independent Basque
nation carved out of parts of northern Spain and southern France.
	   The group began observing an open-ended cease-fire on Sept. 18.
	   Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar said last week his government is
willing to hold preliminary talks with ETA. The purpose of these
discussions would be for the group to confirm it really wants
peace, the government said.

Kurdish Information Center says German woman killed in Turkey Oct.
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   COLOGNE, Germany (AP) _ A German woman who was sought as a
terrorist in Germany, was killed by Turkish troops on Oct. 22,
after she was caught with a group of 39 Kurdish People's Freedom
Army members, a Kurdish information office said Tuesday.
	   According to a statement from the Kurdish Information Center in
Cologne, Andrea Wolf was captured along with 24 other members of
the Kurdish group and shot after short questioning that revealed
she was a German.
	   The Foreign Ministry in Bonn said Sunday it was investigating
reports by Der Spiegel and Focus magazines that said Wolf had been
captured and killed in southeastern Turkey.
	   Kurdish rebels have been fighting in southeastern Turkey for
over a decade for autonomy.
	   Spiegel of Hamburg said this weekend that Wolf, 33, had been
killed on Oct. 24. While Focus of Munich said she had been captured
in September.
	   German authorities were seeking Wolf as a suspect in the 1993
bombing of a prison by the leftist Red Army Faction gang at
Weiterstadt south of Frankfurt.

Latest knee injury not serious, Brazilian fit for Sunday
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MILAN, Italy (AP) _ Brazilian superstar Ronaldo will be on the
starting lineup of Internazionale Sunday as his latest knee injury
was not as serious as initially feared.
	   Club doctors said Tuesday that the young Brazilian striker, who
limped off the field with a bruised left knee during last Sunday's
Inter-AC Milan Serie A match, is going to resume training Wednesday
and will play the next league game against Sampdoria of Genoa.
	   He will miss, however, Wednesday's third-round second-leg of the
Italian Cup against Castel di Sangro.
	   ``Medical examinations showed Ronaldo's knee did not suffer any
serious damage,'' doctor Piero Volpi said.
	   The Brazilian, who has been off to a troubled season because of
tendinitis in both knees, was injured following a tackle by AC
Milan Danish midfielder Thomas Helveg.
	   Before leaving the field, at the end of the first half, Ronaldo
scored the opening goal in the 2-2 draw between the two crosstown
rivals.
	   It was Ronaldo's third goal in two and a half league games.
	   Ronaldo's uncertain form has been cited as one of the major
problems affecting Inter Milan, currently seventh in the 18-team
league standings, seven points behind leader Fiorentina.

Annan meets Moroccan king to discuss Western Sahara
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ABDELHAKIM YAMANI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MARRAKECH, Morocco (AP) _ U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan met
Tuesday with Morocco's King Hassan II and other leaders to discuss
the bitter dispute over the fate of the Western Sahara.
	   Annan is making a North African swing to discuss the dispute,
which has been bogged down by disagreement over who would be
eligible to vote in a referendum on the territory's future.
	   The United Nations has been working since 1991 to hold the
referendum on the vast desert area along the Atlantic Ocean, which
Morocco claims is part of its kingdom.
	   Polisario Front rebels seek the territory's independence. The
region was colonized by Spain until 1975.
	   Annan, visiting Marrakech after a trip to the territory, met
with Hassan alone for a half hour. Then the two presided over a
larger meeting of their aides.
	   No details were divulged from the closed-door meeting.
	   Annan also met with Moroccan Prime Minister Abderrahmane
Youssoufi, who expressed only his ``optimism'' on the future of the
Western Sahara, as well as the foreign and interior ministers, and
the heads of both chambers of parliament.
	   On Monday, Annan told reporters that neighboring countries, like
Mauritania, could contribute to resolving the nearly
quarter-century-old dispute.
	   ``The voice of neighboring countries is necessary and useful,''
Annan said. ``I am going to ... encourage them to work with us.''
	   Annan visited Mauritania before going to the Western Sahara. He
travels next to Tunisia and Algeria, which once actively backed the
Polisario and is the site of refugee camps in the south.
	   Last month, Annan suggested that the referendum _ originally
scheduled for next month _ be held in December 1999.
	   To date, 147,249 people have been declared eligible to take part
in the referendum. But the eligibility of another 65,000 is
contested.

Police free seven people being interrogated about Continuity IRA
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DUBLIN, Ireland (AP) _ Seven anti-British activists being
interrogated about possible involvement in an Irish Republican Army
dissident gang have been freed without charge, police said Tuesday
night.
	   An eighth person arrested Sunday following the annual conference
by Republican Sinn Fein _ a fringe political party opposed to
April's peace accord on Northern Ireland _ remained in custody
under Ireland's recently strengthened anti-terror laws.
	   Republican Sinn Fein, founded in 1986 by defectors from the
mainstream Sinn Fein party, denies having any formal link to an
outlawed group called the Continuity IRA, which has claimed
responsibility for several car bombs in British-ruled Northern
Ireland since 1996. It has refused to join the 15-month-old truce
being observed by the IRA.
	   Among those freed Tuesday was the son of the party's president,
Ruairi O Bradaigh, who was Sinn Fein's leader until being dethroned
by the party's current chief, Gerry Adams. O Bradaigh criticizes
Adams' acceptance of the peace accord on the grounds that it
doesn't achieve the abolition of Northern Ireland, a fundamental
IRA objective.

Tobacco foes target impotence in new campaign to kick the habit
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JOSEPH B. VERRENGIA &QC; 
 &UR; AP Science Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   Are you willing to give up your sex life for cigarettes?
	   For years, scientists have been warning that smoking can
contribute to impotence as well as fertility problems in men. Now
anti-smoking forces have seized on that finding as a potentially
powerful new way to get people to kick the habit.
	   In California, a dlrs 21 million campaign launched in June
includes a commercial showing a cigarette drooping limply. The
message: ``Cigarettes. Still Think They're Sexy?''
	   In Thailand, the health ministry ordered the nation's tobacco
monopoly to print a new warning on cigarette packs: ``Cigarette
smoking causes sexual impotence.''
	   In England, public health activists are lobbying for a similar
warning label.
	   The impotence risk _ and strategy _ are attracting media
attention, too. Last Sunday, CBS's television news show ``60
Minutes'' devoted a segment to the subject.
	   Activists are hoping the message will get through to people who
weren't deterred by the generations of warnings about
slow-developing threats such as cancer, emphysema and heart
disease, which altogether kill 400,000 smokers in the United States
annually.
	   ``What a terrible problem for the man because he is so
physically addicted,'' said Elizabeth Whelan, director of the
American Council on Science and Health, which opposes tobacco
companies. ``It will be interesting to see if this motivates men _
especially young men _ to disassociate themselves from that image
of impotence.''
	   Statistician Steven J. Milloy, who regularly contradicts what he
regards as ``junk science'' and frequently sides with the tobacco
industry, said anti-smoking forces are distorting a 1994 study by
the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that concluded that
smokers are twice as likely as nonsmokers to be impotent.
	   Milloy adjusted the CDC data to consider blood vessel disease,
hormone imbalances and other risk factors. As a result, he said,
the link between smoking and impotence became statistically
insignificant.
	   The impotence-and-smoking message has been boosted, in part, by
the runaway popularity of Viagra.
	   Pfizer Inc. reported that three of four men who participated in
its clinical trials for Viagra were smokers. And, Pfizer found, 21
percent of men with erectile dysfunction have underlying conditions
such as high blood pressure, heart disease and diabetes _ all of
which can be caused or complicated by smoking.
	   Urologists say smoking can diminish erections by reducing blood
flow in the penis, just as it can clog blood vessels to the heart.
	   In studies published since 1989, between 39 percent and 82
percent of the men suffering from vascular impotence were smokers.
	   Smoking can reduce fertility in men, too. Chemical compounds in
cigarette smoke can change levels of hormones and enzymes that
affect the number, shape and mobility of sperm _ all important
factors in conception.
	   Clive Bates, director of the London-based Action on Smoking and
Health, said the warnings about smoking and impotence are
shockingly effective because cigarettes are so often associated
with the after-sex experience.
	   ``The advantage of the penis from a communications point of view
is that it is easy to imagine it shriveled up and shrunken,''
Barnes said, ``whereas damage to other vital organs such as the
heart is much less obvious.''

Marseille downs Nancy to move five points clear at top
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Displaying more title-winning form, Marseille won
its seventh consecutive league match on Tuesday with a 3-2 win at
Nancy.
	   Florian Maurice fired a pair for the league leader, and has now
scored eight league goals this season.
	   Marseille raced to a 2-0 lead within 20 minutes.
	   First, Christophe Dugarry broke down the right and squared to
Maurice, who tapped in from five yards (meters).
	   Then, playmaker Jocelyn Gourvennec made it 2-0, collecting a
loose ball 20 yards (meters) from goal and smashing the ball past
goalkeeper Bertrand Laquait.
	   In the 50th minute, veteran Tony Cascarino scored an emotional
goal against the team he played for between 1994 and 1996.
	   But after brilliant work by Fabrizio Ravanelli, Maurice scored
again.
	   Ravanelli, captaining Marseille in place of the injured Laurent
Blanc, denied speculation before the match that he would be
returning to Juventus.
	   Christophe Bastien missed an 82nd minute penalty for Nancy,
though Soufiane Kone scored in injury time.
	   At the end, Nancy players thought that they had tied the game
when Bastien volleyed into the net - but the referee had already
blown the final whistle.
	   The result leaves Marseille on 33 points, five ahead of Bordeaux
and seven clear of third-placed Rennes.
	   Nantes missed its chance to climb the standings after being held
to a 1-1 home draw by lowly Le Havre.
	   Patrick Suffo scored with a deflected 20-yard (meter) shot in
the 12th minute, but Le Havre equalized with a Lilian Nalis goal.
	   Nantes stays in sixth place with 19 points.
	   On Wednesday, Bordeaux is favorite to collect three points at
Lorient, which lies just one place off the foot of the standings,
while Rennes has a tougher game at champion Lens.

	   The funerals came amid new violence in the Albanian-majority
Serbian province. A Kosovo Liberation Army guerrilla was killed and
a policeman wounded in a clash in the central village of Negrovac,
according to the Serb Media Center, the mouthpiece for Serb
authorities.
	   The report, which said the rebels attacked a police patrol,
could not be independently confirmed.
	   In Strovce, uniformed KLA guerrillas fired rifles in the air as
Hamdi Hajrizi, 25, was buried in the small village 25 kilometers
(15 miles) northwest of Pristina.
	   Dozens of his fellow guerrillas attended. All wore camouflage
uniforms displaying the red and yellow badges of the KLA.
	   Hajrizi was one of five KLA members, including a commander of
two brigades, killed last week when police opened fire on their two
cars near the central village of Opterusa. Police said the rebels
shot first.
	   Despite their tears, Hajrizi's relatives said they were proud he
joined the KLA.
	   ``He was the first to take up weapons. It's in our blood _ we're
a patriotic family,'' said his sister, Igballe Godeni, 28. ``We
support the KLA with all our strength. I had five brothers, and I
am prepared to lose them all to gain our freedom.
	   In Kosovo Polje, just outside Pristina, the funeral of policeman
Dejan Djatlov, 23, took place with little publicity. Foreign
journalists were asked to stay away.
	   Djatlov and a colleague were found shot to death on Monday in
Malisevo. Police called the slayings retribution for the killings
last week of Hajrizi and the other four KLA members.
	   Kosovo is a province of Serbia, Yugoslavia's dominant republic.
After a lull resulting from NATO threats to strike unless
authorities pull back police and army units that spearheaded a
nearly eight-month crackdown on Kosovo's separatist Albanians,
violence by both sides has increased in the past week.
	   Police have reported killing KLA fighters they said shot at them
first in at least four separate clashes.
	   In a separate report Tuesday, the Serb Media Center said two
Serb civilians disappeared in Srbica village _ apparent victims of
KLA abductions.
	   Adem Demaci, a political spokesman for the KLA, on Tuesday
accused Serb police of provoking the latest clashes and said any
violence committed by his side was self-defense.
	   But he did not comment on Serb accusations that Djatlov and the
other policeman were kidnapped and summarily shot by the rebels.
	   Serb police spokesman Bozidar Filic warned Monday that police
may increase patrols on main roads in Malisevo if foreign observers
fail to secure the thoroughfares. The Kosovo Information Service _
which reflects Albanian views _ suggested authorities were beefing
up forces in violation of their Oct 12 draw-down agreement, saying
13 busloads of Serb police had arrived in Kosovo on Tuesday.
	   The center also reported that three mutilated bodies of Kosovo
Albanians who had gone missing in early June had been found near
Klina, 45 kilometers (28 miles) west of Pristina.
	   In Moscow, a foreign ministry spokesman said the main threat to
peace in Kosovo comes from ethnic Albanian separatists, not the
government of Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic.
	   Russia has long been sympathetic to Serbia, made up of fellow
Slavs and Orthodox Christians.

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ In an unprecedented move that could lead
to a showdown on press freedoms, Athens' chief prosecutor Tuesday
put the country's newspapers on notice that executives face arrest
for publishing what authorities deem as sex-for-hire
advertisements.
	   ``It hits freedom of the press and includes all newspapers,''
said Fotis Siumburas, chief editor of the Athens afternoon daily
Apoyevmatini.
	   The move comes as Greek authorities struggle with a growing
corruption scandal that includes allegations of police protection
for prostitution rings. Some government opponents have called for a
moral crusade in the traditionally conservative nation.
	   Prosecutor Giorgos Koliokostas sent an order to the country's
security police demanding the arrest of the publisher and editor of
any newspaper which prints advertisements encouraging ``another's
vice,'' according to police and judicial sources. Trial could come
within 24 hours.
	   The order gives the police latitude to determine whether there
was a violation of the ban on sex-for-hire advertisements, which
apparently could include the many massage and escort notices that
fill pages in some newspapers.
	   Editors say it is not the first time that prosecutors have tried
to crack down on what many consider to be sex-for-hire ads. But in
the past, authorities could only act if someone complained.
	   ``Until now if there was something, if would be prosecution
after a complaint. We were acquitted of something like this a few
days ago,'' Siumburas said.
	   Prostitution is legal in Greece in state-registered brothels,
but an estimated 20,000 unregistered prostitutes _ most from
Eastern Europe _ are working in Greece.
	   The last time such a blanket order was issued against the media
was in 1991, when the conservative government then running Greece
issued a law banning the publication of statements issued by
terrorist groups.
	   A number of publishers was arrested at the time for defining the
ban, which was repealed shortly afterwards.

Tiger great Hal Newhouser dies at 77
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By RANDI GOLDBERG &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   DETROIT (AP) _ Hall of Famer Hal Newhouser, the only pitcher to
win consecutive Most Valuable Player awards, died Tuesday after a
long illness. He was 77.
	   A native of Detroit, Newhouser pitched for his hometown Tigers
from 1939-53 and led them to a World Series championship over the
Chicago Cubs in 1945. In the decisive seventh game, he pitched a
complete game.
	   Newhouser was the American League's MVP after going 29-9 in
1944. He won the honor again in 1945 when he was 25-9 with eight
shutouts.
	   Newhouser, elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1992, was on
seven All-Star teams, led the American League in wins four times
and in strikeouts and earned run averages twice.
	   After spending the final two years of his career with Cleveland,
Newhouser retired in 1955 with a 207-150 record and 3.02 ERA.
	   In July 1997, he became the only pitcher to have his uniform
number retired by the Tigers. His No. 16 is painted on the facing
of Tiger Stadium's third deck in right field.
	   ``I am very pleased,'' Newhouser said at the ceremony where his
number was retired. ``And I have to say if it wasn't for the
players that played in back of me, I would've never stood here
today.''
	   Several of Newhouser's surviving teammates from Detroit's 1945
world champions as well as other former Tigers stars were in
attendance.
	   ``It was much more fun playing with him than against him,'' Hall
of Fame third baseman George Kell said. ``If you wanted one pitcher
to start the seventh game of the World Series, which he did in
1945, you'd pick Hal Newhouser.''
	   Newhouser was only the fourth player to have his number retired
by the Tigers. The others were Charlie Gehringer (2), Hank
Greenberg (5) and Al Kaline (6). Detroit also retired No. 42 in
honor of Jackie Robinson.
	   Following his retirement, Newhouser went into banking for 20
years, then returned to baseball as a Michigan area scout for the
Houston Astros.

Mick Jagger doesn't like his daughter modeling, says Jerry
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Rolling Stone Mick Jagger would like his
14-year-old daughter to give up her budding modeling career and
stick to her homework, his wife Jerry Hall says.
	   This summer, some fashion writers wondered aloud if Elizabeth
Jagger was old enough to be on the catwalk as she appeared in shows
by top designers like Thierry Mugler and Vivienne Westwood. She
makes her cover debut on the front of the December issue of the
upmarket British magazine Harpers and Queen, to be published
Thursday.
	   In an interview in the same issue, her mother said Jagger is
''furious'' about Elizabeth's modeling and wants her ''to
concentrate on her schoolwork.''
	   ''He says it's really silly as she doesn't need the money,''
said Ms. Hall, herself a model.
	   ''But I tell him, almost every schoolgirl wants to be a model,''
Harpers and Queen quoted her as saying.
	   The tall blonde Texan said she put off letting Elizabeth model
as long as possible _ but gave in after model scouts ''who had no
idea who she was kept coming up to her and giving her cards.''

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   OTNIEL, West Bank (AP) _ Two Israeli civilians were wounded when
occupants of a Palestinian car opened fire as they passed the
Israeli vehicle, Israeli army radio said.
	   The shooting occurred the Jewish settlement of Otniel in the
southern West Bank.
	   ``We were sitting watching the municipal election results on
television when there were some very loud bursts of fire. It
sounded like an entire clip of ammunition,'' said Yehuda Glick, one
of the residents of the settlement.
	   Soldiers closed off the area.
	   The injured civilians were brought to a hospital in Beersheba.
One of them was seriously injured, the other suffered moderate
injuries, the radio said.

France canceling debts to Nicaragua, Honduras
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with debt figures; details on Chirac trip &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ France's finance minister confirmed on Tuesday that
France is canceling the debt of Nicaragua and Honduras, a gesture
to ease the devastation those countries have suffered from
Hurricane Mitch.
	   Dominique Strauss-Kahn made the announcement during a
question-and-answer session in parliament.
	   The confirmation came a day after Prime Minister Lionel Jospin
called for the move. It also came a day before President Jacques
Chirac leaves for the region devastated by Mitch.
	   Honduras and Nicaragua had appealed for help with their foreign
debts during a summit of Central American presidents Monday to
discuss a response to Hurricane Mitch, which they say killed some
10,000 people.
	   Nicaragua's debt to France is 392 million francs (dlrs 71
million), out of a total foreign debt of dlrs 6 billion. Honduras'
debt to France is 166 million francs (dlrs 30 million) out of a
total foreign debt of dlrs 4.2 billion.
	   U.S. President Bill Clinton last week requested a global relief
effort and issued orders boosting U.S. emergency aid to dlrs 70
million.
	   Chirac had long planned to visit Mexico and Guatemala. But he
decided this week to expand his visit to include Honduras,
Nicaragua and El Salvador, so he could view the damage firsthand
and judge the kind of help needed.
	   The president intends to meet with his counterparts in those
nations and ``evaluate with them the urgent needs and the more
long-term aid that Paris can bring to these countries,'' said
Chirac's spokeswoman, Catherine Colonna.
	   He will be accompanied by Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine. In
Mexico and Guatemala, he intends to focus on the economic role
France can play in the region.
	   Chirac is scheduled to address the Mexican parliament, and to
meet with President Ernesto Zedillo.
	   ``Mexico for us is a land of opportunity, because it is a
country three times the size of ours,'' Colonna said Tuesday.
	   Chirac also plans to sign a number of accords with Mexico,
including one strengthening cooperation in the field of education.

Ex-union head predicts mid-December settlement
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By CHRIS SHERIDAN &QC; 
 &UR; AP Basketball Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Charles Grantham, former director of the
players' union, thinks common sense will end the National
Basketball Association lockout in mid-December, leaving a shortened
but unusually competitive season.
	   ``The quality will be improved in a 50- or 60-game season,'' he
said Tuesday. ``The games will be more important. The guys will be
up.''
	   Explaining that owners are trying to protect long-term
investments and players are fighting for more immediate rewards,
Grantham predicts a side benefit arising from an eventual
settlement.
	   ``You won't have the wear-and-tear factor, and the players will
be recovered from the last 100-game season, which the body was not
built to withstand,'' said Grantham, executive director of the
union from 1988 to 1994. ``If they play it, you may see the best
NBA basketball season ever.''
	   The sides have not had full-scale bargaining in two weeks, and
it is now clear the season cannot begin before mid-December.
	   The union's negotiating committee is scheduled to meet Wednesday
in New York to discuss whether to put forth a new proposal for a
collective bargaining agreement.
	   ``Everybody knows there's a definite `drop-dead' date as to when
you can't get a season in. Certainly, it's before Christmas,''
Grantham said. ``Do I think they'll cancel the season? I don't
know. I can't be sure.
	   ``I think the owners are prepared to do it to protect their
business for the long haul, but I think there will be an agreement
and we will have basketball.''
	   Grantham resigned abruptly from his union post after negotiating
the no-strike, no-lockout agreement that allowed the 1994-95 season
to be played.
	   The league then imposed a lockout that lasted though the summer
of 1995, and it ended with the players voting against decertifying
their union and in favor of accepting a six-year deal negotiated by
Simon Gourdine, who succeeded Grantham.
	   ``The players thought that was going to be a six-year deal, but
in reality the owners knew it would be only a three-year deal,''
Grantham said. ``That deal also instituted the rookie salary scale
and tightened a soft salary cap, and now it's a question of whether
the players will accept an even harder cap.''
	   Grantham is now a producer on a film about Micheal Ray
Richardson, who was banned from the NBA for drug use and went on to
a long professional career in Europe. At 43, Richardson is still
playing in the Italian League.
	   Having sat across the bargaining table from commissioner David
Stern and deputy commissioner Russ Granik, Grantham has a unique
perspective on NBA labor relations.
	   He said the partnership between players and owners that led to
the establishment of the salary cap in the early 1980s began
falling apart in 1990 when the players and owners clashed over the
reporting of revenues.
	   That fight, Grantham said, fostered an atmosphere of mistrust
that has grown in the years since and can be seen in the current
standoff in which the owners insist the league is unprofitable and
the players do not believe them.
	   ``As you go into the next millennium, it's the league that
embraces players as their partners that will prosper,'' Grantham
said. ``And right now, the only league with that attitude seems to
be baseball.''

Iraq appeals to Arabs as impasse over U.N. inspections drags on
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: LEADS thruout to RECAST, RAISE Iraq looking for Arab support. &QL; 
 &UR; AP Photos BAG101-103 &QL; 
 &UR; With AM-US-Iraq &QL; 
 &UR; By EILEEN ALT POWELL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraq is reaching out for Arab support in
its dispute with U.N. weapons inspectors in hopes of leaving the
United States isolated in its campaign to rally backing for the use
of force against the Iraqis.
	   Iraq's foreign minister, Mohammed Saeed al-Sahhaf, chose an Arab
television station _ Qatar's Al-Jazeera _ for his first interview
on the dispute. The crisis began Oct. 31 when Iraq halted
cooperation with U.N. weapons inspectors.
	   Al-Sahhaf warned that ``any use of military force against Iraq
would lead to destabilizing the region.''
	   Hours later in Washington, President Bill Clinton met with
senior Pentagon officials Tuesday to explore options for a possible
military attack on Iraq. Defense Secretary William Cohen stepped up
the movement of U.S. ships into the region.
	   ``The military option is still on the table,'' Cohen said.
	   The United States and Britain have threatened military action to
force Iraq to resume cooperate with the weapons inspectors.
	   The inspectors must certify that Baghdad is rid of weapons of
mass destruction before the sanctions can be lifted. Sanctions were
imposed after Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
	   In mobilizing support for Iraq, the country's trade minister,
Mohammed Mehdi Saleh said Tuesday that America ``will lose from any
strike that takes place, and Iraq will gain.''
	   Asked how, Saleh said ``politically.'' It reflected Iraq's
thinking that sympathy for the Iraqis _ especially on the Arab
streets _ would leave the United States isolated in its campaign
against the Baghdad regime.
	   Saleh made his comments at the closing ceremony of a 10-day
trade fair in Baghdad that drew delegations from 30 countries, 17
of them Arab or predominantly Muslim.
	   The tactic of appealing to the Arabs is one indication of how
differently the current dispute is unfolding compared to one that
ended earlier this year.
	   When Iraq refused U.N. inspectors access to President Saddam
Hussein's palaces, Russia, France and Turkey rushed envoys to Iraq
to try to head off a military strike by the United States.
	   The dispute was resolved on Feb. 23 when U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan traveled to Baghdad and reached a last-minute agreement
with Saddam to open the palace compounds.
	   Iraq has said it will not resume cooperation with the U.N.
Special Commission until the Security Council begins to move toward
ending the sanctions.
	   There already are hints Iraq is prepared to go further in spite
of the U.S. and British threats.
	   Al-Thawra, a newspaper published by Saddam's ruling Baath Party,
said in an editorial Monday that ``the language of threats will
make it legitimate for Iraq to review everything concerning its
relations with UNSCOM and the Security Council.''
	   Western diplomats said this implied that Iraq could reject
long-term U.N. monitoring of its weaponry or payments of war
reparations, as required under U.N. resolutions.
	   Iraq _ and some other Arab countries _ apparently hope Annan
will again step in. In Washington, however, such reports were
discounted and officials said whatever diplomacy is going on has
been limited.
	   Iraq so far has let weapons experts stay in the country,
although they are not allowed to do field work
	   Iraq's Oct. 31 decision exempted nuclear experts, and teams from
the International Atomic Energy Agency have gone into the field
almost every day. On Tuesday, five teams visited five sites _ the
highest number this month.

<TEXT>
	   OTNIEL, West Bank (AP) _ Two Israeli civilians were shot and
wounded in a drive-by shooting near this Jewish settlement Tuesday,
apparently by Palestinian assailants, Israel's army radio reported.
	   The shooting occurred around 11:20pm (21:20gmt), just hours
after the Israeli government announced it had received new
assurances from the Palestinian Authority that it would take
necessary steps to fight militant groups. As a result, Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he would take the new
land-for-peace accord to his Cabinet for ratification Wednesday.
	   ``We were sitting watching the municipal election results on
television when there were some very loud bursts of fire, It
sounded like an entire clip of ammunition,'' Yehuda Glick, a
resident of Otniel, told the radio.
	   The Israeli army said it was checking the report.
	   Army radio said soldiers had sealed off the area and that the
two injured civilians were brought to hospital in Beersheba. One of
them was seriously injured, the other suffered moderate injuries,
the radio said. There were no other immediate details.

Williams at 80: a baseball mind forever sharp

	   CHANTILLY, Virginia (AP) _ U.S. Major League Baseball's last
pair of .400 eyes can barely see across the room. The legs that
circled the bases for 521 home runs now rest in a wheelchair.
	   But the mind is sharp, the wit remains. Get Ted Williams talking
about baseball, and the stories flow with vigor. The right index
finger flies in the air as he makes his point, and the voice
bellows with authority.
	   ``Joe Jackson got the big, big for-life penalty, and he served
his sentence,'' Williams said. ``I think he belongs in the Hall of
Fame.''
	   Appearing at a reunion of the 1969 Washington Senators and at a
promotion for a National Sports Gallery exhibit of great home run
hitters, Williams clearly was thrilled to be among old friends.
	   The 80-year-old Hall of Famer, making one of his increasingly
rare public appearances, signed autographs and traded stories about
everything from John Glenn _ with whom Williams served in the
Korean War _ to the 1998 home run duel between Mark McGwire and
Sammy Sosa.
	   ``The McGwire-Sosa thing was so super-great,'' Williams said.
``McGwire is the closest thing to gargantuan at the plate.''
	   Williams, weakened by several strokes, spends much of his time
watching television at home in Citrus Hills, Florida. He says the
biggest regret of his later years is that he can no longer indulge
his lifelong passion for fishing. He's selling his home in New
Brunswick, where people still remember the young Williams coming
north to wade the Canadian waters when he played with the Boston
Red Sox from 1939-1960.
	   But many of Williams' thoughts these days are with longtime New
York Yankees rival Joe DiMaggio, who is fighting pneumonia in a
Florida hospital. Williams speaks frequently with Dom DiMaggio,
Joe's brother, to keep informed on the condition of the ``Yankee
Clipper.''
	   ``I respected him,'' Williams said. ``He was a great example for
any young player to follow. I'm just sorry that as we talk today
that he isn't very well.''
	   Williams, a .344 lifetime hitter, is the last major leaguer to
break the .400 barrier. He went 6-for-8 in a doubleheader on the
final day of the season to finish at .406 in 1941. He was at .3996
at the start of the day _ .400, when rounded off _ and manager Joe
Cronin suggested Williams sit out the games.
	   ``I walked all over Philadelphia that night worried about not
hitting .400,'' Williams said, ``but not even thinking about not
playing.''
	   Williams, a member of the Old-Timers Committee for the Hall of
Fame, is also one of the leading advocates for the reinstatement of
Jackson, one of eight Chicago White Sox kicked out of baseball for
throwing the 1919 World Series.
	   ``He played great in the series. He hit the only home run in the
series,'' Williams said. ``Let them look at all the records. Get it
together where they're making a real honest attempt to be fair.''
	   Williams would also like to see baseball return to Washington,
which lost its team when the Senators moved to Texas in 1971. In
1969, Williams managed the last Senators team with a winning
record.

Increasing conflicts are blocking solutions for refugees
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By EDITH M. LEDERER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Conflicts forcing civilians to flee their
homes are increasing in number and intensity, slowing down and
often blocking solutions to refugee problems, the U.N. High
Commissioner for Refugees said Tuesday.
	   Even when political settlements are reached and people
voluntarily return to their homes, the peace established can at
best be described as ``fragile,'' Sadako Ogata told the U.N.
Security Council.
	   ``From our perspective, the increasingly blurred lines between
war and peace, and the necessity to reach out to victims of forced
displacement across those lines, make the protection of refugees
and returnees a more complex exercise than ever before,'' she said.
	   Ogata praised the Oct. 12 cease-fire agreement in Kosovo, a
province of the main Yugoslav republic of Serbia, because it had
wide political support and included humanitarian action and the
return of refugees as part of a larger peace building effort.
	   Hundreds of people died and an estimated 300,000 were driven
from their homes in fighting after Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic launched a crackdown Feb. 28 on ethnic Albanian
separatists in Kosovo.
	   Reached under the threat of NATO airstrikes, the cease-fire
agreement calls for withdrawal of Yugoslav special police and army
units, the return of refugees, unhindered international relief
operations and deployment of 2,000 unarmed monitors to verify that
all sides are abiding by its provisions.
	   ``If it is successful, I hope that the international involvement
in Kosovo can become a useful precedent to be replicated in other
situations,'' Ogata said. ``But let me be realistic. Decisive
international involvement is not the norm today.''
	   And she stressed: ``Where peace efforts are insufficient, or
ineffective, the ability of humanitarian agencies to help refugees,
returnees and other victims of conflict is greatly diminished.''
	   Because of instability in southern Sudan and Afghanistan, she
said, ``it is very difficult to address the immediate humanitarian
problems caused by actual population displacement.''
	   In central Africa, the unresolved conflict in Congo poses the
greatest worry because of the risk that large numbers of people
will flee their homes and because of the regional spill over, Ogata
said.
	   Humanitarian efforts are also less effective because of the
trend toward increasing violence against civilians in Africa, she
said, citing mutilations and killings by rebel forces in Sierra
Leone as ``the most horrifying example.''
	   Despite Ogata's praise of the Kosovo cease-fire, she said the
UNHCR is not promoting the repatriation of some 65,000 refugees
from Kosovo now in Montenegro, Albania and Macedonia because of the
fragility of the situation.
	   She said she was ``extremely concerned'' at the possibility of
renewed conflict in central Asia and in the Horn of Africa, which
is traditionally prone to large-scale population displacement.
	   ``My request to you is that when you discuss ongoing or
potential conflicts, you do not overlook the human displacement
factor, which _ as events have abundantly proved _ is often an
effect, but can also be a cause of conflict,'' she told the
council.
	   Since the U.S.-brokered cease-fire, she said, almost all people
displaced within Kosovo have returned to their villages _ but
``often to find their homes destroyed and their property looted.''
	   Ogata called for greater attention to post-conflict situations,
citing the 1.8 million people who remain uprooted in Bosnia,
Croatia and Yugoslavia.
	   In response to Ogata's speech, some council members raised
questions about ``political will'' _ why it existed in Kosovo but
not elsewhere.
	   ``I think this is something that governments will have to really
think through. I can raise it,'' Ogata said. ``I think strategic
interests of states is certainly a factor.''

Fiorentina defeats Lecce 4-0 in second leg, advances to
</HEADLINE>
quarterfinals &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LECCE, Italy (AP) _ League leader Fiorentina, paced by late
goals of its Latin American stars Edmundo and Gabriel Batistuta,
trounced second-division Lecce 4-0 and vaulted into the
quarterfinals of the Italian Cup.
	   Tuesday's win on the road, in a third-round second-leg game of
the competition, qualified the Florentine team on a 5-0 aggregate.
	   Following a goalless and hard-fought first half, at the Via del
Mare stadium, Portuguese midfielder Rui Costa converted a
controversial penalty kick to give Fiorentina a 1-0 lead in the
59th minute.
	   Defender Moreno Torricelli, with a successful raid into the
rival penalty area, made it 2-0 with a left-footed drive one minute
later.
	   Edmundo, who had wasted three clear scoring chances during the
first 45 minutes of play, tallied the visitors' third goal with a
powerful free kick from the long distance, in the 80th.
	   Argentine striker Gabriel Batistuta, the top league scorer with
10 goals in eight games, tallied the fourth goal with a diagonal
drive in the 88th.
	   Batistuta, fed by Edmundo, took advantage of the late scoring
opportunity in an otherwise lackluster performance.
	   It was the third goal in the competition for the Argentine
striker, who had scored Fiorentina's game winner in the first-leg
with Lecce two weeks ago.
	   Fiorentina, which leads Juventus by one point in the league
standings following a 4-1 rout of Venezia in Sunday's action,
struggled in the first half as Lecce combined tight defense with
fast counter-attacks .
	   Swiss international Davide Sesa led some dangerous attacks by
the home team at the start of the second half.
	   Then the penalty broke the balance and disheartened Lecce
players.
	   Before kickoff riot police charged groups of misbehaving Lecce
fans. Nobody was hurt in the incident and the game was played in an
otherwise peaceful situation, in front of 10,000 people.
	   Fiorentina's UEFA Cup match against Grasshoppers in Salerno last
week had been marred by the explosion of a device hurled from the
stands which injured a game official.
	   The Italian team has been disqualified from the European
competition pending an appeal which is expected to be heard by UEFA
this weekend.
	   Six other third-round second-leg games, including AC Milan
against defending Cup champion Lazio of Rome, were scheduled
Wednesday with AS Roma vs. Atalanta on Thursday.
	   Quarterfinal games are scheduled on Dec. 2 and Jan. 27.

Braves deal Neagle to Reds
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By RONALD BLUM &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ The Braves traded pitcher Denny Neagle to the
Cincinnati Reds on Tuesday as part of a deal that brought second
baseman Bret Boone to Atlanta, The Associated Press learned.
	   The deal also sent pitcher Mike Remlinger to the Braves and
outfielder Michael Tucker to the Reds.
	   No announcement was immediately made but the deal was confirmed
to the AP by a source who spoke on the condition he not be
identified.
	   Atlanta, seeking a second baseman at the start of what is
expected to be a transition period for one of baseball's most
successful franchises of the '90s, also had talked to Milwaukee
about sending Neagle to the Brewers as part of a trade for Fernando
Vina.
	   Minor league pitcher Rob Bell goes from Atlanta to Cincinnati as
part of the deal.
	   Neagle, a 30-year-old left-hander, was 16-11 with a 3.55 ERA for
the Braves last season, one of four Braves pitchers to win 16 games
or more.
	   But despite a seventh straight division title, Atlanta stumbled
again in the postseason and was eliminated by San Diego in the
National League championship series. The Braves, with the best
starting pitchers in baseball, have managed just one World Series
championship in the '90s.
	   Boone, 29, fills a void at second base. He hit .266 last season
with 24 homers and 95 RBIs. He takes over as the starter from Tony
Graffanino, who hit .211 with five homers and 22 RBIs in 289
at-bats.

Shooting erupts in northern city after arrests
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with situation calming
 &UR; By MERITA DHIMGJOKA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TIRANA, Albania (AP) _ A crowd took to the streets of a northern
city on Tuesday and fired shots in the air, the state news agency
ATA reported. They were protesting the arrest of three people who
reportedly confronted the president while armed.
	   The unrest in Shkodra, 85 kilometers (50 miles) north of Tirana,
began in the early afternoon after the arrests. The men were
detained about a week after reportedly walking toward President
Rexhep Mejdani while having arms on their person.
	   A police source originally said the men were charged with trying
to assassinate Mejdani. But the interior ministry later said the
men had been arrested on suspicion of theft. Two were later
released, but a third remained in custody late Tuesday.
	   A crowd of people who identified themselves as members of
anti-Communist unions gathered in the town's main square demanding
the release of the detained, ATA said. Later, they blocked off part
	   of the town and some of them started shooting in the air, said
ATA, without giving crowd figures.
	   By late Tuesday, some armed men had gained entry into the main
local government building, state television said. Ali Lacaj, the
prefect _ or Shkodra representative of the federal government _
said told reporters in phone interviews that he was with the men
but denied he was being held hostage.
	   The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe reported
its office in Shkodra had been looted of computers and other
equipment. Nobody had been hurt, said the organization.
	   The situation grew calmer before midnight, with the protesters
clearing the streets and vacating the government building. But they
said they planned more protests if the third man were not released
within 24 hours.

More bad news for Liverpool and Evans with 3-1 loss to Spurs
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ How many more hits can Liverpool manager Roy Evans
take?
	   The Reds, playing before a jeering crowd chanting ``Bye, bye
Evans'' _ and a half-full Anfield (20,600) _ were put out of the
League Cup Tuesday by Tottenham, 3-1 winners in the fourth-round
match.
	   Liverpool's defense and American goalkeeper Brad Friedel were
abysmal, and the side's passing wasn't much better. Tottenham was
average at best.
	   The loss is bound to increase the pressure on Evans, who has
shared the manager's job this season in a marriage with Gerard
Houllier with reports suggesting the Frenchman is about to be given
sole control of the club.
	   In other fourth-round League Cup matches Tuesday: Bolton 1,
Wimbledon 2; Luton 1, Barnsley 0.
	   In Wednesday's key fourth-round match, holders Chelsea faced
Arsenal as each club bids for the final eight.
	   Liverpool's loss comes on the heels of a 2-1 weekend beating by
Derby in the Premier League, leaving the under-achieving Reds with
only one league win in their last eight matches.
	   Steffen Ivensen scored for Tottenham in the second minute on a
header from 15 yards (meters) that sailed over Friedel, who had
wandered off his line.
	   In the 20th, John Scales made it 2-0 when he kicked home a ball
mishandled by Friedel in the box.
	   In the 62nd, Allan Nielsen made it 3-0 on a breakaway _ again
the fault of the Liverpool defense.
	   Eighteen-year-old Michael Owen scored a consolation goal for
Liverpool in the 81st. But even that brought bad news as Owen _
probably England's top international player _ limped off the pitch
moments later with what looked like a hamstring injury.
	   In Liverpool's defense, the club played without injured regulars
Steve McManaman, Patrik Berger and Jamie Redknapp.
	   In Wimbledon's win, Mark Kennedy got the deciding goal in the
63rd. Marcus Gayle opened the scoring for Wimbledon in the 16th
with Bolton's Claus Jensen equalizing in the 52nd for the
first-division side.
	   In the other League Cup match, second-division Luton beat
Barnsley of the first division 1-0 on Phil Gray's goal in the 81st.

Israel's Cabinet to reconvene to ratify peace accord

	   TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) _ Signalling that he was now satisfied
with Palestinian security assurances, Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu announced Tuesday he would convene his Cabinet to ratify
the latest Mideast peace accord.
	   Netanyahu has delayed or called off Cabinet meetings three times
since the deal was signed in Washington last month. After
complaints that the Palestinians were not doing enough to fight
terrorism, he said Tuesday that new guarantees led him to believe
that Yasser Arafat's Palestinian Authority would take ``practical
steps'' against Islamic militants.
	   However, a late night drive-by shooting near a Jewish settlement
in the West Bank left two Israelis wounded, and Israel's army radio
said the shooters were believed to be Palestinian. The Israeli army
and police said they were checking the report.
	   It was not clear whether the incident would effect the Cabinet
meeting but Netanyahu cut-short a Cabinet meeting Friday after a
sucide bombing in a Jerusalem market.

Tobacco foes target impotence in new campaign to kick the habit
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: CORRECTS name in last graf, should be Bates STED Barnes &QL; 
 &UR; By JOSEPH B. VERRENGIA &QC; 
 &UR; AP Science Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   Are you willing to give up your sex life for cigarettes?
	   For years, scientists have been warning that smoking can
contribute to impotence as well as fertility problems in men. Now
anti-smoking forces have seized on that finding as a potentially
powerful new way to get people to kick the habit.
	   In California, a dlrs 21 million campaign launched in June
includes a commercial showing a cigarette drooping limply. The
message: ``Cigarettes. Still Think They're Sexy?''
	   In Thailand, the health ministry ordered the nation's tobacco
monopoly to print a new warning on cigarette packs: ``Cigarette
smoking causes sexual impotence.''
	   In England, public health activists are lobbying for a similar
warning label.
	   The impotence risk _ and strategy _ are attracting media
attention, too. Last Sunday, CBS's television news show ``60
Minutes'' devoted a segment to the subject.
	   Activists are hoping the message will get through to people who
weren't deterred by the generations of warnings about
slow-developing threats such as cancer, emphysema and heart
disease, which altogether kill 400,000 smokers in the United States
annually.
	   ``What a terrible problem for the man because he is so
physically addicted,'' said Elizabeth Whelan, director of the
American Council on Science and Health, which opposes tobacco
companies. ``It will be interesting to see if this motivates men _
especially young men _ to disassociate themselves from that image
of impotence.''
	   Statistician Steven J. Milloy, who regularly contradicts what he
regards as ``junk science'' and frequently sides with the tobacco
industry, said anti-smoking forces are distorting a 1994 study by
the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that concluded that
smokers are twice as likely as nonsmokers to be impotent.
	   Milloy adjusted the CDC data to consider blood vessel disease,
hormone imbalances and other risk factors. As a result, he said,
the link between smoking and impotence became statistically
insignificant.
	   The impotence-and-smoking message has been boosted, in part, by
the runaway popularity of Viagra.
	   Pfizer Inc. reported that three of four men who participated in
its clinical trials for Viagra were smokers. And, Pfizer found, 21
percent of men with erectile dysfunction have underlying conditions
such as high blood pressure, heart disease and diabetes _ all of
which can be caused or complicated by smoking.
	   Urologists say smoking can diminish erections by reducing blood
flow in the penis, just as it can clog blood vessels to the heart.
	   In studies published since 1989, between 39 percent and 82
percent of the men suffering from vascular impotence were smokers.
	   Smoking can reduce fertility in men, too. Chemical compounds in
cigarette smoke can change levels of hormones and enzymes that
affect the number, shape and mobility of sperm _ all important
factors in conception.
	   Clive Bates, director of the London-based Action on Smoking and
Health, said the warnings about smoking and impotence are
shockingly effective because cigarettes are so often associated
with the after-sex experience.
	   ``The advantage of the penis from a communications point of view
is that it is easy to imagine it shriveled up and shrunken,'' Bates
said, ``whereas damage to other vital organs such as the heart is
much less obvious.''

Prince Charles website draws scores of e-mails

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ He's royal. He's on-line. And he's in demand.
	   Prince Charles' new Internet website has drawn e-mails from
people around the world seeking his views on everything from the
monarchy to alternative medicine.
	   The site, which contains articles and the text of speeches the
prince has made on some of his favorite topics, such as
architecture and organic farming _ and has already drawn critical
comments.
	   ``Sir, you have represented certain views toward genetic
engineering of foodstuffs, which I feel is too strong,'' wrote Ben
Rowden, of Guildford, southwest of London, objecting to the
prince's opposition to the genetic modification of food.
	   ``To simply refuse out of hand the use of genetics is to rule
out what may be of great value in the future.''
	   Others praised him.
	   Laurie Barry, of Walnut Creek, California congratulated the
prince on his taste in architecture, while Michael Thomas of Dumas,
Texas said: ''My hat off to Prince Charles for his hard work and
dedication and support for many worthwhile charities he has a part
in.''
	   Shawnee Heltsley, of Mercersburg, Pennsylvania urged the prince
to ``keep up the great work for our environment! Start a web page
about your work on farming.''
	   James William Hunter, of Calgary, Canada, wrote that he thought
the Internet an ideal medium for Charles to communicate with his
future subjects
	   ``Communication is indeed required as the monarchy enters the
next century,'' he said.
	   Charles' website follows the introduction in March 1997 of Queen
Elizabeth II's official Buckingham Palace website, which has become
one of the most popular Internet sites with more than 100 million
``hits'' in its first year.
	   Charles' website contains 354 pages. It chronicles the life and
work of the heir to the throne, who turns 50 on Saturday, and sets
out his views, upcoming engagements and news of the activities of
his charitable trust.
	   An Online Forum page designed to stimulate discussion highlights
issues of particular interest to the queen's eldest son and seeks
comments from web surfers.
	   ``This site provides us with a powerful way of getting across _
in an unfiltered way _ information about the prince,'' said Stephen
Lamport, Charles' private secretary.
	   ``We hope it will help people to understand the Prince of
Wales's work.''
	   The new site is at www.princeofwales.gov.uk.

	   OTNIEL, West Bank (AP) _ Two Israelis were shot and wounded in a
drive-by shooting near this Jewish settlement Tuesday, apparently
by Palestinian assailants.
	   The rear doors and one window of their white pick-up truck were
riddled with bullets. The vehicle carried Israeli army license
plates but there was no immediate confirmation that the two wounded
were soldiers. Dozens of Israeli troops arrived on the scene within
minutes and sealed off the area.
	   Soldiers said the attackers drove off towards the
Palestinian-controlled sector of Hebron in the West Bank, out of
the army's reach.
	   The two victims, aged 21 and 23, were brought to Soroka hospital
in Beersheba. Hospital spokeswoman Batya Kuris said one man was in
serious condition with a chest-wound. The other had small fragments
of glass in his head and his wounds were considered mild, she said.
	   Kuris said one of the wounded was a settler from Otniel and the
other was from the Israeli coastal town of Netanya.
	   The shooting occurred around 11:20pm (21:20gmt), just hours
after the Israeli government announced it had received new
assurances from the Palestinian Authority that it would take
necessary steps to fight militant groups. As a result, Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he would take the new
land-for-peace accord to his Cabinet for ratification Wednesday.
	   ``We were sitting watching the municipal election results on
television when there were some very loud bursts of fire, It
sounded like an entire clip of ammunition,'' Yehuda Glick, a
resident of Otniel, told the radio.
	   Spokesmen for the Israeli army and police said they were
checking the report.

Wang Xiufen of China sets two world records
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LAHTI, Finland (AP) _ Wang Xiufen of China set two new world
records Tuesday, winning the women's 53-kilogram class during the
first day of the weightlifting world championhips.
	   China took also the women's 48 kilos title through Li Yunli, who
had a total of 182.5 kilos. Chu Nan-Mei and Tsai Huey-Woah brought
the silver and bronze medals to Taipei.
	   Mutlu Halil of Turkey won the only men's title of the day, in
the 56 kilos, with a total of 295 kilos, ahead of Lan Shizhang of
China, and Ivan Ivanov of Bulgaria.
	   New women's 53 kilos record holder Wang Xiufen had 92.5 kilos in
the snatch - 2.5 off the world record - and then set records twice
in the clean-and-jerk. After a successful record attempt at 115
kilos Wang hoisted 117.5 kilos, for a new total record of 210
kilos. The result is 12.5 kilos over the world standard, required
for a new record.
	   Xiufen, 24, beat second placed Izabela Dragneva of Bulgaria by
17.5 kilos, and the bronze medalist, Robin Goad of the United
States by 27.5 kilos.
	   Goad, 28, of Newnan, Georgia, was third best in both
disciplines, and took the bronze medal in her 10th world
championship start. She was world champion four years ago.
	   The world weightlifting was newly organized at the beginning of
the year, with two classes dropped in both the men's and the
women's categories, in order to trim down the number of lifters for
the Olympics in Sydney to about 250. New class weights were
introduced, and minimum standards set for new world records.
	   In Lahti, 283 men and 151 women are competing.

<TEXT>
	   INDIANAPOLIS (AP) _ Scientists have coaxed a mouse into growing
an elephant egg in a technique that could someday be used to help
save some of the world's endangered species.
	   Mice could be used as factories to produce eggs of other
species; the eggs could then be fertilized and used to impregnate
the endangered animals.
	   Purdue University researcher John Critser led a team that
transplanted ovarian tissue from African elephants into lab mice
that had been bred so that their bodies wouldn't reject foreign
tissue.
	   Several of the mice developed egg-producing follicles and one
contained a mature _ though misshapen _ egg. The egg was not
considered healthy enough to produce a successful pregnancy, but
Critser's team had no intention of using it to impregnate an
elephant at this point anyway.

Tipper Gore visits Honduras to assess hurricane relief needs

<TEXT>
	   TEGUCIGALPA, Honduras (AP) _ The wife of the U.S. vice president
brought congressmen, medical supplies and a promise of an
additional dlrs 10 million in U.S. aid to hurricane-devastated
Central America on Tuesday.
	   Tipper Gore landed at the central Honduran air base of Soto Cano
on Air Force Two, took a U.S. C-130 cargo plane to Tegucigalpa, the
capital, and immediately went on a helicopter tour to view storm
damage.
	   She saw entire blocks of Tegucigalpa devastated by river
flooding and fields of destroyed and withering crops nestled among
the cloud-shrouded mountains that surround the capital.
	   ``The world must know the tragedy in Honduras is of biblical
proportions,'' Mrs. Gore said. ``We are here today because we are
neighbors who care and because you and we are all Americans.''
	   Mrs. Gore was meeting Honduran President Carlos Flores on
Tuesday and planned to help make dinner for shelter refugees at
Tegucigalpa's Manuel Bonilla School. She was staying overnight at
another shelter before leaving Wednesday for Managua, Nicaragua.
	   Mrs. Gore delivered an aid shipment that included blankets,
sheets and 500 gallons (1,900 liters) of drinking water for
residents who have had little since Mitch wreaked havoc on this
Central American country last month, killing 6,600.
	   Stressing Washington's commitment to long-term relief, she said
U.S. military engineers were rushing to Honduras to repair roads
and bridges and ensure that fuel and food could be moved to
stricken towns.
	   Experts with the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development also planned to come to Honduras to help local
authorities rebuild, she said.
	   Delivering aid donated by citizens in the states of Mississippi,
Louisiana and Georgia, Mrs. Gore said U.S. citizens already had
donated 1 million pounds in goods for Central American storm
victims.
	   The dlrs 10 million in new aid for various projects is in
addition to the dlrs 70 million the U.S. government already has
committed to Central America.
	   The United States also was signing agreements worth dlrs 2
million to help restore water service in Tegucigalpa, Mrs. Gore
said.
	   Mrs. Gore said she would phone President Bill Clinton from
Central America to update him on relief needs.
	   Mrs. Gore, Brian Atwood, who heads the U.S. Agency for
International Development, and the congressional delegation were
greeted in Tegucigalpa by Honduran first lady Mary de Flores and
U.S. Ambassador James Creagan.
	   Nicaraguan pitcher Dennis Martinez of the Atlanta Braves and
John Leonard, deputy assistant secretary of state for Latin
America, also accompanied Mrs. Gore.

Foes warn Kyoto global warming treaty won't survive Senate
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By KEVIN GRAY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) _ American foes of a landmark
global warming treaty warned Tuesday that the U.N. accord will be
blocked by the Senate if developing nations aren't forced to
curtail greenhouse gases.
	   U.S. congressional opponents of the 1997 Kyoto accord who are
attending the U.N. Climate Conference in Buenos Aires said the
meeting has not addressed key American demands _ especially a call
for developing nations to voluntarily pledge pollution reductions.
	   ``As this treaty stands now, it will not be ratified by the U.S.
Senate. It's dead on arrival,'' said Republican Rep. F. James
Sensenbrenner Jr. Treaty opponents charge the pact threatens
American industry.
	   When the 160 nations kicked off the summit Nov. 2, an effort by
the host Argentine delegation to add the issue of voluntary
pollution limits to the agenda was quickly rebuffed.
	   At stake is the gradual and potentially destructive warming of
the planet's atmosphere through the burning of coal, oil and gas.
	   Many scientists believe Earth is gradually warming because of
what are known as greenhouse gas emissions _ mainly carbon dioxide
from factories, power plants and automobiles. Critics say global
warming scenarios have not been proved.
	   Proponents of the treaty assured it would not force American
companies to take costly measures to reduce pollution.
	   ``By signing the agreement, the administration ensures that the
United States will have the credibility to continue to take a
leadership role in shaping ... these programs and in persuading the
developing nations to become a part of the solution,'' said Sen.
Joe Lieberman, D-Conn.
	   Developing nations and many European countries argue the United
States must do more domestically to curb greenhouse emissions.
	   Last year in Kyoto, Japan, countries agreed industrialized
nations should cut their pollution output by an average of 5
percent below 1990 levels by 2012.
	   ``We are the leading emitter of gases which cause global
warming. We cannot walk away from this problem,'' said Rep. Pete
DeFazio, an Oregon Democrat.

	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ Australian qualifier Wayne Arthurs
Tuesday upset second-seed Karol Kucera of Slovakia to set up a
second-round clash against American Todd Martin in the dlrs 825,000
Stockholm Open tennis tournament.
	   Arthurs, a 27-year-old doubles specialist from Adelaide, beat
the highly (7th) ranked Slovak 7-6 (7-5), 7-6 (7-4). The
Australian, who started the year at 282:nd in the ATP ranking and
improved to 168 before this tournament, is bound improve his
standing.
	   After trading service games midway through the first set, both
players held service to 6-6. Arthurs jumped to a 4-1-lead in the
tiebreak winning 7-5 on his first match point.
	   Arthurs seemed to lose control of the match early in the second
set dropping his service for a 2-0-lead for Kucera. But he
recovered and finally won the second tibreaker 7-4 for his sixth
singles win on the ATP tour and the biggest in his career.
	   ``My plan was to serve well, attack on Kuceras second serve and
win at the net,'' the Aussie lefthander said.
	   ``I had nothing to lose. If I lost nobody would cared, if I won
everybody would be very surprised,'' he added.
	   Earlier Tuesday Todd Martin powered his way into the second
round by whipping Swiss qualifier Ivo Heuburger 6-1, 6-2.
	   Martin, who has played impressively the last few weeks,
expressed satisfaction with his game recently and hoped to go far
in the tournament.
	   ``I will not predict how far, but this is a good surface for me.
If I can repeat the level of play I have achieved in the last few
weeks, I will certainly move up in the ATP ranking next year,''
said Martin, currently 22nd.
	   Martin reached the final in the 1996 Stockholm Open but lost to
Thomas Enqvist, a former two-fold winner of the tournament who was
upset Monday by lowly-ranked Japanese Takao Suzuki.
	   In other action Tuesday French veteran Cedric Pioline defeated
wild-card entry Andreas Vinciguerra of Sweden 6-3, 7-5, Daniel
Nestor of Canada beat Johan van Herck, Belgium 6-3, 7-6 (7-2). In
the evening session seventh-seed Thomas Johansson of Sweden
overcame Fabrice Santore of France 6-4, 7-6 (10-8), Vince Spadea of
the U.S., defeated Leander Paes of India, 7-6 (7-5), 6-1 and
Hendrik Dreekmann overpowered Sweden*s Magnus Norman 6-2, 2-6, 7-5.
	   Seven of the world's top 20 players entered in the tennis
tournament, one of the oldest indoors on the ATP circuit, that
began Monday.
	   Later Tuesday top seed Pete Sampras told a news conference that
he came to Stockholm Open to continue his quest to finish 1998
ranked No. 1 for a record sixth straight year.
	   ``I am here to win. I had two missions before this season -- to
equal Roy Emersons record of 12 Grand Slam titles and be ranked
number one for a sixth unprecedented year,'' he said.
	   He failed to accomplish the first goal but still has the chance
to top Jimmy Connors five-year streak.
	   ``That will be decided in the ATP-finals in Hanover. But If win
in Stockholm Ill have an excellent chance to achieve my goal,''
Sampras added.
	   His scheduled opponent Wednesday is Australian Jason Stoltenberg
who has lost to Sampras the four times they've met. .

France, Cuba lead efforts to ease debts of Mitch-damaged countries

<TEXT>
	   MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) _ France and Cuba announced Tuesday they
were forgiving Nicaragua's foreign debt to help it recover from
Hurricane Mitch.
	   The French government also canceled debts owed by Nicaragua's
neighbor, Honduras, while Ireland announced it was doubling aid to
Central American nations ravaged by the storm.
	   Britain said it hoped to contribute to a trust fund for the
region and added its support to calls for a moratorium on debt
payments by all affected countries.
	   President Arnoldo Aleman announced France's forgiveness of
Nicaragua's debt, calling it ``a message of optimism which surely
will stimulate other countries to take the same decision.''
	   French Finance Minister Dominique Strauss-Kahn, speaking in
Paris, confirmed the decision and added that the cancellation
applied also to Honduras.
	   Nicaragua and Honduras had appealed for help with their foreign
debts during a summit that Central American presidents held Monday
to discuss responses to Hurricane Mitch, which they say killed some
10,000 people.
	   Nicaragua's total foreign debt totals dlrs 6 billion, dlrs 70
million of which it owes to France.
	   Honduras owes a total of dlrs 4.2 billion, dlrs 30 million of it
to France.
	   Honduran President Carlos Flores Facusse on Monday called the
sum his country owes ``unpayable'' in the wake of a disaster he
said had set his nation back 50 years.
	   Cuba announced it was canceling Nicaraguan debts of dlrs 50
million, nearly all of which was apparently borrowed by Nicaragua's
leftist Sandinista government in the 1980s.
	   ``The government of Cuba has decided to completely forgive the
debt of Nicaragua with Cuba,'' Cuban Foreign Minister Roberto
Robaina said in Havana.
	   Robaina also repeated his government's offer of medical
personnel _ an offer accepted by Honduras but rejected by
Nicaragua's Aleman, who has been a bitter critic of Cuba's
communist government.
	   Nicaraguan Foreign Ministry spokesman Cesar Ubeda said Tuesday
his government ``is grateful to the Cuban people'' for forgiving
the debt. He pointedly left out any reference to the Cuban
government.
	   On Tuesday, the Central American Bank of Economic Integration,
the financial arm of the Central American common market, approved a
dlrs 300 million loan to reconstruct Nicaragua, Honduras, Guatemala
and El Salvador.
	   Britain's top treasury official, Gordon Brown, called Tuesday
for the suspension of debt payments so that countries damaged by
Mitch ``are given the best chance to rebuild.''
	   Brown, the chancellor of the exchequer, added that Britain was
prepared to contribute dlrs 17 million to a proposed World Bank
trust fund to help the central American economies.
	   Backing Brown's plea for a debt moratorium, the government of
the Irish Republic said it was doubling its emergency funding for
Central America, to dlrs 640,000.
	   German Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer has also urged that some
debt be forgiven.

New, better arthritis drugs promise relief with fewer side effects
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; RETRANSMITTING to fix slug &QL; 
 &UR; By PHIL GALEWITZ &QC; 
 &UR; AP Business Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ The pharmaceutical industry is announcing big
gains in the fight against arthritis this week, with several
companies reporting they can now reduce pain and slow progression
of the often debilitating illness.
	   The federal government has approved two new drugs to treat
rheumatoid arthritis since September, drugs that aim to help those
with moderate-to-severe forms of the disease.
	   But industry observers say the biggest advances will occur next
year with the expected approval of arthritis drugs made by Searle
Inc. and Merck and Co. These drugs will treat the pain and
inflammation associated with arthritis without the stomach problems
associated with today's over-the-counter and prescription drugs,
the companies say.
	   These drugs, called Cox-2 inhibitors, are likely to be marketed
to people with rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis _ or nearly
40 million Americans.
	   The arthritis drugs, those in testing and those on the market,
are being showcased this week at the American College of
Rheumatology meeting in San Diego, where each company is trying to
show arthritis doctors why its treatment works best.
	   ``This is a tremendous time,'' said Dr. Brian Butcher, an
official with the Arthritis Foundation. ``We have gone from where
we could not offer much hope to people to where we can diagnose,
provide early treatment and stop the progression of the disease.''
	   Rheumatoid arthritis afflicts 2.1 million Americans. It occurs
when patients' immune systems go awry and attack their joints,
causing inflammation and stiffness as rogue immune cells eat away
cartilage. Osteoarthritis affects more than 37 million Americans,
and is usually associated with the aging process.
	   In the past year, doctors wrote 76.7 million prescriptions for
anti-arthritis drugs, according to IMS Health, a research group.
With a number of new drugs coming on the market, analysts expect
sales to increase from dlrs 1.9 billion to dlrs 3 billion by 2001.
	   Among its many players, the pain wars pit Merck, the largest
drug company worldwide in terms of sale, against the fastest
growing company, Pfizer. Pfizer will market Celebra, the Cox-2
inhibitor made by Searle, a division of Monsanto. The federal Food
and Drug Administration's advisory committee has scheduled a
hearing on Celebra for Dec. 1.
	   Merck hopes to file for FDA approval for its Vioxx drug later
this year. Company officials say they are not concerned about
lagging behind Celebra for federal approval. One reason is because
Vioxx is designed as a once-a-day pill, while Celebra will have to
be taken several times daily.
	   Dr. Bennett Shapiro, an executive vice president with Merck,
attributed the surge of interest in arthritis to scientific
discoveries in 1991 that showed that two different enzymes cause
the body to make hormones that bring pain and inflammation and also
protect the stomach lining. As a result, drugs could be developed
that stopped the pain, but left the stomach alone.
	   Immunex Corp., which won federal approval last week for its
Enbrel arthritis drug, is working with American Home Products Corp.
to market it. Enbrel is given via injection twice a week and
studies show it reduces pain and duration of morning stiffness and
improves swollen and tender joints. Enbrel used the meeting in San
Diego to show that the drug is also effective in children.
	   Centocor Inc. used the meeting to show its experimental drug
Remicade also provides relief from rheumatoid arthritis. Remicade
is already approved to treat Crohn's disease, an intestinal
disorder. The company hopes to win approval to treat arthritis with
the drug next year.
	   Enbrel and Remicade will compete with Arava, the arthritis drug
approved by the FDA in September. Arava, made by Hoechst Marion
Roussell, bills itself as the only approved drug that helps stop
the progression of rheumatoid arthritis.

IAEA sees no Iraqi pullout for its nuclear inspectors
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: STANDS as a 1st Ld-Writethru to some points to CLARIFY in graf
2 that IAEA pullout followed crisis last year. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ The International Atomic Energy Agency
has no plans to suspend nuclear monitoring work in Iraq in
solidarity with United Nations weapons inspectors, a U.N. spokesman
said Tuesday.
	   David Kyd, spokesman for the Vienna-based IAEA, ruled out such
an action, as was done after another inspections crisis last year,
without orders to that effect from the U.N. Security Council.
	   Iraq's Oct. 31 decision to halt inspections is aimed at the U.N.
Special Commission, whose inspectors are charged with eliminating
Iraq's biological and chemical weapons as well as long-range
missiles.
	   The Iraqi ban exempts monitors from the IAEA, whose nine
inspectors in Iraq have been carrying out ``business as usual,''
Kyd said.
	   ``If the Iraqis were so careful to differentiate'' between the
two groups, the spokesman said, ``why should we hitch our wagons to
the UNSCOM team?''
	   Some of the agency's U.N. sponsors expressed reservations
following the IAEA's unilateral action last time, he added.
	   Kyd acknowledged that the scope of the inspections remains
severely limited by restrictions imposed by Baghdad in August.
	   ``For the time being, our work is unhampered as long as we keep
to the declared sites, accompanied by our Iraqi counterparts ...
our minders,'' he said.

<TEXT>
	   LA MACHACA, Colombia (AP) _ As the government and leftist rebels
prepare for peace talks to end a 34-year civil war, the guerrillas
have begun flexing their muscle in a massive area from which
President Andres Pastrana has pulled his troops.
	   ``Nobody's going through. Orders from above,'' said Orlando, a
machine-gun-toting rebel manning a roadblock that kept a six-car
convoy of journalists from venturing deeper into guerrilla
territory on Monday.
	   ``We're exercising 24-hour control in this zone,'' said the
bespectacled, 25-year-old fighter in camouflage clothes.
	   Vehicles carrying local residents went through, but only after a
meticulous search under a scorching sun.
	   Ceding to a guerrilla security demand, Pastrana last weekend
withdrew the last of about 2,000 troops and soldiers from a
16,200-square-mile (42,000-square-kilometer) region where peace
talks are expected soon with the country's largest rebel group.
	   For at least 90 days, the guerrillas will have free reign over
an area of southern Colombia the size of Switzerland.
	   As expected, rebels from the Revolutionary Armed Forces of
Colombia, FARC by its Spanish initials, are emerging from the
woods.
	   ``I've never seen so many guerrillas around here, '' said
18-year old Sonia Cruz.
	   Cruz's family's farm is a few hundred yards (meters) before the
roadblock five miles from La Sombra _ a nearby hamlet where FARC
captains have been holding court this week, summoning local
authorities, students and businessmen for lengthy chats.
	   The agenda of the government-rebel talks is expected to include
longstanding rebel demands to redistribute land to peasants to
clean up Colombia's traditionally corrupt political system.

Iraq appeals to Arabs as impasse over U.N. inspections drags on

	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraq is reaching out for Arab support in
its dispute with U.N. weapons inspectors in hopes of leaving the
United States isolated in its campaign to rally backing for the use
of force against the Iraqis.
	   Iraq's foreign minister, Mohammed Saeed al-Sahhaf, chose an Arab
television station _ Qatar's Al-Jazeera _ for his first interview
on the dispute. The crisis began Oct. 31 when Iraq halted
cooperation with U.N. weapons inspectors.
	   Al-Sahhaf warned that ``any use of military force against Iraq
would lead to destabilizing the region.''
	   Hours later in Washington, President Bill Clinton met with
senior Pentagon officials Tuesday to explore options for a possible
military attack on Iraq. Defense Secretary William Cohen stepped up
the movement of U.S. ships into the region.
	   ``The military option is still on the table,'' Cohen said.
	   The United States and Britain have threatened military action to
force Iraq to resume cooperate with the weapons inspectors.
	   The monitors must certify that Baghdad is rid of weapons of mass
destruction before the sanctions can be lifted. Sanctions were
imposed after Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
	   Nizar Hamdoon, Iraq's ambassador to the United Nations, said
Tuesday that ``we have to prepare ourself for a strike obviously _
this does not mean that we don't encourage diplomacy.''
	   He said Iraq has kept channels open through U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan's special representative in Baghdad,
Prakash Shah, but that ``nothing really has moved today.''
	   In mobilizing support for Iraq, the country's trade minister,
Mohammed Mehdi Saleh, said Tuesday that America ``will lose from
any strike that takes place, and Iraq will gain.''
	   Asked how, Saleh said ``politically.'' It reflected Iraq's
thinking that sympathy for the Iraqis _ especially on the Arab
streets _ would leave the United States isolated in its campaign
against the Baghdad regime.
	   Saleh made his comments at the closing ceremony of a 10-day
trade fair in Baghdad that drew delegations from 30 countries, 17
of them Arab or predominantly Muslim.
	   The tactic of appealing to the Arabs is one indication of how
differently the current dispute is unfolding compared to one that
ended earlier this year.
	   When Iraq refused U.N. inspectors access to President Saddam
Hussein's palaces, Russia, France and Turkey rushed envoys to Iraq
to try to head off a military strike by the United States.
	   The dispute was resolved on Feb. 23 when Annan traveled to
Baghdad and reached a last-minute agreement with Saddam to open the
palace compounds.
	   This time, Iraq's defiance is not over a technical issue _ such
as whether palaces were subject to inspection _ but over the
premise of whether there should be an inspection program.
 &UR; Iraq has said, pick up 14th graf pvs.

Two Israelis wounded in drive-by shooting
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with comments from Netanyahu's adviser, detail from

previous attacks &QL;

<TEXT>
	   OTNIEL, West Bank (AP) _ Two Israelis were shot and wounded in a
drive-by shooting near this Jewish settlement Tuesday, apparently
by Palestinian assailants.
	   An Israeli official said the government was waiting for more
details before it could assess how the incident may effect the
peace process.
	   The rear doors of the victims' white pick-up truck were riddled
with bullets and the back and side windows were smashed. The
vehicle carried Israeli army license plates but there was no
immediate confirmation that the two wounded were soldiers.
	   Dozens of Israeli troops arrived on the scene within minutes and
sealed off the area.
	   Soldiers said the attackers drove off towards the
Palestinian-controlled sector of Hebron in the West Bank, out of
the army's reach. The truck was sitting in the middle of an
undivided highway near a West Bank crossing which leads to Hebron.
The Jewish settlement of Otniel is about 1.6 kilometers (1 mile)
east of the junction.
	   The two victims, aged 21 and 23, were brought to Soroka hospital
in Beersheba. Hospital spokeswoman Batya Kuris said one man was in
serious condition with a chest-wound. The other had small fragments
of glass in his head and his wounds were considered mild, she said.
	   Kuris said one of the wounded was a settler from Otniel and the
other was from the Israeli coastal town of Netanya.
	   ``We were sitting watching the municipal election results on
television when there were some very loud bursts of fire, It
sounded like an entire clip of ammunition,'' Yehuda Glick, a
resident of Otniel, told the radio.
	   The shooting occurred around 11:20pm (21:20gmt), just hours
after the Israeli government announced it had received new
assurances from the Palestinian Authority that it would take
necessary steps to fight militant groups. As a result, Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he would take the new
land-for-peace accord to his Cabinet for ratification Wednesday.
	   Asked if the incident would effect the Cabinet meeting,
Netanyahu's senior adviser, David Bar-Illan told The Associated
Press ``It depends very much on the actions of the Palestinian
Authority, what they do in response and what they've done until now
to prevent such actions,'' he said.
	   ``When the picture is clearer we'll know from what's happened
whether they have been lax or whether they are doing whatever can
be expected of any police force,'' Bar-Illan said.
	   A Palestinian security official, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said Yasser Arafat's chief security men in the West Bank
were in contact with their Israeli counterparts and cooperating
over the incident. The official said Palestinian police were
setting-up roadblocks in Hebron and looking for the assailants.
	   There have been a spate of attacks on Israelis by groups who aim
to derail the peace process since the two sides began talking again
in late October after 18 months of stalemate. On Friday, the
militant group Islamic Jihad carried out a suicide bombing in a
Jerusalem market, wounding 21.
	   Several days earlier a suicide bomber tried to ram his
explosives-laden car into a school bus carrying Israeli children in
the Gaza Strip. One soldier was killed protecting the children. A
Hamas activist threw two hand grenades into a crowded bus station
in the southern city of Beersheba and four Israelis were killed in
three separate shooting incidents. In the last attack, a Jewish

Reports: Nippon Life, Germany's Deutsche Bank to form venture
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan's Nippon Life Insurance Co. and Deutsche Bank
AG, Germany's largest bank, have agreed to form a joint-venture
asset management company, Japanese newspapers reported Wednesday.
	   Nippon Life and Deutsche Bank will set up an investment-advisory
company in London next spring to handle asset management in Europe,
the Nihon Keizai newspaper said.
	   Nippon Life, Japan's largest insurer, will take a two-thirds
capital position in the venture, with Deutsche Bank holding the
remaining one-third, the reports said.
	   The amount of capitalization and other details will be worked
out later, the Nihon Keizai said. The two companies are to announce
the deal later Wednesday, said the Yomiuri, Japan's largest
mass-circulation daily.
	   Under the planned venture, Nippon Life will establish a global
network for investment trust and asset management that will cover
three core markets across the world _ Japan, the United States and
Europe, according to the Yomiuri.
	   The reports also said Nippon Life will increase its stake in
Deutsche Bank's Japanese trust-banking subsidiary to 10 percent, up
from the current 5 percent.
	   In October, Nippon Life strengthened an alliance with Putnum
Investments, a major U.S. asset management company, to develop an
investment trust product line.
	   Nippon Life, established in 1889, is Japan's top insurer with
total assets of 42.2 trillion yen (dlrs 348.7 billion) as of March
1998, the Yomiuri said. It has 12,001 in-house staff and 63,850
salespeople.
	   Deutsche Bank, established in 1870, is headquartered in
Frankfurt. The bank is Germany's largest comprehensive financial
institution.

Pinochet lawyers say extradition will harm British-Chile relations

 &UR; By MAUREEN JOHNSON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Lawyers for Gen. Augusto Pinochet told Britain's
highest court Tuesday that upholding the former dictator's arrest
would upset British-Chile relations as well as endanger democracy
developed in Chile since he stepped down in 1990.
	   ``The British government has acquiesced or lent its support to
the process of transition,'' said lawyer Claire Montgomery, arguing
for Pinochet on the fourth day of the hearing in the House of Lords
where he is fighting his Oct. 16 arrest on a Spanish extradition
warrant.
	   ``If judicial restraint was ever called for it is called for in
this case,'' she added.
	   Several of the five judges in the House of Lords interrupted,
questioning her argument that they base a decision on whether it
would upset a foreign government.
	   Ms. Montgomery reiterated that, despite an official finding in
Chile that some 3,000 people were murdered or disappeared at the
hands of the secret police during Pinochet's 1973-90 rule, the
Chilean government has asked for his immunity.
	   Spanish and British prosecutors have appealed an Oct. 28
decision by the High Court quashing Pinochet's arrest on grounds
that as a former foreign head of state he has immunity from
prosecution in this country.
	   The hearing was expected to continue through Wednesday and
perhaps part of Thursday. Judgment will likely be given next week,
court officials said.
	   Pinochet, 82, arrested on allegations of genocide, torture and
kidnapping while recuperating from back surgery in London, remains
in hospital under police guard.
	   Lawyers for the prosecutors, citing the Nuremberg trials of
Nazis after World War II and more recent trials of Bosnian Serbs
and Rwandan Hutus for war crimes or mass murder, say Pinochet, too,
is responsible for deeds beyond immunity.
	   Although 12 proceedings _ the latest filed Tuesday by the
National Association of Journalists _ have been instigated against
him in Chile, Pinochet has enjoyed immunity from prosecution there
as a senator for life and under laws he introduced after
overthrowing Salvador Allende, an elected Marxist. The latest legal
claim charges Pinochet's regime with repression of the media,
naming 20 journalists who the group says were killed, illegally
detained or tortured during his rule.

Kucera upset, Martin wins

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with late matches &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ Australian qualifier Wayne Arthurs
upset second-seeded Karol Kucera of Slovakia 7-6 (7-5), 7-6 (7-4)
in the dlrs 825,000 Stockholm Open on Tuesday.
	   In the second round, Arthurs, a doubles specialist, will face
Todd Martin, a 6-1, 6-2 winner over Swiss qualifier Ivo Heuburger.
	   Arthurs, ranked 168th in the world, stunned the seventh-ranked
Kucera, who already has qualified for the ATP Championships in
Hanover, Germany, this month.
	   In the first-set tiebreaker, Arthurs took a 4-1-lead, before
winning on his first match point.
	   Arthurs appeared to falter early in the second set, dropping his
service, giving Kucera a 2-0 lead. But he recovered and won the
second tiebreaker for the biggest singles victory of his career.
	   ``My plan was to serve well, attack on Kucera's second serve and
win at the net,'' the left-hander said.
	   ``I had nothing to lose. If I lost, nobody would care. If I won,
everybody would be very surprised.''
	   Martin has played impressively the past few weeks.
	   ``This is a good surface for me,'' said Martin, ranked 22nd in
the world. ``If I can repeat the level of play I have achieved in
the last few weeks, I will certainly move up in the rankings next
year.''
	   Martin reached the final in the 1996 Stockholm Open before
losing to Thomas Enqvist.
	   In other matches, France's Cedric Pioline defeated wild-card
entry Andreas Vinciguerra of Sweden 6-3, 7-5; Daniel Nestor of
Canada beat Johan van Herck of Belgium 6-3, 7-6 (7-2); seventh-seed
Thomas Johansson of Sweden beat Fabrice Santore of France 6-4, 7-6
(10-8); Vince Spadea defeated Leander Paes of India 7-6 (7-5), 6-1;
and Hendrik Dreekmann beat Sweden's Magnus Norman 6-2, 2-6, 7-5.
	   On Wednesday, top-seeded Pete Sampras begins play against Jason
Stoltenberg of Australia.

Braves get Bret Boone, give up Neagle
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with background; CHANGES byline and dateline &QL; 
 &UR; By JOE KAY &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CINCINNATI (AP) _ The Atlanta Braves began retooling their
roster Tuesday by acquiring Gold Glove second baseman Bret Boone
from the Cincinnati Reds for starter Denny Neagle and outfielder
Michael Tucker.
	   The Braves also got left-handed reliever Mike Remlinger and gave
up minor league pitcher Rob Bell, who led the Carolina League with
197 strikeouts last season.
	   After failing to make it to the World Series for a second
consecutive season, the Braves were willing to give up a key
component in their splendid rotation to upgrade their lineup.
Neagle, 30, went 16-11 with a 3.55 ERA last season, when he was one
of five Atlanta starters to win at least 16 games.
	   ``We felt we were overwhelmed and had to make a deal,'' Reds
general manager Jim Bowden said of Atlanta's offer.
	   Nine teams approached the Reds about Boone, who won his first
Gold Glove and made his first All-Star team last season. Boone, 29,
led the Reds with 24 homers and 95 RBIs, all career highs.
	   ``I hated to trade Bret,'' general manager Jim Bowden said.
``He's someone I've been probably the closest to in my baseball
career. It was the most difficult thing I've had to do. We paid a
big price but without starting pitching, you can't compete.''
	   The Braves have been looking to improve their everyday lineup
after another flame-out in the playoffs. Atlanta has won seven
straight division titles but only one World Series in the '90s.
	   San Diego's pitchers held down the Braves to a .235 average and
just 18 runs in winning the NL championship series 4-2 last month.
	   Boone takes over as the starter from Tony Graffanino, who hit
.211 with five homers and 22 RBIs in 289 at-bats, and Keith
Lockhart, who batted .257 with nine homers and 37 RBIs. Remlinger,
32, was 8-15 with a 4.82 ERA in 28 starts and seven relief
appearances.
	   Neagle, 30, went 20-5 for Atlanta in 1997 and has won at least
16 games in each of the last three seasons. He becomes Cincinnati's
most accomplished starter.
	   Tucker, 27, hit .244 with 13 homers, 46 RBIs and eight stolen
bases this year. He made dlrs 370,000 on a team that had the
highest payroll in the National League at dlrs 61.7 million and the
fourth-highest overall.
	   Bell, 21, is a hard-throwing right-hander who went 7-9 with a
3.28 ERA in 28 starts for Danville last season.

Baseball '98: The wealthy win

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Unless you spent, you lost in U.S. Major League
Baseball this year.
	   Only one team with a payroll of more than dlrs 48 million had a
losing record _ the Baltimore Orioles, who went 79-83 despite
spending a record dlrs 74 million on players, according to figures
compiled by management's Player Relations Committee.
	   Conversely, only one team with a payroll of less than dlrs 47
million had a winning record. The Toronto Blue Jays were 88-74 and
spent dlrs 37.3 million, according to the report, which was
circulated Tuesday at the general managers' meeting in Naples,
Florida and obtained by The Associated Press.
	   The eight playoff teams all were among the top 12 in payroll.
Missing out on the postseason among the big spenders were
Baltimore, Los Angeles, the New York Mets and Anaheim.
	   The New York Yankees, who won the World Series for the second
time in three seasons, were less than dlrs 200,000 behind the
Orioles, coming in at dlrs 73.8 million. That includes dlrs 8.2
million in termination pay: dlrs 2.5 million to Oakland for Kenny
Rogers, dlrs 1.6 million to San Francisco for Charlie Hayes, dlrs
1.6 million to the released Dale Sveum and dlrs 2.5 million to
Minnesota as part of the Chuck Knoblauch trade.
	   Texas, eliminated by New York in the first round of the
playoffs, was third at dlrs 62.2 million, followed by Atlanta (dlrs
61.8 million), eliminated by San Diego in the NL championship
series. The Padres were 10th at dlrs 53.0 million.
	   Teams that spent less than dlrs 37 million not only lost _ they
lost big. All 12 teams under that figure lost 88 games or more and
only three of them finished within 20 games of first place _
Oakland (14 games back with an dlrs 18.6 million payroll), Kansas
City (16 1/2 games back with a dlrs 35.6 million payroll) and
Minnesota (19 games back with a dlrs 22 million payroll).
	   Montreal had the lowest payroll at dlrs 8.3 million, the least a
team has spent since the 1990 Baltimore Orioles were at dlrs 8.1
million.
	   Florida, which had the fifth-highest payroll in 1997 at dlrs
52.5 million and won the World Series, got rid of nearly all its
stars, slashed its payroll to dlrs 19.1 million (27th among the 30
teams) and finished with the worst record in baseball at 54-108, 52
games behind first-place Atlanta.
	   Baseball's average salary increased 4.8 percent, from dlrs 1.31
million to a record dlrs 1.38 million, according to the PRC. The
median _ the amount where an equal number of players earn above and
below _ went up from dlrs 400,000 to dlrs 427,500, still short of
the record dlrs 450,000 set in 1994 before the 232-day strike.

Islamic experts pleased with human rights seminar

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ A two-day conference on Islam and human rights
marks a start in efforts to promote greater understanding between
Muslim and Western ideals, participants said Tuesday.
	   ``There is no incompatibility between Islam and human rights,''
said Sahib ben Cheikh, an Algerian scholar and mufti _ interpreter
of religious law _ of Marseille, France.
	   ``The dream is to introduce Islam as a heritage of all
humanity,'' ben Cheikh said at the close of the session on Islamic
perspectives on the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.
	   The meeting, which grouped 20 experts of Islamic law, was
criticized by some human rights organizations because they had no
chance to participate.
	   U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights, Mary Robinson, convened
the meeting in a bid to break down cultural barriers. It was
decided that only selected scholars should be allowed to speak in
order to avoid polemics.
	   U.N. officials say they hope to have follow up seminars with
wider participation.
	   ``The fact that there has not been an exchange where non-Muslims
could put questions to these experts is very regrettable,'' said
ben Cheikh.
	   Kamel al-Sharif, secretary general of the International Islamic
Council for Daw'a (religious calling) and Relief, said he agreed
with Mrs. Robinson that it was better to have a closed meeting of

Kodak cuts several hundred jobs at copier plant
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ROCHESTER, New York (AP) _ Eastman Kodak Co. eliminated several
hundred jobs at a copier assembly plant Tuesday because of
declining demand from a major buyer.
	   Kodak sold most of its money-losing copier division in 1996 to
British-based Danka Business Systems PLC for dlrs 680 million. It
makes copiers for Danka at its huge Elmgrove plant in Gates, a
Rochester suburb.
	   Danka has seen a sharp decline in revenues, profit and stock
price over the last year, and analysts had predicted that as many
as 500 to 1,000 employees at Kodak would lose their jobs this week.
	   ``We're not giving out a precise number for competitive
reasons,'' spokesman Charles Smith said. ``But it's in the low
hundreds _ it's well below 500.''
	   The job cuts come on top of plans at Kodak to carve out more
than dlrs 1 billion in costs and trim 19,900 jobs from its
worldwide payroll of 100,500 through the end of 1999.
	   The dlrs 16 billion photography company took a tumble last year
when Japanese rival Fuji slashed color-film prices in the United
States. The price brawl same as Kodak racked up big losses from
futuristic digital products.

Muslim parents convicted of abducting ``too Norwegian'' daughter

<TEXT>
	   OSLO, Norway (AP) _ In a trial about clashing cultures as well
as laws, a Muslim couple from Morocco was convicted Tuesday of
abducting their daughter because they felt she had become too
Norwegian.
	   The daughter, identified only as 19-year-old Nadia, grew up
mostly in Norway and like many Norwegian teens liked to go out
dancing and drinking alcohol _ in violation of Islamic religious
teachings.
	   In trial at Oslo City Court, she claimed her parents found such
behavior appalling, and forcibly brought her to Morocco in hopes of
changing her views.
	   The trial was avidly watched by native Norwegians and immigrants
alike. It was seen as setting a legal benchmark for tolerance of
traditional customs and religious beliefs that can conflict with
what activities and attitudes commonly accepted in liberal Norway.
	   In its ruling, the Oslo court found the parents guilty of
abducting their daughter. It sentenced the father to 15 months and
the mother to one year in prison, plus fines and court costs
totaling 75,000 kroner (dlrs 10,000).
	   However, the court suspended the jail sentences. The public
prosecutor who filed the case said sending the parents to jail
would make family reconciliation more difficult.
	   During the trial, Nadia testified she was drugged, handcuffed
and driven in a van for five days before arriving in Morocco in
August 1997.
	   ``Mama said the house was on fire, and that we had to get out.
She helped me put on clothes and make it down the stairs,'' Nadia
testified. ``When I looked around, there was no fire. I shouted for
help once, but then Mama put her hand in front of my mouth and
pushed me in the van.''
	   Norwegian officials discovered what happened after Nadia's
employer at a grocery store reported her missing when she failed to
show up at work. Norway's ambassador to Morocco, Arne B.
Honningstad, managed to track her down in her parents' hometown of
Nador.
	   In court, he said Nadia told him by phone that she was being
held against her will. He spoke with her parents on her behalf.
	   Honningstad quoted Nadia's mother as screaming, ``All Norwegian
women are whores. I don't want Nadia to be Norwegian,'' according
to an account of the trial published by the Oslo newspaper
Aftenposten.
	   After a month, Nadia's father gave in and allowed his daughter
to return to Norway, where she went into hiding and would only
appear in court. Norwegian police then charged the parents with
kidnapping.
	   The parents claimed Nadia had travelled with them willingly.
	   ``There were never any problems between me and Nadia about
religion or her lifestyle,'' the father said in court.
	   The parents said they would appeal the ruling to a higher court.
Neither their names nor Nadia's last name were reported, in keeping
with Norwegian practice.

carried ``i'' or ``f'' category codes. Some of the items below have
moved on this circuit in expanded form:
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ The Pentagon stepped up the movement of
warships to the Gulf on Tuesday and the United States swept aside
the idea of negotiations with Iraq over U.N. weapons inspections.
Defense Secretary William Cohen warned that if Saddam Hussein
continues to refuse the U.N. inspections, he risks strikes that
would cause a ``significant degradation'' of his military strength.
``Iraq is on notice,'' Cohen said. ``The military option is still
on the table.'' President Bill Clinton met for 90 minutes with his
top national security advisers, reviewing military and diplomatic
options. He also worked the phones, conferring with leaders in
Britain and Israel. (US-IRAQ)
	   MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) _ France and Cuba announced Tuesday they
were forgiving Nicaragua's foreign debt to help it recover from
Hurricane Mitch. The French government also canceled debts owed by
Nicaragua's neighbor, Honduras, while Ireland announced it was
doubling aid to Central American nations ravaged by the storm and
Washington pledged another dlrs 10 million. Britain said it hoped
to contribute to a trust fund for the region and added its support
to calls for a moratorium on debt payments by all affected
countries. President Arnoldo Aleman announced France's forgiveness
of Nicaragua's debt, calling it ``a message of optimism which
surely will stimulate other countries to take the same decision.''
French Finance Minister Dominique Strauss-Kahn, speaking in Paris,
confirmed the decision and added that the cancellation applied also
to Honduras. (MITCH-DEBT)
	   TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) _ The Israeli Cabinet was scheduled to
meet Wednesday to ratify the latest Mideast peace accord, delayed
three times already _ the last time after a suicide bombing by
Islamic militants. Late Tuesday, two Israelis were shot and wounded
in a drive-by shooting near the Jewish settlement of Otniel,
apparently by Palestinian assailants. An Israeli official said the
government was waiting for more details before it could assess how
the incident may affect the peace process. Netanyahu had said
earlier Tuesday that new security guarantees had led him to believe
that Yasser Arafat's Palestinian Authority would take ``practical
steps'' against Islamic militants. The United States and the
Palestinians welcomed the announcement. (ISRAEL-PALESTINIANS)
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ The government assembly meets again
Wednesday to carve out a new political future for Indonesia amid
street protests and a massive security clampdown. The People's
Consultative Assembly, Indonesia's highest legislative body, met at
the national Parliament, guarded by thousands of armed troops and
surrounded by razor wire. Tuesday night, a convoy of 30 buses
carrying student protesters, some sitting on the roofs and waving
red and white Indonesian flags, drove past the Parliament. They
taunted phalanxes of police and soldiers lined up in front of the
gates, but there were no clashes. In several areas earlier in the
day, however, pro- and anti-government activists faced off,
throwing rocks before soldiers broke up the fighting.

	   FORT LAUDERDALE, Florida (AP) _ A Colombian air force plane
carrying 1,600 pounds (725 kilograms) of cocaine was seized by U.S.
Customs at an airport. Customs inspectors boarded the C-130
Hercules on Monday after it landed at Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood
International Airport. They examined eight large metal pallets,
four of which contained cocaine, officials said. ``I assume
responsibility,'' air force Cmdr. Gen. Jose Manuel Sandoval told
reporters in Colombia. He said the air force wasn't systematically
involved in drug trafficking, even if some of its members were, and
he offered to resign. He said the air force hadn't decided whether
to suspend or dismiss any or all of the six-man crew.

	   A summary of financial and business news from The Associated
Press at 0000 GMT. Stories carry ``f'' or ``i'' category codes and
move on this circuit in expanded form:
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Most stocks fell again Tuesday, but Internet and
blue-chip technology shares forged ahead despite pressures to take
profits after a month of big gains. The Dow Jones industrial
average gave back a 26-point gain and fell 33.98 points _ or by 0.4
percent _ to 8,863.98, its second down day in a row after a string
of eight sessions without a loss. (US-CLOSING STOCKS)
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ The dollar rose to a one-month high against the
Japanese yen Tuesday for the second straight day on lingering
questions about Japan's economic recovery and doubts about whether
U.S. interest rates will be cut again soon. The dollar was slightly
lower against the German mark in quiet trading amid a lack of
market-moving news. Against the yen, the dollar was quoted at
122.52 yen in late New York trading, up from 121.57 late Monday.
The U.S. currency also was changing hands at 1.6842 marks, down
slightly from 1.6874. (US-DOLLAR)
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Growth in American workers' productivity, the
key to rising living standards, improved in the July-September
period after nearly stalling during the previous quarter. The
productivity of nonfarm, nonsupervisory workers _ measured as
output per hour of work _ rose at a seasonally adjusted 2.3 percent
annual rate in the third quarter, the Labor Department said
Tuesday. During the April-June period, productivity advanced at a
scant 0.3 percent rate, the slowest increase in nearly two years.
Productivity was robust during the first three months of the year,
rising at a 3.5 percent rate. Economists consider productivity the
key to prosperity. (US-ECONOMY)
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Despite financial crises in Asia and Russia
and slower global economic growth, world business giants may spend
up to a record dlrs 440 billion expanding overseas operations this
year, an international trade report said Tuesday. These investments
are the engine driving globalization of the world economy and are
increasing as nations' financial systems become more intertwined,
according to an annual report by the U.N. Conference on Trade and
Development. But Asia's financial turmoil may put a brake on flows
to that region for the first time since 1985. China, the boom
economy for developing countries, will experience a slowdown after
six years of rapid gains, the report says, projecting investment in
China this year at dlrs 40 billion, down dlrs 5 billion from 1997.
(WORLD INVESTMENT)
	   PARIS (AP) _ Commercial jetmaker Airbus Industrie will surpass
archrival Boeing in new plane sales by the end of the year, the
consortium's chief executive said Tuesday. Noel Forgeard, speaking
at a luncheon with reporters, said he expects Airbus will have sold
well over 500 planes by year's end, gaining a market share of more
than 50 percent for new plane sales. He said Airbus would boost
production by roughly 25 percent to between 285 and 290 planes next
year, and that it would deliver 232 planes this year, just short of
a projection the consortium made earlier this year. Forgeard also
said he expects the consortium to reach an output of 300 planes by
2000 and that this year's estimated production is already double
that recorded in 1996. (FRANCE-AIRBUS)
	   MINNEAPOLIS (AP) _ Cargill Inc. is buying the worldwide grain
operations of rival Continental Grain Co. in a deal that would
solidify Cargill's position as the biggest U.S. grain exporter.
Under a deal announced Tuesday, Cargill will acquire Continental's
grain storage, transportation, export and trading operations in
North America, Europe, Latin America and Asia. Terms were not
disclosed, but USA Today said in advance of the announcement that
analysts estimated the price could be more than dlrs 300 million.
The deal comes amid a consolidation in the agricultural industry
which has been hurt by falling prices and lower demand from Asia.
(US-CANADA-BUSINESS BRIEFS, 1st Ld)
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Wheat prices, now at their lowest levels in 11
years, are expected to rise slightly due to an aid deal with
Russia, the government said Tuesday. The forecast price change,
though small, is welcome news for U.S. farmers. The government also
said corn production was up 1 percent from last month. With a
forecast of 9.84 billion bushels, corn production is heading toward
what could be the second-largest volume and second-largest yield on
record. Wheat prices are projected to rise 10 cents to at least
dlrs 2.55 per bushel. While still low, the mark is a slight rebound
from last month when wheat was fetching dlrs 2.45 a bushel.

	   LONDON (AP) _ Rolling Stones star Mick Jagger would like his
14-year-old daughter to give up her budding modeling career and
stick to her homework, his wife, Jerry Hall, says.
	   This summer, some fashion writers wondered aloud if Elizabeth
Jagger was old enough to be on the catwalk when she appeared in
shows by top designers like Thierry Mugler and Vivienne Westwood.
	   She makes her cover debut on the front of the December issue of
the upmarket British magazine Harpers and Queen, to be published
Thursday.
	   In an interview in the same issue, her mother said Jagger is
``furious'' about Elizabeth's modeling and wants her ``to
concentrate on her schoolwork.''
	   ``He says it's really silly as she doesn't need the money,''
said Hall, herself a model.
	   ``But I tell him, almost every schoolgirl wants to be a model,''
Harpers and Queen quoted her as saying.
	   Hall, a tall, blonde Texan, said she put off letting Elizabeth
model as long as possible _ but gave in after model scouts ``who
had no idea who she was kept coming up to her and giving her
cards.''

	   RAMALLAH, West Bank (AP) _ Yasser Arafat on Tuesday invited
Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip to ring in the new millennium
in the Palestinian territories.
	   Arafat met with the Duke of Kent, a cousin of the queen, during
the duke's three-day trade mission to Israel and the autonomous
Palestinian areas. Arafat invited the royal couple for the ``2000
celebrations.''
	   The Palestinians hope to attract tourists to their millennium
festivities, especially in Palestinian-run Bethlehem, the
birthplace of Jesus.
	   The duke said he knows of no plans by the queen to visit.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   OBERHAUSEN, Germany (AP) _ Christo, the artist who wrapped the
Reichstag in silvery fabric, said Tuesday he will return to Germany
to spruce up an enormous prewar oil tank with colorful barrels.
	   The artist and his wife, Jeanne-Claude, plan to bisect a
110-meter (360-foot)-high tank built in 1929 with a wall of painted
barrels. The project, called ``The Wall,'' is to open April 30 with
a 10 mark (dlrs 6) entrance fee.
	   ``We want to create a friendly contrast with the colorful
barrel-wall to the gloomy, depressing oil tank,'' Christo said.
	   The couple's wrapping of the Reichstag drew enormous crowds in
1995.
	    &UR; ___ &QC; 
	   LONDON (AP) _ Princess Diana's memorial says it will help
victims of land mines but will not pay to have the devices removed.
	   The fund said in a statement Tuesday that the 1 million pounds
(dlrs 1.7 million) it has available for the cause would cover just
a fraction of the cost of removing mines. It said the money should
instead help victims.
	   Diana drew attention to the issue when she walked through a
minefield in Angola in 1997. She died in a car crash in Paris later
that year.
	   The fund's decision dismayed one group involved in clearing
mines.
	   ``We face the ludicrous situation of the Diana memorial fund
doing nothing to help a cause to which she gave a very clear and
very important commitment,'' said Lou McGrath, director of the
Mines Advisory Group.

	   NEW YORK (AP) _ His fortunes rose with ``Titanic,'' but will
Leonardo DiCaprio be too pudgy to make it on ``The Beach''?
	   The heartthrob has put on 10 kilograms (20 pounds), thanks to a
combination of junk food, nightclubbing and a knee operation that
kept him out of the gym, the New York Post reported Tuesday.
	   The extra weight has Danny Boyle, director of DiCaprio's next
movie, a little worried, the Post said.
	   DiCaprio is due to start shooting ``The Beach'' in January. His
dlrs 20 million starring role will require him to spend a lot of
time in bathing suits and shorts.
	   DiCaprio is now reportedly on a stringent diet and has scaled
back the party life in an effort to fit the part.
	   His agent, Cindy Guagenti, called the Post report ``gossip.''
	   ``The reason he is working out is to get prepared for his role
as many actors do. He has not gained 20 pounds (10 kilos). That is
ridiculous,'' Guagenti said.

Jesse Jackson urges Nigerians to push ahead to democracy
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By GILBERT DA COSTA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ABUJA, Nigeria (AP) _ U.S. envoy Jesse Jackson on Tuesday
appealed to Nigeria's ruler to put the country's political past
behind him and push ahead toward democracy.
	   ``Things are now happening for the better in Nigeria,'' Jackson
told reporters after meeting for closed-door talks with Gen.
Abdulsalami Abubakar.
	   He said the main thrust of his talks with Abubakar were to
encourage him on the positive steps he has taken as head of state _
but he also warned that challenges remain.
	   ``I have a tremendous sense of hope about the elections next
year but I also think we will do well to warn Nigerians and to
challenge them to look beyond the elections to what the real
challenges are in economic and other fields,'' he said.
	   Nigeria, hobbled by mismanagement, waste and rampant corruption,
remains an economic cripple despite producing 2 millions of barrels
of oil a day. The world's sixth-largest producer of oil cannot even
refine enough gasoline for its own use and poverty is rampant.
	   In addition, Nigeria faces such problems as bitter ethnic
disputes and a political class viewed as thoroughly corrupt.
	   Abubakar has dramatically altered Nigeria's course since coming
to power in early June, after the sudden death of dictator Gen.
Sani Abacha. Most prominently, he has scheduled presidential
elections for February and has vowed to step aside in May.
	   While many analysts believe the military will find a way to hold
onto at least some of their power, few question Abubakar's resolve
to shift Nigeria's political direction.
	   ``Things are happening now for the better in Nigeria,'' said
Jackson, who returned to the commercial capital of Lagos on Tuesday
evening for meetings with politicians, including the family of the
late opposition leader Moshood Abiola.
	   Jackson also submitted to Abubakar a list of concerns given to
him by representatives of the Ogoni community of southeastern
Nigeria. The Ogonis, who remain mired in poverty despite living in
the oil-rich Niger River delta, have long felt cut off from the
central government.
	   ``I had a good meeting with the leaders in their struggle for
minority rights, in their quest for a fair formula of resource
distribution,'' Jackson said. He did not detail the concerns, but
said Abubakar promised to discuss the issues with the Ogoni leaders
and described the general's response as ``enormous and sensitive.''
	   Tuesday marked the three-year anniversary of the execution of
Ogoni leader and writer Ken Saro-Wiwa. Saro-Wiwa and eight other
Ogoni environmental and human-rights activists were accused of
treason and involvement in a string of killings and were hanged by
Abacha's regime.
	   It is widely believed, however, that the nine were executed for
their criticism of the regime.
	   Jackson, a Baptist minister and civil rights leader, arrived in
Nigeria on Monday and leaves Wednesday. He is to return to the
United States on Nov. 14 after visits to Guinea, Sierra Leone and
Ghana.

In Belarus, government sticks with state controls for economy

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MINSK, Belarus (AP) _ Russia's tattered economy casts an ominous
shadow over Belarus, but this Slavic nation has so far escaped
being dragged down by its neighbor's troubles.
	   President Alexander Lukashenko, who runs things with a heavy
authoritarian hand, says it's all because Belarus is going its own
way and ignoring the West's model.
	   While Russia and other former Soviet republics have struggled,
and often failed, to build market economies, Belarus has stuck to a
formula that relies on large government subsidies to
state-controlled farms and industries.
	   Such economic thinking may be out of fashion, but Lukashenko
says Belarus' stability beats Russia's chaos any day. The
government claims the economy grew 11 percent last year and is up
another 11 percent this year.
	   Critics say the figures are misleading because the country has
been printing large sums of money, leaving the currency almost
worthless. It takes 50,000 Belarusian rubles to buy one U.S. dollar
at the official exchange rate and twice that on the black market.
	   Generous government subsidies have temporarily revived
production at inefficient factories that were in sharp decline, but
economic troubles seem to be building.
	   Inflation has hit 30 percent this year, unemployment is believed
to be much higher than the official 2 percent rate, and the full
effects of the economic plunge in Russia could yet descend on
Belarus, which does much of its trade with its neighbor.
	   The World Bank says the Belarus path is dangerous. It points out
that the country is facing a mounting trade deficit and a sharp
fall in hard-currency reserves.
	   Still, Belarus has not suffered the economic shocks Russia has,
and Lukashenko says he has fulfilled his promise to keep factories
working and living standards stable, albeit at a relatively low
level.
	   Viktor Chernov, a 44-year-old worker at a plant in Minsk, the
capital, is not terribly impressed.
	   With a salary of about 8 million rubles _ just dlrs 80 at the
black market rate, but still nearly double the official average
monthly wage _ he struggles to make ends meet.
	   ``I work from morning till dusk and I also work overtime, but in
front of a meat counter I'm starting to think what I can afford and
what not,'' Chernov said. ``Thank God, I've stocked up on mushrooms
from the forest and potatoes from my plot.''
	   ``I live better than they do in Russia and worse than in the
Baltics. And surely worse than my brother in San Francisco, who is
unemployed,'' he added.
	   Minsk, with its drab concrete buildings and huge squares, is
little changed from Soviet times. But tidy stores are well-stocked
with domestic food and some imported household wares. Staple goods
are sold at relatively cheap prices.
	   Wages are low, averaging about 4 million rubles (dlrs 40) a
month, but most people get their salaries and pensions on time,
unlike in Russia, where millions of workers get paid months late.
	   Lukashenko has been criticized by Western economists for his
Soviet-style policies, and by human rights groups for cracking down
on opponents. But he remains popular with many ordinary citizens.
	   He has advocated merging Belarus and its 10 million people with
Russia, which has almost 150 million people, and says Moscow could
learn a few things from his country.
	   ``We've done a lot here and it nowadays corresponds to what the
Russian government plans to do,'' Lukashenko said after a recent
meeting with Russia's new prime minister, Yevgeny Primakov.
	   Primakov ``spoke of a socially oriented economy of state
regulation of economic processes. I'm very glad that Russia is
looking a bit at its younger brother and is synchronizing some
processes with those happening today in Belarus,'' Lukashenko said.
	   Belarus allows only limited private enterprise and has attracted
little foreign investment. It remains heavily dependent on trade
with Russia, conducting much of that by barter.
	   Looking at the economic turmoil in Russia, First Deputy Economy
Minister Nikolai Zaichenko says his nation is better off.
	   ``We stand for supporting real producers, while Russia stood for
backing the financial sector,'' Zaichenko said in an interview.
``Which of the two evils is less bad? We think ours is the lesser
of the two.''
	   The Russian economic crisis did spark a brief panic in Belarus,
where anxious customers bought up everything from TV sets to
plastic buckets. The buying spree prompted the government to limit
the amount of basic foodstuffs that an individual can purchase.
	   Belarus also has curtailed food exports and told utility
companies to sharply cut heat and energy supplies.
	   Liberals like Alexander Potupa, vice president of the Belarusian
Union of Entrepreneurs, say the government has built a house of
cards by printing new money to patch budget holes and pay wages.
They also complain it stifles businesses and privatization efforts.
	   The government aims only to maintain living standards at roughly
the level they were during Soviet times, Potupa said.
	   Still, he said, Belarus' ``market socialism'' might survive for
years as a closed economy and it might yet prove attractive to the
fellow Slav nations of Russia and Ukraine.

	   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) _ Hundreds of pigeons whooshed into the
sky at the sudden crackle of gunshots and passersby caught in the
crossfire fell mortally wounded on Bogota's central square.
	   Mario Cruz dived to the ground with the young minister of
communications. After the first adrenaline rush, he remembered he
was supposed to be protecting this woman.
	   ``In that moment you're scared, of course, just like anyone
else,'' Cruz, still a government bodyguard, recalls of that
November 1985 morning. ``It's like your heart is going to burst.''
	   Sheltering himself behind a statue of Simon Bolivar, machine gun
in one hand, Cruz used the other to push down the head of the
minister, Noemi Sanin. Twenty minutes later, an armored car rescued
the two from the plaza.
	   The pair had stumbled into the start of an assault by leftist
rebels on the Supreme Court _ a two-day battle that claimed more
than 100 lives.
	   Such moments may come only once or twice in a career for the men
and women who've chosen to become government bodyguards in this
violent land where public servants are periodically targeted by
drug traffickers, leftist rebels, right-wing paramilitary groups
and other armed criminals. But it is a risky job. Over the past
decade, 113 of the protectors have died in the line of duty.
	   A bodyguard's life became less risky after December 1993,
however, when police caught up with and killed Pablo Escobar. The
Medellin drug lord had sent legions of assassins against
politicians and their ``guardaespaldas.'' In Spanish, the word
loosely translates to ``protects your back.''
	   Now, days once tense with danger are mostly exercises in tedium.
But fear still resides just below the surface.
	   ``Whoever says he's not scared, well, he's a liar,'' says the
muscular, graying Cruz, who has spent 19 of his 42 years protecting
lives for the Office of Administrative Security, the state agency
that guards presidents, Cabinet ministers, judges, lawmakers and
their families.
	   The agency employs 2,000 men and women as bodyguards, paying
them about one million pesos (dlrs 660) a month, with retirement
after 20 years for those who survive.
	   None has been killed this year, but a police officer working on
a bodyguard detail for the wife of former presidential candidate
Horacio Serpa was slain Sept. 14 by gunmen firing from a passing
taxi as he drank a soda outside a hospital.
	   At least officer Jesus Hernan Castillo, 32, did not fail Rosita
Serpa, the woman he protecting. That is a bodyguard's worst
nightmare.
	   Some never recover from the death of a comrade or _ worse _ of
someone they were supposed to protect.
	   ``You think, 'What did I do wrong?''' says Andres Carrillo, who
was one of Luis Carlos Galan's bodyguards when assassins killed the
charismatic presidential candidate in 1989. ``You feel like you're
going to burst. It's hard to breathe.''
	   Carrillo, 33, never even got a shot off at the attackers. He
also lost a bodyguard comrade, who shielded the candidate with his
body and died eight days later of gunshot wounds.
	   The Galan murder remains unsolved, but Carrillo is still on the
job, these days guarding a government minister. He refuses to
divulge a single detail about the person he accompanies throughout
Colombia.
	   Some bodyguards succumb to alcoholism or emotional strains so
severe they prompted the security agency to open a counseling
office.
	   But counselor Maria del Pilar Raquejo says it's difficult to get
the bodyguards to cooperate because so many consider psychological
counseling something ``for sissies.''
	   For Mario Cruz, the day begins at 5:30 a.m and he almost always
leaves home before his wife and two children awaken. Often, they
are already in bed when he returns home, sometimes after midnight.
	   The hours on duty are spent mostly sitting around waiting,
outside government buildings, in restaurants. Or else it's riding
around in cars with tinted windows, suspiciously eyeing passersby,
fingers tense on the grip of a gun.
	   Cruz doesn't wear a bullet-proof vest. But he doesn't go
anywhere without his 9 mm Beretta pistol. ``I love that weapon.
I've had it all my life.''
	   Weekends are almost never free, and the pay is half what he'd
make in the private sector.
	   But it's all worth it, says Cruz, a man from a poor farm family
who has spent years with some of Colombia's most important
officials.
	   ``Not everyone can be with a president, a minister,'' he says
proudly.

Parapsychology `healers' thriving in Iraq

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Sabah Kamadja repairs washing machines by
day. On three evenings a week, he treats the sick in a downtown
church with his supposedly special psychic powers.
	   On a recent night, Kamadja moved his hands slowly above the head
and stomach of a young woman on a bed. With his piercing blue eyes
squinting, he explained her problem to a visitor: ``She is losing
her hair.''
	   Kamadja is one of dozens of unlicensed healers who have surfaced
as Iraq's public health care has deteriorated and private care has
become too expensive for many. The new brand of practitioners call
themselves masters of electromagnetic fields or parapsychologists.
	   The phenomenon is debated in newspapers and on talk shows. The
weekly Alef-Ba ran a cartoon of a parapsychologist's office with a
sign saying ``paralooty'' _ ``looty'' is Iraqi slang for swindler.
A psychology professor even approached President Saddam Hussein to
urge the government step in to regulate the practice.
	   Ignoring critics who denounce the healers as quacks, Iraqis are
flocking to the ``blessed hands'' for relief from disorders ranging
from cancer and blindness to arthritis and acne.
	   The healers' reputations spread by word of mouth, often based on
outrageous claims. One story making the rounds claimed Queen Noor
of Jordan sent 15 blind men to one healer, himself blind, and he
cured them all.
	   Sometimes receiving up to 60 patients a day, the healers are
raking in bundles of money, but still charge less than conventional
doctors.
	   Regular clinics charge 2,000 dinars (dlrs 1.60) a visit _ half a
government employee's monthly salary. Pay scales have never been
adjusted to the deep depreciation of the dinar caused by U.N.
economic sanctions imposed on Iraq after its invasion of Kuwait
eight years ago.
	   Most of the healers take 1,000 dinars (80 cents) a session. And
no medicines are required. A very few, like Kamadja the washing
machine repairman, do not charge at all.
	   Another reason people are going to healers is that the regular
health system has collapsed. Iraq has blamed thousands of deaths on
shortages of medicine under the U.N. sanctions. The sanctions ban
the free export of oil, Iraq's most valuable commodity, and have
devastated the economy.
	   Al-Harith Hassan, a British-educated professor of psychology at
Baghdad University, calls the trend toward paranormal medicine
backward. He said he suggested to ``upper circles'' _ meaning
Saddam _ that the healers be regulated.
	   Hassan, who heads the Iraqi Parapsychologist Society, the only
such group in the Arab world, doesn't say all the healers are
fakes.
	   He wants their abilities to be tested and suggests those who are
found effective _ a very few, he believes _ be employed as aides in
state-run hospitals.
	   As it is, he said, the deteriorating economic situation has
created a market for people ``who abuse the simpletons who want to
get better.'' He said there are 400 healers practicing in Baghdad
alone.
	   Several healers said they detect a person's illness by using
their hands as scanners to sense a gap in the ``halo'' surrounding
everyone's body. Then, they say, they focus electromagnetic powers
to heal.
	   ``It is like charging a dead battery,'' said Dhafer Hussein, who
left accounting to open a healers' office in the middle-class area
of al-Doura. His card lists 10 ailments in which he specializes,
including migraines, ulcers and gland-related disorders.
	   Hussein said that after extensive reading on parapsychology, he
decided to try his hand at it and cured an uncle's gangrene. He
claims he has cured 1,000 people since.
	   One patient, who gave his name as Salem, swore his ulcer pains
disappeared after a few sessions with Hussein, who also recommended
the patient lighten up on spicy foods. A 23-year-old woman named
Warda said Hussein helped her regain partial sight after she was
blinded in an auto accident.
	   Hussein and Kamadja insist their work is scientific, unlike
traditional faith healers who use charms or readings from Islam's
Koran. Yet Hussein says he would not attempt to treat his three
children.
	   ``I send them to a doctor,'' he said. ``If I tried to heal them,
I might affect some symptoms so the doctor could get confused.''

Nippon Life, Germany's Deutsche Bank to form venture
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECAPS previous to UPDATE with confirmation of deal &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan's Nippon Life Insurance Co. and Deutsche Bank
AG, Germany's largest bank, have agreed to form a joint-venture
asset management company, a spokesman for the Japanese insurer said
Tuesday.
	   Nippon Life and Deutsche Bank will set up an investment-advisory
company in London next spring to handle asset management in Europe,
said Nippon Life's Seiji Shinmura.
	   Nippon Life, Japan's largest insurer, will take a two-thirds
capital position in the venture, with Deutsche Bank holding the
remaining one-third, he said.
	   The amount of capitalization and other details will be worked
out later, Shinmura added.
	   Under the venture, Nippon Life will establish a global network
for investment trust and asset management that will cover three
core markets across the world _ Japan, the United States and
Europe, reported the Yomiuri newspaper, Japan's largest.
	   Also, Nippon Life will increase its stake in Deutsche Bank's
Japanese trust-banking subsidiary to 10 percent, up from the
current 5 percent, Shinmura said.
	   In October, Nippon Life strengthened an alliance with Putnum
Investments, a major U.S. asset management company, to develop an
investment trust product line.
	   Nippon Life, established in 1889, is Japan's top insurer with
total assets of 42.2 trillion yen (dlrs 348.7 billion) as of March
1998, the Yomiuri said. It has 12,001 in-house staff and 63,850
salespeople.
	   Deutsche Bank, established in 1870, is headquartered in
Frankfurt. The bank is Germany's largest comprehensive financial
institution.

Wine boom in Japan a boon to foreign imports; California could do
</HEADLINE>
better &QL; 
 &UR; AP Photo planned &QL; 
 &UR; By CHRISTINE HANLEY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   FRESNO, California (AP) _ At the Lindbergh Cafe, a small,
unpretentious restaurant in Osaka, Japan, the wine list is full of
foreign labels, including dozens from California.
	   Tokyo's bustling New York Grill, which boasts 100 varieties
exclusively from California, struggles to keep the cellar full.
	   ``We would like more,'' said assistant manager Takuji Namiki.
``A lot more.''
	   From tiny cafes to big hotel restaurants, on store shelves and
kitchen tables, wine is becoming a drink of choice among the
Japanese, and demand for imports has never been higher.
	   California's vineyards, which supply nearly all U.S. wine
exports, are shipping more of their products than ever to Japan,
with volume nearly doubling over the past year. And there's room
for more: The United States is only the fourth-leading supplier of
wine to Japan, with about a 7 percent market share, behind France,
Italy and Chile.
	   ``We've seen unprecedented growth in Japan,'' said Gladys
Horiuchi, a spokeswoman for the California Wine Institute, a trade
group based in San Francisco.
	   Wine consumption in Japan was up 25 percent last year, said
Patrick Bray, director of business development for the Japan
External Trade Organization in California.
	   Still, the state could do better in comparison to its rivals,
Bray said. ``We're not losing volume, we're losing market share.''
	   Sung Won Sohn, an economist for Wells Fargo Bank who tracks
Asian markets, said the economic setbacks in Japan make it a good
time to promote California wines.
	   ``California wine has not always been less expensive than
European wines because of the strong dollar,'' he said. ``This may
be an opportunity to gain market share in Japan.''
	   The wine boom dates back about a year, when a Japanese news
program publicized reports touting the health benefits of wine.
Distributors were emptied out.
	   ``Practically every importer ran out of red wine,'' said Gregor
Prattley, marketing coordinator for wines and champagne at Jardine
Wines and Spirits K.K., a leading importer.
	   Demand has held steady despite the economic turmoil that has
hurt other U.S. exports to the Pacific rim, including rice, cotton
and cattle.
	   Industry representatives, trade analysts and others in the wine
business say a lot of factors are behind the boom _ a leading one
being simply all the room for growth.
	   Japan remains far down on the per capita consumption list, with
residents drinking an average of about a liter _ or a little more
than a bottle _ each year. Americans, by comparison, consume an
average of seven liters a year.
	   Some attribute it to the French paradox, a term coined when
reports in the early 1990s suggested the French have lower rates of
heart disease because they drink wine.
	   Others credit the Westernization of diets and culture, with
younger generations opting for other alcoholic drinks besides the
traditional beer, whiskey and sake, a rice-based wine.
	   ``We've been telling them for 10 years to drink wine, and it's
finally starting to become part of the cultural fabric, part of
their daily life,'' said Steve Sarle, international sales director
for Sutter Home.
	   Some point to an educational system that includes hundreds of
wine schools, where more students are being trained as sommeliers,
versed in the art of matching wines with meals.
	   Pop culture also reflects the trend. Since last month, Goro
Inagaki, one of Japan's most popular actors, has been playing the
lead role of a wine genius in a new fall series, ``Sommelier.''
	   Most of the growth has been among wines selling for dlrs 8 to
dlrs 13 in America, about the average starting price for imports.
And major specialized vendors and discount stores have made wine
more affordable in Japan.
	   So far, no particular California brand seems to be standing out
as a best-seller, although many of the state's popular varieties
are doing their best export business in Japan. Sutter Home, for
example, expects to ship 40,000 cases by the end of this year, up
from 18,000 in 1997, Sarle said.
	   About half the California demand is for red wine, 40 percent for
white and 10 percent blush, according to Kenichi Hori, who runs the
Wine Institute's Tokyo office.
	   ``The most popular is Cabernet Sauvignon. We also have
significant demand for Pinot Noir,'' he said. ``Among whites,
Chardonnay is the most popular.''

	   PARIS (AP) _ It was supposed to be a quick war, and a ``war to
end all wars,'' but of course it wasn't. It was a four-year
nightmare of unimaginable brutality, one that killed millions and
changed Europe forever.
	   On Wednesday, Britain's queen and France's president preside
over an occasion both grand and poignant _ the last major
anniversary of the Great War likely to include actual veterans of
the carnage.
	   Precious few are still alive who fought in World War I. And yet
fascination with the conflict remains, evident in the countless
grainy, black-and-white photos gracing newspaper and magazine
covers in France and Britain as the anniversary approached.
	   The 80th anniversary of when the guns fell silent _ at the 11th
hour of the 11th day of the 11th month of 1918 _ was being marked
with pomp and ceremony at the grandest military site in Paris:
Napoleon's Arc de Triomphe.
	   At 11 a.m., in front of a few remaining survivors, Queen
Elizabeth II and French President Jacques Chirac were to place a
wreath at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier under the arch.
	   They were to place another wreath at a statue of Georges
Clemenceau, France's deeply respected World War I leader.
	   There were echoes of World War II as well: the queen planned to
unveil a statue of Sir Winston Churchill, on an avenue renamed the
Avenue Winston Churchill.
	   Later in the day, the queen was to travel to Ypres in Belgium,
where she was joining Belgian King Albert II in remembering the
appalling losses from a four-year war of attrition against the
Germans in the trenches there.
	   There was one major figure missing from the ceremonies:
Germany's new leader, chancellor-elect Gerhard Schroeder, who
informed Chirac he could not attend because his calendar was
already full with creating a new government.
	   Schroeder dismissed as ``rubbish'' reports that he wasn't
attending because he wanted to avoid the past.
	   The Great War killed 13 million civilians and 8.5 million
fighting men. Germany lost an estimated 1.7 million soldiers;
Britain lost more than 900,000; Italy 650,000; the United States
116,000. France was proportionally the hardest hit, with 1.3
million dead.
	   The sheer devastation wrought on France can partly be measured
by the 30,000 or so monuments in cities, towns and villages across
the nation. Some villages list more war dead than their current
populations.
	   As if there were any doubt about the enduring wound left by the
war, a bitter dispute broke out between the political right and
left just days before the anniversary.
	   Socialist Prime Minister Lionel Jospin, visiting the site of a
suicidal offensive against the Germans at Chemin des Dames, asked
that 49 mutineers executed ``as an example'' be ``fully
reintegrated today into our national collective memory.''
	   Chirac, a rightist, called Jospin's remarks ``inopportune.'' And
a political ally of the president's, former Interior Minister
Jean-Louis Debre, said Jospin's remarks were ``of a nature to
justify acts of mutiny in the future.''
	   The same debate has taken place in Britain, where last week,
some 306 men executed for cowardice or desertion were not included
in a memorial led by the queen.
	   Many are believed now to have been suffering from post-traumatic
stress disorder after enduring the horrors of the trenches for
months.

Shooting erupts in Albanian city after arrests
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TIRANA, Albania (AP) _ A crowd fired shots in the air in an
Albanian city and looted a building during a protest of several
arrests, the state news agency ATA reported.
	   The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe said its
office in Shkodra, 50 miles (80 kilometers) north of Tirana, had
been looted of computers and other equipment. No one was hurt, the
OSCE said. By late Tuesday, some armed men had gained entry into
the main local government building, state television said.
	   The situation grew calmer later, and the protesters cleared the
streets and vacated the government building.
	   The unrest began after three men were arrested after reportedly
walking toward President Rexhep Mejdani a week earlier carrying
weapons.
	   A police source originally said the men were charged with trying
to assassinate Mejdani. But the interior ministry later said the
men had been arrested on suspicion of theft. Two were later
released, but a third remained in custody late Tuesday.
	   Protesters said they would take to the streets again if the
third man wasn't released.
	   Shkodra is a stronghold of former President Sali Berisha, who
was voted out of office after months of turmoil last year. He now
leads the opposition party in Europe's poorest country.

Pepito Figueroa, famous Puerto Rican violinist and teacher, dies at
</HEADLINE>
93 &QL; 
 &UR; By MANUEL ERNESTO RIVERA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) _ Jose ``Pepito'' Figueroa, the
famous Puerto Rican violinist whose 80-year career took him from
rural Puerto Rico to the Spanish royal palace, died at age 93.
	   Family members said he died Monday in San Juan of heart attacks
suffered after he fell and broke a hip last week.
	   On Tuesday, a parade of musicians, artists and other cultural
luminaries mingled with Figueroa's former violin students before
the open casket that was displayed at the Institute of Puerto Rican
Culture and the Puerto Rico Conservatory of Music.
	   Figueroa was born in 1905 in the northwest mountain town of San
Sebastian, the first son of Jesus Figueroa and Carmen Sanabria. He
began playing the violin at age 7, won his first music contest in
1914 at age 12, and toured Mexico and Cuba the same year with
violinist Henri Ern, who was then director of the Cincinnati
Conservatory of Music.
	   In 1923, Figueroa was accepted into the Royal Conservatory in
Madrid, where he was named concertmaster of the orchestra and won
the school's Sarasate Prize.
	   He performed in Madrid's Royal Palace for members of the Spanish
royal family and later enrolled in the Normal School of Music in
Paris, where he received his Concert License from Jacques Thibaud
with the highest grade ever given in the school. He was first
violin in the school's string quartet.
	   Over the next 70 years, he taught and performed with a string of
musical groups _ so many that even family members are unsure of the
dates.
	   Figueroa was named violin professor for the Symphonic Orchestra
of Paris and played under the direction of Pierre Monteaux, Charles
Muench and others.
	   He made his debut in the mainland United States at New York's
Carnegie Hall in 1934. Later, he became concertmaster of the
American Arts Orchestra under director Karl Krueger and of the
National Symphony Orchestra in Washington under director Hans
Kindler.
	   He was first violin of the American String Quartet in New York,
performed as a soloist in the Symphonic Orchestra of Puerto Rico
and participated in many Casals Festivals in Puerto Rico.
	   Figueroa was named Doctor Honoris Causa of the Puerto Rico
Conservatory of Music, where he taught violin until his death.

Rios, Kuerten win in first round of Chevrolet Cup
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) _ Top-seeded Marcelo Rios of Chile, still
in the race for the No. 1 ranking on the ATP tour, on Tuesday
defeated Marcio Carlsson of Brazil 6-2, 1-6, 6-2 in the first round
of the dlrs 315,000 Chevrolet Cup tennis tournament.
	   The second-ranked Rios, cheered by a highly partisan crowd,
appeared on his way to an easy victory after the first set, but was
clearly surprised by Carlsson's play in the second one.
	   In the final set, Rios broke Carlsson's service twice and won
the final point with his sixth ace of the match.
	   Rios, seeking his first title in his hometown tournament after
reaching the finals in the last three years, is 605 points behind
top-ranked Pete Sampras in the rankings. The Santiago tournament
awards 150 points to the champion.
	   Fourth-seeded Gustavo Kuerten of Brazil, the 1996 French Open
champion, had 11 aces in 6-7 (5-7), 6-4, 7-5 victory over Luis
Morejon of Ecuador.
	   In other matches, Felix Mantilla of Spain breezed past Mariano
Zabaleta of Argentina 6-2, 6-3; Francisco Clavet of Spain defeated
Ramon Delgado of Paraguay 6-4, 6-4; Martin Rodriguez of Paraguay
beat Guillermo Canas of Argentina 3-6, 6-3, 7-6 (9-7) and Mariano
Puerta of Argentina beat Fernando Vicente of Spain 2-6, 7-6 (7-2),
6-3, 7-2.
	   Julian Alonso of Spain led 5-2 in the first set when countryman
Juan Viloca, withdrew due to injury.

	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ Australian survivors of World War I
were guests of honor at official ceremonies held across the country
Tuesday to mark the conflict's end 80 years ago.
	   At the main ceremony in the national capital, Prime Minister
John Howard and Governor-General Sir William Deane were among those
who honored Australia's war dead and met six veterans of the
battlefields of the Great War, as it is also known.
	   More than 330,000 Australian men served overseas during the
1914-18 war and more than 61,000 were killed. Drawn from a
population of 4.8 million people, Australia had the highest per
capita death toll of any country involved.
	   Just 66 veterans of the war are still alive, according to the
Department of Veterans Affairs.
	   Remembrance ceremonies were held at cenotaph's and monuments in
all Australian capitals and in hundreds of country towns from which
many of the fighting men were drawn.
	   About 2,000 people gathered at the Australian War Memorial in
Canberra at 11 a.m. (0000 GMT) on the 11th day of the 11th month:
Armistice Day.
	   Six veterans _ Ted Smout, Howard Pope, Eric Abraham, Angus
Clark, August Brand, and Mick Holingsworth, all aged 100 years or
older _ were met by Howard and Deane, Queen Elizabeth II's
representative and Australia's titular head of state.
	   Howard and Deane laid wreaths at the Stone of Remembrance
following a commemorative address by the French Ambassador to
Australia, Dominique Girard.

Shooting of soldiers could deal new blow to peace deal

	   OTNIEL, West Bank (AP) _ One Israeli soldier was shot and
another wounded in an apparent ambush by Palestinian militants who
hid by the side of a West Bank road and opened fire on the white
military truck as it stopped at an intersection.
	   The Tuesday night shooting occurred only hours after Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced he had received new
assurances from Yasser Arafat's Palestinian Authority that it would
take necessary steps to fight militant groups. As a result,
Netanyahu said he would take the Mideast land-for-peace accord to
his Cabinet Wednesday after two weeks of delay.
	   The meeting was scheduled for noon, (10:00 GMT) but it was not
clear whether it would go forward as planned due to the attack.
Netanyahu suspended a Cabinet session over the new accord after a
suicide bombing in a Jerusalem market Friday which injured 21.
	   A senior adviser to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the
government was waiting for more details before it could assess how
the incident may affect the peace process.
	   Tuesday's attack occurred around 11:20 p.m. in the middle of an
undivided highway near a West Bank crossing near the city of
Hebron. The Jewish settlement of Otniel is about 1.6 kilometers (1
mile) east of the junction.
	   Soldiers who arrived at the scene said they believed the
assailants headed on foot for Palestinian-controlled territory a
few kilometers (miles) up the road, the Israeli army said in a
statement.
	   The rear doors of the victims' white truck were riddled with
bullets and the back and side windows were shattered. The Army said
the soldiers managed to fire back at the shooters.
	   The two victims, aged 21 and 23, were brought to Soroka hospital
in Beersheba. Hospital spokeswoman Batya Kuris said one man was in
serious condition with a chest-wound. The other had small fragments
of glass in his head and his wounds were considered mild.
	   ``We were sitting watching the municipal election results on
television when there were some very loud bursts of fire. It
sounded like an entire clip of ammunition,'' Yehuda Glick, a
resident of Otniel, told Israel's army radio.
	   Asked if the incident would affect the Cabinet meeting,
Netanyahu's adviser, David Bar-Illan told The Associated Press,
``It depends very much on the actions of the Palestinian Authority,
what they do in response and what they've done until now to prevent
such actions.''
	   ``When the picture is clearer we'll know from what's happened
whether they have been lax or whether they are doing whatever can
be expected of any police force,'' Bar-Illan said.
	   A Palestinian security official, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said Palestinian security chiefs were in contact with
their Israeli counterparts and cooperating over the incident.
Palestinian police set-up roadblocks around Hebron and searched
cars.
	   The Israeli army said findings of its initial investigation were
given to the Palestinian police.
	   Since the two sides began talking again in late October after 18
months of stalemate, there have been a spate of attacks against
Israelis by groups aiming to derail the peace process. Last Friday,
the militant group Islamic Jihad carried out a suicide bombing in a
Jerusalem market, wounding 21.
	   Several days earlier a suicide bomber tried to ram his
explosives-laden car into a school bus carrying Israeli children in
the Gaza Strip. One soldier was killed protecting the children.
	   Nertanyahu has said he would not hand-over more land to
Palestinians control if would be used as a safe haven for
terrorists. He has consistently insisted that the Palestinians do
more to fight militants. Under the latest accord, Israel is to
withdraw from 13 percent of the West Bank over 12 weeks in exchange
for a Palestinian anti-terror campaign.
	   If the Cabinet ratifies the agreement Wednesday, Israel might
still be able to meet its first commitment on Nov. 16, an initial
troop pullback from 2 percent of the West Bank.

Bayern Munich's rise and Moenchengladbach's fall
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ROY KAMMERER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BERLIN (AP) _ Borussia Moenchengladbach against Bayern Munich
used to be a battle between two legendary clubs that divided up the
Bundesliga each year, then strolled out and captured a European
Cup.
	   The two clubs snatched up five European trophies in the 1970s
and eight Bundesliga titles while fielding the likes of Franz
Beckenbauer, Gerd Mueller, Jupp Heynckes and Guenter Netzer.
	   When those German legends weren't tackling each other, they
joined sides to win Germany the 1974 World Cup.
	   This year, once again, the great rivals are Bundesliga standouts
_ with the twist that one legendary club is burning up the league
and the second disintegrating so spectacularly the country's fans
are spellbound by the show.
	   First-place Munich, galloping away from rivals, hopes this is
the side that can conquer Europe again after a long drought.
Moenchengladbach is dead last, lost in a dramatic freefall that has
left its former stars in despair.
	   ``I believe if Moenchengladbach is demoted, then the club will
disappear for a long long time into oblivion,'' said Netzer, now a
respected television commentator.
	   Moenchengladbach was blasted 8-2 by Leverkusen last week in one
of the worst blowouts in Bundesliga history. On Saturday, as
disbelieving fans produced high TV ratings, VfL Wolfsburg
humiliated the once-proud side again 7-1.
	   ``The hearts of soccer fans are bleeding,'' wrote Bild, the
country's largest-circulation daily. ``Borussia, perhaps the most
brutal demise in the history of the Bundesliga.''
	   Munich's rise appears easy to explain. Europe's fourth most
profitable club in some surveys, the Bavarian team has for years
been well-managed under Beckenbauer as chairman and former player
and now business manager Uli Hoeness.
	   This season, Munich has roared to the fastest start in
Bundesliga history, outscored opponents 30-to-10 and run away from
the league in a down year for most of its rivals. The club also
remains in contention for a quarterfinal berth in the Champions
Cup.
	   Many believe the arrival of dour-faced but diplomatic coach
Ottmar Hitzfeld explains Munich's success. He appears on his way to
welding a smooth ensemble from players like Brazilian striker
Giovane Elber, fiery defender Jens Jeremies and eccentric
midfielder Mario Basler.
	   Hitzfeld has already proven he can challenge Europe's best with
a good German club. Two years ago, he led Borussia Dortmund to an
unexpected Champions Cup trophy.
	   ``I'm enthusiastic about him. We're all enthusiastic about
him,'' said Munich midfielder Mehmet Scholl.
	   Moenchengladbach's rapid demise, just four years after winning
the German Cup, is more mysterious.
	   Netzer has blasted the club president, board and manager Rolf
Ruessman for incompetence, calling the group a ``province posse.''
	   But while Munich has benefited from having one-time greats like
Beckenbauer, Hoeness and Mueller return and lead the club,
Moenchengladbach's stars chose to depart for greener pastures.
	   Neither Netzer, former defender and German national team coach
Berti Vogts, or Heynckes are around to lend their prestige and
know-how to the small-town club they made famous.
	   ``Certainly, everything that's been messed up can't be fixed
with a push of a button, but the goal has to be to win Jupp
Heynckes as coach,'' said Netzer of his former teammate, who led
Real Madrid to the Champions Cup triumph last season before being
fired.
	   ``But Heynckes won't do it,'' added Netzer.
	   On Tuesday, the club fired coach Friedel Rausch and parted
company with Ruessman. It also dug into its past when it named
Rainer Bonhof new coach. Bonhof, a former Borussia star, won the
the 1974 World Cup with Germany, but he doesn't have the stature of
a Netzer or Heynckes.
	   Munich and Moenchengladbach were set to play Tuesday, before a
muddy field led to the match being rescheduled.
	   The prospects made some in Germany shudder, who believed that if
Leverkusen and Wolfsburg could trounce Moenchengladbach by a
combined 15-3, then the sight of Munich demolishing its old rival
could be ugly.
	   ``Will Munich score 20?'' wrote the alarmed Berlin daily, B.Z.

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Banished deputy prime minister
Anwar Ibrahim will be hidden away in a dark jail cell when 20
Pacific Rim leaders come to town next week.
	   But Anwar, on trial for abuse of power and sexual misconduct,
will still manage to cast a long shadow over the Asia-Pacific
Economic Cooperation summit.
	   When Anwar appeared at his arraignment Sept. 29 with a black eye
and bruises from the hands of police, there was an outcry against
the Southeast Asian government.
	   U.S. President Bill Clinton and Canadian Prime Minister Jean
Chretien, angered by Anwar's treatment, intend to snub Malaysian
Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad by not meeting with him privately
during the summit next Tuesday and Wednesday.
	   The presidents of Indonesia and the Philippines, traditionally
close friends of Malaysia, threatened to boycott the 6th annual
trade forum. They have since agreed to come, but may raise the
Anwar issue.
	   A spokesman for Japanese Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi said
Tuesday that he would pay a courtesy call on his Malaysian
counterpart.
	   ``What is happening in Malaysia is a domestic issue and no
foreign leader has a right to intervene in a domestic matter,''
said spokesman Akitaka Saiki.
	   Australian Foreign Minister Alexander Downer said the Anwar case
wouldn't derail the trade summit, but would be on everyone's mind.
	   ``You can't ignore the fact that what is happening in Malaysia
is a significant issue ... of great interest to the Asia-Pacific
region,'' Downer said last week. ``Every government in the region
is devoting a bit of time to seeing how this issue in Malaysia is
going to unfold.''
	   How it will unfold is anyone's guess.
	   The capital has been calm since the last of dozens of
anti-government rallies turned into a riot on Oct. 24, complete
with tear gas and stone-throwing protesters.
	   The Malaysian government is taking no chances.
	   Authorities said 5,700 riot police would be on call to prevent
potential protests from reaching the summit site on the outskirts
of Kuala Lumpur. All the leaders will be driven around in
bulletproof cars as a precaution.
	   Tian Chua, an Anwar supporter and chairman of a new coalition of
23 reform groups and five opposition parties, would not speculate
on APEC protest plans.
	   ``Definitely there will be some things going on. We will have to
wait and see,'' Tian said, adding that the security measures were
overkill. ``It's just projecting to the international community the
image that we really are a police state.''
	   The scrappy Mahathir, 72, has survived many political crises
during his 17-year grip on power and has never cared much about
image.
	   After he sacked Anwar as his deputy and finance minister Sept.
2, he stunned people by announcing he had conducted his own
investigation into the sex allegations and concluded they were
true. Anwar committed sodomy _ a crime in this predominantly Muslim
nation -- had tried to cover it up by using his influence over
police, and was morally unfit to lead the country as his handpicked
successor, Mahathir said.
	   Anwar, who has called Mahathir ``drunk with power,'' has
fiercely denied the five charges of abuse of power and five counts
of illicit sex. He says they were cooked up because his calls for
government transparency and political reforms posed a threat to
Mahathir and his cronies.
	   Anwar's dramatic trial will adjourn this weekend and will only
resume after the APEC summit.
	   Mahathir, long a champion of the Asian Third World underdog and
no friend to Western financial institutions, has never been too
keen on APEC.
	   He boycotted the first summit in 1993, objecting to APEC's
inclusion of large Western economies, such as the United States,
Canada, Australian and New Zealand. He proposed an alternative East
Asian-only economic group, an idea that had little appeal among
other Pacific nations.
	   Taking advantage of his role as host, Mahathir will likely try
to steer APEC debate away from free trade and toward measures to
control the Asian financial crisis.
	   He also is expected to discuss measures to rein in foreign
currency speculators, his most nagging pet peeve.
	   Malaysia imposed sweeping capital controls in September to curb
flows of speculative money and peg the Malaysian currency to 3.80
ringgit to the dollar, flying in the face of International Monetary
Fund orthodoxy.
	   The United States and Australia want to keep free trade as the
basis for the APEC forum and will be pushing a plan to lift trade
barriers in APEC countries in nine industries.
	   APEC's aim is free trade among the developed member nations by
2010 and developing countries by 2020.
	   Malaysia's trade minister Rafidah Aziz said Tuesday she hoped
the visiting leaders would be courteous enough not to ask Mahathir
about the Anwar case.
	   ``I can't imagine us going to Washington and somebody asking
President Clinton, `How is Monica?'''

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Some are villagers who turned to
guns after years of Serbian repression. Others are crisply trained
professionals on a military mission with a political goal: creation
of a greater Albania.
	   The Kosovo Liberation Army is united in seeking independence
from Serbia, but the diversity of its fighters and the apparent
lack of a single commanding figure add unpredictability to Kosovo's
simmering conflict.
	   What is clear is that, despite continued efforts by Western
powers, the rebels show no sign of compromising or dropping their
hard-line stance.
	   In KLA strongholds across Kosovo, guerrillas carrying automatic
rifles and grenade launchers reject any notion that diplomacy has
brought improvements for ethnic Albanians.
	   ``We think it's not going to change for us,'' KLA officer Ramush
Haradinaj, 30, said about the rebels' view of the prospects for
stability in Kosovo villages.
	   Western powers led by the United States have forced a de facto
cease-fire on the province in Serbia, the main Yugoslav republic,
and now push for political negotiations that would restore
self-rule for the ethnic Albanian majority.
	   But the West rejects the KLA goal of independence, and fears are
growing that the ethnic Albanian guerrilla movement could split
into radical and moderate camps over how to proceed.
	   That would further increase the sporadic violence continuing in
Kosovo, some of it instigated by the rebels.
	   ``If the KLA splits, then we won't have a political solution,''
said Belul Beqaj, a political analyst and freelance journalist. He
summed up the rebel problem: ``There's no one clearly in charge.''
	   Financed by money from the ethnic Albanian community at home and
abroad, the KLA began as a mostly ragtag movement using second-hand
small arms from Albania.
	   It gradually assumed control of areas of the Kosovo countryside,
prompting Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic to launch a
crackdown in February that brought heavy fighting to the province.
	   Milosevic's superior forces eventually routed the rebels and
were close to decimating all KLA strongholds when the West
threatened NATO airstrikes to force Milosevic to make withdrawals
last month and pledge to restore the self-rule he stripped in 1989.
	   Heavy fighting ended, but hit-and-run attacks and other forms of
low-level violence have continued. Both sides accuse the other of
shooting first.
	   KLA spokesman Adem Demaci said Tuesday the rebels would defend
villages against attacks by Serb police but would refrain from
opening fire first.
	   A former political prisoner who wears thick glasses, Demaci is
the closest thing to a top KLA authority. He signs accreditation
passes for journalists wishing to work in KLA strongholds, and some
of the guerrillas in the field refer to Demaci as the rebel
strategist.
	   But asked Tuesday if the KLA claimed responsibility for the
killings of two Serb policemen whose bodies were found the day
before, Demaci said he lacked the authority to comment on such a
matter.
	   In the field, the KLA presents contrasting images. At a recent
funeral for a guerrilla killed by a mine, scores of fighters in
green camouflage marched in formation, one wearing a Chicago White
Sox baseball cap with a KLA patch sewn on the front.
	   In Sipitula village outside the provincial capital of Pristina,
a KLA figure who gave his name as Imeri provided the group's
political line.
	   ``For nine years we've been trying for a peaceful solution.
We've learned with the Serbs, you can't do that,'' he said over
coffee as a few automatic weapons bursts sounded outside.
	   U.S. envoy Christopher Hill is trying to get the ethnic
Albanians to accept a three-year interim period of restored
self-rule, followed by further negotiations. The KLA is studying
Hill's proposal, Demaci said, but he warned that even if a deal
gets worked out, problems could continue among the ethnic Albanian
community.
	   A hint of what could happen came from Imeri, the KLA figure in
Sipitula, when asked about reports that the KLA killed two ethnic
Albanians for urging villagers to turn in their weapons, as
requested by Serb police.
	   ``If that is true, if they executed the right guys for giving
propaganda about handing in guns, they did the right thing,'' he
said. ``Everywhere in the world, traitors are executed.''

Mir cosmonauts deploy `meteorite trap' during spacewalk
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Two Russian cosmonauts on the Mir space station
successfully deployed a French-made device for catching and
studying small meteorite particles during a six-hour spacewalk that
ended early Wednesday.
	   Cosmonauts Gennady Padalka and Sergei Avdeyev installed the
``meteorite trap,'' which should collect data on a barrage of
particles expected to peak around the Mir in mid-November, said
Valery Lyndin, spokesman for mission control.
	   The device will stay attached to the Mir until 1999, when it
will be taken back to earth for analysis by a French astronaut who
will fly to the station early next year.
	   The ``meteorite rain'' doesn't pose a serious threat to the Mir
because it consists of tiny remnants, not full meteorites. To be
safe, however, the two cosmonauts will board the Soyuz escape
capsule when the shower reaches its peak.
	   At the start of the spacewalk, Padalka and Avdeyev released a
satellite model made by schoolchildren from several countries.
	   ``Toss it gently toward the moon,'' Padalka told Avdeyev.
	   The two also mounted other scientific hardware on the outside of
the 12-year-old Mir.
	   In all, the two cosmonauts completed nine of 10 operations they
set out to handle, said Lyndin. The spacewalk lasted just under six
hours and ended at 4:17 a.m. (0117 GMT) Wednesday, Lyndin said.
	   It was this crew's second spacewalk. The first was in August.

Court will decide on extradition of suspected kidnapper to Italy
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ A hearing will begin later this month
to decide whether to extradite a man to Italy on kidnapping
charges, a magistrate said Wednesday.
	   Australian officials arrested the man at Sydney's airport on
Aug. 15 on currency charges after finding a large amount of
undeclared cash in his bags.
	   The name on the passport on which he was traveling was Luigi
Valiante, but a previous court hearing was told Italian authorities
had identified the man from fingerprints as Giovanni Farina, 48,
wanted in Italy on kidnapping and firearms charges.
	   He appeared in Sydney's Central Local Court on Wednesday charged
in both names, accused of failing to declare currency in excess of
Australian dollars 5,000 (U.S. dlrs 3,000), escaping from lawful
custody and assaulting Australian Federal Police.
	   Italian authorities have requested he be extradited on
kidnapping charges.
	   Farina is accused of masterminding the kidnappings of wealthy
business people whose ears were chopped off when ransom money was
not paid in time.
	   In one attack, Giuseppe Soffiantini's ears were cut off and sent
to a television station before his family paid the ransom.
	   Prosecutor Penelope Musgrave said Australian Attorney-General
Daryl Williams had signed extradition papers, but they had not yet
been served on the man.
	   Magistrate Alan Moore remanded him in custody to appear at an
extradition hearing on Nov. 25.
	   The man has not entered a plea.

Report: Japan to announce fishing, forestry aid to Asia at APEC
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan will give 25 billion yen (dlrs 204 million)
to Asian nations to help develop their fishing and forestry
industries, a major Japanese daily reported Wednesday.
	   The Foreign Ministry declined comment on the report in the Asahi
newspaper.
	   The aid, promised for the next five years, will be announced at
a Nov. 14 meeting of representatives from Pacific Rim economies
ahead of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit Nov. 17-18 in
Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, the Asahi said.
	   Japan is opposed to tariff cuts in fish and forestry products,
which are expected to be discussed at APEC.
	   The aid offer is aimed at trying to gain understanding from Asia
on Japan's position that technical assistance and other help to
develop industries are more crucial than tariff reduction to wrest
the region out of its current economic crisis, the Asahi said.
	   Japan's resistance to reducing tariff cuts in the two sectors
has been criticized as a bad example by some APEC members. Free
trade is the main issue for the 21-member group.

In the shadow of the Andes: Solar energy ends long nights

<TEXT>
	   MENDOZA, Argentina (AP) _ Wrinkled beyond her years by the sun,
Leonizia Felipa Gimenez still uses a metal box full of burning
coals to iron her clothes. But the 60-year-old widow of an Andes
goat herder has put away her smoky candles for good.
	   And she doesn't really need the antique iron any longer, thanks
to a solar panel mounted on her home through a local government
program.
	   ``I now have really bright light in my home at night. I don't
have a television but I can play with my grandchild and stay up
later,'' exclaimed Gimenez, a mother of 11.
	   The government mounted a 5-foot (1.5-meter) solar panel on the
roof of her home, and that of scores of others in the foothills of
the Andes, providing a cheap, clean electrical source.
	   Experts contend solar, wind and other alternative energy sources
will help reduce reliance on fossil fuels, which release
heat-trapping gases blamed by scientists for a gradual warming of
the planet.
	   The popularity of these alternatives is increasing as countries
look to trim their pollutant output in accordance with a 1997
landmark treaty signed in Kyoto, Japan.
	   Gimenez says her life is better because of solar energy, one of
the clean energies talked about by representatives of 160 nations
attending a global warming meeting in the Argentine capital.
	   Instead of heading to bed at sundown, lulled to sleep by
bleating goats on this rough grazing land, she now can stay up with
friends and family in her house in Cacheuta Sur, 35 miles (55 kms)
outside Mendoza, in western Argentina.
	   And if she could afford a radio, Gimenez could listen to tango,
drawing power from a car battery charged by the solar panel set
atop the humble, whitewashed wooden building she calls home.
	   In these remote and rocky hills far removed from power company
lines, solar energy may be the only option other than candles or
kerosene lamps.
	   Both in the developing and developed world, solar power is being
used in ways unheard of since it first gained attention in the
1970s during the U.S. energy crisis.
	   In Buenos Aires, Charles W. Linderman of the Washington-based
Edison Electric Institute says that more than half of U.S.
electrical generation still derives from burning gas, coal or oil.
	   He notes that only about 1 percent of all electricity generated
in the United States is solar.
	   But nations are increasingly looking to alternatives as they
press to implement the 1997 Kyoto treaty, which calls for a
curtailing of greenhouse gas emissions by 2010.
	   ``In some cases it becomes the way to electrify a village that
doesn't have electricity,'' Linderman said.
	   Solar panels are finding such uses in the industrialized world
in public schools and buildings.
	   A solar newsletter, The UPVG Record, even reports that solar
power is used to dry coffee beans, zap bugs, purify water and run
two-passenger ferries on Lake Geneva, Switzerland.
	   Acceptance of renewable energy sources such as wind power and
fuel from biomass _ trees and plants that don't release greenhouse
gases _ also is rising, environmentalists say.
	   ``Worldwide, these account for 8-9 percent of the world's energy
supplies. We believe it would be easy to quadruple that in the next
50 years,'' said Wim Kersten of Friends of the Earth International,
a 50-nation environmental coalition based in London.
	   Carlos Gallardo, a government official who installs the solar
panels in Cacheuta Sur, said it costs an eligible family about dlrs
200 to get solar power installed. That's a relatively inexpensive
option for the region's goat herders and cattle shepherds, most of
whom make about dlrs 1000 a year.
	   It's nice that solar energy reduces global warming, but the
improved lives of people who live in Gimenez's community is what
counts most, Gallardo said.
	   Gimenez agrees. ``Before when we didn't have light, it was much
more sad,'' she said. ``We had candles but they never lasted. We
would have go to bed soon after the sun.''

	   ATOYAC DE ALVAREZ, Mexico (AP) _ Ten armed and masked men
attacked a police station and government store in the southwestern
state of Guerrero on Tuesday, officials said. Two of the attackers
and one policeman were killed in the resulting shootout.
	   The state government said the attackers apparently belonged to
the leftist rebel Popular Revolutionary Army that first appeared
near here in 1996.
	   Police said the attackers arrived in a stolen truck, which they
used to carry away three wounded comrades after a battle involving
Kalashnikov rifles and firebombs. Four police officers also were
injured.
	   Army helicopters joined troops and police in searching for the
attackers who fled the ambush in the village of San Juan de Flores
in the Atoyac district, about 45 miles (70 kilometers) northwest of
Acapulco.
	   Police said they found 900 spent Kalashnikov shells after the
attack.
	   About 50 people have died in clashes between authorities and the
rebel group known as the EPR or its offshoots since it appeared in
June 1996.
	   The EPR is not affiliated with the Zapatista National Liberation
Army that rose in the southernmost state of Chiapas in 1994.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) _ Brazil's navy rescued 20 crew
members from a British container ship after it caught fire off the
coast of northeastern Brazil, officials said Tuesday.
	   Five naval boats rescued the crew as 30-foot (nine-meter) flames
started to sweep through the vessel Monday afternoon, port official
Jose Umberto Santana said. No one was injured.
	   It was not clear what the ship was carrying or what caused the
fire.
	   The ship, Harmony, went up in flames 75 miles (120 kilometers)
east of Porto Seguro, a town about 500 miles (800 kilometers)
northeast of Rio de Janeiro, Santana said. Later, explosions ripped
through the ship and it continued to burn late Tuesday.
	   The British ship had left Rio de Janeiro and was bound for
Venezuela, Brazilian navy operations worker Roberto Rodrigues said.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   ACAPULCO, Mexico (AP) _ Police say that a local television
reporter apparently was killed in a family dispute over property _
not for his journalism.
	   Five relatives of Pedro Valle Hernandez were arraigned Monday on
charges of participating in the Oct. 29 murder in Zihuatanejo, a
popular beach resort 120 miles (195 kilometers) northwest of here.
His cousin, Francisco Valle Torres, is accused of the actual
slaying.
	   Police had first said that Valle Hernandez's murder could be
related to reports he had filed with the state television and radio
network which were critical of local officials.
	   But investigators now say that he was killed by relatives in a
dispute over a 74-acre (30-hectare) beach lot. Valle Hernandez and
his father won a court judgment two years ago for ownership of the
lot and recently tried to evict relatives living there.

Researcher believes nerve fiber damage cause of sleep disorder
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) _ A researcher said Tuesday he believes a
breakdown of nerve fibers in the brain cause narcolepsy, a sleep
disorder that affects 250,000 people in the United States.
	   The illness stems from the breakdown of nerve fibers called
axons in the forebrain, a region active in inducing sleep, and the
amygdala, which is responsible for emotion, said Dr. Jerome Siegel,
head of neurobiology research at the Sepulveda Veterans Affairs
Medical Center in Los Angeles.
	   Siegel said at the annual meeting of the Society for
Neuroscience that he observed degeneration of axons in the
forebrain and amygdala of narcoleptic dogs just before they begin
to show symptoms.
	   ``This is the first evidence of degeneration in narcolepsy,'' he
said.
	   Siegel also found connections between groups of cells in the
amygdala and the brainstem and between the basal forebrain and the
brainstem. These may explain why the disorder involves both sleep
and motor symptoms.

Mexico says fugitive banker captured in Australia

 &UR; Eds: Leads throughout with background on Cabal Peniche, companies.

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ A politically influential banker who fled
Mexico after being accused in a dlrs 700 million bank fraud has
been captured in Melbourne, Australia, the attorney general's
office announced.
	   Carlos Cabal Peniche, 45, is accused of involvement in both
financial and political scandals that have shaken the country.
	   The attorney general's office, calling him ``Mexico's
most-wanted fugitive,'' said in a bulletin Tuesday that he was
arrested at 8 a.m. Wednesday in Melbourne, where he was carrying a
passport from the Dominican Republic in the name of Rafael Cerit
Meritt.
	   Cabal Peniche rose rapidly from obscurity to the top levels of
Mexico's business world, hobnobbing with presidents and governors
and allegedly making multi-million dollar campaign contributions.
	   In 1991, he purchased Banco Union from the government for dlrs
300 million. A year later, he merged it with Banca Cremi to form
one of Mexico's largest banking groups, with about dlrs 12 billion
in capital.
	   But regulators seized his two banks in 1994 and accused him of
misappropriating dlrs 700 million.
	   Cabal Peniche apparently was tipped off that he was about to
arrested. He fled Mexico just hours after the warrants were issued.
The attorney general's office said he now faced 10 arrest warrants.
	   His name has surfaced repeatedly in political scandals. Critics
accuse government officials of having failed to adequately screen
the banker before he was allowed to take control of the banks.
	   Many also have protested that Cabal Peniche's bad loans would be
backed by the government under a proposal by President Ernesto
Zedillo's administration to back bad loans in a bank bailout fund
with the national debt.
	   Among those loans were dlrs 4 million that allegedly went to a
ruling-party election campaign in Cabal Peniche's home state of
Tabasco.
	   The son of a local supermarket owner, Cabal Peniche began to
build a business empire in the early 1980s in the Gulf coast state
of Tabasco based on seafood and fruit.
	   Former President Carlos Salinas de Gortari, elected in 1988,
lauded Cabal Peniche as a model businessman and his companies
received credits both from government and private lenders.
	   But the speed of his rise to wealth had prompted questions in
financial news media about the source of his money.
	   Cabal bought Del Monte Fresh Produce in 1993 for about dlrs 550
million from a London bankruptcy court. In 1992, it was one of the
world's two leading marketers of fresh pineapples and the third
largest supplier of bananas.
	   Cabal also tried to buy San Francisco-based Del Monte Foods Co.
but failed in his bid when talks ended without an agreement in
1994.
	   The attorney general's office said Cabal Peniche was
masquerading as a Dominican businessman dealing in wines, cheeses
and Italian olive oil. The agency said he was living in a mansion
in Prighoen, which it identified as a luxurious suburb of
Melbourne.

Dollar falls against yen, Tokyo stock prices edge higher
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with close of morning session &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Dollar selling by U.S. funds pushed the currency
down slightly against the yen in Tokyo on Wednesday, while stock
prices edged up in quiet trading.
	   The dollar bought 121.74 yen at the end of the morning session
at 11 a.m. (0200 GMT), down 0.58 yen from late Tuesday in Tokyo and
below its late New York level of 122.52 yen overnight.
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average gained 24.02
points, or 0.17 percent, to 14,132.11 points by the end of the
morning session. On Tuesday, the Nikkei closed down 86.45 points,
or 0.61 percent.
	   In currency trading, dollar-selling weighed against the U.S.
currency, but buying interest from Japanese trust banks provided
support for the dollar above 121 yen, dealers said.
	   The dollar was expected to trade in a narrow band against the
yen, due to a lack of trading factors and ahead of a holiday
Wednesday in New York, dealers said.
	   ``The New York market will be closed so market action is slow
and the dollar-yen will move in a tight range,'' said Shuji Takano,
assistant manager of foreign exchange at ABN AMRO Bank in Tokyo.
	   Doubts about Japan's economic reform efforts also weighed
against a surge by the yen.
	   In a Washington speech on Tuesday, U.S. Treasury Secretary
Robert Rubin said Japan still has much work left to turn its
economy around, rekindling currency traders' increasing pessimism
about the Japanese economy.
	   On the stock market, share prices moved in a narrow range amid
quiet trading as many investors stayed on the sidelines ahead of
the release of a government stimulus package next week.
	   The ruling Liberal Democratic Party was expected to decide on a
basic framework for the stimulus plan Thursday before formally
announcing it Monday.
	   Yasuo Ueki, general manager at Nikko Securities, said the Nikkei
average was likely to fluctuate in a tight range between 14,000 and
14,300 for the rest of the day amid a lack of fresh market-moving
news.

Thousands vie to finish shuttle astronaut's poem
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan's starry-eyed poets are sending in their
lines by the thousands to Discovery space shuttle astronaut Chiaki
Mukai.
	   During a television broadcast Nov. 5 while in orbit, the
Japanese astronaut invited viewers to finish her tanka, a
traditional Japanese poetic form, that began: ``Turn space
somersaults, As many as you like, That is weightlessness.''
	   More than 15,000 entries have been received by post card, and
about 6,000 by the Internet, Yasuyuki Fukumuro, a spokesman for the
National Space Development Agency, Japan's NASA, said Wednesday.
	   ``Many people are putting in serious efforts,'' Fukumuro said.
	   He declined to give examples to avoid compromising the contest,
which ends Dec. 1.
	   Far less popular was the contest to name Mukai's teddy bear,
which also flew aboard the U.S. shuttle. Although Mukai solicited
suggestions at the same time as the poem, so few have been received
NASDA is not even counting those entries.
	   The winners will be chosen about mid-December and will each
receive a Discovery patch as a prize. Mukai, the first Japanese to
fly in space twice, will be among the judges.

	   TEGUCIGALPA, Honduras (AP) _ The wife of the U.S. vice president
brought congressmen, medical supplies and a promise of an
additional dlrs 10 million in U.S. aid to hurricane-devastated
Central America.
	   Tipper Gore landed at the central Honduran air base of Soto Cano
Tuesday, took a U.S. C-130 cargo plane to Tegucigalpa, the capital,
and immediately went on a helicopter tour to view storm damage.
	   She saw entire blocks of Tegucigalpa devastated by river
flooding and fields of destroyed and withering crops nestled among
the cloud-shrouded mountains that surround the capital.
	   ``The world must know the tragedy in Honduras is of biblical
proportions,'' Mrs. Gore said. ``We are here today because we are
neighbors who care and because you and we are all Americans.''
	   Mrs. Gore later shoveled sludge into a wheelbarrow at a school
in a downtown neighborhood still digging itself out from tons of
mud, and she prepared tortillas for dinner at a shelter at another
school. Residents watched from rooftops and lined streets as Mrs.
Gore walked arm-in-arm with children, inspecting damage and
stopping occasionally to take pictures.
	   ``The important people never come to this neighborhood,'' said a
beaming Claudia Boquin, 27.
	   Mrs. Gore met with Honduran President Carlos Flores and helped
serve rice and beans and tortillas at Tegucigalpa's Manuel Bonilla
School. She was staying overnight at another shelter before leaving
Wednesday for Managua, Nicaragua.
	   Elizabeth Dole, head of the American Red Cross and wife of
former presidential candidate Bob Dole, also traveled to
Tegucigalpa, visiting food distribution and relief centers.
	   Mrs. Gore delivered an aid shipment that included blankets,
sheets and 500 gallons (1,900 liters) of drinking water for
residents who have had little since Mitch wreaked havoc on this
Central American country last month, killing 6,600.
	   Stressing Washington's commitment to long-term relief, she said
U.S. military engineers were rushing to Honduras to repair roads
and bridges and ensure that fuel and food could be moved to
stricken towns.
	   Experts with the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development also planned to come to Honduras to help local
authorities rebuild, she said.
	   Delivering aid donated by citizens in the states of Mississippi,
Louisiana and Georgia, Mrs. Gore said U.S. citizens already had
donated 1 million pounds (450,000 kilograms) in goods for Central
American storm victims.
	   The dlrs 10 million in new aid for various projects is in
addition to the dlrs 70 million the Clinton administration already
has committed to Central America.
	   The United States also was signing agreements worth dlrs 2
million to help restore water service in Tegucigalpa, Mrs. Gore
said.
	   Mrs. Gore said she would phone Clinton from Central America to
update him on relief needs.

Iraq appeals to Arabs as impasse over U.N. inspections drags on

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraq is trying to build support in the Arab
world in its dispute with U.N. weapons inspectors, hoping to
isolate American efforts to rally international backing for the use
of force against the Iraqis.
	   Iraq's foreign minister gave his first interview on the dispute
to an Arab television station _ Qatar's Al-Jazeera. The crisis
began Oct. 31 when Iraq halted cooperation with U.N. weapons
inspectors.
	   The minister, Mohammed Saeed Al-Sahhaf, on Tuesday warned that
``any use of military force against Iraq would lead to
destabilizing the region.''
	   Hours later in Washington, President Bill Clinton met with
senior Pentagon officials Tuesday to explore options for a possible
military attack on Iraq. Defense Secretary William Cohen stepped up
the movement of U.S. ships into the region.
	   ``The military option is still on the table,'' Cohen said.
	   The United States and Britain have threatened military action to
force Iraq to resume cooperation with the weapons inspectors.
	   The monitors must certify that Baghdad is rid of weapons of mass
destruction before the sanctions can be lifted. Sanctions were
imposed after Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
	   Nizar Hamdoon, Iraq's ambassador to the United Nations, said
Tuesday that ``we have to prepare ourself for a strike obviously _
this does not mean that we don't encourage diplomacy.''
	   He said Iraq has kept channels open through U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan's envoy in Baghdad, Prakash Shah, but
that ``nothing really has moved today.''
	   ``There are intensive contacts between the different capitals
with Baghdad, and hopefully this could produce some initiatives
that could help us in finding a common ground,'' he said later in
an interview on WNET television in New York.
	   U.N. chief weapons inspector Richard Butler, interviewed on the
same program, urged Iraq to realize that disarmament is connected
to sanctions.
	   ``The key is in its hands _ and it's called full disclosure to
us,'' he said.
	   In mobilizing support for Iraq, the country's trade minister,
Mohammed Mehdi Saleh, said Tuesday that America ``will lose from
any strike that takes place, and Iraq will gain.''
	   He said the United States would be isolated ``politically'' _
especially on the Arab streets _ by an attack.
	   Saleh made his comments at the closing ceremony of a 10-day
trade fair in Baghdad that drew delegations from 30 countries, 17
of them Arab or predominantly Muslim.
	   The tactic of appealing to the Arabs is one indication of how
differently the current dispute is unfolding compared to one that
ended earlier this year.
	   When Iraq refused U.N. inspectors access to President Saddam
Hussein's palaces, Russia, France and Turkey rushed envoys to Iraq
to try to head off a military strike by the United States.
	   The dispute was resolved on Feb. 23 when Annan traveled to
Baghdad and reached a last-minute agreement with Saddam to open the
palace compounds.
	   This time, Iraq's defiance is not over a technical issue _ such
as whether palaces were subject to inspection _ but over the
premise of whether there should be an inspection program.
	   Iraq has said it will not resume cooperation with the U.N.
Special Commission until the Security Council begins to move toward
ending the sanctions.
	   There already are hints Iraq is prepared to go further in spite
of the U.S. and British threats.
	   Iraq _ and some other Arab countries _ apparently hope Annan
will again step in. In Washington, however, such reports were
discounted and officials said whatever diplomacy is going on has
been limited.
	   Iraq so far has let weapons experts stay in the country,
although they are not allowed to do field work
	   Iraq's Oct. 31 decision exempted nuclear experts, and teams from
the International Atomic Energy Agency have gone into the field
almost every day.

Puerto Rican newspaper claims sabotage
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) _ This island's only English-language
newspaper claimed that sabotage forced delays in printing two
editions this week.
	   In a full-page explanation to readers Tuesday, San Juan Star
publisher Gerry Angulo said saboteurs put glue in pressroom
equipment, clogged a tube feeding ink to the press and damaged the
press' electronic equipment.
	   Angulo said police were investigating the damage, but he did not
speculate as to who may have caused it. He did not return calls
Tuesday.
	   The San Juan Star recently laid off about 30 temporary workers,
many of them translators for the newspaper's Spanish-language
edition. Rival newspapers reported the Star also eliminated one
shift in the pressroom.
	   Last year, company officials claimed someone tried to sabotage
equipment in the newspaper's mailroom and accused rival newspaper
carriers of throwing bundles of the Star into garbage bins.

Ethnic tensions highlight local Israeli voting

<TEXT>
	   ASHKELON, Israel (AP) _ In this ethnically divided Israeli town,
the Moroccan-born mayor cut a deal with the Russian party to
survive local elections.
	   In Jerusalem, an ultra-Orthodox rabbi promised an eternity in
heaven to all who voted for candidates of the religious party Shas.
And in northern Israel, a centenarian sage prayed from a circling
helicopter to win last-minute support for his candidate.
	   Israel's nationwide elections Tuesday for mayor and city
councils reflected the increasing fragmentation of Israeli society
along ethnic and religious lines.
	   Marked by campaign stunts and some violence, they were also a
sign of the decaying power once held by the country's two main
national parties, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's Likud and the
Labor opposition.
	   In all, 682 candidates competed for 58 mayor spots, and more
than 20,000 hopefuls ran for 2,800 seats on local councils.
	   In Tel Aviv, liberal candidate Ron Huldai was elected by a
landslide and Jerusalem's Ehud Olmert, a member of the Likud party
who has appealed to religious voters, was re-elected to a second
term, exit polls indicated.
	   In other major cities, according to exit polls, Beersheba
Labor's candidate for mayor, Yaacov Terner beat the Likud
incumbent. In Tiberias, the Likud's Benny Kiriati ousted Zvi Cohen
of Shas. And in Netanya, Likud's Miriam Feierberg beat the Labor
incumbent to become the first woman mayor in a major Israeli city.
	   Official results were expected later Wednesday.
	   In the ancient Mediterranean city of Ashkelon, the ethnic
tensions surrounding election day were highlighted by the stabbing
death Friday of a Russian immigrant, allegedly killed for speaking
in his mother-tongue. Four Israelis of Morrocan descent were in
custody for the murder.
	   About 30,000 Russian-speaking immigrants now live in the seaside
port and they were expected to overwhelmingly support the immigrant
rights party, Israel B'Aliya, which is running mostly
Russian-speaking candidates in local elections for the first time.
	   Hoping to restore the uneasy peace between the two immigrant
groups and keep his seat in power, Benny Vaknin, the Morrocan-born
incumbent mayoral candidate, promised to appoint a Russian speaker
as his deputy if the party dropped plans to run a candidate against
him. With 30 percent of the population behind them, Israel B'Aliya
agreed.
	   In traditionally Arab east Jerusalem, meanwhile, an Arab
insurance broker defied an election boycott called by Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat's government to protest Israeli rule in the
contested sector.
	   Moussa Aliyan, the first Arab to run for City Council, said he
wanted to show the city's 180,000 Palestinian residents that the
only way to get more classrooms, new roads and a sewage system was
to participate in local politics.
	   ``They are not getting what they are entitled to because of the
boycott,'' Aliyan said. A newcomer to politics, Aliyan said he has
received death threats in recent weeks, but was not deterred.
	   Israeli police arrested two Palestinan Authority activists for
threatening Palestinian voters. Six others were detained for trying
to shut down shops not participating in a partial commercial strike
called to protest the election.
	   For the city's Jewish voters, a growing culture clash between
religious and secular Jews over the role of religion in daily life
pitted the two groups against one another at the polls.
	   The Shas religious party, which draws much of its support from
Moroccan Jews, appealed to a wider audience with promises of
blessings from aged rabbis. Weeks before the vote, they handed out
amulets, lucky charms and posters of their party's spiritual
leader.
	   But aside from the last-minute campaign tactics, low voter
turnout and a high number of violent incidents at polling stations
were what made headlines in Israel.
	   Police spokeswoman Linda Menuhin said officers responded to 278
violent incidents throughout the country.
	   In Tel Aviv, a switchboard serving the offices of mayoral
candidate Huldai was set on fire, a firebomb was thrown at the
another candidate's house, and the car of a campaign volunteer was
torched.
	   There were several incidents of election fraud. In Jerusalem,
police arrested two minors who tried to cast ballots using false
registration papers. As the campaign drew to a close, there were
incidents of arson and fistfights among rival party workers.

Report: Japan Development Bank to lend funds to Nissan Motor
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ A Japanese government-run financial institution
will extend 100 billion yen (dlrs 820 million) in a special loan to
Nissan Motor Co., a news report said Wednesday.
	   The loan by the Japan Development Bank, to be made next month,
will be the largest ever given to a single company, Kyodo News
service said.
	   The money will apparently be used to pay back funds Nissan
borrowed from commercial banks, Kyodo said.
	   Tatsuya Onishi, a spokesman at Tokyo-based Japan Development
Bank, said the bank does business with Nissan, but added he could
not comment on individual loan cases.
	   Nissan spokesman Keiichi Tsuboi said the automaker, Japan's
second-largest, was working to confirm the report.
	   Nissan Motor said Tuesday it posted a net loss of 32.6 billion
yen (dlrs 267 million) for the six months ended in September,
reflecting a sharp fall in the value of its investment in domestic
stocks.
	   Nissan said it has been hit by a deepening slump in demand for
vehicles in its recession-hit home market. Total sales, including
overseas, over the sixth-month period declined 7.7 percent from a
year earlier.
	   Nissan has already agreement with a group of about 10 Japanese
commercial banks to obtain funds in a loan framework totaling 500
billion yen (dlrs 4.09 billion) to deal with the credit crunch.

Foreign investment in China forecast to fall
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Foreign direct investment is declining as
recessions in neighboring Asian countries slow the flow of funds
into China, the official newspaper China Daily reported Wednesday.
	   Citing a report by the United Nations Conference on Trade and
Development, or Unctad, the newspaper said foreign direct
investment in China was forecast to fall by 12 percent this year to
dlrs 40 billion from dlrs 45.3 billion last year.
	   Southeast Asia, Hong Kong, South Korea and Japan account for
about two-thirds of China's total foreign direct investment. The
report said prolonged malaise in those economies was taking its
toll on China.
	   ``Is the foreign direct investment boom in China over? We cannot
say so categorically,'' the newspaper quoted Sun Weiyun, an Unctad
spokesman in China, as saying.
	   ``We are suggesting that a combination of factors may lead to a
slowdown of inflows in 1998, even though we do expect China to
continue to attract high volumes,'' he was quoted as saying.
	   According to earlier reports, foreign direct investment remained
steady in the first three quarters of this year at dlrs 31.4
billion, while pledged investment rose 2.45 percent to dlrs 35.8
billion.
	   China's foreign direct investment volume in 1997 accounted for
almost half the flows into the Asia-Pacific region and about
one-third of all foreign direct investment in developing countries,
the report said.
	   China has ranked second behind the United States in attracting
foreign direct investment for the past six years. China's foreign
investment in other countries reached dlrs 2.5 billion last year,
the report said without providing a forecast for 1998.

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Lawyers battling to free Gen. Augusto Pinochet
from arrest are using a range of arguments in Britain's highest
court, from saying the former Chilean dictator is immune under
English law to claims that it is dangerous for one nation to pass
judgment on another.
	   The hearing in the House of Lords on Wednesday enters its fifth
day of intricate legal argument, including comparisons with the
famed Nuremberg trials of Nazi leaders and recent trials of Rwandan
Hutus charged with mass ethnic slaughter of Tutsis in 1994.
	   On Wednesday, in a rare move, the judges were scheduled to hear
arguments from an independent expert on international law, David
Lloyd-Jones, designated a ``friend of the court.''
	   Pinochet, 82, was arrested Oct. 16 at the request of a Spanish
magistrate seeking to extradite him to face charges of genocide,
murder and kidnapping. He is recuperating from back surgery and
remains hospitalized under police guard.
	   A Chilean government report says some 3,000 people were murdered
or disappeared at the hands of secret police during Pinochet's
17-year-old rule after he ousted Salvador Allende, an elected
Marxist, in a 1973 military coup.
	   Spanish and British prosecutors have appealed an Oct. 28
decision by the High Court quashing Pinochet's arrest on grounds
that as a former foreign head of state he has immunity from
prosecution in this country.
	   The appeal hearing was scheduled to continue through Wednesday
and perhaps into Thursday, with judgment likely next week, court
officials said.
	   Clare Montgomery, among half-a-dozen British lawyers appearing
for Pinochet, said Tuesday that upholding his arrest would upset
British-Chile relations as well as endanger democracy developed in
Chile since Pinochet stepped down in 1990.
	   ``If judicial restraint was ever called for it is called for in
this case,'' she said.
	   Lawyers for the prosecutors say Pinochet is responsible for
deeds beyond immunity.

IOC to consider dropping some narcotics says official
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By TONY HARPER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Medical commission member Dr. Ken Fitch
has tipped a ``radical'' overhaul of the International Olympic
Committee's drug policy at a meeting next month, including the
removal of some narcotics from the banned list.
	   Fitch, who is on the medical commissions for both the IOC and
Sydney Olympic organizers SOCOG, said he would also urge a return
to pre-competition testing by the IOC in the days leading up to the
2000 Games.
	   Fitch said he supported comments by IOC president Juan Antonio
Samaranch earlier this year that the banned list needed
simplification.
	   ``President Samaranch's comments have thrown open our chances to
have a more radical look at the list than we have in recent
years,'' Fitch said Wednesday.
	   ``Mainly drugs like morphine, pethidine,'' needed to be dropped
from the banned list, Fitch said. He said heroin would remain on
the list.
	   ``Narcotics were put on originally because cyclists were
misusing them by injecting themselves at the end of a six-day race
to get across the line and then have a big sleep. It's not being
used (now) in sports. It's a therapeutic problem and should be kept
that way.''
	   He said the IOC medical commission would meet during December.
The IOC has planned a major anti-drug conference for February.
	   Fitch argued unsuccessfully for the reintroduction of pre-games
testing at the Atlanta Olympics but he believes the IOC might have
a change of heart for Sydney. Pre-games testing was in place at the
1976 Olympics because results took up to 10 days to come back from
the laboratory.
	   ``The IOC have been saying we don't take precedence over these
athletes until the games start, but in actual fact we do, once the
village opens they have to comply with village rules and it makes
no sense to me that we can't test,'' said Fitch.
	   Fitch also criticized IOC medical commission chief Prince
Alexandre de Merode, one of the loudest opponents of Samaranch's
call to simplify the banned list.
	   ``I don't think at the moment that some of his philosophies are
current for 2000,'' Fitch said. ``He's been opposed to things like
blood-testing, to pre-games testing.''
	   Fitch said he remained hopeful that reliable tests would be
available for the Sydney Olympics to test for EPO and human growth
hormone.
	   But he disagreed with British doping expert Professor David
Cowan who told the AP on Tuesday that he thought a test for HGH was
more likely than a test for EPO.
	   ``I think the EPO is a better bet for 2000,'' Fitch said.
``Whether it'll be a blood test or a urine test I'm not sure.''
	   No valid tests exist for detecting HGH and EPO, but Cowan said
blood tests were probably necessary.
	   Growth hormone helps build strength, while EPO _ the drug at the
center of this year's Tour de France scandals _ is an
endurance-boosting hormone.

New book describes espionage role of U.S. submarine
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; RETRANSMITTING to conform with digest &QL; 
 &UR; By JOHN DIAMOND &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Years after a U.S. Navy turncoat informed the
Soviets of an undersea eavesdropping operation in the Pacific, U.S.
intelligence continued to collect information from another Soviet
communications cable under the Barents Sea, according to a new book
on submarine spy wars.
	   In a tale that has the Navy refusing to comment and retired
submariners rejoicing that their story is finally being told,
``Blind Man's Bluff'' uncovers new detail about how U.S. submarine
forces were used for much more than chasing Soviet subs under the
Arctic ice.
	   Through unofficial sources such as retired submarine crews,
authors Sherry Sontag and Christopher Drew pieced together the 1979
voyage of the USS Parche, a nuclear-powered attack submarine sent
on a mission of espionage.
	   With the personal approval of President Carter, the Parche moved
under the polar ice cap into the Barents Sea, the authors write.
Locked in the vessel's torpedo room were a crew of communications
experts, the ``spooks,'' as the crew referred to them. They used a
deployable remote camera to find a military communications cable
linking the Soviet port of Murmansk to the major northern bases of
the Soviet fleet.
	   Settling the submarine quietly to the bottom, and operating well
within Soviet territorial waters, the crew attached to the cable a
listening pod specially designed by Bell Laboratories.
	   ``It would take the spooks at least two weeks to sift
electronically through the hundreds of lines running through the
cable and choose which lines to record,'' the authors write.
	   In case Parche was detected, another Navy submarine lurked
nearby to throw up a diversion should the Soviets attempt to seize
the spy sub, according to the book. If all else failed, the captain
was under orders to blow up his own ship, taking his crew, the
spooks and the espionage equipment with him.
	   The eavesdropping system required return missions to change
recording tapes. Meanwhile, the National Security Agency, the
super-secret U.S. decoding center, feasted on an intelligence
mother lode, the authors say.
	   The tap opened to U.S. scrutiny Soviet navy planning for nuclear
warfare, showing, among other things, that Soviet naval forces were
not designed to launch a first strike. CIA and NSA officials came
to refer to the intelligence flowing from the Barents cable as
``the big casino'' or ``the crown jewels.''
	   Within three years, another undersea cable tap, this one in the
Sea of Okhotsk near a Soviet sub base on the Kamchatka Peninsula in
the Pacific, would be compromised by the spy Ronald Pelton, a
former NSA cryptologist.
	   In late 1981, the Soviets pulled up the Okhotsk tap pod _
helpfully marked, ``Property of the United States Government.'' A
senior Naval Intelligence official suspected a turncoat, a hunch
confirmed in 1985 with Pelton's arrest. Only then did the level of
risk involved in returning to the underwater tap sites become
clear. Nevertheless, the Barents cable continued to provide
intelligence through the end of the Cold War.
	   These and other espionage missions described in the book, which
is published by Public Affairs, are among the most sensitive and
secret intelligence operations of the Cold War. Most have never
been described in detail, if at all, and the Navy to this day
refuses to acknowledge them publicly.
	   ``This book does not represent the views of the United States
Navy and any accounts have been derived strictly through unofficial
sources,'' according to a Navy statement. Commenting on the events
described in the book, ``could be deemed detrimental to national
security interests.''
	   Internal Navy guidance on the book directs commanders to remind
their crews ``that there is no change to existing policies
prohibiting the release of classified information, nor to the
policy of not discussing specific submarine operations.'' A copy of
the guidance was obtained by The Associated Press.

Queen gives teenage rock band their big break
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Note band's name uses an exclamation mark sted of letter
''i'' &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ An unknown teenage rock band wanted a chance to
play for the queen.
	   Now they've got it.
	   Queen Elizabeth II invited Al!ve, a band of four boys ages 16
and 17, to play at Buckingham Palace on Friday for Prince Charles's
50th birthday party. The queen issued the invitation after the
teens sent her a short letter and a sample of their music.
	   ''We would have asked Prince Charles, but as Buckingham Palace
is your house, we thought we should ask you first,'' the teens
wrote to the monarch. ''We've put a nice slow song on the CD first
cos we thought you wouldn't be into heavy stuff.''
	   Band members Andy Ross, Darren Kane, Martin Whyment and Craig
Stelnicki, all from Manchester in northern England, will play two
20-minute sets in front of 800 guests.
	   ''It would be a really good gig for us and ... might help us
swing a record contract,'' the teens wrote. ''If you can give us a
break, it would be cool.''
	   The Buckingham Palace concert will be their first time playing
in London. Most of the group's shows have been school concerts
around their hometown. The band members, who have been playing
together for two years, won a 5,000 pounds (dlrs 8,000) grant from
the national lottery last year; they used the money to buy new
lights and sound equipment.
	   But the teens still haven't hit the big time _ their fathers are
the roadies and their mothers help sell posters. The band is hoping
this show will propel them to fame and fortune.
	   In asking to play for the queen, the four teens assured her that
they are ''good lads who don't do drugs, aren't scruffy and don't
use foul language.''
	   A Buckingham Palace spokesman said Prince Charles, the queen's
oldest son, was ''delighted'' that the band was booked to play at
his party.

Indonesian assembly meets for second day amid fears of more fights
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By GEOFF SPENCER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ A special assembly convened for a
second day to debate political reform in Indonesia Wednesday amid
fears of more student protests and street fighting by rival mobs.
	   The People's Consultative Assembly, the nation's highest
legislative body, will meet until Friday to map out a new political
system after decades of military-backed authoritarian rule under
ex-President Suharto.
	   He was forced to quit last May after protests and riots ended
with 1,200 people killed in Jakarta.
	   The assembly is to set a date for parliamentary elections,
probably in May. It is also expected to support new laws to
legalize a large number of new political parties.
	   It is expected to back moves to reduce, but not abolish, the
military's representation in Parliament.
	   Leading opposition figures are not included in its ranks and the
students and other opponents are unconvinced by promises that the
assembly will institute sweeping democratic change.
	   The students want the military out of politics and demand that
Suharto be tried for corruption and human rights abuses.
	   Many suspect President B.J. Habibie, once a Suharto protege,
will use this week's meeting to bolster his position. He is
expected to be a candidate for the presidency when the assembly
chooses a head of state late next year.
	   Last May students occupied the Parliament building for days
before Suharto to quit after 32 years in power.
	   On Tuesday, students staged a number of big demonstrations, but
were stopped from getting near the legislature by the deployment of
30,000 troops and police across the capital of 11 million.
	   There were no reports of protests or trouble early Wednesday.
	   The streets were quiet and traffic in the normally congested
city was light. Many residents chose to stay at home. Some shops
and schools were closed.
	   When the session opened on Tuesday pro and anti-government
groups clashed and threw rocks at one another in several areas
before being dispersed by security personnel.
	   Much of Tuesday's trouble involved teen-age boys armed with
knives and bamboo spears.
	   Local media reports estimate that as many as 120,000 have been
recruited by pro-government activists as private security guards to
protect the assembly from student protests.
	   Newspapers said police and troops had confiscated many of the
guards' weapons late Tuesday.
	   On Tuesday night, a convoy of 30 buses carrying student
protesters, some sitting on the roofs and waving red and white
Indonesian flags, drove past the Parliament. They taunted phalanxes
of police and soldiers lined up in front of the gates, but there
were no clashes.

	   TAMPA, Florida (AP) _ Kevin Stevens had three goals and two
assists and Ulf Samuelsson scored twice as the New York Rangers
beat the Tampa Bay Lightning 10-2 Tuesday night.
	   The Rangers entered the game as the NHL's lowest-scoring team
with 24 goals. After scoring 18 goals in their first 12 games, the
Rangers have erupted for 16 in their last two.
	   The Rangers last scored 10 goals in a game on Dec. 13, 1992 in a
10-5 victory over Montreal.
	   Stevens completed his first hat trick since Jan. 11, 1994 with
5:16 left to play. He recorded five points in a game for the first
time since Oct. 17, 1992.
	   Daymond Langkow and Enrico Ciccone, who scored his first goal
since Feb. 6, 1997, scored for Tampa Bay.
 &UR; Sabres 2, Senators 2 &QC; 
	   In Buffalo, New York, Curtis Brown's shorthanded goal and
Dominik Hasek's 38 saves helped Buffalo extend its unbeaten streak
to six games with a tie against Ottawa.
	   Senators goaltender Damian Rhodes stopped 21 shots, including a
spectacular diving glove save on Miroslav Satan with eight minutes
left in the third period that preserved the tie.
	   Hasek made 34 straight saves during the game and is now 17-4-2
against the Senators.
 &UR; Penguins 3, Islanders 2
	   In Pittsburgh, Robert Lang and Martin Straka scored in the
second period to help the Penguins beat the New York Islanders and
win their first home game.
	   Pittsburgh had been 0-1-3 at home and the last NHL team without
a win on home ice. Overall, the Penguins are unbeaten in four
(2-0-2) while the Islanders have lost three of four.
	   Lang scored 54 seconds into the second period to break a 1-1
tie. Straka made it 3-1 with his fifth goal at 11:29.

Brazil's Palmeiras beat Paraguay's Olimpia in Mercosur Cup
</HEADLINE>
semi-final

<TEXT>
	   SAO PAULO, Brazil (AP) _ Alex led Brazil league leaders
Palmeiras to a 2-0 win over Paraguay's Olimpia in the first leg of
this Mercosur Cup semifinal on Tuesday.
	   The 21-year-old midfielder scored twice either side of half-time
to push the Sao Paulo side closer to the final which carries a dlrs
3 million prize for the winners.
	   Palmeiras pinned down Olimpia in and around their penalty box
for large parts of the first half.
	   But it was not until a few seconds before half-time that
midfielder Alex broke the deadlock.
	   His low, hard shot deflected off a Olimpia defender's leg and
over goalie Taverelli's head.
	   Four minutes into the second half, Alex further wrecked the
Paraguyan's side defensive strategy with another goal.
	   The Brazilian international seized on a loose ball and scooped
into the roof of the net.
	   Olimpia substitute Cruz had seen his shot saved by goalie
Velloso's legs a minute earlier.
	   After the second goal, the Paraguayan side who had started
playing with five defenders, were forced to change tactics.
	   But despite opening up their formation they were short on
creative ideas and mustered few chances.
	   The return leg will be played in Asuncion, Paraguay next
Tuesday, Nov.17.
	   The other semi-finalists, Argentina's San Lorenzo and Brazil's

	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ A politically influential banker who
fled Mexico after being accused in an Australian dollars 1.1
billion (U.S. dlrs 700 million) bank fraud has been captured in
Australia, Australian and Mexican authorities said Wednesday.
	   Carlos Cabal Peniche, 45, who is accused in financial and
political scandals that have shaken Mexico, was arrested by
Australian Federal Police officers at about 7.30 a.m. Wednesday
(2030 GMT Tuesday) at a house in the seaside suburb of Brighton in
the southeastern city of Melbourne, agent Keith Livingstone said.
	   Australian agents were tipped off to his presence by Interpol,
and worked with Mexican Federal Judicial Police and the U.S.
Federal Bureau of Investigation to find and identify him.
	   Cabal Peniche appeared in the Melbourne Magistrate's court on a
provisional warrant from Mexico on ``a number of fraud-related
offenses,'' Livingston said.
	   Magistrate Barry Braun remanded him in custody and ordered he
reappear on Dec. 17.
	   In a brief hearing, Cabal Peniche made no application for bail,
but reserved his right to challenge the validity of the extradition
warrant at a future hearing.
	   ``In the interim, Australian authorities are liaising with
Mexican law enforcement agencies, who will be seeking to have him
extradited from Australia to face charges in Mexico,'' Livingston
said.
	   The Mexican attorney general's department, calling him
``Mexico's most-wanted fugitive,'' said Cabal Peniche was carrying
a passport from the Dominican Republic in the name of Rafael Cerit
Meritt.
	   He admitted his true identity when questioned by Australian
agents, Australian Justice Minister Amanda Vanstone said.
	   Cabal Peniche rose rapidly from obscurity to the top levels of
Mexico's business world, hobnobbing with presidents and governors
and allegedly making multi-million dollar campaign contributions.
	   In 1991, he purchased Banco Union from the government for
Australian 476 million (U.S. dlrs 300 million). A year later, he
merged it with Banca Cremi to form one of Mexico's largest banking
groups, with about Australian dollars 19 billion (U.S. dlrs 12
billion) in capital.
	   But regulators seized his two banks in 1994 and accused him of
misappropriating Australian dollars 1.1 billion (U.S. dlrs 700
million).
	   Cabal Peniche apparently was tipped off that he was about to
arrested. He fled Mexico just hours after the warrants were issued.
The attorney general's office said he now faced 10 arrest warrants.
	   His name has surfaced repeatedly in political scandals. Critics
accuse government officials of failing to adequately screen the
banker before he was allowed to take control of the banks.
	   Many also have protested that Cabal Peniche's bad loans would be
backed by the government under a proposal by President Ernesto
Zedillo's administration to back bad loans in a bank bailout fund
with the national debt.
	   Among those loans were Australian dollars 6.3 million (U.S. dlrs
4 million) that allegedly went to a ruling-party election campaign
in Cabal Peniche's home state of Tabasco.
	   The son of a local supermarket owner, Cabal Peniche began to
build a business empire in the early 1980s in the Gulf coast state
of Tabasco based on seafood and fruit.
	   Former President Carlos Salinas de Gortari, elected in 1988,
lauded Cabal Peniche as a model businessman and his companies
received credits both from government and private lenders.
	   But the speed of his rise to wealth had prompted questions in
financial news media about the source of his money.
	   Cabal bought Del Monte Fresh Produce in 1993 for about
Australian dollars 873 million (U.S. dlrs 550 million) from a
London bankruptcy court. In 1992, it was one of the world's two
leading marketers of fresh pineapples and the third largest
supplier of bananas.
	   Cabal also tried to buy San Francisco-based Del Monte Foods Co.
but failed in his bid when talks ended without an agreement in
1994.
	   The attorney general's office said Cabal Peniche was
masquerading as a Dominican businessman dealing in wines, cheeses
and Italian olive oil.

Mexican authorities link massacre to violent drug gang
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ADOLFO GARZA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ The massacre of 19 people in a small northern
Mexican community is linked to the country's most violent drug
gang, officials said.
	   In one of the bloodiest drug-related massacres in Mexico, an
alleged drug trafficker and 18 members of his extended family were
roused from their beds Sept. 17 by gunmen who lined them up against
a wall and shot them with automatic weapons.
	   The gunmen's target, a Pei Pei Indian named Fermin Castro, died
two weeks later of complications from two bullet wounds.
	   The gunmen were members of a gang led by a man known by his
associates as ``Lino Quintana,'' whose gang is an armed group that
works for Ramon Arellano Felix, Gen. Guillermo Alvarez, who
coordinates anti-drug efforts at the judicial police, said Tuesday.
	   Ramon Arellano Felix was placed on the FBI's 10 most wanted list
last year, and U.S. federal authorities have offered a dlrs 2
million reward for information leading to his arrest.
	   He and three of his brothers are fugitives who control major
routes funneling cocaine, marijuana and other drugs into the United
States across the California-Mexico border, authorities said.
	   Mexican authorities have sought the brothers since 1993.
	   Alvarez and federal prosecutors said Quintana's gang killed
Castro to keep his marijuana-trafficking operation from growing
into a potential competitor.
	   They said three suspects are in custody and warrants have been
issued for 10 others.

Report: War experiences should be applied today
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ Defense Minister Pham Van Tra has urged
that what was learned from Vietnam's wars against the French and
Americans be applied today, the People's Army newspaper reported
Wednesday.
	   ``People's warfare is an important part of the national
liberation and defense,'' Tra was quoted as saying.
	   ``The issue should be studied, and lessons should be drawn and
disseminated among army leadership to apply in building defense
regions and combat readiness in the current situation.''
	   Tra was speaking at a conference to review people's and militia
warfare against the French and Americans in 1946-75.
	   Twenty books have been published in the five years since the
Ministry of Defense issued a decision on reviewing the two wars.
	   Half of Vietnam's population has been born since the country was
reunified at the end of the Vietnam War in 1975.
	   France signed the Geneva Agreement to withdraw from Indochina
after its defeat at Dien Bien Phu in northern Vietnam in 1954.
	   Under the agreement, the country was divided along the 17th
parallel with the communist government in the north and a
pro-French regime in the south.
	   The United States officially became involved in Vietnam by
sending its first troops to the central city of Danang in 1965.
Saigon fell to the North Vietnamese in April 1975.
	   Throughout the two wars, the Vietnamese communists combined the
strength of its regular army with the people's and militia warfare.

Report: Fears over assembly slash retail sales in Indonesia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Nervousness over a government assembly
trying to draft political reform has slashed sales in the
Indonesian capital by 70 percent, the newspaper Bisnis Indonesia
said Wednesday.
	   Indonesia's retail association, Aprisindo, said many people have
opted to stay at home to avoid possible trouble during the four-day
event ending Friday.
	   ``We have conducted an observation in all shopping centers
throughout Jakarta, showing a sharp decrease in the number of
customers,'' the paper quoted the association's chairman
Kustarijono Prodjolalito as saying.
	   He said some shopping centers were closed.
	   Some street fights and protest erupted when the 1,000-member
People's Consultative Assembly was opened on Tuesday. About 30,000
troops and police have been deployed to safeguard the meeting.
	   Students and other opponents say the assembly won't deliver on
promises to introduced truly democratic reform.
	   In May, protests by students were followed by widespread rioting
in Jakarta that helped force authoritarian President Suharto quit
after 32 years in power.
	   About 1,200 people died in the violence. Many of the victims
were people trapped in shopping centers that were set afire.
	   Scores of shops, supermarkets and department stores were looted.
	   Many were owned by members of Indonesia's Chinese minority who
are prominent in the retail sector. Their relative prosperity is
resented by some other Indonesians amid the worst economic crisis
in 30 years.

	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ Australian survivors of World War I
were guests of honor at official ceremonies across the country
Wednesday to mark the conflict's end 80 years ago.
	   At the main ceremony in the national capital, Prime Minister
John Howard and Governor-General Sir William Deane were among those
who honored Australia's war dead and met six veterans of the
battlefields of the Great War.
	   More than 330,000 Australian men served overseas during the
1914-18 war and more than 61,000 were killed. Drawn from a
population of 4.8 million people, Australia had the highest per
capita death toll of any country involved.
	   Just 66 veterans of the war are still alive, according to the
Department of Veterans Affairs.
	   Remembrance ceremonies were held at monuments in all Australian
capitals and in hundreds of country towns from which many of the
fighting men were drawn.
	   About 2,000 people gathered at the Australian War Memorial in
Canberra at 11 a.m. (0000 GMT) for Armistice Day.
	   Six veterans _ Ted Smout, Howard Pope, Eric Abraham, Angus
Clark, August Brand, and Mick Holingsworth, all 100 years or older
_ were met by Howard and Deane, Queen Elizabeth II's representative
and Australia's titular head of state.
	   Howard and Deane laid wreaths at the Stone of Remembrance
following a commemorative address by the French Ambassador to
Australia, Dominique Girard.
	   Howard announced that the 66 remaining survivors would receive a
new medal, the 80th Anniversary Armistice Remembrance Medal.
	   ``The deeds of that generation of young Australians, more than
60,000 of whom lost their lives, have become a legend and continue
to inspire us all,'' Howard said.
	   ``On behalf of the nation, I thank them and express our pleasure
in honoring them with this symbol of our recognition.''

Indonesian assembly meets for second day amid fears of more fights

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ A special assembly convened for a
second day to debate political reform in Indonesia Wednesday amid
fears of more student protests and street fighting by rival mobs.
	   The People's Consultative Assembly, the nation's highest
legislative body, will meet until Friday to map out a new political
system after decades of military-backed authoritarian rule under
ex-President Suharto.
	   He was forced to quit last May after protests and riots ended
with 1,200 people killed in Jakarta.
	   The assembly is to set a date for parliamentary elections,
probably in May. It is also expected to support new laws to
legalize a large number of new political parties.
	   It is expected to back moves to reduce, but not abolish, the
military's representation in Parliament.
	   Leading opposition figures are not included in its ranks and the
students and other opponents are unconvinced by promises that the
assembly will institute sweeping democratic change.
	   The students want the military out of politics and demand that
Suharto be tried for corruption and human rights abuses.
	   Many suspect President B.J. Habibie, once a Suharto protege,
will use this week's meeting to bolster his position. He is
expected to be a candidate for the presidency when the assembly
chooses a head of state late next year.
	   Last May students occupied the Parliament building for days
before Suharto to quit after 32 years in power.
	   On Tuesday, students staged a number of big demonstrations, but
were stopped from getting near the legislature by the deployment of
30,000 troops and police across the capital of 11 million.
	   There were no reports of protests or trouble early Wednesday.
	   The streets were quiet and traffic in the normally congested
city was light. Many residents chose to stay at home. Some shops
and schools were closed.
	   Fears over potential of violence have slashed retails sales in
Jakarta by an estimated 70 percent, the newspaper Bisnis Indonesia
said.
	   About 1,200 people were killed during last May's violence, most
trapped in shopping centers that were set afire. Many were owned by
members of Indonesia's Chinese minority whose relative prosperity
is resented amid the nation's worst economic crisis in 30 years.
	   When the session opened on Tuesday pro and anti-government
groups clashed and threw rocks at one another in several areas
before being dispersed by security personnel.
	   Much of Tuesday's trouble involved teen-age boys armed with
knives and bamboo spears.
	   Local media reports estimate that as many as 120,000 have been
recruited by pro-government activists as private security guards to
protect the assembly from student protests.
	   Newspapers said police and troops had confiscated many of the
guards' weapons late Tuesday.
	   On Tuesday night, a convoy of 30 buses carrying student
protesters, some sitting on the roofs and waving red and white
Indonesian flags, drove past the Parliament. They taunted phalanxes
of police and soldiers lined up in front of the gates, but there
were no clashes.

Nippon Life, Germany's Deutsche Bank to form venture
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with confirmation of details in grafs 5 and 8; slight
editing &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan's Nippon Life Insurance Co. and Deutsche Bank
AG, Germany's largest bank, have agreed to form a joint-venture
asset management company, a spokesman for the Japanese insurer said
Tuesday.
	   Nippon Life and Deutsche Bank will set up an investment-advisory
company in London next spring to handle asset management in Europe,
said Nippon Life's Seiji Shinmura.
	   Nippon Life, Japan's largest insurer, will take a two-thirds
capital position in the venture, with Deutsche Bank holding the
remaining one-third, he said.
	   The amount of capitalization and other details will be worked
out later, Shinmura added.
	   As part of the venture, Nippon Life will establish a global
network for investment trust and asset management that will cover
three core markets across the world _ Japan, the United States and
Europe, Shinmura said.
	   Also, Nippon Life will increase its stake in Deutsche Bank's
Japanese trust-banking subsidiary to 10 percent, up from the

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ After denouncing his former
political mentor, Anwar Ibrahim returned to court Wednesday, where
he is being tried for corruption and sexual misconduct stemming
from his tenure as Malaysia's deputy prime minister.
	   Anwar arrived from a nearby prison in a convoy of police
vehicles, and was immediately taken to the defendant's dock.
	   The day before, Anwar had told reporters that his one-time
patron, Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad, was losing support both at
home and abroad.
	   ``Foreign leaders can no longer tolerate him anymore. He's
becoming recalcitrant,'' Anwar said. He said many Malaysians also
rejected Mahathir's 17-year rule.
	   Later that evening, Mahathir defended his sacking of Anwar as
the country's No. 2 official, and said he believed Anwar would
receive a fair trial.
	   ``There is no way that anybody can say that Malaysian courts
just favor the government,'' Mahathir said in a television
interview. ``They are very fair to everyone and I am quite sure
they will be fair to Anwar also.''
	   The High Court on Wednesday was expected to hear further
testimony from Abdul Aziz Hussin, the intelligence officer who
forced two key witnesses to retract their allegations of sexual
misconduct against Anwar.
	   Prosecutors allege that Anwar ordered the retractions last year
as part of a cover-up attempt. The alleged cover-up resulted in the
four corruption charges that make up the current phase of the
trial.
	   He will be tried on another charge of corruption, as well as
five sexual misconduct charges, at a later date.
	   The criminal proceedings will be suspended during next week's
summit of 21 world leaders in Kuala Lumpur.

	   FLAGSTAFF, Arizona (AP) _ Roff Land scored 23 points and Casey
Frank added 21 as Northern Arizona beat Sakalai Lithuania 101-67
Tuesday in an exhibition basketball game.
	   The Lumberjacks shot 63 percent from the field and hit 13 of 25
3-pointers.
	   Rolandas Jarutis' 3-pointer with 14:58 left to play cut Northern
Arizona's lead to 19, but that was as close as Sakalai would come.
Northern Arizona led by 20 points three times in the first half and
was up 54-33 at the break. A Dan McClintock layup late in the
second half pushed the Lumberjacks out front by 31 points, the
widest margin.
	   McClintock finished with 16 points. Michael McNair had 13 points
and Kaika Akina added 12.
	   Ramunas Siskauskas led Sakalai with 21 points, and Jarutis had
17.
