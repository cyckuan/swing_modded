<HEADLINE> Nepali Team to Leave for Bhutan for Talks on Refugee </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, November 22 (Xinhua) -- Nepal and Bhutan will break
the two-year deadlock over the refugee issue as a Nepali team led
by Home Minister Govind Raj Joshi is scheduled to fly to Bhutan
Monday for talks over the problem.
</P>
<P>
Hiranya Lal Shrestha, chairman of the Lower House Foreign
Relations and Human Rights Committee, said that now the stalemate
has been broken between the two Himalayan kingdoms.
</P>
<P>
"The process has started again," he said. He is also included
in the six-member delegation.
</P>
<P>
About 100,000 Bhutanese refugees are staying in eight U.N.-run
camps in eastern Nepal after being forced to flee Bhutan in 1989
and the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
Before April 1996, Nepal and Bhutan had held seven rounds of
ministerial talks but without any result.
</P>
<P>
Bhutan insisted that it would take back only those of genuine
Bhutanese origin.
</P>
<P>
India, which handles Bhutan's foreign and defense affairs, has
refused to get involved, saying it is a bilateral matter.
</P>
<P>
A Nepali parliamentary team led by Hiranya Lal Shrestha visited
Bhutan early this month, touching upon the issue.

<HEADLINE> Improved Cocoa Output Expected in West Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, November 22 (Xinhua) -- Experts said that the cocoa
production in West Africa is expected to be improved because of
the unusual late rains along the cocoa growing belt including
Nigeria, Ghana and Cote d'Ivoire.
</P>
<P>
The experts said the pattern of rainfall which is heavy
downpour mostly at night and sunshine during the day, is
particularly conducive to cocoa production, according to Sunday's
Guardian newspaper.
</P>
<P>
"If we have rains till March, then the cocoa season is going
to be prolonged and there will be no break between the main and
light crop season at all," said Prince Pade Adams Momoh, National
Secretary of the Cocoa Exporters Association of Nigeria (CEAN).
</P>
<P>
Under normal weather conditions, the main crop season lasts
between October and March.
</P>
<P>
Cote d'Ivoire and Ghana, major cocoa producers and exporters
in the world, produced one million tons and 350,000 tons
respectively in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria's annual cocoa production had declined from 1.2
million tons to the current 140,000 tons and the CEAN is
embarking on a number of initiatives to increase the country's
annual cocoa production to 1.2 million tons by the year 2008.
</P>
<P>
However, experts said, the expected gains from the increased
output is being countervailed by a significant drop in world
chocolate consumption due to the economic crisis in the Asian
countries which consume about one third of the world's chocolate
production.
</P>
<P>
Besides, they noted, some of the biggest cocoa processing
companies in Europe have been buying up cocoa from European
warehouses, rather than from the sources in Africa.
</P>
<P>
This practice has lowered the international price of cocoa,
the paper said, adding that the price of the commodity has gone
down from 1,700 U.S. Dollars F.O.B. per ton in 1997 to 1,400
Dollars this year, representing a decrease of about 18 percent.
</P>
<P>
Experts predicted that the international cocoa price would
further fall to between 1,300 Dollars and 1,200 Dollars per ton.

<HEADLINE> American Visitors Attacked in Iran </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, November 22 (Xinhua) -- A group of 13 American
visitors were attacked in northern Tehran and were forced to
leave Iran by Iranian hardliners on Saturday morning.
</P>
<P>
The hardliners shouted slogans against the United States and
broke window panes of the car carrying the American visitors, a
hardline evening newspaper Kayhan reported on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Following the attack, the American delegation left Tehran for
Washington Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
It was the first violent attack on an American delegation in
Iran after the election of the moderate President Mohammad
Khatami, who advocated dialogue between the Iranian and the
American people.
</P>
<P>
Several American delegations including wrestling teams visited
Iran during the past one year and they were warmly welcomed
by the Iranian people.
</P>
<P>
Kayhan also criticized the Iranian Foreign Ministry for
claiming that it had no information about the presence in Iran of
the American visitors, who were labeled by Iranian hardliners
as "spies."
</P>
<P>
The American delegation was under the escort of some
officials from the Iranian Foreign Ministry, who were also
arranging meetings for the Americans with some senior Iranian
officials, including a minister, the daily said.
</P>
<P>
There was no report about when the Americans arrived in
Iran. Iranian dailies said that the Americans came to Iran as
tourists, but some of them were members of the Central
Intelligence Agency.

<HEADLINE> New Dispute Occurs over Alleged Iraqi Documents </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, November 22 (Xinhua) -- A new dispute reared up
between Iraq and U.N. weapons inspectors over alleged secret
documents of chemical and biological weapons Baghdad was accused
of hiding.
</P>
<P>
The conflict came only one week after Iraq resumed full and
unconditional cooperation with the U.N. inspectors, averting a
punishing U.S. military strike to force Baghdad's compliance.
</P>
<P>
Chief U.N. arms inspector Richard Butler said he has written
three letters since last Tuesday to Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister
Tariq Aziz, demanding documents withheld by Iraq concerning its
chemical and biological programs.
</P>
<P>
In its reply, the Iraqi government termed as "provocative
rather than professional" the requests made by Butler, executive
chairman of the U.N. Special Commission (UNSCOM) in charge of
dismantling Iraq's weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
Aziz told reporters on Sunday that Butler was used as a tool of
"creating new crisis" with the aim of undermining the efforts
toward a Security Council comprehensive review of Iraq's
compliance with the relevant U.N. resolutions.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the documents requested by Butler, Aziz said some
of the alleged documents were related to national security and
some simply did not exist. "How can Iraq provide those documents
that did not exist?" he asked.
</P>
<P>
He added that Iraq will publish those letters between the Iraqi
government and Butler on weapons inspections in order to clarify
the truth.
</P>
<P>
He reaffirmed that Iraq was committed to its promises and was
willing to cooperate fully with UNSCOM.
</P>
<P>
Iraq's official media strongly accused Butler Sunday of trying
to create new pretexts for U.S. military attack against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Washington has said if it received a "negative answer" from
Iraq on the weapons inspections, it is well prepared for a
military attack, without prior warning.
</P>
<P>
Despite the conflicts over secret documents, the routine work
of weapon inspections proceeded smoothly since Wednesday with the
cooperation from the Iraqi side.
</P>
<P>
Diplomats here said the weapons inspection work "becomes more
sensitive than ever" following the latest crisis and "any
misconduct would trigger new crisis," as neither side was willing
to make any compromise.
</P>
<P>
Baghdad halted cooperation with UNSCOM on October 31,
triggering the standoff in which the U.S. threatened the use of
force against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
On November 15, Baghdad backed down at the last minute by
agreeing to unconditional resumption of cooperation with
U.N. weapons inspectors.
</P>
<P>
The weapons inspectors resumed inspection work on Wednesday
after returning to Baghdad on Tuesday.

<P>
BAGHDAD, November 22 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi Foreign Minister
Mohammed Saeed al-Sahhaf said Sunday that Iraq has fully
implemented the requirements in the U.N. resolutions and turned
over all documents available to the U.N. weapons inspectors.
</P>
<P>
Al-Sahhaf said at a press conference that Iraq had handed over
all documents available, or 2.188 million documents, to the U.N.
Special Commission and the International Atomic Energy Agency
(IAEA) in the past seven year and a half years.
</P>
<P>
Some 1.5 million documents had been turned over to the IAEA
during the period, he added.
</P>
<P>
On chief U.N. weapons inspector Richard Butler's requests of
handing over more documents, al-Sahhaf said it was politically
motivated and "barraging Iraq with demands for imaginary
documents."
</P>
<P>
"How can Iraq hand over the documents that did not exist?" he
asked.
</P>
<P>
The documents have emerged as a new contentious core in the
dispute between Iraq and UNSCOM after Baghdad rescinded its
October 31 decision and resumed cooperation with the commission,
which oversees Iraq's disarmament.
</P>
<P>
Al-Sahhaf blamed the U.S. and Britain for distorting the truth
and provoking the lastest confrontation.
</P>
<P>
He said Iraq has fully complied with relevant U.N. resolutions
and the Security Council should go ahead to have a comprehensive
review on Iraq's progress on eradicating weapons of mass
destruction, as required in U.N. resolutions on Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
Iraq announced to halt all the activities of UNSCOM on October
31 after the Security Council refused to concede to Iraq's demand
that the council set a timetable for lifting the devastating
sanctions against it.
</P>
<P>
The council maintains that the sanctions, imposed on Iraq
following its invasion of Kuwait in August 1990, will not be
lifted until UNSCOM certifies that Iraq has eliminated all its
banned weapons.
</P>
<P>
Iraq backed down Saturday last week and offered full
cooperation with UNSCOM when the U.S. was on its course to launch
a airstrike against it.

<HEADLINE> Jordan Gets Syrian Nod to Build Dam Along Yarmouk </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, November 22 (Xinhua) -- Jordanian Minister of Water
and Irrigation Hani Malki said here Sunday that Syria has agreed
with Jordan's plan to build a dam on the Yarmouk River to divert
and store water for the kingdom.
</P>
<P>
Syria also promised to help Jordan clear all the obstacles
that might jeopardize the plan, the official Radio Jordan quoted
Malki as saying.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was reached during a bilateral meeting held here
from Saturday to Sunday to settle the water issues, said Malki.
</P>
<P>
According to a 1995 agreement supervised by the Arab League,
Jordan's annual share of the water of the Yarmouk River stands at
330 million cubic meters and Syria's at 90 million cubic meters.
</P>
<P>
However, Jordan complained that the annual flow of the Yarmouk
River into Jordan decreased by a large margin as Syria in recent
years set up more than 30 ditches and pumping facilities along the
river's tributaries in its territory to divert and store water.
</P>
<P>
Syria, in the upper reaches of the river, currently gets 220
million cubic meters of water from Yarmouk each year, the radio
said.
</P>
<P>
Jordan, in the lower reaches, insists that it has not got its
full water share from the river for years.

<HEADLINE> Mbeki's Office Denies New Cabinet Line-up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, November 22 (Xinhua) -- South African Deputy
President Thabo Mbeki's office Sunday dismissed speculation in
newspapers on the likely line-up of his new cabinet after 1999
general elections.
</P>
<P>
South African Press Association quoted Ronnie Mamoepa,
spokesman for Mbeki, as saying that it was too early for
speculation in this regard.
</P>
<P>
Mbeki left Saturday for a three-nation trip to Russia, Sweden
and France.
</P>
<P>
Decisions on a post-Nelson Mandela era would be made by the
new president, said Mamoepa, who is in Mbeki's company.
</P>
<P>
Mbeki, chairman of the ruling African National Congress, has
been highly expected to be elected as president of South Africa
in next year's election.
</P>
<P>
Local newspaper the City Press Sunday tipped Health Minister
Nkosazana Zuma as the next deputy president once Mbeki assumed
the presidency.
</P>
<P>
The Sunday Independent also picked Home Affairs Minister
Mangosuthu Buthelezi as the next possible deputy president after
an expected major cabinet reshuffle straight after the election
in which only about half of the present cabinet members were
expected to remain.
</P>
<P>
The two newspapers suggested that planning had begun for the
Mbeki cabinet and likely contenders were already jostling for the
positions.

his condition has improved markedly, Chad's state radio quoted a
statement from the presidency in N'djamena as saying Sunday.

</P>
<P>
The statement said that Deby had caught a chill during a visit
to the desert town of Agadez in neighboring Niger on November 14.

counterpart Aguiar Mazula.
</P>
<P>
In his written speech delivered at the airport, Chi said China

<HEADLINE> Iraq Says It Has Handed Over All Documents </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, November 22 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi Foreign Minister
Mohammed Saeed al-Sahhaf said here Sunday that Iraq has handed
over all available documents to the U.N. Special Commission
(UNSCOM) in charge of disarmament in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to a press conference on Sunday evening, Sahhaf said
Iraq had handed over a total of 2.188 million documents to UNSCOM
and the International Atomic Energy Agency in the past seven and a
half year.
</P>
<P>
He elaborated that the documents covered the areas of missiles,
chemical and biological weapons.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi minister dismissed UNSCOM Chairman Richard Butler's
allegation that Iraq had not handed over documents as "completely
unfounded" and "politically motivated."
</P>
<P>
He said Butler's allegation was "a new tactic in order to put
obstacles and create problems" and "an attempt to obscure the
work, to mix the cards in order to prevent us and the Security
Council from going ahead to implement the comprehensive review."
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council has pledged that once Iraq has
provided full cooperation with U.N. arms inspectors, the Council
will conduct a comprehensive review of Iraq's progress in
disarmament.
</P>
<P>
"Recently after we resumed cooperation with UNSCOM and the
IAEA on the 14th of November, We are witnessing again a
savage campaign of disinformation, disinforming the international
public opinion," said Sahhaf.
</P>
<P>
In reply to a question from Xinhua correspondent, Sahhaf
said that Iraq just wanted to explain the truth concerning the
issue of document to the fair-minded observers in the world,
and that those who distorted facts should be responsible for
any possible crisis.
</P>
<P>
He blamed the United States and Britain for "distoring the
truth" and fabricating the lastest weapons inspections crisis.
</P>
<P>
Sahhaf stressed that Iraq had fully complied with relevant
U.N. resolutions and the Security Council should go ahead to
honor its own commitment toward Iraq.
</P>
<P>
He said UNSCOM'S work should be concentrated on the real
issues, issues contained in a working program last June which
was agreed upon between Iraq and UNSCOM.
</P>
<P>
"We think the right way is that they (UNSCOM) stop
pushing things to go to a vicious circle and to adhere fully
and sincerely to the objective work in order to see, from
their viewpoints, what are the remaining issues in order to
solve them," said Sahhaf.

<HEADLINE> Iran Confiscates 110 Tonnes of Narcotics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, November 22 (Xinhua) -- Iran has confiscated 110 tonnes
of various narcotics since the beginning of this Iranian calendar
year starting on March 20, 1998, a senior Iranian anti-drug
official said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Mohammad Fallah, secretary of Iran's anti-drug headquarters,
made the remarks at an anti-drug seminar held in Mahmoudabad in
northern Mazadaran province, the official news agency IRNA
reported.
</P>
<P>
Fallah said that 2,575 Iranian anti-drug personnel were
martyred during campaigns against drug trafficking since the
Islamic Revolution in 1979.
</P>
<P>
Iran started its strict anti-drug campaigns in 1989 after the
Iranian Majlis (parliament) passed a law allowing for death
penalty for those caught with more than five kilograms of opium or
above 30 grams of heroin.
</P>
<P>
It is not clear how many drug smugglers have been executed
since the law took effect.
</P>
<P>
Fallah said that more than 100,000 people are jailed for
drug-related reasons.
</P>
<P>
But, he said, the country cannot arrest more drug-related
criminals because there is no enough rooms for the convicted.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Head of Iran's Prisons Organization Morteza
Bakhtiyari told the seminar that every prisoner in Iran only has a
space of 2.5 square meters while it should be 17.5 square meters
according to international standard.
</P>
<P>
He said that there are 170,000 prisoners in Iran.

JERUSALEM, November 12 (Xinhua) -- Israeli troops Sunday
continued the first-phase redeployment in the West Bank under
the terms of the Wye accord signed between Israel and the
Palestinians last month.
</P>
<P>
Voice of Palestinian Radio said that several towns and
villages surrounding the West Bank city of Tulkarem were
transferred to full Palestinian control.
</P>
<P>
Mass celebrations were also held as the Palestinian security
forces were deployed in these areas.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli first-phase withdrawal from parts of the West Bank
began last Friday and is expected to be wrapped up on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Two percent of the West Bank will go from Area C, which is
under exclusive Israeli control, to jointly administered Area
B. And 7.1 percent will go from Area B to exclusively
Palestinian-controlled Area A.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Palestinian Civil Affairs Minister Jamil Tarif said
on Sunday that the civil administration has been transferred to
the Palestinian National Authority (PNA) in the areas which turned
from Area C to Area B.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, Israel is to have carried out two more
pullbacks by late January, giving the PNA joint or sole
jurisdiction over 40 percent of the West Bank.

<HEADLINE> UK Minister Confident EU Beef Ban to be Lifted </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 22 (Xinhua) -- Britain's Agriculture Minister
Nick Brown said on Sunday he was confident that the EU ban on
British beef exports was about to be lifted.
</P>
<P>
He said he had "the support of the majority of the other
agriculture ministers" who will vote on removing the export ban at
an European Union meeting in Brussels on Monday. The ban was
imposed three years ago amid fears of contamination of BSE or 'mad
cow' disease in Britain.
</P>
<P>
Brown told the BBC TV's On The Record program that he expected
British farmers would be exporting deboned beef by February or
March if the ban is lifted and final commission inspections of
British beef are satisfactory.
</P>
<P>
Although the government has taken a number of steps to raise
public confidence in British beef since the BSE crisis, including
the slaughter of millions of cattle, Brown acknowledged that
consumers in Europe may still be reluctant to buy British.
</P>
<P>
He added that the UK's beef exporters had lost out to other
European traders over the last three years. "There are still
normal trading obstacles to be overcome and that is not going to
be easy," he said.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the European Commission, Gerry Kiely, said
that, following the advice of senior vets, a majority now
supported a lifting of the embargo on British beef.
</P>
<P>
"I would be fairly certain that we will at least have the same
countries supporting the measure as supported it at the level of
the civil service and that would allow the commission to take the
decision," said Kiely.

<HEADLINE> Yeltsin, Jiang Hold Informal Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, November 23 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
and Chinese President Jiang Zemin met here Monday in their first
ever informal summit.
</P>
<P>
The "no-tie" meeting was held at the Central Clinical Hospital,
where Yeltsin was hospitalized as a result of pneumonia.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders exchanged views on bilateral relations and
issues of common concern in a friendly and unconstrained
atmosphere, and achieved positive and important results.
</P>
<P>
The presidents expressed their satisfaction with the healthy
and stable development of bilateral ties in the past two years
since the establishment of the strategic partnership between the
two countries in April 1996.
</P>
<P>
This was the sixth summit between the two heads of state. Jiang
visited Russia previously in 1994 and 1997, while Yeltsin visited
China in 1992, 1996 and 1997.
</P>
<P>
During their meeting Monday, Yeltsin and Jiang agreed that the
mechanisms of exchange of visits by heads of state, the regular
meetings between premiers and various joint committees should
continue to play their role in pushing forward bilateral
cooperation in various fields to a new century.
</P>
<P>
Jiang extended his invitation for Yeltsin to visit China next
year for their second informal summit. Yeltsin happily accepted it.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji is scheduled to pay an official
visit to Russia next spring to further enhance bilateral
collaboration in economics, trade, and science and technology.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the two countries will also increase
people-to-people exchanges.
</P>
<P>
On border issues, Jiang noted that the two countries'
demarcated borders in both the western and eastern sections have
been marked on the site for the first time, an historic
contribution to the development of good neighborly relations
between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Jiang said, the agreements reached on the reduction
of military presence along their common borders and other
confidence-building measures represent a brand new mode of border
security arrangement on the Asian continent, which will contribute
to regional peace and stability.
</P>
<P>
Jiang expressed his appreciation for Yeltsin's contributions in
this regard.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin, for his part, spoke highly of the important
achievements made in the process of solving the border issue. He
said the two countries' common efforts are conducive to the
maintenance of lasting peace and stability along their common
borders.
</P>
<P>
He described the new mode of border security arrangement as
unique in the world.
</P>
<P>
On the Taiwan issue, Jiang said that after their meeting, the
two countries will sign a joint communique, in which the Russian
side further clearly states its stance on Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
It will neither support "Two Chinas", or "One China, One
Taiwan," nor will it back Taiwan's independence or its bid to join
the United Nations or other international bodies of sovereign
states. Russia also promises in the joint communique that it will
not conduct arms sales to Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
"I greatly appreciate the support by Your Excellency and the
Russian government for China's cause of unification," Jiang told
Yeltsin. "China likewise resolutely supports Russia's national
unification and territorial integrity."
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin said that Russia will unswervingly stick to its one
China policy with no deviations whatsoever. Russia only maintains
unofficial economic and cultural ties with Taiwan, he added.
</P>
<P>
Jiang arrived here Sunday evening on a four-day visit. Besides
Moscow, he will also visit Novosibirsk.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese president is also expected to hold meetings Monday
with Russian State Duma Speaker Gennady Seleznyov, Federation
Council Chairman Yegor Stroyev and Prime Minister Yevgeny
Primakov.

<HEADLINE> Border Guards Promote Sino-Russian Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARBIN, November 23 (Xinhua) -- The time when routine meetings
between Chinese and Russian border guards were rigid and strictly
business are becoming a distant memory.
</P>
<P>
"We now talk about how to promote Sino-Russian friendship and
border trade, and not disagreements or boder disputes," said Shi
Yejian, the director of public security along the 800-km border in
north China's Heilongjiang Province.
</P>
<P>
Golbach, commander of the Russian Far-Eastern Frontier
Command Area, described Shi as "our most honorable guest and
friend.
</P>
<P>
"Everybody in our command area knows his name," said Golbach,
who has worked closely with his Chinese counterpart for over four
years.
</P>
<P>
The long Sino-Russian border has witnessed growing friendship
and trade along with advancement of China's reform and opening up,
and especially since the establishment of the strategic partnership
between China and Russia.
</P>
<P>
"It takes less than 30 seconds to admit a Russian visitor,"
according to Qin Chenglu, chief of the frontier checkpoint in
Shuifenhe, a small Chinese town bordering on Russia.
</P>
<P>
Russian border checkpoints formerly opened 5-6 hours per day
and fell short of meeting the needs of increasing commodities and
personnel flowing between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The Heilongjiang Frontier Bureau and the Russian Far-Eastern
Frontier Command Area held a number of meetings earlier this year
and Russian side agreed to open checkpoints by an additional four
hours each day.
</P>
<P>
Shuifenhe, a small town with 42,000 residents, now enjoys
prosperity resulting from peace in the border area. The town
boasts well over 3,000 mobile phones, and readily accessible
pay telephones enable local residents to conveniently place calls
around the world. The city's 1996 trade volume with Russia
hit 540 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The Heilongjiang Frontier Bureau and checkpoint officials have
held 1,422 meetings with their Russian counterparts in recent
years, in addition to numerous telephone and written
exchanges.

<HEADLINE> Russia, China to Continue Support to U.N. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, November 23 (Xinhua) -- China and Russia will continue
their support to the United Nations and work to strengthen its
role in international affairs, visiting Chinese President Jiang
Zemin and Russian President Boris Yeltsin said here Monday.
</P>
<P>
In a joint statement issued after their informal meeting, the
two heads of state reaffirmed that the United Nations plays a
kernel role in international affairs.
</P>
<P>
They believed that actions through the United Nations can more
fully and evidently reflect the growing potential of world
multipolarization, and gradually rule out moves based on
unilateralism or narrow nationalism.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, the policy to support and fully consolidate the role
of the United Nations represents one of the main components of
the Chinese and Russian foreign diplomatic strategies, the joint
statement said.
</P>
<P>
The statement called for earnest and rational reforms of the
U.N., which will not only help preserve all the U.N. operational
mechanisms proven to be effective, but further raise its work
efficiency while taking the world reality into full consideration.
</P>
<P>
This, the statement pointed out, will help enhance the U.N.'s
prestige and functions.
</P>
<P>
It went on to say that the improvement of the work of the U.N.
Security Council occupies a special position in the U.N. reforms.
</P>
<P>
The leading responsibility the U.N. Charter entrusted to the
U.N. Security Council is to safeguard world peace and security,
and under no circumstances should this be questioned, the
statement noted.
</P>
<P>
Any attempt to bypass the Security Council will lead to the
destruction of the existing peace-keeping mechanisms and a chaos
in international affairs, and create a reality in which power
overrides the international law, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The conception of an expanded U.N. Security Council should
proceed from the strict observance of the equitable principle of
geo-allocation and seek broad agreement, most ideally, the
unanimity among the U.N. members reached through consultation.

<HEADLINE> South Asian Nations Conclude 3rd Round Trade Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, November 23 (Xinhua) -- A SAARC (South Asian
Association for Regional Cooperation) group concluded here Monday
the third round of trade negotiations under the SAARC Preferential
Trading Arrangement (SAPTA) and decided to launch the fourth round
as early as possible.
</P>
<P>
During the third meeting of the Inter-Governmental Group (IGG)
on Trade Liberalization held on November 21-23 at the
Kathmandu-based SAARC Secretariat, representatives from the SAARC
member states had detailed discussions with a view to identifying
items which are actively traded or likely to be actively traded so
that concessions may be given to such products, the SAARC
Secretariat said in a press release.
</P>
<P>
At the 10th SAARC summit held in July in Colombo, Sri Lanka,
the SAARC leaders decided to conclude the third round of trade
talks, which should have ended in January this year, before the
21st session of the SAARC Council of Ministers to be held in
February 1999.
</P>
<P>
"The conclusion of the third round at this stage reflects the
commitment of the member states to strengthen and carry forward
the SAPTA process," the press release said.
</P>
<P>
The first two rounds of trade negotiations under the SAPTA put
2,228 items of products on the Consolidated National Schedules of
Concessions, which offer tariff cuts ranging from 7.5 percent to
100 percent for the SAARC member countries -- Bangladesh, Bhutan,
India, the Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka.
</P>
<P>
The seven countries decided to set up a South Asian Free Trade
Area (SAFTA) by the year 2001, but the leaders at the 10th summit
deferred the deadline indefinitely.
</P>
<P>
"From the fourth round onward negotiations would preferably be
conducted chapter-wise or on sectoral basis or across-the-board in
order to make more substantive progress on trade negotiations
within the region. The fourth round would also specifically start
focusing on SAFTA," the press release added.

<HEADLINE> Jiang Meets Russian State Duma Speaker </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, November 23 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin
said here Monday that the new type of state-to-state relations
between China and Russia will continue to develop no matter what
happens on the international arena.
</P>
<P>
Jiang told Russian State Duma Speaker Gennady Seleznyov that
the two countries' relations based on equal treatment and mutually
beneficial cooperation not only serve the fundamental interests of
the two countries and two peoples, but will also contribute to
regional and global peace and development.
</P>
<P>
Seleznyov, for his part, expressed his confidence that Jiang's
current visit will push bilateral relations to a new stage.
</P>
<P>
He said Russia hopes to maintain and further its friendly ties
with China and to achieve even greater results in their strategic
partnership.
</P>
<P>
Seleznyov, who visited China last October, spoke highly of
China's tremendous achievements in the past two decades.
</P>
<P>
"Seeing is believing," Seleznyov said, adding that Russia can
learn from China's experience in its reforms, although it cannot
apply China's practices mechanically.
</P>
<P>
Jiang, who arrived here Sunday evening on a four-day visit to
Russia, held his first ever informal summit earlier Monday with
Russian President Boris Yeltsin at the Central Clinical Hospital,
where Yeltsin was treated with antibiotics for pneumonia.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese president told the Russian lawmakers that Beijing
has been supporting the two parliaments in their efforts to
develop friendly relations, and views parliamentary exchanges as
an important part of bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
With common efforts, Jiang said, exchanges and cooperation
between the Chinese National People's Congress and the Russian
State Duma has been developing smoothly, and play a positive role
in strengthening mutual understanding, expanding common grounds,
enhancing friendship and consolidating cooperation between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
He thanked the State Duma, Russia's lower house of parliament,
and friends from the various political parties present at the
meeting for their unremitting efforts in promoting the sound and
smooth development of the Sino-Russian ties.
</P>
<P>
Jiang expressed the hope that greater contributions will be
made to the development of bilateral ties and their smooth
transition to the coming 21st century.
</P>
<P>
Recalling his years' studying and working in Russia as well as
his frequent visits here in the past few years, Jiang praised
Russia's long history, splendid culture and ingenious people.
</P>
<P>
A nation with such high quality represents the hope of the
country, Jiang said, adding that China, as a friendly neighbor,
sincerely wishes Russia prosperity and its people happiness.
</P>
<P>
Blessed with the presence of such a great people, Russia will
surely achieve economic prosperity and national rejuvenation,
Jiang said.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Soldier Killed in South Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, November 23 (Xinhua) -- One Israeli soldier was killed
and two others wounded in south Lebanon when Lebanese guerrillas
launched an attack on an Israeli position Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli position at Dashi village, just outside the
Israeli-occupied zone in south Lebanon, was hit by Lebanese
guerrillas with grenades and mortar shells.
</P>
<P>
The latest death toll has raised to 16 the number of Israeli
soldiers killed in south Lebanon since the start of this
year. Some 96 others were wounded in the same period.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, two soldiers of the Israeli allied
South Lebanon Army (SLA) were injured by guerrilars in another
attack on an Israeli position at Aley Taher outside the border
strip.
</P>
<P>
No groups have so far claimed responsibility for the attacks.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up a self-declared security zone in south Lebanon in
1985 with the claimed aim of protecting its north from
cross-border attacks by Lebanese guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
Since then, Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God, has been
spearheading a guerrilla war to oust Israeli occupation troops and
their allied SLA.
</P>
<P>
In response to the attacks, Israeli warplanes fired two
air-to-surface rockets on suspected guerrillas' targets on the
edge of the zone. But no reports about the casualties were
available.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, three Lebanese civilians, including one
eight-year-old child, were seriously wounded in Israeli artillery
shelling on Kfar Tibnit village in the central sector of the
zone.

<HEADLINE> Door for Dialogue With Myanmar Govt Always Open: NLD </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, November 23 (Xinhua) -- The National League for
Democracy (NLD) will always open its door for dialogue with the
Myanmar military government, but will not accept preconditions
especially in the absence of her, said Aung San Suu Kyi, general
secretary of the NLD, Monday.
</P>
<P>
Aung San Suu Kyi made the remarks at a press conference given
at the NLD Headquarters here Monday.
</P>
<P>
Among those present were nine of the 10 members of the
"Committee Representing the People's Parliament Elected in the
1990 Multi-Party Democracy General Election" formed in September.
The remaining one is said to have been detained by the
authorities.
</P>
<P>
The committee reiterated that it will continue to work for the
convening of the "People's Parliament" and draw up the new "state
constitution".
</P>
<P>
Distributed at the press conference was also a letter sent to
Senior General Than Shwe, chairman of the Myanmar State Peace and
Development Council (SPDC), and U Ba Htay, chairman of the
Multi-Party Democracy General Elections Commission.
</P>
<P>
The letter covered the matter of the recent disbandment of
NLD's township organizational committees, saying that the
dissolution is illegal.
</P>
<P>
The letter recalled that the former State Law and Order
Restoration Council (now SPDC) passed the Political Parties
Registration Act on September 27, 1988, pointing out that "a body
that has passed a law must itself abide by the provisions of the
said law, if the law is to have beneficial effect and gain public
respectability. Law makers should not be law breakers".
</P>
<P>
The letter also said that "the NLD continues to pursue the high
ideals of democracy and human rights amidst the myriad
difficulties created by the authorities. The NLD protests strongly
against the coercive actions taken by the intelligence services to
bring about the illegal disbandment of the township committees and
urges the authorities to bring an end forthwith to such
activities."
</P>
<P>
However, the government had said in a statement that "it has
not been unwilling to extend the olive branch to the NLD. It is
the NLD that has spurned the government's offer to meet and it is
Aung San Suu Kyi who seeks to confront the authorities at every
turn."
</P>
<P>
The government's statement added that "the NLD could face
serious action if it tried to convene the People's Parliament
unilaterally," and "if such an action is to be implemented by an
individual political party, it can lead to the NLD making itself
the parallel government which no government in the world would
accept."
</P>
<P>
The press conference was also attended by foreign diplomats and
 correspondents.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Women Use Cosmetics Since Ancient Times </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, November 23 (Xinhua) -- While modern females love to use
brand name perfume and cosmetics made in France, ancient Chinese
women were using make-up long before the appearance of ancient
Roman Empire on the European Continent.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a symposium on Tang Culture, Lu Xiuwen, an expert
with the Dunhuang Research Institute, said that Chinese women
started to use make-up as early as the Warring States Period
(475-221 B.C.).
</P>
<P>
Lu has studied numerous frescos at the famous Dunhuang Grottos
in northwest China's Gansu Province and noted that a large
number of the works depict make-up storage.
</P>
<P>
"Chu Tze" (poetry from the Kingdom of Chu) records how
women during the Warring States Period marked their long and thin
eyebrows with a black color.
</P>
<P>
Lu pointed out that eyebrow make-up was an important beauty
tool used by ancient Chinese woman. Chinese women living during
the Qin Dynasty (221-207 B.C.) paid greater attention to
cosmetics. Many woman would pluck their eyebrows and then use
various colors to draw their favorite shapes.
</P>
<P>
Chinese women in pursity of beauty were not satisfied with
simply eyebrow make-up. Lu noted that hair dyeing as we know it
today actually originated with colorful eyebrow make-up popular
during the Northern and Southern Dynasties (420-550).
</P>
<P>
Women living during the Northern Dynasty dyed their eyebrows
yellow, with some women placing colored paper in the shape of
flower on their foreheads.
</P>
<P>
The use of pigment to dye eyebrows gained popularity later in
the Tang Dynasty (618-907), which, according to Lu, can be seen in
a number of frescos in the Dunhuang Grottos.

<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, November 23 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh and India signed
agreed-upon minutes Monday evening following three days of talks
covering border-related issues.
</P>
<P>
The minutes were initialed by Bangladeshi Home Secretary Safiur
Rahman and his Indian counterpart B.P. Singh, who arrived here
Friday at head of a seven-member delegation.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters after signing the minutes, Singh said the
two sides had had a very positive and constructive dialogue toward
solving the existing border problems between the countries.
</P>
<P>
"All criminals, smugglers, touts and illegal immigrants will be
dealt with seriously," he said.
</P>
<P>
On the issue of India's recent attempt to push "Indian
nationals" into Bangladesh, Singh said, "There will be no push-in.
Problems will be solved through bilateral negotiations."
</P>
<P>
For his part, Rahman said the two sides discussed measures for
curbing all cross-border crimes, such as illegal immigrants, drug
trafficking, children and women trafficking and smuggling.
</P>
<P>
The two countries would take steps to complete the demarcation
of a nearly 6.5-kilometer stretch of border which remained
unfinished, he added. The two countries have a common border of
over 4,000 kilometers.
</P>
<P>
At a news briefing Sunday, the Bangladeshi home secretary said
the two sides had agreed to solve all the existing border problems
through mutual discussion.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on the push-in issue, he said that there was no
Bangladeshi illegally staying in India.
</P>
<P>
"If there is any, there is also a process to repatriate them -
they cannot be pushed into our territory through the borders," he
said, adding that Bangladesh is ready to take back any
Bangladeshis illegally staying in India after genuine verification
of their identity.
</P>
<P>
On the issue of trans-border insurgency, Rahman said he had
assured the Indian side of not giving shelter to the Indian
terrorists in Bangladesh.

<HEADLINE> HK Explores Outlets for Waste Paper </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, November 23 (Xinhua) -- The Environmental Protection
 Department of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR)
is exploring both local and overseas outlets for recyclable waste
 paper in an effort to help paper recovery programs and campaigns
affected by the recent closure here of a major paper recycling
company.
</P>
<P>
Principal Environmental Protection Officer Mamie Lau said
Concordia Paper Limited consumed 14,000 tons monthly, or some 24
percent, of locally collected waste paper. In the short term its
closure might have some effect to the outlet of the waste paper
collected.
</P>
<P>
The EPD is now contacting local recycling companies to explore
whether they could absorb the recycling share by Concordia and
also waste paper collection companies for exporting more waste
paper overseas.
</P>
<P>
"If paper recovery program and campaign organizers have
difficulties in finding outlets for the paper recovered, they can
contact EPD for assistance," she said.
</P>
<P>
On the future development of local recycling industry, Lau said
that the SAR government is working to establish more sustainable
outlets, both locally and overseas, and will continue to explore
more measures to help the local recycling industry.
</P>
<P>
She said the government has already implemented a number of
measures to assist the recycling industry. "As the recycling
business has a rather low profit margin, and land cost in Hong
Kong is comparatively high, suitable sites are leased exclusively
to the recycling industry at an affordable rent."
</P>
<P>
"The government has initiated material recovery projects to
provide assistance in the collection, storage and transportation
of recyclable to recyclers," she said.
</P>
<P>
Lau said the government will also consider other financial
incentives to promote recycling activities.

<HEADLINE> China Witnesses Slight Decline in Foreign Investment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 23 (Xinhua) -- The number of foreign-funded
firms and their investment in the first 10 months of the year
dropped slightly on last year's period, according to figures
released today by the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic
Cooperation (MOFTEC).
</P>
<P>
MOFTEC statistics show that the number of approved foreign
enterprises fell by 4.19 percent to 16,168 for the period, with
contracted investment dropping by 1.46 percent to 34.911
billion US dollars.
</P>
<P>
However, the used funds hit 35.91 billion US dollars, up 0.87
percent on the 1997 period.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference, Assistant Minister
Ma Xiuhong attributed the declines to the negative effect of the
Asian financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
Investments from Asia accounted for more than 80 percent of the
total foreign investments in China by the end of 1997, said Ma,
adding that the financial crisis has inevitably reduced relevant
investments.
</P>
<P>
She pointed out, however, that this year's sharp increase of
investments from the European Union and North America has at least
to a certain extent reduced the impact of the loss.
</P>
<P>
Investment in the sectors of agriculture, basic industry and
infrastructure have continued to grow this year in spite of the
decrease in foreign investment, said Ma.
</P>
<P>
In addition, major multinational companies have increased their
investments in China.
</P>
<P>
"The scale of foreign investment in China has basically been
maintained and the investment structure has improved during the
year," said Ma. "Related factors are in compliance with China's
economic growth."
</P>
<P>
Ma said that China will adopt "appropriate measures" to promote
foreign investment in 1999, with measures focusing on areas such
as improvements in the "soft environment" and both management and
legal affairs.
</P>
<P>
She stressed that foreign investors recognize that China has
maintained its opening policy, enjoys continuing economic growth and
stable political and economic environments, and has
refused to devalue its currency.

<HEADLINE> Yeltsin's Working Schedule Changed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, November 23 (Xinhua) -- The working schedule of Russian
President Boris Yeltsin has been changed due to his illness, and
some of the international meetings planned in this month have been
canceled, the Interfax news agency reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
Presidential spokesman Dmitri Yakushkin was cited as saying
that pneumonia patients are recommended to spend eight to ten days
in the hospital to recover, but it is impossible to say how long
Yeltsin will have to stay in the hospital.
</P>
<P>
On the eve of the first informal meeting with visiting Chinese
President Jiang Zemin, Yeltsin was taken to the Central Clinical
Hospital for pneumonia on Monday, when his temperature hit 38.9
degrees.
</P>
<P>
"Today his temperature is normal again," Yakushkin
said. Yeltsin will have to hold a number of working meetings in
the hospital, he added.
</P>
<P>
On the meeting between Yeltsin and Jiang Zemin which ended at
12:00 local time (0900 GMT) on Monday in the hospital, Yakushkin
said "it was a good working meeting." The agenda was somewhat
reduced because Yeltsin's pneumonia takes its toll, but every
subject was covered, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
According to him, the Kremlin intends to speak openly about the
president's health to avoid ambiguity.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 23 (Xinhua) -- Participants in the '1999
Kunming World Horticulture Exposition are expected to see a
flower-blooming Yunnan and experience the hospitality of the local
people as well as the sound social environment.
</P>
<P>
The Yunnan provincial government held a meeting today in

<HEADLINE> Hendry Keen on Blackburn Rovers Job </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 23 (Xinhua) -- Glasgow Rangers defender Colin
Hendry has indicated his interest in a possible return to
Blackburn as their new manager, according to the BBC on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Scotland international left Ewood Park only three months
ago, but is seen as a leading candidate to take over in the wake
of Roy Hodgson's departure following Saturday's home defeat by
Southampton, a result which left them on the bottom of the FA
Premier League table.
</P>
<P>
"It's all hypothetical but I'm flattered to be spoken about in
connection with the job. The funny thing is I've only just made
it back to Scotland and then something like this comes along to
test the water," Hendry said.
</P>
<P>
"I've never really hidden my ambition to become involved in
coaching and management, but really I was expecting something
later in may career," he added.
</P>
<P>
Tony Parkes has been put in temporary charge by Blackburn and
he wasted no time in confirming Hodgson had been sacked. The club
had insisted the decision was taken by "mutual consent".
</P>
<P>
Rangers vice-chairman Donald Findlay has confirmed they are
willing to discuss the situation if Blackburn make an approach.
</P>
<P>
"I have no reason to suppose Colin Hendry is anything other
than committed to us, but I could understand a sentimental
attachment to at some point return to Blackburn," he said.
</P>
<P>
Hendry was a popular figure among Blackburn fans, and has no
fears about beginning a managerial career with such a
high-profile job.
</P>
<P>
"There's no time like the present, though I don't know what
Blackburn are thinking at this stage. If I don't try management
I'll always wonder and the question will never be answered," he
added.
</P>
<P>
Former Liverpool boss Roy Evans and Football Association
technical director Howard Wilkinson have also been linked with
the Rovers job.
</P>
<P>
But there appears to be no chance of Kenny Dalglish returning
to the club he led to the Premiership title as he is involved
with a consortium trying to take control of Celtic.
</P>
<P>
Hodgson's assistant, Tony Parkes, has taken over as caretaker
boss - a role he has filled on three previous occasions - but has
already ruled himself out as a candidate for the vacancy.
</P>
<P>
"Tony is in charge of team affairs until a permanent
appointment is made and we are very fortunate to have somebody of
his ability to call on. Tony has the complete confidence of
everyone at the club, especially (club owner) Jack Walker," said
Blackburn chief executive John Williams.
</P>
<P>
Parkes said it had been a "sad weekend" and the club had been
plagued by injuries and debatable refereeing decisions this
season.
</P>
<P>
"Roy wanted more time with the club but did agree that results
had gone badly. Jack Walker wouldn't give him any more time. But
I think Roy would like to make it known that he was sacked. He
would never desert a sinking ship," he added.
</P>
<P>
Blackburn officials are, meanwhile, due to meet Hodgson to
discuss a compensation package.

<TEXT>
<P>
DATONG, November 23 (Xinhua) -- China's first seminar on grotto
tourism closed today in Datong, a historic city in Shaanxi
Province.
</P>
<P>
Officials and experts attending the two-day seminar agreed that
the country's grotto culture has developed into a rare tourism
resource which has attracted large numbers of domestic and foreign
tourists in recent years.
</P>
<P>
"However, cultural relics and tourism departments must extend
great efforts to better protect the grottos from excessive
development since they cannot be reproduced and have deteriorated
over thousands of years of natural changes", according to
participants.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that China has opened 120 grotto sites dating
from the 4th-19th centuries. The most famous grottos are the
Dunhuang Mogao Grottos in Gansu Province, Yungang Grottos in
Datong, Longmen Grottos in Henan Province, Maiji Mountain Grottos
in Gansu Province and Dazu Grottos in Chongqing
Municipality.

<HEADLINE> HK Launches Five-Year Strategy to Promote IT in Education </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, November 23 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region (SAR) government Monday launched a five-year
strategy for promoting information technology (IT) in education so
as to better prepare the schools sector for the future.
</P>
<P>
The government had taken into account the views expressed in an
extensive consultation earlier before taking the move.
</P>
<P>
The document, entitled "Information Technology for Learning in
a New Era: Five-year Strategy 1998/99 to 2002/03", builds on
various measures previously announced which will incur 3,214
million HK dollars (about 412 million U.S. dollars) in capital
cost and 556 million HK dollars (about 71.3 million U.S, dollars)
in annual recurrent cost.
</P>
<P>
They include about 65,000 computers for primary and secondary
schools, some 80,000 training places for teachers, Internet access
for all schools and an IT coordinator per school for 250 schools.
</P>
<P>
Secretary for Education and Manpower Joseph Wong said: "To meet
the challenges of the information age, our students must possess
higher order thinking skills, creativity, abilities to seek,
evaluate, organize and present information, as well as habits of
life-long independent thinking. IT in education plays a key role
in preparing them for tomorrow's world."
</P>
<P>
The campaign aims to turn schools into dynamic and innovative
learning institutions where students can become more motivated,
inquisitive and creative learners; link up students with the vast
network of knowledge and information to enable them to acquire a
broad knowledge base and a global outlook; develop in students'
capabilities to process information effectively and efficiently;
and develop in students the attitude and capability for
independent life-long learning.
</P>
<P>
"However, IT will never replace our teachers' professional
skill as a teacher. It will only serve to enhance it," Wong noted.
</P>
<P>
The success of the strategy depended very much on the
collaboration among all parties concerned, including school heads,
teachers, students, parents, tertiary institutions, the business
community and community bodies, he added.

<HEADLINE> Accidents Cost Billions in Canada </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, November 23 (Xinhua) -- Injuries from accidents that
could have been prevented drain 8.7 billion Canadian dollars( 5.6
billion U.S. dollars) annually from the Canadian economy, a new
study says.
</P>
<P>
More than two million Canadians are injured every year, says
the report being released Monday. Falls, especially among elderly
women, accounted for 41 per cent of the tally, more than double
the number of injuries that result from road accidents.
</P>
<P>
Many of these mishaps could be prevented by better legislation
or product safety and by teaching people how to prepare themselves
to take risks, according to the study, which was commissioned by
the SmartRisk Foundation.
</P>
<P>
The foundation was started in 1992 by Toronto heart surgeon
Robert Conn to deal with the fact that injuries are the leading
cause of death of Canadians up to the age of 44.
</P>
<P>
Researchers found that 4.2 billion Canadian dollars (2.7
billion U.S. dollars) was spent on direct health care for injured
people and that the resulting loss of productivity amounted to 4.5
billion Canadian dollars (2.9 billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The study predicted that 1.7 billion Canadian dollars could be
saved each year by reducing the number of injuries by just 20 per
cent and called for a national strategy to link injury patterns
with prevention measures.

<HEADLINE> China, Russia Call for Mutual Support in Times of Difficulties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, November 23 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Chinese President
Jiang Zemin and Russian President Boris Yeltsin said Monday that
China and Russia should support each other and pull together in
the face of the current financial turmoil.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders expressed the view in the Sino-Russian Joint
Statement released after their informal meeting on Monday.
</P>
<P>
At the turn of the century, the globalization and
regionalization of the world economy are becoming an important
factor that determines the well-being of the world economy, said
the joint statement. Both China and Russia support and actively
take part in the process.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the interdependence of world economies has
reached the stage in which the protection of the economic security
of sovereign states must become a matter of paramount urgency, the
statement said.
</P>
<P>
In this context, what is particularly important is that all
countries concerned should adhere to the principle of mutual
benefit and regional opening-up, it added.
</P>
<P>
The statement called for the elimination of discrimination of
all kinds in international trade and the abandonment of the
attempt to impose, by means of monetary and financial levers,
political or economic conditions on other countries, which are
harmful to their legitimate national interests.
</P>
<P>
The financial crisis that has surfaced in many regions and
countries has borne out the fact that all the countries concerned
should extend mutual support in times of trouble instead of taking
advantage of the hard times to seek private ends.

<HEADLINE> China to Improve Management over NGOs (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 23 (Xinhua) -- A senior Chinese leader said
here today that the booming development of non-government
organizations (NGO) in recent years has in general played a
positive role in the society, but also created some
problems that need to be urgently addressed.
</P>
<P>
Wei Jianxin, a Standing Committee member of the Political
Bureau of the Chinese Communist Party (CPC) Central Committee,
made the remark at a national conference on NGOs and social
stability.
</P>
<P>
"We need to streamline our working system on the management of
NGOs to better maintain the social stability, and to further
strengthen their internal management mechanisms," We said.
</P>
<P>
It was revealed by the Ministry of Civil Affairs that there are
nearly one million NGOs across the country, involving all the
fields of politics, economy, ethnic groups, religions, culture,
sports, health and many others.
</P>
<P>
Wei told the conference to "study the new situations in the
management of NGOs, summerize our successful experience and
clarify the goals and tasks for the future."
</P>
<P>
He said all the localities and related departments "must
enhance understandings, unify our thinking, boost our morale and
coordinate well with each other for the common goal of managing
the NGOs better."

<HEADLINE> Vietnam Reiterates Importance of Agricultural, Rural </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, November 23 (Xinhua) -- The Political Bureau of the
Central Committee of the Communist Party of Vietnam has emphasized
the industrialization and modernization of agricultural production
as Vietnam's most important task in the immediate and long term.
</P>
<P>
Vietnamese Communist Party's daily Nhan Dan (the people) Monday
carried a resolution on the direction, targets and major policies
for agricultural and rural development which was adopted by the
Political Bureau on November 10.
</P>
<P>
The resolution reiterated the importance of the issues of
farmers, agriculture and rural development.
</P>
<P>
Over the past ten years, the resolution said, agricultural
production has grown by 4.3 percent a year on average. The
economic structure in rural areas has also changed by increasing
the ratio of industry and services. Exports of farm, forestry and
fishery products have rapidly increased, becoming a major foreign
currency earner for the country. The farmers' living conditions
have improved remarkably.
</P>
<P>
These achievements have greatly contributed to the national
socio-economic stability and development and reaffirmed the
position of agriculture and rural areas in the country's economy,
the resolution stressed.
</P>
<P>
It, however, pointed out the existing shortcomings that need to
be addressed in order to reap greater success in this field. These
include the slow pace of restructuring, limited application of
scientific and technological advancements, slow development of the
processing industry, and low competitiveness of farm produce.
</P>
<P>
The resolution set the following six objectives in agricultural
development:
</P>
<P>
- Ensuring food security in all circumstances;
</P>
<P>
- Restructuring agricultural development toward
industrialization and modernization to increase the proportion of
processed farm products and earnings from farm produce exports:
</P>
<P>
- Generating more jobs for rural people and accelerating
efforts to reduce poverty in rural areas;
</P>
<P>
- Protecting the environment and curbing unplanned forest
exploitation to increase Vietnam's forest coverage to 43 percent
by 2010;
</P>
<P>
- Improving the efficiency and capacity of the fisheries
sector; and
</P>
<P>
- Strictly implementing the regulations on democracy to ensure
socio-political stability and solidarity in rural areas.

<HEADLINE> Socialists Meet in Geneva to Discuss Globalization </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, November 23 (Xinhua) -- Leaders and delegates of more
than 100 social democratic and labor parties met here Monday for a
two-day meeting to exchange views on how to make global markets
work for all.
</P>
<P>
At the opening session chaired by Pierre Mauroy, president of
the Socialist International and a former French prime minister,
the participants listened to a written message by United Nations
Secretary-General Kofi Annan.
</P>
<P>
In the message, the secretary-general stressed that
globalization needs good governance.
</P>
<P>
"Maximizing the beneficial effects of market forces while
minimizing their negative consequences has always required that
they be coupled with the effective exercise of public authority:
instituting the political and legal frameworks that markets need,
and providing the safeguards against the deleterious effects they
can produce," Annan said.
</P>
<P>
Annan praised the choice of the meeting's theme as
"exceptionally timely and relevant".
</P>
<P>
"I believe that over the long term, globalization will be
positive," he said. "It draws peoples closer together and offers
many of us choices that our grandparents could not even dream
of. It enables us to produce more efficiently and allows some of
us, at least, to improve our quality of life."
</P>
<P>
Noting the fact that the number of poor people are growing and
that the Asian economic crisis has spread to Russia, Annan said
that the international community should not wait helplessly.
</P>
<P>
He called on the international community to deal with the
issues raised by the crisis immediately both locally and
globally.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan's Trade Deficit Reduced by 60 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, November 23 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan's trade deficit was
reduced by over 60 percent during the first quarter of the current
financial year starting from July 1.
</P>
<P>
The trade deficit stood at 356 million U.S. dollars in the
first quarter, showing a decline of 575 million dollars compared

cut down to zero.
</P>
<P>
During the months from July to October this year, Pakistan's
exports were registered at 2.459 billion dollars with imports at
2.815 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The decline of the trade deficit was mainly resulted from the
reduction of imports, the sources said. Imports in the same period
of last year reached 3.664 billion dollars.

<HEADLINE> Congo (K) Rebel Commander Narrowly Escapes Plane </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, November 23 (Xinhua) -- Jean Pierre Ondekane, the
commander of the Congolese rebels fighting to oust President
Laurent Kabila, and top rebel officials have narrowly escaped a
plane crash at Goma Airport, in the east of Democratic Republic
of Congo (DRC).
</P>
<P>
Rwanda News Agency (RNA) quoted rebel-held Radio Goma
monitored in Gisenyi Monday morning as saying that the plane
crash occured Sunday at around 16:30 gmt. Fortunately no one
died.
</P>
<P>
A RNA correspondent who was present at Goma Airport at the
time of the aborted crash, said the accident happened as the
plane, a 727 Boeing, was preparing to take off. Its left wheel
hit a hole near the end of the tarmac, burst immediately and
prevented the airplane from leaving the ground.
</P>
<P>
The pilot managed to halt at 200 meters away in the grass,
where it remained parked even this morning, RNA correspondent
said.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, the right wheel also burst because of the
pressure provoked by flat tire on the left, he said. Immediately
after the burst, a big smoke erupted in both wheels and the wings
of the plane.
</P>
<P>
Radio Goma said the fire was immediately brought under control
by the pilot and the mechanists aboard. The plane, which carried
127 passengers and 3.5 tons of food, was bound for Kisangani, the
second largest city in the north of the vast central African
country.
</P>
<P>
Ondekane reassured the residents that this was not
an assassination attempt on his life.
</P>
<P>
Ondekane and the rebel officials reportedly pursued their trip
to Kisangani this Monday morning in another plane.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa's ANC Welcomes Outcome of Congo (K) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, November 23 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's ruling
African National Congress (ANC) Monday welcomed the decision made
Saturday by the rebel movement in the Democratic Republic of
Congo (DRC) to back the peace process brokered by the Southern
African Development Community (SADC).
</P>
<P>
"The decision of the DRC rebel movement to throw its full
weight behind the peace process, aimed at resolving the political
impasse in the DRC, gives more hope for the full implementation
of the ceasefire agreement," the ANC said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
The party said it remained confident in the ability of the
SADC, the Organization of African Unity (OAU) and the United
Nations to facilitate the peace process.
</P>
<P>
The ANC also rejected criticism that the South African
government took sides in the DRC conflict.
</P>
<P>
SADC Executive Secretary Kaire Mbuende said Saturday although
the two-day meeting in the Botswanan capital of Gaborone ended
inconclusively, it laid a basis for moving the Congolese peace
process forward.
</P>
<P>
The meeting brought together a rebel delegation and
representatives from South Africa, Tanzania and Mozambique, as
well as the OAU and United Nations envoys.
</P>
<P>
A rebel leader, Bizima Karaha, said Saturday his movement
would now embark seriously on the peace process in the DRC, and
was ready to talk to DRC President Laurent Kabila at any time.
</P>
<P>
Several regional peace initiatives have failed to resolve the
crisis in the central African state since it started in early
August, when the Tutsi-led rebels took up arms against Kabila.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe, Angola and Namibia sent troops to the DRC in late
August to prop up Kabila's troops.

<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, November 23 (Xinhua) -- Egypt said on Monday that it is
ready to take part in international forums aimed at seeking ways
of protecting the environment.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the opening session of the 10th Meeting of the
Parties to the Montreal Protocol, Egyptian Deputy Prime Minister
Youssef Wali reviewed his country's efforts to find alternatives
to ozone-depleting substances.
</P>
<P>
The Montreal Protocol, adopted in September, 1987, is aimed at
controlling the production, trade and use of ozone-depleting
chemicals.
</P>
<P>
Wali, also the minister of agriculture and land reclamation,
said that Egypt has reduced the use of pesticides detrimental to
the environment from an annual 40,000 tonnes to 4,000 tonnes.
</P>
<P>
Egypt has also passed a number of legislations on environment
protection, he said.
</P>
<P>
Representatives from more than 160 countries, international
organizations and non-governmental agencies attended the two-day
meeting.
</P>
<P>
Executive Director of the United Nations Environment Program
Klaus Topfer urged that measures should be taken to stop the
export of equipment and materials that harm the ozone layer from
industrialized countries to developing countries.
</P>
<P>
He underlined the importance of upgrading the awareness of
protecting the ozone layer through scientific and educational
programs.
</P>
<P>
The ozone layer in the stratosphere, between 12-27 kilometers
above the ground, protects all life on earth from the devastating
consequences of ultra-violet radiation.

MOGADISHU, November 23 (Xinhua)-- Heavy fighting took place
between Somali warlord Hussein Aidid's men and that of the
Rahanwein Resistance Army (RRA) Sunday night near the
southwestern town of Baidoa, 240 km southwest of the capital
Mogadishu.
</P>
<P>
Two battle wagons and more than 30 heavily armed infantry
militiamen were sent by Aidid's men to disperse what they
characterized as the RRA terrorists, said reports reaching here
from Baidoa.
</P>
<P>
There is no official word from either Hussein Aidid or the RRA
side over the fighting, however Aidid's militia commanders said
that the clashes at 4 km south of Baidoa Sunday night claimed
lives of three militiamen from Aidid's side while several other
sustained gunshot wounds.

<P>
Two days ago, another clashes between the two sides at Bonkay
Village north of Baidoa, left 6 militiamen dead and over 13
others wounded, said the report.

<P>
The RRA fighters have intensified their insurgence against
Hussein Aidid's bases in Bay and Bakol regions since last October
when the important town of Baidoa fell to the RRA men. The
regions of Bay and Bakol remained under the control of Hussein
Aidid ever since late General Aidid invaded those regions in

<HEADLINE> New Situation Challenges China's Health care </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 23 (Xinhua) -- China's healthcare sector is
currently challenged by inadequate health services, burdens
related to communicable and non-communicable diseases, and a
rapidly ageing population, according to the Chinese Ministry of
Health (MOH).
</P>
<P>
A large gap in accessibility to basic healthcare services still
exists between China's urban and rural areas, according to MOH
Vice-Minister Wang Longde.
</P>
<P>
The medical insurance system which is currently being
established in cities and the cooperative medicare network taking
shape in China's vast rural areas are expected to provide basic
medical services for a large segment of the population.
</P>
<P>
The official noted that communicable and non-communicable
diseases create "double burdens" on the government and the people
as a result of the enormous loss of lives and capital.
</P>
<P>
Tuberculosis, currently the most deadly infectious disease in
China, claims 288,000 lives a year. The TB problem is even
worse amongst rural populations in the most poverty-stricken
counties and migrant workers in areas featuring high-level
economic activity, said Wang.
</P>
<P>
In addition, more than 300,000 Chinese have been infected by
HIV, and the number is expected to climb even further as a result
of VD, intravenous drug injection and infections related to unsafe
blood transfusions.
</P>
<P>
"The country faces a long and arduous task in effectively
preventing and controlling HIV/AIDS," said Wang.
</P>
<P>
Cancers and both cardiovascular and cerebral diseases continue
to rank on the list of the country's major causes of death, with
the nation also witnessing a frightening number of unnecessary
deaths caused by smoking.
</P>
<P>
The latest research results indicate that the tobacco epidemic
may eventually kill as many as 100 million of 300 million Chinese
male smokers under the age of 29, with middle-aged people
accounting for at least half of the total deaths, according to
Wang.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the health care sector has not as yet
adapted to the rapidly ageing population.
</P>
<P>
China will have 230 million people over the age of 60 by the
year 2020, with the world's largest elderly population requiring
increasing medical care, rehabilitation and daily care.
</P>
<P>
MOH not only plans to open a number of health care institutions
for the elderly, but also plans to increase support for geriatric
research.

Organization, attended the meeting at Beijing Medical University

<HEADLINE> Tung: Japanese Economy's Early Recovery Important for Region </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, November 23 (Xinhua) -- An early recovery of the
Japanese economy is vitally important for economic recovery in the
region, Chief Executive Tung Chee Hwa of the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region (SAR), said here Monday.
</P>
<P>
And Hong Kong will continue to be an attractive place to do
business with China and Southeast Asia in the 21st Century, he
said.
</P>
<P>
During his meeting with a delegation of the Keidanren (Japan
Federation of Economic Organizations) led by its Chairman Takashi
Imai, Tung exchanged views with the visitors the latest economic
developments in Hong Kong and Japan.
</P>
<P>
"Despite the short-term economic difficulties we are facing, we
are fortunate to have strong foreign exchange reserves and fiscal
reserves, and we incur no debts," Tung told the visitors. "These
together enable us to put in train a series of expansionary fiscal
measures to stimulate our economy, and to invest in our long-term
competitiveness through development initiatives in education and
infrastructure."
</P>
<P>
"At the same time we are mindful of the need to ensure a level
playing field and preserve the rule of law and freedoms for
everybody," he said.
</P>
<P>
On international financial activities, Tung explained to the
Japanese visitors the need to step up surveillance of
international short-term capital flows, including those of the
hedge funds.
</P>
<P>
"To this end, the recent APEC Economic Leaders Meeting agreed
that deliberations of a new international financial architecture
should be taken up at a forum such as an expanded G22," he said.
"And I am glad that this has the support of Japan."
</P>
<P>
"Participation of Japan in the process will be as important as
that of other emerging market economies like Hong Kong which are
at the receiving end of these short-term capital flows," he said.
</P>
<P>
Tung said that he was pleased with the new measures introduced
by the Japanese government to reflate the economy. "The earlier
the Japanese economy recovers, the sooner the other Asian
economies will rebound," he remarked.
</P>
<P>
Tung Chee Hwa gave his support to the recently announced joint
U.S.-Japan Asian Growth and Recovery Initiative. "We welcome the
Initiative's attempt to address the issues of bank restructuring
and corporate debt restructuring," he said. "It is important that
the Initiative also seeks to catalyze a restart of private sector
capital flow to Asia."
</P>
<P>
Tung said that he hoped to see in the future the traditional
active participation of Japanese financial institutes in the Hong
Kong market.

<HEADLINE> UK Takes Cautious Stance on Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 23 (Xinhua) -- The British government took a
cautious stance on Monday over the latest clash between Iraq and
the U.N. weapons inspection team, noting it was awaiting a clearer
assessment from the U.N. inspectors before deciding its next move.
</P>
<P>
The junior foreign minister, Derek Fatchett, said the
government was watching "very closely" the dispute between Iraq
and the U.N. Special Commission (UNSCOM) over Iraq's objections to
providing documents to the inspectors.
</P>
<P>
"We will have to leave it up to (UNSCOM chief) Richard Butler
and his colleagues to determine the extent to which the work of
the weapons inspectors have been undermined.
</P>
<P>
"But if they feel they have been undermined, then clearly there
is a breach of the agreement that was made just eight days ago
and, in those circumstances, (Iraqi President) Saddam Hussein has
been fully appraised of the consequences that will follow,"
Fatchett told BBC radio in an interview.
</P>
<P>
Last Week, the United Kingdom and the U.S. called off air
strikes against Baghdad after Iraq withdrew its decision not to
cooperate with the inspectors who were seeking to disarm its
chemical, biological and ballistic weapons.
</P>
<P>
But both Washington and London have pledged to strike Iraq
without warning if Baghdad stop again its cooperation with the
U.N. inspectors.

KUALA LUMPUR, November 23 (Xinhua) -- Fatal accidents in
Malaysia from January to October this year dropped by 7.1 percent
as a result of road safety campaigns, Malaysian Transport Minister
Ling Liong Sik said Monday.
</P>
<P>
According to him, fatal accidents went down to 4,400 cases in
the mentioned period this year from 4,738 cases in the same period
last year.
</P>
<P>
Road accident fatalities also dropped by 6.9 percent to 4,869
from 5,232, he said at the opening of the Malaysia International
Motor Show '98 here.
</P>
<P>
Since motorcyclists made up 60 percent of the total number of
fatalities, the reduction of fatality rate showed that road safety
campaigns, especially the multimedia road safety campaigns
targeted at motorcyclists over the past one year, have reached the
target groups, he said.
</P>
<P>
Ling said fatalities from motorcycle accidents dropped from
3,130 cases in the January-October period of 1997 to 2,884 cases
in the same period this year.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia plans to enforce the ruling on the installation of
speed-limit black boxes for tour and express buses on January 1
next year.
</P>
<P>
Ling also urged Malaysia's motor manufacturing industry to come
up with new safety devices with focus on the prevention and
avoidance of road accidents.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: China's Telecom Sector Penetrates Foreign Markets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 23 (Xinhua) -- China and Pakistan recently
inked a contact worth 100 million U.S. dollars calling for the
former to help develop the latter's telecom network.
</P>
<P>
The contract represented the largest technology and products
export agreement signed since 1998.
</P>
<P>
The Shenzhen Zhongxing Telecom Ltd. Co. won the contact and
readily exhibited its ambition to enter the foreign telecom
market.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, Zhongxing signed an agreement with the Congo
establishing a telecom joint venture, the first venture of its
kind China has established in a foreign country, The agreement
also marks the first time a Chinese telecom enterprise will
join in operating a foreign telecom business.
</P>
<P>
The aforementioned facts readily indicate that China's telecom
sector is able to compete with foreign giants in both domestic and
foreign markets, according to officials with the Ministry of
Information Industry.
</P>
<P>
China's telecom equipment market has mainly been occupied by
multinational companies such as Motorola, Siemens, NEC and
American Telephone and Telegraph since the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
Domestic telecom enterprises such as Zhongxing, Huawei, Datang
and Julong nonetheless managed to capture a 50 percent share of
the domestic market in the 1996-1997 period.
</P>
<P>
Chinese enterprises finally outflanked multinationals by
introducing their own products at the domestic program-controled
telephone exchanges market at the end of 1997.
</P>
<P>
"This was a great success for China's telecom enterprises,"
according to Zhongxin's Vice President Zhu Jinwen.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Information Industry recently announced that
China will increase total telephone network switching capacity to
170 million lines. In addition, the number of mobile phone
subscribers will surpass 40 million and the nation's telephone
density will reach 13 percent.
</P>
<P>
Insiders noted that China, one of the world's largest telecom
markets, is a major target of international telecom
competition. Successful experience on the domestic market will
also be helpful in helping China's telecom sector enter foreign
markets.

<HEADLINE> SIMEX HiMSCI Futures Launched </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, November 23 (Xinhua) -- The SIMEX MSCI Hong Kong
Stock Index (HiMSCI) Futures was launched here Monday amid
concerns among related parties in Singapore and Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
The opening bell was rung at 10:00 local time Monday morning at
a launching ceremony.
</P>
<P>
SIMEX is the abbreviation for Singapore International Monetary
Exchange and MSCI stands for Morgan Stanley Capital International.
</P>
<P>
The HiMSCI December 1998 futures contract opened at 7,280 and
traded an intra-day high of 7,416 and low of 7,250 with settlement
of 7,416, according to a press release from the SIMEX.
</P>
<P>
SIMEX Chairman Victor Liew was quoted as saying, "We are
pleased with the trading volume on the first day."
</P>
<P>
The HiMSCI futures is traded from 9.45 a.m. to 12.30 p.m. and
2.30 p.m. to 4.15 p.m.
</P>
<P>
Concerns emerged for potential danger of lax regulatory
standards in relation to SIMEX's Hong Kong stock index futures
contract after SIMEX announced its relaunch of the Hong Kong stock
futures.
</P>
<P>
SIMEX first launched a Hong Kong Stock index futures contract
in March 1993 and delisted it in August 1997 as interest waned.
</P>
<P>
Lax regulatory standards are believed to lead to distortion of
the trading on Stock Exchange of Hong Kong (SEHK) and bring harm
to the flagship index contract Hong Kong futures Exchange.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) reportedly
has written to the Monetary Authority of Singapore to express its
concern about the dangers of Singapore and Hong Kong having
different sets of regulations governing Hang Seng Index futures
trading when a contract for such trading is launched.
</P>
<P>
An informed expert, who did not identify himself, said that
according to MSCI's contract with SIMEX, MSCI is responsible for
providing the Hong Kong index to SIMEX for trading. MSCI was
supposed to compile the Hong Kong index from the data from
Reuters.
</P>
<P>
The Stock Exchange of Hong Kong (SEHK) has reportedly reminded
all its vendors including Reuters on data dissemination of their
contractual obligations which will prohibit them from providing
the data for development of products against the Stock Exchange's
commercial interest.
</P>
<P>
The expert said that the launch of the SIMEX HiMSCI Futures has
two-fold effects on Hong Kong side.
</P>
<P>
At a regulatory level, Hong Kong side has to make sure that the
two markets will not provide scope for regulatory arbitrage where
speculators will profit from the discrepancy between regulatory
requirements in the two markets on the same and/or related
products.
</P>
<P>
At commercial level, the SIMEX HiMSCI poses a direct
competition to Hong Kong Future Exchange's Hang Seng Index futures
and may take some of the HKFE trades to Singapore.
</P>
<P>
HKFE has reportedly been encouraged to respond to the challenge
within the constraints of market integrity and stability.

<HEADLINE> Rummenigge Warns against Decline of German Football </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, November 23 (Xinhua) -- Karl-Heinz Rummenigge, vice
president of league leaders Bayern Munich, warned Monday that the
German football was in danger of slipping behind its
international rivals.
</P>
<P>
"If we don't apply the emergency brakes soon we will have huge
problems in international football," the soccer legend told
Kicker sports magazine.
</P>
<P>
"We have to be careful we don't go into freefall in UEFA's
ratings," added Rummenigge, who as a forward helped the West
Germany team finish runners-up twice at the 1982 and 1986 World
Cup finals.
</P>
<P>
Germany's disappointing performances at this summer's World
Cup in France have been followed by all Bundesliga clubs going
out of this season's UEFA Cup and Cup Winners' Cup tournaments by
the second round.
</P>
<P>
"Fewer German clubs in Europe means, of course, less income.
Our big clubs will then no longer be in a position to keep up
either financially or at a sporting level," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Although the Bundesliga was able to attract many foreign
players, they were nowhere near the quality and attractiveness of
the stars who are playing in Spain, Italy and England."
</P>
<P>
Like the Bayern president Franz Beckenbauer, Rummenigge called
for an independent German league, run by the clubs themselves but
under the umbrella of the German Football Federation (DFB).

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 23 (Xinhua) -- The All-China Federation of
Trade Unions today held a forum in the Great Hall of the People to
mark the 100th birth anniversary of late Chinese President Liu
Shaoqi.
</P>
<P>
Wei Jianxing, president of the federation and a member of the
Political Bureau Standing Committee under the Central Committee of
the Chinese Communist Party (CPC), pointed to Liu's great
contributions to the Chinese revolution and national construction,
especially to the development of the Chinese Workers Movement.
</P>
<P>
Wei noted that Liu was one of the major leaders and
organizers of the movement which was a major part of his life.
</P>
<P>
He cited Liu an outstanding leader and theoretician, and noted
that the late Chinese leader consistently stressed the role of
trade unions in the movement, enlightening the awareness of
workers and protecting their interests.
</P>
<P>
He said Liu's theories are highly significant in China even
today.
</P>
<P>
Liu emphasized whole-heartedly relying on the working class
following the founding of New China in 1949, as well as throughout
the period in which the country was shifting its focus to economic
construction.
</P>
<P>
Wei called on the trade unions at various levels to uphold Liu
Shaoqi's revolutionary spirit and lofty characteristics in order to
promote the Chinese Workers Movement under the leadership of the
CPC. He also called for the creation of a new situation enabling
them to play a greater role in the nation's trade unions.
</P>
<P>
He urged the federation to safeguard the rights and interests
of all the people and the interests of employees, while continuing
fine traditions of trade unions and serving workers.

<HEADLINE> Jiang, Yeltsin Call for Respect for Diversified Cultures </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, November 23 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Chinese President
Jiang Zemin and his Russian counterpart Boris Yeltsin on Monday
urged all countries to acknowledge and respect diversified world
cultures and pledged to work together towards this goal.
</P>
<P>
The two presidents said in a joint statement issued following
their informal meeting that to acknowledge and respect the
diversity of world cultures is the indispensable condition and
objective requirement for establishing a new world economic and
political order.
</P>
<P>
The present-day world is rich and colorful, where many
different cultures co-exist and complement each other,
representing one of the main forces driving the mankind forward
constantly, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The differences in history, culture, economy and social and
political systems should not be the root of or excuse for
conflicts and alienation among countries, the two presidents said.
</P>
<P>
Instead, they should be the driving force for countries to
benefit each other and perfect themselves, they said.
</P>
<P>
The next century can not and should not be an "
European-and-American" century or an "Asia-Pacific" century.
Neither should it be dominated by a certain religion or
ideological system, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The new century should and can be an era when different
cultures and traditions of all countries will be able to exist in
harmony and flourish together, it said.
</P>
<P>
China and Russia will adhere to the above-stated position in
handling their bilateral relations and relations with other
countries, the two presidents said.
</P>
<P>
The statement said that a constructive multipolarization
process of world relations will help build a balanced, stable,
democratic and non-confrontational new order, and the trend meets
the fundamental interest of all countries.

<P>
Haessler, a 32-year-old who has played 97 times for Germany,

<HEADLINE> Cambodia's CPP, FUNCINPEC Sign Coalition Agreements </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, November 23 (Xinhua) -- Cambodia's two major
political parties, the ruling Cambodian People's Party (CPP) and
FUNCINPEC, signed two important documents on the formation of a
new government Monday afternoon at the Council of Ministers here.
</P>
<P>
The two documents were the political platform and power-sharing
in the new government. CPP President Chea Sim and Vice President
Hun Sen and FUNCINPEC party President Prince Ranariddh and General
Secretary Toh Lah signed the documents.
</P>
<P>
Hun Sen announced after the signing that the new government
will be formed on November 30. That is ahead of the ASEAN
(Association of Southeast Asian Nations) summit meeting scheduled
for mid-December in Hanoi, Vietnam, keeping alive a slim hope that
Cambodia might be admitted into the regional group.
</P>
<P>
On power-sharing, the two parties agreed to have two vice prime
ministers with one from each party. Among the government's 25
ministries, the CPP will be in charge of 12 ministries including
those of foreign affairs, finance and commerce, while the
FUNCINPEC will chair 11 ministries, such as justice and
information.
</P>
<P>
But the two key ministries of national defense and interior
will have co-ministers.
</P>
<P>
The platform will be presented after the National Assembly
approves the CPP's Hun Sen as sole prime minister. The National
Assembly is scheduled to meet Wednesday to elect Ranariddh its
president.
</P>
<P>
A preliminary deal struck last week calls for the prince as
National Assembly president and Hun Sen as prime minister.
</P>
<P>
The new government will be the second CPP-FUNCINPEC coalition.
The first one collapsed after the July 1997 factional fighting
which toppled first prime minister Ranariddh.
</P>
<P>
The formation of the new government came to a deadlock after
the FUNCINPEC and Sam Rainsy Party rejected the results of the
election, claiming that the CPP won the elections through fraud
and intimidation.
</P>
<P>
King Norodom Sihanouk played a key role in mediating the three
factions to a comprise in the interest of the nation and the
people.

<HEADLINE> Zambia to Declare War on Criminals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, November 23 (Xinhua) -- Zambian Home Affairs Minister,
Katele Kalumba, has declared war on criminals in the country and
said that he will not rest until they are eliminated.
</P>
<P>
Kalumba said at the weekend the time had come for the
authorities to take the criminals on "punch-for-punch".
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks against a backdrop of an upsurge in crime
in Lusaka involving gun battles between police and criminals.
</P>
<P>
He said police are working very hard in trying to contain the
situation and a hard stance is needed if the scourge is to be
eliminated.
</P>
<P>
"We are at war with crime right now. Iter.
</P>
<P>
He noted that there is a commitment from his office to see to
it that crime is reduced in the country and several measures to
this end are put in place.
</P>
<P>
Kalumba warned that Zambia is at serious risk of being
over-run by criminals.
</P>
<P>
He urged the Zambians to help police officers carry out their
duties since the police have limited resources with which they
have to carry out their tasks.
</P>
<P>
Kalumba also disclosed the bulk of the crime is being carried
out by aliens, adding that this is all the more reason why the
Zambians should join together to fight the scourge.
</P>
<P>
In tresidence in Lusaka early this month.
</P>
<P>
In a bid to curb the crime wave in Lusaka, the Zambian
government offered on Saturday a seven-day general amnesty for
those with illegal firearms to surrender them to the police.

<HEADLINE> Iraq's Kurdish Party Not to Support PKK: Party </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, November 23 (Xinhua) -- Leader of the Iraqi Patriotic
Union of Kurdistan (PUK) Jalal Talabani has said that his party
will not allow members of the outlawed Kurdish Workers' Party
(PKK) to take shelter in northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Turkey's Anatolia News Agency Monday quoted Talabani as
saying that under an agreement signed by the PUK and the Iraqi
Kurdish Democratic Party (KDP) in Washington in September, the
Turkish security forces are allowed to launch military operations
against PKK militants in northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Most of the PKK rebels have been staying in northern Iraq
since the 1991 Gulf War and launching cross-border attacks at
Turkish targets.
</P>
<P>
Turkish government troops killed 19 PKK militants in Yuksekova
town of Hakkari province linking neighboring Iran, three in Batman
province and one in Bingol province, said a statement issued by
the Office of Emergency Regional Rule Monday.
</P>
<P>
However, it did not mention when the PKK rebels were killed.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Turkish Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz has strongly
condemned Italy for granting political asylum for PKK head
Abdullah Ocalan, who was detained by Italian police in Rome on
November 12.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has been asking Italy for the extradition of Ocalan,
but Italy rejected a Turkish warrant for the arrest of the
PKK leader under the Italian law barring extradition to
countries where suspects face death penalty.
</P>
<P>
Ocalan left the hospital outside Rome on Saturday where he had
been in custody since his arrest for a private residence in the
capital.
</P>
<P>
The PKK, led by Ocalan, has been fighting a 14-year-old
separatist war for autonomy in southeastern Turkey, which has
claimed at least 37,000 lives since August 1984.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian President: Govt Not to Stay After Election </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, November 23 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian President B.J.
Habibie said here Monday that his government does not intend to
stay in power after the general election slated to be held in late
May or early June next year.
</P>
<P>
The president said that if circumstances and the Constitution
permit it, the general session of the People's Consultative
Assembly (MPR) in 1999 could be convened one week or one month
after the general election.
</P>
<P>
"Don't entertain the notion that Habibie will maintain (his)
cabinet (after the election). This is not right," the official
Antara News Agency quoted the president as saying.
</P>
<P>
However, he pointed out that the holding of the general session
of the MPR, during which a new president and vice president will
be elected, must be conducted pursuant to the Constitution and in
conformity with the voice of the people as reflected through their
representatives in the new parliament.
</P>
<P>
Some time ago, Habibie said the government and House Speaker
Harmoko had agreed that the general session of the MPR would be
convened in December 1999 because in the past some six months had
been required to prepare for a well-organized session.
</P>
<P>
But some opposition parties urged the government to hold the
general session of the MPR within two and three months.
</P>
<P>
The government, Habibie said, is also committed to organizing a
democratic, quality, honest and fair general election, which will
involve a number of international organizations such as the United
Nations Development Program and a number of advanced countries
like the United States, Germany, Britain, France and Japan.

<HEADLINE> Li Peng Meets ABB President and CEO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 23 (Xinhua) -- Li Peng, chairman of the
Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, today
met with Goran Lindahl, president and chief executive officer of
the ABB Group.
</P>
<P>
ABB won a bid to manufacture hydraulic generators for China's
Three Gorges Power Project, and it recently announced
its plans to expand investments and transfer more technology to
China.
</P>
<P>
Li expressed appreciation of ABB's efforts to undertake the
contract and expand cooperation with China. He also expressed his
hope that more achievements be made in the future.
</P>
<P>
The NPC chairman stressed that China's primary energy resources
such as coal and oil are mainly located in the western part of the
country, while the eastern region suffers from power
shortages. "Transmitting power from the west to the east is
inevitable," said Li, adding that years of experience show that
power transmission is more economical than transporting coal.
</P>
<P>
He said though power supply can meet demand in some regions of
China, the per capita power generatiing capacity is only
0.2 kilowatts. "The power industry must be further developed," said
Li.
</P>
<P>
The power engineer-turned official said the weak power
distribution network has become a major barrier hingering the
growth of the power market. The renovation of the power grids
should be strengthened, said Li.
</P>
<P>
Lindahl said that his company is fully prepared for
strengthening cooperation with China and expressed the hope for
more involvements in the Three Gorges Project.

<HEADLINE> WHO Director Lauds China's Health Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 23 (Xinhua) -- A top world health
organization official today expressed appreciation for China's
efforts to improve the health of the world's largest population
over the past half century.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at Beijing Medical University, Dr. Gro Brundtland,
director-general of the World Health Organization, described
China's progress in achieving better health as "extraordinarily
rapid and comprehensive."
</P>
<P>
It is absolutely astounding that the life expectancy in China
has doubled and the infant mortality has dropped from 200 per
1,000 to 35 per 1,000 live births since the founding of the
People's Republic of China in 1949, according to Brundtland.
</P>
<P>
The country is also close to eradicating polio well in advance
of the ambitious target for global elimination at the end of the
year 2,000.
</P>
<P>
She added that the success can be attributed to the broad
social participation and the public observation of the National
Immunization Days every December.
</P>
<P>
The WHO director-general congratulated China on the vast
experience the country has gained in fighting and controlling
malaria.
</P>
<P>
She pointed out that China not only participated in initiation
of the Roll Back Malaria Project, but has also used traditional
medicines to develop an effective anti-malaria compound, and
joined in the project to reduce the global malaria burden through
interventions adapted to local needs.
</P>
<P>
Brundtland reviewed cooperation between WHO and China in
controlling tuberculosis, and noted that the Directly Observed
Treatment Short-Course (DOTS) strategy implemented in the
country in 1992 has covered about half the population and helped
to cure over one million TB patients.
</P>
<P>
"China has been the world's most successful country in
implementing the DOTS strategy," said Brundtland, who is visiting
China at the invitation of the Ministry of Health. Brundtland is
on her first official visit to a WHO member nation since she
assumed office.
</P>
<P>
"Our coming to China was far from a coincidence," said the WHO
official, adding that "the great country represents a crossroads
for today's global health agenda."
</P>
<P>
However, she pointed out that China also faces a number of
challenges which are also confronting many other countries and
indeed WHO itself.
</P>
<P>
"The World Health Organization looks forwards to its
partnership with China,' said Brundtland. Endithem

<P>
HONG KONG, November 23 (Xinhua) -- Asia Satellite
Telecommunications Company Limited (AsiaSat) announced here Monday
that it has signed an Authorization To Proceed (ATP) with Hughes
Space and Communications International Inc. (Hughes) to build a
backup communications satellite for an identical one the company
plans to launch next year.
</P>
<P>
The satellite, a Hughes HS601HP spacecraft, is identical to
AsiaSat 3S, which is scheduled for launch in the first quarter of
1999. If the backup satellite is not required for the role, it
can be modified to serve as a future AsiaSat satellite. This
spacecraft can be completed at a date which allows a launch before
the retirement of AsiaSat 1 in late 1999.
</P>
<P>
"We are pleased that we have obtained approvals from our Board
of Directors and our financiers to procure a backup satellite.
This ensures that our customers on AsiaSat 1 can continue their
services at the current orbital position of 105.5 degrees East
without threat of interruption. It also assists us with our plans
to move forward with AsiaSat 4," said Peter Jackson, chief
executive officer of AsiaSat.
</P>
<P>
A leading regional satellite operator in Asia, AsiaSat serves
over two-thirds of the world's population with its three
satellites -- AsiaSat 1, AsiaSat 2 and AsiaSat G. AsiaSat 3S will
replace AsiaSat 1 upon launch, according to the company.

<HEADLINE> Manila Not to Oppose Telephone Company Deal With </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, November 23 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government said
Monday that it will not oppose any deal between the Philippine
Long Distance Telephone Co. (PLDT) with a foreign partner as long
as it complies with the law.
</P>
<P>
At his regular press briefing here, presidential spokesman
Jerry Barican said that the Department of Transportation and
Communications (DOTC) has not issued any statements opposing the
buy-in plan of the Hong Kong-based First Pacific Co. into the
PLDT.
</P>
<P>
Earlier reports quoted DOTC Undersecretary Josefina Lichauco
and DOTC Secretary Vicente Rivera as raising a warning that the
merger between the two companies could lead to monopoly,
considering that First Pacific is the mother company of Smart
Communications.
</P>
<P>
"The position of Secretary Rivera and the DOTC and the
government is that this is a private matter between the parties,
and the government will not oppose it," Barican said.
</P>
<P>
"The only concern of the government is that the laws be obeyed,
meaning, the constitutional requirements on equity and any other
applicable laws will be applied by the government regulatory
agencies that are supposed to review this deal, once it is finally
approved or consummated," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Constitution limits foreign ownership of a public utility
company in the Philippines to just 40 percent.

<HEADLINE> HKSAR Formulates Program to Enhance Fire Safety </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, November 23 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region (SAR) government has formulated an
improvement program to enhance fire safety, Secretary for Security
Regina Ip said here on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The program included strengthening the legislative and
administrative framework to upgrade fire safety facilities in the
old buildings, stepping up inspections and enforcement actions,
and promoting a fire safety culture among the building management
profession in particular and the community in general, Ip said.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the opening ceremony of the three-day Fire Asia' 98
Conference and Exhibition, Ip said Hong Kong, like many other
metropolitan cities, faced the problem of having many old
buildings equipped with outdated or ill-maintained fire service
installations.
</P>
<P>
The Hong Kong Fire Services Department (FSD) would step up
enforcement action to require buildings to reinstate defective or
missing fire service installations to approved standards, and to
abate fire hazards, Ip said.
</P>
<P>
The Department aims to conduct 7,000 inspections of private
buildings next year to ensure that the fire safety requirements
are complied with. "It will also review the Fire Services
Ordinance to strengthen its enforcement against fire hazards," she
added.
</P>
<P>
Ip stressed the importance for the community to contribute to
the fire safety improvement by maintaining their fire safety
installations and reporting identified fire hazards. "We will
raise the fire safety awareness of the community through enhanced
publicity and promotion of community involvement in the fight
against fire," she said.
</P>
<P>
The FSD will conduct fire drills for building owners and
occupants and organize seminars, exhibitions and talks on fire
safety.
</P>
<P>
And among other initiatives are the introduction of a Fire
Safety Ambassador Scheme to raise the fire safety awareness among
the younger generation and efforts to help building owners to help
themselves.
</P>
<P>
A Building Management Resource Center was established in June
this year to provide information, services and advice for building
owners, residents, Owners Corporations, Mutual Aid Committees and
management bodies to assist in improving the standards of
management, safety and maintenance of their buildings.
</P>
<P>
The President of the Hong Kong Branch of the Institution of
Fire Engineers (IFE), John Tsang Kwong-Yu, said that the fourth
international fire engineering conference ever held in Hong Kong
includes 30 sessions of talks, workshops and case studies
involving various approaches made in eastern and western
countries in enhancing the fire safety of old buildings and
attempts to develop an integrated approach to raise their fire
safety standards.
</P>
<P>
The Fire Asia' 98 is jointly organized by the Hong Kong Branch
of the IFE and the United Kingdom-based Loss Prevention Council,
and is supported by the Hong Kong FSD.
</P>
<P>
Speakers at the meeting included Director of the Fire
Department Sun Lun and Deputy Chief of the Scientific Division Gao
Wei, both from China's Public Security Ministry.
</P>
<P>
They are joined by representatives from other countries and
regions including Belgium, Canada, Japan, Malaysia, the United
Kingdom and United States. More than 200 delegates including about
40 fire chiefs attended the meeting.

who advised on the GDR, he said.
</P>
<P>
One major beneficiary of the GDR program, so far, is the
United Bank for Africa (UBA) in which a Saudi price and other
institutional investors recently picked a major stake worth more
than 2 billion Naira (about 23 million U.S. Dollars), he added.
</P>
<P>
Alile pointed out that the issue of Nigerian companies to be
listed on NYSE was discussed in New York when Nigerian Head of
State General Abdulsalami Abubakar visited the stock exchange.
</P>
<P>
The head of state instructed Nigerian minister of finance to
work on it, said Alile who was in the entourage of the head of
state, adding that "we are looking at it, and we are working on
getting one of our companies fully listed on the New York Stock
Exchange."
</P>
<P>
According to Alile, GDR provides an outlet for big industrial
quoted companies in the West African country to raise huge
capital for expansion and modernization.
</P>
<P>
He noted that "Our market is rated high in terms of return on
investment", adding that by the current rating of the
International Finance Corporation, "The NSE was rated among the
best in terms of return on investment. This will attract
investors."

<HEADLINE> Two Kenyan Banks Seek Merger Approval </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, November 23 (Xinhua) -- Two small Kenyan banks,
Commerce Bank and Giro Bank, have sought the Central Bank of
Kenya (CBK)'s approval for a merger following the collapse of
five private commercial banks in the past two months.
</P>
<P>
The merger will result in a bank with a 400-million-Shilling
(6.6 million U.S. Dollars) capitalization base.
</P>
<P>
Senior managers at the two banks said the application was made
three weeks ago, but the CBK chief banking manager, Reuben
Marambii, declined to give details on the issue, saying only that
the bank was perusing the application, the East African Weekly
reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
Managers at the two banks said the banks share a chairman,
Chandu Gidumal, as well as a number of directors.
</P>
<P>
Commerce Bank started off as a hire purchase bank 15 years ago
while Giro has operated as a bank since its inception in 1993.
</P>
<P>
Giro Bank is expected to raise 134 million Shillings (2.2
million Dollars) while the rest will come from Commerce Bank.
Both banks have two branches each.
</P>
<P>
"The different backgrounds of the two banks are expected to
result in a compatible synergy," said a source close to the
banks.
</P>
<P>
Gidumal declined to respond to enquiries on the merger, but a
source said the two banks did not wish to comment on the merger
for fear of jeopardizing their application.
</P>
<P>
"We will announce details when Central Bank approves. The
process is at an advanced stage and we expect a response any time
now," said a senior Giro bank manager.
</P>
<P>
The deceptive calm in the small banks sector was broken two
weeks ago with the closure of City Finance and Prudential banks
by CBK due to a persistent run by depositors.
</P>
<P>
In late September, the central bank also shut down Trust Bank,
the country's seventh largest bank as well as Reliance and
Bullion banks.
</P>
<P>
There are 55 banks in Kenya, 33 of which are classified as
small.
</P>
<P>
The CBK has said that 14 non-bank financial institutions and
26 of 55 commercial banks risk closure at the end of next year,
when a new banking rule requiring them to increase their capital
base becomes effective.
</P>
<P>
Small banks must raise nearly 3.9 billion Shillings (65
million Dollars) in the next 18 months, according to the
regulations.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, mergers are likely to face the very hurdles that
have caused the initial problem: many of the small banks have
strong links with particular racial or ethnic groups, or the
political establishment.

<HEADLINE> WHO Reaffirms Tough Policy Stance Against Tobacco </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 23 (Xinhua) -- Top officials from the World
Health Organization (WHO) today reaffirmed tough policies against
tobacco as concerns rise that related use may pose even a greater
health threat to human beings in the future.
</P>
<P>
"Tobacco is a killer. Tobacco should not be advertised,
subsidized or glamourized," according to Dr. Gro Brundtland,
director-general of WHO.
</P>
<P>
Brundtland made the remarks in speech presented at Beijing
Medical University.
</P>
<P>
The WHO leader, who is in Beijing on an official visit, said
she believes in both the science and the evidence.
</P>
<P>
The tobacco epidemic will kill an estimated 3.5 million people
throughout the world this year alone. The annual death toll is
expected to rise to 10 million in the next century, with some 70
percent of deaths occurring in developing countries, warned
Bruntland.
</P>
<P>
WHO plans to launch the Tobacco Free Initiative (TFI) to
increase global awareness about the dangers of tobacco and
decrease consumption, according to the medical expert who has
devoted herself to anti-smoking campaigns since she assumed the
office of WHO director-general last July.
</P>
<P>
She also announced that the organization is working on an
international framework convention on tobacco control for the
first time in the history of the largest United Nations
organization.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Dereck Yach, project manager for TFI, told participants in
a symposium on tobacco and health in China that TFI project will
be carried out in six demonstration countries, including China,
beginning next year.
</P>
<P>
"China's health departments fully support the project and
promise to engage in concerted efforts," said Peng Yu, Chinese
vice minister of Health.
</P>
<P>
The project staff will collect evidence supporting effective
tobacco control action, and reveal the dangers tobacco presents to
youngsters, especially in developing countries.
</P>
<P>
WHO has amply reasons for strengthening tobacco control efforts,
according to Yach. For example, half a billion smokers around the
world will die from the habit and tobacco harms the environment.
</P>
<P>
The official expressed hope that efforts will achieve certain
goals such as convincing governments to raise prices for all
tobacco products and use a portion of revenues for tobacco control.
</P>
<P>
Tobacco advertising and promotion should be banned, effective
health warnings should be placed on all tobacco products, sales to
children must be prohibited, and cessation programs must
be provided by all health facilities, according to Yach.

<HEADLINE> Pak Minister On Enhanced Communication Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, November 23 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani Communication
Minister Raja Nadir Pervaiz Monday stressed the need for enhanced
communication cooperation among developing countries.
</P>
<P>
He made the call while inaugurating a two-day ministerial
conference to conclude the implementation rules of a quadrilateral
agreement signed in March 1995 by Pakistan, China, Kirghizstan and
Kazakhstan.
</P>
<P>
Nadir said the implementation of the agreement can serve as an
important building block for a truly cooperative and
interdependent economic relationship.
</P>
<P>
By providing a transport system of goods for the promotion of
trade within the four countries as well as with the rest of the
world, Nadir said that the agreement will add much needed dynamism
to the economies of the region.
</P>
<P>
"At the threshold of a new millennium, most developing
countries are faced with the challenge of meeting the rising
expectations for a better quality of life by our people," he said.
</P>
<P>
Countries all over the world have joined hands to meet this
challenge and it is only appropriate that Pakistan, China,
Kirghizstan and Kazakhstan also cooperate in this regard, said the
minister.
</P>
<P>
The minister said that under this agreement, energy and other
products originating in Kazakhstan and Kirghizstan will reach not
only Pakistan and China, but any port elsewhere of the world
through the port of Karachi in southern Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
Similarly, he said, Chinese industrial goods can easily find
markets in the other three partner countries.
</P>
<P>
He hoped that the conference may consider a mechanism for
continued exchange of information among the four countries on new
technologies for building infrastructure, on innovative and new
mechanisms for financing them and on ways to operate and manage
the road systems.
</P>
<P>
The conference was being attended by communication ministers
from Pakistan, China, Kirghizstan and Kazakhstan.

<HEADLINE> Australian Dollar Ends Weaker in Quiet Trading </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, November 23 (Xinhua) -- The Australian dollar closed
lower Monday, drawn down by weaker commodity prices and a stronger
U.S. dollar in a day of sleepy trading.
</P>
<P>
Stuart Moore, manager of foreign exchange trading for
Australia's St. George Bank, said the local currency spent most of
the day stuck in a tight range.
</P>
<P>
It closed in Sydney at 64.02 U.S. cents from 64.36 U.S. cents
last Friday after trading between 63.97 U.S. cents and 64.15 U.S.
cents during the session.
</P>
<P>
Moore said apart from the weaker opening the Australian dollar
had done very little all day, with a public holiday in Japan
helping keep things quiet.
</P>
<P>
He said the market was showing reluctance at the moment, with
many still expecting a rate cut out of next Tuesday's board
meeting of the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA).
</P>
<P>
Last week, several countries' central banks, including the U.S.
Federal Reserve, lowered interest rates but the RBA had so far
made no response.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar was buying 76.97 Japanese yen from 76.91
yen last Friday and 1.0828 German marks from 1.0846 marks.

<HEADLINE> HK Government Determined to Uphold Rule of Law: Tung </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, November 23 (Xinhua) -- Chief Executive Tung Chee
Hwa of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) Monday
pledged to uphold the rule of law, ensure freedom of press and
encourage the opening up of the information market.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the 31st Annual Conference of the Chinese Language
Press Institute here, Tung said Hong Kong is an international
financial center and an information center as well.
</P>
<P>
These two identities are interrelated: A well-developed
information system is an essential element in development, which
attracts financial investments to Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
To further strengthen its position as an information center,
Hong Kong needs all kinds of advanced communications facilities,
he said.
</P>
<P>
Tung stressed that to ensure a high degree of freedom of press
and consolidate Hong Kong's position as a financial center as
well as an information center, the SAR government gives weight to
two key points.
</P>
<P>
-- The government's commitment to adherence to the rule of law
as well as a legal system that creates an environment to ensure
and protect freedom of press and freedom of information;
</P>
<P>
-- The quality of information must be maintained at the highest
level. In addition to speedy dissemination of information, it is
imperative to attach importance to the accuracy of information
being transmitted.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Tung emphasized that the press and other forms of
media should take up their social responsibility, saying they
should not ignore the impact they would make on the community for
the sake of good circulation and profit making.
</P>
<P>
The principle of truthfulness and impartiality should be upheld
in news reporting and the practice of the media should be
monitored by the public, he added.
</P>
<P>
More than 70 representatives from Singapore, Malaysia, Japan,
Thailand, Britain as well as the Chinese mainland, Hong Kong and
Taiwan participated in the annual meeting, the first of its kind
since Hong Kong returned to China on July 1 last year.
</P>
<P>
According to official statistics, a total of 742 local
newspapers and other publications have been published in Hong
Kong. The volume of newspaper reading per capita in Hong Kong is
regarded as one of the highest in the world.
</P>
<P>
The number of newspapers published in the Chinese mainland has
increased from some 180 to more than 2,000 following its reforms
in the last two decades.

MOSCOW, November 23 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Chinese President
Jiang Zemin and his Russian counterpart Boris Yeltsin issued a
joint declaration on the China-Russia Relations on the Turn of the
Century here Monday.
</P>
<P>
The two heads of state held an informal meeting in Moscow's

their stands on the basic trend of the world social development at
the turn of the century and reached consensus on the prospects of

coordinated development should become an important principle to be
followed by the mankind in the coming century.
</P>
<P>
They pointed out that building China-Russia strategic
partnership is not forming an alliance and not directed at any
third party, but is aimed at abandoning confrontation between the
two countries so as to create favorable conditions for the
broadest cooperation on the basis of equality and mutual benefit.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Awaits China in Asiad Badminton Showdown </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, November 23 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia expects a final
showdowns against its perennial opponent China in the Asian Games
badminton competition next month.
</P>
<P>
With a total of seven gold medals at stake, the two
arch-rivals will open their fierce contest for the laurels in the
men's and women's team events, the head of the Badminton
Association of Indonesia's (PBSI) training center Christian
Hadinata predicted.
</P>
<P>
"Indonesia and China will reach the women's team final
unchallenged. But in the men's category Indonesia will have to
overcome dark horses like Malaysia and South Korea before playing
China in the final," Christian was quoted by the Jakarta Post on
Monday as saying.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia has set a target of winning at least two gold medals
in December's Asiad in Bangkok, Thailand.
</P>
<P>
Christian admitted China stood a better chance than Indonesia
in the women's team event, thanks to its star-studded lineup. The
two teams last met in the Uber Cup final which was won by China.
</P>
<P>
But Christian, who is a former doubles specialist, said Mia
Audina and her teammates would stretch the Chinese to limit.
</P>
<P>
"Mia could upset world number one Ye Zhaoying in the first
singles match, while the new partnership of Elysa and Deyana
Lomban stand a chance of overcoming the world number one pair of
Ge Fei and Gu Jun," Christian said.
</P>
<P>
Atlanta Olympics silver medalist Mia said she has put past
troubles behind her and is ready for what is only her second
appearance at the Asian Games.
</P>
<P>
The young team fielded by Indonesia in the men's event face a
tougher route to the final.
</P>
<P>
Christian said world number five singles player Hendrawan and
Olympic men's doubles champions Ricky Subagja and Rexy Mainaky,
the oldest players in the eight-man team, would be the best bets
at the Asiad.
</P>
<P>
Hendrawan said he would not squander the rare opportunity to
win a medal at the Asiad.
</P>
<P>
"Experience has taught me that the first singles match is
crucial in a team event. But I won't be burdened by that
knowledge. I will just enjoy the game and beat my opponents," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Hendrawan regarded China's world number two Sun Jun and world
number three Yong Hock Kin of Malaysia as his toughest rivals.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia is to field Hendrawan, world number 18 Taufik
Hidayat and world number 24 Budi Santoso, a last minute
replacement for world number 14 Marlev Mainaky who was forced to
pull out with a knee injury.
</P>
<P>
Both Ricky and Rexy, who top the world rankings, are
optimistic about their chances of winning a second straight gold
medal.
</P>
<P>
"I don't think we need special preparations for the Asiad.
Ricky and I are bound to become a united force. We only need to
concentrate in each match," said 30-year-old Rexy, a father of
two children.
</P>
<P>
Ricky added: "We want a victory to silence those who are
doubtful about the solidity of our partnership. Although Rexy is
married and has children, his performances are still good. I
believe we can enjoy every match and Insya Allah (God willing) we
can win."

<HEADLINE> U.S., Australian Firms in 1 Billion U.S. Dollar Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, November 23 (Xinhua) -- U.S.-based energy
conglomerate American Electrical Power (AEP) Monday purchased a
power distribution company in Australia's leading industrial and
business center at the price of 1.08 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. company won the auction for Citipower, an electricity
distributor in the state of Victoria, one of the two major
industrial and business centers in Australia.
</P>
<P>
The successful bid, which had been higher than anticipated,
could herald further investment in Australia by the U.S. company
and bodes well for the upcoming sale of Victoria's three gas
retail and distribution businesses.
</P>
<P>
As one of the largest energy groups in the United States, AEP
owns 37 coal and hydro plants and one nuclear plant and supplies
customers with power in states across the Midwest and south.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. company already owns 20 percent of Victoria's
hydro-electric company Pacific Hydro.
</P>
<P>
The 1.7 billion Australian dollar (1.08 U.S. dollar) purchase
price meant a profit for Citipower owner Entergy Corp., which
bought Citipower from the Victoria government in January 1996 for
1.58 billion Australian dollars (1 billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The losing bidders from the shortlist were believed to be a
consortium of Singapore Power and Boral Ltd. and the Texas
Utilities group, which included HongkongBank and Commonwealth Bank
of Australia Ltd.
</P>
<P>
The purchase of Citipower was expected to be finalized by the
end of 1998.
</P>
<P>
Victoria Premier Jeff Kennett said the sale price was about 100
million Australian dollars (64 million U.S. dollars) more than the
state government sold it about three years ago.

fuel and upgrade citizens' awareness of environmental protection.
</P>
<P>
The plan, estimated to cost 60 million U.S. dollars, will be
financed by the United States, the Arabic-language daily said.

<P>
But it did not say what results are expected of Cairo's air
conditions after the plan has been implemented.
</P>
<P>
The semi-official newspaper said that on an average, 9,000
people in Cairo die of and 14,000 others suffer from diseases
caused by air pollution every year.
</P>
<P>
More than 2 million cars are running on the streets of Cairo
and 200 casting factories are operational in the city, which the
newspaper said are mainly blamed for the air pollution.

<HEADLINE> 3 Southeast Asian Nations Propose Muslims' Food Hub </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, November 23 (Xinhua) -- The
Indonesia-Malaysia-Thailand Growth Triangle (IMT-GT) will be the
region's "halal" (allowed by Muslim law) food hub to cater for the
needs of Muslims in the region and elsewhere, Malaysia IMT-GT
Chairman Daim Zainuddin said Monday.
</P>
<P>
He said the matter was being pursued by the 18-member IMT-GT
Business Council.
</P>
<P>
The proposal, agreed upon by the three governments, is expected
to be implemented next year for the benefit of some 2,000 million
Muslims worldwide, with the involvement of foreign investors
either individually or on a joint-venture basis.
</P>
<P>
The "halal" food processing industry has vast growth potentials
in the IMT-GT because of the presence of a large Muslim population
as well as an easy access to manpower and raw materials, he said
after a special briefing on the National Economic Recovery Plan in
the northern state of Pulau Pinang, the Malaysian national news
agency Bernama said.
</P>
<P>
Daim, who is also Malaysia's special function minister, said
the government would provide facilities and support for the
"halal" food hub but the private sector would play an active part.
</P>
<P>
The center could also produce non-food items which meet the
requirement of Muslims, Daim said.

<HEADLINE> Colombo's Bus Strike Widens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, November 23 (Xinhua)-- Thousands of commuters were
seen scrambling to get into the few available buses Monday morning
due to a lightning strike on certain routes here.
</P>
<P>
The strike, which started with the pulling out of private buses
on route No. 192 last Saturday, has now been joined by those
operating on routes 100, 120 and 138 in support of those who
initiated the bus strike.
</P>
<P>
It is alleged that the driver and conductor of a private bus on
route No. 192 were assaulted by an official from the Western
Provincial Council Transport Authority last Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The private operators were outraged as no action was taken on
this matter. Transport and Highways Minister A.H.M Fowzie said he
has asked police to investigate and arrest the suspect, according
to informed sources here.
</P>
<P>
Attempts to bring about a solution has up to now failed and
there is anxiety among the authorities whether the strike is going
to spread further.
</P>
<P>
Shortage of buses on roads Monday resulted in unusual crowds at
 railway stations. School children and women travelers are likely
to suffer the most by the present bus strike, the sources said.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Uses BPAs to Develop Viable Export Markets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, November 23 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia has signed
Bilateral Payments Arrangement (BPA) agreements with 26 countries,
which have opened up non-traditional markets for Malaysian
products.
</P>
<P>
The BPAs could be further developed for the country to get into
viable export markets in the medium and long term, Public Bank
said in its July-August 1998 Economic Review released here Monday.
</P>
<P>
Since 1988 when Malaysia signed its first BPA, Malaysia's total
trade with the 26 countries has increased to 16.37 billion ringgit
(4.31 billion U.S. dollars) in the first nine months of 1998 from
3.63 billion ringgit (955.26 million dollars) in the same period
of 1990, it said.
</P>
<P>
"Although Malaysia's trade with these economies is relatively
low, there is room for further improvement in the near future,"
the bank said.
</P>
<P>
The bank said Malaysia's trade under the BPAs, which in 1997
was about 40 million ringgit (about 10.53 million dollars), is
likely to increase further in the near future if more ASEAN
(Association of Southeast Asian Nations) countries are to adopt
them.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN finance ministers have agreed to develop a BPA mechanism
to promote intra-ASEAN trade and to conserve foreign reserves by
allowing trade settlement in local currencies.
</P>
<P>
Under the BPA, an alternative mechanism to promote trade,
Malaysian exporters will be more confident to conduct trade with
the non-traditional markets given that the payment arrangement
involves the central banks of both parties, it said.
</P>
<P>
The guarantee payments provided by the central banks under BPA
reduce the exporter's risk to sovereign risk from a commercial
risk.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia's main exports under the BPAs are rubber, food and
beverages, electrical appliances, cocoa powder and palm oil.
</P>
<P>
It said the BPAs have also provided the opportunity for
Malaysian banks to widen their banking network and establish
stronger economic and banking ties with institutions of the
participating economies.
</P>
<P>
To date, 11 designated Malaysian commercial banks have
successfully established some 500 correspondent relationships with
their counterparts in the BPA participating countries, according
to Public Bank.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia's Telecom Demand Expected to Rise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, November 23 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia's
telecommunications industry has room for expansion and service
demand is expected to rise further when the economy recovers,
Public Bank said in its July-August 1998 Economic Review released
here Monday.
</P>
<P>
As Malaysia moves deeper into the information age, the demand
for efficient telecommunications services cannot be
over-emphasized, it said.
</P>
<P>
It said the Multimedia Super Corridor project, which would link
Malaysia to the United States, Japan and Europe through
fiber-optic networks and wireless, digital and satellite
communication systems and the Internet, will provide a boost to
the industry.
</P>
<P>
The review said investments in modern telecommunications
infrastructure would be the key to the Malaysian
telecommunications industry's success.
</P>
<P>
Expenditure for the country's telecommunications infrastructure
between 1996 and 2000 is estimated at 20 billion ringgit (about
5.263 billion U.S. dollars). By the year 2020, the expenditure is
expected to reach between 62.5 billion ringgit (16.45 billion
dollars) and 125 billion ringgit (about 32.89 billion U.S.
dollars), mainly on fiber-optic networks, switching equipment,
digital transmission equipment and cellular technologies.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia's penetration rate of fixed telephone lines, though
still low presently relative to that of developed countries, is
one of the highest in the region following the increased number of
subscribers from 1.4 million in the 1986-1990 period to 3.4
million in the 1991-1995 period.
</P>
<P>
The review said that based on recent estimates, the penetration
rate was around 21 phone lines per 100 persons compared with 16.6
lines per 100 persons in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia's penetration rate is expected to reach 50 telephone
lines per 100 persons by the year 2020 and to reach the ratio, the
industry has to invest as much as 750,000 lines annually.
</P>
<P>
However, it said that despite the prospects, there remain
challenges for the telecommunications industry.
</P>
<P>
To stay ahead, the industry has to keep up with rapid
technological changes and continuously invest in high value-added
services, the review said.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Envoy Returns to Baghdad Amid Dispute on </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, November 23 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan's special envoy to Iraq Prakash Shah returned to Baghdad
Monday amid the disputes on documents between Iraq and U.N. chief
inspector Richard Butler.
</P>
<P>
Shah left Baghdad last Wednesday when U.N. arms inspectors
resumed their routine work for the first day after they returned
to Iraq on Tuesday following the easing of the latest
Iraq-U.N. standoff over weapons inspections.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has said Shah would have to be present when Iraq showed a
document Butler demanded.
</P>
<P>
Iraq insists that the document, which the inspectors believe
provides an inventory of Iraq's chemical weapons during its
1980-88 war with Iran, relates to national security and has
nothing to do with the activities of U.N. arms inspectors.
</P>
<P>
Last week, Butler accused Iraq of pursuing a concealment
policy, saying Iraq had not handed over 12 documents concerning
its chemical and biological programs to the U.N. Special
Commission (UNSCOM) on disarming Iraq.
</P>
<P>
In response, Iraqi Foreign Minister Mohammed Saeed al-Sahhaf
told a press conference on Sunday evening that Iraq had handed
over "all available documents to UNSCOM.
</P>
<P>
Sahhaf said Butler's demands for more document were part of a
savage U.S.-British campaign to keep in place sanctions imposed
on Iraq for eight years.
</P>
<P>
He said Iraq had handed over more than 2.1 million documents to
UNSCOM and the International Atomic Energy Agency.
</P>
<P>
The United States called off air strikes a week ago after Iraq
promised at the last minute to rescind its October 31 decision to
block weapons inspections.

<HEADLINE> Shipping Line Expected to Boost Trade in Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, November 23 (Xinhua) -- Member states of the Common
Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA) are considering
establishing a shipping line to boost maritime trade within the
region, the East African weekly reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
Currently most cargo in the region is being lifted by foreign
lines, which charge high fees and discourage trade between
members, said the report.
</P>
<P>
A six-nation working group on the improvement of shipping
services in the region, which met recently in Lusaka, Zambia,
observed that the volume of trade within COMESA could sustain a
shipping line.
</P>
<P>
The group, which comprised Kenya, Zambia, Tanzania, Mauritius,
Sudan and the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), noted that few
shipping services within the region were operated by indigenous
COMESA citizens.
</P>
<P>
"There are few ships owned by COMESA countries and those
available are old and unreliable," the group said.
</P>
<P>
Kenya and Tanzania both have no vessel-owning shipping lines.
</P>
<P>
The group suggested that COMESA member states which have no
ships consider establishing lines by slot chartering, progressing
to bareboat chartering before finally buying ships.
</P>
<P>
On the commercialization of shipping, the group emphasized the
need for government to leave the operation of commercial shipping
to private operators.
</P>
<P>
The group also discussed the establishment and maintenance of
an information database on shipping services and trade
opportunities in the region, as well as the ratification and
adoption into domestic legislation of the OAU Maritime Transport
Charter.
</P>
<P>
The experts at the meeting also looked at the training and
certification of seagoing and land-based personnel in COMESA
states.

The protected deposits exclude the depositors that have net
debts to the bank, shareholders, directors and officials of ICB,

</P>
<P>
The maximum protected deposit per customer under the insurance
law is a net amount of three million Shillings (3,000 U.S.
Dollars). The net amount per customer is the aggregate of all the
account balances held at the bank.

<P>
BOU Spokesman Walugembe Musoke was quoted by Monday's New
Vision daily as saying that the closed bank will be liquidated.
</P>
<P>
ICB management recently appeared in Parliament and repeatedly
accused the central bank and an audit firm of conspiring to shut
them down. They said their bank was unfairly closed on the basis
of a draft interim report.
</P>
<P>
Parliament summoned the BOU top brass and the auditors, who
denied the ICB's claims of victimization.

<HEADLINE> "Tigers" Claim Responsibility for Swazi Blast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, November 23 (Xinhua) -- An unknown group calling
itself "the Tigers" has claimed responsibility for the Swaziland
bomb blast Friday which killed one person and injured nine
others.
</P>
<P>
An anonymous caller told the Times of Swaziland that the group
had planted Friday's bomb, which destroyed part of the offices of
Deputy Prime Minister Arthur Khoza to force political changes in
the kingdom, the South African press Monday quoted Agence France
Presse as reporting.
</P>
<P>
The caller said the Tigers were also responsible for a blast
on October 28 which destroyed a bridge outside the capital, hours
after King Mswati III had passed by.
</P>
<P>
Authorities believe that the bomb was a botched attempt on the
life of the king, and last week interrogated several opposition
and trade union leaders about the October blast.
</P>
<P>
The caller claimed that Prime Minister Sibusiso Dlamini had
been warned about the blasts, which Dlamini vehemently denied
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Friday's blast occurred soon after King Mswati had sworn in a
new 16-member cabinet, following general elections last month.
</P>
<P>
The landlocked tiny kingdom is under the absolute rule of the
king and political parties have been banned since 1973.
</P>
<P>
Opposition groups have condemned the bombing. A regional
leader of the People's United Democratic Movement (Pudemo) told
the Times of Swaziland that he believed the blast was a ploy by
security agents to discredit the Swaziland Democratic Alliance,
an alliance of opposition parties.
</P>
<P>
Pudemo and other opposition groups had called for a boycott of
last month's elections.

<HEADLINE> Penalty Urged for Fish Poisoning in Lake Victoria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, November 23 (Xinhua) -- The Kenyan fisheries
department and provincial authorities in Nyanza are calling for
stiffer penalties for those caught using chemicals to catch fish
in Lake Victoria.
</P>
<P>
The penalty for poisoning fish in Kenya ranges from three to
six months imprisonment or a fine of 3,000 Shillings
(some 50 U.S. Dollars), a the East African weekly reported
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Fish poisoning was reported in Kenya last April when some
fishermen landed a large catch of fish which was found to be
contaminated when tested by chemist in Nairobi.
</P>
<P>
The poisoning affected mainly tilapia as other species are
said to hibernate in deep waters while tilapia breed and live
near the shores of the lake, the weekly said.
</P>
<P>
The Nynza Provincial Commissioner Peter Raburu claimed some
fisheries officials were condemning the poisoning of fish despite
efforts to stop the practice.
</P>
<P>
Local government needs patrol boats to operate in the lake
night and day to ensure that every beach is under surveillance,
the commissioner said.

LUSAKA, November 23 (Xinhua) -- An economic monitor team has
been set up to assess the running of Zambia's economy.
</P>
<P>
It will be responsible for setting the country's economic
priorities and help the government concentrate on any chosen
area, Zambia Daily Mail reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
A national convention on revitalizing Zambia's economy, which
ended here at the weeked, recommended that the liberal foreign
exchange regime should be regulated and a set of control
mechanisms be set up immediately.
</P>
<P>
If the recommendation, to be presented to president Fredrick
Chiluba, is accepted it will bring to an end of the liberal
foreign exchange policy, which has been blamed for the unstable
exchange rate of the country's currency, Kwacha.
</P>
<P>
The convention also proposed a review of the country's
monetary policy to make it conducive to investment.
</P>
<P>
It proposed that the monetary Policy Committee at the central
bank, the Bank of Zambia, be reconstituted to include members
from different organizations and the Finance Ministry.
</P>
<P>
Each recommendation has been aligned with an organ to carry it
out.
</P>
<P>
The conference also felt very strong that the Zambia
Consolidated Copper Mines (ZCCM) should be privatized, the

<HEADLINE> Oil Producers Urged to Prevent Further Price Fall </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, November 23 (Xinhua) -- Chairman of Iran's State
Expediency Council (SEC) Hashemi Rafsanjani called on oil
producers to make efforts to prevent further oil price slumps, the
official news agency IRNA reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
Rafsanjani made the appeal while meeting with visiting Saudi
Speaker of Shura (Consultative Council) Mohammed Ibn Ibrahim
Jubeir.
</P>
<P>
Iran is ready to cooperate and exchange views with all members
of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC),
particularly Saudi Arabia on the matter, he said.
</P>
<P>
"It is in the interest of oil producing nations, whether
members of OPEC or non-OPEC, to immediately start cooperating and
exchanging views so as to prevent further drop in oil prices and
help reinstate its real prices through a thorough scrutiny and
firm and practical decision," he said.
</P>
<P>
The former Iranian president noted that the continuous trend
of the drop in oil prices is not natural, and the satanic
policies behind the scene are directing the whole affairs to
inflict economic blows to the oil producing nations.
</P>
<P>
Iran is disappointed in the oil price slump after OPEC failed
to save oil prices through output reduction. Some Iranian
officials warned that there is no hope for a recovery in the near
future.
</P>
<P>
On the Tehran-Riyadh relations, Rafsanjani said that Iran
and Saudi Arabia, as two big Muslim countries in the region, have
suitable grounds to further expand bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
Jubeir said that Saudi Arabia attaches great importance to
expanding its relations with Iran and wants to see them promoted.
</P>
<P>
The Saudi Speaker, who arrived here Saturday for a five-day
visit, also expressed hope that the Muslim nations will take major
steps toward Islamic solidarity and consolidation of relations
among them.
</P>
<P>
He also praised Iran for its efforts in defusing the recent
crisis between Turkey and Syria, saying that Iran wisely acted to
preserve the i:17 GMT

<HEADLINE> Iran Denies Visit of U.S. Political Delegation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, November 23 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal
Kharrazi has denied the report that U.S. politicians have joined a
delegation in a recent visit to Iran, local daily Iran News
reported on Monday.
</P>
<P>
"This is totally wrong, none of the members of the group are
political and they are not here for political reasons," Kharrazi
said on Sunday in an exclusive interview with the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
A group of 13 foreign businessmen, mostly Americans, were
attacked by a group of Iranian hardliners early Saturday morning
in northern Tehran and were forced to leave Iran.
</P>
<P>
Iran News said that the unknown assailants, armed with iron
sticks, stopped the car carrying the group and broke the windows
of the car after the group returned to Tehran from a visit to
Isfahan, central Iran.
</P>
<P>
No one was injured in the attack, said the daily.
</P>
<P>
However, the hardliner newspaper Kayhan reported on Sunday
that the Americans are members of the Central Intelligence Agency
and criticized the Iranian Foreign Ministry for allowing American
"spies" to visit Iran.
</P>
<P>
Kharrazi said that the group consisted of Americans and
non-Americans from different countries, who arrived to visit
Iran's tourist sites and perhaps to examine Iran's economic
capacities.
</P>
<P>
Their presence here was not official, the Iranian minister
said, adding "as far as the government is concerned, we have only
issued visas for them."
</P>
<P>
However, Kayhan reported that the group was escorted by
officials from the Iranian Foreign Ministry, who were also
arranging meetings for the Americans with some senior Iranian
officials, including a minister.

<HEADLINE> Shipping Line Expected to Boost Trade in Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, November 23 (Xinhua) -- Member states of the Common
Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA) are considering
establishing a shipping line to boost maritime trade within the
region, the East African weekly reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
Currently most cargo in the region is being lifted by foreign
lines, which charge high fees and discourage trade between
members, said the report.
</P>
<P>
A six-nation working group on the improvement of shipping
services in the region, which met recently in Lusaka, Zambia,
observed that the volume of trade within COMESA could sustain a
shipping line.
</P>
<P>
The group, which comprised Kenya, Zambia, Tanzania, Mauritius,
Sudan and the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), noted that few
shipping services within the region were operated by indigenous
COMESA citizens.
</P>
<P>
"There are few ships owned by COMESA countries and those
available are old and unreliable," the group said.
</P>
<P>
Kenya and Tanzania both have no vessel-owning shipping lines.
</P>
<P>
The group suggested that COMESA member states which have no
ships consider establishing lines by slot chartering, progressing
to bareboat chartering before finally buying ships.
</P>
<P>
On the commercialization of shipping, the group emphasized the
need t and maintenance of
an information database on shipping services and trade
opportunities in the region, as well as the ratification and
adoption into domestic legislation of the OAU Maritime Transport
Charter.
</P>
<P>
The experts at the meeting also looked at the training and
certification of seagoing and land-based personnel in COMESA
states.

KAMPALA, November 23 (Xinhua) -- A total of 10,000 debtors of
the International Credit Bank (ICB), which was closed on
September 18, will be compensated by the Bank of Uganda (BOU)
beginning Monday amid fears that the ICB may be liquidated.
</P>
<P>
A press release from the Bank of Uganda, the central bank,
said all the depositors to be compensated are those eligible for
protection under the deposit insurance scheme.
</P>
<P>
The protected deposits exclude the depositors that have net
debts to the bank, shareholders, directors and officials of ICB,
it added.
</P>
<P>
The maximum protected deposit per customer under the insurance
law is a net amount of three million Shillings (3,000 U.S.
Dollars). The net amount per customer is the aggregate of all the
account balances held at the bank.
</P>
<P>
ICB is a nine-year-old bank with a total deposit of 18 billion
Shillings (18 milliion Dollars) from about 15,000 depositors.
</P>
<P>
BOU Spokesman Walugembe Musoke was quoted by Monday's New
Vision daily as saying that the closed bank will be liquidated.
</P>
<P>
ICB management recently appeared in Parliament and repeatedly
accused the central bank and an audit firm of conspiring to shut
them down. They said their bank was unfairly closed on the basis
of a draft interim report.
</P>

Parliament summoned the BOU top brass and the auditors, who
denied the ICB's claims of victimization.

</P>
<P>
The caller said the Tigers were also responsible for a blast
on October 28 which destroyed a bridge outside the capital, hours
after King Mswati III had passed by.
</P>
<P>
Authorities believe that the bomb was a botched attempt on the
life of the king, and last week interrogated several opposition
and trade union leaders about the October blast.
</P>
<P>
The caller claimed that Prime Minister Sibusiso Dlamini had
been warned about the blasts, which Dlamini vehemently denied
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Friday's blast occurred soon after King Mswati had sworn in a
new 16-member cabinet, following general elections last month.
</P>
<P>
The landlocked tiny kingdom is under the absolute rule of the
king and political parties have been banned since 1973.
</P>
<P>
Opposition groups have condemned the bombing. A regional
leader of the People's United Democratic Movement (Pudemo) told
the Times of Swaziland that he believed the blast was a ploy by
security agents to discredit the Swaziland Democratic Alliance,
an alliance of opposition parties.
</P>
<P>
Pudemo and other opposition groups had called for a boycott of
last month's elections.

<HEADLINE> Penalty Urged for Fish Poisoning in Lake Victoria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, November 23 (Xinhua) -- The Kenyan fisheries
department and provincial authorities in Nyanza are calling for
stiffer penalties for those caught using chemicals to catch fish
in Lake Victoria.
</P>
<P>
The penalty for poisoning fish in Kenya ranges from three to
six months imprisonment or a fine of 3,000 Shillings
(some 50 U.S. Dollars), a the East African weekly reported
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Fish poisoning was reported in Kenya last April when some
fishermen landed a large catch of fish which was found to be
contaminated when tested by chemist in Nairobi.
</P>
<P>
The poisoning affected mainly tilapia as other species are
said to hibernate in deep waters while tilapia breed and live
near the shores of the lake, the weekly said.
</P>
<P>
The Nynza Provincial Commissioner Peter Raburu claimed some
fisheries officials were condemning the poisoning of fish despite
efforts to stop the practice.
</P>
<P>
Local government needs patrol boats to operate in the lake
night and day to ensure that every beach is under surveillance,
the commissioner said.

<HEADLINE> Oil Producers Urged to Prevent Further Price Fall </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, November 23 (Xinhua) -- Chairman of Iran's State
Expediency Council (SEC) Hashemi Rafsanjani called on oil
producers to make efforts to prevent further oil price slumps, the
official news agency IRNA reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
Rafsanjani made the appeal while meeting with visiting Saudi
Speaker of Shura (Consultative Council) Mohammed Ibn Ibrahim
Jubeir.
</P>
<P>
Iran is ready to cooperate and exchange views with all members
of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC),
particularly Saudi Arabia on the matter, he said.
</P>
<P>
"It is in the interest of oil producing nations, whether
members of OPEC or non-OPEC, to immediately start cooperating and
exchanging views so as to prevent further drop in oil prices and
help reinstate its real prices through a thorough scrutiny and
firm and practical decision," he said.
</P>
<P>
The former Iranian president noted that the continuous trend
of the drop in oil prices is not natural, and the satanic
policies behind the scene are directing the whole affairs to
inflict economic blows to the oil producing nations.
</P>
<P>
Iran is disappointed in the oil price slump after OPEC failed
to save oil prices through output reduction. Some Iranian
officials warned that there is no hope for a recovery in the region, have
suitable grounds to further expand bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
Jubeir said that Saudi Arabia attaches great importance to
expanding its relations with Iran and wants to see them promoted.
</P>
<P>
The Saudi Speaker, who arrived here Saturday for a five-day
visit, also expressed hope that the Muslim nations will take major
steps toward Islamic solidarity and consolidation of relations
among them.
</P>
<P>
He also praised Iran for its efforts in defusing the recent
crisis between Turkey and Syria, saying that Iran wisely acted to
preserve the interests and principled stance of the Muslim
community.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Late President's Tragedy Not to Be Repeated in China (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 23 (Xinhua) -- A number of best-sellers,
including Biography of Liu Shaoqi, and The Unjust Case of Liu
Shaoqi were published to commemorate the anniversary of the
centenary of late Chinese President's birth. Both tell the story
of how the President once quoted the Constitution of the People's
Republic of China to protest against persecutions.
</P>
<P>
However, the nominal Constitution in place at the time did not
save the life of the President and he passed away on November 12,
1969.
</P>
<P>
The recently released first publication of the Biography of Liu
Shaoqi discloses for the first time that over 28,000 people
implicated in "Liu's case" were jailed during the Cultural
Revolution (1966-1976).
</P>
<P>
The list included family members, relatives and many people Liu
did not personally know, but who were nontheless charged as
"accomplices."
</P>
<P>
Deng Xiaoping, who also suffered during ridiculous political
campaigns, returned to the political arena in 1978 and ushered in a
new era involving "the construction of a democratic legal system".
</P>
<P>
"Democracy must be systemized and put into law, so systems and
laws will not be altered with a change in leadership, or the
shifting of views and desires of leaders," said Deng.
</P>
<P>
The National People's Congress, China's top legislature, and
its Standing Committee have since adopted some 330-odd
laws. Together with local legislation and regulations promulgated
by the State Council, Chinese people are provided with sufficient
laws governing all aspects of political, economic and social life.
</P>
<P>
Remarkable progress has been made in terms of protecting the
rights and interests of citizens.
</P>
<P>
Chinese people currently enjoy legal protection unprecedented
in the Chinese history, including the right to sue the government
or staffers who violate their rights and interests.
</P>
<P>
"China's legal system has rooted out the possibility of the
recurrence of another Cultural Revolution, and Liu's tragedy will
never happen again," according to Dr. Xiong Xuanguo, a researcher
with the Supreme People's Court.

<P>
TEHRAN, November 23 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal
Kharrazi has denied the report that U.S. politicians have joined a
delegation in a recent visit to Iran, local daily Iran News
reported on Monday.
</P>
<P>
"This is totally wrong, none of the members of the group are
political and they are not here for political reasons," Kharrazi
said on Sunday in an exclusive interview with the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
A group of 13 foreign businessmen, mostly Americans, wan News said that the$
nknown assailants, armed with iron
sticks, stopped the car carrying the group and broke the windows
of the car after the group returned to Tehran from a visit to
Isfahan, central Iran.
</P>
<P>
No one was injured in the attack, said the daily.
</P>
<P>
However, the hardliner newspaper Kayhan reported on Sunday
that the Americans are members of the Central Intelligence Agency
and criticized the Iranian Foreign Ministry for allowing American
"spies" to visit Iran.
</P>
<P>
Kharrazi said that the group consisted of Americans and
non-Americans from different countries, who arrived to visit
Iran's tourist sites and perhaps to examine Iran's economic
capacities.
</P>
<P>
Their presence here was not official, the Iranian minister
said, adding "as far as the government is concerned, we have only
issued visas for them."
</P>
<P>
However, Kayhan reported that the group was escorted by
officials from the Iranian Foreign Ministry, who were also
arranging meetings for the Americans with some senior Iranian
officials, including a minister.

Chinese President Jiang Zemin, who also serves as general
secretary of the CPC Central Committee, noted as the core of the
third generation leadership in China, recorded another big leap
forward by bringing the role of law into full play nationwide.
</P>
<P>
Jiang's work report to the 15th National Congress of the CPC
last year stressed that the Party must pursue the goal of
"administrating the state in accordance with the law and building
a socialist system based on the rule of law."
</P>
<P>
Renowned Chinese jurist Gao Mingxuan was especially delighted
to hear the words "rule of law."
</P>
<P>
"Legal system" and "rule of law", or fazhi, sound the same in
Chinese." However, the latter was previously taboo in the Chinese
legal field, said Gao, who serves as vice president of China Law
Society.
</P>
<P>
"The proposal for the 'rule of law' indicates that the top
leadership is determined to bid farewell to the old system of
"rule by men," he said, adding that "rule of law" means that
administrators of the country must also abide by law.
</P>
<P>
Rule of law is not a tradition of China and various laws may
not be properly enacted due to the long history of feudalist rule.
</P>
<P>
However, China has made recognizable progress in restructuring
its judiciary and strengthening supervision of law enforcement.
</P>
<P>
A law student at the Political Sciences and Law University of
China said he learned for the first time that Liu Shaoqi proposed
the adoption of laws to guarantee the rights of citizens against
abuses by government.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that he gained a greater awareness by watching
documentary on Liu televised nationwide by China Central
Television.
</P>
<P>
"It's a pity that laws were aborted because of chaotic
situation at the time. Otherwise, the Cultural Revolution might
never have happened and Liu would not have been persecuted to
death," according to the student.

<HEADLINE> Tarim River in Danger </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
URUMQI, November 23 (Xinhua) -- Xinjiang's Tarim River, one of
the longest inland rivers in China, is drying up and its water is
becoming undrinkable.
</P>
<P>
The Tarim, known among the people of southern Xinjiang Uygur
Autonomous Region as the "mother river," is now 1,000 kilometers
long, 320 kilometers shorter than it was thirty years ago.
</P>
<P>
What is worse, it has become salty and shallow in the dry
season from March to July and no longer meets the country's
standards for either drinking or irrigation water.
</P>
<P>
This has seriously affected the lives of the people living in
the lower reaches of the river, who now mainly rely on newly built
water diversion projects.
</P>
<P>
Experts point out that the reduced water level and increasing
discharges of waste water from the irrigated areas in the upper
and middle reaches are the main reasons for the worsening water
quality, and they have concluded that the river needs to be
harnessed.
</P>
<P>
As part of this effort, the Autonomous Region recently set up
the Tarim River Water Conservancy Commission for unified
management of the river, and a World Bank irrigation and drainage
program is also under way on the river.

<HEADLINE> Revenue Collections in India to Fall Short of Target </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, November 23 (Xinhua) -- A leading Indian newspaper
said Monday that revenue collections in the country would fall far
short of the target for the current fiscal year (Aril 1, 1998, to
March 31, 1999).
</P>
<P>
In an internal note to the Finance Ministry, the Revenue
Department said that while customs collections were expected to
fall 60 billion rupees (approximately 1.42 billion U.S. dollars)
short of budget estimates, excise would lag by around 50 billion
rupees (about 1.2 billion dollars), The Financial Express
reported.
</P>
<P>
The budget estimates for 1988-99 had put customs receipts at
481.48 billion rupees (11.46 billion dollars) while excise was put
at 576.9 billion rupees (13.735 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
The financial daily quoted an official from the department as
attributing the poor performance on the excise front to a slowdown
in the manufacturing sector and on the customs front to a fall in
international crude oil prices.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the financial performance of the 105
companies in India that had announced their results for the first
half of the fiscal year suggested an intensification of the
economic slowdown in the country.
</P>
<P>
In spite of a year-on-year sales growth of over 20 percent in
the first half, the net profit of these companies declined by 6.9
percent compared with that of the same period last year, an
indication of the increasing squeeze on profit margins.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Private Entrepreneurs Still in Infant Phase, Says Survey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 23 (Xinhua) -- Chinese private entrepreneurs
are economically confident but think of themselves as having low
social reputations and little political standing, according to a
survey by the Economic Restructuring Office of the State Council.
</P>
<P>
The office, formerly known as the State Economic Restructuring
Commission, conducted the survey recently of private entrepreneurs
in Zhejiang, Henan and Gansu provinces, and found that 78.5
percent of them think they have high economic status.
</P>
<P>
But only 22.4 percent think they have high social reputations,
and a scant 5.6 percent regard themselves as highly respected
politically.
</P>
<P>
According to the survey, while 37.9 percent of the respondents
said they have received full support from local governments in
forming economic policies, 6.2 percent said they are forgotten by
local governments, and 55.9 percent replied they are considered by
local governments but this support needs be strengthened.
</P>
<P>
The survey found that 54.7 percent of the private entrepreneurs
were once cadres or technicians in government institutions or
state-owned enterprises.
</P>
<P>
The private sector grew substantially only after 1993, as 63
percent of the questioned businessmen opened their businesses
since then. Only 15.8 percent set up their businesses before 1989,
and 21.2 percent in the 1989-1993 period.
</P>
<P>
An expert from the State Council office concluded that China's
private entrepreneurs are still in an infant and emerging phase,
and are mainly engaged in low-technology industrial sectors.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the average capital of private firms, which now
stands at 306,000 yuan, is just 15.3 percent that of state-owned
small industrial enterprises.
</P>
<P>
So far, private entrepreneurs cannot be seen as a sector which
can play a significant role in building the national economy, and
they are at present too weak to contract, lease or buy up
state-owned industrial enterprises, he said.

<HEADLINE> Visitors to Meet Colorful Terracotta Warriors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, November 23 (Xinhua) -- Visitors to the museum of the
life-size terracotta warriors and horses in Xi'an will soon be
offered an opportunity to enjoy pottery warriors dressed in
colorful suits, a sharp contrast to the figures now on display
which all are of the same grey hue.
</P>
<P>
"We plan to select several pottery armored warriors in dark red
or green dress among those in the best-preserved No. 2 Pit,"
said Zhang Zhongli, deputy curator of the museum.
</P>
<P>
Since 1974, three huge pits have been discovered near the tomb
of Qin Shihuang, the first emperor of Qin Dynasty (221-206 BC).
Several test drillings have shown that a total of 6,000 life-size
pottery figures and horses and numerous bronze weapons lay hidden
in the three pits.
</P>
<P>
At present, more than 1,000 figures and horses have been
unearthed and put on display.
</P>
<P>
Zhang explained that many of the exhibited figures were
colorfully painted at the time they were created. However, when
they were exposed to the air, the painted layer quickly peeled
away.
</P>
<P>
"Before we find an effective way to protect them from exposure
to the air, we can only leave them right there in the pits," he
said.
</P>
<P>
The museum has sent a team of researchers to Germany to study
advanced technology for preserving painted pottery. Once they
return, they will devote themselves to this project.
</P>
<P>
"If everything goes smoothly, visitors will be able to see the
true figures next March," said Zhang, adding that the terracotta
warriors and horses have slept beneath the earth for almost 2,200
years.
</P>
<P>
The museum has received 34 million tourists from both at home
and abroad since it opened in 1979.
</P>
<P>
This historical site has also been listed in as a World
Heritage by the United Nations, and thanks to a flourishing
tourism, villagers nearby all now lead a better life.

SEOUL -- U.S. President Bill Clinton left here for Guam Monday
morning after reiterating his support for South Korea's "gradual
engagement policy" toward the Democratic People's Republic of
Korea (DPRK).
</P>
<P>
Clinton said that he is in full support of South Korean
President Kim Dae-jung's "sunshine policy" toward the DPRK based
on separating politics from business in a bid to push the DPRK
onto the path of reform and open-up. Meanwhile, the

Livingston told NBC's "Meet the Press" that the House could

<HEADLINE> Iran Denies Visit of U.S. Political Delegation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, November 23 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal
Kharrazi has denied the report that U.S. politicians have joined a
delegation in a recent visit to Iran, local daily Iran News
reported on Monday.
</P>
<P>
"This is totally wrong, none of the members of the group are
political and they are not here for political reasons," Kharrazi
said on Sunday in an exclusive interview with the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
A group of 13 foreign businessmen, mostly Americans, were
attacked by a group of Iranian hardliners early Saturday morning
in northern Tehran and were forced to leave Iran.
</P>
<P>
Iran News said that the unknown assailants, armed with iron
sticks, stopped the car carrying the group and broke the windows
of the car after the group returned to Tehran from a visit to
Isfahan, central Iran.
</P>
<P>
No one was injured in the attack, said the daily.
</P>
<P>
However, the hardliner newspaper Kayhan reported on Sunday
that the Americans are members of the Central Intelligence Agency
and criticized the Iranian Foreign Ministry for allowing American
"spies" to visit Iran.
</P>
<P>
Kharrazi said that the group consisted of Americans and
non-Americans from different countries, who arrived to visit
Iran's tourist sites and perhaps to examine Iran's economic
capacities.
</P>
<P>
Their presence here was not official, the Iranian minister
said, adding "as far as the government is concerned, we have only
issued visas for them."
</P>
<P>
However, Kayhan reported that the group was escorted by
officials from the Iranian Foreign Ministry, who were also
arranging meetings for the Americans with some senior Iranian
officials, including a minister.

<HEADLINE> Debtors of Uganda's Closed Bank to Be Paid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, November 23 (Xinhua) -- A total of 10,000 debtors of
the International Credit Bank (ICB), which was closed on
September 18, will be compensated by the Bank of Uganda (BOU)
beginning Monday amid fears that the ICB may be liquidated.
</P>
<P>
A press release from the Bank of Uganda, the central bank,
said all the depositors to be compensated are those eligible for
protection under the deposit insurance scheme.
</P>
<P>
The protected deposits exclude the depositors that have net
debts to the bank, shareholders, directors and officials of ICB,
it added.
</P>
<P>
The maximum protected deposit per customer under the insurance
law is a net amount of three million Shillings (3,000 U.S.
Dollars). The net amount per customer is the aggregate of all the
account balances held at the bank.
</P>
<P>
ICB is a nine-year-old bank with a total deposit of 18 billion
Shillings (18 milliion Dollars) from about 15,000 depositors.
</P>
<P>
BOU Spokesman Walugembe Musoke was quoted by Monday's New
Vision daily as saying that the closed bank will be liquidated.
</P>
<P>
ICB management recently appeared in Parliament and repeatedly
accused the central bank and an audit firm of conspiring to shut
them down. They said their bank was unfairly closed on the basis
of a draft interim report.
</P>
<P>
Parliament summoned the BOU top brass and the auditors, who
denied the ICB's claims of victimization.

<HEADLINE> China Must Conserve Timber Resources, Import More </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 23 (Xinhua) -- China should explore new
channels for importing timber and sparingly use its limited timber
resources in the wake of a logging ban in forests along the
country's two major rivers, the Yangtze and the Yellow, said a
recent issue of the Guangdong-Hong Kong Information Daily.
</P>
<P>
The logging ban along these two rivers is the result of severe
flooding along the Yangtze this summer, and the new policy will
reduce China's timber supply by about 10 million cubic meters.
</P>
<P>
However, the reduction in the timber supply will not be felt
immediately because of the country's stockpile of eight million
cubic meters, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
The article urged China to explore new import markets such as
South America and Africa, adding that Japan and the Republic of
Korea are well ahead of China in these markets.
</P>
<P>
Presently, China's timber imports come mainly from Southeast
Asia and Russia.
</P>
<P>
The paper also urged China to use its timber reserves
sparingly, and use more bamboo, rattan, plastic, stone and steel
to replace timber wherever possible.

<HEADLINE> Overseas Tourists Spend More Than Domestic Tourists </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 23 (Xinhua) -- Overseas tourists spent an
average of 135.11 U.S. dollars a day in China last year, more than
triple that of domestic Chinese tourists, according to a recent
edition of the China Economic Times.
</P>
<P>
Overseas Chinese were the biggest spenders, at 143.29 dollars a
day on average. They were followed by foreigners, Taiwanese
compatriots, and Hong Kong and Macao compatriots, the paper said,
quoting National Tourism Administration officials.
</P>
<P>
By comparison, Chinese tourists spent 328.2 yuan a day
last year, but that figure is much larger than the
195.33 yuan a day on average in 1995, said the paper.
</P>
<P>
The wide spending disparity is related to income levels and
consumption habits and structures, said Wang Lianyi, an expert at
the administration.
</P>
<P>
Wang said the higher income of overseas tourists, as well as
their habit of shopping and collecting souvenirs when they travel,
results in their higher spending than domestic Chinese.
</P>
<P>
Tourist shopping expenditure accounts for about 60 percent of the
tourism industry revenue in some advanced countries, but the
rate is less than 20 percent in China, Wang said.

CANBERRA, November 23 (Xinhua) -- Board members of the Sydney

minister Michael Knight said in Sydney on Monday.

<HEADLINE> "Tigers" Claim Responsibility for Swazi Blast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, November 23 (Xinhua) -- An unknown group calling
itself "the Tigers" has claimed responsibility for the Swaziland
bomb blast Friday which killed one person and injured nine
others.
</P>
<P>
An anonymous caller told the Times of Swaziland that the group
had planted Friday's bomb, which destroyed part of the offices of
Deputy Prime Minister Arthur Khoza to force political changes in
the kingdom, the South African press Monday quoted Agence France
Presse as reporting.
</P>
<P>
The caller said the Tigers were also responsible for a blast
on October 28 which destroyed a bridge outside the capital, hours
after King Mswati III had passed by.
</P>
<P>
Authorities believe that the bomb was a botched attempt on the
life of the king, and last week interrogated several opposition
and trade union leaders about the October blast.
</P>
<P>
The caller claimed that Prime Minister Sibusiso Dlamini had
been warned about the blasts, which Dlamini vehemently denied
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Friday's blast occurred soon after King Mswati had sworn in a
new 16-member cabinet, following general elections last month.
</P>
<P>
The landlocked tiny kingdom is under the absolute rule of the
king and political parties have been banned since 1973.
</P>
<P>
Opposition groups have condemned the bombing. A regional
leader of the People's United Democratic Movement (Pudemo) told
the Times of Swaziland that he believed the blast was a ploy by
security agents to discredit the Swaziland Democratic Alliance,
an alliance of opposition parties.
</P>
<P>
Pudemo and other opposition groups had called for a boycott of
last month's elections.

<HEADLINE> British Airlines Compete for Shanghai-London Route </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, November 23 (Xinhua) --Virgin Atlantic Airways,
Britain's second largest long-range international airline company,
has launched a number of activities hoping to obtain the rights to
fly the Shanghai-London route.
</P>
<P>
Virgin Group chairman, Richard Branson, recently went to
Shanghai where he met with local officials, negotiated with local
air transport companies, brought model planes bearing the Virgin
Atlantic Airways logo to the Bund, and introduced his company and
its plan to operate the Shanghai-London route to local residents.
</P>
<P>
Late last month in Shanghai, representatives of British Airways
also announced its plan to run the Shanghai-London air service.
</P>
<P>
The head of Virgin Atlantic was confident of achieving a
success in operating this route, saying Shanghai is witnessing an
economic boom and a swift increase in the number of airline
passengers.
</P>
<P>
He said Virgin Atlantic will further discuss commercial
cooperation plans with China Eastern Airlines, and conduct
educational and commercial exchanges with them.
</P>
<P>
Virgin Atlantic will penetrate the Chinese market with Shanghai
as a starting point, said the Virgin Atlantic chief, adding that
he hopes not only to land Virgin planes in China, but to open a
supermarket, a cinema and a teahouse in Shanghai as well.
</P>
<P>
During British prime minister Tony Blair's autumn visit to
China, the Chinese and British governments signed a new bilateral
aviation service agreement approving direct air service from
Shanghai to London, which is expected to open no later than April
next year.
</P>
<P>
The Shanghai-London route will initially be offered twice
weekly, and will be increased to four regularly scheduled flights
a week by the year 2000.

<HEADLINE> Penalty Urged for Fish Poisoning in Lake Victoria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, November 23 (Xinhua) -- The Kenyan fisheries
department and provincial authorities in Nyanza are calling for
stiffer penalties for those caught using chemicals to catch fish
in Lake Victoria.
</P>
<P>
The penalty for poisoning fish in Kenya ranges from three to
six months imprisonment or a fine of 3,000 Shillings
(some 50 U.S. Dollars), a the East African weekly reported
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Fish poisoning was reported in Kenya last April when some
fishermen landed a large catch of fish which was found to be
contaminated when tested by chemist in Nairobi.
</P>
<P>
The poisoning affected mainly tilapia as other species are
said to hibernate in deep waters while tilapia breed and live
near the shores of the lake, the weekly said.
</P>
<P>
The Nynza Provincial Commissioner Peter Raburu claimed some
fisheries officials were condemning the poisoning of fish despite
efforts to stop the practice.
</P>
<P>
Local government needs patrol boats to operate in the lake
night and day to ensure that every beach is under surveillance,
the commissioner said.

HAIKOU, November 23 (Xinhua) -- Hainan, China's southernmost
island province has witnessed a dramatic increase in tourists
coming from overseas, with the number of arrivals growing by 20.8
percent annually over the past 10 years.
</P>
<P>
The island province hosted 2.1 million tourists in 1997, up
5.6-folds on the 1987 figure. Hainan's tourism earning for the year
hit 1.28 billion yuan, 15.2 times the 1987 level.
</P>
<P>
Some 1.93 million tourists visited the island during the
January-October period in spite of the financial crisis sweeping
Asia, up 9.5 percent on an annual basis.
</P>
<P>
The tourism sector currently accounts for 12 percent of local
GDP, a level much higher than the national average of only three
percent.
</P>
<P>
Hainan's 84 hotels, including two five-stars and two
four-stars, represent a substantial rise on only 12 in 1987.
</P>
<P>
The tourism boom has been attributed to the island's extensive
tropical tourism resources, as well as colorful folk culture,
ethnic folk customs and improved infrastructure.

<P>
HARARE, November 23 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's Vice-President
Simon Muzenda has urged young boys and girls to undergo HIV-AIDS
tests before marriage to avoid risks in their adult life.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the launch on Sunday of the Masvingo provincial

pandemic is threatening to wipe out the entire middle age
generation in the country, the Daily Herald reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
He said, "I know how frightened you are to undergo an aids
test but what are you going to do about this problem? "

<HEADLINE> Shipping Line Expected to Boost Trade in Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, November 23 (Xinhua) -- Member states of the Common
Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA) are considering
establishing a shipping line to boost maritime trade within the
region, the East African weekly reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
Currently most cargo in the region is being lifted by foreign
lines, which charge high fees and discourage trade between
members, said the report.
</P>
<P>
A six-nation working group on the improvement of shipping
services in the region, which met recently in Lusaka, Zambia,
observed that the volume of trade within COMESA could sustain a
shipping line.
</P>
<P>
The group, which comprised Kenya, Zambia, Tanzania, Mauritius,
Sudan and the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), noted that few
shipping services within the region were operated by indigenous
COMESA citizens.
</P>
<P>
"There are few ships owned by COMESA countries and those
available are old and unreliable," the group said.
</P>
<P>
Kenya and Tanzania both have no vessel-owning shipping lines.
</P>
<P>
The group suggested that COMESA member states which have no
ships consider establishing lines by slot chartering, progressing
to bareboat chartering before finally buying ships.
</P>
<P>
On the commercialization of shipping, the group emphasized the
need for government to leave the operation of commercial shipping
to private operators.
</P>
<P>
The group also discussed the establishment and maintenance of
an information database on shipping services and trade
opportunities in the region, as well as the ratification and
adoption into domestic legislation of the OAU Maritime Transport
Charter.
</P>
<P>
The experts at the meeting also looked at the training and
certification of seagoing and land-based personnel in COMESA
states.

<HEADLINE> Shandong's Fall in Exports Slows Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JINAN, November 23 (Xinhua) -- East China's Shandong Province
exported 1.26 billion U.S. dollars worth of goods in October, a
rise of more than 17 percent over the same month in 1997.
</P>
<P>
This increase indicates a slowdown of falling local exports
this year, according to the provincial commission for foreign
trade and economic cooperation.
</P>
<P>
During the first ten months of the year, local exports dropped
1.3 percent on a yearly basis to 10.87 billion dollars, against a
3.3 percent year-on-year decrease for the first nine months of the
year.
</P>
<P>
The slowdown is attributed to the rise of export business done
by local overseas-funded companies, which exported 5.68 billion
dollars worth of goods in the ten months, 120 million dollars
higher than the same 1997 period.
</P>
<P>
In addition to increasing exports to American and European
markets, the province is still keen on Asian markets. During the
first ten-month period, local exports to the rest of Asia reached
6.61 billion dollars, slightly more than the previous month.
</P>
<P>
The rebound of exports of bulk commodities is another reason
for the slowdown of fall in local exports.

<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, November 23 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia's Foreign
Ministry Monday summoned U.S. Ambassador John R. Malott here to
express the country's views on a statement made by U.S. Vice
President Al Gore supporting an anti-government "reform" group.
</P>
<P>
"We reiterated Malaysia's position that Gore's speech was an
incitement of lawlessness and not simply a call of democracy as
claimed...," Foreign Ministry Undersecretary for Americas John
Tenewi Nuek was quoted by the Malaysian national news agency
Bernama as saying.
</P>
<P>
Malott was summoned to the Foreign Ministry Monday noon for
Malaysia's views to be expressed following Malott's statement in a
recent interview with The Star newspaper concerning Gore's speech.
</P>
<P>
In the November 20 interview, Malott, when asked if the United
States did not consider Malaysia a democratic country, said
democracy was not simply having elections.
</P>
<P>
Nuek said Malott was told that Malaysians were "shocked" by his
statement which appeared to question Malaysia's democratic system.
</P>
<P>
Nuek said Malaysia rejected Malott's idea that any country
could say anything about another country.
</P>
<P>
However, Nuek said he told Malott that Malaysian-U.S. ties
remained "very substantive and full of potentialities which we
could further expand."
</P>
<P>
The U.S. vice president praised former Malaysian Deputy Prime
Minister Anwar Ibrahim's supporters who have been taking to the
streets as "brave" during a speech at the APEC Business Advisory
Council dinner here just a week ago.
</P>
<P>
Gore's remarks triggered an outrage from Malaysians including
political and business leaders, who blasted Gore for interfering
in the internal affairs of Malaysia.

</P>
<P>
Provincial officials also attributed the boom in forest parks
to the exploitation of forest resources, the development of "green
food," and enhancement of environmental-protection awareness.

<P>
WELLINGTON, November 23 (Xinhua) -- Confidence in New Zealand's
housing market has reached a three-year high, suggesting the
bottom of the housing cycle may have passed, local ASB Bank said
in a survey report, which was released here Monday.
</P>
<P>
The bank's latest quarterly survey of housing intentions for
the three months to October showed confidence in the housing
market was at its highest point since the survey began three
years ago. The survey asked respondents whether "they think it is
a good or bad time to buy a house."
</P>
<P>
Optimism increased significantly across all regions in the
country. In the survey, 63 percent of respondents thought it was a
good time to buy a house, while 11 percent thought it was a bad
time. That made a net 52 percent approval rating, compared with 23
percent in last July.
</P>
<P>
Optimism in Wellington showed the most marked improvement from
four percent in the previous survey to 44 percent in this latest
survey.
</P>
<P>
However, it still lagged behind other regions, remaining the
least optimistic area.
</P>
<P>
Auckland and Christchurch had similar levels of optimism of 55
percent and 53 percent respectively.
</P>
<P>
It is believed that the surging confidence in housing market
can be attributed to low floating mortgage rates and house prices
in the country.

Wellington, November 23 (Xinhua) -- Wellington port earned 1.39
 million New Zealand dollars (750,000 U.S. dollars) in the third
quarter of this year, compared with 632,000 N.Z. dollars (340,000
U.S. dollars) in the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
The Evening Post Monday said that cost cutting and higher
freight volumes helped Wellington port double its after-tax
profit.
</P>
<P>
The Wellington-based newspaper quoted port chief executive Ken
Harris as saying that log volumes were starting to pick up due to
rising demand from the republic of Korea and new markets in China
and India.
</P>
<P>
He also attributed the profit growth to changes in shipping
routes which helped lift total freight volumes and reduce costs.
</P>
<P>
Harris said that the port would be launching one or two new
businesses next year, looking for further efficiencies and
opportunities to boost trade.
</P>
<P>
Wellington port is 76.9 percent owned by Wellington Regional
Council and 23.1 percent by Manawatu-Wanganui Regional Council.

<HEADLINE> Thais May Originate from China, Chinese Ethnologist </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANNING, November 23 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese ethnologist believes
that the ancestors of today's Thais possibly came from China.
</P>
<P>
Tan Shengmin, deputy director of the Nationality Institute of
the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region in south China, came to this
conclusion based on his research comparing the Thais and China's
Zhuang nationality.
</P>
<P>
Tan made his comparison by choosing 200 basic words from the
Thais and the Zhuang vocabularies, and found that the Thai and
Zhuang languages clearly have the same origin.
</P>
<P>
Another comparison of 2,000 basic words shows that some 75
percent of these have the same or similar pronunciations. "In
terms of the origin of nationality, the Thais and Zhuang people
must have lived together," Tan said.
</P>
<P>
The Zhuang is the second largest nationality in China, with a
population of 17 million. The Thais constitute the largest
nationality in Thailand, and their language is the official
language of the country.
</P>
<P>
Tan also used the research of historians, archeologists,
paleoanthropologists, and ethnologist for reference in his study.
</P>
<P>
Tan said the ancestors of the Thais and Zhuang nationalities
originated from two branches, the Xi'ou and the Luoyue, of the
ancient Baiyue Ethnic Group which lived 3,000 years ago in south
China (today's Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region and Guangdong
Province).
</P>
<P>
Between the third and ninth centuries, the two nationalities
separated and the Thais moved into the northern part of today's
Thailand via Viet Nam and Laos.
</P>
<P>
There, the Thais established a kingdom in the 13th century,
united all of Thailand, and made Thai the official language.
</P>
<P>
There are now five different schools of thought about the
origin of the Thais, and three of them hold they originally came
from China.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka Helps Canada Seize Smuggled Hashish </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, November 23 (Xinhua) -- The Royal Canadian Mounted
Police (RCMP) have seized 11.8 tons of hashish in the north
Pacific with information provided by Sri Lanka, reports reaching
here said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lanka is said to be a key transit point on the global drug
trafficking route, according to a senior officer from the Police
Narcotics Bureau (PNB) of Sri Lanka.
</P>
<P>
With information provided by the PNB, the RCMP in the early
hours of November 4 arrested six persons and seized the hashish
which was being loaded into a lorry at a place called Fanny Bay,
said the reports.
</P>
<P>
With the Fanny Bay raid, the RCMP launched a series of
crackdown on the hideouts at Vancouver and Vancouver Island of the
drug smugglers who are believed to have been conducting illegal
drug dealing over a period of time.
</P>
<P>
The PNB assistance was sought by the RCMP in early April this
year when the Blue Dawn first anchored in the Galle Harbor, South
of Sri Lanka, for repairs after arriving from Male, the capital of
the Maldives.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, PNB also assisted the Dutch police to round up a Dutch
gang involved in drug smuggling, the reports added.

KATHMANDU, November 23 (Xinhua) -- A six-member Nepali team led
by Home Minister Govind Raj Joshi left here Monday for Thimpu,
capital of Bhutan, for a good-will visit.
</P>
<P>
Nepali Ambassador to Bhutan Bhes Bahadur Thapa, who is included
in the delegation, said that it is a good-will visit which will
cover everything including the refugee issue.
</P>
<P>
The two countries formed a Joint Ministerial Level Committee in
July 1993 to address the refugee issue, which emerged after
100,000 people were forced to flee Bhutan in 1989 and early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
The seventh round of ministerial talks between the two
countries reached a deadlock in April 1996 when then Nepali
Foreign Minister Prakash Chandra Lohani declared the refugees
"stateless people."
</P>
<P>
The refugees are staying in eight U.N.-run camps in eastern
Nepal.
</P>
<P>
Bhutan said that it would take back only those of genuine
Bhutanese origin.

<HEADLINE> U.S. President Ends Visit to S. Korea </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, November 23 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton left
here for Guam Monday morning after reiterating his support for
South Korea's "gradual engagement policy" toward the Democratic
People's Republic of Korea (DPRK).
</P>
<P>
Clinton said that he is in full support of South Korean
President Kim Dae-jung's "sunshine policy" toward the DPRK based
on separating politics from business in a bid to push the DPRK
onto the path of reform and open-up.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the U.S. president, who arrived here last Friday for
a two-day visit, urged the DPRK to give full access to a suspected
nuclear facility.
</P>
<P>
"It (DPRK) must comply with the obligation on nuclear
nonproliferation," said Clinton, stressing that the DPRK also
must stop its efforts to develop and proliferate chemical and
biological weapons and ballistic missiles.
</P>
<P>
"I hope the North Koreans will not do anything to force us to
our policy," said he.
</P>
<P>
Construction of an underground facility in Kumchangri, some 40
kilometers northwest of the DPRK's main nuclear complex, Yongbyon,
has caused great concerns in South Korea, Japan and the United
States, which feared it might be related to nuclear arms
development.
</P>
<P>
Suspicions of the DPRK's nuclear facility has fueled new
challenges to the engagement policy toward Pyongyang. The
Republican-controlled U.S. Congress and South Korean opposition
party are leading the attacks on the policy.
</P>
<P>
Under the Geneva Agreement signed in 1994, the DPRK is obliged
to freeze all its nuclear programs in return for receiving two
light-water reactors and heavy fuel oil.
</P>
<P>
Pyongyang has demanded that Washington pay 300 million
U.S. dollars in exchange for allowing inspection of the
underground site. But the U.S. government has flatly rejected it.
</P>
<P>
Clinton also inspected the U.S. troops stationed in South Korea
during his visit.
</P>
<P>
On economic issues, Clinton praised President Kim's efforts to
address the financial crisis and bring South Korea back to the
path of economic growth.
</P>
<P>
However, he appealed to the South Korean family-owned
conglomerates, or chaebols, to speed up restructuring and urged
the South Korean government to open its market wider and curb
unfair trade practices and subsidization in sensitive sectors like
steel and semiconductors.
</P>
<P>
South Korea is the last leg of Clinton's Asia trip, which has
taken him to Japan.

<P>
CHONGQING, November 23 (Xinhua) -- Reconstruction in flood-hit
Chongqing municipality in southwest China has paid off as the
city's industrial and agricultural sectors have resumed production.
</P>
<P>
Over 90 percent of the factories put out of business by this
summer's severe flooding are now back to normal production, and
public facilities destroyed by the floods have been fully
restored, according to local officials.
</P>
<P>
Chongqing was hit hard by the rain-fed flooding of the Yangtze
River this summer, with direct losses running to more than seven
billion yuan (846 million U.S. dollars). By the end of August,
some 20 million people had been affected by the floods and more
than 210,000 had become homeless.
</P>
<P>
As part of a relief effort, 340,000 houses have been built
for the flood victims and another 70,000 are still under
construction. All the homeless will be accommodated by the Spring
Festival in February -- the most significant holiday on the
Chinese lunar calendar, according to the municipal government.
</P>
<P>
The central government has provided financial support for the
reconstruction in Chongqing, and the municipal government has
allocated a large proportion of its revenue for relief funds. These
funds now amount to 200 million yuan, and insurance
companies have paid more than 80 million yuan in compensation.

HARBIN, November 23 (Xinhua) -- The Heilongjiang Reclamation
Area, which used to be known as the "Great Northern Wilderness,"
has emerged as one of China's leading paddy rice growers.
</P>
<P>
This area, covering two million hectares in northeast China's
Heilongjiang Province, is a frigid zone unsuitable for rice
growing in the past, until local agronomists developed a series of
special cultivation methods for growing paddy rice there in the
early 1990s. The methods proved successful, but the output
remained low because of poor land and soil erosion.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, state farms in the area adopted a
sparse-planting technique which raised the per-hectare yield to
7,230 kilos this year.
</P>
<P>
Now, the patty-rice area sown in the region was expanded to
nearly 660,000 hectares this year, turning 4.76 billion kilos of
rice, which was 54 percent of the total grain and bean output of
the province.

<HEADLINE> Thailand to Ask U.S. to Amend Law on Shrimp Import </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, November 23 (Xinhua) -- Thailand will press the United
States to speed up the amendment of its domestic laws related to
shrimp import, a newspaper Monday quoted an official from the
Commerce Ministry as saying.
</P>
<P>
The Bangkok Post reported that Thailand wants the requirements
by the United States for certification of shrimp originating in
Thailand, Malaysia, India and Pakistan be eliminated.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in October, an appeal panel of the World Trade
Organization (WTO) ruled that the United States was justified in
having a law designed to protect sea turtles from being killed by
shrimping fleets.
</P>
<P>
However, the panel said Washington was applying the law
selectively against certain countries, which amounted to a trade
barrier.
</P>
<P>
The ruling was a response to a complaint filed by the
above-mentioned four countries.
</P>
<P>
The sea turtle issue has been largely resolved as most
countries, including Thailand, have taken steps to ensure that
their shrimping fleets are equipped with nets that allow turtles
to escape.
</P>
<P>
However, Washington also requires farmed shrimp, which accounts
for nearly 75 percent of Thailand's shrimp exports, to be
certified before being allowed into the U.S. market.
</P>
<P>
The official said the United States was moving very slowly to
amend its laws and regulations, though the WTO required that
amendments be made within 15 to 18 months of a ruling.
</P>
<P>
The WTO wants Washington to negotiate agreements on the
protection of turtles and other issues related to shrimping,
rather than singling out certain countries for sanctions.
</P>
<P>
The United States has in fact asked Thailand to sign a
multilateral agreement on sea turtles. But Thailand says it has
already made similar agreements at the regional level, and that
Washington's conditions are too tough.

<HEADLINE> South China County Becomes Major Aquiculture Base </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, November 23 (Xinhua) -- The county of Dianbai, one
of the leading aquatic producers in south China's Guangdong
Province, is expected to harvest a bumper 389,000 tons of aquatic
products this year, an 18 percent rise over 1997.
</P>
<P>
More than half of this total, 214,000 tons, will come from sea
products cultured in freshwater or in local tidal areas, and this
is the second year that the locally cultured aquatic harvest will
surpass that from the ocean.
</P>
<P>
The county turned out 330,000 tons of marine products last
year, 166,000 tons of which were cultured.
</P>
<P>
In addition to deep-sea fishing, the county is interested in
the development of local tidal areas as well in order to ensure
the sustained growth of the local maritime economy.
</P>
<P>
Dianbai has now developed 12,000 hectares of tidal areas for
breeding aquatic products and set up three culturing sites,
bringing the total number of sites of this type in the province to
eight.
</P>
<P>
It also has invested 23 million yuan setting up 6,800 square
meters of wholesale markets for fishery products. Some 300 tons of
these products are transported domestically each day, and more
than 20,000 products in over 30 varieties are shipped overseas
annually.

with the facilities.
</P>
<P>
However, the details including the prices of the cards have yet
to be worked out, he said.
</P>
<P>
Suthep said the project will give the public an opportunity to
seek knowledge especially students and those who cannot afford to
buy their own computers.

<HEADLINE> Project Elephant Proposed to Save S. Lanka's Jumbos </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, November 23 (Xinhua)-- Two senior conservationists
have proposed a Project Elephant as an urgent priority to save
elephants from extinction in Sri Lanka, the official Daily News
reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The two conservationists Charles Santiapillai and Jayantha
Jayewardene made the proposal at a meeting on evolving a national
policy on managing the Sri Lanka elephant, which was conducted by
the Public Administration, Home Affairs and Plantation Industries
Ministry in Colombo last week, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The key component of the Project Elephant must be accommodation
of the needs of elephants and human beings wherever possible in
order to minimize human-elephant conflict that is responsible for
much of the elephant mortality in Sri Lanka, they were quoted as
saying.
</P>
<P>
The two conservationists have proposed among other things that
Elephant Control Units (ECU) in human-elephant conflict areas be
established and the Wilpattu National Park, the biggest nature
reserve in the country, be made a Peace Park, in conflict areas
under the auspices of International Committee of Red Cross.
</P>
<P>
There were about 10,000 elephants in sri Lanka's tropical
jungles at beginning of this century, but now the estimated
elephant population in the country is around 3,000. Elephants are
being lost at the rate of four to five percent a year, which is
between 120 to 150 animals a year or between 2.3 to 2.9 animals
per week, they warned.

<HEADLINE> Reform Anniversary Attracts Journalists </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HEFEI, November 23 (Xinhua) -- The 20th anniversary of China's
reform is rapidly approaching and, Fengyang County in east
China's Anhui Province has attracted an increasing number of
journalists from both at home and abroad.
</P>
<P>
The correspondents visit the county for personal glimpse of the
past and present in the cradle of Chinese reform.
</P>
<P>
In November 1978, when the Communist Party of China was busy
preparing for the landmarking Third Plenary Session of the
Eleventh Central Committee in November 1978 and starving farmers
in the village of Xiaogang in Fengyang were risking their lives by
attending secret meetings.
</P>
<P>
They reached an epoch-making decision to break farmland
belonging to the then local People's Commune into smaller pieces
in order to let each family live on the fruits of their own labor.
</P>
<P>
The move represented a stunning contrast to the decades-old
practice of all Chinese eating from the same "Big Rice Pot" in
total deference to efficiency and results.
</P>
<P>
Fengyang is widely recognized as the birthplace of the renowned
responsibility system which has been introduced to rural and urban
areas throughout the country.
</P>
<P>
Fengyang is also mentioned in discussions about reform and
reason for the increasing number of visits by reporters.
</P>
<P>
Since September 1997, more than 1,000 Chinese and overseas
journalists from media giants like Xinhua News Agency, People's
Daily and China Central Television as well as CNN, the New York
Times and Asashi Shimbun have visited the county since 1997.

325,800 square kilometers, China's largest amount of nature
reserves.
</P>

<HEADLINE> China Adds More Grain Warehouses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 23 (Xinhua) -- China is expected to complete
construction of 388 new grain warehouses by the end of the year,
which will become operational before the summer harvest of next
year, " China Daily" reports today.
</P>
<P>
More than half of the construction projects were under way by
the end of October. The project, which will store 25 billion kg of
grain in state reserve, aims at alleviating acute shortage of
grain storage capacity and ensuring national food security, the
paper quoted an official with the State Grain Reserve Bureau.
</P>
<P>
The construction program is also designed to strengthen the
government's macroeconomic control of the grain industry.
</P>
<P>
The 15 billion yuan (1.8 billion U.S. dollars) investment in
the food storage projects is expected to boost national economic
growth. The fund is part of the 100 billion yuan raised during the
latest treasury bond issue. About 500 million yuan were allocated
annually in past years for grain warehouses for state reserves,
less than the required funding.
</P>
<P>
China has 15 special warehouses for state grain reserves
capable of storing 0.02 percent of the reserves. The rest is
stored in rented facilities.
</P>
<P>
Grain warehouses are being constructed along railways, ports and
grain production and distribution bases. Expansion of existing
facilities will generate more than 73 percent of the increased
storage capacity.

<HEADLINE> Tibet Vows to Be Self-Reliant on Grain, Oil, Meat by 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, November 23 (Xinhua) -- Southwest China's Tibet
Autonomous Region will achieve self-reliance for grain, edible oil
and meat by the end of the century.
</P>
<P>
Yang Chuantang, vice-chairman of the regional government,
pledged at the weekend that Tibet will make greater efforts to
develop productive forces in farming and animal husbandry in order
to reach the goal.
</P>
<P>
Farming and animal husbandry account for 99 percent of Tibet's
gross domestic product, with farmers and herdsmen accounting for
over 80 percent of the local population, according to the official.
</P>
<P>
Farming and husbandry products also account for 80 percent of
the regional total, said Yang.
</P>
<P>
Tibet has experienced good harvests for 11 straight years, said
Yang, adding that this year's grain output stands at 850,000 tons,
up seven percent on the previous year. Official figures also show
a per capita grain output of 350 kilograms.
</P>
<P>
Tibet produced 38,000 tons of edible oil in 1997, with the per
capita production of meat and milk both ranking first among all
provinces, municipalities and ethnic regions in China.
</P>
<P>
Yang said the regional government will increase investment in
agriculture and animal husbandry, and will continue to popularize
farming technology developed by both local and foreign
scientists.

<HEADLINE> Green Tea Considered As Potential Protectant Against Cancer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, November 22 (Xinhua) -- Green tea as an
antioxidant-carrying plant has aroused attention in cancer
research in the United States, a U.S. journal said in a review.
</P>
<P>
The review, published in the latest issue of Nutrition and
Cancer, focused on studies of green tea in humans and examined 31
of them. The journal reviewed current findings of the effect of
nutrition on the etiology, therapy and prevention of cancer.
</P>
<P>
Human studies are somewhat limited with mixed results,
according to the review.
</P>
<P>
Of the 28 studies investigated, 17 found an inverse association
between green tea and cancer. Seven are positive; three shows no
association, and five are positive with hot temperature. Two
additional human research studies suggested that green tea
polyphenols may have anticarcinogenic effects on nitrosation or
chromosome damage.
</P>
<P>
There are some interesting and encouraging findings regarding
inverse association with various cancers, in particular colon and
possibly stomach and urinary bladder cancers, the review said.
</P>
<P>
Although human studies have their limitations, the review said,
the research has warranted a further look into the effects of
green tea and cancer.
</P>
<P>
The limitations of the human studies are that they are mainly
case-control studies, relying largely on interview and subject
responses. Many of the findings indicate an inverse association
between tea and cancer, but the effect of tea consumption on
cancer may depend on the causative factors of the specific
cancer. Additional comprehensive studies, such as cohort studies,
are needed, the review said.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the second International Scientific Symposium of
Tea and Human Health in Washington, D.C. in September,
U.S. researcher John Weisburger said that the antioxidants in tea
prevent the formation of hazardous products that occur in the body
during normal metabolic reactions, and they lower the formation of
these dangerous oxidized form of chemicals that may cause cancer
in the human body.
</P>
<P>
Tea is the world's most popular beverage only next to
water. Green tea, which is unfermented, remains the most popular
tea in Asian countries such as China and Japan. About 90 percent
of the world's green tea is produced in China.

BEIJING, November 23 (Xinhua) -- An unprecedentedly massive
construction campaign for water resources conservation projects is
underway in China, an effort that's not surprising after this

To date 1.45 billion work days have been recorded for
post-flood water resources construction.
</P>
<P>
A total of 8.91 billion yuan has been invested in these
projects, about a 50 percent increase over last year. Of this
total, 4.15 billion yuan has been invested by local governments,
and the rest by the local residents.
</P>
<P>
The sources said that leaders in flood-prone provinces and
autonomous regions have all personally mobilized water
conservation construction campaigns, and the governor of Anhui
Province, for example, is acting as the head of the campaign there.

<P>
XIAMEN, November 23 (Xinhua) -- Investment from the United
States in the city of Xiamen, one of China's five special economic
zones, in Fujian Province, has now reached 1.09 billion
U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
A city government official said that U.S. is the third among
the 29 overseas investors in Xiamen, after Hong Kong and Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
About 124 enterprises with U.S. capital have been set up in
Xiamen since the first, funded by Coca Cola, came in 1982.
</P>
<P>
The official said that there was a new upsurge in
U.S.investment in 1997, from Kodak, Allied Signal, General
Electrics, and Boeing. The Kodak industrial park, with 650 million
U.S. dollars of Kodak's money, is Xiamen's largest project backed
by an American company.
</P>
<P>
The increasing U.S. investment has diversified the overseas
investment in Xiamen, which was formerly dominated by Taiwanese,
Singaporean, and Hong Kong funds.

<HEADLINE> Hamdooon: Iraq to Respond to UN on Documents </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, November 22 (Xinhua) -- Iraq would respond
formally to the United Nations on the documents requested by Chief
U.N. weapons inspector Richard Butler, Iraq's Ambassador to the
United Nations, Nizar Hamdoon, said on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the American Broadcasting Company, Hamdoon
said Iraq would on Monday answer the requests of Butler, Executive
Chairman of the United Nations Special Commission (UNSCOM) in
charge of dismantling Iraq's weapons of mass destruction, for
documents in a response to the U.N. Security Council.
</P>
<P>
Hamdoon said Iraq was cooperating with the U.N. arms
inspectors, and the documents requested by Butler were destroyed
or were missing after the Gulf War. "We do not have them," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Hamdoon said Iraq faced a problem of trying to prove the
negative. "I think it is almost impossible. The problem here is
lack of the trust that we have on both sides of the issue, I
believe. We will try to find a way of getting the U.N.
Secretary-General more involved, getting the Security Council more
involved, probably will bridge that gap."
</P>
<P>
He acknowledged that one Air Force document, a handbook of
notes taken by a sergeant in the 1980s, did exist, and that Iraq
had made it available to U.N. arms inspectors to make notes but
"now that are insisting on having a copy."
</P>
<P>
"Butler is now focusing on documentation as if to undocument
Iraq is the issue here, and not to disarm it," Hamdoon said.
</P>
<P>
Hamdoon repeated that Iraq took seriously the threat of U.S.
attacks. "We have no illusions about the willingness of the
American administration for a military strike," he added.
</P>
<P>
Butler had asked for documents about Iraq's prohibited arms
programs, but Iraq initially called the request "provocative"
and "unprofessional".

<P>
WASHINGTON, November 22 (Xinhua) -- Martina Hingis of
Switzerland beat Lindsay Davenport of the United States in the
final of the Chase Championships Sunday in New York.
</P>
<P>
The former world No. 1 beat the world top player 7-5, 6-4,
4-6, 6-2 to win the 500,000 U.S. dollars top prize. Davenport
got 250,000 dollars.
</P>
<P>
Despite the loss, Davenport still holds the top spot in the
world this year.
</P>
<P>
After taking the first two sets, Hingis gave up the third on
purpose, but rallied back strongly to win the fourth.
</P>
<P>
The two met five times in 1998, with Davenport winning three.
Today's final was a rematch of the U.S. Open final this year, and
Hingis took a sweet revenge to her rival.
</P>
<P>
The 18-year-old Hingis won five tournaments this year to
Davenport's six. It was Hingis' first title win since her
victory at the Italian Open in May.

<HEADLINE> McRae Leads First Leg of British Rally </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 22 (Xinhua) -- Scot driver Colin McRae took
command of the first leg of British Rally on Sunday after world
champion Tommi Makinen crashed out in controversial circumstances
after six stages.
</P>
<P>
The Finn's spin and collision, after hitting oil dumped on the
road by a historic rally car that had gone through the same
Millbrook stage an hour earlier, resulted in him smashing into a
concrete block -- and possibly out of the world title race.
</P>
<P>
The smash ripped Makinen's right rear tyre off his Mitusbishi
and almost certainly wrecked his hopes of a record third
successive crown.
</P>
<P>
Spaniard Carlos Sainz, his only rival, now needs only to
finish in the top four in his Toyota and avoid any problems to
win the championship for a third time. After the opening day he
was second, 3.6 seconds behind McRae.
</P>
<P>
McRae, driving a Subaru, built up a formidable lead of more
than 23 seconds on the first eight short spectator stages which
dominated the day before suffering a puncture on a high-speed
super-special stage at the Silverstone racing circuit.
</P>
<P>
He survived that, but saw his lead cut to just 0.4 of a
second, before clawing back his advantage at the end of the
opening leg.
</P>
<P>
Sainz drove a measured pace throughout the day and finished
behind McRae who is determined to register a fourth win in five
years on his home event before leaving Subaru for Ford next year.
</P>
<P>
Makinen was livid at his unscheduled early exit from a rally
which has always brought him bad luck. He blamed the organisers
for failing to warn the drivers of the hazardous oil, dropped by
a 31-year-old Hillman Imp.
</P>
<P>
"It happened on the first left-hand bend," said Makinen.
"There was black stuff on the surface and it just threw me
completely. Yes, I am very upset. I have thrown the championship
away."
</P>
<P>
Makinen crashed, losing a wheel, on the fifth stage but
continued with only three wheels on his car in the sixth stage,
also at Millbrook, a road car testing facility, before retiring.
</P>
<P>
He attempted to drive to the next section at Silverstone, but
was stopped by a police motorcyclist. This brought his rally to
an end.
</P>
<P>
Makinen had made a mediocre start anyway and was left trailing
by McRae who reeled off six successive fastest stage times -- he
shared top spot with his younger brother and Subaru teammate
Alister on the opening stage -- before Sainz was quickest on the
seventh stage at Silverstone.
</P>
<P>
McRae recovered to head the times again on the eighth and 11th
stages -- Frenchman Didier Auriol in a Toyota was best on nine
and 10 -- before brother Alister was first on 12.
</P>
<P>
Briton Richard Burns made a poor start in his Mitsubishi, but
was quickest in the final stage back at the rally's headquarters
at Cheltenham racecourse.
</P>
<P>
The four front-runners were separated by only 7.9 seconds
ahead of Monday's tests in the Welsh forests.

<HEADLINE> Low Cost Solution to High Auto Emissions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 22 (Xinhua) -- An engineering scientist
from Simon Fraser University developed an onboard diagnostic
system designed to turn on a warning light when car emissions
become too high, due to instrument failures, aging and other
factors, according to a Press Release issued by the university.
</P>
<P>
After three-year study in General Motors' Detroit lab, Mehrdad
Saif developed the model-based technology that would mean
upgrading existing software in new cars, rather than producing new
hardware at additional cost. using engine data from healthy and
faulty research cars at the Detroit lab, the technology uses
mathematical algorithms to detect and isolate engine faults.
</P>
<P>
"Cars already have on-board computerized engine control tasks,
and we are certain that for the most part, the same data can be
used for diagnostic monitoring, allowing us to do additional
things without introducing costly new hardware," said Saif.

disputing over the release of Palestinian prisoners,
U.S. officials stepped in Sunday and urged the two sides to
resolve the difference themselves.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Impeachment Issue Wouldn't Take a Lot of Debate, Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 22 (Xinhua) -- Representative Bob
Livingston said on Sunday if the Judiciary Committee reports
articles of impeachment of President Bill Clinton to the House of
Representatives, "I wouldn't imagine that it would take a lot of
debate."
</P>
<P>
Livingston told NBC's "Meet the Press" that the House could
vote after two or three hours of debate and "be done with it. If
we did not have the votes to sustain the charge, that would be
it."
</P>
<P>
Livingston becomes speaker when the 106th Congress convenes in
January, succeeding Newt Gingrich.
</P>
<P>
Livingston, while insisting that the constitutional process
must be followed, has said he wants the matter dealt with before
he takes office.
</P>
<P>
He said there would be "no hope" of that happening if more
evidence of presidential wrongdoing is introduced to the Judiciary
Committee. But if the evidence is all in, and the committee
decides to refer articles of impeachment to the House, the matter
should be ended this year, he said.
</P>
<P>
A majority vote in the House would send articles of impeachment
to the Senate. That body would need a two-thirds vote to remove
Clinton from office.
</P>
<P>
With 15 to 20 House Republicans reportedly opposed to
impeachment, the issue could die on the House floor. Asked whether
impeachment would ever go to the Senate, Representative Lindsey
Graham, a Republican member of the Judiciary Committee, said
Sunday: "Right now, with the political landscape, I would say no."
</P>
<P>
Graham, who has questioned whether the president's offenses are
impeachable, wrote Clinton lawyer David Kendall and asked him
Saturday to provide evidence that would exonerate the president.
Such information, he said, was crucial to his "making a fair and
responsible judgment," The Associated Press reported.
</P>
<P>
Representative Martin Meehan, a Democrat, appearing with Graham
on ABC's "This Week," urged Livingston, as the incoming House
leader, to negotiate language censuring the president for lying
about his affair with Monica Lewinsky. If not, "Republicans will
have no one to blame but themselves if the president gets off
without anything at all."
</P>
<P>
Livingston said censure "would certainly be a possibility" but
that such a step would better be left for after the House votes on
impeachment.
</P>
<P>
White House adviser Paul Begala, on CBS' "Face the Nation,"
said it was "very, very important for the American people to
understand that there's not some sort of negotiation or deal going
on."
</P>
<P>
White House special counsel Greg Craig, on NBC and CNN's "Late
Edition," agreed that no official talks were under way but said
the president would accept punishment outside of impeachment. "He
is open to any kind of reasonable and serious proposal that has
some prospect of bringing this to a just and rapid conclusion,"
Craig said.
</P>
<P>
Craig said the White House would respond this week to a list
submitted by the Judiciary Committee of 81 questions about the
Lewinsky affair. He said Clinton and his lawyers will meet to
complete the response Tuesday, after he returns from a trip to
Asia.
</P>
<P>
Livingston agreed that politics will play a part in decisions
on the fate of allegations against Clinton.
</P>
<P>
"If it is shown that the president of the United States is
guilty of perjury, we have a major problem," Livingston said.
"What to do about it is a political problem and should be weighed
again by each member when it is presented to him."
