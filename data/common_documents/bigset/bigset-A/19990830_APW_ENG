<HEADLINE> New York Jets Waive Seven Players </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HEMPSTEAD, N.Y. (AP) -- Defensive end Mike Frederick, a four-year  
veteran signed as a free agent, was one of seven players waived by 
the New York Jets on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Jets still need to make one more cut to get down to the  
league-mandated 65-player limit by Tuesday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	Frederick spent his entire NFL career with the  
Cleveland-Baltimore franchise. A third-round pick in 1995 by the 
Browns, he moved with the team to Baltimore in 1996 and started 11 
games for the Ravens. 
</P>
<P>
	Also released was second-year guard Doug Karczewski, who was  
projected as a starter entering training camp. But the rapid 
development of three rookies left no room for him. 
</P>
<P>
	The other cuts were sixth-round pick Mark Megna, a linebacker;  
receivers Brian Musso and Joe Douglass; cornerback Del Lee, and 
fullback-tight end Jermaine Wiggins, both rookies.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Team Tours Ryder Cup Course  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BROOKLINE, Mass. (AP) -- For some members of the U.S. Ryder Cup  
team, Monday was their first chance to play The Country Club, the 
venerable birthplace of American golf. For others, the memories 
already flow freely. 
</P>
<P>
	Whatever their history with the course has been, though, it's  
about to change. 
</P>
<P>
	``They know that they need to make history, too,'' captain Ben  
Crenshaw said after eight of the 12 U.S. team members played a 
practice round in preparation for their match Sept. 24-26 against 
the Europeans. 
</P>
<P>
	``The first-timers, when they get here, they'll understand what  
kind of place this is,'' Crenshaw said. ``I wanted them to 
experience that in a sort of a quiet situation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Country Club has played host to the U.S. Open three times,  
but none as memorable as the first in 1913, when a 20-year-old 
caddie named Francis Ouimet beat Englishmen Harry Vardon and Ted 
Ray in a playoff to win the title and establish himself as the 
father of American golf. 
</P>
<P>
	The Open was played here again in 1963, when it was won by  
Julius Boros, and in '88, when Curtis Strange won it. 
</P>
<P>
	``The place is dripping with history,'' said Hal Sutton, who  
finished 64th in the '88 U.S. Open and will return for the Ryder 
Cup. ``I'm just glad to be a part of this next bit of history.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sutton joined Ryder Cup teammates Phil Mickelson and The Country  
Club first-timers David Duval and Jeff Maggert in Monday's first 
foursome. Steve Pate, Payne Stewart and first-timers Jim Furyk and 
Justin Leonard played in the second group. 
</P>
<P>
	Davis Love III, who has a problem with a nerve in his neck, was  
seeing Dr. Frank Jobe in Alabama on Monday and could not play. 
Tiger Woods, Tom Lehman and Mark O'Meara were out with prior 
commitments. 
</P>
<P>
	Crenshaw first came to Brookline as a 16-year-old amateur and  
also played in the '88 U.S. Open, where he finished 12th. Since 
being named captain two years ago, he has gushed about the course's 
history and the way it challenges every aspect of a player's game. 
</P>
<P>
	``My feelings are so tied to this course. I wanted the fellas to  
come in and really enjoy the day -- of course for a practice round, 
but also for the setting,'' he said. ``You really do feel like 
you're playing against ... a piece of art.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After watching the favored Americans fall apart in 1997 in  
Valderrama -- their second consecutive loss -- Crenshaw stressed 
teamwork and camaraderie as a key to taking back the trophy. His 
goal for Monday's practice round was not just to familiarize the 
players with the course, but also with each other. 
</P>
<P>
	``Any moment we can spend with one another is golden, in my  
mind,'' said the captain, who told his players: ``When you go to a 
tournament, I want you to be together ... call one another. I want 
you to know what one another's thinking.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, camaraderie can only go so far.  
</P>
<P>
	``As much as you want to talk about a team, when Phil's out  
there putting, he has to make that putt,'' Duval said. ``We can't 
help him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pate agreed.  
</P>
<P>
	``Making putts is better than chemistry,'' he said. ``I don't  
know what you can do. It seems to me it's either there or it's not. 
We'll find out in three weeks.''

<HEADLINE>  Dennis Brings Rain to Carolina Coast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTIC BEACH, N.C. (AP) -- The punch-packing heart of Hurricane  
Dennis continued to track parallel to the North Carolina coast 
today, while its edge brought pelting rain, strong winds and the 
threat of beachfront flooding. 
</P>
<P>
	Forecasters expected the storm to turn northeast away from land,  
but the possibility of a full-force landfall in North Carolina 
remained. Even if Dennis' eye remains offshore, they said, the 
storm's strong winds could cause problems for coastal residents. 
</P>
<P>
	``(Dennis) has a very large eye, and the highest winds are well  
removed from the center,'' Todd Kimberlain, a meteorologist with 
the National Hurricane Center in Miami, said today. ``So even if 
the center stays offshore, there's a good chance in the warned area 
that they're going to experience hurricane conditions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A hurricane warning was in effect for much of the North Carolina  
coast, and a smattering of residents sought refuge in shelters in 
several coastal counties. The barrier islands along the Outer Banks 
were under an evacuation order. 
</P>
<P>
	At 5 a.m., Dennis was centered about 100 miles south-southwest  
of Cape Lookout and was moving north-northeast at about 12 mph. 
Maximum sustained winds were near 100 mph. Areas along the Cape 
Fear coast reported gusts of up to 80 mph early today. 
</P>
<P>
	A tropical storm warning was in effect from North Carolina to  
Maryland while a gale warning was in effect from Chincoteague, Va., 
to Cape Henlopen, Del. 
</P>
<P>
	A flood watch remained in the North Carolina coastal counties of  
Brunswick and New Hanover where up to 10 inches of rain was 
expected by morning. Isolated tornadoes also were possible today. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 30,000 customers were without power today from New  
Hanover County to as far west as Raleigh in the central part of the 
state, said Sally Ramey, a spokeswoman for Carolina Power and Light 
Co. The outage was expected to grow, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Roughly 100 evacuees -- fewer than expected -- sought refuge  
Sunday night at a Red Cross shelter at a Wilmington middle school. 
``It's just been a trickle,'' said shelter manager Judy Saunders. 
</P>
<P>
	On Sunday afternoon, Gov. Jim Hunt issued emergency and disaster  
decrees, allowing more resources to be devoted to the storm. 
Seymour Johnson Air Force Base sent aircraft to bases in Ohio as a 
precaution. 
</P>
<P>
	In Atlantic Beach on Sunday, residents took the storm in stride.  
Few houses were boarded, including those directly on the coast. 
Fire officials combed the beachfront in all-terrain vehicles, 
chasing away those who ignored posted warnings. 
</P>
<P>
	Just offshore, lone surfer Joey Gray rose and fell on surging  
tides. ``I think he's nuts,'' said Lt. Phil Lawrence of the city's 
fire department as he waited for Gray to come ashore. 
</P>
<P>
	Once on land, Gray was unfazed. ``I know it has a certain amount  
of risk,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Others didn't tempt fate. At Ziggy's by the Sea, a boardwalk  
club, the yells of beach volleyball fans had been replaced by the 
sounds of hammers and electric screwdrivers, as owner Spencer 
Stephens closed down. 
</P>
<P>
	Francis Vincent of Fenton, Mich. had planned to spend a few days  
in a rustic cabin on the nearby island of Camp Lookout. With a gas 
grill, jugs of water and even an inflatable dinghy, he was 
well-prepared for the storm, though he planned to ride it out in a 
mainland hotel. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're set for no power,'' he joked. ``It can't be no worse  
than a tornado.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In South Carolina, Dennis had become more a nuisance than a  
threat as rain fell on tourists slowly fleeing the coast in 
bumper-to-bumper traffic. The storm spun about 100 miles south of 
Myrtle Beach, bringing needed rain in a season of drought. 
</P>
<P>
	Further south, Georgia disaster officials felt relief for the  
first time in days as Dennis' northerly push assured the state it 
was free from its wrath. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're starting to uncross our fingers very slowly,'' said  
Phillip Webber, director of the Emergency Management Agency in 
coastal Chatham County. 
</P>
<P>
	In Florida, where a two-day brush with Dennis' outer edge  
brought downpours and wind gusts but no serious damage, surfers 
frolicked in the rolling sea on Sunday as cruise ships returned 
after fleeing when the possibility of disaster lurked. 
</P>
<P>
	At the Portside Galley Restaurant in Port Canaveral, Fla.,  
Christine DeSouza welcomed breakfast patrons with a new sign. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hello customers, bye bye Dennis,'' it read.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Aides Have Few Legal Bills </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- In an oddity for the Clinton presidency, top  
White House aides were largely untroubled last year by a 
long-standing hazard of working for Bill Clinton: fat legal bills. 
</P>
<P>
	Only one of 12 aides reported debts to law firms in 1998,  
according to financial disclosure forms released Monday. The 
exception is Bruce Lindsey, a close Clinton confidante who has 
served since January 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	Lindsey reported legal bills of between $600,000 and $1.25  
million, owed to two Washington law firms. He said he owes between 
$500,001-$1 million to Hogan &AMP; Hartson, incurred from 1994 to 1996, 
and $100,001-$250,000 to Murphy &AMP; Shaffer, incurred in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Lindsey was a target in a Whitewater investigation of two  
Arkansas bankers but was not indicted. 
</P>
<P>
	As for Clinton, his legal defense fund reported this month that  
it has paid $4.5 million in legal fees for both the president and 
first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton. The Clintons owe legal bills of 
about $10 million. 
</P>
<P>
	A few White House staffers, such as presidential secretary Betty  
Currie, still carry legal bills as a result of subpoenas in the 
Monica Lewinsky matter. But most who accrued such debts due to 
investigations -- such as George Stephanopoulos and Maggie Williams, 
the first lady's former chief of staff -- departed long ago. 
</P>
<P>
	This year, home mortgages are listed as the main liabilities for  
aides such as Chief of Staff John Podesta, political director 
Minyon Moore, deputy White House counsel Cheryl Mills and the first 
lady's spokeswoman, Marsha Berry. 
</P>
<P>
	They reported assets mainly comprising stock holdings, trusts,  
bonds or bank accounts. 
</P>
<P>
	Lindsey reported 1998 assets ranging from $541,000 to $2.11  
million and sold stocks valued up to $22,000. National security 
adviser Sandy Berger reported assets in a range between $1.16 
million and $2.89 million, while the first lady's chief of staff, 
Melanne Verveer, reported assets in a range between $1.52 million 
to $4.09 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The president's economic policy adviser, Gene Sperling, reported  
assets ranging between $1,000 and $50,000, and listed no 
liabilities.

<HEADLINE> Tribal Membership Disputes Heat Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MOUNT PLEASANT, Mich. (AP) -- For 20 years, Wallace Chatfield has  
periodically brought a bulging collection of birth certificates and 
census counts to the headquarters of the Saginaw Chippewas, hoping 
to join the tribe he already feels a part of by blood. 
</P>
<P>
	While other family members, including his parents, are  
recognized Chippewas, he says shifting birthplace rules have long 
been cited in keeping him off tribal rolls. 
</P>
<P>
	The distinction means Chatfield can't share in tribal benefits,  
which last year included $30,000 to each member from the Chippewas' 
highly successful Soaring Eagle Casino and Resort. 
</P>
<P>
	``They are trying to keep the number of membership as low as  
possible,'' said Chatfield, 52, who lives on the tribe's 
reservation. ``They aren't going to let me become a member because 
that's one less dollar they are going to receive.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In tribes across the nation, experts say similar disputes are  
brewing, especially in those with casino riches to share. 
</P>
<P>
	``Where there is a big pie to fight around, that's where you  
tend to find these kinds of issues,'' said Robert Williams Jr., a 
professor of law and American Indian studies at the University of 
Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
	In August, differing membership philosophies among the 2,500  
Saginaw Chippewas boiled into a dispute that led to standoffs with 
police, federal intervention and lawsuits over tribal control. 
</P>
<P>
	Tribal spokesman Ronald Jackson, who said he isn't familiar with  
Chatfield's case, said new Chippewas won't be designated until 
after fall tribal elections triggered by the membership debate. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's the problem of sudden wealth, and that raises all  
sorts of issues about your identity,'' said Jeff Corntassel, a 
member of the Oklahoma Cherokee tribe and Virginia Tech law 
professor. 
</P>
<P>
	``It can pit tribal members against each other. It's sort of  
like a divide-and-conquer strategy of colonial times that has been 
detrimental to Indians,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Tribal membership not only entitles Indians to benefits such as  
education and health care, but citizenship in an Indian nation, 
voting rights and other cultural entitlements. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are people who have some sincere beliefs that tribal  
membership defines who you are,'' Williams said. ``It should be no 
surprise that people get upset with this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The constitutions of most tribes require a certain blood quantum  
-- or proportion of Indian lineage -- for membership. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this year, the Tigua Indian tribe near El Paso, Texas,  
banished about 10 families from the reservation after they couldn't 
prove a one-eighth blood quantum requirement. An effort to confirm 
Tigua membership began just before the tribe distributed the first 
payments from its Speaking Rock casino in December 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	And in July, members of the Confederated Tribes of the Grande  
Ronde, which operates the 4-year-old Spirit Mountain Casino west of 
Portland, Ore., voted to tighten membership requirements after a 40 
percent increase in membership followed the casino's opening. 
</P>
<P>
	The tribe amended its constitution to require that a member's  
one-sixteenth blood quantum must come from Grand Ronde tribes. 
Before, a quantum from a combination of any federally recognized 
tribes was accepted. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think you should be a member of a tribe because of your ties  
to it, not because of what it can provide for you,'' said Tracy 
Dugan, director of the tribe's public information office. 
</P>
<P>
	Robert Clinton, a judge for the Winnebago tribe of Nebraska and  
the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe in South Dakota, said the quantums 
are a bureaucratic legacy of colonialism, not an indigenous Indian 
policy. 
</P>
<P>
	Further, he said, the federally-prepared blood quantum test  
records are ``notoriously inaccurate because of language problems, 
inaccurate reporting and a misunderstanding of Indian kinship.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And Corntassel, who calls the quantums ``silly,'' asks: ``Is  
someone who has a one-eighth quantum more Indian than someone who 
is 1/64th?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Corntassel said tribes historically skirted rules by allowing  
for ``adoption'' of those who didn't qualify under membership 
standards. But the move is increasingly rare, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Andrew Lee, an Indian government expert at Harvard's John F.  
Kennedy School of Government, said it remains important for tribes 
to continue to set their own standards for membership, despite 
disputes. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is what sovereignty is all about,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Tokyo Stock Prices Rise Sharply / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- The expected launch of big local investment trusts  
sent Japanese stock prices sharply higher today. The dollar fell 
against the yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average rose 319.60 points,  
or 1.82 percent, to rebound from a four-day slump and close the day 
at 17,918.97. On Friday, the average closed down 66.92 points, or 
0.38 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 111.04 yen, down 0.40 yen from late Friday in  
Tokyo and also below its late New York level of 111.56 yen on 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	On the stock market, prices opened higher on buying by foreign  
investors. Domestic investors later joined in the buying spree, 
which came after the Nikkei average had fallen a total of 634.18 
points in the previous four trading days. 
</P>
<P>
	Short-term players bought actively, expecting that major local  
investment trusts will start buying Tuesday to set up funds 
totaling an estimated $541 million. 
</P>
<P>
	But some investors were taking a cautious approach, concerned  
about the impact of the yen's strength on the Japanese economy, 
traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	A strong yen makes Japanese goods more expensive overseas,  
hurting Japanese exporters. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section was up 19.56 points, or 1.32 percent, to 1,497.94. 
The TOPIX closed down 2.70 points, or 0.18 percent, on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Volume on the First Section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange was  
estimated at 455.43 million shares, down from 487.04 million shares 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Advancing issues outnumbered retreaters 693 to 492 on the First  
Section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange, while 120 issues were 
unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency dealings, the dollar slid on selling by U.S. funds  
that let go of the currency in the belief that U.S. Federal Reserve 
Chairman Alan Greenspan seemed concerned about stock values. 
</P>
<P>
	In a speech at a Federal Reserve meeting on Friday, Greenspan  
said the extraordinary rise in U.S. stock prices over the last five 
years has been mostly inexplicable. Those remarks pushed the Dow 
Jones industrial average down. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow closed down 108.28 points, or 1 percent, to close at  
11,090.17 on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Market players were also watching the outcome of a meeting of  
deputy finance ministers of the Group of Seven industrialized 
countries, scheduled for today and Tuesday in Berlin. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar ranged between 110.75 yen and 111.21 yen in today's  
trading. 
</P>
<P>
	In other currencies, the euro was traded at 116.09 yen, down  
from 116.38 yen late Friday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on the benchmark No. 214 10-year Japanese government  
bond rose to 1.9800 percent from Friday's finish of 1.9400 percent, 
driving its price down to 99.33 yen from 99.66 yen.

<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Interest rates on short-term Treasury  
securities rose in Monday's auction. 
</P>

	The Treasury Department sold $7.5 billion in three-month bills  
at a discount rate of 4.875 percent, up from 4.850 percent last 
week. An additional $7.5 billion in six-month bills was sold at a 
rate of 4.990 percent, up from 4.950 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The three-month rate was the highest since Aug. 24, 1998, when  
the bills sold for 4.920 percent. The six-month rate was the 
highest since Aug. 3, 1998, when the rate was 5.030. 
</P>
<P>
	The new discount rates understate the actual return to investors  
-- 5.017 percent for three-month bills with a $10,000 bill selling 
for $9,876.80 and 5.205 percent for a six-month bill selling for 
$9,747.70.

<HEADLINE>  Islands Evacuated As Dennis Nears </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WRIGHTSVILLE BEACH, N.C. (AP) -- Hurricane Dennis headed closer  
to North Carolina's beaches Sunday night, paralleling the coast in 
a path expected to keep the brunt of the storm away from land. 
</P>
<P>
	The hurricane prompted evacuation orders for the Outer Banks and  
other barrier islands further south as conditions were expected to 
worsen overnight. 
</P>
<P>
	By 1 a.m. EDT, Dennis was 100 miles south of Wilmington, with  
its top wind at 105 mph, and it had edged slightly toward the east. 
A hurricane warning was posted for much of the coast of North 
Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
	Winds were gusting up to 70 mph along the southern coast of the  
state and rain pelted some areas, the National Weather Service said 
at midnight. Brunswick and New Hanover counties had received 1.5 
inches of rain and were under a flood watch as forecasters expected 
up to 8 inches total throughout the night. 
</P>
<P>
	Dennis was moving north-northeast at 14 mph and expected to take  
a gradual turn to the northeast on Monday. The storm's track was 
far from certain, but the National Hurricane Center said it did not 
think the storm would cross the coast. 
</P>
<P>
	``It weaves and bobs as it goes along,'' said Jerry Jarrell, the  
center's director. 
</P>
<P>
	He also cautioned that because of the hurricane's size, with  
tropical storm-force wind extending 200 miles from the center on 
Sunday, ``it doesn't have to come across the coastline to cause 
pretty strong winds.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Forecasters said winds approaching hurricane force could pass  
off the coast of Cape Fear near North Carolina's southernmost tip 
at sunrise Monday. Hurricane force winds were expected to remain 
offshore. 
</P>
<P>
	Shelters remained emptier than in previous seasons, as many  
residents decided to board up their homes and wait out the storm. 
Trask Middle School, an acting Red Cross shelter in Wilmington, 
held 95 evacuees at 11:30 p.m. Sunday, said Judy Saunders, shelter 
manager. ``It's just been a trickle,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	In South Carolina, officials closed 13 shelters around  
Charleston after just 40 people showed up. 
</P>
<P>
	In Myrtle Beach, S.C., Johnny and Kim Sizemore went bowling  
Sunday night as the fringe of the storm dumped heavy rain on the 
area. They joked about the 4 feet of water that filled their home 
when Hurricane Hugo slammed into the area 10 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Given that, Sunday night's rain -- more than a half-inch fell at  
North Myrtle Beach during the first couple of hours -- was not a 
concern, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't worry. I've got too much to lose,'' said Sizemore, 36,  
who rents a couple houses in the area. 
</P>
<P>
	Well in advance of the storm, North Carolina Gov. Jim Hunt  
declared a state of emergency and a state of disaster, which 
allowed him to activate any resources necessary to cope with the 
storm. 
</P>
<P>
	Wrightsville Beach declared an 8 p.m. curfew Sunday, and Seymour  
Johnson Air Force Base sent aircraft to bases in Ohio to escape the 
storm. New Hanover County at Wilmington said schools, courts and 
offices would be closed Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The storm kicked up high waves during the day for surfers on the  
Outer Banks. 
</P>
<P>
	``Today was really, really big,'' Brian Schwartz said after  
surfing before going to work at Bert's Surf Shop on Nags Head. 
``You had to be a little cautious, but we had a lot of fun rides.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A hurricane warning was in effect from Little River Inlet, S.C.,  
on the North Carolina-South Carolina line to Oregon Inlet, N.C. A 
hurricane watch and a tropical storm warning were in effect from 
Edisto Beach to Little River Inlet, S.C. 
</P>
<P>
	Along North Carolina's sandy, low-lying Outer Banks chain of  
barrier islands, evacuations started at 1 p.m. south of Oregon 
Inlet and at noon on Ocracoke Island. 
</P>
<P>
	There weren't many people on the island, said Terry Gray at the  
Hatteras Island ferry office. ``We haven't been haulin' a whole 
lot,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Red flags were posted along Wrightsville Beach, warning swimmers  
of possible rip currents. Last year, a 10-year-old swimmer at 
Atlantic Beach drowned in a rip current before Hurricane Bonnie 
arrived. 
</P>
<P>
	Out of the water, the approaching storm hadn't slowed business  
yet for Kitty Hawk Kites, which operates hang-gliding classes on 
the huge Jockey's Ridge sand dune on the Outer Banks, about 50 
miles north of Cape Hatteras. Melissa Lim said several people went 
hang gliding Sunday morning and classes were held during the day. 
</P>
<P>
	Dennis blew through the northern Bahamas on Saturday. Few homes  
were severely damaged, but several boats sank at marinas, said 
James Sweeting, assistant manager of the Divers Down dive shop on 
Treasure Cay. 
</P>
<P>
	Silt stirred up by the storm will likely kill parts of the coral  
reefs that draw divers to the islands, he said. ``It'll grow back, 
but it's not going to look as pretty for a couple of months,'' said 
Sweeting.

<HEADLINE>  Dennis Brings Rain to Carolina Coast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTIC BEACH, N.C. (AP) -- The punch-packing heart of Hurricane  
Dennis continued to track parallel to the North Carolina coast 
today, while its edge brought pelting rain, strong winds and the 
threat of beachfront flooding. 
</P>
<P>
	Forecasters expected the storm to turn northeast away from land,  
but the possibility of a full-force landfall in North Carolina 
remained. Even if Dennis' eye remains offshore, they said, the 
storm's strong winds could cause problems for coastal residents. 
</P>
<P>
	``(Dennis) has a very large eye, and the highest winds are well  
removed from the center,'' Todd Kimberlain, a meteorologist with 
the National Hurricane Center in Miami, said today. ``So even if 
the center stays offshore, there's a good chance in the warned area 
that they're going to experience hurricane conditions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A hurricane warning was in effect for much of the North Carolina  
coast, and a smattering of residents sought refuge in shelters in 
several coastal counties. The barrier islands along the Outer Banks 
were under an evacuation order. 
</P>
<P>
	At 5 a.m., Dennis was centered about 100 miles south-southwest  
of Cape Lookout and was moving north-northeast at about 12 mph. 
Maximum sustained winds were near 100 mph. Areas along the Cape 
Fear coast reported gusts of up to 80 mph early today. 
</P>
<P>
	A tropical storm warning was in effect from North Carolina to  
Maryland while a gale warning was in effect from Chincoteague, Va., 
to Cape Henlopen, Del. 
</P>
<P>
	A flood watch remained in the North Carolina coastal counties of  
Brunswick and New Hanover where up to 10 inches of rain was 
expected by morning. Isolated tornadoes also were possible today. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 30,000 customers were without power today from New  
Hanover County to as far west as Raleigh in the central part of the 
state, said Sally Ramey, a spokeswoman for Carolina Power and Light 
Co. The outage was expected to grow, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Roughly 100 evacuees -- fewer than expected -- sought refuge  
Sunday night at a Red Cross shelter at a Wilmington middle school. 
``It's just been a trickle,'' said shelter manager Judy Saunders. 
</P>
<P>
	On Sunday afternoon, Gov. Jim Hunt issued emergency and disaster  
decrees, allowing more resources to be devoted to the storm. 
Seymour Johnson Air Force Base sent aircraft to bases in Ohio as a 
precaution. 
</P>
<P>
	In Atlantic Beach on Sunday, residents took the storm in stride.  
Few houses were boarded, including those directly on the coast. 
Fire officials combed the beachfront in all-terrain vehicles, 
chasing away those who ignored posted warnings. 
</P>
<P>
	Just offshore, lone surfer Joey Gray rose and fell on surging  
tides. ``I think he's nuts,'' said Lt. Phil Lawrence of the city's 
fire department as he waited for Gray to come ashore. 
</P>
<P>
	Once on land, Gray was unfazed. ``I know it has a certain amount  
of risk,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Others didn't tempt fate. At Ziggy's by the Sea, a boardwalk  
club, the yells of beach volleyball fans had been replaced by the 
sounds of hammers and electric screwdrivers, as owner Spencer 
Stephens closed down. 
</P>
<P>
	Francis Vincent of Fenton, Mich. had planned to spend a few days  
in a rustic cabin on the nearby island of Camp Lookout. With a gas 
grill, jugs of water and even an inflatable dinghy, he was 
well-prepared for the storm, though he planned to ride it out in a 
mainland hotel. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're set for no power,'' he joked. ``It can't be no worse  
than a tornado.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In South Carolina, Dennis had become more a nuisance than a  
threat as rain fell on tourists slowly fleeing the coast in 
bumper-to-bumper traffic. The storm spun about 100 miles south of 
Myrtle Beach, bringing needed rain in a season of drought. 
</P>
<P>
	Further south, Georgia disaster officials felt relief for the  
first time in days as Dennis' northerly push assured the state it 
was free from its wrath. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're starting to uncross our fingers very slowly,'' said  
Phillip Webber, director of the Emergency Management Agency in 
coastal Chatham County. 
</P>
<P>
	In Florida, where a two-day brush with Dennis' outer edge  
brought downpours and wind gusts but no serious damage, surfers 
frolicked in the rolling sea on Sunday as cruise ships returned 
after fleeing when the possibility of disaster lurked. 
</P>
<P>
	At the Portside Galley Restaurant in Port Canaveral, Fla.,  
Christine DeSouza welcomed breakfast patrons with a new sign. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hello customers, bye bye Dennis,'' it read.

<HEADLINE> Calif. Hotel Bringing Back Beatles </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PALO ALTO, Calif. (AP) -- Back in 1965, the Beatles spent a night  
holed up at the top of the eight-story Cabana Hotel. 
</P>
<P>
	After two sold-out shows in nearby Daly City, the mop-topped  
British rockers deserved the rest. Outside, hundreds of fans, most 
of them girls in various stages of swoon, gathered to scream to 
their idols high above. 
</P>
<P>
	The band left the hotel in a delivery truck. The sheets they  
slept on were cut up and sold. The room service dishes and cutlery 
disappeared. 
</P>
<P>
	Now the hotel, newly renovated after closing in 1992, is  
bringing back the Beatles. The Crowne Plaza Cabana Palo Alto 
officially opened the Beatles Room, No. 810, Saturday night. 
Reproductions of Beatles memorabilia are on display in the room. 
</P>
<P>
	David Young, the Crowne Plaza's sales director, says he has been  
surprised by the lasting impression the Beatles' short stay made. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was at a Hewlett-Packard golf tournament recently, and  
everybody who was in a certain age group came by and said they had 
tried to dress up like the press with a suit and camera to try to 
sneak in to the Beatles,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Tex. Beauty Queen Accused of Threats </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LUBBOCK, Texas (AP) -- A teen-age beauty queen who failed to make  
the cheerleading squad withdrew from school and relinquished her 
crown after being accused of threatening the cheerleaders' lives. 
</P>
<P>
	Roni Lowe, Miss Lubbock Teen USA, allegedly declared in the  
lunch room: ``All of the cheerleaders will disappear from the face 
of the Earth and everyone will know who did it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A parent of one of the students complained. After an  
investigation, school officials concluded the 16-year-old made the 
alleged threat earlier this month. She was suspended and given 
three months at an alternative campus for students with behavior 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
	Miss Lowe instead withdrew from Frenship High School last week.  
</P>
<P>
	After a series of shootings in schools nationwide, few  
administrators are laughing off any threats. Texas cheerleading has 
its own history of murderous intentions, drawing headlines in 1991 
when a mother was convicted of trying to hire a hit man to kill her 
daughter's competitor for the squad. 
</P>
<P>
	Miss Lowe acknowledged mouthing off to one cheerleader but  
denied that she threatened the entire squad or threatened anything 
more serious than a fistfight. 
</P>
<P>
	``She had been saying that I said stuff that I hadn't and I told  
her I was going to kick her butt and everybody was going to know 
who did it,'' Miss Lowe said Monday. ``I use my mouth as my 
hands.'' 
</P>
<P>
	School official said that even a joke like that would violate  
the school's zero-tolerance policy on threats. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is unfortunate, but there isn't any room for joking anymore  
when it comes to threats,'' said Paul Whitton, Frenship's 
superintendent, citing several deadly school shootings such as the 
one in Littleton, Colo. 
</P>
<P>
	If proven, such threats would violate the pageant system's  
strict behavior policies and a moral code signed by all 
contestants, pageant officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	``To avoid any further publicity that could possibly bring harm  
to Miss Lubbock USA and Miss Lubbock Teen USA and myself, I 
relinquish the title and crown of my own free will,'' Miss Lowe 
said in a statement released by the pageant. 
</P>
<P>
	Monica Vasquez, a Frenship High junior, will serve Miss Lowe's  
term as Miss Lubbock Teen USA 1999 and will get her prizes, 
including a $500 college scholarship. Miss Vasquez will compete in 
November to be Miss Texas Teen USA. 
</P>
<P>
	Miss Lowe said she was punished so harshly because the  
principal's daughter is a cheerleader. Administrators refused to 
confirm or deny whether the daughter is on the squad. 
</P>
<P>
	At lunch hour on Monday, many students seemed to think Miss Lowe  
was treated too harshly. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think anyone thinks she really meant it,'' said  
16-year-old Russ Lopez. ``People say stuff like this all the time 
and don't get in trouble. It just happened to get back and now 
she's in all this trouble. It's kind of stupid.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But students also said that no one is ignoring the obvious  
lesson. 
</P>
<P>
	``You've got to watch what you say, even if it's just a joke,''  
said Amanda Thomas, 14. ``No one cares if you're kidding or not 
anymore.''

<HEADLINE> Martin Mulls Chinese for Next Album </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SINGAPORE (AP) -- Puerto Rican pop sensation Ricky Martin says he  
may sing Mandarin Chinese on his next album. 
</P>
<P>
	``Why not?'' Martin asked Monday. ``Or Japanese,'' said the  
singer best known for mixing Spanish and English in hits such as 
``Livin' La Vida Loca.'' 
</P>
<P>
	An Asian influence can be heard on his latest compact disc,  
titled ``Ricky Martin,'' he said while promoting the album in 
Singapore. 
</P>
<P>
	``I spent half the year in Asia last year, and at the same time  
I was recording my album,'' he said. ``I went back to the studio 
and told them how I was affected by these beautiful sounds.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Martin, once part of the teeny-bopper group Menudo, is wildly  
popular in Asia. Fans from as far away as Australia and India 
traveled to Singapore to watch the heartthrob sing five songs at a 
30-minute show Sunday.

<HEADLINE> Voucher Supporters Raise Funds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- Supporters of school vouchers have started a  
fund-raiser so first-year participants in the state's program can 
stay in private schools, despite a judge's ruling. 
</P>
<P>
	The School Choice Committee announced Monday it was trying to  
raise $2 million for Cleveland students who are new to the 
4-year-old program. The Ohio Roundtable, a public policy 
organization, donated $25,000 to the cause on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, U.S. District Judge Solomon Oliver Jr. altered his  
earlier ruling that halted the taxpayer-supported voucher program 
until he ruled on whether it violated the constitutional separation 
of church and state. 
</P>
<P>
	He decided that students who participated in the program last  
year could get the vouchers again this year. New students could 
not. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 4,000 students from kindergarten through sixth-grade  
have signed up to get up to $2,500 in tuition vouchers for private 
schools in Cleveland. Court records show that 587 students were 
expected to join this year, but the School Choice Committee placed 
that number at 817. 
</P>
<P>
	The state attorney general's office and other pro-voucher groups  
have appealed the suspension of the program to federal court.

<P>
	TORONTO (AP) -- Vernon Wells, the Toronto Blue Jays' top  
prospect, was called up to the major leagues Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Wells, 20, has quickly been promoted through the Blue Jays'  
organization this year. hitting .334 with 18 homers, 81 RBIs and 24 
steals with three farm team. 
</P>
<P>
	With Brian McRae hitting .175 and Jose Cruz Jr. in the minors,  
Toronto manager Jim Fregosi said Wells will play every day in 
center field. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've tried some guys there, and it just hasn't worked out,''  
Fregosi said. ``Wells hasn't missed a step wherever he's gone this 
year, so we'll see what we have.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wells was the fifth pick overall in the 1997 amateur draft.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm here to help, whether it's to bring guys a glass of water,  
or to get a hit at a crucial time,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Toronto released outfielder Geronimo Berroa and optioned third  
baseman Casey Blake to the minors. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Chris Carpenter, the Blue Jays most consistent  
starter this season, will miss his next start because of 
inflammation in his right elbow. Carpenter missed a few starts 
earlier this season because of it.

<HEADLINE> Handyman Reportedly Assaulted Teens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FRESNO, Calif. (AP) -- A motel handyman who admitted beheading a  
Yosemite naturalist also confessed to sexually assaulting two 
teen-age sightseers before they were killed, the government said in 
court documents filed Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Cary Stayner told the FBI he sexually assaulted Silvina Pelosso  
and Juli Sund in their room at the Cedar Lodge before killing them, 
according to a six-page affidavit to support a request for bodily 
fluid samples. A judge ordered Stayner to comply. 
</P>
<P>
	Stayner also led the FBI to the knives he says he used to  
decapitate Joie Armstrong and slash the throat of Juli Sund, the 
affidavit says. The weapons had dried blood and fingerprints on 
them. 
</P>
<P>
	The affidavit is the first public acknowledgment by  
investigators that the two teen-age victims were sexually assaulted 
before they and Ms. Sund's mother, Carole Sund, were killed. 
Stayner is the prime suspect but has not been charged in their 
deaths. 
</P>
<P>
	Stayner, 38, has been charged with murder in the July 21 death  
of Ms. Armstrong, a naturalist who led outdoor education programs 
at the park. In a jailhouse interview with a television reporter, 
he claimed he didn't sexually assault any of the women. 
</P>
<P>
	Stayner has fought a request to give samples of his blood, hair  
and saliva to the FBI. 
</P>
<P>
	Stayner lived and worked at the Cedar Lodge, the last place the  
three sightseers were seen alive in February. Analysis by the FBI 
crime lab has yielded trace evidence including ``hairs in vacuum 
sweepings'' and ``possible bodily fluid stains on a blanket seized 
in the room,'' the affidavit says. 
</P>
<P>
	The crime lab has also recovered two partial fingerprints from  
the anonymous letter that Stayner claims to have authored and 
mailed to the FBI's Modesto office in March, directing 
investigators to Juli Sund's body. 
</P>
<P>
	At Stayner's direction, investigators also seized the camouflage  
pants and black shorts he was wearing the night he says he killed 
the sightseers.

<HEADLINE> Disney To Close ESPN Stores </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BURBANK, Calif. (AP) -- The Walt Disney Co. will close its three  
ESPN stores and focus on restaurants and the Internet to sell 
merchandise for the cable TV sports network, the company said. 
</P>
<P>
	Disney executives decided they can sell more product through the  
ESPN Zone restaurant and entertainment centers, the ESPNstore.com 
Internet site and through non-Disney retail stores, said Tom Park, 
executive vice president of The Disney Store Worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
	Disney will close ESPN-The Store sites in Glendale, Santa Ana  
and Torrance on Oct. 1. About 40 employees will be affected, with 
some being transferred to other Disney operations, according to a 
news statement Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The change comes in the midst of a companywide restructuring  
designed to reverse a long slump in Disney's profits and stock 
price. Weak sales of Disney merchandise have been among the 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
	Disney operates two ESPN Zone centers in Baltimore and Chicago.  
The company plans to open additional outlets in Atlanta, Washington 
and New York City. 
</P>
<P>
	The company also plans to expand the ESPN.com Web site to  
include 15,000 new items, including golf and tennis equipment and 
footwear.

	KANSAS CITY, (AP) -- Offensive tackle John Tait, the 14th player  
taken in this year's NFL draft, is close to reaching terms with the 
Kansas City Chiefs, his agent told The Associated Press on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no way it's going to happen tonight,'' agent Ethan  
Locke said, ``but it's close to getting done. We still have a lot 
of things to address, but it's a lot closer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Chiefs made the 6-foot-6, 306-pound Brigham Young junior the  
first offensive lineman taken in the 1999 draft. But negotiations 
stalled at the outset and he did not make an offer to the Chiefs 
until the eve of the opening of training camp July 31. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, after missing the entire camp in River Falls, Wis.,  
Tait was quoted as saying he might even sit out the year and go 
back into the 2000 draft. But the Chiefs doubted that since Tait is 
24 years old after serving a two-year Mormon mission and is already 
nearing his peak earning years as an athlete. 
</P>
<P>
	Locke denied broadcast reports that Tait was on his way to  
Kansas City. 
</P>
<P>
	``Not yet,'' he said. ``But we are hopeful that John will be in  
Kansas City very soon.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tuesday is the first mandatory cut-down day for NFL teams.  
</P>
<P>
	A spokesman for the Chiefs said he had no knowledge that the  
club was near reaching terms with Tait. 
</P>
<P>
	The club was hopeful Tait could provide immediate help this year  
at left tackle and develop into the next John Alt, who was named to 
the Pro Bowl twice while manning left tackle from 1984-96. 
</P>
<P>
	Tait was on several All-America lists his junior year at Brigham  
Young. 
</P>
<P>
	He missed the 1994 and 1995 seasons while he was on a church  
mission to Tennessee.

<HEADLINE> CompUSA To Lay Off 1,800 in Sales </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- Personal computer and electronics retailer CompUSA  
is laying off about 1,800 people in a restructuring that will 
reduce its commercial sales force by half. 
</P>
<P>
	The company said that commercial sales representatives would be  
regionally based instead of working out of CompUSA stores, which 
led to duplication in markets where the chain has more than one 
store. The commercial sales organization will shrink from 3,600 to 
1,800, under the reorganization announced Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Spokeswoman Suzanne Shelton said 1,800 workers would be laid  
off. Of the remaining 1,800 sales employees, she said 1,300 have 
been offered positions elsewhere in the revamped operation, 
including in a new Dallas call center. 
</P>
<P>
	The call center will feature advanced telecommunications  
services in which sales agents will immediately be able to see the 
customer's account information. 
</P>
<P>
	The company said the change is designed to cut costs and provide  
specialized service for corporate, government and education 
customers.

<HEADLINE> Calif. Judge's Home Firebombed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) -- Two teens and an adult are accused of  
throwing a Molotov cocktail at the home of a judge in an 
anti-Semitic attack. 
</P>
<P>
	Two 17-year-old boys and a 19-year-old man were booked for  
investigation of committing a hate crime, terrorism and arson, 
police said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The suspects thought Santa Clara County Superior Court Judge  
Jack Komar is Jewish, although he is Catholic. Neither the judge 
nor his wife were injured. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's very, very clear that the hateful motive involved in this  
firebombing was because the suspects believed that the residents 
living in that particular house were Jewish,'' deputy police chief 
Donald Anders said. ``That was the primary motive.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Officers said one of the juvenile suspects called 911 after the  
firebomb was thrown early Monday morning in an attempt to blame 
someone else. But investigators soon tracked the crime back to him. 
</P>
<P>
	Racist literature, paintball pistols and pellet guns were  
confiscated from their homes as evidence. 
</P>
<P>
	The suspects live near the judge's home and are now the prime  
suspects in putting a swastika on his house last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Komar said he does not feel in danger, but declined to talk  
about the attack. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm just not going to rehash it or get into all the details  
about my personal feelings,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> 'Sixth Sense' Tops Box Office Again / Box Office  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The ghostly thriller ``The Sixth Sense''  
topped the box office again this weekend, joining the ``Star Wars'' 
prequel and ``Titanic'' as the only movies to take in more than $20 
million for four straight weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	Amid eight new releases, ``The Sixth Sense'' grossed $20.1  
million, giving it a total of $138.9 million in four weeks, 
according to industry estimates Sunday. The movie stars Bruce 
Willis as a therapist to a boy who talks to dead people. 
</P>
<P>
	Buena Vista managed to capture the two top spots at the weekend  
box office. The studio's action thriller ``13th Warrior,'' starring 
Antonio Banderas as a diplomat roped into battle in 10th century 
Europe, grossed $10.3 million in its debut. 
</P>
<P>
	The last studio to have the top two slots was 20th Century Fox  
with ``Titanic'' and the re-release of ``Grease'' in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	The box office coup came as no surprise to studio officials who  
delayed the opening of ``13th Warrior'' by two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	``It seemed like a fabulous time,'' said Chuck Viane, president  
of Buena Vista distribution. ``There was nothing competitive for 
our genre at all.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Viane, though, expected some tough competition next week with  
the debut of the action-filled ``Chill Factor,'' starring Cuba 
Gooding Jr. and Skeet Ulrich. 
</P>
<P>
	With so many movies debuting this weekend, it was tough for any  
one film to garner a strong following, said Paul Dergarabedian, 
president of Exhibitor Relations Co. Inc., which tracks movie 
ticket sales. 
</P>
<P>
	``They can't all do well,'' he said Sunday. ``The favorites are  
holding well enough so it is tough for the newcomers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The Muse,'' the highly publicized comedy starring Albert  
Brooks and Sharon Stone, opened with $4.2 million for seventh 
place. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Dergarabedian said ``The Muse'' is a movie for the  
older crowd who do not typically run to the box office on the 
opening weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	``In Too Deep,'' an action film starring Omar Epps and LL Cool  
J, placed eighth with $4.1 million, and ``The Astronaut's Wife,'' 
with Johnny Depp, was 10th with $4 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Blair Witch Project,'' meanwhile, slipped from No. 5 and  
tied for eighth place with $4.1 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The low-budget shocker has grossed $128 million, since it opened  
in wide release five weeks ago, making it one the most successful 
independent films in history. 
</P>
<P>
	Estimated grosses for Friday through Sunday at North American  
theaters, according to Exhibitor Relations Co. Inc. Final numbers 
were expected today. 
</P>
<P>
	1. ``The Sixth Sense,'' $20.1 million.  
</P>
<P>
	2. ``13th Warrior,'' $10.3 million.  
</P>
<P>
	3. ``Runaway Bride,'' $6.9 million.  
</P>
<P>
	4. ``Bowfinger,'' $6.6 million.  
</P>
<P>
	5. ``Mickey Blue Eyes,'' $5.4 million  
</P>
<P>
	6. ``The Thomas Crown Affair,'' $4.7 million.  
</P>
<P>
	7. ``The Muse,'' $4.2 million.  
</P>
<P>
	8. (tie) ``In Too Deep,'' $4.1 million.  
</P>
<P>
	8. (tie) ``The Blair Witch Project,'' $4.1 million.  
</P>
<P>
	10. ``The Astronaut's Wife,'' $4 million.

<HEADLINE> Freeman Is Different Away From 'ER' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Yvette Freeman can do more than fix a fast IV  
on ``ER.'' She can belt out a song, make a movie and, Hollywood's 
expectations of a black actress aside, envision a future with a 
sunny prognosis. 
</P>
<P>
	Freeman, who plays no-nonsense nurse Haleh Adams on NBC's  
popular medical drama, spent part of her off-duty summer months 
completing a recorded tribute to a woman she much admires, the late 
jazz singer Dinah Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	She practiced a new specialty as well after gaining entrance  
into an American Film Institute training program aimed at 
developing more women directors. 
</P>
<P>
	That Freeman is an accomplished singer may come as a surprise to  
``ER'' fans who have seen her only in scrubs. But she began her 
career on Broadway in the play ``Ain't Misbehavin''' and won a 1998 
Obie Award for ``Dinah Was,'' her off-Broadway musical based on 
Washington's life. 
</P>
<P>
	Her role as a filmmaker is one that seems a dream even to  
Freeman herself. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's fabulous. It's so hard to get into this (AFI) program,  
and I got in this year. I'm so stoked. I'm a little scared and 
happy,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	One of eight women accepted out of a large pool of applicants,  
Freeman was given training, a camera and a portion of the money 
needed for her film. She assembled a production crew and the rest 
of the funding. 
</P>
<P>
	She's so pleased with the result, ``The Blessing Way,'' that she  
plans to submit it to the Sundance Film Festival. The film stars 
Michele Lamar Richards (``The Bodyguard'') and Darryl Alan Reed 
(who appeared with ``Freeman'' in ``Dinah Was'' and ``The American 
President''). 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a piece I wrote about a black family and the two ways of  
dealing in this society, being Afrocentric or going the 'corporate 
way,' the American way,'' said Freeman, who takes the position that 
``these two need to blend.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think we should separate. I think we should include  
our culture and be part of this society. But you come away from the 
movie with the two sides of the issue, and pull from it what you 
want,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	If filmmaking is her new love, music remains an old friend. The  
daughter of jazz pianist Charles Freeman, Yvette Freeman made her 
name on stage with her rich, supple voice, able to handle blues and 
ballads with equal ease. 
</P>
<P>
	``A Tribute to Dinah Washington,'' her first recording, was  
produced by Freeman with her husband, jazz pianist and arranger 
Lanny Hartley. The pair work together at home -- in separate 
offices, Freeman notes -- in sweet harmony. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the songs they chose for the CD are ``Come Rain or Come  
Shine,'' ``A Bad Case of the Blues'' and ``My Foolish Heart.'' 
Missing is the popular Washington tune ``What a Diff'rence a Day 
Makes''; Freeman is saving that for a planned ``Dinah Was'' disc. 
</P>
<P>
	``Her songs are fabulous songs. They're songs with stories. And,  
since I'm an actress first, I sing the story. ... She tried to tell 
the story, and that's what I picked up on. It's the acting of the 
song, yet it's the emotion that's getting across in the music.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Freeman's admiration for Washington extends beyond her indelible  
talent. 
</P>
<P>
	``She was a businesswoman, had her own company and produced  
other singers. That was something unheard of in the '50s for a 
woman -- and she was a black woman,'' Freeman said. 
</P>
<P>
	Such career control is worth emulating. ``You can't just be an  
artist off in the corner somewhere. If you don't know about the 
business, it's not going to work.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The television industry's current disinterest in ethnic  
characters makes it even more vital for minority performers to take 
an active role in creating jobs for themselves and others, Freeman 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Critics have blasted the major broadcast networks for fielding a  
nearly all-white slate of new programs for the fall. The focus on 
young performers also is disturbing, said Freeman, who surveyed the 
new series' scripts and found only a single role she could play. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's horrible. This season is horrible. I think everybody just  
got a little mixed up because we were on our way to diversity. ... 
This country is pushing toward diversity, and I don't know what 
happened.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Whatever the reasons, Freeman said, she's confident the  
situation will change. And she intends to help force the issue. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know I have a place, I have something to do. And it's not  
only me: Every woman, every ethnic type, needs to come up with 
product for Hollywood. ... It's going to come from us. We've got to 
be ready to produce projects, give the powers that be ideas. 
</P>
<P>
	``And the powers that be have to remember about who's in this  
country. TV's gotta keep up.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere in television ....  
</P>
<P>
	BIG GAME: Turns out Animal Planet's most popular series is ``The  
Crocodile Hunter,'' featuring Steve and Terri Irwin. To satisfy 
fans, the channel has deemed this the official ``Crocodile Hunter 
Week,'' featuring new adventures with crocs and more. Among the 
episodes: tonight's ``Africa's Deadliest Snakes,'' in which Steve 
Irwin fulfills his dream of tracking some of the world's most 
remarkable snakes, and ``Wild River of Africa'' on Tuesday, which 
includes a trip down Zambia's Luangwa River. The series shows at 8 
p.m. EDT.

<HEADLINE> Dennis' Retreats From N.C. Coast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NAGS HEAD, N.C. (AP) -- People along the North Carolina coast  
breathed a sigh of relief Monday as Hurricane Dennis turned out to 
sea, sideswiping the shoreline with 112 mph gusts and a deluge that 
flooded streets and left tens of thousands without power. 
</P>
<P>
	The storm's center started peeling away from the coast after  
getting no closer than 60 miles. Two traffic deaths early Monday 
were blamed on the storm. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are hoping it continues that offshore track,'' said Jim  
Jones, spokesman for the state Division of Emergency Management. 
``If it stalls far enough away, that's fine, as long as it doesn't 
come back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Storm damage was light. New Hanover's losses totaled $217,000,  
while in Brunswick County, the collapse of a beachfront house at 
Ocean Isle Beach was the worst property damage reported, said Cecil 
Logan of the county emergency management office. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've seen a bunch of bad weather in this area, but we're real  
happy with how things turned out this time.'' said Bob Sheppard, an 
employee at Harbor Inn in Wrightsville Beach. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a dodged bullet,'' said Susan Rogers, who spent Sunday  
night on Wrightsville Beach. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, forecasters warned the danger wasn't over. Jerry Jarrell  
of the National Hurricane Center in Miami said experts believe 
Dennis will stall at sea Tuesday for three or four days. What it 
does after that is anyone's guess. 
</P>
<P>
	``Unfortunately, one of our better models is showing that it  
comes back into the coast, not far from where it is right now, 
close to Norfolk or in that general vicinity,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Over the weekend Dennis moved on a plodding course parallel to  
the coasts of the Carolinas. Tens of thousands of residents and 
tourists were evacuated from the barrier islands separated from the 
mainland by roads that get swamped in storms. The worst of the 
storm hit early Monday, churning up 30-foot seas. 
</P>
<P>
	Innkeeper Bob Touhey on Ocracoke Island, on North Carolina's  
Outer Banks, said: ``We have no power. Our water's off.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said a friend's wind gauge ``got stuck at 74 mph before it  
blew off the house.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At 11 p.m, Dennis was 145 miles east of Cape Hatteras, moving  
toward the east-northeast at 14 mph with maximum winds up to 90 
mph. The hurricane warning was downgraded to a tropical storm 
warning for most of the North Carolina coastline, from Cape Lookout 
to the Virginia border Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
	As it crept northward, powerful winds and downpours lashed the  
Wilmington area and other beaches on the southeastern coast of 
North Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
	For a time, it seemed yet another hurricane might cross Cape  
Fear, directly south of Wilmington, just like Bertha and Fran in 
1996 and Bonnie in 1998. Fran killed 25 people and caused up to $6 
billion in damage. 
</P>
<P>
	Shortly before noon, as Dennis approached the Outer Banks --  
which stick out from the Atlantic Seaboard like the sideview mirror 
on a car -- it began edging away from the coast. 
</P>
<P>
	Two people were killed in a head-on collision in the coastal  
community of Richlands as 60 mph gusts and 2 inches of rain blasted 
the area. In St. Augustine Beach, Fla., a 45-year-old surfer 
apparently drown in heavy waves caused by Dennis, officials said. 
The man's body was found early Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Southport, south of Wilmington, received 8 inches of rain.  
Sustained winds of 92 mph and gusts of 112 mph were reported at 
Frying Pan Shoals, south of Wilmington. 
</P>
<P>
	The storm knocked out power to more than 50,000 people as far  
inland as the Raleigh area. In southeast Virginia, 22,500 customers 
were without electricity. 
</P>
<P>
	On Hatteras Island, the ocean washed over N.C. 12, closing the  
only highway along the narrow barrier island. A stretch of the road 
was shut down near Kitty Hawk, too. 
</P>
<P>
	Bob and Mary Cantrell rode out the storm in their Wrightsville  
Beach cottage. He said he's not ready to become a mainlander. 
</P>
<P>
	``At the end of the day, we can take a walk on the beach and  
watch the sun set,'' he said. ``But each time one of these storms 
come, it eats away at my desire a little bit.''

<HEADLINE> Spirlea Upsets Seed at U.S. Open </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- There were no bumps and no bruises, and no  
confrontations. But Irina Spirlea got plenty of reminders of what 
happened two years ago at the U.S. Open. 
</P>
<P>
	It took, oh, perhaps a minute or so before it was noted that if  
form holds for the next week, Spirlea could meet old pal Venus 
Williams in the quarterfinals. 
</P>
<P>
	Spirlea rolled her eyes, thinking, here it comes again.  
</P>
<P>
	``Quarterfinals?'' she said after beating sixth-seeded Amanda  
Coetzer 6-1, 7-5 in the first round Monday. ``Slow down. I cannot 
think so far.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ever since she nailed Williams like a defensive tackle with a  
changeover bump in the semifinals in 1997 and punctuated the 
encounter with a stream of curses, the moment has defined Spirlea's 
career, especially at the Open. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is two years,'' she said, bristling just a little. ``It is  
so old.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, in the prim and proper world of tennis, it was a shocker,  
one that led Williams' father to call Spirlea, ``that big, tall, 
white turkey,'' further stirring things up. 
</P>
<P>
	The `turkey' has been chasing around the barnyard since, her  
game somewhat out of control since the bump at center court. She 
went from No. 8 in the world in 1997 to No. 15 last year to No. 20 
this season. More troubling has been her early-round bailouts. In 
11 tournaments this year, she's been past the second round just 
three times and not at all since the French Open. 
</P>
<P>
	So what's been wrong?  
</P>
<P>
	``In my game, nothing,'' she said. ``In my head, everything. My  
game has been pretty good. My head, not so good'' 
</P>
<P>
	That was evident against Coetzer, especially at the end of the  
match. 
</P>
<P>
	Spirlea was serving for the match when her game started falling  
apart all at once, buried in a sea of unforced errors and faults. 
She knew what was happening. She just couldn't do much about it. 
</P>
<P>
	``I said, `No, not again, don't do it again. Don't choke now.'  
It cannot be worse.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The pep talk didn't help. Spirlea dropped four straight points  
and the game. 
</P>
<P>
	The break at love gave Coetzer a chance to survive. But there  
wasn't much she could do about it, either. She was unable to get a 
point, broken right back, also at love. 
</P>
<P>
	It was a demonstration of the thin line between success and  
failure that these players walk in every tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sometimes, it is so easy to be really focused,'' Coetzer said.  
``And sometimes, it's so easy to lose concentration.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Spirlea did not give her another chance and closed out the  
match, then left to listen to all the talk about the Williams feud. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody made such a big story of it,'' she said. ``We were  
OK. It is so old. It's already gone.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So is Coetzer, wondering just what happened in a match she  
figured to win. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think I played very well,'' Coetzer said. ``I never  
felt I had any idea what to do. I felt like my focus was not as it 
should be.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Spirlea understood. She's been down that road frequently. Most  
recently near the end of the match on Monday.

<HEADLINE> Calif. Handyman Confession Cited </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FRESNO, Calif. (AP) -- A motel handyman who admitted beheading a  
Yosemite naturalist also confessed to sexually assaulting two 
teen-age sightseers before they were killed, the government said in 
court documents filed Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Cary Stayner told the FBI he sexually assaulted Silvina Pelosso  
and Juli Sund in their room at the Cedar Lodge before killing them, 
according to a six-page affidavit to support a request for bodily 
fluid samples. A judge ordered Stayner to comply. 
</P>
<P>
	Stayner also led the FBI to the knives he says he used to  
decapitate Joie Armstrong and slash the throat of Juli Sund, the 
affidavit says. The knives appeared to have dried blood on them, 
and investigators expected to lift fingerprints and other evidence 
from them, the FBI said. 
</P>
<P>
	The affidavit is the first public acknowledgment by  
investigators that the two teen-age victims were sexually assaulted 
before they and Ms. Sund's mother, Carole Sund, were killed. 
Stayner is the prime suspect but has not been charged in their 
deaths. 
</P>
<P>
	Stayner, 38, has been charged with murder in the July 21 death  
of Ms. Armstrong, a naturalist who led outdoor education programs 
at the park. In a jailhouse interview with a television reporter, 
he claimed he didn't sexually assault any of the women. 
</P>
<P>
	Stayner has fought a request to give samples of his blood, hair  
and saliva to the FBI. 
</P>
<P>
	Stayner lived and worked at the Cedar Lodge, the last place the  
three sightseers were seen alive in February. Analysis by the FBI 
crime lab has yielded trace evidence including ``hairs in vacuum 
sweepings'' and ``possible bodily fluid stains on a blanket seized 
in the room,'' the affidavit says. 
</P>
<P>
	The crime lab has also recovered two partial fingerprints from  
the anonymous letter that Stayner claims to have authored and 
mailed to the FBI's Modesto office in March, directing 
investigators to Juli Sund's body. 
</P>
<P>
	At Stayner's direction, investigators also seized the camouflage  
pants and black shorts he was wearing the night he says he killed 
the sightseers.

<HEADLINE> Judge Holds Off on Ford Ruling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- A Web site that posted secret blueprints and  
business plans from Ford Motor Co. has gone back online -- but 
without the content that landed its owner in federal court. 
</P>
<P>
	A federal judge will rule by Sept. 7 whether Robert Lane, a  
32-year-old nursing student and Ford enthusiast, violated company 
trade secrets and copyright law when he posted Ford internal 
documents on the Web site. 
</P>
<P>
	Lane and his site, www.BlueOvalNews.com, are under a temporary  
restraining order issued last Wednesday ordering him to remove the 
documents and any material copyrighted by Ford. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Nancy G. Edmunds said Monday she will decide  
within the next week whether the Dearborn resident can repost any 
of the 112 Ford documents he claims to have received from anonymous 
sources. Edmunds said she needed time to research the question, and 
that few, if any, cases had addressed the issues before. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the documents is an internal memo detailing problems with  
the 1999 Mustang SVT Cobra. Ford announced recently that all 5,300 
models sold had been recalled to fix exhaust problems that cut as 
much as 50 horsepower from the 320 horsepower the car is supposed 
to have. 
</P>
<P>
	Lane and his attorney claim Lane is a journalist, and the limits  
against BlueOvalNews are an illegal prior restraint. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think Ford wants to discuss the First Amendment,  
because if they discuss the First Amendment, they'll lose,'' said 
attorney Mark Pickrell. 
</P>
<P>
	But Ford claims Lane has ``inflicted irreparable harm'' by  
posting blueprints for new engines, schedules for new vehicles and 
product planning memos. It wants Lane permanently barred from 
putting the documents online, and may also seek damages against 
him. 
</P>
<P>
	``Lane has used his Web site ... and the celebrity status it has  
gained in a guerrilla campaign of threats, innuendoes, dissembling 
and illegal actions,'' Ford said in a court filing. 
</P>
<P>
	The site was shut down Friday after Ford sent a copy of the  
temporary restraining order to the Missouri-based company that puts 
the site on the Web. 
</P>
<P>
	Ryan Elledge, an official with CommuniTech.Net Inc., said the  
site was taken off the Internet to comply with the order. Elledge 
also said BlueOvalNews was also violating its agreement with 
CommuniTech, which prohibits copyright infringement on Web sites it 
hosts. 
</P>
<P>
	During the hearing, Edmunds said Ford must help Lane put parts  
of the site not in dispute back online. A few pages of Lane's 
writings about the case were back on-line Monday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	Lane testified that he started the site to inform the public  
about Ford news and share his enthusiasm; he owns four Mustangs. He 
said the documents were mailed or delivered to his home 
anonymously. 
</P>
<P>
	But Lane said some damaging documents were posted in the hope of  
getting Ford to change some decisions, such as designing a diesel 
engine that might fail future emissions standards. Other documents 
included a list of engines for future cars and trucks, and a 
blueprint of an engine cylinder head. 
</P>
<P>
	Ernie Brooks, an attorney for Ford, challenged Lane's claims of  
being a journalist, saying Lane's mass posting of documents was a 
clear violation of state trade secret laws and copyright 
protection. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't find the pleas that he's a pure journalist is all  
that credible,'' Brooks said.

<HEADLINE> Researchers Seek Sleep Syndrome Gene </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Scientists are searching for the gene that  
throws some people's body clock out of sync with the rest of the 
world. They hope finding it will shed light on how to deal with 
jet-lag, insomnia and other problems. 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers at the University of Utah discovered that a syndrome  
that causes some people to have an abnormal wake-sleep rhythm runs 
in families, following the same pattern as traits like eye color 
that depend on a single gene. 
</P>
<P>
	Louis Ptacek and colleagues report in today's edition of the  
journal Nature Medicine that they found 29 people in three families 
with the problem, called ``familial advanced sleep-phase syndrome'' 
because it shifts the normal wake and sleep pattern forward by 
three to four hours. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think this is a really exciting finding,'' commented David  
Earnest of Texas A&AMP;M University, who studies the cell biology of 
the circadian clock that regulates sleep and wake patterns. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the first time that anyone has identified a  
genetically inherited trait that involves the expression and 
control of the circadian rhythm in humans. That's really 
critical,'' said Earnest, who was not part of Ptacek's team. 
</P>
<P>
	He said scientists have long sought a disease or mutation in  
humans that is directly associated with an unusual circadian 
rhythm. They want to learn how that affects mental health and to 
understand its role in problems such as jet lag and seasonal 
affective disorder -- better known as winter blues -- which is common 
in northern areas. 
</P>
<P>
	The people studied by Ptacek's group just can't stay up much  
later than 8:30 at night and tend to wake up around 5:30 in the 
morning. 
</P>
<P>
	The normal population contains plenty of ``morning lark'' and  
``night owl'' people who function better at different times of day, 
but people with this syndrome are not simply morning people, Ptacek 
emphasized. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a situation which is quite comparable to the changes  
that occur normally in aging humans,'' Ptacek said. ``Most aged 
humans, starting around age 65 or 70, show these sorts of changes, 
reporting problems sleeping, usually marked by earlier onset to 
sleep ... frequent waking in the night. But this is a genetically 
linked trait, not simply aging, as it appears at an earlier age,'' 
Ptacek explained 
</P>
<P>
	Most creatures seem to operate on a biological clock  
approximately synchronized to a 24-hour day. This rhythm controls a 
variety of daily biochemical and behavioral cycles including 
fluctuations in sleep and wakefulness. 
</P>
<P>
	For people with this syndrome the cycle is shorter and the  
constant conflict between their body clock and coping with the rest 
of the world leads to their shifted sleep-wake rhythm. 
</P>
<P>
	``These aren't diseases per se, and most people just live with  
this sleep pattern and never see a doctor about it,'' Ptacek said. 
Some cope with it fairly well, but it can be disabling for others. 
</P>
<P>
	Now that they have determined the syndrome is caused by a single  
gene, the scientists are working to identify the specific one. 
</P>
<P>
	That's important because finding the gene could lead them to the  
protein it produces to cause the body's time shift -- a discovery 
that could then lead to the development of drugs to treat not only 
the syndrome, but also jet lag and other conditions. 
</P>
<P>
	But, said Ptacek, ``we need to understand the normal biology  
first. Then we can work on altering the clock and helping people 
who fly or do shift work.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Presumably, this protein is just one of the gears in the  
(body) clock. By studying one gear we can get a handle on the other 
gears around it and we may get an insight about why they have this 
trait and how the normal clock functions,'' he said in a telephone 
interview. 
</P>
<P>
	The search for the gene may be arduous.  
</P>
<P>
	``There are approximately 80,000 genes in the human genome; this  
is a single one of those 80,000. Think of the genome as a library 
with 80,000 books, and we're looking for a spelling error in a 
single book,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Packers Trade WR Mayes to Seattle </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GREEN BAY, Wis. (AP) -- The Seattle Seahawks acquired wide  
receiver Derrick Mayes on Monday from the Green Bay Packers in 
exchange for an undisclosed draft choice. 
</P>
<P>
	The Seahawks have been unable to convince their top receiver,  
Joey Galloway, to report to the team. Galloway is trying to 
renegotiate his contract with Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
	The trade reunites Mayes, a fourth-year pro from Notre Dame,  
with Seahawks coach and general manager Mike Holmgren, who was 
Mayes' coach in Green Bay. 
</P>
<P>
	``We feel very fortunate to get a player of his caliber,''  
Holmgren said. 
</P>
<P>
	Holmgren said Mayes, who will join the Seahawks on Tuesday, will  
be able to play in Thursday's game against the Indianapolis Colts 
because Seattle runs the same West Coast offense favored by the 
Packers. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were thin at wide receiver,'' Holmgren said. ``This move, I  
think, could be pretty good for us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Packers GM Ron Wolf said he and Holmgren spent the weekend  
working on the deal. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're glad we could get him to a team that suits his  
talents,'' Wolf said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mayes, who was in the final year of his contract, was thought to  
be the leading candidate to start for the Packers opposite Antonio 
Freeman, the league's highest-paid receiver. Mayes said last week 
that he planned on being the starter and wasn't expecting to be 
traded. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Packers had too many receivers vying for too few roster  
spots. In addition to Freeman, Green Bay has veterans Bill 
Schroeder, Desmond Howard and Corey Bradford, while former 
Pittsburgh wideout Jahine Arnold and rookie Donald Driver have been 
impressive during the preseason. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're very pleased with the emergence of our receiving  
corps,'' Wolf said. ``Some people have stepped up, and some people 
have been huge surprises. That made this decision very simple.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mayes is known as an outstanding possession receiver with  
excellent hands, who lacks the speed to be a game-breaker. He also 
has been injury-prone, missing 19 games during his three years with 
the Packers. 
</P>
<P>
	Mayes had a career-high 30 catches for 394 yards and five  
touchdowns last season. 
</P>
<P>
	``Not only do I lose a real good friend, I lose a pretty good  
teammate,'' Freeman said. ``But I learned ... a long time ago that 
this is a business, and this was a business decision.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mayes caught four passes for 40 yards and two touchdowns during  
Green Bay's three preseason games. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've got some good young guys, and the only way they're going  
to get better is to play,'' Green Bay offensive coordinator Sherm 
Lewis said. 
</P>
<P>
	Galloway missed training camp as he sought to renegotiate and  
extend a contract he signed in 1995. He led the Seahawks last 
season with 65 receptions for 1,047 yards and 10 touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
	The Seahawks offered Galloway a seven-year, $35 million deal,  
with a $7 million signing bonus. Galloway wants a five-year, $24 
million contract, with a $9 million signing bonus. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, starting Seahawks receiver Michael Pritchard is out  
2-3 weeks while recovering from knee surgery.

<HEADLINE> Yankees 7, Athletics 4  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Chuck Knoblauch homered and drove in four runs  
as the New York Yankees beat the Oakland Athletics 7-4 Monday night 
to move 2,000 games over .500 in their history. 
</P>
<P>
	The Yankees, who trailed 4-0 in the fifth inning, rallied with  
four runs in the fifth and three in the eighth to improve to 
8,475-6,475 since moving to New York before the 1903 season. 
</P>
<P>
	Oakland fell two games behind Boston in the AL wild-card race.  
The Red Sox beat Kansas City 9-1. The Yankees (81-49) remained one 
game ahead of Cleveland for the best record in the league. 
</P>
<P>
	T.J. Mathews (8-4) walked Bernie Williams leading off the  
eighth. Buddy Groom came in with one out and gave up a single to 
Chili Davis, who was in a 3-for-35 slump, and walked Ricky Ledee. 
</P>
<P>
	Jason Isringhausen, a former Met who rode the subway to Yankee  
Stadium on Monday, failed in his first appearance in New York since 
being traded to Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
	He walked Jorge Posada on four pitches, breaking a 4-4 tie, and  
allowed RBI singles to Luis Sojo and Knoblauch, who finished 
3-for-5. 
</P>
<P>
	Jeff Nelson (2-1) struck out the side in the eighth, and Mariano  
Rivera pitched the ninth for his 38th save in 42 chances. Three 
Yankees relievers combined on 4 2-3 shutout innings. 
</P>
<P>
	Rookie Tim Hudson was brilliant for 4 2-3 innings in his first  
game against the Yankees, allowing only two runners on a walk and 
an error while striking out seven. He overpowered them with his 
fastball and got them to swing at breaking balls that darted out of 
the strike zone. 
</P>
<P>
	Posada lined a single to left-center for the Yankees first hit  
and the first ball hit out of the infield. Sojo then walked on a 
3-2 pitch and things really fell apart for Hudson as he faced the 
order for a third time. 
</P>
<P>
	Knoblauch hit a 1-1 pitch just over the fence in left for his  
14th homer to cut Oakland's lead to 4-3. Derek Jeter then singled 
and scored on Paul O'Neill's double. Bernie Williams walked before 
Hudson got Tino Martinez to fly out to end the fifth inning. 
</P>
<P>
	The Athletics scored two runs in the second and two in the fifth  
to take a 4-0 lead against Hideki Irabu. Ben Grieve led off the 
second with a single and Miguel Tejada hit his 18th homer on the 
first pitch. 
</P>
<P>
	Matt Stairs hit a two-run single with one out in the fifth to  
knock out Irabu. Allen Watson got out of a first-and-third, one-out 
jam by striking Ben Grieve and getting Tejada to ground out. 
</P>
<P>
 *Notes:* Oakland OF Tim Raines, out for the season with Lupus,  
visited his former Yankees teammates and was given his 1998 World 
Series ring by New York manager Joe Torre. ... The Yankees are 
expected to call up OF Darryl Strawberry, INF Clay Bellinger and 
RHP Dan Naulty when rosters expand to 40 on Wednesday. ... Tejada 
has nine homers and 34 RBIs in August. ... John Jaha struck out all 
three times against Irabu. ... Yankees relievers are 4-1 with eight 
saves and a 1.60 ERA in their last 18 games. Rivera has converted 
15 straight save chances and has not allowed a run in 16 2-3 
innings.

<HEADLINE> Umpires Sue Baseball Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- In yet another legal effort to keep their jobs,  
umpires sued baseball in federal court Monday, asking for an 
injunction to keep 22 umps working. 
</P>
<P>
	In papers filed in U.S. District Court in Philadelphia, the  
Major League Umpires Association claimed the 22 are being 
terminated against their will, and union head Richie Phillips said 
``permanent unemployment ... is a virtual certainty.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The leagues' refusal to retain the 22 umpires -- fully a third  
of the umpire work force -- threatens to complete the destruction of 
the union's effectiveness as a collective bargaining agent,'' 
Phillips said. 
</P>
<P>
	Management lawyers think the suit is a rehash of earlier  
allegations. Baseball said the umpires aren't being fired, that it 
accepted the resignations of the 22, effective after Wednesday's 
games, as a result of a failed mass resignation strategy the 
umpires embarked on after the All-Star game. 
</P>
<P>
	The union filed a grievance against the American and National  
leagues late Friday, then went to court Monday. Umpires said they 
would be irreparably harmed if they are let go, partly because they 
would lose health insurance. 
</P>
<P>
	``Immediate injunctive relief is appropriate and necessary to  
maintain the status quo to permit the arbitrator to consider and 
act upon the dispute,'' the 16-page complaint said. ``Unless 
promptly enjoined, the leagues will not cease and desist from their 
unlawful course of action.'' 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge J. Curtis Joyner scheduled a hearing for  
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Umpires also sued baseball July 26, but withdrew the case Aug.  
16 just before the leagues were to file a motion to dismiss. 
Baseball says all of the matters are covered by either binding 
arbitration or the National Labor Relations Board. 
</P>
<P>
	Umpires filed unfair labor practice charges with the NLRB's New  
York regional office Aug. 3, asking the agency to issue a complaint 
and to seek an injunction. The NLRB has not yet ruled on the 
charges. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're still evaluating the evidence,'' Daniel Silverman, the  
NLRB's New York regional director, said Monday. ``I'm still hopeful 
we'll have a decision his week. There won't be a decision before 
the hearing tomorrow.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Presumably in an effort to humanize the case, the complaint  
lists all the umpires scheduled to be terminated along with their 
marital status and the number of children and grandchildren they 
have. 
</P>
<P>
	Umpires, who held a series of three conference calls Monday,  
said the sport would be injured if the 22, who have a combined 355 
years of major league experience, were let go. 
</P>
<P>
	``The baseball-loving public will be harmed by having less than  
the best umpires in place during this critical portion of the 1999 
season, as well as the playoffs,'' they said in a a 34-page legal 
brief filed Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The brief began with a quote from President Nixon, who  
arbitrated a 1985 dispute between umpires and baseball. 
</P>
<P>
	``The leagues should recognize that umpires have a special  
relationship to the game, which is different from that of 
players,'' Nixon said. ``Umpires should not be treated as employees 
but as judges who are independent of both players and owners, whose 
primary responsibility is to maintain the integrity of the game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The brief went on to say that unless the court issues an  
injunction baseball ``will succeed in destroying two of the most 
sacred principles in major league baseball: the independence and 
integrity of major league umpires and the sanctity of arbitrating 
disputes under the collective bargaining agreement.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Umpires, fearful baseball would lock them out after their labor  
contract expires Dec. 31, announced July 14 they would quit en 
masse to try to force an early start to negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
	But the strategy backfired when 27 of the 68 umpires either  
refused to resign or withdrew their resignations. Baseball then 
hired 25 new umpires from the minors and accepted 22 resignations, 
effective Sept. 2. 
</P>
<P>
	``These hirings ... were devoid of any legitimate business  
justification,'' Phillips said in an affidavit filed with the suit. 
``These July 22 hirings were designed to punish the union and 
undermine its support.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Acknowledging that umpires have split into pro- and  
anti-Phillips factions, the brief said ``the union will effectively 
be gutted and rendered powerless'' if the 22 are let go because 
they are among the most hard-core supporters of the union 
leadership. The court case in Philadelphia will be a key to 
Phillips' future. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously, if we win tomorrow's case in court, his stock goes  
up tremendously,'' NL umpire Terry Tata said. ``If not, that's to 
be evaluated as time goes along.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Umpires now claim they never intended to quit, and the  
resignations were merely symbolic. They also claimed AL ump Drew 
Coble, one of the 22, never actually resigned. 
</P>
<P>
	Joyner was appointed to the federal bench by President Bush in  
November 1991. A resident of West Chester, Pa., he had been a judge 
on the Chester County Court of Common Pleas since 1987 before 
joining the District Court.

<HEADLINE> NHL To Vote on Lemieux Wednesday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- Mario Lemieux may be one day away from owning  
the Pittsburgh Penguins, the team he led to two Stanley Cup 
championships earlier this decade. 
</P>
<P>
	Lemieux, who spent last week closing on his $95 million purchase  
of the bankrupt franchise, will meet Wednesday with the NHL's 
executive committee to review his takeover. 
</P>
<P>
	Unless the executive committee detects any unforeseen problems  
in the Lemieux plan, Lemieux is expected to be voted in as an owner 
during an NHL Board of Governors meeting that afternoon in New 
York. 
</P>
<P>
	Swift approval is expected since the league already has endorsed  
Lemieux's takeover, the first in one of the four major North 
American pro sports by a recently retired player. 
</P>
<P>
	Lemieux, a six-time NHL scoring champion, retired following the  
1997 season. By converting $25 million in deferred salary and cash 
into an equity stake, he will have the largest financial stake of 
an ownership group that numbers more than a dozen investors. 
</P>
<P>
	Approval on Wednesday would come only three days before the  
Penguins open training camp.

<HEADLINE> Marc Anthony Releases New Album </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) -- Marc Anthony says his new  
English-language album is ``just another way of expressing 
myself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The salsa singer's foray into pop comes as another local  
favorite, Ricky Martin, continues to smash sales records with his 
own English debut. Martin is Puerto Rican, while Anthony was born 
in New York to Puerto Rican parents. 
</P>
<P>
	During a Monday visit to San Juan to promote the album's Sept.  
28 release, Anthony told reporters he was not abandoning fans of 
his three salsa records. 
</P>
<P>
	Anthony has sold three million albums in Spanish, and his  
``Contra la Corriente'' won a Grammy this year for best tropical 
Latin performance. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is just another way of expressing myself through my  
music,'' Anthony said. Recording in English, he said, ``is 
something I've always wanted to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Anthony said his next album will be in Spanish.

<HEADLINE> Injuries Take Toll on NFL Teams </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	St. Louis lost its starting quarterback for the season, and the  
NFL might have seen the last of one of football's most intense 
players. 
</P>
<P>
	Saturday night's exhibition games provided trainers around the  
league with plenty of work, as a number of players went down with 
injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	St. Louis Rams quarterback Trent Green tore the anterior  
cruciate ligament in his left knee, sustained a third-degree sprain 
of the medial collateral ligament and also had cartilage damage in 
a 24-21 victory over San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
	Cleveland linebacker Chris Spielman could announce his  
retirement today after sustaining a ``stinger'' during the Browns' 
35-24 win over Chicago when he was blindsided by Bears center Casey 
Wiegmann while trying to cut back on a screen play. 
</P>
<P>
	Other significant players injured in Saturday night's games were  
New Orleans starting quarterback Billy Joe Hobert, Miami running 
Cecil Collins and New York Giants center Brian Williams. 
</P>
<P>
	Reconstructive surgery on Green's knee will be scheduled when  
the swelling subsides in about 2-3 weeks. Dr. Robert Shively, the 
Rams' physician, estimated the recovery period at 13 months. 
</P>
<P>
	The injury occurred when Chargers strong safety Rodney Harrison,  
blitzing on the play, lunged at the back of Green's knees just 
after a pass was thrown. Green completed all 11 of his attempts 
before the injury. 
</P>
<P>
	``I knew it was gone,'' Green said. ``I just felt it grind and  
snap. I heard the whole thing. It was a very uncomfortable 
situation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kurt Warner, an NFL Europe and Arena Football League veteran who  
has just one quarter of NFL experience, became St. Louis' starter 
by default. The team also acquired Paul Justin from Oakland as 
insurance Sunday, giving up a seventh-round pick in next year's 
draft. 
</P>
<P>
	Spielman, attempting a comeback from neck fusion surgery in  
1997, might retire after a violent helmet-on-helmet collision sent 
him to the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	After shedding and spinning off one blocker, Spielman turned and  
before he could get his feet planted, Wiegmann crushed him. 
</P>
<P>
	Spielman stayed on the ground for several moments, and later  
told Cleveland offensive tackle Lomas Brown, who also played with 
him in Detroit, that he had been momentarily paralyzed. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's exploring all of his options,'' said Browns coach Chris  
Palmer, who spoke to Spielman twice on Sunday. ``He's going to look 
at everything and go from there. What we want to do is sit back 
take a look at things, let things settle down for 24 hours both 
emotionally and physically and then talk about the subject at that 
time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He got a scare in training camp when he was blasted by fullback  
Tarek Saleh, a blow that sent him to the hospital for an MRI. 
</P>
<P>
	Chicago lost backup defensive tackle Jimmy Herndon for the  
season with a torn ACL in his left knee. 
</P>
<P>
	Hobert is expected to miss the Saints' final preseason game  
after fracturing one of his ribs. 
</P>
<P>
	Hobert completed 10 of 15 passes for 179 yards and two  
touchdowns before a helmet to his right side fractured the rib. 
</P>
<P>
	``It shouldn't be that big a deal,'' Hobert said, although he  
admitted he was in pain just standing still. ``If they wanted me to 
play in the next game, I could as long as I wore a protective rib 
vest.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Saints plan to hold Hobert out of Thursday's preseason game  
against Tennessee and have him ready for the opener against 
Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
	Miami was relieved to learn tests showed Collins had no break in  
his injured right ankle, giving him a chance to heal for the season 
opener. 
</P>
<P>
	Collins, the Dolphins' fifth-round draft pick, will be on  
crutches for a few days and miss Thursday's game at Green Bay. 
There's a possibility he could be ready when Miami opens the season 
Sept. 13 at Denver. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm glad it wasn't serious,'' said Collins, who leads the team  
with 34 carries and 144 yards. ``I'm going to work hard with the 
trainers to do everything I can to try and get ready as soon as 
possible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	An MRI exam showed Collins aggravated an injury Collins  
sustained two years ago at LSU. Collins broke his right leg and 
damaged ankle ligaments in an October 1997 game against Vanderbilt. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams, attempting a comeback after missing two seasons with  
an eye injury, sprained his left knee in the first half of a 16-10 
loss to the New York Jets. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams' injury doesn't appear to be that serious, coach Jim  
Fassel said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	The veteran center had an MRI and there appears to be no  
structural damage. While Fassel is optimistic, he would not say 
when Williams will be back until he speaks with Dr. Russell Warren, 
the team's orthopedic surgeon.

field the next day or so after suffering a lower back contusion in 
the third quarter of Thursday's 17-13 loss to the Minnesota 
Vikings. 
</P>
<P>
	``It feels great,'' Pederson said following treatment on his  
back Sunday. ``I took today off to help it heal.''

Pro Bowl defensive end Michael McCrary, who reportedly left the 
team over the weekend after discussions over a possible extension 
reached an impasse. The Ravens, however, insisted that McCrary 
never informed them of that decision. 
</P>
<P>
	McCrary underwent offseason knee surgery and wasn't supposed to  
play Saturday anyway. The players were given Sunday off, so McCrary 
won't be considered AWOL until today, when he is scheduled to begin 
practice for Friday's exhibition finale against the New York

<HEADLINE> American To Integrate Reno Air </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FORT WORTH, Texas (AP) -- American Airlines is merging Reno Air  
Inc. into its system today, about eight months after the nation's 
second-largest airline purchased the low-cost carrier. 
</P>
<P>
	American's parent company, AMR Corp., met with its pilots on  
Monday in a last-minute attempt to work out a deal over how the 
merger would occur. No details were released on the results of the 
talks. 
</P>
<P>
	The two sides have disagreed over how pilots would be integrated  
into the company since Fort Worth, Texas-based American bought tiny 
Reno last December. 
</P>
<P>
	The dispute evolved into a pilot sickout in February that  
stranded hundreds of thousands of passengers all over the world and 
cost the company $225 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The Allied Pilots Association and American continued to  
negotiate since the illegal job action, but were unable to reach a 
solution. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the sticking points in the deal was protocol for any  
future acquisitions. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were able to conclude deals with two other unions  
relatively quickly, but after more than nine months of negotiation 
and mediation we are still without an agreement with APA,'' Robert 
Baker, executive vice president of operations, wrote to the 
company's 9,500 pilots. 
</P>
<P>
	American's integration plan brings former Reno pilots into the  
company at the bottom of the seniority list. That means lower-paid 
Reno pilots will get a boost in their salaries, but they will have 
less say in their flying schedules. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, a dozen American pilots who underwent training in July  
will now hold captain jobs formerly held by their Reno 
counterparts. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the union has been reminding the pilots that they  
must not repeat the February sickout. That illegal job action 
resulted in a federal judge holding the union in contempt when his 
order to return to work was ignored. 
</P>
<P>
	During talks with the judge, the APA agreed to a permanent  
injunction barring the union and its members from any future 
actions -- strike, sickout or slowdown. That decision leaves the 
union with no recourse but to ultimately accept American's decision 
to go forward with integration, according to observers. 
</P>
<P>
	The union has e-mailed its members that U.S. District Judge Joe  
Kendall's order remains in effect and that the APA must comply. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge also ordered the pilots' union to pay a $45 million  
judgment as punishment for the sickout. The union has promised an 
appeal of the massive award, which is larger than the union's net 
worth.

<HEADLINE> Rams Trade Mitch Jacoby to Chiefs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- The St. Louis Rams traded backup tight end  
Mitch Jacoby to the Kansas City Chiefs on Monday for an undisclosed 
draft pick. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rams also released 10 players, reducing the roster to 66.  
NFL teams must reduce their rosters to 65 by 4 p.m. EDT Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Among those cut was seventh-round draft pick Rodney Williams, a  
punter from Georgia Tech. 
</P>
<P>
	Jacoby, 6-foot-4 and 260 pounds, was used primarily on special  
teams by the Rams. He started two games in two seasons, catching 
two passes for 10 yards. He had 10 special-teams tackles in 1997, 
and three last season, when he played just five games after tearing 
a thumb ligament in the preseason. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rams also placed tight end Ernie Conwell and tackle Todd  
Frohbieter on the physically-unable-to-perform list. That means 
that after the sixth week of the season, the Rams will have 21 days 
to determine if the players should be placed on the active roster, 
on injured reserve, waived or traded. 
</P>
<P>
	St. Louis put quarterback Trent Green and center John Flannery  
on injured reserve. Both will miss the entire season. Green, signed 
as a free agent in the offseason, sustained a serious knee injury 
in Saturday's 24-21 preseason win over San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
	Green was 11-for-11 in the game and completed 28 of 32 preseason  
passes. 
</P>
<P>
	Other players cut Monday included wide receivers Tony Small and  
Daniel Jones; quarterback Gus Ornstein; defensive linemen Brian 
Lytle and Alton Weaver; safety Van Hiles, cornerbacks Marvin Love 
and Damon Troy; and tackle Roger Chanoine.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Open Gets Underway </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Philip King was delighted when he drew former  
Wimbledon champion Richard Krajicek as today's first-round opponent 
in the U.S. Open tennis championships. 
</P>
<P>
	He figured it could have been worse.  
</P>
<P>
	``My last tournament, I was drawn against Pete Sampras,'' said  
King, from Long Beach, Calif. ``I thought, `Can we do it again?''' 
</P>
<P>
	The 17-year-old King was given a wild card into the century's  
final Grand Slam tournament by winning the USTA National Boys' 
18-and-under championship earlier this month in Kalamazoo, Mich. He 
also participated in last Wednesday's draw ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
	In their first-round match in Los Angeles in July, King lost  
6-1, 6-2 to Sampras. But the young right-hander put a positive spin 
on it. 
</P>
<P>
	``California helped me out a lot,'' King said of the loss to the  
world's top-ranked player. ``I can do the same here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	King, who also won the Easter Bowl Boys' 18 title in Grenelefe,  
Fla., in April, wanted to play Krajicek ``on center court before a 
packed crowd'' in Arthur Ashe Stadium. Instead, the match was 
scheduled for 10,000-seat Louis Armstrong Stadium, until two years 
ago the centerpiece of the National Tennis Center. 
</P>
<P>
	The opening match in Arthur Ashe Stadium, which seats more than  
22,000, is be 10th-seeded Arantxa Sanchez-Vicario, the 1994 U.S. 
Open winner, against Australian teen-ager Jelena Dokic, a qualifier 
who surprised top-seeded Martina Hingis in the first round at 
Wimbledon. 
</P>
<P>
	Hingis, who captured the U.S. Open two years ago, takes the  
court tonight against Kveta Hrdlickova of the Czech Republic. 
</P>
<P>
	Also scheduled to play today was third-seeded Venus Williams,  
who captured her fifth title of the year Saturday when she defeated 
No. 2 Lindsay Davenport in the final of a tournament in New Haven, 
Conn. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the past, Lindsay overpowered me,'' the 19-year-old  
Williams said. ``But I've gotten older and stronger, and I have 
better technique.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That was evident in Williams' blistering groundstrokes, huge  
serves and quicker court coverage, all too much for the 23-year-old 
Davenport to handle. 
</P>
<P>
	``Venus is going to be tough to beat,'' Davenport said of  
Williams' chances at the Open. ``She's athletic and extremely fast. 
Those are some great assets to have.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In another early match, sixth-seeded Amanda Coetzer of South  
Africa took on Romanian Irina Spirlea, who is best known for 
bumping Williams during their semifinal match in Arthur Ashe 
Stadium two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	In the men's draw, the top-seeded Sampras is going for his fifth  
U.S. Open title and a record 13th Grand Slam tournament title. No. 
2 Andre Agassi is seeking to build on his French Open victory and 
runner-up finish at Wimbledon, and Patrick Rafter is going after a 
third consecutive U.S. Open win. 
</P>
<P>
	But there are newcomers who could topple any of them, including  
Russian teen-ager Marat Safin, who faces Sampras in the first 
round. Safin also is coming into the Open with confidence, having 
won a tournament Sunday in Brookline, Mass., upsetting Britain's 
Greg Rusedski 6-4, 7-6 (13-11). 
</P>
<P>
	Mark Philippoussis, who played in his first Grand Slam  
tournament final here last year, has withdraw from this year's 
tournament because of a knee injury he suffered during a 
quarterfinal match against Sampras at Wimbledon. 
</P>
<P>
	Felix Mantilla was moved into the 11th-seeded Philippoussis'  
place in the draw and seeded 17th.

<HEADLINE> Judge Holds Off on Ford Ruling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- A federal judge will rule by Sept. 7 whether a  
self-proclaimed Ford enthusiast violated company trade secrets and 
copyright law when he posted internal Ford Motor Co. documents on 
his Web site. 
</P>
<P>
	Robert Lane is under a temporary restraining order issued last  
Wednesday ordering him to remove the documents and any material 
copyrighted by Ford. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Nancy G. Edmunds said Monday she will decide  
within the next week whether the Dearborn resident can repost any 
of the 112 Ford documents he claims to have received from anonymous 
sources. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the documents is an internal memo detailing problems with  
the 1999 Mustang SVT Cobra. Ford announced recently that all 5,300 
models sold had been recalled to fix exhaust problems that cut as 
much as 50 horsepower from the 320 horsepower the car is supposed 
to have. 
</P>
<P>
	Lane and his attorney claim Lane is a journalist, and the limits  
against his site, www.BlueOvalNews.com, are an illegal prior 
restraint. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think Ford wants to discuss the First Amendment,  
because if they discuss the First Amendment, they'll lose,'' said 
attorney Mark Pickrell. 
</P>
<P>
	But Ford claims Lane, a 32-year-old nursing student, has  
``inflicted irreparable harm'' by posting blueprints for new 
engines, schedules for new vehicles and product planning memos. It 
wants Lane permanently barred from putting the documents online, 
and may also seek damages against him. 
</P>
<P>
	``Lane has used his Web site ... and the celebrity status it has  
gained in a guerrilla campaign of threats, innuendoes, dissembling 
and illegal actions,'' Ford said in a court filing. 
</P>
<P>
	The site was shut down Friday after Ford sent a copy of the  
temporary restraining order to the Missouri-based company that puts 
the site on the Web. 
</P>
<P>
	Ryan Elledge, an official with CommuniTech.Net Inc., said the  
site was taken off the Internet to comply with the order. Elledge 
also said BlueOvalNews was also violating its agreement with 
CommuniTech, which prohibits copyright infringement on Web sites it 
hosts. 
</P>
<P>
	During the hearing, Edmunds said Ford must help Lane put parts  
of the site not in dispute back online. It was restored Monday 
afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	Lane testified that he started the site to inform the public  
about Ford news and share his enthusiasm; he owns four Mustangs. He 
said the documents were mailed or delivered to his home 
anonymously.

	But Lane said some damaging documents were posted in the hope of  
getting Ford to change some decisions, such as designing a diesel 
engine that might fail future emissions standards. 
</P>
<P>
	Ernie Brooks, an attorney for Ford, challenged Lane's claims of  
being a journalist, saying Lane's mass posting of documents was a 
clear violation of state trade secret laws and copyright 
protection. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't find the pleas that he's a pure journalist is all  
that credible,'' Brooks said. 
</P>
<P>
	Edmunds said she needed time to research the question, and that  
few, if any, cases had addressed the issues before.

<HEADLINE> Kenyan Admits Fixing Track Race </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEVILLE, Spain (AP) -- Bernard Barmasai lost his shot at a share  
of the $1 million Golden League jackpot today for saying he had 
colluded with a countryman to determine the result of a race. 
</P>
<P>
	An International Amateur Athletic Federation panel ruled  
Barmasai put ``athletics into disrepute'' by saying he had asked 
fellow Kenyan Christopher Koskei not to challenge his lead late in 
the 3,000-meter steeplechase at the Aug. 11 Weltklasse meet in 
Zurich, Switzerland. 
</P>
<P>
	The sport's world governing body considered stripping Barmasai  
of his victory in the race but let it stand, saying there was not 
enough evidence of collusion between the two runners. 
</P>
<P>
	Barmasai, the world-record holder in the steeplechase, said  
after winning at Zurich that he had spoken to Koskei during the 
race. 
</P>
<P>
	``I said, `Leave it for me,' and that's why he slowed down,''  
Barmasai said at the time. 
</P>
<P>
	``The decision was taken on the basis of the code of conduct.  
One of these rules states that an athlete who puts athletics into 
disrepute can be sanctioned in some way,'' IAAF spokesman Giorgio 
Reineri said. 
</P>
<P>
	Barmasai had been one of four athletes still in contention for  
the Golden League jackpot, which is split among those who go 
unbeaten through the seven biggest Grand Prix meets on the circuit. 
</P>
<P>
	American sprinter Marion Jones, 800-meter record-holder Wilson  
Kipketer, and distance runner Gabriela Szabo are still alive for at 
least a share of the $1 million jackpot with two meets remaining. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones, though, injured her back in Seville and is likely out for  
the season. 
</P>
<P>
	Koskei took the steeplechase gold medal at the World  
Championships last week. Barmasai finished fifth.

<HEADLINE> Holtz Worried About Gamecocks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) -- Lou Holtz looks at his South Carolina  
football team and sees concerns just about everywhere. 
</P>
<P>
	His offensive line is small and inexperienced. His defensive  
secondary is without leader Arturo Freeman, who ruptured his spleen 
last week and will miss at least four weeks. Late Monday, Freeman 
had his spleen removed in surgery in Charlotte and could be back in 
Columbia as early as today. 
</P>
<P>
	Holtz also worries about his quarterback, the running game, the  
kicking game. 
</P>
<P>
	The young Gamecocks lack depth and experience. Holtz openly  
questions their physical toughness and conditioning. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't honestly tell you a strength of our football team,  
other than the fact we've worked hard,'' Holtz said. ``I can tell 
you where I have a lot of concerns.'' 
</P>
<P>
	You'd think he wouldn't want to play No. 24 North Carolina State  
(1-0) on Saturday in the Gamecocks' season opener. 
</P>
<P>
	No, Holtz says, ``I feel so emotional about this game and I  
don't think I'll have any problem getting this team ready to go.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He's back on the sidelines after two years in television as an  
analyst for CBS. 
</P>
<P>
	He talks about how getting back into coaching has sharpened his  
mind and improved his memory. 
</P>
<P>
	He talks about waking up in the middle of the night in a cold  
sweat trying to figure out how to beat N.C. State, which opened 
last weekend with a 23-20 victory at Texas that knocked the 
Longhorns out of the Top 25. 
</P>
<P>
	He talks about the rapid passage of time since he was hired in  
December. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Holtz said, ``When you spend as many years on the  
sidelines as I have, it's not a big adjustment when you've been 
away from it for two years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Monday's news conference was in many ways a replay of what Holtz  
has said and said again during the recent months of intense media 
and fan attention. 
</P>
<P>
	Once again, he said turning around the Gamecocks, 1-10 last  
season, is unlike any of the other five college football rebuilding 
projects he's undertaken. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the Gamecocks have noticed Holtz's enthusiasm. Senior  
running back Boo Williams says it has infected the entire coaching 
staff 
</P>
<P>
	``He's been real intense in practice lately and really picky,''  
Williams said. ``It's the first game and everybody is anxious to 
get out there and play.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the potential problems.

<HEADLINE> Survey Says Job Prospects Are Good </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- U.S. demand for workers continues at the highest  
level in two decades, with employment especially strong in the 
wholesale and retail trades in advance of Christmas, according to a 
new survey. 
</P>
<P>
	A quarterly survey of some 16,000 companies by Manpower Inc.  
indicated that 30 percent planned further hiring in the 
October-December quarter. Just 8 percent anticipated cutbacks, 
while 58 percent said they expected no change. The remaining 4 
percent were unsure, according to the survey, which is being 
released Monday by the nation's largest temporary staffing 
business. 
</P>
<P>
	The fourth-quarter figures are slightly weaker than the  
July-September quarter, when 32 percent of those responding 
expected to be hiring. But when adjusted for seasonal variations, 
prospects for job seekers are actually improved, Manpower said. 
</P>
<P>
	The findings by Manpower suggest that strong job creation should  
continue to hold U.S. unemployment in check. The nation's 
unemployment rate has been at or below 4.5 percent for more than a 
year, the best showing in three decades. 
</P>
<P>
	The survey results have been strong for three years, said  
Jeffrey Joerres, president and chief executive of Manpower, which 
is based in Milwaukee. 
</P>
<P>
	``We haven't seen an unbroken trend of this length since the  
1976-79 period,'' he said in a statement released Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``From the latest quarter's figures, we can clearly see that the  
labor market will be going into the new millennium roaring. As we 
look into the year 2000, we see no slowdown from a demand 
perspective,'' he added in an earlier interview with The Associated 
Press. 
</P>
<P>
	The report cited ``the critical need for holiday help'' as the  
reason that the strongest demand in the fourth quarter is expected 
in wholesale and retail industries. 
</P>
<P>
	It said 40 percent of wholesalers and retailers expected to  
increase hiring. Forty-eight percent said they saw no change, 8 
percent anticipated a decrease and the rest said they didn't know. 
</P>
<P>
	The figures suggest that retail companies ``are very optimistic  
about what is coming up'' this holiday season, Joerres said. 
</P>
<P>
	In the latest survey, companies in Western states anticipated  
the most hiring, followed by the Midwest, South and Northeast, the 
report said. 
</P>
<P>
	Manpower said its survey was based on telephone interviews with  
companies in 484 U.S. cities. The results have a margin of error of 
plus or minus 2 percentage points.

<HEADLINE>  Clintons Visit New York State Fair </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SYRACUSE, N.Y. (AP) -- They could have been any couple stepping  
up to a taffy stand at the New York State Fair. ``Let's get a 
variety pack!'' the wife said, as the husband pulled a wad of bills 
from his pants pocket. 
</P>
<P>
	But with television news cameras rolling, the proprietor  
wouldn't hear of taking $6.95 from President Clinton and his wife, 
all-but-declared Senate candidate Hillary Rodham Clinton, whose 
visit to the fair seemed like a perfect campaign moment. 
</P>
<P>
	Adoring crowds stood by the corn dog and sausage stands to  
glimpse the couple, who shook hands, posed for pictures and signed 
autographs for nearly two hours under sunny skies. 
</P>
<P>
	At the dairy exhibit, Mrs. Clinton and daughter Chelsea stopped  
at the front counter, where Mrs. Clinton invited reporters and 
photographers to glasses of milk. ``Anybody else?'' a beaming Mrs. 
Clinton asked. ``Chocolate or white?'' 
</P>
<P>
	She had good reason to be beaming. It seemed that well-wishers  
were everywhere she turned during the first family's first vacation 
in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	On the road to Skaneatles, where the Clintons will spend the  
remainder of their vacation on a borrowed estate, they stopped at a 
lemonade stand where two boys waved a sign promising them free 
refreshments. 
</P>
<P>
	Up the road, three dozen people waited to greet them. After  
winding another boy's camera to make sure he got the shot, the 
president shook hands and stepped back into his bronze Suburban. 
</P>
<P>
	But the motorcade wasn't ready to roll. Clinton waited with his  
arms folded, chin in hand, and admired his wife as she chatted with 
the young girls who stepped up to greet her and shook every last 
hand in the line. 
</P>
<P>
	It was as if he was sizing up the family's next political star.  
Asked what advice he had for her, he said, ``I think she's doing 
pretty well without any help from me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton, in fact, has had plenty of help from her husband.  
</P>
<P>
	The family vacation in the Hamptons on Long Island, the Finger  
Lakes region of upstate New York and Martha's Vineyard off the 
coast of Massachusetts included several fund-raisers for the 
Democratic party and Mrs. Clinton's own exploratory committee. New 
York is one of the states where the president is most popular. 
</P>
<P>
	Arriving at the Syracuse airport, more than 2,500 cheering  
well-wishers greeted the Clintons. One woman held a sign saying 
``Clinton for Senate.'' Others offered notecards, flowers, babies 
to hold, and pressed forward for pictures. 
</P>
<P>
	At Mrs. Clinton's side along the rope line was Mike Bragman, the  
influential majority leader of the state assembly. The president 
and first lady addressed an annual luncheon hosted by the state 
comptroller, where Clinton renewed his call for using the federal 
budget surplus to shore up the retirement system. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton compared America's good economic times to ``farmers  
sitting on a good crop'' and trying to decide how best to build on 
the bounty. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you're at the state fair, you need to think like that,''  
Clinton said. ``If America is a farm, and we're the farm family, 
and we've had years of great crops and we've got a lot of money in 
the bank, what are we going to do with it?''

<HEADLINE> USOC's Schultz To Step Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLORADO SPRINGS, Colo. (AP) -- Dick Schultz, executive director  
of the U.S. Olympic Committee since 1995, will step down next year 
as part of a sweeping reorganization of the USOC's hierarchy. 
</P>
<P>
	Last weekend, the USOC's executive committee adopted a  
preliminary report from a public-sector task force and from an 
independent consulting firm that is intended to put it more in line 
with how major corporations function as it heads into the 2000 
Olympics in Sydney. 
</P>
<P>
	A principal recommendation of the report, announced Monday,  
calls for creation of a professional staff position of president 
and chief executive officer to lead the USOC, a job that would 
replace the current executive director. The report also would 
change the role and definition of the USOC's volunteer president, 
making it a new position of chairman of the board. 
</P>
<P>
	Schultz lauded the recommendations but said at a news conference  
that he would not seek the new position of president/CEO. He said 
it would require a longer commitment than he is prepared to make. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked if he was invited to apply for the new position, Schultz  
said, ``I certainly had the option of applying. But as it was laid 
out by McKinsey &AMP; Co. and the public-sector group, this is going to 
be a three- to five-year commitment. I'm not ready to commit that 
kind of time. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm going to be 70 years old here in another week. I've been  
in this business 49 years. I've hardly had any weekends off. I have 
grandchildren I haven't seen. For me to think about going another 
three to five years after Sydney is just not appealing to me at 
all.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Schultz ran into trouble shortly after Bill Hybl became USOC  
president in 1996, with growing concerns that his low-key style was 
resulting in a lack of leadership. Those troubles escalated this 
spring, when Hybl and other members of a volunteer board of 
directors were caught flat-footed when John Krimsky resigned as 
deputy executive director and marketing chief. 
</P>
<P>
	Hybl will assume the job of chairman. His current job is limited  
to one four-year term expiring at the end of 2000, but there 
apparently would be no limit on his tenure as chairman. 
</P>
<P>
	While a search begins for a new president-CEO, Schultz will  
devote more time to fund-raising, particularly for the 2002 Winter 
Games in Salt Lake City. 
</P>
<P>
	Schultz, formerly executive director of the NCAA, said  
fund-raising efforts are improving after being disrupted by the 
Olympic bribery scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm going to be spending a lot of my time doing that in the  
next 12 to 14 months,'' he said. ``I will stay on until the job is 
finished, through 2000. If we have a shortfall or something and 
it's important for me to continue to be involved after that, I'll 
be willing to do that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asked how long he will continue as executive director, Schultz  
said, ``I can't answer that. We're going to make sure it's a smooth 
transition. It depends on how fast the search committee can do its 
work and how quickly the board of directors will approve the 
constitution and bylaws changes. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're probably looking at five to six months minimum, but  
hopefully it will be quicker than that. 
</P>
<P>
	``While I do have a contract through 2002, my commitment to the  
USOC was to go to 2000 and then I would make a decision. If I'm 
happy and healthy, I'll go on through Salt Lake and that's the end. 
The way I feel right now, at the end of the Sydney Games in 2000, 
that's enough.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said he will receive no severance package. ``I'm just going  
to serve out my term,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hybl insisted that the executive committee has been ``very  
pleased with many of the things that have gone on'' under Schultz's 
tenure. 
</P>
<P>
	``The decision was Dick's,'' Hybl said. ``Even after there is a  
new president and CEO, Dick will be involved with fund-raising in 
the most significant way. The executive committee has confidence in 
Dick, and we've asked him to be part of the search process.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The completed report of the recommended restructuring will be  
presented to the USOC board of directors, which meets Oct. 23-24. 
Formal approval will be sought at a subsequent special meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	``The earliest it could be done is probably late January,'' Hybl  
said. ``We will announce within a week or so the search committee. 
It is our intention to expedite this process so the president and 
CEO will have some time with Dick and also more time before the 
Sydney Games.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Michael McManus Jr., chairman of the USOC Public Sector task  
force, said his report ``was not about people and was never 
intended to be about people. Unfortunately, that was written (in 
the media). That's not what we were trying to do. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our conclusion and the McKinsey conclusion is that the USOC,  
which has gotten so big, needs to be run like a corporation, so you 
have a chairman who has a vision and a president-CEO who will carry 
out those policies on a day-to-day basis.''

<HEADLINE> Detroit Teachers Call a Strike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- One day before the start of classes, Detroit's  
teachers Monday refused a contract extension and called a strike, 
despite a state law barring them from walking out. 
</P>
<P>
	The strike vote was a setback for a bold attempt to reform the  
school system and improve Detroit's struggling schools. 
</P>
<P>
	The talks are the first contract negotiations with the teachers  
since Detroit's elective school board was replaced earlier this 
year with one appointed by Mayor Dennis Archer. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would have to say the rejection today does reflect an  
unwillingness by some teachers to engage themselves in significant 
change,'' said David Adamany, the interim chief executive of the 
172,000-student district. 
</P>
<P>
	The previous contract between the Detroit Federation of Teachers  
and the school system expired June 30, and an extension ran out on 
Monday. Talks are scheduled to resume Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	School and union negotiators had agreed early Monday on a new,  
10-day extension while talks continued. However, thousands of 
teachers took a vote later in the day, rejected the extension and 
called a strike. 
</P>
<P>
	Adamany said students should not go to school Tuesday, and said  
classes will not be held until officials know that enough teachers 
will report for work. 
</P>
<P>
	The union has not walked out since 1992. Under a 1994 Michigan  
law, public school employees who strike lose a day's pay in 
addition to being fined a day's pay. The law has never been tested. 
</P>
<P>
	Union president John Elliot said he was disappointed with the  
vote, and said he had recommended the 10-day extension. 
</P>
<P>
	Adamany said the school district will not seek a court  
injunction to try to force the teachers back to work. 
</P>
<P>
	The issues still unresolved included salary increases, merit  
pay, extended work days and a dress code. Teachers said merit pay 
was the most contentious issue. Many prefer to keep the old 
standards of experience, seniority and education. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't understand merit pay. I think it needs a lot of  
explanation,'' said Jennifer Poole, 52, a school social worker with 
more than 12 years' experience. 
</P>
<P>
	Among those opposing the new extension was Anita Griggs, 40, who  
has taught elementary classes at Stell Wagen Academy for 15 years. 
</P>
<P>
	``Once they get us in the classrooms, there's no reason to  
bargain in good faith. They've got the labor,'' Ms. Griggs said. 
</P>
<P>
	The mayor said in a statement that he is troubled by the strike  
vote after all of the hard work the district had done to prepare 
for the school year. 
</P>
<P>
	The appointed school board -- an idea pushed by Republican Gov.  
John Engler and approved by the Legislature -- followed decades of 
declining performance and alleged mismanagement and pork-barrel 
politics in Detroit schools. Supporters said an appointed school 
board would be better able to make the hard political decisions 
that need to be made.

<HEADLINE> Prevention Said Key in Handling HIV </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- With life-prolonging drugs proving to be  
successful in reducing the number of AIDS-related deaths, more 
efforts to control the epidemic should be directed toward 
prevention, health officials say. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 2,000 scientists, doctors, researchers and advocates  
are in Atlanta this week for the National HIV Prevention Conference 
-- the first national conference addressing efforts to monitor and 
prevent the spread of HIV, the virus that causes AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have demonstrated that prevention works and deserves  
support,'' said Dr. Jeffrey Koplan, head of the Centers for Disease 
Control and Prevention. ``Nevertheless, as in most areas of public 
health, support for prevention is frequently more rhetorical than 
substantive.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The latest national data on trends in HIV infections and AIDS  
deaths were expected to be released today. Also, researchers will 
release the results of studies using a new antibody test that 
allows scientists to measure the time of new HIV infections with 
much greater precision. 
</P>
<P>
	Since the 1980s, more than 300,000 have died of AIDS. The good  
news is that the number of new HIV infections has dropped from 
about 100,000 a year to 40,000. However, federal health officials 
warned Sunday about a growing complacency about HIV, especially 
among some people most at risk. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's becoming increasingly difficult to get people to pay  
attention to HIV prevention and that in and of itself is a primary 
reason for this conference,'' said Dr. Helene Gayle, director of 
the CDC's National Center for HIV, STD, and TB Prevention. 
</P>
<P>
	``Despite a growing complacency about the need for HIV  
prevention, HIV remains a serious disease that is still very much 
with us and there is a greater need for HIV prevention today more 
than ever,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	The conference, which ends Wednesday, also will examine the  
disproportionate effect the epidemic is having on women and 
minorities, especially blacks who are becoming infected with AIDS 
at record rates. 
</P>
<P>
	In the mid 1980s, blacks represented about 25 percent of the new  
cases of AIDS reported, Hispanics about 14 percent and women 8 
percent, U.S. Surgeon General David Satcher said. By 1997-98, 
blacks made up 45 percent of the cases, Hispanics 22 percent and 
women 23 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	``One of the major concerns we have about the AIDS epidemic is  
that increasingly it is affecting communities that tend to be left 
out of the health care and public health system,'' Satcher said. 
``We know that in order to be successful we have to find a new way 
to reach these communities.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The conference was organized by the CDC and other sponsoring  
organizations.

<HEADLINE> Teen Pentagon Hacker Charged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GREEN BAY, Wis. (AP) -- A teen-ager described as the founder of a  
hacker group called ``Global Hell'' was charged Monday with 
illegally gaining access to a Pentagon computer. 
</P>
<P>
	The Justice Department announced that Chad Davis, 19, of Green  
Bay, was arrested and charged in a federal complaint with hacking 
into the U.S. Army computer and maliciously interfering with the 
communications system. 
</P>
<P>
	The complaint said he gained illegal access to an Army Web page

	NEW YORK (AP) -- Edward Burns, best known for writing and  
starring in films about guys and girls, is working on a script 
about cops and criminals. 
</P>
<P>
	And Burns didn't have to look too far for advice. His father,  
Edward Burns Sr., is a retired police sergeant. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was a cop for 28 years in New York, so he's giving me notes

	The writer-director-actor, who gained fame in ``The Brothers  
McMullen,'' ``She's the One'' and Steven Spielberg's ``Saving 
Private Ryan,'' will submit his new script to DreamWorks in 
September. ``On the Job'' is about two generations of 
Irish-American policemen.

<HEADLINE> The Kid's in the Title Picture </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SARATOGA SPRINGS, N.Y. (AP) -- Jose Santos knew the final result  
of the Travers as Lemon Drop Kid carried him into the final turn. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had the race won since the half-mile pole,'' the jockey  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	It wasn't until just inside the sixteenth pole that Lemon Drop  
Kid got ahead of Vision and Verse and beat him to the wire by 
three-quarters of a length Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Santos' second win in a $1 million Grade I stakes on Lemon Drop  
Kid -- he beat Vision and Verse by a nose in the Belmont Stakes -- 
put Lemon Drop Kid into the Horse of the Year picture. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's shown he should be one of the top 3-year-olds,'' Santos  
said after Lemon Drop Kid beat seven rivals, including favored 
Menifee, third another 1 3/4 lengths back, at the end of the 1 1/4 miles. 
</P>
<P>
	Scotty Schulhofer, Lemon Drop Kid's 73-year-old Hall of Fame  
trainer, isn't claiming any honors yet for the colt. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's got a lot to do yet,'' Scotty Schulhofer said. ``He's  
going to have to beat Behrens and some older horses to get Horse of 
the Year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As for now, however, Lemon Drop Kid is a serious contender for  
the 3-year-old title. Still in the hunt for that championship is 
Charismatic, the Kentucky Derby-Preakness winner, who was retired 
after being injured while finishing third in the 1 1/2-mile Belmont on 
June 5. 
</P>
<P>
	Lemon Drop Kid will run next in the 1 1/4-mile Jockey Club Gold Cup  
on Oct. at Belmont Park, then in the 1 1/4-mile Breeders' Cup Classic 
on Nov. 6 at Gulfstream Park. Both Grade I stakes are 
weight-for-age races. 
</P>
<P>
	He probably would meet the 5-year-old Behrens, leader of the  
handicap division, in the Gold Cup and the Classic. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is an improving horse, and I'm not sure where we'll go  
next,'' said Bill Mott, trainer of Vision and Verse. Mott's 
Unbridled Jet finished last. 
</P>
<P>
	Trainer Elliott Walden said he didn't know what Menifee's next  
race would be, but co-owner James Stone of New Orleans indicated he 
would like to see the colt start in the 1 1/4-mile Super Derby on Oct. 
2 at Louisiana Downs. 
</P>
<P>
	The stretch-running Menifee was trapped on the rail by Unbridled  
Jet in the run down the backstretch. The Derby-Preakness runnerup's 
chances also were compromised by a slow pace. The fractions were 24 
seconds for the quarter, 48 1/4 for the half and 1:12 2-5 for 
three-quarters. Lemon Drop Kid's winning time was 2:02 under scale 
weight of 126 pounds on a fast track. 
</P>
<P>
	Three of Lemon Drop Kid's five wins in 13 career starts have  
been in Grade I stakes -- he won Belmont's Futurity last year -- and 
he also has three seconds and two thirds. The $600,000 winner's 
purse boosted his earnings to $1.541,470. He paid a winning mutuel 
of $9.30. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hope he gets a little credit now,'' Santos said. ``He had to  
prove he was the real thing. I have to give all the credit to 
Scotty Schulhofer. He's done a wonderful job with this horse. He 
told me he had the horse 110 percent, and he was right.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Schulhofer decided not to push Lemon Drop Kid because he was a  
May foal. When he finished ninth in the Kentucky Derby, it was only 
his third start of the year. The colt was held out of the 
Preakness, then won the Belmont and finished second in the Jim 
Dandy on Aug. 8 at Saratoga on a sloppy track, a surface he did not 
like, before winning the Travers. 
</P>
<P>
	Ecton Park, the Jim Dandy winner and Menifee's stablemate,  
finished fourth in the Travers and was followed by Best of Luck, 
Badger Gold, Cat Thief and Unbridled Jet.

	Stocks End Lower; Dow Down 176.04  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks fell sharply today as bond yields rose  
and investors, seeking clues to the future course of interest 
rates, braced for another round of economic data. The Dow Jones 
industrial average closed down 176.04 at 10,914.13. The Dow has 
fallen more than 100 points in each of the last three sessions. 
Broader stock indicators also fell. But trading volume was very 
light, which tends to exaggerate price moves. The Nasdaq composite 
index fell 46.20 to 2,712.70. Investors remained nervous about 
interest rates as they awaited reports this week on manufacturing 
activity and unemployment, which are expected to offer some 
evidence of how fast the U.S. economy is growing, and whether 
inflation is escalating.

	New Home Sales Rise in July  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- New home sales rose a tiny 0.1 percent in July  
but still managed to post the second-highest level ever, a sign 
that the housing sector continues to thrive despite rising mortgage 
rates. The Commerce Department reported today that sales were up in 
all parts of the country in July except for the West. The Northeast 
led way with a 33.9 percent increase. Low unemployment and higher 
wages and benefits are helping sales, but economists also suggest 
that some people are jumping off the fence to lock in a deal now 
before mortgage rates climb further. They figure they can refinance 
their homes if rates fall.

	European Stocks Lower Overall

<P>
	LONDON (AP) --Plans for a major French supermarket merger pushed  
the European retail sector higher, but shares overall were lower 
today. The Dow Jones Stoxx Index of 592 European companies closed 
down 0.4 point at 314.57, while the Dow Jones Euro Stoxx Index, 
which tracks 297 companies in countries joining the single 
currency, ended down 0.6 point at 329.34. France's CAC-40 index of 
most actively traded French stocks rose 0.3 percent. The Dow Jones 
Euro Stoxx 50 Index finished down 15.7 points at 3,837.8, while the 
DJ Stoxx 50 Index closed down 14.1 points at 3,775.5. Among 
domestic markets, Frankfurt's Xetra Dax closed down 27.83 points, 
or 0.5 percent, at 5,392.53, while Amsterdam's AEX ended down 0.53 
points at 584.36 points. London's market was closed for a bank

	French Retailers Plan Merger  
</P>
<P>
	PARIS (AP) -- French supermarket group Carrefour said today it  
was acquiring rival Promodes in a deal that would create the 
world's second-largest retailer and a European challenge to 
Wal-Mart Stores Inc. The friendly stock deal valued at about $16.3 
billion was expected to prompt similar mergers across Europe, where 
retailers are scrambling to find partners as Wal-Mart seeks to 
expand on the Continent. The combined operation will have a market 
capitalization of about $49 billion and annual sales of nearly $50 
billion. But it will still be much smaller than Wal-Mart, which had 
sales of $138 billion in 1998 and is expected to easily surpass 
that figure this year.

	AT&AMP;T Cuts Long-Distance Rates

	NEW YORK (AP) -- AT&AMP;T Corp. today took steps to meet a price war

prices for long-distance phone calls to 7 cents a minute and 
simplifying rates. The rate is still higher than offers introduced 
early this month from MCI WorldCom and Sprint. The new AT&AMP;T rate is 
good for calls made any time. Customers who want the rate also must 
pay the company a fee of $5.95 a month. AT&AMP;T had charged 15 cents a 
minute around the clock with no monthly fee or 10 cents a minute 
with a $4.95 fee.

	Russia Sets Economic Growth Goal  
</P>
<P>
	MOSCOW (AP) -- The Russian government is aiming for 5 percent  
average annual economic growth over the next eight to 10 years, the 
Economics Ministry said in a report released today. The report, 
carried by the ITAR-Tass news agency, gave no details on how the 
government plans to achieve that somewhat optimistic goal. Russia's 
economy has contracted for each of the past 10 years with the 
exception of 1997, when it grew by 0.4 percent. The economy is 
forecast to contract by 2 percent this year.

banks, a senior IMF official said today, noting the organization 
has already put tight controls in place to prevent such illegal 
actions. The comments by Tom Dawson, director of external affairs 
at the international lending agency, followed a statement by the 
Chairman Jim Leach, R-Iowa, of the House Banking Committee. He said 
that IMF loans to Russia should be halted until controls are put in 
place to prevent diversions of the sort that reportedly occurred 
through Bank of New York.

assembly lines last month, compared with 920,776 a year ago, the

mechanism. The recall includes 270,000 VW Passats and 158,000 Audi 
A4, A6 and A8 cars, said VW spokesman Jens Bobsien. VW is sending 
letters to car owners instructing them to go to their dealer or

<HEADLINE> Jump in Prescription Sales Expected </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Americans are delving deeper than ever into  
their medicine chests, with nearly 3 billion prescriptions expected 
to be filled this year, according to a pharmacy trade group. 
</P>
<P>
	Consumers will buy an estimated 2.97 billion prescriptions this  
year, 9 percent more than the 2.73 billion they picked up last 
year, the National Association of Chain Drug Stores said in a 
report issued Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Prescription sales could jump to 4 billion before 2005, said  
Robert W. Hannan, the group's interim president and chief 
executive. 
</P>
<P>
	Pharmacists, drug makers and consumer groups attribute the rise  
to an aging population, increased advertising and an expanding 
array of medicines that target ``lifestyle'' ailments such as 
insomnia. 
</P>
<P>
	Among new drugs sold this year are American Home Products'  
Sonata sleeping pill, a Glaxo Wellcome influenza fighter called 
Relenza, the Hoffman La Roche fat-blocker Xenical, and Plan B, a 
``morning-after'' anti-pregancy pill to be distributed by the 
Women's Capital Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	Chain pharmacies account for 63 percent of prescription drug  
sales in dollar terms -- a projected $76.6 billion this year. 
Prescription drugs also are sold at nursing homes, hospitals, 
prisons and via mail order. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've been absolutely deluged,'' said Lowell McNichol, who  
mans the Safeway drug counter in Petaluma, Calif. ``We have drugs 
available now for things we couldn't treat five, 10, 15 years ago. 
So we use them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Among the fastest-selling new drugs are so-called cox-2  
inhibitors, a new class of painkillers often referred to as 
``super-aspirins.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Antidepressants are among the top-selling drugs, with 17 percent  
more prescriptions this June than in June 1998, according to NDC 
Health Information Services, which tracks drug sales. Nearly one of 
every three anti-depressants sold is Eli Lilly &AMP; Co.'s Prozac, one 
of the oldest drugs of its class. 
</P>
<P>
	The increase in prescriptions continues a long-term trend.  
Americans bought 2 billion prescriptions in 1992 and 2.6 billion in 
1997, an increase of about 30 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	But Americans spent 64 percent more on drugs in 1997 than in  
1993, according to IMS Health, a Plymouth Meeting, Pa.-based 
industry research company that helped formulate the 1999 estimates.

<HEADLINE> NC State Victory Stuns Texas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUSTIN, Texas (AP) -- Texas can forget about replacing Ricky  
Williams. The Longhorns have to worry about finding punt 
protection. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite a dominating defensive performance that held North  
Carolina State to 172 yards and one offensive score, Texas gave up 
a school-record three blocked punts that led to 16 points in the 
Wolfpack's 23-20 victory Saturday night in the Black Coaches 
Association Classic. 
</P>
<P>
	NC State returned two fourth-quarter blocks by freshman Terrence  
Holt for touchdowns. The Wolfpack could have scored another TD on a 
first-quarter block but three players couldn't pick up the ball 
before it rolled out of the back of the end zone for a safety. 
</P>
<P>
	The Longhorns were ranked 17th in the preseason Top 25 but  
dropped out Sunday night, replaced by North Carolina State, which 
moved into the rankings at No. 24. 
</P>
<P>
	Changes will be made on Texas' punt team, which had too many  
inexperienced players, coach Mack Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've got reevaluate what we're doing there and how not to put  
those young guys in those tough spots,'' Brown said. ``We felt like 
we could block one of their punts. We didn't and they did.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brown thought he solved one problem during the game. Figuring  
junior offensive lineman and long-snapper Marcel Blanchard was 
tiring, Brown replaced him with freshman Hunter McWilliams after 
the second block. McWilliams snapped the ball well on the final 
block but the protection broke down. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's something Stanford will try to exploit next weekend,''  
Brown said. ``We'll probably be nervous about it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A season-opening loss was not what the Texas faithful had  
envisioned after a resurgent 9-3 campaign in 1998. More than 80,000 
packed Royal-Memorial Stadium to watch the continued rebirth of 
their once-dormant program. 
</P>
<P>
	They were stunned when Holt, younger brother of former Wolfpack  
All-America wideout Torry Holt, recorded his second block. Eric 
Leak picked up the loose ball and returned it for the winning 
touchdown with 3:22 to play. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a devastating loss for our kids and our fans and I hate  
it,'' Brown said. ``Thank goodness it's the first game and not the 
last.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For North Carolina State, it was the third early season upset in  
as many years with victories over Syracuse in 1997 and Florida 
State last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Wolfpack players ran onto the field in celebration at the final  
gun. The victory left coach Mike O'Cain beaming about his team's 
rise from consecutive 3-8 seasons in 1995 and 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were almost run out of Raleigh three years ago, and now we  
beat Texas on national TV,'' O'Cain said. 
</P>
<P>
	Offensively, the Wolfpack struggled. After giving up 99 yards in  
the first quarter, Texas' defense clamped down on the NC State 
running backs and quarterback Jamie Barnette. 
</P>
<P>
	The ACC's total offense leader in 1998, Barnette was 9-of-26 for  
65 yards with one interception. It was his worst outing as a 
starter as the offense totaled just seven first downs.. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm so grateful we won. So grateful,'' Barnette said. ``We  
can't play any worse that this on offense, and we still win the 
game.''

	Natural gas and gasoline futures also rose. In other markets,  
coffee futures plummeted to a five-and-a-half-year low. 
</P>
<P>
	Crude and its products advanced sharply after Venezuela, Mexico  
and Saudi Arabia announced over the weekend after a meeting of 
their oil ministers in Caracas that production cuts aimed at 
lowering supplies and raising prices will be kept in place through 
March. 
</P>
<P>
	The three countries agreed to a first round of cuts in March  
1998 and a second round last March. 
</P>
<P>
	The market had been watching the Caracas meeting closely for any  
hint that production would be boosted at next month's meeting of 
the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries in Vienna. 
Venezuela and Saudi Arabia are OPEC members. 
</P>
<P>
	The price jump for oil futures was the third in a row after the  
market was jolted last Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Also contributing to Monday's rally was the impact of three  
refinery shutdowns in recent days that raised concern about fuel 
supply. 
</P>
<P>
	Louisiana officials confirmed Monday that Chalmette Refining, a  
70,000-barrel-a-day joint venture, will be shut down for as long as 
two and a half weeks after unexpected problems closed it on 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Phillips Petroleum shut a refinery that produces low-sulfur  
diesel and kerosene fuels the same day. 
</P>
<P>
	On Saturday, a fire closed down a 75,000-barrel-a-day Sunoco  
refinery in Toledo, Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
	Bob Morris, an analyst for Paine Webber, said the natural gas  
rise came in response to the runup in crude futures. 
</P>
<P>
	Natural gas for October delivery rose 4.7 cents to $2.969 per  
each 1,000 cubic feet. 
</P>
<P>
	October crude rose 74 cents to $22.01 a barrel; September  
heating oil rose 1.34 cents to 57.33 cents a gallon; September 
unleaded gas rose 2.71 cents to 68.82 cents a gallon. 
</P>
<P>
	Coffee prices sank as investors reacted to ample supplies on the  
market, with Brazil's harvest winding down after suffering little 
frost damage and truck strikes in Brazil and Colombia this week 
causing no impact. 
</P>
<P>
	Brazil's harvest has been aided by recent dry weather, and  
analysts say the next crop is expected to be significantly larger. 
Rain also has boosted prospects for the fall harvest in Colombia.

<HEADLINE> Japan's Industrial Output Slips </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Japanese industrial production fell 0.6 percent in  
July from the month before, the Ministry of International Trade and 
Industry announced Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Economists surveyed by Dow Jones Newswires had projected on  
average that industrial production would be up 0.2 percent from 
June. 
</P>
<P>
	The industrial production figure is calculated after adjustment  
for seasonal factors. 
</P>
<P>
	MITI also said that it expects production in August and  
September to show increases. 
</P>
<P>
	Output will surge 4.7 percent in August from July on an  
anticipated increase in the shipping of electronic machinery, 
Ministry official Naoki Nakajima said. 
</P>
<P>
	The ministry expects output to increase 0.2 percent in  
September, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Japan has been fighting its worst economic downturn in more than  
50 years. But some bright signs have appeared recently, most 
notably a 2.0 percent increase in gross domestic product for the 
first quarter of this year.

<HEADLINE> Umpires Sue Baseball Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Umpires once again sued baseball in federal  
court, asking today for an injunction to keep 22 umps working 
beyond Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Major League Umpires Association, claiming 22 of its members  
are being terminated against their will, filed a grievance against 
the American and National leagues late Friday, then went to court 
in Philadelphia this morning, saying they would be irreparably 
harmed. 
</P>
<P>
	Baseball claims the umpires aren't being fired, but that it  
accepted the resignations of the 22. 
</P>
<P>
	Umpires, fearful that baseball would lock them out after their  
labor contract expires Dec. 31, announced July 14 they would quit 
en masse to try to force an early start to negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
	But the strategy backfired when 27 of the 68 umpires either  
refused to resign or withdrew their resignations. Baseball then 
hired 25 new umpires from the minors and accepted 22 resignations, 
effective Sept. 2. 
</P>
<P>
	Umpires now claim they never intended to quit and the  
resignations were merely symbolic. 
</P>
<P>
	They sued baseball July 26, but withdrew the case Aug. 16 just  
before the leagues were to file a motion to dismiss. Baseball says 
all of the matters are covered by either binding arbitration or the 
National Labor Relations Board. 
</P>
<P>
	Umpires filed unfair labor practice charges with the NLRB's New  
York regional office Aug. 3, asking the agency to issue a complaint 
and to seek an injunction stopping baseball from terminating the 
22. The NLRB has not yet ruled on the charges.

<HEADLINE> Bonds Give Back Some Gains / Bonds  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Bond prices fell for a third straight session  
Monday, sending yields back over 6 percent, as a report about 
strong housing sales fanned inflation fears. 
</P>
<P>
	The price of the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond fell 1 3/32  
point, or $10.93 3/4 per $1,000 in face value. Its yield, which moves 
in the opposite direction, rose to 6.05 percent from 5.97 percent 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Commerce Department reported Monday that new home sales rose  
to their second highest level on record in July. New home sales 
climbed 0.1 percent in July to an annual rate of 980,000, second 
only to November 1998's blistering annual pace of 985,000. That was 
faster than economists had forecast. 
</P>
<P>
	The strong demand for housing shows consumer spending still at a  
fast pace, which worries traders because it might cause the Federal 
Reserve to increase interest rates for a third time this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Bond prices had soared in the past week on expectations that the  
Federal Reserve would let interest rates stabilize for the rest of 
this year. But on Thursday, after the Fed had raised short-term 
rates to rein in inflation, bond traders began to re-evaluate 
whether yields had fallen too fast. 
</P>
<P>
	Higher interest rates push down prices for bonds, which pay a  
fixed rate of return. 
</P>
<P>
	In the broader market, prices of short-term Treasury securities  
fell 1/8 point to 5/32 point, and intermediate maturities fell 12/32 
point to 11/16 point, reported Bridge Telerate, a financial 
information service. 
</P>
<P>
	Yields on three-month Treasury bills were 4.98 percent as the  
discount rose 0.01 percentage point to 4.85 percent. Six-month 
yields were 5.18 percent, as the discount rose 0.08 percentage 
point to 4.98 percent. One-year yields were 5.28 percent as the 
discount rose 0.04 percentage point from late Friday to 5.01 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Yields are the interest bonds pay by maturity, while the  
discount is the interest at which they are sold. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between  
banks, rose to 5.31 1/4 percent from 5.25 percent late Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively  
traded municipal bonds fell 5/16 point to 114 16/32. The average 
yield to maturity rose to 5.77 percent, up from 5.75 percent late 
Friday.

	E. Timorese Vote on Independence  
</P>
<P>
	DILI, Indonesia (AP) -- Throngs of eager East Timorese were  
waiting outside polling stations when they opened today to vote on 
whether their troubled territory should become independent. Despite 
months of concern that people might be too afraid to vote in the 
U.N.-sponsored referendum, long lines formed peacefully outside 
polling centers in the territorial capital, Dili. The historic 
referendum was the first time East Timor's people have had a direct 
say in how their homeland should be governed after almost four 
centuries of Portuguese colonial rule and 24 years of iron-fisted 
Indonesian occupation.

	BRIDGEHAMPTON, N.Y. (AP) -- President Clinton wound up a New York  
weekend devoted to fund raising for Democrats with a plug for one 
Democrat in particular -- his wife. ``Of all the people I have ever 
known in public life, the ablest, the smartest, the most 
passionately dedicated and committed, is the person who wants to be 
the next United States senator from New York,'' Clinton said at a 
fund-raising dinner last night on Long Island. Officially, Hillary 
Rodham Clinton is only exploring a run in New York in 2000, but the 
president's words were just one clue that she intends to go ahead

<P>
	ATLANTIC BEACH, N.C. (AP) -- The punch-packing heart of Hurricane  
Dennis continued to track parallel to the Carolina coast today, 
while its edge brought pelting rain, strong winds and the threat of 
beachfront flooding. Forecasters expected the storm to turn 
northeast away from land, but the possibility of a full-force 
landfall in North Carolina remained. Even if Dennis' eye remains 
offshore, they said, the storm's strong winds could cause problems 
for coastal residents. A hurricane warning was in effect for much 
of the North Carolina coast, and a smattering of residents sought 
refuge in shelters in several coastal counties.

<HEADLINE> Dairy Farmers OK Pricing System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Dairy farmers have overwhelmingly approved a  
plan by the Agriculture Department to soften regional disparities 
in the way milk is priced, although many producers are looking to 
Congress to rewrite the proposal before it takes effect. 
</P>
<P>
	USDA has not released the results of a referendum on the plan,  
but a senator who has seen them said Monday that it was approved by 
97 percent of the producers who voted nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
	Although it would hurt many farmers outside the upper Midwest,  
the plan was expected to be approved because milk prices would 
otherwise be deregulated as of Oct. 1. The vote was conducted Aug. 
2-6. 
</P>
<P>
	``The reforms are not all that we had hoped, but they push our  
national dairy policy in the right direction,'' said Sen. Herbert 
Kohl, D-Wis. 
</P>
<P>
	Chris Galen, a spokesman for the National Milk Producers  
Federation, said ``the referendum was a choice between the lesser 
of two evils. The most egregious evil is having no federal order 
program. ... It's no surprise that dairy producers very grudgingly 
and with a great deal of reservation did vote in the USDA 
proposal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His group estimated that producers would lose $200 million a  
year under the new system. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the current system, guaranteed minimum prices for fluid  
milk are lowest in the upper Midwest and highest in the South and 
West, up to $3 per hundred pounds higher in some places, because 
the price is based on a farm's distance from Eau Claire, Wis. The 
Depression-era system was designed to spur production in areas 
where it had been scarce. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1996, Congress scheduled the system for elimination and  
ordered USDA to come up with a new plan. 
</P>
<P>
	The House Agriculture Committee voted 32-15 earlier this month  
to block the USDA plan and implement an alternative proposal that 
is closer to the current pricing system. The legislation is 
sponsored by more than 220 lawmakers, a majority of the House. 
</P>
<P>
	In a letter to USDA, the largest dairy cooperative in the  
nation, Dairy Farmers of America, said its members were approving 
the pricing plan reluctantly. ``Our 'yes' vote does not mean that 
dairy farmers can live with the final rule. They cannot! 
Economically, the income and livelihood of many dairy farm families 
will suffer significantly under your proposal,'' the group said. 
</P>
<P>
	USDA officials declined to comment Monday on the referendum. The  
results were to be released officially Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> Draper Plays Open With Heavy Heart </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Last month, Scott Draper's wife lost a long  
battle with cystic fibrosis. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, the Australian kept his date at the U.S. Open and was  
beaten in the first round by Paul Goldstein 6-3, 6-1, 6-0. 
</P>
<P>
	``Believe me, I didn't want to come,'' Draper said. ``My heart  
didn't want to come. I didn't want to come here. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think that you can't walk away. You're not going to get  
anywhere in life just walking away from things. I like to think 
that anything that comes along in life for me, I can handle. I 
think that was a decision that did it. 
</P>
<P>
	``I needed to come over here for many reasons. I just did it;  
got on the plane, came over, sorted out things, see people, play 
tennis. That may help me in the long run.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Draper's courage was inspiring to Goldstein.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's really difficult circumstances,'' he said. ``It's a match  
that difficult to go into. It's a match you play with a heavy heart 
because you feel for Scotty because he's really one of the most 
well-liked and well-respected people on tour as an individual. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have a lot of compassion. You admire someone for going out  
there in those circumstances and competing the way he did. For him 
to step out there on the court and play the entire match, you have 
a great deal of respect for him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Goldstein lost just one game over the last two sets but it still  
was a difficult match for the 23-year-old from Stanford. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've never experienced this before,'' he said, ``to feel for  
someone that bad. Usually, you have an opponent on the other side 
of the net, you're ready to stick a serve down his throat or 
something. That certainly wasn't the way I felt today.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kellie Draper was already sick when she and Scott married on  
Dec. 5, 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	``You say for better or for worse, you're marrying the person,''  
he said. ``Whatever they bring with them, that's just it, they 
bring it with them into the marriage. Whatever problems she's got, 
I've got to deal with. They've got to deal with my problems. It's 
the person you're marrying, the person you love. I think the 
quality of time you spend with somebody is more important than 
anything else. She was still the same person, regardless of 
whatever problems she had.

<HEADLINE> Survey Eyes Youth Substance Abuse </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Most teen-agers find it easier to talk about  
drugs with their mothers than with their fathers, and those who 
don't get along with their fathers are at far greater risk of 
smoking, drinking and using drugs, a survey found. 
</P>
<P>
	Teens in two-parent families who have fair or poor relationships  
with their fathers are 68 percent more likely to use drugs than 
those in the average two-parent household that was surveyed, said a 
report issued Monday by the private National Center on Addiction 
and Substance Abuse at Columbia University. 
</P>
<P>
	By comparison, children raised by their mothers alone were only  
30 percent more likely to use drugs than those living in the 
average two-parent home. 
</P>
<P>
	``Too many fathers are just AWOL in their kids lives,'' Joseph  
Califano, the research center's chairman, told a news conference. 
``They're not there to help with homework and kids don't go to them 
with important problems.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some 2,000 youths ages 12 to 17 and 1,000 parents were surveyed  
by telephone in May and June. Researchers assessed the teens' risk 
of drug use by asking, among other things, if they had friends who 
use drugs and if they thought they would use drugs themselves in 
the future. 
</P>
<P>
	Mothers influence their children's important decisions three  
times as often as fathers and are more likely to have private talks 
about drugs, the study found. Fifty-eight percent of teens said 
they had very good or excellent relationships with their fathers, 
compared with 70 percent with their mothers. 
</P>
<P>
	Fifty-seven percent said it was easier to talk to their mothers  
about drugs; 26 percent preferred talking to their fathers. The 
remaining 17 percent said they did not know. 
</P>
<P>
	It has been difficult to encourage fathers to be close to their  
children because ``fatherhood has not been culturally valued,'' 
said Don Eberly, chairman of the National Fatherhood Initiative, a 
private support group for fathers. 
</P>
<P>
	``It matters a lot more that the father not only be present but  
emotionally engaged, that the father is investing his life in his 
children, that he knows his children, that he's a friend to his 
children,'' Eberly said. 
</P>
<P>
	Califano said fathers should ask themselves if they join with  
mothers in monitoring their teen's conduct. And he said they should 
also ask, ``How often do I eat meals with my children?'' 
</P>
<P>
	The study found that children who never have dinner with their  
parents have a 70 percent greater risk of substance abuse. 
</P>
<P>
	Parents should take the survey results as a ``back-to-school''  
reminder to support their children and ask them questions, said Dr. 
H. Westley Clark, director of the Center for Substance Abuse 
Treatment at the Department of Health and Human Services. 
</P>
<P>
	``Too often, people think of the parenting role as the mother's  
job, and this reminds us that the family is the children, the 
mother and the father where possible,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Speaking to children about drugs should start early because  
``the opportunity for parents to impact their teen's thinking about 
illegal drugs diminishes as the teen gets older,'' the survey's 
authors said. They found that 34 percent of 12-year-olds reported 
excellent relationships with their parents, but that plummets to 14 
percent by the time the teens turn 17. 
</P>
<P>
	Supporting recent studies that overall youth substance abuse has  
leveled off, the survey found that 40 percent of teens said the 
drug situation at school is getting worse, down from 55 percent in 
1998. And more teens, 60 percent, said they don't expect to use a 
drug in the future, an increase of 9 percentage points since 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Parents were more pessimistic, with 45 percent thinking their  
children will someday use drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	This ``parental resignation often reflects their own drug-using  
behavior,'' said Califano, a former secretary of health, education 
and welfare. Of those parents who had tried marijuana, 58 percent 
thought their kids would try it as well. 
</P>
<P>
	The anonymous survey also found that teens who said their  
fathers have more than two drinks a day have a 71 percent greater 
risk of substance abuse. 
</P>
<P>
	The survey also found:  
</P>
<P>
	--Nearly 90 percent of teens said they felt safe in school.  
</P>
<P>
	--More than half said they attended a school where drugs were  
used and 20 percent said that if they wanted to buy marijuana, they 
could get it in less than a half-hour. 
</P>
<P>
	--Almost half of teens who had never used marijuana credited  
their parents with their decision. 
</P>
<P>
	For the teen portion of the survey, the margin of error was plus  
or minus about 2 percentage points; for the parents, plus or minus 
about 3 percentage points.

<HEADLINE> New Test Flags Early HIV Infections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- A new AIDS test that can tell when infections are  
less than six months old is giving health officials a new tool to 
track the spread of the disease. 
</P>
<P>
	Research presented Monday at the first national conference on  
AIDS prevention used the blood tests to show that new infections 
are continuing at a steady rate, as researchers previously 
estimated. 
</P>
<P>
	Though standard blood tests show whether a person is infected  
with HIV, the virus that causes AIDS, they do not tell if infection 
occurred recently or a long time ago. That's made it hard for 
scientists to say with certainty from year-to-year whether new 
infections are increasing, declining or staying the same. 
</P>
<P>
	The new test, developed by the Centers for Disease Control and  
Prevention along with other organizations, can identify infections 
as four-to-six months old using the same blood samples as the 
standard tests. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's the first time we have had timely HIV incidence data on a  
broad scale,'' said Dr. Robert Janssen, one of the CDC AIDS 
researchers who helped develop the test. 
</P>
<P>
	It's still too early to tell if the test will have significant  
medical impacts by catching early infections, Janssen said. But he 
said it should help newly infected patients identify sexual 
partners who either may have infected them or contracted the virus 
from the patient after he was infected. 
</P>
<P>
	The CDC has been using the new blood test for only about the  
last two months, Janssen said. 
</P>
<P>
	Using the new blood test to study 96,000 people visiting STD  
clinics in six cities between 1991 and 1997, the CDC found ``no 
apparent increases or decreases in the rate of new infections'' in 
either homosexuals or heterosexuals, said Dr. Hillard Weinstock, a 
CDC researcher.

<HEADLINE> China OKs Tax on Savings Interest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BEIJING (AP) -- China's legislature approved a tax on savings  
account interest Monday, trying to boost a slowing economy by 
encouraging consumers to save less and spend more. 
</P>
<P>
	The tax, meant to reduce the incentive to save, adds to a string  
of increasingly desperate economic measures. Slack consumer demand 
has led to a 22-month-long slide in prices that officials are 
afraid could bankrupt Chinese companies. 
</P>
<P>
	Retail sales are largely unchanged despite repeated cuts in  
interest rates and billions of dollars injected into the economy 
through public works projects. Savings rates are among the highest 
in the world at 40 percent of household income. 
</P>
<P>
	Economic growth has slowed considerably, falling to 7.1 percent  
in the second quarter of the year from 8.3 percent in the first 
three months. 
</P>
<P>
	The new tax is to be imposed on both Chinese- and  
foreign-currency accounts, the official Xinhua News Agency said. It 
did not say when the tax would be imposed or give the rate. 
</P>
<P>
	Savings accounts earned about $25 billion in interest last year,  
according to Xinhua. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenue from the new tax will be used for unemployment benefits,  
welfare payments and pensions, Finance Minister Xiang Huaicheng was 
quoted as saying. 
</P>
<P>
	Also Monday, the legislature approved raising the national debt  
by $7.3 billion through the sale of treasury bonds to fund state 
spending to stimulate growth. 
</P>
<P>
	Half the money will go to the central government and half will  
be lent to local governments, Xinhua said. The money will be spent 
on infrastructure construction, technological innovation and 
environmental protection projects. 
</P>
<P>
	State spending was a key factor in China's strong economic  
growth late last year after the government issued a special $12.1 
billion infrastructure bond and pushed state banks to increase 
their lending by the same amount. 
</P>
<P>
	However, growth in state spending has fallen sharply this year.  
Fixed-asset investment rose by just 3.8 percent year-on-year in 
July, down from 22.7 percent growth in the first quarter of this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	The government is increasing payments to laid-off workers, pay  
for civil servants and export tax rebates as part of its strategy 
to jump-start economic growth.

<HEADLINE> CD-ROM Can Help With Digital Camera </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Digital cameras are becoming commonplace, but that doesn't mean  
getting the right one for your needs is necessarily easy -- or 
cheap. 
</P>
<P>
	That's because selecting a digital camera requires many choices  
on issues most of us don't know exist, let alone understand. If you 
think megapixel is Tinkerbell on steroids and that interpolation is 
a couple of residents shaking hands in Warsaw, Poland, you'll 
probably need a little help in your shopping. 
</P>
<P>
	John Stewart, a mellow-voiced technical audiobook guru from  
Spring Grove, Minn., has a new CD-ROM title that can help. It's 
called ``How To Buy Your First Digital Camera.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stewart has been doing this sort of thing since 1991, when he  
made his first audiobook, ``The DOS Tape,'' and his efforts since 
have been consistently good, taking complex technology and making 
it understandable. 
</P>
<P>
	``How To Buy Your First Digital Camera'' is divided into five  
chapters that help you assess your needs, grasp basic concepts, 
choose the best camera configuration, review storage options, and 
understand accessories and power sources. He also deals with image 
editors and includes two freeware image editing programs. 
</P>
<P>
	The image editing programs are especially handy, since they  
often can fix whatever composition or lighting mistakes you made 
when you took the digital picture. One of the programs is 
``Irfanview,'' written by Irfan Skiljan, a student at Vienna 
University of Technology in Austria. You can crop and enhance 
images, and add text and special effects. 
</P>
<P>
	The other program is Ultimate Paint from MegaLux, a Hungarian  
company. It's a paint-draw program with some built-in photo 
processing functions. 
</P>
<P>
	The CD-ROM uses whatever Internet browser you have and offers  
you the option of either reading the text or listening to Stewart. 
Both MP3 and Real Audio formats are supported. Other than Windows 
95 or better, the only other requirement is a 24-speed CD-ROM 
drive. (Anything slower and the audio will be a bit choppy, 
although you could work around that by copying the audio files to 
your hard drive.) 
</P>
<P>
	Stewart also wins points by shipping the CD-ROM in a plain  
cardboard mailer. He calls his company Audio Computer Information, 
Inc., and a flier explains the lack of fancy packaging: ``At ACI, 
we think our customers know that using a 'king-sized cereal box'' 
to hold one disk and a sheet of paper is silly. We prefer to leave 
untapped all the natural resources required to make that box.'' 
Amen. 
</P>
<P>
	``How To Buy Your First Digital Camera'' costs $24.95 including  
shipping. It's available at (800) 647-8273. The company's web site 
is www.acpress.com. 
</P>
<P>
	And, for the record, a pixel is a ``picture element,'' one of  
the small ``tiles'' that make up a digital picture. Megapixel 
indicates resolution of 1,280 x 960 pixels or more. Interpolation 
is the process of averaging pixel information when scaling an 
image.

<HEADLINE> Critics Accuse Turkish Government </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ISTANBUL, Turkey (AP) -- Critics are accusing the Turkish  
government of taking advantage of the chaos following the recent 
deadly earthquake to ram several controversial bills through 
parliament. 
</P>
<P>
	The bills included a partial amnesty for Kurdish rebels, an  
increase in the retirement age, and the pardoning of more than 
26,000 criminals. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a (government) raid on parliament,'' Yusuf Kanli, a  
commentator for the English-language Turkish Daily News said 
Sunday. ``They wanted to benefit from the quake.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Many of the bills were passed late at night by Prime Minister  
Bulent Ecevit's coalition, which has the support of 351 deputies in 
the 550-seat parliament. Parliament also strengthened the power of 
the government to deal with the earthquake before it went on summer 
recess until the beginning of October. 
</P>
<P>
	Ecevit plans to discuss possible U.S. aid to quake victims when  
he meets with President Clinton on Sept. 28, a U.S. official said 
today. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton already has said that he will do all he can to assist  
Turkey, a close U.S. ally. An official at the U.S. Embassy said a 
U.S. economic aid package was under consideration, but gave no 
details. The official spoke on customary condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, parliament's quick passage of several controversial  
laws sparked criticism from various quarters. 
</P>
<P>
	Yildirim Koc, a spokesman for Turkey's largest labor union,  
Turk-Is, said that if it weren't for the quake, there would have 
been ``widespread and intense'' protests to the law raising the 
retirement age. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this year, the proposal to lift the retirement age -- to  
60 from 50 for men and to 58 from 45 for women -- sparked weeks of 
protest and a general strike. But after the quake, union members 
had no time to mobilize because they were busy burying colleagues 
and friends. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill to pardon 26,000 criminals was passed Saturday morning  
after all-night discussions. It ostensibly aimed at alleviating the 
country's overcrowded jails. It also stiffened penalties for future 
offenders. But the pardon also included members of the police and 
civil services charged or convicted of torture and misuse of power 
before April 23, 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	The daily Radikal lashed out at that deal, saying the government  
``pardoned itself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Human rights groups have accused Turkish police of widespread  
torture and harassment of suspects. 
</P>
<P>
	The daily Evrensel said the pardon included five officers  
sentenced earlier this year to prison terms of 7 1/2 years in the 
beating death of one of their reporters -- Metin Goktepe -- while he 
was in police custody three years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Meeting at midnight last Thursday, parliament approved a  
``repentance law'' granting partial amnesty to members of the 
Kurdistan Workers Party, or PKK, which has waged a 15-year fight 
for autonomy in southeast Turkey that's killed 37,000 people. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposed law had been heavily criticized by nationalists  
opposed to granting any concessions to the rebels.

<HEADLINE> Survey Eyes Youth Substance Abuse </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Teen-agers who don't get along with their  
fathers in two-parent families are more likely to smoke, drink and 
use drugs than those raised by single mothers, according to a new 
survey that examines how different family types affect youth 
substance abuse. 
</P>
<P>
	Children raised by their mothers alone were 30 percent more  
likely to use drugs than those living in supportive two-parent 
homes. But those with two parents who have poor relationships with 
their fathers have a 68 percent greater risk, said a report today 
by the private National Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse at 
Columbia University. 
</P>
<P>
	``This should be a wake-up call for dads across America,''  
Joseph Califano, chairman of the center, said today. ``Every father 
should look in the mirror and ask: 'How often do I eat meals with 
my children? Take them to religious services? Help them with their 
homework?''' 
</P>
<P>
	In the telephone survey of 2,000 youths ages 12 to 17 and 1,000  
parents, more than twice as many teens said they found it easier to 
talk to their mothers than their fathers about drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers assessed teens' risk of drug use by asking questions  
including whether they had friends who use drugs and if they 
thought they would use drugs themselves in the future. The study 
found that 14 million teen-agers fell into the moderate- or 
high-risk groups. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 70 percent of the teens said they had very good or  
excellent relationships with their mothers, but only 58 percent 
said they got along as well with their fathers. 
</P>
<P>
	Mothers influence their children's important decisions three  
times as often as fathers and are more likely to have private talks 
about drugs, the study found. 
</P>
<P>
	``Too often, people think of the parenting role as the mother's  
job, and this reminds us that the family is the children, the 
mother and the father where possible,'' said Dr. H. Westley Clark, 
director of the Center for Substance Abuse Treatment at the 
Department of Health and Human Services. 
</P>
<P>
	Clark advised parents to take the survey results as a  
``back-to-school'' reminder. Parents should be supportive and ask 
questions instead of making accusations and giving orders, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Speaking to children about drugs should start early because  
``the opportunity for parents to impact their teen's thinking about 
illegal drugs diminishes as the teen gets older,'' the survey's 
authors said. They found that 34 percent of 12-year-olds reported 
excellent relationships with their parents, but that number 
plummets to just 14 percent by the time the children turn 17. 
</P>
<P>
	``Parent power may be the greatest underutilized resource in our  
nation's battle to give our children the will and skills to say no 
to drugs,'' said Califano, a former secretary of health, education 
and welfare. 
</P>
<P>
	Confirming recent studies that overall youth substance abuse has  
leveled off, the survey found that 40 percent of teens said the 
drug situation at school is getting worse, down from 55 percent in 
1998. And more teens, 60 percent, said they don't expect to use a 
drug in the future, an increase of 9 percentage points since 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Parents were more pessimistic, with 45 percent thinking their  
children will someday use drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	Califano said this ``parental resignation often reflects their  
own drug-using behavior'' and that of those parents who had tried 
marijuana themselves 58 percent and thought their kids would try as 
well. 
</P>
<P>
	The study also found that while the teen-agers said facing drugs  
was their most important problem, the parents ranked drugs second, 
after the social pressure of ``fitting in'' with their peers. 
</P>
<P>
	For the teen portion of the anonymous survey, the margin of  
error was plus or minus 2.2 percentage points, and for the parents, 
plus or minus 3.1 percentage points. 
</P>
<P>
	The survey also found:  
</P>
<P>
	--Teens who reported their fathers have more than two drinks a  
day have a 71 percent greater risk of substance abuse. 
</P>
<P>
	--Nearly 90 percent of teens said they felt safe in school.  
</P>

could get it in less than a half-hour.

<HEADLINE>  Dennis Dumps Rain on Carolina Coast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTIC BEACH, N.C. (AP) -- Hurricane Dennis brought pouring  
rain and wind gusting to 80 mph to the North Carolina coast today, 
knocking out power to thousands of customers as it skirted land, 
then began edging slowly away. 
</P>
<P>
	Meteorologists warned that the hurricane's strong wind still  
could cause more problems for coastal residents. 
</P>
<P>
	``(Dennis) has a very large eye, and the highest winds are well  
removed from the center,'' said Todd Kimberlain, a meteorologist 
with the National Hurricane Center in Miami. 
</P>
<P>
	Hurricane-force wind, of at least 74 mph, extended as much as 80  
miles out from the center, and tropical storm-force reached up to 
290 miles outward in places, the National Weather Service said. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the storm had turned slightly from its northeasterly  
heading onto an east-northeast track. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's a good sign. I'd rather have it going that way than the  
other,'' said Bill Frederick of the hurricane center. 
</P>
<P>
	Frederick said that over the next day Dennis is expected to  
accelerate as it heads out to sea, but then stall sometime Tuesday, 
a couple of hundred miles from the coast. At that time, it will 
continue to produce high seas and swells, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hurricane warnings were canceled this morning for the  
southernmost section of the North Carolina coast, a 66-mile stretch 
from Sunset Beach to Surf City, the weather service said. 
</P>
<P>
	A hurricane warning remained in effect for the rest of the North  
Carolina coast, including the Outer Banks, and a smattering of 
residents sought refuge in shelters in several coastal counties. 
Evacuation orders had been posted for some of the Outer Banks 
barrier islands, and the bridge linking Bogue Banks island with the 
mainland was closed today because of the rain and wind. 
</P>
<P>
	On the mainland, a head-on traffic accident blamed on the high  
wind and heavy rainfall killed two people today at the town of 
Richlands, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	Along the Outer Banks, waves crested Hatteras Island's dunes and  
washed onto N.C. Highway 12, threatening to cut the 60-mile-long 
barrier island's only link to Nags Head to the north. Sand blowing 
across the highway reduced visibility to just yards at times. 
</P>
<P>
	At 11 a.m., Dennis was centered 85 miles southeast of Cape  
Lookout and was moving toward the east-northeast at about 15 mph. 
Its maximum sustained wind was near 100 mph. 
</P>
<P>
	Gusts to 112 mph were reported early today at Frying Pan Shoals,  
about 25 miles off the coast south of Wilmington, the weather 
service said. 
</P>
<P>
	A tropical storm warning was in effect northward to the Maryland  
state line and a gale warning extended to Cape Henlopen, Del. 
</P>
<P>
	Rain fell at a rate of almost 3 inches an hour along the North  
Carolina coast and the weather service said 10 inches of rain was 
possible in some areas. There was also a chance of isolated 
tornadoes. 
</P>
<P>
	At daybreak, some low-lying streets on Atlantic Beach and  
parking lots on the mainland at Morehead City flooded, but no 
streets appeared to be impassable. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 50,000 customers were without power today from New  
Hanover County to as far west as Raleigh in the central part of the 
state, utilities reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Roughly 100 evacuees -- fewer than expected -- sought refuge  
Sunday night at a Red Cross shelter at a Wilmington school. ``It's 
just been a trickle,'' said shelter manager Judy Saunders. 
</P>
<P>
	On Sunday afternoon, Gov. Jim Hunt issued emergency and disaster  
decrees, allowing more resources to be devoted to the storm. 
Seymour Johnson Air Force Base sent aircraft to bases in Ohio as a 
precaution. 
</P>
<P>
	Vice President Al Gore and his family cut short their 12-day  
beach vacation on Figure Eight Island, said Tommy Taft, a 
Greenville attorney and family friend. 
</P>
<P>
	But in Atlantic Beach on Sunday, residents took the storm in  
stride. Few houses were boarded up, including those directly on the 
coast. Fire officials combed the beachfront, chasing away those who 
ignored posted warnings. 
</P>
<P>
	Just offshore, lone surfer Joey Gray rose and fell on surging  
swells. ``I think he's nuts,'' said fire department Lt. Phil 
Lawrence as he waited for Gray to come ashore. 
</P>
<P>
	Once on land, Gray was unfazed. ``I know it has a certain amount  
of risk,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Francis Vincent of Fenton, Mich. had planned to spend a few days  
in a rustic cabin on the nearby island of Camp Lookout. Instead, he 
planned to ride out the storm at a mainland hotel, and took along 
his gas grill, jugs of water and even an inflatable dinghy. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're set for no power,'' he joked. ``It can't be no worse  
than a tornado.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In South Carolina, Dennis had become more a nuisance than a  
threat as tourists left the coast in bumper-to-bumper traffic, but 
the rain also brought a measure of relief in a season of drought. 
Gov. Jim Hodges ordered the National Guard sent home today. 
</P>
<P>
	Farther south, the Florida coast returned to normal after a  
two-day brush with downpours and gusty wind from Dennis' outer edge 
as the storm rolled through the northern Bahamas. 
</P>
<P>
	At the Portside Galley Restaurant in Port Canaveral, Fla.,  
Christine DeSouza welcomed breakfast patrons with a new sign. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hello customers, bye Dennis,'' it read.

<HEADLINE> Stocks End Lower; Dow Down 176.04 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks fell sharply today as bond yields rose  
and investors, seeking clues to the future course of interest 
rates, braced for another round of economic data. 
</P>
<P>
	At the close of trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial  
average was down 176.04 at 10,914.13. The Dow has fallen more than 
100 points in each of the last three sessions. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators also fell. But trading volume was very  
light, which tends to exaggerate price moves. 
</P>
<P>
	Tthe Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 fell 24.25 to 1,324.02, and the  
Nasdaq composite index fell 46.20 to 2,712.70. 
</P>
<P>
	Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 5-to-2 margin on the  
New York Stock Exchange, with 2,151 down, 861 up and 517 unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
	NYSE volume totaled 595.57 million shares as of 4 p.m., vs.  
553.19 million in the previous session. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies fell 5.09 to 427.36.  
</P>
<P>
	Investors remained nervous about interest rates as they awaited  
reports this week on manufacturing activity and unemployment, which 
are expected to offer some evidence of how fast the U.S. economy is 
growing, and whether inflation is escalating. 
</P>
<P>
		   Analysts say signs of inflation could convince investors that  
the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates for a third time this 
year. The Fed raised rates in late June and last Tuesday, and 
stocks rose sharply on chairman Alan Greenspan's hint that the two 
rate increases might be enough to keep inflation at bay. 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, the Dow dropped 108 points after Greenspan suggested  
at a Fed conference that the central bank should consider the 
effects of the bull market while setting monetary policy. Greenspan 
also deemed the market's long rise ``inexplicable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``People have good reason to be concerned and cautious,'' said  
William Meehan, chief market analyst at Cantor Fitzgerald. ``If 
anyone had any doubts that Mr. Greenspan is still concerned about 
inflation, he put them to rest on Friday.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts say Greenspan has been distressed by the market's  
tendency to rise following interest rate increases. Generally, 
higher rates are bad for stocks because they can cut into corporate 
profits and make other investment vehicles more attractive. 
</P>
<P>
	Today, bonds proved more attractive, as prices dropped and the  
yield on the 30-year Treasury bond rose past 6 percent for the 
first time since Aug. 16. Analysts say yields above 6 percent draw 
investors away from stocks as they seek out guaranteed, stable 
returns. 
</P>
<P>
	Financial services stocks, which typically suffer when interest  
rates are high, fell today. American Express and J.P. Morgan were 
the weakest performers in the Dow. 
</P>
<P>
	Boeing rose after company officials and leaders of its largest  
union neared agreement on a three-year contract. If ratified, the 
contract would eliminate the threat of a strike that has hung over 
the company. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of Progressive Corp. plunged after the insurer said it  
will miss earnings expectations in the third quarter due to price 
cuts and changes in the auto industry. 
</P>
<P>
	While most companies are expected to continue a streak of strong  
profits in the third quarter, analysts say expectations -- and stock 
prices -- are so high that any company that misses published 
estimates is likely to see its share price tumble. 
</P>
<P>
	Internet shares, which were mostly higher last week, slipped  
back as investors locked in profits. Amazon.com fell, as did 
Bamboo.com, which made its initial public offering of stock last 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of long-distance telephone companies were mostly lower  
after industry leader AT&AMP;T said it will cut prices for 
long-distance phone calls to 7 cents a minute. Fears of price wars 
have been holding down share prices of many phone companies.

<HEADLINE> Dallas Owner Gets Misdemeanor Charge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HIGHLAND PARK, Texas (AP) -- Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones was  
charged Monday with a misdemeanor for driving away from police 
during a traffic stop. 
</P>
<P>
	Police considered charging Jones with fleeing the scene of a  
traffic stop, but decided on a charge of interference with public 
duties. 
</P>
<P>
	Both charges are Class B misdemeanors, carrying a maximum  
penalty of a $2,000 fine and-or 180 days in jail. 
</P>
<P>
	Dallas County assistant district attorney Wendy Risinger said  
Jones' case was to be assigned to a criminal court and that Jones 
would have to make a court appearance. 
</P>
<P>
	Cowboys spokesman Rich Dalrymple said Monday that neither Jones  
nor the team would comment further. Jones apologized in a statement 
Sunday night. 
</P>
<P>
	His brush with the law began Sunday morning as he and his family  
drove in two vehicles to Highland Park United Methodist Church for 
the baptism of Jones' grandson. 
</P>
<P>
	Police stopped one of the vehicles, a Suburban in which family  
members were riding, for going 45 mph in a 30 mph zone. The car 
carrying Jones also pulled over. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones asked the officer, who was questioning the driver of the  
other car, if he could drive the Suburban with his family members 
to the church because they were late. 
</P>
<P>
	Highland Park Director of Public Safety Darrell Fant said  
officer Jerry Remington told him to wait, adding, ``It will just be 
a minute. I'll do this as fast as I can.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fant said Jones took the car anyway. One of Jones' employees  
then drove away in the other car, leaving the Suburban driver -- an 
employee of Jones -- at the scene with Remington. 
</P>
<P>
	Fant said Jones clearly was agitated in his encounter with the  
officer, saying he had an emergency and asking to speak with a 
supervisor. A video camera mounted in the patrol car recorded the 
traffic stop, a key piece of evidence that won't be available to 
the public until the case is resolved. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was stressed because of his late schedule,'' Fant said.  
``If he'd given him (Remington) three or four minutes, it would 
have been done.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Another patrol car followed Jones to the church with lights  
flashing but Jones did not stop until he let family members out and 
then drove several blocks to a private driveway. 
</P>
<P>
	In Jones' statement Sunday, he said he didn't know police were  
following him until he arrived at the church. He said he drove away 
to avoid further traffic congestion and confusion. 
</P>
<P>
	``This matter occurred because of my very sincere effort to get  
all of my family to the christening of our grandson,'' Jones said. 
</P>
<P>
	Fant said Jones cooperated as he was handcuffed and arrested. He  
was booked into jail, arraigned on a misdemeanor charge and 
released about an hour later on his own recognizance. 
</P>
<P>
	The Suburban driver, James Gafford, was cited for speeding and  
failure to carry his driver's license. 
</P>
<P>
	Fant said the media coverage of Jones' arrest surprised him.  
</P>
<P>
	``This is a minor offense. It seems to have taken on a different  
perspective when the world media is trying to criticize what is 
good and what is bad.''

<HEADLINE> Remains of Hitler Aide Put to Sea </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) -- Genetic tests last year put to rest  
rumors that Hitler's secretary had escaped postwar Germany and was 
living in exile. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, German authorities have taken precautions to ensure that  
Martin Bormann's remains don't become the focal point of a memorial 
for neo-Nazis. 
</P>
<P>
	After consultations with the Bormann family, prosecutors ordered  
the remains cremated and committed to the Baltic Sea in an area 
outside territorial limits, a lawyer for the Bormann family said 
today. 
</P>
<P>
	``It must be guaranteed that no possibility exists around which  
to establish any sort of memorial,'' said Florian Besold, a Munich 
attorney. 
</P>
<P>
	Bormann's ashes were deposited at sea two weeks ago, after  
Frankfurt prosecutors ordered the skeletal remains cremated. 
</P>
<P>
	The handling of Bormann's remains is consistent with that of  
other deceased Nazis. The cremated remains of 10 Nazis executed on 
convictions at the Nuremberg trials were deposited into a stream 
near Munich, along with those of Luftwaffe chief Hermann Goering, 
who killed himself in Allied custody. 
</P>
<P>
	Some mystery remains in some cases, most notably that of Hitler.  
</P>
<P>
	Witnesses reporting Hilter's suicide in a Berlin bunker said his  
remains ``were wiped out by uninterrupted Russian artillery fire,'' 
William L. Shirer wrote in his book ``The Rise and Fall of the 
Third Reich.'' 
</P>
<P>
	However, Russian television claimed in 1993 that pieces of  
Hitler's skull had been kept for years in state archives. 
</P>
<P>
	Half a century after the Nazi defeat, German authorities contend  
with annual attempts by neo-Nazis to rally at the grave site of 
Rudolf Hess, Hitler's deputy, on the anniversary of his death and 
birth. 
</P>
<P>
	Hess hanged himself on Aug. 17, 1987, in Berlin's Spandau  
prison, where for 21 years he was the lone inmate. The prison had 
become a site of neo-Nazi pilgrimage during Hess's imprisonment, 
and the four Allied powers, which then still technically governed 
the city, decided to demolish the structure after his death. 
</P>
<P>
	Bormann's remains were discovered in 1972 at a construction  
site. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite expert opinion that the remains were those of Bormann,  
rumors persisted that he had escaped and he was alive. 
</P>
<P>
	But DNA tests proved conclusively that the bones were those of  
Bormann, and that he died May 2, 1945 as the Soviet army invaded. 
</P>
<P>
	Bormann was later, in 1946, tried in absentia and sentenced to  
death for war crimes by the military tribunal in Nuremberg.

<HEADLINE>  Dennis Dumps Rain on Carolina Coast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTIC BEACH, N.C. (AP) -- Hurricane Dennis brought pouring  
rain and wind gusting to 80 mph to the North Carolina coast today, 
knocking out power to thousands of customers as it skirted land, 
then began edging slowly away. 
</P>
<P>
	Meteorologists warned that the hurricane's strong wind still  
could cause more problems for coastal residents. 
</P>
<P>
	``(Dennis) has a very large eye, and the highest winds are well  
removed from the center,'' said Todd Kimberlain, a meteorologist 
with the National Hurricane Center in Miami. 
</P>
<P>
	Hurricane-force wind, of at least 74 mph, extended as much as 80  
miles out from the center, and tropical storm-force reached up to 
290 miles outward in places, the National Weather Service said. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the storm had turned slightly from its northeasterly  
heading onto an east-northeast track. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's a good sign. I'd rather have it going that way than the  
other,'' said Bill Frederick of the hurricane center. 
</P>
<P>
	Frederick said that over the next day Dennis is expected to  
accelerate as it heads out to sea, but then stall sometime Tuesday, 
a couple of hundred miles from the coast. At that time, it will 
continue to produce high seas and swells, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hurricane warnings were canceled this morning for the  
southernmost section of the North Carolina coast, a 66-mile stretch 
from Sunset Beach to Surf City, the weather service said. 
</P>
<P>
	A hurricane warning remained in effect for the rest of the North  
Carolina coast, including the Outer Banks, and a smattering of 
residents sought refuge in shelters in several coastal counties. 
Evacuation orders had been posted for some of the Outer Banks 
barrier islands, and the bridge linking Bogue Banks island with the 
mainland was closed today because of the rain and wind. 
</P>
<P>
	On the mainland, a head-on traffic accident blamed on the high  
wind and heavy rainfall killed two people today at the town of 
Richlands, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	Along the Outer Banks, waves crested Hatteras Island's dunes and  
washed onto N.C. Highway 12, threatening to cut the 60-mile-long 
barrier island's only link to Nags Head to the north. Sand blowing 
across the highway reduced visibility to just yards at times. 
</P>
<P>
	At 11 a.m., Dennis was centered 85 miles southeast of Cape  
Lookout and was moving toward the east-northeast at about 15 mph. 
Its maximum sustained wind was near 100 mph. 
</P>
<P>
	Gusts to 112 mph were reported early today at Frying Pan Shoals,  
about 25 miles off the coast south of Wilmington, the weather 
service said. 
</P>
<P>
	A tropical storm warning was in effect northward to the Maryland  
state line and a gale warning extended to Cape Henlopen, Del. 
</P>
<P>
	Rain fell at a rate of almost 3 inches an hour along the North  
Carolina coast and the weather service said 10 inches of rain was 
possible in some areas. There was also a chance of isolated 
tornadoes. 
</P>
<P>
	At daybreak, some low-lying streets on Atlantic Beach and  
parking lots on the mainland at Morehead City flooded, but no 
streets appeared to be impassable. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 50,000 customers were without power today from New  
Hanover County to as far west as Raleigh in the central part of the 
state, utilities reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Roughly 100 evacuees -- fewer than expected -- sought refuge  
Sunday night at a Red Cross shelter at a Wilmington school. ``It's 
just been a trickle,'' said shelter manager Judy Saunders. 
</P>
<P>
	On Sunday afternoon, Gov. Jim Hunt issued emergency and disaster  
decrees, allowing more resources to be devoted to the storm. 
Seymour Johnson Air Force Base sent aircraft to bases in Ohio as a 
precaution. 
</P>
<P>
	Vice President Al Gore and his family cut short their 12-day  
beach vacation on Figure Eight Island, said Tommy Taft, a 
Greenville attorney and family friend. 
</P>
<P>
	But in Atlantic Beach on Sunday, residents took the storm in  
stride. Few houses were boarded up, including those directly on the 
coast. Fire officials combed the beachfront, chasing away those who 
ignored posted warnings. 
</P>
<P>
	Just offshore, lone surfer Joey Gray rose and fell on surging  
swells. ``I think he's nuts,'' said fire department Lt. Phil 
Lawrence as he waited for Gray to come ashore. 
</P>
<P>
	Once on land, Gray was unfazed. ``I know it has a certain amount  
of risk,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Francis Vincent of Fenton, Mich. had planned to spend a few days  
in a rustic cabin on the nearby island of Camp Lookout. Instead, he 
planned to ride out the storm at a mainland hotel, and took along 
his gas grill, jugs of water and even an inflatable dinghy. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're set for no power,'' he joked. ``It can't be no worse  
than a tornado.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In South Carolina, Dennis had become more a nuisance than a  
threat as tourists left the coast in bumper-to-bumper traffic, but 
the rain also brought a measure of relief in a season of drought. 
Gov. Jim Hodges ordered the National Guard sent home today. 
</P>
<P>
	Farther south, the Florida coast returned to normal after a  
two-day brush with downpours and gusty wind from Dennis' outer edge 
as the storm rolled through the northern Bahamas. 
</P>
<P>
	At the Portside Galley Restaurant in Port Canaveral, Fla.,  
Christine DeSouza welcomed breakfast patrons with a new sign. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hello customers, bye Dennis,'' it read.

<HEADLINE> Soybeans, Wheat Down; Corn Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Soybean futures edged lower Monday on the Chicago  
Board of Trade after a weekend of favorable growing weather for 
crops in the key Midwest growing region. Grain futures were mixed. 
</P>
<P>
	The dip in soybeans prices was limited. Investors anticipated  
that the U.S. Department of Agriculture's weekly crop report, due 
out later Monday, would retain the good to excellent rating for 
this year's soybean crop. 
</P>
<P>
	Corn prices were slightly higher, driven by a technical rally,  
investors said. Analysts say corn prices should stay fairly steady 
as traders await crop estimates from the U.S. Department of 
Agriculture. Crops will be harvested in the next few weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat prices fell, pressured from low export demand.  
</P>
<P>
	Wheat for December delivery fell 3 cents to $2.59 3/4 a bushel;  
December corn rose 1 1/2 cents to $2.16 3/4 a bushel; December oats rose 
1/2 cent to $1.14 1/2 a bushel; November soybeans fell 1/4 cent to $4.70 1/2 
a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
	Beef and pork prices were higher on the Chicago Mercantile  
Exchange.

	October live cattle rose .35 cent to 66.85 cents a pound;  
October feeder cattle rose .13 cent to 79.05 cents a pound; October

<HEADLINE> New Home Sales Rise in July </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- New home sales rose a tiny 0.1 percent in July  
but still managed to post the second-highest level ever, a sign 
that the housing sector continues to thrive despite rising mortgage 
rates. 
</P>
<P>
	The Commerce Department reported today that sales of new  
single-family homes increased to a seasonally adjusted annual rate 
of 980,000 units last month -- up from 979,000 units in June. 
</P>
<P>
	July's rate was the highest since 985,000 new homes were sold in  
November 1998. Many analysts had expected higher mortgage rates to 
cut into sales. Some predicted 905,000 units would be sold. 
</P>
<P>
	``My reaction was, 'Wow!''' said Ken Mayland, chief economist  
for KeyCorp. ``One of the reasons the housing industry continues to 
outperform expectations is that stock market gains are continuing 
to burn a hole in the pockets of prospective home buyers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Low unemployment and higher wages and benefits are helping  
sales, but economists said other factors are at work. Some people, 
for instance, are jumping off the fence to lock in a deal now 
before mortgage rates climb further. They figure they can refinance 
their homes if rates fall. 
</P>
<P>
	Thirty-year fixed-rate mortgages averaged 7.63 percent in July,  
up from 7.55 percent in June and 6.95 percent in July 1998. In 
August, the rate hit 8.15 percent, the high for the year so far. 
</P>
<P>
	But the report Monday and one last week showing a 3.9 percent  
drop in existing home sales in July suggested that rising mortgage 
rates are starting to restrain sales, economists said. 
</P>
<P>
	``You are really beginning to see rising rates dampen people's  
appetites to buy a home,'' said David Lereah, chief economist for 
the Mortgage Bankers Association of America. A 1 percentage point 
rate increase means an estimated 400,000 families won't buy a home, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Separately, a Federal Reserve survey of U.S. banks, released  
Monday, showed that demand for home mortgages had decreased in 
recent months while demand for other consumer loans held steady. 
</P>
<P>
	The housing industry is heading for another year of record sales  
in 1999. This year home sales -- both existing and new -- are 
expected to total more than 6 million units, said James F. Smith, 
chief economist for the National Association of Realtors. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, the Federal Reserve bumped up interest rates by a  
quarter of a point, making borrowing more expensive. 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, the Fed signaled additional rate increases may  
not be needed this year unless the economy shows signs of 
overheating or inflation flares. But economists were split over 
whether the report would raise concerns at the Fed. 
</P>
<P>
	For new home sales, the 0.1 percent July gain followed a hefty  
7.3 percent increase in June, much better than the 3.1 percent gain 
the government previously estimated. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales were up in all parts of the country in July except for the  
West. The Northeast led by the way, with a 33.9 percent increase to 
an annual rate of 83,000 units. The Midwest posted a 9.9 percent 
gain to 178,000 units. Sales rose 0.2 percent in the South to a 
record 470,000 units, but fell 12.9 percent in the West to 249,000 
units. 
</P>
<P>
	The median price for a new home in July was $156,000, up from  
$155,000 in June. The median means half sold for more and half for 
less. 
</P>
<P>
	The increase in sales meant that it would take 3.8 months to  
exhaust the existing supply of unsold homes at the July sales pace. 
That was the same unsold inventory as in June.

<HEADLINE> Mets' Alfonso Hits Three Homers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- Edgardo Alfonzo hit three homers for the New York  
Mets on Monday night against the Houston Astros. 
</P>
<P>
	Alfonzo became the sixth Mets player to accomplish the feat --  
all on the road -- with a solo homer off Shane Reynolds in the 
first, a two-run shot off Brian Williams in the fourth and a 
leadoff homer in the sixth off Sean Bergman. 
</P>
<P>
	The second baseman also singled and scored a run in the second.  
</P>
<P>
	Alfonzo's 23 home runs are a Mets record for a second baseman in  
a season, surpassing Jeff Kent who hit 21 in 1993.

<HEADLINE> Gore Chides Gays in Military Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Vice President Al Gore criticized the Clinton  
administration's policy toward gays in the military and said he 
would implement ``don't ask, don't tell'' with more compassion. 
</P>
<P>
	In an interview published in the September editions of The  
Advocate, due on newsstands Tuesday, the vice president also 
asserted that adoption agencies -- not federal or state governments 
-- should decide on a case-by-case basis whether gays and lesbians 
should adopt children or serve as foster parents. 
</P>
<P>
	``Local adoption officials can evaluate the circumstances of the  
child and the parenting ability of prospective parents and decide 
if there's a good match,'' Gore said. 
</P>
<P>
	The vice president, who is on vacation with his family this  
week, was interviewed in June as he campaigned in California for 
the Democratic presidential nomination. His comments came before 
the much-publicized, Aug. 13 announcement by the Pentagon of new, 
mandatory training on anti-harassment guidelines for all troops. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, 1,145 people were discharged from the armed forces  
for homosexuality, the Pentagon reported. In 1997, the total was 
997, the highest number since 1987. The number of discharges hit a 
low of 617 in 1994, the year that President Clinton effected his 
``don't ask, don't tell'' policy, which allows gays to serve in the 
military as long as their sexual orientation is not discovered. 
</P>
<P>
	``The statistics may be reflecting some phenomenon I don't  
understand, but the easiest explanation is that it's not being 
implemented in a way that fully reflects the spirit of the 
policy,'' Gore told The Advocate. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would implement the policy with more compassion,'' Gore  
said. He added that he would work with military leaders on 
developing ``an implementation strategy that's fairer,'' but did 
offer specifics. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked if gays and lesbians were, by their nature, antithetical  
to ``family values,'' the vice president replied: ``I believe that 
God makes us in different ways. I don't believe that having made 
us, God intends us to suffer discrimination and prejudice.''

<TEXT>
<P>
	ROSEMONT, Ill. (AP) -- First lady Hillary Rodham Clinton helped  
open a conference aimed at ending domestic violence with a 
videotaped message to more than 2,000 advocates, researchers and 
battered women. 
</P>
<P>
	``Citizens and governments around the world will recognize that  
domestic violence is not a custom, it is a crime,'' Mrs. Clinton 
said in the videotaped message. 
</P>
<P>
	The four-day Next Millennium Conference, organized by the  
Justice Department and the Department of Health and Human Services, 
convened Sunday at a hotel near O'Hare International Airport. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'd like to see the next millennium be completely free of  
violence against women,'' said Deputy Assistant Secretary for 
Health Wanda Jones. 
</P>
<P>
	From 1992 to 1996, 21 percent of violence against women was  
initiated by a partner, according to a study by the Justice 
Department. In the same four-year period, 2 percent of violence 
against men was from domestic situations, the study said. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials scheduled to speak at the conference include U.S.  
Secretary of Health and Human Services Donna Shalala and U.S. Rep. 
Maxine Waters, D-Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	Resources for victims of domestic abuse include a national  
domestic violence hotline at 1-800-799-SAFE where battered women 
can talk to counselors. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials say this number can be used by women too scared to  
tell a friend or family member, who might tell the batterer and 
make the situation worse. 
</P>
<P>
	Victims of domestic abuse also are attending the conference.  
</P>
<P>
	Anna Belle Burleson of Austin, Texas, said she spent 10 years in  
an abusive marriage before getting a divorce. 
</P>
<P>
	``I finally left the relationship the night I looked death in  
the face,'' Ms. Burleson said. ``The last time I was assaulted it 
was very severe and I realized that if I did not get out of this 
relationship, I was going to be murdered.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Since the experience, Ms. Burleson has helped arrange retreats  
for women recovering from domestic violence.

<HEADLINE> How JoePa Spent His Summer? </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Anybody who knows how Joe Paterno spent his summer should not  
have been surprised by Penn State beating Arizona 41-7. 
</P>
<P>
	Paterno is scary good at his job every weekend, but even better  
with extra time to prepare. Penn State is 19-9-1 in bowl games 
during his tenure, but that mark pales alongside the 28-5 record in 
openers the Nittany Lions carried into Saturday's matchup with the 
Wildcats. 
</P>
<P>
	Making matters worse for Arizona, Paterno was cooped up at home  
for long stretches this summer while his wife, Sue, recuperated 
from a broken hip. After watching Penn State alternate 
quarterbacks, run reverses and open up the offense in ways his 
detractors dared him to, it's obvious JoePa didn't spend his days 
padding back and forth to the refrigerator. 
</P>
<P>
	He was watching film, tearing through sketch pads and plotting  
what to do with last year's backup passer, junior Rashard Casey, 
whose athletic ability intrigued Paterno as much as his 
unpredictability scared him. And at age 73, this old dog proved 
capable of learning some new tricks. 
</P>
<P>
	Arizona took its No. 3 ranking to Happy Valley, Pa., expecting a  
great defense and found one -- ``We've volunteered for a dangerous 
mission,'' Wildcat coach Dick Tomey said coming in. ``Most of our 
guys have never been east of Denver.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So imagine Tomey's shock when No. 4 Penn State came out Saturday  
playing like one of those pass-happy Pac-10 teams he sees all the 
time on the other side of the Rockies. 
</P>
<P>
	Ohio State coach John Cooper doesn't have to imagine.  
</P>
<P>
	``Now I know how Dick Tomey felt yesterday,'' Cooper said after  
his ninth-ranked Buckeyes got beat 23-12 by 12th-ranked Miami. ``I 
feel the same way today.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The words ``gambling'' and ``college football'' should be used  
in the same sentence with the great caution, but they belong 
together anytime Top 25 teams agree to play each other before Labor 
Day. 
</P>
<P>
	Cooper, like Tomey, took a big risk, and both took a big fall.  
While Penn State climbed to No. 2 with the win, Arizona slid all 
the way to No. 15. Miami moved up to eighth, while Ohio State 
slipped to No. 12. 
</P>
<P>
	But both losing coaches should be praised more than punished in  
the long run. Paterno admitted he probably wouldn't have taken 
Arizona on in the opener if the game was scheduled for Tucson. And 
Hurricanes coach Butch Davis, in the midst of a rebuilding effort 
to put Miami back in the national championship mix, had precious 
little to lose. 
</P>
<P>
	What both losing coaches will count on now is the short memories  
of poll voters. Last season, Arizona lost a shootout to UCLA late 
in the Pac-10 race, and with it, a shot at the Rose Bowl. Ohio 
State lost to Michigan State the first weekend of November and 
didn't have enough time to recover. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you're going to lose, you better lose early,'' Cooper said.  
``Then you better win the rest of your games then hope that you get 
some help from some other teams.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Florida State coach Bobby Bowden, whose Seminoles were the No. 1  
preseason pick, got some help from other teams, but not the way he 
planned. His team was scheduled to open against Auburn. But after 
the school fired Bowden's son, Terry, as coach in midseason, Auburn 
paid $500,000 to buy out of a two-year, home-and-home deal with the 
Seminoles rather than face Bowden's wrath. 
</P>
<P>
	Louisiana Tech was a last-minute substitute, but for a while,  
the Bulldogs looked like anything but stand-ins. The score was tied 
at 7-7 late in the half, and it wasn't until Heisman Trophy 
candidate Peter Warrick took off on an electrifying stop-and-go 
20-yard touchdown that the Seminoles took control en route to a 
41-7 win. 
</P>
<P>
	All the maneuvering over the weekend left the two old guys,  
Bowden, 69, and Paterno, perched at the top of what is supposed to 
be a young man's game. Both are in their 33rd season of coaching, 
and while we're used to seeing the two close friends arm-wrestling 
each other for career achievement marks -- bowl victories, most wins 
by active Division I-A coaches -- this could be the year they do it 
face-to-face for a national championship. 
</P>
<P>
	Sure, it's early, but you underestimate the fire still burning  
in both men at your own risk. Last month, Penn State's 
All-Everything linebacker LaVar Arrington told Sports Illustrated 
that the magazine was right to rank his team No. 1. ``We're going 
to whip up on some people,'' Arrington said. 
</P>
<P>
	When those words got back to Paterno, he reminded Arrington that  
talking was easy. It's backing it up that's hard. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's never been part of a national championship team and he  
doesn't know how to get there,'' Paterno said. ``Maybe he needs 
some of the older people who have been there to show him the way.'' 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Cigarette Packs To Jump 22 Cents </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RICHMOND, Va. (AP) -- The country's leading cigarette  
manufacturers have raised wholesale prices 18 cents a pack, 
anticipating an upcoming excise tax increase and higher costs 
stemming from their $206 billion settlement with the states over 
health care costs. 
</P>
<P>
	After markups, the move is likely to increase retail prices by  
about 22 cents per pack, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
	Philip Morris USA, the world's biggest tobacco maker, initiated  
the increase last Friday, which was matched by competitors. The 
increase was expected but came earlier than some analysts had 
predicted. 
</P>
<P>
	Retail prices are likely to increase immediately in some  
outlets, such as newsstands, where cigarettes are generally sold 
per pack. Increases may take longer at tobacco-only stores, said 
Morgan Stanley Dean Witter analyst David Adelman. 
</P>
<P>
	Spokesmen at Philip Morris, Brown &AMP; Williamson Tobacco Corp.,  
and R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Holdings Inc. all confirmed the increase 
Monday but refused to comment further. A spokesman at Lorillard 
Tobacco Co. did not immediately return phone calls. 
</P>
<P>
	Cigarettes currently cost between $2.50-$3.25 a pack, depending  
on the region of the country. 
</P>
<P>
	The price increase announced Friday to wholesalers is the second  
largest in industry history, behind a 45-cent increase last 
November. That increase followed a $206 billion settlement with 46 
states suing the industry to recover costs of treating ill smokers. 
The industry previously settled for $40 billion with the four other 
states. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, the industry faces further cost increases, including a  
10-cent increase in the federal excise tax set for Jan. 1, and an 
increase in settlement expenses from about 46 cents per pack to 
about 50 cents, Adelman said. 
</P>
<P>
	The remaining 4 cents of the price increase amount to a real  
increase in cigarette prices, or the amount the industry would 
normally have raised prices, Adelman said. 
</P>
<P>
	Roy Bury, an analyst at Brown Brothers Harriman, said experience  
with past price hikes indicates this increase of about 8 percent is 
likely to decrease demand by only about 2 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	``It clearly shows that the industry has the ability to offset  
higher costs with higher prices,'' Bury said. ``The key factor here 
is that profit per unit for domestic tobacco continues to go up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The increase will have a significant impact on demand, Adelman  
said, but overall revenues will still increase. 
</P>
<P>
	``The industry has got to balance not only volume but  
profitability,'' Adelman said. ``The fact is this industry is more 
profitable when it has moderate price increases.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ann Gurkin, an analyst at Davenport &AMP; Co., said she did not  
expect further price increases this year. But increases in future 
years are likely, Adelman said. 
</P>
<P>
	The industry's obligations under the settlement will increase  
again in 2001 from 50 cents per pack to 58 cents per pack, before 
decreasing in the following years, Adelman said. A further 5 cent 
increase in the federal excise tax is slated for Jan. 1, 2002, and 
state excise taxes may also rise in the coming years. 
</P>
<P>
	Adelman said cigarette prices have risen 28 percent this year  
and predicted increases of 9 percent next year, 6 percent in 2001, 
and 5 percent in 2002.

<HEADLINE> Washington Hostess Dies at 77 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Joan R. Braden, a hostess to and confidante of  
Washington's political heavyweights and senior government officials 
for more than three decades, died of a heart attack Monday. She was 
77. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Braden performed those roles even as she reared eight  
children, a story her husband, columnist Tom Braden, chronicled in 
the book ``Eight is Enough,'' which later became an ABC television 
series from 1977 to 1981. 
</P>
<P>
	In her varied career, Mrs. Braden served as a State Department  
officer, public relations executive, magazine writer, television 
interviewer and aide to John F. Kennedy and Nelson A. Rockefeller. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Braden, a native of Indianapolis, graduated from high  
school in Washington and from Northwestern university. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides her husband, she leaves seven children and 12  
grandchildren. The eighth child, Tom, died in 1994.

<HEADLINE> Army May Change 'Dated' Ad Campaign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Army is wondering whether its ``Be all  
that you can be'' ad campaign might be less than it should be, 
given a falloff in enlistments. 
</P>
<P>
	It's been rated one of the most popular jingles of the century,  
but with a new century approaching, the military's largest branch 
is looking for new ways to fill its depleted ranks. 
</P>
<P>
	The slogan has ``tremendous value because it is recognizable and  
part of the military culture,'' Army Secretary Louis Caldera told 
The Associated Press on Monday. ``The question is whether it is the 
right slogan for today's 18-to-24-year-olds,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	It's already less prominent in Army ads, coming only as words at  
the end of more fast-paced MTV-style ads rather than as part of the 
storyline, he said. While the Army may retain the slogan, future 
ads may appeal to the patriotic spirit of young people as well as 
the opportunities for self-improvement, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Doug Smith, spokesman for the Army Recruiting Command at Fort  
Knox in Kentucky, said the ad campaign is getting a ``thorough 
relooking.'' Smith stressed that no decision has been made on 
whether the slogan will be kept. 
</P>
<P>
	Abandoning the slogan, introduced in 1981, wouldn't be easy  
because it has been so successfully identified with the Army, Smith 
said. But with this fiscal year's enlistment goal of 74,500 men and 
women expected to fall at least 7,000 short in the worst recruiting 
year since 1979, there's also a recognition it may be time to 
jiggle the jingle. 
</P>
<P>
	Roland Rust, professor of advertising and marketing at  
Vanderbilt University, said the Army slogan rivals Nike's ``Just Do 
It'' for staying power. However, he said, ``You have to ask whether 
Generation-X is wanting to be all that it can be.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It may be the case that the current generation is a little  
more pragmatic and short term in its orientation. They are saying, 
'What's in it for me,''' Rust said. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this year, Advertising Age magazine ranked ``Be all that  
you can be'' the No. 2 jingle of the century, behind McDonald's 
``You deserve a break today'' and ahead of Pepsi's ``Pepsi Cola 
hits the spot.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bob Garfield, Advertising Age's advertising critic, contended it  
would be a mistake, in these booming economic times, to change the 
core message of that 18-year-old jingle -- that the Army offers a 
way to tap one's inner strength. 
</P>
<P>
	``When the economy is bad and money is tight, the Army looks  
magnificent, but right now it's not a very good deal unless the 
prospective recruit can see some benefit that doesn't come down to 
dollars and cents,'' Garfield said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought it was the most effective slogan they had,'' said  
Paul Reuther of Ijamsville, Md., questioned as he was leaving work 
in downtown Washington. ``A friend of mine, ... a pacifist, always 
said it was a great slogan because that's what we all should do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Heather Blackburn, a George Washington University student  
from Sacramento, Calif., thinks the slogan may need a face-lift. A 
22-year-old friend of hers just enlisted in the Army and his 
friends gave him some ribbing about being all he could be. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not that contemporary,'' Blackburn said.  
</P>
<P>
	The Army plans to spend at least $92 million on an ad campaign  
aimed at increasing new enlistees next year to 80,000, Smith said. 
Among other stratagems, he said, are sending younger people to work 
in recruiting offices and giving new recruits leave after basic 
training to talk to their friends back home about the Army 
experience. 
</P>
<P>
	All the military services are finding it tough to attract young  
people when the economy is good, jobs are plentiful and more high 
school graduates are going on to college. 
</P>
<P>
	But Smith said the Army has ``the largest sales barrier because  
we have the image of people in the mud; we tend to take hits a 
little harder.''

<HEADLINE> FDA Approves Quick Pneumonia Test </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Doctors struggling to decide whether a  
wheezing patient needs antibiotics to treat pneumonia are about to 
get a simple, 15-minute test to help their diagnosis. 
</P>
<P>
	The Food and Drug Administration approved Binax Inc.'s  
first-of-a-kind pneumonia test Monday. It uses a patient's urine to 
detect a bacterium called Streptococcus pneumoniae, which is 
estimated to cause 500,000 cases of pneumonia a year. 
</P>
<P>
	The test should help doctors decide more quickly if a patient's  
pneumonia is caused by that bacteria, and thus what treatment is 
needed. 
</P>
<P>
	That's a crucial decision for today's doctors because of a  
growing army of ``supergerms,'' bacteria impervious to antibiotics. 
Just this month, the government announced that infections caused by 
antibiotic-resistant Strep pneumoniae are on the rise. 
</P>
<P>
	Antibiotics have no effect on viruses. They kill only bacteria.  
But symptoms alone don't let doctors tell if pneumonia is caused by 
a virus or bacteria. Conventional pneumonia tests analyze either 
phlegm or blood and can take two to three days to more than a week. 
Consequently, doctors often prescribe antibiotics to be safe -- the 
best decision for a patient with bacterial pneumonia but an 
unnecessary exposure to antibiotics for patients whose pneumonia 
was caused by a virus. 
</P>
<P>
	Why is that a problem? Unnecessary use of antibiotics leads  
other bacteria in the body to evolve resistance to the drugs. That 
could mean that if the patient were to contract a bacterial 
infection later, antibiotics might not help. 
</P>
<P>
	Binax's new pneumonia test detects an antigen, or protein,  
present on bacterial cells that gets into patients' urine soon 
after symptoms appear. The antigen acts as a marker for 
strep-caused pneumonia. 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors simply stick a swab into a patient's urine sample and  
put it on a special reactive strip that within 15 minutes signals 
if it detects the strep antigen. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a very rapid test, you can get results back quickly,''  
said FDA clinical test chief Dr. Steven Gutman. Pneumonia is ``a 
hard diagnosis,'' he added, so easy, quick results ``certainly are 
a main advantage.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Binax tested 373 patients already proven to have strep-caused  
pneumonia, and the new test was 93 percent accurate, the FDA said. 
Then Binax tested it on 215 patients with pneumonia symptoms but 
not necessarily the strep kind. In those patients, the test was 78 
percent accurate, the FDA said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not a perfect test,'' cautioned Gutman, who stressed that  
doctors should continue to use conventional laboratory tests to 
confirm the new rapid test. 
</P>
<P>
	Plus, strep isn't the only bacteria to cause pneumonia, although  
it is the most common bacterial culprit in outpatient doctors' 
offices. 
</P>
<P>
	Portland, Maine-based Binax said it was ready to ship the tests  
to doctors' offices immediately. They will cost doctors $15 to $20.

<HEADLINE> NFL Ignored Drug Violations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The NFL said Monday that it deferred substance  
abuse suspensions for 16 players as part of 1993 negotiations with 
its players union on a new and stronger drug policy. 
</P>
<P>
	The league said the 16 would have been suspended had it not been  
for the negotiations. Instead, they were put into a mandatory 
counseling and treatment program when negotiations were completed 
in 1995. League spokesman Greg Aiello said six were eventually 
suspended for later violations. 
</P>
<P>
	In its statement, the league said that it agreed to withhold the  
suspensions in order to get the union to agree to a stronger 
policy. That policy was included in the 1995 agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	``While the new policy was being negotiated, there were 16  
players whose discipline under the old program was deferred pending 
completion of the negotiations,'' the league said. 
</P>
<P>
	``In 1995, all 16 players were slotted into the new program,  
tested regularly, treated by professional counselors and physicians 
and subject to suspension for any further violations ... The 1995 
program is the most comprehensive in professional sports,'' 
</P>
<P>
	The deferrals were first disclosed by The New York Times, which  
reviewed 40 tapes from a NFL Players Association meeting in Hawaii 
in 1995. They were made by a film company hired by the union in an 
effort to improve its relationships with its players, the Times 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the film company sued the union in a dispute over  
payment, and the NFLPA never took control of the tapes. 
</P>
<P>
	The videotapes reportedly show Doug Allen, the union's assistant  
executive director, discussing differences between the new drug 
policy and the old one. Allen told the players that a number had 
failed drug tests and faced suspensions, but because of a private 
agreement with the NFL, the players would not be suspended. 
</P>
<P>
	Other discussions on the tapes include an offer by a union  
official to teach players ways to circumvent the salary cap; 
debates on substance abuse; and assertions that some union members 
believed racism was behind the league's push to ban players from 
wearing bandannas. 
</P>
<P>
	League sources told the AP that the two men behind the ban on  
bandannas are both black -- Gene Washington, the league's 
disciplinarian, and Minnesota coach Dennis Green.

<HEADLINE> Dollar Dragged Down by Stock Slip </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The dollar was pulled down by sagging U.S.  
stocks Monday, losing ground to both the euro and the yen in 
listless trading. 
</P>
<P>
	In late New York trading, the euro was quoted at $1.0462, up  
slightly from 1.0459 Friday. The dollar also was quoted at 110.73 
Japanese yen, down from 111.56. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a very quiet and lethargic session,'' said Dieter  
Bluhm, vice president for foreign exchange at Wells Fargo Bank in 
San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar's fate was once again tied to that of American  
stocks, which tumbled for a third straight session Monday on 
worries that the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates again 
this year after two rate hikes this summer. 
</P>
<P>
	Stock traders fretted over Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan's  
comments on Friday, when he said inflation-fighters at the central 
bank will be monitoring the stock market more closely when setting 
interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
	Even with its recent declines, the dollar is expected to remain  
strong in Europe because confidence remains shaky in the euro, 
Europe's fledgling, single economy, according to Bluhm, The 
situation is different in Japan, however, where the yen has surged 
in recent weeks, tracing the gains made by the Nikkei, Japan's 
benchmark stock index. 
</P>
<P>
	``If the Dow Jones industrial average continues to fall, it  
doesn't bode well for the dollar in Asian markets,'' Bluhm added. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar also was quoted at 1.5306 Swiss francs, down from  
1.5310, and 1.4935 Canadian dollars, up from 1.4890. The British 
pound rose to $1.5896 from $1.5878. 
</P>
<P>
	Currencies of the 11 countries participating in the euro are no  
longer traded separately and are tied to the euro by a fixed rate. 
Based on Monday's euro rate, the dollar was worth: 1.8694 German 
marks, down from 1.8702; 6.2695 French francs, down from 6.2722; 
and 1,850.59 Italian lire, down from 1,851.21.

<HEADLINE> Clintons Visit New York State Fair </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SYRACUSE, N.Y. (AP) -- While his wife hugged babies in true  
candidate style, President Clinton today repeated his call for 
using federal budget surpluses to shore up Medicare and Social 
Security instead of offering Americans a tax cut. 
</P>
<P>
	The president and first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton visited the  
New York State Fair, and attended a luncheon with State Comptroller 
Carl McCall. Clinton seized the chance to talk about the budget 
surplus, comparing himself and Congress to ``farmers sitting on a 
good crop'' and trying to figure out how to use that crop to their 
best advantage. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had a great crop last year. We're sitting on a lot of  
money,'' he said. ``What are we going to do with it?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton, who is considering a run for the Senate from New  
York, hugged babies, signed autographs and accepted gifts of 
flowers and notecards from people in the crowd. Working the rope 
line alongside her was Mike Bragman, majority leader of the New 
York State Assembly. 
</P>
<P>
	One woman held up a sign saying, ``Clinton for Senate,'' and  
nearby a man had a T-shirt with an electronic image of himself with 
Mrs. Clinton. The first lady said she is ``learning a lot about the 
diversity of New York'' as she travels the state listening to 
people, and has seen a spirit of unity ``that really does represent 
the best of this state.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``New York has always been at the center of whatever is  
happening, not only in our country but in the world,'' Mrs. Clinton 
said. ``But as much progress as we have made, we know we have more 
work to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton offered his memories of state fairs he has attended in  
his political life -- including one in Arkansas, where he wore a 
pinstripe suit and wingtip shoes, and ended up riding a horse. 
</P>
<P>
	The first family shook hands with some of more than 2,500  
cheering well-wishers who greeted them on their arrival at the 
airport here today. 
</P>
<P>
	Officially, Mrs. Clinton is only exploring a run in New York in  
2000, but today's destination was a clue that she intends to go 
ahead with the campaign. The Clintons are spending five days at a 
borrowed estate in Skaneateles in the scenic Finger Lakes region. 
The venue will allow Mrs. Clinton to do a little politicking in a 
heavily Republican part of the state. 
</P>
<P>
	Sunday's dinner at the estate of film producer Jane Rosenthal  
brought in about $1 million for the Democratic National Committee 
and Mrs. Clinton's expected campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	For $25,000 a couple, attendees heard rock singer Jon Bon Jovi  
and ate lobster salad with organic greens. 
</P>
<P>
	The dinner was the last event in a busy weekend of Democratic  
fund raising in the Hamptons, a swank group of towns on the Long 
Island seashore. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clintons used the Hamptons home of filmmaker Steven  
Spielberg as a base while attending five Democratic events. Four 
brought in cash for Mrs. Clinton's presumed race, or for Democratic 
candidates generally. 
</P>
<P>
	Howard Wolfson, spokesman for Mrs. Clinton's exploratory  
committee, said the campaign expected to collect about $400,000 
during the weekend. That is about half the total she expected to 
bring in during the entire vacation trip, which began with 
fund-raisers on the Massachusetts resort islands of Nantucket and 
Martha's Vineyard, and will end with two events near Skaneateles on 
Thursday.

<HEADLINE> Lewis, Holyfield Conference Tuesday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAS VEGAS (AP) -- More than five months after they met in a  
controversial heavyweight unification title fight, Evander 
Holyfield and Lennox Lewis will get together once again Tuesday to 
discuss their rematch. 
</P>
<P>
	The fighters are scheduled to be at a news conference at the Las  
Vegas Hilton to formally announce the Nov. 13 rematch. 
</P>
<P>
	Both will reportedly get about $15 million for the rematch,  
which will be held at the UNLV campus arena. 
</P>
<P>
	Their first fight March 13 ended in a draw, despite the opinion  
of most ringside observers that Lewis won the fight. It sparked 
several investigations into the scoring, particularly that of the 
one judge who favored Holyfield. 
</P>
<P>
	Holyfield owns the IBF and WBA heavyweight titles, while Lewis  
is the WBC champion.

<HEADLINE> Former PairGain Employee Sentenced </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- A former employee who drove up the price of  
PairGain Technologies Inc. stock by posting a fake news story on 
the Internet was sentenced Monday to five months of home detention 
and five years of probation, avoiding a jail term. 
</P>
<P>
	Gary Dale Hoke, 26, of Raleigh, N.C., also was ordered to pay  
$93,000 to investors who purchased PairGain stock and sold at a 
loss after the company denied the bogus report that it was about to 
be purchased by an Israeli company for $1.35 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	In rejecting recommendations for a prison sentence, the judge  
questioned whether part of the blame for the scam was the lack of 
Internet safeguards to prevent posting of false messages. 
</P>
<P>
	Hoke, who did not profit from the hoax, pleaded guilty to two  
counts of securities fraud. 
</P>
<P>
	He was originally charged with five counts and faced a maximum  
sentence of 10 years in prison and up to $1 million in fines per 
count. 
</P>
<P>
	In a separate settlement with the Securities and Exchange  
Commission, Hoke admitted disseminating fraudulent information 
about Tustin, Calif.-based PairGain and agreed to comply with 
federal antifraud regulations in the future. 
</P>
<P>
	The April 7 hoax pushed up PairGain stock more than 30 percent,  
from $8.50 per share to as high as $11.25. Trading on the stock 
that day amounted to 13.7 million shares, about seven times its 
average trading volume. The price of PairGain stock fell back to 
$9.38 per share when the company issued a statement denying such a 
deal was in the works. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Terry Hatter dismissed prosecutors  
recommendation of 12 months to 13 months in prison, saying he was 
convinced Hoke's decision to post the fraudulent story was an 
aberration in an otherwise honorable life. 
</P>
<P>
	Hatter also criticized professional investors who failed to  
verify the fake report before buying PairGain stock, and said he 
was impressed by a letter in which Hoke's mother said her son was 
``a victim of the Internet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, the judge pointed to a lack of safeguards to screen  
out false postings on the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	``It doesn't seem right that we proceed with this matter  
criminally when we don't have protections out there,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hoke told Hatter he posted the story to counter chat room  
messages that disparaged PairGain and the value of its stock. He 
said he believed those messages were posted by traders who hoped to 
profit by driving down the price of the company's shares. 
</P>
<P>
	Hoke owned 1,000 shares of company stock and had options on  
another 5,000. He sold none of them during the hoax. 
</P>
<P>
	``As a PairGain stockholder, it just made me unhappy. I felt I  
could influence the negative remarks people were making in a 
positive way. It was stupid,'' Hoke told reporters outside the 
courtroom. 
</P>
<P>
	Hoke, who was employed at PairGain's North Carolina facility as  
a computer hardware engineer when he posted the story, now works 
for a Raleigh, N.C., software firm. 
</P>
<P>
	The home detention portion of the sentence was designed to allow  
Hoke to work in order to make restitution. 
</P>
<P>
	Christopher Painter, the assistant U.S. attorney who prosecuted  
the case, said Hoke wanted to make money on the deal, but got cold 
feet when the fake story generated more trading activity than he 
expected. 
</P>
<P>
	The sentence will serve as a deterrent, even though Hoke  
received no prison time, Painter said. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was ordered to pay substantial restitution and he's subject  
to a five-year period where his conduct is substantially limited,'' 
Painter said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hoke planted the story, made to look like a Bloomberg News  
Service article, by using a fake name and an Internet service that 
offers users free Web pages. Hoke then linked the Web page to 
messages about PairGain that he posted in Internet chat rooms. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators identified Hoke as its creator by tracing the Web  
page and chat room postings to his Internet service provider, said 
Painter. 
</P>
<P>
	Internet stock hoaxes commonly consist of false messages posted  
in investment chat rooms. The PairGain hoax was unique in that Hoke 
created a Web page and story credible enough to dupe even 
sophisticated investors, said Painter. 
</P>
<P>
	Those taken in included a number of professional investors,  
including James Cramer, president of the New York money management 
firm Cramer Berkowitz and co-founder of the financial Web site 
TheStreet.com 
</P>
<P>
	Bloomberg LP, parent company of the news service, has filed a  
related lawsuit against Hoke in federal court in New York City, 
seeking unspecified damages.

<HEADLINE> No. 8 Miami 23, No. 13 Ohio St. 12 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EAST RUTHERFORD, N. J. (AP) -- Miami's new guys fared a lot  
better than Ohio State's in the Kickoff Classic. 
</P>
<P>
	And the result has the Hurricanes feeling like champions for the  
first time in years and the Buckeyes feeling like Arizona after its 
loss to Penn State in the Pigskin Classic. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now I know how Dick Tomey felt,'' Cooper said Sunday,  
referring to the Arizona coach. ``I feel the same way today.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kenny Kelly's first start for Miami was a memorable one. He lost  
two fumbles and threw two interceptions, but passed for one 
touchdown, ran for another and hit two 2-point conversions as the 
'Canes beat the Buckeyes 23-12 before a Giants Stadium crowd of 
73,037. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're good, we're very good,'' Kelly said after completing 17  
of 25 passes for 245 yards and being voted the game's MVP. ``But 
for us to be in the same league as the Miami teams of the late 
'80s, we have to finish 13-0. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I'm sitting in the Louisiana Superdome with you, and we  
come out with a win, then I'll tell you we're back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	James Jackson, who moved in at tailback for Edgerrin James, ran  
44 yards for a first-quarter TD and finished with 89 yards on 24 
carries for Miami. 
</P>
<P>
	Ohio State didn't fare as well in replacing its stars. Austin  
Moherman, trying to step in for Joe Germaine, was 10-of-22 for 107 
yards, one TD and two interceptions. Reggie Germany had four 
catches for 56 yards and no TDs moving in for David Boston. 
</P>
<P>
	Cornerback Nate Clements, taking Antoine Winfield's spot, was  
beaten several times, including on Kelly's 67-yard TD pass to 
Santana Moss with eight seconds left in the half that put Miami 
ahead 23-9. 
</P>
<P>
	Even though it was just the first game of the season, the win  
could be the biggest for the Hurricanes since the school was hit 
with NCAA probation in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	The three-year penalty cut a total of 31 football scholarships,  
and when Dennis Erickson left as coach, Miami brought back former 
assistant Butch Davis, who has spent the past four years trying to 
change the bad-boy image and rebuild the program that won four 
national titles from 1983-91. 
</P>
<P>
	``This was a great way to start out the season, and I'm very  
proud of the kids,'' Davis said. ``We're 1-0, but we're not back 
yet. It's been a long rebuilding job and this is a nice step 
forward.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Davis said Miami's 49-45 win over UCLA at the end of last season  
told him the program was on the upswing. The win over Ohio State, 
an annual title contender the past four years, is an even bigger 
step forward. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's too early to say (whether we're back),'' Hurricanes  
tailback James Jackson, who ran ``We'll have to see what we do 
against Penn State and Florida State.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the AP's first regular-season poll, the Hurricanes moved from  
No. 12 to No. 8 -- their first top 10 ranking since the fifth game 
of the 1996 season. Ohio State fell from No. 9 to No. 13. 
</P>
<P>
	Miami plays No. 2 Penn State on Sept. 18, and No. 1 Florida  
State on Oct. 9. 
</P>
<P>
	Cooper isn't used to losing so early in the season. The rare  
losses during his first 11 years in Columbus usually occur at the 
end of the season, against Michigan, or in a bowl game. 
</P>
<P>
	The loss was the Buckeyes' first in a season opener since a  
16-10 loss to Alabama in the 1986 Kickoff Classic -- before Cooper 
took over. 
</P>
<P>
	The game was far from a classic. Each team lost two fumbles and  
threw two interceptions; and the teams were called for a total of 
17 penalties, and there were three missed field goals -- two by 
Miami. 
</P>
<P>
	In a 3:06 span late in the first half, Kelly ran 7 yards on a  
nifty bootleg to put Miami ahead for good, and then threw his long 
TD pass to Moss. 
</P>
<P>
	After his TD run, Kelly threw for a 2-point conversion and after  
his TD pass he ran for 2-pointer as Miami erased Ohio State's 9-7 
first-quarter lead. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know if that TD at the end of the half was the turning  
point or not,'' Kelly said of his hookup with Moss, ``but it put us 
up and it let them down.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There was no doubt in Cooper's mind.  
</P>
<P>
	``Their wide receivers made so many big plays against us, but  
that jump ball just before halftime was the biggest play of the 
game,'' Cooper said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ohio State, which averaged 498 yards per game in '98, had just  
220 yards. It was the Buckeyes' lowest point total since a 13-9 
loss to Michigan in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	In the second half, the Buckeyes managed only a 24-yard field  
goal by Dan Stultz in the third quarter. Miami ran 7:39 off the 
clock to start the fourth quarter, moving 79 yards on 16 plays 
before Andy Crosland missed a 26-yard field goal. Miami's Leonard 
Myers then intercepted a pass by Moherman with 6:24 left, and the 
Buckeyes were finished. 
</P>
<P>
	Steve Bellisari, Moherman's backup, played two series in the  
second quarter and really put his team in a hole. His attempted 
screen pass was called a lateral and went for an 11-yard loss and 
cost the Buckeyes an easy field-goal attempt. On the next 
possession, he fumbled the snap, linebacker Dan Morgan recovered 
and set the stage for Miami's two-TD barrage at the end of the 
half. 
</P>
<P>
	Moss finished with three catches for 115 yards. Ohio State's  
Michael Wiley, who ran 69 yards in the first quarter, ended up with 
72 yards on nine carries. 
</P>
<P>
	``We know we're a good team,'' Moss said. ``We just have to go  
out and show it each week. Hey man, we just try to make plays and 
win games.''

<HEADLINE> Nilsson Injured for Rest of Season </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MILWAUKEE (AP) -- Milwaukee Brewers All-Star catcher David  
Nilsson will miss the rest of the season because of a broken thumb, 
a newspaper reported. 
</P>
<P>
	The catcher's teammates learned the news shortly before taking  
the field against the San Diego Padres on Sunday, the Milwaukee 
Journal Sentinel said in Monday's editions. The Brewers lost the 
game 5-4. 
</P>
<P>
	Nilsson was struck by a foul tip at the start of Saturday's game  
against the Padres. 
</P>
<P>
	The 29-year-old native of Brisbane, Australia, joined the  
Brewers in 1987 as an undrafted free agent. 
</P>
<P>
	Nilsson, the first Australian player ever to make a major league  
All-Star team, arranged his contract to become a free agent after 
this season. He is considering playing for Australia in next year's 
Summer Olympics in Sydney. 
</P>
<P>
	When he was named to the team in July, Nilsson was leading NL  
catchers with 19 homers to go with his .315 batting average and 51 
RBIs.

<HEADLINE> Browns' Spielman Ponders Retirement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BEREA, Ohio (AP) -- When the Cleveland Browns signed him, Chris  
Spielman gave them his word. He promised if he couldn't play at an 
acceptable level, he would hand in his jersey and walk away from 
football without shedding a tear. 
</P>
<P>
	That day might have arrived prematurely for No. 54.  
</P>
<P>
	Spielman, the Browns' intense middle linebacker attempting a  
comeback from neck fusion surgery in 1997, could announce his 
retirement today after sustaining a second ``stinger'' in his 
surgically repaired neck following a violent hit in an exhibition 
game on Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Spielman suffered temporary paralysis after being blindsided by  
Bears center Casey Wiegmann during the Browns' 35-24 win over 
Chicago. The 33-year-old Spielman was helped from the field after 
the collision and taken to the Cleveland Clinic for an MRI. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the second time during the preseason that Spielman has  
had to undergo tests following a ferocious hit. On the first day of 
training camp, he and fullback Tarek Saleh had a helmet-to-helmet 
collision that initially gave Spielman second thoughts about his 
comeback. 
</P>
<P>
	After the most recent hit, Spielman, an Ohio football icon, is  
again contemplating retirement. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's exploring all of his options,'' said Browns coach Chris  
Palmer, who spoke to Spielman twice on Sunday. ``He's trying to 
think things out. He's looking at things from different sides. He's 
going to look at everything and go from there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Palmer wouldn't go so far as to say if he recommended to  
Spielman that the 10-year veteran should retire. However, Palmer 
intimated all that may be left for Spielman to do was announce his 
career was over. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's some things that have to be ironed out, discussed,  
looked at,'' said Palmer, who was visibly shaken after Saturday's 
game. ``I think once that's all done, I think we'll be in pretty 
good shape.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After speaking with Spielman over the phone early Sunday morning  
from the hospital, Palmer said the two visited again at 8 a.m. in 
Palmer's office. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had a good conversation,'' Palmer said. ``It was very  
candid. It was a situation that he expressed some things to me, I 
expressed some things to him that will remain private. That's 
between the coach and the player. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wanted a clear mind in the morning to talk to him. I think  
he had a clear mind and came in and talked to me. The fact we 
talked man-to-man and eye-to-eye is real good.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Spielman was unavailable for comment on Sunday.  
</P>
<P>
	Defending a screen play in the first quarter against the Bears,  
Spielman shed and spun off one blocker, but as he turned and before 
he could get his feet planted, Wiegmann buried him. 
</P>
<P>
	Spielman stayed on the ground for several moments, and later  
told Cleveland offensive tackle Lomas Brown, who also played with 
him in Detroit, that he had been momentarily paralyzed. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's scary,'' Brown said. ``I don't want to tell him what to  
do, but I think he should have a long talk with his wife Stefanie 
and think about what he wants to do. Life is more important that 
football.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wiegmann offered Spielman some assistance after the play.  
</P>
<P>
	``I thought I hit him good, but I didn't think I did that,''  
Wiegmann said. ``He looked me right in the eye, and I was going to 
help him up but he said to me he didn't want to get up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Spielman had two vertebrae fused in his neck in 1997 while he  
was with the Buffalo Bills. He missed the final eight games that 
season, and was prepared to come back last year. 
</P>
<P>
	But he put his playing career on hold to care for his family  
after his wife underwent breast cancer surgery. Stefanie is now 
cancer-free. 
</P>
<P>
	The Browns signed him to a three-year contract in February, and  
Spielman instantly became the expansion team's most popular player 
because of his Ohio roots as a high school star at Massillon and 
All-America at Ohio State. 
</P>
<P>
	Spielman has always played every down as if it was his last, and  
the toll of more than 20 years of punishment may have finally 
caught up to him. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's nobody playing this game that's 50 years old,'' Palmer  
said. ``You only have so many blocks, so many tackles in your body, 
and the guy upstairs says it's time to sit back and watch somebody 
else play. That happens sometimes when you're 18, sometimes when 
you're 22 or 35. But it happens.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If Spielman's career is over, the Browns are losing more than  
just an inside linebacker, Palmer said. Their losing a player with 
an unparalleled work ethic who leads by example. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's one of a kind,'' Palmer said. ``He's a guy that owes  
everything to football. He's a guy that respects the game, has a 
passion for the game. His family is in football, he probably grew 
up with a football on the kitchen table. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's a guy who some people call an overachiever. I don't know  
if that's true because of the production he has had. If there were 
more guys like that, coaching would be very easy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Taken in the second round of the 1988 draft by Detroit, Spielman  
spent his first eight seasons with the Lions before signing as a 
free agent with Buffalo in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	A four-time Pro Bowl selection, he's made 1,441 tackles with 10  
sacks and six interceptions in 10 seasons. He has started in all 
148 he has played.

<HEADLINE> Teen Cleared for Late-Term Abortion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- The Arizona Supreme Court has cleared the way for  
a 14-year-old girl to get a late-term abortion in another state. 
</P>
<P>
	On a 3-2 telephone conference vote Sunday, the high court  
overturned Appeals Court Judge Michael Ryan's decision Saturday to 
bar the girl from having the procedure performed in Kansas, said 
John MacDonald, the Supreme Court's spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
	Ryan's ruling came after Gov. Jane Hull and state Attorney  
General Janet Napolitano argued that the pregnancy may be too 
advanced to terminate. The girl is said to be 24 weeks pregnant. 
</P>
<P>
	A ward of the state since she was 5 and now a ward of Maricopa  
County Superior Court, the girl told authorities she was raped. She 
requested an abortion 14 weeks into the pregnancy but then ran 
away, showing up again only recently. 
</P>
<P>
	The case was brought before the appeals court after Superior  
Court Judge William Sargeant on Saturday reaffirmed an earlier 
decision to permit the abortion. 
</P>
<P>
	The Arizona Republic newspaper, which reported Ryan's ruling  
Sunday, said it was not clear why the judge decided to overturn the 
decision allowing the abortion to go forward. Rulings related to 
the case have been kept secret because the girl is a juvenile.

	No Arizona clinics provide abortions after 20 weeks. Late-term  
abortions in Arizona are allowed only when the life or health of

	Dr. Carolyn Gerster, chairwoman of Arizona Right to Life, said  
she's outraged at the high court's decision, saying by this time, 
the case was really that of a premature baby, not a fetus. ``What 
crime did this baby commit to be sentenced to death?'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	But Bruce Miller, director of Arizona Right to Choose, said the  
Supreme Court made the right decision. and society must respect the 
girl's decision ``and let her get on with her life.''

	NEW YORK (AP) -- Three months after she won the last of her 22  
Grand Slam tournament titles, Steffi Graf has disappeared from the 
WTA Tour rankings. 
</P>
<P>
	At No. 3 in the world, he 30-year-old German right-hander became  
the highest-ranked player ever to retire from professional play. 
She informed the WTA Tour on Saturday of her decision to remove 
herself from the rankings. 
</P>
<P>
	Margaret Smith Court in 1977, Chris Evert in 1990, Manuela  
Maleeva-Fragniere in 1994, Martina Navratilova in 1995 and Kimiko 
Date in 1996 all requested their names be removed from the rankings 
shortly after retiring. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *NOW A ROUTINE:* Nicolas Escude of France has raised the  
come-from-behind rally to an art form. 
</P>
<P>
	At the 1998 Australian Open, Escude rallied from two sets down  
to win three consecutive matches, the first time that has been done 
in the open era. En route to the quarterfinals, he defeated Magnus 
Larsson, Richey Reneberg and Nicolas Kiefer. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, Escude did it again, dropping the first two sets 4-6,  
4-6 to Magnus Gustafsson before winning the next three 7-6 (8-6), 
6-2, 6-4 as the U.S. Open began its two-week run at the National 
Tennis Center. 
</P>
<P>
	Gustafsson had two match points in the third-set tiebreaker.  
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *ATTENDANCE UP:* The WTA Tour is becoming more popular.  
</P>
<P>
	Attendance for the 1999 tour has already surpassed 3 million,  
the first time that many people have watched women's tennis prior 
to the U.S. Open. 
</P>
<P>
	With a record crowd of 74,236 at the Pilot Pen tournament in New  
Haven, Conn., last week, the WTA Tour 1999 attendance total is 
3,026,491 in 42 tournaments. 
</P>
<P>
	The attendance record of 3,675,094 was set last year.  
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *UNLUCKY LOSER:* Phillip King of Long Beach, Calif., has yet to  
win a match in his two ATP Tour events. But he has a good reason. 
</P>
<P>
	By the luck of the draw, the 17-year-old right-hander had to  
play Pete Sampras, the world's top player and reigning Wimbledon 
champion, in the Mercedes-Benz Cup in Los Angeles in July. Then, 
playing in his first U.S. Open, King's first-round opponent was 
12th-seeded Richard Krajicek of the Netherlands, who won Wimbledon 
in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	King received a wild-card entry into the U.S. Open by winning  
the USTA National Boys' 18-and-under title in Kalamazoo, Mich. He 
received a wild-card entry into the Mercedes-Benz Cup by winning 
the Boys' 18 title at the Easter Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *SPECIAL EXHIBIT:* Althea Gibson, Arthur Ashe, Bill Tilden, Don  
Budge, Jimmy Connors and John McEnroe will be among the stars at 
the U.S. Open this year. 
</P>
<P>
	The former champions are part of an exhibit entitled ``Their  
Eyes on the Prize,'' which can be viewed at newly renovated Louis 
Armstrong Stadium at the National Tennis Center, site of the year's 
final Grand Slam tournament. The exhibit is jointly presented by 
the United States Tennis Association and the International Tennis 
Hall of Fame. 
</P>
<P>
	Historic trophies and champions from more than 100 years of U.S.  
National Championships will be featured in the exhibition, 
including Richard Sears, Helen Wills Moody, Helen Jacobs, Tony 
Trabert, Billie Jean King and Chris Evert. 
</P>
<P>
	``One of the Hall of Fame's key missions is to bring tennis  
history to broader audiences and tennis enthusiasts beyond the 
walls of the Hall of Fame Museum in Newport, R.I.,'' said Jane 
Brown, president of the International Tennis Hall of Fame. ``By 
teaming with the USTA to present this exhibition at the U.S. Open, 
we will give more people an opportunity to learn about and 
appreciate the sport's rich history.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *ACES FOR DOLLARS:* When Lindsay Davenport, Venus Williams or  
any other player on the WTA Tour serves an ace at this year's U.S. 
Open, they will be scoring points with hundreds of New York City 
girls. 
</P>
<P>
	The Chase Manhattan Bank will donate $50 for every ace served  
during women's singles matches at the 1999 U.S. Open to fund the 
Chase Tennis Camps for Girls, a project of the City Parks 
Foundation and City of New York Parks &AMP; Recreation. 
</P>
<P>
	Chase, sponsor of the U.S. Open women's singles, launched the  
Chase Tennis Camps for Girls, the first free citywide program to 
identify and develop the tennis skills of talented young female 
players, in 1997. The 150 girls, 30 from each of the city's five 
boroughs, ages 10-16, will receive a free six-week tennis 
instruction program, with the program culminating with the girls 
being honored at the season-ending Chase Championships at Madison 
Square Garden Nov. 15-21.

<HEADLINE> NC State Victory Stuns Texas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUSTIN, Texas (AP) -- Texas can forget about replacing Ricky  
Williams. The Longhorns have to worry about finding punt 
protection. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite a dominating defensive performance that held North  
Carolina State to 172 yards and one offensive score, Texas gave up 
a school-record three blocked punts that led to 16 points in the 
Wolfpack's 23-20 victory Saturday night in the Black Coaches 
Association Classic. 
</P>
<P>
	NC State returned two fourth-quarter blocks by freshman Terrence  
Holt for touchdowns. The Wolfpack could have scored another TD on a 
first-quarter block but three players couldn't pick up the ball 
before it rolled out of the back of the end zone for a safety. 
</P>
<P>
	The Longhorns were ranked 17th in the preseason Top 25 but  
dropped out Sunday night, replaced by North Carolina State, which 
moved into the rankings at No. 24. 
</P>
<P>
	Changes will be made on Texas' punt team, which had too many  
inexperienced players, coach Mack Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've got reevaluate what we're doing there and how not to put  
those young guys in those tough spots,'' Brown said. ``We felt like 
we could block one of their punts. We didn't and they did.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brown thought he solved one problem during the game. Figuring  
junior offensive lineman and long-snapper Marcel Blanchard was 
tiring, Brown replaced him with freshman Hunter McWilliams after 
the second block. McWilliams snapped the ball well on the final 
block but the protection broke down. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's something Stanford will try to exploit next weekend,''  
Brown said. ``We'll probably be nervous about it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A season-opening loss was not what the Texas faithful had  
envisioned after a resurgent 9-3 campaign in 1998. More than 80,000 
packed Royal-Memorial Stadium to watch the continued rebirth of 
their once-dormant program. 
</P>
<P>
	They were stunned when Holt, younger brother of former Wolfpack  
All-America wideout Torry Holt, recorded his second block. Eric 
Leak picked up the loose ball and returned it for the winning 
touchdown with 3:22 to play. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a devastating loss for our kids and our fans and I hate  
it,'' Brown said. ``Thank goodness it's the first game and not the 
last.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For North Carolina State, it was the third early season upset in  
as many years with victories over Syracuse in 1997 and Florida 
State last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Wolfpack players ran onto the field in celebration at the final  
gun. The victory left coach Mike O'Cain beaming about his team's 
rise from consecutive 3-8 seasons in 1995 and 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were almost run out of Raleigh three years ago, and now we  
beat Texas on national TV,'' O'Cain said. 
</P>
<P>
	Offensively, the Wolfpack struggled. After giving up 99 yards in  
the first quarter, Texas' defense clamped down on the NC State 
running backs and quarterback Jamie Barnette. 
</P>
<P>
	The ACC's total offense leader in 1998, Barnette was 9-of-26 for  
65 yards with one interception. It was his worst outing as a 
starter as the offense totaled just seven first downs.. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm so grateful we won. So grateful,'' Barnette said. ``We  
can't play any worse that this on offense, and we still win the 
game.''

<HEADLINE> Russia Sets Economic Growth Goal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MOSCOW (AP) -- The Russian government is aiming for 5 percent  
average annual economic growth over the next eight to 10 years, the 
Economics Ministry said in a report released Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The report, carried by the ITAR-Tass news agency, gave no  
details on how the government plans to achieve that somewhat 
optimistic goal. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia's economy has contracted for each of the past 10 years  
with the exception of 1997, when it grew by 0.4 percent. The 
economy is forecast to contract by 2 percent this year. 
</P>
<P>
	The Economics Ministry report, which was reviewed during  
Monday's Cabinet meeting, predicts industrial production will grow 
by 4 percent and agriculture by 3 percent in 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	Production in Russia has risen in the past year, after years of  
decline, because the devaluation of the ruble last August made 
imports prohibitively expensive for most Russians and increased 
demand for cheap domestic goods. 
</P>
<P>
	But Russia's finances remain in sad shape. Its biggest problem  
is paying off its massive foreign debt, which will hit $166 billion 
on January 1.

<HEADLINE> Hotmail Temporarily Shut Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	REDMOND, Wash. (AP) -- Microsoft said a security flaw in it's  
free Hotmail e-mail system that left millions of accounts 
vulnerable was patched before anyone was hurt by the breach. 
</P>
<P>
	``The good news is the Hotmail servers are back up and running  
now and the issue has been resolved,'' Deanna Sanford, lead product 
manager for MSN marketing, Microsoft Corp.'s Internet division, 
said Monday. ``We haven't heard any reports, any customers calling 
to say they were affected by this directly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft shut down its Hotmail e-mail system, which has 40  
million accounts, for about two hours Monday morning after 
discovering the flaw that made accounts vulnerable to outside 
access. The company said the trouble was fixed by 1 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
	``As soon as we were notified, we got our developers and testers  
on it, and we were able to determine a fix,'' Sanford said. 
</P>
<P>
	The problem was first reported by the Swedish newspaper  
Expressen, which said several hackers around the world had set up 
Web sites offering unauthorized access to Hotmail's accounts simply 
by typing in a user name. 
</P>
<P>
	Users were able to read and send mail from any account without  
having the password. 
</P>
<P>
	The Redmond-based software maker did not know how long the  
accounts were accessible. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft posted a note to Hotmail users on its web page Monday,  
apologizing for the shutdown. 
</P>
<P>
	``In light of the inconvenience that such an action can cause  
users, this is not something that we take lightly but felt that, 
given Microsoft's commitment to protecting people's private data 
and information, it was the appropriate course of action,'' the 
company said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Security and privacy are obviously key concerns,'' Microsoft  
spokesman Dan Leach said Monday night in a telephone interview. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everything was brought back on line and everything is fine,''  
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Leach said he knew of no other Microsoft products or services  
that might be similarly vulnerable.

<HEADLINE> Texas Dragging Death Trial To Begin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BRYAN, Texas (AP) -- The case against the second of three whites  
charged in the dragging death of a black man begins with jury 
selection Tuesday a three hours' drive from the East Texas town 
where the crime took place. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawrence Russell Brewer, 32, is charged with murder in the 1998  
slaying of James Byrd Jr. Brewer could get the death penalty for 
the crime, one of the nation's most grisly racial killings since 
the civil rights era. 
</P>
<P>
	His alleged accomplice John William King was found guilty in  
February in Jasper -- the town the crime occurred -- and sentenced to 
death. A third defendant, Shawn Allen Berry, remains in jail, 
waiting for a trial date. 
</P>
<P>
	State District Judge Monter Lawlis moved Brewer's case 150 miles  
west to this central Texas town after defense attorneys argued that 
the people of Jasper were likely to convict to try to salvage their 
small town's reputation. 
</P>
<P>
	Jury selection is expected to last at least two weeks, with  
testimony to begin Sept. 15. 
</P>
<P>
	Byrd, 49, was chained to a pickup and dragged to pieces along a  
rural road. Prosecutors said King and Brewer meant to use the 
killing to launch a hate group and to initiate Berry into their 
ranks. 
</P>
<P>
	After his arrest, Berry allegedly told police that Brewer  
spray-painted Byrd's face black before the victim was chained to 
the truck. 
</P>
<P>
	Brewer has been in and out of prison on drug and burglary  
charges, and prosecutors believe he helped organize a white 
supremacist gang behind bars. 
</P>
<P>
	Brewer's attorney, Doug Barlow, did not return calls for  
comment.

<HEADLINE> Sheppard Drops Exhumation Fight </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- The son of Dr. Sam Sheppard dropped his  
opposition to the exhumation of his mother's body Monday, allowing 
prosecutors to examine the remains of the woman whose murder helped 
inspire ``The Fugitive'' TV series. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors want to get DNA samples from Marilyn Sheppard to  
help them defend the state in the wrongful imprisonment lawsuit 
filed by the Sheppards' son, Sam Reese Sheppard. 
</P>
<P>
	Sheppard spent a decade in prison after being convicted of  
beating his wife to death in July 1954. He was acquitted at a 
retrial in 1966. 
</P>
<P>
	The younger Sheppard contends a window washer killed his mother  
and has worked for the last 10 years to try to clear his father's 
name. If he wins the wrongful imprisonment lawsuit, damages could 
reach as much as $2 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Sheppard, 52, of Oakland, Calif., is upset about the exhumation  
because he feels prosecutors have had 45 years to investigate the 
case and views the exhumation as a last-minute stalling tactic. 
</P>
<P>
	Sheppard's attorney, Terry Gilbert, said the exhumation wasn't  
worth fighting over. 
</P>
<P>
	``We feel it's going to confirm our case or not determine much  
of anything, frankly,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> US Envoy Asks for Kosovo Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- U.S. diplomat Richard Holbrooke  
toured a mixed Serb and Albanian neighborhood today, driving home 
his message that easing ethnic tensions in Kosovo is the ultimate 
test for the United Nations. 
</P>
<P>
	Holbrooke, the former Balkan troubleshooter turned American  
ambassador to the United Nations, has been hammering the same 
message since his arrival Saturday in Kosovo: all parties must work 
toward a pluralistic and democratic society. 
</P>
<P>
	His statement implied that ethnic Albanian revenge attacks  
against the dwindling Serb population in Kosovo must stop. Ethnic 
Albanians, who have a majority in Kosovo, have been seeking to 
avenge the 18-month Serb crackdown that left about 10,000 people 
dead and hundreds of thousands temporary refugees. 
</P>
<P>
	Holbrooke met with officials of the U.N. civilian police force  
in Pristina and also conferred for more than an hour today with the 
commander of the Kosovo Liberation Army, Agim Ceku. Holbrooke 
issued no statement, but Ceku said the two discussed the 
demilitarization of the KLA, expected to be complete by Sept. 19. 
</P>
<P>
	``The KLA will transform in several directions ... One part will  
become part of the police, one part will become civil 
administration, one part will become the Army of Kosovo, as a 
defense force. And another part will form a political party,'' Ceku 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Calling the province in southern Serbia ``the ultimate test of  
the U.N.'s capability and potential,'' Holbrooke underlined the 
complexity of the problems that have plagued Kosovo in the two 
months since the arrival of international peacekeepers. 
</P>
<P>
	``This place has been a mess for a long time, but a different  
kind of mess. The war was messy, the decade that preceded the war 
was messy, the history back to 1912 was messy ... and the task is 
immense,'' Holbrooke said, following a meeting with the top U.N. 
official in Kosovo, Bernard Kouchner. 
</P>
<P>
	Holbrooke congratulated Kouchner on his progress in improving  
security in the province, but he also voiced concern over 
ethnic-based attacks on Kosovo's minorities. 
</P>
<P>
	Since the arrival of the NATO-led peacekeepers, revenge killings  
and violence against Serbs have derailed international attempts to 
establish peace. 
</P>
<P>
	Following his meeting with Serb leaders, Holbrooke expressed  
concern over attacks on Serbian Orthodox religious buildings. 
</P>
<P>
	``These are world heritage sites, and anyone destroying them --  
whatever their reasons, whatever their religion, whatever their 
motivation -- should know that is a criminal vandal act and people 
must respect religious sites,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Prior to the meeting, Yugoslavia's official Tanjug news agency  
criticized Holbrooke for ``not mentioning at all, not with a single 
word ... everyday killings, kidnapping and harassment of Serbs, 
burning of their houses, churches and monasteries.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Holbrooke also made clear the United States is opposed to a Serb  
proposal to create separate enclaves for Serbs in Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	He met with the two rival ethnic Albanian leaders in Kosovo --  
Thaci and Ibrahim Rugova, the moderate leader whose influence has 
weakened during and after NATO's 78-day bombing campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	After meeting Holbrooke on Sunday, Thaci said they agreed on  
``the complete demilitarization of the KLA ... We believe that by 
the 19th of September, the KLA will be completely demilitarized.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Holbrooke helped broker the 1995 Dayton accord, which ended the  
3 1/2-year war in Bosnia. He later served as President Clinton's 
special envoy to Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
	In Belgrade, the private Beta news agency reported that  
peacekeepers Sunday blocked the road leading from southern Serbia 
to Gnjilane in Kosovo, turning back a number of Serbs trying to 
reach relatives in that part of Kosovo. American peacekeepers in 
the area could not immediately confirm the report. 
</P>
<P>
	Beta quoted a peacekeeper as saying it was a security measure  
against possible attacks by the KLA.

<HEADLINE> Gene Study Links Whales and Hippos </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- One has no legs and swims in the ocean, and  
the other has four legs and lives in rivers, but a genetic study 
shows that the whale and the hippo are close relatives in 
evolutionary history. 
</P>
<P>
	The study, by researchers at the Tokyo Institute of Technology  
in Japan and Pennsylvania State University at University Park, Pa., 
compared gene sequences from the minke whale, the sperm whale and 
the hippopotamus. It found the diverse animals share a sequence of 
genes inherited from an ancient common ancestor. 
</P>
<P>
	A report of the study appears Tuesday in the Proceedings of the  
National Academy of Sciences. 
</P>
<P>
	The study found that the camel, pig, giraffe, sheep and cow  
share some gene sequences with the whale and hippo, indicating that 
far back in time all had a common ancestor, according to evolution 
theory. The animals diverged genetically. A gene sequence found 
only in whales and the hippo show that they share a common ancestor 
that was not part of the evolutionary history of the other animals.

<P>
	Until 1985, it was generally thought that pigs were more closely  
related to whales. Other genetic studies since have suggested the 
whale-hippo link. The new study, researchers say, confirms that the 
hippo is the closest living relative to the whale. 
</P>
<P>
	The genetic analysis was conducted by Masato Nikaido and  
Norihiro Okada of the Tokyo Institute and by Alejandro Rooney of 
Penn State. 
</P>
<P>
	It has long been believed that the whale's ancient ancestor was  
a land animal. It is thought that a lineage leading to the modern 
whale returned to the sea and evolved into a group of marine 
mammals called cetacean. Along the way, hind legs were lost, and 
forelegs were replaced by flippers. 
</P>
<P>
	David Hillis of the University of Texas, in a PNAS commentary,  
said whales and hippos share several adaptations, including the 
lack of hair and oil-producing skin glands, and the ability to 
communicate and to nurse offspring under water.

<HEADLINE> IMF Loans to Russia Said OK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Contrary to suspicions of the House Banking  
Committee chairman, the International Monetary Fund says it has 
seen no evidence that its loans to Russia have been illegally 
diverted through U.S. banks. 
</P>
<P>
	A senior IMF official said Monday that the international lending  
agency already has put tight controls in place to prevent siphoning 
off of its loans. 
</P>
<P>
	The comments by Tom Dawson, the IMF's director of external  
affairs, followed a statement by the chairman of the House Banking 
Committee that IMF loans to Russia should be halted until controls 
are put in place to prevent diversions of the sort that reportedly 
have occurred through Bank of New York. 
</P>
<P>
	``We continue to have absolutely no indication of any IMF money  
having been diverted'' through Bank of New York or other U.S. 
banks, Dawson told reporters in a conference call. Nonetheless, he 
added, ``We continue to take the allegations seriously.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Banking Committee chairman, Rep. Jim Leach, R-Iowa, spoke  
Friday amid concern that some of the $10 billion or so allegedly 
funneled through the bank by Russian gangsters in a 
money-laundering scheme may have involved IMF loans to Russia. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal authorities are investigating whether there was a  
diversion of IMF loans or of U.S. credits extended to the Russian 
government for buying grain, corn and other farm products. 
</P>
<P>
	An IMF team has been in Russia for several days reviewing a $4.5  
billion loan and is scheduled to return at the end of the week, 
Dawson noted. He said the IMF's board of directors likely will 
review the money-laundering allegations at some point when it 
considers approving the second loan installment, for $640 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``We believe we are being open and transparent in terms of  
what's been going on,'' Dawson said. ``We just don't believe there 
are any grounds for this particular accusation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At the Russian government's request, auditing firm  
PricewaterhouseCoopers has been conducting a study for the IMF of 
possible manipulations of loan money by Russia's central bank, 
Dawson noted. He said the IMF had previously instituted tight 
controls, keeping the loan money at the international fund rather 
than transferring it to the central bank. 
</P>
<P>
	The study was prompted by an earlier audit by the accounting  
firm that found the central bank in 1996 funneled $1.2 billion in 
IMF money to a company it controlled in the Channel Islands off 
Britain. The money transfer made Russia's financial picture look 
more favorable than it was when President Boris Yeltsin was running 
for re-election, thereby misleading the IMF, agency officials have 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	However, another PricewaterhouseCoopers audit, completed earlier  
this month, concluded there was no evidence the central bank 
misused $4.8 billion it received from the IMF in July 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	The money was used partly in an unsuccessful attempt to prop up  
Russia's currency, the ruble.

<HEADLINE>  Dennis' Retreats From N.C. Coast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NAGS HEAD, N.C. (AP) -- People along the North Carolina coast  
breathed a sigh of relief Monday as Hurricane Dennis turned out to 
sea, sideswiping the shoreline with 112 mph gusts and a deluge that 
flooded streets and left tens of thousands without power. 
</P>
<P>
	The storm's center started peeling away from the coast after  
getting no closer than 60 miles. Two traffic deaths early Monday 
were blamed on the storm. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are hoping it continues that offshore track,'' said Jim  
Jones, spokesman for the state Division of Emergency Management. 
``If it stalls far enough away, that's fine, as long as it doesn't 
come back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Storm damage was light. New Hanover's losses totaled $217,000,  
while in Brunswick County, the collapse of a beachfront house at 
Ocean Isle Beach was the worst property damage reported, said Cecil 
Logan of the county emergency management office. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've seen a bunch of bad weather in this area, but we're real  
happy with how things turned out this time.'' said Bob Sheppard, an 
employee at Harbor Inn in Wrightsville Beach. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a dodged bullet,'' said Susan Rogers, who spent Sunday  
night on Wrightsville Beach. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, forecasters warned the danger wasn't over. Jerry Jarrell  
of the National Hurricane Center in Miami said experts believe 
Dennis will stall at sea Tuesday for three or four days. What it 
does after that is anyone's guess. 
</P>
<P>
	``Unfortunately, one of our better models is showing that it  
comes back into the coast, not far from where it is right now, 
close to Norfolk or in that general vicinity,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Over the weekend Dennis moved on a plodding course parallel to  
the coasts of the Carolinas. Tens of thousands of residents and 
tourists were evacuated from the barrier islands separated from the 
mainland by roads that get swamped in storms. The worst of the 
storm hit early Monday, churning up 30-foot seas. 
</P>
<P>
	Innkeeper Bob Touhey on Ocracoke Island, on North Carolina's  
Outer Banks, said: ``We have no power. Our water's off.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said a friend's wind gauge ``got stuck at 74 mph before it  
blew off the house.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At 8 p.m, Dennis was 120 miles east of Cape Hatteras, moving  
toward the east-northeast at 17 mph with 90 mph winds. A hurricane 
warning remained in effect for most of the North Carolina 
coastline, from Cape Lookout to the Virginia border, but winds were 
starting to abate Monday evening. 
</P>
<P>
	As it crept northward, powerful winds and downpours lashed the  
Wilmington area and other beaches on the southeastern coast of 
North Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
	For a time, it seemed yet another hurricane might cross Cape  
Fear, directly south of Wilmington, just like Bertha and Fran in 
1996 and Bonnie in 1998. Bertha killed 25 people and caused up to 
$6 billion in damage. 
</P>
<P>
	Shortly before noon, as Dennis approached the Outer Banks --  
which stick out from the Atlantic Seaboard like the sideview mirror 
on a car -- it began edging away from the coast. 
</P>
<P>
	Two people were killed in a head-on collision in the coastal  
community of Richlands as 60 mph gusts and 2 inches of rain blasted 
the area. In St. Augustine Beach, Fla., a 45-year-old surfer 
apparently drown in heavy waves caused by Dennis, officials said. 
The man's body was found early Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Southport, south of Wilmington, received 8 inches of rain.  
Sustained winds of 92 mph and gusts of 112 mph were reported at 
Frying Pan Shoals, south of Wilmington. 
</P>
<P>
	The storm knocked out power to more than 50,000 people as far  
inland as the Raleigh area. In southeast Virginia, 22,500 customers 
were without electricity. 
</P>
<P>
	On Hatteras Island, the ocean washed over N.C. 12, closing the  
only highway along the narrow barrier island. A stretch of the road 
was shut down near Kitty Hawk, too. 
</P>
<P>
	Bob and Mary Cantrell rode out the storm in their Wrightsville  
Beach cottage. He said he's not ready to become a mainlander. 
</P>
<P>
	``At the end of the day, we can take a walk on the beach and  
watch the sun set,'' he said. ``But each time one of these storms 
come, it eats away at my desire a little bit.''

<HEADLINE> Anti-Drug Chief Eyes Collaborators </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The administration's top counternarcotics  
official said Monday that he supports Senate-passed legislation to 
impose sanctions against foreign individuals and companies who 
cooperate with drug chieftains. 
</P>
<P>
	Barry McCaffrey, head of the White House Office of National Drug  
Control Policy, said U.S. counterdrug strategy has focused too much 
on governments and not enough on those who collaborate with drug 
kingpins. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's about time for the United States to stop talking about  
our problems with the government of Mexico, Peru, et cetera, and 
start talking about our problems with individuals and businesses 
who are involved in drug-related crime and hold those people 
responsible for their actions,'' said McCaffrey, who recently 
visited Brazil, Bolivia, Peru and Argentina. 
</P>
<P>
	A House-Senate conference committee will work out the final  
shape of the legislation, which would authorize the president to 
take a series of measures against foreign companies or individuals 
linked to the drug trade. 
</P>
<P>
	The sanctions include barring U.S. citizens from doing business  
with such companies or individuals and freezing their U.S. assets. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the bill's cosponsors are Sens. Paul Coverdell, R-Ga.,  
chairman of the Foreign Relations subcommittee on Western 
Hemisphere affairs, Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., and Mike DeWine, 
R-Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
	The legislation expands a 4-year-old presidential order aimed at  
Colombian drug traffickers. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill has generated concern in Mexico that innocent people  
could be misidentified as collaborators with drug chieftains. 
McCaffrey acknowledged this was a concern and said safeguards must 
be written into the law to prevent such abuses. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite his reservations, McCaffrey said he finds the proposal  
to be ``enormously compelling.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Under the legislation, the Treasury Department would develop a  
list foreign traffickers active in any of the 28 countries listed 
as major drug source or drug transit countries. The sanctions would 
carry penalties of up to $500,000 per violation for corporations or 
$250,000 for individuals, as well as 10 years in prison.

<HEADLINE> ABC News Lures Jack Ford from NBC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- ABC News has lured Jack Ford from NBC to be a  
host and correspondent on ``20/20,'' where he will be a leading 
candidate to replace Charles Gibson on ``Good Morning America.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ford has been the chief legal correspondent at NBC and co-anchor  
of the ``Today'' show weekend editions. 
</P>
<P>
	He will report legal and other stories and anchor one night a  
week for ``20/20,'' a newsmagazine. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford will also sub regularly on ``GMA,'' where Gibson returned  
hurriedly as host in January to stop a ratings free fall. Gibson 
said he will stay with the morning show through the spring. 
</P>
<P>
	Both Ford and ABC News spokeswoman Eileen Murphy said no  
promises had been made that Ford will inherit Gibson's job. But 
Ford said it's an attractive position. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you said to anybody in the business, `would you like to be  
anchor of `Good Morning America?' they would say, `absolutely,''' 
he said on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	A former prosecutor in Monmouth County, New Jersey, Ford began a  
television career as a legal commentator at New York's WCBS-TV in 
1983. He was an anchor at Court TV from 1991 until 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	He'll leave ``Today'' following Saturday's edition. Sarah James  
and John Siegenthaler will be among the temporary co-hosts with 
Soledad O'Brien on ``Today'' until a permanent replacement is named 
for Ford. 
</P>
<P>
	NBC is expected to announce soon that it has hired a defector  
from ABC. Forrest Sawyer, who left ABC this summer, will sign on as 
a substitute anchor at various NBC shows, said an executive at the 
network who requested anonymity.

<HEADLINE> Bush Named in Free Speech Lawsuit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUSTIN, Texas (AP) -- Gov. George W. Bush was accused in a  
lawsuit filed Monday of violating the free speech rights of 
protesters. His lawyers, meanwhile, persuaded a judge to quash a 
subpoena in another legal matter. 
</P>
<P>
	Environmentalists allege that the Republican presidential  
front-runner has given state troopers ``unbridled discretion'' to 
target protesters picketing on a public sidewalk in front of the 
Governor's Mansion. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Texas Constitution does not stop at the sidewalk in front  
of the Governor's Mansion,'' said Rick Abraham, executive director 
of Texans United, one of the environmental groups suing Bush. 
Abraham said he was arrested twice. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush's office contends the protesters were arrested because they  
failed to remain within the area set aside for demonstrations. 
</P>
<P>
	``The decision regarding protesters was made by the Department  
of Public Safety to protect the safety of pedestrians and 
protesters around the governor's mansion,'' said Bush spokesman Ray 
Sullivan. 
</P>
<P>
	``They were concerned that protesters blocking sidewalks could  
result in people walking in the street or otherwise jeopardizing 
their safety,'' Sullivan said. 
</P>
<P>
	In the other case, District Judge John Dietz quashed a subpoena  
seeking Bush's testimony in a whistleblower case filed by a former 
head of the Texas Funeral Service Commission. 
</P>
<P>
	Attorney General John Cornyn had argued that Bush should not be  
forced to testify. ``This is not a search for the truth. This is 
about harassment. This is about politics,'' he told the judge. 
</P>
<P>
	Eliza May alleges that she was fired as head of the funeral  
commission over an investigation of Service Corp. International, a 
Houston-based funeral company that had given campaign contributions 
to Bush. Her lawyers want to question Bush about the investigation, 
which resulted in recommended fines of $445,000. 
</P>
<P>
	The company denies wrongdoing and says the commission  
misinterpreted state embalming law. It is contesting the fines. 
</P>
<P>
	Cornyn said the state government is sued 10 times a day, and if  
the governor were forced to testify in each one he would have no 
time for anything else. 
</P>
<P>
	``This ruling is an important one for Governor Bush and for  
future governors because it essentially says that the governor 
should not be used to generate publicity for lawsuits in which he 
is not involved,'' spokesman Sullivan said. 
</P>
<P>
	Chuck Herring, representing Ms. May, said Bush ``is not ...  
simply an uninvolved third party.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The governor is alleged here ... as a co-conspirator in this  
matter, in this very case,'' he said. ``That means he and he alone 
could have personal knowledge of the elements of the conspiracy 
that we need to ask about.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said he would push forward with the case and question others,  
including the governor's chief of staff and his general counsel. 
``Obviously, this is not about getting Governor Bush,'' he said. 
``This is a a whistleblower lawsuit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Said Cornyn, ``We finally got some relief from the kind of  
innuendo and rumor and speculation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The defendants in the case are the funeral commission, SCI and  
Robert Waltrip, the company's founder and chairman, who is a 
longtime Bush supporter. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. May, a former Democratic Party treasurer, alleges that SCI,  
whose political action committee gave Bush $35,000 in 1996 and 
1997, worked with Bush's staff to interfere with an investigation 
of the company. 
</P>
<P>
	She has asked the court to find Bush in contempt for filing what  
she calls a false affidavit in his attempt to block a subpoena. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush said in his July 20 affidavit, ``I have had no  
conversations with SCI officials, agents, or representatives 
concerning the investigation or any dispute arising from it.'' He 
also said he had no personal knowledge of the case. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit filed on behalf of the environmentalists seeks to  
force the state to acknowledge the demonstrators' right to protest 
in front of the Governor's Mansion. It was filled by Texans United, 
Downwinders At Risk and three demonstrators against Bush, the 
Department of Public Safety and the three DPS commissioners. 
</P>
<P>
	A group of about 20 demonstrators paced the sidewalk in front of  
the mansion Monday afternoon without incident. It was the same area 
where demonstrators had been arrested on four previous occasion -- 
March 11, March 29, April 19 and May 25. In each case, charges of 
blocking an entry way were dropped by the Travis County's district 
attorney's office. 
</P>
<P>
	``What is clear about this pattern of arrests is that it was  
designed to intimidate and harass protesters, not to keep the 
sidewalks clear of pedestrians,'' said David Kahne, an attorney 
with the American Civil Liberties Union. 
</P>
<P>
	Abraham, one of the plaintiffs, contended that the arrests  
started after Bush decided to run for president. 
</P>
<P>
	Tom Vinger, DPS spokesman, declined comment on the lawsuit, but  
said there is no written policy on how state police should deal 
with protesters. He said protests are considered on a case-by-case 
basis.

<HEADLINE>  Seahawks' Fritz Shurmur Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GREEN BAY, Wis. (AP) -- Seattle Seahawks defensive coordinator  
Fritz Shurmur, the architect of the Green Bay Packers' defense that 
dominated the league in 1996, died today at age 67. 
</P>
<P>
	Shurmur was in his 20th year as an NFL defensive coordinator. He  
followed Mike Holmgren to Seattle in January when Holmgren was 
hired as the Seahawks' coach and GM. 
</P>
<P>
	He returned to the Green Bay area for treatment of esophageal  
and liver cancer, which was found during a routine checkup in May. 
Shurmur died at his home in nearby Suamico. 
</P>
<P>
	Shurmur's death was first reported today by The Post-Crescent of  
Appleton and confirmed by a team source who spoke on condition of 
anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	Shurmur spent five seasons with the Packers and was instrumental  
in the team's run to consecutive Super Bowl appearances. He also 
served as a defensive coach with the Phoenix Cardinals, the Los 
Angeles Rams, the New England Patriots and the Detroit Lions. 
</P>
<P>
	Shurmur joined the Packers in 1994, replacing current Green Bay  
head coach Ray Rhodes as defensive coordinator. 
</P>
<P>
	Shurmur was the league's longest-serving defensive coordinator.  
He was the Rams' defensive coordinator from 1983-90 and spent three 
years in Phoenix before joining the Packers.

<HEADLINE>  Seahawks' Fritz Shurmur Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GREEN BAY, Wis. (AP) -- Seattle Seahawks defensive coordinator  
Fritz Shurmur, the architect of the Green Bay Packers' defense that 
dominated the league in 1996, died today at age 67. 
</P>
<P>
	Shurmur was in his 20th year as an NFL defensive coordinator. He  
followed Mike Holmgren to Seattle in January when Holmgren was 
hired as the Seahawks' coach and GM. 
</P>
<P>
	He returned to the Green Bay area for treatment of esophageal  
and liver cancer, which was found during a routine checkup in May. 
Shurmur died at his home in nearby Suamico. 
</P>
<P>
	Shurmur's death was first reported today by The Post-Crescent of  
Appleton and confirmed by a team source who spoke on condition of 
anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	Shurmur spent five seasons with the Packers and was instrumental  
in the team's run to consecutive Super Bowl appearances. He also 
served as a defensive coach with the Phoenix Cardinals, the Los 
Angeles Rams, the New England Patriots and the Detroit Lions. 
</P>
<P>
	Shurmur joined the Packers in 1994, replacing current Green Bay  
head coach Ray Rhodes as defensive coordinator. 
</P>
<P>
	Shurmur was the league's longest-serving defensive coordinator.  
He was the Rams' defensive coordinator from 1983-90 and spent three 
years in Phoenix before joining the Packers. 
</P>
<P>
	Shurmur was known as a defensive innovator and a premiere  
teacher of the game. He wrote four books on defense and coached for 
his entire adult life, beginning in 1954 as a graduate assistant at 
his alma mater, Albion (Mich.) College.

<HEADLINE> Soybeans, Corn Up; Wheat Down / Board of Trade  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Soybean and corn futures prices were up slightly  
or unchanged in early dealings on the Chicago Board of Trade, while 
wheat futures fell. 
</P>
<P>
	Soybean prices, which ended on a high note Friday, got continued  
support from forecasts for dry weather in much of the Midwest 
growing region through the weekend, which could result in smaller 
crops. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts say corn prices should stay fairly steady as traders  
await crop estimates from the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Crops 
will be harvested in the next few weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts say wheat prices were getting pressure from low export  
demand. 
</P>
<P>
	In early dealings today, wheat for December delivery fell a cent  
to $2.78 1/2 a bushel; December corn rose a cent to $2.16 1/4 a bushel; 
December oats were unchanged at $1.14 a bushel; November soybeans 
also broke even at $4.70 3/4 a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
	Livestock and meet futures prices were mostly lower in early  
trading on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	October live cattle rose .12 cent to 66.67 cents a pound;  
October feeder cattle were up .08 cent to 79 cents a pound; October 
lean hogs fell .32 cent to 44.65 cents a pound; February pork 
bellies fell .35 cents to 58.30 cents a pound.

<HEADLINE>  Browns' Spielman May Retire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BEREA, Ohio (AP) -- When the Cleveland Browns signed him, Chris  
Spielman gave them his word. He promised if he couldn't play at an 
acceptable level, he would hand in his jersey and walk away from 
football without shedding a tear. 
</P>
<P>
	That day might have arrived prematurely for No. 54.  
</P>
<P>
	Spielman, the Browns' intense middle linebacker attempting a  
comeback from neck fusion surgery in 1997, could announce his 
retirement today after sustaining a second ``stinger'' in his 
surgically repaired neck following a violent hit in an exhibition 
game on Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
	The Browns scheduled a 2 p.m. news conference at their  
headquarters to discuss Spielman's status. 
</P>
<P>
	Spielman suffered temporary paralysis after being blindsided by  
Bears center Casey Wiegmann during the Browns' 35-24 win over 
Chicago. The 33-year-old Spielman was helped from the field after 
the collision and taken to the Cleveland Clinic for an MRI. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the second time during the preseason that Spielman has  
had to undergo tests following a ferocious hit. On the first day of 
training camp, he and fullback Tarek Saleh had a helmet-to-helmet 
collision that initially gave Spielman second thoughts about his 
comeback. 
</P>
<P>
	After the most recent hit, Spielman, an Ohio football icon, is  
again contemplating retirement. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's exploring all of his options,'' said Browns coach Chris  
Palmer, who spoke to Spielman twice on Sunday. ``He's trying to 
think things out. He's looking at things from different sides. He's 
going to look at everything and go from there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Palmer wouldn't go so far as to say if he recommended to  
Spielman that the 10-year veteran should retire. However, Palmer 
intimated all that may be left for Spielman to do was announce his 
career was over. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's some things that have to be ironed out, discussed,  
looked at,'' said Palmer, who was visibly shaken after Saturday's 
game. ``I think once that's all done, I think we'll be in pretty 
good shape.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After speaking with Spielman over the phone early Sunday morning  
from the hospital, Palmer said the two visited again at 8 a.m. in 
Palmer's office. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had a good conversation,'' Palmer said. ``It was very  
candid. It was a situation that he expressed some things to me, I 
expressed some things to him that will remain private. That's 
between the coach and the player. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wanted a clear mind in the morning to talk to him. I think  
he had a clear mind and came in and talked to me. The fact we 
talked man-to-man and eye-to-eye is real good.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Spielman was unavailable for comment on Sunday.  
</P>
<P>
	Defending a screen play in the first quarter against the Bears,  
Spielman shed and spun off one blocker, but as he turned and before 
he could get his feet planted, Wiegmann buried him. 
</P>
<P>
	Spielman stayed on the ground for several moments, and later  
told Cleveland offensive tackle Lomas Brown, who also played with 
him in Detroit, that he had been momentarily paralyzed. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's scary,'' Brown said. ``I don't want to tell him what to  
do, but I think he should have a long talk with his wife Stefanie 
and think about what he wants to do. Life is more important that 
football.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wiegmann offered Spielman some assistance after the play.  
</P>
<P>
	``I thought I hit him good, but I didn't think I did that,''  
Wiegmann said. ``He looked me right in the eye, and I was going to 
help him up but he said to me he didn't want to get up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Spielman had two vertebrae fused in his neck in 1997 while he  
was with the Buffalo Bills. He missed the final eight games that 
season, and was prepared to come back last year. 
</P>
<P>
	But he put his playing career on hold to care for his family  
after his wife underwent breast cancer surgery. Stefanie is now 
cancer-free. 
</P>
<P>
	The Plain Dealer reported today that Spielman's father, Sonny  
Spielman, said that if asked he would advise his son to retire as a 
player. He said Chris Spielman has a lot to consider, such as his 
wife's battle with cancer and the ability to help care for his 
children. 
</P>
<P>
	``If the cancer recurs, you don't want to have a mom battling  
cancer and a dad in a wheelchair,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Browns signed him to a three-year contract in February, and  
Spielman instantly became the expansion team's most popular player 
because of his Ohio roots as a high school star at Massillon and 
All-America at Ohio State. 
</P>
<P>
	Spielman has always played every down as if it was his last, and  
the toll of more than 20 years of punishment may have finally 
caught up to him. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's nobody playing this game that's 50 years old,'' Palmer  
said. ``You only have so many blocks, so many tackles in your body, 
and the guy upstairs says it's time to sit back and watch somebody 
else play. That happens sometimes when you're 18, sometimes when 
you're 22 or 35. But it happens.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If Spielman's career is over, the Browns are losing more than  
just an inside linebacker, Palmer said. Their losing a player with 
an unparalleled work ethic who leads by example. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's one of a kind,'' Palmer said. ``He's a guy that owes  
everything to football. He's a guy that respects the game, has a 
passion for the game. His family is in football, he probably grew 
up with a football on the kitchen table.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Taken in the second round of the 1988 draft by Detroit, Spielman  
spent his first eight seasons with the Lions before signing as a 
free agent with Buffalo in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	A four-time Pro Bowl selection, he's made 1,441 tackles with 10  
sacks and six interceptions in 10 seasons. He has started in all 
148 he has played.

<HEADLINE> French Retailers Plan Merger </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PARIS (AP) -- French supermarket group Carrefour SA is buying  
rival Promodes in a $16.3 billion stock deal to create the world's 
second-largest retailer behind Wal-Mart Stores Inc. of the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
	The combined operation will have a market capitalization of $49  
billion and annual sales of nearly $50 billion, much smaller than 
Wal-Mart, which had sales of $138 billion last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Carrefour is offering six shares for one of Promodes, a  
statement from both companies said today. 
</P>
<P>
	The offer was announced by Carrefour President Daniel Bernard  
and Promodes President Paul-Louis Halley at a joint news conference 
in Paris. 
</P>
<P>
	Wal-Mart's expansion into the United Kingdom and Europe has put  
pressure on European retailers. The Bentonville, Ark.-based 
company, which owns 95 stores in Germany and 229 stores in the 
United Kingdom, is expected to target France soon. 
</P>
<P>
	Wal-Mart spokesman Mike Maher declined to comment on the  
Carrefour-Promodes deal, or ``on any speculation about our business 
in Europe.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Halley said that ``taking into account the speed of  
consolidation in the retail sector, this linkup comes at the right 
time, and is without doubt the best possible for each of the two 
companies.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Halley, whose family has 52.7 percent of Promodes' voting  
rights, said he has recommended that Promodes shareholders support 
Carrefour's offer. 
</P>
<P>
	Promodes is a leading food retailer in Europe, with its strength  
in Spain. Carrefour operates superstores selling everything from 
food to clothes to car batteries. It is strong in Asia and Latin 
America. 
</P>
<P>
	The combined group would operate in 26 countries with 9,000  
stores, including 680 superstores and 2,600 supermarkets. It will 
employ 240,000 people, about half in France. 
</P>
<P>
	The fusion of Carrefour and Promodes is the latest example of  
merger mania that has gripped France this year, particularly in the 
banking and oil sectors.

<HEADLINE> French Retailers Plan Merger </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PARIS (AP) -- French supermarket group Carrefour said Monday it  
was acquiring rival Promodes in a deal that would create the 
world's second-largest retailer and a European challenge to 
Wal-Mart Stores Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	The friendly stock deal valued at about $16.3 billion was  
expected to prompt similar mergers across Europe, where retailers 
are scrambling to find partners as Wal-Mart seeks to expand on the 
Continent. 
</P>
<P>
	The combined operation will have a market capitalization of  
about $49 billion and annual sales of more than $50 billion. But it 
will still be much smaller than Wal-Mart, which had sales of $139.2 
billion in 1998 and is expected to easily surpass that figure this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	Carrefour said its offer of six Carrefour shares for each  
Promodes share represents a premium of around 20 percent on 
Friday's closing price. 
</P>
<P>
	Both companies are primarily food retailers, with several  
well-known supermarket chains. They also operate so-called 
hypermarkets, which sell everything from Camembert to car 
batteries. 
</P>
<P>
	The combined group would operate in 26 countries with 9,000  
stores, including 680 superstores and 2,600 supermarkets. It will 
employ 240,000 people, about half in France. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts have mentioned both Carrefour and Promodes as potential  
acquisition targets for Wal-Mart. The U.S. retailer, based in 
Bentonville, Ark., has already made two acquisitions in Germany and 
most recently bought the British supermarket chain Asda Group. 
</P>
<P>
	``Carrefour and Promodes were certainly reacting defensively to  
Wal-Mart's Asda purchase,'' said Hughes de la Presle, analyst for 
Standard &AMP; Poor's in Paris. 
</P>
<P>
	The Carrefour-Promodes combination is the latest in a series of  
mergers in France this year, particularly in the banking and oil 
sectors. 
</P>
<P>
	Other European supermarket chains, including the Dutch retailer  
Royal Ahold, have also said they are looking for a partner, and 
analysts said the French deal will accelerate the merger activity. 
</P>
<P>
	Wal-Mart spokesman Mike Maher declined to comment on the  
Carrefour-Promodes deal, or ``on any speculation about our business 
in Europe.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Carrefour and Promodes both began as family run companies, but  
have actively sought expansion abroad in recent years. Carrefour 
has a strong presence in Asia and Latin America, while Promodes has 
focused on Europe, particularly in southern countries. 
</P>
<P>
	Promodes has long sought to tie the knot with a French partner.  
In 1997, it launched and ultimately lost a hostile takeover bid for 
the French food retailer Casino Guichard Perrachon and Cie.

<HEADLINE> ABC News Lures Jack Ford from NBC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- ABC News has lured Jack Ford from NBC, where he  
will be a host and correspondent on ``20/20'' and immediately 
becomes a leading candidate to replace Charles Gibson on ``Good 
Morning America.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ford has been the chief legal correspondent at NBC and co-anchor  
of the ``Today'' show weekend editions. 
</P>
<P>
	He will report legal and other stories and anchor one night a  
week ``20/20,'' a newsmagazine. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford will also sub regularly on ``GMA,'' where Gibson returned  
hurriedly as host in January to stop a ratings free fall. Gibson 
said he will stay with the morning show through the spring. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> CDC: AIDS Deaths on Decline </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- A sharp decline in AIDS deaths since 1995 has  
only widened the gap between how the disease affects blacks -- who 
now make up nearly half those killed by AIDS -- and other racial 
groups. 
</P>
<P>
	New figures released by the Centers For Disease Control and  
Prevention show that AIDS killed 17,047 people in the United States 
last year -- a 20 percent decline from 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	But the more deaths have dropped, the more blacks with AIDS move  
toward becoming the majority of those who die, the CDC said Monday 
during the first National HIV Prevention Conference. 
</P>
<P>
	A total of 8,316 blacks died from AIDS last year. That means 49  
percent of total AIDS deaths came from a group that makes up only 
13 percent of the U.S. population. 
</P>
<P>
	Health officials say they fear the ramifications if AIDS -- once  
misunderstood as a gay disease -- now becomes viewed as an illness 
that affects mostly blacks. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's real disturbing,'' said Dr. Helene Gayle, director of  
HIV prevention at the CDC. ``We know that often times, if a disease 
becomes higher in populations that are more marginalized in our 
society, we forget about those problems. We can't afford to forget 
about HIV.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Thirty-two percent of AIDS deaths in 1998 were among whites, for  
a total of 5,436. Among Hispanics there were 3,114 deaths, or 18 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Health officials have long blamed poverty and a lack of access  
to health care for higher rates of disease among blacks. But many 
blacks also have failed to realize that they are at risk as much as 
other groups, Gayle said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The fact that this was portrayed as a white, gay disease  
lulled the African-American community into a false state of 
security,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	After peaking at 49,351 in 1995, AIDS deaths dropped 65 percent  
through 1998. Deaths among Hispanics dropped at the same rate. But 
for whites the decline was much greater -- 75 percent. For blacks it 
was much less, at 55 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The numbers released Monday also showed that, although total  
AIDS deaths continue to drop, the rate of decline has been cut by 
more than half. 
</P>
<P>
	This raises concerns that powerful new drugs may have reached  
their limit in controlling the disease. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, researchers were stunned by reports that AIDS deaths  
nationwide dropped 42 percent from 1996 to 1997, results that were 
credited to powerful drug cocktails that dramatically increase the 
life expectancy of AIDS patients. 
</P>
<P>
	But the decline in deaths slowed to 20 percent from 1997 to  
1998. 
</P>
<P>
	CDC officials said it's too early to tell if the current  
treatments have pushed AIDS deaths as low as they can go. One 
worrisome sign is that the decline in deaths last year occurred 
mostly in the first three months of 1998. After that, deaths 
leveled off for the rest of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	``We might continue to see that decline,'' Gayle said. ``But it  
is at least a concern that most ... declines were in the first 
quarter of 1998 and not in the last quarter.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some advocates pointed to the CDC's numbers as proof that the  
drugs aren't as effective as once hoped. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our worst fears have become a tragic reality,'' said Steven  
Fisher of the advocacy group AIDS Action. ``AIDS drugs don't work 
for everyone and aren't a cure for anyone.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The CDC blamed the slowdown on three factors:  
</P>
<P>
	-- Some people still aren't getting tested and treated for AIDS.  
</P>
<P>
	-- Some are finding it difficult to stick to the complicated  
regimen of pills, which must be taken at certain times of the day, 
sometimes with food, sometimes without. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Drug-resistant strains of the virus are emerging as patients  
fail to keep on schedule with their medicine. 
</P>
<P>
	The CDC estimates there as many as 900,000 people infected with  
HIV in the United States, with new infections holding steady at 
roughly 40,000 a year for the last decade.

<HEADLINE> Survey: Most College Athletes Hazed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- From binge drinking to beatings, freshman  
initiation to college sports isn't much different from the old 
fraternity rites. A study released Monday reported that 80 percent 
of college athletes are hazed, a finding that startled officials 
and left them looking for answers. 
</P>
<P>
	``I find the results of our study on hazing to be horrifying,''  
Alfred University president Edward Coll said. ``It's pervasive. 
It's dangerous, and it is behavior that is forced upon student 
athletes as the price of admission to a team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the first attempt to gauge the problem on a national basis,  
the upstate New York university surveyed 10,000 student-athletes, 
3,000 coaches and more than 1,000 other athletic officials from 
NCAA colleges and universities. 
</P>
<P>
	The study, called the National Survey of Initiation Rites and  
Athletics and conducted with cooperation of the NCAA, found 
widespread hazing from Division I to Division III and in a wide 
variety of sports. Examples ranged from criminal or dangerous acts, 
such as kidnappings and destruction of property, to questionable 
acts such as yelling and cursing at freshmen or forcing them to 
wear embarrassing clothing. 
</P>
<P>
	Sixty percent of the athletes who responded said they took part  
in criminal, dangerous and-or alcohol-related hazing. 
</P>
<P>
	Other than the sheer size of the problem, the most surprising  
result for the researchers was that hazing was not the most 
prevalent among big-money, scholarship sports at Division I 
schools. 
</P>
<P>
	``That was a really astonishing thing to us,'' said Nadine  
Hoover, the study's principal investigator, ``because we expected 
to find places where this was much more prevalent. There is no 
significant difference between divisions or levels of teams.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The one exception, said Hoover, was that Division I scholarship  
athletes were more likely to be subject to alcohol-related hazing. 
</P>
<P>
	The study also found that men were more at risk than women, and  
that the sports with the most hazing are swimming and diving, 
lacrosse, soccer, football and ice hockey. Hazing was also more 
likely in the East or South, and on rural or residential campuses. 
</P>
<P>
	Sports with significantly fewer reports of hazing were track,  
fencing and golf. 
</P>
<P>
	Coll said he asked for the study after criminal charges were  
filed last year against four Alfred football players following a 
party at which freshmen were allegedly tied together and forced to 
drink alcohol or water until they vomited. 
</P>
<P>
	As a result, Coll said his university has taken a zero-tolerance  
policy toward hazing in athletics and called on other schools to do 
the same. He said coaches specifically need to stop ignoring the 
problem. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the coaches turn a blind eye toward it because many of  
them don't think supervising their student-athletes outside their 
practice or game-day procedures is a part of their 
responsibility,'' Coll said. ``I think this is an issue we need to 
address to let coaches know that we do expect some 
accountability.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The coaches have a specific role to fulfill here, whether they  
like it or not,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ron Stratten, the NCAA's vice president for education services,  
also called for coaches to be more aware of their teams' initiation 
rites. He said the NCAA has planned no specific legislation in 
response to the study, but will address the issue with the 
colleges. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to raise the bar with regard to our knowledge of  
his issue,'' Stratten said. ``It's appalling what's going on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The study defined hazing as ``any activity expected of someone  
joining a group that humiliates, degrades, abuses or endangers, 
regardless of the person's willingness to participate. This does 
not include activities such as rookies carrying the balls, team 
parties with community games, or going out with your teammates, 
unless an atmosphere of humiliation, degradation, abuse or danger 
arises.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Under this definition, only 12 percent of athletes said they had  
been hazed. However, when asked about specific activities, the 
figure rose to 79 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The study also explored ways for schools to stop hazing.  
Recommended solutions include written antihazing policies, more 
coach involvement and the development of positive, team-sponsored 
initiation events that could take the place of private ones. 
</P>
<P>
	The study did not address the causes of hazing, but Coll said  
the answer lies in tradition. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hazing exists because it was done before,'' he said. ``That's  
the only logical explanation I've ever had for Greek (fraternity) 
hazing. The sophomores and juniors do it because it was done to 
them when they were freshmen.''

<HEADLINE> Siblings Take Rivalry to the Sky </HEADLINE>

<P>
	PANAMA CITY, Fla. (AP) -- Air Force pilots Ken and Katie Ekman  
have taken their sibling rivalry to the skies. 
</P>
<P>
	The pair, who are in separate squadrons, faced off last month  
during an exercise off the Korean coast, making them what is 
believed to be the first brother and sister fighter pilots to meet 
in a mock dogfight. 
</P>
<P>
	Katie, 25, a first lieutenant, flies F-15 Eagles with the 67th  
Fighter Squadron at Kadena Air Base in Japan. Ken, 30, a captain, 
pilots F-16 Fighting Falcons with the 36th Fighter Squadron at Osan 
Air Base in South Korea. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither side is saying who won.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not all that interested in sorting out who shot who,'' Ken

	Both are following in the footsteps of their father, retired  
Col. Leonard Ekman, who flew Air Force fighters during the Vietnam 
War.

<P>
	Their mother, a high school guidance counselor, said there has  
been no bragging by either one.

<HEADLINE> Finances Eyed in Gingrich Divorce </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA, Ga. (AP) -- Newt Gingrich has asked a judge to settle  
his divorce by relying on a financial agreement he and his wife 
worked out during a six-year separation that began when the former 
House Speaker came back to an empty home. 
</P>
<P>
	``All she left was a television and a guest bed,'' Thomas  
Browning, Gingrich's divorce attorney, said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gingrich filed for divorce July 29 amid allegations he is having  
an affair with 33-year-old congressional aide Callista Bisek. 
</P>
<P>
	Documents related to the divorce filed Friday in Cobb County  
Superior Court include a separation agreement signed by the couple 
and notarized in December 1987. There is no indication it was ever 
filed. 
</P>
<P>
	Browning said Marianne Gingrich called her husband on his  
birthday in June 1987 to tell him she was leaving him. Gingrich, he 
said, came back to Georgia to find his home emptied out. 
</P>
<P>
	Browning said the pair maintained separate residences for six  
years before reconciling in late 1993 or early 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	The separation agreement called for Mrs. Gingrich to get $2,000  
a month for six months, control over money market and checking 
accounts and the couple's 1984 Ford Thunderbird. It made Gingrich 
responsible for the couple's bank loans and a Hecht's department 
store account. 
</P>
<P>
	The couple also divided the furniture in Washington residence  
and in their apartment in Jonesboro. 
</P>
<P>
	Gingrich, who now runs a political consulting firm, filed his  
request after his wife asked a judge to freeze the couple's assets 
until their divorce is final. Mrs. Gingrich claims her husband 
transferred ``substantial portions of certain valuable assets'' 
before filing for divorce. Gingrich has denied the allegation. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Gingrich, a county planner and business consultant from  
Ohio, referred all questions pertaining to the divorce to attorney 
John Mayoue. 
</P>
<P>
	Mayoue was out of the office Monday and could not be reached for  
comment.

<HEADLINE> Browns' Spielman May Retire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BEREA, Ohio (AP) -- When the Cleveland Browns signed him, Chris  
Spielman gave them his word. He promised if he couldn't play at an 
acceptable level, he would hand in his jersey and walk away from 
football without shedding a tear. 
</P>
<P>
	That day might have arrived prematurely for No. 54.  
</P>
<P>
	Spielman, the Browns' intense middle linebacker attempting a  
comeback from neck fusion surgery in 1997, could announce his 
retirement today after sustaining a second ``stinger'' in his 
surgically repaired neck following a violent hit in an exhibition 
game on Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
	The Browns scheduled a 2 p.m. news conference at their  
headquarters to discuss Spielman's status. 
</P>
<P>
	Spielman suffered temporary paralysis after being blindsided by  
Bears center Casey Wiegmann during the Browns' 35-24 win over 
Chicago. The 33-year-old Spielman was helped from the field after 
the collision and taken to the Cleveland Clinic for an MRI. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the second time during the preseason that Spielman has  
had to undergo tests following a ferocious hit. On the first day of 
training camp, he and fullback Tarek Saleh had a helmet-to-helmet 
collision that initially gave Spielman second thoughts about his 
comeback. 
</P>
<P>
	After the most recent hit, Spielman, an Ohio football icon, is  
again contemplating retirement. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's exploring all of his options,'' said Browns coach Chris  
Palmer, who spoke to Spielman twice on Sunday. ``He's trying to 
think things out. He's looking at things from different sides. He's 
going to look at everything and go from there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Palmer wouldn't go so far as to say if he recommended to  
Spielman that the 10-year veteran should retire. However, Palmer 
intimated all that may be left for Spielman to do was announce his 
career was over. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's some things that have to be ironed out, discussed,  
looked at,'' said Palmer, who was visibly shaken after Saturday's 
game. ``I think once that's all done, I think we'll be in pretty 
good shape.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After speaking with Spielman over the phone early Sunday morning  
from the hospital, Palmer said the two visited again at 8 a.m. in 
Palmer's office. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had a good conversation,'' Palmer said. ``It was very  
candid. It was a situation that he expressed some things to me, I 
expressed some things to him that will remain private. That's 
between the coach and the player. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wanted a clear mind in the morning to talk to him. I think  
he had a clear mind and came in and talked to me. The fact we 
talked man-to-man and eye-to-eye is real good.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Spielman was unavailable for comment on Sunday.  
</P>
<P>
	Defending a screen play in the first quarter against the Bears,  
Spielman shed and spun off one blocker, but as he turned and before 
he could get his feet planted, Wiegmann buried him. 
</P>
<P>
	Spielman stayed on the ground for several moments, and later  
told Cleveland offensive tackle Lomas Brown, who also played with 
him in Detroit, that he had been momentarily paralyzed. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's scary,'' Brown said. ``I don't want to tell him what to  
do, but I think he should have a long talk with his wife Stefanie 
and think about what he wants to do. Life is more important that 
football.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wiegmann offered Spielman some assistance after the play.  
</P>
<P>
	``I thought I hit him good, but I didn't think I did that,''  
Wiegmann said. ``He looked me right in the eye, and I was going to 
help him up but he said to me he didn't want to get up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Spielman had two vertebrae fused in his neck in 1997 while he  
was with the Buffalo Bills. He missed the final eight games that 
season, and was prepared to come back last year. 
</P>
<P>
	But he put his playing career on hold to care for his family  
after his wife underwent breast cancer surgery. Stefanie is now 
cancer-free. 
</P>
<P>
	The Plain Dealer reported today that Spielman's father, Sonny  
Spielman, said that if asked he would advise his son to retire as a 
player. He said Chris Spielman has a lot to consider, such as his 
wife's battle with cancer and the ability to help care for his 
children. 
</P>
<P>
	``If the cancer recurs, you don't want to have a mom battling  
cancer and a dad in a wheelchair,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Browns signed him to a three-year contract in February, and  
Spielman instantly became the expansion team's most popular player 
because of his Ohio roots as a high school star at Massillon and 
All-America at Ohio State. 
</P>
<P>
	Spielman has always played every down as if it was his last, and  
the toll of more than 20 years of punishment may have finally 
caught up to him. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's nobody playing this game that's 50 years old,'' Palmer  
said. ``You only have so many blocks, so many tackles in your body, 
and the guy upstairs says it's time to sit back and watch somebody 
else play. That happens sometimes when you're 18, sometimes when 
you're 22 or 35. But it happens.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If Spielman's career is over, the Browns are losing more than  
just an inside linebacker, Palmer said. Their losing a player with 
an unparalleled work ethic who leads by example. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's one of a kind,'' Palmer said. ``He's a guy that owes  
everything to football. He's a guy that respects the game, has a 
passion for the game. His family is in football, he probably grew 
up with a football on the kitchen table.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Taken in the second round of the 1988 draft by Detroit, Spielman  
spent his first eight seasons with the Lions before signing as a 
free agent with Buffalo in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	A four-time Pro Bowl selection, he's made 1,441 tackles with 10  
sacks and six interceptions in 10 seasons. He has started in all 
148 he has played.

<HEADLINE> Underwood a No-Show for Dolphins </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DAVIE, Fla. (AP) -- Enigmatic Dimitrius Underwood is becoming  
predictable. 
</P>
<P>
	The rookie defensive end failed to show Monday for his first  
practice with the Miami Dolphins, which didn't surprise his family 
and didn't seem to bother coach Jimmy Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
	Underwood, who left the Minnesota Vikings unannounced to focus  
on his faith, was claimed off waivers Aug. 16 by the Dolphins and 
agreed to report for practice Monday. But he failed to make his 
flight Sunday night from Michigan to Fort Lauderdale. 
</P>
<P>
	``He missed the plane,'' said his sister, Andrea. ``That's the  
norm. I've never known Dimitrius to catch the plane he's supposed 
to catch. I wouldn't get alarmed at that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Underwood caught a later flight, arrived Monday night and was  
expected for practice Tuesday. Johnson shrugged off the situation, 
despite renewed doubts about the rookie's commitment to a football 
career. 
</P>
<P>
	``You've got to understand our motive here,'' Johnson said.  
``Our whole thought process was to get an outstanding talent for 
the future. It would have been fine with me if he had reported next 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	``We feel he's going to want to play football eventually. We  
just didn't know when.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Underwood, 22, was taken by the Vikings with the 29th pick in  
the first round of the draft. He was released Aug. 11 by the 
Vikings after practicing just once, and this month he has changed 
his mind about whether to play football at least four times -- maybe 
five. 
</P>
<P>
	But Johnson said he's not bothered by Underwood's pattern of  
unreliability. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have a tendency to straighten out those patterns,'' Johnson  
said. ``If the pattern stays the same, obviously we'll have to 
address it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Underwood is already not the most popular player in the  
Dolphins' locker room. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hope the guy can get his act together,'' said veteran  
defensive end Trace Armstrong, sitting across from Underwood's 
vacant stall. ``He's like everybody else -- he's got to earn a spot 
on this team. He's not off to a good start.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Underwood's wavering between football and faith has attracted  
considerable national publicity. He made an appearance last week on 
Jim Rome's talk show on Fox Sports Net. 
</P>
<P>
	``I notice he did make the flight for the Jim Rome show,''  
Armstrong said. ``The thing that sticks in your throat is that if 
you bring a guy like that in, you're going to have to let somebody 
go. That can be tough to swallow, given the circumstances.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If Underwood joins the team, he'll bump another defensive  
lineman from the roster even though he's unlikely to play much this 
season. His conditioning is questionable because he sat out last 
season at Michigan State with a sprained ankle, and the Dolphins 
don't need to rush him into the lineup because of their depth in 
the front four.

<HEADLINE> Eleven People Treated for E. coli </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) -- A 2-year-old boy being treated for kidney  
failure was among 11 people sickened by E. coli bacteria after 
swimming in a lake in southwestern Washington, health officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Battle Ground Lake was closed Sunday as a precaution.  
</P>
<P>
	Jonah Runde, of Brush Prairie, Wash., became violently ill after  
swimming in the lake Aug. 15. He was listed in fair condition 
Sunday and was undergoing dialysis. 
</P>
<P>
	The boys' father, Neil Runde, said four members of his family  
became ill within days of swimming in the lake. Jonah experienced 
flu-like symptoms including bloody stool, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Janet Charles, a spokeswoman for the Southwest Washington Health  
District, said ``it was only in the last few days when we realized 
the Battle Ground Lake connection.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Health officials said they are not sure the lake north of  
Portland is the source of the E. coli, but it will remain closed 
for a week as a precaution. 
</P>
<P>
	E. coli bacteria can cause serious illness and sometimes death,  
particularly in children and the elderly. Symptoms include chills, 
fever, abdominal cramps and bloody diarrhea.

<HEADLINE> How JoePa Spent His Summer? </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Anybody who knows how Joe Paterno spent his summer should not  
have been surprised by Penn State beating Arizona 41-7. 
</P>
<P>
	Paterno is scary good at his job every weekend, but even better  
with extra time to prepare. Penn State is 19-9-1 in bowl games 
during his tenure, but that mark pales alongside the 28-5 record in 
openers the Nittany Lions carried into Saturday's matchup with the 
Wildcats. 
</P>
<P>
	Making matters worse for Arizona, Paterno was cooped up at home  
for long stretches this summer while his wife, Sue, recuperated 
from a broken hip. After watching Penn State alternate 
quarterbacks, run reverses and open up the offense in ways his 
detractors dared him to, it's obvious JoePa didn't spend his days 
padding back and forth to the refrigerator. 
</P>
<P>
	He was watching film, tearing through sketch pads and plotting  
what to do with last year's backup passer, junior Rashard Casey, 
whose athletic ability intrigued Paterno as much as his 
unpredictability scared him. And at age 73, this old dog proved 
capable of learning some new tricks. 
</P>
<P>
	Arizona took its No. 3 ranking to Happy Valley, Pa., expecting a  
great defense and found one -- ``We've volunteered for a dangerous 
mission,'' Wildcat coach Dick Tomey said coming in. ``Most of our 
guys have never been east of Denver.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So imagine Tomey's shock when No. 4 Penn State came out Saturday  
playing like one of those pass-happy Pac-10 teams he sees all the 
time on the other side of the Rockies. 
</P>
<P>
	Ohio State coach John Cooper doesn't have to imagine.  
</P>
<P>
	``Now I know how Dick Tomey felt yesterday,'' Cooper said after  
his ninth-ranked Buckeyes got beat 23-12 by 12th-ranked Miami. ``I 
feel the same way today.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The words ``gambling'' and ``college football'' should be used  
in the same sentence with the great caution, but they belong 
together anytime Top 25 teams agree to play each other before Labor 
Day. 
</P>
<P>
	Cooper, like Tomey, took a big risk, and both took a big fall.  
While Penn State climbed to No. 2 with the win, Arizona slid all 
the way to No. 15. Miami moved up to eighth, while Ohio State 
slipped to No. 12. 
</P>
<P>
	But both losing coaches should be praised more than punished in  
the long run. Paterno admitted he probably wouldn't have taken 
Arizona on in the opener if the game was scheduled for Tucson. And 
Hurricanes coach Butch Davis, in the midst of a rebuilding effort 
to put Miami back in the national championship mix, had precious 
little to lose. 
</P>
<P>
	What both losing coaches will count on now is the short memories  
of poll voters. Last season, Arizona lost a shootout to UCLA late 
in the Pac-10 race, and with it, a shot at the Rose Bowl. Ohio 
State lost to Michigan State the first weekend of November and 
didn't have enough time to recover. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you're going to lose, you better lose early,'' Cooper said.  
``Then you better win the rest of your games then hope that you get 
some help from some other teams.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Florida State coach Bobby Bowden, whose Seminoles were the No. 1  
preseason pick, got some help from other teams, but not the way he 
planned. His team was scheduled to open against Auburn. But after 
the school fired Bowden's son, Terry, as coach in midseason, Auburn 
paid $500,000 to buy out of a two-year, home-and-home deal with the 
Seminoles rather than face Bowden's wrath. 
</P>
<P>
	Louisiana Tech was a last-minute substitute, but for a while,  
the Bulldogs looked like anything but stand-ins. The score was tied 
at 7-7 late in the half, and it wasn't until Heisman Trophy 
candidate Peter Warrick took off on an electrifying stop-and-go 
20-yard touchdown that the Seminoles took control en route to a 
41-7 win. 
</P>
<P>
	All the maneuvering over the weekend left the two old guys,  
Bowden, 69, and Paterno, perched at the top of what is supposed to 
be a young man's game. Both are in their 33rd season of coaching, 
and while we're used to seeing the two close friends arm-wrestling 
each other for career achievement marks -- bowl victories, most wins 
by active Division I-A coaches -- this could be the year they do it 
face-to-face for a national championship. 
</P>
<P>
	Sure, it's early, but you underestimate the fire still burning  
in both men at your own risk. Last month, Penn State's 
All-Everything linebacker LaVar Arrington told Sports Illustrated 
that the magazine was right to rank his team No. 1. ``We're going 
to whip up on some people,'' Arrington said. 
</P>
<P>
	When those words got back to Paterno, he reminded Arrington that  
talking was easy. It's backing it up that's hard. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's never been part of a national championship team and he  
doesn't know how to get there,'' Paterno said. ``Maybe he needs 
some of the older people who have been there to show him the way.'' 
</P>

<HEADLINE> AT&AMP;T Cuts Long-Distance Rates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- AT&AMP;T Corp. is cutting prices for long-distance  
phone calls to 7 cents a minute and simplifying rates in response 
to a price war that is hurting the company's revenues. 
</P>
<P>
	The rate is still higher than offers introduced early this month  
from MCI WorldCom and Sprint. But AT&AMP;T hopes its easy-to-use plan 
will stem customer defections. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's amazing how complicated this industry can make saying,  
'Hello,''' AT&AMP;T chairman Mike Armstrong said in a teleconference 
call this morning. 
</P>
<P>
	The new AT&AMP;T rate announced today is good for calls made any  
time. Customers who want the rate also must pay the company a fee 
of $5.95 a month. AT&AMP;T had charged 15 cents a minute around the 
clock with no monthly fee or 10 cents a minute with a $4.95 fee. 
</P>
<P>
	In comparison, MCI offers weekend and weekday nighttime rates of  
5 cents a minute, but daytime fees go up to 25 cents a minute. Its 
monthly fee, though, is $1.95. 
</P>
<P>
	Sprint charges 5 cents per minute for nighttime calls for $5.95  
a month, with rates going up to 10 cents a minute for other calls. 
</P>
<P>
	The price wars are causing a larger-than-expected revenue  
erosion in AT&AMP;T's long-distance business. But AT&AMP;T said its 
financial results this year should nevertheless meet the 
expectations of Wall Street analysts due to surprising strong 
growth in its wireless and other promising businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	Overall, AT&AMP;T's revenue is expected to grow between 5 percent  
and 7 percent, with per-share profits between $2.13 and $2.20.

<HEADLINE> Co. Must Disclose Pension Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Employees considering retirement have the  
right to know that their company is seriously thinking of benefit 
changes that might affect their decision, a federal appeals court 
ruled. 
</P>
<P>
	In a pair of 2-1 rulings Monday, the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of  
Appeals said an employer's duty to keep employees informed of their 
retirement options includes not only answering questions truthfully 
but also disclosing information without being asked. 
</P>
<P>
	Other appellate courts have required employers to disclose, when  
asked, that they were ``seriously considering'' new retirement 
packages. Serious consideration has been defined to cover 
discussion by senior management with the authority to implement 
changes. 
</P>
<P>
	Monday's rulings reinstated suits by an Exxon employee and six  
Pacific Bell employees who said they would have delayed retirement 
if they'd been told the company was considering a sweetened 
retirement package. Their suits seek participation in the deals 
that were offered later. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal judges had dismissed both suits, saying the companies  
hadn't lied and had no duty to volunteer the information. 
</P>
<P>
	But the appeals court said a pension plan, which has the duty to  
protect its members' interests, must notify them of potential 
changes, rather than ``penalizing a person who fails to ask the 
right questions at the right time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That's an important step, because ``if you don't know what's  
going on, how do you know to ask a question?'' said Thomas 
Moukawsher, lawyer for the former Exxon employee. He said his 
client, who worked on an oil drilling rig off the Southern 
California coast, was ``completely reliant on the chain of 
communications that the company had.'' 
</P>
<P>
	James Severson, lawyer for Exxon Co. U.S.A., said the ruling  
would create ``fertile ground for lawyers and litigants'' and 
confusion for employers. 
</P>
<P>
	The Exxon employee, Ernest Bins, planned to retire Jan. 1, 1996  
and heard rumors the company was planning to add a cash payment to 
its normal pension. He delayed his retirement date for a month and 
questioned several supervisors through late December but was told 
they knew nothing. 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, Exxon U.S.A. had been studying the benefit increase as  
an incentive to early retirement for several months, the court 
said. The company president reviewed the proposal in mid-December, 
top executives of the parent Exxon Corp. reviewed and approved it 
in January, and it was formally announced less than two weeks after 
Bins retired. 
</P>
<P>
	The benefit would have been worth $35,000 or $40,000 to Bins,  
his lawyer said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pacific Bell suit was filed by six employees who took early  
retirement in June 1995 after being told by managers that the 
company was in bad shape, planned layoffs and did not intend to 
make a better offer. 
</P>
<P>
	The company actually had a healthy pension plan and was planning  
to offer an improved retirement plan to its union, the court said. 
The plan, adopted in August 1995, would have been worth between 
$27,000 and $99,000 to the six plaintiffs. 
</P>
<P>
	In reinstating both suits, the court said both employers had  
seriously considered the improvements before the employees retired, 
and should have disclosed them, with no guarantees. 
</P>
<P>
	The cases are Bins vs. Exxon, 98-55662, and Wayne vs. Pacific  
Bell, 97-56456.

<HEADLINE> Trial May Solve Mysterious Deaths </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PERU, Ind. (AP) -- Prospective jurors were questioned today as  
the trial of a former nurse accused of killing seven hospital 
patients finally got under way. 
</P>
<P>
	Orville Lynn Majors Jr. arrived this morning at the Miami County  
Courthouse to face the people who will decide his guilt or 
innocence. Prosecutors allege Majors, 37, gave lethal injections to 
dozens of patients at Vermillion County Hospital five years ago, 
but they charged him with just seven murders. 
</P>
<P>
	In an unusual move to circumvent the effects of pretrial  
publicity, the trial was moved from Vermillion County to nearby 
Clay County, and the jurors were being selected in Miami County, 
more than 100 miles to the northeast. Jurors will be bused each 
week to Clay County, returning to their homes in and around Peru 
for the weekends. 
</P>
<P>
	The first batch of six men and six women, from a pool of 100  
whittled down from hundreds who filled out a questionnaire, were 
questioned this morning. They all said they felt they could serve 
in a trial that could last three months. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to take a lot of time and cost a lot of money for  
me, but if that's what it takes it doesn't really concern me,'' 
said a man identified only as Juror No. 44. 
</P>
<P>
	After both sides questioned a dozen prospects this morning, two  
men and one woman were tentatively chosen. 
</P>
<P>
	By Friday, if the selection proceeds goes as planned, the judge  
and attorneys will have settled on 12 jurors, six alternate jurors 
and four extra jurors who can hear the trial. Special Judge Ernest 
Yelton wants to start the trial Sept. 7. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors suspect Majors in dozens of patients' deaths, but  
they whittled the charges to seven cases they believe exhibit the 
strongest evidence that Majors gave his patients unauthorized and 
lethal injections. 
</P>
<P>
	In Vermillion County Hospital's four-bed intensive care unit,  
120 people died in 1994. But in each of the previous four years, no 
more than 31 ICU patients died. A consultant who studied patient 
charts and nurses' time cards found patients were 43 times more 
likely to die when Majors was on duty. 
</P>
<P>
	Yelton barred prosecutors from using such data at trial, saying  
the state should stick to specific evidence of the seven murders. 
Prosecutors said the state can prove its case without the 
statistical studies. 
</P>
<P>
	In court documents, some relatives say they saw Majors give  
their loved ones shots before they died. Police say vials 
containing traces of the potassium chloride or epinephrine and 
syringes were found at Majors' home and in his van. 
</P>
<P>
	Majors says he's innocent of all charges. Defense lawyer I.  
Marshall Pinkus says jurors won't find it unusual that nurses give 
patients shots or that sick, elderly patients die in intensive care 
units. Some patients and co-workers at the hospital considered 
Majors a hardworking and sympathetic nurse, Pinkus said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hinting at what is a largely circumstantial case, a deputy  
prosecutor, Nina Alexander, asked several potential jurors today 
whether they needed direct evidence before they could convict 
someone of murder. 
</P>
<P>
	``What if you got up in the morning and there was 2 feet of snow  
on the ground, what would you conclude?'' Alexander asked. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously, it snowed,'' replied Juror No. 543.  
</P>
<P>
	``Did you see it snow?'' Alexander asked. When the juror said,  
``No,'' the prosecutor smiled and replied, ``That's what 
circumstantial evidence is.''

<HEADLINE> Venezuelan Oil Chief Resigns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) -- The head of Venezuela's huge state oil  
monopoly resigned Monday, apparently because of conflicts among the 
company's top management over production policies. 
</P>
<P>
	Roberto Mandini announced his resignation as president of  
Petroleos de Venezuela, known by its Spanish acronym PdVSA, in a 
video that was shown to the company's employees, spokesman 
Alejandro Almaral told Dow Jones Newswires. 
</P>
<P>
	No replacement was immediately named, though a likely candidate  
was the company's vice president, Hector Ciavaldini. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts said Mandini resigned because of policy differences  
with other executives at PdVSA, one of the world's largest oil 
companies. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the previous administration, PdVSA embarked on an  
ambitious expansion plan, securing market share by making price 
subordinate to supply. But the Chavez administration has sharply 
curtailed that plan as part of Venezuela's policy of reducing 
output to raise prices. 
</P>
<P>
	Mandini probably couldn't live with PdVSA's change of policy,  
said Alan Viergutz, a Caracas based oil analyst. ``The ministry has 
reduced PdVSA's long term investment plan and is complying with the 
oil cuts. Both factors weren't necessarily favorable to PdVSA,'' 
Viergutz said. 
</P>
<P>
	Alberto Quiros, a former president of Shell de Venezuela, said  
Mandini's resignation probably has more to do with an internal war 
with Ciavaldini, who reportedly has a closer relationship with 
Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez. 
</P>
<P>
	``They both seem to represent different policies within PdVSA,''  
Quiros said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ciavaldini stands for subordination by PdVSA to the state while  
Mandini wants to keep PdVSA open to the international market and 
preserve its independence, Quiros said. 
</P>
<P>
	Venezuela competes with Saudi Arabia and Mexico as the No. 1  
foreign oil supplier to the United States.

<HEADLINE> Fires Char 200,000 Acres Out West </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Wind-driven wildfires burned untamed Monday in six Western  
states, crackling across more than 100,000 acres of timber, dry 
brush and cactus, destroying homes and forcing thousands of 
residents to flee. 
</P>
<P>
	Eighteen fires burned in Idaho, Montana, Nevada, Utah,  
Washington and California, where homes were among 30 structures 
incinerated by a wildfire in Apple Valley some 80 miles northeast 
of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	It wasn't known how many homes were destroyed, U.S. Forest  
Service spokeswoman Karen McKinley said. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 400 residents left homes Sunday afternoon as 30 mph  
winds pushed flames through 17,000 acres of brush and spiny Joshua 
Trees. Five people were arrested for allegedly looting abandoned 
homes, sheriff's spokeswoman Jennie Risley said. 
</P>
<P>
	John Sullivan left the Apple Valley High School evacuation  
center early Monday expecting to find his home in rubble. It was 
still standing. 
</P>
<P>
	Grinning during a cellular telephone call to his wife, he said,  
``Good news. The house is standing. Nothing got burned.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fifty miles to the west, more than 1,200 acres was burning in a  
rugged, brushy area of the Angeles National Forest. More than 4,000 
people, most of them campers, were forced out of San Gabriel 
Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
	About 300 firefighters battled the blaze with the help of two  
water-dropping helicopters. Desperately needed air tankers were 
unavailable. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're very seriously hurting with a lack of resources,'' U.S.  
Forest Service spokeswoman Linda Steinberg said. ``We're really 
struggling with it. The San Bernardino fire is taking about 
everything. They take precedence over us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The National Interagency Fire Center in Boise, Idaho, said  
100,000 acres were burning in six states on Monday and 10,000 
firefighters were fighting flames. More than 100 aircraft were 
assigned to the fires. 
</P>
<P>
	Firefighting ranks were thinning, but James Stone at the Boise  
center said, ``We haven't run out yet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The West's largest blaze, a 45,000-acre fire north of Reno, was  
surrounded late Sunday and firefighters were dousing hot spots on 
Monday.

<HEADLINE> Palestinians Describe 'Crisis' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JERUSALEM (AP) -- Palestinians described a ``crisis'' atmosphere  
in negotiations with Israel today, just days before Secretary of 
State Madeleine Albright's arrival in the region. 
</P>
<P>
	Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak was threatening to implement  
the U.S.-brokered Wye agreement according to his interpretation if 
the Palestinians do not back down on two key issues by Thursday: a 
timetable for a West Bank withdrawal and the release of 
Palestinians jailed for anti-Israel activity. Barak had originally 
set a deadline for this evening, but later said he was willing to 
wait a little longer. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is a crisis in the negotiations, and the first reason is  
that of political prisoners,'' Nabil Amr, an aide to Palestinian 
leader Yasser Arafat, told The Associated Press. ``The way Israel 
is dealing with this issue is causing us great worry.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A senior adviser to Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, Osama  
el-Baz, was unable to mediate a breakthrough in separate talks 
Sunday and early today with Arafat and Barak. 
</P>
<P>
	The Egyptians are hoping to oversee a signing ceremony on a  
possible agreement during Albright's visit to the region. 
</P>
<P>
	A Palestinian negotiator, asking not to be identified, said the  
Israelis had made some concessions on prisoners today, but there 
were still gaps. Barak's office indicated Sunday that Israel might 
release Palestinians who had been involved in anti-Israel attacks 
but were members of groups supporting the peace process. 
</P>
<P>
	Relatives of the prisoners, who enjoy huge support among  
Palestinians, demonstrated in the West Bank town of Nablus to 
pressure the negotiators not to cave in to Israel. 
</P>
<P>
	``No peace and no safety without the release of prisoners,'' one  
woman chanted into a megaphone. 
</P>
<P>
	If Islamic militants held by the Palestinian Authority are  
mistreated, their colleagues will carry out attacks in Israel, said 
a fax signed by the Islamic Jihad and sent today to news agencies. 
</P>
<P>
	It was impossible to immediately confirm the authenticity of the  
fax. 
</P>
<P>
	Top Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat and his Israeli  
counterpart, Gilead Sher, were due to resume talks this evening. 
</P>
<P>
	Barak said Israel was still awaiting ``satisfactory answers''  
from the Palestinians regarding an Israeli plan to time the final 
Wye-mandated withdrawal for February 2000, to coincide with 
achieving a framework for the final phase of the peace talks. 
</P>
<P>
	The Palestinians want Wye completed before the year is out, and  
would prefer further West Bank concessions -- Wye will leave them 
with under half of the disputed territory -- before proceeding to 
final status talks. 
</P>
<P>
	After briefing parliament's Defense and Foreign Affairs  
Committee on the talks, Barak said the Palestinians had ``two or 
three'' days to come up with ``satisfactory answers'' to Israeli 
proposals. 
</P>
<P>
	``If the Palestinians do not choose this, we will implement the  
Wye accords as they were signed, as they were written,'' Barak 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	That would mean an open-ended pullout from the West Bank and  
Israel releasing prisoners solely according to its criteria -- 
prospects likely to infuriate the Palestinians. 
</P>
<P>
	Erekat said that such ultimatums were counterproductive. He  
rejected Israeli claims that Palestinians were resisting signing 
because they wanted to prompt deeper American involvement in the 
process. 
</P>

	If there is no agreement by the time Albright arrives, ``we're  
the vulnerable side, the pressure will be put on us,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite talks of crisis and ultimatums, each side maintained a  
friendly, optimistic tone: Erekat complimented his Israeli partners 
as ``the toughest negotiators I have seen in the last three 
years.'' Barak said the process was one of ``renewing confidence'' 
after the rancor of the Netanyahu years, and that he still expected 
an agreement by the end of the week. 
</P>
<P>
	Wye provides for an Israeli withdrawal from at least 11 percent  
of the West Bank. The sides have reached an agreement on opening 
``safe passages'' for Palestinian travel between the Gaza Strip and 
West Bank and the opening of a Palestinian port.

<HEADLINE> Gunman Kills 2 at Calif. Store </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GARDEN GROVE, Calif. (AP) -- A gunman sprayed an auto parts store  
with bullets Monday, killing two people and wounding four others. 
</P>
<P>
	It was unclear whether the victims were employees, customers or  
bystanders, Sgt. Todd Elgin said. Police said the motive was not 
known. 
</P>
<P>
	The gunman opened fire about 1 p.m. outside Robotek, which sells  
performance car accessories, then burst inside and resumed the 
attack. Witnesses said the young man fled from the store in a gray 
minivan and another man may have fled with him. 
</P>
<P>
	Three people were in critical condition and undergoing surgery.  
</P>
<P>
	An 18-year-old man was shot in the back, a 17-year-old person  
was hit in the neck and grazed in the left hand, and a 48-year-old 
person had several gunshots wounds to the neck, cheek, arm, thigh 
and buttocks, said a hospital spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
	A 15-year-old boy was shot in the ankle and was in good  
condition.

<HEADLINE> Hotmail Temporarily Shut Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	REDMOND, Wash. (AP) -- Microsoft temporarily shut down its free  
Hotmail e-mail system Monday after the discovery of a security flaw 
that left millions of e-mail accounts vulnerable to unauthorized 
access. 
</P>
<P>
	The Redmond-based software firm took roughly two hours to fix  
the problem, which was first reported by the Swedish newspaper 
Expressen. The company said the trouble was fixed by 10 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
	``As soon as we were notified, we got our developers and testers  
on it, and we were able to determine a fix,'' said Deanna Sanford, 
lead product manager for MSN marketing, Microsoft's Internet 
division. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the newspaper, several hackers around the world had  
set up Web sites offering unauthorized access to Hotmail's 40 
million accounts simply by typing in a user name. 
</P>
<P>
	Unauthorized users were able to read and send mail from any  
account without knowing the user's secret password. 
</P>
<P>
	Sanford said she does not know how long the Web sites were  
accessible, but the company was not alerted to the problem until 
early Monday morning. 
</P>
<P>
	``We haven't heard any reports, any customers calling to say  
they were affected by this directly,'' she added. 
</P>
<P>
	Hotmail users don't need to worry about downloading a fix, said  
Sanford, adding that the security flaw in the company's servers had 
been plugged. 
</P>
<P>
	``The good news is the Hotmail servers are back up and running  
now and the issue has been resolved,'' Sanford said.

<HEADLINE> Grass at Giants Stadium Debated </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) -- The decision on whether to install  
a permanent grass field at Giants Stadium probably will be made 
soon, and it seems the choice will rest with the New York Jets. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials for the New York Giants of the NFL and the New  
York-New Jersey MetroStars of the MLS said Monday they were 
impressed with the grass field experiments the past two summers and 
that they were leaning toward playing on the surface full time. 
</P>
<P>
	Jets coach Bill Parcells was not available for comment on the  
issue on Monday, but he seemed to have some doubts last week about 
whether a grass field would hold with two NFL teams playing on it 
for an entire season. 
</P>
<P>
	The three teams will meet with officials from the New Jersey  
Sports and Exposition Authority, which operates the stadium, to 
discuss the field within a couple of weeks, said Bob Castronovo, 
the authority's executive vice president. 
</P>
<P>
	The grass field, which consists of 6,000 trays of grass put over  
the existing artificial field, was put to its biggest test over the 
past 10 days when four football games were played along with a 
MetroStars' game. 
</P>
<P>
	The grass in the middle of the field had turned brown and the  
team logos painted in the end zones were a little worn toward the 
end of the last weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	``It seemed to be in good shape,'' Parcells said after the Jets  
beat the Giants 16-10 on Saturday. ``It was a little worn in the 
middle but that's the great thing about it. They can put grass in 
whenever they want it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	John Mara, the Giants executive vice president and general  
counsel, said the groundskeepers were told not to touch up the 
field the last 10 days just so everyone could see how the field 
held up and where the wear patterns would be. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody knows grass is better,'' Mara said. ``The question  
is will it work here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mara felt the decision to switch to a permanent grass field  
would have to be unanimous for it to happen. 
</P>
<P>
	The cost of installing the grass field the past two seasons has  
been well over $1 million and has been paid for mostly by the 
MetroStars, said Charlie Stillitano, general manager of the soccer 
team. 
</P>
<P>
	If the teams decide to install a grass field permanently, it  
would cost the Jets, the Giants and the sports authority about $1 
million each for the initial installment, said Tim Hassett, a vice 
president with the sports authority. The yearly maintenance would 
be about $400,000, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The MetroStars would share in the maintenance cost but they  
would not be asked to pay for the initial installment since they 
put up the money for the experiment, Hassett said. 
</P>
<P>
	Clark Companies, of Delhi, N.Y., whose tray system is being  
used, would replace the trays in the center of the field -- the most 
used portion of the field -- three times during the season. 
</P>
<P>
	Castronovo said the current artificial surface would be kept,  
just in case something goes wrong.

<HEADLINE> Canandaigua Brands Founder Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CANANDAIGUA, N.Y. (AP) -- Marvin Sands, who developed a bulk wine  
company into the nation's second-largest supplier of wine, died of 
cancer at his home Saturday. He was 75. 
</P>
<P>
	Canandaigua Brands Inc., based in the Rochester suburb of  
Fairport, makes and distributes more than 150 brands of wine, beer 
and spirits. It is second in size only to E&AMP;J Gallo. 
</P>
<P>
	Sands, the son of a wine bottler, graduated from the University  
of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. He served as an ensign in the 
U.S. Navy during World War II. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1945, Sands took over the operation of a bulk wine supplier  
in Canandaigua that had been purchased by his father. That business 
took off in 1954 when he introduced a successful sweet wine called 
Richard's Wild Irish Rose. 
</P>
<P>
	``That was the beginning of today's Canandaigua Brands,'' said  
his son, Richard Sands, after whom the wine was named. ``He 
realized how difficult it is to sell bulk wine. If you charge a 
penny more than the competition, no one wanted to buy. He felt he 
had no ownership. The way to accomplish that was to have a special 
blend and a proprietary name.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although Wild Irish Rose is only a small part of Canandaigua  
Brands today, it is the best-selling dessert wine in the country, 
Richard Sands said. 
</P>
<P>
	In the 1960s, Canandaigua bought Tenner Bros. Winery in South  
Carolina and the Hammondsport Wine Co., gaining entry into the 
sparkling wine market. 
</P>
<P>
	His acquisitions included Bisceglia Brothers in California,  
Manischewitz Kosher Wines and Widmer Wines. 
</P>
<P>
	Richard Sands took over as president of Canandaigua in 1993 and  
became chief executive officer in 1996. Another son, Robert Sands, 
is chief executive officer of international operations, vice 
president and general counsel of Canandaigua Brands and chief 
executive officer of Canandaigua Wine Co. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to his sons, Sands is survived by his wife of 52  
years, Mickey Sands, of Canandaigua; a son-in-law, Dr. Andrew 
Stern, of Pittsford; and several grandchildren. His daughter, Dr. 
Laurie Sands, died of cancer in 1995.

<HEADLINE> 'Mr. Irrelevant' Among Bears Cuts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAKE FOREST, Ill. (AP) -- Jim Finn, ``Mr. Irrelevant'' in this  
year's draft, was among 15 players released Monday by the Chicago 
Bears. 
</P>
<P>
	Finn, a fullback from Pennsylvania, was the last player chosen  
in the draft. That player is honored every June at ``Irrelevant 
Week'' in Newport Beach, Calif. Finn still could end up on the 
five-player practice squad, which will be set Sept. 6. 
</P>
<P>
	Moses Moreno, who started one game for the Chicago Bears as a  
rookie last season, was also cut. While the other moves were made 
in the morning, Moreno's release wasn't announced until later that 
evening. 
</P>
<P>
	Moreno, picked in the seventh round out of Colorado State last  
year, was the No. 3 quarterback for most of the season. But with 
Erik Kramer hurt, Steve Stenstrom ineffective and the Bears' 
offense uninspired, Moreno got his first start against Tampa Bay. 
</P>
<P>
	He completed 18-of-41 attempts for 153 yards and one touchdown  
in the 31-17 loss. But he sprained his right ankle on the last 
offensive play of the game and was placed on injured reserve 2 1/2 
weeks later. 
</P>
<P>
	He was a victim of numbers this year. With rookie Cade McNown  
and veterans Shane Matthews and Jim Miller, Moreno didn't get much 
playing time. He was 11-of-18 for 108 yards with one interception 
in the preseason.

<TEXT>
<P>
	EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) -- Center Brian Williams, attempting a  
comeback after missing two seasons with an eye injury, only bruised 
his left knee in the New York Giants' preseason game with the New 
York Jets on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams' did not practice on Monday, and his status for the  
Giants preseason finale at Baltimore is uncertain. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the worst-case scenario is he misses this game,''  
Giants coach Jim Fassel said. ``That's great.'' 
</P>
<P>
	An 11-year veteran, Williams was injured in the second quarter  
in a knee-to-knee collision with one of the Jets' defensive linemen 
on a running play. He stayed in one more play, but then walked off 
the field. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was able to ride the (stationary) bike, but it's just hard  
to straighten out and I don't have a lot of flexibility,'' Williams 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Giants waived punter Brion Hurley, quarterback Steve Buck,  
receiver Anthony Tucker and running back Reynard Rutherford on 
Monday. Defensive end C.W. Estes, the former Army player who was 
sidelined the last two weeks with a foot injury, was cut after 
reaching an injury settlement. 
</P>
<P>
	Fullback Raymond Prister (foot) and cornerback Kelvin Suggs  
(knee) were placed on injured reserve. 
</P>
<P>
	The Giants have 72 players on the roster, but they won't have to  
make any more cuts until next week because they have seven NFL 
Europe roster exemptions.

<HEADLINE> American, Pilots Negotiate Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FORT WORTH, Texas (AP) -- American Airlines and its pilots were  
making a last ditch effort Monday to reach an agreement over the 
airline's plans to integrate Reno Air Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	Since American's parent company, AMR Corp., announced the Reno  
purchase last December, the two sides have disagreed over how the 
pilots will be merged into the company. The dispute evolved into a 
pilot sickout in February that stranded hundreds of thousands of 
passengers all over the world and cost the company $225 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The Allied Pilots Association and the Fort Worth, Texas-based  
company have continued to negotiate since the illegal job action, 
though have been able to reach a solution. The integration of the 
Reno pilots is scheduled to take place Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the sticking points in this deal has been the protocol  
for any future acquisitions. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were able to conclude deals with two other unions  
relatively quickly, but after more than nine months of negotiation 
and mediation we are still without an agreement with APA,'' Robert 
Baker, executive vice president of operations, wrote to the 
company's 9,500 pilots. 
</P>
<P>
	The two sides agreed to give merger discussions a final attempt  
before American moves ahead with bringing Reno into its system, 
company officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	American's plan will bring former Reno pilots into the company  
at the bottom of the seniority list. That means lower-paid Reno 
pilots will get a boost in their salaries, but they will have less 
say in their flying schedules. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, a dozen American pilots who underwent training in July  
will move into captain jobs formerly held by their Reno 
counterparts. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the union has been reminding the pilots that they  
must not repeat the February sickout. That illegal job action 
resulted in a federal judge holding the union in contempt when his 
order to return to work was ignored. 
</P>
<P>
	During talks with the judge, the APA agreed to a permanent  
injunction barring the union and its members from any future 
actions -- strike, sickout or slowdown. That decision leaves the 
union with no recourse but to ultimately accept American's decision 
to go forward with integration, according to observers. 
</P>
<P>
	The union has e-mailed its members that U.S. District Judge Joe  
Kendall's order remains in effect and that the APA must comply. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge also ordered the pilots' union to pay a $45 million  
judgment as punishment for the sickout. The union has promised an 
appeal of the massive award, which is larger than the union's net 
worth.

<HEADLINE> Teachers' Union Rejects Extra Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- The Detroit teachers' union today rejected an  
extension of talks proposed by its own negotiators and said 
teachers would not work without a new contract. Classes had been 
scheduled to begin Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The word ``strike'' wasn't used. But when asked if that meant  
the teachers were going on strike, union vice president John Butler 
replied, ``That's another word for it.'' 
</P>

disappointed by the vote. He said the 172,000-student district 
would wait until it sees how many teachers report Tuesday before 
deciding whether to hold classes.

	``We're hoping teachers will come back to school. But we are not  
at this time encouraging students to come to school until we know 
there are teachers there to teach them,'' Adamany said. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this morning, Detroit Public Schools officials and union  
negotiators had agreed to extend their current contract by 10 days 
while they continue to negotiate a new deal. 
</P>
<P>
	But in a vote later this morning, the Detroit Federation of  
Teachers rejected the extension proposal. After the vote, which was 
held at Cobo Center, teachers headed to the Schools' Center 
Building to picket. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would have liked for them to follow my recommendations to go  
back to work for 10 days while I negotiate. That was my 
recommendation,'' union president John Elliot said. 
</P>
<P>
	The union, unhappy with contract negotiations for the past  
month, had threatened a possible strike before the scheduled start 
of classes. 
</P>
<P>
	The union has not walked out since 1992. A state law passed in  
1994 restricts strikes by public school workers and provides for 
fines equal to a day's pay for each day of the strike. 
</P>
<P>
	Anita Griggs, 40, who has been an elementary school teacher for  
15 years, said she wasn't in favor of the contract extension. 
</P>
<P>
	``Once they get us in the classrooms, there's no reason to  
bargain in good faith. They've got the labor,'' Ms. Griggs said on 
her way to the union meeting to discuss the negotiations this 
morning. 
</P>
<P>
	In a statement before the vote, Adamany said a tentative  
agreement on a broad array of issues had been reached, though a few 
issues remained on the table.

<HEADLINE> Maps of Places That Don't Exist </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Anyone who wants to pinpoint where James Bond  
met that blonde with the bottle of champagne on her curvy hip need 
only consult ``Language of the Land,'' an unusual book published by 
the Library of Congress offering maps of imaginary places. 
</P>
<P>
	Another map shows just where Tom Sawyer whitewashed his famous  
fence. Still another points out the spot at which Paul Bunyan's ox 
Babe, trying to catch a field mouse, dug the Mammoth Cave. 
</P>
<P>
	L. Frank Baum's ``Wonderful World of Oz'' is charted.  
Illustrator Dick Martin located the Shifting Sands and Deadly 
Desert, with Emerald City and Glinda's Palace smack in the middle. 
</P>
<P>
	A Yellow Brick Road is there too, though it's not clearly  
labeled. 
</P>
<P>
	``Literary maps depict ideas as much as places,'' wrote  
co-author Martha Hopkins in the book's introduction. 
</P>
<P>
	Most literary maps, Hopkins notes, are not drawn to scale and  
contain little detailed information on topography, geology, towns, 
rivers or roads. They ``present a world in which authors and books 
are the dominant features,'' she explains. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, some of the places are real enough. Author Ian Fleming  
made his James Bond stories credible by searching out authentic 
settings for what the library calls his ``assignments and 
assignations.'' Only ``Agent 007'' himself and his exploits sprang 
from Fleming's imagination. 
</P>
<P>
	J.R.R. Tolkien's completely imaginary ``Middle Earth'' rates  
three highly detailed maps. 
</P>
<P>
	Somewhere between reality and imagination lies Mark Twain's St.  
Petersburg, the home of Tom Sawyer, modeled on Hannibal, Mo. That's 
where the young Samuel Clemens lived before he went piloting on the 
Mississippi, where he got his pen-name. 
</P>
<P>
	The half-whitewashed fence is on St. Petersburg's Hill Street,  
just across from Becky Thatcher's house. 
</P>
<P>
	``There ain't anything that is so interesting to look at as a  
place that a book has talked about,'' Twain quotes Tom as saying in 
later life. 
</P>
<P>
	``Language of the Land'' describes and reproduces the fantastic  
maps, along with many others covering the literary landscape. It 
was compiled by Hopkins of the library's Interpretive Programs 
Office and Michael Buscher of the Geography and Map Division. 
</P>
<P>
	The maps mostly cover English-speaking countries -- Canada and  
Australia have maps that illustrate their best-known books. Even 
one for Paris gives a large space to Oscar Wilde and American 
writer Gertrude Stein, whom the French do not see as important to 
their literature. There's also a bright map, shaped and colored 
like a parrot -- written in English -- devoted to Latin American 
writers. 
</P>
<P>
	Maps from days when Latin and Greek got more intensive study  
show the voyages of Odysseus and Aeneas. Even troubled Balkan 
politics gets touched on -- unintentionally. A map on places in 
Hungarian literature includes portions of Romania which once 
belonged to Hungary, and which many Hungarians would dearly like to 
get back. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``Language of the Land: The Library of Congress Book of Literary  
Maps'' is available for $50 by mail from the Superintendent of 
Documents, P.O. Box 371954, Pittsburgh, Pa. 15250-7954. The stock

<HEADLINE> Journalists' Privilege Restored </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A long-standing privilege protecting journalists  
from divulging unused material from nonconfidential sources except 
in special instances has been restored by a federal appeals court. 
</P>
<P>
	The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals decided Friday that  
journalists can block disclosure of nonconfidential materials, 
unless it can be proven they are not reasonably obtainable from 
other sources. 
</P>
<P>
	The appeals court wrote that it now agrees there has been a  
qualified privilege in the past for journalists, but said the 
privilege ``is less demanding than for material acquired in 
confidence.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 2nd Circuit noted that judges in its region for nearly 20  
years have consistently assumed that a journalists' privilege for 
nonconfidential materials exists. 
</P>
<P>
	It said the ``resulting wholesale exposure of press files to  
litigant scrutiny would burden the press with heavy costs,'' damage 
its ability to do its job, encourage journalists to clean out files 
frequently and scare sources away or cause them to insist upon 
anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	The ruling came in a case in which litigants subpoenaed  
unbroadcast videotape from a ``Dateline'' segment aired on NBC. 
</P>
<P>
	The appeals court, while restoring the privilege for journalists  
it had taken away last September, said NBC must turn over the 
videotape because the material could not be obtained from other 
sources. 
</P>
<P>
	Susan Weiner, a lawyer for NBC, said it was unusual for the  
appeals court to reverse its position. 
</P>
<P>
	``Because this decision restores the privilege, it will be more  
difficult to get news materials except in cases where litigants can 
satisfy the standards set by the court,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	The network had refused to turn over unbroadcast videotape from  
a ``Dateline'' segment that was subpoenaed in a federal civil 
rights lawsuit a Hispanic couple filed against a Louisiana deputy 
sheriff. 
</P>
<P>
	A producer from the program videotaped the officer pulling over  
a rental car with out-of-state plates to test a theory that law 
enforcement officers in Louisiana were pulling over drivers because 
of race, nationality or out-of-state license plates. 
</P>
<P>
	NBC refused to release the complete tape to either party in the  
lawsuit, saying the First Amendment provided qualified privilege on 
material reporters get from nonconfidential sources.

<HEADLINE> New Test Flags Early HIV Infections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Health officials have a new tool to track the  
spread of AIDS: A blood test that can tell when infections are less 
than six months old. 
</P>
<P>
	Research presented Monday at the first national conference on  
AIDS prevention used the blood tests to show that new infections 
are continuing at a steady rate, as researchers previously 
estimated. 
</P>
<P>
	Though standard blood tests show whether a person is infected  
with HIV, the virus that causes AIDS, they do not tell if infection 
occurred recently or a long time ago. That has made it hard for 
scientists to say with certainty from year-to-year whether new 
infections are increasing, declining or staying the same. 
</P>
<P>
	The new test, developed by the Centers for Disease Control and  
Prevention along with other organizations, can identify infections 
as four-to-six months old using the same blood samples as the 
standard tests. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's the first time we have had timely HIV incidence data on a  
broad scale,'' said Dr. Robert Janssen, one of the CDC AIDS 
researchers who helped develop the test. 
</P>
<P>
	It's still too early to tell if the test will have significant  
medical impacts by catching early infections, Janssen said. But he 
said it should help newly infected patients identify sexual 
partners who either may have infected them or contracted the virus 
from the patient after he was infected. 
</P>
<P>
	The CDC has been using the new blood test for only about the  
last two months, Janssen said. 
</P>
<P>
	Using the new blood test to study 96,000 people visiting STD  
clinics in six cities between 1991 and 1997, the CDC found ``no 
apparent increases or decreases in the rate of new infections'' in 
either homosexuals or heterosexuals, said Dr. Hillard Weinstock, a 
CDC researcher.

	Dennis Veers Away From N.C.  
</P>
<P>
	NAGS HEAD, N.C. (AP) -- After sideswiping the North Carolina  
coast with 112 mph gusts, Hurricane Dennis today turned back out to 
sea. The storm's center got no closer than 60 miles from the shore. 
Even so, up to 8 inches of rain flooded streets and left 50,000 
without power. The storm was blamed for two early morning traffic 
deaths. By early evening, Dennis was 85 miles southeast of Cape 
Hatteras. A hurricane warning remained in effect for most of the 
North Carolina coast to the Virginia state line. Beaches as far 
north as New York's Long Island were closed to swimmers.

<P>
	JERUSALEM (AP) -- With pressure mounting for a peace deal before  
this week's arrival of U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, 
Israeli and Palestinian negotiators said they were on the verge of 
agreement. For the first time in months, the two sides spoke 
optimistically of carrying out the long-delayed Wye River peace 
accord. Meanwhile, the bodies of an Israeli couple were found in a 
forest on the border with the West Bank. Police suspected they were 
killed by Palestinians, raising worries of a resurgence of 
violence.

	East Timor Votes on Independence  
</P>
<P>
	DILI, Indonesia (AP) -- Independence activists claimed victory  
Monday in a referendum on East Timor's future, buoyed by long lines 
of voters who defied the threat of violence against the 
U.N.-sponsored balloting. Official results will not be known for 
days. Monday's ballot offered the remote, mostly Roman Catholic 
territory north of Australia a choice between seceding or becoming 
an autonomous region within Indonesia, the world's largest Muslim 
nation. U.N. officials estimated that more than 90 percent of 
451,000 voters cast ballots.

	Cigarette Prices Rise Again  
</P>
<P>
	RICHMOND, Va. (AP) -- The country's leading cigarette  
manufacturers have raised wholesale prices 18 cents a pack, 
anticipating an upcoming excise tax increase and higher costs 
stemming from their $206 billion settlement with the states over 
health care costs. After markups, the move is likely to increase 
retail prices by about 22 cents per pack, analysts said. Philip 
Morris USA, the world's biggest tobacco maker, initiated the 
increase Friday, which was matched by competitors.

	SYRACUSE, N.Y. (AP) -- President Clinton and first lady Hillary

	Teen Substance Abuse Surveyed  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Most teen-agers find it easier to talk about  
drugs with their mothers than with their fathers, and those who 
don't get along with their fathers are at far greater risk of 
smoking, drinking and using drugs, a survey found. It was issued by 
the private National Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse at 
Columbia University. Teens in two-parent families who have fair or 
poor relationships with their fathers are 68 percent more likely to 
use drugs than those in the average two-parent household.

	NEW YORK (AP) -- AT&AMP;T Corp. battled back against phone rivals on  
today by slashing long-distance rates to just 7 cents a minute for 
calls made any time. But the average residential customer makes 
only about 80 minutes of calls a month, according to the Federal 
Trade Commission, too little to compensate for AT&AMP;T's monthly fees.

<TEXT>
<P>
	WOLFSBURG, Germany (AP) -- Volkswagen and its Audi subsidiary are  
recalling about 428,000 cars worldwide, all produced in the first 
half of 1998, due to a potential problem with the vehicles' 
steering mechanism, VW said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The recall includes 270,000 VW Passats and 158,000 Audi A4, A6  
and A8 cars, said VW spokesman Jens Bobsien. 
</P>
<P>
	VW is sending letters to car owners instructing them to go to  
their dealer or mechanic to get the problem fixed at no charge as a 
precautionary measure. 
</P>
<P>
	There have been no known accidents as a result of the problem,  
Bobsien said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bobsien said the ``incomplete seal'' problem on the steering  
mechanism of the cars was discovered when some customers complained 
of a slight noise.

<HEADLINE> Crews Clear Wreckage of Derailment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BIRMINGHAM, Mich. (AP) -- Crews today were cleaning up wreckage  
from a freight train derailment in which two cars packed with 
General Motors vehicles burst into flames. 
</P>
<P>
	Only two people were aboard the 97-car Canadian National  
Railroad train on Sunday when more than 40 of its cars jumped the 
tracks. Neither person was injured. 
</P>
<P>
	The accident left crumpled freight cars tipped on their sides,  
and two of the cars burst into flames minutes after the derailment. 
</P>
<P>
	Others had holes torn in their sides where onlookers could see  
new GM trucks tossed about inside. 
</P>
<P>
	Gloria Combes, a Canadian National official, said replacing the  
train's cargo will be ``very costly.'' A precise damage estimate 
wasn't available. 
</P>
<P>
	``Most of those (freight) cars were fully loaded with cars. We  
are very concerned about that,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	The derailment also interrupted Amtrak train service between  
Chicago and Pontiac. 
</P>
<P>
	The engineer was trying to slow down just before the train  
jumped the tracks, said Deputy Birmingham Police Chief Richard 
Patterson. 
</P>
<P>
	``It looks like during that process of slowing down there was a  
lockup of some type, maybe it was an equipment failure of some 
kind,'' Patterson told The Oakland Press of Pontiac. 
</P>
<P>
	Hazardous materials teams responded to the scene because as many  
as five freight cars were carrying toxic materials, but cars were 
later found to be intact, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
	The train was en route from Pontaic to Flat Rock.

<HEADLINE> New Stamp Will Honor Computer Chip </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PORTLAND, Maine (AP) -- A new postage stamp that celebrates the  
computer chip and its impact on society will be unveiled Wednesday 
at a Maine plant that played a pioneering role in the electronics 
industry. 
</P>
<P>
	Four of the eight men who were instrumental in the founding of  
Fairchild Semiconductor at the dawn of the computer age will attend 
the ceremony at the South Portland plant that designed and produced 
the chip, or integrated circuit, featured on the stamp. 
</P>
<P>
	The plant, which opened in 1962, is the world's oldest  
continuously operating plant for the fabrication of integrated 
circuits. 
</P>
<P>
	The computer chip image will appear on one of 15 stamps that  
depict various subjects from the 1960s. The stamps, mounted on a 
decorative sheet, go on sale Sept. 18. Each decade is being 
celebrated by 15-stamp sheets through the Postal Service's 
Celebrate the Century program. Subjects have been selected by a 
national ballot. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're just incredibly honored to have the integrated circuit  
and a Fairchild design selected as one of the top science and 
technology developments of the decade, with the others being man 
walking on the moon and the laser,'' said Fran Harrison, director 
of corporate communications for Fairchild. 
</P>
<P>
	Most stamp unveilings take place in Washington, but the close  
link between Fairchild and the subject of the stamp persuaded the 
Postal Service to hold the ceremony in South Portland, said Robert 
Groff, a spokesman for the Postal Service. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of stamp images aren't that specific to a company,''  
Groff said. ``It's pretty rare and kind of special.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The eight men who played key roles in the founding of Fairchild  
in Palo Alto. Calif., defected from Shockley Labs in 1957 and set 
out to develop products for the Department of Defense. Known in the 
industry as the ``traitorous eight,'' they developed a process for 
mass-producing silicon transistors. 
</P>
<P>
	By 1959, Robert Noyce and other group members developed a  
transistor that was able to put several functions on one plane, 
leading to the development of an integrated-circuit industry. 
</P>
<P>
	The South Portland plant was opened three years later,  
participating in the development and fabrication of integrated 
circuits such as the one pictured on the new stamp. 
</P>
<P>
	Two of Fairchild's original group members, Gordon Moore and  
Noyce, left Fairchild in 1968 to open a company named Intel. Noyce, 
who died in 1990, was married at the time to Elizabeth Noyce, the 
late Maine philanthropist who moved to Bremen after the couple 
divorced in the 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
	Fairchild eventually was purchased by Schlumberger Ltd. and  
later by National Semiconductor, which eliminated the Fairchild 
name in 1989. Eight years later, the company re-emerged as an 
independent entity with its original name. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Pavarotti Settles Tax Evasion Probe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MANNHEIM, Germany (AP) -- Star tenor Luciano Pavarotti has paid a  
six-figure sum as part of a settlement in a German tax evasion 
probe, prosecutors said today. 
</P>
<P>
	Pavarotti, who toured the country with Placido Domingo and Jose  
Carreras, had been named in a tax evasion probe against German 
concert promoter Matthias Hoffmann. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, prosecutors said Domingo had also been dropped from  
the probe after he agreed to pay an undisclosed sum. Carreras' case 
remains open, prosecutors said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hoffmann was charged with funneling huge sums of money for the  
stars and himself to mailbox companies outside Germany. 
</P>
<P>
	A Mannheim court convicted him in December of evading taxes on  
$8 million of income and sentenced him to nearly six years in 
prison. He is free on bail pending an appeal.

<HEADLINE> Mrs. Clinton Urged on Spy Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A Jewish group is demanding that Hillary Rodham  
Clinton take a stand on the explosive issue of whether to free 
Jonathan Pollard, a former Navy intelligence analyst serving life 
as an Israeli spy. 
</P>
<P>
	While the president and first lady attended fund-raisers in the  
Hamptons on Sunday, Assemblyman Dov Hikind, D-Brooklyn, told a 
sidewalk rally the Pollard case is ``certain to become a serious 
issue in the New York Senate contest.'' Mrs. Clinton is weighing 
whether to run for the seat being vacated by Democrat Daniel 
Patrick Moynihan. 
</P>
<P>
	Hikind said Mrs. Clinton should try to persuade her husband to  
grant clemency for Pollard, who has served 14 years in federal 
prison for leaking U.S. military secrets to Israel in the early 
1980s. The Justice Department has rejected previous demands for his 
release. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are pleading with Hillary to impress her husband with the  
humanitarian aspects of a pardon for Jonathan Pollard,'' Hikind 
said. ``Hillary has a lot of work to do in our community, and we 
are watching very carefully. She is for the unity of Jerusalem -- 
very nice. But words alone do simply not work. Action is what will 
count, and I am determined to make this the No. 1 issue in our 
community.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hikind said Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, who is expected to oppose  
Mrs. Clinton in next year's Senate race, supports freedom for 
Pollard. 
</P>
<P>
	In a letter dated Aug. 9, Hikind asked the first lady to  
intervene. 
</P>
<P>
	Howard Wolfson, a spokesman for Mrs. Clinton, declined to  
comment on the letter or Sunday's rally.

<HEADLINE> Riley Tours Southern Schools </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHATTANOOGA, Tenn. (AP) -- When it comes to education, the South  
is on the rise, Education Secretary Richard W. Riley said Monday as 
he began a five-day, five-state bus trip to visit schools in the 
region. 
</P>
<P>
	``The South has made enormous strides in education and we have  
economic prosperity to show for it,'' Riley told a cheering crowd 
gathered at the airport here. The nation's top education 
policy-maker was greeted by Chattanooga Mayor Jon Kinsey and the 
100-member Ooltewah High School band. 
</P>
<P>
	Riley, whose first-time bus tour includes a stop in South  
Carolina, where he once was governor, said the South has emerged as 
a national trendsetter. 
</P>
<P>
	``Many more children are in Head Start. More high school  
students are taking the core curriculum to get ready for college. 
And the South has led the nation in reducing the high school 
dropout rate,'' Riley said. 
</P>
<P>
	Before boarding a large charter coach decorated in yellow to  
resemble a school bus, Riley gave a glimpse of a greater picture, 
saying: ``While my tour has a regional flavor, let's also recognize 
we Americans are about to make some important decisions about our 
nation's future.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``If ever there was a time to be investing in the future, that  
time is now,'' he said, touting Clinton administration initiatives 
to go before Congress this fall. ``This is why we should use our 
nation's budget surplus to protect Social Security, shore up 
Medicare ... and invest in quality education.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He praised a new generation of Southern governors for what he  
called ``pro-education agendas.'' Other Southern governors will 
greet Riley along the way as he visits their schools, some of which 
are running well and others the state has had to take over. 
</P>
<P>
	``What the secretary is going to see in the five states is that  
it's not just where you are, it's where you're going,'' said Mark 
Musick, president of the Southern Regional Education Board, an 
advisory panel to Southern governors in 16 states including the 
ones Riley will visit -- Alabama, Georgia, Tennessee and North and 
South Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's going to sense in these stops some feeling that we're  
making progress, that there's some determination about the 
direction we're moving in,'' Musick said in a telephone interview 
Monday. He will meet the tour later this week in Georgia, where his 
organization is based.

<HEADLINE> Coast Guard Finds Missing Family </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- An Ohio family reported missing at sea two  
weeks ago was found off the Maryland coast in good condition, 
unaware that the Coast Guard was searching the Atlantic seaboard 
for their sailboat. 
</P>
<P>
	Coast Guard officials found the Stewart family and their 65-foot  
boat, the Jolly Joyce, early Sunday 17 miles off Ocean City. 
</P>
<P>
	The family discovered they were the subject of the search when  
they used a cell phone to call their 19-year-old daughter in 
Dayton, Ohio, on Saturday night, said Coast Guard Petty Officer 
Dionne Short. 
</P>
<P>
	The daughter told her family about the search, and then  
contacted the Coast Guard. A Coast Guard ship reached the boat and 
towed it to Ocean City. 
</P>
<P>
	``They had plenty of food and water,'' said Petty Officer Chris  
McLain, who was aboard the ship that found the Stewarts. ``There 
was minor damage to the boat from a storm, but it was definitely a 
seaworthy vessel.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Richard and Debbie Stewart, who were sailing with two of their  
children, had last been heard from nearly four weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The sailboat was reported overdue on Aug. 16 by a family friend,  
prompting a search that covered more than 85,000 square miles from 
Ft. Lauderdale, Fla., to Maine. The search was suspended Aug. 25 
after no trace of the boat was found. 
</P>
<P>
	``Apparently the Coast Guard wasn't looking remotely where we  
were,'' Stewart said. ``They were looking within 50 miles of 
shore.'' But the family boat had been blown up to 300 miles from 
the coast by winds, Stewart said.

<HEADLINE> Sen. Thurmond Released After Surgery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Sen. Strom Thurmond was released from the  
hospital Monday after successful surgery for an enlarged prostate. 
</P>
<P>
	The 96-year-old senator, wearing a business suit, walked out  
Walter Reed Army Medical Center accompanied by his wife, Nancy, and 
daughter Julie. 
</P>
<P>
	His spokesman, John DeCrosta, said Thurmond was in good spirits.  
``He's going back to his home (in Alexandria, Va.), and I don't 
anticipate that he'll swing by the office today.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The South Carolina Republican collapsed at a University of South  
Carolina reception while on congressional recess Aug. 20. He was 
briefly admitted to a hospital in Columbia, S.C., and then 
released. 
</P>
<P>
	He was admitted to Walter Reed two days later complaining of  
fatigue and underwent prostate surgery last Wednesday. The 
procedure was originally scheduled for November. 
</P>
<P>
	Thurmond, the oldest and longest serving senator, spent just  
over a week in Walter Reed's Ward 72, where members of Congress and 
senior military officials are often treated. 
</P>
<P>
	As he left the hospital, Thurmond told reporters he was grateful  
for the support and kindness of his many well-wishers.

<HEADLINE> Cause Sought in Deadly N.J. Ride </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OCEAN CITY, N.J. (AP) -- Roller coasters at the nation's theme  
parks should be considered generally safe despite last week's spate 
of mishaps that left four riders dead, an industry group says. 
</P>
<P>
	``This season has been quite saddening in that regard, and it's  
certainly not normal,'' said Joel Cliff, spokesman for the 
International Association of Amusement Parks and Attractions. ``I 
think it's just a set of coincidences. The industry is 
fundamentally as safe as it's ever been.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The latest accident, which occurred Saturday night at Gillian's  
Wonderland Pier here, killed 39-year-old Kimberly Bailey, of 
Pomona, N.Y., and her 8-year-old daughter, Jessica. 
</P>
<P>
	The victims were ejected from a car on the Wild Wonder ride  
after it suddenly slid backward from a 30-foot ascent and crashed 
into another car, said William Connolly, director of the state 
Division of Codes and Standards, which regulates the rides. 
</P>
<P>
	The accident may have been caused by the failure of an  
anti-rollback device. ``The coaster car should not roll back due to 
this. Obviously, that did not happen as it is supposed to,'' 
Connolly said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Mark Matczak and his two young children were waiting to ride the  
Wild Wonder when they witnessed the crash. Two people also suffered 
minor injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was like, `Oh, my God, it's coming back down,''' said  
Matczak, 39, of Tylersport, Pa. ``As quickly as I said that, it 
hit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Saturday's accident was the latest in a rash of recent  
thrill-ride accidents, and brought to four the number of 
roller-coaster deaths this summer. That's twice the average number 
of amusement park deaths annually, Cliff said. 
</P>
<P>
	A week ago, a disabled 12-year-old boy died on the Drop Zone  
ride at Great America park in Santa Clara, Calif., when he slipped 
out of a harness. 
</P>
<P>
	A day later, a man who had partially wiggled out of a shoulder  
harness fell from the Shockwave, a stand-up roller coaster at 
Paramount's Kings Dominion in Doswell, Va. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, a coaster at Six Flags Marine World in Vallejo,  
Calif., came to a sudden halt and stranded 28 people for nearly 
four hours. And on Thursday, a chain broke on a roller coaster at 
the Cedar Park amusement park in Sandusky, Ohio, with passengers 
aboard. 
</P>
<P>
	No riders were seriously injured in the California and Ohio  
mishaps. 
</P>
<P>
	New Jersey safety investigators spent Sunday inspecting the  
two-story, steel Wild Wonder while the surrounding boardwalk park 
sat closed out of respect for the victims, park officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	The ride, which opened July 1, had been inspected before and  
after it began operating, said E.J. Miranda, a state Department of 
Community Affairs spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
	Its inaugural runs were attended by Gov. Christie Whitman, who  
pressed a button to start the ride, but balked at trying it 
herself. 
</P>
<P>
	New Jersey cracked down on amusement ride operators after a  
number of accidents in 1997, boosting the maximum penalty for a 
safety violation from $500 to $5,000 and making it a crime for 
riders who ignore rules or engage in horseplay on rides. 
</P>
<P>
	The number of serious incidents dropped last summer, from 25 in  
1997 to 16 last year at the state's 1,400 rides. Saturday's deaths 
were the first this year on New Jersey amusement rides, though 
eight people have been seriously injured in ride accidents. 
</P>
<P>
	Park manager Jay Gillian said Sunday his company has hired its  
own safety expert to examine the Wild Wonder, one of 37 on the 
popular amusement pier. 
</P>
<P>
	``Right now we're all shaken,'' he said.

<P>
	ATLANTIC BEACH, N.C. (AP) -- Hurricane Dennis stood off North  
Carolina early today and battered the coastline with torrential 
rains and 80 mph winds, leaving tens of thousands of people without 
power. While a hurricane warning was posted for the entire North 
Carolina coast, the Wilmington area bore the early brunt of the 
storm before bands of heavy rain moved north to the Atlantic Beach 
area. Rain fell at a rate of nearly 3 inches an hour, according to 
National Weather Service. Forecasters expected Dennis to turn 
northeast and skirt the coast today but said it could still cause 
serious problems. At 9 a.m. EDT, Dennis was centered about 85 miles

tensions in Yugoslav province is the ultimate test for the United 
Nations. His statement implied that ethnic Albanian revenge attacks 
against the dwindling Serb population in Kosovo must stop. Ethnic 
Albanians, who have a majority in Kosovo, have been seeking to

The high court overturned an appeals court decision to bar the girl 
from having the procedure performed in Kansas. The girl is said to 
be 24 weeks pregnant. She told authorities she was raped and 
requested an abortion 14 weeks into the pregnancy but then ran 
away, showing up again only recently. No Arizona clinics provide 
abortions after 20 weeks. Late-term abortions in Arizona are

3,000-meter steeplechase at the Aug. 11 Weltklasse meet in Zurich,

<HEADLINE> Ravens Fine Missing McCrary </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OWINGS MILLS, Md. (AP) -- Baltimore Ravens Pro Bowl defensive end  
Michael McCrary missed practice Monday due to a contract dispute 
and will be fined by the team for every day he misses. 
</P>
<P>
	The 29-year-old McCrary, who is in the final year of his  
contract, left Saturday for his home in Phoenix after growing 
frustrated during his efforts to negotiate a contract extension. 
</P>
<P>
	Following practice Monday, Billick said the Ravens will not  
negotiate with McCrary or his agent until he returns to camp. 
</P>
<P>
	``We expect to be dealt with professionally,'' Billick said.  
``We want Michael to be here. I have no doubt in my mind that a 
deal will get done. But we are not going to negotiate with him not 
in camp.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McCrary, who had 14.5 sacks last season, wants a five- or  
six-year deal averaging $7 million a year, including a $13 million 
signing bonus, said his agent, Michael George. 
</P>
<P>
	George met with the Ravens last Friday. The team offered $36  
million over six years with an $11.5 million signing bonus, 
according to The (Baltimore) Sun. 
</P>
<P>
	George rejected it, saying it was below market value.  
</P>
<P>
	``The further this goes along, the further out of control this  
gets,'' George said. ``We're not trying to force them into anything 
except a fair-market deal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McCrary has 35 sacks over his last 38 games and was elected to  
the Pro Bowl as a starter for the first time in his career last 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	But he hasn't played yet in a preseason game as he recovers from  
offseason knee surgery. He was scheduled to play in Friday's 
preseason finale against the New York Giants. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not so much of a distraction,'' linebacker Peter Boulware  
said. ``We'd love to have him here, he really helps our defense. 
But we can't get down because of it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Billick's reaction was similar.  
</P>
<P>
	``I know it's preseason but we're 3-0 and the guys are playing  
hard and he hasn't had a snap yet,'' Billick said. ``Michael 
McCrary is a major part of this football team. He's a major asset 
for us. He is not here right now. He is not a major part of what 
we're doing right now.''

<HEADLINE>  Browns' Chris Spielman Retires </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BEREA, Ohio (AP) -- Chris Spielman never wanted to quit, not as  
he fought to get the feeling back in his arms and legs, and not 
even when doctors told him to retire. 
</P>
<P>
	Spielman never gave in. His body did.  
</P>
<P>
	The intense Cleveland Browns linebacker, who postponed his  
comeback from neck surgery a year ago to care for his family, 
announced his retirement Monday, just two days after a violent hit 
left him momentarily paralyzed. 
</P>
<P>
	Without ever uttering the word ``retired,'' Spielman, his wife,  
Stefanie sitting at his side, ended his stellar 10-year career in 
the same state where he was a household name before leaving high 
school. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would love to keep playing, but I can't jeopardize my legs  
and my arms,'' he said. ``It's difficult. To say no, no more, it's 
hard. But I don't have any regrets. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wish I could be playing but that's not possible. I've been  
very fortunate to be an NFL player. That's the hard part, to wake 
up tomorrow morning and know I'm not an NFL player anymore.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Spielman, who underwent neck fusion surgery in 1997, took a  
crushing, blindside hit from Bears center Casey Wiegmann on 
Saturday night while defending a screen pass in Cleveland's 
exhibition win over Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
	Face down in the grass, his body tingling from head to toe,  
Spielman said he had one thought: ``Get up and get the play 
called,'' he said. ``But I couldn't.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Spielman eventually made it to the sideline under his own power.  
After refusing to get on a stretcher, he was taken to the Cleveland 
Clinic for an MRI, the second he has needed this summer following a 
high-impact collision. 
</P>
<P>
	``He had that first hit in training camp and that scared me,''  
said his brother, Rick, the Bears' director of pro personnel, who 
was in St. Louis that night. ``I told him, `One day you're going to 
take a hit and you're not going to be able to get up.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the second scare, Spielman thought he might be able to  
continue his comeback which he postponed last year while with the 
Buffalo Bills to help take care of his two children after Stefanie 
underwent breast cancer surgery. 
</P>
<P>
	He began weighing his options Sunday morning, walking into  
Browns coach Chris Palmer's office at 8 a.m. for a heart-to-heart 
talk. Convinced he could still play despite an MRI that showed he 
shouldn't, Spielman told Palmer: ``I'm not retiring.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But after consulting with his family, Spielman came to one  
conclusion. 
</P>
<P>
	``Until you have pure medical evidence in front of you, as a  
player your mentality is, `I'll beat this,''' he said. ``But as 
they say in football, the films don't lie, and here the images of 
the MRI don't lie.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And as Spielman showed last year when he stayed home, family  
comes before football. 
</P>
<P>
	``He told me his daughter was at the game and she's 4, 4 1/2,''  
Rick Spielman said. ``She knows that Daddy has a bad neck. When she 
saw him get hit, she just started crying and later she asked him, 
`Daddy, if you're in a wheelchair, does that mean we can't go 
swimming anymore?' That's just the nail in the coffin.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The injury that forced him to retire is unrelated to the fusion  
surgery that interrupted his career in 1997, Spielman said. 
</P>
<P>
	Two vertebrae in Spielman's back are narrowing closer to his  
spinal cord, and each time he took a solid hit, he gets a tingling 
sensation. He had been having occasional bouts with numbness during 
training camp, but didn't tell team doctors. 
</P>
<P>
	``The more you suffer these mini bouts, the more you bruise your  
spine,'' he said, ``the more you take a chance it will never come 
back, and that's what I was doing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Palmer said Spielman has been offered a coaching position with  
the Browns, but had not decided whether to accept it. 
</P>
<P>
	After starring at Massillon High School and later Ohio State,  
Spielman, 33, was regarded as the heart and soul of the expansion 
Browns before they even played their first regular-season game. He 
joined the Browns in February, grateful for a second chance and 
honored to be doing it in his home state. 
</P>
<P>
	``For me as a northeast Ohio kid to play my last game on the  
Cleveland Browns field, in front of Cleveland Browns fans, in a 
Cleveland Browns helmet. You couldn't write it any better,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Spielman was already a football hero in Ohio before he became an  
All-American at Ohio State. At Massillon, where Paul Brown began 
his coaching career, Spielman was a national high school player of 
the year who was so dominant that his picture appeared on a 
Wheaties cereal box. 
</P>
<P>
	Considered too small and short to make it in the NFL by many  
teams, including the Browns, Spielman slipped to the 28th overall 
pick in the 1988 draft, when he was selected by the Detroit Lions. 
He made the Pro Bowl three consecutive seasons for the Lions 
(1989-91), and then again in '94. 
</P>
<P>
	Following the '95 season, he signed as a free agent with the  
Bills. In '96, he led the team with 206 tackles. 
</P>
<P>
	Always around the football, Spielman seemed to be in on every  
tackle. And when he wasn't planting his face mask in a running 
back's chest, he was causing some kind of havoc near the line of 
scrimmage. 
</P>
<P>
	``I enjoyed it,'' he said. ``I told somebody when I leave the  
game I'll leave with no regrets and not sadness because I did it 
the way it was supposed to be done and I did it every single day. 
It's someone else's turn now.''

<HEADLINE> Scientists Meet To Show Off Robots </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- Scientists are learning to make robots that do  
what they're supposed to do when they're supposed to do it. Now if 
only human beings would play along. 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers from all over the world gathered Sunday at Carnegie  
Mellon University to show each other the latest in robots made to 
help their human masters. 
</P>
<P>
	One common problem: making the programmed machines work  
alongside unpredictable human nature. 
</P>
<P>
	For example, a team of scientists at Carnegie Mellon is working  
on robots that serve as museum guides. The technology could 
eventually be used to build robot nurses. 
</P>
<P>
	But kids at the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C., had  
other ideas when a robot named Minerva debuted there last summer -- 
they jumped on Minerva and tried to take it for a ride. 
</P>
<P>
	To make sure people respected Minerva's space, designers gave it  
a voice and moving mouth and eyebrows. 
</P>
<P>
	``I need to get through,'' the robot said, frowning at  
Smithsonian guests who dawdled in front of it. Minerva smiled at 
those who moved. 
</P>
<P>
	People responded, said Sebastian Thrun, a Carnegie Mellon  
assistant computer science professor working on the museum robots. 
</P>
<P>
	Thrun's conclusion: People like it when machines interact with  
them. Now he's using that theory when building other robots. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the technology spotlighted Sunday is not yet available  
commercially, but researchers are hopeful. 
</P>
<P>
	Among those looking for corporate sponsorship was Gerard Lacey,  
a designer from Ireland's Trinity College. His team tested robots 
to help blind and elderly people who don't have the strength to 
walk with canes or guide dogs. 
</P>
<P>
	The robot, which resembles a lawn mower, allows blind people to  
walk holding its handles for support. They point the robot in the 
direction they want to go, and its built-in sensors slow it down 
and stop it from hitting walls. 
</P>
<P>
	The robot became popular quickly at a nursing home where it was  
tested. 
</P>
<P>
	``Life in a nursing home is very regimented,'' Lacey said.  
``There's a time for bingo, there's a time for tea. There's a time 
for whatever. Now there was a time to walk around. They guarded it 
very jealously.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meeting older people's needs called for some adjustments, Lacey  
said. At one point the robot had a joystick like those used in 
arcade games, which had to change. 
</P>
<P>
	``Elderly people have never used a joystick in their life,'' he  
said. ``It's probably not going to be a successful interface for 
them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Other robots unveiled Sunday included a wheelchair that  
automatically finds its way through shifting crowds. Once the chair 
is programmed to move in a given direction, the person sitting in 
it can ride with hands folded as the chair charts the movements of 
people nearby, chooses a path around them and moves at normal 
walking speed. 
</P>
<P>
	Another robot tracked people's eye movements. One of the  
designers, Alex Zalinski of Australian National University, said it 
could be used in cars to make sure drivers are keeping their eyes 
open and on the road, even if they move their heads or change the 
lighting in the car.

<HEADLINE> 17,300 Work Lights Recalled </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Around 17,300 work lights were recalled Monday  
because of fire, shock and electrocution hazards. 
</P>
<P>
	The Consumer Product Safety Commission recalled more than 16,000  
florescent work lights distributed by Wilmar Corp. of Kent, Wash. 
The lights have wiring that cannot carry adequate wattage. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, about 1,300 work lights made by Foremost Tool Co.,  
also of Kent, Wash., have undersized wiring, inadequate grounding 
systems and faulty plugs that can be dangerous. 
</P>
<P>
	No injuries have been reported, commission spokeswoman Kim Dulic  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Foremost and Wilmar imported the product from the same  
manufacturer in Taiwan, she said. Each product contains a 
florescent bulb encased in a clear plastic tube with yellow caps on 
both ends. 
</P>
<P>
	The Wilmar light was sold for about $24 by automobile parts  
stores nationwide from April 1992 until last month. Buyers should 
return the light to the store for a refund, or call (800) 426-1262 
for information. 
</P>
<P>
	Foremost sold the $13 work light in hardware stores in the  
Northwest from July 1992 until last month. Buyers should return the 
light or call (800) 448-8184 for information.

<HEADLINE> Proposed Arco, BP Amoco Merger Ok'd </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Atlantic Richfield Co. shareholders on Monday  
approved the company's proposed merger with BP Amoco, a deal that 
would create the world's second-largest oil company. 
</P>
<P>
	Shareholders of BP Amoco were scheduled to meet Wednesday in  
London to consider the $29 billion acquisition. 
</P>
<P>
	Executives of Arco and BP Amoco agreed last April to the merger,  
which still must be approved by the Federal Trade Commission and 
the European Commission. 
</P>
<P>
	Arco shareholders will receive .82 BP Amoco American Depository  
share for each share of Arco. 
</P>
<P>
	Arco, battered by more than a year of record-low crude oil  
prices, began looking for a merger partner last year. The company 
began negotiating with BP Amoco in January. 
</P>
<P>
	``BP Amoco's scale and financial strength will significantly  
enhance the value of Arco's assets and allow greater value to be 
realized than if Arco remained an independent oil company and gas 
company,'' Mike Bowlin, Arco's chairman and chief executive, told 
shareholders. 
</P>
<P>
	BP Amoco executives have said they expect the deal to bring  
about $1 billion a year in cost savings. 
</P>
<P>
	Arco stock fell 25 cents to close at $86.12 1/2 on the New York  
Stock Exchange, while BP Amoco shares were unchanged at $110.37 1/2.

<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- The U.S. Soccer Federation invited Iran to play a  
match in the United States, a spokesman said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``There have been ongoing discussions between the two  
federations,'' spokesman Brian Remedi of the U.S. Soccer Federation 
said. ``We would like to play a match in the U.S. sometime next 
year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Remedi said the Iran-U.S. match in the 1998 World Cup was a good  
one and the federation would like to have the U.S. team play the 
Iranians again. Iran eliminated the United States from the World 
Cup with a 2-1 victory. 
</P>
<P>
	An exchange of gifts between players from the two teams that day  
won the countries the 1998 fair-play prize from world soccer's 
governing body, FIFA. 
</P>
<P>
	Remedi said talks were still preliminary.

<HEADLINE> Innocent Plea Entered for Furrow </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- A judge entered an innocent plea on Monday  
for the white supremacist who allegedly confessed to killing a 
Filipino-American postal worker and shooting up a Jewish community 
center full of children. 
</P>
<P>
	Buford O. Furrow Jr. stood between his lawyers, Sean Kennedy and  
Marilyn Bednarski, as they stated they did not intend to enter a 
plea. 
</P>
<P>
	Magistrate judge Stephen Hillman then entered one for Furrow.  
</P>
<P>
	The family of slain letter carrier Joseph Ileto sat across the  
courtroom. Ileto, 39, was shot to death on Aug. 10. Although the 
arraignment was for that killing, the government could add hate 
crimes allegations that would encompass the wounding of five 
people, including three children, the same day at the Jewish 
Community Center in suburban Granada Hills. 
</P>
<P>
	Furrow faces separate state charges of attempted murder in that  
shooting. The district attorney's office also filed a murder charge 
in the Ileto killing and added hate crime allegations against 
Furrow. 
</P>
<P>
	Both state and federal charges carry a potential death penalty.  
</P>
<P>
	Experts have suggested that Furrow will have a defense based on  
mental illness.

<HEADLINE> Riley To Tour Southern Schools </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Proving that back-to-school time isn't just  
for kids, Education Secretary Richard Riley is hopping on a big 
yellow bus, although a plushier one than the nation's children 
ride. 
</P>
<P>
	Riley and a 60-member entourage of education leaders,  
officeholders and reporters will log 500 miles in a five-state, 
five-day tour through the South this week to open the school year 
with the message that good schools equal a good economy. 
</P>
<P>
	``A high-quality education is the key to economic growth,'' said  
Riley, who noted that more than half the nation's job growth in the 
last 10 years has been in the South. 
</P>
<P>
	Returning to his roots, the former South Carolina governor hopes  
his visits to Tennessee, Alabama, Georgia, South Carolina and North 
Carolina will link the region's booming economy to its school 
reform efforts. 
</P>
<P>
	North Carolina, for instance, has more teachers certified by a  
voluntary national board aimed at producing ``master teachers'' 
than any other state. Georgia is guaranteeing that universities 
will retrain classroom teachers if school systems don't think they 
are doing well, so long as the teacher is teaching in the field he 
or she studied. 
</P>
<P>
	Riley was flying to Chattanooga, Tenn., tonight to board a bus  
that will take him to 10 schools, from preschool to college. In 
past years, he marked the ``back-to-school'' ritual in late summer 
and early fall with plane trips to dozens of schools, where he read 
to children or explained Education Department policies to their 
teachers. This week, only the mode of transportation is different. 
</P>
<P>
	The two-bus caravan, dubbed the Success Express, consists of  
air-conditioned, 35-passenger executive coaches covered with yellow 
vinyl and black trim, rather than the standard school models. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm taking this trip to get a firsthand look at the progress  
that has been made, and at what can be done to get ready for the 
future,'' Riley said this month when he released record school 
enrollment numbers. 
</P>
<P>
	Highlights of the bus tour include a rally Tuesday afternoon in  
Chattanooga for the launch of the Mars Millennium Project -- a 
program to help schoolchildren nationwide learn about science 
through designing a Mars colony. 
</P>
<P>
	Later Tuesday, the tour will celebrate a reading program in  
Birmingham, Ala., and highlight parental involvement at Litchfield 
High School in Gadsden, Ala., the first school in Alabama to fall 
under state control. 
</P>
<P>
	Stops later in the week include Atlanta, Greenville, S.C.,  
Charlotte, N.C., and Fort Mill, S.C. 
</P>
<P>
	Aides said Riley, 66, wanted to do something special for the  
approaching millennium as the Clinton administration winds down. He 
plans to call attention to administration initiatives such as 
increased funding for school construction and new teacher hires to 
reduce class sizes. 
</P>
<P>
	This fall, Congress considers a 34-year-old law that governs the  
bulk of federal education spending. Republican leaders, planning a 
similar bus tour through Indiana, Kentucky and other states, are 
pushing their own education programs that emphasize tuition tax 
breaks for parents and more direct control of funding by the 
states. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't doubt Secretary Riley's desire to improve education,  
but he needs to explain what's missing in American education is 
accountability,'' said Nina Shokraii Rees, education policy analyst 
for the Heritage Foundation, a conservative Washington think tank.

<HEADLINE> Bradley Woos New Hampshire Workers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BERLIN, N.H. (AP) -- Rural New Hampshire business leaders told  
Bill Bradley on Monday that the government should do more to help 
workers who have not benefitted from the country's recent economic 
prosperity. 
</P>
<P>
	Minutes later, the Democratic presidential candidate was across  
town, sitting on a stack of hemlock two-by-fours at a sawmill and 
delivering the same message. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can't be pleased about an economy that's growing unless it  
helps people all over the country,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Like northern New York, Maine and Vermont, northern New  
Hampshire's economy has struggled this decade under the waning 
influence of the pulp and paper industries. New England mills, 
using outdated equipment, must compete with companies in Brazil, 
Finland and Japan that turn out paper more quickly and under fewer 
environmental regulations, said Preston Gilbert, executive director 
of the economy-minded North Country Council. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley said he wants to help the region adjust to a new,  
information-based economy -- possibly with the establishment of a 
regional development authority that would cross state lines. 
</P>
<P>
	John Simpson, a northern New Hampshire industry analyst with the  
state Department of Resources and Economic Development, said the 
North Country does not have the roads or infrastructure needed to 
attract and keep businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no way we can financially keep up,'' Simpson said.  
``We don't even have the same capacity as the southern part of our 
own state.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The government can help by getting the big things right, Bradley  
said: balancing the budget, keeping international trade open, 
having the lowest tax rates for the most people, and spending money 
on education and research. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley did at least as much listening as talking, taking  
questions from high school basketball players in Groveton and about 
30 workers at White Mountain Lumber in Berlin. 
</P>
<P>
	Campaign spokesman Tony Wyche said Bradley has been trying to  
win support by showing voters respect. 
</P>
<P>
	The method -- and the message -- are working, said Randy Lawrence  
of Berlin, an employee of White Mountain Lumber. 
</P>
<P>
	``He made more sense than the other ones, the other  
candidates,'' Lawrence said. ``He sounds pretty good to me.''

<HEADLINE> Feds Seek Reason for Crane Collapse </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MILWAUKEE (AP) -- Federal officials want to know why and how  
contractors were using a crane-hoisted platform that held three 
workers killed when another crane collapsed at the Milwaukee 
Brewers' future stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	The so-called ``man basket'' held the three ironworkers near the  
stadium roof when the accident happened July 14. 
</P>
<P>
	The 567-foot crane, called Big Blue, collapsed when it was  
trying to lift a 400-ton section of roof in place at the unfinished 
stadium, called Miller Park. 
</P>
<P>
	Regulations of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration  
strongly discourage the use of man baskets, but don't ban them, the 
Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reported in a story for Monday's 
editions. 
</P>
<P>
	The use, position and other details of the man basket that held  
the three workers who died are under investigation, George Yoksas, 
area administrator of OSHA, said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are looking at the propriety of that,'' Yoksas said.  
</P>
<P>
	Under OSHA rules, the baskets can be used only if alternatives  
are considered more hazardous or impossible to use ``because of 
structural design or work site conditions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Alternatives include ladders, hoists, aerial lift trucks and  
elevated work platforms, according to OSHA. 
</P>
<P>
	Man baskets were the only practical way for workers to help  
direct the placement of stadium roof panels, said Franklyn Gimbel, 
a lawyer for Mitsubishi Heavy Industries of America, the stadium 
roof contractor. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, Gimbel said there was no call to abort the lift by the  
three workers killed. 
</P>
<P>
	Violation of the OSHA rule on man baskets carries fines of  
$7,000 to $70,000. Yoksas said he had reached no conclusions yet. 
</P>
<P>
	Yoksas said OSHA would not have a report on the causes of the  
accident in the next few weeks, despite earlier indications that it 
might. He said he could give no time frame for release of any 
report. 
</P>
<P>
	By law, OSHA must release a report within six months of an  
accident.

<HEADLINE> Cocaine Seized in Fish Shipment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- Nearly 3,000 pounds of cocaine was discovered  
hidden beneath a shipment of iced fish filets from Ecuador, and 
customs officials say it may be another inside smuggling job at 
Miami International Airport. 
</P>
<P>
	The Arrow Air cargo flight landed early Monday from Guayaquil,  
Ecuador, with 50 cardboard boxes. An estimated 2,720 pounds of 
cocaine, worth an estimated $21 million, was wrapped neatly in 
waxed paper packages hidden beneath filets of grouper, congrio and 
tuna. 
</P>
<P>
	The drugs showed up in an X-ray during a routine inspection.  
</P>
<P>
	``We have reasons to believe people at the airport may have been  
involved,'' said customs agent John Clark. ``With that much cocaine 
and nobody coming to claim it, especially at that hour, it 
indicates to us that whoever is involved knew about the seizure.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The seizure comes less than a week after 58 people were charged  
with smuggling drugs and weapons at the airport, many of whom 
worked for American Airlines. Clark did not say the two incidents 
were linked, but said there were similarities. 
</P>
<P>
	No one was charged, though the investigation was continuing.  
</P>
<P>
	In a statement, Miami-based Arrow Air, Inc. said it has often  
been an active partner with the customs service in thwarting 
smugglers.

	Dennis Batters N.C. Coastline  
</P>
<P>
	ATLANTIC BEACH, N.C. (AP) -- Hurricane Dennis has begun veering  
seaward while drenching North Carolina's coastline with rain and 
92-mph winds, knocking out power to upwards of 50,000 people. At 
noon EDT, Dennis was centered 90 miles southeast of Cape Lookout, 
or 105 miles east of Wilmington, and was moving toward the 
east-northeast at about 15 mph. Its maximum sustained wind blew at 
about 100 mph. Two people were killed in a head-on collision blamed 
on the wind and rain about 7:30 a.m. in the coastal Onslow County 
community of Richlands. Southport received 8 inches of rain, 
according to the National Hurricane Center.

	East Timorese Vote on Independence

<P>
	DILI, Indonesia (AP) -- Thousands of East Timorese cast their  
ballots today on whether to remain under Indonesian rule or gain 
independence. U.N. officials estimated that 90 percent of 
registered voters cast ballots. Although U.N. officials said the 
voting was relatively peaceful, a member of the U.N. team 
overseeing the election, Joel Lopez Gomes, was killed on his way 
home from a polling station. Indonesia invaded East Timor nearly a 
quarter-century ago, after Portugal ended a reign of nearly 400 
years. Human rights groups claim 200,000 people have died in the 
ensuing violence.

	CDC: Decline in AIDS Deaths Slowing  
</P>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- The sharp decline in AIDS deaths that began two  
years ago with the development of powerful new drugs has suddenly 
been cut in half, raising questions about whether the medications 
are already losing their punch, health officials said today. AIDS 
killed 17,047 people in the United States last year -- a decline of 
20 percent from 1997. From 1996 to 1997, the drop in deaths was a 
much more dramatic 42 percent, which health officials attributed to 
the effectiveness of new drugs. The CDC listed several possible 
causes for the slowdown in reductions of AIDS deaths, including the 
patients' failure to keep up with their medication.

people to tune in to its recruitment efforts. The Army is studying 
a number of alternatives to recover from what has been the worst 
recruiting year since 1979, an Army spokesman said. The slogan has 
been used by the Army since 1981. But the spokesman stressed that 
the Army doesn't blame the slogan, and acknowledged that the good 
economy and the fact that more young people are going to college 
after high school are bigger factors for the falloff.

today that the Russian space station may spin out of control now 
that they have left it unmanned. The crew was not replaced because 
the cash-starved Russian government has said it could no longer pay 
for the 13-year-old Mir's operation. But instead of bringing the 
Mir down with the crew, space officials decided to leave it 
orbiting the Earth in hopes that they can find private funds to 
keep it aloft. Failing that, Russia plans to gradually lower the 
craft, then allowing it to burn up in the atmosphere, with it 
remnants ending up in the Pacific Ocean.

	Survey Says Job Prospects Are Good

	NEW YORK (AP) -- A new survey suggests U.S. demand for workers is  
continuing at the highest level in two decades, with employment 
especially strong in the wholesale and retail trades in advance of 
Christmas. A quarterly survey of some 16,000 companies by Manpower 
indicated that 30 percent planned further hiring in the 
October-December quarter. Just 8 percent anticipated cutbacks, 
while 58 percent said they expected no change. The findings by 
Manpower suggest that strong job creation should continue to hold 
U.S. unemployment in check. The nation's unemployment rate has been 
at or below 4.5 percent for more than a year, the best showing in 
three decades.

	NAGS HEAD, N.C. (AP) -- North Carolina residents breathed a sigh  
of relief as Hurricane Dennis turned out to sea today. ``We are 
hoping it continues that offshore track,'' said Jim Jones, 
spokesman for the state Division of Emergency Management. The 
shoreline was visited by 112 mph gusts and a deluge that flooded 
streets and left tens of thousands without power. Two traffic 
deaths early today were blamed on the storm. At 8 p.m., Dennis was

<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- The drop-off in AIDS deaths since the  
introduction of powerful drug cocktails has slowed dramatically, 
raising questions about whether the combination of medicines is 
reaching the limits of what it can do. Statistics released today at 
the first national conference on AIDS prevention showed that the 
decline in deaths slowed to 20 percent from 1997 to 1998, as 
compared to a 42 percent drop from 1996 to 1997. The CDC blamed the 
slowdown on a lack of treatment for some, the difficulty others 
have in sticking to the complicated regimen of pills, and the 
emergence of drug resistant strains of the virus.

the FBI's about-face last week after years of claims that only 
non-burning tear gas was used in the final hours of the deadly, 
51-day siege. Attorney General Janet Reno and the FBI have said 
there is no evidence that the incendiary devices lobbed at a

	CDC: AIDS Deaths on Decline  
</P>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- A sharp decline in AIDS deaths since 1995 has  
only widened the gap between how the disease affects blacks -- who 
now make up nearly half those killed by AIDS -- and other racial 
groups. New figures released by the Centers For Disease Control and 
Prevention show that AIDS killed 17,047 people in the United States 
last year -- a 20 percent decline from 1997. But the more deaths 
have dropped, the more blacks with AIDS move toward becoming the 
majority of those who die, the CDC said Monday during the first

	NAGS HEAD, N.C. (AP) -- Hurricane Dennis turned out to sea,  
sideswiping the shoreline with 112 mph gusts and a deluge that 
flooded streets and left tens of thousands without power. The 
storm's center started peeling away from the coast after getting no 
closer than 60 miles. Two traffic deaths early Monday were blamed

$217,000, while in Brunswick County, the collapse of a beachfront

said Cecil Logan of the county emergency management office. Still, 
forecasters warned the danger wasn't over.

	JERUSALEM (AP) -- With pressure mounting for a deal before this  
week's arrival of U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, 
Israeli and Palestinian negotiators said Monday they were on the 
verge of agreement on the long-delayed Wye River peace accord. But 
in a development that could complicate negotiations, the bodies of 
an Israeli couple were found in a forest on the border with the 
West Bank on Monday. Police suspected they were killed by 
Palestinians, raising worries of a resurgence of anti-Israeli 
violence.

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A House committee Monday subpoenaed records  
for its investigation of the FBI's admission that incendiary tear 
gas canisters were used in the government's fiery 1993 standoff 
with the Branch Davidians. Congressional Republicans are incensed 
over the FBI's about-face last week after years of claims that only 
non-burning tear gas was used in the final hours of the deadly, 
51-day siege. Attorney General Janet Reno and the FBI have said 
there is no evidence that the incendiary devices lobbed at a 
concrete bunker 40 yards from the Davidians' compound ignited the 
fire that later raced through the wooden structure.

<HEADLINE> Shares Grow After IAAF Cuts Barmasai </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEVILLE, Spain (AP) -- Kenyan steeplechaser Bernard Barmasai's  
disqualification from the Golden League on Monday could mean a 
bigger payday for the three remaining contenders when track action 
resumes this week. 
</P>
<P>
	American sprinter Marion Jones, 800-meter record-holder Wilson  
Kipketer of Denmark, and distance runner Gabriela Szabo of Romania, 
stand to benefit the most from the International Amateur Athletic 
Federation's decision to make Barmasai ineligible for the $1 
million Golden League jackpot. 
</P>
<P>
	With only two of seven Golden League meets remaining -- in  
Brussels on Wednesday and Berlin on Sept. 8 -- the jackpot is 
currently shared by the trio. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones, however, is not expected to compete in Brussels after  
being forced out of last week's world championships when back 
spasms caused her to collapse to the track in her 200-meter 
semifinal. 
</P>
<P>
	Suddenly, Szabo and Kipketer stand to split the $1 million  
bonus. The jackpot is shared among athletes who remain unbeaten in 
the seven Golden League events. 
</P>
<P>
	The remaining contenders were guaranteed bigger pieces of the  
pie Monday when the IAAF ruled Barmasai brought the sport ``into 
disrepute'' by saying he asked countryman Christopher Koskei not to 
challenge his lead late in the 3,000-meter steeplechase at the 
Weltklasse meet in Zurich, Switzerland on Aug. 11. 
</P>
<P>
	``I saw he was trying to pass me. I said `leave it for me,' and  
that's why he slowed down,'' Barmasai said at a press conference 
following his win. He also hinted that, if successful in his quest, 
he would share the winnings with Koskei. 
</P>
<P>
	Koskei denied hearing Barmasai speak to him, adding it would be  
impossible to speak at that stage in the race. 
</P>
<P>
	The IAAF decided to allow Barmasai to continue to race on the  
Golden League circuit but make him ineligible to share in the 
season-ending jackpot. This means that Barmasai, who has won all 
five of his Golden League races so far, would remain empty-handed 
even if he wins his final two events. 
</P>
<P>
	The sport's world governing body also considered stripping  
Barmasai of his victory in the race but let the result stand, 
seeing no evidence of wrongdoing on a video replay. 
</P>
<P>
	``On the video you don't see Barmasai ever trying to speak to  
Koskei,'' IAAF spokesman Giorgio Renieri said. ``They are never 
within two meters of each other and it would be impossible for them 
to speak. An agreement would have been impossible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But in an audio tape recording of the victor's press conference,  
the Kenyan clearly stated that Koskei let him win, Renieri said. 
</P>
<P>
	It is for this statement and not because of an actual  
transgression on the track that Barmasai is being sanctioned, the 
IAAF said. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is why he is being punished,'' Renieri said. ``What he  
says put athletics into disrepute. It gives the public the idea 
that some races can be fixed when this is not true. 
</P>
<P>
	``The code of conduct states that athletes who put the sport  
into disrepute can be sanctioned in some way.''

<P>
	CEDAR RAPIDS, Iowa (AP) -- Independent telephone company

of the company. 
</P>

</P>
<P>
	Shares of McLeodUSA's rose 4 percent on the news, jumping $1.25

<HEADLINE> CompUSA Makes Late Earnings Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- CompUSA announced the immediate layoffs of 1,800  
sales people Monday as it struggles to return to profitability amid 
declining prices for personal computers. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dallas-based retailer also reported that it lost money again  
in the quarter ended June 26, however, operating losses were less 
than Wall Street had expected -- $14.9 million, or 16 cents a share. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts surveyed by First Call had estimated the company would  
lose 24 cents a share in the quarter. A year ago, the company lost 
19 cents a share. 
</P>
<P>
	Chief executive Jim Halpin acknowledged that the past year has  
been a difficult one for the chain but said he was pleased with 
progress of a company restructuring that was announced in June. 
</P>
<P>
	CompUSA is trying to shed its image as a PC store and become a  
consumer electronics destination, selling more handheld personal 
organizers, digital cameras and camcorders, DVDs and other consumer 
gear. 
</P>
<P>
	The shift was prompted by plummeting average prices for PCs. The  
company said its average sales price for desktop PCs dropped about 
7 percent in the most recent quarter, and the average sales price 
of notebook computers dropped more than 5 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of CompUSA closed down 50 cents, or 7 percent, to $6.68 3/4  
on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	The earnings report had been delayed nearly two weeks while the  
company finished details of several restructuring efforts, 
including the sales layoffs, which will be spread throughout the 
company's stores. They bring CompUSA's total job cuts since June to 
2,400, and Halpin said another 300 are imminent. 
</P>
<P>
	The layoffs are part of an effort to move sales agents out of  
local stores to regional locations. The company said putting the 
agents in stores led to duplication in markets where the chain has 
more than one store. 
</P>
<P>
	Some analysts saw hopeful signs beyond the most recent quarterly  
losses. 
</P>
<P>
	``With a company as much in transition as CompUSA is, what's  
important is the direction they're headed,'' said Harry Katica, an 
analyst for Prudential Securities. ``I think they're reacting 
appropriately to very difficult industry circumstances.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The company has closed four stores and Halpin said another 10  
``marginal'' stores could be closed. ``We've told the store 
managers, 'Fix it or we're going to fix you.''' 
</P>
<P>
	The retailer reported net sales in the fourth quarter of $1.46  
billion, up 23 percent over a year ago, but sales at stores open 
one year or more rose just 1 percent. Sales at former Computer City 
stores, which CompUSA acquired, are still lagging, company 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	For the 1999 fiscal year, the company reported an operating loss  
of $54.2 million, or 50 cents per share, compared with operating 
income of $57.2 million, or 33 cents per share for fiscal 1998. 
Sales in stores open at least a year fell 3.4 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials also said they hope to spin off an Internet  
subsidiary, CompUSA Net.com Inc., first with a private offering and 
later a public offering. Halpin said the company will retain 
majority interest in the Internet operation even after a public 
sale of stock.

<HEADLINE> European Stocks Lower Overall </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) --Plans for a major French supermarket merger pushed  
the European retail sector higher, but shares overall were lower 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones Stoxx Index of 592 European companies closed down  
0.4 point at 314.57, while the Dow Jones Euro Stoxx Index, which 
tracks 297 companies in countries joining the single currency, 
ended down 0.6 point at 329.34. 
</P>
<P>
	French supermarket group Carrefour said Monday it was acquiring  
rival Promodes in a friendly stock deal that would create the 
world's second-largest retailer and a European counterweight to the 
biggest -- Wal-Mart Stores Inc. of the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	France's CAC-40 index of most actively traded French stocks rose  
0.3 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal was regarded as likely to spur a wave of European  
mergers as Wal-Mart seeks to expand on the Continent and retailers 
look for partners. The news had a strong ripple effect throughout 
Europe's retailing sector. Stocks soared as investors tried to 
guess which store operators would consolidate. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares in Spain's largest listed supermarket groups -- Centros  
Comerciales Continente and Centros Comerciales Pryca -- closed 
strongly higher on the news that their French parents are to merge. 
Pryca rose 12.1 percent while Continente rose 12.3 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The merger's effects were also felt in Italy, where retailer  
Rinascente closed up 2.1 percent. Ifil, the Agnelli family's 
holding company, which owns 51 percent of Eurofind, which in turn 
owns 60 percent of Rinascente, was unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
	Metro, Germany's largest retailer, was the biggest gainer on the  
DAX index with a 2.2 percent rise. 
</P>
<P>
	One decliner was Dutch retailer Ahold, which would lose its  
number one ranking in Europe after the French merger. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones Euro Stoxx 50 Index finished down 15.7 points at  
3,837.8, while the DJ Stoxx 50 Index closed down 14.1 points at 
3,775.5. 
</P>
<P>
	Among domestic markets, Frankfurt's Xetra Dax closed down 27.83  
points, or 0.5 percent, at 5,392.53, while Amsterdam's AEX ended 
down 0.53 points at 584.36 points. 
</P>
<P>
	Milan's MIB30 index of blue chips closed at 3,4371, down 0.5  
percent, or 170 points, while the broader Mibtel fell 0.4 percent, 
or 87 points, at 23,984. 
</P>
<P>
	Madrid's IBEX-35 closed down 0.5 percent, or 52.20 points, at  
10,006.20. London's market was closed for a bank holiday.

<HEADLINE> French Retailers Announce Merger </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PARIS (AP) -- French supermarket groups Carrefour SA and Promodes  
announced a friendly merger today that will create the world's 
second-largest retailer, behind Wal-Mart Stores Inc. of the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
	The combined operation will have a market capitalization of $49  
billion and annual sales of nearly $50 billion, much smaller than 
Wal-Mart, which had sales of $138 billion last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Carrefour said it was offering six shares for one of Promodes, a  
statement from both companies said. 
</P>
<P>
	The offer was announced by Carrefour President Daniel Bernard  
and Promodes President Paul-Louis Halley at a joint news conference 
in Paris. 
</P>
<P>
	Wal-Mart's expansion into the United Kingdom and Europe has put  
pressure on European retailers. The U.S. company, based in 
Bentonville, Ark., is expected to target France soon. 
</P>
<P>
	Halley said that ``taking into account the speed of  
consolidation in the retail sector, this linkup comes at the right 
time, and is without doubt the best possible for each of the two 
companies.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Halley, whose family has 52.7 percent of Promodes' voting  
rights, said he has recommended that Promodes shareholders support 
Carrefour's offer. 
</P>
<P>
	Promodes is a leading food retailer in Europe, with its strength  
in Spain. Carrefour operates superstores selling everything from 
food to clothes to car batteries. It is strong in Asia and Latin 
America. 
</P>
<P>
	The combined group would operate in 26 countries with 9,000  
stores, including 680 superstores and 2,600 supermarkets. It will 
employ 240,000 people, about half in France. 
</P>
<P>
	The fusion of Carrefour and Promodes is the latest example of  
merger mania that has gripped France this year, particularly in the 
banking and oil sectors.

<HEADLINE> Tokyo Stocks Fall in Midday Trading / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Japanese stocks fell sharply Tuesday morning,  
weighted down by a decline on Wall Street and further weakness in 
the dollar against the yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average shed 287.72 points,  
or 1.61 percent, to 17,631.25 at the end of the morning session. On 
Monday, the average closed up 319.60 points, or 1.82 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 110.78 yen, down 0.26 yen from late Monday in  
Tokyo but higher than its late New York level of 110.73 yen. 
</P>
<P>
	On the stock market, Tokyo share prices started lower as  
investor sentiment was damped by another fall in New York and the 
weaker dollar. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones industrial average lost 176.04 points to close  
Monday at 10,914.13, declining for the third consecutive session. 
</P>
<P>
	The latest Japanese economic report showing worse-than-expected  
industrial production figures was also weighing on Japanese stock 
prices, traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Ministry of International Trade and Industry said production  
fell 0.6 percent in July from June after adjustment for seasonal 
factors. Economists surveyed by Dow Jones Newswires had projected 
on average that industrial output would be up 0.2 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section was down 5.90 points, or 0.39 percent, to 1,492.04. 
The TOPIX closed up 19.56 points, or 1.32 percent, the day before. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency dealings, the dollar moved as high as 110.95 yen  
early in the session after the Japanese government released the 
industrial output data. 
</P>
<P>
	But the greenback's gains were quickly pared on expectations the  
yen will strengthen as Japan's overall economy heads for recovery. 
</P>
<P>
	In other currencies, the euro was traded at 116.16 yen, up from  
116.09 yen late Monday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on the benchmark 10-year Japanese government bond fell  
to 1.9500 percent from Monday's finish of 1.9850 percent, driving 
its price up to 99.58 yen from 99.29 yen.

<HEADLINE> Forbes To Run Anti-Gore Ad in N.Y. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Republican presidential hopeful Steve Forbes  
began airing a radio commercial Monday that criticizes Vice 
President Al Gore's role in U.S.-Russia relations and demands an 
apology to Americans for sending U.S. aid to Russia. 
</P>
<P>
	``Russia remains an economic and political time bomb,'' says an  
announcer. ``Immediately block all foreign aid to Russia until her 
workers are paid and root out the corruption of Russia's robber 
barons.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Vice President Gore and Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers  
owe the American taxpayer an apology'' for foreign aid sent to 
Russia, says the ad, running this week in the upstate New York area 
where President Clinton is vacationing with his wife, Hillary 
Rodham Clinton, and their daughter, Chelsea. 
</P>
<P>
	The ad decries Mafia influence on the nation's finances that  
cost Russian workers wages. In addition to U.S. aid, it attacks 
lending by the International Monetary Fund, which the United States 
could prevent. It contends such aid could be diverted to illegal 
uses. 
</P>
<P>
	Another ad the Forbes campaign released Monday focuses on the  
recent $792 billion tax cut plan approved by Congress. Forbes 
encourages President Clinton to follow Congress' lead. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sign the tax cut, Mr. President,'' Forbes says. ``I would.''  
</P>
<P>
	Forbes campaign officials have said in the past that the  
campaign is spending $10 million on nationwide ads this summer. A 
spokesman said that these ads are part of that spending.

<HEADLINE> Fires Char 200,000 Acres Out West </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Fast-moving wildfires fanned by erratic winds  
have charred more than 200,000 acres of brush and timber from 
Washington to southern California, destroying buildings and forcing 
thousands to evacuate. 
</P>
<P>
	Firefighters, meanwhile, mourned the death of one of their own.  
</P>
<P>
	Joseph Masto, a Santa Barbara firefighter, was found dead in  
steep terrain in Los Padres National Forest. He was acting as a 
medic for firefighters working against a 180-acre blaze north of 
Santa Barbara. Search crews found Masto's body Saturday after he 
didn't return to camp. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was just a great guy,'' said Michael Kotowski, a battalion  
chief with the Santa Barbara Fire Department. ``He had a lot of 
potential. This may have been his first wildfire.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The cause of death was not immediately known. There was no  
evidence of burns. 
</P>
<P>
	A 17,000-acre fire north of Lake Arrowhead destroyed one home  
and burned 30 other structures, said Nanci Wagner, a spokeswoman 
for the California Department of Forestry. It was not immediately 
known what kind of structures were damaged, Wagner said. 
</P>
<P>
	Flames threatened some high-voltage power lines and underground  
gas lines this morning, causing concern that additional fires could 
flare up, Wagner said. 
</P>
<P>
	The rapidly moving blaze, called the Willow fire, started  
Saturday near the resort, about 85 miles northeast of Los Angeles, 
and was fueled by strong winds and high temperatures. Residents 
were evacuated Sunday to a nearby high school, said Melody Lardner, 
a spokeswoman for the U.S. Forest Service. 
</P>
<P>
	Two firefighters suffered minor injuries battling the blaze in  
the San Bernardino National Forest, Lardner said. The brush fire 
was caused by an illegal camp fire, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Another fire that ignited Sunday in rugged terrain north of  
Azusa in Angeles National Forest charred 1,000 acres of brush, oaks 
and pine and forced 4,000 people from their homes. 
</P>
<P>
	In Riverside County, a wildfire that started Saturday afternoon  
burned about 2,500 acres by late Sunday night and forced the 
evacuation of two campgrounds and a trailer park, Lardner said. 
</P>
<P>
	Some 450 Los Angeles County firefighters also battled a brush  
fire that broke out Sunday afternoon near Palmdale. The fire, which 
had burned across 1,500 acres by early this morning, destroyed 
three outbuildings and partially burned a home. 
</P>
<P>
	A series of blazes in northern California charred 32,914 acres  
and burned 14 outbuildings, two vehicles and a boat. Two major 
fires that burned nearly 17,000 acres were surrounded, and 
firefighters gained the upper hand on three others. 
</P>
<P>
	``The best news is that we're very slowly getting containment  
around most of the fires,'' aid Alleah Haley, a fire information 
officer for the California Department of Forestry in Butte County. 
``The bad news is that we're expecting 20-30 mph winds. We're 
holding all our resources, hoping for the best and being prepared 
for the worst.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A fire in the Stanislaus National Forest was contained after  
burning 4,028 acres, but officials kept about 1,000 firefighters on 
the scene to fight hot spots. 
</P>
<P>
	In Nevada, crews had contained the largest fire, 45,000 acres  
north of Reno, but a blaze 80 miles southwest of Ely had burned 
10,000 acres and was still raging. And in Washington state, smaller 
fires near the Columbia River and Major Creek were under control by 
Sunday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	Light rain helped firefighters tackling several small,  
lightning-sparked fires in Oregon. A 1,500-acre fire near the Warm 
Springs Indian Reservation in north-central Oregon was fully 
contained Saturday.

<HEADLINE> Injuries Take Toll on NFL Teams </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	St. Louis lost its starting quarterback for the season, and the  
NFL might have seen the last of one of football's most intense 
players. 
</P>
<P>
	Saturday night's exhibition games provided trainers around the  
league with plenty of work, as a number of players went down with 
injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	St. Louis Rams quarterback Trent Green tore the anterior  
cruciate ligament in his left knee, sustained a third-degree sprain 
of the medial collateral ligament and also had cartilage damage in 
a 24-21 victory over San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
	Cleveland linebacker Chris Spielman could announce his  
retirement today after sustaining a ``stinger'' during the Browns' 
35-24 win over Chicago when he was blindsided by Bears center Casey 
Wiegmann while trying to cut back on a screen play. 
</P>
<P>
	Other significant players injured in Saturday night's games were  
New Orleans starting quarterback Billy Joe Hobert, Miami running 
Cecil Collins and New York Giants center Brian Williams. 
</P>
<P>
	Reconstructive surgery on Green's knee will be scheduled when  
the swelling subsides in about 2-3 weeks. Dr. Robert Shively, the 
Rams' physician, estimated the recovery period at 13 months. 
</P>
<P>
	The injury occurred when Chargers strong safety Rodney Harrison,  
blitzing on the play, lunged at the back of Green's knees just 
after a pass was thrown. Green completed all 11 of his attempts 
before the injury. 
</P>
<P>
	``I knew it was gone,'' Green said. ``I just felt it grind and  
snap. I heard the whole thing. It was a very uncomfortable 
situation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kurt Warner, an NFL Europe and Arena Football League veteran who  
has just one quarter of NFL experience, became St. Louis' starter 
by default. The team also acquired Paul Justin from Oakland as 
insurance Sunday, giving up a seventh-round pick in next year's 
draft. 
</P>
<P>
	Spielman, attempting a comeback from neck fusion surgery in  
1997, might retire after a violent helmet-on-helmet collision sent 
him to the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	After shedding and spinning off one blocker, Spielman turned and  
before he could get his feet planted, Wiegmann crushed him. 
</P>
<P>
	Spielman stayed on the ground for several moments, and later  
told Cleveland offensive tackle Lomas Brown, who also played with 
him in Detroit, that he had been momentarily paralyzed. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's exploring all of his options,'' said Browns coach Chris  
Palmer, who spoke to Spielman twice on Sunday. ``He's going to look 
at everything and go from there. What we want to do is sit back 
take a look at things, let things settle down for 24 hours both 
emotionally and physically and then talk about the subject at that 
time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He got a scare in training camp when he was blasted by fullback  
Tarek Saleh, a blow that sent him to the hospital for an MRI. 
</P>
<P>
	Chicago lost backup defensive tackle Jimmy Herndon for the  
season with a torn ACL in his left knee. 
</P>
<P>
	Hobert is expected to miss the Saints' final preseason game  
after fracturing one of his ribs. 
</P>
<P>
	Hobert completed 10 of 15 passes for 179 yards and two  
touchdowns before a helmet to his right side fractured the rib. 
</P>
<P>
	``It shouldn't be that big a deal,'' Hobert said, although he  
admitted he was in pain just standing still. ``If they wanted me to 
play in the next game, I could as long as I wore a protective rib 
vest.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Saints plan to hold Hobert out of Thursday's preseason game  
against Tennessee and have him ready for the opener against 
Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
	Miami was relieved to learn tests showed Collins had no break in  
his injured right ankle, giving him a chance to heal for the season 
opener. 
</P>
<P>
	Collins, the Dolphins' fifth-round draft pick, will be on  
crutches for a few days and miss Thursday's game at Green Bay. 
There's a possibility he could be ready when Miami opens the season 
Sept. 13 at Denver. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm glad it wasn't serious,'' said Collins, who leads the team  
with 34 carries and 144 yards. ``I'm going to work hard with the 
trainers to do everything I can to try and get ready as soon as 
possible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	An MRI exam showed Collins aggravated an injury Collins  
sustained two years ago at LSU. Collins broke his right leg and 
damaged ankle ligaments in an October 1997 game against Vanderbilt. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams, attempting a comeback after missing two seasons with  
an eye injury, sprained his left knee in the first half of a 16-10 
loss to the New York Jets. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams' injury doesn't appear to be that serious, coach Jim  
Fassel said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	The veteran center had an MRI and there appears to be no  
structural damage. While Fassel is optimistic, he would not say 
when Williams will be back until he speaks with Dr. Russell Warren, 
the team's orthopedic surgeon.

<P>
	X-rays were negative on Dan Wilkinson's dislocated left ring  
finger. The defensive tackle is not expected to miss any practice 
time. 
</P>
<P>
	Defensive end Kenard Lang could be out for a week after  
spraining an ankle. 
</P>
<P>
                              *Eagles    	
</P>
<P>
	Starting quarterback Doug Pederson said he should be back on the  
field the next day or so after suffering a lower back contusion in 
the third quarter of Thursday's 17-13 loss to the Minnesota 
Vikings. 
</P>
<P>
	``It feels great,'' Pederson said following treatment on his  
back Sunday. ``I took today off to help it heal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pederson was hit in the back by a Vikings linebacker when he  
jumped on the ground after scrambling with the ball. 
</P>
<P>
                              *Ravens    	
</P>
<P>
	Baltimore isn't making much headway in their contract talks with  
Pro Bowl defensive end Michael McCrary, who reportedly left the 
team over the weekend after discussions over a possible extension 
reached an impasse. The Ravens, however, insisted that McCrary 
never informed them of that decision. 
</P>
<P>
	McCrary underwent offseason knee surgery and wasn't supposed to  
play Saturday anyway. The players were given Sunday off, so McCrary 
won't be considered AWOL until today, when he is scheduled to begin 
practice for Friday's exhibition finale against the New York 
Giants. 
</P>
<P>
                             *Panthers    	
</P>
<P>
	Carolina waived linebacker Horace Cook, defensive tackles  
Chartric Darby and Jerome Davis, offensive tackle Jeffrey Flowe, 
wide receiver Terry Guess, offensive guard Michael Lies, linebacker 
Sam Manuel, defensive end Andre Slappey and running back Reggie 
Shufford.

<HEADLINE> Bad Breath Hot Line Alerts Offender </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- How do you tell your friend, your co-worker  
or your spouse that he or she has bad breath? 
</P>
<P>
	Leave it to a trained professional.  
</P>
<P>
	A new service by the Center for Breath Disorders allows people  
to send an anonymous -- and tactful -- message breaking the news. 
</P>
<P>
	The free letter -- which can be sent via e-mail or U.S. mail --  
explains that bad breath is a common problem and that it is not 
always the result of poor oral hygiene. The message then directs 
the user to a Web site selling a $40 fresh-breath system created by 
Philadelphia dentist Jon L. Richter, who founded the Center for 
Breath Disorders in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is such a taboo subject that people who have the problem  
or people who know other people who have the problem rarely bring 
it up, even with a spouse,'' Richter said Monday. ``We thought it 
would be great for people to communicate anonymously with others 
that they have a breath odor problem and that it is very simple to 
correct.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The letter says: ``Someone close to you who cares has requested  
that we forward this information to you. We understand the 
difficulties a person faces in both their personal and professional 
lives due to a breath odor problem. ... You're not alone.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tracy Gillett of Albuquerque, N.M., contacted the hot line about  
a co-worker. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is not like their fly is down and it is an immediate need  
or that it will eventually correct itself. It is an ongoing 
problem, one that is giggled about and discussed behind their back 
but not ever said to their face,'' Ms. Gillett said. 
</P>
<P>
	Some people have thanked the center for the advice. ``They say,  
`I don't know who did it, but I appreciate the tip,''' Richter 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Some e-mails complaining about bad breath offenders demonstrate  
why it's better to leave the letter writing to a trained 
professional. 
</P>
<P>
	``Her breath reeks. It smells like a 3-hour-old used baby  
diaper,'' one person wrote. Another said: ``Please, please, please, 
for the good of humanity and my own nostrils, please tell this 
person that their breath is kickin' like Bruce Lee.'' 
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Thais See 3 Pct. GDP Growh for 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) -- Thailand's economy and currency, which  
triggered Asia's financial crisis, will grow stronger in 2000 after 
recovering this year, economic ministers were told Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Economic and Social Development Board, a state  
planning agency, forecast gross domestic product would grow by 3 
percent in 2000. The International Monetary Fund has predicted 
growth of between 3 and 4 percent for 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile the baht should trade at between 36 and 37 to the U.S.  
dollar next year, compared with the current exchange rate of 38.3 
baht to the dollar, the NESDB said. 
</P>
<P>
	Predictions of sustained growth follow two years of sharp  
contraction after the onset of the crisis in mid-1997, when the 
baht was floated and plunged from 26 to the dollar to as low as 56 
in early 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Speaking after the economic ministers' meeting, government  
spokesman Akapol Sorasuchart said the board expected consumer 
prices, a benchmark measure of inflation, to grow by 3 percent next 
year, compared with 0.5 percent this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Thailand should have a trade surplus in 2000 equal to 5 percent  
of GDP and a current account surplus of $8.2 billion, the board 
said.

<HEADLINE> Japan's Auto Production Falls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Japan's auto production fell for the fourth month  
in a row in July, registering a 3.6 percent decline from a year 
earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	A total of 887,288 cars, trucks and buses rolled off the  
assembly lines last month, compared with 920,776 a year ago, the 
Japan Automobile Manufacturers' Association said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	It attributed the fall to continued sluggish consumer demand for  
big-ticket items and falling exports. The association estimated 
vehicle exports in July fell 10 percent. It will release complete 
figures later this month. 
</P>
<P>
	The July drop in production follows a 2.5 percent decline in  
June, a 2.4 percent decline in May and a 6.5 percent tumble in 
April. 
</P>
<P>
	Domestic vehicle demand in July totaled 537,616, down 3.8  
percent from a year earlier, the group said.

<HEADLINE> Bengals' Moore Can Walk With Help </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CINCINNATI (AP) -- Cincinnati Bengals safety Kelvin Moore is able  
to get out of his hospital bed and walk with help from physical 
therapists as he recovers from a broken bone in his neck, the team 
said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Moore, 24, sustained the career-threatening injury Aug. 20 at  
Pontiac, Mich., as he tackled a Detroit Lions player in a preseason 
game. The injury was diagnosed as a fractured vertebra in his neck. 
</P>
<P>
	He is recuperating at the University of Southern California  
Hospital in Los Angeles, near his family home, and is expected to 
remain at the hospital for several weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	Moore has feeling in his arms and legs and is expected to make a  
full recovery, said Dr. Robert Heidt Jr., the Bengals' team 
physician. It is not known whether Moore will ever play football 
again. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, the Bengals placed him on injured reserve. Cincinnati  
signed Moore in 1998 as a rookie free agent from Morgan State. He 
spent most of the season on the practice squad, but saw limited 
action in the Bengals' final four games.

<HEADLINE> Loftin's Dream Comes Crashing Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) -- All Ryan Loftin ever wanted was to play  
football for Iowa. 
</P>
<P>
	When Iowa didn't offer him a scholarship, Loftin joined the team  
as a walk-on. He endured a year as practice fodder for the varsity, 
stuck with it, earned a scholarship and eventually became a starter 
at defensive end. It was a textbook case of hard work being 
rewarded -- until it all came crashing down. 
</P>
<P>
	Now Loftin, whose scholarship was lifted earlier this month,  
stands accused of extortion for allegedly threatening to expose 
NCAA rules violations and provide information on the team to Iowa 
opponents. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know what's going on,'' Ron Book, who was Loftin's  
football and track coach at Waukee High School, said Monday. ``I 
would like to think it's not true. It just doesn't make sense.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Former Iowa defensive coordinator Bob Elliott also is puzzled.  
Elliott, who coached the Hawkeyes' defensive ends, saw Loftin work 
his way through the ranks to become a player good enough to start 
all 11 games last season. 
</P>
<P>
	``He did it through hard work and being a reliable guy,'' said  
Elliott, now an assistant to the athletic director at Iowa. ``The 
way he came is a very difficult row to hoe. He was a good team guy. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm very disappointed it's happened like this, that it went  
this far,'' Elliott said. 
</P>
<P>
	Loftin was charged with extortion, a felony punishable by up to  
five years in prison and a $7,500 fine, and fifth-degree theft, a 
misdemeanor. 
</P>
<P>
	According to charges filed by the Johnson County attorney's  
office, first-year Iowa coach Kirk Ferentz received a letter signed 
by Ryan Loftin that threatened to expose NCAA rules violations and 
share information about the football team to opponents if Loftin's 
scholarship was not restored. 
</P>
<P>
	The letter also said other disgruntled former players would be  
enlisted to generate negative publicity about Ferentz and the 
football program. 
</P>
<P>
	The theft charge alleges that Loftin took notebooks belonging to  
the athletic department. It is punishable by up to 30 days in jail 
and a $100 fine. 
</P>
<P>
	Loftin, who had been listed as a second-team linebacker on the  
preseason depth chart, quit the team Aug. 17 and Ferentz lifted his 
scholarship. Three days later, Loftin called reporters to claim he 
had been run off and that Ferentz had violated NCAA rules by 
conducting mandatory offseason workouts, claims that Ferentz 
denied. 
</P>
<P>
	Loftin's attorney, Leon Spies, said his client would plead  
innocent. Spies also said he felt the case could have been handled 
without the filing of criminal charges. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's devastating to any young person and that person's family  
to be charged with a felony regardless of the circumstances,'' 
Spies said. ``It just struck me this was a situation where some 
other creative avenues might have been explored by the university 
and they weren't. 
</P>
<P>
	``Not that Ryan is entitled to any better treatment than any  
other student, but if they really had his best interest at heart, 
some other approach might have been taken.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Spies said that perhaps Ferentz ``wanted to draw a line and make  
a statement.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``But it seems like it could have been done without involving  
the court system,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Loftin appeared before a magistrate Saturday morning and was  
released. He is to be arraigned on the theft charge Sept. 9. A 
preliminary hearing on the extortion charge is Sept. 17. 
</P>
<P>
	``I regret the whole thing,'' said Ann Rhodes, Iowa's vice  
president for university relations. ``I wish like crazy none of 
this would have happened. Personally, I'd like very much to stop 
talking about it, but this is where we are.''

<HEADLINE> Asian Stock Markets Close Mixed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONG KONG (AP) -- Asian stock markets closed generally mixed  
Monday, with prices surging in Tokyo and Hong Kong despite last 
week's slump on Wall Street. 
</P>
<P>
	The Japanese benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average rose  
319.60 points, or 1.82 percent, to rebound from a four-day slump 
and close at 17,918.97. On Friday, the average fell 66.92 points, 
or 0.38 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The buying spree in Tokyo came came after the Nikkei average had  
fallen a total of 634.18 points in the previous four trading days. 
</P>
<P>
	Short-term players bought actively, expecting that major local  
investment trusts will start buying Tuesday to set up funds 
totaling an estimated 60.0 billion yen ($541 million). 
</P>
<P>
	In currency trading, the U.S. dollar fell on selling by U.S.  
funds in the belief that U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Alan 
Greenspan seemed concerned about stock values. 
</P>
<P>
	Greenspan said on Frday that the extraordinary rise in U.S.  
stock prices over the last five years has been mostly inexplicable. 
Those remarks pushed the Dow Jones industrial average down 108.28 
points, or 1 percent, to close at 11,090.17 on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar was quoted at 111.04 yen, down 0.40 yen from late  
Friday in Tokyo and also below its late New York level of 111.56 
yen on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Hong Kong stocks surged Monday following news that the territory  
has pulled out of a deep recession. 
</P>
<P>
	The Hang Seng Index, the Hong Kong market's key indicator of  
blue chips, rose 305.53 points, or 2.3 percent, to 13,688.66. On 
Friday, the index had slumped 225.25 points, or 1.67 percent. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> AT&AMP;T Cuts Long-Distance Rates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- AT&AMP;T Corp. battled back against phone rivals on  
Monday by slashing long-distance rates to just 7 cents a minute for 
calls made any time. While the rates are bargains for frequent 
long-distance callers, average users might wind up paying more, not 
less, consumer groups warned. 
</P>
<P>
	People who sign up for AT&AMP;T's cheap rate must pay an additional  
$5.95 a month. Sprint, which helped trigger the price war early 
this month, charges the same monthly fee for a rate of 5 cents a 
minute at night, and 10 cents at other times. 
</P>
<P>
	MCI WorldCom also offers weekend and weekday nighttime rates of  
5 cents a minute, with daytime fees that go up to 10 cents a 
minute. Its monthly fee is $4.95. Another MCI plan charges just 
$1.95 a month, but daytime rates jump to 25 cents a minute. 
</P>
<P>
	The deals are great for callers who make 200 minutes or more of  
long-distance calls a month, industry experts say. AT&AMP;T says these 
users can save up to 20 percent off what they'd pay using 
traditional plans. 
</P>
<P>
	But the average residential customer makes about 80 minutes of  
calls a month, according to the Federal Trade Commission, too 
little to compensate for the monthly fees charged by AT&AMP;T and, in 
many cases, Sprint and MCI as well. AT&AMP;T's customers on the average 
make even fewer calls, according to industry analysts. The company 
would not break out how many of its customers are infrequent 
callers. 
</P>
<P>
	AT&AMP;T's plan is ``a pretty darn good price for those who are on  
the right side of the road,'' said Samuel Simon, chairman of the 
Telecommunications Research and Action Center, a Washington-based 
consumer group. But ``these plans are only aimed at the top end of 
the market, heavy users.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, AT&AMP;T insisted that its plan had wide benefits. Under the  
company's old plan, AT&AMP;T had charged 15 cents a minute around the 
clock with no monthly fee or 10 cents a minute with a $4.95 fee. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've developed a plan that is pegged to a significant  
percentage of our customer base,'' said Gene Lockhart, president of 
AT&AMP;T consumer services. 
</P>
<P>
	While MCI offers a $1.95 monthly fee, people who don't regularly  
check their watch may end up paying the far higher rate of 25 cents 
a minute. 
</P>
<P>
	The new prices are seen as a precursor to an industry push to  
change how it charges customers for phone calls, phasing out 
per-minute rates and instead pressing for monthly fees, just like 
Internet access. Consumer groups oppose the proposal on grounds 
that reductions in long-distance charges will not offset monthly 
increases for most customers. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the criticism, the lower prices for the industry's best  
customers are stealing revenues and producing jitters on Wall 
Street. Following AT&AMP;T's announcement on Monday, the company's 
stock price dropped 3 percent, falling $1.50 a share at $46 on the 
New York Stock Exchange. MCI WorldCom also was down 3 percent, 
falling $2.43 3/4 a share at $76.06 1/4 on the Nasdaq Stock Market. 
Sprint dropped 5 percent on the NYSE, falling $2.37 1/2 a share to 
$44.75. 
</P>
<P>
	AT&AMP;T said its long-distance business, which has steadily lost  
revenues to rivals in recent years, should drop more than expected 
in the third quarter because of the price wars, but recover 
somewhat by the end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	AT&AMP;T said its financial results for the full year should meet  
the expectations of Wall Street analysts due to surprising growth 
in its wireless and other promising businesses. Hoping to further 
boost its mobile-phone business, AT&AMP;T unveiled a promotion that 
lets up to five family members make unlimited wireless calls to 
each other and to their home phone inside their calling region. 
</P>
<P>
	Overall, AT&AMP;T's revenue is expected to grow between 5 percent  
and 7 percent, with per-share profits between $2.13 and $2.20. 
</P>
<P>
	While AT&AMP;T's new 7-cent-a-minute rates appear steeper than  
offers introduced early this month from MCI and Sprint, the company 
is hoping that customers will find its plan easier to use because 
it offers the same price no matter what time it is. 
</P>
<P>
	That simplicity will be AT&AMP;T's selling point in a television and  
print advertising campaign that breaks this week. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's amazing how complicated this industry can make saying,  
'Hello,''' AT&AMP;T chairman Mike Armstrong said during a 
teleconference Monday.

<HEADLINE> Hurricane Inconvenient, Not Disaster </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MOREHEAD CITY, N.C. (AP) -- As her little brother played Go Fish  
nearby with a pack of homemade cards, Cara Crowley pulled out her 
laptop to peck out the first lines of an essay about how she spent 
her summer vacation. 
</P>
<P>
	```Today we're stuck in an old high school,''' the 9-year-old  
Fredericksburg, Va., girl read aloud Monday as she sat on the floor 
in the lobby of West Carteret High School. 
</P>
<P>
	The storm forced her family to flee their rented condo at  
Atlantic Beach on Bogue Banks island, about 25 miles from Morehead 
City. ```The hurricane came,''' she wrote. ``'We couldn't have 
picked a better target.''' 
</P>
<P>
	But compared to past North Carolina hurricanes like Fran, Bonnie  
and Bertha, Hurricane Dennis missed the mark. For all the 
inconvenience he caused, Dennis was little more than a blowhard. 
</P>
<P>
	``A mullet blow is what we call this,'' Jeff Turnage, a line  
serviceman for Carolina Power &AMP; Light Co., said as he surveyed 
downed power lines on Atlantic Beach. ``Just a lot of wind and 
rain.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although some residents of North Carolina's fragile Outer Banks  
were surprised by the high winds and rain, there was a sense that 
things could have been a lot worse to the south along the Crystal 
Coast. 
</P>
<P>
	In Morehead City, an empty tin grain silo on U.S. 70 blew down,  
and the Sanitary Fish Market lost its awning and some roof. Down 
the road at the 60s and 70s Museum, a plywood cutout of late rocker 
Jim Morrison took a ride on the storm. 
</P>
<P>
	Ty Hood ventured out onto a pier at Nags Head and said it was a  
rough trip. 
</P>
<P>
	``The wind's blowing 50 mph and I weigh 220 and it was blowing  
me around,'' Hood said as winds toppled a sign at a convenience 
store across the street. 
</P>
<P>
	By midday Monday in Morehead City, people were already venturing  
into the trash- and limb-strewn streets. On the waterfront, neither 
Jeremy Coy of Newport nor his children, Summer and Aaron, seemed 
impressed by Dennis. 
</P>
<P>
	``This one right here has been slack,'' Coy said.  
</P>
<P>
	Cara's father, Bob Cowley, fretted over why just about every  
other island on the coast was under a mandatory evacuation, but 
theirs was not. He wanted to get his money back for the condo they 
had to abandon two days into a five-day vacation. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some of the condos out there have clauses that you get a  
refund ONLY when it's a mandatory evacuation,'' he said. ``Well, 
we're going to have a chat.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cara just clutched her Curious George doll and said thanks for  
the one day of kite flying and surf strolling they had. And she was 
thinking of how her story would end. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'll probably end it that it's better to go back next summer  
than not go back at all,'' she said. ``Better safe than sorry, I 
guess.'' 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Reno Faces GOP Criticism Over Waco </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Attorney General Janet Reno's Republican  
critics in Congress say new revelations about the 1993 Branch 
Davidian standoff bolster their arguments that Reno and her Justice 
Department have not been forthright with the American people. 
</P>
<P>
	Her Democratic defenders warned against politicizing the matter  
of whether -- contrary to past claims -- the FBI used incendiary tear 
gas grenades in the final hours before the Davidians' compound near 
Waco, Texas, went up in flames. 
</P>
<P>
	``Pointing fingers or demonizing the attorney general of the  
United States who has come forward this week serves us no 
purpose,'' Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee, D-Texas, said Sunday on CNN's 
``Late Edition.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Reno said Thursday she was ``very, very troubled'' by newly  
received information that pyrotechnic devices may have been used on 
the last day of the 51-day siege, in which more than 80 people 
died. She said she and FBI Director Louis Freeh had ordered a full 
review of the case. 
</P>
<P>
	Danny Coulson, the former FBI official who first disclosed last  
week that at least two incendiary grenades were fired, said today 
it seems clear that the devices did not start the fatal fire. But 
he said an outside investigation is necessary. 
</P>
<P>
	Reno ``should recuse herself and see that we do an investigation  
that is objective and not charged with emotion and fair,'' Coulson 
said on ABC's ``Good Morning America.'' ``I don't think the 
Department of Justice for perception purposes should do its own 
inquiry.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Reno and other Justice Department and FBI officials have  
stressed that the military-type incendiary grenades were fired at 
an underground bunker away from the main wooden building but had 
nothing to do with the fire that broke out hours later and 
destroyed the compound. 
</P>
<P>
	They said there was solid evidence that Branch Davidian leader  
David Koresh and his followers set the fires that killed more than 
80 people. 
</P>
<P>
	On Sunday, Justice Department spokesman Myron Marlin reiterated  
Reno's own anger at the new revelations. ``She had asked for and 
received assurances that these devices would not be used and were 
not used,'' he said. ``It is extremely frustrating, and that's why 
she plans to get to the bottom of this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Byron Sage, a retired FBI agent and chief Waco hostage  
negotiator, said on NBC's ``Meet the Press'' that while it was 
``very troubling'' that information on the incendiary grenades is 
only surfacing now, ``this was not a cover-up, this was not any 
grand conspiracy or anything else. What it was was a very glaring 
oversight.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Rep. Dan Burton, R-Ind., chairman of the House Government  
Reform Committee, said he didn't trust Reno and ``that's why my 
committee is going to do a very thorough investigation of this 
whole matter.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Burton said he would issue subpoenas this week to the Justice  
and Defense departments. ``I intend to have depositions taken from 
all those people and put them under oath,'' he told NBC. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, said he  
also planned investigations into Waco. The GOP presidential hopeful 
said on ``Fox News Sunday'' that Reno has generally been stingy in 
imparting information to Congress, and he complained of a ``lack of 
cooperation from the leadership of the Justice Department. ... I 
don't think they have much credibility at this particular point.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Burton and Hatch have clashed frequently with Reno over what the  
Republicans call the lack of Justice Department cooperation in 
congressional investigations into White House scandals, Democratic 
fund raising and alleged Chinese espionage. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would not surprise me if Janet Reno tried to keep a lid on  
this because I think she has done that in other areas,'' Burton 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	But Reno was defended by Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., who told  
NBC that he had ``real faith in her integrity.'' But Schumer also 
said she should seek an independent, outside investigation rather 
than have the FBI or Justice Department look into the incendiary 
device matter. 
</P>
<P>
	``The FBI had its chance to do this investigation on its own.  
They clearly muffed it,'' Schumer said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sage and former agent Bob Ricks, the FBI spokesman during the  
Waco crisis, also played down disclosures that officers from the 
Army's secretive Delta Force anti-terror unit were on the scene at 
Waco. 
</P>
<P>
	Ricks, on ABC's ``This Week,'' said the FBI had long coordinated  
with the Army on hostage and rescue missions, and the Delta 
officers were there only as occasional observers and advisers. 
``They very much were properly there,'' he maintained. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Michael Caddell, a lawyer for families of Branch  
Davidian members, told ABC that a military presence at a civilian 
police operation violates the law.

<HEADLINE> Researchers Seek Sleep Syndrome Gene </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A sleep syndrome that sends people early to  
bed and early to rise doesn't necessarily make them healthy, 
wealthy and wise. The disorder, traced to a single gene, can send 
sufferers to bed when everybody else is still going strong, 
researchers at the University of Utah have found. 
</P>
<P>
	Understanding what governs people's wake-sleep cycles has  
important medical implications for dealing with insomnia, jet lag, 
shift work and depression, the scientists report in the September 
issue of the journal Nature Medicine. 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers studied people who have a shorter than normal  
wake-sleep cycle. Regardless of work schedules or social pressures, 
these folks just can't stay up much later than 8:30 p.m. and they 
tend to wake up around 5:30 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
	It's called ``familial advanced sleep-phase syndrome'' because  
it shifts the normal wake and sleep pattern forward by three to 
four hours. 
</P>
<P>
	Louis Ptacek and colleagues found 29 people in three families  
with the disorder. One family included a grandmother, daughter and 
grandchild all with the same sleep disturbance. 
</P>
<P>
	The normal population contains plenty of ``morning lark'' and  
``night owl'' people who function better at different times of day, 
but people with this syndrome are not simply morning people, Ptacek 
emphasized. 
</P>
<P>
	Most creatures seem to operate on a biological clock  
approximately synchronized to a 24-hour day. This rhythm controls a 
variety of daily biochemical and behavioral cycles including 
fluctuations in sleep and wakefulness. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a situation which is quite comparable to the changes  
that occur normally in aging humans,'' Ptacek said. ``Most aged 
humans, starting around age 65 or 70, show these sorts of changes, 
reporting problems sleeping, usually marked by earlier onset to 
sleep ... frequent waking in the night. But this is a genetically 
linked trait, not simply aging, as it appears at an earlier age,'' 
Ptacek explained 
</P>
<P>
	For people with this syndrome the cycle is shorter and the  
constant conflict between their body clock and coping with the rest 
of the world leads to their shifted sleep-wake rhythm. 
</P>
<P>
	``These aren't diseases per se, and most people just live with  
this sleep pattern and never see a doctor about it,'' Ptacek said. 
Some cope with it fairly well, but it can be disabling for others. 
</P>
<P>
	By studying the family relationships the scientists found that  
the disorder is inherited in a way common to other inherited traits 
caused by a single gene, such as eye color. 
</P>
<P>
	So now Ptacek's team is working to identify the specific gene  
responsible. Finding the gene could lead them to the protein it 
produces to cause the body's time shift -- a discovery that could 
then lead to the development of drugs to treat not only the sleep 
disorder, but jet lag and other conditions. 
</P>
<P>
	But, said Ptacek, ``we need to understand the normal biology  
first. Then we can work on altering the clock and helping people 
who fly or do shift work.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Presumably, this protein is just one of the gears in the  
(body) clock. By studying one gear we can get a handle on the other 
gears around it and we may get an insight about why they have this 
trait and how the normal clock functions,'' he said in a telephone 
interview. 
</P>
<P>
	The search for the gene may be arduous.  
</P>
<P>
	``There are approximately 80,000 genes in human genome, this is  
a single one of those 80,000. Think of the genome as a library with 
80,000 books and we're looking for a spelling error in a single 
book,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	His report was greeted with enthusiasm.  
</P>
<P>
	``I think this is a really exciting finding,'' said David  
Earnest of Texas A&AMP;M University, who studies the cell biology of 
the circadian clock that regulates sleep and wake patterns. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the first time that anyone has identified a  
genetically inherited trait that involves the expression and 
control of the circadian rhythm in humans. That's really 
critical,'' Earnest said in a telephone interview. 
</P>
<P>
	What researchers have been looking for in humans is either a  
disease or mutation that is directly associated with a variant 
circadian rhythm, he explained. They want to learn how that affects 
mental health and to understand its role in problems such as jet 
lag and seasonal affective disorder -- better known as winter blues 
-- which is common in northern areas.

<HEADLINE> Cigarette Packs To Jump 22 Cents </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RICHMOND, Va. (AP) -- Smokers already hit hard by price increases  
stemming from the $206 billion tobacco settlement soon will be hit 
with another double-digit markup. 
</P>
<P>
	The nation's leading cigarette manufacturers have raised  
wholesale prices 18 cents a pack, anticipating an upcoming excise 
tax increase and higher costs associated with their settlement with 
the states over health care costs. 
</P>
<P>
	After markups, retail prices are likely to increase by about 22  
cents per pack, analysts said Monday. Cigarettes now cost about 
$2.50 to $3.25 a pack, depending on the region of the country. 
</P>
<P>
	Philip Morris USA, the world's biggest tobacco maker, initiated  
the increase last Friday. Competitors matched the increase, which 
had been expected but came earlier than some analysts had 
predicted. 
</P>
<P>
	Retail prices are likely to increase immediately in some  
outlets, such as newsstands, where cigarettes are generally sold 
per pack. Increases may take longer at tobacco-only stores, said 
Morgan Stanley Dean Witter analyst David Adelman. 
</P>
<P>
	Spokesmen at Philip Morris, Brown &AMP; Williamson Tobacco Corp.,  
and R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Holdings Inc. all confirmed the increase 
but refused to comment further. A spokesman at Lorillard Tobacco 
Co. did not return phone calls. 
</P>
<P>
	The price increase announced Friday to wholesalers is the second  
largest in industry history, behind a 45-cent increase last 
November. That increase followed a $206 billion settlement with 46 
states suing the industry to recover costs of treating ill smokers. 
The industry previously settled for $40 billion with the four other 
states. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, the industry faces further cost increases, including a  
10-cent increase in the federal excise tax set for Jan. 1, and an 
increase in settlement expenses from about 46 cents per pack to 
about 50 cents, Adelman said. 
</P>
<P>
	The remaining 4 cents of the price increase amount to a real  
increase in cigarette prices, or the amount the industry would 
normally have raised prices, Adelman said. 
</P>
<P>
	Roy Bury, an analyst at Brown Brothers Harriman, said experience  
with past price hikes indicates this increase of about 8 percent is 
likely to decrease demand by only about 2 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	``It clearly shows that the industry has the ability to offset  
higher costs with higher prices,'' Bury said. ``The key factor here 
is that profit per unit for domestic tobacco continues to go up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The increase will have a significant impact on demand, Adelman  
said, but overall revenues will still increase. 
</P>
<P>
	``The industry has got to balance not only volume but  
profitability,'' Adelman said. ``The fact is this industry is more 
profitable when it has moderate price increases.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ann Gurkin, an analyst at Davenport &AMP; Co., said she did not  
expect further price increases this year. But increases in future 
years are likely, Adelman said. 
</P>
<P>
	The industry's obligations under the settlement will increase  
again in 2001 from 50 cents per pack to 58 cents per pack, before 
decreasing in the following years, Adelman said. A further 5 cent 
increase in the federal excise tax is slated for Jan. 1, 2002, and 
state excise taxes may also rise in the coming years. 
</P>
<P>
	Adelman said cigarette prices have risen 28 percent this year  
and predicted increases of 9 percent next year, 6 percent in 2001, 
and 5 percent in 2002.

	SAN'A, Yemen (AP) -- Abdullah al-Baradouni, Yemen's most famous  
poet, who was blinded as a child and later imprisoned several times 
for his politically charged writings, died Monday of a heart 
attack. He was 70. 
</P>
<P>
	Al-Baradouni started out as a teacher of Arabic literature and  
political history. He was blinded at the age of six after 
contracting small pox. 
</P>
<P>
	He served time behind bars in the 1950s, '60s and '70s for poems  
that criticized rulers during that period, including religious 
leaders and the military revolutionaries who overthrew them in 
1962.

``Madame Moscow'' as a force in America's communist movement, died 
Friday. She was 97. 
</P>
<P>
	She taught school in Arkansas before moving to New York,

<HEADLINE> Co. Must Disclose Pension Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- A company that is seriously considering  
improvements in its retirement plan must volunteer that information 
to employees who are considering retirement, a federal appeals 
court ruled Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	In a pair of 2-1 decisions, the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of  
Appeals said an employer's duty to keep employees informed of their 
retirement options includes not only answering questions truthfully 
but also disclosing information without being asked. 
</P>
<P>
	The court reinstated suits by an Exxon employee and six Pacific  
Bell employees who said they would have delayed retirement if 
they'd been told the company was considering a sweetened retirement 
package. Their suits seek participation in the deals that were 
offered later. 
</P>
<P>
	Since 1996, several appellate courts have ruled that companies,  
if asked, must disclose retirement improvements they were 
``seriously considering,'' a term that covers discussion by senior 
management with authority to implement the change. No previous 
appellate court had required a company to volunteer the 
information. 
</P>
<P>
	That's an important step, because ``if you don't know what's  
going on, how do you know to ask a question?'' said Thomas 
Moukawsher, lawyer for the former Exxon employee. He said his 
client, who worked on an oil drilling rig off the Southern 
California coast, was ``completely reliant on the chain of 
communications that the company had.'' 
</P>
<P>
	James Severson, lawyer for Exxon Co. U.S.A., said the ruling  
would create ``fertile ground for lawyers and litigants'' and 
confusion for employers. 
</P>
<P>
	Ernest Bins planned to retire from Exxon on Jan. 1, 1996 and  
heard rumors the company was planning to add a cash payment to its 
normal pension. He delayed his retirement date for a month and 
questioned several supervisors through late December but was told 
they knew nothing. 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, Exxon U.S.A. had been studying the benefit increase as  
an incentive to early retirement for several months, the court 
said. The company president reviewed the proposal in mid-December, 
top executives of the parent Exxon Corp. reviewed and approved it 
in January, and it was formally announced less than two weeks after 
Bins retired. 
</P>
<P>
	The benefit would have been worth an additional $35,000 or  
$40,000 to Bins, his lawyer said. His suit was dismissed by U.S. 
District Judge Harry Hupp of Los Angeles, who said the company had 
no duty to disclose its plans after Bins stopped asking. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pacific Bell suit was filed by six employees who took early  
retirement in June 1995 after being told by managers that the 
company was in bad shape, planned layoffs and did not intend to 
make a better offer. 
</P>
<P>
	The company actually had a healthy pension plan and was planning  
to offer an improved retirement plan to its union, the court said. 
The plan, adopted in August 1995, would have been worth between 
$27,000 and $99,000 to each of the six plaintiffs. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge William Enright of Los Angeles dismissed  
their suit, ruling that the company had not lied to them and that 
disclosure would have interfered with union negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
	The appeals court reinstated both suits, saying the companies  
were seriously considering the improvements before the employees 
retired and should have disclosed their plans, without making any 
guarantees. 
</P>
<P>
	A pension plan, which has the duty to protect its members'  
interests, must notify them of potential changes, rather than 
``penalizing a person who fails to ask the right questions at the 
right time,'' said Judge William Fletcher in the Exxon case. 
</P>
<P>
	The cases are Bins vs. Exxon, 98-55662, and Wayne vs. Pacific  
Bell, 97-56456.

<HEADLINE> Market Said Needs Dose of Disbelief / Commentary  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
                        *AP Business Analyst    	
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Perhaps it is true, as many Internet investors  
insist, that a new world of vast economic resources and riches lies 
ahead for those daring to believe. 
</P>
<P>
	Even Alan Greenspan, his ideology sown in what some think is the  
old world, has hinted that technological breakthroughs make him 
wonder if he can rely anymore on his old economic maps. 
</P>
<P>
	The technology of the information age, the new worlders assert,  
has made business more productive, creating value out of ideas 
rather than of iron, coal and brawn and vastly enhancing human 
wealth. 
</P>
<P>
	Millions of people -- inventors, entrepreneurs, investors,  
speculators, employees among them -- already have benefitted from 
their faith. And now, they say, the benefits will flow to all. 
</P>
<P>
	Ordinary people will be in constant communications via vest  
pocket electronic gadgets. Assembly lines will be run by electronic 
chips, freeing workers for more elevated, brainpower jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	Business costs will be cut at every stage in production, meaning  
more revenue will fall directly to the bottom line. The economic 
pie will grow larger, enabling everyone to have a bigger slice. 
</P>
<P>
	And the threat of inflation, which has hung as heavily over  
progress as the plague in ancient days, will be greatly reduced. 
</P>
<P>
	If this sounds like Utopia, it may be. But, say the daring, the  
wealth of Utopia is already pouring in upon innovators and risk 
takers. Sometimes even in billion dollar amounts. 
</P>
<P>
	A billion dollars is a figure no human being can easily fathom  
in its full dimensions. It can't be spent. It is difficult even to 
give it away. Or, if someone were so disposed, to throw it away. 
</P>
<P>
	But it has been amassed, and quickly, by innovators selling  
shares in their companies. And thousands of lesser fortunes have 
been made by investors and employees who believed in them. 
</P>
<P>
	It's enough to make anyone wonder if there isn't something to  
the new world thesis. And to wonder also, as Greenspan has, if 
there isn't also reason to be fearful and cautious of lottery 
fever. 
</P>
<P>
	Millions of investors already have expressed their belief in the  
new world by buying up shares in new world companies. Their 
pensions are so invested. Their savings. And their borrowings. 
</P>
<P>
	Is this inflation? Not as we used to think of it. It isn't the  
same as pushing up prices of items in the Consumer Price Index. But 
it is creating a wealth effect, which theoretically allows people 
to overspend and undersave. 
</P>
<P>
	And the consequences are different too: Stock prices can deflate  
as well as inflate (as may product prices), and the deflation can 
be catastrophic, affecting jobs, pensions, wages, profits, home 
equity values and ownership ... 
</P>
<P>
	And so, Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, is now more  
than ever inclined to examine stock prices as well as consumer and 
producer prices. And perhaps to discourage heavy investing by 
raising interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
	``We no longer have the luxury to look primarily to the flow of  
goods and services, as conventionally estimated,'' the chairman 
said in a speech late last week. 
</P>
<P>
	Now and in the future, he explained, the Fed must increasingly  
focus on changes in asset values in determining whether inflation 
is becoming a danger to the economy.

<HEADLINE> Ag Experts Seek Tobacco Substitute / Farm Scene  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LEXINGTON, Ky. (AP) -- You say tobacco, Brent Rowell says tomato.  
</P>
<P>
	Rowell is a University of Kentucky vegetable specialist studying  
ways to make the Kentucky-grown tomato a viable alternative to 
tobacco. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think after this year we will have one that will work,''  
Rowell said. 
</P>
<P>
	His work is part of efforts by family-farm advocates, including  
the Kentucky Department of Agriculture, Community Farm Alliance and 
Commodity Growers Cooperative, to help the state's 62,000 small 
farmers retool if they can't live off the state's No. 1 cash crop 
anymore. 
</P>
<P>
	Agriculture leaders want to use half of Kentucky's $3.45 billion  
first-phase tobacco settlement money to hire field staff and 
conduct field trials into alternatives. 
</P>
<P>
	``Lots of tobacco farmers are on the outside looking in and  
wanting to test the water,'' Rowell said. ``But when you're 
starting with a whole new technology, and in this case a real 
cultural change, you've got to have lots of hands-on help.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But it could be a tough sell for a state outpaced by vegetables  
grown in other tobacco states. Vegetables are a $40 million crop in 
Kentucky. Fellow tobacco state North Carolina already sells 10 
times that amount, according to the USDA. 
</P>
<P>
	``You still can't get any crop insurance because the quantities  
of vegetables grown in Kentucky are too small to attract an 
insurer,'' said Georgetown grower Ann Bell. Without insurance, 
bankers won't lend money for horticulture ventures and start-ups. 
</P>
<P>
	Overall, $900,000 in state and federal matching money has gone  
into cooperative marketing efforts in the last two years trying to 
promote that market. 
</P>
<P>
	State agriculture officials have lobbied grocers like Kroger to  
get more Kentucky produce on the shelves, with labels that stand 
out. And the agency has granted $2.2 million to value-added farm 
products like horticulture last year. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	SALEM, Ore. (AP) -- Oregon's hazelnut growers should have a  
healthy harvest this year, producing crops that could be among the 
most plentiful in state history, according to projections. 
</P>
<P>
	The current crop should reach 37,700 tons, according to a  
forecast by the Oregon Agricultural Statistics Service. That's up 
from 15,565 tons produced in 1998, but down from the record 47,000 
tons in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	About 300 tons are expected to be harvested in Washington.  
</P>
<P>
	Hazelnut trees have large harvests every other year, but the  
last couple of years represent somewhat larger swings than normal, 
growers said. 
</P>
<P>
	What prices the bumper crop will bear is another matter. Last  
year, the crop brought 50 cents a pound, well above the 32 cents a 
pound that growers say they need to break even. 
</P>
<P>
	Now that the crop forecast has been released, price negotiations  
can begin, said Michael Klein, manager of the Hazelnut Growers 
Bargaining Association. 
</P>
<P>
	``The forecast is good,'' Klein said. ``It's not so big that the  
industry would have a glut, but it represents above-average yields. 
Last year's price was good, but there was too little crop to make 
money.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even with a good crop forecast, growers have several concerns.  
One big worry this year has been the harvest date. Like many crops 
in Oregon, hazelnuts are expected to be about two weeks late, and 
that could mean a more costly harvest. 
</P>
<P>
	``It could be a wet harvest, and there's less profit when you're  
harvesting in the mud,'' said Gary Pierce, who operates a small 
hazelnut farm in Gervais.

<HEADLINE>  Dennis Dumps Rain on Carolina Coast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTIC BEACH, N.C. (AP) -- Hurricane Dennis turned toward the  
open ocean today while still punishing North Carolina's coastline 
and its fragile barrier islands with drenching rain and high wind 
that knocked out power to thousands of customers. 
</P>
<P>
	By early afternoon, the storm had turned onto an  
east-northeasterly track and was moving at 18 mph. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's a good sign. I'd rather have it going that way than the  
other,'' said Bill Frederick of the National Hurricane Center in 
Miami. 
</P>
<P>
	Frederick said that after accelerating as it heads out to sea,  
Dennis is expected to stall sometime Tuesday, a couple of hundred 
miles from the coast. At that time, it will continue to produce 
high seas and swells, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Meteorologists cautioned that the hurricane's strong wind still  
could cause more problems for coastal residents. 
</P>
<P>
	``(Dennis) has a very large eye, and the highest winds are well  
removed from the center,'' said Todd Kimberlain, another 
meteorologist with the hurricane center. 
</P>
<P>
	Hurricane-force wind, of at least 74 mph, extended as much as 80  
miles out from the center, and tropical storm-force reached up to 
290 miles outward in places, the National Weather Service said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hurricane warnings were canceled this morning for the  
southernmost section of the North Carolina coast, a 66-mile stretch 
from Sunset Beach to Surf City, the weather service said. Near 
Wilmington, the bridge to Wrightsville Beach was reopened and 
residents were allowed to return home. 
</P>
<P>
	A hurricane warning remained in effect for the rest of the North  
Carolina coast, including the Outer Banks islands, and a smattering 
of residents sought refuge in shelters in several coastal counties. 
Evacuation orders had been posted for some of the Outer Banks and 
the bridge linking Bogue Banks island with the mainland was closed 
today because of the rain and wind. 
</P>
<P>
	Waves crested Hatteras Island's dunes and washed onto N.C.  
Highway 12, threatening to cut the 60-mile-long barrier island's 
only link to Nags Head to the north. Sand blowing across the 
highway reduced visibility to just yards at times. 
</P>
<P>
	On the mainland, a head-on traffic accident blamed on the high  
wind and heavy rainfall killed two people today at the town of 
Richlands, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	At 1 p.m. EDT, Dennis was centered 95 miles east-southeast of  
Cape Lookout, and was moving toward the east-northeast at about 18 
mph, up from a forward motion of 15 mph an hour earlier. Its 
maximum sustained wind was down from 100 mph at noon to about 95 
mph. 
</P>
<P>
	Gusts to 112 mph were reported early today at Frying Pan Shoals,  
about 25 miles off the coast south of Wilmington, the weather 
service said. 
</P>
<P>
	A tropical storm warning was in effect northward to the Maryland  
state line and a gale warning extended to Cape Henlopen, Del. 
</P>
<P>
	Rain fell at a rate of almost 3 inches an hour along the North  
Carolina coast and the weather service said 10 inches of rain was 
possible in some areas. Southport, south of Wilmington, got 8 
inches of rain. There was also a chance of isolated tornadoes. 
</P>
<P>
	At daybreak, some low-lying streets on Atlantic Beach and  
parking lots on the mainland at Morehead City flooded, but no 
streets appeared to be impassable. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 50,000 customers were without power today from New  
Hanover County to as far west as Raleigh in the central part of the 
state, utilities reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Roughly 100 evacuees -- fewer than expected -- sought refuge  
Sunday night at a Red Cross shelter at a Wilmington school. ``It's 
just been a trickle,'' said shelter manager Judy Saunders. 
</P>
<P>
	On Sunday afternoon, Gov. Jim Hunt issued emergency and disaster  
decrees, allowing more resources to be devoted to the storm. 
Seymour Johnson Air Force Base sent aircraft to bases in Ohio as a 
precaution. 
</P>
<P>
	Vice President Al Gore and his family cut short their 12-day  
beach vacation on Figure Eight Island, said Tommy Taft, a 
Greenville attorney and family friend. 
</P>
<P>
	But in Atlantic Beach on Sunday, residents took the storm in  
stride. Few houses were boarded up, including those directly on the 
coast. Fire officials combed the beachfront, chasing away those who 
ignored posted warnings. 
</P>
<P>
	Just offshore, lone surfer Joey Gray rose and fell on surging  
swells. ``I think he's nuts,'' said fire department Lt. Phil 
Lawrence as he waited for Gray to come ashore. 
</P>
<P>
	Once on land, Gray was unfazed. ``I know it has a certain amount  
of risk,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	In South Carolina, Dennis had become more a nuisance than a  
threat as tourists left the coast in bumper-to-bumper traffic, but 
the rain also brought a measure of relief in a season of drought. 
Gov. Jim Hodges ordered the National Guard sent home today.

<HEADLINE> Clintons Visit New York State Fair </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SYRACUSE, N.Y. (AP) -- President Clinton tapped the toe of his  
cowboy boot and looked a little out of sorts as the speakers at a 
New York political gathering took turns praising his wife and 
cheering on her presumed run for the Senate from their state. 
</P>
<P>
	Although he speaks warmly of her credentials and seems intrigued  
by the novelty of fostering a second politician in the family, the 
president is still new at the business of being a political spouse. 
</P>
<P>
	``You know, it's pretty nice to go to a lunch like this when  
you're the only one who's not running for anything,'' Clinton joked 
at the beginning of his speech to farmers and politicos Monday at 
the New York State Fair. 
</P>
<P>
	In her speech, Hillary Rodham Clinton noted that ``there is not  
any place better'' to gauge public sentiment than a state fair. 
</P>
<P>
	The fair was the first stop for the Clintons in upstate New  
York, where they and their daughter, Chelsea, are ending a 16-day 
family vacation this week. The five-day leg will offer ample time 
for golf (the president) and glad-handing (the potential Senate 
candidate). 
</P>
<P>
	As they made their way from the fairgrounds to their borrowed  
lakeside estate in the well-heeled village of Skaneateles, 
reporters asked the president whether he is offering his wife tips 
on campaigning. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think she's doing pretty well without any help from me,''  
Clinton replied. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton has had plenty of help from her husband. Her  
vacation schedule in the Hamptons, Skaneateles and the rest of New 
York's Finger Lakes region and Martha's Vineyard in Massachusetts 
included several fund-raisers for the Democratic party and Mrs. 
Clinton's senatorial exploratory committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Republicans outnumber Democrats at least two-to-one in  
this part of upstate, the Clintons got an enthusiastic welcome. 
Homemade signs offering greetings lined their motorcade route, and 
red, white and blue bunting cascaded from the fronts of charming 
Victorian houses in the Skaneateles village center. 
</P>
<P>
	En route to the vacation house, the first family stopped at a  
lemonade stand where two young boys waved a sign promising them 
free refreshments. 
</P>
<P>
	Up the road, three dozen people waited by the side of the road  
to greet the Clintons. After winding a little boy's camera to make 
sure he got the shot, the president finished shaking hands and 
stepped back to his bronze Suburban. 
</P>
<P>
	But the motorcade wasn't ready to roll. He waited, with his arms  
folded, his chin resting on his hand, watching his wife as she 
chatted with the young girls who stepped up to greet her and shook 
every last hand in the line. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked if he was proud, the president replied: ``Absolutely.''

<HEADLINE> CDC: Decline in AIDS Deaths Slowing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- The drop-off in AIDS deaths since the  
introduction of powerful drug cocktails has slowed dramatically, 
raising questions about whether the combination of medicines is 
reaching the limits of what it can do. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, researchers were stunned to learn that AIDS deaths  
nationwide dropped 42 percent from 1996 to 1997 -- a drop attributed 
to the potent drug cocktails that can subdue the virus. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, however, statistics released at the first national  
conference on AIDS prevention showed that the decline in deaths 
slowed to 20 percent from 1997 to 1998, when AIDS killed 17,047 
people. 
</P>
<P>
	``As we anticipated, we are now seeing the first signs of a  
slowing in this trend,'' Dr. Helene Gayle, director of HIV 
prevention at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said 
during the National HIV Prevention Conference. 
</P>
<P>
	``In a period of only two years, new combination therapies cut  
the annual level of death in half. But for the time being it 
appears that much of the benefit of these new therapies has been 
realized.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The CDC blamed the slowdown on three factors:  
</P>
<P>
	-- Some people still aren't getting tested and treated for the  
AIDS virus. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Some are finding it difficult to stick the complicated regimen  
of pills, which must be taken at certain times of the day, 
sometimes with food, sometimes without. 
</P>
<P>
	--Drug-resistant strains of the virus are emerging as patients  
fail to keep on schedule with their medicine. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials at the CDC, which released the numbers, said it's  
still too early to tell if the current treatments have pushed AIDS 
deaths as low was they can go. 
</P>
<P>
	But one worrisome sign is that the decline in deaths last year  
occurred mostly in the first three months of 1998. After that, 
deaths leveled off for the rest of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	``We might continue to see that decline,'' Gayle said. ``But it  
is at least a concern that most declines were in the first quarter 
of 1998 and not in the last quarter.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After AIDS killed 49,351 in 1995, deaths dropped 25 percent in  
1996 to 36,792. They then plummeted to 21,222 deaths in 1997, a 
drop of 42 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The numbers caused experts to toast the so-called AIDS cocktails  
that combine older drugs with newer medicines known as protease 
inhibitors. The drug combinations reduce the level of the virus in 
the blood so low that it can't be measured. 
</P>
<P>
	Some advocates pointed to the CDC's latest numbers as proof that  
the drugs aren't as effective as once hoped. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our worst fears have become a tragic reality,'' said Steven  
Fisher of the advocacy group AIDS Action. ``AIDS drugs don't work 
for everyone and aren't a cure for anyone.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The CDC acknowledges that the problems with the pill regimen,  
drug-resistant strains and undiagnosed people make it harder to 
reduce deaths even more. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have gotten the drugs out to the people that know they're  
infected,'' Gayle said. ``I think now we've got to do a better job 
to be sure we get access to treatment for people who don't know 
they're infected, which means getting more people tested.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The CDC estimates there are as many as 900,000 people infected  
with HIV in the United States, with new infections holding steady 
at roughly 40,000 a year for the last decade. 
</P>
<P>
	The latest numbers show that AIDS continues to kill blacks in  
much higher numbers than other racial groups. 
</P>
<P>
	Blacks, who make up about 13 percent of the population,  
accounted for 49 percent of AIDS deaths in 1998. Thirty-two percent 
of deaths were among whites and Hispanics made up 18 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's real disturbing,'' Gayle said. ``We know that often  
times, if a disease becomes higher in populations that are more 
marginalized in our society, we forget about those problems. We 
can't afford to forget about HIV.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The four-day conference, organized by the CDC and 17 other  
agencies, features 2,000 scientists, doctors, researchers and 
advocates addressing efforts to monitor and prevent the spread of 
the AIDS virus.

<HEADLINE>  Raines Sees Former Teammates in NY </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Tim Raines walked into the New York Yankees'  
clubhouse Monday a little lighter than usual and with the heavy 
weight of a chronic disease. 
</P>
<P>
	One by one, Yankees players and coaches walked up to their  
former teammate, who earlier this month revealed he had Lupus. They 
embraced him, expressed their sympathies and joked with him. 
</P>
<P>
	The player most responsible for keeping the Yankees' clubhouse  
loose and the players laughing during a record-setting season in 
1998 needed his spirits lifted. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was emotional. Very emotional,'' Raines said before his  
Oakland Athletics played the New York Yankees. ``This was my first 
time seeing these guys since this happened. It's my first time back 
in New York since the World Series parade. It's been an emotional 
day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There have been a lot of emotional days recently for Raines, who  
has a disease with no known cure. Lupus is a connective tissue 
disease in which the immune system turns against a person's own 
body. It effects various parts of the body, especially the skin, 
joints, blood and kidneys. 
</P>
<P>
	Its symptoms can be treated and Raines is taking medication  
daily and intravenous treatment once a month. While his season is 
over, the 39-year-old Raines vows to return to baseball by spring 
training and still is committed to one day playing with his son, 
Tim Jr., who is in the Baltimore Orioles' farm system. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm going to play again,'' he said. ``I know that. I can play  
five or six more years. I feel like a rookie again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Raines became bloated and mysteriously gained 15 pounds near the  
All-Star break. A kidney biopsy was performed July 23 and he was 
then diagnosed with Lupus. 
</P>
<P>
	Raines underwent four days of treatment in the hospital, where  
he was given high doses of medications designed to relieve the 
swelling in his kidneys and to try keep his immune system from 
attacking his own body. 
</P>
<P>
	He has since lost about 25 pounds and has already begun to taper  
off his medication. Doctors say if the disease is in remission, 
Raines could return to play. 
</P>
<P>
	Raines, one of baseball's top base stealers and leadoff hitters  
during his 20-year career, was told he by doctors he probably had 
Lupus for more than a year. The disease could have contributed to 
knee and hamstring problems when he played with the Yankees from 
1996-98. 
</P>
<P>
	While those injuries slowed him, he still contributed enough to  
help the Yankees win two World Series championships during his 
stay. 
</P>
<P>
	``If there is one person we miss, not necessarily because of his  
at-bats but because of his presence, it's Rock,'' manager Joe 
Torre. ``He had an infectious laugh.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That laugh and presence were visible Monday. There was Raines  
telling Paul O'Neill he could still pick up a bat and swing. He 
chastised Ramiro Mendoza for not throwing enough fastballs. He even 
played a practical joke on Mariano Rivera. 
</P>
<P>
	Rivera walked up behind Raines and gave him a hard pat on the  
back. Raines turned around and shot Rivera a glare. 
</P>
<P>
	``I ain't that healthy anymore. Don't hit me like that,'' he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Rivera stepped back with a worried look on his face. Then came  
that laugh. 
</P>
<P>
	``I got you. I got you,'' Raines squealed.  
</P>
<P>
	Rivera broke into a smile and hugged his former teammate. Once  
again he brought laughter to a serious situation. 
</P>
<P>
	``He helped us win two World Series,'' Tino Martinez said.  
``Just look. You can see how he is.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Raines had two purposes to his trip: to visit his teammates and  
to receive his second World Series ring. During the pregame ring 
ceremony, it was the Yankees turn to play a joke on Raines. 
</P>
<P>
	Raines was called out onto the field and received a standing  
ovation from the crowd, the Athletics and the Yankees. Torre handed 
him an empty box, which Raines held up to the crowd. 
</P>
<P>
	Bernie Williams and the rest of the Yankees then walked out,  
handed Raines his ring and hugged him. Raines returned to the A's 
dugout, showing off the prize. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's what we play for,'' he said. ``When you sign up to be a  
major league player, you don't sing up for a big bonus. You sign up 
because you want to be a World Series champion. It took 17 years to 
get one, but the greatest feeling in the world is to be a World 
Series champion. I've got two and I feel like I can do it again.''

<HEADLINE> Bankers Say Asia Economy Improving </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SINGAPORE (AP) -- There has been a ``marked improvement'' in the  
performance of Asian economies, a group of international finance 
officials said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	But the region still needs to continue with structural reforms  
in order to achieve a lasting recovery from the economic crisis, 
said a statement issued by the Manila framework, a group of finance 
officials set up in 1997 to tackle the Asian crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	Japan has exhibited ``clearer signs'' of recovery in certain  
sectors, the group said. But it warned Japan needs to continue 
fiscal stimulus measures until private demand strengthens further, 
in order for its recovery to take hold. 
</P>
<P>
	The group also agreed that China needs to pursue a more  
proactive fiscal policy through more investment in fixed assets. 
</P>
<P>
	The Manila framework group includes several Asian countries, the  
U.S., Canada, and the International Monetary Fund. 
</P>
<P>
	The group will next meet in Hong Kong in the first half of 2000.

<HEADLINE> Stocks Mostly Down; Dow Off 59.53 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were mostly lower today as investors  
returned to a waiting game, staying out of the market until the 
next round of economic data offers clues to the future course of 
interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
	In midday trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial  
average was down 59.53 at 11,030.64. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators were also lower. The Standard &AMP; Poor's  
500 index was down 8.73 at 1,339.54, and the Nasdaq composite index 
was down 25.73 at 2,733.17. 
</P>
<P>
	This week, reports on manufacturing activity and unemployment  
are expected to offer the latest signs of whether the nation's 
continued economic growth is being threatened by inflation.

	Analysts say signs of inflation could convince investors that  
the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates for a third time this 
year. The Fed raised rates in late June and last Tuesday, and 
stocks rose on chairman Alan Greenspan's hint that the two rate 
increases may be enough to keep inflation at bay. 
</P>
<P>
	But on Friday, the Dow dropped 108 points after Greenspan  
suggested at a Fed conference that the central bank should consider 
the effects of the bull market while setting monetary policy. 
Greenspan also deemed the market's long rise ``inexplicable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``People have good reason to be concerned and cautious,'' said  
William Meehan, chief market analyst at Cantor Fitzgerald. ``If 
anyone had any doubts that Mr. Greenspan is still concerned about 
inflation, he put them to rest on Friday.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts say Greenspan has been distressed by the market's  
tendency to rise following interest rate increases. Generally, 
higher rates are bad for stocks because they can cut into corporate 
profits and make other investment vehicles more attractive. 
</P>
<P>
	Today, Boeing rose 1 13/16 to 45 4/8 after company officials and  
leaders of its largest union neared agreement on a three-year 
contract. If ratified, the contract would eliminate the threat of a 
strike that has hung over the company. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of Progressive Corp. plunged 18 11/16 to 100 5/16 after  
the company said it will miss earnings expectations in the third 
quarter due to price cuts and changes in the auto industry. 
</P>
<P>
	Internet shares, which were mostly higher last week, slipped  
back as investors locked in profits. Amazon.com fell 6 13/16 to 121 
11/16. Bamboo.com, which made its initial public offering of stock 
last Thursday, was down 4 1/4 to 19 1/8. 
</P>
<P>
	Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 2-to-1 margin on the  
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 244.17 million 
shares, behind Friday's pace. Friday was the quietest session of 
1999. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russell 2000 index was down 3.27 at 429.18.

<HEADLINE> Indians' Alomar Wants Surgery Later </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- Cleveland Indians catcher Sandy Alomar needs  
another knee operation but wants to try to postpone it until after 
the season. 
</P>
<P>
	``I will do anything it takes to go play baseball,'' said  
Alomar, who had surgery May 21, 10 days days after he went on the 
disabled list, to remove a bone chip from his left knee. 
</P>
<P>
	With five weeks left in the regular season, Alomar said Monday  
he will get an injection of gel in the back of the knee in an 
effort to relieve discomfort, then resume his rehabilitation 
program while wearing a brace. 
</P>
<P>
	``They said I should notice improvement in five-to-seven days,''  
the six-time All-Star said. ``If not, well, then the surgery is 
inevitable. I know that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Alomar, who at one point said he has lost track of how many  
times he has had knee surgery (eight), explained that if he played 
any other position, ``I would have been back playing two months 
ago.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't have any problem when I'm catching and not really when  
I'm hitting or running, but on a throw I experience discomfort in 
my knee that sends spasms to my leg. Then I don't really have a lot 
of strength in my leg for a few innings. Can I play nine innings? 
Yes. Am I going to be reliable for nine innings? Hey, I don't 
know.'' 
</P>
<P>
	General Manager John Hart said he is exploring trade options.  
</P>
<P>
	``Sandy is our No. 1 catcher,'' Hart said. ``Einar Diaz has done  
a good job for us, too, but we must recognize the fact that Sandy 
might not be able to play. When healthy, Sandy is one of the best 
in the game. Right now, we don't know if he can go, however.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Alomar is hitting .317 with three homers and 16 RBIs in 82  
at-bats this year. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't want to call it quits for this season,'' he said. ``I  
can play with pain. I have played with pain. Please don't question 
that. But I want to be the best I can. If I can't help the team 
then it is not fair to anybody -- my teammates, the manager and the 
fans.''

<HEADLINE> Firefighter Dies in Calif. Blaze </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Firefighters battling flames on thousands of acres of Western  
brushland on Sunday had a grim reminder of the danger after a 
California firefighter died fighting a blaze north of Santa 
Barbara. 
</P>
<P>
	Rescuers found Stephen Joseph Masto, 28, in steep terrain of the  
Los Padres National Forest on Saturday after he didn't return to 
camp. Officials said it wasn't clear how he died and there was no 
evidence of burns. 
</P>
<P>
	``This may have been his first wildfire,'' said Michael  
Kotowski, a battalion chief with the Santa Barbara, Calif., city 
fire department were Masto was stationed. He said Masto had 
volunteered to help fight the 180-acre blaze. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite strong, shifting winds Sunday, fire officials across the  
West expressed cautious hope of controlling fires that have been 
raging for the last week in several states. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 200,000 acres have burned.  
</P>
<P>
	``The best news is that we're very slowly getting containment  
around most of the fires,'' said Alleah Haley, a fire information 
officer for the California Department of Forestry in Butte County. 
</P>
<P>
	``The bad news is that we're expecting 20-30 mph winds. We're  
holding all our resources, hoping for the best and being prepared 
for the worst,'' Haley said. 
</P>
<P>
	Blazes in the Northern California county charred 32,914 acres.  
Two major fires were surrounded, and firefighters were gaining the 
upperhand on three others. 
</P>
<P>
	In the mountains northeast of Los Angeles, high, erratic winds  
caused the evacuation of two sparsely populated desert communities 
north of a 16,640-acre fire burning near the resort town of Lake 
Arrowhead, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	A fire in the Stanislaus National Forest that forced the closure  
of Highway 120 into Yosemite National Park was contained after 
burning 4,028 acres, but officials kept about 1,000 firefighters on 
the scene for fear of flareups. The highway was reopened Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Several small fires in Southern California closed some mountain  
highways but caused little damage and no injuries, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	In Nevada, crews had contained the largest fire, 45,000 acres  
north of Reno, but a blaze 80 miles southwest of Ely had burned 
10,000 acres and was still raging. And in Washington State, smaller 
fires near the Columbia River and Major Creek were under control 
Sunday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	Light rain in Oregon lessened the threat of several small  
lightning-sparked fires. A 1,500-acre grass fire on the Warm 
Springs Indian Reservation in north-central Oregon was contained, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Even with the dangers they face, firefighters from Masto's Santa  
Barbara department line up to help fight the big wildfires, 
Kotowski said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everyone loves to go. It's a great assignment, very  
exciting,'' he said. ``In fact, it's such a popular assignment that 
we have a formal rotation. Steve was next up. You can decline to 
go, but he certainly didn't. He wanted to go.''

<HEADLINE>  Dennis Dumps Rain on Carolina Coast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTIC BEACH, N.C. (AP) -- Hurricane Dennis turned toward the  
open ocean today while still punishing North Carolina's coastline 
and its fragile barrier islands with drenching rain and high wind 
that knocked out power to thousands of customers. 
</P>
<P>
	By early afternoon, the storm had turned onto an  
east-northeasterly track and was moving at 18 mph. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's a good sign. I'd rather have it going that way than the  
other,'' said Bill Frederick of the National Hurricane Center in 
Miami. 
</P>
<P>
	Frederick said that after accelerating as it heads out to sea,  
Dennis is expected to stall sometime Tuesday, a couple of hundred 
miles from the coast. At that time, it will continue to produce 
high seas and swells, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Meteorologists cautioned that the hurricane's strong wind still  
could cause more problems for coastal residents. 
</P>
<P>
	``(Dennis) has a very large eye, and the highest winds are well  
removed from the center,'' said Todd Kimberlain, another 
meteorologist with the hurricane center. 
</P>
<P>
	Hurricane-force wind, of at least 74 mph, extended as much as 80  
miles out from the center, and tropical storm-force reached up to 
290 miles outward in places, the National Weather Service said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hurricane warnings were canceled this morning for the  
southernmost section of the North Carolina coast, a 66-mile stretch 
from Sunset Beach to Surf City, the weather service said. Near 
Wilmington, the bridge to Wrightsville Beach was reopened and 
residents were allowed to return home. 
</P>
<P>
	A hurricane warning remained in effect for the rest of the North  
Carolina coast, including the Outer Banks islands, and a smattering 
of residents sought refuge in shelters in several coastal counties. 
Evacuation orders had been posted for some of the Outer Banks and 
the bridge linking Bogue Banks island with the mainland was closed 
today because of the rain and wind. 
</P>
<P>
	Waves crested Hatteras Island's dunes and washed onto N.C.  
Highway 12, threatening to cut the 60-mile-long barrier island's 
only link to Nags Head to the north. Sand blowing across the 
highway reduced visibility to just yards at times. 
</P>
<P>
	On the mainland, a head-on traffic accident blamed on the high  
wind and heavy rainfall killed two people today at the town of 
Richlands, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	At 1 p.m. EDT, Dennis was centered 95 miles east-southeast of  
Cape Lookout, and was moving toward the east-northeast at about 18 
mph, up from a forward motion of 15 mph an hour earlier. Its 
maximum sustained wind was down from 100 mph at noon to about 95 
mph. 
</P>
<P>
	Gusts to 112 mph were reported early today at Frying Pan Shoals,  
about 25 miles off the coast south of Wilmington, the weather 
service said. 
</P>
<P>
	A tropical storm warning was in effect northward to the Maryland  
state line and a gale warning extended to Cape Henlopen, Del. 
</P>
<P>
	Rain fell at a rate of almost 3 inches an hour along the North  
Carolina coast and the weather service said 10 inches of rain was 
possible in some areas. Southport, south of Wilmington, got 8 
inches of rain. There was also a chance of isolated tornadoes. 
</P>
<P>
	At daybreak, some low-lying streets on Atlantic Beach and  
parking lots on the mainland at Morehead City flooded, but no 
streets appeared to be impassable. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 50,000 customers were without power today from New  
Hanover County to as far west as Raleigh in the central part of the 
state, utilities reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Roughly 100 evacuees -- fewer than expected -- sought refuge  
Sunday night at a Red Cross shelter at a Wilmington school. ``It's 
just been a trickle,'' said shelter manager Judy Saunders. 
</P>
<P>
	On Sunday afternoon, Gov. Jim Hunt issued emergency and disaster  
decrees, allowing more resources to be devoted to the storm. 
Seymour Johnson Air Force Base sent aircraft to bases in Ohio as a 
precaution. 
</P>
<P>
	Vice President Al Gore and his family cut short their 12-day  
beach vacation on Figure Eight Island, said Tommy Taft, a 
Greenville attorney and family friend. 
</P>
<P>
	But in Atlantic Beach on Sunday, residents took the storm in  
stride. Few houses were boarded up, including those directly on the 
coast. Fire officials combed the beachfront, chasing away those who 
ignored posted warnings. 
</P>
<P>
	Just offshore, lone surfer Joey Gray rose and fell on surging  
swells. ``I think he's nuts,'' said fire department Lt. Phil 
Lawrence as he waited for Gray to come ashore. 
</P>
<P>
	Once on land, Gray was unfazed. ``I know it has a certain amount  
of risk,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	In South Carolina, Dennis had become more a nuisance than a  
threat as tourists left the coast in bumper-to-bumper traffic, but 
the rain also brought a measure of relief in a season of drought. 
Gov. Jim Hodges ordered the National Guard sent home today.

<HEADLINE> Jack Ford Leaving NBC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Jack Ford is leaving NBC to be a host and  
correspondent on ABC's ``20/20,'' where he will be a leading 
candidate to replace Charles Gibson on ``Good Morning America.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ford has been the chief legal correspondent at NBC and co-anchor  
of the ``Today'' show weekend editions. 
</P>
<P>
	He will report legal and other stories and anchor one night a  
week for ``20/20,'' a newsmagazine. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford will also sub regularly on ``GMA,'' where Gibson returned  
as host in January to stop a ratings free fall. Gibson said he will 
stay with the morning show through the spring. 
</P>
<P>
	Both Ford and ABC News spokeswoman Eileen Murphy said no  
promises had been made that Ford will inherit Gibson's job. But 
Ford said Monday it's an attractive position. 
</P>
<P>
	A former prosecutor in Monmouth County, N.J., Ford began his TV  
career as a legal commentator at New York's WCBS in 1983. He was an 
anchor at Court TV from 1991 until 1994.

<HEADLINE> Redskins Cut Joe Patton </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ASHBURN, Va. (AP) -- Joe Patton was his typical blunt self as he  
carried the big box with his belongings out the front door of 
Redskin Park on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	He was a victim of double jeopardy, having fallen into disfavor  
with both the coach and the owner, and it just didn't make sense to 
him at all. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know this is a business move,'' Patton said. ``If you ask my  
opinion, it was a dumb business move.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Patton, the team's most versatile offensive lineman the last  
four years, and kicker Cary Blanchard were among 14 players cut 
Monday as the Washington Redskins trimmed their roster to 70 
players. Blanchard's release means Brett Conway has won the 
kicker's job. 
</P>
<P>
	On paper alone, Patton's release would be a mystery. He has  
started 54 games the last four years, including 37 at left tackle, 
the position responsible for protecting the quarterback's blind 
side. Five of his left tackle starts came in the second half of 
last season, when the Redskins finished strong. 
</P>
<P>
	The other left tackles on the roster are Andy Heck, an 11th-year  
veteran who's had back trouble and is the weakest starter on 
offense, and fifth-year player Kipp Vickers, who clearly was unable 
to match Patton during training camp. Shar Pourdanesh, who was 
splitting first-team work with Patton when camp began, was traded 
earlier this month after he became upset over his demotion to 
second team. 
</P>
<P>
	So why cut Patton? Coach Norv Turner, while conceding that  
Patton might be a better lineman than some he is keeping, cited 
``commitment,'' ``energy'' and ``attitude'' -- all of them lacking 
from a player who signed a five-year, $12.5 million contract in 
1998. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you make that kind of commitment to a player, the player  
has to make that same kind of commitment to you, and it's got to be 
an every-day deal,'' Turner said. ``Those are a number of the 
conversations Joe and I have had over the last couple of years, 
about responsibility involved when you get to this level. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think he understands where I'm coming from. It doesn't mean  
he agrees.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Patton has always been outspoken and opinionated, traits that  
usually don't sit well with Turner, and his offseason workouts 
haven't been the best. 
</P>
<P>
	``I saw it coming way before you guys started talking about  
it,'' Patton said. ``I saw it coming because they had lack of 
confidence and lack of trust in me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Patton lost the starting job when he made a mental lapse on a  
blocking assignment in the exhibition opener against New England, 
allowing quarterback Brad Johnson to take a hard sack. The 
following week, new owner Dan Snyder referred to that play when 
asked which player was his least favorite Redskin. 
</P>
<P>
	Turner said Patton's release wasn't directly a result of that  
one play, and Patton seemed to agree. 
</P>
<P>
	``Snyder doesn't know everything he needs to know about this  
team yet,'' Patton said. ``And to go out and make a judgment about 
one player ... I'm not calling Mr. Snyder dumb, but that comment -- 
he didn't know me and had never met me. You have to look over stuff 
like that and go on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For Patton's best friend, Tre Johnson, there's the obvious  
concern: What happens if Heck's back gives out? How will Patton's 
release look then? 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's going to hurt us,'' Johnson said. ``He made the  
mistake in the New England game, and allowed them to capitalize on 
it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Also cut were receiver Kevin Alexander, running back Leroy  
Collins, punter Travis Colquitt, cornerback Buddy Crutchfield, 
linebacker Matt Finkes, receiver Junior Lord, receiver Kenny 
Mitchell, quarterback John Paci, safety Kevin Peoples, tackle Ozell 
Powell, defensive tackle Rod Walker and fourth-round draft pick 
Nate Stimson, who struggled to convert from defensive end to 
linebacker. 
</P>
<P>
	Fifth-round draft pick Derek Smith, a tackle who injured his  
knee at the NFL combine, was placed on injured reserve.

<HEADLINE>  East Timorese Vote on Independence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DILI, Indonesia (AP) -- Throngs of East Timorese defied threats  
of violence to cast their ballots today in a U.N.-supervised 
referendum on independence after decades of Indonesian rule. 
</P>
<P>
	U.N. officials hailed the huge, peaceful turnout. They estimated  
that 90 percent of registered voters cast ballots. 
</P>
<P>
	``The eagle of liberty has spread its wings over the people of  
East Timor,'' U.N. envoy Jamsheed Marker said in the provincial 
capital of Dili. He refused to speculate on the outcome, but said 
the voting was free and fair. The United Nations says it will need 
seven days to count and verify votes. 
</P>
<P>
	Optimistic independence supporters predicted that the enormous  
turnout meant success for their cause, allowing East Timor to break 
completely with Indonesia. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are convinced that we have won because our people have  
suffered under Indonesia,'' said Leandro Isaac, a prominent 
independence leader. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite fears that many people would be too scared to vote, long  
lines formed outside polling centers. In many towns, enthusiastic 
voters scuffled to be the first to cast their ballots. 
</P>
<P>
	Guerrillas who have fought Indonesian troops for more than two  
decades walked out of the jungles carrying voter registration cards 
rather than guns. 
</P>
<P>
	But in Liquica, about 15 miles west of Dili, frightened  
villagers accused militiamen of threatening to burn their homes if 
they voted to break away from Indonesia, which invaded in 1975. 
</P>
<P>
	Heavily armed police who failed to rein in attacks by  
anti-independence militias stood guard, along with unarmed U.N. 
police advisers. 
</P>
<P>
	Indonesia invaded East Timor nearly a quarter-century ago, after  
Portugal ended a reign of nearly 400 years. Human rights groups 
claim 200,000 people have died in the ensuing violence. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 451,000 voters, including 13,000 East Timorese living  
abroad, registered for the ballot. They were asked if their 
impoverished, mainly Roman Catholic homeland should stay part of 
Muslim-dominated Indonesia as an autonomous region or break away 
completely. 
</P>
<P>
	Anti-independence militiamen, accused of killing and terrorizing  
civilians to slash support for independence, said they would abide 
by the result that is to be announced by Sept. 7. 
</P>
<P>
	Dozens of people have been killed this year. An estimated 60,000  
have fled their homes in fear. Many traveled back to their 
shattered villages to cast votes. 
</P>
<P>
	There is overwhelming evidence that the military has backed the  
pro-Jakarta militias, though the government has consistently denied 
it. The armed forces have been reluctant to give up their hold on 
East Timor after nearly a quarter-century of a strong presence 
there. 
</P>
<P>
	The polls closed at 4 p.m., giving residents time to hurry home  
before nightfall and a possible new round of militia attacks. 
</P>
<P>
	In the town of Emera, 40 miles south of Dili, provocateurs fired  
gunshots before being dispersed by police. 
</P>
<P>
	A U.N. officer was injured in a shooting incident while helping  
monitor the referendum, Japanese Vice Foreign Minister Yutaka 
Kawashima said in Tokyo today. He provided no details. 
</P>
<P>
	In Jakarta, Indonesian Defense Minister and armed forces chief  
Wiranto said the military has the impression that the U.N. team 
carried out its duties very well. 
</P>
<P>
	``We consistently appeal to both sides to lay down their arms  
and surrender them to the Indonesian police,'' Wiranto said. He, 
like many Indonesians, uses only one name. 
</P>
<P>
	Sensing the overwhelming support for independence, a soft-spoken  
President B.J. Habibie went on national television Sunday night to 
appeal to East Timor's voters to remain a part of this sprawling 
nation of 210 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Separatist leader Jose Alexandre ``Xanana'' Gusmao called for a  
big turnout, then received a hero's welcome when he voted at the 
U.N. polling station in the Indonesian capital of Jakarta, where he 
is under house arrest. 
</P>
<P>
	A large crowd clapped and cheered when Timor's spiritual leader  
and 1996 Nobel Peace Prize winner, Bishop Carlos Belo, voted at a 
Dili schoolhouse. 
</P>
<P>
	In Sydney, Jose Ramos Horta, who shared the Nobel prize with  
Belo, joined several hundred East Timorese refugees now living in 
Australia and New Zealand in casting his vote. 
</P>

<HEADLINE>  East Timorese Vote on Independence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DILI, Indonesia (AP) -- Throngs of East Timorese defied threats  
of violence to cast their ballots today in a U.N.-supervised 
referendum on independence after decades of Indonesian rule. 
</P>
<P>
	U.N. officials hailed the huge, peaceful turnout. They estimated  
that 90 percent of registered voters cast ballots. 
</P>
<P>
	``The eagle of liberty has spread its wings over the people of  
East Timor,'' U.N. envoy Jamsheed Marker said in the provincial 
capital of Dili. He refused to speculate on the outcome, but said 
the voting was free and fair. The United Nations says it will need 
seven days to count and verify votes. 
</P>
<P>
	Optimistic independence supporters predicted that the enormous  
turnout meant success for their cause, allowing East Timor to break 
completely with Indonesia. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are convinced that we have won because our people have  
suffered under Indonesia,'' said Leandro Isaac, a prominent 
independence leader. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite fears that many people would be too scared to vote, long  
lines formed outside polling centers. In many towns, enthusiastic 
voters scuffled to be the first to cast their ballots. 
</P>
<P>
	Guerrillas who have fought Indonesian troops for more than two  
decades walked out of the jungles carrying voter registration cards 
rather than guns. 
</P>
<P>
	But in Liquica, about 15 miles west of Dili, frightened  
villagers accused militiamen of threatening to burn their homes if 
they voted to break away from Indonesia, which invaded in 1975. 
</P>
<P>
	Heavily armed police who failed to rein in attacks by  
anti-independence militias stood guard, along with unarmed U.N. 
police advisers. 
</P>
<P>
	Indonesia invaded East Timor nearly a quarter-century ago, after  
Portugal ended a reign of nearly 400 years. Human rights groups 
claim 200,000 people have died in the ensuing violence. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 451,000 voters, including 13,000 East Timorese living  
abroad, registered for the ballot. They were asked if their 
impoverished, mainly Roman Catholic homeland should stay part of 
Muslim-dominated Indonesia as an autonomous region or break away 
completely. 
</P>
<P>
	Anti-independence militiamen, accused of killing and terrorizing  
civilians to slash support for independence, said they would abide 
by the result that is to be announced by Sept. 7. 
</P>
<P>
	Dozens of people have been killed this year. An estimated 60,000  
have fled their homes in fear. Many traveled back to their 
shattered villages to cast votes. 
</P>
<P>
	There is overwhelming evidence that the military has backed the  
pro-Jakarta militias, though the government has consistently denied 
it. The armed forces have been reluctant to give up their hold on 
East Timor after nearly a quarter-century of a strong presence 
there. 
</P>
<P>
	The polls closed at 4 p.m., giving residents time to hurry home  
before nightfall and a possible new round of militia attacks. 
</P>
<P>
	In the town of Emera, 40 miles south of Dili, provocateurs fired  
gunshots before being dispersed by police. 
</P>
<P>
	A U.N. officer was injured in a shooting incident while helping  
monitor the referendum, Japanese Vice Foreign Minister Yutaka 
Kawashima said in Tokyo today. He provided no details. 
</P>
<P>
	In Jakarta, Indonesian Defense Minister and armed forces chief  
Wiranto said the military has the impression that the U.N. team 
carried out its duties very well. 
</P>
<P>
	``We consistently appeal to both sides to lay down their arms  
and surrender them to the Indonesian police,'' Wiranto said. He, 
like many Indonesians, uses only one name. 
</P>
<P>
	Sensing the overwhelming support for independence, a soft-spoken  
President B.J. Habibie went on national television Sunday night to 
appeal to East Timor's voters to remain a part of this sprawling 
nation of 210 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Separatist leader Jose Alexandre ``Xanana'' Gusmao called for a  
big turnout, then received a hero's welcome when he voted at the 
U.N. polling station in the Indonesian capital of Jakarta, where he 
is under house arrest. 
</P>
<P>
	A large crowd clapped and cheered when Timor's spiritual leader  
and 1996 Nobel Peace Prize winner, Bishop Carlos Belo, voted at a 
Dili schoolhouse. 
</P>
<P>
	In Sydney, Jose Ramos Horta, who shared the Nobel prize with  
Belo, joined several hundred East Timorese refugees now living in 
Australia and New Zealand in casting his vote. 
</P>
<P>
	``For peace in Timor and all those who died in the past 23  
years,'' Ramos Horta said as he cast his ballot. 
</P>
<P>
	Suharto, Indonesia's former authoritarian president who ordered  
the invasion, steadfastly ignored international opinion and refused 
to grant self-determination to the territory's 800,000 people.

<HEADLINE> Army May Change 'Dated' Ad Campaign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Heather Blackburn thinks the Army's image  
needs sprucing up. 
</P>
<P>
	The George Washington University student says the service's  
well-known advertising slogan, ``Be all that you can be,'' is ``not 
that contemporary ... and the Army isn't thought of that highly'' 
compared with other military branches. 
</P>
<P>
	With recruiting at a 20-year low, the Army is beginning to fear  
Blackburn's opinion may be representative of today's youth, which 
means the advertising jingle could become a thing of the past. 
</P>
<P>
	No matter that the jingle is one of the century's most popular.  
The ad campaign, said Doug Smith, spokesman for the Army Recruiting 
Command at Fort Knox in Kentucky, is getting a ``thorough 
relooking.'' Smith stressed that no decision has been made, and it 
was possible the slogan may survive in future ad campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
	Abandoning the slogan, introduced in 1981, wouldn't be easy  
because it has been so successfully identified with the Army, Smith 
said. But with this fiscal year's enlistment goal of 74,500 men and 
women expected to fall at least 7,000 short in the worst recruiting 
year since 1979, there's also a recognition that it may be time to 
jiggle the jingle. 
</P>
<P>
	Army Secretary Louis Caldera told The Associated Press that the  
slogan has ``tremendous value because it is recognizable and part 
of the military culture.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But he said it's already less prominent in Army ads, coming only  
as text at the end of more fast-paced MTV-style ads rather than as 
part of the storyline. ``The question is whether it is the right 
slogan for today's 18-to-24-year-olds,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Caldera said that while the slogan may be retained, future ads  
may appeal to the patriotic spirit of young people and promote 
opportunities for self-improvement. 
</P>
<P>
	The slogan does have some fans, though.  
</P>
<P>
	``I like the song in it,'' said Mackenzie Jessen, a George  
Washington University student from Gillette, Wyo. ``If someone 
really wanted to be in the Army, the slogan wouldn't make a 
difference.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Roland Rust, professor of advertising and marketing at  
Vanderbilt University, said the Army slogan rivals Nike's ``Just Do 
It'' for staying power. However, he said, ``You have to ask whether 
Generation X is wanting to be all that it can be.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It may be the case that the current generation is a little  
more pragmatic and short term in its orientation. They are saying, 
'What's in it for me?''' Rust said. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this year, Advertising Age magazine ranked ``Be all that  
you can be'' as the No. 2 jingle of the century, behind McDonald's 
``You deserve a break today'' and ahead of Pepsi's ``Pepsi Cola 
hits the spot.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bob Garfield, the magazine's advertising critic, contended it  
would be a mistake, in these booming economic times, to change the 
core message of the 18-year-old jingle -- that the Army offers a way 
to tap one's inner strength. 
</P>
<P>
	``When the economy is bad and money is tight, the Army looks  
magnificent, but right now it's not a very good deal unless the 
prospective recruit can see some benefit that doesn't come down to 
dollars and cents,'' Garfield said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Army plans to spend at least $92 million on an ad campaign  
aimed at increasing new enlistees next year to 80,000, Smith said. 
Other strategies include putting younger people to work in 
recruiting offices and giving new recruits time off after basic 
training to discuss the Army experience with friends back home.

<HEADLINE>  Seahawks' Fritz Shurmur Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GREEN BAY, Wis. (AP) -- Fritz Shurmur dedicated his life to  
studying, teaching and changing football. His imprint on the game 
and the men he taught to play it will be slow to fade. 
</P>
<P>
	Shurmur, the Seattle Seahawks' defensive coordinator and the  
architect of the defense that led the Green Bay Packers to their 
1997 Super Bowl victory, died of cancer at his home Monday. He was 
67. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was a good man and a good father,'' said Seahawks coach  
Mike Holmgren, who relied heavily on Shurmur during the Packers' 
run to consecutive Super Bowls. ``He was an outstanding football 
coach, but what really made him special were those other things 
first. He was a teacher ... he loved life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Shurmur spent two decades as a defensive coordinator for five  
teams and had the longest continuous tenure of any coordinator. He 
joined Holmgren in Seattle in January when Holmgren was hired as 
the Seahawks' coach and GM after seven seasons in Green Bay. 
</P>
<P>
	``He had great enthusiasm for someone who had coached as long as  
he had coached, and I fed off that,'' said Holmgren, who didn't 
agree to accept the Seattle job until Shurmur gave his approval. 
</P>
<P>
	Shurmur returned to the Green Bay area for treatment of  
esophageal and liver cancer, which was found during a routine 
checkup in May. Shurmur died at his recently completed home in 
nearby Suamico, where he and his wife had planned to retire. 
</P>
<P>
	``Fritz was a great friend and a great coach, but most  
importantly he was a great individual,'' Wisconsin Gov. Tommy 
Thompson said. ``He was spiritual and highly motivated. Fritz will 
be sorely missed by family, friends and fans of professional 
football.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Packers offensive coordinator Sherman Lewis, who worked  
alongside Shurmur for the past seven years, last spoke to Shurmur 
10 days ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was probably the most respected person in our profession,''  
Lewis said. ``Everything you're supposed to be as a teacher, he 
was. We all feel terrible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Shurmur remained in contact with friends and former players in  
Green Bay, even while his condition worsened. 
</P>
<P>
	The Packers' locker room was in a somber mood Monday, with  
several defensive players declining to speak with reporters. Green 
Bay safety LeRoy Butler, who along with his wife was especially 
close to Shurmur's family, declined comment. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's tragic,'' Packers quarterback Brett Favre said. ``We all  
hate it. We knew it was going to happen, that it was just a matter 
of time. We considered him one of the family, even though he moved 
on to Seattle.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Shurmur spent five seasons with the Packers and was instrumental  
in the team's run to consecutive Super Bowl appearances. He also 
served as a defensive coach with the Phoenix Cardinals, the Los 
Angeles Rams, the New England Patriots and the Detroit Lions. 
</P>
<P>
	Shurmur joined the Packers in 1994, replacing current Green Bay  
head coach Ray Rhodes as defensive coordinator. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were still talking football with him, even when he wasn't  
doing real well,'' Packers linebacker Bernardo Harris said. ``Fritz 
rode me a lot when he was here. I really had somebody on me, trying 
to help me improve, and I appreciated that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Shurmur was the Rams' defensive coordinator from 1983-90, and in  
1989 he developed a 2-5 ``Eagle'' defense to deal with personnel 
shortages. Los Angeles finished fifth in the NFC that year. 
</P>
<P>
	He spent three years in Phoenix before joining the Packers.  
</P>
<P>
	Shurmur was known as a defensive innovator and a premiere  
teacher of the game. He wrote four books on defense and coached for 
his entire adult life, beginning in 1954 as a graduate assistant at 
his alma mater, Albion (Mich.) College. 
</P>
<P>
	He was a defensive coach at the University of Wyoming from  
1962-70 and head coach at the school from 1971-74. A native of 
Wyandotte, Mich., he held a master's degree in education and 
received an honorary doctorate from Albion in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Holmgren assigned Shurmur's duties in Seattle to linebackers  
coach Jim Lind, who received Shurmur's endorsement. Holmgren was 
choked up at times during a press conference after the Seahawks' 
practice. 
</P>
<P>
	``It will take a little while'' to get over Shurmur's passing,  
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were very close.''  
</P>
<P>
	A funeral mass will be celebrated Friday at St. Francis Xavier  
Cathedral in Green Bay.

<HEADLINE> Cuba Keeps Up Boxing Protest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HAVANA (AP) -- Cuba resumed its attack Monday on the  
International Amateur Boxing Association judges who were suspended 
after a disputed match in Houston that initially gave a Russian 
fighter a victory over a Cuban. 
</P>
<P>
	Cuban sports commentators discussed the matter at length on  
government-controlled TV over the weekend and their comments were 
duly carried by the Cuba's print media on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a real organized mafia,'' sports commentator Hector  
Rodriguez said during the discussion. ``They are miserable, corrupt 
people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	President Fidel Castro promised an important announcement soon  
concerning Cuban boxing and sports in general. ``There are more 
surprising things to come,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Four of the five judges who worked the disputed match in the  
World Amateur Boxing Championships were suspended Friday by the 
executive committee of the AIBA. 
</P>
<P>
	AIBA general secretary Loring Baker said last week he was  
outraged at the diversity of scoring by the judges and vowed a 
complete investigation into the entire scoring system of amateur 
boxing. 
</P>
<P>
	Judges awarded welterweight Timour Gaidalov of Russia the gold  
medal Thursday night by a 5-3 margin over Juan Hernandez of Cuba, 
setting off an angry protest and demonstration by the Cubans. 
</P>
<P>
	Cuban heavyweight champion Felix Savon later refused to enter  
the ring for his fight and the title was awarded to American 
Michael Bennett. 
</P>
<P>
	After reviewing the Cuban protest, AIBA reversed the decision  
and awarded the gold medal to Hernandez. 
</P>
<P>
	The four officials were suspended pending a decision of AIBA's  
34-member executive committee next spring. Cases of this type carry 
a minimum period of four years to life. 
</P>
<P>
	AIBA also suspended Cuban head coach Alcides Sagarra and Jose  
Barrientos, chief of the Cuban delegation, pending a meeting of the 
executive committee. The officials were suspended for their 
demonstration following the disputed fight. 
</P>
<P>
	The suspended judges are from Bulgaria, Estonia, Mongolia and  
Argentina.

<HEADLINE> Former PairGain Employee Sentenced </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- A former employee of PairGain Technologies  
Inc. who duped investors with a fake Internet news story that drove 
up the price of the company's stock was ordered to pay $93,000 to 
people who lost money because of the hoax. 
</P>
<P>
	Gary Dale Hoke, 26, of Raleigh, N.C., was ordered Monday to  
compensate the investors who purchased PairGain stock and sold at a 
loss after the company denied the bogus report that it was about to 
be purchased by an Israeli company for $1.35 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Hoke, who did not profit from the hoax, pleaded guilty to two  
counts of securities fraud. He also was sentenced Monday to five 
months of home detention and five years of probation. 
</P>
<P>
	He was originally charged with five counts and faced a maximum  
sentence of 10 years in prison and up to $1 million in fines per 
count. 
</P>
<P>
	In a separate settlement with the Securities and Exchange  
Commission, Hoke admitted disseminating fraudulent information 
about Tustin, Calif.-based PairGain and agreed to comply with 
federal antifraud regulations in the future. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Terry Hatter dismissed prosecutors'  
recommendation of 12 to 13 months in prison, saying he was 
convinced Hoke's decision to post the fraudulent story was an 
aberration in an otherwise honorable life. 
</P>
<P>
	Hatter questioned whether the lack of Internet safeguards to  
prevent posting of false messages was partly to blame for the scam. 
</P>
<P>
	Hatter also criticized professional investors who failed to  
verify the fake report before buying PairGain stock, and said he 
was impressed by a letter in which Hoke's mother said her son was 
``a victim of the Internet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It doesn't seem right that we proceed with this matter  
criminally when we don't have protections out there,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hoke told Hatter he posted the story to counter chat room  
messages that disparaged PairGain and the value of its stock. He 
said he believed the messages were posted by traders who hoped to 
profit by driving down the price of the company's shares. 
</P>
<P>
	Hoke owned 1,000 shares of company stock and had options on  
another 5,000. He sold none of them during the hoax. 
</P>
<P>
	``As a PairGain stockholder, it just made me unhappy. I felt I  
could influence the negative remarks people were making in a 
positive way. It was stupid,'' Hoke told reporters outside the 
courtroom. 
</P>
<P>
	Hoke who was employed at PairGain's North Carolina facility as a  
computer hardware engineer when he posted the story, now works for 
a Raleigh software firm. 
</P>
<P>
	The home detention portion of the sentence was designed to allow  
Hoke to work in order to make restitution. 
</P>
<P>
	Christopher Painter, the assistant U.S. attorney who prosecuted  
the case, said Hoke wanted to make money on the deal, but got cold 
feet when the fake story generated more trading activity than he 
expected. 
</P>
<P>
	The sentence will serve as a deterrent, even though Hoke  
received no prison time, Painter said. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was ordered to pay substantial restitution and he's subject  
to a five-year period where his conduct is substantially limited,'' 
Painter said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hoke planted the story, made to look like a Bloomberg News  
Service article, by using a fake name and an Internet service that 
offers users free Web pages. Hoke then linked the Web page to 
messages about PairGain that he posted in Internet chat rooms. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators identified Hoke as its creator by tracing the Web  
page and chat room postings to his Internet service provider, said 
Painter. 
</P>
<P>
	The April 7 hoax pushed up PairGain stock more than 30 percent,  
from $8.50 per share to as high as $11.25. Trading on the stock 
that day amounted to 13.7 million shares, about seven times its 
average trading volume. The price of PairGain stock fell back to 
$9.38 per share when the company issued a statement denying such a 
deal was in the works. 
</P>
<P>
	Internet stock hoaxes commonly consist of false messages posted  
in investment chat rooms. The PairGain hoax was unique in that Hoke 
created a Web page and story credible enough to dupe even 
sophisticated investors, Painter said. 
</P>
<P>
	Those taken in included a number of professional investors,  
including James Cramer, president of the New York money management 
firm Cramer Berkowitz and co-founder of the financial Web site 
TheStreet.com 
</P>
<P>
	Bloomberg LP, parent company of the news service, has filed a  
related lawsuit against Hoke in federal court in New York City, 
seeking unspecified damages.

<HEADLINE> 'Sixth Sense' Tops Box Office Again / Box Office  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The ghostly thriller ``The Sixth Sense''  
topped the box office again this weekend, joining the ``Star Wars'' 
prequel and ``Titanic'' as the only movies to take in more than $20 
million for four straight weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	Amid eight new releases, ``The Sixth Sense'' grossed $20.1  
million, giving it a total of $138.9 million in four weeks, 
according to industry estimates Sunday. The movie stars Bruce 
Willis as a therapist to a boy who talks to dead people. 
</P>
<P>
	Buena Vista managed to capture the two top spots at the weekend  
box office. The studio's action thriller ``13th Warrior,'' starring 
Antonio Banderas as a diplomat roped into battle in 10th century 
Europe, grossed $10.3 million in its debut. 
</P>
<P>
	The last studio to have the top two slots was 20th Century Fox  
with ``Titanic'' and the re-release of ``Grease'' in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	The box office coup came as no surprise to studio officials who  
delayed the opening of ``13th Warrior'' by two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	``It seemed like a fabulous time,'' said Chuck Viane, president  
of Buena Vista distribution. ``There was nothing competitive for 
our genre at all.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Viane, though, expected some tough competition next week with  
the debut of the action-filled ``Chill Factor,'' starring Cuba 
Gooding Jr. and Skeet Ulrich. 
</P>
<P>
	With so many movies debuting this weekend, it was tough for any  
one film to garner a strong following, said Paul Dergarabedian, 
president of Exhibitor Relations Co. Inc., which tracks movie 
ticket sales. 
</P>
<P>
	``They can't all do well,'' he said Sunday. ``The favorites are  
holding well enough so it is tough for the newcomers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The Muse,'' the highly publicized comedy starring Albert  
Brooks and Sharon Stone, opened with $4.2 million for seventh 
place. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Dergarabedian said ``The Muse'' is a movie for the  
older crowd who do not typically run to the box office on the 
opening weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	``In Too Deep,'' an action film starring Omar Epps and LL Cool  
J, placed eighth with $4.1 million, and ``The Astronaut's Wife,'' 
with Johnny Depp, was 10th with $4 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Blair Witch Project,'' meanwhile, slipped from No. 5 and  
tied for eighth place with $4.1 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The low-budget shocker has grossed $128 million, since it opened  
in wide release five weeks ago, making it one the most successful 
independent films in history. 
</P>
<P>
	Estimated grosses for Friday through Sunday at North American  
theaters, according to Exhibitor Relations Co. Inc. Final numbers 
were expected today. 
</P>
<P>
	1. ``The Sixth Sense,'' $20.1 million.  
</P>
<P>
	2. ``13th Warrior,'' $10.3 million.  
</P>
<P>
	3. ``Runaway Bride,'' $6.9 million.  
</P>
<P>
	4. ``Bowfinger,'' $6.6 million.  
</P>
<P>
	5. ``Mickey Blue Eyes,'' $5.4 million  
</P>
<P>
	6. ``The Thomas Crown Affair,'' $4.7 million.  
</P>
<P>
	7. ``The Muse,'' $4.2 million.  
</P>
<P>
	8. (tie) ``In Too Deep,'' $4.1 million.  
</P>
<P>
	8. (tie) ``The Blair Witch Project,'' $4.1 million.  
</P>
<P>
	10. ``The Astronaut's Wife,'' $4 million.

<HEADLINE> Park City Residents Hope To Profit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PARK CITY, Utah (AP) -- Owners of hotels, homes and condos hope  
the 2002 Winter Olympics will bring a windfall in rental profits, 
while Olympic organizers have taken aggressive steps to discourage 
gouging. 
</P>
<P>
	Experts in the field caution that hotel owners betting on raking  
in tourist dollars could be left empty-handed. 
</P>
<P>
	The Salt Lake Organizing Committee already has locked up 19,000  
of the 21,000 beds it will need for athletes, sponsors and others 
in 2002. 
</P>
<P>
	In quiet deals with scores of hotels and property managers in  
the past two years, SLOC has inked contracts limiting what Olympic 
visitors can be charged. 
</P>
<P>
	John Sindelar, director of accommodations for SLOC, said the  
committee has not yet considered contracting with private 
homeowners. He expects most of the 70,000 visitors who will come to 
the games each day to stay with family and friends. 
</P>
<P>
	Prior games in Atlanta and Calgary also tried to control the  
market. 
</P>
<P>
	The standard SLOC arrangement sets a rate about 50 percent  
higher than the properties charged at the peak of the winter ski 
season in 1997-98. 
</P>
<P>
	``We could've done better,'' said Russ Olsen, general manager of  
the Stein Eriksen Lodge in Park City. ``On the other hand, we 
wanted to be part of the Olympic movement and help out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Forty-five of the lodge's 130 rooms have been claimed by SLOC at  
rates ranging from $750 to $1,350 a night. 
</P>
<P>
	But Stein Eriksen is one of Park City's most expensive  
properties. Even in boom times, hotel rates in the area averaged 
closer to $250. 
</P>
<P>
	About 4,500 of Park City's roughly 5,000 condos have yet to be  
corralled by SLOC. But in the neighboring Heber Valley, site of 
biathlon and cross-county events, a scarcity of commercial lodging 
led to speculation that homeowners could make thousands renting out 
their homes during the 17-day Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	Carolyn Hogwood, founder of a Heber Valley business catering to  
the Olympic-speculation market, said she signed up about 10 
homeowners and fielded numerous queries from abroad asking about 
housing availability. 
</P>
<P>
	She hasn't inked any contracts, but believes homeowners might be  
able to charge as much as $200 a night per person. 
</P>
<P>
	In Park City, most hotels are similarly booked by SLOC.  
</P>
<P>
	But Robyn Pearson, economic-development director for Wasatch  
County, said research of Olympics in Atlanta, Calgary and Nagano 
shows some who tried to make money on the games were disappointed. 
</P>
<P>
	That was the case in Atlanta, said Bill Howard, vice president  
of marketing, tourism and communications for the Atlanta Convention 
and Visitors Bureau. 
</P>
<P>
	``The anticipated need didn't happen,'' he said. ``Most people  
who put quite a bit of money into short-term corporations to market 
private homes ended up losing their butts.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Hogwood said Atlanta is different because of its size and  
hotel base, and that Calgary is a better comparison. 
</P>
<P>
	Jerry Joynt, vice president of communications for the Olympic  
Calgary Committee, said private homeowners near venues cashed in on 
the Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	``It happened, definitely, in Calgary,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> More French Bank Restructuring Seen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PARIS (AP) -- Banque of France governor Jean-Claude Trichet said  
today that he expected further restructuring in France's banking 
sector in the wake of the merger of BNP and Paribas. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our banking sector restructuring is not complete,'' Trichet  
said in an interview with Europe 1 radio. ``There is still work to 
be done. We are going to continue with the sector restructuring 
calmly and with strength and hard work.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Trichet spoke two days after French banking regulators put an  
end to a six-month banking war by ruling that the BNP would not be 
allowed to keep its 37 percent minority stake in Societe Generale. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision left BNP with investment bank Paribas, while the  
isolated Societe Generale is now at the mercy of a foreign 
predator. In March, BNP had launched a hostile bid for Paribas and 
Societe Generale, which were in the midst of a friendly merger. 
</P>
<P>
	BNP's ambitious plan would have created Europe's biggest bank.  
Together with Paribas, BNP is now France's first bank and Europe's 
third in terms of assets. 
</P>
<P>
	Trichet welcomed the BNP-Paribas merger, saying the new bank was  
``a tremendous project.'' He also stressed that ``Societe Generale 
is not for sale.'' 
</P>
<P>
	BNP chairman Michel Pebereau said in an interview published  
Sunday with the Journal du Dimanche that he did not plan to make a 
new run for Societe Generale and intended to focus on implementing 
the BNP-Paribas merger.

<HEADLINE> Japan's Jobless Rate at Record High </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Japan's jobless rate in July remained at the  
previous month's record high 4.9 percent, the government announced 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The unemployment rate has worsened in recent months, increasing  
pessimism about the nation's economy, which is struggling through 
its worst downturn in 50 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Economists surveyed by Dow Jones Newswires in Tokyo had forecast  
the overall jobless rate would stay at 4.9 percent in July. 
</P>
<P>
	The unemployment rate for men stayed at 5.1 percent, also a  
record high. The rate was also unchanged for women at 4.6 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The overall jobless rate stood at 4.8 percent in March and April  
before improving to 4.6 percent in May.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Open Gets Underway </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Philip King was delighted when he drew former  
Wimbledon champion Richard Krajicek as today's first-round opponent 
in the U.S. Open tennis championships. 
</P>
<P>
	He figured it could have been worse.  
</P>
<P>
	``My last tournament, I was drawn against Pete Sampras,'' said  
King, from Long Beach, Calif. ``I thought, `Can we do it again?''' 
</P>
<P>
	The 17-year-old King was given a wild card into the century's  
final Grand Slam tournament by winning the USTA National Boys' 
18-and-under championship earlier this month in Kalamazoo, Mich. He 
also participated in last Wednesday's draw ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
	In their first-round match in Los Angeles in July, King lost  
6-1, 6-2 to Sampras. But the young right-hander put a positive spin 
on it. 
</P>
<P>
	``California helped me out a lot,'' King said of the loss to the  
world's top-ranked player. ``I can do the same here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	King, who also won the Easter Bowl Boys' 18 title in Grenelefe,  
Fla., in April, wanted to play Krajicek ``on center court before a 
packed crowd'' in Arthur Ashe Stadium. Instead, the match was 
scheduled for 10,000-seat Louis Armstrong Stadium, until two years 
ago the centerpiece of the National Tennis Center. 
</P>
<P>
	The opening match in Arthur Ashe Stadium, which seats more than  
22,000, is be 10th-seeded Arantxa Sanchez-Vicario, the 1994 U.S. 
Open winner, against Australian teen-ager Jelena Dokic, a qualifier 
who surprised top-seeded Martina Hingis in the first round at 
Wimbledon. 
</P>
<P>
	Hingis, who captured the U.S. Open two years ago, takes the  
court tonight against Kveta Hrdlickova of the Czech Republic. 
</P>
<P>
	Also scheduled to play today was third-seeded Venus Williams,  
who captured her fifth title of the year Saturday when she defeated 
No. 2 Lindsay Davenport in the final of a tournament in New Haven, 
Conn. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the past, Lindsay overpowered me,'' the 19-year-old  
Williams said. ``But I've gotten older and stronger, and I have 
better technique.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That was evident in Williams' blistering groundstrokes, huge  
serves and quicker court coverage, all too much for the 23-year-old 
Davenport to handle. 
</P>
<P>
	``Venus is going to be tough to beat,'' Davenport said of  
Williams' chances at the Open. ``She's athletic and extremely fast. 
Those are some great assets to have.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In another early match, sixth-seeded Amanda Coetzer of South  
Africa took on Romanian Irina Spirlea, who is best known for 
bumping Williams during their semifinal match in Arthur Ashe 
Stadium two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	In the men's draw, the top-seeded Sampras is going for his fifth  
U.S. Open title and a record 13th Grand Slam tournament title. No. 
2 Andre Agassi is seeking to build on his French Open victory and 
runner-up finish at Wimbledon, and Patrick Rafter is going after a 
third consecutive U.S. Open win. 
</P>
<P>
	But there are newcomers who could topple any of them, including  
Russian teen-ager Marat Safin, who faces Sampras in the first 
round. Safin also is coming into the Open with confidence, having 
won a tournament Sunday in Brookline, Mass., upsetting Britain's 
Greg Rusedski 6-4, 7-6 (13-11). 
</P>
<P>
	Mark Philippoussis, who played in his first Grand Slam  
tournament final here last year, has withdraw from this year's 
tournament because of a knee injury he suffered during a 
quarterfinal match against Sampras at Wimbledon. 
</P>
<P>
	Felix Mantilla was moved into the 11th-seeded Philippoussis'  
place in the draw and seeded 17th.

<HEADLINE> Vice President Cuts Vacation Short </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WILMINGTON, N.C. (AP) -- Vice President Al Gore and his family  
cut short their beach vacation as Hurricane Dennis bore down on the 
North Carolina coast. 
</P>
<P>
	The Gores left their borrowed Figure Eight Island home Sunday  
afternoon on the advice of military aides who talked with National 
Weather Service meteorologists, said Tommy Taft, a Greenville 
attorney and family friend. 
</P>
<P>
	``They didn't want to leave,'' Taft said. ``But with the weather  
deteriorating and with evacuation orders about to be posted, they 
made the decision to go back to D.C.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The vice president, his wife, Tipper, and a daughter, son-in-law  
and infant grandson arrived in Wilmington on Aug. 20 with plans for 
a 12-day vacation. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Hurricane Leaves South Carolina </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MYRTLE BEACH, S.C. (AP) -- They lost tourist dollars, not homes.  
They gained much-needed rain after a record drought. 
</P>
<P>
	As Hurricane Dennis became North Carolina's problem, the mantra  
along the South Carolina coast was clear: Things here could have 
been much, much worse. 
</P>
<P>
	``We get these scares quite a bit,'' said Marcus Ammons, 25, who  
headed for the store in Surfside Beach for treats late Sunday after 
having stocked up on supplies the day before. ``We've kind of 
gotten used to it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Charleston, about 90 miles south, officials closed emergency  
shelters on Sunday evening because only 40 people showed up. And 
this morning, Gov. Jim Hodges ordered National Guard troops sent 
home, saying the worst of the threat has ended. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Hurricane Center warned that onshore winds still  
could produce storm surge flooding of 2 feet to 4 feet above normal 
tides, and heavy surf advisories were issued. 
</P>
<P>
	The staff at the Holiday Inn Oceanfront were ready to be blasted  
by Dennis. All outside tables and chairs were cleared from the deck 
because ``when they start flying, they fly like missiles,'' 
security officer Henry McCray said. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the absence of tourists -- whose slow-moving caravans  
streamed inland in hard-falling rain on Sunday -- seemed destined to 
become Dennis' biggest fallout here. 
</P>
<P>
	Phyllis Baio of Colchester, Conn., and her boyfriend, Mike  
Akridge, sat in the ice cream parlor at the Sea Mist Resort, 
lamenting the loss of sales from their traveling business. 
</P>
<P>
	The couple, who sell video games at flea markets, said the storm  
had driven away much of their weekend sales. They took in $400, 
compared with $1,500 in a typical weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've been through worse,'' said Ms. Baio, 34, who spends much  
of the summer at a beach cottage in Matunuck, R.I., and is 
accustomed to storms. ``We've weathered a lot of hurricanes right 
on the beach in Rhode Island. We're used to the preparation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although Dennis stayed well off the South Carolina coast as it  
headed north, it dumped needed rain along the shore, including 2 
inches at Myrtle Beach. 
</P>
<P>
	Akridge, 41, welcomed the rain.  
</P>
<P>
	``Rain up on the roof makes me sleep real good,'' he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- All-Star catcher David Nilsson, who broke his  
right thumb during a game at San Diego last weekend, was put on the 
15-day disabled list Monday by the Milwaukee Brewers. 
</P>
<P>
	Nilsson, 30, was hurt when hit by a foul tip in the first inning  
Saturday. He was batting .311 with 21 home runs and 62 RBIs through 
112 games this season. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a chance he'll come back for the last two weeks, but  
we'll see,'' Brewers manager Jim Lefebvre said. ``We don't know how 
it's going to heal or whatever the situation is. They said it's a 
two-to-three-week situation, so we're just going to play it by 
ear.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Milwaukee recalled catcher/infielder Brian Banks from Triple-A  
Louisville. Banks, 28, spent most of the season with the Brewers 
and was sent down Aug. 20 when Jeromy Burnitz was activated from 
the DL.

<HEADLINE> Arab Games Roundup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AMMAN, Jordan (AP) -- Egypt won three more events on Monday to  
finish on top with 105 gold medals at the Arab Games, which were 
marred by confusion, disorganization and missed schedules. 
</P>
<P>
	Tunisia finished second with 40 golds, while Algeria was third  
with 34, according to unofficial tallies. Organizers have rarely 
provided official results until several hours after the day's 
events. 
</P>
<P>
	Egypt won 20 swimming races, including 10 by Rania Alwani, a  
U.S. medical student. 
</P>
<P>
	The games were marked by unprecedented violence when Libyan  
soccer fans rioted at two matches. Players complained about 
refereeing and lack of facilities. 
</P>
<P>
	After officials announced earlier this week that six  
bodybuilders had been disqualified, organizers two days later 
mentioned only five athletes and gave a different nationality for 
one of them. There was no clarification as to which version was 
correct. 
</P>
<P>
	An unofficial tally shows Egypt will end with 105 gold medals,  
79 silvers and 79 bronzes. Tunisia is second with 40 golds, 40 
silvers and 57 bronzes, and Algeria third with 34 golds, 31 silver 
and 35 bronze.
